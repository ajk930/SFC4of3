Hedervary delivered a speech in defense
of Premier von Koerber, to the manifest
Irritation of the Kossuth and Apponyl
parties, the members of which constantly
interrupted his speech. The Premier, sat
down amid great uproar-, and cries' of
"Why did you not repel Von Koerber 1 s

the members of all parties .with the re
sult that Francis Kossuth movea' a res

It is feared that the Austrian advisers
of the crown will regard the defeat \ of
Count Hedervary as a personal affront to
the Emperor and apprehensions are felt
regarding the outcome of the crisis.
The situation is critical. It seems doubt

to impress' his peaceful policy on hi- fol

Hedervary resigned in consequence of his
own party voting "against him on the
ground that his repudiation of the at
tacks made by the Austrian Premier, Dr.
von Koerber, upon â¢ Hungarian national
rights In the Relchsrath ! was not pro
nounced enough. Premier von Koerber
had stated that Austria was prepared to
go to war in defense of Emperor Francis

demands, and that It would not yield to
the latter.

A telegram received here from the' camp
of General Zonticheff, the commander in
chief of the Macedonian insurgents, at
Razlog (fifty-five miles from Sofia),
announces that a general rising was pro
claimed on September 27, In the dis
tricts of Razlog, Novrokop, Demlrhissar,
Melnik and Seres, and that all of the in
surgent bands in Eastern Macedonia had
received direct orders to begin operations.
The chief hope of the revolutionary or
ganization now- centers in the-outbreak
in Eastern Macedonia, which is .expected
to assume considerable proportions, ' as
the leaders there are all officers of the
Eulgarian reserve. This, the sym
pathizers with .; the Macedonian cause
hope, will arouse a war feeling In the
Bulgarian army: and force the' Govern
ment to espouse the Macedonian cause.
Dispatches received here from various
sources say General Zontichen* has bc-en
greeted everywhere with the greatest en
thusiasm and that all the peasants are
flocking to his banner.
A letter from: Philippopolis, dated yes
terday, says the authorities there have

The insurgents are attacking Butchevo

gent hands and the Turkish troops. The
sound of artillery is plainly heard at

The statement in part follows:
"As regards the Miller case. I have little
to add to what I have already said. In
dealing with it. I ask you to remember
that I am dealing purely with the relation
of the ' Government to its employes. 1
must govern my action by the laws of
the land, which I am sworn to administer,
and which differentiate any case in which,
the Government of the United States is a
party from all other cases whatsoever.
These laws are enacted. for the benefit 6t
the whole people, and cannot and must
not be construed as permitting discrimi
nation against some of the people. I am.
President of all the people of the United
States, without regard to creed, color,
birthplace, occupation or social condition.
My aim Is to do equal and exact justice
as among them all. In the employment
and dismissal of men in the Government
service- 1 can no more recognize the fact
that a man does or does not belong to
a union as being for or against him than
I can recognize the fact that he Is a Pro
testant or a Catholic, a Jew or a gentile,
as being for or against him.
"In the communication sent me by
various , labor organizations* protesting
against the retention of Miller In the
Government Printing Office the grounds
alleged are two fold. First, that he 13 a
non-union man; second, that he Is not
personally fit. The question of his per
sonal fitness is one to be settled In the
routine of administrative detail and can
not be allowed to conflict with or to com
plicate the larger question of Govern
mental discrimination for or against him
or any other man because he is or is not
a member of a union. This is the only
question now before me for decision, and
as to this my decision is final."
LABOR LEADERS DISSATISFIED.
From the manner of the labor leaders
as they came from the White House it
was evident that they were not entirely
satisfied with the result of their Interview.
They declined to be Interviewed, Gompers
referring the reporters to the statement
thati would be given out by the President's
secretary regarding the Miller case.
While he was talking one of his associ
ates wished it to be Impressed on the re
porters that J.he President's statement
should be understood by them to be an en
tirely "Independent statement." and not'
as an answer to the councll'3 request.
The council also brought to the atten
tion of the President several matters of
legislation In which It is interested.
Among these is the enforcement of the
eight-hour and the antl-lnjunctlon btr.s
which passed the. House of. Representa
tives at the last session of Congress. The
President, Gompers said, expressed him
self as favorable to the principles of the

Miller of the Government Printing Office,
who was dismissed because he had been
expelled from the local Bookbinders"
Union and afterward waa reinstated by
direction of the President, was the prin
cipal topic of discussion. The conference
was granted at the request of the labor
leaders. The Miller case was very fully
presented by the members of theÂ» execu
tive council. Then the President made a
statement In which he announced that tats
decision not to dismiss Miller was final,
and that the question of Miller's personal
fitness must be settled in the regular rou

ridor. The next step was easy. They
tllmbtd up the bars of the corridors and
reached the top of the cells. Three feet
above them are a number of ventilators
covered on the inside with iron netting
and on the outside, stationed in the
bricks, are the iron bars. The netting
was easily removed on the inside and
.then the removal of the bars was an easy
matter, as was discovered upon exami
nation. The vertical bars were held to
gether by two flat bars of steel, which
were horizontally laid between the bricks
cf the outer wall and which were re
moved by heavy kicks.
The ventilator was then just an open
ing large enough for the men to crawl
through, which they must, have done, and
then caÂ£ie a twenty-foot drop to the soft
earth beneath. ThÂ«y chose the ventilator
adjoining the Superintendent of Schools'
office, as the ground at this place is un
pavtd, having been left for garden pur
poses. The place where they made the
escape is near the main street, in the
heart of the town.
In the local jail there are two sets of
cells. The ones in the upper tier are for
the felons and the ones beiow are for the
petty offenders. In the lower cage the
cells' are not locked at night, but the cor
ridor cage is locked. The men who es
caped had Ftoleh a staple used to hold
the electric lights In the cell and late at
night commenced their work. For a
hammer a piece of stone wound with a
piece of blanket to deaden the sound was
used.
SANTA CRUZ, Sept. 29.â There was a

ers last night the case of Patrolman
James F. Dennan, charged with unofflcer
like conduct, came up for final disposal.
The complaint against Dcnr.au was that
he created a disturbance with his wife in
a lodging-house on Seventh street. At
the first hearing of the charge a week
ago Commissioner Hutton was in favor
of discharging Dennan from the force,
but an adjeurnment of the matter was
taken until yesterday, when the board
fined the patrolman $100. The charge
against Patrolman Clew of not meeting
an obligation also came up for hearing,
but was adjourned for a week.
Patrolman Dennan Fined.
Whitworth was a prominent member ofa

he came further north and reached Port

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 29.-The auditing
board to the Commissioner of Public
.Works this afternoon held a conference
Jointly with Governor Pardee and Lieu
tenant Colonel W. H. Heuer. U. S. A.,
with reference to the proposed -weir at
Butte Slough.
' Residents of Colusa County along the
Sacramento River opposed the installa
tion of this weir on the ground that it
would force flood waters against their
levees and cause them great harm.
Butte Slough is in Sutter County, but all
the residents on the east or Sutter side
do not favor the weir. . However, those
who do claim that the Colusa ranchers
have built up leveeg to their detriment
and that it is time the Sutter ranchers
looked after \ their own interests. It is
also proposed to put in a weir at Moul
tons Break, above. Butte Slough. By so
doing the Sutter ranchers claim it, would
be possible to utilize a part of the Sutter
Basin j for. a much longer period than can
be done now.

Goldman was in court yesterday morn

case, as he would not prosecute it. The
Judge refused to do so, but suggested
that both Goldman and Snow, with their
attorneys, appear in court . this morning
when, if a satisfactory showing was
made, he would dismiss the case. ,
A. Goldman, merchant, Oakland, who
had ex-Mayor R. W. Snow of Oakland
arrested on a charge of libel, sent the
following letter to Police Judge Fritz and
Assistant District Attorney Harris:
"Having received, satisfaction for the
injury complained of by me in an action

As president and director of a number
of the principal asphalt companies in this
country, among them the Trinidad Com
pany, which owns the famous pitch lake
on Trinidad Island; the Barber Asphalt
Company and the Clovena and Statena
companies, he naturally wields an enor
mous influence in the market, and his
presence here , attended as it is with so
much secrecy, is regarded as very sig
nificant. He is also the head of a bank
ing and trust company in Washington.
Just what the mission of Mr. Barber in
this city is no one seems to know. During
the day he has been closeted with several
persons, all strangers in San Francisco,
and has refused to receive reporters.
Amzi Lorenzo Barber of Washington,
one of the important financial factors in
the great asphalt trust, which was or
ganized under his direction, has been in
this city for several days and living
quietly at the .Grand Hotel. He declined
to register upon his arrival and has since
guarded his Dresence in the city as care
fully as possible. He reached San Fran
cisco on the Central overland last Sunday
with several friends, who secured apart
ments at the Palace, while he went across
the street and asked for the best accom
modations to be had at the Grand, the
management of which assigned him to the
rooms on the first floor overlooking the
intersection of Market with New Mont

One ..morning when most- of the ship's

sand began to fall. Within half an hour
the air became so laden with the particles
that it was difficult to distinguish objects
a ship's. length distant. The sand was
generally of a light composition, much of
it drifting on the air currents. Some of It
was heavy and fell upon the deck. So
great was the downpour that the deck of
the ship was covered about Ifalf an inch
deep. The shower continued for three
days and the atjnosphere was so dense at
times that the sun 'was hidden from view.

Nothing is more distinctive of our Ameri
can republic than the peculiar fostering care
which through their representatives the people
have assumed over the education of all the
citizens In primary matters and of all those
who care to eo beyond primary matters In
those additional branches necessary as per
quisites for the attainment of leadership in
the trreat professions.
Next to the home it is the school, th<Â» col
lege, the university which do mest to deter
mine the efficiency of the Individual as a citi
zen In this great self-governing republic of
ours, and therefore those who are to shape our
citizenship of' the future put the nation in a
special sense under obligations to them.
Senator Depew was followed by Presi
dents Arthur T. Hadley of Yale, Nicholas
Murray Butler of Columbia, Jacob G.
Schurman of Cornell and Ira Remsen of
Johns Hopkins in brief congratulatory
addresses. Grover Cleveland then spoke,
making special reference to the import
ance and value of free education.- Pres
ident Flnley's inaugural address dwelt,
on the importance of locating colleges In
cities.
Mr. Cleveland in his- address said in
parft
* If we have outgrown the simplicity of our
early national life; If with the growth of ab
normal enterprises and a mad struggle for
wealth, a constant and acute solicitation for
the country's weal has been somewhat sub
ordinated; and If in our social and business
like life we can see signs of a cleavage that
may divide our people Into distinct and un
sympathetic- classes, we should be watchful.
If with these things we also discover a move
ment toward a more general collegiate educa
tion we oueht to regard It as another unfa
vorable symptom If increasing learning is to be
made only a mere ornamental accompaniment
to the unwholesome and pitiable ostentation of
riches and pride.

There was still another letter addressed
to Ed Ferot, with whom the' murderer

In another letter De Labrousse bitterly

she had forced Marie to decline to marry
him. The letter Is a vitriolic effort and

ED.
The girl was well known and highly re
fpected among her associates. It has
been known for some time that the sales
man was infatuated with her, but the
tragedy of yesterday was never antici
pated. There were three letters left by
De Labrousse. The first was to his sister,
Mrs. Lestrohan. It follows:
My Dear Sister Georgi&na: I hope, dear,
you will forgix-e me for this, but the burden
Is more than I can bear. I have stood it for
elurht months, have Buffered tortures. Night
arter night have I passed sleepless nights. X
love Marie more than any man ever cared for
a woman, but when about a.month ago, she,
backed up by her sisters, putTJW out, it was
more than" 1 could stand. I have often re
turnM and beffged and X'leaded on the street.

also suffered. AVe were attached and devoted

as you wish, only see that I have my beloved's
photograph with me. Good-by. good-by, dear
Bister. Kiss the children for me. Your
brother, who was always devoted to you.
EDMOND.
Then De Labrousse placed the revolver
against his own head and pulled the trlp
ger. The weapon missed fire and the
desperate man inspected the cartridges
and flred one shot Into the ground that
he might be aure it was in perfect order.
The next shot he aimed at his head,
Bending a bullet under his scalp, produc
ing a wound that is not necessarily fatal.
"When the salesman fell his body
crossed that of Miss Jordan. Three wit
nesses rushed to the scene and a nearby
physician was summoned. Life in the
woman was extinct, death having come
Instantly, but the man struggled and
groaned, suffering from the wound in his
head. Then it was that the murdered
woman's mother and sisters came upon
the scene. They heard the shots and
rushing from the rear of their residence
found both bodies lying across the gar
den -walk. The ambulance was sum
moned and the murderer moved to the
Central Emergency Hospital. The body
of the woman, which was pierced by
three bullets, was taken to the Morgue,
where Dr. Baclgalupi performed an au
topsy.
When Miss Jordan was on her way to'
her home at noon yesterday she was met
by her suitor at the corner of California
and Hyde streets. .Some conversation oc
curred between them, the gist of which
Is', unknown. They walked leisurely up
the street togethe.. talking- as they went,
but there seemed to be no quarrel be
tween them. When the residence of the
woman was reached hor lover suddenly
drew a revolver and flred three shGts.
The woman fell across the pathway in
the yard and died in a few moments.
killed Marie Jorda-j and made an
ineffectual attempt to send a bullet into
his own brain. It was noonday when
De Labrousse walked with the wryaan up
Sacramento street to her residence and
then fired three shots into her body.
Afterward he tested the revolver by
shooting at the ground and then pointed
the weapon at his head and tried to end
his existence. The body of the woman
was taken to the Morgue, while he,
bleeding and exhausted, was taken to the
.Central Emergency Hospital. . â¢
For five years Â£>e Labrousse wooed
M.iss Jordan. His earnest entreaties
that she become his wife were met with'
refusals and the man was driven to des
peration. He was a Falesman employed
by Wolfo & Frank and she was a clerk
employed at Cailleau's Suit Ho&se, .114
Kearny street.' Many times he called at
t-he house at 1439 Sacramento street and
urged his plea of love. Miss Jordan at
one time agreed to marry him, but recent
ly, when he lost his position, delayed the
time of marriage an indefinite period.
Several times the persistent sales'man
dispatched .messages to 'his sweetheart
urgi.ng her to have a marriage ceremony
performed immediately. She was firm
in her determination to wait until he was
financially rattled, hence the trageiiy of
yesterday.

in requesting the resignation of A. Ruef.
The advisory committee of the league
consists of the vice president and one
executive committecman from each of the
eighteen Assembly district clubs of the
league.
The attendance last night was unexpect
edly large. As the notice of the meet
ing was not officially communicated to
the members until late yesterday after
noon It was fancied that several of the
districts would bÂ© unrepresented, but the
Interest In tbe conference was so active
that every district but oneâ the Twenty
ninthâwas represented. There is no der
fection whatever in the district that did
not have a representative present.
The representatives attending were A.

ers present were Henry J. Crocker,' Re

named . was present by invitation.
The meeting was addressed by A.%.V.
Williams, Henry Ach, Henry J. Crocker,
L. A. Rea, Fred Eggers, Thomas C. Duff,
W. W. Sanderson and Charles H. Spear.
Mr. Crocker's remarks evoked great en
thusiasm. He advised that the campaign
be conducted on broad lines and that ail
factional differences be obliterated.
TO MEET CANDIDATES.
Members of the advisory committee de
cided to meet with the candidates at the
headquarters of the 'league to-morrow
evening for the purpose of considering
plans for the campaign.
The motion to Indorse the action of the
organization committee in requesting the
resignation of A. Ruef was made by H.
N. Beatty of the Thirty-sixth District
and seconded by three or four members.
In orde-r to give force and. clearness to
the expression roll call was demanded,
and every representative, including LÂ». A.
Rea*tnf the Forty-fifth District, voted to
sustain- the committee. '
Charles H. Spear, representing the State
administration, spoke eloquently of the
duty of Republicans to support the entire
ticket. The general sentiment was ex
pressed by all the speakers that the Re
publicans In this campaign fully appre
ciated their to San Francisco
and to the ""party and would vote the
straight ticket. \
It Is gossip in political circles that Hen
ry J. Crocker's vote on November 3- will
approximate 23,000. In view of the sharp
contest between Schmitz and Lane, the
triumph of Mr. Crocker is regarded as
certain. Politicians predict that the total
vote will be 58.000.. It Is figured, that
Schmitz may get 18,000, Lane 16,000 and
Whitney (Socialist) 1000. At the primary
election' the Republican vote exceeded the
combined vote of. the Democratic and
Union Labor parties. It is a sure thing
that Republican merchants this year, in
view of the ( sore experience of the past,
will not vote for the Democratic nominee,
or the candidate of Ruef and Parry. All
along the line. the Republicans are' pro
claiming:' "We vote the straight Repub
lican ticket trip." The most ardent
and confident supporters of the ticket are
the Republican business men and taxpay
ers, .who realize that something must be
done to rescue San Francisco from the
clutch, of Job chasers and tax eaters.

HOW TO JIND OUT.
Fill a bottle or coxnmon slass with your
water and let It sta^d twenty-four hours;
a sediment or settling Indicates an un-
healthy condition of the kidneys; If it
stains the linen It is evidence of kidney
trouble; too freqr:nt desire to pass It, or
pain In tbe back Is also convincing proof
that the kidneys and bladder are out of
order.
WHAT TO DO.
There Is comfort In the knowledge so
often expressed that Dr. Kilmer" 3 Swamp-
Root, the great kidney and bladder rem-
edy, fulfills every vish In curing; rheuma-
tism, pain In the back, kidneys, liver,
bladder and every part of the urinary
passage. It corrects inability to hold wa-
ter and scalding pain In passing it. or bad
effects following use of liquor, wine or
beer, and overcomes that unpleasant ne-
cessity of r oing compelled to go often dur-
ing the day, and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the ex-
traordinary effect of Swamp-Root is sooa
realized. It stands the highest for its
wonderful cures of the most distressing
cases. If you need a medicine you should
have the best. Sold by druggists in nfty-
cent and one-dollar sizes.

Dr. Ravold.made for St. Louis in dump

clusions would show t^s experiment , to
be so valueless an to be "quite unworthy

burg and father of the nrst King of Prus
sia, ordered dice to be brought. In order
that the two soldiers should throw for
death, the loser to be executed as the
murderer.
This trial by pfiance was conducted with
great pomp and ceremony, the great elec
tor attending in person to superintend
this appeal to divine intervention, for as
such he regarded it. Rudolph had the
first throw, and he threw two sixes, thus
obtaining the highest possible number.
-On seeing this Alfred fell to his knees
and prayed: "Almighty God, thou know
est that I am guiltless. Protect me, I
beseech thee." Then hÂ«t!Â»rew the dice
with such, force that one of them broke
Into two r>arts. The one that hafiJ re
mained unbroken showed six, one-half of
the broken dice also showed six, while
the second portion of the broken dice
showed one, thus giving Alfred a total of
thirteen, or one more than Rudolph had,
thrown. : . Â° !

Louisiana and Mississippi furnish the

and rice plantations. The corn crop is al
ready made, and is the best In ten years
âin many sections a full two years' sup

It was alleged in the indictment that Tie
had "maliciously and feloniously appro
priated and embezzled, for his own use,
the sum of J50O.00O."
"What say you?" he was asked. "Are
you guilty or not guilty?"'
"The amount Involved." haughtily re
sponded the prisoner, "Is a sufficient an

NEW YORK, v Sept. 29.-Mtss": Marion
Jones, daughter of. former United "* States
Senator John P. Jones of Nevada, was
married to Robert Fdrquahar of this city
In Grace Church, to-day. Former Senator
Jones gave the bride away. -
The Invitations are- out for the Friday
Fortnightly cotillons which will be held
at the Palace Hotelâ the first on Novem
ber 27, the second December 30, the third
January 22 and the last on February 5.
The debutantes are radiant with ex
pectations, and it looks promising that
much life will be infused ; into these
rather serious affairs by this buoyant
bevy of buds. '
The Contemporary Club held two enjoy
able meetings during September. The
first was- devoted to club interests and
the second to a lecture on "Art in
Japan," by Miss Katherlne Ball. Many
exquisite curios were used In illustration.
Miss Rheinstein delighted the audience
with two piano solos.
The first day of meeting of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy will be
held at 2111 California street on Monday
October 5, at 10 a. m. The second day
the society will meet at Century Hall
1215 Sutter street, at the same hour.
At both of these meetings it is expect
ed that only the Daughters of the Con
federacy will. be present/ An Intensely
Interesting session is anticipated.
The attendants at the ceremony will be*
Maid of honor, Miss Helen A. Hopper,
sister of the groom; best man, William
G. Judge; ushers, Harry F. Hopper,
George C. Thompson, Arthur J. Donovan'
George Forderer. Dr. Arthur T. (McGlnty
and David F. Buckley.
After the ceremony a reception and
banquet will be held at the Sorosis club
rooms. Th,e happy pair will make a tour
of the Southern States, after which they
will set up their household gods In this
city.
Dr. Hopper is one of the most popu
lar and sv-::cessful physicians in the city
among the younger set, at present oc
cupying the position of assistant city
physician.
The v/edding of Miss Alice Frances
Donovan and Dr. William C. HopDer will
take place at St. Mary's Cathedral to
morrow night, the Rev. Peter C. Yorke
officiating. The bride is a girl of strik
ing individuality and style, and has de
voted much time to the study of music;
besides this accomplishment,, she pos
sesses the rarest of all social attainments,
the ability to converse well, which to- 7
day is almost a lost art.
The lecturer lightened the sympathetic
depression of the ladlesâ who didn't miss
a word of the story from start to finish
by chanting some songs from the Sant
hals, a people in the north of India: They,
like all the songs of primitive peoples,
gave forth the minor wall, like the
plaints of lost souls. They lacked utterly
a note of j|yousness or buoyancy.
After, the lecture" Dr. Sundborg was
fairly stormed with "questions abo * the
mystic country of the rajah; having sur
vived the bombardment he was enter
tained by the gracious president, Mrs.
George Law Smith, at the teatable, as
sisted by the full complement of the club.
The lecturer stated that at the present
day, and among all castes, the. child-wife
is still a part of the social structure.
Ofttimes in the cradle marriage is con
tractedâthis Is In the nature of an Irre
vocable betrothaL Then at the mature
age of 11 or 12 the wife takes up her
abode under her husband's roof tree. In
the city of Bagdad it is not uncommon to
Fee a girl of 8 or 9 fulfilling the duties of
wifehood, and on being widowedâ should
she escape the horrors of interment with
her husbandâ following to its bitter end a
most abject and deplorable life, for the
death of her husband clearly demon
strates that she Is accursed and an un
clean thing. The lecturer was questioned
about the mental development of these
creatures, who, through all these cen
turies of tyranny and oppression, have
not risen" against their wrongsâ except in
sporadic cases, as the Ramabalâ and the
answer was t5:.at - there was almost no
mental expansionâ and scarcely any spir
itual or moral development.
Previous to his. diplomatic appointment
the lecturer followed the profession of
medicine In this city and it was this
technical knowledge that enabled him to
cr me In close touch with the hidden lives
of the women of the Far East. As Is well
known, the Mohammedan harem Is for
bidden to the unclean sight of the unbe
lieverâand therein lies the Intense Inter
est in Dr. Sundborg's observations.
Among the many points developed were
these: That prior to the Mohammedan
invasion the women of India were socially
and religiously the equals of men, and
their companions In all things. But with
the advent of tlv* sword and sclmlter
the Hindoos found it necessary to secrete
the women for protection from the gross
invaders, and thus came to be established
the custom of isolation, with Its accom
panying characteristics of stagnation and
retrogression. Said the speaker, "The one
redeeemable trait brought to India by
the Islamites was their creed of temper
ance, but this was far offset by the degra
dation to which they brought woman
kind."
THE California Club entertained
Its guests and members yesterday
by a delightful lecture on India,
given by Dr. John C. Sundborg.
former United States Consul at
Bagdad. The talk, illustrated as It was
by more than 100 lantern slides, will live
long in the annals of the club as one of
distinctive value and Interest.
NEW \ HAVEN, Conn., Sept. 29.â The
Evening Register says: A director
of the Consolidated Lake Superior
Company said to-day In this city
that the plan of reorganization which
was being prepared by a committee of the
board of directors would be made public
in Philadelphia in a few days. This plan
had been agreed upon by the directors
and was now being worked out in detail
by the executive committee and was
said to be satisfactory to all of the Phila
delphia stockholders and many in New
York and Canada.
"In general it means," said the director,
"making the capital of the company
$40,000,000, and levying an assessment of
$3 per share on the stock outstanding.
The appointment of a receiver was
agreed to b'y the stockholders and direct
ors because there were the syndicate
creditors as well as the Canadian credit
ors to be protected, and the receivership
protects the property for the creditors as
well as for the stockholders."
The director denies the report that the
United States Steel Corporation was anx
ious to secure the property.

would naturally handle much of the
money. He wishes each member of the
organization In the United States to be
assessed $1, which .would create a fund
of $80,000 to start with. He will. It is
said, also present a resolution for the
convention's consideration providing for
the assessment of one day's wages
against every Iron worker In the United
States. Thia would. It Is estimated, raise
a fund of half a million dollars to be
used in fighting the New York employers.
It Is predicted by some of the delegates
to-night that the convention is on the eve
of disruption. Parks' plan to raise money
by assessment. It is said, will arouse so
much opposition that either he will be
deposed before the new officers are
elected or his opponents will walk out

Samuel Parks, the New York walking
delegate, is planning to make the most of
his opportunities.- The following resolu
tion introduced to-day Is expected to
cause a fight when it Is acted upon to
morrow:
Wolcott was chosen temporary chair- I
man of the convention without opposition ;
and in a carefully prepared speech de- !
nounced his opponents in the Republican â¢
party. A strongly worded resolution in- j
dorsing President Roosevelt for re-elec- I
t*on to the Presidency in 1904 was unani- j
mously adopted without reference to the ;
committee on resolutions. Only one of- ,
fi ce _that of Justice of the Supreme j
Courtâ is to be fi'oed at this year's elec- j
tion and for this Chief Justice John !

I Citizens' Independent Democracy, the or-
I ganlzation headed by Congressman Fran
j cis Burton Harrison, declaring the organ

Fornes.
District Attorney Jerome, whose whirl
wind campaign was the feature of the
j canvass on the fusionist Bide two years
ago. and who has heralded his dissatisfac
tion with Mayor Low's administration
course, though he avowed his purpoaj of
supporting the fusion cause this year,
made a declaration to-night which those
j who heard ft construed as signifying that
under certain conditions he might give
his adherence to the Tammany Hall
ticket.
. ''If," Jerome is quoted as saying, "a
guaranty be given befdre the Tammany
Hall convention on Thursday next of the
sincerity of the movement, and that those
men are sincere and honest, I am going
to stand by It, and if those men are han
dled as they should be and if men are put
in nomination whom honest men can sup
port and people will say, 'We have an
honest movement,' I will encourage it.
"I have stood for certain things all my i
life and will continue to stand for those
things the balance of It, no matter where
the rest of the gang goes. I will not stand :
for a ticket three-quarters of which be- I
longs to another party."
The condition to which Jerome alluded ;
in the last sentence quoted above was the
subject of a conference at the residence I
of Mayor Low, leaders of the fusionist |
forces being present. This conference was j

DENVER. Sept. 29.â Former^ United
States Senator Edward O. Wolcott won
a decisive victory to-day in the contest j
before the Republican State Central Com- j
mittee between the rival factions In this j
city and -afterward In the State conven- j
tion. The committee, by a vote of 71 to ;
S, placed the "Wolcott delegates on the !
temporary roll call of the convention and !
the convention by a unanimous vote made j
the temporary roll call permanent. No j
opportunity was given the anti- Wolcott j
delegation to make a contest before the I
convention. *
The meeting of the city committee was
apparently harmonious and adjourned
without even a suggestion as to whom the
candidates would be.
NEW YORK. Sept. 29.â The political at
mosphere, as regards the attitude of the
Kings County Democracy In the city con
vention, was cleared at the meeting of
the city committee at the Democratic
Club to-night when James Shelvin and
Senator Patrick H. McCarren announced
in no uncertain terms that if Grout and
Fornes were nominated by Tammany Hall
the Kings County Democracy would place
in nomination a ticket composed of -Lewis
Nixon for Mayor, Julian D. Fairchlld
for Controller and' Herman A. Metz for
president of the Board of Aldermen.
The announcement by Shevlln was made
after a heated discussion between him
and Charles F. Murphy, In which Murphy
announced as final that Tammany Hall,
as the majority organization, will nomi
nate all the candidates, McClellan, Grout
and Fornes.

the troops arrangements were made by
the Consolidated Lake Superior Company
to take care of the detachment, which
consisted of eighty-four men, and they
were escorted to a boat, where they will
spend the night. In the morning they will
leave for the plants of the company. The
officers expect there will be trouble.
The arrest of nine men" charged with
being implicated in the riot in the Cana
dran Soo on Monday, and an attempt by
a number of the men forcibly to resist de
tention at Wilde Station, on the Algoma
Central, were among the developments in
the situation yesterday. Numerous re
quests by employment agencies for the
services of men thrown out of work by
the closing of the concern and its various J
affiliated companies have given the men ;
hope, and with the exception of the Incl- j
dents mentioned everything was quiet '\u25a0

J. J. FULTON CO.â Gentlemen: I feel that
myself snd every one else having need of your
Compound have valid reason for making sharp
criticism of your business methods.
On April Hth of t*is year, while suffering
from severe kidney trouble, I entered the Lion
drug store in your city seeking a remedy. They
told' me of the Fulton Compound, and I bought
it. Later I was able to get another bottle in
Salem. Later, after being out of it two weeks,
I dug up another In Portland. After that 1 was
out of It two months, end finally got three, bot-
tles tn Tacoma on the 12th lnst. Since leaving
San Francisco have called the; 'attention of
many druggists and doctors and hundreds jf
others to your Compound, and many of tho lit-
ter sent for It end have told me what it has
done for them. I have talked so ardently for
it that many think I am its agent. -But
imagine my surprise on learning that the reason
why country druggists can't get it is because
they must buy $200 worth at a time. If this
be trU3 It 1b too bad, and you have no moral
right to follow methods that keep so valuable
a remedy from the public. I would not take
$100 for what the first thrÂ«e bottles did for me,
and I gave & letter to that effect to Malstrom
Bros, in Tacoma. But it discourages me, after
my large amount of gratuitous booming of your
Compound, to find that It is almost impossible
for the people to get hold of It. There are
Bwarms of sufferers seeking a remedy and
dying, with a good, thing tn the market which
they are unable to. get. Sincerely,
,'M. W. WILKINS.
Mr... Wilkins 'is not correctly Informed.
There is an agent in every city of 1000
and over on the Coast, and they can and
do buy it "even a bottle at a" time when
they so order it. And what is, more,. we
have now put Fulton's Compounds, thei
only cures the world has ever > known for
Bright's Disease and Diabetes, in every
city of. > 10,000 â¢ and over In the United
States, and are gradually putting them
into the smaller cities. Send for. litera-
ture and list of 500 agents. Jno. J. Fulton

advertisement that "Nothing like the
values we are offering during the last
\u25a0week of our removal sale have ever been
teon in San Francisco. Prices which
competition cannot meet even though it
would." In this they are making a eeri-
ous mistake. Bettor r>ianoa have been
eold by Pommer-Eilers for less money
#ver since their New Era Piano Business
waÂ« established here. Uetter piano and
â¢ irpan valut s are obtainable to-day at
Pommrr-Eilers Music Company. 6o3 Mar-
ket street, as will be seen in the sub-
joined. To bring ihi? matter forcibly to
the attention of every one, we inaugurate
to-morrow a
Great Demonstration Sale.
\\> don't pretend to deny that substan-
tial reductions have been offered by
these people in the prices of their pianos.
Hut do you believe that any sane man
would grive you a reduction of a clean
hundred dollars in the price of a ptano
fimply to save the sixty or seventy cents ;
it might cost to take the piano to a new
Mere? No, sirree: It means simply that
Pommer-Eilers' up-to-date methods are
<omj>ellinp others to adapt themselves to
the new order of things. 1
We have told you right along that the j
awakening must come sooner or later. ;
Old ideas, old prejudices, old methods, are !
bfing daily swept aside in every line of
human endeavor. Tills appeals with epe-
c-ial emphapf? to the Western Piano Busi-
neÂ«s. Pommer-Eilcrs were the pioneers j
In under-price selling of reliable pianos. '
And even though old-timers are making
progress in the right direction. Pommer-
Eiler* possess advantages that others do
not enjoy, and we Ftate once more plainly
and emphatically that we are In a posi- !
tion to sell a I
Better .Piano for Less Money
than can any other firm or agency, no
matter what the occasion, or however
plausible the excuse, that may be offered.
A Baker's Dozen Yesterday.
Exactly thirteen choice Instruments
Â«'wi> sold by Pommer-Eilers Monday.
With, probably one exception each pur-
chaser here had carefully investigated
the inducements offered elsewhere, but
finding our prices lower or our instru-
ments better for the price offered, they
invariably favored us with their patron-
age. .
Make Careful Comparisons.
See the Boudoir uprights offered at JH5 1
during the "tremendous Bargain Removal !
Sale." Is not our piano that we have '
jeen offering and selling right along for I
$137 a better and more substantial piano? I
We tell you that the pianos sold by us on j
numerous occasions for $118. and on one
occasion for as little as $3h.50, were in
every way equal to if not positively su-
perior to the so-called "big bargains,
which competition cannot meet, even
though it would." at $145. Look at our
pianos here now at 5137. and also some at
JUS. We'll abide by your decision.

every way to the above. Comparison is
solicited.
A Bargain and Not a Bargain.
In their list of bargains appears "a $275 j
Kimball, good, cheap piano (used, of '
course t. for $1S5." As is well known, i
Pommer-Eilers have never asked for or
sold the $275 style of piano made by Kim-
ball for more than $176; brand new ones
at that. Plenty of them here this morn-
ing for you to select from.
By Way of Further Comparison.
Suppose you get the lowest "removal
sale price" obtainable on a slightly used,
largest size, mottled mahogany-cased
Fischer upright. Then see what we a!-e
willing to furnish the same style of in- !
ytrument for during this demonstrati/ci i
sale. \\>*H wager that you'll be ab.e to ;
save a clean $00 by placing- your order
here.
Suppose you get the best price obtain-
able en a new fancy mahogany-cased j
Knabe upright. We doubt if you can get '
a better figure than $450. We'll accept an !
order to-day for such a piano, a new one !
accompanied by a factory warranty, for
$405, on easy payments if desired.
In Conclusion. %
Look before you leap. Three thousand â¢
purchasers have found it to their personal i
interests to buy pianos of Pommer-Eilers
during the past eighteen months. We be-
lieve it will pay you to sear our pianos
and get our prices before definitely de-
riding elsewhere. See If it isn't worth
your while. At POMMER-EILERS MU-

trounced the eleven from"- the Lick School
this afternoon to the tune of 12 to 0.
The work, however, was done . with
neither neatness nor dispatch. The fresh
men were sluggish and changed often and
the players from the Lick School 'fought
like tigers. -The freshmen scored- the
first touchdown and goal after the first
twenty minutes was ten minutes - old,
Kerns making all six points. The second
touchdown and coal were scored after
a fierce struggle near the end of the sec
ond half. There were no remarkable
plays, no runs over ten yards and not k a
player could be said to have distinguished
himself. The 'line-up was as follows: â¢

TEN-INNING BURLESQUE
PLAYED AT PHILADELPHIA
"Johnny" More has definitely decided to
get. into the game again, after flirting
with it since practice began, and is now a
candidate for quarterback on the varsity.
Mini was reported as ready to play again,
but he said to-day that he had not decid
ed what he would do and that it all de
pended on the coaches whether he played
or not. '
The original list contained fifty-three
names, but seven were rejected by the
faculty. Of these seven, one is Boothe, a
promising player, who was thought to be
ineligible on account of the limited num
ber of his studies. This matter is about
to be adjusted, however, with the Bel
mont school, of which he was a member,
and he will probably play in the fresh
men game.

A short thne ago a mule ran away near
his store, and, hearing the shouts of his
neighbors, he walked to the middle of the
street just " as the frightened animal
dashed up. "With a couple of strides he
was in the middle of the road and had
the mule by the bridle. To the conster
nation cf all the mute came to a violent
stop, falling to his knees.

away as a bachelor, but in the presence
of a handsome young wife and eight hale
and hearty children, ranging in age from
IS to 3 years, It Is quite evident that he
is shirking none of the duties of an or

Mr. Brinson balances the scales at 57U
pounds,' has a waist measure of 92 inches,

steadily increased.
He has had repeated and magnificent
offers from Northern museums to put
himself on exhibition, but has preferred
to stay at home and run his turpentine
still.

That part of the Superior Court having its being
in San Francisco and weird in the, record of its
anomalous decisions has nicked a new notch in its
remarkable career. It has decided that "knockout
drops," that deadly poison which only the predatory
and murderous minded carry, may be legally in
one's possession until an evil intent to use be estab
lished. One may as well say that the possessor of
a mask, skeleton keys, brass knuckles and a re
volver is a pillar of state until his murdered victim is
found on the street. -
The delays and procrastination; of California
courts are proverbial, but it took a San Jose man
sentenced for an offense and awaiting judgment on
appeal to state the case in its most ridiculous and at
the same time most pathetic form. He\has begged
the courts to permit him to begin his punishment
and to dismiss the appeal he has made to, the Su-
preme Court.

Mrs. Iiangley's Estate Appraised.
ONLY a short time ago President Hadley of
Yale addressed the students upon the growth
of an ostentatious luxury among the
wealthier members of the university and declared
a conviction that the intellectual life of the place
would be weakened unless some means were found
for putting a stop to the evil. Hardly had his indig
nant protest and earnest appeal died away when re
ports from the East brought the story of a freshman
arriving at the university town in a private car ac
companied by such a retinue that the railway officials
thought the president of the road had come. Evi
dently wealth at Yale continues to be ostentatious.
Time was when a freshman who would have dared
to put on the least swagger at Yale would have had
it rubbed out of him by a process that would have
left him limp for the rest of the academic year, but
under the new order of things the more swagger the
freshman can show the. more kow tow is done to him
by his admiring fellows.
Excesses at Yale sre but a reflex of the excesses of
life in New York. Recently Whitelaw Reid spoke of
the ostentation of wealth as one of the greatest evils
of our time and country. He attributed it mainly to
the desire for amusement on the part of people who
could ' not amuse themselves in any rational way.
Incapable of any esthetic or intellectual enjoyment,
the rich idlers rush to extravagance as a means of
amusing themselves. "Gregariousness and glare," he
said, "are the irredeemably vulgar notes of it all. To
seek enjoyment within yourself and your own circle,
in resources of your own, becomes unendurable.
Thus Newport rather than Biltmore becomes the
veneered and shiny national type for those who can
at will command either."
A recent reviewer in describing the cost of the
amusements of the ostentatious. set -says: "Take the
new life of sport and recreation. Twenty millions of
dollars are to-day invested in clubhouses, grounds
and equipments' for the game of golf; two millions
were spent'last year for golf clubs and balls., Eight
millions of dollars' worth of other, sporting goods,
such as are used in tennis, baseball, shooting, etc.,
were bought. More than $50,000,000 is. invested in
pleasure craft, chiefly steam yachts. Twenty-five

The irade against fusion issued by the grand Turk
of the city Democracy shoots above the lowly
wretches who want small offices and are content with
crumbs. McNab loses no tricks and has an excellent
memory. In that respect he is the Democratic
Mazeppa, and in that only, for he is as proper a
man as ever bossed a party and put up epigrams of
equal pungency whether suggested by victory or de
feat Mr. William Randolph Hearst has long dis
approved of Mr. McXab, and has even gone to the
extreme of putting him upon his blacklist, along
with Denman, Sam Brooks, Phelan and others, for
that list is formidable and was for years headed by
the name of Stephen M. White, who dared be elected
to the United States Senate without the consent of
Mr. William Randolph Hearst.
McNab has not wasted away and become anaemic
under the strain, but has remained sufficiently robust
to know the time to strike back. That time came
with the present convention. Mr. William Randolph
Hearst has been busy creating a labor party in order
to have something with which Democracy can fuse,
with him as the representative of both. He concludes
that fusion on every local candidate is the best way
to begin, and desired that this city, upon which he
conferred the inexpressible honor of selecting it for
his birthplace, should lead off. The wily McNab saw
the longings of ambition in Mr. William Randolph
Hearst running ap and down like mercury in the
stem of a thermometer and smote them with a clay
more by compelling the party to canonize against
fusion and compelling straight nominations. His
Bannockburn would not have been complete if Wil
liam Randolph Hearst had not winced and yowled
under the blow. But this was not lacking, for Wil
liam Randolph Hearst in an inspired editorial ran up
and down the gamut of regret and disappointment,
jawed the local party for not being the willing instru
ment of his ambition, and reminded it fretfully but
firmly that it and the labor party look alike to him
and he does not approve of Democrats to whom they
appear different.
Then McNab rejoiced, for he had pushed a bod
kin through the armor of the Presidential candidate
and the whole town had seen the victim wince and
heard him cry. But it is safe to say that the anti
fusion plank will stand, and if candidates want to
stand on the Democratic ticket they must step off the
labor ticket McNab's tartan is straight goods, and
the advocates of cocktail politics will have to quit
mixed drink and come to plain grog.
THE burdens laid upon the deeply distressed
Democracy of this city have been augmented
by , incurring the displeasure of Mr. William
Randolph Hearst, candidate for President and phil
osopher of fiddie-strings.
The Democratic convention resolved against fusion
and against permitting any of its nominees to accept
nomination from any other party. This policy was
dictated by sore and frequent experience. The party
under Mr. William Randolph Hearst's dictation has
fused with any old thing that came along. In 1896
it fused with the Populist?, and again did the same
in 1900. In State politics it has fused with every
thing but the Prohibitionists, and would have done
that if cloves had been passed pending the negotia
tion. Out of every fusion it has come with less
votes than it would have probably polled alone, and
in such barren results of that policy it has acquired
a prejudice against mixing.
But while the fusion habit is rejected as a party
there be individuals in the party who have it yet,
and so several candidates took pains and trouble to
provide themselves with the labor party nomina
tion in advance and then report for indorsement to
the assembled and warring regulars and horses and
carts, in convention met to point with pride, view
with alarm and reach for things. There they found
a cold-hearted determination to denounce the Mayor,
as head of the labor party, and to pick such flaws and
bore such holes in his administration as to make it
look like a colander. Having done this it is dis
tinctly out of order to permit fusion with the Mayor's
party, and the '"sooner" candidates -.vho had secured
its nomination find themselves compelled to elect
and choose between the two. Thereupon they are
sore smitten and mourn. \
The California State Board of Trade at
a meeting yesterday, by the consent of
the majority of Its members, amended
Its by-laws so as to eliminate the clause
making one member of the Chamber of
Commerce, Merchants' Association, Board
of Trade, Manufacturers' and Producers'
Association, Merchants' Exchange. Sou
thern Pacific Company and the Santa Fe
Company, members of the organization.
The purpose of the change is to permit
the Promotion Committee and the State
Board of Tarde to work as separate or
ganizations but in harmony.
Secretary Briggs of the Board of Trade
recently inaugurated a system of making
weekly reports of the number of visitors
who register at the board rooms. His
first report for the week ending Septem
ber 2G shows a total registration of 403
visitors, which is estimated ' to represent
one out of every five who call at the
rooms, and In this number there were
represented .34 States and six foreign
countries.

A FUSION CANDIDATE.
It is to be noted in this connection that our alleged
willingness to make cheap goods to meet a demand
for them is not looked upon by Mr. Fraser as a de
fect in our business methods, but rather as an evi
dence of the flexibility of our system and of the
adaptability of our people to the conditions of trade
in any particular market. Thus in speaking of our
trade in the East he says: "The American recognizes
that the purchaser is the person who decides, and if
people of the East want gaudy, good-looking mate
rial, though shoddy, he will make it for them. He
knows it is not good. He does not â outside his ad
vertising rangeâ pretend it is. It is, however, what
is wanted, and he is the man to produce what ii
wanted." .
4 It is in the opportunity given to youth, however,
that Mr. Fraser sees the chief advantage of American
business methods. On ,that score' he says: "In
England responsible positions arc given to elderly
men. It is considered that they are safe, they are
sound, they will be inclined to do nothing rash. That
is true enough. The American, however, does not
want that kind of man. He wants a man with
youthful vigor, with ideas, a man who has his way to
make, not one who is content to glide from middle
age' to an elderly age by just keeping things going
in a respectable, decorous way. So young men in
America are placed at the heads of departments.
They make mistakes. The employer, however, is
wise enough to see the young man can do something
else besides make mistakes. He forgets the occa
sional slips in recognizing merits in other directions.
A young man, therefore, feels confidence is placed in
him, and he never relaxes energy in his ardor to pro
duce something better, more attractive, something
that will lift him up and make him worth a huge sal
ary."
To these mental and moral forces rather than 'to
any advantage of sun or soil, or abundance of raw
material, Mr. Foster attributes the marvelous strides
we have made in our commercial invasion of the
markets of Europe. There can-be no question of the
soundness of his conclusion. In the hands of an unen
terprising people all our resources would have re
mained undeveloped and unexploited. It is the per
sonal factor that counts for most in the development
of any kind of civilization, and. if the American excels
the European in the industrial competition of the
age it is because he is the better business man.
JOHN FOSTER FRASER is one of those for
eigners who after a careful study of American
growth and development have come to the con
clusion that our success is due not solely to the rich
ness and* variety of our natural resources, but mainly
to the excellence of our business methods and the
daring, the energy with which our enterprises are con
ceived and carried out. He has recently published a
summary of his studies of American work and set
forth the respects in which he deems us to be su
perior to all rivals. The estimate is not wholly
complimentary and consequently may be taken as a
sincere effort to gauge our place in the business
world. It is therefore an interesting chapter of Euro
pean criticism upon us and helps us to understand the
impression we are making upon the world.
The American, says Mr. Fraser, is more optimistic
than the Englishman; he succeeds largely because he
has an abiding confidence that he cannot do other
wise than succeed. The failure of this or that man in
business in Europe makes other men cautious and
hesitating, but in America when a number of men in
any line fail their rivals, instead of being alarmed by
the failures, look upon them as events which have
removed competitors from the field and grow more
confident than ever. Again the American is a better
advertiser than the Briton; he has more adaptability
and more readily meets the demands of trade in all
parts of the world; he is more watchful of the public,
more prompt to supply what the public desires; more
over he pays better wages and salaries than are paid
by European business men, and finally he is younger
and more enterprising than his European rivals.
The points in which Mr. Fraser deem us inferior
to the British are, first, a willingness to furnish cheap
articles instead of good ones and, second, a tendency
to seek quantity of product rather than quality. To
those characteristics he attributes much of the suc
cess we have attained in competition with British
manufacturers. Thus he says: "Recently I traveled
by the Trans-Siberian line across Asia. Most of the
rails were American. They were not of good quality.
Indeed they were poor stuff. English firms had been
given an opportunity to provide rails for this line, but
they could not produce the article they usually manu
factured at the price the Russian Government was
willing to pay. So England lost millions of pounds.
Neither could American firms produce a good article
for the price. But they could produce an article of a
sort, money's worth, and if it was a poor article that
was not their lookout." '
WHY WE SUCCEED.
A society of professional incendiaries, who style
themselves "The Firebugs' Protective Association,"
has been uncovered in Chicago, and the police are
alert for developments which may involve prominent
business men in serious trouble. The name of this
body of dangerous operators may be new, but the
character of the society is known to every fire mar
shal in every American city. Damage by fire is un
fortunately an asset in some business firms.
Gold, copper, lead and other minerals
will be displayed as representative of all
counties where such products are found.
In fact all mineral industries will be
made known as far as possible. Collectors
are in' the field and are in constant com
munication with the State Mineralogist.
The exhibition of minerals from Cali
fornia to be made at St. Louis â to be
apart from the collective display of other
products of this Stateâ being placed in
the mines and mining building, will be
made conspicuous from afar, off by a
novel feature. This will be an arch, de
vi&ed by State Mineralogist Aubury,
which will be made of the representa
tive building stones of the State. Above
glittering specimens flecked with gold,
this composite architectural feature will
tower upward twenty-five feet. At first
it was intended to have two composite
arches, but the cost and the smallness
of the appropriation for all purposes
made It 'seem- advisable to have but one.
Local architects are engaged in prepar
ing various ornamental features and a
drawing will be submitted in a few days,
showing the arch as It will be.
State Mineralogist Aubury has returned
from a tour of the southern counties,
during which he arranged for collections
of minerals for St. Louis. Two months
will pass before the specimens from all
parts of the State will be in hand.
Enough is now known to warrant the ex
pectation that California's mineral rep
resentation will be excellent. The lead
ing idea pursued by Mr. Aubury is that
varied resources, and especially those for
which this State has had little credit
abroad, shall be put where they will ad r
vertise California to the best advantage.
In securing gold specimens, the plan. has
been pursued of purchasing them out
right at their actual gold value, so that
the State will have value for its money.
Great cubes will be prepared to illustrate
the gold output of California since 1S48.
Among the newer products of the State
will be shown borax, soda and niter and
turquoise specimens from San Bernardino
county, marbles and other structural ma
terials, including cement, from San Ber
nardino county; lipedolite, which Is found
in large quantities In San Diego county,
and tourmalines and other gems from
the same county: clays, terra cotta press,
ed bricks and structural materials gener
ally from Los Angeles county; petroleum
from Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los An
geles, Kerc, Fresno and other counties,
and borax from Inyo county. The oil
exhibit will be accompanied by oil sands,
illustrations of the geological formations
in whicli petroleum is discovered and
complete analyses of oils from hundreds
Of oil wells.
The hotel committee of the local bank
ers has registered 1400 persons who are
sure to attend the national convention
of the American Bankers' Association in
this 'city In October and who have ap
plied for hotel accommodations during
their stay in San Francisco. From this
It is safely inferred, considering that the
convention is some weeks distant, that
the attendance the first day of the ses
sion of the convention in the California
Theater will number 2000. '
As the time approaches for the gath
ering of American bankers in San i ran
clsco much activity Is manifested locally
A meeting of some one or another of
the sub-committees is of daily occurrence.
The various sub-committees all have one
secretary, Mr. Colburn, who acts as sec
retary for the executive committee, com
posed of the chairmen of all the sub
committees. . â¢ - â , , *
At the time the American Bankers As
sociation ia here the annual meeting or
the California Bankers* Association will
be held, so that the array of financial
magnates will embrace a liberal sprmx
ling of bankers from all the counties of
California as well as from abroad. The
programme for the convention of the
American Bankers' Association, as finally
approved does not vary much from the
original blan. In addition to the Cali
fornia Theater three rooms at the Palace
Hotel have been engaged ror the accom
modation of the bankers.
These rooms will be used as general
headquarters for the visitors. The rooms
will be handsomely decorated under the
direction of the decoration committee.
The first proceedings of formal nature
will take place on October 20, when the
trust company section will meet in the
California Theater and the savings banK
section will assemble in the hall of the
Academy of Sciences building. The first
session of the American Bankers' Asso
ciation will be held on October 21 at the
California Theater and there will be a
forenoon session each day until Friday.
October 23, inclusive of the last date.
The addresses of welcome will be by
Mayor Sehmitz. Governor Pardee and ex-
Mayor Phelan. Right Rev. Bishop Nich
ols Rev. George C. Adams and Rev. Brad
ford I^eavltt will upon the several day*
of the Besslon Invoke blessings upon the

As the sun sinks in the west thia even
ins devout Hebrews will begin a twenty
lour hours' fast and spend most of the
time in prayer. "Yom Klppur," or the
Day of Atonement as it is called, starts
at sundown and ends on Thursday even
ing at 6 o'clock. Thi3 is the- most im
portant event in the Jewish calendar and
is religiously kept by all who profess
that religion. Stores will be closed and
the synagogues will be crowded with wor
shipers." '
According to the Hebrew calendar, the
holiday falls on the 10th day ot -Tlsh
ree " This evening the services ir. the
synagogues will be extremely solemn.
Sermons will be preached by the rabbis
on themes that befit the occasion. Spe
cial prayers will be recited and the music
which is a part of the service will be
rendered by augmented choirs. Thf tex<
vice of "kol Nidre" beKlns the observ
ance of the atonement day.
This da; r is observed by the jews who
are desirous of making their peace with
God and to become reconciled with men.
It is also a day set aside for self-exami
nation. Confessions are made to Go<i ar.d
the worshiper prays for forgiveness f r
whatever sins he may have committed
during the past year. It is an occas!.,;i
for reconciliation with all people as WtO.
The Jew knows he cannot secure for
giveness from God unless he has mad*
amends for whatever wrongs he rr.^y
have committed.
The rabbis and cantors dress in white
and the congregation remains in the ten
pie all day until the services ar e endcl.
On Thursday there will be four services.
The mornimr service is called "Shacha
ris," which is followed by "Musaph." or
additional service. In the afternoon thÂ»
service ia called "Mlncha," and the clos
ing service of the day is "Neela." Prob
ably the most important and most im
pressive service of all is near the cIom
of this important holiday. The congr*
gation, led by the cantor, recites thi
prayers which a Jew is supposed to say
before he dies. This is donÂ© in order
that if a Jew should becoma unconscious
before death he shall have made hU
peace with God. This is followed by the
"Schmah." or confession, in the belief in
the unity of God. Then the congregation
repeats three times the phrase, "Blessffi
be his name forever and ever." The
words "The Lord, he is God." are then
repeated three times, which ic the
phrase used by the Israelites on Mount
Carmel when Elijah reformed the Jews
to worshio God Instead of Baal.
Rabbi Isidore Myers of Congregation
Ohabai Shalome -will deliver a sermon
this evening: on the "Vital Questions of
the Day." and to-morrow at noon he will
speak on the subject of "Reformation."
The services at the Temple Emanu-El
this evening will be very impressive.
Rabbi Jacob Voorsaneer will preach a
special sermon and the choir, augmented
by an orchestra, will render special music.
In addition to the superior personal qualifica
tions which Mr. Crocker has when compared with
his opponents, there is another advantage on his
side which should not be overlooked by any voter
who has a sincere regard for the welfare of the
city. Mr. Crocker is backed by a well-ordered and
harmonious party. There are no factions contend
ing around him for control of the offices or for
participation in what they look upon as the spoils
of office. He was nominated by a convention that
was genuinely representative of the rank and file
of the Republican party, and he stands therefore
as the representative of the party as a whole,
pledged to nothing beyond the welfare of the city
as expressed in the Republican platform. No boss
had anything to do with nominating him. He was
the choice of no faction. He was opposed by no
faction. He enters the campaign free and un
trammeled, and he will enter office with an equal
freedom.
Contrast that showing of the forces back of Mr.
Crocker with those that are not only back of the
opposing candidates but are in front of them and
on all sides of them at the same time, and it will
be seen that the political advantages possessed by
Mr. Crocker are pf themselves sufficient to win for
him the support of independent voters. He will
never be called upon to distribute loaves and fishes
for the feeding of hungry factions. He will- be
able to give the city a strictly business adminis
tration, and can be counted on to do so. He is
therefore entitled to the votes of independents as
well as to those of his own party. In fact, the
vote on the bond proposals gives reason for be
lieving he will receive many votes from men who
in the last municipal election voted for the Demo
cratic ticket or for the labor ticket. The demand
is for a business administration, and that being
so Henry J. Crocker is clearly the man whom the
civic patriotism and common sense of his fellow
citizens will call to direct the municipal adminis
tration for the ensuing term.
Mr. Crocker has had the training which tends di
rectly to fit a man for fulfilling the functions
of the Mayor of a city like San Francisco.
He has been the directing head of business en
terprises of large extent and has been uniformly
successful in his management of them. He un
derstands finance and administrative work thor
oughly. He has been doing that kind of work
with conspicuous success for many years. He will
carry to the office a judgment ripened by the actual
performance of work not essentially dissimilar to that
which the Mayoralty will entail, and consequently
from the very start he will be ready to perform with
sagacity and promptness every duty that arises,
whether in the ordinary routine of the office or from
some question of the bond issues. :
Without any disparagement to the personal and
political merits of the two candidates in opposition, it
can be said that neither of them is known as a man of
business. Neither has ever shown any capacity as a
financier or as an executive officer. Neither has had
experience in the practical management of a large
business of any kind. Neither of them, therefore, is
in any way equipped for the efficient performance of
the work which in addition to the ordinary duties of
a Mayor is to be imposed upon the chief executive of
the incoming administration.
BY the vote upon the various bond proposals, it
is made evident that the people of San Fran
cisco demand at this time a progressive ad
ministration with a good business man in the office
of Mayor. To vote for a large bonded debt for the
purpose of obtaining money for public works without
accompanying the vote with a resolve to elect none
but thoroughly competent men to office, and above
all to elect an experienced and efficient man of affairs
to manage and direct the business of the city, would
be a folly of which the voters of San Francisco are
hardly to be suspected. We take it, therefore, that
the vote on the bond issues signifies a movement
which to a large extent will override party lines and
will carry a big majority of the voters to the side of
Mr. Crocker and his colleagues on the Republican
ticket.

steam yachts could be named aggregating a value of

One report says that a New York man "prominent

it cost him $5000 a day to live aside from his yacht

exaggeration, but the very telling of the story shows
to what extent extravagance has been carried in the

Dickens museum would probably be es

EERLIX, Sept. 23.â Prince Henry of
Prussia is personally superintending tha
experiments with the submarine boat

Lord Milner's reluctance to accept of

to c hesitancy to commit himself as a par

LONDON, Sept. 30.â A prolongation of
the Ministerial crisis seems likely, judg
ing from newspaper comment, to still fur
ther discredit the Government. It has
been taken for granted that Premier Bal
four would complete the reconstruction
of the Cabinet before going to Sheffield to
deliver his long-expected speech explain
ing his fiscal policy, which is due on Oc
tober 1. It is now seen that this 1b Im
possible and the apparent waiting for
Lord Mllner's decision Is commented on in
Conservative as well as Liberal papers as
emphasizing '_ the dearth of first-class
statesmen in the Conservative ranks. A
large section , of the Unionist party Is
restless under' the report that ,Balfour is
supporting Brodrick in the latter's deter
mination to remain at the War Office.
The Second Grenadiers Is the regiment
in which occurred the case of the four
privates who were recently sentenced, one
of them to ten years' imprisonment and
the others from six to three years* impris
onment, for assaulting a sergeant named
Peters, which severity was contrasted by
the Socialist Vorwaerts with the light
sentence (two years' incarceration in a
fortress) imposed on Naval Ensign Huess
ner for killing his friend, an artillery
man for not saluting him properly. The
army authorities hold the Socialist suc
cesses at the recent elections to be par
tially responsible for the discontent among
the soldiers, who gathered at Heidelberg
after the announcement of the verdict In
the Peters case and uttered threats
against their officers.
The Vorwaerts, which almost every day
attacks the behavior of officers and non
commissioned officers, to-day cites 159 ver
dicts in cases of brutality for which non
commissioned officers were punished with
an aggregate of fifty years and nine
months' imprisonment and eighty verdidts
BERLIN, Sept. 29.-A crowd of private

MANILA, Sept) 29.â Judge Sweeny,
in sentencing Domlnador Gomez, recited
the -fact that out of some $40,000 collected
by the Union Obrero, only $14,000 had
been accounted for by Gomez. In addi
tion to this he had sold stock in the
concern, knowing very well that the union
was insolvent. The real object of the
conspirators, he said, was the overthrow
of the Government and to assist the la
drones in their raids in the northern prov
inces. The Filipino assessors, in dissent

that a faulty j translation of the Incrim

Jim Morley and his southern stick
wielders performed on the Oakland rlÂ«U
yesterday for the first time in many
moons and they celebrated the Ilttla
event by landing on the ball for fourteen
hits that came so quickly that they wen*
hard to keep track of. Uncle Henrys
dead ones were the victims, and ere the
weary nine rounds came to an end thti
Angels made seven runs and the natives
never had a look in.
Little Lindsey was sent out on the slab
to puzzle the league- leaders and he was
an awful easy proposition. The Angela
began to open up on the tiny southpaw
during the fourth inning. From that
time on they accumulated runs as fast as
they pleased and the natives were power
less to stop the procession over the plate.
Dolly Gray had a good day on the slab
âthe first that he has experienced for a
long time. At that, the home players
managed to cop nine hits off his offerings,
but somehow or other they never came at
the right time, and the six bases on balls
which the big southpaw issued were, for
tunately for him, well scattered along tha
route of battle.
Llndsey was taken out Â»of the box In
the middle of the eighth inning and Horl
son took his p^ace. In making a throw to
third base the former gave his arm a se
,'vere wrench. It pained him so that he
was unable to continue. Lindsey had tha
injured member examined by a physician
when he arrived in this city. The doctor
says that the wrench is a severe one ami
the little southpaw will probably not bo
seen in action again this season.
The game was loosely played and waa
devoid of any special interest. Dillon wa3
back at first base for Los Angeles after
an absence of nearly a month, lie showed
his usual flpe form in fielding and landed
on the sphere for two solid hits. The
score: â¢

THE SANl FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1903.
Continued on Page 13, Column 5.
The fight was extremely Interesting to
the spectators. As each round terminated
the excited onlookers settled back for a
breathing spell and again would be
thrown into a fever heat by the manner
in which the pair hammered each other.
Following is a good description of -the
fight by rounds as noted by. an expert:
Round 1 â Hanlon sent in* a right to body
Description of the Battle as Viewed
by an Expert at the Game.
FIGHT BY ROUNDS.
With all the desperate fighting there
was but little blood spilled. Hanlon'a nose
was cut and bled slightly. His' leit' eye
was blackened. Yanger's lips and nose
were puffed up from the frequent visita
tions of Hanlon's gloves.
Hanlon seemed the fresher and stur
dier of the two boxers, the years- of
training Yanger has undergone having
undoubtedly taken some of the dash out
of him. His blows lacked the sting which
hurts. He landed repeatedly on Hanlon,
but the latter only shook his head and
rushed in for more. He took blows re
peatedly with thÂ« Idea of giving harder
ones in return and seldom missed. He
kept boring in all the time and never at
tempted to hang on. He left all this to
Yanger, at no time during the fight feel
ing himself In danger. He fought more
openly than on previous occasions, at
times abandoning 1> ( 8 crouching attitude
entirely.
After the fight Yanger admitted he had
a close call in the fifteenth round. Man
ager Hertz said he would like to match
Yanger with Hanlon again to fight in the
East.
Billy Jordan Introduced Yanger as the
"Tipton Slasher" of Chicago. Hanlon
was announced as the pride of California.
Charles Selger and Jimmy Brltt were also
introduced. A telegram was read from
Young Corbett offering: to fight the win
ner.
Yanger and Hanlon entered the ring to
gether. The former was attended by
Manager Hertz, Alexander Greggains,
Billy Otts. Billy Roach and Charles
Selger, With Hanlon were Harry Foley,
Joe Angell, Fred Landers, Toby Irwln and
Mike Short.
THE BOXERS APPEAR.
A policeman had quite a struggle with
one man who climbed between the ropes.
In putting him out the ; man's pistol
pocket was exposed and the law'f% de
fender saw a shining object there. A
look of determination spread over his face
as he took a firmer hold of the man and
proceeded to disarm him. The deadly
weapon was secured and, much to the
chagrin of the patrolman and the amuse
ment of the spectators, proved to be a
small whisky flaskâ and empty. No ar
rests.
Referee Smith placed his hand on Han
lon's shoulder and declared him .the vic
tor. The Californian rtvas cheered and
cheered until the rafters re-echoed with
the applause. A rush was made for the
ring by Hanlon's admirera, But a cordon
cf police hustled them outside the rbpes.
The twentieth round was almost a repe
tition of the fifteenth. Hanlon was again
the aggressor and had Yanger on the
verge of going out. Yanger took an in
credible amount of punishment, but lasted
to the end.
The remaining rounds up to the twen
tieth seemed tame in comparison with
the fifteenth. Yanger came back fighting
and put up a bold front, although it was
seen he was tender about the body and
winced whenever a blow landed there.
Hanlon's timekeeper claimed the gong
was sounded before the time was really
up. In his dressing room after the fight
Hanlon claimed that when Referee Smith
broke them out of the clinches he invari
ably stood in the way. Hanlon said he
had to run around him In order to reach
Yanger. This gave the latter additional
respite.
h~-^DDIE HANLON gained a brll-
liant victory over the hitherto
undefeated featherweight boxer,
Bonny Yanger, last night In Me
chanics' Pavilion. The fight went
twenty rounds and for dramatic incident
and quickness of action has seldom been
equaled In this or any other city.
By some peculiar intuition the specta
tors scented a fierce contest in the fif
teenth round. They were not disap
pointed, as it proved the most thrilling
round ever seen here. It had hardly got
well under way when Yanger was
knocked down with a clean right to the
head, lie was dazed but up before the
count and then for nearly three minutes
a remarkable struggle ensued. The spec
tators were all on their feet and fairly
surged about the ring, their tense faces
glistening in the glare of the powerful
electric lights.
Yanger was dazed and groggy, but his
gameness kept him on his feet and aided
him in withstanding the relentless little
fighter, who followed him all over the
ring, raining blows on him. It was this
method of aitack which lost Hanlon a
clean-cut victory at this point. Had he
concentrated all his strength into one blow
Yanger would surely have succumbed.
At that Hanlon seemed the coolest man
In the house. He kept peppering away
at Yanger, who hung on at every oppor
tunity. The Chicago man was stagger
ing about helplessly when the end of the
round brought him temporary relief.

hook to the Jaw. Yanger crossed with left to
the face and they clinched. Both exchanged
hard rights to the body and Yanger sent a hard
left to the jaw, for which he was countered
with right and left on the jaw. Yanger got
his right to the body and the bell rang with
the men engaged In a hot rally, from which
Hanlon emerged second best. Yanger showed
improvement In this round and had the better
of the argument.
BOTH FIGHT FIERCELY.
Round 9 â As usual they went to a clinch.
They mixed it at the ropes and Eddie landed
lightly with left on the face and Yanger put
right and left to the face. Hanlon put right
to the body and blocked several counters. Yan
ger drove a right to the ribs and Just grazed
Har.lon'n head with right for the Jaw. Han
lon appears to be the fresher of the two. In
a fierce rally Kddle put half a dozen' rights and
lefts to the body and a hard right to the jaw.
Yanger fought back fiercely, however, and
landed some good ones on the body and face.
Hanlon waded right in, determined to give
Yanger no rest, but did not succeed in landing.
Just previous to the bell they mixed It in the
center of the ring, with Hanlon having the
advantage. This was Hanlon's round.
HANSON LANDS OFTEN.
In return. , ; They fought I.ito a clinch and
then ; Yanger missed hard right uppercut for
the jaw. Hanlon drove his right hard on the
kidneys and as the gong tolled put a hard
right to the ribs. Both men displayed great
cleverness and blocked and ducked cleverly.

No person by the name of Stoddard or
Williamson Is known at the Harmony
Hotel, Brannan street.
Stoddard's sister has now told Geary
that her brother says that he was drunk
and remembers nothing about it. She also
says that Elizabeth Williamson has a
husband, who Is not divorced. They gave
their address as the Harmony Hotel, TZi
Brannan street, San Francisco.
Stoddard and Elizabejh Williamson
were married by Justice of the Peace
Geary on the 22d of this month at the
County Clerk's office. The groom was
melancholy and talked suicide. When
the ceremony was over he threatened to
end the whole affair by taking his own
life. When they applied for a license he
wanted to give the name of "Starten."
The bride-to-be objected to this and said
that she would not go on with the cere
mony 'unless it was done properly. He
then gave his right name.
Although they had asked to have a
Justice of the Peace summoned after the
license had been Issued, Stoddard changed
and wanted a minister to perform the
ceremony. She wanted the matter over
with as quickly as possible and finally
Geary refused to take any part In the
affair, as he said It looked too much Hko
coercion. They both then urged him to
do his part and were duly married.
According to a statement made to Jus
tice of the Peace Geary by a stater ot
Frank Stoddaxd. who was an unhappy
groom In a ceremony performed by tha
Judge a week ago, Elizabeth Williamson,
the bride, was already a married woman
and the role she played In the contract
was that of a bigamist- The Judge haa
been Interviewed by Stoddards sister with
a view toward finding out her brother's
status in the case.

this time the rivalry had become pretty
keen and a good deal depended on which
play eot to London first, so "The First
Born" and "The Cat and the Cherub"
had a 3000-mile race across the Atlantic.
It was an excitinc trial of speed, with
the whole theatrical population looking
on. But "The Cat and the Cherub" sight

audience an hour after its arrival while
"The First Born" was still struggling
with seasickness and the waves.
*' 'The Cat and the Cherub' stayed a
month at the Lyric Theater," said Mr.
Fernald in retelling the story of that ex
citing time. " 'The First Born' only stay
ed a week. I always think of that with
satisfaction.. The plays haven't been re
vived, for the simple rpason that audi
ences outside of California don't under
stand them. Everybody knows that."
Having lived some of his life in Japan,
Mr. Fernald felt equal to the task of
writing a Japanese drama, and so he
turned out "The Moonlight Blossom."
Miss Eleanor Calhoun, a talented Califor
nia girl who has since become a protege
of Mrs. Patrick Campbell, was the lead
ing lady in this play. She was coached
by the Japanese wife of Sir Edwin Ar
nold the poet. The play was In three
acts,' and at first was very successful,
but the ignorance of Londoners, or rathen
The inspiration for this metropolitan
campaign came from a promise of suc

and the Cherub," that Mr. Fernald wrote.
The play was the dramatization cf Mr.

time al! Ca'iforr.ia was talking about

FernaM. "He has become one of^the best

is to present 'Mine. Sans Gene," which
has haw set to music, and Blinn has
been chosen to play Napoleon, the only

great success.

OAKLAND, Sept. 29.â The proposition
to bond the city in orj3er to obtain funds
for the purpose of repaving Telegraph
avenue is not looked upon with favor by
Mayor Olney, who holds that it would be
unjust to make the proposed Improve
ment a tax on the entire city, when the
property along the avenue is constantly
Increasing in value and the property own
ers would reap nearly all the benefit.
Regarding the contention of the prop
erty owners that the city, having accept
ed the street, was obliged to keep tt In
repair, the Mayor said that so far as he
had been able to learn, neither Telegraph
nor San Pablo avenues had ever been ac
cepted by the city.
In speaking of the proposed bond issue
Mayor Olney said:
I am satiafled that the citizens of this city
will never vote for bonds to pave one or even
three streets when they consider that the pave
ment will be worn out long before the bonds
become due. The average life of a pavement
Is . not more than fifteen years, and the pro
posed bonds run for forty years.
There is another reason why the property
owners will not vote for bonds to repave Tele
graph and San Pablo avenues, and that is that
property on those thoroughfares is rapidly in
creasing In value, and the owners of this prop
erty should pay for the Improvement, rather
than ask that the expense be shared by peo
ple In other parts of the city, where the In
crease In value Is less rapid.
' If the property owners on the avenue will
put in a substantial pavement and plant trees
to the Berkeley line, they will enhance the
value of the property ten-fold. They are only
Injuring themeelves by delaying these Improve
ments. ' .

Mr. Lancaster is a native of Nevada,
coming to Oakland with his mother, Mrs.
E. L. Lancaster, about a year ago, since
which time he has been in the employ
of the Pierce Hardware Company. He
is a brother of William J. Lancaster, who
was married on the 8th inst. to Miss
Emma Orton.
blossoms held the veil In place and a
shower of white roses formed the bridal
bouquet.
The nuptial knot was tied by Professor
S. B. Randall of the California Baptist
College, an old friend of the bride and
her family.
A small reception at the home of the
bride's mother, Mrs. A. A. Bouterioua,
followed the church ceremony, about 100
guests having been invited to the house.
The decorations at the residence were
very artistic, the graceful bower of ferns
and pink lilies where the newly married
couple stood while receiving congratula
tions being particularly attractive.
Mr. and Mrs. Lancaster expect to re
main away on their wedding trip about
two weeks, after which they will reside
in Oakland. The bride is prominent in
musical circles, being a graduate of. the
department of " music at California Col
lege. She is both a vocalist and a pian
ist and has been for some time a mem
ber of the First Baptist Church choir.

CITIZENS WANT
TO INCORPORATE
Professor Ritter is to be the scientific
director of the institute. In explaining
the ne.eds of such an institute to the
people he said that the southern coast
is rich in marine life and a good field
for exploration. He urged the founding
of an institute that would prosecute its
researches continuously through salaried
investigators, like the astronomers, not
by individuals who come and go at will
and work according to their resources.
The members of the San D!ego associa
tion are all men of means and they are
expected to subscribe a fund large enough,
to bear Interest of $10,000 a year, which
amount it is estimated the institute will
cost annually. The officers of the asso
ciation are: President. Homer H. Peters;
vice president. Miss Ellen Scripps; scien
tific director. Professor W. E. Ritter: sec
retary. Dr. Fred Baker; treasurer. Julius
Wangenheim; directors, E. W. Scripps
and James Macllullen.
After the institute is founded and suffi
ciently endowed H will be transferred to
the University of California, so that it
may become a department of the univer
sity, co-ordinate with its already exist
ing departments.
The University of California is about
to receive a valuable gift from the citi
zens of San Diego, a marine biological
laboratory, fully equipped and endowed
with sufficient funds to keep a corps of
scientists at work all the time.
The determination of the San Diegans
to found such an institution Is the direct
result of the work of Professor W. E.
Rltter. the university zoologist, who spent
last summer on San Diego Bay and con
ducted the Hummer school there, the ex
penses of the enterprise being footed by
the people of San Diego. Now comes the
demand for a larger and permanent In
stitution from the Son Diegans them
selves, who are so interested In scientific
research that they are willing to sub
scribe tho money for the purpose of
founding it.
The San Diegans recently formed an
organization to be known as the Marine
Biological Association. Its purpose is
stated to found and endow the San
Diego Marine Biological Institution, the
objects of which, according to the pre
amble to the by-laws, will consist in
"carrying on a biological and hydro
graphic survey of the waters of the Pa
cific Ocean adjacent to the coast of
Southern California, to build and main
tain a public aquarium and museum and
to prosecute such other kindred" under
takings as may be deemed wise."

when off the river Platte. a terrific gale sprung
up which was almost a hurricane in Its vio
lence. It struck the ship with tremendous
fury and threw her about like a cockel shell,
tearing away the lower main topsail yards,
which fell with a great crash to the decks.
From July 12 to August 1 she experienced
a saccesslon of southwest gales and terrific
storms, accompanied by snow and lee, which
caused her to shift her carsro. Forty feet of
her starboard bulwarks were carrltd away,
her forward stanchions were smashed, one of
her boats was washed overboard, several of
her sails were blown away and finally. In the
height of the hurricane, she started her
decks. After the fury of the storm abated
she proceeded on her way and came to anchor
without further mishap. She brlr.RÂ» a careo

the scene of the wreck thin morning and
the wrecking crew will commence Its la

The ship is safe a* lorg as the calm

our own market on the down grade, reflecting
the Eame condition of overeitension uf capital
in certain lines, causing the.,iere:-*ity for dras
tic liquidation elsewhere; tbe opening tone here
was decidedly unsettled. Ihe United States
Steel stocks made a furthei break, the com
mon -and preferred breakinf through yestci
day'fe new record. The majority of ..opening
.cbasgHS waa on the side of.tuchnes and there
was eome special pressure arainst New York
Central. Yesterday's break in Pennsylvania
having brought that 0 per cei t stock down to
a parity with the 5 per cent New â¢\u25a0 York Cen
tral, the usual bear pressure under these cir
cumstances developed against Uie latter. Hut
Pennsylvania's o;>ening rise of a point was the
proclamation that ether influences were at
work. The buying of this stock was traceable
to the banking house of Kuhn. Loeb & Co...
which manage* the company's f.nancial opera
tions. The very heavy buying oriers in United
States Steel preferred were credited In a sim
ilar way to J. P. ilorgan & Co.. and it was
confidently affirmed that the op.'n buying of
Amalgamated Copper .by brokers usually em
ployed by the Standard Oil pary might be
accepted in good faith as indicatirg the acti\-
Ity on the buying side' of that ptrty. There
has been an almost euperstitirus feeling
among the whole ' speculative contingent that
the melting away of prices, which had reached'
the point of a slow panic, would not be checked
until these financial leaders be^.m to buy,
stocks largely and in concert. Conviction that
this would happen. had an electrical effect upon
speculative eentiment and drove the bears to
cover with a scramble. Some of the large bear
speculators put out fresh short lines at differ
ent stages of-;- the- advance in the confidence,
that Uie large'*buying orders were designed
simply to support the market, to bt resoid
upon any considerable advance. But thtre was
no evidence of, this reselling and the belief
gained ground that the great banking inter
ests had definitely changed their recent policy
cf abandoning- the market- to Its own resources
and biding the time when the fever of selling,
which has taken hold of the security-holding
public, should exhaust Itself. ! ' It was evident
at the Bame time that the urgent liquidation
lacked the force which carrlejl down prices in
recent markets.' ' As a result there was a
marked revival of confidence and dissipation
of many of the shadowy fears which have in
fected the speculative mind of late with even
greater effect than actual developments. The
news of the day, of which there was little
bearing on values, wag not a factor at all in
the movement of prices.
The bond market became firm, in sympathy
with the recovery in stocks. Total sales, par
value, $4.flsO.CCO.
United States 2s declined. *4 on the last call.

WOMAN SURPRISES TWO

When questioned * last evening Abble
Hassell stuck to her story that she had
been bound and gagged and that an at
tempt had been made to kill her by means
of illuminating gas.
She acain admitted that she had lied
when she had accused her former hus
band of an attempt on her life, and from
tfie many conflicting statements made by
the woman ; there is little doubt that
she has sought notoriety and that the
ScnsatJÂ«nal story she told in the first In
sfance was bat a fabrication. The police
officials will not waste arty more time on
the woman's claim that an attempt was
made to, kill her, as they are satfsfied that
her story has- absolutely no foundation.
The police believe that the gas was not
turned on, as Dr. Quigley, who attended
the woman, said she showed no- signs of
gas asphyxiation and nobody could be
found to say positively, that they smelled
gas in the woman's bedroom. They are
even inclined to think that the whole af
fair was put up by the woman herself to
get Mondragon into trouble.

the gas. The chief advised her to go

her mind to tell him the truth and she

â¢ Agent Hazen worked steadily on the
case and secured a lot of evidence, which
convinced the Jury of guilt of the ac
cused men after beln? out just fifteen
minutes. While working on the case Haz
en ran across a cache of counterfeit
coins on a deserted ranch. Upon inves
tigation it was learned that the bogus
money had been buried there several
years ago by .two Italians, who are now
doing time - for counterfeiting.
United States Secret ! Service Agent
George. W. Hazen returned last night from
Los Angeles, where he had been for more
than two weeks past engaged In secur
ing evidence against two counterfeiters,
Emlle Bruder and Clement Duschense.
The men were tried by Judge Wellborn in
the United States District Court, found
guilty of counterfeiting and sentenced to
five years' each in San Quentln.
Both counterfeiters are Frenchmen and
they operated in a small canyon outside
the city limits of Los Angeles. They
were engaged in making 50-cent pieces
and were finally taken into custody, after
a hard battle, in which several shots
were fired. Shortly before the case came
to trial, Bruder fell heir to $4500 by the
death of a relative in France, so the best
legal talent was secured to defend the
pair. Â«

One peculiar feature about the bank
taking the Initiative in the matter is that
under the new rate banking poncerns and
holders of mortgages would have to pay
some $75,000 less in taxes because the
State raise does not- affect mortgages,
moneys or solvent credits. .Nevertheless,
the city rate of $1,076, based on the as
sessment roll of $420,000,000, is regarded
to b< the only legal rate. It is expected
that tne, Supreme Court will give an early
decision on the point involved. ,.;
The Injunction -will result in stopping
the work of carrying out the taxes on
the roll by the Auditor, who will prob
ably be compelled to ask for an extension
of time from the .second. Monday in Oc
tober, when he is required to turn the
books over to the Tax Collector.
The bank declares that the legal course
that should be followed is to. figure the
taxes for municipal purposes nt $1,076,
the rate adopted last June" by the Board
ot Supervisors based on the assessment
valuation of $422,000,000, as returned by
Assessor. Dodge."
The State tax rate of 56.1 cents on
every $100 of assessed valuation, the bank
claims, should be calculated on the assess
ment roll of $340,000,000, as fixed by, the
State Board of Equalization. .
It is said that the mortgages held by
the bank will be invalidated in the event
that the new city tax rate of 84.4 cents is
figured, Instead of the. old rate. of $1,076
as fixed by the Board of Supervisors last
June, according to charter requirements.
Verbal notification was received yester
day in the Tax Collector's and Auditor's
offices that the Hibernia Bank will to
day bring mandamus proceedings In the
Supreme ' Court, to enjoin Auditor Baehr
from carrying out - on the assessment
books the new tax rate of 84.4 cents for
city purposes,' based on the increased val
uation of $540,000,000 as fixed by the State
Board of Equalization. The papers in
the case have already been prepared by
the attorneys of the bank.
The mandamus proceedings will be sup
plemented by a petition of the banking
corporation that 'Auditor Baehr be cited
to show cause why he should not carry
out two valuations on the roll instead of
one.
