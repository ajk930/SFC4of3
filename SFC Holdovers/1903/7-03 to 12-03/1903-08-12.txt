MAKE STRONG DEMANDS.
After setting forth the fact that none
of the territory sought for incorporation,
is at present under municipal govern

lowing territory be turned over to the
municipality to be known as the town of
Colma: ',' r ; '
. Beginning at a point on the northern

>Â»GANG of pothouse , politicians.
Â£Jk0 blacklegs and gamblers have
JBjf launched a scheme whereby the
"^ â¢ town of Colma Is to be made
a plague spot of vice and the
silent cities of the dead in its vicinity
are to be defiled by. the presence of open
gambling hells and poolrooms aX their,
very gates. '\ 'Â¦'Â¦ ,â¢/>-Â¦â¢ 'Â¦Â¦'â¢
Not only do the gamblers plot to estab
lish their unsavory nests within a stone's
throw of the cemetery gates but under
the pretext of legitimate taxation for the
support of good municipal government
they have designed that the cemeteries
with their : countless habitations of the
dead shall pay the dole by w^ilch the
depravity of the living may be pandered
to. All of this is cunningly disguised
under the petition for the Incorporation
of the town of Colma as a city of the
sixth class, which is now in the hands of
the Supervisors of San Mateo County.
But in their zeal to accomplish their
purposes under the hollow sanction . of
the law the conspirators have revealed
their purposes by their very "acts. In
order that the town of Colma may sup
port a municipal sovernment the gam
blers have found It necessary to incor
porate in their demand a territory twelve
miles square, almost the area of San
Francisco. From the present site of Col
ma they have asked that the extent of
the incorporated city embrace a district
extending up to the southern boundary
ct San Francisco CÂ«unty and west to the
sand wastes of the ocean. The taxes
from this vast tract of territory, added
to the blood money which would be ex
torted from nine cemeteries, would be
sufficient to maintain a municipal govern
ment, and thus give sanction. to the main
tenance of the gambling resorts.
BACKEB BY GAMBLERS.
' s But the five Supervisors to a man ad
mit that the scheme for the incorporation
of Colma Is the wcrk of San Francisco
gambTers, T working under the cover "of
agents In San Mateo County. They ac
knowledge that the incorporation of Col
ma will, be the signal for a rush of the
riffraff of San Francisco to the very gates
of the sacred places of the dead. They
have not the power to refuse a petition
signed by fifty bona fide taxpayers of the
district, but the option lies with them
to curtail the territory, demanded by the
petitioners. It now remains for the Su
pervisors of San Mateo County to so far
reduce the enormous area sought as to
render the support of a municipal gov
ernment out of thÂ« question.
It is known that the gamblers have
been at work on their scheme for some
time. Several months ago Superintendent
E. B. McPherson of the Cypress Lawn
Cemetery was approached with the offer
of political-preferment if he would launch
the Incorporation movement. Â¦ He refused,
and, shortly after R. S. Thornton, J. T.
Casey and George C. Luce appeared as
champions of the cause. On July 6a
petition was handed in to the Board of
Supervisors demanding Incorporation. For
some unaccountable reason this was later
withdrawn and a second submitted at the
meeting of the board held on August 3. '
-When this second Instrument was placed
In the hands" of the SuDervIsors it bore
the names of sixty-three reputed taxpay
ers of. the district. H. W. Brown, an
attorney ' living In Colma, protested to
the; petition on the grounds that It con
tained thÂ« . names ; of several who were
not ; lesa I electors of the township. Act
ing on .his objection., the board referred
the matter. to' District Attorney J. J. Bul-
Afterward the widow was declared re
sponsible to thiSredltors of the company
for 100 cents on every dollars. Thus
while the company may be debarred from
recovering the balance of SO cents on
each share sold for 20 cents, the creditors
of the company are not so debarred, and
may appeal to the original purchasers
of the stock for. settlement.
Hundreds upon hundreds of oil mining
companies have been organized under the
laws of Arizona and most of these com
panies, especially those known as "wild
cat" corporations, have a'dvertlsed In
their prospectus that the stock was' not
assessable and If a share of stock of the
par value of 5100 is purchased for. two
bits or less, the purchaser'cannot be as
sessed '" for any â¢ purpose. This Judge
Trask holds is not good In law ahd that
the man : who . paid two bits for; a share
of stock is liable for $100 of the debts of
the company, and that the same is'true
of 'every share of stock which he may
have purchased. . ; . . .
The effect of .such a. ruling upon the
thousands of persons who during the' oil
boom several years ago purchased stock
by the hundreds of shares. If the decision
be : affirmed : by. the Supreme .Court. Is

"Fairbanks. Morse & Company

of the suit that gave rise to this deci
sion. According to the facts brought out
a widow bought 40,000 shares of the stock
for J2CO0 with the understanding that the
stock was rion-asscssable. The company
soon spent the 52000 In trying to locate
an oil well and then the Investor, becom
ing frightened at the possibility of being
called upon to aid the defunct.' concern,
disposed of her stock to a niece for a
consideration. This was before any. suit
was brought against the company by any
of Its creditors.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 11.â If a decision
rendered by Superior Judge Trask is sus
tained by the Supreme Court it will be
of great importance to thousands of peo
ple throughout the State and upon many
of them it may have a serious effect
financially. In a word, the decision is to
the effect that the stockholders of a cor
poration are liable for the debts of that
corporation to the full amount of the par
value of their stock regardless of whether
such corporation Is organized" under the
laws of any other State, and that while
the corporation itself may not be able
to compel the payment of the full value
of the stock, the creditors of such cor
poration may do so.

SEES THREE
CONVICTS IN
CHINATOWN
The scenes at the mouth of the tunnel
where the victims were brought forth
were of the most ! heart-rending descrip
tion â crowds of weeping men, women and
children struggling forward in an effort
to recognize their missing relatives and
friends. Most of the victims are from
the middle and working classes, as the
trains were^ carrying them home from
their woik. -Although the accident oc
curred at 8 o'clock last evening the offi
cials and firemen were unable to descend
into the tunnel this morning owing to the
blinding clouds of smoke from, the burn-
Ing train. Frequent attempts were' made
by heroic volunteers whom It was neces
sary to rescue, half^suffocatcd. "â¢:'
At ten minutes after 3 o'clock Sergeant
Ahrens, wearing a respirator, . succeeded
in making tho descent. He remained, sev
en minutes and brought the first Informa
tion to the effect that corpses were strewn
all about tho roadway in the tunnel.
Then he collapsed and was taken to : the
hospital. Twenty : minutes later firemen
forced their way down through the tunnel
station at Menllmontant and . returned
soon afterward with seven -bodiesâ three
m^n, two , young 'boys and two young
women. These persons had been asphyxi
ated as their positions showed they had
been groping their way through -the
smoke that filled -the" tunnel, -seeking a
way- to escape, .when they were overcome.
â¢ The work of bringing iip the bodies went
on steadily, after' that under the persona!
While the two trains were burning a
third train approached from Fere \ la
Chaise. The officials at Menilmontant
warned the driver of the danger and he
at once reversed direction and went back
as quickly as possible, thus escaping with
all of his passengers.
WILD RUSH OF PASSENGERS.
Meanwhile another train came up from
Bellvillo behind the burning trains and
stopped at Les Couronnes just as .uu
smoke began to -enter the station from the
tunnel. Then the catastrophe occurred."
On seeing the smoke the passengers jump
ed to the station platform and :uced in
the direction of Menilmontant, trying to
make their way to the staircase at the
end. 'They were driven back by the
smoke toward the other end of fhe plat
form, where there is a white brick wail.
There they crowded together and later
seventy-five bodies were found there in
a heap.
Deserted by the flight for safety this
fourth train also took fire and was con
sumed. Many of the 'rlghtened passen
gers, seeing escape cut off, huddled in tha
cars and probably were suffocated N by
smoke before the flames reached them.
SCENES AT TUNNEL'S MOUTH.
Suddenly, . as the first carriage was
drawing into Menllmontant station, a vio
lent explosion occurred. Blue flame arose
between the carriage containing the mo
tor and the next one. In a few minutes
the whole sixteen carriages were fa sheet
of fire. The officials jumped to tlie rails
ahd fled toward the station. They were
just in time, as the flames had -already
reached the roof and walls of the tunnel.
Electric wires were fizzling and the tun
nel, except for the flames of the burning
vehicles, was in darkness.
Thick smoke began to enter Menilmon
tant station and also to roll toward Lea
Couronnes.
IGNORES THE WARNING.
The stationmaster at Lee Couronnes no
ticed small jets of flame arising from be
neath the carriages and catching the bot
toms of the. cars. He shouted to the
driver:
"Stop! You will not-ha\*e time to reach
ydTmJesttnaticm.-*^â â¢-Â¦/?.Â»Â¦ ?' _; >
"We shall get there all right," answered
the motorman.
The two trains then proceeded into the
tunnel, the officials shutting the doors.

the platforms. As many persons were in
cinerated in the burning cars, it is proba

found to have been far in excess of one
hundred.
This is' how the catastrophe .occurred:

PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 11.â Sensational
Wall street news came to Philadelphia
by wire* after the close of the market to
day. It accounts for the strength of
Reading. The message came from the
usually reliable house of Moore & Schley
to its Philadelphia correspondents.
The message said it wa3 reported in
Wall street that the Delaware and Hud
son Company and the Delaware," Lacka
wanna and Western Railroad Company
would guarantee a dividend of 4 per cent
en Reading common.
Ah arrangement of this sort would very
nearly complete an effectual community
of interest among the anthracite produc
ers and carriers. The report that thÂ«
Reading will be leased indicates that J.
Pierpont Morgan may be about to con
summate his plans for a close union of
coal Interests. One reason for his delay
probably has been a desire to establish
the Reading's earning capacity to the sat
isfaction of the lessors.
The earnings are now eminently satis
factory. The Reading is paying a full
dividend of 4 per cent on first preferred
and Is believed to be able to pay the full
rate (4 per cent) on second- preferred also,
while it Is earning a handsome sum for
the common. It Is well known that the
Pennsylvania Railroad, through the Bal
timore and Ohio, and/the New York Cen
tral, through the Lake Shore, own large
amounts of Reading first and second pre-"
ferred stocks. Hence It would be im
possible for the lease of the Reading to be
made unless it met the approval of both
the Pennsylvania and the Central man
agements.
Both William Rockefeller and John D.
Rockefeller Jr. are directors of the Lack
awanna and these men are Gould's allies.
This proposed lease may be the first sign
of truce between the Pennsylvania and
Gould factions. It will be the first open
step whereby Gould's friends acquire an
interest In the Reading and the prospec
tive results have great possibilities, if it
develops that the Pennsylvania is to per

OVETER BAT, I* I., Aug. 11.â Elihu
t Koot will resign as Secretary of War, the
resignation to take effect about the first
of next January. He will be succeeded
by Judge William H. Taft. now Gover
nor of the Philippines.
For a long time Secretary Root has de
cired, for pressing private reasons, to re
tire frcm the Cabinet. When Mr. Roose
velt became President, Secretary Root in
dicated his wish to leave the Cabinet
within a year, but his friendship for the
President and his interest in pending
questions before the War Department
caused him to remain for a longer period
than he had intended. Even now he has
rot Indicated to the President Just when
he may leave the Cabinet, but he and the
President have discussed the subject
many times and have a mutual under
standing regarding it.
It is expected that the Secretary will
not present his resignation to the Presi
dent before he leaves for England to take
up the work of the Alaskan boundary
commission. He has not presented his
resignation yet and has not informed the
President when he will present it. It can
be said that the President expects that
the country will have the benefit of Roofs
serxices for several months, certainly un
til the beginning of the next year.
That Governor Taft will be Root's suc
cessor as Secretary of War there can be
no doubt. He Is familiar with many of
the problems which the Secretary of War
v.-M have to meet and solve; he is a warm
personal friend of the President, who has
an abiding confidence in his ability and
patriotism, and it is understood that he
would welcome the change Involved.
Of course, his appointment as Secretary
of War would necessitate the appoint
ment of a new president of the Philippine
Commission. In all probability General
Luke Wright would succeed to the pres
idency of the commission, his work as a
member of the body having been eminent
ly satisfactory to the administration.
Home other changes would be involved in
the appointment of Governor Taft as Sec
retary cf^War, but nothing definite con
cerning them can be taid at this time.

PASADENA, Aug. 11.â W. L. Jones, a
barber of this city, is quite positive that
CoBvict Fred Howard, the Folsom prison
escape, was shaved in his shop yester
day about noontime. He recognised the
man from photographs he had seen in
the papers and from descriptions. Two
men came into the shop, one of them, the
suspect, having about two weeks' growth
of beard. The other sat down and seemed
to be reading a paper, , but, kept a fur
tive watch. on the door. Both men were
shabbily dressed and covered with dust.
The employes in the shop began talking
about the escape of â¢ the convicts, but
the strangers made no comment until ad
dressed. One of them then>emarked that
he guessed the fugitives would eventually
be caught and hung. The man in the
chair left with his companion as soon as
he was shaved, and Jones, after instruct
ing one of his employes to keep watch
of the pair, hunted up a policeman. But
neither of the strangers could be relo
cated. Jones has lived here for ten years
and is regarded as reliable. Some stress
is laid on his statement since the es

was resumed to-day. M. Parmentler, the
lawyer who used to represent the Craw
ford brothers in their suits, was examined
and said that Henry Crawford engaged
him In October, 1895, as his lawyer. Henry
told him that one of his relatives had
died In Nice, leaving the bulk of his for
tune to Madame Humbert, but a second
will was discovered changing the disposi
tion of the inheritance.
M. Parmentler gave details of the com
plicated litigation, maintaining his belief
that the Crawford brothers actually ex
isted. Madame Therese frequently inter
rupted,'denying certain of M. Parmen
tler's statements.
Several witnesses were called, who tes
tified that they had eeen the Crawfords.
Lecompte # a bailiff, testified that he had
served papers upon the two brothers,
Henri and Robert, saying that they did
not resemble Romalft and Emlle d'Aurig
nac, Madame Humbert's brothers. He
stoutly resisted the view of the court
that members of the Humbert family had
Impersonated the Crawfords.

SEDAL1A, Mo.. Aug. 11.â When the
north-bound Missouri, Kansas and Texas
flier, train No. 6, was derailed and dltcH
cd two miles north of Schell Cltv, Ver
non County, at 11:30 o'clock last night,
twenty-one passengers were injured, but
no one was killed. Spreading rails caused
the derailment. Tho wreck was one of
the worst the road has sustained in years
and thf track was not cleared until late
this afternoon.
The uostal Car, combination mail car
and a chair car were badly wrecked,
while throe others were derailed. The
engine with the first car of the train
plowed about 150 yards before It was stop
ped, tearing up the track, j The injured:
He replied: "By no means. The mobs
have included the highest in the landâ
officials and professional men."
He declared that the white man would
be lynched as quickly as a negro for an
offense against a white woman's honor.
He Instanced in brief the only lynching
In New Orleans In recent years.
Another question was: "Are not the
Southern mobs largely 'white trash' and
men of murderous intent?"
The lyncher does not exterminate the crimi
nal, but he holds him mightily In check. As
a sheer, cold, patent fact, the mob stands to
day as the most potential bulwark between
the women of the South and such a carnival of
crime as would Infuriate the world and pre
cipitate the annihilation of the negro race. The
marses of the negroes are not afraid of death
coming- on In the regular way. They love dis
play and the spectacular elements of a trial
and execution appeal to their Imaginations.
Kxpeditlng the processes of the law would
not be adequate to eliminate lynching:. The
repeal of the amendments and the establish
ment of the negro's Inferiority in law and so
ciety, though desirable, are not sufficient, for
the negro Is a thing of the senses and with this
race and with all similar races the desire of
the senses must be rentralned by the terror
of the senses, if possible under the law. Sepa
rate laws for white or black or the treatment
of this particular kind of crime as separate
and outside of all other codes are but expe
dients; there Is no real remedy but one. No
statute will permanently solve this problem,
lteligion does not solve It. Education compli
cates It. Politics complicates It. The truth
which lies beyond and above all these tem
porizing exjrt-dlents Is that reparation Is the
logical, the inevitable only solution of this
great urobJem of the races.
In the afternoon conference, John Tem
ple Graves answered questions. The
North and South were about equally
represented. Graves' plan for the solu
tion of the race troubles is to set aside
a State for negroes and disfranchise them
outside of that State. He proposed no
general exodus, but a gradual emigra
tion. He said the South would not object
to the loss of the negroes, for it was
learning the superiority of white labor.
"Is mob execution," he was asked, "a
matter of economy to the South?"
"No," he replied. "The South never
weighs money in the matter of woman's
honor." W â¢./.?. :
Among to-day's speakers was John
Temple Graves of Atlanta, Ga., who
spoke on "The Mob Spirit of the South."
He defended lynch law as a remedy for
attacks upon women, holding that though
lynching is a crime, It Is Justified by the
crime which provokes it and will never
be discontinued until that crime is elim
inated. The remedy for lynching must be
elimination of the crime inciting it, and
this, he maintained, could be done only
by the separation of the two races in the
United States. He continued:
The problem of the hour Is not how to pre
vent lynching in the South, but the larger
question: How shall we destroy the crime
which always has and always will provoke
lynching? The answer which tho mob returns
to this vital question Is already known. The
mob answers It with the rope, the bullet and
sometimes, God save us, with the torch. And
the mob is practical: Its theory Is effective to
a large degree; the mob is to-day the sternest,
the wrongest and the most effective restraint
that the age holds for the control of certain
crimes.

The chief event of the day was the
departure under guard of Convict James
Roberts for Folsom prison, where he ar
rived without incident. Roberts doubt
less would have preferred to travel in
solitary state, but this privilege was de
nied him. as he was obliged to go in
irons with Patrick Gorman, a plain, or
dinary burglar under sentence of six
years, passed by Judge Hart yesterday.
Roberts has been very uncommunicative,
although to-day he volunteered the re
mark that if it had not been for the
treachery of an ex-convlct in betraying
his whereabouts he never would have
been caught."
A report was received to-day of the
appearance of an armed man, supposed
to be a convict, in a wheat field near
Gait, but when hunted the man disap
peared. There was* nothing upon which
to base the. suspicion tnat he was a con
vict, but the report was as promising as
most of those brought to the attention of
the officers of late. '1
Aug. 11.â The day
passed without any developments in the
man^niint. The Sheriff and his officers
Have withdrawn from the chase, while
the Police Department has apparently
abandoned hope of running across any
of the escaped convicts. It is admittted
by all who have watched the course of
events for the past week that the situa
tion looks less hopeful for the recap
ture of the escapes. Even rumors are
less frequent and Sacramento is no
longer a center of activity In so far as
the man-hunt is concerned. The Sheriff
to-day returned his rifles to the parties
from whom he had borrowed them.

ROBERTS BACK IN FOLSOM.
Sheriff Bosquit made a search of China
town this afternoon In the hopes of find
ing Convict Case. All Information re
garding Case now seems to point to the
fact that he Is hiding In this vicinity, ly-
Iflg low In the daytime and sneaking Into
the Chinese quarter during the night to
get his supply of opium.
The Sheriff visited and thoroughly In
spected every Chines* den in the city, but
no trace Â«f Case was found. A watch was
placed on all the Chinese dens In the city
and If Case puts in appearance to-night
he will receive a warm reception.
Should they give the Slide and Silver
Lake the go by, another theory put for
ward Is that, being provided with provis
ions, they will make a roundabout detour
through the fastnesses of the wild and
almost uninhabited mountainous region
they are now In and later on will make
Carson or adjacent railroad towns their
objective point and one by one take
brakebeam from there for the Eastern
shore.
Theron, with matchless shrewdness,
cunning and expertness planned the
break from Folsom Prison and It Is
thought he will devise way* and means
to make a break out Of the Slide with
his gang. If he Is there, elude his pur
suers and land up In rJevada, where the
members will separate and strike out for
the East.
The Bosguit party, headed . by Gilbert
Cook and Ferrel and his hounds, which
left Leak Spring Monday morning, have
pushed forward and at latest report had
Kone. three miles Into the Devils. Slide.
If the escaped convicts have secreted
themselves In Devils 'Slide they have
reached a stronghold that w:ould require
nn army of tremendous proportions to
capture them. Hunger alone would bring,
them forth. Sheriff Bosqult reports to
night that on Monday afternoon the The
ron gang robbed three sheep herder camps
nnd secured en6ugh food to last thrm for
several weeks. If this Is the case and
the convicts are entrenched In Devils Slid*
they ean defy their pursuers for some
tlmft to come.
PLACERVIL.LE, Aug. lh-Sheriff B5s
quit to-night stated that he had Just re
ceived Information by telephone from,re
liable sources at Jackson that Sheriff
Norman and his party of twenty-six men.
Instead of remaining at Silver Lake to
watch for the. escaped convicts, have
moved on to Round Top, which is near
KIrkwood station, twelve miles farther
east from Silver Lake. Norman is acting
upon the supposition that Theron and his
companions will go directly to that point
and he wants to be ready to receive them.
If his assumption Is correct he undoubt
edly- stands a good chance to catch the
escapes.
Special Dispatch t6 Thfe Call.
The Pope retired earlier than usual,
saying he left quite recovered. His in
timates say that he is much changed
since his election and seems to have
grown much older. His sisters in' .Venice
were much alarmed over the news of his
indisposition and have decided to come
to Rome to attend him.
The Pontiff seems more docile to thfi
doctor's wishes than his predecessor, al
though he Insisted on transacting: some
current business, such as the appointment
of Alberto Silt, the son of the dean of
the grooms, as his personal valet, tho
place occupied by Plo Centra under Pope
Leo XIII. Dr. Daveneslsa, speaking
about the Pope, said:
If they wish our PiuÂ« not to succumb, thn
Vatican authorities mupt Chang* their system.
They must not obliee fcim to follow the habits
of Pope Leo. The present Pontiff needs plenty
of fresh air. He must not be shut up In a box
in a vitiated atmosphere.
Although the Pope was much better this
afternoon. Dr. I^apponl. who visited him
again, thought It more prudent for his
Holiness not to leave his apartment and
not to go Into the garden of the Vatican,
as he desired. The doctor further in
sisted on a suspension of audiences.
PONTIFF MUST HAVE BEST.
Fortunately, among the Venetians
present was Dr. Daveneslsa. who for
nine years has been the Pope's attend
ing physician at Venice, but had been
called only once during that time, and
then only to treat a sore throat. Dr.
Daveneslsa gave the Pontiff immediate
assistance, while the messengers tele-
Phoned for Dr. Lapponl. The latter
rushed to the Vatican, but did not ar
rive until after tho Pope* had been re
stored to consciousness and taken to his
own apartments.
When able to speak again the Pope,
asked for a few drops of water, which
were given him. and water was
ppiinkled on his face. Ills gown was
opened at the neck, as he seemed to bo
choking. He refused resolutely, how
ever, to be carried to his apartments, say
ing that he was sufficiently strong to
walk. The way thither was cleared and
h*Â» proceeded slowly, surrounded by his
anxious entourape. his head bent almost
to his shoulders and his face'so pale that,
the flesh was scarcely distinguishable
from his robes. The neck of his gown
still remained opened.
It was a solemn moment when the
Pontiff passed through the midst of the
kneeling- Venetians, without having the
strength 'to give them his benediction.
Deep silence accentuated the impresstve
nens of the scene. As he went out of
sight through the Raphael loggia tears
fell on thÂ« cheeks of several of the
pilgrims, and one could not refrain from
crying 1 out:
Take care of yourself, your Holiness, for our
FakfE, who love you so much, as well as for
your own.

already he has.. been, overcome by the
unaccustomed strain of his pontifical

DR. McCRACKEN SPEAKS.
t)r. C. L. McCracken of Pescadero, Su
pervisor from the fifth township, says
"I have heard that the pool sellers were
behind the movement to Incorporate Col
ma, but of course I cannot state that I
know that positively. The exorbitant de
mands for territory and the desire to In
clude the cemeteries would certainly tend
to confirm that suspicion.
"If certain unscrupulous parties should
gain control of it, incalculable harm would
thereby be done to the whole county.
They must not get a hold on the ceme
teries at any rate." Â«â¢
"Colraa is the key to San Mateo Coun
ty. It can be better governed by the
county than by any ring of unscrupulous
people who might get control of It. The
demand for an area of territory, six times
as large as that of Redwood, the county
seat, is preposterous and must on the
face of it be prompted by the manifest
desire to make a town out of Colma at
any costs. ' . .
"If they want to run their pool rooms
let them look to them for the means of
supporting their town government. I do
not believe In robbing the places of the
dead to pay for the vices of the living."
Joseph Debeneditti of Halfmoon Bay,
Supervisor of the fourth township, is
more outspoken against the project of
the pool sellers than his associate from
the first township. He says:
"The only thing we can do is to limit
their territory so as not to grant them
protection. If we keep the San Bruno
road open as an outlet from the county
into San Francisco they will at least be
without protection at our hands. They
say that they will not accept Incorpora
tion unless they can have the cemeteries.
I, for one, am not in favor of turning
the revenue from the cemeteries into the
hands of the town of Colma.
MUST HAVE CEMETERIES.
Besides this there is on record a pro
test filed on August 3 by forty-five resi
dents of Colma. couched In equally strong
terms. Letters show that A. J. Spring of
the Holy Cross Cemetery and M. Jensen,
superintendent of Mouht Olivet, after
signing the petition, became apprised of
the real purpose to which it was being
stultified and requested that their names
be withdrawn. Cypress Lawn has also
filed a protest and petition that their
territory be excluded from the proposed
incorporation.
The position of the Supervisors toward
tfie plea for incorporation isÂ« problemati
cal. They all admit that .they have been
cognizant of the fact that San Francisco
pool sellers are behind the movement,
but declare that by the law of 1SS3. pro
viding for the Incorporation of munici
palities, they are bound to grant any
request which has the requisite number
of bona fide signers.
J. Eikerenkotter of South San Fran
cisco, Supervisor for the first township,
seems to accept the inroads of the gamb
lers as inevitable and desires only to
hinder their nefarious trade. He says:
"I know that John Daly of San Fran
cisco Is engineering this scheme through
and that he has powerful influences of
well kno'wn gamblers, whose names I will
not mention, behind him. Of course they
desire the incorporation of Colma in or
der that they may make a second Bau
salito out of it.
PROTESTS ABE FILED.
Already there are deposited with the
County Clerk at Redwood proof? that
thorp are pome of the residents of Colma
who will not peaceably submit to the rulo
pf the gamblers. The following clause
from a protest signed by twoscore resi
dents of the Abbey Homestead district
phows that their sentiments are strongly
against incorporation:
"We know that Incorporation would
largely Increase our taxes without giving
us any corresponding increase In benefits
or substantial Improvements. We see no
necessity for Incorporation at this time.
We consider the territory proposed to
be included In -the limits of said town
to be entirely too extensive. We cannot
understand why miles of farming and
vegetablA lands should he Included In the
proposed Incorporation. In our minds no
system of Improvements could be devised
that would equally and advantageously
affect the widely diffuse population of
this diversified * and limitless territory.
We think that any such system of im
provements would occasion such a high
tax rate that It would result in many
Instances in great hardship to many peo
ple and the practical confiscation of their
property."
Outside of the cemeteries the only
sources of revenue by which a municipal
government could be supported are hog
ranches, small truck gardens and
stretches of grazing lands. But in the
places of the dead there He the springs
which are being relied, upon to keep In
operation the mock government which Is
to authorize organized pool-selling.
From the license of $1 required at pres
ent, by tho county for every Interment,
there accrues to the county treasury a
sum of from $230 to $100 a, month. This
would be diverted into the town treasury
of Colma. The Cypress liiwn Cemetery
alOhe pays into the county $10C9 a year
taXfs on* Its 200 acres of property. This
as well as all the rest of the burial places
would have to duplicate their county
taxes for the support of the municipal
government. The revenue from the cem
eteries alone would pay for tne piiv'
lego of supporting poolrooms at their
gates.
Besides including the lands of several
large estates of which the Abbey Home
stead Association is the most important,
this impudent demand of the gamblers
embraces the lands of the following cem
eteries: Holy CrOss, Mount Olivet, Cypress
Lawn, the Servian Cemetery, the Italian
Cemetery and the four" Jewish places of

ity, Home of Peace and Salem Fields.

Many r oA '" r^Tl** claimed the bodies
of their children and relatives, and tried
to take them home, but the police gently
but firmly insisted on the bodies being
taken to the morgue and barracks, in or
der that the magnitude of the catas
trophe might be determined. At the Ho
tel <!l<? Ville the President of the Muni
cffcol Council unnouncM that the city
of Parts would bear the entire expense
of the funerals of the victims.
The train which caused the accident
came from Porte Dauphine at the en
trance to the Bois de Boulogne, in the
western part of Paris. After circling the
northern quarter of the city, -where num
bers of workmen were picked up, the
train reached the neighborhood of the
Cemetery of Pere I>a Chaise, where the
flertrical motor failed to act properly.
The train then waited at the station of
I,cs Couronnes until the arrival of a
Fecond train, which pushed the crippled
train forward, making a total of sixteen
roaches. After proceeding about 2(0 yards
toward Menilmontant station the dam
ftged motor set fire to the engine of the
lirst train. The fire burned fiercely.
Simultaneously the electric lights on the
trains went out, leaving the passengers
In darkness except for the light of the
burning engine, far ahead. This impeded
the progress of the trains toward Men
ilmontant. The terror stricken passen
prrs got out and tried to grope their way
back. The powerful electrical current
which continued in the rails is believed
to have stunned or killed many. A num
ber of the passengers managed to reach
I,os Couronnes station, but the main body
eÂ«f the passengers was overcome by the
heat and smoke.
COLLISION ADDS TO HORROR.
A terrible panic occurred among those
behind and the horror of the situation
was increased by a third t~ain crashing
into the fiery mass and adding- another
crowd of panic stricken rjassengers to
those pecking an outlet. The cars con
tinued to burn until twenty were con
sumed. The burning debris gave forth
a fierce heat, which puffed out of the
mouths of the stations of Lcs Couronnes
and Mcnilrnontant. The escape of most
<if the trainmen was due to their su
perior knowledge of the subterranean
passage.
The chief station master at Les Cou*
ronnes. M. DIdlcr, says he saw the flames
i unning along the gear of the cars when
the first train passed through the sta
tionj and called out to the engineer to

the next station, bnt the engineer de
clared he had ample time and proceeded.

intended and man and machine plunged
into the -water. Two linemen rushed to
aid Spauldingr, but in their excitement let
go entirely , of. a rope, one end of which
they had thrown to the drowning man.
The body was recovered badly entangled
in the rope .which had been thrown him.
Mr. Spauldlng was, en route to Chicago

the question whether the process em

solutions was ordered and upon the report
the board will take action.

SAN BERNARDINO, Aug. 11.â A deci
sion which is of great interest to cities
of the fifth class throughout the State
was rendered here to-day in the habeas
corpus proceedings which were recently
instituted by M. A. Pace, president of
the San Bernardino Retail Grocers* Asso
ciation, who Imd been arrested for re
fusing to take out a license under the
terms of a taxing ordinance adopted last
month by the Board of City Trustees.
The ordinance which Pace violated is
one passed to secure much needed ,reve
nue for city improvements and 'provides
for a special license tax on more than
fifty business trades, including the gro
cery business. The merchants rebelled
at the idea of restoring a depleted treas
ury by means of special taxation and
they retained attorneys to break the ordi
nance. A bitter contest followed and in
the decision rendered to-day the ordinance
is declared to be invalid. It was decided
that a municipality of the class in which
San Bernardino finds herself cannot tax
a business for revenue only.
The main contention^jf counsel for the
Grocers' Association was that a business
of ,the character of a grocery trade was
not one which needed police regulation
and was not the subject of a special tax
by the municipality. It was further con
tended that the ordinance in question ar
bitrarily designated a certain class of tax
payers who must pay a special tax in
addition to the regular rate and no legal 1
or constitutional reason could be shown
for this discrimination. The court in de
ciding the .application for the writ of
habeas corpus held with the grocers on
both points.
The effect of the decision under the
law as it now stands is tnat no city or
ganized under' the municipal incorpora
tion biH* of this State can require a li
cense of any lawful business except in
such business as may require police reg
ulation. The decision will greatly ham
per the collection of taxes, which are
needed for public improvements in tnis
city.

Henley was taken to the County Jail at
Martinez this afternoon to answer the
charge of assault to commit murder pre
ferred by his father-in-law and perhaps
the graver charge of murder. An affect
ing scene took place between husband
and wife in the rear of the Union saloon,
which answers the purpose of both court
room and Jail, Just before the officers
-I fed my horses this morning and then went
upstairs, to my room. Henley followed and
said Inla threatening way: "What did you
mean by saying I would leave this place be
fore you?" I told him I didn't say It. He
said:- "You did." I said: "Who told you
so?" He said: "Alice, my wife, told me, so."
"Well," I said "I don't want any of your
insinuations aro'und here. Get out of here."
Then I turned around to slap him in the face
and aÂ« I turned he began shooting. Then I
ran to get what I supposed was a crowbar.
But it wa"B a rifle. He kept shooting all the
time, and finally my daughter came upstairs
and took the rifle from me.
Lafferty, even after, having been told
that he could not live, was very bitter
against his son-in-law, and was in so un
forgiving a frame of mind that he signed
a complaint against Henley, charging him
with assault' to commit murder. The
statement he made of the affair differs
from that of the Henleys, but in the main
points is substantially the same. He said:
stomach and pulled the trigger. It did not go
oft and I fought with him. While we were
fighting: my wife came in and took the rifle
away and I started â¢ to go, for I did .not want
any more trouble. Then Lafferty knocked my
wife â¢ down â¢' and took the rifle from her and
aimed it at me again. He pulled the trigger
once ' and " was " going to do so again when I
fired at him; I don't know how many times.
I am sorry I shot him and I hope he will
not die but I shot him in defense of my life.
If I hadn't shot him he surely would , have
killed me if not to-day, then some other
time. " v

Henley's story was corroborated In
every , detail by Mrs. Hehley, who was
present almost at the beginning of the
trouble. '

DR. XTLMXr&'S SWAMP-BOOT.
HOW TOJIND OUT.
Fill a bottle or common glass with your
water and let It stand twenty-four tours; '
a sediment or settling indicates an un-
healthy condition of the kidneys; It It
stains the linen it is evidence of kidney
trouble; too freqrsnt desire to pass It, or
pain In the back Is also convincing proof
that the kidneys 'and bladder arÂ« out Â«t
order.
WHAT TO DO.
There is comfort in the knowledge so
often expressed that Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, the great kidney and bladder rem-
edy, fulfills every wish In curing rheuma-
tism, pain in the back, kidneys, liver,
bladder and every part of the urinary
passage. It corrects inability to hold wa-'
ter and scalding pain in passing it, or bad
effects following use of liquor, wine or
beer, and overcomes that unpleasant ne-
cessity of reins compelled to go often dur-
ing the day, and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the ex-
traordinary effect of Swamp-Root is soon
realized. It stands the highest for its
wonderful cures of the most distressing
cases. If you need a medicine you should
have the best. Sold by druggists in flfty-
cent and one-dollar sizes.
You may have a sample bottle of
Swamp-Root, the great kidney remedy,
and a book that tells all about it. both

The election in the Fortieth Aseembfy
District was one of the quietest hÂ«ld" in
lhat pection tor years. At none of the
six polling places was tbÂ«?re a single in
cident that would tend to destroy order
and a general spirit -of friendllnees pre
vailed between the opposition camps. It
bad been predicted that bitterness might
enter into the fight, but such waa 'not the
case. bSJ
Both of the Republican tickets were
known as United Republican League tick-"
cts and both had thÂ» backing of certain
high powers in the league. John Lynch
Â»as known to be openly favorable to the
Crimmins ticket, while Ruef was said. to
countenance the Welch end of the fight.
The Welch ticket waa euccessful. ' '
Senator Jlichard J. Welch fathered one
of the Republican tickets and Phil Crim
mins was behind the other, although
Crimmins was too busy in other parts of
the city to pay personal attention to this
district. He was represented by Jimmy
Boyle and Felix Dugan, who kept Jtiuey
In rubber-tlrod buggies rounding up such
voteÂ« Â«ui they thought wÂ«re safe for their
delegates.
Order prevailed throughout the Thirty
second District, although there were two
Republican tickets In the field and the
rivalry among the factions was very
irreat. Not a single fight attributable to
the election was reported from any of the
precincts in the district. The statuesque
policemen stationed at the polls had noth
ing more to do than lend beauty to the
ecene.
With the exception of a trivial row
between two members of the rival fac
tions, the election passed off quietly in
the Forty-fourth District. The United
Republican League had the most ardent
supportrrs and when the polls closed it
*Â¦&* plainly evident that the cause of
irtip Republicanism had won by a large
mtlorlty. Martin Kelly had a number
of his "workers" in the field, but despite
their efforts to win votes for the de
throned boss they could not stem the
tide of defeat.

Those Who Will Select the Next
Municipal Ticket.
REPUBLICAN DELEGATES.
The fight In the Twenty-eighth District
was a clean one and the result was a
foregone conclusion soon after the polls
opened.
Some of Kelly's men were proclaiming
last night that they had been defeated by
the use of money, but no attention was
paid to the;Â«e assertions.
Martin Kelly was hopelessly beaten in
the Twenty-eighth District long before
noon yesterday. The Republicans in the
district voted early for the delegates on
the ticket ' headed by Colonel Kirkpatrick
of the Palace Hotel, and before the noon
hour Kelly and his lieutenants -admitted
that they had been beaten. The predic
tion that Kelly would be defeated by a
vote of two to one was verified last' night
when the votes were ciunted and the
handsome majority of 2H3 votes was an
nounced for the "Kirkpa.trlck ticket."
There was no report made by the police
of any trouble at the polls In Martin Kel
ly's home district, and whe nthe follow
ers of the boss realized that there was
no chance of victory, they left the neigh
borhood of the polling booths and the aft
ernoon hours of the election were very
quiet.
Last night at the headquarters of the
United Republican League there was
great rejoicing over the result of the
election, and many predictions of Repub
lican victory in November. Among the
defeated Jesse Marks exhibits the least
soreness, but he admits that the result
was a surprise.
The honor of overthrowing Martin Kel
ly belongs in a measure to Harbor Com
missioner John C. Kirkpairick, who head
ed the league ticket In the Twenty-eighth.
Henry Ach headed the ticket in the
Fortieth that put Jesse Marks in the back
row. In the Thirty-eighth Alex Truman
was easy game for one of his brightest
pupils, Isidore Golden.
Senator Dick Welsh deserves special
credit for the defeat of the Crimmins
ticket in %4e Thirty-second District.
LEAGUE BEJOICES.
t The victory won by the adherents of
the t'nited Republican Ix>apue was com
plete anfl derisive. The overwhelming de
feat of boss Martin Ke!iy in his own
stronghold, the Twenty-eighth Assembly
Dlstrict, will be accepted by the people of
thfr State at large as a most gratifying
triumph In the cause of clean politics.
One of the closest fights on ..ne Repub
lican field was In the Forty-first Assem
bly District, where Judpo Dibble, rein
forced by members of the Horace Davis
Club, unfurled the banner of "Home
Rule" and gave battle to the league. Dib
ble dispiayed good generalship, but the
tried a.nd true Republicans of the district
supported the league ticket and won out
by a majority of 9*. In other districts
where opposition was put up the league
won by these majorities:

Michael Casey is prostrate. Jim O'Brien
and Sam Rainry" of ' the Democratic
Leafrue are down and Gavin McNab and
M. Jasper McDonald are again winners.
The total vote at the primary as fore
casted by The Call exceeded SJ.OOO. The
oflicial figures at .the Registrar's office
place the number at :6,CC1. As predicted
the Republican vote was much larger
ihsn that of any other political party.
.This response on the part of Republican
vorVrc is regarded as a sign that the
party will win out at the municipal
flection on Tuesday. November 3. Yes
terday the Republicans cast 13.30G votes,
the Democrats 7443. the -Union Laboritcs
5066 and the Socialists 206.
THE battip of the primaries is over
and among the slain on the Re
publican field are Martin Kelly.
Jcfse Marks, Phil Crimmins,
Kelly ran across the street and was lost
to view. When Fowzer appeared at the
polling place later to cast his vote he
was told that his name had already been
voted, and the election officers refused
to allow Fowzer to cast his vote, al
though some of the officers were in
favor of permitting him to exercise his
privilege.
Charles Dodge reported to the Regis
trar just as the polls were closing that
Artie Kelly had voted the name of
George Fowzer, the photographer, in the
Ninety-fifth general precinct. Forty
second Assembly District, located at 218
Eddy street. Dodge nays that he saw
Kelly coming out of the booth and when
he learned that the name of Fowzer had
been voted he called out to Kelly:
"Here, Kelly, your name is not Fow
zer."
voters brought their ballots pith them
and both factions found difficulty in keep
ing tab on how they stood.
In the afternoon Marks expressed grave
doubt that he would be able to hold his
district. Later he gave up hope. This
was a source of jubilation for the United
Republican League, and Ach's backers
awaited the result of the count. Marks
stated that he would die game an* wish
rd success to the man who might beat
him. Early in the evening the news
spread throughout the district that Marks
was down. There was great rejoicing
over the triumph at headquarters of the
Republican Primary League.
Â¦ At 3:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon
George McGillivray telephoned to the
Registrar's office that Eddie Graney was
purchasing votes in the Interest of the
"Horse and Cart" ticket, and -was run
ning In Ftuffers at the polling placo, 1311
Taylor street, being Treclnct 100 |n the
Forty-third Assembly District. Registrar
Walsh immediately asked the Chief of
Police to detail two policemen to arrest
any one who was found violating the law.
Walsh also went to the polling place, but
did not find Graney there. Walsh ascer
tained from a negro nara^d Smith, who
was peddling tickets for Mayor Schmitz.
that some man had voted the name of
Harry Hill. The signature on the roster
did not in any way compare with the sig
nature of Harry Hill on the register.
Smith also said that a boy who was
evidently under age had voted another
voter's name, and that at least two other
stuffers had voted. Smith alleges that
just before the four votes were cast he
saw Graney accost a policeman who was
on duty at the polling place and take him
around the corner. Then the four stuff
ers are said to have voted the, names of
other electors.

SALT LAKE, Utah, Aug. 11.â Walter
Edgar, a 15-year-old boy, has confessed
to the police that he wedged a large bolt
in the; frog of Jthe 'Saltair track at tha
crossing at Ninth and West streets last
night with the object of wrecking one of
the Saltair passenger trains. The bolt
was discovered only a few moments be
fore a' heavily laden train went by and
had not the obstruction been removed
the loss of life would have been heavy.

The question that is agitating the voters
of the Thirty-fourth Assembly District
Just now is who shall pay for the rig used
by Supervisors McClelland and Walsh in
that district yesterday. They were out
from early morn until the polls closed
yesterday evening doing politics along the
lines adopted by the old style "horse and
buggy politicians," but strange to relate,
McClelland was boosting for Michael
Casey and Walsh was doing all that he
could to belittle his efforts and carry vic
tory to Mayor Schmitz's party. They are
both Union Labor party men with this
difference: McClelland waa elected by the
Union Labor party, while Walsh was ap.
pointed by the Mayor to fill a vacancy.
The latter stuck to the Mayor and handed
out his pasters whenever opportunity of
fered. McClelland was equally assiduous

WHO PAYS FOR RIGP
From a - political standpoint, the intention
was to have a straight Labor party. That will
entirely depend on the convention Itself. I de
sire an absolutely Independent convention' and
I don't want to be boss, so that whatever they
will do as a body will, of course, be carried
out, bo far as the party Is concerned. Â¦ -
The result clearly shows, and In this I in
clude the Republican party, that the people are
absolutely against corrupt bosses.
Mayor Schmitz clearly showed the
strain of the day's political fight when
seen immediately after the result was an
nounced. He said:
I think it a Just and a telling rebuke to In
gratitude, without mentioning names. 1 also
think that the result clearly ehows that the
wage earners' representatives In the labor
party have every faith in my endeavor* to give
a fair, honest and just administration. It
# shows, too, that they prefer to have some true
and tried representative to one untried.
Now, I want to say something in reference to
the carmen.' In the past a great deal of capital
has been made about the carmen not being In
favor of me. I have always held that such
statements were absolutely untrue; and, while
Home of the carmen have been Influenced by
their leaders against me, I feel safe In saying
that 00 per cent of the men,- if their votes
couid be looked at, would be found to favor
those delegates favorable to me.
MAYOR IS GRATIFIED.
gprie E. Schmftz will be renomi
nated for Mayor by the Union Labor
party. The Superior Court recently de
cided that the Casey end of the party,
represented by the Harders-Bergcr Coun
ty Committee, was the legal governing
body of the Union Labor party. The" vot
ers of the party reversed that decision
yesterday.
To the great amazement of the poli
ticians Schmitz whipped Casey in the big
labor strongholds south of Market street
and captured all the district delegations
to the convention but one, the Thirty
ninth. Whether the Caseyltes will accept
the result or appoint a convention of their
own remains to be seen. The returns
show that 5066 voters of the party partici
pated in the primary contest.
THE success achieved yesterday at
the primary election by the Ewell-
Aubertine faction of the labor
camp renders It certain that Eu-

before a large audience In the Central

Men's League. He chose for his topic,
"Cecil Rhodes. Empire Builder." and gavo
a detailed account of the great work

races. The 220-yard race was a tiÂ» be
tween G. Dawaon and O. Schultz. The
time for the fifty yards was 2S seconds: 100

clusions with Schmidt. The latter gave
him a close race in the 50 and 100 yard
events at the last championship meet.
After the races the Lurllne Swimmins

This was no more and no less than the
defeat of M. Jasper McDonald, chairman
of the Democratic County Committee.
Moreover, the motto of his district ticket
was: "The best government is none too
good for San Francisco." The Democrat
who enjoys the distinction of having wal
loped the chairman of^the County Com
mittee is W. F. Wedemeycr. It seems
that Sam Rainey was concerned in this
incident. All the signs point to high old
times in the Democratic municipal con
vention. The minority i3 made up of
Democrats who will fight for their rights.
Gavin McNab, who is Justly regarded
as one of the ablest leaders of the Demo
cratic party and one of the most effi
cient of convention managers, may be
called upon to exercise considerable skill
and diplomacy in order to hold a major
ity of the delegates. There can be no
contesting delegations in the convention,
as the Registrar's certificate entitles the
delegate to a seat.
The- date of the Democratic local con
vention is not fixed, but it will be later
than September 15, the time appointed
for the Republican convention to assem
ble. One incident which will be regarded
in hightoned circles of the Democratic
party as extremely deplorable occurred
in the Forty-second District.

BATTLE TO A FINISH
THE United Republican League achieved complete victory yesterday at the primary election.
The push forces, under the leadership of Martin Kelly and Jesse Marks, were beaten hope
lessly. The result is accepted by politicians as the complete extinction of the Burns-Kelly
element of the Republican party. The nomination of clean men for office by the Republican con
vention is expected. Mayor Schmits' faction thoroughly crushed Michael Casey and his small
band of adherents. Gavin McNab seems to have secured control in the Democratic ranks, win
ning ten districts, and claiming a safe majority of delegates in the municipal convention of his
party.

The plans of the California State build-
Ing for the exposition grounds at St.
Louis have been received in this city
from St. Louis, whither they were sent
to receive the approval of Superintendent
Isaac Taylor, who has control of the
grounds and buildings of the big world
show to be opened next year. The pro
posed reproduction of the Santa Barbara
m'sslcn to represent California has met
with the approbation of Superintendent
Taylor. Previous to submitting the
structural plans Governor Pardee and
the St. Louis Commissioners for Califor
nia, Messrs. Filcher and Wiggins, de
cided that the mission type for a State
building was the proper thing.
Newsom & Xewsom have charge of the
work of modifying the ground plans, but
the exterior view will 'be exactly as it
was depicted exclusively for the readers
of The Call at the time the decision was
reached by the commissioners. The next
step will be to send out specifications for
competition by St. Louis contractors.
Probably the California building will be
in actual construction within the next
six weeks. The materials will bt prin
cipally wood and staff, so that the work
will proceed rapidly.
Commissioner Filcher says that the
lowest bid may not be accepted. If such
an iron-clad rule as that should be
adopted it might pave the way for the
State to get the worst of it, aa certain
contractors are tricky. The commission
ers will consider all bids and will ap
prove of the most advantageous bid. The
cost of the building will be about $15,000.

FORMER CLERGYMAN. V^ELL KNOWN IN SAN FRANCISCO 'AND
ALAMEDA COUNTY. WHO HAS ACCEPTED AN ENGAGEMENT AT
THE ALCAZAR THEATER IN THIS CITY.
An adjournment" was taken until this
morning at 10 o'clock. Dillard's direct
examination will continue.
Dillard testified that he frequently re
ceived money from attorneys and from
Chinamen for preparing applications for
certificates and that he accepted the
money because Collector Lynch counten
anced it.
After recess defendant testified in his
own behalf. Although nervous he made
a fairly good witness. Attorney Short
rldge laid great stress on the letter which
was sent to the Collector in Texas and
which is alleged to contain the forged
signature of John C. Lynch. The wit
ness testified that he sent the letter at
the request of Collector Lynch. He said
that when the letter from Texas arrived
it was opened by Collector Lynch in his
presence; that he was directed to reply
that the signature of Collector Lynch
which appeared on the. Tee Too Ton cer
tificate was genuine. Dillard said he
was about to dictate a reply to one of
the stenographers, but was prevented
from doing so by Mr. Lynch, who sug
gested that as the body of the certifi
cate was in his handwriting the letter
ought to be written by him. Dillard
stated that he wrote the letter, and left
it on Mr. Lynch's desk. Mr. t Shortrldge
developed the fact that the witness had
then gone to the races and* In his ab
sence the reply was copied in the letter
press book by, the stenographer. The
copy book was sh\own the witness and he
identified the letter.
"Did you write that signature, 'John
C. Lynch'?" asked Shortridge.
"No, sir; I did not," said Dillard, posi
tively. "1 never wrote Mr. Lynch's sig
nature to any document."
We will show that Dillard never wrote the
name of John C. Lynch in any one of the
documents mentioned. He never wrote that
name to this letter. He never committed the
crime of forgery. We shall hope to prove by
positive evidence that he never passed any
fraudulent document. We shall show you that
he could not have uttered these forged docu
ments because they are not forged. He obeyed
orders and did his duty and he left the city
because of domestic troubles. He sits be
fore you aione, persecuted by every man con
nected with that office. If we establish these
facts It Is unnecessary for me to eay what I
ejepect the verdict to be. -
We will ehow you that these applications for
certificates were not presented by the appli
cant In person, but by attorneys and Chinese
Interpreters. The applicant himself never ap
peared in the flesh before Mr. Lynch or Mr.
Dillard or Mr. any body <lse.
We will show you that Mr. Dillard did not
have exclusive control of these documents.
They -wt re stored in room No. 6. This room
was not exclusive. It was used as a public
consultation room for political purposes; for
dark whimperings and consultations by men
not engaged In official duty. It was used by
Mr. Lynch for the purpose of storing large
quantities of political literature, and men sat
in this room and addressed envelopes to be senlt
to the electors of the State.
Dillard stated that he did three men's
work and by reason of his energy and
knowledge of his duties Collector Lynch
had retained him in the office, despite
the fact that Senator Perkins desired
Dillard discharged.
Attorney Shortrldge decided 'he had
cross-examined Theodore Kytka suffi
ciently on Monday and therefore did not
continue the examination at the open
ing of court yesterday. The United States
District Attorney recalled Collector John
C. Lynch and Special Agent Thomas of
the Internal Revenue Department and
asked them a few questions. The prose
cution rested its case and Shortrldge de
livered his opening statement. He to'.d
the Jury what he intended to prove. He
said:
The prosecution In the Dlllard case
rested yesterday morning and the col
ored defendant went on the stand In his
own behalf. He swore positively that he
had never forged Collector Lynch' s sig*
nature to any document. He also testi
fied that he was Interested in a race
horse and secured permission" on num
erous occasions to attend the races dur
ing business hours. The witness told
about his being at the beck and call of
every deputy in the office. He said he
went more than fifty times to the rail
road offices for Collector Lynch on busi
ness of a private nature.
The defendant swore he left the city on
May 10, 1902, because of troubles with his
wife. The court would not permit his
counsel to develop what this trouble was.
Defendant testified that he tendered his
resignation on three occasions, because
his wife and he could not get along. He
stated that he remained in the office on
the advice and by the persuasion of Col
lector Lynch, who always acted as arbi
trator. . i

NAP A, Aug. 11.â Freddie, the 3-year-old
son of Mr. and Mrs. E. F. Zahler. who
reside near Napa, died suddenly Sunday
under peculiar circumstances. The boy
was stung by a bee Saturday afternoon
and his face swelled up badly. Sunday
morning he was attacked by convulsions
and died a few hours later. He had been
in poor health for some time and the
shock of the sting and poison resulted
fatally.

The very momentous problem whether or not a
city employe has the right to draw from the munici
pality the money he earns if he have debts is now
exercising the legal brains and taxing the lore of the
members of the Supreme Court. Perhaps the ancient
query, "Is borrowed money your own?" might be a
fairly reasonable basis from which to argue the new
Issue to a solution,
England and France, it is reported, are rapidly
reaching the stage where they are ready to discuss,
in all seriousness, the reduction of their enormous
naval equipments. It is safe to assume that the affair
will remain ip the discussion stage for generations to
come. Nations like individuals keep the peace and
treat their associates with respect simply because they
arc afraid of the other fellow.

BOGOTA is so far away from the world of live
news that it is not easy to follow the pro
ceedings of the Colombian Congress with re
spect to the canal treaty. In place of information we
get rumors, and instead *of exact statements we get
somebody's estimate of the chances. Even the State
Department at Washington appears to be ignorant
of the real situation, and the officials enjoy the dip
lomatic luxury of swearing they do not know with
out telling a lie.
The latest advices arc that President Marroquin
is sanguine he can procure the ratification of the
treaty if he is given time, and will ask our Govern
ment to grant an extension of the limit fixed for
the ratification. It is reported that if the request
be made it will be granted; and furthermore it is
announced that in view of the unsatisfactory tele
graphic communication between Washington and
Bogota it is probable that in addition to granting
the extension Mr. Beaupre, the United States Min
ister to Colombia, will be authorized to make a
ther extension should it be needed.
All these reports and probabilities are based upon
the assumption that the opponents of the treaty are
aware they cannot defeat it if brought to a vote, and
consequently are playing for time. The report says:
"The opponents of the treaty in the Colombian Con
gress are prolonging the discussion of the convention
in order to prevent a vote being taken in both
houses in season to secure an exchange of ratifica
tions. There appears to be little doubt that if a vote
could be had 00 the-treaty it would be ratified by a
good majority, but the opponents of the measure
prefer to filibuster .against final action upon it and
delay its ratification rather than to permit a vote and
go upon record as favoring its rejection."
Among other annoyances of the situation is a re
ported disagreement between' the Colombian Gov
ernment and- the companies controlling the telegraph
service. The cause of the disagreement has not

It is gratifying from a humane point of view that
President Roosevelt has so stirred the world' on the
subject,, and thousands of children everywhere will
owe their lives to . him. ...... .
SINCE President Roosevelt gave such decided
expression to his views on race suicide inquiry
into the cause of decline in population has be
come active in Europe and this country. It is an
interesting evidence of the influence of American
thought and the far light cast by the President's per
sonality that his views are quoted from the Thames
to the Neva.
Inquiry in this country has seemed to prove that
the decline in the percentage of increase in the pop
ulation is not so much due to a fall in the birth rate
as to the appallingly high rate of infant mortality.
This is highest in cities, of course, where tenement
conditions are unsanitary and humanity welters in
a dense crowd. But it is too high in fot rural dis
tricts and invites the immediate consideration of pre
ventive means. Infant mortality is mostly due to
diseases of the digestive system and the alimentary
canal. These are largely traceable to the Use of im
pure milk. The adulteration of milk or uncleanliness
in handling it from the cow to the consumer must
answer for wholesale slaughter of infant humanity.
In France Gaston Lcroux first made a survey of
the milk supply. North of the. Loire he found the
milk uniformly bad, poisonous and unfit for use, and
found that fn the same region one-half the infant
mortality is caused by gastritis, the effect of using^
bad milk. In the smaller cities infant, deaths due to
that cause are: At Troyes, 69 per cent; Manset, 63;
Rennes, 64; Amiens, 62; Lille, 56; but in Paris
only 36. This is because in Paris is enforced the
pasteurizing of milk, its sterilization, by the destruc
tion of dangerous germs. South of the Loire the
percentage decreases, because, as M.Leroux ex
plains, north of that river is the great .butter-making
region of France, while scarcely any butter is made
in the south. The milk is deprived of its fats to
make butter and then is adulterated, to conceal its
leanness and sold for consumption. Skim milk, even
if not sophisticated, is an unwholesome food for in
fants, lacking in nourishment and sure to cause such
physical decay in a child as to make it the easy prey
of disease.

PERSONAL MENTION
SENATOR GORMAN is always an interesting
figure in politics. His personality has a cer
tain quality, an inscrutable element that is at
tractive. He has the face and air of a recluse, of a
monk, which is helped out by his low and soft voice
and a certain appealing manner. If one met him
among the monks of Meileray he would seem in
place in that penitent brotherhood who daily throw
ii little dirt out of their own grave.
Behind this outward seeming, however, there ex
ists a watchful, wise and acute spirit that is never
unaware of the interests of the flesh which garments
it on such quiet tones. That spirit has cared well
for the body that houses it, for it has led the lad
Gorman, a page boy in the United States Senate, out
of the back door of the old Senate Chamber and into
the front door of the new, to sit among those he
once served. It has also keenly promoted his ma
terialities as well as his ambitions, and the page boy
has estates and good lands and bonds and stocks
and can write his check among the millionaires.
He is a conscious candidate for the Presidency.
We use the word "conscious" as expressive of the
condition of a man who is aware that something is
happening to him without his volition, and which he
neither invites nor repels. In this condition of con
scious candidacy his passive attitude is not incon
sistent with the utterance of views relating to next
year's political issues. Here the bright spirit that
sits under the cowl of his manner affords a most
interesting study. Senator Gorman coldly abhors
the issues raised by Bryan. He is not known as a
vicious and unreasoning enemy of capital in any of its
forms and combinations. In fact, capital and he can
hob and nob together like men in middle life who
were schoolmates, and meet to recall the flush of
youth and spring as seen from the russet beginning
of the fall.
Capital and .Gorman have never said anything bad
about each other that was not purely Pickwickian.
So while his restrained exterior is that of one who
has long surrendered the pomp and circumstance of
life and who is indifferent to externals, the watch
ful spirit within, the tenant of this house of the quiet
outside, desires that other issues than silver and the
trusts shall be the rag which next year's Democracy
will chew. So that keen-eyed interior, the Gorman
that sits inside of himself, suggests that there are
three issues on which his party will win next year.
These zre the control of the negro, the tariff and
economy and honesty in administration. He gave
the race issue first place^ declaring it to be vital
North as well as South. He regarded the negro
as an abhorrent shadow everywhere and insuscep
tible of control except by the Democracy. To demon
strate this he said that negro crimes and lynchings
disappeared from Maryland as soon as the State be
came Democratic, and appeared in Delaware as soon
as it went Republican. Therefore protection from the
negro and his proper discipline require a Demo
cratic victory next year!
The ; .nner consciousness of Mr. Gorman desired
to widely impress it upon the country that civiliza
tion is at stake and its synonym is Democracy, while
its anonym is Republicanism. Then the trusts, lis
tening from afar and resting from the run they have
had to escape from Mr. Bryan, heaved a sigh of re
lief, and the spirit that lives inside of Mr. Gorman,
but is no more a part of his outside than the lamp
is of the lighthouse, winked one eye.
GORMAN AND HIS ISSUE.
Upon the facts stated in that report Secretary
Schultz could construct a strong argument in favor
of his bill for fixing a standard of food served to the
honest epicure of Milwaukee. A man ordering a
dainty dish fit for a king may be content to accept
bits of black silk for "chopped truffles," since silk
is itself a luxury and none but the rich can afford to
eat it; but when a man orders whole truffles and
gets either a lot of small pieces of soft rubber W
of roasted potato flavored by ether he has a right to
protest, for such things are cheap and he is not get
ting the worth of his money. So, too, a man has a
right to demand, of the 'law a food standard so fixed
that no one shall be permitted with impunity to meet
a call, for lobster by serving a plate of cuttlefish.
The only valid objection that could be urged to the
Schultz proposition is that it would be special leg
islation on behalf of the rich and the luxurious. The
ordinary American does not eat snails as a steady
article of diet, and is in no danger of getting a dose
of "horse lungs" by asking for choice "Burgun
dians." For him, therefore, the legal standard of
food served at hotels and boarding-houses would be
of no benefit. Perhaps that is the reason why the
announcement of the preparation of the ordinance
has been received with such general laughter. Let
Secretary Schultz wait until the scientific food fiends
begin , to adulterate cornbeef hash, mince pie and
other simple foods of the masses, and then he will
find those who have been so witty at his expense turn
to him with joy, and, hailing him as the greatest re
former of the day, mention him for the Presidency.
There has just been given out at Washington a
summary of a report from Consul Guenther of
Frankfort on the extent to' which adulteration is
practiced in the manufacture of some of the finer
table delicacies for which Germany and France are
famous. The report says: "An ordinary liver patty
is made into Strassburger pate de foie gras' by means
of borax or salicylic acid and of finely chopped and
cleverly distributed pieces of black" silk, representing
truffles. Cosmos, a German paper, states that, un
der the label of canned lobsters, the soft parts of the
cuttlefish and crabs are sold. In Paris snails are
adulterated with lungs of cattle and horses.. Even en
tirely artificial snails are manufactured. The shells,
recoated with slime, are filled with lung and then sold
as 'Burgundy snails.' Chopped artificial truffles are
made of black rubber, silk or softened leather, and
even whole truffles are made out of roasted potatoes,
flavored by ether. They are said to sell well."
EASTERN reports announce that Secretary
' Schultz of the Milwaukee Health Department
is framing an ordinance fixing a legal standard
for food furnished by hotels and boarding-houses. It
is not likely the ordinance will be enacted even if
it be reported, for it has been greeted with so much
merriment and mockery that it can hardly be ex
pected to withstand the gale. In fact, it is not im
probable that by this time the would-be reformer
has put his bill away and is trying to convince the
public that he was joking from the start.
There would be, however, some merit in such a
bill provided it were made to run against the richer
restaurants and the higher priced hotels, for it is in
such places that the unsuspecting American is moat
likely to be made the victim of spurious 'foods and
fraudulent delicacies. The ordinary foods of the
American people, beef, beans, hash and hominy, are
very apt to be the real thing even if served in res
taurants where a square meal* can be obtained for
15 cents; but when one aspires to foreign luxuries,
to truffles and pate de foie gras, he is liable to catch
a sophisticated decoction nine- times out of ten.

AGAINST the mad spirit of lynching that has
been so fearful in its manifestations of late
there has. now appeared the spirit of law
speaking in the voice of the press and of the com
mon sense of the people. The mob spirit has im
pelled its votaries to action. The spirit of law has
thus far hardly gone further than to rouse men to
right utterance in the way of protest and denuncia
tion. So long as the one spirit acts and the other
confines itself to talk we shall have lynchings and
mob violences without number; but when once the
speech of the advocates of law has roused the popu
lar will we shall see an end put to lynching about as
swiftly as ever lynching itself put an end to the life
of one of its victims.;
It would be better if our American law could get
itself enforced with such firmness that mobs and
lynchings would be virtually unknown among us.
We are, however, so jealous of popular liberties that
we have provided no way for the summary punish
ment of outrages of that kind: Thus what appeared
a few years ago to be no more than an' outburst of
brutal race prejudice in remote rural districts of the
South has now become so common that hardly a
week passes without the occurrence of some new out
rage of the kind, and these tak'e place not only in
the South and in sparsely settled districts, but in the
North and the East and in large cities.
So frequent have such offenses become that
thoughtful men no longer look upon them as mere
sporadic outbreaks of a criminal tendency, but as evi
dences of a growing moral disease throughout the na
tion. Thus Professor James of Harvard recently said
that lynching can no longer be regarded as "a tran
sient contagion destined soon to exhaust its viru
lence," but must be studied as "a profound social
disease, spreading now like a forest fire, and certain
to become permanently endemic in every corner of
our country, North and South, unless heroic reme
dies are swiftly adopted to check.it."
A rapidly increasing number of law-abiding men
are forming opinions on the subject not essentially
dissimilar to those of Professor James. In due
time their opinion will become the dominant opinion
of the people, and when that happens lynchers will
have to look out. It will be no longer possible for
them to get public officers to overlook their crimes
or juries to acquit, them in the face of convicting
evidence. They will have to meet an aroused public
conscience and take the consequences.
The "right talk" â the talk that is helping to
form a resolute public sentiment on the subject and
to infuse it 'with a vigor that will prompt to stern ac
tion â is heard not only in the North, but in the
South as well. Over and over again strong, influen
tial and popular men in Kentucky, Virginia, South
Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi have
spoken frankly and fearlessly in condemnation of
lynch law, no matter upon what pretext it is re
sorted to, and their words have found support from
the leading papers of the South. The old voices
of apology, palliation or extenuation of the crimes
of the mob are no longer heard so dominantly as of
old. The voice of protest has become the stronger
of the two, and ere long it will control the situation
and dictate the action of officials and juries.
A good illustration of the improved tone of the
press of the South on the subject is found in a re
cent declaration of the Charleston News and Courier.
After referring to the action of the law officers in
Massachusetts in bringing to trial a number of riot
ers in that State it went on to say: "There is no
reason why we should be concerned about the affair
in Massachusetts. What we are particularly con
cerned about just now is what we shall do with our
latest lynching affair in South Carolina. Surely
Governor Hayward will not permit the murder com
mitted in Aiken County last Friday night by a mob
to pass without the most vigorous prosecution. It
will be a reproach to South Carolina, already cov
ered with reproaches of the same sort shamefully de
served, if all the authority and power of the execu
tive department at Columbia is not exhausted in an
effort to bring the guilty to judgment in this case.
We cannot hope to deserve the good opinion of the
outside world, or merit even self-respect, if we do
not now and in this case make a determined effort to
punish all who participated in it."
Sentiments of that kind spoken or written with
earnest insistence are bound in the end to bring
about a right tone of public sentiment, and with
that will come a solution of the problem that now
appears to be so menacing to our civilization. Mobs
and lynchers may go on for a little while longer with
impunity, but a day of reckoning is coming, and
American law will be vindicated by the American
people.
THE RIGHT TALK.
been stated, but evidently something is wrong, for
the State Department has not been able to get re
sponses from Mr. Beaupre to several important mes
sages sent some time ago. It > appears, in fact, that
the only thing we can do is to wait. Nothing moves
quickly in South America except revolutions. Mar
roquin's request for more time is not surprising.
Perhaps some day the filibusters will go out of
town to a cockfight, and then the administration men
can ratify the treaty and make way for the construc
tion of the great canal.

HALF A HUNDRED WOMEN
ON FAMOUS BATTLEFIELDS
IF the complete story could be told of the devotion and suffering, of
the privations and heroic sacrifices of all the brave women who nursed
the wounded and the dying on both sides in the bloody conflict be-
tween the North and South it would be one of the grandest, most
sublime narratives ever penned. Even when recorded in brief their 'ca-
reers speak volumes for the dangers they braved to minister with gentle
hands and loving care.
"Oh, what breaking hearts many mothers^ are still carrying for their
boys buried in graves marked 'Unknown/ " says Mrs. Mary J. Bos-
ton, one of these fifty-eight fair veterans of that bloody conflict who have
written two full pages of personal anecdotes of their service in the hos-
pital, the bivouac and the battlefield. She not only consecrated her
life to nursing the wounded throughout the entire war, but gave two
brothers to the cause at Friedericksburg and a brother-in-law at Gettys-
burg, and the anecdote of which those few lines are the prelude is one
jf the most dramatically thrilling ever penned. These fifty-eight women
saw the awful struggle with their own eyes â and it is war â actual war â
thnt each and every one of them has written of from her own peculiar
point of view. Those two pages alone will enthrall you.
To the veterans whose names make up the roll of honor of the
Grand Army of the Republic that stupendous struggle must ever be a
vivid reality, but to those of the younger generation the hope and de-
spair of that fierce conflict must be seen through the eyes of the artist,
the writer and the painter alone. It is a remarkable fact that some of
the best battlevscenes ever painted are those depicting our great Civil
War from beginning to end. 89S
It is this fact that has enabled The Sunday Call in its special
G. A. R. Edition next Sunday to present its readers with the best pic-
torial panorama of fiercest battles of the war that can be offered by a
modern newspaper. Beginning with General Grant's victory at Fort
Donelson, these pictures carry you through the entire war to its spec-
tacular close with the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox. which
scene alone, replete as it is with historical characters, is one of the most
notable pictures ever reproduced on a Â¦ modern color press. There is
"The Battle of Shiloh." "Chattnnooga," "The Siege of Vicksburg."
"Sherman's March to the Sea." "The Battle of Gettysburg." "Grant's
Career From West Point to Appomattox," etc.
And in the line of fiction the greatest popularity has ever been given
to tales of love and war. Just think what themes the Civil War had to
offer. And ' what sentiment, too. There is "Forty Years After" in the
next Sunday Call, for instance. It is a story" of the wavering tide of
battle at Vicksburg. with a thrillingly pathetic denouement in this city.
Then there is "A Girl of the South." "Fate's Pence." "A War Vision"
and "Trying Him Out," which latter will bring, back the most stirring
memories to any one who knows anything about war.
And in a different way. how many know, anything about the'
speeches that created that awful slaughter. There are two pages of fervid
eloquence that will simply amaze you who read them now. so many
years after.
â¢ And last but not least 'there is that magnificent Supplement â tender
sentiment crystallized into color â "The Old Army Chest." wherein a
hardy warrior of the rebellion is showing his treasures to his beautiful
fair-haired daughter. Just register a deep-voiced complaint with your
carrier if you do not get this, picture with your G. A. R. Edition of the

That the encampment is close at hand
is evidenced in various ways about the
city, but nowhere is the fact more em
phasized than at the downtown hotels,
where the pressure or business is rap
idly increasing and to such an extent
that it keeps the managers and clerks
busy scheming how to meet the de
mands for accommodations. For the
last three nights all the large hotels
have, been filled to their utmost capacity,
and hundreds of people arriving on the
late trains have been denied lodgings at
these hostelries, for no other reason
than no rooms were to be had. Of
course this condition does not In any
way affect the chances of the delegates
to the encampment getting accom
modations, for their rooms have been ar
ranged for by the local committee, and
the people who now occupy them do so
with the understanding that they will
vacate when the old soldiers arrive.
Those who are attracted to the city by
the cheap transportation rate will have
to find accommodations in the smaller
hotels, of which, however, there are
plenty to meet all requirements.

Prominent members of the G. A. R.
in this city and elsewhere are agitating
a movement to bring about an expression
of opinion from the delegates at the com
ing' encampment in opposition to the pro
motion of General Leonaru Wood to the
position of major general of the army.
It has been learned that sets of resolu
tions bearing on this subject already
have been placed in circulation among G.
A. R. men. Although the resolutions do
not mention the name of General Wood,
it is plainly evident that they are direct
td to his case. The matter, if brought
before the sessions of the encampment,
is exDected to provoke a fierce debate,
for there is a difference of opinion as
to the real purpose of the resolutions,
some contending that politics is involved
in the affair and others that the attempt
to defeat the promotion of Wood is a
scheme in which a numbejr of his enemies
in the army are concerned.
BOARD OF TRADE IS ACTIVE.
The State Board of Trade yesterday
delegated Mrs. Bancroft, one of the mem
bers of the board, to meet the ladies who

also requested to persuade Grand Army

asked if he would be a candidate for the

Special Dispatch to The Call
WASHINGTON, Aug. "ll.â The hurri
cane which yesterday passed over San
Domingo and Martinique probably is ap
proaching the south Cuban coast, with
indications of recurving, but at what an
gle the weather bureau officials are un
able to state. A report from Havana at
7 o'clock to-night said that the wind was
blowing thirty-six miles an hour and was
from the northwest. The hurricane proba
bly will continue in its course northward
somewhere close to the Faraday Penin
sula. Hurricane 'varnings have been sent
to points from- Port Eads .on - the Gulf
coast around the Florida coast up as
far as Jupiter. The storm was central
this morning at Kingston, Jamaica.
The State Department to-day received
a dispatch from Consul Jewett at Fort
de France, Martinique, dated yesterday,
confirming the press report of the disas
trous storm on that island. The dispatch
Bays:
"Terrific cyclone visited entire island
midnight Saturday. Great damage to
crops and fruits. Many houses in Fort
de France unroofed. Trees - two feet
thick uprooted. One man killed. Consu
late intact. At Trinite seven killed; many
houses destroyed. Smaller towns dam
aged. New villages Tivoli, Fond La
Haye, Fourneols and-Reculee destroyed,
*Â£nderinB 5000 homeless."
Reports of Great Damage on
Martinique Island Con
firmed.
It was a varied programme fit to satisfy
the most diversified tastes which the club
members offered. Opera singing, national
airs and sparring by rx-champion Bob
Fitzsimmons were the specialties among
the attractions offered. Whether it was
an aria from "Le Cld" or a strangle hold
in cateh-as-catch-can. the spectators
paid their warmest applause to the efforts
of the performers. .
Out of compliment to the great patri
otic society for whose reception the
Olympic entertainment was given, the
THE reception fund of the G. A. R.
encampment received a goodly
boost as the results of the ladies*
night benefit which was given by
the Olympic Club at the Me
chanics* Pavilion last night, though the
crowd was not as large as was hoped
for.

CHICAGO, Aug. 11.â John McGurk. the
horse which won the Great Western
Handicap, defeating the mighty McChea
ney, seems to be a puzzle to the talent.
A favorite in the mila and a quarter
handicap at Harlem * to-day, with only
three starters, the Dunne gelding finished
last, where he remained from flagfall to
finish. Bessie McCarthy, formerly the
property of E. J. Arnold & Co., end now
owned by Tom Kiley & Co.. and which
could not get up a respectable perspira
tion yesterday, was. backed from S down
to 2. finally closing at 5 to 2, and proved
an easy winner. She had speed to loan
and raced head and head with Bondage
for a mile and an eighth. Then she drew
away and' won as she pleased by nearly
three lengths.
The track was fast to-day, the weather
clear and cool and the assurance that
betting would be conducted as usual
drew out the customary large crowd.

BY INFANTRY TyrARTrRTvrFfs
George Hartlng. official timekeeper for
the Yosemite Athletic Club, visited Harry
Forbes* training quarters at Sheehan's
yesterday and weighed the little cham
pion. Forbes tipped the beam at 113%
pounds. Forbes and Neil agree to weigh
in Thursday afternoon at 116 pounds.
Forbes has cut out heavy exercise. He
takes Bhort sprints on the road and is
doing light gymnasium work. He will be
seconded to-morrow night by Billy Otts,
Jack Hertz, his manager, and Jack Han
ley. Forbes is confident be will retain
the championship. He says he was never
in better condition. He states he worked
out in Chicago with Harry Gilmore be
fore coming to the coast and the work he
has had at the Ocean Beach has put him
in magnificent condition.
Neil Is ready to enter the ring at a
minute's notice. For the past month he
has been training at Croll's under the
watchful eyes of Corbett. He is as hard
aa nails and as fast as any one would
desire. He has had good boxing while in
Alameda and has improved a lot. Frankle
expects to win and wants his friends to
have confidence in him. Nell is below the
weight limit. Danny Sullivan has been
boxing with Nell dally and both 1 lads
have benefited by the exchange v of
punches.
The preliminaries should be very Inter
esting. Jack Cordell and Jack Kane are
to go ten rounds and Danny Sullivan and
Fred Landers are to go the same dis
tance. Cordell is to make his professional
debut. He has been amateur champion
for some time. Kane fought a twenty
round draw with Young Corbett. Sullivan
is a produc't of the Olympic Club. Tommy
Ryan thinks he is a- comer. Landers is
the pride of North Beach,
j Eddio Graney will referee the main con
test. The sale of seata is large. The
little fellows will benefit by the presence
of hundreds of visiting sports.
Neil will have the benefit of the best of
seconds. In his corner will be Spider
Kelly. Tim McGrath, \Frank McDonald
and Australian Tim Murphy.

Special IDispatch to The Call
SARATOGA, Aug. 11.â James R. Keene's
racers won three events here to-day over
a track that was very heavy.
The chief race of the day was the
Delaware handicap, worth $2485 to the
winner, for which' there were five start
era. The weights were so allotted that
all five were at comparatively short
prices.
Almost from the Btart, Gimcrack had
complete control. His action was free,
and, attended by Highlander and Gay
Boy, he drew away from Sheriff Bell
and Hunter Raine. In" the last quarter,
however, Odom's perseverance had its
reward, and though Hunter Ralne's
stride was short and croppy, as com
pared with his action on a dry track,
he gamely followed Gimcrack and forced
Gannon to the whip to land Keene's colt
first home. In a few more strides Hun
ter Raine would have won beyond doubt.
In the first race the California filly, Ada
Nay, showed that her -winning of the
Travers on Saturday was no fluke, by
beating a field of. fast ones. Summary:

Fitz was sounding the praises of Jef

Corbett and incidentally thinking of the
great advertisement the discussion would
prove if spread broadcast. Webster was
once the partner of William A. "After

art of advertising. The outcome of it was
that Fitz placed his signature to a check
calling for $10,000, while Webster signed
one for $8000. The beauty of the transac

In the opinion of experts the battle has
resolved itself down to a question of vi
tality. If Corbett has built up his vital
ity in the same proportion he has built
up his muscles he will have an excellent
chance of winning. If his vitality begins
to ebb during the twenty-four hours be
fore the battle through nervousness, as
some profess to believe it wiH| there can
be but one outcomeâ Jeffries will retain
the championship.
Corbetfs confidence in his ability to
defeat Jeffries cannot be shaken. He ex
pressed the opinion yesterday that on
public form he should be a 1 to 2 choice
over Jeffries instead of as at present,
with the odds on Jeffries.
James J. Corbetfs long season of train
ing: with the purpose of retraining the
heavy-weight championship Is practically
at an end. No one who has observed
the clever big boxer during the time he
has been fitting himself physically to re
cover his lost laurels can say that Cor
bett has neglected anything or that he
did not go through his bodily exercising
with regularity and a remarkable deter
mination. That the actor-fighter is earn
est and honest in his ambition to down
Jeffries none will doubt. Long before
Corbett betook himself to Croll's Gar
dens, Alameda. three months ago he had
been preparing himself for the fight of
his career Friday night. The ex-cham
pion is satisfied with his condition. His
trainers and friends assert that nothing
more can be done to perfect Corbett for
the encounter now near at hand. If he
cannot win now he never can. All that
Is left for Jim and his conditioners to
do is to look happy and wait for the
gong that will sound the attack. This
they are doing and they feel they are
justified, fo rosy do tney consider the
prospects of seeing a two-time holder of
the ring championship Friday night.
Corbrtt indulged in only the lightest of
work yesterday. He went through six
rounds of shadow sparring with Sam Ber
ger and as many rounds of rasy give
and take with Yank Kenny. Then Jim
went after the small punching bag and
mauled Jt for six rounds more. Baseball
afforded diversion for Corbett during the
afternoon. A short stroll in the evening
rounded out the labors of the day. East
ern friends of the former champion are
arriving here dally and all or them ex
press their surprise at what they con
sider the splendid condition of the con
queror of John L-. Sullivan. Denny Kelle
her. a Fporting man of Boston and an
onthusiastlc admirer of the California
fighter, visited Jim at Croll's Gardens
yesterday, as did also several newspaper
men from Bridgeport, Conn.
When Corbett shakes hands with Jef
fries Friday night he will have behind
him as his adviser in chief the wily mid
dle-weight champion of the world. Tommy
Ryan. Corbetfs other seconds will be
his faithful trainer. Professor Tommy
Dare; Tom Corbett. Sam Berger and
Yank Kenny. All of these men are with
Corbett at his Alameda camp and are
thoroughly familiar with every weak and
strong point of the ex-champion. They
know Corbett almost as Â¦well as he knows
himself, and It is unlikely they will over
look-anything Friday night that might
tend to turn the tide of battle in Jim's
direction.

cult question. One of the difficulties which the
employers of labor *re likely to encounter
arises from the fact that, the bulk of the popu
lation, Is composed of persons who either culti
vate Independently their small holdings or are
attached to other persona in a traditional rela
tion not greatly unlike that of feudal depend
ents The part of the population that la
neither in the position of individual cultivators
nor attached to any household or estate is
small and consequently the number of labor
ers actually available Is limited. Persons who
have been accustomed to gain their living in a
certain way cannot be expected to abandon
their ancient habits Immediately on tha ap
nearance of a person or company asking for
their labor. Those who respond to the new de
mand at once are only a part of the supply
of labor which the community In question may
furnish when It shall have adjusted Itself to
the new conditions. It will therefore be Impos
sible to know the labor capabilities of the Phll
'lDDine Islands till they shall have acquired
more of the characteristics of thÂ« Industrial
communities of Europe and America. It may
be safely affirmed that without the admirsion
of laborers from some souice the- supply of
labor will be short for the next fifty years at
least From whatever source the needed . la
borer's come they ought to fulfill certain con
ditions. They ought to be able to thrive In the
tropics; they ought to have the strength and
skill necessary to meet the demands of a so
ciety where much of the heavy work remains
to be done; and they ought to be capable of
an advantageous amalgamation with the pres
ent Inhabitants of the Islands. Immigration
from India or Java Is not only out of the ques
tion but. If possible, would be undesirable. In
fact' there ts no oriental people It would be
more advantageous to admit to the Philippine

commission last I October. The existing law
makes the system of schools a bureau of edu
cation under tho Secretary of Public Instruc
tion In whom rests the final administrative
authority. Under him Is a general superintend
ent of education, and in each division there
is a division superintendent.
There are various practical advantages that
will accrue to the people of the Philippine
Islands from ability to use the English lan
guage. It will supply a common medium of
communication where no such medium now ex
ists. The possession of a common speech will
tend to remove district antagonlcra and break
up the prevailing provincial narrowness and
Jealousy. <A second advantage Is that it will
make possible a political regime of a popular
character, involving and Interesting the In
habitants of all parts of the Island. A third
advantage Is that this knowledge will enable
the Inhabitants of the Islands to read Ameri
can books and periodicals, and thus grad
ually become Informed of the character of
American institutions.
ENGLISH BEING TAUGHT.
After Â»be Filipinos had become convinced
that tha established relations between the
Philippine Islands and the United States were
to be maintained, they manifested a strong
desire to learn tho English language, and the
authorities saw no reason for refusing to Krat
ify this popular desire. On the. contrary thev
believed that to meet this wish would helo
to gtvo to the Filipinos a better understanding
of the purposes of the United States Any
other course than that pursued would have
provoked the Just charge of bungling stunld
ity. The vigorous carrying out of the Gov
ernment's liberal educational policy has shown
a contrast between the Spanish and American
administrations to the advantage of the lat
ter, and this action on the part of tho new
Government has done as much as tho execution
of any single line of policy to convince tha
Filipinos of the benevolent purposes of tha
United States.
But there Is a rational ground for pursuing
In ladla a policy with reference to the use of
the English language different from that pur
sued In the Philippine I<:anls. This difference
of policy. is necessitated by th* different con
ditions In the two, countries.- Jn the first place,
the native. languages of Inditf are language* of
cultivation, anfl there exi#ts in each of them
an extensive literature for all the intellectual
needs of a civilized people. This literature
cannot be set acide without destroying the main
'orce among the people that makes for civil
ization. The Filipinos have no such literature,
and. therefore, to teach thÂ»m the English lan
guage is not to. subject them to any Intellectual
loss, but. on the other hand, to furnish them a
most powerful stimulus to Intellectual progress.
In the second place/ the vastness of India's
population and the strength of itÂ« traditions
make it absolutely necessary that th* India of
the future should be developed out of the India
of the fast. The English have not tried to. lay
a new foundation for Indian society but to
reform the historic society by eliminating Its
unworthy features and Introducing certain
practical elements of Western organization as
well as certain material appliances of our
economic life. The Filipino's history and tradl
dltloris that He hack of hi* contact with Euro
pean* are the history ami traditions of bar
barism, and they have been overlaid by the
social and religious practices of Christian so
ciety, which constitute the real foundation of
whatever civilization the Inhabitants of the
Islands possess. Their civilization Is a Euro
pean product spread over the barbaric past
This European contribution tn the cultivation
of the Filipinos constitutes the only hn*iÂ« nn
which we have to buiM for the future In this
view It appears that the only language of mil
tivation available to the FHIplno is a Eum*
pean language, and with Kn R llsh the language
of the Government It follows inevitably that
thÂ« Filipinos will find greater advantage In lu
use than in the u*e of Spanish. Its only real
tends to develop In the natives a certain self
respect and a sense of equality with thoi>e in
P<>wer. But from our |>olnt of view this is
not a result to be avoided for these qualities
are necessary to enable the FIllpinoR to play
the political role that haa been assigned to
them. Popular self report ami an absence of
the sense of subjection aro essential to the de
velopment of a well ordored system of self gov
ernment.

I'understand that there has been some criti
cism on the commission's policy of teaching
English in the Philippines, based on the Kng
llsh policy In India. I am not surprised, how
ever, to learn that such criticisms have been
made. It was not to be expected that all of
the thousand Intelligent teachers engaged to
assist In carrying out the educational policy of
the Government in the Philippines would ap
prove of every detail of that policy. The pol
icy was adopted before the disapproving critics
were heard from, and it iÂ« not quite clear
that a different course would have bee n pur
sued If their testimony had been received
earlier. The Spaniards In many instances pre
vented the Filipinos from learning the Spanish
language and looked with distinct disapproval
upon the use of this language by the natives.
This is a. policy sometimes pursued to/makea
eubject people feel Its subordination.- By this
they made sharp the line of race distinction.
The authorities In the Philippines have sought
to establish as close relations as possible be
tween the members of the two races, and have
not thought it advisable to . hold the Filipinos
aloof by putting obstacles In the way of their
using our speech.
- Some of the English in India, who wish to
have the natives retain a sense of inferiority
and maintain ah attitude of subjection, are op
posed to their learning the English language
on the ground that a knowledge of this lan
guage will m&ka them feel and assert their
equality with the members of the ruling na
tion. There is no doubt that In India- and in
all lands where a foreign race rules, a knowl
edge of the language of the dominant nation

Professor Moses' three years of' study
and the administrative practice have led
him to draw some interesting conclusions
in regard to the institutions existing In
the Far East. He has high praise for the
business sagacity of the Chinaman and
says that the intermingling of the blood
of the Chinaman and the Filipino would
produce a people that would combine
many of the good qualities of both races.
He also holds that a certain amount of
immigration from China into the islands
will be absolutely necessary to supply the
labor market for at least fifty years.
ALMOST A VIRGIN COUNTRY.
Professor Moses has prepared a careful
statement of the important phases of the
educational problems that confronted the
commission during the pioneer years. The
following is his discussion of the situa
tion in full:
It is now little more than seven months since
I left the Philippine Islands. On the way I
have taken the opportunity to visit the Slralt
Settlements, Java, India and Egypt. On ac
t-ount of my Philippine experience I found Java
especially interesting. Java presents the ap
pearance of an island whose cultivation is car
ried almost to the utmost perfection possible,
while the Philippine Islands are practically a
virgin country. The Intensive cultivation of.
Java has apparently been necessary to keep
the rapidly Increasing population supplied with
food. Hitherto It has been successful, although
In the last ninety years the number of the in
habitants has Increased from about 8,<X>0.000 to
Â«"y,000,000. If the Philippine Islands had rela
tively to the territory as large a population as
Java they would have about 90,000,000 Inhabi
tants. Instead of the 7.000.000 that they now
have. Java stands in sharp contrast to the
Philippines in many respects. It has an abund
ant and Industrious body of workers, while
the workers of tho Philippines are neither
abundant nor very Industrious. The Javanese
are encouraged to raise rice and arc not urged
to seek other occupations than agriculture. The
Filipinos are encouraged to educate themselves
and to prepare themselves for all the occupa
tions that a civilized community may offer.
Schools are a very much less conspicuous fea
ture of the aoclal order in Java than in the
Philippines. The revenues of Java are turned
to the Dutch treasury', and the appropriations
for the Island are made In Holland. The Phil
ippine Islands have their separate treasury
into which arc turned all their revenues, and
appropriations from this fund are made by tho
Philippine government to meet the insular ex
penses. The Governor of Java has a very much
larger official Income than the President of
the United States, and occupies a very much
finer house. In this respect there is also a
contrast between Java and the Philippine*.
The question as to how the prosperity of the
Straits Settlements compares with that of Java
and the Philippines cannot be answered di
rectly, since th* different settlements appear to
be enjoying different aÂ«grees of prosperity. Pe
nang. has been In a large measure eclipsed by
Singapore. If Singapore is taken to represent
the English possessions in that region, the ad
vantage in comparison with the Philippines is
decidedly with the settlement. Singapore seems
to be the most flourishing city Jn the Far East,
and Its prosperity is due in no small degree to
the presence of the Chinese. They own and
occupy large numbers of the fine villas In the
suburbs. Any city that wishes to strike for a
leading position among the cities of the Far
East cannot -afford to leave out of its calcula
tion a serious consideration of the possibility of
success without the co-operation of the Chinese.
It does not appear what people is to furnish
successful rivalry to the Chinese In business
sagacity, commercial reliability and executive
force.
BERKELEY. Aug. 11.â The first
complete and authoritative state
ment in regard to the success of
the system of public instruction
;n the Philippine Islands has just
come from Professor Bernard Moses of
thÂ© University of California, who return
ed to Berkeley to-day, after serving since
April, 1900, as a member of the Philip
pine Commission. Professor Moses goes
Into the various problems that have come
up in connection with the American ad
ministration in the islands, paying partic
ular attention to the questions on educa
tion, in which he was particularly con
cerned. Professor Moses was Secretary
of Public Instruction in the Philippines
under Governor Taft and formulated the
educational system that was adopted by
the commission. He vigorously defends
the policy of teaching English to the na
tive children, holding that this Is essen
tial in order that the race may come in
touch with Western institutions.
Coroner Mehrmann has charge of the
body and an inquest will be held to-mor
row evening.
Two days after his wedding in San
Francisco to Miss Wilhelmina S.
Schroeder. H. M. Williams, chief stew
ard of the steamship Algoa, disappeared.
To-day the missing bridegrooms body,
weighted with a bar of railroad iron,
Â¦was recovered from the bay by R. S.
Strabo. a sailor on the fhip Port Craw
ford lying at Long wharf.
The mystery of the disappearance Is
explained by a note written by Williams
to his your.g bride that was found in
his pocket by Deputy Coroner Quellen.
The me^sape wa-Â« In a most despondent
vein, and declared the writer's purpose
to end his life because cf ill health and
money troubles. The letter gives the so
lution to the story and indicates that
Williams was worrying over a transac
tion he had in San Francisco shortly
before he was married. It involves the
forgery of Captain Albert Lockett's name
to an order for $50 which B. H. Veeder,
a San Francisco water front outfitter,
rp.Fhed for Williams. Captain Lockett is
master of the Algca and Veeder went to
him last Tuesday with the order only
tn discover that the order" was forged.
B'lt the skipper remedied the matter by
accepting the order, signing it and telling
The outfitter that his steward was good
for the amount.
Apparently in worry about the transac
tion Williams, not kr.owirj? what had
been done to settle the matter, detrr
min#d to end his life. He wrote to his
wife the <*ay after they returned from a
two days' trip to Pan Jise after the
wedding, where they stayed at th* Hotel
Vendome. The farewell letter reads as
foUows:

The committee voted to request ths
Board of Education to grant the school
children a holiday on August 21, or if
that was impracticable to grant them a
half-holiday In the forenoon.
Chairman Evans appointed as a com
mittee on programme: II. B. Griffith of
Berkeley. Dr. T. Carpenter of Alameda,
John McCoy of Haywards. Colonel Hast
ings of San Leandro. Mayor Olney and
J..W. Evans of Oakland.
The total amount of the subscriptions
received up to date is $1615 25. This is
little more than half enough to defray
the expenses of the reception and the
members of the committee fear that the
programme will have to be curtailed un
less more, funds are forthcoming. Only
ten days now remain for preparation and
the soliciting committee is working hard
to secure the necessary amount.
At the meeting this afternoon Rev. J.

Does refusal to bathe constitute a
ground for divorce? The question will
be passed up to Judge Ellsworth for de
cision in an action begun to-day by Mrs.
Jennie Page against Rufus Page, a San
Leandro capitalist. Page, it Is alleged,
goes long periods without taking a bath,
all of which is repulsive to the finer sen
sibilities of his wife, and she wishes a
final separation from him and $130 a
month alimony.
Page's aversion to water is made the
subject of special mention in the com
plaint, which has been drawn up by At
torney J. E. McElroy. Not more than
six times a year, it states, does Page get
into a tub, although urged by his wife to
do so. Page's reason, as stated, is be
cause he is afraid of talcing cold, all of
which it is pleaded constitutes a species
of cruelty and good cause why Mrs. Paga
should be given a decree.
It is not the only ground upon which
the divorce is asked and it is said that
Page's miserly instincts go to the extreme
of buying poor meat in order to save th*
difference between an inferior quality anl
the price he would have to pay for a good
grade of meat.
Mrs. Page also alleges that he has not
bought her a dress since she promised t<>
be his bride, for better or for worse, tea
years ago. She once asked him for an al
lowance of J3 a month and he is quoted as
having told her she was crazy. It is al
leged that ho would only let her have
egga in the summer season, when the
price was low.
Judge Ellsworth has issued a restrain
ing order against Page to keep him from
disposing of any of hi3 property until
final disposition of the case is made. It
is alleged that he owns property to th<s
value of $30,000 or $40,000 and that a goodly
portion of it is invested In Spring Vallay
Water Company stock.

Woodside is charged with battery, but
his case was continued to-day in the Po
lice Court.
The parent laughs at the story of se
rious injury to his daughter. He insists
that his arrest and the trouble before it
Tvere more the outcome of general family
disturbances than any specific act of his.
On the other hand. Mrs. Woodside In
elsts that the girl was knocked senseless,
while Dr. Binehart comes to the fore
with the statement that Miss WoodsidÂ©
was puttering from concussion of the
brain and a partial paralysis of the left

The mother said:

her rÂ»n the head with *ueh force that ?he was
thrown Into eonvulFipn*. I pent for a physician
and then had my hlsbsnd arrested, because I
could stand his brutality no longer.
Concerning the trouble the accused
father said:
I was punishing my son Carl for misconduct
at school, when my daughter Grace made for
me with n. carving knife. I Mmply slapped her
face. TTiis trouble in duÂ» to general family
difficulty. I don't know what goes on around
the houÂ«e when I am away at work, and that's
all there is about It. The girl wasn't iÂ»erlou*ly
hurt because I talked to her after this thing
occurred.

ALAMEDA, Aug. 11.â With the decision
of the Citizens' Advlsorx. Committee last
night to' have prepared and presented to
the City Trustees an ordinance granting
to the Southern Pacific Company the two
franchises it seeks for its local roads, on
condition that the management of the
corporation accede to certain stipulations
embodied therein, there has come a lull in
the railroad agitation that has had Ala
meda by the ears for five weeks.
Acting upon the request of the Commit
tee of Fifty, the City Attorney is draft
ing an ordinance that will contain all of
the stipulations recommended by the ad
visory body. After the ordinance is in
troduced at the regular session of the
City Trustees next Monday night it will
be within the province of the municipal
legislators to amend, curtail and shape it
as they see fit. It is not expected that
the ordinance will be ready for passage
before the last meeting of the City Trus
tees In September. There will be sent to
thÂ© Southern Pacific officials a copy of
the ordinance as it will be Introduced next
Monday night, and it will then be in or
der for the representatives of the com
pany to conduct negotiations with the
City Trustees with the object of settling
the matter of the franchises to the mutual
satisfaction of the Southern Pacific and
the city of Alameda.
It is said that the stipulation requiring
the Southern Pacific to pay into the mu
nicipal treasury $500 a month for the priv
ileges conveyed In the franchises is what
has thus far prevented the representatives
of the corporation from coming to a defi
nite understanding with the representa
tives of Alameda. All of the other stipu
lations are of minor importance when
compared to this one. It was the sense
of the Committee of Fifty last night that
the corporation should be required to pay
something for the two franchises, and
that is the way the situation stands at
present. Whether the Southern Pacific
will consent to pay the $500 or whether
the management will endeavor to secure
the franchise free or for a lesser license
is not apparent at this time. It is proba
ble that the railroad people will desire
more conferences with the representatives
of the city on this stipulation. When the
Committee of Fifty adjourned last night
It did so to meet at the call of the chair.
The next move In the matter of the fran
chises will be made by the City Trustees
Monday nlpht.

At a recent banquet of the Chamber of Ship
ping, held In London and attended by GeraH
Balfour, Lord Bra* try, Earl Roberts and nu
merous other Britons of high rank, Kir James
L. Mackar. the. president of the chamber, paid
Â» tribute to the steamship Ooptlo, at present in
this port, and her commander. Captain Rlnder.
Addressing his remarks to W. J. Pirrie of the
directorate of thÂ» shipbuilding firm of Har
land & Wolfe Sir James said:
"I should like to mention, Mr. Plrrie, that
on a recent occasion, coming home from Chtna,
I traveled In one of your ships, not of the moct
recent type, but a veseci you will probably re
member having constructed some- twenty-three
years ago â a ehip by nam<Â» the Coptic. If ever
any of you gentlemen find you have to cross
the Paciflc I should strongly recommend you to
lay your plans "to that you may travel on thÂ«
Coptic, old as ehÂ» 1*. She Is a most excellent
vessel tn every possible way, and commanded
by a most excellent skipper. Captain Rlnder.
In the Coptic. Ftrange to say, old as she is.
there were absolutely no signs, of age. That
vessel seems to have been kept up. or so faith
fully built, that instead of looking twenty
three years old she does not look more than
ihrea."
Praise for the Coptic.

Navigation has not been so difficult in

present time.
SEATTLE. Aug. 1Lâ For two days the
freight steamship Alaskan has drifted
about the Pacific Ocean Just outside of
Cape Flattery unable to make the waters
or' Puget Sound on account of the dense
fog. Her local agents received word from
Tatoosh this morning that the vessel
would probably remain for an indefinite
period. It may be a week before the fog
clears sufficiently to make navigation
safe.
The Alaskan had about 500 tons of gen
eral merchandise for this port, having
made a call at San Francisco and other
California ports on her xvay north. She
has oade two round trips between Seat
tle and New York, touching at Honolulu,
end is now on her third voyage. She prob
ably is the largest of the company's fleet
and Captain Nichols will not take the
smallest chance of meeting with disaster

Captain Martin will communicate with
the Honolulu authorities and the Jap
anese will be held in prison till some
thing definite is ascertained from them
about him.
The police think they have a Japanese
In custody who is wanted in Honolulu
for murdering his wife about two months
ago. His name is Etaro Kimura and
he arrived here yesterday* morning as a
stowaway on the steamship Nebraskan.
As soon as the vessel was docked Cap
tain J. Green called at police headquar
ters and notified Captain Martin that aft
er the vessel was two days out from
Honolulu the. Japanese was discovered in
one of thÂ« coal bunkers. It was such
an unusual thing for a Japanese to be a
stowaway that the captain's suspicions
were-.; aroused, as he knew a reward of
$500 had been offered for the arrest of a
Japanese wife murderer.
Detective I Ryan accompanied Captain
Green to the steamer and took the Jap
anese to the City Prison. Interpreter
Geffeney was sent for, and he questioned
the Japanese, who made so many con
tradictory statements that the suspicion
that he wai the wife murderer was
strengthened. He said he had' been em
ployed in the California saloon in â¢ Hono
lulu and had not seen his wife for five
months, as they had quarreled .and she
had threatened to kill him. Then he said
his wife was living at King and Nuano

NEW YORK. Aug\ 11.â The prevailing sen
timent in Wall street to-day was much more
composed than for many days. The reassur
ing effect of the greater stability or prices es
tablished by yesterday's measures of support
was wen In the encouragement expressed In
various quarters that protection for the markft
against demoralization would be forthcoming
If nctdf-d. There was a frellnsr that the worst
liquidation may be regarded as completed and
that the absorptive power of the market may
be expected to Increase after a period of rc-
Mnance to further decline, the dread of which
is obviously kecking many purchasers out Of
the market. It is believed that then- will bÂ«;
Important absorption of stocks by capitalists
of large means, who pursue the j*>llcy of buy
ing at intervals the stork* of whose value" they
are satisfied. Not so much Importance waa
attached to reports that recent large withdraw
als of savings bank deposits had been for the
purpose of Investment in stocks. This is a
source from which very little is expected In the
way of stock buying as a rule. Some of the
recent withdrawals of pavings have been at
tributed to the demand for llvlnc expenses dur
ing the prevalence of strikes. There was, how
ever, a conspicuous number of email transac
tions, or those In "odd lots," meaning less than
100 ehares. which is the unit form of liquida
tion on the Stock Exchange. This buying m
lots of ten to fifty shares was attributed to
small Investment buying, and was fairly well
distributed among paying stocks. This is a
class of business that stock commission houses
give small heed to in time of ordinary strength
in the market. But the sentimental effect at
present is considerable. Some of the Indus
trials on which the rate of return Is inviting
shared in thiÂ» kind of demand. .When prices
started upward there was pressure developed to
Fell, whicfi was attributed to those who bought
stocks yesterday for purposes of support and
who had no desire to hold them. But the
downward movements failed to awaken the kind
of nervousness that has been witnessed for some
time past and they served to demonstrate the ex
istence of buying orders below the market which
served as a prop. The Increase In the dividend
rate on Canadian Pacific was shown In the
opening rise cf 1*4 In that stack. | n which an
uneasy short Interest exists. " But there was
clearly no present intention to squeeze the
shorts. This was accepted with satisfaction
u it Is feared that anything like the working
of a comer would be as discomfiting to the
market as a decline in prices. The Government
crop report was a favorable factor In general.
The corn carriers themselves were affected by
attempts to market shares on the strength of
ine crop showing. The chances of damage by
frost to a late crop are also held in mind.
There were persistent rumors that the stock
Increase of St. Paul would soon be issued but
there was no official sanction for these reports
Encouraged by the good resistance, the whole
market "turned strong tn the last hour and rose
to the best of the day and closed strong at
about the top level.
There wÂ«re some sharp advances In bonds
late In the flay, but the other Issues . failed to
share in the late recovery. Total sales (par

actions thus far made. Growers are firm in
their views, ar.d buyers are not disposed- to
speculate a*, heavily as for a few weeks back,
hence business is not very active. This indis
position to speculate is a good thing for the
market, as it Indicates stabler quotations later
on, based more on the legitimate law of supply
and demand. Selling for future delivery leads
the seller to break the market afterward so
that he can make his deliveries, hence, while
short selling makes an active market at first
off, - it results in a lower market later on.

generally of rood qualitj-. and hay is li^ht.
Sugar beets, beans and corn are doing well.
Hops are not In very satisfactory condition and

Grain hÂ«rv*-*t is completed In some sections
and progre**lr.r rapidly In others. Wheat, bar-
JeT oats and hay are excellent crops In near
ly" all sections. Sugar beets at Anaheim are
reported light, but there Is a heavy crop In
the Kanta Maria district. The bean crop will

GENERAL SUMMARY.
The Weather and Crops.
Late mall reports from New York say:
"The market on the Coast continued to show
an ad\-anclng tendency. B}ds were reported
freely made of 17Â«jl7*tc for choice 1902 Ore
gons and It was stated up to lfce was paid for
them. There was a fair Inquiry from some deal
Â«Â¦!-Â» to contract for 190.J heps, but they met
with little success In making purchases, grow,
ers peneially showing confidence in the future
and were net disposed to contract. According
to latest calculations the rtocic cf 19U2 hops
remaining In first hands en the coast have
been reduced to cot over 70<iO bales. No
rhamrrs in the crop situation on the coast
were reported and latest <stlmates placed the
Oregon crop at 75,000 bales. California at 43,
<Â«Vi bales and Washington at 83,000 bales, a
total of IK.'**) tales. Crop news from up the
State was u+ni rally favorable. The mark<t
for 19<.!2 ho]>s was firm with light offerings
due to scarcity. No ntw developments were
reported from abroad. Locally tbe market
showed a hardening tendency. reflecting
rtronger advices from primal markets. A
snail trade was made between dealtrs at
y-c for choice OreÂ£ons."

CHICAGO, Aug. 11.â Wheat opened firm on
the Government crop report, which was : con
strued as moderately bullish, and September
was a shade lower to *6@*4e - higher at the
start at 70%Â©80*4c. Local traders were dis
posed to sell on the small advance, which
resulted In an easier tone, September selling
off to 797i@70%c, but with a strong corn
market prices soon rallied again a:vd Septem
ber advanced to 80%c. Some of the large in
terests that were such persistent sellers yes
terday were again on that side of the mar
ket and on the least show of strength, the
selling pressure became so great that a re
action always followed. During the last hour
the market became quite weak and September
declined to 7(>%c. closing at fiOcâ a shade
higher than yesterday's close.
Unseasonably cool weather throughout the
corn belt caused firmness In corn in spite, of
the bearish construction placed upon the crop
report. Opening prices were easier, but a
good demand from prominent bull operators,
who were Influenced by the fears of early
frosts, soon caused a rally and the market
became quite strong. The late weakness in
wheat, however, had a depressing effect, and
all of the early strength was lost, the close
being at about yesterday's figures, with Sep
tember a shade lower at 52%c, after selling
between 61%c and 52%c.
Oats ruled firm, despite the fact that the
Government report was In some respects bear
ish. Local bulls were active buyers of the
distant months and there was little on the
market at any time. After seillnc between
34VÂ«c and SJ'iic, September closed Â»,4c higher
at 34*4c
Provisions were firm at the etart on buying
by foreigners, but In the absence of specu
lative Interest the market gradually turned
easy. September pork closed 5Â®7 J ,ic lower.
Lard unchanged and ribs were off 5c.

Trading in fruits was ' active and prices of
most descriptions were steady. There was a
good demand for good hard Peaches, wrapped
Bartlett Pears and crated Plums for shipment
on the Portland steamer, and occasional lots
of those description* commanded a premium
over the quotations. Receipts of Pears from
the river were light, and as trashy stock was
well cleaned up. prices were steady for choice
and firmer for . No. 2. Offerings In wrappers
from Martinez were firm at the top quotation.
Peaches In baskets from the river were offer-
Ing freely, but were weak, owing to the abund
ance and low prices of superior . quality offer-
Ings from other sections. Apples were fairly
steady for fancy, but dull for lower grades,
with stocks large and steadily . accumulating.
There were moderate receipts of Flga from
Sonoma and offerings cleaned up promptly. Ap
ricots were firmer under decreased receipts. The
market was overstocked with Melons and prices
ranged lower. Choice offerings of Grapes sold
well for shipping at full figures, but the gen
eral run ' of supplies were poor and sour and
moved slowly in consequence. Seedless were
the most plentiful and the top quotation was
obtained for fine offerings from Hanford. Some
40-lb boxes of the Sweetwater variety arrived
from Martinez and sold at $1 per box. There
was not much demand for Blackberries. Straw
berries or Raspberries, but as receipts were
light prices were maintained. Huckleberries
were firmer and well cleaned up.
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The receipt of Potatoes wen? light again and
the market recovered "some of the strength lost
on thÂ»- preceding day. There was a fair in
quiry for fhipplng stock and the local demand
for "fancy offerings continued steady. Buyers
are paying more along the â¢ nver for common
stock than could be obtained In this market,
hence the light receipts. Sweets were steady.
The top quotation was obtained for choice of
ferings from Stockton. Onions were easier,
but moved off well.
Receipts of vegetables, while amnle, were
less liberal than usual and prices of several
descriptions ranged higher. Tomatoes were In
light receipt and prices had a sharp advance,
and the market closed firm at the maximum
quotation. Choice Green Corn was in good
demand and occasional lots sold over the quo
tations, some special brands in sacks selling
up to $2. \ Peas and Beans were steady and
Cucumbers and Summer Squash moved freely
at firmer rates. Green Peppers and Okra were
abundant and continued - weak. . Marrowfat

WHEAT FREIGHTSâ Spot rates, usual^ Eu
ropean options., are about 15a for large and 16s
@15s 3d for small carriers, the market for this
business being 'quiet. The chartered Wheat
fleet in port has a registered tonnage of 43,684.
against 65,940 tons on the same date last year;
disengaged, 05,400 tons, against 44,200; o* thÂ«
way to this port, 338.000 tons, against 243,100.
WHEAT â The foreign markets show little
change. Paris futures are lower.
Chicago remained about the same and re- 1
ported the local longs dumping their Wheat.
The Chicago wires of Bolton. de Ruyter &. Co.
said: "Market dull and a shade easier. Spec
ulative options were mainly local and on a
small scale. Kansas City reports an active de
mand for cash Wheat and St. Ix>uis says their
cash market is rather dull. Export demand
still small. Primary receipts continue very
much less than last year, and Southwestern
reports country offerings below expectations.
The Government report indicates a crop of
about 630,000,000 bushels, or about 45,000,000
less than last year.' To produce this result it
estimates an Increase In acreage of six and a
half millions. which is absurd. Either
the acreage was too small* last year or too
great this year. Last year's crop has been
practically -all- consumed. The London Statist
estimates European requirements of 10,000,0uO
bushels per week for the current year, and
says that the consumption of wheat has been
greatly increased. These conditions make us
feel strong en Wheat and we advise its pur
chase on the weak spots."
This market continued weak. Farmers and
other Interior holders are asking about 25c per
ton over the following quotations and the buy
ers In theli turn are holding oft, so business Is
duller than It has been. Futures are lower.

MRS. PHIL LEWIS. .
MRS. MILTON A. NATHAN.President Wheeler announced that the
new physiology building- on- the Berkeley
campus would, be dedicated on August
20, Professor William Ostwald of Berlin
being present to deliver the address.- He
also announced -the resignation " of T. . L.
Heaton from the . department of educa
tion and recommended that he be re
tained as lecturer- at a salary of $200 a
year. : '
The following, students of the college
of mediqlne were granted the degree of
M. D.: Madeleine Johns, Charles L. Mc-
Kown, Mark L. Miner and Sydney V.
West.
The resignation of Dr. W. B. Lewett
from the chair of the principle and prac
tice of surgery at the dental college and
the recommendation of Dr. J. O. Sharpe
and Dr. Charles Litton to fill vacancies
in that department, were announced. J.
E. McComas was appointed patron of
the Pomona Agricultural Experiment
Station without salary. Conrad Lorlng,
an assistant In the college of civil en
gineering at Berkeley on a salary of $720,
was promoted to. the grade of Instructor
at $300. Dr. Bruce B. Hill of Grlnnell
College, Iowa, was appointed to fill' the
vacancy in" the department of physics
left by the resignation of Professor *G.
K. Burgess. ' *
Besides this pressing affair the board
settled other routine business. President
Wheeler reported that Amelia Bi Pixley,
deceased, had left In trust ?3563 22 to be
created Into a scholarship. known as the
Frank M. Pixley scholarship. He also
announced the receipt - of the annual
scholarship of 5125 from the San Jose
High School.
CHANGES IN STAFF.
Finally McEnerney introduced a motion
that the old college site, valued at $5000.
be immediately , sold. If thls^ could - not
be 'accomplished to advantage, the Pot
rero lots wore to be sold for not less than
$66,000. In case of a failure of this pro
ject also, the board was to advance the
necessary sum to keep the college In ses
sion until next June, the amount being
debited against the Toland endowment
This, however, with the understanding
that in no way was the action to be con
strued as an admission by the regents of
their financial responsibility for the med
ical college. By June that. question Is to
be settled definitely. . ' '
Regent Foster stated that only a* few
years ago the college was run by a close
corporation of medical practitioners of
this eitv and tltat the Board of Regents
never had much faith In it. He advised
that the regents immediately decide
whether or not .they desired to keep the
college In affiliation before they compro
mised themselves.
"We acreed at that time," said Rein- |
stein "that there bhould be absolutely no
distinction made against the medical de
partment. There can be no question now
of whether or not we support the col
lPRe; that has been settled.
â¢â¢The university is paying money into
the departments of physiology, pathology
and anatnmv and should assist the de
partment of medicine. For the honor of
the donor who gave the university every
dollar for the support of this school we
Bhould imt kill the school and use the
funds for other purposes."
Regent McEnerney then broke in:
"We evidently have all been asleep for
ihe rast years or there have been In
serted in tne minutes motions which we
never heard of. It is ridiculous for us
to proceed upon the assumption that the
medical school is self-supporting when
it manifestly is not. I-et us come right
out and either abolish tho medical depart
ment or support It entirely."
McEnerney then suggested that the old
Tciand Moflical College building *ite. val
ued at t'jyOO, be 6old, together with the
lots, if any action at all was taken, ibut
he advised delay.
Regent Charles S. Wheeler then took a
hand in the Intricate problem.
"Tins is a crisis." he said, "which we
must m^et immediately. The school is
already $4Wl or -$5000 in arrears. Within
a week new students will be ready to
enter the college. If the institution Is
insolvent at the start we will never have
to dee'de on its status; it will be non
existent."
Carmen Swear Spouses
Supplied Money to
Build.
It is very evident that the members of
the Carmen's Union, judging from their
action yesterday in the arbitration pro
ceedings now pending between that body
and the United Railroads, believe that
there are two sides to every story.
When Attorney Moore for the United
Railroads was presenting his case in gen
eral in the arbitration proceedings he
filed the sworn statements of several
hundred carmen, who claimed to have
paved money from their earnings on the
road. Yesterday there was a decided re
versal of form. LJvernash came into
court armed with several hundred af
fidavits signed by the very same carmen,
who swore that they could not save a
cent of the money they were earning.
Livernash, as a preliminary, said that
the carmen, when they swore to the state
ments which were collected by the United
Railroad officials, never for a moment
thought that these very documents would
be used by the street car corporation
against them. In their case. Then Llver
nash commenced to read the statements
and to each one Attorney Moore would
hunt up the writer'^ original affidavit,
which would be quite different.
The comparisons between the two were
ludicrous. Some explained that the
money that they swore to possess they
earned before they became benedicts.
Others made their little surplus cash by
working as election officers, while others,
more fortunate, had married wives with
funds and through their faithful spouses'
kindly offices had become the possessors
of their own homes. One man more can
did than tho rest said he had saved $1400
to pay for his home by saving every cent
and by depriving himself of every lux
ury. He wound up his statement by say-
Ing that he would not go through the
same experience again for fourteen
homes. ~i~'-~i":''
This action on the part of the carmen
nonplused the counsel for the United
Railroads and it will lie solely with the
board of arbitration to take a choice and
decide which of the affidavits of the car
men they wish to accept.
The hearing of testimony will be con
tinued this morning at 10 o'clock.
St. Paul Arrives.
The Alaska Commercial Company's steam
ahlp St. Paul, Captain E. E. Llndquist, arrived
yesterday from Nome and Seattle. She brought
about forty paswengerB and gold dust valued at
$130,235 90. She also had on board a valuable
consignment of furs. Captain John G. Blair,
who left here on the St. Paul for the- round
trip, came home looking ten years younger.
Mrs. Ltndqnist and two children, the wife and
family of the St. Paul's captain, were also
passengers.

Robert A. Sample, the special police
man .who â¢ was shot twice In the head on
Folsom street, near Second," early yester
day morning, was removed from, the
Harbor Hospital to * his home at 4330
Twenty-third street yesterday. One of
the bullets was extracted at the hospital,
but the other, which. is supposed to have
lodged at the base of the skull, could not
be definitely located. It is fea*Â»d that this
bullet has fractured the skull, which will
render his recovery improbable.
It appears that Charles Sullivan and
John H. Powell, the two young men who
were arrested by Policemen Clark and
Nobmann, were beating Thomas Delehan
ty of 319 Fremont street at First and Clem
entina streets and Sample was notified of
the fact by Martin Kelly. Sample went
there and ordered Sullivan and Powell
away. They walked along Folsom street
toward Second, and stepped into a dark
doorway. Sample followed them and told
them to go home and not get into more
trouble. Powell jumped out of the door
way and â¢ struck Sample, who drew hla
club , and hit Powell. Sullivan pulled
Sample to the ground, took his revolver
from him and fired two shots at his head,
both bullets taking effect.
Chief Wittman was so favorably im
pressed with the action of Motorman W.
H. Beckman and Conductor I. Watson of
car. 1005 of the Folsom-street line that he
sent the following letter yesterday to G.
F. Chapman, general' manager of the
United Railroads:
At 12:35 this morninjr Special Police Officer
Robert A. Sample was twice shot and mortally
wounded by two ruffians whom he was en
deavoring to arrest on Folsom street, near Sec
ond. Officers Nobmann and Clark arrived on
the scene immediately after the shooting, and
they report to me that the motorman and con
ductor of car No. 1005 of the Folsom-street
line allowed them to place the wounded officer
on their car and returned with him to the Har
bor Receiving Hospital, where the men who had
assaulted him were brought Into his presence,
thus enabling the officers to have them Identi
fied, aÂ»-d also to procure a statement from the
wounded officer before he lapsed into uncon
sciousness.
Regent Relnsteln then called upon Pres
ident Wheeler to state if this --was tho
status upon which the medical college
rested. When "President Wheeler declared
that such- was the case, Reinstein flatly
contradicted him with the assertion that
two years ago he made the motion, which
was accepted, to th'e effect that the medi
cal department should be considered on
the same plane as any of the depart
ments at Berkeley. /
REINSTEIN OBJECTS.
When Regent Foster of the finance com
mittee announced the adverse report upon
this proposition Regent Phoebe Hearst in
quired what was to become of the medi
cal department. Foster then replied that
when the Toland Medical College was af
filiated with the University of California
there was a distinct understanding on the
part of the regents that the college was
endowed, self-supporting and relying in
no way upon the larger institution for
financial assistance.
This Important action was precipitated
by the adverse report of the finance com
mittee on the recommendation of the
committee on medical status. This com
mittee approved the plea of the manage
ment of the medical college that the re
gents either sell the property located in
the Potrero, which is. part of the endow
ment of the college, or advance them
$66,000, the reputed value of the property,
out of the general treasury of the uni
versity.
ADVERSE BEPORT MADE.
.The affiliated college 'of. medicine of the
University of California is In imminent
danger of . passing completely out of ex
istence. After a long and acrimonious
debate yesierday afternoon the" board of
regents of the State University decided to
relieve the financial distress threatening
the life of the college as a matter .of final
resource,' but to decide within a year
whether to allow the medical department
to exist as a branch of the university or
sever all connection with the institution.
The paramount issue with the regents
was the financial status upon which the
medical department rests. A part of the
body, headed by Kegent Reinstein, main
tained that the medical college was to be
considered as a department of the univer
sity similar to any at Berkeley and re
lying for support upon the university
treasury. On the other hand, Regent Mc-
Encrney and a strong faction declared
that the college of medicine was affiliat
ed with the university on a self-support
ing basis- and advocated its immediate ex
tinction if such proved not the case.
As a compromise it was finally agreed
that the college doors should be kept
open for the next year upon the funds
accruing from the sale of prqperty left
it as an endowment by the late Dr. To
land; if such sales could not be made ad
vantageously the requisite funds to be ad
vanced by the regents. But this motion
was only passed on the strict understand
ing that the university was not to go on
record as being in any way the financial
s"upporter of that department.
The will of Franklin Heywood, the
lumberman who committed suicide July
29, of .this year, was filed for probate yes
terday. The will, which *is a typewritten
document bearing the names of three wit
nesses, was made just twenty-four days
before the death of deceased. W. B. and
Walter Heywood, brothers of the de
ceased, and H. A. Powell, the lumber
man, are named as executors. The docu
ment directs that the estate of the de
ceased, which is worth $250,000, shall be
held In trust by them until the death of
Agnes B. Hevwood, wife of the testa
tor, from whom he saparated many years
ago. They are directed to pay to her
$150 a month during her lifetime, the sum
settled upon her at the time of the sepa
ration, and a similar sum to Agnes Maud
Heywood. the adopted daughter of de
ceased. Upon the death of Mrs. Heywood
the executors shall give to the adopted
daughter nne-half of the estate and di
vide the other half between Charles, Sam
uel. W. B., Walter and Harry Heywood,
brothers of the deceased, and Hattie G.
Hunt, a sister, and C. W. and Irene Phil
lips, a nephew' and a niece. The two last
named are to divide one-seventh of half
the estate between them, and the broth
ers and sister are to receive _ the other
six-sevenths, share and share alike. The
will also directs that the executors shall
pay to J. A. Temple $30 a month dur
ing his lifetime. H. A. Powell is left
the gold watch of deceased. F. M. Trow
er. Heywood's secretary, is left $2000, and
the Heywood residence, its contents and
the horses^ind equipages of the testator
are specifically bequeathed to the adopted
daughter.
In the event of the death of the adopted
daughter before Mrs. Heywood her share
will, under the will, go to the brothers
and sister and nephew an'd niece in equal
shares.
