having collected an additional $50 on each

that the law authorized him to make this

Bade. The Grand Army man conjectured
that the negro would return and he im

Half an hour later Hewston reappeared,
and, after renewing the quarrel, drew a

charge of heavy shot entering the negro's
Eide. He fell to the ground and for sev

ROME, Sept. 10.â Professor Carderelli.
the eminent physician, who is a member
of the Senate, publishes in the Rlvlsta
d'ltalla to-day a long article to demon
strate that Pope Leo XIII died of tuber
culous cancer or right hydrothorax. He
fortifies hia . statement with arguments
based on his own experience and that of
authorities such as Trousseau, Barth,
Franker and Zagari, to show that all the
symptoms of the Illness of Pope Leo as
stated in bulletins by Drs. Lapponl and
Mazzonl lead to the conclusion that the
late Pope was not affected by pleurisy or
pleuro-pneufonia. Profesor Carderelli
affirms that from the moment blood liquid
appears in the pleura and is found
through thoracentesis, especially when
the lluid gathers deceitfully without pain
or fever or manifest cause of pleurisy,
the diagnosis of pleurisy must be exclud
ed, and that when the liquid forms In
the right pleura it usually indicates can
cer or hydrothorax in aged people. There
are forms of senile pleurisy or pneumonia,
he continues, In* which fever, pain and
cough are lacking, but these are almost
without exception of a tuberculous na
ture. The declaration that the post mor
tem examination confirmed the diagno
sis made by Drs. Lapponi and Mazzoni,
the professor declares, is not sufficient,
as only careful microscopic examination
in these cases can establish the real af
fection of the pleura.
The professor'* statement consludes as
follows;
Herir.atlc Berum gathered deceitfully with
out fever, pain or cough In an Ola man of 94,
with diminishing strength, should have made
the doctors think of cancer of the pleura or
tuberculous hydrothorax instead of pleurisy,
pieuro-pneumonia or senile pulmonary nepati
tation. but it is impossible to make a diagno
sis without havlnsr seen the patient and with
out precise data on the chemical nature of the
composition of the liquid taken from the pleura.
Faithful to a high pledge taken. I have waited
forty days from the death of the Pope before

LONDON, Sept. 10. â "Europe is stand
ing on the edge of a precipice/' said
a diplomatist who Is participating in
the international negotiations in connec
tion with the Balkan question, "and no
one can tell but that to-morrow may see
Turkey and Bulgaria plunged into war
in spite of all the efforts made to prevent
it. and though the powers separately have
made strong representations to Bulgaria
to deeist from aiding the insurgents and
are on the eve of making a joint demand
for the observance of a policy of strict
neutrality. In the meantime Turkev is
becoming encouraged by the attitude of
the powers toward Bulgaria, and there is
a strong feeling among the Mohammedans
that the opportunity Is at hand to take
summary vengeance on the Bulgarian
peopie. The Porte has been warned
against engaging in war, and we believe
hesitates to embark on a move which
may result in the armed intervention of
Europe. The, only encouraging sign In
the situation is the understanding between
the powers, all of which we are sure are
upholding Russia and Austria in their ef
forts to maintain peace. '
All of the advices, official and otherwise,
received here agree in saying that the
Turkish Government has noy restored
quiet at Beirut and that the rorte appre
ciates the neceslty for taking action In
the matter, as shown by the removal of
the vali of Beirut, as demanded by United
States'Minister Leishman.
So far as can be learned, though the
powers are prepared to send ships at a
moment's notice to Salonica, In compli
ance with the reported request of the Con
suls, no orders for warships to sail have
yet been issued. Confidence Is expressed
that should Mich action be taken it will
be in concert.
No confirmation has been obtained of
the report published by Die Zeit of Vien
na to-day that Turkish troops have been
ordered to cross the Bulgarian frontier of
Eastern Roumanla, on the coming full
moon nights. In order to surround all the
Insurgent bands In the vilayet of Adrian
ople, but It would not be surprising if. In
spite of orders to the contrary, Turkish
troops pursuing insurgent bands should
cross the frontier, and this would precipi
tate a conflict between the Turks and Bul
garians. -L: -?';'

Cologne â ThÂ« court-martial of the Fifteenth
Division has sentenced Sergeant Schott to a
year in prison and degradation for flogging
privates and horsewhipping and kicking them.
Twelve artillerymen were sentenced to short
terms for assisting him.
There have been eighty convictions of
sergeants for abuse of privates during: the
last three months and about 20 courts
martial are pending.
The administration of the army ig mak
ing the most determined efforts to stop
these brutalities, which Herr Bebel, the
Socialist leader, detailed in a ferocious
three hours' speech In the Reichstag In
the spring. The weak reply of General
von Gossler on the following day probably
cost him his place as Minister of War.
It has long been the theory of military
men that a little rough treatment Was
gefod for privates and cultivated manhood
in them. The Emperor never shared these
views nor countenanced the cruelties prac
ticed in nearly every regiment. He is
sued an order most emphatically forbid
ding the ill-treatment of privates and or
dering the prosecution and severe punish
ment of those guilty of such ill-treatment.

A committee representing all classes
has been organized by the professors of
the Sofia University and is sitting daily
to discuss the situation. Bitter attacks
en Prince Kerdinand are indulged in for
his action in dissolving the Sobranje at
such a critical moment, which is charac
terized as treason against Uie people.
Resolutions will be submitted to this
committee urging the immediate mobiliza
tion of the army against Turkey.
The Daily Telegraph's correspondent at
Sofia, in a long resume of the situation,
points out that Bulgaria does not pos-
EfEs sufficient troops to properly cordon
the frontier. She has only posts of five
men each at points thrc-Â« miles distant
from one another, and as the Turkish
frontier guards always retire when they
fcee Bulgarian bands crossing the latter
have an easy task. The correspondent
thinks this points to the conclusion that
the Ottoman Government desires to keep
the insurrection alive as a pretext for the
annihilation of the Christiana, and as the
Bulgarians are unlikely to remain Inac
tive spectators of the massacte of their
brethren the current of popular feeling
may easily become too strong for any
Government to withstand. Even in the
liulgarian army and administration there
is strong Fympathy for the Macedonians,
and in these services there is also a. large
percentage of Macedonians. Hitherto, by
promising European Intervention and sup
pressing the details of the Turkish atroc
ities, the Government has succeeded in
cllaying popular indignation, but such
temporary expedients can no longer avail,
and nothing short of international Inter
vention can dispel the storm clouds now
fast gathering.

is ascribed as the cause for her deed.
As soon as the train could be stopped

Less than an hour before she ended her

as it reached the spot where she had

SAN JOSE. Sept. 10.â Murder, suicide
and arson formed the culmination of a
Japanese love affair In this city this
forenoon. The murder may be double, for
one of the victims of the Impetuous lover
is at the point of death. The Japanese
boarding-house of S. Tahnchl and wife,
at 49 Cleveland avenue, was the scene
of the crime. Mrs. T. Tahnchl, on whom
the murderous lover tried to force his at
tention, and J. Kudow, the murderer and
suicide, occupy slabs In the morgue.
Tahnchi, the woman's Husband, ,1a in the
Red Cross Sanitarium, where the doctors
are trying to save his life.
The crime was committed shortly be
fore 10 o'clock. Tahnchl and bis wife
had conducted a Japanese boarding-house
in the Sixth-street Chinatown for years.
They were quiet, respectable people, and
had accumulated considerable money. A
trip to their former home in Japan was
to be made shortly and they had pre
pared for the Journey by purchasing large
quantities of the finest clothing.
Kudow is believed to have been a Jap
anese laborer, although but little 19
known of him. He had made frequent
trips to this city and came here again
last night. He was smitten with Mrs.
Tahnchi and proposed to her that she
leave her husband and elope with him.
The woman refused and then it was that
the man planned the double murder and
suicide.
Kudow called at the house this morn
ing. Just what occurred is not known,
but from the position of the bodies It Is
believed -he called Mrs. Tahnchl out into
th# hall. She was shot twice and her
body was found in the hall. The husband
of the woman at the â¢ beginning of the
shooting had evidently ran into the back
yard to get help. Kudow followed him
and shot him in the center of the back

The auestion whether the conference
should entertain the charges and the
method of procedure if they were en

notice of the charges had not been given,
but after a full consideration and with
the consent of Dr. Hammond sufficiency
of notice was waived. It was decided to
entertain the charges and they were or

SAN RAFAEL, Sept. 10.â As the result
of the , burning of a portion of trestle
No. 20 on the North Shore Railroad all
rail communication with points north of
San Ansclmo Junction was cut off for
many hours to-day.
Had it not been for the watchfulness
of Engineer Canady last night the com
pany would have to record another dis
astrous wreck. Canady, in making his
up-country run with ten cars "dead
heading" to Cazadero, noticed the bridge
on fire and stopped the train just in
time to keep it from plunging into a
ravine fifty feet below.
The fire was discovered about 9:30
o'clock. The regular down-country ex
press train - from Cazadero and a picnic
train with 1500 excursionists from Camp
Taylor had passed over the bridge but a
short time before the blaze became no
ticeable.
Canady's train was ascending White
Hill grade and had near'.y reached the
summit. That portion of the road is
very circuitous and on account of the
heavy incline the locomotive was run
ning slowly. Five trestles have to be
gone over and on approaching the last
one Canady noticed a light below the
track. On reaching the bridge he could
see it was on fire. He immediately back
ed, notified Conductor de Sella and the
train crew went to the scene. One of the
crew crossed the bridge, walked through
the tunnel and on to- White Hill telegraph
station, a distance of a mile, where Oper
ator Walter Sharp was awakened and the
railroad* officials in Sausallto were noti
fied. Superintendent Fisher at once or
dered out a wrecking train. The fire was
extinguished after about fifty feet of the
trestle had been consumed.
The cause of the fire is not known, but
seme ascribe it to incendiarism.

St. Louis is fast becoming one of the largest
commercial and manufacturing centers bf the
world, and has therefore much of interest to
visitors aside from the coming World's Pair.
It has a number of mercantile houses and
manufactories ranking first in their respective
lines, the name and fame of which have spread
throughout civilization. v Â°
Probably none other of these will appeal so
strongly to sightseers, . from points both of im
mensity and general interest, as. will 'the plant
of, the Anheuser-Busch Brewing. Ass'n When
in 1865. Mr. Adolphus Busch took charge of the
concern which was then known under the flrm
name of B. Anheuser & Co., it was one of the
smallest of its line In this country, but under
Mr. Busch's skillful guidance Its business in
creased phenomenally. New buildings sprune
up like mushrooms, but on foundations as
strong as fortresses, so that now the handsomo
red brick buildings, trimmed with granite^and
white stone, present a beautiful city In them
selves. From an output of 8000 barrels In 18Â«J5
its sales Increased to more than a million bar
rels per year in less than forty years.
However, the keystone to the success of this
great establishment was Budwelser, which on
account of Its rare mellowness, fine flavor and
exquisite taste, immediately became a favorite
among the beer-drinking people at all points of
the globe, and now by far exceeds in sales anv
other brand of bottled beer.- .

GIOCONDA GIVEN
WARM RECEPTION
Miss Roberts Triumphs
in D'Annunzio's
"Gioconda," by Gabriels d'Annunzio,
and translated by Arthur Symons, was
presented yesterday afternoon at'the'Al
cazar by Miss Florence Roberts, who
appeared as Silvia Settala.
First of 'all, Frederic Belasco is to
bo heartily congratulated for the pains
taking manner in which the produc
tion was given. Every detail that tends
to the success of a performance from a
scenic point of. view had evidently been
carefully studied and caried out, which
fact an immense and representative au
dience was not slow to acknowledge.
The play "Gioconda" is absolute in its
emotion and in its sentiment and ven
tures on the verge of melancholia.
Throughout, the recitation of the attempt
ed suicide of Silvia's husband, Lucio, the
sculptor, because of his passion for hi3
beautiful model, Gioconda Dianti, the
development of the play is as a gloomy
pall.'-whlch along four acts darkens and
darkens until the glooms actually become
intense. :.'^ ; ,' -" > i -"".' : '.' m ; Â»^-- --"RV,<
i EVEKLASTINO SHADOW.
â¢There are poets who sing the sent!
mental, poets whose song thrills- witl
'light and merry note and ; poets who moai
in dirgeful morbidness, and Gabriel*
d'Annunzio belongs to the latter class
He chants and moans in the minor. Then
Is the everlasting shadow, shadow, shad
ow until the very , last act, when La
Sirenetta brings a smile and a flitting
beam on the dark gloom
Lucio proves convincingly by wofel anc
action that he Vcannot free his soul ex
cept by tearing herâ Giocondaâ from his
heart," and he becomes so persistent ir
that declaratlon,~in face of the fact thai
he has been rescued from the clutch ol
prim death by, his faithful Silvia, that on<
actually loses -every particle of patience
and regrets that the sweet, much-tried
confiding wife should be willing to ~suffei
further anguish. .
Miss Florence Roberts did nobly with
the part of Silvia Settala, and since the
doleful composer allows no latitude foi
the actor to escape the minor key, Â¦ It fs
truly remarkable how the Interest \t
maintained. Miss Roberts gave a per
formance that adds to her previous long
list of successes and nothing could more
plainly attest to this than the almost
appalled interest of the audience through
out four acts.
Lucius Henderson had the thankless
role, Lucio Settala, and infused into the
translation a quantity of emotion which
is indispensable if the lines are to be re
spected by the Interpreter.
MOUNTING ELABORATE.
"William Yerance, too, gave a capita
performance In the 'part of Lorenzo Gad
di, and Harry S. Hilllard's Cosimo Dalbc
was most agreeably presented. Miss
Edith Angus played the part of Fran
cesca Doni with admirable judgment and
grace, and it fell to Miss Bertha Blanch
ard as Gioconda to sound the. first strong
dramatic note when in the third act shÂ«
â¢ meets the wife of : the sculptor for whon:
she has been the model for the work intc
which he has- put blood and life and

CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., Sept. lO.-The
great compressor of the La Belle Power
Company at Goldfleld, furnishing light to
several towns of the district and com
pressed air to several mines, started In
motion this morning for the first time
since the -.trike was declared forcing air
into the Golden Cycle, Vindicator, Find
ley, Theresa and Christmas mines and
several of the smaller leases that recently
started operations. The shift that start
ed the machinery In motion was composed
entirely of new men, none of the old em
ployes having reported for duty. The
plant is completely surrounded by caval
ry and infantry.
VICTOR, Colo.. Sept. 10.â Michael Rog
ers, a miner living at Cameron, has dis
appeared and his cabin has been burned.
The fire is generally presumed to have
been of an incendiary origin. Rogers is
known by the authorities to have been the
only man who saw the assault on James
M. Stewart, the carpenter, ten days ago.
' The man iound dead near Clyde v/ith a
bullet hole in his body has been identified
as Patrick Burns, a . railroad laborer.
Whether he was murdered or accidentally
shot is undetermined, but It Is evident that
the shooting had no connection with the
strike or the presence of the military In
the camp. . .
C. E. Kennison, president of the District
Miners' Union No. 1, was struck in the
face and knocked down on a car this
morning by a non-union miner, who was
on his way to work after a heated argu
ment between the two men. Kennison
drew a revolver, but was disarmed before
he could shoot.
Kennison was arrested and placed In jail
this afternoon on a charge of carrying a
concealed weanon. ' H e said:
"I am guilty of the offense charged. 1
carried a weapon for the sole purpose of
'defending my life. The guards at the
Elisor mine said they would stretch me
up to an electric light pole. I was brutal
ly assaulted this morning and I drew a
revolver in defense of my life."
TELLURIDE. Colo., Sept. lO.-The situ
ation here is quiet. Fifty men left the
camp to-day, mostly for Colorado points.
All the Ophir properties are still working.
Manager Buckley of the Ophir Consoli
dated met a union committee and agreed
to the wage scale with the exception of
the clause compelling working three shifts
in certain cases. r~- orley proposed a
slight change satisfactory to the commit
tee but which must be ratified by the
union. A meeting of thj union has been
called for Saturday night for this purpose
when it is thought the above will be ap
proved. Manager Axtell of the Caribou
will also concede the wage scale asked
for and It Is thought tVese two properties
will therefore continue operations uninter
ruptedly.
WATERLOO. 111.. Sept. 10.â William
Hoffman, a young farmhand, living near
Mayestown, 111., twelve miles southeast
of Waterloo, called his father-in-law,. Dr.
W. M. Brandt, to the door of his house
last night and shot him to death. Then
he rode back to his wife and told her
that "he had killed the old hound," her
father; gave her $2, vehich ha said he
wanted her to spend on the christening
of their four-weeks-old daughter Alary;
kissed her. and .their four children, and
rode into the wooda.
"There are two men I must kill before
I kill myself," he said to his wife be
fore leaving. -*tV,
Tho family of Dr. Brandt offers a re
ward of $300 for Hoffman's capture.
Sheriff Thomas Rupp and a large posse
are searching for him and expect at any
time to haye a pitched battle with him.
He is armed with a. shotgun and re
volvers. Before killing his father-in-law
he purchased fifty rounds of cartridges
for the srun.
Hoffman is an unerring marksman,
strong, athletic and the officers believe
was driven to recklessness by whisky and
his imaginary troubles. It is supposed
that Hoffman killed his father-in-law be- ,
cause the old gentleman refused to In
crease his weekly allowance. Dr. Brandt
was Quite wealthy and had been practi
cally supporting his son-in-law and
family.

GEM, Idaho, Sept. 10.â All miners em
ployed at the Frisco mine, one of the

is closed. The reason given by the men
is that they are afraid to work in the

in town and are taken by many for
earthquake shocks. Mining engineers say
the explosions are caused by cracking
rock and that there is no danger.

I.IERDIDIA. Tucatan. Sept. 10. â According
to official statements to the Yucatan Govern

this city during the month of August, of which
fifty proved fatal. '
The report from Washington to the ef;
feet that D. V. Richardson, General Su
perintendent of the postofflce at San Fran
cisco, has ' been indicted Is not positively
confirmed In advance of the Grand Jury's
report. There have been rumors for
weeks that he was Implicated. In fact It
was no secret that he had Invented a let
ter box device and his company had dealt
with the Government in their sale.
August W. Machen, one of the dismissed
ofnclals t now under indictment, sought to
connect' Congressman Loud of California
with the company's Interests, though It
was clearly shown to the satisfaction of
the postofflce officials that Loud's only in
terest was- an unselfish one and that Ire
had, as many.Congresmen are.Jn the hab
it of doing, sought to secure an early ad
justment of a claim of the letter box com
pany against the Postofflce Department.
A later dispatch from "Washington says:
"Dr. Eugene D. Scheble of Toledo, O.".
was one of, those Indicted with August W.
Machen in connection with contracts made
in 1301 for four years' supply of steel street
mall boxes. A man ln San Francisco
was another of those Indicted. The charge
against him was conspiracy, although de
tails cannot be ' learned here. United
States District . Attorney. Beach is . still

connection with postoffice scandals. Two

from various quarters that I have been a
heavy stockholder In the Postal Development
and Improvement Company. I have never seen
fit to deny them before, feeltng that the books
of the company would afford the best proof.
Hut now I will say that never, either directly
or indlrectlx. have I ever owned a cent's worth
of shares in that concern.
LOUD IS MYSTERIOUS.
When seen last night at his home at
1305 Octavia street ex-Congressman Eu
gene K". Loud spoke at some length upon
the subject of the recent investigation
Into the conduct of the business of the
San Francisco Postofflce. He said:
My position is a delicate one and does not
allow of my telling alt I know about affairs
both here and ln Washington. I was called
back to Washington some six months ago for
the especial purpose of giving my aid ln the
investigation of affairs ln San Francisco
which were then being carried on quietly.
Since my return I have been consulted by
some members of the Postal Development and
Improvement Company relative to the business
affaire of that concern, and so I am prac
tically occupying a dual role which does not
permit of my talking freely.
I can say. however, that I was present at
the Investigation held in Washington some
time ago which resulted in the secret investi
gation which was concluded here a month ago.
Whether or not the results of that investiga
tion or of the following one held here are of
such a nature as to oast Postmaster Montague
or his associates under . the cloud of suspicion,
I am not free to say. Personally, I have
heard of no indictment being promulgated by
the Federal Grand Jury against any person
connected with the local postofflce.
I knew that the Postofnce Department at
Washington Intended tending out Becret agents
to investigate the affairs of the San Fran
cisco office and I knoÂ«r pretty well the tenor
of their report. Postmaster Montague knew
that they were here anfl knew their busings,
but of course does not know" the nature of
their report. For almost a year the San Fran
cisco office has been under surveillance by the
authorities.
By Innuendo the assertions have been made
I have never been Â¦ president of the 1'ostal
Development and Improvement Company, nor
on it* board of directors. I have never at
tended a meeting of that board and do not
know tvhere its offices are. 1 have stock of
the concern in my name, but It does not be
longr to me. The invention ts a useful one and
dividends have been paid by the concern. I
do not know how many shares of stock I have.
If any one connected with the San Francisco
Postofflce has been indicted by the Federal
Grand Jury I do not know who it Is. The
inanufacture and sale of the attachment for
letter boxes showing the time for collection of
the next mall is a private enterprise, and if
any in the San Frinciseo Postofnce are inter
ested in the company it is in a commercial
eenÂ«e and entirely apart from their connection
with the rostofflce. I have no statement to
make ln regard to the reports concerning the.
affairs of the San Francisco rostofflce.
Mr. Montague is a very sick man. He
lay In his bed as he talked and was evi
dently suffering severe pain. The muscles
of his face contracted spasmodically as he
Epoke. His wife and niece. Miss Wright,
are in attendance. Mrs. Montague is

husband's Illness and declared to The Call

Francisco Postoffice.
ment and Improvement Company has
been working a system of "graft" by
charging the Postoffice Department an
extortionate price for the contrivances
which they were furnishing to it exclu
sively is not a new one. The device,
which is one for displaying the next hour
of mail collection, devised as an attach
ment for mall boxes, was patented by
Superintendent Richardson. A company,
including Richardson and Montague, con
tracted with the Government to furnish
these attachments exclusively at the rate
of J4 25 apiece. The claim has been made
that the company has been making profits
of over 75 per cent on the deal. This has
been denied by Montague.
Postmaster Montague, who is lying ill
at his summer nomc in Agnews, mude the
following denial of the charges reported
to have been made against him and of
the statement that his resignation was
imminent. He said:
I thought of resigning from the position I
hold two years ago on account of ill health,
but I have not done so and the etatement that
I Â¦would was not authorized by me.
I do not know why Mr. Richardson went

The situation appears in fact to have become some
what embarrassing to the farmers and they are now
asking an amendment to the game laws authorizing
farmers to kill deer that are destroying crops and in
juring orchards. The argument is that deer belong
to the woods; thaj it is right enough to protect them
OWING to the strict enforcement of the laws
for the protection of game in the various
States of New England those animals are
now becoming quite common not only in the wilds of
Maine and New Hampshire, but in States as far south
as Connecticut and Rhode Island. As there were no
wild deer in those two States when the laws went into
effect it is believed that those now seen so frequently
are the descendants of strays from private parks,
though there are some who hold that they have wan
dered down from the woods and mountains of North
ern New England.
The Hartford Times says that deer have become
so common in all parts of the State they attract little
or no attention and adds: "Naturally extremely
timid, the 'boldness/ if we may so term it, of the
Connecticut deer is remarkable. Illustrations of this
are of daily report; deer crossing a road close to
passing teams; coming into meadow lands near to
farm-houses; standing on the edge of woodlands
listening with evident curiosity to the whirr of the
mowing-machine, or even mingling with cows in the
pastures 'and paying little heed to the farmer's boy
when he conies to drive his animals home for the
milking. It would seem indeed that the deer are
coming to know that they have nothing to fear from
man, and if harm comes to them it will be from four
legged rather than biped creatures."
In Massachusetts it appears the increase of deer" has
Cone so far that in some localities they are looked
upon as a nuisance, and the Springfield Republican
notes '.hat a farmer in Berkshire County has made a
demand upon his township for reimbursement for
damage done to his crops by the animals. Comment
ing upon the case the Republican says: "The result
will be awaited with some interest, for it will appar
ently establish a precedent. If the town pays him for
his losses it will have to pay all other damages due
to similar causes. If it does not and the farmer has
to take his chances, then agriculture in that section
will have to face a new and somewhat serious handi
cap, because the deer are constantly appearing in
places where a few years ago they were only a mem
ory of prhniuve days. Even as far south as Connecti
cut complaints of ravages by these beautiful but irre
sponsible croatures are increasing. A farmer might
possibly escape with a slight penalty for shooting a
neighbor's cow for breaking into his preserves and
damaging his crops, but should he attempt to protect
himself in a similar way against the deer, to which
fences are mere playthings, no plea of extenuating
circumstances would be entertained."
DEER IN NEW ENGLAND.
A statement of the birth rate of the principal na
tions of Europe as compared with our own was
recently compiled by Mr. King, chief statistician for
vital statistics of the Census Office. The figures are
for the decade ending with the year 1900. They show
that the only countries having a smaller death rate
were Norway and Sweden, and those which had a
greater birth rate were Italy; and Austria-Hungary.
These same figures show that from June 1, 1890. until
May I, 1900, the average annual excess of births over
deaths in the United States was 17.7. per IOOO of popu
lation, while Prussia stood next in this respect, with
14.7 per 1000. Then came Holland, with 14 per 1000;
Norway, with 13.9: the German empire, with 13.7;
Denmark, with 12.6; Scotland, with 1 1.9, and England
and Wales, with 1 1.7 ;â¢ Â¦> < â¢
A CCORDING to the enumerators of the cen
/\ sus of 1900 there were born that year in the
*Â¦ *Â¦ United States 2,049,132 children, while the
total number of deaths was 1,039,094; so that the
census figures show 1,010,038 more births than deaths
for the census year. The figures are not regarded
as accurate by the census officials, because while reg
istrations of death are made with a very close ap
proximation of completeness, it is not so with births.
For the purpose of getting at a better estimate of
the birth rate of the country a system of calculation
has been adopted by the census experts, which is
thus stated: "The total population within the boun
daries of the United States in 1890 was 62,947,714, and
the natural increase in the decade following due to
excess of births over deaths was 12,315,361. The
average annual excess of births was 17.7 for every
1000 of the mean population. It is estimated that the
death rate of the country for the census year of 1900
was approximately 16.3 for every 1000 of the popula
tion. Assuming that it was about 18 for every 1000
in 1890, as estimated by the statistician of the eleventh
census, and taking the mean of these, or 17.4, as rep
resenting for this purpose the average annual death
rate for the decade, there must necessarily have been
an average annual birth rate of 35.1 for every 1000
of the mean population to produce the increase in
population actually enumerated."
If that calculation be correct our birth rate is
larger than that of any country in Europe with the
exceptions of Austria-Hungary and Italy The rate,
however, varies widely in one section of the Union
from that of another, and in a remarkable manner
when the birth rate of natives is compared with that
of immigrants. Thus the average rate of increase by
excess of births throughout the Union is estimated
to be in the case of native white parents. 19.5 per 1000
of population, while the increase was 36.5 for those
born of foreign .white parents. The extreme sectional
divergence is noted in the contrast between the
New England States and the Southern States; the
figures showing that in New England the annual
death-rate of children of native white parentage ex
ceeds the birth rate by 1.5 per 1000, while in the
South the excess of births of native white parents
was 24.1 per 1000.

A large gathering thronged St. Mary's
Cathedral last evening to hear Rev. John
W. Sullivan's address In aid of the Chil
dren's Day Homes. The subject of the
address was "The Attitude of the Church
on Marriage." The speaker Interested his
hearers from beginning to end. They
went to their homes edified and the de
serving charity received substantial bene
fit from the generous support given the
affair.
King Peter of Sejvia may consider the attempt to
assassinate him as one of the amenities of his new job.
Or he may accept conditions as he finds them and
go into the assassinating business on his own ac
count. This violent habit se'ems to be one of the
chief resources of the country.
That experience is no teacher is accepted as axiom
atic. The fact that a bucolic stranger to the city met
two men unknown to him, accompanied them and
was robbed by them in Golden Gate Park* a few days
ago will probably do somebody else some good.
MENACE TO NAVIGATION.
The ever-recurring fogs on the Califor
nia coast are a dread menace to naviga
tion, and much loss of life and property
has been due to the lack of facilities to
give, timely warning to navigators.
One of the most important matters that
It is claimed that when an examination
of baggage is made 2000 miles away from
the port where the articles are ultimately
to be landed, proper vigilance can not be
exercised and that it would be an easy
matter for smuggled goods to be landed
In San Francisco. It is further asserted
that the examination of baggage made at
Honolulu also works great hardship on
passengers when a customs officer in the
Islands insists on the payment of duty
when It should not be assessed. The offi
cials in San Francisco are more in touch
with the Board of Customs Appraisers of
New York, and owing to the volume of
business in. this port are more able to ad
just disputes readily.
Assistant Secretary Armstrong is also
empowered to Investigate the needs of the
Pacific Coast for a better protection to
Incoming and outgoing vessels;. It Is an
admitted .fact that the Pacific Coast has
far. less protection than the Atlantic
Coast in the matter of lightships, light
houses and warnings to mariners.
The customs officials of San Francisco
feel that they have not been treated with
proper consideration in the issuance of
the order which gives Collector Stackable
of Honolulu the authority to examine and
pass upon articles and personal effects
destined to be landed in San Francisco
from the Orient. While no reflections are
cast upon the customs officials stationed
in the Hawaiian Islands, the officials in
San Francisco feel that the door has
been opened to gross frauds upon the
Government.
Not only have passengers been annoyed
by the examination of baggage at Hono
lulu, but in many instances their lives
have been imperiled.
Collector Stackable, after boarding
steamships at Honolulu destined for
San Francisco, has examined the bag
gage and effects of passengers and then
placed the customs seals on all trunks
and packages. The property of the pas
sengers was removed from their custody
and not given back to them until after
their arrival at the dock in this city.
Unable to secure their belongings, men
and women and delicate children have
been compelled to travel in thin clothing
from the tropics to the lower temperature
of, the Pacific Coast, and many instances
are on record where serious complications
have ensued. / .
In addition to the inconvenience to in
coming passengers, the local customs of
ficials have been beset with many difficul
ties. Instances are known where baggage
containing dutiable articles was passed
by the inspectors at Honoluluj and when
a demand was made at San Francisco for
tho amount of duty the owners of the
goods would present certificates of exam
ination and permits to land the articles,
free of duty, issued at Honolulu. Collec
tor Stratton of the port of San Francisco
has sent a number of communications to
Secretary of the Treasury Shaw, drawing
the attention of the Washington official
to the existing condition of affairs, j
DOOR OPENED TO FRAUD.
PASSENGERS IN PERIL.
The main cause for the presence of As
sistant Secretary Armstrong and Collec
tor Stranahan of New York in San Fran
cisco is that some months ago Collector
Ernest R. Stackable of Honolulu obtained
an order from Secretary of the Treasury
Shaw that all baggage and effects of pas
sengers from the Orient destined to ar
rive in San Francisco should be examined
at Honolulu and not In this city. Collec
tor Stackable of Honolulu has not made
public his reasons for securing the order.
About ten days ago the order was tem
porarily suspended, but Collector Stark
able has filed a request that it again be
enforced and will personally urge his
plea before Assistant Secretary Arm
strong.
sengers arriving from the Orient are ex
amined by customs officials.
In addition to the investigation regard
ing the examination of baggage, the offi
cials will also go thoroughly Into the
question of the needs of California for an
improved system of lightships, beacons,
buoys and fog signals, a matter that has
been agitated before Congress for many
years.
There is not a single navigator entering
the bay of San Francisco who does not
feel that the protection to navigation is
The result was that the O'.ga piled upon
the beach and was only saved from total
destruction by the efforts of six powerful
tugs. Suits to the amount of $50,000 for
salvage were brought by the tug owners
against the owners of the steamship, but
this amount was cut down on the final
award.
CAUSES BIO'S WBECK.
Assistant Secretary Armstrong will Inves
tigate is the need for a second lightship
off the port of San Francisco." There is
but one lightship here, which is known as
"Lightship No. 70," which is moored
about three and a quarter miles outside,
of the bar, off the entrance to San Fran
cisco harbor and eleven miles from Fort
Point lighthouse and nine miles southeast
from Bonlta Point lighthouse.
During the month of April the lightship
is withdrawn from service for repairs and
during its absence its place is marked by
a gas buoy showing a fixed white light.
The slightest accident to the gas buoy,
which has Â¦ ve.ry often dragged from its
moorings, leaves the entrance to the
Golden Gate absolutely unprotected.
The absence of the lightship from her
station on November 8, 1900, was the sole
cause of the Anstrain steamship Olga
going ashore two miles below the Cliff
House. The captain of the vessel was
seeking to steer by the lanterns on the
masts of the lightship and mistook the
lights of the Cliff House for those he ex
pected to find, owing to the lightship be
ing off her station for repairs.
Surveyor of the Port Spear and Deputy
Surveyor Chauncey St. John, who have
immediate charge of the customs official*
here and of the examination of baggage of
passengers, will also bo present at the
meetings with the Kastern officials. The
first gathering of the Federal officers will
take place this afternoon.
Colonel John P. Irish. Naval Officer of
the port of San Francisco, who has al
ways been interested in securing adequate
lightship and lighthouse facilities for the
Pacific Coast, will also be one of the offi
cials to take part in the investigation.
OFFICIALS WILL CONFER.
The' inveslffatio- will take place tn the
rooms of Collector of the Port Stratton In
the Custom-house. Collector Stratton will
not be able to be present at the meetings,
owing to illness, but he will be represent

matter of examination of baggage of pas
sengers at Honolulu.
A correspondent of the London Mail in reviewing
German progress says: "The marvelous expansion
of German trade â one of the notable achievements of
the nineteenth century â is often referred to as at
tributable wholly to the fostering effects of bounties,
but in real truth many factors have combined to pro
duce the remarkable result. * * * There can be
but little doubt that the growth of many immense
industries is traceable to the system of education that
has directed all the available powers of scientific
knowledge and research upon industrial problems."
The writer goes on to add: "In Germany the uni
versity has in a measure been displaced from its po
sition as crown of the educational edifice; or rather
the classical foundations now share their supremacy
with institutions of a more modern growth. The
universities still maintain their old high rank as
training schools in the humanities, but it is in the
technical high schools that keen business men with
sound scientific knowledge are to-day receiving their
training. * * * The technical high schools are
< sser.tially modern institutions. They date back no
â¢urtber than the nineteenth century, and their effec
tiveness is matter of the last generation. Established
as trade schools for the study of special subjects, they
have widened their operation until they stand to-day
for the application of scientific knowledge in all di
rections to the special requirements of commercial
industry."
Such being the progress of Germany in industrial
training, it is not strange that Sir Norman Lockyer
has dccmed*it advisablet to address the British As
sociation on "Brain Power in History" and pointed
the moral that Britain must increase her industrial
brain power or fall out of the race with her highly
trained rivals.
tâ -jRNESTVL. HARRIS, commercial agent at
r- < Eibenstock,. contributes to the current number
Aâ' of Consular Reports a review oi the grd^vth and
present extent of industrial education and training
in Germany, which goes far to explain the success
the Germans have obtained in recent years in all
lines of industry and commerce. The Government
of the empire and that of the different states are
doing much to promote the technical excellence of
the German workman and to make him as fit for the
industrial struggle as the German soldier is for war.
Taking Saxony as a typical state of the empire,
Mr. Harris says it has 287 industrial schools, and as
the total population is but 4,202,216, there is there
fore one industrial school for every 14,641 people.
The schools are of various grades and kinds. There
are 12 known as "advanced industrial schools," 150
"special industrial schools," 32 industrial schools for
drawing and painting, 21 industrial schools for
women, girls and children, 44 "industrial, primary or
continuation schools," and 18 other industrial
schools connected with as many public schools of
the kingdom. The story of the progress of that kind
of training in Saxony is told by the simple statement
that while there are now all these varied schools in
operation, there were as late as 1882 only twenty-two
of them in the whole country.
Other German states are abreast of Saxony in the
march of industrial training. Thus in speaking of
.some of them the report of Mr. Harris says: "The
Government of Wurttemberg has done much to in
troduce and support new industries. It is the duty
of the Royal Bureau for Commerce to keep in close
touch with all industrial schools in Wurttemberg."
* * * "Industrial education in Baden is far ad
vanced. There is a school in almost every city and
village between Heidelberg and the Lake of Con
stance. Fully 20.000 apprentice? are learning how to
make clocks, cotton, woolen and silk goods." * ? ?
"Hessen can boast of the fact that there is not a
single village, no matter how small, that has not an
industrial school of some kind." * * * "Bavaria
is also well supplied with industrial schools." * * *
"The Prussian state railways have also established
industrial schools."'
Thus the report goes on outlining the extent to
which the Governments of the various parts of the
empire provide for the instruction of the people in
useful arts and industries. The progress thus made
has attracted the attention of the British, who see in
the schools an explanation of Germany's sudden rise
as a competitor of British workmen, not only in the
general markets of the world, but in the markets of
Great Britain herself.

DURING the time of the yacht races at Sandy
Hook the efforts of a wireless telegraph
company to report the races were baffled by
a competing company, which, according to New
York reports, interjected into the dispatches a lot of
odd bits of poetry interspersed with ribald jests.
The demonstration appears to have made it certain
that as wireless telegraphy is now used it cannot be
safeguarded against wanton or malicious interruption
cf that kind, and very naturally the affair has given
rise to a Â«ood deal of discussion.
As the law protects every man in the enjoyment of
his property, it is clear that if an interruption of a
wireless telegraph service could be proven to have
been committed intentionally the court would doubt
less give damages to the injured party. There would
be, however, a great deal of difficulty in proving an
intenrional interruption and tracing it to any par
ticular individual. Hence the necessity for so improv
ing the system that the waves transmitting the mes
sage may be made practically safe from disturbance
by any other set of waves.
The case is put very clearly by the New York
Press in this way: '"Proof is yet wanting that the
threat of the German company to destroy the useful
ness of Marconi's transatlantic service by erecting a
wireless pole on the shores of the North Sea was a
vain one. When a man sends a message, 'Will be
home at 8 o'clock,' he does not want to have a rival
wireless company interject into it a few lines from
'We won't go home till morning,' or to have a 'wire
less' engaging rooms at the Savoy, London, caught
on the fly by a malicious German and changed into
a tirade of abuse against the proprietor of the hotel.
The horrid possibilities of wireless interference are
so appalling that before the system can come into
popular use the inventors must convince the public
that they have securely provided against it s "
At the recent international wireless telegraph con
ference at Berlin efforts were made to adopt regula
tions covering that and other points of interest in
the new enterprise, but it docs not appear that the
agreements will be of much use in that particular.
The utmost that could be done was the adoption of
an article providing that wireless telegraph stations
must be so organized as not to interfere with the
service of other stations. The agreements, however,
will be of no effect unless the various governments
of the earth enact laws to enforce it. Even in that
case there would be trouble, for were a telegraph
service operating in one country to be interfered with
by a company operating in another country the ques
tion as to which of the countries should have juris
diction in the case might be embarrassing. In short,
the best thing the rival companies can do is to set
their experimenters to work devising a system that
cannot be interrupted, and whose messages will not
require the guardianship of statutes and courts.
WIRELESS TELEGRAPH TROUBLES
Official reports from China announce that the Em
press Dowag'cr, the virtual and autocratic ruler of
the empire, cannot live more than a year. If prece
dent in her case counts, though, what a merry mess
of things Mongolian she can make before she dies.
6. For $1,647,000 for new public library facilities.
This is unnecessary and should not be voted. The
excuse for building the new Hall of Justice, oppo
site Portsmouth square, was to vacate room ia- the
City Hall for the public library. This promise, car
ried out, renders unnecessary the going into debt
for more library facilities.
7. For $741,000 for a public park to be used as a
children's playground. The proposition is indefinite.
No location is named. All parks are playgrounds
for children, and within them may be specific reser
vations for that purpose. This proposition may be
voted down without any injury to the city.
8. For $330,000 for a northerly extension of Golden
Gate Park, to connect with the Presidio reservation.
This is an exceedingly beneficial extension of our
great park and should be adopted.
9. 10, ir, 12. are for bonds, aggregating $1,254,000,
for parks on Telegraph Hill, Twin Peaks, St. Mary's
square and the Mission. The acquisition of land for
parks in a great and growing city is always praise
worthy and to be commended. The sites proposed are
so distributed as to put these places of health and re
creation within convenient resort of a majority of our
people, and when finished they will beautify the city
and conserve health and morals.
The last and separate proposition is for a bonded
debt, a lien on the whole city and county, to furnish
capital at the expense of all the taxpayers, to build a
railroad for the use of those only who patronize the
Geary-street road. It is vicious in principle and
should be voted down. If the city want to go into
the street railroad business for the benefit of a small
minority of the taxpayers the plant should bear all the
burden of the bonds. The praiseworthy purpose of
the several bond issues will cost the taxpayers about
$40,000,000 by the time the bonds are paid, and they
should not be burdened with unnecessary and experi
mental and unbusinesslike expenditures.
5. For $697,000 for a new County Jail. The old
building en Broadway is a disgrace to the city. There
are country counties in the State that have better
quarters for the safe-keeping of prisoners. . The old
jail cannot be adapted to the demands upon it, and
the safety of the community, as well as common hu
manity, demand a new jail.
4. For $1,621,000 for repair and improvement oi
accepted streets. Is a necessary purpose. The streets
are originally paved at the expense of abutting prop
erty, and when accepted should be kept in a state
of efficiency by the city.
2. For $7,250,000 for a new sewer 6ystem for the
city. The rapid. growth of the city has compelled
connections with the main sewers their con
fluents requiring a capacity not provided for in their
original construction. . The result is the overtaxing of
the drainage, and the overflow of storm water re
sults, often inflicting great damage to property.
The incapacity of the drainage is a menace to public
health, and this bond issue to make the sewer sys
tem equal to present and future demands, upon it
should be adopted.
3. For $3,595,000 for improvement of existing and
construction of new schoolhouses. Should be sup
ported, the only criticism of it being its probable in
sufficiency for the highly necessary purpose to which
it is devoted.
THE people of San Francisco are called upon to
vote to bond the city for the following pur
poses and in the following amounts, the prop
ositions being numbered consecutively on the official
ballot:
i. For $1,000,000 for a new City and County Hos
pital. This is a very necessary and praiseworthy pur
pose and the issue should be supported.
so long as they stay in the woods, but when they,
come down into the farm lands they should be dealt
with as a nuisance. It is impossible that a given
area of country should be at once a farming district
and a deer park, and as one of the two must go the
farmers purpose to drive the deer back to the wilds
or else get the township and county governments to
pay for the damage they do.

bers of the family besides have given utterance to words that have <
added vastly to the mystery of the misery and growing unhappiness that -
is said to be settling heavily upon His Holiness. Strangest of all, they i
speak authoritatively, without malice, but in deepest compassion*, and '<
their words are being given credence far and wide, more particularly as *
Pius X has been adding equally strange confirmation. ;1i
He speaks continuously of the many things in his life that he had '<â¢
treasured that are now gone from him forever, and in this way the *
boyhood, the early manhood, the later ambition, the inner life of His \
Holiness is brought forth more dramatically than it could be in any I
other way. That is how Mr. I. Cochrane has been able to write the I
remarkable article for the next Sunday Call, which, with the pictures ?
from Rome, occupies a full page. It is the most valuable article about K
the new Pope that has yet been secured anywhere. " Z
Indeed, it is just such features as the above that ha3 given journal- Â£
istic excellence to the Sunday Call's Magazine Section, which is already Â£
far in the lead in a literary way. It is no idle bdast. or boast at all Â£
to say that no other paper in America can offer so much of eenuine c
merit and fascinating interest. ?

The purpose of McCormlck's trip was to
acquaint himself with the wonders of the
canyon and to determine Just what may
be done toward making it a popular place
for tourists to visit. Leaving the South
ern Pacific Company's line at Sanger the
party was conveyed to Millwood by stage
and from there to the center of the can
yan they traveled on horseback, camping
along the route and minutely noting
everything worthy of being seen. Even
tually proceeding on their journey the
party climbed over the Sierras and finally
reached Independence, where they board
ed the Carson and Colorado train and vis
ited Carson. Virginia City and Lake Ta
hoe. Discussing his trip yesterday Mr.
McCormick said:
~' I am satisfied that Kings River Canyon,
with the" grandeur of its natural scenery,
which in many respects surpasses that of ro
aemlte Valley' will become the great play
ground of the world, and hot many years hence
either From the result* of my own experi
ences ' in* the canyon and with what I havo
learned from , Prof eÂ»sor Le Conte. who is as
familiar with every nook and small stream in
the wonderful place as one would be with the
interior sections of his own house. I am cer
tain that a targe proportion of the westbound
travelers every year can be pursuaded to make
the trio I Game and flsh abound in the can
yon and the climate is invltlnK until
the latter part -of this month, when the
snows are encountered. We have figured that
we will be able to carry a passenger from San
Francisco to the canyon by way of Sanger
and the other points we passed and out on the
other Bide over the Sierras, thence to Lake Ta
hoe and from there back to this | city, in
twelve dayB, furnishing: him all necessary ac
commodations during the trip, for a sum not
over S72 I purpose to make the experiment
next season and feel confident that It will
prove successful.
While In Virginia City McCormick and
his companions enjoyed a ride down the
shaft of the California and Consolidated

Albert Gallatin commenced suit In the
Superior Court yesterday against James
Treadwell and John Treadwell to recover
the sum of $14,120 and costa. The plain
tiff claims that on September 10, 1901, he
was the owner of 300 shares of the Sac
ramento Electric Gas and Railway Com
pany, worth $41 80 per share. The certi
ficates of the stock stood in the name of
Joshua Barker and were indorsed bv him
in blank. oy mm
Plaintiff claims he was entitled to that
stock. He further alleges that on the
date in question the defendants, beinir
jointly In possession of said certificates
unlawfully converted them to their own
use and disposed of them to plaintiffs
damage to the extent of $12,540.
The plaintiff claims he has been dam
aged to the extent of a further sum of
$1080, and has also been put to the ex
pense of ' $500 in trying to reclaim his
stock or the value thereof.
At the end of the hotly contested legal
Joust Judge Sloss announced that he
would probably have his ruling on the
amendment ready by Saturday mqrnin>r
and that the taking of testimony will be
commenced at the morning eession on
Monday.

Then Attorney Albert Johnson closed
the argument over the amendment by
fringing to bear tho cumulative weight of
court decisions from California to Wiscon
sin. Attorney Dunne did not specify in
his amendment what time elapsed be
tween the moment when Beale's angry
passions were first aroused and when he
and Williams went to demand a retrac
tion from the editor, and Johnson vehe
mently declared that sufficient "cooling
time" had elapsed between the two criti
cal moments for the ruffled tempers of
Beale and Williams to regain their nor
mal temperatures, and that consequently
the assault was premeditated and beyond
the pale of palliation by mitigating cir
cumstances. He furthermore character
ized the mooted amendment as uncertain
Indefinite and ambiguous. * '
when the case was resumed yesterday
morning. By citing the decisions of the
Supreme Court of N>w York and other
authorities he attempted to demonstrate
tuat ( .n the case of an assault like that
made by Beale and Williams upon Mar
riott, where great provocation undoubt
edly existed, the plaintiff had trans
gressed the law in that he had given juat
cause for the assault by his scandalous
article and- that he should be punished
with the perpetrators of the deed by be
ing denied anything save compensatory
damages. Evident mitigation of their of
fense, claimed Dunne, could be recognized
by legal precedent.
recover $100,000 damages for an
assault committed by them on September
3. 1902, partook yesterday of the nature of
a legal duel between the attorneys repre
senting the prosecution and the defense.
The whole day's proceedings were occu
pied by lengthy arguments by Attorney
Peter F. Dunne, representing Beale and
Williams, and a comprehensive rebuttal
on the part of Attorney Albert Johnson
on behalf of Kdltor Marriott, his client.
When the trial opened on Tuesday
Dunne sought to introduce as an amend
ment to the answer of the defense clauses
calculated to demonstrate that in their
attack upon Marriott, Beale and Williams
had ample provocation in the form of the
alleged scandalous article in the News
Letter against the former's fiancee, and
thereby allowing of a plea of mitigating
circumstances on behalf of his clients. To
this, Hiram and Albert Johnson, the at
torneys for the plaintiff, submitted a de
murrer, Albert Johnson occupying the
whole of Tuesday afternoon in submitting
to Judge Sloss legal precedents to show
why the amendment should not be ac
cepted.
Attorney Dunne took up the battle
THE second day's proceedings in
the civil suit Instituted by Fred
Marriott against Truxtun Beale
and Thomas H. Williams, to
We aUo wish to ask that our masters and
others having dealings with the bridge shall
not be abused by the tenders, and that the
bridge crew shall do business on the bridge and
not in the sa!'X>ns. Yours truly.
A. P. LORENTZEN.
The above represents the case of masters,
owners and parties using the channel. We ln-
FifÂ«t upon our right to use It, and no matter
who are the owners of that hridge it will have
to open when we want to pars. The channel
is navigable anÂ«i was there before the bridge.
If the present owners will not operate it
properly, by sober men, we shall most certain
ly apit-al to those who control the navigable
waters cf this State.
The schooner Queen was west of the bridge
and empty, to come out at 9 a. m. ; the tug J.
: H. Redmond was east of the bridge, to come
I through to take Queen In tow. At about 10
a. m. Captain Hfnrlcksen of the Queen report
ed to me that the bridge tender had refused to
open the bridge and had gone away. We were
then at Herry-Btreet wharf and walked directly
to the bridge, where we met Captain Johnson
| cf the tug J. H, Redmond, who reported that
j he had been abused by the bridge -tender when
j he asked to have the bridge opened.
I Together we mounted the stairs on the
Â¦ bridge, entered the engine-room and found the
' piece entirely deserted. Securing a sheet of
i paper, we made the following note:
Sept. 9, lo:15 a. m.-Xo one in charge of
j Fourth-street bridge. Steam gauge shows for
, ty-flve pounds: water In glass a small third.
I Vessel* want to i.ass. Tender has now been
I away forty minutes."
â¢ This was signed by A. C. Johnson, master
â¢ tug J. H. Kedmond; II. Henrlcksen, master
schooner Queen; A. P. Lorentzen. manager
: schooner Queen; John Nelson, master steamer
j North F*crk.
A man then appeared who said if we ever
: came up on the bridge again he would throw
us down. He said he was a "down below
! man," meaning that he attended to the south
j end of the bridge, and that the bridge would
! not be opened, at least not before 1 p. m., and
} further, that we might all betake ourselves to
a place generally supposed to be hot.
Meanwhile, this man. with others, paid sev
"j.il visits to saloons In the neighborhood, and
the number of vessels wanting to oome
through Increased, the steamers blowing their
Â¦ whiftles continually.
About 11 a. m. the bridge opened and the
â¢ Queen at last passed through, after waiting
! fu!l two hours, with plenty of water in the
; channel all the while.
The Indifference and unbusinesslike
xrethods that prevail at the Fourth-street
drawbridge have long been a source of
complaint on the part of ship owners and
mariners and the conditions seem to be
growing worse instead of improving.
The bridge tenders, it is said. ara not
only negligent, but insolent, and shipping
men are talking of appealing to the pro
per authorities to remedy the existing
nuisance. The following letter explains
itself:
SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 9. 1903.

Girl3 vrho work are particularly susceptible to female ills, especially when obliged to stand on their
feet from morning until night.
Day in and day out, month in and month out, the year through, the "working girl toils; she is often tha
bread -winner of the family, and must work that ethers may live ; whether she is sick or well, whether it
rains or shines, whether it is warm or cold she must get to her place of employment and perform tha
duties exacted from her.
5 Among this class the symptoms of female diseases are early manifest by weak and aching backs,
pain in the lower limbs and lower part of the stomach; in consequence of frequent wetting of the feet
monthly periods become painful and irregular, and frequently faint and dizzy spells, with loss of appetite,
until life is a burden and it is hard work to drag about." All these symptoms point to a derangement of tho
female organism, and if taken in time can be easily and permanently cured. ._ j

me that I wish to recommend it to all girls whose work keeps them standing on their feet all day in a

seem to realize that a girl cannot afford to stop working. My back ached, my appetite was poor and I
could not sleep ; menstruation was scanty end very painful. One day when suffering I commenced to
take Lydia E. Pinkhanrs Vegetable Compound and it helped me, I soon found that my menstrual
periods were free from pain and natural ; now my health is fine, and every one is surprised at the Fchango

that whipping finishes characterized
every toeat, the leaders being neck ana
neck as they passed under the wire. In
each heat the first horse received $1500
and the second JJOO. The remaining nooo
waa then divided according to the sum
mary at the conclusion of the third heat,
$Â£000 going to the flr3t horse. WOO to tha
second, $300 to the third and $300 to tha
fourth. The final division was: Billy
Buck $530Q. Walnut Hall $1900, Hawthorne
$1100 and Swtft $500.
In the first heat WaJnut Hall had thÂ»
pole and held the lead all the way
around. As the horses passed under tha
wire the finish was so close that none
could tell the winner although soma
thought that It was either Walnut Hall's
race or a tie. The decision of the Judged,
however, was In favor of Billy Buck.
In the next heat the same two horses
fought It out, Billy Buck winning by
half a length in an exciting finish.
When the horses in third and last heat

SACRAMENTO, 'Sept. 10.â The Senators'
winps were not in working? order to-day and a
number of throwing errors followed that gave
the game to the Portland team. Fitzgerald
was pitching an excellent article of ball, but
the errors on the cart of his support would
have lost any pitcher the game. The day was
close and. sultry, without a breath of air In
motion, and in consequence it was hard for
the players of both teams. Score:

HARLEM ENTRIES.
The game at Recreation- Park yester
day was about the limit for bad baseball
and still worse judgment on the part of
the umpire. The Cripples finally man
aged to get two runs to the good, not
through any supreme effort on their part,
but just because the northern band was
something awful. \ Score: Oakland, 7;
Seattle, 5.
It started off badly and never got bet
ter. Every inning brought some new ca
lamity to the front till the fans fairly
screamed for something better. All the
players seemed to be suffering from some
kind of dopey complaint, and try as they
would tney could not play the game.
Jimmy St. Vraln, who has been a star
and a tramp and who has had experience
in every league in the country, includ
ing the bush organizations, appeared in
the box at Recrlation Park for the first
time'. If he can do no better he should not
essay to go on the slab here again. He
was wild and the Cripples hit him as
oftenlas they wanted to.
Then his support always got bad at the
wrong time and this also helped the Crip
ples. Devereaux of Oakland was in
fairly good form, but In the sixth inning
he called It off and Cooper was -brought
to the front. He got the. worst of It from
the umpire and allowed the Seattles a
pair of runs. He waa lucky, to get off
so easily.
The Cripples started In the opening
round and clouted the offerings of St.
Vraln to the several^ corners of the lot.
They kept up the waljoplng till every
man on the team had taken a ride on the
ball.
Then the visitors took a hand at the
batting game and the score was finally^
tied up in the sixth Inning. The Crip
ples started again in the sixth, landing
two runs on a pair of hits and errors by
Jansing and Byers. This settled it, all
and brought victory to Peter and his
tribe. The score:

. All the smart ones unloaded on Hercules
to win" the five furlong dash following
and played him from 3 to" 1 to even
money. The old bush horse led from
start to finish. At the wire, the nitely
rated Maresa was half a length behind
him and Metlakatla a good third.
Mountebank, ridden by Frawley, closed
a mild favorite over Ultruda for the sev
enth race, a six furlong affair, but again
disappointed his admirers. Lewis, on Ul
truda, tofck the lead berore the stretch
was reached and won with considerable to
spare. In a drive the favorite downed
Cambaceres for the place.
MISS VERA WINS HANDILY.
For the mile and 100 yard run the 3 to 2
favorite, Miss Vera, turned up the easiest
sort of a winner. See had the leg up and
drawing away from, the bunch the last
eighth, downed Dark Secret and Dwight
way three open lengths. Malplaque^ led to
the stretch and then blew up. Harry Stov
er's Illowaho, shouldering Willie See and
116 pounds, went to the post an even
money chance for the concluding mile
handicap. The burden was too great and
Illowaho ran unplaced. At odds of 3 to 1
Howson t on Solon, got up in time to get a
neck verdict from Chileno, in 1:40 flat.
F. E. MULH0LLAND.
There was come dissatisfaction over the
mile handicap. Divlna, carrying 114
pounds and ridden by Lee Jackson, had
first call in the betting, and, after heading
Hagerdon with half the route traversed,
won well in hand. Two lengths behind
came Horatius with 107 pounds In the sad
dle and trailing in his wake the feather
weighted Step Around. At the first turn
Burk on Hagerdon cut across from the
outside, almost causing an accident and
nearly turning- Horatius around.i But for
this, the finish might have been an inter
esting one. Burk was^flned $25 for rough
riding.
Nellie May, a 3 to 1 chance with
Howson on her back, took the first run
ning event, a five furlong- dash. The mare
passed Miss Dividend in the run home and
In a hard drive lasted just long enough
to beat the favorite, Blondura, a head.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 10.â Thl3 was
Governor's day at Agricultural Park, and
although the weather was oppressively
warm, the temperature making the grand
stand about as comfortable as the hot
room In a Hammam bath, the attendance
was 'the largest of the meeting. Gov
ernor Pardee and staff were present, his
Excellency viewing several of the events
from the Judges' stand as the guest of the
track officials.
The programme was an excellent one,
comprising one harness and eight running
events. Of this number live choices were
returned first. Dlvina decamped with the
mile handily, tripping off the distance In
1:39 flat. Instructor won the Stallion
Etakes', the exact value of which had not
been figured out by the society. The Gov
ernor's stake over one and an eighth
miles resulted in a walkover for Grafter.
The lone harness number, the 2:17. trot,
resulted In another victory for Ole. The
bay gelding won a 10 to 5 favorite over his
field and scored In straight heats after
an uninteresting race.
Just an even half dozen 2-j;ear-olds
started for the rich Stallion stakes at six
furlongs, with $1000 added by the society.
Klmwood Farm's entry, Instructor, shoul
dering 118 pounds and which had been
brought on by Owner Charles Boots ex
pressly to start in this race, was always
a Btrong favorite In the betting. .^
H. L. Frank was reported to have been
ailing the nieht before and from 6 to 5
his odds soared to twos. The good looking
Dr. Rowell was third in demand with
bettors. Aftfr a considerable delay Dick
Havey released the barrier with Zenonlan
showing flrsfc^ The outsider led Eva*D
into the streteh, with See, on the favor
ite, only galloping in third place. When
ready See gave Instructor his head and
he romped in first, four lengths in ad
vance of Dr. Rowell and Eva D, in 1:15.
H. L. Frank cut but a small figure. in the
actual running.

CHICAGO, Sept. 10â Don Domo, the
"gray streak," matie it four straight vic
tories to his credit when he annexed the
Sapling stakes at Harlem to-day, thereby
adding $2035 more to the bank account of
his owner. J. li. Respesa" Copperfleld.
for which he paid $8000, finished second
and Touchstone third. Among some the
opinion prevailed that Don Domo could
not run in the mud. This idea was cer
tainly abandoned aTter his showing to
day. The gelding broke a bad last, but
being on the outside, he ran past his
tield as though all were tied. When lined
for home he had a lead of five lengths
and .Terrell then took his time, the gray
2-year-old winning utiextended by two
and a half lengths.
The track was sloppy, growing heavier
as it was out up by the horses. Favorites
won In every race and the talent had
the bookies on the run. The weather was
clear and cool and a large crowd was at
tracted to the course by the good card.

onstrated In the Flight stakes at Sheeps
head Bay to-tlay, when sho won by only
.-i length- under Red fern's most vigorous
riding. Young Henry's rush through the
stretch was inspiring to those who admire
pameners in a racer and It was a lucky
thing for Leonora Loring that the tlnish
was so rlose at hand. The stake waa
worth $3725 to the winner. The time niade
by Leonora Loring. 1:221-6. over the
straight seven forlongs of the Futurity
course, is not a record, but it is very close
to it. Mr. Whitney won the Flight -takes

The latest researches of science indicate
that we are on the threshold of marvel
ous discoveries in the realm of nature's
finer forces. That there is an invisible
world about us, from which come all our
coarEer.substances, is an hypothesis that
has been pretty well established. Dr.
Mclvor-Tyndall, in his psychic demon
strations at Stelnway Hall, works out
this scientific theory In a practical, in
structive and entertaining way. There
is nothing of the magical about Dr. Mc-
Ivor-Tyndall's experiments. They but
prove the hypothesis lately accepted by
science, of the power of thought as an
electrical force. At Stelnway Hall, Sun
day evening. Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall will
demonstrate this marvelous invisible
force by experiments in psychic phenom
ena. The subject of the lecture, preced
ing the experiments, will be "Divorce: Its
Relation to Psychology." Reserved seat

Pitts." 100S Market street. A crowded

t t-ived from the estate of her father by
Mrs. Ella Bacon Soule was the subject of
judicial inquiry to-day in the case now
j ending lx-fore Judge Melvln, in which
Professor Frank Soule is petitioning the
court to relieve him of the burden of pay
ing his former wife J75 a month alimony.
Attorneys for Soule introduced the orig
inal appraisement of the estate, which
was valued over ten years ago at $8SS,
023 7S. Mrs. Soule was on the stand the
entire day. She acknowledged that she
had inherited a third of this amount-
Since then it is claimed the property

composed will now be gone into in order
to get at the true value of Mrs. Soule's

FINDING OUT VALUE
OF THE BACON ESTATE
CHICO, Sept. 10.â The Admission day
celebration given in honor of the Veteran
Firemen of San Francisco ended to-day
with competitive races among the com
panies of the local Fire Department for
the cup offered by â¢ the veterans. The
same course was run as was used in the
contest of yesterday. The members of
the Veteran Firemen's Association of San
Francisco were much in evidence and
seemed to take the greatest interest in
the results. Engine Company No. 2 won
the first go and without balk or hitch
the team went down the line at a gait
which not only won the local champion
ship but Improved on the record made
yesterday by the department team when
it won the championship of the upper val
ley. They got water in 25*4 seconds. Like
yesterday's contest, the victory was won
by the first team running.
Western made a gallant run, but a small
leak in their hose decreased the speed
of the water and they got water in 30 1-5
seconds. No. 1 made no decided blunders,
but failed to get water under 33 seconds.
Deluge, which has the largest number of
runners in the department team, lost on
fin accident which might have resulted
seriously to one of its members. Harry
Downing in attempting to loosen the cap
from the hyrant, was struck by the hub
of the heavy whel and hurled, stunned
and bruised, ten feet away. This left the
reelman alone and he was unable to make
the connection unaided and threw the
hose down. Downing is thought to be
hurt internally.
Celebration at Cbico Is Concluded
With, a Series of Lively
Contests.

IN COMPETITIVE RACES
PERSONAL MENTION.
In your talk on Thursday will you kindly
suggest to nature's perpetual freshmen of all
classes that this season of the year Is a Rood
one in which to let the football men alone.
The. football men are weary of telling now
they feel and how much they weigh: they are
tired of anawerinsr questions in regard to thÂ«
makeup of the team, and tired to death of
fool advice. They are glad to give their leis
ure to football, but outside of practice th#y
would Ilka to have some time to devote to
themselves and to their work. Next to the
man who offers to "treat" an athlete during
the training season the worst enemy of Stan
ford athletics Is the man who uses up tha
athlete's time and nerves in useless talk.
Â¦\Ve have In America a kind of college man
who is able to understand life as life. To
this type the Stanford man belongs. It was
the dream of the founders that this univer
sity should 'exist for such men â men of ad
vanced enlightenment and accurate training,
men for leadership in action and leadership
in thought. This ideal is beginning to unfold
Itself. The Stanford man has something that
other men may not have â effectiveness, broad
mindedness, seir-restralnt and the beginning*
of these. Stanford spirit.
President Jordan read and strongly in
dorsed the following letter from a rr.nn
prominently connected with atheletics at
Stanford:
A college would not be worth mucb if It
did not have its student activities, such as
athletics, dramatic* and literary enterprises,
and these must be supported by the students.
About nine girls to one man pass by tho
treasurer without paying their dollar. Women
have too long been admitted free to the Ice
cream parlors to think it necessary to pay
for the support of these legitimate college ac
tivities. Their action in this respect may be
responsible to a larpe degree for the adver*s
criticism of coeducation.
Dr. Jordan then referred to the habit
of some students in falling to support
student body enterprises and to pay their
annual assessments to the treasurer of
the Associated Students and criticized
this action, which Is particularly preva
lent among the women students. He
said: ,
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. ?0.â
Assembly Hall was crowded to overflow
ing this morning by the students and
faculty assembled to nsten to President
Jordan's address to the freshmen class.
This was the first general assembly cf
the college year and the hail was made
to echo with the familiar songs and >â¢Â«!!.<.
Previous to the address by the president.
Instructor Putnam of the English de
partment announced that Charles Froh
man, under the direction of^Ben Grec-t.
would present the Shakespearean play.
"Twelfth Night." on the night of Septem
ber a and "Everyman" the following
night. The productions will be under tha
auspices of the English Club.
President Jordan in giving his annual
address to the freshmen spoke in part as
follows:
You know what I am going to say â the up
per classmen have told you and they are to
help to enforce the lesson. They will tell you
that the university is part of life, that Its
methods are those of life â no statutes set up
for you to break, but when you go wrong you
come into collision with the universe. That
tha few rules exist in the nature of things:
that men who bruik them are not wanted
here, but are "escorted to the edge of the cam
pus^and dropped off." ThiÂ« Is not because
erty Is forbidden by the faculty, but because
drunkards, rowdies, vandals and idlers are not
worth educating, or, at any rate, not worth
education so choice as we try to furnish here.
We do not forbid visiting saloons, but those
who do this will very soon find their work neg
lected and a UttlÂ« pink card will remind them
that Stanford is only a reminiscence. We do
not go out of our way to forbid hazing, but
you know that we regafri men who use phy
sical force in their trirks on boys as cowards
and sneaks. \V> da not require you to attend
your classes, but those who neglect them are
marked for speedy return to the bosoms ot
their families. The freshman class of this
year has been sifted more closely than any
other I know of here or anywhere else.
Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
She swore positively that she never
went out sleigh riding with Joseph L.
White In New York and never told him
that she knew of the divorce. She fur
ther testified that she never read the
summons or complaint In the divorce pro
ceedings to White's mother.
Both sides rested their case and the
court set next Thursday morning for ar
gument of the case. At the conclusion
of the arguments the case of Jennie
White against the executors of the es
tate of Jonathan Lloyd White will come
up. She alleges In her complaint that
she loaned her husband the sum of $16,300
with which as a basis he accumulated his
large fortune. She now demands the re
turn of this sum with interest.
In order to prove the genuineness of the
signature Theodore F. Kytka, the hand
writing expert, was put on the stand yes
terday morning and gave it as his opin
ion that the signatures were written by
Mrs. White. He based his opinion on ex
emplars furnished him by counsel and on
his sixteen years' experience. Kytka
had large photographs of the signatures
and with these he pointed out the simi
larity in the handwriting.
The attorneys for Mrs. "WhitÂ© deemed it
best not to cross-examine the handwrit
ing expert.
Richard H. Morrison, the executor of
the estate who witnessed the slcnlng of
the paper, was called by the plaintiff for
further cross-examination. Judge Altken
attempted to shake the witness on his
knowledge of New York, but failed. He
also tried to break down Morrison's tes
timony in regard to the signing of the
document, but did not meet with great
success. Morrison proved a shrewd wit
ness and stuck to his original story.
Charles G. Gebhardt, another executor
of the estate, was called to the stand by
the defense and stated that he had, In
company with other executors and of
ficials of the Safe Deposit Company,
opened the lock-box of the deceased and
found a receipt for $6 alleged to have
been signed by the process server who
handed Mrs. Jennie White the summons
and subpena in the divorce case, filed by
deceased a few years before his death.
Mrs. Charlotte McLaughlin of 1954 Bu
chanan street and Mrs. Kmma G. Hart,
living at 1315 Filbert street, were called
by the plaintiff to testify that the repu
tation of Joseph L. White, a brother of
the deceased, was bad. This testimony
was given in order to rebut that given
by White before the commissioner in
New York, when he testified that one
evening he was out riding with Mrs. Jen
nie White and she told him that she no
longer was his sister-in-law, as Lloyd
White had secured a divorce from her.
Mrs. Jennie White took the stand In
her own behalf and admitted that her
signature waa affixed to the receipt for
$1250, but swore she never knew the con
tents of the paper. She says the paper
was signed in the rooms of the Safe De
posit vaults and that it was very dark
In there. She further testified that her
husband handed her a folded paper and
said: "Here, Jenn sign this," and in
obedience to his request she signed the
paper.
On Thursday morning next arguments
will be heard in the White case, which
has been on for hearing before Judge
Troutt during the past two weeks. Both
side*s\have put in all their evidence and
nothing remains but the addresses of the
attorneys in the case.
Up to the time the attorneys for the de
fense brought forth the receipt signed by
Mrs. Jennie White for $1250, the plain
tiff's case had a roseate hue. This re
ceipt Is alleged to have been signed by
Mrs. White in the presence of Richard
H. Morrison, an executor of the estate
of Jonathan Lloyd White, deceased. The
plaintiff was startled, as were her coun
sel, when the attorneys for the defense
sprung the document and Mrs. White
was loud in her denial of having ever
seen the paper.
ALAMEDA, Sept. 10.â There was filed
by City Attorney M. W. Simpson to-day a
demurrer to the petition for an alternate
writ of mandamus obtained by the Board
of Trade to compel the City Trustees to
submit the matter of the disposition of
tha two local railroad franchises to the
voters of Alameda under the referendum
ordinance, jj There is a possibility that if
the demurrer is argued to-morrow the
temporary injunction against the City
Trustees may be>dlssolved before October
2. the time set for reviewing the petition.
It is set forth in the demurrer that the
petition upon which the alternative writ
was issued does not contain sufficient
cause for action and states that the City
Trustees have done nothing either offi
cially or unofficially which would indicate
that the municipal legislators intended to
ignore the request of COO citizojas that the
question of the franchises be submitted
to a popular vote.
Henry Rosentlial. president of the
'Board of Trade, has called a meeting of
that organization, to be held to-morrow
night in room. No. 11 in the Methodist
Church block, for the ostensible purpose
of discussing the existing situation with
respect to the franchises. An Invitation
has also been extended to the public to be
present.
Sandy Ferguson, who is to fight Jack
Johnson at Colma next month, is due
here early next week. He will be taken
In hand by Tim McGrath, who will train
him for the fight at the Beach Tavern.
Billy Wood of Los Angeles offers to
stop Harry Foley and another middle
weight on the same night.
Martin Canole is anxious to come to
this coast and fight any man weighing
from 128 to 133 pounds.
Frank Neil returned from Los Angeles
last night. Ho is anxious to take Young
Corbett's place in the proposed match
with Ben Jordan, the English champion.
Corbett has won considerable money bet
ting on the races and will not talk fight
for the present. Neil's pluck is to be
admired, as he would be giving away from
seven to nine pounds to Jordan. Neil al
lowed De Coursey seven pounds. This
is an object-lesson to the fighters who
haggle over a pound. The Los Angeles
club wants Nell to fight i'eltz or Reagan
next month.
J. E. Cahlll, who is managing George
Fuller, a clever lightweight, is trying
ihard to secure a match for his man. He
offers to fight Billy Otts at 138 pounds at
6 o'clock, but the latter wants to weigh
in at 142 pounds. Fuller also has his
eyes on the winner of the Angeli-Cordell
match. He has had a number of suc
cessful fights. He has boxed with Britt,
Fitzgerald and Gans in training and they
have all complimented him on his clever
ness.
The sporting writers of the Eastern pa
pers are'a unit on the proposition that
Jack Monroe has not a ghost of a chance
with Jeffries. Monroe is also, apparently,
aware of that fact and intends to make
all the money possible out of his^next
ring engagement.
He wants to meet Jeffries in this city,
where he knows the returns will be great
er than in Los Angeles. This is one fight
the men of .this city who enjoy boxing
would not support. No boxing promoter
would have the temerity to try it on tne
public. Here i3 an Eastern writer's esti
mate of Monroe and it is in keeping with
the others:
I saw Monroe tried out after he "got the
decision" over the champion. It was in
Woods' gymnasium with Tom Carey, "The
Jabber," a poor one at beet. Monroe worked
all that was in him. He did not know that
any one was taking notes.
Even Carey raado him look llkÂ« a novice,
and then we â Johnny Mack, now matchmaker
of the Tammany Athletic Club of Boston, and
myself â knew that he wouldn't do in any pre
pared going with Jeffries or any other of the
first-class heavyweights.
Monroe is bit;, strong and young, but he is
slow as molasses in February and doesn't
know enough about the boxing game to last
him ' over night.
He /would not bo a serious proposition for
any of them. ' Fitzslmmons. Corbett. Huhlin,
Martin/ Jack Johnson or Armstrong. He
might pair off with Sharkey. but even the
sailor would whip him.
With the exception of a little testimony
in rebuttal the evidence in the case of i
Victor Walkirez, charged with the mur
der of Elizabeth Leroy, is completed. It
is expected that the arguments will be
gin to-morrow and possibly the case be
submitted by nightfaJl. The accused did
not take the stand.
The day was spent in listening to the
testimony cf Mrs. Fannie Wall and Hat
tie Cochrane, two colored women, who
testified their belief that at times Wal
kirez â¢was not mentally sound. It was
late this afternoon when the defense
Ftated that it rested its case.
Mrs. Wall, the first witness called to
the stand, stated that she had lived near
the Presidio, in San Francfsco, in 1900
and had met Wilklrez in the general hos
pital there. Later he had called at her
house and at times acted 6trangely.
Hattle Cochrane testified to having
known Walkiroz intimately and while she
would not say that he was crazy she
thought at times he was out of his head.
Sheriff John Bishop was called to show
that he had stopped religious meetings in
il.e County Jail on account of the effect
tiiey had on the prisoner, but the testi
mony was not allowed by the Judge.

HIS Droadway, Sept. 10.
The intending forester must have a pe
culiar temperament, a sympathy with the
'forest and tree. One of the first qualifi
cations is observation and a facility fe-r
diganosing the case of the tree accurate
ly. The forester must have a thorough
knowledge of forestry measurements and
every forest problem in mathematics. He
must know lumbering, for lumbering is
.even more closely related to forestry than
botany. The essential problem of it all
is the growing and harvesting of the
crops, to know what timber is on the
ground, how fast it is growing, what are
its uses, how it is logged.
It is a profession that requires robust
health, for there is nothing more trying
and Intellectually wearing than forestry.
There is some risk, too, which is to be
measured in proportion to the newness
of the industry and the number of men
In it.
The value of forestry as a profession,
he said, depends on the opportunities
which it offers in a half dozen ways for
the forester to come into touch with the
nation's greatest activities. In order to
be successful in forestry one must not
study it for itself alone, but in cohnec
tion with other things. The student must
know law and commerce and history and
many of the facts affecting the com
mercial elde of the case. Then, after
knowing all these things he must be con
tent with a reasonable salary, which will
not be near as large an income as that
of a successful civil engineer or law
yer.
Mr. Pinchot delivered an address in the
Students' Observatory this afternoon on
"The Study of Forestry as a Profession
Tor Young Men." In this lecture he di
lated upon the more obvious aspects of
forestry as a means of livelihood.
PROFESSION OF FORESTRY.
Still another field of activity is the Philip
pine Islands, where the Government owns
40.000.000 acres of timbered land. The Govern
ment has been trying to get foresters to go to
the Islands, but the demand so far exceeds the
supply that it Is a difficult thing to get men
to go. And since American foresters are de
sired for the work, they must be trained. â¢
Forestry is a profession for which a highly
specialized training is required and the time
has now come when the trained forester will be
of the most use. The forestry problem on the
Pacific Coast cannot be solved without trained
foretters and they must be Americans who can
deal with on American problem in an Ameri
can way. The need for foresters is perhaps
paramount to the need for forest protection and
that need can only be furnished by men trained
in a regularly established school that in my
opinion should be established somewhere on the
Pacific Coast and In Celifornia,
It is possible by Â«uch forestration to Increase
the water supply, and where water Is of such
value as it is In this State undoubtedly the
work should be done.
There is always a demand for foresters to
care forv these large areas of wooded lands.
Not only this, but there exists a demand for
foresters who may know how to replant de
nuded lands and to provide for the extension
of the forest where, trees do not now grow.
The amount of standing lumber west of the
Mississippi is about 1.000.000.000,000 feet. Of
this amount there is in California 185.000,000,-
OtO feet; In Washington. 200.000,000,000 feet,
and In Oregon 275.000,000,000 feet, making a
total for the coast of GÂ«o. COO. 000, 000 feet.
STANDING LUMBER.
GifTord Pinchot of the Forestry Bureau,
of the United States Department of Agri
culture advocates a school of forestry
for California In which men can be
trained and sent out Into the forests,
commissioned to save the trees from the
Â¦wanton destruction of the woodmen's ax
and the fires and to make trees grow
where none grew before.
Mr. Pinchot expressed his opinion this
evening at the University of California,
where lie delivered an address in the
Students' Observatorjv on "A Proposed
P'orest School for California." In all the
wide west, he said, there is no regularly
organized school of forestry, and where
there are such immense numbers of acres
of -woods and such wealthy interests
there should be something of that kind.
California is the best place' for such a
school, which should be for the recep
tion of graduates only, who would be re
quired to undergo at least a two-year
post-graduate course, he said. In his ad
dress Mr. Pinchot showed why there is
such a demand for a school and for
foresters, saying in part:
There is going to be a large demand for for
esters for the foreit reeerves west of the Mis
sissippi and especially on the Pacific Coast.
There are t5O2.O0a.0OO acres of forest reserves
this side of the Mississippi now and the num
ber is being constantly increased. There is
also going to be a demand from the States
for foresters. Applications are being made all
the time at the Bureau jt Forestry in Wash
ington for assistants. The large lumbermen,
too, are working constantly In the direction of
forest preservation and th?y are engaging for
esters for their lands.

He attempted to pick his hat from the
ground without dismounting and the girth
being slack the saddle turned and he was
thrown to the ground, one foot being en
tangled In the stirrup.
Pugh Â«s an expert rider and had done
this cowboy trick many times. Ho had
been making a tour of Contra Costa and
Alameda counties with Mr. and Mrs.
Ralph Stocker and they were on their
way home between Pleasanton and Dub
lin when a puff of wind blew off Pugh'B
hat. Turning his horse hÂ© galloped back
after it. As the horseman neared the
spot where the hat lay he threw himself
far over to one side in order to reach
down, and fell off. The horse continued
on its way for some distance, but finally
stopped with Pugh still dangling at the
stirrup, bruised and bleeding. His friends
were driving and they took him into
their vehicle and drove him into Pleasan
ton, where medical aid was secured. Lat
er he was removed to his home on Twen
ty-fourth street in this city.

LONDON, Sept. 10.â The British For

sentations at Washington anent the re
cent seizure of two or three inlands off
the northeast coast of Eiitish Xorth Bor
neo by the United States gunboat Quiros.
These islands are not connected with
those off the coast of Sandakan (capital
of British North Borneo) over which the
American flag was recently hoisted.
The Quiros is stated to have lately vis
ited a port on the northeast coast of Bor
neo and to have thence steamed to Dar.
vel Bay, an important center in Borneo,
150 miles southward. There the seizure
is said to have occurred. The islands,
which have been under British adminis
tration for the last twenty-five years,
were originally infested by pirates who
were driven out by . the Chartered Com
pany of Borneo. The action of the Qui
ros was brought to the attention of the
Foreign Office, which then took up the
matter.
It is asserted at the Foreign Office that
the whole question of the is!and3 is now
under consideration at I^ondon and in
Washington, and that when Foreign Sec
retary Lansdowne returns arbitration will
be suggested.

THE Japanese liner Hongkong
Maru arrived yesterday from the
Orient. She brought 157 passen
gers and 2500 tons of freight The
latter Included 591 bales of raw
silk, valued at $375,000, and 13,900 boxes of
tea.
W. H. A very, the agent here for the
Toyo Kisen Kalsha, returned on the
Hongkong. With Mrs. Avery he has
been visiting the Orient partly on busi
ness, but managing to get out of the trip
a full measure of pleasure, a deep coat of
tan and a rich store of good health. One
of the objects of Avery' s visit to the
Orient was the inspection of the Ham
1 burg- American Company's liners Ham
burg and Kaitchow, which the Toyo
Kisen Kaisha contemplated buying for
the run between here and the Orient Al
though fitted most palatially. Avery
thought the vessels had too much in the
way of upperworks for the service and
on his recommendation the purchase was
not made.
The company has long contemplated
building one or more new vessels for this
run and will probably do so shortly, al
though, according to Avery, no contracts
have yet been made. The new ships, ac
cording to original intentions, will be ves
j sels of about 12,000 tons, with a speed of
nineteen knots. If built they will be con
structed at Nagasaki. " ' - 1

Monday will close the show In this city
with performances afternoon and even
ing. There will be two performances
every day until then, including Sunday.
To the children the most attractive fea
'urr- is the funny work of the clowns. Of
thfse thrre are a multitude and they are
irresistibly comical. They work In
bunches all around the hippodrome and
all cf their business is new and original.
One of the features is when a well gown
ed woman walks afong apparently looking
for a seat. She Is accosted by one of the
clowns, to whom she administers a thor
ough drubbing in the most approved eci
entlfic fashion. As she retraces her way
Rhe is the recipient of cheers and no doubt
many in the audience really think she is
.-in entirely voluntary contributor to the
show.
The troupe cf trained elephants is a
wonderful example of what animal knowl
edge and training can develop. To see
these cumbersome brutes attain a degree
of r.imbleness and docility seldom found
in dogs is almost beyond belief. They
hoist their huge carcasses into all kinds
of positions and perform in spaces that
give scarcely room for their ample feet.
Owing to the reaction after a bunch of
holidays which characterized the week
the attendance at R'ngling Bros', circus
yesterday afternoon fell oft a bit, but at
r.ight tine the big tent was again taxed
to its full capacity.
As with previous performances every
thing went with a dash and there was not
a moment from the time the first cru
haders appeared in the spectacle of "Je
rusalem" to the neck-and-neck finish in
the chariot race that the four rings were
empty cf splendid attractions.
This is the only aggregation of its kind
that hag made good all its promises.
There is ret a weak feature in the entire
rerformance. The bareback riding is es
pecially good and while it is not featured
above ether acts, as was the circus cus
tom in previous years, there is a suf
ficiency of high class equestrianism to
stand cut clearly among the attractions.
The quality of the horses in the various
performances is worthy of comment. All
<.f them are superior animals, full of vim
and fire and tiieir handling Requires the
highest degree of skill and nerve.
Multitude of Attractions Are
Presented Without Any
Waits.
Splendid Performance Is
Repeated to Full

The only chanee is a further decline in
Bran. Hay continues In heavy receipt and
is easy in consequence. The circular of Som
ers & Co. says: "There seems to be but little
diminution in shipments of Hay, the total
for the week being 50CO tons, or only 100 tons
less than for the week preceding. Nothing
of Interest has occurred on the market in any
way. The daily arrivals continue to consist
very largely of the medium grades of Hay
only, and the situation remains practically un
changed, with choice wheat Hay In good de
mand, and a fancy car of same, occasionally
selling at an advance on regular quotations.
We are convinced that we are nearing the
end of our heavy shipments, for the report
comes from many districts that the worst is
now ovor and that before the end of the
month the fields will be cleaned.
"With reference to the outlook during the
winter everythlns seems to point toward an
advance on present quotations. There has
been such a general tendency to buy quite
heavily on the part of the dealers throughout
the country that in some sections the entire
crop has been purchased and marketed. To
these districts Hay will have to be shipped
back to supply them during the winter, and
already we i.ote some inquiry toward this end.
With a continuance of the coastwise demand
we should have a fairly active market during
the winter, so although no extreme â¢ figures
may be looked for yet. It may be reasonably
expected that there will be sufficient advance
over present prices to well repay the cost of
carrying Hay in the country.
"The Government order has not been let as
yet. but bids will be submitted this week.
Should the contract be awarded In this city it
may tend to help market conditions here some
what."

CHICAGO. Sept. 10.â The wheat market
was steady at about yesterday's figures. An
easier tone soon prevailed, however. Inducing
some bearish report, commission houses and
long holders letting go considerable quantities.
December closed at Sl%ig81Â»ic.
Continued mild weather in the corn belt
brought out quantities of long corn, and al
though local bulls offered considerable support
early prices continued to sag". Commission
houses generally were on the selling side and
shorts who had covered on the froet scare put
out their lines. December sold down from the
opening, 51c to 51'i@50%c. closing at 50%@
50 %e.
There was general good buying in oats, in
fiuenctd by heavy rains' In many sections. De
cember ruled strong, closing %c higher at
37<&c after ranging between 37%@37%c.
Yesterday's strength in provisions held to
day butm a less degree, pork being up at
its best 25c. but easing off on liquidation by
longs with profits. There was a light run of
hogs and local traders gave the market sup
port. Closing prlcea were $13 80 for October
I>ork a gain of 20c. with lard up 17%c at
$S 47% and ribs 10c higher at $8 SO.

The local demand for fruits was steady, and
as strictly high-grade stock was in somewhat
limited supply, prices for that class of goods
were well sustained. Peaches were the firmest
article on the list. The canners were still of
fering $25 per ton for clingstones, but offer
ings in bulk were disposed of to the regular
trade at better prices. Bartlett Pears were
easier. A carload came in from Southern Ore
gon, part of which sold to the trade at $1@1 25
per box, the balance going to the canners at
$40 per ton. Winter Pears and trashy Apples
were abundant and dull. Good sound Apples
met with a good demand at steady rates.
Prunes were in free supply, but as the demand
was better prices showed more firmness.
Plums have about had their run and the quota
tions are withdrawn. Figs arrived freely from
several sections and sold slowly at easier
prices. Pomegranates and Quinces were duh.
Watermelons were fairly actH'e and steady,
while Cantaloupes and Nutmeg Melons were
higher under a brisk demand and light re
ceipts. Table Grapes were plentiful and easy
except for fancy Seedless nnd Isabella. Five
crates of the white Comichon variety cam* in
from Alma and sold at 75&85c per crate.
Wine Grapes arrived freely from Antloch and
Oakley and moved slowly. Very few sales
were reported above $2t per ton. Huckleber
ries were steady under a good demand, but
other Berries were easier, receipts being ample,
the carryover large and the demand light.
The market was bare of Mexican Limes. A
steamer arrived from Mexico late in the day
with several hundred cases, most of which had
been sold to arrive. The fresh arrivals will
be marketed to-day. Oranges. Lemons and Ba
nanas stood as previously quoted.
One or two cars of Cape Cod Cranberries are

The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"Several sources of anxiety c#the Stock Ex
change are either disappearing or have become
much less acute than at any time this year.
Among these are the monetary outlook, the
<rop situation, the Furply of undigested securi
ties, the labor agitation ar.d the cotton corner.
It is perfectly correct to say mat all of these
iroLlems are much less perplexing to-day than
et any time since their creation, and the prob
ability is that the distrust which they bave en
tendered will gradually disappear in the ab
sence of further unfavorable developments. Re
actionary forces have already led to some re
covery, undue despondency is passing away and
values are gradually rising to a level more com
rr.enturate.with present conditions. Specula
tive activity cactlnues llniifd. partly be-cauf"
at holidays and partly because confidence is
pvl fully restored, but chiefly because the mar
ket leaders fre not yet prepared for an ag
Â£r.*6Â£ive camj-aigTi. Many cf the large oper
ators are still absent, and those who control
lig lending institutions very rroperiy wish to
i^ee a satisfactory outcome of money and crop

"'The money outlook is much better than an-
H^j.at.K! a few months ago. Crop demands are
now commencing and will expand for pome
wÂ«>k* to come. The West may be better able
t.-> finance the crop than usual, but the -Ira'.n

at declining reserves. While the ro

this pÂ«riod for the last two years. Speculative
locu'.rereents havÂ« been much reduced and tiie
willingness of the Secretary at the Treasury to
$40 000,000 of Internal revenue receipts
in an'Â»menjMiey makes the monetary prospect

says of Salmon In Liverpool :
"As anticipated last week, prices have
jumped up very considerably and limits are
about Is 6d?I2s Cd above these that ruled this
day week. There is every likelihood that Sal

There is a good demand for all the best brands,

which have dragged very much of late." '

Northern Wheat Market.
1 extreme weakness of the eteel stocks, which
were sold in large volume, was a disturbing
feature. Stories concerning the action to be
taken on the dividend of steel common, to
gether with adverse trade reports, were freely
circulated, but neither confirmation nor denial
was obtainable from authoritative sources.
Another stock that showed marked weakness
in the early tension was Brooklyn Transit, the
result. It Is said, of a pool dissolution.
Norfolk and Western scored a 1-polnt ad
vance at the opening. Trading relapsed into
extreme dullnÂ«BÂ» in the second hour and the
drift of pticts was again downward. The re
duction in the price of Southern piglron prob
ably influenced the 1>4 per cent decline in
Tennessee Coal and Iron and was not without
1 effect on ether stocks of that class. Colorado
Fuel advanced 2 points for no apparent rea
son.
Business came almost to a standstill In the
early afternoon, but there was some covering
of short contracts, and prices hanienpd In some
Instances, onjy to lose their improvement later.
For the rest of the day business continued
dull, and aside from the further large offerings
and increased weakness 01" the United Stales
Steel stocks, together with some liquidation of
Atchison. the late session was almost feature
less, and closing jirices were generally at the
lowest, only a ftw issues, suoh as St. Paul
and the l^acifles, in the list of standard rail
road chares and some of the class specialties
displaying comparative firmness. London's
operations here were nominal, the only note
worthy feature being the heavy selling of steel.
These issues closed with a net loss of IVj for
the common and l'-j for the preferred.
The bond market lacked feature and moved
irregularly on a small range. Total sales,
$'J20,0UU. United States bonds were all un
changed en the last call.

But through Want Ads in The Dally Call
Success is sure and quick.The University Mound and Bay View
Improvement clubs have sent the follow
ing communication to the Health Board
relative to the condition of affairs in
Butchertown:
The University Mound and Bay View Im
provement clubs dot-ire hereby to call your at
tention to certain facts in relation to that por
tion of the city and county of San Francisco
known and designated as "Butchertown."
The various firms engaged in the business of
slaughtering cattle, sheep, hdgs and other ani
mals within the limits of the city and icounty
of San Franclaco carry on their business in
thirty-six Cit>) blocks of land, situated in the
Potrero. These blocks of land were granted to
certain persons for the butchers by act of .Leg
islature found In the statutes of 1S69 and 1S70.
It was provided in that act that if at any time
the conduct of the business of the butchering
within these limits should become a nuisance
and remain such for sixty days said grant
would become void and of no effect.
At the time these blocks were granted all
of them were covered by the ebb and now of
the tide. Since then, however, by the grading
of Railroad avenue Kentucky street and Fifth
and Seventh avenues, a large portion of these
lots are no longer under tide water and the de
posits of offal cause the place to be so offen
sive as to create a nuisance. The buildings
are old, having been there, since about 18t&.

The. committee thereupon postponed ac
tion on the Santa Fe's petition until next
Thursday ... f \ â¢ .
John ' and Maggie Trout of 1020
Mariposa street filed a protest against
granting the ' franchise \to the Santa Fe
Company. The reasons assigned are that
the adjoining property would depreciate
in value and if the franchise should be
granted that electricity Bhould be sub
stituted for steam.
The Real Estate and Development Com
pany, by Fred Clark president, repre
senting 1035 feet frontage, filed a petition
that the board grant- the application of
the Santa Fe Company for a franchise.
The petition recitea, . that the adjacent
property will find Its most important use
as sites for manufacturing and Industrial
enterprises, and to this end the fullest
possible development of railway service
Is essential.
The Santa Fe Company filed an amend
ed petition for a franchise so that the
route of the road will run from a point
at the Intersection of Arkansas and Six
teenth streets along Eighth and thence
along Fifteenth street, owing to protests
filed by* property owners.
"If you eliminate the building of the
viaduct and the reservation of a street
through the marketplace lots," continued
Kruttschnltt, "we will agree to contribute
$55,000 to the building of the Third street
bridge and " also convey a strip of land
twenty feet In width for the widening
of Kentucky street."
"The widening Qf Kentucky street
would be very desirable," said Grunsky,
and the committee expressed itself as- fa
voring the suggested compromise Im
provement.
In the afternoon the committee met
again and It was agreed that the term of
the ' franchise shalt be for fifty years.
Manson suggested that Sixteenth street
be widened by twenty, feet from Illinois
street to Potrero avenue, but Herrin said
the streets could be widened when neces
sary- Grunsky said the Western Pacific
Company had asked for a franchise at
the crossing of Tulare and Marln streets,
and It may be necessary to bridge over
certain streets.
sky, "and unless some mention Is made
of the proposition now the city may ex
perience difficulty In building the viaduct
in future years. The track system of the
Southern Pacific has practically closed
Fifth str'eet to traffic and the viaduct
will allow travel to the north and south
of Channel street. I think the city
should bear its share of the expense for
the viaduct."
"But the ordinance provides that the
company shall pay three-fourths and the
city only one-fourth of the cost," said
Herrin. "That Is not the city's share at
all."
"The necessity for the viaduct may not
arise for ten years," said Manson, "and
many cities in granting such valuable
privileges would not contribute one cent
for any required improvement."
"If all these conditions are forced upon
us," said Kruttschnitt, "we would be
compelled to change our entire plans, as a
viaduct would destroy the usefulness of
the terminal."
slaughter-houses should cither be moved cr re
built according to modern methods.
We therefore respectfully ask that your hon
orable board conduct an Investigation of ths
condition of affairs in P.utchertown. to the end
that an improvement of some kind be Â¦ mada.
Very respectfully,
UNIVERSITY MOUND AND BAY VIEW Ilf-
PROVEMKNT CLl'ISS. George II. .Roundly.
H. O. Taylor, Henry A. Tesamer, Executive
Committee.
"The viaduct may become an absolute
necessity in course' of time," said Grun-
John Deahl objected to leasing the
marketplace lots to the Southern -Pa
cific Company at $500 per month, claim
ing that the property should be rented to
the highest bidder.
Herrin suggested that it would be bet
ter to agree on a valuation of the lots, so
that the company could purchase them
outright.
Dcahl advised against immediate sale
of the land, saying that if the company
could afford to pay $150,000 at the present
time for the lots It could pay that sum
in five or ten years, as the property would
certainly not depreciate in value.
Herrin said it was absolutely inconsist
ent to reserve land for street purposes
on property to be rented to the company,
as the city had the power at any time to
open up streets.
"This is an important step in connec
tion with our doing business with San
Francisco," said Kruttschnitt, "and we
could not afford to take it with our ten
ure of the terminals as uncertain as the
ordinance would make It."
Grunsky said he had always pointed to
the value of the marketplace lots and
that a right of way through them is es
sential to protect the city's interest.
"We will not accept the franchise with
the stipulation for a^ street through the
land," said. Herrin.
"The committee will take this matter
under advisement," said Chairman Cur
tis.
"In view of the fact that we have
promised to spend $55,000 across Third
street we could not agree to build a via
duct across. Fifth street, which would
cost probably $p00,000," said Kruttschnltt.
"You have provided for a bridge on Six
teenth street for which we will have but
little use. I think we have been very
generous In this matter and the commit
tee should 'let up' a little on us."
VIADUCT .A NECESSITY.
OBJECTS TO LEASE.
Kruttschnltt objected to the reserva
tion of a strip of land sixty feet in width
for an entrance to the marketplace
claiming that it was a new proposition.
"It was understood," said Kruttschnltt,
"that the Southern Pacific Company
should contribute $55,000 toward building
a bridge across Third street, and we
think that Is all we should be required
to do."
These blocks are of especial value to the
railroad as they run through the center ,of
their land and if they secure possession of
them they will have a clear tract reaching
from Fourth to Sixth street, about 1700 feet
In length, and having a water frontagre on the
south side of Channel street for this entire
distance.
The communication, signed by E. P. E.
Troy, was read and recited that at the
rate that adjacent property was rented
the marketplace lots should be worth
$27,048 per year. The communication con
tinues: '
The proposed grant of franchise to the
Southern Pacific Company for a bay shore
line seems to be in a fair way of settle
ment as a result of the conference yes
terday between the Supervisors'^ Street
Committee and representatives of the
corporation. The committee had prepared
an ordinance providing for the grant and
had Imposed certain conditions therein to
â¢which the company took exception. These
included the building of a viaduct across
Fifth street and the laying out of a street
through the marketplace lots, which the
company Is desirous of leasing for Its ter
minal.
The company flatly refused to accept
either of the two foregoing conditions,
but afc a compromise voluntarily agreed
to donate the necessary land to Â¦ widen
Kentucky street twenty feet- for a dis
tance of a mile or more. The committee
did not formally agree to the compromise,
but It is understood that it will meet the
company half way and the ordinance pro
viding for the grant covering the condi
tions will be presented to the board at
next Monday's meeting, together with
the report of the committee on the sub
ject.
Representing the -company were Chief
Counsel Herrlr, General Manager
Kruttschnltt, Jere Burke and E. J.
Foulds. Besides the members of the
Street Committee â Supervisors Curtis,
Braunhart and Connor â there were pres
ent Supervisors Laughery and Wilson/
Commissioner of Works Manson and City
Engineer Grunsky.
AGREE ON RENTAL.
Herrln said he considered the rental of
the marketplace lots fixed at $500 per
month for the first five years as being
high, but he had agreed to the figure
made by the City Engineer.
"There is a citizen who does not agree
with you," said Braunhart. "He has filed
a communication which I would like to
have read."

Appointment of Elec
tion Officers Is Fully
Discussed.
Thomas D. Riordan, Dr. McNutt, A.
Ruef. Henry Ach, John Lynch and Jacob
Steppacher of the United Republican
League held a conference with closed
doors last night. The representatives of
the organization were together for nearly
two hours. Word was given at the close
of the session that the topic under dis
cussion related to the appointment of
election officers.
The Board of Election Commissioners
will soon be called upon to appoint near
ly 1000 officers of election. On behalf of
the Republican party the officers of the
United Republican League wfll ask \he
commission to give fair representation on
every precinct beard to the Republicans.
The request will be presented in proper
form at the meeting of the board next
Monday. It was said last evening that
subjects pertaining \ to the Mayoralty
were not discussed at the conference and
that ma tiers* connected with the # chair
manship of "the convention were not
broached.
It transpires that several active mem
bers of the league are not quite satisfied
with the proposed plan of giving to each
district delegation the absolute power to
name one nominee for the Board of Su
pervisors. It is hinted that two or three
of the districts have practically agreed
to recommend for nomination men who
are not in the iirst rank of citizenship.
The Forty-fourth Assembly District
Republican delegation met last night at
1G Geary street. Owing to the absence of
four of the twenty-two delegates it was
decided to defer the election of chairman
of the delegation, until next Monday
evening. It was resolved that a commit
tee of six should be appointed to wait
upon unregistered voters and those who
have changed their residence since the
last election and induce them to visit tlrc
City Hall immediately in order that they
may register anew for the coming elec
tion. The Forty-fourth District contains
more registered, voters than any other
Assembly District !n the city and the
delegates are desirous of holding the rec
ord in this respect. The district con
tains many new apartment houses.

"Three other brothers, John, Joseph
and Tony, are still at the rancli," but,
the girl says, her father is continually
quarreling with them. Pelletier says that
he Is will|ng to wait until his sweetheart
is eighteen years of age and will marry
her then. He says he can gain his
mother's consent.
"My father refuses to allow any of his
daughters to wed," said Miss Pimentell
last night. "I have four sisters and two
of them have run away to be married
like myself. One, Mrs. Belle Enez, was
married when she was fourteen years
old, is divorced and is now living In Palo
Alto. Another, Mrs. Annie Rodriguez,
residing at 00S Sansome street, was mar
ried when she was sixteen years old. 1 1
was stopping with her when the detect
ive came and arrested me. One of my
brothers, Frank, ran away from home
when he was seventeen years old and Is
now living in Santa Clara,
"My father is severe In his treatment
of us all. We have been required to
work hard and frequently he has threat
ened Us and beaten us. Another sister,
Mary Pimentell, also ran away from
home.
Rosie Pimentell, a rancher's daughter
of Pescadero, and Charles Pelletier, who
resides at 17G1 Howard street In this city,
were taken into custody and placed in
the city prison by Detective Bell last
evening. Both eloped from San Mateo
County and both are under th,e legal age,
the girl being seventeen years and three
months and the boy seventeen years and
six months.
The arrest was made at the request of
the girl's father, Manuel J. Pimentell. It
is alleged that Pelletier met his daughter
two years ago while he was camping in
the neighborhood of the ranch and that
'three weeks ago he secured a job about
the place that he might be near his lady
.love. On last Saturday Pimentell dis
covered that the boy was In love with his
daughter and discharged him. On Tues
day the persistent lover drove to the
ranch, eloped with the girl and arrived
in this city on Wednesday.. The father
followed and the arrest was determined
upon.
During the trial many of the most
prominent merchants and citizens of the
Chinese quarter were called upon to give
their testimony. Many prominent mem
bers of the Six Companies exerted all
their influence to have the accused men
acquitted, but the evidence against them
was too strong.
Last March Detective Ed Gibson no
ticed the two Chinese acting suspiciously
in a room at 61S Merchant street, In the
rear of the Hall of Justice. Gibson noti
fied Secret Service Agent Hazen and he
immediately began an investigation with
startling results.
Hazen and his deputies watched the
place for several days without being ob
served, and discovered that the two Chi
namen were going In for the exclusive
making of fifty-cent pieces on an elab
orate scale. A complete set of tools was
discovered by the officers, together with
a number of coins, all ready for circula
tion.
The coins were made of pure silver and
were nearly perfect in every way. Great
skill and 'perseverance had been exercized
in their manufacture and they resembled
the Mint output so closely that It was al
most impossible to detect the ' difference.
After several days of waiting the offi
cers finally surprised the two Chinese and
each one at once tried to shift the blame
to the other. In so doing each made
many damaging admissions, which went
against them during the trial.
The pair were put on trial soon after
their capture, but the jury disagreed. At
the second trial the evidence was so com
plete and the testimony of the officers so
damaging that the jury brought in a ver
dict of guilty after fifteen minutes' delib
eration. The prisoners will be sentenced
on the 19th.
The . final chapter in an interesting
counterfeiting case was closed in Judge
de Haven's department of the United
States District Court yesterday, when
Lee Lung, alias Jim Lee, and Lee Fung,
alias Ah Wong, were convicted of mak
ing bogus money. The case was a sensa
tional one and brought to light many
facts concerning the making of counter
feit money by the Chinese.

Still struggling for what he claimed was

counties 2j per cent, then 20 p~r cent, 15
per cent, and finally 5 per cent, but each
time he failed to secure a second to his
motion, lie raid Baa Francisco had been
assessed in the first place fully as high
as it should have been and he protested
apainst what be asserted would be un
just di scrim irLaticvn.
Alford. eariy in the session, attempted
to secure the passage of a resolution low
ering the San Frascisco assessment roll
li per cer.t from the figures submitted by
Assessor Dodge. He also attempted to
have a resolution passed reducing the as
sessment of Los Angeles County 15 per
cent and allotring the assessments of all
other counties to remain as fixed by the
different County Assessors. In both in
stances, however, Aiford was the only
supporter cf the resolutions. He made a
strong protest against the action of the
beard in what he claimed was the singling
out of San Francisco to stand more than
Its burden of taxation. He referred often
to the figures cf Assessor Dodge in sup

In view of the rapid increase of their*
business, to move into larger quarters,
and therefore they took a long lease on
tho entire live-story new building at Post
and Kearny streets, and sold out at the
lowest prices on record practically every
last season's garment in stock so as to
move in with an entirely new stock.
They were offered such a largo bonus for
thpif lease, however, that it was business
policy to accept it. They did so and will
remodel their present quarters as soon
as the rush of new shipments is over.
There an- none but new garments at

tion has been raised, thu= increasing our taxes.
This notion of the board Is a discouragement
to me personally, ny it much of the relief to
certain 'real estate ami buildings, which I had
hoped to afford by Just reductions in valuations
and by properly assessing other classes of prop
erty, has been made impossible.
â¢ One point which few taxpayers understand,
is that this' raise in valuation applies only to
the assfFsmpnt for State purposes at the State
rate. Tho valuation tor city and county pur
poses remains the same as that, fixed by me,
on which our local rate of ?l 07, as fixed by
our Board of Sui^rviKors in July, will be col
lected San Ftanebjeo without this raise would
have paid to the tUate as taxes $2.81S,200;
! with it we will be obliged to pay $3,052,000.
In conclusion let me mention a. siKniticant
â¢ circumstance, whlcn may or may not show thÂ»
I value of any evidence presented by San Fran
cisco County or any ether county to the State
I board. The State rate, had the valuations re
turned by County Assessors been allowed to
itand. would have been 06 cent*. Several
Â¦n-pcks ago befpr* this â¢â¢investigation" by the
State board began. It was remarked by a cer
tain State official that the State rate could be
reduced 10 cents by adding $1SO,OCO,CCO to the
roll One hundred and seventy-eight million
dollar- have been added after the "Investiga
tion" by the board, and the State rate Is re
duced 10 cents, or to 50.1 cents from 6U cents.
BURDEN FOR THE CITY.
The State board, not satisfied with a valua
tion of $l,:i.J4,otO.COO on property in the State,
other than railrord property (which is twice
i what it war. in 1834). raises the assessment on
i the sanw to $l.'fil2,'00%000 > . but permits the as
! sessmerits on railroads to remain unchanged,
j although it is far less than it was in 1SS4.
The earning capacity of the roads has been
quadrupled, millions have been spent on im
provements, yet the assessment per mile Is
much lets than formerly. The whole increase
: might have with more justice, been added to
! the railroad's. Nevada and Montana have re-
I contly Increased the assessment of their rall
1 roads far beyond ours, althouRh their roads
; are far less valuable, having but a fraction of
\the earning capacity of our roads.
Thus it Is Â£fen that th.o railroads of the State
are not made by the State Board to stand any
part of this raise-. It Is all put on other prop
erty. Were the railroads assessed up to other
property this discrimination in their favor
would be unjust, but when they are assessed
at about onp-half w!;at other property Jn the
State is; then this action by the State Board
in placing no part of the increase on them be
comes an outrage en the taxpayers of the
State and Is a travesty on justice. This action
of the board raises tho assessment of all prop
erty in San Francisco of whatever character,
except. money and solvent credits. That is it
raises the asf-esFmfnt of all land, dwellings or
buildings, furniture, stocks of merchandise
and in fact every class of personal property.
FAVOR FOE. BAILROADS.
ASSESSOR DODGE made the fol
lowing statement last night In re
lation to the State Board of
Equalization increasing the as
sessments :
I do not object to the State board increasing
the assessment roll of the State provided the
board complWs with two conditions. â¢ese
arcâ first, make the railroads that are as
sessed by the board Itself, stand their proper
proportion of the raise; and second, avoid
putting an unjust share of the raise on this
city and county. Both of these conditions
have been discarded by the board. The as
sessment of the steam railroads of the fatate
was made at practically the same valuation
as tho assessment of these roads last year
by the board. . . .. . .
The total assessment so made by the board
of every steam railroad in the State. Central
Pacific. Southern Pacific. 1 ; Santa Fe, and all
other road^ is only $31,000,000. This in
cludes their' rolliB&r stock, roadbed, roadway
and franchise Why, the street railroads of
San Francisco are assessed on a valuation
more than one-fourth of this entire sum. This
assessment made by the board on steam rail
roads is at u certain rate per mile on the
roads. In spite of the fact that the roads
have incrtasfd enormously in value, owing to
increased iraftic. the assessment thereon has
been decreased.
