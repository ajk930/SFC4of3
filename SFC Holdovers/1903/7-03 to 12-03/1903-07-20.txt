UNKNOWN MAN WHO MET MYSTERIOUS DEATH, EVIDENTLY AT I
THE HANDS OF ASSASSINS. AND INCIDENTS OF THE LAST FEW
HOURS OF HIS LIFE. AS RELATED BY THOSE WHO SAW HIM.
Last night about thirty unmasked men,
riding in perfect order, came up the east
bank of the Big Horn, dismounted, teth
ered their horses and compelled the ferry
man to take them across the river They
made no demonstration until they entered
Basin, when five shots were fired as a
warning. The mob proceeded at once .to
the building which Is courthouse and jail
combined and fired a volley into the Jail.
Deputy C. E. Price and Special Deputy
George S. Mead were guarding the pris
oners at, the time. One bullet grazed
Mead's shoulder and entered Price's head,
killing him.
Members (f the mob then quickly pro
cured telephone poles and battered down
the jail doors. They first came to Wal
ters, who was crouched on his cot, pit
eously begging for mercy. No needless
torture was resorted. to; Walters was
shot instantly.
The mob next fired on Gorman, whose
body was pierced by five bullets and he
was left presumably dead* He lingered,
however, until 8:30 o'clock this morning.
He made no statement, but asked to see
Maggie Gorman, his accomplice. She was
far away and his dying request could not
be^grunted.
. Its -work; done, , the mob quickly and
It was reported to Sheriff Fenton last
Wednesday morning that a mob was
coming up to Basin along the Big Horn
River from Hyattsville and Tenstep to
lynch Gorman and Walters. As a meas
ure, of precaution the Sheriff took these
two men and a horse thief out of jail and
secured them in a gully near town under
guard of Deputy Sheriffs Felix Alston and
C. E. Price. Gorman, who has exception
ally small hands, managed to slip off his
handcuffs and escape. Deputy Price fired
a shot at the fugitive as he disappeared
In the brush, but the bullet went wide.
Gorman swam the Big Horn River ana
made for the mountains. A posse quickly
organized and Gorman was recaptured
early yesterday .morning on Trapper
Creek, about fifty miles from Basin. From
Wednesday until Saturday morning he
had not eaten a mouthful of food, and
he was exceedingly weak. He had no
firearms and offered no resistance.
SWEARS IN MORE DEPUTIES.
In the meantime Sheriff Fenton had re
placed Walters and the horse thief in the
Basin jail. Last evening Gorman also
was taken to the Jail and a force of fif
teen deputies was sworn in.
Feeling has been running high among
tho ranchers for a long time. Gorman's
crime was considered an atrocious one.
A year ago he shot his brother Thomas
at the latter's ranch on Sheel Creek, near
Thermopolis, and then fled with Thomas
Gorman's wife, Maggie, who is held as an
accomplice in the crime but is out on bail.
Gorman had two trials, each resulting in
a sentence of death by hanging, but his
attorney fought the case stubbornly and
took an appeal to the Supreme Court. The
ranchers believed justice would be de
feated.
Waltero was a traveling man who fell
in love with Mrs. Hoover. She refused to
marry him and he shot her. This was
about two years ago, and justice had been
delayed in his case also, though he had
been sentenced to death.

RUMORS OF DEATH
JH^OME, July 19. â The final crisis has come, and has come
&& when Cardinals, monsignors and doctors thought it most
distant; when the Pope's illness had entered on a period
of amelioration and his Holiness himself declared he felt better.
His illness, however, had brought Leo XIII to the borderland of
his final agony, and his 94 years will accomplish the rest.
He is not dying of any malady, for his pleurisy is nearly
cured. He is dying of old age and because the various organs
of his body have ceased to work as they should. His heart has
become weaker than any other organ. Its weak state causes it
to beat with extraordinary rapidity. The movement even reached
ninety-nine beats per minute. When the heart reaches such a
number of beats it is bound to become fatigued and may stop sud
denly at any moment.
Dissolution, however, will take place without agony, unless
one terms agony the terrible state of collapse into which his Holi
ness fell last night and which continued all of to-day and to
night.
The Pope, looking like a corpse, is lying with his eyes closed
and his head buried in the pillows. There is not the slightest
movement of any part of his body and his Holiness does not ut
ter a single word.
All is as silent as the grave in the chamber in which the life
of Leo XIII is ebbing. One must draw near to the emaciated
body of his Holiness, lying motionless under the sheets, to per
ceive that it is still in life and to see the chest rise and fall with
the last effort of the lungs. Around the bed are grouped Mgr.
Piffari, Dr. Lapponi and Valet Centra.
The other doctors simply limited their visit to a few minutes,
from necessity, to see that his Holiness was passing calmly away.
Every possible preparation for the death of the Pope has already
been made. Even printed notices announcing the fatal event,
which will be affixed to the doors of the various churches, have
been got ready.
During the whole day Rome newspapers of all shades of
opinion, from Catholic to Liberal, numerous editions
regarding the progress of the crisis in the Pope's illness from time
to time. It was, indeed, rumored that his Holiness was dead.
There was, however, no great crowd in St. Peter's square, on
account of the tremendous heat. - To-day has been the hottest day
Rome has had in a year. The mercury arose slowly to 98 in the
shade. This was already excessive heat, but it continued to rise
until on the shady side of St. Peter's square it arose to 107 de
grees.
It was not until the approach of sunset that the population of
Rome'began to pour toward the large square in front of the Vat
ican to await the signal of the death of a Pope, which is given by
the big bell of /St. Peter's.
As the authority of Leo XIII has almost disappeared, that
of the Cardinal Camerlingo, Cardinal Oreglia, has taken its place,
and new orders were issued at the Vatican. Yesterday and this
morning it was still easy to enter the building, but this evening
this became almost impossible. The result was that from time to
time the rumor' circulated that the Pope was dead, but at about 7
o'clock the Cardinals, who nearly all came to' obtain news of the
Pope's condition, left the Vatican one after the other. This is
proof that the danger of death is not immediate, as they should all
be present at the instant his Holiness expired.
Two Cardinals, however, did not leave the Vatican â Cardi
nal Serafino Vannutelli, whose duty it is to certify to the death,
and Cardinal Oreglia, who has already taken over the direction
of the Vatican. For the first time since the beginning of the
Pope's illness they have now taken up their residence in the
apartments they will occupy till the election of the new Pope.

About 11 o'clock this forenoon the fog

wreck to-morrow, and assist. the' tugs in
making fast to the. wreck.
The tug C. B. Smith, Captain Smith, of
Everett heard the distress signals of the
sinking steamer, and going alongside took
on board all who had not already taken
to the steamer's boats. Then she passed
a hawser aboard and started for the
shore with the North Pacific in tow. , The
tug . finally grounded at Marrowstone
Point and her master sang out to the
North Pacific to let go her anchor. At
the same time the tug cast off her
hawser. The anchor failed to hold the
steamer and she disappeared in the fog.
Fortunately It was the first trip the
North Pacific had made for some time and
consequently she had only fourteen pas
sengers. The fact that it was not gener
ally known that the steamer was on the
run ' accounts for her small passsenger
list. The passsengers and crew were
given food and shelter by Keeper Morgan
of the Marrowstone Point Lighthouse
and this forenoon eleven passsengers were
taken aboard the steamer Mainlander,
which had run ashore at Marrowstone
Point, but easily backed off when the tide
flooded. The crew and balance of the
passengers were taken to Seattle on the
Mainlander.
The side-wheel steamer North Pacific,
which ran on the route between Seattle
and Vapcouver, struck on Craven Rock
this morning near Marrowstone Point
during a dense fog. The vessel began to
leak badly and when it became apparent
that she would sink an attempt was made
to beach her.
The belief is attributed to the Japanese
that the Russian policy is to attempt to
placate Great Britain and America and
provoke Japan Into beginning hostilities.
They regard Russia's consent to opening
ports In Manchuria, the Czar's promised
vis'.t to England and the occupation of
the Korean border as part of that policy.
I Russia's activity on the Yalu River Is
more irriatlng to Japan than the reten
tion of Manchuria and all Japanese offi
cials In China speak of war as a "proba
bility."
YOKOHAMA, July 19.â M. Pavleff, the
Russian Minister at Seoul, capital of
Korea, has had an audience with the Em
pcror of Korea at which he opposed the
opening of Wiju. the port on the Yalu
River, the opening of which was asked
fry Great Britain and Japan.
Eastern situation is the increasing danger
of war between Russia and Japan. They
believe it is becoming plain that Russia
Is willing to fight Japan if convinced that
no other powers will assist her. The Rus
sians are confident of their ability to
easily defeat Japan and are said to be
anxious to settle definitely her position
in western politics and end her ambitions
to oppose Russia's progress in Manchuria.

China and Japan, which he will look into
during his stay there.
E. O. McCormick. passenger traffic man
ager of the Southern Pacific Company,
returned last night from Chicago, whither
he went several weeks ago to attend a
meeting of the transcontinental passen

settled by the agents was the fixing of
special rates for various conventions to
be held on the coast this and the following
year, among them being that of the
Bankers' Association in October, the
Knights Templar In September of next
year, j the National Live Stock Associa
tion in Portland in January. 1904, and sev

which have been allowed a $30 rate, simi

Mr. McCormick says the indications are
that the attendance at the G. A. R. En

expectations. He also confirmed the story
published in 'The Call several days ago to
the effect that no successor will be ap

only a superficial examination, not wish-

members of the papal household his Holi

ROME,- July 19, 11:35 a. m.-During the
night and morning the restlessness of the
Pope continually grew greater and he be
c&me most agitated. His Holiness could
find no peace In any position, and called
frequently upon Dr. Lapponi and his
valet. Centra, who did all in their power
to calm him, but without avail, the Pon
tiff saying he fc!t a nervousness which
prevented him keeping still.
. Notwithstanding the efforts made, very
little nourishment was -taken and the
strength of the Pope is hourly ebbing and
has reached such a low point that he csto
not move alone in bed, requiring help,
and never finding a position that Is satis
factory. At 6 o'clock this mornings Pope
Leo fsaid:
"I never felt so ill as I do now. Hurry
Marzolini here. I wish to hear mass and
receive communion, which may prove to
be the last." ' . .: , '
Restlessness of the Patient Is Fol
lowed by Delirium.
The medical aspect of the Pope's case
is exciting much discussion. One relia-
Lle authority, having opportunity of
knowing the private history and the
treatment, declares that a third opera
tion for the removal of the liquid secre
tion In the pleura has actually been per
formed,, but has not been made public, in
order to avoid increasing the public ap
prehension.
It is also said In the same reliable
quarter that Dr. Lapponi and Dr. Maz
zoni have made a written statement be
fore a notary giving the exact details of
the Pope's case and that copies of these
statements have been deposited with Car
dinal Rampolla and Monsignor Cagiano
<le Azevedo, the major domo of his Holi
ness. The purpose of this statement Is
to answer possible subsequent medical
criticisms on the treatment of the case.
It is understood that the doctors have
not been as frank in their bulletins as
they personally desired to bs, details of
some features of the case being withheld
at the earnest request of the Vatican
authorities. Their formal statement Is
expected to clear up the entire
history of the case.

STORY TOLD BY BULLETINS.
At this hour but few persons remain at
the Vatican, ur. Mazzoni and Dr. Ros
sor.l and the Cardinals have gone to their
homes to await the last urgent summons.
"The Pope at the present moment is in
a state of coma, which may be called a
condition preceding the last agony, the
duration of which it is imposible to fore
cast, although everything leads to the be
lief that this condition cannot last. To
be more exact, he is still in a state of tor
por and stupor, from which, however, he
rouses occasionally, when he hears sharp
soundsâ as, for instance, the insistent
voice of one of his familiars calling loudly
to him. Left alone, he relapses immedi
ately into a condition of torpor. At in
tervals he murmurs In his sleep, continu
ing to have forebodings that he is being
abandoned by his valet. Centra, and my
self. These are the symptoms of incipi
ent cerebral anaemia and general exhaus
tion. He can no longer turn in his bed
without assistance and is being kept alive
by artificial stimulants. During the last
twenty-three hours he has had two injec
tions of camphorated oil. three of caffeine
and two hypodermic injections of salt
water, besides drinking stimulants."
Â¦ Monsipnor -.. Bislotti, master of the
Pope's chamber, said earlier in the even-
Ing that the pulse of his Holiness had not
yet shown &nv sign of becoming Inter
mittent, eo despite his extreme weakness
and coma he believed the Pope would sur
vive the night and possibly to-morrow.
Both the Italian Government and the
authorities of the Vatican have made
final preparations for the Pope's death.
The Government is rigidly censoring all
telegrams and telephonic communications
between Italy and the rest of the Conti
nent.
Dr. Lapponi Says Pope Cannot Long
Survive Present Condition.
ROME, July 19-midnight.â The Pope
lies to-night in a etate of coma and there
are grave doubts in the minds of his doc
tors whether he will ever completely
emerge. His Immediate dissolution seems
to be diverted only by the activity of his
heart. His pulse, though weak, continues
steady. Shortly before midnight -Dr.
Lapponi said:

The Vatican authorities are deeply ap
preciative of this expression by the
American people and recall the cordial
personal exchanges between the Presi
dent and the, Pope when the volumes of
Presidential messages and papal encycli

ROME, July 20. 1:15 a. m.â Although the
condition of the Pope is unchanged and
coma continues, all about'the Vatican is
quiet except the apartments of the Pon
tiff, it being thought that a catastrophe
will not occur during the night. A con
tributing element to the weakness of the
Pope has been his Inability to take nour
ishment. When an attempt Is made to
administer restoratives, although they
are placed in his mouth, he does not
swallow them. The Vatican has asked
for prayers for the august head of the
church at this supreme moment.
ROME. July 20. 2:40 a. m.â A sucniclm
has arisen that the change In the Pope'i
condition is due to bioou poisoning us a
result of derangement of the Kidneys.

MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT.
ROME. July 19. 10:15 p. m.â The. Pope
has had an attack of delirium. The end
appears inevitable.
After the visit of the physicians Cardi
nal Rampolla called to get full details of
his report of the Pontiffs condition.
The rumor that the Pope was worse
was soon spread through the city, and
the usual rush to the Vatican began
Several Cardinals hurried to the Vatican,
among them Cardinal Oreglia, who re
mained for a half hour and then left in
his stead Cardinal Serafino Vannutelli,
who as great penitentiary, bears the duty
of reciting prayers for the dying at the
last moment in the sickroom. Cardinal
Vannutelli remained at the Vatican, in
the apartment of the majordomo, in or
der that he might be ready for any call.
ROME, July 19. 12:45 p. m.â The Pope's
condition continues about the same, but
his Holiness is, if possible, somewhat
more restless and he calls frequently even
when his attendants are In the room.
The doctors do not think that another
operation Is advisable yet. They fear nojv.
that the heart may get too weak, induc
ing intermittence in its pulsations, which
would be fatal.
physicians have ordered that silence be
maintained In the. sickroom and that as
little speaking be done as possible: The
liquid in the pleura is apparently station
ary, but there is really a slight augmen
tation of it. as absorption even in the
6majlest degree must go on the whole
time.
statement that the relations with the
Roman church under the Pope have been
more satisfactory than previously. Car
dinal Rampolla, who is mainly .instru
mental in establishing the Russian diplo
matic mission at the Vatican, enjoys spe
cial favor at the department, where it Is
believed that his election would mean a
continuance of the good relations.
One of the finest gatherings of â¢ the
convention was the men's meeting in
Tent Ontario this afternoon, presided over
by B. F. Dieffendorf of tfanajoharie, N.
Y. There were 3500 men present, and
their voices swelling forth In "Onward,
Christian Soldiers," .the battle hymn of
the Epworth league, was one of ,the
Stirring effects of the convention.
We cannot affiliate with the Unitarians or
any other body that does not recognize Christ
as King. If we are right in our belief and as
sertion of his kingship, they are unwittingly
honest blasphemers. If they are right, we are
idolaters. We must everywhere declare and
maintain belief in his deity. . I would be will
ing to receive an honest doubter Into the
church, but if he dogmatically declares that
Christ is not God, I would be as willing to re
ceive a Mormon.
The gigantic Iniquity of the Anglo-Saxon race
is a fostering of the monstrous traffic in intoxi
cants. We believe tho complete dtsfranchts;
ment of the buslnew will abolish dangers that
threaten us and clear up problems that per
plex us.
â¢ This whole evil organization 'is a foundation
of iniquity whose streams poison wherever they
flow. It has no redeeming feature. It is an
environment of perdition, hence we set our
faces against this enemy of God and '.will give
it no quarter In social life, in " politicsâ In fact,
nowhere until it Is relegated to Its own place.
The greatest throng that has crowded
in Tent Ontario during the convention
was present to-night.- The 6000 seats
were occupied" and at least 2000 people
were standing about the edges-ofthe tent.
Dr. J. M.- Buckley of New jYork'was the
iirst speaker, discussing "Christ, Our
King.'.' He said in part: ;
OPPOSE SALE OF LIQUOR.
As<in the past, we .stand for the broadest
Christian fraternity; .We hall with special sat
isfaction every opportunity for practical co-op
eration with our. people's societies in
Christian ministry and service. Â¦ * â¢
We consider ourselves- called to the work of
personal evangelism, and we enjoin -an our
members to enter the field*, now wnite for har
vest. Vie stand for a present, art abundant
and a conscious salvation as essential to that
power of witnessing which wins meji. /We
thus send. out to the young hosts of our imn?a
Methodism this" appeal for prayerâ a holy wait
ing at the morning watch, a pleading of the
promises of the opening' book for a revival
which may mean to the twentieth century what
the revival of Wesley was to the eighteenth
century and to the world. Â¦ ... ,
' Epworth Leaguerir, let us to our knees that
we may wield the Fpirlts* blade.
To us as to the youngr people of no other age
comes the trumpet call : "Go ye into all the

eyes, we behold in -many lands gospel oppor
tunities rapidly becoming gospel emergencies.
To remain ignorant or Indifferent to the cause
of miteions is to sirt against light and to ig
nore the will of God. We. a part of Christ's

may be evangelized in our generation.

Toward night the reports from the sick |
r6ofn continued to be of "a graver charac- i
ter. "Cardinal : Delia Vorpe, coming: from,
the Vatican, said he had held a brief con
versation with Dr. Lapponi. and. thai', the
latter'had mgide the following statement:;
"If nothing new happens the patient may
live until to-morrow' morning, perhaps uh-'
til evening, maybe twenty-four hours.. Be- 1
yo'nd this survival Is hopeless." ' '
Following the departure of the Cardinals
a number of carriages were stationed in 1
the courtyard of San Damaso.in readiness;
to bring the Cardinals to the Vatican'-when ;
the catastrophe seemed imminent.
Among the Cardinals who came to the
Vatican to-day was Cardinal Oreglia, of
the Sacred College, upon whom will fall
the chief duty of directing affairs when
the Pope's death occurs. . He went to the
apartments, which have already been pre
pared for his residence at the Vatican,
in anticipation of his speedy assumption
of the Important duties he will be called
upon to perform. Later, however, he left
the Vatican. Â¦..*.. ,. .. v :, . '
Cardinal Scrafino VannutelH. the great
penitentiary, also arrived, in'readiness to
perform his office of "reciting prayers for
the dying Pontiff. He remained at the
Vatican continuously, throughout the aft
ernoonvand evening. ' Â¦ , . ââ¢
The Pope,' with a great effort, raised a
trembling: hand and in an almost inaud
ible voice, between long pauses, gave the
Cardinal the pontifical blessing.
The "effort, however, appeared to have
been too much for him and he, fell back
into a condition of unconsciousness. Â¦
Pontiff Lies at threshold of Death.
yet an imminent catastrophe is hardly
expected, as the state of coma may be
prolonged many hours." > ;
Meantime the critical condition of the
Pontiff has caused Intense excitement
throughout the city. When the state of
coma first occurred the doctors formally
communlcated the gravity of the condi
tion of his Holiness to Cardinal Ram
polla, who in turn advised the Cardinals
of the Sacred College. At the same time
the general public became aware of the
alarming change in the Pope's condition,
and the entrance to the Vatican was soon
thronged by dignitaries of the church
and members of the diplomatic corps,
making anxious inquiries. Twice rumors
of the death of the Pontiff gained circu
lation. The Cardinals and diplomats, upon
their arrival were informed .of the grav
ity of the situation, but many of them
left upon learning that the rumors of the
Pope's death were untrue.
The condition of coma, was interrupted
shortly after sunset. Cardinal Vives ' y
Tuto and Monsignor Pifferi. the*: Pope's
confessor, were immediately' called >into
the sick rooml They began .to" repeat
Latin prayers. The familiar sound of"the
language which Loo' XIII loved eo well
penetrated to his couch and r the Pope
seemed roused from his stupor and showed
signs of consclouness. He lifted his head.
Cardinal Vives y Tuto took advantage of
this conditian to approach- the bed and
tell the Pope^that some Cardinals were
in the chamber. Â¦ -'
"It Is my desire," said he, "to have your
benediction." Â¦ Â¦ . ' , i
"The Pope's condition to-night is worse
than this morning or last night, and.
while the end may come at any moment.
Their night bulletin announced for the
first time that their patient had been in
a state of coma, which, they said, had
been almost uninterrupted during the
day. How long this condition would
continue they did not venture to say. As
Dr. Lapponi came from the sick room at
11 o'clock this evening for a brief breath
of fresh air he summed up the steady
decline in the patient's condition by say
ing:
Almost immediately he sank Into a
Etate of complete exhaustion. At first
this took on the character of an unnat
ural sleep and he lay as one inanimate,
with his eyes closed. But occasionally he
started up and cried out as though in
fear. Gradually, however, his sleep be
came heavier and assumed a condition of
Femi-conseiousness, or torpor. After
noon there was hardly any revival from
this continued state of torpor and the
doctors remained continuously in attend
ance.
The distinguished patient appeared to
have lost all of that vitality which he had
hitherto so remarkably maintained. He
appealed p'teously to those about him.
siskin?; not to be left alone. Although
his mental vigor was nearly exhausted,
he again asked that mass be celebrated.
This was performed in the room adjoin
ing that in which the -Pontiff lay. He
foilowed the ceremony and took commun
ion with extreme difficulty.
He had spent a restless night, sleeping
for only chort intervals and even then
his eleep was agitated. Dr. Dapponl rf
cained in the sick room throughout the
right. At the morning conference the
physicians noted a distinct change for
the worse, particularly in the accelerated
pulse, which had risen to 95, after re
maining for many days between S8 and
90.
â^OME. July IS.â To-day each hour
tj has added to the gravity of the
/\Â£ reports from the sick room of the
Pontiff, until ail Rome has awaited
almost breathlessly. In momentary ex
pectation cf the announcement of his
death. Since the ntate of depression
which seized upon the Pope during the
latter part of the night, his condition has
ronÂ© steadily downward and throughout
the day Intense- anxiety has prevailed.
For the first time, also, the weather
was strongly against him. A blistering
heat fell upon the city and the great
piazza of St. Peter took up the fierce sun
find threw it back against the Vatican,
until it was like a furnace. Evefy light
breeze that prevailed came in hot waves
from 'the South. This seriously added to
the discomfort of the patient.

HEADQUARTERS SAN FRAN
CISCO CALL, CAMPKENNEDY,-
SANTA CLARA, July 19.â The
military mass held in camp this
morning was extremely impressive. Hun
dreds of residents of Santa Clara and
vicinity attended the solemn services. The
Rev. Father Philip O'Ryan, spiritual di
rector of the regiment, was celebrant.
The cadets were formed in a hollow square
facing the temporary altar. The staff of
ficers and band occupied places in the
center and the parishioners stood on
either side and took part in the services.
The altar was erected beneath the
Stars and Stripes. The candle, cruets,
massbook and other articles necessary in
the mass were brought from the parish
church. The altar was decorated by Miss
Eva Fitzpatrick, Miss Mary Hall, Miss
Lena Scanlon, Miss Mazy Tevlln, Miss
Nellie Scanlon and Miss Lily Fitzpatrick.
Harry Solen and James O'Dea of the
Hospital Corps acted as acolytes. ' and
Sam Piercy beat the drum at the eleva
tion.
During the service the guards paced up
and down and the young soldiers stood at
parade rest. At the Sanctus the drum was
sounded in place of the bell which is al
ways heard in church. At the elevation
Colonel Power gave the order, "Present
sabers." and 400 blades flashed in the
sunlight. The sight was an impressive
ono and was enjoyed by thousands of
spectators. The band rendered sacred
music throughout- the services. . Father
O'Ryan took occasion to admonish the
cadets about their behavior while in camp
and in the city. His sermon was as fol
lows:
WORDS OF COUNSEL.
My text is taken from the holy gospel of St.
John. vll:l 5-21. At that time Jesus said to
his disciples, "Beware of the false invader."
In this gospel, my dear friends, our Lord gives
us the rule and the practical test of a genuine
Christian. He tells us by their fruits we shall
know them; not by their professions; not merely
by the Hveries that they wear; not bx what
they say or .what they believe, but by what
they do. The religion ot Jesus Christ Is a re
ligion which should govern every act of oura
every day of our lives, and therefore Its true
test is what we do in action.
Now. my dear young friends, all of you are
followers of our blessed Lord. All of you are
bound to htm by a solemn obligation andxthat
Is the obligation of temperance. Down here
tn this valley, where you are unknown, people
will Judge all of you Just as our Savior said
man would ._ Judge of his followers by their
fruits. It Is to be you. It Is not by the name
you have or' by the uniform you wear, but by
the way you conduct yourself, and if you can't
stand that test, then you are "false prophets
and ravenous wojves."
Therefore, boys, your first and foremost duty
is to do nothing that will give scandal or cause
reproach upon you or upon us. You arc bound
by a pledge of temperance, every one of you.
Let no one dare violate that ptedge during the
week, because when you leave here your re
ligion and the "principles which you stand tor
will be' Judged, by the things you do during
the week. I, therefore, hope that not one of
you will do anything to cause disgrace or bring
discredit or pain to your organization.
After the services the regiment dis
persed and the routine of the day was
resumed. Major Morrisey Inspected each
tent and criticized some of the occupants
for not keeping their temporary homes In
better condition. He complimented oth
ers for the military manner In which they
had arranged their apparel.
Guard mount was watched by a large
crowd. The young soldiers went througrn
the ceremony without a break. , Lieuten

LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE
SHOWS HEALTHIER FEELING
Humors of Trouble in the Far East
Produce Little' Effect on
Securities.
LONDON, July 19.â The week on the
Stock Exchange closed with a healthier
feeling in the American market, and the
easier monetary condition had a steady
ing effect all around. The weakness of
Americans had an unfavorable influence
on all speculative stocks and the feeling
is still exceedingly nervous, principally
owing to the unprecedented and inexplica
ble nature of the slump. A hopeful aspect
of the situation, however, Is the fact that
the low prices of Americans/particularly
of the better class of these securities, at
tracted numerous Investors. The other
markets were almost inactive. The ru
mors of trouble in the Far East have had
so far little effect on Russian or Japanese
securtles.

BATTLE IS IMPENDING.
An alarming state of affairs is reported
from the vicinity of Thermopolis. About
six weeks ago, as a result of a range
feud that has been bitterly waged, Ben
jamin Minnick. a eheep owner, was killed
by cattlemen. Sheriff Fenton pursued
and arrested the alleged murderers, who
are prominent cattlemen, and whose
names have been withheld. On account
of threats made against him Sheriff'Fen
ton Is unable to get his prisoners to the
Basin. It is claimed that the same mob
that lynched Gorman and Walters, or its
sympathizers, have declared that the
Sheriff will never get out of the locality
alive with his prisoners. Sheriff Fenton
has wired to the Governor of Wyoming
for permission to use the State militia at
Landers, and also has sent a telephone
message to Cody Basin, Meeteetse \ and
other Wyoming points, asking for volun
teers to assist him in upholding the law.
Everywhere hardy Westerners are re
sponding to the call, arming themselves
and hastening toward Thermopolis. It is
probable that the militia also will be or
dered to the scene and that a fierce bat
tle will be fought.
The country about Thermopolis Is a
wild and'Tawlcss one. A message received
at Cody to-day from Sheriff Fenton
stated that he still had the prisoners and
that he believed he could hold out until
reinforcements came,

After hearing evidence and arguments
from both sides on a preliminary issue
the national board went into executive
session. President Lynch decided with
the union and Commissioner Driscoll with
the Review Publishing Company. Mr.
Driscoll then proposed that they proceed
to the selection of a third arbitrator, as
provided by the contract. Mr. Lynch re

been sitting in Spokane the past week as
a national board of arbitration, have
failed to accomplish the object of their
trip to this* city. President Lynch started
for the East to-day.
The failure resulted from President
Lynch refusing to assent to the selection
of a third arbitrator, as provided in the
arbitration contract between the Interna
tional Typographical Union and a large
number of American publishers. The na

LOS ANGELES. July 19.â Mine-owners
of Southern California, Southern Nevada

The torch was applied to the grass somo

reason for fear that the fire might not

soldiers, however, had not calculated on
the dryness of the field, and the slight
breeze that quickly caused a rush of

Governor Torres of Sonora Says That
They Have Ceased to Be
Revolutionists.
CITT OF MEXICO, July 15.â General
Luis Torres. Governor of the State of So
iiora and who has been actively in charge
of the campaign against the Yaqul In
dians during the past several years, has
made an official report to the War De
partment on the progress that has been
made in (jueillnff the rebellion. He says:
ThÂ» rebellious Indians have been reduced .In
riumlwrs to such a dcirrw that they are now
ehle to carry on hoMilitifs ecairist the authori
ties- only in' bands of frntn five to twenty-five.
They are In the tame situation its the Apaches
Tvere in thÂ» latfr yoars in the campaign of
General Miloj. Of lete the Ya<--ui* have con
fined therr.selve* purely to the comn-.lsslon of
rnurdfrs. thrlr victims invariably being stage
drivers and harmless Mexican laborers, whom
thry could surprise without resorting to the
warlike stratify of tlie early rebellion. The
.Yarju:* are r.o iorger revolutionists. They are
simply bandits.
There are still SO00 soldiers stationed in
Sonora and they have the situation well
in hand. They will be kept there until
the region lnfpsted by the Yaquis is thor
cuKhly settled. The fact that the Yaqui
Valley is the very best in Mexico for
orange growing is inducing many people
to settle there, and will have a great deal
to do with the elimination of the troubles.
DENOUNCES THE YAQUI
INDIANS AS BANDITS
The first night In camp will long be re
membered by the sadets. More noise wa3
generated in the wee sma" hours of the
morning than was ever heard in a boiler
factory. No one slept nor did any one at
temptto do so. Those who tried to play
an engagement with nature's sweet re
storer were rua>\ awakened from, their
dreams by having a tent fall on them.
Unearthly noises filled the air, and despite
the energetic work of the guard the
racket continued. The guardhouse was
filled to overflowing at an early ? hour.
Company C tried to beat the line at mid
night, and the men were captured 'and
taken Into camp In a body. The only
member of the company who was not
arrested stayed at a downtown hotel to
get some sleep.
The hospital corps, under the direction
of Major Morrisey, is ready for business.
The hospital tents " have been pitched
some distance from camp beneath the
shade of oak trees. No accidents have
happened, and the ambitious nurses are
disappointed. They want to show their
skill. Steward James O'Dea, R. J. Gar
rett. Lee Drossel. H. Solen, A. Burns, D.
McCarthy. T. Vaughn and P. Angelo are
In camp. On the arrival of the regiment
the hospital corps did good service.
Mrs. Gill and - Mrs. â¢ Burnden. residents
of Santa Clara, were Injured in a runaway
accident and the cadets went to their aid.
Doctor Morrisey attended the ladles, and
they were duly thankful.
The field music has 7 named Its street
"Haggerty boulevard" in honor of Lieu
tenant Colonel Peter Haggerty. Frank
Cresalia entertained a number of cadets
in the early hours of the morning with
a dissertation on good behavior. Cre
salia Is Inimitable as a mimic and he had
his auditors In a merry mood.
The members of the band are making
things lively in camp. When not play-
Ing music for the pleasure of the regi
ment the musicians form themselves into
a "Dutch" band and parade the camp,
filling the air with unearthly noises.
Lieutenant Williams has thirty men un
der him and expects to have ten more
before the week Is out. Sergeant^ Morris
and Quartermaster Sam Manafon ably
assist the leader in the excellent work.
Sergeant A. Smith of the Twenty-ninth
Coast Artillery. U. S. A., drill master of
Company B. will drill the regiment In ex

late in the afternoon. The command
turned out in khaki. The various evolu
tions were .watched with a great deal of
Interest by* the spectators.
During the past seven years, seven men
have held this position. Four of >hem
were killed while on duty and two of
the other three were forced to resign.
Many are apprehensive for the coming
week, although the troops are still here.
After the killing of Towa Marshal
Cockrill there was no one to make arrests
for more than a year, until the soldier3
arrived in May. Then City Judge Card
well, who had been a prisoner In his own
house for eighteen months, reopened
court. The two trustees have just ap
pointed Joseph Newland, who is con
sidered one of the bravest men in the
mountain districts, as town marshal.
Crawford and Tharp are still held on
the charge of firing Ewen's hotel Both
are teamsters for Hargls brothers and are
ably defended. As Ewen was held in
camp by the soldiers while his house was
burning he is not a witness in the arson
case, but he is the main witness in the
bribery case as well as the only eye wit
ness to the murder of Marcum. For that
reason it is feared- that trouble may be
gin when he returns here to-morrow from
Lexington to testify against a well known
citizen for offering him $3000 cash if he
would not testify against Jett and White.
In anticipation of the worst. Ewen, while
In Lexington made his will and arranged
all his affairs. About $4500 was raised for
him by popular subscription after he lost
everything he had In the incendiary fire.
Ewen has told the Commonwealth's at
torney. Byrd, and others the name of <hs
man who offered him the brtbo and as it
is said the accused has no means of his
own the bribery Investigation will ex
tend to the one who was to furnish the
funds.
JACKSON. Ky.. July 13.â A renewal of
the feud troubles is brewing fcere. The
special Grand Jury called by Circuit
Judge Redwine to investigate the charges
of attempting; to bribe B. I*. Even not
to testify against Curtisa Jett and Thomas
White in the Marcum murder case and
arson for burning of Ewen's Hotel, after
he had testified, convenes here to-mor
row. It is believed the Grand Jurors will
be asked to go into a sweeping inquiry
concerning conditions In Breathitt Coun
ty, where twenty-seven lives have been
lost since the Hargtt-CardweU feud
started. As yet no one has been punished
for any of these murders.
In the event of a general Inquisition
It is conceded that persons highly con
nected will be involved and that trials
for the killing of Dr. Cox and Town Mar
shal Cockrill will follow- close on the
second trial of Jett and White for the
murder of Marcum.
DE1CVER, July 19.â Between sixty and
seventy men from Missouri arrived here

BRYAN, it is announced, is to go to Europe to
study the social conditions of the people of
the leading nations. Before going he has ac
cepted an invitation to address a Democratic picnic
at Chicago, and has done his best to turn it into a
barbecue by serving up Cleveland and his Wall
street' friends well roasted for the delight of the
crowd. ' -"> . .
â¢The speech was a plea for "Democratic ideals,"
but contained no, specific declaration of a platform, a
policy, or a programme of statecraft. Devotion to
ideals among the Bryanites means evidently nothing
more than a determination to get even with,, the
goldbugs for their defection in 1806 and in 1900. The
speech, in fact, met all appeals for harmony with a
warwhoop and a scalp yell. , In a wild, barbaric yawp
it gave notice to all whom it might concern that if
any of the Cleveland combine should be nominated
by the Democracy next year Mr. Bryan would take
the stump and call upon the heavens to fall.
A' striking illustration of the extent to which
Bryan has become affected by something like a
mania with respect to Cleveland is shown in his as
sertion that his defeat in 1896 was due not to any-
A gang of scoundrels attempted recently at Iron
Mountain, Mich., to destroy by dynamite the prop
erty and life of a Judge. This appears to be a dis
agreeable and peculiarly new method of trying to

ability make dangerous the operations of rascals.

In this connection a remark made by one of the
heaviest and best-posted Wall street operators a day
or two ago is very suggestive. He said: "It is re
markable how many very rich men are short of cash
â¢at the moment." This says a good deal to the in
itiated. It means that the very rich have become
property poor and are getting rid of their property;
which consists of the famous "undigested securities,"
as rapidly as the stock market will allow them to do
it. This condition is more openly exhibited at Chi
cago than in New York. The great Chicago packers
do not hesitate to say that they are getting tired of
holding up the provision market by main strength
and that if it wants to decline, why, let it. But they
<io not talk in this way in New York.' Secrecy is
ihe rule there, and the public can do the guessing."
The staples stand about the same. Iron. and.steei
continue easy and whenever a change occurs it is
jjfeually in the direction of lower prices. Provisions
are weak. Live stock is becoming more numerous
throughout the country and prices show a slow down
ward tendency. Wool is firm and moving off well.
Cotton is quiet, with the mills steadily curtailing
production, both here and abroad. The bank clear
ings, though over $2,000,000,000 for. the week, show a
decrease of 5.7 per cent from the corresponding week
last year. The failures for the week were 173, against
174 last. year. The money market shows no change
worthy of note, and credits and collections are un
impaired in all sections. Briefly, the country is do
iss a la r Â£e, safe and profitable business. '
The feeling among the banks and large financial
interests is much more optimistic than among the
general public, which is still in the pessimistic vein
noted for the past few months and rather disposed
to '"short" the future. The financial interests are
pointing out that the monetary situation has greatly
improved, having been relieved and strengthened by
the heavy liquidation of the past six months; that the
bankisg capital of the country has been greatly en
larged during the past year; that there has been a
iarge increase in circulation; that heavy foreign loans
have been repaid; that onr borrowings in Europe
are many millions less than in the past year o.r two,
and "that the crop prospects are such that practically
good times are assured for another year. True; the
tendency in prices for most lines of goods is down
ward, but that is really a good thing, for they have
been altogether too high for the public welfare; but
the situation on the whole is very cheerful, when
comprehended, and not- such as to cause any sharp
and protracted shrinkage in the country's stock mar
ket. Talcing these facts into consideration it would
seem that the cause of the decline has been liquida
tion and that banking institutions and large financiers
have become tired of holding a lot of idle stocks and
bonds and are getting rid of them piecemeal at every
passing opportunity.
BUSINESS is still characterized by midsummer
apathy and presents hardly any features worthy
of comment. The improvement in the weath
er in the Eastern States still holds and is helping
things materially, especially the consumption of sum
mer goods, which makes retail trade lively and thus
indirectly expands the jobbing movement. It also
stimulates the fall demand for general merchandise
by helping the crops, and swells the railroad passen
ger earnings, especially on those lines that do a
iarge summer resort business. In fact, it is reported
that the present midsummer railroad traffic is the
largest ever known. So much for the weather.
The other prominent factor in trade is the labor
question, which is not nearly as acute as it .was some
time ago, as many strikes have closed, others have
been' averted and there is a growing disposition on
that part of the community that labors for a living
to iet well enough alone and auend to business for
awhile. Still, there are a good many strikes about
the "country and a good many others hanging fire,
atid "these tend to restrict trade, as frequently pointed
out during the past few months.
The course of the New York stock market has con
tinued mysterious during the past week, prices tum
bling and recovering without apparent cause, the only
explanation generally accepted being that liquidation
is not yet entirely over. There are still great blocks
of stocks to be disposed of and as soon as the mar
ket rallies these 2re ladled out with no unsparing
hand and prices go down again. This liquidation
must come to an end some time, and it is to be hoped
that that time is not distant.

The Epoca states the Spanish naval programme to be as
follows: Seven battleships of 13,000 tons; eight armored
cruisers, including five in hand, and three of a new type to
steam 22 knots; three cruisers of 25 knots speed; eight train
ing ships for general service and three training ships for
midshipmen. A number of submarine boats and other mis
cellaneous crafts are also included in the programme, the
cost of which will be between $130,000,000 and $140,000,000. A
general overhauling. and improvement of the several dock

Two Russian cruisers were launched June 2 â the Almaz
at St. Petersburg and Kagul at Nlcolalep on the Black
Sea. The Almaz was laid down September 23, 1301. and is
72 per cent completed. She is of 2385 tons displacement.
17,500 horsepower, but her speed is estimated at only 19
knot*, which is evidently an error, as the Boyavin of 3200
tons and 1S.0CO horsepower is credited with a speed of 25
knots. The Kagul. begun September 5, 1901, Is of the
Bogatyr type of 6675 tons displacement. 19.500 horsepower
and 23 knots speed. Both vessels are constructed entirely
of Russian material.
The Austrian armored Cruiser E, building to replace the
Ravetzky, is of 7400 tons displacement and 21 knots speed.
The notable circumstance about this ship is the fact of her
excessive cost, which is estimated at $4,774,000. The Brook

completed at a cost of $4,056,000. exclusive of speed premium

PERSONAL MENTION.
The battleships and other vessels of the United States
Navy built up to 1896 are beginning to become a heavy tax
on the naval appropriation for repairs, and some of the
ships will require repairs and reconstruction equal to one
third of their first cost in order to make them useful. The
armored cruiser New York,.' which went . Into commission
August 1, 1S93, has cost in repairs $518,000 up to July 1, 1902.
of which $241,500 was expended during 1900-1901, and the
vessel is now to receive repairs estimated to cost $500,000,
besides a new battery amounting to another half-a-mllllon.
Her first cost was $4,107,127 C>, exclusive of speed premium
and trial trip expenses. The Indiana, placed in commission
November 20, 1S95, at a cost of $5,937,447 57, has been known
in the navy for some years as "the lame duck." and will
require entire reconstruction if continued on the effective
list. Her repairs up to July 1, 1902, have amounted to
$4O8,S8O. The Iowa, in commission since June 16, 1S97, cost
$5,636,5S2 29 and her repairs up to July, 1902, foot up to
$220,189. The contemplated repairs and improvements to
this ship will require $1,000,000. The Massachusets, which
Is but slightly better than the Indiana. Is also In need of
reconstruction, and the Texas, upon which over $500,000 has
been expended in repairs since 1S95, is not likely to be worth
any considerable expense to continue her in active cruising
service.' The triple-screw cruisers Columbia and Minne
apolis are being overhauled preparatory for sea service,

A wooden brig for use in the training of landsmen and

kind to a navy yard which could be done at a private yard
tor $25,000. Senator Hale will not relleh the uncompliment
ary remarks made by the Syren " about his nnvy yard,
which asserts that work in the Kittery (Portsmouth) yard
costs from twice to six times that of similar kind in private
yards; that the work is never well done and that ships
repaired or refitted at the Kittery yard has to be done over
again at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, owing to the facts that
the yard has been run for many years without, regard to
business principles and most of the mechanics are
either farmers or lobster* catchers. â¢
THE two eteel sailing training ships, Cumberland and
Intrepid, are to be built at the Boston and Mare
Island Navy Yards respectively, at a cost not to
exceed $370,000 each, exclusive of equipment and armament.
They ore to be exactly alike, of 176 feet 5 ' Inches length

displacement of 1S00 tons on 16 feet 6^" Inch mean draught.
The building of these two ships will be watched with
'much Interest by the Navy Department and efforts will be
made in the two yards to make records. The Boston and
Mare Island Navy Yards are equally well equipped for such
work and the advantages which the former yard possesses
by proximity to material is more than offset by the climatic
conditions in California, which . will enable our workmen to

HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. '
Kansas led* the way. Quite a number of young
men of the "highest circles" in Topeka left their
offices, to seek a holiday, not in the woods or the
mountains, <but the grain fields. Instead of playing
golf with athletic girls, they have gone to hustling
with the harvest crews and rivaling one another in
doing justice to the suppers prepared by neat-handed
Phyllis of the farm.
Ohio started a little behind Kansas, but has sur
passed her. * Id the country papers of the Buckeye
State harvest items are now written up in a style
that resembles a cross between a report of a society
function and an account of a university event. A
specimen item from the Steubenville Gazette rnns
this way: "The hay harvest on the McDonald farm,
near Richmond, began to-day, and Mr. McDonald
was in the city Monday preparing to cut seventy-five
acres of the prettiest meadow in the country side.
The grass has doubled its growth in the last thirty
days and is now a green sea of beauty as it rises and
falls to the ripple of the midsummer breeze. Mr.
McDonald has secured a fine lot of harvesters fresh
from collegiate halls, who he expects to put up the
hay in the most scientific methods according to the
Greek and Latin lexicons touched off by Blackstone,
along with the latest Harvard and W. and J. stroke.
These harvesters are James McDonald of Harvard
University, Clifford McDonald and Finis Montgom
ery of W. and J., and Percy Laird, a legal light from
Pittsburg. Frank -Sinclair has -been, made general
manager of the harvest and has donned a n picturesque
regalia that is short-sleeved for the occasion. It will
be a grand week on the farm and when the hay is
down assistance will be lent in raking by Misses
Florence Donaldson and Marie and- Wilma. Sinclair,
who will be the house guests of Mrs. McDonald the
last of the week in time to play Maud Muller."
From the Eastern cities men of all trades are
hastening to the sport. A single company that set
out from New York recently contained painters,
printers, tailors, plumbers, telegraphers, sailors and
one man in search of a cure for malaria. College
men, however, are most numerous. As a rule they
engage special cars and go where the wheat fields
call them in as much style as if they were going to a
football match. The "co-ed" is not missing from the
rush. To a labor agent in New York there went a
young woman described as "a college girl of athletic
propensities and pleasant appearance" who made in
quiries about the work, the sport or the function
of harvesting, and explained: "Where so many
young men are wanted I thought there might be
places for at least a few women."
The reasons given by college men for seeking the
fields are various. Doubtless some go for the sake
of earning money, many for the frolic and not a
few for a chance to see what harvest life is like.
One collegian wrote: "I want to do this work to
get in trim for football. I just finished six months'
training for rowing, and so you see I am in fine
form, but if I lay off I will get too stout. I came
down from the country when I heard about the col
lege boys going West and thought I would try doing
what the rest of the boys do."
So they run along, one after another, hastening to
the fields. The tinker and the tailor, the soldier and
the satlor, the college man and 'maiden who wish a
summer gay,, are all going to try. in the ripened
wheat and rye to make work a picnic at three dollars
a day. It is as|erted that a good many of the more
enterprising youths intend to go to the Dakotas after
leaving the wheat fields of the Valley States and
perhaps a few of them may venture as far as Califor
nia. It is a good venture as it goes and promises to
help the farmers without hurting the universities.
BY "reason of the demand in the States of the
Mississippi Valley for harvesters there has
been started among the young folks' of that
section and of the Atlantic cities a genuine harvest
craze. Many men and not a few women, representa
tives of all classes of youth, are hurrying to the' fields,
and farm news and society gossip are getting mixed
up in the papers. It promises to be about as merry
a harvest as any that ever happened and may result
in making the reaper, the header and the harvester
more popular than the automobile.

The net result of the new theory is that we live
not in a universe of matter or substance* but in a
universe of energy, and as one speculator puts it:
"Before the discovery of radioactivity, the idea of
intratomic energy was wholly unknown to science.
Its development now demonstrates the existence in
the universe of an amount of energy which has never
even been dreamed of. The conversion of atomic
potential energy into kinetic energy upon the sur
face of the sun, for* example, would furnish him a
supply of radiating power far in excess of that which
the accepted theory of meteors could supply. As it
has been said, what controls these gigantic forces is
still a mystery. The knowledge of their existence,
however, must alter our attitude toward inanimate
matter and make us regard the planet on which, we
live rather, as ' a storehouse stuffed with explosives
inconceivably more powerful than . any we know of
and possibly only awaiting a suitable detonator to
cause the earth to revert to chaos." : * Y
Crookes is reported to have said at Berlin: "Matter
and electricity are one and the same thing." He has
since recalled a statement of Kingdon Clifford:
"There is great reason to believe that every material
atom carries upon it a small electrical current, if
it does not Wholly consist of that current." Hum
phrey Davy is said to have speculated about "radiant
matter". and.?ough'l..for it as far back as 1809, and
Balzac. set forth a similar idea in developing a theory
of the transmutation of metals when he said: "This
explanation will become a commonplace when men
of science will recognize the great part played by
electricity in human thinking power."
A summary of the discussion in London says: "M.
Curie, the discoverer of radium, in- some wonderful
experiments at the Royal Institution, showed that
radium spontaneously and continuously disengaged
heat, rapidly affected photographic plates, even
through opaque bodies, discharged an electroscope
when merely brought in its vicinity and gave off
emanations similar to itself in constant and even vio
lent streams or radiations; in other words, the 120,000
ions which compose each atom of radium rotated so
violently. that they flew apart into original units. It
has been calculated, however, that this efflux 'from
radium is so infinitesimal that a square inch of sur
face would lose only one grain in ten thousand mil
lion years
"It will be seen that the whole theory in effect is
an astronomical one. Chemistry has, in fact, become
the astronomy of the infinitesimal."
Stones of that kind must be taken with a large
allowance for the infirmities of human credulity. In
the long run it will be found that^ radium, like the
Roentgen rav, has excited a vain hope in the breasts
of the sanguine and hurried them into believing too
muchf . That the new energy will b* found useful in
medicine and in surgery, as well as in other depart
ments of human work, is, of course, quite probable,
but it is not at all likely it will be found to work all
the cures that have been reported.
Nevertheless, the effect of the new discovery upon
science,is in all probability destined to be the greatest
resulting from any single discovery in the history of
the world/ It has already virtually led to an aban
donment of the old atomic theory, and may lead to
an abandonment of the belief in the existence of mat
ter. Sir William Crookes, in his address at Berlin,
intimated a willingness to" abandon the "substance"
theory of the universe and to accept a doctrine that
the whole range of material phenomena can be ex
plained in terms of electrical energy.
The declaration made by Crookes at Berlin has
been followed by similar declarations from leading
scientists at a recent conference at London. In an
especial degree Professor Curie of Paris, who dis
covered radium, and Professor Lodge of London
declared that. a great revolution is to take place in
scientific thought and teaching. The statements of
such leaders as these have had the effect of awaken
ing a widespread interest in the question, and it has
been disclosed that what Crookes and his followers
now assert to have been demonstrated is but a con
firmation of ideas put forth long ago by their fore
runners in scientific investigation.
-jr* tHEN the Roentgen ray was a new thing to
\/\/ science sanguine experimenters believed
V V that -they could make use of the new en
ergy as a curative for almost all forms of human ill.
It vcill be remembered that following the demonstra
tions of the working force of the newly discovered
ray we had extraordinary reports of wonders worked
by its remedial powers. Experience, however, soon
proved that most of the high expectations would
have to be abandoned. The Roentgen ray can do
much and is doing much in the service of man, but
it has fillen far short of enabling physicians to heal
every disease that comes before them.
We are now having a new outburst of expectancy
over the power of radium. Since the wonderful en
ergies of the new substance were disclosed to the
world we have been getting reports of marvelous
cures effected by its aid. One doctor is reported to
have enabled the deaf to hear, and another the blind
to see, by the mere application of the radium energy.
The latest report is that a physician in London cured
a "rodent cancer" by the use of radium. The report
adds: "The cancer Was exposed to radium four ex
posures of an hour each given at intervals of a few
days. In three weeks the diseased part was healing
nicely and in six weeks, .with two more exposures,
the cancerous growth disappeared, leaving not a scar
to. remember, it by." '

jectionable in.his own canvass, but to the popular
disgust with the second Cleveland administration.
He * even said that the heaviest handicap upon the
party to-day is. the fact that "the last Democratic
administration, that. we had .was more, subservient to
corporate dictation than any Republican administra
tion that had preceded it,and the record of that ad
ministration has been a millstone about the party's
neck ever since." %
The folly of that kind of talk on the part of a
political leader passes the reach of criticism. There
are no words in our. language that do justice to it.
It is clear that Mr. Bryan in renouncing all hope to
further retain command of the Democratic ship ha3
resolved to scuttle her and then rouse the crew to
such a pitch of mutiny that they .would rather drown
than work the pumps under new leaders. As the
matter stands now, Democratic politicians might as
well make arrangements to follow Bryan to Europe,
for there will be nothing for them , to do in this
country for many, a year to come.

On July 28 there will be a race for all
classes of the NewjYork Yacht Club fleet.
On the 29th will come the, second trial
race; on the 30th another regatta for the
fleet, and on Saturday,' August 1, the third
and last trial race. It Is conflcTently, ex
pected by the members of the club that
the Reliance will prove sufficiently able
to win all the trial races and be selected
to defend the cup.
The feature of the da\was the meeting
on board 'the Corsair of the America's
cup committee and the. regatta committee
of the New York -Yacht Club. At this
meeting It was decided to have the trial
races for the selection of the America's
cup defender against Shamrock III sailed
off Newport during the week of. July 27.
This modification of the original plan,
which extended the races over a period of
nearly two weeks, was due to the request
of the managers of the three big boats,
who wish to have plenty of time In case
of their selection, to prepare for the cup
races. '
The only accident reported on account of
the storm, was. that to the schooner Co
lumbia, which grounded for an hour or
two in the upper part of the harbor. She
was put off without damage.

Ali the witnesses agree on the manner
In which the man wore his clothes. His
light Lox overcoat was on his arm 'and
he acted as if he were about to call upon
some one on business. This overcoat was
on the man's body when it was found,
three of the buttons being fastened.
The only things about the man that
might indicate poverty were his proba
ble lack of money to buy a drink at Car
man's saloon and a week's growth of
beard. His poverty may have led him
to pick out West Berkeley as e good
place :n which to die. The pi3tol found
clenched in his hand was a new one and
this is indicative of the possibility of his
having purchased It purposely to com
mit suicide. The absence of any money

Mrs. Charlrs Wilson who heard two
shots ring ont In the neighborhood of
the barn Friday night and told her hus
band about It. had nothing more to add
to the mystery yesterday. She remem
bers now that It was between S and 9
o'clock that the firing was done, but
neither she nor her husband, to **hom she
remarked about it, made any Investiga
tion.
I Fawvhira comlnt down Fourth street while
I was tfoin* toward my home with my little
Klrl IIÂ»* came up to me and said. "Madam,
will you please irive me a drink of water?"
1 said "Yee." and toid myjittle Kirl to go
into the houÂ»e and get a slals. She rot the
Class, filled It and erave It to the man, and
after he had drunk It be went away. The
last I eaw of him he was goinj? toward the barn
where he met his death. This happened be
tween 1 and 2 o'clock.
I remember new that the man asked the way
to Eest Berkeley. As soon as he heard the
whistle he said: "That's 12 o'clock, isn't It?"
and when I eaid. "Yes." he raid. "Well, I'm
going to East Berkeley." and the last I saw of
him he was making toward University avenue.
When he came into my place he looked
around a bit and then said. "'I *ee you've got
your revenue license." I said. "Yea, I always
keep that in full view," and thÂ»n he said,
"That's good." From his general appearance
I thought he mast be a revenue officer, and an
I don't like to cross these kind of fellows I let
him look around my r>lace.
I think now the man wasn't a re\-enue
officer at all, though I thought I remembered
i-eeing him in the revenue office in San Fran-
Cisco when 1 went to get my license a week
or two aro. I believe he xralked in here and
simply tried to run a "bluff" to iret a drink.
But all I gave him was water. There are too
many of those kind of fellows around.
Mrs. Burcher, who saw the man last, re
members all the circumstances of his
visit to her place. She said:
BEQUESTS DIRECTION.
The man asked Hoessli the direction to
San Pablo and after being shown went off
in that direction. The next heard of him
is at Carman's saloon, where he was
obliged with a drink. And lastly he was
sotn bv Mrs. Annie Burcher of Fourth
and Harrison streets, who also granted
his request to be given a glass of water.
Regarding the visit of the unforunate,
Hoossli said:
The mp.n ramp into my place Friday morn
lnÂ»r and I snid him ecmethlne. I do not re
member now whether it was a package of
ciparettf-* or a cigar that h<* boujrht. He wore
gold -bowed glaFM-F and held a. brown overcoat
on hit arm. lie acted in no way disturbed. Be
fore he went he asked if there was a car line
to Ean Pab'o avenue. I directed him to the
tf-rmlrsus of the line at the corner of Univer
sity avenue and Phattuck avenue and told him
that he would likfly pc-t a car there at that
time, as t!vÂ» ha!f part 10 train wan Just cross
ing in to the Matinn. He went away in that
direction and I saw him no more until I viewed
his body at the Morgue. I have no doubt as
to the identitr of the man. I am positive that
it was the fame rxrson who was la my store
Friday morr.lng.
' Carman, the saloonman, said:
The man wandered into my place about II
o'clock and. afttr fretting a glass of water, re
mained until the noon whistle blew, when he
went off toward University avenue on San
Pablo avenue in a dtrc-ciion opposite to that

pretty well through people of whom he
askod ciuesticns. The person who seems
to have seen him first is C. R. Hoessli.
who keeps a cigar store at 2122 Shattuck
avenue. He saw him about 10:30 o'clock
Friday morning.
The investigators have succeeded in
racing tho man's movements In the town
a purpose in being In Berkeley. Of two or
three people he inquired the way to dif
ff>ront part? of the town.
No one believes that the fracture was
caused by the man's falling after he was
shot. lie was a heavy man, weighing
perhaps ISO pounds, but the doctor does
not think he could have fallen with force
enough to fracture his skull. Here is Dr.
Gladdir.g"s opinion of the case:
Although the evidence In the case is incom
plete, all that is obtainable certainly points to
e. cife ef murder. The fracture, on the head
extends from the right eye back to the ear and
down to the lower end of the ear. making a
half circle. It was. in my opinion, caused by
a blow en the forehead. That part of the ekull
Is dented In. but not fractured. The fracture
:Â¦â¢...-â¢. have occurred before the bone of the s-kull
was punctured by the bullet. In other words,
the man was hit with come weapon before he
was ehot.
If the blow was not enough to kill the fellow
either one of the shots would have rendered him
unconscious, so that the hand of a suicide never
couj <J have fired the second shot.
The condition of the pround around the body
shows that not much blood was *pllled there,
and as the man must have died at midnight, he
would have hall tLme. If he had been first killed
<>n the Fr-ct where he way found, to have bled
much more than the amount found on the grass
ar.->und the body.
Tho man wis lyir.g on his right arm when I
rolled him over, and the plEtol was held loorely
in the Index finger of the hand. This is not
â¢â¢vidence. however, that the hand of a euicide
had fln-d the ptatot, as it would have been only
I>ossible to have put the gun in the hand after
death.
There is no doubt that the man was hit very
hard on the head, and this before the fhots
were fired into his kull. There is little doubt
that this blow d!d not produce unconsciousness.
as the ft>su:e is larpe enough to permit a rapid
hemorrhage.
It ie my opinion that the fellow was foully
c>alt with.
One of the most inexplicable features in
the case is the manner in which the pistol
found in the man's hand was discharged.
The hammer cam* 1 down on one cartridge
and discharged it. then entirely skipped
the cartridge in the chamber next to It
and struck the next one and discharged
it. The pistol is in good working order,
and unless this was done by design It
would not have mi?sed a cartridge. Even
a person with all his faculties would not
have been able to turn the barrel without
some little trouble. This strange feature
in the case is one of the things that go to
bear out the murder theory.
All cf the movements of the man. as
tney wore noticed by people who remem
ber to have seen him on Friday, seem to
have been those of a rational being. He
talked nensibly and teemed to have had j
The fracture of the skull discovered by
Dr. Gladding: in making the autopsy Indi
cates that the man was struck with some
blunt instrument, probably these dub?.
This break la the skull was not noticed
until after the scalp had been laid back.
It was on the right side of the bead and
was wide er.ough for Dr. Gladding to put
the tip of his finger Into it. A piece of
tho skuli about an inch long was taken
from the head. There was no. abrasion of
the scalp on the right side of the head,
but one In the middle of the forehead
bcows where the blow was struck that
is supposed to have caused the fracture.
THEOBY OF FBACTTJBE.
C A. Carman, the San Pablo-avenus
FaJoon man. to whom the unkno\m dead
man applied on Friday for a glass of
water, has these weapons In his posses
sion and will turn them over to Coroner
Mtihrmar.a. He is firm In the belief now
that the raan was murdered by traisps.
though he was at first inclined to think
It a simple casp of pulcide.
"The ttndlns of these clubs." he said,
"convince me that the man was murdered.

thinks was the result of coming In con

A big crowd enjoyed the sport at Union
Coursing Park yesterday. The betting
was brisk and the hares all gave the
dogs unusually smart trials.
W. T. Raught's clever greyhound, Sll
verheels, carried off the honors and
showed herself to be a courser of the
first class. An Interesting feature of this
race was the fact that in the final trial
her opponent, TilHe R, came out of the
same litter as herself. â¢ ?
Palo Alto, who was favorite . 10 to 1,
was defeated by Sllverheels amid great
cheering from the grandstand.
. The very fast pup Fair Tralee led the
champion Palo, Alto a hot chase, but was
defeated by the older dpg. This la the
first defeat scored against this pup.
Among the spectators In the grandstand
was Miss BIJou Fernandez,,- leading' lady
in Miss Amelia Bingham's company, who,
with a party of friends, took a tremen
dous Interest In the proceedings. It was
the first time the young actress had been
In the coursing field and she was so much
pleased with the sport that Manager John
Ilalton Invited her to Inspect the grounds.
The stables, the starting box. where the
hounds are slipped . away and the hare
run were all given a close Inspection,
much to the edification and delight of the

a bit of coursing as could be wished. It
was a great finale, lasting no less than
two minutes and thirty-seven seconds.
After the two minutes a relief dog was
turned out and for the rest of the time
bunny gave the dogs a merry and excit
ing chase.
Toronto put up a true blue battle and

RUN8 AND HITS BY INNINGS.
Then both of Truck's . two-baggers
6cored runs. Both were tremendous
drives, far out to the left garden, and
would have been home runs on a largo
field. During the entire game Egan was
much In evidence and galloped round
short field like an antelope. The score:
San FrancUco â 1 Sacramento â
ond place. In the morning
they went to the ground by a 2 to 3 score,
and again in the afternoon struggle they
were put to rout after a gallant light
and a game finishâ score 7 to 5.
Fully 10,000 howling fans were at Rec
reation Park' when yesterday's game was
called, and mos=t of them were In one lit
of anxiety till the last man was called out
and the great battle came to a final close.
Baseball that 'was the real thing In every
re.Â«pect was handed out by the players,
and a harder fought game- was never
p'ayed at Recreation Park.
The i'core was tied twice In the first
three Innings. Then In the fourth the
Senators forged ahead by a run, the last
one they scored during the engagement.
The seventh was the gala round for the
home team. Then It was that they made
a mighty spurt and batted In a pair of
tallies which simply broke up the game.
Lfaby opened It all with a two-bagger
to center that set the crowd wild. Then
Llndsey, who had taken Pabst's place,
after the fourth, landed a short one to
center and scooted to second while they
were playing for Leahy. Cutter deliber
ately walked Krug, filling up the base?.
Then Kelly came up to the bat and the
fans began- to moan. "He hasn't got a
chance to hit It," yelled hundreds, but the
despised one, after swinging wildly at
two, smashed the ball over the first base
man's head and Leahy and Llndsey
scored. Krug tore around to third, and
he arrived with the last run of the game
on a long fly to right by Delmas.
Pabst was Injured In a mix-up at first
during the fourth Inning, so Kelly was
brought In from left field and stationed
at first, Llndsey being sent out to left.
Lynch was Buffering from a sore ankle
and did not play at all. Townsend, the
Senators' first baseman, Injured his ankle
while practicing before the game and he
was also compelled to sit on the bench.
"Truck" Egan furnished the sensation
of the day In the field and came near do
ing so with the bat. In the first Inning
LÂ«ahy was on the Initial bag and Krug
hit the ball out beyond second. It looked
like the surest kind of a safety, but Truck
whipped the ball over to Casey and
forced Leahy at second, making, a play
that Is seldom seen on any ball field.
MIKE FISHER was handed the
cruel package twice yesterday
and no longer Is the team
which floats his colors In sec-
(Pacific Coast league.)

There will be a meeting of the execu

Tennis Association this afternoon. The
annual election of officers will be held.
The following matches were played
Many good matches were played on the
California Club courts. Ray Cornell
caused quite a surprise by playing ties
with Norman Hodgkinson and W. S. Mac-
Gavin, the veteran.
In the morning Professor Joseph Daily,
the crack professional, played an exhibi
tion match with Sherwood Adams. Daily,
contrary to expectations, was In rare
form and beat his amateur opponent
handily. Daily's cut strokes were a reve
lation to the spectators. The score In his
favor was 6-3, 6-4.
In the third set Smith and Allen ran
the score up to 6-2 In their favor and
their opponents didn't appear to have a
chance. Whitney and Brady fought dea
perately and with the aid of a little luck
at the right time pulled the score up to
6-5 In their favor. Smith and Allen again
led at 7-6. With Smith serving the odds
appeared to be all in their favor, but he
started off with' a double fault and lost
the game. The next two games and match
went to Whitney and Brady. The score
was 6-3, 3-6, 9-7.
Whitney was easily the star of the four.
With the liberal handicap allowed his
team, he took many chances and drove
beautifully.
Smith and Allen were worried by the
handicap and played too safe a game.
Smith played a very weak game, his lob
bing and volleying being poor. Allen
played his usual good game. Brady did
not win many aces, but supported his
partner very well.
As was expected, the morning match
practically decided the tournament. In
the finals with Lytton and Gayness,
Whitney and Brady won with little diffi
culty. The losers received odds of "one
half of 15" and they were undoubtedly too
small. Brady proved to be about as skill
ful as either Gayness or Lytton, while
Whitney so outclassed his opponents as
to make the match one-sided. The score
was 6-1, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2.
The first set went to Whitney and
Brady. 6-3. In the second set Smith and
Allen played their balls lower and won,
6-3.
A large crowd of spectators was treat
ed to some exciting tennis on the park
courts yesterday. The tournament honors
were carried off by Jules F. Brady and
Robert N. Whitney, who beat Stewart
Gayness and Guy Lytton In the flnals.
By far the bÂ«st match of the touiia
ment was played in the morning, when
Whitney and Brady met Grant Smith and
Will Allen. The latter played from 15
back of scratch, while Whitney and
Brady received odds of "one-half of 15."

CORINTHIAN TACIIT CLUB AXXUAI*
HANDICAP RACE.
Brickell''and Bowes* sloop Genesta won
first prize In the annual handicap race of
the Corinthian Yacht Club yesterday, fin
ishing one minute ahead of the sloop
Ruby and three minutes and a half ahead
of the sloop Sea Fox. Twenty-four TachtÂ»
entered the race, each receiving a handi
cap based on her previous performances.
At noon the yachts anchored on an imag
inary line drawn from Wheelers Point,
Belvedere, to the Tlburon ferry slip, on
the outer edge of the bar. The regatta
committee started the yachts one at a
time, giving each Its handicap at the
start, m he whole fleet constituted one
class and the yacht finishing first toolc
first place the yacht finishing second won
second place, and so on. Each yacht
started at notice from the caramlttee.
and might sJId or welch anchor at the
option of Its skipper. The course was to
and round Blossom Rock buoy, leaving
the southeasterly spar buoy on the star
board hand: thence to and round Pre
sidio Shoals buoy, leaving the same on
the starboard hand; thence to and across
an Imaginary line drawn between twÂ«
stake boats anchored outside the bar on
the club house.
Few of the small yachts of the neei
started The little yawl Caprice sailed
out Into the channel, but found the seas
too heavy and did not complete the
course. The sloop Amlgo carried away
her bowsprit shrouds and retired from
the race. Espy carried off the Jaws of
the gaff just as she rounded Presidio
Shoal buoy, but completed the course.
The little sloop Elsie lost a man over
board and returned to pick him up, los
ing so much time that she was distanced.
Cupid and Edna made poor starts, not
being up at the line at the time at which
they were notified to cross It.
The sloop Harpoon, sailed by Fred
Cook, made the fastest timeâ 1 hour 47
minutes' 8 seconds â over the course,- and
received a special prize. Genesta, which
finished first, won a pair of marine
glasses. The following yachts also won
prizes In the order na*ned: Ruby. Sea
Fox, Mlgnon, Discovery. Hcrpoon, Phoe
nicia, Speedwell. Cupid, Emma, Neva.
Arcturus. Sans Soucl, Espy, Neptune and
Edna. The prizes consisted of coils of
rope, side lights, cr.ns of copper paint,
boxes of supplies and other articles.
In the channel the wind was strong and
the water somewhat rough for the small
craft. Genesta after rounding Blossom
Rock buoy, stood well over toward Al
catraz, as also did the sloops Ruby. Dis
covery, Sea Fox, Mlgnon, Josle. Harpoon
and some others. This course proved
more advantageous than that of making
short tacks close along the Presidio
shore.

KING CARLOS APPROVES
OF THE NEW CABINET
His abstemious habits are well known. He
has never given way to excess of any kind.
And his days have been long In the land and
his fight against death most glorious because
of his strong constitution, founded upon his
temperate, self-denying life.
His Industry should be copied. The' Im
mense volume of work which he was enabled
to accomplish, often laboring far Into the
night and uu before daybreak, testifies to his
marvelous genius for work. Ills loyalty to hla
church is worthy of our emulation and his real
piety may well be an example to us. Leo's
virtues are personal and his faults- are eccle
elastical.
Ths picture presented at the sick bed of the
illustrious "prisoner in the Vatican" la one
to excite our heartfelt pity. Lives of great
men teach us by both their successes and their
failures, by their virtue* and their faults.
I.*o's virtues are personal. Ills kindness to
those about him and his uniform gentleness
and tact with his inferiors are proverbial. If
we would have those to genuinely mourn our
death let us remember that "kind words can
never die" and that gentleness and sympathy
pay large dividends in friendships and at
tachments to make happy our lives.
The spirit of humanity of Leo is apparent In
all his writings â in his poems, essays and offi
cial paper*. Through all there breathes a
genuine love for his kind that ennobles him in
our eyes and makes his death a real loss to the
world.
Although in opposition to the faith of
which Pope Leo XIII is the supreme

Whistler's Death Came Unexpectedly.
LONDON, July 19.â It is ascertained
that the late James McNeill Whistler, the
eminent American artist, died under pe
culiarly distressing circumstances. He
had been ill for a year. His condition
had improved to such an extent that he
was ordered to go for a drive. As he
was about to leave his house in Chelsea
he was seized with a fit. He recovered
temporarily but was the victim of an
other paroxysm from which he died.
Three eminent London physicians were
summoned at the first attack, but they
were unable to afford any relief.
OAKLAND, July 19.â The recent pur
chase by the Santa Fe Company of the
Irregular piece of property extending from
the new pier of the Oakland, San Fran

the Judson Iron Works, and formerly
owned by the Judson Company, gives the
railroad company the right to fill in the
water front as far out as the Government
bulkhead, or in this instance nearly a
mile from the present shore line.
The tract of land purchased lies to the
west of the Southern Pacific tracks, and
is 390 feet east and west, and 275 feet on
one side by 150 feet on the other. The
Realty Syndicate will no doubt com
bine with the Santa Fe in making the
fill In order to create dockage facilities.
The roundhouse to be constructed at
the Emeryville terminus of the Santa Fe
will be as large as any on the Pacific
Coast, and will exceed In size that of the
Southern Pacific Company at West Oak
land. It will be constructed in the arc
of a circle of 165 feet radius, with stalls
70 feet deep. The turntable will be 73
feet in diameter. At the west of the

in Oakland, being prominently connected
with the Contra Costa Water Company.
The senior Beatles now reside in San

young, has made for himself an .enviable
position In the business world.
As soon as Mr. and Mrs. Beatie return
from their honeymoon trip they will make
their home in San Francisco, whence they
will send the formal announcement of
their marriage to the many friends they
had originally planned to invite as guests
to their wedding In October.
OAKLAND, July 19.â The many
friends of Miss Lena M. Nelson
and Clifford C. Beatie will read
with surprise the announement of
their marriage to-day in San
Francisco. Their engagement was an
nounced some months ago and the wed
ding was to have been an October event,
but the groom having recently accepted a
position with the Pacific Hardware and
Steel Company in San Francisco which
will necessitate an extended southern trip,
the young people decided to make it a
honeymoon tour and enjoy it tog'ether.
The ceremony took place in the parlors
of the Westminster Presbyterian Church,
the pastor. Rev. Hugh Gilchrist, of
ficiating. No one but the respective
parents of the bride and groom had been
taken into their confidence.
Both Mr. and Mrs. Beatie are well
known in Oakland, the bride, a tall and
very attractive blonde, being the daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. M. Nelson and being an
heiress in her own right to considerable
property. She is a most charming girl
and enjoys unusual popularity in the so

WASHINGTON, July 19.â Deputy United
States Marshals Charles E. Herron and
D. W. Dwyer of Alaska arrived here to

James C. Beasley of Nome, who Is being
taken back to Alaska. Beasley, together
with a Mr. Burns, had a contract to erect
a telegraph line for the United States In
Alaska. Beasley had charge of the busi
ness. The credit of the firm was consid
ered good, and when the checks purport
ing to be drawn by the firm were pre
sented for payment in San Francisco at
the army paymaster's office the signa
tures on two of them were found to be
forgeries. These checks were Indorsed, it
is asserted by Beasley for the firm of
Beasley & Burns. The Government has
decided to hold Beasley responsible for
the sum represented by the checks, which
foot up about $7000. Beasley was found by
the Marshals in South Africa, where he
had been for two years engaged In oper
ating in mines. When arrested he
promply expressed a desire to have the
matter cleared up to the satisfaction of
the Government.

The main points to which Smith takes
exception are Proctor's attack on the

On the first point Smith say* the law
provides for classified postofflces when

on the second point he states that tho

"Some time ago C L. Dagrett and a
Mr. Ovrrton, who hold a two-flfths inter
est in the Pacific Oyster Company, came
to us and made an offer for our oyster
beds. They said they wished to go more
deeply Into the cultivation of oy6ters.
They made us an offer, which we refused.
Then a few days ago the sloop, with the
ermed men on board, sailed In and took
possession. We were unable to get any
ratisfaction from the men. but we served
them with a written notice to leave, in
order to protect our rights. We were just
considering calling upon the Sheriff to
dispossess them as trespassers when we
received anotne-r call from Mr. Overton,
who egain made us an offer for the land.
"We are not going to stand any forcible
anft armed reizure of our property, and
this is a very remarkable proceeding in
this day."
"An effort has been made to Jump 1500
acres cf our property, and some one, sup
poeed to be the Pacific Oyster Company,
has got a sloop anchored over our oyster
bec> with guards on It.
"When the Legislature passed the oys
ter bed law* my father filed upon about
1500 acres, complied with the law and
planted it with oysters. We have held
undisputed possersion for years and we
deny any defect in the title.
Gova Roberts, the son o* Captain John
Roberts, said to-night:
BEADY TO FIGHT.
The people who have long held these
cyster beds are very much excited over
the condition of affairs and the presence
of the strange sloop In the waters of tne
bay.
When the oyster beds of this section
v.ere originally planted there was little
effort to make them a general commercial
proposition. Those who secured water
front lands under the laws which permit
ted the taking possession cf this kind of
property in consideration of the planting
cf ovrter beds were careless and did not
strictly comply with the law. It is now
raid that the men who have uent the
armed eloop to seize this property have
had a careful search made of the titles to
all of this property, and they have secured
enough evidence to show that they could
take possession of this land by force, and
have a very good chance to hold it tinder
the law. It is even eald that a company
has been Incorporated under the laws of
Nevada and that the seizure is being
made in the name of that company, bo
that litleation will be taken out of the
courts of Alameda County, where the
property is located # and thrown into the
Federal courts.
PURPOSE TO USE FORCE.
Some time ago efforts were made by E
L. Daggett and L. W. Smith of San Fran
cisco to secure control of some of the
oyster titles In this section. Agents of
these gentlemen vlElted the members of
Â¦what is known as the San I>andro Oyster
Company, composed of Socrates Huff A
fi. Gooch and T. W. Mulford. and wanted
to purchase their property. They refused
to sell, and it is now believed that the
*ame gentlemen who were anxious to
purchase at that time are determined to
pet Dossession of some of this valuable
property if they have to secure it through
f!aws in the local titles.
The property that the armed sloop has
teized lies just south of the claim of what
Is known as the San Leandro Oyster Com
pany, and a rough estimate of what has
been surveyed is that 2000 acres of tide
land has been taken up. Where the lines

certain, but they are said to include lands
DOW claimed by Captain Roberts of Rob
erts Landing, Henry Marlln, Mrs. G.
Marlin and others.
The mystery that surrounds the move
ments of the vessel and the men, the re
fusal to allow communication with those
on board and the warlike character of
the crew all goes to add to the general
excitement. The men have nothing to do
with the shore, and they are going about
their work in a very business like man
ner. That work has now extended over a
period of several days, arid has been
watched enough by the peop'e who hold
the original claims to these beds to in
form them that the str-;jrers are com
plying with the State lyster bed laws
governing the securing possession of this
character of property.

land? by some big corporation.
What the invader? are doing can only
be Judged from observation, for no com
munication is allowed with the vessel, but
there is a general opinion among those
who have held these oyster bed titles that
there is to be a wholesale Jumping of
these claims upon technical grounds of
pome kind, and this beliff is strengthened
by the knowledge of pome of these oyster
bed claimants that they have not strictly
compiled with the law which govern the
acquisition of these lands.
A sloop manned by armed men, with a
email run mounted on her deck, has been
anchored off San Lorenzo for several
days. In addition to the Armed men
there Â«re a number of surveyors and
oj-eter planters on board, and while the>
armed men keep the curious away, the
turveyors are engaged in running mys
terious lines, and the oyster planters are
at work filling the waters with seed oys

Where the mysterious sloop came from

people in this neighborhood, but the ob- |

Abandonment of paycar methods means
not only a considerable financial saving to
the railroad company, but removes all
danger of large robbery and heavy loss
in transportation of coin to the many
division pay points.
The murmurings went about further
because it was said that banks in San
Francisco, where the company has In
augurated the check payment scheme,
were enforcing a discount. About $200,000
to $250,000 a month is paid out in Alameda
County to railroad employes, the bulk of
the money being disbursed in Oakland.
With an eye to obviate just such com
plaints as have been started the Southern
Pacific Company has arranged that the
Oakland Bank of Savings shall be a local
depositary for the payment of all pay
checks without discount. W. W. Garth
waite, cashier of that bank, announces
that the corporation has made all plans
to handle the checks, and that easy
methods of identification have been fixed.
Members of families will be enabled to
cash the head of the household's checks,
and with little inconvenience.
Because of misunderstanding and lack
of Information many of the Southern Pa
fiiflc Company's employes at "West Oak
land, as well as in other parts of the
county, have been much perturbed over
the announcement that commencing this
month the company . will pay wages and
salaries by check instead of by coin from
a paycar, as has been the practice since
the company began business.
The men feared, and their fears were
well-grounded, that they^ would be com
pelled to discount their pay checks with
the merchants to cash them. Â«In West
Oakland shopkeepers whose trade Is
heavy among the railroad men had an
nounced that checks would be received,
subject to a discount of 25 cents up to
|50 and 50 cents above that amount.

, The 'success of this enterprise Is com
plete, according to the company's of
ficials, who to-day announced thejr con
fidence that the flow would continue un
interrupted now that the oil had run
through the entire line.
It was expected that the oil, which was
started in January from Bakersfleld,
would reach Point Richmond in sixty or
ninety days. As the days rolled into
weeks and then into months and no oil ap
peared at this terminal, .much apprehen
sion .was felt that the long pipe line, con
structed at a cost of $3,000,000, would prove
to be a failure. That fear, however, was
not expressed publicly by the oil company
people. In fact they declared their faith
in the work and said it would be only a
question of time when the fluid would
reach its destination.
Nevertheless the slow movement led the
officials to experiment with various
schemes to accelerate the movement of
the heavy combustible. Their last move
was/to establish heating plants along the
line. Now that the oil is running satis
factorily, those in charge say the auxil
iaries will be unnecessary and that the
twenty-eight relay pumping stations in
operation will be sufficient. They think
it will not be necessary to add to the sta
tions now working, although two more
may be installed.
The cause of the long delay is laid to
trouble in getting the oil started in the
new pipes. It is claimed by the officials
that once the fluid does flow Its
course will not be checked and that the
flow will be steadily maintained. They
say that some delay was expected, but it
was prolonged beyond the engineers' cal
culations.
Now that the line is in working order,
the company proposes immediate enlarge
ment of its refining plant at Point Rich
mond. Additions to the stills and re
torts will . be made and a large Increase
will be made in the force of men em
ployed. There are 700 men at pres
ent at the plant. Two large tank
barges are loading oil at the company's
wharf for foreign shipment.
The pipe line is 350 miles long, 2S0 miles
on the main run and seventy miles in
branches. On the main line the pumping
stations are ten miles apart.
POINT RICHMOND. July 19.â After
many weeks of delay and speculation, the
Standard Oil Company's pipe line, 280
miles long, between Bakersfleld and Point
Richmond, is in operation. Oil began
flowing into the refinery tanks here last
night at 9 o'clock and has been flowing
contlnuously/slnce then, with the excep
tion of a short time this afternoon,, at the
rate of 8000 barrels an hour.
Mr. Clayburgh left his home at 9 o'clock

to some suspicion. The Coroner's office

of the deputy coroners It was determined
after a careful examination of the body,
that death was due to an internal hem

ruing week, when Hall Calne's "Manx
man" will be produced in this city for the
first time, beginning July 26.
George \V. Hunter does a good turn as
a comedian and raconteur. He was greet
ed with applause and received a hearty
encore. Ethel Levy (Mrs. George M.
Cohn) Is, as she is advertised, a versatile
and vivacious singing and dancing come
dienne. Her songs were captivating and
her dancing graceful. The Three Polos
introduce new tricks In trapeze work.
Bailey and Madison commenced their
eecond week as eccentrics, and De Kolta
sustained his reputation as a wizard.
Hodges and Launchmere, in comedy and
the "cat" duet, are still an attractive fea
ture. The blograph; with many new pic
tures, closes the show.
Claude Gillingwater and his company
present a clever little comedy, "The
Wrong Man." Gillingwater takes the part
of "September Nightly." an author.
George Jones, a traveling broker, is
played by Reginand Barlow, Julia Jones,
the latter's wife, is sustained to the best
advantage by Miss Nina Lyn, and the lat
ter's sister. Miss May Lyn, assumes the
role of Polly, a maid. Edward McDonald
does Mulligan, the policeman. The piece
is full of wholesome comedy and each line
brings a laugh. There are no situations
revamped and what Is given to the audi
ence is original and clean cut.
The Orpheus Comedy Four produce a
whirlwind of fun. There is a farmer's
boy, an Irishman, a Dutchman and a
broken-down tragedian. Their quartet se
lections are excellent.
The Orpheum presents a bill this week
that has been seldom surpassed. Five
new numbers are on the programme and
each one of them affords much entertain
ment. New specialties are introduced In
the holdover acts.
Harold Crane's coster song, "I 'Aven't
Told 'Im," is booked for the popular lip,
and the Esmeralda sisters, with Arnold
Graxier. furnish some fetching dancing.
Raymond and Caverly work hard and oc
casionally "make good," their parodies,
however needing polishing.
To-night, naturally, the whole perform
ance will go more smoothly, except as to
the chorusâ which couldn't.
BLANCHE PART1XGTON.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Cheridah Simpson has some fair songs,
one, in which she is framed by a blue and
silver chorus, herself in the ever-fetching
tights, being particularly effective. The
chorus comes in here, and stays there. It
is worth twice the price of admission to
see the twinklinsr chorus feet in this
number. They are superbly drilled, beau
tifullyâundressed, and sing to the min
ute. Miss Simpson carries off -her role
with her usual handsomeness and insinu
ation but shared in the general tardiness.
Anna' Wilks roused an innocent enthusi
asm in a heart-to-heart rendering of
"Mollle Shannon."
Budd Ross went a long way to justify
his numerous admirers last night in a
tramp specialty that annexed the first
over the belt laugh of the performance.
Mr. Ross is young yet. and It shows. He
hasn't yet the air of that which has been
"it" for the many dear, dead days. He is
timid frequently, awkward in a taking
way, but the "stuff" is alL there. Budd
Rpss will arrivf. and soon. He numbers
the joke of the future among his advan
tages, has a versatile heel and will sing
better when he is less ashamed of it. As
a coming Nat Wills he is a quite promis
ing person.
The performance went slowly on the
part of the principals. Snap and vim
were largely wanting. Ginger was at a
liremlum and the waits between acts were
as long as on the Oakland 1 real. Then there
were Jokes of yesteryear, songs that ar
rived here before last night by many a
moon and* a rather generally lazy air
about things. Except as to the chorus.
And Budd Ross.
With the help of a "ticker" for local
color, the Rcgers Brothers are' now to be
found "In Wall Street" at the Giand
Opera-house. They arrived last night to a
house and a half that showed itâthem
selvesâ manifestly friendly. For those to
whom the gorgeous fluff and glitter of
tuese productions are not a whole show,
some forbearance was needed.

Fire broke out yesterday afternoon In
a Chinese lodging-house In Sullivan alley
in the rear of 718 Jackson street. It was
caused by one of the female inmates al
lowing the flame from a gas burner to
ignite some mosquito netting In her bed
room. The inmates were quickly removed
and an alarm turned In from box 25. The
firemen soon extinguished the blaze. The
fire caused considerable excitement
among the Chinese in Sullivan and Cum
Cook alleys. The loss will amount to
about $1000, half of It being caused by
water damaging the stock In a store un
der the lodging-house.

visited California last year and devoted
considerable time to seeing the wonder
ful sights of the State, especially the
magnificent scenery of the Yosemite Val
ley, which they thoroughly traversed. In
speaking of his previous trip yesterday
t.je Governor referred to the visit to the
Yosemite "aa one of the most enjoyable of
his life. While there he and his friends
were photographed among the giant red
woods and negatives of these photographs
have since been enlarged to an enormous
size and . are now bemg used by the
Southern Pacific Company to advertise
that feature of California scenic effects.
' General Greene, since he returned from
the : Philippines and retired from the vol
unteer.army, has paid San Francisco but
one visit,; but .his absence has not caused
him to be forgotten here, for, as a mem
ber of the'New York Police Commission,
he has been attracting widespread atten
tion by his rigid enforcement of the rules
of the department. ' As Roosevelt did be
fore him. General- Greene has gone in for
many /reforms In the different police dis
tricts of the great metropolis and as a
result of his strict discipline among the
members. of the force he has caused fre
quent sensations' by bringing men before
the baf of . the . commission on various
charges of a serious character, shifting
'Captains and subordinate officers from
their districts and in a general way creat
ing a reign of fear among those, members
of. the department who, through fancied
political pulls, have' regarded' themselves
free to perform their duties in a manner
that would best serve their own interests
or those of their political friends.

TERDAY IN A PRIVATE CAR. . - .
Immediately after their arrival here
yesterday the party visited the Ocean
BENJAMIN B. ODELL JR.. Gov
ernor of the State of New York,
and party, composed of General
Francis V. Greene, retired, -now
a member of the Police Commis-.
sion of New York; T. E. Ellsworth of
Niagara County, former leader. of the
New York Senate: Dr. S. B. Ward and
his son, D. B. Ward: F. Clark. and the
Governor's sons, Bryant and H. R. Odell,
arrived in this city yesterday morning
and are registered at the Palace Hotel.
The Governor and his friends have been
making a tour of the Northwest, with the
special view of enjoying the scenic points
of "Washington and Oregon and the main
purpose of coming this far south is to
give the sons of the Governor and their
college chum. Clark, an opportunity to
see San Francisco.
Not the least attractive feature of the
exercises were the soncs rendered by a
Hawaiian quartet. Their melodious na
tive ditties brought round after round of
applause. ; .^<-
The Rev. Dr. Smith Baker of Portland,
Me., once the pastor of the famous Wil
liston Church, where the Epworth League
had its inception, was next introduced.
Besides his stirring words, a remarkable
likeneps to the martyr President McKin
ley kept all eyes intent upon his face. He
said in part:
The Epworth I>ague and the Young lien's
Christian Association are, to my mind, the two
most powerful evangelical organs in the his
tory of this century. They go hand in hand
to accomplish the work which we are put
upon this earth to do â to win souls to God.
Never thUWc that your influence can be too
email to do the work which the Lord would
have you dc. Be a bank president, a humble
clerk In a store or a bootblack, any man can
become the instrument of the Almighty if
the great will ordains such. Go on with your
good work, support the hands of your young
men who are laboring In foreign lands; make
the next fifty years as replete with good works
as were the last.
With a mass meeting in the auditorium,
which was attended by enthusiastic
Christians from all of the churches, of the
city, the four days' jubilee service of the
Young Menu's Christian Association came
to a close yesterday. As the past days
of the celebration have been devoted to
a retrospective view of the work which
ha? be^n done in the fifty years gone by,
so the thought of yesterday's services was
one of appropriate anticipation of the
larger and broader scope of the work of
the powerful Christian organization
which lies beyond the seas.
Throughout the forceful words cf all
the speakers and In the hearty singing of
missionary hymns there was manifested
a determination to carry the wrk of re
claiming young men to God's kingdom to
distant lands, where the benighted still
live in their ignorance. As a pledge of
the determination of the workers? to turn
their faces to the Kar East in the fifty
years to come, the services closed with
the collection of. a goodly sum, which is
to be forwarded to Galen Fisher, general
secretary of the association in Japan.
After the singing of the old song, "Gath
ering in the Sheaves," Superintendent H.
J. McCoy gave a passionate appeal for
the continuance of the noble efforts
which have characterized the association
in the past and made a plea for the rec
ognition of the work which was being
done by the association men in Japan,
India and Africa. He was followed by
William Cleaver, superintendent of the
Los Angeles branch of tne Y. M. C. A.,
who added a strong word to the sentiment
of the meeting.
Dr. H. H. Bell of the First United Pres
byterian Church then spoke. His words
in part were as follows:
The events in the Young Men's Christian As
fsociation in the world at large as well as
in our city for the past fifty years should
command a silence eloquent with meditation
uron God's great work. His hand is . to be
seen in our work everywhere. A significant
fact is that the people of God's church are
the most mighty of all the peoples on earth.
Of this mighty people I feel that no army
which Is working for the spread of the gospel
and the training of Christians has any more
steadfastness of purpose and mighty energy
than the Y. M. C. A.
Meanwhile the police had Mr. Denefield
comfortably booked on a charge of as
sault with a deadly weapon. When they
called at the hospital to take Mr. Scott
into custody explanations were in order.
But mere were none, and that is why
Chief Martin chewed six cigars to wisps
through sheer nervousness.
"When they returned to the bedside of
the wounded colored gentleman nothing
of him remained but his trousers.
Mr. Joseph Scott, from West Berkeley,
Â¦was the trouserless cause of all the
trouble. With infinite cunning he had
clipped from his cot in the Receiving Hos
pital and disappeared as completely as if
be had gone to Oakland. The determined
search of the bluecoats availed nothing.
Mr. Scott and Mr. Robert C. Denefleld,
alto of a dark tone, had a little difference

on the corner of Broadway and Kearny
street. Mr. Denefield emphasized his ar
rument by slipping a penknife into Mr.
Scott's right thigh and thereby necessi
tated the latter's taklnjr a drive to the
Emergency Hospital.
Not long had the wounded Mr. Scott
been there when a mysterious frjend
called and demanded to see him. He was
refused and tiie attendants turned their
attention to a new case.
All of the kecr.-eyed Fleuths of the Po
lice Department were on the qul vlve last
night, searching every hidden cranny of
the city's byways with bullseyes and go
ing over the Barbary Coast with a fine
tooth comb. A double watch was set on
the ferry building and all outgoing trains
were inspected with the most vigorous
Furvelllance. Chief cf Detectives Martin,
pitting in his office answering call bells
from Ingleside to the Fishermen's wharf,
chewed six cigars to wisps through sheer
nervousness.
It was a colored gentleman, six feet
high, minus his nether garments, against
whom the concentrated energy of the po
