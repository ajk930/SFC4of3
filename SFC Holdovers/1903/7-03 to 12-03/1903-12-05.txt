INQUEST IN SUICIDE CASE
REVEALS STRANGE LETTER
The Curritutcut' life-saving station
reports the Moccasin in good condi
tion without, any water" in her. From
reports received, however, it is not
thought any headway may be made
toward a floating of the vessel without
the aid of wreckers, as she is high ami
dry ui)on the beach at%low water and
directly in a nasty surf at high tide.
The Adder is leaking and her ma
chinery is badly damaged. Lieutenant
English, commanding the Peoria, says
the little boats towed very well. indee'J,
until they were just off the Virginia
capes. There the heavy seas running
at that time proved too .much for the
ropes of* the Adder, which was Rowing
first, following the tug. They snapped
short and two submarine vessels went
adrift. The Peoria sought to catch
them, but they drifted southward be
fore the wind rapidly. There were only
the broken bits on which to get a hold,
so the tug could only run in between
them and keep them from bumping to
gether.
The seas were running entirely* too
high, the lieutenant said, for the mg
to run alongside the boats, and it
would have been suicidal to have low
ered a boat. All the Peoria could do,
therefore, was' to keep the boats apart.
All Wednesday this continued and thtn
the line between the boats snapped.
It was then that Boatswain Deery,
who comes from the Brooklyn, per
formed his heroic act in. a last at
tempt to save the boats.
Great confusion was caused by the
conflicting reports regarding the where
abouts of the Peoria, Adder and Yank
ton. The navy yard was without in
formation whatever and the Weather
Bureau reported the tug and the Adder
going direct to Annapolis. In navnl
circles thfse circumstances, together
with the inability of life savers to enter
the stranded vessel, caused some un
easiness, especially over the condition
of the Moccasin. Â¦
NORFOLK, Va., Dec. 4.â The naval
tug Peoria, towing the submarine tor
pedo-boat Adder, has arrived at the
navy yard here. The Adder was saved
by the heroism of Boatswain Deery,
who responded to a call for volunteers
and swam 400 yards with a line to the
Adder from the tug and pulled a haw
ser after him. The Adder is leaking
badly. The Peoria left to-night for
Curriticut to aid the Yankton and Vix
en in floating the Moccasin, which is
now high and dry upon the beach.
When the boatswain, Deery, respond
ed to the call for a volunteer to swim
to the Adder, a thirty-mile gale with
mountainous seas was sweeping over
the Peoria and breaking the drifting
submarine boat beneath tons of water.
Deery with a slender line fastened
around his waist battled with wind and
tide for 400 yards, finally reaching the
Adder and gaining her deck. There he
hauled a thick hawser aboard ; by
means of the life line and made it fast.
Â¦At the time the Adder was. being
t tossed about like a cork one minute and
driven far. beneath" the surface "the
next, reeling and wallowing in such. a
manner as to make it almost impossible
to retain a footing upon her scanty
decking, but Deery held on until he.
had finished his work. Then he went
back to the tug hand-over-hand on the
hawser.
It was said at the navy yard to-day
that Boatswain Deery would be com
mended at once to the President for
bravery. > . . -
After Senator Hanna left the White
House he was besieged by newspaper
men who desired to learn the result of;
the conference. ' He declined to make
any statement, insisting that it was
merely a friendly talk over matters of
mutual interest and/ was of no public
significance or importance. "I spent a
'very pleasant evening," he admitted
finally.
"That is about all there is to it. You
can say, however, that all stories about
wide differences between the President
and myself are absurd. I have no
statement to make." /
Likewise it can be said no discussion
took place concerning the changes of
the Republican National Committee.
President Roosevelt has expressed to
Mr. Hanna his desire that he shall re
tain the chairmanship. . The Senator
has not announced his feelings regard
ing the matter. It may be said that the
state of Mn.Hanna's health is involved
in the decision, and, indeed, will be the
controlling factor in it.
The conference took Â¦$. _wide ' range.
It dealt principaHjr-\vl'&'"pendinÂ£ and
prospective legislation before Congress,
particularly .with' that relating to the
isthmian canal and with the general
present conditions. Before and since
he became - chairman of the Inter
oceanic Committee - of the Senate, Mr.
Hanna has manifested deep interest
In all questions relating to that water
way. He took occasion to-night to
discuss the present situation,, espe
cially its diplomatic phases, very fully
with the President. The agreement
on the subject was absolute. Both, it
can be said, are confident the position
taken by the administration will be
approved by the American people.
\The contested confirmation of Gen
eral Wood was not considered, though
an incidental reference to it was
made. It is known that the Presi
dent and Senator Hanna differ on that
subject, but each fully recognizes that
the difference is honest and sincere,
and it is believed by friends of both
that it cannot possibly interrupt their
relations.
WASHINGTON, Dec." 4.â An import
ant conference was held at the White.
House to-night between the President
and Senator Hanna. It occurred on the
initiative of Senator Hanna and' to both
participants the conference was per
fectly satisfactory.
Senator Hanna arrived at 9:30 and
remained with the President until 11
o'clock. The conclusion was marked by*
evidence of sincere frinedship on both
sides. Neither the President nor Senator
Hanna cared to discuss for publication
the details. It was stated that the
meeting had no difference in any per
sonal respect from others that they
have had in the past and which they
will have in the "future.
It was announced^ that reports re
cently circulated that there had been
or was likely to be unpleasant relations
between. the President and the Senator
amounted to an absurdity. The Presi
dent himself wants it to be understood
that he will not take occasion to dig
nify any of them with attention. It
may be said that the relations between
the two -are cordial and appreciative
friendship. --. - ; Â¦ -.;-Â¦'

expenditures for the fiscal year 1903
were (82,618,034. By reasonable approx

"I venture, however, to expres the
hope that Congress may give to the

It is recommended by the Secretary
that for the better government of per
sons BUbject to the laws and discipline
of the navy the President, whenever
he EhaU deem such power necessary,
may authorize commandants at remote
naval stations .to convene general
courts-martial: that some simple sys
tem of civil government be provided
for the islands of Guam and Tutuila,
with appeal In proper cases to courts
of the United States, and that like pro
vision be made for the satisfactory
government on the civil side of the
naval stations at Guantanamo, within
v.-hich concession It Is understood a
considerable number of persons, -citi
zens of Cuba and others, will remain as
permanent or temporary residents, it
Is suggested that this station and the
Midway Islands might appropriately
for certain purposes be attached to
judicial districts of the United States
in substantially the manner adopted in
the case of guano islands.
Relative to the usefulness of the
navy the Sacretary says:
"The expenditures for the support of
the navy have Increased considerably,
were during the last fiscal year larger
than In any year of our history except
the years 1864 and 1SC5, and are certain
to increase still further. It is Interest
ing to compare the expenditures of the
present with those of the past, though
no standard of comparison exists which
is In all respects, satisfactory. As a
nation we are able to possess a navy
of such Eize and cost as our national
Interests and duties require. On' the
other hand we should not be tempted
by the abundance of revenue to Jn-

"Thirdâ The creation of a general
Ftaff. which shall be responsible for the
efficiency of the vessels afloat and the
personnel of the navy, collect and di

plans for nctive operations may be
formulated, and act as the military ad
viser of the Secretary, having no au
thority except such as may be con

secretary. It should be understood that
the department does not entirely !uok
the assistance which would be rendered
by a general staff. The war college at
Coaster Harbor Island, the intelligence
office, the board of inspection and sur
vey and the bureau of navigation work

general board, which was created by
my predecessor as the result of experi
ence in the war with Spain.
"The admiral of the navy, vÂ» hose ex
perience and advice, always fully avail
able, have been of inestimable value,
is the president of this board and the
chief of the bureau of navigation is- the
chairman of its executive committee.
Through th?se two officers the deliber
ations and opinions of the board, based
not only upon their experience as of
ficers, but on the work of the bodies
above enumerated, are brought to the
attention of the Secretary. Together
the admiral of the navy and the chief
of the bureau of navigation are in a
considerable measure performing the
duties of a chief of general staff. The
board has no existence except by Vir
tue of tha departmental regulation,
which may at any moment be modified
or repealed. It is not my purpose to
recommend specifically at this time any
of these proposals, but only to bring
them forward for the earnest discus

and without the naval service, that al

Mrs. Reeves is also in receipt of a
personal testimonial from her pupils,
which, however, will not be presented
to the board, as it is a personal com
munication. It follows:
Mrs. I. D. Reevesâ Kind ' Friend and
Teacher: We, the members of your classes of
the Polytechnic High School, tender you this
expression of the gratitude and love we bear
you. Accept our feeble recognition of your
efforts and sacrifices in our behalf in your ca
pacity as teacher. We feel that we are in
debted to you and that we are therefore com
pelled to acknowledge our appreciation Of
your untiring kindness and of your valuable
and encouraging aid in our scholastic labors. .
You have so harmoniously blended the func
tions of the teacher with those of the friend
that you have made study a pleasure. You
ha\c always shown youruelf the friend of
the industrious and deserving' pupil; ever
ready to encourage by your kind words. ' thus
Riving new hope and dispelling all gloomy fore
bodings, pointing an easy and effective way to
overcome all difficulties and remove all ob-
Ftacles. We will ever try to be mindful of
the many valuable , precepts > that . you ; have
often expounded to us as rules of conduct and
we will in all our undertakings endeavor - to
act on the Impulse that will prove the sin
cerity of. our principles.
The undersigned consider Mrs. Reeves as a
most successful teacher taking a deep interest
In the advancement and progress of her pupils,
anl as- to her success our report cards are
the best evidence.
Tho undersigned, your petitioner*, being pu
pils of Mrs. Irene D. Reeves, teacher of Eng
lish and history in the Polytechnic High School,
respectfully petition that your honorable body
will restore Mra. Reeves to her position in
said school from the unasslgned lift of teach
ers.
Attorney Stephen V. Costello, on be
half of Mrs. Irene D. Reeves, who was
consolidated out of her position in the
Polytechnic High School, will present
a petition to the Board of Education
to-day asking that Mrs. Reeves be re
instated to her place. The petition is
signed by some fifty pupils, all of
whom testify to the ability of Mrs.
Reeves. The petition follows:

Commenting editorially on this
phenomenal growth, the Times says:
' "It Is safe to say that no other town
in the West of equal population has
shown so great an increase In build
ing. It follows that the access of
population has been proportionate. It
has been conservatively estimated that
the population of San Mateo to-day is
not less than 3000, as against 1832 in
1900. Thepresent year's growth has
been largely in excess of the two years
preceding, and everything indicates
that it will be! much larger next year.
"There have been many other im
provements In addition to., those
named. During the year the exten
sion of the; United Railroads' electric
line was completed In double track to
this city, representing an 'outlay of
about $1,000,000 from here to the^San
Francisco line. The Southern" Pacific
has made ..improvements to its lines in
bridges,' culverts, double': tracks,
straightening, leveling, etc.', . which for
the .entire county aggregate' about
$300,000. The United Gas and Elec
tric Company has 'expended about
$ 3 5, 0 0 0 2 in new .generator, engines,
boiler and power Â¦ extension. A new
girls' college : has been erected and a
High School i purchased.
* "The transactions in real estate have
been enormous. , Â¦ Exact figures arÂ© riot

Government, a salmon fisheries con
gress will be convened in Seattle, Feb

be large and every man attending the

establishments from San Francisco to

"Stealthily drawing one of my
revolvers from beneath my pil
low I took deliberate aim at the
intruding figure and fired. Hur
riedly rising and summoning a guard I
discovered lying across ray window
ledge the dead form of a stalwart man.
which I readily recognized as that of
a paroled Boer, who had evidently been
delegated by the plotters to murder me
and avenge the death of Cordau.
"The midnight shooting apparently
caused the plotters to abandon any fur
ther plans'they may have had to assas
sinate British officers, for no further
trouble was had."
The major has been traveling through
the Southern States, visiting former
South African friends, and he says his
trip to California is for a similar pur
pose.
â¢RTT.T^t A P3J0TTEB.
"In the afternoon of the day of the
execution I received a visit from a
young Boer woman, who claimed to be
Cordua's intended wife, and appealed
for permission to see him. She had not
been advised that Cordua had paid the
penalty for violating his parole and the
news of his death that morning com
pletely prostrated the unhappy woman.
"The same evening the officers of the
barracks were told of another plot to
assassinate me. I was quietly warned
to be on my guard. Several nights later
I was aroused from my slumbers by a
strange noise and detected some one
slowly raisins: a window near my bed
and a few seconds later the head and
shoulders of a man protruded into the
room.
"The execution was the first to take
place In South Africa under military*
law and the case was complicated for
me by reason of the fact that I had
had charge of the German lieutenant
for eleven days, during which he had
come to recard me as a friend. The
day preceding the execution, shortly
after Cordua had been informed thai,
there was no longer any hope for clem
ency, he requested permission to write
a letter, which was granted.
"The following morning the prisoner
faced a firing squad of ten men. Of
the ten shots fired seven pierced Cor
dua's heart.
FIRST EXECUTION.
"Lieutenant Cordua was captured
with a number of Boer soldiers, but
later released on parole. Barely had ho
gained his liberty before he was en
gaged in a plot to assassinate me and
the spiriting away of General Lord
Roberts. The British, however, were
warned of the plans of the German and
his co-consplrators and a trap set .for
the latter led to the recapture of Cor
dua. disguised in a British uniform.
"After a trial by court-martial that
extended over a long period, the lieu
tenant was sentenced to be shot and
I was ordered by General Maxwell to
execute the death sentence.
It was this Major Barchard. under
whose direction the execution of Lieu
tenant Hans Cordua of the German ar
my, serving with the Boer forces, took
place, and it was the incident that
came near resulting in the major's as
sassination a few nights later. Regard
ing this episode of the war the major
said yesterday:
Major Carl Barchard of Devon, Eng
land, an officer of the West York Reg
iment which took an active part In the
Boer war and who personally figured
conspicuously in one cf the rather ro
mantic Incidents of the South African
unpleasantness, is a guest at the Pal
ace, having arrived from the South yes
terday.
Whether Mrs. Coit will be able to appear in
court next Mcndsy depends on what her doc
tor will say. As to the statement that if she
does not go to court the examination of Gar-
Dett and witnesses will be held in her apart
mrnta. I presume that every official connected
with the case will behave in a gentltmanly
tnenner end not ruthlessly intrude into a lady's
*rartments.
District Attorney Byington said last
evening that no exception would be
made in the case of Mrs. Coit, but that
the law would take its course.
"Mrs. Coit is the principal witness
In this case," said Byington. "and her
evidence must be given. If she can
not come to court it is for the Judge
to decide whether her testimony shall
be taken in her rooms. No one has
any right to hint that Mrs. Colt is
likely to be treated without dignity by
any official connected with this case.
Her rights will be respected, but she
Â¦will be treated the same as any other
witness and the law must take its
course."
The case of Alexander Garnett on
the charge of murder will be called
before Police Judge Fritz at 11:30 next
Monday morning.
On behalf of Mr* Coit I can state that ehe
is not contributing any money to the defense
c-T Alexander GsTiett. Rumor had it that
Mrs. Coit was willlnc to expend $10,000 in his
behalf. I asked her about the rumor and her
reply, to nÂ»Â« was "not a dime."
"I am not able to leave my bed at
present," said Mr?. Coit to Ryan, "but
if I am able to do so on Monday I will
be in the courtroom as desired."
Detective Ryan, accompanied by At
torney Creswell and Dr. de Vecchi,
then left Mrs. Coit's apartment. Dis
trict Attorney Byington arrived at the
hotel immediately after Ryan had
served the subpena.
Attorney Creswell, at the request of
Mrs. Coit, made the following state
ment after the subpena had been
served:
There never has been the slightest intention
on the Dart of Mrs. Colt to evade service of
the eubpena. She has been ill since the shoot
ing cf Major McClune. After Mrs. Coit gave
ftf-r testimony to. Coroner Iceland last Monday
ehe was unable to e!e*p or eat for two days.
Yesterday when It waÂ« stated that an officer
Â¦was to serve a pubi>ena on Mra. Coit, Dr. de
Vecchi said it would, be torture for her to po
through the ordeal. I ttl^hooed to Captain
cf Detectives Martin and told him what Dr.
<2* Vecchi had *tatÂ«"d. It was then agreed
that the eubDena should be served to-day.
â¢While Dr d* Vecchi did not forbid the serv
:Â¦ r of the eubptna. he said that he would
rather not have It Cone, but Mra. Coit herself
requested that thÂ» officer be allowed to enter
her rooms and do his duty.
Mrs. Lillian Hitchcock-Coit^ was
served with a subpena last evening in
her rooms at the Palace Hotel. The
document commands her presence in
the court of Police Judge Fritz next
Monday morning to testify in the mur
der case against Alexander Garnett,
charged with feloniously killing Major
J. W. McClung.
Detective T. L. Ryan arrived at the
Palace Hotel at 5 p. m., prepared to
eerve the subpena on Mrs. Coit. and
tvas met by Attorney H. Creswell and
Dr. de Vecchi.
Attorney Creswell took Detective
Ryan into Mrs. Coit's room.
Mrs. Colt raised herself from the
bed and listened to the reading of
the subpena by Detective Ryan and
accepted the copy of the document
tendered by the officer.

many spangled creations greatly en
hanced the beauty of the wearers.-
Miss Jennie Blair wore a beautiful

HANDSOME GOWNS.
Greenway always insists upon good
music at his dances, and this has al
ways been one of the secrets of' the
success that has attended his affairs.
The music last evening had the
charm of being bright and snappy.
Among the most fetching of the new
selections were: "Girls of Baden"
waltz, "Wedding of the Winds" waltz,
"Laughing Waters" deux temps, and
numbers from "The Prince of Pil^en."
Supper was served at midnight in the
maple and marble rooms. The only
embellishments to the small round ta
bles were golden candelabra, surmount
ed by red and yellow shades. Dancing
was resumed after supper and it
3 o'clock before the delightful event
came to a close.
This is now the twenty-second sea
son of the dances of this set. They
were started by Ned Sheldon and were
called the Friday night assemblies.
Greenway took "up the leadership where
his predecessor left it off and has
maintained the same style that always
made the dances the most popular of
the season.
â¢ The Greenway assembly, given last
evening In the new ballroom of the
Palace Hotel, was a brilliant affair,
marked by unusual enjoyment. The
appointments were characterized by
the greatest simplicity.
In the ballroom palms and ferns were
simply arranged at one end to screen
the orchestra. This was the only dec
oration, save for baskets of woodwar
dia fÂ«Â»rns and clusters of huckleberry
branches, arranged in the conserva
tory. It was the smiling faces of the
guests and the shimmering gowns
and flashing jewels of fair women that
gave the brightness to the scene.
All the available rooms on the first
floor Adjoining the ballroom were util
ized for the occasion. These included
the Empire, Conservatory and Louis
Quatorze rooms, which were arranged
so the guests could sit and chat be
tween dances and enjoy the delights of
champagne punch and ices.
The guests were very late in arriv
ing and the ball was not at its height
until just before midnight.
Fully 200 guests lent their presence to
the scene. There was no cotillon, as
Mr. Greenwaj' preferred a straight pro
gramme of informal dances, the cotillon
being arranged for the Christmas ball,
which will take place on the 18th of the
present month.

Associated Students. Thelen has won
all the honors the university has to
bestow upon its debaters, having car
ried off the Carnot debating medal and
been a member of two intercollegiate
debating teams against Stanford.
Thelen's competitors were Hjalmar J.
Loken, '04; Leo D. Bishop, '05; Irving
Metzler, '04, and Robert L. AlcWllllams,
'04. The subject under discussion was
Admiral Stephen Decatur's famous
toast, "Our country in her intercourse
with foreign nations â may she e\er be
rightâ but right or wrong; our coun
try." Each of the debaters reviewed
the sentiment from its ethical aspect.
The speakers each devoted fifteen
minutes to the theme and at the con
clusion the judges retired to deliberate.
There were nine judges, being the fol
lowing named: Professors Frederick
Slate, George H. Howison, William
Carey Jones, Cornelius B. Bradley,
Alexis F. Lange, Mayor Warren Olney
of 'Oakland, James K. Moffltt, Harris

Anna Ross left the courtroom yester
day after hearing the verdict of the
Jury without evidencing the impression
it made upon her. She sat through th^
final scene as she sat throughout the
trial, and when it was over walked
away without a sign of emotion.
This morning she was moved to a
cell other than the one she has been
occupying. Her passion then burst
forth in all its fury. A special watch
ha Â«â¢ been placed over her to see that
she does herself no harm. She comes
up for formal sentence a week frorn to
day. The jury, however, fixed her pen
alty at life imprisonment.
Condemned to spend the rest of her
life In San Quentin. Anna Ross has
lost her nerve and is acting like an in
sane creature in the County Jail. At
times she screams at the top of her
voice. She has refused to eat her food
and has hurled the dishes at the woman
who carries it to her.

Manager Decoto thinks, however,
the chances for arranging a game
with Minnesota are good, private ad
vices having come to him that there
will be no obstacle in the way of this
team making the western trip. The
Michigan eleven is a much better one
than Minnesota's and California would
prefer to play it, but California will
take what it can get.
The "California second eleven will
play a game against the Selma team,
the winner of .what is known as the
Valley League, if the arrangements
for the midwinter game fall through.
The eleven haÂ» already elected R. W.
Kittrelle captain for this trip. The
players are Coogan, W. H. Howard,
Read, Taylor, Gray, Elliott, Henry,
Geary, Risley, Kittrelle, Boynton,
Burns, Stines, Hill and Dauser. The
date for this game will not be set
pending the outcome of the negotia
tions for the midwinter game.
With Michigan out of it and the
Â¦Carlisle Indians too, through having
agreed to play the Perris Indians at
'"Riverside on New Year's day, Califor
nia's only remaining chance for the
midwinter game is with the Univer
sity of Minnesota. The Columbia
University made overtures to Califor
nia to play, but the executive com
mittee of the Associated Students.de
cided a would be too expensive to
bring that team across the continent,
so its offer was turned down.
BERKELEY. Dec. 4. â Graduate
Manager Ezra Decoto of the Univer
sHy of California received a dispatch
from the captain of the University of
MicUigan football eleven to-day say
ing it would be impospible for the
team to play California on New Year's
day. The reason given for this ad
verse answer to California's challenge
is that the board of control of the
Michigan University refused to permit
the eleven to come to the coast.
With Michigan and Carlisle Indians
Out of It This Game Seems
Possible.

this morning- at the First Presbyterian

that the disoiples of ithe "present day

Dr. Work said in part: ;* . J " â¢ '
"It seems very 'evident from the Old
Testament that the Jews' had touch
ed the surrounding peoples with their
religious beliefs, and that this contact
had its effect. The views of the proph
ets were singularly broad, for they,
said that trie 'glory of God should fill
the whole earth.' "Â¦ *
In his paper on "The Message of the
Gospels" Professor C. S. Nash of Berke
ley' said: â¢
."Jesus was a cosmopolitan. God sent
him not to a nation 'but through a na
tion to mankind. Jesus said: 'As my
Father sent me, so I send you.. Go ye
into all the world and preach the Gos
pel unto every, nation.' With these
words in our ears, can any true Chris
tian be other than. a missionary?"

The Rev. , A. S. Sawyer; in his ad
dress on "The Needs of American Cit
.ies.'V'compared the city to the heart.
He said, in speaking of the need of
evangelical r work in the cities: "When
a man is sick the physician first exam
ines his heart, and if the heart be sound
he extends his examination to' other
parts of the body. So it is with our
American cities. The country sup
plies the city with its worst as well
as its best blood, 'arid it should be the
endeavor of every Christian to see that
the good is not contaminated by the
bad." - â¢;v.i^:
The Rev. Ng*Poon Chew of San Fran
cisco discussed the "Needs of China."
He said that a few years ago China
would, have resented the inference that
she needed anything, but he added:
"China is waking up to the fact that
she needs â¢ a great many things, al
though there is at present a great dif
ference of opinion as to what they are.
Some say, 'Give jus a greaj, army and
navy," others 'Give our young men an
education in art and science,' and still
others ! say. 'Let', us welcome modern
civilization.' None of these, however,
will answer. The need of China Is, a
spiritual one, and only when the nation
embraces Christianity will . the great
question be answered."
Church fairs and teas were not en
couraged by the Rev. E. E. Baker in
his address on "Money and Missions."
He said: ' J:"^i'^ :
"When one takes part in a fair or tea
for the benefit of the church he first
pays for whatever he decides to do
nate, and then attends the entertain
ment and pays for it again, and al
though the â expense is doubled the
church 'gets the benefit of but one-half
the actual' outlay."

It has developed that Barrow spent
part of his youth in the Whittier' Re
form School, having been, sent there
in 1896 for a two-year term. He was
formerly an employe of the Tesla Coal
Company, from which he is accused
of stealing 300 sacks. His parents
etill refused to assist him to furnish
,fl000 bail.
Marshal Kerns is looking for a third
man, the associate of George Barrow,
incorrigible, and Louis Long, ex-con
vict, who are supposed to be the men
who have been robbing stores around
town with the aid of an auger. From
the junk dealer to whom the two
men under arrest sold the sacks stolen
from the Tesla Coal Company the
Marshal learned that there was a
third man in the deal. The suspects
have so many evil associates, however,
that it will be impossible for the Mar-
Fhal to put his finger on the fellow
until he gets more evidence.
Both Barrow and Long protest their
innocence, claiming that they had
nothing whatever to do with the bur
glaries. They are defiant, too, and
â¢boast that the police will never be
able to convict them..

With one wife on his hands, Vincent
M. Lewis, in the employ of Goldberg,
Bowen & Co., finds himself in the City
Prison charged by. Miss Edna McKay
with failing to keep a promise to wed
her. The young woman declares that
when she accepted Lewis she was igno
rant that he had a spouse, and now
there is a tangle which is giving the
interested parties no end of trouble.
. Lewis was married on December
1900, to Miss Sarah J. Hood, who for
merly lived in Oakland. The wedding
was celebrated at San Rafael., The
groom explained to-day that his wife
and himself parted Immediately after
the ceremony had been concluded and
did not assume marital relations. Â¦' "
Continuing . his explanations, .Lewis
claims that when he was Â¦ accepted- as
the fiance of Miss McKay he had for-!
gotten that the San Rafael marriage
still bound him to another woman.
: It is asserted by Miss McKay's repre
sentatives that Lewis' marriage can be
annuled on the ground that neither the
bride nor the groom were of legal age
to wed without parents' or guardians'
consent. Lewis told Prosecuting Attor
ney A. P. Leach to-day that he was
willing to marry Miss McKay if the
legal obstacles could be set aside. To
that end Police Judge Mortimer Smith
continued the case until Tuesday.

BERLIN, Dec. 4.â Emperor William

said to-day he Intends to review the

: Th>' leading shopkeepers here have
been in a panic over the fear that ihere
would be ho court functions at all this
winter, in which case many of the no
bility would not open their town houses.'
Inquiries .' at court on behalf of the
tradesmen have brought out the assur
ance that some court functions cer
tainly will take place, but that the Em
peror is likely to advance them before
their 'usual dates. The condition of
Emperor -.William elicits a new story
every dajj; to account for "the slowness
of his : recovery.'. This appears to be
due solely, to his having been compelled
by official' work to overstrain his voice
af the' beginning of his illness. .

I CHICAGO, Dec. 4.â F. D. Coburn,
chief of the livestock department of the
Louisiana Exposition at St. Louis, has
been in consultation Â¦ here with a com
mittee of Western range cattlemen re
garding the rules for the admission of
cattle exhibits. The committee assert
ed that If the present rules are en
forced the cattle ranges of the West
and South will be barred, as the rules
specify that no animal Is admissible
unless It has a pedigTee at least on
one side, that exhibits must be Indi-'
vidual and broken to the . halter, and
not more than two In one. class. The
committee , maintained "that- owing to
the large ranges and large herds it -Is
Impossible to follow individual breed
ing and break animals; to the halter.
They ask that the rules be so modified
as to permit exhibits in *car lots, and
the restrictions as to -the halter., and
breeding be eliminated. They contend
that unless these \ changes ;* are ! made
Texas, Colorado and all the other West
ern States would be prevented from en
tering the competition ; j that ' as . Con
gress appropriated over; 55,000,000 from

mittee, also, urged, that cattle from be
low the quarantine line be permitted to
enter, if the board of animal industry
grants a clean bill of health. The rules'
forbid entry, though such cattle can go
anywhere else in the United States.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. 4.â |
Owing to the prevalence of tonsilltis j
among the students of the university
the Students' Guild has deemed it ad- j
visable to arrange a temporary deten- j
tion hospital on the campus in connec
tion with their regular hospital in Palo
Alto In order to care for the three cases
of diphtheria and several cases of ton
silitis of a possibly contagious nature
that have developed on the campus.
The brick building formerly used as a
psychology laboratory has been fitted
up for the purpose and nurses from San
Francisco will be In attendance on the
patients.
That the condition is not considered
serious may be gathered from the fol
lowing extract from the report of Dr.
Snow, the campus* health officer: "A
number of cases of diphtheria now
makes it imperative that all members
of the community suffering from nose j
or throat affections, however slight, j
Bhould place themselves under the ob- ;
servation of a physician at once. The
gravity of the situation lies entirely in
what it may become through negli- J
gence. Prompt action on the part of I
every student in reporting all condi- J
tions of ill health is all that is required t
in controlling the situation." . j

R. G. Dun & Co.'s Weekly Review of
Trad* to-morrow will say: .
Trade is seasonably quiet except in
the lines affected by weather an^d
those embracing holiday goods, which"
are in good demand. Activity is espe
cially conspicuous among footwear
jobbers and retailers. Commodities are
generally lower in price, although a
few important articles, such as cotton,
opgs and dairy products, have risen so
sharply that Dun's index number on
December 1 was 9S.223, against 97,825 j
a month ago. For the year there is a
decline of about 2 per cent. Manufac
turing conditions are still irregular, the
best symptom cf the week being the
steadiness of iron and steeL
Textile-workers still find It difficult
Bettor feeling, approaching optimism
in some lines, is due to improvement
j.n retail trade, stimulated by coW
weather, the advent of the holiday
eczson end the more normal tone of
public sentiment. Jobbing 1 trade in
reasonable goods has also expanded,
as a result of reorders to fill depleted
* locks. Back of these, apparently in
close connection In Its effect upon sen
timent, is the etrong position of the
agricultural staples.
Ccld weather has also stimulated the
coal trade East and "West. More con
fidence Is also shown in the market for
the cruder forms of iron, and prices
are steadier. In the iron and steel trade
shutdowns more than offset resump
tions. Readjustments of wages to
meet new conditions are particularly
prominent In cotton and in iron and
steel, but are belngr accepted with
much less friction than was earlier an
ticipated. Winter weather is causing:
a slowing: down in many lines of build
in?, and lumber and other building ma
terial and hardware are rather less
active for this reason.

Ing the statement cabled from Berlin
December 1 that American Jews are no
longer permitted to cross the Russian
frontier without a special permit in
each case from M. von Plehwe, the
Russian Interior Minister, the authori
ties say no new rules have been issued
in connection with the admission of
American or other Jews. All foreigners
are required to have their passports
vised by Russian consular or diplo
matic agents abroad, and except cer
tain privileged classes, Jews of all na
tionalities sire denied vises in accord
ance with a policy of long standing. It
is fully understood at the State De
partment at Washington that .without
vised passports a special permit is re
quired. In the case of Dr. Cohn of San
Francleco, the facts are that he had
been denied a vise and he applied
through Embassador McCormick for a
permission to spend three weeks in
Warsaw. Minister von Plehwe there
upon readily issued a telegraphic per

Karia a? a consequence, Russia and
Austria have proposed to the other
powers that immediate steps be taken
to put into operation a plan which in
ils general outlines resembles that now

the result of the acceptance in princi-'

mitted to the Porte after the recent
conference between Czar Nicholas and

BERLIN, Dec. 4.â Count von Balles
strorn was to-day re-elected president
of the Reichstag, virtually unani
mously. "â¢
In accepting his re-election as presi
dent of the House for another four
years, Count Ballestrom said he doubt
ed whether his strength could outlast
that period, but so long as he held of
fice he would maintain the dignity of
the Reichstag, "both from within and
without,'" referring doubtlessly to the
incidents of several years ago, when
the Reichstag records were altered
through outside influence.
| All the members of the Reichstag ex
cept the Socialists heartily applauded
the Count's statements. The Socialists
were unable to forgive him for his se
verity toward those who caused disor
der within the chamber. .
Count von Stojlberg-Wernigerode was
elected first vice president and Dr.
Paasche was elected second vice presi
dent. Herr Singer, the Socialist candi

It is learned from trustworthy
sources that Wos y Gil, the deposed
President, is now on his way to the
United States and is expected to land
at New Orleans to-day or to-morrow.
He will come to Washington.
Advices reached Washington that
there are now. three revolutions In
San Domingo, the revolution led by
Morales, a revolution at Monte Christl,
led by the followers of Jiminez, and a
third and stronger revolution in the
south of the island. It appears that
Morales has secured control by an
appeal to the Dominicans that the
United States intended to annex the
island. It is also said that Morales
has received many courtesies from
European representatives in the isl
and, who are also opposed by a step
by the United States in the direction
of asserting the supremacy of its in
terests in the island.

Fatal Quarrel Between Greeks.
BUNSMUIR, Dec. .4.â Two . Greeks
working on the Southern Pacific gang
at Wood Station had an altercation
this afternoon. One of them shot the

The dying man was brought here for

he will not live through the night.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.â Senator Mitchell
introduced a bill to-day providing that every
carrier in the rural free delivery mail service,
in addition to his fixed salary, shall receive
S250 a year for subsistence.
Under the new system there will be,
as under the Princeton system, a stu
dent court to judge of the cases that
may be reported of students caught
cheating, but no pledge will be exacted
of the students not to receive or give
help in examinations nor will they be
pledged to report any one caught cheat-
Ing. . The matter will be left with them
to be determined by their own con
sciences and feelings on the subject and
they may or may not report a fellow
student found cheating. It is hoped
that Id this way a spirit of complete
honesty in examinations will toe fos
tered and the idea of. cheating will be
associated with such a sense of dis
honor that what little cheating at pres
ent is ddne.will be eliminated.

SAN BERNARDINO, Dec. 4.â The
four- year-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Mercer of Banning was attack
ed this morning by a bijr Newfoundland
dog which had been a pet of the fam
ily for a number of years and was. dis
figured for life. The child had started
with the dog for a stroll and when out
oj sight of the house the beast sud
denly turned oh her and knocked her
down. . He fastened his teeth on the f
left side of her face and bracing his
forefeet on" her body, he commenced, to
pull the flesh from her cheek, tearing
off the left ear and laying a great strip
of the living Jlesh hanging from % the
chin.' A laborer working in a nearby
field witnessed the horrible affair and
rushed to the child's assistance! beating
the .brute off. with a club.
Mrs. Merce'r, mother of the child, was
formerly Miss Estelle Patton of Los
Angeles. The rescuer of the child states
that the dog waB e\idently v intent oh

Special Dispatch to The Call,
SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 4.â San Quentin
prison and all its departments are
being thoroughly ransacked for fur
ther evidences . of. opium smuggling.
Cells, bedding and even the wearing ap
parel of the" convicts w.ere closely in
spected to-day. . Yet not an ounce more
of opium was discovered. Warden
Tompklns vehemently asserts he will
turn the whole prison -upside down but
that he will get the drug, if there is
any more inside the walls. He further
proclaims that, while his Jurisdiction
does not. extend farther than the prison
reservation, yet together with the
police department of Marin County he
will unearth other "plants" if such can
be done. He firmly believes that there
is a considerable quantity yet hidden
in convenient places along the roads,
where convicts sometimes are allowed
to go. In order to forestall any more
being gained possession of by the road
gang, the .work on the Greenbrae
boulevard has been stopped and opera
tions .-will not be resumed until the
whole matter Is cleared up.
While Warden Tompkins is personal
ly conducting'the inspection inside the
prison walls Captain Russell, chief of
ficer, of the guard, is diligently ferret
ing out possible hiding places Inside the
prison reservation. He Is a' most care
ful official and has been' a prison at
tache for many years. Owing to there
having been so many new guards ap
pointed since the commencement of
the Tompklns regime Captain Russell
has experienced a difficult problem* in
the selection of his "searching squad."
He has been most careful and any or
dinary scheme for smuggling stuff in
side would have been easily detected.
The one in vogue, however, putting the
opium in small tobacco sacks, was an
entirely new idea and easily escaped
the vigilance of the inspection. As .a
matter of fact, as it was when Gonzales
was being searched, the inspector asked
him what he had In his shirt. He re
plied: "Two sacks of tobacco; do you
want to see them." So brazen was the
convict that the guard was unsuspect
ing and let him pass.
The three Mexicans will have their
preliminary hearing to-morrow. Jus
tice Magee of this city will act as com
mitting magistrate and District Attor
ney Boyd will prosecute the case. The
hearing will be held In the Warden's
office at 10:30 o'clock.

Something akin to a cloud of conster
nation began to settle on-the legal lu
minaries yesterday in Judge Conlan's
court when his Honor started In to pass
sentence upon the array of offenders
who had been convicted of various of
fenses before him. The unusual heavi
ness of the doses of imprisonment ad
ministered caused the attorneys with
cases pending to view, the proceedings
with alarm, and the unanimity with
which they called for continuances was
significant.
It was a sort o*-6ix-months series that
his Honor Conlan dealt out. "Thomas
Kelley, the passer of Confederate cur
rency upon trustful grocers in the West
em Addition, got six months for each'of
the three convictions against him, and
as quickly as one half-year's durance
ends another begins. Fred _ MIchels Â»for

INSANE ADMITTED
THAT HE i MAY BE TBEATED
Campos is a native of Portugal, and
in March,, 1903, took out his first papers
of declaration of intention to become
an American citizen. He had been
working as fireman on American ves
sels for the last five years. He took
a voyage to Mexico on the steamer Cu
racao recently foT^ the benefit of his
health,. and returned on the same ves
sel. The immigration officials caused
him to be examined by the United
States I Marine Hospital surgeon,* \who
reported that he was suffering from
tubercle of the lungs, a contagious dis
ease. The Immigrant Bureau holds
that the taking out of "first papers"
does not make an alien a citizen for
the purpose of immigration.
The secretary of the union has ap
pealed to' Secretary Cortelyou on be
half of Campos.
Jose Campos, a member of the Pacific
Coast . Marine Firemen's Union, has
been- denied a landing by the Federal
immigration officers, bn the ground
that although he left this State only a
short time ago and is now returning,
he is an alien afflicted with a conta
gious disease, and as such is not enti
tled to be landed.

So a complaint of contempt was
drawn and duly filed against the iras
cible Mr. Cunningham, and some time
to-day he will ascertain Just how much
imprisonment he. provoked by his
breach of etiquette.^,'.
"You evidently think you're still bul
lying a barroom," quietly said the
Judge to the choleric prisoner, "and it
shall be my pleasure to convince you
that you are mistaken." *
Edward Cunningham, a b'g, strapping
longshoreman, allowed his temper to
override his discretion while a witness
was testifying against him before Judge
Mogan, with the result that a charge
of contempt of court was added to the
accusation of malicious mischief, on
which he had been arrested.
M. J. McVey, who manages a saloon
on East street, was telling the court of
how Cunningham had started to wreck
his wet-goods emporium, when the nar
rative was interrupted by the defend
ant shouting: "You're a double-blanked
liar." The rebuke of the scoffer was
prompt.
"FIRST PAPER" ALIENS
NOT DEEMED . CITIZENS
Harry Losh, an office boy connected
with a morning newspaper, is the com
plaining witness in Judge Slogan's
court agriinst Edward Fountain, Fred
Muller and John Condon, and Police
man "Bill" Harrison and Special Of
flcer John Conway are witnesses for
the prosecution.
Losh saya that he was passing Third
and Market streets about 2 o'clock
yesterday morning, whistling a merry
lay as he walked, when the three de
fendants cast gribes at his ability as a
whistler and then assaulted him. His
cries for aid attracted Special Officer
Conwaj-, who "mixed in," and Jhe bat
tle royal was raging fast and furiously
when Policeman Harrison arrived,
evened up the odds and arrested Foun
tain, Muller and Condon.
The case went over till next Mon
day.
During the month of November last
the health inspectors under Chief Hass
!er condemned as unfit for human con
sumption 107,720 pounds of fish, Â£S55
pounds cf beef, 178 head of calves, 201 j
sheep, eight lambs, eleven hogs, 1400
chickens, 182 turkeys, 200 ducks and
geese and 110 hams.
Much. Bad Food Condemned.
A bench warrant was Issued by
Judge Mogan for William Germandt.a
member of Fire Engine Company No.
28, who had been arrested for ill
treating his minor child. Charlotte,
and released on $20 bail. The bail
may be forfeited, as rumor had it that
Germandt had departed from the city.
Pasadero Savadero peddled ducks
that had been drowned Instead of shot
and Game Warden Ault arrested him
for imperiling public health. , x
It was proven to the satisf action of
Judge Mogan that ducks which have
not been slaughtered in the conven
tional *way are unfit for human food,
as their demise is not sanguinary, 'and
it was also explained to the court that
sometimes drowned ducks are punc
tured with wire to give their skin a
false appearance of having been pene
trated by leaden pellets discharged
from a shotgun.
Savadero's case was continued till
next Wednesday, when It is understood
he will plead guilty and pay the $25
penalty for such offense made and
provided.
Tears and threats flew thick and
fast in the tribunal of Cabaniss while
Mrs. Tillie Taylor, a nortly and mid
dle-aged woman, was reluctantly tes
tifving against a young fellow named
John E. Salvey, arrested for robbing
her of a purse containing $50. Mrs.
Taylor pleaded to be excused from
prosecuting the defendant, but the
court was inexorable, and . word by
word the story of womanly kindness
and unmanly ingratitude was wrung
from her.
She owns a restaurant on Post street,
Mrs. Taylor does, and Salvey was em
ployed by. her until she was compelled
to discharge him for habitual intem
perance. 'But after he ceased to work'
for her he was given a meal when he
: asked for It, and last Tuesday evening,
after eating dinner at one of her tables,
i he approached her as she stood at the
i cash counter, snatched a money bag
â¢ suspended from her neck, and dashed
through the open doorway. Her screams
attracted the attention of a passing po
t liceman, who soon overtook and ar
rested the fugitive. Mrs. Taylor filed
a charge of robbery against him, and
at that time seemed to be eager to
i prosecute, but when called to testify
! yesterday it was evident that she had
j undergone a change of purpose.
: "Please don't ask me to send the poor
young man to prison," she pleaded.
! "Why are you unwilling to prosecute
i him?" inquired the Judge.
"Because," was the sobbing reply, "1
was brought\up as a true Christian,
and I believe In forgiving those who In
jure us."
"You should have thought of that be
fore you filed your charge against the
defendant,' was /Prosecutor Handley's
comment.
Not until she was threatened with
punishment for contempt of court
j would Mrs. Taylor state her case, and
then her story was thickly punctuated
with heartfelt sobs.
Judgment was reserved till Decem
ber 8.

With these extenuating circum
stances in consideration the court dis
missed Look and ordered that his
armament be restored to him.
Look and his attorney and several
witnesses satisfied the court that the
big shooting Iron was unloaded at the
time of its capture, and that Look, far
from carrying it with felonious Intent,
was trying to pledge it for $10 when
the policeman nabbed him.
- A. revolver, that loomed large in the
hands of the complaining policeman,
was found in possession of Chew Gin
Look when he emerged from a Sacra
mento-street pawnshop last Thursday
afternoon, and the charge against him
before Judge Mogan yesterday was
that of carrying concealed weapons.
Henry Brown, colored, sought leniency
at the hands of Judge Mogan by plead
ing that the drunk charged against him
had been acquired in Oakland, where
he dwells.
"What . did you bring it over here
for?" inquired the Judge.
"I doan know, sah," replied the pris
oner. "You see, when a gemman gets
loaded he doan know why he does
things that he wouldn't do when W is
sobah."
"Well, Henry," was the court's com
ment, "we have'all the drunks *>f home
manufacture that we can conveniently
tak^ care of, and I hope that when you
have spent twenty-four hours more in
the cells upstairs you will return to
Oakland with a resolve to finish your
next drunk in the town where you ab
sorbed It."
Mr. Brown courteously bowed to the
judgment and was withdrawn.
When a man named George Bean,
was arraigned before Judge Mogan for
stealing a pair of trousers his attorney
facetiously moved for dismissal' on the
ground that "a suit can't be made out
of a pair of pants." When the court
finally grasped the pun he .-remarked
that a pair of nether garments were
sufficient to make a case, and held the
defendant for hearing.
Vosti notified police headquarters
ar.d turned over the blackjack to De
tectives DInan and Wren, who were
detailed on the case. Vosti had a wound
in his scalp stitched and dressed by a
physician. He was able to give a de
scription of the taller of the two rob
bers, but said he was unable to get a
pood look at the smaller one. who is
supposed to have wielded the blackjack.
The police have so far been unable to
locate the bold footpads.
A darir.s hold-up was committed at
the . nmrire lodging-house, â¬40 Clay
Ftreet. within a block of police head
. uariers. shortly after 3 o'clock yester
day morning, the victim being C. Vosti,
i he night clerk, who was knocked down
by a blow- on the head with a blackjack
and relie%'ed of $9 4Â«.
About 3:20 o'clock two men. one tall
ard the other short, knocked on the
door cf the ofllce, which li close to the
top of the first lanfilng. Before open
ing the door Vcsti asked them what
they wanted, and the taller of the two
said they wanted a room for the night.
VoBti opened the door, and as he did
eo the tall can shoved a revolver in
his face and told him to throw up his
hands. Vosti grappled with the foot
pad, but was knocked down and ren
dered partly unconscious. One of the
footpads went through his pockets and
took all the money he had. 59 ,45. They
had evidently been geared away, as
they made no attempt to open the cash
drawer in the office, and !n their hurry
to get away left a blackjack on the
floor.
"The commission men feel that they
have not had a hearing, for no charges
were preferred against them. As we
attorneys take the law, a man cannot
be tried or given a hearing until!
charges are preferred against him. j
That affidavit which the commission
took as formal charges against the
commission men was not filed until
after the testimony of the witnesses
was taken. The Commissioners did not
ask Graves if he wanted to let his af
fidavit stand as charges against the
commission men,* until the commission
men had testified. So there were really
r.o charges against them. In Graves'
affidavit the names of none of the com
mission firms but, Scatena & Co. were
mentioned, so that even though it had
been filed in time the board would not
have charges against the commission
men as a whole. At the hearing all
who testified said , they had never
formed any conspiracy, agreement _or
understanding to sell goods at. a high
rate on the State wharves. Outside of
; the State property the Commissioners
have no power.
"I have heard nothing in regard to
MEECHANTS GOT NO TRIAL.
Attorney J. B. Reinstein said that he
had merely been engaged, and that the
commission men had not determined
Just what course they would pursue in
regard to the revoking of their licenses.
They will come together in a few days
and the opinions of the majority will
be taken and the action based on their
dpcislon as to the best way out of the
trouble.
"The commission men of the city, will
undoubtedly stand together, for the de
cision affects them all. We who went
up before the board were merely repre
sentative firms of the commission busi
ness."
Charles Spear, president of the
board, yesterday said: "The board
thought that it was Just as well to
bring this matter to a head at this
time. Notices were issued.
"The Commissioners do not want to
be brash In this matter and twenty
four hours will be allowed the mer
chants to remove their goods.
"I understand that they have re
tained an attorney and will attempt
by law to find out the powers of the
board. Last summer, when the law
went Into effect, many of the commis
sion men doubted whether they would
take out the permits. But after con
sideration they concluded that they
should do so. They knew the obliga
tions attached to the granting of a
permit and have suffered the result
of breaking them."
George E. Wolf of the firm of Wolf &
Sons of 321 Davis street in speaking of
the board's action said: "My brother
was the one who attended the meeting
of the commission Thursday, and he
has left town for a few days. When he
returns the commission men will In
all probability get together and lay
their case before the people. We have
been pictured as a lot of blackguards.
The revoking of this firm's permit will
not affect our business, as we buy direct
from the farmer and pay him cash for
what we get, eo that we really do not
do what might be called a commission
business, it is the duty, however, of
the commission men to stand together,
and they will do so. Just what course
they will pursue I cannot say at this
time, as no plan has been decided. We
have secured the services of a lawyer."
John G. Wetmore of the firm of Wet
more Bros., 415 Washington street,
said: "We have taken, no definite steps.
In a few days we shall get- together
and decide what to do. I do not think
the Harbor Commission Is desirous of
ruining our business. Of course, their
taking away our right to sell perishable
goods on the wharves will not affect us
a great deal except for the inconve
nience. The farmers will be the suffer
ers, for In case we do not regain the
privilege they will be compelled to pay
the cartage on their goods from the
wharves to the commission houses. At
this time of the year the action of the
board does not affect the business of
this firm much, as we are handling but
little in the perishable line. The main
hardship will be on the merchants that
cell potatoes and onions. The commis
sion had no specific charges against us,
but tried us on a general charge, which
was over and above the Jurisdiction of
the board. I have heard nothing said
in regard to the rest of the houses giv
ing up their permits and doing all of
their business at the commission
houses. I don't think any such move
has been contemplated.
SAYS TIME HAD COME.
Notifications were sent out yester
day to all four of the houses that had
their permits revoked and the Chief
Wharfinger of the Harbor Commis
sion was instructed to see that these
merchants do no more business on
State property.
This rumor was met with a general
denial from the commission mer
chants and their attorney, J. B. Rein
stein. No plans have been formed as
yet and nothing will be done in the
matter for two days, when the com
mission merchants of the city will
hold a large meeting and determine
on the course they shall pursue.
The majority of the commission
men 6eem to be little bothered by the
Harbor Board's action. They say
that in case they are compelled to
cart their goods from the wharves be
fore they can sell them the farmers
will be compelled to pay the cartage
and mercantile profits will remain
the same. The raisers of the fruit and
vegetables will then be the actual suf
ferers.
There was a rumor aroun'd yester
day that the commission men would
all turn In their permits to sell per
ishable goods on the State wharves
to the Harbor Board and continue
their business at their stores. It was
stated that the commission merchants
would merely raise the price of the
perishable products handled by them
in order to defray* the cost of cartage
from the wharves.
Ginsburg ''Â¦ continued his visits to the
Goldsmith house, and the master of the
household feared he was a "grafter"
and pointedly Invited him to stay away.
Goldsmith had read a lot about "porch
climbers," "second-story workers" and
footpads, and he pictured Ginsburg as
being all three.
Ginsburg happened to pass Gold
smith's jewelry store, at 101% O'Farrell
street, yesterday. The owner stepped
out and held the young man In conver
sation, and when a policeman was
passing Goldsmith Informed the officer
that a detective was looking for Gins
burg. Much to the latter's surprise and
disgust he was taken into custody.
Ginsburg stated in the City Prison
that he came from New York and is of
a good family. He said he served in the
Philippines and had purchased his dis
charge after serving two years. He said
he was only "stringing" the Goldsmiths
and meant no harm. He said he was
not a "grafter" and had never been im
prisoned.
The police are looking up Ginsburg's
record, and .will not allow him to go
until he satisfactorily accounts for his
peculiar conduct.
Ginsburg proved a fluent talker and
impressed Mrs. Goldsmith; but the hus
band was more practical. He took the
young man's statements with a grain
of salt and did a little private inves
tigating on his own "hook. He soon
learned that Girisburg was traveling
under the name of Harry Long, was an
ex-private In the Second Battalion. En
gineer Corps, lived at 454% Minna street
and was "on his uppers."
The next time Ginsburg called at the
house his reception was less fervent,
and . the Goldsmiths, knowing his true
character, drew him out to see how
many ' falsehoods he could tell.
Ginsburg outdid himself on his second
visit. He had lots of things to tell about
himself. He reached. a climax when he
informed Miss Clara Magee, a young
lady residing with the Goldsmiths, that
he (would engage her to be his stenog
rapher, and Invited hej^ to go to the
office he claimed to rent In the Claus
Spreckels building. * /
GINSBURG IS AJtBESTED.
He also told Mrs. Goldsmith that he
was staying at the Palace Hotel, was a
major In the United States army, was
a graduate of West Point, was a civil
engineer by profession, intended open
ing an office in the Claus Spreckels
building, had lots of money and a few
other things, all of which were found
to be untrue.
MANY WILD STATEMENTS.
..Harry Ginsburg, aJias Harry Long,
an ex-soldier, occupies a cell in the
City Prison because he tried to outdo
the f ar-fameM Ananias. As a teller of
stories that have no foundation In fact
the youthful prevaricator has few
equals in this practical century. No
charge has been placed against .tnÂ«
young man," because he has committed
no crime, but the police are holding
him in the hope that a few days' im
prisonment will lead him into the paths
of truth. Ginsburg owes his incarcera
tion to J. Goldsmith, a Jeweler, resid
ing at 633 McAllister street. A week
ago the ex-soldier called on the Gold
smith famfly in the hope of finding a
relative. Hia home Is in New York,
and according to his statement his
mother had written him to hunt up an
alleged brother who ehe thought was
living in San Francisco. Ginsburg im
mediately went in (juest of the relative,
and in the course of his wanderings
visited Mr. Goldsmith. He presented a
typewritten letter, which he said his
mother had sent him.

Mrs. â¢ Elizabeth Burns and Mrs. Rose

"Wednesday for final adjustment of
their contention.
Mrs. Klatt was there as complain
ing witness against Mrs. Burns, and
the charge was assault and battery.
From the testimony adduced by the
two women and their* respective
spouses it was deduced that Mrs.
Burns' 12-year-old daughter had way
laid the 10-year-old daughter of Mrs.
Klatt while the latter girl was re
turning from the corner grocery to her
home with a pound of butter. Little
Miss Burns wrested the dairy product
from the hands of little Miss Klatt
and bespattered her and the sidewalk
with it, and when Mrs. Klatt went to
demand an explanation from Mrs.
Burns she was punched twice in the
face by that lady. Hence the court
proceedings. ;â¢ ,% â¢ * â¢Â¦
Mrs. Burns entered a fiat denial of
Mrs. Klatt's accusation and assever
ated also that there had been no trou
ble at any time between the two chil
dren. When asked if it were not pos
sible for the maidens to have had an
altercation on the street without her
knowledge, Mrs. Burns positively de
clared that It was not, because she
sat at her window all day and saw
everything that occurred within her
scope of vision. Indeed, iso positive
was Mrs. Burns that the court reject

pleaded in extenuation of her implac
ability that she was laboring under

REGAL SHOES.
J^egal Shoes appeal strongly to the
; . young -mm who wants style and
who mustliaye wear. He gets more
style in Regals at $3.50 than he can
get, in any â¢other; shoe Tinder $12 a pair. And he gets
good solid wear* as well. ,
Another man- who wears Regal shoes is the business
man who can well .afford to pay any price he pleases for
his shoes, but whose business instinct â the sense that has
made him ricli-^will not permit him to pay $12 when he
can get just as good for $3.50.
A third sort of man buys Regal shoes chiefly because
they wear well â^they/give more serviceable wear per
dollar of cost than any other shoe at any price, and they
are comfortable every minuteâ you don't have to break
them in. v ) '
The Regal proposition should appeal to every mer-
chant and manufacturer because it is based on economy
of production and; low cost of handling and selling. It ia
sensible and susceptible of plain proof.
A success like tHis cannot be built on super-heated
* atmosphere. Investigate and you will surely wear Regal
Shoes."
There are 6o Regal Stores â 20 of them in Greater New
York, where the styles -originate. The new "styles arcon sale in
our San Francisco store at the same time as in the New York
stores. Other dealers get the same styles a year later.

FOR a week ears' held the as the highest
.priced thing in sight, and one ear was sold for
$5000, fixing the value of a pair at $10,000. There
is some association between ears and cotton, for that
material is used ,to plug them, for, protection against the
blasts of winter. No sooner did ears go up than cotton
followed and bulls, and bears in the Cotton Exchange
were sooivby the cars.
The price reached was 12.59 cents per pound, which is
the highest cotton since the civil war. "* There were pre
dictions that 25-cent cotton -will soon be seen, but that
seems hardly probable, since such a price would limit the
use of the fiber. The Southerni cotton planter finds
himself approaching nabobery in these prices, as the rise
catches the crop largely in the hands of the producer. â¢
As a rise in one fiber is felt by-others it may be ex
pected that wool and flax .-will .respond. When clothing
is high there", is a tendency to economize in food and
high 'cotton may- cause low wheat. This tendency.' to
equalize. the prices of staples is inevitable, and is a process
by. which- the^ gains of production 1 are equalized, and in a
long run of years the grower of fibers and the grower of
wheat come out neck and neck.
In one aspect the cotton question is of some importance
to California. It -is believed -that the accidents.' to the,
crop in the South will always produce ; these fluctuations

England's warships are hovering on the Venezuelan

Iceland's Quarrel.
"A political quarrel of more than
thirty years' standing. between Iceland
and Denmark has at last been set
tled," says the Pall Mall Gazette.
"The Icelanders, who speak a lan
guage different from Danish â in fact,
their tongue Is very nearly that of the
old â¢ Norse Edda â have incessantly
contended that between that country
and Denmark there could only be the
"golden link of the crown." In mak
ing this claim they went by ancient
historical traditions of still greater
freedom. Their claim was that there
should be a special Minister for Ice
land, who should reside at Reykjavik
and be a native of the island.
- "Hitherto the Danish Minister of
Justice was at the same time the Min
ister for Iceland, and 'he, residing at
Copenhagen, was not required to know
the Icelandic language. This was held
to be sore grievance, especially "when
the Althing, or Parliament, was assem
bled, and the Danish Governor at
Reykjavik had often to correspond by
letter from the often storm-bound isle,
with the authorities at Copenhagen,
there being no. telegraphic cable. Now
the Danish Government -has yielded
to the demand of the Icelanders and
the Althing has given its assent to the
bill in question. As a curious , fact, it
may be mentioned that the island,
with a population of but 80,000. has
an upper and a lower house, of twelve
and twenty-four members, each easily
gecotn"""' 0 *"' in an ordinary room.
Japan and Russia have apparently decided' to stop
snarling at one another and live. iff that peace which is
the child of mutual fear.' It is surely China's turn to have
good cause for alarm, 1 for both her militant neighbors may
have seen the wisdom of despoiling her of what both
want â her. rich, lands and revenues. .
The uproar of the calamity howlers, raised in violence
and antagonism to our glorious natio'nal institution, inter
collegiate football, has been silenced by the bludgeon of
the statistician. There were only nineteen young men
killed on the gridiron during the splendid season just
closed, and reflect on the fun thousands of others had
while these were dying.

Fives riotice of the arrival of William

in the following: ; ;--y ' j
'.'That most interesting individuality
W. J. Bryan, who is on a visit to this
country, is only 43 years old. He fir3t
distinguished himself in America as an
orator who advocated the tariff tor/
revenue only. He was elected to Con- Â».
gress in 1890, and became a conspicuoua
supporter of the free coinage of silver
till 1S9S, when he was nominated for
the Presidency, to- the surprise of
everybody. Andrew Carnegie in criti
cising his policy referred to him as
'Bryan the conjurer,' but added. 'He
and his wife are models of purity in
their simple lives, kind neighbors and
earnest in their desire to do their part
toward making the world a little bet
ter.' "
After much solemn discourse and patient inquiry the
Grand Jury at Honolulu has discovered that "graft" has
been one of the systematic and highly successful elements
of activity in the Hawaiian Legislature. One would sus
pect from the flutter of the press of the islands that a
discovery of something foreign to affairs legislative had
been made. The unexpected happens when no "graft" is
found.
Dignity in Peril.
Judge Henry A. Melvin of the Su
perior Court of Alameda County is a
great devotee of music. Possessor of
a fine barytone voice, the jurist finds
much enjoyment for himself as well
as his friends -whenever he uses his
vocal talents. But Judge Melvin has
a zest for his work on the bench, and
when he is sitting, dignity of the law
is personified in the able young mag
istrate.
The other day the judicial dignity
was nearly overturned in confusion,
all because Judge Melvin will persist
in singing. His Honor was on the
bench in his courtroom in Oakland in
the midst of a serious legal argument
involving important questions of tech
nical construction. With brow knit
and lips pursed in much' contempla
tion of the learned counsel's. points,
Judge Melvin' did not observe that a
young and, sad to relate, very inex
perienced newspaper man had made
his way to the bench. Tapping the
thought burdened arbiter on the
shoulder, the youthful newsgatherer
said in a tone that filled the court
ro"btn:
"Say, Judge, what are you going to
sing Sunday morning at the Eplscor
pal church?"
Do You Believe It?
Now the New York Tribune prints
this story in all Beriousness. With all
due respect to our Arizona contem
porary we will not be held responsible
for the tale. Here it is:
"About four year* ago, according to
the Prescott (Ariz.) Courier, Charles
Erwin paid a visit to the petrified for
est of Arizona, and while there left a
large sombrero under the natural
bridge near the falls, and in such a
position that the water dripped on It.
One side of the rim was pinned up to
the crown and therein was worked
with a cord the letters, 'C. E.' In this
place the hat remained until about a
month ago, when Mr. and Mrs. George
Ruffner were visiting the place. Er
win gave them a description of the lo
cation of his 'plant* and thither they
went and found the hat. A complete
petrificatlon of the chapeau had taken
place. It was absolutely stone. Mrs.
Ruffner brought it home with her and
now has It. regarding it as one of the
choice curios of her many travels."
Dust Storms.
BY GEORGE FREDERICK WRIGHT,
A. M., LU D.
fAuihor of "The Ice Age in North America."
"Man and the Glacla! Period," etc.]
(Copyright. 1903, by Joseph B. Bowles.)
Our last article dealt with the geo
logical agency of the wind as seen in
Its transportation of immense quanti
ties of sand and the piling up in many
localities of great sand dunes. A still
more important movement in some "re
spects is that of fine dust suspended
in the air until it is carried long dis
tances. Mr. Darwin describes one such
storm encountered by him near, the
Cape Verde Islands, which had been
brought 1600 miles from land. In 1846 a
dust shower passed over Southern
France which it is estimated deposited
fully 1,000,000 pounds ol dust over a
limited area. This dust contained in
numerable minute shells of microscopic
organisms, which could be traced to the
plains of Â§outh America. Such dust
storms are frequent west of the Mis
souri River, where sometimes for days
together the sun will be almost- ob
scured by the dust held in suspension
by the moving wind. The material ha3
been swept off from the arid regions to
the west and is being slowly deposited
over the better watered" region of the
east. ~ *

ial being swept off from the arid
plains of Central Asia. I well remem
ber traveling for a whole half day
through such a storm 1C0 miles west
of Peking, when it was impossible to
distinguish objects half way across
the road. The burial of whole cara
vans in such dust storms, 'in which,
however, sand was the principal in
gredient, is not uncommon. It is es
timated by Geikie that thousands of
feet of soil have been removed by
wind over thousands of square miles
of some of the arid plains drained by
the Colorado River and its tributaries.
Nor Is the action of wind . limited
to the removal of the loose dust which
had accumulated upon the surface.
But, picking up the particles of sand
and driving them before^ it, it pro
duces the sand blast, which polishes
the rocks against which it is driven,
and often undermines ledges, so that
they topple over. In many places in
Wyoming and Utah large blocks of
sandstone and, limestone have been
thus acted upon by the drifting sand
about their base,, until they seem to
stand on narrow pedestals, only wait
ing for a little more of this peculiar
erosion to make them topple over. By
these constant sand blasts the sur
faces of many of the hardest mate
rials are etched into furrows and
wrinkles. The . abrading* and polish
ing effect of wind blown sands j has
long been noticed on Egyptian monu
ments exposed to sand drift from the
Libyan Desert.
A frequent effect of wind blown
sand is that of changing the course of
rivers. The sand dunes accumulat
ing across the course of streams in
Southwestern Michigan and on' the
coast of France present many, illustra
tions. It will be found in j the most
of such streams In Michigan that their
outlets have been obstructed by sand
blown in from the southwest, 'so that
their mouths have been pushed grad
ually to the north, where they are
making a" vigorous and successful ef
fort to wear a channel through the
Kand as fast, as It. blows in ' Â¦

The New York Tribune remarks that
"that voracious and disgusting insect
known as the cockroach is no longer
to be tolerated in the wardroom, pan
try, the captain's cabin, the bread lock
ers of the crew or cnywhere else in
the navy. An expert cockroach killer
has offered his services to- eradicate the
pesky good-for-nothing from all of the
war vessels and the buildings at the
Atlantic coast navy yards, asking a
specific amount for each ship and naval
station. His process for the killing of
roaches Is a secret one. but he has done
some . verv effective work cm some of
the yessels. He will next try his hand
at League Island, where the roaches
are reported to be both troublesome an.i
destructive. TTis original demand was
$100 a ship, but the Navy Department
has effected a compromise with him
whereby the charges are reduced about
one- half."

fleas, by all that is holy send him to

they themselves had made a thorough

cerning the probable cause of the dis
aster. They even threw a cordon of
employes about the building, with in
structions to allow no one to enter who
claimed to be from the press.

Whoever W. S. Harwood may be. he
has some unpleasant things to say
about California in The "World To-day.
Listen:
"What these Californians need to do,
winter and summer, is to quit talking
about real estate, stop the everlasting
civic strife, give over the thought that
there will ever De great cities in this
region, iut the knife Into all booms
and splurges, and give themselves to
a study of the question: How can we
make our cities the most attractivs
cities on the globe?
"Nature has given more than her
share. She has put the sptendid moun
tains In place, spread a noble blue sea
at their feet, given a climate such as
no other region on earth can match,
winters and summers of equal beauty;
she has \ provided for the enrichment
and adornment of city and hamlet and
country place. But she did not provide
these real estate sharks, nor these
slovenly, slouchy boarding-house keep
ers, nor these stuffy, ramshackle,
down-at-the-heel apartments for rent,
where festers the meanest and nastiest
lot of furniture that ever escaped the
junkshop and where disease lurks In Its
most dreadful form."
ENGLAND and France having composed their an
cient differences by a treaty of arbitration, thereby
rendering the Continental balance of power of less
importance in British politics, it is now proposed to-re
new the" effort to secure an arbitration treaty between
the-United States and Great Britain.' Such a treaty was
negotiated by Mr 'McKinley and Secretary of State
Hay, but was defeated in the Senate.
When it was under consideration in the Senate there
was offered the somewhat amazing spectacle of certain
Irish members of the British Parliament opening head
quarters in Washington to advocate defeat of the treaty.
They were sought by United States Senators and their
interference and advice in a political matter domestic to
this country wer.e influential in defeating the treaty.
Since then the relations of , England and Ireland have
become more" amicable. The new land bill and the visit
of King Edward to Ireland have* mitigated much of the
harshness that for centuries has characterized the rela
tions of the two countries. It is therefore probable that
a new treaty may be considered on its merits free from
foreign interference.
- Viewed from the standpoint of American interests such
a treaty is as honorable as it is necessary. The United
States and Great Britain led the way in the arbitration of
issues which had in them the smell of powder and the
potency of war. When the Alabama claims went to the
Geneva court and Great Britain without hesitation abided
by the award- and paid it promptly, a great step forward
was taken in the interest of peace and civilization. Since
then the two countries have arbitrated the Bering Sea
status and Mr. Blaine's claim that it was a mare clausum
was decided against us and jn favor of Great Britain and
we accepted the award and promptly upon proper adju
dication paid indemnity to the British sealers whose,
property we had seized. Next followed the Alaskan
boundary, and to the everlasting honor of British justice
and judicial character the Lord Chief Justice of Great
Britain decided that in our favor.
England is - our only, European neighbor in North
America." We do not covet her possessions here, but
contiguity, breeds friction and no wisdom nor foresight
can predict whence nor when it may come. There are
uneasy and adventurous spirits in all countries, who fo
ment international trouble for the purpose of causing
war, a cqndition dear to the hearts of all disturbers oÂ£
peace and soldiers of fortune. The peace of these two
great nations should not be left to the Dugald Dalgettys
of the world. If a solemn treaty exist pledging the two
countries to substitute arbitration for war the profes
sional disturbers of the "world's peace will have less
temptation to cause a friction because it will lead to arbi
tration and not to war.
From a proper American standpoint such a treaty,
wisely, phrased, respectful of the national honor of both
countries, is a proper object of patriotic desire. Progress
and commerce, human happiness and its orderly pursuit
require peace and are hindered by .war. Such a treaty
secures for them stability, and to conclude it would be
the crowning glory of American diplomacy.
France and Great Britain found no, insurmountable
barrier to such an agreement, though the frictions be
tween them, Continental and colonial, have been numer
ous and constant and French prejudice had been recently
active and virulent. Conditions between us since the
Alaska award have * been especially invitfng and both
countries should take advantage of them now without
waiting for a change.

"Our own country is the child of
Ihe locomotive.'" So wrote Char!es
Francis Adams .Jr. thirty-three years
;jgo, and if true then, the saying
siPms doubly true to-day. Robert
Louis Stevenson, writing of the first
transcontinental line, said: "It seems
if* pie as if this railway were the one
typical achievement of the age in
â¢which we live." President Hadley of
Yale University has written of the
railroad as working the industrial rev
olution of the nineteenth century, and
i"ompares this revolution with the po
litical revolution of the eighteenth
century.
Thus three great minds, viewing
the subject from different standpoints,
.tgTee in accepting the railroad as the
greatest produrt of the century lhat
has passed; and it is, in the century
that is opening, the greatest power in
the business and civilization of the
United States. Yet loss than seventy
five years ago there was not a single
mile of railroad in the country. It is
only fifty years ago when continuous
.'â¢aiiroad communication between Xew
York and Chicago was established,
and it is only thirty-three years â a
single generation â since the conti
nent was spanned by an iron way.
In 1830 there were only twenty
three miles of railroad track in this
country, and for several years prior
to that date the process of railroad
< obstruction developed clumsily and
haltingly. Englishmen, boasting of the
achievements of George Stephenson
and the Newcastle mine owners in
operating serviceable cars on station
ary rails, came over here to show
their American cousins how to build
and operate railways. Xearry all of
ihe first- projects were utter failures,
and there was much complaint on the
part of the early railroad builders of
Uie lack of interest in their, efforts
manifested in the communities in
Â»\ hich they were working. â¢ *
When Lafayette visited this country
in 1824 there was some talk on the
part of his enthusiastic entertainers of
giving him a ride on a real railroad.
This part of the programme had to be
omitted, however, because there was
no railroad in operation. On April 2,
1823, the New York State Legislature
granted a charter to the Delaware and
Hudson Canal Company to" build a
canal and a railroad from the coal
fields of Pennsylvania to Rondout, on
the Hudson River. This company did
not complete its gravity railroad until
1829. In the meantime a variety of
experiments were made in New Tork,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Mary
land by men of wealth and energy,
who foresaw that the old stage coach
must give way to some mechanical
means of transportation. One of the
most ardent supporters of the railroad
idea at that time was the patriotic
Colonel Stevens of Stevens Castle, Ho
boken.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The first rails laid were strips of
wood on crossties of timber and stone.
Subsequently thin strips of iron were
held in place by driving stout pegs into
the ground at each end. The original
railway car was a four-wheeled ve
hicle shaped like an ordinary road
carriage and capable of seating four
persons. At first the wheels were
grooved, but the groove speedily gave
way to the flange. The locomotive of
that period was practically a steam
boiler with steam chest and piston
rod set on a flat car. A box or bar
rel filled- with fuel occupied the rear
part of this â car. Pine knots and
hickory wood were chiefly* used for
feel, a liberal supply of pine knots
being carried for, danger signals when
ever these primitive trains were run
at night.
Many and wonderful have been the
improvements in railway appliances
and methods since then, yet the man
v.ho ran with blazing torch ahead of
the slow moving coach motor per
formed thesame responsible duty that
the penetrating headlight, the electrical
block signal, the swinging gemaphbre
and the watchful trackman perform
now. Some of the locomotives built in
the early *20's, before the advent of the
De Witt Clinton, when they ventured
out after dark pushed a small platform
car on which there was a vessel of
blazing material. This was the first
type of locomotive headlight. A loco
motive in those days cost from 5150 to
$200. Through a gradual process of evo
lution the railway locomotive is now al
most as elaborate a piece of machinery
as the perfected printing press, and Its
cost is In the neighborhood of $15,000.
The patriarch of the great railroad
systems of to-day is the Baltimore and
Ghio. This company was chartered in
Maryland on February 28. 1827, and in
Virginia the following March. Con
struction was begun In Baltimore with
much pomp and ceremony on July 4,
1S2S. The work of building this road
progressed slowly. After the first flush
of enthusiasm the public Interest in the
project died out, and only a few earnest
men were left to carry it to completion;
It was nearly two years after the pre
tentious ceremonies in Baltimore, that
the first fifteen-mile section was opened
from Baltimore to Ellicotts Mills. The

â¢ Preliminary steps of preparation have been taken to
provide a fitting, representation of San Francisco at the
St. Louis Exposition. It is,' high time that such meas
ures should.be under consideration. Other counties of
the State have their plans well under way, and if we de
lay much longer, we might be forced to the expediency
of sending 'a map of the State to show that we are on
earth. â¢ Â¦
THE CALL recently advised the complaining, pro
ducers not to assume that the Harbor Commission
ers were averse to the enforcement of the Wood
ward law. That law was passed in response to The
Call's demand, made long ago and persistently renewed,
that free market facilities be afforded in this city to both
producer and consumer. The Harbor Commission estab
lished such a market on a State wharf and carried out
the law in detail by the issue of permits to commission
men to do business on that wharf, corning into immediate
contact with the producer.
The Commissioner.^ have now acted, not upon any in
formation' publicly furnished by. any, producer,' but. upon
the complaint of a retail dealer that commission firms
holding the State permit refused to sell to him at the
market price or any price the produce required by him in
his business. It appears in his affidavit that he docs not
belong to the retail dealers' association and thaVhis ap
plication for membership therein was rejected and that
the wholesalers gave him to understand that he could
not have any goods because he was not a member of the
association which rejected him. .
In this information is developed the fact that there
exist a wholesale dealers' combination and a retail deal
ers' combination and that one is bound by agreement
only to sell to and to buy of the other. This^means that
no retail dealer can exist without the consent of these
two combinations and that any retailer who resorts to
the. free market to buy at first hands of the producer is
denied the right to buy anything of the wholesalers .and
is excluded from the retail dealers' combine.
There is no doubt that this inter-combination would
be held unlawful by the courts as in restraint of trade.
As long as it exists it entirely nullifies the purpose of the
free market as expressed by the Woodward law. .The
commission firms involved made a technical defense and
their permits were canceled by the Harbor Commis
sioners and the Chief Wharfinger was instructed not to
permit them to do business on any of the wharves,
docks or property of the State. This action vindicates
our confidence that the Harbor Commissioners would
enforce the law if given proof of its violation. It was
not fair to claim that they must assume the facts to. exist,
for their action under the law is judicial in its nature.
The firms aggrieved by it can now lay an action in the
courts which will test the law and determine the right of
the Harbor Commission to proceed under it. â¢ X
We desire the producers to note carefully the fore
jjoing statement and to consider that the proof was left
to be made by a retail dealer and not by a producer. An
incident of the trial was significant. An attorney ap
peared, claimed recognition and made this statement:
"I protest against the attempt to turn this place into a
courtroom.' 1 speak for the consumers, the people who
are being robbed every day by this produce combine. It
is not right to force any man to make a charge against
this combine. As soon as he does this he is boycotted
and loses his position. It is not for the small dealers to
prefer the charges. It is for you Commissioners.,! to.
act." . ' .. Â¦ - : 'Â¦''. "'Â¦.-Â¦. hÂ£?8&
This seems to us a preposterous proposition. Such a
combine as appears in the proof submitted works harm
tq two classes, the producers and the consumers. Inci
dentally a retail dealer suffers by a system that is in re
straint of trade. But in the end all restraint of trade
hurts only two classes, those who produce and those who
consume. Our contention was made and persisted in
in the interest of the producer, as removal of restraint
upon him brings supply and demand into natural rela
tions and relieves the consumer of artificial exaction.
No wrong in this world arising in commerce and trade
was ever righted except by the exertion and co-operation
of those who suffer from it. To say that it is not right
for the Harbor Commissioners to* ask any man to make
charges is to say that those who 6uffer the wrong must
suffer in silence and lift neither voice nor hand to help
the officers in setting them right! We. regret that such
a view is taken. To project it into jurisprudence would
mean that the remedies of tlie law are vain things, as to
invoke them it is necessary to prove that a. wrong has
been done. The author of the injury will not furnish
proof of it, for the law throws the burden of the proof
on -the sufferer, who must prove his injury.
Every effort so far made in this State to secure the
natural rights of the producer has cither failed or been
made difficult of accomplishment by the failure of the
sufferers themselves to give proof or information upon
which a remedy can be predicated. The Woodward-law
was a step largely into the unknown, taken in. the belief
that wrongs existed for which a remedy must be pro
vided. We now suggest that an earnest effort be made
to get the producer and consumer face to face in the
free market. If the decision of the Harbor Commission
stand it may be expected that the combine of the whole
sale and retail associations will be destroyed, and the ef
fect upon the producer and consumer will be awaited
with great interest' by both classes.

"The death last week of Er
nest Sevier, ; the well known at
torney of Eureka, Cal.." said
one of his San Francisco clients,
"reminds me of a story he told me
shortly before his death. 'Those boys
of mine,' he said, 'were always a fair
lot as boys go, but lately the rich at
mosphere of Humboldt County has
been too much for them. One of
their duties was to lead the old fam
ily cow daily to pasture. After the
novelty wore off there was a scarcity
of boys and the pastoral duty fre
quently fell upon me. Suddenly I no
ticed a change of heart and marveling
much, I went on a tour of investiga
tion the riext morning.
"Some distance from the house came
sounds of a suppressed' excitement
that was unfathomable, till coming
to a bend in the road, there burst on
my view a scene that would distance
the chariot race in "Ben Hur."
Mounted upon an old horse was one
of the boys, tearing along the road
like mad, while alongside was my
other hopeful proudly seated upon the
back of the family cow, likewise
charging along. In a race! We had
plenty of butter at home and needed
milk, so I immediately declared the
race off. The usual parental council
was quietly held in the woodshed, af
ter which I felt assured the cow
would be led to her feed â at least for
a few days â as walking gave promise
of being less exertion for the boys
than sitting on anything, especially a
cow.' "

locomotives ordered. The Washington
branch of the Baltimore and Ohio was
not opened until August, 1834. The
Ligotts Gap Railroad, which formed
the nucleus of the present Delaware,
Lackawanna and. Western system, was
chartered by tlie Pennsylvania Legis
lature in 1S32.
Samuel Sloan, at the age of 85. years,
is still chairman 'of the Lackawanna
directors. For thirty years ho was
president of this railroad, and he is the
oldest of tho conspicuous railway men
in service. His knowledge of railroad
ins extends back considerably more
than half a century. He can remember
the time when the Lackawanna man
agement "set about constructing a
model engine of great power for burn
ing anthracite coal." That was in 1853;
prior to which very little hard coal
bad been used for fuel. Mr. Sloan can
alpo remember the earjy days of the
Hudson River Railroad, for he helped
to build it, and after ,making it a suc
cess as its president he turned it over
to Commodore Vanderbilt, who devel
oped from It and the Harlem road the
great New Tork Central system.
From ruch small beginnings* the rail
roads of the United States developed
with gradually increasing rapidity un
til now railroading is the greatest of all
the mechanical industries. Between 1830
and 1S40 about 2S00 miles of railroad
were put in operation in this country.
In 1R50 there were 9021 miles of road,
and -from that time on the mileage mul
tiplied wonderfully fast. The Union Pa
cific Railroadâ the first line to the Pa
cific Coast â was. chartered in 1862, and
the Northern Pacific was chartered in
1864. The construction of these two
roads forms a picturesque chapter of
this country's history.
A railroad building fever took posses
sion of the country after the Civil
War. Capital came here freely from
abroad and new roads were started in
every direction. The sparsely settled
agricultural States offered substantial
inducements to railway corporations,
giving lands, county bounties and,
township aid. The Federal Government
also distributed its lands liberally in
order to stimulate the building of rail
roads. The year 1871 was a record
breaker in railroad construction, nearly
S000 miles being. added to the 52,000
miles which were in operation in 1870.
Overconstruction. caused a crash and
the panic of 1873 came, with its attend
ant reverses and bankruptcies. Since
then a very large proportion of the
railroads in this country havÂ£ passed
through the costly experience of insol
vency â¢ and reorganization, only . to
emerge! however, into an era of great
er magnitude and more far-reaching
prosperity than ever before known to
railroad men in any country.

principal of the Girls' High School, is
about to resign his position after many

licity was given to Brooks' prospective
resignation In The Call some weeks
ago, but at that time Brooks said he
had no immediate Intention of resign

It is said, however, that Brooks has
again confided to a few of his inti
mates that he will sever his connec

retire to his ranch in the -Santa Cruz
Mountains. Brooks, it, is said, is de
sirous that Mrs. Mary Prag, 'head of
history in the Girls' High School, suc
ceed to his position, Â£ut it is under
stood that his desire will not be ful
filled. School Director Mark, who
has one year more to serve, has his
eye on the place, which pays $250 a
month and has practically a life ten
ure.
It is on the cards for Mark to be
elected chairman of the Board of Edu

CAN "GO" NOW
Was Formerly Bobbed cf Her Energy !
by Coffee.
The wife of a Virginia clergyman
tells her coffee story thus: "One year
agt> I was a wreck, only abje to be up
Â¦ part of the time and dragging my-
self around the house.
"My skin looked like a dead hickory
leaf, no appetite, weight 112 pounds,
no energy and I suffered most of the {
time with most dreadful headaches or j
nciroua chills or spasms and could not |
bear *he least excitement. ''
"At one time my left hand was j
drawn to my shoulder and for nine I
<lÂ«ys could not be moved away and '
? had often laid for six to eight'weeks
u:ider the care of our best physicians.
I had been like this for six years and '
it seemed a cure could not be ef- !
fected ar.d I could get only temporary
relief. My case was pronounced ner-
vonsness, but that was as far as we
could get.
"All this time I had been a slave
to coffee, thought I could not live
without drinking three to five cups a
day, although my husband used to
beg me to give it up and give Postum
a trial. But I always put him off with,
â¢Oh, I don't think I'll like "it, it will
<lo me no good.'
"He was so persistent I finally de-
cided to try Postum, although I
thought the very idea of a good coffee
made from cereals waa absurd.
"At first I did not like It so very
well, but soon found it was not boiled
long enough to make it good; after a
few days the terrible headaches dis-
appeared and I felt bo full of energy
I was astonished. I grew to love Pos-
tum and have used it continually since
then and words can never express the
good it has done me.
"I never know what it is to have a
2iÂ«Â»adache, have not had a nervous at-
tack for eleven months, now weigh
142**, my complexion is clear and my
friends say I never looked so well. I
do not suffer a day'a sickness and can
do all my housework. JuÂ«t think that
for f!x years I spent more than half
-my time in bed, never able to keep up
more than a fev* daya at a time and
all that suffering: came from coffee.
"My restored health seems to me al-
most miraculous, but I know there Is
nothing miraculous about it. Just com-
mon sense from giving up coffee and
giving Postum a fair trial and I don't
hesitate to tell my. friends all about it
"I have a baby girl 2 years old, who,
for the past year, has used Postum in
her bottle instead of milk. She is a
large, healthy child, and If we give her
milk she will hand it back and cry
for Postunx. My husband also has
been greatly benefited by Postum and
nowadays we never have coffee in/bur
house, but you will always find plenty
of Postum In the pantry." Xame

Mich.

The men who are discussing the pos
sibility of . a show feel- assured- of; its
artistic success. Many people have in
vested in high class - horses in* recent
years, and would it Is thought.be glad
to show them., -
With the renewed interest in polo
comes a renewed interest, In the horse
generally. Already some men are talk
ing of the possibility of a horse show.
The memory of the disastrous show
held at Tanf oran three . years ago is
fading, and a show in Mechanics' Pa
vilion at some future, "day \ seems as
sured. The outdoor show's . at Burlin
game were always a success,' although
the entries were usually confined to
owners residing, in San Mateo County.
The. show was not held this y.ear.owing
to the absence of A.lmer New
haJl.|who was usually the moving spirit
in these affairs.
There Is a noticeable quickening of
interest in the horse at the Burlingame
Country Club in recent months, due
chiefly to the energy with which the
polo players have been preparing for
and have opened their season. :
Ponies are seen In every direction,
and yet the demand foe these animals
is so great it cannot be supplied. Soon
the foreign Â¦ players are due here, and
when they, arrive the struggles on the
field will take on an international air.
The play up. to the present "time has
been unusually fast. When the ponies
reach their best condition the standard
will be still higher. A match will be
played to-morrow on* Mr. Carolan's
field. r ***.Sf<i v

GREYHOUND HONORS
TO BE DETERMINED
IN THE CUP STAKE
SEEK TO REVIVE
FORMER GLORIES
OF HORSE SHOW
It is almost a certainty that Mac-
Gavin will win the California Club
event. He was not at his best last
Sunday, but still proved too strong
for Allen. The latter .hardly classes
with MacGavin. He is probably bet
ter able to give handicaps, but on
even terms MacGavin is a great deal
too~Trtrong for him. .
On the park courts Allen would
have a decided advantage and one
that might offset the superior skill
of MaeGavin. Allen is accustomed to
playing on the public courts, while his
opponent has played on them only
once or twice and is used to neither
the courts nor the surroundings.
It is expected all four classes will
be completed to-morrow. In the first
class sorne good matches are looked
forward to. In the upper half George
Baker, by beating R. N. Whitney last
Sunday, reached the semi-final round
and will meet the winner of the Mac-
Gavin-Routh match. It is a certain
ty Baker's opponent will be MacGav
in. as Routh'has no chance of win
ning. In the lower half Charles Dun
lap beat Clarence Griffin and thereby
gained a place in the semi-finals. He
will be opposed to the winner of the
Allen-Russell match. Allen is ex
pected to win his first match and
while it is expected Dunlap will make
him work, Allen shÂ»uld reach the fin
als. Many of the enthusiasts at the
park figure that George Baker has
more than an even chance of beating
JIacGavin. Unless MacGavin has an
off day he should win easily, as he
outclasses his opponent.
In the second class George Janes
etands the best chance of getting his
name engraved on the new cup. . He
has reached the finals and will play
the winner of the match between
Stewart Gayness and Norman Am
brose. Gayness is making his first ap
pearance in the second class, having
recently graduated from the third.
He can hardly hope to beat a player
of Ambrose's caliber. While * Am
brose has a good chance with Janes.
the latter will undoubtedly be favor
ite. Ambrose is steady, while Janes
is erratic. -X
In the third class two men who
have been unheard of heretofore will
meet in the finals. Brabant, a recent
arrival from New Zealand, where he
held the championship, will meet
Harold Gabriel. The latter is a
youngster w*ho received his tennis
education on the California Club
courts. He is a little short on expe
rience, but plays a clever game and
won all his matches thus far easily.
In the fourth class Skaggs and Gue
rin will contend 4 for final honors.
These two players have met many
times and the honors are about even.
Another reason for playing the
match in the morning instead of the
afternoon is to ailow Allen and Mac-
Gavin to compete in the class singles
tournament on the park courts. It
is= more than likely these two players
will meet in two final matches in one
day. In the park event they are
drawn in oppoaite halves and unless
the unexpected happens the loser of
the morning match will get a return
match in the afternoon.
Two tournaments \rtll be completed
to-morrow on the tennis courts. The
final match of the Tb.ank*sfvlng day
handicap singles vrill be played on the
California Club courts in the morn
ing. Darkness put a stop to play last
Sunday, when the score stood two
sets to one and 5-5 in MacGavin's fa
vor. MacGavin has a big lead on Al
len. The Jatter must win the fourth
set to even up matters.
The match is set for the morning,
as there is a possibility of its not tak
ing more than a few minutes for com
pletion. If MacGavin wins the first
two games played he gets the match.
If Allen wins the fourth set the fifth
will have to be played. In ' either
event the remainder of the match
should not tako more than half an
hour and possibly not more than five
minutes.

At the last meeting of the directors of
the California Yacht Club Harold L.
Martin, Charles E. Vogel and John J.
Sherry were appointed a committee to
nominate candidates for the offices of.
the club during the ensuing year:
The California Yacht Club is grow
ing, the following being elected recent
ly as members: Frederick D. Wells of
the United States army transport ser
vice, S. B. Conner, owner of the sloop
Pactolus, formerly owned and sailed
by Allen M. Clay; A. R. Conner,
Charles C. Gardner, M. G. Jories and
Charles E. Noyes.
. The Building Association of the Cal
ifornia Yacht Club has decided to erect
a clubhouse about 250 yards to the east
of the slip on the south side of the
Key Route pier.. As soon as the foun
dation piers are finished work will be
begun on, the building, which the direc
tors expect to have ready for : use on
opening day, 1904.
, The yachtsmen of the San Francis
co Bay and . those, of Oakland Creek
especially have for a long time been
much annoyed and damaged by 'the
petroleum refuse permitted to escape
into and befoul the waters in which
their pleasure cjaft are moored. Many
complaints have been .made to the
officials of railroad companies and the
owners of steam vessels that use oil
as fuel, but nothing more than prom
ises resulted. At last the directors of
the California Yacht Club seem to be
in a fair way to bring the offense of
fouling navigable waters home to the
perpetrators. The first officer of the
steamer Rosecrans, owned by the
Madsen Navigation Company, has
been charged with violation of the
State law by permitting refuse petro
leum to escape from the steamship
Into the navigable waters of San An
tonio estuary. He was placed under
arrest as the vessel was about to put
out to sea and was brought before
Justice Quion, Â¦n-ho'put him under a
bond of $500 to appear for trial when
the Rosecrans returns to this port, as
she is expected to do early during the
present month.
;â¢ August R. F; Brandes, chairman of
the resratta committee of the Califor
nia Yacht Club, leaves the Oakland En
quirer to-day arid proceeds to Wash
ington, D. C, having received a posi
tion in the United States printing of
fice. August Brandes has been a mem
ber of the California Yacht Club and
chairman of the regatta committee for
many years. He has also been a direc
tor of the club and of the Building As
sociation. In conjunction with A. C.
Lee, now vice commodore of the San
Francisco Yacht Club, he owned the
sloop Surprise, but for some time past
has been a member of the'erew of Com
modore George M. Shaw's yawl Idler.
He \ carries with him to the national
capital the best wishes of the yachts
men ojf San Frarici^D Bay. , He had
one or the narrowes^*escapes Â¦ from
drowning that has befallen any San
Francisco yachtsman. Returning one
day, single-handed In a small partly
open sloop to Oakland Creek he met
with a nasty sea.off Angel Island. The
boat shipped several waves and became
water-logged. Being too, heavily bal
lasted to float when full of water she
went down.* pulling the small boat
down with her. By good fortune a: life
buoy floated off from the deckhand
Brandes sustained himself on this for
an .hour; or- two -before being sighted
and picked up. '

The challenge of the Oakland Bowl-
Ing Club for a four-rink match, to be
played on the Oakland green Christ
mas day, was accepted. This will be
the third meeting of the. two clubs.
The first two were won by the local
bowlers. The Oaklanders made a good
showing on Thanksgiving day and
think they can win next time.
A question that called forth much
discussion 1 was that of the bias of the
bowls. It was not decided whether
bias No, 1, 2 or 3 be adopted
In tournament play. Most of the mem
bers were in favor of adopting the
standard bias of the big clubs in Scot
land. It Is doubtful if the players
could have the bowls changed in time
for the preliminary round of the new
tournament. The matter will prob
ably go over until the next meeting,
three months hence.
Some of the members were in favor
of having a doubles tournament In
stead \ of a singles. It was thought
that many of the players would not
be present when these matches were
called. In this case a man would be
defeated on account of the absence of
his partner and three players present
would be discommoded. A plan was
adopted whereby an entry list should
be posted at the clubhouse and those
who were desirous of playing would
enter their names and agree to play
their matches If possible. Partners
will be drawn by lot, as will be the op
ponents.
Scottish bowling Is the latest recrea
tion to seek a home in San Francisco.
This game was introduced about a
year ago by a few enthusiasts, who
had played It in the /"old country." In
the past year the /membership list of
San Francisco Scottish Bowling Club
has increased steadily and now con
tains ninety-two names. A small
space was set aside for rinks in the
park, but the green" is not nearly large
enough to accommodate the players
on Saturday afternoons. It is Impos
sible to extend the green in any di
rection but to the west and many dif
ficulties would be met in doing that.
It is probable a new green will be
turned over to the -fast growing club.
Fourteen new members were elected
on Thursday night. The club con
tains few young men, the membership
list containing the names of the most
influential men in the city. It Is not
a game that appeals particularly to
yoiing men. but is better suited to mid
dle-aged men, who are not able to
indulge in more violent forms of exer
cise.
While the game is as Scotch as base
ball is American, still many of the
club members are not "Scotch. . In
Scotland the interclub matches at
tract thousands of spectators and valu
able prizes are competed for. The only
place in the United States outside of
San Francisco and Oakland where
Scottish bowling is played is In New
Jersey. The San Francisco Club is
the largest of the three. The Oakland
Club has been in existence only about
two months, but already has a mem
bership of forty.
An enthusiastic meeting was held
Thursday night by the bowlers and
from 8 o'clock until 11 plans for the
future were discussed. A new singles
tournament was arranged, to begin to
day. The evenf will start at the con
clusion of the finals of the tournament,
which was started several months ago.
The contestants will be J. C. Moffatt
and James Gray.

10Supreme Court Officials Are Forced
to "Discontinue the Drinking
of Cooled Water.
Chief Justice Beatty issued a decree
yesterday that no more ice shall be
furnished to cool the drinking water
of the Supreme Court officials. This
decision is to the court attaches the
most interesting one handed down in
many months.
Major Washburn, Abe Johnson and
some of the Justices will experience a
considerable amount of inconvenience
as a result of the ruling. Frank Jor
dan, Oscar Tolle and a few others will
not be affected.
Most of the numerous attorneys who
visit the court have been in the habit
of assuaging their thirst at the water
! cooler in the clerk's office. Now. they
Â¦will have to take the elevator back to
the street to get rid of the dryness in
their throats. As a large proportion
of the local members of the legal fra
ternity have long ago declared indi
vidual boycotts on soda fountains, it Is
feared that the Chief Justice's decision
will make that $84 license look smaller
than ever.
The ice bill for the Supreme Court
has averaged about $4 a- month.
MURDERED BABY TOSSED .
INTO A MINE SHAFT
Butte Miners Make a Grewsome Dis
covery in a Well About to
Be Closed.
BUTTE, Mont., Dec. 4.â The body of
a recently born boy was found in the
bottom of a 150-foot shaft by two min
ers this afternoon. The sleeves of a
woman's waist were tied tightly about
the child's neck, showing that the lit
tle one had been strangled to death
before being thrown Into the shaft. The
boy was wrapped in a man's soft shirt
and a suit of woman's underwear. By
a singular coincidence the remains
were discovered ; several ' hours after
they had been cast away, as blood was
still* clotted on the corpse. Had the
perpetrators of the crime waited sev
eral hours the abandoned shaft would
have been closed by miners, with little
chance of the tragedy ever becoming
known. This was the first time the
shaft had been entered within a year
and the miners desired to see the bot

MYSTERY IS INVOLVED
IN SUIT FOB DAMAGES
Several Prominent Philadelphia Men
Axe Charged With Illegal
Practices.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 4 âSuit has
been entered against Colonel A. Loudon
Snowdon, president of the Falrmount
Park Commission; Charles A. Porter,
former State Senator; C. Kennedy
Crossan, a contractor, and the estates
of Ludwig S. Filbert, who died about
two months ago. They are accused of
having made illegal profits through the
promotion of the Danville Bessemer
Company, which was dissolved yester
day. The suit is brought to recover
about $325,000, but the case is shrouded
in mystery.
Madona Mystery Is Cleared.
NOVATO, Dec. 4.â The mystery sur
rounding the death of Gattardo Madona
has at last been cleared. From facts
brought to. light it is now conclusively
believed that -the unfortunate man
came to his death by his own negli
gence, and that the body was robbed
by tramps after Madona had been
killed by an engine of : the California
Northwestern Railroad Company; Ma
dona went to sleep upo.i the track and
the engine killed him while he slept.
The authorities have failed to appre
hend the tramps.
SACRAMENTO. Dec. 4â Al Wllcox was ar
rested in this city - to-day on a warrant from
Hiawatha, Kans., charging embezzlement. It
U charged that Wilcox sold a band of horses
for * another man, pocketed the proceeds and
came to California. \ .
Fortunately but few passengers were
on the car at the time of the accident.
Mrs. E. Bierwith, who lives at 208 Surry
street, was riding on the outside plat
form of the car and suffered severe in
juries. She was struck on the side of
the head by pieces of the broken gate.
The force of the collision threw the un
fortunate passenger from her seat and
she suffered a fracture of two of her
ribs. Mrs. Bierwith was rendered un
conscious by the Impact and was taken
to the residence of T. M. Deasy, 1403
Guerrero street. Dr. Marion Thrasher
attended her and found her suffering
from concussion of the brain as well as
fractured ribs. Mrs. Bierwith was re
moved to her home, and at a late hour
last night was resting easily. The other
passengers Jumped from the car before
it struck- Â¦
Motorman Longdale stayed by his
post and was severely cut by flying
glass and splinters. He says he is not
to blame for the collision. He claims
that the brake on his car was defective
and had been reported at the carhouse,
but for Borne unknown reason had not
been repaired. There is a slight grade
leading to the railway crossing, and
the car got beyond his control arid
crashed through the gates.
The front of the car was demolished
and had to be taken to the carshop for
repairs. Passengers on the train were
apprised of the accident by the blowing
of whistles and the sudden stopping of
the train.
One of the most thrilling: accidents
that has been reported in this city in
some weeks occurred yesterday. Car
No. 1033 of the Guerrero street line, in
t harge of Motorman W. W. Longdale
and Conductor, A- West, crashed
through the gates thrown across the
railroad track at Twenty-sixth and
Guerrero streets just as the last car of
a passenger train was passing. An in
etant sooner and the car would have
struck the train.

The judging for the poultry prizes
has been completed. Last night a few
special prizes were awarded, but still
the crowds did not desert the coops
and the royal birds came in for their
share of attention. "Dad" Moulton's
trick dogs won more applause by their
stunts and their popular owner was
kept busy for some time explaining
to the anxious ones the feats of his
talented pets.
DOG SHOW AWARDS.
The Judging for the best dog in the
show did not take place last night as
expected. This important ceremony
has been reserved for to-night, as the
crowning event of the show, and
much interest is being manifested by
all the owners. Three judges will be
required to decide and the votes of
two of them will be final.
The feature of the night's exhibi
tion was the Judging of the cats.
When the time for awarding the prizes
rolled around nearly the entire fem
inine portion of the assemblage flock
ed upstairs to attend the all important
ceremony. Great rivalry existed be
tween the owners of the high art fe
lines and they displayed no end of
anxiety and nervousness while the
test for honors was in progress.
John Riplinger's famous kennel of
English setters again furnished the
sensation of the evening, winning first
prizes in every class in which they
were shown. All day long as well as
during the evening session these dogs
were admired by the multitude, their
stand attracting the major part of the
spectators.
The fourth day of the animal show
opened yesterday morning with bright
prospects and ere the doors were
closed after the night's exhibit the
largest crowd that has ever attended
an event of the kind in this city had
passed through the doors of Mechan
ics' Pavilion. The usual interest and
enthusiasm prevailed throughout: the
day and evening and a large number
of prize cats and dogs received re
wards.

Sportsmen Bemoan the Poor
Shooting Afforded on the
Marshes for Weeks Past
Birds Reported in Great
Numbers on Yolo Bottoms
and Near, Santa Barbara
Somewhere within the borders of this
broad State there are millions of ducks
fattening themselves, on the wild feed
which winter rains have started -grow-'
Ing. x . / :. Â¦ " ,.. â¢ , . I Â¦:;Â¦'
Some fortunate farmers', boys are
probably enjoying such shooting as
rarely falls to any man. In /the "mean
time the city sportsmen 1 are disconso
late, as their heavily baited, ponds' on
the Suisun, Sonoma and' Alameda
marshes have harbored >but few ducks
for several weeks past Some well
known preserves have yielded five and
even less birds to the gun where, in the
earlier part of the season, limit-bags
were, the rule.
The birds are reported .in immense
numbers in Santa Barbara County and
on the overflowed lands of Yalo Coun
ty, especially in the vicinity of Knights
Landing. A heavy frost which would
cause the, water to freeze, would quick-'
ly drive the birds to the waters of the
sloughs, which would mean a scatter
ing of tljem . over a wider area.
The dry, cold weather of the present
woek has brought some birds back to
the lower Alameda marshes and better
sport is expected to-morrow than has
been obtained for several weeks. This
may hold good of all the preserves.
The, various clubs keep a record of
the birds killed on their preserves. The
results this year fall far short of pre
vious years.
The Field and Tule Club j members
hope for good shooting to-morrow,
when a number of members will 'be on
their Suisun preserve. Those'who have
signified their intention of going are:
M. E. Unger, HE. L. Miller, H. B. Hos
mer, L. W. Harpham, A. M. Shields,
Dr. A. T. Derby, W. Bay, Colonel Mc-
Mahon,' A. M. Cumming, J. B. Coleman
and F. T. Hayes.
The hot weather last Sunday had a
depressing effect on the shooting at the
Monterey preserve of the Empire Gun
Club. Eight members were down. The
best bag was twenty-eight ducks be
tween two men. . The members wha
shot were: Con Roman, Dr. George G.
Gere, F. L/ Haupt, Dr. A. J. Sylvester,
Walter F. Wood, Bert Patrick, H. G.
F. Schumacher, F. B. Surryhne and
Messrs. Mitchell and Davidson, guests.
The ' members who go down to-day
will entertain B. A. Worthlngton, John
M. Kilgarif and Captain Cantwell.

ploy of Jimmy Coffey, met with a
serious and possibly fatal accident at
the track, yesterday morning. . The
two-year-old broke away at the six

NOTES, OF THE TRACK
The poor' bookies were again caught
out of line, Â¦ suffering severe losses.
While Honiton and Miss Betty were the
only public' choices to land, Prestolus,
Redwald, Aunt Polly arid Dr. Bernays
all had many admirers, which served
to knock a 1 big hole In the box office"
receipts. '-,-j \
MABTIN OUTFINISHES KUNZ.
Jack Martin on Prestolus, the second
choice, outflnished Kunz astride Blessed
Damozel, at the finish of the opening
mile event, or the' first choice would
have scored. As it was, Prestolus only
earned the verdict by the shortest of
heads. Achilles ran third.
Garnet Ferguson's fllly Miss, Betty, a
7 to 5 favorite, took the five and a half
furlong two-year-old scramble from a
big field. She ran, out on > the, turns,
which cost her; several .lengths, and
was ridden out to/beat Effervescence, a
12 to 1 shot. Barney Schreiber's Wini

the milet selling event. . Bill Waldo
had the. mount and let the favorite
fall so far out of it going the first
quarter that It could be seen his case
was a hopeless one. , Redwald, with
J. Booker up, .and 3% toi 1, made a
runaway race of it, winning clear of
all incumbrancesv The" first choice did
move alone in time to down Constable
for the -place. -' Â¦ â¢

Puss in Boots out half a length. : The
favorite, *â¢ Rey Dare, j naturally a ] slow
beginner?: had to tramp^, the overland
route, but was going strongly the: last
part and over a longer route would
probably have won.
Almost any one of the eight start
ers in the final mile and a furlong
Vun looked to have a chance, and it
proved an open betting affair. Chub,
at'3% to 1, finally went to the barrier
a mild choice over Position and Illo

rode a well judged. race on Dr. Ber
nays and in a furious drive his mount
was awarded a nose decision over Ca

ran a fair third. t
\ The sensation of thd race . was ; fur-'

SACRAMENTO, Dec. 4. â Jacob Car
lock, a stage driver, who had sold out
his business in Redding: and was on his
way to join his family at Fresno, fell
in with bunko men this morning: and
experience cost him $260. Carlock
stepped out of his hotel this morning',
and, looking around for the postofflce,
was accosted by a man who kindly of
fered to show him the way. The man
accompanied him into the office and
suggested they take a walk around
Capitol Park. On the way the man
regaled Carlock with a story of how
he was bunkoed out of $20 last night
and Carlock said It served him right,
adding it would be a long time before
he should be such a "greeny." Ar
rived at ths Capitol grounds they met
a friend of Carlock's guide, who pro
posed ' that they "match" for the
cigars. The guide lost. and when ha
started downtown for the cigars the
stranger proposed to Carlock they
keep up the sport for money. Car
lock had put up and lost $260. when
a man who represented himself as a
policeman, but who was a confederate
of the other two swindlers, threatened
thenvwlth arrest for gambling on the
Capitol grounds. Carlock's new-found
friend told him to wait for them at
the hotel while they squared matters
with the police, and he has not seen
any one of them nor his money since.

nearing completion very fast. It Is ex
pected it will te ready for use the latter
part of January. It is a fine building
and a most valuable adjunct to the fine
quarters of the post. Besides the gym
nasium proper, there Is to be a bowlins
alley, coffee and lunch room, reading
room and baths. It will cost 5W.0G0
when complete.
The original Casual Camp No. 1 pre
sents a very different appearance to
day from what it did during the period
of the Spanish-American war. Then
It was a rough hillside which sloped
down into a steep ravine. Now all
this Is "being changed; a big gang of
men. horses, plows and dump carts are
leveling the place. They have prac
tically removed a small hill, and used
up the dirt to fill up the gulch. When
finished it will greatly add to that part
of the post, and make a magnificent
site for a fine building. Down at the
gun wharf a new torpedo station and
torpedo cable station are being put In.
On the beach two more storehouses are
in course of construction. They will be
300 feet long by fifty feet wide.
PAVIXION NEABLY COMPLETED.
The new operation pavilion will soon
be ready for occupancy and will be a
powerful adjunct to the general hos
pital. The arrangements are said to be
complete in every detail. During his
present trip to the East Major Kendall
will look Into the purchasing of the
newest and latest surgical appliances to
be used In connection with the furnish
ing of the new building. The Govern
ment appropriated $25,000 for the con
struction of the pavilion.
The Presidio presented a very ani
mated appearance yesterday after
noon. The beautiful weather coupled
with the fact that the weekly band
concert was on sufficed to attract a
great many people from* town, who
went out In snappy automobiles and
swell traps and lined up in the vicin
ity of the clubhouse, in front of which
the band was stationed.
The post people were also evident
In large numbers, and the bright uni
forms of the officers added to the pic
turesqueness of the scene. These Fri

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Dec 4. â The *entlment wu
again extremely bullish in wheat to-day and
trading was on a liberal scale. Fears of dam
age to the winter wheat through lack of mois
ture were quite - general among traders before
the session opened and on initial sales May
was unchanged to %c higher at 81c. 81%Â©
81?4c There waa a good general demand at
the start and with only email offerings the
price quickly, advanced to 82%c. then a slight
reaction occurred. The decline was due to
selling by put traders, who had reason to be
lieve that the big long was disposing of part
of bis holdings. Selling on the part of the
St. Louis houses aided in the setback. At the
decline, however, there ireo buying by com
mission houses and ehorts, and the market
was again strong. A better tone in late cables
and the bullish Ohio crop report stimulated
buying during â¢ the latter part of the season
and the close was strong, y Final figures on
May were 82%c, after the price had touched
82%c. .. * .
There was a further advance in the price of
corn due largely to sympathy with wheat and
a general spread of the bullish sentiment
After opening %@%c higher at 43c to Site
Â«i y^?l? betweea 43c and Â«%c. closing at
Oats were active and atrong, influenced
largely by the action of wheat and corn. May
opened a shade to %e to higher at 86%o to
S6%c, ranged between 36% @36?4c and Sfl%c
closing at 36%Â®36%c. - * '
Provisions were easier early in the day due
to liberal receipts of hogs and lower price* at
the yards. Later the market firmed up under
a good demand credited to . shorts. The
strength in grains lent some support to hoir
products. Closing prices were steady with Jan
uary pork 5c up at $11 05. , January . lard was
unchanged at $0 45 and ribs were 5c higher
The leading futures ranged as follows:

gentine, cables said that all districts reported
a material advance in the condition of the
crop. The monthly statement of European
stocks of Wheat and Flour, afloat and ashore,
gave a total of 9,360,000 quarters, against 8,
002,000 quarters last year. Bradstreet's gave
the week's exports of Wheat and Flour from
the United States at 4,201,000 bushels, against
6.504,000 last year. '
Chicago advanced %c and the market was
strong on the condition of 1 the Ohio crop,
which was 73. against 91 a year ago. The
crowd was bullish and long, with speculative
activity increasing. .\ .

moved slowly. River Burbanks were abundant
and quiet, but were firmly held on reports of
heavy purchasing: In the growing districts on
speculative account. Most dealers were . of
the' opinion that â¢ the heavy purchasing and
storing by tho speculative interest would have
a tendency to lessen the receipts in this mar
ket, hence the firm feeling. Another car of
Sweet Potatoes arrived from Merced -and was
quickly disposed of at the previously quoted
price. Onions were plentiful and easy at un

NEW YORK STOCK LIST. .
NEW YORK, Dec. 4. â The net chanres in
clocks from last nlcht's prices shown by to
day's lart prices give no eort of indication
of the excitement and hurly-burly of the day's
market. The eaimated advance of the early
part of the day was freely fed by enormous
realizing which ultimately wiped out practi
cally all the early ealn. The mere fact of
the insignificant prise changes on such a vol
ume of business i.'.ims indubitably to the
larre wllin* to Vealize which waa effected.
Th* fact that there was practically no news
to account for the movement waa confirma
tory of Its professional character. Yesterday's
Bharp .upward movement, succeeding the grad
ual growth during the week of the advance,
did brinr in some slight buying from out
side houses, but buj-ing to cover shorts was
the most .important element in the movement.
The bear fright extended into foreign markets
end the large buying of United States Steel
was supposed to be largely due to the un
covered Fbort interest in that stock existing
abroad. The retreat of the bear Interest which
began yesterday became a rout to-day. Many
of tie etocks which have already enjoyed
tonii measure of recovery from the depth of
depression were notably outside of to-day's
ir.overaerit. The Western and Pacific stocks
were not separate sharers in the activity and
the strength and the Southwestern and South
ern stocks concerned in the cotton movement
ehowed positive depression. The total deal
lrgs rose above a million chare* and this
enormous business wan largely congested In
United States Ste*l Dreferred and in Brook
lyn Transit and Pennsylvania. The shorts in
United States Steel preferred believed that
the buying in that stock was for account of
the managers of the recent bond conversion
syndicate. The known means of information
of inside affairs of the corporations posaessed
by this syndicate was tmfficlent to make this
determined absorption of the stock terrifying
I? the bears. No epeciflc news develooed to
account for the movement, which reached an
extreme cf S\ t . The stock's net rain was 2.
The volume of dealing* in Pennsylvania was
also â¢nonnous throughout the day, but the
prio* movement waa narrow. The extreme
rise vu % and the stock cloÂ»Â»d %o. higher
thaa laat n!rbt- The taking of profits here
waa Terr ob-imi.
The buyinrV of stock* for London account
belped to weaken the exchange market and
both discount and the price of gold were low
er in trade, but the money rate ran off in
this market so that no gold vu taken in
London for New York. Preliminary estimates
Indicate that the recelDta of currency from
the Interior on the direct express movement
reached something leas than $3,000,000. A*
the Bub-treasury operations have withdrawn
from the banks 83,049.000, it is expected that
the cash item will ehow a decrease of a few
hundred thousand. The action of to-day's
money market inClcate* a coed bank state

NEW YORK, Deo. 4,â The following table.
NEW YORK, Dec. "4.â The cotton market
opened firm' at an advance' of -6(521 points
following cables that were even â¢ better than
expected. Indicating apparently that the Eng
lish trade was inclined to put quite as bullish
an interpretation on the Government report
as did the local operators yesterday, and it
seemed that locally popular sentiment took no
less bullish a view of the situation as a re
sult .of further consideration. During the
progress of the market it was reported that
the local bull leader was feeding out his hold-
Ings to certain Wall street shorts around 12.60c
for ! March and that he turned a buyer on
even* trilling break, but when prices had
reached the high level mentioned reports of
a private settlement were recorded, and with
the trading feeling that the short interests had
perhaps been pretty well eliminated the tone
became slightly easier and the realizing
heavier, so that during the balance of the
session the market . showed a somewhat sag
ging tendency, though there was another spurt
of a point or two at the close, with the
market finally steady, net one point higher
on April, hut January was four to eight points
higher. Sales were estimated at 1,200,000 bale*.

All descriptions under this head were In
ample supply and the market waa dull, as
local trade was quiet, as usual on Friday,
and there was very little Inquiry from outside
points. There waa Â» limited demand for
choice Grapes for shipment on the Portland
steamer, and fancy offerings sold for that pur
pose at 75@85o per crate. The local demand
for both small and large packages was light,
and the limited supplies were more than suf
ficient for requirements. Thfere was contlnuel
dullness In Apples, which continued to arrive
freely from all sections, and several dealers
were shading prices In order to effect sales.
Winter Nellls Pears were in fair request and
prices were firmer for strictly fancy lots. The
usual quantity of Berries came in and sold
elowly at lower prices. Oranges continued to
arrive freely and as the demand was slack,
prices were lower. Some dealers were still
asking $2 75 per box for Navels, but sales at
that figure were rare, and In fact It was dif
ficult to obtain $2 60 for the general run of
offerings. Lemons, Grape Fruit and Limes
were unchanged. Ripe Bananas continued
firm and active, with supplies limited. The
market was still bare of Central American, but
several cars -were reported close at hand and
due at any time.

As Postman George White was
wending his way along the San Bru
no road yesterday morning he was
startled to see the body of a man hang
ing from the limb of a tree in a little
wooded, clump on the Robinson ranch.
White hastily cut the still warm body
down and at once notified Acting Coro
ner Cunningham of San Mateo County.
The remains were Identified some
hours later by George Duncan as
those of Matthew Rourke, a former
inmate of the Almshouse.
Despondency drove the unfortunate
man to suicide. He was penniless and
without friends, with no prospects of
bettering his condition, so he chose
suicide as the only resort to rid him
self of his misery.
No one In the vicinity of Colma or
San Bruno knew the man. He was
not seen by any one in that section of
the country and had probably wan
dered there with the intention of end
ing his existence. Nothing was found
in his pockets as to his identity save
a scrap of paper on which was written
the name and address of Charles Dun
can, 637 Linden avenue.
Duncan was formerly engineer at
the Almshouse and he Identified the
dead man by his general description.
Duncan states that Rourke was an in
mate of the place for some time and
was given a position as assistant en
gineer at a salary of $10 a month.
Several months ago Rourke fell
asleep while on watch and was dis
charged from his position. Soon af
ter that he left the Almshouse and
since then Duncan heard nothing of
him. Duncan states that Rourke was
for many years an engineer and was
considered a first-class man in his
day.
He often spoke of a woman friend,
who lived on Guerrero street, but
never mentioned her name. Rourke
was a native of Ireland and about 65
years of age. He was attired in a dark
gray suit, soft black hat and "heavy
shoes. The remains were sent to thÂ«
Morgue at Redwood City.
G. F. Lofgren, a laborer, lately em
ployed at the Union Iron Works, com
mitted suicide yesterday morning in his
lodgings, 771 Bryant street, by shooting
himself through the ..head with a re
volver. He had been obliged to quit
work several weeks ago because of an
accident resulting in the breaking vt.
his right hip, since which time he had
been despondent. His despondency was
increased by over-indulgence in alco
holic stimulants and by the fact that
he was in love with Mrs.. Clara Peter
son, n pretty widow residing at 217
Langton street. She had taken an in
terest in him and had visited him sev
era! times at the hospital, but when he
took to-drink she would- not have any
thing further to do with him.
He left a note stating that he had
broken his hip in an accident and had
been discharged without cause. The
note concludes: "At present I cannot
get anything to do because I am not
well yet, and as I cannot be a thief or
a beggar I am doomed to die of starva
tion; so I prefer a bullet. 1 * He also left
a brief note of farewell in Swedish ad
dressed to Mrs. Peterson.
Lofgren was a native of Sweden, 33
years old.
The announcement that the old bark Tidal
Wave ha<3 bÂ«*en turned over to a firm of wreck
em tn be converted into junk was received
with r:eat interest by the older member* of
the local shipping community. The Tidal
Wave is the last of a once ramous fleet of
windjammer* and during her thirty-four years
ot *ervio<? ha* earned more than en->u?h money
to pay for a duplication of herself wrought in
irold. Built in 1SI33 the Tidal Wave was one
of the crack lumber coasters in 1f>"2, a year
of big freights. Th* highest lumber charter
of that year and probably the hlRheei on
recrr>i was $37 50 per thousand lect from
Pupet Pound to CaJSao. In tho*Â»e days tne
Tidal Wave's smart heels made her tarticu
lariy valuable. She haÂ» gone from hfre to
Port Madison in five days and baa made the
round trip, coming down heavily l.iJen with
products of the Washing-ton forests. In twenty
five day* A list of the names of the coaster*
best known in 1S72 tells to those fannli:ir with

Mr. Hodson, one of the principal owners
of the mine, ordered that it should be
shut down. The Prospect also says
that Mr. Van Ee had expressed an in
tention to shut down when he con
ferred with Sheriff Graves. The fol
lowing general' statement is also made
by the Prospect: *'â¢
"It appears that a union was formed
of the miners working in the Wilbur-
Womble and the Royal, and Mr. Van
Ee anticipated the demands that were
likely to be made. He announced to
Mr. Graves that he would not allow the
union to run his mine, and . that he
should close down all of the extensive
works till the question was finally set
tled. This lockout will throw about 160
men out of employment. The water
will probably be kept out of . the mine,
if the engineers are not molested. Mr.
Hodson 'has arrived af Hodson, and by
his orders the mine is closed except a
few men to keep the water , out and
prevent deterioration [ of the property.
Notice has been served on the men oc
cupying thfe -company's houses to va

that the j union be "recognized and that
the men be" allowed to board and trade

'"Up to the present time the men

Many mines in this State are adding
quite largely to their facilities for
turning out ores and working them
economically and- expeditiously. This
is taken to be a gooÂ£ sign by all con
cerned as indicating confidence In the
worth of the properties. The im
provements are noted in nearly all
the mining counties. The Nevada
City Transcript says that the present
Improvements at the Murchie Consol
idated mines will be completed in
about thirty das's. Three mills will
be installed, having three stamps
each. Seventy-flve tons of ore, it is
said, can be milled daily. Power will

If all the mine owners who have prom
ised to send specimens keep that prom

Shasta County will be well advertised

of specimen ore from Shasta County,
and this exhibit will be placed in an
important place In the State's exhibit, as
Shasta leads the counties la mineral

There will be at least six tons of cop

The Placerville Nugget describes the
improvement in the slate industry of
El Dorado County that has been effect
ed during one year. The most striking
development is the construction of a
cable line for-movlng the slate from
the quarry to 'the railroad. The Nug
get says that the cable will be a large
means for development. Heretofore
the slate has been teamed to the rail
road at a cost of about 75 cents per
square. The cable will reduce this
cost to 6 cents or 7 cents a square. The
Nugget says: Â¦
The new cable Is supported by nineteen
wooden-frame towers and crosses, the river at
an elevation of 500 feet with a, span of 2400 feet.
The cable is operated from the thirteen-foot
water-wheel at the quarry power-house, and
requires six horsepower empty and about twenty
horsepower with the loaded buckets on The
capacity of the wheel Is about sixty horsepower.
Eight modern cottage?, a new office building
and several new roads are part of the Improve
ments â¢ made. In addition an air com
pressor, electric lighting plant and 7000 feet of
power pipe have been built. In the pit the ex
cavation Is now eighty feet in depth and an
acre or more in area. A tunnel has recently
been driven 1000 feet, opening Into the bottom
of the pit. This will drain the quarry and ob
viate the . necessity of pumping and -will pre
vent the pit filling up. A large amount of de
velopment work is now under way. The quarry
'will be extended north and west, and after the
necessary stripping off of the top earth is don*
the area of exposed slat* will be quadrupled.
Concerning the late discovery of tin
in Alaska, a special correspondent of
the Mining and Scientific Press, writes:
"In July, 1903, a party of prospectors
set out from the town of Teller on Port
Clarence to cross overland to the north
side of the Seward peninsula. They
followed up Lost River, which empties
into Port Clarence, twenty miles west
of Teller, and had gone only five miles
from. the coast when they discovered
and located a'tin ledge, which at pres
ent promises to. be the mo3t important
mineral discovery yet made In Alaska.
The ledge Is described as a granite dike
100 feet wide, cutting through the low
er Silurian limestone (called in the
United States geological reports of the
region the Port Clarence limestone),
which forms the surface of all that sec
tion of the peninsula and attains a
thickness of 2000 feet. The ledge has
been stripped the whdle width and is
found to carry good values in tin
throughout, while some of it is said to
be- rich. Â¦ Tin has been found In North
Carolina, South Dakota and California,
but not yet developed in Important
quantities, and the Government reports
show that no commercial tin was pro
duced in this country in 1902. This dis
covery promises to change the story
soon, as the deposit is close to the
coast and cheap transportation by boat
can be had. The character of the ore
and the extent of the ledge are not un
certain, for they have been Investigated
by Arthur ttolller, who announced the
tin discovery to be bona fide."
THE SLATE INDUSTRY.
the Los Angeles Herald. The dally ca
pacity of the Coallnga field is reported
to.be about 12,000 barrels, or about^one
fourth of the production of the Kern
River district. The output of the Kern
River field is estimated at something
like 16,000,000 barrels for 1903.
The Bakersfield Californian also
makes some figures concerning oil pro
duction the present year and says:
"As showing the enormous extent of
the oil industry in Kern County it is
estimated by well informed oil men
that the production of the Kern River
field has Increased about 25 per cent
during the present year, and that for
1903 it will exceed 16,000,000 barrels. Of
this amount it may, be said, as a con
servative estimate, that the Associated
controls 60 per cent of the output. The
Southern Pacific and the Standard are
the heaviest purchasers, and as the for
mer now is virtually in control of the
Associated, it is easy to see what an
interest it has in the district. As there
is perfect accord between the railroad
people and the Standard, the two* may
be said to dictate the situation.. The
production at McKittrick is estimated
at something over 2,000,000 barrels,
which Is also about 25 per cent increase.
The same conditions prevail at this
field as at Kern River to a great ex
tent, the railroad company taking a
large proportion of the product. The
production of Coalinga has been rough
ly estimated at something over 2,000,000
barrels. From this it may be seen that
the Fresno County field is still "far be
hind the Kern County fields."

Investigation into the charges of mal
feasance and misconduct in the County
Clerk's office will be made by the Grand
Jury. Before the session of that body
ended yesterday District Attorney By
ington brought certain' charges against
Mahony to the attention of the jurors
and Thursday, evening of next week
was. set for witnesses to give testi
mony regarding < their knowledge of
questionable transactions. Expert re
ports on the financial condition of the
office will be presented, and the inves
tigation will be sweeping to the extent
that it may involve the Public Adminis
trator. -The latter's connection with the
probate department of the' County
Clerk's office will be Inquired into at
the regular meeting next -Friday after
noon. Â¦
County Clerk Mahony will be sum
moned to appear and make explana
tions, first on the charge of having
hypothecated his salary warrant for No
vember to five different money brokers.
Harry B. Barbee, who until recently
served as Deputy County Clerk, will In
all likelihood be the most important
witness against his former employer,
and the money lenders will produce
their records. After this branch of the
scandal is sifted the jury will proceed
with further inquiry and take the evi
dence of witnesses, whom it may be
necessary to subpoena. The ' firms to
whom Mahony is alleged to have
hypothecated . his November warrant
are: The Pacific Investment and Loan
Company, I. Franklin & Co., Hawley &
Hottage, Bier & Rogensburger and R.
B/Aronsohn. District Attorney Bying
ton says that if it be shown that sal
ary, demands have been issued for work
not actually performed the County
Clerk may be indicted for the issuance
of fraudulent warrants.
In connection with this matter Audi
tor Baehr Baid yesterday that he will
not audit Mahony's demand for No
vember until the five brokers to whom
he hypothecated hi* salary for the same
month agree among themselves who
shall receive . the money. Baehr was
not in his office when Mahony's de
mand was "held up" by Deputy Wilkin
son pn the protest of the five money
lenders, but he approves of his subor
dinate's course. The fact that a half
dozen money brokers were hot on the
trail of Mahony for having hypothe
cated his warrant to each of them was
made public when the expose of his
juggling with the salaries of his depu
ties was made. The Auditor, however,
could take no" action until the request
was made for the warrant, when pro
tests were registered by the brokers.
Aside from the Mahony matter little
of Importance d 'was transacted at the
meeting of the Grand Jury yesterday
afternoon. On complaint of one of the
jurymen Herbert Schmltz and Marsden
Manson of the Board of Public Works
were called to explain the dusty condi
