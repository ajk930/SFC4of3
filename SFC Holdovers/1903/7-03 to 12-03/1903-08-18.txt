CHICAGO, Aug. 17.â A cure for lockjaw
has at last been discovered. The cure 13
not a theoretical one. % It has been tested
and proved. The discoverer is Dr. Samuel
A. Mathews. professor of pharmacology
In the University of Chicago.
Mathews' treatment of the dread disease
consists of an intravenous injection of
salt solution. The treatment has just
been tried 'for the first time on George
Newman, the 11-year-old son of J. M.
Newman of South Chicago.
The patient had. an acute attack of the
malady and was in the last stages when
Dr. Mathews was asked to try his newly
discovered remedy. As a result the spec
ter of death has vanished and Georga
Newman is able to sit up in bed.
.The logic of Mathews' discovery is sim
ply this: The function of the kidneys Is to
carry away from the body all things that
tend to poison the blood. The poison
which causes lockjaw is produced by the
tetanus bacillus, a motile germ which
forms in wounds. This poison, in cases
of lockjaw, paralyzes the kidneys to such
an extent that they are unable to per
form their functions and carry it out of
the system.
Mathews found from experiments with
rabbits, the blocd of which had been pois
oned with tetanus bacillus or with mor
phine, that a solution of salt, when In
jected into their blood, greatly stimulated
the uctlon of the kidneys.
On Wednesday. July 13. while playing
near bis home, George Newman caught
the large toe of his right foot between the
chain and cog wheel of a bicycle and that
member was mangled. Dr. Hartman of
South Chicago was summoned, dressed
the toe and It began to heal nicely. Eleven
days later, however, symptoms of lockjaw
appeared, and from that time the child
grew, steadily worse.
Last Tuesday the attending doctors told
the anxious parents that ' they could do
no more: that death was a question of a
very short time. One of the ddctors told
the elder Newman of Professor Mathewa
and his experiments. Mathews was sum
moned. When he arrived George had been

disease, for five hours. Mathews had lit

No one knows better the political situa
tion within the Grand Army, in so far
as the new commander In chief is con
cerned, than General Stewart and that
his chief of staff should bo emphatically
express himself may be regarded as very
significant v _-
At the headquarters of the Illinois del
egation, where the stanchest of General
Black's supporters are to be found, it
was given out among the. delegates last
night by Department Commander
Partridge that there would be no
opposition to General Black at , the
convention, and that possibly the
convention' would, in accordance* with
an old custom and a privilege.?' it' enjoys
under the by-laws, vote to have the vic
torious ballot cast by the adjutant gen-
BLACK'S SUPPORTERS.
With Bulkeley out of the running the
contest narrowed down to the prominence
of Black as a candidate and to a ques
tion as to whether the friends of General
Miles would endeavor to induce him to
permit bis name to be used. While the
speculation was rife, however, the an
nouncement was made on the authority
of General J. Corey Winans, chief of staff
to General Stewart, that General Miles
would not be nominated, but would be
one of those to second the nomination
of General Black. -.'Â£Â¦?
"I have Just come from General Black's
rooms," said the officer, "and it Is as
certain as the coming day that General
Miles is prepared to support the first
named. He is an' old friend of Black,
fully appreciates the popularity of the
Illinois man and knows too well that
his own strength, even should his friends
decide to put his name forward, is not
sufficient to assure him a victory.
"You can mention General Miles as
among those who .are anxious to second
the nomination of Black and he would
gladly accept the opportunity to put his
old friend in nomination himself. He h'ks
never announced his candidacy for the
commander In chief of the Grand Army
and if it had not been for several news
papers which, for reasons best known to
themselves, brought, him suddenly, to. the
fore as a possible candidate, bis name
would not have been considered hi con
nection with the high position at this en
campment. In the future 'General Miles
may possibly be placed In command of
the Grand Army. In fact I have learned
that a number of States are already
planning such a move"." 'Â¦-'â¢ -"Â¦-
ONLY ONE CANDIDATE.
"Weeks before the pilgrimage of the old
soldiers to the coast began General Black
had received a pledge of support" from
thirteen States, among them being Ala
bama, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Louisiana. Mississippi, Michigan, Minne
sota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Since his
arrival here other States have been send
ing to his headquarters their assurance
of loyalty until enough were pledged to
guarantee the stalwart old warrior an
election against any and all opposition.
Last evening it was announced that the
candidacy of Morgan G. Bulkcley, de
partment commander of Connecticut, had
not developed farther than a boomlet,
which had its origin in the delegation
from the Nutmeg State about a month
ago. Early in the day it was reported
that it was the" plan of the delegation to
place Bulkeley in nomination with the
idea of making him a possibility in the
future, but at the headquarters of the
delegation last evening it was authori
tatively stated that Commander Bulkeley
had no intention of allowing his name to
go before the convention, but would Join

are the flags that were carried during

It was through his courtesy that the de

\^^^ the stage in Steinway
Hall last evening and
beneath the familiar words was a splen
did likeness of General George H.
Thomas, after whom the local post takes
its name. The reception tendered by the
post last evening was largely attended.
Had the hall been twice its size it could
not have accomodated the crowds which
poured through the doors. Every seat
was taken and many had -to stand. The
decorations were beautiful and called
forth much favorable comment. Potted
plants, ferns, cut flowers and pafms in
termingled with the national colors and
American flags covered the walls and hid
the stage. Vari-colored lights illuminated
the 'hall and the scene was an animated
one.
A special committee composed of Com
mander A. D. Cutler and comrades Ben
jamin Heath Jr., W. A. Jacobs and Wil
liam Healy had the affair in charge.
Refreshments were served and the Sev.
enth United States Infantry band dis
coursed patriotic music throughout the
evening. " " * "
At 8 o'clock a reception was tendered
to th# ladies. Mrs. A. D. Cutler, wife
of the commander of the post, and the
wives and daughters of the members of
the organization received the visitors.
The evening's programme opened with
a patriotic selection by the band. At its
conclusion. Commander Cutler formally
welcomed the visitors. He expressed his
gratification at the assured success of
the encampment and he invited the visit
ing comrades to make the headquarters
of the post their abiding place during
their stay in this city. He said the doors
of Stelnway Hall would always be open
to visiting comrades and the hand of
good fellowship would always be ex
tended to the men who defended their
country's cause during the dark days of
1S61 and 1S63.
The Knickerbocker Quartet, composed
of Herbert Williams. Dr. R. W. Smith. D.
B. Crane and L. A. Larsen. sang familiar
songs. The rendition of the old songs,
which were heard in the still nights
round the campflres in war time, aroused
memories and touched the hearts of the
veterans.
SONGS PLEASE VETERANS.
The quartet might have sung all night
if the applause was an incentive, but a
lengthy programme prevented It.
Miss Lillian Quinn scored a hit with
stirring recitations. She struck a keynote
in the hearts of her listeners by the fer
vor of her declamation. Her voice rang
through the hall with great effect, and
when she concluded she was greeted with,
a generous burst of applause.
Mrs. J. E. Birmingham's splendid con
tralto voice was heard to good effect and
flhe was repeatedly encored.
J. W. Erwin presented a serfes of ster
eoptlcon views of San v Francisco" and
gave an interesting account of the vari
ous spots portrayed on the canvas. The
visitors were delighted with the scenes
and even old residents, long familiar with
them, saw new beauty in them.
Miss Helen Colburn Heath rendered a
soprano solo and her singing was greatly
appreciated by the large audience. The
Knickerbocker Quartet and Mrs. Birm
ingham were recalled and charmed the
auditors with their sweet singing.
After the entertainment another recep
tion was held and refreshments were
passed around by waiters.
The opening entertainment of Georga
H. Thomas Post No. 2 was a success. It
inaugurates a series of entertainments
which will be held every afternoon and

night at the headquarters, Lincoln Hall.

attended by an enormous crowd. Hun
dreds were unable to gain admission.
The programme was most enjoyable,

The chairman of the evening, Thomas
D. Barnstead, post commander Lincoln
Post, In welcoming the company, said:
"Age causes the heart to grow more
fond of Its sputhful associates and espe
cially so in the case of those associates
with whom days and months and years
of danger, trial, privation, hardship and
adventure have been passed, who have
drunk from the' same canteen, bitten
from the same piece of hardtack and
sipped from the same old battered tin cup
their morning coffee. Associates who have
fought side by side under that glorious
flag, the Stars and Stripes, and beheld it
waving and held aloft In victory time and
time againâ victorious through storm of
shot and shell and charge of sabered cav
alry. It makes the blood course more
quickly through our veins because of your
presence here to-night, al! of you full of
the great principles of fraternity, charity
and loyalty, three principles that bind us
firmly together.

Sam insists that he did a lot of fighting,
but he concedes that the army on the
land did a little more. He is a regular
attendant at all the encampments and
came all the way from Georgia to be
present at this one.
"Wai. it was somethin' like dis -way:
You see, I was jest standln' 'roun* de dock
at Po't Royal, Souf Callna, way back In
sixty somethin', when along came de
drafter of de navj'. who said he wanted
me right away aboard de gunboat. So
off dey take me, and when I get aboard
dey. ask me my name, an' I said Sam.
Wai, dey asked me who was my master,
an* I tole 'em his name was Kell, so dey
named me Sam Kell. an* 1 caln't get rid
ob It. De Government give me a pension
becajise I was fool enough to get in de
way' of some . shrapnel, which came
mighty near takin* off one of dem legs."
Sam comes under 'the heading of naval
heroes. He hails from Brunswick, Ga.,
and came into town with yesterday's
great throng of veterans. Dressed in a
dark blue suit of clothes and regulation
G. A. R. slouch hat. with tassel and
insignia, Sam, whose skin is as black as
the old time powder, presents an inter
esting spectacle as he hobbles about on
his legs, which are noticeably bowed and
Infirm.
In one hand he carries a small grip
and in the other he steadies himself with
an old cane.. In his valise there is a plp
ture of Abraham Lincoln, U. S. Grant
and Mary Maxwell, the latter his wife,
a fat and good natured ap.Dearing\old
"aunty" of whom Sam is seemingly very
proud. Asked concerning his experiences,
the old darky said yesterday:
Sam Maxwell was his name "befo* de
wa\" but- the - Government recruiting
squad took him in tow at Port Royal and
after one of his underpinnings had been
badly torn by a piece of shrapnel he was
sent to a hospital and later put on the
pension roll under the name of Sam Kell.
by which he is now known by nearly
every veteran who has attended an en
campment during the last thirty-five
years.
Sam Kell Is a Hero of Port

Takes Place
To*Day.
MYRIADS OF ELECTRIC LIGHTS GLEAM OVER THRONGS
Illumination Is a
Brilliant Fea*
ture.
Night Is Turned
Into Day by
Lights.
f^ELDOM have the thoroughfares of
S San Francisco been more resplen
â¢ Â¦ dent than last night. Â¦ V'
â¢*sÂ»' From the- Ferry to far out on the
- main thoroughfare incandescent
light made a canopy of flre that turned
night into day. Such a scene at brilliance
has rarely been witnessed in San Fran
cisco. The Illuminations in honor of the
return of the First California Regiment
and the coming of the two Presidents
were surpassed by the decorations In hon
or of the twenty-five thousand visitors
who now crowd the city.
The visitors that have attended en
campments in other large cities were as
tonished by the magnitude of the decora
tions. They marveled at the skill of the
decorators and the execution of their de
signs, and their superlatives failed them,
when expressing their surprise and pleas
ure at ths remarkable scene.
But they were not the only ones to ap
preciate . the illumination. Fully fifty
thousand people traversed Market street
between the hours of 8 o'clock and mid
night to view the decorations. Cable cars
moved through the dense masses at a
snail's pace. Wagons and carriages
sought other thoroughfares to reach their
destination. The crowd only separated
at the clang of the on-coming fire en
gines and as soon as they had passed,
once more closed in. The sidewalks were
so crowded that the street was used by
the pedestrians.
FERBY DEPOT OUTLINED.
The Ferry building loomed up at the
foot of Market street a tower of beauty.
The graceful outlines of the tall Union
Depot were shown by hundreds of elec
tric lights. All along Market street
strings of burning lights were festooned
across the street ten feet apart. On each
side of the street pendants of fire hung
and added to the effect.
As the visitor moved up Market street
In the cars his eyes were dazzled by the
splendor of the scene. The buildings were
outlined in all their strength. Eves tha
wholesale district bore an animated ap
pearance.
The building occupied by the Southern
Pacific Company at Montgomery and
Post streets presented a pleasing con
trast to the somber structures in -the
vicinity. Thousands of electric lamps
were used in decorating the building. The
terra cotta formed a pleasing background
to the lights. Eagles and army corps
badges were outlined in red. white and
blue lights and long ropes studded with
many-colored lamps were artistically sus
pended from the copings.
The Grand Hotel was imposing in its
dressing of flags and lights. The Palace
Hotel also loomed resplendent with thou
sands of electric globes.
ABCHES ARE MAGNIFICENT.
The arches at Third and Market streets
are wonderful to behold. Although all the
lights were not burning last night, those
who saw the handiwork of the decorators
gave praise. From the distance the ef
fect Is beautiful to behold. Frosted globes
outline the graceful architecture and ferns
and potted plants are distributed with ar
tistic effect. Above the arch is a shield
of American flags and beneath the em
blems is an epaulet with the letters "O.
A. R." emblazoned In light. Between the
two .arches are suspended strings of col
oredt electric lamps and in the center Is
an immense Grand Army badge outlined
in varied lights. By to-night the decora
tions on the arches will be complete and
then the beholder will be charmed.
The buildings occupied by the three
morning papers on' each side of the arches
are tastefully decorated with lights and
flags. Pictures of war heroes adorn the
buildings. Flags and bunting are used
In abundance In decoration.
The tall flag poles which have been
placed at a distance of twenty feet along
Market street add to the beauty of the
scene. From each pole floats a large
American flag and a few feet below the
emblem is a stand of colors. The electric
wires are attached to these poles and the
flags loom up in the brilliant light.
These poles are the property of the city,
and when the Grand Army hosts have de
parted they will be placed in the corpora
tion yard until needed again.
The White House at the corner of Post
and Kearny streets also presents a mag
nificent appearance. The building Is re
splendent with lights, and In each win
dow the American and French flags fly
in the breeze.
CITY HALL DOME.
The Emporium, Breuner*s and Hale
Brothers have decorated their buildings
in an artistic manner. Far out on Market
street the Central Theater dome is out
lined with lights. The City Hall dome
looks very attractive beneath Its cover-
Ing of incandescent lights. From a dis
tance the dome is boldly outlined and can
be seen for many miles. The rotunda has
been thrown open to visitors and will re
main open each night until 12 o'clock.
Employes of the Board of Public Works
will be on hand to insure the comfort of
the visitors.
The illumination will continue the en
tire week. In the opinion of many resi
dents, it is the finest electrical display
ever seen in this city. The visitor will al
ways recall the brilliant scene. Many
photographs were taken last night as me
mentos of the encampment.
SIGNAL MEN" ENTERTAIN.
Establish Headquarters at the Ellis-
Street Armory.
Lieutenant George C. Round, who Is cne
of the veterans of the G. A. R. and who
belonged to the Signal Corps during the
Civil War, Is stopping with his wife at

NICE HAIR TOR ALL.
Once Destroy the Dandruff Germ, and
Hair Grows Luxuriantly.
Any one can have nice hair if he or she
has not dandruff, which causes brittle,
dry hair, falling hair and baldness. To
cure dandruff it is necessary to kill the
*:errÂ« that causes It, and that Is just what
Newbro's Htrplcide does. Cornelius Grew,
Colfax, Wash., says:
"One bottle of Newbro's Herpicide com-
pletely cured me of dandruff, which was
very thick; and it has stopped my hair
from falling out." It makes hair soft
and glossy as silk: delightful odor, and
rc-freshing hair dressing. It permits the
hair to grow abundantly and kills the
dandruff germ. Sold by leading drug-

BUSINESS OF CONVENTION.
Â¦ "With thrse plans in view and fully
recognizing the deserving qualities of
General Black. It is natural that the del
egates from Massachusetts should take
no particularly active part in advocating
the candidacy of Miles at this time. Gen
eral Black, thrice wounded in the wars
through which he fought most bravely,
is the only man for the position of com
mander In chief of the Grand Army, and
If the help of the Massachusetts relega
tion is all he needs to get it he can rest
under the certainty of success." - . .
Next to the question of General Stew
art's successor the delegates regard as
mc5t Important the selection of the next
place of encampment. But three cities-
Denver, Atlantic City and Bostonâ are
after the encampment, but of these only
one Beemingly has been able to make
any noticeable impression upon the dele
gates. Boston already has made quite a
headway, having the advantage of being
more centrally located in the country and,
above all, having earned * a reputation
among the veterans for unbounding hos
pitality. The last time she bid for an
encampment her citizens gave as a starter
$50,000 toward the expenses of the event,
and then the Massachusetts Legislature
voted tlOO.OOO more to the fund. Later the
citizens of Boston added another JMOOO.
EOSTON IN THE LEAD.
"The Massachusetts delegates have
come to this encampment with the
avowed Intention of securing the next en
campment for Boston and we have pood
reasons for believing that we will be suc
cessful in our undertaking. If such proves
the case. Boston will surpass all previous
efforts in making the encampment the
greatest ever held within the history of
the Grand Army, for it will probably be
the last time the soldiers will gather there
us an organization. The world knows
how Massachusetts reverences the old
soldiers, for she mourns for many who
<2ied upon the battlefields. At this prom
ised encampment Massachusetts hopes
to pee General Miles elevated to the head
of the Grand Army, and In that event it
wiJI accord him an ovation In Boston that
will not be witnessed again by the old
soldiers who will participate.
â¢ In the delegation from Massachusetts
there Is a very strong feeling for General
Miles. It was in the Twenty-second Mas
sachusetts Infantry in 1861 that General
Miles, then a mere boy of 22 years of age,
entered upon what later proved a brll-
Iiar.t military career and naturally the
people of that State are proud of the
man they claim as one of their heroes.
But when several of them were asked
yÂ«*terday regarding the probable stand
of the delegates from there on the ques
tion of commander In chief of the Grand
Army, they agreed that it was a bit
too early to launch General Miles' can
didacy for the position. A promlent del
egate said:
the pallantry of the late commander of
the regular army, conceded that the po
sition of honor in the Grand Army right
fully belongs to the Illinois military hero
and expressed the hope that he would
receive it with the unanimous vote of his
old comrades now assembled in this city.

Grand Opera-house on Thursday morn
ing, so busy have they been at their own
headquarters, settling themselves for jlhe
week and renewing old acquaintances
among the throngsÂ»of veterans from all
sections of the country. It was stated at
General Stewart's headquarters yesterday
that it is too early to determine Just what
Important matters would come before the
delegates.
General J. Corey Winans stated that no
comm|ttee reports had been received ex
cept from the national advisory counsel
and that report included nothing of "Im
portance to the public or the veterans.
Few recommendations for changes in the
by-laws are expected and it is not be
lieved that the pension committee will
recommend many radical changes in the
pension laws. ' l<\'~
The Connecticut delegation has rooms
on the first floor of the Palace Hotel. The
delegation Is led by ex-Governor Morgan
S. Bulkeley. They are seventy-five in
number. The prominent members of the
party who accompanied Commander
Bulkeley to the encampment a?e: Senior
Vice Commander Virgil F. McNeil, Jun
ior Vice Commander Charles W. Gros
venor. Assistant Adjutant General Henry
E. Taintor, Assistant Quartermaster Gen
eral William Whitelaw, Medical Director
Dr. Jewett.
Lincoln Post No. 1, George H. Thomas
Post No. 2, Atlanta Post No. 93 and the
various other big posts of this city have
opened headquarters in Pioneer, Steln
way and California halls. The halls have
been handsomely decorated and the com
mittee in charge is doing its utmost to
make the visitor comfortable. The local
posts are expending large sums of money
in entertainment. During the week there
will be numerous receptions, to which the
most distinguished members of the army
have been invited.
General Black; who is looked upon as
the probable successor to General Stew
art as commander in chief of the Grand
Army of the Republic, has no headquar
ters. He stood in the corridor of the
Palace Hotel yesterday and held a levee.
Hundreds of veterans trooped by him and
the distinguished soldier had a kindly
word and smile for each of them. His
knowledge of army affairs is most re
markable. He was able to greet each
comrade and, after noting the regiment
in which he belonged, tell him with un
erring accuracy, what battles he was in
and where his regiment was stationed
during the war. - He knew the corps, the
general commanding the regiment and
even officers who distinguished them
selves in battle. He had a hearty greet
ing for all and his popularity was e\
denced by the manner in which the old
soldiers pressed forward to/express their
feeling for him. If the reception General
Black received yesterday is a criterion, he
will be elected to the command of the
Grand Army of the Republic without a
doubt. So far no opposition has mani
fested Itself against his candidacy.

HEADQUARTERS ARE THROWN OPEN,
The murderers have terrorized the
Chinese in I^as Amarillas, La Colorado
and other surrounding mining camps and
several have already fled while others
are preparing to leave. The authorities
claim that they have been unable to find
any trace of the perpetrators of the ter
rible deed. Robbery was the motive for
the crime, but a bitter feeling has arisen
in Mexico against Chinese and particu
larly in Sonora, which is overrun with
Mongolians, arriving at Guaymas with
the Intention of crossing to the United
States. This ill feeling has led to the
Chinese exclusion regulations recently
promulgated in Mexico. The Chinese rec
ognize that they are not safe in some
of the smaller camps and are fleeing to
the larger places for protection.

ROME, Aug. 17.â The memorandum of
the Bulgarian Government to the powers
regarding the situation in Macedonia has
produced a great effect here. The general
Impression is that the Bulgarian Govern
ment Is no longer able to hold back popu
lar feeling, which, unless It is repressed
In time, will lead to a war with Turkey.
The fate of Bulgaria In that event. It is
believed, probably would be the same as
that of Greece In the last war with Tur
key. The Italian Government Is ex
changing views on the subject with Vi
enna and London.

to-day and received assurances from the

the slightest desire . to antagonize Tur

responsibility for the Macedonian revo
lution belonged.
SOFIA, Aug. 17.â The foreign diplomats
here are anxiously watching the effect of
the memorandum which the Bulgarian
Government has presented to the pow
era on the subject of the condition of
affairs in Macedonia. They fear it may
excite popular opinion in Bulgaria, and
point out that such emphatic, outspoken
criticism is usually reserved for manifes
tos issued on the eve of war, although
it is regarded as being quite improbable...
that the memorandum was a prelude in
the present case to anything more serious
than increased tension.

I have confirmatory advices as to the general
character of the revolution. Turkey has a free
hand, so far as the militarv operations within
her own territory are concerned, but thÂ« sup

of International complications, which the pow^

The powers are acting' harmoniously. Noth

effort Is being made by the powers to main
tain peace between those countries.

told of a terrible experience with tivÂ«
mountain lions which no kept at bay all

night by the deep roaring of a lion. Then

Ragsdale knew that ha had been sur

a small hatchet. The nearest assistance
was more than three miles away, and ho
realised that he could not leave the loca
tion of his bunk without a battle. Ills
fire was being extinguished by a Heavy
rain that was falling, and he knew that
if it died out it would be the signal for an
attack. IIÂ© could see the glare of th*
famishing creatures' eyes and see- their
long gaunt forms not more than twenty
five feet off.
Ragsdale had to get wood for his fire.
and after tossing to the blaze all tho
branches he had used In the bunk, ha
started toward the thicket guided by th*
increasing flames. While cutting away at
pine branches, one of the lions left Its re
treat and made for him. Ragadale
wheeled about pnd raised the hatchet
above his head. Something made tho
mountain king chanpe its Intention, for
with a frightful roar it backed off into the
thicket. The entire night was spent by
Ragsdale in keeping back the huge brutes.
When found by his companions he was
more dead than alive, and Is now in this
city recuperating after his thrilling ex
perience.

In the meantime, her husband had com
municated with the county authorities,
but no trace of the kidnaper could be
found. Mrs. Hilsrow is in a critical con
dition from exposure.
this would cut a considerable figure in
the discussion of the subject in Colombia,
but. the question of money consideration,
it is said, faded away and was replaced
by the sovereignty issue.
The question has I been raised as to
whether the Spooner amendment does "not
make it compulsory upon the Govern
ment to proceed with the purchase of the
Nlcaraguan. route, now that the negojtla
tions with Colombia have failed. Many
statesmen here . who expressed opinions
were of the belief that the passage of
the. amendment made this procedure
mandatory. Colombia, It is declared, has
forfeited the last chance to have anÂ« in
ter-oceanlc waterway constructed
through her territory.

WELL-KNOWN JOUBNALIST
IS SUMMONED BY DEATH
GUARD SUSPECT
IN STEEL CAGE
An interestins feature of the whole de
bate In the Colombian. Senate, and the
committee's report favoring the treaty is
said to have been the entire absence of
reference to the question 'of indemnity
offered by the United States for the right
of way. It was generally supposed that
â¢ â¢I-I-H"M"I"M"M II I I II I 1 ! I u-l*
It will be impossible for President Mar
roquln to again submit the treaty to the
Colombian Congress In its present \ form.
The Senate having rejected it, the treaty
cannot again come before that body ex
cept bv the Senate's own vote. Presi
dent Marroquln, however, can j send the
treaty slightly amended to the Senate
and reopen the canal debate. It is be
lieved at the Colombian legation that
President Marroquin will adopt some such
procedure.
The reason given '^ for the rejection of
the treaty by the Colombian Senate, it
is said here, was the alleged encroach
ment on Colombian sovereignty â¢ which,
its opponents contended, would result
from the treaty. This information was
contained In a dispatch received to-night
by Dr. Herran, the Colombian Charge,
from Foreign Minister Rlcos at Bogota.
This dispatch showed that in its present
form the treaty was absolutely unaccept
able to the Senate, and that it had been
rejected unanimously.
The view taken by the > Senate was at
variance to that held by the Government
of Colombia, which felt satisfied when
it submitted the treaty to Congress that
there would be no Impairment to Colom
bian sovereignty if the treaty were rati
fied. Incidental to tho general question
of sovereignty necessarily . was that of
the lease of the strip of land through
which the canal was to be constructed,
and the debate in the Colombian Senate
indicated that that ; body regarded this
as amounting to a sale of the land, there
fore . objectionable.
When the treaty was submitted to the
Senate by the committee to which it had
been referred seven -of the Senators fa
vored it, with certain amendments which*
they proposed, and the remaining two op
posed it absolutely. The amendments pro
posed by the majority are not stated here,
but they evidently referred to the ques
tion of sovereignty, as is Indicated by
the subsequent rejection of the treaty in
its present form.

diately advised of the news, Beaupre's

cate what course the United States would

Question of Sover
eignty Results in
Adverse Action
Â¦ It Is quite certain that the action of Co
lombia will induce some consultations of
importance in the near future and possi
bly some action by Congress at the, extra
ordinary session.
It appears that one of the objections
to the ratification which carried weight in
the Senate was that the Panama Canal
Company did not come to a previous ar
rangement: with the Colombian Govern
ment for the transfer of the concession.
The action taken by the Senate, how
ever, seems to have been influenced by the
communication made by the American
Minister, in which the introduction of any
amendments to the treaty was objected
to.
were proposed would be unsatisfactory.
The absolute rejection of the treaty fol
lowed, v '
General Valezzo, an old veteran and a
distinguished army officer, probably will
be appointed Military Governor of the
district of Panama. It Is thought that
the fears caused by the rumors of a se
cession movement on the isthmus may
have influenced the appointment.
BOGOTA, Aug. 17.â It was rumored to
day that President Marroquln had been
authorized by Congress to make a new
treaty, which would not require further
ratification, but that the basis given for
the treaty probably would prove unac
ceptable to the United States.
It is considered, however, in official cir
cles, according to reliable information,
that the authorization given by Congress
to make a new treaty will supply a basis
for reopening negotiations with the
United States.
PANAMA, Aug. 17.â The unanimous re
jection of the Panama canal treaty by the
Senate has caused a profound impression
here in all circles. The question on all
lips is: What will become of Panama?
The only consolation the isthmians have
Is that the" rest of the republic, with the
exchange at a very high figure and with
an upward tendency, will suffer a great
deal more. It seems that the Government
never expected the treaty to be ratified
and it was not supported at all in tho
Senate.
The rejection is a heavy blow to prop
erty owners here, who have been Invest
ing heavily on the prospects of the treaty
being ratified.
High authorities on the isthmus ex
press the opinion that President Roose
velt may insist on the right of the United
States to purchase the canal enterprise
from the French company. Colombia hav
ing sanctioned the sale, and take imme
diate . steps toÂ» show Colombia that the
United States Is determined to go through
with the project, at the same time in
forming the Colombian Government that
the obstacles in the way of the transfer,
viz., thfc questions of money and the
sovereignty and jurisdiction over the
property involved, etc., are questions for
subsequent settlement and possible arbi
tration at the Hague.
Others think that Colombia will soon
recognize the seriousness of her mistake
in not' ratifying the treaty, as the United
States' and European nations will lose no
time in enforcing their claims on Colom
bia.
by. Colombia, as a mere threat on the part
of the United States. They are convinced
that the' Nicaraguan project is impossible
and that the United States jvill again
deal 'with Colombia.

Danzlger was questioned and stoutly
asserted that he was of legal age, but
as he was unable to produce evidence
to support his claims the license was
withheld. The young people left the
courthouse greatly disheartened and spent
the morning beneath the trees in St.
James Park. After dinner at the St.
James they returned to San Francisco.
The attempt at matrimony is said to be
the result of a romantic runaway and,
although Danziger asserts that his pa
rents knew of his prospective marriage
and had raised no objections .to It, the
story Is current that no one was in the
confidence of the young people, but that
their plans were inadvertently discovered
by the parents of the young man, who
called upon Chief Wittman to aid them
in preventing the nuptials. Shortly before
Danziger and his companion took the
train for San Francisco the young man
received a message from his parents, and
it is supposed that the couple have re
turned to Danzlger's home to attempt to
obtain the consent of his relatives.
..Detective Pickering was detailed to no
tify the County Clerk to refuse a license
to the couple and he was just in time.

KAXSAS CITY. Mo.. Aug. 17.-Boats
are again being used to transport persons
between the two Kansas Citys, the
James-street foot and" wagon bridge and
the Metropolitan-street Railway Com
pany's bridge over the Kansas River hav
ing been carried out by the strong cur
rent. The river is higher than at any
time since the June flood and other struc
tures are In danger. The wrecked bridges
are temporary pile affairs, hastily con
structed two months ago. A further rise
is expected, as half a dozen tributaries to
the Kansas River west of here are bank
full.
The river has been turbulent for more
than a week past and the strong current
has brought In great quantities of drift
wood from the west. The James-street
bridge was partially wrecked yesterday.
Soon after it went out this morning It
floated down and took out the street rail
v.-ay bridge, severing the main line of
communication across the river and car
rying with it Kansas City. Kans., gas
mains and the telephone cable. The
wreckage of the two bridges finally
lodged against the Chicago Great West
ern Railway bridge and while it weak
ened the structure and put it out of ser
vice, it will, it Is believed, remain intact.
Further on, much driftwood caught at
the flow-line bridge, which furnished the
Missouri city with its principal water
Fupply. No fiamaje resulted to this
bridge and no apprehension is felt regard
ing it unless there is a gTeat rise In the
river, which seems unlikely. At most,
the river will not rise above four feet
higher. All streams in Kansas, including
the Knw, the Smoky Hill and the Re
publican rivers, are rising, the result of
heavy rains last night, and this water is
expected here late to-morrow.
Tbe Stock Yards Company has a large
force of men at work protecting its pile
bridge, over which livestock for the Ar
mourdale packing-house -is driven from
the main yards. General Manager Rust
feels confident that the structure will
stand.
The Belt Line bridge is being kept in
place by a heavily laden freight train.
Miss J. J. Grathwol. sister of Miss
Katherlne Grathwol. received a letter
from Katherlne recently. It was dated
August S and was as follows:
I have an engagement for next Sunday. A
gentleman called on Nellie Stone and asked
her *o go up 1* Cumbre trail on that day.
They asked me to go and Insisted that they
would not go unless I went. So I accepted
and shall go if nothing happens. Le Cumbre
is the highest peak in thesÂ« parts and it is
considered a great feat to climb it. I pleaded
inability to ride, but the gentleman Insisted
that he would secure a surefooted horse, and.
if need be would strap me on. Really, I am
quite anxious to go. as I think it would b*
quite an experience. We leave early tn the
morning and do not return until night.
Miss Grathwol had requested the friends
with whom she was making the ascent
on horseback to proceed without her after
half the distance had been covered, stat
ing that she would remain until their re
turn. The party v/ent only a couple of
miles and then returned. Not findlnff
Miss Grathwol where she had been left,
they proceeded a short distance along the
trail and found her prostrate body lying
in thp *un. Efforts to revive her were
futile, and she died half an hour later.
Miss Grathwol came to Santa Barbara
five months ago from St. Paul, accompa
nied by her mother, hoping to improve
her health.
The other members of the party have
returned unlnjuied.
ST. PAUL", Minn., Aug. 17.â Miss Kath
erlne Grathwol was a teacher in one ot

ily is well known here. Her mother waa

SANTA BARBARA, Aug. 17.-An in
quest held to-day over the remains of
Miss Catherine Grathwol; who died on
the mountain trail to the aummlt of thÂ«
Santa Ynez range yesterday afternoon,
developed the fact that the young wo
man's death was caused by heart failure
brought about by exhaustion. The Cor
oner's deputies who went after the re
mains returned early this morning after
a most difficult and hazardous trip. The
body had to be tied on the back oi a
horse and brought over the narrow trail
in the darkness.
The Secretary of War believes that the
construction of these roads would be of
immense benefit and would settle for all
time the question of possible insurrection
in the Island of Luzon, as they would aid
vastly in the patroling of all sections of
the island.
WASHINGTON, Augr. 17.-Secretary
Root has been in correspondence with
Governor Taft regarding the construction
of a system of railroads in the Philippine
Islands aggregating 600 miles. It is pro
posed to build f line from Manila north
through Luzon to a harbor at the north
ernmost end of the Island. Another pro
jected line Is a branch from the north
and south line over the mountains to the
eastern coast. Another proposed line is
from Manila south to Batancas. It has
been suggested also that a line be con
structed along the west coast of Luzon
from Dagupan, the present terminus of
the Manila and Dagupan road, to the
north end of the Island.
The propositions which have been con
sidered by the Secretary of War and the
Governor of the Philippines contemplate
aid by the Filipino Government In the
proposed roads. It is believed that a
gruarantee of the interest on the amount
of the cost of the roads. In case they
prove unable to pay such interest out of
the earnings, will be sufficient to Induce
capital to invest in the enterprise. The
Philippine Government, could not make
grants of lands to aid In the construc
tion of the roads, but it could grant
rights of way. \
It has been determined that the Phil
ippine Government has the authority to
guarantee the interest on the railroad
bonds, the payment of interest, Jf made,

"57-HS9 WASHINGTON STREET,
. Oakland.OFFICER IN COMMAND OF
( FIGHTING SHIPS REVIEWED
YESTERDAY BY PRESIDENT.
As President of the United States I ' wish
on behalf of the entire country to greet you
as representatives, officers and enlisted men
of the American navy. Every man aboard
the Olympia must feel that on him rests a
double duty to see to it that the ship's name
Khali be forevermore a symbol of victory and
glory to all the people of our country. Noth
ing pleased me more than to see myself to
day how high Is the standard of the enlisted
men of the navy. I do not believe that our
navy has ever been at a higher point of effi
ciency. Month by month the already high
Ftandard is being raised even higher. All
alike share in the duty and share In > the
honor which comes of the duty well done.
Whether the service is rendered In the con
ning tower, or in the gun turrets, or In the
engine room. It matters not so long as the
service Itself Is of the highest possible kind.
This ship commemorates forever the name of
Admiral Dewey as the name of the Hartford
commemorates that of Admiral Farragut. And
I ask you all as Americans, proud af your
country, from the admiral down to the last
enlisted landsman or the youngest apprentice,
to appreciate alike the high honor and heavy
responsibility of your positions.
At the conclusion the men cheered the
President and then Admiral Dewey.
When the President went to the Yankee,
where he met the landsmen in training,
he was struck by the fact that the crew
consisted of landsmen who had been only
two and a half months in service, many
from New York . and Pennsylvania and
ON THE OLYMPIA. s
On the Olympla he again was requested
to say a word to the enlisted men. He
said in substance:
happy to eay that the. American seamen have
nflver been found deficient In the fighting edge
le firat requisite of... the .fighting man. I
do not praise you for being brave- that is
expected^ The coward Is to be condemned
rather than the brave man to be praised. I
expect every one to show a perfect willing
ness to die rather than to see the slightest
etaln put upon the American flag, but in ad
dition you must know how to flght aa well
as know how to die; then you will be what
I believe you are. the most efficient fighting
force In the world. I again thank you for
what you are. A peculiar responsibility at
taches to each and every one of you. It
has been a pleasure to eee the ship and the
guns, but above all the men behind the guns.
The President asked the name and
birthplace of each of the gun pointers.
They included men from all States in
the Unionâ California, Texas, North Caro
lina, Maine. Indiana, Michigan, Minne
sota # and Washington, as well" as from
Germany and Ireland. Norway and Swe
den. The President was especially, struck
with the large proportion of men from
the Middle West.

HEAD-ON COLLISION
HAS FATAL RESULTS
Both Mexicans and Americans who hap
pened to be in Lower California when the
strike was made flocked to the scene.
Others, at Guaymas are preparing to set
sail for La Paz for a visit to the scene
of the strike' A Mexican named Miguel
Cornejo, who lives at La Paz, is said to
have been made rich in one day by the
wonderful gold find on his property,
which is near that of Mendoza and his as
sociates. Not far from the scene of the
gold find some quarries of marble of a
very high grade have been discovered and
are being opened up. They are being ex
ploited by a corps of American engineers
who are said also to have gone In on the
ground floor and made valuable locations
where the gold was recently discovered.
GUAYMAS, Mexico. Aug. 17.âPas
sengers who arrived at this port yester
day from La Paz, Lower California, on
the steamer Union bring wonderful tales
of the new gold discoveries at San Simon,
near Triufo, on the lower end of the
peninsula. As a verification of these re
ports, the Union carried $75,000 in placer
gold which was taken out of the new
fields. This large shipment of placer gold
was brought into La Paz from the mines
in a wagon guarded by four Iturales. It
came from the property of a Mexican
named Juan H. Mendoza, who with his
associates controls a great deal of the
ground In the vicinity of the recent strike.

After chatting with Admiral Barker and
casually inspecting the Kearsarge the
President, before visiting the other flag
ships to return the calls of the rear ad
mirals, addressed the enlisted men and
officers of the ship. When they had been
drawn .' up on the gundeck he spoke as
follows: .
ADDRESSES ENLISTED MEN.
"Wehave with us representatives of an
international incident. . As to that, may
the best boat win."
With laughter and applause that toast
likewise was drunk by the guests stand-
Ing.
Captain Dechair of the British embassy
proposed the health of the President.
At. the conclusion of the hincheon the
officers returned to their ships. At 12:28
the President left the Mayflower In a
barge for the flagship Kearsarge to re
turn the call of Rear Admiral Barker.
He was accompanied by Secretary Moody,
Admiral Dewey, Rear Admiral Rodgers,
Rear Admiral Taylbr, .General Chaftee
and Commander Albert Gleaves of the
Mayflower,
The Mayflower flred a President's sa
lute as the barge cleared the ship. As
the President went aboard the Kearsarge
his flag was broken out at the mainpeak
and every one of the twelve saluting
ships In the fleet flred a President's sa
lute. â¢ Â¦
During the luncheon the President said:
"We have with us to-day, representatives
of the great powers, Great Britain, Ger
many, Russia and Japan. 'I ask you to
drinkvto these great powers and to their
sovereigns."
The toast was drunk standing. Then
the President continued:
President Roosevelt entertained his
guests and all the commanding officers
of the fleet at luncheon on , board the
Mayflower.
Among the other guests of the Presi
dent on the Mayflower were Assistant
Secretary of War Sanger, Sir Thomas
Lipton, C. Oliver Iselin,' Butler Duncan,
Colonel Sharman-Crawford, a represen
tative of the Royal Ulster Yacht Club,
and Emlen Roosevelt.
At the conclusion of the review Presi
dent Roosevelt received on .board the
Mayflower Rear Admiral Albert S. Bar
ker, commander In chief of the North
Atlantic fleet; Rear Admiral James A.
Sands, commander of the Caribbean;
Rear Admiral Joseph B. Coghlan, com
manding the coast squadron, and Rear
Admiral William C. Wise, commanding
the training squadron. He also received
the captains and commanding officers of
the twenty-two vessels in the fleet. He
received also the naval attaches of the
legation of four of the. great powers â
Captain Dechair of the British embassy.
Captain Edwin Schaefer of the German
embassy, Commander \V. C. Boutakoff of
the Russian embassy, and Lieutenant
Commander Isham Taklshika of the Jap
anese legation.
KECEIVES THE ADMIRALS.
by. jackies.in white duck, the marines
were paraded \ and, presented arms, \ . the
President's salute of, twenty-one guns
was fired, the buglers sounded- a flourish,
the drummers gave four, ruffles, the band
played "Hail. Columbia," and the entire
crew stood at salute. As the Mayflower
swept majestically past each ship tho
crew of the saluting vessel gave the
President three cheers as the commander
in chief of the army and navy of 'the
United States.
President Roosevelt, who was intently
watching the sauadron of destroyers
when tho accident occurred, remarked
that such accidents, especially, to de
stroyers, were likely to occur at any time.
In the execution of war maneuvers some
chances, he said, must be taken, and if
the time ever should come when the navy
was afraid of scratching oft tho paint of
a vessel its efficiency would, deteriorate
materially. '
Both the President and Mrs. Roosevelt
noted the accident with calmness, , not
withstanding the fact that their son Ker
mlt was on board the Decatur at the time
of the collision. He was standing beside
Lieutenant Chandler when the vessel ran
alongside the Mayflower. .
In â¢ commenting upon the accident - Ad
miral Dewey said that amounted to little
and would delay the vessels in their
movements only a few days. He said
that such an accident was part of the
war game and must sometimes be ex
pected.
The review occurred on Long Island,
two and a half miles off the entrance to
Oyster Bay. President Roosevelt,' in com
pany with Secretary of the Navy Moody,
Admiral Dewey, Rear Admiral . Taylor,
Rear Admiral Rodgers, Captain Brown
son, General Chaffee and General Barry,
stood on.' the bridge of the auxiliary
crulBer. Mayflower as she steamed slowly
down one column of the warships and
up the other. The two columns extended
2500 yards, the ships being anchored . at
Intervals of 600' yards. As the Mayflower
passed each ship in the ' two columns | the
Xards and rails of each ship were manned
PRESIDENT SEES COLLISION.
'. and . inspected in time of peace
a great fleet of' United States warships.
The ceremony was a magnificent and im
pressive naval spectacle. It was un
marred by the slightest mishap until Just
at its conclusion when the torpedo-boat
destroyer Barry rammed the destroyer
Decatur, fortunately, however, doing lit
tle damage. The incident was exciting.
It occurred just at the moment when
the President was receiving congratula
tions upon the success of the maneuvers.
The first squadron of destroyers, consist-
Ing of the Decatur, Balnbrldge, Barry.
Dale and Chauncey, all under command
of lieutenant H. L. Chandler, was ap
proaching the Mayflower at full speed.
The vessels were In close formation. ' Or
ders were signaled from the Decatur to
the other vessels to form a wedge. In
executing the orders the Decatur swung
across the bow of the Barry. An instant
later the Barry rammed her nose o"n the
starboard side. As the ships were run
ning at a speed of twenty knots the blow
was tremendous. The Decatur listed
sharply to port and seemed to be in seri
ous distress. From the Mayflower she
appeared to be sinking. The Mayflower's
boats were manned instantly, but were
not lowered, as the Decatur was soon
able to right herself. In a few minutes
she hoisted a signal of "No serious dam
age." Later she steamed alongside the
Mayflower and Lieutenant Chandler re
ported that while his ship had received
a bad bump on the starboard quarter she
was not materially damaged. The injury
was plainly evident from the de,ck of the
Mayflower. The destroyer had been struck
about half way between stern and mid
ship, and a large rent had been made in
her plates. The starboard rail was dam
aged, but otherwise the vessel was, intact.
The Barry, which had struck tho Decatur
a glancing blow, had her bow crumpled
by the collision, but she was not Injured
otherwise. The accident put a sudden
stop to the maneuvers of the destroyer
squadron. The vessels came to an Im
mediate stop, the Bainbridge, Dale and
Chauncey standing by the two in collis
ion. Boats were lowered from two of
them. After a casual examination of the
Injuries to the Barry and Decatur the
boats returned to their vessels. - Admiral
Dewey ordered Lieutenant Ctmndler to
proceed with the five vessels to the' Brook
lyn navy yard, where such repairs as may
be necessary could be made. After the
damage is repaired the squadron will re
join the fleet and continue the summer
maneuvers.
OYSTER BAY. N. Y., Aug. 17.-For
-the first time in thai â¢ history of
the country the President of the
Â¦Â¦United States to-day reviewed
The Indians employed In the mines and
on the ranches do not seem in the least
disturbed by their hostile brethren, but
the Mexican proprietors are nevertheless
uneasy, not knowing what plot the In
dians may be hatching. The Yaqui makes
It a practice to accumulate arms and
ammunition and keep them hidden until
an appointed day. when he breaks out in
rebellion. The last insurrection began In
this way and the presence of these hostile
hands in the country always causes great
alarm.
The second band is reported to be much
larger than the first an<! has been operat
ing In the vicinity of Batamote, plunder-
Ing ranches and holding up travelers on
the highway, but as yet no murders are
known to have been committed by this
band. When last seen the Indians were
heading for the Moctezuma district and
great alarm is felt there. The ranchers
are prepared to resist the raiders and a
lively fight is expected when they meet.
Colonel Kostelitzky, who was at Mag
dalena when the first raids were reported.
left immediately with a troop of rurales
to Intercept the raiding bands. As he
was a great distance from tho scene of
the operations of the raiders it is doubt
ful whether he will be able to Intercept
them bofore they have' committed new
depredations and have fled again to the
rough and ragged Sierra Madre. where It
is impossible to run them down.
LOCALES, Ariz., Aug. 17.â Mining men
errivlng at the line and coining from
Minas Prietas report that two TaquI
bands have been committing many dep
redations in that vicinity for the past few
days. One of the bands held up the stage
et Zubiate recently and killed the driver,
â¢while the second band but recently came
down out of the mountains, encouraged
by the success of the one which pre
ceded It. The Mexican authorities had
relaxed their vigilance after the first raid,
belie\ing that the Indians had retreated
to their hiding places In the mountains,
when the camps at La Colorado. Minas
Prietas and Zubiate were startled by re
ports of new depredations. A trader
named San Jose de Pimas was held up
on the highway near Zubiate by the In
dian?, and when he offered resistance
â¢was killed by the bloodthirsty savages.
The Indians carried- away everything on
his wagon which they could pack off on
their horsrs. On another raid in the same
vjclnlty two Mexicans were held up by
a- band of Yaquis arid robbed of every
thing of value in their possession. Their
lives were spared only because they, saw
the dancer and offered no resistance to
the Indians.

Upon being cross-examined they admit
ted that most of the signers to the peTi
tion reside in Colma proper and not In the
outside territory proposed to be incor
porated. Both of the witnesses denied
ahat they were being influenced by pool-
' sellers or gamblers or that they were urg
ing the Incorporation for this class of peo
ple.
John Daley, a large property holder in
the northern portion of the county, asked
the privilege of addressing the board. He
said he had been accused by Supervisor
Eikerenkotter of being behind the scheme
to incorporate Colma and of having well
known gamblers behind him. This, he
claimed, was absolutely false. He de
manded that Eikerenkotter prove his
statements. On account of the question
raised aÂ« to the legality of tl.e petition In
Its present state, the further hearing was
continued to September a.
R. S. Thornton and James Casey, two
of the persons who circulated the peti
tion, made statements aa to the necessity
of incorporation. They said that they are
without any fire protection at the present
time; that a water supply is a necessity,
and that from a sanitary standpoint sew
ers are a necessity. They said they also
need street lights, good streets and side
walks and a police force, some of which
they can have under the present condi
tions.
REDWOOD CITY. Aug. 17.â At this aft
ernoon's sepsion of the Board of Super
visors the Colma incorporation proceed
ings were again taken up, but on account
of objections to the petition not much
progress was made.' H. W. Brown ob
jected to the consideration of certain
names appearing on the petition on the
ground that several of them do not ap
pear on the Great Register of the county,
as the law requires; and ethers which are
signed by a mark were also excepted to.
The petition contains the names of six
ty-four signers. The law requires at least
fifty. Eight of the sixty-lour have witTi
drawn their names and nine others are
objected to as not qualified to be on It.
If the board should rind that the excep
tions are well taken the foundation for
the proceedings will be demolished and
tne scheme to incorporate fall.
As time passes the opponents of Incor
poration gain in strength. Even should
the proceedings pass the board it is now
doubtful whether they will receive the
necessary vote of the people.
The petitioners called as a witness this
afternoon J. George. Smith, the engineer
who made the survey of the proposed
limits of the town. He testified that the
territory comprised about l.Ine square
miles. He admitted on cross-examination
that the greater portion of the proposed
town consisted of farming and garden
lands.

AUGUSTA, Me., Aug. 17.-LIke a
voice from the crave came a' letter to
day addressed to Mary Georgle Diplock
of this city, from a brother whom she
and all her relatives had mourned as
killed in the' Custer massacre, of the
Little Big Horn, 33 years ago. It had
been their firm conviction that George
B. Smith, Mrs. Dlplock's ' brother, was
one of the. .brave little band that Sitting
Bull annihilated on that morning. in 1S76-
They knew he was in the army with
Custer and from the date of the massacre
until to-day nothing was ever heard from
him.
The letter received to-day was post
marked Oakland. Cal.. and showed that
the writer. Smith, was the owner of a
valuable stock farm fifteen miles out of
Oakland. He says that it was by the
merest chance that he was not in the
Little Big Horn flght. His company had
been detailed under Gibbons, who went
up the Little Yellowstone, while Custer
and his command started for the Rose
bud. Gibbons' force was near Custer
during the fight, but too far to be of any
service. Smith is now 53 years old.

RETURN" TO MAYFLOWEE.
Upon the return of the President to the
Mayflower after his call upon the flag offi
cers, the vessel got under way and
steamed eastward for Feveral miles, com
ing to anchor then in order that the fleet
might pass In review. The vessels of the
fleet weighed anchor and in single col
umn, headed by the Kearsarge. steamed
slowly past the Mayflower. The yards
and rails of every vessel were manned,
the marines were paraded and the bands
played "Hail, Columbia." President
Roosevelt, with his distinguished naval
guests, reviewed the fleet from the May
flower's bridge. All were afforded an ad
mirable opportunity to view the ships, as
many of them passed within one hundred
yards of -the Mayflower. The marines on
the Yankee wore campaign-- hats Instead
of the regulation helmets. Remarking
upon this to Admiral Dewey, the Presi
dent said:
"How much better those marines look
in campaign hats than they do in their
peaked helmets. They ought to wear
them constantly."
Hundreds of pleasure craft of all de
scriptions hovered about the Mayflower
throughout the day, and during the final
review many of them persisted in run
ning between the fleet and the President's
ship. Fearing an accident, the President
ordered that they should be kept away.
A steam barge therefore performed that
duty. Commenting upon the action of
some pleasure boats, tho President said
It was precisely as if one were reviewing
a" regiment with a mob between himself
and tho troops, except that in this in
stance the occupants of the boats were in
the gravest danger.
As a termination of the review lieu
tenant Chandler's squadron of destroyers
passed the Mayflower in flying wedge
formation. The vessels were so close to
each other that ordinary conversation
between any one of them was easy. Soon
after they had passed the Chauncey's
steering gear became disabled and she
was forced to drop out of line tempora
rily. The vessels were re-forming to pass
the reviewing ship as a flying wedge at
full speed when the accident already de
scribed occurred.

Davis persisted in asking that the ex

not grant his request and simply replied
that the exception had been entered.

the appointment of Davis was of Davis'
seeking and was with the hope that he
might involve the estate in litigation and
get large fees. A motion to have him re
moved is based upon the affidavits. Davis
began litigation on behalf of the minor
children in a suit involving rights to a
hotel property at San Jose. The appoint
ment of Davis as guardian was made by
Judge Gear, a former law partner of Da

Sanitary Inspectors Commence Cam
paign for the Destruction of
the Mosquito Family.
HONOLULU, August 17.â The Board of
Health has inaugurated a campaign
against the mosquito. All the sanitary
Inspectors in Honolulu, of whom there
are fifteen or twenty, have been instruct
ed to fill in such breeding places as they
may find upon their daily rounds. This is
but the beginning of j a campaign which
will include liberal doses; of kerosene to
ponds with other means *k exterminating
the pests. The generally accepted theory
that the mosquito is responsible for the
spread of the dengue fever is the cause
of this activity on the part of thÂ© Board
of Health.
There Is to be a meeting of the mem
bers of the board very soon with real
estate men, property owners and others
who are- Interested in the extermination
of the mosquito in Honolulu. That the
little pest is not a valuable asset toi the
city, whether it spreads dengue or not,
is everywhere recognized. As an active
tourist campaign is -now being inaugur
ated throughout 'the States, the mer
chants are somewhat sensitive as to any
mention of the existence of mosquitoes in
Honolulu, though the pests are known to
have increased enormously In recent
years. -&'. .;
Professor George H. Rowe to Be an
Instructor in the Department of
Electrical Engineering.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Aug. 17.-
The appointment of George H. Rowe to
the position of associate professor In the
department of electrical engineering was
announced to-day. The new member of
the Stanford faculty was called by Dr.
Jordan from the University of Colorado,
where for the past eight years he has
served as dcari of/ the School of Applied
Science and professor of electrical en
gineering. His addition to the Stanford
department will be an important one, as
he has had wide practical as well as the
oretical training in his profession. He is
a graduate of the University of Michigan
with the degree of B. S., 1891. At that in
stitution he served as assistant in physics
and Instructor In electrical engineering
for two years, and. in 1S92 went abroad to
inspect the â¢ famous laboratories of Eu
rope. The following year he was appoint
ed to the chair of physics in the Univer
sity of Colorado and to the chair of elec
trical engineering there in 1895. Upon the
death of Dean Fulton of the department
of applied science ; at the same univer
sity Professor Rowe was promoted to
that position, which he retained until his
present appointment, at Stanford.
H'ONOLULU, Aug. 11.â In the four
disbarment cases that were de
cided yesterday by the Supreme
Court the judgments and com
ments of the Supreme Justices
fell heavily on the lawyers accused of en
riching themselves at the expense of aged
John K. Sumner. The decisions were:
A. S. Humphreys, disbarred; George A.
Davis, disbarred; Frank E. Thompson,
suspended for one year; J. Alfred Ma
goon, complaint discharged.
The decision of the court was an
nounced by Chief Justice Frear, Associate
Justice Galbraith dissenting in each case.
The charge against A. S. Humphreys
and F. E. Thompson was principally that
of having represented at the same time
adverse interests, and having "procured
themselves" to be Sumnef's attorneys
and accepted unduly large fees from him.
Against George A. Davis the main origi
nal accusation was that of having forced
the old man to pay him $2000 under threat
of tying up his fortune again, on a prom
issory note for $3000, which Davis is al
leged to have secured without considera
tion, though other matters were brought
up during the hearing. J. A. Magoon was
declared to have overcharged when he se
cured a fee of $4000 and to have concealed
from the court and opposing counsel the
existence of a trust deed to R. W. Davis,
which would have been an important ele
ment in the case of Ropert vs. Sumner.
The decisions were not read in full.
Chief Justice Frear and Associate Justice
Galbraith took the bench without Justice
Perry, who has been confined to his homo
for several days by illness. The Judg
ments of the court were quietly an
nounced, amid breathless silence.
In the Humphreys and Thompson case
the opinion Is by Chief Justice Frear. It
is very severe in its comment upon the
conduct and testimony of respondent
Humphreys and it Bays both went to a
"length deserving of severe censure" in
their argument in defense. Galbralth's
opinion Is equally severe, upon Magoon,
but he says that he does not concur "in
finding that the respondents were guilty
of professional misconduct and impro
priety," though not convinced that the
respondents can be properly charged with
turpitude for so doing. Galbralth says In
conclusion that in his opinion the judg
ment against Thompson is unnecessarily
â¢ severe and the judgment against Hum
. phreys is not Justified by the law or the
evidence.
The syllabus in the Magoon case was as
follows:
' "An attorney should not be punished
quasi-criminally in a proceeding for dis
barment or suspension Instituted by the
Attorney General for charging his client
a fee which the court deems excessive,
even though the client is an aged man of
: weak mind and easily influenced, when it
appears that the client is satisfied that
the attorney acted honorably and in good
faith, that he did not use threats or other
Â¦ improper methods to induce the payment
of the fee and that there is fair ground
for a difference of opinion as to the rea
sonableness of the fee."
Judgo George A. Davis was the only
man to speak. The instant that the court
had announced its decisions he arose,
walked to the clerk's desk and said:
Your Honor, I desire to take an appeal to
the Supreme Court of the United States. I
suppose that the only way 1 can bring It ud
is by a writ of error. I ask that you will al
lotf me an appca!.
"That is a matter for consideration,"
replied the Chief Justice, after a mo
ment's consultation with Associate Jus
tice Galbraith. "And it will be consid
ered when the writ is filed."
Davis then continued:
I desire to file an exception to the decision
of the court on the ground that the decision
is contrary to the evidence. It is a cruel and
unusual punishment and contrary to the pur
pose of the constitution of the United States.
to deprive me of my constitutional rights in
this manner.
Davis took his seat, but an instant
later had stepped forward and was ad
dressing the court:
I wish, further, to except to the decision of
the court on the grounds that your Honor,
Chief Justice Frear, was disqualified from sit
ting in this case. You were a trustee of thÂ«
bondholders of the Oahu Railway and Land
Company, and as such you were indirectly in

Aear Powell. ,Langley, the airship sharp, has decided that he will
take himself and his device far from the interference
of anxious and skeptical worldlings, particularly re
porters. This action on the part of Langley appears
to be the best thing he has done. It bears evidence
of an intelligence which breeds hope for the perform
ance of better things.
GORMAN IS SMOOTH
A traveler from Mexico was refused landing at this
port a few days ago on the ground that he exhibited
unmistakable marks of consumption. He explained
that his deplorable condition was due to fever and
the use of cigarettes. He submitted too much evi
dence. Had he simply pleaded the use of cigarettes
any evident disaster to his*constitution would have
been accepted as a result.
The gamblers who, in seeking an incorporation of
Colma, tried to tax the inmates of the ghostly pre
cincts of graveyards possibly saw no incongruity in
the proceeding, fortified as they are in their experi
ence in preying upon the living. The man who will
accept the bait and play a gambler's game has as
much chance as if he were dead.
Governor Taft, it is said, will be chosen Secretary
of War by President Roosevelt upon the retirement
of Secretary Root. It is evident therefore that some
times men who have rendered distinguished service
in the cause of republics are rewarded with other
than public clamor and official neglect. Governor
Taft has won his promotion.
To Americans the racial disturbances in the
Balkans have at least one feature of consolation. We
are likely to hear less of Castro for a while, and the
European powers will concern themselves with the
difficulties of their own Monroe doctrine, involved in
the vague . international theory of the balance of
power.
Â£->ENATOR INGALLS once said of Senator
Allison that if he were shod with wooden clogs
and made to run at full speed over the marble
floor of the corridors of the Capitol he would make
the race from one end of the building to the other
without making a sound loud enough to attract the
attention of any one in the building. As a Presiden
tial candidate Senator Gorman evidently intends to
make a similar record. Since his return from Eu
rope his course has been as smooth as the flow of
molasses, and every word he has uttered could be
easily worked 'up into taffy for any faction of the
Democratic party that happens to need it. s \
After the downright Cleveland and the aggressive
and uncompromising Bryan, Democracy feels the
need of a bland gentleman of quiet ways and easy
politics, and hence it is not surprising to learn that
from one end of the country to the other the fac
tion leaders are turning to Gorman with something
like a spontaneity of movement. It may be of course
that the movement is not spontaneous, for Gorman
is quite capable of working his machine without
showing the wires, but nevertheless it seems spon
taneous, for it starts equally'lrom every quarter of
the camp and tends to the common center like -a
ilock of startled &L.cc# running to ' t&e bell wether.

In these days of organization one cannot say that
such a wheat trust is impossible. It must include the
.growers of the United States, Canada, the Argen
tine, India and Russia, for they are the principal
producers. But there are many substitutes for
wheat. If the trust make it too dear the people will
eat corn, rye and barley bread and more oats. This
resort to substitutes might defeat the trust, unless
it could include them in its control. To succeed in
such a highly artificial control of the price of the
breadstuffs of the world will require more than the
genius of Rockefeller, who had one product, limited
in its supply, and of universal demand, to deal with.
How can the wheat trust be capitalized and made
international? What will be its* attitude toward
producers who are not in it? How can it set aside
successfully the law of supply and demand, which is
most stubborn in its control of the products of ag
riculture? How can it realize and get into one con
trol all the revenues of the wheat trade, the money
paid for it and make proper distribution to the pro
ducers? All these questions will have to be answered
in laying the plans for the gigantic structure it is
proposed to found on the wheat farms of the world.
Perhaps it is intended to stop short of a capital
ized trust by a universal agreement to limit produc
tion, and, by cutting the supply while the demand re
mains, affect prices. This would mean a respectful
salute to the law of supply and demand, though the
supply would be shortened artificially.
Such a scheme has been so long in the air that it
is entirely probable that it will be tried. If it suc
ceeds the world will soon see the last of free pro
duction in the foodstuffs, and also in the clothing
fibers. If wheat can be absolutely controlled by ar
tifice, every necessary of life can be controlled also,
and the trusts which will do it, composed of the ag
ricultural classes of the world, will make the pres
ent jndustrial trusts look like the proverbial thirty
cents. -, .
WHEAT corners have always failed. Some
times their projectors have made profit out
of them by timely unloading, but more
often they have proved the ruin of those attempting to
intercept the grain in transit from producer to con-
I he news comes from Warsaw that ?. new thing
may be expected in wheat. It is said that 38,000
American fanners havÂ» proposed to Russia a uni
versal wheat trust, to intlude all of the wheat-raisers
in the world and to fix a minimum price for all
wheat. A few years ago a similar proposition came
from Russia, but fixing the price was to be by
agreement between the Governments of the wheat
raising nations, just as it is now proposed to agree
upon a ratio between gold and silver, except that
the metal ratio is to be that upon which the agreeing
nations will coin it, while the price of wheat will not
be for the Governments, which do not eat it, but for
the people, who do.

Mr. Madden was pensioned last Friday,
but the action of the pension board was
not made public, and around the "Big
Yellow Building" the matter has been
kept a secret as far as possible. Presi
dent Harriman some time ago instituted
the pension system on the Southern Pa
cific Company the same as on his other
roads. The maximum age limit is seven
ty years and Mr. Madden is the first of
ficial who has been pensioned by ; the
board selected to pass on this system of
retiring.
Jerome Madden is one of thr> old school
of railroad men. He was the cljse friend
and advisor of the late Senator Stanford
and he afso stood high in the esteem of
the late Collis P. Huntington.
No circular has been issued informing
the attaches of the Southern Pacific that
Mr. Madden has been retired, but yester
day afternoon Manager Julius Krutf
schnitt confirmed the rumor that Madden
had been pensioned. Temporarily C. W.
Eberlein has been placed in charge of the
office.
Who will succeed Mr. Madden is not,
known, but Land Agent W. H. Mills of
the Central Pacific is a candidate for the
position, and is anxious to have both the
Central Pacific and the Southern Pacific
Railroad land offices consolidated.

agent of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company.

sex its highest recognition and which placed its
women under the dominion of millions of males of
every condition and degree of life, from every land
under the sun."
Six times did Mrs. Woolsey suffer "sex humilia
tion" in this country. The first occurred when as a
little girl she heard her father say that in a lawbook
he was writing he would have to record the fact that
the legal status, of the white wife in his State was
little better than that of the former negro slave;
second, when she heard a negro member of Con
gress say he was opposed to adding an amendment
to the constitution that would place white women
upon a public equality with negro men; third, when
she heard native-born American ladies Â» address a
foreign-born committee of a Legislature to plead for
their enfranchisement; fourth, when she witnessed
an emigrant legislator throw a petition which was
prese'nted by numerous American ladies to his Legis
lature into the Legislature's wastebasket with the
remark that legislators "have more important matters
to attend to than the affairs of women";* fifth, when
after paying more taxes than the .Jiirte^n colonies
were expected to pay to England in six months un
der the stamp act she was told by a foreign-born
member of Congress that the founders of the United
States republic meant that "taxation without repre
sentation is tyranny" for men only; and sixth, when
she saw a President of the United States driving
through the streets of Washington on his way to be
inaugurated and saw there was "no woman by his
side, no women in his escort, no women on the plat
form, and that the whole proceeding was one of
males, males, males."
Disgusted with her native republic, Mrs. Woolsey
sought the monarchical society of Great Britain and
there found much that pleased her. She says she
saw Victoria pass through the streets of London, and
noticed that "a state occasion in a moliarchy is not
an affair of males, males, males," for as the Queen
Empress passed along there were women in her
i coach and women in her escort. She also saw in
London that streets, parks, monuments, markets, li
braries, railway stations, theaters, ships of the navy
and regiments of the army, holidays and many other
things bore the names of women as tributes of es
teem.
Convinced by such experiences that monarchies
are more favorable to women than are republics, Mrs.
Woolsey, having been invited to address a number of
women, many of them anarchists, advised them not
to seek the overthrow of monarchical, institutions,
affd, "showed them the desperate, disheartening, cruel
sufferings which women had undergone in constitu
tional and representative governments to gain recog
nition, justice or power."
The plea is strongly made and has unquestionably
a foundation in truth. It is not to be denied that
women have in the United States much to gain be
fore they will have all that they merit or which will
be theirs in an ideal condition of society; but none
the less there is an enormous fallacy involved in the
conclusion that the position of woman in the United
States is worse than her position in any country of
the Old World. Mrs. Woolsey's argument is- a plea
for the aristocratic woman, for the grand lady born
to purple and wealth and longing for precedence and
social preferment. It is much the same plea that
Waldorf Astbr would make in defence of his choice
of England as a home. This is not a good land for
persons of aristocratic pretensions, whether men or
women, and those who wish recognition of such pre
tensions must go abroad. In. a democracy such as
exists here there must be always many crudities and
some absurdities, but none the less the rank in the
world which the American woman holds both indus-'
trially and socially is a conclusive proof that her
energiesare given more freedom here than any
where else on the globe.
MRS. KATE T. WOOLSEY, author of "Repub
lics Versus Women," has contributed to the
current North American a savage onslaught
against what she regards as the injustice done to
women by republics, and especially by this country.
She says, indeed, "the United States republic is a
monstrous regimen of men â a strictly masculine
monopoly, a purely male oligarchy"; and after
stating that she is descended on both sides from colo
nial ancestors who took up arms for the right of
self-government, she adds: "I decided that 1 would
not be a worthy descendant of my progenitors if I
did not rebel against a government which refused my

AN OLD DATE â Subscriber, City.
April 4, 1SS*. fell on a Tuesday.
GOVERNOR DURBIN of Indiana in reply
ing to President Roosevelt's letter on the
frequency of lynching outrages in this coun
try and the need "of a more resolute enforcement of
law says: "Your stirring words will' serve to press
home upon the people a responsibility which, reach
ing beyond all those in authority, is after all essen
tially their own. To arouse the realization of that
responsibility and all that it implies will be to eradi
cate conditions which otherwise may soon become,
as you point out so cleverly, an imminent menace to
the very life of the republic."
Approval of the President's address has been given
South as well as North, as . might have been ex
pected, for the issue is national and not sectional.
For example, no one has been more prompt to
commend the letter than Governor Terrell of Geor
gia, who in a statement to the Associated Press said:
"I think President Roosevelt is on the right line,
and I am in heart}' accord with the views he ex-
The only person of note who has spoken in support
of lynch' law is a certain John Temple Graves
of Atlanta, who at a recent Chautauqua assem
bly said of lynching: "It is here. It is here
to stay. Place here as the premise and postulate
of your reasoning that lynching will never hereafter
be discontinued in this republic until the crime
which provokes it is destroyed. This is a fact, not a
theory-. It is not as it ought to be, but it is as it is,
and it surely will be. * * * We might as well
state the question fairly. The problem of the hour
is not how to prevent lynching in the South, but the
larger question, how shall we destroy the crime
which always has and always will provoke the lynch
ing? When we reach this statement of the question
we have made some progress; not before."
When placing that "premise and postulate" be
fore the Chautauquans Mr. Graves cunningly sought
to induce them to believe that the crime which pro
vokes lynching is that of assault by negroes upon
! white women. The innuendo, however, fails of effect
in the face of reports given by the press of various
lynching outrages. In some cases negroes have been
lynched for no other offense than that of seeking an
j opportunity to work. In other instances they have
been put to death solely because they were negroes.
Again, in several of the outrages the victims were
not negroes, but white men, and finally in repeated
instances of lynching committed by "Whitecaps" in
the Mississippi Valley States the victims of the lynch
ers were white women.
Graves has evidently started in to out-Tillman Till
raan himself, but his plea will have no effect beyond
that of inflaming a little more the lawless spirit that
is ever eager to commit crimes of violence and to
overthrow law whenever it can do so with impunity.
The great masses of the American people are^ no
longer interested in any discussion as to whether
lynch law is or is not justifiable. They have made
up their minds on that point, and their concern in the
problem now is solely that of determining how to
provide an effective remedy for the evil.
President Roosevelt said: "We must show that
the law is adequate to deal with crime by freeing it
from every vestige of technicality and delay." Gov
ernor Terrell emphasizes the same point, saying:
"The majesty of the law should be upheld, but at
the same time there should be prompt and speedy
trial of the offenders in the case of that crime which
most frequently excites the anger of mobs and leads
to lynchings, and the punishment should not be de
layed by technicalities." Justice Brewer of the
Supreme Court has recommended the same remedy,
saying: "One thing needed to stay this epidemic of
b-nching is the establishment of a greater confidence
in the summary and certain punishment of the crimi
nal. Men are afraid of the law's delays and the un
certainty of its results. Not that they doubt the in
tegrity of the Judges, but they know that the law
abounds with technical rules and that appellate
courts will often reverse a judgment or conviction
for a disregard of such rules, notwithstanding a full
belief in the guilt of the accused. If all were cer
tain that the guilty ones would be promptly tried
and punished, the inducement to lynch would be
largely taken away."
Statements of that kind coming from the Presi
dent, from Governors and from a Justice of the Su
preme Court may be accepted as convincing- proof
that there is needed a more prompt enforcement of
the criminal law. Still it will be borne in mind that
in most cases where lynch law has been resorted to
no member of the mob could, have had any doubt
that the guilty party would have been promptly pun
ished by the courts. Governor Durbin, speaking of
the mobs in Indiana, said: "There could be no
reasonable complaint either of the executive or of
the courts in this State on the ground of the non
enforcement of the law." A similar statement might
be truthfully made in almost every State where I
lynching has been frequent. In fact, lynching is no
more nor less than downright lawlessness and an
archy, and the only remedy for it is the enforcement
of law against lynchers as well as against other crim
inals.

New Novels of This
Money-Mad World
THE world is money mad. That statement looks absolutely start-
ling in cold type, but when you realize that it is a sentiment em-
~ anatine from the foremost political and financial economists of the
world it is time to becin to sit up and take notice. If you doubt its
truth just take a casual glance at the popular literature of the hour.
You will invariably find that the theme is wealth, and more wealth, and
yet again more wealth â wealth in the spending even as much as wealth
in the making. Not the fairy tale lore of wealth of bygone ages, but
modern wealth that has to do with empire building, the destiny of na-
tions, the struggle for commercial dominance and aristocratic social su-
premacy of the men and women of the hour. yea. almost of the yerr
minute, so vast and so rapid is the rise and fall of the bureauocracv of
' wealth. No more the tales of buried treasure of picturesque pirates or
lost mines and enchanted palaces stored with riches, but the gold that
glitters before our very eyes â rich, yellow gold that we watch in the
making â gold v that is accumulated while you wait by men we all know,
and spent with greater ease and facility, by women who are better
known.
Of such a dozen books that everybody is reading right now might
be mentioned at random. To begin with there is "The Soender3."
whicfi is concluded in the Sunday Call to-day, and which not only show*
the excitement of modern monev\ mak ing. but the more subtle art of
spending it. Then there is "The Octopus." Frank Norris' famous tale
of the bnilding of vast wealth, and his later book, "The Pit." which tells
of the awful struecle to corner that same vast wealth. Then there are
"The Autocrat." "The Thirteenth District." "Tainted Gold." "The Mis-
sissippi Bubble." etc. etc. . Indeed the list might be swelled indefinitely
But of all these novels none are quite like unto that verv latest
creation. "Brewster's Millions." In point of fact "Brewster's Millions"
is absolutely unlike anything that has ever been written before, for in it
a perfectly adorable younjr fellow has to spend a million a year, eet his
money's worth and yet have absolutely nothing to show for it at the
i d of that time in order -that he may inherit six million more. Sounds
fascinating, doesn t it? Well, it is more than that. â¢ r
Now you may think it is the easiest thing in the world to spend a
million. Never tried it. of course. But wait . until you have read
"Brewsters Millions, which begins in the next Sunday Call, and you
will see what a stupendous task it is to spend a million a vearâ actually
spend it â notv dissioate it or jrive it away or lose it in false speculation,
but get your money's worth as you would if you had only a hundred in-
stead of a cool million.
But the popular craze of literature' of the bright snappy, uo-to-date
sort goes even further than this. Never before was there such a tre-
mendous demand for short stories of thr best sort. And what better
reading conld you get? A srood short story is a complete novel in con-
densed form, and it is iust such e-rrellent reading as this that is pro-
vided in the Sunday', Call's new "Half Hour Storiettes." of which, next
Sunday, you will get two full page*. Here are some of the titles:
"Mysterious Leofric." "In the F'-Â»<h of Strioed Death." 'The Secret of
the Jamaica Sink Hole?' "The Beautiful MÂ»m Marrhm." "FaWes for
the Foolish." "Shortv Mahan's Passing." "Love*Â« Golden Tether "
"While the Train Waited." "Wh*t TÂ«*ny Peter Did." etc.. etc. Be3t of
all there is a new short story by A. Cnnan Dovle. 'The Shadow Be-
fore"; "Millions in His Dreams." by MaÂ»V Twain: "Me-ows of a Kitty"
by Kate Thyson Marr ; 'The Oracle of Mulberry Center." by S. E. Kiser

The Mayor submits copies of corre
spondence had With the company asking
for a selling figure and he adds that no
proposition or bid has been received in
response to his requests.
Taking up the Bay Cities Water Com
pany project, the Mayor -writes that in
April he received an offer from the com
pany to deliver <vater at $50 per million
gallons a day, or 5 cents a thousand gal
lons # at the southern boundary of the
city' 'But this plan fell through because
the company's attorneys held that a con
tract to supply water could, not be made
binding on the city to compel i. to take
the water at a fixed, unchanged rate. The
second proposition to sell a plant outright
was then submitted by the company and
if. is included in the Mayor's message.
The annual expense entailed upon the
citv of Oakland through the acquisition
and operation of the plant under consid
eration is estimated by '. Chief Engineer
Duryea of Â¦ the . company at 532a,000, viz.:
Interest on $3,750,000 bonds at 4 per cent,
$150,000; operation, $100,000; maintenance,
$50,000;' other expenses, $25,000.
The annual capacity of the plant (20,
000,000x365) Is seven thousand three hun
dred million gallons, and the cost to Oak
land delivered at elevations which will,
properly supply a gravity pressure dis
tributing system therein, figures out $44 52
per million gallons.
WHAT IS CONTEMPLATED.
This contemplates the building of a ter
minal reservoir of twenty to thirty mil
lion gallons capacity, the. city, however,
to install its distributive system.
.The Mayor says of the proposition:
The Bay Cities Water Company offers to sell
a sufficient rese^oir for the storage of eight
thousand five hundred million gallons of water
and water rights capable of yielding that
amount of water per year, together with a suf
ficient pipe line to the southerly limits of the
city â¢ of Oakland, and there to erect and : deed
to the city a sufficient pumping plant, with
pipe lines to reservoir, to be selected by the
city within its limits .to, elevate "the: water -to
a sufficient height for the city's, purposes for
the sum of $3,750,000. , W,
If the city should, elect to install another
plant of its own, independent of the Contra
Costa Water Company, it should, in my opin
ion pay to the Contra Costa Water Company
a liberal sum for Its distributing system with
in the city and continue to pay the present
high rate for water during the period that
the city is Installing the new plant.
The course of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany has not been such as to recommend it
to the people of Oakland, bur the t>eople of
Oakland desire to avoid dolnir an Injustice to
any one If the Contra Costa 'Water Com
pany will sell to the city of Oakland as much
of Its plant as the city needs I recommend
the city to buy provided the price Is not
unreasonably high. If the corporation will
not sell its property outside the city limits
for a fair valuation then the city should pay
a liberal price for its distributing system
within the city limits. If the corporation
will not sell that distributing system at such
price the city should not allow itself to be
held up but should install a plant tf its own.
My own opinion Is that if the city pays
$3 500.000 for the property of the Contra Costa
Water Company It will be paying a suf
ficiently liberal price. If It pays to the Contra
Costa Water Company $1,500,000 for the dis
tributive system within the city limits speci
fied by Mr. Fitzgerald and agrees to continue
the Dresent high rate for the period of three
years no Injustice will be done by the city
to that corporation.
CORRESPONDENCE SUBMITTED.
It is not difficult to ascertain what the
value of the lands owned by tl.e Contra Coata
Water Company, and necessary to the opera
tion of Its plant, is, for the nurposes for
which said land Is suitable other than for
reservoir purposes. It Is not possible that
such lands, lor ordinary purposes, would bring
the valuation cf the plant upon Mr. Fitz
gerald's estimates, up to $3,000,000.
Therefore if the city of Oaklind elects to
install a water plant of its own it will thereby
practically destroy a large part of the value
of the Contra Costa Water Company's plant,
while at the game time the Contra Costa Water
Company will be compelled to continue Its
supply to the people of Oakland at the rates
fixed by the City Council for watar during the
period that must elarise between making such
election and the completion of It3 own water
works, say for three years.
VALUES TOO HIGH.
port places a value only on that uortlon of
the Contra Costa Water Company's plant that,
in the opinion of Mr. Frtzgerald. ts necessary
for the use of Oakland. That corporation also
supplies Alameda, Berkeley, Frultvale and San
Leandro. This fact should be kept con
stantly in mind in these discussions of value
of its property within- the city limits, aa well
as much of the property of the company out
side the city.
2â If the Contra Costa Water Company will
not sell the entire plant specified in Mr Fitz
gerald's report, but will sell its distributing
system within the city limits at an'approxi
mately fair valuation the city should buy
This recommendation is made also, not be
cause we want or need the present water dis
tributive system, but is made because If car
ried out. it will end all controversy. Our City
Engineer has made, at your . request, very
careful - estimates of the cost of a first-class
distributive system, including reservoirs and
meters. The pipe is of castlron, the most
expensive and durable known, and of. capacity
equal tc the needs of a city i of .120,000 people.
Tbe estimated cost at present prices of labor
and material Is $1,080,000. If the estimated
coet of meters Is deductedâ $164, 100^-the total
cost of this up to date and modern plant for
distribution Is $1,832,800. , Irrespective of all
considerations : except economic ones, such a
plant Is cheaper at the price stated than the
estimate placed on the water, company's plant
by Mr. Fitzgerald.
Â¦ > 8â In ' the event - that the > water company
refuses to sell its plant at the price indicated
within ten days from date,. then I. recommend
that the s engineer of the city be required to
report within the next twenty-five days there
after whether or not. ; in his opinion, the Bay
Cities Water Company has the ability to fur
nish the city ' from the proposed watershed a
quantity of water equal to a daily supply o f
80,000,000 gallons. . and whether the proposed
Mayor Olney treats at some length on
the Niles Cone project, which has already
had exhaustive consideration in the citi
zens' committee, of five report. He pre
sents that source as a last alternative
Summing up. Mayor Olney writes:
After a survey of the whole field my recom
mendations are as follows: ' tom
1â If the, Contra Costa Water Company vin
sell so much of its plant as is Included in
Mr. Fitzgerald's report for a price not ex
ceedlng $3,600,000. the city ought to buy r
do not recommend such purchase because i
believe the property Is worth the amount sDec
lfled, but because such purchase la In the in
terest of peace and quiet. In my opinion
the proposition of the Bay Cities' Water Com
panyls. from the standpoint of economy and
actual money values, better than the purchase
of . the' Contra Costa Water Company's plant
for $6.000000. The Bay Cities' Wafer Coâ¢'
pany will furnish, for a moderate price,
enough jvater of a better quality than that
furnlahed from San Leandro reservoir to sup
ply Oakland for many years to come. The
supply of water from the San Leandro reser
voir is limited, and the quality is not of
the best. All additional supplies must come
from the Mies cone, and the rights of the
water company there are not exclusive. The
city is as free to get water there aa is the
water company.
NILES PLAN BEVIEWED.
But as the corporation anticipates bitter
opposition from its rivals already in the field
it desires, for business reasons, that Its pror>
erty and Its plans, etc.. be not published until
euch time as this Council approves its proDo
sltlon and Is ready to submit to the people thw
question of iasuinjt bonds. fropie m*
At the earnest solicitation of the corporation
I have consented to that portion of their prop
osition that the plans and specifications their
maps, etc. of water shed shall not be submit
ted to public Inspection until after there has
been a favorable report by our engineers and
the people are called upon to vote upon tha
proposition. If the engineers report favorably
and this Council Is of opinion that the proiw
sltion ought to be accepted and proposes to the
people a bond issue to carry it out, then all
the plans . and specifications, description of
water shed, etc., are to be laid before the peo
ple of Oakland for their consideration so thAt
they can act intelligently in voting for or
against the issuance of bonds.
SUPPLY VERY LARGE.
Twenty millions of gallons of water daily
is more than the city of Oakland will require
for many years to come, but it is sound ek>1
icy to secure that supply at once if it can be
done for the price proposed by the Bay Cities
Water Company. The Contra Costa Water
Company claims that It has furnished the citv
of Oakland a dally supply of twelve or more
million gallons of water. It seems incredible
that any such quantity of water could be
consumed by a population In the neighborhood
When it is considered that the Spring Valle7
Water Works of San Francisco claims that a
supply of water costs in the neighborhood of
one million dollars for every million gallons
of daily supply, making, according to the esti
mates of that corporation, a daily supply to
the city of Oakland of 20,000,000 gallons, worth
the sum of $20,000,000, and when It is consid
ered that the estimates of other engineers are
to the effect that a supply of water in great
quantities will cost about eight hundred thou
sand dollars for every million gallons fur
nished daily, it will be seen what a remark
able contrast there is between the prices pro
posed by thÂ»; Bay Cities Water Company and
anything heretofore considered as a basis of
calculation for the cost.

5 The question of the issue of bonds to
acquire a municipal water plant by the city
shouid be submitted to the people Just as soon
as It is settled what system is to bo adopted.
In the event that the Contra Costa Water
Company consents to sell, the bonds for the
water plant should be in the sum of $3,500,000
for that plant and about J250.000 for improve
ments in that plant, particularly In its dlstrib-
Ut In 6 the* event the Contra Costa Water Com

of bonds in the sum of $2,000,000 with which

neers reporting favorably on the Bay Cities
Water Company's proposal, a bond Issue for
13 750 000 with which to purchase that plant;
but If the report is unfavorable, then for an
issue of about $1,600,000 to acquire land on
the Niles cone, erect pumping plants, lay pipe
Iif* reviewing all these different schemes of
water supply I have no hesitation whatever in
saying that the best of all. from the economic
point of view, and keeping in mind' the cer
tainty of an Immense Increase in the wealth
and population of our city. Is the one proposed
by the Bay Cities Water Company. .
The corporation Is a responsible one. IU
president and leading stockholder is Mr. Wil
liam S Tevls. His financial standing you all
know He is. without doubt, absolutely cer
tain of being able to supply us with more
than 20 000,000 gallons of water per day, and
will be 'one of the bondsmen on the f 1.000,000
guarantee bond. This bond, however, will not
bo to the extent of guaranteeing from the
watershed a continuous dally supply of 20,000
000 gallons, for that would be a guaranty
mralnst a succession of droughts that might
cut off all water supplies. Therefore, our en
gineers must tell us whether, judging from
the records of the last twenty-thrte years, the

B0NI> QUESTION VITAL.
The attention of occupants of adjoining
rooms was attracted by a noise and blew
their police whistles. Before the police
responded a man was seen running: from
the place. "When officers entered they
found the woman lying; dead upon the
floor. A towel had been tightly twisted
around h*Â»r neck and her skull had been
crushed in in several places with a large
boulder, which was found lying near the
body. The contents of the drawers of a
dresser in the room were scattered on
the floor, indicating that robbery was the
motive, but on the dead woman's fingers
were several valuable rings and on her
wrists several bracelets, showing that the
murderer was looking: only for money.
The woman arrived here three weeks
ago from San Francisco. But little Is
known of her here.

Action was taken by the Board of Su

the building of the scenic boulevard from
Oakland to Haywards along the crest
of the Contra Costa hills. This drive will
be thirteen miles in .length and it is -es
timated that it will cost from $200,000 to
$250,000.
A resolution unanimously adopted by the
board makes provision "to acquire and
construct the road In the most substan
tial-manner and in the shortest time con
sistent with reasonable taxation, as pro
vided in section 2643 of the Political
Code."
It Is believed that the construction of

by the Board" of Trade, Merchants* Ex

view to^ having such a driveway as will

The reverses of that mine consumed all
his money and left him a poor man, old,
destitute and too proud to ask for char
ity.
Assion in his more prosperous days
owned and built the property on Third
street between Folsom and Harrison, but
later was compelled to out.
It was a house which Assion himself
had built that he was compelled to leave,
taking with him his few belongings, to
live with his sister, Mrs. Fehrenbaeh,
who is a poor woman.
Assion's wife died nine months ago. He
leaves no children.
Joseph Assion. a pioneer and former
wealthy merchant tailor of this city, com
mitted suicide shortly after 6 o'clock yes
terday morning by jumping from the
deck of the steamer Encinal.
The steamer was returning on her regu
lar trip from Alameda. when a passenger
notified Patrick McGratn, second mate of
the boat, that a man on the saloon
deck was acting suspiciously. McGrath
went to the deck and watched the pas
senger for a short time. McGrath states
that he turned his back for a moment,
whereupon the man he was watching
sprang over the rail Into the bay.
McGrath, with the assistance of Deck
hands John Carlson, Peter George and
Ernest Holenberg, lowered a boat and
made ah effort to save the unfortunate
man. After some moments the body was
recovered, but life was extinct.
In the pockets of the deceased were
found a quantity of rocks and iron.
On reaching the city the remains were
removed to the Morgue, where they were
identified as those of Joseph Assion, who
resided at 34SH Third street.
In tha saloon at 34S Third street As
sion had left a note addressed to his sis
ter, Mrs. M. Fehrenbaeh, who resides at
12 Godens street, stating that despond
ency and the loss of all he had were the
causes of his death.
Joseph Assion was S3 years of age. Hej
was a native of Germany, and came to
this city in '19, when he engaged in busi
ness as a merchant tailor and accumu
lated a small fortune. Several years ago
he retired from business and with his
wealth purchased a large share in the
Champion mine, of which he became a di
rector.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 17.â Two ordinances
< rnbecying the stipulations recommended
I y ihe citizens' committee of fifty upon
v.hich the Southern. Pacific will be offered
the two local franchls-es it seeks werÂ« in
irodaced at the meeting of the City Trus
icea to-night.
City Trustee William M. Bowers intro
duced both measures and said that he did
. o to get matters under way in order that
â¢ie agitation might be ended to the gen
t ral satisfaction of all concerned. Copies
ot the ordinances as submitted will be i
:orvvarded to the management of the
southern Pacific and it will then be in
Â¦.tier for the representatives of the com
. .: y to confer with the City Trustees if |
Ihey desire any alterations or amendments
i;â de to the documents.
-\o one appeared to-night on behalf of
;..-j Southern Pacific, aitnough it was ei-
I toted tha.t the management would enter
n. withdrawal of its application for a fran
chise en the north side line. As intro
duced to-night, the ordinances require the
Southern Pacific to pay into the city |
tnasnry $5Cv a month; $200 for the north
tide franchise and J330 for the south side I
franchise.
FIXES LOCAL TABE.
The ordinances grant the franchises for
twenty-five years; stipulate that the
Southern Pacific shall establish a 2Vt cent
local fare, and that AJameda shall be
given all the advantages of a tormina]
I Assenger and freight point.
There was also fiied with the City Trus
tees to-night a petition requesting that
body not to grar.t to any person or cor
poration franchises to operate steam roads
within the municipal limits. The peti
tioners are opposed to steam roads, claim
ing that the eraoke, vibrations and other
nuisances caused by them decrease the
value of realty to one-half the value of
property on streets where -electric cara
are operated. The petition concludes:
'"Should your honorable body grant any
fteam road franchises we will feel that
our rights have been invaded."
Another petition requesting the City
Trustees to call a epeeial election to have
voters pass on the terms upon which the
franchises should be granted was read
and referred to the city attorney to ren
der a written opinion to the City Trustees
ef to whether the local referendum or
dinance ie mandatory or not.
MAGCTRE PROTESTS.
Kx-Congresemaa James G. Maguire ap
peared before the City Trustees on behalf
&t Herman Eppinger Jr.. who, with Rob
ert B. Mott, made application for the local
franchisee, offering to pay a bonus of
510,000 for the same. Maguire said that
Eppinger took exception to the manner
In which his offer had been treated by the
â¢ itizens' auvisory committee of fifty and
the way in which members of that body
had investigated and reported upon the
r.nancial standing of Eppinger.
Maguire denied that Eppinger was In
>r.y way connected with the firm of that
i.ame which recently made a disastrous
failure in San Frar.cisco. Mapuire as
strici that Erping-er considered the
Statements made by members of the citl-

I have taken into consideration the fact cf
the inadequacy of the distributive system with
in the city of Oakland and I have also taken
into consideration the fact that it can be
made effective by the I*-/ng of mains to re
inforce different portions of the system. The
estimate Is exclusive ot stock oa hand, real
estate, rights of way and questions of equity.
MANY THINGS CONSIDERED.
Temcscal Lake has been omitted from the
estimate for the reason that it may properly
be retained by th* company for the supply
of Dortions of its works outside the limits of
the city of Oakland.
Claremont reservoir in Berkeley has been
included in the estimate, for the reason that
It U required to equalize the supply of, the
mains feeding a large and growing district
within the limits of Oakland. Parts of thÂ»
distributive system belonging to the Contra
Costa Water Company outside of Oakland have
been Included in the estimate, for the reason
that they belong topographically and logically
to the Dortlcns of the company's plant in
cluded in my instructions. They comprise
principally the distributive systems for the
supply of communities in Alameda ' County
along the lines of the mains included in the
estimate. The Piedmont tunnels and Sausal
Creek supplies have not been included.
In accordance with the Instructions I have
made the following estimate of the value of
certain portions of the works belonging to the
Contra Ccsta. Water Company's system.
It has seemed necessary to depart in some
respects from the Â«trict letter of the instruc
tions, but in the main thÂ«y have been fol
lowed. Â¦ ,
GETTING AT VALUES.
In his letter of instructions to Expert
Fitzgerald the Mayor asked him to deter
mine the actual cash value of the system
In Oakland, taking Into consideration that
there is no exclusive franchise for laying
pipes. He was to consider the adequacy
or Inadequacy of the system for supply
ing the city, and to work on the general
lines that the company claims it can dis
connect its sources of supply to Alameda
and Berkeley from Oakland.
In his report Engineer Fitzgerald said:
The Mayor reviewed the legal aspects
of the water rates suit, and explained
that Expert Desmond Fitzgerald had
been engaged as a skilled and, outside
expert to make an unbiased appraise
ment of the company's plant, and adds:
Mr. Fitzgerald was told that If there were
any equities as between the Contra Costa
Water Company and the City of Oakland he
was not called upon to pass upon them, but
that we would adjust that matter ourselves.
He was also told that, so far as the value of
the land used by the Contra Costa Water Com
pany is concerned, outside and Independent of
He Increased value for reservoir purposes, 'we
cculd pass upon that question here in Califor
nia without the necessity of his making any
inquiries and examining Into it himself. What
was impressed upon him waÂ» that we wanted
him to fix a valuation of the plant of the Contra
Costa Water Company that would Include the
water rlehts and the Increased value of the
land over and above ordinary purposes for
which land is used, such as farming or grazing
purposes, because of its suitableness for a res
ervoir site, and alpo any value that the plant
might have by reason of its being a going
concern.
It is necessary to take the Contra Costa
Water Company Into consideration in discuss
ing any scheme for Introducing water into our
city. That corporation is now supplying, and
for many years last past has supplied, the city.
Its pipes are laid in cur streets, it has valua
ble water rights and property and if it will
sell out Its plant* for what It Is actually worth,
preference should be jjiven It. for the reason
that It Is now a going concern. The price that
it hae heretofore put upon its plant and the
value of that plant as fixed by Judge Hart, has
been and is. In the opinion of our people and
of myself, absurdly high. *
The company provides that the city's
engineers shall have forty-five days in
which to examine the plans, water Bhed,
etc, and a similar time In which to re
port to the City Council. Â¦
The proposal means to sell an equipped
plant outright to the city.
It is recommended that the question of
the issue of bonds to acquire a munici
pal water plant by the city should be
submitted to the people just as soon as
it is settled what system is to be adopt
ed. If the Contra Costa Water Company
purchase be favored, he recommends a
call for $3,500,000 plus $250,000 for* improve
ments In the plant. If the Bay Cities
Water Company proposal be ifavored an
issue of $3,750,OuO will be required, or if
the Niles cone plan is adopted an Issue
of $1,500,000 will be necessary at the out
set to purchase land, etc.
CONTRA COSTA NOT IGNORED^,
At the outset the message thus speaks
of the Contra Costa- Water Company:
Accompanying the Mayor's message to
night was a proposal from the Bay Cities
Water Company, with plans and specifica
tions for a water supply plant. The pro
posal is signed by the following officers
and directors of the corporation:
William S. Tevts, president; Clinton E. "Wor
den, vice president; Frank G. Drum, treasurer;
E. G. Wheeler, secretary; Carroll N. Beal, gen
eral manarer; Harry L. Tevls, capitalist;
Wakeflsld Baker, president Baker & Hamilton:
Mark L. Requa, president Pacific Steel and
Wire Company, and James W. Byrne, capi
talist.
Third, the Mayor recommends its pur
chase of lands in the Niles cove, or gravel
beds, and the construction of pumping sta
tion and pipe lines.
These three major propositions are made
contingent upon each other. His Honor
gives the Contra Costra "Water Company
ten days from date In which to accept the
offer. He also recommends that the city's
engineer be given twenty-five days in
which to report on the ability of the Bay
Cities Water Company to fulfill Its pro
posed plans. In the event of failure here
the Niles cone project Is to be taken. But
in his recommendation the Mayor said
he included the Contra Costa Water Com
pany purchase, not because he thought
it worth $3,500,000, but to forever end the
litigation and turmoil in that quarter.
He adds that he believes the proposal of
the Bay Cities Water Company to be the
best from an economic point of view.
INCLUDES EXPERT'S REPORT.
The Mayor includes in his message the
report of Expert Desmond Fitzgerald on
the value of the Contra Costa Water Com
pany plant. Mr. Fitzgerald places his fig
ures at $2,6S9,1S5. as the actual cash value
of the water distributive system of the
company in iiie city of Oakland.
The estimate is exclusive of stock on
hand, real estate, rights of way and ques
tions of equity.
First, the Mayor recommends the pur
chase of the Contra Costra'Water Com
pany's plant for not more than $3,500,000.
Second, he urges the proposal of the Bay
Cities Water Company, which controls
watersheds another drains in the moun
tains south of Alameda County, to sell
the city an equipped plant at the southern
boundary of Oakland supplying 20,000,000
gallons of water daily for $3,750,000. To
this add $1,832,000 for a distributing sys
tem, as estimated by City Engineer F.
C. Turner.

The Board of Works notified the Board
of Supervisors yesterday that It would de
cline to Issue a permit in accordance with
a resolution of the latter board granting
Pioneer Automobile Company permission
to construct a 4-story frame building: 54%
feet in height on the southwest corner of
Golden Gate avenue and Octavia street.
The communication says :
This revolution is in conflict with ordinance
No. 045 of your honorable body, which limits
the height of this particular class of buildings
to fifty feet.
The City Attorney on August 10, 1903, ad
vised this board that there is no power In
the Board of Supervisors to make laws deny
ing a privilege to the people at larse and
granting to one or more Individuals the right
to disobey the general law.
The Board of Public Works I* of the opin
ion that the ceneral law should be compiled
with in Jill cases, and therefore does not feel
justified in issuing to said Pioneer Automobile
Company a permit to proceed with the con
struction of fold building.

Violates Ordinance Limiting

DECLINES TO COMPLY
WITH A RESOLUTION
Electric arc lights were ordered in
stalled at Paris and Russia streets, China
and Edinburgh streets and ' Sanchez and
Valler streets.
The ordinance authorizing the Coroner
to appoint a morgufti keeper at a salary
of $75 per month was passed to print.
The Board of Works, sent-a communica
tion to the effect. that before proceeding
with the removal of obstructions from
Twenty-seventh avenue South, between
Charter Oak and Railroad avenues, in
the University Mound and Bay View dis
tricts, the board should determine what
right, if any, the city has to the use of
the land for street purposes. More than
half of the land is claimed as private
property and the claimants are paying
taxes on the same. A survey to serve as
a guide in removing the. obstructions to
the approximate avenue lines would cost
$75.
The ordinances providing for the full
acceptance' of New Montgomery street
from Market to Howard, and Hyde street,
between Greenwich and Lombard, were
passed to print.
An expenditure of $1472 was authorized
in payment to the Howard Estate for
eight horses for use in the Fire Depart
ment.
The resolution authorizing an expen
diture of $1000 out of the general fund in
payment to Chief Engineer D. T. Sulli
van of the Fire Department to defray his
transportation expenses to the annual
convention of the International Associa
tion of Fire Engineers, to be held at At
lantic City, N. J., September 8, 9, 10 and
11, 1903, was passed to print.
The Mayor's veto of the authorization
of $517 for two horses bought by the
Health Board for the Almshouse, on the
ground that the price is excessive, was
referred to the, Health Committee.
Pursuant to the written nomination of
the Justices of the Peace and in conform
ity with the provisions of the act of the
Legislature approved March 25, 1903, the
board appointed George S. McComb Jus
tices'- Clerk. The vote on the resolution
was unanimous.

But there Is a matter which must not bÂ«
overlooked. When the Government entered
into a - contract with the Union Iron Works
to build certain war vessels, it was provided
by the contract that It was unassignable. In
the conveyance of Its property to defendant,
this Government contract "and any Â»nd all
sums due or to become due . thereunder" were
expressly excepted. in the deed of conveyance,
from its operation. By the testimony It ap
pears that this exception was a condition
precedent to the sale. The defendant took the
property subject to this burden, and Its suc
cessor, the receiver, must do the same "With
out entering into any discussion of the law
upon this subject, I do not doubt that the
Union Iron Works should retain the posses
sion of the entire plant until these Govern
ment contracts are fully completed. If this
were not done, it Is probable that the Gov
ernment would take and retain the possession
of the entire plant until It could finish the
vessels. This, In my opinion, would be un
profitable to the Government, most disastrous
to defendant's Interests, and, if there Is any
profit in the contracts, it would be lost to the
Union Iron Works. Therefore, for the pro
tection of the Government and the enforcement
of its contracts with the Union Iron Works
the latter may retain the possession of the
entire* property and plant until It shall have
completed the vessels provided for by Its said
contracts -with the Government; that subject
to this provision, James Smith Jr. of Newark
N. J.. is appointed receiver of all the property
effects, and assets of every kind, of the de
fendant, situated within the Jurisdiction of this
court; but his possession and right thereto must
be only of such modified character as In no
way to Â¦ Interfere with or retard the Union
Iron Works in the performance of Us said con
tracts with the Government. At all tiroes this
property and the receiver In his relation to It
shall be subject to such orders as to this court
shall seem best. â¢, >
WAR VESSEL CONTRACTS.
Much has been said concerning the Inter
ests of the Union Iron Works. What Inter
ests lias It? Certainly it has been a great
corporation; it has had an honorable career,
it has established an enviable credit â it built
the Oregon. But what Is it now? On the Sth
day of August. 1002. it sold to the United
States Shipbuilding Company all Its realty,
plants, machinery, stock, money, and every
thing it possessed, reserving nothing except Its
contracts with the Government, which It could
not ase>lgn.' and it took from defendant a leane 1
for one year on all the property, and that has
expired. The title to all that it once owned
has passed by deed from defendant to James
Smith Jr., as receiver. I am unable to com
prehend what interests the Union Iron Works
possesses which the court can protect, save
Its Interest in certain Government contracts,
in which Its manager, Henry T. Scott, says
the profit Is but nominal. While willing to
protect any Interests It may ha\ r e. nothing
tanKible appears for protection.- It has a re
spectable name, but its condition seems to
be that of genteel poverty.
Ui*>n the other hand, the complainants!
claiming that great frauds have been com
mitted upon them and other security holders
in both the organization and management of
the corporation, represent that the receiver
already appointed is competent and honor
able, and that ho will uproot the frauds and
put the defendant corporation upon a sub
stantial financial basis. The court desires that
If frauds have been committed, they be re
vealed, and that those who Â¦ perpetrated them
shall reap therefrom only disappointment. To
this end whatever aldlt can extend to the re
ceiver, should be given. It may be added, that
if the deed which he now holdÂ« to the property
as receiver does not protect It from attach
ment and other legal process, his appointment
by this court would do so.
As to the injury that the other side al
lege might be done to the property by
the appointment Judge Beatty says:
FAME IS FLEETING.
After quoting numerous authorities to
the effect that the court has jurisdiction
to appoint a receiver the opinion goes on
to say: * -\ .
It is, however, said that the malfeasance of
the officer does not authorize the court to ap
point a receiver, and authorities are produced
which support that proposition. We then
have a corporation shown to be. insolvent, and,
admitting the truth of the charges, that its
officers, through mismanagement and mal
feasance, have brought it to the collapsing
point; that .there is imminent danger that its
estate will be lost to Its security holders; that
while the appointment of th* receiver was
lawful, his hands are paralyzed: that the court
being without power to stay the wrecking of
the corporation or protect its stockholders,
must stand by, leaving the weak to the greed
of the strong. A court of chancery would
yield to such view only when overwhelmed by
authority. The authorities are not uniform,
but time to review them will not be taken.
It is not assumed that all complainants'
charges are true, but they have been made in
four other courts, each of which has granted
complainants' prayer. Moreover, that in less
than a year after its organization the defend
ant is unable to meet Its liabilities, and seems
to be upon the verge of dissolution. Is sugges
tive that very great derelictions, or very treat
frauds, or both. In its organization or in its
management, or in both, are chargeable to its
officers and manipulators. It started with es
tablished operating plants in a time of, such
activity and prosperity that from every mill,
from every Industrial plant in the country
managed with even ordinary skill and some
honesty, streams of wealth have flowed un
equaled in the history of Industrial pursuits;
and yet this company has totally failed. Thesa
facts, with those appearing from different
sources during this hearing. Justify a pre
sumption of the truth of complainants' asser
tions. They at least admonish to the exercise
of care that chicanery under the pretense of
financiering shall not be encouraged and that
the wrong may be aided in righting their
wronrs. ~),'-
GREAT FRAUDS POSSIBLE.
United States District Judge James H.
Beatty of Idaho, sitting in the United
States Circuit Court, handed down an
opinion yesterday granting the prayer of
the complainants in the suit of Roland
R: Conklin and others against the United
States Shipbuilding Company for the ap
pointment of James Smith Jr. of New
Jersey as receiver for the Union Iron
Works in this city.
In passing upon the allegations of fraud
made in the complaint the court says:
It is further charged that in May. 1903, in
furtherance of their designs to wreck defend
ant and transfer its property to themselves,
these parties entered into a plan of reorganiza
tion of detendant. This is too lengthy and In
tricate for statement here, nor iÂ» its consid
eration essential. As a suggestion of tha
truth of complainants' charges of fraud atten
tion may be called to a provision in the "reor
ganization plan" that, "t^ assure continuity in
the management of the new corporation. â¢ â¢ â¢
a votine trust of the entire capital, stock or
the hew corporation will be created, to be ia
force for. a period of seven years, . The voting
trustees are to be five in number. The reor
ganization committee have selected as the ini
tial voting trustees Messrs. Charles M. Schwab,
George R. Sheldon,. Max Pani, Charles W.
Wetmore, James H. Reed of Pittsburg." Com
plainants say that two of these are Schwab's
attorneys. Certainly such a plan would not
only '"assure continuity in the management,"
but in view of the further insidious, provision
thai "any. vacancy thereafter occurring, caused
by the death or resignation of any voting
truBtee, shall be fl'.led by the appointment In
writing of a majority of the remaining voting
trustees?," It is evident that absolute control
for seven, years would, be assured to Schwab
and his associates, which would be ample time,
through the aid of some other shrewdly devised
provisions of this "reorganization plan," for
them to take to themselves both the perma
nent control and the title of all of defendant's
property, which it is alleged Is the end in
view. , .

INGS FOR THE WEEK, AND
TWO FAVORITES.
The Central Theater scored a hit last
night with its special Grand Army week
attraction, "Cumberland, '61," a thrilling
military play based ; on incidents of the
Civil War. The house was crowded and
in the audience many gray haired, blue
coated veterans were in , evidence. The
play is patriotic and the plot replete with
dramatic power, while . _ the climaxes
arouse the audience to enthusiasm. The
scenery of "Cumberland, '61" is pictu
resque, giving views .of West Point on
the Hudson and of the grand and rugged
mountains of old Kentucky. The orches
tral music too, is a feature, . all the
American natrlotic airs and the battle
marches of North and. South being ren

Chairs had to be provided for the over

many had to be turned away. The doublo
bill, "Quo Vass Iss" and "The Big Little
Princess," continues a potent attraction
and the funmakers, Kolb, Dill, Bernard,
Blake and Hermsen, are, if anything, fun
nier than ever, especially In "The Big
Little Princess." Bernard as the school
mistress is inimitable and his song, "Mrs.
Plnchln's Boarding School." had to be re
peated several times. Miss Maude Amber

greatest interest by the players in tho
tournament, and the general consensus of
opinion was that he did not exert himself
to play. He played a graceful game, using
several strokes and placing marvelously
well. His cross court strokes and back
hand Btrokes were especially fine. He
seemed to have little trouble in passing
Hill at the net and returned almost every

Miss Alice Wander's Mrs. Dudgeon was

was charmingly simple and natural as

rightly keyed, but not enough of it. He
has not the superb manner, the "grand
air" with which one credits this exiled
Chesterfield, but he still delivers the Bur
goyne witticisms with right proper point
and flavor.
"In Harvard" is by all odds the best
burlesque production that has been pro
duced at the Grand Opera-house, and thit
is saying a great 'deal. The finale of the
second act, "College Days," is a revela
tion both in color and motion and the cos
tumes are handsome in the extreme. Â¦ In
fact the piece abounds in beautiful effects
and lavish scenic environment. Cfieridah
Simpson's piano specialty, in which she
imitates a music box and an autoharp,
is clevely executed and her singing seems
to improve with a second hearing. Ray
mond and Caverly have some amusing
parodies and both comedians work hard
to insure the success of the play, which
began its second week last night. Budd
Ross and Anna Wilks have a pleasing
song and dance specialty entitled "The
Red Carnation," and Harold Crane makes
a hit with his coster songs. Loutee Moore
is seen and heard to advantage In "Rain
bows Follow After Rain." in which she
is assisted by the entire chorus of pretty
girls. Julie Cotte and Winifred Gordon
give effective aid in the song "The
Troubles of the Reuben and the Maid."
Grand Opera-House.
Miller has the part of the "devil's dis
ciple," Dick Dudgeon, and Shaw's hero.
His conception has fully the gay noncha
lance of the character, its skin deep cyn
icism, its infrequent tenderness. A little,
perhaps, Mr. Miller fails In conveying the
bigness of the fellow's personality, a lit
tle, perhaps, on the visionary and idealis
tic Bide of the character. Shaw has not
given him the chance as the part Sydney
Carton gave him, too, but one still feels
that there are outlines a little fuller than
the actor has filled, colors a' little richer
than, he has painted. But 'tis a great
part, finely played, and Mr. Miller's ad
mirers must by no means miss him in it.
As Judith, the minister's wife, who falls
from sudden hate into love for the village
scapegrace, Miss Anglin has a highly con
genial part Rather cruelly ; Shaw has
painted the lady, with her tiny ideals, her
worship of distinction, her various con
ventionalities and appalling lack of hu
mor, but MIsb Anglin wins a large suc
cess in the part. The Puritan gowns are
most particularly becoming, by. the way. K
Mr. Morton Selten's General Burgoyne
is not wholly convincing. It is a portrait
in little of that fastidious aristocrat,
ear of the public on a cart
irr. Hyde Park, to the blaring of brass
bands, and this not at all as a reluctant
eacriflce of privacy to political necessity,
but because, like all dramatists and
mimes of genuine vocation, I am a nat
ural-born mountebank." So Shaw, in his
illuminative preface to the "Three Plays
for Puritans." of which the first, "The
Devil's Disciple," was presented by Henry
Miller, Margaret Anglin and their com
pany .last night at the Columbia Theater.
For in spite of all temptations to be
long to other nations, we have again
among us those eminently welcome play
ers. How welcome, last night's reception
simply proved over again. These two have
a unique niche in the local play-goer's
heart. They are peculiarly our own, and
we love 'em for it, faults and all. Tho
winsome Anglin first found herself
famous here, and 'twill be a far day when
Miller is forgotten In San Francisco. One
felt It right friendly, but only true, when
Miller said his and Miss Angln's "how
dye-dos," for him to say that last night
was a home-coming for them, and that
the good-bye to be said in five weeks
would be inconspicuously cheerful. But
the house, filled to its last seat and more,
Btopped Mr. Shaw's "brass band" for sev
eral measures when Miss Anglin came
in, grace itself In her Puritan browns.
The appearance of Henry Miller was the
signal for another intermezzo, . and ' the
audience did its best to compel a curtain
speech at the time Shaw closes his first
act. It was a welcome to be proud of,
un-Columbian quite In Its frank noise,
and the actors surely enjoyed it. At
least I saw Miss Anglin's pretty mouth
puckered for a "good" cry over it!
Subtract the personal popularity of the
chief players and one still finds in "The
Devil's Disciple" a play shrewdly inter
esting, of a ripe piquancy and rare flavor.
The "brass band" is over It all, but how
well it is handled! One minds not at ail
any more than In an Oscar Wilde play â
that the characters are simply the mouth
pieces of the author, that the Presbyterian
minister preaches "The Quintessence of
Ibsenism"; that General Burgoyne voices
âin the Shaw manner, wholly deliciousâ
the witty Irishman's opinion of British
stupidity; that* Dick Dudgeon's gospel is
Shaw's creed. The whole thing is posed,
but -how excellently posed! The char
acters are blocked in with a frank the
atricallsm that Is productive of nothing
but joy, and one takes in even trie time
worn dispatch at the foot of the scaffold
with a lovely and wholesome acceptance.
Mechanically the play Is superbly built
and it eucceeds in leaving, In Its own
peculiar fashion, just the Impression Shaw
desired to convey. Puritanism has never
been more slyly and daringly pilloried,
nor the colonial war more acutely rid
iculed. The audience was delightfully re
sponsive. Mrs. Dudgeon's vicious puri
tanlsm, as she attacks the poor Illegiti
mate left in her keeping, immediately
struck the audience on its humorous spot,
and from there until the end of the play
there was a continuous gurgle. The dia
logue, being Shaw's, could not do other
than scintillate. That is where it so
heavily loseB In realism and one so heav
*ily gains in enjoyment.

There was great curiosity to see the ex
preacher, Edwartis Davis, who"* ap
peared for the first time in this city be
fore a goodly number of people who had
heard him in the pulpit. He was the
ostensible hero of the play, lover, abo
lition orator, husband of the heroine,
rescuer of the squire, who, according to
a stage idea as old as the history of the
drama itself, is about to be sold out on
foreclosure of mortgage. The truth is
that Davis made , a dignified figure for
the most part. There were some manner-
Isms that, were reminiscent of pulpit ora
tory, but the general effect of his work
was good. He was successful beyond or
dinary expectation- and never awkward.'
He evidently has. enough dramatic ability
to make a very much stronger showing
with greater experience. Hardly too
much can be said in favor of HÂ«nry D.
Byers as Squire Hurley. The same praise
may be given to Tony West as Joel Whit
beck, the Yankee peddler, whose clever
ness had a tang to it. Excellently well

tucky belle whose love of a Union hero
overcomes her: sentiment for the South
looked and acted the part charmingly.
Miss Lawton is one of the clever and
beautiful daughters of the Blue Grass
State. Henry Shumer had the thankless
role of a conscienceless Southern colonel,
an officer who lacked the chivalry pro
verbial of the South, and George P.
Webster gave an effective Dick j Kansett,
a cadet with a hjstory ; and an oath of
vengeance. - George Nlcholls played well
the. part of the sturdy mountaineer who
harbors' a vendetta aealnst the family
of the hero. - : He Is the father of the
heroine and he strikes, at the Union hero's
life in the most startling ecene of the
drama, on a bridge which has been set
afire to prevent the " biuecoat's escape.
The staging was all that the manage
ment advertised. There were live fowls,
a live horse, a very fair stage snowstorm,
Jingling bells to indicate the arrival of
sleighs for the "squire's" merry-making
on Christmas eve, at least two score of
people on the stage at once, moonlight
enough to seem real in a courtship scene
and to send romantic thrills through the
callow minded, a village street so ar
ranged that the peddler's cart is driven
realistically through it. and other details
were provided to give excellent semblance
of reality. It was worth all theNmoney
expended on lta production and all the
money an audience,' that crowded the
house paid to see It.
It Is sweet and pure and filled with
laughter, the laughter being due about
equally to the skill of the playwright
and of the very clever work that marked
its production at the Alcazar.
No one will accuse the play writer of
not furnishing enough material, for the
play was not done until hard upon mid
night. This was due to long waits be
tween scenes, Incidental to the first pro
duction, but had the waits been shorter
the play would have filled up three hours
or more. Â«
"The Dairy Farm," the , play in
which Edwards Davl3- V made his initial
bow to the public as a professional
thespian, "is pure, sweet and whole
some." It is more than that, for it Is
also interesting. Strongly it t reminds one
of "Hazel Kirke," famous Â¦ on the stage
for phenomenally long -runs of continu
ous favor, especially in the character of
Squire Hurley, the man of "Iron will."
It outdoes "Uncle Tom's Cabin" in the
outrages that It depicts as having been
perpetrated on one particular black man
who is a refugee slave, and is betrayed
to his former servitude when in the hands
of a supposed friend who is to conduct
him to Canada. This the black man fin
ally revenges by a murder.
No one will say that "The Dairy Farm"
is original in any particular, but it was
cleverly compiled from a great amount
of available material of proved value in
affecting the risibilities and command
ing the tears of audiences, and the result
Is that it stands forth with prom
ise of. being a strong and continued suc
cess.

week drew as large a house as the first,

of the electric lights and the old soldiers
on the streets. Miss d'Arville was in good
voice last night and sang with a spirit

of the opera, was in his best vein and
kept the audience convulsed with merri

the "Pacific Mail opposition' has compelled them

before sunrise Captain Houdlette had
dropped his anchor In the quarantine
grounds where the Federal health regu
lations required the liner to remain until
the government doctors had made an In
spection of passengers, crew and cargo
and granted free pratique. The Sierra
picked up her pilot late on Sunday night.
Fine weather was encountered through
out the voyage. The liner's actual steam
ing timfe from Sydney to San Francisco
was 20 days and 52 minutes. She made
better time from Honolulu than the
America Maru by 13 hours.
From Sydney she brought ICO boxes of
English sovereigns valued at $2,500,000.
She brought more than 250 passengers.
A large number of Japanese came on the
liner from Honolulu.

Judge Rcsers held that the Western
Union Company had the absolute right to
discharge employes not under contract
relations with the company for any cause
or without cause; that a like right exists
on the part of the employe' to sever his
relations with the company for any cause
or without cause; that if a contract of
employment is violated the recourse of
the employe is at law and not by a bill
in equity, such as was brought in' this
case; that there could be no conspiracy
to commit a lawful act. such as he held
to be the discharge of the company's em
ployes because cf being members cf a
union; that the company haJ the right to
maintain a list or. which might be placed
the name of a discharged "employe and
th? cause of discharge and this list might
be jjiven other?, provided Us contents
were truthful and its circulation honest;
that as the bill alleged the union was
formed for moral and proper purposes,
there should exist no objection upon tile
part cf an employe to have his discharge
laseu upon the mere fact that he was a
member of such an order. This decision
is regarded as conclusively settling the
law in the Western Union Company's
favor.
The plaintiffs took fifteen days to
amend the bill.
The case arose from the fact that a certain
number of operators were relitfved on account
t:on and for other causes. They contended it
was on account of belonging to the union and
they were therefore deprived of a livelihood.
Jt was conclusively thown that all operators
eo relieved were employed either by brokfrj
or railroads with the exception of one, who
cculd not be located. 1 do not care to say
anything further. *
The bill sought to prevent the Western
Union Company from discharging any
employe because of his being a member of
the union and the St. Louis officers of the
Western Union from conspiring to that
end and to prevent interference of any
kind with the union, and io prevent the
Western Union from maintaining a black
list and placing thereon the names of
those who might be discharged because
<;f being members of che union. The
Western Union Company demurred to the
bill and this demurrer sustained by
Judge Rogers of Arkansas, sitting in the
I.'nited States Circuit Court.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Aug. 17.â Judge Rog
ers in the United States Circuit Court to
day handed down an opinion sustaining
the demurrer of .the Western Union Tele
graph Company in the labor injunction
case of Beyer et al. against that company.
In the written opinion JuOge Rogers sus
tains every point urge-1 by Attorney
Smith, representing the defendant com
pany, holding that the company has the
absolute right to dismiss employes be
cause they belong jo the union, or for any
other reason; that there can be no con
spiracy to do a lawful act; that the so
called blacklist may be maintained and

not Informed that Russia had consented
to the opening. Finally he refused on the
ground that China was unable, to open

Hostetter's Stomach Bitters is ,
without an equal. It will not j
gripe nor shock the system, and
make you feel sick all over like
most cathartics do, but has a firm
and gentle effect on the consti- i
pated bowels, stimulating and as- j
sisting them in the prqper per- i
formance of their functions. Then !
an occasional dose is all that is:
needed to keep the bowels regular j
and the stomach strong. A trial
will convince you of its value.

GRIDLEY. Aup. 17.-E. A. Boyles of
this place went to the mountains cf Plu
mas County on a hunting trip last week
and In a letter received to-day tells of
his strange experience in the wild coun
try. Returning from a day's trip, he
stepped into an old mine tunnel, and be
ing attracted by the character of the
rock of the walls of the tunnel he struck
a match and walked some distance into
the incline. As he turned to go back to
the mouth of the opening he saw a deer
standing in a patch of light at the en
trance to the tunnel. He raised his rlflo
and fired and immediately.a mass of rock
fell in front of him and partly covered
him. He was not seriously Injured, but
was horrified to find that his exit had
been cut off by a cave which had doubt
less been started by the shock following
the discharge of the rifle.
Boyles then followed. the tunnel back
ward, relieving the darkness by striking
matches, and found that it led to a shaft.
The timbers of the shaft were rotten and
there w^s no ladder, but there was a
chance to climb downward. He let him
self down the old shaft and finding an
other tunnel at the lower level wandered
along its length and after squeezing
through over parts of the roof that had
caved in he reached the outer air near
the bed of a creek. The tunnel through
which he escaped was an old drainaga
way and still carried off the water of
the mine, making pools, through which
he had to wade up to his waist. "When
he ent out it was dark, and being con
fused by his experience he lost his way
and did not reach camp until the fol
lowing morning.

sold oft sharply. Everything was against the

i aided to the depression, and before the selling

only other transactions were in Mutual Elec
tric at $13Â® 13 50 and in Gas and Electrio at

stocks being dull and not materially changed.
In the afternoon Alaska Packers continued
to improve, selling up to $145, with more buy
ers ' than sellers. The lmnrovement tn this

tion of the market situation as far as this

down to $63. Home OH continued to decline,
selling at $1 15.

Trade in the fruit market was unusually
brisk for Monday. duÂ» chiefly to the extra re
quirements of hotels and restaurants during
the G. A. R. Encampment. Nearly all descrip

were well maintained, with occasional lots of
desirable stock selling at a small premium over
the quoted rates. Receipts of Berries werj
light and Strawberries and Raspberries cleaned
up quickly at higher rates, while Blaakberries
were easier, owing to the poor quality of the
offerings. Apple?, Pears, Plums and Peaches
of good quality were steady and unchanged,
but common end Inferior offerings dragged at
easy* rates. Grapes arrived freely and fancy
offerings were in fair request, but the general
run of supplies were poor and small and
moved slowly in consequence. Watermelons
were active, owing to the warm, sunn? weath
er, and fine large Melons sold in a small way
up to $20 per hundred. Cantaloupes and Nut

SAN JOSE. Aug. 17.â Cornelius McCar
thy, gardener at St. James Park, was
found dead near the Fourth-street depot
this morning with his skull fractuned and
one foot crushed. He had evidently fallen
off the nlÂ£ht train from Los Angeles. He
went to Santa Cruz with his family yes
terday, but was not seen after the train
left Watsonville. It is supposed that he
stepped off at Watsonville. that the train
left him and that he afterward took the
Los Aneeles train at Pajaro, which sr
rived in San Jose at 12:30 last ni*nt. s

REAL ESTATE TBANSACTIONS.
A strenuous fight is being made against
allowing the- notorious place to open
again, and every means is being taken to
block the passage of vne resolution.
The question of whether a woman could
be considered a legal signer was referred
to the District Attorney, while a survey
has to be made to settle which are the
nearest ten residents. In, order that this
may be done, the question went over for
another week. 'Yi-,'v
.When the matter was brought up before
the board thia morning it was asserted
that among the signers was a woman and
that Schnarr did not have the necessary
six out of the nearest ten residents.

CHIHUAHUA. Mexico. Aug. 17.'â A sen
sational duel was fought here yesterday.
Joseph Searcy, an American traveling
man for Ketelsen & Degetau, killed Lieu
tenant Chalos J. Estrada, aid to General
Bravo of the Mexican army.
Estrada found Searcy at a bull fight and
invited him to fight a duel. They hired
a coach together, and, without seconds,
drove to the vacant country, where they
fought with pistols. Three shots were ex
changed. Estrada was shot through the
head. Searcy gave himself up. 4 ''.-',, I
There, are conflicting stories of the causa
of the tragedy, but the most common ver
sion is that it was about a Mexican bella
to whom both had been paying marked
attention. - - Â¦

practice made by . amateurs and j profes
sionals. Hunter won his match- handily
by 4 up, going out in 33 and. coming home
in 36: but Egan was not disgraced, for
he totaled 76, which is one better than
his- former record and only one .stroke
worse than the record of 75 made yes
terday by.C. H. G. Ellis of Oxford, and
equaled early to-day by,H. W. Lautheart
of Cambridge. Not even British Cham
pion Harry. Vardon, who made the Chi

who was followed by the largest group
of professionals from hi.s native land that

the men under his employ. AH of the
men discharged by him Saturday, with
the exception of John Reily, who Is sick
in bed, and Thomas Quinn, who does not
seem to care, reported for work yester
day. Even John McKenas, whose broth

notwithstanding that his chief had brand

his duty. 'William Kennedy and James

Owing to a scarcity of jwater In the
wells of the Vlsltacion "Water Company,
the residents of Butchertown have had
cause for complaint for the past three
days. On Saturday the supply was shut
off and yesterday morning only the cus
tomers on the lower ground were sup
plied. ' The company says that the force
is not sufficient at present to raise the
water to the residents on the side of the
hill, but expects to be able to remedy
the difficulty within a few days.'
Water Is Scarce.
The order was obeyed and one of the
victims fell dead A The man who did the
shooting escaped, but Quong must pay
the penalty for the deed.
After a trial lasting nearly a month, a
Jury In Judge Lawlor's department of
the Superior Court returned a verdict of
guilty of murder \ in the first degree
against Quong Quock Wall, one of the
presidents of the See Yup Society, who
was indicted by the last Grand Jury.
"After strong arguments on the part of
the attorneys for the prosecution and de
fense, the case went to the Jury, which,
after deliberating more than two hours,
returned a verdict of guilty. The crime
for which Quong Quock "Wah was tried
and convicted occurred on May 7 of this
year, about 11 p. m., in Ross alley. The
murder was the result of a feud that had
been raging between the See Yups and
the Educational Society.
The testimony adduced at the trial
showed that on the night in question two
Educational Society men were, walking
along Ross alley and when near the cigar
store conducted by the defendant' some
one gave notice of their coming. Quong,
seizing a revolver, handed the weapon to
one of his countrymen, supposed to be
Nick Yung, with instructions to shoot.

BIG CORPORATIONS SEEK
SEDUCTION OF ASSESSMENTS
The syndicate feels that by combining
the laundries a great deal of money will
be saved. The laundry wagon routes will
be divided up into about 100 districts and
in this way the number of wagons can
be materially decreased.. The new com
pany will also establish more agencies at
Important points in the city and the
present arrangement of allowing owners
of barber shops and bootblack stands a
commission will be done away with as
much as possible.
The new laundry syndicate promises not
to increase the present laundry rates. In
fact, the etockholders are of the opinion
that with the decrease in the present op
erative expenses they will be able to ma
terially lower the present rates. This last
statement is encouraging. Judging from
the fact that the steam laundries of the
city have been gradually increasing their
rates during the last two years.
An official of the new syndicate said
yesterday that the laundries of this city
at the present time do $200,000 worth of
business a month. He refused to state
what the capitalization of the new com
pany will be.
One of the stockholders in the syndi
cate said that the prices asked by the
different laundries for their plants and
good will were 4n all cases most reason
able. The owners of the laundries will
receive in each case a portion of the pur
chase price in cash and the balance in
stock of the new corporation.
? The new syndicate, when It takes con
trol, will close down one or two smaller
laundries in remote districts in this city.
but the big laundries, such as the San
Francisco and United States, will ren.ain
undisturbed.
The steam laundries that have fixed a
pr!cÂ« for their plants are the San Fran
cisco, United States, the Grand. Contra
Costa, St. Nicholas, Cascade, Electric,
White Star, Troy. Empire, Eureka, Yo
semite and Shasta.
The attorneys for the syndicate are
.Thomas Â£z Gerstle of 222 Sansome street,
end they are busy drawing up the neces
sary papers to put the deal through.
The latest syndicate in town is the
"Laundry Trust" and within a few weeks
all the steam laundries of this city will
be merged into one big company. The
company has unlimited capital back of it
and the stockholders promise various im
provements.
NEW YORK, Aug. 17.â A Herald special
from Topeka, Kans., says Clarence ~E.
Sharon, who will be brought back here
from San Francisco to answer to a charge
of embezzlement, formerly was a non
commissioned officer in the Twentieth
Kansas Volunteers. A year ago he waa
elected captain of the Topeka company
of the Kansas National Guard. He had
charge of a great deal of property belong
ing to the State and was supplied with
money to pay the expenses of the com
pany. It is charged that 'tie took some
of the State's property and $350 in fund*.
His wife and children are with him.
Clarence E. Sharon was arrested on
Sunday night by Detectives Ed. Gibson
and Coleman on a circular from Sheriff
H. E. Lucas of Topeka, Kans., that he
was wanted there for felony embezzle
ment. The detectives found him at a
lodging-house on Polk .street, near Mc-
Allister. He was locked up In the
tanks and the Sheriff was notified of his
arrest. A" reply was received yesterday
that an officer would be sent at once with
the papers, for his extradition.
â¢ Sharon was a member of the Twentieth
Kansas regiment that went to Manila
and on his return to Topeka was made
a captain of the Kansas National Guard.
He disappeared from Topeka last Sep
tember and an investigation showed that
$300 and much of the stores of the guards
which were under his supervision were
missing.
Sheriff Lucas sent circulars all over
the country that Sharon was wanted for
felony embezzlement and giving an ac
curate description of him. Captain Mar
tin learned on Sunday that a" man an
swering Sharon's description was living
on Polk street, near McAllister, and he
detailed Gibson and Coleman on the case.
They had to wait patiently for several
hours till Sharon made his appearance.
He did not deny his Identity and willing
ly accompanied them to the City Prison.
Sharon said that he could not under
stand why he should be arrested, as his
accounts were all right. There was a dis
pute between some of the other officers
and himself about $200, but he thought
the matter had been satisfactorily ad
justed. He attributed the charge against
him to his enemies and believed that he
would soon fix up everything satisfac
torily.
The body of an unknown man was found
to-day on the shore of Contra Costa
County, near Point Isabel, by Thomas
Burns, who was out on the marsh picking
up wood. It is that of a man about 40
years of age, 5 feet 9 inches in 'height and
weighing about 160 pounds.
The body was dressed in a black coat
and vest, light pants, white shirt, cellu
loid collar, black bow tie and lace shoes.
On tho vest was a green button, on which
could be deciphered the letters ."R. H."
in a monogram. This is the style of but
ton worn by members of the Cooks' and
"Walters' Union, and it is thought the
man may have been a waiter. It is
thought by some that the body mayfte
that of Charles Shores, the absconding
treasurer of the Cooks" and Walters'
Union of this city. The body was removed
to the Contra Costa County Morgue at
Martinez.
The Identification was complete, both
from the clothing and from a watch con
taining the pictures of Mrs. Cheline and
her child.
Emile Cheline was well known In Val
lejo, where he had lived for some time,
lie left a widow In that city and several
brothers, who are engaged in the commis
sion business in San Francisco. The
father of deceased is a retired capitalist,
residing in San Jose. The Coroner of
Contra Costa County will ship the body
to Vallejo for burial.
OAKLAND. Augr. 17.â The body of
Emile Cheline, who was drowned Sunday,
August 9, by the capsizing of the yacht
Heinle in Carqulnez Straits, was found
to-day near the Selby Smelting Works by
an employe of the smelter.
It was removed to the Morgue at Mar
tinez, where it was positively Identified as
the body of Cheline by Officer E. A. Wil

HEAD SOLID SORE
Awful Suffering of Baby and
Sleepless Nights of
Mother.
Another Wonderful Cure
by Cutlcura.
" I herewith write oat in fall the be-
ginning and end of that terrible disease
Eczema, which caused xny babe untold
suffering and myself many sleepless
sights.
44 My baby was born seemingly a fair,
fctalthy child, bat when she was thret
weeks old a swelling appeared on the
back of her head, and in coarse of time
broke. It did not heal bat grew worse,
and the core spread from the size of
a dime to that of a dollar. I used all
kinds of remedies that I conld think of,
but nothing seemed to help ; in fact, it
grew worse. Her hair fell oat where
the sore was, and I fe&red it would
sever grow again. It continued until
my aged father came on a visit, and
when he saw the baby he told me ' to
get Caticara Soap and Caticara Oint-
. ment right away.'
*' To please him I did so, and to my
surprise by their use the sore began to
heal over, the hair grew over it, and
' to-day she has a nice head of hair, her
skin Is as fair as a lily, and she has no
scar left to recall that awful sore, and
1 it is over eight months and no sign of
. It retaining."
Mrs. Wm. Rter, Elk Elver, Minn.
CURE PERMANENT
Mrs. Ryer writes Feb. 25, 1903, Six
Years' Later, That Cure is
Permanent.
" Tonr letter of the 19th lnst. received
asking in regard to the core of my baby
' come six years ago. Well, the disease
has never returned to her hesd which st
' that time was a solid sore* on top and
â¢ down the back. Once or twice since
then a patch has come on her hand near
â¢ the wrist but it finally disappeared
after proper treatment with Cotlcara."
