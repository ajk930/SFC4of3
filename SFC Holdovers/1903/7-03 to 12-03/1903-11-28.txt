WASHINGTON. Nov. 27.â The State
Department has received advices from
Minister Beaupre at Bogota, dated No
vember 25, In which he states -that con
siderable excitement prevails at the Co
lombian capital; that there is much
talk of raising an army, but no troops
have yet been enlisted, and there are
rumors in the city of a revolution in
the State of Cauca, directed against
the Marroquin government. Rumors
have reached the State Department
from another source that General

Th'ere also is talk of the ; forma

United States. Respecting the coming
of General Reyes to Washington, it is
said at the - State Department that
much depends .upon ' ; the nature of his

given. It ; seems probable that if he is

bullets at 7 o'cloci to-night startled
the aristocratic Lakeside district, and
when the battle in the dark was over
Policeman J. H. Smith lay dying on
the steps of a nearby house, one burg

the efcootlng occurred, and the second
burglar had escaped.
Two hours later Policeman Smith
died from his wounds and to-night the
entire police force of Oakland is out
searching for the man who got away.
Such was the record of one night's
bloody work in the effort to capture
the burglar* that had been working
Oakland successfully for thirty days.
Ever eince the robbery of the Crel

â¢which resulted in the^theft of $6003

duty that Policeman Smith came to his
death.
It remained for two lads in the neigh

burglar. . Fred and Charles Kutz, at
tracted by the shooting and the excite
ment, mixed with the crowd and they
found the body* of the dead man on the
lawn beside the residence of H. J.
Knowies, corner of Fourteenth and Oak
streets, two blocks from where the
Ehootlng - occurred.
The man had run two block's and then
dropped beside the Kno wles residence,
but. his partner had continued on his
way and made his escape. When found,
the body lay partly on one side. When
Captain Petersen was notified a hurried
search of - the < pockets revealed many

It required but a moment for the

with the patrol wagon and two aids.
He found Policeman Smith partly con

tion and taken to the Receiving Hospi
tal, from which place the captain or
dered every available man In the de
partment out in citizens' clothes to pa
trol the district in which the shooting
occurred in the hopes of capturing the
men. As soon as the wounded man had
been cared for Captain Petersen joined
Chief .of Police Hodgkins and the two
took charge of the' squad that was
searching the district for the escapes.
The entire neighborhood was aroused
by the shots, and people began running
from all directions, but instead of try
ing to stop those running away from
the scene, efforts were directed toward
finding: out what had occurred. Mem

No sooner were the words out of his

Smith, though he must have been hit
early in the firing, drew his revolver
and fired back. '
There was no hesitation about the
movements of the young policeman. He
saw several suspicious circumstances,
and with the courage that had marked
his career in the department he deter
mined to satisfy those suspicions or

two men and that he was alone did not
deter him. and he dashed down Four

at the corner of Jackson as they had
doubled back upon their trail.
Without a moment's hesitation Smith
stopped the men and began to question
them as to who they were and where
they came from. Their answers were
vague and unsatisfactory, and when
they did not explain to his satisfaction
Smith said:

VIENNA. Nov. 27.â The Wiener A1I
gemeine Zeitung prints the following
dispatch from Berlin ia reference to
Emperor William, which attracts gen
eral attention, especially as the Zeitung
often receives semi-official information:
"Though there can be no doubt that
the- operation recently undergone by
the Emperor concerned a benignant
formation, it must be recognized that
the process of healing has not taken tha
favorable course originally hoped for.
It Is by no means certain that in the
near future the Emperor will under
take a Journey south, since it is doubt
ful whether hfs physicians will assume
the responsibility of exposing the mon
arch in his present condition to the fa
tigue of a long journey.
."In the whole course of the process
of healing hitherto it seems as though
there had arisen unexpected complica
tions which .very rarely follow the sim
ple operation for singers' polypus. In
court, circles there is a certain uneasi
ness, which, during the last few days,
has found expression in talk of the pos
sibility and" even the probability of a
new operation.
â¢It is impossible to verify the latter
rumor. -The Emperor, whose mood re
mains good, has been ordered by his
physicians to take the maximum cf
rest, and to spare his vocal organs as
much as possible."

Roeski ran for the brush, but Van

around him was filled with bullets and
the snow at his feet was kicked up by
them. Catching Bight of Detective

fired. ZImmer went down with a bul

The love Mr. Rainey had always
shown for his home was feelingly re
ferred to and the Rev. Mr. Reed said
that those present spoke one language
â that of sympathy. Life, he said, was
but a pilgrimage . wherein men have
their meetings and their farewells. Did
they but know death he believed they
would love it. j It was but the falling
tor sleep and the crossing of the foun
tain of life to another land even more
beautiful than this.
The Rev. Mr. Reed's prayer and eu
logy were impressive. The reverend
gentleman thanked the Father for life,
for joys and life's happiness, for bright
days and for the home and its tender
memories and friendship, for hope, am
bition and ideals. He thanked the
Father also for the sad days of life,

Arosemena.one of the delegates from
the republic of Panama, when asked to
night about a report that the Depart
ment of Cauca had made application
fur admission to the ncv republic, said:
"I do' not think it possible that any
such overture has been made by the
Government of the department. Just
before I left Panama I talked with one
of. the prominent men of Cauca, who
was himself an advocate of union with
Panama, and who told me. that* there
was. a considerable party in the depart
ment fvorable tc- such a union. That
party is, however, greatly in the minor
ity and beyond doubt Cauca's attitude
leans strongly toward Colombia. Even
assuming that a proposition for union
should come officially from the authori
ties "of Cauca there, is no manner of
doubt that it would receive no consid
eration at the hands of the republic of
Panama. Panama is quite satisfied
.with her- position as it stands."

PANAMA, Nov. 28.â The slight oppo
sition to the ratification of the canal
treaty between the republic of Panama
and the United States which prevailed
on the isthmus a day or two ago ap
pears to have been overcome, if not
altogether dissipated. > This opposition
existed among a few Government of
ficials, who how have been wtfVovei*
and thoroughly convinced by the rea
sonable arguments of their confreres.
The plan outlined in these dispatches
yesterday by which the treaty was to
be signed and dispatched to Washing
ton on the day of its' arrival here has
been abandoned because it Is feared
such rapidity of action mlghf give the
impression that the treaty had been
hasty and Inadequately considered and
thus lay the members of the Junta open
to criticism. It is absolutely (Ortafn,
however, that 'the treaty will be ratified
without the slightest opposition.
In Government circles here it is now
said that the junta, as soon as tht*
treaty has been ratified, will address a
note to Secretary Hay^ asking that
$2,000,000 be paid in cash to*the Panama
Government and. that $3,000,000 shall be
transferred ; in such a manner that it
can be invested, the interest being pay
able to the Government. It can be said
authoritatively that the junta is still
firmly' opposed to undertaking tr.e re
sponsibility for any portion 6i-. Colom

Respecting the statements attriouted
to the general in a New' Orleans inter
view that Colombia ,., would send 100!
000 men into Panama pVerland, the fact
is recalled that the instructions to the
United States naval officers on the
isthmus were such that they would not
admit to the. neighborhood of the isth

derstood by the officers In question that^
hostile Colombian troops would not be

point either by water or by land, and

COLOMBIA'S AGENT SEEKS PEACE.
About 7 o'clock James Herd, a* local
expressman, telephoned to the police
station that Mrs. Downey was at his
house.-where she had called to see Miss
Cunningham, a lodger. Ross and a
couple of officers hurried to the house
and found "Mrs. Downey., She ex
pressed great surprise when arrested^
saying: "I love "Charles Wilson, and If
I had shot him I Would have turned the
gun oh myself. I haven't been near the
stable to-dayand have not seen him."
She submitted quietly to a thorough
search by the police, which failed to re
veal any weapon. 5k-
Mrs. Downey continued to deny all
knowledge of the affair and stood the
most rigid cross-questioning without
flinching. She was told by the officers
that Wilson was dead in the hope of
eliciting a confession, and although
much moved, she refused to make any
admission.
SANTA BARBARA, Nov. 27.â A sen
sational shooting affray took place here
late this afternoon, the victim being
Charles A. Wilson, a prominent livery
man of this city. The affair is sur
rounded with mystery, but suspicion
points to Mrs. Jennie Downey as the
pistol wielder. Wilson has had trouble
with the woman and it Is said she
threatened him several times. -
Wilson ascended to the loft of the
Olympic stable shortly after 5 o'clock
to feed his stock and a minute or so
later one of the stablemen heard four
shots coming from the upper pfert of
the building. Immediately afterward
Wilson, appeared at one of the ground
floor windows calling for help. He said
that he had been shot by Mrs. Downey
and had made his escape from the loft
by sliding down a rope from one of the
upper windows/
The wounded man was assisted into
the stable and made as comfortable as
possible, while medical aid and the po
lice were summoned. He was moved
subsequently *tb the Cottage Hospital
and at a late hour to-night was re
ported doing well. The bullet struck
him in the back and glanced around on
a rib under the heart and came out
above the abdomen: â¢
A few minutes after the shooting
Chief of Police Ross arrived at the sta
ble" and instituted a thorough search
throughout the large loft for Mrs.
Downey, who had not been seen to
leave the premises. He was unsuccess
ful" in his quest and proceeded to the
railroad station to prevent any escape
on the northbound train due about that
time. Â¦

At half past 8 o'clock the family was
told to take final farewell. They went
in one at a time, and by the time the
last one had taken his adieu the dying
man had breathed his last. His lids
were closed by the attending physi-
Twice the dying man asked for 1iis

a wooed time by Dr. H. B. Mehrmann.
Tears were streaming- down her cheeks
as she kissed her son for the last time
and she heard him tell her not. to get
excited and to look out for his sister
Ida.
The wounded man lived for about
two hours after receiving the fatal
shots. Drs. O. D. Hamlin. R. T. Strat
ton and Lewis M. Emerson did all they
could to make the last moments of his
life as painless as possible. One bullet
entered his right side Just, belbw the
nipple and lodged in the chest cavity.
The second took effect in the back be
neath the left shoulder blade and
ranged downward. Copious internal
hemorrhage resulted from both wounds
and death was only a question of a
very short time. It was teen imme
diately that there was no hope, and the
family was notified to prepare for the
worst. â¢' ' J.
DIES OF HE1I0BBHAGES.
At the hospital it was evident that
Smith was fatally injured. His broth
er. Police Judge Mortimer Smith, was
notified, and his two brothers, a sister
and bis mother were soon at his side
In the operatir.B-room. Thoy were al
lowed to see him only for a short
time. A room was given over to their
disposal across a passageway, and at
intervals the different members of the
family went from the room to the op
erating chamber. It was a painful
5<cen(? for those who witnessed the af
fliction of the family. It was . only a
short time ago .the father died.
"As soon as I reached the hospital
I notified Chief Hodgkins and the dis
trict was thoroughly patrolled."
"Smith was conscious and very brave.
Ke seemed to know that he was seri
ously injured, and he was divided be
tween an effort to tell me all that he
knew and his worry over what his
mother would think. In spite of his
pain, which was evidently great, he
racked his brain in an effort to give me
every detail that might bÂ£ of use in
tracing the men, and then he would
suddenly say something about . his
'poor mother.' He was a brave man,
for his thoughts were never about him
self, but always of cither his duty to
the department or his love for his
mother and his sister. He told me that
his suspicions were aroused by the fact
that the men wore rubber-soled shoes
and had no lights on their wheels, and
he determined to stop them and find
out who they were. He said that he
hardly expected trouble so early in the
cvenin?, but made up his mind to sat
isfy himself about the men. When he
stopped them he saw that they did not
answer his questions freely, and then
he told them to come with him to the
City Hall. The moment he said that
one of the men opened fire. Smith re
turned the nre and seemed to think he
hit the man v.ho had not done the
Ehooting at him.
At the hoppitjil no one was allowed to
see the dyins policeman except the
doctors, the relatives, and those who
took his dying statement. But to Po
lice Captain Petersen, Smith talked
fr^c-ly while he was being taken to the
Receiving Hospital. This is what Cap

"That was the last word we had until
I talked to Jim to-hight when he was
dying at the Receiving Hospital."
Policeman Smith was appointed a
regular patrolman on November 13.
1901. For seven years before, his ap
pointment he had been in the employ
of the, Oakland Transit Consolidated.
He was the son of the late James H.
Smith, a prominent attojiiey of this
city, who died several months ago. The
young man's mother survives. He was
unmarried and a brother to Police
Judge Mortimer Smith, William B.
Smith, Arthur C. Smith, Miss Julia
Smith, a teacher In the Grant School,
and Mrs. Wallace Stevenson. His birth
place was in Pennsylvania and he was
33 years of age. His home was with
his mother at 486 Twenty-seventh
street.
There is little doubt that the dead
burglar and his escaped partner are
the men who have been doing all of
the big robberies in Oakland recently.
The dead man was equipped for a burg
lary Job and every part of his clothing
Indicated that he had done euch work
before. He was dressed in dark trous
ers, a brown tweed coat of different
material, a red and green striped
sweater and rubber-soled shoes with
leather tops, much like sprinting shoes.
Across the tops and sides of these shoes
were scratches that grave Indication
that the wearer had been climbing up
or sliding down porch /columns. In the
pockets were many loose cartridges,
and a dirk in a sheath was found at
tached to his belt. -*...
The only Identification mark was the
name "Goldstein" upon his shirt. Chief
of Police" Hodgkins said to-night:
BUBGLABS FBOM THE EAST.
"The men were good workers and
apparently from the East.
"Jim told me he was going to stay
on duty to-night an hour later than
usual because there were porch-climb
ers about and he was out to get them
if he could. I replied, 'Be careful, Jim,
or they'll get you.' 'I expect to get one
to-night.' replied my brother and I
again cautioned him."
" 'If they do get me,' he said, 'I'll get
them; you mark my word/
AUTOPSY IS HELD.
, An Immediate autopsy was held at
the Morgue to-night in the case of Po
liceman Smith. Coroner Mehrmann di
rected the examination, and with him
were Dr. O. D. Hamlin, Dr. J. M. Kane.
Dr. George Reinle, Dr. Rice, Dr. Med
ros. Dr. R. T. Stratton and District At
torney John J. Allen. Two bullet
wounds were found, the fatal mlSsilf
having penetrated the left side below
the nipple, puncturing the portal vein
and causing a severe internal, hemor
rhage. The other bullet entered the
back through the left shoulder blade.
Smith was a fearless and conscien
tious peace officer.- ' Though he ' 'had
been on the police force but two years,
he had on a number of occasions shown
conspicuous bravery. At the Arcata
House fire last July he imperiled his
life to arouse sleeping lodgers, some of
whom he carried out of the burning
Btructure through'smoke and flames to
a place of safety.
On July. 7, two nights' after the fire,
Smith broke into H. W. Kleinenbroich's
jewelry, -store,- 538 Fourteenth street,
where a burglar lay hidden behind a
breastworks' of counters, and captured
his man single-handed:' This occurred
at 11 o'clock at night. Andrew Moller,
the burglar, was sentenced to the State
penitentiary. For his courage Smith
received a valuable gold locket from the
jeweler as a testimonial of his bravery.
Not four hours before the fatal duel
to-night the brave, young officer was
in conversation with hiÂ» brother, W. B.
Smith, a clerk in the employ of the
Contra Costa Water Company. It was
as if each had a premonition of the
coming event, for the brother said to
night: Â¦ Â« â¢
; FELT THE DANGEB.
To his mother he said: "Don't get ex
cited, mamma, and look out for Ida.
Good-by."
" 'I firmly believe I am going to die.
I want to make the same statement I
made before.' "

sign his name, I at his request and in
his presence sign his name and he
made his mark. Everett J. Bjrown.

"I will swear. I am going to die. I
met two men on Madison street. They
passed me and were leading two
wheels without lights. I watched them.
They went up as far as Thirteenth
street and then they turned down
toward Jackson. I ran across the street
and headed them off at Fourteenth and
Jackson streets. I stopped them and
got to talking to them and from their
talk I knew they did not belong here,
so I told them I was going to take
them up to the police station. One of
them stepped off about two feet and
shot me.. I shot at the other fellow.
They say I killed him. I hope I did. I
make this statement thinking I am go
ing to die."
Mr. Van Court asked: "Do you know
which one it was that shot you?"
The dying man replied: "It was not
the one I shot, but the one that got
away. He was the farthest from me.
He started to run. He Immediately
shot a second time. I said, 'My God,
I'm shot,' and then I shot the other fel
low. I shot, I think, five times. He
started down Fourteenth street, toward
Madison. I tried to go upstairs in that
house, but I fell on the steps and be

die. but I hate to go on account of my
mother. I want everything I have got

Just before death the officials took
the victim's dying statement, which
was as follows:

seen as they dodged about in the sand,
and the farmers, most of whom were
armed -with double-barreled shotguns,
opened fire on them.
Neldermeyer received a charge full in

his face and into his_ eyes, blinding him
so that he^could hardly rise. A shot
grazed Vandine's head, carrying off
sonvj of his hair, and his ; wounded leg
was weakened."- The posse was closing
in on all sides and the murderers sur

They were at once handcuffed, placed
upon a train and hurried to Chicago.
They were taken from the train and in
a patrol wagon were hurried to the
City Hall. They were taken- into the
office of Chief of Police O'Neil and

Colored Soldiers Are
Sent to Dislodge
Outlaws.
| PLAINS. Mont.. Nov. 27.â There is
I every indication of trouble between the
colored troops sent up to the reserva
tion to eject Joe Morrigeau and his
band of outlaw Nez Perces Indians,
Â¦who are said to be supporting Morri
geau. ' .
The troops arrived at 3:30 o'clock this
morning and an hour later were loaded
into wagons and started on the forty
mile drive to the Little Bitter Root.
Three hours later Government officers
came in by another trail and reported
that Morrigeau was still on the reser
vation and defiant. They state that the
Indian police positively refuse to at
tempt to eject the cattlemen, owing to
their fear of the Nez Perces.
The Nez Perces are a band of about
100, under Chief Carrier Slater, and
have been located in isolated sections of
the Flathead reservation* for the last
year. They refuse to recognize the Fed
eral officers or the Indian police and
have staved off the Flatheads for
months.
Morrigeau has engaged the band to
assist him, and unless Major Torrey and
his soldiers get hold of the cattle be
fore the Nez Perces are brought up,
trouble is v bound to occur.
The troops sent out from Fort Mls
soula are all veterans and picked fight
ers and are expected to, easily outclass
twice their number of Nez Perces.
A courier arrived at Plains at 7
o'clock this evening to report that the
troops were within two hours* march of
the Morrigeau camp and had halted for
the night.

SAN JOSE, Nov. 27.â George M. Bow
man, a banker and one of the most
prominent men In Santa Clara County,
died suddenly this morning at his home
at 4S0 North First street. As he started
to dress this morning he was stricken
with apoplexy and a physician was
summoned, but before he arrived Bow
man was dead. Bowman complained of
not feeling well yesterday, but no seri
ous .result was anticipated. Six years
ago he had suffered a light stroke of
apoplexy.
Bowman was of the First
National Bank of this city, president
and general manager of the Golden
Gate Fruit Packing Company and a di
rector and former president of the
Chamber, of Commerce. Few men were
more closely connected with the com
mercial life of San Jose or had a wider
acquaintance. He was a native of Du

.was a graduate from Cornell College at

National Democrats who are watch-
Ing the situation within the party think
that Cleveland's only chance of nomi
nation is by means of a stampede.
They say that he cannot be an active
candidate and that he must continue to
decline. Then should a prolonged con
test among other candidates come Into
the convention a stampede for him Is
not Impossible, and should this be the
outcome they say his friends will in
sist upon his accepting.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 27.â National
leaders of the Democratic party in
Washington when told to-night that
Cleveland had issued another declin
ation of nomination for the Presidency
did not consider that it put him in a
new position.
Senator Gorman did not care to dis
cuss the matter in any form and Rep
resentative McClellan, Mayor-elect of
New York, also declined to make a
6tatement. There was a singular dis
inclination among other Democrats of
national reputation to be quoted on
Mr. Cleveland's attiude, but all con
sidered his new announcement perfect
ly consistent and but a reiteration of
others of a similar character. / It is not
thought here that the complete elimi
nation of Mr. Cleveland will have any
effect upon the chances of Judge Par
ker, except so far as it makes one less
candidate.
Mr. Cleveland has carefully abstained
from saying definitely heretofore
whether he would allow his name to
be presented to the convention. When
the question has been put to him he
has avoided a direct answer and on
this account the Impression has grown
that he might become the Democratic
standard bearer. The chief opposition
to him has come from the Bryan wing
of the party.
Although very popular with the peo
ple. Mr. Cleveland has unfortunately
not been a favorite>with the party ma
chine leaders and realization of their
determined opposition probably In
fluenced his decision.
NEW YORK. Nov. 27.â Former Presi
dent Grover Cleveland announces un
conditionally and irrevocably to-day
that he would not be a candidate for
the Democratic" nomination for the
Presidency in the next Democratic con
vention. In view of the desire first ex
pressed by the Democratic leaders in
New Jersey last summer and since then
repeated in ma-sy parts of the country
that Mr. Cleveland would permit him
self, to be considered a candidate for
the Presidency, his decision aroused a
great deal of interest among political
leaders of both parties to-night. The
opinion was freely expressed that its
effect would be to increase the chances
of Alton B. Parker, Judge of ihe Court
of Appeals, for whom a strong prefer
ence has been shown in the South, and
for whom it is known Tammany Hall
has great admiration.
The announcement of Mr. Cleveland's
unwillingness to be a candidate was
made In a letter to St. Clair McKelway
and published In the Brooklyn Eagle.

Officer Tells How 2Â£agazine Articles
"Were Prepared to Beflect on
the Tomer Gov
ernor.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 27.â The Sen!
ate Committee on Military Affairs to- i
day heard Major James E. Runcie of I
Havana, probably the most important I
withers that will be offered by the op- !
ponects it General Leonard Wood in !
their attempt to prevent his confirma
tion to be major general. Major Runcie
Â¦was en the stand several times during
the day, telling the committee of a din- J
r;er at Santiago, Cuba, attended by !
himself. General Wood and Ray Stan- '
nard Baker, a newspaper man, at j
Â¦which it is alleged was planned the j
magazine article attacking Major Gen- !
cral Brooke that has figured so con- !
spicuously in the Wood case. Major J
Runcie was stopped more than once
during the course cf his testimony and
told to give nothing but facts of which
he had personal knowledge. This d^l
not exclude his story of the dinner In
cident, which resulted in the issue of
Fubpenaes for three other witnesses,
among whom is General Brooke.
In his testimony Major Runcie ex
plained that he had acted as the confi
dential adviser of General Wood for '
nearly two years and that they lived
together ct Santiago. It was v.hi'e
they were living in the same house that
Baker went to Santiago in search of
material for a magazine article. A j
meeting was arranged betv.-een the men i
ard a dinner followed, testified Major Â¦
Huncie, at which they discussed the !
T-lan to have published an article whiclr
v.ould exploit the success of General
Wood in dealing with affairs air San
tiago and draw a comparison with the
situation at Havana unfavorable to the
administration of General Brooke.
Major RuncSe declared that General
Wood asked him to vrrite the article
and that he had done so. The -article |
was given to Baker and published in
February, lÂ£Â»00. over the name of Ma
jor Runcie. He asserted that General :
Wood kr.ew what the article contained i
and that the^ had correspondence :
about it as a result of,the furor creat- i
c-d by its publication. He offered to j
produce conies of letters v.-hich he had !
written to General Wood concerning his j
town defense. It was not until General j
Wood succeeded General Brooke that j
.the anicle was published. The effect j
v.as a severance of the relations be- I
tv.een the witness and General Wood. ;
Major Runcie then began the practice
Of law at Havana and according to his
testimony has there ever since.
The witness said that when the Sec
retary of War went to Cuba following
the disclosures to.. the War Department
the suggestion was made, either by the
Secretary or Genera.1 Wool, that he be
bdort-snartlaled for writing the article^
and that he had. in effect, invited the
court-martial.
The committee informed Major Run
cie that he vrould be called again Borne
time next v.eek. He left Washington
to-night for Cleveland. H* is expected
to return within three days and hold
himself subject to the call of the com
mittee. His connections In Havana
make it necessary for him to appear
before the committee to testify con
cerning matters other than the writing
of the magazine article. It is said he
has knowledge cf. General Wood's or
der for the arrest of Major Rathbone
and as the agent at Havana for a Mary
land bonding company can give Infor
mation in regard to Rsitbbone'e charge
that General Wood used his influence
with the courts In having his fRath
bene's) bond fixed at a figure he de
clared to have been unreasonable.

cfcurrfce* la evanclirtlc wort
The President, with Mrs. Roosevelt,
alighted at the main entrance and went
quickly Into the house. There was lit
tle excitement, the occasion barring
any demonstration. The crowd was so
large by the time the cortege reached
the church that ingress or egress on
the avenue was practically impossible.
Just prior to the arrival of the cortege
a police Inspector noticea a man stand-
Ing on the structure, leaning over the
east railing directly over the entrance
to the church. The man was ordered
''away after he had returned an Insolent
answer, to thejnspector's question and
departed. While the man was presum
ably a curiosity seeker who had merely
wished to get a vantage point to see
the President, the crowd, impressed by
the elaborate police protection, looked
upon the Incident as a possible | plot
against tho President, but there was no
further disturbance. .
After completing an Investigation
Around the entire block patrolmen
were placed at frequent Intervals,
shutting off all traffic from Fifth ave
nue to Sixth avenue on Twentieth and
Twenty-first streets. The middle of the
street was kept open and the crowd,
which assumed large proportions in a
short time, was kept close to the side
walk. No one was allowed In the mid
dle of the street.
After breakfasting at the Robinson
home the President went to the late
residence of Mr. Grade in East Forty
eighth street, remaining there, until
time to go to the Church of the -Holy
Communion for the funeral service. At
the head of the cortege were carriages
containing the pallbearers. Then came
a carriage containing the President and
Mrs. Roosevelt. With them in the car
riage was a central office detective ser
geant and a secret service man and a
secret service man rode on the box
with the driver. The hearse followed
with carriages containing the other
mourners. Policemen were lined along
at very frequent intervals. The 'same
cordon of mounted police escorted the
President that had been detailed for
the ride from the ferry.
The police arrangements for the pro
tection of the President and the re
straint of the large crowd were very
efficient, more than three hundred pa
trolmen being on duty about the block
on which the church is located.
On the west side of Sixth avenue,
opposite the church, there was a solid
line of patrolmen, standing shoulder to
shoulder for a block, and on the east
side a similar detail of men.
AMPLE POLICE GT7ABD.
It is said that Deming is the man
who, on Mav 19, 1900, appeared at the
House of Representatives In Washing
ton and startled the House by suddenly
shouting, from the gallery: ,"Halt, or
der bv the grace of the Lord, listen,"
and then, having received the desired
attention, proceeded to make a speech
to that branch of the United States
Congress. Three or four policemen
finally hustled him away and escorted
him outside the building. It Is also
"said that last April he appeared at the
White Star Line pier as J. P. Morgan,
Andrew Carnegie and others were sail
ing on the Cedric, and preached a ser
mon to them.
Deming was later . committed .-. to
Bellevue Hospital for examination as
to his sanity. He told the magistrate a
rambling story in which he said that
he was in the clothing business in Oak
land, Cal., for twelve years, but that
for the last twenty-one years he had
been in New York and vicinity. He
said he had met every President from
Grant to McKInley.
The officials at the detective bureau
said the man appeared to be perfectly
harmless and- rational upon every sub
ject except -that of his remedy. Noth
ing was found on him to injure any one.
Deming told the officers that he de
pended on God to guide him in his
business affairs.
PRESIDENT AT THE FUNERAL.
The funeral service was conducted by
Bishop Potter. Rev. Dr. Mottet. Rev. H.
F.Taylor, Rev. Howard K. Barlow and
Rev. Henry H. Washburn of Oyster
Bay. Among the floral offerings was a
cluster of roses and orchids sent by the
President.
INTRUDER A CRANK.
NEW YORK, Nov. 27.â President
Roosevelt came to New York to attend
the funeral of James King Grade,
whose late wife was a sister of the
President's mother. During the five
hours he was in the city he was sur
rounded by several hundred policeman
and a number of special officers, but an
apparently harmless crank managed
to elude their vigilance and handed to
the President a letter regarding a pan
acea which he claims he has discov
ered. The interview came as the Pres
ident was leaving the church. The
stranger said he was A. B. Deming of
170 Broadway and that he had a cure
for cancer, which he wished Emperor
William to try. He wanted President
Roosevelt to write a letter to the Em
peror recommending the cure. The
President was unruffled by the inci
dent. With Mrs. Roosevelt he entered
his carriage immediately and vas
driven to the Twenty-third street ferry
to take the train for Washington. Dem-
Ing was taken to the Tombs Police
Court. Before being arraigned he said:
"I don't know why the President did
not keep my !etter instead of handing
it over to a policeman. It is a charcoal
cancer cure that cannot fail. I wanted
President Roosevelt to write to Em
peror William recommending it to
him."

"The universal exposition of 1904." he
said, "will be the sensational climax of

the greatest triumph human genius has
yet achieved. To millions of its visitors
it will be an academy of learning and
inspiration and an inexhaustible source
of genuine delight, and the memories

Representative Hepburn introduced a

same measure which was reported last

Representative Patterson of Tennes-
There was a party alignment of the
vote on the motion to adjourn over, the
Democrats voting against it.
Meyers of Iowa called up his resolu
tion providing for the acceptance of
the invitation of the members of the
House to be present at the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition celebration in
New Orleans, but objection was made
to its. consideration.
Bartholdt of Missouri was granted
unanimous consent to make an address
on the Louisiana Purchasa Exposition,
to be held In St. Louis next year. He
reviewed what had been accomplished
and what was being provided for the
public.
De Armond of Missouri also criticized
the Republican majority for its course.
Payne of New York, on whose request
unanimous consent was given for de
bate on the motion to adjourn over, re
plying to the opposition, took occasion
to say that the Republicans would
hardly care to take up the question of
tariff revision and disturb conditions
on the eve of a Presidential campaign.
He also said the time was not oppor
tune to consider reciprocity with Can
ada.
WASHINGTON', Nov. 27.â The House
met to-day and adjourned until Tues
day. The proceedings were marked by
a debate on the motion to adjourn over,
during which the minority took *ie Re
publicans to task for not proceeding to
the transaction of business. Williams
of Mississippi, the minority leader, pro
tested against the inactivity of the
House, asking If the majority were
afraid to trust themselves. He said
that while the Speaker had not been
able, as he knew, to name fell the com
mittees, yet there were matters which
the Ways and Means Committee, al
ready organized, could consider, citing
among other things the resolutions re
lating to Canadian reciprocity.
SALT LAKE, Nov. 27.â After a con
ference between Governor Wells and
Messrs. Evans and Kelliher, national
organizers of the United Mine "Work
ers of America, the Governor and Col
onel E. F. Holmes, president of the
Commercial Club, began efforts to
bring about a conference between the
officials of the Utah Fuel Company and
their striking miners in Carbon Coun
ty. Kelliher and Evans come as the
personal representatives of John Mit
chell and In their talk with the Gov
ernor brought out a new phase of the
strike situation. They maintain that
recognition of the union is a subordi
nate issue and that 20 per cent increase
In wages is the principal issue at stake.
They also declared that the Utah
miners are striking because of griev
ances of their own and they will go
back to work when these are rectified,
regardless of what the Colorado miners
may do. Their statements were in
radical variance from those of the Utah
Fuel Company officials.
In a telegram to the Commercial
Club President Mitchell declares his
willingness to meet representatives of
the coal company and arrange an
amicable settlement. To clear the sit
uation and arrive at the facts in the
matter, Governor Wells to-night sent
a telegram to President Kramer of the
fuel company, asking him to confer
with a delegation of miners. At a late
hour to-night no reply to this telegram
had been received by the Governor. .

PRINCETON, N. J.,
Nov. 25, 1903.â My
Dear Mr. Kehvay: I
have wanted for a long
time to say something
which I think should be said
to you before others. You
can never know how grate
ful I am for the manifesta
tion of kindly feeling to
ward me on the part of my
countrymen which your ini
tiative has brought out.
Your advocacy in the Eagle
of my nomination for the
Presidency came to me as a
great surprise; and it has
been seconded in such man
ner by Democratic senti
ment that conflicting
thoughts of gratitude and
duty have caused me to hesi
tate as to the time and man
ner of a declaration on my
part concerning the subject
â if such declaration should
seem necessary or proper.
In the midst of it all, and
in full view of every consid
eration presented, I have
not for a moment been able,
nor am I now able, to open
ymy mind to the thought that
in any circumstance or upon
any consideration I should
ever again become the nom
inee of my party for the
Presidency, j My determina
tion not to do so is unalter
able and conclusive.
This you, at least, ought
to know from me, and I
should be glad if the Eagle
were made the medium of
its conveyance to the public.
Very sincerely yours,
GROVER CLEVELAND.

BEGAL SHOES.
sphere are 20 Regal Shoe stores in
the Metropolitan District of New
York, are new this year â some
have been running for ten years. They
are all busy. On an average, there are sold in New
York five pairs of Regal Shoes every minute of every
working day in the year.
Now if all these shoes were not satisfactory, don't
you suppose we would have had "kicks" enough 0 ,
long before this, to have lifted us clear up over "the
Liberty statue and out to sea?
The reason we are here, and growing every hour,
is because the Regal is " the 'shoe that proves " â it is
the shoe that makes good.
When we tell you that the Regal is a $6 shoe for
$3.50 we know what we are saying, and we are prepared
to prove it: Regal style is self-evident â you can judge
it in our windows. â¢ The purchase of one pair at $3.50
will allow you to test the fit and wear. That's what
we want.
Th^re are 60 Regal Stores â 20 of tfcem in Greater New
York,i where the styles originate. The new styles are on sale in
our San Francisco store at the same time as in the New York
stores. Other dealers get the same styles a year later.

day wandered into a rabbit hunter's
camp a few miles from the' ranch with
a bullet wound in his head. He was
without, shoes or coat and his clothing
was damp from the dense fog. He was
demented and has since been unable
to offer any explanation save that in
occasional half lucid intervals he has
said that he was set upon by Uvo men
who demanded his shoes and his money
and discharged two' shots at him. Be
sides the wound in his head he has a

pon, probably a razor, and numerous
bruises on his back. Â«
On , Monday last Zehnder left the

miles and then -.left his 'horse to walk
across country to the railroad. From
that time until he; wandered into the
hunter's camp Thursday he had not

was set upon by tramps. He was
brought to this city and the physicians
attending him express little hope for
his recovery;} Exposure in his half

VALLEJO, Nov. 27.â Thirty cents a

high orice- of the necessaries of life,
generally, have provoked a protest fronf
Rev. R. L. MacFarlane of the Mission
of the Holy Spirit.
In hir Thanksgiving sermon Dr. Mac-
Farlane said: "Even though our land
has^Vielded abundantly of fruits and
vegetables there is cause for discon
tent, Inasmuch as a combination of
wVjlesale and retail dealers has con
spired to so increase the price of the
necessaries of life as to place them be
yond the reach of the poorer and hum
bler classes. Notably has this been the
case in San Francisco, and the same is
true in Vallejo. We have abundant
cause for discontent when we see men.
for their own aggrandizement, corner
ing triese gifts whichHSod has "bestowed
on us, denying us the actual' necessar
ies of life. I wouM heartily recommend
that throughout this State where this
condition of perfidy is to be found that
there should be . formed consumers'
leagues and consumers' unions, so that
we shall not suffer for the f^cessaries
of liL- to p*tisfy the greed of men.
What is true' in regard to the manipu
lation of the harvest yield through the
perfidy of some men Is true also.in the
commercial world. The consumer is
being oppressed to-day as he never was
expressed in days gone by. ;

Mrs. Hastings then filed a bond on
appeal, but this has been dismissed as
stated.
The long-continued contest over the
ownership of the . thoroughbred Harry
Thatcher was finally compromised to
day after nearly two years of lighting
in the" courts. A document was filed
with the County Clerk to-day, signed
by "Long Willie" Johnson and Mrs.
Anna Hastings, the contestants over
the possession of the horse, agreeing to
the dismissal of all the proceedings
pending in' the case.
Harry Thatcher is a well-known race
horse on the" Western circuits. He won
a race last Monday at the Emeryville
track, beating Dr. Bernays, Rose of
May. Red Tip and Max Bendix, and
came home an easy winner at odds of
4 to 1. He was entered in a distance
race yesterday and came In in the ruck.
T.wo yeat? ago he was given by John
son, to Mrs. Anna Hastings as security
for a board bill and money bompred
by Johnson. He claimed that he gave
her the horse to run, with the under
standing that when the animal won
sufficient races to pay the debt he was
to get him back again. Mrs. Hastings
claimed that the horse was given her
without contingency. While Mrs. Hast
ings claimed Johnson owed her 5350, it
was shown the horse had won $1200.
The examination of the accounts of
stabling and pasturing took up much
time, but Judge Ogden finally decided
the case in favor of Johnson.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 27.â Brigadier
General Tasker H. Bliss in his annual
report as president of the army war
college says detailed study of the mili
tary problems confronting the United
States should form an important part
of the work of the college, under the
direction of the chief of staff. General
Bliss recommends the elimination from
the duties of the college of "the collec
tion of military information." He also
would eliminate any special study of
material of war, which, while im
portant enough, he does not consider
within the proper scope of the war col
lege. General Bliss recommends that
a number of officers be" selected at
stated intervals for the study and the
wprklng out of a great war game. The
officers chosen, he says, should be se
lected from those who would play an
important part in the execution of
: plans adopted in the event of war. In
the selection of officers for post schools
General Bliss thinks that no difference
should be made in the cases of West
Point graduates.
General Bliss urges that every en
couragement be given to the officers of
the organized militia to pursue the
course of study laid down for the post
schools, and says that "in this way
the schools will perform the additional
function of insuring the maximum
number of trained regimental officers
for our large improvised armies in
times of war."

SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 27.â Frank Hall
of SanQFrancisco appealed to the au
thorities of this city to-day to assist
him in searching for his runaway wife.
He stated that she had eloped with a
man whose name he refused to divulge
and that he had reason to believe they
were touring Marin County in an auto
mobile.
Hall's story was to the effect that
his wife left their home in San Fran
cisco on Thursday after announcing
that she was going to visit a friend.
When she did not return at the usual
hour he commenced a search for her
and learned that she came to this city.
He next heard of her being seen here
in an automobile with the man with
whom she had eloped.
The local authorities were unable to
find any trace ol' Mrs. Hall, her com
panion or the automobile. If the couple
crossed to this side of the bay they
must have continued on to Petaluma or"
some other point in Sonoma County,
for it is almost certain that they are
not in Marin County.

sue of the 500 shares of treasury stock
and we now hona that everything will
go along iii?a smooth manner."
"Yes, we^have settled everything
amicably. We held a meeting of the
Directors to-day and I tendered my
resignation as/ president and Mr. tur
pin did the same as vice president. We
decided that the interests of the bank
would best be served by not having
any friction 'or Qltigation, so We de
cided to withdraw the suit
and come to an amlcffele settlement.
. A suit to determt-te the sale of the
500 shaVes of treasury stock was filed,
but It was dismissed on nation of the
defendant^ directors. Then Truman and
Turpin sought an injunction to re
strain the other directors^ from inter
fering with them in their'posltlons as
president and. vice president. This is
the suit that'w'u's withdrawn yester
day. .
I. J. Truman made the following
statement last evening: v ,
The next step was taken a few days
ago, when Truman and Turpin were
ousted from their. positions by a con
trolling vote of the issued stock. J. H.
Swift was elected president and Allen
Griffiths vice president and Truman
and Turpin evoked the aid r of the
courts. Q) â¢
The directors of the Columbian
Banking Company have settled their
differences and the suit instituted by
I. J. Truman and F. L. Turpin to re
strain their brother directors from In
terfering, with them in their duties as
president and' vice president respect
ively of the corporation was withdrawn
yesterday when the case was called be
fore Judge Hebbard.
. For some time Truman, the presi
dent, and Turpin, vice president of the
bank, held 1339 shares of the 2500 shares
Issued, thus~ giving them the control
of the board of directors. The balance
of the issued shares was* neld by Di
rectors CO. Perry, J. H. Swift, Al
len Griffiths, T. O. Sadlier and Thomas
E. Haven. The unissued shares of the
bank, amounting to 7500, remained in
the treasury. .
Dissatisfaction was felt some months
ago at the manner in which Truman
and Turpin were conducting the af
fairs of the banking company and the
directors decided to depose them. Five
hundred shares of the treasury stock
were ordered issued by the majority of
the directors," the same' being sold to
Allen Griffiths. 3y this move the di
rectors opposed to Truman and Tur
pin secured sufficient s-.'ock to control
the board. , '

The petition of J. C. Bates that af
fidavits of . publications of resolutions
and notices of street work be furnished
was referred to the Board of Works
for action.
The Board of Works was granted au
thority to pave New Montgomery
street, between Market and Mission,
with asphalt, at an estimated cost of
$13,560.
I Permission was granted to the Board
of Works to construct at an estimated
cost to the city of $11,500 a .six-inch
fewer in Thirty-seventh avenue, south
of the new pesthouse site to the bay
shore, and also a roadway leading to
the Flte and the grading of a portion
thereof.
The committee postponed action on
the matter until next Thursday In or
der to make a personal investigation
of the route of the proposed spur track.
The Street Committee recommended
the passage of a resolution lowering
the prade of Golden Gate avenue, at
its intersection with Jones and Leaven
worth streets, and authorizing the
Board of Works to proceed with the
work.
Garret McEncrney. attorney for !
Archbishop Riordan. scored the Board
of Public Works for refusing to grant
the permit.
"We wish to lay this track under au- ;
thority granted by the Board of Super- i
visors." said McEnerney. "and we have
been delayed and prevented from doing |
so by the Board of Works, which denies ,
our request for a permit. I represent a j
charitable Institution that takes care of j
the pick free. The objections to the j
t-pur track and the reasons for the ob- ;
Jectinns arÂ» the same as have been :
urged for the last 500 years. We will |
have a larger city and the teamsters j
will do more business than when the j
mules carried- water in leather jars ;
around the city. Anything that will j
cheapen the cost to the <-onrumer will j
be a benefit. The owners of the ware- j
house were not so insane, as to get a j
permit for a spur track so that the !
teamsters could not get in and out of j
the warehouse as the representatives
of the teamsters say."
MUST PAVE STREET.
'There is an tirdinanee." said Casey,
'â¢which requires holders of spur track
privileges to pave the space between
the rails and tv.o feet on either side."
"We are aware of that condition," re
plied McEnerney, "and \*e will comply
with all requirements this board may
prescribe."
" "For my part," said Chairman Curtis
of the committee, "I do not like to see
this corporation ringled out for taking
away a privilege already granted. We
have issued many permits for spur
tracks and. to my mind we have not the
power to discriminate unless there are
weighty reasons for so doing. It stems
to me that if A\e repeal this particular
privilege we would be' compelled to re
peal all similar privileges."
It developed durLng the meeting that
the Board of Public Works itself on
November T. 190L had recommended
that the petition of St. Mary's Help
Hospital be granted, with the amend
ment, however, that the epur track be
laid on Filbert street instead of on
Sansome, â¢ as originally petitioned for
by the corporation. On the declaration
of the Board of Works that the tracks
could be laid on Filbert street with less
hindrance to traffic the Supervisors
passed the ordinance granting the spur
track privilege; I
WILL INVESTIGATE ROUTE.
R, I. Wisler, secretary of the Labor
Council, stated that the granting of the
j.rivilepe to lay the spur track would
result in driving a number of men out
of the teaming busings? a.Â« the ware
houses wou'd use the track to the ex
c lusion of teams. Michael Casey, presi
dent of the Teamsters' Union, and
president of ;he Board of Works, also
Â«.ppoged thP granting of the privilege
for the same reasons, and also that too
much of th? street would be occupied
by the track, causing a menace to
teaming.
WOULD HURT TEAMSTERS
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors held a lively session yes
terday over the consideration of the
petition of the San Francisco Labor
Council to annul the privilege hereto
fore granted to Archbishop P. W. Rior
dan as president of the St. Mary's Help
Hospital, a corporation, to lay and
maintain a spur track to connect the
Gibraltar warehouse at the southeast
corner of Filbert and Sansome streets
with the belt railroad. The warehouse
property was left by the late Mrs. Kate
Johnson for the benefit of the hospital,
which is to be erected on Guerrero
street.
Notwithstanding that the Board of
Supervisors, by ordinance regularly
passed, ordered thf Board of Works to
grant permission for the spur, the lat
ter body refuses to issue a permit on
the pretext that a protest has been filed
apainst it. Supplementary to the pro
tert of the Labor Council the City
Front Federation, of which John Kean
is secretary, filed a communication fa
vnrinp the repeal of the ordinance. The
federation says in the petition that "it
does not wish to stand in the way of
improvements, but the fact that the
ordinance granting the privilege has
r.ot beer, acted upon for two years
Fhould be r>roof that it is an unneces
sary morn-poly of Filbert street over
which it Is intended to lay the spur
track. The federation objects on the
further ground that it will deprive a
large number of men Â»of employment,
the men affected being members of the
federation, and further protests
aqainrt the granting of a monopoly in
the interest of one (o the detriment c-f
many."
"Juries," continued the Judge, "have
no right to make -themselves the par
doning power of the State. In this case
the defendant had repeatedly threat
ened to kill the woman; he had hired
apartments where he could be within
reach of her and the night before the
murder he had purchased a pistol to
carry his threat into execution. If ever
there was a case of lying In wait mur
der.this was one, and as I said before,
it was murder in the first degree with
out a mitigating circumstance. If the
death penalty was not for such a case
then the statute ought- to be repealed.
It is through such a miscarriage of
justice that men are instigated to com
mit crimes of this sort. I would not be
justified in the circumstances in giving
the defendant any Consideration what
ever, but for the sake of his family, es
pecially his aged mother. I am inclined
to grant the request made by counsel."
, The Judge ordered the defendant to
spend the rest of his natural life In
San Quentin. A stay of ten days was
asked, but the Judge would only allow
five days.
The Judge said it would be only out
of consideration for the defendant's
mother for him to listen to any request.
At the time the verdict was rendered
he felt that it was a case In- which, the
jury having found a verdict of murder
in the first degree, there could be but
one punishment adequate under the
law. If the jury had Drought in a
verdict of murder in the. second de
gree, as it was in their province to do,
he would have certainly felt that they
had conscientiously performed their
duty and he would have pronounced
sentence accordingly, but where the
verdict was murder in the first de
gree and there could be no possible
mitigating circumstance to Justify a
reduction In the punishment it seemed
to him a travesty on justiceâ a gross
miscarriage of justice in every sense
of the word.
Sentence of imprisonment for life as
fixed by the trial Jury was passed upon
Michael Nihill by Judge Cook yester
day for shooting and killing Mrs. Ben
efrieda Baker In a saloon at Howard
and Russ streets on April 21 last.
When the case was called Attorney
Alford for the defendant said he had
no legal cause to offer why judgment
should not be pronounced. He had sim
ply to request that the defendant be
sent to San Quentin Instead of Folsom
for the sake of the defendant's aged
mother and sisters.
ALAMEDA. Nov. 27.â General Man
ager Julius Kruttschnitt on behalf of the
Southern and Central Pacific railways
has refused to accept the two local
franchises as awarded to those cor
porations on the 2d of this month
by the City Trustees. His letter abso
lutely declining to accept the privileges
as granted was received to-day by City
Clerk James W. Gillosly. It leaves the
mat- r of the two franchises practically
in the same condition that they have
been since the South Pacific Coast Rail
way Company's twenty-five-year fran
chise expired last June. In his letter of
refusal Mr. Kruttschnitt says:
"An examination of the franchises In
question will disclose the fact that they
contain many unusual and burdensome
conditions on the part of each grantee."
He then refers to the provision that
local passenger service shall not be cur
tailed; that local stations shall not be
abolished without the consent of the
City Trustees; that single fares be
tween Alameda and San Francisco shall
not exceed 10 cents and between Ala
meda and Oakland a cents; that the
Central Pacific shall remove its tracks
from Railroad avenue, between Fifth
and Eighth streets; that single fares be
tween local stations shall not exceed
2H: cents, and that no freight except to
or from AJameda. or points between
Alameda and Santa Cruz be trans
ported over the local line between the
easterly boundary of the city and Ala
meda Point. Continuing Mr. Krutt
schnitt says:
"The concessions on the part of the
Southern Pacific Company are of the
highest value to the people of Alameda,
insuring the continuance of the present
very low local rates^ and placing them
on an exact equality with the city of
Oakland. Home of these concessions
Â¦ were reluctantly consented to by us.
but as we had Intended to remodel the
entire railroad system of Alameda so a3
to bring it up to the best modern stand
ard, we fert. after much consideration
' and discussion, that if the franchises
for a sufficiently long time to warrant
the contemplated expenditure were
granted, we would accept the incon
venience and submit to the limitations
which are so urcently demanded or.
your part. In all our conferences with
your representatives we distinctly
stated that the shortest, term we would
consider for franchises involving such
conditions was fifty years, and all of
the concessions made by us were well
understood to be based upon fifty
year terms.
"We desire to maintain friendly rela
tions with Alameda City and to main
tain therein a first-class modern rail
way system, operated In such a man
ner as to meet every reasonable re
quirement of her people, but we cannot
afford to incur the very large invest
ments necessary for that purpose under
the limitations and restrictions pro
posed by you for any shorter term than
that of the corporate existence of the
respective grantees named in the fran
chises.
"I bej? further to state that no fran
chises containing the special conditions
referred to will be accepted by either of
said companies. I most respectfully in
form you that the franchises, as finally
passed by you are not accepted. "With
much regret that the well-intended con
cessions offered by the said companies
have failed to obtain a reasonable re
sponse from you, I remain very re
spectfully yours,
"J. KRUTTSCHNTTT,
"Fourth Vice-President and General
Manager."
QUARREL OVER
RACEHORSE ENDS
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 27.â It is
stated that the Russo-Japanese diffi
culty so far as -Manchuria is concerned
has been tentatively settled by Japan
agreeing to recognize Russia's d.oml
nant interests there and not to interr
fere with them at present. This does
not imply a waiving of treaty rights,
the ultimate recognition of which, as
with all open ports and the integrity of
Chinese sovereignly, Japan requires. It
is alleged, however, that Japan is will
ing to leave these questions in abeyance
in order not to embarrass Russia.
In the meantime Japan's insistence
regarding the position of Korea is not
modified.

AFTER, THE DIVORCE
The ' Supervisors' Health Committee
met yesterday and formulated a repoit
to the board to the effect that after a
poll of votes taken among the residents
of the University Mound and Bay View
districts it finds that the sentiment is
overwhelmingly against the proposed
ordinance extending the limits within
which It Is prohibited to keep more
than two cows. The poll was taken to
determine the propriety of extending
the lirnits, and as the vote was four to
one against It; in all likelihood the or
dinance will not be passed.

GUAYMAS. Nov. 27.â The Barrio or
district of Salivazo in Guaymas is be
coming famous as a dueling ground
for Mexican cabelleros. who elect to
settle their disputes en the field of
honor. Two young men of the city had
b^en killed on the square in a month
and a third met a similar fate in the
yame place on Thursday night, al
though the police had been keeping
close watch on the ppot to prevent an
other trapedy.
Francisco Castro and Pablo Zam
brano, tv.-o young men of the middle
class, chose the early evening hour for
thrir mortal combat. Just exactly what
occurred may never be known, for
when the residents of the neighborhood
and officers, on hearing the shots, rush
ed to the scene, Castro was lying on
th* 5 pavement, the blood flowing from
a bullet wound in his Fide. Zambram
was standing near him like a statue,
holding a smoking revolver in his right
hand.
Castro was at once removed to the
municipal hospital, where he died.
Zambrano was immediately throvrn
into prison. Great, pressure was
brought to bear to secure, his release.
Inasmuch as it was proveii frofh a pis
tol found beside his opponent that
Zambrar.o had fought a fair fight, but
it proved of no avail. Zambrano re
alises to tell the officers how the affair
occurred or the cauFc of the quarrel
and there were no friends -or seconds
to witness the duel.
The authorities of the municipality
have issued orders to the police to keep
a constant watch over the Barrio del
Falivazo to prevent others from resort
ing to it as a dueling ground and
Zambrano v.i'.l be vigorously probecut

The prosperity, of the grain and food
producing populations North and West
and of the cotton, lumber and naval
stores Interests at the South is. in fact,
the chief basis for the conservative
confidence In the general business out
look- expresesd by many observers.
There are some good points even
among the Industries. Although iron
and* steel production Is limited and
shutdowns are numerous there Is a
rather better â¢ tone, particularly to
crude Iron, .due to the growth of the
feeling, that prices are now grounding
on the bottom. Lumber is quiet for do
mestic trade, but export demands is
active. "
In wholesale trade features are the
rather stronger tone for cotton goods,
which are held- more firmly by agents,
and a little better feeling In woolen
goods. The firmness of prices of agri
cultural products was another element
which is to be taken account of. The
agricultural Interests and those Inter
ested in distributive trade seem at
present to be having their innings and
appear .well, situated, whereas the
manufacturing and industrial branches
send forth nearly all of the pessimistic
reports.

WASHINGTON. Nov. 27.â The bat
tleship Maine has suffered another in-
Jury- The Inability of the ship to make
more than twelve knots on her recent
cruise to Colon was due to an accident
to her engines., which occurred before
her departure. Four of the large en
gines* "Y's," or supports, are broken,
and It will be necessary to repair them
before it will be safe for the Maine to
increase her speed beyond twelve knots,
although the vessel's maximum speed
is eighteen knots. The Navy Depart
ment officials assert that the vessel is
in no dancer if she does not exceed
twelve knots, but it Is admitted that
only an emergency would have caused
her dispatch on such a cruise In her
present condition.
Further on, in accounting , for the
manner In which Carter obtained his
money, the statement is made, "his
father-in-law, the late Robert W. West
cott, a millionaire of New York (whom
Carter first met in Sa\-annah), gave to
Carter between 1S31 and 1897, when
Carter was accused of wrong-doing, a
considerable amount . of spending
money, with which Carter lived much
beyond his salary as captain of en
gineers.
"The . receipts which Westcott took
from Carter for those bond' are now- in
evidence, and abundant written evi
dence Is now in goins to prove that
everything spent or had in Excess of
his salary came, from Westcott as gifts
to Carter at a time whenoWestcott
never left Carter without putting his
arms about him and kissing him/'
In the first paragraph it Is stated
that it Is not a rule to discuss pending
laws with the newspapers, "but the
Government has argued its case
against Captain Carter in the news
papers for so. many years, that even
those who are inclined to-be fair are
almost convinced that Carter's case Is
hopeless, especially as they have no
Idea of what his side of the case really
Is."
Although Carter refused so long Ld he
was in prison to -give out interviews, it
was said yesterday that he had no im
mediate plans for the future beyond
devoting his time to defending hi3 claim
to the bonds which the Government
has sued to recover from him. CThat
suit, it is said, will come up in Chicago
during the January term of the United
States court.
During the afternoon Carter sat down
at a typewriter arid for two hours was
busily engaged in copying a statement
prepared for him by his attorney, H. G.
Stone of Chicago, and signed by the

Interested parties with the announce
ment that tbe club was in a prosperous
condition and would daring the next

said this was done in recognition of the
great kindness done the club by the
holders of bonds, who refused to accept
Interest on the bonds for five years.

With two clubs holding tennis tour
naments once a month each the players
are engaged in tournament play the
greater part of the time. This is un
doubtably the livllest winter in tennis
circles on record. The California Club
has taken a new lease of life and big
changes are noticeable on the grounds.
The tournnament committee, which
was recently appointed for the year, Is
doing good work and the tournaments
are being handled in an efficient man
ner. The handicapping is another mat
ter the committee gives much time to
and the results on Thursday show the
time has not been wasted. The com
mittee is composed of Frank String
ham, Will Allen and Chester Smith.
Aonother man to whom. credit is due
for the pleasing state of affairs at the
club is John Oliver, the new court
keeper. Mr. Oliver has had consider
able experience in the East and Canada
and most of the improvements are due
to him. The club is filling up rapidly
and has almost reached, Its limit, of 200
members. It is ' expected there will be
a waiting list by the first of the year.
The handicap singles tournament,
commenced on the club courts Thurs
day, was the most successful held in
years. Eight players are left to com
pete to-morrow for the four prizes.
These eight represent all the different
classes and as the handicapping has
been carefully attended to all of them
should prove close.
Joseph S. Tobin, the old-timer, was
the star on- Thursday and many pick
him td'jvin to-day. Tobln Is an easy,
graceful player. He is. not brilliant,
but uses good judgment and is as
steady as a clock. He has only a small
handicap, but will make good use of it.
The men will oppose each other as
follows: Harry Rolfe (scratch) vs. Ray
Spilvalo (scratch); Joseph S. Tobin
(owe 2-6) vs. Will Allen (owe 15); Drum
mond MacGavin (owe 15) vs. Alden
Ames (15 4-6); Herbert Schmidt (owe
1-6) vs. Charles G. Kuehn* (4-6). \
-/ Spilvalo caused quite a surprise by
the game he put up Thursday. He* Is,
however, not in as 'good - practice as
Rolfe and. the latter ought to win.
The- match between Tobin and Allen
should 'prove the | best in this round.
Many 'think Tobin would stand a good
chance of beating Allen on even terms.
The latter will allow odds of "owe 4-6.".
He has shown his ; ability to play un
der, handicap conditions' many times in
the past. Toblri beat Mitchell with the
same odds and Mitchell is considered a
better! player than; Allen. v
MacGavln should beat Ames, but will
have a hard time doing so, as the odds
allowed are liberal. The Kuehn-

The managers of the various teams
will immediately proceed to get busy

2STEW IMMIGBANT STATION
PBOPOSED FOB THIS POST
United States Immigrant Commis
sioner Hart H. North returned yesterday
from Washington, where he had been at
tending a convention of immigrant com
missioners assembled to discuss ways
and means for the Improvement of the
service. The convention was brought to
an abrupt termination by the seizure of
Commissioner General Frank P. Sargent
with a stroke of apoplexy.
Hr.. North visited the Federal immi
grant stations at New York, Boston,
Winnipeg, Vancouver and Montreal to
ctudy the system of management at
those points. In response to the Joint
recommendation of Messrs. North and
Eargent, Senator Perkins has introduced
a bill in Congress to appropriate $200,000
for the erection of a,Federal immigrant
station on Ansel Island, and Mr. North
believes that the bill will certainly be
adopted. Included in the items of ex
pense are a wharf end a separate station
on the island for Chinese immigrants.

In the mixed doubles tournament on
Thursday two of the women players
showed up particularly strong. Theyl
are Miss, Hazel Hotchkiss and Miss
Ethel Ratcllffe, both of Berkeley. They
have improved ; , wonderfully, In. the last
year and if their improvenent is kept
up the north may hope to niake at least
a good showing against the famous
Suttons when they come hire again.
Schmidt match will probably be close.
If Schmidt plays a steady game he will
win, but if he is wild Kuehr>, who
makes few errors, will beat him. r
Play will commence to-morrow
morning at 10 o'clock. The final match
will be played at 2:30. The four reach
ing the semi-finals will receive prizes.
But little of the first and fourth
classes were played at the park last
Sunday on account of the -rain. The
park players have decided to postpone
their matches a week, owing . to the
fact that Allen and MacGavln. two of
the best men in the first class, will be
engaged at the California Club courts
to-morrow. The first class willgo over
until a week from to-morrow. The
fourth class will probably be finished
to-day.
The return match between the Oak
land and the San Francisco bowlers
last Thursday was a marked success.
San Francisco won again, but by a_
small margin. The home men did not
put In their strongest sixteen, but the
second sixteen proved Just strong
enough to beat out Oakland's sixteen
players. The latter showed great im
provement over their play of a few
weeks ago. It is the Intention of the
two clubs to hold many interclub meet
ings in the future.
The annual meeting of the San Fran
cisco Scotish Bowling Club will be held
next Thursday, when an election of of
ficers for the ensuing year will take
place. Arrangements will also be made
for another tournament. As the one
now all but finished is a single, prob
ably some other form of play will be
indulged In, either two or four on a
side.
The tournament that has been in
progress for several months will be
completed to-day, when the final match
will be played in Golden Gate Park.
The contestants will be James Gray
and J. C. Mofflt. Each has gone through
his half of the tournament cleverly and
the experts look for a close struggle.
It Will Possibly Be for Teams of
Either Two or Four /vg
Men.

trons of the sport in the United King
dom. Two puppies from their powerful
kennels were matched for a $500 trophy
last spring, but. the Duke of Leeds'

UNDER GOOD AUSPICES
STOCKTON, Nov. 27.â The bodies of
George Heimann Jr. and Fred Davis,
the two boys who wenO hunting
Wednesday porning but failed to re
turn, have been found. The bodies were
found this morning by B. S. Davis,
father of one of the unfortunate boys,
and Sheriff Sibley. They" were found
near the Dow Smith camp. Just below
the Oakland ranch dairy. The Heimann
boy wr.9 a son of George Heimann and
a student at the local High School. The
Davis lad was employed at the Wave
candy store. The young men started
hunting Wednesday morning and pro
ceeded down the north bank of the
channel on foot to-ithe landing opposite
the head of Rough and Ready Island,
where they borrowed a boat from an
arkman. That was the last seen of
them alive. When the boys failed to
return late Wednesday night the
parents became anxious, and a. search-
Ing party headed by Sheriff Sibley was
sent out. At Wakefleld a little girl was
found who stated that she had seen an
empty boat floating by. O
The boys had rowed the boat up the
Calaveras" River nearly two miles from
its mouth and had there evidently cap
sized it while shooting. Both bodies
were in shallow water, but were lying
on the bottom of the stream.' The hat
of one of the unfortunate young men
was found fast in some bushes and di
rected the searchers to the bodies. i

Plerpont Ordway outpointed John
Quincy Adams in a four-round mix-up.
Both men wanted to quit and stalled
about the ring till some one proposed
throwing a few soda bottles. Then
they did a little better, but not good
enough to make a fight out of the af
fair. Ordway won by doing most of
the rushing in the last two rounds.
Billy Donahue started off well In his
go with Jack Burke, but suddenly
Burke landed a wallop ln the region of
Donahue's stomach. Then the poor
fellow who was hit became offended
and walked away to the other end of
the ring, where he received a second
clout, this time on the Jaw. He told
the referee it was all right,' so in order
to accommodate him the bout was
stopped.
George Larkin gave Jack Nolan such
a beating in one round that the ref
eree called it off, as Nolan was all in.
Charles McChesney and George Henry
fought four great rounds as a curtain
raiser. Henry won because McChesney
could not stand the gaff.
ORDWAY OUTPOINTS ADAMS.
The bout^yhich preceded the prand
event lasted just about half a minute.
The opponents were Charles Augustus,
the cyclone, and Al Smith, the Her
cules. Hercules started in to cop hla
man ln a round or so, but Cyclone wal
loped him one ln the solar plexus and
poor Hercules went to the mat, stay
ing there for about five minutes.
Mlke^ynfy, the Greek, -won the de
cision over Charles Arthur of Los An
geles after four rounds of weird going.
Synfy had little regard for Arthur's
handsome visage and kept poking his
left there till the latter began to feel
ill. Once Arthur rallied and hit Synfy
a punch and for doing this the gallery
gods wanted to tout the Judges into
giving him the decision.
j Around the ring they went, nor did
ihey have any consideration for the
comfort of the onlookers. Every min
ute or so the gladiators burst through,
the ropes ,and fell in a heap on some
unfortunate who was not active
enough make a getaway. This sort of
thing kept right on for the entire four
rounds and the only time it varied was
when the principals became tired of
hitting at themselves and varied the
.monotony by making a pass or two at
Referee Greggains. They always land
ed on such occasions.
ROTJGH HOTJSÂ£ TACTICS.
Sullivan was also a big fellow, but
not so pronounced as his opponent,
When the gong sounded the bouncer
made a rush at his man and every one
In the. Jiouse felt sorry for poor Sulli
van". But somehow or other he man
aged to sidestep, and then began to
mr;il the pride of the City Front Fed
eration.
There have been tame battles and
gory battles and funny battles fought
in the little arena of the San Francisco
Athletic Club, but Manager Greggains
promoted a fight last night that was
absolutely the funniest thing that ever
came off inside any roped ring. The
performers were heavy-weights as far
as weight counted, but ln actual knowl
edge of the game they were real
tramps.
John King was the chief attraction,
and for an opponent he had Oliver Sul
livan, reputed to have arrived recently
from Gotham. Sullivan won a mile,
simply because King could not fight
with his fists, although he might have
been a wonder at the game if the
French rules were ln vogue on Sixth
street.
King has a lengthy record as a
bouncer In a sailors' boarding-house on
the water front and when he loomed
up in the ring the spectators thought
they beheld the coming wonder of the
age. He was at least six feet two and
weighed 400 pounds on an honest scale.
His legs were more like beer kegs than
anything else and his mitts were bo big
that the master of ceremonies was
forced to senc out for a special pair of
gloves in order that the fight might
go on. '^J

Take Another Game From Seattle,
Playing Much Better BalL
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 27.â Los An
pc-les won the fifth game of the series
from Seattle to-day by the score of 6
to 2 because they played much better
ball than the visitors. St. Vrain was
touched up for fourteen hits, but kept
them fairly well scattered. The Seattle
infielders were disposed to throw the
ball away and to their bad throwing
two runs for the locals are chargeable.
Cray was given perfect support by the
Los Anpeles team, and while the game
â¢was rather slow there was much bick
ering between the two teams. In slid
Ing for the home plate Wheeler said
Byers kicked him after touching him
out and when he got up he returned the
compliment. The umpire and Dillon
prevented possible hostilities by getting
between them. Score:

ANGELS STILL WINNING.
The water doIo match between two
teams from the Lurline Swimming Club
was excltine. Neither side scored a
point, but the goals were frequently in
danger. Starter "Jack" Gleason lost
his hat during the excitement and had
to return home In a straw headpiece.
The ofllcials were: Referee, William
Greer Harrison; starter, John J. Glea-
Bon; Judges, Max Rosenfeld and Wallle
Taylor; timers, "Tlv" Krellng and Alec
Pape: announcer, Fred Butz.
The special 100-vard race for mem
bers of the lurline Swimming Club
brought out .some crack swimmers. cWV
Stockton and>. Sunberg finished first
and second ln the first heat, making the
distance Jn 1:10. It was a pretty finish
and the young men were applauded.
Artie Young beat A. B. Schmidt in the
second heat. The pair trailed along
nicely for the first fifty yards and then
hit up'their strokes at the finish. Young
proved the stronger and won by a nar
row margin. The final heat was won
by Sunbere, Stockton second, and
Young third. Young had the rac^ well
in hand, but gave out i.ear the finish.
He pluckily finished close behind his
opponents. Young's forte Is long dis
tance swimming.
The novelty race was a funny event.
The entries had to swim to one end of
the tank and put on trousers and shirt,
then swim to the starting point and don
a coat and then return to the other end
and secure an umbrella and with up
lifted umbrella swim across the finish
ing line. Duckett finished first, with
Vecci a bad second and Riordan third.
Veccl was disqualified because he had
a valet at the other end of the tank.
The antics - of the young men while
dressing were exceedingly funny.
SUNBERG A WINNER.
"Babe_" Fay might have won the spe
cial 100-yard race from scratch but for
the fact that his brother received
eleven peconds handicap over him.
"Babe" went after C. V. dough, Harry
Duckett and his brother, but was un
able to overtake, them. He was forced
to stop when near the finish as. the ex
ertion was j ->o ereat. Duckett came
second. Tiie exact swimming time of
the winner was one minute and twenty
one seconds.- "Babe" Fay was going at
a 1:10 clip. He has the making of a
crack. He is new at the game and ran
grive Scott Leary, the club's champion.

Some el?ver diving was-done by mem
bers of the club asd of the Lurline
Swlmrr-Jng Club. Lester Hammer
smith Enured firjt prize by his" clean
cut wc-k. W. Pomln and W. Stockton
ran him a close race for tfie prize. Po
mln ar-1 Stockton were unused.to ths
springboard and were therefore handi^
c?r>ped. Hammersmith is conceded to
be one of the best divers in the West.
Ar hie Taylor's pjowu work created
a great deal of laughter. He took some
flops that wouM hurt an oi Jlnary man
:f he were not stuffed for the occasion.
The first race was a fifty-yard handi
cap for Olmpic Club swimmers. It
run off in three heats and the con
tests were highly exciting. Ferem and
Vfccl qualified ln the first heat. Pike
and Cumm!nj?s swam the distance ln 38
seconds in the second heat and Lidelt
and Wise beat their opponents in the
third heat. The final was won by Pike
in 37 seconds. Pike's handicap gave
him a slight advantage over Veccl. who
came second. Lidelt finished third.

It was easy enough for the Cripples
to win yesterday afternoon at Recrer
ation Park, as they played better ball
than did the natives. They also re
ceived much help from Mr. Campbell,
umpire, who may or may not appear
at the Eighth-street lot some other time.
Mr. Campbell was not there all ihe
time and in conseque-ce tÂ£te fans said
unkind things behind his back on sev
eral ocacsions. Score, 5 to 3.
Jack /O'Connell did r-t show, so"
Campbell longed for a tryout and was
accordingly given one. He got in
wrong during the first inning and
Misehow or other never * recovered
from the attack of diamond frigbt he
contracted so early in the crntest. His
chief deficiency was on balls and
strikes. He called the good balls er*d
the bad ones strikes, which, of course,
did not always please the players.
McKay really pitched better ball
than did Hodson and that <r the m-m
reason why the Cripples won. Then
they hit hard at the right moments and
had it not been for some slow base
running and other dummy work ; at
critical times the score would ha.'e
been much larger. As it was, enough
runs were made to skip in handily and
therefore old Peter had no reason t<v
complain. The score:

Judge', both shifty youngsters. The six
and a half furlong handicap will bring
together Hagerdon, Yellow Tail, Arabo
and Ishlar. In the mile and a sixteenth
handicap Dainty will try conclusions
with Bragg and the three-year-old colt
Horatius.
Last Knight, winner of the closing
race, was bid up $700 over his entered
selling price of $500 by Al Koenigsber
ger. Dan Lemasney retained the horse
with the usual bid.
Charley Murray lost Anvil, which
started favorite for the last event. The
three-year-old was in to be sold for
$500 and was claimed by J. T. Strite,
the owner of Iras. As Murray received
$1227 CO, counting his portion of the
boost money, second money from the
purse and the $825 Strite had to pay
the little gelding looks well sold.
Miss Betty, Shotgun and The^Mlghty
were all-ridden by Jack Martin, who is
now in great form.
Both Miss Betty and The Mighty are
from the stable of Garnet Ferguson,
"who has some clever two-year-olds.

A Dcscm Hermit.
I was fifty miles from the nearest
camp and as far frum water. Suddenly
on rounding a little hill I came upon a
prospector's camp. The sight was not
an unusual one for me, as I ran across
these gold-seekers in all parts of thf
desert. My horse seeing the camp in
stinctively headed for it. Wrapped up
in a piece of canvas tenting, alone on
the ground, lay an old gray-haired
man. As I approached he stuck his
head out from the covering. The cold
wind blowing drove back from his
sharply featured face a mass of long,
wavy hair..
"You haven't got a little whisky
about you. have ytou?" he querieu. -In
an&rt'er to his question I drew from^rhy
pocket a flask of the desired llqu'd and
handed it t(Thlm. S-< .

around by the old turquoise mine near
Crows Springs before the snow came
on I'd fetch her one of the blue s' >nes
for a Christmas present. Poor little
girl; she won't get much else this year.
I've been sinking my assessment holes
on a group a few miles east o' h r "e,
and was on my way to the old mine
when this danged rheumatism caught
me."
I saw that the oM- fellow was pretty
weak. He couldn't eat anything and
could hardly move without paining
himself a great deal. I wanted him to
come on to camp with me, but he pro- 1
tested that he woul'd be all right. -
"Why," he said, "I've traveled this
stretch of sand and sagebrush for over
forty years. I love the life, and am as
safe here* as I'd "be in a horspital.
Soon's I get the girl a stone I'll come in

But the old desert hermit didn't beat
the snows. The next day the flakes be

PROMINENT ENGINEER WHO
WRITES OF CONDITIONS
IN PANAMA.
From the Mayor's report it appears that some of the sup
plies he has investigated are conveyed through wooden
pipes. It is doubtful whether such a method is safe or tol
erable, though the cost is much cheapened by it. The^cost
of water to the rate payer in the case of these public sup
plies does not convey as clear an idea as it would if the plant
were compelled to bear' its whole cost by basing the bonds
on it alone. Granting that any city makes a profit on a
putriic supply or that it keeps even, the argument for making
the plant carry its own bonds is strengthened.
It is not the part of wisdom to mortgage the credit 6f a
growing city for the purchase of public utilities. The needs
of such a city in its schools, parks, streets, sewers and public
improvements, which may properly depend upon its credit,
should cause everywhere the demand that public utilities
carry themselves and be supported by income derived from
those who use them. This policy has been twice indorsed
in San Francisco by the refusal of the taxpayers to make a
street railroad system a burden on the taxable property of
the city. Cleveland, Ohio, lias just voted down decisively a
proposition to mortgage the public credit to create a'munici
pal plant to supply electrical power and light. Of course in
the etfent of failure of a public plant to pay interest on its
bonds a city can at any time impose its credit between the
plant and loss. But correct business principles require that
the business shall carry itself.
Another element seems to us to dominate the whole issue
of public ownership. The experiment .of mixing business
ruid -political government in every considerable city in this
country has restated in loss.. due to inexpert and oftentimes
corrupt administration, which is not easily detected nor
known at all until the loss hii occurred. .Every clear
headed advocate of municipal ownership agrees with us that
that policy is to be finally vindicated as superior to private
ownership by making every plant carry its own credit.
In the trail of all experiments involving the public credit
and mortgn^ing the taxpayers rise regrets that the city did
not start right. Recently a decided reaction against public
ownership has been apparent in the East. Toledo and other
cities have been left with a public debt on their hands and
with no plant nor property to represent it. It is likely that
the "example of Cleveland will be generally followed until
the advocates of public ownership everywhere consent ,to
makrt every plant carry itself and depend upon the income de
rived from the rate payers. This is a matter in which it is
easy to* make a mistake, but difficult to remedy it.
It is seen clearly now that Oakland made a mistake by se
curing a second water company, as all business foresights
clearly indicated that the result would be combinationtn re
place competition and the city,,, would have to carry an unne
cessary increment of capital. If the existing plant is left in
the field after a public plant is acquired the difficulty is in
creased instead of being removed. At present a very large
part e Jf the population of Oakland is independent of the ex
istinfc water supply, finding what it wants in the abundant
artesian supply that underlies the city. Those taxpayers will
continue to be independent of the public supply whg.a it is
introduced, but their property will be mortgaged to create
it if <he bonds be made. a lien on the city instead of on the
plant. When the question is considered, as a business propo
sition should be, without prejudice, it will be found that, there
is not a single valid argument against making the credit of
a public plaHt carry its cost and putting its support upon the
rate payers who desire to use it. g, Â©
We regard this as of such importance to the future wel
fare of these cities ,that it is worth while even to wait until
any legal impediments are removed if such be in the way. It
is easy to see that if enthusiasm and prejudice are permitted
to raise the floodgates of inconsiderate public ownership now
instead of relieving us of any ills we have the policy of mort
gaging the taxpayer will bring greater. Oakland enjoys the
opportunity of setting the pace which other cities will follow
when its superior utility is demonstrated and should not be
content to imitate experiments of doubtful utility and take a
path that is strewn with failures and vain regrets.
THE Mayor of Oakland is studying the .question of
water supply with great energy in response to the sen
timent of his city in the direction of getting more in
dependent conditions. He reports on the supply under pub
lic ownership in Portland and Seattle. It must be remem
bered, however, that the physical conditions in the moist
north are widely different from ours. Much error has been
propagated by treating the Glasgow supply as analogous in
all things to a supply in California. The Glasgow water
shed has an annual rainfall of fifty inches 'and iris not con
fined to one season as here, out is distributed through the
thirteen, and by the rules of maleficent
influences untold disasters should have
overtaken uf. But nothing in the way
of an accident occurred, and this im
tnualty too in spite of the predictions
pf our French fellow voyageurs, who
fell out of line before we had half fin
ished, advisinp us that we were sure
to die of (?haÂ«;ruB fever in a few days
at the farthest.
Our party left New York just before
the holidays in 1897, and consisted of
a number of world famous contractors,
some of whom had done extensive work
on the Chicago drainage channel. There
were some promoters and others, and
myself as engineer. The design of the
expedition was to investigate the Pan
ama and also the Nicaragua canal
routes in order to determine as to their
ie!ative feasibility, economy and con
venience for- commerce and to secure
construction work. The result of our
investigation led up to the contention
as to the two routes â Nicaragua and
Panamaâ which I believe was not wise
ly decided In favor of the latter. At
least our advocacy of the Nicaragua
route and the offer of our contractors
to build a ship canal at that crossing
forced the French company to terms.
On our voyage outward from New
Tork we were overtaken Just below
Cape Hatteras by the ever memorable
blizzard that froze the orange trees in
Florida and made a new record of tem
peratures south of Mason and Dlxon's
line. I mention this storm because in
spite of the fact that we were almost
wrecked, by it it was probably the
agency which made It possible to com
plete our walk through the Culebra cut
without Incurring the fever.
The steamers that ply the tropic seas
are not constructed like the transat
lantic liners. Our vessel's staterooms
opened on the deck and not in a saloon.
The result was that when the storm
came on our beds and clothing were
saturatr-d and our shoes washed over
board. Our cargo was shifted by the
rolling of the vessel and we got into
the Dahamas with our chip listed to
one Fide Vke a racing yacht in a high
v.ind.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Arriving at Colon (which name is
Spanish for Columbus), on the Atlantic
tide of the isthmus, we crossed to the
Pacific side by rail and put up at the
Hotel Grand, where they serve most
excellent two-hour seven-course din
ners. This is accomplished by serving
one dish as a course, and while you are
eating it preparing the dish that is to
follow it. Incidentally it may be re
jnarked that the diner should be well
advised as to how long it requires to
cook the several courses, so that he
may not eat so rapidly that he will
freate an uncomfortable hiatus between
(r urses. The Hotel Grand's walls were
then cracked from bottom to top by
earthquakes, aqd some of them have
Kince been thrown down. Inside the
hotels of the tropics the rooms open on
an interior court, orpatio, with balco
nies for each floor, the, doors and parti
tions often being made only of Jalousies
â or what we call shuttersâ having
fixed slats. Xo provision is made to ex
clude mosquitoes from the rooms. The
beds have, "mosquetaires," made of
close-meshed tarletonâ the mosquitoes
being emailâ wiiich canopy the beds.
A few days since the local yellow sheet what
purported to be the full text of the canal treaty between the
United States and Panama. The report was dishonest in
every particular and the imposition upon the public was ex
posed. The onty element of interest in connection with this
mendacity is that the saffron kid has since been forced to
print several other lies to support the first, and to the public
this procedure is no novelty. ' ,
IT IS TIME TO DISARM.
Recurring to the fever, I will say that
there is no overestimating its deadly
character. While I have not made a
scientific study of the subject of tropic
fevers, I am advised that the general
characteristics of the fevers are the
same throughout the West Indies and
the Panama country. In other words,
the same fever exists in different N de
grees. with alight variation, at the sev
eral portions of the American ' tropics.
The banks of the cut, on which the
sun shone down from the peculiarly
white sky of the low tropics, reflected
and confined the heat. At times we
rested, but the slight shade we found
was not of the sort to encourage long
pauses. By noon we were saturated
with perspiration and our flannel cloth
ing was wringing wet. Owing to the
burden of moisture in the atmosphere
there was no evaporation and our
clothes were as if dipped In water. This
produces an exceedingly uncomfortable,
suffocating sensation. %
After five miles of the cut had been
traveled General Royer and his
French subordinates boarded the train,
urging us to do so also. They remained
on it, keeping pace with us. The Amer
icans kept moving steadily forward.
At points where the French officials on
the train could communicate with us
they would urge us to come aboard.
But we were unwilling to give up. I
cannot say but that- there was an ele
ment of Anglo-Saxon pride and stub
bornness in the determination with
which we held to the fiery path in
Culebra cut. Hours passed and we
plodded on. Our FrerTbh consorts in
the train waited and we walked,
walked, walked. It grew hotter and
hotter. At first we had talked with a
good deal of hilarity, but there was
less talk now, and finally none. We
watched each other and cautioned
against too great exertion. Some went
to the train. The rest moved steadily
forward over the hot red earth.
We were all much exhausted when
we reached Obispo at the end of the
cut, where we boarded the .train and
were hauled quickly back to' Panama.
I think our walk and our escape from
fever were commented on by the na
tives and the French canal builders
more than any other event in our visit
to the Panama, canal.
â¢ â¢ â¢
But we learned afterward that there
was a dark background to the general's
apprehension. Not long before only
three men. the remnant of a corps of
fifty engineers, superintendents and
c'.erks, had been sent back to Frani*.
In the cut* we were between. walls of
earth hundreds of feet high in places,
with the tropical, almost meridian, sun
beating down upon us. Our pathway
was not particularly bad for footmen,
but was* up and down at times and
sometimes devious. The temperature
was somewhere in the 90s, but the tem
perature as Indicated by the thermom
eter cannot be determined in its effects
on men and animals unless the humid
ity be considered. Thus "ninety de
grees moist" is a severe heat even in
the tropics and is enervating in the
extreme. On the contrary, ninety de
grees in the dry altitudes of Arizona
and New Mexico is braclng'and not un
pleasant.
We Americans laughed
General Royer. who had charge of the
construction work, said as we were
leaving Panama:
"Nothing but my desire to enable you
gentlemen to see the cut at all points
would prompt me to so with you. I
cannot refrain from discouraging you
even now. The undertaking is hazard
ous in the extreme."
At the outset of our tramp the French
canal construction officials were not en
thusiastic. They wanted us to see the
work, but they evinced a wholesome
dread of the fever.
Finally we began our journey in this
cut, which in itself is not remarkable,
except for its magnitude â or, rather,
contemplated magnitude. We found a
trench ICO feet deep cut 300 feet wide
Into a dark reddish clay formed from
degenerated volcanic matter. This ma
terial is not exceptionally hard to
handle, and but for the vast amount
which has to be moved, lifted and
# haul?d to spoil banks hundreds of feet
away and hundreds of feet high, its re
moval would rot be formidable. The
bottom of the Culebra cut was then and
is yet 160 feet above sea level. At some
points the work was being done in ter
races or benches running parallel with
the line of the canal. On each of these
levels was a railway with tram cars.
These cars were filled by dredging ma
chinery, then run to low places and
dumped. The cars themselves were
Iron dums cars and were of ordinary
design. The devices for moving- the
earth employed by the Panama Canal
Company are much inferior to those
that were,used on the Chicago drainage
channel.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The Culebra canal cut practically
parallels the transisthmian railroad, so
that a train was sent along with us to
pick up any prostrated by the heat or
from other cause.
"Mucho malo," commented the man
as if to himself who took care of some
of my belongings when we were about
to leave the hotel.
"What's that?" I asked.
"La Culebra es mucho malo (very
bad)." he explained, shaking his head
deprecatlngly.
"Muy ralor â enflrmar"â very hot and
sicklyâ he insisted, laying his head over
to one side and gasping as if overcome.
He did not want to lose me, for had I
not tipped him handsomely? The na
tives have a torror of the fever, and It
is erroneous to suppose that the negro
is Immune. At Panama I learned that
several ship loads of negroes from
Sierra Leone was brought to work on
the canal, but that they died so fast
from Chagres feverâ Just as white men
doâ that the British Government Inter
posed to save the remnant that sur
vived and had them sent back to Af
rica. â¢ .0
Starting from Panama one morning
In January. 1898. we made preparations
for our walk through the Culebra cut.
There is at least one extraordinary ad
vantage in starting out on a tramp In
the tropicsâone doesn't have to carry
any wraps. Therefore we had no lug
gage.
These mosquetalres intensify the heat.
California has suffered from her reputation as a gun fight
ing State. Several years ago when the National Teachers'
Association met here it was found that many visiting teach
ers had prepared themselves for the journey by buying re
volvers. One unfortunate high school teacher on his way to
the Yosemite while sleeping on his arms was killed by his
own pistol. We who live here know that there is no need
to carry arms in California any more than there is to wear
guns in Grace Church, New York, or in meetings of the
Women's Christian Temperance Union. But unfortunately
there are exceptions among 'us and these are wrongly used
to establish an undesirable reputation for the State.
Even in our pioneer days the carrying of pistols was not a
habit. Yet every, time art deals with the early California
miner, either in painting or sculpture, he is made to wear a
beard like a horse tail and have two pistols in holsters on his
hips and gird with a cartridge belt. It is a misrepresentationt
The pistol habit is a vice that should be discouraged by
severe punishment. It has 'caused a homicide in the Palace
Hotel that brings sorrow to many and! inflicts injury upon
the State. If the slayer in this case had been without a pistol
no casualty could have occurred. But he ; was "in the habit"
of carrying a pistol, arid so what' would : have been only a
scuffle was turned into a' tragedy.

THE Democratic press of the country has ceased to
hunt for a Democratic candidate for the Presidency,
and is employing its leisure in finding a Republican
candidate. With great unanimity it has selected Senator
Hanna as Republican standard bearer. There may be in
this an element of gratitude. The Democracy may well
warm up to' the Ohio Senator for the great favor he did it
in besoming Tom Johnson from the political fa^ce of the
earth. -t â¢
Johnson made the issue personal to himself and Senator
Hanna. It was a square and definite test o'f their leader
ship and popularity, and of the principles they represent.
The result was a victory for' Hanna by the largest majority
ever given by Omo in a State election. Johnson has not
Wen heard of since. His breath was so completely knocked
out that he did not have enough left for an interview ex
planatory of how it happened. It was not one of those
close finishes, after which, the. loser could sit ' down and
figure that a^changp of a fraction'* of a vote in each precinct
would have changed the result. Quite otherwise, it was
a solid impact of adverse votes, that came in tens of thou
sands, until the majority far outran, the hundred thousand
mark.
- It is of interest to see the profound respect now felt for
Senator Hanna by the Democracy. That party's press
sees in him the logical Republican candidate and is practi
cally unanimous for him. This is very kind and is no
doubt appreciated by Mr. Hanna. It is such a change
from the mud-slinging which has assailed him ever since
iSq6. Even the Hearst papers have ceased to cartoon him
frescoed with dollar marjes, and in*the exceeding peace that
has overcome the spirit of scandal it would seem as if he
were assured of the support of the Democracy, and that
another golden age of American politics were standing in
the wings, ready for jtsTcue to appear in the glare of the
footlights.
But these gentlemen who appear as next friend of the
Republican party omit a few factors from their calculation.
The Ohio Republican convention unanimously indorsed
President Roosevelt for the nomination. It is no justifiable
criticism. to say that Senator Hinjna was not friendly to
that indorsement, when *t was proposed by his colleague.
Foraker. But when his acute political sense saw clearly
that a'; being proposed, to turn it down would be construed
into a rebuke of the President, he made it .'uianimous. So
the Ohio election did three things. It sent Tom Johnson
into obscurity, gave Hanna the greatest personal indorse
ment ever enjoyed by an American leader in his own State,
and committed Ohio to President Roosevelt.
It is tne habit of the opposition press to see grave con
flicts between Hanna and the President. Every few days
they carpet the ground with their ears and hear the sound
of quarreling between the President and the Senator. Now
the fact is that they do have differences. To entertain dif
ferences of opinion on matters of policy is no new thing
with them. Senator Hanna does not hesitate to take his
stand and abide by it, to a finish. But this has caused no
alienation between him and the President.
Those who understand President Roosevelt long ago
knew that he does not want disciples. He enjoys fair and
frank opposition in his own party, and in the issues that
have arisen between him and its leaders he cheerfully sub
mits the matter to Congress and abides by the result, as do
they. . We have an illustration of this in the controversy
that has arisen over the confirmation of General Wood.
The general is the President's friend, and he stands by his
friends. But Major Rathbone, who claims that he was
misused by Wood in Cuba, is Hanna's friend, and the Sen
ator stuck to him in adversity and now pushes his vindi
cation by seeking the defeat of Wood. In this Hanna is
joined by Teller, one of the Senate leaders of the minority.
It is a fair fight, open and above board, and when it is
over everybody will have had a day in court, American
fashion, and there will be no resentment left after it is
finished.
We will admit that this is something new in American
politics, for in the past such independence has too often
degenerated into personal hatred. It was so between Cal
houn and Jackson, and between Buchanan and Douglas.
In those controversies it was the habit to permit no dif
ferences, and to treat personal independence as party
treason. But that practice is past, and the country sees the
President and the chairman of the national committee dif
fering, fighting it out in all vigor and fairness, and their
personal relations remaining unstrained. So the Demo
cracy may as well withdraw the nomination of Mr. Hanna,
and conclude that it must meet President Roosevelt next
year, the leader of a united party and backed by no one
stronger than by Mr. Hanna.

College Manners.
The kind president of Randolph-Ma-^

not use his beat endeavors to discover

in this affairâ he would be quite within
his rights by expelling themâ he will

since to serve an imprisonment of ten years for planning a
railroad wreck in which several lives were lost and much
property was destroyed. This verdict presents two distress

is guilty and horrifying if she is innocent. She should have
been hanged or set free. The next railroad wreck in Vir

In testimony wJtiereof this story:
Bluff and gruff old "limejuicer" that
he was, a strong, sturdy, character was
the veteran Captain Bryan, for many
years port captain , ogthe Occidentr.l
and Oriental Steamshfp Company. He
was known the length and breadth of
thr~water front as a typical British sea
dog. For forty years he had sailed the
oceans and when he abandoned the
winds and waves it was \ to take a post
ashore that shoul<L^keep him in close
touch with his former duties on, the
poop.
As nort captain the veteran skipper
had the important duty, among many
others, of superintending the discharge
of the "O. and O." China and Japan
liners. One of these, the Gaelic, was
being emptied of her valuable cargo of
silks, rice, fa and other Oriental wares
one night at the Mail Dock. Captain
Bryan was busy as a-beaver directing
the job. They were working at the
mqnent on silk, transferring the valu
able stuff to freight cars for a hurry
trip across the continent. A bale hi
silk Is a bale of silk, and Captain Bryan
knew well its value.
In the midst 0/ the bustle there was a
splash alongside the dock. The excited
rush of men to the pier's edge v and a
cry for ropes attracted Bryan. The
"old man" ambled over to the scene
with a:
"What's dolns here?"
"Man overboard," was the response
from a dozen throfts.
"Huh," grunted Bryan quickly turn

stevedores to get at work, "I thought
it was a bale of silk."
have not heard that he was disarmed. No one in this State
can carry concealed weapons without a permit.. That is the
law. Under ij if a man can prove to the proper public au
thority that he is reasonably apprehensive of personal danger
he can get a permit to carry arms. Those who go' armed
without such permit are guilty of a misdemeanor and should
be punished: .When a man threatens another with violence
he should be reported to the police, arrested ind searched
for weapons, to be disarmed if he have them and then fined
or put in jail for carrying them. No man has a right to
carry arms to protect himself against the consequences of his
own truculence or habitual -bullying of others.
It is time for California to purge her reputation in this
respect, and this last instance of wanton slaughter should
serve as the inducement of a crusade that will part the fool
and his gun.

Junior day was brought to a fitting
close last evening with a "prom" at'
Berkeley at which the crush was ter
rific. The hall was elaborately â¢ deco
rated with holly, palms and electric ef
fects. The affair was in charge of these
committees:
Emil Kruschke's three-act farce, "A
Pair of Papas." was also brimful of ef
fective situations and catchy lines. It
was the story of a collegian In love who
transformed his parental roof into a
summer boarding-house, with a Hi
bernian tramp as landlord. In order to
make opportunity to meet the object of
his adoration. The piece fairly reeked
of clean-cut fun. which all the charac
ters had a fairly divided chance to de
velop.
COMPLIMENTS FOB, ALL.
The dialogue, too, was bright, and th*
students in the cast made the very
most of their excellent opportunities
for individual and collective hit-scor
ing. It was a unique conception cf the
ludicrous that had a stuttering lover
intrust to a phonograph equipped with
a specially prepared record the proposal
of marriage which he was afraid his
defective Dower of speech might mar
in delivery. And it was in harmony
with the farcical idea that the proposal
should be addressed to. a lady for whom
It was not Intended and that its In
tended recipient should be regaled with
a selection arranged for the entertain
ment of barroom habitues. The people
in the cast were Trow W. Hendrlck,
Mark R. Daniels, Oliver S. Orrick, Gar
field J. Anloff, Mary Durand and Alice
M. Phillips.
William C. Crittenden, the class presi
dent, ooened the proceedings with a
neat address, in which he pointed to the
significance of junior day and reviewed
the achievements of the class In ath
letic and intellectual endeavor. Then
came the curtain-raiser, a one-act farce
entitled "A Record Proposal," which
was written by Mark Roy Daniels and
reflected a genuine ingenuity of plot
and situationâ those essentials to suc
cessful play writing.
DIALOGUE IS GREAT.

into the big Central Theater yesterday
afternoon enjoyed the "opening of the
annual junior day celebration by means
of which the Junior class of 1905, Uni
versity of California, celebrated its ad
mittance to upper classdom. The en
tertainment consisted of two original,
dramatic productions written and acted
by students, and the applause that
greeted the players and rewarded their
efforts throughout the performance was
spontaneous and unstinted. The fac
ulty and their wc-men folk occupied thÂ£
boxes, and every seat in p^rquette and
gallery had an occupant, while the side
aisles and lobby were packed with per
sons who evidently relished their privi
lege of filling up the "standing room
onlv."
Inez E. Ray Harrison filed a suit for
a divorce yesterday against Mahlcm C.
Harrison of the Insurance brokerage
firm of Ji. C. Harrison & Co. She
charges him with extreme cruelty and
in a complaint containing more than
twenty closely written . typewritten
pages makes many allegations in sup
port of her claim that for the last three
years she has been a much abused and
shamefully treated wife. They were
married at Rays Landing, Oregon, May
3, 1S98. and have been residing at 2751
Broadway. .
Harrison's alleged fondness for other
women than his wife is the averred
cause of the rift in their matrimonial
happiness. His wife says that both in
public and in private her husband has
lavished his affections upon other
women, greatly to her humiliation and
sorrow and has frequently threatened
to harm her and has struck her because
she protested. She says that in every
hotel at which they stopped in Port
land, Ore., in this city and in New York
he caused her great grief because of his
actions with various women. Cooks,
waitresses, nurses and typewriters, all
under 20, says Mrs. Harrison, were the
objects of his love. She says further
that at their home in this city he mis
conducted himself, bringing thereto all
sorts of disreputable characters of both
sexes. She says he thought nothing of
kissing and caressing these women in
her presence and made no objections
and did not offer to defend her when
they made proposals that she should
not have been compelled to hear.

sailant. Cochen is posing as the in
jured husband. He says he has good
cause for being grieved, and showed
the following extract from a letter sent
by Crape to his wife:
'I, Arthur Edward Crape, do declare
that I love you as much as -you love
me. and if you will be my pretty wife
I will do what is right. Amen."
Judge Cabaniss ordered that Burness
put up a bond of $500 to keep the peace.
He must remain in Jail until he can
raise the money.
Emil Rurness intends inserting an
advertisement in the daily papers for
some one to put up $500 to get him out
of jail. He languishes in the City
Prison, and will remain in durance vile
until he can gather the necessary
shekels to secure his liberation.
Emil has been thrusting his atten
tions on a married woman, and the
lady objects. She has had him arrested
on a charge of threats to kill, and her
statement to the court, which is cor
roborated by other witnesses, proves
Burners to be a dangerous man. He
has drawn a gun and threatened to
kill unless*. Mrs. Clara Sterling of 20
Frpelon street will be his wife. Mrs.
Sterling is satisfied with her better
half ar.d declines to leave him for Bur
ness.
The court dismissed the charge and
the innocent men left 'the courtroom,
sympathizing with each other. .
"Â¦Carroll was yelling loudly for help,"
said Peterson, ".and my friend and my
self rushed out of the house to help
him. Xo sooner had we appeared than
a policeman came on us and Carroll
accused us of robbing him. "We tried
to explain, but the 'cop' took us to
Jail."
Never again will C. A. Peterson and
E. A. "Watson play the part of good
Samaritans. According to the state
ments they made In court yesterday
they will mind their ov.-n business in
future. Both men were charged with
robbery and the alleged victim was C.
Carroll, a laboring man.
The soldiers three failed to material
ize in court, so Judge Mogan issued
bench warrants. The spectators are
curious to gaze on the defenders of the
flag. Even money was wagered they
were fit subjects for the hospital.
Corporal Daniel Sylvester and Police
man Barry appeared in Judge Mogan's
court yesterday with their hands
swathed in bandages. Barry complained
of dislocated knuckles and Sylvester of
a bad wrist. The injuries were received
while battling with Guy Newman,
Joseph Jones and Alfred Posntr. mem

BABY COFFEE TOPERS
Were Given Coffee at 2 Years of Age.
"My mother always gave her children
coffee to drink from the time they were
eld enough to hold a cup, consequently
I used It from the time I was 2 years
old to my eighteenth year," says a
young lady of Potomac, III.
â¢'Although I never suspected it, cof-
fee was all this time undermining my
health, and suddenly, without any
Â¦warning. I was taken with nervous
prostration. At times I could scarcely
breathe and my face twitched continu-
fiJiy.
? "I was almost helpless and my stom-
ach was out of order all the time. For
three years I was treated, with only
temporary relief, having to stay in bed
nearly all the time. Then my uncle, an
old physician, came to visit us. and as
soon as he had studied my case a little
bit he said:
" "Let me get you a square meal. I
think I can make better coffee than
any one in this house.'
"So I waited patiently, for I did love
pood coffee, and I thought I had never
ta=t*>d Fuch delicious coffee as that was,
and I wondered why others could not
make it Just the same. So uncle told
me he wotrfd tea-h them just how it
was made.
"In this way I drank Postum Coffee
for nearjy a month before I knew it. I
found my stomach getting so much
better and all my troubles disappear-
ing, and in a few weeks I was up and
around the house again and stronger
and better than I had been for a long
time. I am still growing stronger every
day, and I am doing my best to get my
friends to do away with coffee and use
Postum in its place.
"Coffee almost ruined me and I know
it. and I know the only way that I got
rid of it and got well was by drinking
Postum in its place. I have found out
4 that you must be careful to follow di-
l rections on the Postum package to
make good Postum." Name given by
Postum Co- Battle Creek, Mich.

the famous little book, "The Road to

Water Front Notes.
The new ocean-going towboat Daunt
less, built by the Risdon Iron Works
for the John D. Spreckels & Bros.' Tug
Company, was given her trial in the bay
yesterday afternoon and in all respects
gave satisfaction. She made more than
thirteen knots and her engines developed
SOO horsepower. She was given a thor
ough test at sea and proved herself
what her owners intended her to be,
the -"most powerful and best equipped
towboat on the Pacific.
The. Dauntless was launched on the
evening of May 5 and as she slid Into
the water -was given her name and a
baptism oi wine by Miss Adelaide M.
Samuels. The new boat is 12S feet
long, 24.6 feet In beam and has a
draught of 15 -/eel She is fitted with
the most approved system of oil burn
ers and has tank capacity for enough
fuel for thirty jdays* steaming. She
carries a which generates the
electricity for her elaborate system of
lighting. Fast and powerful, she will
form a valuable addition to the
Spreckels fleet, which is now the larg
est and best equipped on the Pacific
Ocean. For ocean towing the Daunt
less will have no equal and she will
find ground the harbor plerrf.y ofj)use
for her great strength.
Her commander is Captain John J.
rhea, one of the best-known mariners
on the coast. As a navigator ana pilot
Captain has few equals. He was
for many years in the service of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company, in
whose esteem he stands high.

SALIXAS. Nov. 27.â During the trial
this afternoon of Charles W. Graves,
charged with having looted cars of the
Southern Pacific Company near here on
August 14 last year, an unexpected sur
prise was sprung. After some dozen
witnesses had beep examined by the
prosecution District Attorney Treat
called William H. Daugherty, sen
tenced to one year at San Quentin for
receiving Btolen goods in connection
with the Graves case. Daugherty had,
after conviction and on his way to San
Quentin. voluntarily offered to testify
iigrainst hie confederates. When placed
on the stand to-day and asked as to
his acquaintance with Graves, the ac
cused man, and the robbery, Daugherty
straightened up and replied in defiant
manner:
"I positively refuse to give any tes
timony in this case. I won't answer
any questions."
He was finally ordered from the
Ftand. At the conclusion of the day's
trial Daugherty was served with an
other warrant charging him with hav
ing knowingly received twenty sacks of
stolen barley. After the prelinimary
hsaring he will be returned to San
Quentin. where he will remain until
the time set for his trial. Several other
charges will be presented against him
as a result of his refusal to aid the
prosecution in the Graves case.
Throughout the trial and until a few
days before his execution Frith acted
with remarkable nonchalance, but
toward the end he felt his position
keenly.
VICTORIA, B. C. Nov. 27.â Alfred J.
Frith, "who murdered Frederick J.
Bailey, naval storekeeper, at Esqui
malt, was Ranged to-day. He met
death with the same nerve which has
characterized hi3 attitude since the
murder.
Cool and without bravado, he walked
erectly up the stairs unassisted to the
scaffold, stepped on the trap, stretched
his neck out and waited for the noose.
Frith died instantly, his neck being
broken by the fall.
Frith ' murdered Frederick James
Bailey, first-class naval storekeeper, at
the royal navy yard at Esquimalt on
June 27 last. Frith had been discharged
from the naval yard, where he had
been employed as a subordinate of
Bailey, and told friends that he be
lieved Bailey had been undermining
him. Frith was preparing to remove
.with his family to Vancouver and had
asked Bailey for some packing cases.
They had gone to the- storehouse in
the navy yard to get these, and, after
putting some outside the door at one
end â a door which locked on the in
side â were proceeding toward the other
door through an alley of stacked up
ropes, stores, etc., Bailey in the lead,
when Frith drew a revolver and shot
Bailey from behind, the bullet entering
at the base of the skull. Frith locked
the door, threw the key away and
walked down to the naval wharf, where
he threw the revolver into the harbor.
Then the murderer walked out of the
yard, and meeting a police constable
he knew, confesed the murder to him.
*Frith claimed that Bailey had rushed
at him with a club after some talk
the alleged undermining and he
had shot him in self-defense. ex
amination of the building, though,
failed to reveal anything that could be
used as a club, and the appearances all
went to show that Bailey had been
murdered. ..'; .Â¦/â¢; .'v!

Two cars of Cape Cod Cranberries are In.

Business In the fruit market was suspended
at an early hour yesterday out of respect to
the memory of the late D. E. Allison, who was
one of the oldest and some years ago tha most
prominent produce dealer In that part of the
city. The market was amply supplied and
quiet daring the greater part of the day. and.
although there was a little extra Inquiry for
shipment on the Puget Sound steamer, prices
were no hisher. - Apples continued abundant
and *>'ere rather quiet and oth?r tree fruits
were easy. Dry lots of choice Grapes suitably
packed for shipping met with ready sale at
good figures, wh'le undesirable lots, which con
stitute the bulk of the receipts, sold slowly
at unsteady rates. Poor and carried-over stock
was offering freely at 354? 40c per crate, but
found few buyers. Raspberries and Strawber
ries still showed the effects of the recent wet
weather and were hard to dispose of. Some
Raspberries were offered below the quotations,
going as low as $2 per chest.
New crop Navel Oranges, Seedlings and Tan
gerines continued to arrive freely and prices
were easier, particularly on the lower grades of
Navels and Seedlings. The recent arrivals of
Mexican Limes we9kened the market and
prices were Â¦ quoted lower. Valencia Oranges
are practically out of the market and the quo
tations are withdrawn.
STRAWBERRIESâ Longworths. $3#10 per
chest: lanre berries. $2fj * per chest.
$5^8 per chest.
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Butter and Eggs stand exactly the. same as
quoted last week, but stocks of both are stead
ily decreasing and lower prices are expected
In the near future. Cheese and Honey continue
plentiful and unchanged.
Meats and Fish and most kinds of Poultry
and Game are still selling at the prices quoted
last week.. Turkeys are scare and higher, the
demand for Thanksgiving having reduced sup
piles to far below the normal.
Fruits Â¦ and Vegetables are , as plentiful as
could be expected at this time of the year and
prices have varied but little since last week.

The Plasterers' Union may soon de

noon the employers decided to force the
issue, and accordingly notified the men
that their demand would not be
granted.
In the event of such a strike the
plumbers and inside finishers will also
be thrown out of employment, for it
will be impossible for them to work if
the plasterers go out. The reason the
employers refuse to grant the Increase
is because they allege that many of the

says iris worth 3,000 times its weight in

thing I noticed Is that the
Â»trange substance can be seen better at
night than in the day time. I believe
that Is because the eye is full of light
in the day ..time and therefore not so
acute when it su'ddenly becomes dark.
In the night, however, the eyes have

The radium Dr. Booth used in these
experiments was imported . from Ger
many, though a great deali of it is pur
chased In. France.- It is Enclosed in a
little glass tube that is sealed af both
ends. It is really a white powder,. but
gives the vessel containing it a violet
tint, this tint being permanent unless
the glass is heated red hot. This col
oring of the'glass.is an instance of the
importance of radium to the arts. v as It
may be used to modify 'the cojors of
glass and -crystals, > and possibly, of
gems. It has already been established
that radium is an agent for distinguish
ing real from imitation diamonds, since
it causes the real stones to sparkle
brightly/when brought near, them in a
darkened room and has hardly any* ef
fect whatever on the false stones. - -
