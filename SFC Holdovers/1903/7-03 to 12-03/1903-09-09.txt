The Chinese were turned over to the

they reached Montreal they were stopped
by writs of habeas corpus made return
able in the Canadian court at that place
on Thursday of this week. This action
was instituted by persons In the "United
States interested in bringing the Chinese
into this country. It is contended that
the agreement entered into by the rail
road company is Uiegal. If the Chinese
are admitted on evidence of naturaliza
tion, which the officials, believe will' be
manufactured, Sargent will recommend
that every port alongthe Canadian bor

Recently seventeen Chinese were denied
admission at Malone, N. Y., and Rich

undertook to transport in bond all Chi

SOFIA, Bulgaria. Sept 8.â All reports
from the vilayet of Monastir agres
in describing the situation as ap
palling. Between 30,000 and 30.000 Bulga
rian inhabitants are believed to have
been massacred by the Turks and every
Bulgarian village in the vilayet ha3 been
destroyed. The refugees in the mountains
and forests are dying of starvation by
thousands.
At present it Is impossible to obtain
precise figures. The revolutionary head
quarters estimate that 30,000 Bulgarian
men, women and children have been
killed, while at least the same number of
refugees are slowly perishing: of hunger.
In official circles these figures are regard
ed as an underestimate and officials in
cline to the belief that the number of
the massacred exceeds 50.0CO. The Turk3
are apparently determined to extermlnata
the entire Bulgarian population of thÂ©
vilayet. The actual details of the hap
penings outside the towns are not avail
able. The foreign representatives at
Monastir are dependent on information
supplied to them from Turkish official
sources.
BULGARIA EXPECTS ATTACK.
In Government circles here the situa
tion is viewed with increasing alarm. It
is reliably reported that the Turkish
forces in Macedonia number 33,000. It is
considered Impossible that such a forco
could have assembled merely to crush
the rebellion. It is feared that the Sultaa
is meditating an attack on Bulgaria.
According to a telegram from Constan
tinople, the Porte has issued an uncondi
tional order that all European corre
spondents must leave Macedonia, because
they are circulating false news. The Em
bassadors have been notified of this de
cision.
The latest report regarding Boris Sara
foff, the Macedonian leader, say3 he was
wounded In the leg near Dairene.
The Macedonian Interior organization
estimates that 150,000 women, children
and old men are hiding In the mountains
and forest3 of Macedonia. The Turks are
burning the forests in the districts of
Leron and Kosbro and killing fugitives
who attempt to escape to the plains.
CAST CAPTIVES INTO FIRE.
The Vlach village of Gopesh. three
hours* distant from Monastir. has been
burned by the Turks, who are reported
to have thrown several of the Inhabitants
into the fire. The Bashl-Bazouks have
destroyed the village of Stoilovo.
Thirteen thousand Turkish soldiers are
assembled on the frontier near Pa'.anka,
Kratovo and Gobshanl and are plunder
ing the surrounding villages. The peopla
have not complained, fearing that they
will be murdered. In the district of De

SALONICA, Sept. 8.â
Twelve battalions of
Turkish troops are re
ported to have surrounded
a large revolutionary band
near Ostrove, thirty miles
from Monastir. Fighting
is proceeding. The revo
lutionaries have taken up
a position near Lake Ania
tove in the vilayet of
Constantinople. Turkish
troops are now said to be
attacking them.
"It will thus be seen that in deference
tc the objections of the other powers the
snore objectional features of the demands
tnade by M. Planchon (who was recently
Russian Charge d'Affaires in Peking)
have been omitted, and while Russia sur
renders no material advantage she has
grained time and can rest content that
China will never act in any way coun
ter to M. Planchon's demands. She also
Eaves the face of China, which will ac
cept the altered conditions with alacrity.
Russia further hopes thereby to pacify
Japan's resentment by apparently acced
ing to her wishes while retaining abso
lute military control of the country and
hoping now to be able to push to com
pletion undisturbed her military prepara
tions."

MAGELSSEN A BRAVE MAN.
Details of Attacks Upon the Ameri
can Vice Consul.
BERLIN, Sept. 8.â The Egyptian Ga
zette, published In Alexandria, Egypt,
has published details regarding the re
cent attack upon United States Vice Con
sul Magelssen.' It says Magelssen was
riding home In a hired carriage In the
evening when, on passing a street near
the Bas Beirut (a headland about three
miles below Beirut, on which stand the
buildings of the American mission), he
heard sounds of pistol firing. He turned
about to see whence the shots came and
a bullet whizzed past his face.
The Vice Consul at once had the car
riage stopped and jumrjed out to discover
hl3 assailant, but could see no one. The
following day he went to the Govern
ment office, where he met the Italian
Consul and the Austrian Consul, who had
come to complain about burglaries to
their houses.
The Governor ordered an Investigation
of the attack on Magelssen, but the only
result was the arrest of a young Chris
tian" who had attended a marriage on the
previous night and . In whose possession
was found a toy pistol. The American
Vice Consul Indignantly refused to accept
the arrest of this man and decided to
visit his brother-in-law, the American
Consul .General, who was staying In the
mountains to the north of Beirut. :
The Egyptian Gazette mentions that
three months previously Magelssen was
attacked by men in Turkish uniforms,
but whom by his strength he put- to
flight: The paper adds that It is very
dangerous for Europeans to appear on
the streets of Beirut at night. Murder
and pillage are daily occurrences and
many families have moved to Egypt.
WASHINGTON GETS FACTS.
Adpiral Cotton and Minister Leish
man Report on Beirut Tragedy.
WASHINGTON,' Sept. 8.â The Navy De
partment has received the following ca
blegram from Admiral Cotton, dated at
Beirut, September 7:
Violence and bloodshed between Mohamme
dans and native Christians occurred at Beirut
on Sunday. Six Greek Christians, two Mo
hammedans and one Turkish soldier were
killed, and three Greek Christians, three Mo
hammedans and three Turkish soldiers woundr
ed seriously. Other murders are reported. A
flag lieutenant and : the UAtted States Consul
were present on Sunday ' and Monday In the
aisturbed quarter and verify details of this
statement. The Turkish Government willing
ly afforded facilities for their Investigation and
promise 1000 more . Turkish Â¦soldiers. The
Turkish soldiers present are sufficient if prop
erly disposed of to handle the situation at Bel
rut. '-Â¦ The city is well patrolled and all was
quiet Sunday night and to-day (Monday). The
Turkish Government promlst* to do all in Its
power to restore order. Business is suspend
ed. I have prepared to land a force for the
protection of the property of American citi
zens If the situation demands. Will act with
caution.
The last sentence of Admiral Cotton's
cablegram Is unintelligible and the cipher
experts at the Navy /Department worked
all .the morning to . translate it. Copies
of the report were sent at once to the
President and to . the State Department.
The State Department has received a
cablegram from Minister Leishman in
Constantinople, in which he says that a
Any interference on the part of the powers
seems past graying for. Russia and Germany
are urging the Sultan to adopt more vigorous
methods of repression, while the other powers
have apparently no advice to offer and content
thems-lvt-s with the attitude of disinterested
Epectators.
LONDON, Sept. 9.â The Sofia corre
spondent of the Times says the insur
gents have laid up large stores of provis
ions in the mountains and even contem
plate a winter campaign.. The suffering
to the women and children thereby en
tailed would be appalling, but the insur
gent leaders believe that the Ill-clad
Turkish troops will suffer more- than
themselves, owing to thel rinablllty to
obtain supplies in a devastated country
wkh interrupted communications. He
continues:
Joint Interference in the Balkans

Numerous Bulgarian prisoners have
been brought to Monastir. Twenty Bul

about their necks and ankles.
Famine prevails in the district of

HORRIBLE TURKISH MURDERS.
Private letters received from European
residents In Monastir give harrowing de
tails of the situation in that vilayet. Des
titute Bu!garian refugees who are arriv
ing dally in Monaatir relate almost' in
credible tales of Turkish cruelty. Sixty
families recently arrived there from Sml
lefo, which place was totally destroyed.
The refugees saw a husband and wife
sitting in the ruins of their home, when
a Turkish soldier slashed off the man's
head and threw it into the woman's lap.
The soldiers found a servant girl and
several children hiding In a ditch. They
outraged the girl and slaughtered the
children.

The general staff of the insurgents has

"There will always be plenty of time to

riot occurred on Sunday at Beirut, in
which seven Christians were killed and
several wounded. Two houses occupied
by Christians were pillaged by the sol
diers. The panic was general..
Leishman says that the origin of the
trouble is not distinctly stated by our
Consul. He further says that it Is
claimed by the Sublime Porte that con
ditions in Beirut are again quiet and that
the force now there is sufficient to guar
antee the safety of the city. Additional
Instructions have been sent to Minister
Leishman along the lines of those already
forwarded to him, looking to the protec

The Pontiff published to-day his first
official document, consisting of a letter
addressed to Cardinals Vannutelli, Ram
polla, Ferriata and Vives y Tuto, con
firming their appointment by Pope L*o as
a commission to commemorate the fiftieth
anniversary of the dogma of the Immac
ulate conception. .The letter, which Is
very brief, is followed by a prayer to the
Virgin Mary, which will acquire import
ance as being the first to beat the signa
ture of Pius X:
"How bie it is! Beppi should not feel
he is a prisoner. But how he can be
bothered with all these soldiers and offi
cials we cannot see."
The permanent apartment near the San
Angelo bridge will be ready shortly.
It has been, announced .that Pius X
would publish to-day his first encyclical
addressed to the Catholic hierarchy and
people throughout the world, but this was
Incorrect.
In the convent where the Pope's sisters

Speaking of the Vatican, one of the

ROME. Sept. 8.â The three sisters of
Pope Pius X, who lived with him In Ven

not found in Rome quite what they ex
pected. -Not that tney had any' formulated
desires; but.the sisters thought they could
not fail to be certain Qf -resuming their
intimate relation* with; the Pontiff, while
to their unaccustomed eyes all is for
mality. They shrunk from the curious
glances cast at them this morning when
they went out. The sisters, however,
could see no beauty in the" ruins, having
scarcely heard of them. What they liked
host were thp electric streetcars and the
new, wide streets, so different from the
narrow lanes of Venice.

Blames the United States for the
Fighting in Beirut.
BERLIN. Sept. 9.â The newspapers this
morning, in commenting on Sunday's out
break at Beirut, throw the blame for the
occurrence on the United States. The
Lokal Anzeiger says:
Now that the Americans have their dead
they will make Inquiry whether they were
responsible for thÂ» effervescence In Relrut. By
the um.receJenteu action of their Minister In
Constantinople and their naval demonstration
the yearning jf th3 Uaitel States to mix up In

GERMAN PRESS VITRIOLIC.
It is understood here that Turkey Is
anxious to induce the United States to
withdraw the American warships from
Turkish waters, believing that such ac
tion would discourage the Christians,
who hope for American Intervention, and
the Pcrte is now expected to make con
cessions in compliance with the American
representations.
Great Britain's refusal to assent to the
Russian and Austrian proposal that the
powers take coercive diplomatic action at
Sofia with the aim of severing the rela
tions now existing between Bulgaria aria
the Macedonian insurgents Is traced to
her unwillingness to take a step which
might have unforeseen consequences.
Britain's refusal is not definite, and if all
the powers can see their way clear to
adopt the Russo-Austrian proposal she
will participate in the coercion of Bul
garia. It is semi-offlcially stated here
that Italy is willing: to agree to the pro
posal mentioned in the dispatches from
Berlin, but that the consent of France is
doubtful.
LONDON. Sept. 8.â A dispatch to a
news agency from Constantinople says
the Turkish Government is preparing a
circular to the powers calling attention
to the attitude of Bulgaria and declaring
the Intention of the Government to pur
sue armed Bulgarian bandits in Macedon
ia and even into Bulgarian territory.
Official diplomatic circles here regard
the conflict between Mussulmans and
Christians at Beirut as evidence of the
development of hostile feeling throughout
Turkey, as a result of the Macedonian
revolt. This is borne out by the threat
ening uprising in Smyrna. A high Turk
ish official said:
The Christians at Flelrut have -been greatly
encouraged by the appearance of the American
scjuadWn. the presence of which could not be
renamed sympathetically by the Mohammedan
population, because It had come, hot to pay a
friendly call, but to enforce demands.

Revolutionaries.

The" presence of the United States
cruisers Brooklyn and San Francisco at
IJcirut is regarded as a fortunate circum
stance. It is expected that a number of
other forÂ«"iKn warship? will gather there.
The official repcris show that Beirut
is one of three places which are now
center* of great animation. Smyrna,
which hitherto had been comparatively
cuiet, is on the eve of en outbreak.
Great excitement prevails there: The au
thorities are in constant fear of an out
break, but fortunately they have been
able thus far to prevent an 'encounter be
tweta the Christians and^Mussulmans.
The Salonlea advices are again very dis
quieting. It is expected that a general
revolt throughout the Province of Saloni
ca will occur next week. It is the under
ftanding among the foreign officials in
Falonica that a general insurrection will
Fhortly be announced by the Macedonian
committee. In view of this expectation
rigid police measures have been taken by
the Vali, who is showing much energy.
Reports from Monastir say the Insur
rection in that district has been practically
crushed by the extreme measures taken
by the Turkish troops.
The officials here attach significance to
the report showing that a number of
Zerbcs have crossed the border and
joined the Macedonian revolutionists.

Berlin Advices Indicate That Two
Separate Outbreaks Occurred.
BERLIN, S<pt. 6.-A dispatch to the
Lokal Anzeigcr from Constantinople says
thirty Christians, among them being sev
eral Europeans, were killed during the
rioting at Beirut. The Fore'gn Office here
has received no news tending to contlrm
the report published by the Lokal An
xeiger.
Later in the day the Foreign Office re
ct-ived a dispatch from Constantinople,
saying that ten persons were killed dur
inff the recent disorders In Beirut, at
about the time the United States warships
arrived there, but the Foreign Qflice here
lines no connection between the two
events. Among the killed was an Amer
ican.
THIBTY CHBISTIANS KILLED.
These figures are evidently incorrect, as
the rioters must have lost more heavily
than the military.
The British Consul at Beirut immediate
ly after the riot called upon the Vali and
threatened to ask FU-ar Admiral Cotton
to land marines from the American squad
ron in the event of the renewal of dis
turbances.
In official circles here the disturbances
ere attributed to the arrival of the Amer
ican squadron and the be'-ief is expressed
that the Christians at Beirut are endeav
oring to bring about the landing of ma
rines from the warships.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Sept. 8.â A
consular dispatch from Beirut, re
ceived at one of the embassies
here, etatea that a fierce brawl occurred
there on the night of September 6 be
tween parties of Mussulmans and Chris
tians. It was due to a shot fired by a
Mussulman upon a Christian employed at
the American College. The Christian was
wounded. The fig-ht broke out while Vali
was on the United States cruiser Brook
lyn, returning Admiral Cotton's visit. In
diplomatic circles here the affair is re
garded as being serious and a renewal of
the disturbances is feared.
An official version of the Beirut affair
telegraphed to the Ottoman Kmbassadors
abroad for communication to the powers
pays that the Christians were the assail
ants, they having fired upon four Mus
tulmans. A fight ensued, during which
Mussulman? anJ Christians came to the
a^elstance of their respective compatriots.
They, says the report, compelled ..the
troops to Intervene and the latter suc
ceeded in rtHtoring order. Three soldiers

EONDON, . Sect . . 9. â Everything
seems ; to., point to new. and ter
rible . developments - in Macedonia.
On. top of the appalling accounts of the
results of the- Turkish methods, of "re
storing, order" In the vilayet of Monastir
comes the. threat by thie insurgents to
resort to reprisals on the same scale.
The Porte's anxiety to suppress news
by expelling newspaper correspondents
i from the area of operations is held to
have but one 'meaning. This morning'3
papers comment upon the significance of
the news that Russia and Austria are
seeking to persuade the powers to coerce
Bulgaria, a3 showing a belief that war
i3 inevitable.
No further news regarding the out
break at Beirut haa been received here.
A dispatch to the Standard from Con
stantinople, dated Sunday, says:
The Turks are much disturbed by the pres
ence of. the American warships at Beirut and
are making every effort to have them recallco.
In spite of all assertions that the United States
lnteuds to be represented there only for thÂ«j
purpose of protecting the Interests of her citi
zens. It is quite possible that the dispatch of
the warships may initiate action leading much
further.
RUSSIAN SHIPS TO MOVE.
The same correspondent, telegraphing
under Monday's date on receipt of the
news of the Beirut outbreak, says:
With the slightest encouragement disorders
might result in the whole of Lebanon rising in
revolt. To-day had been foretold as the day
of a rising against the foreigners, and many
residents of Constantinople are keeping to their
houies. Personally I doubt wether there will
be anything more than dynamite outrages,
which are pretty sure to be attempted betcre
long.
The Dally Telegraph's correspondent at
St. Petersburg says he is assured on ex
cellent authority that Russia, when she
submits proposals to the Porte for the
pacification of Macedonia, contemplates
the dispatch of her Black Sea squadron
to Turkish waters, where it wfll make a
much longer stay than recently, in order
to overcome the Sultan's objections to
her recommendations.
The Sofia-correspondent of the Morning
Leader says' that by the end of the week
the insurgents will have received a large
accession of weapons. Thirty thousand
rifles are being smuggled In to them from
all sides and when these have been re*
celved the real fighting: will begin.
A Monastir dispatch to the Daily Mail,
dated September 6, says the great mili
tary drive In the mountains to the south
west of Monastir toward Lake Prespa by
a force of 3000 Turkish Infantry, with
twelve euns, resulted In the escape of
all the revolutionary bands. Though the
latter were practically surrounded, not
one was captured. The correspondent con
tinues: '
HINT TO JOUHN.AXISTS.
Vice Consul McGregor tells me that the Porte
has informed Hilmi Pasha that It has received
a threat from the Macedonian committee that
the insurgents Intend to murder a British Con
sul or a Journalist or an American missionary.
Vice Consul McGregor notified the Turkish au
thorities that he would hold them responsible
for any murder by either the Turks or the
Bulgarians. In my opinion, this Is nothing but
a gentle hint to the British Journalists who
are exposing the. massacres,
A Sofia dispatch to the . Dally Mail,
dated September 8, says the revolution
ary committee to-morrow will issue to thÂ«
representatives of the powers a circular
note forewarning them of coming 1 events.
The note is Intended to Justify the future
actions of the insurgents and will point
to the probable total extermination of
the Christians as necessitating the em
ployment of the same atrocious measures
by the revolutionaries against the Turks,
and will -contend that the responsibility
for such desperate acts will rest with the
powers.

posed by a joint meeting of farmers and
their representatives by which the pro
ducers of the country are to protect their
interests. , An association having this a*
its basic principle is in process of organ
ization here.
Farmers and representatives from pro
ducers', associations in nine States are
in conference. Three societies are to be
amalgamated, the foundation for a mons
ter exchange by, which the producers of
the country expect to control the mar
kets, build elevators, establish packing
houses, organize banks, maintain schools
and improve the highways. These asso
ciations are the Producers' and Consum
ers' Union of Tennessee and of New York,
with 400,000 members: the American So
ciety of Equity of North America, with
â¬0,000 members, and the Farmers' National
Co-operative Exchange Company, with a
membership of 20,000.^
The day was devoted to the discussion
of plans. It was proposed that the new
association should be incorporated for
$100,000,000. - The i representatives of the
American Society of Equity sought to
have Its, name and declaration of princi
ples adopted, but the convention tabled

ST. PAUL, Sept. 7. â The principal
speaker at the Labor day picnic here yes
terday was Archbishop Ireland. He spoke
in part as follows:
A country without capital is impoverished.
Labor should invite it Into use; never frighten
it away by making it unsafe or depriving It
of reasonable profits. On the other hand, capi
tal must respect the manhood of the wage
earner and allow him, as far as It can without
loss to itself, a fair wage. Extravagant and
needless expenditures by capitalists do harm
In irritating the poor Riid should be avoided.
A generous use of capital for the public good,
whether in purely beneficent or Industrial en
terprises, does much to soften the asperities of
opposition. ..
We should not be afraid of capital, in what
ever form it comes, whether in large personal
accumulation or In ' trusts or In syndicates.
Names are bugaboos that should not frighten.
As a matter of fact, without large aggrega
tions cf capital great enterprises are not pos
sible, and the country is not developed. It Is
time enough to hold the hand against trusts
and syndicates when they do harm. I If they
are known to do harm the country will attend
to them. If they do no harm and. on, the
contrary, do good, they should be welcomed.
The waue-earner has rightsâ his right to a
living wage, his right to reasonable hours, his
right to more than even a living wage when
circumstances and success warrant it. Waee
earners have a right to combine and form
trusts and syndicates and call them labor
unions. Labor guilds were common In the
middle ages and did good. Labor unions have
given wasre-earners the consciousness to their
rights and have' done much to obtain, higher
wages and shorter hours. Hut labor unions
must bo on their gulard against ssrlous evils
threatening them. They cannot be tolerated If
they Interfere with the personal liberty of non
union men .-who have a right to work in or
outside unions as they please. Public opinion
and public law will and must protect this lib
erty. It were social chaos if we were to Im
pose our opinions on others by force. What
rishf have I to Impose my religious belief by
force? What rlcht have labor unions to Im
pese their opinions by force?
It is wrong In labor unions to limit the out
put of work on the part of members. The
members themselves are injured: they are re
duced to a dead level of inferiority. They, are
allowed no opportunity of rising to a . higher
or better position. Society is injured as It Is
Injured by 'everything that prevents Its mem
bers from putting out their talent to best ad
vantage. . . ,

NEW YORK. Ff!>t. K.â RiBht Rev. Daniel
Tuttle. Bithop of MlF.^ouri. has become senior
BiFhop of the ProteFtant Episcopal Church by
the death of the Right Ilcv. Thomas Clark.
Bishop of lihode Island.
The Board of Trustees this evening re
ceived a petition asking for the reappoint
ment of City Marshal Tibbet. A sensation
al scene ensued. The petition was signed
by five citizens, and the attorney ~ for
the Marshal explained that it was pre
sented on account of doubts arising as
to the regularity of his former appoint
ment,-the same having been made a few
hours before the late Marshal , Packard'^
term expired.'' . Â¦ Â¦' . ,\
Former State Senator S. C. Smith, who
represents the contestant, E. P. Davis, in
the case now "pending, in a speech de
nounced the petition and attacked the mo
tives of Marshal Tibbet for presenting It
at this time. He declared it to be a use
less proceeding, f Intended simply to . em
barrass ' litigation. Following Immediate
ly the theft of the ballots which it was
sought to have recounted, he said It was
simply an outrage. If any appointment
were to be made it should not be done
until the Marshal had cleared himself
from the imputation which in the mind
of the people, rested on him.. After a Jong
wrangle the board laid the matter over
until next Monday evening.
Before he could qualify he was killed in
the battle with Outlaw McKlnney and the
City Trustees apolnted Tibbet to fill the
vacancy. Davis, with permission of the
Attorney General, began quo warranto
proceedings to establish his right to the
office and the matter is now pending in
the SuDerlor Court.
Everything depended on the recount of
the ballots. If Packard received a ma
jority of the votes, then Davis was out
of the race and the right of Tibbet to the
office would have been established, but if
Davis received a majority the appoint
ment of Tibbet would be proven illegal.
The affair has created a sensation here.
It is presumed that some one entered the
room in the day time, as the doors of the
vault were left open to give the city of
ficials access to the records.
BAKERSFIELD, Sept. 8.â When City
Clerk Lightner returned from a two
weeks' absence thieves had entered the
vault in which are kept the city records
and had stolen the ballots and election
papers upon which hinged the result of
the contest now pending between E. P.
Davis and Bert M. Tlbbet for the office
of City Marshal.
In April last at the municipal election
the principal contestants for the office of
City Marshal were E. P. Davis and the
late T. J. Packard. The returns showed
that Packard was elected Iby five votes
and the certificate of election was given
him.

Algeria, state that the recent defeat of
the insurgents by a French force near
Almoungar. in which the French lost
sixty-seven killed and forty-seven wound
ed, was one of the most brilliant feats
of the French army In Algeria. â¢
It appears that the insurgents Inter
cepted a convoy, the escort of which,
consisting of 120 men, resisted the at
tack of between 3000 and 4000 Moors for
eight hours. The little French force suf
fered greatly from thirst, but after inflict
ing heavy losses on the assailants, suc
ceeded In repulsing them. The French
relieving force found the Moors' line of
retreat scattered for a mile with dead
and wounded. Lieutenant Satcenhauser,
who is a Dane, and a sergeant have since
died of their wounds. The French dead,
excepting General Vauchez, were buried

i rants can be served.
I Two other Important events occurred
to-day in the postal inquiry. Leopold
Stern, the Baltimore contractor, who left
Baltimore before he could be arrested on
an indictment returned on July 31 last,
was located in Toronto, and the long de
layed surrender of George W. Beavers,
the former head of the Salary and Allow
ance Division, to the New York authori
ties took place.
The postal officials have been search
ing for Stern ever since he disappeared
from Baltimore, and finally received word
from the Canadian authorities that he
was In Toronto. They expressed much
surprise at the premature publication of
his whereabouts, on account of the prob
lem of extradition that now confronts the
Government and the possibility of his
making good his escape, now that the In
formation has become public in advance
of the readiness of the authorities to ef
fect his arrest. Beavers' arrest caused
/no surprise, for the Government all along
has kept advised of his whereabouts.
TORONTO, Ont.. Sept. 8.â Leopold
Stern 'refused to be seen when a reporter
called at his home to-day. He referred
all callers to his attorney. Stern's law
yers said' that their client was ready to
appear before an extradition judge and
prove his innocence, which is Interpreted
a? a declaration that extradition proceed
ings will be fought to the end. He would
not leave the city, the attorneys said,
and if an' extradition warrant were se
cured Stern would at once leave for
Washington.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 8.-After deliber
ating several weeks over a mass of docu
ments submitted by the postofflce Inspec
tors, the Federal Grand Jury in this city
returned seven indictments In postal
cases involving six different persons. All
of the indictments were kept off the pub
lic; record, and both the officials of the
District Attorney's office and of the Post
office Department refused to discuss the
names or. details of the indictments until
the persons Indicted shall have been ar
rested. It is expected that arrests will
occur' to-morrow morning and that the
Postofflce Department will have some an
nouncement to make during the fore
noon.

j "All these facts and many more which
have been gathered by Sheriff H. V.
Trafton and Chief of Police Rassetce of
Watsonville will be turned over to the
Grand Jury. The Inquest over the body
of Mrs. Green was merely a formal one.
I regret that I was not notified in time
that I might have been present and in
terrogated the witnesses. The examina
tion of Green last Saturday night was a
searching one and the testimony taken
I down by Court Reporter Williamson will
\ be transcribed and used at the hearing."
i There is some talk in this section of ex
huming the body of Mrs. Green and hold
ing an autopsy over the remains. This
| may be done in order to ascertain wheth
i'er a drug was used on the alleged victim.
j A great deal of discussion is being heard
around Watsonville. Some of the wise
' men cannot understand how Green es
j caped death by gas asphyxiation. It is a
j fact that Green occupied the same room
J with his wife and that he slept on the
; side of the bed nearest the adjoining
I room where the gas jet was. Dr. Briggs
I announced that Mrs. Green had been
i dead half an hour when he was called in
and yet Green recovered very quickly and
was around the next day consulting a
lawyer to learn whether he should make
an immediate application to be appointed
administrator of his wife's estate. These
facts and the. further fact that Mrs.
I Laura I-a Schells. his housekeeper, re-
I turned to the house Immediately on the
! death of Mrs. Green make .it look some-
I what mysterious.
An effort will be made to make Mrs. La
: Scheils tell what she knows of the case.
I It Is thought that if she could be made
I Xo talk she might divulge some interest
j ing things.
| GREEN'S STATEMENT DENIED.
Green states that the gas was in the
! house but three months and his wife
I turned It out and lighted It at different
I times. Mrs. C. P. Terwilliger stated to
day that Mrs. Green i.ever bothered/
about the gas. She says the deceased
would always call her in to light it and
to turn !t down low. . ' .'- *i- > Â¦Â¦
Mrs.- La Schells strenuously denies that
j she was ordered out of the house by Mrs.
j Green and vet the Sheriff has secured a
j witness who will testify that she was
i and that during her absence Mrs. La
| Schells corresponded with Green through
: the agency of a Mrs. Hilborn,.who lived
' in the house. These leUers were sent In
i an envelope addressed to Mrs. - Hilborn
i and were turned over to Green. The
Â¦ Sheriff is now trying to locate Mrs. HI1
i born. This same witnes.s will testify that
' she would not allow Mrs. La Schells to
' stay in the house, but Mrs. Green was
j very charitably Inclined and did not want
to turn her out of doors. She then took
Mrs. La Schells to her side of the house
and allowed her to use an adjoining
apartment. This witness will also testify
that she called Mrs. Green's attention to
the actions of Mrs. La Schells and Mrs.
Green replied, "It takes me long to
tumble," and the witness replied, "Then
it is about time you were tumbling, Mrs.
Green."
INQUEST MEBELY FORMAL.
WATSONVILLE, Sept. 8.â Dis r
trlct Attorney B. K. Knight
of Santa Cruz County an
nounced this afternoon that
he woufd makt a special plea
to the Superior Court that the Grand
Jury of the county be called into session
next month to take up the investigation
of the death of Mrs. Elvira J. Scales-
Green. As a rule the Grand Jury meets
but once a year, but the demand of the
residents of this county that immediate
steps be taken has led the District At
torney to hasttn action.
When the Grand Jury meets Mr.
Knight will lay all the evidence he has
gathered before them and leave It to
their judgment whether an indictment
should be Issued against Robert Green,
the husband of the writer, whose un
timely taking off has created a suspicion
of foul play In the minds of her numer
ous friends.
"While I have Investigated the matter
very thoroughly," said the District At
torney, *'I do not think I have sufficient
evidence to allow me to have a warrant
Issued for the arrest of Green. His state
ments to me are conflicting and, there are
facts which lead me to believe that a
crime has been committed. For instance,
before Mrs. Green's death her husband
made an unsuccessful attempt to gain
possession of her property. He tricl to
get his wife to deed over a ranch she
owned, but she refused. On another oc
casion, where his wife had taken a mort
gage on some property, ne had his name
inserted as mortgagee and when she dis
covered It Mrs. Green had the name
stricken out and her own substituted.

Regarding the complaint of John Bowtn
and Richard Roderick, contractors for
driving rock tunnels, etc., against the ac
tion of their employes under the award
of the anthracite coal strike commission,
the employes having gone on strike, de
manding a 10 per cent advance in wages
granted to contract miner's, the umpire
decides that "contractors driving .rock
tunnels, sinking shafts and other similar
work, not beinc parties to the submls-
Bion, nor having agreed to abide by the
awards of the anthracite coal strike com
mission; are not- parties under the award
and have no standing before the board
of conciliation."
All discharges, as all qulttale, should * be
made on a reasonable basis. The employer and
employe should treat each other with Justice
and a desire to preserve oeace. Attempts
should be made in all such casas to adjust
the matter between the employe or employes
affected and a superintendent and such at
tempt was not made In this case.
I am clearly of the opinion, as in the case
of Coxe Bros. & Co., that the Lehlgh Coal, and
Navigation Company ought to give preference !
to all their old men â those employed prior to ]
the â¢ strike â who have not been convicted ot
crime committed durinr the strike or are not
now under arrest awaiting trial or are not in
competent or not guilty of misdemeanor to
render their employment undesirable. The
terms of the submission and the' language of
the award under it make this conclusion in
evitable.
Leading up to the final award, the um
pire says: Â¦ . .;
There can be no doubt that a man has a
right to quit the service of his employer when
ever he tees fit, with or without Bivinjr any
cause, provided he Elves proper notice, and
that the employer has a perfect right to em
ploy and discharge men in accordance with the
conditions of his industry; that he is not
obliged to give any cause for discharge, but
that he should, as in the reverse case, give
proper notice.
ThlÂ« right to discharge must, therefore, be
sustained. Any other view of the case would
result !n compelling men to work for an em
ployer when they did not wish to. and thus
enslave them, when, on the other hand, it
would compel employers to'employ men whether
they had work for them or not, and whether
the men were incompetent or not, and would
thus stagnate business and work to the injury
of all other employes.
SPIRIT OF JUSTICE NEEDED.
Regarding the complaint of discrimina
tion and blacklisting of employes in the
Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company,
who were reinstated at the end of the
strike, the umpire decides that it has not
been shown that the men were discrimi
nated against on account of. their mem
bership in the union, but is of the opin
ion that discrimination existed against a
small number of men, and makes this
statement:
OPPOSES DISCBIMINATION.
SCRANTONV Pa., Sept. 8.-Carroll D.
Wright, the umpire to whom was referred
the five disputes between the operators
and miners' representatives on the beard
of conciliation appointed under the pro
visions of the anthracite mine strike com
mission, filed his findings to-day with T.
D.- Nicholls, secretary of the board. In
dealing with the question of the em
ployers' right to discharge men for any
cause other than of connection with a
labor union, Umpire Wright agrees
wholly with the contention of the opera
tors' representatives and declares that the
right of an employer to discharge with
out giving the cause of the discharge is
sustained by the award of the commis
sion.
He says that the Lehigh Coal and Nav
igation Company and Coxe Bros. & Co.
should take back old men instead of put
ting on new men in all cases where the
old men are competent and have not
been convicted or not awaiting trial for
crime committed during the strike. The
umpire's findings cover twenty-five pages
of typewriting.' Regarding the case as a
Â¦whole, he says:
The opinion 13 rendered that all the nien
employed by Cose Bros. & Co., Incorporated,
at the time of the strike in 1002, except those
who have been convicted of crime durlns the
strike or who are Ftlll under arrest or to whom
employment cannot be given en account of new
machinery or who are Incompetent ought to
be preferred to new men In giving out work
when they apply therefor.
Buckley and Brooks immediately went
to Police Headquarters and reported the
matter to Captain cf Detectives Martin.
The latter detailed Detectives Wrenn and
Pinan en the case. They worked on it all
day and night, but were unable to find
a single clew that rrsipht lead to the cap
ture of the burglars.
The strange part of the story is that no
one but their victims saw the men either
l.ofcre or after they pained entrance to
the house. It is supposed that they had
watched their chance from a small alley
way near the place and when no one was
looking walked up the stairs and entered
the room occupied by Buckley and
Brooke; which is directly at the head of
the stairs on the second floor.
to breathe a word of what had happened
under penalty of death. The frightened
pair soon recovered their senses and rush
ed out into the hallway, but the burglars
nowhere to be seen, having vanish
ed as mysteriously as they entered the
place. \
The burglars, still cot-ering their vic
tims with their pistils, backed out of the
room, warning Buckley and Brooks not
They did as they were ordered and the
tall man proceeded to so through their
clothe. From Buckley he took a dia
mond ring valued at $300. a sold watch
and chain said to be worth $200, and sev
eral dollars In silver, all the money he
had on his person at the time.
Then thp robt>*r went through Brooks'
clothes ,-nid obtained a handsome diamond
ring valued at S3W. a diamond sunburst
worth $500, more than $100 in coin and
three smaller stones, in all about. $1100,
according to Brooks' own statement.
BACK OUT OF ROOM.
Each carried a gun and Buckley and
his companion were covered with the
weapons before they had a chance to
make a. move. Then the taller of the
robbers commanded the occupants of the
room to throw up their hands and move
lo one corner.
According to the stories told by Buck-
Icy and Brooks, they went up to the room
shortly before noon and as the day was
extremely hot the doer was left open.
They were engaged in conversation, when
suddenly two masked men silently en
tered the room and closed the door be
hind them.
The robbery Is one cf the most sensa
tional that hes occurred here in years
and the police are of the opinion that the
perpetrators of the daring deed are none
other than the men who have been hold-
Ing up and robbing the various corner
procerics throughout the city during the
last few weeks.
VALUABLE JEWELRY TAKEN.
Brooks and Buckley are well known
characters about town and have always
Veen plentifully supplied with coin. They
v.tre ulso in the habit of wearing a lot
of valuable jewelry. From the way they
\*-<re held up it would appear that they
have bern watched by the daring thieves
and were taken unawares.
Two daring burglars entered a lodging
house at Z.2 OFarrell street during the
noor. hour yesterday and with drawn pis
tols commanded Kdward Buckley and
I'eter Brooks, two lodgers, to throw up
their hands. Then the robbers went
through their victims' clothes and took
everything of value they possessed, $1600
worth In all. With a final word of warn
ing- to thtir victims not to utter a cry
under penalty of death, the burglars left
the place as quietly as 'they had entered,
and the efforts of the j>clice to locate them
have been futile.

WHAT TO DO.
There is comfort In the knowledge so
often expressed that Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, the great kidney and bladder rem-
edy, fulfills every vish in curinc rheuma-
tism, pain In the back, kidneys, liver,
bladder and every part of the urinary
passage. It corrects inability to hold wa-
ter and scalding pain In passing it. or bad
effects following use of liquor, wine or
beer, and overcomes that unpleasant ne-
cessity of \ ~ing compelled to go often dur-
ing the day. and to get up many times
during the night. The mild and the ex-
traordinary effect of Swamp-Root Is soon
realized. It stands the highest for its
wonderful cures of the most distressing

The following was the order of the pro

day by those who will go by early morn

The streets along the line of march were
crowded with people who lustily cheered
as the boys moved along and spoke words
of encouragement to many-vwho did not
reconcile corns with uneven pavements.
Bombs and red fire added to the dis
play and when the marchers reached the
Townsend-street depot there was a rush
for the train In order to secure seats. As
the Natives were passing Uhrough the
gates they were cheered by their friends,
who reminded them that they would see
them In San Jose In the mornlne.
Mayor Schmitz. who had been selected
as an aid to the grand marshal, evidently
had an objection to horseback riding, for
he marched with the parlor In which he
holds his membership.
MAYOR SCHMITZ WALKS.
TBOOPS WEEE TAEDY.
According to programme, there should
have been two companies of the First
Regiment of the National Guard to follow
the police and act as escort, but they
came to the- rendezvous as the proces
sion was well under way. To make up
for lost time the command "Double
quick" was given and after a lively run
down Mason street they got into posi
tion before the head of the line reached
Market street, and it was a run that
brought out the perspiration and gave
the boys in blue an object lesson that will
no doubt serve them in future when they
agree to serve as escort to a civic body.
The military escort consisted of Com
panies A and G, commanded by Captains
Ballinger and Wall, respectively, and then
followed the grand marshal with Harry
I. Mulcrevey, his chief of staff, and
mounted aids. Then came the different
parlors, some in uniform, others in citi
zens' dress, but all enthusiastic and keep
ing step to the music of two bands hired
for escort duty and the rataplan of 100
drums, each drummer trying to get as
much noise, out of his sheepskin as there
was in It.
The parlors which made the most at
tractive display were Stanford, with its
Immense banner: Bay City, the members
of which carried golden hued flags with
the name of the parlor printed thereon;
Alcalde, with its fancily dressed drill
corps; Army and Navy, in khaki uni
forms: Marshall Parlor, in niiners' suits:
Twin Peaks Parlor, the members of which
shaded themselves from the rays of the
moon by means of Japanese parasols; El
Capitan, the members in white suits and
each carrying a small package contain
ing a baby cap and nursing bottle, and
National Parlor, with its magnificent ban
ner.
llcemen under command of Sergeant Wolf
wheeled into company front, leading the
procession and driving away scores of
small boys who followed the red flre
wagon.
Then came a long line of Native Sons,
in which was Olympus Parlor and drum
corps, California Parlor iind drum corps,
Alcatraz Parlor and others. Red flre
was burned and Roman candles were dis
charged. The people along the line
cheered the natives and these responded.
A number of the visitors carried cowbells
and horns.
During the parade a perfect . pandemo
nium reigned and the streets were so
crowded that it was with difficulty that
the parade moved. Tho line of march
was up First street to San Antonio and
back.
At 11:30 the Twin Peaks Parlor arrived
and with its flfe and drum corps paraded
the streets. Many of the parlors that
came on the later trains went straight to
their headquarters. After the - parlora
reached their headquarters the members
disbanded and started out to look for
friends. Every hotel in town Is crowded
with Natives. The headquarters of the
local parlors in Native Sons' Hall was
visited by hundreds. Never before have
San Jose streets shown such life at night.
At midnight the whole town was filled
with jollification, and shouts and songs
of the parading Native Sons showed that
a merry birthday anniversary was In
store for the Golden State.
RECEPTION FOR PIONEERS.
Company I, Fifth Regiment, N. G. C. of
Llvermore, arrived this evening to parti
cipate in to-morrow's parade. A number
of pioneers accompanied the Native Sons
and these will be entertained to-morrow
by the local Society of Pioneers. At a
late hour to-night squads of Native Sons
and Daughters are still parading the
streets.
About 3000 more members and friends
of the order are expected to-morrow. A
committee consisting of Fred Doerr, M.
Griffith, Miss Iva Belloli, Mrs. Virginia
Gruwell and Mrs. G. A. Koerber are re
ceiving at the Native Sons' headquarters.
An orchestra is furnishing music for
dancing and refreshments are being
served.
St. James Park, was a scene of gayety
all evening. The Native Sons had ar
ranged a band concert by the Fifth Reg
iment band. Â¦ Electric lights were distri
buted about the grounds, and thousands
of people gathered there and passed the
evening. .
The Admission day bicycle, motor cycle
and automobile races at Agricultural
Park are attracting a great deal of at
tention. These races are to be held under
the auspices of the Cycling Board of
Trade. There are nearly 100 entries of
the five bicycle races and they include
speedy riders from Stockton, Sacramento,
San Francisco, Oakland and Los Angeles.
The principal event will be the ten
mile point race between teams of the
principal bicycle clubs. Each team will
be represented by five men who will each
ride two miles. There will be a three
mile and a five-mile race for the motor
cycles, with ten to twelve entries. There
are also several automobile races on the
card.
LOCATION OF HEADQUARTERS.
The location of the headquarters of the

by the fact that Governor Pardee could
rot come until to-morrow, inasmuch as
the report announcing- his delay was not
divulged to the public.
A brilliant and animated scene was pre
6cnted at the depot by the throngs col
lected there. The side streets, lighted
vith strings of electric lamps, v.-ere
densely packed with vehicles and crowded
â¢with pedestrians. A passageway down

penters. The ladies of the Retail Clerk's
.Association were driven in open carriages
and called forth much applause from the
Fpectators.
A number of floats indicative of differ
ent crafts wore in line and attracted fav
orable comment. The hoi-seshoers had a
moving shop In which two craftsmen
turned out first-class shors as the vehicle
moved along the streets.
Several business firm's in the city had
(special representations in the line, one
of the most striking of these being 1 a
group of riders from a meat market, each

a few remarks by Mayor Clark and a
ehort address each by Lon Bond of Chleo
and Walter Macarthur of San Francisco.
The latter gentleman dwelt at some

SANTA ROSA, Sept. 8.-A. J. McKin
non, former Sheriff of Washington. Coun
ty, Or., was shot and Instantly killed thiÂ»
morning at Guernevllle, twenty miles
northwest of here, by an escaped lunatic
from the Ukiah. asylum, named Jerraud.
. McKinnon came here two or three years
ago, after having resigned his office in
Oregon, and purchased a ranch not far
from town. It seems that while Sher
iff he was once compelled to take Jer
raud to an asylum in Oregon and for that
the latter cherished resentment. \ .
As McKinnon and" Jacob Joos, the lat
ter a well known business man of this
place and Guerneville, were sitting to
gether on Joost's porch Jerraud came
along, pulled a pistol and fired without
warning. His aim was perfect and Mc-
Kinnon toppled over dead.
McKinnon's death is deeply regretted,
as he had made many friends since tak
ing up his residence in this county. Jer
raud escaped, but officers are on his trail.
He got away from the Ukiah asylum two
months aco. Â»

Special Dlapatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 8.â Colonel Grif
fith J. Griffith failÂ«d to send to Mayor
Snyder to-day his resignation as a mem
ber of the Board of Park Commissioners
and in conformity with the announcement
made yesterday the Mayor issued an of
ficial statement of his removal from, that
office.
Under the provisions of the city charter
the Mayor has the power to remove a
Commissioner with the approval of the
City Council, and there Is little doubt
but that body will approve his action.
A successor to Griffith has been decided
upon, but until it- ia known that he will
accept official announcement of his ap
pointment will not be made. It Is con
sidered probable that Colonel Griffith will
take no steps to prevent the City Coun
cil from approving the Mayor's action,
but that he will pay no attention to the
matter.
The case against Griffith on the charge
of attempting to murder his wife was
called In the Police Court to-day. Grif
fith appeared In court, accompanied by
his eon. After he had been formally ar
raigned the attorneys agreed upon Oc
tober 2 as the date for the examination.
The agreement was reached that If Mrs.
Griffith Is unable to be present on that
date the time will be extended.
Mrs. Griffith Is slowly recovering from
tho effect of her Injuries. The danger
point Is not yet passed, but with a con
tinuation of the present favorable condi
tion her ultimate recovery will be only
a matter of weeks. It was announced to
day by her physicians that she proba
bly wjll not be able to leave the hospital
in less than a month.

GREATNESS OF AMERICA.
A people's prosperity is not measured by Its
capacity to produce more than by Its capacity
to consume, and ;his capacity to consume is in
turn dependent upon the earning capacity of
th* individual, and the earning capacity of the
individual is again dependent upon native and
acquired ability. So If America be great. It Is
because God in Hl5 wisdom stored the moun
tains with the richest minerals, overlaid the
valleys wira a most fertile soil and then cave
it to people competent, in some slight degree
at least, to improve their opportunities.

president, Hon. J. H. Richards of Boise.

We grow three-fourths of the world's cotton

far above the present product.
We produce 40 per cent of the world's output

Â¦we produced nearly 10.000.000 tons of pislron.
We produce more coal than Great Britain,
more than twice as much as Germany, and
nearly double that of all countries except Great

'Manufacture is equally dependent upon agri

pointed a committee of three to draft;
I resolutions thanking President Roosevelt
j for his recognition of the congress in

j before It.
j The Secretary was scheduled to address
, the congress on "The Mining Industry
[ and lt<? Relation to American Finances."
j He said he wished to correct the in>
j pression that he was to deliver an ad
' dress because he really did not know
j anything about mining. We make a mis
| take, he said, if v.e estimate the lmport
! ance of our different industries according
: to their relative products.
: He referred to the necessitv of in
j creased markets for our' products, saying
! -he would rather have the market of the
| United States th.in all of the markets of
i the rest of the world: would rather havs
j the productive capacity of the United
i States than the productive capacity of
j nearly all the rest of the world. He said
: we have to get some more markets for
| our products. As to how many more mar
kets are to be created he pointed to the
. countries lying to the south of the United
' States and said in his judgment the Gov

Miss Relma possesses a fine mezzo

ward to her success.
Two of the daring footpads who have been giving
San Franciscans the shivers of late have been cap

THE newly issued yearbook of the Department
oi Agriculture contains in the report of the
Secretary a striking passage upon the waste that
has followed the partial destruction of the forests
at the headwaters of the streams of the Appalachian
Mountains. That part of the United States is far
from California, but not so far but what the lesson
of its teaching should come home to us and warn
us of the danger that threatens our own land from
the waste of the woodlands.
It is estimated that during the twelve months end
ing with April, 1902, the damage done by floods re
sulting from the destruction of forests along that
mountain district approximated $18,000,000. The Te
port goes on to say: "The examinations also show as
additional results of the deforestation of these moun
tain slopes that the water powers along these streams,
which have an aggregate annual value of $20,000,000,
as a basis for manufacturing enterprises, are being
gradually but certainly destroyed through the in
creasing irregularity in the flow of the streams; that
the soil which is being washed down from the moun
tain slopes is rendering annually less navigable the
Ohio, Mississippi,' Tennessee and other rivers of the
Southeastern States; and that the rate of land ero
sion on these mountain slopes from which the forest
cover has been removed is now as great in a single
year as it was in ten centuries while the slopes were
covered with primeval forests."
A statement of that kind emanating from an official
source after expert investigation is startling. The at
tention of the. Eastern public has been drawn to the
evil and a bill is now before Congress providing for
the establishment, of a great national forest , reserve
along the Appalachian summits. The maintenance
of such a reserve will of course be highly beneficial
to. all the wide region of country through which flow
the streams that have their rise in those mountains;
but great as is the need of a good forestry system
in that section of the country^itis probably not so
great as : the need of such a system in California.
It is indeed high time for us to approach this sub
ject seriously and with a resolve to take action before
the destruction of the woods goes much further. Man
cannot afford to so waste the mountain lands as to
bring about every year an erosion. equal to that which
nature would have caused in ten centuries.
The Alaska Packers'* Association makes
the statement that Its advices received
lately from Alaska do not confirm the
news of the drowning of nine men in
Bristol Bay, as reported on August 29

erroneous.

are sent by fast mail. The department is also in
formed by cable of shipments, and the cable advices
are made explicit, so that the mail advices need not

been adopted for this purpose. The analyses have
each been completed by the chemistry bureau of the
Department of Agriculture in two days, and beyond
WHEN it was announced that the Depart
ment of Agriculture would set its chemists
.to work to inspect every kind and grade of
food and of drink products that reached our custom
houses seeking access to our markets there was a
clamor from Europe that we should have trouble.
So insistent were the declarations of hostility to the
new law that the officials of the Department of Ag
riculture were compelled to repeat again and again
their assurances that the enforcement of the new
policy would injure no legitimate industry, but on
the contrary would benefit one and all by ridding
them of the competition of unscrupulous manufactur
ers of adulterated or falsely labeled goods.
The law has now been in force for some time, and
the results have proven that the fears of injury to
foreign producers and of possible retalia
tion on the part of European Governments were ut
terly unfounded. In fact, the former exporters of
objectionable goods have profited by the warning
given by the publication of the law and have made
no effort to get their goods into our market. It is
stated that while upward of a hundred cargoes of for
eign food and drink products have been inspected by
the government chemists, not a single sample has
shown the slightest adulteration.

ANSWERS TO QUEREIS.
PERSONAL MENTION
THE footlights have attracted an
other Callfornlan girl, Miss Marie
Relma. who is about to leave for
New York to win new laurels.
Society has claimed Miss Relma
for the last few years, but a New York
manager has recently prevailed upon her.
Mayor Schmitz' platform in this city demands a
general system of public utilities. The industries
which it proposes to include in a scheme of business
carried on by the city will involve a capital but little
less than $100,000,000, which it is proposed to com
pel the taxpayers to supply by taxation, and which
is to become a lien upon the city instead of upon the
plants which it creates. It is admitted that the ad
ministration of these vast business systems by fc the
city will be more costly than under private owner-'
ship. The Examiner, in attempting to justify making 1
the Geary-street Railroad bonds a lien upon the city
instead of upon the road, says: "'The traffic will grow
immensely. * * * There would be a substantial
sum which the city could dispose of as it saw fit. This
sum would go in part to the employes, in meeting
the extra expense of the eight-hour day required by
the charter."
The industries which the Mayor's platform pro
poses to run as public utilities have now about 8000
employes. Who doubts that their influence in
politics will be immediately enlisted in removing their
wages from the influence of supply and demand and
making them subject to legislation by the city gov
ernment? Does any one expect soon to see a city
government here that will not seek and hold power
by granting every demand of that kind? The result
will be that all this "extra expense" will be legislated
out of the pockets of the taxpayers instead of com
ing out of the income of the vast and varied busi
nesses which it is proposed the city shall manage.
What may be expected to happen has already hap
pened in Kansas City in the municipal ownership and
administration of the water supply. The rate re
mains the same as that charged by the private water
company, the income has increased only 13 per cent,
and the expense has increased ever 90 per cent. Now
when that increase, which is an actual deficit, is
charged off to the general fund, the ratepayer is left
in ignorance of the cost of his water supply, caused
by the increase in wages paid.
There is only one right way in business, either pub
lic or private, and that way dictates the putting of
all bonds, and their interest, and the cost of admin
istration, upon the plant which they create.
SO far there is no answer to our demand that
public utility bonds be a lien on the plants
which they create and not upon the taxpayers
of the city. By such plan only can there be secured
an approach to honest and proper management of a
business investment by the city. Take a water sys
tem as an example. If the bonds that acquire it and
the cost of its administration and extension be
charged to the ratepayers in the cost to them of the
supply, they have not only the ready means of com
paring it with a system under corporate management,
but also of judging whether it is honestly and eco
nomically administered. Every year the balance
sheet of the city's water system is put .before the rate
payers; if income and outgo be equal they know it;
if there be a surplus they see in it a reason for a less
rate; if there be a deficit they see in it a reason for
a larger water rate. **
This applies especially to Oakland, where the prop
osition to acquire a public water system is somewhat
more advanced than in San Francisco. If in that
city a bond interest and sinking fund is charged off
to the general fund, and annual deficits are put upon
the taxpayer instead of the ratepayer, these items are
concealed in the tax receipt, and knowledge is kept
from the ratepayer, who may think that he is getting
his water cheaper because part of its cost is unknown
to him, and he may be paying a higher rate than
before without knowing it. Again, as the payment
of the cost of water supply is imperative, that part
of it that is concealed in the general levy will have
to be provided for, and the result will be the scaling
down of the levy for the essential purposes of gov
ernment, such as schools, police, fire and proper
maintenance of streets, and similar things that go to
the protection, sanitation and just government of the
city.
PUBLIC UliLlTY BONDS.
TALENTED CALIFORNIA GIRL WHO IS ABOUT TO DEPART FOR NEW
YORK, WHERE SHE WILL APPEAR IN OPERA UNDER THE DI
RECTION OF A WELL-KNOWN MANAGER.
Minister Bowen has done the interests of our
people and the dignity of his Government great harm
by his mushy blatherskiting in the interest of the
bandit fiend Castro of Venezuela. The Latin-Ameri
cans attribute his attitude to fear of them and take
him as expressing the cowardice of our Government.
What is needed in Latin-America is the resentment
of these insults to our Government, even to the ex
tent of a thorough thrashing of one of those states,
and Colombia would be a good place to begin. If
that Government had suppressed communication be
tween the British Foreign Office and the Minister
to Bogota she would be in trouble of the most serious
kind immediately. What our own Government needs
is the support of a proper American conception of
the rights of Americans abroad, and especially a pub
lic opinion immediately resentful of such acts as this
suppression of our official dispatches.
During the revolution three or four years ago in
Guatemala Americans in the seaport appealed in vain
to their Minister for protection, and had to give
some of their property to Englishmen, who informed
the British Minister at Guatemala City, and imme
diately a British gunboat appeared in the harbor and
her captain took command of the town under a
threat to bombard it if his authority were not re
spected. These things are intensely humiliating to
Americans, and they inspire those pestilent states
with contempt for our Government. Primarily the
fault is with our own people, who do not seem to
understand that it is the duty of this Government to
protect its citizens and their property abroad in re
turn for the allegiance which it demands of them.
IT is established as a fact that official dispatches be
tween our State Department and the American
Minister to Colombia, were sequestered by the
Colombian Government, and all communication by
wire with our representative was cut off for nearly
a month, during the discussion of the canal treaty
in the Colombian Congress. '
The offense is a serious one. In international re
lations it amounts almost to an act of war. The
first claim hi sovereignty is the right of unrestricted
communication with our Ministers sent to foreign
countries. To deny that is to insult our Government
in a manner that requires the vindication of its dig
nity. Colombia, like most of the petty governments
of Central America, controls all the telegraph sys
tem. It is a Government institution, and therefore
the suppression of these official dispatches is the
direct act. of the Government.
The disposition behind . it is that of most, of the
Latin- American states. Our Government has been
slow to treat those states as it' does the rest of the
world. It does not enforce the rights of our citizens
within their jurisdiction, and has permitted the rob
bery and oppression of Americans to such an extent
that the whole group of Latin states in this hemi
sphere have become convinced that it is safe not only
to rob our citizens but to insult our Government.
During the war between Chile and Peru an Amer
ican was an officer in the Peruvian army. He was
taken in battle along with other prisoners of war,
and he alone was immediately condemned to be
shot. When the American Consul was appealed to
he refused to interfere to prevent the barbarity. But
when an American sea captain, who heard of the in
tended murder, told the British Consul that the man
was a British subject, that officer went at once to
the Chilean commander and demanded the man's re
lease, threatening that if this was not instantly done
the British warships in the harbor would bombard
the town. The prisoner was immediately set free,
though the firing squad was already in place to mur
der him.
TAMPERING WITH DISPATCHES.
An innocent, law-abiding horse of Salinas saw an
automobile the otherday, shivered, and dropped dead
on the spot. Even he who runs must admit without
discussion that the animal died from natural causes.
Nor have the achievements of the Californias been
confined to the attainment of material good. We
have already furnished many a brilliant name to the
lists of scientists, poets, painters, singers, sculptors,
musicians and orators whom the world honors. In
short, the profuse fertility of the State has been al
most as notable in the domain of the intellect as in.
that of the production of fruits and of gold.
A commonwealth so rich in resources, so genial in
climate, so romantic and so honorable in her history,
merits the patriotic love with which her people,
whether native or adopted, regard her. Her festival
day falls at a season of the year when everything of
earth and sky can be counted on to contribute to
the sum of human enjoyment. It is then no wonder
that the observation of the day becomes more and
more general as the years pass, and that each suc
ceeding celebration exceeds its predecessor in the fer
vor of popular enthusiasm and in the brilliancy of
Us ceremonial decorations and parades.
The story thus told is one of the most interesting
in the annals of mankind. Beginning as a tale of ad
venture on the part of the cavaliers and freebooters
of Spain and of England, exemplified in the roman
tic personalities of Cabrillo and Drake, it is soon
transformed into a story of missionary zeal, telling
of the labors of Junipero Serra and his colleagues;
then slowly changes into an idyll of pastoral life
whose continuity is rudely broken first by revolution
and then by a magic working discovery of gold that
brings the restless foot of American enterprise to
the land and begins an era that changes every ex
isting institution and creates a virtuaUy new com
monwealth.
With the change in the nature of its civilization a
change comes over the story of the State, but it re
mains as interesting as ever. In place of the old
records of adventurers, missionaries and lordly
rancheros we have now the story of gold hunters,
miners, merchants, railroad builders, founders of
schools, churches and universities â men of every
class and grade of the pioneer type. The story of the
work of those men and of their sons constitutes
the world's greatest historic romance of modqrn
times. In no other part of the world, among any
thing like so limited a population, has there been
done so much during the last fifty years to advance
human welfare. We have carried the industries of
; mining and of horticulture to a perfection unknown
; elsewhere. Our ship-builders have established them
selves among the foremost of the age. In the appli
cation of electric energy to the needs of industry,
not only in cities but in rural districts, we lead the
van of progress, and in many another department of
industry we hold rank among the foremost.
Comprehensive as it is, the story of the State' thus
presented can be easily read during the leisure hours
of the holiday, for it is tersely told. No effort has
been made to publish a voluminous supplement more
notable for its many pages than for any other merit.
On the contrary, the aim in preparing this record
of the State has been to give the facts compactly
in good literary style, illustrated with portraits of
distinguished men, sketches of interesting places and
incidents, and symbolic cartoons of "California up
to-date" and of her native Muses â Art, Literature
and Music.
CALIFORNIA'S State festival will probably, be
to-day more generally celebrated than ever
before in her history. It is of course nat
ural that it should be so, for with each succeeding
year the influence of the Native Sons and Daughters
augments, and with that influence there develops an
increasing popular pride in the greatness of the State,
its romantic history and its glorious future. It is
inevitable that such feelings of patriotic regard for
the commonwealth should prompt a public manifes
tation, and accordingly in well nigh every section of
the State there will be this year a notable celebration
of the day that marked the admission of the com
monwealth as a State in the Union.
By way of contributing to the observance of the
day The Call presents this morning a supplement
containing a compendium of the history of Califor
nia, set forth both in letters and in pictures. The
supplement is by all odds the most comprehensive
and instructive ever published on the subject of Cali
fornia's history, industries, resources and prospects,
while a special page is devoted to San Francisco â
the golden city of the modern world, the Bagdad of
the West.

So vanish all the bugaboo fears that the law
would be a disturbance of trade and ineffectual as
a remedy against the evils complained of. Expe
rience has shown that the bare announcement of the
law/ accompanied by a clearly manifest intent to
strictly enforce it, has brought about a suspension of
the injurious imports. The result has naturally
enough given. encouragement to the advocates of the
adoption of a domestic pure food law, and it is not
unlikely it may be provided at the coming session of
Congress.

I New Pope's Sister Prophesies Evil 1
1 for His Holiness.s5=- 1
8 "Oh, what a misfortune! My poor Beppo, who so loved a comfort- S
S able chat! Who knows what misery he will go through in that prisdta Â§
8 there in Rome?" o
p These were the words, said with tears and real grief, with which S
gj Maria, sister of Pius X. received the news that he had been made Pope. Â«
8 and they epitomize the feeling of the family about this elevation of their S
g "Beppo" to one of the most powerful positions on earth.
S Of course it is not an unusual circumstance, that in all times and 9
Â« all ages evil prophecies of dire disaster to come have been heaped Â§
o upon the heads of those who have won greatness, but in this instance o
3 the above incident, with much more that has followed since then, has Â§
v* electrified and well nijih appalled many of those who are in a position Â»
8 to know the condition of affairs at the Vatican. Â§
jxj Indeed, it is extraordinary when one's own family prophesy evil <5
Â« where only good can be. but yet, strange as it may seem, not only the Â§
8 sister 'of the new Pope, but her brother and many of the other mem* Â§
S bers of the family besides have given utterance to words that have g
8 added vastly to the mystery of the misery and growing unhappincss that 5
S is said to be settling heavily upon His Holiness. Strangest of all, they
D speak authoritatively, without malice, but in deepest compassion, and <3
S their words are being given credence far and wide, more particularly as '<>
K Pius X has been adding equally strange confirmation. v
S He speaks continuously of the many things in his life that he had 5?

The gardener in Portsmouth Square
found a satchel yesterday morning and
took it to police headquarters, where it
waa opened. It contained a complete out
fit for a counterfeiter, including brass
mold, imitation gold dust, chemicals and
other articles. It is, supposed that the
owner had fallen asleep in the square
and had left after waking, up, forgetting
about his satchel.

The police are still searching for a mo
tive and before the preliminary hearing
startling developments on that point may
take place. Patrick Lervey, who is sup
posed to be Identified with the motive,
has become taciturn and refuses to make
any further statements. He says he has
talked too much already and has been
advised to keep a still tongue.
After the arraignment District Attorney
Byington made a formal request for a
continuance till Monday. It was granted
with the reluctant consent of Attorneys
Drury and Low.
The Judge said that his calendar was
congested and he could not take up the
case before Monday. If the defendants
Insisted upon their rights he would con
tinue the case till to-morrow, so as to
hear a little of the evidence. This would
put defendants to the inconvenience of
being brought into court.
Attorney Drury asked that the defend
ants be instructed and arraigned. Mrs.
Sutton listened Intently to the reading
of the complaint by Clerk Fenton as she
stood beside him, but Mrs. Bowers ap
peared indifferent, and when asked her
true name ohe did not hear the clerk and
had to be prompted by her attorney. The
two tall women, dressed in mourning,
made a striking appearance as they stood
together during tho arraignment. '
When the case was called the Judge
said he had been notified by the Coro
ner's stenographer that the testimony
taken at the inquest last Saturday could
not be transcribed before Monday, and
he suggested, in view of that fact, that
the matter be continued till that day.
Attorney Frank Drury, who appeared
with Attorney Charles A. Low for the
defendants, asked for a speedy trial. The
defendants, he said, had been confined in
the City Prison for about two weeks and
they were now entitled to have the case
set for as early a date aa possible. They
were ready to proceed and he saw no
reason why any delay should be granted
because the Coroner's stenographer did
not have the testimony taken at the in
quest transcribed.
Mrs. Martha E. Bowers and her sister,
Mrs. Zylpha Sutton, were arraigned In
Police Judge Cabanlss' court yesterday
morning on the charge of murder and the
preliminary hearing was set for next
Monday afternoon at 2 o'clock. They are
Jointly accused of administering arsenic
to Martin L. Bowers, husband of Mrs.
Bowers, thereby causing his death.

there was not 'even standing room.
They were justified in their disappoint
ment, for the performance was one that
lacked nothing in the way of interest and
entertainment, a fact for which specta
tors frequently showed their appreciation
in bursts of applause. The animal fea
ture of the performanace was excellent
and one that reflects full credit upon the
managers of the ' circus. Particularly
does this apply to the trained horses and
the wonderful herd of elephants, which
are In themselves features worthy of the
greatest praise.
Proprietor Fischer wished the ycung
girls every kind of good fortune when
talking last night of their going. Miss
Levey and Miss Purdy will depart fiom
this city in about two weeks and will re
hearse with the Weber arid Fields com
pany immediately upon their arrival in
New York.
Speaking of the engagement. Samuel
Frledlander, manager of Fischer's Thea
ter, said:
Both Miss Levey and Miss Purdy have been
with us since the opening: of the house. They
have proved themselves efficient, painstaking
and clever, both in the chorus and as dancers.
Their going under epeclal engagement to Weber
& Fields Theater 1b a compliment not alone
to themselves, but, I think, also to this houae.
It Is a compliment to the company and we ap
preciate the engagement, while at the same
time wo are thoroughly sorry to have to part
with the young ladle*.
Miss Levey and Miss Purdy are elated
with tRe prospect of a New York ap
pearance, but feel a pang of regret as the
time grows near when they must leave
their old associates at the O'Farrell
street home of burlesque.
The engagement lor New York of the
two fair California choristers and danc
ers is but another proof that even in the
more humble ranks of the theatrical pro
fi'wlon here there is talent of a high de

WOMEN DEMAND
SPEEDY TRIAL
â¢Had Ringling Brothers added ten tiers
of seats to their canvas covered amphi
theater last -night the additional accom
modations would not have been ample to
meet the requirements of the San Fran
cisco public that clamored for admission
to the show. Thousands who had failed
to secure seats during the early part
of the day were last evening turned
away at the entrance of the big tents
with the disappointing information that
The cages containing the lions, the
bears, the tigers, the camels and every
other known specimen of terrible beast,
all passed up before the crowd for In
spection. Kach vicious animal was chap
eroned by his trainer and small boys
gave vent to their admiration for the
man by the animal as the parade jour
neyed on.
The j procession took,, nearly half an
hour to pass and the crowd enjoyed
every minute of the time. A circus pa
rade always arouses interest wherever it
goes, and It is bound to attract attention,
but it can safely be said that the Ring
ling parade is the most imposing ever
seen here.
The street was lined with people long
before the parade appeared. As usual,
every one wanted to get right in the
front line, and the policemen were sweat
ing 1 for a while as they wrestled with the
eager youth and the nervous citizen in
the crowding throng.
After a while, when the mob began to
get tired, a little music was heard in the
distance, and around the corner from
Kearny street a bunch of ladies attired
In red coats and mounted on steeds of
the real fiery order hove in sight, and
then the big thing was at last a reality.
These striking-looking -horsewomen were
followed, as usual, by one of the bands.
It struck up a merry tune as soon as the
corner was rounded and then everybody
got ready.
It was probably the best circus parade
that ever passed up Market street. There
was everything that goes to make a
street, procession the only thing in the
town while it passes up the chief street.
There was no hitch or. delay, and the
army of human beings and wild animals
and other attaches went up the line to
get the glad salute and the joyous yell
from the multitude. ,
As the lions and the elephants and the
snake charmers and the brass bands and
the steam calliope and the thousand and
one other things that tyjfo included in the
make-up of the Ringlfng Circus passed
up Market street in an unbroken lino
yesterday morning they were received
with cheers from the adult population
and cries of delight from the youngsters
who were there to welcome the turnout.

While in a melancholy mood caused by
a quarrel with her husband. Mrs. Minnie
During, the wife of Herman During, an
employe at the ferry postoffice, com
mitted suicide yesterday morning at her
home, 1512 Leavenworth street, by lnhal-
Ir.g Illuminating gas.
The unfortunate -woman, who was 33
years old, was married about 18 years ago
and she sought death garbed in the
white gown with which she had arrayed
herself when she became a wife. The
bridal veil, white gloves and handker
chief also formed a portion of the robes
of death.
The causes that prompted Mrs. During
to end her life were of a trivial nature.
During returned to his home on Monday
evening at a later hour than he was ex
pected and the husband and wife had
angry words. After eating dinner. Dur
ing informed his wife that he intended
to keep an engagement to attend a card
party. A second quarrel followed and
During left the house. His wife followed
him and a third quarrel eneued on the
Etreets, which was ended by During es
corting his wife home.
Th husband then went out and after
playing cards with some friends came
home at midnight. He did not find his
v.ife in the rooms they occupied and eee
lng that a pillow and two blankets were
missing from the bed, he presumed that
t nt" was sleeping in another apartment.
Yesterday morning During arose at 6
o'clock and proceeded to his work. He
did not search for his wife, as he was
f.f the opinion that she waa either In an
other room or had spent the night with
Eome friends.
About 8, a little girl living in the house
detected the odor of gas ar.d Informed
her mother, who occupied apartments on
the lower floor. A neighbor was called
in and the escaping gas was traced to
a small room in the rear of the apart
ments of the Durlngs. The door was
locked on the inside and when it was
troken open Mrs. During was found lying
rold in death. She had taken four chairs
and a basket trunk and made a tempor
ary resting place, over which she had
j-pread two blankets and a pillow. She
haul removed her wedding ring from her
linger and placed it upon a bureau and
after turning on the gas had laid down
:n the improvised bed and calmly went
to her end.
The dÂ« ath of Mrs. During waa carefully
investigated by Deputy Coroner McCor
mick and Detective Harry Reynolds, and
both officers scouted the theory of foul
play which gained rumor in the vicinity
of the During home. When During was
informed of his wife's tragic act. he was
detracted by grief and bitterly lamented
that he had had angry words with his
wife.
An autopsy hrld by Dr. Bacigalupl
showed that Mrs. During*s death was
caused by carben monoxide poisoning,
following the inhalation of Illuminating

The California Debris Commission, com

Heuer and Captain Harts, met yesterday
and adjusted the differences between the
land owners and the dredging: people.
These differences concern the proposed
improvement of the Tuba River at
Daguerre Point, twelve miles east of
Marysville, f Qr which the Government
and the State have Jointly appropriated
$300,000. It is proposed to build two bar
riers above Daguerre Point for the pur
pose of holding back the coarse mining
tailings and to make a cut at the Point
so as to carry the Yuba River out to one
side and away from the tailings lying in
the stream. They are now being washed
down into the Feather and . Sacramento
rivers to the detriment of navigation.
After the Government had agreed to
purchase title to the lar.il Involved It was
discovered that part of the Â»and was val

The Cripples hooked up with Parke

terday afternoon on the Oakland field for
the first time in many moons arid for
th^lr trouble they were handed the de
feat package. At that they had the game
won for a time, but the men of the north
Flipped it to them In the shape of three
runs in the sixth inning after two were
out. and that about settled it. Score:
Seattle i, Oakland 3.
The Seattle team has been greatly
changed sir.co it appeared here the last
time. It includes the groat Kid Mohler.
Jimmy St. Vraln. Jay Andrews, Joe Mc-
Carthy. 13111 Byers and Brashear.
Jay Hughes, on the Seattle slab, had
everything. In all inninsrs but one he
blanked the Cripples. Then they landed
on him for a nunch of five hits, three
of which were scratchy. This gave them
three runs and a good lead and it looked
for a time as though they would get
away with the battle. The northerners
were there strong^" In the eixth. With
two trone, Brashear was given a pass Â£jnd
rolled in on a three-bagger by Zlnssar.
The latter came home when Jans'nr hit
safely to short center field. )
This seemed to lake all the fight out of
the Cripples, as after that they were
never in the game. While they were
making their little rally in the fifth in
ning Buck Francks tried to score from
peccuid on Moskiman's hit. Levy called
him out # and then the Oakland players
started a rough house. Lohman was put

He was very much taken with Tuna
and concluded to buy her. Mr. do la Mon-
Tuna, the speedy little mare which won
the Stanford stake at Sacramento on
Monday, is the property of James de la
Montanya of this city. She was pur
chased by him a few days, ago for the
express purpose of winning the stake.
She was formerly the property of Henry
Sanders, a brother of Millard Sanders,
trainer of Lou Dillon. 2:00, and was bred
at the Oakwood Stock Fat'm.
Mr. de la Montanya is one of the best
known horse fanciers in this city and has
a big stable. Some time ago he purchased
Bromwell, a fast filly sired by Sidney
Dillon. Bromwell, however; did not show
as well as Mr. de la Montanya expected,
so he immediately began to look around
for another horse which would have a
better chance of winning the Stanford
stake.

Which Wins the Stanford Staked.
Henry V. Tulloch, a brother of Seymour
Tulloch, cashier of the Washington post
offlce, who was the first to make charges
that resulted in the present scandals, in
the postofflce department and Wallace D.
McLean, son of the Government archi
tect, are among the latest arrivals at the
Palace. They are interested in mining
enterprises in the West. Tulloch predicts
that there will be another outbreak in
the postofflce scandal when Congress
meets, for he expects that the Democrats
will revive It for political purposes, and
a merry time will ensue. His brother
lately has been visiting Mexico, where
tiie members of the family are interested
in the Mitchell properties.
McLean is the secretary of the Sons of
the American Revolution, an organiza

TROTTING AND PACING
AT CHARTER OAK PARK
Harry Stover's Illowaho, at odds of 3
to 5, made a gallop of the mile selling
number.. See, who had the mount, wait
ed on Anvil and Cambaceres, and then,
cutting lose in the run home, won under
restraint in 1:40%. Cambaceres finished
third, less than a length behind Anvil.
In the closing sprint Teufel, Elfin King
and Myrtle H were all held at 2 to 1 in
the. books. After Elfin King had made
all- the running Frawley, on Teuful,
moved out of the king row, getting a
neck decision. F. E. MUL.HOLL.AND.
Royal F, See up, went to the post fa
vorite for the first running event, a five
furlong scramble. See waited with the
sturdy little horse until well into the
stretch, where he went %o the front with
his mount, beating the big bush horse,
Hercules, cleverly In 1:00%. Skirmish ran
into the show.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 8.-Another
warm spell made no appreciable
decrease In the attendance this
afternoon at Agricultural Park.
The sport, while interesting, was
marked by nothing of the sensational or
der. If Dlvina and Kenilworth meÂ»t on
Thursday a record-breaking-crowd may
be looked for. Of the six harness and
running events decided to-day favorites
were returned first on five occasions.
The Bella Vista stake, valued at $525,
for two-year-old fillies at five furlongs,
was the feature. Six young misses faced
the barrier, with Annie Marie, the mount
of Frawley, enjoying first call In the bet
ting. Frawley's usual eagerness to beat
the others away contributed to the first
choice's defeat. At the start, which was
accomplished after some delay, Frawley
carried the rubber barrier with him and
it dangled about his mount's legs
throughout. Wiggins, one of the second
choices, came fast at the end, winning
with ease from the tiring Annie Marie.
Metlakatla was away poorly and, ran un
placed.
As Candy Joe. whose destinies^ were
presided over by Harry Bell, had quite as
good a thing of it as Jeffries will enjoy
with Monroe, the Drummers' race was
deprived of alMnterest. Kverybody was
sweet on the horse and the Sacramento
contingent, which can hear a good thing
walking over the tule trestle beiow the
whistling post, unloaded on Joe, which
sold a 10 to 5 favorite over the field He
won in two straight heats.
John Carlln, behind the handsome Ro
sle Woodburn, took the 2:30 class trot.
The mare was a pronounced favorite in
the pooling. She scared her backers by
finishing third to Louise Croner irnd Ju
piter B in the first heat. She had no rec
ords to break through, and made away
with the next three heats without en
countering any squally weather or ad
verse tide.
tanya is elated over the success' of Tuna,
which he expects to do great things on
the track this season.
Suspends Administratrix.
Mrs. H. F. Lewis, widow of the late C
A. Kelly and administratrix of his estate,
.was suspended yesterday by Judge Cof
fey. pending an investigation into her
methods of handling the estate. A charge
of carelessness in handling the funds
was preferred against her by F. J. Kane.
Sues Accuser for Damages.
A suit for $23,000 damages for false Im
prisonment was filed yesterday by F H
Hausman against J. H. Sayre. The plain
tiff was acquitted on a charge of cm
brtpzling $1215 frÂ«m. the National Fertil
izer Company, preferred against 'him last
March by Sayre. :
MINNEAPpLIS. Sept. 8.-The building
strike came to an end to-day, work boinÂ« rÂ«-
Schlam returned to the city on a visit
a few days ago and last Saturday Ronco
vieri met him and demanded the return
of the sheets, but Schlam Refused to give
them up. Roncovieri alleges that Schlam
is about to leave the State for New York
and he wants .him arrested.
It is alleged by Roncovieri that about
two years ago Schlam received from him
forty-one sheets of manuscript of his
march "Pro Patria," and when Schlam
left for New York he took the sheets
with him. Roncovieri values them at
$230.
Alfred Roncovieri, school director and
musician, is after the scalp of Hugo V.
Schlam, a music dealer, formerly of this
city, but now of New York. Yesterday
afternoon Roncovieri secured a^warrant
from Police Judge Mogan for BchlanVa

deared Blatz beer to lovers of
the. beverage fifty years ago has
been maintained to this day.
While the facilities have been
vastly improved Blatz prin-

TRADES UNION CONOBZSS.
Declares Against Suggested Changes
in British Fiscal Policy.
LEICESTER, England, Sept. 8.â At to
day's session of the Trades Union Con
gress President Hornbridge declared Co
lonial Secretary Chamberlain's suggested
changes in the British fiscal policy were
likely to be most detrimental to the Tbest
Interests of the nation.
"Dabbling with the principles of free
trade," he. asserted, "could do no good to
the country at present. The land laws
caused two-thirds of the national mis
ery."
He advocated Government old-age pen
sions.
The following resolution was carried
with only two dissenting votes:
That this congress stroncly condemns the
suggested changes by Mr. Chamberlain In our
present fiscal policy aa most mischievous and
dangerous to the best interests of the people
of the country, and hereby pledges Itself and
urges all other labor bodies to make every
effort to prevent such a change being brought
about.
The announcement of the vote was
greeted with loud cheers. The resolution
will be communicated to the Colonial
Secretary.
After a heated discussion an Important
resolution on labor was passed. The res
olution commits the Labor party to sup
porting neither of the dominant political
parties and has Increased the strained
relations with the Liberals.

The petition states that there has been
a petition .of 10 per cent or the bona fide
residents of the. city presented to the
Board of Trustees asking, in accordance
with the ordinance No. 270, that the prop
osition of granting the franchises be sub
mitted to a vote of the people. This they
claim will not be done unless the court
take action in the matter, and the case
was set by. Judge Hall to be heard be
fore Judge Greene on October 2.
Acting on an opinion rendered by City
Attorney M. W. Simpson, who held that
the 'referendum ordinance was invalid
the Alameda City Trustees by a voto of
four to one decided to-night to instruct
the City Attorney to go into court and
invalidate the ordinance if possible
President J. F. Forderer of the munici
pal legislators was not in 'favor of lest-'
Ing the question whether the referendum
enactment was legal or mandatory, being
satisfied to allow the voters an opportu
nity to pass on the matter of the dispo
sition of the franchises before final ac
tion Is taken by the Alameda governing
board. City Trustees "Charles J. Ham
mond and ( B. E. Combs, who were gen
erally belle\ed to be willing to submit
the franchise question to the voters
created surprise by voting to have a
flght made against the legality of the
referendum. City Trustees Ir. H. M
Pond and W. M. Bowers voted with
them. To avoid any possibility of being
in contempt of court tho City Trustees
agreed not to touch upon the matter of
the franchises In any way until the Su
perior Court 'has disposed of: the writ of
mandate proceedings. -
H. Rosenthal, H. A. Thompson, J. K.
Houck and T. F. Baird, through their
attorney, Thomas K. Kase f were to-day
granted an alternative writ of mandate
by Judge Hall. It commands Joseph F.
Forderer. H. M. Pond, C. J. Hammond,
B. C. Combs and William M. Bowers,
constituting the Board of Trustees, to
appear before Judge Greene on October
2 and show cause why they should not
submit the proposition of granting the
franchises petitioned for to the popular
vote of the people.
Their petition recites that unless re
strained the Board of Trustees will grant
the franchises in violation of an ordinance
passed by a Board of Trustee's in March
1895, known as ordinance No. 270, which
states that "whenever 10 per cent of the
legal voters of the city of Alameda shall
petition in writing therefor the Board of
Trustees shall submit to said voters 3uch
proposition of local interest as may be
specified In said petition, said submission
to be made for the purpose of enabling the
said voters to express their approval or
disapproval of the question to be voted
upon."
Those citizens of Alameda that oppose
the Southern Pacific Company's demands
for a fifty-year franchise have carried
their cause to the courts. They would
have the City Trustees enjoined from
granting away their rlahts.

about the time the sham battle was con
cluded the grandstand broke down.
There was a heavy artillery duel â¢ with
siege guns. Three battalions of infantry
were using black powder and some one
announced that the cavalry were emerg
ing from a ravine to charge. People on
the grandstand stood up to see them
through the smoke and the entire stand
went down with/ a crash. The utmost
confusion followed, accompanied by
shrieks of the victims. It was found that
many were pinned down under the de
bris. Hundreds who were walking on the
ground rushed to the grandstand look-
Ing for relatives. The confusion was great
until the regular soldiers formed a line
and kept all back.
The battle which was proceeding on the
other side of the road was called off and
the soldiers began taking care of the In
jured. Ambulances were used to convey
the people to the city hospitals and within
an hour after the accident the injured
had been removed.

The prosecution's main case against
Victor Walkirez ended to-day with the
testimony of Anna Ross, the chief wit

certain records which showed that Walki

The woman was on the stand most of
the day and the court room was crowded
by people anxious to hear her recital of
the crime. Her evidence in the main was
much the same as her original confes

from her on cross examination that
Walkirez had been drinking heavily the
Hlj the murder was committed and also
that he had told her the next morning:
that he did not remembtr committing the
crime, and that she had thereupon re

"But a man has Just been here and
fixed the phone," explained Mr. Backus.
"Oh, I know that," replied the caller,
"but I am an inspector for the company
and must pass upon the work done."
Upon that showing tne caller was ad
mitted. He worked about the box for
a short time and then left the house.
Shortly afterward the phone failed to
work and word J was again sent to the
company. Another repairer reported and
he found the cut wire. Backus believes
that the wire cutter had been trailing
the first workman and followed him up
to get a chance to do his mischief.
In the guiso of an Inspector for the tele
phone company a man gained entrance to
the residence of Oscar J. Backus on Linda
Vista terrace a day or so ago, was given
access to the telephone and deliberately
cut the inside wires in such a way as to
put the instrument completely out of ser
vice. The stranger, yet to be Identified,
did his work with evident thorough
knowledge of the apparatus. Detectives
are trying to locate the mischief maker.
Telephone company officials say that
numerous complaints of Bimilar actions
have been received since the company
put linemen and repair men at work to
take the daces of strikers.
In the Backus case the circumstances
point to deliberate effort to Injure and
destroy use of telephones. The phone at
the residence had been out of order and
a complaint was sent to the telephone
company's offices. From there an em
ploye went to the house and regulated
the telephone putting it In working con
dition. Shortly after this employe de
parted another man called at the house
and announced that he desired to exam
ine the phone.

Left alone In the saloon, the robber ran
behind the bar, emptied the cash regis
ter, taking $24 35. and quickly left by the
elde door. He ran up Adeline street and
turned west on Eighth. Near Magnolia
6treet the fugitive disappeared In a back
yard. Soon afterward three policemen ar
rived, but after searching the neighbor
hood, got no trace of the bold robber.
Welander described the man as tall, at
least six feet In height, and wearing a
dark suit of clothes. He had a fair
glimpse of that part of the intruder's
face that was not covered by the hand
kerchief.
Unable to make headway against his
caller, Welander quit and ran through the
front of the store and out to Seventh
street, shouting for assistance.
The encounter occurred at 8:30 o'clock.
Welander wae in the front part of his
place of business, which is separated
from the barroom by "a partition. In
which a doorway Is cut. He heard the
squeaking of the Adeline-street door that
gives entrance to the barroom and went
back to wait on his prospective customer.
As Welander stepped into the apartment
he almost walked over tho robber, who
stood. at the end of the bar, masked be
low the eyes with a white handkerchief
tied about his face, and carrying a pistol
that he aimed straight at the proprietor.
Welander, startled as he was, did not
lose presence of mind. He jumped at his
unwelcome guest and grabbed the pistol,
trying to wrench It from the robber's
hands. There was a hard struggle for the
weapon. During the fight a cartridge ex
ploded, the bullet whizing so close to
Welander's head that it almost stunned
him.
In a battle to-night with a ma*ked rob
ber, A. N. Welander, liquor-dealer, north
west corner of Seventh and Adeline
streets, narrov.-ly escaped being- killed
at his place of business by a bullet from
a pistol for the possession of which the
saloon man and the masked intruder
fought.
Unable to cope with the desperado, We
lander ran out of the place, calling for
assistance. As soon as he departed, the
robber coolly helped himself to the coin
In the barroom till, $24 35, and fled. He
was traced as far as Eighth and Magno
lia streets, where his trail was lost In a
back yard.

Both Watertoy and McChesney have de
clined the issue In the Omnium handicap
to be run to-morrow, in spite of the ex
tra inducements "offered by the Coney
Island Jockey Club. Their owners and.
trainers considered that 131 pounds was
too much weight for thsm to shoulder.
But they probably will come together at
Gravesend next Monday, weight for age,
for one mile and a quarter.
In this race the two champions will pack
126 pounds each, and as an incentive the>
Brooklyn Jockey Club has agreed to give
J25OO to the winner if both start. Aa thÂ«
added money is $2500, the race will bo
worth entering. .;. >
Owing to the successive victories of
Western horses here in the past few
days. Western turfmen who are follow
ing the local races are fairly rolling in
clover. There was not a man from the
Central States who did not have a wager
on McChesney when he beat Hermla'and
other good ones on Monday, and they re
peated their bombardment when The
Picket wen to-day. It is hard to con
vince a metropolitan bookmaker that the
Eastern turf heroes mjght be inferior to
the cracks that come out of the West,
and the result Is that the backers of the
Western horses always get a price. If
Waterboy and McChesney meet on Mon
day, the betting will be tho heaviest
ever seen on an American track, and the
local horse will again be the favorite.
CHICAGO, Sept. 8.â Metropolitan layers
of odds have learned to respect E. E.
Smathers, the owner of McChesney, who
won jr.0,000 from them on Monday. Sma
thers made things hum in the betting ring
at Sheepshead Bay again to-day. He
plunged on his mare, Irene Lindsey, in
the second race, betting, it Is said, $2),0QQ
on her at 8 to 3. Then he went right back
to The Picket, placing a similar amount
on the American Derby winner at 6 to 5.
In addition Smathers, John A. Drake
and John W. Gates sent commissions into
the ring on both of these horses that
jarred the pencilera to their heels. The
trio took nearly $100,000 out of the ring on
the second race.

witness, said that the shot which killed
Brown was not fired by- Godat, but by a
person In the crowd and , behind the de
cea&ed. Godat and Brown were facing
each, other when they exchanged shots.
Godat's pistol cannot be found. Neither
of tho two bullets h'e fired lodged in
Brown's body, but they made flesh
wounds. The fatal bullet was from a 41
caliber pistol.' 'â¢
Oho theory advanced is that after Brown
shot Godat Mrs. Godat shot him from be
hind and .then secured Godat's pistol. This
seems unreasonable, . however, as Brown
andMra. Brown and Mrs. Godat were to
gether all day and Mrs. Godat's friendly
relations with Brown were really at the
bottom of the tragedy. Yet it is learned
that District Attorney Dedrlck has in his
possession, a' letter given him by Godat
in which Brown said he would kill Godat
on sight.. Mrs. Brown herself testified
that her husband fired first. .
Â¦ The tragedy was the ending of an other
wise grand Labor day celebration given
by the Miners' and Lumbermen's unions,
and occurred while a big drilling contest
was in progress. Godat wa3 formerly
president of the Miners''' Union In this
county, but arrived from Arizona only
this week. It is reported that he tele
phoned from Sonora to his wife asking
her to mnke up with him, but that she
hung up the phone when she learned who
was calling. Mrs. Brown says Godat told
her on the day of the tragedy that he
was going to try and smooth things over
with Brown.
GRAPPLES WITH
MASKED ROBBER
The defendants. William and Georgo
Pullen. are entitled to one-fifth of the
property transferred to George, who will
be charged with the Quivey ranch, lot
4 of the Bascom tract, several notes of
the value of nearly $30,000; he will also be
charged with all the costs of the action.
George Y. Bollinger was formerly Sheriff
of Santa Clara County.
The evidence, according to ihe court,
sustains the conclusion that George urged
his father to transfer to him a large
amount of property in trust to defeat any
claim plaintiff might make thereto, to
manage and invest tha property pru
dently, and to hold it In trust, paying his
father such sums as he might require
for his comfort; and in case of the plain
tiff's death to transfer all the property
to the fattter, or In case of the father's
death to transfer it all, share and share
alike, to the children.
The court scores the defendant for his
disregard of business principles In man
aprlng this property, and declares that he
does not own the property, but simply
hold? It In trust; on the other hand, the
plaintiff has no interest in it whatever,
it having been separate property of the
husband, and she Is not entitled to judg
ment.
On October 15, 1K?S. the widow filed a
t-otiticn contesting the will, the heirs
being the widow and the children. George.
David, Klizabeth C. and Kmma Eare, and
Mary C. Pullen, who d:c-d In 1S93, and
whose children, \VIiilam and George, were
appointed executors of her estate.
SAN JOSE. Sept. 8.â Judge Ilyland to
day filed his decision in the suit cf Mary
A. L. Bollinger vs. George Y. Bo'.llnger
ot al., for the recovery of property of
the late Christian Bolllnger. valued at
$100,000. Bolllnger died January 26, 1858, and
upon his death his son, Gecrge Y.
Bollinger, was appointed executor of the
estate. The plaintiff, who is the widow,
was married to Christian Bollinger No
vember 7, 1Â£SO, and both had separate
property, which they retained separately
and there was no community property
uecunmlatecl after their marriage.
Now, Jake Rlis could never have been of
any use in the Police Department if he had
always carried on a rosewater revolution. Un
less a man has the stuff In him the fact that
he Is a decent fellow does not , count. If hÂ«*
is. not decent then the stronger he is the
worse he La as a citizen. I want to say how
deeply touched I am at your coming out to
greet me, and I want you to understand that
you give me strength of heart when you come
in this way. I greet you all. I am glad to
see ihe grown-up people of Richmond Hill, and
I am even more glad to see the children.
(Cheers and applause.)
NEW YORK, Sept. 8.â President Roose
velt arrived at the Hoboken station of
the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western
Railroad at 7:15 a, m. to-day on the spe
cial train which left Syracuse last night.
When proceeding to board the tug Scran
ton he was' heartily che%red by a crowd
in the ferry house 1 and on a departing
ferryboat. He was evidently pleased
with his reception, shouting, "Good
luck! Good luck! Thank you for your
greeting!" The tug proceeded to Long
Island City to place the President on the
train for Oyster Bay. )
When the special train reached Rich
mond Hill all the Sunday-school children
of the villages, each carrying an. Ameri
can flag; representatives of the Twenti
eth Century Club and the Richmond Hill
Republican Club and a big gathering of
townspeople joined in a welcome to the
President. Flags, hats and handkerchiefs
were waved and the enthusiasm was tre
mendous.
The President and Jacob Rlis appeared
on ,the rear platform of the last car,
where Riis bade good-by to the President
and then alighted from the car. Dr.
Kimball. president of the Twentieth Cen
tury Club, made a short speech of wel
come to the President.
President Roosevelt responded as fol
lows:
Dr. Kimball and you men and children of
Richmond Hill: I wish I could talk better to
all of you, but I will aFk you to have a little
patience for one moment while I thank you
for having come out to greet me. I am glad
to see all of you, ,and allow me to aay that I
am most Rlad to see those who carry small
folks in their arms. (Laughter and applause.)
You know, I am very fond of Mr. Rlis, and
the reason why is because when I preach
about decent citizenship I can turn to him and
think that he has practiced Just what I have
been preaching:. (Applause.)
The worth of any sermon lies in the way in
which that sermon can be and 13 applied In
practice. Of course, I am glad to have the
chance of being with a man who shows by his
life that he knows how practically to apply
the spirit of decency unaccompanied by mourn
fulness or false pretenses of any kind, or any
weakness. I want to Bee men decent; I want
to see them act square; I want to see them
work. That does not mean I want them to
have sour faces. I want to see every one en-
Joy themselves, men, women and children. I
believe in play; I believe In happiness and In
the 4 Â«v- of llvlnsr, but I do not believe in the
life that is nothing but play. I believe that
you have a thousandfold more enjoyment If
work comes first, but make your time to play
also. I believe in cheerfulness, as well as In
decency and honesty. And In the next place.
I btlleve in a Rood man who can. fight If it la
necessary. (Applause.) As you fought In the
Civil War.
The "New World." of Dvorak's, was the
day's cymphony. Very well It went, too.
though at times one would have liked
a dash cf the Mascagni glitter about the
reading. -Not In the nrst two movements,
however, that went swingingly. The An
eiante in particular satisJied. Its quaint
phrase. Afro-Polish, came with ripe sym
pathy for Its characteristic color and with
nicest precision. Here, perhaps, more
than In any other number, the thing
played itself. Dvorak himself, in the lat
ter part of the symphony, gets monoton
ous. There is a spreading out of his ma
terial, a thinning and graying of the
color. Still, one felt that the flame-tipped
Mascagni baton would have been useful
here, however Scheel soars In the XJee
thoven and Handel genre.
Berlioz' "Dance of the Sylphs" was
another novelty of the afternoon. This
elusive morsel, with Its mystery and
moonshine, the pipes o' Pan and white
twink!e of elfin feet, was delightfully
given. The dance did not quite attain Its
fullest delicacy, but that Is only in the
gift of an orchestra of long established
relations. Extraordinary, though, was
the degree of lightness obtained. New,
also, was the "Ancients and Moderns"
mazurka cf Godard. It was not, however,
important, a graceful enough and obvious
trifle. The massive "Kaiser March" of
Wagner, played in a stately manner, and
the -"Mignon" overture completed the ex
cellent programme.
The applause and attendance were
again of most- encouraging sort. The
Dvorak andante, after the Handel,
aroused the listeners to the greatest audi
ble aCmlration. The Handel throughout
was joyously greeted and the Berlioz had
to be repeated. The whole concert again
showed a quick and wonderful growth of
the ensemble spirit in the orchestra.
Next week there is to be the Brahms
pymphony No. 2, the "Midsummer Night's
Dream," and appropriately in accord with
the coming "Parsifal" of New Yorkâ
alas! no nearer â some of the Parsifal
isufIc will be given-
Sparafucile was much better taken care !
of than the role commonly is by Eignor i
Travaglir.?, whose pleasant bass was
finely used in its service. Cleo Marche-
E!nl satisfied handsomely in the Madda
leu role, and Miss Deglow deserves re
membrance for her promising work.
The male chorus was exceptionally
good, and the orchestra, though it sagged
somewhat in sympathy with the "Tutti
Ic festi" duetto, and needed generally a
little more plastic mind, was yet agree
ably in evidence. To-night "Faust" goes
again.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The pern of yesterday afternoon's
symphony programme was Master Han-j
dels Grand Concerto, played here for the
first time yesterday. Loot of the very
youth of music is the concerto, and as
new to-day as when it was written. Peo
ple were very glad cf it. The absence of
strain, it* spontaneity, limpid clearness of
construction, bubbling melody, came In
prateful contrast to the involved and
labored song of too many of the moderns.
Throughout the concerto sings the Joy of
living. It is a comedy of manners of the
period. At once arch and stately, one
Ferg the day's grand dames move to its
rprightly measures. Not a note too
much is there, nor too little. Master
Handel has net talked when he had noth
ing to ray. And how the audience en
joy d his story! It would have had that
second movementâ like young laughterâ
pgaln had Mr. Scheel permitted. Willy
r.UIy he had to repeat the finale, with
Its delicat*, joyous precieencps. In con
ductor and concerto's triumphs Concert
melsu r Etark, W. von der Mehden and
Franz Adelmann in violin and cello
eoloa here Joined. The string force
throughout showed Itself delightfully in
sympathy wjth the work. It is of course
for strings alone. The Handel, surely, if
time permit amid the host of the novel
tics 11 r. Scheel is granting us this season,
â¢should be among its repetitions.
Little Miss Tromben brings a somewhat
tired but very pretty voice to the role of
Gilda. It is a swept and pure little pipe,
but has ben rather forced out of its
natural dimensions, becoming in the
fortes thin and somewhat screamy. But
the singer knows otherwise how to use
the voice, which has something oddly
fascinating in its qualityâ a touch of the
oboe in its flutfness. She Is a nervous
and Intense little person and dramatically
gives a Gildaâ you remember Repetto's
rockir.g-chairy editibn of the role?â about
its opposite. "Caro Nome" was very
prettily sung and evoked a noisy encore.
Tedeschi, the tenor, was new last night.
He is rather new altogether, a sort of
Infant phenomenon, a boy wonder. But
be*D mend of that, as Pitt once apolo
gized for himself, and if the coming years
do as much for him as have bygone
years SJ^nor Tedeschi will do well.* His
voice volume is small, to match his physi
cal 'Â¦nvtlnpe, bat he uses his organ with
considerable taste rind case. Further it
is of notably agreeable quality, smooth,
fine and sympathetic. His acting is
youthful and enthusiastic and quite
promising.
During the last two years Ferrari has
,bwn the Tivoli's Hipo'.etto, and only his
Kiga.ro was better. But one never knew
which *-::d was which of the Ferrari trem
olo. The problems of pitch were constant
]y appalling, ard in the duo work particu
larly one harCly knew whether Signor
Korrari or oneself were standing on one's
lu-ad. It generally ftlt like both. How
ever, the- King is dead, and but for the vi
luato was a worthy monarch enough.
And new, lcng live (Jregoretti!
The best of the Kigoletti within my Tiv
oli memory it- the new barytone. He con
lirmed amply last night one's lirst fa
vorable impressions of him. A beautiful
piano he has, and a voice whose sym
pathy is sensitive and certain to every
dramatic need. There was last nightâ
apparently a vocal moodâ the tendency
tc sing sharp, but Gregoretti is undoubt
Â«dly the bent barytone since Salassa. I
have never heard the "Veglia, o donna"
given more expressively, and the singer
was here ably seconded by Signorina
Trcmben. The dramatic scene with the
courtiers where the jester discovers the
abduction or Gilda. and between gibes
at them and his despair sings the "Corti
piana vi! razza dannata," was also inter
preted with eloquent power and passion.
In every phase of the role Signer Grego
retti proved himprlf an artist, his admir
able facial expression not to te forgotten
among his accomplishments.
Its reception last right at the Tivoli
proved that "Rlscleito" has lost no Jot of
its power to move an audience. First of
the operas to brins fame to Verdi, its
popularity continues unabated. Included
in every season's prosramme. the opera
amply justifies its admission, seeming to
srow only more welcome. Opportunities
such as that afforded by the central role
are rurc, on the dramatic side more par-
Ticulariy. for. the jester's part tests every
side of the singer's equipment. Vocally
the role is nobly grateful, and pa.tb.os, pas
sion arid tenderness are equally demanded
from the actor.

FOR some reason that M. A. New
ell Is unable to explain interest
in the overdue American ship
Helen Brewer has taken a new
lease of life and yesterday a con
siderable sum was invested on taa ves
sel's chance of* arrival. Local speculators
have more than $200,000 placed on this
vessel. It has been placed "to arrive,"
and the greater part of It at from SO to
90 per cent. She is now out 1S7 days from
Scurabaya for Delaware Breakwater, but
in ppite of the length of passage faith in '
her safety is strong and seems strongest
where the ship is best known. Honolulu
has taken a big interest in the Brewer
and speculators of the island port have
invested several thousand dollars on her.
The rate of reinsurance on the Aria
tides was advanced yesterday to SO per
cent. She Is now out 103 days from Co
leta Eucna for this port. The rate en
the SIrius was advanced to 50 per cent.
The British bark Andora, at 15 per
cent, is the latest addition to the overdue
list. She is out 140 days from Baltimore
lor Iquique.
Alnong- those present at the convention
were Dr. G. H. Aiken of Fresno, Dr..Da
vis of Stockton, Dr. Rugglcs of Stockton,
formerly a member of the State Board
of Health; Mrs. Dr. Ryerson Butin of
Madera. Dr. Ira B. I^add of Stockton. Dr.
Carothers of Martinei. Dr. William Simp
eon of San Joee, Dr. H. C. Brown of San
Jose, Dr. J. L- Asay of San Jose and Dr.
Robert T. l>gget of McCloud.
At the afternoon session Dr. A. P.
O'Brien addressed the convention. Dr. D.
H. Currie of the United States marine
hospital service read a paper on "Rats
end the Danger of Their Spreading Dis
ease." Engineer Grunsky showed the
plans for the new German hospital and
explained the modern innovations that
Â¦will be Introduced.
Dr. William Simpson, health officer of
Santa. Clara County, raised a laugh by
asking Dr. Aiken how he had been able
to get so much money for the suppression
of smallpox. He said that last year he
had 150 cases and that he was only al
lowed $3000 by the county and that he was
told that he was bankrupting it Dr.
Simpson went into details about the dan
ger of contagion in smallpox and quoted
a case at Coyote, where an old woman
who washed the clothes of children who
were supposed to be suffering from chick
?n pox became attacked with smallpox
and later gave it to five other people,
three of the cases dying.
THE SMALLPOX QUESTION.
The members of the convention then
drifted to the subject of smallpox and the
danger cf contagion. Dr. Aiken of Fresno
opened the cMs*eussion. He said that near
ly all the smallpox that appeared in Fres
no County was owir.g to the lax atten
tion to quarantine by health officers cf
other counties. In Fresno County alone
$4<\000 had been expended In the last two
years in suppressing the disease. Some
of the smallpox patients were recent ar
rivals from the East and some came from
adjoining counties. What was needed at
once was a uniformity in all counties in
the enforcement of State health laws. He
knew that Fresno had the reputation of
being a very hot pla.ee. but he also felt
proud that the city was known as a place
where sanitary laws were respected and
cbeyed. Owing to the milk regulations
and the inspection of meat the death rate
for the last two years had been reduced
23 per cer.t. he said.
Professor W. B. Rising, In charge of
the chemistry department cf the Univer
sity of California, followed with a paper
en "Food Adulteration." He dwelt on the
crime of tampering with food and also
emphasized the fact that all goods when
imitations of other thinps should be
plainly marked so that the purchaser
v.fiuld not bo misled.
TAKPEBLNG WITH' FOOD.
W. I. Foley. an attorney of Los An
{reks. was then introduced to the conven
tion. He read a most Interesting paper
o:i the subject, "The Necessity of More
Direct Rec:j'.ation of the Public Health
by the Statfi I'nder Its General Police
Power." H* said in part:
Politicians nurt learn that the subject of

POLICE REGULATIONS.
ANTIQUATED LAWS.
Dr. Foster said that the work of the
F:ate Beard of Health was extremely
Â«1itficult on account of two troubles, the
Jirst being that the laws in reference to
enforcing sanitary measures were anti
quated, and the second that a lack of
interest was shown by health officers of
the State. He said that he did not mean
to attack personally those present, but
he was disappointed to see oniy a hand
ful of health officers, when there were
about 150 cf them in th*Â» State. He sug
gested that tue convention and organiza
tion be made permanent and that the
r.cxt meeting cf the association be held

the organization to meet once a year to
attempt to revi*Â» the sanitary laws cf
the State and by mutual exchange of
ideas work in more perfect harmony in
the future. At the session yesterday Dr.
Martin Repensburger, chairman cf the
State Board of Health, was elected presi
dent cf the new medical association and
Dr. N. K. Foster f-ecretary.
At the opening of the session yesterday
morning a.t 13 o'clock Dr. Regensburger
made a few preliminary remarks. He
paid that at a mot-ting some time ago
ot the State Board of Health it was sug
gested that if a few of the many oltl
riaJs attached to the health boards
throughout the State were to meet otfea-
Klonally it would be most advantageous.
There were many pubjeuts that should

the prevention of the contusion of riv

The State Board cf Health was unable
to perure statistics in regard to births,
and this among other subjects could be
discussed by an organization of State
health officers and undoubtedly many im
provements could be made in this way.
the speaker said. In closing he called
upon Dr. Foster, secretary of the Slate

ject.

Sailor in Serious Trouble.
Captain A. H. Scott of the Gerard C.
Tobey and Mate William P. Canty of the
same vessel received sentence yesterday
at the hands of Supervising Inspector
Captain John Bermingham for having en
gaged in a mutual belaying pin, monkey
wrench man-eating contest on the high
seas on August 4. Their licenses were
suspended for forty days. The complaint
was made by Canty, but the evidence
showed that Canty had been as much to
blame as the captain and had been dis
armed of a hammer and an iron belaying
pin before the captain bit a piece of flesh
out of hia chest. In fact Canty showed
too great a willingness to fight with his
superior officer, and started the mix up
by calling the captain a "lime juicer,"
which blood purifying epithet seems to
call for the spilling of blood whenever
applied to a sailor.

In the criminal trial of Beale and Wil
liams, whlcli was conducted before Judge
Cook In December and resulted In their
acquittal on January 6. the story of their
attack upon Marriott, editor and proprie
tor of the San FrsncJsco News Letter,
was fully exploited. As the result of an
alleged defamatory article against his af
nanced wife which appeared in the publi
cation of the News Letter- of August 30
Beale betook hlmse.- to the house of the
editor on the night of September 3, ac
companied by Williams, there to demand
a retraction. The testimony devolved the
fact that In a scuffle which ensued as the
result of the meeting Williams flred three
shots at Marriott in alleged self-defense,
two of which produced serious wounds.
In the complaint wnich Marriott makes
for the recovery of damages he alleges
that the wounds caused by- the shots from
Williams' revolver, besides causing him
great physical agony, forced him tq re
main under a physician's care for more
than s!x weeks.* entailed great expense
and left him permanently injured. Mar
riott was represented in court yesterday
by Attorneys .Albert Johnson. Hiram
Johnson and Bruce Cornwall. Attorneys
Peter F. Dunne and Harry T. Creswell
have been retained for the defendants.
After devoting several hours to the im
paneling of a jury, in whfch pfocess the
attorneys exerted all possible care in the
selection, there were chosen to decide
upon the merits of the case George R.

CHICAGO, Sept. 8.â Wheat was strong at
the opening. Influenced by bad weather in the
Northwest. December being %@%c higher at
&2%<582%c. There was but little rallying
power and the close was but a shade above
.the bottom at 81%<?81%c, *a loss of %Â®%c
from Friday's final figure.. . . .
News from the corn belt to-day wan ex
tremely bearish and predictions of light frosts
In Kansas and Nebraska to-night had but little
'effect acainst the summer-like weather of th<Â»
past three days. December options sold off
from 52c at the opening to 50%c, steadying a
trifle at the close to 51\ic. . . Â¦
Oats were affected to some extent by the
weakness In corn. - Local longs and commis
sion houses led the selling, but email receipts
and some unfavorable crop news prevented a
large decline. December closed %c lower at
37@37%c after ranging between 37c and 37%c.
, The near-by deliveries in provisions were
stronp. packers selling Â¦ the deferred product.
The demand was sufficient to hold prices,
however, with the exception of pork, which,
due 'to the weakness In com," showed a loss.
October pork was 6e lower, lard was up 12%Â®
15c and ribs 22%Â«525c higher.

tinued rather light and prices of such stock
were well sustained. There was an abund
ance of poor fruit, however, which had been
accumulating for some days, particularly Sat
urday and Monday, and prices for that class
of goods were unsteady. Peaches In small
packages were firm under steadily decreasing
receipts and a good demand, both for local
use and shipping account. Offerings In largo
opea boxes cleaned up readily under a steady
demand from canners and the regular trade.
.The demand for shipment on the Puget Sound
steamer, which sailed yesterday, was con
fined chiefly to Grapes, and prices o* choice
offerings In crates were firm In the early
morning under limited supplies. Fancy fresh
stock Intended for that purpose arrived too
late for the steamer and was offered freely to
the local trade at easy prices. 75c per crate
being the highest price obtained for the very
best stock. The market closed weak with a
heavy surplus unsold. Several consignments
of Wine Granes arrived from Antloch and
were offering at easier rates. Prices of Ap
ples, Ppars and Quinces were unchanged. Com
mon and wormy Apples were still abundant
and Inactive. Plums and . Prunes were easy
and Pomegranates were very dull. Figs ar
rived freely from several sections, and sold
at a~ wide range of prices aa .to quality, va
riety and style of package. Pomegranates
were offering freely, but found few buyers,
owing to the poor quality of the offerings.
Watermelons were active, owing to the warm
weather, and prices were maintained. Can
taloupes and Nutmeg Melons, too, were in
Koort demand, but prices ranged lower under
heavy receipts and a large carry-over from
the preceding day. Berries were easier. - Rasp
berries arrived too late for the regular trade,
and a large portion of the receipts of Straw
berries were very poor and had to be disposed
of quickly. . Blackberries and Huckleberries
were in amrle supply,' and stood about the
6a me.

NEW YORK. Sept. S.â Unusual dullness,
even for this period of the year, characterized

strain en tee . movement of currency. Last
week's buying of Atchison shares was resumed
and F<jm<? activity was shown by Canadian

brought movement in several of the ipecial
ties. North American advancing 2%. Colorado
Fuel 2*i and Consolidated Gas X%. No sig
nificance attached to the advance in these
shart-p. Pome of the early selling of Amalga
mated Copier was tractd to houses with Bos
ton connections. ; The fitnek closed at the low
est figure of the day. in spite of an advance
in the price of metal at home and abroad. In
the final hour thtre was some thort selling of
such stocks as St. Paul. Atchison, Rock

Increase for July of over $2CO.00O. New York
Central. Norfolk and Western and Mexican
Central, TexaÂ« and Pacific and some of the
xniTior stocks filso showed materisLl f ains in
grcss earnings. The feature of the foreign
exchange market was the appearance for tne
: Orst time this year of bills covering shares ol
fpot cotton. These did not appear, however,
in quantities sufficient to weaken the ex
clftinee. -which held firm. But the very fact
that fuch bills were released was taken to
murk the beginning of a larger export move
ment for that fta&le. Exchange brokers for
weeks l^ave been looking forward to the Inau
guration of this movement as affording the
best basis for depressing the sterling market
to a level where geld could be used as a form
of remittance. Locally the monetary situa
tion was unchanged. Additional gold Imports
!rom Australia were reported and further pay
ment? for account of gold dn>oslte<i at tian
Francisco were made by the gub-TreasuryÂ«
The bond market was rather quiet and
ebowed some irregularity in the 'early deal
ings. Total sales, $1.2t'.o,0W.
United States 4s advanced \i per cent and
the â¢'.Â« ri per cent on the laet call.

New York Stock Market.
Two cars of Western Poultry were marketed
since Saturday and sold off well at steady
prices. The demand for the past few days
was steady, and both local and Western stock
cleaned up quickly, the market 'having -pre
viously been bare. The demand for laree
young fowl was particularly brisk, and occa
sional-lots of extra fine ' young '. stock com
mandtd a premium over the quotations. Geese,
Ducks and Roosters were quoted higher.
Young Turkeys were offering freely and found
quick sales at high* prices. A third car of
Western Poultry will be marketed this mom
ing. Game in good condition sold promptly at
previous prices, but a large portion of the of
ferings were In bad order, owning to the
warm,- close weather, and had to be dumped.

ed a very poor condition for the early bean
crop.- and the effect of the recent heavy rains
was very evident. Reports from the section
Etate that the rains .have beaten the vines
down and Into the ground, and some havÂ«
been practically destroyed. The early bean
crop will not. It is stated, amount to any
thing this year. Some beans have been cut
and caught In the rain. In some sections the
yield. It Is stated, will not be over three bush
els per acre. The average yield under favora
ble conditions Is said to be 15 bushels per
acre. To-day private advices from the Euro

last night at Lurline . baths between two
teams plcxed from the Lurllne Swimming
Club. Although the score, 4 to 1, does not
seem close the game was one of the fast
est and best played at the baths for some
time. W. Harris captained a team to vic
tory consisting of W., P. Stockton, E.
Smith, H. Kennerson, O. Schultz, A.
Heinz and O. Harris. The losing team
was made up of W. Pomln, captain; H.
Seebach, G. Bray. W. Kelly, J. A. Jack
son, A. D. Schmidt and D. Dawson. A
game of. water polo will be played at Su
tro baths during the Bankers', convention
next month, between teams of the Lur
llne and Olympic clubs. It should prove
a good game, as the L-urllne Club men
have never been defeated, while the
Olympic Club possesses a number of ex
cellent swimmers.

SWIFT YACHTS TO STABT
IN THE ANNUAL REGATTA
The consolation tournament was won in
clever fashion by Clarence Griffin, who
beat Alexander Beyfuss in the final. The
score was 7-5. 6-4. Griffin also beat James
Code, 7-5, 6-0. and Paul Jones. 6-1. 8-0.
Beyfuss won his two matches by default.
The tournament will be completed to
day. This morning the challenge match
in women's singles will be played. Miss
Florence Button, the tournament winner,
will meet Miss May Sutton, the champion,
at 10:30 o'clock. At 2:30 o'clock in the
afternoon Louis Freeman. the* Coast
champion in singles, will defend his title
against Alfonso Bell, the challenger. This
should be a great match.
The mMch was the most spectacular
and exciting of the meeting.
In the first set MacGavin was the star
of the four and the way he killed lobs
â¢was a revelation. He was weak on his
service, however, and, like his partner,
fell down at critical times. Smith was
not as steady as usual and his strokes
seemed to lack their usual force. ThÂ»
score in favor of Bell and Freeman was
6-3. 6-4, 3-10. 6-2.
.Of the four contestants Bell probably
played the best game, his handling of lobs
being remarkable. Freeman seemed to
tire toward the end and netted many easy
balls.
Excitement ran high at San Rafael
yesterday when the championship tennis
match in men's doubles was in progress.
A. E. Bell and I*. R. Freeman (holders)
successfully defended their title against
Grant Smith and Drummond MacGavin
(challengers). It was the last hope of a
northern victory and the spectators dhi
their utmost to help the home players
win. The champions were steady whila
Smith and MacGavin seemed somewhat
off in their play. The losers did not
display- their form of . last . year, while
Freeman and Bell were probably stronger
than ever. .

OUTDOOR ART LEAGUE
HOLDS IMPORTANT MEETING
President Wheeler upon being requested
to impart his views on the subject said
there was no doubt as to the desirability
of the department proposed by Regent
Yorke. It would please a. large element.
"We give instruction In Slavic, we teach
Hebrew and Semitic, we give instruction*
In Sanscrit: it would be a good thing
for the university to have such a depart
ment," he said.
The subject was referred to the finance
committee In accordance with the rules
as amended, and at the request of Regent
Yorke.
Regent Peter C. Yorke moved that a
department for instruction In the Celtic
language be established at the university
and that the salary of the instructor be
fixed at $1000 per year. He spoke of the
work that had been done by the Ger
mans In this line of philology during the
past seventy-five years. He remarked
that men of science recognized the im
portance of the work, and said that Ox
ford. Cambridge, Harvard. Yale. Johns
Hopkins and the Berlin universities had
established. departments of Celtic. In or
der to meet objections which might arise
regarding means at hand to defray the
cost. Regent Yorke suggested that the
position of instructor be not filled at pres
ent.
Regent McEnerney seconded Regent
Yorke's motion.
Regent McEnerney called up a proposed
amendment to the rules presented at a
previous meeting. The amendment, which
was adopted, provides that money can
not be expended without recommendation
of the finance committee unless the rules
be suspended.
Resolved. That- th^ president of the univer
sity and the committee. on the medical status
of the university, or the remaining members
thereof, he requested to prepare and makj| to
this board at its October meeting a full r^.ort
of the present conditions of the medical de
partment of the university and any recom
mendation they may have to make concerning
Its future conduct.
Regent McEnerney Introduced the fol
lowing resolution, which was adopted aft
er spirited discussion:
MEDICAX DEPARTMENT.
the house and certain lands was obvious.
"The cost of maintaining the property Is
great. The deficit exceeds $1SOO a year.
Hereafter we will have an Income of $3000
a year, exclusive of the profits of the
Bear Gulch "Water Company."
The new deed conveys back to Cora
Jane Flood the house and 325 acres of
land. The Regents retain 214 acres of
upland, a half interest in 2400 acres of
marsh land and the stock of the Bear
Gulch Water Company. The report of
the committee was adopted. Regent Budd
voted against concurrence. Regent Mc-
Enerney was excused from voting.
Regent Slack wanted to know all about
the sociecy,' its purposes, policies and as-
The- finance committee reported in fa
vor of accepting the offer, of the Society
of the Golden Bear to build a hall on the
university grounds, to be known as Senior
Hall. The Golden Bears agree to expend
$3000 in the construction of the hall. They
propo3e, also, to maintain it and ask the
use of one small room. .
Regent Tausslg believed that the board
would make a great mistake if it allowed
this' or any other, society to erect a build
ing on the nuiversity grounds. '
Regent Dohrmann explained the action
of the committee, maintaining that the
offer f,rom the Golden Bear Society was

ed in favor of deeding back to Miss Flood
the house in San'Mateo County and alsp
certain lands in consideration of the offer
from her of $150,000 in gold coin. The
original gift from her contained a provis

be furnished is estimated at 24,000,000 gal

pirations. In the course of the discussion
the fact was elicited that Regent Charles
S. Wheeler was a Golden Bear, and he
was prevailed upon to state some of the
objects of the society and to tell whether
it was an open organization or a secret
exclusive society. Mr. Wheeler as a'brand
new Golden Bear, and an honorary one at
that, was impelled by a sense of delicacy
to limit his utterances concerning the
scope and purposes of the organization to
a simple declaration that it was com
posed of men who had given positive
proof of their loyalty to the university.
Responding to inquiries he said it was not
a college secret society, but admitted that
it was in one sense secret. He did not
care to explain the particular phase of
secrecy.
"The murdered child was evidently
taken up on the hill by some one living
In another part of the city, for none of
the Italian residents of that quarter
would be likely to have in their possession
a newspaper from an Eastern city. The
address of Hon. J. K. Jones on the Buf
falo paper would seem to Indicate that
the guilty party was from the Kast, if
not from Washington, Ark., itself. My
belief that some stranger stopping In the
city did the deed is strengthened by the
fact that the place on Telegraph Hill
was such an unusual one to choose for
the disposal of the child's boiy that no
one but a stranger would be likely to
climb away up there to hide the evidence
of guilt."
Diligent search of all the lodging-houses
and hotels in the vicinity failed to reveal
the names of any person or persons from
Arkansas who were making their' home
in the immediate neighborhood. The po
lice have acknowledged themselves baf
iled and so the tiny bit of humanity,
murdered within a few hours of its first
breath, will have to be burled In the pot
ter's field, with its grave unmarked and
its slayer unpunished.
DETECTIVE'S THEORY.
The terrified boys summoned Mrs. Ryan
of 3 Calhoun street. Mrs. Lawson of 22G^Â£
Green street and Mrs. Bennenudi of 22S
Green street to view their erewsome find
and then dispatched Nathan Ftrrioggiaro,
a companion, to notify the Morgue of
ficials. After the tiny body of the infant
had been removed to the Morgue Dr.
Baclgalupl, autopsy surgeon, performed
a post-mortem examination and declared
that the babe had \ come to its death
through strangulation. He gave it as
his opinion that the child had been born
without medical attendance and that It
had not been dead more than a day.
Upon the report of the surgeon De
tective Reynolds was immediately dis
patched on the case. After working on
the detail for several hours the detective
acknowledged that he had absolutely no
clew and that unless some unforeseen cir
cumstance arose the case would probably
remain shrouded in mystery. â¢ He said:
BABE IS 'STRANGLED.
It was shortly after 1 o'clock yesterday
afternoon that two youths, William Nel
son of 1257 Montgomery street and Oscar
Kunet of 292 Union street, while strolling
through the narrow lot bounded by Green
and Calhoun streets and the brink of Gray
Bros.' quarry, spied a bundle of papers,
roughly tied with string. Unrolling a
sheet of yellow wrapping paper, a copy
of a loqal daily of the date of July 26
and the Buffalo sheet, they were horrified
to find the perfectly developed body of
a male Infant curled ud within the Inner
wrappings. A common cotton siring was
bound about its neck tightlv enough to
arouse the suspicion that the child had
been strangled to death.
Lpon one of the newspaper wrappings
about the body of the babe, the Buffalo
i^7, Cn !u B Tlmes of Wednesday. August 19,
1903, there is a printed mailing slip bear
ing the legend: "Hon. J. K. Jones. Wash
ington, Ark.â Evening Bulletin." How the
private paper of a man who is now sit
ting in the Senate of the United States
could ccme to be used aa the shroud of
a murdered infant found on tho brink of
a quarry in San Francisco is one of the
secrets of crime which will probably re
main forever locked from the eves of the
police.
There lies on a slab at the Mcrsrue a
tiny boy baby, who was murdered ' when
scarce he had seen the light of day. "A
knotted cotton string about the inno
cent's throat tells the tale of the cruel
hands which robbed it of life, hardly
before- its blue eyes could smile upon the
lace of the woman who gave it birth.
Once murdered the hapless babe was
bundled Into a parcel of old newspapers
and cast away In a vacant lot 'away up

MAJOR MHOON'S RESIGNATION.
The special order immediately after the
reading of the minutes was a motjon
made by Regent Budd at a. previous
meeting that the resignation of Attorney
J. B. Mhoon be accented.
Regent Reinstcin spoke of the long and
efficient service of Major Mhoon. He
moved that the resignation be not ac
cepted, but thdt Major Mhoon and his
law partner, O^good Putnam, be retained
as counsel. Mention was made of the
Major's thirty years' service as counsel
of the regents and also of the fact that
Mr. Putnam had performed the duties of
attorney for the past five years.
Regent Budd raised the point that Mr.
Reinstoin's motion w?.s out of order and
the chair sustained the point.
Regent McEnerney indorsed all that
was said in commendation of Major
Mhoon, but in view of the Major's long
absence from the State he was compelled
to vote for the acceptance of the resig
nation. It was with great reluctance,
however, that he voted to terminate the
public service of the oldest employe of
the board; Â¦
The motion to accept prevailedâ ayes
IS. noes 2. Regents voting in the negative
were Reinsteln and Slack. Regent Brit
ton moved that the board proceed to the
election of an attorney. The motion was
carried without dissent.

capable of filling the place. He- re
marked that Mr. Snook had filled honored
positions of trust. There was no stain on
his character. He possessed youth, am
bition and ability.
Regent Charles S. Wheeler nominated
Warren OIney Jr. He spoke of tho at
tainments of Mr. OIney. remarking that
he was a graduate of the University of
California and of the Harvard Law
School.
Regent Reinstein presented the name of
Osgood Putnam, who had acted as coun
sel of the board for five years. The vote
was recorded as follows:

CALIFORNIA'S NATAL DAYnative of the island of Majorca, born
November 24, 1713. Becoming a friar at
the age of 16. he was soon widely known
on account of his brilliant rhetorical
powers. Besides being a fervent worker,
Serra was in his earlier years a decided
flagellant, often emphasizing his exhor
tations by burning himself with a candle,
beating his breast with chains cr bruising
himself with a heavy stone. Of a tender
heart, an Iron will and untiring zeal, be
was the man In a thousand to conduct
the march of civilization in California.
Having come to Mexico in 1749, Father
SeYra was ready to answer the call of
destiny when In 1767 he was appointed to
take charge of the missionary field of
Alta California.
God's Faithful Steward,
Priest and Pioneer,
Junipero Serra.
yÂ»Â«ITH Loreta In Baja California,
ii) a a the starting point, two expe
*^^ dltions by land and two
by sea Were dispatched to San
Miguel, the s site of the present city of
San Diego. The ship San Carlos sailed
from Cape Saint Lucas on January 11,
1769, and after a disastrous voyage of
three and a half months, reached her
destination. The ship San Antonio, though
It started a month later than the San
Carlos, reached San Miguel on April 11,
1769, thus marking the date of the first
colonization of California. The two land
expeditions, over one of which Serra waa
in command, reached their destination in
safety in the following months and the
first California settlement was started
with a full complement of half a hundred
soldiers and friars.
No sooner had Serra arrived than he
immediately started the mission of San
Diego. Directly afterward Captain Por
tala, Friars Crespi and Gomez and a
small party of colonists and friendly In
dians started out to locate the famous
harbor of Monterey, which had been lost
to tha ken of man for a century. By
some mishap, however, Portala and his
party passed Monterey Bay without rec
ognizing it. They traveled as far north
as Point San Pedro and then, on the first
day of November, 1769, a party which
had left the main camp to follow some
deer over the low sandhills, returned
open-mouthed to camp with the report
that they had discovered a great open
sea,- stretching north and south as far
as the eye could reach and surrounded
by Interminable lines of mountains. â¢ Thus
it was that San Francisco Bay, after
eluding the vigilant eyes of adventurous
mariners for two hundred years, became
Old Prints Tell the Tale of Incidents in Our Early History.
the Nova Albion of Drake was not in the
harbor of San Francisco.
Sebastian Vlscayno, commissioned by
the Viceroy of Spain in 1602, undertook to
find a sunken treasure galleon from Ma
nila which had been reported as lost on
the California coast. He too sailed past
San Francisco Bay unawares and re
turned to Mexico with a glowing account
of the harbor of Monterey. Strange as it
may seem, Monterey Bay then became the
special object of quest for the Spanish In
Mexico, but for 166 years after Vlscayno
left its waters it was never again found
by the searching mariners.
For more than the space of a century
the history of California now became a
blank. Sundry cursory and fruitless ef
forts at the discovery of a northwest
passage to Asia were made by Spanish
viceroys up to the year 1688, when all ac
tivity ceased. It fell to the lot of that
father of California explorers, Father
Junlpero Serra, to do yeoman work In
the civilization of our great State. The
work of civilizing the Indians of Baja
California was carried on faithfully by
the Jesuit order under Fathers Kuhn and
Salvatierra, backed by the active support
of the Spanish viceroys, until 1776, when
the captious Charles III of Spain expelled
the order and gave over their missions to
the Franciscan monks.
Of this order was Junlpero Serra, a
A remarkable and romantic event oc
curred at about the same time as Jlmi
nez" discovery, which shows the terrors
and awful hardships which were under
gone by these restless pioneers of discov
ery. According to the quaint old chroni
cles of the Jesuit Father Miguel Venegas,
four Spaniards. Alvar Nunez, Cabcza de
Vaca, Castillo, Dorantes and a negro
named Estevanclo, dragged themselves
into Cullacan, on the Gulf of California,
in the year 1537 with a terrible story on
their lips. They were the sqle survivors
of the band of 300 under the command of
Pamfilo Navaraez, which had undertaken
the conquest of Florida in 1527. For ten
years they had wandered through the
deserts of the great Southwest, leaving
their dead companions one by one to rot
in their heavy armor on the burning
sands'and in the bleak mountains. Only
a few years ago the bleached bones of
men, encased in Spanish armor, â¢ were
found in a cave in New Mexico. Could
these have been a- part of Navaraez'
luckless adventurers?
Through a subsequent voyage of Cap
tain Francisco de Ulloa In 1539, California
received its name. The cause for Ulloa's
christening the new land by this name
has been the object of much antiquarian
wrangling, but Dr. Edward Everett Hale
has given as the most probable sponsor
for the name, a mythical land In a Span
ish romance of the time â "Sergas of Es
planadian," which was peopled by demons
and griffins innumerable and called the
Island of California.
Out of the many abortive explorations
and tragic voyages of the time, that of
Mendoza proved to be a typical Spanish
taskmaster and drove his crew to
desperation by his cruelties. Under
the leadership of one Fortuno Jime
nez, the pilot of the vessel, the
crew mutinied, murdered Mendoza
and sailed northward on a private buc
caneering expedition under the command
of the doughty Jimenez. The adventur
ous pilot went as far north as what is
now called the Bay of La Paz, on the
western coast of Lower California, about
100 miles north of Cape St. Lucas. There
the party landed. They were attacked
by hostile Indians, Jimenez and most of
his fellows were killed and only a rem
nant survived to carry the news of the
discovery to Cortez. Thus was California
discovered by a mutineer and pirate who
paid for his adventure with his life.

took place, which resulted In the discov
ery of California.

united under the single hand of the com
andante. He was appointed and re
moved at will by the Viceroy of Mexico.
Under the balmy skies of distant Cali
fornia It was a dream life which waa
lived In those days. The earth gave of
her Increase. The Increasing stream of
settlers from Mexico brought with them,
the happy, careless manana spirit of old
Spam. Arcadia was born again. But on
the fair horizon the clouds of future tur
moil began to gather with tne dawn of
the nineteenth century.
Scarcely had the noise of the American
Revolution on the other side of the con
tinent penetrated to far-distant, dreaming
California, when the Inquisitive American
himself began, to slip down from the
lofty Sierras to worry the snuffy old com
andantes with their ubiquitous spying
and prying.
The dreaded Columbia did not trouble
Comandante Arguello. however, for she
kept on to the Columbia River and tnere
laid the seeds for future contention with
Great Britain.
The Russians also began to become a
menace about this time. The French
traveler De Mofras mentions In his
memoires the appearance In San Francisco
in May, 1307, of one. Von Resanoff, Cham
berlain of the Emperor of Russia, who
came with an eye to establishing com
mercial relations between Russia and the
l province. The Russians, however, entered
the so-called peninsula of California with*
out even asking permission of the Spanish.
In 1S12 they had come dawn from tha
north and established themselves at- tbÂ«
port of Bodega In a colony of ZOO.
This colony of fishermen and trappers
greatly worried the Spanish Inhabitants
of California. They feared the Incursion
of a foreign people and an opposing re-'
llglon. It threatened the utter overthrow
of their arcadian existence. It was a men
ace to the possession of a new world.
Accordingly when the home government
could not be aroused to enter a protest tha
padres took It upon themselves to carry
the war Into the enemy's country. They
crossed the bay and founded the mission
of San Rafael In 1819 and that of San
Francisco Solano at Sonoma In 1S23. At
Fort Ross the Russian* had erected a
church. The spectacle of the Greek and
Roman crosses flashing defiance across a
few miles of intervening territory was
one of the oddities of old California. The
rival dogmas had met In a new land, each
having encircled the globe In opposite di
rections.
Gathering Storm Clouds
Cast Shadow of War
and Conquest
STJT the swift movement of succeed
ing events soon brought to Spain
a trouble far greater than the
threatened danger to her religion.
The fires of revolt were started
in her colonies of South America
and one by one they lysgan to fall away
from the mother country. California, re
maining stanch to the throne. In the
year 1818 was made to feel the first throes
of years of Impending rebellion and dis
order. The newly emancipated republic
of Buencs Ayres sent one Captain Hip
polyte Bouchard, in command of a priva
teering force, to compel the submission of
Alta California. The renegade French
roan attacked and reduced to surrender
the capital city of Monterey, causing Gov
ernor de Sola to retreat Inland. After
burning the presidio, Bouchard sailed
away and California was for a time free.
The news of the successful liberal up
rising of 1S20 in Spain soon after fired all
Mexico to emulate the example and under
the leadership of Iturblde, Mexico pro
claimed its freedom in February, 1X3.
Iturblde assumed the title first of Regent
and later, In the intoxication of new
found power, that of Emperor.
Almost immediately he called upon Gov
ernor de Sola of Alta California to recog
nize the Independent government of Mex
ico as his liege. The greatly puzzled Gov
ernor therefore called a junta of the four
comandantes of the presidios and of
Father Payras, representing the missions,
to meet in Monterey on April 9. â¢ A deputa
tion from Mexico completed the personnel
of this, the first legislative gathering in
California. Its object was soon accom
plished, for after a brief session. It recog
nized the new government and all the offi
cers took the oath of office as members
of the Department of Alta California of
the Empire Â¦ of Mexico.
Onl> one more step was needed to make
the department a living part of the Em
pire of Mexico. On November 9. a com
missioner from Iturbide assembled as a
legislative assembly the individuals who
had attended the junta in April. Ex-Gov
ernor de Sola was chosen Deputy to the
Mexican Cortes and Captain Luis Ar
guello, a native Californian, was elected
first Mexican Governor of the new Mexi
can territory., / ; .^*:'%
Settled in a country which needed but
the touch of man to cause it to
blossom like a garden, the mission
fathers were â¢ the first to discover
the hidden, wealth - of agriculture,
which was so grossly overlooked in
the frantic days of gold to follow.
The olive 'and the vine, brought
from Mexico In the holds of ships, yielded
fruit an hundred fold. From the hardy
droves of cattle and herds of sheep driven
up from the arid plains of the south there
sprung the thousands 'of cloven hoofs
which were to make the ranges rich
abodes of cattle kings In the splendid
days before the argonauts came. â¢ It was
the missions which laid the first founda
tions of California's future greatness.
The civil government of the province
had its foundations in the presidios or
military encampments situated usually
hard by the missions. These rude forts
were under the rule of the commandante,
who was responsible alone to the Gov
ernor of the Province of California. Con
stitution or charter were absolutely lack-
this despotic course the missions
A% gradually began to gather about
â¢^Â¦^ithem a steadily growing community,
closely knit and an excellent unit for the
groundwork of a vast government. The
mission fathers rarely abused their power
and worked steadily and surely for the
advancement of church and state.
jj brief survey of the work which
Â£J* was done by the missions and
**&' their mode of government will
serve to give an Idea of the part played
by them In the history of our State.
Wherever a mission waa founded there
the Indians would flock in great numbers.
And right barren soil did these low-lived
aborigine* offer for the spiritual seed
which the mission fathers sought to Im
plant therein. By far the mental and
physical Inferiors of the plains Indians or
the Moquls, Navajos and Pueblos of the
Southwest, the California Indians were
little higher In the human scale than tha
Bushmen of Africa or aborigines of Aus
tralia. They lived on Insects, roots and
nuts; they recognized no bonds of mar
riage or family ties; they knew no arts
save the rude crafts of the stone age.
Filthy In habits, sluggish of Intellect, sub-.
Jecta of loathsome diseases, the Califor
nia Indian was the lowest of his kindâ
little better than the brutes.
Recognizing the character of the crea
tures ' with whom they had to deal, the
padres mapped out their government for
them accordingly. The Indian was made
to give his body as well as his soul Into
the safe keeping of the ecclesiastical mas
ters. They were given adobe huts to
live in and furnished a regular supply
of food from the mission granaries and
gardens. They were given spiritual edu
cation. Here their benefits ceased. The
mission Indian could not own any prop
erty. He was forbidden to till any soil
save that of the mission, and this act
was made compulsory. No choice was
given- him in the selection of his place
of dwelling, in the care of his children
or the disposition of his leisure hours. He
was bound by a wisely forged chain to
the center of civilization which owned his
life and soul.

Monterey Bay was finally located by a

on June S the Mission of Ban Carlos and
tha presidio of Monterey were established
by the Indefatigable Father Junlpero.
With such enthusiasm were .the reports

founding of new missions. By 1773 new
centers of civilization had been established
at San Antonio, San Gabriel, Ban Luis
Obispo, San Juan Caplstrano and San
Francisco.
While Serra was In Mexico In consulta
tion with the Viceroy In 1774 the ship San
Carlos had been sent up to Investigate
Ban Francisco Bay with the view of
establishing a mission thereon. In the
month of June, 1775, this first vessel to
pass through the Golden Gate made a

Its arms and returned to report to Father
Berra In glowing terms upon the great
body of water locked within the chain of
the hills. As a result the lengthening
arm of the church was stretched out to
thÂ« great bay and on March 22, 1776, the
site of Mission Dolores was determined
upon and the settlement of San Fran
cisco commenced.

In 1522 the first expedition fitted out by
Cortez left Zacatula In Its search for
Asian waters, but it was swallowed up in
the great oblivion somewhere In the Gulf
of California or along the barren coast of
Baja or Lower California. Not a sur
vivor returned to tell the spot where the
bleaching bones of the hardy explorers
lay. The next year two other ships, un
der the command of Hernando Grijalva
and Diego Becerra de Mendoza, were
dispatched by Cortei to learn the fate of
the former expedition and. If possible, ac
complish the mission from which the
other ill fated vessels had never returned.
Grijalva gave up and returned, but on
their antennae, then racing away, doub
ling and turning on their tracks, never
satisfied, but always scrambling on to
new inches yet undiscovered, eo the early
voyagers were ever on the search for new
fields to conquer. In their blind groping
they Etumbled on California by acci
dent.
mm y PON this, our fifty-third anni-
M I versa ry of the admission of Cali-
M^y fornla into the sisterhood of
States, it is emlne-ntly fitting
that we should pause for a
backward look down the vistas of the
years gone by to catch a glimpse of the
long and romantic chain of events which
binds us of the present day to the dim
past. Even now we see before us the
promise that California, the western pil
lar of the continent, has a wonderful des
tiny stretching out before it. Before we
venture to read the Sibylline books too
closely we should know the heroic epic
ef the brave days which have passed;
we should hear the story of the dim
tfays of forgotten centuries when Cali
fornia first emerged cut of the darkness
cf cblivion to play Its part on the world's
great stage.
Ours Is a history which sings. Homer
with his epic lyre never recited to beard
ed king a tale of heroes in an heroic age
which rang with more narrative thrill
than does the story of California. Like
the Odyssey cur tale of adventure has
for Its setting the flower-clad hills, the
rolling, somber mountains, the boundless
blue eea. Our Jason and the Argonauts
sought the golden fleece In the granite
heart of the mountains. Our Ulysses was
& sturdy Englishman in casque and
buckler, who drove his pirate ship In er
rant course up and down the coast In
vain search for a channel as mythical as
the ell-clrcllng Oceanus of the heroic
Greeks. The voyages of adventurers, the
eweet pastoral life of holy monks, the
wild stampede of thousands, drunk with
the greed of gold, the reign of murder and
the final triumph of law and order, work-
Ing for the upbuilding of an empireâ
these are the cantos of our great epicâ
the epic cf California-
Few but scholars know that the original
title to the possession of California came
from the hand of a Pope In Rome and
that our ultimate right to the land we
live on Is found in the last Instance In a
Papal bull, duly stamped and sealed with
the fisherman's ring. None other than
Alexander VI, father of the disreputable
Lucrezla and Caesar Borgia, made the
award of the title to California which has
come to us through the hands of Span
lards and Mexicans.
Previous to the voyage of Columbus in
1402 the Portuguese, under the benign In
fluence of their prince, Henry the Naviga
tor, had rounded the southern cape of
Africa and discovered the Azores Islands,
when Columbus, calling under the patron
age of the court of Spain, made his me
morable discoveries in the West Indies.
Portugal claimed that the lands touched
at by the three historic ships of the great
navigator belonged to the crown of Its
prince by right of the previous discovery
of the Azores. The disputants referred
the contention to His Holiness, Alexander
VI for settlement.
Since In those days no Henry VIII had
yet arisen to defy the temporal power of
God's vicar on earth, the ruler at Rome
could unmake kings at a breath and
change the map at a scratch of the pen.
8o Alexander eat Cown and di
vided the world as he would cut
a pie. Of course it was to his
mind a Cat world which he was parti
tioning, so he drew on the imperfect map
of the time an arbitrary line of longitude
one hundred leagues west of the Azores.
All lands from that line west to the edge
of the world were to be forever in the
STip of Spain; Portugal must satisfy her
eelf with the possession of all discovered
or discoverable lands east of this papal
meridian. Thus on Hay 3, 1493, did a
Pope, long since mouldering in some arch
way of St. Peter's, make over into the
eternal keeping of the crown of Spain the
land we are living upon. For 410 years,
therefore, our land has been, legally at
least, in the possession of the white race.

the history of California is not concerned.
Our country begins to appear on the
et&gre of the great world drama in the
early part of the sixteenth century, when
Hernando Cortez, having established a
colony on the west coast of Mexico, Zaca
tula by name, was fitting out the expe
dition which was to discover California.
Like all of the early voyagers, Cortez
Imagined that the Mexican country was
distinct In itself, but yet a part of the
great continent of Asia. He believed that
a lone strait divided Mexico from India
and teat by lollowlng the western coast
line he could either discover this strait or
map out a new and remarkable route to
the far-famed Cathay of Marco Polo's
talcs. As all of the rest of the early ex
plorers, Cortez did not know that ha was

rreater value than any air line route from

Sir Francis Drake. Not the least
among the romantic deeds of this
man waa his voyage of discovery, which
resulted In his coming perilously near to
the discovery of San Francisco Bay. In
the year 1577 the gallant captain sailed
up the Mexican coast, sacking towns as
he passed, until he was caught In the grip
of adverse winds and carried far to the
north out of his course. Sighting some
lofty white cliffs In the latitude of 83
degrees, Drake made a landing In the bay
which now bears his name, a few miles
to the north of the Golden Gate. From
the description of the cliffs In his chron
icles of the voyage and from the fact that
no mention was made of a magnificent
harbor, such as he surely would have
noted had he entered San Francisco Bay,
thÂ« deduction Is nearly authoritative that
Juan Rodriguez Cabrilfo claims for rtself
the success of having located the out
lines of California's coast. On the 27th
of June, 1542. he sailed from the port of
Navidad. He first entered San Diego Bay
which he named San Miguel. After pay-
Ing a visit to the Santa Catalina islands,
he continued northward, through Santa
Barbara channel, until he entered the bay
of Monterey. Pressing still northward,
he passed the outlet of San Francisco
Bay without seeing it and went as far
north as Cape Mendoclno, which, accord-
Ing to the chronicles of the Monk Vene
gas, he named in honor of the Viceroy
of 6paln, Mendoza. Returning to Mex
ico, Cabrlllo announced in glowing phrase
the discovery of the magnificent harbor
of Monterey, which he said would hold

and entrench themselves. Two of tae

dle without a taste of food
Fremont, with fourteen men, raced
back to Gillesple's camp, reaching there
in the nick of time. Within three hours
of their arrival the Indians closed in on
the white men and were repulsed only
after a fierce -struggle, in which two of
Fremont's men were killed. But Gilles
ple's message from Washington was de
livered, and although its Import can only
be guessed at, Fremont set off at top
speed for the settlements in California.
Events now moved with a rush. To Fre
mont, encamped the â¢ Maryavilie
Buttes, the rumor * 3 brought that Gen
eral Castro had Issued an edict condemn-
Ing to destruction all Americans Cali
fornia unless they quit the country. It
was even said that Castro was advancing
to attack Fremont with 300 armed and
mounted men. , Panic spread throughout
the thinly settled country. An Ameri
cans for 150 miles- about, fearing for their
lives, began to collect at'Fremont's camp.
Events proved that ' t~e rumors were
groundless, but the iron was hot and the
blow, was struck.
Bear Flag Triumphantly
Waves Over Mexican
Fort at Sonoma. ,,
y* ROM a Mexican woman's babble to
ri her husband the news reached Fre
â¢* . mont's camp that a certain Cali
fornlan, Lieutenant Arce, was driving
a band of horses from the Interior
to Castro's headquarters . In the Santa.
Clara Valley. Fired by some unknown
impulse, the result, doubtless, of the
war spirit which was rife, fourteen
young men rode and Inter
cepted Arce, captured his band of horses
agd returned with them to Fremont. The
Bear Flag revolution was begun.
Fiercely burned the spirit of revolt. On
the morning , of June 12, fifteen men, in
cluding the number who had engaged in
the raid on the horses and under the
command of "Stuttering" Merritt, drove
post haste, to Sonoma, the residence of
General Mariano Vallejo. By the time
the Bear Flag Independents arrived at
Sonoma at midnight of June 14. their
company had swelled in numbers to
thirty-two. Merritt, leader of the party,
and Dr. Semple of Sacramento were dele
gated to wake up the comandante. Gen
eral Vallejo, and tell him that he was
under arrest. With Vallejo, his brother,
Salvador, Victor Prudon, and an Ameri
can, Jacob P. Leese, son-in-law of Gen
eral Vallejo, were also captured In this
somewhat unromantic fashion.
The prisoners were sent off to Butter's
Fort and the revolting settlers proceeded
to take possession. They were now
both horse thieves and revolutionists;
they had stolen government property and
captured a government official; plainly It
was expedient to create themselves into
a government.
Forthwith a . somewhat grandiloquent
declaration of Independence from the
hand of one, William B. Ide, the self-ap
pointed leader of the Independents, was
announced. Then by the clumsy hand" of
men rv no rigurea rrominentiy in tne Conquest of Cslifornta.
TiJT EANWHILE a fortuitous, some
/n^ even claim a skillfully planned,
â¢* ' succor was brought to Fremont
and the Independents in the form
of the arrival of Commodore S'.oat
of the United States navy in Mon
terey Bay on the second day of
July. Acting on the orders of Secre
tary of the Navy Bancroft, Sloat had
stationed himself at Mazatlan to await
the news of the declaration of war be
tween the United States and Mexico, with
the understanding that upon that event
he was to sail immediately for Califor
nia and hoist the flag at herÂ«capital. The
undoubted intention of England was to
await the same event and then declare
California under British protection.. To
that end Admiral Seymour of the British
Pacific squadron was stationed at Mazat
lan also, in the man-of-war Collingwood.
Like rival hounds straining at the
leash to be first at the prey, the two com
manders lay at anchor In the southern
port ready for the race to the waters of
California. On May 13 war was declared
and Secretary Bancroft sped a message
to Commodore Sloat. On June 8 Sloat
received the message and was away, with
the English admiral after him. On July
7 he raised the Stars and Stripes at Mon
terey just after Seymour had dropped
anchor in the same bay. The race and
undoubtedly the country was therefore
lost by England.
Swiftly but surely the comparatively
bloodless conquest of California waa
now undertaken. Owing to ill-health
Commodore Sloat resigned the command
to Commodore Robert F. Stockton, who
had come into Monterey on the frigate
Congress. To him Fremont reported with
his riflemen and ex-Independents and by
Stockton was created major of the band,
which was known as the California Bat
talion. Stockton abandoned the project
entertained by Sloat of making terms
with Pico and Castro and determined to
'compel their surrender by force of arms.

After an Ineffectual pursuit of General

with executing Jose Berryessa and Ra

leged spies, and returned to his camp on

Starry Banner Unfurled
and War of Conquest
Is Commenced.
But sentiment In the United States soon
suffered a serious change. In 2S44 Louis
Philippe, then King of France, published
a programme for converting Mexico and
her Calif ornias into an empire, either di
rectly under French control or subject to
French influence. He urged this measure.
"This Republic- (meaning the United
States) should have limits. The present
occasion does not require me to say
where these limits should be found on
the north and south: but westward we
can speak without reserve, and the ridges
of the Rocky Mountains may be named
without offense as presenting a conven
ient, natural and everlasting: boundary."
/N our Congress the early sentiment
was that the great west was as
useless as the wilds of Patagonia
and that the United States had no
concern with the other rim of an
unexplored continent, barred from civ
ilization by - the snowy bulwark -of
the Rockies. A party favored the
establishment of a new American re
public in the West, distinctly separated
from the United States and useful only as
a checkmate to the hostile schemes -of
Great Britefn. j A epeech of Senator Ben
ton of Missouri, made In support of this
measure .iaUSS, shows what sentiment
existed against California at that time.
Speaking of the projected Western re
public .he said: â¢ - - - '' Â¦;"-*
The brief years between the accession
of Mexican supremacy over California
and the treaty which confirmed to the
United States the possession of that which
she already held in her grasp are more
crowded with Incident than any other
era of California's history. In those years
there f>Â«fell the armed disputes between
the Mexican rulers of the soil, which can
sca:ce be dignified by the name of -wars;
the remarkable Bear Flag revolution fol
lowed, and then the conquest of Cali
fornia by Fremont, Kearny and Stockton.
The subsequent discovery of gold and the
mad rush to "the newly acquired territory
put California in the position to leap full
fle-dged Into the sisterhood of the Union.
Of little Interest to tTiose who are not
historical grubbers and book worms is
the recital of the dreary succession cf

Mexican rule from the time of the acces

to the days of Pio Pico, the last of the
Mexican rulers, who took his seat in Feb

were battles, so called, the unseating of
those In high places and the consequent
gradual alltnation/of <he Department of
California from the tottering home gov
ernment in Mexico. So far did the Cali
fornians go in their disloyalty to the cen
tral authority that in November, 1S36, the
Territorial Legislature declared California
to be a free and independent sovereign

began to form the chief subject <K strat

jealousy and distrust of one another at
first prompted the three nations concerned
to take good care that the disputed

When the Californians began to become
restive under the rule of Mexico, In tli*

Americans in the country who were cal

ward annexation by the United States.
Thomas O. Larkin, residing at Monterey
as the United States Consul, did much to
foster a kindly sentiment toward his Gov
ernment and kept the officials at Wash
ington constantly apprised as to the trend
of events. Largely by his influence and
that of other Americans the Departmental
Assembly of California decided In 1S46
upon a united council of the pueblos of
California to determine upon the advisa
bility of annexation to some foreign pow
er. Speeches were made In favor of union
with the United States, but no definite
action was taken.

States. John C Fremont, then a captain
in the United States engineering corps,
made a trip of exploration to California in

upon his daring adventures on mountain
and desert, Fremont" returned to Califor

The scene of the international drama
now shifts to California, where the in
trepid American settlers were to play the
prologue to the swiftly moving spectacle
which was to result In the raising of the
banner of the United States over a vast
and immensely wealthy country.
From the days when the cautious Span
ish Governor warned the comandante at
San Francisco Presidio against the incur
sions of Americans, a constantly increas
ing stream of settlers from Eastern states
began to come over the mountains and
settle in the fertile valleys of California-
Captain John A. Sutter, t Swiss emigrant,
received in 1S41 from the Mexican Gov
ernor a land grant of eleven square
leagues near the junction of the American
and Sacramento rivers, built a fort there
on and was made a commander under the
Mexican Government. Sutler's fort be
came thenceforward the central point for
the colonization movements by -the Amer
icans.
bo faithfully copied afterward by Louis
Napoleon, as a check to the threatened
aggrandizement of Great Britain or the
United States by the seizure of California.
This move on the part of France, coupled
with a growing fear that, chagrined at the
loss of Oregon, Great Britain would
pounce upon California, led the adminis
tration of President Tyler to take steps
t/> force the game. During the twelve or
fifteen years previous to the outbreak of
the Mexican War, the conviction that the
United States wanted California had been
ripening- to a general demand on the part
of the "spreadeag'.e" party. The acquisi.
tion of our State was not an accident of
the war, but the result of a plan long
matured and persistently followed.
Before Fremont could arrive on the
scene in answer to an urgent call from
the Independents, the only battle of the
Bear Flag Republic had taken place.
Two men. Cowle and Fowler, sent on a
mission to Russian River to obtain pow
der, fell into the hands of the Cahfornlans

three of the Independents, under com
mand of W.I* Ford, surprised the force
of Captain Joaquln de la Torre near San
Rafael. A battle ensued In which the
Independents slew eight of their adver
saries and retreated unscathed to Sono

capitulation of Glllesple. Santa Barbara
was likewise quickly recaptured and the
whole south waa aflame with rebellion.
A messenger, spurring his Jaded steeds
all the way from Los Angeles to Son
Francisco without a day's rest, brought
the news of the uprfaing to Commodore
Stockton. Opposed to the pitiful hand
ful of men left to garrison the southern
cities were from 1200 to 1400 armed and
mounted Californians. who were now
complete masters of the country which
had seemed to be eo easily subdued.
Stockton and Fremont were a thousand

East the new Territory of Calif ornU
teemed lost to the Union.

promptness and daring. Stockton Im

tide until he could appear on the scene

Santa Barbara with 160 hastily enlisted
troops, while Stockton himself set out for

Monterey for more men. After a trying

men, again took possession of Santa Bar

Stockton, meanwhile, had proceeded to
San Diego, built a temporary fort and
was anxiously awaiting relief from Fre
mont. Help from an unexpected quarter
came to him In the person of General Ste
phen "\V. Kcarny, who, having completed
the subjugation of New Mexico, had
pushed on to California with a small
force to assist in its conquest. Learning
of the state of affairs, Kearny had sent
word to Stockton In San Diego that he
wished to effect a junction with him.
Meeting Giliespie and a small force which
Stockton had sent out to him, Kearny
engaged the Camornians at San Pasqual,
near San Diego, with disastrous results
and had to be rescued from his perilous
position by a second relief force from
Stockton.
With their combined forces of about 600
men, Stockton and Kearny set out for
Los Angeles. But near San Gabriel on
January 8, 1S47. they engaged In the final
and most serious battle of the war In
California. The enemy with 600 mounted
men and four field pieces attacked the
American force with all the despairing
energy of a dying cause. Again and
again the beautifully mounted and ut
terly fearless vaqueros charged the
American squares, only to be mowed
down by the steady, galling flre of the
trained marksmen. At last the Callfor

reinforcements, and to him surrendered

articles of capitulation at the Rancho da

17The committee continued in its work,
driving gamblers out of the city and de
porting boodlers; when they came Into
clash with Governor John N. Johnson,
who ordered Major General William T.
Sherman to use the militia of San Fran
cisco to put down the Vigilance Commit
tee as participators in armed sedition.
Sherman resigned rather than execute
his orders. The frantic Johnson then
petitioned President Pierce to use- tha
military and naval forces of the United
States to put down what he termed a re
bellion, but his application was denied.
Meanwhile the Vigilantes, behind their
"Fort Gunnybags," were continuing their
perfect military organization, even pre

On August 18, after a remarkable career
in purging the city of crime, the Vigil

appreciation accorded It by the citizens,
that the dissolution partook of the nature
of a triumphal public precession. Thus
pasted Into history that remarkable or
ganization which upheld the law and
maintained order while itself technically
a lawless body.
The great stress of the Civil War which
racked the States east of the Rockies in
the throes of internecine bloodshed
scarcely affected California. Our land was
then too remote to hear, except in soft

Immediately & crowd of exasperated cit

In a hall on Sacramento street, near

a brass cannon pointed at the door, de

Casey, together with Charles Cora, who
had murdered United State* Marshal
Richardson, was delivered over to the
Vigilantes and uy them taken to the head

the railroad, while in San Francisco bald
faced corruption was rampant. Juries
were weak, judges weaker, and it be
came a proverb that one might safely
commit a murder if he took the advice of
the best lawyers.
Things had reached this pass when a
mass-meetlnff held In San Francisco in
the fall of '77 for the purpose of express
ing sympathy for the striking railroad
employes at Pittsburgh Pa,, developed into
j a demonstration against the Chlneso,
which looked for a time like a general at
tack on Chinatown 1 . Out of this first rath
er aimless demonstration was born tha
Sand Lot party, with Denis Kearney at
its head. Kearney, who was a power in
the Draymen's Union at the time,-em
braced the opportunity offered by the Sep

Congressional officers to call a meeting of
workingmen and malcontents with a view
to forming a permanent organization for

Upon the sand lot where the City Hall
now stands and where only the Hall of
Records had been completed, Kearney and
his rapidly growing band ; of agitators
were wont to hold monstrous open-air
meetings, whereat the speeches both of
Kearney and his fellow workers took a
more and more turbulent character. At
one night meeting held on Nob Hill
Kearney delivered himself of the opinion
that the millionaire railroad magnates
living thereon deserved to have their
houses burtied, whereat he was arrested.
But being released, Kearney became tha
hero of the masses and his Worklngman's

Wherever Kearney spoke he decreed that

The Vigilance Committees of 1851 and
1856 were born of the urgent necessities
of the times. Within a year after the
discovery of gold San Francisco became
a hell hole of robbers, gamblers, political
sharpers and murderers. From the Aus
tralian penal colonies, from the flotsam
of Eastern and European cities there
poured Into the new city an ever increas

feeble municipal government was unable
to cope with them. Emboldened by their

ON June 10 John Jenkins was appre
hended by the Vigilantes for rob
bing a store. He was tried that
night, condemned and hanged in Ports
mouth Square at 2 o'clock next morn-
ing. On July 11 James Stuart was
hanged on Market-street wharf. On
August 24 thirty-six armed Vigilantes
broke into the Jail, recaptured ' two
prisoners who had been taken from
them by the Sheriff and hanged them from
the eaves of their own headquarters.
Upon Incriminating findings of Coroner's
juries in the instances of these hangings,
the Vigilance Committee boldly issued a
proclamation, stating their reasons for
action and signed by all of the members.
No steps were taken against them by the
authorities and they continued their ex
istence until the reign of lawlessness had
been checked, when they adjourned to
meet again if necessary:
The second' Vigilance Committee of 1856
was called into action largely by the aw
ful corruption existing in the city gov
ernment and the consequent utter'paral
ysis of justice. In municipal elections
clubs were openly formed for the purpose
of trafficking in votes. The so-called
"double, improved, back-action Â« ballot
boxes" served to elect scamps and bood
lers into rich offices of "political graft.
Judges and Juries were either bought or
"instructed" by a higher power. San
Francisco municipal government \. had
sunk to its. lowest ebb. .. "
. The crisis was precipitated by the as
sassination of James King of William,
which she sent back to the Impoverished
treasury at Washington did much to fur
nish the sinews of war for the North.
Close upon the reign of peace came an
event which was fraught with much
significance to California. The iron
ribbons of the Central Pacific, which
had been stretching toward one another
from the East and the West, were at last
joined in May, 1863, at Promentory Point,
Utah.
This was the bond which cemented the
far distant commonwealth on the Pacific
to the East and made California a power
in the Union rather than the isolated em
pire which she had been. With the open
ing of traffic and the contemporaneous
discovery that gold could also be found
in orchard and wheat field as well as in
mountain, the young giant on the western
sea leaped into his manhood by a mar
velous growth.
The "Great Bonanza" excitement of the
early'70's had introduced among all classes
a widespread; mania for stock gambling.
The millionaire on Nob Hill and the hos
tler in his stable alike invested their
money in wildcat schemes. But in 1S77
the wave of hard times from the East
struck California and the bubble of false
wealth was instantly pricked. The
moneyed kings could stand the crash, but
the farmer, the poorly paid store clerk
and mechanic felt the pinch severely. The
farmer claimed that the great railroad
system which controlled the State was
wringing his sustenance from him. The
great army of unemployed which collect
ed at San Francisco demanded that
somebody give them work. Everywhere
the Chinese were working for wages
-which were impossible as far as -white
labor was ! concerned.
Another undoubted evil existed In the
wholesale corruption which had honey

ure by a small majority. This done, they
proceeded to elect a Legislature to put
the instrument into effect, but a reaction
set in against their propaganda, and when
that body met a strong conservative ele
ment passed statutes which gave effect to
the provisions of the constitution in a
form far less harmful than was expected.
The Sand Lot party then gradually sank
into insignificance and finally disappeared.
Of the history of California during the
last twenty-five years there is much that
can be written in the future when the
lapse of time has thrown events Into a
proper historical perspective. Much that
ha3 happened and is happening, savors
now cf personal or party prejudice and
cannct be dwelt UDon until the passage
of years makes It pure history.
Now at the fifty-third anniversary, of
the birth of our State we have tne oppor
tunity to pause and reflect on the future.
Consider how, up to fifty years ago, Cali
fornia dreamed away her daya la luxur
ious indolence, contented to bask lazily
in the glad sunshine of. har own skies.
Then, as If by the touch of a magician's
wand, she roused herself to unceasing
energy. The wealth of mine and flald
which had lain hidden for centuries wÂ«Â«
brought to light. A stable commonwealth
was built out of the exigencies of tr.a
moment. A hardy race of men was
tamed to the task of upbuilding an em
pire. Peace was established where dis
order reigned. The new State was raised
to be a leader among her sisters of tno
American Union.
Now stands California on the edge of
the continent with her eyes to the West,
whither ever the touch of destiny has led
the American people. California has
ceased to be the frontier; that has been
moved to lands below the sweep of the
horizon. Instead California stands as the
keystone of the arch of American empire
which springs from Porto Rico to Luzon.
Such desperate condition of public senti
ment was due entirely to the unparalleled
situation in which California found her
self during the years of '49 and '50. By
the end of '49 there were 100,000 people In
the territory and yet there was absolute
ly no system of judicial procedure for
their governance nor yet any legal status
given to the territory by Congress. Since
peace had been made with Mexico In '48
there could be no shadow of authority in
military rule, according to the conception
of the majority of settlers, and since Con
gress had provided no civil government,
the territory was practically In a state of
anarchy. With hundreds of murderers,
blacklegs and unscrupulous politicians in
the new country, with the small military
organization powerless to inaugurate ac
tion and to pursue it if inaugurated, cer
tainly no state or territory of the Union
was ever in a position so perilous. But
rHK double stream of humanity
pouring in from ship and trail
dissipated itself in a thousand
branching channels among the gulches
and canyons cf the Sierras. Towns
with unspeakable names sprang up
like mushrooms along the length of
the gold fields. Rough manners and
a rougher Justice were their charac
teristic*. There were no courts of law;
each man was unto himself a court
of first instance and of final appeal. The
time was even seen when it was a mooted
question whether or not murder was a
crime or even if there was any such thing
as crime.

The expense and the discomforts of the
Panama route to San Francisco impelled
most of the argonauts from the Middle
West to cross the plains. The story of
the great migrations across the parched
sands of the desert, through the midst
of cruel and vengeful Indians, and over
the snowy crest of the Sierras, will never
be fully told. Many a hidden skull is
there along the length of the old Cali
fornia trail, whose cleft crown could add
its mute testimony to the harrowing tales
of bloodshed. Many a bleached bone,
hidden in the blown sands of the desert,
bespeaks the last agony of some thirst
rfdden wretch.

trade. Those merchants who had re

The convention drew up a constitution
modeled on the plan of that of Iowa and
submitted it to the vote of the people on
November 13, 1S49, by whom it was ratl-
lied. At the first election, Burnett was
elected Governor, General Fremont and
W. M. Gwinn being chosen as delegates
to Congress. On February 13, 1850, Presi-
dent Fillmore presented California's
petition for Statehood to Congress. This
occasioned a great deal more hesitation
and sparring on the part of the two fac-
tlons until at last Henry Clay's famous
"Omnlbus Bill," which Included among
its compromises the admission of Callfor-
nia, passed through Congress on Septem-
ber 7 and was signed by the President two
days afterward. Thus on September 9,
1850, did California become the thirty-first
star on the escutcheon of the Union.
The Monterey convention, which draft-
ed the first constitution of California, also
selected the great seal of the State. The
story of the selection contains some odd
features and deserves mention.

was in session. Major Robert S. Garnett,

erection of State buildings. This munifi

act passed to submit the selection of a
site at the next general election. Vallejo
was the place chosen by the suffrage of
the voters.
When the time for the next session of
the Legislature drew nigh, General Val
lejo had so far failed to keep his promise
that preparations for the reception of the

session was marked by a scarcity of food
and the total absence of a washerwoman.

grounds that the bear appeared to be

M M Jder consideration, a brief history
of the peregrinations of the State
capital may be noted at 'this point.
Monterey had always been the seat
of the Spanish and Mexican gov
ernments, and was naturally chosen as
the first capital of California. At tho
very first meeting of the Constitutional
Assembly, San Joke and San Francisco
put in a bid for the location of the eeat of
government. San Jose won out, and the
first Legis'.ature met there in December,
1849. But this town was not destined to
hold the honor long, for General Vallejo

never was the Innate American genius
for self-government better shown as In
the action which was taken by the set
tlers to effect for themselves what Con
gress neglected to provide for them.
When !n May, 1S49. Ceneral Riley suc
ceeded Colonel Mason as military gov
ernor of the Territory of California he
found a people clamoring for some form
of civil government. They maintained
that he was merely an usurper since the
close of the Mexican war had deprived
the military governor of his legal pow
ers. They declared that under the Con
stitution they had a right to meet and
legislate for themselves since Congress
had provided no Territorial form of gov
ernment. Governor Riley held that the
old Mexican laws of California, such as
they were, must be enforced until action
by Congress and that no initiative on the
part of the people was possible.
The secret of the trouble lay in the
great question, then agitating Congress,
of whether or not the vast extent of terri
tory wrested from Mexico should be free
or open to slavery. President Polk in
giving instructions of one character to
Governor Riley and expressing different
sentiments In his message, was but fol
lowing the precedent of the time, which
was one of hesitancy and Indecision. The
slavery and anti-slavery parties in Con
gress were fighting a death struggle in
which both factions were so evenly
matched that a deadlock ensued and Cali
fornia was the sufferer thereby. Such
master minds as thoee of Webster, Cal

way or the other.

GROWTH OF THE WESTERN GIANT
18themselves to realize that the men who
flocked to California in '49 and subse
quently were the ones who did real yeo
man work in laying the foundations of the
great commonwealth and that it would be
the later Influx of settlers who would far
outshadow the few who had come before
in the light of subsequent history.
After much opposition, the early settlers
at last gave way and in July, 1853, the
constitution was so amended that all
those who had come to California prior to
January 1, 1S50, could be admitted Into the
society. But the distinction yet remained
that the early settlers, or those who had
come to the West before '49, should con
stitute a class, with class privileges. As
a result of the removal of the barrier
against the men of '49 the membership of
the society was doubled before the end of
the year.
Daring Vigilantes Led by
William T. Coleman
Against Crime.
THE part played by the Pioneers in
the social life of the fifties cannot
be overestimated. In those days of
restless money getting, when San
Francisco was, at its best, a very
poor place in which to live,
when gamblers and murderers elbowed
respectable citizens into the gutters, and
crime in all its hideous shapes, was rife,
the fraternal spirit of the society acted as
a counter-irritant to the demoralizing in
fluences of the time. To the man, wearied
by the hurry and confusion of early San
Francisco life and sick for the noble com
radeship of a good man the society of
fered the safest refuge. . While gambling
dens and dance balls were nightly offer
ing their tawdry attractions to the young
man, wearied by the day's tail, the rooms
of the society were the only 'safe haven.

J. C. L. Wadsworth; corresponding sec
retary, Edwin Bryant. To realize the
part which these men played in the early
history of California we have only to re
flect that the names of four of them have
been perpetuated by being applied to four
of the streets of San Francisco. Bry
ant afterward became the author of one
of the earliest books on California life,
entitled "What I Saw In California."
From its very inception the society
came to command the respect and honor
of all. In the monster procession which
was held to celebrate the news of the re
ception of California into the Union, Colo
nel Stevenson, the grand marshal, placed
the Pioneers In the fore-front of the line.
Again, at the occasion of its first public
celebration, the society marched through
the streets and afterward kept open
house, entertaining State and city digni
taries with a lavish hand. Well could the
society claim for itself pre-eminence at
that time. Among 1 the first members_were
the following noted men in subsequent his
tory: General Henry W. Halleck, Gen
eral William T. Sherman, General John C.
Fremont, General John W. Geary, General
George A. Stoneman, General Henry M.
Naglee, General Joseph Hooker, Commo
dore Robert F. Stockton,* Commodore Sel
fridgeâall men who either had become
famous or were destined to achieve great
mark in the Civil War.
As the society grew older, it began to
become evident that if its membership
were confined strictly to the men who
came to California before 1849 it would
soon cease altogether, so the movement
to Incorporate members who were in the
land of gold before California was admit
ted to the Union began to be agitated.
Strange to us of the present day appears
the jealousy which was maintained by the
first settlers against the argonauts. In
their narrowness they could not bring

*Â«"^UT for the first Inspiration of the
A^ Bociety we must look farther back
J*J than the days of gold; we
must consider the very first pio
neers who drifted down upon Cal
ifornia when it was yet a dreamy
pravlnce of old Mexico. Before '43 there
were stirring events which tended to weld
the first American settlers Into a compact
body with a common cause and common
needs. In the days of the Bear Flag revo
lu'.ion at Sonoma, which are touched upon
in another part of this paper, and in the
fierce heat of the ensuing conquest of
California by General John C. Fremont
and .ommodore R- F. Stockton, the men
banded together in support of their new
homes and their mother country far over
the mountains sowed the seed from which
was to cpring the great society. To the
very earliest blood of the society, organ
lz< i by these earliest settlers, there was
infused the new stock of the argonauts.
From these two branches sprang the or
pnnization which was to do so much in
support of the patriotic sentiments of
the later generationâ the native children
of California.
Among those who were the very earliest
Fettlers in the territory of California were
two who did much to inaugurate the so
ciety, Samuel Brannan and Colonel Jona
than D. Stevenson. Brannan had come
around the Horn in 1846 with the Mormon
colony which had Intended to find In Cali
fornia an abiding place for the Saints, so
recently driven out of their city of Nau
voo. Illinois. The Mormons found that
the settlers from the East had already
pre-empted the country, but they made
the best of It and stayed in the new ter-
Thus, with their work wel' established,
the Pioneers who yet remain look back
upon that which has been of their doing
and justly feel that they have tried to
perform their full measure of private
duty and oubllc benefaction, and leave
a fair measure of good to the new Cali
fornia whose growth has been so greatly
stimulated by. their effort*,
and have to call upon the assistance of
their brothers. As an example of what
Is done by the relief fund the figures of
disbursements for'the last two years
may be cited.
The total disbursements for relief In
1901-02 were $10,234. equal to an average
payment of JS55. For 1902-03 thÂ» total
relief offered amounted to $11,320 90, mak
ing an average monthly payment of 1344.
Forty-seven worthy beneficiaries claimed
assistance in 1901-02, and In the succeed
ing year the number was forty.
The finances of the Pioneers, thanks
to the generosity of James Lick and the
perfect management of the funds since
the time of the society's lnceotlon. are
In such a condition as to warrant the gen
erous assistance given members in dis
tress. As the result of wisely invested In
terests, the assets of the society were
valued at $335,843 06 at the last report of
the treasurer. With such a firm founda
tion, the organization Is In a position to
rival many benevolent and fraternal so
cieties with far greater membership.

Commodore Stockton's proclamation
upon the raising of the Stars

is also among the relics treas
ured by the Pioneers. There are
clippings from old newspapers announc
ing the sailing of steamers to the land of
gold, faded pictures of familiar scenes in
the early history of the city, the bell of
the Monumental Fire Company, which,
used to sound the alarms of the Vigi
lantes, and even the battered plug hat
and rusty sword of "Norton, Emperor by
the grace of God." A visit to Pioneer
Hall Is in itself a full course in the his
tory of our State.
completion of the new structure, the so
ciety entered Into its new home with one
of the most brilliant social functions of
the year. The first important step which
was made after the new building had
been put into use was the creation of a
relief fund. Already some of the earlier
members were becoming infirm with age
and many were broken in fortune. With
the generous gift of 1500, made by Rob
ert J. Tiffany, the relief fund soon grew
to the $10,000 mark and since that time
has been kept at that sum, notwithstand
ing the many deeds of charity which have
been done by the society for the benefit
of needy members.
On October 3. 1S73. Lick made another
generous gift to the society of which ; he
was an enthusiastic rr-ember. This was
a deed to the magnificent site where Pio
neer Hall now stands on the corner of
Fourth and Stevenson streets. Lick had
desired that his name and the fame of
the organization should be perpetuated
by a building which should be a lasting
monument to both. In September,
1S73, Lick made the Pioneers one of his
residuary legatees In the deed of trust
through which the final disposition of his
great estate was to be made. By these
two benefices that capitalist and philan
thropist put the Society of California
Pioneers in the position of being one of
the richest social organizations of the
State.
Housed in Magnificent
Quarters, Destiny Is
Fulfilled.
Y ICK died on September 30, 1876.
/ and great trouble was destined to
J-^ surround the munificent gift which
he had made before the society could
derive any benefit therefrom. When
In 18S2 the society had not yet
received Its benefice from the "Lick
Trust,", which was closing up the es
tate, a committee was appointed to in
vestigate the affairs of the executors and
report to the society. This committee
made some sensational charges against
the executors of the estate and a remark
able degree of excitement was aroused
both in the society and by the public
press. * But it was fairly shown to the
society that all the time that the Lick
benefice was tied up in the estate It was
gathering larger and larger accretions of
wealth. When the" estate was finally set
tled in 1S0C, the cash benefit to the so
ciety amounted to JG04.65J OS.
Before the Lick estate had been di
vided, the agitation for a . new Pioneer
Hall, to be erected on the lot which Lick
had presented to the society in 1873. was
commenced. After considerable opposi
tion, a permanent building committee was
selected and after first relncorporatlng
under, the new constitution, work upon
the present structure, was commenced.
The cornerstone was laid on September
7, 1S84. and in due season the society en
tered into its^ permanent home. Since
that time the old Pioneers have been loy
ally standing shoulder to shoulder, clos
ing the gaps as they are made by the
hand of the reaper and resolutely foster
ing the same old spirit which obtained
when first the young Pioneers marched
at the head of the procession on the first
Admission Day celebration.
The purposes for which the Society of
California> Pioneers was formed and is
maintained are thus succinctly stated In
its constitution:
"The society is designed to be a moral,
should take a number and thus sink his
personality for the sake of the secrecy
necessary to successfully carry on the
work which had to be done. >
Immediately the question arose: "Who
shall be number one?" At once Coleman
-was singled out by his associates. Cole
man vainly tried to refuse, but at last
was forced to acquiesce. Thus was the
strength of the Pioneers represented in
"No. 1" of the famous Vigilance Com
mittee of "56.
At this time a man was elevated to the
presidency of the society whose name is
Inseparable from the early history of
California. This was Thomas O. Larkln.
He had come to Monterey in 1S32, being
therefore one of the very first Americans
to settle in California. As consular agent
of the United States during the time when
our Government was making manifest
plans to lay hold of the western coast, he
did much. He was a worthy representa
tive of the old order of things among the
pioneers.
During Larkin's presidency the entire
board of directors was made up of forty,
niners, he being the sole representative of
the old conservative first settlers. From
this time forward, the younger branch of
the society remained in control almost to
the total exclusion of the old guard.
The first headquarters of the society
were In the old Bella Union building, on
Washington street, near Kearny. This
was then the center of the business dis
trict of the city, and the building in
which the Pioneers lodged was considered
a remarkably fine one. In 1860, however,
James Lick made his first gift to the so
ciety in the form of a lot on Montgomery
street, near Pacific, where now can be
still seen a dingy old hall, at present the
headquarters of a livery stable, with the
legend, Pioneers, across its stone front.
As a result of one of San Francisco's
great .fires, , which ruined hundreds and
paralyzed business temporarily, the So
ciety of -California Pioneers languished
during the early '60's. But through the
earnest endeavors of O. P. Sutton, Wll
lard B. Farwell and William R. Wheaton,
interest was revived in 1S62. By the plan
of having numerous individuals take out
life memberships, a fund of $3000 toward
the erection of the building upon the lot
donated by Lick was accumulated.

rllE society was then forced to de
vise means for placing a mortgage
on its property in order that
more building funds could be raised.
No sufficient authority for such ac
tion being vested in the officers,
it became necessary to have an act
passed by the Legislature bestowing upon
the president, ' secretary and board of di
rectors the necessary authority for such
a step. Wlllard B. Farwell, who was at
this time one of those most active in com
pleting the reorganization of the society,
' secured the passage of the act, and the
mortgage was given. To provide against
possible contingencies of a like nature,
the society drew up articles of Incorpora
tion and on January 28, 1S63, they were
filed and the organization thus started on
a firm legal basis. â¢". - rt â¢

It was at this meeting at an Iron ware
house on Montgomery street then, that
the California Society of Pioneers was or
ganized. On September 27, when the con
stitution and by-laws had been drawn up,
the announcement of the existence of the
rocie-ty was made in the morning papers.
The Herald commented upon the an
nouncement in the following editorial:
"We have seen no movement In our
midst so fraught with interest as the
formation of the California Society of
Pioneers. Most of our readers are proba

Uie "California Star." and through Its
columns did much to bring California be

friend and co-worker. Colonel Stevenson,
had come across the continent with the
famous Stevenson regiment just at the
close of the Mexican War and had set

later a prominent figure in the early his

The steamship California, which ar
rived at San Francisco on August 23. 1850,
brought news of the death of President
Taylor. By W. D. M. Howard, J. C. I*
Wadpworth and Brannan it was proposed
to call together all of the "old residents"
of the vicinity to pay due respect to hia
memory. This call did not include any
of the argonauts who had come in '49, for
the earlier pioneers were very jealous of
their distinction as such and looked upon
the men of the gold rush, if not In th*
light of intruders, certainly not worthy
of the titles of pioneers. Accordingly the
following notice appeared in Brannan's
paper of August 30:
"The early pioneers of California are-

When In the fevered days of the gold
rush, men poured into California through
every mountain pass end on every in
coming vessel, there was born In them
a generous spirit of fellowship and rough
fraternal affection. The perils of the
plains ar.d of the snowy Sierras, the many
hardships of the mining camps where
often men were forced to band themselves
together for protection against lawless
ness, the open handed generosity of those
fortunate ones who found themselves sud
denly made richâ all these influences in
evitably drew men into a closer bond of
fellowship. A mutual pride of the State
was felt among them; a mutual desire
to build well the foundations for the

respect for one another united them.

i THE SAN FKANCJSCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, ~1903.
It was at this period in the .history
of the Pioneers that the sterling
worth of the members of the society
was demonstrated in an hour of nead.
When San Francisco was overrun with
murderers. and blacklegs and justice was
blinded by the machinations of desperate
and unprincipled politicians, the Vigilance
Committee sprang into existence. At its
head was William T. Coleman, a leader
among the Pioneers. Among its members
were numbered over a hundred Pioneers
who enrolled themselves gladly to serve
the city in its hour of need.
In 1851 when the Vigilantes were first
organized, Coleman became a member of
the executive committee. When ' James
Stuart, arrested for the assault committed
upon an innocent' storekeeper, was tried
by the Vigilantes, Coleman acted as pros
ecuting attorney. When the organization
arrested John Jenkins, known as "Sydney
Cove," Samuel Brannan and Coleman
were those most active> in securing for
the prisoner ' fair but speedy justice and
they had their hands on the rope which
swung the guilty man into eternity.
It was at the organization of the second
Vigilance Committee of 1856 that Coleman
and Brannan, together with Major John
W. Geary, all members of the Pioneer So
ciety, figured prominently. The incidents
of the first steps j toward . armed ! protec
tion showed that Coleman and bis asso
ciates were tried men and true. . .
When James King of William was shot
down in cold blood by James P.. Casey,
excitement raged to a fever heat and it

were thousands of youths In the city
at that time who could have attended that

sided, explained that for ever so many
years his mind had been running in the
channel of devising something that would
be a lasting monument to 'perpetuate the
discovery of gold In California, also to
keep alive the memories of the early set
tlers of the Golden State. He said that
he did not know of anything that could
better carry out the object than the for
mation of an order composed of native
sons of the Pacific Coast. That, he
claimed, would be sustained by pride of
parentage and place of nativity, which
would be an Imperishable memento â an
Institution that would last until time shall

have passed and are now enrolled In the
first half century of the history of the land

while It did not dim their ardor In regard
to Admission Day, reduced their activity.
They gladly welcomed in the middle sev
enties that young organization, the
Native Sons of the Golden West, when it
announced that It would willingly relieve
their ancestors of the patriotic duty of
observing the anniversary of the birth of
the State. To thÂ« young men thÂ«
old ones 6aid: "We have done our share
in the development of this glorious land
cf ours, we hope that you will take up
the work where we lay it down, that you
will strive by a!l honorable means to keep
the proud record of the State free from
blemish, that yeu will do all that within
your power lies to keep California one of
the brightest stars in the galaxy of
States, and that you. as an organization,
will never forget to observe the anni
versary of the State in which you were
born. Never forget Admission Day."
Little did the late General A. M. Wlnn.
the founder of the order, dream when
he conceived the idea of having an or
ganization of natives of the Golden State
to instill love of country that the order
which he founded would develop into the
grand institution to which It has grown
and will continue to grow until there shall
float over some public hall in every city,
town, village and hamlet within the
boundaries cf the State a banner bearing

an order originating with Miss Lilly O.
Relchling, one of the daughters of a well
known resident of that place. On the af
ternoon of September 11, 1886. Miss Reich
ling presided over a meeting of about
twenty of her sex, In Pioneer Hall, and
explained her purpose of organizing an
independent order to be known as the
Native Daughters of the Golden West.
After many explanations, it was decided
to start the organisation and the name,
object and membership were set forth in
the constitution that was subsequently
prepared, subject to approval.
It declared that: "This organization
shall be known as Ursula Parlor No. 1,
N. D. G. W. Its objects are social inter
course, mental improvement and the gen
eral promotion of the interest of the mem
bers. Membership in this organization
shall be limited to white females who
were born in the State of California since
July 7. 184Â«." Those present, besides the
founder of the order, signed the roll in
the following order: Ellen Boarman.
Maggie StaBal, Rose Staaal, Nellie Fon
tenrose, Emma Boarman, Mrs. Amy Ba
dere. Kittle Murray, Agnes Leonard,
Celia Murray, Hettie Greenhalgh, Flora
Â¦ Dunning and Rose Genaro. Strange as
it may seem, Miss Reichlfng, who had
been working for many months to effect
such an organization, was not the first
but the tenth to sign the list. At the
second meeting the list was added to by
the signatures of the following named:
Ella Caminetti, Tina L. Kane, Olga
Relchling, Mollle Folger, Mattie L. Free

The exclusively Callfornian organiza
tion known as the Native Daughters of
the Golden West, which is in a great
measure patterned upon the lines of the
Native Sons, has not, like the former or
ganization, taken the same activity in
the celebration of the anniversary of
California's admission into the Union.
Its fundamental principles are: social
intercourse, mental improvement and
mutual benefit; the uniform administra
tion of the rights and privileges of. tho
Order of the Native Daughters of the
Golden West; perpetuating the memory
of the founders of the State of Califor

socially and materially by encourage
ment when In need, and by providing for
and comforting the sick and distressed
members of the order. Although the
basic law ot this order does not provide
that the members shall hold special ser
vice in honor of the anniversary of the
admission of the State of California, the
members have during the past few years
been asked annually by the Native Sons
to assist in ttie celebrations wherever
held and in many instances parlors of
Daughters have cheerfully responded,
adding much to the beauty of the cele
bration by elaborate display, beautiful
uniforms and pretty faces.

fornia are cemented in a bond of fel
lowship which is calculated to inspire in
them undying love for their order and
the principles for which it stands. Alike
with the Native Sons, the Native Daugh

recognized beginning, have planted their
banner in nearly every town of any con

their growth Is not yet. They Â£orm an

because of benefits that are offered, but
holds within the charmed circle those who
are members, because of the opportunities
that are offered for education, improve

lor has an open meeting for those who are
not members of the organization It does
not take them long to discover that with
the Native Daughters fraternity and Â»o
clabillty go hand In hand and that every
one is ready for pleasure.
The members of tha parlors In Sacra
mento have a project afoot which In
time will surround Sutter's Fort with
great shade trees; those of the San Joa
quin Valley are interesting themselves in
planting trees along the highways for the
comfort of those who have to travel un
der the rays of a scorching sun. The or
der has a relief committee that has done
much to relieve the needs of worthy sis
ters, and In conjunction with that is tha
Native Daughters' Home, which la a place

used to in their own homes, but which
they cannot have in the ordinary hotels.

*+ LTHOUGH at first the Native Sons
M'W' were not inclined to fraternize with
â¢^-* their sister order, these bands of
prejudice have become nearly dissolved.
On every hand the members of the two
patriotic orders assemble in social inter
course, participate in debates and join in
celebrations of national and State holi
days. The two associations have come to
discover that they may be mutually ben

Of late years the efforts of grand offi

State. Several courses of study of
California history have been distributed
to all members. The increase of fraternal
love, one for another; the sinkins of self
for the good of the entire order; the ven

of country, love of home and a patriotic
reverence for the American flagâ these are
their tenets. To those members of t"h?

are many of them) appeals have been
made to instill into the minds of those
whom they teach the value of a knowl
edge of the State in which they live, and

Present Officers of the Grand Parlors
Since the organization of the first Grand
Parlor the order has continued to grow
in number of parlors and members until
It has at this time increased from seven
teen parlors at that time and less than
a thousand members to ninety-seven par
lors with more than 5000 members.
The order has had several constitutions
and the original plan has been expanded
until now it is one of the first class ben
eficial and charitable societies of the
Coast, and the wonder is that its mem
bership Is not double what It now is.
Each of the grand presidents, and there
are on the list many who have proved
themselves most intelligent and capable
women, have done what in their judg
ment was an improvement on the work
of her predecessor. Whatever was done
along that line was for the purpose of
drawing favorable attention to the work
of the organization and to induce the
membership to advance the interests of
the State. '
In following out the suggestions offer
ed by the different presidents, the mem
bers in many sections of the State have
done much to beautify the public places
and many a neglected public park has
been made attractive under the super
vision of the Native Daughters. They
have, In the south particularly, given
much attention to the preservation of
the missions which have fallen Into de
cay; they are also taking an interest In
the proposed restoration of the great
highway .which extended from San Diego
to San Francisco In the days of the
Padres. They have interested themselves
to the extent of getting the people and
officials of the counties through which
the great highway passes to take a deep
concern in the matter.
In addition to this the Native Daugh
ters have devoted much attention in the
work of preventing the total destruction
of California wild flowers. Some say that
this is only a matter of sentiment, and
that the wild flowers will take care of
themselves in the future as they have in
- the past, but It is a noticeable fact that
much : of the most beautiful flora of the
Golden State Is becoming more scarce
every year, and it* is only by planting and
cultivating, as the Native Daughters have
been doing in various sections of tho
. After the" institution of the first nine
parlors, Ursula issued a plan for the for
mation ot a Grand Parlor, and this being
ratified, there was a call for delegates
from the seventeen parlors to assemble
in Pioneer. Hall in San Francisco, July 25,
1887. when the first Grand Parlor was es
tablished.
thirty days had elapsed sixteen additional
names were added to the- list and tho
charter closed, and so it was that the or
der was launched on the fraternal sea to
float or sink.

however, amicably arranged, and every

Aside from the beneficial feature of tha
order, which has been carried on to aid
those in distress, the parlors throughout
the State have been a factor in many so
cial functions and have also been promi
nent In public affairs that redound to the
credit of the State. It was the order of
the Native Sons of the Golden West that
caused that historical landmark, Sutter's
Fort, to be restored; they built a magnifi
cent monument to the memory of Jamea
W. Marshall, the discoverer of gold in this
State; they erected a granite monument
in Sacramento to mark the last resting
place of the founder of the order. The
parlors contributed money to purchase a
home for the widow of General John C.
Fremont, the Pathfinder; they have pre
served Colton Hall, in which the first
constitution of the State was signed, and
the old Custom-house at Monterey. They
are taking an active interest in the pre
servation of many of the historic land
marks of the State. Steps are now being
taken to erect a monument in Nevada
County where the Donner party suffered
starvation In 1846; a memorial window has
been placed at Mare Island to commem
orate the valorous deeds of Commodore
Sloat, who raised the American flag at
Monterey and took possession of Califor
nia in the name of the United States.
They have in contemplation many other
things which will prove it one of the most
progressive organizations in the fraternal
circles on the Pacific Coastâ an organiza

benefit of its members, is keeping faith
with the pioneers of California by helping
to develop the industries of the State and
advancing its interests whenever and
wherever possible. The reception by the

gallant California regiment on its return
from the Philippines, "he celebration of

and the semi-centennial celebration of the

On April 13, 1855, there was incorporated
under the provisions of a legislative act
the College of California, situated In a
grove of trees in the center of the hamlet
of Oakland. Of this infant college Henry
Durant and Martin Kellogg, recent
ly deceased, were the pioneer work
ers. By their indefatigable efforts
the first freshman class was collect
ed and started on Its scholastic career in
the fall of 1859. To the lasting credit of
the few intellectual spirits of the early
days such pressure was by them brought
to bear on the Legislature that finally on
March 23, 1868, a law was passed incor
porating the pioneer College of California
into the State University of California
and there was thereby launched into the
intellectual world of the country a strip
ling which was destined to become a
giant.
At the present day this Institution,
which was inaugurated with slender
funds and classes hardly numbering a
score, is second among American col
leges in point of attendance and ranked
among the six leading universities of the
country on the basis of scholarship. It
comprises in its faculty men who are
known throughout the scholastic world
for their contributions to literature, the
classics and science. One grand old man
of science, Joseph Le Conte, whom death
removed from his labors but\ recently,

even the quaint old mission flavor of Its
architecture, Stanford \ University is an
ideal spot wherein to live the Intellectual
life.
Stanford University was erected and
endowed by the late Senator Leland Stan

Stanford Jr., who had died when on the
threshold of young manhood. In Novem

passed by the Legislature. Immediately
the first of a grand scheme of buildings
was erected and on October L 1891, the
doors of the new university were thrown
open.

still exists as the dominant note of our
strong, clean San Francisco life.
Another feature of our San Francisco
life which has prompted the wondering
comment of our Eastern friends is its in
genuous generosity and good fellowship,
Â¦which is extended to native householder
and traveler alike. The city by the Gold-
en Gate has long been the favored spot
for the assembling of national organiza
tions in convention. Fraternal orders,
Christian societies and business organiza
tions have come here to find a smile, a
wreath of flowers and a hearty welcome
extended to them by San Francisco. Their
stay has been marked by a genuine en
thusiasm on the part of the municipal
bodies and the private citizens, vying, Ihe
one with the other, in their efforts to
spare nothing for the welcome of the vis
itors.
Wooliness Has Departed
With Past Bays and
Culture Reigns.
/F San Francisco can be kind to others
It certainly cannot do too much for its
own. Long will the record live of the
delirium of joy which marked the reception
of the battle-scarred First California Vol
unteers upon their return from Manila.
San Francisco had graciously decked the
guns of every soldier who had embarked
at her shores for wars In distant lands,
but when her own sons returned to her,
laden with honors of battle, she gave her
self over to a welcome such as has never
been accorded any one entering her gates
before.
This spirit of generous good fellowship,
â¢which Is characteristic of all California as
it is of San Francisco, seems to be born
in the blood. Pride of our State, our city,
a desire to show our heaven-cast bless
ings to those whom we consider, less
blessed by nature's bounty â these feel
ings prompt our sentiments in a measure.
But there is behind it all the spirit of- the
old argonauts of '49, who made the
mountains disgorge their treasure and the
valleys smile with grain field and orchard
by the travail of long years. They saw
that the land was a paradise and wel
comed others to a share of Its bounteous
rewards.
It has become proverbial that an Eng
lish tourist to San Francisco always car
ries a gun. Probably back in his club on
Piccadilly he has gravely discussed with
his companions the possibility of being
made to dance the high step on Market
street by some red-shlrted ruffian or hav
ing to flee for his life because he wears a
Bilk hat. This tourist, like so many of
his worthy fellow countrymen, has de
rived all of his knowledge of San Fran*
cifco from Bret Harte's books. He has a
vivid notion of San Francslco of forty
years ago.
But your typical Englishman Is ' too
shrewd to admit his surprise when he
comes here and meets gentlemen instead
of ruffiansâ when he discovers that others
wear silk hats and still walk the streets
unmolested. He finds, Instead of lynching
The secret of our San Francisco life Is

put his treasured gun awÂ»y and get out
his frock coat, for the woollness has

mantic distinction which may have been
ours in the old days of gold.
Thus the startling antitheses run on.
Contradictions, surprises, absolute anom
alies there are in our San Francisco and
Its life. But therein lies the joy of living.
A Parisian once committed suicide
through the absolute ennui which arose
from having to be always buttoning and
unbuttoning his clothes. He lived In a
city which was burned out, where there
Â¦was nothing new under the sun. He was
hedged about with the conventionalities
Â«n a r-rare Â«ociety.
He wculd eee a vast city spreading away
on its Jumbled hills from bay to ocean
beach. Interminable streets, thronged
with a people like unto the sands of
Arabia In number, would etretch away
on every elde In a tangled skein. On
â¢very hand lofty pile* of Â«tone would
mount high Into the air, their pinnacles
cft-timea veiled In clouds. A thousand
swiftly coving vehicles would ppeed be
fore his eyee to ascend some impossible
hill like a fiy on a window pane. A rear
lr.g a* of the voice of the DJln would fill
his ears.
Verily th# astounded Aladdin would say
Chat this was the Imperial Bagdad of his
Areazns, the wizard city of the Thousand
and On* Tales. He would bow his tur
ban to the street in obeisance to the city
of cities, tha handiwork of the Genii.
Nor would the adoration of our old-time
friend from the East be -wasted on* tittle.
He would bow to the unseen power which
had raised a metropolis upon barren card
hills within the brief life span of a man.
His adoration wouh' be for this city,
arisen in a night, to be the stepping stone

Truly San Francisco is the Bagdad of
America, It Is the city of wonders, the
place of surprises, the Mecca of true liv

snow. We have balmy winds when others
are broiled by a raping sun. Our city
roars with the trade of a continent and an
ocean, yet we have grass growing In some
of our principal highways. Our laws are
made by Americans for Americans, yet a
more varied people are subject to them

21count of the development of what inay bÂ«
fairly styled the industrial period of Cali
fornia. That could not be understood ad
equately without some knowledge of the
first "days of gold." Over those days the
glamour of the past Is thrown and mem
ory fondly reverts to life at high tide,
but the fact is that the present of this
State ia more uniformly prosperous than
at any past time, and during the Inter
vening years the foundations for a cer
tain and wonderful advance have been
surely laid.
A gold deposit, being a definite quantity
of precious mineral laid down by nature,
is to be exhausted and expended. When
the gold Is out the mine Is valueless.
State's Achievements

on the ledges and In fields where the
dredges have been worked advantageously

Miners' Association, who had access to
all reliable sources of Information and
statistical compilations referring to the
mineral production of this State.

science of agriculture and horticulture Is
steadily advancing, the new crop has a

predecessors.

/N a Â«ense there can never truthfully
be said that In California any one
period has ever ended. The produc
tion of gold Is still very large, and will be
larger In' all probability. In the opinion
of miners of Intelligence the exploitation
of the quartz ledges - : of Califor
nia is not anywhere near Its most
productive period. To the front has
come copper, and probably petroleum,
the annual California output of each of
these mineral deposits being estimated In
the millions of dollars. The placers are
not completely exhausted. Auriferous
sands are worked profitably and on a
very large scale by the process of dredg
ing, which was unknown to the world
when the "Forty-niners" entered this fa
vored land.
As illustrative of the genius of the early
California miners and as indicative of the
mental characteristics of the Callfornlans,
an essential factor In considering the ad
vance of the State, some allusion to the

Fevered Haste of Early
Miners Finds Only
Surface Gold.
/r is of common knowledge that Cali
fornia pioneers did not for a period
pay any systematic attention to the
developing of any Interest except that of
mining. Some enterprising men who saw
that there would be a demand for fruit
got possession of existing orchards. There
were few who Intended to permanently
remain in the country, the future of which
appeared to be largely dependent upon
the duration of the period of productive
gold placers.
The first gold period stands apart. It
was an episode In the march forward,
tilled with incident and adventure, with
the fever of riches suddenly gained, with
the tragedies which naturally resulted
from a hardly organized community - to
which bold and lawless spirits were at
tracted by riches that seemed to be easily
in reach of all: by unrest, enterprise, ro
mance; with life lived at high tension,
with disappointments bitterer than death.

In this State, where modern mining meth
ods had their origin and development.
Charles a. Yale, In a book published by
E. T. Benjamin, "California Mines and
Minerals," tells how gold mining ad
vanced from the start.
% In th* earlier history of sold mining la
California the main portion of the precious
metal was produced from the placers or sur
face washings, in the gulches, canyons and
river bara and beds. Oradually, however, as
was to be expected, the area for this kind
of mining was narrowed as the ground was
worked out and then attention was turned to
other sources of told supply.
Finding, as the miners of those days did.
these auriferous deposits at only certain points.
they very naturally looked for the- source of
the free placer gold. This led to tho (search
for quartz veins and also for the large beds
of auriferous gravel which were contained In
the hills of the mining counties of the State.
In time tho deep gravel deposits were found
and located and the quartz ledges were opened
and developed. Then the character ot the min
ing population changed.
In this connection it Is Interesting to
note that experience had to be relied upon
for advancement In all branches of indus
try In California. This has led to tho
sure and safe grounding of these enter
prises, errors being the best pilots after
all by showing clearly what Is to L*
avioded. There were mistakes in mining
methods, and there have been mistakes
In horticulture and agriculture, while
areas of land, In agriculture, have been
devoted to one special crop, which meant
that elth-.r there would be a large loss
or creat gain, so that the element of gam
bling entered very largely Into the prop
osition. But mining and horticulture
have advanced In this State far beyond
other parts of the world In many Import
ant particulars.
Concerning the errors In old mining
Charles Yale wrote In the volume before
mentioned:
In the earlier days of gold mining In this
State some very foolish and extravagant idea*
prevailed and many mistakes were made. As
a result many mines had to be abandoned after
more or less loss and people came to look
upon gold quartz mining as risky business. It
was found ultimately that the fault Uy more
with the men than with the mines. Basing
the entire yield of a lode on a few rich epecl
mens of ore from a chimney was found to be
fallacious; and . experience taught the lesson
that a good solid ledge of average ore was
far more valuable than a mere pocket mine
rich with specimens.

Stored Wealth.
,â^"URINQ the first period of the de
g J velopment of California may be ln-
U eluded the beginnings of horticul
ture. The growth of all branches of
activity In California has been at
tended with stages of development.
It is Impossible to show with great
accuracy the progress of the march
of the Industries resting upon the culti
vation of the soil. There have been retro
grade movements. The phylloxera has
caused the rooting up of many vineyards,
but the discovery of resistant vines fol
lowed and the cultivation of the vine was
resumed on a great scale. Various crops
have been discontinued In different sea
sons for some reason, but, as stated some
distance back in the foregoing, no Indus
try and no branch of any Industry In this
State that has been planned In advance
Â¦with intelligence has been permanently
discontinued. All enterprises survive from
the beginning, If once interrupted to be
afterward resumed.
The gradual evolution of the fruit and
'agricultural Interests has made It profit
less to attempt a detailed review from
year to year, or from period to period In
this connection, at this immediate time. In
all directions agricultural and horticultu
ral areas have been extended. Not less
true Is It that the manufacturing and
shipping Industries and commerce of Cal
ifornia have also been attended with
stages of gradual development. On tho
succeeding page the present aspect of va
rious branches of Industrial endeavor Is
outlined In striking statistics that are de
rived from unquestionably authentic
sources. It remains here to give some
sort of a summary of the mining period,
which may be made to include the re
turns up to a comparatively recent date;
but no reader should Imagine that the
mining Industry Is anywhere near Its end.
The official returns of the California
State Mineralogist for the year 1902 aro
not yet at .hand. Consequently the data
of 1301 must here stand for Illustration of
the present condition of mining in this
State. It is of common knowledge that
the production of mineral oil. petroleum,
has not increased according to possibili
ties for growth. This Is not due to lacJc
of facilities. Producing California oil la
comparatively a new Industry and Is etll!
in a primary period of evolution, it has
reached a business basis to some extent
In that the speculative pertcd of gambling
CALIFORNIA was originally
thought to be valuable principally
for its gold. Its glittering first
American decades, when the aur-
iferous sands of the placers daily
yielded treasures worth the ransom of
a king were, however, only an augury of
a greater future than was revealed then
tc the ken of men. In the winter, green
with verdure and gorgeous from smiling
valleys to frowning mountain peaks with
the gay garniture of wiid flowers, Cali
fornia hinted dimly to Its new citizens of
the vast sources of wealth other than
gold that lay hidden in its soil and that
needed only the Midas touch of industry
to reveal them. In summer the great
land was tawny, like a lion, sunburned
fcr.d gold colored and the vegetation of
winter was absent. It looked dead.
As the sleeping beauty of the fairy tales
needed only the right prince and the right
hour to awake. 60 It was with California.
The original pioneers who dared the per
ils of the "great American desert" to
reach the Eastern slopes of the sky-kiss
ing Sierra or who sailed around the
stormy cape or '"crossed the Isthmus"
were pioneers In a much wider regard
than they have been commonly esteemed.
They found a new land and wrested Its
gold from It. They discovered a new and
enchanted realm, lying under the skies,
walled In on the east by a boundary of
lordly skyward limits and on the west
by the greatest of oceans, that reached
out to the Orient and chafed impatiently
the shores of two hemispheres. The pio
neer spirit persisted. The discovery of
gold alor.g the mountain streams or in
the quartz ledges or In the channels of
ancient rivers of a forgotten era of world
hlbiory was succeeded by manifold other
revelations, each equally as Important and
each the fruit of industry.
The surviving pioneers of California
and their sons and daughters and their
grasdchlldren and civilized man in all
portions of the world have learned that
the Golden Gate has become the exit and
entrance for the vast volume of com
merce that moves between the cities of
the United States and the farthermost
ler.ds; that no product of the soil of any
clime under the sun transplanted In Cal
ifornia has failed to thrive even more
luxuriantly than its original habitat; that
California has furnished a large part of
the food supply of the world; that Its
wheat, barley, fruits, vegetables and
vines are required dally on the tables
of millions of men and women in the
Eastern and Western hemispheres.
Over the high Sierra are constantly
passing long trains of cars carrying Cal
ifornia's vaxled\ output and bringing sup
plies needed for a large and rapidly In
creasing population. Here the fruits of
a semi-tropic and of the temperate zone
thrive with equal and surpassing perfec
tion. 'While science had demonstrated
that gold mining will be carried on for
centuries in California with profit and
that the survival of its original industry
Is assured as a great factor in the prog
ress of the world for ages to come, no
less has scientific research Indubitably
pointed -out the equally significant fact
that every pioneer effort in a new in
dustry for California is a success.
More Fruitful Than Old
Nile Is Alluvium
of California.
THE high Sierras furnishes water
power easily convertible Into elec
tric energy sufficient to run looms,
spindles, mines and manufacturing plants
of all kinds for the world. The desert
places that were supposed originally to
have been starved by nature and to be
unfruitful for man have become the
sources of supply of cheap fuel that is
practically inexhaustible and have solved
all questions that have arisen in this
State of manufacturing operations on a
gigantic scale.
It is a true Etory and eternally im
pressive that there are hundreds of mil
lions of the inhabitants cf Asia whom
California can confidently expect to
Â»upply more and more abundantly with
various necesfclties. Millions of acres of
fertile lands lying in California valleys
are yet virgin soil, capable of giving the
world an output In cc-reals and in fruit3
vastly surpassing In value the wildest
dreams cf tbe argonauts when they saw
the millions of gold that were secured
with the pan and rccker and the prim
itive appliances of mining that were in
vogue In the romantic days of "49"
The valky of the Nile is not more fruit
ful than these untouched realms of agri
culture and horticulture in certainties of
opulence. Withal the inventiveness of Cal
llortiia has never flagged. From rude be
ginnings California brought the science
of mining to its present proud eminence.
The cultivated flowers of the gardens of
the world had to be brought here. All
fruits that are now known in the United
States uud the more common varieties
were unknown in this land of California
until man ronveyed them thither.
Science has In California differentiated
and improved many fruits. The Burbank
potato lias now world wid^.vogue. "The
Riverside Navel" pioneered the way to a
large market for California's citrus fruits.
Xlcstlccs ingenuity has found out the way
to make the Smyrna fig thrive in the val
leys of this State by the simple device of,
transplanting the blastophaga or fig wasp
from the lands of the Mediterranean.
Confronted with insect pests that threat
ened the integrity of grÂ«Â»at hoVtlcultural
Interests, the facile minded Californian
has searched the world over and discov
ered the hostile organism that, preying
upon the pests, has destroyed them.
It may be profitable to turn a glance
backward and briefly review material con
ditions as they were known to the Ameri
can when they first visited California.
As the virgin lands were then so
they are now. The presage of the future
was before the eyes of the early settlers.
At first they were unable to divine the
greatness that was in store for their
adopted home. Experience and accumu
lated wisdom and manifold successes of
those who came after the pioneers, and
who are now leading this State to still
greater achievements, have opened the
book of the' future so that all may read.
What has been done in countless In
stances to make the land blossom- as the
rose can be repeated Infinitely.
The kiss of the ardent sun Is always
here during the long summer months, the
season of fruitage. Water alone is needed
to convert seeming waste areas Into vine
yards and orchards. From the desert that
encompassed him the energetic dweller
of Southern California has wrested its
domain and countless orange orchards
scent the air witti spicy odor and grow
heavy with golden fruit. Hardly any sec
tion of California in ,the valleys or in the
foothills but is stored with Incompre
hensible possibilities of horticultural
wealth. Water in many sections is not
lndespensable. Huge crops are produced
annually In orchards and fields where Ir
rigation is not practiced.
The Intelligent observer, passing
through the cultivated portions of Cali
fornia, may see as clearly as can those
who are of this State the future from
the light of the present. All that is neces
sary Is to have the attention of the world
intelligently attracted. The result is as
sure in its bearing upon the growth of
the population of California as Is the
diurnal succession of light after darkness.
Mission Fathers Plant
Seeds of Country's
Future Power.
/T Is due to those who have carried
California along on the highway to
ward her ultimate proud destiny to
paint occasional pictures of the realities
of the past, that their deeds may be ap
preciated, that the future may be dimly
foreshadowed. The realization of fifty
years more beside this western sea will
Infinitely exceed the highest expectations
of the present.
So then let us look back to the time
when the planting of California with its
present characteristic products began.
That was in the days of the historic old
padres. They brought the orange, the
vine, the olive, vegetable children of the
clime where sunshine is always opulent
and where man has bounties offered to
him, en every hand, by ever generous
nature. ,
Historic records tell us that the olive
tree was introduced into California In
17C9, from San Bias, Mexico, by an expe
dition of Franciscans sent to take charge
of the Jesuit missions in California.
The Russians obtained a foothold here
early in the nineteenth centurv, planted
an orchard of mixed deciduous fruits at
Fort Ross as early as 1812. The Russian
orchards, like those of the Mission
Fathers, were not planted from a com
mercial consideration, but to supply their
respective owners with fruit for home
consumption. However, like the corre
sponding industry In the south, Jt served
to prove that fruit would grow in Cali
fornia, and thus became the pioneer of
the present great wealth producing indus
try of the State.
The fruits introduced into the two sec
tions of the State were characteristic of
the countries from which thev were
brought. The chief fruits brought by the
Fathers were oranges, figs, grapes and
olivesâ all fruits of genial southern clime.
They met on common ground in Califor
nia with those of the more rugged climate
of the northâ apples, pears and cherries,
âintroduced by the Russian pioneers.
The varieties of fruits grown in the
missions of Lower California, whence the
Franciscans derived their stock, were few
In number and consisted of figs, citrons,
oranges, pomegranates, plantains, olives
and dates. There were no fruits of the
north temperate zone, unless it were a
few peaches of very indifferent quality,
â¢which did not thrive well and were not
regarded as worth much consideration.
The Franciscans made their first Btop at
San Diego in 17G9 and proceeded from
that point northward, establishing alto
gether twenty-one missions, the last one
being at Sonoma in 1S23. At each of their
missions the fathers planted orchards.
The missions were a very small part of
California, but they thoroughly taught
the lesson of horticultural possibilities, In
primitive aspect, to the Americans when
they came to dwell In their land. Hor
ticultural areas were extended Irrespect
ive of the latitude until now the orange
Is cultivated successfully hundreds of
In oil rhares In newly hatched eoxnpanfw
of questionable value has p&jsed vary
largely.
But the oil producing industry had dif
ferent conditions to meet at the start
than had gold. There could never havt
been enough gold taken from the Â«oU of
California to destroy Its market value at
any time, the fact being that the precious
metal U Itself generally accepted as the
basis of value and as containing real
value. On the other hand, mineral oil
that was sought with hardly less eager
ness than was gold a few years ago Is
subject to the fluctuations of th* market
and has had to contend with peculiar
conditions at the outset.
Acres stored with millions of barrels of
oil that could be brought readily to the
surface and made ready for transporta
tion to points of consumption at a cost
of a few cents per barrel have remained
untouched in myriads of Instances where
experimental - wells have demonstrated
conclusively Its existence. The evolution
of a market has been a part of the de
velopment of petroleum mining as an In
dustry. Bearing these conditions In mind
It will appear too evident that the oil
industry Is but In Its lncipiency, although
already of vast proportions.
The discovery of petroleum In practlo
ally Inexhaustible quantities In California
Is asserted by Intelligent observers to be
equal In its Importance, In the further
advancement of this State, with the find
ing of gold.
Statistics' Show Midas
Treasure Torn From
Granite Hills.
rHE gold output of California, In
cluding the year 1901, has been esti
mated by Charles Yale to amount
to $l,362,365,0SS. ' The greatest produc
tion recorded was In the year lSi3,
when the total was $31,291,700. The
gold output for the year 1S43 was
estimated with very different results, the
figures going from $243,301 to $10,000,000.
The conservative view la taken by Yale,
who la the statistician of both the United
States Mint In this city and of the State
Mining Bureau, and he places the total at
J2*3,30L
The next year the total rose to $10,151.
3C0. In 1SG0 the output In sold was $41.
273406; In 1S51 it was $75,303,232; la 1S52 the
total was $81,234,700; In 1854 It was J63.433,
931; In 1S55 the amount was *S5,4S3,335; the
year 1S56 made a record of production oÂ£
$57,500,411. Then the product ran between
$40,000,000 and $45,000,000 per annum for a
series of years extending from 1S57 to 1S61.
Inclusive of both years mentioned. Then
came records In successive yeari of $33,
854.668. $23,501,736. $24,071,423 and Â¦d'on. The
surface placers had been largely ex
hausted. The quartz, drift, hydraulic and
other mining eras, the latest being the
gold dredging period, were ushered In as
the gold Industry evolved.
Minerals other than gold har* been
found Incidental to the mining of gold.
Greater economies have revived old gold
mines that once were discarded because
the former owners did not know how to
make them profitable or because the im
mediate returns did not fulfill the glit
tering dreams that were entertained when
the deposits were unscientifically opened
for production. Great mineral Industries
apart from gold have come Into existence,
not sprung suddenly Into the light, but
produced by careful and systematic ef
forts following discoveries.
In the year 1901 the gold output of Cal
ifornia was J16.0S3.044. The total mineral
output of the State for the year 1901 was
$34,355,981. From this It will be seen that
gold In 1901 was less than half of the
value of the minerals of California pro
duced that year.
A discovery that may be of vast Im
portance to California and to the world
has been made in Death Valley. It Is now
supposed that there is a sufficient quan
tity of niter in that desert and forbidding
section to supply the entire world. For
many years Chile has had the monopoly
of the production of niter for the man
ufacture of powder for military and for
mining use. Two large concerns are now
exploiting Death Valley for niter. The

green and cured, raisins and canned fruit,
wines and brandy, that are shipped out
of California go from great orchards in
the north. Nearly all the citrus fruits
that are shipped grow in the southern
portion of California, but about 2000 car
loads were shipped last year from the
northern and central part of the State:
The shipments of vegetables are about
equally divided between the northern and

The farm value to the grower of these prod

Is exclusive of the income from local consump

jjiOURTEEN districts in California
fi are now producing the crude petro
* leum upon which largely rests the
hope of California to greatly extend
Its field of manufacturing. Three
thousand wells are yielding oil
freely. The principal producing dis
tricts are the Kern River, Sunset, Mc-
Klttrlck and Midway districts In Kern
County, and the Coalinga district in Fres
no County; the Fullerton district in Or
ange County and the Santa Maria or Car
reaga district in Santa Barbara County.
The smaller, producing districts are Los
Angeles. Puente, Whittler, Ventura, Sum
merland, Bread Canyon and San Mateo.
These points range geographically from
Southern California to a point only a few
miles from the city of San Francisco. The
southern districts have been producers
for a long term of years. The promise
is that several districts will produce for
many years to come.
Dr. C. T. Deane, secretary of the Cali
fornia Petroleum Miners* Association,
makes the following estimate of the pro
ductive capacity of the oil fields that
have been discovered in Kern County
alone;
Tho life of an oil district depends upon the
number of proven acres and depth of the oil
sand. Experts . contend that about 20 per
cent of the sand is oil. and that about 80 per
cent of the oil contained in the sand can be
rtcovered; consequently, in a district where

It Is Impossible to give the exact acreago of
the lands located for niter, but tho following
will give some idea of the extent of the beds:
The number of acres located in the Owl dis
trict is more than 6000. Saratoga district more
than 8000.' Upper Canyon about 40OO, Lower
Canyon about 3000. Round Mountain and Val
lf" more than 3000, Confidence 2500, Salt
Springs about 800. Tecopah 2300, Pilot, Danby,
Needles and Volcano 8000^-a grand total of
about 85,000 acres. The minimum thickness
of the surface niter is Hir inches. One acre
of ground contains 43,560 square feet. This,
at six Inches depth, is equal to 21,780 cubic
feet. This at seventy pounds per cubic foot
amounts to '1,624,600 pounds, or 760 tons per
acre, say 750 tons, 30,000 acres, allowing S00O
acres to bo rejected, amounts to 22.000.000
tons. . Tho analyi.es show that niter exists on
some of the claims rich enough to rival the
beds of Chile.
The growth of manufacturing in this
Btate gives promise of the future. The
figures of production are evidence of the
present magnitude of manufacturing ope
rations. It is not feasible,* with the space
at command, to review the advance of
any "particular industry or - to supply a
table showing the relative importance of
the various lines of creative effort. The
beet ; sugar industry has expanded from
an output of 1902 short tons in 1888 to 75,
090 tons In 1902. The oil-producing indus
try maybe traced approximately. From
the annual reports of a series of years
the fact is developed that, going back to
1887, the total output of California petro
leum .was of the value of only $1,357,144
In total, while the product in 1901, the last
date of complete and official statistics,
the total was $2,961,102. The price per
barrel fell off, owing to the great discov
eries In Kern County, and manufacturing
was greatly stimulated by haying such
cheap fuel; but, the quantity produced
was vastly greater in 1902 than in 1SS7,
the comparative figures being: Output in
the. year 1887, 678.572 barrels; output for
1901, total of 2,961,102. Since 1901 the total
production Is more or less of a matter of
surmise, but the figures will show a great
advance when they are prepared from all
available returns. Approximately, It 13
known that California last year produced
from 15,000,000 to 16,000.000 barrels. The
present year will largely beat the record
for 1902.
The oil Industry will be one of the
The saline deposits of California have
assumed great importance as sources of
wealth. The value of borax produced In
California in a period of fifteen years. In
cluding 1901, amounted to $10,458,643;
soda, to $1,096,500; salt, to $2,225,576. The
niter deposits are still to demonstrate
their value, so far as official returns are
concerned. In a special bulletin Issued by
the State Mining Bureau the veil of pos
sibilities in that direction is raised, and,
while the industrial advance of Calfor
nla Is considered, the statements made
omcally by the State Mineralogist are of
interest:
California's copper deposits have a remark
ably wide distribution, being scattered over
the length and breadth of the State and oc
curring In nearly every one of thÂ» fifty-seven
counties. Thousands of dei/oslU have been
subjects of mining locations at different
times and hundreds have yielded at least a
few tons of merchantable ore aa a result of
superficial prospecting. There la hardly a
county in thÂ« State that has not, at iomÂ«
time, made at leaat such small contributions
to the copper supply. Such deposits, usually
small as far as revealed by slight development,
are scattered at varying 1 intervals along tha
borders of tha Btate and throughout â¢very
section of it except the detrltal deposits of the
valleys.
In 1901 the copper output of this State
was 34.931.SS5 pounds, valued at $5,501,782.
This gave this State the fourth place in
the United States as a copper producer.

densed to permit other material Interests
to be considered fairly, enough to Indi
cate that the foundation has been strong

greatness of California as a manufactur
ing State. Many refining plants have
been established to convert the crude pe

are thirty-three such concerns and they

and coke. Last year California produced

/V on the wide distribution of the
* â¢ olive orchards i of California as
showing climate and eoll adapted to
the production of fruit. In twenty
counties, from Shasta County on the
north to Kern County, which is next
north of the Tehachapi range of moun
tains, the generally accepted boundary
between Northern California and South
ern California, there are growing (300,000
olive trees.
In 1S87 California cut little figure in the
fruit market outside of its own limits. In
1890 the shipments had reached 16.000 car
loads of ten tons each. In 1901 they
amounted to ai little more than 65,000 car
loads of ten tons each. The shipments of
vegetables have grown from a trifling
amount to more than 9000 carloads. The
beet sugar industry has expanded. The
output in 1902 was 75,030 tons, as against
2000 tons in 1888 and there remain thou
sands of acres of sugar beet lands await
ing cultivation. General Chlpman says:
The table of comparative rains and losses
of 1902 over the output of 1801 shows a rain
In green deciduous and cured fruits, raisins,
cuts, wines and grape brandy and a loss in
citrus and canned fruits and vegetables. The
lots in citrus fruits was 9820 carloads of ten

carloads of vegetables. The rains were: 671.7

Along the chores of the bay of
Ban Francisco the smoke of scores
of new manufacturing enten>riEes dally
arises, showing the increasing commer
cial Importance of the entire State. Los
Angeles, the great city of the southland,
has had a large growth. Its building
operations have been extensive; its de
velopment solid and satisfactory. All
parts of California have steadily Im
proved In a material way: accumulating
wealth; giving rise to new enterprises;
strengthening old lines of endeavor; jus
tifying the hopes of the well wishers
of the entire vast commonwealth that
extends alone a coast line of Â£00 miles
south from the forty-second parallel of
latitude.
While tracing the forward march of
this Statti, It may be well to grasp one
significant fact as a key to all develop
ment. The stability of any industry that
Is once established In California is illus
trated by the fact that the gold output
of the State runs $16,000,000 per annum on
the average and often It surpasses that
figure. The gold mining industry has
been alluded to at some length on the
preceding page. It is more than half a
century old. The newer principal indus
tries now come In for extended mention.
Any Californlan being asked what home
industry, apart from manufacturing, con
tains the greatest promise for the future
of California would undoubtedly indicate
fruit culture. Areas devoted to grain are
very large. In many places thi great
ranches that were once exclusively de
voted to trowing wheat have been sub
divided and the policy <-f having
40,000 acres In one wheat ranch, which
was among the phenomena of the earlier
days, coupled with an ambition to raise
1,000,000 bushels of wheat per annum on
one farm, has been discarded.
Many wheat ranches have been turned
partly into fruit orchards or vineyards
for either table or wine grapes. So in
certain sections wheat growing has di
minished its area, but other virgin lands
have been brought under cultivation In
wheat and barley. For a century at least
and perhaps forever California will be a
strong claimant to the credit of supply
ing a large amount of daily bread to the
citizens of Europe, of the United States,
of the Islands of the Pacific Ocean and
of the countries of the Orient.
Fruit gTowlng in California is one strik
ing indication of the extent to which this
State has digressed In one direction from
its oil position as almost exclusively a
go!d yielding State. Figures and con
current facts In this regard are striking
and furnish a rarely interesting theme
for the contemplative observer of Califor
nia's Industrial advancement.
The foremost authority In California on
statistics-relative to the fruit industry In
this State is probably General X. P. Chip
man, who has annually, for a period of
years, compiled a comprehensive review
of material conditions for the California
State Board of Trade. There are 40,000,
000 fruit trees In bearing In California, as
shown by the returns of County Asses
sors. Undoubtedly many trees escape the
attention of the Assessors and the full
showing, if it could be made, would be
even more imposing. Oranges are grown
on 5,000.000 trees; lemons on 1,500,000 trees.
Other fruits are represented in round fig
ures by the following approximate show
ing: Apples, 1.3S6.200 trees; almonds,
1.161,000 trees; apricot, 2,305.200 trees;
cherry, .VW.000 trees; figs. 200.000 trees;
olives, 1,000.000 trees; peaches, approxi
mately, 6,000,000 trees. The remainder of
the 40,000,000 trees before mentioned Is
subdivided between the pear, plum, nec
tarine, prune, quince, walnut, pomelo and
lesser reoresented varieties.

tinctive aims and perform separate
functions in behalf of the business inter
ests of San Francisco.

largely. It has reached a period
wherein bo much that has been
desired has come to fruition, and
ca a larger scale than could have been
fceped for a few years ago. as to afford a
Â¦tanfiard by which to consider the future.
In the past five years the fuel problem
cf the Btate has been completely solved
by thÂ« dlacovery of almost Incalculable
CuaatlU*a of mineral oil In Kern and oth
er counties. Supplementary to these the
Cevelope*nt of electrical power has been
accomplished oa a very extensive scale,
Â¦o that dries at long distances from the
Blerra am lijrhted and supplied with me
chanical energy at a minimum of cost.
In the eane period San Francisco, the
principal part for the passage of com
merce by eea, has outgrown its old ac
commodations for shipping and haa been
compelled to Â«jnlargÂ» its wharves; has at
tracted the attention of the National Gov
ernment, by which the establishment of a
rreat coaling station near to the city Is
planned; has been connected with the
Orient and Islands of the Pacific Ocean
by a direct cable; has demonstrated- the
feasibility of the use of Its new fuel and
electrical power, which stand In lieu of

rlr.e array and has largely Increased the
facilities of the old lines.
It stands with two transcontinental
roads within Its gates, and ready to wel
come others eoon to come. It has enlarged
its manufacturing and trade area vastly.
It haÂ« taken i:*> new methods and has

rotlces with Interest the expendi
tures that the transcontinental rail

prove their lines and to lessen grades
that they may be successful competitors
with all transportation schemes by land

short. Ban Francisco, as the outpost for
California, contemplates a dazzling out
look and an extent of actual accomplish
ments that embody so general a revolu
tion of old-time conditions that they are
sufficient to make of this State, Indus
trially and In all material ways, a new
California.
Commercial Bodies Have
California supplies itself very largely
-with food, wines, etc Its foreign markets
and American markets are steadily ex
panding. In 1901-02 San Francisco exported
9,671,107 centals of wheat, 1,173,215 barrels
of flour, 4.2S1.1S2 centals of barley. . The
value of the wheat and flour that was
shipped last year was $14,433,321. The 'pack
of canned goods last year amounted to
2,141,650 cases, each containing twenty-four
tins of ZVi pounds each. Growth of thla
port was also manifested by the increase
in the customs receipts, which reached
the large total for the year 1902 of $7",64S,
433 83. Seven years earlier, namely, In 1893,
the total annual customs recefpts wera
but $5,4SS,S97 12. The internal rever.ua col.
lections for the last full calendar year
were $2,892,760 33. Of this total the sum
of $1,040,861 36 was paid on spirits.
The latest authoritative figures .con
cerning the extent of the manufacturing
Industries of California are found In the
census reports of 1900. According to that
authority, the total value of all manufac
tured Califorlna products in the year
named was $302,874,761, which was an in
crease of $S9,470,763 over 1SW1 The value
of live stock in California on January 1,
1903, is estimated by the United States
Bureau of Agriculture at $79,067,976. Many
new industries have been started each
year since 1900, and the output of manu
factures during the year 1D03 will greatly
exceed those of any preceding twelve
months In the history of California. In
the five years from 1S97 to the close of
1902, the bank clearances of San Francisco
rose from $750,789,143 91 to $1,373,362,025 31.
Last year wine and brandy were shipped
out of the State by sea and rail to the
amount of 8S63 carloads of ten tons each.
The lumber production of the State in
1902 reached the total of 663.179,680 feet.
The reader will probably be filled with
amazement that in one State should ex
ist such great diversity and magnitude
of products. The facts must remain
sadly Incomplete without, at least, a cur
sory glance at the great ship building In
dustry that centers at the port of San
Francisco.
The naval construction at this port by
the Union Iron Works, in a period of
fourteen years, for the United States, has
included the battleships Oregon and Wis
consin, the cruisers Charleston, * San
Francisco, Olympia, Tacoma, California,
South Dakota and Milwaukee; the gun
boats Marietta and Wheeling; the moni
tors Monterey and Wyoming; the tor
pedo boat Farragut, the torpedo boat "de
stroyers Perry, Preble and Paul Jones;
the submarine boats Grampus and Pike.
The values represented by this fleet of
twenty vessels is $27.16o,000 for construc
tion only. Some of these ships have world
wide reputations, especially the Oregon
and the Olympia. The Japanese cruiser
Chitose, that cost $1,500,000, was built at
the Union Iron Works. So were - the
steamships Alaskan, Arizonan and Cali
fornlan, the Peru, St. Paul, Senator, Po
mona, Spokane, Helene, Maul, Llki-likl
and other steam vessels.
Since 1837 there have been constructed
on the Pacific Coast and documented at
San Francisco more than 600 steam and
sail vessels, the collective values of which
run high into the millions of dollars.
At the date of the last completed fig- ,
urea for the whole State, the value of
the property of California for assessment
purposes was $1,230,730,465, the returns be
ing for the year 1902. The total value "of

was at flood tide in this State, was $64,

â¢with In any one year Is $31,234,700, this be
