Â¦.Â¦'Â¦' "Hardly less, numerous but infinitely,
more artistic are some "of the new draped Â¦
pictures, Â¦-, in â¢ which ;*. all. the 'old-tlmp
.classic and many .new and 'novel poses .

the ultimate, will .be I doubt if. even the
wild fancy of the summer - girl; herself
can picture. It is. sure to be something
extraordinary." . . .
"However, action of this. sort is only- a
minor part of the new fad for strenuous
ness' in photography. -What the pretty
girl really desires most nowadays -in com
bination with alertness in' picture are
moods. Where she m!ght : secure a mere

â¢ "X'dd to this that tber* never was such
finery of all eortsâ such 'extravagance in
Hosiery and shoesâ and it .Is not difficult
-to -understand why the women with' pretty
ankles and feet are so-eager, to have them
conspicuous â modestly, conspicuous,- . or.
courseâ Iff their own faybrite . pictures.
Vanity, you say? Well â maybe.- But vani
ty that is well nigh universal, to, say .the
least. ' â¢ . . Â¦â¢Â¦...
"But certainly from "the .standpoint of
art' It li not vanity .at all, but a .quality
that must be reckoned with in 'any effort at
pleasing results. Just' observe a .woman
standing in repose, and take note how the
skirt-^eve'n the Best fitting skirt-imagi
nableâwill . often â¢ bang : in straight .ugly
lines. Such "a \ pose is fatal to artistic
.photography. Take a picture of her thus
and no matter how handsome of 'face- or
figure she may be, she will look as' If she
.had been chopped from a block- of wood.
There is no life,' no animation, no ac
tion. In such a picture, and as I said-be
fore, lifeâ animated, pulsating lifeâ la the
only thing that counts nowadays.
"Perhaps it Is out of all these elements
therefore that the summer girl's fancy for
having herself photographed in â¢ all so: tÂ»
of outing costumes has^ grown. . But no
matter what the causes, it is astonishing
to what . lengths, the 'demand, has .been
carried. And now Is the season when the
bathing girl ls;in her glory. With the
daintiest or the most- dashing costumes
that were ever created for ordinary ev
eryday wear to choose from la It surpris
ing- that the taste for these pictures is
rampant./ We have had the fencing girl
and the golf girl and the tennis girl in. be*
wUderlng variety, but the summer bath
ing - girl never before ) attained the . popu
larity that she has this year. ' o : Â¦ .
"And hef fancy in pictures goes far be
yond mere .portraitsâ the common ordi
nary poses, which always looked as If the
suit itself were the first and only consid
eration. Now everything, must be a-flut
ter just as It would be If she were stand
ing, walking, or posing In any of the in
numerable wiles or grace's so dear' to the
girlish heart, along a wind-swept stretch
of. glistening sand..' Skirts, .hair ribbons
and accessories of alt kinds must take on
the action of the Wind.. Thus a stunning
girl can' enhance her charms by borrow
ing something of the ocean's Impressive
grandeur by .hiving herself photographed

"Likewise/ the modest little beauty 'can
take on an added degree -of helplessness
and absolute dependence by having her
self- photographed- under the same condi

coldest masculine nature - in - the World

It. is not Just the sort of thing she would
do -before any. but- her very .closest and
most confidential- friends. . â¢ ' -i^. 'â¢' : ;
"And just here let me say that that ia
one of the most remarkable. things about
the new fad for 'strenuous' pictures;
women Insist upon having their feet ap
pear under any and air conditions wher
â¢ ver possible, with, good reason, no doubt,
from the feminine point of view.
"First it must j be remembered that the
standard of physical perfection in Cali
fornia Is, without doubt, the highest In
"If she Is in street dress she 'wants this
picture taken with her* skirts daintily
gathered In her hand, head carried su
perbly poised, the" whole figure Inclined
forward in correct attitude., arid with, a
goodly display of shapely ankles quite as
If she were just photographed unawares
while out for an afternoon stroll.
"If It is a dream of a tea gown all the
accessories ' ' of 'a. fashionable function
must be provided or the pretty glri will
have none of It Â¦ She must be shown
graciously 'receiving* or languidly dis
pensing hospitality to .her guests, even
though they be only Imaginary, quite like
the 'real thing.' And again must the slip
pered foot be in artistic evidence.
"People will not have pictures' that ara
not full of action,' Nowadays," he-, says.
"Women particularly 'are coastantly de
manding the : unusiiaiâ something striking
and critlr.el. Their gowns are the first
and most important '.consideration, but

Back pf this. Percy Imagined for a time.
that he had discovered Uncle Peter's true
reason for descending upon them. Hlg
bee would tiave regaled him with, wild
tales of the New York dissipations, and
Uncle Peter had come promptly on to pull
him up. Perclval could near the story as
Higbe'e would word It; with .the improv
ing moral incident 0/ his own son snatched
as a brand from the "Tenderloin",
to' live .a life of -impecunious. Use
fulness ln far Chfcago. But when
he tiled to hold this titlief, and
to prove it from bis observations/ he was
bound to admit Its falsity. For Uncle
Peter had shown no inclination to.act the
part of an evangel from the virtuous
West. He had. delivered no homilies, no
warnings aa" to the fate of people who in
continently "cut loose." He had evinced
not the least sign of any disposition even
to criticise.
On the contrary. Indeed, he appeared to
Joy immensely in Percival's way of life.
He manifested a willingness and â¢ a ca
pacity tor unbending ln boon companion
ship that were, both of them, quite amaz
ing to his accomplished grandson.' By de
grees, and by virtue of being never at a!l
censorious, . he familiarized himself with
the young man's habits and diversion's.
He listened delightedly to the tales of
his large gambling losses, of the bouts at
poker, the ' fruitless venture in Texas oil
land, the disastrous corner in wheat, en

SoUncle I*eter-and his charge, had es

of the" squares, a dingy .monument . to. the
tlihe when life had been less' hurried.; Un*
cle Peter had stayed ; there thirty years
before, and he found .the place unchanged.
The carpets -and. hangings -were .a .bit
faded, but the. rooms" were generously
broad; the chairs, as -the", old zna.n re-.
marked, were "made: , to sit In." and. the
cuisine, was held, by a few knowing old
epicures who still Xrequented the /place,
to-be superior even ; to that of the ,mori>
pretentious Hlghtower..: The service- It Is
true, was apt to be slow,. Strangers
who chanced in- to order' a. meal .not in

before -their â¢ food "-â¢â¢. came. .. .trailing
plain- short., words.; . of. . :. erxtreme. dis
satisfaction- behind them as they' went.
But the elect knew that these delays; be
tokened, the presence, of' an. artistic, con

was worth. texryUig.-. for...: "They ..know 1 :

From. :thlÂ» '.headquarters ' the .old -man
went forth to Join in- the diversions* of h^s"

old man. - "J Jest" can't keep hlmioft'the
street's hlghtii" was* bis- chief complaint.'
By day Billy Btue- walked the-. streets in
a decent.. orderly, trance -of Â¦bewilderment.
He was -properly puzzled and .amazed- By"
many strange matters. He _ never/ could â¢
find out .Vhaf w,as *Â»going on" to" bring,
so many folks .into to,wn.-.- They/all hur
ried somewhere. -constantly, but he- was
never able "to" reach the- ceftter Â«of ex-'
citemehu-'-'Nor did he ever learn how
any one -could reach -those high 'clothes-
Hues, strung forty feet .above ground be
tweeri'the.backs of houses: nor now therÂ»e
could be- "so many shows fh town." all
oii" one night": nor why you should get
so many pood things, to eat by "merely
buying a' "slug of whisky"; nor why. a
thousand people weren't-, run. over : in
Broadway tach twenty-four hou*rs.
At. night, -Billy Brue ceased to' be the
astounded a'.ien, and. as Perdyal said
Dr. Von Herzllch would say, "began to
mingle and co-operate with his environ
ment." In the course of this process he
fell Into adventures, some of them, per
haps, unedlfying. But It may be toU
that his diver watch with the br^iUl'd
leather fobr was stolen from h!m the
second night out: also that thÂ« followl"?
week. In a Twenty-ninth street bsIooii.
he accepted the hospitality of an affable
stranger, who had often been in- Mon
tana City. His explanation of subsequent
events was entirely satisfactory, at least,
from the time thAt be returned to corf
sclousness of them.

Do not. put. this aside as being too melor
dramatic for our prosaic twentieth cen
turjr..- : The -"whole of. this so-r
clety, lasting now for one. century, is so
fraught .with : picturesque tragedy- that,
compared/ with it* annals, .the most ex
travagant fiction items dull. Every en
terprise, undertaken by the Mafia is out
of the ordinary, whether kidnaping, mur
der, blackmail or counterfeiting. Every
man la the ord/- is prepared, to fulfill
bis oath, too, but he demands an\ even
chance.
From a confession alleged to have been
made last year by a Mafia- prisoner,
charged with the killing of Catania in
Brooklyn, these murderers are described
as deciding who shall put a man to death
by th*. tossing of cards. The elect sit
about a table, the cards are shuttled and
one starts, to deal. Ace of. diamonds' is
the fatal card, and the man to whom it
is dealt is given a certain time within
which to accomplish his mission. ;'
By the account" of a secret service man
who stumbled Into a Mafl* crowd while
looking for anarchists, the favorite meth
od is what they call "thirty-thre*." In
this death count the candidates, six, a
dqren or twenty, put both hands on the
table, but withdraw whatever fingers they
choose. Each finger is counted, begin
ning from a certain point, and thÂ» owner
of finger No. 23 is elimlifated. He sits by
to see the test narrow down to- two per
sons, one of whom will be surely elected.
Equipped with ; citizen papers, these
' . This man was associated with a coun
terfeiting gang that has engaged the ef
forts of William G. Flynn. chief of the
New York division of the secret service,
for more than a year. Madonia's brother
in-law, De Prima, was also of the crowd,
but is now serving a four years' sentence
in Sing Sing. ; ; . 'Â¦
There Madonia visited him recently and
learned that the $1000 raised to help De
Prima- had been appropriated by the
"gang/' Enraged at this breach of hon
or in the Mafia,. Benedetto Madonia came
from his home In Buffalo to demand the
return of the fund. His wife implored
him not to visit New York. But Madonia
swore on the brass crucifix about his neck
that he would compel the Mafia to accede.
The threat he probably used was a prom
ise to betray the whole gang and take his
punishment with the rest So futile was
his errand that, but for the secret service
vigilance. It is extremely doubtful whether
Madonia's' body had ever been identified.
If the Mafia is mysterious to the point of
uncanniness in its operations, hardly 'less
so are those men employed by the 'Â¦ Gov
ernment to hound Ua members. ,' . . .
Italian outlaws scatter all through Amer
ica, Canada and Mexico. ; L.ast .year.-oh
nearly the same day,; their bands mur
dered 'a'.' merchant . m Brooklyn, burned
the house of a. fellow countryman in Ha
*letbh, : Pa., and .kidnaped a rich, citizen;
of the- City of Mexico, holding him for
550,000. ransom: Â¦'." :.Â¦Â¦â¢â¢>. . 'ir.'- â¢'"''â¢'â¢ M
For the most part their operations are
confined to .counterfeiting and 1 blackmail
ing their own countrymen, j In pursuancs
of these crimes, a murder is every now
and then' committed.' The' stabbing of
Benedetto Madonia Is a precise Illustra
tion. ' . .
"The eeaential idea is opposition to gov
ernmental authority*, a condition of the
epirlt. The Mafia .itself has.no recognixed
headâ no one to. give orders or pass Judg
ment. . The ecciety includes one or two
good men; .the great .majority are vile.
They' have an oath.- 1 believe, and certain
forms cf procedure, for instance. In the
chooeing of one who Is to commit a mur
der. But for .entire secrecy they rely
upon each man's hatred for established
law and th* fear of vengeance." V*..
In connection- with this, says Collier's,
it is interesting to know that there is no
such word aa Mafia in tne Italian or any
other language. From two or three
sources the writer learned that, accord
ing to the Sicilian legend. Mafia is really
a. cryptogram, each letter representing
one word of a five-word bath. * The first
Is mcrdo, meaning death, and the whol*

To remedy all this, let the man away
on vacation, or while on his little excur
sions to country, mountain resort or sea
ehore. take up a system of hot weather
physical culture. He will not be at it
long before he will find that it is far more
exhilxrating than working in a gymna
sium with dumbbells; that improvement
Is more speedily shown; that agility and
eelf-rcllance Is developed in abundance
and tkat be is being made over so rapidly
turo's best kind of gymnastic apparatus.
Hill Climbing.-To get the right kind of
exercise from hill climbing, select a hill
that is not too steep. Take as long a step
upward a* possible, at the same time sup
porting the body^on the, rear leg. every
bit that'you can. r Next plant" the cane or"
staff that you carry in one hand firmly in
the ground as far ahead as you can reach
and still keep erect. (Figure L) . Then
. The (balancing caused by this -exercise
brings into play the upper legs, ; the
thighs, the small of the back and the ab
domen while bending. The shoulders and
arms are also strengthened by ; pressing
hard on the cane, and if care Is taken to
hold' the cane alternately in each hand de
velopment will be even. ".
The exercise is fine for heart and lungs,
as it stimulates deep breathing without
abundance. So at the season when he
should be feeling his best, when every
thing that grows is in greatest . vigor,
xoan alone suffers from muscular and
dental depression.
that his friends are wondering how he
has managed it in such a brief time. Â¦
This is especially true of that system of
open-air physical culture that has . to do
with hill or log fence climbing, two of na-
slmultaneously, place the body's weight on
the forward leg and advance the rear leg
for a long step between the other leg and
the cane. Repeat the movement when go
ing down hill. Â¦ Â¦";'.â¢*-
; "When the muscles are accustomed to
this .unusual exercise, spring over/- the
fence by lightly touching the hands to
the: top rail, or go over It in > vaulting
style, 4 with the legs well drawn up to the
body v while going over the" top. Also run
and "Jump* overthe fence without touching
it,' and' later on walk up to and go over
it in* similar "manner. In a short time a

you V will ' have no ;'reason ' to dlst ract' your

inal region. . .
A final word. Of coiirse, In outdoor
physical culture the , same general rules
should be observed as. when Indoor work
Is carried on. Be careful . not to exercise
Just after meals. Dress properly, which.
In this case, means old and as little cloth.
Ing as conventionality allows. Exercise
until general "weariness sets in, and then.
If the sea, a stream or a lake is not con
venient," take a cold shower or a cold rub
down. Also, If \ou would Improve the

play. /
Matches might consist of. from twenty
to a hundred games, and were spread
over several days, beginning early In UÂ»*
morning and lasting far into the day. At
the. start the- ball was generally thrown
high up into the air. and then the wildest
scramble would ensue as tt fell, and a
score of players would leap up at It to
strike. Wherever the bail went, there the
field would follow with wUdV yells, and
one at last would pick up the ball In hla
stick, and make off like a deer, twisting,
ducking, leaping^ doubling, while forty or
fifty braves pursued at top speed, for
there were no restrictions In the way Â©t

III. Vaulting.â This is a very muscular
exercise and onÂ» of the hardest that can/
be done on log or fence.- For this reason
it would be well to start ' going over a
small object ! s

In a few words. Place the hands on the*^
top fence .rail, conveniently apart "and f
with the^firiger tips of -'each .hand turned-,
away . from each other. Then, while hold-','

II. Plunging and Natural Massage.â
Put the stomach: on the top rail. The
body being heavier 'than the legs, the
head and arras descend and the hands
are placed, palms downward, upon the
ground. (Figure 3.) After this position,
has' been secured, - throw Iho legs over
the fence to either side, and get up on
your feet. \ -. . .-,.Â¦â¢â¢
, I. The Vibratory Exercise.â After, self
assurance; arid suppleness- 1 have been en
couraged in. this' manner,; seek out a
strong and convenitsnt' fence of the rail
or rustic variety and praetlco . the efil
cacious vibratory exorcise on it.
This consists, simply- in walking up to.
and over t'he fenco without putting hands
to it, clearing it.' in twer more steps
according to" its height (Figure 2), aiid,
when the rear foot, is drawn to the top
rail, stepping to the ground with a clear
sw.eep with -the other. _ ~j'- r
As this exercise causes- the entire body
to vibrate in order to retain balance, an
exhilarating effect la produced on the
vital organs, and the tendency Is to > re

8no_textThe trouble with the making of any
Princesse gown Is not so much in the
There is another and a still nicer kind
of a. Princesse and one .which, will be
much worn this fall. It. Is the Princesse
which is made of cream-colored cloth and
which. is fitted to the figure as though the
wearer had grown into It. To make such
a gown requires an experienced hand, and
when once it Is made it must be worn
carefully, for a very little hard usage will

too tight, or if the bust is too snug, the
gown will draw and. there will be ugly

smoothness.
The; Princesse that fits as it should fit
is 'the one that has broad, well-molded
hips, .without a suggestion of a "draw,"
or a', wrinkle.- 'It should have a waist line
that is perfectly snug and that looks very

which one so often
sees in 'the street,
those. Prlncesse
dresses which "seem
to bring the waist
line ud under the
chin and which
swell the figure to
twice Its natural
proportion!..
* The necessity for
the straight front
Is emphasized by
the new style of
dress. The plainer

the flatness.
The new corsets
arÂ« 4Â«Mfhtfully planned In this respect
and it la a very neglectful woman 'who
cannot find one ; to fit her. Without
squeezing the figure they manage to
flatten* it out and the result is that lovely
long straight fronted line which is the
delight of the present day dress artists.
As fall draws nigh Interest gathers
around the new fall jacket, for It will
soon be time to put it on. There is some
thing about a fall. coat which possesses
a certain romance all Its own. .With the

Â¦ the making * of a
Princesse, for she
cannot realize ' the
Importance that at-
The newest and most popular style'of
Princesse for the street Is made of navy
blue face cloth, very light In weight. It. is
cut with a long skirt, made very plain,
but with a six-Inch band of trlmmiruj
around the foot. The trimming can be a
coarse black lace let into the goods, ur it
One of the arguments in its favor is its
neat appearance. There Is something in
describably trim about the Princesse, with
its smooth front and Its snug hips. .There
is something very neat also about its
waist line, or the line where the .waist
should be.- .
Instead of gaping at the back of the
belt, as so many gowns do. and instead of
disfiguring "the waist with bands and
buckles, the Princesse chows a long, -neat
curve and the gown really makes a wo
man look taller, slimmer and more grace
ful in any way. ' â¢ . â¢ Â¦
But the Princesse is by no means a
dress to bÂ« worn for common. .It is a
dress-up gown and must be kept as such.
Its- lines, being very close to the figure,
soon get out of shape, and unless careful
ly handled the front will wrinkle up over
the stomach .and the whole will have a
wrinkled, mussy look, instead of a trim
appearance. . . <

dot- s. not pretend to- be as popular 'or as
ustful u.Â« ihe shirt wV'st' suit, still it has
its owu points of superiority. '.. . .
can oe an. embroidery or a passementerlo,
or a band of. tucking.
The train of this navy blue cloth Prin
ceÂ£Â«e must be rather .long, for it is a.pfyte
of dress that demands a -sweep skirt. It
cannot be cut off at pedestrian length.
for it is not built to look well that way. Â¦
The upper part of the Princesse fits. the
hips as though It were molded to them.
It lies flat in the front, in the regulation
straight front manner, and It sets snugly
over the bust.
If you want to be very up to date with
your navy blue Princesse you can wear a
little Eton Jacket with it and you can
make it of black lace, of the heaviest
sort" of novelty lace. It is better still .to
cut a jacket out of coarse black lace In
sertion, choosing the heavy Italian sort,
or the imitation Russian laces. You can
use a little Armenian embroidery: around
the edge If you so desire.' ~
The advantages of the Princesse gown
over other dresses are many and decided.
"While it can never take the place* af the
Then there is another way of making
the Princeese. And this is the Etyle which
is chosen for a negligee. It can be cut fo
that there Is no break at Ihe waist iire.
It is not fitted to the figure In any way.
It does not set snugly over the hips nor
does it hug the back. Its main point is
that it is cut to fall from the back of the
neck and it sweeps in folds right down to
the floor and to the end of the skirt. The
front Is fitted, bat the back is loose. This
etyle is vtry becoming to certain very
short women or to very lean ones.
Or It can be made all Jn one Diece. to
that it will fall In an unbroken line right
from the back of the neck to the tip of
the train. .- '
But the improfeo* Prince? se- ; ifowfis ar<Â»
entirely different and there are many, fea -
tures sbont them which are- well wotUi

The Princesse can be made â¢with or
Â¦without a Jacket.
It ran be made up either as an X-ray
<Sr*es or of he?\-y material. /-^ :
; It can be piÂ«iin or completely covered
by embroideries and trimmings, r*. ;;
Its upper part can be made with a sep

THE SUNDAY CALL.
THE
PRINCESS
CHARMING
IS NOW THE
STYLEIn my early days with the camera I
used every possible means of becoming
proficient in . manipulating the Instru
ment, and read many voluminous writ
ings on the subject.' but found no infor
mation; which speedily brought' me face
to face with the causes of my most
glaring defects, and at the same , time
suggested methods by which they might
be prevented.
* In order to Increase my stock of knowl
edge by observation and association. with
others Interested In this line of art.
This will materially aid the 'â¢ye of the
operator In his work and secure abso
lutely correct lines In his results.
the camera was perfectly. level while fo
cusing. Many "operators use a small cam
era level .glass, wljlch can be- placed per
manently on the side of the Instrument;
but this is ndt necessary If proper care is
"given to the position of the camera. "
There are, on the other hand, beginners
who are so anxious to have,* "straight
picture" -that they lose, sight of the char
aster of their subject, and' in their per
sistent b*ut mistaken efforts to have
things level present many odd .and un-,
truthful effects, "such aa losing s^ght . of
the true horizon and making their hills
and ascending roads appear on the" level..
. I have in .mind an example of this kind
of r work. It Is a photograph of a man
standing upon a wharf, while -the water
in the background runs uphill, when Tin
truth it -should be perfectly- level. You
can imagine the ridiculous effect of such
a scene. I .would suggest an .easy and
; simple remedy." *Eake a lead pencil and
'.draw upon the ground glass of the cam
era a true horizontal and a true perpen
dicular line. . â¢
â¢ XI-TOO MUCH FOREGRO-UND.-Thls
cannot bo. called a very serious defect in
a picture, but tt .is inartistic and objec
tionable'.from -the fact that too. much
unattractive material la Included in the
prospect. â¢ It may.be said that the super
fluous foreground can be â¢ . cut offâ and
that Is trueâ but the picture would be
reduced 'and you -would thereby lose an
effect you -might otherwise attain. Many
things are to be considered in proportion
in g the foreground. Of course the hori
zon must not divide the picture into two
equal parts. It may appear either above
or below the middle of your subject But
the appearance ot too much foreground
It" is desirable, to have 'your subject well
lighted arid Well modeled in shade; 'this
gives character and . effect] to the 'picture..
It Is" very monotonous to the *oye to .vie.w
a landscape flat in colbr a.nd void of con
trast as regards effects in. light' and
shade. '. - '.vVv.- Â¦ ' Â¦
â¢ . ' . â¢ â¢ â¢
To prevent the presence of this ihtrpder
make your exposures about .the time of
the sun's, meridian, or .place yotir camera
at the side of tne subject, er'incroase^the
distance between the camera and the ob-
Jefct to be photographed. . Â¦' : .
It Is to- be remembered that siiould* you

Pictures! like that shown in illustration
No. 13 are quit'e common witrj the begin
ner; they are not the result of incor
rect focusing, but of sheer carelessness
In regard. to the' position 01 the camera. I
have , kiuttvn amateurs ..to overcome all
the early difficulties in photography 'and
yet to fail repeatedly in their pictures,
because they forgot to make sure that
In a'ny study, unless It be- tne ascent of

; XIFâ TOO MUCH SKY.â The* ; artist
Vould say of such a picture t>a appears
in illustration No. 12, "There is too much
canyas 'to'let' here." Thts" fault is Just
as. objectionable. as a disproportionate;
amount of foreground. There are. it Is;
'true, m.any -pictures in which exquisite
.clcfud effects charra thp beholder. * Tb,e
words "to'o -much" cannot" be apolled to
these -faithful portrayal.s by an apprecia
tive and gkillful photogrraDher. You will

proportions to be lncluded'.Jn'a landscape

.'.- In looklnc through the album of an
amateur a short time ago I "perceived
'that/ in the majority of the 'photographs,
.three-fourths ofc the picture* looked quite'
' insignificant in the remaining space. * .

as well as in her most ench.ant.lng appear

no undue proportions to enter your -pic-

Hence I strongly advise this latter

gained at the outset will save the ima ;
teur many trials and discouragements,

this ' accomplishment Is of such a -minor
importance, "compared with the One arts,
that it may .be used only as an amuse

I cannot refrain from protesting* against
the. aversion to the camera, frequently,
expressed by "artists "of note. This preju-,
dice, however, exists to a less extent than
heretofore, since 'many* painters of the'
present dayÂ£ either openly or in "secret,
make use of this once . despised Instru
ment as an auxiliary' to their work en
canvas. In making this statement I do
not wish to be misunderstood. The artist'
uses the -camera merely to register on
paper an impression, "hitherto the office
of the memory. " -. * ââ¢:-
An amusing Interview took place not
long, ago between a- prominent marine
artist and the author of this work, in
which, the camera was held as a cup of
poison in the " fingers of the painter. I
had suggested It to him as a" means of
preserving the appearance of ocean
waves. The proposition was received
with a scornful refusal, accompanied by
some harsh comments In reference to my
valued little friend,, the camera. Several

clubs; and societies; . but .my progress"
was still so slow and tedious that trfeaUy*
I determined to recelve'practfcal instruc

plly proved most successful; the "dan
ger line" was" at last passed. Disappoint
ment's over ruined plates* became of less
frequent occurrence, under and- over ex
posures ceased to be a perplexing prob

THE SAK FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. AUGUST 2, 1903.
TUCSON, Aria., Aug. 1.â "Andy" Grlffln,
a notorious "jun man" of the border, has
met the fate that comes to all of hla kind.
He was found yesterday by "William E."
Storrs, a freighter, lying by the roadside
near Bisbee in a pool of his own blood,
with his throat 'cut from ear to ear and
two bulletfioles in his head. AH Indica
tions point to the fact that he was mur
dered. Storrs" attention was attracted to
the lifeless form by the roadside by vul-.
tures, which flew away at his approach. â¢
Griffin was found on the ground beside
his wagon and harness, his horses having
been turned loose. Many tracks circling
about his body showed* that" he made a
terrific struggle against his murderers.
Hie remains bore the marks of having
been hacked and mutilated. Griffin's gun
was found by. his side wltb an empty
shell in the chamber.
Griffin â¢ tva.3 last seen alive Thursday
leaving his mining- camp In Â¦ Huachucas
bound for Bisbee. He had a Mexican In
his company, and this man is believed to
be the murderer, as a hat found near the
body has been Identified as belonging to
him. He has disappeared, and It Is
thought that he, fled. on one of Griffin's
horses/losing hb hat In his haste to get
away from the scene.
Griffin was CO years old, .an old soldier
and a noted gun fighter. He killed a man
named Powell .at his own camp two years
ago, and It was at first thought that
Powell's brother ha'd avenged the murder
by killing Griffin, but thla brother, who
lives in Bisbee, had no trouble In proving
an alibi. Tha.officers have _reaÂ»on. to be
lieve that the murderer was a hired as
sassin, that, his .'plans .were well laid and
that.. he. Is already- far. on his. .road into:
Mexico. * "':.'..

nighty the streets are thronged with
men, women* and children. Sheriff Bosqiilt
has sent word to all surrounding points,
and armed men will flock to the scene of
battle that will be fought out at daylight,
and the killing of Rutherford and Jones
by tho murderous convicts will . be
avenged. .* . . , .
The deepest regret Is felt here at the
Untimely. end of {he two brave men who
met death to-night on the mesquite-cov
ered hill near the Grand Victory mine at
the hands of the outlaws from Folsom
prison. The members of the militia com.
pany volunteered for duty, and the whole
State will deplore their death. But one
thought pulsates through the mind of
every resident in El Dorado County and
adjacent points to-nightâ the slaughter of
Rutherford and Jones must be avenged.
LACERVILLE, Aug. l.-No one in
Â§_ j Placerville or the adjacent towns
JÂ£^ will eo to -bed to-*iight. At mid-
Jones and Ruth

Avenged.
"Armed men are flocking to the vicinity
from all directions. There are. about 250
men around the hill where the battle took
place. Lieutenant Smith say 8 he. is con
fident that the convicts are in the brush
in ' ; the hill and that it : Is Impossible for
them to , get away. He says they will
never escape.""
The hill will be guarded to-night and
the plan is to send volleys, of bullets Into
the brush as soon as daybreak. It would
be very dnr.gerous to do this at night, as
some of the men hunters might be shot
by. their friends. ' -
PLACERV1LLE. Aug. l.-At 9:30 to
night Fred \ Vanderhayden. : who
drove a wagonload of soldiers from
Placcrvllle to the scene of battle,
has just returned here. He says:
"We arrived at the Grand .Victory mine
at' 8 o'clock. Lleutenant^Smlth, who is in
charge of. the militia and who went-out
from Placerville this afternoon to trail
the convicts, reported that two of his men
had been killed/Rutherford and Jones.
Jones Is a married man with three chil
dren and Rulherfordi3 a single man. Pri
vate Gill was shot 'through the shoulder.
Gill is at the house at the mine and Dr.
Mountain! has extracted the bullet. Lieu
tenant Smith says that it was impossible
to recover the- bodies of the men who
were shot, as they, were right, under the
guns of the convicts, .who were on thei top

NEW YORK. Aug. Lâ More than two
hundre.d miles of electric railway, worth
millions of 'dollars, extending throughout
Queens and Nassau counties,' Long Island,
has passed into the control of a trust
company In this city. This is probably
one of the largest street railroad .deals
ever made In Greater New York.
For some time the Pennsylvania Rall-
Toad' Company and the interests -repre
sented in the subway Rapid Transit are
'said to have" desired possession of these
railways. Eleven years ago the Steinway
interests, which then owned the horse car
system in .xwig Island- City, began to
build a tunnel under the' East River. The
work, came to a disastrous end when a
dynamite explosion killed several men and
did $500,000 damage. By means of this
tunnel the trolley system of Long Island
could be made a part of the subway sys
tem of Manhattan, and several times it
has been reported that the electric system
of Queens has passed .into the control of
the Belmont interests. . v
Whether the trust company represents
ttui Belmont or the Pennsylvania Railroad
Interests could not be learned.
Among the .roads said, to have passed
into the hands of the trust company is the
New York and Queens County Electric
Railway, which was owned by a Philadel
phia ' syndicate. This ' road operates
branches extending all through Athens,
to College Point. Flushing and Jamaica
and all through Long Island City. It also
controls tho New York and North Shore
Road, which extends through Jamaica and
Far Rockaway and. connects at Queens
with the Nassau County Electric Railway,
another branch- which; connects villages
in Nassau County, and expects to send
connecting llneti Into Suffolk County. .The
line also skirts, the new * $2,000,000 race
track now building on th* line between
Nassau and Queens counties, to be known
as Belmont Park.
In addition to lines already in operation
many unused franchises go with the roads
purchased, so the ct-npany acquiring the
property can- practically gridiron the bor
ough of Queens.- ' '

The greatest satisfaction is felt
that Seavis, the blood-thirsty ne

in the battle to-day.
The whole community is up in
arms. The men are furious with
rage and are burning to tear the
murderous outlaws to pieces.
There will be no prisoners taken
at all events. The plan of attack
as already formulated will prove
effectual. . The cordon will . ad
vance at daylight very cautiously

mish order will be maintained^
The summit and the three sides
of the hill are thick witn brush.
A man hidden in the under

away. Consequently the outlaws
are bound to get some one.

Is Scheduled

PLACERVILLE, Aug. 2.â
At 2 o'clock this morning it was
learned that a man named Will
Springer, who joined in the hunt
to-night for the convicts, was
accidentally killed by William
Blake, one of the posse. Blake
met Springer in the vicinity of
the Grand Victory mine, a short
distance from the scene of the
fight. Blake called upon Springer
to halt. Springer, it is learned,
was slightly deaf. He failed to
hear the order of Blake and Blake
fired, killing Springer.

member of the militia, has just
been brought in. He has been

nursing him. She belongs to Pla
cerville. The latest report from
the front is that the convicts are
surrounded on a hill and cannot
get away.

That the outlaws did not fly is

further. It is thought that the

last volley while they fled over

The country about Grand Vic

thinly populated. as that in the
Lotus and Webber Creek dis
trict, from . which the convicts
have recently come. They have
undoubtedly traveled many and
many a weary mile, for all reports
to-day indicated that they were

hill above the mine the convicts
have seen the militiamen a long
distance away.

DB. PIE3CE'S REMEDIES*
THE FIRST STEP
Of the child is an event in the mother's
life. How proud she feels when the
attempt to walk is begun so early as to
evidence childish courage and sturdy
strength. Such pride should be enjoyed
by every mother. But it often happens
that the child is timid,
weak * and deficient in /J*%A
vitality, and clings to the
mother's arms with no \sM%b
desire to walk or play. ft& Jif
Mothers should learn \ Â«p>Â§
that to have strong chil- V WM
dren they must them- awJHgf\
selves be strong, for the jr JSr

Prices of stocks have recovered some
what In this week's market, and senti
ment has improved on the whole. Tho
market was unsteady at times on the re
covery, and scattered liquidation was stl'.l
In evidence hare and there In the special
ties. There were sufficient doubts remain-
Ing also over the general situation and
outlook in the country to restrain the
buying of stocks on any considerable ad
vance. But the forced selling of stocks
hypothecated in loans has been much Jes3
in evidence, and this fact has allowed
prices* to riee somewhat on tho demand
from shorts to cover and on a moderate
Investment demand. There has been ap
prehension of the usual .consequence to
follow such a period of drastic liquidation
such as the renewed liquidation of any
advance of accounts allowed .-to carry
over the period of acute weakness In the
market in the hope of a more favorable
ppporiunlty to make the turn. There is
Korn<? <lread also of the possible reaction
ary effect of the long fall in securities
values on the general business and indus
trial situation. .The. fall in values has re
sulted in an enormous shrinkage in the
available basis for credits, and the possi
bility Is canvassed of a contraction of
credit in commercial lines as a later se
quence. â¢ Â¦ â¢ .- â¢Â¦- . â¢â¢ -
Vice President A. Barton Hepburn of
the Chase National Bank in an interview
which has commanded widespread atten
tion and comment in Wall street uttered
a distinct warning of the danger of over
expansion and credits at this time in com
mercial lines, as well as in promotion pro
jects. : The note of conservatism is still
dominant in the financial world, and the
uniformly unfavorable reports received of
general business conditions from all quar
ters havÂ« not been sufficient to change
this feeling. > Al . Â¦Â¦â¢ \
It is evident that the repayment of the
Pennsylvania notes, whlcn was expected
to reduce the loan account of the banks,
has been made in part to the trust com
panies. The call tor payment of $3,000,-

rina Underwriting and for $3,600,000 on the
l.onlsviille and Nashville bond underwrit
ing had to bo provided for. Bankers also
leport that there Is growing up a large
reasonable demand for mercantile credits.
It Is Intimated, furthermore, that there
has been a very large liquidation of loans'
to truat companies during the week. The
week's stock market liquidation has been
admittedly very heavy, and the above rea
sons are advanceu to explain why thu
liquidation is not reflected In the loan
Hem of the associated banks. It must be
remembered also that liquidation involves
buying as well as celling, and some of
the banks have been taking up stocks for
their customers at what th*y consider ad
vantageous prices. Thu yelling on the
bank statement was not pursued, and the
market steadied and closed lifeless. -
NÂ£?W YORK, Aug. l.âDealings in stocks
were so small and the tone of the trading
was so indifferent to-day that nttfe sig

stocks influenced by special causes. There
was selling of Rock Island induced by the
criticisms of tho proposed refunding bond
issue. People's Gas rose more than a

Company of the suit brought .against It
by the State of Minnesota caused- a four
points jump in that stock on' the curb,
but the response In the general market
was barely susceptible. The increase in

of more effect, as much had been made
by tho speculative dement of a supposed

Chlen was 30 years of age'and had many
friends' among the foreign residents of
fhe cltv, who described him as an edu
cated, high-minded gentleman. The af
fair has created intense feeling in the for
eign community and. a strong sentiment
against surrendering the Shanghai re
formers to Chinese jurisdiction.

PEKING, Aug. 1 A journalist of thlÂ«
city named Shen Chlen was executed
here yesterday.- According to the official
report of the execution Chien was be
headed, but it became known to-night
that this report was false and that the
condemned man was beaten to death in
accordance with special Instructions Is
sued by the Dowager Empress, who de
sired to, make an example of the jour
nalist with which to terrify â¢ other re
formers. .
The Incident is declared to be the most
horrible that has occurred in China since
the. massacre of 1900. The killing occurred
in the courtyard of the yainen of the
Board of Punishment. The victim was
beaten with bamboo rods for twoyhours,
the flesh on his back, arms and legs be
ing torn to ribbons. After life had ap
parently become extinct, the execution
ers, fearing that Chlen had merely fainted
and might revive, twisted a ropa tightly
around his. neck and left the body in this
condition until this morning.
No one exct-Dt officials was permitted
to see the prisoner after his arrest, his
friends being denied an interview with
him and all information regarding his
condition being withheld. The evidence at
the 'trial was so weak that Chlen would
probably .have been acquitted had he not
boldly proclaimed his principles through
out and his willingness to die for them.
He frankly admitted the charge that he
had attempted to organize a rebellion in
Hankow in 1900, and boasted that he had
always advocated the assassination of
the Manchus in order to rid the country
of the dynasty. ,
Despite the precautions taken by the of
ficlals, the prisoner smuggled from his
cell a farewell message in the form of a
poem, in which he glorified reform and
exhorted his colleagues to continue the
work.

Special Dltpatch to The Call .
REDWOOD CITY, Aug. L-Cbarges of
manslaughter have been made against
Gcor&e B. Mcl>ellan', Howard II. Mc-
Uc-llan and Brismo Martine for the kill
ing of younc George A. La Palme on
Tuesday last. Howard McLellan and Mar
tine have been in Jail since Tuesday af
ternoon, .when they surrendered them
selves ' to the officers, claiming at the
time that the shooting v.-as accidental and
that t"he.y were firinjj at a telephone pole.
which t was between them and the four
young boyswho were swimming in the
creek back of the' Mcl^ellan place near
Beresford.
. Tho officers made an Investigation upon
the following day "and ascertained that
the telephone pole . mentioned was
not in line with the swimming place
of the boys and -that the story told by
McLcllan and Martine was. false in this
respect. When confronted with this fact
It is said that* the young men admitted
they' were flrlnc in the direction of the
boys, but over their heads -in nrder to
frighten them off the premises. This .was
in direct contradiction to their first story
that they did not know of the presenc.e
of the boys. Upon further investigation
the officers learned that George B. Mc-
Lollan was present at the' time of the
shooting and that he had shouted to 'the
bathers to get off the'place. It is'doubt
ful, though, whether he was heard, as
the distance between him and them was

through the fall in prices of stocks and
bonds generally. . Â¦â¢-:Â¦:â¢
Consolidated Lake Superior alone has
caused a loss of more than $40,090,000, cal
culating on the high prices which the
stocks commanded about a year ago and
the figures at which they now sell. The
loss through the collapse of this corpora
tion*3 stocks has been even more severa
than that occasioned by the failure of the
Asphalt Trust. The stocks of Consolida
ted Lake Superior found wide distribution
among all kinds of investors as well as
speculators. Philadelphia manufacturers
put large amounts into the enterprise, re
lying on the directors' judgment and
business sagacity.
Besides the manufacturers in the board
cf Consolidated Lake Superior there were
S. M. Prevost and Samuel RÂ«>a, vice presi
dent!? of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and
E. J. Berwind. men of approved practical
knowledge. Whatever the errors and mis
tukc-s In Consolidated Lake Superior,
startling and cosily though they were,
it must PC-em that these managing com
panies were . sincerely enthusiastic over
Us future. The officers and directors were
Jieavy holders of stocks, both common and
preferred. Inside selling: was not detailed
in- advance of the collapse.
It is a well-known fact that the labor
question is one of tho gravest problems of
the Rand. The British Government has al

QUEENSTOWN, Aug. 1.â Their Majes
ties subsequently returned to Queenstown,
where they received further addresses.
The King then made his farewell reply,
saying the people could rest- assured that
be had the interest of Ireland at heart,
which remark elicited vociferous cheering
and much waving of flags and hats. The
royal visit to Ireland was thus brought to
a successful close. The King and Queen
are both enchanted with the tour, which
is admitted on ail sides has achieved
more toward the settlement of the exist
ing Irish grievances than legislation could
hope to achieve. When their Majesties
re-cmbarked on the royal yacht for Cowes
the strains of "Come Back to Erin" min
gled with the salute of guns.
CORK, Aug. 1.â The firing of royal sa
lutes and enthusiastic cheering welcomed
I King Edward, Queen Alexandra. >and tho
I royal party on their arrival at Cork this
i morning on board the royal yacht Victo
ria and Albert. The port was bright with
bunting, the whole town was well deco
i rated and tho streets were filled with
â¢jubilant sightseers.. The Lord Mayor and
Corporation of Cork welcomed the visitors
when they landed. Their Majesties drove
through the decorated streets, which were
lined with troops and bluejackets, to the
racecourse, where the King presented
colors to the two Irish regiments.
The Catholic Bishop of Cork was invited
to assist at the ceremony of blessing the
colors, moat of the men being Catholics,
but he refused to be associated with the
Protestant chaplain.
During the afternoon their Majesties
visited the exhibition. The royal proces
sion to the grounds was greeted every
where with the same warmth which
marked the previous functions during the
King's tour. To the addresses presented
by local bodies the King replied, saying
that his previous great interest in the
welfare of Ireland had been further deep
ened by his present visit. He had gained
a clearer insight into the conditions of
Irish life, and hoped the legislation on
which Parliament was ergaged would con.
tribute to the prosperity and contentment
of the Irish people. But 'good laws alone
would not secure that end. There was
need of better industrial training for the
young, a keener spirit of co-operation
among all classes and the creation of new
and varied sources of employment for the
people.

TEXTS OF SERMONS AT
THE DIFFERENT CHURCHES
ness, delicacy, tenderness, the scnsltlve
ncss'of light and shade necessary and pe
culiarly demanded by the conditions of
an open air performance. But she has
the "swashing of " the martial outside"
and always the grateful suggestion of
vitality, and though Jt bo not her most
notable effort, yet Miss O'Nell's Rosalind
la well worth i^eing.
Fi. J.' Ratcliffe is the Orlando and does
fairly well in spite of his most modern
accent. He looks not Orlando by much
and gets out of It little of the poetry of
the part. But he is virile and most grate
fully audible
L. R. Stockwell'8 Touchstone is better
in key than any other of the roles, though
Miss Stoddard comes near with a very
happy Celia. Mr. Stockwcll's Jesjjtr is
delightfully human and humorous and
wholly free, from the stagincss that
marks most of the other work, and Miss
Stoddard's Celia Is charming. It is gay,
arch, winsome and most prettily pictur
esque.
Of "the rest Mr. Millward's 'Jacques
comes nearest to tho mark, Mr. Carr's
Duke being as bad as his George Tesman
is goodâ which is saying muchâ and the
Audrey of Miss -Ricca Allen a flaming gro-.
tcsque. The smaller parts are well filled
in. There Is some good choral singing
and a solo or two by Mr. Wilkle, who was
tripped up badly In, his first song by the
aforementioned orchestra, but' gavo p'eas
ure by his rendering of "Blow, ThouiWtn
ter Wind." Some of the costumes are a
delight in themselves; othersâcombina
tions of acid greens, shrill pinks and
screaming yellows-rshould be suppressed.
But. air In all, the O"Neil "As .You Like
It", is a production that any one interested
In the drama cannot afford to miss, and
that will doubtless be five times as well
worth .seeing to-day as it was x yesterday.
There are: performances both this after
noon and evening. . .
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
As Rosalind and Celia Miss O'Neil and
Miss Blanche Stoddard made their grace
ful way through the trees, ' Rosalind in
gay blue, Celia in tender white and yel
low, the "atmosphere" began to take on
the Shakespearean color. The glorious
camp of Arden hove In sight and the
clock of the years went swiftly backward.
But not for long, alas! With Corbett's
advent as Charles the Wrestler one was
brutally hustled back into to-day, and the
deadly anachronism rioted from then on.
It was not.JMr. Corbett's fault. Corbett
wrestling with Shakespeare was of the
chief novelties of the performance, and it
must be owned that he let the bard off
lightly. In fact, Mr. Corbett did nobly.
With E. J. Ratcliffe he "put up" a pic
turesque fight, allowing the cast's Or
lando to win after an apparently "tough
tussle" and being carried off the flald in
a cleverly dead condition. There was a
little enjoyable doubt in the audience's
mind as to whether the lust of battle
would permit the pugilipt to lose, and
possibly a little disappointment when It
did.
No. it was not Mr. Corbett's fault when
the atmosphere got lost. Jrhe fault was
with the stage manager. That Corbctfs
"rubber"â or whatever ho Isâ with a
Turkish bathrobe, watched the ex-cham
pion at his work in full view of the au
dience: that the "stage" was dotted
throughout the whole performance with
the peripatetic photographer, policeman,
"cullud gemmen," McKee Rankin in a
top hat and a carnation, the twentieth
century damsel, and various and sundry
adherents of Mr. Corbett, was not that
gentleman's fault. But the atmosphere,
only by snatches, was gone, and a pro
duction that might at least have borna
the stamp of conviction, sincerity, be
came, not seldom, farcical. However,
there was enough left to--gU4npse a de
lightful possibility, â¢ to show a kind of
entertainment destined in time to become
a favorite form here, and to exhibit Miss
O'Neil in a new and attractive light.
As Rosalind tho gifted California ac
tress does not make the hit of her
career. "More than common tall," beau
tiful and graceful, she. however, .realises
very handsomely the physical demands of
the character. /
In doublet and hope of brown, with her
own gold hair, she rriake3 an Imposing
picture. There is a marked development,
too. on the comedy side in her work, a
distinct improvement in her use of her
voice. But the part is not one to com
pel Miss O'Neil's best effort. Her com
edy is yet forced, theatrical, a Httlo
heavy, and her touch lacking the quick-
waving trees, upon green, lush grass.^with
the scent of warm earth about, and to the
music of birds that might have sung in
Arden Forest, Shakespeare's creatures
walked and talked again their little hour
upon the stage. The day happened to be
decent, pray and still, with a slant of
milky sunlight now and then that fell
very kindly upon the gay garb of the
players. The "stage" was arranged just
below the Sutro house, its gentle lawns
and tall trees making an Ideal setting for
the comedy. . As in Shakespeare's day,
the orchestra was. placed . behind the
players â one wished It even farther at
some stages of the performanceâ and the
audience was comfortably seated on a
grand stand built to hold some 3000 peo
ple. Some of the seats were empty, but
the "house" was good and excessively In
terested in the- performance.
Miss Nance O'Nell and her com
pany of players In their open-air perform
ance at Sutro Heights. Throughout, how
ever, the affair was interesting. Under
JL'ST a glimpse of the delightful
possibilltes of that most charming
pastoral, "As You Liko It," was
afforded yesterday afternoon by
Rosalind and Orlanda

HELENA. Mont., Aug. 1.â According to
W. J. McHaffle, who is printing the jour
nals of the recent Legislative Assembly,
House bill 55, under the provisions of
which the eight-hour law was to be sub
mitted to the electors of the State as a
constitutional amendment, was omitted
from the Journal of the House. Authori
ties hold that such an omission is fatal
to the act and the people of the State will
not be given an opportunity to vote upon
the proposed constitutional amendment.
McHaffle made his discovery while read
ing the proofs of the journal. The bill
in question passed both houses with prac
tically no opposition and was approved by
the Governor March 3.

A. J. Rich anticipates a very great ad
vance in San Francisco in the next two
years. Air. Rich has just returned from
a tour of Europe, and has also studied
business conditions In the Eastern cities
of the United States. "There is the cus
tomary dullness of the season here, but
the outlook for business is unquestionably
fine," said Mr. Rich yesterday. "When -I
was in New York I heard a great deal
about transactions in Wall street. Such
transactions affect realty on the Pacific
Coast very little. This coast has its own
individuality. San Franeisco and other
Pacific Coast cities are growing steadily.
They will continue to grow, for all the
conditions are favorable. Great attention
ts directed to San Francisco upon the
pure merits of the prospects that it has.
I saw no place abroad that. suits me so
well as San Francisco as a business prop
osition." : â¢?-Â¦:Â¦

A fish porter, fixed one day's expendi
ture upon beer at 5s 'Id. He had earned
5s M. of which 6d was spent on his bed
and Id on food. He said he passed in his
work a particular public house sixty
times in going and coming on thirty sepÂ»
arate journeys. Each time he passed he
"looked in" and had a final half pint at
the .end of the day's work.
In the increase in the consumption of
aerated waters. Dr. Hamer sees a .good
omen for general health, provided sani
tary conditions are observed.â Ntw York
Commercial. Â¦ hW'^^r:
Of thirty persons questioned one day
only three did not take beer. Fifteen took
from three to four olnts a day. and the
rest varied from ona to over ten pints
daily. One remarkable Instance is quoted.
It is given on the authority of Mr. Jury,
the council's chief inspector: Â¦
Such a list places all on an equal foot
ing. To arrive at a fairer computation
Dr. Hamer further classos the people of
London into three divisions, men. women
and youths under 17. Then he assigns the
quantities as follows:
Youths. Women. M*n.
Beer , 3-5 pint 1 3-6 pint
\V1ne. spirits 1-3 oz. 1 2-3 oÂ».
Aerated wuters ... 'i jMnt J /i pint pint
Mi'.k Vj Pint V4 pint 1-10 pint
Hot drinks 1 pint Ity pint 1 pint
Cold water ... v .. 1 pint % pint - !4 plnl
Beer, it will be noticed, heads the list
in quantity. Dr. Hamer quotes the opin
ion of Mr. Shapley. a "C. C. C." inspec
tor, to the effect that inmates of common
lodging-houses drink on an average four
pints of beer each day. besides spirits, and
a considerable quantity of tea. The lodg
ers appear, he states, to eat comparative
ly little solid food, but many <Jf them
spend all that is left, after paying for this
and for their bed, upon beer.
Wine, spirit*, etc., 2-3 cz.
Milk. ."Â» l-.'l ozs. Oust over Â«i pint).
Hot drinks (tea, etc.), 23 ozÂ». (almost Hi
pints'*.
Cold water, % pint.
Hot weather tends to a general interest
ha all things drinkable. The report Just
issued by Dr. Hamer. assistant medical
oflicer of the London County Council,
deals with the whole of this interesting
subject. On the general question of the
amount of liquid required for the average
human being. Dr. Hamer says the gen
eral expert estimate is three pints a day,
but he himself raises this quantity by a
quarter of a pint. This is exclusive of
the amount of liquid conveyed into the
body through bread, meat and other kinds
of food.
Away from this general average women
require less than men. and children less
than either, although they drink far more
in proportion to their bulk. Taking all
Londoners, in one general group. Dr.
Hamor fixes the following average quan
tities of liquids consumed by each indi
vidual every day;
iiÂ«er, 10 ozi. (i-5 of a pint).
A* rated watpr, 5 cm. (Vi pint).

Standard goods that we have been able

packers will be obliged to find some way
out of the difficulty or they will havo. to

Baldness Due to a Living Minute
Germ.
Many people, even unto the present day
of grace, consider baldness due to heredi-
tary influence. - !
Nothing is further from thÂ« truth. Bald-
ness is caused by the onslaught of a
minute organism which secretes itself be-
neath tho scalp and .attacks the roots of
the hair, causing it to lose its life and fall
out. *
This onranism cannot b* got ' rid of except
by the free and persevering u*e of Newbro's <
Herplclde.
No matter how badly the scalp ts affected,
the dandruff surely disappears and hair health
I* restored when Herplclde la applied. "De-
stroy the cause, you remove the effect;"

There are two explanations offered for the announced intention of Acldicks to retire from
Delaware politics; one is that the leaders of the party arc weary of fighting his battle and intend to
eliminate his fortunes from future campaigns ; the other is that Addicks is weary of paying the ex
penses of a lot of politicians who get office while he gets nothing, and intends to eliminate them from
his payroll. Either explanation is sufficient and perhaps both are true. -. - ] ; V;"
A gentleman of leisure in the East, being skcpticalof the common saying that the average man
uses only 2OOO words, while Shakespeare's vocabulary included 15,000, set to work to make a calcula
tion of his own on the subject and after what appeared to have been fair, tests, reached the conclusion
that the average well educated American knows the meaning of at least 50,000 words and uses about
20.000. It will be seen then that Shakespeare is not in it with us in the matter of vocabulary, but
the fact remains indisputable that he could swing his words in a way that makes the talk of an ordi
nary man look mighty small. - \ p -;

GENERAL BOBRIKOFF, who in the name of the Czar exercises dominion and authority
in Finland, has found to his surprise that while the ancient liberties of the people have
been suppressed so far as customs and forms of government are concerned, they still linger
and live in the hearts of the people. Finland indeed is crushed, but the Finns remain, and
while they are not strong enough to grapple in fight with the power of the Czar, they are yet capable
of speaking boldly against the oppressor. For the purpose of suppressing speech and stifling cries
that disturb his peace the general lias issued a decree condemning to exile any one whom he finds
guilty of such offenses. The sternness and severity with which those decrees are being carried out
have roused a new clamor, and it is probable we are now hearing the last cry for constitutional liberty
that will ever come from Finland or her people while the Russian empire lasts.
In a circular letter addressed by representative Finlanders as an appeal to mankind against
the wrongs inflicted there is given an elaborate review of the situation as it exists and of the tyran
lvf.s ccmmitted under the forms of law. The letter closes by saying: "Some of the most prominent
citizens of Finland have in these days been deprived of a right particularly sacred to the inhabitants
of every civilized country, and, according to Finnish law, not forfeitable under any circumstances â
the right of living in their native land. None of them were informed of the offense laid to their
charge. It seems that the selection of victims has been determined chiefly by personal rancor on the
part of the Russian officials, or based upon unconfirmed accusations made by irresponsible spies. It
has even occurred that the space reserved for the name of the exiled in the order of expulsion had
not been filled up when the document was presented to him. The receivers of these orders have,
moreover, been subject to domiciliary visits, connected witji brutal violence and destruction of prop
erty, the police, in the absence of the owner, forcing their way into offices, warehouses and indus
trial establishments. We are no such optimists as to believe that this tide of evil deeds from which
Finland is suffering at present could be stemmed by any expression of opinion in the press. But we feel
a des"ire to lay our case before all those who have hitherto taken a sympathetic interest in our coun
try and to acquaint them with the latest and most glaring display of a regime which aims- at the
complete destruction of our existence as a nation. In the name of civilization we protest against this
barbarous attempt to devastate a field of western culture and to demolish a structure of law and jus
tice built up by the exertions, of centuries."
The demand of Finland for the continuance .of her liberties, solemnly guaranteed by the oath
of the Czar himself, has been denied. Her appeal for protection against a lawless despotism has been
treated as a crime, and her last cry for justice is to be stifled in her throat. The inevitable result will
follow. Russia will make a desert and call it peace, and for a time silence will prevail; but in the
end there will come the cry of the savage beasts that dwell in deserts and Russia will hear out of the
dark places of that once welt ordered land the hoarse voices of men. degraded and maddened by her
tyranny, growling with similar voices throughout the empire, of insurrection and assassination, of
re vole and anarchy. '

â¢In <lrcat Britain the apparatus with
which experiments were made consisted
of a cableway fitted on the Muriel collier.
It has had several sea tests and the re
sults -were considered' highly successful.
The collier delivered thirty-flve to forty
iojis. of :coal per hour in a moderate sea

These-, experiments, according to H. C.
Fife In tlie Scientific American, have
xeached *a practical conclusion so far as
.'the United States navy is concerned and
the United States battleship Illinois is
T.o-w completely fitted with an apparatus
for .taking coal at sea. She is the first
warship to b.e completely equipped with
â¢the marine cabfeway. and. her equipment
. will, permit her to take coal at sea from
any masted 'vessel. The Imperial Russian
battleship." Retvitan is also equipped with
a similar Installation, which is giving sat
isfactory service".
HE matter of coaling our warships
# " I .^r sea' cut no small figure in the
â¢ I \ operations of the American fleet
I eft* the southern coast of Cuba
The success so far attained in the prac
tical operation of the apparatus, to say
nothing of the improvements that are
sure. to follow from some inventive brain,
will increase the "radius of action" of
our war vessels by a very large percent
age â In fact, more than double It. For
Instance, -they .could stay off a blockaded
port for an indefinite time provided the
colliers had free access to them. .
Loads can be hoisted from the port
deck and then the starboard deck, al
ternately, to the two men at the mast
head. One of these takes in his hand the
loose ring which is attached to the. ele
vating hook. When the load carriage
reaches the collier's masthead the ring
is p'.aeed by hand over the hook of the
carriage, a lever is pulled on the elevating
truck and the load is dropped and thiiB
transferred to the load carriage. This
operation can be accomplished in two sec
onds. The other man takes off the empty
bags on their return from the warship and
sends them down to the deck for refilling.
In the original experiments on the U. S.
S. Massachusetts a pair of shears was
erected and guyed for the support of a
large canvas chute, through which the
bags of coal were dropped. All of this
has since been dispensed with, the ropes
of the cableway being all pulled down by
a niggcrhead on the quarterdeck winches
when it is desired to dump the load.
The improved method of delivering the
coal is as follows: The load starts out
from the. collier on a downhill route, con
tinuing so for more than half tho dis
tance. When the load is just clear of the
center of the *pan and is in its lowest
position the man on the quarterdeck of
the warship commences to pull down the
hauldown block. By the time the bags
reach the block they will be training on
the deck. Ths operation now stops for
an Instant, the lowering continues for a
foot or more, the load is unhooked from
the carriage, *>mpty bags arc put on and
the whole apparatus is then raised to its
normal position. At the *ame time the
operator on the after bridge sends the
empty carriage back to the collier for
another load.
The load carriage works very simply. It
contains three wheels and a "grip" ar
ranged in a vertical line. The elevating
devices can be stowed away on the war
ship and set up on board a collier at s*?a
in a very short time. A sheave block is
lashed to the foremast and mainmast, and
these support the sea anchor line and al
low it to play freely through them.. Just
below is the tail bJock, about which the
conveying line bÂ«Â»nds. At a point above
the sea anchor line another lashing Is
made, and two three-fourths-inch wire
guy ropes arc there attached and led for
ward to the starboard and port sidÂ«Â»s of
the ship, where they may be attached to
the deck at almost any place found con
venient.
OPERATION IS SIMPLE.
lines (weight each 508 pounds) and two sea
anchors. Th*Â»n there are the hauldown
block carriage, loading blocks, etc.. all of
which occupy a space just below the deck
16 feet long_ 7 feet wide and 4Vi feet deep.
Several improvements have been made
In the marine cableway since the early
experiments between the United States
battleship Massachusetts' and the collier
Marccllqs. The sea anchor lino is now
seven-elghths-Ineh diameter in place of
three-fourths-inch, as formerly, and it
will easily sustain the tension duo to con
veying one ton of coal. The sea anchor.-,
have not been altered in any way. The
coil spring, weighing 1203 pounds, attached
to the mainmast would be completely
compressed under a load of 20.000 pounds,
but a 12.000- pound strain is all that is re
quired to carry a load of one ton. As
the warship dips and rises in the waves
the spring will compress and elongate in
uniformity with the ship's motion, and
this serves to equalize the somewhat
varying strain on the sea anchor. This
spring as used on the Illinois is eight feet
long and is heavier than that used on the
Massachusetts.

Bierce. It smacks of Ambrose Bierce
from cover to cover, save where Edgar
Allen Poe is given hi3 hallowed niche.
It is Bierce plus something else; that
something is Herman Scheffaur. Bierce
it is which dictates the pessimism which
too often clouds the beauty of the
thought. When Herman Scheffaur speaks
per se he says, some good things.
The poet prefaces his volume by the
broad assertion that he writes for nature
and for art. This gives him a broad field.
It frees him from the limits bounding a
poet with a purpose. He can sing of any
thing from unrequited love to a dead dog
on the City Hall steps and feel that he
is paying nature and art their dues.
Sometimes he sings; again he sighs; oc
casionally he vituperates with a whole
some vigor.
To those who have kept a close eye on
the verse columns of our contemporane
ous Western periodicals, the name of the
newly heralded poet his no strange sound.
But those of us who can only snatch a
morsel of our Shakespeare between work
ing hours deem this collection of the writ
ings of ten years something: new.
It is difficult to take the gauge of the
bard whose first book still smells of the
presses. The reader balks at the first In
troduction through the very nature of
things. He is unwilling to admit the new
petitioner into the circle of -his literary
lares and penates. It seems boorish for
a strange songster to attempt to break
into the charmed circle of the gods en
shrined.
But Herman Scheffaur has boldly
mapped out his campaign for popularity
by providing a striking array af poetical
wares for the suspicious and grudging pub
lic to choose from. In "Of Both Worlds"
âthe typical Browning title of poetical
ambiguity which names his verse book,
the Oakland bard offers philosophy, mys
ticism, misanthropy, sarcasm. You take
your choice.
good can come out of Nazareth,
Herman Scheffaur, with his lately pub
lished volume of verse, is ready to lay
claim thereunto.
ANEW poet has arisen In Oakland
to snatch ihe freshly rejuvenated
laurels from off the snowy brow
of Joaquln Miller.' If anything
Â¦He puts especial weight ..upon the demand that this process begin by direct creation of the
fundamental law. He says that the labor unions demand this, to the end that their rights may be en
trenched in the constitution; and he intimates that their strength is sufficient, by direct action, to
make constitutions to suit themselves. This is a clear declaration that the fundamental law is to be
made in the interest of a class, that has classified itself, and gone out to be a separate and distinct
part of the community, using the power of organization to effect an extension of its own rights, re
gardless of the limitation imposed by the rights of others.
The hieii who made the constitution of the United States were of many professions and call
ings and occupations. They sought to create a fundamental law in which the commoii Â¦ rights' of all
men were entrenched and protected and defended. In the eye of that great law all rights are equal.
It is the majestic flower of the common law, that code developed out of the contacts of men and their
interests in a state of civilization. In it the great writs of liberty and 1 the judicial processes for their
enforcement are protected and under ft there is only such limitation of the rights of man as are neces
sary to perfect equality.
To change such a constitution and replace it by one made by a class and for a class is to ob
solete republican government. It has been said that a community made up of Isaac Newtons would
become a mob in trying to administer governments by the methods .proposed by Governor Garvin.
With no rationalizing force in its system and with the power to constantly change its fundamental
law, it would be subject in its very foundations to the erratic changes and impulsive passions of the
popular majority. Men accustomed briefly to a constitutional definition <3f their rights would find
those rights changed or abolished in a day by a shifting of the popular passions, and finally all sub
jected to that system would discover that they had no government at all, and the outcome of the ex
periment would realize the dream of the anarchists.
Governor Garvin calls attention to the favor in which these ideas arc held in New England.
That is true, but the stock of New Ehgjana people has been so changed by an overgrowth of foreign
immigration that no one should make the mistake of assuming that these novelties in government
arc the sobc>- concisions of that New England t-entrment which aided in founding our present system
of government The. change lusted for by Governor Garvin is otic that would be wrought by the men_
who have sought this country as an asylum from systems under which men arc governed too much
and who have not loyally sought to study our system,, but who condemn it because all restraint of the
law chafes their untamed will.
Ml\. GARVJN,. the Democratic Governor of Rhode, Island, exploits in the North American
Review his ideas in favor of the abolition of representative government in this country
and the substitution therefor of direct government by the initiative, referendum and direct
legislation. He proposes more than this, that the people shall, without reference to any
body of representatives, initiate changes in the constitution of any State or of the Federal Govern
ment, and shall thereby change at will the fundamental law. He insists that statutes passed by the
people directly shall not be subject to repeal or amendment by the legislature, while all legislative
statutes shall be subject* to both by direct action of the people.
On this branch of his subject he stops short of defining the status of the. courts in respect to
the statutes directly enacted. But the inference is plain that if they arc sacred from legislative inter
ference they must be also removed from the risk of judicial review. The proposition then is to ob
solete the legislative and judicial branches of the Government, substituting for both the action of the
people in their primitive capacity, with no rationalizing force to secure consistency, or even equity, in
such statutes as they choose to enact in the ballot-box.
Among his reasons it is declared that legislative bodies have become hopelessly corrupt. Yet
they are elected by the same people for whose benefit he proposes to obsolete two of the three co-ordi
nate branches of government. His argument is, therefore, that the people, proven incapable of cre
ating pure legislatures in the ballot-box, by that failure have proved their capacity to create pure
laws in the same ballot-box ! â¢ .

Judge Lindley said that by a uniform
line of decisions of. the Federal courts,
United States Supreme and Circuit, the re
ceiver named by the court of primary
jurisdiction who takes first charge of the
After Mr. Scott had left the stand Judge
Lindley continued his argument begun
Friday. The first proposition that he
brought up was the statement that the
Union Iron Works, while apparently pro
ceeding and conducting its affairs as an
Independent company,' was, as a matter
of fact, a part of the United States Ship
building Company, which owns the entire
plant and all the stock of the old Union
Iron Works. He said while the conduct
of its business has been so independent,
the decree of the New Jersey court has
practically brought it under the control
of . the Federal courts, with all of the
assets of the constituent plants, wherever
the same' are situated in the United
States; that the directors of the ship
building company have abandoned\their
functions, their president has resigned,
and unless this court recognizes the ac
tion of the New Jersey court in the ap
pointment of Mr. Smith as receiver, there
Is no one to represent its Interests In this
jurisdiction. The Union Iron Works
plant, while looked upon" popularly as be
ing an independent plant, is merely an
asset of the United States Shipbuilding
Company and must necessarily be dealt
with in the general wind-up of the af*
fairs of that company In the administra
tion of the general trust imposed by the
United States Circuit Court of New Jer
sey upon Mr. Smith as receiver, the at
torney said.
JUDGE LINDLEY ARGUES.
HENRY T. SCOTT, chairman of
the board of directors of the
Union Iron Works, was recalled
to the witness stand in the
United States Circuit Court yes
terday and testified that there is little or
no profit made in building battleships for
the Government. He stated that the con
tract for the Wisconsin amounted 'to
$2,500,000 and that after three years' labor
the builders only made $14,000 profit.
This testimony was given in the pro
ceedings brought by Roland Bi Conklln
and other stockholders in the United
States Shipbuilding Company, the gigantic
corporations which owns nearly all
of the big shipyards of the coun
try. The' Mercantile Trust Company
of New York Is combating v the
attempt made by the complainants to
have a receiver appointed. Mr. Scott has
already testified that a receiver was un
necessary, as the Union Iron Works is a
solvent corporation. Judge^ Curtis H.
Lindley of this city and Henry Wollman
of New York, who represent the small
stockholders, have secured the appoint
ment of ex-Senator James Smith Jr. of
New Jersey as receiver for various ship
yards which belong to the trust. They
have appealed to Judge Beatty to appoint
him to look after the local shipyard and
have suggested that Henry T. Scott might
act as his agent. Vast Interests are in
volved and the case is attracting a great
deal of attention throughout the United
States.
Henry T. Scott was recalled to the wit
ness stand to enlighten the court about
the profits derived from building battle
ships for the Government. He furnished
a typewritten statement to the court and
counsel and requested that It not be filed,
as the information, was of a private char
acter. The shipbuilder was interrogated
by Mr. Wollman. '.'}'
"After tho United States Shipbuilding
Company took charge of the property
here did It make any change in the presi
dency?" Mr. Scott was asked. .
"Yes, sir. It changed the by-laws and
mado the chairman the chief officer."
"Was Mr. Dodge made president?"
"Yes, 6lrâ by tho directors, at the re
quest of the United States Shipbuilding
Company." - '
"Did they send the auditor out here?"
"Yes, sir; Mr. Hart came here."
"Did they send Mr. Jeffries out here?"
"Yes, sir."
1'What did he do?"
"He -was to take charge of the ship
yardâlook, after, the building of battle
ships."

MB. SCOTT IS RECALLED.
Judge Lindley quoted numerous author- |
ities of the Federal courts on the question ;
of .receivership, showing that it was the
uniform practice with the Federal courts
in the domicile of the corporation placing !
a receiver in charge that all other Federal i
courts by comity recognize that receiver
and confirm his appointment. He said the
confirmation of Mr. Smith's appointment
in this Jurisdiction will in no way inter
fere with the proper completion of the
Government contracts, as Is manifest
from a telegram from Secretary Moody to
the receiver read in evidence yesterday.
The opposition to the appointment of a
receiver comes from a majority of the
first mortgage bondholders united with
what is known as the reorganization com
mittee, which Is said to be under the con
trol of Mr. Schwab. In speaking on this
point Judco Lindley said:
' "By the increase of the capita! stock
of the United States Shipbuilding Com
pany and the subsequent transfer to it of
the stock of the Bethlehem Steel Com
pany Mr. Schwab became practically In
control of the United States Shipbuilding
Company, and his stock, representing a
voting power of $30,000,000 out of $45,000,000,
gave him control of the United States
Shipbuilding Company and of the reor
ganization committee, which now opposed
the appointment of a receiver. The plan
of this reorganization, committee presents
to the bona fide bondholders and stock
holders the option of either acceding to
the plan which will postpone their stocks
and bonds to a prior Hen to be. created in
favor of the Bethlehem Steel Company
(which is Schwab), or take the conse
quences of the foreclosure of the first
bond issue and the total wreckage of the
entire assets of the shipbuilding company.
There is a serious question as to the bona
fide Issuance of a great many of the first
mortgage bonds. It Is claimed that many
were issued without consideration and
that these bonds formed a part of the
pool, which has accepted the plan of re
organization and Is now opposing the ap
pointment of a receiver. This Is a mat
ter, however, to be determined In the suit
to be brought by the receiver. All of
Schwab's holdings, consisting of $30,000,000
of voting power out of $45,000,000, has
been lodged with the reorganization com
mittee, the plan of which gives Schwab a
seven-year voting trust and control of the
reorganized company for that length -of
time.
case In the domicile of .the corporation Is
appointed as a matter of course to take
charge of the assets in the ancillary Ju
risdiction. "This receiver, when ap
pointed, will act for all parties,- including
bondholders and stockholders," he said.
"The recognition by the California Fed
eral courts of Mr., Smith as receiver will
in no way tend to impede the operation of
tho Union Iron Works' plant. Ever since
the United States Shipbuilding Company
was organized the Union Iron Works, and
Mr. 8cV)tt as the head of its executive di
rectory, have acted purely as the agents
and representatives of the United States
Shipbuilding Company. There is no rea
son why Mr. Smith, when .once recognized
as receiver in this jurisdiction, should not
confer upon Mr. Henry T. Scott, as his
agent, the same powers which Mr. Scott is
now exercising as the agent of the United
States Shipbuilding Company. In other
words the business of the United States
Shipbuilding Company as heretofore car
ried on will be carried on at the Union
Iron Works' plant without interruption."

intendent of Schools Langdon as, to
whether or not the salary of a Deputy Su

In the Democratic camp the County

There are indications that a- heavy Re
publican vote will be cast at the prjmary

Forty-first Assembly districts, 'where
considerable opposition to the United Re
publican League exists. The sharpest
fight of tbÂ«e day will probably take place

ments made by Nolan.
led him to mistrust anything the defend
ant might say. There were only two miti
g/rting circumstances in the defendant's
favor. One was that he had pleaded
guilty and the court had made it a rule
in all such cases to deduct one-third off
the sentence. ' The other was that Mrs.
Mathews had testified that, although the
defendant took part In the robbery, he
did not take part in the assault upon her
and disapproved of the brutal assault by
Whitelaw.
- The crime committed, however, waB a
very serious one; in fact, he did not
know of one more serious. If people's
households were not safe during the ab
sence of their natural protectors and
women were terrified by men and beaten
and robbed, no household would be safe.
Nolan had a smile on his face, but when
tire Judge' sentenced him tQ twenty-five
years the smile faded away and he looked
as if some one had struck him a blow.
Docia Nolan has already been sentenced
to eight years in San Quentln and the
trial of John Davis, the last member of
the gang, will be held on August 17, un
less in the meantime he comes into court
and pleads guilty. Superior Judge Charles

peared to lake a keen interest in the pro
ceedings.

Evansville Blot Verdict.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 2, 1903.
Attorney Schooler then addressed . the
Judge and said x he .believed in his heart
that Mike Nolan was Innocent of" the
crime and that he was never inside 543
( HaIght street. Schooler defended Docia
Nolan and was familiar with all the facts
in the case.
BYINOTON AIiLEQES PEBJTTBY.
District Attorney Bylngton said that
Nolan had been placed on the stand to
commit deliberate perjury. Nolan was
the instigator of the crime and was in the
house to see that it was carrled^tnto ef
fect. He thought it was wrong for an at
torney to permit his client to commit per
jury when asking for the mercy of , the
court.
The Judge in passing sentence said it
was an immaterial point whether the de
fendant was inside or outside' the* house,
as he aided and abetted the crime. He
could not overlook the fact of his former
experience with the defendant when ha
was called upon to sentence him, which
Mrs. Mathews was called in rebuttal
and said she never told Mrs. Pearson
that she could only identify Whltelaw.
She swore positively that Nolan was the
man who had the umbrella and bolted the
door. In answer to the Judge she said
that when Whltelaw was beating her on
the head with hia revolver Nolan said:
"For God's sake, don't strike her any
more; she has had enough."
Mrs. Tuttle was called and denied that
her mother had ever said in her presence
to Mrs. Pearson that she could not iden
tify two of the men. f
meeting him In the City Prison, but j
when his attorney saw the contradiction j
he eot Nolan to say he did not knowi
Whitelaw by name. In cross-examination !
.by the District Attorney Nolan said he
had pleaded guilty, although an innocent |
man, because public sentiment and the
press were against him and he could not
get a lawyer to defend him. He denied
ever having been inside 543 Haight street
in his life. Docla Nolan, he said, was
not his wife, but she was innocent of any
participation in the crime. He said all
the witnesses for the prosecution were
mistaken In their evidence so far as he
was concerned. He was now 38 years of
age.
Nolan was then sworn and repeated the
statement already published as to his
movements prior to and after the robbery.
Ho said he never knew Whltelaw prior to
SAYS HE IS INNOCENT.
When Nolan's case was called Attorney
Schooler asked leare to present evidence
in mitigation of punishment. He called
William Durham, a pressman, who testi
fied to having seen Nolan standing at the
southwest corner of Haight and Fillmore.
He had been playing cards In the saloon
on. the' corner -Â»nd' had run out as some
one had come ' in asking that a police
whistle be blown, as a woman was being
shot. or murdered along the block. Wit
ness heard a woman's screams when he
got ouUide.
Mrs._J.- S._ Pierson. 218. Stelner. street,
a sister of Docla Nolan, testified that
shortly : after the robbery she called upon
Mrs. Mathews, . who testified that sho
could easily Identify the man who beat
her, but she could not be sure as to the
other two men. In cross-examination by
the District Attorney she said she could
not ' remember who were present at the
time, although admitting there were sev
eral people. Mrs. Mathews had said the
'man who had the umbrella was an old
man.
As the Judge _ pronounced the sentence
of life imprisonment there was a buzz
throughout the court room and
Whltelaw, folding his arms across his
breast, sat down after a defiant look at
the spectators in court. He did not move
a muscle, and after taking his seat turned
with a smile to Nolan and said something
to him.
The Judge In passing sentence said there
was . absolutely nothing sho-nm' In mitiga
tion . of the crime of the prisoner. The
crime of which he had been convicted was
one. calling for the severest penalty the
law could -Impose. It was great good luck
that the prisoner was not convicted of
murder in the first desree: it was cer
tainly not his fault that murder was not
committed. ' - ' "

Stock Clean-Upi
When opportunity offers, such as we present in this, our Annual .Clean- w
Up, there are always plenty who appreciate the difference between real o
cuts in fair prices and the imaginary reductions of 'so-called sales. 8
We have had many discriminating, customers during the first days of H
the. Clean-Up. They have purchased freely from knowledge of values. X
We have had others who accepted our statements as to values, knowinsr w
our reputation. All have been satisfied, because they have received 2
really good shoes at really low prices. Â§
There are many short lines to be sold during- this Clean-Up. and we jff
have made prices that should sell them. The shoes are standard makes g
of known value, and only the incompleteness of lines causes reductions 5;
in price. We much prefer, from a business standpoint, to lay in com- . Â§
plete new lines to filling up sold-out sizes. You profit by this, for our $>
prices carry out this policy. *

Bon for believing that. the outcome of the
conclave, will be as- follows: Cardinal
Rampolia, having secured' the greatest
number, of votes, but not sufficient to
elect, will withdraw In favor of Angelo
Ql Pietro, prodatary of the late Pope, who
is his intimate -frined and co-worker, and
who, if elected, will name Domencio Fer
ratl, prefect of V the Congregation of
Bishops and Regulars, as his Secretary of
State.

Another of the Cardinals, Archbishop
of Lyons Coullle, has fallen ill. Cardinal
Herrera y.Espinosa. It. is learned. Is suf
fering from heart disea.se. Cardinal Cre
toni. In a moment of 'prostration from
heat, insisted that he wanted to leave
the conclave, saying he. could not remain
confined any longer, but he was prevent
ed doing* so by his colleagues, who. in
turn, keep him company. Cardinal Lan
gtnieux Is still 111.
The-. two Invalid Cardinals are reported
to be somewhat better. The Cardinal*
who, like Cardinal Gibbons, have rooms
with full, southern exposure, found the
heat at midday almost unbearable.
"The afternoon ballot ended at 6 o'clock,
when the crowd - saw the ! smoke of the
burning ballots ascending from the chap
el.. Owing to the lateness of the hour at
which the burning of the ballots took
place, many rumors became current and
hope was even entertained that a new
Pope had been elected.
It was said on good authority that
Cardinals Herrera and Langenleux were
unable to leave their Vcell3" this morn
ing, so that when the time came for vot
ing, immediately after .having taken . to
the altar his own vote. Cardinal Oreglia
showed the members of the Sacred Col
lege a small empty box having a tiny
slit in the cover. This box was locked Â«n
the presence'of alf'the Cardinals and the
key was placed on the altar, after wh'.cn
the three Cardinal scrutineers carried the
box to' the apartments , of ... the invalids,
who, after .. taking the , prescribed oa.tn,
dropped their ballots .through Â¦ the silt into
the* box, which was taken back the
Slstine Chapel,'\ unlocked and ;t>e.- ballot j
deposited with those of the other Cardin
als in the chalice on It he altar.
The ballotirig this afternoon did not dif
fer in/form from .that of this inorning.
From what leakedout from the conclave
It does not appear that much progress has
been made toward a*,result, although it
is said that the Rampolia; party remains
compact; with, a" tendency to increase Its
strength.,. ? i.Y';; .
of their colleagues.
After the balloting was finished tho
chalice was covered and well shaken and
the ballots were publicly counted. Then,
passing them into a receptacle. placed on
the table in the center of, the chape!, tho
two Cardinal scrutineers opened tho first
ballot and passed it to a- third Cardinal,
who read it out in a loud voice and the
other Cardinals noted the votes on a
printed list of names with which each
was provided.
As no Cardinal received the urescribe'i
two-thirds of the votes- a supplementary
ballot was taken, with no better result.
Consequently, at 11:20 o'clock, ail of the
ballots were - burned, the smoke beir.g
seen from, the left side of the piazza* of
St. Peter's, where a few curious persons,
mostly ; newspaper, men. had gathered to
record this rrute message.
. HONOLULU,. Aug. 1.â As a result of the
recent disbarment proceedings! in the Su
preme -Coiirt in connection with the case
of Johh Samner, whose fortune dwindled

the Rev. J. Lynch of Niagara, . has Jtjst
arrived her*. Before leaving the United
States Father Lynch received *.a '. letter
from Monsignor Bisletto, master . of " the} .
chamber at the Vatican, expressing 1 tho
approval of the late Pope tor' the â¢pil
grimage from the United States and "say
ing that Leo XIII would be pleased to re-"

fearing the .death of the Pope, -njews jjf,
which was received when " .the- Azores
were reached. The pilgrim* wllr .remain
In Rome until "Wednesday nfext. '. . ' 'i .
So saying, the Cardinal dropped his bal
lot. Into -the rhallce, bowed. before tho al
ia r and returned 'to his place. Â¦_
-The balloting took* a Lvcry long time,
as. many of .the Cardinals, o wins to their
advanced age i and '{. illness,- moved; slowly
and : were obliged to havo' tho assistance
The chapel presented a picture of much
animation and beauty. .Violet was the
leading note of color. Â¦ Six candles on the
altar gave a peculiar light, in conjunction
with the daylight streaming through the
windows and gleaming on -the empty
throne and on the long- line of seats, with
their baldachinos (canopies), occupied by
the Cardinals intent upon the business in
hand. Everything was - symbolic. Even
the balachinos, which were now. raised
over the Cardinals' chairs in the, Sistine
Chapel, are a sign that each member, of
the Sacred College has a personal. part in
the sovereignty of the Apostolic See, but
when a Pope is elected they are removed,
the new Pontiff alone remaining with this
symbol of power. Â»
The Cardinals went to the Sistlne
Chapel, accompanied by their conclavists,
carrying portfolios and papers. When
Cardinal Oreglia was seated, all of the
others following his example, prayers
were offered, after which the governot of
the conclave called, "Exit omnes,". thus
announcing to the conclavists and pre
lates that they must retire and leave the
Cardinals alone.
The voting papers used by their Emi
nences are somewhat different from those
of 1878, being a little longer and nar
rower, but the printed inscriptions are
the. same, the blank spaces being' filled
in at the moment of voting, with the name
of the voter at the top and that of the
Cardinal voted for in the center and a
Latin quotation at the bottom.
Some of the Cardinals did not know
how to fold , their â¢ papers, which caused
considerable .confusion. ; Cardinal Oreglia,
the camerllngo, demonstrated the folding
of a ballot to t,hose near: him and they
in turn showed . others> how Â¦, it must be
folded. Each ballot, was sealed, with no
distinguishing mark. ':. ~ ', â¢ . *
Each Cardinal, in turn, /holding his bal
lot' between "his first ; finger,, and g thumb,
so that every one present could sec U,~ ad
vanced slowly to the altar, where' a long
chalice was- standing, knelt and prayed
briefly, for guidance, and then rising, took
the folowlng.oath:
I call i God to witness, he who shall Judge
me. that 1 elect him who I think should be
elected according to God. This I promise to do
also In the acce^slst vote. ,<
Then the great business of the day was
at hand. At 10 o'clock all the Cardinals
assembled in the Slstlno Chapel for the
first: ballot.
â¢: Many were the grumblings at the un
comfortable beds, the heat, the odors and
other discomforts endured, one Cardinal
declaring he had not slept a wink because
of the moscuitoes. Â¦' - ,
Breakfast, consisting of coffee and rolls,
followed. This was partaken of private
ly by the Cardinals in their cells.
+__ -V . +
by the ringing of a loud bell to realize
the solemn business before them. Mass
was said in the Pauline Chapel by Car T
.dinal Oceglia, the camerllngo, who after
ward administered communion to each
Cardinal. The scene was majestic when
the members of the" Sacred College, as
humble communicants, advanced to > re
ceive the communion from the hands of
the camerllngo, who gave subsequently a
short address on the solemn nature of the
occasion. After this each Cardinal cele
brated another mass, either at an altar
in the Sala Ducaleor in his own rooms, at
a movable altar prepared for the pur
pose. '

METHUEN. Mass:, Aug. 1.â Ansered to
Â¦ the pohit of bitterness, Edward F. Searles,
Mtthuen's eccentric millionaire, hero of a
romantic courtship which brought him
one of .America'* greatest fortunes, victor
in a will contest more noted at the time
than that of Tilden, patron of the arts,
and of late practically a recluse within
the' beauties of his walled estate, an
nounces his determination to leave the
town forever airti return * to California,
where by marrying the widow of Mark
Hopkins he obtained the immense fortune
which now affords him a fabulous yearly
Income.
Here at Methuen, his birthplace, he
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in
building and for works of art. and
planned great things for the town. The
people also expected great things of him."
But now all is changed. " He says that
the people do not appreciate what he has
done for them and their town. Just where
they failed to show reverence he does not
state, nor do they know. Friction with
his near neighbors had not increased his
respect for them, but it was thought that
he was well disposed toward the town as
a whole until last week. When the time
for fixing up the Old Home Week pro
gramme was at hand ho was asked to
subscribe, and a generous response was
looked for. The answer came in the form
of a very tart note. It read:
' "Inasmuch as the townspeople have not
shown a proper appreciation of what I
have done for the town, I shall not con
tribute a dollar.". â¢

'â¢ROME,. Aug. Lâ The Cardinals were all
awakened at ' an Â¦ early hour this * mornlnir
PROCESS OF THE BALLOTING.
Smoke Ascending From Vatican An
.nounces^'No Result J' - ''"'
From the crowd came a sigh of. relief.
Still watching, with necks craned, they
saw the smoke thicken and then die down,
down, and in two minutes all^traces "of
to-day's futile voting had vanrehed into
air.' 1
Slowly and with much speculation as to
what had occurred within' the' conclave
"and the likelihood of an election to-mor
row, the crowds dispersed. The historic
method of giving the world the only in
formation it is supposed to get regarding
the election of a Pope had served its pur
pose with dramatic thoroughness.
During the afternoon women were busy
In St. Peter's preparing the great window
facing the interior of the basilica, from
which the new Pope, immediately after
his election.- will give his first benediction
to the Catholic world.
A number of diplomatists accredited to
the Holy See have during the day stopped
at the wicket gate without having any
communication with those in the con
clave. ' /
. The most interesting period at the wick
ets is when postal and other communica
tions for the ' Cardinals, conclavists and
the others secluded within the precincts
of the conclave are received after : being
examined: by the marshal and the govern
ment of the conclave. ... . â¢> .Â¦
The latest reports are to, the effect that
the condition of the Cardinals who are ill
has somewhat Improved. The rules of the
conclave allow a Cardinal who Is suffer
ing from illness to leave and to even re
turn If he so desircr. â¢
ing office with an ever watchful eye on the
Sistlne Chapel. The suspense became in
tense. Even the street urchins, who had
come in large numbers to gather the dis
carded ends of cigarettes thrown away
by the nervous men, stopped thelr x work
and gazed toward the chapel. â¢
Several false alarms of "Ecco la efu
mata" (There Is the smoke) caused a thrill
of excitement. Then came- a- rumori that
a Pope had been elected,-. and .many per
sons rushed to the basilica to get good
seats when the announcement should -be
made. The impression that" a choice had
been reached was heightened by the ap
pearance upon the walls of the yatican
of a few officials in full uniform as if for
a gTeat ceremony.
When 6 o'clock boomed out from i the
big clock of St. Peter's there was. a sea
of upturned faces focused with intense an
ticipation on the Slstine Chapel's crooked
smokestack.
Three minutes later came another cry.
This time it was true. From the conical
top of the chapel curled out a tiny streak
of smoke, so light, so faint that it was
scarcely distinguishable even against the
deep blue of the cloudless Italian sky.
SIGNALS FUTILITY OF BALLOT.
FALSE RUMOB OF ; ELECTION.
The. bells of the basilica rang out the
call to vespers, but none went in. The
priests, pacing . the . steps of St. Peter's,
prayer books In hand, muttered the even-
5*o one here seriously expected the Car
dinals to select a Pontiff on the first bal
lot; hence this morning few of the popu
lace were present In the piazza of St.
Pefer's, though in the Immediate neigh
borhood 1000 troops and gendarmes stood
idle in the shade of the colonnade. This
afternoon the sun blazed down and St.
Peter's at 4 o'clock was just as deserted
as on the day Pope Leo died. .
Soon after A o'clock, however, crowds
began to gather. First came .the priests
and monks of all denominations, in their
queer colored cassocks, and women from
the poorer parts of -the -city carrying or
dragging children with them. By 5 o'clock^
several thousands persons, Including many'
American tourists, hundreds of priests
and. anxious Romans of all classes, gath
ered at the steps of the basilica and along
the left side of St. Peter's Square, from
which points -only was the Sistine^Chapel
visible. Every eye was turned toward the
long, narrow tin tube, with a conical top,
which rises crookedly from 'one end of
the chapel. It might well be an impro
vised smoke outlet for a hovel instead of
the world- watched beacon, which alone
can- give the sign awaited by so many
millions of people.
As eve drew near the crowd increased
and Roman princes and princesses drove
up and watched A from their carriages
through opera glasses the tln'ifmokestack
which glistened in the sun. Prince Or
sini, the head of the Roman nobility, who
shares only with Prince Colonna the ,
hereditary right to stand next to the Papal
throne, sat on the steps of St. Peter's
beside an old beggar woman. Like her he
watched Intently for the smoke signal, but
no smoke came.
CROWDS BEGIN TO GATHER.
ROME, Aug. 1.â The first day of
the conclave has ended and no
Pope has been elected. Both this
morning and this afternoon all of
the members of the Sacred Col
leg*, except Cardinals Herrero y Espl
nosu. Crctoni. Langenieux and Couelll,
who were confined to their cells by Ill
ness, entered the Sistlne Chapel, where,
after the solemn ritual appointed for the
occasion, they dropped their ballots Into
the chalice. That these gave to no can
didate the necessary forty-two votes was
made known to Rome and the world by
the smoke of burning: ballots "Â«Â»iich issued
from the Sistlne Chapel. To-morrow the
Cardinals will vote again, both in the
morning and afternoon, but what Â¦ the
chances of their arriving at a decision be
fore Monday are, none can tell.
It was reported this evening 1 that the
Rampolia party was in the ascendant,
but this cannot be taken as any indica
tion of the tlnal result, as the vote for
Pope Leo's Secretary of State may be
split up or given in Us entirety to some
other Cardinal. Apparently reliable In
formation, which, however. It Is Impos
sible to verify, is to the effect that Car
dinal Rampolia received on the first bal
lot this morning 20 votes: Serafino Van
nuetelU, 12: Gotti, 7; Oreglia. 5; Di Pletro,
4; Capecelatro, 4. and Agliardi, 3, the re
mainder' being scattered. Rumor general
ly assigns Monday as the most likely day
upon which an election will occur.

by greatly surprised, as it was expected
that IÂ»uclen Appleby would bring in the

Thjs : was. 'â¢"getaway" day at the Metro
"pontan Jockey Club track and this, cou

Special Dispatch to The Cail.
Jeffries speaks in the highest praise of
his Becretary, "Kid" Egan, .as a "house
couriter," and the Jeffries camp folks look'
forward to the figuring up of the receipts ;
and tho handing over to the boilermaker
the long end of the purse as the only bit
of laborious or tiresome work ahead of
them. Billy Delaney offered to bet to-day
there would be more than '40,000 in tho
Pavilion on the night of the battle, and !
there were no takers. As the Jeffries-
Fitzsimmons and Jeffries-Ruhlin fights
each drew more than 30,000, Delaney's
contention looks plausible.
For "the next ten days the champion's
work will be laid out with the sole object
of attaining speed. While his . present
weight is close to 230 pounds, his muscles
stand out like twenty-dollar rolls In a
coin broker's tray, and his akin is bronzed
and firm and tough-looking as a ferry
boat beefsteak. This latter fact waa viv
idly illustrated when Jeffries was bitten
by Brownie, the bear. Bob Fitzsimmons,
with needle and thread, attempted to sew
up the wound, but found the skin so
tough that the needle failed to puncture
it, and a hammer was used to drive it
through.
To-day, for the first time, Jeff and Fltz
put on the gloves. While the two rounds
were not marked by any particularly
rough work, Fitzsimmons, who usually
hits things up at a lively clip, cut out
quite a pace for. the champion. He made
a runaway bout of it, stopping suddenly
to slip in a left swing or a straight jab,
as it Is figured these tactics will be adopt
ed by Corbett. Jeffries complained of
feeling none too spry when he arose this
morning, being a bit stiff from sprinting
the night before after the dinner hour.
He retired without a rubdown, and as a
consequence his speed to-day was dolled,
and nobody was more conscious of it than.
Jeffries himself.
Besides the two rounds with the Aus
tralian Jeff also boxed two lively rounds
each with Jack Jeffries and Joe Kennedy.
Bag punching and sparring will be in
order from now on, road work being en
tirely eliminated. Â¦ Â¦ â¢ ' -'
If "Red Shirt" Gordon, late of FolsomT,
or any of the other gentry whose notions
of â¢' endeavoring to live likcJ. Pierpont
Morgan â¢ putting :in eight hour$
a day, and an unquenchable desire for
clothing with gay stripes, usually finds
them working for some State institution;
arÂ» loitering in this vicinity. they will do
'Â¦well-, to give Harbin 8pringsr e wide berth.
Jim Jeffries, is a crack shot, which was
demonstrated, this evening. With a 22
caliber rifle he dropped a bird that was
hopping about in a fig tree fully 100 yards
distant, with a shot straight through tha
heart. He then repeatedly perforated, a
can thrown in the air by John Marke
witz, the Oakland restaurateur, a great
admirer of the champion's prowess.
Tommy Ryan's defl did not appear to
'ruffle Bob Fitzsimmons' feelings or even
ruffle his placid features. He recalled
the fact of having posted vOOO in New
York some months ago to fight the astute
Tommy at 158 pounds and which money
remained uncovered. "Now," said Bob,
"somebody has informed Ryan that 'Phil
adelphia Jack' O'Brien has gone to
Europe and that I tip the scales at 200
pounds, so Tommy thought himself due
to spring a fresh one." Possibly when
Ryan recovers his health the elongated
Australian will talk business with him.

corners to be filed' oft and rounded, but

FLYCASTING CONTESTS
RESUMED AT STOW LAKE
The O'Keefe-Britt fiasco was the chief
topic of conversation yesterday among
ring followers. All effort to fix the re
sponsibility for the affair proved unavail
ing; as the parties chiefly concerned
shifted the blame from one to another.
Public confidence in the affair was
shaken from the start by the utterance a
of Hart, O^eefe's Chicago manager.
Matters were not helped by "Willie Britt
being quoted upon his arrival here as
speaking authoritatively tor O'Keefe.
Britt subsequently denied the accuracy -of
the interview.
If Hart's statements had any basis of
truth and there was an understanding be
tween the boxers, all mu3t have been de
clared off forty-eight hours before the
fight. At that time the betting had set
tled and it was evident no money was to
bÂ« made In that direction. It was also
known that tho house would not be as
large as O'Keefe was originally given to
understand it would be.
There to not the slightest doubt In the
minds of competent trainers but that
O'Keefe can make 133 pounds. The bulk
of his weight was about his waist and
with steady work it would have melted
away.
The Britts blame Greggalns, claiming
he had an ulterior motive In having Jim
my defeated. The officials of the club,
erred in not keeping informed as to tha
condition of the men, thus protecting the
patrons of boxing.
Greggain3 passes the buck up to Al
Smith, saying he took his word for
O'Keefe' s condition. Smith in turn says
he never saw O'Keefe weigh and that ho
took O*Keefe's word in the matter.
Britt Is out his training expenses but
expects to offset this loss with the -$230
forfeit money ho Is to receive) from Al
Smith. This money was in the hands of
the stakeholder for some time. It was
drawn down when Britt's money was not
forthcoming.
On Friday evening it was announced
that those who held tickets for the fight
would have their money refunded by
calling at Corbett's yesterday. It was
later decided by Alex Greggins to refund
the money at headquarters of the San
Francisco Athletic Club on Sixth street.
Ticket scalpers soon learned of this order
and for sums averaging from twenty-five
to fifty cents they bought the tickets of
a large number of men who did not wish
to bo put to the inconvenience. of having
to go way down to Sixth street to get
their money refunded.
Some of the people who paid to tret
Into the gallery have a grievance. The
supply of tickets was reported exhausted
before all the spectators had been pro
vided with the checks redeemable at $1
each. The lights were then put out and
the Pavilion was cleared. This left sev
eral hundred people without anything tD
show for their dollar. â¢ -
Victory has at last landed In the camp
of the Oakland baseball cripples. It hov
ered around the heads of both teams for
nearly two hours yesterday at Recreation
Park "and seemed uncertain where 10
alight. - Finally Peter's gentle ways or
the influence of the fans prevailed and
so the struggle came to a peaceful close,
with the Cripples barely one ahead. Score,
2 to 1.
They deserved the victory, those icr
lorn followers of Peter Lohman. Every
minute of the time the battle was In
progress they were trying and played ball
good enough to win in any one's league.
They outhit the Angels' and fielded far
better than the southerners. Not an er
ror was charged against them. tlA ths
final round, when Francks booted one
from Dillon's bat.
The old story that the Angels could not
connect with the elusive offerings of a
southpaw was nothing but truth yester
day. In every round they were simp!/
mystified by the queer assortment of tun
glers shot up by Mr. Graham. Try as
they might, the ball refused to keep out
of the way of the waiting and ever
ready fielders.
Gray, for the Angels, also handled him- '
self with a deal of grace, but his twirl
ing was a shade worse than that of Gra
ham. He gave three bases on balls and
two of them resulted in runs. Graham
allowed two runners to walk to the first
bag. One of these also came over the
rubber eventually.
Mosklman registered the initial tally of
the game during the progress of the sec
ond inning. Gray passed him and then
Gorton swung on a wild pitch and sent
it out to right field for a single. This put
the M. D. on the third bag. Then Mes
serly hit one to Wheeler and the latter
passed the ball to Toman. He, in turn,
threw to Pillon, completing a fast double
play, but they tould cot prevent Moskl
man from making the final turn of the
bases.
Again in the sixth the Cripples landed.
For the last time Francks accepted
Gray's generosity and footed it to the
first bag. He promptly pilfered the sec
ond sack and finished the trip when
Moose sent the ball out to right field. In
the eighth the "Cripples came dangerously
near scoring another. Schwartz had sin
gled and went around to third on the
Moose's second bang. Mosklman filed to
Hoy find the dummy threw Schwartz out
at tho plate by a fast return of the ball.
The only "Angel tally was made in the
eighth round. Ross walked and Toman
sent him around to third with "a hit. As
Spies was going through the ordeal of be
ing put out ' by the Francks-Messerly
process Ross hotfooted it to the rubber.
In the last round, the Angels got Dillon
as far as third and Cravath rested on
second, but Ross failed to make good with
a hit and then the last chance was gone
and the Cripples had won a game, which
may be their last for several days. The
score:

Secretary White of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children has had
a most distressing case reported to him â
that of Mrs. Caroline Gilbert and her fam
ily, living at 559 Edinburgh street, In the
Insleside district. The woman, who is of
Swedish nationality. Is the mother of
seven children, two of whom are feeble
minded and one, a boy, in the last stages
of consumption. The woman was desert
ed by her husband several years ago,
and since that time Mrs. Gilbert has been
struggling as a charwoman to support the
entire family. The oldest girl, Caroline
Gilbert. ID years of age, is feeble-minded,
but takes care of the home while the
mother Is out working. Nellie, the second
girl, is in perfect health, and through the
kind offices of a friend is attending a
business college. Eugene, 13. is attending
a grammar school. Lewis, 11. is dying of
consumption. William; 8, Is feeble-mind
ed, and there are twins, a boy and a girl,
aged 6 years.
When Secretary White called at the
house to make an Investigation the moth
er Immediately became afraid that the
feeble-minded children would be taken
from her charge, and she p'.eaded for
hours with him not to remove them from
home. The house Is in a filthy condition,
and White thinks that the feeble-minded

White has not yet declde.d what cojir.se he
will pursue. .[â¢'Â¦ 'Â¦_..'Â¦ . â¢ *
The legend, "per H. C. W. A.." which
Hammer attached to the bottom of the
receipt, has been found to be probably
the initials of a friend of his by the name
of Aftnn. of whom he had been heard to
speak.
Steward Todd tells a straightforward
story of his connection with the' case. He
aald yesterday:
When Hammer came into the office we were
nil out of the room, but when I returned I rec.
osnlzed him and copied that receipt on a type
writer without paying the matter a second
thought. When he had left I picked up the
rec'pt in handwriting, which he had dropped
ln the waste basket when I gave him the type
written copy. It looked strange and I put It In
a drawer, meaning to keep It to pee why such
a thing should be done by a private in the
corps.
Judge Advocate Morrow is certain that
Hammer, had no assistants in the medical
Fuperintendenfs office. lie said yester
day:
Major Rafferty and myself have Investigated
tho charges Hgainst Hammer and are certain
that he Is guilty. He will be court martlalea
mi the charge of absence without leave and ob
taining money under false pretense*. Hut we
are certain that no other member of the hospital
corps Is involved In the trouble, . since they
scarcely know the man.

I have told my suspicions to the officials in

will report the case to the office of the surgeon
general at Washington. I have also notified
Chief of Detectives Martin and he will investi
gate the case.

I ARMY TRANSPORT WHICH SAILED YESTERDAY FOR MANILA, LEAV
ING PORT IN COMPANY WITH THE STEAMSHIP NEWPORT.
I WHICH WAS FORMERLY IN THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE.
On the following day Mrs. Lever re
ceived a note from Hammer saying that
he was coming to bring ner the passage
tickets. The next day she got. a letter
from Hammer, dated at Los Angeles, in
which he assured her that he would see
her before the transport Sheridan exiled
on August 1. Mr?. Lever then reported
the matter to Major Rafferty and Judge
Advocate Major Morrow. A warrant for
Hammer's arrest was immediately ' tele
graphed to I<os Angeles.
In stating her conviction that Hammer
is not the only guilty party Mrs. Lever,
when seen at her room at 10S O'Farrell
street, said:
I am certain that Hammer had an accomplice
in the office of the med'eal superintendent He
lneteteri on.mj ffolns; there for my receipt, and
when h* askeO Steward Todd to copy the re
ceipt. Todd did eo without showing any ttur
prise. lie must have known that Hammer ha-l
no business introducing us Into that office and
She demurred, but at Jast upon the In
sistent urging of Hammer consented to
accompany him. Hr.mmer took Mrs.
Lever and her daughter up to the office in
the Phelan building and there wrote her a
receipt, signing it iiev. C. W. Hamner.
At the time when F.ammer wrote the re
ceipt the office was empty, but upon the
entrance of Steward Todd Hammer In
troduced his companions to him and re
quested that Todd copy the receipt on the
typewriter. Todd did so and Hammer
threw the original receipt in the waste
basket.
TAKEN TO HEADQUABTEBS.
The authorities in the local office of the
hospital service maintain that Hammer
alone Is the guilty party and that Investi
gation has failed to show any reason for
supposing that he was assisted by ac
complices In their department
Hammer. It is alleged by Mrs. Lever,
was Introduced to her on board the trans
port Thomas, and learning that she
wished to get passage for herself, her
daughter Mary and her young son. vol
unteered to obtain It for her at a reduced
rate. Consequently on July 27 he collect
ed from her the $50 which he claimed was
the cost of the fare to Manna on cither
the Sheridan or Thomas, and asked that
she accompany him to the medical super
intendent's office to receive the receipt in
all official order.
Mrs. Mary Lever, who claims to have
been victimized out of $50 by the act of
C.W. Hammer, a private in the hospital
corps of the regular army, who guaran
teed her passage to Manila on the trans
port Sheridan for that .^consideration,
makes allegations affecting the integrity
of several of the stewards in the ofQce of
Medical Superintendent Major Rafferty
She declares that Hammer had confed
erates ln the office and that she will re
port the matter to the head of -the hospi
tal service at Washington.
Mrs. Lever bases her charges on tho
fact that Hammer took her to the office
of the medical superintendent in the Phe
lan building on July 27 and there had
Steward J. II. Todd copy on a typewriter
a receipt he had penned for the $50 paid
by her for the supposed privilege of pas
sage for herself and family to the Philip
pines.

"THE RUSSIAN WEPDINO/*
Effectively framed either > in
.Flemish brown,** eboijj^'or gilt
frame, tibout three * or tour
inches; framed closely. â¢""I would suggest that you employ an
engineer," eaid Grunsky. "to see to the
preparation of proper plans."
Dibble wanted Grunsky to act. but that
official said be had not the. time. Dibble
then apologized for anything he had said
that might be deemed offensive.
The board decided to meet again Mon
day morning, when Hewitt is expected to
submit the plans of the arch.
The board met In the aftfrnoqn to con
elder the matter. There /- were present
members of the G. A. U. committee and
City Enffineer Grunoky.
Chief Hewitt of the Department of
Electricity thought the work should be
allowed to go on. He considered that the
fact that the cables had supiwrted tho
platform for eight days was a proof of
their efficiency. Hewitt denied that It
was proposed to add any more weight
than it was first Intended to the cables.
"The work will not be allowed to pro
ceed," said Casey, "until plans showing
how much weight the cables will hold
have been submitted to this board."
"We will flna a way to go on with the
work." said Judge Dibble of the commit
tee, "even if we have to go to court.
Don't say the work shall not go on, for
I tell you that it will go on. You run up
against something: bigger than Hewitt
when you seek to stop the work simply
because Hewitt has not or does not want
to furnish plans."
"I want to serve notice on the G. A. R.
committee and the contractors," said
Casey, "that the work will not go on un
less proper plans, and specifications arc
furnished this board.' Mr. Hewitt, you
have not yet given us the necessary
plans."'
"We don't propose to suffer because two
departments of the city are quarreling,"
said Dibble. "This Is a big proposition.
Let us get. together as citizens for the
honor of the city and fix it up. It looked
to me once as though this board was
standing In with the contractors, who
probably would like to get out of tho
contract. Don't let us disgrace ourselves
in this way."
The Board of Public "Works ordered
yesterday that work on the G. A. R. or
namental arch cease. President Casey
directed Captain Spillane to take a squad
of men to the scene and seo that the
-workmen stop operations at once.
Supervising Engineer Henry J. "Wolters
of the Claus Spreckels building sent a
communication to the board In which hÂ«?
says fc<* deems the present arrangement
for securing the cables for the arch very
dangerous and a menace to public safety.
Wolters protests against' proceeding any
further with the work until a method of
securing the cables that will leave no dan
cer of the breaking of any of the stone
work is decided upon by the City Engin
eer. Any stonework that may be dis
placed would have a fall of at least 250
feet to the sidewalk and endanerer the
lives of pedestrians.
In Cairo the proportion of blind people
to the population is one to every twenty

$5633 20. . Â¦ Â¦.
Notwithstanding that'the Board of "Ed
ucation several months ago 'was fearful
that there would be a deficit in its funds
and laid off a number of mechanics at the
time. Auditor Baehr produced figures yes
terday to show that there is a surplus of
$3635 2C in the common school fund for
the flscal year 1902-03. which may be used
for any purpose the board sees fit.
SCHOOL BOARD
HAS A SURPLUS
The School Board received n-tlflcation
from the Board of Works that it had ap
pointed JamÂ«*s B. McSheehy to be Inspec
tor of school buildings at a salary of (100
per month. The board refused to con
firm the appointment and sent a letter to
the Board of Public Works to hold thÂ«
appointment In abeyance until the next
regular meeting of the School Board,
whrn the matter will be considered.
Woodward explained that W. B. Com
mary is at present acting as assistant in
spector of school buildings at a salary
ff $125 per month.
"Thero will be no use for two inspec
tors," said Woodward, "as tho force of
mechanics will *oon bÂ« reduced to twelve
and two inspectors are not required to
supervise such a small force."
J. J. Murphy, the engineer at the Hall
of Justice, who secured a writ of injunc
tion restraining the Board of Works from
removing him. was at his post yesterday.
Commissioners Maqson and Casey de
cided that it would be wise to allow Mur
phy to remain rather than to run the
risk of being In contempt of court. Ca
sey, however, expects to show conclusive
ly to the court that a majority of the.
board has a perfect right to remove tem
porary employes appointed for a period
of thirty days.
When thÂ« subject of bulldiny a heatin* plant
In the Noe Valley School was flr*t brought
up we were informed unofficially that the cost
would net exceed farxK). and with that under
standing were prepared to go on with the work.
The Board of labile Work* filed a set of plaiw
and specifications for the*, work, â¢ but' did not
submit a cost estimate for our consideration,
as It is required to do by law. We. waited for
this estimate and the next thin* we knew the
contract had been awarded without our sanc
tion as to thÂ» cost., Besides, th* plan for
which the contract was let Is not In favor with
the board, ax it involves thÂ« heatlnc of the
building by *team. We have photographs in
our possession showing that boiler explosions
have frequently been the result where steam
is used for heatlns and we certainly will not
upprove of Â«uch Â» plan. It looks as though
the ISnftni of Work* will be ot>ll(red to cancel
Ihls Rward and Invite new bids after It haÂ«
submitted a cost estimate to this board.
The Board of Public Works awarded a
contract on Friday last for the, installa
tion of a heating and ventilating plant In
the new Noe Valley School to R. Dalzell
Jr. for J5779, and now the Board of Edu
cation will refuse, to approve the award
because the price is far in excess of what
it was led to believe it would be.'
The matter came up before the School
Board yesterday and President "Woodward
was outspoken regarding the careless
methods employed by the- Board of Pub-

THE AGREEMENT
Harper's wife is said to be Involved, and
since the shooting both Dunlap and Har
per have endeavored to have the prosecu
tion dropped. District Attorney Alvarado
has refused, and threatened that unless
Dunlap took the stand he would proceed
with the evidence of the deputy sheriff.
The result was the ho'.dlng of Harper,
who Immediately gave bonds.
POINT RICHMOND, Aug. 1.â Despite
the fact that both the prosecuting witness
and the defendant were anxious ta settle
tho case, District Attorney Alvarado of
Contra Costa County refused to allow any
such proceeding, and J. J. Harper was
held to-day to answer before thÂ« Superior
Court for attempting to murder J. M.
Dunlap in this place last May.
The shooting: of Dunlap created a sin
ration at the time. Harprr and his wife
cam* to Point Richmond especially to see
Dunlap. and, as he asserted at the time,
to demand money from him. Dunlap ex
pected them, for he had with him 'a dep
uty sheriff. There was trouble between
Harper and Dunlap. and Harper shot
Dunlap, but not fatally.

MUST ANSWER
FOR SHOOTING
TAKES HIS GOOD
FORTUNE CALMLY
After both attorneys had said that they
were satisfied to submit the matter. As
sessor Dalton was questioped by the mem
bers of the board relative tc his assess
ment of the railway's property, and made
the following stuttinent:
"It is well enough for Mr. Chapman to
come in here and ask that the assessment
of the railway be raised from $2,300,000 to
over $10,000,000. but what, are you going to
raise it on? I have to take a list of the
property belonging to the railway aud
place a valuation upon each separate
piece. The railway turns in a list of all
Its property to me, without any values,
and then I make my own assessments.
In this case I placed as high a value upon
it as 1 thought-- It .would stand. In com:
parlaori with other railways and proper
ties, I think that it is a fair "valuation
ar.djl v,*5uld like to have it remain."
After this ttatement had been made th*
board went Into , a short , executive ses
slcn and upon, reconvening Chairman
Rowe united if there was any. motion be
fore the board, when Supervisor Mitchell
made the motion that the petition be de
nied. It was seconded and unanimously
carried. .
"iMr. Chairman. I have given ud all
hope of having a chance to say the last
word in this arzument. My friend on
the other slde.no sooner stops and J be
gin, than he is at it again."
"You can't have the lust word in this
argument;. 1 open and close it myself."
interjected Chapman. i ,
All of the morning and most of 'the af
ternoon was consumed in thrashing the
matter out brfore the board, but all
finally simmered down to the proposition
that there was really nothing before, t><
board to act noon, more than the mere
fact of the petition' Itself. Nothing of a
positive nature was elicited from any of
tho witnesses called and their testimony
was ruled out an irrelevant^ and not con
clusive of elucidating the point at issue.
As a parting shot Chapman produced
tho thirty-fifth edition of Poor's manual
of railroads, published in New York city.
Under the head of the Oakland Transit
Consolidated it gave the purported
monthly earnings of the company for the
preceding twelve months, the gross re
ceipts aggregating $830,2*2 <6, while the
net income was said to be $3>!,S73 67. In
this financial statement for 1802 the capi
tal stock was placed at SC.9OO.00O and the
funded debt at $3,015,000, making the total
value of the stock and bonds of the com
pany $9,915,000. i
Upon this showing Chapman marie his
final stand. He argued that this was suf
ficient to base an inquiry upon.
It was pointed out by Chairman Rowe
that for advertising purposes, figures far
In excess of the real value.; of things were
often published to the world, "and we all
know." he tsald, "who have had anything
to do with the floating of companies that
there is nothing unusual in such a state
ment having been issued or one, for that
matter, of twice that amount, besides
which you have not shown that this \*
a. statement made by the company."
DALTON DEFENDS FIGURES.
Â¦The petitioners were represented by At
torney M. C. Chapman, whose knowledge
of the value. of the railway's property
was gained from pamphlets and yearly
reports, the statements in which, how
ever. It was not shown had come from
any official of the railway company. He
tailed upon W. H. Knight. ex-Public Ad
ministrator, who had aided in the publi
cation of a pamphlet on the value of the
railway; L,. G. Burpee of the First Na
tional Bank and Thomas Prattler of the
Union National Bank, and read a private
letter purporting to have been written by
the secretary of the corporation, but to
whom he was pledged not to tell. In this
letter It was stated that the va'.ue of the
railway's property^ was 39.913,000.
The questioning of the bankers was as
to tho value of the railway steak, but
their only way cf knowing what the value
of the stock was proved to come from
stock reports, and not from their personal
knowledge of the affairs of the corpora
tion. They knew of no sales of stock by
which the value could be fixed. Chapman
was forced to admit that the line of evi
dence he was presenting was not such as
would be entertained in a court of law,
but argued that these tigures were suf
ficient for the beard to base an Inquiry
upon.
The proceedings were not altogether of
a serious character. Attorney Chapman,
with his adversary. Harmon Bell, not be
ing under the restraint of a court, in
dulged in a go-as-you-p!ase conduct of
the matter with little regard to rules.
There were frequent sharp exchanges a.n1
a squabble as to who Fhould have the
last. word. In (-this connection, at ona
stage of the proceedings. Bell said:
NOTHING BEFORE BOARD.
The citizens have lost their fight to have
the assessment of the Oakland Transit
Consolidated raised from $2,300,000 to $10.,.
500.C00, or any "reasonable" sum. The
county Board of Equalization decided to
day that the assessment was a fair valu
ation of the property and unanimously
agreed to deny the petition asking for a
change ot the Assessor's figures. While,,
numerous purported facts and figures
were presented to the board with a view
toward proving that the railway property
was of far greater value than that placed
upon it by the Ascessor. the character of
the evidence introduced to prove it was
of such a nature that the board decided
it could not take cognizance of it, and in
the absence of any conclusive proof the
case failed

The demand among retailers for choice fruits
for the Sunday trade was active and there was
a fair inquiry for shipment on the Portland
steamer. The market, however, presented a
top-heavy appearance, and as some of the river
boats were late again there was a heavy sur
plus of Peaches and other fruits unsold at the
end of the day. The belated boats brought
heavy cargoes and nWt of Friday's late ar
rivals were still on hand. The top quotation
for Peaches in small boxes was obtained only
foi*cholce shipping f-tock. 35c being about the
top for the common run. The canners were
rather Indifferent buyers of Peaches and Plums,
being very busy with Uartlett Pears. ApricotJ
in bulk were offering freely and the cannera
reduced their bids for common offerings. Choice
lot?, however, continued to sell readily at the
maximum quotation.â Choice Plums In crates
suitable for shipping and small packages of
Apricots were in somewhat light supply anil
firm,, but offher fruits in small boxes and crates
were in ample supply and easy. Flg3 con
tinued to bring high prices, receipts being light.
Watermelons were active at previous prices
and Nutmeg Melons and Cantaloupes were
steady despite the heavy receipts. Berries
bhowed but ellRht Relation and attractive lots
lound ready sale.
There v.-ora no new features In the market
for Citrus and Tropical truits and prices were

THE CENTER OF THE WORLD.
"Where is the center of the world?"
This Is the question Jupiter was asked as
he sat In his golden hall. Of course the mighty
ruler of the earth and sky was too wise to be
puzzled by so*, simple a question, but he was
too busy to answer it at once. So he said:
\ ______
"Come again in one year from to-day and I
will ehow you the very place."
Then Jupiter took two swift eagles which
couM fly faster than the storm wind and
trained them till the .peed of the one was the
bame as that of the other.
At the end of the year he said to his ser-
vant?:
"Take this eagle to the eastern rim of the
earth, where the sun rises out of the sea. and
carry his fellow to the far west, where tho
ocean is lost In darkness and nothing lies be-
yond. Then when I give you the sign loosen
both at the same moment."
The servants did as they were bidden and
carri*Hl the eagles to the outermost edges ot the
world.
Then Jupiter Happed his hands. Th* light-
ning flashed, the thunder rolled and the two
birds were sft free-
One of them flew straight back towards the
West and the other flew straight back towards
the East; and no arrow ever sped faster from
the bow than did the_e two birds from the
hunts of those who had held them.
On and on they went like phooting stars,
rushing to meet each other, and Jupiter and
aK his mighty company eat amid the clouda
and watched their flight.
Nearer, and nearer they came, but they
swerved not to the right nor to the left.
Nearer and nearer, and then with a crash
like the meeting of two ships at sea the eagles
came together in mid air and fell dead to the |
ground. â¢
â¢â¢Who asked where is thÂ» center of the
world?" said Jupiter. "The spot where the
eagles lie, that is the center of the world."
They had fallen upon the slope of a beautiful
hill, which is now called
PARNASSUK HEIGHTS. â¢
"If that Is the center of the world." said
young Apollo, "then I will make my home
there, and I will build a house In that place
so that my light may be seen In all lands."
â¢ Visitors to Parnassus Heights are
invited to Inspect the home of Apollo,
corner of H street and Seventh ave-
nue, which Baldwin & Howell I have
desecrated by converting it into a real
estate office.

B3 sary to cover long: distances over the broad steppes, it is most natural O
S that the -wedding procession should take the form of a "promenade en S

on Part of the Supervisors
"Was Fatal. -
The Supreme Court has decided that the
omission on the part of the Board of Su
pervisors to pass a resolution or inten
tion before proceeding to order certain
street work done waR fatal.
The case decided was brought by the
City Street Improvement Company to col
lect a pro rata' from" LucleC. Redlng^on
and William. Babcock for work done in
front of their properties. â¢
The judgment of ' the lower court was

Captain > Bolles sent 'for the offending
pilot and read him a brief but straight
forward lecture on/the Â«tules of naviga
tion. l:~-r^,\:.y. .. ' . v:r â¢ -fj
Frankly, the action of the master of the
Tlburon' can : only be attributed to pure cus
sedness, without regard to the lives of his own
passengers or those on the "other boat.
becausc he could have no otherâ of crossing her
bows and. com pell tngr the Sausallto to atop.
When he crossed her . bows there was not to
exceed fifty feet between the two boats. Hart
the signals from the pilot "house failed to work
or the engineer been. unable to shut down his
engine, a disastrous collision would have oc
curred. *Â¦: . Â«-. Â¦â¢â¢Â¦; \

sented in American waters only by small
cruisers and gunboats, conveying no Idea
of the strength of the empire's navy, but
he is still more anxious that Prince Henry
ghall leave the navy this fall.

question, in the sense that the columns
of any and every newspaper, review and
magazine are apparently free to any one
who cares to contribute his personal
view to the stock of Information, or mis

The Duke of Wellington has brought for
ward an array of statistics to prove that
the classes from which Tommy Atkins
is in the main recruited are not what
they were in the time of the Iron Duke,
in whose eyes a weakling was an abom
ination, let his moral character be never
so impeccable and his education and at
tainments of the highest.
The present Duke's contention has
given rise to much discussion. One writer
denies flatly that Englishmen, as a race,
are decreasing either in stature or phy
sique, and points triumphantly to the mul
titude of tall girls one sees in the ball
room, an argument which is rather be
side the question, as Amazonian regi
ments are not projected.
Another writer poohpoohs the ducal
Jeremiah by saying that the modern Eng
lishman cannot begin to get into the suit
of armor worn by his crusading progen
itors, while a third takes another tack
by exclaiming: "What if we are more di
minutive than we used to be? We dare
assert that a regiment of costermongcrs
unarmed would 'overcome a weaponless
regiment of Pomeranian" grenadiers."
Meanwhile another .note of alarm is
struck by Dr. Ernest W. White, professor
of psychological medicine at King's Col
lege, who in his presidential address to
the Medical Psychological Association
said that facts point to an accumulation
of the chronic insane and that the num
ber of cases of melancholia had vastly in
creased, frequently resulting In chronic
insanity. During the last few years Dr.
White had been struck by the large num
ber of cases of evolutionary mental
breakdowns occurring in patients of the
upper and middle classes from 13 to 20
years of age. \ This was the result of the
strain of 'education and the worries of
life upon brains unequal to the stress un
der which Londoners lived.

The Rev. Joseph Twltchell. Mark
Twain's friend, was called upon at short
notice to officiate at the funeral services
of a man who lived in Glastonbury, a
suburb of Hartford. Barely reaching the
church in time for the service, he could
only learn that the name of tho deceased
was the same as that of a person with
whom he had been acquainted some years
ago. In his eulogy he told a surprised
congregation of the virtues, thÂ© fatherly
tenderness and the felicities of thÂ© mar
ried life of his lamented friend.
After the service was over, Mr. Twltch

Plays and the Players.
The Herald's Paris edition publishes the
following from its correspondent: Amer
icans are to have another opportunity of
seeing the great Italian actor. Tommaso
Salvini, who will sail for the United
States early in the spring next year to
make a tour unq>r the management of
George C. Tyler of New York. Signer
Salvini will appear in "King Lear."
"Othello," "Ingomar" and "The Civil
Death," and in the first three of these
plays Miss Eleanor Robson will be the
Cordelia, Desdemona" and Parthenia, re
spectively. This combination of the
leonine Salvini and the young American
star Is one from which Mr. Tyler expects
great things. The engagement will run
through April and May nex.t. and pro
vides for twenty-five or thirty perform
ances, at the manager's option. Two
weeks will be given to New York, where
Salvini will appear four nights each week.
Miss Robson playing in her classical rep
ertoire on the other two nights of the
theatrical week. With the exception of
Salviiil, who will, of course, play in Ital
ian, 'all the company will be English
speaking. For Miss Robson' s regular sea
son, which will open in October, Mr. Ty
ler has obtained two attractive novelties.
One is the dramatization by the author
himself of Israel ZangwIH'u story, "Mere
ly Mary Ann." "Merely Mary Ann" will
be followed by the production of either
"La Valliere," by M. Henri BataIHe, the
adapter of Tolstoi's "Resurrection." or
"Agatha," an original play by Mrs.
Humphry Ward and Louis N. Parker.
"Agatha" presents another phase of the
question treated in 'Mrs. Ward's novel.
"Lady Rose's Daughter."
Louis James and , Frederick /Warde,
Richard Mansfield and James K. Hackett,
all announce for production next season
plays based on the life of Alexander the
Great, but the only, play of this name
about which any definite information
and Lackaye's left eyebrow lifted again,
"It is well to have a good standard."
"I saw," he resumed, after a moment's
pause, "a certain Shylock a short time
ago. I won't tell who "
"I won't ask," I said, "I know."
"I had said to myself that here would
bo .either a^marvelous mimicry of * his
ideal Shylock, or an outrageously modern
one," Lackaye pursued. "But It was nei
ther. It simply wobbled. The actor was
in a state ,of semi-hysteria from the un
favorable criticisms, got rattled, simply
knocked out. Didn't know what he, the
public, the poet, the critics or any one
else wanted. He didn't even please him
self."
'.'It is only in pleasing oneself that the
new things get done," I venture, "that
Shaws, Wildes and Maeterlincks happen."
"Miller is going to do 'The Devil's Dis
ciple* here, I see. I'd like to see it," thÂ©
actor avowed. "And I should like tre
mendously to see 'You Never Can Tell.'
Fancy Shaw making his hero a dentist!
Shaw and Wilde both 6ee their world
through prisms."
"We all have our prismsâ of a sort."
the actor continued. "Roserifeld here in
America, by the way, preceded Wilde in
his peculiar atmosphere and in his inver
sion of old sawsâ I remember one of
them: 'To the pure all things are im
proper.' "
Then as time was rapidly going I asked
Mr. Lackaye where he stood on the ques
tion of the National Theater. He told me
then of his devoted adherence to the plan
and of what he hoped It would mean to
dramatic art In America.
"If it means anything at all, thÂ© Na
tional Theater, it means brick up the box
office," he said. "Play a play because it
should be played, because 'it Is good, and
not because it, pays. Herr Conried at a
late meeting of those Interested In the
movement advocated the wholesale bring
ing over of foreign plays. Gus Thomas
opposed him In favor of the American
drama. I advocated the good play from
anywhere."
He then told me of much practical work
that has been already done In furtherance
of the movement, and I said that at least
a National Theater should have a whole
some effect on the diction of the day.
"We don't want quite the Comedie
Francalse sort of thing though," the
actor said; "it would please a college pro
fessor dreadfully, but I don't like to hear
the wheels go round quite so plalntly.
Stillâ Well, ' for example, our Mme. Yin-
"I know exactly how he feels," Mr.
LackayÂ© went on. "for the moment I get
with a newspaper person my quills In
stinctively go out and I begin to wonder
â¢Does the fellow think I want to "con"
him?* Then I begin to 'guy.' Then the
manager perhaps says, 'You mustn't guy
the press.' You know people talk about
newspaper folk as if they were a race
apart, just as they talk about actors.
You can Imagine that restaurant keeper
there, for instance". If an actor made a
row here, saying that he would never let
any more actors into his house?â for the
sins of the soubrette shall descend upon
the tragedian "and so on! You never hear
mine host say that he won't allow any
more doctors In his place, thÂ«ueh win
dows do occasionally break under the
medical fist. But actors and newspaper
men don't change their spots when they
choose to act and write. There are as
many different kinds of newspaper men
as there are men. And certainly they
don't lost their sense of humor when they
enter the craft. Not generally, that is,"
he added after a pause. Then .he got
up, and pacing cheerfully round his cor
ner told tho following with much enjoy
ment: "There was a fellow who did dra
matic criticism forâ above everythingâ
the Police Gazette. Got big money for it,
too. One morning after a first night I
met him on the street. He had a very
sardonic expression, and he asked, as if
he'd roasted me his best: 'See w.hat I put
about-you in the paper^thls morning?' I
said: 'No. I shaved myself to-day!' Oh,
but he was raging! I thought he'd take
it as a joke. But he left word at the
officeâ I got it from a sporting reporter
of the Gazette at a prize tieht months
afterwardâ 'Whenever that fellow shows
his head, bit It!'"
"You were the first Svengali, weren't
you, Mr. Lackaye?" I queried when I
had done laughing at my confrere of the
Gazette.
"The first," he replied, 'tthough they
told me that my nose was too small s to
attempt it," he added, whimsically. "Can
you beat that?" .
The artist here testified to the lasting
impression the weird impersonation had
made upon him, I saying that Mr. Lack
aye's rabbi in "The Children of the Ghet
to" was to me his master work. /
"I'm glad you liked that," the . actor
said, impulsively, to the rabbi's cham
pion. " "I liked it myself better than any
other part that I have played."
More talk of Svencall. and then his
ard In Tribly* hereâ I Bhould have enjoyed
myself better if she hadn't said 'Vollay
ung dapachay' ' when she handed me a
dispatch. And it would have rid me of
the unpleasing necessity of s asking the
manager for her to give it us in English,
and of hearing her hurt reply: 'I speak
French as well as any one not born to
thÂ© business!* Can you beat that?"
truthful and expressive gesture?"
"Exactly," the actor confirmed. "The
bigger player has a bigger arc of physical
expression, that is all. Of course, one
'wrastles' with the psychology of a part
behind one's own door, but all of the
'wrastling* comes out only as more or
less truthful gesture. When I find a critic
digging up this and that abstruse psycho
logical theory concerning a part, I always
suspect he has been supping with the
actorâ who has been explaining what he
meant!"
"But all this is not why the critic can't
write plays ?" \
"If one knew that one would know how
to write a play," Mr. Lackaye laughed.
"Why the critics can'tâ don'tâ write criti
cism, is a much more vital question. If
the giants of the press only knew their
power, I think they would be more care
ful. This proposition of tho new criti
cismâin which one ruins a career to get
a laugh, wrecks a reputation to point a
period, is doubtless sport to the critic. It
is not so pleasant to the actor, whose
livelihood and Ideals are at stake."
"Do you think that kind of thing com
mon?"
"There is not a one-night stand from
here to New York that has not felt the
effect of it," the critics' critic maintained.
" 'Star' journalism is, of course, respon
sible, the signed articles. When the
critique might have been done by the city
editor no one cared to do that sort of
thing. But the man now tries to give
you himself, not the play, and the public
sayE: 'Did you see what So-and-So has
to sayr Or again: 'So-and-So must be a
good criticâ he roasts everything!' "
Then w:th his characteristic "Can you
beat that?" Mr. Lackaye instanced the
case of a prominent critic who had never
strayed from his own fireside, making
a rechauffe of some New York thunder
with local allusions, and with some^"cold
potatoes" and "cheese crusts" of his
own. Afterward he testified handsomely
to the worth of critics like William Win
ter, James Hunekerâ who is a delight to
read"â Mr. Towse, and others such.
Naturally then the talk turned on the
connection between newspaper men and
actors--.
"I find," Mr. Lackaye laughed, lifting
that quizzical left eyebrow of his, "that
nine times out of ten the newspaper man
who knows you is twice as severe when
it comes to criticism. It's the human
thing. He feels friendly to you, yet wants
to be honest, and he bends over back
ward in trying to be straight!"
"creator" asked me if I remembered Ig
nacio Martinettl. the original Zou-zou.
I. of course, did. .
" 'Nash* was a great fellow," Mr. Lack
aye began, chuckling. "He had been on
the stage ever since he was 5 years oldâ
about -thirty-five yearsâ and we used to
treat him as if ho were about 3000 years
old. We'd ask him on the train, 'Papa,
can we have this, that and the other?'
before tho waiters. He didn't like it. But
when we were out here a fellow named
Nanklvell camo to sketch and interview
me. I introduced 'Nash' to him as the
'dean' of the company, told of the tender
ness and regard with which the company
all treated the poor old gentleman. And,
by George, Nankivell took it all In. Next
day Ihere came out a picture of 'Nash*
all G strings here," and the actor plucked
unconvincingly at his coming double chin,
"and with feeble old limbs and a thou
sand wrinkles, and an account under it of
the fine old veteran of the 'Trilby' com
pany. I had to send him a present for
that."
"Who?" I queried. - ,
"Oh, 'Nash,'" Mr. Lackaye bubbled.
"And that wasn't the only time that he
got it in San Francisco. One day I was
with him in the red room at the Bohe
mian Club, strumming on the piano. Araa
deo Joullin, whd'm I knew, came in. I
spoke to him of 'Nash,' and he said he
had seen him twenty-six years ago some,
where or other! "You'd better tell him
that,' I said, 'he loves to talk of the old
days.' They were Alphonslng and Gaston
lng all over the place the next moment,
and then Joullin said: 'I waa just telling
Lackaye that I had seen you twenty-six
years ago atâ ' 'Nash' just looked at me
then, white with rage, and bolted out into
the street without his hat."
"If I hadn't seen you on the stage I
should be tempted to ask if you ever
found time for your art," I laughed. .
"A little," the actor owned. "Now, I
thinkâ talking of art, and the French
spell it with a big 'A'â that it Is better
for art to be more familiar with it. There
is a tremendous lot of affectation in art
talk. Sometimes some one will say to
me: 'What do you do when there is
something you know to be inartistic "that
will please the public, that it is possible
to introduce into your: part?' 'I amuse
myself,' I reply. 'You mean that you live
up to yonr_ideals?*. No, Â¦ more sincerely,
I say I amuse myself. At least some one
will be. pleased. . It's, taking chances, try
ine pleasinc an audience. Of 'Â¦. course."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 2, 1903.
WITH THE PLAYERS
AND THE
MUSIC
FOLK
THE first gun of the coming musi
cal season has sounded, and a very
big gun it is. Perhaps nothing
more musically fortunate than the
eng^ement of Herr Fritz Scheel
to lead a series of symphony concert*
here could have been locally hoped for.
Ilerr Scheel is too well known here to
need any'advertisement in these columns.
His auspicious Introduction to us at the
Midwinter Fair, his several series of
symphony concerts In San Francisco, are
all matters of the city's most prized his
tory. The conductor, since hl3 departure
from here, has been occupied in making
symphony history for Philadelphia. After
his firstâ or second season there, was It?â
the symphony society of the Quaker City
faced a deficit of J70.0CO for the season,
but its directors had such eminent faith
in their conductor's genius that they
moved all heaven and Philadelphia to put
the organization on its feet again. SInca
then the fame of Philadelphia's symphony
society has gone abroad even unto
Gotham, and is now competing with that
of Boston itself. The Beethoven cycle,
with which Herr Scheel closed his lasl
season, and whereat all of the nine sym
phonies were performed. Is unique in
American history, and onÂ© of the most
famous of contemporary achievements.
The conductor, alas: will not have that
famous Philadelphia orchestra with him.
â¢but from Its work last season we can hope
for excellent things from our own local
material. It would be' the part of wis
dom, if such did not conflict with the
rather comic opera conditions existent In

must mean at least "Eln Heldenleben."

East.
The conductor started yesterday for San
Francisco, and his first concert will be
(D. V.) on the 14th of August, at the
Grand Opera-bouse. Meantime there is
everything to bÂ© done. Those desiring
membership in â¢ the San Francisco Sym
phony Society should send in immediate
application to Mr. Shafter Howard, at
room 91, Crocker building. The privileges
of membership are many, not least the
obtaining of season tickets for the con
certs at two-third of the single aeat ad
mission price. The choice seats of course
is among the many advantages, and a
warm consciousness of doing the abso
lutely best thing that can be done for
good music in San Francisco should not
be counted least. And now, to work!
seems to be forthcoming is that in which
Warde and James are to appear. Tho
tour for the play has been entirely booked
and their managers Wagenhals and
Kemper. have a scenic production, which
is to be on a'very elaborate scale well

Amused-Â»-Mr. Lcckaye's sense of" humor
may be basked enâ and sympathetic, the

A moment later and he was" seated at
the. small, white-clothed table that held
the renter ct the room. I/placed myse'f
opposite. Two minutes later he was
drawing with deft thumb-nail a plan of
the City Hall on the shining linen la
Iront of him. We had reached, thÂ© City
Hall by *vay of Central Park, New York,
near by where Mr. Lackaye, when ho is
at home, lives. He had passed over to
me before" some photographs of. . the
plump, dimpled' Lackaye junior, eighteen
months old. "who spends fijom 7 Â«_â¢ m. to

elevation of the drama" and "so'ch like
trifles:" His papa's opinion, by the w.ay,
M-enicd pardonably similar. We got to
talk of Golden^ Gate Par4c then, and
thence to ex-Mayor Pfrelan's princely no
tion.of extending the. "panhandle" to the
City Hall. Then the penny .wisdom that
permitted cur local Parthenon to be bur
ied in a .Market-street back yard, to be
Br-en onlf slot fashion from our principal
thoroughfare. .was touched on,- Mr. Lack
aye finally commenting critically upon
the architecture itself. With the salt and
pepper castorsâ for thÂ© table was. "set"â
the actor erected a new city hall, shorn
of its right and. left "wings, an alteration
that he. insisted" would better the propor
tTons of the building and Its lighting fa
cilities "and make possible something ap
proaching ja* dignified view of the place,
though not from Market street.
"But we won't talk architecture?" I
suggested when, truth to tell, the archi
tectural mysteries were getting over
much for me. "May we talk about your
starring Â°tour to eotoe? You are to star
in ; The Pit,' Norris* story â¢ I understand.
Who has dramatized It?"
.The architect* rather reluctantly de
molished' his left wing (the pepper) and
replied: "Oh, Charming' Pollock, a Wash

I believe it is going to be very good.
Still, forecasting a play's future Is an
admirably uncertain sort ot prophecy."
"But with a dramatic critic. Mr. Lack

"Bu.t seriously, now, why is it, do you
think, that so Tew of US writÂ© good
plays?"
"I>on't know, but you don't." laughed
the actor. I find him delidously frank,
utterly tearless. "It's rather astonishing,
that fact, l6n<t It? " he went on, thought
fuHy smoothing out thÂ© ground plan of
his City Hall with a plump forefinger.

ECHOES FROM THE LODGE ROOM

47The older of the horsemen said:
"One of my best horses was sent out to
Kansas to pass the rest of his days quiet
ly on a farm; the farmer had a barn
stored with corn, which took fire one cold
afternoon, and as the heat was so Intense
It managed to pop the corn very quickly,
which, with the strong wind blowing at
the time, caused the corn to fly about In
all directions. The old mare stood watch
ing this for a few minutes, thought It was
snow, and then lay down and froxe to
death."â New York Time*.
