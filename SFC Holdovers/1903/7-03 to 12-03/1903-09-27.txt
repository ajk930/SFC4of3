Industry of getting out a daily morning
newspaper were a physical, rather than a
mental undertaking. Their cordiality was
as great as Mr. Carson's, indeed seemed
to be imitative of his. The members- of
the council soon dispersed, each receiv
ing what to Howard. was a bewildering
multiplicity of Instructions and cautions,
having to do. with the necessity of some
one in some part of the world being told
to "hustle."
When the last of them was on his way
to prod some one to hustle Mr. . Carson
swept a confusion of proof slips, photo
graphs, exchanges, copy, and reference
books from off the chair least incum
bered. and motioned Howard to be seated,
then seated himself on a cleared corner
of a table. "Now, Mr. Paxton," the man
aging editor said,, "you'll have nothing
to do with this' end of the shop. We'll
find you a quiet desk, up a flight or down
a flight, where you'll be by yourself, or
at the worst, with some special writer,
like yourself." -
"Thank you," Howard replied, smiling.
"I don't' think I could do very much work
out there," motioning to the' rooms he had
passed through.
"Oh, that's the boiler shop! The kind
of work we do out there would come to a
standstill if. .we kept things quiet The
theory Is, that nothing here must be al
lowed to fall into a rut, and if men are
allowed to work under normal conditions
their work becomes normal. | We .want ab

Daisy saw the hand her friend extended,
but Ignored It, bowed coldly, and passed
on to her car. She had been piqued by
the attention Worthington had paid to
Grace; and, besides that cause for her
coldness, a sudden . caprice made her
think of Grace as an unfashionable Whit.;

city was already upon him, and he felt a
zeal, an earnestness, he had never before

"The case Is like this, Grace," said
Howard. "Mr. Worthington showedâ that

"It was very manly," said Grace, with

Then she laughed and said: "Really.' Mr.

"This -brings us nicely around to the

It doesn't frighten me. I stick to busi

some Importance, such as our family's
end of this new iron deal. This, ladles
and gentlemen, brings me to White River
and the end of tny story."
When Worthington concluded Howard
arose and said "Gentlemen of the Jury,
have you agreed upon the verdict?"
"We have," solemnly answered Grace.
"We find the defendant is not guilty."
TVorthington rose. I thank the Jury.
The jury's brother tells me that the
Jury plays the spinet. May I have
proof?"
Grace went to the piano and played.
In a little time they were all singing,
with enthusiasm and Ingenious device,
operatic selections requiring anywhere
from two to fifty voices. Grace at
times supplying the entire female chorus,
end the two men all the male voices of
a crand opera.
In the next few months Mr. Worth

several times. On each visit he carried
with him the score and book of a new
opera to add to the repertoire of tho

treacherous fellows. He not only told me
that you eald I was a captain, but basely
made me promise not to tell that he told.
That's -why I shan't say a word about It."
Grace made such a face at her brother
that both the men laughed. "AH men,"
â¢he declared eeverely, "are Idle gossips;
brothers most so. If women gossiped
half as much as men do men would make
m. law to behead us."
THE next evening when Howard
came home Grace, looking out fcr
him, caw with her brother a young
m&n of about bis age. but slighter,
taller and more buoyant physically,
and they were talking together merrily,

before in his life! When he had accepted
a third portion of tea, preserves and bis
cuits (until then he knew "biscuits" only
as little disks of dusty crumbs) he turned
to Grace and 'said: "You are surprised
to see a captain of .Industry eat with the
appetite of a private of Industry."

brother, and said freezlngly: "If my
brother has been telling you silly stories
he's the meanest creature alive."
chapters of this narrative, Mr. Worth
ington learned, with considerable Inter
est, that his musical companions were
to rnlerrate to New York.
Howard received two offers from New
York papers. One came in a friendly let
ter written by the managing editor of the
New York Guardian.. Jt. offered him a
salary of sixty dollars a week." to '"do for
us the .kind and amount of work you
are now doing: for __lhp Advocate."
- Howard liked the tone of the letter,
and was considering an immediate fa
vcrablc reply, when he received this
telegram: "Come on at once. One hun
dred a week. Or more at space rates.
Do what you want, where you want.
Rush reply. Managing editor. Morning
Chronicle."
This was Howard's first encounter
with live journalism, and he was at a
loss to decide- how* to answer; while he
â¢wan debating in his mind a second de
spatch came from the Chronicle which
read; "Error in former wire. Our offer
is a guarantee of one hundred and fifty
a week. Will feature you big. Hustle
an answer by wire. Mall your photo
gÂ£aph. If you have any matter ready,
wire it at once. Can we announce' some
thingby you next Sunday?"
As an anodyne to the electrical lever
Howard wired that he would send his
decision the next day. But he did not
know the Chronicle â yet! In an hour
this message was delivered to him:
'"Glad you are coming. Don't forget

"And how about some one else?" he
asked, his ' slowly aroused enthusiasm
beginning to show. "Who will 'go to the
School of Design? not to speak of any
one else buying nice clothes?*;
"The School of Design!" Grace re
peated In an ecstacy. "Florence Hart
ley writes me that lots of women are
going In for interior decoration. I
Jnst know that I can do good work in
that, if I can take the course. It's a
dream come true. Howard."
"How about this Guardian offer?" How
ard suggested. Â¦ if '
"Pooh!" cried Grace. "Only $60 a week!
A hundred and fifty from the great
Chronicle!"
"The great Chronicle, yes, but not great
along my line of -work."
"You can reform 'em, then," she said
confidently.
Grace, who had never been further
from home than a doctor's gig ride, was
in a storm of joyful excitement. Most she
rejoiced In the 'promised opportunity .to
better pursue her studies in the art' of ap
plied design. She had a friend, Miss Flor
ence Hartley; In the New York School of
Design, and since Miss Hartley's visit" to
relatives in White River, when Grace had
met her, they had been enthusiastic cor
respondents . on the subject- of their com
mon ' studies and ambitions.
So, buoyant and confident, she went
Â¦with her brother to the new, bustling sta
tion where they were to take the evening
train to New York. Something unusual
appeared to have drawn *a gay and ani
mated ' crowd. Howard soon ; learned.
"Why, Grace," he said, "the Buntons are
going to New York, - too." "How Jolly!"
cried Grace. "Won't it be nice to travel
with old friends!" â¢ \ â¢â¢

of what was possibly expected of him.
"we don't Include your work in any of
the classes I've mentioned. You are to
start a new department. We like the
stuff you mailed to us and will feature
It big for the Sunday Magazine. By the
'way, 'would you like to look over the
proofs of your matter?"
Howard said that he would, and a mes
senger was sent for "a proof of the Pax
ton page." Howard wondered at the word
"page," as he had sent not more than a
column and a half of copy. But his
amazement grew when the proof was
Jjrought to him. It was a page. Indeed,
with a head that ran Quite across it, and
Included a dozen or more illustrations
and a big, bold picture of himself. He
read the matter, his cheeks growing red
der as he saw each of his paragraphs
pictured with gross misshapen carica
tures. At one of these he paused Indig
nantly. He â¢ had written some verses,
dainty and tender, suggested by his sis
ter's enthusiasm over her future as a de
signer. Playing upon the word, he had
fancied a young, sweet-minded woman
going to the big city, her imagination
filled with "designs," but all that came of
them, try as she would, was that she ever
"designed" the same old home â an honest
lover's heart â and was Its sole happy oc
cupant! The illustration for this was a
scantily dressed woman on a stage ogling
a stage box filled with men reciprocating
her glances.
. "I should like," Howard said to Mr.
Carson, "to make a couple of sugges
tions."
"As many as you like." '
"This picture of meâ it's soâ soâ big
and "
"And you're so modest," laughed Mr.
Carson, good-naturedly. "As good-looking
a chap as you mustn't be afraid of seeing
his own picture. Walt until you aee the
big posters. They're being put up around
town to-night."
"Of me?" asked -Howard, embarrassed.
"No. That's what surprised the fellow

have you now. But before the night end

The theaters were closed and most eS
their patrons had been swept away by
the receding Wde which set strongly ta
all directions away from, that neighbor
hood, yet not so strongly but that It left
some froth, some dregs of humanity.
Now another tide set toward tho dis
trict: a smaller current which settled,
for the moment In restless pools, ona of
which was a quiet little restaurant of
some pretensions to exduslvenesa. It
was for the "late men." hard workers
whose supper there at one, two, or
three o'clock in the morning correspond
ed to the early evening dinners of mÂ«i
who workâ or playâ by daylight. It waa
there Turnbull took his charge for sup
per. They sat at a table a little with
drawn from the others by a slight Ir
regularity In the room, but which
commanded a view of tho other tables.
Turnbull Identified many of those who
entered as men holding Important posi
tions on morning papers, or players, or
musicians, of prominence In their pro
fessions. The piece had a quiet, club
like atmosphere, and his host told How
ard that the men he saw were to bÂ«
found there at their accustomed - seats,
and regular hours, night after night.
Howard, with his "villager" appettt*
sharpened by excitement, ordered a
hearty meal: but Turnbull ordered only
one simple dish which he did not touch
when it was served.
"Oh, pardon me for not asking you
before! Do you drink?" Turnbull said
after a silence, during which his clench
ed hands had been held by his side with
an effort, as It he were trying to con
trol some mastering passion.
Howard had been devoting boyish at
tention to his supper, and had not â¢*-
Howard noticed that Carson scowled,
but he wrote an order for the amount
Turnbull named and gave it to him.
The two young men went Into several
theaters. Turnbull taking much interest
In Howard's delight in the xnarvnloua
show of costumes, scenery, lights, but no
Interest whatever In those things. Ha
waa politely patient In giving Howard In
formation about all they saw and heard,
yet all the time had a manner of con
trolling some strong nervous Impulse.
"I'm boring you to death." Howard said,
noticing this manner In his companion.
"I don't suppose you New Yorkers can
have any notion of the fairyland all thla
is to a strangerâ especially to a villager
who. for the first time !n his life, is see-
Ing some of the wonders that he's read
and dreamed of so much. I'm rather a
slow-blooded chap, I've always thought;
but I guess you'd be amazed If you could
know how near I am at this minute to
performing a war dance, with appropriate
shouts, as an expression of my state of,
mind."
"You needn't explain your stats of
mind to me," his companion said, smil
ing, "for I'm not a New Yorker, and not
many years ago had my first night In
New York, but. being of another tem
perament. I didn't stop at the thought of
a devil's dance to express my feelioxs; I
danced."
"You don't look It," Howard laughed.
" "TurnbuII."- Interrupted the editor,
"Paxton's going uptown, and I was
thinking who I could get to pilot him
around â you are not working to-night?"
"I am not,** Turnbull replied. He was
In evening dress. "I am at Mr. Pax
ton's service."
<r We must not let him get lost or bÂ«
lonely on his first night In town. Tou'll
be In time to see an act at one or two*
theaters. I'll try to Join you by the time
you are at supper." Carson said.
Paying no attention to this remark,
Turnbull said: "I want some money."
"How much?" Carson asked, taking
an order book from a drawer, "Twenty
flver'
"One hundred." responded Turnbull.
The man rose and gravely acknowl
edged an Introduction to Howard. "Toa

ing slightly. "They are too dainty. I've
Just run through your proofs. The verses
you called 'Designs' are especially goodâ
a dainty, tender touch, there. For
heaven's sake. Carson, kill that hideous
drawing in those verses."
"It's killed already," said Carson. "But.
Turnbull, you must not tell Paxton that
his work's too good for us. He'll strlka
for more pay!"
Turnbull, not noticing Carson, continued
to talk of the newcomer's work.
Howard bad never seen a man so
handsome, almost beautiful. Up was tall
and alight of figure, with darkly pale skin,
deep, large calm eyes, rather thin lips
that did not look ungenerous, however,
and a chin that was set and molded like
that the sculstor cave to the Venus of
llllo.
The chief smiled at b!s picture of the
managing editor, and all the heads of
departments laughed heartily. Carson
himself smiled as If. though the Joke waa
on him. It was Irresistible, nevertheless.
"Now you are to go right ahead, doing
your own work in your own way. and
according to your contract; and don't let
Carson or any one else Interfere. If you
have any trouble, or any one bothers you.
come straight to me and I'll set things
right â if I have any influence on this pa

the others laughed. "Dine with ma to
morrow." the chief added bluffly.
Howard thanked him and explained that
he had promised the next evening to his
sister. "Quite right," the chief said.
"But soon, soon."
When Howard returned to his office
with Mr. Carson a man was sitting there,

His work was hard, but he liked to work
hard. He agreed to write ten columns a
week; but- he wrote when he liked, and
as he was accustomed . to day work he
wrote in the daytime now, and this gave
him his evenings With Grace, an arrange
ment they, both keenly enjoyed. They
searched for, found and luxuriated in
good music, until Turnbull, who was their
frequent companion, declared that he was
at last convinced . of the truth of the
saying he had long doubted, that archi
tecture was the art most closely allied
to music. "No one merely human crea
ture could possibly have two separate en
thusiasms such as yours for architecture
and music." he said to Grace. "I see It
all; they are but two forms of the lams
"If you insist upon it," the editor said
reluctantly, "I'll give him another
chance."
"I really wish you would," Howard said
earnestly.
"Just send that fellow a note, then."
said Carson, turning to his stenographer,
"and say that he has another chance."
"Yes. sir." the stenographer replied, but
Instead of making any note he glanced
at Howard in a way which said. "As
clever a man as you are. gulled by Car
son's commonest pretense!"
"Oh, you're too soft-hearted. Paxton!
Let the fellow go. It'll teach him a les
son â to starve a little."
"No, really, Mr. Carson. I'd feel like a
thief if the man was discharged on my
account."
Howard Paxton prospered In his way
as well as did Isaac Bunton. The uneasy
fears excited by the words, of Turnbull
at their supper were soon dispelled by his
experiences at the office. There was ona
early unpleasantness, but that was ex
plained. When his first contribution to
the paper appeared, the objectionable Il
lustration to the verses also appeared in
Its place. Howard went to the office
thoroughly angry. He was glad there
was no contract; he would resign! But
before he could utter a word of protest,
when he called on Mr. Carson for that
purpose, the managing editor, who seem
ed to be In a towering rage, exclaimed:
"Well, I guess that art editor will obey
Instructions after thisâ wherever he get*
work. I declare, Paxton, I never was so
angry in my life! He needn't tell me
about not understanding orders; about
the rush of work that upset him: about
his wife and family. He should think of
his wife and family before he makes such
a blunder as to leave that picture in
your verses. And then for the stupid fel
low to come here and whine that he can't
get work anywhere else. Let him starve!"
Howard's rage instantly passed and he
was all compassion. "I was awfully put
out by that picture being run, after you
ordered it Killed; but if it's a question of
any one being discharged who needs
work I'd feel much worse to have that
done than to have my stuff pictured with
ballet cirls."

. "Daisy has changed . so much," sighed
the mother. '. f
Bhe did .hot tell her husband, that what
made her- sign' was not any change in
Daisy that. could be observed by the po
lite people they met ' now at their : own
and ;other houses.'. There, any change in
the girl was to her advantage. She 'was
cleverly imitative when she chose to be,
and her manner was now a close copy of
"He didn't say so In so many words;
but if that wasn't the' meaning of his
talk I'm more mistaken than I'm in the
habit of being." ..'
"Isaac, supposing Daisy should . change
âshould take an Interest In some man
that led to a proposalâ what should we
do aboutâ aboutâ â" .
VWhy need. ! we . say anything?" he
asked. "The old Justice who married
them is dead; no record of the marriage
exists and no one outside of the family
knows." " , .I''.".'.. 1
"Not wholly so; but It seems to me that
Is only because her pride is flattered by
his attentionâ Bhe is not interested in
him." ; . . . - â¢Â¦., â¢ . :
"I'm sorry for that Carrie, Mr. Worth
ington gave, me a very plain hint recently
that he. would favor a marriage between
Daisy and his son."
"Oh, Isaac!"
The Buntons took a furnished house
near the park, east, and were in a sur
prisingly short time very much at home
thtre. Mrs. Bunton solved the problem
of how to manage an establishment re
quiring a dozen servants for its proper
conduct, by the expedient of turning the
whole management over to a housekeep
er, who made such a liberal estimate for
expenses that, with her own tradesmen's
commissions and the cook's and butler's
stealings added to the actual expenses,
the total came near enough to the esti
mate to make complaint seem mere fault
finding. So domestic peace reigned.
Isaac approved of this plan, for his af
fairs were prosperous. It was a desirable
arrangement, too, for it gave Mrs. Bun
ton leisure to devote to Daisy's amuse
ments. These were found chiefly in the
shops, the restaurants where ladies may
go unattended and the theaters. The lat
ter fascinated Daisy. A single visit to a
popular play or light opera far from sat
isfied her. She went again and again,
and the more numerous and gay the com
pany of performers the oftener she
would see them. As she showed Â¦ a calm
purpose to go to the afternoon perform
ances alone If her mother was disposed
to rebel against a third or fourth visit
to the same playhouse within a few
weeks." Mrs. Bunton was constrained to
go, too, the more as it was evident that
Daisy would have welcomed an excuse to
go alone. When Mrs. Bunton confided
this discovery to her husband he said:
"Well, Carrie, It's a task on you, I know;
but try to endure it, for it's the first
thing Daisy has taken a real interest in
sinceâ since then." Â¦
"I wish she cared for the society of nice
people," his wife commented. " Since we
dined at the Worthingtons' a number. of
the people we met there, and others, have
called on us. I know they were asked to
call by Mrs. Worthington. Some of the
young men are very nice, and seem dis
posed to be attentive to Daisy; but she Is
the same here as at homeâ capricious, or
careless, or cynical to tnem."
"Is she that way to young Worthing
ton?" Oiv
prepared with an answer," Grace replied,
with another smile. , "But hereâ I am
dumb."
"But you must not lack confidenceâ In
New York of all places."
Mian Paxton. shall I see her?" the widow
replied, "My boarder, Miss Paxton, Is sure
to he home in a few minutes with my
daughter. They are attending the School
.of Design togetherâ and here they are."
And there they were, to be sure, for
a voice in the hall called out sturdily,
"Tea. tea; bread and Jam; oh. how
nearly starved we am! Where are you,
mamma?"
Mrs. Worthington had not seen Misa
Hartley since the days when she took
her airing on the avenue with a nurse
maid, and now, when two young women
burst into the little parlor, laugning and
keeping step to the refrain, "Tea, tea,
bread and 1am," she looked from one to
the other keenly, to see if she could de
cide which was the Westerner who had
captured the affections of her eon. Her
Instinct quickly and correctly decided
upon the taller of the two. the one with
big dark eyes, who, discovering a
stranger, blushed, stopped swinging the
picture -hat she held In one hand, and
gave a mass of brown hair a hasty, des
perate sweep with the other band. In a
hope that its workroom disorder would
abate somewhat.
Mrs #i Worthlngton made_ an cnfashlon
ably long call; waited for and partook of
tea, bread and jam: waited to hear all
about Miss Hartley's studies, end, to ex
press her surprise that such an Institu
tion as the School of Design was nourish
ing In New York and she never hear of
It; waited to refresh Mrs. Hartley with
gossip of the set, exactly as If that lady
was still a member: but never did she
seem to take more than casual notice
of Grace, after politely putting the one
or two conventional questions required
by the fact that It was Grace, after all,
whom she had called on.
But when she was on her way home
she canvassed Grace: every point In her
appearance, . her voice, manner, every
word she had spoken, every detail.
Grace was a little nervous about re
turning that call, until Mrs. Hartley
agreed to go w!th her. "I must go,"
she eald, "for one good card deserves
another, so I might as well go when you
do/ Miss Paxton. 1 probably shall not
have the privilege of meeting Mrs. Worth
ington again In another dozen years or
more; but that is. nothingâ in New York."
The call developed nothing of a terrify
ing nature. There were several other
women there, and, to Grace's surprise,
a few^men: but no one took much notice
of any one else; no more or less, cer
tainly, than they did of Grace, and aftep
a few words with the hostess Grace felt
emboldened in the general lack of Interest
any one had In any one or anything, to
Inspect "such rooms of the great house
as were opened and thrown together. She
became much Interested in this and was
glad that her professional curiosity was
not Â¦ Â¦_ observed â though : sometimes she
caught Mrs. Worthington glancing at her:
"Just to see that ,1 don't get lost, I sup
pose," thought Grace. When she went,
with Mrs. Hartley, to say good-by ' to
Mrs. Worthington, the .hostess said,
"You are going in for . architectural de
signing, my, son tells me." .' Â¦ â¢
"Yes," Grace replie'd. /'When : we left
White" River ', I felt prepared" to design
the decorations of a palace or a theater.
But now"â she smiledâ "I would , not un
dertake to : decorate a doll's house. ~ My 1
I have a year of the principles of archi
tecture, before I am allowed even to un
dertake a conventional* detail."
."You have been looking at our decora
tions here. What do you think of them?'*
"In White River I should have been
the best models she saw; and. with the
exception of young men , whose Interest
seemed to have a sentimental leaning, her
new acquaintances found her quietly
frank and amiable. But - Mrs. Bunton
saw another side of Daisy; saw that her
interest In the theaters she most fre
quented was more in the performers than
In the performance. Daisy had already
picked up an acquaintance with other
young women, who, like her, were per
sistent matinee goers, and their talk was
of the men on the stage. The mother saw
that it was in this life that the girl's
whole real Interest was centered â aside
from the one thing they never mentioned.
Yet Daisy did not eeem to be wayward
mindedâ she was willful, ratherâ and If It
had not been for the appearance of tho
thing, her mother would have as freely
.trusted her to go out alone now as in the
unconventional days of White River. The
love Bho bore even for the memory of
Harry Lawton would save her from ac
tual evil, her mother believed.
"Her brother. Good, honest, stanch
pride; and her eyesâ did 1 mention them?
âare dark and clear, and kind, and sweet
andâ why, what's the matter, mamma?"
"Nothing, my son. Those electric lights
Just there. Yes, turn out that cluster.
They rather hurt my 'ryes. Were you go
ing to your club? Good night, my dear."
"Nan," said Mr. Worthington when
they were alone, "I have a plan. We'll
not let Jack know until you've seen and
formed a Judgment of the young person,
but If Miss Bunton seems to be a desira
ble wife for him, why, don't you see, we
can have him marry her, and then the
landâ did you speak to me?"
"Were you awake when Jack talked to
me just now?" .
"I don't think I've slept."
Â¦ "Then, didn't you hear Jack tell me that
he's In love with Miss Paxton?"
"In love? Truly, I must have dozed!
I did not once hear the word love."
"He said it a hundredâ a thousand
times. Oh, my son!"
Grace made her home with widowed
Mrs. Hartley and her daughter Florence,
who, happily for Grace's plans, was a
student at the School of Design. .They
lived in an old-fashioned neighborhood
of the East Side, about midway between
Madison square and the Park, but not so
far off the avenue that It could not be
found by Mrs. Worthineton's coachman
with only a little trouble. Tho small wis
taria-covered dwelling, and a little income
âa very little oneâ was ull that the late
Mr. Hartley left of a once respectable
fortune; so the widow had fallen Into a
social obscurity from a former luster
which can be Judged when it is said that,
upon receiving Grace's address, Mrs.
Worthington distinctly recalled Mrs.
Hartley as a person she once knew.
Therefore, as Mrs. Worthington Is the
,most tactful woman in New York, when
she was received by the widow Hartley,
she greeted her as if they had parted but
yesterday, and met now, as always,
friends, equals.
Mrs. Hartley, not being much more
lonely now than during the festive life
time of the departed Hartley, had accept
ed widowhood apd reduced, Income with
cheerful philosophy, and was in a frame
of mind now to enjoy the great Mrs.
Worthington' s pose without bitterness or
cynicism.. "Nan Worthington ; deserves
all her good fortune." she thought, "for
It never spoiled her."
Mrs. Hartley was above making pre
tense as to her worldly state, so; when
Mrs. Worthington said, "And your visitor,
"Howard?"
"Let's see: she's Jolly, without being
giggly, and can droop her eyelidsâ not
nonsense â not. you know "
"Yes, I know."
"And Is awfully proud of Howard."
"So you've said."
"Bkes us!" che cried, pinching his
cheek. "We reed not be serious, need
we? Of course, If you have accepted
their hospitality. I shall call on the girl-
Miss Advocate, did you say?"
"Yes. Miss Grate Advocate Paxton."
"And what Is she like?".
"She? Well, if it comes to that, she's
a girl, too."
"Daughters all girls! Peculiar White
River," murmured his mother.
"But another kind of girl. She goes In'
for serious work."
"Charity, temperance or woman's
rights?"
"Architectural decoration."
"Goodness, Jack!"
"Plays like an angel!"
"Harp?"
"Piano. Sings bully, andâ andâ what
did you want to know particularly, mam
ma?"
"As to eyes and hair, for Instance. You
remember the iron-ore girl's."
"But Miss Paxton Is different."
"Really, Jack. I cannot extend my call
ing list indefinitely. It's getting rather
crov.-dtd with nobodies again, and need3
pruning."
."I shouldn't ju#t call the Paxtons 'no
bodies,' mamma," he said in a tone that
made her look at him with sudden scrut
iny. "Besidesâ I thought I had mentioned
itâ they have entertained me at their
home."
His sister. Miss Paxton."
"Sir, she is so," Jack answered Just as
solemnly.
"Then," said the head of the house of
Worthington, with deep meaning "I see a
way to get that Bunton land into the fam
ily without buying it."
"What in ever can papa be hinting at!
said Jack, winking at his mother.
"A marriageable daughter, and the only
child. Ah!" said Mr. Worthington in a
tone of solemn mystery. "Ah!"
"Your father is a tremendous social
diplomat," Mrs. Worthington said to her
eon, shaking her head at him, to keep
him from laughing.
"And, mamma," eaid Jack suddenly,
"There are some other peop.e here from
White River you must call on. You've
heard me speak of Paxton? The chap the
papers call the 'White River Advocate
Man.' He's here."
"Is it White River etiquette that I
should call on him?" she asked, smiling.
IXâ THE TWO WHITE RIVER GIRLS.
Borne readers of this page have already
made acquaintance with Mr. and Mrs.
John Worthington In another history of
days like these. In the years during
which his eldest son gradually emerged
from the restricted world governed by his
high-priced tutors Into the larger world of
society and affairs John Worthington Sr.
had changed but little. His rounded
ehoulders had expanded a little, making
his resemblance to an Inverted pyramid
a little more marked; his face had grown
a little more gray, making It a little more
dimcult to discover the fact that he wore
ehort gray side whiskers; a little more
pronounced was his manner of determined
and ponderous amiabilityâ as if, whatever
the Justification, he would never be sur
prised into displaying by his expression
how far beneath him was the world In
general. He still believed that he was a
person, not an institution; he still thought
that the "Worthington interests" were In
some manner controlled by him, and that
the people really in charge of the many
end mighty affairs known as the Worth
ington interests were directed by him. No
one ever sought to disabuse his simple
mind of that harmless delusion, and he
attended board meetings, councils, confer
ences with his accustomed bearing of
having something to do there besides to
give his consent, and when required his
signature, to the decisions and results of
the managers who actually forwarded the
Industrial and commercial and financial
Interests which combined to make the
fortune vested in his name, but with
whose direction or control he had no more
to do than the man In the street.
Mrs. Worthington, who had been the
beautiful Nan Lansing, rejoiced more
than she had over any other thing that
had come into her serene, smiling life
when she saw that her flr6t-born, Jack,
had in inheriting her strong mental fiber
Inherited her calm determination to rule
where he reigned. When at an early age
he came into contact with the men In
charge of the Worthington interests and
they undertook to train him Into the re
spectable figurehead required as a con
sistent successor of his father they were
surprised to see him show a good-natured
purpose, quite in his mother's manner, to
learn whatever he should know to equip
himself to be the real head of the Worth
ington Interests. His mother rejoiced to
see that her son was to redeem the af
fairs of the family into the family hands.
The crumpled rose leaf which disturbed
the serenity of her repose was that her
husband was but a ward In the hands of
men who took only perfunctory pains to
make a show of treating him otherwise
than as a piece of office furniture.
Jackâ John Worthington Jr.â had taken
a lively interest in the quiet preliminary
plans linger way for the formation of a
great consolidation of iron Industries, in
which Worthington capital was to be
largely invested, but the final plans of
which were being delayed by the failure
to secure an Important piece of mining
lf.r.d owned by a man named Isaac Bun
ton. An interest opposing the Worthing
trriF' had offered Bunton a large sum for
the l*nd, and since then both sides had
tried without surcrss to secure It. or bring
Bunton Into the deal. The village coal
and iron merchant's actions had puz
zled both eides in the rivalry. He was
discovered to be a shrewd fellow, but it
was not thought that he fully realized
how Important it was to the promoters
of the deal that, before Its perfection,
they should have control of that partic
ular ore body. The fact was that, with
out Its control by the Worthington com
bination, a rival would always be threat
ening; and with Its control a successful
rivalry would be Impossible. Only the
two interests struggling for the leader
ship in the proposed combination had in
formation that the Bunton land was. in
truth, the center of a deposit of rich and
easily mined ore, proved to be so by se
cret developments on all sides of it, of
which Bunton himself could have no ex
act knowledge. Why, then, would he not
sell?
On the evening that Howard made his
first appearance In the editorial rooms of
the Morning Chronicle Jack Worthington
told his father and mother the story or.
his latest failure to bring Mr. Bunton to
terms. "He's a curious chap," said Jack,
"or rather he Is curiously minded about
this lard of his. In other things he seems
to be a straightforward sort of fellow."
His mother, who had seemed to be but
slightly interested In the details of the
story, looked up now with a sudden In
terest, and repeated, "Straightforward?"
"Did I say straightforward?" her son
asked. "I might have said common
place."
"You might have said Hoboken," she
said, smiling, "but what you did say was
"straightforward." I'm dreadfully disap
pointed for your sake. Jack. I hoped
you'd make a success of this â believed
you would." She was silent for a moment
and then eald with the conviction of
voice and manner that women use only
when they have formed an opinion Intui
tively: "Then Mr. Bunton Is dishonest."
"Noneense. Nan!" This from the sen
ior Worthington. "Mr. Bunton is â he is
âIs a man ofâ of property."
"Then of course he can't be dishonest,"
she said, laughing good-naturedly at him.
"I'd like to see the honest gentleman."
"I was about to tell you," Jack said.
"They are In town, and as they enter
tained ' me out there you must call on
them."
"Certainly," said his mother. "You say
'them,' Jack: how many of them?"
"Mr. and Mrs. and Miss Bunton."
"Like what, for instance."
"Personally? Oh, father and mother
like any one you'd meet anywhere.
Mother a quiet, well mannered woman,
somewhat disciplined by daughter, I
Bhould say. Was a echoolma'am, I seem
to have heard. Pa Bunton. rather nerv
ous chap; seems to like to have his wom
en going it sociallyâ in a White River
way."
"And the daughter?"
"Yes. the daughter!" Joined In Mr.
Â¦Worthington with awakened interest.
"The daughter?â oh, she's aâ why, she's
a Elrl."
"Indeed!" exclaimed Mrs. Worthington
in pretended amazement. "I rather fan
cied her being a boy."
"Well, she'sâ let me see," Jack said,
puckering his brows. "She's decidedly a
good looker."
"Good looker? What's the English for
that?" asked his mother, raising her
brows.
"I thought, mamma dear, that you
might know the song in which the soul
ful line occurs: 'She's a corking good
looker! SeÂ«?' But. of course, If you only
speak English, and know no Manhattan
ese "
"Please, Jack!"
"Well, then; Miss Bunton has two
rather large blue eyes with which she is
not at all afraid to look at youâ meaning
any one â with assurance. She has hair
which, as 1 recall, was of a flufflness.
She sings the songs of Broadway with a
dash quite surprising to hear in White
River; and generally tangles the hearts of
the swains of them parts, as the poet
says. In a manner sad -to contemplate;
and "
"I think that will do," his mother Inter
rupted hopelessly.
"Is this young person of a marriage
able age?" asked his father solemnly.
i
The change In hla comparrlan shocked
end pained Howard. He would have left
him, had he been certain that Carson
would soon be there. He waited, talking
on different subjects; Turnbull sometimes
replying In his natural manner, but fall-
Ing again Into a sneering repetition of his
remarks about Carson. The managing
editor came at last, and he and Turnbull
walked with Howard to the door of his
lodging-house. While struggling with the
unfamiliar door lock Howard overheard
Turnbull eay to some remonstrance of
Carson's. "Oh, you needn't fear! I've
promised to dine with Paxton to-morrow
evening, eo you needn't fear for me this*
time. I'll go home to-night."
"I don't understand you," Howard said,
stiffening, but only slightly, for he was
clow ever to take offense, and from this
man Â¦was ready to excuse much.
Turnbull stared as If his thoughts had
been overheard. "I beg your pardon," he
paid. "Try to believe that I did not say
that. Ycu found them all very pleasant
at the office to-night?"
"Very! Cordial, and most eager that
I thould be pleasantly and agreeably sit
uated there."
" 'Cordial, and most eager that I
should be pleasantly and agreeably sit
uated there,' " echoed Tumbull. He drank
moodily for a time, while Howard fin
ished his supper, but when Howard eald
that he must bÂ« going, Turnbull asked
him to wait until Carson came, and they
would find Howard'6 lodgings for him.
He finished his wine, and with a sudden
change of manner and voice that sug
gested a wholly different person, said:
"Carson's an honest man. I know that
he's an honest man, and he knows that I
know it. That's what keeps us such good
friends; such close friends. I'm squeezed
âbut not dropped. Carson Is euch an
honest man â and knows that I know it!"
He turned from the subject and talked
briphtly of the m^n about them, and of
their work. lie was one of the Chron
icle's special writers; and said that if
Howard withed he would arrange to have
him in his room, in which thtre was a

de.ieht. He never met a man so charm
ing .id attracti've. Turnbull had finished

"I'll not urge you," he said. He looked
at the untouched dish before him,
shrugged his shoulders and turned to the
waiter and ordered a bottle of cham

"A contract?"

witty. Now, sir. If you will "
But he got no further In his Intention
to ask an explanation. Bannister's arms
flew around his neck, then he wrur.g his
hands, put an arm under Howard's and
hurried him up the street, saying In a
rush of words: "I am a triple donkey' I
am a thistle-eating ass! Forgive me?
Say that you hate and despise, loathe
abominate me, but that you i can forgive
me! I thought your lip curled In derision;
that you gibed me; thatâ I am an Insti
tution full of Idiots! I shall end my
worthless lifeâ that is nothing! Say. first.
that you forgive me!"
He was so honestly in an agony of hu
miliation that Howard said with real
concern: "I forgive you. But what the
devil Is the matter?"
Howard could but comply -with the In
vitation, for already xh* other passen
gers were showing an embarrassing In
terest In him and his companion. On tha
sidewalk Bannister again demanded:
"Will you tell me what you ware laugh-
Ing at?"
"If It Is your purpose to insult nsa, tir."
Bannister hissed. "I only ask that you
do it elsewhereâ on the sidewalk. Will
you bto with me?"
This young man Howard had noticed
because of his peculiarly determined cast
of features' and a temperament which,
with lightning-like swiftness, changed his
mood from one of hearty, laughing frank
ness to violent storms of protest, invec
tive or despair. He would break on? from
some explosion of emotion that Howard
feared would end his life, and with a
Quick smile look over to Howard in a
way so engaging that Howard could but
smile at him In return. On his way up
town for Graceâ he had stopped at the
club at a favorite gathering hour before
dinnerâ he was Joined In the surface car
by the pale-faced youth of violent â¢no

young man's name, iat by Howard's side
and talked with exceeding volubility and
with highly un-American but expressive
use of eyes, shoulders and hsnrts In em
phasis and explanation of sentiments. He
praised Howard's work extravagantly and
showed a familiarity with It that was
flattering. Then with a sigh he became
silent and bis manner denoted a deep of
melancholy, emergence from which would
seem to require a miracle. Howard, fear
ing to disturb this settled sadness, began
reading the advertisements in the car.

ceeded to copy some of thoeo In rhym*.
He was making a collection of them and
eagerly sought new specimens. la this
Innocent employment he was rudely dis
turbed by hearing Bannister hiss In his
ear: "Six, I demand to know what you
are laughing at!"
"Was I laughing?" asked Howard,
startled at the other's intensity.
"That Is a Quibble, sir. You were smil
ing."
"One may smile, and not bÂ« a Ttflarn."
Howard suggested.
They were dining, as Turnbull's guests,
at a little club whose members were near
ly all writers or artists. The dub was
housed In the first floor and basement of
an old residence In a street far enough
down town to be convenient for morning
newspaper men who must return to work
after dinner, and to Howard was on* of
the chief attractions of New York. When

A poet whose verses had touched with

"But," said Grace, "architecture is Â«ili

Did he? He would have thought any

fast-changing emotions, "but I am on my
way to my sister's."
' Bannister took Howard's arm again
and ruFhed him into a flower shop. There
he purchased a bunch of expensive roses.
and turned to Howard with an entirely
new manner, the suavity and gentleness
of a well-bred man, and said, "Pray, Mr.
Paxton, send these to your sister, with
an apology, and dine with me. Tell your
sister that you are doing an act of mercy,
charity, and that I am her grateful slave
from now through eternity."
Howard assented to the proposal, for
his interest was keenly aroused in his
companion. The roses and a note of ex
planation sent to Grace, the men
started from the florist's when Bannister
etopped. struck his forehead violently
and exclaimed, "No, we will not dine as
princes dine, but as the gods! How I
love her! Love! do I say. Adoration,
worship are but futile â oh. heavens, we
have quarreled 1 Where Is your tele
phone?" he demanded of a clerk.
The clerk pointed to a little booth
v.here patrons might telephone with the
discretion the Bending of flowers some
times demands, and Bannister led the
way there. As he was about to enter the
booth he stopped and said, "No! Not my
voice! Not my voice too suddenly. You
call her and speak for me."
Howard called for and obtained the tel
ephone whose number Bannister gave him
and a trembling voice asked, "Is that
you, George?" "I am speaking for Mr.
George Bannister," Howard said. "Ask
her." whispered Banister hoarsely, "If I
am forgiven." Howard forwarded the In
quiry and the voice assured him that
there was nothing to forgive and asked
tearfully if George was not coming to
dinner. The lady's Â«tate of mind being
explained by Howard, over his shoulder,
he was Instructed to Inform the voice that
George was its devoted and humble slave,
which being done, the voice asked if
George would not take the telephone in
person. He did eo and swore that some
thing had been entirely hlÂ» fault; that
he was a miserable wretch who had been
no better than a murderer to say that It
â¢was her fault and could he bring Mr.
Howard Paxton to dinner? Yes, It was
the Mr. Paxton he had talked to her
about, and the needn't dress with too
much formality, as they were coming up
dressed as thÂ«y were.
Howard was greatly amused by these
performances, for he had heacd some
thing of Bannister that had led him to ex
pect a very different sort of person.
Turnbull had told him that the young
man. after two or three years' tumultu
ous career In Paris, where he seemed to
have done a number of other things be
eldes improving himself in art. ' returned
to New York with a boisterous convic
tion that literature held all the prizes
that were worth striving for and that
he was peculiarly qualified to win them.
He might have humbly advanced to
ward literature, as others are said to
have done, by way of Journalism, except
for a temperamental tendency to fight
every editor who dared to lay a disparag
ing pencil across eo much as a lineâ a
wordâ of his writing. Having. In white
rage, informed most of the editors that
they were oafs, wallowing in a mire of
intellectual incapacity, he was con
etrained to abandon Journalism: and, by
chance, took up the work of writing and
Illustrating advertisements. This work
paid well, and while not entirely satisfy
ing his literary ambitions, it did satisfy
a stronger oneâ to be financially independ
ent of his father; an eccentric, but fabu
lously prosperous corporation lawyer,
who scoffed at his Â£>n's lowly vocation.
When he first met him at the club How
ard had no idea that Bannister was the
commercial author and poet of whom
Turnbull had told, and the revealed iden
tity had strengthened the first lively in
terest he felt In the man. What could
the lady be like who had won his ardent
affections? he wondered, as they drove
up town to the west of the park. That
touch about her not being strong enough
to suddenly hear his telephonic voice
pave a hint. A tender, pining young
thing, eurely. Howard concluded. They
alighted from their cab in front of a
smart little four-story bnck cottage, one
of a row of such in a street near the
southern end of the Riverside Drive, and
Bannister, after liberally tipping the
driver (whom, however, he called a cai
tiff, and told that his horse had died long
ago), sprang up the steps, rushed past
the maid at the door, crying. "Gertrude!
Love! My heart'8 Jewell Forgive!"
Thus calling, he disappeared, and How
ard wondered how. IX at all. he was to
be ushered Into Gertrude's presence, when
the maid, as if not at ail surprised at
what had occurred, said very calmly,
"Will you step into the parlor, eIt?
They'll be there Â¦oon."
Howard entered a little, brilliantly
lighted room that had a cozy, homelike
feeling of being much lived In by com
fortable, cozy people. An old lady, white
haired, but pink-cheeked, was seated In
an easy chalr_ reading an evening paper.
Bhe rose as Howard entered, and said in
a. placid tone, "I am glad to see you, Mr.
Paxton. Will you take an evening paper
and read?" She pointed to a dozen on a
table. "My daughter, Mrs. Carr, will be
here boos." Bhe sank back In her chair
and resumed her reading, but looked over
the top of the paper to say, "Their rec
onciliations axe speedily effected, and"
She did not finish the sentence, being
fascinated, it seemed, by the headlines of
the paper. Howard had little time to
wonder if Mrs. Carr was the one whom
he had telephoned to, for. In a minute.
Bannister entered the room, his arm
around the waist of a very plump, a
very smiling, a very blonde, a very cozy
and comfortable looking young woman,
who did not appear to be more than 20
years old, and who, Howard concluded,
could not be Mrs. Carr. But Bannister,
beaming brightly, advanced, saying, "Ger
trude, Mrs. Carr, heart of my soul, dream
of my heart, soul of my dreams, this Is
Mr. Paxtoa." , n
Mrs. Carr put eat a pretty little hand,
bearing a great many diamonds, and said,
"It was so good of George to insist upon
your coming, and for 70a to come.
Mamma, this Is"â â
"I have met Mr. Paxton." said mamma,
cot looking up from her paper. "George,"
she added, with the first Interest that
had appeared In her manner, "did you
bring op the night editions?"
George took late editions of the evening
papers from all the pockets of his coat
and gave them to the old lady, who re
ceived them eagerly, and until dinner was
announced a half hour later neither
moved nor Bpoke.
If the gods dine as they please, and do
not dine as the four at the table of Mrs.
Marbleâ Howard chanced to learn that
mamma's name was Marbleâ dined that
night, then the gods fail to take advan
tage of their highest privilege.
But Howard's interest was more in the
people than In the dinner. To be sure,
Mrs. Marble did not give him all the op
portunity to observe the young lovers
that he would have liked. When she
learned that he was from White River
and knew Isaac Bunton. she cross-exam
ined him searchlngly as to his knowledge
of Bunton's actions In delaying the forma
tion of the big Iron Combine. When
It appeared that Howard did not
know of Mr. Bunton's contumacy In
that respect, and. was hardly aware
of the publicly known, plans of . the
Iron Crowd, as she called the pro
moters of the combine, she regarded him
with distinct loss of favor. "Here Is
George, whose father Is the chief attor
ney for the Worthlngton Interest, and
George knows no more about the iron
dealâ though every one knows that the
Worthlngton interest is heavily engagedâ
than if his father was a candlestick
maker. Though, as far as that goes, his
father, Caleb Bannister, Is a hard hearted,
soulless "
"Mother!" cried Mrs. Carr, but Mrs.
Marble, quite undisturbed. Bald, "If you
know Mr. Caleb Bannister better than I
do, Gertrude, perhaps you will tell Mr.
Paxton what he 1Â«."
"He Is George's father," Gertrude said
reproachfully.
"Pish!" Mrs. Marble exclaimed, and
then to Howard: VThere will be Bome
money on the first of July that must be
reinvested. If vour Bunton stands like
a dosr In a manger, holding up this plan,
the stork will not be ready to be Issued
by that time, and I want some at that
time."
"Madam!" suddenly exclaimed Bannis
ter, "my father shall acknowledge that
he was wrong. He shall call upon you.
I swear ltl" **?
""Well, you know what will never hap
pen until he does," replied Mrs. Marble
grimly. To Howard's surprise and dis
tress Gertrude burst into tears and Ban
nister into a passion of protests that he
was the "most miserable, the most help
less of mortals. "I am a futile dupe!"
he cried in a frenzy. "My father sees me
with heaven almost within my grasp, and
mercilessly stays my eager hands!"
"If you g-g-gave up your wr-wr-wrlting,
and went Into h-h-hls law office," sobbed
Gertrude, "he would be more d-d-disposed
to-to "
Bannister interrupted her by Jumping
to his feet and hissing. "You hate me!"
"George! George, dear!" she cried.
"You taunt me with not doing all in my
power to end this wicked strife that is
keeping us apart! Very well! let the river
close coldly over this undeserving, but
loving heart!"
Thereupon he rushed from the room,
and Gertrude rushed after him sobbing,
and calling to him not to destroy himself.
Howard was seriously concerned for his
friend, and would have followed to lend
a man's strong arm to Gertrude In her
struggle to keep the unhappy lover from
doing himself harm. But Mrs. Marble's
action held him from his purpose. That
lady called a servant and said, "We will
not have dessert served until Mrs. Carr
and Mr. Bannister return."
The absent ones' voices could be heard
from the next room, gradually subsiding
from their Btormy pitch, and thus reas
sured, thouih much bewildered, Howard
was glad t# have Mrs. Marble explain a
little. 1/
"This has been going on with but one
brief interval since Gertrude was six and
George nine years old. They were en-
Raged when they were yet mere chil
drenâseventeen and twenty, or some
euch agesâ but the Bannisters and I quar
reled: the children had a more than us
ually violent quarrel, also. George went
to Paris, where the reports of him wereâ
well he did not seem to be Improving his
morals thereâ and Gertrude married. I
admit that I approved the marriage-
Caleb Bannister can console himself
with that. If It will do him any goodâ
and Gertrude would have died within a
year, I now admit that; but heaven .was
Just and merciful. Mr. Carr was called
hence six months after the marriage. His
Investments had been well made, and he
had been unable to waste more than the
Income. There were noâ no encum
brances. It was a nightmare, but it is
all over."
The lovers returned, as calmly smiling
as if no more than a caressing June-day
zephyr had ever rippled the placid cur
rent of their true love. Gertrude was
hungry for dessert, and ate It with a
sturdy appetite that much comforted
Howard to observe; bo eloquent of a rest
ful heart it was to see her consume a
plateful of bonbons, and then put as much
sugar in her black coffee as it would dis
solve.
After dinner, while the lovers loved and
quarreled, and loved again, somewhat
apart, Mrs. Marble returned to the sub
ject of Isaac Bunton. Howard was sur
prised not only by the eagerness, but the
keenness of her questioning, and inci
dentally the deep knowledge she seemed
to possess of all matters relating to the
world of Investments.
XIâ MISTRESS MADGB AND A MYS
TERY. â¢
That evening began a close friendship
between Howard and Bannister. "Pax
ton.-I want you to know my people,"
Bannister said one time. "I have told
them about you at home, and they want
me to bring you out there over Sunday.
My father, particularly, is eager to meet
you. Will you say Saturday next, until
Monday?" Howard did eay so.
"It's only right to tell you," Bannister
continued, "that we are a family of ec
centrics. That is, all but me. I'm the
only normal member of the family.
Fatherâ well, you see the stories about
him in the papers. They call him a mis
anthrope, a recluse, a charger of mon
strous fees, a defender of trusts â nearly
everything but a poor lawyer. But he Is
the gentlest, the kindest, the sweetest
hearted man in seven worldsâ except"
And the exception had to do, of course,
with the cruelty of his father In not ad-*
Justing a certain feud between the
houses of Bannister and Marble, so that
two loving hearts might cease to be torn
apart, but dwell together in oneness and
affection. "Mother," continued Bannister,
"is the loveliest woman beneath the can
opy of heaven, but to strangers she may
appear to be somewhat frivolous. Sister
Madge, so far as a mere child's charac
ter can be Judged, combines the eccen
tricities of our parents, but has gleams
of my singularly same and reposeful na
ture."
With this key to the family character
istics well In mind, Howard accompanied
his friend on a suburban train, prepared
to encounter almost any variety of hu
man natureâexcept the varieties he did
encounter. At a station where many
ether passengers alighted, and where a
â¢core of fashionably appointed vehicles,
varying from carts to four-in-hands, were
In waiting. Bannister gave his own and
his guest's hand baggage to a liveried
footman, with the inquiry: "How la
father, James T"
"It's Brussels sprouts, Mr. George," re
plied the man solemnly.
They drove something more than a
mile through a country of beautiful
homes surrounded by extensive and ex
quisitely kept grounds; and on all sides
were lively evidences of the outdoor coun
try life of wealthy New Yorkers; tennis
courts alive with players, the- rolling ex
panse of emerald golf links, dotted with
brightly dressed followers of the game;
coaching parties rolled along the well
kept roads, or bareheaded riders ambling
gayly on the soft earth by the Bide of the
paved highway. Howard had never be
fore seen one of the playgrounds for
which fashionable New York deserts its
streets and parks at week-end, . and the
sights charmed him bo that he forgot his
companion, until, the carriage Blowing,
Bannister said, "We'll get out here and
walk through .the grounds."
They were at* an opening in a hedge,
from which a graveled path led first
through an orchard, then Into a meadow
and garden.
"This is where father work* and Madge
plays," Bannister said, as they strode up
the path, now and then catching glimpses
of a large, rambling building, beyond
meadow and garden. "From the first vlo
let In the spring to the last earthing up
of celery In the fall, my distinguished
papa fusses with plant life, interfering
with the gardeners and lawn keepers,
making our vegetables cost us -fabulous
sums, but preserving his health and con-,
vinclng himself that he's a scientific
farmer."
Howard was not attending to the prat
tle of his friend; he heard something that
much more engaged his attention; a
sweet. Joyous laugh, unarfec ted, hearty,
gayly unconsciousâ the dearest sound on
earth; the laugh of pure physical happi
ness, springing from the light heart of a
girl. Something in the sound moved
Howard as if he had suddenly heard the
mocking bird's gallant outpouring of
brave music. He stopped, his face flushed
and his eyes sparkled. Bannister, noting,
said. carelessly, "Oh, It's only Madgel
come along."
"Madgeâ your little sister?"
"It's Madge," Bannister replied, looking
at his friend, then smiling. "But she
Isn't little. There Â«be Isâ what the devil
âlook. Paxton. Oh, this Is a fine Joke to
have on Madge!"
What Howard first saw in the meadow
through the orchard trees was a youth
of fourteen or so, falling on a footballâ
either In a holdover enthusiasm from
the season past or an early outcropping
of enthusiasm for the season to co â¢*-
The youth having recovered the bail
passed it, and, following Its flight witn
his eyes, Howard saw It neatly caught
by a young woman. She stopped
laughing as she poised the bail and
estimated . with critical eye the di
rection and distance of the y oun *
man. Then there was a swish of
skirts, a second's glimpse of a Â«*outly
shod, shapely foot, and the bal went
hurtling fari and true. She watched Its
fortunes, lips' parted, eyes gleaming, and
as the boy fumbled she cried, "Fall on It,
Jones; fall on it!" '
Jones did so, and bavini picked
it and himself up passed the bail
back again. The girl affaln poised
for a kick. but Bannister. who
with Howard had now reached tne
edge of the open, laughed. At the sound
she turned, startled; her eyes flashed
scorn at her brother, her lips trembled,
as if she would speak if Indignation had
not stricken her dumb. Suddenly she
hurled the ball at her brother, gathered
her skirts around her, turned and ran.
Bannister dodged the ball, which Howard
caught; and handling it like an expert,
he kicked it to master Jones, with such,
force and precision that that unseasonable
enthusiast was bowled over. "Oh. Mr.
BannlBter!" he cried when he had righted
himself, "I wish your friend would kick
for me "a little."
"Madge seemed to be doing pretty well
for you," Bannister said.
"Well enough for a girl." the youth ad
mitted Indulgently. "But you know that
a man can't get good practice unless a
man is playing with him. After the rain
the other day Madge kicked her overshoe
off and it flewâ my!â clean over the
trees 1"
Howard saw no more of Madge that
afternoon, though he was conscious of a
singularly strong hope that he might.
Â¦Nor did he meet any other member of the
family. Mrs. Bannister, it appeared, was
giving a tea at the neighborhood Country
Club, and Mr. Bannister was at a farm he
owned in the vicinity, struggling with
the problem of making some of the cab
bage of Brussels turn Into sprouts and
not all into stalk. George and Howard
drove far about the country until It was
time to dress for dinner. "Sorry to put
you to the trouble of dressing, out here in
the country." George said, "but my
mother holds to the belief that the eftener
a man changes his clothes the less fre
quently he commits murder."
George had bo far completed his own
dressing that he was struggling, in a
stcrm of extravagant Invective, with the
problem of tying a strip of lawn about his
collar without wrinkling the lawn or
bringing on apoplexy, when Madge
knocked, and being asked to enter, did so
only as far as one stride, and then hissed,
"Animal!"
Her brother let her see his smiling- re
flection in the mirror, but made no re
ply.
"Unnatural brotherl Hideous, base,
boorish "
"Bubbling bouncer," George suggested,
as she hesitated for a word.
She was dressed for dinner, all in white
and dainty blue, and looked charmingly
feminine, in spite of her tragically folded
arms, lowering brows and angry eyes.
"Don't think you can make a Jest of
this, George Bannister!" she said, stamp
ing her foot, and shaking her head at his
grinning reflection. "What right had you
to enmp in through the orchard with a
Btranger? Why did you not drive to the
front of the house like a Christian, and
not subiect me. your own sister, to the
gross humiliation, the unthinkable shame
of being discovered in an attitude ofâ ofâ
George Bannister, what are you grinning
at? you appalling ape!"
"He's going to look for the rubber you
kicked off the other day, and write a
poem on it," her brother said, snatching
off another lawn tie and throwing It on
the floor where a half dozen lay.
"I'll box that Jones boy's ears," she
exclaimed, a new variety of rage, or some
other emotion, perhaps, coloring her face.
"It wouldn't have been so miserable of
you," she continued, "if he had not been
a Btranger, or I had not been shod like
a policeman."
"Ah, but your skirts, Madge! They
were beautiful I And your stockings!
Blue, weren't they?"
"I hate you!" she cried. "You are a
person of low mind; one it were flattery
to call a coward; and I shall never speak
to you as long as I livel Blue, Indeed!"
Bhe turned to leave the room, but he
called after her coaxlngly, "Please,
Madge, won't you tie this tie for a fel
low, before you leave me forever? I'll
tell you something awfully nice if you
will."
With a swiftness and neatness that
made his masculine mind marvel she tied
a fresh bow for him and then said, "Now,
what is it, Georgle?"
"That I worship you, dear," he said,
kissing her. "Isn't that something nice?"
"Y-es," she replied doubtfully. "But
I thought you'd tell me something about
âthat isâ whyâ about him."
"Him?"
"Mr. Paxton."
"Oh/ Paxton! Well, he worships you,
too." ~"~
"George Bannister," Bhe said as Bhe
strode from the room, "you are an odious
ox!"
At dinner that evening Mrs. Bannister,
a fine, big woman, from whom Madge in
herited her blonde coloring and large
gray eyes, said to Howard, "Since my
husband gave up, general practice he
chooses to devote his leisure to the com-
panionship of earthworms. Together
they make a mess of the soil, with equal
profit and pleasure, I Judge. To me it
seems a strange choice of occupation for
a man who might become a Senator, an
Embassador, and live In civilized com
munities where social life amounts to
something. I hold that It is a man's chief
privilege, pleasure, duty, to mix as much
as possible with his fellows; to cultivate
.the graces of mind' and person which ex
pand and shine only/ when animated by
ceremonious association â In short, social
life."
The lady said this with a good deal of
conviction and emphasis, but none of her
family seemed to notice her remarks, and
she did not seem to expect them. to do so.
"Holding to this belief as I do it seems
too bad that my husband, for many years
one of the acknowledged leaders of the
American bar, should choose the compan
ionship of earthworms. Still, I find some
attractive society In this community;
and though I am without my daughter's
aid in cultivating it, as well as lacking
any help from my husband or son, it af
fords me entertainment. That is as much
as a wife can expect, I suppose, when
ambition is absent from every member of
her family. The truth Is, Mr. Paxton.
we may be described as a family of ec
centrics, for I am the only one of us who
is simply normal in my tastes and con
duct." t
It seemed to Howard that the
lady made this declaration of prin
ciples without the spirit of complaint
which the words might Imply; rather as
if one bhould say: "Let others do and
think as they may; I, at least. LavÂ© set

Judged^y the idloByncracies of others.'*
Alter a pleasant evening, during which
Howard discovered with admiration that
the members "of the family severally
avoided Jarring each other's peculiarities,
Mr. Bannister said, when there was a
movement of separation, "Mr. Paxton, If
you are not tired or sleepy, I should like
a little gossip with you alone."
The others, upon this cue, departed
promptly.
"Woud it distress you at all to speak
a little about your father7" Mr. Bannis
ter BBked abruptly when they sat alone
on a deep veranda overlooking a lawn
pricked by the flashes of a thousand fire
flies. /<
"Not in the least, shy" said Howard,
greatly surprised at the question. "Did
you know him 7"
"I never met himâ I have not trav-^
eled much farther than this' from New
Yorkâ but I have come to know your
father pretty well, I think. Dr. Paxton
was a man of hearty, sunny temperament;
breezy, open manner; optimistic, singu
larly trusting, giving his services freely
to the poor, proud and fond of his son
and daughter, rather indifferent to his
worldly affairs, until shortly before his
death he sought and obtained the post
mastership of White River to Increase
his income, for his daughter" s sake, It
seems, and â -"
"Stop, slrP' exclaimed Howard, ex
cited and amazed by this calm recital of
his father's habits, characteristics, cir
cumstances, by a man who had never
met him. "I have said that it would not
distress me to talk of my father. There
was a long time after his death when I
could not talk of him without great dis
tress, but now I can speak of him as of
a dear friend that only distance, not
death, separates from me. But first I
must know how youâ who never met
himâ come to know him, so intimately,
and for what purpose."
"Your question and the spirit in which
you ask it do credit to your heart," the
lawyer said slowly; and then paused so
long that Howard became impatient. "It's
, a good quality in a son to be as jealously
affectionate of his father as of his mother.
I think you dined at Mrs. Marble's with
my boy."
"I did," answered Howard, wondering at
this abrupt change in the subject, and
In the lawyer's manner, for he now
laughed gently as he said. "Mrs. Marble
is an old and respected client, one of the
few whose affairs I continue to manage."
"Your client!" Howard could not help
exclaimed, remembering Mrs. Marble's
expressed opinion of him.
_Mr. Bannister laughed again softly.
"Oh, she has been talking to you about
Caleb Bannister!" he said. "Yes, we
quarreled, but she is too wise an old
lady to take her business out of my
hands. We do not meet, but carry on a
sober correspondence when her affairs
require attention. My boy thinks he Is

Marh>> will not let Gertrude marry him

But they do not disturb me, as I am ac
customed to family eccentricities: being
the only normal minded person in my own
family. My wife, although a woman of
more than ordinary intelligence. Is de
voted to the tasteless, unprofitable life we
call society. My son. who might
âif he wouldâ fall heir to a legal
practice of respectable proportions

picures on the sidewalk, or some such
thing. My daughter elects to find all hu
man companionship unendurableâ so there
we are. Did you say that your fatter
consulted you about his business affairs?''
"I did not, sir. I asked why you had
taken what must have been a great deal
of pains to learn so much about him."
Mr. Bannister, who had ma<lo the di
gression only that Howard might collect
himself, noted that his voice was now
without any signs of excitement, and
said: "That is quite right. I shall talk
to you very frankly. A matter of busi
nessâof very great importanceâ led an
Interest for which I have long been the
chief counsel to make some rather secret
investigations in White ,Rlver."
He paused, while Howard leaned eagerly
forward, trying to peer Into his face.
"No," he continued, "that Is not the way
to begin. I must be wholly frank with
you. You may have seen in the papers
something about a proposed community
of Interest of a number of large Iron in
dustries. We, the interest for which . I
am counsel, require for our protection as
much as for our use. a certain niece of
mining land â undeveloped, out whose ex
tent of ore deposits has been pretty accu
rately determined. That land is owned"â
he paused and lighted a cigar before he
added with peculiar emphasisâ "or seems
to be owned, by one Isaac Bunton. When
our offers to buy that land reached a fig
ure'which fully represented Its strategic
value, so to speakâ a value far beyond its
possible intrinsic valueâ and Isaac Bun
ton still refused to sell, giving no reason
therefor, we began In Investigation to see
if a side light could not be thrown on the
situation. In a little town like White
River, with our facilities for making secret
inquiries, we soon learned all that we
wanted to know, except on one point.
Your father's name came into the reports
Â¦I received, and inquiries concerning him
showed me that no man m the commu
nity stood so deservedly high in the es
teem of all good citizens as did Dr. Pax-
ton. Now, may I ask you a few ques
tions r*
"You may," Howard said, scarcely
above his breath, for he was much af
fected by what the lawyer said, and the
manner in which he had been speaking.
"Do you chance to know for what pur
post your father borrowed five thousand
dollars on the day of his death?"
Howard, as he answered earnestly, could
not see the eagerness with which the law
yer waited for his words.
"I do not know. They made Inquiries of
me at the time, but I could give no infor
mationânot even a hint, then or now."
"He did not speak to you of a purpose?"
"No."
"Yet he was accustomed to tell you of
his plans in advance?"
"Very freely."
"Then it was a suddenly formed plan.
At the savings bank where he transacted
the loan with an official who was his
friend he only laughed when he was
asked what he wanted so much money
for. Therefore It was for some purpose
he did not wish to disclose. We may In
fer, from what we know of Dr. Paxton's
nature and character, that the probable
cause for not wanting to let the bank peo
ple know what he was going to do with
the money was that he was going to do a
favor to some oneâ make an emergency
accommodationâ to a person who did not
want it known that he was borrowing.
Can you suggest any one to whom your
father would have made such a loan?"
"No, I cannot." Howard replied, breath
lessly following- the other's reasoning.
''The sum was a large one, for trans
actions in White River at that tlme^-a
very large one. Have you no idea to
whom your father gave that sum on that
day?"
"Your information is at^ault. sir," said
Howard. "Whatever my father's Inten
tions were, they were not carried out;
the money was stolen from his body."
"The hasty and unwarranted conclu
sion of Incapable officials. That money
was not upon your father's person when
he met with that most unhappy acci
dent."
"What makes you think that?" cried
Howard, astonished.
"I speak from positive information. The
interest I represent has a carefully or
ganized detective service, one branch of
which protects Its freight cars from
tramp depredations. Members of that
branch of the service go about the coun
try with tramps and are supposed to be
tramps by their companions. Through
that branch I have learned that your
father carried no large sum of money that
night. His body was robbed, as you
know. The two robbers were tramps, one
of whom took his watch, and the other
took everything else that a thorough
search of the doctor's* clothes revealed.
The man with the watch was arrested,
as you know, and sent to prison. The
other man got a pocketbook containing a
few dollars, and a memorandum book in
which your father noted the places where
he was to call on his rounds. I have that
book. Every one of the entries under the
date of his death we found to be pa
tients, except one. That one is Isaao
Bunton. Does that suggest anything to
you?"
"No."
"The entry we have not inquired Intoâ
for we dare not yetâ reads, 'Isaac Bun
ton, 2 p. m.' That was after the hour your
father drew the five thousand dollars.
Think, young man! Does this suggest
nothing to you??
"Nothing," Howard said, startled at
the sudden vehemence of the speaker.
The lawyer sighed as In disappointment
and was silent for some time before he
resumed, now speaking calmly: "Isaao
Bunton made a considerable purchase of
pig Iron on that day, but we are balked
In our effort to learn the particulars of
the banking transaction Involved, because
his father has become a director of the
bank, and that avenue of information is
closed to us."
"You have amexsd me by what you
say," Howard said, as the lawyer ceased
speaking. "If Isaao Bunton did borrow
that money from my father, why has he
not returned It? The fact that he has not
returned It shows your suspicion to be
unfounded. It Is a small sum for him."
The lawyer, paying no attention to this
sumed . that Mr. Bannister would
have made equally searching Inquiry of
any one he chanced to meet, who had
known Mr. Bunton well in White River.
He was, to be sure, absorbingly interested
at the time in all the lawyer had to say
about his father, but he did not connect
that interest with anything Dr. Paxton's
affairs might have had to do with Isaao
Bunton's ownership of mining lands. But
even had his mind been steeped in spec
ulation as to the possible purport of the
interview, the events of the next day
would have altered the complexion of
his thoughts. Yet the day passed with
only ' such Incidents as are common to
the lives of those who have "gone back
to nature." ,
Mr. Bannister made no allusion to their
talk of the night before, but said to How
ard after breakfast, "I've had so much
to do with men that I find great satisfac
tion in studying the habits of vegetables.
You do not chance to know why the plant
of the Brussels sprout, with -a freedom of
choice in the matter, prefers to run all to
stalk and not at all to sprouts? No? It
is a quality of matter nearly akin to mind
and I thought you might have observed
it."
With these words he was off to the
farm, accompanied by a godless gard
ener.
young Mr. George Bannister, eyes dis
traught, hair disordered and manner mad,
said to Howard, "I've a soap picture to
draw and some verses on a baby food to
writeâ curse all soap; hall Infant damna
tion! â bo I must leave you to your own
resources for a few hours. If this wasn't
a family of eccentrics some one would
be about to entertain a guest But not a
soulâ only Madge. Hey, Madge I" he ex
claimed as she threw down a book and
started to dash from the room, "can't
you dig up some amusement to keep Pax
ton from dying of boredom until some
body comes to entertain him? What's the
matter with you? Womanl Cat! What
have I done?"
The wrath in her eyes was wonderful
to behold, but it was no such matter as
the scorn of her silent lipsâ though it was
plain that there was much she would
have liked to say to her brother.
"If I've offended you, Madge," cried
George. "I'm the basest beast that drags
an undeserved existence through this
world of worry and woe."
It was evident that she had to say
something or perish, so she hissed, "You
are an unapproachable bat!" Then she
fled from the room.
"Funny about little girls, isn't it?"
George said, mussing his hair with his
pencil. "Well, you Just get a book from
the shelves and fuss around the grounds
until I finish. Then we'll do something."
Howard found a promising book and
walked out to the orchard, where he sat
down on an Inviting bench, opened the
bookâ but did not read. His thoughts were
agreeableâ for they were all ot Madge â
and must have been engrossing, for the
shadows of the overhanging boughs shift
ed far before he was startled into a con
sciousness of his surroundings by a voice
directly over his head saying, "Please to
go away until I come down."
He looked up and on a high branch of
the tree saw Madge. "I'll help you
down," he exclaimed, laughing.
"Go away!" she commanded. "I hate
you. because after I left the room you
and George- laughed at me. and you said
that I was a spiteful creature and should
be taught to keep my temper."
"I neverl" Bald Howard. "Cross my
heart!"
"Go away!"
Howard rose from the bench, tied his
handkerchief over bis eyes, covered his
face with his book and the book with his
hat, and called out, ."How many must I
count?"
Instantly there was a light Jump, he
uncovered his eyes and Madge stood be
fore him, blushing and looking repentant.
v"Ifs George's fault," she said. "He
teases me to distraction, and then I do or
say something 1 that makes a stranger
think that I am as eccentric as the rest
of the Bannisters. I'm the only normally
behaved member of the family, but Just
because I'm not like the others I appear
insane, I suppose. Will you forgive me
for being rude to George In your pres-
guileless remark, suddenly asked, "Did
you know a clerk in Bunton's office
named Lawton?"
Howard laughed; relieved to have the
strain he had been under removed by this
unexpected summoning of poor Harry's
harmless spirit. "I knew him always.
He was a schoolfellow of mine until I
went Into the high school. "When poor
Harry struggled somehow through the
grammar school he went as a clerk into
Mr. Bunton's office."
"Why Bunton's office."
"He was a favorite of Mrs. Bunton's.
Bhe was always a kind hearted woman,
and had Harry's homelessness on her
mind."
"What sort was he?"
"A simple fellow. Perhaps if he had
lived in New York, under congenial cir
cumstances, he would have developed
successfully as a society clown."
"Not a young man Bunton would have
sent on a business trip into the valley?" '
"I should think not. In the office he
was something like a tally clerk and mes
senger."
Â« "Messenger? Um-m! Did you ever hear
what he was doing down In the valley
when he was killed and Isaac Bunton
alone identified his body?"
Howard -said that his father's death
made him unmindful of all other events
at that time.
There was something uncanny In the'
way the lawyer rattled off detail after
detail of seemingly unimportant and un
related events, all showing an astonishing
familiarity with Isaac Bunton's move
ments.
"When Bunton moved from the part of
your town called the Flats to the Heights
you and your sister ceased to visit the
Buntons, after a time â you must not
think me Impertinent in this or any other
question I ask â was there any special
cause for that?"
"Only that we were no longer Invited
there," Howard answered. >
"Mr. Paxton," the lawyer said, rising,
"I need not say to you how deeply I am
concerned to learn the motive behind
Bunton's action in this matter of the
mining land. The questions I have asked
you show that to you. You have helped
meâ yes, I think you have helped meâ
to come to the conclusion that there is
something not wholly honest operating
In his mind."
The great lawyer after more than a
year's study, with all the details of infor
mation the detectives furnished him, with
a trained mind directed by a peculiar de
termination to succeed In the case, had
arrived at the identical conclusion that
Mrs. Worthlngton reached intuitively
after oneVialf second's consideration.
His interview with Mr. Bannister left no
pointed impression In Howard's mind. His
impressions of men and women, and of
their intentions, were commonly formed
more from what he saw in their faces
than from what they said; and he had
not been able to see the face of the
lawyer in the pale starlight of the
veranda where they sat. As to the
subject of their talk, Howard as-
encer
' Howard assured her of his forgiveness
on condition that Â»hs would help him
"fuss around" until George came to his
rescue.
"What shall we dor* she asked. "I hate
coif; and, besides, people don't play on
Sundayâ until after church. Tennis,
same."
"How about football r* asked Howard,
gravely.
"If you're going to b* bad I'll run
away," she replied Indignantly.
"I'll be good," Howard meekly promised.
"Couldn't we sit down here and talk over
what we'll do?"
"Oh, I love to Bit In the orchard 17 she
cried; "but I didn't suggest It because
mostly It bores people to extinction. Don't
you hate people? I hate men because the
silly creatures think they're superior to
women! And I hate women because the
silly creatures are so Inferior to menl I
like horses, though. Have you a sister?
Â¦What Is she like?"
Perhaps It was the number of topics
thus impulsively launched that accounted
for the absorption of the young people
sitting In the orchard. Anyway, when
George found his friend a couple of hours
later he sneered at the discovery that
Howard was too pleasantly engaged to
welcome disturbance. "I'd thought better
of Paxton," he said to himself, "than to
be amused by a wild Indian of a girl like
Madge." and he returned to his room and
wrote a long and passionate outpouring of
love to Gertrude.
On his next visit to the Bannisters
Grace went with Howard, and was In
stantly approved by Mrs. Bannister. As
beautiful a girl as Grace was In herself
a decided attraction to the Bannister Sun
day teas and dinners. "Besides." said
Mrs. Bannister, "Miss Paxton Is a clever
girl, and wM have an influence on Madge.
Miss Paxton likes men. she likes women,
she likes her kind, as sane people should;
and a girl like Madge Is more Inclined to
follow the example of a girl of her own
age than to follow the precepts of her*
own mother. And MJss Paxton taking up
this studyâ what do you call it? house
painting 1 â makes her so Interesting."
One of the members of the neighbor
hood Country Club who seemed to ap
prove of Mrs. Bannister's enthusiasm over
Grace was Mr. Jack Worthlngton. He
was not a new visitor at the house; he
had been an Intimate there since boy
hood, and he rejoiced, now, that his part
In the conduct of the Worthlngton inter
ests required him to consult the chief
counsel frequently. It chanced that It
was convenient for Jack to hold these
consultations on those very week-ends
when Grace went with Howard to the
Bannister place. They were happy week
ends; though it was not observed by the
godless gardener that Caleb Bannister
was obliged, by the consultations, to in
termit his study of the habits of plants.
In fact the gardener turned out to be the
one most concerned; he had to build an
other bench in the orchard, under an
other apple-tree.-,'

She did not answer. There was a new
tone in his voice that troubled her, a tone
of cynicism and finality. She looked. off
at the broad half moon of the bay and
shivered at the sudden chill in the air
since the sun had gone down. The sea
looked gray, with long wreaths of swirl
inp white foam where the tide was com
ing in full. There was a dull, low roar
to the breaking waves In the beach below.
There were just thirty-seven good and
excellent reasons why she should marry

and blew It in a brown veil across her
eyes and she held it back, laughing as
she looked up at him. "You may go If

He frowned and threw himself down
on the ground near the edge of tha bluff.
"I suppose that Is one reason why I

She closed her lips tightly. She would
not say another word. He could go to
Japan or the moon. It was a matter. of
tha utmost indifference to her. She turned
away from the stalwart â¢ figure on ,. tha
ground and looked off at , the storm
clouds racing up from the breast of the
sea on the horizon, her chin on her palm,
one small foot swinging to and fro ex
pressively as she reviewed tha casa of
Hugh MacDowell. â¢-- *
and the anchored yachts out in the bay
were tugging and straining like restive
horses as the swell plunged them to and
fro.
MacDowell was twenty-nine. A traveled
man of the world, with a generous for
tune back /of him, who had coma from
his globe-trotting cultured, broad-minded
and cosmopolitan, with his native Amer
ican point of view still fresh and optim
istic.
Cecil's elderly relatives dwelt lovingly
on these points. ' Her younger ones veered
to the outward and visible signs of grace
and said the tall, six foot wooer was
handsome and altogether desirable.
That was Just it. Â¦ He was too desirable.
Ha was faultless. Ever since he had
coma down to Arleigh Cecil had felt her
self lifted bodily by fate, assisted slightly
by tha anxious bevy, and thrown at his
head and heart.
Any other man in his position would
have courteously and diplomatically
avoided â¢ tha j snar*. Ha had walked into

the gift, with faithful feminine contrari

There was a sudden vivid dare that
ripped the heavy mass of clouds from
end to end. and a long- crashing peal. of
thunder like cannon. Tha sea seemed to
swell and > leap to meet the sky. Tha
boughs of the pines lashed up and down
him. Cecil knew all thirty-seven by
heart. They were rehearsed to her with
faithful exactitude by an anxious bevy
of sisters and cousins and aunts.
And there was but one reason why she
should not She did not choose to.
To Cecil tha one reason was sufficient
and outweighed all the good and excel

It was a willful and foolish obstacle set
up before one of the happiest chances
fate ever offered a girl.
Tha waves leaped and snarled with a
hissing roar at his feet like a pair of
hungry wolves, and he was forced to
stop again and again and lean back
against the bluff as the wind beat down
on .him. The burden In his arms grew
heavier with every drag&lnj? step, but at
length the beach shelved and broadened
and he staggered up the higher ground
"Put your 'arms around my neck and
keep still," he answered curtly. "We
can't stav up here."
She obeyed in silence and he made his
way down tha path. What had been a
smooth stretch of sand was now a swirl
ing mass of low breakers. MacDowcll
paused an Instant for breath as he
reached it and looked down at the face on
his shoulder. Her eves were closed. A
wild Impulse seized him and he bent and
kissed her. The next instant ha was knee
deep in tha waves, struggling In the teeth
of the gale to where the shore curved
and safety lay, and he fancied that the
arms around his neck were clasped closer
than before, although the eyes were still
closed and the face was white and still.
Ilka fragile breeze-blown ferns as tha
wind swept over them.
At the second crash Cecil rose and
turned instinctively to th* trees for shel
ter, but the gale caught her, and she
would have fallen only for MacDowell's
firm clasp of her arm. Almost Instantly
the whole world of land and sea and sky
seemed on fire, and she shrank back into
his arms with a cry of fear as a bolt
struck a kingly pine that towered above
Its brothers a few yards away and left it
a blasted, smoking ruin.
Before she could recover herself he had
lifted her In his arms and gained the
path that led down over the face of the
bluff.
"We can't get to the shore," she ex
claimed. "The tide U In."
The first soft gleam of midsummer
moonlight was castine a oath of silver
scales on the water when they reached
the hotel veranda. The soft, delicious
music of a mandolin orchestra came
through the bright lighted windows, and
they caused a moment in the shadow of
the clinging vines to look back at the sea.
"I knew you Â¦would try the fourth
time," she said laughingly, as she raised
her face to him. "Japan is so far away."

HUGH M'DOWELL'S STORMY WOOING
demanded of Harry after Inviting him out
to the barn for a talk.
"I !ove Betty and am going to marry
her," was the reply.
"You will never do It with my consent!"
"But I am cf age, father."
."Then I'll cast you off. If you marry
that girl you cease to be a son of mine,
and shall never get a cent of this prop
erty."
Harry didn't indulge in any heroics. On
the contrary he took the matter bo quiet
ly that his father chuckled to himself
and believed he had gained a victory In
the first round. He -let it be known that
he expected Harry to cease his visits to
the farmhouse, but at the same time he
was prepared to close his eyes for a time
and give the boy a chance to retire wltn
dignity. Things went on for three months
without anything further being said.
That Is, while It was said on all sides
that Harry and Betty would be married
en Thanksgiving day, the talk did not
reaeii the squire's ears until one evening
in October. He was a man who acted on
impulse. He determined to go straight
over to the widow's and settle things his
way within fifteen minutes of arriving.
The widow's bear- had no particular
grudge against the squire, but he was a
watch dog as well as a bear. He bad
been turned out that evening to roam
around and see that all was well and
when he suddenly discovered Squire Da
vis coming cross lots through the barn
yard it was only natural that he should

when he reached tha house, and the
widow added to It by allowing the bear
to follow him In and sit up before him
and growl and show his teeth. Harry had
come courting as usual, and of course the
position was embarrassing for a couple of
minutes. It might have lasted longer
but for the presence of mind of the wid
ow. She realized that the bear had dealt
her a winning hand and she proceeded lo
play it for all it was worth.
"I am very gald to see you," she said
as ehe placed a chair for the caller. "I
am the Widow Jenkins, as perhaps you
know. This young lady is my friend.

is your son Harry. The bear has intro

"Courting Betty, sir," was the reply.

"Married to that girl â never! You will

The bear reared up and growled om-
The relations between the squire and
the widow had been strained for three or
four years when two new characters came
Into the cast. A smart, good-looking girl
named Betty Lee came to lire with tha
widow, and *he hadn't been there two
*eeks when Harry' Davis saw and fell In
love v.1th her. The son had tried to stand
neutral in tbo quarrel, though naturally
leaning- toward his father's side. Perhaps
one reason why he couldn't be brought to
think altc-eether ill of the widow was on
account of her bear. She had bought the
animal of a stroller who had been taken
elck and shipped to a distant town. It
was a big black bear, full of tricks and
Food nature, and It had taken a great
liking to Harry. When the quarrel
reached a certain stage of bitterness he
had to part with the bear as well as the
widow. The separation had lasted two
years or more when Betty Lee arrived. A
month later tha young man was visiting
the widow, the girl and the bear, and
enjoying each ar.d every occasion. These
visits were unknown to the father, of
course, and he d!d not discover them un

"You must not talk so loud," cautioned
the widow. "Bumbo has got one of his

What's the matter with MIsh Lee that

"I don't want him to marry any one

"What, me marry 'em!" he shouted; but

"Yes, you will marry them," quietly re

neat, nice thing to do, and it will be a

The squire fought against it for a

bear and the . girl, aided by occasional
appeals from Harry, carried tha day, and
he stood ud- with the bear beside him

Then the bride was kissed, the bear

"Yes. At kast I care for the Ideal I

of It all.
"Youâ don'tâ meanâ it?" There were
great pauses of Incredulity between Wil
ton's words, and the slow smile that came
Into his eyes was not one of vanity, rath
er of great pleasure In an unexpected
compliment.
"Is she not the girl I have always de
scribed? Tall and slender, big brown eyes
and soft, curling, light-brown hair? You
have been blind all this time not to have
seen whom I meant. I had set my heart on
It somehow," she added sadly. "You both
seem so well suited to each other."
"Why did you not tell me sooner? I
might have set to workâ It would have
been hard work, though." He was still
looking at the bride.
"Play the part of matchmaker? And
where my little sister was concerned?
Ah, not I could not tell you. but I did
so want it."
"That Is the greatest compliment you
could have paid me. I really "
He had turned and was looking down
Into her eyes. Suddenly he stopped, as If
a thought had stifled his words, and the
color left his face for one short second.
"Come," she said, as though divining
his thought and wishing to Interrupt it.
"you are to make the first toast. I be
lieve: you must continue your duties as
best man."
She led the way down the long hall, and
together they paused on the threshold of
the dining-room.
"Did you do this?" he asked.
"Yes: do you like it?"
He stood silently drinking In the beauty
of the room, with its filmy draperies of
asparagus fern, amidst the delicate green
of which stood forth tall silver and crys
tal vases, filled with long-stemmed Bride
roses. Here and there low bowls
of. green and gold Bohemian glass war*
half buried beneath the dainty color of
the Duchesse rose, veiled In leaves of

It was very beautiful, and he said so
to her. She was very beautiful, as she
moved about in her clinging gown of pal
est green chiffon, straightening a leaf
here or bending a flower there, and his
eyes said bo, although she did not see It.
Then, the next thing he knew, the room
was filled with people, the young bride
was beside him. and some one was hold

girl where the sat poised out to wind
ward, like some spirit of thÂ« pea. her'
hair blowing In the wind, her cheeks
tglow with excitement, her eyes fixed
with a faraway look on the horizon. Vane
had never noticed how pretty she was bo
fore. He had always thought of her as a
mere child â and lo! she was a Â¦woman.
What was the thinking of? he wondered.
As if In answer to the question Mar
jorie turned ar.d mot his eyes for an In
stant and then looked away.
"You've heard of Edith's engagement?"
ehe. eaid.
"Yes," answered Vane, setting his
teeth hard, "I only found it out to-day."
"I knew It weeks ago. You thought she
cared for you?"
"Yes."
There was a quaver in the girl's voice
that made Vane look at her. She was
locking out over the yeasty water with
xr.lsty eyes and set mouth.
"All right," said .Vane after a moment's
hesitation. "I'm in a reckless mood. L*t
fate take cere of us. What will be will
be. Jump It-!"'
"What will yctir mother say?"
"She won't care. She only thinks of
Edith. If It was Edith, now. It would
be different, but I'm not such a valuable
cargo. No one will bother about me."
The words sounded rude, but Marjorie
Wir.throp knew from the Intent expres
sion on Vane's face as he gazed out on
the black clouds, the sullen green water
ef the bay ar.d the wind blown white

wonderlngly. "What can you know of

bitterly.

No man can love her as I doâ and

Ing to his sentence.
"Why did you corns out to-day in this
gale?" said Marjorie. "Is your life so
worthless to you that you would risk It
because a thoughtless woman has wound
ed you?"
"My life! What does It matter? I
don't care."
"I thought you didn't," returned the
girl, gravely. "I knew you didn't. That's
why I came. I couldn't let you come
ilone."
"And you came because you thoughtâ"
"You would be reckless? Yes."
"And you were not afraid?"
"Noâ why should I be? I knew you
would take care of meâ If not of your
self." The girl smiled at him confidently.
"I am perfectly safe with you," she
added. r "V v
So Marjorie had risked her life for him,
so that in his desperate humor he should
not go alone. But how came she. a mere
child, to understand. She. at least, had a
heart to make some man happy. And
here he was putting her life at the mercy
of the sea to gratify his selfish mood of
bitterness. Well, he must get her home
at onceâ thenâ Vane thought h* did not
much care what happened afterward.
It was blowing harder as Vane came
about and slacked the sheet for the run
to the far distant boathouse and the hotel
on the hill. They were going before the
wind now, the boat rolling dangerously

striving to hold the boat against the

thought to get her safe to land. Every
moment the wind increased, every mo

Would they make it? he wondered.
They were nearly opposite the boathouse
In those days afterward, while Marjorie
hovered between life and death, Clifford

and now knew to bo the woman In all

Edith Wlnthrop. He knew now that he

day when he was permitted to see her.
He found her on an upper piazza of thÂ«
hotel clad In a soft blue wrapper, her soft
hair loose on her shoulders, and the smile
her pale face held for him gave him hop*
that In saving her ha had found happi

when there came a sudden whirl of wind

With desperate fingers he cleared himself
and came to the surface. And Marjorteâ
where was she? Good God; had she been

For an agonized moment Vane could

HER CHOICE
4the kind of thing that people say about
a man when they are trying to find an
excuse for his existence. What people
thought about him, however, never
seemed to make John lose any sleep at
night and while Percy was permeating
the giddy social whirl he was sitting up
with his business and carefully nursing
the balance on the credit side of the
ledger.
In the course of time John married and
settled down in the shade of his own vine
and fig tree, not to mention a comfortable
account at the bank which Percy honored
with his presence about as often as once
in a while . It happened that about this
time it occurred to the aforenamed gentle
man that he was not drawing the stipend
out of the financial institution that his
elegant manners and exalted social posi
tion entitled him to and on the supposi
tion that the matter had been overlooked
by the president he decided to appropriate
a portion of the surplus of the house to
his own use. All went merry as a dinner

A Ion? and careful study of the ways of
the wicked world inclines us to the belief
that the dictum of the alleged poet on the
subject of the exceeding slnf ulness and
unattractlveness of sin should be chanced
That this statement is a true one may
be seen from a brief observation of the
case of Percy and John. Percy and John
were brothers, but otherwise unrelated.
Percy had been given that label because
It was seen from the start that he was
cast for the Percy part. As a looker he
had Apollo outside the ropes in the first
round and his clothes were sartorial son
nets. His manner -was a combination of
Beau Brummel and an experienced floor
walker, and when it came to turning out
conversation he could give a college pro
fessor the under hold and put him on the
mat two times out of three. All the
women thought he was Just too sweet
for anything, and they were about right.
In fact, Percy was the original male Gib
son girl. When he was not occupied with
his real business of life, which was to
spread Joy and gladness among the mem
bers of the opposite sex, . Percy dallied
with the ledger In a banking house and
meditated new and striking designs In
neckties.
John, on the other hand, would never
have been picked by any one not familiar
with the situation - for Percy's brother.
He was about as attractive in get up and
general appearance as a pair of care-worn
shoes and his clothes fitted him as though
he had been blown Into them by a cyclone.
The best that any one could say for him
was that he was honest and Industrious
and evidently meant well. When that sort
of a verdict Is sent In it Is a safe bet that
the miserable wretch, who receives it is
about as popular as a Tax Collector. It's
to something like the following:
Pin Is a creature ef auch charming 1 mien
That to approve It needs but to bo ieen;
And seen enough and In the proper place.
A goodly profit comes from Its embrace.
Ing teller on 120 a week and be proceeded
to Investigate the situation. As a result
of his heartless proceeding he discovered
that the bank was contributing to Percy's
support at a rate not contemplated in the
original arrangement. As a rule Percy was
not aware of John's existence more than
two or three times In the year, but when
he heard that It was up to him* to make
good or look up the time of the first train
to Montreal he fairly burned holes in the
soles of his shoes getting " over to the
place where his brother did dally battle
with the world to get the wherewithal to
pay his taxes and buy shoes for the baby.
According to the theory of strict Justice
John should have reminded Jrtm that every
tub must stand on Its own bottom, even
If the bottom may happen to get kicked
out, and then have passed him up with an
interesting tract pointing out to him that
the wages of sin is deathâ or stripes,
but we regret to state that John did noth
ing of the sort Being a simple minded
and unlettered gentleman he had probably
never heard of those fundamental busi
ness truths. Instead he put on his hat
and went back with Percy to J inform the
cold-blooded president that he was pre
pared to do the good Samaritan act to the
best of his ability. Then he extracted his
poor little balance from the bank and

"Of course, I am a very bad match for

"And It's the least I can do after break

my arm.
"Sylvia," I said, taking her bands in

"And you believed It and wrote xne
thisâ this unpardonable letter. I cam* to
tell you that I am not tngagsd to any

"Not even to me?" I pleaded.
"You deserve the 'worst punishment you

door and a moment later we recognized
my aunt's inquiry.
"Gerald," gasped Sylvia, "It's mother!

There was only one hiding place In the

Mrs. Rallton knocked and entered. I
saw her glance wander round the room
as she said blandly: "So glad you axe in.

"Sylvia!" I exclaimed in amazed tones.
"I managed to lose sight of her Just now

that perhaps she had met some one she

surmise is Incorrect. She has probably
gone home. Will yoq tee mo down to

Sho raised her eyeglasses. "What Is this?
A letter addressed to Sylvia? Shall I take

when there was a terrific crash and a
faint scream, unmistakably in Sylvia's
voice. "Sylvia!" she exclaimed In ma
jestic accents, as Sylvia emerged, dis
closing a vista of broken crockery.
"I am sorry, aunt." I said gravely,
"that Sylvia should be found In such a
compromising situation, but, after all,
there is a very good way out of It."
"Indeed!" she bowed haughtily. "You
know more of my affairs than I do my

"How dare you mention him to ma?"
she flamed out; "It is the worst taste on
your part. If I had refused you and ac

"That Is exactly what you have done."

I wanted to go out and hit somebody.
I went home and wrote Sylvia a furious

About two hours later I lit a cigarette,
mixed myself a whisky and soda and
lounged in an easy chair before the open
window. The sound of a cab approach
ing rapidly aroused me. Looking out of
my window, I saw that It contained Syl
via. As she stepped out of the cab at
my door, Iookins more bewitching even
than usual, I noticed that she carried a
letter In her hand.
Thus forewarned I answered her hur
ried knock at the door with a matter
of-fact "Come in." and evinced none of
the surprise she evidently expected me to
feel at her appearance.
"You are perfectly horrid," she began.

must bring her bonbons and flowers and
sing to her in the summer moonlight to
his mandolin. Dickey undertook these
things In a spirit of penitence and mar
tyrdom. Night after night he sat on the
porch and strove to be amiab'.e while
mentally he was fuming against John.
He sometimes wondered why nice girls
like Jessie had to have small sisters.
During the Becond week of hia en
forced reparation he made a discovery.
Belle had lengthened her dresses and
twisted her braids into a knot on top of
her small head, and with these personal
changes there had come also a touch of
coquetry to her manner that made her a
most delightful companion. He found he
was fretting less over John's advantages,
but now and then the old Jealous thoughts
would come.
"Are you not almost placated?" he
asked laughingly one night.
Belle answered with spirit, "Do you
think six boxes of choco'.ates and three
bouquets would atone for all that laugh
ter in the dress circle and those catcalls
from the gallery? No. indeed."
Dickey acknowledged that she was
right, and went on playing the agreeable.
And as he was as much phi'osopher as
martyr he set himself to get all the pleas
ure possible out of his new role. It was
really surprising how quickly time passed
in Belle's presence. Ab she swung in the
hammock with her lengthened skirts frou
frouing about her she made him tell her
all about his hopes In his profession and
never doubted but that he would achieve
his ambitions. Sometimes she talked of
Jessie and wished, with a languishing
glance Into Dickey's eyes, that she were
like her sister, "it would be so lovely to
have a man like Dickey in love with her."
He looking close to find the coveted like
ness, discovered she was very much more
beautiful than Jessie, and wondered that
he had never known It before.
After six weeks of this sort of thing
Belle sighed prettily and said she sup
posed he had spent quite enough time
and money on her to salve her hurt, and
that he had better resume his attentions
to Jessie. Of course, she would miss him,
she added with drooping lips, but she
trusted she was no usurer to claim more
than her debt Dickey went away with
an odd sense of something lost tugging
at Ills heart. The next evening he came,
intending to go into the parlor and begin
his rivalry with John; tut somehow the
lonely little figure in the hammock drew
him aside and he spent the evening as
he spent the preceding ones, In the moon
light. ; . .
"Good-by," he said Jit parting, "to
morrow I really must break Into John's
game and recover my lost ground."
She sighed and then laughed so quickly
that Dickey could scarcely separate the
two. He stood confused for a moment,
and when he recovered himself he found
that he raa still holding her hand, that
she was watching him shyly. He went
away with his brain in a whirl; in h!s
efforts to soothe her feelings had he made
the child love him? Far into the night he
pat smoking and thinking, and in the
morning the queer feeling was still in his
breast, and RlacUstone lay open but un
read before him all day. In the afternoon
as he left his office there was a commo
tion at the nearest street corner and a
runaway horse daEhed into view, drag
ging a dogcart In which sat two girlsâ
Jessie and Belle. The quick turn about
the corner sent the cart careening on one
wheel, and almost as Dickey recognized
the occupants they were spilled In the
dust. With a cry Dickey rushed forward,
and, passing one prostrate form, caught
the other In his arm with words of solicit
ous endearment. But the figure drew
resolutely away.
"This is not Jessieâ thl3 is "
But Dickey only held her the closer.
"Not Jessie, but the girl I love, the only
girl I ever really loved!. Let John take
cere of Jessie. Are you hurt, dear?"
There was a contented sigh against his
shoulder, "I haven't any pain now, not
even in my heart, which has often acheJ
at your indifference."
"John and Jessie are to be married in
the winter," she told him later.
"I'm glad of it; we'll dance at thefr
wedding" he laughed, "but. dear, I'm only
a poor young lawyer, nnd "
"And I'm ages too young- to marry, srÂ»
I'll wait a whole year for you, and If you
give up smoking and send me only one
box of chocolates a week you can save
no end of money."
And so it was arranged, and when Mies
Delaney next spoke of the lack of artistic
finish to that theatrical performance
Dickey stoutly declared the "finish was
the finest on earth," and held to his point.

the men, "it is you who are the dastard.

"In a corner a silent struggle âa

These two men were men that Alex

brother, but it was all one now. I For
there was murder In the heart of Alex

androvitch was fighting for something
more than his own life: and be was a
maniac for the instant, a wild beast. Fin
ally he drew his hand acre his brow
and turned to Anna Saratovsky. Then
he stepped back and opened a rear door.
"Anna Saratovsky," he said, "thy

"Fly, Anna Saratovsky," ha whispered
in her ear, "fly. for 'the Cyteg dea.th

It was & wild flight, that night of the
dread massacre. But at last the two had
left pursuit behind. As the day began to
break Alexandrovltch reached forth his
arm- and lifted from the ground the form.
of the fainting girl. Then with hia pre
cious burden he struck across the coun
try. He reached a small, secluded and
deserted stable. With the girl still in
his arms he entered. They crouched there
In a corner. Suddenly the girl burst ln*o
hysterical weeping. "My father and my
mother!" she exclaimed, "my father and
my mother."
Alexandrovitch comforted her. There
was a long silence between them. Sud
denly Alexandrovltch bent down his
head. "Little one." he whispered, "thou
art alone In this wide world. Thou didst
save ma once from death. My life be
longs to you, and yours to me. Let us
go through life together, little one. To
day our faith Is oneâ our creed la love."

family had gone to market at a nearby
villageâ there they would stay until the
storm had spent Its force. Anna Saratov
eky peered out at the dark spot in the
snow. Obeying a sudden impulse she rose
and ventured to the door. Then she re- i
turned.
"It is noth'rg," she assured herself.
"It is not a man. I am seeing sights
it Is the storm." Again she peered out.
"It isâ It Is a man," she exclaimed to her
self; "a man who will surely freeze to
death."
She gathered her rug elope about her.
Then with sudden energy she threw open
the little door and staggered, buffeted by
the storm, across the space of twelve
feet. It might just as well have been
twelve yards. The storm, which had de
signs upon Alexandrovitch, prevented her
from reaching him. But only for a time.
Making an extra effort she cast off the
rug that hampered her and then, with a
sudden leap, she plunged forward and
fell prone upon the dark object by the
roadside. The object stirred.
"He Is alive!" exclaimed Anna Sara
tovsky, "alive, and I must save him."
The next few moments made a woman
out of a mere girlâ the work of those few
moments was the work of a lifetime. But
she did It. Fifteen minutes later Anna
Saratovsky was rubbing with snow the
hands and face and feet of a strong
young man, who was fair to look upon,
and all the fairer because he was In the
valley of the shadow of death. At last
she was rewarded. Alexandrovltch slow
ly oDened his eyes and looked into the
face of the beautiful young girl. "You
are one of the angels up In heaven," he
murmured.
She shook her head. "I am Anna Sar
atovEky," she answered.
And all this was some years ago.
In Anna Saratovsky's village AlexanÂ»
drovitch lived and moved and had hl|
being. He was a Russian and she was a
Jewess, but to him she was one. of the
angels up in heaven.
It was early summer In the village.
One night without a sound 200 men stole
Suddenly all this was changed. In place
cf the cold, a drowsy warm'li spread
over him. He thought that he was lylnj
Â¦wrapped in furs before ttoma great !og
fire. Red flames danced before his eyes.
Alexandrovitch thought that he danced,
and laughed aloud, he felt so comfort
able. Uut he did not. He was simply
Btagperlr.g through the deep snow. h!s
head lolling from side to side and his
dark eyes staring at vacancy. Finally he
pitched headforemost.
"Ah," muttered AlexandrovUch to him
self pleasantly, "this is Indeed a be.J of
down. Now shall I sleep, and Bleep and
eleep."
And Alexandrovlteh slept. And the bliz
zard roared about him. It was a strange
thing that but twelve feet to the right
of Alexandrovitch there was a email cot
tage, almost covered with the snow. In
eide was a young giri â the daughter of
Abram Saratoveky. Baratovskv was a
Jewâ a Russian Jew. There was but one
window to this eottajre. and In this win
dow sat the young girl closely wrapped
up In a rug. for the cold entered and the
snow drifted In through the pan? of glass.

Hank dropped by my office for a minute. on his way to 'Frisco.
'Said he liked things lively, but there was altogether too much rough
'house on Beacon Hill for him. Judged that as the crowd which wasn't
.invited was so blamed sociable, the one which was invited would
have stayed for a week if it hadn't slipped up on the date. That might
be the Boston idea, but he wanted a little more refinement in his.
Said he was a pretty free spender and would hold his end up, but he
hated a hog. Of course I told Hank that Boston wasn't all that it
was cracked up to be in the school histories, and that Circle City was
not so tough as it read in the newspapers, for there was no way of
making him understand that he might have lived in Boston for a
hundred years without being invited to a strawberry sociable. Be
cause a fellow cuts ice on the Arctic Circle it: doesn't follow that he's
going to be worth beans on the Back Bay.

While this was going on the Mayflower descendant was telephon
ing for the police from one side and the Signer's great-grandson from
the other, and just as tr-e crowd yelled and broke for the house two
patrol wagons full of policemen got there. But they had to turn in
s riot call and bring out the reserves before they could break up
Hank's little Boston tea-party.
After all Hank did what he started out to do with his party â
rounded up all his neighbors in a bunch, though not exactly according
to schedule. For next morning there were so many descendants and
grent-graiidsons in the police court to prefer charges that it looked
like a reunion of the Pilgrim Fathers. The Judge fined Hanks on
sixteen counts and bound him over to keep the peace for a hundred
years. That afternoon he left for the West on a special, because the
limited didn't get there quick enough. But before going he tacked on
the front door of his house a sign which read:
"Neighbors paying their party calls will please not heave rocks
through windows to attract attention. Not in and not going to be.

WHEN GOOD MEN GO WRONG

(Copyright, 1903, Sampson-Hodges Co., Chicago.)
, After the excitement had died down so we could get a chance to
talk about it I went to Orrin and told him I was sorry he'd lost He
scratched his head a while and then looked at me kind of sorrowful
and said:
"I don't know just how I'm goin* to raise the money to pay it
back to the man I borrowed it from, and I was a blamed fool to bet,
anyway, because I can't afford to lose so much; but that ain't what's
bothering me the most Dave hadn't any right to win that race. His
mare ain't got anyÂ»thoroughbred blood into her, and he didn't drive
right. Darn it, Jeff, it ain't logical. That's what I'm lookin* at."
So you can't always tell about these things. Fish and Starr and
them people may have it all figgered out accordin' to logic, but logic
like the knot the preacher ties. It doesn't always hold. Logic's the
same as clothes. The styles keep chlngin* right along. Every little
while some captain of industry gets up and tells the people not to
fret because it's the logic of events that's bringin* the combines, and
that we ought to quit complainin" about it. Yours for logic.
"I know it," says he. "I have thought of them, but Orrin's goin*
into it with his eyes open. He knows all about it. I haven't kept
anything from him. So I don't see where there would be any dis
grace agin my fambly."
So the race come off. They got an even start and away they went
Orrin had seen two 0/ three big races and knew the tricks of tha
track. He let Dave get a little ahead at the start and then hung onto
his wheel. They went around the track that way the first time and
Orrin looked at the crowd in the grand stand as they were goin* past
on the last round and kind of smiled. I felt sorry for Dave because
I had a morgidge on his place at the time and I knew he couldn't
afford to lose the money, with the interest due in about three weeks.
Along tords the home stretch we seen Orrin lean forward and be
gin to let his horse out, but somehow he didn't seem to gain very fast
Then pretty soon he commenced to use the whip, and still Dave's
blamed old plug kept goin' right along in front, and almost before
anybody realized what had happened they went under the wire with
Orrin about four lengths farther back than he was when he began to
let his horse loose.
imake smoke, refuse to abolish grade crossin's and do the other legiti
imate business that comes in the line of railroadin'.
This talk about puttin* the railroads in the hands of the uot
?ernment is all foolish. That wouldn't be logic. You can't do things
I in this world that ain't logical. It's just as Professor Starr sayi, only
I 1 don't like the cold-blooded way he talks. Some of the big tellers
1 have eot to eat the little ones to keep them from gettra' in the way.
It's the natchural law of supply and demand. The big ones do the
'demandin' and the little chaps bring on the supply. There you have
'the whole thing worked out logical. I know it's logical, because the
masses don't seem to like it ââ..,. â¢ i_
Of course, reasonin' the thing out on Mr. Fish s plan, we might
say that the toothe acke's logical because the masses don't like it,
but as Judge Miller says, that would be beginnin' the question. I
can't help agreein' to the broad principle laid down by the Chicago
professor that it's all right for men to eat one another, only there'i
some details about the plan that there's goin' to be a good deal of
trouble in workin' out. It looks as though it wouldn't be any more
than reasonable to s'pose the lean people ought to have the right to
eat the fat ones,' but the dickens of it is that the fat ones generly are
the strongest, so they mightn's give their free will and consent.
Then you'd have a situation that wasn't logical. It would be like the
time when Orrin Hitchcoclc' and Dave Martin matched their horses
for a 'ace, one fall, at the county fair. Orrin had a horse that was nearly
two-thirds thoroughbred and Dave's mare was just a common sort
cf a plug that he'd raised himself, and he didn't know much more
about horses than they say an ordinary Justice of the Peace knows
about law. Orrin borrowed fifty dollars to put up on the match and
there was a big crowd out to see the race. Dave came to me before
the match took place and says: .
"Jeff," says he, "I've always tried to live a good Christian life,
and I don't want to wrong my fellow man just for the sake of win
nin' fifty dollars'. Do you think it's right for me to go into this
thing?"
"Well," says I, "I can't very well give other people advice on
these things, but if I was in your place I wouldn't do it. You're a
husband and a father. You've got to think of your wife and chil
dren." -v.

THE, ORACLE: OF MULBERRY CENTER
I ULBERRY CENTER, Sept. 24.â I see there's a
I Chicago professor that says a man has a right to
'^^^^^or n^ eat s * e^ ow man when they ain't nothin' else
I â¢_ Jlaf'.*: jffl^* W around, that's worth grubbin' up. I don't know
I whether he's goin' on the theory that human
l fl esn is about the cheapest article in the market
,0S/ I I VoV, tnese days or whether he just has a natchural
I taste for good society, but anyway I s'pose there's
a logic in what he says. Big fish eat Itp little fish, so it's only reason
'able to think the good Lord in his all-seein' wisdom intended the big
'men of this world to eat up the little chaps.
1 Mr. Rockyfeller has been at it a good many years and seems to be
'thrivin' on^it, so this professor in his collidge probably knew what he
1 was talkin' about before he spoke. Speakin' of fish makes me think
,of Stuyvesant. Stive is an expert on the gobblin' up .business, and'
,accordin' to the papers he sides in with the professor. Stuyvesant 1
don't use quite the same figger of speech, bein' more used to select so-,
ciety. Instead of comin' right out cold-blooded and sayin' it's right for
,men to eat up one another, he's a little more refined about it and says 1
it's all right for a few railroads to gobble up all the rest. I seen a
report about it the other day, and as I disremember it, he says there's
'about two hundred railroad companies in the country now that's got
to get et up by about fifteen of the big ones.
1 "It's the natcheral law of give and take," he says. "You can't
,make water run uphill, so it shows that the railroad business has to
be "done by a few companies. The rolling stone gathers no moss,
which only goes to prove that it's foolish for the big roads not to
force the little ones to. come in and git swallowed up. Too many
cooks spoil the broth, which makes it as plain as day that a railroad
company with only four hundred and seven miles of track and not
a millionaire among its directors hasn't enny moral or logical right
to do business. It's a long lane that has no turnin", and this shows
that the railroads of this country have got to belong to Rockyfeller.
the Vanderbilts, George Gould, Jim Hill, Pierp, me and three or four
more of us boys that got sent here by the Supreme Being to fix rates.
i Indeed, the surprise and sorrow which we feel when a good man
goes astray testify to our innate recognition of the rights and claims
of virtue. In his latest and in some respects his most absorbing
'story â "The Mettle of the Pasture" â James Lane Allen has delineated
'with wonderful acuteness the shrinking and the repulsion of a pure,
ihigh-minded woman before the sudden revelation of a moral strain
|in one whom she had previously regarded as the best of men. No.
we are not to condone the lapse from virtue on the part of professedly
good men and true. Their sin is greater than that of the man who
'never made any profession of goodness. I, for one, rejoice that the
iworld holds religious people accountable to a higher standard of
virtue than may be current in the community. The constant scrutiny
of, their fellow-men is something that Christians ought to be grateful
for instead of trying to escape it or complaining because of the criti
cisms of their neighbors.
But let us not forget that where one church treasurer steals a
hundred, yes a thousand â many of them with exceptional opportuni
ties for pilferingâ are as honest as the sun. Where one minister mis
behaves, a thousand live clean and 'helpful lives. And goodness it
self â the real, thing, I mean, not its counterfeit â never goes wrong.
It will always stand the light of day. Therefore with all thy gettings,
my dear friend, get goodness and get more goodness day by day.
And never think that a modest, sensible profession of a desire and
purpose to be good makes it harder to achieve the rear thing.; ;It
makes it a good deal easier. When you ally yourself with forces that
make for righteousness ' in the community, , when, you publicly
acknowledge that you want to be counted -. in with the people who
cherish and pursue the highest ideals, you gain the added strength
that come* from fellowship and from a manly, clean-cut, personal de
cision. Â¦ â¢' â¢Â¦'Â¦â¢â¢ â¢Â¦-,Â¦

"*"Â» ?aÂ£Sfv>/r'jl headlines as these in the newspapers not only pro
~^ m^T an unpleasant shock upon us, but give rise
I 1 â Jjajjg==. to serious questions and misgivings. That is the
worst result of the wrongdoing of the presum-
ably righteous man. It not only clouds and
perhaps wrecks his own future and brings dishonor and shame upon
his family, but it strikes at the foundation of virtue in the community
and lessens the common stock of faith and confidence.' When Deacon
Jones embezzles the money of his church, when Parson Smith runs
off with another man's wife, people begin to ask if there is any such
thing as honor and decency, anyway. %
Now it 'is well to remember, in the first place, that the wise and
just ruler of this universe does not stake his continuance of virtue in
this world and its ultimate triumph over vice on any one man or any
,ten men. The righteous government and ordering of this universe
goes on even if the respectable men in Sodom are reduced, to five or
even to one. Once in historyâ so some of us thinkâ God did risk
'a great deal upon the earthly career of a well-beloved. Son,, whose
i perfect life has for nineteen centuries illustrated the moral possibili
ities ot a human soul. If he had deviated a hair's breadth fromrec

Hank sent out a thousand invitations to his grand opening, as he
called it; Wt one at every house within a mile. Had a brass band on
the front steps and fireworks on the roof. Ordered forty kegs from
the brewery and hired a fancy mixer to sling together mild snorts as
he called them, for the ladies. They tell me that when the band got
to going good on the steps and the fireworks on the roof even Beacon
street looked out the windows to see what was^oing. There must
have been ten thousand people in the street and not a soul but Hank
and his wife and the mixer in the house. Some one yelled speech, and
then the whole crowd took it up, till Hank came out on the steps. He
shut off the band with one hand and stopped the fireworks with the
other. Said that speech-making was not his strangle-hold; that he'd
been living on snowballs in the Klondike for so long that his gas
pipe was frozen; but that this welcome started the ice and he thought
about three fingers of the plumber's favorite prescription would cut
out the frost. Would the crowd join him? He had invited a few
friends in for the evening, but there seemed to be some misunderstand
ing about the date, and he hated to have the good stuff curdle on
his hands. ' . . . Â¦

heard of him off and on as tending store a little, and farming a little,
and loafing a Rood deal. Then I forgot all about him until one dai a
few years ago when he turned up in the papers as Captain Henry Smith,
the Klondike Gold King, just back from Circle City, with a million in
dust and anything you pleise in claims. There's never any limit to
what a miner <rr.ay be worth in those, except his imagination.

I've got a pretty good memory of faces, and I'd bought too much
store plug of Hank in my time not to know him. even with a clean
shave and a plug hat. Some men dry up with success, but it was just
spouting out of Hank. Told me he had made his pile and that he
was tired of living on the slag heap; that he'd spent his whole life
where money hardly whispered. let alone talked, and he was going
now where it would shout. Wanted to know what was the use of
being a nob if a fellow wasn't the nobbiest sort of a, nob. Said he'd
bought a house on Beacon Hill, in Boston, and that if I'd prick up
my ears occasionally I'd hear something drop into the Back â¢ Bay.

I didn't explain to Hank, because it was congratulations and not
explanations that he wanted, and I make it a point to show a customer
the line of goods that he's looking for. And I never heard the full
particulars of his experiences in the East, though, from what I learned
afterward. Hank struck Boston with a bang," all" right.
He located his claim on Beacon Hill, between a Mayflower de

lieve that when the Lord made them be was through, and that the rest
of us just happened And hÂ« hadn't been in town two hours before
he started in to make improvements. There Was a high wrought-iron
railing in front of his house, and he had that gilded first thing, be
cause, as he said, he wasn't running a receiving vault and he didn't
want any mistakes. Then he bought a nice open barouche, had the
wheels painted red, hired a nigger coachman and started out in style
to be sociable and get acquainted. Left his card all the way down one
side of Beacon street, and then drove back leaving it on the other.
Everywhere he stopped he found that the whole family was out. Kept
it up a week, on and off, but didn't seem to have any luck. Thought
that the men must be hot sports and the women great gadders to keep
on the jump so much. Allowed that they were the liveliest little lot
of fleas that he h2d ever chased. Decided to quit trying to nail 'cm

called for their usual dally interview with
the famous leader of the sto--k market.
There were two United States Senators,
an ex-Congressman, a score of men who
had inherited fortunes and were doubling
them in the stock market, thre* or four
gray-haired, shrewd-faced capitalists,
whose names appeared many times in the
financial pages of newspapers; a baker's
dozen of prominent municipal politicians,
a well-known Western railroad president,
with a ruddy face and a snow-white
beard; two famous physicians, the vice
president of a life insurance company, a
half score of wholesale merchants and a
low-voiced. Insignificant little man with
a quiet, almost apologetio look, who sel
dom spoke and never smiled, but who.
next to tht colonel himself, wu beyond
question the heaviest plunger in the office.
The colonel came out of hla office to go
to his brother's room, where, seated about
a long polished table, were several direct

a tow Tolce, "Got. your stock yet?" .
The customers in the corridor, men who
by the colonel's advice were "carrying'*
from BOO to 10,000 shares each of Eastoa
and Allentown, leaned forward eagerly.
All were men who north of Wall street
would not have stooped to listen to oth
ers' conversations tf their lives depended
on it. In a broker's office such notions
were absurd, almost wicked. Certainly
at that moment twenty pairs of eyeÂ» were
looking fixedly at the great leader of thm
stock market and the young clerk.
The colonel felt thia Intuitively. Ha
confirmed It with a quick glance of hia>
sharp little eyes. He had not sold all hlsi

loth to believe well of any stock operator,
used to comment eneertagty on the fact
that the world heard ; much about tha
"Treadwell buying," but never - s> word
about the "TreadweU selling."
If the colonel gave a bint to the cus
tomers there would be aa avalanche of
selling orders that would make the prtos>
of the stock break sharply, and this
would not benefit any one. He had ad
vised them to buy the stock at 80 and 88

hope of making more, It was their cwa

"There Is no use of being a blamed

emphasis, "but where in bla2es is 'the
sense of throwing away that much money
by selling out too soon? Limit your
losses and let your profits run."
The young man went into the office of
Treadwell & Co. on the eleventh day. Ha

Then. Wilson, who knew his brother

The colonel took chances. Out of on*
corner of his mouth, so that he did not
even turn his head toward the boy and
so that the watching customers could
not suspect what he was doing, he saot
a quick whisperâ a lobslded, but phllan
thopic affairâ at him: "Look at the color
of your money, boy! Take your profits
and say nothing!" And he walked Into
the room where the Suburban Trolley
magnates awaited him Impatiently.
Carey, thrilled but taciturn, gave his
Order to sell his Easton and Allentown,
unsuspected by the mob. They sold it for
him at 105 1 '%. Deducing commissions and
interest charges the colonel's whisper had
put $1050 in the young clerk's pocket.

The boy had a pleasant smile, the
colonel thought.
"I have saved up some money, colonel."
"Keep it. That's the best advice I can
give you. Go away instantly. Great Scot!
youngster, you are In Wall street now."
"On, I â I'm safe enough In this office, 1
guess," retorted Carey.
The famous leader of the stock market
looked at him solemnly. The boy re
turned the look imperturbably. Then
Colonel Treadwell laughed, and Carey
laughed back at him.
"What are you doing to keep out of
State prison?" asked Treadwell.
"I'm a clerk in the office of the Federal
Pump Company, third floor, upstairs. I
have saved some money and I want to
.know what to do with it. I read an ar
ticle in the Sun the other day. It said
you had advised people to put their sav
ings into Suburban Trolley, and how well
they had fared."
"That was a year ago. Trolley has gone
up fifty points since then."
"That shows how good the advice
was. And you also said a young man
should do something with his savings and
not let them lie idle." . : '. ,'J< >s
The young man looked straight Into the
little, twinkling, kindly eyes of the leader
of the stock market.
"How much money have you?"
"I have $210," replied the lad, with an
uncertain smile. He felt proud of the
magnitude of his savings in his own
room; in this office he felt a bit ashamed
of their insignificance.
"Dear me," said tne millionaire specu
lator, very seriously, "that's a good deal
of money. It's a blamed sight more than
I had when I started in business. Got it
with you?"
"Yes, sir."
"Well, I'll Introduce you to my brother
Wilson, who has charge of our customers.
Come in, John." .
"John" came right in. His other name
was Mellen. He was a slim, quLet-Iooklng
man of about flve-and-fifty. His enemies
said that he had made $1,000,000 for every
year he had lived and had kept it. '
"Sit down, John." said Colonel Tread
well. shaking hands with Mr. Mel!en,. # TU

At the door he shoo * hands with two
more Â¦visitorsâ a tall, ruddy-raced, white-

those stocks advance with which he was
identified, and that, of course, the pub
lic always follows tht nocks that are
made active, and many other explana
tions. But In the end Wall street carni
to realize exactly to what It was that the
blind devotion of the speculative pcbllo
for the colonel was due. Defying all tra
ditions, upsetting all precedents, violating
all rules, driving all the "veterans" to
the verge of hysterics and bankruptcy by
his dally defiance of accepted views as to
the art of operating In stocks, Colonel
Josiah T. Treadwell founded a new
school: He told the truth.
The colonel sat In his oSice alone with
his thoughts. The door was open â It was
always openâ end the clerks and custom
ers of Treadwell & Co.. aa they passed to
and fro. caught glimpses of the great lead
er's broad, kindly face and shrewd, 'lUtle,
twinkling eyes that seemed to smile at
them. They wondered what new "deal"
the colonel was planning. And then they
â¢rtshed with all their souls and purses
they knew the name of the stockâmere
ly the name of Itâ -co that they might
"get In on the ground floor."
The famous operator sat on a revolv
ing chair by his desk. He had turned his
back on as accumulation of correspond
ence, end he now rotated from right to
left and from left to richt. The tips of
his shoesâ he was a short manâ missed
the floor by an inch or two, and he
ewung his feet contentedly. A ticker
whirred away blithely, and from time to
time Treadwell ceased his rocking and his
foot-swlnglng and glanced Jovially at the
ticker tape. From his window he could
eee a Mississippi of people or a bit of New
York summer sky, but his restless eyes
were roaming and skipping from place to
place. And the clerks and the customers
wondered whether the market was going
the way the colonel had planned. The
ticker â¢was whirring and clicking, impas
sively, and the colonel wore a meditative
look. What was the "old man" schem
ing? The bears had better be en their
guard! As a matter of Tact, Josiah T.
Tr^adwell was thinking that his brother
Wilson, who had left him a few minutes
before, was certainly growing bold. He
aJso wondered whether people who adver
tised "restorers" and "invigorators" were
.veracious or merely "Wall Streety," as he
put it to himself.
A young man, an utter stranger to Col
onel Treadwell. halted at his door and
looked at the leader of the stock market
hesitatingly.
"Come in. com'* in," called out the col
onel, cheerily. "Won't you walk into my
parlor?"
"Good morning. Colonel Tread well," eald
the lad.- diffidently.
"Who are you. and what aro you, and
what can I do for you?" said the colonel,
extending his hand.
The youth did not heed the chubby, out-
Ftretched hand. "My name," he said, very
formally and introductory, "is Carey.
My father used to know you when he was
editor of the B'.ankburg Herald."
"Well," said the colonel, encouragingly,
"shake hards, anyhow."
Carey shook hands: his diffidence van
ished. He was a pleasant-faced, pleasant
voiced young fellow, Treadwell thought.
He was a good-hearted. Jocular old fel
low, unlike what he had Imagined the
leader, of the stock market would be,
Care y*" thought.
"Yes,** went on the colonel, "I remem
ber your father very well. I never forget
my up-the-State friends, and I am al
ways glad to see their sons. When I ran
for Congress Bill Carey wrot<Â» red-hot
editorials in my favor, and I was beaten
by a large and enthusiastic majority. I
haven't seen your father in twenty -odd
yearsâ not since he went wrong and took
to politics." . .
"Well, Colonel Treadwell," laughed
Carey. "I guess dad did his best for you.
And if you didn't go to Congress you're
better off, from all I read in the papers
about you"
You would havÂ« thought they had
known each other for years.
"That's what I sty; I have to," chuck
ling.
"Colonel," said tht young man boldly,
â¢Tve come to ask your advice."
"Most people don't ask it twice. Be

ners; leaders to whom the stock market
was only the Monte Carlo of the tape,
and leaders to whom It was a means to

leaders; leaders who were church pillars

The man who. thinks a little woman la
made for nothing but to be loved and
petted often wakes up to find her like
her 'prototype, the kittenâ mighty sweet,
and .'soft and playful, but under the soft
purr are hidden tiny daws, and the kitten
uses, them if -rubbed the .wrong way
.The consequence is that she often takes
offense and notices trifles not Intended,
but which she resents, and then like a
bantam rooster she wants to fight any
thing in sight, irrespective . of size ' and
weight. .
She is really not as' amiable as one
larger, because on the same principle of
little things she notices trifles and is irri
tated. Then* she conceives an Idea that
because she Is little she is being Imposed
upon.
The woman who really loves fears to
lose a love she prizes, and for that reason
love can make no demand of her to which
her, heart will not respond.
. The little woman Is more aggressive
though* in this regard than her big sif
ter. In fact she is spoiled, and will have
her own way if startled by the crack of
doom.

A woman must either be ruled, or she

she finds it sweet, and submits gracefully.
The greater her ibve, the more will it "be
her pleasure to yield to that love, j A^t
The modernized* idea- that- Â¦ a woman
should not .only- obey- does not appeal to
love itself." When.it comes to "discussing
or wrangling over, .that question there is
little love at the bottom of it. .

/A large woman would hardly fit into the

â¢However," when it - comes - to \ a "test i of

the little woman -is apt to discover an Im
mense amount of force. She is rarely a
coward, and , the instinct- of fear is less
developed in her than in her larger sisteiK
She is something of a fighter too, and
full of pluck, until It is often both amus
ing 'Â¦ and amazing to . find what â¢ a lot of
self, her mouth as pouting and enticing
as the rosebud lips of a child, and yet,
beyond and behind it all, the wee maiden
has often a will of iron that is proof <
against pleadings and threats.. >
Little people are notoriously Â¦ stubborn,

and yet . I j might make Â¦ another; exception,"
the tinier the woman, the bigger the man

However, thÂ« dainty little maid has; it
pretty much her own way while she is
young and charming. Men speak.Vjf her
as such a "dear little thine." or "such a
pretty little thing," in a. tone that almost
carries with It a caress. While it would
be tantamount to an insult to say of her

He would never -have '.the' courage to face

The little . woman - has ah immense ad
vantage over the large one in her sunny
youth. Men entertain a more chivalrous
sentiment toward the tiny maid, whom
they, seem to think i.t a bounden duty to
look after, and toward whom to exercise
a sort of protecting espionage.
The larger girl, they fancy, can take
care of herself, while the wee mite of
femininity needs a man's strong right
arm.
elderly, stately matrons suffers through
comparison. Besides, the little woman
rarely masters the art of growing -, old
gracefully.
The dainty girl, petite and charming
herself, runs to little things of her own
prototype. Dainty belongings, dainty
surroundings, that harmonize with her
own personality, are adopted by her and
anything other than In keeping irritates
her, and as old women say, "Gets on her
nerve*."
The tastes and environments of a large
woman run into more generous channels.
She Is not apt to notice little things with
the same precision or analytical spirit
as does the wee maiden. She sees life
through a larger prospective, and her
character partakes of her physical self.
The dainty maid seeks harmony in her
surroundings and an absence of It strikes
a discordant note that mars the whole
melody of her life.
She notices many things that her more
generously proportioned sisters would
Bcver think of, and allows the little things
of life to fret and annoy her in a manner
that her physical opposite escapes.
For this reason you rarely find a little
old woman who retains even a remote
semblance of her girlish beauty. The little
old woman shows in her wizened face,
with its lace work of wrinkles, how she
has fretted and nursed her grievances un
til through them she has woven her net
work of wrinkles during all the years
that Time has kept tabs on her.
Large women, in the majority of cases,
grow into handsome old ladies. The pass
ing years deal kindly with them, and
many who were hardly passable In youth
take on a beauty with the friendly mark
lags of age that astonishes even them
selves.
The dainty little woman shrinks into a
shriveled little dame, with an almost un
canny, selfish look, and the proportion of
pretty little old women with handsome,
:.s she looks, and has a penchant
for pretty things that form the back
ground of the picture,. or is in the nature
of a frame work of the little miniature.

About one question of that kind and she'd

PREFERENTIAL
TARIFFS
The question of preferential tariffs for
imperial purposes between the United
Kingdom and her Colonies must natu
rally resolve itself, if and when it takes
concrete and practical shape, into a sep
arate business transaction between the
mother country and each particular col
ony, in which the natural resources and
particular products of the colony, the
amount of those products available for
export, the geographical position of the
colony and its distance from our shores,
and the nature and amount of goods
likely to be required from the mother
country, will all have to be consid
ered and taken into account. Let us im
agine John'Uull in a position to say to each full grown, responsible, self-gov
erning member of his imperial family. '"If I give you a preference on this im
port or that, what will you give me in return?" And so when terms and
rates of preference are finally adjusted on the quid pro quo principle, the bar
gain might be struck. .
So much as regards the inside transaction between members ot the
same great British family. As between the family and the outside world,
the contemplated bargain also obviously involves the principle of reciprocal
tariffs against a possible common commercial enemy. For practical pur
poses the United Kingdom must be able to tax foreign imports, even other
than those on which colonial preference may be given, in defense of her
family as well as of herself.
Let us briefly consider on these lines the case of Canada and the United
States. Three thousand miles of ocean divide the United Kingdom from her
greatest colony, the Dominion of Canada, as well as from that great inde
pendent republic, the United States, which might to-day have been a self
governing British colony of the first magnitude had our statesmen of a hun
dred and twenty years ago been wiser and more far-sighted.
Geography and Commercial Relations.
What then are the present commercial relations between England and
the North American continent, and what particular considerations do they
involve if preferential trade regions are to be established between England
and Canada? It is clear that the geography of the case alone compels us to
bring the United States into the. discussion, for this reason if for no other,
that our colony and the great republic march together for some three thou
sand miles. Apart from this particular geographical reason the consideration
of this question becomes all the more practical and even urgent when it. is
remembered that Canada has recently given us a 33 i"3 per cent tariff prefer
ence for which, under our present fiscal system, we can give no return; that
Germanv has in consequence threatened to retaliate on Canada with increased
hostile tariffs with the avowed intention not only of punishing Canada^ but
also of deterring other British colonies from following her example; and that,
in consequence, no doubt, of our present inability to respond to her advances,
Canada has recently commenced negotiations for a reciprocity treaty with her
powerful and prosperous neighbor, the United States; negotiations which
are reported to have ceased since Mr. Chamberlain made his historic speech
at Birmingham. Let us take it that Canada is holding her hand in the hopes
that the mother country may after all be able to meet her advances. Now for
a brief outline of the salient facts. Our trade with Canada amounts in
round figures to Â£30,000,000, or three times what it was forty years ago. She
is a young country with an immense area and a comparatively sparse popu
lation of about 6,000,000. Her agricultural and industrial development is
capable of enormous expansion: and if her population was relatively as dense
as Norway, the most thinly populated of European countries, it would
amount not to 6.000,000 but to 60.000,000 or ten times its present number. It
is therefore perfectly clear that Canada is worth looking after and that her
trade with us is well worth encouraging and developing from every point of
view. Her exports to us are mainly agricultural products and timber, her
imports from us mainly manufactured goods. As a sample of her latent pos
sibilities Canada is stated on good authority to possess at least 150,000,000
acres of untouched virgin wheat land capable of producing fifteen bushels per
acre or more. Her present cultivated area is 4.000,000 acres, which in 1901
produced 64,000,000 bushels of wheat besides other cereals.
The United tStaftes and Canada.
How about her powerful neighbor across the international line? With
a population of over 70,000,000 on a somewhat similar sized area the United
States possesses a far greater variety of soil and climate; better developed
railway and inland water transport and a much longer available coast line
with numerous ice-free ports as against the few Canadian Atlantic ports,
which, with the exception of Halifax and St. John, are only ice free for a
little more than half the year. England's yearly trade . with the United
States is something under Â£200,000.000, of which the larger and increasing por
tion consists of imports to the United Kingdom, the smaller and decreasing
portion of manufactured exports from the United Kingdom. Among other
items half the breadstuffs consumed in the British Isles in 1002 were sup
plied by the United States. On this point it may be remarked that a reason
able import duty on American wheat, with a free British market for Cana-
dian wheat, would in all probability and in less than a generation hence
transfer England's granary from the States, a foreign country, to our great
est colony, Canada, and thus secure for all time the inestimable advantage
and security of a national food supply within the boundaries of our own em
pire, and this could be brought about without, it is believed; any serious or
even appreciable rise in the price of bread to the British consumer. JJnder
present conditions it is difficult to estimate what price bread might not rise
to in the British Isles in the â let "us hope highly improbableâ event of war
with the United States. But highly improbable events have a knack of
sometimes occurring, and the above is an instance of how our present depen
dence on foreign countries for our daily bread might eventually be done away
with and a great national danger insured against as a result of preferential
tariffs with the minimu^ii of inconvenience to the British consumer.
Canada's Fiscal Position.
Â¦ .. . Â¦ Â¦
But let us look at the above facts from Canada's point of view. She has
at present much to gain and nothing â commercially â to lose by a recip
rocity treaty with the United States. Our present so-called free trade princi
ples prevent us from even negotiating with her on preferential . tariff lines.
There is an American import duty, for example, of 8 shillings a quarter on
Canadian wheat. , The Canadian" farmer is thus to all intents and purposes an
outsider debarred from the free grain market and the splendidly developed
storage and transport system of the United States. A reciprocity treaty
might open the door to the Canadian farmer to the advantage at all events of
his pocket. Only his loyalty to the mother country stands in the way. But
loyalty, like 'other sentiment!, must have at times something substantial to
feed upon, and this would be supplied by a preferential British tariff in favor
of Canadian grain. On the other hand a reciprocity treaty with the United
States probably means the ultimate annexation of Canada by that country
and the disappearance of the British flag from the New World. Lelus face
the possibilities frankly and fully. Canada's material and commercial in
terests apparently demand one of two things, either reciprocity with her great
territorial neighbor and all its consequences, including protection against
Germany's hostile, tariff s' and a possible change of flag, or preferential tariffs
with the mother country and similar protection at her hands against outside
commercial war. Â» '
Against all these possibilities and considerations the opponents of- Mr.
Chamberlain's policy of inquiry, for at present it is nothing more than this,
have nothing but a blind and so far unreasoned appeal to an ancient policy
of free imports, which thev tell us made England great. Is this policy in
deed the cause of England's greatness? It is. not proposed to attempt any
detailed reply to this question here, but it is one that must be definitely an
swered before the controversy can be closed. -
â¢ Time Is Agamst^Free Trade.
Â¦ Let it suffice to point out that we live in a world- of change and that all
the conditions of fifty years ago, on which the apostles of free trade took
their stand, have absolutely disappeared. Not only are Cobden's promise*
hopelessly out of date, but all his prophecies>have been falsified and his argu
ments proved unsound by subsequent history. Our wheat'area has decreased
by more than one-half; we live largely on imported necessaries; no country
in the world has followed our free trade example, and highly protective
countries, like America and Germany, for example; presume to thrive and to
increase their commercial and industrial prosperity in spite of Cobdenitc
prophecies to the contrary. Our commercial supremacy is in fact already
taken from us. Many of our.home industries have been killed and some are
now dving or eking out a miserable, starved existence in consequence of high
tariffs "abroad and the swamping of the home markets by foreign goods that
are sold here below cost. It may be strongly urged that the onus of explain
ing away all these prophetic failures now lies on the shoulders of Cobden's
followers and the free trade school generally. '
Spaco will not here permit the consideration of possible , retaliatory tar
iffs, for her own protection, by Great Britain against the United States and
apart from Canada. But it must be borne in mind that this is part and par
cel of the same inquiry. Our great and increasing dependence on the United
States for breadstuffs and other necessaries of life has already been referred
to. Her command of the iron and steel trade, the effect of her hostile tariffs
en our production of glass and machinery, her almost absolute control of our
raw cotton supplies, on which at least .3,000,000 of our population depend for
a livelihood, and her increasingly active competition in all the neutral mar
kets of the world are further instances of her growing and aggressive influence
on our trades and manufactures.
Power, Trade arad Population.
Under all these circumstances do the free trade arguments of fifty years
ago still apply to the greatly changed conditions of to-day, or would we do
well to arm ourselves, to a certain extent at all events, like our comp'etitors,
and thus enter the commercial arena of the world along with them on some
thing like equal terms? These are the questions that require to be faced
and answered. TheBoard of Trade has issued a blue book, dated May, IQ02,
containing comparative statistics of the population, industry and commerce
of the United Kingdom and some leading : foreign countries, . including the
United States. These statistics are startling and instructive, fit is. however,
sufficient for our presenVpurpose to quote^in^ conclusion the following few
sentences from the summary of this carefully, prepared memorandum as an
apt and fitting comment on the situation: "The increase of population in
Germany and the United States." says the memorandum, "has recently been
greater than the increase in the-United Kingdom, and these _ countries have
rapidly developed manufacturing and industrial power. , As with ourselves so
with these countries/the set of population has been to the towns; necessarily
therefore there has been a more vigorous search than formerly for an outlet
for the power above referred to. * * * Their competition with us in neu
tral markets, and even in our home markets, will probably, unless we our
sches are active, become increasingly serious. Every year will add to their
acquired capital and skill, and they will have. larger and larger additions to
their populations to draw upon. It is necessary, therefore, more than ever,
that the change of conditions should be recognized, and we can scarcely ex
pect tV maintain our past undoubted pre-eminence at any rate without stren
uous effort. * * * The problem how this best can be done is of vital
interest to all classes of the industrial and commercial community."

â¢ These quaint words of Thomas Car

dress of George H. Maxwell, executive
chairman of the National Irrigation As

Mr. Maxwell planted his argument on

stop the congestion of our population
in cities and turn the tide back to the

carrying to its full fruition the great new national policy embodied in the na
tional irrigation act. In places which must otherwise remain waste and des
olate national irrigation will create homes on the land for countless millions
who would otherwise be homeless.

He made no criticism of our Philippine policy, but he asked the con
gress which was the greater national victory: -
To accomplish what we have done in the Philippines or to conquer
from the deserts a territory within our own borders capable of sustaining
a greater population than the whole United States has to-day?
He pointed out the dangers in the pathway of our new national policTt
but showed how they could be obviated by inflexibly adhering to the prin
ciple that not another acre of the public lands should ever be parted with
to any one but an actual settler who had built his home on the land and
lived on it and got his livelihood from it for the full term of five years Te

He denounced the timber and stone act, the commutation clause of the
homestead act and the desert land act as mere instruments of fraud de
vised by ingenious minds for the purpose of despoiling the people of their
heritage in the public lands under the pretense, usually false and sham, of
the reclamation and settlement of the land. He made the startling state
ment that the locations of public lands now being made under these laws
aggregated in the neighborhood of twenty-five million acres a year and
were increasing at an appalling rate. He said that unless this raid on the
public lands was stopped, this generation would rue the day^ that it had
recklessly wasted the patrimony ofthe people of the nation in the public
domain.
"There is no other way." he said, "to etop these enormous abuses in
our public land system except to immediately repeal the desert land act.
the commutation clause of the homestead act and the timber and stone act.
The timber should be sold by the Government at reasonable rates to bona
fide manufacturers of lumber. It should not be wasted and thrown away to
mere speculators at $2 50 an acre as is being done under the present law.
The Commissioner of the General Land Office is authority for the striking
statement that the Government has disposed of timber worth over one
hundred and thirty million dollars for about thirteen million dollars, losing
over a hundred nnllion dollars by this shameful neglect and waste of our re
sources, and white fhis reckless looting of public property is going steadily
on, and each month increasing the loss of the Government, Congress lifts
no hard to stop it. and the raging forest fires annually sweep away millions
upon millions of dollars' worth of valuable Government timber because ade
quate funds were not available to stop the destruction."
TALKS TO PARENTS ON THE TRAINING OF CHILDREN
â¢Â¦Â¦*-Â¦ " Â¦ Â¦ -
>=g_ _ Sr^i HERE are so many things to be done and so many more
which should be avoided, it scarcely seems possible to
â¢"^l-iilr rÂ« say w^ at are c most ' m P ortant requites of proper
training. However, a very careful consideration of the
matter has led to the conviction that the following requi-
Tc^)araffi> 8 >tes are of the greatest importance. Indeed, it may be
la k to assert that the parents who can comply with
all these, all the time, will have but little, if any, trouble
in the management of their children. ;
First Requisite. J -
Children arc creatures of imitation. The first years, spent largely with
their parents, is the period when their natures are susceptible, in the highest
degree, to all kinds of impressions. Therefore one all-important requisite
for the proper training of a child is that the parents furnish the child with a
good example. By the parents' precept and example the child is being
daily cast in a certain mold. The noble and the base are being stamped in
the character of the child, and will go with it through life and make or mar
it for time and for eternity.
While it may be said that this is the case with all examples which in
fluence the child, yet it is especially so with the parents' example; for in
delibly fixed in the child's nature is the belicf^that what its parents do is
right and best.
Wonder not, then, that in the child is seen reflected, as from a mirror,
the parents' peculiarities, be they good or be they evil. By look, by
thought, by word and by act, the parents .sow the seed in the susceptible
heart of the child; seed which will take root, spring up, bud, blossom and
bear appropriate fruit. How terrible this truth 1 With what care this re
sponsibility should lead parents to strive for the cultivation, in themselves,
of better habits.
Second Requisite.
For the welfare of the child, as well as for the happiness of the parents, it
is absolutely essential that a child learn to obey. Very early in life a child
discovers that outside of himself there is a force to which he must bend. Very
early he should learn that to this authority he must yield implicit obedience.
As a child grows older he discovers that not only in the mother or father,
but in the school and in society, as well, there is authority which he must
respect.
The child who has been taught to obey â¢ his parents may. easily be
trained to do whatever the parents would have him do. A child who has
failed to learn the lesson of obedience has everything to learn. The parent
who can secure prompt, implicit obedience from a .child is not likely to
have any trouble in the management of that child. Since this is so it must
be acknowledged that one great requisite for the management of a child is
to secure the child's obedience. This is considered of such vital importance
that fuller treatment of the subiect will be given in a subsequent talk. At
that time the attempt will be made to show how obedience may easily be
secured.
On the part of the parents there is, too much disposition to criticize, and
*nn little thought a* to the examnle beiner eiven dailv and hourlv. Chil-
dren need more good models and less sharp critics. The- soil and the seed
are the parents', and so will be the harvest. Since the parents' precepts and
example so largely, determine the child's future happiness, what a grand
thing it would be if the child could select its parents. Too many parents
have given their children birth and nothing else.
Third Requisite.
Many parents arc heard to assert that they expect their youngest chil
dren to be controlled by correct principles. Though meaning well, such pa
rents make a grievous mistake. It is important that every parent should
clearly appreciate the truth and the importance of the statement that pTin
yciples are for adults and rules for children. The parent makes a serious mis
'take in striving to t^ain a child without the use of rules or other explicit di
rection. '
Even a young child quite early learns that certain are permitted,
while others are not. Such a child cannot understand the principles upon
which the facts depend, but such a child can be trained. to compliance with
demands when they are clearly understood. Children who quite early learn
to give compliance to fixed rules will have but little trouble in after years,
when they are compelled to bend to proper authority.
It must not be forgotten that upon the parents rests the responsibility
of fixing correct requirements. Subjection to rules of any kind will train
the child in habits of obedience, but will not train the child to be what he
should be, unless the rules themselves are based upon right. If they are not
S;o based, he will most likely give way to his impulses when he is freed
from the necessity of complying with the rules. The one great test of the
efficiency of any rule is the ease with which it may be done away with when
once it has been firmly established.' v \
Some will be disposed to say that the young child cannot be taught to
understand the meaning of a rule. Yet all careful observers know that
even a young child may be taught that he will not get what he cries for.
How many of us parents have failed to teach this to even our older chil
dren? Any child can exactly understand any rule before he can compre
hend principles underlying the establishment of the rule.
The child three or four years old who knows that certain punishments
are sure to follow the breaking of rules which the parents have made will not
even consider the violation of those rules. This fact was shown conclusively
in the writers' family within the past week. Edith, who is but three years
rAA tni/4 Umr r\\A*r KrntViprc that fill* wmiM tint 1Â«nvÂ»~ fli* tahip hpfnri* sliP
was excused because if she did she would have to tit on a chair a lonjr
time. Very gradually a child will learn that the rules are founded upon
what is right, and thereafter, will be governed, in part, by the principle in
volved.
Fourth Requisite.
The fourth requisite to be mentioned is that of kindness. Every parent
worthy of the name wishes to be kind. Too few love their children wisely.
Still less fully realize the all-conquering power of kindness. Those who havo
had experience with criminals will testify to the truth of the statement that
the callous heart of the confirmed criminal, though it makes no answer to
severity or suffering, yet becomes soft as a child's tinder the influence of real
kindness, against which no human tfeart is proof. Can it be that the hard
ened tenant of the prison cell is easier to reach than the Innocent child, so
deeply sensitive to every impression?
The greatest power on earth for preventing the loss b! a child, or for
reclaiming the wayward is the parents love, especially the mother's love.
None save the parent who in agony has watched the life ebb and flow, and
then has barely saved or finally lost a precious child, can have any concep
tion of a true parent's warmest love. V..,*
Countless thousands of young men and women have felt that the re
membrance of a precious mother's tender sympathy and unchanging love
has kept them in the narrow path when all else would have been in vain.
Â¦Truly, a noble mother is the most precious of all â the greatest wonder
of the world, the grandest miracle on earth, the highest glory of angels in
heaven, the most perfect work of Almighty God.
Fifth Requisite.
While loving kindness, if shown wisely, will generally be inffident to
influence a child, every child must at times feel that back of the kindness
there is a firmness which must be considered. By firmness is not meant
brutality or harshness, or even unkindness. The child should feel that tho
hand laid upon him is controlled by the love and tenderness of the mother
and the strength and firmness of the father.
While the very .young child must meet with nothing but Idndnes*, yet,
very early, it can learn what is meant by the restraining look or act. In
the early years, until implicit obedience becomes habitual, the demand for
firmness will be most frequent.
As the child grows older the necessity for its use should decrease, so
that by the time the child has reached the age of 10 or 13, when the child
begins to fret under absolute demands, there should be but little need of
commands. V
Uniform treatment is another very important requisite of proper train
ing. How few recognize its importance! To^day the parents' example is
diametrically opposite to what it was yesterday. The act punished with se
verity then is passed unnoticed now. At one time overwhelmed with kind
ness; at another crushed by firmness which amounts to positive cruelty,
if not brutality. To-day, petting; to-morrow, scolding. Yesterday, threats;
to-day, bribes. Under such fitful management is it to be wondered at that
"the, child is trained to no fixed principles of action? On the contrary, it is
but natural that the child's conduct comes to be determined by the mood of
the parent, rather than by the conviction of what is right. Very soon the
child learns to calculate chances and develop a wonderful ability to take
every advantage of government by spasms.weight on tne desk uncomfortably.
"Why should I resign?" demanded the
old conductor, angrily. "Resign?" He
rose from his chair. Ton know Vm a
thief. You're a thief yourself. You
helped make me one. I've carried more
men for you than for anybody else on the
whole division. I don't resign for any
body. Discharge me, damn you. I don't
ask any odds of you."
Haverly met It sullenly, yet he didn't
dare do anything. He knew Dave could
ruin him any day he chose to open hij
mouth. What he did not know was that
Dave Hawk was molded In a class of men
different from, his own. Every dishonor

"Where'd you get this?" he asked. In

"In the Soudan, sir."
Dave Hawk kept right on looking out
the window. Neither my conductor nor
the operator seemed to know Just what
the row was. Nobody spoke.
"What are you doing here?" Rocksby
went on.
"I came out to learn the cattle busi
ness." His brows went up easy like.
"Then I went bad with mountain fever,"
and he looked decent at me.
"You say you had your head out the

asked, sort of puzzled.
"I saw the white signal." Rocksby

"Smallest you got?"
I nodded as if I had a pocketful. Re
hustled around and came back with a
handful of money. I said - nothing, but
when he spread It out before me I aat
paralysed. I had just assumed that Dave
pleased and cared for no one; no superior
had any terror for Dave. He had a wife
somewhere back east of the river, they
said, that had sold him outâ that's why
he was In the mountainsâ and he lived
among the free-and-easy men a lonely
life. If anybody ever got close to him X

It came with a dean sweep through the
general offices at the river. Â¦ Everybody in

the bloods on our division went white

It came calm as sunshine and cold as a
northwester from the passenger conduc
tor behind me, from Dave Hawk, and It
pulled me into line like a bugle call. I
felt my English all back at once. Every
body beard him and looked my way;
again it was up to me. This time I was
ready for the superintendent, or, for that
matter, for the blooming mountain divis
ion. I had forgot all about my papers
till Dave Hawk epoke. I put my hand,
shaking. Into my inside vest pocket for
a piece of oilskinâ it was all I had left;
I was a good way from my base that
year. I laid the oilskin on the superin
tendent's table, unfolded It Jealously and
took out a medal and a letter that. In
rplte of the carefulest wrapping, was
creased and sweated. But the letter was
from my captain, and the bit of bronze
ties the Cross. Rocksby picked up the let
ter and read It.
"Have you been in the British army?"
be asked curtly.
"Yes. sir." -".';-,.'â¢*.Â¦''.
What could I cay? There were men who
Â£id know me. but they were a long cry
from the Rocky Mountains and the head
quarters of the mountain division. I
glanced about me from his face, gray as
alkali, to Allbers, shuffling on the carpet.
esd to Morrison, es steady as a success
ful liar, taking ray Job and my reputa
tion et one swallow, and to the passenger
conductor with the glossy black whiskers;
but he was looking out the window.
"What <3o I know about your word of
honor T' repeated Rocksby sharply. "All
fcers, take your man and get your time."
A wave of helpless rage swept over me.
The only thing I could think of was
strangling the lying operator In the hall.
Then somebody spoke. "Show your pa
pers, you damn fool."
"Mr. Rocksby," I protested, speaking up
to the division boss in a clean funkâ the
prospect of losing my Job that way,
through a lying operator, took the heart
clean out of meâ "you don't know me. It
la true, but I pledge you my word of
honor "
"What's your word of honor?" asked the
superintendent, cutt'.r.s Into me like a
hatchet. "I don't know any more about
your word of honor than I do about you."
I stood beadinz in a cold sweat, for I
could ece with half an eye it was going
egalnst us. The superintendent, an up
and up railroad man every inch and all
business, but suspicious, was leaning the
operator's way the Ftrongest kind.
There wasn't another soul in the little
room as the three of us stood before the
Fupcrintendent's dcEk except a passenger
conductor, who 6at behind me with his
feet on the window ledge, looking out into
the yard.
"Morrison's record In this office Is
clean," the superintendent was saying of
the operator, who was doing us smooth as
tmokeless powder. "He has never to my
knowledge lied In an investigation. But,
Allbers," continued the superintendent,
tpeaklng bluntly to my conductor, "you've
never told a straight story about that
Rat River switch matter yet. This man
Is a rew man," he added, throwing a hard
look at me. "Ordinarily I'd be inclined to
take the word of two men acainst one,
but I don't knetv one at all and the other
has done me ence. I can't see anything
for It but to take Morrison's word and let
you fellows both out. There wasn't any
wreck, but that's not your fault â not for
& minute."

etake for a man ordinarily, but It was
onÂ« for me Just then. We knew when
Wo went Into the superintendent's office
that somebody was to get fired; the only
question was who â the train crew or the
operator? Our engine crew were out of
it; it was up to the conductor and to me.
Had the operator displayed red signals?
The conductor sa:d no. I said no. the oper
ator eaid yee, but he lied. We couldn't
pi eve it; we could enly put our word
egalnst his; and. what made it the worse
for me. my conductor was something of
a liar himself.
I turned, snarling then, crazy as a wolf
all in a second, and somehow backed the
brakeman against the water cooler with
his windpipe twisted in my bony fingers
like a corkscrew. The train was moving
out. I had been cuffed and kicked until I
would rather kill somebody than not; this
seemed a fair chance for a homicide.
When tho poor fellow's wind went offâ he
wasn't much of a scrapper, I fancy â he
whipped around in the aisle like a dying
rooster. As he struggled in my grip there
behind him in the doorway stood Dave,
lantern in hand, looking on with a new
face. This time he was smilingâ Dave's
smile meant Just the parting of his lips
over a row of glistening teeth, perfectly
even teeth, and under his black mustache
whiter than any Ivory. It appeared to
amuse him to see me killing the brake
man. The Instant I saw Dave I let go
and he watched the crestfallen' trainman
pull himself together.
"Guess you'll let him alone now, won't
you?" said Dave pleasantly to my rattled
assailant. "Sit down," he growled harsh
ly at me, stringing his lantern on his

hours I hadn't eaten. I was just out of a

to the smoking car, drenched wet, and

brakeman grabbed me the .minute I
opened the front door and tried to kick
me out. *
fore very long I should fall off, anyway.
After I crawled down he stood looking
at me, and with nothing Getter on I stood
looking at him. .
"If you get up there again I'll break
your neck," he promised, holding up his
l8ntern.
I was quiet; the nerve was out of me.
"Where are you going?" he asked
filiort' v
"Medicine Ben
"Get into the smoker, you damn fool."
"We're getting into the Bend," he said
gruffiy. "Got any money for breakfast?"
"I haven't a cent on God's earth." He
put his hand in his pocket and pulling out
a handful of loose bills shoved one Into
my finders. ' "I'll take it from you and
gladly." I said, sitting up. "But I'm not a
beggar nor a tramp."
"Off tr.-.ck?"
"Yes. I'm going to enlist "
His teeth flashed. "That's worse than
railroading, ain't it?"
Something came into my head like a
rocket.
"If I could get started railroading "
"Get started easy enough."
That's how I happened to show him my
Victoria. He gave me a card to the train
master, and next day I went to braking
for Allbers, who, by the way, was the
biggeBt liar I ever knew.
But the morning I got into Medicine
Bend that first time on No. 1 I had an
other scare. I went into the lunch room
for coffee and sandwiches and threw my
bill at the boy. He opened it, looked at
it and looked at me.
"Well." I growled, for I^as impudent
Irishman with a bottle of rank whisky
gave me a stinger and I wanted to live
again. I curled up on the seat and In five
minutes I was roasting, oh, such a hea
enly roast; and dozing. Lord! what a
heavenly dote, before that Baker heater.
All night the forward truck beat and
pounded, under me: all night I woke and
slept In the steaming, stinking air of the
hot car. And whenever I opened my
eyes I saw always the same thing, a top
ping tall conductor looming In the aisle,
his green-hooded lamp, like a semaphore,
under his arm. And above, In the gloom,
a bush of black beard and a pair of deep
set, shining eyes back under a peaked
cap. Dave often comes back as I saw
him, waking and dreaming, that night in
the smoker of No. 1.
It was breaking day when he bent over
the heads of our passenger conductor

freight men. Rocksby had resigned a
year earlier, and Haverly, bis successor,
an ex-dispatcher, and as big a knave as
there was on the payroll, let the men out
right and left with the sole Idea of sav
ing his own scalp. By the time I was up
to a passenger train the old force was
pretty much cleared out except Dave.
Every day almost we looked to see him
go. Everybody loved him because ho was
a master railroad man. and everybody ex
cept Dave himself was apprehensive
about his future. He moved on Just the
same, calm and cold as Ice water, taking
the same old chances, reckless of every
thing and everybody. I never knew till
afterward, but the truth was Haverly.
with all his bluff talk, was Just enough
afraid of Dave Hawk to want to let him
alone. The matter, mough, focused one
day up In the old office In an unexpected
way.
Haverly's own Beat got to hot that, be

to discharge Dave who now sailed up and
down the line reckless as any plrats of

It was a queer deal out on the West End
In those days. It was a case of wide
open from the river to the Rockies.
Everybody on the line, from the directors
to the car tinks, were giving the com
pany the worst of It. The section hands
hooked the ties for the maintenance, the
painters drank the alcohol for the shel
lac, the purchasing agent had more fast
horses than we had locomotives, and
what made It discouraging for the con
ductors, the auditors stole what llttla
money the boys did turn In.
A hard place to begin railroading, the
old line was then; but that's where I had
to tackle the game, and in all the hard
crowd I mixed with Dave Hawk was the
only man on the division. There were
others there who fixed the thing ap by
comparing notes on their collections and
turning In percentages to make their re
ports look right; but Dave was not a con
spirator â never made a confidant of any
man In his stealing or his spending, and
despised their figuring. He did as he

hunted up Dave to pay him back. I

Yet I never saw a face harder in some
ways than Dave Hawk's. His visor hid
his forehead and a black beard covered

"We'll adjourn this thing." said he at
last, "tf.1 I look Into it a little further.
For the present, go back to your runs."
We never heard any more of it. Albers

stuff and 'turned to thank Dave Hawk.
He was gone.

It wasn't the first time Dave had pulled
me out of the water. About two weeks
before that I had crawled one night up
on the front platform of the baggage at
Peace River to steal a ride to Medicine
Bend on No. 1. It was Dave's train. I
had been kicked out of the McCloud hos
pital two days before without a cent or
a friend on earth outside of the old coun
try. and 1 I hadn't mind to bother the
folks at homo any more, come Conan or
the devil.
The night was bitter bad, black as a
Fuzzy, and sleeting out of the foothills
like manslaughter. When the train
stopped at Rosebud for water, what with
gripping the icy hand rail and trying to
keep my teeth steady on my knees I must
have been a hard sight. Just as the train
Â¦was ready to pull out Dave came by and
poked his lantern full in my face.
He was an older man than I, a good
bit older, for I was hardly more than a
kid then, only spindling tall, and so thin
I couldn't tell a stomachache from a
backache. As I fat huddled down on the
Ice step, with my cap pulled over my
head and ears, he poked his light full
into my face and snapped, "Get out!"

have been worse scared, and I found aft

their lanterns as If they had more im

Dave left tho office groggy. The best
Bucks could do he couldn't get a positive
answer out of him. He was overcome and
couldn't focus on the proposition. Bucks
saw how he had gone to pieces and man

with him as assistant, filling ln mean
while as trainmaster.

I was ordered west that night to bring
a military special from Washakie. I rode
up on Dave's train. The hind Los Angeles
sleeper was loaded light and when Dave
had worked the train and walked into the
stateroom to sort his collections I fol
lowed him. We sat half an hour undis
turbed, but he wouldn't talk. It was a
heavy train and the wind was high.
Wo made Rat River at midnight and. I
was still sitting -alone ln tho open state
room when Z saw Dave's green light com
ing down tha darkened aisle. He walked
ln, put his lamp on the floor, sat down
and threw his feet on thÂ« cushions.
"How's Tommie to-night?" ha asked,
leaning back as If he hadn't seen me be

He shifted; and It' wasn't nee him to

"I'm going to quit the "West End."
"Quit? What do you mean? You're not
going to throw over this trainmaster of

"I'm going to quit What's the use?"
he went on slowly. "How can I take
charge of conductors, talk to conductors?
How can I discharge a conductor for
stealing when he knows I'm a thief my
self? They know It; Bucks knows It
There's no place among men for a thief."
"Dave, you take It too hard; everything
fan wide open here. You're the best rail
road man on tHls division; everybody, old
and new, admit* that."
"I ought to be a railroad man. I held
down a division on the Panhandle when I
was 80 years old."
"Were you a railroad superintendent

He bent to pick up his lantern. "Tom

"Well, I mean It" He looked at his
watch; I pulled mine; It was 1 o'clock.
"Better go to sleep, Tommie." I looked
up into his .{ace 'as ho rose. Ho looked
for an Instant steadily Into mine. "Go
to bed, Tommie," he smiled"; pulling; down
his visor and turning, he walked slowly
forward. I | threw myself on the couch
and drew my cap over my eyes. Tho first
thing I felt was a hand on my shoulder.
Then I realized I uad been asleep and
that the train was standing still. A man

It was over. The front lamps were out
and tha car smoking bluish. A cowboy
hung pitched head and arms down over
the heater seat In the middle- of tho

tha dark front end of tha coach I saw
the outline of a man sprawled on his face

A game cowboy back of him pulled a

go down, wounded. But the train boy
said Hawk himself had dropped the two
bead men almost immediately after tho
the San Francisco cars ana tho Port
land I ran without meeting a living soul;
but the silence was ominous. When I
caught a glimpse of the Inside of tha
chair car I saw tho ferment Women
were screaming and praying and men
were burrowing under the footrests.
"They've killed everybody ln the smoker"
shouted a traveling man, grabbing me.
"Damnation, make way, won't you!" I
exclaimed, pushing away from him
through the mob. At tha forward door,
taking me for ono of the train robbers,
there was another panic Passengers
from tha smoker were Jammed together

bodily across the seats to get through and
Into the forward car.
Of course, we have not any such amount
of tho human element in our landscapes
as Europe has. Italy has been building
for a thousand yearsâ California for fifty.
The only traces of people hero before tho
middle of the last century lie in the
adobes, and these have to be hunted for.
The painter usually wants a touch of tha
human ln a picture. He finds this ln tho
countries that aro old, where ruined
buildings aro scattered everywhere; but,
although we have so little, what there Is
cannot be excelled for romantic associa
tion, and ln tlmo we shall have more.
Leaving out tho human element, tho
purely pastoral Is unexcelled in any way.
The brown stretches of our summers have
a tonality that one misses everywhere
else. Tho green of tho East Is hard and
merciless. Tho brown slopes and tho oc
casional relief of tho rich green of a tree
axe perfect
If one goes back into tha mountains ha
will find tha changing autumn colors, too.
that aro ono of the artist's greatest de
lights. Not tho first and most brilliant
colors, but the russets of tha later pe
riod are the most beautiful.
Near at hand there Is a wealth of ma
terial In the vicinity of Tamalpals. Tho
Marln County pictures are a delight
There Is always the mountain for a
glimpse in tha background.
Near, too. are the marshes. The tules
hold fascination for the brush.
For grandeur nothing can compare ln
tho world, I believe, with tho "immense"
scenery in the State; but I do not believe
that this has any place on canvas. It
cannot even be suggested in any way to
do Justice to Its grandeur. A canvas Is
too small. So the artist will do well to
stay nearer the coast For that matter,
he need not leave San Francisco for In
spiration. Any day he will find Italy at
our own Fishermen's wharT. And Italy
Is what he has been sighing tor.
If the finding of subjects to paint wero
tho only consideration thero would bo no
reason why a painter should ever leavo
here. The reason for his going away some
times Is another matter altogether. Ha
must come ln touch with other minds,
must seek tho criticism of bigger men
than he Is If ha Is to grow. The art cen
ters ara ln Europe. But nowhere ln
Europe will ho find better themes for his
canvas than hero ln our own State and
tho wanderer returns to try California
scenes again from a newly acquired point
of view. He ought to bo able to do mora
Justice to tho wealth of material hero aft
er every Jog that ho makes Into tho busier
world of competition. He ought to bo abla
to bring back something new ln return
/tor that which ho took away. He has
somo experience to offer ln payment for
tho poetry which tho great State's moun
tains and brown Blopes and blue waters
planted In him. London and Paris may
open his eyes to phases of art which ho
never dreamed of before, but ho will
search all Europe over for any of Nature's
pictures that surpass thoso of our West
ern State. They are not to be found. Wa
have right here at home, at least within
tho boundary of tho State, all that tho
landscape artist could want for a life
time of work. The man who waits to
paint until he can have more worthy
themes will never paint at alL
Our artists seem to havo approciated
their privileges. They aro loyal to Cali
fornia and they have done somo wonder
ful work ln reproducing her many moods.
Look at what Keith has done ln our very
near neighborhood where tho oaks grow.
Look at the old Spanish llfo that has
taken hold of Charlie Peters' Imagination
with such beautiful results. McComas Is
interpreting the strango and mystical
trees of Monterey ln a way all his own
and full of Inspiration. In fact, tho whola
Monterey colony of artists havo proved,
by settling there, that they appreciate
the treasures near at hand.
Well they may, for out of all tho
treasure stores of the State, I doubt If
there Is any locality to vie with Monterey.
In the first place, there Is the beach and
water to be reveled In by any one who
has the least touch of poetry In his make
up. It is a good deal like Italy. The Call.
fornla water Is not so blue as that of tho
Mediterranean, it has not the peculiar
composition to give It Just that color, but
It has wonderful beauty. Tho reddish
rocks are similar to those In Europe.
Turn ln another direction and you find
the fascinating trees, gnaried and twisted
and fantastic. It takes a very slight
stretch of the imagination to see weird
spirits abiding in and possessing them.
Turn again, and you find the relics of
the old Spanish life, full of color and
brilliancy and romance by tradition. Tha
least glimpse of one of these relics, a
crumbling adobe cottage even, will call
up a train of pictures of fandangos, and
guitars, and beautiful women and daring
cabelleros. These Spanish traditions aro
the only ones that our young State pos
sesses as yet, except those scant ones be
longing to the Indian tribes, and perhaps
they mean tho more to us for that very
reason. Wo should cling to the vestiges
left of that life, not letting them dlaap
pear as they are beginning to do. Restor

need. Thero Is such a thins as restor
ing too much. It takes some ago and tha
signs thereof to soften a building Into It3

A queer fhadow went over Dave's face.
"When Bucks began he was getting s

The Ellen t conductor turned to stone.

"That's why I've sent for you." Bucks
resumed.

big fighting chiefs of the mout>rÂ» :; rfioux.
For three months Bucks sat his new
saddle without a word or an act to show
what he was thinking; then there came
from the little room a general order that
swept right and left from train master to
wrecking boss. The last one of the old
timers in the operating department went
except Dav* Hawk.
The day the order was bulletined Bucks
pent for Dave; sent word by me he wanted
to see him.
"Come or." raid Dave to me when I
Cave him the message.

against my inclination, I went up with

"Long as anybody, I guess," said Dave,
curtly. *
"Hcv.- many years?"
â¢'Nineteen."
"There's Lecn some pretty lively shake

Bucks. The veteran conductor looked at
him co:d'y. "I am trying to 6hape things
here for en entire new deal."
"Don't let me etand in your way," re
turned Dave, grimly.
"That's what I want to s?e you about

"Then I'll tell you what I want "
"I don't resign. You can discharge me
er.y minute."
"I wouldn't atk any man to res'gn.
Dave, if I wanted to discharge him. Don't
rnekf- a mistake like that. I suppuse you
will admit there's room for Improvement
In the running cl this division?"
Dave never twitched. "A whole lot of
Improvement." Bucks, with perceptible
emphasis, added. It came. from the new
Buperinttndent as a sort of gauntlet, and
Dave ricked It up.

or blockade, Dave Hawk's train came and
went on tlra*. or very close. So he rode,
erica old privateer, with his letters of
znarQue, on the company's strong box,
and Haverly trembled night and day. till
that day came that fear had foretold to
him. A clap of thunder struck the Wick
iup and Haverly's head fell low, and Dave
Hawk sailed boldly on.
I was extra passenger man when John
Btanley Bucks took the West End. Ho
came from south of our country, and wo
heard great things about the new super
intendent and about what would happen
as Boon as he got Into tha saddle. What
few of the old men In tho Wickiup were
left looked at Bucks Just once and began
to arrange their temporal affairs. His
appearance bore out his reputation. Only
everybody, while pretty clear In his own

to what he would have to doâ wondered
what Dave would do.
Bucks at tha end of the week that ha
would like another week to make his de

Everybody began to make greet things of
Dave; some of the boys called him train
master and told him to drop his punch
and give Tommie a show.
He dJdn't take the humor the way one
would expect. Always silent he grew
more than that, somber and dejected. We
never saw a smile on hjs face. "Dave is

STORY

/\Mackay's wit was quick and occasion
ally scathing. After an absence of sev
eral years in Arizona, I visited San Fran
cisco. In the Palace Hotel court Mackay
accosted me saying Jestingly, "Now that
you have got rich in Arizona (alas! this
was not true), I suppose that you won't
speak to your old friends any more?"
I replied, humoring his Jest, "Well, John,
we millionaires can hardly be civil to a
poor man without his trying to borrow
money of us. I'll speak to you, of course,
but don't you take advantage of It to try
and negotiate a loan." Just**- then C.
P. Huntington, who was visiting San
Francitco on one of his annual tours,
crossed the. hot el oflice and accosted me.
We shook hands, and I, noticing that
Mackay and Hunting ton did not speak to
ent of a leading mine, each man was al
lowed to use any means that he might
devise to stimulate his grasshopper. The
professor was so full of his scheme to
scientifically capture the thousand-dollar
poolâ for there were ten entriesâ that he
communicated it to a young ossayer,
who was not a grasshopper plunger. The
professor had experimented^ and ascer
tained that a grasshopper who wa?
touched by a feather dipped in a weak
solution of aqua ammonia would jump for
his life. The young man also experiment
ed, and as a result he filled a bottle of
the same size and appearance with cya
nide of potassium and managed to sub
stitute it for the other in the professor's
laboratory. The next day when the pro
fessor, after much boasting about hla
scientific attainments, dipped a feather in
the fcubstituted bottle ana touched his
insect with It the grasshopper rolled over
as dead as a salt mackerel amid the roars
of the crowd. Mackay's hopper won the
big pool, and two widows, whose hus-

Largest Kitchen in th.8 World
In the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New
York, there are fourteen chefsâ not mere
scullions, but graduated chefsâ "dlplome,"
as the French say. There are eleven more
Just to make sauces, and ten to do noth
ing but fry things. It takes twenty-eight
men to make the soups and cook the vege
tables, and twenty more for icecreams
and pastry. All told, there are 131 men
down in that- big kitchen, of whom seven
do nothing but cook M eals for the other
174.
This big kitchen where they wort
covers 30,000 square feet of space. In It are
two immense ranges, each containing
eighteen separate nres. Five men con
stantly tend them, dorn* nothing else.
These ranges take up 2000 square foet.
Then there are six b!g game broilers, a
big steel oven with four compartments,
three bake ovens and a pastry oven, stx
giant copper caldrons for the vegetables.
six steel broilers for meats, fifteen cof
fee urr.s and dozens of tables, heaters and
chopping blocks.
Bach department is separate la this b!Â»
kitchen. One cordon bleu chef watches
over all. Instead of standing near a red
hot stove, % he sits at a desk, and never
goes near an oven or a broiler. The roast
cooks never bother with pastry; the Ice*
cream men never look at a vegetable.
The soup men would turn up thstr nosea
at a salad mixer, and the saucemakars
grow stern at the thought of opening
oysters.
This great kitchen can serve fTOO pas*.
sons for each meal and never get fluster*
ed. This is the 'high-water mark. Ytt
It could turn out much more without get
ting upset. It can cook soup . for COCO,
coffee for 6000. roasts tor 4000. salad fa*
1200. 4000 loaves of bread, 275 gallons of loe
cream, 2100 dozen oysters, gams for Hvtj

The next fall tho manager' of the Eu
reka Cattle Company ranch v.-rote to his
old friend. "I havÂ« kept up all expenses
so far from the pale of steers and the
cattle have Increased nearly one-third,
but I need a lot of ca^h to pay taxes and
put In more pipe, and betf on tiie hoof
has gone down. I think it not best to
pell any more at going prices, and maybe
you had better send me the money neeJ
i-d." By return mall the manager re
ceived a letter from Mackay saying, "I
am not lending money to old Idiots who
tear up checks. Pay your own taxes; if
you haven't the cash, borrow It from the
bank. You had better look at the records
and find who owns your old ranch."
And the old man found that Mackay
had deeded him the ranch months before
âconsideration, the friendship and regard
of John W. Mackay.
An eld mining partner of Mackay, who
had not seen him for years, came to Baa
Francisco from the Slsklyon Mountains
and called upon the multi-millionaire at
his office in the Nevada block. Mackay
greeted his old friend, warmly Invited
him to dinner, drove with him to- the
Cliff House, accompanied him to the thea
ter, and fos>two days and nights aband
oned all other engagements to entertain
him. On the morning: of the third day
the old miner called at the bank to bid
which scattered compromlslngly In all di
rections through the throng. / - .
"Let me help you," Carrington jumped
with alacrity to her aid, restoring the
downy, pink-cheeked fruit to her arms.
An Icy "thank you" rewarded him.
Woman-like, angry at the Innocent of

ure on him. r
"I suppose your cousin meets your*
he Inquired, pausing for a second as the
ladles accompanying him moved on.
"Oh, yes," she replied lightly, hoping;
j
lighting in his slightest mannerism. Be
tween them lay the unconfessed joy of
a past summer-time, when he had. been
her constant attendant at this same place
â until golden-haired Lilian Royer arrived
qne day as a guest of his mother. In
voluntarily she sighed, and the man,
finding ita echo in his own heart, re
peated it.
"You will be at the hop to-night?;; he
asked, as he deposited her at her desti
nation. I
"My frock is here," she pointed to her
suit case. :':Â¦*'* :':''â¢
'Tour cousin said Egerton was coming
down, too." He watched her face nar
rowly as he spoke.
"A later train," she said evenly. "I de
cided to come on the 3 o'clock special."
He could make nothing of her explana
tion, however, as he thought her words
ever after leaving her. i Surely, If report
were true that the two were In love and
to be married, it looked odd that they did
not plan. to arrive on the same train. His
mind revolved on Janet's speech In spite
of his attempt to dismiss it.
Janet promptly thought on more about
him, unable long ago to find an excuse
for his changed : behavior. . Opening 1 her
suit case she began to draw out her small
wardrobe ; the articles seemed peculiarly
unfamiliar. She shut It hastily, Intently
scanning the modest initials, "J. A.," on
the aide. It surely was - hers, but how
could It be when before her was a vision
of . fluffy, lace-trimmed . pink crepe - de
chine, with a low-cut bodice bordered
\Kjth daintyj wild rose*; j pink silk stock
ings, a pink fan. a rose spray for the
hair, and down In one corner a pair of
high-heeled pink slippers? . What halluci
nation of the brain was this? Or was it
the triumph of an acgTetatlon of the
day's annoyances?
She laughed and cried hysterically.
They belonged to somebody else, but she
either had to wear them or remain at
home. The ample dimensions of Aunt
Caroline's dresses forbade any further
consideration of them.
Like her prototype, Pandora, when she
opened the case, she let the witches out.
The woman who hesitates meets the pro
verbial fate. By the aid of pins the waist
was adjusted trimly to her more slender
figure; the toes of the frivolous slippers
were stuffed out with tissue paper, and
the balance of the toilette was made to
her complete satisfaction.
. The hop progressed as all similar af
fairs do where there Is a sprinkling of
black coats and pretty girls. Janet, prom
cuadlng the room on Kgerton's arm. rec
ognized a familiar white frock coming
toward her. With sickening dread of an
Impending scene she saw that its wearer
was Lilian Royer, and Carrington walked
beside her.V -
"I am afraid there has been some mis
take in our suit cases," Miss Royer cried
sharply. "I don't see how it could pos
sibly have happened. You must have
taken mine â by mistake."
Janet drew herself up ominously, indig
nant at the' insinuation.
' "The Initials were the same as . mine,"
she explained, with- very, red cheeks. "To
all outward appearance It looked like
my suit case. Since I came down here
for the dance, I had no alternative but
to wear " this" dress" or stay " at home. It
was no fault of mine that the mistake
was made, I assure you."
Mls3_ Roy cr ! glanced contemptuously at
the white dress she wore. "I was forced
to wear yours," she said, "not having any
other with me. ; I took my sister's suit
case, Mrs. ' Adamsâ Julia's. She used
mine, for , it . held more. I am sure you
will not object to coming with me now to
the dressing-room and exchanging."
"Certalnly not," Janet said proudly.
There was a frown settling on Carting,
ton's brow. He was conscious of a strong
desire to take Janet In his arms and an
athematize Miss Royer In forcible terms.
But the sting of a broken half-promise
and forgotten vows held him aloof.
"What a little hypocrite she Is," Miss
Royer exclaimed to him as he took her
across the floor. "She knew all along It
was mine." Carrington made no com
ment. '
Half an hour later, after a solitary
smoke In a retired corner of the piazza,
he came upon a little white figure crying
all alone.
"Janet." he whispered anxiously. bend-
Ing tenderly over her. "Don't cry. Where
Is that confounded Egerton? He
shouldn't leave you here alone." â¢
She raised her head proudly, her tear

O'Brien died Boon after he came into his
Croat fortune, but while he lived went

keeper, and in his- contest for financial
supremacy with William C. Ralstonâ the
cashier and controlling spirit cf the Hank
of Californiaâ the latter Is reported to
have said. "I will FÂ«nd Flood back to his
original business of selling cocktails."
When this threat was communicated to
Flood, he replied. "If I do. I will sell
them over the counter of the Bank of
California." When the great bank stepped

Flood negotiated for the purchase of the
bank building, purposing to fit It up as a
saloon with carved counter for a bar. be
hind which he designed, arrayed In a
white apron, to officiate as barkeeper for
a day. It was with great difficulty that
Mackay and Fair dissuaded him from ex
ecuting this scheme of vengeance upon
the <!cad Ralston.
Fair was the inventor of a plan to dis
courage widows and orphans who first of
fered proof of an alleged marriage with a
millionaire after his death. He provided
In his will that every lady who should
prove herself to be his widow, and every
child who should establish a title to call
him father, shoud be entitled to receive
from his estate a legacy of one hundred
dollars.
Mackay'e generosity was unostentatious

of public benefactions. A few months be
fore his death he locked himself in his
office with his private secretary and de
stroyed notes, receipts and other evidence
of loans and gifts to the amount of sev
eral millions of dollars.
It was not only the poor who lacked
food and shelter who were relieved by
him, but his benefactions extended to
those who. Impoverished by ill fortune,
yet struggled desperately with fate, and,
like the Spartan boy. smiled in the face
of the world while the wolf of disaster
Â¦was eating at the vitals.
Of a lawyer once prosperous, but who
had lost his practice, a gentleman said
to Mackay: "The Judge dresses well and
he lives In a handsome house, but I hap
pen to know that his wife's diamonds
and furs are In pawn, that his furniture
and law library are covered with chattel
mortgages, that his rent and servant hire
and grocery bills are unpaid, that his

has such a nice family. Such distress Is

so position to maintain. Dick, draw a
cheek for a thousand dollars and send
it to him." "He won't take It. Mr.
Mackay/* replied the secretary. "He Is
as proud as Lucifer, and I believe that
rather than accept charity he would com
mit suicide." "Is It as bad as that?"
said Mtckay. "Well, we'll find a way
to make him take 1L What baa become

replied the secretary. "Well, you hunt
up some other lawsuit, any old lawsuit.
Sure there's enough of them bothering us
when we don't want them. You employ
the Judge in It to assist our other law
yers and pay him a thousand dollars, and
don't you let on to him that I have any

Mtfkay 1 ! gifts sometimes took an ec
centric form. He would send a hundred
dollars or more to & widow "with tho

capitalist vaa not only driven wild with
protestations of gratitude, but bis outer

"I'm glad you didn't forget the $4 â¬0.

check up and throwing the pieces into
the wastebasket. "You're a fine book
keeper. Johnny, i )U t you're alsj the b-g?

"If you won't 1ft me do something for

I have loaned a lot of monev to the
Eureka Cat:!e Company and they have

I have got to tike the ranch in. Now I

the property for me. and if I take it you
must act as manager, and I'll pay: you

man, "that I'll do."
Leland Stanford was the philosopher
and prophet of the pioneer overland road.
Charles Crocker was Its right arm. but
C. P. Hunurgton was Its brain. Crock
er's favorite seat was upon the cowcatch
er of the locomotive on the construction
train, ever pushing to the front with rest
less energy. Stanford with dominant In
dividuality controlled men, controlled cau
cuses, reconciled conflicting interests and
placated enmities. But C. P. Huntlngtoa
was the master spirit. When the finan
cial necessities of the road called him to
New York City he was no longer a young
man and he was without special train
ing for his task. But from the hour h*
entered Wall street until death called hira>
he was successful In his operations. Rival
capitalists could not entrap him and he
was not to be bullied either by
men or events. When one who
had come Into possession of a bun
dle of his letters, that were aft*
erward used in the Colton case, tried to
sell them to him for a large amount his
cool and characteristic reply was: "They
are worth the money, but I have read
them. You want to sell them to some*
body who has not read thexnT** He ha4
the courage of his convictions. IIo be
lieved that the construction of an Inter
oceanic canal would have a tendency to

struction. VI t will never be built while X

He was a strong friend and a bittsr
enemy. He was a grand old fighter, who
fought ever In the ,open- When he en
tered the lists he passed by all lessor
antagonists and smote the brazen shields
of the Brian de Bois Gullberts. Whoa
he began the hazardous experiment of
constructing an overland road there were
not fifty miles of railroad, all told, be
tween the Rocky Mountains and the Pa
cific Ocean. He lived to see the locomo
tives of seven great transcontinental Unea
thundering dally from the Missouri to the
Pacific, and to be able to ride in his pri
vate car from arctic to tropic seas. His
most appropriate epitaph would be his re
ply to a member of a committee of the
United States Senate, who said to him
when he was examined as a witness be
fore the Interstate Commerce Commis

his reply, "the highest regard for the good

A MODERN PAND0RA
The Reptile House at the Zoo.
The reDtlle house was one of the first
buildings erected at the New York Zoo
and It is well worthy to be the corner
stone of bo noble a scheme. The en
trance Is Into a small hall or lobby, con
taining the reptiles of the temperata zonal
from this one enters into the main hall.
At the western end of the main hall I*
the alligators' pool. This pool extends
across the end of tha building, and U fif
teen feet wide and four feet deep. A con
servatory back of It completes the pic
ture of a Florida lagoon. The American
crocodiles and alligators are here wall
represented, writes Elwia R. Sanborn la
Pearson's.
In the center of the hall Is an tnclosure
with glass partitions, open at the top. for
the small turtles and terrapins. A stream
of water flows through the center
and terminates In a large pool, now oo
cupled by an enormous alligator terrapin,
weighing one hundred and fifteen pounds.
All around the Bides of the hall ara ar
ranged glass cases with a representative
collection of boas, pythons, and venom
ous snakes, tropical, sub-tropical and
temperate. A marvelous collection of
southern water snakes, comprising many
rare species, together with all the con
strictors of the tropical zone, !s also oa
exhibition. The lizards, ranging from a
six-foot Ceylonese monitor to tbÂ« various
chameleons, are well represented. When
safely housed behind glass, reptiles are
always sightly. Invariably the question
asked Is. "Where are the snakes?* and
on Sunday the capacity of this building
la taxed to the utmost.
Mackay was an early riser, a hanl
worker, and, although exceedingly ho.s
pltable.was himself abstemious and could
seldom be induced to play cards for
money, and then for only nominal stakea.
The only game that seemed to attract him
was the "grasshopper races," with which
the mining superintendents on the Com
stock beguiled a portion of the noon
hour, while waiting for luncheon at the
Savage Company hoisting-house. Boys
caught grasshoppers and sold them to the
players at 25 cents to W cents each. Each
player oaid a fixed stake, ranging from
one dollar to twenty dollars, into the pool,
and the man whose hopper made the
longest jump captured the pool. On the
day before Christmas it was agreed to
celebrate that holiday with a pool, the
stakes In which were to be one hundred
dollars for each player. The terin3 were
"play or pay." and at the instance of a
German professor who was a superintend-

smaller than a nickel. It should be so
that you can' buy something for a penny."
"What," said Mackay, "do you want to
buy for a penny?" "An apple, for In
stance," rejoined Huntlngton. "But,"
said I, "you can buy five apples for five
cents." v'What?" said Mackay.' "and
give away the other four, and break his
heart?"
This, though witty, was not Just to
Huntingdon, who was net by any means a

touched his hat with mock deference and
answered, "John W. is my first name, If

The conversation drifted Into com
ments upon the growth and prospects of
San Francisco. "The people must get
rid of their expensive ways," said Hunt
iriEton, "before San Francisco will real

cheapest city to live In In America," said
Mackay. "That may be so," I suggested,

RECOLLECTIONS AND REFLECTIONS
OF THOMAS FITCH.
14General Pippin and his staff went o'er the gory groundT
The sight caused them to shudder, for almost* everywhere
Were injured beans and grains of corn quite hopeless of repair.
While viewing all the carnage greatâ the mangled beans and corn.
An Idea quite pretentious was in CroÂ©kneck*s keen mind born.
"Of course," the lumbering Crookneck said, "I am sorry for the maimed,
But it strikes me that what's lost to some is to some others gained.
Now, since the battlefield is strewn with corn and beans galore,
HI suggest that we in. chart e reap profit from this war.
My plan for us great gallants three to load ourselves with cash
Is to mix the.f alien corn and beans, and call it succotash."
This commercial spirit ruled, my sweets, I much regret to say,
But old Crookneck and the others lived to rue another day
But your thoughts are of the Princess, and of the King so grand,
And of the greater glory that should come to this great land.
When Cannibal Corn saw freedom gone he confessed in manner grave
That he kept the Princess Artichoke a prisoner in a cave.
"Lead on to this biding place," the King's commander said,
"And if you will turn the Princess free we shall spare your head."
"Rippety sick and whickety whack," the cannibal chieftain cried.
Which .means, in words translated, that he'd free the future bride.
Very soon the Princess fair was taken to the King.
Who at his great good fortune was too glad for anything.
He sent bis faithful hosts away that he might be alone
To tell the beautiful Artichoke all about his palace home.
He whispered that he thought she was the fairest In the land,
And that he'd be ever so much obliged If she would take bis hand
The Princess blushed and hung her head, but didn't say a thing,
And the monarch knew her silence meant that she would wear the ring.
In time the mighty sovereign called his faithful subjects all
And told them that they'd have a Queen quite early in the falL

The doughty General and his staff â composed you may remember,
Of Crookneck Squash, the timid one, and Radisli sleek and slender.
Sped over verdant plain until their bodies felt like lead,
The gallant Pippin all the time appearing at the head.
The story as I get it, pets, is that the searchers good
Mislaid their compass in their haste and got lost in a wood.
Now, this was awful, you may say; but all things come out right '..,'"
When pluck and perseverance strong are made up into might
Good old Mother Nature watched the wandering subjects three.
And,* admiring much their purpose, she helped to set them free.
Faithful fireflies by the host, responding to her call,
Changed the darkness into light and cheered the subjects all.
They kept the heavy-scented air ablaze with vivid fire
Until King Pumpkin's messengers escaped the dangers dire. .
Across a glorious sun-lit plain, with courage now renewed, .
The valiant searchers sped away, their voices much subdued.
At last, far in the distance, they beheld a moving thing
The like of which they knew was not a subject of their King*.
"Tis the oddest of all odd things," the/ General did exclaim,
When they had crept up near enough to view the stranger plain,
"I, for one," spoke Crookneck Squash, his voice betraying fear,
"Cannot say that I admire his looks and running gear.
Such lengthy legs I ne'er have seen â and I have seen a lot.
And I know that he could catch us all before away we sot."
Gallant Pippin's eyes flashed fire, his brow took on a frown.
And he forthwith proceeded hot to stand up lor the crown
"What should our august sovereign say," he snapped in sharpest strain,
If we should quit and leave this monster master of the plain? - -
He'd call us weak and cowardly, and we all should fall from grace,
And we should never nave the heart to look him in the face." -
The better part of valor," spoke the thoughtful Radish red,
"Is wisdom and not rashness, for such wise Prune has said.
Now, I suggest that Crookneck Squash, with all his greatest speed, -Â¦>
Go back to the King and get the added strength we need,**
In less time than it takes to tell, old Crookneck was away
His mind the seat of much relief, his heart both light end gay.'
In time he reached the monarch, and the reinforcements wanted
Were soon dispatched with him as. headâ all brave and quite undaunted*
The forces which he proudly led were made up, so it seems, :
Entirely of the sovereign's brave .and finely trained String B cans.
At the direction of bold Pippin, the eager soldiers small
Charged in perfect order to engage the stranger tall.
The object of the sharp attack on that most beauteous morn
Was a cannibal chieftain fierce and wild whose name was Roasting Corn*
For many an hour the battle ragedâthe ultimate end in doubt,
And thrice the soldiers of the King were put to utter rout.
The string of many a worthy bean was snapped in hopeless twain
And the furious eannibal suffered loss of many a valued grain.

PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 28.â The North
American to-morrow will say: Consoli
dated Lake Superior stockholders will
move formally to-morrow for the re
ceivership as the surest way to protect
their .equity in the property. This action

by a petition for an injunction to restrain
the sale of. the Speyer collaterals.

At the hotel the attaches would give no

A story is current to-night that Mrs.

Instead the railway officials essayed to
capture the robbers by a ruse. This, how
ever,' failed ignominious^'. The light en
gine was sent out as directed and the
supposed package of $50,000 was in plain
view. Approaching the spot appointed
the engine was slowed down, but before
it came to a full stop a second light.en
gin*,- on. -which" there.. were a dozen of
more heavily armed men, hove Into sight."
Search was made of the immediate vicin-*
ity, but none of the conspirators were to"
be found.' Ths railroad officials had given
out as- a- reason for- running the light en
gines that they had received warning of
an attempt to hold up the North Coast
limited.
The railroad officials have since been
warned that, because of their "trifling,"
the original threat would now be car
ried out, . and. it certainly begins to look
that way. Within the past two weeks no
less than four attempts have been made
to wreck trains by the use of dynamite.
One of these was a passenger and the
others were freight trains, the latest at
tempt being made at Sampson Siding last
night.
As yet no serious damage has resulted.
although the cowcatcher and headlight
were blown off a passenger engine in x the
Helena yards and the tracks have been
torn up to a greater or less extent. A
dozen armed men were sent into the
mountains near here to-day to try to dis
cover the gang and the hiding place of a
ton of dynamite stolen here last week.
Searchers are being hired at $4 a day by
the Northern Pacific.
This Pat Crowe mode of obtaining
money was presented to the company
officials about three weeks ago. but the
facts have Just become -public. The no
tice, which was sent to General Pas
senger Agent Fee and General Manager
Hannaford, at first demanded $25,000, and
then ordered that $50,000 be given to -the
engineer of a light engine, to be delivered
by him at a designated point west of Gar
rison on a certain day and at a giv*n sig
nal from the bandits.
HELENA, Mont., Sept. 26.â Because the
Northern Pacific Railroad Company re
fuses to comply with the demands of a
gang of dynamiters to deposit a large sum
of money at a point between Garrison

have been made within the past two

"I do not want to start the innovation, but If some one would start it I would

She's more than that, she's eighty-four. The poor old lady has one foot in tha
grave. Do you think I am her rival? I didn't know the newspapers out West
printed silly things. Just like New York papers, but I guess they do.
"Why, is it that newspapers print such silly things continuously about society
people and Newport and Harry Lehr? Harry Lehr.is a very ordinary man. I
mean that he is very unusual person. He Is Just Uke anybody else. I was at
places where, it is said, he had monkeys as guests and I didn't see any monkeys.
I never saw that bracelet and purse the papers said he wore on his wrist and I

this morning there was a young man here who asked me if It was true that the
Astor baby had a golden cradle."
Mrs. Fish, who had punctuated her remarks with hearty laughter, seemed
particularly amused at the golden cradle story.
"American women ought to go into politics." said she. "they are so clever it
is a shame for them to have their brains on society. Did you ever stop to think
how much Influence women In high position could have In political affairs if she
devoted her abilities to them? Why don't I go Into politics? I have been trying
to for two years. No, I wouldn't go to the polls as they now are and vote in a
booth attached to the rear of some saloon and neither should respectable men.
Such 'things should be changed. Some day conditions will be altered and then
women will be able to rote and retain their self respect. Women should take
part in the important affairs of the time and use their power for the good of

This marks the realization of scientists'
"dreams"â a" light that' will" h'ave .all. the"
qualities of the sun's rays. So wonderful
is the light, so devoid of heat, so beauti

in any element of danger under any and
all conditions, that scientific men have
unhesitatingly pronounced it perfection-
Several ' oculists have even" declared that
the new light is less harmful to the eye
than nature's illumination itself.
The inventor of this light, the introduc
tion of which promises to effect a greater
amount of invested capital than any oth'er
invention of the age, is D. McFarlane
Moore,. a native, of Pennsylvania, and for
a time' a Â¦ student in Lehiga University.

Colonel Blake to-day charged that cer

are, he asserts, traitors to the Irish cause
and have been since tho inception of the

file of the clan the tribute of saying they
are honest and Sincere.
"The members of the clan have been
deluded and betrayed," he said, "and are

organization. I boldly charge that cer
tain leaders had an understanding with
Joseph Chamberlain when he visited the
United States on the eye, of the war. It

TRAITORS INJURE
TRE IRISH CAUSE
Mrs. Shields had just returned from Og
den, where she was a delegate from this
county to the Irrigation- Congress. She
had charge of the Sacramento County ex
hibit at the Atlanta Exposition and has
been foremost in all movements looking
to the Improvement of horticulture In this
county. She was a member of the Cali
tornia Promotion Committee of San Fran
cisco and of the State Board of Trade
and was well known all over the State.
Â¦-'â¢ At.- 12:30 o'clock"' to-night word was re
ceived from the hospital that Mrs. Shields
had expired. It was found on her arrival
there that she was suffering from internal
hemorrhages. Her son's injuries did hot
appear to be dangerous, but he was too
dazed to give an account of the, accident.
From a passenger on the car* It was
learned that Mrs. Shields and. her son
were unable to get out of the way of the
car in time, evidently not hearing the
warning bell.
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 26.â Mrs. Eliza
beth Shields, mother of Superior Judge
Peter J. Shields and one of the most
prominent orchardists in Sacramento
County, met her death in an accident to
night. Her son. Robert Shields, received
serious injuries in the same accident.
Mrs. Shields and- her son were driving
along Twenty-eighth* street to-hjght.when
they came into collision with- aistreetcar,
which was going- at a high rate of speed.
Mother and^ son were thrown forcibly to
the gTOund 'and when they inirc picked
up and conveyed to the Sisters' : Hospital,
a few : blocks away, it was found that
both were seriously injured.

LION ESCAPES
FROM TRAINERS
The two men hid in the woods until
dark and then advanced cautiously to
where a faint candle light showed
through tho window. Tiptoeing carefully
to the window the Sheriff could hear men
talking. They made a rush and caught
the fugitive unprepared.
Thinking- he would go to his brother's
ranch for shelter and food, the Sheriff
made his way to the place yesterday af
ternoon, accompanied by a deputy.
The Sheriff learned several days ago
that the fugttive's real name is Hamlln,
instead of Burke, and that he has a
brother living in the woods six miles
from Vancouver.
The Sheriff grot thÂ« drop on Burks whll*
the fugitive's runs and ammunition were
laid aside. Despite the "fact that he was
looking down the muzzle of the' officer* a
Elx-ehooter. Burk* uttered a curse and
bolted for liberty. A ball was sent
through his left arm and another through
his right thigh.
In this unhappy plight he struggled pit
ifully against capture. This final display
of desperation was characteristic of the
man's demeanor since his capture for for
gery and his subsequent escape from Jail.
Had he gt>t hold of a gun or been warned
of the Sheriff's approach a pitched battle
would have ensued.
PORTLAND, Or.. Sept. 28.â J. H. Burke,
the desperate escaped prisoner from Hills

see â¢ four, liats,":belonglng apparently to a
man, a woman and two little girls, float

was horrified to discover r the' body of- a
littie child floating , near the Â« bank ' and
went, to inform the nearest forest guard
A crowd collected, "and, with the help
of a pole, the body of tne child was taken
out . of the pool. It was that of a little
girl about 2 years old. On, further search
four more bodies strung together by cords
were : taken â¢ out-, of the pool. J They â¢ were
those of a man, a woman about 33 years

"Such men as you," he said, addressing
the prisoner, "are dangerous to be at

Sutton, In which he declares as unconsti

islation and therefore in conflict with the
provisions of the constitution. Â»
The new law provided that in case a
divorce Is feranted an interlocutory decree
should be issued, and that one year should
elapse from the time of the finding of
facts and conclusions of law before enter-
Ing judgment. This was Intended to pre
vent divorced persons from going Into
other States and remarrying before the
elapse of one year from the date of the
decree of divorce. The old law prohibited
divorced persons from remarrying in the
State until the elapse of one year.

Mr. Spinney was attended In his last Ill

quaintance. He came to this city seven
months ago for treatment for a complica

was hemorrhages of the stomach. Mr.
Spinney is survived' by a son and a

The fight took place at Fernle. Milne
Is an American and came recently from
Butte f Mont. Milne and Fitzgerald met
on the street early this morning, Just af
ter the former had come oft work In the
night shift of the coal mine. They had
several drinks in a saloon and then got
into a quarrel about the Boer war.
Milne declared that the British were
cowards and that King Edward was no
bettor than the others. Fitzgerald
promptly began to fight, but he and Milne
were separated by friends. An hour later
Fitzgerald secured a long butcher knife
and came back to renew the dispute. He
sought out Milne and forced the Ameri
can to his knees, but Milne declined to
obey his command to repeat "God save
the ICIng" three times. Fitzgerald stabbed
him in the breast and stomach five times.

His losses in business were numerous,
and his holdings at the time of his death
were of little value. His illness was of
long standing and he had been under con
stant medical treatment for several years.
Spinney's climb down the ladder was as
rapid as his ascent and dates from his
fir.3t venture into politics. Despite his
property and his big business undertak
ings, he could neither read nor write, but
he had much native shrewdneaa, and It
was this, coupled with his political meth
ods, that got him elected a member of
the Board of City Trustees. He was then
elected to the chairmanship of the Trus
tees, which constituted him the city's
Mayor, and all the city ordinances print
ed at the time were signed "Joseph Spin
ney, his mark.' 1 Afterward, however, he
learned to write his name.
He was elected Trustee three times, but
when he attempted to run for County
Supervisor he was overwhelmingly de

FRESNO, Sept. 26.â Joseph Spinney, a
former Mayor and once one of the wealth
iest men In Fresno and by far the most
unique figure ever known In local politics,
died this morning at San Francisco after
a long Illness.
Spinney was a native of Cadiz, Spain,
and came to this country when he was
about 12 years old. It was In April, 1877,
that he first came to Fresno, where he
established a brickyard. Everything for
a time seemed to turn to money for him.
He planted a slxteen-acre vineyard close
to town, he built a three-story brick
building in the business section, he pur
chased a wheat ranch of 640 acres, he
erected rows of cottages and became a
stockholder in the First National, Fresno
National, Fresno Loan and Savings and
People's Savings banks. He was also a
stockholders in the Belmont Street Car
Company. ., j

John TVarnes, a hatchtender employed
on the ship Carondolet, now unloading at
Howard-street pier No. 3, waa instantly
killed last evening by being struck on the
head with a case of salmon. A sling of

Ing, loosening the rope and causing one
of the boxes to fall from the sling, fifteen
feet above the deck. Warnes was struck
on the head and sustained a fractured

instantaneously. The Coroner's 'office

under the. management of Vice-Grand
Mrs. Peterson, Miss Emma Grennlger and
Frederick Slebe, the latter acting as mas
ter of amusement and then floor manager.
These two entertainments will realize
a neat sum for the home.
Federal officials are a unit in giving
the greatest credit to the cleverness and
acumen of Special Secret Service Agent
William J. Burns, who has handled the
substitution scandal throughout and to
whom is attributed the conclusive dis
closure of the plot and the apprehension
of all concerned in it. To him has fallen
the task of securing confessions from the
suspected men, and po well has he per
formed his work that every one with the
exception of Horn Toon has, detailed his
part In the criminal work. Without these
confessions it Is doubtful whether a single
conviction could have been secured. By
Gamble's suicide the only witness against
them was .removed and the statements
made in his confession would have proved
flimsy evidence upon which to ask Tor
convictions.
Hackman Tom Martin has been exon
erated bv the Federal officials for any
criminal intent when he represented that
the Chinamen he carried In his hack to
the Mall dock were taken by him from
the County Jail. He made this statement
at. the reauest of Gamble, who told him
that there was some Informality connect
ed with the delivery and it would save
him (Gamble) trouble if this story were
told. When Martin realized the serious
ness of the matter he went to Gamble
and insisted that the truth should be
told to Marshal Shine. Gamble agreed
to meet Martin at 3 o'clock on the,after
noon on the -Sunday following the dis
covery of the substitution and go with
him to Shine's house, where a clean breast
would be made of the matter. Gamble
failed to keep the appointment and Mar
tin went to Shine's house. alone and told
what he knew of the substitution busi
ness. This was the first circumstance
that weakened Shine's faith in the hon
esty of his subordinate. '
Yesterday morning, however, Wong Tin
was shown the photographs of Dasha,
Burnett and Dempsey and also one of
Gamble, and he identified all four as the
ones he had been In the habit of doing
business with in the substitution matter.
Dempsey proved to be the man the faulty
description of whom gave rise to the sus
picion that others at .the County Jail
had been engaged in the substitution plot.
United States Marshal Shine gave out
the statement yesterday at noon that no
more white men were implicated in the
scandal. United States District Attorney
Woodworth refused positively to corrob
orate this statement and Intimated that
further arrests of white men would fol
low. From other sources it was learned
that the arrest of the three lawyers and
their two agents had been practically
decided uDon.
Wong Tin was taken before United
States Commissioner Ileacock yesterday
and his preliminary hearing set for next
Tuesday morning. Both he and his ac
complice, Horn Toon, remain in the City
Prison in default of $3000 bail.
MARTIN EXONERATED.
IDENTIFIES GTJTLTY ONES.
It is finally settled that no more, offi
cials, either State, municipal or Federal,
are implicated in the substitution work.
When Wong Tin made his confession Fri
day nisht he gave a description of a
man connected with the County Jail as
being one of those who took an active
part in delivering the substituted China
men, and this did not correspond with
that of Dasha, Dempsey or Bur
nett. The conclusion was at once reached
that another watch had been engaged In
this unlawful traffic, as it would be im
possible for one Jailer to handle the whole
matter.
Three well known attorneys who make
a specialty of Chinese business are in
volved in the Chinese substitution scan
dal. The investigation has developed their
connection with the case almost beyond
a doubt and their arrest may be looked
for any day. It has always been thought
that these attorneys laid ' the plans for
the substitution, but it has proved ex
ceedingly difficult to fasten on thÂ«m ac
tive complicity in the crimes.
With the confession of Wong Tin the
Federal officials believe they are In a
fair way to secure the much desired evi
dence that will result in the conviction
of these prime plotters in the unlawful
game. .It is understaod that the China
man arrested Friday gave information
that if true will warrant the issuance
of warrants. The investigation has now
narrowed down to a corroboration of the
statements made by the Chinaman and
on the outcome of this will depend wheth
er or not further arrests will be made.

Dyed in the yarn j
Not printed
â¢ : You can get carpets nowadays for almost any
price you want to pay. Brussels, Velvets, Axminsters,
and even the luxurious Wiltons are imitated â and
right cleverly, too â by a class of goods, the patterns of
which are PRINTED on the surface, just like so much
calico. It is needless to say that these patterns â pro-
duced by printing â are only on the surface and some-
times wear off long before the carpet itself is worn
through. When new, and viewed on the floor, it is
hard to tell printed carpets from genuine dyed in the
3'arn goods. But pick up an end and double it over
with your fingers and â presto! the imitation is ap-
parent.
The colors of genuine dyed in the yarn carpets
go clear through to the back and the patterns will not
become broken by wearing off on the surface.
There is not a single piece, nor a single yard of
printed carpet on the Breuner Carpet Floor. We
therefore can and WILL guarantee every inch of car-
pet we sell to be genuine dyed in the yarn goods.
Look over these prices, then look at the goods
and compare the QUALITIES with the "wonderfully
cheap" offerings of the department stores who continue
to shout in sensational type the bugaboo cry of "trust â
combine," etc.

Kozy Klo â¬fs ifor^^^^CMldren
The shoe that the child wears plays an important part in the
future foot comfort of the grown up. Little, growing feet are ten-
der and very susceptible to the bad effects of poor fitting shoes.
In the Kory KIor we have a shoe that is built with due regard
for the shape and growing conditions of the child's foot. The
Kozy Klog last has the broad toes, giving plenty of growing room.
It makes the shoe fit perfectly over the instep, gently holding it
in proper place, no matter if the wearer is walking or standing.
These splendid easy-fitting qualities tend to make this shoe wear
longer.
As to prices they are no higher than you pay for ordinary
shoes made on indifferent or ill-shape lasts.
They range from $1.25 up to $350 a pair, according to age and
material. _ .V.'J Â«'
We have so much confidence in the Kozy Klogs for children > â¢

Battleship Maine Sails for Culebra.
PHILADELPHIA. Sept. 25.â The battle
ship Slidne to-day passed down the Dela
ware Mhner from the League Island navy
yard en her vovasre to Culebra, in the
West Indies. The Maine was recently re
paired at Cramp's shipyards. Upon her
arrival at Culebra the battleship's guns
are to be 'horoughly tested and If they
are satisfaeory the Maine will start on
a long cruise
The accident was caused by the break
ing of the trusses which supported the
steel girders. When these fell the south
half of the roof fell in upon about two
score workmen, injuring nearly half of
them. About 250 were employed In other
parts of the building and the crash caused
a patlc among them. Several sustained
slight injuries In Jumping- from thÂ© win

WASHINGTON, Sept 25.â Unless the
differences between Colombia and the
Central and South American Telegrapn
Company are adjusted by October 1. It Is
probable that on that date the company
wlll close !ts office at Buena Ventura,
v.-hlch operates the Colombian end of the
cable. Dr. Herran, the Colombian Charge
d'Affaires, said to-night that he had re
fused to sign a new contract for twenty
years renewing the concession of the telc
craph company owing to a provision
which, if accepted, would grant to the
company certain privileges amounting to
a monopoly. The company, however. In
sisting upon the signing of thÂ© contract
without change, has submitted the mat
ter to the officials at Bogota, where it ia
now under consideration. The present
contract does not expire until August, 1904.
DR. Tl kk.ti.a-w REFUSES
TO HENEW CONCESSION
Colombian Charge d' Affaires Says
Cable Company Is Seeking- to
Secure a Monopoly.
Bookkeeper Martin to-nigrht is resting
more comfortably and the "physicians at
the W2.Ehir.gt0n Hospital say his condi
tion Is favorable, but he has not passed
thÂ© critical stage.
The abandoned mine oa the Patterson
farm, near the Ecene of' the tragedy,
which was supposed to have been used as
a refuge by the- criminals, was closely
guarded all right, and this morning- It
was thoroughly explored, without any
evidence being- discovered that the men
had been hiding there.
Early to-day John "Welsh, a resident of
West Middletown, found the satchel In
which Contractor Ferruson had carried
the money. It was rifled of thÂ© roll of
bills, amounting to 53300. Some twenty
dollars In ellver was left In it; also some
valuable papers.
Manager Norton of the Ferguson Com
pany does not believe that the suspects
under arrest committed the deed, but is
confident that they know something about
it. He is of the impression that it was
committed by men employed in the camp
and that the guilty ones are remaining in
the camp in order not to excite suspicion.
The dead man was one of the best
known railroad contractors in the coun
try- IIÂ© 'was associated with his brother,
F. M. Ferguson, in the Ferguson Con
tracting Company, the latter brother be
ing- president of the company. The Fer-
Ruson family came originally from Kan
fas, and a great deal of railway work
has been done in the West by the Fergu
son company. :
ThÂ© only description of the man who
was seen by Farmer Logout carrying the
eatchel away from ths spot where the
dynamite was exploded is meager. It is
a* follows: "White man, about 25 yeaj-s
of age, five feet six inches tall, weight
about 140 to 143 pounds, fairly well
dressed: wore soft black hat, dark coat
and llgrht trousers. This description, has
been sent out broadcast.
VTABHIXGTON". Pa., Sept. 25.â TbÂ© day
has dosed without the apprehension of
the fiendish murderer or murderer* of
â¢Contractor Fersruson, who was killed by
the explosion of a. mine of c!yna_mitÂ© near
Jliddletown yesterday. The suspects,
Francis and Huston, under arrest are not.
It Is believed, the guilty principals, but
evlder.ee has been obtained which tends
to Implicate them In the crime. The pre
vailing opinion seems to be that they
were used as tools by the real perpetra
tors. Their stories of the manner in
v.hich they spent yesterday have been
proved Incorrect In several points, and
until they can prove an absolute alibi
they vHI be held by the authorities.
The day In and around the camp has
been characterized by a determined qu!et.
"What amounts to martial law has been
declared at Camp Ferguson by General
Manager Norton, Sheriff Carothers and
the County Commissioners and a strict
Â¦watch Is being: kept over. the 1700 work
men because of the belief that the lead
er of the plct may not have escaped. As
an Incentive for the capture of the gruilty
ones the Ferguson Construction Company
has offered a reward of $1000. To this
thÂ» County Commissioner has added an
toher $1000 and an cddiUor.ul $500 Is being
raised by individual subscription.

LONDON, Sept 26.â The British Foreign
Office In , denying the. statement of the
Paris correspondent of Daily Mail
that Great Britain, and Spain had agreed
to the establishment of a French [ pro
tectorate over Morocco characterizes the
story as "groundless nonsense."
PARIS. Sept 26.-The French Foreign
Office declares that any negotiations with
Great Britain on the subject of Morocco
do not go beyond the question of a gen
eral good understanding. The officials
flatly deny that France Is entertaining
schemes for a protectorate over or a con
quest of Morocco, and express surprise at
the persistence of the press reports at
tributing euch plans to France and as
serting that Great Britain's consent has
been purchased by concessions In Egypt.
The utmost that could happen in the case
of certain eventualities would be that
France would exercise her right of as
sisting the Sultan In pollcelng the fron
tier district. . ;

THE PROTECTORATE STORY
LONDON, Eept v 26.â The report pub-t
lished in the United States that Sir Fred
erick Trevis, surgeon in ordinary to the
King, had been summoned to Balmoral
to attend King Edward and that alarm
had been caused thereby Is incorrect. Sir
Frederick was not summoned to Balmoral.
He went there on a personal visit to the
King which is so far removed from any
urgent professional summons that the
London papers of Thursday last an
nounced that "Sir Frederick Trevis will
leave for Balmoral on a' visit to the King
Saturday." --- ; " ; ;
Sir Frederick, who was surgeon in or
dinary to his Majesty when he was Prince
of Wales, has kept up a keen friendship
for the sovereign, and has Joined the
party at Balmoral, which to-night In
cludes the Earl of Kllmorey, one of. his
Majesty's most genial friends'of boyhood.
They spent this afternoon watching a
cricket match. Yesterday- afternoon the
King undertook a long and trying deer
drive. During tho week his Majesty ex
hibited the best health and spirits, divid
ing his time between strenuous outdoor
life and discussions with Premier Balfour
and others regarding the composition of
the new Cabinet.
Sir Frederick Trevis has retired from
the practice of his profession.
Report That Sir Frederick Trevis
"Was Summoned to Attend Him
Is Incorrect.

the situation appears to remain un

of policy.

SOFIA, Bulgaria, Sept. 26.â The person
nel of the Sultan's new Macedonian com
mission Is alleged here to be an Indication
of the insincerity of thÂ« Porte's inten
tions. The Bulgarian representative,
Nicola Rebuff, a member of the court of
Justice at Monaetir, is 80 years of age and
has been for many years an official . of
the Turkish Government With the ex
ception" of Hilmi Pasha, tha Inspector
General, who Is president of the commis
sion, none of the others has any prom
inence or Influence. The fact that the

show that the Porte has not accepted

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL
Tew People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty.
Xearla everybody knows that charcoal Is the
cafest and most efficient disinfectant and pur-
ifier In nature, but few realize its value when
taken Into the human eystem for the tame
cleansing purpose.
Charcoal Is a remedy that the more you take
of It the better; It Is not a drug at all. but
ilmply absorbs the erases and Impurities always
present In the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them out of the system.
Charcoal eweetens the breath after smoking,
drinking or after eating onions and other odor-
ous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Improves the
complexion. It whitens the teeth and further
acts as a natural and eminently safe cathartic
It absorbs the Injurious gases which collect 1
in the ttoraach and bowels; it disinfects the
raouth and throat from the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal In one form or an-
other, but probably the best charcoal and the
most for the money is in Stuart's Absorbent
Lozenges; they are composed of the finest pow.
<2ered Willow charcoal, and other harmless an-
tiseptics In tablet form or rather In the form
of large, pleasant tasting lozenges, the charcoal
being mixed with honey.
The daily use of .these lozenges will soon
tell in a much improved condition of the gen-
eral health, better complexion, sweeter breath
and purer blood, and the beauty of It is that
no possible harm can result from their con-
tinued use, but on the contrary, great benefit
A Buffalo physician in .speaking of the bene-
fits of charcoal says: "I advise Stuart's Ab-
eorbent Lozenges to all patients Buffering from
gas in stomach and bowels, and to clear the
complexion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver Is greatly bene-
fited by the dally use of them; they cost but
twenty-five cents a box at drug stors. and al-
though In some echf* a patent preparation, j-ct
I believe I get more and better charcoal in
Stuart'* Absorbent Lozenges than in any of
the ordinary charcoal tablets."

BERLIN. Sept. 55.â Corruption in the

to-day of Herman Baganz, secretary of
WASHINGTON. Sept. 26.â Through an
opinion prepared by Assistant, Attorney
General Campbell, the Secretary of the
Interior has rendered a final decision in
the case of Morrow,' and others vs. the
State of Oregon and the Warner L.ive-
Btock Company, involving *a large tract of
land claimed under the swamp lands
lawn. The decision directs/the Issuance
of a patent. Tho caso has been before
the department for twenty years and has
attracted much attention.
Morrow and his associates attacked the
application on the ground that the land
involved was not swamp land, but in a
decision delivered last May the depart
ment held that it was. The present Gov
ernor of the State filed a protest against
the issuance of patent on the ground
that it could not be issued except upon
request from him. Inasmuch as two of
his predecessors had made such a request,
the department overruled his protest.

LINCOLN, Nebr., Sept. 26.â It developed
to-day that an attempt was made last
night to kidnap the 8-year-old girl of Gov
ernor Mickey. "While four of the Gov
ernor's children were playing ln front of
the mansion an unknown man came along
and tried to carry the oldest girl away.
The other children clung to his clothes
and screamed. The man was so badly
frightened when he saw neighbors com
ing that he dropped the child and ran.
Governor Mickey says that the Warden
of the penitentiary reported to him twice
that a kidnaping attempt had been
prophesied by the convicts. One convict
saicl somB.time ago that such a plan had
been formed as a way of getting revenge
upon the Governor for his refusal to In
terfere when William Rhea was hanged
last summer for murder. A convict who
had been ln the plot says a convict soon
to be released had been assigned to kid
nap one of the children to "teach the
Governor a lesson."

NEW YORK, Sept. 2S.â The Financier
eays: One notable feature of the of
ficial statement of the New York Asso
ciated Banks last week was the reduction
of $5,008,100 ln loans, making the decrease
ln this Item for the fortnight $3,530,000.
This was largely the result of liquidations
conesquent upon the decline in the stock
market, although, as noted ln the pre
vious week, the reduction In loans then j
was principally caused by operations in
cident to the pending merger of the Na
tional Bank of Commerce and the "West
ern National Bank of the United States.
The cash reserve last week decreased j
$635,300 net, which amount is considerably !
ln excess of that estimated upon the ba
sis of the traceable movements of money,
this estimate indicating a gain of $111,(500.
The Ioes of cash was chiefly caused by
the drain of money to the South through
treasury transfers to New Orleans and
direct movements to the cotton ports, j
these transfers amounting for the week
to $2,000,000. The receipt by the banks
from nearby points, caused principally by
the return of funds which had been with
drawn for the Labor day holiday use,
nearly offset the shipments to other parts
cf the country and it ls noteworthy that
the movement to the grain sections was
quiet, reflecting the tardy distribution ot
these 'crops. The deposits decreased
$8,137,100. which, sum is greater by $2,490.
400 than that called for by the reduction
ln loans and the loss of cash; therefore
the settlement is technically out of proof.
The required reserve was reduced $2,034,
275 through the decrease in deposits and
deducting therefrom the net loss of cash
leaves $1,355,675 as the increase In surplus
reserve, which now is $14,559,300. Calculated,
upon the basis of deposits. Less those of
$38.S32,S00 public funds, the surplus Is $24.-
S02.500. The circulation was increased
$319,600 last wÂ«k, making $1,815,100 since
September 25. inclusive. Loans are In ex
cess of deposits of $15,702,500. the largest
since July 11. The dally average of clear
ings during the week was $176,000,000,
against $170,00-1,000 in the previous week.
Compared with a year ago, the surplus J
reserve against all deposits is $10,000,090
greater. As above noted, this season's
movements of the grain crops is late, and
consequently the demand for money
therefor is small. If there should be an
important increase in this demand in the
near future, however, the effect upon the
bank reserves would probably not be se
rious, for these are now at an unusually
high level for the season and, moreover,
through the operation of relief measures
which have been inaugurated by Secre
tary Shaw, the treasury drain will be
minimized and the withdrawals of bal
ances by country banks will mest likely
he moderate. Comparisons of changes in
the itfm of loans show that, with the ex
ception of the two banks above named,
which are upon the eve of merger and
Â¦which reduced their loans $3,100,000, the
decreases In this item were quite uniform.
The ca.=h charges show a net loss by
seven banks of $1,600,000; three of these in
stitutions indicate a reduction of $4,700 -
I 000.
since IS76. The present grand patriarch,
J. A. Foster, was advanced by reason
of the death of the patriarch who was
elected at the Grand Encampment. He
has bfpn ln office but eight months and ln
that period he worked up an enthusiasm
that resulted in a net gain of nearly 150.
The membership of the encampment
branch at this time is 615S, in ninety-two
encampments. Of this number it is ex
pected that nearly 1000 who belong to the
military section will attend the canton
ment. In many of the Eastern States
the holding of a Grand Encampment is
merely a pro forma affair, lasting but one
day, and at which new officers are elected
and reports read, but in this State it ls
made the occasion of a week's outing for
the membership and there Is a division of
work and pleasure. The entertainment of
the visitors has been arranged for by thÂ»
Odd Fellows of Pawo Robles and by a citi

NO DANGER
There is absolutely no danger in the use of the Electro-Chemic X-Ray
treatment. If accidents occur in the use of the X-Ray, it is because of
faulty or cheap apparatus, or because the operator is careless or unskilled.
In the thousands of cases which have been treated in the offices of the
Electro-Chemic Institute there has not been a single case in which any un-
favorable result has been noted.
THE ELECTRO-CHEMIC X-RAY
Will cure Cancer, Lupus, Eczema and Consumption when there is no hope
from any other known treatment. Electro-Chemistry cures Deafness, Ring-
ing Head and Car Noises, Rheumatism, Paralysis, Locomotor Ataxia, Piles
and all diseases of the Skin and Blood, and diseases of the Stomach, Liver,
Kidneys and Bowels. It cures Special Diseases of Men and Women with-
out surgery. There are no long-drawn-out medical courses, with strong
and poisonous drugs to wear out the stomach.

Oakland has reached a critical stage in her existence. Her outgoing Grand Jury has made the
revolutionary suggestion that officials of the municipality must earn their salaries. It is to be hoped
for the sake of her peace and the permanency of her institutions that Oakland will not have the fool
hardy temerity to act upon the recommendation.
San* Francisco has a new Grand Jury. The fact is chronicled to prevent it from oblivion. Local
Grand Juries prove their existence only by the announcement that they have passed away. We are
generally made aware that such an institution is a municipal machine only when we are informed
that its term of office has expired or commenced.
The first dancing party of the season
by the Eschscholtzias, the select dancing
club of the Mission district, was given
in Mission Opera Hall on the evening of
last Thursday. There were seventy-five
couples In the grand march. It would
have been larger, but a number who had

the strict, rule of the club, that of ap

were denied admission. Henry Dowden

An American lawyer has been complimented by Lord Alverstone for the cleverness of his ar

a Judge compliments an attorney, look out for the cause represented by him who is abused or praised.
The reform Mayor of the little Illinois town of Mattoon has been indicted upon twenty-nine
counts charging malfeasance and misfeasance in office. Let the reform Mayor take solace. It is* prob
able that every one of the twenty-nine counts simply represents a different view point in the glorious
crusade of reform. The Mayor must chide himself, however, for permitting the existence of an
unsympathetic Grand Jury. <-;
A Chinese reformer has come to town. HeÂ«has 6een heralded by the blare of occidental trum

to our laws of sanitation and humanity and less murderous to themselves. Our visitor will find a
wider field for usefulness in Little China than he did in the land from which he fled.

in character and coniined to the larger
farms.
Besides the electrification of seeds to
accelerate germination, which has now
been practiced for some years, and the
protection cf the soil from insects and
worms, it has boon used, as stated above,
on larg-er farms that could afford to in
stall a. plant as the power to perform the
real h<>avy work. Electric plows have
been found to do their work better than
draft animals harnessed to the old time
share. In harvesting, too. It has been
found that work can be lightened and re
sults Improved by the judicious use of
electrically-driven apparatus. Threshing
machines, winnowing machines, saws,
pumps, etc., have been driven by electric
motors with great efficiency and econ
omy. By use of electricity the wine
grower finds that he ca.n age his wine,
the olive grower purify his oil and the
turf cutter carbonize his peat.
To bring about the more general use of
electricity in thin field and show how a
plant can be ins-tailed at small cost, says
the Scientific American, three German
firms, the Union, the Helios and Schue
kert & Co., have installed model farms, on
'which nearly ail if not nil of the work
is done by means of -electricity and meet
the case of the small farmers.
In order to cut/down expenses central
stations have been built which distribute
I he current for many miles at a very rea
sonable rate. Transformers are, of course,
necessary. For electric plows, threshing
machines and for movable agricultural
implements in general, the Helios Com
pany has designed a special portable
transformer for the purpose of stepping
down the high-teiTsion current before it is
sent to the motors. The game comjany
has recently Installed two model electric
farms, one at Quednau and the other
at Simmern.
The Quednau farm is superintended by
Professor Backhaus of the Agricultural
Institute of the I'nlverslty of Koenigs
berg. The farm is situated near Koenlgs
berg and covers about l&l hectares (447
acres). The enterprise not being very ex
tensive, a dairy is operated in conjunction
with It, the output being 10,00." liters (2200
gallons) of milk per day. The central
station comprises two divisionsâ the one a
generating plant, the other an electric
lighting plant. The power house is equip
ped with an er.sine of 50 hcrse power.
PLANS PRACTICAL TEST
OF SCIENTIFIC THEORY
Fish Commission Will Ascertain if
Steelhead and Rainbow Trout
Are Same.
The scientific theory that the steelhead
trout of Bait water is the rainbow trout
of the mountain streams is to be given a
practical test by ' Chief Deputy Charles
Vogelsang cf the Fish Commission. With
this end In view he has sent 10,000 steel
head fry to the Slsson hatchery, where
the fish will be allowed to grow to ma
turity in a separate and specially con
structed pond.
Most of the leading piscatorial scientists
hold that a difference !n environment
rauses some fry to become rainbow trout
and others steelheads. The game laws
vary In respect to the taking cf rainbow
and steclhead trout and if the test sub
stantiates the theory the statutes will
have to be altered.

We feel authorized to say, in behalf of Providence, that if Sam Lewis contributes no more
to morality and kindness than a dead cat to music, then Samuel is in trouble. The cold fact is that
Providence never put a fiddle string inside of a cat. The alimentary canal of the lowly sheep is the
substance from which riddle strings are made, and -art never attempted to make them out of the
bowels of a cat. Stradivarius owes his fame as a fiddle maker, and the great fiddlers their reputation
in music, to those two domestic animals, useful in agriculture, the sheep and the horse. It is bv draw
ing the hair of a horse over the bowels of a sheep that those harmonies are produced which have led
the Examiner to praise Providence for the anatomy of the cat.
THE Examiner has condescended to flatter Divine Providence and admits that it enables the
making of beautiful things out of strange material. As the Examiner is in the habit of mak
ing strange things out of no material at all, its evidence may be taken as that of an expert.
It Jails into dreamless contemplation of the midnight cat, full of strange noises and without
harmony in any key, running up and down the gamut of ddiance, delivered from the back fence,
and even wooing in terms that seem to be feline blasphemy and rasping as a tune played by file on
saw. And yet the Examiner sagely observes that when Divine Providence ordained the cat into ex
istence it provided for the musical violin and made possible Ole Bull, Camillo Urso, Dr. Shradv
Richardson and the other virtuosi who have resined the bow, and also enabled Mayor Schmitz to
fiddle himself into fame and office.
"Yes," says the Examiner, "you hear a cat mournfully howling on the fence, the least musical
of all created things. Part of the interior of that cat is necessary that the great violinist may pro
duce his beautiful music." Therefore mysterious are the ways of Providence, and wise. Then this
subtle flatterer of divinity digs up a usurer,- Sam Lewis, who was covetous and bad and "morally
ranked about as the backyard cat ranks musically." Yet, observes that condescending newspaper in
a patronizing tone toward Providence, "but as the cat contributes to music after death, so Sam Lewis
contributes to morality and kindness now that his body is underground/'

Music In France, as Mr. Hervey points
out. really means music In Paris, for al
though the great towns of the depart
ments have of late shown signs of an In
creasing Interest In the art, yet the capi
tal has been, and is still, the musical cen
ter of the country.
And music in Paris means chiefly
operatic music. Long-winded oratorios do
not appeal to Frenchmen. The theater is
more to their taste. The opera forms
part of the people's existence, and no
government would ever think of refus
ing to subsidize the two principal theaters
where it Is cultivated. Hence Paris has
been the birthplace of some of the most
famous operas. Many celebrated com
posers of other lands have been attracted
by the splendors of its patronage and
have brought thither the fruits of their
genius. Even Wagner himself began by
attempting the conquest of Paris.
Meanwhile French composers have ad
mirably held their own, and In late years
there has sprung up a school of musicians
admirably equipped for the fray, ready
to do honor to their country.
Arthur Hervey, iry a succinct but
satisfactory little manual has taken a
blrdseye view of the musical movement in
FrancÂ© during the last century, dwelling
chiefly on those composers whose Influ
ence has been most marked, "those who
have brought something: new into their
music and have contributed to the evo
lution of the art."

Â¦which drives a four-pole dynamo. A
current of 90 amperes at 500 volts is gen
erated. A small two-pole dynamo is em
ployed for electric lighting, the current
generated having an Intensity of 30 am
peres and a pressure of 220 volts, or an in
tensity of IS amperes and a pressure of
220 volts when it is used for charging a
Pollak storage battery of 120 volts.
The electric lighting plant Is so de
signed that the lamp capacity can be
doubled by the utilization of a secondary
dynamo. It Â¦will, however, hardly be
necessary to use supplementary lamps.
For cooking and for heating the living
rooms electricity is also used.
Three electric motors drive the agricul
tural machinery- One, having a horse
power of 2 1 ,a, is used to drive a carrot
cuttlng machine. The other, two are
portable, and can be employed as may be
desired for driving milling machinery, a
machine for crushing flaxseed, a pump, a
circular saw, a threshing machine, and
other purposes. On the Quednau farm an
electric plow is also employed.
The Simmern farm differs from that of
Quednau chiefly in the manner of gener
ating the current- Turolne driven dyna
mos are employed, the Simmern River
furnishing all the water power that can
be desired. The turbine used is of the
Beche type, and drives a Helios dynamo
of 11 kilowatts, generating a current at a
pressure cf 113 volts. Since the transmis
sion distances are not great, direct cur
rent is generated. The dyamos are also
employed to charge a Hagen storage bat
tery of C2 elements. In installing this
farm it was sought to do away with man
ual labor as much aa possible. For that
re- Km it became necessary to design mo
tors which should . be small, light and
readily portable. TTae Simmern farm has
two such motors. The first is of 10 horse
power and has a voltage of 110, with a
speed of 3200 revolutions per minute.
When mounted on wheels it usually
drives four small machines, namely, a
carrot-cutting machine having an output
of COO kilogrammes (1518 pounds) an hour;
a machine for crushing flaxseed having
an output of 500 kilogrammes (1100
pounds) an hour; a straw-cutting ma
chine having a capacity of 190 kilo
grammes (418 pounds) an hour, and a
pump. By means of a fast and loose pul
ley, the four machines can be set in
operation at once or can be worked Inde
pendently. The same motor also drives a
threshing machine, having an output of
900 kilogrammes (19S0 pounds) an hour.
The second motor is fastened to a bed
; board and is portable. It has a horse
power of three quarters and drives a cen
trifugal cream separator having a ca
pacity of 430 liters of milk per hour, or a
mechanical winnower placed In the wheat
bin.
SAYS TELEGRAPH HILL
SHOULD BE PRESERVED
TWO ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES IX T.'SE OX A MODEL FARM. SHOW
ING SOME OF THE PHASES OF WORK DONE WITH ELECTRICITT
AS THE MOTIVE POWER.
The laborers who were ordered to strike admitted that tl: ere was no reason for it, and that
they were not informed of the cause of the order which stopped their work and wages. When
Parks was asked why the men were in ignorance of the reason of his strike order, iie answered,
"I shut them fellers' mouths, and if one of them talks he'll never get another day's work while I'm in
New York." This meant that the penalty for questioning his order and authority would be expul
sion from the union and denial of the right to earn a living.
That is an awful power to hold over the destiny of men. It is practically the claim by Parks
of the right to condemn men to death for disobedience of his ordejs. To uphold such a man, con
victed of a felony as he is, and to submit willingly to his autocratic dictation, and to treat as legiti
mate his power to paralyze the industries of the country, are matters of the keenest interest to
everybody. There can be but one end to such a condition and that is the withdrawal of investments,
the check of all industry, the "sequestration of capital, the disuse of labor and the cessation ot
its wages.
The country is receiving an enormous foreign immigration, and the alien laborers it brings
are immediately absorbed into labor unions, and in their ignorance of our country and institutions
they are taught, as their first lesson, that the power of such men as Parks is here supreme. They
are immediately led to deny to American youth the right to acquire a trade and to exclude them
from unions if they learn a handicraft in a technical school, and to kill them if they attempt to earn
a living by following an occupation so acquired. Of all this Mr. Parks is the most prominent repre
sentative and chosen leader. It has been announced by his supporters that even from his cell in the
penite'ntiary to which he is sentenced he will continue his leadership and his power will remain un
broken and his authority supreme.
His victory over Buchanan and the moderates will greatly enhance his importance and in
crease his following. His policy is radical to the extreme. His followers admit that he ordered
strikes without cause,- compelled them to break contracts without scruple, and took enormous bribes
from employers, which went into his own pocket as the price of his permission to resume business.
But they announce that they are not impressed by the moral aspect of such conduct>nor by its effect
upon the industrial condition of the country. They say they want a man of that kind, who can put
employers, investors and contractors under tribute. It will be remembered that a few months ago
the union labor of this city was told, in a half sermon and half harangue in Metropolitan Temple,
this significant thing: "Remember that no man in the United States has a right to invest a dollar
in business except by your consent and on your conditions." ?
To enforce that fateful declaration just such a man as Mr. Parks is necessary. His policy is
the energetic application of that statement. He is the embodiment of the principle it laid down, and
he has the daring and the vigor to enforce it.
Perhaps it may be said that the law should interfere in the protection of the rights of person
and property, which are assailed and smitten destructively by such a use of physical force. This'
raises the question whether the Government, that is to say the law, has a potency equal to the de
fense of such rights against such form of attack.
THE triumph of Mr. Sam Parks, walking delegate of the Housesmiths' and Bridgemen's
/Union, would ordinarily be of no interest to the general "public. But the circumstances invest
it with significance which no genuine American citizen can ignore. He has prevailed inÂ» the
national convention of his union, over President Buchanan and the moderate party, who be
lieve that, to be permanent and useful, labor organizations must remain in line with the interests of
the community, and, above all, must not be arrayed against the moral sense of the people.
In pursuance of that belief President Buchanan suspended the , local union of which Parks is
the head, on the ground that lie had been convicted of a felony, that his union condoned his offense
and insisted on putting him forward as a worthy representative o? union labor. . Even this view of it
would only concern the general public through its interest in the rr.ajesty of the law and the need of
supporting its administration under all circumstances. The real point at which the public is touched
is in the power of Parks, used heretofore and to be used hereafter, to block the industrial operations
of the whole country. This has been done by ordering strikes without reason or cause, in cases in
which the employers had made contracts with the unions ruled by Parks and had kept those con
tracts in letter and spirit.

BICHABBSON'S BIT.
The sum total received by the company
from the Government wai $30,075 for the
7100 machines. . Richardson's salary as
president and manager of the company
was $75 per month and Espey's salary
as secretary from January 1, UM1 was
$50 per month. This Included* the rent of
the company's desk room In Espey's of
fice In the Mills building.
With reference to Mr. Erwln's relations
with the company, the witness stated that
Mr. Erwin had not been authorized by
the company to do anything about the
sale of the Indicators when he went to-
Washington- with Richardson. Richard
son held 11,000 shares of the stock of
which he sold 4000 to his friends and oth
ers. In addition Richardson drew down
$2200. as salary as president and $1500 as
dividends, i A man named Seeger held
1000 shares, said the witness, and he had
not paid anything for them. They had
been primarily Issued to Mr. Hoagland,
one of the Inventors, and he had trans
ferred them to Seeger. The witness had
Â¦not been Informed that Seeger was hold
ing: the stock for Machen. He did not
know that Machen held any stock. The
witness was positive that McDonough did
and hold any stock, and the same was
true of Beavers. ' He had heard that Rich
ardson had transferred some of his stock
to McDonouBh, but it was never trans
ferred on the books of the company. He
added that- 4000 additional indicators had
been furnished by the company to the
Government, but had not been paid for'
An adjournment was taken until Mon
day at 10 a. m. y
the United States Government was $4 for
the smallest size and *4 25 and $4 50 for
the other sizes, the aggregate being $30,075
paid by the United States. The New
Zealand Government paid $6 50 each for
the devicesâ the larffe size, No. 3. Pour
thousand additional indicators he said
had been furnished to the United States
Government, for which the Government
had not yet paid the company.'
Â¦ In reply to a question by Mr. Knight,
the witness said that the total cost to
the Postal Device Company for each ma
chine was 53 33.7. This cost Included the
cost of the material, the services by the
manufacturer and mechanics In supervis
ing the work, the subsequent erection of
the boxes, officers' and employes' salary.
Incidental and office expenses and Inter
est. The Interest Item had been Incurred
by the default of the Government for a
year and a half in paying for the boxes.
Omitting salaries and some other Items,
the expense at the factory was $2 71
each.

Theobald Pleads Guilty.
George W. Theobald pleaded guilty yes
terday In the United States District Court
to an indictment charging: him with steal
ing mail matter out of letter boxes. He
â¢was ordered to appear for sentence next
Tuesday.
Robert R. Munro was then called. He
testified that he was the postofflce in
spector in charge for the northern dis
trict of California and that he had made
the complaint on the indictment solely
and not upon his own knowledge. He had
drawn the complaint, he said, by virtue of
his office alone.
R. H. E. Espey testified that he was
and had been secretary of the Postal De
vice and Improvement Company since De
cember, 1899^ the date of its organiza
tion. Mr. Erwin was not and never had
been an officer or director of the original
Montague Company or of the Postal De
vice and ' Improvement Company. The
company gave Mr. Efwln 600 shares for
his services in perfecting the device and
in making suggestions as to the needs of
the department, concerning the mechanism
of the time indicator. He did not ask
for any stock and his suggestions were
purely voluntary. Richardson and Mr.
Hoagland were both anxious that Er*win
should be remunerated for his services in
perfecting the mechanism of the device.
ERWIN'S SMALL DRAWDOWN.
There were two patents Issued, the first
before the time indicating device had been
perfected, and the second covering some
Improvements that Mr. Erwin had sug
gested. Erwin received dividends aggre
gating $96. and that is all that he ever
got out of the stock. Of the time indi
cator boxes 7100 were sold to the United
States Government and 100 to the New
Zealand Government. The price paid by
In reply to Mr. Woodworth the witness
said that he did not mention to any one
the fact that Mr. Machen or Mr. Beavers
had any stock, because he did not know
that it was contrary to law.
This closed the cross-examination and
Mr. Knight proceeded with the redirect
examination. In reply to questions by
Mr. Knight, Mr. Erwin stated that he
was not sufficiently familiar with the
business of the Postal Device and Im
provement Company to speak ol it to
Mr. Machen and that was the reason why
he had Mr. Richardson furnish him with
a memorandum, which he handed to
Machen. The witness understood that
Richardson had been a director in the
original Montague Company and for the
past year and a half president and gen
eral manager of the Postal Device Com
pany. "
HONORABLE INTENTIONS.
The witness said that he had not been
aware of the existence of the law until
within the past two or three months, and
that was why he had not reported the
matter or made any Investigation what
ever.
000 and the deprivation of the right to
hold office under the Government forever
thereafter.
The witness said that he had a suspi
cion for the paÂ§t two years that stock
had been issued to Beavers and Machen.
That surmise was based on what Rich
ardson had told him. Richardson had
been complaining that Mr.- Machen was
not answering letters that had been sent
to him by the company, and he, Richard
son, said that he wondered whether Ma
chen and Beavers didn't want some more
stock. The witness did not interest him
self in the matter and made no inquiries,
but from what Richardson said he sur
mised that stockhad been issued to Ma
chen and" Beavers. Witness did not know
at tha time that the giving of i stock to
Machen and Beavers was a violation of
the law.
Mr. Woodworth read the statute prohib
iting the giving of anything to a Govern
ment official or member of Cqngress for
the purpose of having any contract made
with the Government.' The penalty for
giving or receiving such bribe was impris
onment for two years and a fine of flO,-
The witness, continuing, said that it
was at the urgent solicitation of the post
master at Sacramento that he wrote to
the department recommending the use of
the time Indicators in Sacramento, and
that not more than 100 werl sent there.
The witness never heard of any other
similar invention, except one in the East,
which was to be set by the carrier him
self and was not automatic In any sense.
Mr. Richardson had Informed him with
in two or three months past that some
1000 shares had been issued in the name
of Harry Seeger and that they were In

SACRAMENTO GETS THEM.
On May 31, 1900, I left San Francisco again
for Washington to Inquire into the reason for
the delay of the Government in adopting the
device and I took a memorandum which Mr.
Richardson handed me. â¢ He complained that he
couldn't get answers to his letters to the de
partnlent concerning this device and he re
quested me to go to Washington and make the
inquiries as suggested by his memorandum.
We had found that the cost of the larger sizes
of the device was greater than the company
had figured, and Richardson proposed that $4,
f 4 50 and $5 should be the prices charged the
Government for the different sires, but it was
afterward cut down to $4, $4 25 and $4 50 for
the different sizes, beginning with the smallest.
I gave Mr. Machen Mr. Richardson's memo
randum. Among other things in a memoran
dum was . a request from Mr. Richardson to
Mr. Machen to order 1000 of the devices.
After arriving in Washington I sent a tele
gram on June 12. 1000. conveying to Richard
son the same Information officially conveyed to
him by the First Assistant Postmaster General.
1 received a letter from him when I waa in Jer
sey City. It read: â¢'Tour telegram received.
Good!" Then he wanted me to ask Machen to
have the people at Reading fit up one of tha
boxes and forward it as a working sample.
I have no recollection of having done any
thing In these matters since June, 1900. On
July 1, 1900. I received orders from the depart
ment to proceed to Manila. The first of the de
vices was not Installed until later In that year.
My trip to Manila occupied 105 days, and I did
not assume the duties of, my new position until
I returned about the first or second of Novem
ber of that year.
RICHARDSON COMPLAINS.
. I believe the first 7000 time Indicators -were
made in Reading. Pa.,, and perhaps 1100 were
sent, to this coast. I fcelieve. that they .were
first installed late in 1900 in San Francisco.
Mr. Richardson's estimate was that the device
could be sold to the department for about' four
dollars .apieceâ rtliat was simply his estimate aÂ«
to the probable cost That was also the price
named in the contract for the 7000 devices.
The actual cost of making the device to the
Postal Device and â¢ Improvement Company waa
about $3 33 each. I received fifty shares of
Etock in the original company, a short time be
rore we left for Washington, but I do not re
member the exact date, liy fifty were ex
changed for 100 of the new company's and I
was given 500 more. The company paid my
expenses for the time I was engaged in doing
this work for them. Mr. Richardson, who was
with me, paid my expenses. I presented my
claims to the Government for the expenses
due me in the Government work. I was not
paid anything- for my services. What I did
was an act of friendship for Mr. Richardson.
I do not know that Mr. Machen received any
stock or ever held any interest In the Mon
tague Letter-box -Device Company or in the
Postal Device and Improvement Company. Nor
do I know that Mr. Beavers received any stock
inelther of these' companies.
' "What was the rule or method for ac
quiring a patent device for the. Govern*
ment?" asked Mr. Woodworth.
. "I. could not say. I do not know," waa
the reply.
Mr. Erwin continued:
MACHINES INSTALLED.
Another day will conclude thÂ© Judicial
Investigation by United States Court
Commissioner Heacock Into the Federal
indictment charging J. "W. Erwin with
conspiring- to defraud the United States
Government by inducing It to make an ex
clusive contract with the Postal Device
and Improvement Company for the pur
chase at an exhorbitant price of time in
dicators for street letter boxes. Mr. Er
win's examination was concluded before
noon j'esterday and at noon the examina
tion was continued until 10 a. m. to
morrow.
The result of Mr. Erwln's examination
was the establishment of the following
facts: That Daniel S. Richardson, super
intendent of the San Francisco postofflce
and president of the Postal Device Com
pany, had Interested Mr. Erwin In the
time indicator and had induced him to
accompany Richardson to Washington,
D. C, for the purpose of introducing him
to postal officials and of getting them in
terested in the invention, which Mr. Er
win saw would be of vast benefit to the
service; that hl3 expenses while engaged
in such . wo'rk were paid by Richardson ;
that he received fifty shares of the old
Montague company stock from Rlchard
eon as a present; that he subsequently
exchanged these fifty shares for 100
shares of the stock of the Postal Device
and Improvement Company and received
from that company 500 additional shares
as a reward for certain Improvements
that he had made in the mechanism of
the machine; that Erwin did not know
that he was doing anything wrong in rec
ommending the adoptlon ; of the improve
ment by the department and never knew
that August W. Machen and George W.
Beavers held any stock in the company.
RICHARDSON TO THE FRONT.
United States District Attorney "Wood
worth placed Mr. Erwin on the stand for
further cross-examination.- Beginning
with.- his departure from San Franclsctf
with Richardson, Mr. Erwin testified as
follows:
Mr. Richardson and I left San Francisco on
the evening of November 3, 1S09, arrived at
Washington on the 11th and remained until the
21st. During that period we stopped at the
same hotel together, but were not together all
tho time. I attended to my business and he to
his. I did not devote, all told, more than three
tlays to Richardson and his device. I met
Machen and Beavers and presented this "device
to them. It spoke for Itself and we thought it
would be a good thing for the service. - Machen
expressed his approval of It in general terms,
and several weeks later a contract was entered
Into with the Postal Device and Improvement
Company. We had discussed the usefulness of
the device on two or three occasions. This is
the only device in which I ever had an interest
In bringing to the attention of the department,
und I do not know of any method for introduc
ing such a device to the Government, except I
that all contracts must originate with the First
Assistant Postmaster General, who, at that
time, was Perry S.: Heath. .Mr." Ma'chen had
the approval of it, but Mr. Beavers had nothing
to say or do about it, ; because the device Â¦ was
not for the use of his' department. I "have no
personal knowledge that Mr. â¢ Machen made a
report to Mr. Heath. The first order was for
70UO devices, was dated January 26, 1900, and
was signed by Mr. Allen, chief clerk to the
First Assistant Postmaster General, who had
the power no act in the absence of his supe
rior. - ' Â¦ . â¢

On May 3 sbe invited Joseph Gagan of
24 Franklin street to her rooms at 1
Fifth street and without any provocation
fired five shots at him. each- bullet taking
effect. About four years ago, while she
lived on Grant avenue, she invited George
Bowers, a grocery clerk, to her rooms and
fired three shots at him without effect
At that time she was adjudged insane and
sent to the insane asylum at Napa, hav
ing been released about a year ago.
The Judge said he did not believe that
the woman was in a responsible frame of
mind and hence she should be sent to th-s
Insane asylum instead of to San Quentin.
He suspended sentence and ordered her
sent to the insane ward in the Central
Emergency Hospital to be under observa
tion till to-morrow, when a Jury will be
again summoned to pass upon her sanity.
When the case was called for trial
about ten days ago the woman was sent
to the insane ward for observation' and
three days later Drs. McGettlgan and

opinion she was sane. The Jury so de

: The State of California authorizes Mr. George Mayerle, the
German Expert Optician at 107 1 Market street, to practice Opto-

sight. ;
MR. GEORGE MAYERLE has probably prescribed glasses
to more prominent men of the world than any other optician in
this country., The fact that the highest U. S. Army, Navy and
Government officials and most eminent clergymen, Judges and
educators of California are using his glasses should be sufficient
evidence of his wonderful ability to treat most complicated cases
with accuracy and absolute perfection.

TIVES of all dis
tricts in the Mission
and Potrero last Â¦ evening
adopted a resolution, after
discussion, approving . of
the action of The Call in
giving to the public the fact
that the proposed sewer
system for the city and
county of San Francisco,
upon which is based an is
sue of $7,250,000 of inter
est-bearing bonds, is radi
cally defective. Delegates
from half a score of clubs
were present and voted af
firmatively when the resolu
tion was submitted.
SCENE WHEN GEORGE I* CENTER
DENOUNCED DEFECTIVE . SEWER
SYSTEM PROPOSED FOR THIS CITT.
The life boats went alongside the
stricken vessel while the tugs lay some
distance off. The Gifford was lying
broadside on to th* heavy waves that
dashed with tercj^c force on the sides
of the vessel. Each successive wave
seemed to drive the unfortunate bark
closer to the shore and lessen her chance
of being saved by the tugs.
It was decided that an attempt should
be made at high tide to pull the Gifford
from her position on the rocks. The tugs
were assisted by the life saving crews in
making hawsers fast to the stranded ves
sel. The tide was at its highest at 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon and half an
hour before that time the tugs steamed
with every pound of steam in their boilers,
trying, to pull the Gifford from Mussel
Rock. The hawsers broke like strings
and again the life boats tossed and
tumbled in the heavy surf and carried
the lines from the tugs to the Gifford.
Another attempt was made to pull the
Glfford from the rocks exactly at high
tide, but it failed. The rocks held their
prey with tenacious hold and the work
of the tuffs was of no avail. A second
tine the hawsers parted and it was then
seen that the Gifford was doomed to de
struction. The tugs steamed for the har
bor and the life boats went to work to
bring ; Captain Michie and his comrades
from the doomed vessel to the shore, to
gether with their belongings.
Twice the life boats, in charge of Cap
tain Varney and Captain Grunbeck, . made
the perilous trip from the Gifford to the
shore. When the Gifford struck she was
about two hundred yards from the beach,
but the constant pounding of the waves
for twenty-four hours had placed her last
cerned the Gifford through bis marine
glass and gave the alarm. When the four
tugs and the three life boats arrived at
the scene of the wreck all the crew were
ashore with the exeception of Captain
Michie, First Officer Harry Laverick and
two of the sailors.
TTJGS FAIL AT RESCtTE.
When a landing was finally made Sec
ond Officer Ernest Clarke, with sailors
Lewis Berloner and carpenter E. Math
ews. climbed the steep bluff and ' made
across the range in the direction of
Colma. Their mission was to summon
assistance and also to get water for the
crew, as the barrels in the vessel's life
boats were filled with salt water and not
with the fresh liquid as demanded by law.
Captain Michie denied last evening that
the barrels were filled with salt water,
but the fact remained that the only water
the stranded sailors had to drink on the
beach was the scant supply carried by
some of the crew for miles across the hills
to thÂ« scene of the wreck. .
At 8 o'clock yesterday the lookout <jf
the South Side Life-saving Station dis-
At 7 o'clock yesterday morning Captain
Michie ordered that two of his life boats
be launched and a landing made on the
shore. The boats had a terrible struggle
with the waves and the sailors were
drenched to the skin by the waves dash
ing over the boats.
"WALKED MILES FOR AID.
vious to the disaster the mist cleared
away shortly after the vessel struck and
all through the night they could see a
white fixed light some miles up the beach.
If the fog cleared as Captain Michie and
his men claim It did. it seems incredible
that the lookout of the South Side Llfe
sa.ving Station did not notice the rockets
and flares from the wrecked vessel. As
in the case of the steamship Rio do Jan
eiro no help from the life saving men
reached the unfortunate mariners until
some hours after the disaster took place.
The bravery of the life saving crews ori
this coast is not to be questioned for an
Instant, but the lookout system seems to
be woefully at fault. If the Gifford had
been a passenger ship laden with many
human lives, another tale of awful loss
would have been added to the list of dis
asters on this coast.

FORD AT MUSSEL ROCK, AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF VESSEL'S CAP
TAIN AND SOME OF HER CREW.
The order was a t once given to man
the bark's likboats and prepare to launch
them. Good crder was maintained, and
after findlntr that the vessel was not
making much â¢*ater in the wells Captain
Michie decided t,, keep his men aboard
and signal for fo-ristance.
Through the dart watches of the night
the spray drench^ crew of the Gifford
clung heroically to their vessel. Rockets
trere sent up at frequent intervals for
two hours after the vessel struck. .
Flares were burned f rom 9 p. m. until
midnight, but no ans* cr came from the
ROCKETS FIRED FOR HELP.
VO/ie the sailors were aloft taking in
sail tie first officer threw the sounding
lead ar.d discovered that he was in shal
low wtcr. His warning cry to Captain
Michie f, m e too late. The Glfford piled
on Musi-i Rock end her forward and
rfiddle compartments were pierced by the
eharp pir.t^cles.
All hands were on deck at the time of
the disaster. First Officer Harry Lav
crick was on watch when the bark went
lEhore. At 6 o'clock in the evening the
Â«atchf>s were changed, and owing to the
dtise fog Captain Michie decided to take
in =ui sail and put his vessel about, fear
ing that he might be too close to the
coat' for safetv. â¢
At the time the Glfford went ashore
the fog was so dense that It waa impos
sible for those on board to see a chip's
length ahead. Men on the masthead and
forward on the bark could not detect the
noise of the breakers owing to the thun
der of the sea, and. though the captain
of the vessel, David Michie. knew that
he was in the. vicinity of the Golden Gate,
he did not know that he was south of
the haven of safety and in the twinkling
< f an eye the valuable bark and her cargo
Â¦were lost to the use of man. The Gif
ford ran with a crash upon the sharp
rocks that lie twelve miles south of the
Cliff House.*
STRUCK HT DENSE FOG.
Gifford, seventy-five days out
from Newcastle, New South Wales, with
a cargo of coal for this port, went ashore
on Mussel Rock on Friday evening at 6
O'clock and is now lying at the mercy
of thÂ« wind and -waves, a wreck. ' The
entire crew of the bark saved their lives
after a battle with the waves.
The first news that the Gifford was
cshore vas made known yesterday morn-
Ing' at 8 o'clock, when she was sighted
by the lookout of the South Side Ufe
eaving Etation five miles north of the
wreck. The alarm was at once given and
in a short space of time the lifeboats
from, the South Side, Golden Gate and
Fort Point stations were launched and
proceeded to the scene of the disaster.
Telephone messages were sent to the
Merchants' Exchange and to the offices
of the tugboat companies and two hours
after the news of the wreck was made
known the tugs Sea Rover, Relief. Sea
King and Defiance were pitching and toss
ing close to the ill-fated bark.
DECEIVED by the dense fog that
has lain low over the ocean along
the coast for the last two days,
the British four-masted bark
The British ship General Gordon, from
Newcastle, N. S. W., also had a narrow
escape from going on the rocka the same
time the Glfford did. The two vessels
were in sight of each other since Tues
day last, and at the time the Glfford
struck the General Gordon was about a
quarter of a mile away from her. The
General Gordon secured Pilot Hayes
shortly before dusk, and when the pilot
climbed aboard the vessel was close in
ehore in the .vicinity of Mussel Rock. Pilot
Hayes was obliged to steer a northwest
course from Mussel Rock in order to get
his bearings on the lightship, thence into
the Golden Gate. Neither Pilot Hayes
nor the crew \ of the General Gordon
sighted the land on Friday night, though
they could hear, the noise of the surf
breaking on the shore. _^
WRECKED VESSEL'S HISTORY.
â¢The wrecked bark Glfford was "built at
Greenock, Scotland, eleven years ago.
She was of 2113 net tonnage and con
structed of steel, and was rated 100 Al
at Lloyd's. She left pardiff, Wales, a
year ago with a cargo of coal for Monte
video, South America. Thence she pro
ceeded to Rio Blanco, South America, . in
ballast, and from that point carried a
cargo of wheat to Sydney, Australia. She
was then ordered to Newcastle, N. S. W.,
and left that port on July 12 last for San
Francisco with. 3500 tons of coalconslgned
to J. J. Moore & Co. of this city."
.. The Gifford was 281 feet 6 Inches 1n
length. 42 feet beam and 24 feet 6 inches
deep. She was owned by Andrew Weir
of Glasgow, Scotland, and was valued at
about $90,000. The valug of her cargo of
coal is estimated at about $18,000.
Â¦ The crew of. the Gifford numbered twen
ey-seven men all told. '. In addition to her
captain and three jmates she carried six
teen hands forward, . four petty officers
and three apprentices.
First Officer Harry Laveflck, who was
in charge of the watch when the Glf
ford struck, made the following state
ment when he came ashore last evening:
"The fog was so dense yesterday that
we could not see 100 feet ahead. We were
steering northeast by east Just before we
struck. We heard a fog whistle at 3
o'clock in the afternoon, and we were not
sure what whistle it was. We could not
see any lights on shore when it got dark.
From our dead reckoning and the bear
ings we secured on Thursday by the sun
we thought we were heading directly for
the Golden Gate.' I was taking a sound-
Ing Just as the vessel struck."
FIRST MATE'S STATEMENT.
Captain Michie proceeded to the South
Side* Life-saving station and at that point
the crew of the 6tation put him aboard
an Italian fishing boat bound for the
harbor. At a late hour last night word
was received from the South Side Life
saving station that the entire crew of the
Gifford was still on the beach near the
wreck and that they would remain there
all night and would be brought into the
city to-day. Captain Michie could not
be located last night, though It was
known that he was landed at Meiggs
wharf by the Italian fishermen on whose
boat he came into the harbor.
evening one hundred yards nearer shore.
When Captain . Mlchie of the Glfford
came * ashore last evening j from, his
wrecked vessel he made the following
statement:
"We left Newcastle, New South Wales,
seventy-five days ago, on Friday. We
did not sight land, with the exception of
a small island, until we got off the coast
of California. On Thursday morning
last we could discern the coast through
the haze. I took my bearings by thesun
on Thursday noon and shortly after that
the foe settled down on us and it was
thick until after we went ashore. I as
sumed that we were some distance from
the Golden Gate, but we could not see
any lights and did not hear any of the
fog whistles. '. After we struck we sent
up rockets and burned flares, but we re
ceived no answer from the shore. The
fog clearei after we struck and we could
see a fixed white light some distance
north of us. I deny that the barrels on
our lifeboats were filled with salt water.
It may be that salt water got Into the
barrels when the boats came ashore. I
do not care to make any further state
ment until I have seen our local agents,
J. J. Moore & Co."
RESOLVED, That we
tender the thanks of
the Federation of
Mission Improvement Clubs
to The Call for the able
manner in which it has
shown up the glaring de-
of the proposed new
sewer system ; and we hope
that every citizen interested
in seeing that this city does
not undertake the construc
tion of a sewer system
which would make the con
ditions worse than they are
at present, will read the ar
ticle on the proposed sewer
system contained in The
Call of September 25, 1903.

Continued on Paare 37. Column 1* ,
clubs should oppose the Issuance of sew
er bonds for a sewer system, at this time
for the following reasons:
"That the scheme proposed by the en
gineers is not a practicable solution of
the sewage problem.
"That an attempt to construct the. pro
posed sewer system would cause the ques
tion of sewer construction to be tied up
in the courts for year3 and indefinitely
delay the construction of much-needed
sewers.
"That if the engineers are correct in
characterizing sewage as 'highly danger
ous,' then the construction of such a
sewer system would not only be a publlo
nuisance, but a menace to the publlo
health.
"If the sewers were constructed as pro
posed the Â¦ flood of gravel-laden water
from the steep slopes of the Mission, hills
would flood the district from Fourteenth
to 'Eighteenth, street as it has never
been flooded before, causing large dam
age, for which the city would be liable.
The sand would fill the sewer, as it has
Mission Creek, and is now filling Channel
street.
SEES TROUBLE attra-t*.
"The Missionites might take & malicious
pleasure in the fact that the sewer would
fill with gravel, because it would transfer
the windlass and bucket from Division
street to Sansome, Market and Second
streets and give the downtown merchant*
an experience with the delectable pile at
each manhole from, which thÂ© Mission dis
trict has suffered so long by reason of
the criminal neglect of the city govern
ment, aided by the indifference of the
citizens who do not reside In the afflicted
district. .â¢>â¢-
j. he proposition of a sewer system, wttH
four pumping stations for a city buflt oa
hills and surrounded by tide water Is
ridiculous, if not ludicrous."
Mr. Center moved the adoption of ths
resolution concerning The Call and the
sewer system.
George H. Roundey of the University
Mound and Bay View Improvement Club
seconded the motion to adopt the resolu
tion and spoke pertinently concerning it.
He called attention to the lamentable
plight in which thÂ© lower part of the- city
would be when thÂ« tide flowed Into the
North Point main sewer and backed up
the sewage at every ordinary high tide.
E. M. Ritter asked a few Questions.
The resolution was then adopted.
After referring some resolutions for fur
ther consideration and hearing the plea
of Mr. Felt, delegate from the LJck and
Wllmerdlng District Improvement Club.
for assistance in having the district
sewered and provided with a much-needed
schoolhouse, the meeting adjourned.
GRTJNSKY MAKES REPLY.
Tries to Justify Flan of Proposed
Sewer System.
City Engineer Grunsky filed yesterday
Â¦with the Board of Supervisors what pur
ported to be a â¢ refutation of the claims
made in The Call relative to the pro
posed snwer system for this city. The
principal claims made in this paper in
connection with the system were that the
North Point main sewer, the main kÂ»y

"We ! are asked to swallow- this sewer
proposition," he .". continued, "Just as we
swallowed the proposition of a new City
Hall/ Then we got a picture of a build
ing â¢ and an estimate of $1,500,000 as the
cost of its construction. Now 'we get a
tank of sewage under the city, extending
The resolution concerning the sewer
system was introduced by George I* Cen
ter. . He made the statement that he had
taken the article in The Call, relative to
the proposed system and had carefully
verified it by going to the official reports
of the city authorities in reference to the
scheme for the sewer, construction, If the

new system is proposed by several. engi
neers," said Mr. Center. "The proposition

its merits." â¢ Mr. Center spoke calmly, but
was evidently very much in earnest.
INTRODUCES RESOLUTION. â¢
sewer system for the city and
county of San Francisco, which is made
the official basis for the sewer bond issue
of $7,250,000, to be voted upon this week.
"We tender the thanks of the Federa
tion of Mission Improvement. Clubs to
The Call," so ran the text of the resolu
tion, "for the able manner in which The
Call has shown up the glaring defects of
the proposed new sewer system." Allu
sion was made to "the construction of a
sewer system which would make the con
ditions worso than they are at present."
There was but one dissenting voice when
the resolution was submitted to the dele
gates from all the Mission Improvement
Clubs for a vote. .
The Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs is made up of delegates represent
ing every section of the great Mission dis
trict and the Potrero. The improvement
dubs affiliated in the federation are the
University | Mound and Bay View, the
Holly Park and Mission Street, the Falr
mount and Olen Park, the Sunnyslde Pro
gressive, the West of Castro Street, the
Ocean, View Property Owners', the Mar
ket-street and Eureka Valley, the Nuevo
Potrero, 'the Lake "View and Ingleside,
the Mission Road, the Eureka Valley and
Park Lane, the South San Francisco and
the Preclta Valley clubs. Each of these
clubs is entitled to three delegates in the
federation. Last evening every section
was well represented. The practically
unanimous decision to Indorse the course
of The Call therefore meant that the
great Mission district and its environs,
through its chosen representatives of
every section, . condemned, emphatically
the scheme of the engineers to take the
sewage of a great part of the city down
from the high city levels to zero and
bring upon the city a great expense for a
system that is denounced as impractical
and inadequate.' ,;Â£Â¦
THE Federation of Mission Im
provement Clubs last evening
voted thanks to The Call for
calling attention to the radi
cal defects in the proposed
Mr. Center then passed to another con
sideration. He took the view that an at
tempt to construct such a system as is
proposed would result in proceedings In
court. "I do not know what action the
residents , and property owners in the
downtown districts will take in regard to
this sewer proposition," he said. "The
property owners of the Mission district
will . contest !n the . courts the proposition
to : construct a sewer on the lines pro
posed by the engineers, and we do not
believe the courts will condemn a district
to be flooded by. the stopping of Its nat
ural drainage channels, or to decree that
the property from Eighteenth to. Eleventh
street shall have a sewage bath every
twenty-four hours at the dictation of a
few impracticable men posing as civil en
gineers. ' All members of the Improvement
"To prevent this sewage tank from leak
ing in the depression between Eighteenth
and Eleventh streets our engineers have
provided a series of dams across the nat
ural drainage channels of the district, one
at. Eighteenth street, one at Fif
teenth street, one at Fourteenth
street and one at Eleventh street. These
dams will rise to a height of more than
four feet above the city base. At Four
teenth street the top of the dam will be
about two feet below the surface of the
streets and about six feet nine inches
above the bottom of the present sewer.
At extreme high tide we will have a bank
of sewage six feet nine inches deep from
Eighteenth street to the outlet. Â°
"In the depressed district from Eight
eenth street to Eleventh street, and espe
cially at Fourteenth street, the
will rise in the sewers twice a day, forc
ing the gas through the side sewers and
house connections and making it impossi
ble to repair or make a connection in the
side sewers except at extreme low tide.
"This ' is the district that suffers from
floods caused by heavy showers that visit
us every winter from five to ten times.
One can imagine but cannot realize what
this district would resemble should one
of these showers occur at â¢ the time of
high tide after such a sewer system had
been inaugurated. Fearful lest . this dis
trict, naturally tributary to this sewage
tank, should not furnish enough to fill it,
our engineers have thoughtfully and at
great expense diverted the sewage of
Ocean View and 'Â¦ part of the territory
tributary, .to the Army street sewer, and
also sewage from the southern slopes of

WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Sept. 26.â James
Boswell was probably fatally injured in a
game of football here to-day. His neck
was dislocated In a. scrimmage.
Football Player Is Fatally Injured.
The decision means â¢ that racing con
cerns cannot rule orderly persons off the
track. In each case .where â¢ the com
plainant can prove that he was not ad
mitted to a place of amusement on a
purchased ticket, the defendant must for
feit $100. The grounds on which a refusal
to admit may be based- are drunkenness
and immoral character. 'Â»:
The Supreme Court declared yesterday
that the officials of the Western Turf As
sociation acted illegally in refusing to
admit Hyman Greeneberg to the races at
the Tanforan track in December; 1S99.
The plaintiff published a 5 daily racing
form and sought damages on the ground
that his business was injured. The court
holds that any place of amusement is
open to any person conducting himself
properly. It .is declared,- however, that
Greeneberg can get nothing for the in-
Jury done his business, as he was not sup-,
posed from a legal standpoint to conduct
a private business at a place of public
amusement. . . â¢

Only one record, that for the two-mile

Our Motto was beaten in a peculiar
manner. She led Donneybrook ' to the
hare, which she caught on the fly. Her
hold was Insecure and the hare escaped.
The pair of dogs then ran for one min
ute and thirty seconds, Donneybrook fin
ally winning by a score of 15 to 9. â¢

M. C. Delano of Rocklin, F. P. Clark of

each have two or more representatives
still in the running.
The likely winners to-day look to be:
BlcVey hardly ran up to the expecta
tions of his admirers. The son of Fetter
Free found it difficult to beat Ploughman
in a course lasting one minute and thir
teen seconds. . The score was 13 to 10.
He meets Fair Tralee in the first course
this morning and a great trial is ex
pected. . . r"'. Â¦
Mi Amigo, one of the most promising
candidates in the stake, was beaten by
Richard Anton in the shortest course of
the day. The trial lasted fifteen seconds
and the score was 3 to 0. Mi Amigo was
never able to get into his stride and did
not do htonself Justice. He was a 1 to 5
choice in the betting.
T. J. Cronln's* Fair Tralee, which was
conceded to beHhe class of the 'stake un
til he was injured recently, appeared and
ran like a champion. If the running to
day does not aggravate -the wound on his
foot he is believed to have a royal chance
for the stake. He ran but twenty-three
seconds in his trial yesterday with Chu
chu. . â¢ ' . Â¦ ,

UNCLE TRIUMPHS
IN THIRTEENTH
Game Closes With Fight
Between Townsend
and Umpire.
Two Errors in Sixth Round
Cost the Senators a
Victory.
Four extra rounds had to be clipped off
yesterday at Recreation Park ere Uncle
Hank could call the game his. It might
have belonged to Fisher but for the er
rors which his cohorts committed. At all
events it was a great game of ball- and It
broke up with a fight between McDonald
and Townsend. Score,' 3 to 2.
Excitement was there all the time, but
It remained for the last period to Curnish
the genuine stuff. Irwln was on second
when Krug pounded the ball to center
field. The ball came right to the plate,
but curved away from Graham at the last
minute, giving Irwln a chance to slide
in safely.
The ire of the entire Senatorial band
was aroused at McDonald's verdict and
they began to swarm around the official.
As soon as Graham had finished making
his little talk, Cy Townsend butted in and
made a pass at the umpire. This was the
signal for a general uproar and for a
moment it looked like an old time fight.
McDonald showed bis real lighting spirit
by making a rush at Townsend and he
would have probably finished the big first
baseman with a few good wallops had
not Tommy Leahy and Mike Fisher step
ped between him and" his Intended victim
ajid prevented a scrap which seemed due.
All the way through the game was a
dandy. The Senators would have won,
3 to 0, if Fitigerald )and Townsend had
not made errors in the sixth which feave
the home team Its start of two runs. Ir
win led off with a hit and Krug dropped
a Elow ona to Fitzgerald. He lost his
bearings for a minute and threw the ball
away to second. This allowed Irwln to go
to third and Krug to take second.
Then Pabst bit an easy one to Egan.
The ball was fielded nicely to Townsend,
but the latter dropped it and then picked
it up in a hurry. Pabst arrived at the
bag- just then and the umpire called him
safe. The two runs came in during the
mlxup and the score was tie for seven
innings.
Fitzgerald and his opponent, Jimmy
Whalen, pitched great ball all the time.
The Sacramento twirler had a shade the
better of the argument, but he spoiled
his chances by making the disastrous er
ror at the critical, moment. The fielding
on both sides was rapid and clean. The

The youthful athletes of the Bay Coun
ties Athletic League tampered with a few
more records yesterday at the eighth
semi-annual field day on the Berkeley
campus. Before it was all over two of
the cherished things had been tumbled
off -last year's shelf and smashed.
The heroes of the day were Sr>erry df
the Berkeley High School and De Mamiel
of the Lowell High School. Sperry was
easily king however, for he not only cut
four-fifths 6f a second off the Bay Coun
ties' 220-yard hurdle record, lowering it
to :27 1-5, but he won three .firsts for his
school. . De Mamiel centered all his ef
forts on the mile run and succeeded in
breaking his record of 4:48, reducing the
same to 4:47 3-5.
In the other events the work of the
athletes was ordinary and much of the
time made was far below the Bay Coun
ties* records. Schwartz of the Lowell
High School won the 50-yard and 100-yard
dashes without any trouble, but did noth
ing phenomenal in the way of fast run
ning.
Lowell High School won the field day
with 41 points, their opponents trailing
along lir. the Â¦following' order: Oakland

The naval academy was weak In team
work and the players were inexperienced.
The ends and baclcs were fspccuilly slow
and the punting poor. Stanford has im
proved wonderfully In all rcspect3 since
tho game with Reliance last week. The
line was strong to-day and the backs
played in first-rate form. If the improve
ment continues Stanford may yet have an
even chance of winning from California,

but Reliance held' on its twenty-flve-yard
line. Finding bucking fruitless. Reliance
kicked to the fifty-yard line, where Bel
knap of the Berkeley team fumbled the
ball and Gochen, the speedy Reliance end,
captured it.
Again Berkeley was penalized for two
offside plays and after Ineffectual at
tempts at bucking the line was forced to
paps the ball back to Overall for a punt.
Overall placed the ball on Rellanco'c
twenty-yard line and It was carried ten
yards farther, when Reliance held and
punted the ball out of danger. Berkeley
forced the ball down again to the Re
liance thirty-five-yard line. Overall tried
for a field goal, but the ball was passed
too hieh for him and he fumbled. Gris
sler punted the ball out to Berkeley's
twenty-yard line and the whistle sounded
for the end of the half.
The second half was largely a repetition
of the first. Upon some fake kicks Berke
ley gained at times and she also made
ground by shifting the backs Into mass
formation behind the line. But Reliance
proved too 6trong to allow the collegians
to score and the game ended with the
ball In a fair catch by Gelssler on Berke
ley's thirty-five-yard line.
The line-up of the teams was as fol

yards. Geissler, the old Stanford man.
distinguished himself by his able returns
of pverall's punts.
California took the kick-off In the first
half. Stow kicking the ball down to Re
liance's ten-yard line. Reliance tried
straight bucks without success and gave
the pigskin to Geissler to kick. After
vainly trying Reliance's line, Berkeley
kicked to Reliance's f|rty-yard line.
Berkeley's gamÂ© was ragged. Their
chief fault seemed to lie In the lack of
team work sufficient to force the ball
through their opponents' line. Tackles
would Interfere with the backs In runs
around the end and If a hole was opened

fierce bucks of the Reliance would break

The wearers of the "C" felt certain

NATIONAL GUARD VETERANS.
The veterans of the National Guard of
California gave an entertainment and
dance in the armory of Troop A. cavalry,
at 28 Golden Gate avenue last Friday
night, which was well attended and
proved a very delightful -semi-military
function. In the audience there were
quite a number of gentlemen in uniform
and the gold braid added splendor to the
effect during the dance that followed the
rendition of the programme. During the
dance there was a pretty play of electric
and lime lights. The following was the
programme that entertained the guests
of the veterans:
Ensign E. J. Louis of the naval militia
has been assigned to the special examin
ing board, vice R. N. Miller, resigned.
A feeling of apathy has been apparent
in the upper line for some time and that
feeling has descended and affected every
guardsman and the condition is such at
this time that it will require a mighty
effort to put the National Guard on its
feet again and to save it from adverse
comment by inspectors from the United
States army. Much of this feeling is no
doubt due to the uncertainty as to who
will be at the head of the organization
during the term of the present command
er-in-chief. Those who are in and ex
pect that the official will cut short their
military existence have but little inter
est in the organizations and the rank
and file below the superior officers are
apathetic because they are in doubt as
to who will rule, and they do not take
much interest In the work, as there Is no
one to encourage them. There is no doubt
that if occasion presented itself the
several organizations would again bt.
ready to go to the front, as they did in
1S9S, but at this time it will require some
thing of that kind to arouse mo v than
75 per cent o: thÂ«- National Guarc of this
State.
Colonel Wilhelm. U. S. A., who has dur
ing his stay on this coast given much at
tention to the National Guard and has
offered many valuable suggestions for its
betterment, has been ordered by the War
Department at Washington, D. C, to act
as inspector of the Guard of California.
FEELING OF APATHY.
The dispatches from Washington. D. C.
to the effect that the reports of the army
officers charged with the inspection of
the National Guard of the various States
have all been IllÂ«?d -with the proper of
ficers at the War Department, but that
some of them are so uncomplimentary
that it has been decided not to make such
reports public except to send to each Gov
ernor the report for his State and allow
him to make it public if he desires, has
excited the. curiosity of the National
Guardsmen of this city and possibly the
entire State of California. The question
here is, '"Does this mean us?" From the
amount of indifference that has been
manifested in National Guard affairs in
this State since the return of the boys
from the Philippines, except in an organ
ization here ena there, it is but small
wonder that the army officers have found
reason to be uncomplimentary to the
State soldiery. There has been great dif
ficulty In this State in keeping up even
the tn:r.imum of organization; there has
not Leen that spirit that is requisite to
n.akc &-ocd soldiers, and outside of a few
organizations the guard in California, as
one of the line officers recently said, "has
been dead for some time, but has not yet
discovered it." x$
Guardsmen Wonder as
to Result of National
Inspection.

On Wednesday evening, September 23
Miss Bessie Pennington. the charming
and accomplished daughter of Mr and
Mrs. George W. Pennington, was married
at the family home. 1015 Shotwell street
to Irving H. Sanborn, the popular young
lawyer, the Rev. Dr. Larkln of Grace
Methodist Episcopal Church officiating.
The wedding was one of the prettiest of
the season, the rooms being decorated
with an abundance of flowers, white and
pink predominating. The bride was beau
tiful in pearl embroidered silk etamlne
over white silk. The lace veil caught with
natural orange blossoms was presented bV
her grandmother. Her bouquet was of
white roses. The only ornament worn was
a necklace of gold beads, the gift of the
groom. The attendants were Miss Edith
Pennington. sister of the bride and
Charles Taylor. Miss Pennington was
charming in white organdy, richly
trimmed with lace and pink satin ribbon
Her flowers were pink roses. The favors
presented by the bride and groom to
their attendants were a pearl sunburst
Bet with a ruby and a gold watch chain
The many handsome and costly presents
received by the happly couple attested
the love and esteem in which they are
held. Immediately after the wedding sup
per Mr. and Mrs. Sanborn left for an ex
tended trip south.
Mr. and Mrs. K. Borren will celebrate
Mr. and Mrs. William Thomas Fonda of
SOU Sacramento street will celebrate the
fiftieth anniversary of their marrlase to
day. The original notice of their wedding
is as follows:
"In Marysville. September 27. 1S53, at the
residence of the bride*Â« brother-in-law
Colonel Stuart . Perry. William Thomas
Fonda to Eleanore Margaret MIddleton
daughter of Mrs. Eleanore Middleton of
New York, N. Y. Miss Julia Rowe was
bridesmaid and Colonel Jeff Ilalsey best
man. After a brief stay in" San Francisco
the happy couple will make their home in
the new house Mr. Fonda has just built
and furnished."
Mr. and Mrs. Fonda have resided for
nearly thirty-flve years at 3011 Sacramen
to street, where a family of six children
have grown up. They are: Charles P.,
Harry Stuart, Walter G., William M. (de
ceased), Mrs. Helen Walker and Mr3.
Lewis V. Hentrich. There are four grand
children; Misses Marjorie R., Julia, Elfle
and Eleanor Fonda.
There are some very happy functions in
the air that will be given in the sweet
rame of charity. There seems "to be
some psychological reason why charity
affairs always come off at election time.
Could it be that the good ladies addicted
to the bazaar habit have any ulterior
reason for making their dates thus?
Many of the social clubs are
awakening after their long summer sleep,
and no doubt the next -month Will show
many pleasant affairs on the cards.

Music at the Park.
In designing the eystem one of the most Im
portant conations to meet was the collection
and dlBcharg* of the rain water and sewage
U' gravity that is without pumping. The
engineer* gav* considerable study to obtain
this object, ati have eucceeded in reducing
to a reasonable minimum the areas from
which it Is nectary to artificially raise the
tÂ» wage bo that It can be discharged at proper
outlet*. To accomplish it they have studied
the best available gradient and the least ex
renrive alignment ,.t the intercepters which
prevent the Bewa^. c f the higher territory
from naturally reaching low territory, where
it would thereafter require pumping:. To gain
this object even tunnel, have been suggested,
as they were found to *ffeet economical solu
tion* in a few instance*. The alignment also
of the main collecting ** W fcrs ha* been care-
Tully studied with a view \ 0 economy and efn-
L Tbcs* r"Â»'n newert have tec placed so that
through which practically all the city
nsust drain, was eo depressed that twice
every day and during the entire period
of the lnflowinc of high tide the sewage
will be backed up by the tidal waters;
that the ordinary high tides will regular
ly flow to the junction of Howard and
Sixth streets and extra high tides to Har
rison and Tenth streets: that the entire
idea of taking the sewage from the nat
ural h!sh levels of the city down to zero
and attempting to handle it there is radi
cally wTong, and that witn the low grade
of the North Point main sewer rt is very
doubtful, considering the great masses of
ejjid that will run Into It. and consider
ing also the fact that the tide will twice
every day back up the contents of the
sewer, whether the sewage will be dls
tharged.
il r . Grunsky quotes Mr. Rudolph Her
rue in justification of the low grade of
the North Point main sewer, but the text
cf v.-hat Mr. Herring has to Eay, which
is. C'ven herewith. Is found not to apply
nt ai' to the plan for discharging the
sewzgÂ» at North Point, but mainly to
the co'.U-ctlon of sewage Into the main
sewer. The auo tations from the state 
monts rn-cde by Mr. Herring that are sup
plied by llr. Grunsky are as follows:

WASHINGTON. Sept. 26.â First Assistant
Postmaster General Wynne has Issued an or
der putting Into effect the terms of the new
postal treaty between the United States and
Cuba on October 9 next. The treaty pro
vides for the transfer of malls from one coun
try to the other at domestic rates.
a pension of $15 a month. Dr. Rafferty
of the United States army visited the hos
pital yesterday to make inquiries about
Holmes' case. The body was removed to
the Morgue.
The proposition Is to expend more than
$7,000,000 on a sewer system, the working
of which, as witness the preceding words
by Mr. Grunsky, Is described only as
"most likely."
Mr. Grunsky in his communication falls
back upon the relief outlets or emergency
reliefs to supply relief when the waters
of the tides are strenuous as against the
proper action of the main sewer, but
his tone is conspicuously uncertain. Mr.
Grunsky's plea on tnis point is In full as
follows:
In tha printed report of 1S89 a statement Is
made which shows that variation of flow due
to change the ele\*atlon of the water surface
of the bay was not overlooked. "Finally, it
remains to be said that the emergency reliefs
will be most likely to be in service during high
tides, being the time when the outflow from
the main sewers is a minimum."
The constructive features of the new sew
ers have been designed on the pest principles
now known to the profession. The sewers have.
In the first place, been given a sufficient
gradient wherever practicable, to prevent \ia
due deposits and have been given the best sec
tional ehape to secure the most effective flow.
They have been given such dimensions as ex
perience has warranted, and it has been as
eume-d In the estimate of cost that they are
built of durable materials, with skillful labor
and under proper supervision.
they carry the sewage as rapidly as possible
to the outfalls without facilitating a deposit of
eol!<3 matter any more than is unavoidable In
Euch cases.
OPPOSE PROPOSED SEWER SYSTEM
The chief interest naturally centered
upon the Viola of Miss Constance Craw
ley, who has been winning: golden opin
ions by her Everyman. Possibly
to accentuate the difference between
the two characters, Miss Crawley's
Viola leaned a little more to
ward the comedy possibilities of the role
rather than to its sentimental side, though
there was no lack of emotional variety.
And very charmingly she looked the part,
and as the mald-turned-servlng-man to
Orsino, as embassy of her master's love
to Olivia, as the sister of Sebastian, as
the terrified adversary of Sir Andrew
Aguecheek, as true love to Orsino, she
ehowed herself In all phases of the char
acter ripely sufficient. She was tender,
sad, gay by times and all happily. Pe
culiarly clear and agreeable Is her dic
tion, her every word clearly to be heard
all over the vast auditorium. Miss
ley's Viola all around ranks with the best
conceptions of the character seen here.
As Malvollo Mr. Greet gave a striking
and richly humorous performance. Every
point was made to tell, and the intended
conflict of sympathy and ridicule in the
audience for the character was excited to
utmost extent. The scene of the "yellow
stockings with cross-garters" was a comic
gem, and one sees Mr. Greet in this only
to regret that we have not had his Touch
stone and other such parts, in which the
actor has so much to bestow. Curiously,
there was some slight uncertainty in the
lines, the actor showing, however, a nota-'
bit gift of improvisation In supplying the
deficiency. To-morrow night, however,
when we shall have the comedy locally in
Lyric Hall, the great stage manager will
doubtless not have to give us Greet, how
ever good, for Mr. Shakespeare.
John Sayer Crawley was the Orsino,
and showed a distinguished Intelligence
and virile poetry in his conception. So
commonly slighted, the character was
here given with the weight and dignity
necessary to give the full value to love
of Viola. The picture gained tremendous
ly thereby, and Mr. Crawley's few scenes
were wholly grateful.
A bit of thoroughly satisfying acting
was the Sir Toby Belch of Robert Smiley.
Voice, gait, makeup, everything com
bined to make the portrait of the jovial
toss-pot a sheer Joy. Mr. Smiley was ex
cellently foiled by the beautiful fatuity
of Robert Halford Forster's Sir Andrew,
that was every foolish thing that the
playwright has so slyly painted it. The
clown was Dallas Anderson's care, and
excellently handled. Mr. Anderson has an
unusually pleasing voice, and sang two
songs by Oscar Well in a fashion that
gave much pleasure. There would have
oeen more, but the Lyric Quintet, that
accompanied, was accompanying any
tlling but Mr. Anderson.
Of these songs of Mr. Weil's, by the
way, "Come Away, Death" is one of the
most charming and characteristic lyrics
that I have heard for some time. Mr.
Weil has caught exactly the Shakes
pearean color, and the haunting yet gentle
melancholy of the phrase lingers with one
long after Its singing. But the songs are
both rarely beautiful.
And now Olivia. The Good Deedes of
"Everyman," whose sweet voice and face
so charmed there, is equally charming as
Miss Alys Rees In Olivia. She has a wom
anly and spirited grasp of the role and
fails in none of, its requirements. Miss
Rees 1 diction Is notably clear.
Margaret Bucklin is the Maria, and hu
morous and spontaneous in the part. Her
delivery is overhurrled. however, at times,
and she has something yet to learn of
clear speaking. The rest are all sufficient,
and I the local performance of the play
should by no means be missed.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
As uniquely interesting: as the perform
ance Itself yesterday, in the production
of "Twelfth Night" at the University of
California, was the opportunity of seeing
a Shakespearean play against the back
ground of a Greek theater. Something
like a ballet in St. Mary's one would
Imagine the effect of the ordinary com
edy on Berkeley's classic stage to be.
Pitiful enough it is with all its make-up,
but what of it without its dusty hand
box of tricks, without the merciful rouge
and calcium? Picture any -one. of a late
half dozen comedies with which you are
familiar playing under the light of day,
with, for incidental music, rustling trees
and singing birds; for settings, a table,
three chairs and some potted plants: for
background, the cool and stately columned
wall of the Greek stage, as the "Twelfth
Night" was given yesterday. Picture
there, for example, "The Taming of
Helen"â but that is enough.
How glltterlngly well the. old comedy
stood the test of these conditions will
be known only to the fortunate four or
five thousand who saw It yesterday. The
illusion was complete. Even the dog that
wandered in past the tollkeepers into the
middle of a scene between Malvollo and
Viola seemed under its spell. He took
the center of the stage soberly until. the
scene was over and got a hand all to him
self as he trotted off solemnly again at
Ben Greet's amused Invitation. But the
comedy was at one with the big verities
that surrounded it. There wasn't a line
of it rang falsely. Its humor bubbled up
as spontaneously as the bird songs that
accompanied it, its poetry fell as tenderly
as the llKht of the Turner sunset that
blessed its close. Viola seemed never
more womanly gracious, Malvollo more
quaintly conceited, nor that immortal trio
âSir Toby, Sir Andrew Aguecheek and
Festeâ more tickingly humorous. It was
one more triumph for Shakespeare the
Immortal, one more proof that the play's
the thing.
It ia true that Mr. Ben Greet and his
company of English players who gave the
play were particularly happy in its inter
pretation. There was also the Interest
of Mr. Greet's own first appearance upon
the local stage, and another matter of
fascinating moment was the emerging of
the rest of the company from the Eliza
bethan incognito of "Everyman."
Shakespearean Play Is
Well Acted by Greet' s
Company.

Â¦ duction of an original oil paintinj? bv Franz Mortclmans. the distinguished
j flower painter of Belgium. It won a gold medal for him at the Brussels Expo-
Â¦ sition in 1890.
j i ' Franz Mortelmana was born in Antwerp in 1865 and is considered by many

I tastes, whose greatest joy was the progress and education- of his children in the
j arts he loved so well â painting and music. It was his habit to take them fre-
j quently on excursions to the woods in search of flowers. Nothing pleased the
t little Franz more than to draw crude forms in the dry earth and sand. Display-
[; ing unusual aptitude in outlining flowers and still life, at the early age of 11
h he went to the academy to become a decorator and scene painter. At the age

liant plays, the Harvard backs doing excellent
work individually. Both teams relied on the
old style playing, using only simple line bucks
and short end runs. Williams made little gain
through the Harvard line and waa forced to
punt on almost every trial. On the other
hand the crimson team gained at will through
all parts of their opponent's line. Lineup:

Captain Handy of the West Forty-cev
enth-street police station hopes to make
an arrest soon. He and Coroner Scholer
are widely at variance in their theories.
In the opinion of the Coroner the assault
which resulted in Verdu's death was
probably committed by thugs hired by
the woman under surveillance to drive
away the detectives. Captain Handy and
Detective Sergeant Arthur. Casey do not
agree with this view of the case ajid hold
that the assault resulted because of a
mistaken opinion as to the purpose of the
"shadowers" by persons in the vicinity.
According to those who witnessed the
assault six young men rushed upon Verdu
and Hansen, and, heaping vile epithets
upon them, proceeded to beat them with
fists and clubs. Verdu was struck sense
less at first and died later at a hospital.
Hansen is held at the station until some
evidence can be gathered.
NEW YORK, Sept. 26.â Having been as
signed to a case that Involved the repu
tation of a woman, the wife of a man
in business below Wall street, Frederick
A. Verdu and James Hansen took their
station in West Fifty-eighth street on
Thursday afternoon. They had been in
structed to "shadow" the woman, whose
husband suspected her of infidelity, and
serve papers upon her if she attempted
to leave the city.
The two men remained In Fifty-fifth
street near Eighth avenue, several houra
on Thursday afternoon. Their presence
was noticed by the children of the neigh
borhood, one of whom asked Verdu for a
penny. Thinking to avoid attention, Ver
du told the little one he would give a
penny to the one who would be the first
to do a eum in arithmetic. The children
gathered about him and he had them add
a few figures.
When Verdu and Hansen returned on
Friday afternoon to their post they were
immediately recognized by the children.
Again sums were paid for with pennies,
but Verdu did not find it easy to rid him
self of the youngsters. Finally either he
or Hansen attempted to frighten the chil
dren by telling them that If they did not
run away they would be kidnapped.
Soon it was reported about the street
that the two strangers were kidnappers,
or worse. Following that the report,
which has been demonstrated to have had
absolutely no foundation, was circulated,
that insults had been put upon some of
the little girls.
These stories found belief among- the
men in the neighborhood. In the evening
reports to the detriment of the detectives
multiplied and a delegation of young
men, who believed that Verdu and Han
sen were molesting children, warned the
detectives to leave the neighborhood. The
men moved off down the street stopping
In front of No. 357, where they eat upon
an iron fence.

In an application for a modification of
the decree of divorce granted her last
July from Edward Bruce Elliott Lillian
Elliott says that her husband fears to
return to this city because he la Indebted
to the firm of Goldberg, Bowen & Co.,
his former employers, In the sum of $900.
She says he fears prosecution and will
never pome back and for that reason she
asks the court to modify her decree of di
vorce by awarding her the custody of
the child, who was given into Elliott's
custody in the original decree.
A suit for divorce was filed by Mabel
Trask against Henry C. Trask. They
were married in August, 1900. According
to the complaint Trask,- abandoned his
wife in April of the following year. De

by Edward Shay against Mary Shay.
A divorce for desertion was granted to

FEARS PROSECUTION.
It was not until 1897 that the cats were
brought In Colson's unhappy life. In that
year Mrs. Cclson developed a fond
ness for cats of every degree and
fairly filled her house with them.
Some were sick, and they were all
dirty, but their condition only af
fected Colson. Every room In the house
was eoon filled with them and their num
bers increased, despite Colson's frequent
raids and attempts to kill every one of
them. Mrs. Colson cared only for the
cats, with the natural result that the Col
son home soon became a wreck. The un
lucky husband's friends for a time con
tinued their visits, but for a very short
time, and soon the visits ceased alto
gether. They preferred leaving him to
the company of his Wife and her cats to
running the risk of being infested with
vermin and having their clothes ruined
and their olfactory nerves shocked by a
call at the Colson home. It was early in
March, 1902, that Colson, driven almost
crazy by his wife and her cats, deter
mined to end it all. In March of that
year he left his home and came to this
city and established a residence. When
he was here a year he consulted a lawyer
and the suit was filed, which yesterday
resulted In the severance of his Irksome
bonds.
Such fights followed In rapid order dur
ing the next few years and he was finally
compelled to retire from business. Even
then he -was' not free from attacks by his
wife, for she wrote letters to his suc
cessor in business and to the guests of
the hotel, in which she said her husband
was guilty of all sorts of unseemly ac
tions.
QUARRELED OFTEN.
"Then you must have a divorce," cried
the lawyer. And the next day the suit
was filed. It was heard yesterday by
Judge Murasky, who promptly gave Col-
Fon a decree on the ground of cruelty.
Numerous depositions of Boston people
corroborative of Colson's tale were read
In evidence.
Colson's complaint is one of the most
complete recitals of the troubles of mar
ried life ever filed here. It recites that
he was married at Mattapolsett, Mass.,
in November. 1S7S. For fourteen years
he and his wife were happy. It was in
1832 that their troubles commenced. He
was at that time a prosperous hotel-keep
er at Â£ommerville. He did not live at his
hotel, but maintained a handsome resi
dence near by. His wish was that his
wife should take ur> her residence at the
hotel, but she would not. This led to
the first auarrel, and soon his wife was
making his life miserable by accusing
him of conduct unbecoming a good hus
band. She came to his hotel and insulted
his guests and one night broke up a -whist
party. She sa.ld the game was Immoral
and insisted that he should leave. She
compelled him to take her home and on
the way thither abused him, winding up
her tirade by kicking and scratching him
and endeavored to stab him with a hat
pin.
Once here. Colson set about making bis
emancipation final. He betook himself
to the ofllce of a lawyer and told his
tale of woe. The legal '.uminary was puz
zled, for he had never brought an action
against the feline tribe. He thought of
Injunction proceedings, mandamus and
even habeas corpus. But there was no
relief for Colaon in any of these proceed
ings. "Who owns these cats?" said the
lawyer, hoping for a response that would
aid him.
"Mrs. Susan Loring Colson, my wife,"
said Colson.
CONSULTS LAWYER.
A cat met him at every turn. An angry
"pst" and a chorus of blood curdling
"mews" greeted his every move. When
he retired at night he needs must exer
cise great care lest he should disturb the
slumbers of a feline snugly ensconced
between the sheets of his bed. When
he arose in the morning he had to
exercise great precaution lest he should
expose his bare feet to the claws of nu
merous pussies and provoke a melody that
would ring in his ears for the rest of
the day. In fact, every minute of Henry
Wyman Page Colson's time at his home
in Sommervllle. Mass., was spent in
dodging cats. For five years he stood it
and then fled to this city. Here he was
free from the presence of cats of all
kinds, whether they were costly Angoras,
pedigreed Maltese or members of the
Thomas and Maria family whose mid
night stunts would drive a deacon to the
xise of profanity and the most dignified
citizen to unseemly antics with bootjacks
and other prized- possessions.
P. H. McCarthy, president of the Build
ing Trades Council, was presented and
made a short address, predicting that all
those with whom he Â¦was most lntinuitely
associated, the laboring people, would
give their united support for the meas
ures.
Mayor Bchmits arrived late at the meet
ing, but when his presence was discovered
in the hall he was called to the platform.
He was given a warm greeting as he
strode up to the stage. His remarks were
brief, but he pointed out forcibly the
necessity for supporting all of the provi
sions mentioned in the bond issue, dwell
ing particularly on the moral necessity
of carrying the St. Mary's square propo
sition.
Following the addresses a series of ete
reoptlcon views were given, and the en
tire audience remained to witness them.
"We have a great continent at our back
rr.d a great ocean at our feet for the ex
ten'sion of our commerce, two elements
that with proper utilization will make San
rVancisco the metropolis of civilization,
population and commerce of the entire
world. Even now we are no longer in the
back yard of the nation; we are in the
front yard. California has the resources
to make it greater than Italy, and is cap
able of sustaining SO.OOO.OM or 40,000,000 of
people. Of this' vast empire San Francis
co must and will be the greatest city."
He expressed his unqualified approval
of every one of the provisions suggested
by the Supervisors, and especially plead.
c-d for the appropriation for St Mary's
square.
ELEMENTS OF GREATNESS.
WIT AND WISDOM.
Carl Sweisrert made a clever address,
altogether too ehort for the temper of his
ujdience. He seasoned his reasoning
with a plentiful sprinkling of wit, and
was frequently interrupted by prolonged
bursts of applause. Among the olher good
things, he called Ella JVheeler "Wilcox
â¢'one of the sweetest stenographers of na
ture." He eald that Telegraph Hill vras
rapidly being untclegraphed by the con
tractors and placed under the jurisdiction
of the rock-crusher. Speaking of land
marks, he said that Mr. Platt's Geary
street jauntirig cars had been running- to
the cemetery for thirty years, and they
were now going thither, never to return.
They would be added to the landmarks, a
plentiful supply of which were In evi
dence in Carville. Then the city would
Luild its own line, >rith underground trol
ley and overland speed and one seat per
I>assenser, not one eeat per â haps. The
speaker favored every one of the better
ments proposed, and clinched his argu
ments wittily.
Samuel M. EhoTtriage, always elo'quent
surpassed himself In pleading for the im
provements purposed by the bond issue.
"It is due to ourselves and our posterity*
he Bald, "that we make of San Francisco
the most beautiful city on this or any
other continent. By the foundation which
we lay shall those who follow us measure
the exertions which they put forth for the
betterment and beautiflcation of this city.
The demand for more parks, for better
streets and a complete system of sewers
is imperative.
Under the auspices of the California
Club women an enthusiastic and well at
tended meeting was held In Lyrio Hali
last night to forward interest in the forth
coming bond election, by which It is pro
poeed to appropriate more than 518,000,000
for the beautiScation and sanitation of
San Francisco. Some of the best speakers
in the Etate made addresses and some
splendid stereoptig^n view* were given,
showing how other cities had added to
their attractiveness by Installing parks
and places of public amusement
Mrs. George Law Smith called the meet,
ing to order and introduced State Sen
ator J. It. Knowland, president of the
California Landmarks League, as chair
man of the evening. After thanking the
audience for his welcome and expressing
his interest in the objects of the meeting
he Introduced John R. Benham, president
of the Labor Council, who made a short
but telling address. After reverting to
the necessity and advisability of support-
Ing every one of the provisions in the
proposed bond issue he declared that the
solid labor vote of the city would be cast
for them.
William H. Alford was the next speak
er. He made a stirring and echolarly ad
dress, portraying the growth of the city
from a strangling settlement to a great
mercantile center, that is destined to be
come one of the metropoles of the world.
He said he favored most, if not all. of the
provisions in the bond issue, but above
all he wanted the establishment of a park
on Telegraph HilL That wave-lashed
ornJnf nee, he paid, had stood for agos a
guardian of the Golden Gate; from Its
summit we had welcomed the wayfarers
and the commerce of the world, ft was
the first sisht that greeted the traveler
journeying to our city by all save one of
i he routes of travel. Its beautiflcation
was necessary to impress favorably those
who sought our shores. He closed with
a magnificent tribute to the "New San
Francisco."
The passengers will be protected from
the weather, there being no opening at
the western end of the depot where the
cold winds sweep in. The boats also run
under hoods on entering the slip, so that
passengers are protected from the
weather at all times.
All the trains running from the pier
will be handled from a dispatcher's office,
located on the south side of the depot.
Their movements will be directed from
this point by telephone with the other ter
minal points and stations en route.
The slip site has already been marked,
in keeping with the Government regula
tions, with the customary red and green
signal lights and a fog bell, all operated
by electricity.
The train shed at the pier carries three
tracks, which are at right angles to the
ferry-boat gangways. Much time Is ex
pected to be saved by this, as it will fa
cilitate the transferring of passengers
from the boats to the trains.
The first of the new cars to be used on
the new Emeryville ferry line have ar
rived and but a short time will elapse
before a. half- hourly regular service will
be Inaugurated between Berkeley and the
city, which will t* the first of the lines
to be put In operation.
The officials of .the road will not Im
mediately make an attempt to secure
traffic from all parts of Oakland and
surrounding towns. For the first few
weeks it is probable that only the Berke
ley branch will be operated. Until the
road la in smooth working order a half
hourly time table will be all that will be
attempted. After that the twenty-minute
service will be installed and the runs ex
tended by the Ban Pablo-avenue line to
the center of Oakland.

The scientific school has fitted up a

There Is apparently, says Professor
Chittenden, no question that people ordi
narily consume much more food than
there is any real necessity for und that
this excess of food is in the long run
detrimental to health and defeats the
very objects aimed at. It Is with a view
to gathering as many facts as possible
on this subject that the study in question
is taken.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Sept. 26.âProfes
sor R. H. Chittenden, director of the
Sheffield Scientific School, announced to
day that through the courtesy of Secre
tary Root and Surgeon General O'Reilly
of the army the "War Department will
co-operate with the Sheffield laboratory
with a physiological study of the mini
mum amount of proteid, or abumlnous
food, required for the maintenance of
health and strength under ordinary con
ditions of life. In carrying out this'pur
pope twenty men have been detailed from
the Hospital Corps of ttfe army and will
be in New Haven next Monday, under
the charge of Lieutenant Wallace Dewitt,
assistant surgeon of the United Stat*s
army.
CHICAGO, Sept 26.â The centennial cel
ebration of the founding of the city was
formally opened to-night, when a ton or
two of red fire was burned on the street
corners In the attempt to give a realistic
imitation of the great Chicago fire.
To-night's conflagration was not exact
ly the success hoped for because of a
heavy storm which prevailed throughout
the time set for the burning of the red
fire. The rain fell in torrents, the wind
blew half a gale and nearly everybody
outside the man whose business it was to
feed the red fire sought shelter indoors.
Between the high wind which blew his
powder away and the rain that soaked the
balance of it in thirty seconds, the red
fire man had difficulties of his own. Not
withstanding all this, however, a vast
amount of crimson blaze was produced,
and the result was fairly satisfactory.
A large number of Indians, descend
ants of the tribes that formerly lived on
the present site of the city, are encamped
in Lincoln Park and will remain through
out the celebration, which Is to last, with
Intervals of more or less Intensity, until
Thursday night. There are to be aquatic
sports In Lincoln Park, a parade, recep
tions to old settlers and banquets.
For to-morrow, when, according to the
official programme, the feature will be
"divine services in the churches," fair
weather la promised.
Nine historic tablets were put in place
during the day.

Santa Clara May Be
* Moved.
Father Kenna, the President,
Talks of the Pros
pects.
Special Dispatch to Tha CaJL
SANTA CLARA, Sept. 28.â "The remev.
al of Santa Clara College is not improb
able." said the president, the Rev. Robert
E. Kenna, to-night in an interview witli
a Call representative.
"Several sites have been mentioned as
available in case removal is decided upon.
These are San Mateo, Menio Park, Moun
tain View, San Jose and Aptos."
In the latter place the Jesuit order
owns property sufficient to accommodate
the college buildings on a liberal plan.
"My preference,"' continued President
Kenna, is for Santa Clara and I shall op
pose removal to any other site until oppo
sition is rendered useless. This location
Is the scene of the labors of the early
educators who founded the institution
which has grown to proportions requir
ing greater accommodations. Other po
tent reasons impel ma to stand for reten
tion of the college at this point.
OBJECTS TO BEMOVAL.
"It would not be Santa Clara Colleg*
In any other place and the establishment
of a university on another site would ba
equal to beginning another institution.
There are many who are concerned in de
ciding the Question of removal and my
voice in the matter would be only one of
many. Those who advocate removal ar**
sincere In their judgment and I am not
sure but that they may yet succeed In
accomplishing their desire. The question
of site is not so important a factor ta
that of funds. \An endowment of $300,w0
for Santa Clara College would mean to
ua more than double that amount woul<l
to any other college, for our faculty, with
few exceptions, is of the priesthood and
their services are gratuitous.
"Already a substantial beginning has
been made on a fund for new buildings
and the matter -will be finally determines!
within the present year.
"In case the opinion of others prevail
and their suggestion of removal is adopt
ed. I would have the task of the selec
tion of a site. San Mateo would be my
choice. The site there contains 130 acren.
and lies to the east of Burlingame. It is
on an eminence overlooking the bay of
San Francisco and is a most admirable
site, having abundant water and sewer
faculties.
CHOICE OP A SITE.
"In case Mountain View is selected tha
location would be on the new spur of tha
Southern Pacific about to be built to
ward Saratoga. This latter would bo
about seven "or eight miles from Stanford
University. Mayfleld would not be con
sidered. Near San Jose Agricultural Park
has been mentioned. I would oppose that
bitterly. If I go out to look for a place
I shall not even go there. There are- soma
features that would recommend It, but
more than would condemn it.
"One reason more," said .the president,
"may be assigned. â¢Nazareth.* the pas
sion play of Santa. Clara, has become a
biennial ceremony at Santa Clara College.
\ssociations and surroundings could not
be transferred and it is these very points
that give reverential lmpresslvenesa to tlia
production of the great tragedy."
In conclusion President Keuna indicated
that friends of the Institution had formed
plans to raise a considerable endowment
fund for the college, which would enable
the trustees to proceed with the new
buildings at no distant date. Three years,
he said, would be required for their com
pletion.

I The Gadden Girl. 9
g Have you seen the Gadden Girl? Do you know anything about her? |l
Ej If you are a woman don't say that you never heard of her. for iust at [I
g the present time she is one of the most original creators of fashions in f
13 Uncle Sam's realm. She is the originator of the iridescent pearl for hair j
M ornaments and she wears them in quantity that is nothing short of amaz- j
|| ing. And what think you of the musical jewels? That is another of the 5
El Gadden Girl's fads. Tewels set to dulcet harmoniesâ a fad in itself suf- \
H ficient to make a belle of any srirl even less remarkable than the Gadden j
II Girl. While as for color schemesin dressâ However, pictures tell more {
|| than words ever can. in the descriptions of feminine raiment at anv rate. I
H therefore the front page of the next Sunday Call will be more eloquent I
Â£l than reams on reams of writing to the women readers. If you want to E
B see novelty in coiffure, novelty in jewelry, you won't miss the Gadden I
i Nor will you miss "The Woman of the World." by Colonel Kate. E
W which is an article conceived and written by this clever writer in this I
|3 clever writer's very best stvle. Moreover, it contains thinss that evcrv |

B And while on the sub'iect of bright, snappy articles that vou will be Q

I course you've seen the cats. Everybody, by the way, is talkine about H
I those cats .and next Sunday's Call contains a perfect love of a kitty. ij
fc But better than all else for those who want to read the literature that Â£3
I is most popular to-day and which will go far toward making up the clas- f 1
I sics of the future, there is no limit to the good things '1
r First there is a short story masterpiece by Jack London, the most y

I Next there is the fascinatinsr two-page story by Frank H. Spearman. |
I "The Nij?ht Watchman's Story." If you have read any of this exclusive |

I Then there are two full pages of "Half-hour Storiettes." the latest
Â¦ craze in literature. In other words that means eight more of the best
short stories that are beine written to-day. These alone would cost vou :

] the famous author of "Chimmie Fadden." It is "Lees and Leaven." t

By an accident almost unprecedented
Peter Bfehlsen lost his life yesterday
morning. He had gone to sleep some tlmo
!n the night under the apron at Lombard
street wharf, the place being sheltered
from the winds and comfortable enough
for a man who did not expect a bed. At
5:20 a. m. "W. S. Streeter, the night watch
man on the pier, lowered the apron to
receive freight from the steamer Tran
sit, and the apron counterweights, weigh
ing seventy-five tons, descended upon
Mehlscn's breast, crushing it to a pulp.
The body was Identified by a memo
randum book bearing the name and notes
indicating that he came from Los An
geles. He wa3 evidently a Scandinavian,
about 40 years of age.
Peter Mehlsen Retires to Slumber
Under a Counterweight and Is
Horribly Mangled.

The maiket was liberally supplied with most
descriptions of Fruit and was rather quiet, the
local demand being light and the shlpptr?
movement limited. Supplies of table Grapi-s
continued excessive and all varieties were
quoted weak. The canners purchased freely of
Muscat at $20 per ton and several lets of To
kay and black sold to wine-makers at $2(>C"
per ton. The regular wine Grapes were In
light receipt and moved freely at good prices.
Peaches In small packages continued plentiful
aid dull, but offerings in bulk cleaned up
quickly under a cood demand from cannera.
Good Apples and Bartlett Pears sold well
enough, but low-grade offerings dragged at un
steady prices. Quinces, 'Pomegranates and
Figs were and easy, while Prunes
were in small supply and firm. Receipts of
Nutmeg Melons and Cantaloupes were less
liberal than on the preceding day and prices
were firmer. Supplies, however, were sufficient
for all requirements. Blackberries were scarce
and hicher, but the other varieties arrived
freely and prices stood about the same as be
fore quoted.

The report of G. N. Salisbury, section di
rector. United States Weather Bureau, for the
Washington Crop Bulletin, week ended Sep
tember 22. Is as follows:
"The weather during, the week covered by
this report was mostly warm and dry, with
light frosts In exposed localities at night,
which, on the 14th and 15th, were damaging
to tender vegetables. On Saturday, however,
it began to be cloudy and cool, and showers
eet In near the coast. On Sunday, the 20th,
rain was general over the- western counties,
and In a portion of the eastern division of the
State. There waÂ« about an Inch of rainfall
in the Sound country, but east of the mount
ains the rain was light.
'The rain was heavy enough to again delay
haying, harvesting, threBhlng and hop pick-
Ing, and perhaps still further damage the hop
crop. Standing wheat was lodged and quite
badly chattered, and considerable of that In
the shocks was badly bleached. Oats and bar
ley will be somewhat discolored; otherwise not
materially damaged. The greater part of the
week was very favorable for harvesting and
threshing, and a great deal of that work was
accomplished. Most of the week was also
favorable for hop picking. The crop In the
Yakima country Is apparently good; that in
the western yards Is reported rather light.
"Cutting the third crop of alfalfa In the
irrigated districts, and the second crop of
clover In feme of the western localities pro
gressed favorably. Potato digging is well un
der way. Although, in general, the crop is
reported large and of good quality. In some
localities of the eastern division It Is light,
and in some parts of the western division
there are reports of blip-lit and rot.
"The rain has benefited pastures, root crops
and late fruits and vegetables. It has also
put the soil in very fine condition for summer
fallow seeding and fall plowing, although In
the drier districts of the eastern counties more
rain is yet needed for seeding. Harvesting
would have been over in all localities before
this but for the delay occasioned bv the rains.
A few good days will see it finished- in even
the latest districts. Much winter wheat is
now being sown, the weather being favorable.
Pears are now ripening and are a heavy crop.
Italian prunes are about ready for the driers.
Apples are reported only half a crop In sev
eral localities."

In dry goods shows little more activity from â¢
general buyers, the majority of whom continue

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Trading In table Potatoes was quiet, but
as receipts were light the market ruled steady
at about previous prices. A carload of Oregon
Burbanks came In, but was not placed on sale.
It will be marketed to-morrow. Sweet Po
tatoes were wall cleaned up and steady. Onions
were in free supply and dull at the previously
quoted rates.
The vegetable market was amply supplied
and rather weak than otherwise. String,
Wax and Lima Beans were suddenly plentiful
and prices had a sharp decline. Tomatoes ar
rived freely and were easy, as canners were
not buying being well supplied with contract
stock. A few lots of strictly fancy stock sold
up to 60c per box. but the general run of
supplies sold within the quoted range. Re
ceipts of Green Corn were light and choice
stock met with prompt sale, but poor quality
offerings, which constituted the bulk of sup
plies, dragged at easy rates. Cucumbers, Sum
mer Squash .and Okra were steady, while Egg
Plant and Peppers were plentiful and easy.

NEW YORK. Sept. 28.â To-day's stock
market was kept unsettled and feverish
by occasional signs of renewed liquida
tion of the urgent and preclpitatÂ» char
acter which threatened the situation on
Thursday and which was checked by yes
terday's measures taken by tha great
banking interests. The course of the* Lon
don market this morning indicated that
the stock purchased yeaterday for sup
porting purposes would ba for sala again
at any favorable opportunity. A disor
derly break in prices is dreaded for tha
panicky conditions which It might bring
about, but the feeling continues generally
that there is llauldation still to ba ef
fected. It is also considered undestr&bl*
to undertake any campaign for an ad
vance in the face of the money require
ments for the crops. The bank statement
was regarded as satisfactory, and espe
cially in the loan contraction of mor*
than S3.000.000. reflecting the- rood pro
gress made in the necessary process of
liquidation. Hopes are entertained that
this process will begin to be effective in
restoring the Impairment of credit which
has overhung: the market like a cloud
and infected all minds with distrust and
apprehension. The most notable selling
pressure to-day was in the United States
Steel securities. Baltimore and Ohio and
the local tractions. '
The news from the various crops and
the price movement of thÂ» great agri
cultural staples were convincing 1 assur
ance of a safe harvesting 01 a sufficient
supply to afford a good exportable sur
plus. The harvest of the year has been
looked upon for many months as a vital
point in the problem of the working- de
velopments in which capital and enter
prise had become entangled. This news
was taken advantage of to market stocks.
There was a large movement of cur
rency to New Orleans for the movement
of the cotton crop. This waa> regarded
as gratifying from a monetary and indus
trial standpoint, the early movement of
that crop insuring an increased supply
for money purposes and a rellnqulshment
of exchange bills to Increase oar demands
on foreign money markets. The freer
movement of eraln In the "West was sat
isfactory, for the same reason, although
it serves to turn the tide of the- currency
movement in that direction. Railroad
earnings and the statistics of railroad
traffic showed a high level of activity
and prosperity there. These apparent in
centives to buy stocks were without thÂ©
slightest effect. â¢ and tho demand for
stocks was seemingly paralyzed. On the)
contrary, every development of an unfa
vorable character was given close atten
tion nnd was decisive In shaping the spec
ulative sentiment. The speculative opin
ion In Wall street seemed to have set
tled down to a conviction that industrial
reaction and an . economic crisis were
foreshadowed. These Bloomy forebodings
find ho indorsement from trade authori
ties. Reaction is admitted, but the ad
missions are accompanied by assurances
that the normal demand for products Is
undisturbed and awaiting supply at a nor
mal price level, which had been exceeded
in the boom period.
It Is believed that many margined ac
counts which were tided over the sum
mer weakness in the stock market on
condition that they would be liquidated
at the first favorable opportunity havo
been forced to sale. Some of the col
lateral taken over by banks and other*
from firms is also said to have come upen
the market. But It is evident, notwith
standing reassuring statements, that pro
found distrust and apprehension have
taken hold of the speculators.
Bonds have declined in sympathy with,
stocks.

yesterday that while at this time, he did
not care to go into details, he admitted
that certain well known New York capi

taken the project outlined In the articles
of incorporation with the intention of con
structing a road as soon as the franchises
granting permission to do so were passed.
He said that, while the road presented
many engineering difficulties, it would
open up a picturesque and extremely fer

the company a fair revenue.
The road is to be standard gauga and
fully equipped with every modern im
provement.
Commencing at a tidewater terminal
near the Union Iron "Works the route will

The league has a force of eight men em
ployed, most of whom were born and
reared within sound of the mission's bell,
and each of these has given of his laborâ
his allâ to the cause so dear to him. Seven
of these patriotsâ and they are patriots in
factâ have given*, a'' week's 'toll. But even
with such help, money, and much of it, is
needed. The lumber has been purchased
from a mill on the Santa Lucias and is
now being hauled. But when paid for the
league's treasury will , be sadly depleted.
Therefore the following circular, signed
by J. R. Knowland, chairman of the Na
tive Sons of the Golden West landmarks
committee, and H. R. McNoble. grand
president of the Native Sons "of the Gold
en West, has been sent " to the various
parlors of Native. Sons in the State, hop.;
The California Historic Landmarks
League, organized two years ago, is now
actively engaged in restoring the pic
turesque old mission of San Antonio de
Padua, in Monterey County. The whole
countryside thereabouts is deeply inter
ested in the restoration of this most in
teresting structure within its boundariesâ
not even excepting Carmel Mission, for
San Antonio stands apart from every
other of these famous heirlooms of pas^
toral days, not only for its wonderful
story, but for its idyllic situation and
beautiful outline.
A committee composed of representa
tives of the local parlors of the Native
Sons of the Golden West met in N. S. G.
W. building last night for the purpose
of taking steps to observe the memorial
day of the order. William M. Maguire of
Stanford Parlor was chosen chairman and
Charles A. Boldemann *of California
Parlor secretary. These were subse
quently elected permanent officers of
the committee, with W. Hazell as
vice-chairman and J. L. Crittenden as
treasurer. A committee consisting of the
officers of the meeting and L. Hirsch. H.
Levison, W. A. Peake, Fred Mayers and
T. F. Flynn was appointed to arrange for
the memorial service, which is to be held
in Native Sons' Hall October 11, at 2
o'clock in the afternoon. D. L. Fitzgerald
of Pacific Parlor, A. Block of El Capitan
Parlor and William Growney of Rincon
Parlor were appointed a committee to ar
range for the appropriate decoration of
the graves of the members of the order
who sleep in the silent cities of the dead
in this and in San Mateo counties. The
exercises will consist of an address by
the president, vocal solos, an eulogy, call

The California Historic Landmarks League
(incorporated) was indorsed by the last Grand
Parlor, and its membership Is composed largely
of native sons and native daughters. No plans
for the restoration of any landmark are adopted
until cassed upon by competent artists ana
architects, thus insuring Intelligent restora
tion. Officers receive no remuneration. A re
port of the league's work,, as presented at the
last session of the Grand Parlor, will be made
annually.

ing that the response Â¦will prevent an en
forced cessation of work:
The committee will hold a conference
with a like committee from the majority
some time to-day or to-morrow acd the
committee will report back to the dele
gates at the meeting to be held in the
California Hotel on Monday evening, half
an hour before the calling of the Demo
cratic convention in the Alhambra
Theater. If its demands are not granted
another hot fight will be held in the con
vention.
Before the delegates went Into session
the chairmen of the various delegations
met in a side room and decided that It
was their duty to pass the entire matter
up to the members of the minority/
When the delegates were called to order
the discussion began. The minority is
willing to compromise, if it gets what it
asks for. It is willing to make the nomi
nation of Franklin K. Lane unanimous
and in fact every other office on the ticket
also, if the minority Is given its Just rep
resentation on the County Committee
Under the order of business adopted by
the minority a week ago forty members
at large of the County Committee were
to be appointed by Chairman Thomas W
Hickey. The minority wants something
to say about the reorganization of the
party and it demands that it be given its
proportion of members. If its demand is
granted, and it is understood that Mc-
Nab is willing to give in for the sake of
harmony and to prevent Lane from de
clining to head the Democratic ticket, the
minority will have at least twenty mem
bers at large on the committee. The
minority further asks that it be given its
percentage of the new Supervisors to be
nominated by the convention. This would
mean three for the. "Horses and Carts."
The minority also asks *or County Clerk.
Another conference between the minor
ity and the majority of the Democratic
Municipal Convention 'will be necessary
before harmony can be established In the
party. This was found necessary last
evening, when the minority held its meet
ing In the California Hotel. There was a
goodly attendance of delegates and the
discussion was animated. Joseph E.
O'Donnell presided and the session was
an executive one. Every one who was not
a delegate was barred, excepting James
H. O'Brien, one of the leaders In the bat
tle against McNab, who was allowed to
listen to the speeches, but took no part.
Charles Wesley Reed, Eddie Graney and
a few more Democrats who are deeply in
terested in the conflict among the Bour
bons were forced to cool their heels in
the corridors.
Harmony and the Democrats Still
Seem Separated.

THE OTHER LETTER.
Following Is a copy of the letter men
tioned in the foregoing communication:
San Francisco, Sept. 26, 1903.
J. E. Partridge Esq.. Chairman of the Re
publican Local Convention â Dear Sir: I high
ly appreciate the honor conferred upon me by
the nomination for Assessor unanimously and
to cordially tendered me by the Republican
convention, on September 24. 1903.
I regret to state that it will be absolutely
imiKvseible (or me to accept the. nomination
for the reasons stated by me in my letter of
September ~. addressed to members of the
Organization Committee of the United Repub
lican League who had conferred with me In
reference to mv acceptance of such nominaâ
tion if tendered by the delegates. I beg leave
to inclose herewith a copy of said letter.
Congratulating the party upon the excellent
work of the convention and upon the strong
ticket presented by It to the people of San
Francisco, I am for success and victory, yours
very sincerely. C. S. LAUMEISTER.
A. Ruef requests the organization com
mittee of the United Republican League
to grant him a leave of . absence until
November 3. The request from Mr. Ruef
is in writing over his own signature and
will be considered at a meeting of the
advisory council to-morrow evening. It
is common gossip at league headquarters
that: the committee will grant the fur
lough. Should Mr. Ruef at the expira
tion of thirty-five days aek for extension
of his leave'fhe request could hardly be
denied.
Charles S. Laumeister sends the follow
ing communication to the chairman of
the Republican convention:
After the nominees for Supervisors had
been chosen the motion was carried that
the convention should adjourn until next
Thursday night, when the remaining of
fices on the ticket will be filled.
The afljoumed convention of the Union
Lfc-bor party, held in Pioneer Hall, was
slow In starting last r.'.ght, but once un
der way everything ran smoothly. Before
the meeting was an hour old John E.
McDougald. tha Republican nominee for j
Treasurer, had received the unanimous !
nomination by the Union Labor party, ;
and the eighteen Supervisors were being ;
balloted for.
When Chairman Williams called the
conx-entlon to order the roll call and read- j
lr.jr of minutes of the laÂ«t meeting- were â¢
quickly dispensed with. E. J. Deaver of i
the Thirty-sixth District then arose to i
make the nomination of McDougald. His '
speech was brief and to the point, merely
citing: the respect with which the nom- ;
inee was held as president of the Marble
Cutters" Union and secretary of the Build-
In* Trades Council. When McDougald's
Â¦sne was mentioned the convention was
aud In its applause, and several delegates
vrero on their feet In an instant to second ;
the choice. "William Mindham of the "
Twenty-eighth and Assemblyman J. N.
Copus of the Thirty-second district were
recognized by the chair and mabe the
ec-conding speeches.
F. W. Meyer of the Fortieth then moved I
that the nominations be closed and that !
the nomination of McDougald by the con- |
ventlon be made by acclamation. Such '
Â¦ft as enthusiastically voiced as the will of j
the convention.
To proceed with the selection of noml- '
xiees for Supervisors the order of business
vas laid aside. Each chairman cf a dele- .
gatlon procured the ballots for his asso- 1
elates, and a recess of ten minutes was
taken for the preparation of ballots. Then
e.s the delegates' names were called they '
registered the ballots. Chairman Wil
llama appointed as tellers of the election â¢
Vincent Bello of the Twenty-eighth. |
James A. Wilson of the Thirtieth and C. !
A. Lovle of the Thirty-sixth District. H. ;
Menke of the Flrty-second was appointed
Judge of the election. There were 143 bal
lots cast.
From the beginning of the count it be
came evident that the slate for 'Super-!
visors had been arranged beforehand, j
The first eighteen names on the list went ;
through the count in or,e-two-three order. .
A. F. Dlssmayer cf the Thirty-first, Fred

me pleasure to testify to the ef-
ficacy of your Kidney and Blad-
der Cure. I have been troubled
with my kidneys and bladder for
over four years. I have been
treated by the best physicians of
this city during that time. (I
mention two who stand at the
head of the profession, viz.. Dr. C
A. Purdy and Dr. Frank Walls,
the latter being my son.) I re-
gret to say they did me no eood.
I was advised to spend the winter
In your glorious climate and try
the ocean baths. I visited San
Diego, Santa iionlct. and Santa
Barbara, but received only tem-
porary relief from -*e baths. On
the night I left home I got a
< bottle of your medicine. The first
dose did me good, and I was well
when I reached home, and I can
say in conclusion that I am grate-
ful to you. If this letter is of

LONDON, Sept. 26.â The increase in thÂ«
number of women's clubs in London la
said to be attended by an alarming In
crease In the drinking habit, and thÂ© Lon
don "World said recently that liquor drink-
Ing, especially creme de menthe, had
grown to a grievous extent.
At these clubs one sees mor* whiskies
and sodas on the table at luncheon than
one sees at men's clubs, in which there is
a marked decrease in drinking. The club
managers, of course, deny these allega
tions, but they are known to bÂ© none th#
less true In the main.
Liquor Habit Grows.
Coming almost dally in contact with
Don Carlos, the Queen's eldest daughter,
Maria de las Mercedes, Princess of the
Asturias, who was then 17 years old and
on account of the very retired life to which
6he had always been subjected at court
had never before had an opportunity of

The young captain of the staff then lit
tle dreamed that capricious Dame For
tune would Just choose tne way to his
stomach In order to approach . him and
lead him to the very steps of a throne.
Yet such was the case.
The Infanta Isabelâ who at that time
lived at the palace with the royal fam
ily â was very much moved by the story
of her nephew's difficulties, and now de
cided to speak In his favor to the Queen
Regent, Dona Maria Christina. Her Maj
esty, willing to assist her sister-in-law's
protege, but at the least possible sacri
fice of her purse, proposed to the Infanta
Isabel that Don Carlos should come and
dine with them at the palace whenever
he pleased, and Don Carlos gratefully ac
cepted this offer, and was thus enabled
to wipe out from his list of expenses the
Items which referred to dinner and at the
same time daily satisfy the voracious ap

ing necessities; consequently, even after
having again repeatedly appealed, and not
in vain, to the generosity of his aunt, the
day came at length when he saw him
self compelled, as a last resort, to visit
the latter and confess to her his serious
and constant embarrassments for want
of money.
The "Queen was agreeably surprised by
the first of these petitions, but did not
show any surprise at the second one, for
she had already suspected the mutual.af
fection of her daughter and Don Carlos,
as she was always present when they
held their long dally conversations at des
sert, and after remaining for a
few moments she replied with tender ac
cents: "The first of your petitions, which
does you a deal of honor, shall be attend
ed to. You shall embark in the first
steamer that leaves Spain for Cuba. Re
garding your second petition, I can at
present only say that while you are in
Cuba I shall speak to Mercedes about it.
and then meditate concerning this serious
matter. "When you j have returned, after
having fulfilled. what you Justly consider
to be a soldier's duty, I shall give you a
more explicit answer."
After having said this Maria Christina
dismissed Don Carlos, first giving him her
hand- to kiss, and glancing at him with
a smile that was full of promise. With
in a fortnight the young captain embark
ed for Cuba and during his absence, which
lasted a little over a year, the Queen con
sulted Mercedes, who resolutely replied
that she would "either marry that man or
no. one."
In view of such a decided answer Maria
Christina began to think the matter over
carefully, and she doubtless must have
considered that her family being com

that which she so graciously feels for

Nevertheless, either because living is
excessively dear in Madrid or because the
young officer, as member of a royal fam
ily, could not decorously lead a too strict
ly modest and economical life, it is cer
tain that Don Carlos had not always suf
ficient money to defray all his expenses;
his limited captain's pay did not go very
far, and eo It happened that he was oc
casionally obliged to borrow such small
sums as two or three dollars of his most
intimate friends and comrades, and there
are still to-day various distinguished offi
cers In the Spanish army who, if they
cared to be Indiscreet, could boast of hav
ing provided the present Prince of the
Asturias with means to -buy himself a
new uniform of a pair of boots or gloves
of which, for some ceremony or other at
the palace, he was In urgent need.
But for the very reason that Don Carlos
had to present himself at court (where
he had been admitted from the begin
ning) as time passed the small loans
which he received from his companions
soon &roved Insufficient for his incrcas-

Caserta (brother of the dead ex-King of
Naples and' Sicily, Francis II), Don Car
los de Bourbon, when still very young,
was sent to Spain with his elder brother,
tho BO-called Duke of Calabria, so that
his aunt, the Infanta Isabel (also aunt
to King Alfonso), might take them under
high protection and procure them means
of living and an education worthy of
their rank, which their father, the Count
of Caserta, having seven sons and pos
sessing only a meager fortune, would not
have been able to give them.
The Infanta Isabel, whose good nature
is Inexhaustible, interested herself ; a
great deal for her two nephews and had
them' admitted, at her own expense, into
the Academy of Artillery of Segovia,
which they left after three years' study
as officers; and then she used all her In
fluence In favor, of the Duke of Calabria
until she succeeded in marrying him to a
very wealthy German princess. As re-
E^ris Don Carlos, the Infanta Isabel, un
derstanding that thÂ© youth could not live
very well solely depending on the scanty
pay of a lieutenant of artillery, made him
a monthly allowance; besides, in the hope
that he would one day also make a good
match, she solicited and obtained for him
a place in the HJgh School of War, and
after having finished his studies there,
he was promoted to the rank of captain
of the staff.
On the other hand, in the days which
preceded the wedding the poor captain
could not have had much time to take no
tice of those manifestations of discontent,
fbr the preparations^ for his * wedding
caused him such serious preoccupation,
because, although it is true that the valu
able Jewels and rich dresses which he of
fered to his august bride were bo'ught for
him by his protectress, the Infanta Isa
bel, still it is equally true that, he had to
think of buying his own personal effects.
So Princess Mercedes and Don Carlos
"de Bourbon were married on the 17th of
March, 1901, and everybody will remem
ber the violent manifestations of hostil
ity which this wedding provoked in Ma
drid and all over Spain, because the lib
eral elements of the kingdom protested
.against the Princess, who was heiress to
the throne, being given in marriage to the
son of the same Count of Caserta who
when he was general of the Pretender
Don Carlos had taken part in two most
sanguinary civil wars, fighting against
liberty and the army of Alfonso XII, the
father of her who was now going to be
his daughter-in-law.
But these hostile demonstrations, which
caused numerous victims among- -the peo
ple,' did not matter to tfcÂ© Queen, nor
to the Princess Mercedes, nor to Don
Carlos de Bourbon. The Queen only want
ed to please her daughter and. above all,
to show once more that ynen she had
Eet her mind upon doing a I certain thing,
nobody could prevent her \ from having
her own way. As for the Princess, she
thought only of marrying the man whom
she so dearly loved; the rest did not trou
ble her much. With regard tp Don Carlos
he must have thought that a few demon
strations of displeasure on the part of
the peop.le were nothing compared to the
advantages of becoming the husband of
an heiress to a throne.
AN TJNPOPTJXAR MATCH.
members, as Don Alfonso was still a child,
a man was really needed in the house,
but he must be a respectful and submis
sive man andâ above all â a person whose
'temperament and character Inclined to
keep him entirely aloof from state affairs
and allow the Queen Regent always to
do just as she pleased. Everything led
her to believe that Don Carlos possessel
all these qualities, which she so much do-
to see in her future son-in-law; con
sequently when he had returned from Cu
ba, the Queen announced to him and to
Mercedes that she gave them her consent
to be married.
But it ia only just to say that after
marrying Dona Mercedes the new Prlnca
of. the Asturias, either on account of hl3
pacific character or his want of energy,
had the tact never to meddle directly or
indirectly with political affairs, to show
himself In public only when accompany
ing his royal brother-in-law, Don Alfonso,'
as If he were his faithful tutor, and to
limit himself to the fulfillment of the
duties of a good husband. He usually
passes the whole day and whole night at
home with his wife and when the latter
happens to be ill he curses her himself.
Really, In case Don Alfonso should die
without leaving direct succession, the
Spaniards could congratulate themselves
on the harmlessness of the King-consort
they would then acquire.
Indeed, the future Prince of thÂ© Astuxiaa
must have been very "hard up" at that
period of his existence, becauseâ although
it seems strange â in the establishment of
a certain well-known linen draper In
Madrid ho was only able to order twenty
four shirts.

There was a little Incident recently that
showed how gracefully and mildly the
Prince can eit on a back Beat. It was
when AJ?onso XIII during his recent stay
Jn Cartasrena, wherÂ© he went to review
the now meager national fleet, paid a
visit to the famous establishment for the
extraction of silver which the ex-Liberal
Minister, the Count of Romanones, owns
In the town. The Count of Romanones
after having 1 conducted Don Alfonso to
visit various departments led him to a
very spacious room, where everything
had been prepared for melting an enor

who etood near I>on Alfonso heard a per-

the following words: "Gentlemen of the

But the Journalists, engaped In watching
the operation and listening- to the conver

no attention to the request, and Jt was
only afterward, wtien everything was
ended and the monarch was about to

highnesses and princes of the
blood, let rne commend the amiable man
of whom many Spaniards were in such
terror when he married within a step or
two of the throne and became what you
might call helr-ln-law-apparent. Really,
the Prince of the Asturias is not at all un
likely to become King consort of Spain in
fact, it not in name, painfully soon, for
there are increasing- indications that little
Alfonso, the unlucky thirteenth, has in
herited the consumption that killed his
father before the boy was born.
I have Just received from a particularly
well-ir.fonned correspondent In Madrid
details about this Prince of the Asturias
that make really entertaining reading In
view of the fact that his Royal Highness
is likely to be thrust forward so soon
from the back eeat where he modestly

Fiske' s reappearance in the play at the
Manhattan. The programme of the thea
ter for the first time disclosed the secret,
and announced as the author Mr. Wil
liam Winter, the dean of New York
critics and known for his literary works
wherever the English language Is spoken.
The turning of the prose of Paul Heyse
into the beautiful, poetic and sonorous
verse that marks the English form of
"Mary of Magdala" was an achievement,
and the interest that has been expressed
on all sides as to the Identity of the
scholar and poet who did It was natural.
The announcement of Mr. Winter's name
as the author has caused considerable
surprise, for although in the conjecture
as to who tho adapter might be the
names of many well known men of let
ters were mentioned.' his had not been
suggested in this connection. Not more
than half a dozen persons aside from Mr.
and Mrs. Fiske were in the secret, the
keeping of which for so long a period has
been contrary 'to usage in such matters.
Then arrangements were made by Mr!
Fiske for the publication of "Mary -of
Magdala" in book form. Mr. Winter
was persuaded to permit the use of his
name on the title page. The praise that
the lofty and scholarly verse of "Mary of
Magdala" ha3 received as <an anonymous
work was the best possible test of the
play's right to rank among English mas
terpieces. Mr. Winter's work in It even

"No, in Yale also," the professor inter
rupted eagerly. "They have there three
professors of music. I am greatly in
favor of a chair of muslo and^hope some
day that we shall have all the' arts under
our roof. I myself am fighting for the
cause of Greek letters and that leaves
me little time for the consideration of
the other arts. We have, I must tell you,
though, a new and highly promising de
partment of architecture Just founded.
John Galen Howard, one of the foremost
men In his line, is at the head of It."
"Perhaps he will be able to sav* us
from further crimes like that of smother
ing our City Hall in- a back- street!" I
hoped, then reverted: "Isn't this the only
Greek theater proper out of Greece?"
"It is bo far -as I am aware," the pro
fessor returned; "that in itself in rather
significant." â¢
"The whole thing is vastly significant
to me," I returned.
"The possibilities set one's imagination
on flre," the professor then exclaimed,
his face kindling. "Why cannot we have
Shakespearean cycles, the Wagnerian
drama, Beethoven's symphonies and those
things here? With 7000 of an audience
they could be given at the smallest
priceâ"
"Even at two obols a headâ "
"Even at two obols a head," he agreed,
smiling; "and think of the splendid ef
fect of putting these things before tne
people" as everyday fare. My mind is
simply full of the possibilities of the
place. There are Schiller cycles, the
French classicsâ we have the 'Phedre'
next week â and countless things besides.
I dare hardly express indeed the extent
of my hopes for our theater. -One modest
idea Is that it may become the cradle of
the national drama."
* "Ben Greet and actor after actor have
prophesied this for California," I con
tributed.
"But certainly the effect on the student
mind will be incalculably valuable," the
professor pursued; "the very beauty of
the. place must give birth to beauty and
its historic suggestion is of the noblest.
As I said before, my Vfalth in the effect
of the new theater is of extravagant
Bort."
"More of It, professor, and we should
not be so many eons away from our
Sophocles," I returned, then took my
leave of the gentle sage.
"But Bhould it?" and as fully as my
memory served I quoted Edward Mac-
Dowell, who expressed himself very forci
bly on the subject in a talk with me last
spring. Here Is exactly what he said:
"The citizen of the new republic must
know and honor music, yes; but paint-

must be considered a part of the well
rounded education. One may become a

he replied.

In the orchestra," he continued. "As a
matter of simple common sense, the
young men in charge of the affair ar
ranged for the performance to be given
in the orchestra, not on tho stage, as ac
cording to traditions. Curiously enough,
the greatest modern authority on Greek
tneaters. Dr. Doerpfeld, bears them out
in tniR. He has visited every Greek thea
ter and found no evidence of a stage ex
cept in later buildings than the Sopho

In the orchestra, and it was evidently es
sential for the actors to mingle with them.
Some one has said that the separate ac
tion of chorus and principals was too
much like a two-ringed circus to be
Greek!"
"But It was evidently not until after
the days of Sophocles and Aristophanes
that the elevated Btage came into use,"
he continued: "In so far therefore our
production of 'The Birds' on Thursday
will be historically correct."
"Your dramatic department here is

"In what Â«av?"
I found it very easy to gret te old Greece

Professor Clapp was kind enough to dis

Greek theater. We met him, tall, broad,
swinging easily along to the station on
his way to the city. But at my request
for a chat he turned back with ready
courtesy and took us to his charming,
Jasmlne-bowcred home on the campus.
"â¢Just ivhat is It you wish to talk

"Something like this." I replied, taking
in gratefully the tranquil suggestion of
the low room, the unhurried, unworldly
atmosphere of the professor himself. "I

It is made known, writes 'William. "Win
ter, that Mansfield intends to open hla
dramatic season at the new Lyric Theater
in New York in October with the play
of "Old Heidelberg." deferring to a more
appropriate season his new drama on the
grim subject of "Ivan the Terrible." This,
obviously, is a propitious arrangement for
the public. The play of "Old Heidelberg"
tells a simple, sweet, romantic, touching
story, and doubtless Mansfield's adapta
tion of the German original will do Jus
tice to Its characteristic German blendlnff
of poetry, symbolism, Joviality, senti
ment, sadness and humor. The character
of the Prince seems exactly suited to
Mansfield's peculiar temperament and
style and it could .not have been more
fortunately chosen; for no English

it over contemptuously and then returned
it with the remark that he had been en
gaged to play comedy parts. He laid par
ticular emphasis on the word "comedy."
"It is a comedy part," said the stags
manager.
"I don't see where the comedy comes
In." said Harlan.
"You are supposed to make the part
funny," said the stage manager.
"Oh, I am. am I?" demanded Harlan.
"All right. Til do it." He concluded to in

Taine. Ho ascribes thÂ© Intellectual ef
florescence of Greece directly to its cli

"Taine put it that talent was as much
a product of a 'belt' as an orange," I re
called.
"Cousin saysâ you remember the map of
Greece?
"I don't remember when I saw it last,"
I laughed, and the professor strode to
the bookcase and made me feel a small
girl again by pointing out those numer
ous seas and gulfs that took such a long
time to draw!
"You see, the sea everywhere Invites to
commerce, to adventure," the neo-Greek
eaid. "The mountains may bo easily
climbed, the climate is gracious, every
thiug Indeed inspires man to trust In him-
Belf, to do things, to go ahead. Greece
was therefore the natural home of art,
just as Central Asia, with its frowning
mountains suggesting the Impotence and
littleness of human effort, was the na
tural cradle of the great religions."
"You have recently been in Greeceâ is
it really very like California?"
"Singularly like," the professor con
firmed. "The contour of the bare, brown
hillsâ the Greek mountains are, however,
much larger than our foothills hereâ the
atmosphere, the general coloring, the cli
mate, are all curiously similar. Then,
too, there is the striking fact that Greece,
like California, has and had for staple
products, wine, oil, flgs and olives."
"Remains only how long to produce a
Sophocles? 1 ' I laughed.
"Ah, that I don't know," the professor
laughed in turn. "But â curiously again â
I have never had better pupils, more deep
ly interesting in the Greek thing, than I
have had here. Our high Bchools, unfor
tunatelyâthis reminds meâ hardly give
the facilities for the study of Greek that
they should."
"Still, new Greece Bhould not bo old
Greece "
"There is not the smallest danger of the
yourig people of California becoming
imitators!" exclaimed the professor. He
looked quizzically reminiscent of con
flict (?) with the willful, native original
ity. "But you get your best art by build-
Ing upon the art of the ancients, by an
enlightened use of their knowledge."
"Now as to the special bearing of the
new theater?"
"I should like first to correct the use
of the term 'amphitheater,' that has been
so freely applied to our theater," the pro
fessor said, something of the pedagogic
slipping Into his manner. "It is In no
sense an amphitheater, that is, of course,
a completely circled auditorium. The
amphitheater was a Roman innovation,
for entertainments in which it was not
essential for the actors to face the audi
ence, as in the drama. Ours is almost a
pure Greek building, modeled largely, by
the way, on the theater of Epidaurusâ
E-p-i-d-a-u-r-u-s."
"Thank you," I laughed.
"Epidaurus came to be a dramatic cen
ter naturally enough." the professor went
on. "It was a health resort, where the
"best people' went to get the advice of
Aesculapiusâ A, E "
"I think I remember," I laughed.
Then Professor Clapp laughed and apol
ogized: "I had a reporter here a little
while ago, and I spelled everything for
him but 'Ithaca'â and he got that
wrong!"
"The poor omniscfent!" I sighed for the
man who must know everything from
the. Sapphic odes to the argot of the
Barbary Coast. "But Epidaurus was a
particular center of light and learning?"
"Yes, and its theater particularly beau
tiful," the 'professor replied, "as I think
ours is."
"But marble?"
"But marble,"
"Have you been In the theater of
Dionysus at Athens? I am curious about
its wonderful acoustics.'*
"Yea, and I have stood in the orchestra
of one even largerâ said to have held
40.000 peopleâ and made my voice heard to
it* furthest limit." the professor re
called, "and that without any very stren
uous effort. You know the old Idea of
there being a sort of megaphonic arrange
ment in the Greek actor's mask is now
exploded, the theories of the sound Jars,
wires and so on."
"There was no necessity for them?"
"No; the acoustics of the theaters
themselves were all bo marvelously /good.
Then again the Greek actor was chosen
chiefly for the power and beauty of his
voice."
"And the Greek audience was almost as
fastidiously exacting about his diction as
the late Alfred Ayres about the modern
thespians?"
"Rightly so, too, for the stage should
be the model for the art of pure speech,"
the professor put it. "That is not the
least of Ha functions. But you will see
how vitally necessary clear diction was
in the old Greek days with audiences of
30,030 people. The actor, wearing a mask,
could not depend for his effects on facial
expression. NeitAer was the art of ges
ture as we know it among the player's
tools. There was left to him then little
but his voice to interpret the great dra
masâand jiet that seems to have been
magnificently sufficient. If only we had
a phonographic record of their voices!"
The modern note came oddly.

One of the reasons why some of the

a desire to tread the byways of Bohemia.

take its place.. Fortunately, we have not
