WINXEilUCCA, Nev.. Aug. 20.â Sheriff
Lemb of Humbolfit County rounded up
four criminals early this morning at Love
lock. They are members of an organized
band that has been operating through
this section very successfully for some
time past. The desperadoes boarded two
freight trains near Oreana. fifteen miles
east of Lovelock, and after robbing the
train men beat them and threw them off
the swiftly moving cars. Patrick "Welch
of Palisade, Nev., was shot three times
after being robbed; once In the back, the
bullet entering the left lung, once In the
left forearm and once in the left leg.
all the bullets ranging downward. He
died here this evening at the County Hos
pital as the result of his wounds.
Sheriff Lamb arrested four men at Love
lock, all of whom he had be*n -watching
for some time. They were broujrht to
"Winaeniucca this afternoon and Identified
by Welch. Welch pointed out the man
â¢who shot him. He picked the four high
tvaymen out of a crowd of men brought
before. him. â . â. r * n *â¢ .
The robbers have also been identified
by another of their victims. They gave
their r.-xzr.cs as Fred Roberts, John P.
Eevner, T. P. German and Frank' "Wil
liams. Roberts is a mere bov and was
pointed out by Welch as one of those
â¢who shot him. Wii;iams is a Nevada ex
convict, having been sent to prison from
this place two years ago for robbery.
The four persons â¢were also Identified as
having been Implicated in the stealing of
the grip of Mr. and Mrs. Harvey Murton
of Montreal. Canada, which contained
{2000 worth of Jewels and $400 in currency.
The grip was stolen on the morning of
August Â»13 from a passenger train.
Another member of the gang Is re

mento this evening. A diamond brooch
Â¦was pawned at Reno a few days ago by
one of the men. The Reno Jeweler will
arrive here to-morrow to identify the man
â¢who pawned the Jewelery.
The capture of the criminals breaks up
one of the worst gangs that has operated

HUGE IMPORTS
OF PRECIOUS STONES
Diamonds Form Five-Sixths of the
$30,000,000 in Value Com
ing In Last Tear.
More than $30,000,000 worth of diamonds
and other precious stones were brought
Into the United States In the fiscal year
just ended. The Department of Com
merce and Labor, through its Bureau of
Statistic statement, shows that the total
importations of diamonds and other pre
cious stones in the eleven months ending
with May amounted to over $23,000,000 in
value, and as the figures for the month
of May alone were about $3,000,000, it is
evident that the June figures will "taring
the grand total of diamonds and other
precious stones up to a full $30,000,000 for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1903.
This is the largest importation of dia
monds and other precious ftor.es ever
shown in a single year of our commerce.
Prior to 1S87 the total had seldom if ever
reached $10,000,000 per annum; from 18&7 to
1SÂ«3 the total gradually moved upward un
til It reached fl6.0u0.000; .then it rapidly
fell to $5,500,000 in 1S94; $7,500,000 in 1895;
$6,750,000 in 18S6. and $2,500,000 in the fiscal
year 1897. In 18*8 the total Increased to
r.c-arly $9,000,000, in 1899 to over $14.0')0,000.
In 1901 to $22,000,000, in 1902 to $23,000,000, and
in 1903 will be fully $30,000,000, making the
tolal for the year Just ended not only
more than in any preceding year, but 50
per cent In excess of 1301. double the fig
ures in 1899, and more than six times the
average during the period of 1891-97.
This rapid growth in the importation of
diamonds, while it suggests general pros
perity, seems to indicate the development
of a comparatively new industry in the
United States, the cutting of diamonds.
The total importations of diamonds alone
in the eleven months ending with May
amounted to $24,000,000 and of other
precious stones M.500.000. Of the $24,000,000
worth of diamonds imported, $10,000,000
were uncut diamonds; this total of $10,
000,000 of uncut diamonds is a large In
crease compared with the importations of
uncut diamonds in preceding years, the
figures for eleven months of the year 1902
being $5,500,000, while for the correspond
ing period of 1901 they were $6,600,000; for
the corresponding months of 1900. $3,500,001),
and for the corresponding months of 1898
but a little over $2,000,000.
The diamonds imported are divided by
the Bureau of Statistics statements into
two groups, y\r.'. Diamonds uncut, includ
ing miners', glaziers' and engravers', not
set, and diamonds cut but not set. The
value of diamonds uncut, 1 including mln
erB\ glaziers', etc., imported in eleven
months ending with May, has grown frOm
$2,500,000 in 1898 to $10,000,000 In 1903, while
that of diamonds cut but not set has
grown from $4,000,000 In '1898 to $14,000,000 In
1903, these figures being In each case for
the period of eleven months. This'Infer
ence, that the cutting of diamonds ts be
coming an Important industry in the
United States, which is suggested by the
rapid Increase in the importation of un>
cut diamonds, is strengthened by the fact
that the census statisticians "lapidary
work" show that the total value of pro
duction of lapidary work in 1900 was over
$3,500,000, against less than -$500,000 In 1890
and that the value of the materials-used in
this .work In,. 1900 was over $4,Â§00.000,
against less than $25,000 in 1890.â Pittsburc

"The eyebrows also afford another
means of personal Identity, because they
are invariably distinctive and character
istic to the trained detective. About
three years ago I captured one of out
cleverest crooks, a man who has served
many terms lri Sink Sing, by the peculiar
slant of his eyebrows. At the time I ar
rested him he was wearing a wig and a
flowing black false beard. The disguise
might easily have deceived the casual ob
server, but .to me there, was - one thinjr
lacking to make it complete. Ke had for
gotten to alter his eyebrows, and they
alone gave me the cue to his identity.

a rich haul somewhere will pay liberally
for effective disguises. A few facial artists

"I can easily spot a pickpocket In a
crowd," said one of New York's detec
tlvesj who has been attached to the de
tective bureau at police headquarters for
the last fifteen years, in conversation with
a reporter the other day. "It Is not neces
sary that 1 know my man by sight first
before I can spot him. A thief, as a rule 1 ,
you know, has' a habit of glancing fre
quently over his shoulder In a furtive man
ner to see that he is hot being watched,
and it is by that habit that a thief has
often betrayed his occupation to me.
"Frequently I have had to track and
Identify men whom I have never seen, my
only means of Identification being a pho
tograph taken years ago. This is usually
very difficult to accomplish, however, as
It Is easy for the criminal radically . to
charge his appearance. It Is p'ossible for
a man to pose as a sailor, a farmer, a
Bowery tough or a pastor within, say,
twenty-four hours. Many criminals make
a specialty of disguises, and I assure you
they can alter their appearance to a re
markable degree.
"Disguises, however, ho matter how
cleverly got up, do not always conceal a
man's identity. There are, for instance,
the color artd expression of the eyes.
These cannot possibly be altered, and
they have been oho of the most frequent
aids in identifying fugitive criminals. An
other Identification mark, although not an
infallible one, but one nevertheless J by
which I have on several occasions detect
ed a criminal when other means failed
me, are the cheekbones. Like the color
of the eyes, they cannot be changed.
"Descriptions as to the weight and cir
cumference of a 'wanted', man frequently
prove faulty and therefore unreliable as
aids to detection. 'This Is especially so"
when a man has evaded the detectives for
any great length of time, for It Is possible
that during his evasion the criminal may
have lost a great deal of his weight and
corpulency, while, on the other hand, a
spare man may have gained in avoirdu
pois and bulk. In such cases, however, I
have in one or two instances established
the identity of the man I was after by
his ears. As a rule, the worst criminals
have oddly shaped ears, and no matter
how cleverly they may disguise them
selves they can seldom succeed In con
cealing their telltale earmarks from the
detective who has already made their ac
quaintance.

Millions "of umbrellas are manufactured
in the United States every year. The
largest ...factories are in Pennsylvania.
The great jobbing" houses are bunched
along Broadway, near Canal street. One
of the big factories has a capacity of 7000
umbrellas dally. That is over 2,000,000 a
year.' Where do they go? "All over," as
a salesman put It. And'lf you glance up
and down New York's streets, especially

bridge, after a severe rainstorm you will
know. that It.is "all over" with many of
the umbrellas. .It does not take long to

gone inside out and the bars are hope

of course. There are good. umbrellas, that

handles and look as if they were made to
keep dry. But that Is not what they were
made for exactly. They were made to
present to the superintendent on his birth
day anniversary, to give to our rich aunt
at Christmas and 'as a memento, of our
regard for. our noble grand v lodge presi

â¢ That is the sentiment commonly enter
tained toward the transfer of this most
useful article of personal property. Few
consider it kleptomania and none" stealing.
Some ingeniously admit- that it is a bad
habit.
The. origin of the umbrella is very an*
cicnt. It was known in the Far lift st be
fore the time of Marco Polo, whence it
came to the West. Early in Ihe eighteenth
century it was first used In Western Eu
rope as a protection against rain. Jonas
Hanway in 1750 made a practice of car
rying an uirihrella hi the 'streets of Lori
don and created a constant sensation.
";The growth of" the umbrella Industry
has b>*n rapid in the United States during
the past thirty years. Authorities in the
trade agree that the manufacture was
commenced . here ab6ut 1S00 at Philadel
phia by E. J. Pierce, W.-A. Drown and
Edmund Wright. It did not progress very
rapidly until about 1S03. Prior to that date
the materials used in the manufacture
were, mostly Cotton and alpaca. But five
years Â¦ earlier, or "about I860, American
manufacturers began to use silk. Pre
vious to that time all or nearly all silk
umbrellas used in this country were im
ported from Europe. At the present time
the estimated total amount of capital In
vested Is placed at $3,000,600, as compared
with $1,000,000 twerity'-flvÂ£ years agp and
$250,000 fifty years apo. The approximate
total number of umbrellas manufactured
In the United States aggregates 9,000.000
per annum. In many respects umbrellas
manufactured In this country excel those
of any other, but particularly as regards
finish, neatness and close r611.

The skilled carver in this city usually
makes his own tools, forges* them In the
worksnop, tempers, grinds and polishes
them ready for u*e. The Japanese carv
ers use much the same methods as the
Germans who work beside them. The pay
nf the skilled carver Is excellentâ from
$3 to $10 a uayâ according to the charac
ter of the work and the ability of the
carver to Impress his work lipon his em
ployer. There are unions 'of the artistic
carvers, but the ablest of tnem have no
need of. union aid In maintaining their
rights.
Few Native-Bom Americans En
gaged in the Tedious
Work.
The trade of the carvers In bone, ivory,
meerschaum and like materials has never
fully recovered from the blow it received
In the hard times beginning In 1S98. There
were at that time probably more than 300
such carvers working in New York. Many
of them were driven out of the trada
into other and cruder lines of carving,
and only a few of those who thus changed
their medium have been able to find work
of thÂ« old kind. Only a very small part
of those who do such carvlrig belong to
the class of true artists in Ivory, bone
and meerschaum. Of such highly skilled
carvers the whole number could probably
be counted on the fingers of two hands.
The business grows very slowly. There
are few native Americans who have mas
tered the craft. Possibly a single em
ploying carver, a native American of Ger
man parentage, is the only one now en
gaged in the art. Only two skilled Jap
anese carvers are employed In. this city,
and no Chinese carvers have come to
j town. Most of those engaged In the art
are Germans, though a rew Frenchmen
r.ave worlceil here. ThÂ« Oe-rman-Amert
can referred to thinks that most Ameri
cans lack patience to become skilled
carvers. The .nmerlean haste Is antag
onistic to the attitude of mind that the
successful carver must maintain.
German carvers of taste and skill could
earn much higher pay here than at home,
and if more could come over they would
l.nd permanent employment, but they are
not attracted by condition* here. On the
whole, they can live cheaper In Germany
than here and amid more congenial sur
roundings. Another consideration that de
ters the skilled carvers from comlnz to
New York is the rumors their hear of
disagreements between employers and em
ployed, strikes and trammeling union
rules. Thev have a notion that trade
union conditions here are such 4 as to dis
turb the serenity of the artist. As a mat
ter of fact, the artistic carver would prob
ably be little disturbed by the wars of
employed and employer, but the news that
reaches Germany on this subject Is alarm-
Ing.
Chinese carvers of real artistic skill
would be very welcome here, but the dif
ficulties presented by the Chinese exclu
sion law help to keep them at home, for
there might be some trouble in having
such immigrants admitted ns Â«kllled art
ists. Then. too. the Chinese skilled carv
ers are a contented body of men. earn
ing good pay for China, and enjoying
some social consideration. Few of them
now have the skill of the earlier Chinese
carvers, and -many do only the crudest
work.

have taken the records belonging to the i
Stare. I will file a criminal complaint at !

"You should bear In mind these men
who are making charges are all dis

spots," eald Dr. Campbell to-night, "but
they have pone too far and have done
things that will land them in jail. The
law imposes a heavy penalty . for ab
stracting documents from State institu
tions. If Whit taker and Howard have
carried away books and papers belonging
to the records of the asylum they will be
vigorously prosecuted.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 20â Dr. M. B.
Campbell, medical superintendent of the
Southern California State Hospital at Pat
ton, acting under Instructions of Assistant
Attorney General John \V. Stetson, tswore
out search warrants to-day against the
former steward, C. N. Whittaker. and the
former drug-gist, F. \V. Howard, of that
institution to recover certain State rec
ords which are alleged to have been ab
stracted from the hospital. The issuance
of the search warrants is the first step
toward the criminal prosecution of the
two former attaches of the asylum. The
prosecution will be directed entirely by
the Attorney Generals department. The
warrant of search was served upon Whit
taker this evening at Monrovia, but what
was found as? a result of the search has
not been disclosed. The service on How
ard will be made to-morrow, arid then
such other proceedings will be Instituted
as the result may justify.
When Whittaker was deposed as stew
ard he threatened to file charges against
Dr. Campbell, but has reconsidered and
now protests that nothing could induce
him to again appear before the present
board of managers, whom lie Kays he dis
trusts. However, when he left the asy
lum it is alleged he took with him cer
tain requisition*- and estimates that are
a part of the State records. The absence
of these documents and a druggist's reg
ister, that F. TV. Howard confesses to
having in his possession, have handi
capped the hospital officers In their ef
forts to get at the bottom of the trouble,
hence Dr. Campbell's determination to
recover them.

It is of course mere elementary decency to
require that all Government departments shall

or non-membership in any labor organization

such organization.
Concerning this principle, the President
wrote: /

labor as follows:
Viscount Cranborne, eldest son of Lord
Salisbury, says his father was improving

from the Hook, returning on the Erin with
his guests. He was busy bidding them adieu,
but he stopped to say:
"No, I am not In the least disappointed with
my boat or Its efforts to-day. The wind was
so variable that neither boat had a good
chance, and particularly mine, with her smaller
sail area. Wait till we got a good breeze."
The yachts did not arrive at the Hook until
after 6 p. m. The captains refused to talk
for publication, and all that Mr. Iselln would
say was: "We were perfectly satisfied."

GLASGOW, Aug. 20. â Not since the contest
between the Thi6tle and Volunteer has there
been such excitement over the America's cup
races .as prevailed here to-day. The* streets
were filled with crowds which blocked all
traffic whenever the sight of a race bulletin
was obtainable. At Dumbarton the citizens
showed even more Interest. They have sub
scribed for a colored searchlight service by
which the results of the contests can be noti
fied to the surrounding country. The announce
ment that to-day's race had been called off
was received with bitter disappointment, but
there is a general feeling of confidence that
the Shamrock will make a better j showing on
Saturday.

the understanding that St. Louis is to be .
given the preference.
The committee on resolutions will be j

The feature of the morning session to
day was the address of Hon. Walter
Giesham of Galveston on "The Necessity
of First-class Harbors to the Commer
cial and Industrial Development of Our
Country." He spoke in part as follows:
The American people, until within the last
i>-w years, have been too busy extending rail
ruads. building' factories and developing their
country to ra>' much attention to foreign com- i
mg-cf; but now we are operating three-fifths ;
of the railroad mileage on our globe, our man- j
ufacturf-d products are greater than those of j
t)::g;an3. France and Germany combined, we
bir ra'.r:r.g in*? largest surplus of breadstuff. |
hog proiucts and cotton of any country In the
worH. and these products are transported
Â¦within our beniers at a less average cost per
ton than thop? of any other country. These
facts d^mor.Ftratc conclusively the necessity for
the early Improvement oz our harbors upon
plans commenfurate with the needs of the
mo.iern instrumentalities of commerce, so that
our surplus products may reach the markets of
the world with the lea.*t delay and the smail
tFt transportation charges possible.
We have entered the contest for the com
mercial supremacy of tho world, and every fa
cility that th* Government can extend must
ar.d will be provided by Congress. One other
thing is essential to insure our complete and
permanent success as a great commercial na
tion and that a merchant marine, manned by
American 5Â»arfc*n and carrying the American
flag. L*t Congress provide for deep and com
modious harbors and Â«-na<?t liberal ship reg
istryâand th*- genius of the American merchant
backed by American capital will eoon supply
thf* veFS*Â»ls.
An iiour was devoted to the irrigation

To-night the President authorized the
publication of a statement which was sent
to each member of his Cabinet on July 22.
The letter was signed by Mr. Barnes, act
ing secretary of the President, and is as
follows: ;
" OYSTER BAY, L. I., Aug. 20.â President
Roosevelt has made applicable to all de

principle he enunciated at the time he re
instated William A. Miller to' the position
in the Government printing office ' from
which Miller. had been dismissed because
of a disagreement with the Bookbinders'

Publication Is, Authorized of State
ment Sent to Each. Member, of
The New York Yacht Club regatta
committee's tug established a line be
tween the Sandy Hook Lightship and her
self at 10:30 a. m. and signaled that the
race would be fifteen miles to windward
and return, tho 1 first leg south-southwest.
The wind was then blowing about five
knots.
There was a moderate sea running in
long ground swells,' and the boats were
pitching rather heavily. The conditions
were unfavorable to the Reliance, judg
ing from her early trials. The Shamrock
III was expected to have the advantage
in the light wind and rough water condi
tions prevailing. The preparatory signal
was fired at 10:45, and ten seconds later
came the warning signal. When the
start was made, a few seconds after the
warning signal, the Shamrock III led the
American boat across the line by about
fifty yards, but the Reliance held the
windward position.
Official starting time:
Shamrock III 11:01:14
Reliance 11:01:47
Both boats sailed seaward for an hour
and twenty minutes. The wind dropped
to about four knots soon after the start.
Within twenty-five minutes after the
starting the Reliance had overhauled the
Shamrock and was abeam of her and 200
yards to windward. The Reliance had
not only footed faster, but pointed higher
than the challenger and was showing that
.under conditions supposedly unfavorable
*to her she was the better boat. Half an
hour after the start, when the-boats were
about four miles from the starting line,
rain swept across the course and obscured
the yachts from all " observers except
those very close. The shower brought a
shift of wind to the westward, which
enabled the racers to lay a course direct
to the mark. This robbed the Reliance
of most of the advantage of her windward
position and put the boats on'ttlmost even
terms. They held that relative position
until they had sailed eight miles, when
the wind backed to south by west, again
making it a dead beat to the mark and
restoring to the Reliance her former ad
vantage in being to windward.
CHALLENGER IS OUTPOINTED.
When they made their first tack at
12:20 the Shamrock III was to leeward
and asttrn a few hundred yards. The
shower had passed. Then, for the first
time, the British challenger gave the ad
mirers of the defender a bad scare. With
out apparent reason she began to foot
faster than the Reliance, passed to lee
ward of her and drew a^way ahead, but
still to leeward. It looked for a moment
as though she was going to show her
heels to the Reliance, but when she came
about and the two boats met the admir
ers of the Reliance discovered that, while
the challenger had been outfootlng her,
the Reliance had been outpointing the
challenger and had even increased her
lead. The bows were nine miles from
the starting line and the Reliance had
a lead of a quarter of a mile.. In aMrop-
CONDITIONS FAVOR SHAMROCK.
The course was set fifteen miles south
west, straight down the Jersey coast and
return. At the start Captain Barr. clev
erly outgeneraled Captain Wringe, send
ing the Reliance over the line sixty-three
seconds behind the challenger but in the
windward berth. In the first twenty min
ute.s of sailing the defender showed her
windward qualities, drawing up on even
terms witn the challenger, besides being
about 200 yards to windward. Then the
storm broke and for thirty minutes the
rain came down in torrents, the wind
meanwhile increasing to twelve knots.
When the storm had passed the defend
er was seen to be firmly established on
the weather bow of the Shamrock III and
she was never afterward "headed.
During the last two hours of the race
the Reliance steadily increased her lead,
rounding the turn a mile ahead of the
Shamrock. Heading back for home, close
hauled, she had Just reached the Sham
rock, still outward bound, when. It being
apparent that the race could not be fin
ished in the time allowance, the regatta
committee beat at 3:45 fired the signal
which declared the race off.
The work of the patrol fleet was perfect.
Moving at right angles, line ahead and
line abreast, the revenue cutters kept the
yachts in the hollow of a moving angle,
as free from interference as if they had
been sailing in mldocean.
Under the rules, the first race, fifteen
miles to leeward or windward and return,
is now postponed until Saturday.
The Reliance reached the starting line at
10 a. m. and dropped her tow line. The
Shamrock III arrived ten minutes later.
No sooner had the Shamrock filled away
than the Reliance bore down upon her
from a windward position and hauled on
the wind alongside of her In a position to
blanket the challenger. Captain Wringe
promptly wore ship and bore away from
the Reliance, refusing to take part in the
brush.
WEINGE IS OUTGENERALED.
N< EW YORK, Aug. 20.â One, of
the biggest crowds of sight
seers and yachtsmen that ever
sailed down Sandy Hook to
\ witness an attempt of a for
"* eign cup-hunter to wrest from
America the yachting supremacy of the
world returned to New York to-night,
disappointed because the sea had refused
.1 field of combat to the racers. Never-'
thelots, the crÂ«,wd was Jubilant in the
conviction that Sir Thomas Lipton's Jat
tr.t challengjr. like the two Shamrocks
which had preceded her, was doomed to
return to England empty handed.
Of course the race to-day was not ab
solutely conclusive owing to the light
and shifting character of the air, but in
a fifteen-mile teat to windward, a por
t.on of which was sailed in a driving rain,
tt e cup defenrUr Reliance showed her
beds to. the {"hiin.rock III in commanding
st; le, and that, too. in weather conditions
which were suppoted to be to the partic
ular liking of the challenger. Fife's lat
ost creation has been heralded as a won-
Cei In light breezes in windward wont,
and especially wl'.h a Jumpy sea on, while
the Reliance on l:er trials had done n^r
best reaching and funning in a wholesa"Â«j
Kind. Yet to-day with a breeze varying
f.om one to twelve knots and against a
k-ng ground swsll the Reliance outfootel
and outpointed the SJiamrock. The Sham
rock did not turn the outer mark an>l
there is no way of knowing absolutely
how badly she was beaten, but it was es
timated ttiat she was more than a mile
astern, or sixteen minutes In the exist
ing strength of the wind, when the Re
liance rounded.
As a result of the trial, the experts bt
l'eve. blow high or blow low, that the
Reliance will win this, the thirteenth se
ries for the America's cup.
The day was a miserable one. A mist
lay over the city and ocean and when th<5
gr^at fleet of excursion steamers, steam
yachts, tugs and sailing vessels reached
; the starting line, where the racers were
] already jockeying for a position, threat
ening clouds were hovering over the Jer
sey heights. The breeze was not over six
i knots.
Just at that point the regatta commit
tee's tug displayed the signal, "The race
is off," and the Shamrock III came' about
and followed the Reliance a short dis
tance. The Shamrock III never turned
the mark. They were taken in tow of
tugs and the fleet, hurrying homeward,
quickly dropped them.
Admirers of the Reliance are jubilant
because the American yacht demonstrated
that in extremely light airs and unusual
ly rough water she could show her heels
to the British challenger, and those were
the conditions believed to be the severest
test of. the Herreshoff boat.
The defender hauled on the wind for a
close reach back to the finish line, sa
luted by the whistles of the big fleet. The
Shamrock III was coming on at a fast
pace to meet the returning defender, but
she was so far astern that it was eight
minutes after the Reliance turned the
mark before the racers passed going in
opposite directions, indicating that the
Reliance's actual lead was sixteen min
utes. . Â¦.'Â¦"Â¦
When four miles from the turning mark
at 1:25 p. m. they started on a long leg
out to 6ea. . As they came about It was
apparent that the Reliance . was a mile
ahead. The wind had dropped to little
better than a flat calm, and the racers
were moving very slowly. The boats sev
eral times changed their head sails, but
the race degenerated into a : - drifting
match, and three'and a half hours after
the start it was evident that the race
could not be finished within the time
limit. The Reliance had steadily gained
and was two miles ahead of- her rival,
when the Shamrock Hi caught a little
wind from the west and began cutting
down the lead. The Reliance went about
when a mile away from the turn and,
catching the westerly wind, scurried
away for the mark with almost racing
speed. The wind continued to freshen
until she swept around the mark at 3:37:29,
heeling to a smart northwest breeze and
giving the first exhibition of her speed.-
ping wind the British boat twice slipped
past the Reliance to leeward, but she
was losing ground in the windward thresh
because the Reliance sailed closer to the

Last of Famed Pirates.
As late as the year 1525 the waters ad
jacent to Porto Rico were infested by a
bloodthirsty band of pirates led by a
Spaniard named Confrecinas. It was the
proud boast of the buccaneer chief that
he neither gave nor asked quarter. In
March of the year mentioned Captain
John Drake Sloat, who twenty-one years
later raised the American fjag over Cali
fornia, was placed in command of the
eioop of war Grampus, with orders to pro
cÂ«*ed to the West Indies and wipe- the pi
rates off the ocean. The Grampus cruised
for some weeks without catching Bight of
any pirate vessel. One morning while the
eloop was lying at anchor In the harbor
of San Juan a man who had swum ashore
from a merchant vessel captured by Con
frecinas reported that the pirate brig was
anchored In the Boca <5e Inferno (Mouth
of Hell), an obscure harbor some miles
up the coast, waiting to attack a heavily
laden schooner which was to sail from San
Juan that very day.
ConfrecinaÂ« knew the Grampus well, eo
to make sure of his prey Captain Sloat
placed a heavily armed crew and cannon
leaded with jrrape on board the schooner
and eallled forth. The pirates, unsus
pecting any resistance, bore down on' the
<3!&guised vessel with the black flag and
ftkull and cross-bones at the brig's mast
head. Not a. move Was made by Sloat
and his crew until the vessels were almost
alongside, when the marines arose from
the deck and poured a deadly fire into
{he brig. Confrecinas rallied his men and
for some time kept up a running fight,
showing great skill in manipulating his
crippled vessel. He was finally forced to
run his brig ashore. Forty of the crew
with the buccaneer chief were captured
by waiting soldiers. They were taken to
San Juan, court-martialed the next day
ond shot. Confrecinas was the last .to
die. When they attempted to bind hiÂ»
eyes he threw the men aside, ridiculed the
priest and exclaimed with a loud voice:
"I have plain hundreds with my own
hands and I know how to die. Fire." He
fell pierced by many bullets, the last and

his report:
There Is a . growing danger that Memorial

will continue to be remembered by kindred or
ganizations when we have all answered the
last rollcall. The graves of the Confederate
dead will also be the natural sMrine of devo

to come. But to whom can we bequeath the
sacred duty of dropping a blossom and a sym
pathetic tear on Memorial day upon the graves
of the 260,000 Federal dead who sleep on
Southern soil, and teach the lesson of patrio
tism, associated with them, to future genera
tions in the South? There Is scarcely a home
In the North but is represented by one or moro
of these fallen heroes, and to their kindred
and friends this is certainly a question of most
absorbing interest. It is evident that the main

loud cries for the new commander In

on the platform he was given an ovation.
When the enthusiasm subsided he said:
. I shall do in all ways whatever I can as
your representative to advance the cause of

man Is in the presence of the majesty of the
American people, but when I speak with your

Delegations were received from the
Woman's Relief Corps, the Association of
Army Nurses and the Ladies of the

The first- report of the afternoon was
that of the flag committee. This is a.
standing committee appointed for the
purpose of fostering public sentiment in
favor of honoring the national flag. It
recommended the passage of bills through
Congress and the different States for this
purpose. The report of the committee
was adopted.

sented a report 'on the subject of claims
of veterans tor preference In public ser

The Government has refused to be
moved by the touching spectacle of a
man's neck in the embrace of the colls of
a gun, and has rejected the claim on the
ground that the injury complained of. In
view of the explanation of Ha occurrence.
Is not a ratable disability. This ruling
suggests that if the Injury to the eyes
accrued from the shock of the impact of
the shell with the sun the veteran's
nerves also would have been affected,
and there is no showing that tho nerves

One of the most remarkable stortes ever
told by a veteran as a basis for pension
emolument is set forth in a claim from a
man in Ohio. The claimant waa very anx
ious to get his money and was particular
to go into detail as to the way in which
he became entitled to a pldee on the na
tion's pay roll. He alleges that during a
battle the fragment of a shell struck his
gun while It was at right shoulder and
bent the barrel of the gun about hl3 neck
In an , uncomfortable and embarrassing
fashion. He himself escaped the shell,
but the barrel refused to be disentangled.
The claimant contended under oath that
the barrel was so hopelessly bent around
his neck that it took three men to un
wind it. He alleges that by reason of this
peculiar, freakish and unprecedented ac
tion of the gun barrel his eyes were bad
ly Injured, and he therefore claims pen
sion. "

BADGE FOE STEWAET.
The administration by the Board of Pensions
of the pension laws, that for so many years
had proven to vexatious and unsatisfactory,
seems to have been adjusted to a degree of
satisfaction. I believe the present Commis
sioner is earnestly endeavoring to discharge
the duties of his high and Important offlce
honestly, liberally and Justly, and yet he Is
not able to satisfy the many who feel and
assert that the Government has not dealt
and is not . dealing Justly with them- The
complaints are not so numerous or so vigorous
as in the recent past, and yet they are suffi
cient to warrant our earnest and careful atten
tion and consideration. Complaint will never
entirely cease, nor will cases of Injustice be
entirely eliminated from the administration
of each a great trust, but by an honest, fair
and liberal administration of the laws, we
may reach the minimum of complaint and of
injustice. Is not the time at hand when wis
dom and justice both warrant such an adjust
ment of the pension laws as will meet the con
dition that exists by providing for â¢ a fixed
amount of pension per month? I believe It
would be wise to appoint a committee whose
duty would be to frame a proper bill and pre
sent the same to Congress, providing for a
pension of not less than $12 per month for all
honorably dUcharged soldiers. sailors or
marines who may choose to apply.

and glorious results? Never was a war so

most enjoyable events of my life. There is no

to be with you on this occasion. I thank you
for the compliment of this Invitation to be

hero . and a distinguished general, as your
commander for the ensuing year.
I have one request to make, and that is. bÂ»
tciTit you leave here you have your baggage
checked for Boston for the next encampment.
I can assure you, as a Boston boy, that you
will receive a most cordial welcome in the
grand old Bay State, the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts; and what is more, that you will
have an opportunity of meeting in the cradle
of liberty. It has been said that the hand
that rocks the cradle rules the world. My
comrades, you have moved the world, and no
more fitting place could be found for your next
gathering than in the cradle of liberty. It is
also certain that no more fitting place could
have been found for this celebration than here
on the shores of the Pacific, in this metropolis,
by the Golden Gate of California. It has given
an opportunity tr> you, as you come from the
East and the West, from the palms of the
South, and the forests of the North, to realize
what you fought for, "and what your comrades
died for. ! It is an inspiration to the people
o( this* country, to see their heroes moving fronT
every quarter of this country to this grand
reunion, and it has been an inspiration, a rev

that this Is our country, saved by your valor,
fortitude and sacrifices. You have seen the
grand old flag under which you marched and

and over millions of happy homes. The cause
was certainly one of the grandest In which
any warriors could be engaged.

A quartet of pretty, willow-patterned
Chinese children from the Methodist Mis

amazed the visitor* from the East. A
number of Chinese maidens from the
Methodist Mission and a few from the
Presbyterian Mission kindly and grace
fully handed round to the 2000 guests
pretty little trays with tiny cups of re
freshing tea. Every one agreed that the
reception was as much of a success as It
v.-as novel.
It was a great throng of fashionables
that attended the reception. There were
army men and newspaper men, women of
national distinction, and artists, travelers
and authors.

patriotic of the nation's music.
Between numbers beautiful and heart
ful melodies, sung in the long past by sol
diers on the battle field, were exquisitely
rendered by the Press Club Quartet, and
downstairs, in the handsome dining-room
of the mansion, were seated Chinese mu
sicians, who played their quaint and sur
prisingly melody-touched compositions
with a precision and acknowledgment of
tempo that quite surprised the vast and
interested assemblage.
Members of the pr^ss. weldom connect

words at his command adequate to ex
press his appreciation for California's re
ception and loyalty to those who were
taking part in the encampment.
To the Ladles of the Grand Army of the
Republic he brought words of commenda
tion, coupled with the heartfelt gratitude
of the organisation of which he is com
mander In chief.
General Shafter received an ovation
when he arose to address the assemblage,
as did also E. J. Butler, past department
commander.
The Ladles of the G. A. U. arranged a
programme of music and patriotic recita
tions and supplied a great table with Cal
ifornia delicacies, and did so many kindly
things that General Stewart said he Could
never forget San Franci3co's generosity.
The general was introduced by Mrs. M.
Anna Hall, national president of the La
dies of the Grand Army, in a speech full
of sentiment and patriotism.
General Stewart, earnest, powerful of
voice and every inch the soldier, recount
ed the valor, the doughty deeds and the
determination of the men who went to the
front under the folds of Old Glory.
-While admitting the horrors of the bat
tle field, the pafn consequent on war, the
intense suffering of those left behind to
mourn the loss of father, brother or son,
he told his hearers of the progress that
has sprung from battle, the advancement
of peoples and the stability of nations fol

. The. chief defect of the box kite, of
which Dr. Langley's aerodrome Is an elab

does with the square, so that the larger
the kite the less It will lift in proportion.
Professor Graham Bell's kites are â¢* equal
sided triangles, so that they need no brac

increased at a greater rate than the In

and who were members of his staff dur
ing the Civil War.
General Miles was surrounded by hun
dreds of his friends In the Palace Hotel
yesterday when It became known that he
was about to return to the East.
The veteran soldier was evidently well
pleased with the many expressions of
good will tendered him and he was visibly
affected when some of the old soldier*
brought him some flowers as -a token of
tbelr regard.
Previous to leaving the city General
Miles was seen by a Call reporter and In
reply to questions he said:
"I am going to Wier, N. H.. to attenS
the convention of the Grand Army State
department. I promised the old soldiers
there that I would attend the meeting
and that Is why I am forced to leave San
Francisco at this time. I cannot express
myself as to the cordiality extended me
in San Francisco in the past few days and
I shall never forget this visit. As to th-j
reports that I am likely to be selected
as a candidate for the honor of Governor
of Massachusetts. I must positively de
cline to discuss politics.
"Many statements have been credited
to me in the past two weeks, but I desire
to say at this time that I have not dis
cussed polltlca, on my trip to California
and, as you know, I have declined to be
drawn into any political discussion during
my visit to this city."
The departure of General Miles wai

being at the ferry to wish the- distinguish
ed soldier a safe journey to the Atlantic

1 The* war lords of France tried a peculiar experiment
the other day when they ordered that live shells be
fired at the turret of a French man-of-war. The bat

Missouri seems determined to keep in the world's
eye at least until the opening of the great St. Louis
Exposition. She is rounding up her boodlers in
every part of the State and meting out to them the
punishment they deserve. The administration of
implacable, uncompromising justice for big and little
alike is perhaps the most worthy advertisement the
State can receive.
While a Wyoming convict was attempting to escape
the other day he was killed by a turnkey. The fact is
interesting simply to illustrate that under practically
all conditions California stands against the world
as a preferred place of habitation for persons of all
classes. We have no such bloodthirsty turnkeys in
California, as our Folsom episode proves.
Oregon has settled for itself a problem that inter

Judge has decided that $22,500 is at least more than
enough to pay for a woman's broken heart and femi

ises. While it is, of course, consoling to know what
the maximum of damages can be in these affairs, the
courts of the Webfoot State must set their wheels in
motion and tell us what is the minimum.-
Â¦ There has just been placed on exhibition
in the, Umlauff Museum at Hamburg the
biggest known specimen of gorilla. It was
shot in the Cameroon territory In West
Africa. After much difficulty it was re
moved to Hamburg, stuffed, mounted and
placed on exhibition. It measured 6 feet
10% inches from the crown of the head
to tho middle toe, and across from middle
finger to middle finger 9 feet 3% inches. It
was largely a matter of chance that the
commercial traveler, Herr Paschen of
Schwerin, shot this gigantic gorilla.
When the natives came to the agency
at Cameroon with stories of the "big
monkey" Herr Paschen did not take much
stock in their yarns, but when the native
troops started out on a hunt for the
gorilla the German traveler took his car
bine and went along. After some hours'
travel they came to the patch of bush
where the gorilla was supposed to be hid
ing. The "natives surrounded the bush,
and suddenly the beast's head appeared.
Herr Paschen made a path through the
bush with his bush knife and when with
in range took aim and fired.
It was plucky shot, for the beast at
once fell with a bullet through hla head.
He fell with a crash and was almost In
stantly dead. It was not an easy matter
to remove the gorilla to the coast, thence
to Hamburg, bu| there it is now, almost
lifelike in appearance, so carefully was
the mounting and stuffing done. Along
side is the gigantic skeleton. Since the
gorilla 1 was -placed . on exhibition the
crowds at the museum have been enor
mous, and the comments upon its marked
resemblance to the human species have
been general.â Chicago Record-Herald.

Whether or not it would be advisable to introduce a
course of postal service instruction into the public
schools is for public school teachers to decide. The
schools are pretty heavily overloaded with studies as
it is. We can hardly hope to teach a child everything
at once and make him a master of all the intricacies
of government, science, industry and art while he is
struggling with, the rules of reading, writing and
arithmetic. Still, it might be possible to give the
youth T)f the lanu a sufficient amount of knowledge
to enable them to understand the importance of ad
dressing a letter legibly and correctfy. If that were
AT the recent convention of the National Associ
ation of Postmasters at Boston there were dis
' cussed quite a number of propositions for the
improvement of the service and it is probable that
most of them will be submitted to Congress for adop
tion. Of course, the members of the association know
the needs of the service better than any outsider, and
as a consequence the recommendations of the con
vention ought to have great weight in determining
the course of postal legislation in the immediate fu
ture.
Amortg the more important improvements sug
gested by the convention are the adoption of a simple
form for sending small remittances through the mails,
so as to avoid the indosure of postage stamps; more
rapid transit in large cities between the main office
and the sub-stations and the railway depots, and in
creased facilities for the special delivery service.
One of the salient features of the convention was a
discussion of the need of educating the public with
respect to postal matters. There is no branch of the
Government that is closer to the people or is so much
in use by the great masses ai is the postal service, and
as a consequence it is important that well-nigh every
one should know how to make right use of it: Post
master Tucker of Toledo recommended that the in
struction begin in the public schools and that all chil
dren be taught how to address a letter properly, how
to get a postal order and how to get a letter for
warded by special delivery. By way of making a
beginning in the work of general education on the
subject the secretary of the convention was ordered to
prepare suitable explanations of the various services of
the office so that the public can learn how to avail
themselves of them without permitting errors that
puzzle the officials and sometimes render it impossi
ble for a letter to be carried to the person for whom
it was intended.
In speaking of the recent work* of the
Anglia in laying the Commercial Pacific
Cable the Honolulu correspondent .of the
New York Herald says: "In the actual
work of laying the final section of cable
the Anglia had a very remarkable trip.
She started soon after noon on June 2S to
pay out the section from Midway to Hon
olulu, and came right along without the
slightest hitch, or delay, taking the
courses eurveyed by the Hero several
years ago. The deep sea cable ended
about ten miles south of the island of
Oahu, about eighteen miles from the place
where the; shore end was landed. The
Anglia laid exactly 1315 knots of cable
from Midway to this point, and with the
additional eighteen miles of shdre end the
actual amount of cable laid Is 1333 knots.
There was about 8 per* cent of slackage.
The cable force was very proud of the
making of a new record for- continuous
use of the wire log, which registers the
distance traveled. This log Is on reels of
140 knots each, which have to be renewed
as fast as they are run off. Heretofore the
transfer of the reels has necessitated ves
sels slacking. The greatest run ever made
before without a stop was 840 knots. The
Anglia ran the entire distance of 1221 miles
without a single break : :or stoppage or
Flacking of speed. The greatest depth
encountered on the trip from Midway was
about 2700 fathoms."
With regard to trolley extension In
Paris it is stated that the controversy
over the matter has brought out many
harsh criticisms about the way the au
thorities are gradually but surely "uglify
ing" la vtlle lumlere. One interview In
the Figaro which has attracted consider
able attention is with Victor Blnet, the
well-known decorator. He asks what is
the use of bothering with overhead wires
âfor . trolleys must be endured whether
they are ugly or notâ when so many other
misdeeds, against art are being commit
ted. The so-called new art has so stulti
fied the public that no trace of taste re
mains in France. These new art people
have been working for years to make
Paris ugly. They were allowed to devas
tate the Esplanade des Invalides and the
Champs Elyseea. The new monuments
and ornaments In the squares and parks
are ridiculousâ gingerbread and cardboard
monstrosities altogether devoid of decora
tive effect. The new houses are hideous
with their absurdly unornamental fa
cades, 'which will harmonize well with the
trolley wires, the gibbets stuck all over
the city and the yellow asparagus stalks
fixed up over the entrances to the stations
of the underground railway, called for
brevity the "Metro." "Let us pray," says
M. Blnet, "for power to stand all this
mercantilism. Americanism and utter
ugliness." But why "Americanism"? New
art Is decidedly a European production,
French or German, perhaps both.

COMMENTING upon action taken by the
Legislature of Georgia to mitigate to some
extent of the evils of the lease system of
working convicts, The Call stated yesterday that un
der the new law all convicts sentenced to confine
ment and work for five years or more are to be em
ployed on public roads instead of being leased to
private parties. It appears that the dispatch on
which that statement was based was erroneous. ,A
copy of the Atlanta Constitution now at hand states
that it is the short term and not the long term con
victs who are to be employed in public work. The
long termers are still to be subject to the leasing sys
tem, while the lesser sentence men will have the ben
efit of serving time in their own localities and under
public supervision, where they will be less liable to
brutal treatment.
Short as is this step in the direction of a correct
prison system, it is still a movement toward reform
and will induce the taking of further steps later on.
The Constitution announces that already several
counties in the State have made application for all
the short term convicts from their courts and will at
once put them to work on the public roads. It
goes on to say: "Of the 2200 convicts, in round
numbers, one-third, or fully 750 of them, are under
sentences of less than five years. This is enough to
enable half the counties in the State to have profit
able road-working gangs, and the results would be
speedily manifest in every county where they
be employed."
That, it seems, is the best Georgia can do at pres
ent. In the end, however, chain gangs working on
public roads will become as offensive to public sen
timent as the outrages that have just stirred popular
indignation against the lease system. The road of
prison reform is a long one, and with the exception
of Mississippi the progress of the Southern States
is' slow. However, the movement has begun. The
flogging of a woman on a convict farm has set the
better elements of the people of Georgia to thinking
on the subject, and that in itself is a gain of great
importance, for when people begin to think it will
riot be long before they begin to reform.

Shakespeare's Indebtedness to the Bible
has been made the subject of an exhaus
tive Inquiry by William Burgess. The
Â»uthor informs us that when he began
his studies he had no Idea of publication,
but was led solely by personal interest^
as the result of certain utterances con 2
cernlng the "so-called absencft of religion
in Shakespeare." The evidence against
this assumption, the author found, is so
abundant and conclusive that it "amounts
to a revelation." Consequently we have
"The Bible In Shakespeare," a bulky vol
ume, which has just been published.
At the outset Mr. Burgess admits that
Shakespeare is still "the poet of secular
humanity." His contention Is that the
poet drew largely from the Bible for his
loftiest thoughts and noblest Inspirations;
that he employed "Scripture teachings,
facts, poetry, philosophy and language in
his writings," and that he was a sincere
believer and accepted the orthodox views
current In his day.
That some of these contentions are open
to question is fairly obvious, but that
Shakespeare was familiar with the Scrip
tures and, consciously or unconsciously,
made abundant* use of his knowledge Is
Indisputable. For, as Mr. Burgess points
out, in Shakespeare's time, the. Bible was
common property. The time had gone by
when to read it was heresy. It was not
only no longer a forbidden book, but al
most the only book within reach of the
common people. Mr. Burgess would go
further and hold that "if Shakespeare
had the advantage of any book in his
early home, that book was probably the
Bible. Indeed," he maintains, "it is prob
able that no other books were available
to him during his early dayB, except, per
haps, Plutarch and such glimpses of his
tory and the classics as he could obtain
in his lessons In school."
Again, we are reminded that the King
James version of tho Bible took shape
between 1604 and 1611. and that these
years, together with the five following,
were the greatest of Shakespeare's life.
That he should not, under such circum
stances, have become saturated with the
thought and language of the Bible our
author considers inconceivable. Still, lit
tle was quoted verbatim. But the "use
of biblical characters, facts, figures, doc
trines and laws in the author's (Shake
speare's) own language Is so common as
to constitute one of tho most remarkable
of the many marvels of Shakespeare."
So much for the author's general con
tentions. For the rest â and this doubtless
constitutes the valuable part of the book
âhe has gdhe laboriously through the
plays and given us a chapter of refer
ences to lines in which the word God ap
pears, another in which biblical charac
ters are, mentioned and several devoted
to Scriptural and Shakespearian parallels.
On the whole, it is a curious and, inter
esting- book.
Instead of permitting the construction of more and
longer and more dangerous tunnels the overland
roads should be compelled to reconstruct the tun
nels in which people have already been killed by lack
of ventilation. They should be made higher and
pierced by frequent ventilating shafts, better lighted
by electricity and the air changed by a forced draft,
actuated by duplicate machinery, so as to make sure
file constancy of such means for purifying the air.
The dangers and risks of travel are already suffi
ciently numerous without adding to them the horror
of long and far underground tunnels.
Short tunnels are endured because they are self
ventiiating and are quickly passed. But tunnels more
than a. mile long are proved to be highly dangerous,
by the death of two engine crews in the long tunnel
in the Cascades on the Northern Pacific and of the
linemen in the San Fernando tunnel on the Southern
Pacific. In each case the men died because the air
in the tunnel was vitiated by the sulphurous smoke of
the passing engines. These accidents made it plain
that if a derailment occur in those tunnels, or a pas
senger train is slopped by any accident, the passen
gers would be killed by asphyxiation. While it is la
mentable that such notice should be needed, it is
still true that the subway deaths and horrors in Ore
gon, California and Paris have called attention to the
impolicy of railroads in this country attempting to
get easier grades by making long tunnels.
The people would rather pay the slight additional
cost of a haul on a stiff grade than be subjected to
the risk of an awful death, in the dark, far under
ground. Californians are interested in it vitally. No
railroad can get out of this State or enter it without
overcoming the mountain range. That this can be
done with a surface track and by the use of short
tunnels is shown by experience. True, the grades
are heavy, but full trains climb them.
The present owners of the Southern Pacific are
said to be planning a tunnel under the Sierra Ne
vada Range that is to be eight miles long. Such
a tunnel should not be built. Its construction may
appeal to the professional pride of engineers and even
to the constructive ambition of capitalists, but the
public should be everywhere notified of the dangers
of its use, and every means should be taken, by the
press and by societies for the public safety, to induce
travelers not to patronize the line that uses it. To
the other risks of its use earthquakes are added,
which by shattering its arch may at any moment
hopelessly imprison or crush trains. Even if it were
not dangerous to a degree warranting Jegal injunc
tion of its construction, the same as any work that
is dangerous to human life may be enjoined, its use
cancels the traveler's view of our rare and inspiring
mountain scenery-
THE horror on the subway railroad in Paris
has added to the aversion of the people to
tunnels and subway roads. Subterranean
routes are never provided with means to be used
promptly and efficiently in case of fire or other ac
cident. Ventilation is either entirely lacking, or, as
in the case of the Alps tunnels between France and
Italy, it depends on machinery, so that travelers are
taking the same risk as a diver who depends on the
air pump to keep him alive and dies instantly if it fail
one stroke.

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
A CHANCE TO SMILE.
FOR the first time in the history of San Quen
tin prison convicts as a body have in due
form given an expression of regret at the depar
ture from office of a Warden of the institution. The
incident is noteworthjvfor there is in it something
of appropriateness and something of incongruity that
renders it both instructive and amusing.
The incongruity is apparent on the face of it. It
is an old' saying that "No rogue e'er felt the halter
draw with good opinion of the law," and it is a plain
inference that had the convicts been restrained in
theic vicious tendencies by the Warden they would
not have entertained, a good opinion of him. It
appears they have not looked upon him as an officer
of the law, but as a friend, and more or less one of
their own kind. This incongruity raises a smile, and
were there nothing back of it the incident would
pass as one of the amusing things of life having no
special significance. . . . .
It happens, however, that there is a certain appro
priateness in the expression of friendship on the part
of the convicts for the Warden. His relations to
some of them at least have been very close and of
a familiar nature. It is well known that during his
administration the rules of the prison hav^becn vio
lated, its records distorted and falsified, illegal work
has been done and rank forgeries committed. AH
those things have been proven in court. Warden
Aguirre and some of his outside friends, have been
the beneficiaries of the offenses, and it is but rea
sonable to suppose that 1 he has permitted some of
the convicts also to profit by them. Such being the
case, the resolution of regret at his departure is ap
propriate, and most certainly ought not to raise a
laugh.
Having received the expressions of regret, it is now
in order for the retiring Warden to assure the con-'
victs that, he values their esteem above that of any
one else in the State, and to set forth his obligations
to those^of them to whom he is specially indebted for
assistance in falsifying the records. A tribute to the
friendship of the men who aided him in violating the
rules of the prison and breaking the laws of the
State would be a proper response to the friendly
manifestations of the entire body of convicts. Such
declarations on his part would fitly round out the
incident and make it a perfect thing of the kind, and
he could then close the affair by the customary for
mula of assurance that the commendation of the in
mates of San Quentin will ever remain a precious
memjory and the incident be regarded as the proud
est moment of his life.

All of these institutions are in receipt
continually of applications for children,
but it has been difficult heretofore to get
satisfactory Information regarding the
character of the applicants.
It is frequently the case that persons
residing in remote sections of the State
send requests that they be given an or
phan for adoption, and sometimes inves
tigation has shown that the applicants
are unable to provide properly for the
little ones. NoW\an agency has been es
tablished at 606 Montgomery street and
the work formerly handled by the thir
teen institutions separately will be con
ducted through one office.
Mrs. Isabel H. Raymond, at present
probation officer of the San Francisco Ju
venile Court, has been selected as the
agent. She will travel through the State
Investigating applications and finding
homes for orphans. In this manner the
children will be well provided for and the
congestion in the local institutions will be
relieved. She will leave for the southern
part of the State September 1 to begin
her labors in the new field.
H. "W. Lewis has been chosen president
of the new organization, which has been
named the Children's Agency of San
Francisco and Vicinity, and Miss Cathe
rine C. Felton has been chosen secretary,
i . ,
Thirteen of the State's leading charita
ble associations and orphan asylums bave
effected an organization for the purpose
of finding homes for children who have
become public charges. All of the iocal
charitable institutions are crowded to the
limit with homeless boys and girls, and
with the rapid increase of population In
San Francisco the problem has" become
steadily more difficult of solution. .
Fox contemplates establishing roadside
coffee clubs. Attractive places with gar
dens will be fitted up near the ordinary
roadhouses and saloons. Light meals and
all temperance drinks will be served. He
believes that people will patronize the
coffee clubs instead of saloons and that
In time the roadside saloon will disappear.
The experiment of establishing coffee
clubs along the road will be tried first in
Santa Clara County.
Ernest Fox of this city has formed the
clubs. in this State and elsewhere. They
are a success and have proved profitable.
Fox now proposes to form a State asso
ciation, and the articles of incorporation
have been prepared. San Jose Is to be
the headquarters of the association.
Fox, whose movement has the sanction
of the churches, will raise "160,000 to erect
a headquarters building In this city. An
attempt will also be made to have the
clubs in Santa. Clara. Petaluma and San
Diego and those about to be organized
erect their own buildings. The profits of
these clubs will go Into the State asso
ciation.
SAN JOSE, Augr. 20.â The coffee clubs
In San Jose, Petaluma, Santa Clara and
San Diego are to be incorporated into a
State association. Other clubs are being
formed and they will be included in the
organization. The aim of the coffee clubs
is to furnish places of entertainment for
young men and boya.^o keep them from
visiting saloons. Coffle. light meals, ice
cream and soft drinks are sold. Reading
rooms are conducted In connection with
the places. San Jose . has three of the
clubsâ one for men, one for boys and an
other for women.

The bill further asks that Addlcks be
ordered to deliver to the receiver the can
cellation certificates for the 1,500.000 shares
of stock, and that an accounting be made
of the damages and loss sustained by the
Bay State Gas Company of Delaware in
consequence of the alleged fraudulent and
unlawful is3ue of stock, and that the de
fendants be ordered to pay an amount
equivalent to the alleged damage aad
loss. The defendants are required to ap
pear and make answer on the first Mon
day, of November.
The stock is alleged to have been trans
ferred on July 3. 1902. The bill alleged
that the stock was not Issued direct to
Addlcks, but to another man. presumably
on the order of Addicks. The allegation
is made that the stock was issued to Ed
win M. Poul. a New York broker, who
is alleged to have been in the employ of
Addicks to sell the stock. It is further
set forth that of the $75,000,000 of stock
Addlcks is believed to still control a largÂ«
portion.
The bill charges the defendants as di
rectors, except Addlcks. with entering
into an unlawful combination to- issue to
Addicks l.uOO.000 shares of stock of the
Bay StxAe Gas Company without consid

WILMINGTON. Del.. Aug. 2O.-In the
United States Circuit Court to-day George
Wharton Pepper of Philadelphia, recelvf-r
of the Bay State Gas Company of Dela
ware, filed a bill of complaint against J.
Edward Addlcks, United States Senator
J Frank Allee and others, alleging fraud
in connection with a transaction Involv
ing the stock of the company, said to be
valued at '$75,000,000.
There is something deeply significant in the energy
with which Russia is displaying her avenging wrath
toward Turkey. The spirit with which nations are
quick or slow to enter a quarrel depends altogether
upon the character 1 of the other fellow. Japan has
been saucy to the bear for many months, but the un
ruffled dignity of diplomatic deceit has not been and
probably will not be disturbed between them.
AS men are constituted it is to be expected that
all organizations will be used for selfish and
sometimes for corrupt purposes'. \It' is not
surprising that the labor unions have proved no ex
ception to the rule. Indeed, they offer a peculiarly
inviting field for the play of selfish motives. They are
voluntary organizations, not incorporated .and with
no legal responsibility. They can neither sue nor be
sued, and so have been the prey of men who were
sufficiently ingenious and* unscrupulous to see and
use their opportunity.
The revelations in New York have brought the
courts into action. Already one walking delegate is
in stripes in Sing Sing for "^fining" an employer
$io f ooo and pocketing the money, which was really
his price, as a bribe, for ordering off a strike which
he had ordered on to give him the chance to extort
the money. This case, when on trial, brought out
very startling revelations. It was disclosed that the
money extorted in that way from employers
amounted to millions, and not a dollar of it was
traceable to the union treasuries. Building and
other contractors habitually added to the prices of
their work a sum sufficient to pay these bribes,
which were the price of the walking delegate's per
mission to go oi. with their contracts. The union
workmen must quit when ordered, under penalty of
a fine, which they must pay for permission to work
at all. So the system meant a higher price paid for
work by the public, and was maintained by threaten
ing the laborer with starvation unless he made him
self the patient instrument of extortion for the bene
fit of the walking delegate, who ruled him with a rod
of iron.
Another walking delegate is now on trial in New
York. He was the delegate of the Housesmiths* and
Bridgemen's Union. The testimony shows that he
extorted enormous sums and pocketed them as the
price of his permission for employers tto go on with
their work. The respectable firm of Tiffany's tells
a typical story of this walking delegate's methods.
The firm started about a year ago in the heavy
metal trade in house fittings. Their plant was
unionized and an agreement signed to that effect,
Last December a strike was ordered. Upon in
quiry of their workmen none of them knew why the
strike was ordered. There was no issue of hours
or wages. No non-union men had been employed,
and the workmen admitted that the firm had kept
rts union agreement in every particular.
The firm sent a clerk to the walking delegate to
find out what was the matter.. That higl\ official
said to the clerk: "You tell Tiffany he can go to
hell. I'm not doing business with any peanuts. If
they send some responsible person here I'll do busi
ness." The firm obeyed the great man and sent the
superintendent, who was told that the firm was fined
$500. Asked what the fine was for he said, "It's just
your initiation fee." Asked if the money went to the
union, he answered: "The union be . It goes to
me/' He then said that he tied up the Hecla Iron
Works for eighteen months, and would do the same
with Tiffany. He refused to take a check, and de
manded cash. When asked why the workmen them
selves knew of no reason for striking, he said: "I
muzzle 'cm. Any man that talked would be fined
$50, lose his job and never get another as long as
I'm in New York." The money was paid and the
strike was ordered off, though the delegate said he
was sorry he did not make the fine $1000. It is in
evidence that the HÂ«cla Iron Works, after losing
eighteen months' work, paid the same man $10,000
and were permitted to resume business.
The startling part of this remarkable case is that
after all this exposure the union re-elected this same
man walking delegate.
Perhaps these experiences will do something to
remove the objections of the unions. to incorpora
tion, which will make their walking delegates legally
responsible and remove the muzzle from the members
themselves. .

name entered on the detlnuÂ« book at the City

Special Dispatch to The Call
PORT TOWN8END, .Wash., Aug. 20.â
That Private John Crosso, Seventy-first
Company, Coast Artillery, was not hanged
by lynchers Is entirely due to the timely
appearance of fellow-soldiers when the
men engaged In searching for the assail
ant of Mrs. Jackson found him disguised
and hiding on Whidby Island, several
miles from Fort Casey. Knowing; the
sentiment prevailing among the farmers,
Sheriff Comstock lost no time in soliciting
the aid of the soldiers, and was enabled to
land Crosso safely In Fort Casey guard
house, where he will b6 kept until the
case is disposed of, the calaboose at
Coupeville, the county seat, being an. old
structure, from which it would be easy to
escape or for a mob to, take a prisoner. ,
Croeso has been all but positively iden
fled as the man who committed the brutal
assault upon Mrs. Jackson, the wife of a
farmer living near the Government re
serve, on Wednesday morning. His fran
tic efforts to secrete himself after having
effected a disguise, and the fact that he
was the only one absent -from roll call
point to Crosso as the guilty party. Ex
citement ran hieh on the island . for a
time, but the promptness with which the
arrest was effected has partly allayed the
anger of the farmers, who are now con
tent to allow the law to take its course.

of the hits came when they were needed

Henry Kxug made the only circus catch
of the game in the seventh inning, and it
shut off a run. Francis had singled and
there were two out. Hollingsworth hit
the ball on a direct line to center field

It Is evident he has not reached the

Eight of these harness horses have done
2:02 or better. ; A dozen trotters on the

attributed partly to the efforts of the
wealthy amateur relnsmen, such as C.

Interest created by the remarkable per
formances of Lou Dillon, the California

horse world, with his pacing record of
1:59. This clips one quarter of a second
from the world's record, which was held
by Star Pointer for six years. The new
harness king changed owners last year
for a consideration of $00,000.
Dan Patch's great performance on
Wednesday rights an injustice done him
by the racing authorities. Some time
since he tied Star Pointer's record of
1:59*4. but under a technicality his name
was not bracketed vrith that of the other

announced as an attempt to beat the rec
ord. As he only tied It the figure's were

the officials was roundly criticized.

The Leeb laboratory is the gift of Ru

The many friends of Murray Laidlaw,
ex-LJbrary Trustee and candidate for the
office of Cltjr Treasurer at the last elec
tion, will be much surprised to learn
that he was very Quietly married last
night to Mrs. Carrie Cleveland-Akerley,
daughter of L. C. ClevelAid of 11SS East
Nineteenth street. East Oakland. The
ceremony was performed at 8 o'clock at
the home of Rev. Thomas Baldwin, for
merly pastor of the First Baptist Church
of Alameda, who now resides In East
Oakland.
â¢ No one except the members of the two
families was Informed when or where the
wedding was to take place, and after the
ceremony the newly married pair moved
Into their new home at 1173 East Twenty
first street, which had been furnished In
.-anticipation of the event.
Murray Laidlaw is a member of an old
and well known Oakland family. His
brother, Frank Laidlaw. resides at 730

dence of the groom up to the time of his
marriage. The third Drother. the late

than spores. If, on the other hand, living
germs are as old as cosmic matter the trans
portation of germs from star to star is only
Imaginable If the germs were extremely small
and consequently simple in structure. In either
case It Is necessary to assume that the present
fauna and flora of the earth must have devel
oped from structures of no higher degree of dif
ferentiattlon than, for example, spores.
Before closing, allow me to make one addi
tional remark. It is quite common to find that
even scientists are Inclined to assume that tha
restrictions or limitations to research In bi
ology are greater than, or of a different order
from, those in the field, df physics or chemistry.
This Is not true as long as we treat biological
problems* In the same unbiased and unpreju
diced way In which we deal with the problems
of physics and chemistry. The alchemists tried
to solve the problem of perpetual motion and
of making gold. No one would say. however,
that the physicist or chemist Is limited In hta
search for truth because perpetual motion ta
Impossible and the chemical elements are con
stant. On the contrary. It Is fully recognized
that the discovery of such constants as thÂ»
quantity of energy of a system or the chemical
elements were the most fertile discoveries ever,
made, and. In fact, are among the pillars oa
which not only modern phystcs. chemistry and
biology, but. Indirectly, our whole modern civ
ilization, rests. Why should we> change our
attltudo when we leave the field of biology,
and why should we consider It a restriction or
limitation of knowledge If It should turn outâ
which Is far from certain, however â that it Is
no more Impossible to transform dead matter
Into living matter than to transform copper
Into gold?

Enters the List of

laws of these sciences. In exactly the Â«amÂ«
way all chemical phenomena are subject to
the laws of mathematics and of pi ysics, ana
Indeed sn such a way that no chemical law
will, if It Is correct/contradict ar.y law of
physics or of mathematics. But the laws of
mathematics and of physics do not by any
means exhaust all that can be tald about
chemical phenomena, and the qualitative dif
ferences of substances, which form the sub
ject matter of chemistry, cannot be sufficiently
nor completely worked out by the Implement*
of those sciences. The cause lies In the fact
that In chemistry we have to do with a richer
manlfoldness than In the preceding sciences.
Whether we charge a sphere of gold or an
equally large sphere of carbon to one hundred
volts makes no difference so lonÂ« as we are
considering only the physical. 1. e., here- the
electrical phenomenon. But whethar we burn
a sphere of sulphur or an equally large spneTe
of carbon, makes, chemically considered an
Irreconcilable difference. Thus also tne chem
ical composition of a living man Is not dif
ferent from that of a dead one, while, bio
logically considered, the difference is a great
one, since the first can nourish Itself and
propagate Its kind, while the second cannot.
Here you may perhaps find some objections,
but I scarcely believe that you will be able
to change matters much. At the moat It might
be necessary to our definition of life to be
somewhat more exact.
From what has been said there fellows di
rectly the answer to the much discussed ques
tion as to whether the laws of chemistry and
physics are sufficient to explain all biological
phenomena. In one sense the answer must
be yes. In another sense no. ~XÂ°% In so far
as all biological phenomena lie within the
realm at possibilities given by those sciences.
No in so far as within this realm undoubtedly
a greater manifoldnesg will be given than can
be completely represented by physics and
chemistry.
Perhaps it will make matters clearer If we
look Into the analogous relationship that ex
ists between mathematics and physics. Most
certainly all physical phenomena are to be
classified under the concept of quantity, and
to this extent physics may be considered as
a part of mathematics. But Just aÂ» certainly
classification Is to that extent arbitrary, that
one can introduce numerous intermediate steps
between those already given, and by this means
take account of smaller differences. Thus
sociology and Anthropology majt be Introduced
between biology and psychology, while physical
chemistry would He between physics and chem
istry. But I do not need to go further Into
this matter. Of greater Importance, perhaps,
would be the Introduction between mathematics
and geometry, tl the science of chronology,
or the laws of time (not to be confounded
with historical, geological â¢ or astionomical
time), still, these considerations would carry
us too far.

sion of the ttruggle of which these days are
full. Everywhere the individual sciences are
seeking to find their rolnts of contact with one
nnother; everywhere the Investigator examines
his own special results, to see what bearing
they muy have on the most general questions:
In short, all sciences are beginning to phil
osophize. Nowhere Is the ftruggle toward
fundamental explanation so great as In biology.
A glance Into biological literature shows us at
once with what a vast deal of earnestness and
energy tho biologists are struggling to throw
light upon thefundamentatl principles of their
science. â¢ I
When one flUempts a eeneral classification
of the sciences one cornea soon to the I result
that they do' not exist alonuslde cf one an
'otlwr. but rather that they include one an
other, and in a remarkably reciprocal manner,
which allows of a somewhat Imperfect geo
metrical representation^ Human experience Is
the direct object of all sciences. Every experi
ence Is composed of an unlimited number of
components; of these components only a few
arc taken Into consideration, according to the
specific purpose; all others are left out of con
sideration. Thus a given science includes -the
more experiences the smaller the number of
components considered: and It includes con
versely the more components the narrower the
choice of experiences. Thus that science which,
from the one point of view Is the broadest,
is from the other point of view the narrowest,
and conversely. In order to give you at least
an approximate conception of these relations
I wish to call your attention to this sketch. In
which the number of experiences Is represented
horizontally and the number ' ot components
vertically. Thus you can see that the theory
of .manifolds Is the most inclusive and nar
rowest'of sciences, because It Includes all ex
periences but considers these experiences from
only one side, namely, that each Is a dlstin-
Kulshpble object: on the other hand, psychology
is the narrowest and most Inclusive Science,
because It deals only with phenomena which
have to uo with the human brain (or U one
prefers, the human soul), but takes into con
slderat on all possible components.
Thus If we start with the theory of man
ifolds, arranging â¢ the sciences In a regular
series we see that each science in the series
Involves the preceding. . but reaches - beyond
this In - that it deals with new components
with which the preceding science had nothing
to do Ils scope Is thereby male narrower
a B it has to do only with experiences which
possess the new components. Thus mathe
matics has to do with the theory of manifolds,
but only with such manifolds as possess quan
tity Geometry has to do with manifolds, but
only with such as . possess f the properties of
space. Physics treats of special objects, ; but
only in so far as the different forms of energy
are active upon them, while chemistry has to
do with physical objects, Â¦ which ire distin
guished from one another by qualitative dif
ferences, apart from those due to , the pres
ence of any other forms of energy. In this
system biology Is that ? science whl:h has to
do ' with such chemical .objects as show a
stationary - condition of .- energy,' that Is, * such
as show, the phenomena of ' nourishment -and
of propagation.' Psychology, finally, has' to
do with life processes, only In so far as they
exhibit spiritual functions, from which it is
easy to see that the . Intellectual ' processes * of
manktnd -are almost: the only things concern-
Ing Â¦: which â¢ we possess Â¦Â¦â¢ moderately *, certain
knowledge. \. : '
' It ' is ' probably- needless to say that . this
One of the most influential components of
these movements is at the present time espe
cially easy of recognition. We have Just passed
through , a" period of specialization, Â¦ in which
all science has been most strictly divided into
Its separate fields, and are now entering an
epoch where the; synthetic factors are acquir
ing ! a greater and greater â¢ significance. : Con
sider for a moment. ladies and gentlemen, what
you Â¦ see to-day. In 'â¢â¢ the lecture room of a
biological Institute there speaks to you on this
Important occasion a man, who Is not only no
biologist, but who. on the other hand, was ex
pressly Invited because he Is known as the rep
resentative'of a sister science. And this man
li again the product of the | synthesis of > two
other related ' sciences, Â¦ physicB and chemistry.,
And furthermore, when this man seeks to
gather for you the best that his garden offers,'
he brings you no word of physics nor of chem
istry, but rather thoughts whose subject is the
triad â physics, > chemistry ; and biologyâ and
whose object Is a group of proolems Â«,hich in
clude these and: many 'other sciences.'- This is
no accidental matter, but the genuine, expres-
DIVISION INTO FIELDS.
Science is an organism that steadily strug
gles for self-preservation and development.
Therefore it is provided with organs for self
.regulatlon, by means of which the useful is
furthered and the harmful suppressed. Now
such organs can only come Into action after
thet<e processes which are to be regulated
are themselves In action. Thus each retrulator
cannot, under any condition, act without a
certain lag. From this It follows that science,
like any other self-regulating apparatus, must
oscillate about an average condition. This av
erage condition Is not necessarily unchangeable
with the time; on the other hand. It is in our
case In a state of uninterrupted progress, be
cause science may only Increase â it can never
diminish. Further we have several sources of
energy, each with Its own regulating appar
atus: therefore we have to do with a num
ber of superimposed periods which ' will give
js a rather complex picture, and occasionally
for example, by. the addition of several max
ima or minima, which are in themselves small
a very large elevation or depression may bo
produced.
Here, also, we arp, to a certain extent, Im
pressed with the superiority of science, for,
while we do not doubt that such scientific
results as were cited above will last so long
us ciiUuro itself lasts, we hestitate to utter
the game Judgment upon tho artistic produc
tions. We cannot denjf that there are traces
of age in Aeschylus, 11 e., passages which
most certainly do not produce the Fame effect
upon ur as they most certainly did upon the
people of Aeschylus' own times. And it is
likewise j>oselble for us to think of times when
the 'ninth symphony will no longer be able
to produce nny greater effect than Is now pro
duced by a symphony of Haydn's.
This points to the possibility that art Itself
ls> destined to become gradually absorbed by
Fclence. I am willing to believe that this
point of view will find very active, and even
angry denial. I ivl*h to nay, therefore, that
personally 1 have to thank art for many ele
vated and beautiful hours; poetry, muKto and
painting have refreshed me and given me
now courage when, ' exhausted by scientific
work, I have been forced to lay my tools aside.
Hut I cannot but feel that this In a sign of
imperfection, and not so much of the lnipor
fectlon of science na of my own self. For
pclence, in the i?enpe In which I speak of it
to-day, exists only - in Its beginning*, and the
human organism has not progressed far in its
adaptation to it. Thus all of us suffer more
or lesB from atavistic tendencies, which find
their clearest expression in our perpetual com
plaining about the uninterrupted growth of
science In scope and in complexity. Thus we;
and likewise our children and grandchildren,
will MM enjoy many beautiful and grand
hours under the Influence of art, for there
will always be fields of human experience
into which science has hot yet penetrated,
nnd In which art will rule without any lim
itations. But it Is likely that to a future race,
Â¦which has sained control of the science of
psychology, many a treasured psychological
drama of the day will appear as naive and In
sufficient as the first attempts of a four-year
old child at picture making.
ART IS CHANGEABLE.
But when we have once learned to look upon
science as that which controls our whole life,
then we know of nothing more powerful nor
more worthy of reverence.
Another problem of transformation faces tho
modern biologist, namely, that of transforming
one species Into another. If living organisms
have arisen ' from : dsad matter the first forms
of living matter must : have been simple In
structure, and perhaps not more complicated
CHANGING. OF SPECIES.
One of the fundamental problems of biology
Is to find a definite answer to the question
whether or not It Is possible to make living
matter out of dead matter. No one
has thus far succeeded In trans
forming dead matter Into living matter,
and no one has thus far observed the spon
taneous generation of .an organism In nature.
In consequence of this fact Arrhenius assumes
that living matter has eternally existed, and
has been carried through the universe from
star to star in the shape of extremely minute
particles, such as spores at or below the limit
of microscopic visibility.. lie has calculated
that electrical charges of these particles ami
radiation pressure suffice to bring about a
transmission of living particles from one star
to another in & comparatively short time. On
the other hand, however, we are warned by a
number of -reasons not to be too hasty in as
suming the impossibility of ablogenesls. As
far as we know, the substances found In liv
ing organisms are chemically well character
ized ' and can be obtained outside of living
organisms. Moreover, the growth of an animal
or plant from a microscopic germ to Its adult
state depends upon a constant transformation
of 'dead matter into livlnz matter. Did this
transformation not occur contantly. In all liv
ing beings no living organism would be left
to-day. As far as the dynamics of this trans
formation of dead matter Into living matter In
side of an organism Is concerned we know that
no other specific agencies are evolved than
enzymes. The action of enzymes, however,
does not seem to differ in any way from the
action of Inorganic catalytic agencies. I do
not think It too bold to prophesy that the gen'
eral physio-chemical character of these en
zymes will sooner or later be cleared up. AÂ»
regards the oxidizing enzymes the goal seems
â¢ be already in sight.
Dr. Loeb, who was then introduced, said
that the dedication of a new laboratory
intended for scientific research Is an event
In which everybody, may rejoice and
which no one need regret. The presence
of Dr. Ostwald, he said, was the great
est distinction which could be bestowed
upon the university by the scientific
world. It is being recognized that the
economic, hygienic and Intellectual pro
gress of a nation depends directly upon
the results of scientific research. Ameri
can universities are just taking their tirst
steps toward giving research that place
which it has occupied for several gen
erations in European and especially Ger
man universities. If one of the leaders
of scientific thought Is willing to leave
his work to participate in the Inaugura
tion of a laboratory on the Pacific Coast
we may be sure that the new departure
of American universities has won for this
country the sympathy of European na
tions. Continuing, he said in part:

is It Impossible completely to represent a phy
sical phenomenon with the aid of rnathematic3
alone. We can, for- example, mathematically
represent tho phenomena that are connected
with the conduction of an electric current
with that degree of accuracy which is at
tainable by the present methods of analysis.
But we cannot mathematically represent the
difference between this process scaA the con
duction of heat through the same body, for
here there are found new. sorts of manifold
ness which are not treated In mathematics,
but first receive attention Irl physics.
Since now the mechanists and the Yitallsts
look at the matter from opposite sides, we
have the remarkable phenomenon that In both
camps prominent and thoughtful inveytisitors
maintain apparently contradictory points of
view, 'while it Is Impossible that there be more
than one truth. And we know the members
of both camps to be earnest and upright
seekers after truth.

NECESSITY FOB SCIENCE.
Harmon Gymnasium was crowded with
students and guests, all eager to partici
pate in an epoch-making event and to
pay homage to two famous menâProfes
sors Ostwald and Loeb. The distinguished
guests were cheered and cheered again
and fairly bewildered with the college va
riety of yells. With a wave of his hand
President Wheeler at last silenced the
cries and introduced Professor Ostwald
in a brief syeoch.
Professor Optwald is the typical Ger
man university man. He is not tall, but
broad, and he givts the imprepsion that
he is a great worker, as, indeed, he is.
His marvelous di?coveries in the field of
physical chemistry have mada him world
famous and he is accounted the greatest
chemist. He is a graduate of the Univer
sity of Dorpat, Russia, where he acted as
instructor until 1Â£>37, when he was called
to Leipzig. His address to-day was spo
ken In German, in which he Bald in part:
The event which we celebrate to-day Is like
'the launching of a beautiful ship. The keel
hasi l^en laid with great care, slender and
powerful the hull in made, and engines and
propeller are of the newest and best cdnatruc
tlcn. Above all we know that the captain is
a man wh-> undfretanda how surely and fear
lessly to fte<-r the ship over the high seas of
science, for we all know of the wonderful Jour
neys that he has already made and of the
fairy-like treasures which he has thereby won.
So we may not only wish our proud ship a
favorable and successful journey, but we may
predict it with all the certainty that la pos
sible in human affairs. Only one question Is
unanswered: What will the weather be?
A scientific Journey of to-day Is much like
a Journey of geographical discovery of five
hundred years ago; unknown land lies all
around us and we will make new discoveries In
whatever direction we may overstep the boun
daries of the unknown.
Professor Ostwald, Mrs. Phebe Hearst,
Presidents "Wheeler and Jordan and Pro
fessor Loeb brought up the rear of the
procession. At Harmon Gymnasium,
â¢where the exercises were held, the pro
cession separated into two files and, open
ing ranks and facing Inward, the several
groups marched upon, the stage, the or
der of the procession being reversed.
WAEMLY RECEIVED.
The exercises began with a procession,
which formed in front of the library
building just before 3 o'clock. The mem
bers of the faculties In full academic re
galia, and the University Cadet officers
In full uniform made an imposing specta
cle. These moved in double file, with the
graduate assistants leading, followed by
instructors, professors, alumni officers,
regents and guests, all marshaled by Pro
fessor Frank Soule. *

The dedicatory address was delivered
by Professor Wllhelm Ostwald of
Leipzig, the greatest of all living cnem
lsts, who came half-way around the world
for this very purpose. Professor Jacques
Loeb, his former pupil and intimate
friend, and at whose solicitation he came
to California, spoke, too, his words deal
ing with the significance of the laboratory
that bears his name.

The fact that we do not as yet recognlxe
thia irresistible power of science as a subject
of doily- thought and experience is the reason
why the. feeling of reverence does not arise in
us . with such strength . when ; we . think at
pclence as it " does when we think of thXie
things whose ' greatness and strength we have
been accustomed to honor from our youth uj>.
Many cf my friend?, and particularly those
whom I especially esteem, have made a most
strenuous objection to this point Of view, when
we have discussed these matters, from which
I hold that it Is probable that this objection
has occurred to you. We are accustomed to
eonnect sensations with those, things which we
have dlscufcsed, to which we ascribe a great
value and which we permit to exert a great
influence upon up. We Took at the moral an'i
political lawa with a different feeling from
that with which we look at the laws of physics
cr of chemistry, with a feeling which we call
reverence. And then there Is another great
flclci that seems to be entirely withdrawn from
the influence of science, and which neverthe
less exerts a Â«?reat and valuable Influence on
our lives, namely, the field of art. | Here also
there are more or less stirring sensations which
move us, antl lead us to believe that art is
something which carries us beyond our com
mon nature and our ordinary condition. This
sensation of the beautiful, the great, the strong,
the eternal, we do not wirh to destroy or to
diminish, and therefore those who see tho
value and charm of life In these things pro
test violently * against their absorption by
science, ascribing to science sobriety and cold
ness, the exact opposltes of those sensations*.
.Von 1 , In such an audience as this, where
each of us in some way or other has dedicated
the better part of his life to science, I' do not
need to speak of so elementary a thing as the
fact that science certainly demands soberness
and coldness from its children. In so far as
matters of criticism are concerned, 1. e., | In so
far as the proving of their work is concerned,
to determine whether it ls/eound and trust
worthy or not. But none trie less, science de*
rnands of us reverence; reverence before that
which Is the most enduring things that we
know; reverence before, truth. This results
from the fact that there Is no running- away
from the truth. No matter how hidden an
error may be; no matter how well it may be
disguised in the clothing of truth; we all know
that It will nevertheless be discovered . and
driven forth, that the Inner life of science
knowa how to put to rout all such foreign
enemies with Irresistible power. .And indeed
this process takes place the more rapidly and
energetically, the more free the communica
tion between the true and the false members
of the organism, because in this way the un
bearable character of the false is sooner real
ised. Only such errors â¢ can maintain them
selt'es in the scientific organism for consid
erable periods as exist in Isolated portions of
the organism, like an enclosed foreign body
and have only a mechanical relationship to the
other portions of science. Therefore there Is
no better way to test the truth of a scientific
concept ' than, to bring It Into connection' with
as many parts of science as possible. We shall
have occasion to discuss this matter more thor
oughly later. . â¢ â¢ ,
VALUE OF ART.
Possibly the objection will be made here
that we are accustomed to look upon the law
makers and political organizers, and not upon
discoverers and lnventcra, as the leaders of
mankind, and it will be well to bring this ap
parent contradiction into order at this point.
We indicate both the regularities of natural
processes and arDltrarlly influenced action of
mankind with one and the same word, name
ly, "law." The truly great thing which the
moral and political law-makers have done lies
in the fact that they have brought ce.rta.ln
fields of human action to the possibility of
prediction. Since they did not know the In
ternal causes of these action?, It was neces
sary to give the external rules, or law*, in
the juristic fcense. These may agree more cr
less with the psychological and biological laws
which are applicable to the phenomena In
question. The closer this agreement, the more
permanent have been these laws, and the
greater and more influential have these law
makers been. Thus every political and moral
organization 1b iubject to biological condi
tions, and at the same time those fields are
tnewn to be euch as are destined to fall un
der the irresistible conquest of science.
If we ack ourselves what Is the most general
process which has been operative in historical
times well known to us and is still operative
we recognize the fact that this procees is the
conquest of all intellectual fields by science.
When we picture to ourselves the most primi
tive conditions in the development of man
kind we eee that without doubt that that in
dividual and that people that best foresaw the
conditions of the future in the end has always
been victorious in the struggle for existence,
for it knÂ»w beet how to influence conditions.
There are indeed conditions in which* the fist
fight, I. e., physical strength, seems to decide
the pojnt. But even here we see skill, that is
the intellectual or scientific factor, cdunterbal
ance a very considerable portion of mere brute
strength, and this portion Increases as devel
opment progrecses. The greatest leaders of
humankind have always been those who most
clearly foresaw the future.
losophy Â¦ as well as of the common factors in
the individual sciences. But from both sides
one can see the undoubted tendency toward the
development of Just this field of knowledge,
and we may expect to see in the near future
the development of a "biology of science." Â¦
In reality. we have here to do with a true
biolijglcal problem. A rock or a comet has no
need of science, because, in so far as we are
capable of judging, their existence has no
meaning to them. But we, who not only wish
to maintuirj our position, but also to better it,
need science in order to do this, for in order
tu attain to anything we must know our con
dltiunB of existence, and in order to improve
anything we must know the possibilities of in
fluencing these conditions. The broadest and
surest knowledge that we have of these things
is that which we call science.

Oal^and Office San Francisco Call,
1HS Broadway, Aag. 20.
The Sin Francisco, Oakland and San
Jose Railroad Company's new ferry-boats,
Yerba Bucna and San Jose, lying at the
United Engineering: Company's "Works on
the eouth side cf Oakland harbor, east of
Alice-6trÂ«:t drawbridge, have been put
under the protection of an armed posse of
men, carrying buckshot-loaded shotguna,
and under strictest orders to permit no
unauthorized person to approach tho big
yellow painted vessels. Too OTvners of the
steamers, combined with the management
of the works, have drawn a deadline
fcbout the property and the craft, and the
demonstration of force will be continued
until the vessels are ready to go Into ser
vice.
Ail of these preparations for defense
_ar.d protection result from the mysterious
and unexplained attempts of two m&i to
board the vessels in. the guise of insur
ance company representatives.
The first effort was made last Saturday
â¢night, when the pair of visitors went to
:he ferry-boats and demandd that they
'be allowed to go aboard the boats and re
main there as employes of a marine in
surance company. The two watchmen
employed by the terry company refused
to allow the strangers admission to either
the Yerba Buena or the San Jose. The
uninvited callers were told that If they
had proper credentials they could board
the boats, but not otherwise. The callers
persisted until word was sent to W. F.
Kelly, general manager of the Oakland
Transit Consolidated, and also to Man
ager Christy of the United Engineering
Works.
STBANGEBS ARE EJECTED.
Manager Kelly went to the pier and
demanded to know who the visitors were
and whom they represented. The replies
were bo unsatisfactory that Manager
Christy of the shipbuilding company was
called upen, with the idea that he might
be able to solve the mystery. But Christy
could not throw any light on the situ
ation. He isuod orders that the visitors
must leave the premises. The works'
watchmen carried out instructions by
ejecting the unwelcome intruders and
warning them that they would be filled
full of lead if they attempted to come on
the property again.
As soon as he returned from the steam
rrs to his office. Manager Kelly ordered
shotjruns and ammunition sent to the
boats, and the guards were Instructed to
ktep constant watch day and night. On
the lar.d side the watchmen at the works
at Dickie's shipyards, adjoining, and
those on the steam schooner Brunswick,
lying next to the new ferry steamers,
wt re also instructed to keep a sharp look
out.
Matters remained in that condition un
til Tuesday, when the two men returned ,
to the steamer and a sain dpmanded to be
allowed to board.' Under instructions from
Kelly and Christy, they were driven off
at the point of shotguns, the persuasive I
exhibition af the loaded weapons proving
sufficiently strong to accomplish the pur
pose.
AJEtMED MEN ON GUARD.
Since then the armed patrol at the fer
ry-boats nnd in the- vicinity of their place
of docking has bf-cn maintained. The of
ticials of the Oakland Transit Consoli
dated declare they are absolutely in the
dark for an explanation of the strange
action of the mysterious visitors. Inves
tigation has bf-cn started by the company
to solve the^mattc-r and to determine if
possible what was the real motive of the
visit. The company'? officers profess ig
norance of any move by Insurance com
j anfes to plaop puards on the boats. They
;irv- not satisfied yet that the purported
credentials shown by the men are regu
lar, because thiy do not understand why
the insurance ppoplo should not l.ave
st-nt directly to the company's offices if
they desired to put watchmen on the
boat* or wanted to board them for any
purpose.
Concerning the episode John Q. Brown,
assistant general manager of tho Oakland
Transit Consolidated, paid to-day:
Mr Kelly was notified Saturday about
these men he 'immediately went to rvc them,
l.iey claimed "to fcavc been' sent to the steam

Thc v experience and testimony
of some of the most noted women
of America jro to prove, beyond
a question, that Lydia JE. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound will
correct all such trouble at once
by removing: tho cause, and re-
storing' the organs to a healthy
and normal condition.
"I have seen cases where women
doctored for years without permanent
benefit who were cored in less than
three months after taking your Vege-
table Compound, while others who
were chronic and incurable came out
cured, happy, and in perfect health
after a thorough treatment with this
medicine. I have never used it myself
without gaining great benefit. A
few doses restores my strength and
appetite, and tones np the entire
system. Your medicine has been tried
and found true, hence I fully endorse
it."â Mrs. R. A. AXDXHSOS, 225 Wash-

" There are but few wives and
mothers who have not at times en-
dured agonies and such pain as only
women know of. I wish such women
knew the value of L>ydia E. Pink-

is a remarkable medicine, different in
action from any other I ever knew and
thoroughly reliable. MSB

Mrs. Anderson, a prominentWASHINGTON. Aug. 2ff.-Minister
Beaupre at Bogota has been asked by the
State Department to send more, definite
information concerning proceedings about
the Isthmian canal treaty, but there is no
"way of telling how long the message will
be delayed, owing to the interruption of
telegraphic communication between Bue
na Ventura and Bogota. The fact that
two messages of the same date reached
the department with an Interval of four
days between them shows how irregular
this mode of communication has become.
The trouble seems to be with the land
lines and it Is understood that heavv
tropical growths have interfered with the
wires. The only dispatch received to-day
from Minister Beaupre was dated the 12th
and was very indefinite, although lt con
veys the Impression that further efforts
are being made to secure favorable action
upon the treaty. The Costa Rican Min
ister called upon Acting Secretary Adee
to-day, but lt was stated that his visit
was one of courtesy and had no reference
to the isthmian canal.

The rate of reinsurance on the British ship
Aristides was advanced yesterday to 25 per
cent. She is out S6 days from Caleta Buena
for this port. The Aristides Is noted for her
speed, and on that account anxiety for her
safety Is manifesting . itself earlier. than it
would in the case of the average windjammer.
While the underwriter* -are uneasy, sailor folk
profess to have no fear for the vessel. The
professional opinion peems to be that she has
struck one of the long-lived calms so prevalent
in the waters she must traverse. The French
bark Colbert, quoted at 20 per cent on the over
due list, arrived yesterday at Dunedln. The
Helen Brewer remains at S3 per cent and the
Milton Park at 75 per cent. The French ship
Madeleine, out ITS days from Antwerp for
Tacoma, is quoted at 10 per cent.

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. Aug. 20.â Trading In wheat waÂ»
of a light character and a nervous feeling pre
vailed. Favorable weather In the Northwest,
together with Indifferent cables, caused much
commission house selling at the start and open
ing prices were weak, September being do*fh
%c at 80% to 80%c. Everything seemed to
favor the bears, outside markets being lower,
while the primary receipts wero large and crop
advices favorable. With ' little demand the
market gradually declined until September had
touched 79%c, when buying orders became
more numerous and a rally ensued. The latter
part of the session was dull and featureless,
but prices held about steady. September closed
%@%c lower at 60%Â©SO%c.
There was only a small trade In corn and
prices were lower under the Influence of con
tinued favorable weather in wheat. Heavi
nens prevailed the latter part of the sc^alon
and September closed lc lower at 51c after
felling between 50%<?51%c. December closed
at 51 %e, a loss of %c.
Oats were again relatively steady, although
the weakness In wheat and corn had s6me
effect. After ranging between 34VsO34Vic
and 34%c. September closed at 34%c. a gain
of %c. December was also up %c, closing at
36?ic.
Provision were firm, chiefly because of a let
up in the telling pressure, which had been In
evidence recently. There was a good de
mand for ribs early, and with a small run 01
hogs and a stronger market at' the yards, pro
visions prices advanced materially and held
well throughout the day. September pork
closed 25c higher, September lard was up 20c
and ribs were up 20 cents.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â Chicago declined, hut recovered
somewhat toward the close. The bulls of the
day before were selling, and the market was
heavy on bear news frcm the Northwest, thÂ«
crop returns .being better, the weather perfect
and foreign cables slow. Threnhing reports
were generally favorable. St. Louis reported
higher cable bids from the Continent and a
good outside demand.
Bolton. de Ruyter & Co.'s Chicago wires
said: "The weather is fine for harvesting' In
the Northwest. The Northwestern Miller
figuring on the same basis of acreage used by
the Commercial West, estimates the North
western croo at 155,000,000, or .'fO.OOO.OOO be
low last year. Price Current estimates total
crop at 670,000,000, or same as last year. St
Louis sharply Increased its premium for cash
.Wheat and Kansas City was steady and un
changed. Exporters report continental bids on
Wheat Increasing. As whatever export busi
ness done must practically be done In the
Southwest, It 'is rather difficult to ascertain
the amount. Clearances for the day, however,
! .were nothing. Weather in United Kingdom
continues unfavorable and European crop re
ports generally are rather disappointing
Liquidation In this market has been general
and considerable short interest created. Pri
mary receipts are below last year and likely
to continue so. We are still of the view that
the cash position will control the market and
that speculators will be forced to adjust them
selves thereto. In the natural course and with
the action" of foreign markets export demand
should Increase. We advise purchasing Wheat
on the breaks." . ..
This market showed no change, either In
futures or cash grain.

prices under a good demand for shipping and
local use. Salinas Burbanks were well cleaned
up and firm. Five cars are expected for to
day's market. There, were no Merced . Sweet
Potatoes received, but 'offerings from other sec
tions sold well at previous prices. Onions were
moderately active and steady for fancy, but
weak for common offerings.
Receipts of Tomatoes were less liberal than
on the preceding day, but were easier, the high
prices having checked the demand. A few
email lots of fancy sold at $2 per box, but the
general run of supplies sold within the quoted
range of prices. There was very little In
quiry for String and Wax Beans and prices
were largely nominal. Cucumbers, Summer
Squash and Green Corn were fairly steady,
but other descriptions were in free supply and
dull. . ,

Poultry and. Game.
.Poultry ruled easy under a limited demand
and heavy supplies. Two cars of Western were
! on sale and met with a fair demand at good
prices. There .were liberal receipts of domestic
and large old stock continued to command good
prices. Young stock was dull and quotations
had a sharp decline owing to the smallness of
most of the offerings. Another car of Western
is scheduled for to-day*s market. Game ar>
rived freely and was weak in sympathy with
Poultry, and Hare were quoted lower.

. Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter rules steady at the recent advance
and Is selling oft very well, though the de
mand is not especially eharp. Some houses
which are carrying large stocks report thÂ«
market dull and easy.
Cheese remains as before quoted. The mar
ket is well supplied and trade Is not brisk.
The firmness in Eggs continues and soms
dealers are trying to obtain an advance. Stocks
continue moderate. Store Eggs have advanced
again and the inside quotations for ranch have
been moved up somewhat, as will be seen.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The Fruit market had an easier ton* than
on the preceding day. there being very little
Inquiry for shipping and less snap to the local
trade. The local demand was brisk during a
few hours In the morning, particularly for flno j
table Peaches. Pears and fancy . Gravensteln
Apples in Â¦ four-tier boxes, but during the |
greater part of the day the market was lifeless
and presented a topheavy appearance There
was very little demand for Fruit in bulk, as
tho cannera were indifferent buyers, being lib
erally supplied with contract stock. Pears con
tinued steady under, light receipts, while there
was no- Inquiry whatever for Peaches. Oood
canning Plums would sell readily at $20^23
per ton, but there were not enough In the
market for a quotation. Plums and common
Apples were In free supply and were hard to
'sell. Nectarines of good quality met with
prompt sale at good figures. There was a
good showing of second crop Figs from Vaca
ville and Sonoma and prices ranged lower.
Grapes in small packages were dull, while of
ferings In large open boxes sold oft well. About
200 boxes of Zlnfandel Wine Grapes came in'
from Antloch and were offering at $28 per ton,
with no takers. Cantaloupes and Nutmeg
Melons arrived freely from the river districts
and -were easy at a lower range of prices.
Watermelons were fairly active and steady,
the market being pretty well cleaned up.
There were liberal receipts of Strawberries and
Blackberries, and as most of the receipts
were of poor quality prices ranged . lower.
Raspberries cleaned up quickly at good prices.
Pomegranates appeared from Oroville and were
offering at 75c@$l per small box, but found
few buyers, owing to the greenness and small
size of the fruit.
Citrus and . Tropical Fruits were In ample
supply and prices had no quotable change*.

Provisions.
:" Chicago was higher on the day. This mar
ket was quiet and unchanged.
The ' Chicago wires of Bolton de Ruyter &
Co said: "Market firm and higher. Lighter
receipts of Hogs at. Western market* and re
ported material Improvement In the export de
mand for Lard were the causes. This caused
quite a free covering of local shorts. Â¦ . Outside
speculative . Interest still small. Provisions
have had a long and steady decline and some
improvement and tome reaction would certain
ly seem due. On any material advance, how
ever we think they should.be sold."

NEW TORK. Aug. 20. â There waS mor<Â»
selling of stocks this morning of the same
character as that of yesterday and lijtle resist
ance was offered. Prices in consequence, de
clined easily during the morning, and ineffec
tive inroads were made, upon the sharp ad
vances from the low level of the year which
had been achieved last week. The' reaction
has run to about 6 points in Rock Island and
Amalgamated, which were the late leaders of
the upward movement, and which have,' in
turn, led the downward movement. ! The very
large volume of the trading In Rock Island
at the top level causes a belief that a | largs
distribution of stock was effected by insiders
at that level, and has given rise to the suppo
sition in some quarters that the general, mar
ket was ui.il-r manipulation to facilitate this
operation. There was no sign any longer of
the powerful support and resistance to de
cline which helped the market upward In the
first stages of the recovery. This was ac-
I cepted by the purely speculative contingent
I as an Intimation that great banking lnsti
tutionb and influential capitalists do not
favor i further advance In prices nor an
active speculation at this time. There Is an
expectation in consequence that a i>eriod of
dullness and sluggish fluctuation lies before
the market. The rate at which the recovery
was proceeding and the extent of the specu
lative commitments which were being made
seemed to arouse apprehensions of renewed
enta.nglemer.ts which the coming requirements
upon the money market might make hazard
ous. Special significance was attached -to the
decrease of 2% in Amalgamated Copper, of 2
points in St. Paul and 4 points in Consolidated
t?as, owing to the ixjpular conception in Wall
i street that the course of these particular
stocks represents the attitude of (Standard Oil
capitalists in .the market aad.on tbe. financial
situation. The money situation is 'carefully
watched from day to day for the develop
ment of the Interior demand for currency.
Shipments to the interior have been on a
larger scale this week than last, and the bal
ance rray turn against New York at any time.
Call loan rates continue very easy, but the
time money market is hardening appreciably.
The banks point out that it is their purpose
to conserve their resources for regular com
mercial needs, and the quoted rates repre
sent the terms for those purposes. Hates oth
erwise are a matter of private exchange. The
stock market contingent is still inclined to dis
appointment over the doubt9 expressed as to
currency legislation at the coming session of
Congress. The day's movement in the grain
I and cotton markets was favorable to stocks,
the decline in prices there Indicating improved
chances for the crops. The tone of sentiment
in tb/e iron trade was more cheerful to-day,
report* Indicating that the downward course
of prices has caused some increased demand
at last. The attendance at the Stock Exchange
was reduced by visit? to the yacht races, and
after the race was under way the interest on
the floor was largely diverted to bulletin!) on
the race. With the decrease in the activity of j
the market a large short Interest was left un
covered, which showed gathering concern as
the day progressed. Prices recovered steadily
and on small dealinga. and closed steady at
about the* beÂ«t of the day. Net gains of a :
point or more are shown by a number of the
Pacifies and trunk lines, Atchison rising 2
over last nijlit.
Bonds were Irregular and turned heavy after
the opening. Total sales, par value, $ 1,322,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

have t*on made after mature consideration !>y
nifs who have every reason to know ronai

They unenimously report general buslress In
excellent con<iition and n>"t affected by the re
rent decline in Wall street. The following are
goi.<l samples of the wh<Â»le:
Tbe cashier of a bank in rittsburg: "Judg
ing from the general business conditions Â«â¢ I
jsting in Fittsturg there is no reason for the i
llfMlniilTir vteÂ» which seems to obtain In New I
York at prtsent. Business here is good, with â¢
* retuitlng str\>ng armajid for money. There j
has l*en an easing uj) in the steel business;
thÂ«rre ain-ays is to a ct-rtaan extent at this
time cf the yraT, to tak* st.H-k, make rtspalrs J
s.rA generally clean up. The rail mills are sold
up aneJ the railroads are not oancMing their
MfcÂ» lot supplies. The coal business Is ex
rrli'-rt. with k strong o>mand at good prices,
and t"r.nage irreatly in excess of last year."
The prmiirtrt cf a national bank of Atlanta,
<:'Â». : "The crop prospect is promising, though
< ttm will be some two to four week* late.
The acr^agre is considerably Increased over last
year. We expect eotid prices for cotton, and,
when realized, we art satisfied that money Â¦nil
tie easier ta this section of the country than |
ever before, as farmers do not owe very much
taootT. Taking It ail in all. we see nothing to
t* frUrntHId about reiative to the future, so
:ar as crops are concerned, or credits in this j
?action of the Tnited States. Legitimate, con
servative business jirevajle here, with very lew
exceptions. The banius loan money to mer
. hams and others upon approved notes end col
lateral. We are not affected at all by the
.icpreeiaticn of stocks in Now York, as there
are very few stocks traded in here."
The president of a bank In Austin. Tex. :
"Leaving out of account the manufacturing
mttÂ«-rtJS of this section of the State, which
Â«re small but x"*osiÂ«Â»rous, our agricultural
!>ro*peÂ»*ts probably were never better. We have
had two vearp of drouth and very, chort crops,
but. all of our croj>s for the priifcer.t year, cx
eept cotton, are now mnde, ani they are abun
dunt. The people of this 8Â«:tlon have nrver
hini larger crops of corn. oats. cane. hay. vege- I
tst'les and 'rults; ther* ts no mistake about |
this. Our cntton crop pro*- - j"i*ct is deemed ex
<â¢â¢:!â¢ nt. We have had perhaps a little too much
rein in the last few days. but. t.arrirg any un
expected calamities, we will have a luree cot
trn crop. This is our money crop, and that
means fvcrjtliing to this section of the Stale.
The present apprehension of the boll-weevil, a
p*t=t which has almost ennihi'.ated the cotton
crop in many sections of the Ptate for the lat-t
several years, is not very great. It Is not
Â»*:ieved that this ptst is likely to destroy the
ectton to any treat extent. Taking all things
into account, we feÂ«-l more cheerful here with i
r*Â«:ard to bus. ness conditions for this fall and
winter thaa we have fplt for several years."

INSANE MEXICAN ESCAPES
FROM BECE1VING HOSPITAL
Lowe had promised to give his visitor
an order for goods, but the traveling man
did not return. The police have a good
description of the confidence man.
The represented himself as
Henry Kaskell, the Western agent for
the American Tobacco Company of Chi
cago. He dropped into the Oakland Bank
of Savings this morning and presented a
draft for $420, which he desired to cash.
The bank officials refused to accept the
paper without a sufficient indorsement.
"Kaskell" departed and in the course of
a short time visited B. Bercovich, A. L.
Bruner and H. N. Bothsaw, but in each
case failed to convince the dealers that
they should guarantee his paper.
Before arriving at Oakland, "Kaskell"
tried to win the confidences of Berkeley
tobacco dealers. He first went to George
N. Lowe on Shattuck avenue, unfolded
a scheme to make Lowe un agent for his
company and then requested that Lowe
identify him at the University Savings
Bank, where the stranger desired to cash
a draft for 1112. But Lowe shied.
Kaskell"- bobbed up sdon afterward at
C. R. Hoelli's cigar stand with the same
story, but again met a rebuff when he
waved his paper. Willard Wright, an
other cigar man, was also approached,
but dodged the invitation to Indorse. Then
"Kaskell" tried his lone hand game at
the University Bank, but Assistant Cash
ier J. Mills was not doing business with
the newcomer.
Detectives have been detailed on a
search for a check swindler who made a
rushing tour of Oakland and Berkeley to
day In a bold scheme to gather up gold.
The visitor failed of his purpose, but kept
the banks of the two cities and a long
list of cigar dealers uneasy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Aug. 20.
The first reheamal. of the chorus .will be
held Thursday evening, August 27, at 6 o'clock,
at the main auditorium of the Young Men's
Christian Association building. Twelfth and
Clay streets. When the. required number of
250 singers Is obtained the list will positively
be closed. Yours sincerely^ Kdwln Dunbar
Crandall, Percy A. R. Dow" D. P. Hughes,
Clement Rowlands. Alexapder T. Stewart, com
mittee of arrangements.
Acting upon this belle?, a number of
those who are at the head of the 1 various
musical societies have made arrangements
with the directors of the Young Men's
Christian Association by which they will
be permitted to furnish and finish the
auditorium in the new building accord
ing to their own ideaa of acoustics and
art, provided they can raise the necessary
funds. So a voluntary committee of five
musical enthusiasts has undertaken the
task of raising this money and it is going
to do it by giving two festival choral con
certs at dates yet to be announced. ' The
first rehearsal is to be given on Thurs
day, August 27, at the present Y. M. C. A.
Hall. The announcement reads:
. Oakland's need of an adequate and suitable
auditorium for concerts and other affairs of
a semi-musical character has been apparent for
some time. An opportunity to secure such
an auditorium Is presented In connection with
the proposed new building of the Young Men's
Christian Association. A chorus Is to be or
ganized for the special purpose of giving- two
festival choral concerts as soon as practicable,
the proceeds to be applied to the purpose of
furnishing an auditorium in the new building.
The chorus will be limited to 250 members
and will be conducted at the rehearsals and
at the concerts by Edwin Dunbar Crandall.
Percy A. R. Dow, D. P. Hughes and Clement
Rowlands. Only- singers who aro personally
known and recommended by the conductors
of the chorus will be admitted to membership
therein, as It Is desired to 'make this the
most representative body of singers ever as
sembled in Oakland.
The musicians of Oakland have a plan
by which they hope to be able to secure
for the music-loving community of this
city a hall that will be properly built and
properly furnished for concerts and lyric
festivals, i/ia the claim of the music
leaders of Oakland that this is the largest
music-loving community in the State,
with the poorest facilities for exercising
that fondness.

Regarding the complaint of property
owners concerning the sewering of Lib
erty street, between Church and San
chez, Mrs. R. R. Fell stated that she
was ready to build the sewer, and the
property owners were given two weeks
to have the work done by private con
1 The committee referred the petition of
the Quartermaster /of the War Depart
ment that Lyon street be graded to the
official line, to the Board of Public
Works for investigation and report. The
War Department desires to build a wall
along the Presidio Reservation.
Action was postponed for two weeks on
the petition of V. Hoffman to pave with
basalt blocks, the sidewalk of Sansome
street, between Vallejo and Green, as
recommended by the Board of Works.
The second improvement will be that of
the repaying of Spear, street., from Market
to Mission, at an estimated cost of $11,600.
This work was also delayed last year "at
the instigation of property owners who
desired time to raise their sidewalk3 .to
the official grade necessitated by the work
of repaving. Supervisor Hrandensteln ap
peared before the committee and urged
that the work be done, &z everything was
now In readiness. Assistant Secretary
Keogh of the Board of Works assured the
committee that the money . necessary
would be forthcoming, but he requested
that the necessary authority for the
building of the Sixth-stret sewer be also
passed, and the committee acquiesced. It
Is expected that the cost of repaving
Spear street will exceed the first estimate
of $11,600, owing to the increased cost of
basalt blocks.
The first ordinance will deal with the
construction of a sewer In Sixth street,
bids for which were Invited during the
last fiscal year. The lowest bid was
$53,000, but. as the estimate made by the
City Engineer was only ?49,00G, the City
Attorney ruled that the' contract could
not be awarded at the increased figure.
New bids will now be Invited after the
ordinance has been finally passed and the
TV L rk will be done at once.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors decided yesterday to Introduce
two ordinances at next : Monday's meet
ing of the' board for the doing of street
work, the aggregate cost of whffch will be
$65,000.
With regard to the marking of the
grain bags, the bookkeeper testified that
some of -the sacks bore old numbers, but
that a variance in numbers was discov
ered only in one instance, that when an
old number had been covered by a new
one. The different lots were taken up
separately and discussed. He had marked
some of them and was always guided by
Superintendent Dexnlng. . : ; .". ;
Henry C. Bunker of the Merchants* Ex
change told how he had gone to Crockett
with an order from the Eppingers for the
purpose of. claiming grain for. the.Amer
ican National Bank and the Bank of Mon
terey. He was directed by Demlng to
the different lots he had made a record
of and said the banks held warehouse
f eceJpts for everything claimed. Attorney
David Freidenrich, who represents nearly
all the banks, with the exception of these
two, attempted . to show that the ware
house people had "tipped" the two banks
of the coming failure and that they
hastened to satisfy their claims before
the crash, regardless of to whom the
grain they marked belonged.
The hearing: In the Eppinger bankruptcy
case was continued before Referee Milton
Green yesterday morning. The session
before noon was devoted to the examina
tion of Edmond Freund, who, for the past
ten years, had been bookkeeper for the
insolvent firm. In the afternoon Henry C.
Bunker, grain expert for the Merchants'
Exchange, took the etand and after he
had been Questioned by the attorneys rep
resenting the different factions an ad
journment was taken until next Wednes
day morning at 10:30 o'clock.
When the hearing was called to order
the room was filled with, legal represen
tatives. Attorney Henry Ach looked out
for the Eppinger end and principal among
the bank representatives were David
Freidenrich, Attorney Chickering. Q. C.
Van Ness and Gavin McNab. Frequent
objections were made, particularly by
Ach, and at one time in the afternoon the
proceedings came nearly to a halt that
the court might be given an opportunity
to decide as to the admlseibility of cer
tain evidence. As it was,, numerous ob
jections were made and numerous ques
tions were certified to the court for a de
cision as to their propriety.
Freund was asked particularly con
cerning the disappearance of the ware
house books. He professed absolute
Ignorance of the matter and 6aid Dem-
Ing furnished him with the information
that they had been taken to San Fran
cisco, where they were needed. On the
day before the closure, and about 10
o'clock atnight. the books were placed in
a dry goods box on the wharf and
wrapped in burlap. Witness did not know
what became of them or to whom they
had been shipped. The San Joaquin an*
t barge were at the wharf that night
and came on to the city. The missing
records may have been taken on board,
but Freund would not swear that such
was the case.
"It was I, and not Nolan, that stopped
Whitelaw from beating Mrs. Mathews.
Nolan sneaked to court and pleaded
guilty to gain the little benefit that was
due me by stopping Whitelaw from beat
ing Mrs. 'Mathews. I have good, honor
able folks that I would not want to bear
the disgrace of my being implicated in
the assault on a poor, defenseless woman.
I have too much respect for women to
be guilty of any such thing."
The Judge In passing sentence said that
he believed Davis 'when he said that he
did not know that any one was at home
and that he went simply for Che purpose
of committing burglary. Nolan had been
the instigator of the crime, and the heav
ier sentence had on that account been
given him. Such crimes must be stopped
and the perpetrators must be made an
example of so as to deter others from
following in their footsteps.
This ends the fate of the quartet con
cerned in the brutal crime. Docia Nolan
has been sentenced to eight years, Ber
nard Whitelaw to imprisonment for life,
Michael Nolan to twenty-five years and
John Davis to twenty years.
Eugene Eagan, an ex-convict, who was
convicted by a jury in Judge Dunne's
court on a charge of robbery, was sen
tenced yesterday to serve ten years in
San Quentin. He held up Peter Madera
of 606 Second street at the Second street
bridge on the night of April 17 and robbed
him of $1, which Madera had borrowed
from a friend a few minutes prior to the
hold-up.
Davis asked the privilege of making a
statement under oath. He was sworn and
testified that he had been willing to plead
guilty at the first calling of the case,
but was dissuaded by-Michael Nolan, who
said be could beat the case. Nolan, said
Davis, was not in the house at the com
mission of the crime, but plotted it. Nolan
said Docia Nolan had told him that
there was $4000 in the house, as she knew
it through Mrs. Tuttle's little daughter,
who had told her niece. For two weeks
prior to the crime Nolan had been con
stantly after him to commit the crime.
"On the morning of March 4," Davis
continued, "Nolan came to my room and
told me to get up, as the others had gon^
out there and that everything was clear,
the folks having gone away. Nolan said
there was $4000 or $5000 in it. I had been
and was under the influence of opium and
drink and did not fully realize what 1
was doing when I consented to go, and
had I known there was anybody at home
I would never have went.
John Da\iÂ», one of the thugs who beat
and robbed Mrs. Emma V. Mathews at
the home of her daughter, Mrs. Ida E.
Tuttle, 543 Halght street, on the after
noon of March A, pleaded guilty to a
charge of robbery before Judge Cook yes
terday morning. He asked for the le
niency of the court, and the Judge sen
tenced him to serve twenty years in San
Quentin.

Dan I. Danziger, aged 10 years, and Miss
Katherine I. McGivney, aged 27 years, were
married yesterday afternoon by Justice of the
Peace Lone In the chambers of. his court.
i Last Monday the couple eloped to San
Joee and the groom applied for a license. At
the same time a message was received by the
police In San Jose, from the parents of the
groom, stating that he was under age and not
to (grant . him a license. The couple were
forced to abandon their wedding and return
to this city.
Danziger, after much pleading, finally se
cured his parents' > consent, and yesterday
afternoon they accompanied him to the office
of the County Clerk and the license was Is
sued. . The bride was formerly married to a
man named Martin, but she was granted a
divorce and permission to resume her maiden

In the suit for divorce brought by Mary
A. Clark asralnst James Clark, an em
ploye of : the [ hardware firm of j Baker &
Hamilton, a motion for a nonsuit was
taken under submission by Judge Gra
ham yesterday. Â¦ The motion was made
by Clark's attorneys after the -hearing
of considerable testimony which showed
that both plaintiff and defendant wero
equally. blamable for their only too evi
dent marital unhapplness.
The court suggested to the Clarks that
there was a chance of both living hap
pily together if they would take a pledge
not to drink liauor for a year, the sug
gestion coming after Mrs. Clark had tes
tified, that she drank beer and scent 20
cents a day keeping a ; lard palL f ull of
the froyiy leverage, and Clark had said
that his breakfast usually consisted of
a glass, of whisky.
The suggestion was not taken kindly
by either of the litigants, so Judge Gra
ham took another tack, and suggested
that for'the benefit of their six children
they should kiss and make up.'
- "Come, now, Mrs. Clark, kiss your hus
band and go home with him," said the
court, beaming kindly upon the plaintiff.
"Kiss -him!", almost shouted the hard
ware man's wife. Jumping out of her
chair; "I'd rather kiss a Chinese."
This ended Judge Graham's efforts to
effect a. reconciliation, but he refused to
grant the divorce. . ,Â¦Â¦â¢ .
Judge Troutt made an order yesterday
directing Elden S. Darrow. an employe

efforts to get alimony is a systematic

therefore she does not need his aid, par
ticularly as she refuses to live with him.

Our southern neighbors also claim that they
should be reduced because Los Angeles County
has had its assessment Increased $53,000,000
this year, and they point disparagingly to our
smaller increase this year. They do not refer
to the fact that while their county has for the
pagt four years had a low assessment, San
Francisco was raised by me in one year more
than $50,000,000. and that in four years our
roll has been increased by $75,000,000. They
evidently would penalize San Francisco be
cause her property has been fairly assessed for
four years while theirs remained low. Again,
the fact is not brought forward in this con
nection that they are comparing Los Angeles
County, with an area of 414^ square milea,
with the city of Ban Francisco, with an area
of 46 square miles. Nor is it considered that
the population of Los Angeles city increased in
ten years from 50,395 to 102.479. -a gain of
more than 100 per cent, while in the same pe
riod San Francisco gained less than 20 per
cent This <s one .occasion on .which our
Southern competitors instituted no comparison
as to growth in population and -wealth between
these two cities. In this eame period Los An
geles County increased in population 70 per
cent. Is it not to be expected that her wealth
would Increase with her population? W't hear
a great deal of the stream of wealth that has
been flowing into the south from Eastern
States and of her orange orchards at $1000 an
acre Why should not her assessment roll
show a proportionate Increase? And when
our city has presented an increase of $75,CO0,
000 as against the tardy increase of $50,000,
000 In her county, why should the State board
entertain this as an argument in favor of
raising San Francisco? I do not believe they
W 'in the increase from $300,000,000 in
1890 to $425,000,000 in 1903. shall the burden
of our taxpayers be increased now by the ac
tion of thÂ» State board? Â¦'.Â¦
When all the facts are before the board,
when the misleading evidence that has been
presented to It shall have been refuted, as I
will fee that It is. then I trust that the fact
will be recognized by our State board that
for five years past San Francisco has poured
her full quota of taxes Into the State treasury.
ASSESSMENT INCREASED.
I am dally interviewed by taxpayers who are
protesting against any such contemplated
action knowing their assessment to be now
not only reasonable but Just. To our taxpayers
and to our owners of real estate I desire to say
that when the proper time cornea the State
board will be Informed of the true condition' in
Ban Francisco. Misleading and untrue state
ments which have been made to the board re
garding San Francisco's present assessment by
representatives of other counties who are seek
ing to have their assessment reduced will be
refuted. These false statements have been sent
over the State as telegraphic reports of the
board's proceedings.
To illustrate: The representatives of Los
Angeles County stated that the building per
mits of San Francisco during the past year
amounted to ? 16.000.000 and that my assess
ment on these buildings was less than $2,000,
000. A more untrue statement could not be
made. Both sums are grossly erroneous. In
the first place, of the $16,000,000 of building
permits, several millions represent buildings
not yet erecterl or completed, so this sum
cannot be taken as a basis for assessment. In
the second place. tfie assessment of new build
ings for last year in San Francisco Is not
$2,000,000, as stated, but more than $7,000,000.
Yet this is evidence that is being Introduced
against San Francisco. â¢
The belief is prevalent among our largest
taxpayers that the present intention of the
State Board of Equalization is to raise my
assessment of property In San Francisco. This
belief la based upon private utterances 'by
members of the State board and upon' the ac
tion of the board in Belecilnu San Francisco
as a field for examination by an expert ap
pointed by the board.
RAISE IS EXPECTED.
.- On the subject of the proposed raise
Assessor Dodge gave out the following
statement: . Â«ir
C. M. Coglan, clerk of the State Board of
Equalization, sent a communication yes
terday to Clerk Fay of the Board or Su
pervisors to the effect that the board hav
ing examined the ! assessments upon the
assessment roll of San Francisco proposes
to. increase the entire assessment roll for
trie year 1903 except property exempt from
Increase for the purpose of making the
assessments conform to the true value of
the property contained in the roll.
The Board of Equalization will consider
all objections which may be made to such
increase at its office in the State Capitol
at Sacramento on Saturday, August 29,
1903. In all likelihood the Finance and
Assessment committees of the Board of
Supervisors and Assessor Dodge will go
to Sacramento to protest against the in
crease. "\
There are three candidates for the place,
which pays $120 per . month. , They are
Miss Kelly, for whom Director Roncovierl
stands sponsor; Miss Sullivan, who is up
held by Directors Walsh and Mark, and
Miss Martha Galloway, who has found a
staunch adherefft in Director Woodward.
Miss Kelly is now in the Mission Gram
mar School, Miss Sullivan in the Mar
shall and Miss Galloway In the Cooper
Primary School.
A compromise is now being talked of
among the directors, which, it 13 believed,
will result In the election of Miss Kelly.
Miss Sullivan, it is said. will. be, con
poled with the- possibility of another va
cancy occurring in a principalship in the
near future. It is understood that Miss
Galloway does not stand much chance to
secure the necessary votes of two school
directors in addition to Woodward.
Miss Kelly was elected into the School
Department on October 5, 1S87. She holds
a flrst grade certificate, a life diploma
and a diploma from the State Board of
Education. Miss Sullivan was elected a
teacher on August 13, 1890, and has a
certificate of the second grade and a
State educational diploma. Miss Gallo
way has also been many years in the de
partment and holds the highest creden
tials" as an educator.
The Board of Education has declined to
grant the appeal of Principal Bush of the
Polytechnic High School that Miss Irene
D. Reeves, teacher of English In the aca
demic portion of the school, be consoli
dated out of her, class., *. i _.
Bush' informed the members of the
board that' Miss Reeves was occupied only
one-half a day in teaching, the other half
being devoted to study class, and he de
sired to apply, her salary, to the technical
department of .the school. The board,
bearing in mind the fact that Miss Reeves
was. once consolidated out of the depart
ment and secured her reinstatement and
considerable back salary by decree of the
Superior Court, decided that it would be
wise to leave Miss Reeves where she is.
There Is a very pretty fight on In the
School Department over the vacant prin
clpalshlp of the Jefferson Primary School
with the chance favoring the election of
Miss Elizabeth E. Kelly, notwithstanding
that Miss Nellie M. Sullivan has already
secured the votes of two school directors
and Miss Kelly has the support of only
one.

It Is in the treatment of this most dis-
tressing of torturing and disfiguring
skin and' scalp humours, "with loss of
heir, that the Cuticura*. remedies hare
achlered their greatest success. Origi-
nal in composition, scientifically com-
pounded, absolutely pure, unchangeable
in any climate, always ready, and agree-
able to the most delicate, they present to
those suflering from Eczema the most
successful curative of modern times. We
know that this villbe considered strong
language by those acquainted with the
character and obstinacy of the disease
under consideration, but it is justified
by innumerable successes where all the
remedies and methods in vogue have
failed to cure, and, in many cases, to
relieve, even.
The first step in the treatment of the
chronic forms is to remove the scales and
crusts and soften the skin, by â¢warm
baths with Cuticura Soap. The Bcafp,
ears, elbows, hands, ankles and feet will
require frequently a thorough soaking ia
order to penetrate the thickened skin
and crusts with which these parts are
often covered. : ! Dry Â¦ carefully, and ap-
ply Cutlcura Ointment, lightly at first,
and where advisable spread it on pieces
of soft doth and bind in place. Tako

doses. Do not use cold water in bath-
