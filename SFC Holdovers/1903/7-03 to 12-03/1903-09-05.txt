made the following \ statement . to-day:
"The Czar has decided" to remain away
from Vienna during his visit to Austria,
owing to the discovery of anarchist ac
tivity in the city by the Russian secret

that the risk of a public reception would
be too great.; In consequence,' the Czar

both the State and Navy departments
will hold themselves in readiness to act
promptly if the Minister cables for as
sistance.
The officials do not anticipate that the
Sublime Porte will object to the transpor
tation of marines through the Darda
nelles to aid in the protection of Ameri
can interests at Constantinople.
The significant statement was made by
a high official to-night that it was not
the policy of this Government to let any
convention or international custom stand
in the way of effectively protecting
American lives in time of an emergency,
and the State Department is not con
cerned as to the method of transporting
marines ' to Constantinople in case the
Minister cables for their presence.

BEIRUT, Syria, Sept. 4.â The United
States cruisers Brooklyn and San Fran
cisco arrived to-day. -Rear Admiral Cot
ton immediately communicated with Con
pul Ravndal, receiving cablegrams with
instructions that superseded his sealed
orders.
' The State Department instructs the ad
miral to be in readiness to sail for the
Dardanelles at a moment's notice. Addi
tional Instructions < are given for safe
guarding the Consulate at Beirut and en
forcing amends for the attack on Magels
sen. Disorders here have ceased.
It would take the American warships
fully three days to land marines at Con
stantinople, it being about 900 miles from
here to the mouth of the Dardanelles, or
more than two and a half days" sail. As
no warships are allowed in the Darda
nelles under the existing conditions, the
marines would have to be sent up to Con
stantinople on launches.
The gunboat Machias Is bound for Port
Said to await orders. There are about ISO
marines on the three warships.

FRANCE TAKES PRECAUTIONS.
PARIS, Sept. 4.â It is authoritatively
stated that in view of the dis
orders in Turkey a French fleet will be
ordered to hold itself in readiness to
. Herran,' twice taken to task by the de
partment for his radical utterances re
garding the manner in which the depart
ment has been conducting the negotia
tions, is becoming disgusted. He has
given up all hope that the treaty will
survive and it is possible before the end
is reached he will make public a full
report of the negotiations.
Â¦ Meantime the rebel sentiment in the
isthmus in . favor of setting up an inde
pendent state embracing the Panama
canal territory grows apace, according to
the latest dispatches.
Minister Beaupre presented this mes
sage and the wrath of the Colombian
officials was centered upon him. The
State Department "was content to allow
him to become. the target for the shafts
of the irate Colombians until the author
ship of the message was traced direct to
the department. Now officials here are
standing by Beaupre and asserting he is
performing his duty satisfactorily.
WASHINGTON*. Sept. 4.â "The United
States may be forced to take action which
would be a source of regret to all true
friends of Colombia."
Such is the implied threat contained in
Hay's note, transmitted to Minister
Beaupre at Bogota, which set the Colom
bians frantic with anger, and led, it is
claimed, fo the defeat of the canal treaty.
The action implied was contingent upon
Colombia's, refusal to ratify the treaty
unamended.

'.. The advices from the American Minister
have not caused the State Department to
swerve from its original programme to
confine the operations of Lelshman and
Rear ASmiral Cotton to, the protection of
American citizens and their \ property.
This Government will not, under any cir
cumstances, become involved in the polit

HAY'S NOTE
T T J *SHIWGTOW, Sept. 4.â Swiftly has the scene
iJLJ of action in the Far East changed from
Beirut to Constantinople and another
twenty *four hours may see an American warship
speeding to the Dardanelles with marines who will
be landed to protect the American legation and the
consulate>general at the Sublime Porte. Such a
contingency the State Department hopes will not
occur, but the uneasy tone of the cablegram received
to*day from the- United States Minister shows that
the situation is growing worse. The crisis unques*
tionably is near at hand, and not only the United
States but the powers of Europe anxiously awaits
the outcome of the tremendously alarming situation.
For many years It has been practically
the uniform custom of Presidents to ap
point men to positions in the Consular
service substantially without reference r to
whatever previous experience they may
have had. Quite naturally, the President
endeavored, always to select for appoint
ment men of integrity and ability, but
experience was not a determining factor
in the equation.
President Roosevelt, after consultation
with Secretary Hay, Assistant Secretary
of State Loomis and members of his Cab
inet immediately identified with the State
Department, has determined to appoint
hereafter to Important places in the Con
sular service men who already are in the
service and have had experience and
training In minor positions which will
render them the more capable of filling
places of higher grade and greater im
portance.
The change in policy does not extend
the civil service to the Consular service,
and it does not extend, necessarily, a Con
sul's tenure of office at any particular
place; but, it is pointed out, it does give
reasonable assurance to the manufactur
ing and commercial interests of the
United States, which particularly are In
terested in the extension of the country's
trade, that in a comparatively brief time
all Important Consular positions will be
filled by men of not only character and
ability, but with men who, by training and
experience, are especially qualified to ad
vance the trade Interests of the United
States.
Mr. Loomis discussed with the Presi
dent several appointments in the service
that are to be made soon. It is under-
Stood that all the appointees will be men
who are now filling places of lesser im
portance in the service. They are to be
promoted and. In turn, their places will
be filled with men who have not had the
experience they have had.
OYSTER BAT, L. I., Sept*.â An im
portant change of policy with respect to
the making of appointments in the Con
sular service has been decided upon by
President Roosevelt. He discussed thÂ«*
change, to-day with Assistant Secretary
Loomis.

Weeks must elapse before the wounded
woman will be able to leave the hospital
if she is ever able to leave it. Meantime
it is not probable that there will be any

the institution of any proceedings which
might result in an arrest being made.'
Colonel Griffith and family had intended
returning home from their vacation to

Manager W right of the hotel Fays- he
was sitting in the office when he heard a
ecream followed by the sound of a hoavy
body striking the roof of a porch almost
immediately above the entrance to the
office. About the same time a call came
The cause of the shooting is shrouded
in mystery. Colonel Griffith declares that
the ehooting was accidental; that whfte
his wife was packing a trunk a revolver
in }t was accidentally discharged and the
bullet Etruck her In the eye; that she
fell to the floor and thus sustained a frac
ture of the shoulder blade. He denied
that there had been any quarrel between
them or that they had ever quarreled.
There were no witnesses to the shoot
ing. Colonel and Mrs. Griffith being alone
in their room at the time.
One of the brothers of the wounded
woman, in discussing the case to-night,
said:
"Mrs. Griffith did not shoot herself; the
shooting was not an accident, in our opin
ion. We are sure there was no attempt
at suicide. "We believe that her broken
shoulder blade was not sustained by fall
ing to the floor after she had been shot.
That Injury was produced by either jump
ing or falling from the window of her
room to the roof of the porch below. Why
did ehe Jump? She may be able to tell
that later. We have been unable to get
any statement from her because her con
dition will not admit of her making a
statement. She may never make one.
What will we do? Nothing, until the
members of the family have held a con
sultation and possibly not then until our
sister is 2ble to express her desires as to
what course we shall take, and we will,
of course, be guided by her wishes. As
yet we make no accusations, but we be
lieve that that shot was not accidental,
nor was It fired with suicidal Intent."
INVESTIGATION NOT LIKELY.
Mrs. Griffith has not been able to make
any lucid statement as yet, but in the
delirium following the shooting and in
her unconscious state as a result of the
administration of anaesthetics, she has
made statements and appeals which indi
cate that she imagines herself in mortal
danger and she has appealed to those
about her to save her.

The San Francisco Call.WIDEWATER, Va., Sept. 4.-The pros
pective launching to-day of Professor
Langley's big aerodrpme was abandoned
at 4 o'clock, after the port propeller, re
volving about 600 times a minute, had
wrecked itself among the rods and bars
of the machine. Both blades of the pro
peller were torn to small' pieces, and one
of the main supporting rods of the air
ship ! was bent. to. a right angle. Other
slight damage was done. The accident
was the result of a change occurring in
some unexplained manner in thÂ© orbit of
the blades. But for tho prompt action of
Professor Manley,; who was in the navi
gator's car, in shutting on! his engine the
aerodrome might have been hurled from
the superstructure and entirely wrecked.
At the time the accident occurred the
newly repaired engine was being tested.
It worked much better than it did yes
terday, and the accident was very dis
tressing to the experts, who greatly de
sired a test either this afternoon or to
morrow morning. After inspecting the
damage Professor Langley decided to re
turn to Washington. The machine may
be repaired by Monday.

is said if the embassy requires protec

call upon the commander of the British

The Foreign Office considers It proba
ble that Russia and Austria have landed
marines to protect their embassies, as a
result of the Porte's note to the Embassa

tors were projecting outrages against tho
embassies, legations and public buildings
at Constantinople. So far as the Foreign

FALL RIVER, Mass.. Bept 4.âSeven
teen cotton manufacturing concerns of
Fall River will shut down until Septem
ber 14, throwing out of work nearly 13,000
hands operating 1,300,000 spindles. The
curtailment next week is the most exten
sive of any here since the cotton situation
became unfavorable to mill owners. This
extensive stoppage of machinery will take
more than $100,000 out of circulation
through the loss of wages. The delay in
the arrival of new cotton and the situa
tion in the market and the fact that Mon
day is a holiday are responsible for the
idleness of so many spindles.

MYSTERIOUS SHOOTING IN HOTEL ROOM

from the closet and upon her persistent
refusal to tell him where she kept the
money the negro repeatedly choked her.
Neighboring women broke Into the house
after Mrs. Gerahn had been in the power
of tho negro for three hours and found
him standing over the prostrate woman
sinking his fingers into her throat
The negro hurried from the house and
ran to the Kansas River, two blocks dis
tant, where he hired a boat and ordered
the owner to row quickly to the Missouri
shore. When the boat had reached mid
stream a crowd of excited men and boys
had gathered at thÂ© bank and shouted
to the owner of the boat to return to
shore. He started to do so, when the
negro stood up in the boat and with the
remark, "I have lived too long to die at
the end of the rope," dived Into the wa
ter. He drowned before the spot could
be reached and his body disappeared.
Mrs. Gerahn is a widow 45 years of age.
Her husband, wl?o was a packing-house
employe, and her son were drowned in
the great June flood and she lived alone.
The negro, aged about 30, called at the
house about noon and, entering stealth

Gerahn at her work and demanded her
money. When she insisted that there
was none about the house the negro
threatened to kill her and, seizing her
by the throat, -began choking her. She
became unconscious and he locked her

Gentlemen, while I lost the cup, or, rather
did not succeed in winning it, I have not lost
the esteem and good will of my American
friends, which esteem and good will I recip
rocate Jn the very highest degree possible." A
great consolation to me In my unsuccessful
effort to lift the cup Is the great kindness
ehown me by all classes My feeling of grati
tude for this spirit is gTeat beyond expression.
I shall bear In mind the remembralce of your
kindly acts for all time. I am eure that aÂ«
the days and years roll toy these contests will
not have been held. In vain If they make us
realize that wherever we are. all the world
over, we shall "brothers be for a' that "
Herreshoff li the greatest designer of the
age, but I am still very hopeful that I will
Bee that cup on the other side yet. ' v .
America Is a very hard to beat and
I know It. I am a very disappointed man, but
still I have the consolation that both con
queror and conquered belong to the same good
old race. The cup Is still in the family, only
it is held by a younger and more go-ahead
generation.
I am beginning to think that there is some
magio 6pell about the bloomln' old cup Two
years ago I had it almost within my grasp
but it escaped me then as It has escaped me
now and It seems aa far oft as ever. It re
minds me of the story of the Irishman who
was asked If he could play the fiddle *'I
don't know." said he, "I've never tried it " I
have tried it and tried It again without suc
cess, but my motto has been "Try, try again "
Although I have been without success each
time I nave tried, I do not despair that some
day we shall succeed In capturing that fa
mous trophy, although I must confess that
we appear now to be more than a little bit
astern.

Dispatches from Sofia from Vienna as
sort that the war party in Bulgaria is
graining ground. The semt-offlcial Dnev
nik Is preaching a war and has revealed
the existence of an alleged Russo-Bulga
rian treaty of alliance signed by Dr. Da
nleff and General Paprikoff, lately Bul
garian Premier and Minister of War, re
spectively.
On the other hand, showing the diffi
culty of arriving at an accurate estimate
of the real condition of affairs, the Sofia
correspondent of the Daily Telegraph de
clares that Bulgaria's aversion, to war Is
Insuperable on both military and political
grounds. HÂ« asserts that the Bulgarian
Government is resolved to sedulously
avoid, everything calculated to lead to
hostilities, first on account of the Austro-
Russlan opposition, and, second, because
the army is totally unprepared for war.
Prince Ferdinand is. devoting his efforts to
staving off a decision, hoping that the
powers, for their own safety, will arrange
for a European control of Macedonia and
the restoration of peace.
The Increasingly threatening aspect of
affairs in the Balkans seriously affects all
the European capitals. What is to be
done in Macedonia is anxiously discussed
on all sides. The censorship Is active at
present, for the only news thus far of the
landing of marines emanated from Wash
ington. The subject is not mentioned In
any Constantinople dispatches received
here.
According to these dispatches, although
it is considered certain that the destruc
tion of the Hungarian steamer Vaskapu,
in the Black Sea, was the work of the in
surgents, the intention to kill Hungarian
subjects may provoke Austrian Interven
tion.
The Austrian Embassy at Constantino
ple, in the absence of convincing proofs,
has not yet taken action. The police in
the meantime are arresting Bulgarians in
all parts of Constantinople and wild ru
mors aro afloat of other projected out
rages. The Boerse is panic-stricken be
cause of the fears of war. Most active
military preparations by the Turkish
Government are proceeding and Turkish
officers are talking of their ability to
reach Sofia within three weeks from the
outbreak of war.
LONDON, Sept. 5.â The situation is crit
ical for, the Bulgarian Government, tele
graphs the Sofia correspondent of the
Times, not only on account of Macedonia,
but also because of the internal political
complications.
The Vienna correspondent of the iTlmes
reports that in various competent quar
ters the danger of a Turko-Bulgarian con
flict is reported to be graver at the pres
ent moment than at any previous junc
ture. It is believed in Vienna, he adds,
that if war breaks out it will be lees on
account. of Bulgarian sympathy with the
Macedonians than because the Bulgarians
fear the untoward consequences to their
own country of the return en masse of
the desperate disappointed insurgent lead
ers who would swamp Bulgarian public
life. -S

DR. . PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
Sickness steals more savings than the
burglar. Slowly, coin by coin, the
money that has been so hardly earned
is paid out for drugs and doctors. Sick-
ness is the worst enemy of the working
man, and the common cause of the work-
ing man's sickness is disease of the
stomach often involving the heart, lungs,
liver, or kidneys.
The use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Med-
ical "Discovery will stop the stealing of
the savings by sickness. It cures dis-
eases of the stomach and other organs of
digestion and nutrition. It cures dis-
eases of heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, etc.,
when these diseasesiare caused by the
diseased condition of the stomach and
its allied organs.

In a petition to revoke letters of guard
ianship over the persons of Isabella and
William McKenzie filed yesterday by Dan
iel McKenzie, the children's father, he
charges that Major White, secretary of
the California Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, committed fraud
upon the court that made the appoint
ment. McKenzie alleges that. White in
stead of serving subpenas upon the rela
tives of the children, as the law provides,
suppressed them, thus preventing the per
sons interested from appearing and prov
ing that his charges were wrong.

Dr. Charles Morgan, toxicologist, fur
nished much amusement for the audience
by giving a technical dennitlon of pto
maines and. by denying that he had ever
taken. any very. great quantity of arsenic
to observe the effects. He testified that
He remembered seeing Mrs. Martin
Bowers give her husband some white
powders. The patient complained once
that the prepared food did not taste right.
Harry Bowers felt certain all the time
that poisoned ham had caused the trouble.
The witness was very voluble, but the

as to why he became suspicious.

NESSES AT THE INQUEST.
. Mrs. Sutton denies that she made any
remark to Peterson about the doctor's
prescribing: arsenic. Detective . Thomas
Ryan, who has handled the case for the
Police Department, told of how he and
Detective Coleman bad secured the in
fcrmation presented to the jury. He told
what Mrs. Bowers had informed | him in
' It Â¦ was on or about August 20 'Â¦when the
woman whom I now know to be Mrs. Sutton
came to the store and presented the forged
prescription. I never filled ?uch an order
before for, any doctor. Xo quantity of the
drug was 'ppeclfled and the woman said to
give her whatever I wished and that she did
not care what it cost. This made me a little
careful and I aBked what she wanted of the
arsenic. She said it was for a sick man who
was paralyzed. I gave her an ounce and told
her what sort of a drug It was. I cautioned
her to let the doctor use it and she said she
.would do so.
' About a week later the proprietor of the
store told me that the. detectives had discov
ered something wrong. I 'Identified the pre
scription" when they came. Mrs. Harry-Bow
ers was brought into the store first. I said
she was not the woman. Then came Mrs. Sut
ton and I knew her at once. There could be
no mistake. Her face was fixed in my mem
ory mostly because we had such a talk about
her purchase that night. . She said it might
have been Mrs. Martin Bowers, but when I
saw her I knew differently.
That "night I identified Mrs. Sutton in the
office of the Chief of Police again. She said
I was mistaken and told me to ask her sister
If the doctor had .not prescribed arsenic for
Martin Bowers. I did not do so for I wanted
to perform no detective work;
Drug Clerk Peterson's testimony was
the most sensational of the day. When
asked to Identify the woman to whom he
sold the "ounce of arsenic on the forged
prescription, he rose to his feet, pointed
at Mrs. Sutton and said: "That is the
woman." His statement was as follows:
WONDERS AT PRESCRIPTION.
Deptfty Coroner M. J. Brown told how
Harry Bowers hud reported that some
thing was the matter.. The official then
telephoned to the German Hospital to
allow no one to touch the body and sent
the complainants to the police.
Coroner Leland said that he had been
requested by telephone to sign the death
certificate so that the body would not
have to be removed to the Morgue. He
replied that he would be glad to do so
after his deputies had made a thorough
investigation of the case.
The length of time that a poisoned man
might live was indefinite. Some had
lived many months. Arsenic caused a
degeneration of the tissues, which caused
death. Â¦ The poison whicn tvas found In
the dead man's stomach did no harm.
It was the arsenic which had become
dissolved. As more than rour grains of
the powder were found Toxicologist Mor
gan thought the dose muse have been a
large one.
a large quantity of the arsenious acid,
such as wasXpund In the stomach of Mar
tin Bowers, might act as an emetic and
prove less harmful than a smaller dose.
' Both returned to Follis'- saloon and the
proprietor repeated his remark about the
prospect of trouble. Harry Bowers and
his wife proceeded to the Morgue. When
the husband discovered that arrangements
had been made that his' brother's â¢ body
would not be taken to the Coroner's:of
fice he demanded an investigation. . He
told his suspicions to .' Deputy Coroner
CarJ Schmidt, the ward nurse at the
German Hospital, who attended Bowers
during his last moments, said that two
women, whom he identified in the In
quest room as Mrs. Martin Bowers and
Mrs. Harry Bowers, were present during
the afternoon while the patient was pass-
Ing away. The wife exhibited much grief
and was creating a scene. Bowers asked
for water continually, but could not hold
it on his stomach.
Mrs. Harry Bowers stated â¢ that' she
went to the hospital with her sister-in
law and described minutely what took
place there. The newly made widow did
not want to have the body go to the
Morgue and signed a receipt turning over
the remains to Undertaker Peterson. The
two women then proceeded to Mrs..But
ton's apartments at 154 Eddy street and
thence to Clementina street. There they
met I<ervey. or O'Leary, and took two or
three drinks apiece In various saloons. .
Mrs. Harry Bowers then went to Fol
lis' saloon and told the woman in charge
of the place that the bridge builder was
dead. Mr. Follls, who was present, re
marked that he knew trouble would re
sult from the whole strange affair. Mrs.
Harry Bowers said that she then hur
ried to her own house and told her hus
band of what had happened.
WOMEN VISIT DYING MAN.
lly. This admission on the part of the
physician caused a ripple of laughter to
pass over the audience.
The day before Martin Bowers died Dr.
McLaughlin went to the house and saw
that the patient was In a state of utter
collapso. and vomiting terribly. Harry
Bowers was then told that if hia brother
was not removed to some place where
he would receive more care he would not
last long. The bridge builder was re
moved to the German Hospital next day.
but too late. The doctor explained that
the symptoms of various kinds of pois
oning are very much the same. Â¦ p
Dr. John Lncan testified that he was
called to the, Bowers house on the even
ing of August 13. After two visits he
found that the patient was taking medi
cines prescribed by another man and
withdrew from the case; He thought
Bowers, might have been suffering from
arsenical poisoning.
Dr. Bernstein, resident physician at the
German Hospital, said that. Bowers was
taken to the institution in an ambulance
on August 25 in a dying condition. Re
storatives were applied and the' man sur
vived until about 4 o'clock In the after
noon.

The suit was commenced in 1S!M, the clty
clalming that the realty in question was
school property because on the Van Ness
map, adopted by the city in 1S54, it was
designated by brown coloring, showing
that it had been reserved for public pur
poses.
Seawell holds that the mere fact that
the lot was colored brown on the map,
without any evidence as to the number of
lots .so colored. Is not sufficient to Jus
tify the inference that it was reserved
for school purposes, particularly as there
is nothing in the report of the commis
sioners who selected the lots to show that
any of the lots reserved were designated
by color. The map itself was poor evi
dence, as it is faded.
In a decision rendered yesterday in the
city's suit to quiet title to a piece of
realty brought against Judge John Hunt,
as executor of the estate of the late
George F. Sharp. Judge Seawell decided
that title vested in Hunt in his capacity
as executor. The property is located at
the corner of Fillmore and Thirteenth
streets and was claimed by the city on
the ground that It had been reserved un
der the Van Ness ordinance for school
purposes.

Notwithstanding the Information that
comes from Reno, It Is not believed at
the Governor's office here that the Ne
vada authorities will insist upon the re
â¢vvards being paid before turning the es
reped convicts over to the California of
i":Â« -ers. Private Secretary Nye will com
municate with the Governor's office " at
Carson City, New, to learn the exact
condition of affairs, and if no obstacles
are put in the way of the desire of the
Governor's office here to have Murphy
p.n<i Woods returned to Folsom the prison
ers will shortly again be Inmates of th?t
institution.
It has been intimated that the Nevada
authorities would not deliver up to the
agent of the State of California the two
. prisoners unless the reward of $550 offered
Â¦ for the capture of each of the two con
victs was paid in advance. This is some
â¢Â¦wkat embarrassing, as there are no
â¢ means for meeting the demands of the
"Nevada authorities in the event that such
demands are made. It would bo neces
sary for the State Board of Examiners to
audit the claims of the captors of Mur

APPLIZS FOB REQUISITIONS.
In the light of developments the phy
sician said that there could be absolutely
no doubt that Martin Bowers waÂ« suf
fering from arsenical poisoning while at
the Waldeck. Mrs. Bowers said after
a month that they could not stand the
expense of keeping the patient at the
sanitarium and her husband was then re
moved home. Previous to leaving the
Waldeck hn had been able to be in the
garden and was feeling well.
. After being transferred home he became
rapidly worse. The physician was sure
that the sick man was not getting proper
attention, and so stated to the Bowers
family and to some of their visitors. Dr.
McLaughlin went away to the country
about the first of August, as he did not
understand what Mrs. Bowers wanted to
have him do about treating the patient
further in view of what had been said.
When be returned he sent his assistant
around to 370 Clementina street to find
out how he stood with the Bowers fam-
SAYS ARSENIC WAS CAUSE,
Dr. McLaughlin noticed the drooping of
wrists and ankles and the partial paraly
sis, which are symptoms of mineral poi
soning. He asked Bowers if he had been
in the mines or around any place where
there was fresh paint, and concluded
when assured that there could not be
any mineral poisoning that ptomaines
had caused the trouble.
Dr. McLaughlin first saw Martin Bow
ers on July 4 or 5. The bridge-builder
was emaciated and very weak. His symp
toms were those of poisoning. The phy
sician pave the man a treatment which
wou'.d benefit a sufferer from any kind
of poisoning, and the patient began to
recover rapidly.

July and told him about a sick friend
who had been under the care of two doc
tors and who had not benefited thereby.
Cunningham wanted the physician to
take the case, and on the advice of- the
latter Bowers was shortly taken to the
Waldeck Sanitarium.
Dr. McLaufrhlin, who was called next,
said that John Cunningham, whom he
had treated professionally about a year
Dr. Dillon next testified that he had
known Bowers for ten or twelve years.
On June 10 or 11 he was summoned to 370
Clementina street to see the sick bridge
builder. He found the man dressed, but
very weak and lying on the bed. The
physician did not think the patient had
been poisoned by ham. but diagnosed the
case as one of indigestion. He prescribed
a combination of bismuth and morphine.
He went to the Bowers home again on
June 13, and the patient was feeling bet
ter. Mrs. Bowers showed much affection
for her husband on this occasion. The
physician noticed two or three women In
the house, but no men. He did not think
that Bowers could have been suffering
violently at that time from arsenical poi
son in S-
CALLS CASE INDIGESTION.
The physician took a sample of the
matter which the sick man was vomiting
and examined it microscopically at his
home for ptomaines. Coroner Leland then
elicited the information that Dr. von
Tiedemann did not expect, to find any
ptomaines, and that they could not be
discovered by a microscope. The witness
paid that ptomaines were bacilli, which
was denied by other physicians who gave
testimony subsequently.
Dr. von Tiedemann was informed daily
in regard to the condition of Bowers, but
did not call again until June 9, when the
patient v.as reported to have improved.
Mrs. Bowers told the doctor then that
she had been sick for two days from eat
ing ham, but she showed no symptoms of
it. He requested her to keep him in
formed about her husband, but she failed
to do so. When he was leaving she said
his fee of $4 was too great.
He taw Cunningham In an adjacent
room on one of his visits. He knew no
more of the case until he heard that
murder had been committed. Dr. von
Tiedemann thought that Bowers might
have been suffering from arsenical poi
soning.
After the Jury had been formally sworn
Dr. Carl von Tiedemann was called upon
to set forth his knov.ledgo of the case. He
paid that he had been summoned to the
Bowers house about June 5. He found
the patient suffering from what he judged
was> ptomaine poisoning, in view of the
statements of Mrs. Bowers that her hus
band had become ill after partaking of
some ham. Bowers* symptoms were a
raging thirst, high temperature, dilated
pupils and an inability to keep food on
his stomach.
Mrs. Martha Bowers and Mrs. Sutton
were present with their attorneys, but
neither took the stand. Lervey, the third
prisoner, was kept in his cell at the City
Prlson. Mrs. Martha Bowers sighed deep
ly whenever any particularly damaging
evidence was introduced, but her sister,
Mrs. Suttcn, remained cold and calm as
the storied sphinx throughout the entire
proceedings. At times the audience was
Etill as death Itself while terrible truths
were being made known, and again the
lugubrious surroundings were forgotten
in hearty peals of laughter.
PHYSICIANS TESTIFY.
The evidence introduced at the inquest,
held yesterday, went to show only how
the murdered man came to his death.
There was no testimony in regard to the
motive for the crime. The session lasted
exactly six hours, exclusive of an Inter
mission for luncheon. The inquest room
was packed with witnesses and disinter

The first tunnel to drain tho mines of the
district to a marked extent was the Moffat,
driven Into Gold Hill. The amount of water
flowing from this tunnel reached as high as
3000 gallons per minute. The Standard tunnel
was driven about 200 feet lower, which com
pletely drained the Moffat tunnel. .The present
tunnel, driven in the common interest of all
the mines In that vicinity, is called the Crip
ple Creek drainage tunnel. The Bite for a sec
ond syndicate tunnel has not yet been selected.
Upon the success of this enterprise depends
the driving of a second drainage tunnel at a
lower level. Should this latter project be un
dertaken it will doubtless be well under way
before the reserves made available by the pres
ent tunnel are worked out. - > . .
Prior to the beginning of the tunnel an es
timate was made for tho Elkton Company of
the amount of coming: water in the Elkton and
other mines of tho vicinity, with a view to de
termining the advisability of continuing pump
ing operations, r Investigations were made
covering a period of several weeks, and these
showed that the quantity of water varied from
a minimum of 40.000.000 gallons to 170,000 0OO
gallons dally, and It was concluded that it
would be far cheaper to drive a long drainage
tunnel than to undertake to drain the area by
pumping to the depth the tunnel could reach.
With the exception of the small uncompleted
section which remained a few days ago. the
tunnel is in about B230 feet, which Includes
that portion of tUe^ El Paso workings on the
line of the tunnel. .A large amount of work
has been accomplished from the El Paso shaft,
and two other shafts were sunk on the tunnel
line to facilitate the work. If the tunnel bÂ«
continued under the Raven and Globe hills. Its
length will exceed 12.000 feet, or about two
and a half miles, without counting lateral
branches.
The Mining and Scientific Press pub
lishes some general facts of Interest
about the, great tunnel to drain the Crip
ple Creek mines that throw new light on
the large enterprise and what Is hoped
from- It. The several companies operating
in the district subscribed $80,000 In total
for the work, which was equal to the es
timated cost. Work on the tunnel was
begun January 25 of the present. year.
The lever of the tunnel Is '-230 feet below
the Standard tunnel. The Press says:
The Pacific Coast Borax Company Is
building a road from Ivanpah, San Ber
nardino County, to Aeh Meadows to reach
the borax deposits owned by the company
near Death Valley.,
The Iron Mountain Copper Company
has decided to use oil Instead of wood as
fuel In operating its railroad, which ex
tends from the smelters to the top of Iron
Mountain. Four years ago the Mountain
Copper Company was consuming 20,000
cords of wood per annum. The use of
wood as fuel is now ended at Keswlck.
This change has been brought about by the
substitution of electrical power, furnished
by the Northern California Power Com
pany, for steam; by the use of oil Instead
of wood in the hot air blast and at the
power-houses, and the abandonment of
the open-air^ system of roasting ores,
which alone consumed several thousand
cords of wood every year.

PEKING, Sept 4.â The severe wounds
inflicted Upon two Americans yesterday
by French soldiers has created general
indignation against tho policy of the
German and French commanders in or
dering their soldiers to carry Bide arms
while off duty.
After the German-Austrian affray last
May all of the foreign commanders
agreed to prohibit tho carrying of side
arms while the men were outside of the
posts. This agreement, however, was
overruled by the German general, and
the soldiers of the Kaiser were again or
dered to wear their weapons, and their
example was followed by the French. All
of the other foreign soldiers travel about
unarmed.
The French and German privates while
drunk are a menace to everybody. Wit
nesses to the affair of yesterday declare
that the French were clearly the ag
gressors. The French commander treats
the matter lightly, but a strong request
for the punishment of the guilty parties
has been made by Captain Andre Brew
ster, military attache of the American
legation.

CRIPPLE CREEK, Sept 4.â The Board
of Commissioners of Teller County to-day
adopted resolutions denouncing the action
of Goveror Peabody In sending troops 1 to
the Cripple Creek district^ The resolu
tions declare that there la no need for
troops here and that their presence will
do more harm than good. The belief 13
expressed that the investigation made by
the Governor's commission was not made
in ?ood faith.
Sheriff Robertson this afternoon made
public a statement In which he protests
against the Governor's action, declaring
it a usurpation of authority and a vio-Â»
latlon of law. '
A part of the troops in charge of Ad
jutant General Bell left Denver over the
Denver and Rio Grande for Cripple Creek
at 4 o'clock. It -was the Intention to take
the Cripple Creek Short Line from Colo
rado Springs to Cripple Creek, but at
the former place General Bell was in
formed that about thirty strikers left
Cripple Creek soon after it was learned
that the troops were coming by the Short
LJne. They followed the line of that
road, and although they were ostensibly
on a fishing trip, It was feared that they
Intended to blow up the track or other
wise interfere with tho progress of the
troops, and the plans were changed and
the soldiers forwarded over the Midland
Terminal.
At â¢ 10 o'clock Governor Peabody re
ceived a message from General Bell at
Colorado Springs, where he had been de
layed by a change in transportation plans,
saying that he was advised by Lieuten
ant Whann, commanding the Cripple
Creek militia company, that the condi
tions were becoming threatening and was
urged to hasten the movement of the
troops.
calling out the militia. No violence has
been reported at Cripple Creek since
Tuesday night, when one non-union car
penter and a justice were assaulted by
unknown persons.
President Charles . H. Moyer of the
Western Federation of Miners has ad
dressed a letter to Governor Peabody, In
which he declares that the conditions in
the Cripple Creek district are not such as
to warrant the calling out of troops. He
declares that such an act by the Gov
ernor at this time is a violation of the
law under which the executive Is empow
ered to call out troops.
President Moyer says that the members
of the federation in the Cripple Creek
district will help to maintain order.
Governor Peabody made the following
statement regarding his action In calling
out the troops:
I have tried to act with prudence. Tho gen
tlemen who went to Cripple Creek at my re
quest to investigate conditions advised ma
that the situation was such that troops ought
to be ordered out.
Sheriff Robertson has maintained the posi
tion that he took when the matter was first
suggested and he did not Join in tho request
for troops. I had hoped that the necessity for
calling out troops would be avoided and final
action was delayed as long as was consistent
with the proper protection of the lives and
property of the people of tho Cripple Creek
district, judging from reports of conditions
there.
The reports of the Governor's commis
sion was as follows:
Having visited Cripple Creek and Victor,
and after careful inquiry among representative
citizens and property owners, including the
Mayors of Cripple Creek and Victor, wo are
of the opinion that the lives of citizens of
the district are in Imminent danger and prop
erty and personal rights are in Jeopardy.
Prompt action is imperatively demanded by the
above people to protect tho lives and property
of the citizens. WÂ» find that a reign of terror
exists in the district which should be relieved
at once. We do not believe that, the civil au
thorities are able to cope with jhe situation.

What gave rise to belief In certain minds
that the crosscut was on the wrong track was
the decidedly broken formation encountered.
Three distinct faults were struck in the course
of the work, but the upraise followed them
steadily and the outcome shows for Itself.
To add to the great difficulty encountered, Mr.
Brockington had no reliable maps of the un
derground workings of , the old Houston Hill,
which had not been operated since the latter
sixties. This made it uncertain to estimate
distances, which in a measure accounts for the
time required In the work.
Yesterday the machine drill penetrated the
lower works of the Houston Hill at what Is es
timated as the 400 level, and a volume of wa
ter was encountered, which was not wholly un
expected. This Is quickly draining off and in a
few days Mr. Brockington hopes to be able
to enter the scene of the strike and ascertain
exactly what is in sight and what course of ac-
Tho Grass Valley Union tells a story of
pluck that is characteristic of California
miners. Three years and flve months ago
Charles Brocklngton, for the Orleans
Mining Company, started the long cross
cut that .has finally led; to the .Houston
HH1 works In the lower levels, long since
submerged. When the work was begun
it was supposed that it would be com
pleted in elx months. The formation
proved so hard . that the progress was
slow.. The. crosscut was started from un
der the Madison Hill ledge, and was re
garded by many miners as a foolish en
terprise. Brocklngton pegged away, how
ever, keeping his own counsel, and has
met with the object of his search.
CALIFORNIA PLUCK.
The population of Sierra County Is
estimated at 4500. " The mineral produc
tion in 1901 was $576,182. The area is about
1000 square miles, practically all of which
with the exception of Sierra Valley is
mountainous.
The main ridge of the Sierra Nevadas cresses
the eastern part of the county from south to
north. Several spurs from the main ridge trav
erse the county from east to west, forming the
watersheds of the four principal streams, which
fftrm the drainage system of the western part.
These streams consist of the Middle Yuba River
on the south, with Wolf Creek, Kanaka Creek
and Oregon Creek as tributaries; the North
-Yuba near the center,- with the North Fork,
South Fork. Middle Fork and East Branch ad-
Joining It near Downleville. and Canyon Creek
and Slate Creek on the north. Sierra County is
bounded on the south by the mining county of
Nevada, on the east by the State of Nevada,
on the north by the mining county of Plumas,
and on the west by the mining portion of Yuba
County. ;;Â¦-â¢*â¢
Nearly all of the ridges of this county
above an â¢ elevation of 4500 feet are lava
tapped. - It is in .these ridges where -the drift
mines He. â¢ Many of- 1 these ridges have never
been prospected. Unlimited watÂ«r power is
available at all points. The abundant rain and
snow fall furnishes an ample supply of water,
which the. precipitous nature of the country
renders available under any pressure desired,
with a reasonable length of ditch. Almost
the entire county is covered with the finest
pine, spruce, fir and sugar pine timber. While
gold Is the principal product of the mining
section of the county, there are many valu
able ' deposits of iron and copper. Lack of
transportation facilities has retarded the de
velopment of these mineral deposits.
Since 1849, when the county was first set
tled, the principal industry has been gold
mining, and many millions of dollars have
been taken from its river beds, gravel deposits
and quartz veins. The quartz belt crossing
the country U "twenty miles in width,' with a
trend to the northwest. This belt consists of
eeveral distinct zones, distinguishable by the
character of the ore and the nature of the
Vountry rock. The most notable of these
zones passes through the central portion of
the county, near Sierra City, and runs north
westerly through the Gold Lake region to and
beyond the famous Plumas-Eureka mine, Just
across the Plumas County line. The quartz
veins of , this zone are situated ' witWn and
alone each side of a belt of Quartz porphyry
about one mile . wide. These veins generally
have a northwest strike and a dip of about
fifty degrees to the northeast. Two miles east
of this zone is another, on the contact be
tween the slate* of the west and the granite
on the east. Most of this contact, however, is
covered with gravel deposits. A third zone
crosses the county in a northwesterly direc
tion, between Downlevllle and Sierra City.
This zone is ten miles in width and consists
of alternate bands of clay slates, quartzite and
porphpyry. The ledges occur within the slates
or between the slates and quartzite or slate
and porphyry. West of this zone is a band
of serpentine passing through Forest City,
Goodyear Bar and Poker Flat. Most of the
discoveries on this serpentine contact have
been made :by drift miners working under tho
lava-capped ridges, but many valuable discov
eries have been made in the neighborhood of
Alleghany, where Kanaka Creek has cut a
deep channel through the country, exposing
the contact.
Some new light is thrown on the min
eral resources of Sierra County by a bul
letin Just issued by the State Mining Bu
reau, together with a map which care
fully locates every mining claim in the
county and defines the means of access
to all parts of the county. This sums
up some of the leading facts concerning
Sierra as follows:
IN SIEBBA COUNTY.
A company beaded by Ed Mallows of Keo
wlck has been busy buying these rights and
making: preparations for the work of mining
by the drift process. It is the intention of
the company to commence operations some
distance from the town and easily work* their
way up excavating: the rich gravel as they
proceed. They are of the opinion that by the
time they reach the town they will be far
enough below the surface to remove all fear
of danger to the buildings. They expect to ba
handsomely compensated for their enterprise
and outlay.*
The town of Dutch Flat Is to be under
mined to get the gold that lies under It.
The enterprise Is based on the idea that
the rich gravel channels In that district
run under the. town- The channel had
proved to be rich when It was worked by
the hydraulic process. "When the hy
draullo mining Industry received so se
vere a set-back through the famous court
decision of a Federal tribunal Dutch Flat
suffered. Concerning the plans for tun
neling the Nevada County Miner says:
When the matter was first broached to the
property owners they demurred. They, sur
mised that the damage to the town would be
greater than the benefit to be derived from
such an enterprise. But when thÂ«y were In
formed that the work could be done without
any Injury to the city they consented and will
ingly sold the mineral rights to their prop
erty. . .

As is verv frequently found the stomach
trouble and headache in the following case
â¢came from the same cause. Dr. Miles Anti-
Pain Pills, like all of Dr. Miles' Remedies,
are designed to cure the disease, not the
t jrrsptorr.s. This readily explains why these
6trri:r.Â£ medicines can cure such a variety of
diseases. There is no remedy, formula or
prescription which in any way equals Dr.
Miles' Anti-Paia Pills for the speedy cure
&nd relief of headache and kindred ailments.
"Up to the age of twenty -three xny son was
greatly troubled wilh severe pains in the
fctomach. After he had served his term of
enlistment with the army in the Philippines
he came home and was cnÂ£t for anything
because of terrible headaches. He found
that Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills not only re-
lieved him of the headaches but would pre-
vent an attack if taken in time. He contin-
ued their use for some time and to his sur-
prise and delight he found they had cured
the stomach trouble also. You mav imagine
how grateful both he and mvself feel to. you
for the good the Anti-Pain Tills have done

Go East With Us
and Save Money
The difference in the cost of a first-class and a second-class ticket from Calif ornia to the .East is usnally
from $10 to $12. The holder of a first-class ticket may take a berth in a standard sleep mg car at a i cost
of $14 to Chicago or $13 to St. Louis, while the holder of a second-class ticket can get a similar berth,
comfortably holding two people, in a tourist sleeping car for only $6.
The difference might as well remain in your pocket, for you sacrifice nothing in comfort Â«Â«ravcn|Â«Qce.
The bed linen and blankets in the tourist car are just as good, the porters jost as attentive and obliging
-if not more so, and if you go our way you have the added convenience of being in the care oi a special |
tourist conductor, who does so much to make the trip interesting and entertaining.
"We take you through Salt Lake City, Colorado by daylight, and Denver, and one party each week is so

occupied by Smith and O'Brien In the
hope of discovering some of the watches

Seventh and Natoma streets, and his

Henry Elmers, the grocer at 1345 Sac

! Elmers had a look at the two sus

j admitting that he thought Smith was
one of the robbers, his conscience would

Elmers said he was satisfied that
' Smith was the footpad not only from the

Pasco, a fellow employe of Brady,
made affidavit that he once saw Allen,
wiio roomed at the home of the Bradys,
with his arm around Mrs. Brady's waist
and with Ills head so close to hers that
he formed the conclusion that they had
been kissing each other.

ing her photographs taken in rtrange

than G. & Moore, her husband, is will-
Ing to put up with. Judge Graham
heard his suit for divorce and granted
Mm his freedom. Moore said he was a
religious man and the actions of his
wife so affected him that he became sick
in mind and body and in danger of ner
vous prostration. He also said that
Mrs. Moore woutd smoke cigarettes
â¢just to be toughV and that she was
slÂ«o very extravagant. He said the only
satisfaction he got when he remonstra
ted with her was to be told "to come off
hi* perch." The Moores live at 708 Oc

Judge Hebbard also granted a decree
of divorce to Ada L. Pratt froni Charles
I.. Pratt, a well-known young man who
recently <ame into prominence because
Â« f his trial by the Civil Service Commis
sioners on a charge of loafing in the of
fice of Registrar Walsh, where he was
an employe. As a result of the trial he
Â»a? suspended for thirty days. Pratt
was shown to be a wife beater by the
testimony t of his wife and several of
>**r relatives. ShÂ« testified that in Au
pust. 11*02. just nine months after her
marriage to Pratt, he commenced abus

February of this year, when they were

brutally choked her. causing her to be

offered in the case with the exception of

1R?5 and that in February. 1901. her
husband deserted h^r. throwing her
on the charity of relatives and friends
for the support of herself and her two

promptly awarded her a decree.

was effectually proved in Judge Hob

divorce was awarded Mrs. Johnston. She

children, a boy and a pirl, and the

the late J. Ross Ja<-kson. clubman and
The depositions of Joseph J. White and
B. George White were read by the de
fense to prove that Mrs. Jennie White
had knowledge of the divorce proceed
ings. Joseph J. White testified he was a
brother of Jonathan L. White, and lived
with his mother, Mrs. Maria White, who
is now dead. He said he knew the plain
tiff by the name of Jennie White; that
he learned of the marriage from his
mother in the latter part of 1SS3.
SWEARS SHE READ SUMMONS.
He swears that Mrs. White read the
contents of the summons In the divorce
case to himself and his mother. "After
reading the papers," he testified, "she
said she expected Lloyd would ask for a
divorce, as she would never be contented
In San Francisco. She said her husband
was a seafaring man and was in the habit
of traveling. She told my mother In my
presence that she did not care if she was
divorced from Lloyd, that she had plenty
of money in bank in New York and had
made her living long before she met
Lloyd White."
In his deposition Benjamin George
White of Bath Beach; N. Y., testified that
In the winter of 1SS4 Mrs. Jennie White
told, him while out sleighriding with him
that she was no longer his sister-in-law,
as Lloyd had secured a divorce from her.
Richard H. Morrison was then called to
the stand, and his testimony surprised
the attroneys for the plaintiff. Judge
Aitken cross-examined Morrison at great
length, but was unable to shake his state
ments. When the hour of adjournment
arrived the witness was still being inter
rogated. The case will be taken up again
next Thursday morning.
George E. Goeller of 737 East One Hun
rded and Thirty-seventh street. New
York, testified before the Commissioner
that he was a clerk in the Marshal's of
fice. He said he was familiar with the
handwriting of Charles Koleman. the
man who is alleged to have served the
process on Mrs. White In the divorce pro
ceedings. He said the signature to the
affidavit was Koleman's.
George Scheer of 22 West One Hundred
and Thirty-sixth street. New York, testi
fied that he was a half-brother of the
late Charles Koleman. He said his broth
er died at the Manhattan Hospital, on
Wards Island, on October 18, 1S93. He
said he was thrown from a Third avenue
car and died from the effects of the fall.
He said he was familiar with Koleman's
handwriting and swore the signature to
the affidavit was his.
Judge Aitken introduced the register of
actions in order to get the record of the
divorce case in evidence, and then rested
his case. The defense opened its case by
attempting to introduce four depositions
taken before a Commissioner in New
York. Objection was made to their intro
duction, and quite a legal argument en
sued. Judge Troutt finally allowed them
to be read and the afternoon was de
voted to their reading and to heated
squabbles between the attorneys on both
sides.
DEPOSITIONS ARE BEAD.
When the case was called yesterday
morning Mrs. White was placed on the
stand to correct some testimony given
at a previous hearing. Miss Birdie Fen
nell was called to the witness stand and
told that she knew Mrs. Jennie Whlto
and hart met her when she was living
at the Russ House. This testimony was
to corroborate the statement of the plain
tiff that she had roomed at the hotel
during her visit to this city after the
year 18S4. The witness was not permitted
to narrate any declarations made to her
at the time by Mrs. White.
Morrison is one of the executors of the
estate. He lives in New York City, and
came to this city to give testimony. He
is related to the late Jonathan Lloyd
White by marriage, having married a
sister of the capitalist. According to the
testimony given by him on the witness
stand yesterday, he accompanied Mr.
White to a lawyer's office, where he met
Mrs. Jennie White. This was on April
26, 1S9.">. He said that he saw Mr. White
turn ovpr to his wife $1250 in bills and
she affixed her signature to . the receipt
which was drawn up by . an attorney.
The paper was offered in evidence and
shows that Mrs. White acknowledges the
receipt "of $1250 from Jonathan Lloyd
White? her divorced husband." Morrison
testified that after the paper had been
signed he affixed his signature to the pa
per, and had it acknowledged before a
notary public.
The signature to the document Is writ
ten in a shaky hand;, Mrs. White denies
ever singing such a paper. -She admits
having received $1200 from her husband
about the year named, but signed a small
piece of paper which was a receipt for
the amount.
The plaintiff will be placed on the wit
ness stand to deny the testimony given
by Morrison, who is the defendants' star
witness. She could hardly restrain her
self yesterday afternoon. After court ad
journed she told her attorneys that Mor
rison had sworn to an untruth and that
the document was a forgery.
CLAIMS HE SAW MONEY PAID.
The attorneys for the heirs and-execu
tors of the estate of the late Jonathan
Lloyd White sprung a surprise on the
plaintiff. Mrs. Jennie White, yesterday.
It was In the nature of a receipt alleged
to have been signed by Mrs. "White in
1S95, and Richard H. Morrison, who claims
he witnessed the signing and paying over
of the money, was In court to testify to
its genuineness.
In her effort to have a decree of divorce
set aside on the ground of fraud Mrs.
White has all along contended that she
did not know that a divorce had been
granted her husband until some years
after his death. If the divorce was se
cured by fraud Mrs. White is entitled
to half the estate left by Jonathan Lloyd
White. As the estate is valued at $100,000
both sides are making strenuous efforts
to secure a victory. ,

Pinkham for advice ; all 'such letters are
strictly confidential ; she has guided in a
motherly way hundreds of young women ;
and her advice is freely and cheerfully given.
School days are danger days for American girls.
Often physical collapse follows, and it takes years to recover th*
lost vitality. Sometimes it is never recovered.
Perhaps they are not over-careful about keeping their feet drr;
through carelessness in this respect the monthly sickness is usually
rendered very severe.
Then begin ailments which should be removed at once, or they will
produce constant suffering. Headache, faintness, slight vertigo, pains
m the back and loins, irregularity, loss of sleep and appetite, a tendency
to avoid the sociaty of others, are symptoms all indicating that woman's
arch-eneiay is at hand.
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound has helped many a
young girl over this critical period. "With it they have gone through
their trials with courage and safety. With its proper use the young
girl is safe from the peculiar dangers of school years and prepared for
hearty womanhood.
A Young Chicago Girl "Studied Too Hard."
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â I wish to thank you for the help and benÂ«
efit I have received through the use of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound and Liver Pills. When I was about seventeen
years 'old I suddenly seemed to lose my usual good
't^^^^^^^^^^K nea * tn anf l vitality. Father said I studied too
f^Â»^^^^^^^^^^^k_^ hard, but the doctor thought different and
prescribed tonics, which I took by the
Hi^^^^^^^^^^^M^ quart without relief. Keading one day in
wi^^^^^^^^^^ the paper of 31rs. Pinkham's great cures,
â¢ql and finding the symptoms described an-
) S:^^^^^^M^^Mx STVere^ m i n^ I decided I would give Lydia
/ p i n klÂ»am*s Vegetable Compound tÂ»
f L_. a^- I did not say a word to the doctor ;
lQ$i bÂ° n ohk it myself, and took it according
ts&llL to di rect iÂ° ns "regularly for two months,
and I found that I gradually improved,
0*1^ an^ that all pains left me, and I was my
: X^f'yr ry// / old self once more. â Lillie E. Si:n*c:lalr,

"Deak Mrs. Pinkiiam: â I feel it my duty to tell all young -women
how much Lydia E. Pinkham's wonderful Vegetable Compound has
done for roe. I was completely run down, unable to attend school, and
did not care for any kind of society, but now I feel like a new person,
and have gained seven pounds of flesh in three months.

SECRETARY SHAW has confirmed the report
given out from Washington some time ago
t!:at he has accumulated in the treasury the
.mii:i of $40,000,000 as a surplus of which he can avail
iftimsdf to meet any stringency which may occur in
the money market during the crop moving season.
The fact that he has such an accumulation adds in
terest to his statement at the Merchants' and Travel
ers' banquet in Chicago on Wednesday that one of
the most urgent needs of the country is the enact
ment of legislation which will give to our currency
the element of elasticity a'nd thus put an end to the
.necessity of using public money for the relief of
private banking.
The object of the accumulation is the avoidance of
t;ny such stringency of money as occurred last year,
when the Secretary was forced to go several times to
the relief of the money market for the purpose of
preventing a situation that might have caused a
.panic. He was severely criticized for his action at
the time and it appears that this year he resolved to
try a new means of meeting any emergency that
might arise, and accordingly set about storing up a
.surplus of public money which would be available
.lor deposit in banks whenever he chose.
Under the laws all receipts from customs duties
must be deposited in the treasury arid can be paid
.out only for appropriations made by Congress or for
current expenses of the Government. Receipts from
internal revenue are, however, available for all pur
poses for which the Secretary of the Treasury draws
"warrants. Last year the Secretary had the internal
revenue receipts deposited in national banks where
"they were available for general circulation. It is
said the effect, while beneficial to the extent that it
kept that much monej* in the channels of trade in
stead of locking it up in the treasury, was not wholly
Satisfactory; and it is for that reason the Secretary
.has this year stored up the receipts instead of de
positing them. With the sum now at command the
Secretary can effectually prevent the occurrence of
anything like a stringency at any time.
: A. statement of the situation given out at the time
of the first report of the accumulation of the surplus
-presented the plan in this way: "The available cash
; balance o? the treasury is in round numbers $230,
.000.000. of which $144,000,000 is deposited in the banks
.â¢to the credit of the Treasurer, and some $10,000,000
consists of silver bullion and small coin, leaving $76,
,000.000 which may actually be used. As the average
"working balance supposed to be convenient for the
â¢treasury is $50,000,000, it will be seen that the
.$40,000,000 'relief fund would probably be used, if at
aH, only for a short time and in a manner to leave
it at the immediate disposal of the Secretary. Still,
with the present overflowing condition of the treas
ury,; he could undoubtedly carry out any plan that
he might consider requisite for the prevention of
acute disturbance."
' We may therefore assume that the situation for
â¢this year is saved. It is quite certain, however, that
.the new plan will be subject to as much criticism
as was that adopted last year, nor will the criticism
;be necessarily unfounded. The Secretary has done
..what is perhaps best under the circumstances, but
the circumstances are bad. It is not fitting that the
national treasury should be a part of the banking
â¢ >ystem of the country. Having $40,000,000 available
tor deposit it is certain that the Secretary will be
"importuned by many banks for a portion at least
â¢of the fund; and while there will be no cause for
"scandal on this any more than on former occasions
of making deposits of public money in various banks,
still the system is bad. Secretary Shaw himself rec
ognizes the evil and has repeatedly declared him
' self in favor of a reform.
Reports from the East are somewhat discouraging
for the advocates of the desired legislation, for it is
;said there is a strong opposition on the part of many
Congressmen to undertake any kind of currency legis
lation this winter. Perhaps the situation as revealed
â¢by the Secretary of the Treasury may change their
minds. At any rate it will confirm business men in
thrir conviction that an clastic currency is badly
needed and should be provided at once.
THE CURRENCY QUESTION
A Chinese reform editor, doomed to deat\ wrote
recently. his own, valedictory in alleged verse. This
is one of the cases where our sympathetic humanity

They seem born to the strenuous life in Ar
kansas. Their words breathe it and their actions
fulfill it. The Governor and a Supreme Justice of
the State spoke from the same platform the other
day. They disagreed and the Justice promptly
knocked the Governor off the speaker's stand.
There is nothing like a sound argument soundly
applied.
MR. BRYAN is a peculiar person. His preten
â¢ions excite merriment, but they are asserted
oy him with such a solemn air that they also

A reviewer in describing the changes by which the
tonnage of competing yachts has diminished while
the sail area has been enormously increased, says:
"These staggering changes have become possible by
the adoption of the fin keel. The displacement of the
Columbia, for instance, is 145 tons, and ninety tons
of this weight is in the lead bulb carried twenty feet
under her water line. Ninety tons is practically the
weight of the average locomotive and its tender.
Imagine a boat but ninety feet long and twenty-four
feet beam carrying a 90-ton locomotive suspended
twenty feet below her underbody and the enormous
stability of the racing machine is explained. But a
boat of 145 tons, whereof ninety tons are in her keel,
has not much capacity left over for carrying her
crew and their creature comforts; she is a yacht by
courtesy only, and not a vessel that can cruise or
make a voyage." '
The limit of the racing machine has not yet been
reached and if the competition in that direction go
further we shall doubtless see something still more
wonderful in the way of a racing craft fitted for light
winds, but useless for anything else. Still it now
seems evident that a majority of yachtsmen, at any
rate, have no desire to see further successes in that
line. The demand for a genuine yacht race for the
cup is becoming formidable and may be strong
enough to bring about some change in the terms
when the next challenger comes forward.
SIR THOMAS LIPTON declared before the
late series of races began that if he won the
America's cup he would fix the terms of compe
tition in such a manner that the contests would be
made by genuine yachts and not by racing machines.
In developing his views he said: "Racisg machines
are dangerous and useless. If Shamrock III loses
I shall have to throw her upon a scrap heap. If she
wins never will her type of boat race again for the
America's cup unless the cup again should leave its
native shores for the United States."
The implication in that statement that Americans
are rrio're devoted to racing machines than to genu
ine yachts is hardly fair. Since first the public be
gan to get warmed up to an interest in the rivalry
between Shamrock III and the Reliance the press
of the East, which certainly fairly reflects the senti
ment of the 'people, has been well nigh unanimous
in deprecating the racing. machine and calling for a
revival of racing between genuinely good yachts.
Long before Lipton made any public utterance on
the subject some of the leading papers of New
York, Boston and Philadelphia had earnestly urged
the adoption of a new set of regulations governing
future contests so that hereafter the emulation and
rivalry for the cup would tend to improve yachts
instead of wasting energy in the construction of a
machine fit for nothing but racing in light winds,
i] The only dissenting voice that has been heard is
that of a contemporary that argues in defense of the
racing machine that it serves the same purpose as
a light sulky made for trotting races. "The man
who drives Lou Dillon to a two-minute mile," says
this authority, "does not feel that the sport of trot
ting demands that he should drive her to a vehicle
that can be used as an express wagon between heats."
The argument is ingenious, but there is no analogy
between the two things. The trotting race is main
tained not to improve sulkies, but to improve horses.
If there were devised^ style of racing that did not
improve the breed of horses and thus increase the
efficiency of that animal both for work and for pleas
ure, it is safe to say the public would not long,sanc
tion it. The object of yacht racing should b'e the
improvement of yachts, and since the construction of
the machine type does not act as an incentive to any
genuine yacht improvement, the present outburst of
condemnation of that kind of racing is quite jus
tifiable. '

cows seem partial to explosives as an

eat. Common gunpowder is relished just
as much as dynamite sticks. Last year
one of Bob Radcliff's cows at Baird
topped off an 'evening meal by swallow
ing a couple of sticks of giant powder.
The cow strolled around calmly and se
renely for a couple of days thereafter,
causing the people in her neighborhood
a great amount of anxiety. In fact the
residents near Baird fled whenever the
cow put In an appearance. A few days
later there was a terrific explosion in
Radcliff's pasture and pieces of dead
cow, were found scattered in every di

So, an analysis of the platform nullifies the motto

shall not be called "special."
pelled to pay for a convenience they cannot use, by

sition of the Geary street railroad is especially de

MAYOR SCHMITZ has been renominated
unanimously and enthusiastically by his party,
and is before the people again for re-election
to the office to which he was elected by a plurality in-
November two years ago.
The exclusive class of labor called union labor
is now fairly embarked in politics and locally has
crystallized into a political party, to be discussed, ex
amined, attacked, perhaps misrepresented and surely
criticized the same as any other political party. We
take occasion to commend the leaders of this new
party for its organization. It brings all the purposes
and practices of union labor into a position for ex
amination and comparison, and sends them to judg
ment on their merits.
The Mayor's platform is lengthy and is specific'in
parts and general in parts, as suits the purpose of
those who drew it and after the fashion of political
declarations. It declares the motto of the party to
be *'Equal rights for all and special privileges to
none." Does this party mean this? It is a principle
of our equal laws that the property which a man
has in his own labor, as it is the original founda
tion of all other property, is the most sacred and
inviolable. The property of a laboring man lies in
the strength and dexterity of his own hands. To
hinder him from employing this strength and dex
terity in what lawful manner he thinks proper is a
plain violation of this most sacred property, being
an encroachment upon the liberty of both the i work
man and of those disposed to employ him. It hin
ders the one from working at what he thinks proper
and the others from employing whom they think
proper. It is among the first principles and foun
dation of the common law that civil liberty, the great
end of all human society and government,, is that
state in which each individual has the power to pursue
his own happiness according to his own views of his
interests and the dictates of his conscience, unre
strained except by equal, just and impartial laws.
Does the Mayor's platform conform to tliese prin
ciples? Does his party concede to non-union labor
the rights claimed by its members for themselves?
Does it apply its declaration of equal rights to the
state of the non-union laborer who claims the right
of private contract and the right to work and sup
port his family without the license or permission of
any labor union? If the Mayor's party so interpret
its motto then ft is well chosen. If not it is as sound
ing brass and tinkling cymbal. The platform^is its
own interpretation in that respect, for it demands
that the taxpayers of the city be restricted in the
purchase of public supplies for which they pay to
goods bearing the union label. This is a direct de
nial of equal rights to the non-union laborer, who,
though a taxpayer himself, is denied the right to sell
the work of his hands to the city. The public sup
plies then arc declared to belong to union labor only
as a special privilege, and equal rights in furnishing
them are denied to non-union labor.
This is a fundamental question. It involves the
right of contract, which the courts hold to be a
property right and therefore inviolable. Cardinal
Gibbons says^ that the right of a non-union laborer
to make his own contract and perform it by bis labor
is the essence of liberty and should be defended by
the whole power of society. That is a genuine
declaration of equal rights. Does the Mayor sub
scribe to it, and will his party indorse it? When
the labor union claim of the power to license Ameri
can labor and to enforce its license by denying
to the non-union laborer the common rights of man
was merely the policy of confederated organizations
which had the physical power to enforce it and used
that power, the matter was dealt with as each case
of denial of private rights arose. When the same
purpose is made into a political platform it is sub
ject to discussion the same as any other political
proposition by any party.
One of the strange and almost weird statements
of the platform is this, in compliment to the Mayor:
"During his term of office all differences between
labor and capital, employer and employe, have been
adjusted satisfactorily to both sides and without vio
lence and bloodshed.".
Does this mean that if the labor union party is
kept in power it will give bonds that non-union
labor, though denied the right to work at all, shall
be permitted to wish to work without being mur
dered or maimed? Does it mean that the myriad
felonies against property that are being committed
by the striking linemen on the property of the tele
phone company are not considered to be the use of
violence? Does it mean that, having control of all
the means of enforcing the law which protects the
equal rights of man, the labor union party will "sat
isfy" non-union labor and employers and contractors
that wisdom lies in conceding all demands made upon
them?

The Ohio convention nominated a candidate for the
United States Senate against Mr. Hanna. The nom
inee is named Clark and his name was quite a stran
ger in the trump of Fame. It was suspected, too,
that Mr. . Clark had taken advantage of his obscurity
to think ill of some of the Bryan-Johnson issues in
politics. But he was nominated by a trade that
seems to have been necessary to defeat Zimmerman's
choice for Governor.
After it was done and the smoke of conflict cleared
its "place was taken by a cloud of suspicion of Clark's
orthodoxy. Who could pass upon that but Bryan?
He' was sent for. to look over Clark's past^ life and
conduct and walk and conversation, and now it is
gravely announced from Columbus that "Mr. Bryan
consents to Mr. Clark being a candidate for the
Senate," and peace settles upon the party in Ohio
as thickly as breakfast food mush on the morning
plate. Of course, if Mr. Bryan of Nebraska had
found against Clark the people of- Ohio would have
been denied the privilege of supporting him for
United States Senator. Clark, therefore, becomes the
representative of Mr. Bryan and the privilege of the
people is abridged and limited by the will of a man
who is not a citizen of their State! It is solemn,
it is spectacular, but it is funny.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
O^, THE PACIFIC COAST
When Russell Avery, a well-known man
about town, died two weeks ago It was
supposed that he died intesate. That he
died leaving no "will was stated in a peti
tion for letters of administration upon his
$20,000 estate. This was (lied a few days
after hia death by Francis Avery, his
father, a wealthy resident of Sausalito.
Yesterday, however, a will bearing the
signature of Avery was produced and of
fered for probate by Giacinta Cprslni
Avery, the divorced wife of the deceased,
and she filed a % petition' asking- that she
be appointed administratrix of the estate.
Under, tha will she is the sole legatee of
the estate of her late husband and she is
also named executrix. ' The document is
holographic and bears date of August 7,
1901. It was given into her possesston a
short time after it was made and she kept
its existence a secret until it was shown
to her that the law provides that any one
possessing a will of any deceased per
son must file it within thirty days after
death. Because of her divorce from the
deceased several months ago the will is
said to be of little value to her, but it is
evident that she intends to make a fight
for the property.
It Was Made Two Years Ago and
Has Been in Possession of
His Divorced Wife.

â¢.The health of the Chinese crew on the
steamship Algoa is giving the Pacific
officials considerable anxiety. The
Algoa has be^n at anchor In Mission
Bay # ginoe llarch. The exclusion act
prevents the Asiatics that make up her
crfiw from coming ashore and the con
finement is beginning to tell its tale.
. The appearance on board of beri-beri
Â¦ -has added to the burden of those re
sponsible for the weJfaru of the Celes
tial sailors. There was a death from
the dread disease some months ago. An
.other victim, elck and helpless, was
shipped to China on the Korea and yes
â¢trxday death claimed a third. Berl
_rÂ»<Â»ri to the lay eye closely resembles lo
eorrjotor ataxia and is just as surely
'fatal.
"' .-The Chinese on the Algoa have re
fused to vary their diet with the fresh
. fneats and vegetables freely provided,
and to the monotony of diet as much
"as the confining nature of their erist
. oijce Is ascribed much of their 111
â¢health.
. A few days the chief cook and his

Under the instructions of Judge de Haven,
given to the Jury on Thursday Di the Nana
mat'su case, there are several men In Jail
serving sentences for smuggling who never
should have been convicted. Unless Judge de
Haven changes his opinion as to the Interpre
tation of the decision in the Captain Keck
case it will be impossible to convict a smug
gler until after he has landed the goods be
yond the customs lines, In which event the
goods and the smuggler will have escaped In
nine cases out of ten. This class of casts
differ from the Keck case because there Is no
doubt as to their intention to smuggle. The
concealment of the goods, the neglect to de
clare them when requested by the customs
officials to do ro, are circumstances clearly
showing the criminal intent of the. smuggler.
If Judge de Haven adheres to his opinion It
will be a waste of time for customs officers
to search passengers and baggage on the gang
plank or on the vessel. The only thing lelt
for them to do will be to allow the sus
pected smugglers and their baggage to escape
and then follow them up and arrest them be
fore the property shall have been disposed of.
Duncan E. McKlnlny, Assistant United
States District Attorney, who prosecuted
the case, has notitled Acting Collector
William B. Hamilton of the opinion of the
court. Duncan McKInlay spoke as fol
lows of the case:
The jury was sent out to deliberate at
2:25 p. m. and was discharged at 8;30 p.
m.. having failed to agree. Six were for
conviction in spite of the positive instruc
tion of the court.
In regard to this Indictment, gentlemen, I
deÂ«m It my duty to say to you that there is
no evidence whatever to sustain it, and it will
be your duty to return a verdict of not guilty
as to that Indictment. There can be no smug
gling of goods within the meaning of the law
unless they actually rats the line of the cus
toms officers. The mere attempt to clandes
tinely introduce goods into the United States
is not Fmuggllng within the meaning of the
statute upon which this indictment is framed.
So, gentlemen, there will be left for your con
sideration the charge contained in the second
indictment, number 40UO.
Gentlemen of the Jury: There are two In
dictments against the defendant. They have
been coneolldated, and you are required to re
turn a verdict upon each of the indictments.
The Indictm-jnt which Is numbered 4102 -con
tains two counts. In the first one of which the
defendant Is charged with smuggling into the
port of San Francisco certain articles, and the
second count charges him with lnrnort Ing the
same articles Into the United States contrary
to law.
It does not happen very often that a
jury disregards the Instructions of the
court to acquit the defendant, but such
was the case with the jury that tried
Naoi Nanamatsu last Thursday on a
charge of smuggling sites. The defend
ant was caught with the goods in his
possession before he had passed off the
gangplank, and his attorney raised the
point that, in acocrdance with the de
cision in the case of the United States
vs. Keck, the prisoner and the smuggled
goods never having escaped beyond the
control of the customs officials, no smug
gling had been done.
In the Keck case the customs officials
boarded the ship before she had arrived
in the harbor of New York and finding
a quantity of diamonds concealed in the
captain's cabin seized them and placed
the captain under arrest on a. charge of
smuggling. On the appeal it was held
that, as the goods had not been brought
through the customs lines, it was impos
sible to determine whether the captain
had intended to smuggle the diamonds.
In other words, he had not been given an
opportunity to show a criminal intent."
Upon this point Judge de Haven
charged the jury as follows:

are 191, against 176 last week, 238 the pre
ceding week and 200 the corresponding:
week last year, and in Canada 7, against
11 last week, 8 the preceding week and
19 last year.
Wheat, including flour, exports for the
week ending September 3 aggregate 3,131,
234 bushels, against 3,243,056 bushels last
week.
Business failures in the United States
for the week ending September 3 were
163 against 142 last week, 133 in the like
week of 1902 and 129 in 1901.
In Canada failures for the week number
eighteen against twenty last week and
fourteen In the same week a year asro.
R. G. Dun & Co.'s weekly review of
trade to-morrow will say:
A startling contrast is shown when com
parison is made with the corresponding
week of last year in trade. Prices were
then tending upwafd in many branches
of industry, new business was coming
forward more rapidly than it had been
and in the security market all records
for activity and high prices were being
surpassed.
Later events have demonstrated that
the situation was unhealthy and specu
lative excesses have been followed by re
action and readjustment. Conservativsm
was then the exception; it is now the
rule. Prospects for steady gains and
their maintenance are brighter under the
present system. Legitimate business will
continue- to suffer from speculation and
the high fate for exchange will militate
against industrial expansion, but in the
long run a larger degree of caution should
prove beneficial. Buyers are- still com
ing to the leading markets In great num
bers and testify .to the sound condition of
business at the interior. Manufacturing
plants are busy throughout New Eng
land aside from cotton mills and there
is notable activity in wearing apparel at
the South, while prospects for a large fall
retail trade are bright everywhere. Al
ready there is traffic congestion at sev
eral points, despite the fact that cropS
have only just begun to move, and rail
way earnings in August show gains of
9.3 per cent over last year and 17.4 per
cent over 1901. Undoubtedly ,low prices
have, had the effect of curtailing produc
tion in the iron and steel Industry.
Wool is'flrm at Eastern markets.
I Wool ia firm on demand sufficient to
cover sales of goods. Lumber is active
and firm at the Westjf butleather is slow
and 'draggy at the East, where laborcon
ditions are not altogether settled.
NEW YORK, Sept. 4.-Bradstreet's to
morrow l will say: Crop developments
have been mostly favorable, fall Jobbing
trade reports indicate further improve
ment and monetary conditions show lesa
tension. The tone of general business is
conservative and the tendency is to elimi
nate anything In the nature of specula
tion or overextension from business. The
manufacturing industry shows continued
activity, except in such lines as cotton
and silk production, which note the in
fluence of special conditions, and some
lines of iron and steel. Evidence of an
approaching slackening in the output of
anthracite coal is to be seen. Some im
provement is noted in the car scarcity
trouble and gross earnings of railways
continue large, but increased cost of ope
rations and heavy improvements limit net
receipts. Failures show only the- usual
midsummer volume so far as number is
concerned, but average suspensions foot
up a larger total of liabilities, particu
larly of small financial institutions and
manufacturers.
The State Harbor Commission notified
the Board of Supervisors yesterday that
certain individuals have encroached on
Steuart street immediately south of Har
rison by erecting buildings thereon. The
communication Is accompanied by a map
showing the exact condition of affairs,
and continues:
"At that point one-half of the street is
under the Jurisdiction of the Harbor
Commission and the other half under the
Jurisdiction of the city. This board de
sires to take the necessary legal steps
to cause the removal of these encroach
ments, and in that behalf desires the co
operation of the Board of Supervisors."

There are 5.0JO.QQO salmon eggs at Sis

Among the notable absentees was C. E.

would have earned th* title pt open

tho Oakland Golf Club, though It was said
the Folger brothers had been practicing

frequently than the men. Miss Edith
Ch'jw-brough, the winner, played a clean,
accurate gam".
The new Hghteen-hole . course, which
was first played on In competition during
the golf week, Is a most picturesque and
interesting one. In many places the fair
green Is soft and a well-played ball may
find a difficult lie; while, owing to the
fact that the teeing grounds and dense
chaparral are to the right, slicing Is often
cruelly punished. But after a winter's
rain has compacted the ground the fair
green will be excelle nt, and the course is
wide enough for a straight. player. The
turfed putting greens are unusually large
anÂ«l are already In fine condition.

SCOTTISH howling, for which the
Commissioners of Golden Gate
Park in their beneficence provided
a home in the public playground,
has thrived beyond all expectations.
While the game will not develop
a set of muscles such as violent physical
exercise will bring out, it_has many ad
vantages. It takes its devotees out of
doors Into the sunshine and the fresh air,
and affords gentle exercise under condi
tions restful to the eyes and the nerves,
strained in the rush and worry of the
world. The devotees of the healthful pas
time are drawn from all classes of so
ciety, running the gamut from ministers
to men of more lowly callings.
Last season play on the. park green
wan confined almost exclusively to Sat
urday afternoons. With the 'development
of the game this did not satisfy the play
ers, so this year the green has presented
an anim&ted appearance every evening.
Play has been continued In th- deepen
ing twilight until the course of the bowls
could no longer be determined. The park
green will accommodate forty-eight play
ers, Â«nd there are usually half that num
ber awaiting their turn ttl the game.
The standard of play Is maintained by
tournaments, each of which extends over
several months. One in which sixty-four
players took part and which was finished
recently was won by T. C. Lawson, pres
ident of the San Francisco Scottish Bowl-
Ing Club. Another, with a like number
of entries, is already under way. Matches
are played at the convenience of the con
testants, but the first round must be
completed before the 12th Inst. The final
game must be played before November 14.
Enthusiasts in Oakland organized a
club, with James P. Taylor as president.
Having no available public park, the
members purchased a piece-of ground and
laid out a green, upon which thirty-two
players can compete at one time. The
grounds will be opened for play on Ad
mission day, when the best sixteen play
ers from this cJty will meet a like num
ber of the home club in a special match.

THE California Coursing Committee
stake, the first of the important cours
ing events of the winter season, will
be run at Union Coursing Park on the
20th inst. The park on that occasion will
be under the control of the committee.
This is the first benefit it has had during
its existence of five years and the of
ficials hope to see it well supported both
by greyhound owners and by others in
terested in the sport.
The committee Is made up of twenty
fcur delegates and associate members,
each of whom will be represented by the
pick of the greyhounds of the West. In
addition to the members' stake there will
be an open and a consolation event.
Cecil Lyon of Sherman, Tex., president
of the American Coursing Board, and L.
F. Barteis of Denver will be among the
prominent men represented. Pocatelli
will run as the nomination of P. J. Reil
ly if he recovers from his injuries in time.
J. R. Dlckson, the dean of California
coursing, will be represented by A. R.
Curtis' Rector. Judge John Grace will
name George Xethercott's Barge.
A. R. Curtis has sold Anchor, one of the
few greyhounds of Skyrocket blood still
in the running, to H. Pechner.
Joseph Shea has sold Belfast to L. Be
rcmlo.
M. C. Delano has named the pick of his
Fortuna Favente-Golden Russet puppies
Hudson. This is pronounced the finest
lcoklng puppy Mr. Delano has ever raised
and many noted ones have come from
his kennel.
J. J. Lavln, the St. Louis coursing man,
has purchased a 'promising brindle- puppy
by Fortuna Favente from Ralph Orth
weln. The latter is disposing of his ex
tensive kennel.
The Interstate Coursing Club officials
have announced the following committees
as having charge of two of their forth
coming events: Futurityâ J. R. Dickaon.
E. Hood and W. H. Kocher; John Grace
challenge cupâ J. H. Rosseter, W. H.
Kocher and Victor Noble.
The card at Union Coursing Park for
to-morrow is fairly bristling with class.
The injury to Pocatelli will probably pre
vent the Nethercott crack from appear
ing on the field with Palo Alto. With this
exception and that of Sacramento Boy
the majority of the hounds with any pre
tentions to class will start. The first
brace will be slipped upon the arrival of
the 10:15 a. m. train. The likely winners
look to be:

AMONG the Califomians present at the
recent -regatta at Astoria was the
well-known Dolphin oarsman and
sculler A.' W. Pape. Although he
viewed the races there with much Inter
<st he did not take any part in them.
Leander Stevenson was a'.so at Astoria
and arranged a match to take place be
tween Gloss of the Portland Rowing Club
and Pape some time next year, either in
San Francisco or Portland. Gloss ha-s
been doing such good work in the single
shell lately in British 'Columbia, at Porf
land and at Astoria that he would have
several backers in Portland, while Pape
has many warm supporters In Snn r"raji
clsco.
There is considerable variation Jn the
length of the racing sheik used by dif
ferent scullers. Gloss. of Portland uses
one of the new short boats, twenty-six
feet In length, while Patton of the same
place -pulls in an old -style boat thirty
two feel long. Pipe's shell is thirty feet
long, but most of the scullers in tlv;
Eastern States are using twenty-eight
foot craft. Pape looks thin .and some
r.hat worn out by the heat of the sum
mer spent In the Eastern States, but ex
pects to rpgaln his lost weight in Calfor
nla. â¢ -
Gloss, the Portland single sculler, who
had been beaten a short time previously
by De Bressey at Victoria, B. C. turned
the . tables on his opponent at Astoria.
On Wednesday he beat him clearly by a
length or two, but as, there were no
Judges at the finishing line De Bressey
claimed it was no race. The i next das-
Gloss and De Bressey pulled again. Pat
ton of Portland and Springer of Van
couver being also in the race. Gloss took
the lead, but near the finish a Whitehall
boat crossed his bows, delaying him, and
a little later stopped De Bressey. It wa3
ordered that the race should be rowed
over. On 'the third 7 occasion Gloss was
leading and' was about one furlong from
th'e finishing line .when De Bressey ran
into a box that was floating about, break-
Ing his shell and having to be picked up.
The oarsmen of San Francisco Bay ex
pect to be taking part in four-oared shell
races next year. The Ariel Rowing Club
has purchased a four-oared paper shell,
which,, while It Is not new, is a good boat
and can be put into, excellent condition.
The ? Alameda Boat i Club - oarsmen are
ready, to take up shell ".racing, and the
University of California. and the Olympic
beat clubs will, also do. so. Next year
the oarsmen of San. Francisco- Bay will
be able to compete In {the same races as
the crews from. British Columbia, Seattle,
Portlands and other, places.
The" Alameda oarsmen are pleased with
the treatment .received at Astoria, where
they won the. barge races on two days.

BERKELEY, Sept. 4.-The task of
forming z. football-, ?'iw-n to meet
the Stanford team began with the
linlng-up of the men at the Univer
sity of California on Tuesday. Graduate
Manager Decoto, Trainer Christie, Coach
Wblpple and his assistant, Percy Hall, de
cided that in^order to win they must get
their materials together early, and so they
laid out their plans accordingly. Brom
now on' until the great trial of skill and
strength In November both men and their
trainers will be busy.
California is lucky In having most of
last year's . veterans still in college, be
ssides most of the second-team men, who
were almost as good as the varsity. Of
the line men there remain Captain Over
all, Stow, Stroud, Howard, Demeritt and
Hudson. The exceptions are Albertson
and Heitmuller,- who graduated. Hudson
did not expect to return to college and
he was counted upon as lost to the team,
but at the last minute he decided to come
back, bo that the" team will retain one- of
its ablest men.
For backs the team will have the stars
of last yearâ Mini, More, Muther and Ris
ley. Mini is a graduate student, but
eligible to play another year, and though
he f-ays he will not play again the col
lege Is confident he can be prevailed upon
to change his mind. The loss of Sherman
Is likely to be keenly felt, as he did great
work last year.
The gaps in the line and back of It will
be filled by men who had a jot of experi
ence on last year's substitute list. For
the line there will be Phillips, Force.
Saben, Mlddleton, Craig. Burke and
Oliver, all of whom played In varsity
form, but did not quite make the team.
For backs there will be Â»iich candidates
as Belknap, Boynton, White and Glllls.
The outlook for the freshman team Is
not quite so bright. There does not seem
to be any secondary school stars such as
there have been in former years, though
the crop' may 'yield some good ones. A
good deal was , expected from Kenneth
Hamilton, who played with the California
School of ."Mechanical Arts and the Re
liance team, but he has been found to be
Ineligible to play becaus^_he Is only a
special student and also played profes
sional baseball last summer in the North
west. Claude 'Kern, a player who made
a name for himself on the Berkeley High
School and Lick School . teams, is about
the only other, freshman of whom any
thing is known. Until the men line-up for
a w/iek .or so it will be hard to tell Just
what material the coaches, will "have to
deal with.
From the way things look now there
will be any amount of football excitement
during the Â«ayn, There will be at least
five teann .for the varsities to meet
STANFORD' UNIVERSITY, Sept 4 â
The football season of 1903 Is fairly on at
Stanford and dally practice will be the
order from now until the culmination of
the season's work in the contest with
Berkeley on November 14. The Cardinal,
as Head Coach Lanagan remarked at the
football rally on Monday night, has a
hard uphill tight to make If it hopes to
corne out victorious. Several of the old
varsity players have left college and no
"stars" have appeared with the entering
class to fill their places. U -..%;.%
Nevertheless there are a number of
hardworking determined men appearing
on the gridiron every night and under
the skilful tutelage of Coaches Lanagan
and Slaker a thoroughly coached and
well-trained team may be expected to de
velop. The coaches will Insist on the
strictest observance of training rules bo
that Stanford will have a thoroughly
worthy and representative eleven in the
Held. V-v
While California Is fortunate In having
practically an entire veteran team, Stan
ford Is correspondingly unfortunate In
having but six of the fourteen men who
played- In ! last November's game out on
th.i field this fall. The members of last
ye/r's team who are In the game again
this year are: â¢ L. P. Bansbach, '04, cap

Billy de-Â»Coursey of Los Angeles to
night in fifteen rounds. 'De Coursey was
not' knocked out, but was so clearly de
feated that to avoid the possibility of an
accident. Police Captain .Auble instructed
Referee Eyton. to stop the. light and give
a decision. Eyton promptly declared Nell
the winner.
The fight was -Interesting at all stages,
though not as exciting as. the crowd,ex
pected, owing to. the peculiar style of
Neil, who is essentially, a body fighter.
The boxers were at close range from the
beginning to the end of every round. Nell
was the aggressor at all times, and while
De Coursey made one of tho gamest fights
ever seen here, the little champion held
him safe at all stages.
There was a great deal of clinching and
covering up at close range, but whenever
the referee separated them, Neil was
upon his man immediately. . He would
shoulder into clinches and in the break
away place his head upon De Coursey's
chest and slammed him on the body with
both hands. After De Coursey had been
severely punished in the body and
knocked down several times he assumed a
decided crouch, but in doing so left his
face unguarded to Neil's assault of short
arm blows. Neil fought like a champion
at every stage and even though he had
De Coursey groggy many times and .pent
him down for . the count repeatedly, he
took no chances of one of the local man's
wild swings.
A crowd of five thousand spectators
cheered the decision of Referee Eyton. v

and third and. two gone to the bench,
Francis soaked the leather out to left

Dr. Mosklman had a disastrous day at
third and committed two errors that were
bad ones. To offset this he landed square,
ly on the solar plexus of the leather
thrice and they were all good ones. He
brought in the first Cripple tally In the
first by scoring Willie O'Hara f rop sec
ond base, where he landed by means of a
hit and a sacrifice. .->;-
formance took yesterday at Recrea
tion Park. Instead of many bingles and
dummy work on the bags 'the fans were
treated to *Â» little pitchers* battle, sea
soned by some fast and sensational field
ing. Score: Oakland 2, Portland 1.
Mr. Lee* handed the Brownies a few
they could not assimilate. The lazy man
with the artful swing and the slow and
tiresome motion was in his element. He
would have" given the Brownies the blank
only Dr. Mosklman put a little additional
steam In one of his whips to. the first
bag during tho progress of the eighth
Inning and this alone broke up the win
ning combination.
Loucks, the deep sea twirler with the
famous "spit ball"â calculated to dimin
ish batting averages and break batsmen's
hearts â was not such a howling success
as he has been touted. lie appeared for
the" first time at the Eighth-street lot
yesterday and the Cripples got him when
they wanted him. He used a fasf ball
most of the time and did not show any
curves. But for some cracking good field
ing the Cripples would have made him
look likp a dub.

Yesterday's matches and the drawing
for the mixed doubles resulted as follows:
The fifth and deciding set was going
along evenly until Smith lost the third
game on his own service when he had a
lead of 40-15. This turned the tide in
Bell's favor, giving him a lead of 3-1.
"With victory in sight Bell put more dash
into his play and his opponent was done
for. This was one of the best matches
Eeen at San Rafael In years. The score
was 2-6, 6-4, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2.
In the other half of the seml-flnals
Percy Murdock beat R. N. "Whitney in
straight sets. The score was 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.
The six teams entered In the women's
doubles played down to the final In one
half and the semi-finals in the other.
The Misses Mary and Ethel Ratcliffe of
Berkeley won their way into the final and
will meet the winners of the May and
Violet Sutton-Florenco Button and Gabriel
Dobbins match.
The seven-minute re6t after this set
braced Smith up somewhat and by clever
work at the net and accurate volleying he
brought the score to sets all by win
ning, 6-3.
It was a battle of two wonderfully
clever net playerB, who were about aa
evenly matched as two players could be.
As to condition and stamina there is no
comparison between the two. Bell was
as fresh at the end of the five strenuous
sets as when play commenced. On the
other hand Smith, after the second set,
was tired and winded and had lost con
siderable of his speed.
In the opening set Smith was at his best
and clearly outplayed his opponent, win
ning 6-2. In the second set it was nip
and tuck until Smith lost a game on his
own service which enabled Eell to win
out, 6-4. The third set found Bell some
what improved, while Smith seemed tiring
and netted easy balls. Bell won this set
handily. 6-2.
Percy Murdock of Alameda will meet
on Monday in the final. By far the best
match of the week and the only one that
has gone the full five sets was that in
which Bell met and defeated Grant Smith.

Louis Gomez, a roomer at iÂ£G*i Pacific
street, secured a warrant from Police
Judge CabaniES yesterday for the arrest
of Mrs. Annie Fernandez on a charge of
r< celving stolen property, consisting of
two gold watches, gold chain and charm,
penknife and IS 75 in coin, all of the ag
gregate value of $253 75.
Gomez said the articles and coin were
stolen from his room on August 24. He
quietly made an investigation, which led
him to suspect Jennie Fernandez. 9 years
of ape. a daughter of Mrs. Fernandez,
who lives in the same house. He said he
taxed the girl with being the thief and
she confessed that she had stolen the ar
ticles and coin at the suggestion of her
mother. She slipped into Gomez's room
while he was out .on the day in question,
and after securing possession of the
property took it to her mother. Gomez
made a demand upon Mrs. Fernandez for
the return of the property, but she de
nied that she knew anything about it,
and he decided to have he-r arrested.
Annie Fernandez was arrested last
evening by Patrolman M. F. Joy at her
home on Pacific street and booked at the
City Prison. Five minor children, the
youngest 2 years and the "eldest 8 years
of age. were left at the house. The woman
ivas hysterical when taken to the Hall of
Justice, and was on the verge of collapse.
Antone Fernandez, the husband, stated
that Jennie, the eldest child, who had
bf-en with Gomez, was forced to accuse
her mother of crime by the impending
fear of the lash. The child broke down
after coming home and admitted that
Gomez had forced her to make the con
fession which landed her parent in Jail.
Gomez is given an unsavory reputation
by the police a"nd has been arrested sev
eral times In the past. Mrs. Fernandez
was released on $50 cash bail, furnished
by friends. I % . Â¦

and made a clever opening speech, urging
the members to use their efforts to carry
the bond issue through in the coming
election. He explained that a great im
provement to the Mission district would
be the passing of the bill authorizing the
purchase of the old Jewish burial ground,
bounded by Eighteenth. Twentieth; Do
lores and Church streets. This 'and
would be sold for &?j3.000 and would make
a splendid public park. For sentimental
reasons the owners would rather sell the
land for a public utility than to have it
used privately.

The cheating of these students was
practiced ln a daring way. The student
of two years' standing was. a junior, who
had a "condition" in an entrance require
ment to make up. The applicant for ad
mission was a bright young man and a
friend of the Junior, who appealed to the
applicant to assist him to make up the
"condition." The applicant for admission
consented to the scheme and during the
matriculation examinations handed ln two
papers, one for himself and the other for
the junior. Their duplicity was detected
when the* handwriting was compared.
President Wheeler and Recorder Button
refuse to reveal the names of the offend
ers on the ground that they have already
been sufficiently punished.
The swift punishment dealt the cheats
meets with the commendation of the stu

voiced in an editorial by Richard O'Con
nor, editor of the California, who says
"the effect of the dismissals will cause
many a wavering undergraduate to think
twice before he cheats once."
Summary expulsion from the University

triculation examinations recently held in

President Wheeler was announced in t.ie
form of a notice, which was published

"On account of dishonesty In recent

vigorously until the California dele

From every point of view poured concrete
buildings are superior to those of every other
type. They are monolythlc; the settlement of
the ground beneath them is properly equalized
by reason of tho . enormous stiffness of the
structure; they consist practically of one ma
terial, and variations of temperature cannot
produce unsightly cracks: they become stronger
with age, concrete forming an artificial stone
on which the air has the effect of making it
more solid, thus rendering It better than the
best stone that ever came from a quarry.
The concrete Is poured In forms around the
st^el frame, the thickness of a wall for an
eight-story building being about three and a
half inches. This saves In floor space over
brick and wood from one to two feet and the
construction cin proceed very rapidly. Time,
cost, durability, appearance and everything
that goes to make up building advantages all
favor this new method and Its general adoption
is Inevitable.
Steel and concrete Â¦will be the building mate
rial of the future. They are the only two ele
ments possessing the durability and practica
bility demanded in modern structures. Poured
concrete or lime and cement mortar are pre
servatives for the steel frame work, protecting
It against rust and erosion, and combined they
offer the only true fireproof material for struc
tures.
P. J. Donohoe, the architect, who was
State expert under Governor Budd and
who built the arena at Carson City In'
which Corbett and Fitzsimmons battled
for the championship, is In the city after
an absence of several years In Seattle,
where he now lives.
Donohoe Is an enthusiast over a new
method of constructing buildings. It is
known as the "poured concrete" method,
which has come Into general use in all
the cities of the Northwest and bids fair
to replace brick, atone and stucco facing
In the future. .
Donohoe is authority for the statement
that __ many persons contemplating tne
erection of buildings In this city will take
a trip to "Washington, Idaho and Mon
tana for the purpose of inspecting struc
tures that have been built on this system,
and he expects that In the future all im
portant buildings here will adopt this
method. The architect at Palo Alto, ac
cording to Mr. Donohoe, has determined to
employ this material In the future con
struction of the university buildings. Mr.
Donohoe said yesterday:
Nothing more will be done by the City
Trustees with recard to the franchises
until the ordinances granting them to the
Southern Pacific eczne up for second read-
Ing at the meeting of the municipal leg
islators Tuesday night. In the meantime
the Bnard of Trade is moving to have
the City Trustees enjoined from . giving
the franchises and demanding that be
fore such action is taken the matter
be submitted to the voters to pass upon
at a special el*>ction. City Attorney M.
\V. Simpson has advised the City Trus
tees that there is no power vested in
them to enact such a law as the so-called
referendum ordinance now on the city's
statutes and that the City Trustees have
no power to delegate to others the du
ties they themselves are elected and em
powered by law to discharge. Simpson
holds that there is no law that author
izes the cal'.ing of special elections to ob
tain the popular will on any question.
ALAMEDA, Sept 4.â General Manager
Julius Kruttschnltt of the Southern Pa
cific refused this afternoon to recede from
the demand made to the City Trustees
last night that if his company was to
be cranted the two local franchises
the one for the north aide line ba for
fcrty-flve years and the one for the south
side line be for thirty- three years, the
unexplred terms of the corporate life of
the roads. Four of the City Trusteesâ
Presided J. F. Forderer. William M.
Bowers, B. E. Coisbs and C. H. Ham
mond â Â¦went to San Francisco and con
ferred with the railroad manager and At
torneys J. E. Fculds and Frank Shay
cf the law department of the corporation.
Alameda's representatives tried to in
duce Manager Kruttschnltt to accept the
franchises for twenty-five year terms. In
forming the Southern Pacific official that
the people cf this city were strongly op
posed to thÂ« giving of franchises that
would bind the municipality for nearly
half a century. Manager Kruttschnltt
explained that it was not the policy of
the board of directors of the Southern
PeclSc to accept any franchises for less
than fifty years; that such is the life of
the franchises controlled by the company
la nearly every State in 'which it ope
rates, and that the management did not
wish to establish a precedent of accept
ing franchises for shorter terms. He said
it was the aim of the Southern Pacific
directorate to put the lives of the com
ra ay's franchises on a more uniform ba
sis. For these reasons he reaffirmed his
declaration that he could not and would
not accept the local franchises for a
shorter period than his has
asked for.
After considerable discussion Manager
Kruttschnltt consented to have It stipu
lated in the franchise for the south side
line that no overland freight trains shall
be cperated on that road. He would not
agree, however, to having such a clause
embodied in the franchise for the north
side line. Manager Kruttschnitt asserted
that his company intended to run freight
trains on the south side road through
the city, as is being done now. He stated
that a survey for a cut-off from the South
Pacific line to the Niles line, into Oak
land had been made from San Lorenzo
to Fitchburc and that the "sink" route
and Hish-street trestle might be aban
doned. According to Manager Krutt-
Fchnitt, the cost of the proposed cut-off
was estimated at J1S.M0, while it was fig
ured that to rebuild the long trestle across
an arm of San Leandro Bay east cf High
street would necessitate an outlay of
555,000.

Walkirex seems unconcerned. His acÂ«
tlons evidently are not studied, and the
crime to which he has confesed has made
no great impression upon him. Sitting
half around In his chair, he views the
crowd and evinces more Interest In them
than In the'evidences of his guilt as It is
read to the jurors. He makes no effort to
prompt his attorneys, but he appears
alive to what is going on around him.
It 'was expected that his companion,
Anna Ross, who Informed the authorities
of the murder and showed them where
the body had been hidden in proof of her
assertions, would have been put upon the
stand to-day. The reading of the confes
sion, however, was lengthened out until
It consumed the entire day, and court ad
journed with Van Court still upon tho
Etand.
The- courtroom was crowded to-day
with spectators attracted to the trial of
Victor Walklrex. There was barely stand
ing room. Nearly the entire day was
spent In listening to the reading by Court
Stenographer Van Court of his notes of
the confession made by Walklrez imme
diately upon his arrival at the City Pris
on. There was constant sparring of at
torneys over the admlsslbillty of the
most damaging portions of thÂ« statement,
but little by Uttle the story was given to
the Jury. . -

The policeman returned with him to the
scene of the robbery, but the thug3 had
disappeared and up to a late hour this
morning no trace of them had been found.
shortly after midnight a pedestrian was
startled as he reached the corner of Bush
and Polk streets by the command:
"Throw up your hands." He obeyed and
under the persuasion of revolvers In the
hands of two masked robbers handed
over $40. He then obeyed an order to
move on and as soon as a good distance
separated him from the robbers he broke
into a run which he continued until he
met a policeman to whom he told his
story.
As soon as the first robbery was reported
mounted police hurried along the park
drives, but save meeting a new victim
now and then their work was without re
sult.
Golden Gate Park was the scene of a
wholesale raid of the thieves and two
buggies, each containing two persons, and
eix cyclists were halted by the flash of
the desperadoes' guns, and In each In
stance no argument preceded the handing
over by the victims of belongings of more
or less value.
Two robbers, their features hidden be
hind masks, perpetrated the crimes in
the city's pleasure place. They worked
rapidly, and before their first victim had
had time to Inform the police of their
presence In the park they nad despoiled
their last victim and had made good
their escape. No description of any value
could be obtained of the robbers, all of
the startled benefactors of the thugs not
ing little but the. flash of the pistols of
the thieves, the gruff command "Pro
duce," the quick compliance therewith
and the as quickly obeyed order to move
on and not look back at peril of their
lives.
Footpads were busy In the city again
last night, and while the extent of their
operations is not yet known, they added
a number of victims to their lists.

NEW TORK. Sept. 4. â The cotton market
opened firm, two points higher to three points
lower, the irregularity being due to the dis
position among the room element to take
profits while cables, particularly on the de
cline in spot cotton In Liverpool.' encouraged
further liquidatton. After the tall, however,
the bulls supported prices and there seemed a
disposition to expect a reaction after the re
cent heavy losses. On buying of thin descrip
tion the market rallied slightly but soon turned
dull again and was forced down to a point
or two under the finals of yesterday. Around
this level it ruled quiet and irregular for a
time, then around midday was pulled up by
bull traders who did not care to stay short
of the market over the three-day holidays in
view of the low temperatures over the North
west and fears that they might work down
ward Into the belt. This buying carried the
market to the best level of the session or net
seven points higher on September and three
points lower on March. Later In the day.
however, the market became very heavy. Liv
erpool cables were heavy, sellers on the con
tinent sold and the South sent orders on the
short side while large local houses also were
heavy sellers. The market was In fact almost
In a panicky condition and closed barely
steady within a point or two of the bottom
with prices net thirteen to nineteen points
lower. Sales were 800,000 bales.

Dullness characterized the fruit market yes
terday, there belnc very little Inquiry for ship
ping and 'the local demand being light and
confined chiefly to strictly fancy stock. There
was an abundance of poor fruit, particularly
low (rradc Apples and trashy Grapes, which
lessened the sale of good stock. .The top quo
tation for Apples was obtained only for the
best Bellflower and Gravensteins In 4-tier
boxes. Fine Bartlett Pears and choice Peaches
were firm at previous prices, supplies twin^
limited. The canners were cleaning up bulk
lots of Clingstone and Solway Peaches at pre
vious prices and paid a little more for desira
ble lets. Plums and Prunes In small packages
were dull. There was very little canning stock
received and that found prompt sale at un
changed rates. Quinces and Pomegranates
moved slowly, while Figs were steady under
moderate receipts. Cantaloupes and Nutmeg
Melons were In light receipt and firm and
prices of the former range higher. Water
melons were steady and unchanged. There was
net much doing In Grapes, even the very best
offerings being dull. A few lots of Muscat in
bulk sold for canning purposes at $25 per ton.
Strawberries. Raspberries and Blackberries
were In ample supply and choice lots cleaned
up quickly. Surplus stocks of Blackberries
and Malinda Strawberries went to the canners
at 2%c per pound. Citrus Fruits were more
active than for some time past. Mexican
Limes were in light supply and higher.
Lemons were more active, owing to the scarcity
of Umes. and Oranges were wanted for ship
ment to Honolulu. Bananas and Pineapples
were nlentlful and unchanged.

SAN FRANCISCO. September 4â5 p. ra-
THE COAST RECORD.
year are the principal matters to be cleared up
before any definite stand on the future proe
pects of securities is to t>e expected by stock
market commitments. The feeling of confl
derce over the money outlook has gained force
greatly. This was due in an Important dejrre*
V* the und ?retandir.g that $40,000,000 of Gov
ernment funds In the Treasury stood ready
for deposit in bank depositories. The inspiring
effect of this assurance encourages some at
tempt to put up prices of stocks by an ele
ment of professional speculators. But the
banks and large controlling interests In the
great properties who** shares make up the
body of stock dealings appear to have frowned
on these efforts as calculated to defeat the con
ditions of security which are growing up in the
money market. The relaxation of the money
market was felt to be very Important for the
continuance of business activity and prosper
ity. Conditions even for mercantile borrowings
had grown onerous, thus threatening the ex
tension of the depression and contraction
which had swept over Wall street to the In
dustrial and business structure of the whoie
a >untry. The hope has grown that with the
large liquidation offered in the stock market
and by avoiding new speculative Inflation the
usual needs of the fall reason for money may
be met. The premonitory symptoms of the in
terior movement of currency have appeared
this week, and it is clear that the practical
test of the country's money resources is at
hard. Tratlir.g in stocks is likely to halt until
the test I* made. The Government report on
cotton cleai-s up one of the Important elements
of uncertainty and is accepted as assurance of
a plentiful crop. The situation is benefited not
only by Its assurance but by its influence in
prompting the large liquidation of present
speculative holdings of cotton, the promise e^
relief for the consumptive demands of manu
facturers pnd the encouragement to bankers
to offer bills of exchange with the assurance
of a free movement of cotton later with which
to cover the obligations thus assumed. The
American demand on foreign money markets
for exchange is beginning to loom large In the
opinion of those markets. The advance in the
Bank of England minimum rate of dli<count
from S to 4 j>er cent on Thursday was directed
Immediately against Germany, which Is mak
ing very heavy requisitions on the Englloh
gold supply at this time. But Germany's call
ing home of credit* is Indirectly Intended for
the American market. This was clearly s.et
fr.nh jn official utterances on behalf of the
Imperial German Bank several weeks ago In
the form of a complaint that German money
was finely loaned to foreigners to aid an In
dustrial comi*t:tion against Germany.
Tre recall cf German credits thus may be
regarded as rromiited by policy rather than by
the nor.-nal money needs of German markets,
and is made effective In London by reason of
the large amount of German capital which has
twn employed there ever since the rise in in
trr* st rates due to the Boer expenditures. Con
ditkns during the week promiFÂ« normal pro
gress in corn crop, but there has not been
th<; hot fcrmr.g weather tending to correct the
lateness of tne crop and lessen its danger from
farly fr2St. Fugitive rumors of damaging
frotts haw made their presence already, and
the certainty that they will continue to cir
culate, with whatever basis, until the crop
ha* been harvested serves to deter speculative
commitments in stocks. Report? of iron trade
conditions rhow an increase of hopefulness, but
there have been complaints of accumulation
of Fteam Eir*>*= of anthracite and some curtail
ment of production in consequence.
Railrocd earnings continue at a high level
and confidence of railroad officials In future
maintenance of traffic is expressed.
The market fcr railroad bonds Is dull, but In
scrr.e slight investment absorption i* reported.
Government bonds have risen in price in re
sponse to the expected need for additional hold
ings by the banks to eerve as security for the
Increased Government deposits promised.

Character of the Late
Dr. Foute.
The memorial services in honor of the
late Rev. Dr. R. C. Foute were held in
Grace Episcopal Church yesterday morn
ing. Right Rev. Bishop- William Ford
Nichols officiated. He paid a glowing
tribute to the deceased clergyman,- tak
ing for his text the tenth verse of the
third chapter of I Corinthians: "As a wise
master builder."
Dr. Foute was the pastor of Grace
Church for nineteen years, and greatly
endeared himself to his congregation. He
was always bright, sparkling and affable
and a most interesting talker on any
topic that presented itself. He was a
graduate of the Naval Academy and was
a midshipman on the Merrimac when she
was defeated by the Monitor during the
Civil War. For over thirty years he was
a minister of the gospel, having begun his
career in the Southern States Just after
the close of the war.
Many actors and singers use Piso's Cure to

Third â In the course of interviews with
several young ladles on the school premises
Mrs. Keeves has made false and slanderous
statements concerning the attitude of the prin
cipal to herself and her work.
All of which has been seriously detrimental
to the discipline of the school and has threat
ened to Impair Its standard of scholarship.
In view of the importance to the welfare of
the school I resuectfully request that it re
ceive your early attention. Respectfully sub
mitted, WALTER N. BUSH.
Principal Polytechnic High School.
First â In i the school building she grossly
misrepresented to teachers of the school dur
ing school hours statements made to her by
the principal.
Second â That Â«he openly stated to one
teacher in the classroom that she was "on the
fight with the principal."
In accordance with the Instructions received
by me from the Board of Education, Mrs.
Reeves was assigned to Classen In the sub
jects that she had taught before her removal
from the school by the Board of Education in
the spring of 1SW, to wit: Latin, English and
history.
The charge of Incompetency Is based upon
the fact that her knowledge of Latin Is so
slight as to make her attempts at instruction
not only useless but harmful and misleading tc
the puijil. ,
It may be remarked here that with her con
sent and in the face of my protest she was
elected by the board of Education of 1808
head of the Latin department of this school.
The charce of unprofessiona 1 conduct is
based on the facts:
MRS. REEVES ASSIGNED.
Mrs. Reeves stands accused of a grave
charge over the signature of her super
ior and while she realizes Bush did
not use the phrase in Its recognized sense,
she is desirous of having the offensive
term expunged from the report of Prin
cipal Bush, which is now on file as a
public record with the Board of Educa
tion and with Superintendent of Schools
Langdon, Webster's successor in office.
On December 23, 1902, or three days
after the filing of his first report, Bush
filed another communication with the
Board of Education in which he modified
his original charge by accusing Mrs.
Reeves of unprnfefisional conduct only
and incompetency in the teaching . of
Latin. Mrs. Reeves is just as anxious to
have a hearing on these charges as she
is to have the first one thoroughly in
vsetigated. Bush, in his second report,
says that Mrs. Reeves was unprofesional
in that she misrepresented to other teach
ers statements made by Bush to her. The
communication follows:
POLYTECHNIC HIGH SCHOOL,
December 22. lÂ»02.
To the Honorable the Board of Education of
the City and County of San Francisco: I here
by respectfully submit to your honorable board
charges of Incompetency as a teacher and un
professional conduct against Mrs. Irene D.
Reeves.
WANTS TERM EXPUNGED.
The charge, which was part of Bush's
report on the condition of schools, was in
the following terms:
December 20. 1002.
Mrs. I. Reeves, teacher of English and his
tory and Latin.
Deficient in scholarshio in Latin, weak in
scholarship In Knidish and history and
guilty of unprofessional and Immoral con
duct In the school. Respectfully submitted.
XV. N. Bl*SH, Principal P. H. S.
To R. H. Webster, Superintendent of Schools,
etc.
Mrs. Irene D. Reeves, a teacher In the
Polytechnic High School, demands that
she be given a hearing on the charges
preferred against her by Principal W. N.
Bush. Though she has repeatedly re r
quested that she be given a trial, the
Board of Education shows no disposition
to grant her request. Neither does Bush
manifest a desire to accede to her de
mand that he either withdraw his charges
or prove them.
Bush filed the charge with former Su
perintendent of Schools Webster just be
fore the latter's retirement from office
and while accusing Mrs. Keeves of "im
moral conduct," subsequently disclaimed
any intention of using the phrase in its
implied sense. When asked by one of
the school directors to particularize the
charge Bush replied that Mrs. Reeves had
told an untruth about him.

Tyadall Is Interesting.
Those who like to mix instruction with
their entertainment will find something to
tbeir liking- in the psychic evenings of
Dr. Mclvor-Tynda'.l at Steinway Hall
every Sunday night. Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall
has thus far been wonderfully successful
in attracting large and cultured audi
ences, it being no unusual thing for many
to be unable to gain admission. For the
coming Sunday night (to-morrow) there is
an unusually large advance sale of re
served seats, and the indications are that
there will be another large audience. The
evening will be taken up with demonstra
tions of the power of thought by Dr.
Mclvor-Tyndall and by a lecture oc
"Human Electricity" : by Dr. Albert J.
Atkins, a local physician. Dr. Atkins has
promised that he' will tell Dr. Mclvor-

William Stoner, a three-year-old boy,
whose parents resitie at 1021 Shotwell

home at 8:15 o'clock yesterday morning
by a truck driven by Charles Schill, in
the employ of W. J. Jackson. Schill was
arrested on a charge of manslaughter and
released on $50 ball. He said the child
boarded the truck from the rear, ran
across to the other side and fell off under
the hind wheels, which passed over his
head.

The officials of the company were great
ly pleased with the time that the car
made yesterday. The schedule time will
be about one hour and fifteen minutes at
the start. This will undoubtedly be in
creased later.
Should traffic warrant, the company is
prepared to put on a twenty-minute ser
vice, as there is rolling â¢ stock to meet
that requirement.
On the trial trip yesterday only one
stop was made, that being- at the suu
station at Millbrae, where the guests were
invited to make an inspection of the
power-house.
From that point to San Mateo the car
was allowed to run almost to its full
speed, which is forty-five miles an hour.
The road is finely, ballasted and ther*
are very few curves, so no time is lost in
slowing up. I The regular service will be
inaugurated on Monday, September 7.
Cars will leave the corner of Market
and Fifth streets at 6 a. m. and keep up
a half hourly service until 6:30 p. m.,
when they will run hourly until 11:30 p. m.
From San Mateo the first car will leave
at 5:30 a. m. and the half hourly service
will be kept up until 8 p. m. From 8 p.m.
there will be an hourly service until
11 p. m.
At 12 o'clock the last car will leave
San Matto and will connect with the owl
car at San Jose and Ocean avenues at
1:18 a. m.
The new car used on this occasion is
one of the twenty that is "to. do the ser
vice between San Francisco and San Ma
teo. It is arranged in compartments,
having a small smoking-room at the rear.
The actual running time from the cor
ner of Market and Fifth streets to San

The formal opening of the through; elec

every way.

Circus Parade Tuesday.
Mayor Schmitz held a conference in his
office yesterday with John Ringling and
James J. Brady, representatives of the
Ringling Brothers' circus, regarding the
desire of the latter to have a street pa
rade next Monday. The Mayor explained
that the day would be devoted to an ex
hibition of labor's hosts and he thought
it would be graceful on the part of the
Ringling Brothers to forego their parade,
as it might interfere with that of the la
bor unions. Mr. Ringling accepted the
Mayor's views, although the doing away
with the parade means the loss of much
advantageous advertising to the propri
etors of the show.* Ringling stated that
the circus parade of Tuesday will more
than make up for the omission.
Dan Maloney, a slender young man,
with dreamy blue eyes and high forehead,
who experienced such a terrible fall about

There will be a band concert ait Golden

The Commissioners decided that the
time had arrived for beginning the work
of improving Columbia square, bounded
by Folsom, Harrison, Sixth and Seventh
streets. A top dressing of soil, one foot
thick, will be required to bring the
square up to the level of the street. The
superintendent was authorized to adver
tise for 3000 cubic yards of loam. The
proposed Improvement will cost at least
$4000. :^Hnn
Commissioner Lloyd was authorized to
trade one of the bull buffaloes of the
Golden Gate Park herd for a bull of
equal worth belonging to the buffalo band
in the Yellowstone National Park. Major
Pitcher, U. S. A., who has charge of the
Yellowstone herd. Is known in the North
west as a bull trader of superior saga
city. On the Pacific Coast Reuben H.
Lloyd's attainments as a trader of buf
faloes are widely recognized. Time for
the beginning of negotiations between
Major^ Pitcher and Commissioner Lloyd
will soon be announced.
TO TRADE BUFFALO BULL.
The receipts of the Japanese tea garden
for the month of August amounted to
$651 10. The outlay was $330 65, leaving a
profit of $300 45.
Australian park managers offered by
letter to exchange red and black kanga
roos, kangaroo rats, possums, cranes,
black swans and mound-building blrd3
for birds and animals belonging to Golden'
Gate Park. The offer was not accepted,
as* the park on this peninsula is pretty
well supplied with such beasts and birds
as are offered.
During the month of August the re
ceipts of the children's playground
amounted to $3026 80. The expenses for
the same period aggregated 11792 20. The
net profit was $1234 60.
In. view of the large profit the advisa
bility of reducing charges for playground
diversions was considered. President
Spreckels favored the introduction of ad
ditional attractions for the children.
Commissioner Lloyd suggested that the
secretary be directed to prepare a state
ment of the receipts and expenses of the
children's quarters for the year ended
August 31. The suggestion was adopted.
After the figures are submitted the board
will determine whether It is better to
lessen the charges or increase the at
tractions.
Th* Board of Park Commissioners held
a session at the lodge In Golden Gate
Park yesterday afternoon, A. B. Spreck
els, president oi the commission, presid
ing. Commissioners Reuben H. Lloyd and
A. Altman were also present. Commis
sioners Frank J. Sullivan and M. Jasper
McDonald were reported out of town.
The report of Superintendent John Mc-
Laren for the month of August contained
a statement of the work accomplished
during the month with data relative to
improvements under' way. The number
of men at present employed on the sev
eral parks and squares is 295. The new
tennis court is ready for the coat of bi
tumen. Bids for paving the court were
opened yesterday. The contract was
awarded to Stanley J. Fay. the lowest
bidder. He proposes to put in the bi
tumen one inch thick .for 4 cents per
square foot. The Commissioners require
that the bitumen shall be cooked in the
park.
The Standard Oil Company's bid to sup
ply fuel oil at 82 cents a barrel was ac
cepted. \ .
The superintendent reported that Mrs.
Ohnimus and her son, who hold the boat
concession at Stow Lake; were using
eighteen skiffs and seven round, bottom
boats and that the charge to the public
was so reasonable that the profit was not
large. On motion of Commissioner Alt
man Mrs. Ohnimus was allowed to re
tain the concession at the figure of $25
per month.

mediate Investigation of Bush's accusa
tions and he has repeatedly asked that
the matter be brought to trial. Costello
was Mrs. Reeves' attorney when the Su
perior Court ordered her reinstatement
into the School Department, from which
she was consolidated out some years ago.
Mrs. Reeves also secured judgment
against the city for some $3000 back sal
ary. Costello contends that Bush shows
ignorance of the English language when
he characterized an alleged untruth
as coming under the head of immoral
conduct.
Costello says that Bush is evidently de
sirous of getting rid of Mrs. Reeves.
Bush is now endeavoring to have Mrs.
Reeves put on half pay because only half
her time is occupied with the teaching of
history in the Polytechnic School. This
would mean a salary of $50 per month
for the teacher, and the Board of Edu
cation will take up this phase of the ques
tion at its meeting next Wednesday.
