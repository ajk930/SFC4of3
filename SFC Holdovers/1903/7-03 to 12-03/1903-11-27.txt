â¢ It has been common talk among thosa
who. are acquainted with the princi
pals of the tragedy that Garnett. when
wanted, would be easily located, and
the events of yesterday would suggest
that there was good foundation for the
story, for it was not many hours after
McClung died that word was received
at the local police headquarters that
the slayer was in custody there. Gar
nett was arrested in a small lodging
house in Oakland shortly after 8 o'clock
last evening. and half an hour later he
was turned over to Detective Ryan,
who was dispatched from this side of
the bay to get him.
In company with Garnett at the time
of his arrest was H. W. Bradley of the
law firm of Bradley & McKInstry of.
'this city. With Bradley, who. as be
fore stated, is a lifelong friend of Mrs.
Colt and frequently her legal adviser,

Her pleadings finally softened his
heart and with the remark that he
would not kill her he dropped the re

She picked the weapon up and carried,
it. back, to her room, where Dr. Shiels
afterward found it and put it in his
pocket, where It remained until he
turned it over to the police yesterday
morning.
Porter Garnett said last evening that
he remained with Mrs. Colt In her
apartments until nearly daylight yes

would not consider a suggestion to seek
rest until the morning papers had been
brought to her and she had read the ac
counts of the shooting.

It prohibits until further notice all
traffic or business between the ports in
that department and "the rebel depart

"The. Department of Panama having

It is a strange i train of circumstances
that is developing out of the. shooting.
Contradictory, statements have' been
made by. alUthe persons that were in
the apartments of Mrs.' Coit at the time
and j immediately after the shooting j oc
curred.:: Wednesday -. night, after . Mrs.
Coit had apparently. recovered, from the

McClung, : she . instructed ; the hotel : at

her- apartments: At: midnight,: how r
ever, she- received -two -acquaintances.
A few hours later, when the police of
Oakland arrested Garnett, he was in
the company of the attorney. of Mrs.
Coit, preparing his own statement pre
paratory to j giving himself up to-day,
and when taken into, custody he said
the shooting was accidental; that noth
ing would ever come of : his case and
that there ; would; not.be any prosecuV
tion. With marked emphasis he added:
"And you can rest assured of that.".
SITUATION -STRANGE ONE.
McClung's last statement, . â¢ made â¢, a
few hours before he - died, briefly ac
cuses Garnett of the shqoting, but ex
cuses the murderous act on. the ground
that the man, was drunk when he com
mitted the deed. Those at the bedside
of the dying man, among whom . was
his wife, seemingly acquiesced in his
taking this view of the matter. . While
McClung was gasping the few words
that will materially aid Alexander Gar
nett in his defense, Mrs. Colt, .through
the medium. of a relative. Porter Gar
nett, who is a' cousin .of the slayer of
McClung, was preparing a statement
for the press, , in which she, . too, ex
presses the opinion that the deed was
a drunken man's act. .
Mystery is enveloping the tragedy,
which "has attracted widespread inter
est owing to the prominence of those
involved. There is evidence. of an ef
fort being made to conceal something,
but just what only those who figure in
the strange case are able to tell. They
not only refuse to clear the mystery,
but seem to be trying to throw obsta
cles In the way of the Investigators.

Hospital yesterday, afternoon. A few
hours later Garnett was arrested in a
lodging-house in Oakland and was im
mediately brought to this city, where
he is now confined In the City Prison.
A charge of murder will be placed
against his name.
Major J. W. McClung, who was shot
down by Alexander L. Garnett
Wednesday evening in the apartments
of Mrs. Lillian Hitchcock Colt In the
Whitney. , He , then said that he was
going out to "bring Bradley," referring
to H. W. : Bradley of the law firm of
Bradley & McKirr*stry, who is an old
friend of Mrs. j Colt and has^ acted as
her legal adviser. Garnett left the ho
tel, presumably to go to the Hoffman
Cafe, where he \ evidently expected to
find Bradley. He returned later to
Mrs.- Coifs "rooms and was met by her
in the hallway, where they conversed
for a few. seconds,' and then,' after ask
ing for! his 'overcoat, he departed for
good.

hend Garnett on his second or third
visit to .Mrs. ; Coifs rooms, when two
physicians were close, at hand and the
hotel filled with guests and employes,
who would have, readily responded to
a call, is a matter that is yet to be de
termined by the police in their investi
gation.. . .
STATEMENT REVISED.
. Yesterday, .when Porter Garnett. gave
out I Mrs. Coit's statement to the pa
pers, he explained that It had been pre
pared by. him at Mrs. Coifs suggestion
and that they had together gone over
it carefully a number of times during
the night. Porter Garnett vouched for
its â¢ correctness.. in every â¢ detail. , Last
evening, however, he made the rounds
of the newspaper, offices with a. cor
rected -statement. the< main feature of
which was relative to ' Garnetf s actions
after, the shooting â¢ and especially that
portion referring, to Garnett's leaving
Mrs. -.Coifs rooms the second time. He
sald.Mrs. Coit was, not sure that Gar
nett'went to the Hoffman Cafe, but re
membered his returning and demanding
his overcoat and" pistol and .that she
told him to "hurry and get out of here,"
Porter Garnett also gave a new version
of 'Alexander. Garnett's parting, with

rected statement.! Immediately after the
shooting, '; McClung, ."although i_ badly

turned his weapon on .her and told
her. he was going to 1 kill her. She was
pleading .with him when McClung, who
had j been lying on the floor, . slowly
rose, a. movement that .was quickly
noted by Garnett, who turned .from,
her a moment: As 'he did so Mrs. Colt
said' she stepped over to the -telephone,
but ', Garnett anticipated her intentions
by -dashing the phone, from: her; hand.
Â¦McClung by ;this; time had opened his

Dr. George sriiels, who attended Mc-

bullet that was intended for her. Mc-

his pistol to her breast and threatened
to shoot her if she made an. outcry... A

had committed a crime, he suddenly

WASHINGTON. Nov. 26.â The Presi-
"Hall to the nation," concluded Mr.
3yran, "whatever her name, who leads
he world toward this high ideal for
he lasting good of all humanity."
Touching the theme of Thanksgiving
lay. Mr. Bryan spoke eloquently of the
natural resources and advantages of
;he United States, for which the peo
ple must return thanks to God, and of
:he ideals of liberty ana progress, for
which they must thank their English
progenitors. He urged the necessity
tt the present generation bequeathing
to posterity some gift commensurate
Â«ith the blessings they had received
*rom their ancestors and suggested that
;hey bequeath the ideal of international
imity, of which The Hague arbitration
ribunal treaty was a lasting monu
nent.
Mr. Bryan said he had profited ex
ceedingly by his visit to the Bank of
England. He wanted to call attention,
however, to the fact that the murderous
attack by an insane man with a re
volver en Mr. Kenneth Grahame. the
?prretary of the bank, occurred the day
before he called.
ThÂ«Â» For-ech of the Embawador was
followed by an ovation to Mr. Bryan,
which lasted for Beveral minutes. Mr.
Bryan, in responding, paid a graceful
tribute to the English guests of the so
ciety. He said the highest compliment
he was able to pay was that in looking
over the tables he was unable to dis
tinguish the English from the Amer
ican women present. He thanked the
British nation for the kindly forbear
ance it had shown in receiving him â
the protectionists for letting him land
at all and the gold bugs for not having
deported him immediately after his ar
rival.
Embassador Choate. responding to
the. toast to his health, which was pro
posed in complimentary terms by Lord
Davey, took up the Duke of Marlbor
ough's reference to the mutual sympa
thies of the American and British peo
ples and said there had been reason
heretofore to suspect some such settle
ment on the part of the Duke, since he
had set an example in one form of the
Anglo-American alliance on which the
people of both countries were able to
look with entire approval.
Turning to Mr. Bryan Mr. Choate
said it was the custom of Americans,
torn from their native shores, to gather
together annually and return thanks.
The American Society in London had
now among them another of these ex
iles, for whom personally h r \ as Em
bas'sador. had hoen doing the best he
could. He had taken Mr. Bryan to visit
the Bank c.f England, where he was
ah!<? to study the fiscal question in its
native lair. ThÂ» company would be
edified, said Mr. Choate, had they heard
Mr. Bryan cross-examining the gover
nor of the Bank of England. The Em
bassador said he had aided Mr. Bryan
to hear Mr. Asquith. Mr. Chamberlain,
Lord Gopchen and Lord Rosefcery, all
within forty-c-ight hours, so if his views
on the fiscal question were not utterly
mixed they would appreciate at least
the quality of the man they had before
them.
The Duke of Mariborough proposed a
toast to President Roosevelt and. ad
dressing himself to the interests which
England and_the United .State* have In

est praise to President Roosevelt and

Herbert.
There were a number of notable
guests at the banquet, including the
Duke of Marlborough. Earl Denbigh of
the Honour-able Artillery Company, Lord
Davfy, General Ian Hamilton. Gilbert
Parker; Major Arthur Lee, formerly
military attache at Washington, now

LONDON, Nov. 25. â Thanksgiving
<5ay was celebrated by the American
Society ia London at a banquet given
at tbe Hotel Cecil to-night. There were
more than 400 covers. William J.
Bryan was the exiest of honor.
The Eseeches, while flavored by the
seasonable cheer and references to
Anglo-American friendliness, developed
particularly into a duel of repartee,
pood natured but almost sub-acid, be
tween Mr. Bryan and Embassador
Choate. , Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦ Â¦. f-
Dr. Herran. the Colombian Charge,

DUE TO VARILLA'S URGING.
The action taken by the Panama
junta doubtless is due, in part at least,
to, the urgent representations of Minis
ter Varilla that prompt steps be taken
with a view to the ratification of the
treaty as soon as it shall reach Pan
ama. Last Saturday the Minister ca
bled a long synopsis of the treaty to
Panama, and since that time had been
in communication with the Govern
ment on the subject.
The Minister recounted with a" great
deal of gratification to-night the rapid
progress of events since the birth of
the new republic of Panama, three
weeks ago, ending to-day with the dec
laration of the junta to ratify the Pan
ama canal treaty.
Minister Varilla calls attention to the
fact that the message received by him
is signed not only by the members of
the Junta, but also by the Minister of
Foreign Relations, which, he says, gives
the communication the character of a
formal decree of the Government.
"PANAMA, Nov. 26.â Varilla, Minis
ter Plenipotentiary of the Republic of
Panama, Â¦ Washington â In view of the
approbation given by the delegates?,
Amador and Boyd (the commissioners
who were sent by. the Government of
Panama to confer, with Varilla) to the
Hay-Varilla treaty, you are authorized
to notify officially the Government of
the United States that as soon as the
document is received by tne junta of
the Government of the republic oi Pan
ama it will be ratified and signed.
"J. A. ARANGO.
"TOMAS ARIAS,

WASHINGTON. Nov. 26.â Official
confirmation of the determination of
the Panama Government to ratify the
Hiiy-Varilla Panama canal treaty was
received by Minister Varilla at 2:S0
o'clock to-day. The State Department
being closed to-day, Varilla took the
news informally to Loomis, who is act
ing in the absence of Hay. The Min
ister's dispatch follows:
NOTIFICATION FROM JUNTA.
PANAMA. Nov. 26.â The junta, com
posed o Jose Augustin Arango, To
nias Arias and Manuel Espinosa, held
a meeting this morning, all the Minis
ters of state and Councillors being
present, and unanimously decided to
ratify the canal treaty as soon as it is
received here, and authorized Minister
Bunau-Varilla officially, to transmit the
junta's decision to the United States
Government. The decision of the junta
was received with great joy tnrough
out the isthmus, without distinction of
parties or classes. Rear Admirals
Walker and Glass have been informed
of the action taken by the junta.
In four or five days the helium lines
grew brighter and in another week the
spectrum of helium was positively
biazing in the hermetically sealed
tubes that hod been filled with the pure
emanations, or gaseous output, of ra
dium. In other words, one element
had been literally seen to change into
another of a quite different nature un
der the eyes of the experimenter.
What is this, asked Sir William, but
an actual case of that transmutation
of one element into another in which
ancient alchemists believed when they
sought to change lead into gold and in
cidentally founded the modern science
of chemistry?
Editorially commenting on Ramsay's
great discovery, the Daily Mail says:
"It is as though gold were to change
into iron of Its own accord and com
pletely upset the laws of the old chem
istry- No wonder that, with this amaz
ing fact before them, scientists are
hopeful of reading the riddle of the
universe."
TRANSFORMATION TO HELIUM
LONDON, Nov. 26.â What may prove
an epoch-making discovery in the field
of chemical research is announced by
Sir William Ramsay with regard to ths
mysterious substance radium, which
for two years past has been puzzling
men of science.
Sir William Ramsay, whose name i3
associated with that of Lord Ray!e"gh
in the study of argon and helium, said
at a meeting of the London Institution
that he had observed and definitely
ascertained that radium ?ave off heavy
gas, which slowly changes ui'.o helium
n.nd then vanishes.
The importance of this discovery,
which has been suspected by scientists
for pome months past, lies, according
to the Daily Mail, in the fact that it
appears to revolutionize all old theories
about chemistry. Hitherto chemistry
has been based on the theory that the
elements are constant and that one
cannot change into another, but now it
is seen that radium of its own accord
and without external interference turns
into_a totally 'different _ element.; .^ '
LONG RESEARCH REWARDED. 7
In his lecture Sir William Ramsay
described how, after a long search Into
the problem of what became of the
minute* particles with which radium
was always parting, he was quite lately
rewarded.
Besides its other manifestations ra
dium constantly gives off an emanation
which seems to behave in all respects
like heavy gas. It can be collected in
tiny flasks, measured and weighed and
used to display the characteristic prop
erties of radium, but it is not perma
nent. In about a month it entirely dis
appears.
What becomes of it? Sir William
Ramsay has caught this emanation in
the act of vanishing. He found that
after it had been collected for a cou
ple of days its spectrum, which pre
viouely was entirely unlike any yet
studied, began to display the typical
yellow line of helium gas. first known
and christened by its constant presence
in the sun.

bility that an attempt to land Colom
bian troops in Panama might mean a
clash with the United States. He con
tinued:
"Colombia does not want to make
war on Panama," he said. "She wishes
to make arrangements looking toward
a settlement. . .She. wishes to regain
Panama, and, if she does not, war is
probable. To say whether she will
make war is very hard to answer. War
with the United States is not to be con
eldered."
While he was not willing to talk re
garding his mission or to discuss what
steps would be taken by the commis
sion, he was willing to speak of condi
tions in Colombia and the feeling down
there when he sailed eleven days ago.
Manotas said he could not tell Just
what action would be taken to obtain
a settlement of the Panama situation
more favorable to Colombia, as his In
structions had not yet reached him

John Donnelly confirms the state
ment that Garnett immediately after
the shooting- rushed into the Hoffman
Cafe, with every appearance of a crazy
man. Donnelly said: "When Garnett
came Into the cafe, he looked to me
as though he had gone crazy. He
rushed up to me and said, 'I have done
something, but I- don't, know what I
have done." Then he dragged me-out
to the cigar stand In the front of the

WASHINGTON, Nov. 26.â President
Roosevelt's annual message to Con
gress, which will be presented on the
opening day of the regular session, on
December 7, Is nearly completed, and
by next week it will be In printed form.
Most of the text is in the hands of the
public printer, but there are one or two
subjects on which the President has not
reached a decision as to how he should
present them to Congress. One 6t
these, it is sa!d. is the agitation to re
duce the tariff on all the products from
the Philippines, a bill to that effect
having failed of passage in the last ses
sion at the last moment.
Secretary Root ana Governor Trft,
who will succeed Root, have urged Ihe
President, it is said, to impress upon
Congress the necessity for this legis
lation. The President, on the other
hand, is represented as being undecided
whether It would be well to raise a fur
ther tariff agitation at this time so
close upon the heels of the Cuban reci
procity legislation. The question of re
ducing the tariff schedules for the Phil
ippines is one on which the party lead
ers differ widely. It has been proposed
by a bill now in Congress to abolish
all Philippine duties, except on sugar
and tobacco, which would be reduced
50 per cent of the present tariff rate.
Governor Taft has urged that legisla
tion of this nature is necessary to de
velop the Philippine Industries, and
whatever the President may recom
mend doubtless will cause debate and
opposition.

"I made up my mind that I would
not let a matter of that kind drive from
me an old and valued friend. I went to
her rooms in the Palace Hotel intending
to apologize for what I had said before.
"Major McClung was there at the
time. I did not want to make my ex
planation before a Â£hird party, though
Major McClung had always been a
friend of mine. I asked him to retire,

he would nc-t go, and I may have said

Garnett said that he had been in bad
health for some time and had been
drinking heavily. He admitted that the
story told by Mrs. Coit concerning a
quarrel with her over a game of crib
bag e was true and his drunken condi
tion was the cause of the trouble. Con
tinuing Garnett said:
Garnett was very much unstrung and
looked as if he had slept but little. He
chewed or smoked incessantly, and
while he was very nervous^ it was the
nervousness that follows drinking and
the loss of sleep, rather than that of
fear. He seemed to have no worry as
to the outcome of the case. He talked
in short sentences, but seemed to have a*
very clear idea of what had happened.
He repeated many times that he was
drunk at the time of the shooting, and
that Major McClung had tried to put
him out of the room and that the pistol
was .discharged in the struggle. Then
he claimed that he asked Mrs. Coit to
shoot him and handed her the pistol,
and that he was the one who called the
doctor before any one else summoned
him.
SLAYER IS UNSTRUNG.
There was no objection upon the part
of any one, and Garnett and Bradley
accompanied the two officers to the
â¢Oakland City Prison, while Fontaine,
the' third man of the trio, went his way.
"Mr. Garnett would have given him
self up to-morrow morning. We were
just talking with him about the mat
ter," said the man who was writing as
he put the paper upon which he was at
work in his pocket. The speaker then
announced himself as H. W. Bradley,
attorney, and friend of all parties.
The information that Garnett was in
Oakland was sent to Police Captain
Petersen, who immediately detailed
Sergeant Green and Detective Kyte
upon the case. The Information was
accurate, for it took them/ to 804 San
Pablo avenue, a small lodging-house
just above Twenty-second street. The
officers had no difficulty in finding the
room and when they entered, three
men were smoking violently, while one
was writing busily.
"Who is Mr. Garnett?" demanded
Detective Kyte, and two men at once
pointed to a small, nervous man who
made no protestation.
"I'm an officer, and I guess we want
you," said Kyte.

tion of a document, which the attorney
took charge of when Garnett was tak
en Into custody. It was admitted to be
a statement of Garnett's side of -the
case and later Bradley issued 'a short
summary of the statement, as follows:
"I had no animosity toward or griev-'
ance against Major McClung. I have
always considered him a great friend.
I had no real grievance of any kind
against Mrs. Coit and consider her my
best friend. The pistol being a self
cocker, and being cocked, as I general
ly carry i.t, it went off In the scuffle
with the major, while he was trying to
take it away from me, and put me out
_pf the room. I deplore more than I
can express this most unfortunate af
fair. I was under the -influence of
stimulants when I entered Mrs. Colt's
apartments at the Palace Hotel. I
have been in bad health for months."
\',Ip w&s. half past 11 last night when 'a j
so-called' identification of 'Alexander '
Garnett was made. : Captain of Detec
tives Martin, Attorney Bradley and pf. r
Whitney came / out from .Mrs. Colt's,
apartments, accompanied by a maid,
..who gaVe her name as Nora Keanealy..
V "Is that theman you saw in Mrs.,
Gpit's rooms?? "asked Captain Martin;
of <the cirl/ :' .' ' " \ '
that is th'e man," . replied the!
'maid! as she faced Garnett.'â¢
;/"y6u did not see any shooting in Mrs. ;
Colt's rooms?" asked Garnett ' of "the:
girl. â¢"/;
"No, I did not," replied the maid. ,
"That's all right," replied Garnett,
and the "identification" came to an
end.
Captain of Detectives Martin in
structed Detective Ryan to take Gar
nett to the City Prison and lock him
up and the officer departed with his
prisoner. The elevator In which the
assassin of Major McClung and his
"guard descended to the ground floor of
the^Palace Hotel was filled with a gay
crowd of men and women, but none
knew v the identity; of the man; who
stood, beside the detective. The officer

that statement and did not insist on the
identification 'required' by law.
When Garnett was arrested by De-
Arriving on this side of the bay De
tective Ryan took his prisoner first to
the Palace Hotel, which. was reached in
a few : minutes. after. 2 10 o'clock. The
two proceeded "directly to the apart
ments ofj. Mrs.*-. Coit, where it was the
evident plan . to "have Â§ Garnett identi
fied by Mrs; Coit as the slayer of Ma
jor McClung. . ' ! '"Â¦ â¢ ,
Captain of' Detectives Martin and At
torney Bradley reached tHe hotel a few
minutes after. Garnett was taken there
and, though. Ryan insisted that Mrs.
Coit should. identify/Garnett as the man
who shot Major McClung\in her pres
ence, this" important and necessary de
tail'of the'law was not accomplished.
' All requests that -Mrs. Coit be seen
were met â¢â¢ with a 1 refusal by Miss Ffi>s
rine Green, a, friend. The lady informed
Detective Ryan* that; by order of Dr. de
Vecchf, no one v \vas allowed to see' Mrs.
Coit. Attorney. -Bradley, however, did
not hesitate to enter Mrs. Coit's rooms
arid held a long' ! conversation with her.
Then he called in Captain of Detectives
Martin, and finally. Dr. Whitney was
sent for: to join In the consultation.
.: In tlie meantime Detective-Ryan and
.Garnett .waited in the corridor of the
hotel facing Mrs."; Coit's apartments.
'Garnett; was ignorant of the death of
Major McClung until 'he was Informed
by-a Call reporter of the fact, and he
simply replied, j"Qh, that Is all right."
Â¦ Garnett was in a very nervous condi
tion.- and Â¦started' 'to. speak and k then
would .answer.^ all questions by saying:

kept in the corridor, of the hotel, while.

BACK TO THE PALACE.
"There is one thing I want to deny
positively, and that is that I tried to
shoot Mrs. Coit. Â¦'. She has always been
my friend and is a distant relative. I
went to her rooms to apologize. After
the shooting, instead of trying to shoot
her.yl handed her the pistol and asked
her to shoot me. I have no ill feeling
and never did have against either her
or Major McClung."
H. W. Bradley made a statement of
his connection with the matter, say-
Ing:
"I am the attorney of Mrs. Coit and
the friend of Garnett. We became ac
quainted through the business affairs
of Mrs. , Colt, with which we both had
to do. A friend of Garnett came to my
house to-day and told me that Gar
nett wanted to see me and he took me
to him in Oakland. We had a little
talk over the affair and I advised him
to give himself up to-morrow. This he
had agreed to do. He told me his story,
which I have put into a short state
ment."
BRADLEY'S STATEMENT.
"I took a roijjm in a lodging-house on
Washington street and slept until this
morning. I went out and got a cup of
tea for breakfast and : while I was
drinking it I read the story of the
shooting In the newspapers.
"I determined to send for my friend
H. W. Bradley, with whom I had be
come â¢ acquainted while transacting
some of Mrs. Coit's business. I felt
that I could trust him. I got Mr.. Fon
taine to go to his home in Alameda
and bring him to Oakland. We got the
room in which I was arrested and
were talking the affair over when the
Oakland police stepped in. I had de
termined to give myself up to the San
Francisco police to-morrow and tell the
whole story.
As he said this he held out his left
hand, upon which there were a few
marks which might have been caused
by his hand becoming jammed against
the edge of a trigger guard.
"When I heard the. report," continued
Garnett, "and saw Major McClung fall
I knew that he had been shot by ray
revolver. I became very much excited
and handed the revolver to Mrs. Coit
and begged her to shoot me.
"Then I saw that everything was in
ah uproar and no one seemed to know
what, to do. I thought of calling a doc
tor, and it was I who brought one to
the aid of Major McClung.
"TWn I fled. I thought that it was
wealth and society against a poor man
and I determined to get away. I at
once took' a narrow-gauge route ferry
boat and boarded the Alameda train.
I found myself somewhere in Alameda
and took an electric car for Oakland.
It was about midnight when I got here.

ways carry, it was a self-cocking
weapon, and I always carried it ready
for action. There was a struggle, and
It was during this that the pistol-was
discharged. I did not intend to fire it",
and if you don't believe that it went oft"
during a struggle, look at my hand."
v, Soon after. the death occurred at the
sanatorium every possible effort was
made; to prevent the body from being
removed - to the Â¦ public morgue, as Is
, customary,. In cases of murder. The
.fact that the victim was a son-in-law
of, a late Coroner, Beverly Cole, was
given /consideration and courtesies :
asked. on that account. Coroner Lelandi
was isent f or and visited -the sanator- I
ium, 'where he had a conference with >
Dr. ; Shiels. After deliberation it was
decided to have the autopsy surgeon
perform the autopsy where the death
and, to then permit the Â¦ re-'
moval of the body to an undertaking

Â¦/District Attorney Byington was risked
last evening fas Â¦ to the statement â¢ se
cured Â¦ from Major McClung by Bond
and .Warrant Clerk Ward, and if it was
not theusual custom to inform a per
son from whom a "dying' statement",
was required that dissolution was im
minent. He said:
"It is not the province of the bond
and warrant clerk or of my office to in
form a Wounded person that he or she
is likely to die when the doctor in
charge of the case is present. In this
case Dr. Shiels was the best Judge as
to the condition of the wounded man,
and the bond and warrant clerk could
only state the law as to any statement
being voluntary.
r "I assume that the police have' se
cured statements from all parties con-;
"cerned in ; this matter and it does not
make any material difference as to the
value of this' statement." ' -â¢ >â¢
"I will certainly see that Garnett Is
charged with murder and that he is
prosecuted. ., All this .talk of an attempt
being made r to ! hush up 'the" case ' is ab
surd. As District Attorney 1 1 will see
AUTOPSY AT HOSPITAL.
"We went Into the room where Major
McClung was lying in bed. Dr. Shiels
told him who I was and what my offi
cial position was. Major McCiung then
asked me what I desired. I told him
that we wanted a statement from him
as to the shooting, which we would use
as a memorandum in case of his re
covery. I then said to him, 'But if you
are unfortunate and this injury should
prove fatal, this statement will be used
as evidence.' I further said: 'This state
ment to be a valid dying statement
should be voluntary on your part; do
you think you will recover?'
"Major McClung then said: 'The doc
tor knows more about that than I do.
Doctor, don't you think 1 have a fight
ing chance?'
"Dr. Shiels replied, 'Every man has a
fighting chance.' Major McClung then
said, 'Doctor, don't, you think I "will
get over this?' and Dr. Shiels replied,
'You are. shot very, badly. I will have
to wait.' I. then took the statement of
Major McClung."
When a "dying statement" is re
quired to be used as evidence It is nec
essary under the law to inform the
person from whom the statement is de
sired that his or her condition is such
that death is likely to take place and
that the statement must be voluntary
and with the knowledge that death is
probably near.
.According to the explanation made
by Bond and Warrant Clerk Ward, Maf
Jor McClung was not informed that his
injury \.was likely to- terminate fatally,
but .the. matter was left in doubt.
"I went up to the Waldeck Sanato
rium to secure a' statement from Ma
jor McClung. I met Dr. Shiels on en
tering the hospital. I told Dr. Shiels
that I desired to secure a statement
from the wounded man. Dr. Shiels
said to me, 'I think he is all in, but I
really don't like to tell him so. I have
intimated it to him a number of times,
but I fear the shock of telling him.'
USELESS AS EVIDENCE.
Bond and Warrant Clerk Ward was
asked last evening to explain why he
did not take what is known as a "dy
ing statement" from Major McClung,
and he said:
"My name is J. W. McClung. My
residence is at S57 Post street, in this
city. Last night about 5 o'clock I was
going out from a call when Mr. A. G.
Garnett came in. He, Garnett, was
asked to go away by Mrs. Lillian Coit.
He pulled a pistol and said he was
going to kill her. I teld him to go away,
and he said 'Gâ dâ you. Til kill you.'
Then he shot me once. He" was wildly
drunk. I was simply making a call.
This occurred in the Palace Hotel. I
hope to recover from this injury. I
can't add anything more.

"GEORGE FRANKLIN SHIELS,
"LOUIS H. WARD,
"CHARLES J. CODY."
Two hours 'before Major McClung
died a statement was secured from him
by Bond and' Warrant Clerk Louis H.
Ward, in the presence of Mrs. McClung,
Dr. G. P., Shiels and Detective C. J.
Cody. This was nc-t in the nature of "a
dying statement," and it is entirely val
ueless as evidence against Alexander
Cjarnett. '.':';
The statement made by Major Mc-
Clung is as follows:
"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 26, 1903.
Garnett told the prison-keeper that
he wanted a good soft bed, as he had
not slept much the previous night and
also asked for other conveniences. At
first he seemed disinclined to talk, but
finally answered all questions that
were put to him and even posed for a
flashlight photograph. He seemed to
be suffering from the after effects of
drink and his hand was unsteady. . He
was registered on the detinue book
and then placed in a cell on the felons'
side. Detective Ryan gave strict in
structons that the prisoner be care
fully watched, that he would have no
opportunity of attempting suicide.
McCLUNG'S STATEMENT.
Detective Ryan arrived with his pris
oner at the Hall of Justice shortly be
fore midnight and went immediately to
the City Prison. Garnett was searched
and about $18 was found in his posses
sion. Ryan is puzzled to know how he
secured this, but the prisoner 1 refused
absolutely t6 give him any information.
There were also three stickpins and a
lock of hair wrapped in tin foil. Three
photographs of . a woman were taken
from his wallet, but when asked who
she was Qarnett replied that he thought
he could have women friends without
telllng.people' about them. â¢
tectlve Ryan he had $20 in gold in his
pocket. . He was asked where he got the
money, and he replied that he had been
gambling: a few days ago and won the
coin, but refused to say where he won
the money.

\ BRAIN FOOD . lj
â¢ I Is of Little Benefit Unless It Is Di-
[ gested.
Nearly every one will admit that as a
I nation we eat too much meat and too
f little of vegetables and the grains.
For business men, office men and
clerks and, in fact, every one engaged
in sedentary or Indoor occupations,
grains, milk and vegetables are much
more healthful.
i | Only men engaged in a severe out-
.1 door manual labor can live on a heavy
{ meat diet and continue in health.
As a general rule, meat once a day
! is sufficient for all classes of men,
, women and children, and grains, fruit
and vegetables should constitute the
bulk of .food eaten.
But many of the most nutritious
foods are difficult of digestion and it is
of no use to advise brain workers to
| eat largely of grains and vegetables
i where the digestion is too weak to aa-
simllate them properly.
It is always best to get the best re-
sults from our food that some simple
; and harmless digestive should be tak-
j en after meals to assist the relaxed di-
i gestive organs, and several years' ex-
| perience has proven Stuart's DyspÂ«p-
[ sla Tablets to be a very safe, pleasant
and effective digestive and a remedy
which may be taken daily with the
best results.
! Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can hard-
ly be called a patent medicine, as they
do not act on the bowels nor any par-
ticular organ, but only on the food
! eaten. They supply what weak stom-
1 achs lack, pepsin diastase, and by
i stimulating the gastric glands ln-
1 crease the natural secretion of hydro-
chloric acid.
J People who make a daily practice of
taking one or two of Stuart's Dyspep-
; sia Tablets after each meal are sure to
; have perfect digestion, which means
perfect health.
; There is no danger of forming an ia-
I jurious habit, as the tablets contain
! absolutely nothing but natural diges-
tives; cocaine, morphine and similar
drugs have no place in a stomach med-
icine, and Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
are certainly the best known and most
popular of all stomach remedies.
Ask your druggist for a fifty-cent
package of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
and after a week's use note the Im-
provement In health, appetite and
nervous energy.

â¢CEW YORK, Nov. 26.â Charles
ThresboB, who is charged with having
written letters to President Roosevelt
complaining that an influential person
in governmental circles in Washington
had an electric battery attached to the
soles of his feet and so increased his
i nance to see the President, was sent
to Bc-llevue Hospital to-day for exam
ination as to his sanity. When ar
raigned before Magistrate Mayo the
prisoner said he was a "double Eon."
None of the letters contained any
threats.
Threshon, it was said by secret ser
vice officers, has twice before been ar
rested, once on January 6, 1S95, when
he sent a letter to President Cleveland
from Baltimore containing aJlusions to
the electric current which prevented
him from reporting to the President,
cud again in 1901, when he sent a simi
lar letter to President McKinley end

ir.aker, who came from Budapest two !
jears ago. For some time he has been j

nc-cted story. At the time of his arrest \
be had a ten-page typewritten letter J
addressed to the President in his pos- j
jessjen.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 26.â The an
nual report cf Governor Otero of New
Mexico makes the plea for the admis
sion of the Territory to statehood. The
report says that during the past year
the building of railroads has continued
with unabated vigor and capital has
made extensive investments.
The finances of the Territory are in
excellent condition and so are those of
the counties and cities, with a few. ex
ceptions. The Territory, as well as
most of the counties, i3 reducing its in
debtedness, while several counties are j
refunding their indebtedness at a j
rapid rate. The assessed valuation of |
New Mexico realty shows an increase i
of 51,000,000 over that of the preceding
year, but as the average assessment
rate is onlv about 20. per cent of the j
value the actual increase of valuation, ;
owing to the elimination of double as- ]
ssessments reported in former years, is i
almost J30.000.000. The collections for !
the past six months by the Territory j
exceeded that of the same period of ;
previous years by about $50,000. j

For some time shopkeepers on Mar
ket street have been the victims of im
pudent young thieves, who deliberate
ly rush into stores and even In the
presence of attendants take articles
from counters and show windows.
On Saturday night three youths ran
into Wichman's candy store, 754 Mar

sweets from the showcase. Determined
to put a stop to the thievery, P. F.
Wichman, brother of the proprietor of
the store, lay in wait last night and
about 9:30 o'clock, when the sidewalk
was crowded with pedestrians, one of
two youths rushed into the store,
opened the showcase and stole two
boxes of jujubes. /
Wichman ran from his hiding place,
but the thief was too quick for him and
succeeded in escaping to the street.
After a short but hot chase Wichman
caught, up with the youth and handed
him over to Policeman J. J. Farrell.
He was 'taken to the Hall of Justice,
where he gave his name as Thomas
Kerwin and said he was 16 years of age
and a teamster. He was booked on a
charge of petty larceny and released on
$5 bail. Kerwin had a box of the ju
jubes in his possession when arrested.

MICHAEL BURKE VICTIM
OF ILLUMINATING GAS
Sad Thanksgiving for His Family
When They Find Him Dead
in Bed.
Yesterday was a sad Thanksgiving
for the family of aged Michael Burke
of 240 Shotwell street. When # hls wife
went to his room to call him, that he
might get ready for dinner, she found
him dead in his bed.
The old man had been suffocated in
his sleep by illuminating gas, which
was escaping from a burner, the key of
which was open. He had retired on
Wednesday night at 8 o'clock, his usual
hour, to his room in the second, story,
which he occupied alone. Yesterday
morninghiswife went down town early
to purchase somethings needed for the
Thanksgiving dinner' Finding that he
had not made his appearance when she
returned she went to the room, opened
the door, and saw him lying in -bed in
a natural position, dead. Gas was es
caping from the burner and she turned
it off, but Mrs. Burke was so distracted
that she was unable to remember
whether the key was fully open or only
partly; so.
The deceased was a laborer 72 years
old and a native of Ireland. He leaves
a large family. They know of no rea
son for suicide, 'and believe 'that the
key was turned accidentally.

OF KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS
Mrs. Sheward was unusually cheerful
Wednesday when her husband left
home, and that afternoon she, too, left
Che hcruse. At 10 o'clock last night
Â¦when he returned he was told of his
â¢wife's absence, it having been supposed
that she had gone to the store to return
with him. Hoping that she would re
turn he waited until midnight and then
found on the pillow of his bed a note
from his wife in which she asked his
forgiveness and expressed her love for
him. Other notes to other relatives
were also found, all of them in the
lame tenor, but none-of them contained
even a hint "as to where Mrs. Sheward
had gone or what she intended to do.
Mr. Sheward at once notified the po
lice and a 'general alarm was sent out.
The officers of all the nearby towns
\Â»*<re also notified, especially those at
the beach resorts. All day to-day the
Â§><?arch for the missing woman has con
tinued, but without any result what.
Â«ver. Frnm the time that Mrs. Sheward
left her home no person who knows her
Is known to have seen her nor can any
person be found who has seen a woman
answering her description. The theory
cf the police is that in a fit of despond
ency due to the condit;on of her mind
she has committed suicide. Mr. She
â¢rd has engaged all the private de
tectives he can find and has offered a
reward for information as to his wife s
whereabouts.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 26.â Because
owing to the disordered condition of her
mind she feared that she would never
recover her health. Mrs. J. T. Sheward,
wife of a wealthy merchant, left her
home on West Adams street Wednes
day afternoon and not the slightest
trace of her has been fo-und *=lnee.
Since the birth . of her child five
months ago it has been necessary to
have a nurse with her constantly, for
her mind was affected and it was con-
Bidered unsafe to leave her *lone. A
week ago her condition Improved and
the vigilance of her relatives .v.as re
laxed. After a few days the nuiKc ieft,
the duty of looking after her devolving
upon two servants. To them she re
marked a few days ago that but for her
children she would go to the ocean and
drown herself.
Fpeci&l Dirratch to The Call
ROME, Nov. 26.â The anti-Austrian
demonstrations are assuming a crave
character and the Government has
stopped the delivery of all telegrams
sent in cipher. Throughout Rome the
cry is "Down with Francis Joseph! Let
us break the Triple Alliance!"
At the university the Austrian flag
was burned, amid wild scenes of enthu
siasm. At Genoa the demonstrators
succeeded in reaching the Austrian
consulate, where thty shouted the most
hostile crlea.
The demonstrations result from the
prohibition by the Austrian govern
ment of the institution of a free Ital
ian university at Innsbruck. . The
Roman police gathered In large num
bers around the Austrian embassy and
the Austrian consulate, against which
the efforts of the demonstrators 7?ere
directed. The crowds even invaded
the public promenade in the gardens of
the Pincio and compelled the band to
play the ' royal march, which was
greeted with great applause.
At the university the students, to the
number of about 1000, held an indigna
tion meeting and then decided to make
a demonstration in the streets of the
.city. The police, however, were pre
pared for this and as soon as the stu
dents emerged they were attacked and
compelled to re-enter the university.
The students showed their indignation
by breaking the windows and furniture
of the class rooms. The authorities
have decided to close the university
until order has been restored.
An anti-Austrian demonstration Was
held at Turin, where the demonstrators
rang the bells on the university, brok?
the windows and benches and exploded
firecrackers, producing a slight panic.
Similar demonstrations were held, at
Milan, Parma, Padua and Genoa.
The Government ha3 determined to
suppress these demonstrations at any
cost, as it wishes to avoid complaint
from the Austrian government^
MINNEAPOLIS. Nov. 26.â Millers re
port an extraordinary increase in the
flour export trade with Japan. In Sep
tember the trade more than doubled in
size. The tremendous increase is be
lieved to be significant of prepara
tions for war with Russia. While the
purchase? have been made through the
ordinary' channels, it is believe that the
Mikado's Government has Inspired
them.
LONDON, Nov. 26.â The Shanghai
correspondent of the Daily Telegraph

TROOPS TO FIGHT RUSSIA.
A dispatch received here from Vladi
vostok notes the general subsidence of
war talk in the Japanese press, and
says the Japanese Consul General in
Korea has issued a proclamation to
quiet the alarm of his compatriots.
A telegram from Port Arthur says
the Russian torpedo-boat built at Port
Arthur was launched yesterday, mak
ing the twelfth torpedo-boat built at
Port Arthur. The first six of these ves

footing.
The Novoe Vremya in a recent article
declared that if the British succeeded
in carrying out Â¦Â¦ their plans Thibet
would be in their hands, as they al
ways would be In a position to threat
en Lhassa, and if they gain control of
the holy land of Thibet the 500,000,000
of Buddhists would regard Great Brit
ain as being the most powerful country
in the world. The Novoe Vremya adds:
"While it is impossible for the weak
Thibetans to prevent the British cross-
Ing the Himalayas, it is quite possible
for others to compel the British to stop
by creating a slight diversion in some
direction disagreeable t6 the British
politicians."
No specific information has been re
ceived here concerning the reported re
occupation of Haicheng, thirty miles
north of Newchwang, by Russian
troops, but it is regarded as quite prob
able. The town is close to the Moukden-
Newchwang railroad. It Is explained
that the whole country Is occupied by
Russian troops for the purpose of pro
tecting the railroad workmen and the
Chinese population from the depreda
tions of robbers. The officials here are
at a loss to understand why the possi
ble entry of Russian troops into Hai
cheng has been made the occasion for
alarming reports.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 26.â The
newspapers here regard the British ex
pedition to Thibet as an attempt to stir
up a movement in China, under cover
of which the powers will increase their
spheres of influence, and they appeal to
China not to permit the empire to be
deprived of Russian intervention, which
saved it on other occasions.
Some one sent in a still ala/m and the

"I was coming down Twelfth street
and just as I 'reached the corner of

gasoline feed pipe, but it did.not work,
so I ran the rig up to an iron pole and
then tried again to snut off the gaso

A moment after he left the aijto the
fire reached the gasoline tank and the
cover was blown off, scattering the.

Tait been working at the machine when
this happened he. would have been se
verely burned and perhaps killed.
Tait. who is but 16 years old. told
this story:
The fire had gained too much head
way, however, and after getting his
hands J severely burned in handling the
hot stop-cocks and having his eyebrows
and eyelashes singed off and his face
blistered by the whirling flames, Tait
was forced to leave the machine to its
fate.
Olin W. Tait, who resides at 1311
Fourth avenue, had a narrow escape
from death this afternoon while driv
ing Dr. N. H. Chamberlain's automo
bile on Twelfth street, near Jackson.'
A faulty feed pipe from the gasoline
tank to the burner burst, and before
Tait could jump from the machine he
was surrounded by ilames, which burst
from under the seat. He retained his
presence of mind, however, and after
an ineffectual attempt to shut off the
flow of the Inflammable fluid he ran the
automobile against one of the Oakland
Transit Company's iron poles and, get
ting out, tried to close the valve at the
tank.

thieves who was arrested near Lost
Cabin several days ago and brought
to jail here. Fearing that the report
of an intended attack was triw Sheriff
Webb swore in more than one hundred
deputies to defend the Jail and to-night
the Courthouse square is j surrounded

before to-morrow morning, as the Hole
in the Wall is seventy miles from town
and the gang was reported riding

The Hole In the Wall has been a
celebrated resort for desperadoes and
during the past two or three years
gangs have congregated there. It is
known positively that when the news
of O'Day's capture â¢ spread bad men
from all parts of Central Wyoming

purpose of laying a plan for nis release.
Some of these men captured the stolen

When told that his wife's bofly had
been buried, Patterson was very much
grieved and expressed a wish to see her
once more. The remains may now be
disinterred from Mountin View Ceme
tery, where they rest, and sent to Sac
ramento, at which place it was first in
tended to bury them.
He told his story as follows this aft
ernoon at the home of his sister-in-law,
Mrs. Jennie Hammond of 2414 Sixth
street:
'.'I remember going to the telephone
after my wife's death.' I could not get
the party I wanted and went to East
Berkeley, inte'nding' to telephone in
structions. I found the telephone of
fice closed and then started for Oak
land. I have a hazy recollection of
getting on 1 a car and being whirled
away into space somewhere, but that is
all I renwmber. This morning I seemed
to come back to my senses with a
start. I was in a strange place and a
man told me it was somewhere in Oak
landâaway out somewhere from the
center of town.
Frederick C. Patterson, the man who
dropped out of sight while arranging
for the funeral of his wife and did not
return .even to mourn at . her bier,
found his way back to-day to the house
that was the scene of his bereave
ment. Patterson says his mind has
been a blank since his wife died in his
arms Saturday evening, and he does
not remember anything that happened
after going to the telegraph office to
arrange with Mayor Clark of Sacra
mento for her burial. For four days
he wandered about, not knowing or re
alizing anything until the light came
back into, his mind this morning on the
streets of Oakland.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Nov. 26. .
The people from Oakland board a
cur at the corner of Fourteenth street
and .Broadway and pay 5 cents fare.
They are then deposited at the corner
of Fortieth street and Broadway, where
they take the Berkeley train, and when
the conductor comes through to col
lect the tickets they pay an additional
30 cents, though they ride a very small
fraction of the distance of the Berke
ley passengers. The car that starts
from Fourteenth street and Broadway
is labeled Key Route in no uncertain
letters, but an additional fare Is
charged nevertheless. The people of
Oakland feel that as long as Key Route
cars are run into Oakland they should
be given the same privileges as the
passengers from Berkeley and that the
new system has been in operation long
enough to have permitted the manage
ment to give them equal privileges
with the people of Berkeley. The ac
tual terminus of the Key Route is in
Oakland and the Oakland franchises
were secured without* trouble, while
there has always; been some difficulty*
over the Berkeley franchises.
The twenty-minute service of the new
route will go into effect on Saturday
morning. The first boat from San
Francisco will leave at 6:10 o'clock and
then every twenty minutes until 7 p.
m., after which boats will leave at 8,
9. 10, 11:10 and 12:30 o'clock.
From Berkeley the first train will
leave at 6 a. m. and then every twenty
minutes until 6:55 and then every hour
from that time on until 11:05, which is
the last train.
The time from Fourteenth street and
Broadway, Oakland, is the same as
from Berkeley. . . .
When the people of Berkeley board
one of the Key Route trains they pay
10 cents to the conductor, who gives
them a check or. ticket. This ticket is
later collected back by the conductor
after the train has left Oakland.
The people of Oakland are beginning
to wonder what benefit they derive
from the new Key Route ferry sys
tem. It is now nearly a month since
the new ferry started and while the
patrons of the route that ride from
Berkeley are paying 10 cents for a trip
to San Francisco, the people from Oak
land are paying 15 cents, the new route
taking advantage of the extra 5 cents
from those who have curiosity enough
to want to try the new system.

MISSOULA. Mont., Nov. 26.â Word
was sent to Fort Missoula late this
afternoon by Major Smead. Indian
agent on the Flatheaa Reservation,
that the Indian police are unable to
cope with Joe Morrigeau and his band
of cowboys, who have 1500 head of stock
on the reservation and refuro to pay
the grazing tax. A request was made
to send troops to the scene of the
trouble with orders to run off the Mor
rigeau band.
Major Torrey, Captain ', Maxle and
fifty men, on orders from Washington,
were ordered to the scene at once.
The hurry march gave rise to ail
sorts of rumors, among which is one
that a Deputy Sheriff has been shot
and two or three Indian policemen
wounded.
Morrigeau is in the Little Bitter Root,
forty miles from the railroad.
The troops will be compelled to march
overland the distance named.

CHICAGO, Nov. 26.â Cars were run
to-night by the Chicago City Railway
for the first time after dark since the
strike was called two weeks ago.
While the struggle was on, the service,
operated under police protection, was
abandoned each day shortly after 4
o'clock, in order to avoid any possible
attack that might be made by strike
sympathizers under cover of darkness.
The entire sj'stem was put in operation
to-day and there was little evidence of
the struggle that came to a peaceful
ending yesterday.
When the strikers reported for duty
this morning all of them, with the ex
ception of fifty-nine, were given work.
Of the fifty-nine men whom the com
pany refused to reinstate, fifty-three
were train-service employes and six
were members of the cable splicers'
union. These men. It Is asserted by
the officers of the railway, were guilty
of disorderly conduct during the dis
pute, and, according to the terms of
the settlement, were ncft entitled to re

method as in swinging for the head,
except, of course, that the "circle" you
describe takes a slightly downward
instead of upward curve. Swing for
the heart with the right, for the wind
with the left. When swinging for the
kidneys, across the small of the back
(a blow that should never be employed
in a friendly bout between beginners),
use your right, as the other man will
be standing with his left side slightly
forward and the email of the back will
be more exposed and more easily reach
ed from that side.
A swing for the face Is guarded by
raising the right or left hand (accord
tng to which side the swing comes
from), so that the arm from nst to el
bow is perpendicular (hand. uppermost,
of course), the glove to one side of the
lead being at about the height of the
â¢ar." Or, if you prefer; you can usually
ruard a swing that is not too swift or,
quiring in every circumstance to be
used merely as a counter. In both
hooks and swings every thin? depends
on the soeed and accuracy of the blow
and on the power of putting the force
and weight of the body Into it. Re
member, when !Â¦ speak of "putting the
force and weight of the body" into a
blow, I do not mean that, In a friendly
bout, you shall strike with all that
strength. But the power should be
there, used in moderation, and capable
of .far greater use if necessary. In
the hook the body movement is given
more prominence than in the swing,
and in the "jolt" most of the force
-of the blow depends on the co-operation
of â¢ the-body. - Â¦ â
This brings me to the "jolt'; itself.
A. swing is delivered with the arm
stretched almost to full extent; a hook
with the. arm bent at an. angle 'of about
90 degrees. /A jdlt Is delivered .'with the
arm doubled at an. angle of almost 180
degrees, the. elbow' out from.' the body.
It Is always a close-Quarter blow.
Holding your right arm elbow down,
hand up, lead for your sparring part
ner's Jaw,, moving the hand less than
twelve" inches in delivering the blow,
but rising on the right toe and throw
tng"the right Bhoulder forward to lend
additional reach and power to the lead.
In. jolting with the left, rise on the
right toe again (keeping the left foot
flat on the ground in both instances),
and bringing forward the left shoulder
with the blow. s
The shoulder and arm . should not
move straight forward, but with a
slightly circular motion. This puts
more force Into the Jolt.
A POPULAR American author whose skill as a ro
manticist has been well established has, in his latest
book, ventured out of the realms of story-telling and
essayed a little voyage upon the sea of social economy.
After bewailing the disappearance of the typical American
frontiersman of the '30's and satisfying himself that with,
the buckskin and powder horn there departed also the back
bone of American nationality, the author makes the asser
tion that Canada is becomingâthe only haven for our
latter day backwoodsmen, and that we are annually losing
to our â¢ sister, commonwealth on the north an appalling
number of the flower of our citizens.
"Canada once lost one-fifth of her population to the
United States," says the amateur sociologist. "She is re
gaining much of it to-day, because she still has a west arid
we have none. There is systematic, deliberate and highly
differentiated effort going on toward the influencing of this
American immigration. To offset this we have nothing to
offer except^ the incoming "stream of city dwellers from
Europe and 1 the possible policy of national irrigation, subject
always to the dubious methods of American, politics. Gaze
once more, if you like, upon the picture of the old West and
the new." . . .^ . ,
The note of warning cannot be taken as seriously as it
would were it to come from some competent student of
American affairs, whose judgment would not be tinged
with a romantic affection for the things of the past. True
it is that thousands of Americans have taken up homes in
the great Northwest, and that British Columbia is being
subdued by the ax of the American Tio less than that of the
Canadian. Thousands also have invaded Mexico and now
practically control the mining interests of that country.
Other Americans are building railroads in .China, working
diamond mines in South Africa, raising coffee in Central
America. The same spirit which moved our ancestors, the
frontiersmen, to conquer the Ohip Valley in the first decade
of the nineteenth century is now, in. the. first half, of the
twentieth, bringing the world to our doors through the
ships of the seven seas. Â¦ ' . Â¦ <
It always has been that in" the history of our country
there are those restless ones whose joy in- life lies in
breasting the unsubdued' forces of nature. The forests arid
rugged mountains are theirs by choice; when the forests
disappear and the mountains are girdled by railroads they
put their~1iousehold into a covered wagon arid seek those
places where. there" is no smoke on the horizon. They are
the folk "who moved from Tennessee to Missouri, from
Missouri to Nebraska, from, Nebraska to Oregon arid now
to Canada. Their â¢ departure i is neither a menace to the
continued welfare of the United States no* an indication

3. The "Jolt."
A fellow in Clark University has made the astounding
announcement that no American, enjoying the varied ex
perience that comes with 3 years of age, is safe from
Cupid's darts. This particular investigator has carried his
curious inquiry to the point of his own conviction that
heart susceptibility in a woman reaches its maturity at 22
years and in a man at 24 years. It is very evident that
somebody has been telling the secrets of Oakland.
is far more powerful than the Btraight
arm blow, but (on the same principle
of a straight line being the shortest
distance between two points) it is also
a much slower blow. If your sparring
partner led a straight blow for your
face at precisely the same Instant that
you swung for his face, and if neither
of you moved the head, his blow would
land before yours. For that reason the
swing should always be used as a
counter and not as a lead. Your an
tagonist leads for you with a straight,
blow. You block or duck his blow and
counter with a ewing. In such a case
your swing stands a good chance of
landing on him. But if you swing for
him before he leads he will have time
to send in a straight blow and to block
or avoid your swing. There is another
and still more cogent reason why you
should only use the swing as a counter.
WJie> you swing you leave one side of
your body and face practically un
guarded. Hence it is necessary to re
frain from Bjyinging until your oppo
nent has other work to attend to,
which will render him unable to take
advantage of the opening. Let him'
lead, therefore, before you swing. This
is worth remembering.

MR. WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST is counted
out. That fortnight in which he was to "write for
Democracy its brightest page is up, and the said
page has not got as far as the proof galley. His issue on
Cuban reciprocity ended in all the Democrats \ but ten
voting with the administration, and nbwhe is out with" an
other on the isthmus of Panama. - L
Very naturally he sides with the degenerate hybrids of
Bogota, and against the more progressive and enlightened
folks. of the isthmus. -But it is time for Mr.' Hearst to let
canal affairs alone. When the McKinley administration
was using every resource for the Nicaragua route, and was
threading its way through the maze of international issues
raised by the three sovereignties that had to be. dealt "with
on that line, the Hearst papers daily beset the President
and denounced him for" offenses that existed in a perfetid
imagination. They appealed to every sentiment that could
be moved to oppose the. President, and attacked him per
sonally with that venom which folldwed him to the moment
of his assassination. We suspected then and believe now
that Mr. Hearst was actuated by no higher motive than the
promoting of interests antagonistic to any canal. But he
succeeded in obstructing and was instrumental in wasting
years of time, wh?n the interests of the world required the
prompt building of the canal.
When McKinley turned to the Panama project, wisely
seeking an alternative to the Nicaragua route, Mr. Hearst
used the publicity at his command to obstruct on that line.
Now he is putting more blue" bosh on the market, and while
the tongue is the tongue- of Hearst, the song it sings is
that of the combinations which are willing to put up mil
lions to beat any canal. He mourns because in the eyes of
Colombia, "We seem now not a great, free and liberty
loving republic, but a robber power, adopting for our rule
of conduct the brutal maxim that might makes right. In
their eyes we arc lost to all perception of justice and senti
ments of chivalry and deaf to every appeal that is not ad
dressed to our material interests." \.
If Mr. Hearst desires to look well in the eyes of the
special gang of revolutionary bandits who at this moment
rule Colombia, he is at liberty to go down there wrought
upon by a fellow feeling, and take pot luck with the tyrants
who have ruled the isthmus only to rob it.
Instead of human liberty suffering by the separation of
Panama, it is advanced, and made more secure. It is Mr.
Hearst's opinion that the Spooner act requires that the
President return to the old policy of walking in a circle,
and never getting anywhere, by turning to Nicaragua and
making canal treaties with Costa Rica and Nicaragua. The
Spooner act says that if the President cannot get permis
sion from Colombia to dig the Panama Canal, in a reason
able time, he shall try the other route. Â¦ Because Colombia
had sovereignty of the isthmus when the Spooner act
passed the name was used. But suppose that a revolu
tionary congress, like the one that wiped out New Granada
and installed Colombia in its place, had meantime met and
wiped out Colombia and called it "Hearstom," or "Dirty
sally," would. Mr. Hearst, contend that ''the President would
have no power to treat with it because the name had been
changed? : . . ., .â ... , :
The thing to be dealt with is the sovereignty of* the
isthmus. We could not dig a canal there in the midst of
constant civil war. Therefore, a new sovereignty having
appeared called the republic of Panama, strictly according
to the Spooner act we deal with it, we make a canal treaty,
and we propose to keep the isthmus from having revolu
tionary cat fits long enough to enable us to dig the canal,
let the water in and start the world's commerce flowing
through the new channel. This may all seem very sad to
Mr. Hearst, but we venture the prediction that if it come
tp a vote in Congress the best element in the Democracy
will sustain the administration

I have seen Tom Sharkey, who was
one of the heaviest hitters among the
pugilists of his day. start a swing from
behind his back (instead of at his side)
and send the blow around â¢ with such
terrific force that, missing his man
(who jumped back out of: reach), he
whirled half-way about and. fell with
a crash to the ground, merely through
the impetus of his own "blow. ThaÂ£ is
not boxing. It is not <:ven clever'slug
gins. It is blind brute force. Many a
man on whom Sharkey chanced to land
such swlnps went "down and out"
from the fearful Impact. But many
more pugilists avoided Sharkey's wild
swing: and bull-like rushes, and ere the
aggressor could recover himself landed
a succession of lightning-like blows on
his face and body and "got away" un
scathed.
Terry McGovern," who was the typi
cal "whirlwind fighter," said to me
once:
I never Fwing. It leaves a man too open,
The chances egainst ltu success are too big,
I use hook*, but not swings.
The "hook" is merely a short-arm
swing. It used to be called a "half
hook" or "half-swing." In a hook thÂ£
arm Is not lowered or drawn back, but
comes around toward the objective
face or body, with fore arm and upper
arm about at right angles to each
other. The arm thus in shape and mo
tion is not unlke a grass hook or sickle.

"Say," said a well-known attorney
occupying offices in the Claus Spreckels
building, "did you ever stand for a mo

initiated to find a way to get through
the new circular machine that mas
â¢Werades as a door to this building?
Well. It's worth while. When she's
whirling it's easy, but when in repose
a person has as much right to think he
can enter his home by diving through
the spokes \Of his turbine j windmill as
he has to guess the right way through
this new-fangled thing if he hasn't
ssen it in action. You should have
been there when on a recent occasion I
was Inside of the building approaching
the door and noticed a man with ortho
dox pastoral whiskers enmeshed in the
mysterious entrance. They probalbly
don't have these doors up in his county.
At any rate the man looked as wild
eyed as thoueh he had been inveigled
Into a mirror maze and couldn't get
out. His hands tightly grasped the
hand-rail in front of him and there he
stuck, fast. He had got in somehow,
but. I'll bet he didn't know how him
self.- and the boy on the burning deck
wasn't a marker to him for sticking.
As. I entered, my cell I attempted to
push the thing around and release the
prisoner, but-. Uncle Jasper, seeing
something was about to happen, took
no chances and began pulling back. I
-was heavier than he was, and finally
got things going my way.
"Jasper, selng It move, became pas
sive, and went where fate and the door
willed. I thought I had finally done
him a service by getting him Inside the
building, but Instead of stepping out of
the segment when he was Inside he
kept on going around. I don't know
whether he . was simply dazed or
whether he really liked it, but honest
sure, I saw the man wind around in
that thing for two full circles until
finally I became ashamed of watching
his discomfiture and left. I hope he
was finally whirled in, however."

INSANITY IN CALIFORNIA.
WHEN the first ce'nsus of California was taken, in
1851, there were but six registered insane, or 1 to
every 21,000 inhabitants. In- the report of the
State hospitals for 1902 the number of insane under public
charge is placed at 5276 persons, or 1 to every 260 residents
of the State. According to these figures California has the
largest percentage of insane of any State in the Union. New
Vork, with the ratio of 1 to 330, has* the nearest approach
to our record in demented persons. Our State, which is
proudly vaunted as the land of fruit and flowers, seems also
by this token to be the land of lunatics'
However, there is no occasion for our Eastern friends to
class lunacy along with the much advertised bubonic plague
and. the California earthquake as a deterrent to prospective
colonists. The most erudite physicians do not dare to make
the assertion that dementia is contagious. IS10 germ of
neurosis has, yet been discovered to have made its habitat
in our atmosphere. We do not, as a State, lay claim to lead
ing the pace that kills. On the other hand, our remarkable
percentage of insane patients must be traced to that very
army of homeseekers which is yearly pouring over our bor
ders in ever increasing numbers to find ah abiding place in
California.
It may not seem fair to attribute our seeming mental
weaknesses to those who have come here to be our fellow
citizens, but statistics cannot be gainsaid. John" W. Rob
ertson, M..D., superintendent of the Livermore Sanitarium,
in a pamphlet upon "The Prevalence of Insanity in Califor
nia," points out the fact that the foreign born, who constitute
25 per cent of our. population, provide 57 per cent of our
asylum inmates. Dr. Robertson goes farther and shows
by figures that out of the native born Californians, consti
tuting 50 per cent of our total population, only 17 per cent
of the insane are furnished. That part of the population
born in other States sent 26 per cent of the total number of
the demented to the hospitals. A native Indian is almost
unknown as an inmate of an asylum. ' ... ,
This preponderance of foreign born and of transmontane
insane which serves to bring the record of our State hospi
tals up to such alarming proportions is accounted for by
Dr. Robertson in a very plausible manner. Immigrants
from the Old World .have already a tendency to dementia,
owing to the very fact of their removal from the land of
their birth to one which must of necessity bring about a
radical change in their mode of living and a consequent re
action 7 on their mental economy. Further, they are usually
of the poorer class, and financial disaster or bodily hurt be
fr-lling them in a strange continent tends to mental unbal
ance^ The same conditions;! hold good to a lesser degree
with re/pect to Eastern, settlers, for in their case a large
number seek California Sunder the spur of a malignant dis
ease, and too many "bring with them a predilection to in
sanity. 'Â¦Â¦â¢
An anarchist, duly commissioned and fully resolved to

Old Adage Exemplified.
The old saying that 'there Is many a
slip twixt the cup and the lip' Is about
as truthful a one as any handed down
by the wiseacres of the days of yore "
said "Cupid" Danforth a few days ago
during a lull in the marriage liqense
business. "It, was exemplified here this
morning," he added.
"Just after I opened the b.Tice a young
couple came In. They bore all the ear
marks of lovers, and every move of the
girl showed that she thought a whole
lot of the young- fellow. Though It was
evident that he was Just as hard hit,
he was a little bit more reserved, and
looked quite embarrassed when she
called him 'darling' in such a tone that
I could hear it. .
"Well, he walked ud to the desk and
gave his name, and age and also that of
the blushing girl. Without looking up
I then asked If either of them had been
married before. A verv low but de
cisive 'no' name from the lips of the
girl, but the young man remained si
lent. Surprised, I raised my eyes and
said to him 'Were you?'
"He hesitated Just a moment, and
then answered 'yes.' I thought the
young lady would faint when she heard
it, but she recovered herself and cried
out in an agonized voice. 'Oh, Will!'
Then without another word she walked
out of the office. The young fellow
started to follow her, but returned 'to
the desk for the document. I completed
the license, gave It to him and he
dashed out of the office like mad. Two
hours later he came back, handed me
back the document, and in a voice
choked with emotion said, 'Cancel this,
please.' " <j.*~ -'.
A Talented Artist.
Edwin Lord Weeks, an American
painter and writer, whose work 13
largely associated with India and Per
sia, died in Paris recently, being about
50 years old. He was a native of Bos
ton, and a student of French schools in
art; and while for some years main
taining a studio in New York, and ex
hibiting at the National Academy of
Design, he was essentially European
in his character and work. He luxu
riated In the rich and various color
of oriental life, and his studio in the
Tenth-street building was a bewilder
ing bazaar of fabrics and bric-a-brac,
scented with attar-of-roses. He Dalnted
with masterly cleverness the
which he loved, and was personally a
charming cosmopolite.' He had exhib
ited his painting* all over Europe, and
everywhere got honors. He was a
chevalier of the Legion of Honor, an
officer of the order of St. Michael of
Bavaria; won the grand diploma of
honor at Berlin In 1S91; was given first
class medals at Paris In 1883. Munich
and Dresden in 1397; received the gold
medal of the Philadelphia Art Club
in 1891, and in 1S96 was given a special
medal and prize at the Empire of In
dia exhibition in London. Paintings of
his are in the Corcoran gallery a;,,
Washington and the Pennsylvania
Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia.
Other honors he had; and he wrote a
large number of articles for magazines,
among them Harper's, and published
two books. "From the Black Sea
Through Persia and India." and "Epi
sodes of Mountaineering." In one of
his mountain traversing expeditions he
was lost sight and hearing of so long
that he was supposed to have been
killed; as it turned out, his compan
ion was killed.
ter sport In the Northern and North
western States as tobogganing: In Can
ada, says "Country Life" In America's
Christmas Annual. Where the snow
fall, as In Oregon. Nevada. Michigan
and Wisconsin, lies on the ground for
weeks together to the depth of several
feet skees virtually become the life
preservers of the inhabitants. They
furnish the only means by which the
mail carriers can reach the inaccessible
and outlying mountain districts of the
Rockies. Skees differ radically from
the 'Canadian or Indian snowshoe. They
are about seven feet long, four inches
broad and taper from an Inch thick at
the center to three-quarters.
The Western skee-runner r0n cover
on an average about four to eight miles
an hour, going up and down hill. Down
hill an experienced runner can let him
self go. but for a beginner It would be
like turning on the clutch valve of an
automobile without knowing where the
break was.
Skees were first known to have been
used In the thirteenth century. Eight
centuries passed before the trappers,
lumbermen and woodchoppers of
America learned the vast superiority
of the skee over the Canadian snow
shoe. In a century more the latter will
be looked at In museums as the clumsy
implement of the bygone age.
THE EUROPEAN MAN.
WHAT is the matter with Europe? In France there
are more deaths than births. The population is
not increased by immigration, and is quite
rapidly declining. When population begins going down
hill it will reach the bottom some time, and at the present
rate the end of the, .French people may be figured with
accuracy, as to the time when there will be no more French
men in France. '
That is the pessimistic view of it, but things do not al
ways justify that view nor vindicate its hopeless mathe
matics. Malthus resorted to mathematics, and proved that
the world's population would come to an end, or at least
retrograde and countermarch, to meet the food supply,
because the mouths to eat it increased faster than the food.
Time has destroyed the Malthusian theory, and it may
obsolete the pessimistic view of the French race. It is
quite forgotten that the same idea, once prevailed about the
population of Germany. After the exhausting wars of
Frederick the Great, especially the Prussians seemed to
lapse and show plain signs of exhaustion and loss of vigor.
But Father Jan started his organization of Turners, incited
the young to outdoor life and athletic exercise, and the
Germans of to-day are as vigorous as any race, and the
population is seeking outlets by colonization. France may
have a like future. â¢ *
The greatest surprise in vital matters is the- recent con
clusion that the English have deteriorated and degenerated
physically. We have been so in the -habit of respecting
the brawn of the beefeating British that this arouses inter
est on this side of the water. Already the English press is
filled with reasons for the degeneration which all. seem to
admit is a fact. One writer traces it to the excessive use
of soap; others attribute it to the decline of agriculture and
the separation of mm from ..he soil. .We are inclined to
think that this has something in it. The mines, mills and
cities are hardly capable of furnishing as robust men and
women as the farm. The subject has attracted the attention
of Parliament, and a royal commission is proposed to ex
amine into it and suggest remedies.
The decline of the population of France and the decay
in vigor of that of England may have effects far beyond the
borders of both countries. These two causes may seriously
disturb the world's equilibrium, disorder its markets, re
lccate its productive and consumptive power, and change
entirely its commercial geography. The United States may
well rejoice in her strength, which is the strength of her
people. If soap destroy vigor, ours would be gone, for
we use more of it per capita than any other people in the
world. We have plenty to eat, and an appetite for it. A
majority of us live out of doors most of the time, and we
take the- European immigrants, small in body through gen
erations of underfeeding, and make them look like stallfcd
oxen.
A woman resident of Sacramento, having in the course
of litigation been declared dead by the courts, has appealed
to the Supreme Court of the United States to declare her
alive. From what we know of the capital city the simple
announcement of the lady's residence there should be
enough to declare her alive in anv court in the land.

This has been the custom of the asso

many who would otherwise not have
any Thanksgiving dinner have been
fed. Yesetrday the poor, the sick and
the homeless flocked to the rooms of
the association and received the food
for their dinner of thanks. Among the
women who took part in this good work
were: Mesdames W. O. G. W. Prescott,
J. F. Merrill, J. Spruance, E. T. Allen,
J. L. Martel, A. R. Baldwin, S. P. Tug

sauce and other good things to remind
them that the people of this city

not forget their unfortunate condition
in being inmates of a public institu

A similar repast was served to â¢ the
951 inmates of the Almshouse, where
1100 pounds of American fat and jutcy
turkeys were cooked and set before
those whose misfortunes compelled
them to become wards of the city. In
addition to the turkey dinner fruits
and nicknacks from the confectionery
were served for the noon meal. The
poor of the Almshouse heartily joined
in returning thanks to the bounteous
offering given them by the thoughtful
ness of Superintendent Kelly, who saw
to It that all were made happy.
Many persons, taking advantage of
the fine weather, visited the park,
where a special . concert was given.
Others went to the Cliff House, lolled
in the sands, watched the seals and
waves and enjoyed to their hearts' con
tent the sunshine with which the day
was blessed.
Still more found recreation . and
amusement at the various playhouses,
where special matinees were given.
The whole city population in one way
or another. awoke to the fact that they
had reason to be thankful, and turned
out to make the most of the beautiful
day.
"LITTLE MOTHERS' Â» GOOD TIME.
Children Prove Value of a Domestic
Training.
Probably no prettier nor more inter
esting sight could have been seen
yesterday than the pretty, natty,
well-behaved members of the Lit
tle Mothers' Training School as
they sat down to a wondrous
Thanksgiving day repast at the bright
quarters, 940-942 Harrison street. And
what also was of great interest was the
fact that the turkey dinner, with Its
salads and other dainties and English
plum ! pudding, . had been cooked and
prepared by the "Little" Mother's," tots
averaging from 8 to about 15 years of
age. *
The "Little Mothers" learn so much
domesticity at the training-school that
they are almost as independent in the
kitchen as they are in the arranging of
rooms and the making of beds and
tending to infants not so much younger
than themselves.
The dinner tables, spick and span,
covered with spotless white tablecloths
and bright with good crockery and
well-polished silverware, were laid by
the "Little Mothers," for even that ac
complishment comes within the range
of their tuition. ; <;\ I

dren under the direction of Miss D.
Swett and Mrs.SC. Matlock is set forth

followed. Each one called upon to say

For' many seasons the thoughtful
members of the Young Women's Chris
tian Association have sought -out the
needy, the destitute and the sick and
have given appropriately in all cases.
With the co-operation of friends, of the
association and aided by the liberality
of leading merchants of the city, much
more has been done than if the mem
bers of the association had beenj com
pelled to depend upon their own indi
vidual resources altogether.
Each family was provided with . a
turkey or chicken, ham, beef, bacon,
flour, tea, coffee, sugar, bread, butter,
vegetables, rice, canned and fresh
fruit, cheese and mince pie and track
ers.
In acknowledgment of the good
deeds of the ladies of the association
the recipients showed - the -greatest
gratitude. , Among those who took an
active part in the generous work were
Mrs. W. O. Gould, Mrs. G. W. Pres

Special Dispatch to The Call
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 26.â The con
templated erection of two more crack
er factories In Portland has lent an ad
ditional complication to the approach-
Ing war of prices with, which the
cracker trust threatens to wipe out ita
small competitors after January 1.
Owing to the uncertain condition' of
cracker affairs in the Northwest Just
now, every effort is being made to keep
the plans secret, but it is known that
one of the new plants will be in the
combine,. the other outside of It.
One of the new factories which will
turn out candy and crackers will be
run in part by local capital. Two of
the leading, stockholders are Colin -K.
Harbaugh, a wealthy real estate man
of this city, and C. X. Larrabee, a cap
italist of Fair Haven, Wash. The
other plant will be put up by the
Standard Biscuit Company of San
Francisco. When Phil I. Jacoby, the
president of the company, was In Port
land a few weeks ago he selected a site
for tW"^ factory, and on his return here
next week will probably order active
building operations to begin. The
Standard Biscuit Company works in
harmony with the Pacific Coast Biscuit
Company in its njice arrangements.
In the meantime the several com
panies in the combineâ rthe * Pacific
Coast Biscuit Company, American Bis
cuit Company, Standard Biscuit Com
pany and the Seattle Companyâ are
maintaining the schedule. The cause
of all the trouble, the Mutual Biscuit
Company, a ' co-operative concern
formed by San Francisco retal grocers,
Is still doing business in the interior,
bound by no rule, but getting all the
trade it can.

At the First Congregational Church
the congregation united with that of
the First Unitarian Church in a com
mon service. Rev. George C. Adams of
the Congregational church preached
St. Mary's Cathedral was draped in
mourning robes according to a time
honored custom. Each Thanksgiving a
requiem mass is held for the repose of
the departed members of the Young
Men's Union. Rev. J. B. Hannagan
acted as celebrant, Father C. H. Ramm
as deacon and Father W. P. Sullivan
as sub-deacon. Father Joseph Byrne
of Novato, who is the chaplain of the
institution for which the mass* was
held, preached the sermon. The choir
sang some beaufiful selections.
Walter R. Sabin of St. Luke's Church
was the organist. Cantor Stark had
chaise of the enlarged choir and under
his direction excellent Thanksgiving
music was given.
"All Praise to God," Wagner; closing
prayer; national anthem, "America,"
choir and congregation; benediction,
Kabbi Voorsanger.
The programme was as follows:
Quartet selection; opening, 111th psalm,
Sulzer; opening prayer. Rabbi Myers;
scripture reading, CanTor Stark; an
them, "Ye Shall Dwell in the Land,"
Barnby; sermon. Rabbi Nleto; hymn.
The Hebrews of the city turned out in
large numbers to attend the combined
services at Temple Emanu-El on Sut
ter street. The congregations of
Emanu-El, Sherith Israel, Beth Israel
and Ohabal Shalome united to hear the
sermon preached by Rabbi Nieto. Rab
bis Voorsanger, Levy and Myers also
took part in the services.
The day was one that alone should
have been sufficient cause for thanks
giving. Added to this beautiful weath
er, the present prosperity of the city
and State gave ample cause for a uni
versal day of praise for the goodness
of God In meting out to California such
a share of blessings.
The churches were crowded to the
dcors. and many of them held the com
bined congregations of several houses
of worship. The augmented choirs ren
dered special praise music, and -many
glorious anthems were heard.
The poor and the sick of San Fran
cIeco were riot forgotten by generous
citizens. At the City and County Hos
pital and at the Almshouse* the povr
erty-stricken and the sufferers were
munificently filled to overflowing with
dainty cuts of the luscious national
bird and the accompanying regimen.
The little hearts of the homeless
Â¦waifs were made glad by the generos
ity of the Sisters of the Holy Family.
Such a spread as they had never for a
moment thought of was placed before
them, end their smiles of Joy were re
ward enough for the Christian Sisters.
The Jewish orphanage on Devisadero
street was filled with enticing holiday
foods, and the Salvatlpn Army fed
hordes of poor. Men, women and chil
dren partook of their generous hospi
tality.
At the First Presbyterian Church, on
Van Ness avenue, a large and fashion
able audience filled the huge house of
worship. Long lines of carriages and
cabs lined the avenue in front of the
church, bearing the select population
of that section of the city.. Rev. Dr.
Guthria delivered the sermon and the
choir rendered music specially prepared
for the occasion.
Under a cloudless canopy, in the
midst of California's most delightful
weather, thousands of the city's people
observed Thanksgiving day. The vari
ous churches held special services In
thankfulness for the bounteous year
that has Just passed. Elaborate musi
cal programmes were given and some
of the city's best musical talent partic
ipated, rendering song^, anthems and
organ eolos.

Â»..MIss Alice Bailey, of Atlanta, Ga., 1H
tells how she was permanently cured of
inflammation of the ovaries, and escaped
the surgeon's . knife, by the, use of
Lydia E* Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
The universal indications of the approach of woman's great enemy, inflam-
mation and disease of the ovaries, are a dull throbbing pain, accompanied by
a sense of tenderness and heat low down in the side, with occasional
shooting 1 pains. On examination it may be found that the region of pain will
show some swelling. This is the first stage of inflammation of the ovaries.
"Dear Mrs. Tetcham : â I vnah to express my gratitude for the
restored health and happiness Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound has brought into my life.
"I had suffered for three years with terrible pains at the time of,
menstruation, and did not know what the trouble was until the doctor
pronounced it inflammation of the ovaries, and proposed an operation.
"I felt so weak and sick that I felt sure that I could not survive the
ordeal, and so I told him that I would not undergo it. â¢ The following
week I read an advertisement in the paper of your Vegetable Compound
in such an emergency, and so I decided to try it. Great was my joy to
find that I actually improved after taking two bottles, so I kept taking
it for ten weeks, and at the end of that tune I was cured. I had gained
eighteen pounds and was in excellent health, and am now. .
"You surely deserve great success, and you have my very best
wishes** â Miss Alice Baiucy, 60 North Boulevard, Atlanta, Ga.

Defeats Chicago Univers
ity Pointless. in Annual
Football Game.
CHICAGO. Nov. 26.â Chicago Univer
sity surrendered the Western football
championship to-day and went down
to defeat before the University, of
Michigan, 23 to 0, on Marshall Field
in the annual Thanksgiving day con
test. Some 20,000 spectators braved the
cold and five inches of snow to see
the game. Considerable delay was ex
perienced in starting the game on ac
count of the labor of sweeping the
snow off the gridiron. Coach Stagg
had a fever and attended the game
closely wrapped in blankets in a car
riage.
The usual vigor of the Chicago eleven
was missing. Michigan scored the first
touchdown in twelve minutes of play
by smashing Heston and Longman
against the yielding Chicago line 'and
using Joe Maddock, right tackle, for
first downs when a few yards were
needed. The left end of Chicago's line
was particularly vulnerable and Spelk,
Parry and Wrightman were swept as.de
by the rush of Heston and Graver. So
desperate and wearisome was Eeker
sall's tackling that he had to give way
to Lee Maxwell in the second half.
Eckersall did not do well in kicking,
as was predicted by those who had
watched his work when his goals from
field won the game /rom Wisconsin.
In the first half Michigan was held
only once for downs and Chicago was
possessor of the ball only three times.
A slight shifting of Chicago's players
In the second half brought out a flash
of the old offense but it was due great
ly to the individual efforts of Bezdek
and Nordenholt, and proved barren of
substantial results.

I>efeats University of Wisconsin on
MADISON, Wis., Nov. 26.â The Uni
versity of Wisconsin received another
football defeat to-day by bowing to the
University of Minnesota, 17 to 0. All
the -scoring was done in the second
half, Wisconsin apparently not having
sufficient strength to hold out through
the game, although It fought desper
ately all the time. Captain Abbott of
Wisconsin was disabled early in the
first half._ Minnesota seemed overcon
fident in the first half, but got down to
hard work during the second period of
the play. Michigan , had defeated Wis
consin 16 to 0, and Minnesota had tied
Michigan. Minnesota wished to excel
Michigan, and by hard fighting did so
by a margin of one point. This wish
spurred Minnesota to fierce, fast play-
Ing in the second half. The Minnesota
team seemed to be reborn. It worked
together and pounded a victory out of
a good team before an adversely , in
clined crowd of 7000 persons. Davis,

CHICAGO. Nor. 2t5. â Carlisle Indians
defeated Northwestern University to-day
at football, 28 to 0, on the American

ing the contest snow fell in such blinding
swlals that the players were concealed
from the 3000 spectators who gathered to
root for the Evanstoji eleven, and the
Indians. Coach McCormack's eleven was
materially weakened by the absence of
Guard Phillips, an alumnus of Carlisle,
from the line. The old Carlisle lineman
prefered not to play against his former
schoolmates. Watching the contest from

field been free from snow CarllslÂ»'s speedy

lyn 1C, Battery D 6.
Clapp for the Brooklyns played a
strong game at fullback. Both elevens
played poorly at various stages of the
game and few of the men were in con
dition. There was some slugging and
much rough work. Battery D was
weakest in the line, and the opposing
team took advantage of this fact by
using the full list of center players. The
artillerymen scored three touchdowns,
but missed two of the> goals.
The Brooklyns qualified for the finals
in the Amateur Athletic League foot
ball championship series at the Pre
sidio athletic grounds yesterday after
noon by defeating the eleven from Bat
tery D by a score of 16 to 6. This means
that the artillerymen are out of the race
for the cup. The game was fiercely
contested from beginning to end and
the crowd in the grandstand went wild
with enthusiasm over the "struggle.
The most sensational play of the
game was a fifty-five yard run by Lang
of Battery D. He secured the pigskin
on a fumble and, after running about
in uncertainty for several seconds,
finally took the right direction and
went over the goal line for a touch
down.
Mr. Carolan played some new ponies
yesterday and was in the thick of the
scrimmage. The teams lined up: .
Redsâ T. A. Driscoll, W. McCreery, E.
W. Howard, Joe Tobin Jr.
Whitesâ F. J. Carolan, R. M. Tobin,
L. McCreery, C. Dunphy.
Four periods of ten minutes each were
played*, the Whites winning ultimately
by a score" of 4 to 2. R. M. Tobin scored
a fifth goal for his team; but it was not
allowed, as he was offside, when the
play was made. Lawrence McCreery
did the major. part of the scoring for
the winners. . v ;
The Reds played In considerable hard
luck, as Tom Driscoll barely missed sev
eral goals, one ball striking the goal
post and bounding outside.
When the time for the annual cup
matches come around the
Club will have fine material for a team
in Tom Driscoll, Charley Dunphy, R. M.
Tobin and the" two McCreerys,. Law

The class of the ponies has been
raised considerably since last season,
all the players being exceptionally well
mounted. Charlie Dunphy, who is pro
nounced the most accomplished horse

ance on the field after an absence of

OAKLAND. Nov. 26.â In an association
football game that was fu!l of exciting
incidents between the Hornets and *the
team from the ships in San Francisco
Bay this afternoon at hlora Park, neither
side scored. The Hornets, by their su
perior teaip wdrk. kept the ball In the
sailors' territory most of the time of. the
two halves, but often the sailors, by
fierce play. . would get the sphere dan
gerously near their opponents' goal. The
soggy condition of the uround did much
to prevent the teams scoring, as the run
ning ttsÂ»s difficult.

ball across "Wisconsin's goal line, and
the third time Burdlck had the honor.
Rogers kicked goal twice. The score
was: Minnesota 17, Wisconsin 0.
By a. series of line smashes Stanford
made fifteen yards and then sent Still
man through left tackle for fifteen
yards more. Fierce smashes at the In
dians' line brought the ball to their
five-yard line again, where they made
a determined stand and got the ball
on downs. Pierce kicked pcorly for
thirty yards and the ball wag brought
back eight yards by Dole. On a quar
terback glass Bansbach took the ball
and with splendid interference skirted
left end for a touchdown. Smith kicked
goal. Score: Stanford, Â«; Indians, 0.
The first half ended with the ball In
Sherman's hands on their own thirty
yard line.
The second half was faster and both
teams played better ball. Stanford's
second touchdown was made en Dole s
spiral kick, which Silvas fumbled, and
Stillman carried it over the line. Smith
kicked goal from a difficult angle.
Score: Stanford. 12; Sherman. 0.
"When they lined up again and Dole
had kicked forty yards. Neafua did
splendid work, running the ball In on
a series of shift plays for twenty-five
and ten yards In quick succession.
Sherman was penalized fifteen yards
for off-side play and Neafua kicked for
twenty-five yards. Stanford got the
ball and gradually worked it down the
field to the thirty-yard line, where
Bansbach took It across after a thirty
yard run around right end. Smith
kicked an easy goal and the score was:
Stanford. 18; Sherman. 0.
From this time until the call of time
the ball was in the hands cf the In
dians and they made decisive gaing
around Stanford's ends. Neafus carried
the ball through the ends for five, six
and ten yards. Pierce and Dole ex
changed punts and the game ended
with the ball on Sherman's thlrty-flve
yard line. Score: Stanford, IS; Sher
man. 0. Officialsâ Umpire. McGee. Stan
ford; referee, Major Collins, Belmont.
Time, 25-minute halves.
Captain Bansbach was the bright
particular star of Stanford's line-up,
and for the Indians Bemis Pierce. Nea
fus, Lugo and Torre's played a splendid
game. Pierce's tackling and his Inter
ference when Neafus was sent around
the ends were as good as anything in
that line ever seen here. The playing
of both teams was free from extreme
ly rough play, which marred the play
between Sherman and Berkeley In thi3
city last Thanksgiving.
A crowd of 7000 persons filled the
.seats when Dole kicked off for Stan
ford. Silvas carried the ball in fifteen
yards, and Pierce kicked to Stanford's
thirty-five-yard line. Dole ran in fif
teen yards before he was downed, and
Stanford then began to hammer Sher
man's line for gains. Exchange kicks
left the ball in Stanford's hands on the
Indians' forty-yard line. Bansbach
made twenty yards on a fake pass play.
A series of tandem bucks at left tackle
netted Stanford fifteen yards, and with
but five yards to make Dole was sent
through the line. He was downed on
the three-yard line and lost the ball to
the Indiana. Pierce kicked out of dan
ger and Bansbach ran in fifteen yards
before he was downed.
Although the year's coaching of the
Sherman team by Bemis Pierce devel
oped several strong players, they were
not quick to take advantage of oppor
tunities and were slow in solving the
offensive tactics of the collegians. A
quarterback pass fooled them several
times, and two of the touchdowns
scored by Stanford were made on the
clever execution of this play.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 28.â The Stan
ford varsity eleven defeated the Sher
man Indian team from Riverside this
afternoon at Prager Park by the score
of 18 to 0. The play of both teams was
marked by clean work, and not a sin
gle player on either side resorted to
rough or unfair tactics. Stanford was
much faster behind the line than the
Indians and seldom failed to make de
cisive gains when the ball came into
their hand?. The collegians kept the
ball In their opponents' territory the
greater part of the time. To the great
work of Bansbach. Stillman. Chalmers,
Dole and Thompson of Stanford all
credit is due.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 26.â Los Ange
les took both games from Seattle to
day, making It four straight for the
series, two of. which were shut-outs.
The first game to-day ended unsatis
factorily because the Northerners went
into a fit of sulks over McDonald's de
cision and quit when Los Angeles had
scored three runs and nobody out. In
the third inning, with Spies and Hoy
on bases. Wheeler hit a bo'inder to
Barber, who threw to Byers to catch
Spies at the plate. McDonald called

Graham In Great Form.
Southpaw Oscar Graham was the
main performer during the morning
battle at Oakland. He let the Natives
down with four scattered hits. Irwin
connected for three of these. Whalen
came in for his bumps often, and the
Cripples put five over the plate. Jack
O'Connell was eating his Thanksgiving
turkey for breakfast and of course
could not show up, so McKay and Hod
son did the stunts with the indicator.
Their decisions seemed to please. The

The Natives and their Cripple op
ponents treated each other to an even
break yesterday. While the battle
waxed warm cm the field at Oakland
the Cripples were making all the runs
and they never gave uncle's tossers a
chance, winning 4 to 0. The afternoon
struggle was a torrid one in spots and
the home stickers got away with the
glory. 5 to 4.
Uncle got off lucky considering the
make-up of his team. Danny Shay is
Ftill in the hospital class and unable'
to perform. Mr. . Krug was called in
from center field and Instructed as to
his rights in shortstop territory. . Mr.
Cutter was forced to don his mitt and
chase the long ones out in center field.
Old Peter wanted both games badly,
so he put Cooper in the box to shoot
'em over, notwithstanding the fact
that the slender southwinger did slab
duty the day before. Cooper was not
treated right by the fielder*, but still
he fared about as well as Iberg. Both
pitched good ball.
The game opened up with a rush and
the Cripples sent two over -the route
so quickly that the admirers of the
home team threw their hats skyward.
O'Hara started the battle with a bingle
to the outfield. Rockenfield laid down
a bunt which Pabst proceeded to fum
ble. Then he picked it up and threw
it away. While he was thus engaged
both O'Hara and Rockenrield began to
hot foot over the cushions, nor did they
hesitate till both landed with luns.
The Natives made a fast comeback
in their half of the round. Both Lynch
and Meany drove the leather safely.
Then Devereaux threw the tall away
at the plate and Peter Lohaian made a
wide toss to second and tnen another
hit was forthcoming and in conse
quence the Natives amassed four runs
before the round was over.
More runs and excitement were on
for the next round. The Cripples start
ed in right away to lambast? the of
ferings of Ham Iberg. How well they
succeeded is shown In the score. Four
safe bingles netted two runs, just
enough to tie up the score and make
a deadlock for four more innings.
Irwin tore off another in the fifth and
Pabst sent him around to third with
a good healthy drive. Pabst'a bad foot
seemed to bother him some, so it was
agreed to let Hodson do the running.
Hoddie was immediately caught nap
ping off the bag and it looked bad. He
started doÂ«vn the line and then Mes
serly threw to third to catch Irwin.
The throw wa's wide, so Irwin had am
ple time to scamper in with the win
ning tally. The score:

were won in two short sets.
What was lacking in the other
matches, however, was found in the
final match. This was one of the
closest seen at the park for a long
time. It took all five sets to settle the
question of supremacy. A noticeable
feature/ is that not one of the five sets
was close. | The contestants were Miss
Hazel Hotchkiss and George Baker,
and Miss Ethel Ratcllffe and Charles
Dunlap. They met on even terms.
When the former won the first set 6-1
it looked easy for them. Their oppo
nents won the next two sets just as
easily. The last two sets went to Miss 1
Ratcliffe and Baker, giving them the
match. Summary:

Nearly 3000 " spectators enjoyed the
field day given yesterday at the Ingle
side race track under the auspices of
the Gaelic Athletic Association. The
day was an ideal one for the sports.
No records were broken as the track
was too soft. Some of the best athletes
on the coast took part In the contests
The surprise of the day was the defeat
of Abadie of the University of Cali
fornia by L. Schwartz, a Lowell High
School sprinter, in the 100-yard dash.
Abadie and Gerhardt ran a 'dead heat
in the semi-final and it was rhought
the race would be between them. They,
however, did not count on Schwartz,
who developed a burst of speed and
beat Abadie out by three feet.
The two-mile race also proved inter
esting. In the last quarter Hackley of
the University of California took the
lead and sprinted away from Maun
drell and Garcia. H. W. Bell, a promis
ing Stanford athlete, captured two
firsts and one second. He shattered no
records, but proved a dangerous com
petitor. The University of California
was represented by P. G. Hannigan. A.
C. Plaw, Victor Lieda, E. R. Abadie, R.
C. Hackley and H. W. Ross, all of
whom showed up well.
The initial contest for the Gaelic foot
ball championship of the Gaelic Athletic
League was highly exciting. The Wolfe
Tones defeated the Emeralds by a score
of 5 to 2. The victors will hold the H. J.
Crocker cud for a year. When won
three tirrfes it becomes the permanent
property of the club.
The teams were made up as follows:
Wolfe Tones â C. Mclnerney (captain),
P. Kearney, J. MjpGurrin, J. Lawler, P.
Crowe, P. Stapleton, T. Mclnerney, J.
Heafcy. B. Fox, J. Laughlin, P. Con-
Ion, T. Lane, J. J. Lane, J. Hannigan.
the day's play. The successful players
were Harry Rolfe, Ray Splivalo, â¢ Jo
seph S. Tobln, Will 4 Allen, J. D. Mac-
Gavin, Alden Ames, Herbert Schmidt
and Charles Kuehn.
These eight players represent every
class in the club but one, and that is
the limit class. Allen and MacGavin
are "owe 15"; Tobln is "owe 2-6";
Schmidt Is "owe 1-6": Rolfe and Spli
valo are "scratch"; Kuahn is "4-6," and
Ames is "15 4-6." The fact that these
representative players are left show
how perfectly, the handicapping was
done.
The feature of the day was the work
of Joe Tobin. Tobin ten years ago was
considered one of the best players. He
lived up to his reputation yesterday,
winning both of his matches without
losing a set. His match with Frank
Mitchell was an interesting one. Mitch
ell gave Tobln "owe 4-V and the wise
ones thought he would win easily.
They did not figure on the steadiness
of the ex-champion, which won out. for
him. :Mr\ .-;V- .-:-.
L. C. Bozarth, with "15 3-6." had an
easy time with Collier, who owed 15.

In the Cincinnati Enquirer of fCovem
ber 16 appears an article written by the
Chicago correspondent of that paper
saying that the Windy City horsemen
have just discovered that The Fiddler,
on which such a big coup was made,
was none other than Joe Lesser. Ac
cording to the story Joe Lesser started
in a race at St. Louis on September 9
and then dropped out of sight. Joe
Lesser is owned by Gil Summers, who
took True Blue EaEt, and the gelding Is
now at Ingleside track. Gil says that
on the day The Fiddler won Joe Lesser
stood in a stall at Delmar track, which
fact can be verified by Presiding Judge
Brady and other officials of the St.
Louis track. Somebody ought to find

D. Hall displays both good and bad

Harbor with the same ability that a

his horse was in first-class condition

The Thistle Association Football team
defeated the Albion Rovers 2 goals to 0
yesterday morning in a "well-fought
match on the Presidio Athletic grounds.
The Thistles did not have their
strongest team and their combination
work was hardly so good as usual. In
spite of some determined rushes by the
Albion Rovers' forward, the Thistles
had the ball near their opponents' goal
during most of the first half, T. Disher
putting it between .the posts once. On
a. second occasion the ball slipped from
Goalkeeper John's hands and rolled Just
across the line into the goal, but the
referee did not allow the score. GI11
chrest and Churchill, on the left wing,
and Bradley on the right did good work
for the Rovers.
in the second half T. Lydon scored
another goal for the Thistles from an
oblique kick. The Rovers, though they
.played more vigorously than in the first
half and tried their best to score, were
not able to put the ball between the
posts. C. W. Irish was referee. The
ground was in good condition. A few
spectators, among them Supervisor
James . P. Booth and F. P. Deerijig,
president of the Bohemian' Club,
watched the game. The two elevens
lined up as follows:

MANY GOLFERS
ON CITY LINKS
â¢iosers Play a Plucky
â¢Game, but Fail to
Score a Goal.
Neglected in the betting except by
those who remembered that he was a
four-time Derby winner, Claude, ridden
by Johnny Daly and. 10 to 1 in the ring,
captured the rich Thanksgiving handi
cap at Oakland track yesterday, and
the l A ng-range shooters were made
riotou5ly happy. .
The crowd was a record-breaking one
for the track across the bay. the holi
day throng representing a gathering of
fully SOCK) people. Handsomely gowned
ivn-nen and their escorts talked horse
with a wise air on the clubhouse ve
randas and green, while in the grand-
Eter.d. with its bewildering mass of
color and pretty faces, the opposite sex
outnumbered the male population
rearly two to one.
The weather was warm and balmy,
seemingly made for racing purposes,
but the track was a puzzling one for
students of form. It was muddy near
the rail and in nearly every instance
the rider who picked his course about
fifteen feet out from the rail was re
turned the winner.
Only the sturdy and the strong took ,
a chance of penetrating into the Inner
most recesses of the ring. In it there
was presented a seemingly betting mad
mass of speculators, and twenty-one
bookmakers were scarcely adequate to ;
T.cndio the money.
BOOKIES WIN AND LOSE.
A few of the layers did not add to
their worldly possessions, but the major
portion did. for Sol Smith and E. M.
Rrattain were the only favorites to
Â«core.
The gross valuation of the handicap
was ?319Â«. of which sum the winner re
ceived $2:20. The distance was one and
en eiphth miles and ten owners accept
ed the weitrhts. the buple sum
moned the starters to the post Ben
MacDhut. carrying- 115 pounds and rid
den by Adkins. ruled equal favorite with
Proper, the Jennings three-year-old,
assigned 113 pounds, and having Jack
Martin in the saddle. Claude, carrying
top weight. 116 pounds, could be called
Â£n added starter, for, because of some
oversight, his name did not appear on
the programme. Mike Daly's good colt
"was at v one time 10 to 1. closing at 6
and S. There was little delay at the
post. Dick Dwyer releasing the barrier
to a perfect start. Like a skipper of the
treacherous Arctic waters. Johnny Daly
on Claude had his course mapped out
beforehand. He quickly shot his mount
to the front and that practically tells
the story. Claude gradually Increased
his lead until at the end he won handily
by three and a half lengths.
Grail was the only other starter that
at any time locked troublesome, but
Caesar Young's mare grew leg weary
the last eighth, losing the place to Fos
f:1, on which Birk<=-nruih rode a well
judged race.
Proper got in a jam soon after the
start, stumbling and almost throwing
Martin from the saddle. This ruined
the colt's chances-. Adkins on Ben Mac-
Dhui picked out the rail position, where
the err.ns was worst, and might Just
&s well have not started.
LACY CRAWFORD SCORES.
Lacy Crawford, from the Schreiber
stable, was the opening seven-furlong
selling number at odGs of 6 to Y He
was ably ridden by Hall and beat the 9
to 10 favorite. Arcade, five open lengths.
Past Master downed Blissful for the
show.
There is no doubt about Sol Smith
being some pumpkins over a heavy
track. He rarzle-dazzled a fair field on
Wednesday and repeated the trick in
the 2-year-old event yesterday. Nine
to 10 was the last quotation, and he fin
ished five lengths ahead of F. E. Shaw
at the wire. Effervescence beat the
wretchedly handled Harbor for show
honors.
Albemarle 5s no 2 to 2 horse and that
is a cenair.ty. Xot that L. Spencer did
not do the best he could with him in
the third sprint, but it Is difficult to
shake traits early acquired late in life.
Jockey Club, played from 6 down to
3, piloted by "Wfl'Sam Waldo. led all the
way and 1n a staggering finish got the
verdict from Hainault. Show honors
were easy for Albomarle.
Caesar Young's "bush" bully E. M.
Brattain looked like cold turkey to
take the five-furlrmg dash, but he
didn't do it without an effort. Colonel
Van closed strongly the last eighth, and
the gray horse only landed by a head.
Although conceding weight. Bay Won
der, if Ferrell had picked better going,
could have wor..
Illowah'o. the post favorite, finished
third in the cloying mile and a six
teenth event. Plan received stanch
support,, but in a long hard drive was
downed bv Man of Honor, with Jack
Martin in the saddle.

across Great Salt Lake, known as the
Lucin cut-off, passed through Nevada
during the day. The party, from an
observation car at the rear, noted the
extensive I improvements between og
den and Reno. These . improvements,
aside from the construction of the cut
off across the lake, consist of a reduc-l
tion of grades and curves and the
shortening' of mileage.
The special train, which consists of
three sections, will reach Reno to-mor

of the railroad was one of
three men who removed the spikes and
fish-plates from a rail. The other two
men. It is alleged/were Charles McKin
ney and Thomas Foster,' who are under
arrest. It is said that McKinney, when
confronted by the detective, confessed
his share in the plot under promise of
lenlency. Two agents of the railroad
were in hiding within twenty-five feet
of where the crime was being at
tempted. . These men were heavily
armed but did pot , shoot, as to have

TRAINS . SOON WIMj CROSS.
The men who inspected the work to
day were chary about expressing them
selves for publication, but these opin
ions were gleaned from them:
That the cut-off is one of the most
remarkable pieces of engineering ever
undertaken.
That eventually it will be a success,,
although much remains to be done.
That the sagging of the track in
places and other things indicate that
the roadbed Is not yet ready for regu
lar travel, but that persistence in the
present course of dumping in 40,000 tons
of rock a day must in time be effective.
Â¦Â¦ Although the official figures as to the
cost are $4,000,000, it was learned that
$5,000,000 already had been spent on the
cut-off and that the engineers figure
a .total of $10,000,000 and perhaps $14,
000,000.
pllmentary comments on the engineer-
Ing work they were watching was the
crowning day of his life. Hood, it has
long been understood, has looked upon
the Ogden-Lucin cut-off as the monu
ment he is erecting to himself as an
engineer. i .

"The publication-, of the incident of
a photograph in which my daughter

grew out of a costume party held here
In my apartments at which fifty or
sixty persons were present. All of them
were photographed; first in cne group,
then in smaller groups and in the pres

"I intend to force this action to a
conclusion as rapidly as possible and
the testimony shall bt taken in open
court. I shall force them to show their
hands."
"Vlasto was a friend of Dr. Culver,
my son-in-law, for several years. It
was through Dr. Culver that I
first met him and he made oc
casional visits here, where he became
acquainted with my family. We al
ways considered him an educated and
highly respectable man and an agree
able companion. He has been th2 guest
of T)r. Culver on two excursions, one
to the West, one to Europe. He is an
elderly man, old enough to be grand
father to my daughter," and ?Me never
regarded him in any other light than
as a courteous friend. Any allusion as
to other relations than that are un
reasonable and actuated by motives of
malice. Vlasto has been accustomed to
go to Europe every year and that he
met my daughter in Paris, that he was
a guest at a tea party or dinner party
is a matter that could hot give rise to
any comment, as It was perfectly

OGDEN, Utah, Nov. 26.â The Ogden-
Lucin cut-off is 102 miles in length, 72
miles on land and 30 miles on trestle
work and fill-ins over the waters of
Great. Salt Lake. It presents a practi
cally level track, except for a short dis
tance on the west end near Lucln, Nev.,
where a slight grade is encountered.
The use of the cut-off will throw out
of transcontinental traffic the old line
from Ogden to Lucln, Nev., around the
north end of Great Salt Lake. This
stretch of track, 147 miles in length, is
one of the most difficult and expensive
of the Harrlman system. Its maxi
mum, grade, over the long Promontory
Hill, is 104 feet to the mile, and helper
engines are necessary. The elimina
tion of this* trackage from overland
traffic will thus mean not only a saving
of more than $1500 a day in the actual
operating expenses, but also a saving of
two hours in running time.
The original scheme for the cut-off
was a pet plan of the late Collls P.
Huntlngton, and under his directions
Chief Engineer Hood prepared the
plans for the great engineering feat.
The plans were perfected after Hunt
ington's death and the surveys were
approved by E. H.- Harriman when he
obtained control of the ' line. Actual
work on the cut-off was commenced in
March, 1902, and thus the immense task
has been completed in about twenty
months. The last pile was driven dur
ing the last week of October; the track
was completely connected and the floor
ing and railing of the long trestle com
pleted to-day, but work on the fill-Ins
at either end of the trestle will continue
for some time, and it piobably will be
several months before the cut-off is In
corporated in the overland system for
all traffic.
The great work has cost the South
ern Pacific Companay more than $4,200,
000. The cut-off runs from Ogden west
for fifteen miles over level country be
fore reaching the lake shore, then
crosses the east arm of the lake, a
width of nine miles to Promontory
Point, nineteen miles across the
west arm of the lake, thence across
the Great Salt Lake Desert to Lucin,
Nev. . Across the east arm of the lake
will be an almost continuous fill-In
supporting the trestle. Near the middle
of this will be a gap of six hundred feet
of open trestle work, left for the waters
of the Bear River, which flow into this
arm of the lake.
Across Promontory Point runs fire
miles of solid roadbed,. and here difficult
work was encountered, a cut of 3000 feet
in length * through the sand- and rock
of the abrupt cliff being necessary. - On
this point, one of the most picturesque
around the Inland sea, a station will be
maintained, and surveys "' have been
made for a mammoth summer resort.
Across the west arm of the lake is . a
stretch of eleven miles of trestle work,
with a fill-in approach at each. end of
four miles. Â¦
In accomplishing the work, of span
ning the lake one great difficulty was
encountered across the east arm in the
"sinks" or. settling of the - fill-ins and
trestle work. This was caused by the
salt from the flow of Bear River having
collected for centuries over the bottom
of Â¦ the lake' and ' formed an insecure
foundation for a depth of nearly a hun
dred feet. . It took thousands of tons of
rock and piles without number. to reach
the bottom of the lake proper, but this
was finally accomplished and the grad
ual'spreading; out 'and, packing of; the
fill has resulted in a firm roadbed. /

NEW YORK, Nov. 26.â On a winter

the colossal Cedric of the White Star
line (sunk In midocean by a senseless
rumor) warped into her Nor^h River
dock this evening to a tumult of cheers
from more than BOO persons. There
was a trace of the hysterical in the
greeting. The usual ropes separating
those entitled to go within the customs
lines from those who were not were
not stretched, out of regard to the
pent-up feelings of the friends and
kindred of the seagoers, and there were
scenes bordering on the lachrymose at
the foot of the gangplank when it was

Young women flung themselves into
their mothers* arms as if the unsink
able liner had been in some danger.
The flamboyant newspaper headlines of
two days had got In their nerve-rack

the kisses explosive and the voices

American invention, calmed down when
told that the story originated in Lon

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 26.â A Johns
town flood in miniature but devoid of
all its horror and loss of life swept
over the yards and streets in the An
gelina Heights district of the city at
8 o'clock this morning, tearing away
fences, sweeping wagons for blocks,
flooding cellars and covering car tracks
under several feet of mud, but injuring
no person.
Without warning the northwest wall
of the big city reservoir burst, send
ing more than 1.000,000 gallons of water
dow- a hill more than 80 feet in height
and sweeping everything in its path.
Fortunately the break occurred upon
the side of the reservoir on which there
are few buildings and the flood spent
its force in a wide gully and then
flowed like a cloudburst in a mountain
canyon through the streets in that sec
tion of the city.
The streets there are narrow and in
places the water swept from house to
house five feet deep. Innes avenue re
ceived the full force of the torrent and
for more than a block cement sidewalks
were ripped up and several wagons
which had been left standing in that
seldom used street were swept away
and lodged several blocks down the
hill. An iron grading plow was swept
more than a block.
The family of W. F. Jackson, who
live nearest the break, was saved only
by reason of the fact that the wall
burst 100 feet north of their house and
the torrent ran in an opposite direc
tion. The back flow surrounded the
house with water, the first floor being
covered to a depth of a foot or more.
In the immediate vicinity of the reser
voir the flood lasted less than ten min
utes, the water spreading to outlets
which led to down town streets.
Half a mile away streets were filled
with water from curb to curb and
scores of persons had to wade across
streets which a few moments before
had been dry and dusty. None of them
then knew the source of the flood and
the sudden rush of water caused al
most a panic in many a family. It also
caused several teams to run away.
but there were no casualties. Along
Grand avenue as far south as Jeffer
son street the water almost filled the
street, but within half an hour the
flood had entirely subsided.
The bursting of the reservoir was
caused by a defective head gate at the
city pumping station. The pumps
worked all night, those in charge of
them thinking the water was being:
forced into the Garvanza reservoir,
two miles away, but owing to a broken
water gate the flow from the pumps
was pouring, into the old reservoir, and
at the time of the break it was almost
running over. No estimate as to the
property loss has been made by the
city Water Department. The reservoir
will not be repaired, because it was
soon to have been abandoned.

The Overdue List.
Vaqueros and cattlemen generally
hied themselves to the Ingrleside race
track yesterday afternoon to witness
the match race between Cricket and
Pajamas, two fast ponies us^ in driv
ing cattle on week days and fcr racing
on state occasions. Cricket is the horse
that has won quarter-mile dashes "at
the annual butchers' picnics for the
last ten years.- He captured the event
last year by defeating Pajamas.
Since that race the merits of both
horses have been discussed In Butcher
town and at last a match race was ar
ranged. William Harvey, owner of
Cricksj, and Henry Danz. owner of
Pajamas, put up a side t>et 3f $250 and
their friends wagered heavily on .the
race. y"J^' . : /
John Purcell, William Fanning- and
James R.' McElroy were selected judges
and both sides prepared for th^ event.
The contest was brought off after the
Gaelic games" and was "watched by
hundreds of spectators.-"* The start was
a perfect one and the two horses, rid
den by their owners, dashed down the
stretch at' a remarkably fast clip.
Cricket led for a short distance and
then Pajamas' superior speed began to
show and he took thV lead and . main
tained it ' to the finish,' passing under
the wire a length ahead of Cricket.â

L.5ttle work was done yesterday along
the water front, which was used during
the afternoon as a promenade by work
free citizens, their wives and families
in search of novelty and appetite or
seeking etimulation for lazy digestive
apparatus. Stevedores, except on a few
docks where the working of cargo was
urgent, observed the day as a holiday,
and such members of the crews of tied
up vessels as remained on board spent
the holiday taking life easily. The Jap

on behalf of the Pacific Mail Company.

The return match between the Scot
tish bowlers of Oakland and those of
San Francisco resulted in another vic
tory for the " home talent. A large
crowd of spectators witnessed the
games, which were close from start, to
finish. Although each side won two
rinks, the San Francisco players in
each case won by a large margin, and
the total score gave them a victory by
fourteen points. Rink Xo. 1, the skits
for which were: San Francisco, J. M.
Earsman, and for Oakiand, A. Proctor,
was won by the visitors. Score 21 to 17.
Xo. 2 rink, with skits A. Foreman for
San Francisco and H. Forgie for Oak
land, was won by the former, 21 to 14.
Rink Xo. 3, H. S. Tickner, skit for San
Francisco, and J. Patullo, skit for Oak
land, was won by San Francisco, 21 to
6. Rink Xo. 4, with skits W. R. Eaton
for San Francisco, and P. Spaulding
for Oakland, was won by Oakland, 21
to IT. In this rink Oakland borrowed
two crack bowlers from the San Fran
cIeco team, which aided them material
ly In winning it.
The match yesterday was much
closer than the first, and the Oakland
ers showed great improvement over
their initial performance. Following is

1 WAS NEVER. MORE IN EVIDENCE THAN TO-DAY
i - .- ' "AT WORK"
U . The publisher of The Call, in anticipating the tendency cf the times
p . in giving more time to recreation, hunting and fishing, has acquired for
|J their exclusive use a series of. art pictures which will serve as reminders
JH . during the busy months of those delightful days passed in the field.
fl "At Work," the title of the next Sunday Call's offering, is a reprcdec-
fl tion from an oil painting by J. 2L Tracy, an artist whose paintings cf
b dogs have never been surpassed.
p \ Mr. Tracy had for the subject of this study the celebrated Uewellyn
|| setter, "BuDEBIGO," who became famous in this country by his clean
| sweep of bench and field events.
| ' This picture, while it appeals strongly to those who know every point
S in a dog, is perhaps just as interesting to the many who love the faithful
jÂ£ animal.
! | In handling, color and action, "At Work" is a most life-like study; a
Â£ picture that, when. framed, could with difficulty b* distinguished from
Â§ the original oil painting. .
pi To overlook this is to .miss one of the best 'of the Sportsmen's Series.
| DON'T DO IT. ORDER THE CALL TO-DAY.

taxed the capacity of the auditorium.
Rev. S. S. Marquis, Episcopalian,
aroused much enthusiasm by his ad
dress. He said on denominationalism:
"It seems to me that If there is one
thing more apparent than another it is
that God has refuted our denomina

that God can work independent of ec

The fire is presumed to have orig
inated in the furnace-room of the Al
len building. The flames were first seen
when they broke out on the second
floor, this part of the building contain
ing the heaviest part of the wholesale
grocery stock. The buildings were filled
with the most inflammable class of ma
terial, and after the roof fell in the
blaze shot far into the air and dense
volumes of =moke, illuminated by the
fire, rolled still higher.
The firemen were working about thir
ty feet inside the Allen Brothers' build
ing when the floor above unexpectedly
collapsed, catching the men with no
chance of escape and with no possibil
ity of their comrades rescuing them.
Their bodies were not even recovered
from the burning building.

Mrs. Clark secured an ax and began

MANY SIGN PETITIONS.
Supplementary to the forming of the
State councils, petitions are being cir
culated throughout the United States
for presentation to President Roose
velt, requesting the nation's chief ex
ecutive to aid in preserving the Cala
veras big trees. The petition follows:
APPEAL TO PRESIDENT.
The Calaveras big tree committee
of the Outdoor Art League of Califor
nia, is meeting with signal success in
its effort to institute a national move
ment for the preservation ol the Cala
veras big trees. Mrs. Lovell White,
chairman of the committee and presi
dent of the league, is in receipt of
many letters from the chief executives
of a number of States, from United
States Senators and from men promi
nent in the work of forestry, all of
whom promise their hearty co-opera
tion in the plan to have the Govern
ment purchase the giant grove with
a view to its perpetual preservation.
A bill for the purchase of the trees
has already been presented by Con
gressmen J. N. Gillette, J. C. Need
ham and the California delegation.
Former bills were approved by the
Public Lands Committee and were
passed by the Senate, but they failed
to secure a hearing in the House of
Representatives. Therefore, the Out
door Art League has resolved to make
the preservation of the Calaveras
groves a national affair. To this end
a council is being organized to consist
of Influential men and women in each
State, whose purpose is to aid in form
ing a strong Congressional committee,
whose duty shall be to act in conjunc
tion with the California Representa
tives in devising ways and means for
securing the passage of the big tree
bill.
