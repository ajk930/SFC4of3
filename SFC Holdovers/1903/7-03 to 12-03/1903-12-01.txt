WASHINGTON, Nov. 30.â Although
the State Department has not been in
formed by the British Government that
it" Intends to send its West Indian
squadron to La Guayra to. back up the
demand on President Castro for the re
opening of Orinoco River ports, which
he closed to commerce' during the last

cal parties have not fully and unre^
Bervedly rallied to the support of . the
Government in this crisis.' The internal j
political diRpensions nre slo-wly grow
ing more marked. The Liberal revolu
tionary element particularly is showing
Figns of increasing discontent through
out the Â«*ntiro country and a recurrence j
of the recent revolt at any time within j
the n*xt year would not surprise those j

Colombia may also, n is alleged, at

small schooners and other such craft,
between unimportant and -little known
ports, hopinjr to avoid the .American
gunboats and thus helping 'in the gen
oral movement toward Panama, or pos
sibly landing troops in the Chiriqui dis
trict. The Colombians believe they can
carry out such a movement without the
knowledge of the Americans and are
cor.ndent their soldiers. Inured to thp
hardships of campaigning and living
on the country without a commissariat,
can reach the borders of Panama over
land. Colombia can move troops with

the field without a hospital corps, with
out a commissary department, without |
means of transportation and without â¢
pay.
Notwithstanding the Colombian Gov
ernment'? assurances, all of the politi-
MAY SEND TEOOPS BY SEA.
Bogota and the entire country is
v.-aiting to hear from General Reyes,
i -whose grant of full Presidential power
â¢ has been confirmed. While there is still
I much talk in Colombia of raising a big
' army no actual steps in that direction
\ have yet been made. Public contribu
; tions are being made and decrees are
. occasionally issued reaching to warlike
j preparations. Colombia possesses a
j number of good rifles, some artillery
and an ample supply of ammunition.
| Quantities of ammunition have been
recently moved in carts from Honda,
sixty-five miles from Bogota, on the
Magdalena River, to Bogota.
: Colombia has not lost the idea of
making an effort to regain the Isthmus.
She still entertains hopes that General
Beyes will succeed in effecting a satis
factory arrangement in Washington.
Failing this the Colombians, it is be
lieved, will undoubtedly advance on the
isthmus, sending troop* In small par
ties of 200 to 300 along both coasts suf
ficiently inland to keep their move
ments secret On arriving on the bor
ders of Panama they will, it is said,
begin a guerrilla -warfare, pillaging and
burning.
COLON, Nov. SO. â Louis Deroux, who
was a member of the Colombian House
of Representatives from Panama, who
made a speech in the House on October
2 warning Colombia to sign the Hay-
Herran canal treaty immediately or
she would lose the isthmus the Â¦ day
Congress closed and who was instru
mental in bringing about the appoint
ment of General Obaldia as Governor
of Panama, has arrived here from Bo
gota, whence he 6tarted on November
14. Senor Deroux is a Panamatan, and
owing to his well-known political con
nections he was ' subjected to annoy
ances and affronts in Bogota and on
the llagdalena River, where at one
place, on the passage down a number
of Colombians threatened to board the
Ftearner and molest him. The trouble
was averted by the captain cutting the
vessel's moorings and dropping, down
stream. In Bogota efforts .-were; made
to~ persuade Dtrtnix't6*j6Yn x the t Reyes
commission to the isthmus, but Deroux
abruptly declined.
When Deroux left Bogota the United
States Legation was guarded contin
uously by fifty soldiers armed with
rifles. Minister Beaupre mentioned
that possibly he would come down the
river, but apparently Beaupre has not
decided to do so.
WOULD ASSASSINATE BEATJPRE.
A governmental consulting commis
sion has been formed In Bogota. Â£t is
composed of Liberals, Conservatives
and Nationalists. . According to good
authority at one meeting of the com
mission the statement was repeatedly
made that Beaupre must be killed
whether or not the United States de
stroyed Cartagena in retaliation. Wiser
counsels, however, prevailed.
SHREVEPORT, La., Nov. 30.â In the
presence of a crowd composed of 1200
persons, whites and - negroes, Phil Da

all negroes, were lynched this after
noon within a short distance of Bel

Shreveport. The men were executed
for having participated in the fatal
shooting of Robert Adger, a popular
business man. . j\Â»
The negroes confessed their crime.
They said that they were, trying new

Mrs v Coltâ Something that Garnett
said or did caused Major McClung and
myself to approach him. I cannot re

been the act of Garnett closing the door
Coroner Lelandâ Where did Garnett
stand at this time?
"Mrs. Coltâ H*Â» .was standing just in
side the door and the major and my
self were standing in the middle of the
room near the'center table.
Coroner Lelandâ What' took place
then?
SULYER DREW HIS PISTOL.
"He did not answer me when I spoke
to him and told him he was drunk and
to go away, but he told Major McClun?
to", leave the room. I told the major
not to do so, as I resented Garnett's
insult to my guest. Garnett again told
the major to leave the room, but I
again asked the major to remain.
"I then told Garnett . that he could
not remain, as I was going to dress for
dinner, and I again asked him what he
wanted. He then said. 'I am here for
an apology.'
"Garnett came Into the room, and I
said to him. 'What do you want?' He
had a most fearful expression on his
face and, I would not have known him
had I met him on the street. His eyes
were blazing and he had his teeth
clenched. When he came in \* nzld.
'Well. I am here.*'
"It w-as last Wednesday," she said.
"about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Ma
jor ' McClung -was visiting me. Us
brought me a message from his wife.
We were seated in this room. I had
my back to the door. The door was
slightly open leading Into the hallway
of my apartments.
"Major McClung suddenly smiled and
said. 'Here Is Garnett.' I turned and
saw. Garnett standlnsr In the doorway.
He had his hat on and his overcoat on
his arm.
GARNETT'S EYES HLAZED.
Garnett on the night of his arrest
claimed that McClung had ! tried to
throw him out of Mrs. Coit's apart
ments, that he drew his revolver to de
fend himself and that the weapon ex
ploded In the struggle. Mrs. Coit flatly
contradicts this statement. After be
ing sworn by Coroner Lelar.d. Mrs. Coit
gave her name, and she was then asked
to recount the shooting, of McClung
by Garnett. ?
Mrs. Coit yesterday stated more than
once that Garnett had pulled a revolver
from his vest before Major McClung
ever laid his hands on the man who
afterward took his life.
In answering the questions of the
Coroner and District Attorney Mrs.
Coit Illustrated her evidence by point
ing out the locations in the room where
Garnett and his victim stood at the
time o* the tragedy last Wednesday.
Save for the darkened electric light
that hung over the Head of the bed
upon' which Mrs. Coit reclined, the
apartment was in semi-darkness while
the investigation was held. A trained
nurse was in the room, but her ser
vices were not required during the two
hours occupied In taking the testimony
of the only eye-witnt-ss to the killing
of Major McClung by Garnett.
While the evidence of Mrs. Colt did
not differ materially from the state
ment she made to Detective Byram on
the night of the shooting it brought out
one prominent fact that will be diffi
cult for Garnett to explain away.
POINTED OUT LOCATIONS.
Coroner Leland, accompanied by hi3
stenographer, went to the rooms of
Mrs. Coit yesterday afternoon. Dis
trict Attorney Byington was al3o pres
ent at the taking of the testimony oC
Mrs. Coit and her attorney, H. Cres
well, was also in tl\e room to watch hia
client's interests.
Mrs. Coit did not hesitate In giving
her evidence and the manner in which
she told of the tragedy that took place
in her presence was candid and con
vincing.
The testimony was taken in the room
in which Garnett fatally shot Major
McClung. Mrs. Colt was in bed. but
she sat up while answering the ques
tions of Coroner Leland and District
Attorney Byington.
- At times she betrayed the nervous
strain under which she was suffering,
but she bravely went through the or
deal of the examination.
Mrs. Lillian Hitchcock-Colt. In whose
presence Major J. W. , McClung was
fatally shot last Wednesday afternoon
by Alexander Garnett while in Mrs.
Coit's apartments at the Palace Hotel,
was sufficiently recovered yesterday to
give her deposition to Coroner Leland.
Dr. de Vecchi, Mrs. Colt's physician,
informed Coroner Leland yesterday
that while his patient would not be
able to attend the inquest to-day, it
would be possible to .take her deposi
tion.

committee Rubens explained the man

in connection with the military, what
his services had been and of a differ
ence with General Wood, through* which
he severed his cpnnection with the
Government. He said he then became
counsel in the postbfflce . cases. He
was asked concerning General Wood's
intimacy with Captain Bellairs and
other newspaper men and also if it
were true that General Wood had made
a show of Jealousy of his superior offi
cers. , . /
IMPUGNS WOOD'S VEBACITY.
The witness detailed the relationship
between General Wood and' newspaper
men, saying it was understood that he
attempted to 'use the "newspaper men
to exploit his own deeds. Regarding
Generals Ludlow and Wilson Rubens
said General Wood was quoted as say
ing that he had to get rid of them.
While this was hearsay evidence it was
admitted, as the witness told the com
mittee how it could obtain evidence to
prove the truth of the statements.
At the conclusion of Rubens' testi
mony a member of the committee
asked him his opinion of General
Wood's ; r veraclty. He asked that the
question be made more explicit, and
then was asked if he would be willing
to accept the word of General Wood In
any matter in which the general had
a personal Interest. Rubens - answered
he was sorry to say that he could not
accept General Wood's statement under
such, circumstances.
Before Rubins was called the state :
ment was made by Major Rathbone

bring before the committee any matters
that Involved hearsay evidence, and
that they could not swear to, had the

Horatio S. Rubens of New York, for
merly a. m(u#*ber of . the Cuban junta,

by Major Runcle in | reference to the
knowledge General W o Â°d Is said to
have had of the Runcle. magazine arti
cle criticising unfavorably the admin
istration of Major General Brooke as
Governor General" of Cuba.
One of the most. important state
ments made by Rubens was that Gen
eral Wood visited him after the pub
lication of the Runcie article and that
their conversation showed that General
Wood had previous \ knowledge of It.
Rube'ns. said General x^Woad admitted
that he told Runcie that the article
put him (Wood) in an awkward posi

Rubens also told the committee than
when the break occurred between Run
cie and General Wood he brought them
together and tried to patch up their
differences in a manner that would ex
onerate Runcle of the onus attached to
his name by the report made to the
War Department by General Wood.
The witness also said that when*Runde
wrote to General Wood begging Wood
to set him right before the country,
Runcle showed- him the letter. He told
the contents of the letter to the com

Deputy Congy (Republican-Social
ist) to-day announced his intention to
Interpellate the Minister of War, upon
his return to Paris, in regard to his
action in the Dreyfus case, but the
Ministry replied that it had no inten
tion of arguing the interpellation un
til the commission had rendered its
report.
Public sentiment has been aroused to
a high pitch by this latest phase of
the Dreyfus affair, which was rele
gated to second and third places, re
spectively, by the Panama affair and
the Humbert Inquiry. Some of the sen
sational papers connect the Humberts
with Dreyfus, 'asserting that they used
their influence and money in his be
half in order that the Ministry might
not be -subjected to theNJanger of be
ing shaken up.
In consequence of the agitation fol
lowing the action taken in the Drey
fus affair, the Government has allowed
the publication of the declaration made
at the last meeting of the Council by
M. Valle, the Minister of Justice. The
Minister communicated to his col-'
leagues the contents of the dossier,
and the result of the examination made
by War -Minister Andre and himself,
adding:
"You understand that I will not con
sult you or solicit advice. I have sim-.
ply determined to inform you of my
decision, which I have the right to take
as Minister of Justice, and which I
take on my own responsibility."

became unduly excited when the Cu
bans held indignation meetings in San
tiago for the purpose of protesting
against the centralization order. The

General Brooke read a letter which
he had sent to the adjutant general of

publication of such articles during the
period of military government. He also
read General Wood's reply to the adju
tant general, which, the witness said,
had been sent over the head of his su

speech, untrammeled criticism of the
military government and absolute inde

Looking for Him. .
Dr. Rudolph Schimpe, a wealthy resi
dent of St. Paul, who has been a guest
at the Occidental Hotel lince July last,
returned to that hostelry yesterday after
an absence of several days, and found to
his surprise that he had been accounted
in his own town as missing for several
weeks. :V
Dr. Schimpe is a chemist of consider
able note and is the president of a bric
quettt company, in whose interest he
camÂ«? to the coast. Several days ago he
decided to pay a visit to friends in Oak
land and immediately carried out his in
tentions by crossing the bay. He forgot
to mention to the clerks at the Occidental
that he -was going to be away. Two days
apo the local police received from St.
Paul a request to locate the doctor, the
explanation for' the Inquiry being that he
had not been heard from for some time,
and his friends and relatives were con
tiderably worried about his safety.
Hardly had the local sleuths started
cut en a hunt for the supposed missing
man before he returned to his hottl. The
doctor was unable to suggest a reason
why the anxiety had been aroused in St.
Paul.

no present intention of sending 1 the
â¢Yo'ungnusb'and expedition through to
L'Hassa, the capital of Thibet,' or even
of permanently occupying Gyangtse,
which is the second town in* importance
in Thibet. On his arrival at Gyangtse
Colonel Younghusband, It is said, hopes
to^be able, to reopen negotiations with
the Thibetans. There Is ; no j question,
however, that preparations are being
made for all emergencies. The military
arrangements are Intrusted to Colonel
MacDonald./who. was with the allied
forces in China. Immense quantitiesof
transport, stores and warm clothing are
being collected, â¢ including^, fur coats,
purchased for the J troops' f n China!
which are being sent from 'Tientsin, as

and that engagements have taken place

In. private letters just received from
the same place it is said that the jails
of Panama are full of political prison
ers who protested against the seces
sion of Panama from Colombia.
It Is stated that the news that pass
ports were refused by Colombia to pas
sengers for Costa. Rica (Puerto Lhnon)
is unfounded. The refusal of such
passports Is from the present Govern
ment of Panama, which fears discon
tented persons may return in arms by
way of the Costa Rican frontier.

GUERRILLA WARFARE BEGINS.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 30.â Germany
has recognized Panama as a sovereign
and independent state.
Several days ago, when the- German
Government inquired of Minister
Bunau-Varilla whether Panama would
carry out the treaty stipulations of the
existing conventions between Germany
and Colombia, the Minister replied that
his Government readily assumed these
obligations so far as they affected the
territory over which the republic of
Panama exercised sovereignty, but
that the Panama Government must
necessarily exempt from this pledge
the canal -strip, over which the Hay-
Bunau-Varilla treaty grants sovereign
rights, powers and authority to the
United States. The German Govern
ment readily assented to this exemp
tion, thus signifying her approval of
this provision of the new canal treaty.
Formal Notification Is Given the Re
public of Panama.

Footpad Presents Revolver at Miss
Tillie 0 swell, but Runs When
Escort Appears.
To look into the muzzle of an ugly
looking revolver in the hands of a deter
mined thug, intent upon robbery, and
then have the fellow humbly apologize,
claiming that he had made a mistake,
was the unusual experience of Miss Tillie
Oswell, a danseuse, employed at the Star
Theater, Sll Kearny street- The affair
took place at the corner of Montgomery
avenue and Jackson street, Saturday
'night, about 8 o'clock, and it was only
the timely arrival of the young woman's
escort, who had stopped for a moment
to speak to a friend, that prevented the
crook from securing a purse containing
several dollars.
Miss Oswell in discussing the affair said
she was on her way to the theater ia com
pany with Will Fisher, an officer of Com
'pariy A, Tenth Infantry, U. S. A., and as
they were crossing Montgomery avenue
her escort halted to converse with a sol
dier. She walked on and was startled by
an evil-looking man who stepped out
from the shadow of a building, covered
her with a revolver and ordered her to
throw up her hands. At this Juncture
Fisher approached and fha highwayman
returned the gun to his pocket. Then
gallantly lifting hU hat he beggred her
pardon and disappeared in the darkness.

here.' I did not know but that he
might have another revolver with^
him."
Mrs. Coit then told of the arrival of
Drs. Shiels, Whitney and Ma'rtln and
the removal of Major McClung from
the scene of the tragedy.
Mrs. Coit was then asked if she
knew of the motive that brought Gar
nett to her apartments, last Wednes
day.
"I can only surmise," she replied.
"From his manner I feel that he came
there prepared to do me harm. He
was crazy. He has acted very strange
ly for the last three months since my
return from Europe. He was very mo
rose and ugly."
WAS NOT BUSINESS AQENT.
. Mrs. Colt was then asked if Garnett
was her business agent, and she stated
that he was not. She explained that
he attended, to some little details of
business for her and that he had se
cured the lease of the Brooklyn Hotel,
which is Mrs. Colt's property. She ex
plained that a stipulation of the lease
was that Garnett should receive his
lodging and board at the hotel.
.Mrs. Coit further stated, that Gar
nett was not Daid any salary by her.
She said that while she was in Europe
she had instructed her bankers to al
low Garnett $5 a month to cover the
cost of postage on business letters to
her pr for cables in case It was neces
sary to telegraph her.
Coroner Leland then asked Mrs. Colt
if she knew of any reason why Garnett
should have tried to harm her.
"The only thing I can surmise," she
answered, , "is that Garnett fancied I
would give orders that he should not
be allowed to live at the. Brooklyn Ho
tel. We were playing bridge whist
some days before the shooting and he
insulted and swore at mÂ§ over the
game. I told him to leave my rooms
and not to call on me again. He wrote
me some letters apologizing for his con
duct, but I did not answer them. Mr.
Bradley, my attorney, and Major Mc-
Clung knew of this, and they both ask
ed me to forgive Garnett and be friend
ly with him again.
"Major McClung told me that he had
met, Garnett on the street and that
Garnett had said to him: that he was
going away, as he had lost everything.
I suppose, that Garnett thought that
on account of his conduct to me I
would say something to the Brooklyn
Hotel people to cause them to ask him
to leave the hotel, but I never dreamed
of doing so. That Is the only thing I
can think of that, would cause Garnett
to try to harm me."
GARNETT ALWAYS FRIENDLY.
District Attorney Byington then
asked Mrs. Coit ] If she had ever seen
Garnett display or carry a pistol before
and she answered:
: ; "I only saw him with a revolver when
he was up on my ranch this summer
and he then had my revolver. I knew,
however, that he owned a pistol."
District Attorney Byingtonâ Did Gar
nett ever threaten you?
Mrs. Coit- No, he did not.
District Attorney Byingtonâ Did Gar
nett ever intimate a threat : toward
you?
"Â¦- Mrs. -.'Coltâ No, he was always very
friendly to me. ~
. Coroner Lelandâ After the conduct of
Garnett that led you to refuse : to re
ceive him .at your . rooms, did Major
McClung attend to any business for
you . that Garnett fprmerly looked
after?
% Mrs. Coltâ Na -Major McClung ; r 'did
not attend' to any-business for me. \
.Coroner Lelandâ Is . there anything
else you can think of that can'throw
light on r this. matter? : . â¢ '
Airs. Coitr-No, I cannot think of any
thing. '" I have done my best to tell you
all- 1, can remember of this terrible af
fair. It -was awful. Garnett is crazy.
He was very friendly toward Major
McClung and had no reason whatever,
to harm him. He would have done' the

"Viceroy Alexieff, addressing 3 his
staff, said that if Russia had three
docks at Port Arthur and two at Dalny
she would not hesitate to fight Japan,
but as things stood it would be impos
sible to annihilate a fleet in the first
engagement, while a second encounter
would mean certain defeat, if "not, the
annihilation of the Russian fleet. For
this reason, the Viceroy said, war with
Japan would not be advisable."
The Asahi's correspondent adds that
many of the principal warships of
Russia are badly in need of repairs,
whLch cannot be accomplished in the
present unsettled condition of affairs.
Consequently, Viceroy Alexieff said,
he was strongly in favor of peace.

that "caused us to advance from the
middle of the room toward him.
Coroner Lelandâ Did â¢ Garnett make
any threat to you at that time? .
Mrs. Coitâ No, he did not; he did not
speak at all, but hie had a terrible look
on his face and in his eyes.
Coroner- Lelandâ What took place
when Major McClung- and yourself ad
vanced, toward Garnett? i?-l%
Mrs. Coltâ The first thjng I saw was
that; Garnett was undoing his vest. I
wondered what he was doing and then
he pulled a revolver from inside his
vest and held it high above his head.
Coroner Lelandâ Had Major McClung
made any threat toward Garnett or
laid his hands on him up to the time
Garnett pulled the revolver?
Mrs. Coitâ He certainly had not. As
soon as Garnett displayed the revolver
Major McClung took hold of him. The
major had one hand on Garnett's chest
and clutched Garnett's arm that was
in the air holding tha pistol. Major
McClung said to Garnett, "For God's
sake. Alec, what are you doing? "^Don't
act like a crazy man; gfve me that pis
tol." They struggled from the doorway
toward the little table standing against
the wall about six feet away. I was
on the left of the two men near the
wall. I said to Gamut, "What are you
doingâ are you crazy? For God's sake
put away that pistol." Then L Major
McClung said to Garnett, "Look out,
you will knock over that little table,"
and Garnett replied, "Damn the table."
The table was knocked over in the
struggle and then I saw Garnett's hand
that held the pistol in the air come
down and then" I heard' a shot fired. | I
cannot say whether Garnett released
the arm that Major McClung held or if
the major became tired and could not
hold the arm with the pistol any longer.
CI/INGS TO THE PISTOL.
Coroner Lelandâ What took place
immediately after the shooting?
Mrs. Coitâ The major reeled toward the
windows and rested against the chair
and said, "Madam, I am shot." Garnett
came toward me with the pistol in his
hand. His hand was shaking, but he
held the pistol toward me. I said to
him: "The major is shot, and I don't
care now if you kill me." Garnett did
? not answer me, but he dropped his
hand with the pistol, but still kept hold
of the weapon. I turned toward Major
McClung as he reeled into a rocking
chair and he said, "For God's sake, get
a doctor. I am feeling badly; I am
wounded here," as he pointed to his
breast. I assisted Major McClung to
his feet and started to help him to the
end door of the room, but Garnett got
between us and locked the door. <5ar
nett never spoke a word to us. I got
Major McClung back to the' rocking
chair and he undid his vest and I saw
blood on his shirt. I said to Garnett,
"Get a doctor; the major is shot," but
he did not answer me. I went to the
middle door where the telephone is,
but â¢ Garnett followed me in there, and
threw me aside and forced me out of
the little room. I shut the door and
tried to hold him in there, but I was
not strong . enough, to do so, and he
came .out into .this room. I ' again
begged Garnett to get a doctor and he
opened the door leading into the hall-,
way. I rushed by him and got 'out -into
the corridor and balled to a bellboy, who
was some* distance away, to get ja doc
tor. One' of the maids, named* Nora,
had called at .the door and knocked at
it when Garnett opened the "door.' I
told her to go for a doctor also.: .While
I was sitting on the lounge in the cor
ridor near my rooms Garnett came up
to me. t He still had the pistol ' in ' his

' Coroner 'Leland â What did he say to

Mrs. Coitâ He said, "I have shot

used. Â¦ Then he : said, "I will spare "your

thÂ« etatlon by the entire embassy staff.
SONOMA, Nov. 30.â Fred Goess, pro-*
prietor of the Golden West Hotel, shot
his wife in the head to-night and then
killed himself.
Shortly after 6 o'clock Goess quar
reled with his wife, and as a result
drew a revolver, firing a shot which
took effect behind her left ear. Mr3.
Goess fell to the floor and her hus
band, thinking she was dead, turned
the six-shooter on himself. He .died
instantly.
"The Goesses had been married about
a year, and temporary Insanity is
thought to have been the immediate
cause of the. tragedy. Mrs. Goess,

An ample allowance of ammunition

is recommended. Further it is recom
mended.tl.at all target practice, except

proximating those of actual service.
The report says three ranges should be

Having been balked at every, turn by
the more speedy and j effective move
ments of the missing man, the police
find solace In the perusal' of the much
delayed official notice Hodgkins has is
sued for the guidance of peace, officers
throughout the country. That circular
makes a special reference to; Kiniry as
an expert porch-climbing, burglar. Kin-,
lry, by the way, has traveled during his
recent stay in these parts under va
rious names. . '...
Chief Hodgkins officially declares
that David Kiniry is the ; man , he. is
looking for. .In San Francisco Joseph
McKinlry appears to have been the fu
gitlye's name, but he looms up a , third
time as David Kanary and also as Da
vid Kinnlry. Small matters these, but
important to the work of '-. trailing the
man.
At police headquarters the hopeless
attitude of the Chief of Police has been
reflected in the detectives and. the nu
merous, patrolmen who "" have labored
hard, even If handicapped, to land their
man. The detectives feel . that the
chance of locating and capturing the
object of search has- become,, to say the
least, very re .iote. "They have conclud
ed ._. vat Kiniry made -for the State
boundary â¢ lines, but in "what: direction
they have been unable to determine. ;
The "subordinate members of the. Po-'

parent 'utter hopelessness of the case.

sible to uncover facts. that I. would be' of
assistance. iBut, as_Â»ln. the : efforts > of

SOLACE FOB POLICE.
It was within the range of^ most or
dinary commonplace police" business
that this place should be most carefully
watched. The first opportunity to cap
ture Kiniry in Oakland had been ir
retrievably lost. To guard with utmost
vigilance the .Oak-street residence was
the move that might have ended this
search had it been made by proper de
tective methods. On Saturday even
ing two. men called at the Thompson
residence and requested that mall for
Kiniry and Goldstein be turned over to
them. Here was a connecting link that
seemed so strong to Attorney Thomp
son that he said he almost cried from
vexation because there were no detec
tives nor policemen at hand.
"So strongly did I feel about this
failure to get these men," said Thomp
son, .-"that I was tempted to follow
them and try to turn them over, to a
policeman. But I recalled the des
perate nature of the affair in Oakland,
where two men went to their death,
and I desisted. If the police of Oak
land had arranged to have my, house
properly guarded I believe the arrest
of these strangers would have ..led to
the capture of Kiniry. These men were
undoubtedly in touch with him. Other
wise, why should they call to inquire
for his mall?"

Tracing Chief, of Police .Hodgkins'
movements from, the moment/ the
murder of. Policeman Smith was reporU
ed to him at 6:30 o'clock Friday even
ing, there appears a remarkable slow
ness. It is a fact that the heSd of the
Oakland Police Department had inform
ation as to the rooming place of Gold
stein and Kiniry in this city within two
hours after, the shooting. Indeed, be
fore .this time had passed 'Ross Stead
man, at" whose home, 1362 Grove street,
the pair resided, had furnished Hodg
kins with that information. But so
slow was the department executive in
getting his orders into shape that Kiniry
had time to go to the house, help him
self to such belongings as he cared to
take with him, write a note to.Gold
stein, of whose . death he had not
learned, in all likelihood, and get away.
There was the "chance to capture this
man, for whom this city and San Fran
cisco were scoured after it was too late.

On the validity of a similar statute
affecting private employment, Justice
Harlan said:
Whether a similar statute, applied to laborers
or employes in purely private work would be
constitutional, is a question of very large im
r-TTi which we have no occasion now to de
termine or. even to consider.
If it be contended to be the right o' any
one to dlepoee of his labor on. sucn tenns as
he deems best â as undoubtedly it i> â and that
to make it a criminal offense for a contractor
for public work to permit or require his em
ployes to perform labor upon work in ex
cess of <-.(.-!. t hours each day Is In derogation
o* the liberty of employe* and employers, it
is sufficient answer that no one Is entitled, of
absolute right and as a part of his liberty, to
perform labor for the State, and no contractor
for public work can excuse a violation of his
lawful agreement with the State by doing that
which the statute under which te proceeds
distinctly forbids him to do.
So also if it be eald that a ctatute like
the one before Us is mischievous in its
dencies tfie answer is that the responsibility
therefor fwts upon the legislators, not upon
c->orts- Xo evils arising from such legisla
tion could be more far-reaching th&b those
t!;at miÂ£ht come to our cystem o;!' government
if the Judiciary, abandoning- the sphere as
f rn'.d to it by the fundamental law, should
enter, the domain of ' legislation and upon
crounds merely of Justice or reason or wis
â¢4 rr>, annul rtatutps that had received the
Â¦auction of the people's representative*. We
are reminded by counsel that It is the solemn
duty of the courts In cases' before them to
guard the constitutional rights of the citizens
against merely arbitrary power. That Is un
questionably true But It Is equally true â
indeed the public interests imperatively de
mand â that legislative enactments be recog
nized and enfoÂ«-ced by the courts as embody
ing the will of the people, unless they are
plainly ar.d culpably berond ail question vio
lation of the fundamental law of the constitu
tion. It cannot be affirmed by tho statute of
Kansas that it is plainly Inconsistent with
that instrument, indeed its constitutionality is
beyond all' queston.
STATE IS RESPONSIBLE-
Taking up the question of public pol
icy. Justice Harlan said:
The Kansas law whose validity was
called into Question in the suit was en
acted in 1891 and provided that eight
hours should constitute a day's work
for workmen employed by or on be
half of the State, or by any county or
city or other municipality in the State.
It also prohibits contractors from re
quiring laborers engaged on work for
the State to perform more than eight
hours' labor In a day. Both fine and
Imprisonment are provided for viola
tion of the law. The case decided to
day was that of W. W. Atkins vs.
the State of Kansas. Atkins had a
contract with the corporation of Kan
sas City, Kans., for paving, and he
was charged with requiring a workman
named Reese to labor ten hours a day.
He was prosecuted in the State courts,
where the decisions were uniformly
against him. Atkins appealed from the
decision of the State Supreme Court to
the Federal Supreme Court, alleging
that the statute is in violation of the
first f;fct!on of the fourteenth amend
ment to the constitution, in that It de
nied to him protection of the law and
deprived him of his property without
ttue proceFS.
(JUSTICE HARLAJTS OPINION.
Referring to the only other decision
of the court on the eight-hour question,
that of Holden vs. Hardy, in which the
court sustained the law of Utah, fix
ing an eight-hour day for miners em
ployed underground. Justice Harlan
called attenti6n td the fact that while
In the Utah case private interests were
Involved, the present case involves em
ployment on public work only; The
opinion vras based on the -theory, that
the municipalities of the State are
creations cf the -State; that work for
them is of a public character and does
not infringe on the personal liberty of
any one. He then added:
Whatever may have b-Â»en the motives that
controllÂ«Â»d th* enactment cf thÂ«- statute la ques
tion we can imagine no possible jrround to dis
pute the power of the Stale to df-clare that no
one undertaklDjf work for It or lor "one ol
Â»8 municipal ae:enc!<*g shall permit cf require
any employe en * uch work tr> labor in escess
of eight hours Â«Â»&ch day, ana to Inflict punish
ment uixm contractors who disregard such a,
regulation. It cannot be deemed a part of
the liberty of the contractor that he be al
lowed to do public work in any mode he may
choose to adopt, without regard to the wlgh.es
of the istate. On the contrary it belongs to
the Stale, aÂ« the guardian and trusleÂ« for its
people, to pr*>*cribe the conditions upon which
it wili jiermlt public work to be done. No
court Las authority to review its Â¦ action in
that. respect. Regulation* on this subject eug
g*tt only considerations of public policy and
with Â«>uch considerations the courts have no
concern.
WASHINGTON, Nov. SO.â The United
States Supreme Court to-day affirmed
the constitutionality of the eight-hour
law of the State of Kansas, regulating
labor on public works. Justice Harlarf
Bald in handing down the opinion that
if the statute were mischievous the.re
sponsibility rested with the Legislature
and not the courts. Chief Justice
Fuller and Justices Brewer and Peck
ham dissented.
This Is the story that Jordan himself
tells, and he has told it more than once
around Oakland since the battle of the
ballot machines began. At any rate,
Jordan still represents the United
States Standard ballot .machine.
In addition to this Btory.- Jordan told
another In which Governor. Pardee fig
ured to the Board of Supervisors. 'This
Is the way Jordan told it to the Ala
meda Supervisors:
"Governor Pardee * : asked . me to show
him how a straight ballot was voted
on my machine, and I showed him, Just
as I am showing you gentlemen. As I
voted a straight ballot for. his benefit
the. Governor remarked, 'Frank, that
is the first time you ever ' voted a
straight ballot In your life.' ' I looked
at him and replied, 'Governor, there are
others,* and the subject was dropped
right there."
But the little ruffle in State affairs is
a mere ripple* to -what, Is going* on in
Alameda : County., Political '[ features
are being traded in every direction for
votes for the ballot machines, deals are
being made, first on one side and then
on the other, and. as the .two.' machine
promoters : are both residents : of Ala-
Governor Pardee had a legal, moral
and political right to take the hand
that he did. He had a legal right be
cause the law that authorized ballot
machines In California made him ex
offido a member of the commission that
was to Daes upon the ballot machines
that were to bo submitted to the boards
of Supervisors for selection. He had
a moral right as the head of the State
government and he had a political
right as the head of his party and the
head of the Republican administration,
to which party both of the rival ma
chine promoters belonged.
So Governor Pardee sent for Jordan.
Mr. Jordan was sent for In several ca
pacities. In the first place Governor
Pardee and Frank C. Jordan, then
County Clerk of Alameda County, used
to "do politics" together in Oakland.
In the second place Jordan, is a mem
ber of the Republican administration
of the State of California, of which
Governor Pardee is the head. In the
third place Governor Pardee is a mem
ber of the ballot machine commission
and Jordan is a ballot machine pro
moter. So in all of these capacities Jor
dan called upon the Governor. â¢ The
Governor and the clerk of the Supreme
Court looked at each other.
"Frank." said the Governor, "do you
think It looks Just right for a -member
of the State administration to be trying
to sell. ballot machines to counties in
the State?" ' i:
'. "Doc," replied the Clerk of -the Su
preme Court, who knew the Governor
lu fhe days of his medical practice,' "it
is a great deal better that I should die
with a wad than without any. There
is a little matter between us, and there
can never be a settlement unless I
make that wafi."
HIS FIRST STRAIGHT VOTE.
GOVERNOR INTERFERES.
It was just about this time that Gov
ernor George C. Pardee took a hand in
affairs.
Whatever the fact may be, Jordan
next made his appearance as the rep
resentative of the United States Stand
ard machine and State Senator Frank
W. Leavitt appeared as the manager
of the Columbia machine, and it be
came State official against t State offi
cial In the contest to see 'which one
could place the greatest number of bal
lot machines In the control of the va
rious county Supervisors.^--".,
The stockholders of the Columbia
Ballot Machine Company say that Jor
dan Injured their sample machine so
that it would not work and then aban
doned them for the rival concern. Jor
dan retaliates by saying that he dis
covered that the Columbia machine
would not work and he abandoned it
of his own free will.
During the session of the Supervis
ors of the State the Columbia ballot
machine failed to work and Jor
dan abandoned its management and
became the manager of the United
States Standard ballot m'achine.
Frank Jordan took this machine to
the convention of Supervisors that was
held at Martinez a very few months
ago, and he was there booked to read
an address upon "Voting Machines."
Then came the first hitch. There
were two hitches, in fact. One was
with the Columbia ballot machine and
the other was with F. C. Jordan.
MACHINE FAILS TO WORK.
The trouble began when Frank C.
Jordan, Clerk of the Supreme Court,
was chosen manager for the Columbia
Ballot Machine Company of Indiana
polis, Ind. While this company has its
headquarters in the Hjosier city, it is
really, an Oakland concern. This is
the famous "Christensen machine" that
figured before a session of the State
Legislature several years agd. It is
backed, largely, by George W. Reed
and Emil Nusbaumer of Oakland with
various and sundry stockholders scat
tered from Oakland to the East.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Nov. 30.
.-The battle of the ballot machines,
now in progress In Alameda County,
is of more than local interest and be
fore it is finished it bids fair to in
volve personages of local. State and
even national consequence. Not only
is the local political atmosphere thor
oughly charged with the ballot ma
chine electricity, but the galvanism has
reached even to the Capital at Sacra
mento.
The contest before the local Super
visors has been one for a big contract
that Involved the expenditure of a
great deal of money, and this contract
has threatened to disrupt party and
faction in Alameda County. State of
ficial is arrayed against State official.
Political factions are being brought
into conflict over the question of which
machine shall be chosen, positions,
nominations and political influence are
being traded and bartered, while po
litical futures are being wrecked and
m.ade.
THREE-INCH GUN
IN HIGH ESTEEM
The premises in which the fire started
is a rookery occupied by Louis
Cereghino; his mother, Mrs. Jennie
Cereghino, two brothers and two sis
ters. .The latter are 14 and 10 years of
age and the boys are 18 and 4 years old.
Cereghino is engaged in the manufac
ture of shoe blacking, and the flames
started around a range of which the
material containing much combustible
matter is boiled. SSfP
The mother and the three younger
children were In a room on the second
floor when the flre broke out, cutting
off their escape from the street. They
rushed to a door that opens Into a small
court in the rear and from which a
stairway runs down to the 'first floor.
The blaze was then coming out of the
lower windows and the shaft was filled
with smoke and heat. The womanv
with the baby in her arms, and the two
girls clinging to her, shouted for help,
and neighbors rushed from adjoining
houses to her assistance. As they were
half carried down the burning stairway
their hair and hands were badly- burned.
Louis was in the street when the flre
started and, not realizing the -peril of
those inside, first rushed to Kearny
and Pacific streets to turn in an'alarm.
When he returned some one told .him
that his baby brother had not yet been
taken out and he rushed blindly into
the burning structure to save him.
When Cereghino entered the front
room, the floor, eaten by the flre, gave
way under his feetÂ»and he was dragged
A>ut by two men who had followed him
in. - His clothing and hands were
burned. The property loss will amount
to about $2000.
The elder son of the woman crashed
through a burning floor and was slight
ly burned In an effort to save his
younger brother he supposed was still
in the burning building, gfn
Mrs. Jennie Cereghino and her three
children had a escape from
death in flames that broke out early
last evening in a building at 3 St.
Charles place, a blind alley off Kearny
street, near Pacific. The fire gained
such rapid headway before an alarm
could be sent in that it was with dif
ficulty that the tfiembers'of the family
weie rescued.
The Weyerhaeusers have invested
more than J6.000.000 in timber lands on
the coast. The greater part of . their
holdings are in the State of Washing
ton, some are in Oregon, and In this
State they control the Navarre prop
erty, purchased last year through a
company at the head of which is Mr.
Moon, son-in-law of one of the Weyer
haeusers. McCormick and several as
sociates also own 1,200,000 acres of tim
ber land in the three coast States,
which may be counted In with the
Weyerhaeuser interests.
These holdings also include many
mills with which the Weyerhaeusers.
If they carry out their threat, -will be
able to give their competitors a lively
race for business. A number of the
local representatives of the larger
milling companies against which - the
Weyerhaeusers would enter into Inde
pendent competition in the event of a
break in the combine have expressed
the opinion that all existing difficulties
will be adjusted at the next meeting
of the exporters, "when a new combine
for the ensuing year Is arranged. Me-
Cormlck's arrival here is awaited with
much Interest, however. T .
MH.I*I0NS INVESTED.
Suddenly, however, the representa
tives of the company began to com
plain, and not being satisfied with the
responses made to their complaints. R.
L. McCormlck, secretary of the big con
cern, notified several of the larger firms
here that the Weyerhaeusers were de
termined to get a better share of the
business, which they considered they
were entitled to, and if they failed they
would withdraw from the combine and
enter the business for themselves. Sec
retary McCormick hinted that the Wls*
consin milionaires. whom he represents,
were prepared to buy or build their own
vessels and would ply from all the big
coast ports and those of foreign coun
tries where Pacific Coast lumber is now
in demand.
A report received here yesterday Is
to the effect that McCormlck Is now on
his way to this city, fully prepared to
carry out the threat. He is accom
panied by another representative of
the big firm andMs due to arrive here
in a few days from the north, by which
route he is coming.
' The bulk of the export lumber trade
of the "entire Pacific Coast originates in
this city; that is, all the larger lumber
firms have their agencies here and
through a combine, which is effected
annually, they try to apportion orders
for export among the numerous mills In
California, -Oregon and Washington.
The Wftyerhaeuser Timber Company
has been a member of this combine for
many months and until recently seemed
to be well satisfied with the share of
export business that was given It.-
THBEATENS BIO ITRBIS.
The Weyeihaeusers, known through
out the Wes'.ern hemisphere as the
Rockefellers of the lumber world, are
threatening to enter San Francisco as a
competitor to the balance of the lumber
firms engaged In the exportation of Pa
cific Coast lumber. The Wisconsin mil
lionaires have a grievance against the
Pacific Coast exporters, which they
have plainly broached, and followed it
up- with a threat that if they are not
accorded fairer treatment than at pres
ent they will break away from the com
bine of millmen that now governs, the
export business and with vessels of
their own will Inaugurate warfare to
the bitter end.

RELATIVES IN UTAH.
Detective Denny Holland, who has
returned from Los Angeles, believes
that Goldstein a<nd Kiniry were respon
sible for some of the clever burglaries
that have bothered the police ' of the
Southern California city. Holland said:
"The Los Angeles police have no
doubt, in view of the disclosures ' in
Oakland,- that these men 'worked* that
city. There have been a large number
of crimes there like the Crellln and
Banrian burglaries here and the -Mor
gan affair in Berkeley. .It looks as if
Goldstein and , Kiniry were very -well
acquainted with what- is needed -for
that kind- of work."
Kiniry, it has been learned, -work
ed at his trade as a carpenter In San
Francisco for some time prior to the
departure from that city of the Gold
stein family for Los Angeles. When
he resided with them at 204 Turk
street, San Francisco, where Mrs. K.
Greiner, Goldstein's mother, conducted
a lodging-house, Kiniry was appar
ently all that would commend a moth
er to recommend him as a companion
for her son. To the Oakland police
Mrs. Greiner spoke in highest termsof
Kiniry, extolling him as a steady
and industrious young man whom she
was glad to have with her boy. The
revelations of the last three days sim
ply appalled her. Mrs. Greiner ad
mitted that her son had Leen much un
der the control^ of Kiniry during
their three years' acquaintanceship, but
she also declared that- no doubt she
had been completely deceived. *Â¦
Goldstein was killed by the police officer
after being mortally wounded by Klnlry. who
immediately made his escape.
For several years Kiniry and his partner.
Frank J. Goldstein, have been pals. Goldstein
was a resident of Los Angeles, Cal. He and
Klnlry well known there.

'During the past j'ear" the Bureau of
Soils has-been engaged in making*'al
kali reclamation demonstrations in. the
arid .West.'- Referring to an extensive
Â¦experiment located near Salf Lake,
where'a'n area of.75.000 acres isunpr,o
.ductive- because .of .an excess of alkali,
a tract of forty acres was secured and
the work of reclamation in co-operation
with the- Utah experiment station 'was
Â¦ undertaken. At the -beginning this
-tract was. fouild. to contain more than
-Vz X>er cent of salt, or a total of 6650
tons in four feet of soil. Two-thirds
of this quantity^ has now .been removed
by 'the simple method '-of- under drain
age .and flooding. It is -believed that
the entire area .will, be sufficiently
sweetened by the end of the present
â¢season to" permit growing a crbp.
Examinations and reports dealing
with technical problems -in the forest
reserves .have been made for reserves
in. T'tah;' California, Oregon and New
Mexico. Representatives of the bureau
have, during the past sunimer, exam
ined, over 120,000,000 acres, proposed as
forestry reserves in the Rocky Moun
tains and Pacific Coast States.
Discussing- the balance. of trade, the
Secretary shows that the favorable
balance to the credit of the country 'is
due entirely to the farmers. The bal
ance of trade In favor of farm products
during the last fourteen years, no year
excepted,- aggregated $4,806,000,000. In
products other than of the farm during
the same period the balance of trade
was adverse to this country to the ex
tent of $865,000,000.

extinguished the blaze. Holland's hands'
were badly burned and Hawkins was

The Herald, frcm the inception of this plot,
has steadfastly crroced lta consummation, and
with untiring real soueht to unmask the crim
inals. The Herald waa the first paper In
Grand BsdMs to expose the Bartln deal la
Chicago and was the first to demand the Jury
investigation. The Herald continued to urge
the summoning- of the Grand Jury until it waa
called, and wan relentless in demanding the
full exDosure of the plot and the punishment
of the ci'nsnlraU.rs.

THE MAYOR INVOLVED.
Perry's theory was for him and the Demo
crat (a local paper) to support the Bailey
Springs water project, a rival of the Lake
Michigan deal. He advocated the Bailey
Springs deal with the sole purpose of getting
the other papers to oppose the project, before
it was known that . the " other papers would
accept money. -' Burch ; of the Evening Pr*-ss
at first wanted *10,OCO t but rtnally took the
$5000. I insisted that * nothing tv* done by
the Council '. until the : additional $75,000, for
which we had bargained with the promoters,
came. Attorney McGarry first got held of this
money, but I insisted . that it be turned over
to Stilsen Â¦ McLeod, an Â¦ employe of the old
National Bank7- with whom I haa - been â¢ in
terested in stock Â¦ speculations. Method took.
$15,300 to make up his shortage \ and I , got'
$12,000 and paid up Miy i debts. The rest was
kept â¢ , by McLeod at. the old National- Bank.
My Idea yet was to call: the whole^ water, deal
off and let those fellows go back to Ntw York
thinking that -they had done something.
Salsbury Bald; that; the reason." he, dM
.not get out of the' deal : af ter getting,
the first boodie was that he had to keep
up an appearance of good faith with
the promoters, and, .because of the
drains upon him in interesting other
persons, he was unable to get enough
out of It for himself to' pay up his $15,
000 shortage. After paying McGarry
17500, so he testified,' he went down to
ex-Mayor Perry's office and gave him
$3333. Salsbury continued:

In a signed : ; statement ; E. D. Conger,
We had bidder* on the string from all sides
and our first plan was to ret them to put up
all the money possible with us as bribe money
and then po to the Council ' and exhibit the
money with the statement that It was sent
here to bribe us and then keep it. This was
before â¢ the water deal waa planned and our
first plan would have gone through but for
my arrest In Chicago, which scared some of
them out. We, had bidders In Milwaukee,
Omaha, Chicago- and "other places, and were
Just getting them warmed up - when my ar
rest in Chicago upset all the plans.
. The next plan was. to get the . city to buy
the hydraulic water plant. It was practically
worthless ro far as competition was , concerned,
but could 'be made to nppear good.' In order
to . get the deal through It i was necessary to
have the city charter amended 'and for this
purpose we had to arrange â¢ with ' Senators
Burns and Otis. Messrs. Crow and a Mr. Gray
of ' New York were to back the scheme and
were to put â¢ up $60,000 as a starter. . Willard
*KlhgsIey of this city acted for them.
Â¦ Of thig amount we -were > to give $10,000 to
Editor Conger, $5000 to Senator Burns, $30,000
wag Uo - go to carry the Legislature for the
bin. and the balance of $15,000 was to be
divided' between Mayor Perry," Kditor Sproal,"
Oeorg-e Ellis and myself. - This plan fell down,
however, â¢ when a 'Â¦ referendum I clause was " atÂ»
tached to the bill ' and we had. to give it. up
and Ko on with the Lake Michigan deal.

The Greek Theater at Berkeley has
put all kinds of queer notions into
the Californian head. Possibly "I O U"
Is one of them. It has been determined
by the Berkeley enthusiasts that the
Greek Theater shall be the cradle of
the national drama. Last night Fisch
er's offered a home-made burlesque in
"I O U" that Gotham may be glad to
Import. â¢ '
In the intervals of being a secretary
of Railroad Commissions and things
and things and things, it is said that
Judson C. Brusie has found time to
write the burlesque. Dr."H. J. Stewart
has made the music and the piece is
staged by Charles H. Jones, and if the
sputter of laughs that greeted it last
night be anything to go by "I O.U"
goes! Mr. Brusie knows his Fischer's.
Mr. Brusie knows also his audience.
The fun and situations of the burlesque"
are all of the minute and fitted to
every rib of the Fischer folk. Nor has
Dr. Stewart done his part less effec
tively. The music is bright, vlf, and
suited to the piece and people. And
the burlesque is excellently . staged. It
went almost without a hitch.
The pivot of the fun is the labor
union, with trusts and hotel-keeping as
side issues, and the author has achieved
a Gilbertian. touch in their handling.
Here is his- definition of a corporation:
"A corporation is an aggregation of
men sanctioned by law to do what in
dividuals wouldn't dare to do." Of
trusts he says:
"Corporations eat up companies.
Companies eat up co-partnerships,
Co-partnerships, eat up individuals,
And trusts eat up the whole cheese."
But Mr. Brusie is at his funniest
when dealing with the eccentricities of
unionism. Kolb, Dill and Bernard be
come partners in a hotel-keeping en
terprise, after a delightfully tangled
contract. Help/is short, and the part
ners turn to and "do everything from
clerking to barkeeping. The walking
delegate, very humorously exaggerated
by Ben T. Dillon, then comes along and
persuades them forcibly to Join eight
unions apiece, in their several capaci
ties. He then informs them of a labor
parade to be held the following day,
for which they are fined $50 by every
union which they fall to represent.
Truly" Gilbert! Then Dill, objecting
that his partners have opened the shop
two seconds before time, and closed It
four seconds after hours, strikes. Kolb
explains that as laundrymaa Dill un
reasonably objects to washing anything
but union suits! But the short
man goes away and returns inside a
sandwich with the inscription: "Boycott
This House!" His march In front of
the Dew Break Ipn, chanting -"This is
an' unfair house!" is the kind of climax
called screaming.
Miss Amber as a circus lass and Mr.
Blake as a gentlemanly Circus proprie
tor gone gray take care of most of the
lyrics. "Here's to the Little Tin Pail,"
sung by Blake, set the feet stamping,
and Miss Amber has a fetching tune in
"Am I Dreaming?" The fun trust has
three songs, and the chorus has some
excellent numbers, notably the finale of
the first act, the opening chorus and !
closing ensembte of the second act.

lyrics, but the whole setting is of much

â¢weighing twenty tons will be erected
by Alabamfc, in the mines and metal

colossal statue will be forty-five feet
high and It will ; be a work\of art. It
will be cast entirely of Alabama iron,
which runs like bronze in a liquid
state, and will be covered with a coat
of shellac. It will cost ?1 0,000, and after
the World's Fair will be erected In one
of the principal parks of Birmingham
as a permanent monument.
The grounds surrounding the Ken

cannas, roses, geraniums, etc., will be
planted in suitable places. The lawn
will be of the finest blue grass, which
will be sown this fall to make a heavy

will be sent from Kentucky: in . fact,
everything planted to beautify the

be obtained In Kentucky.
The Hottentots.
The Hottentots, who are giving thÂ«
German authorities in" Southwest Af
rica some trouble at present, are a cu
rious, wizened< yellow-faced tribe. As
far back as 1794 -a native regiment of
Hottentots was enrolled in Cape Colony,
by General Craig, and the present Cape
Mounted Rifles Is their lineal descend
ant. The Cape Colony Hottentots had
always been a cause- of anxiety to the
goveVnment, and In 1810 the last of their
chiefs who had authority, in the Cape
was deposed and sentenced to penal ser
vitude in chains for life. He escaped
into Kaffirland, but was recaptured and
sent as a convict to New South TVales,
where he died in 18S0. The Hottentot
is lazy, careless, and of light but active
build. There are about 73,000 of them
in the Cape Colony, but they are most
unlikely to give the authorities any
trouble in connection with the rislns of
their kinsmen In German territory. '

More Boxing Hints.
BX ALBERT PAYSOX TERHUNE.
[Athletic Expert New York Evening; 'World.
Author of "Muscle Euildinr." Etc.J
(Copyright, 1903. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
Boxing, as you have already seen,
depends fully as much on defensive as
on aggressive work. The man who de
fends himself badly is at the mercy of
any ordinarily good opponent. Whereas
the man whose attack is poor, but
whose defense is excellent, will often
\\in against a far more "showy" antag-
To-day's lesson, therefore, will deal
with the art of "ducking."
The sidestep, as. we have seen, car
ries the whole body-out of danger. The
"duck," on the other hand, protects
only the head. Often there is no time
to sidesfeD, and it Is not expedient to
guard with either hand. In such an in
stance the "duck" is a veritable boon
to the hard-pressed boxer.
In ducking (as in sidestepping and in
swinging) everything depends Â¦ on
speed, timeliness and perfect accuracy.
An awkward or- tardy execution of this
maneuver, or a duck at a crisis when
a guard with, the arm or a sidestep are
called for may lead to unpleasant con
sequences and may give the other man
Just the opening he has been playing
for. . . ?
If you study this lesson with especial
care, however, and follow faithfully its
instructions, you will, with a little
practice, easily master the art of duck
ing and will learn to avoid the few
pitfalls It sometimes involves.
Put on the gloves and let us begin.
(Remember, when drawing on the
"mitts" to use as much care and gen
tleness of treatment as though you
were donning your 53 550 Sunday pearl
kid gloves. In this way your boxing
gloves will last twice as long. It's not
boxing that knocks gloves to pieces
nearly so much as it is the carelessness
with which they are put on and off.)
Take the first position. On guard!
Go through all the points we have
studied up to the present, beginning
with the straight left lead for the
face. These "back lessons" must- all
be gone through with, dally, and es
pecially before taking up any new
points.
There are two regular ducks. They
are known as the "straight duck" and
the "duck to the side." We will take
up the "straight duck" first.
Let your sparring partner lead for
your face with his left As he loads
throw your hoad t<vlhe left and slight
ly forward. Throw it far enough to
the loft to enable it to avoid the other
man's lead, and then bring it around
In a sort of circle, still following the
leftward trend and bringing the hea-i
around until it completes the circle and
is once more in its normal position.
I can better make this clear by ask
ing you to try a little experiment. Hold
the. forefinger of the left hand vertical.
Now poke the forefinger of the right
hand at it vertically, aiming for the
top knuckle. As you do so describe a
circle with the end of the forefinger
of the left hand, bUII holding it verti
cally. You will see that. this finger tip
fs thus thrown forward as it nears the
end of the first half of the circle, and
that it returns to its former vertical
position as it completes its circle.
Meanwhile, however, the other forefin
ger which was aimed at it has missed
it entirely. The left forefinger tip cir
cled completely around it without be
ing touched.
'That is Just the way your head should
avoid a straight lead when you duck
straight. Throw the head to the left,
remember, In all straight ducks, and
let it come around, forward In a large
enough circle to avoid the blow.
Always duck quickly, yet never too
soon. For your sparring partner may
merely be "felntjng" to make you duck,
and if you fall into the trap he may
land on you at will while your eyes
are temporarily oflf his face. If you
duck too late you run into his blow.'
. When ducking a swing or a. hook re
member that the blow is not "traveling
straight forward, but is taking a sort
of half circle at right angles to the cir
cle your head is describing. 'Therefore
If you bring your head back to its nor
mal position. before the swing or hook
has wholly passed by, you are liable to
receive the full force of the blow on
your head or face. Many an amateur
has been knocked out through this mis
calculation. The ."duck to the side" we
will take ud in next Friday's issue.
A VERBATIM report is supplied by the Sacramento
Bee of an, address delivered by Governor Pardee to 1
the Sacramento city and county teachers which
easily rank3 in the forefront of utilitarian talks. The Gov\
ernor's theme was "The Eyes of School Children," in which
countless thousands of parents are directly concerned. "I
take it," said Governor Pardee, speaking as a Governor, a
Â¦physician and a citizen, interested in all three capacities in
the public schools and the children attending them, "that
your duty toward these children is not discharged when you
listen to their recitations, mark their examination papers
and send home their report cards for the signature of their
parents. It is necessary in my- judgment that you exercise
due care not only in the making of sound minds but also
sound bodies."
What followed was a feeling plea for the children. "Many
a child," said Governor Pardee, "who cannot properly see
the blackboards, who cannot plainly see the print in the
books, whose efforts at seeing may be painful, gives up the
unequal struggle and quietly accepts the verdict of 'stupid'
rendered against him by those who come in contact with
him. Others rebel against the unjust charges and become
school Ishmaelites. So, I say, the question- of your chil
dren's eyes is a* most important matter. Upon it frequently
hangs the future success or w;ant thereof of children in our
schools."
This eminently practical topic, which was dealt with at
considerable length, attracted and held the attention of the
educators assembled. As the teachers represented only one
section of the State and the subject is one of universal ap
plication and equally engrossing to all educators and to all
parents who have children in the public schools some addi
tional points from the address are selected for their im
portance for publication here.
Governor Pardee said children often go into the lower
grades of the schools with perfect eyes and normal vision
and in- a year or two their eyes begin to trouble them. They
have headaches and eye pains and cannot see well and begin
to drop behind in their school work. In other words,, while
their eyes were congenitally perfect they have acquired eye
trouble. Putting glasses on children was declared not to be
a fad but a necessity. "They are as much a necessity to the
children's eyes as are crutches to broken legs."
No child, said the Governor, should be permitted to sit
doubled up at a desk holding a book not more than six
inches from his eyes. To hold the book nearer than four
teen,, sixteen or eighteen inches from the eyes is* an ocular
crime. "I come here to-day," said he, "to preach to you in
the interest of the children the gospel of sit up straight." He
went on to say:
"To* aid your little people in .acquiring the proper reading
distance habit see to it that the smaller children are not
seated at the larger and higher desks and be equally careful
that the larger children are not seated at the smaller and
lower desks. Either misfit of child to desk is a â¢scholastic
abomination and should not be allowed. I know of no more
unhygienic practice than that of having school children seated
according to their individual rank in their studies, their po
sitions in the schoolroom changing as they ascend or descend
on" the roll of honor. Rank in school should not determine
the desks that scholars should occupy. Length of leg and
height of body, should always determine that. And any
scholar compelled to sit either with his" knees doubled up
under his chin or his feet dangling in the air or his desk
under his chin or beyond; his easy reach has or ought to
have'the privilege of visiting an equal torture upon his un
observing teacher." .*/: .;,-..

PoiL'cr of Sand Dunes. â j
BT GEORGE FREDERICK WRIGHT. A. M..
LL. D.
â¢ Author of 'Th* Ice Aze in Xorth America,
"Man and the Glacial Period." etc.)
<Cop>right, 1908. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
Those who live in the well-watered
portions of the world, where rich vege
tation covers the surface and protects,
it from the denuding force of the wind,
ran have little realizing sense of the
effectiveness of this ever-active geo
: gical agency. Yet even in some well
watered regions dunes are familiar
phenomena. Dunes are simply "drifts"
Â»>f sand, closely resembling the snow
drifts of winter, and protection against
them is secured by similar means. As
in snowy regions one sees long lines of
close board fences some distance from
the windward side of the railroad to
stop the drifting enow on its
onward career, so he may in
many places see windbreaks to
ftop the drifting sand. But in many
i&ses where a windbreak Is not suf
ficient a constant force of workmen Is
necessary to remove the Band from the
track at stated intervals or after every
unusually severe storm. At such places
the railroad companies, . to their sor
row, learn the enormous power of this
constantly acting geological force in
transferring finely comminuted earthy
mate'rial.froro one place to another.
One of the best known "ocalities for
observing dunes is found on the South
eastern shore of Lake -Michigan. Near
ly all. if not all, .the . railroads ap
proaching Chicago from the east pass
through this series of dunes as they
come around the southern end of the
lake-. Many of the dunes are .very
fresh, with no covering of vegetation,
and rise, like enowdrifts, fifty feet or
more above the general level'. Others
are of euch age that they have been
covered more or less with vegetation,
trees of considerable Bize feeing found
upon them. But in all cases the ac
tion of the wind, in moving the sfcnd
southward from the lake, is evident.
The wind blowing from the north keeps
an exposure of bare sand upon that
*ide and drifts it over into exposures
at equally bare sand upcm the outer
margin. The -width of this belt of
dunes around -the .south end of Lake
Michigan averages a little more than
one mile. The material, being clean
washed sand.- is unfit- for agricultural
purposes, and the area is occupied by
very few houses, and those mostly be
longing to railway employes.
The source of the material of which
>hese dunes are composed and the rate
cf it-Â» movement are Subjects of great
interest. ' r he sand is derived, in the
f:rst place, from the shores of the lake
farther reith, which are constantly be
ir.s eaten into by the waves and cur
t* r.ts. All* along the western shore,
from Evanston to Racine, the waves
&Â»e wearing away the shore at an av
erage rate of three or four feet per an
ram. The material that falls into the
l^kes from the bluffs thus eroded is
worked over by the waves until thÂ«
very finest particles are washed out
ai:c! floated into deep water, while thÂ»
t r,d remains near the shore and is
gradually, washed southward by the
prevailing currents. Every one in
i'hicago knows how land Is forming on
the shore, giving rise to legal contests
us to ownership. From observations of
the United States engineers i.t was
found that 129,000 cubic yards of sand
tvere annually stopped by the two piers
Â¦which -were extended out into the lake
to deep water. This vast amount rep
resented, however, but a fraction of the
v.hole amount of sand that was being
carried by the currents past Chicago
to the south end of the lake.
On reaching the south end of the lake
the sand Is washed up by the waves
during etorms and left for a. consid
erable portion of the year exposed to
the action 'of the winds, which have
drifted it out Into the belt of dunes,
with which so large a portion of the
traveling public is familiar. But owing
to the fact that the prevailing winds cf
this region are westerly the largest
accumulation of dunes Is found upon
the east shore, in Michigan. Travelers
upon the Michigan Central Railroad
cannot fail to have noticed these great
drifts of eand, nearly 1M feet high, at
Michigan City. This belt of dunes,
about a quarter of a mllfwide, rising
sometimes to more than 100 feet in
height, extends northward ajl along the
shore, being specially prominent at St.
Joseph and Grand Haven. In many
places they threaten to overwhelrn
Tvhole villages and to compel the rail
roads to remove their tracks to get out
of the way of the drifting material,
while In some cases houses and forests
have been burled out of sight.
It has been profltable # to dwell thus
fully upon the dunes around the south
cistern portion of Lake Michigan, not
because they are th* largest or the
most conspicuons in the world, but be
cause they are the most accessible and
the best known to the people of the
United States. In some respects a Btill
more Interesting belt of dunes occurs
In Western Nebraska, stretching nearly
across the northern part of the State,
approximately parallel with the course
of the North Platte River, but at a
Distance of many mile? "from it. This
consists of a belt of sand hills a half -

THE- entire scope of the frauds', corruption, mistakes
and maladministration in the Postoffice Department
is now before 'the country in Mr. BristowV report and
in President Roosevelt's vigorous and clear epitome.- The
evidence shows that these criminal indirections began under
the second administration of Mr. Cleveland and have con
tinued under three ensuing administrations and under three
different. Postmasters General, of whose personal integrity
there is no room to doubt.
One gratifying sidelight thrown on the affair is the de
veloped fact that Congressman Loud^ chairman of the
Postoffice Committee of the House, instigated and advised
this investigation,. and procured an appropriation of; money
for that purpose. He, like any public man, may have had
those under him who traded on their contact,. but there is
every evidence that he had reason to believe that the de
partment was being misused to despoil the Government,
and, acting upon that belief, set in motion the inquiry
which has probed the matter to the bottom.
In a matter that reaches so far, and involves the rela
tions of so many officials "and so many private individuals,
it is only natural that many may seem to have, had guilty
knowledge and criminal relations with the heads of the
scheme who are innocent ai wrongdoing. Their connec
tion,* while innoceiTt; may be a misfortune, though their
reputations are subject to,, vindication as the cases pro
ceed.
In its large outline the case is one in which the Gov
ernment, outside of its proper political functions, is engaged
in a vast business, making necessary immense contracts for
transportation and for supplies of merchandise of many
kinds. The annual expenditures in carrying on thi$ busi
ness amount to nearly one hundred millions. The persons
employed in it number about one hundred and thirty thou
sand.* It is not so managed as to support itself. Its expen-,
ditures per capita" of our population amount to $i" 36; its.
'income is only $1 20 per capita per annum. The defi
cit, has to be made good by annual appropriations from
If it were run as a private business it would be wholly
supported by the revenue derived from those who patronize
it. But as -long as the facility exists for -charging off its
deficits to the general taxpayers the annual deficit will ap
pear.. It is an example of' the opportunities afforded by
the Government being in business. Members of Congress
seek popularity by cheapening the postal service to those
who " use it. So we have a progressive cheapening of
stamps, and cost per pound in the express business done
by mail, in the commission on money orders and in the
carrying of second class matter for the benefit of the
patrons o\ the business, while there is not a corresponding
reduction in the expense of running it. All deficits go
into the postal deficiency appropriation and are footed by
the taxpayers.
We have here a situation which invites corruption, and
since the early history of\thc department the invitation has
been accepted, under all parties and all administrations.
The present condition the department, as disclosed by
Bristow's report, is simply the explosion of operations that
.have been going on for ten or fifteen years. It has seemed
to be impossible for such colossal. business operations to be
efficiently managed arid safeguarded by the Postmaster
General.' He has, as a member of the Cabinet, to share
in the properly political functions of the Government. Mat
ters of patronage engross his time and attention, and the
outline and detail of the vast business of his department
have to be committed to subordinates, who may or may
not be selected for their integrity or fitness. They are so
numerous and their duties so intricate, and their extension
to contacts with the business of the country so far reaching,
that the head of the department cannot hope to â¢, inform
himself of either.
The general auditing system of the treasury, applied to
the political part of the Government's functions, is, as far
as they are concerned, an efficient check, but even this
seems to fail when it deals with the Postoffice Department,
and to fail because it is a business. To illustrate the differ
! ence between business as carried on by a corporation and
by the Government: In the business of the Pullman Car
Company, amounting to millions every year, account is
kept of every cake of soap, every piece of bed clothing,
every towel, comb and hairbrush. The general average of
every car in the use of these supplies is known, and any
aberration is immediately examined. If an increase in use
appear the reason has to be known and the consumption
satisfactorily accounted for.
In the transaction of the postoffice business no such sys
tem appears, so we. have a sudden increase in the use of
a special kind of ink. amounting.to $10,000 a year; in mani
folding supplies of $40,000; in other articles of $3,000,000;
in a mail bag fastener of $130,000; automatic cash registers,
$74,275; and so on through the list of merchandise, great
and small, in which the Government was compelled to
deal in its business, and the system of audit does not seeni
to have noted the aberration from the average, or to have
been capable of finding the^reason for its existence. A pri
vate corporation can trace a cake of soap or a coarse
comb. The Government is incapable of finding a leak of
$3,000,000! Â»
These frauds that are revealed will be punished. ' The
President means what he says. It falls to his lot to correct
abuses that were begun when he was a private citizen and
that had accumulated to their existing volume before he be
came President. Let us hope that out of it will come pun
ishment of the guilty, vindication of the innocent, , and,
what is of equal importance, ah enlightened attempt to in
vest this Government business "with business safeguards.

"It's the boy, I suppose, George," he

"Yes, it's the boy again." said

activity of wind in drifting sani into
regions distant from its original source
of supply. The desert of Sahara, Ara

are covered with such moving drifts,
but most attention has been attracted
to them in the more thickly settled por
tions of Europe, where they have occa
sioned the population an immense
amount of trouble. The coast of Nor
folk in England is fringed with sand
hills fifty or sixty feet in height, where
in more than one instance whole vil
lages and ancient churches have been
buried by the material. In Eccles the
village church in 1839 was almost com
pletely hid by the drifting sand which
enveloped it, while thirty years later
the Fame wind which had buried the
church uncovered it and exposed it to
view uoon the other side of the dune.

The Panama situation continues to hold the stage
among our domestic questions. It is evident that .the
Democratic press of the Southern States will not support
the proposed partisan attack on the President. Journals
in Memphis and other Southern commercial centers re
gard the Panama revolution as offering to thb country an
opportunity of which statesmanship should take, advantage,
and do not indorse the narrow partisan view that.it must
be neglected or seizing it denounced because the national
administration is Republican. These papers 'warn Southern

The Tacoma sailed this . evening;;" for
San Francisco, where she will be* pre
pared to go into -commission. . :
I The Tacamo I is ' the' sfxth vessel of
her -class constructed for the United
States Navy, and she. is the first, ; it : .is
â¢said, ! to meet contract requirements,
the Cleveland -and the -Denver both
having failed to develop the. necessary
speed. '.- : _. .- â¢ .
The Tacoma left 'the harbor- early
this morning for Moore's Landing,
from which point tho start was made
about 8:30 o'clock. The wind was blow
ing briskly from the southwest and a
heavy swell was running landward.
The tide was exceptionally high dur
ing last night. On the wWole, how
ever, the conditions were favorable.
The machinery of the new cruiser,
worked smoothly and nothing occurred
to mar the trial. At the conclusion
of the, run over the course of sixty- four
knots it was the unanimous opinion of
the members of 'the trial board and. the
Inspectors that the Tacoma had proved
herself a splendid boat, equal, to . the
Government requirements in every re
spect. The Government contract, called
for "a sustained average* of 16}i-" knots
an hour for four hQurs.- On the" show
ing. .of the . figures . given, out she'ex
ceeded these figures by ten-fiundredths
of. a knot,' and ihis may ..'be . Increased
wjien -.tide deductions are .made.
The course extended from a point op
â¢posite Moore's Landing, about eight
mlfes north of Santa Barbara, to
Point Conception, the distance being
thirty-two knots and 'return. The trial
board consisted of Admiral W. H.
Whiting, Captain J. F. Moser, Com
mander A. F. !Dlxon, A. H. Small,
Lieutenants C. M. Stone, U. T. Holmes
and Assistant Naval Constructor L. S.
Adams.
SANTA BARBARA, Nov. 30.â The
official trial trip of the protected
cruiser Tacoma, wfiich was built at the
Union Iron Works. San Francisco,
took place in Santa 'Barbara channel
to-day under favorable conditions. The
average speed made during the- trip
was 16.60 knots an hour, and it is be
lieved by the navigating officer that
when tide corrections are made a still
better showing will result, as there was
a heavy sea during the run dp the
coast.

j find their places at the table. Red en
velopes decorated with miniatures held
clever verses applying to ( the peculiar
ities of each guest and 'causing no end
â¢of merriment. Hidden -within a pipe
was a r.e<iuest for. a speech or original
toast and the guests were as -generous
as funny in their responses. The
favors were- children's toys applying
â¢to the individual needs of each guest.
â¢The music- was excellent and after dih r
ner dancing and a gave of five-handed
euchre with prizes were enjoyed.

the sea about the vessel; became churned

the action of the .waves that the men had

CHICAGO, Nov. 30.â The Tribune to
day says: Nineteen lives were lost on
the football field during the season of
1903. One boy was driven insane from
injuries. Thirteen players were se
verely injured, some of them being dis
abled for life. The number of minor
but painful accidents goes into the
hundreds and the list of the severely
injured necessarily also is -incomplete.
The feature of the year's tabulation
is that.it shows serious casualties prac
tically were confined to untrained play
ers. No member of any of the first
class elevens was killed or permanently
disabled. One "Yale player and 6ne
Harvard player suffered a broken leg.
No player in any of the teams of the
"big nine" in the West was- the victim
pf any hurt worse than a wrenched
shoulderr a bruised head, a sprained
knee or a turned ankle.
In consequence of the injuries sus
tained by their players several of the
minor schools have forbidden the game
of â¢ football. Two townsâ Columbus
Junction, Pa., and Greenfield, Ohlo-^
have stopped the sport as the result of
petitions circulated' by .parents.

This last game would prove extreme

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 30.
âTreasurer Cowtien of the Associated

football games with the Startford varsi
ty eleven almost every day. â¢
Among the late challenges for games
with the cardinal team three came from
Columbia University, the Carlisle In
dians and Bucknell College. All threa
'of these teams are anxious to com*
West and meet Stanford on almost any
terms and at any place where the
games can be arranged.
The latest proposal comes from tha
Pasadena Tournament of Roses Asso

Stanford and California, to be played
in Pasadena on New Year's day during

â¢ NOTES vF THE TRACK.
Â¦Only the* strong finish of D. Hall got
Meehanus across the line first fop the
mile and a sixteenth selling event. The
Doss entry closed a* 13 to 5 favorlt^,
and, ia a fierce drive, downed the 10 to
1 shot, Billy. Moore, a neck. Chub" ran
third. El Oriente cut out the running
for nearly a mile and then fell back,
beaten.
Walter Jennings' strapping ' colt,
Arabo, had his measure taken by Honi
ton- in the seven-furlong run for three
year-olds. It was the filly's first ap
pearance this season, and, as the route
besides was figured too far for her,
Arabo went to the post a 9 to 10 chance.
There Is a possibility that Jack Mar
ttn took matters a trifle too easy -the
first part of it with the favorite, but
at any rate Honiton led from the start,
'and, handriddeo, finished more than
-a length in advance of the -big fellow
in";*l:"26%. Geheimnes's 'was a good
third:
Foley captured the two-year-old five
furlong dash with F. E. Shaw, a 5 to 1
chance. Ananias, from Johnny. Schorr's
stable and a mild favorite, made all
the iunning, finally losing by half a
length "in a driving finish: Eugenia B
led Dr. KowelJ's Harbor out for thjrd
place.
Elissful, with Willie Haack in the
saddle, gave th.e- favorite, "Bay Wonder,
quite an argument in the six and a
half furlong run following. The first
choice was not lacking in speed, but
ran out .on the stretch turn and lost so
much grpund that he only beat 5 the filly
Ihree-quarters of a length at the .wire.
Quatre finished at their heels, third.
Thisbe, backed .from 10 to 4%, was
cut loose for a good thing in the open
ing event and finished second to Bar
ney Schreiber's Buccleitfh. the 5 to 2
favorite. It could be called a lucky
win, for had Jed Lewis, who rode
Thisbe, not lost so much ground turn-
Ing into the- stretch the mare would
have scored. The show fell to Velma
Clark. ;^-U
Twenty-one " pale, wan and dejected
looking: little bookmakers returned to
this city last evening from Oakland
track. They were, meek, mild-man
nered men, looking not at all like gam
blers. There was a reason though for
all their seeming-disinterestedness.
On Saturday last the ring must have
cleaned up nearly $50,000 and the lay
ers were prepared to gather some more
yesterday. But the betting brigade
came back strongly reinforced and ad
ministered a crushing: defeat to the
pencilers. These retaliatory measures
rjot only cost the ring all.it had won
on Saturday, but more ln addition.
Buccleuth, Bay Wonder and Mee
hanus were the only three successful
favorites,, but, unfortunately for the
bookmakers, F. E.' Shaw, Honiton and
Proper were all well supported. So too
were a number of horses which finished
second and third at comfortable odds..
The defeat of Beau Ormonde by
Proper in the concluding mile purse
run was unexpected but not surprising.
The Ormonde horse was heavily backed
at 6 to 5, while the Jennings entry had
quite as large a train of admirers at
a point higher. Adkins had the mount
on the favorite and was. in front for
nearly seven-eighths of the distance.
Jack Martin astride Proper cut the
stretch turn closely, and when he put
in his challenge Beau Ormonde weak-'
ened and was beaten half a length in
1:40%. Green Morris' big gelding Du
pont ran a close tMird at odds of "20 to 1.

. Signs of Polluted Blood.. /
There is nothing' so repulsive looking and disgogtink as an old sore
You worry over it till the brain grows weary and work* with if until the
patience is exhausted, and the very sight of the old festering, sickly looking
place makes-you irritable, desponden> and desperate. ' â¢ Â°
A chronic sore is the very best evidence that your blood is in an unhealthy
and impoverished condition, that your constitution is breaking down under
the effects of some serious disorder. â¢ The taking of strong medicines, like
mercury or potash, will sometimes so pollute and vitfate the blood and im-
pair the general system that the merest scratch or bruise results in obstinate
â¢ non-healing sores of the most often sir* character.
Often an inherited tain tbreaks out in frightful eating sores upon the limbs
or face in old age or middle life.. Whenever a sore fef uses to heal the blood
is always at fault, and, while* antiseptic wasBes, salves, soaps and powders
can do much to keep dovfn the inflammation and cleanse the* sore it will
never heal permanently till the blood itself has been purified and the deadly
germs and poisons destroyed, and with S. S. S. this can be accomplishedâ the
A**S VdS /^"N pointed blood i* purified and invigorated, and when

and at-the same time tooes up the system and builds-up the general health.

This talk- was followed by another
one before General Manager
Kruttschnitt -left-for- Salt Lake to join
his chief on an inspection of .the" Lucin
cut-off. Yesterday ' Brock and Krutt
schnitt had another conference,, which
resulted in , an .assurance * that the
Southern .Company wduld al<l
liberally in the furtherance of the plans
for the new railroad. Sv . .
"While the Southern Pacific' Company
Â¦will not build the^road !t has agreed to
financially .aid Its 'promoters, and in the
preliminary work it will lend-its-'sur
veyors and the necessary rolling stock
for the grading and construction "work.
Incidentally of course the agents of
President Harriman have carefully,
bound the Brock .syndicate with an
agreement that will prevent" the* new
road ever falling into the hands of in
terests that are inimical to. those of the
Harriman lines. Â¦ â¢ Â¦* . .
The road is practically the salvation
of. the Tonopah mining district in- that
It gives it a ready outlet for ores of the
various rich properties and insures
cheaper transportation for necessary
operating material. . . . 4 * ;.V
A company was incorporated to build
the line, which -will be about, sixty-two
miles long, but for reasons which the
promoters have never explained their
plans . neyec matured beyond a rpugh
survey of the route. For some time
Brock and his business associates were
negotiating with the Southern* Pacific
Company with a view of having E. H.
Harriman Join withthem In'the con
struction work, but they were informed
By General Manager Kruttschnitt that
Harriman was. top busy with the work
of/completion of the Lucin cut-<Â»ff. and
other improvements along the* Harri
man system to give attention to the
Tonopah project. '^ : , H> ;
* Recently It vas reported that out
side capital had agreed to build the
road and this news 'apparently stkred
the interest of President *Harriman, for
it was not long before* the Brock syn
dicate people were given "the hint that
| it would be worth their while to have
another talk with General Manager
Kruttschnitt,- an opportunity which
John Brock was quick to avail hjmself

The Iong-talked-of railroad from the
Tonopah mining" district to a point
known as Rhodes Marsh, six miles be
low Sodavflle, Nev., will soon be. built.
E. H. Harriman* through his general
manager, Julius Kruttsctenitt, yester
day informed John Brock of Philadel
phia, president of the Tonopah Mining
Company, .which is deeply concerned In
the project, that the assistance of the
Southern Pacific . Company will be
given. to the enterprise. .
Brock and John Hays Hammond,
consulting engineer of the Tonopah
Mining Company, have been at* the. Pal-*
ace Hotel . for several days, anxiously
awaiting the decision of the railroad
company, and when It was given to
them yesterday Brock hurriedly packed
his trunk and departed for the East
on the evening train. The enterprise,
behind j which are Brock and other
Philadelphia capitalists associated with
him in the Tonopah Minihg*Company,
originally called for a line from "Tono
pah to Sodaville, but the* terminus at
the latter end was finally, changed to
Rhodes Marsh. /
HABRIMAN IS INTEBESTED.
A forfeiture of any of these condi
tions is supposed to be followed by a
revocation of the permit by the Boar<J
of; Harbor Commissioners to sell per
ishable products, on the wharves of the
State In this city* It will be noticed
that In the quoted foregoing language
the conditions appear to be made ap
plicable to prevent discrimination in
selling and buying, "whether the trans
actions take place on the wharves of
the State at any other place. This
raises an Interesting question as- to the
extent of the jurisdiction of the Board
of Harbor Commissioners, which may
be treated by the attorneys who are ex
pected to J .j.-';
An interesting- feature of the hearing
may tte-a discussion by attorneys con
cerning the real meaning of the Wood
ward law. . In the opening paragraph it
deals -.with discrimination ; upon the
wharves or other, property of the State
in the city and county of Sa,h Fran
cisco. In the -form of aoDlication for
a permit that is'coritained in the law,
the.- ftr'lo wine words are included:
"I (or we) agree that I (or we) will
not during the life of such permit be
a party to any conspiracy, agreement
or understanding whereby* I (or we)
ehall refuse to sell any solvent pur
chaser or to buy from any person what
soever; and I (or we) will sell
impartially and at the same prices to
all who desire to purchase for cash,
without regard.to their business or In
tended disposition of the products, and
will exercise no discrimination what
ever bet-.veen buyers and sellers by rea
son of their occupation^ affiliation or
non-affiliation."
Mr. F<jy said that he did not know
ho the retailer is that is to- appear
beforeiihe board. It was eis.ewhere said
â¢that t,he person is A. Fundas. who does
busings, oh Third street. No complaint
has been filed by him.
.Secreviry Foy of the Board of Har

He Is now . at the Palace Hotel, having
Just returned from the north, where a
deal was effected last week with George
Mason, former president of the railroad
company, whereby the latter's interest in
the. corporation was transferred to Lind
ley. The transfer of stook was followed
by a meeting of the directors of the Kla
math Railroad Company, who received
the resignation of Mason as president and
elected Lindley in his s.tead.
The company Is now operating thirty
miles of road between the points men
tioned above, but the plan is to extend
the line over Klamath Lake, a- distance
of thirty-two miles; President . Lindley
stated yesterday that the "route the
new extension Is to rjin has already been

inaugurated t early' during the coming
year. He has been negotiating for the

The spectators in Police Judge Fritz's
cour.tâ and there was a big crowd of
themâ thought for a moment that they
w'ere to be treated to a display of fistic
exercise as the. outcome of a sharp
oral tilt between Attorney Alford and
Assistant District Attorney Harris.
And only the prompt intervention of
the court and the alacrity of the bail
iffs prevented the looked for combat.
It was during the preliminary exam
ination of former Policeman Joseph
Feld, charged with having fatally shot
his father-in-law at the latter's resi
dence,.and the aged widow of the slain
man was Under a sharp cross-examin
ation by Alford when the war-cloud
suddenly appeared. The attorney had
asked the witness if she saw. the de
fendant strike her husband more than
one blow, and she had evasively
answered the question, when Harris
jumped to his feet and accused Alford
of deliberately trying to confuse the
woman. Alford denied the accusation,
and said Harris* conduct was uncalled
for and outrageous.
"You lie!" promptly and warmly re
torted Harris. \
For a moment Alford glared in sur-
Mrs. Bean confined her vocal 1 ;
to moaning and crooning until Mrs.
Herman, called for the prosecution, in
dorsed Mrs. Curtis' charge of intem
perance, and then again did the defend
ant's voice pierce the empyrean in
wordless protest. Again did all those
present muffle their ears, and once more
did Bailiff Mahony valiantly brave the
music and subdue the musician.
"If you do that again,',' said the court,
addressing Mary, "I'll â well, I. don't
know how loryj I'll send you up for."
But there was no further bidding for
judicial reproof by Mrs. Bean. After
the evidence was all in her case" was
continued two weeks, with the distinct
understanding that if, she fails to com
port herself with ladylike dignity dur
ing the Inteflm she will be haled' Intc
c-vurt an4 hastened to }all before she
has time to shriek a defense.
Mrs. Mary Bean, aged 69, was the
producer of. the vocal*. Innovation:. It
was Inspired by certain statements not
complimentary to her character made
on the witness stand- -by* Mrs." Agnes
Curtis and corroborated by' Mrs. .Her
man. The three ladles are neighbors
on Hoff avenue, -and' Mrs. Cur
tis had Mrs. Bean arrested* on
a charge of disturbing the peace of the
.avenue's residents as a whole and her
own rest in particular. She testified
that Mrs*. Bean was in the habit of
tippling- strong waters until her reason
fled and thstt "wheji thus unburdened
Â¦by cbm-mon ; sense she had a penchant
for. "seeking "the complaining witness
and iriaking-.her a target .for fiercely
â¢deli.ye.re4 fusillades of verba.1 abuse, it
was further : adduced: by Mis.. V Curtis

.:T.heV?harge: of inebriety evoked the
first, screech 'from Mrs. Bean. It came
like the proverbial ;; bolt from a clear
?ky and its sharp - crescendo involun
tarily drew its hearers tq their feet
with hand3 to ears. : .
"Stop her!" shouted the court:
A bailiff sprang to Mary's side *an<l
tried to quell the tympanum splitting
yell, but the best he could do was to
reduce it to prolonged diminuendo -that
finally lapsed in an agonizing wail.
When^ silence was restored the "court
mopped his brow, stared reprovingly at
the offending Mrs. Uean and. sternly
commanded her not to do lit again, elr.e
she would be visited .with severe.penal
ties, 'â¢"â¢'j

Police Judge Mogan's endeavor to ad
just a neighborhood ruarrel, involving
several matrons, was interrupted at ir
regular intervals yesterday morning by
a feminine ho'wl that shrilled through
every nook and cranny of. the Hall of
Justice and even penetrated the calm
precincts of the Coroner's quarters
across the alley.. It was a mezzo fal
setto screech of pitch and'durati'on that
Patti might envy and its tone was *a
mixture of anger and resentment. Ex
perts in operatic vocalism opined that
nothing like it ever wafted
from the Tivoli stage, and persons with
little or no # appreciation of musical nov
elty profanely compared it to the shriek
that emanates from an.ungreased wag
on axje bearing a heavy load up a steep
hill. â¢ . .

For attempting to plunder the p\)or
box of Â§t. Francis Church, at "Mont
gomery avenue and "Vallejo street,
Louis Marmont was sentenced ttf'the
limit, six months' imprisonment, â¢ by
Judge Fritz. Marmont is 62 years of
age. He was caught in the act of
pilfering the contents of the box by
Father Caraher. When arrested he ve
hemently denied the charge made by
the priest, but In court he owned up.
that he was guilty^ ;. * ; >
For a while yesterday morning the
appearance of Police Judge. Mogan's
Â¦tribunal was strongly suggestive of \
scene from "The Romany Rye" or the
great third act of "Carmen." Swart
gypsy men and women jostled each
other In courtroom and corridor, and
the picturesqueness of their cos
turnery, the. queer patois in which they
chattered and the expressiveness* of
their gesticulations contributed novel
effect to an ' environment in which
strange sights and sounds are .not rare.
â¢The gaudily attired women and side
whiskered men. were there to see what
would become of Annie J. Mitchell and
Katherine Domingo, charged by Frank
Mitchell of the same tribe with rob
bing him of a railroad ticket for which
he had paid $15/ Mitchell testified that
he. had desired to go -to Kansas City
and borrowed from nis motherâ who
seems to be the Azucena of the camp
on tne San Br^ino roadâ the money
with which to procure the means of
transportation. When,, he. returned to
the camD the ticket was in his coat
pocket, and by some meansâ he could
not tell exactly howâ the two. defend
ants abstracted it. When he missed
the pasteboard he openly and vigorous
ly accused the women of having^ pil
fered it, and .the" accusation led" to de
nial and finally developed a faction
fight, in which the* entire tribe was par
ticipating when three -mounted police
men swooped down upon the scene of
strife and gathered in the three prin
cipals.
With a saucy swish of her Carmen
esque skirts, Annie^J. Mitchell took the
witness stand and denied point blank
the charge filed against her and Kath
erine Domingo by Mitchell. What really
angered the. man, she stated, was her
refusal to lend him her horse and
buggy to haul hie "traps" to the ferry.
After surveying the competing wit
nesses .and apparently relinquishing his
effort to ascertain which of them had
come nearest to telling ' the truth,
Judge Mogan dismissed the case.
"The courtJsbf the opinion," was his
final order, "that afc five attorneys .are
engaged, in this case the defendants
have been sufBcie'ntly punished."
Then there was a cpneerted babel of
harsh gutturals from the side-whisker
ed men and a chorus of shrill com
ments from the hooded * women, and
the curtain fell to rise next moment
upon a playlet in which the characters
neither looked nor acted out of the or-
Subsequently both- attorneys apolo
#iÂ£ed to the court for their unusual be-'
havior.and the incident closed. The
examination of Feld was continued till
Wednesday,
In a moment two stalwart forms
were between the angry lawyers and
the danger of collision, was averted.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Ventura arrived yesterday, twen
ty-one days fourteen hours from Syd
ney ar.d five days sixteen hours from
Honolulu. She- arrived strictly on
schedule time and in spite of a strong
ebb tide and numerous obstacles in
the way Captain Hayward docked the
liner in style that won a smile of ap
proval from Captain H. Q. Howard, the
steamship company's superintendent.
It* was one of the prettiest dockings
made along the water front for many
days and that under conditions which
would have tempted many mariners to
rest at anchor until the tide took" a rest.

Diseases of Women Cured.
HORE PROOF:
"In five weeks* treatment Electro-
chemistry cured me perfectly of a se-
vere rheumatism, which caused a
swelling of the ankle joints and a
stiffness and lameness in my knees.
The pains were very severe at times,
and there was a great weakness in my
back. My general health was greatly
run down, and besides curing my
rheumatism;, strengthening my back
and relieving me of my pains, the Elcc-
tro-Chemic treatment has built me up
m every manner."

Sugar â Raw, steady. Refined quiet. The market
for coffee futures opened firm at an advance of
10 to 15 points and ruled very active during the
entire session, the business coming out at the
largest total for the season. The activity and
strength had no special explanation, being due
apparently to the increased confidence of the
bullish interests now operating in the market
as a result of the firmness in primary markets,
continued lig-ht primary receipts and further
. reports of unsatisfactory crop conditions. The
m?rket closed firm, net 15" to" 25 points higher.

about 20,000 .cotton textile operatives
were reduced to-day. To-day's'addi
tion brings the total number in New

fall to about 64,000, and the cut that
takes. effect in New Bedford next Mon-"
day ~ will swell this number to about
75,000 and complete, a general reduction
in Southern. New England cotton mills.
The cut averages 10 per cent. _ .
Â¦ To-day practically every cotton mill â¢
in Rhode 'Island", where there' are about
2.200,000 spindled, adopted 'the scale. In
that State" nearly 20.000 operatives are
affected and ,the new order of thlngai
will mean a loss of fully $20,000 weekly
in wages. The cut also became opera
tive in mills in Massachusetts and Con

"It is my intention," said Mayor
Schmitz, after the meeting,' "to have a
friendly suit instituted by some tax
payer yet to be selected to j-estrain the
Board of Supervisors from taking any
action looking to the Issuance of the

"That was a month ago," replied the
Mayor, "and" nothing has been done

Immediate action, as I am having pre
pared the necessary papers -for the
bringing of proceedings to have a de-,
cision on the legality of the bonds, in
order that their sale may .be consum
mated at an early date."
"In .the expectation that there will
be a derriand for the bonds," said the
Mayor, "I feel that something should
be done to hasten their issuance."
Braunhart produced a copy of a reso
lution asking, the City Attorney to
bring the bond issue before the Su
preme Court to determine its validity
and thought no further action should
be taken until the City Attorney had
been heard from. . â¢ . -
Mayor Schmitz explained that he did
not desire to reflect on the board by
suggesting that action be taken, but he
thought the matter should be hurried
a little.
Owing to the probability, that prospective pur
chasers will require a. judicial determination of
the validity of the bonds to be issued some
delay will in any event intervene, and It would
ssem the part of wisdom, as- well as of duty,
to proceed at once with the preliminaries neces
sary to the issue thereof in order that their
proceeds may within some reasonable period
become available for the purposes to which
they are to be devoted. I respectfully suggest
that we assume all proceedings thus far had to
be valid and order the Immediate Issue of the
bonds. . . j
URGES IMMEDIATE ISSUE.
Mayor Schmitz sent a communication
yesterday to the Board of Supervisors
In which he urged the immediate is
suance bf the bonds for public improve
ments, for which the_ people voted at
an election last September. The Mayor
wishes their legality established by the
courts as soon as possible. The com
munication follows:
Gentlemen â The people of this city having
recently decided by an overwhelming vote In
favor of a bond Issue for various important

referred to the Health Committee a
proposed ordinance appropriating an
additional sum of $2000 out of the
'urgent necessity fund to prosecute the
work of cleaning the Chinatown dis
trict. Action was taken on motion of
Supervisor d'Ancona, who held that
the Board of -Health should present a
detailed statement .of its expenditures
for cleaning Chinatown before any fur
ther sums were appropriated for the
purpose.
Secretary Emery of the Health Board
said that the additional appropriation
was absolutely necessary.
Mayor Schmltz asked Emery if he
had not said when the last $5000 was
appropriated for the purpose that it
would suffice to complete the work of
cleaning Chinatown. Emery said he
had. but the additional money was
necessary to tear down unsanitary
buildings and because the district to
be cleansed had been extended by the
Federal officials.
