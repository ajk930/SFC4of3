According to advices received by the
Nippon Mara, which arrived from the
Orient yesterday, changes of great sig
nificance are taking place in the army
and navy of the Mikado. The informa
tion is to the effect that the. Japanese
Government is quietly dispensing with
the services of foreigners who have for
a number of years been attached to the
army and navy as Instructors.
It is asserted by some that fear pre
vails among the heads of the Japanese
army and navy that these foreign in
structors might be partial to Russia
and in the event of war between the
two countries betray the secrets of the
Japanese army and navy, but those
who are familiar with the affairs of the
army and navy of the Mikado know
that no foreigner is ever allowed to
hold ; a , position , in the Japanese army
or ' navy^ in time of ; war. Therefore 'the

TIENTSIN, Dec. 20. â The reason
for the degradation of Chang Yi. di
rector of the Northern Railway, and
the taking from him of all his honor?,
as cabled yesterday, Is that in 1900 he
sold the valuable mines at Kalping.
Chang Vi has been given two months'
grace during which he is expected to
again bring the mines under Chinese
control. Should he fail to do this
further punishment awaits him.

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 20.â As a result
of a cuarrel over a dice game in the
"red light" district this morning: an un
known negro, said to be a Porto Rican,
fired a shot at a negro barkeeper named
. George Wilkinson at a range of less
than ten feet and missed him.
Patrolmen Roller and Whalling saw
the shootingâ ln fact, were within less
than 100 feet of the place. When they
started after the unknown negro there
began a pistol duel with him. which
only poor marksmanship prevented
from resulting in a tragedy. Instead of
running when he saw the officers, the
r.cgro for a moment stood his ground
and began shooting at them.* He did
rot try to escape until they brought
their revolvers into play and by that
time he had only three shots left in
his sun.
V> halJing would have killed him but
for the failure of a cartridge to explode.
The officer's gun fouled and before he
could make it work again the negro
was out of his reach and was reloading
his gun. Roller chased him into China
town, and as he disappeared up a dark
hallway he turned and fired a parting
shot which struck the sidewalk, glanced
and struck Whalling in the hand, in
flating a painful wound.
The two officers promptly returned
the fire and a showrr of bullets was
sent into the hallway. Later a search
.vas made there and blood was found
on the stairway, she-wing that the negro
had been wounded. One of the officers
went to the other side of the China
town block to prevent the escape of
the fugitive, while Roller remained
guarding the plajce where he was last
teen. Thinking to summon reinforce
ments Whalling blew his whistle and
Roller, supposing that he had cornered
rhe nVgro. responded to the call. While
he was away the negro ran out and
made his escape.

PEKING. Dec. 20.â While no news
has been received at the Japanese le
gation that Japan has sent an ultima
tum to Russia, it is recognized at the
legation that a grave crisis is ap
proaching. Major General Tamani,
the Japanese military attache, and
the Japanese colonel who has been
instructing General Tuan Shai Kai's
troops, have both started for Japan.
The native press has reiterated a cir
cumstantial story to the effect that,
in the event of Manchuria being re
tained by Russia, it was the inten
tion of Great Britain to establish a
protectorate over the Yang-tse Val
ley as compensation and to appoint
a Viceroy therein, so that her prestige
in the Far East would be equal to
Russia's. Some of the native papers
give Wai Wu Hu, of the Chinese For
eign Board, as authority for the story.
This fiction is largely credited and
gravely discussed, and is creating hos
tility against Great Britain. It is sus
pected that the story has been fos
tered by unfriendly agencies appoint
ed for the purpose, and the British
legation is investigating its origin.

The treaty is in danger. There cart
be no doubt about this. It is gleefully
affirmed by the Democrats and assented
to even by the most outspoken friends
of the administration in the Senate. But
before its defeat can be accomplished
much progress must be made In the di
rection of obtaining Democratic unity.
The minority leaders are bending every
nerve to marshal their entire vote
against the treaty. If they do that they
can prevent ratification at this session
of Congress or amend the treaty in such
a way that it would have to be sent
back to Panama or voted -down in a

*tu\\ YORK. Dec. 20.â The following
advertisement appears in the Herald:
"Information or whereabouts wanted
of William Lancaster, formerly of Pat
erson. N. J., dead or alive, by his moth
er. Mrs. Edward Lancaster, care Nor
ton, 846 Hancock street, Brooklyn.
N. Y."
The advertisement says that, tied up
in the New Jersey courts, is a fortune
of $100,000. which cannot be distributed
until it is determined whether William
Lancaster Is living or dead. With a
mother's faith. Mrs. Edward Lancas
ter is certain that her son is alive, al
though shfc has not seen him in nine
teen years. In the hope that the ad
vertisement would reach his eye. she
inserted it yesterday. ,
Edward Lancaster, father of the
wandering heir, died in January. l^g.
For thirty years he had been connected
with the Cooke Locomotive Works in
Paterson. William, who had a roving
disposition, left home when he was 21
years of age. Six times a year he
wrote, but in 1337 this correspondence
ceased and William was heard from
no more. His last letter came from
San Francisco and said he was doles
well as a civil engineer, which profes
sion he and his brother, Edward, were
skilled In.
When the father lay dying Mrs. Lan
caster telegraphed to Illnols, where Ed
ward was employed, and to William's
last address in San Francisco. Edward
reached Paterson Just as 'his father
died. William neither came nor an
swered.
After his father's death Edward Lan
caster obtained a position in Paterson
and made his home with his mother.
Stricken by heart disease, he died on
December 2 of this year, and Mrs.
Lancaster, left alone, came to Brook
lyn.
Mrs. Lancaster has a dower right in
one-third of the estate left by her hus
band and this would revert to her mis
sing son at her death. Under the New
Jersey law If the son does not appear
within a specified time after his moth
er's death he will be declared legally
dead and the entire property will go to
the brothers and sisters of Edward
Lancaster Sr.
Mrs. Lancaster is 70 years of age.
William, if living, is 40.
quietly getting rid of its. foreign In
structors signifies that Japan is pre
paring for war.
An instance of the Japanese mistrust
of foreigners occurred recently while
the Nippon Maru was preparing for her
homeward trip. Among her passengers
from Shanghai was Lieutenant A. H.
Potter, a well-known young American
cavalry officer, who with his wife, for
merly Miss McNutt of this city, was on
his way from the Philippines to Yoko
hama on a sick leave. He wore civilian
clothes with the exception of the regu
lation campaign hat bearing the in
signia of his branch of the military
service, and his identity was well
known to all on board. Notwithstand
ing this fact the lieutenant and his
wife when they disembarked at Naga
saki with the intention of going over
land to Yokohama by way of Kobe
were placed under the espionage of
Japanese secret agents, who accompa
nied them aboard the train and kept a
close yatch on the officer. Lieutenant
Potter had not proceeded far on his
Journey before he discovered ' that he
and his wife were being closely fol
lowed, and at Kobe he protested
against the action of the Japanese
agents, who only smiled at his annoy
ance and continued on the Journey to
Yokohama with the American couple.
There the lieutenant again com
plained about ,being followed and tried
to convince the government representa
tives that he was an American army
officer in Yokohama on sick leave. Ap
parently his statements were of no
avail, for when the Nippon Maru de
parted from Yokohama the secret
agents were still tracking Potter and
his young wife, who had planned to re
main there several weeks. Their only
consolation was found in the Informa
tion, imparted to them through the me
dium of a prominent American resident
of Yokohama, that the Japanese Gov
ernment was treating all army officers
and other foreign strangers in a similar
manner.

CLEVELAND. Ohio. Dec. 20.â Roscoe
W. Derby, a machinist, despondent
over his financial affairs, killed his wife
and their three children at their home
here early to-day and then committed
suicide. The dead:
ROSCOE W. DERBY, aged 45.
MRS. DELLA S. DERBY.
HAROLD DERBY, aged S.
ALICE DERBY, aged 7.
THOMAS DERBY, aged 5.
The crime was extraordinary in its
thoroughness and evidently had been
planned carefully by Derby.
Derby had been down town as late
as 11 o'clock last night, ostensibly
shopping:, but in all probability procur
ing ammunition for his revolver. When
he arrived home his wife and he talked
for a time with a neighbor about a
Christmas festival they had planned.
WIFE SHOT WHILE ASLEEP.
The crime Is believed to have bÂ«en
committed at about 4 o'clock this
morning. Mrs. Derby was shot to death
in bed, two bullets having been fired
into her forehead and a third, probably
fired after the children had been killed,
penetrating: the back' of the neck. # She
probably was killed i while asleep, the
expression on her face showing no sign
of a struggle.
Two of the children, however, prob
ably had a struggle with their father
after they had been awakened by the
shooting and made an ineffectual at
tempt to escape. Harold's body was
found in a pool of blood in the kitchen
and that of Alice in the dining-room
with her face to the floor and a bullet
In her breast. Harold evidently nad
been pursued through the house by his
father, as the furnishings were iri dis
order. From the location of his wounds
the boy probably was caught by his
father and held while the revolver was
placed against the little fellow's fore
head and two bullets sent into his
brain. There also was evidence of a
struggle on Alice's part.
LOSES MONEY OX RACES.
The last of the children to die was
Thomas, aged 5. He had remained in
bed, probably still asleep when Derby
shot him in the head.
After the crime had been committed
Derby went to the bedroom where his
wife lay dead, and, lying down by her
side, fired a bullet into his own brain.
A number of poolroom race checks
were found about the house, showing
that Derby had been trying his luck
at betting.
The first knowledge of the tragedy
was communicated in a letter written
by Derby yesterday to a friend in this
city. The letter was to the effect that
when it should be received the Derby
family would be dead. When the friend
hurried to the house this morning the
terrible tragedy was revealed.
Apart from the delicate state of
negotiations between the two nations,
Reuter says, it also is known that
Russia is assuming a more defiant at
titude and the outlook may be regard
ed as more gloomy than it hitherto
has been, although it cannot be said
that the resources of diplomacy have
been completely exhausted.
The Daily Mail's Pekin correspond
ent declares that a few Manchu no
bles who are under Russian, influence
are delaying the conclusion of an al
liance between China and Japan.
"All of the positions cannot be de
fined, as not half of them are yet
provided With guns. The Russians
are preparing for the investment of
Port Arthur, but will make, a fight
to secure Dalny from occupation."
Keuter's Telegram Company has
learned that considerable anxiety ex
ists in the best-informed circles of
London regarding the possible out
come of the situation in the Far East.
Fears are expressed that the Russian
Government may have overstepped
the bounds which would make peace
ful negotiations with Japan possible.
It may be regarded as quite certain,
it asserts, that Japan will not accept
the principles of the Russian note,
which are altogether at variance with
Japan's main contentions, and that
Japan's reply must necessarily be
cast, in this sense.
* The correspondent of the Daily
.Telegraph;~Tvh<vÂ«fte**Â«Â£ tour, of Man
churia,'has arrived at Nagasaki, ex
presses the belief that there will be
no warâ certainly not before the
spring â and that Russia does not
want war. before she has consolidated
her position in Manchuria. She is ap
prehensive, however, of the strength
of the Japanese fleet and over the
attitude of China and Great Britain.
The correspondent doubts whether
there are as many as 100,000 troops
south of Moukden or whether the
stores there will last for sjx months.
Electric lights have been installed in
Moukden. The correspondent believes
that Port Arthur is over-fortined and
says:
The special cablegram from the
Far East published in this morning's
newspapers . throws ho light on the
situation, but all . are agreed that
Japan has not sent an ultimatum to
Russia.
LONDON, Dec. 21. â The morning
newspapers display increased alarm
over the aspect of affairs in the Far
Easjt, rather from the fear that some
unforeseen incident may precipitate a
conflict than from any belief that the
resources of diplomacy have become
exhausted, the opinion being still al
most general that both Russia and
Japan are anxious to avoid war.
The Morning Post, which is inspired
in the Japanese interest, makes a sug
gestion which may possess significance
â namely, that Japan should cut the
Gordian knot by declaring a protec
torate over Korea. The paper con
tends that such a solution would com
mend itself to all the powers, with the
exception of Russia, and that it might
even be welcomed in St. Petersburg,
if it be true that Russia does not de
sire war.
Publication of Obituary Notices Results
ill the Prompt Picketing of
Stricken Homes.
CHICAGO. Dec. 20.â Shrinking from
the espionage of strikers' pickets and
fearful that funeral parties -would be
attacked by the striking livery drivers,
many Chicago families have refrained
from publicly announcing their be
reavements. In the vaults of seven un
dertakers' establishments lie the bodies
cf persons about whose death the ut
most secrecy is maintained, and whose
funerals will be postponed until after
the settlement of the strike. In other
cases the stricken relatives have ar
ranged for evening funerals and pri
vate burials, of which no announce
ment is made.
The scenes that attended several fu
nerals held on Saturday, when pickets
attempted to interfere with the re
moval of bodies, have led the Health
Department officials to sanction the se
crecy that is being preserved. The un
dertakers have been informed that, un
less public safety demands it. burials
will xi'ot be insisted upon until such a
Tim-e as funeral parties shall be safe
frc-m molestation.
|' A. A. Perriso. president of the Liv
erymen and Undertakers" Association,
said to-night:
Â¦ The reason more deaths are not be
ing announced is because we have
learned that the strikers have been
reading the list of death notices In the
papers and sending pickets to watch
the houses."
Practically no attempt was made by
funeral parties to-day to reach the
cemeteries and the day was free from
disturbances.

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 20. â Weather

the counties both north and south
of Los Angeles, but in the belt which
includes Los Angeles, Orange, San

conditions can not be said to be very

sections that Bishop Conaty has been
asked to set apart a day of prayer
for rain. This request came from

OUTLOOK IX SACRAMEXTO.
Farmers and Orchardista Have Xo
Complaint About the Weather.
SACRAMENTO. Dec. 20.â The farm
ers and orchardists in the country sur
rounding Sacramento are more than
satisfied with the weather conditions
this season. While the rainfall has
been nearly an inch less than that reg
istered at a corresponding date last
year, the precipitation has come at
times favorable to the farmer, and the
prevalence of damp fogs has aided in
preparing the ground for plowing.
The farmers declare that they will have
a splendid crop of grain, while the fruit
outlook is good, so far as the period of
the year enables the orchardista to
judge.
Ranchers Hasten Operations to Be in
Readiness for Rain.
SAX LUIS OBISPO HOPEFUL.
.SAN LUIS OBISPO. Dec. 20.â San
Luis Obispo County . has j derived very
little benefit from the rainfall so far
this season. There have been two or
three rains, aggregating about .75 of an
Â¦ inch, which has been general over the
county and sufficient to keep down any
serious alarm regarding coming crops.
The dairy and live stock interests have
suffered for the time being, but there
has not ' been a scarcity of water in
wells and springs, as last year's rains
were copious.
The ranchers are hopeful and are
pushing farming operations as fast as
possible under existing conditions. A
third of an inch of rain has fallen gen
erally throughout the county within a
week. Sales of farming lands, which
have been many during the past year,
continue. Several notable farming and
seed-growing enterprises have been
launched within the past few weeks.
VENTURA COUNTY DRY.
Stock Raisers and Fruit Growers Walt
* ' Anxiously for a Storm. â¢ ";
,.. VENTURA, Dec. 20.â Not a drop of
rain has fallen In this county since last
May. Last season to date the rainfall
was over seven inches. The ground is
very dry, and the stockmen arid or
chardists are anxiously waiting for
rain. Many of the stock raisers have
big bunches of cattle scattered about
the ranges and there is little feed. .* ; The
ground is too dry for plowing. Lack of
rain may kill fruit trees. The price of
hay is tending upward. Early In the
season hay was sold at $S per ton, now
it is from $i2 to $14.
The sugar beet farmers have not
planted any yet and will not do so until
the first rain comes. The lima bean
growers are not worrying, especially
those who have their crop on hand. The
price will soon reach three" cents. Many
are holding for this amount.. The
weather is ideal for the harvesting/ of
the large walnut crop. v Rain is wanted
in this section.- Â¦Â¦ [*''â¢?. '*:' "*Â¦. <:<'

MADERA, 'Dec. 20.â Since the last
showers the crop prospects in this
county, which before were dubious, are
looking brighter. The last storm
brought .86 of an inch of rain, which
insures -the early sown grain a good
start. Cattle in the foothills have been
suffering, as there was little feed, but
the outlook is much more encouraging
now. The stockmen are of the opinion
that the showers saved thousands of
cattle from starving to death. The
farmers in the valley are plowing and
planting, and every one is Jubilant and
hopeful of a good year.
Showers Save the Cattle and the
Farmers Are Delighted.
MADERA 18 ,. BRIGHTENING.
FRESNO, Dec. 20.â The rain of
Wednesday last amounted to .88 of an
inch. Since then there has been no
rain. Another downpour Is needed bad
ly, for the rain up to date has been
far behind the average fall of previous
reasons and has been barely Bufflcient
to moisten up the ground for plowing.
However, little damage has been done
so far in the valley, and with late rains
to make up for the deficiency a good
crop can be depended upon. In the
mountains feed for cattle has been very
scarce, and the situation was getting
rather serious when the last rain came,
several .cattlemen asserting that there
was danger of their stock starving. The
rainfall In the mountains was particu
larly heavy and there is no further
cause for worry.
Good Wetting of the Ground Is De
sired for Plowing.

ANTWREP, Dec 20.â Six tugs were
engaged" throughout the day in efforts
to float the Red Star Line steamship
Finland, from this port for New York,
which stranded during thick weather
yesterday, near Flushing. This even
ing the steamshipcommenced to unload
her cargo into tugs. It Is believed she
will come oft when lightered. There
are only a few first-class passengers
aboard.
Tho Finland was steaming at sixteen
knots when she struck. The place
where she is ashore is at the mouth of
Scheldt, nine 'miles from Flushing. Her
position is dangerous. She has 600
steerage passengers aboard.
The fog continues thick. It is hoped
she will be got afloat when the weather
clears. .

COLUSA, Dec. 20.â The prospects for
crops In Colusa County never looked
more favorable at this time of the year
than they do now. The rainfall here
up to date measures 5.55 inches, which
is^.42 of an inch more than at this time
last 'year, and the fall has been dis
tributed just where it would do the
most good. The acreage sown to grain
this year is greater than for several
years, and if the present favorable con
dition continues there is no reason why
Colusa County this season should not
equal her record of 1880, when she pro
duced more grain than any other coun
ty of a like .size in the United States.

Prospect.
11.53 inches last season at this date.
Sonoma County has had two heavy
storms this season, during one of
which seven Inches of rain fell in
three days, and on Tuesday night last
there was a downpour of 2.25 Inches
in twelve hours. Sufficient moisture
has already fallen to Insure splendid
crops, but there will be considerable
more rain In this vicinity before the
winter season ends. Grass Is making
a splendid growth, and is almost large
enough to nurture stock, and in some
places stock has already been turned
out to graze. Early sown grain is
doing splendidly, especially in the vi
cinity of Forestville. Farmers from
that vicinity declare that they have
never seen the grain looking so well
at this season of the year. Trees and
vines are looking well, and give evi
dence of good crops during the com
ing year. The past season was ,one
of the most prosperous of years in
this county, harvests being abundant
and prices excellent. Grapes, which
constitute one of the largest crops of
the county, sold lower than last year,
but in everything else the prices were
satisfactory. Sonoma County people
are among the most prosperous and
contented in the entire State. Crop
failures are absolutely unknown in
this county. i
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON. Dec. 20.â Ths weather
has come Just right for San Joaquin
County this fall. Plowing is now In
full progress, both on the islands and
on the "west side," or foothill country.
The rains were followed by dense Isl
and fogs, which prevented field work
for some time, but clear and cool
weather came last week and gave the
ranchers a chance to get at the ground,
which is in solendid condition.
One of the scenes on the islands Is
the plows hauled by the &reat traction
engines, which have been turning the
nod to the extent of about 600 acre3 a
day. The horse as a motive power on
the big island ranches is much out of
date and half a dozen of the big en
f*1r.es do as much work as a company
of farmers working with the old single
plows and teams.
The rainfall thus far has been a good
average, but the heavy fogs have left
the surface ground quite moist. There
Is now abundant feed and th? country
looks quite rreen. In the northern end
of the county orchard and vineyard
work is well under way. It looks as if
there will be a heavy increase in vine
yard acreage above Lodi. There have
been but two .or three heavy frosts so
far.
At this time no very reliable estimate
can be made on the probable division
of the acreage or as to the kind of
crops to be put in. but the prulits made
in potatoes this year" will likely cause
considerable island land to be taken
from grain and put to tubers. Onions
will probably have an increased acre
age. Considerable increase of crops
may be expected from the Manteca
country owing to the completion of the
big Irrigation ditch. Irrigation is now
receiving more attention than ever, be
fore. Viewed as a whole the outlook
for this county is regarded as most
promising and one reason for this is
the making of smaller farms from the
big tracts. Realty dealers report a
stiff demand for farming lands.
GOOD CROPS IN MERCED.
Rainfall Is Below the Average, but
Conditions Are Promising.
MERCED, Dec. 20. â The rainfall for
the season so far is two Inches, or an
inch less than that of last year at even
date, and below the average. Notwith
standing this the crop conditions are
good and plowing and seeding are in
progress.
Grain that has been sown long
enough to make a showing is doing
very well. Feed Is growing luxuriantly
and has been for some weeks. The pre
cipitation on the 17th was almost half
an inch and removed for the present
all apprehension of a dry winter. A
somewhat larger area than the last
will be sown in grain if the present
favorabje conditions continue.
KERN RAINFALL LIGHT.
Considerable Increase in Moisture
Needed Throughout the County.
BAKERSFIELD, Dec: 20.â The rain
fall so far this season has been very
light in Kern County. Only one shower
has fallen up to date, and this amount
ed to .24 of an inch at Bakersfield and
less in most other parts of the county.
It Is early yet to make any predic
tions as to the crops except that unless
there is a great Increase in the rainfall
before long the outlook will not be
good. Last season the fall was heavy
during the early part and light toward
the end, with the result that the high
hopes of the farmers for a good year
were not fully realized.
Dampening of the Ground Is Needed
SALINAS VALLEY WAITS.
in Many Sections.
SALINAS, Dec. 20. â Unless the wet
season begins very soon Monterey
County will not yield its average crops.
Plowing. which had commenced
throughout the valley, has been
stopped until after the rains. The pre
cipitation has been very slight for the
season. Ardund Salinas and the upper
end of the Salinas Valley the downfall
has only been about an inch and a
half for the season, and reports from
Soledad and San Miguel show still Iofs.
The feed on 'the hills which had
started after the early rains has dried
up, and without some heavy storms
eoon the outlook for the cattle and
sheep men will be dark. An inch this
month oritt brighten prospects consid
erably for the coming year.
KING CITY. Dec. 20.â The crop con
ditions here are favorable. In Kings
City and the vicinity .37 of an inch of
rain fell last Wednesday night. Late
rains will be needed for good crops.
The rain table for the past thirty years
shows that the best years in the Sa
linas Valley have been dry up to this
time. Those in which the rain came
late and proved highly profitable had
less than the present amount at this
date.
SOLEDAD, Dec. 20.â The acreage un
der cultivation In the immediate neigh
borhood of Soledad is about 35,000. ex
clusive of 2600 acres under irrigation,
on which alfalfa, sugar beets and po
tatoes are raised. So far not a large
portion of the acreage has boen plowed
and but a few hundred acr*>s have been
seeded <-n account of the scarcity of
rains. The farmers are waiting for
rain to rasume plowing and seeding.
They are hopeful that the rainfall dur
ing the next three months and the
April rhowra will be sufficient to in
sure fair or jrood crops. Th-? seasonal
rainfall at the close of December of
last year was twoVand a half inches,
as against the seasonal rainfall this
year cf sixty-four hundredlhs of an
inch to date.
SON'OMA IS REJOICING.
Rainfall Has Already Greatly Aided
the Farming Lands.
SAXTA ROSA, Dpc. 20. â Although
Santa Rosa's rainfall began fully a
month later this year than in the pre
vious season, the record was speedily
eclipse^ after the rains started. The
total precipitation this season to date
is 15.07 inches, as compared with
SANTA CliARA NOT ALARMED.
Soil Is Damp for Plowing and Down-
I>our Is Expected.
SAN JOSE, Dec. 20.â The rain of
Wednesday has aided , the farmers in
their plowing and seeding, and the
threatening weather since has dispelled
the fear that was .forming of an ex
tended dry spell. So far this season
the rainfall has been 2.28 inches. Up, to
the same date last year 4.19 inches had
fallen. . . â¢ >. . ; 'â¢ '
Most of: Santa Clara County is de
voted ..to the .fruit . industry, and no
alarm is felt â¢ because of the lack of
rain. A. late -winter is preferable to the
orchardist and always insures a large
crop;.. An usually large acreage is be
ing plowed and seeded. in the foothills
this year. Some of the land was'gel
ting a little dry, but the. rain that fell
Wednesday has- put it in good condition
again. The warm, weather has -brought,
up the grain already sown. Feed upon
the cattle ranges is growing rapidly,
GILROY, Dec. 20.â The rainfall, up to
date amounts to 3.10 inches. In the
mountains east and west the precipita
tion has. been much greater, giving feed
a good start. Much land iÂ» plowed, but
very little is sown as yet. The farmers,
as a rule are waiting for another good
rain before sowing. It is the late .spring

The work of the detectives to date
show* that tralnmea, station agents,
foremen, yardmen, engineers, ia fact
some persons In almost every clas3 of
employes on both railways have been
concerned. The Northern Pacific has
been the heaviest loser and ha3 already
pcid out many thousands of dollars on
shipments which seem to have sudden
ly dropped completely out of sight.
TACO3IA. Dec. 20.â The Great North
ern and Northern Pacific railways have
lost at least I10Q.0OO In freight stolen by
their own employes during the last two
years. .The gigantic operations of a
ring comprising employes of all classes
are now being investigated by nearly
three dozen detectives, the majority of
whom have been sent out from Chi
fcago.
The arrest of three men at Seattle for
stealing a carload of wheat and the
subsequent investigation these hav*
thrown seme light on the methods of
the thieves, and the clews thus secured
are being- carefully followed. It ia
known that freight cars have been
robbed of their contents and goods con
signed to one merchant sold to an
other in the same line of busiaess la
the same city.
Whole carlcad3 of goals have been
stolen and reshinped to other towns,
where the ring Is alleged to ha^e had
"fences" for the disposal of the plun
der. Tons uron tons of merchandise
has been sent to Alaska, Oregon, Cali
fornia and interior Western States,
sold for what it would bring and the
moaey was divided among those impli
cated.

which, may result ia the assassination,

The chief of the French banlc at Port

attitude cf the people of Hayti toward
President N"oni ia decidedly threaten

guilty of embezzling public funds.
The 3u5porter3 of General Wcs y Gil

members of the party arriving ca the

that a crl3i3 is approaching rapidly and
that the provisional Government fta<l3

The Julia brought news that former
President Jirninez Is now at Monte
Crtsti; that former Vice President Des
Champi is in control of Porto Plata and
that Generals Morales and Caceres are
fortifying the city of Saa Domingo.
It ia said that an attempt was re

Judge Haynes has been for years a
sufferer from heart trouble, which has
continuously manifested itself. In his
work upon the Supreme Court Commis
sion Judge Haynes has left the impress
of his great legal talent upon the case
law cf this State and his death is a
loss to the bar, the bench and to the
public. i . Â¦*
He male a refutation in his early
career in the famous "Indian squaw"
rase, which was carried to the Supreme
Court of the United States, and which
involved the title to the land whereon
is situated the city of Pittsburgh
In private life his nobility of charac
ter endeared nisi to all with whom he
came in contact. Unassuming and ap
prcachable. he always gave courteous
hearing to those who sought his at
tention, socially or cSIciaily. He was
rr.cst considerate of young men, and.
having- been for many years examiner
of the Supreme Court cf applicants for
admission to the bar. this was a qual
ity wherein many a trembling applicant
for admission to practice law found
comfcrt.
JcdgÂ» John Haynes, dean d tfce

J'zdz? Hayres was born in Washing

BERKELEY, Dec. 20. â William
Bowe, the old man found dead in his
home at Eighth and Virginia streets
last night, was a victim of congestion
of the lungs. This was determined
after an autopsy to-day by Dr. Charles
F. Gladding. The Coroner will hold
an inquest to-morrow night in the
local branch morgue.
Bowe was found lying face down
ward on the floor in his kitchen by
some boys who intended to buy some
eggs of him. The members of his
family were not present at the time
and did not suspect his being serious
ly ill, as he appeared to have only
a cold and had been around as usual.
There are some bruises on the arms
of the body, but these are supposed
to have been caused by falling.
Bowe was 61 years old and a native
of Ireland. He was a gardener by oc
cupation. He leaves a widow, and six
grown children. .

The directors, after weighing the testi

that In their Judgment there was no
foundation for the accusation.
FOLSOM, Dec. 20.â A meeting of the
State prison directors was held here to
night, there being present Directors
Felton, Wilkins, Devlin and Ray. The
most interesting episode of the meeting
was the investigation of the published
story that Daniel Kevane. formerly
secretary of the State board of exam
iners, had accepted a "rake-off" of $30
a month from the salary of C. H.
Ward, engineer at the prison, who re
ceives $125 a month from the State.
Kevane was emphatic in his denial of
the accusation. .
Ward was called as a witness and
denied that he had ever paid Kevane
or anybody else anything for getting
him the place. He said he obtained his
appointment through tne friendship of
Senator Oneal of San Jose and that
nobody ever asked him for anything on
that account. Ex-Warden Wilkinson,
who was credited with having supplied
to the board the first intimation of the
scandal coupling Kevane's name with
the alleged "rake-off," testified that all
he kney about the matter was that it
was common talk.

" The increase of commissioned offl

one year ago. The other grades show
458 captains, 24 commanders, 101 lieu

387 Junior lieutenants and 332 ensigns
making a total increase of 150 in the
ranks below flag officers. The corre
sponding totals in the 'United States

that will investigate the various items
for which bonds are proposed and re
port upon them to the Board of Trusr

committees, it will be necessary to get
a chairman not only acquainted with
the needs of the town, but also with
the . men who, ' in his Judgment, will
be best.able'to cope with the subject
under investigationl
As yet there is no one picked out
to be chairman of the committee.
President Rickard. has approached a
number of gentlemen on the commit

seems to be none who wishes to as
sume the responsibility the position
will entail. It is certain that the
chairman will be burdened with con
siderable work, *and business men,
with their own private duties to per
form, do not care to burden them
selves more, and so they are begging
to be excused. -

open the safe, had a running fight to
night with the police, during which a
policeman and night watchman were
shot and slightly wounded. One of the
burglars was knocked down and cap

. Residence property Is in demand, especially

jacent to the college grounds. Old residents of
San Francisco can remember when lots on
California street could be had for a song or a
drink. What la the price of them now? En
tirely beyond the grasp of the ordinary man.
So the time is not far off when hllUide lots of

W. J. Mortimer & Co., Berkeleyâ Though
winter is now upon us. the sales of real estate,

variation from our midsummer 'phenomenal run
of business. Capitalists are looking- for Invest
ments in our college town, for they realize our
steady growth is permanent and without any
boom .- tendencies.
Charles Adams & Co., Alameda â The Ala
meda real estate market Is brisk, but there are
very few houses to rent on account of the
heavy demand. I should advise property-own
ers to build on vacant land at once, as it ap
pears that the future will be most prosperous.
Altogether 1903 has been the most
prosperous year for the real estate men
ever known in the history of the coun
ty. Following are statements from
dealers In Oakland, Berkeley and Ala
meda:
: George ' W. Austin â The market continues
active, although there is a tendency toward
a lull during the. holidays. Keen buyers are
taking advantage' of the temporary depression,
and many bargains are being- picked up by
speculators. Alter the first of January there
will be a revival of activity. The money mar
ket is remarkably free and It is easy to secure
loans upon easier terms and In lancer propor
tionate sums than ever kefore.
The business center of th^ city has
expanded rapidly during the present
year, especially northward on San
Pablo and Telegraph avenues, and
toward the east on Eleventh and
Twelfth streets. Rents in both the
business and residence districts have
increased, in some localities nearly 30
per cent, and there are few houses or
desirable stores to be had at any price.
All of the firms which make a special
business of renting say that the supply
of cottages and small houses Is far
short of the demand.
During the year builders have been
exceedingly busy and a larce number
of houses and cottages have been
erected in Oakland, Berkeley and Ala
meda, but building has not by any
means kept pace with the increase in
the population of the three cities. In
Alameda alone seventy-seven new
houses and cottages have been built
during the year, and several more will
be begun before the close of 1903. The
building operations in Oakland and
Berkeley have exceeded those of Ala
meda, yet there are not nearly enough
houses to supply prospective purchas
ers and renters.
Among the more, important transac
tions of the year was the purchase of
the Canning block at the corner of
Thirteenth street and Broadway by
Henry A. Butters. The purchase price
of the property was $295,000.
Property in the vicinity of the new
"Key route" road from North Oakland
to Berkeley has become popular among
homeseekers, and recently another
large tract of land, between Fifty-sec
ond and Fifty-nfth streets and Adeline
street and Shattuck avenue, was placed
on the market. Negotiations are also
in progress for the purchase of a tract
217x350 feet in size, fronting on Stan
ford avenue, Just north of Shell Mound
Park.
DEALERS ARE JUBILANT.
BUSINESS CENTER EXPANDS.
Real estate dealers throughout Ala
meda County agree that the; present
year has been remarkable for r the ac
tivity of the local realty market and
nearly all express the opinion that next
year will prove fully as prosperous as
the one now drawing to a clos?. More
large sales have been made and more
property has changed hands during 1903
than in any other year in the history
of the city of Oakland, and the: same is
true regarding the erection of large
modern business blocks and 'the im
provement of stores along the principal
thoroughfares.

Miss Byrne arrived a few days ago
from Seattle. She went to the Golden
House, 462 Twelfth street. Last night
her actions were so peculiar that the
landlady, Mrs. Stoddard. suspected her
lodger was not entirely rational. At
11 o'clock this morning the roomer had
not arisen and refused to leave her
bed. Four hours later the situation
was unchanged, so the police \v*:re sum
moned. Patrolmen John Murphy and
Lon Agnew. reinforced by Policemen
Btahl and Sherry, tried to remove the
woman, after investigating. But it was
a battle every inch of the way from the
lodging-house to the hospital.
Miss Byrne said she was 39 years
old jand that her home was in Seattle.
Her* hallucinations led her to imagine
that enemies were trying to take her
life. The case will go before the
Lunacy Commissioners to-morrow.
After that the insane patient con
ttp.ued her wild fight. While Miss Ma
â¢on. the hospital matron, was attend
ing the unfortunate woman the de
mented creature suddenly grabbed the
matron's hand and sank her teeth into
the flesh, inflicting a painful Injury.
Steward Harry Borchert; who was close
at hand, himself a powerful man, had
to exert himself to the utmost to save
the matron from more serious injury.
Even in her exhausted condition the
patient fought with extraordinary
strength against the attendants. They
were compelled to use testraining
thongs, which were only put in place
after hard work to prevent the woman
from doing herself harm.
In a frenzy of maniacal dementia
Mary J. Byrne gave battle this after
noon to four stalwart policemen and
was not subdued until she had almost
exhausted the big bluecoats 5n their
effort to remove the crazed woman to
the detention ward at the Receiving
Hospital.

Meanwhile the two little girls are in
the care of Mr. Kieley. They see^ to
know very little, about their parents
and say .that .they have., been in some
convent school In R6n& Nfiv., for a long
while, and that they have never known
their mother . to act in this strange
manner before.
The officers of San Joaquln County
have been notified- to -look out for the
woman, as the people here believe that
she is demented. Â¦
i Apparently her quest was unavailing,
| for she left Livermore on Friday morn-
I ing and started to walk toward Alta-^,
mont along the railroad track, taking'
the children with her.
On Friday evening about dusk the
eldest child, a girl of 12, went to the
farmhouse of John Kleley on the Alta-*
mont road a little distance from the
railroad track, and said that her moth
er was trying to commit suicide on the
railroad track. The child was fright
ened and ran to the only house that
was in sight. Mr. Kieley went to the
I spot pointed out by the child and found
the woman acting in a very strange
manner, while the other child, a girl
of 10, was crying beside the track. Mr.
Kieley offered the woman shelter in his
house, but she refused every offer. He
protested that it was nearly night and
that her children ought not to be left
without shelter. She declared that she
wanted to go to Altamont, but- agreed
to allow the children to stay with Mr.
Kieley at his home.
The last that has been heard of the
woman was that she arrived at Alta
"mont on foot yesterday morning and
applied for food at the home of C. H.
Christensen. She told him that she was
trying to reach Tracy, and he gave
her enough for her fare to that point.
She took the morning train In that di
rection and nothing has been heard of
her since. '?....
LIVERMORE, Dec. 20.â Two aban
doned children are awaiting the return
of a mother at the home of John Kie
ley between here and Altamont. Who
they are or where they came from other
than that they once lived in Reno, Nev.,
or Truckee, Cal., and that the children
bear the name of Hill, no one knows.
The strange family made its appear
ance in this city early during the week.
The woman, who is a little over 40
years of age, was intelligent looking,
and the two children, both girls, were
bright and well dressed. The woman
gave her name as Mrs. Mary Hill and
announced that she came from Truckee
and was looking for work as a domestic
where she could secure a home for her
children. Â»
CHICAGO, Dec. 20.â "The new world
was discovered by Catholics and the
cross was planted in the- name of the
church. We cannot get it out of our
heads that Catholics will yet claim the
new world again."
This hope was expressed by Arch
bishop James E. Quigley in an address
before the Roman Catholic Woman's
League*
The Archbishop declared that the se
curity of the national constitution in
creased proportionately with the in
crease in the number of Roman Catho
lics. He urged the establishment of a
subsidiary system of the public schools
for the benefit of the Roman Catholics.
This system, "for the benefit of the mi
nority," said the speaker, "should be
paid for by the state, but controlled
by the church."
"The supreme and fundamental er
ror qf the age is liberalism," urged the
Archbishop. "Liberalism delegates to
the state all rights, and this\,is when
the state and church conflict."
The education of the child, he added,
should rest with the church and not
with the state. The Archbishop de
clared that the United States constitu
tion stood for . individualism. He as
serted that to-day the state was en
croaching on the rights of the church,
and that God was not recognized in
any of the modern constitutions.
"Protestants and non-Catholics," the
Archbishop continued, "are undertak
ing, through the public system, to pre
vent the Catholic children becoming
firmly cemented to their church and to
keep the Catholic church from getting
astronger foothold. The purpose of the
non-Caiholics is to prevent the growth
of the church. They will scruple at no
violation of justice to gain their ends.
"The state must provide schools for
the minority, as well as for the major
ity. The state should divide the public
school system and maintain a separate
system for the minority â separate in
the sense of religious teaching. The
two systems could be under one con
trol, but in the Catholic division Cath
olic principles should be taught. This
would give the minority an equal
chance with the majority.
M The cry all over the world is for
non-sectarian education. The Catholic
schools are recognized by the state, but
they are not supported by the state be
cause non-Catholics believe that It
would be dangerous for the state to
support them." Â¦ .'
WASHINGTON. Dec. 20.â The letter
of Secretary Root to Senator Proctor,
acting chairman of the Committee on
Military Affairs, giving a resume of the
military record of General Leonard
Wood and stating the chief considera
tions which led to his nomination as a
major general, was made public to-day.
After quoting from remarks commend
atory to General Wood made by Gen
erals Miles, Lawton, Graham and For
: sythe the letter relates that "upon thesa
and similar evidences of fitness Presi
i dent McKInley appointed Captain Wood
a colonel of the First Volunteer Cav
alry in May, 1838." â¢
The Secretary also quotes from tho
commendations of Generals Young,
Wheeler, Sumner and Shafter on Gen-Â«
eral Wood's conduct in the Santiago
campaign, and says General Wood's
appointment as commander of the San->
tiago province appears to have been
based on a statement made by General
Shafter In a dispatch to the depart
ment, in which he said he "thought
General Wood by far the best man to
leave In command of Santiago."
The Secretary reviews General Wood's
subsequent military career, Baying ir*
this connection:
"Upon a review of General WoodM
entire military record I think it fair to
say that no officer of the American
army below the grade of major general
has held more important commands,
rendered more distinguished services oc
demonstrated to a higher degree the
possession of qualities which fit a maa
to render valuable services to the coun*
try as a major general."
In speaking of the principles which
he says sound judgment require tho
President to follow, the Secretary says:
"The law which recognizes seniority j
alone as the title to promotions up to
the grade of colonel abandons that rule
when it deals with general officers,
and imposes upon the President the
duty of selecting the best men /or gen
erals, without expressing any limita
tion upon the class from which he is
to make the selection.
"Preyiou3 rank," continues the Sec
retary, "is of little consequence pro
vided the service shall have been long
enough to furnish the requisite experi
ence and make the demonstration of
capacity certain."
Mrs. Keener ran back into the hall
way and screamed for help. Her cries
were heard by many guest's as well as
the clerks, who ran to her assistance.
The proprietor then entered the apart
ments and at once telephoned to police
headquarters. . Detective Ed O'Dea
responded and visited the- premises.
O'Dea found that the thieves had left
no portion of the place unsearched.
The detectives have no clew as to
who the guilty parties are, but place
the time of the crime at about 9 o'clock,
when people occupying adjoining
apartments say they heard footsteps in
the rooms.. . .
Detectives were called at midnight
last night to investigate a daring bur
glary in the Ainsley Hotel, a fashion
able apartment house at 620 Turk
street. The apartments of Mrs. Ra
phella Acosta Keener were looted dur
ing the early evening, and gem-studded
jewelry valued at more than $1000 was
stolen. .Â»)*â¢*Â¦, â¢
Soon after dinner Mrs. Keener left
the Ainslee with a party of friends to
visit a theater. She says she locked the
door. About 11:30 o'clock she returned
and found everything was in disorder.
Evidence that a thorough search had
been made by burglars was, apparent.
Trunks had been broken open and their
contents scattered about the floor;
clothesÂ»were dragged from closets and
searched, and chairs and tables were
overturned.

Two French armored cruisers, Conde
and Oloire, are to undergo a similar
test as that to which the Suffren was
subjected two months ago. Prepara
tions are in progress with the Conde,
one of the turrets of which Is to be
taken off the ship and transported to
the proving ground at Gavres, near the
dockyard rOrient. The turret selected
is only about six inches in' thickness
and It is to be fired at by guns of less
than 6-inch caliber at long range. Of
ficers have volunteered to be within the
turret when the test is made to ascer
tain the effect of the concussion upon
human life within the turret. The ex
periment appears to be of little value
when it is to be considered that in act
ual warfare the turret Is as likely to be
hilt by a 12-Inch shell, in which event
both turret and its' occupants would
be destroyed. It will require twenty
days' work to remove the turret from
ship to proving grounds. \;i^
, The French armored cruiser Desait,
a sheathed vessel of 7700 tons/ 17,100
horsepower and a calculated speed of
twenty-one knots, made her speed trial
November 17, developing 17,715-hbrse
power and 20.7 knots speed. t The coal
consumption was only 1.847 pounds
per horsepower, being 30.3 pounds for
each square foot of grate surface. The
boilers are of the- Belleville type and
the performance came . well within the
limits of the contract, which- allowed
32.77 pounds of : coal to each . square
foot of grate to obtain the requisite
Horsepower.. iv=,
The battleship Suffren went put No
vember 20 to I try the of . her
submerged torpedoes and to ascertain
the : highest speed "at. which they could
be discharged, which was found to be
it seventeen knots. At r the end of this
experiment several runs were made un-
The British cruiser Flora, which re
cently ran ashore in British Columbia
waters and was taken off in a seriously
damaged condition, is one of the eight
cruisers of the.Astraca class, built in
1893. They are of 4360 tons displace
ment, 9000 horsepower, 19.75 knots, and
being intended for service on foreign
stations, where . docking facilities are
not alwayS" to be obtained, these ships
are wood-shetehed and qpppered. ' The
primary object of this is to retain as
near as possible the original speed of
the vessel and avoid the frequent dock-^
ing to clean and paint tho bottom,
which is necessary for vessels without
copper sheathing-. The additional first
cost is compensated for in a few years
through the saving in coal consump
tion and docking expenses, and, be
sides, the ship is always ready for
service. Another important advantage
of this wood-sheathing is that it con
tributes largely to the safety of the
vessel when it happens to run aground,
as the 4-inch teak planking acts as a
cushion and takes the brunt " of the
damage in contact with rocks. The
Flora owes her" salvation to the fact
of being wood-sheathed, as did the
Bonaventura two years ago when
stranded on the coast of China, and
the Crescent, which ran ashore last
year in the West Indies, but was float
ed with little injury to; the hull." It is
easily understood that the damage to
a vessel without wood-sheathing would
be far greater under similar conditions
of accidents and would probably result
In the total loss of the ship. The trans
verse frames of vessels of this class
are four feet apart and the longitud
inals, or fore and aft framing intervals,
range from three to four feet; the outer
platirfg is seven-sixteenths of an inch
thick, leaving areas of twelve to six
teen square feet of unsupported sur
faces only seven-sixteenths of an inch
in thickness to bear the weight of the
ship against rocks and other under-'
water obstructions. The addition of
four inches of teak to the outside of
the skin plating unquestionably relieves
the strain on the thin bottom plating
and makes temporary repairs by divers
possible, whereas an unprotected bot
tom would be rent and crushed and
preclude the possibility of saving the
ship.
SHEATHING AMERICAN CRAFT.
It is quite probable that the neces
sity of sheathing some of the battle
ships and cruisers to be built for the
United States navy may be brought
up again before Congress and receive
its sanction. Ex-Chief Constructor
Hichborn has advocated this system
since 1885, and in 1899 succeeded in hav
ing a law passed providing for the
sheathing and coppering of three bat
tleships, three armored cruisers and six
protected cruisers. Contracts for the
last named were awarded in Decem
ber, 1)599, and four oÂ£, these vessels have
been completed.? : The others were not
contracted for until February, 1901, and
when Hichborn was retired his suc
cessor, with the aid of other bureau
chiefs and all the contractors, prevailed
upon Congress to rescind the sheathing
clause in the. contracts, and the vessels
are now being built with unprotected
bottoms. The reduction of payment to
the builders has. not yet been settled,
after nearly three years' contention.
Hichborn's successor unexpectedly and
suddenly resigned last November, and
the present chief constructor, W. L.
Capps, is on record as being an advo
cate of sheathed ships. Mr. Capps ex
plained the subject clearly and fully to
t,he House Committee on Naval Affairs
in a meeting on March 15, 1900. In com
menting upon the objections to the
sheathing system Mr. Capps said:
"Those whose special province it is to
keep informed concerning these things
are : not of such diverse opinions, but
those whose time must of necessity be
largely occupied with other matters
sometimes err in expressing opinions
based upon Inaccurate or incomplete in
formation. â¢ * ? I say sheathing is
good for certain contingencies; I would
not sheath all vessels. It is especially
good for foreign service â service re
mote from a dock â because it is the
best means we know of to maintain
high speed and save in the consumption
of coal." This is exactly the view of
Mr. Hichborn, against which the opin
ions of non-professional men are of no
value, and it Is therefore reasonably
safe to predict that sheathing will be
one of the many new Improvements In
corporated in future new ships, con
tributing to their safety and making
them more efficient and economical. Â¦

The Ebell ladies celebrated their
twenty-seventh anniversary in charm
ing manner on Monday. Tales of the
early trials of the club were recounted
by Miss Maria Babson in interesting
fashion: Robert Lloyd, in his usual
good Etyle. rendered two solos from
"I'Pagliacci"; the Ruggles family were
given their lesson in "manners" by the
erstwhile mamma. Miss Mae Sadler,
and the nine redoubtables grasped the
whole catalogue of "dont's" in more or
less effective fashion. The urchins were
cleverly represented by the following:
Leslie Jackson. Ruth Woodbury, Jack
Britton. Delight Woodbury, Ramona
Radcliffe. Thoda Cockroft, Charles
Bowersmith. Evelyn Vosburgh and
Lewis de Wald.
The club has every cause for con
gratulation, as in its career of twenty
seven years of activity it has amused
many, educated many and aided many.
That is a career of worth, rather than
of reputation.
The ticket offered in the southland
will go down in history as the compro
mise ticket, whereon Mrs. Victor Mont
gomery was victor for the presidency,
Mrs. Van Wyck gracefully yielding to
the decision. The following ticket was
duly elected:
President, Mrs. Victor Montgomery
of Santa Ana; first vice president, Mrs.
Mathew Robinson. Los Angeles; second
vice president. Mrs. Annie West, Colu
sa; recording secretary. Mrs. A. H.
Lacey. Santa Ana: corresponding sec
retary. Mrs. E. C. Bower, Los Angeles;
treasurer, Mrs. W. A. Gosewisch; reg
istrar. Mrs. Lake, San Diego; historian,
Mrs. A. E. Queen, San Francisco.
And thus has the spirit of peace, the
spirit of the Yuletide. grown apace and
spread Its gentle wings o'er the loyal
Dixie Daughters. And here's to the
peacemakers, for they shall be called
blessedâ by the poor old men in gray, to
whom the "Daughters" are daughters
in their needs.
At the recent ball given at the Palace
by the Albert Sydney Johnston Chap
ter, under Mrs. Alfred Hunter Voor
heis' management, a splendid sum was
realized. And many a peaceful pipe will
be drawn in consequence.
Hence the meeting in Los Angeles on
Saturday, cal'.ed by Mrs. Selden S.
Wright, v."iiich was a reconvening of
the State meeting held here last Octo
ber, where Democratic ward politics
were closely followed, differing only in
Intensity.
Out of troubled seas comes the bark
of the Confederate Daughters, they who
were in much the same fix as the trans
port that came into port a few weeks
ago with two commanders, the military
man and the nautical man, with each
insisting that he and he alone was
"captain."
That the frail little bark of the
Daughters of the Confederacy had not
been dashed against the rocks of dis
sension and left ableaching upon the
sands is perhaps due to the star of
charity that guides It. And a pity it
would be that a body banded together
for the noteworthy cause of assisting
the needy soldiermenâ they who wore
the grayâ should be wrecked on the
shoals of personal controversity. It
wouldn't be nice, nor perhaps quite ac
curate, to say "spite," particularly
when the principals in the case are
women of notable charm and culture.
Ar.d herein lies the spectacular feature
of the case. However, the tomahawk
has been buried, the hammer that has
tripped merrily for some months has
been laid aside, and the happy hum of
harmony is heard in the club's realm.
When the delegates went fiom here
to Charleston with each side announc
ing a president of its own choosing, the
national conventic-n figuratively boxed
their ears and sent them home to settle
their differences.
course will prove of benefit to alL It is
logical to think thus wise: but where
have our Anglomaniacs come from?
This specie of our race is being rapidly
exterminated, however, and It is ra
tional to expect a man with brains
enough to win a scholarship will have
poise enough to hold to his nationality
and that which it stands for.
So the women of the Press Club are
having a little misunderstanding. This
fact, coupled with the little frappe af
fair of the Confederate daughters, has
furnished much amusement to the men
folk; well, as a matter of fact, there are
circumstances on record where men's
clubs have had little misunderstand
ings. These affairs are certain to arise
in all relationships that are closely al
lied, unless there be calm and well
poised leaders who'can act as "mixers,"
or conciliators, of the belligerent mem
bers.
From the array of allegations and ne
gations it would seem that a merry
war is on. However, let it be said to
the credit of the ladies that there was
dignityâ much dignityâ in the manner
of conducting the expulsion of two of
Its members, who, to all appearances,
seemed to be in good standing. It was
this round robin conduct to which Mrs.
Emeline North and Mrs. M. L. Gray
objected. And a strong, logical plea
was made for the deposed members,
who desire their case reopened. Mrs.
Pinney, the president, ruled nay, and
now comes the announcement of suits
and counter-suits.
It is hinted that the husbands of the
fair clubwomen who favored the oust
ing of the two ladles will be Joined with
their wives a.z co-defendants. Then
there will be war upon clubs. But it
is to be hoped no husband will seek to
avoid the litigation by any sinister
means, such as divorcing his wife or
leaving the country, because it will
soon blow over,' even as have other
wars, and the pleasures of peace will
dwell within the club once more. The
association is composed of altogether
too many clever women to permit dis
cord to permanently disrupt the or
ganization.
Apropos to the school Question, a
remarkable fact has just been brought
to the attention of the club, and it is
this: That the charter 'enables the
nisht schools to enroll boys and girls
who are over 14â not under. Now the
freeholders rightly felt that children
under 14 should be in day schools. So
they should. But the fact remains
that there are some thousands that are
working in stores as cash girls and
boys, in factories, or peddling on the
streets, who are under the proscribed
age of 14. Now these children, by force
of circumstances, are deprived of the
advantages of day school, while the
law, enacted for their benefir, deprives
them of the advantages of night school.
This was Quite possibly the reason that
Raphael Weill of the White House has
made arrangements with the Young
Men's Christian Association to give his
little cash boys tuition at night, like
wise the privileges of the gymnasium.
But we have not many Raphael Wellls

Superintendent Langdon, who, by the

that much of the congestion will be re

We hope so. It would be rather em
barrassing to herd a band of little
lemon peddlers Into school and discover
that the principal had no seats for
them.
A case in point occurred recently
when a rugged son of Italy rounded up
his son while engaged In the pleasant
pastime of "playing craps." He
marched him to school and into the

Luigi could not be placed In school
because there was no seat for him.
'.'What you say? No seata for my boy
âand I paya de tax? What for I paya

to be embarrassing. The door of a
classroom opened at this Juncture and
a boy passed out. Seeing an unoccupied
seat in the room, the taxpayer shoved
Luigi into the room and into the seat.
Then turning about he thanked the
teacher and the principal profusely and
departed. But It took strategry to en
able Luigi to obtain what thÂ«Â» laws of

ACCORDING to the latest statistics there are, 24425
vessels of an aggregate tonnage of 6,087,000 in the
merchant marine of the United States. The fig
ures are large, but they cease to be flattering to our pride
as a commercial nation when investigation shows that
of that amount there is only a tonnage of 879,000 regis
tered for the foreign trade. All the rest is employed
either in the fishing industries or in domestic trade.
The significance of the figures is made the more clear
when contrasted with those of 1861; at which time our
tonnage registered for foreign trade was 2,406,000 and
that licensed for domestic trade was 2,704,000. Thus in
the space of forty years our domestic tonnage has about
doubled, while our foreign trade tonnage has diminished
to about, one-third of what it. was.

Since the earthquake in Palestine
last April some one circulated the story
that the mouth of the River Jordan
had been so affected by the shock that
the level of the river had be>n altered
to such an extent that at the place
where the historic river goes into the
Dead Sea there was now a waterfall
of considerable depth and strength.
This is altogether false, and no change
whatever has taken place at or near
the mouth of the Jordan, says the
London Graphic. The writer has just
spent some days" there, and made it his
special business to investigate the mat
ter. Much has also appeared from
time to time in papers and periodicals
about steamboats navigating the Dead
Sea. This, too, is a fabrication. The
only boat on the Dead Sea is a small
sailing boat about twenty feet long.
This vessel makes trips, as the wind al

OUR commercial treaty with China was ratified by
the Senate without ' opposition. The significant
and gratifying feature in^ this action was the
recognition by Senators of the unfriendly attitude of Rus
sia. That empire has held a high hand in Eastern Asia
against our interest while all the time reminding us of
her traditional friendship. There has been heretofore a
disposition in official quarters to seemingly accept Rus
sia's own statement of her sentimental and practical
friendship, although her acts all belied her words. Now
it is admitted that the new treaty with China is less fav
orable to our commerce than it should be, because Rus
sia, backed by the presence of her army in Manchuria
and of her war fleet in Chinese waters, has China under
duress that extends to control of her treaty-making
power.
This presents a quite new international issue. The
world has not recognized such Russian suzerainty over
China, nor is it conceded by China in any treaty. Yet it
practically exists, and that not by any declaration of war
upon China, but in the palpable circumstance of the
presence of a Russian army able to make a threat ef
fective. The situation is peculiarly galling to this coun
try and the other powers concerted in the suppression of
the Boxer rebellion, for Russia's army remains, in China
by violation of her pledge made to the other powers. â¢
It is of .importance to us that in this treaty China went
as far as she dared go in expression of her friendship for
us and her hospitality to our trade. The advantages
secured will be promptly used by our merchants and the
results will serve to reveaK the far greater advantages
which we might have secured had China been a free
agent. The other commercial nations share the situation
with us. They are all hampered in making trade treaties
as we were. When the full conditions develop Russia
may find herself with something more than China on her
hands, for she may have to deal with a concert of nations
that neither respect her word nor fear her armies.
Senators of both parties agreed in characterizing the
treaty as limited by Russian duress, and it is satisfactory
that this serves a rather official' notice upon Russia that
we see through her false pretenses and unfriendly eva
sions. The trade of China, in the prospect of the prog
ress and development of her four hundred and twenty
five millions of people, is a prize 6f sufficient magnitude
to require the use of the combined surplus of the com
mercial world. .If .she were free to open her empire to
all nations then competition in commerce would be an
uplifting influence felt by all her people. We are con
vinced that Russia will not be permitted to reverse the
policy of the nations by again closing China to all trade
but her own.

The new republic of Panama is now being recognized

fewer men to Porto Rico. Its Philip
pine force is about equal to that form

however, are kept in much better order
than was the case under the nil regime.

these 43,000 are within twenty-four
hours of New York and 29.000 are with

a day 51,000 could reach the Canadian
frontier east of the Mississippi. In th?
Spanish-American war about 30 per
cent of the militia entered the United
States service. About 100,000 of the
present guardsmen have declared them
selves ready to respond to a. call by
the President. Not all of these have
the equipment necessary for field ser
vice, and it is hardly to t>e .supposed
that in the event" of war 100,000 could
be depended on for the army.
Still, the condition of the national
defense is far better than before the
Spanish war, and It is likely to improve
from year to year.

Not every inventor, however, fails to
realize large profits. The number of
successful inventors can never be fixed,
for it is only when lawsuits bring>out
the facts or the probate courts sched
ule the estates that anything like def
inite information as to the incomes of
successful inventors is disclosed. But
It is interesting to' learn that some of
the largest incomes . were received by
inventors of small things- Thus : the
man who conceived the idea of stick
ing a rubber eraser on the end of a
lead pencil made, it is said, tens of
thousands of dollars a year frbm his
invention. The roller skate and iithe re
turn ball made* their inventors mil
lionaires. The inventor of an improved
steel pen in England built up a huge
fortune and was knighted.' The shoe
lace brought millions to the man who
introduced it, and a young woman who
lived in South "Africa derived a prince
ly income out of the invention of a
curling iron. '
One of the stock illustrations used by
people who believe in the "little drops
of water, little grains of sand" Idea re
lates to .the invention of metal 'plates,
extensively used some years ago to
protect the heels and soles of boots
and shoes from wear. This invention
found its way Into court, and- the evi
dence showed that the Inventor had
made more than a million dollars ; a
year, and one year had sold nearly
160,000,000 of the little plates. â¢
"It does not follow that the practical
man has more money than the inventor,
but it frequently happens that he risks
more money aitd uses more brain ma
terial and works harder attempting to
put the idea on a practical footing than
the inventor does. He makes a for
tune, the lnvetitor dies poor, and every
one exclaims, 'The poor inventor was
robbed.'
"This is no exaggerated exhibit. I
know of many such cases. Hundreds
and hundreds of inventions which have
proved to be of great valueâ some of
them listed among the revolutionary,
the epoch-making inventionsâ would
have gone no further than the pictured

his little home and gon? heavily in

he is wealthy. Now which of those two
men deserved the fortune?"

the manor, resolved to restore It. The
restoration was completed about a
week ago, but has been so reverently
done that most of the old Saxon, Nor
man and Perpendicular work It con
tained remained intact, and an incised
"Indulgence" inscription on its south
door has been perfectly preserved.
But even if this is not true, even If
people have exhausted every power in
trying to make their married life a
blessingâ do not disrupt it except for
that last, final and sufficient reason.
You know your present ills, but you
do not know what you are flying to. If
you cannot dwell under the same roof,
then live apart. But remember .tha^
If you are unhappy and desperate
take another tack. Abandon your old
scheme of happiness. Do not any long
er try to achieve it by attempting to
extort it from your husband c-r your
wife. Try to get It by self-sacrifice.
Try to get it by giving it. Divorce will
not insure it. PflS you will take that
same selfish heart into another alli
ance.
In the second place, the people who
are contemplating divorce ought to
realize what pusillanimity and.selfish
ness prompt the vast majority of these
unholy disruptions of marriage. It was
only a few days ago that a man peti
tioned for a divorce because his wife
was getting old and he wanted 'a
younger 'one. And this is scarcely
more contemptible than the motives
that secretly prompt the majority of
the people who break this sacred tie.
In some form or other It is almost al
ways self-love. People whine and say:
"We are not happy! '.' Well, in the
name of God, be happy! You have as
good a chance as the vast majority.
Nine out of ten of the couples that
have at last achieved contentment
have won it against exactly the same
sort of odds which you are encounter
ing. "A right to be happy!" One gets
tired of this childish plaint. What most
people want of life is happiness without
effort. What most people seek in mar
riage is the adoration and slavery of
the person whom they marry.
Men marry women to have them
purr and caress and coddle them.
Women marry men to have them dress
and pet and -flatter them. Untrained
to high moral obligations, insensible to
eublimc ideals, incapable of self-con
trol, they enter into the "holy" estate
of matrimony absolutely and solely for
their own pleasure. No wonder they
make shipwreck of It. This is not true
of all people who find married life un
endurable, but it most unquestionably
is true of the vast masses, and it is
not irreverent to say that even the Di
vine Power is incapable of making such
people happy. The trouble with nine
out of ten of all the couples who find
their marriages unendurable is that
they are mad because the other party
to the contract is not willing to be a
slave -or that they themselves are not
willing to pull their chare of the load.
It is self-love that is making marriage
the despair of the age.
Undoubtedly the former answer is
the !a%v of life. But with what a wild
protest it is answered by these tor
tured human hearts; "We have been
defrauded of Â« life's greatest happi
ness." they cry. "We have a right to
be happy and are not. By what prin
ciple of justice can we be required to
pass our lives without it when it is
Just within our reach?" This is an
exceeding bitter cry. It is wrung
from bleeding hearts. It raises a
question that must be answered in ac
cordance with the eternal Tightness
in the nature of things.
In the first place, such sufferers are
bound to remember that to some great
degree < whose limits may not be ac
curately denned) their individual hap
piness must be subordinated to the
good of the state. This is a principle
against which the soul struggles in
vain. The same mysterious obliga
tion that incites men to suffer wounds
and death for the good of their coun
try on the battle field ought to in
cite them to suffer marital unhap
piness if need be. Jt is easy to re
sent and repudiate this duty, but it is
impossible to deny it. The frightful
increase of divorce is a national peril.
The very existence of righteousness
in the state is threatened by it. Not
a citizen is exempt from the respon
sibility this involves. The tories of
the revolution and the copperheads
of the rebellion were not a whit more
false to their country than are the
people who for trivial and contempti
ble reasons threaten the stability of
our government by breaking its most
solemn contract and spreading the fa
tal pestilence of easy divorces.
â¢ â¢
Everywhere the divorce mill keeps
grinding. The solemn spectacle of
homes wrecked and hearts broken by
the thousand upon thousand every
year raises the most startling ques
tions about the relation?: of the sexes.
But this is not a general discussion
of abstract principles r.or a criticism
of existing conditions. It is an ap
peal to individual men and women
Â¦\iho have made the terrible discovery
that the happiness of which they
dreamed through marriage has been
blasted by the incompatibility of their
temperaments. In all human life
there is no greater tragedy. The
slow crystallization of this suspicion
into certainty is like losing one's life
blood drop by drop. In all such ex
periences the burning question is,
"What shall we do â endure the bitter
disappointment and the ceaseless sor
row with meek resignation or disrupt
the hateful bond?

The Divorce Milts.
THE more cheerful tone in trade noted a week ago
still continues. Although this is, the season .of the
year when no activity 'whatever is expected business
is good almost everywhere and is actually expanding in
some parts of the country. The recent pessimism has
almost wholly disappeared, and now that the great
shrinkage in' values on the New York Stock Exchange
has practically ceased the gloom which was settling
down over the country has been succeeded by a feeling
of confidence and buoyancy. The retailers report an ex
cellent holiday trade and the jobbers are sending equally
bright reports. The wholesale trade of course is quiet,
as it always is just at the turn of the year.
Nobody anticipates a recurrence of the abnormal ac
tivity and high prices of 1902, however. That era is
past. A Presidential! election is the chief number on the
programme for 1004 and .business always slackens off in
Presidential years. So we need not expect great things
in 1904 unless another foreign war should arise and again
throw us into the feverish activity of a temporary boom.
But business^ activity which has war for its base is not a
healthy condition. The reaction is too severe and the
ultimate consequences too serious. Better dull'times arid
peace than activity and war.
The leading features of the current revival of trade are
a better feeling in iron, an increase in building permits
in many of the largest cities, presaging lively building op
erations next spring, the resumption of work by many
mills in different lines throughout the country, excellent
returns from the railroads, easiness in money where a
serious stringency had been apprehended, imports instead
of exports of gold, an almost complete liquidation of our
foreign obligations, a decidedly brighter feeling among
the financial interests of New York and fine crop pros
pects almost everywhere. Against these encouraging
features, however, we have an unsatisfactory cotton mar
ket, with higher prices checking the demand and pro
ducers restricting output, a diminished demand for flour
in the West and Northwest, which has caused a number
of mills in Minneapolis to shut down; a decrease in bank
clearings and an increase in failures. The loss in bank
clearings last week was 13.^ per cent as compared with
1902, with more losses than gains among the dozen
largest cities. The failures for the week were 329,
against 267 last year.
The provision market, which is an excellent barometer
to trade, is showing more tone, with the Western pack
ers accumulating stock in their cellars, expecting to get
higher prices for it in the near future, while at the same
time they are trying to beat down the price for hogs.
The New England footwear factories are sending in good
reports, but the cotton and woolen textile mills do not re
port any activity in their lines. Raw cotton is-high and
unsettled, which keeps manufacturers nervous and afraid
to buy heavily, while, wooUis simply dull.
The condition of 7r#i^t on; this coast is largely a reflex
of that throughput the .eastern sections of the country.
Business in general is better here, than there, however.
There is a steady demand for the products of our farms
and orchards,- which is cleaning up everything that .we
produced this year and at good prices as a rule. Many
branches of agriculture are more than prosperous. Our
dairymen have had successively three or four of the best
years they ever had. The grain growers and hay farm
ers have been getting fine prices for their wheat and for
age. The hop growers have been selling their crop at
more than 100 per cent over the cost of production. The
livestock raisers have found a ready market for their
stock at better prices than were thought possible five
years ago. The canners and fruit driers have been active
purchasers of the staple orchard products for several sea
sons. Wool, though dull at the moment, has brought in
fine returns to the owner of sheep. The exports from
San Francisco by sea during the first eleven months of
1903 amounted in round numbers to $44,000,000, as com
pared with $38,392,000 during the corresponding period
in 1002, and $37,450,000 in 1001. Besides these exports
enormous quantities of produce went out of the State by
rail. It is 'expected that the sea exports from San Fran
cisco during the calendar year now closing will amount
to about $50,000,000. What better showing could Cali
fornia expect than that contained in this paragraph?
Of course this agricultural and mercantile prosperity is
having a mighty effect on the pockets and spirits of the
community. San Francisco is growing as it never grew
before. Great buildings are going up on all sides and
every mechanic in town can get all the work he, wants at
wages which would have turned his head a few years
ago. This activity in building, has stimulated the real
estate market and realty prices have gone up sharply
during the past several years, while thousands of pieces
of land have' changed hands. Innumerable building lots,
held for years by owners who were unable to improve or
not sufficiently speculative . to build upon them, have
passed into the hands of moneyed men, who are putting
up all sorts of structures, modernand attractive. The
San Franciscan who returns after an absence of- ten
years elsewhere no longer knows the town. From pres
ent indications the transformation during the ensuing
ten years will be equally pronounced.
This expansion in the city is being duplicated in the
country, where the^ thousands of Eastern and Westerji
colonists, taking advantage of the low transportation
r.ates offered by the railroads, are buying up tracts, off
, the grea^ ranches and turning the State from a great
wheat field and stock range into a country of small and
highly cultivated farms, the best basis for a State's pros
perity. Land that could not be sold a few years ago is
now being transferred to these newcomers, and from all
over the State come reports of activity in land transac
tions and at better prices than owners expected . to
realize. Of course under these conditions the State and
city cannot be anything else than prosperous.
Yvonne's papa met Photis Frettos at
the door and told him that on that very
morning Yvonne had married the ship's
cook with the starched skirt. And the
laugh which Yvonne's papa then gave
shriveled the cockles of Protis Frettos'
heart.
Photis Frettos sold pineapples and
bananas down on East street. Every
day, sunshine or fog, found Photis
there, waving a frayed duster over
the stock of rusty frtiit and smoking
innumerable cigarettes. But Photis
also took in a goodly number of nickels
and dimes and as each piece of money
was slipped into the little cigar box
Photis, would smile a faint smile, for
each clink of the silver in that box
brought him nearer to , black-eyed
Yvonne â Yvonne, the girl with the lus
trous hair and full, round lips â Yvonne,
who had promised to be his wife.
But there blew into the bay with the
trades a ship's cook from Crete. That
ship's cook was a great bronzed man
with fiercely curling mustachlos and a
swagger of the sea in his gait. On
Sundays he wore the starched and
fluted skirt of the fatherland with the
gay silk scarf tied about his middle.
He had been a fisherman under the em
ploye of Yvonne's pap back on the
Aegean. He visited Yvonne's papa for
old sake's sake.
Ah! that fluted skirt of the father
land and that brave silken scarf; how
the baggy trousers of Photis Frettos
did shrivel into Insignificance before
such an array! And Yvonne, what
thought she? '
The Sunday's trade was slack, so
Photis Frettos trundled his cart back
to the little shack on Broadway and
climbed the long hill up to where the
old castle used to stand. In the pocket
of his shiny coat he carried a precious
bank book; the long line of Ink figures
added up at last to the goodly sum
which sweet Yvonne of the black eyes
had set as the signal for the wedding
bells.
Marriage is a sacred thing:. There Is a
mystery in it. A certain " holiness In
heres in that strange relationship. It
carries Its own avenger in. Its bosom.
We may not lightly trifle with its au
gust nature. Think of the dangers of
divorce: think of Us disgrace; think of
its possible regrets; contemplate Its al
most . certain self-reprdaches.
It is best to be patient and resigned.
Whatever we sav. however much we
may rage and protestâ individual hap
piness is not the object of existence In
this life. To do one's duty is the su
preme obligation. It is right to desire
happiness and to labor for it. But It is
sheer Idiocy to be mad and frantic be
cause we do not find it. There are no
marriages or very few where it has not
been secured by never-ending self-ab
negation and effort. And even where

piness of the rare ideal marriages) oc
curs without effort it Is because those
hearts were unselfish to begin with.
subsidized foreign competition and is unprotected by the
Government. Laws as old as the nation, framed by
Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and their suc
cessors, exclude foreign vessels from 'the coast trade,
the lake. trade, and. the river trade of the United States
and reserve absolutely to American vessels the carrying
of freight and passengers from one. American port to an
other. But while the coast, lake and river shipping has
been thus protected and has prospered a9 has no like ton
nage in the world the American fleet registered for ocean
carrying from an American" to a foreign port has had none
of the consistent protection which has been bestowed
upon other industries."
Facts and figures of that kind hardly require comment.
The plain story carries its moral straight to the mind of
any one who is sufficiently interested to give it any at
tention at all. Under a system of protection our domes
tic merchant marine has kept pace with our growth as a
nation, while without such protection our deep sea mer
chant fleets, exposed to the competition of subsidized
lines of other nations, have been well nigh driven from
the ocean. Surely it requires no argument upon that
showing to convince intelligent men that if we would
have a merchant fleet capable of carrying our foreign
commerce we must grant it the protection which has been
accorded with such good results to our coasting fleets
and to our industries on land.

day's exercises opened with the pon

still in possession of Louisiana, a
to which Andrew Jackson went
immediately after the battle of New
Orleans to hear the high mass of
thanksgiving suns for the victory of
the American army. Festooned in the
great nave were the flags of the three
celebrating nations â Spain. France and
the United States. The immense audi

mass. The regular choir of the cathe

Following the mass there was a re

Joseph Tyson, aged 78 year*, and who
resided at 2728 Howard street, was
found dead In bed in his room in the

the house of Mrs. Washburn at that
address and had done odd Jobs for his
living. Mrs. Washburn sent Miss Mur
phy, a young woman in the house, to
Tyson's room to call him for break
fast. The door was partly ajar and
on approaching the room the young
woman detected the odor of Illuminat
ing gas and on pushing open the door
she was horrified to see the aged roomer
lying dead on the bed.' On investiga
tion by the Morgue officials the stop
cock of a little stove connected with
the cas Jet was found to be turned
partly on.
Tyson was a mining expert by pro

Mrs. Washburn's for the last year. He
was a native of Pennsylvania.
Miss Crowley had been in a danger

young woman was a laundress and was
discovered unconscious by her landlady,
Mrs. Schmidt, at 626 Golden Gate ave

partly turned on and at .the time it
was thought that death had been the
result of accident. Investigation by the
doctors at the Emergency Hospital re
vealed the fact that the unfortunate
young woman was in a delicate condi
tion at the time of her death. It Is
probable that despondency, due to this
fact, caused her to end her life. It Is
the duty of the Coroner to have autop
sies performed on bodies in Fuch cases.
That of Miss Crowley was not taken
to the Morgue, however, -but was al

the late residence of the deceased.

WISHED TO EXD HER LIFE.
The prewsome record of the Morgue
for deaths by gas asphyxiation was
broken yesterday. Never before have
there been so many deaths in this city
from this cause in an equal period of
time. In half a day the black wagon
conveyed five bodies to the public char
nel house behind the Hall of Justice.
There were the remains of a young
woman who had sinned and sought a
shore where charity extends over all;
of two Japanese, who could not read
the warning written in English and
blew out the light; of two laborers, who
passed from the sodden stupor of alco
hol to the unending sleep through the
half turning of a key that had been
turned fully, and cf an aged man who
breathed the gas that escaped as he
Blept from an insecure stopcock on a
cooking stove.
All of the deaths were accidental with
the exception of that of the woman.
Miss Jennie Crowley. She died at the
Emergency Hospital two days after
having supposedly turned on the gas
with suicidal intent.
The dead room of the Morgue was
taxed to its utmost owing to the six
bodies of the gas victims being added to
the usual number, and many of the
bodies had to be placed on the floor, the
number of slabs being insufficient.
Coroner Leland, in speaking of the
awful record yesterday, said that if the
watchmen and other people employed at
nights in the various lodging houses of
the city would pay more attention to
the welfare of their roomers the great
number of accidental deaths resulting
from asphyxiation would be cut down
materially. These employes, he said,
should b<Â» instructed regarding the au
dible symptom of a person passing into
the ' anesthetic state produced by the
monoxide â the deep and stentorious
breathing of the victim. Many lives
would perhaps be saved before they
had gone beyond medical aid if this
were done, said the Coroner.
The room was a- small one, and the
gas Jet had the proper warning in the
way of a "don't blow out the gas" sign
attached to it, but the little brown men
could not read it. It is presumed that
they, blew out the light, as the jet was
found wide open.
Two Japanese fishermen, I. Marakami
and T. Kawabta, who recently returned
from the Hawaiian Islands, rented a
room in the lodging-house kept by Mrs.
Kate Miller at 416 O'Farrell street Sat
urday night about 11 o'clock, and in the
morning were found dead. S. Kohi

their room to call them and on opening
the door was terrified to find the corpses
of his fellow countrymen- lying across
each other on the bed.

and the murder. of "Old Shakespeare"

recalled by the discovery to-day of the
mutilated body of a woman in a sail
ors' resort of the lowest typo In James
slip, near the river. The woman, Sarah
Martin, a. notorious, character of the
"Cherry Hill" section, went to the place
last night accompanied by a man, who
registered the pair as Carl Nelson and
wife. The man left the hotel this after
noon and a,n hour later the body of his
companion was found. The woman's
throat had been cut and the body was
otherwise frightfully mutilated. She
evidently had been killed while asleep,
as the condition of..the room pave no
indication of a struggle.
Two bundles which the man had car
ried into the hotel were found in the
room. One contained two shirts, which
bore blood marks, one as if a bloody
knife had been wiped on it. and the
other bundle contained an old pair of
men's shoes. On the wrapper was
written the name "B. Bleno," and near
by were two purchase checks of a
Bridgeport, Conn., firm, showing that
a pair of shoes and a sweater had been
bought on Saturday.
The man wore a sweater when he
left the hotel. The Bridgeport police
were notified and local detectives have
gone there in search of clew^.

NEWFOUNDLAND COAST
SWEPT BY A BLIZZARD
LONDON, Dec. 21.â Considerable
resentment is shown in the English
press over the reference to Waterloo
made by Emperor William on Satur
day at a banquet in Hanover in honor
of the anniversary of the Hanoverian
regiments, when the Emperor said as
he raised his glass "to the health of
the German legions in memory of
their incomparable deeds, in conjunc
tion with Blucher and the Prussians,
rescued the English army from de
struction at Waterloo."
The Chronicle, the Standard and
other papers protest this morning
against what the Chronicle calls the
Emperor's "preposterous claims."

WASHINGTON'. Dec. 20.â When
"Uncle Joe" Cannon was mad? Speaker
ho renewed acquaintance with the
domon of indigestion, whi^h has ha
rassed the later years of his life. To
lv- cautious Cannon warned his daugh
ter, who is the head of his house, that
while their own latch string was ever
out and he loved his friends as of old,
she must under no circumstances ac
cept invitations for him to more than
f.vo dinners a week. So far he has
been able to maintain this rule, but
his hundreds of friends in town have
learned the limit and to make them
tclves "solid" as his dinner host, have
fa!lÂ«n into the habit of inviting him
â¢\eeks ahead. With the invitations be
fore him it is pretty hard for the
Sneaker to tell which he most wishes
to accept, but the remembrances of
th* pangs of indigestion r?mind him
of his Eworn limit and he pathetically
turnB the matter over to Miss Cannon.
It is known that "Uncle Joe" will,
for love of his friends, accept an in
vitation to a really fashionable func
tion at times, but the dinner he most
longs for is where the menu is limited
to the simplest things the market af
fords, where the "boys" are all in
vited to assemble about the board and
where with song and Jest th.-> future of
politics affords themes.

The Golden Gate Tennis Club has de

California Tennis Club will hold a
handicap ..' doubles . event ; Christmas
morning and a class singles New Year's
Day. ..The I Christmas : tourney will be
finished on Sunday, as many of the
players are desirous' of attending the
football game Christmas afternoon.

An exciting doubles match was played
between Will Taylor and Joe Tobin and
Will Collier and Dr. H. P. Hill. Hill
took Frank Â¦ Mitchell's place and al
though his team lost ; he was not to
blame for it. Taylor and Tobin are de
veloping into a strong team and before
long will be worrying the championship
men. â¢ Last Sunday they beat Mitchell
and Salisbury three straight. They had
a much harder time with Collier and
Hill, but managed to w* n both sets
played. Tobin and Taylor will play to
gether in the tournament on Friday.
The following matches were played:
The two tennis matches Drummond
MacGavIn and Will Allen started two
weeks ago were completed yesterday.
Both were won by MacGavin. Early
In the afternoon the two met on the
California Club courts. It was the
finals of the Thanksgiving day tourna
ment and MacGavin had a lead of two
sets to one] and 5â5 in the fourth. Mac-
Gavin won* the first two games played,
giving him the match. Allen almost
won the second game, but Mac got in
a couple of good drives and won. â¢
Immediately after this match Allen
and MacGavin appeared on . the park
courts. In this match Allen had two
sets to his opponent's one, but Mac-
Gavin led at 4â2 in the fourth set. The
latter won 6â4 and made it sets all.
In the fifth set- the real struggle com
menced. It was one of the best ever,
played on the public courts arid went
to MacGavin after twenty-six games
had been played, the score being 14 â 12.
MacGavin won the first three games
and it was thought he would have no
difficulty Â¦ In annexing the set. Allen
as usual was slow to start, but when
his opponent had' reached 3â0 he won
the next four games straight. The
ninth game went, to Allen, making the
score 5 â 4 in his favor. After this first
one was in the lead and then the ether
and the spectators were on edge until
MacGavin, with a burst of speed, took
the two games necessary to give him
the match. . Â¦
It is expected Bert Oliver will be
selected to referee the big grame and
that Major Collins will umpire. The
latter officiated at all the games played
at Stanford this season.
The Indians left Salt Lake yesterday
for this city and are- due here to-mor
row night. They will be quartered at
the Occidental. They will practice at
Richmond on Wednesday, probably in
the afternoon.
Seats for the game will be placed on
sale this morning at Clabrough, Gol
cher & Co.'s. From the interest shown
in the contest by the college men a
large attendance is assured.
These sinewey- giants of the gridiron
are not playing on their past reputa
tions. They have trained faithfully, in
the limited time at their disposal and
expect to make a gallant stand against
the men of the East. Twenty players
responded to Manager "Pete" Smith's
call yesterday and appeared at the
Presidio athletic grounds for flt-ld prac
tice. They formed. interference for the
kickoff and for running in punts. There
was some tackling and falling on kicks.
They also tried starting. . All the for
mations were gone through Jn all the
plays and some trick plays were tried
also.
Leadbetter* of the University of Ne
vada, who will play quarterback, ar
rived here last night. He will act as
fteld captain under Gelssler and will
give the signals. He is a fast, clever
player and uses good judgment in play
ing a team.
Martin of Reliance will play left
tackle. ,
When â¢ the Reliance All -California
football eleven faces the far-famed
Carlisle Indian team on Christmas day
at Richmond field the lineup will be
fairly bristling with the names of men
famous in football history. .

Contrary to the general opinion and
the predictions of the experts the
match between the Vampire and Occi
dental association football teams yes
terday afternoon on the cricket ground
at' Webster street, Alameda, proved ex
ceedingly' close. The Vampires won
1 goal to 0 by a point obtained in the
last fifteen minutes of play.
The ball was kicked off at 2:30 p. m.,
the Vampires defending the south goal
and -the Occidentals the north goal. In
the first half neither team was able to
score, though the Vampires had sev
eral shots at the Occidentals' goal, all
of which were well saved by Chivers,
the goalkeeper.* Petersen played a
sure, steady game at back; Langdale
and Harwood were conspicuous on the
halfback line, and Wilding and Show
ell did excellent work on the wings.
The Vampire wings centered the ball
well, but could not get it between the
posts, the first half ending without
score for either side. The Occidentals
worked hard, but their combination
play was not so good aÂ« that of their
opponents.
In the. last third of the second period
the Vampires made a hot attack on
their opponents' goal and put the ball
between the posts. J. Casser was ref
eree, with L. R. Gillchrest and George
McPherson as linesmen. The teams
occupied the following positions:

Eddie Hanlon showed his many ad
mirers who visited his training camp
at Croll's Gardens yesterday afternoon
that he is in condition to put up a fast
fight, hand out all brands of money
winning: punches and take his share of
the punishment without feeling bad or
dizzy about it! Six hundred persons
crowded into the little fighter's gym
nasium to see him go four fierce rounds
with Fred Landers and Jack Burke.
He took on each opponent alternately,
and the fast pace they set for Eddie did
not appear to affect his breathing ma
chinery.
Landers used a straight left on Han-
Icn, and the latter retaliated with
some uppercuts that made the recipient
long for a soft spot on his chair. In his
second round with Burke, Hanlon
worked his famous guard on the other
man, who, try as he would, could not
penetrate the pile of gloves that seemed
to cover Eddie's head and Jaw. Toward
the close of the round Hanlon cams
out like a turtle and scored a swing on
Burke's chin that rocked the latter, who
would have gone to the floor had not
Harry Foley, who was near by, held him
up. Hanlon's appearance pleased his
friends. It was the general opinion that
he has improved in his hitting powers.
He does not swing as frequently as he
was wont to do, and his blows now
have the sting in them that begets re
sults.
Young Corbett did some road work
yesterday, and in the afternoon did
some light exercising in the gymna
sium.

HUNDREDS VIEW HAXLOX'S
TRAINING PREPARATION'S
The poloists in white administered a
crushing defeat to the reds yesterday
on the field of the Burlingame Country
Club. The score was eight goals to
two. A large gallery watched the ex
citing play throughout, evidencing the
marked interest taken in the game this
season.
The comedy of the game was fur
nished by Charley Dunphy, who played
number one for the whites. To him
was delegated the task of "riding off"
Lawrence McCreery, one of the strong
est of the opposing players. Dunphy
did his work well. No matter in which
direction the ball was driven and de
fpite the most desperate riding on the
part of McCreery, he could not reach
it. Several times Dunphy allowed him
the pleasure of a stroke at the ball, but
at the proper moment he would give
McCreery"s arm a slight touch and he
would miss the shot by a wide margin.
McCreery v.as angry and showed it. but
that did not help matters. It only tend
ed to increase the hilarity of the spec
tators.
It is claimed by experts that Dunphy
has hardly an equal at this game in
any country, especially -when he is as
veil mounted as he is at present.
The veteran R. M. Tobin played the
star game of. the day. He scored five
cf the eight goals made by his team
and was in the thickest of every scrim
mage. He showed to particular ad
vantage on his gray pony Rosina,
which has a great turn of speed.
The teams were made up as follows:
Whiles. Reds.
H. M. Tobin, T. A. Driscoll.
<\ Dnnptajr. li. McCreery,
J. Lawscr.. V. J. Carolan,
C Raoul-Duval. K. Howard.
The game was the first of the season
in which six periods of ten minutes
each cere played. It was also one of
the fastest games, although a number
Df new ponies were used, and the field
being soft was badly cut up. The reds
tcored their first goal soon rfter play
commenced. Lawrence McCreery send
ing: the ball between the posts. Tom
D? iscoll scored the second and last
goal for his team in the third period.
A pony blocked his firs* try for goal,
but at the second attempt he scored.
Lawrence McCreery's fighting spirit
vas aroused by Dunphy's riding off
tactics and he played a desperate game
in the fourth period. He ran the ball
across the field once, but Lawson
drove outside and prevented him from
scoring.
In iddition to the five goals contrib
uted to the whites by R. M. Tobin
CJtv.ley Dunphy scored one and C.
Raoul-Duval two.
The play at Burlingame suffers from
lack cf team work, each man playing
â¢Â¦in 'Jiis own account. Instead of driv
ing tl-.Â«* ball to the center there is a
tendency to get possession and then
try to handle it alone.
There will be no game on Christmas

season will be played on New Tear's

The last of the year's shooting con
tests at Schuetzen Park rifle range yes
terday was a pronounced success. A
large number of riflemen were on hand
endeavoring to make as high a score as
possible in order to bring their yearly
average to a high point. Great inter
est was centered in the bullseye shoot
of the California Schuetzen Club. Many
members believed some of the . good
scores made during the year would be
broken yesterday, but the bad light
that prevailed prevented high-class
performances.
During the luncheon hour Phllo Ja
coby, president of the California
Schuetzen Club, distributed the special
prizes wbn during the year. Otto Bre
mer won the gold medal and the silver
loving cup presented by Mr. Jacoby
for the marksman making the highest
score during the year. Al Gehret won
the silver service presented by Adam
Brehm for making the highest seven
scores, and Frank Bremer and Henry
Becker carried off two gold medals.
Chris Meyer, with his good score of
70 points, proved high man for the year
in Â¦ the competition of. the California
Schuetzen Club. He was closely fol
lowed by Max Kolander and M. F.
Hartter, while Martin F. Blasse â¢ and
A. Rahwyler made scores but a: few
points behind.
In the final yearly contest of Grutli
Club A. Stueder succeeded In winning
the Adam Brehm gold medal with 789
points to his credit. Al Gehret, with
the good score of 438 rings, won the
champion medal in the monthly compe
tition.
The match on the Presidio Athletic
Grounds yesterday morning between
the Thistle and Independent associa
tion football teams was keenly con
tested, the Thistles winning by two
goals to one.
Some changes were made in the In
dependents' team. Powers being un
able'to play on account of an injured
foot. The Independent forwards
played an excellent game, but the This
tle defense proved too strong to be
pierced. The ground, especially In the
northern half of the field, was wet and
slippery, the players coming to grief
frequently.
After several attempts on the Inde
pendents's goal at the . northern end
the Thistles scored a goal from a
scrimmage. The Fay brothers played a
strong game in the forward line of the
Independents, while Nolan and Mech
els did good work in the halfback line.
Lynch's defense was excellent. In the
second period the Independents defend
ed the south goal, and, placing the
ball between the posts, equalized the
score. Thistles, 1 goal; Independents,
1 goal. The Thistles, however, played
a steady, aggressive game, and secured
a second goal. In the forward lines
the Disher brothers and Lydon did
good work, but Smith seemed singu
larly inert. C. W. Irish was referee,
with J. D. Robertson and L. R. GI11
chrest as linesmen. The teams lined
up in the following order:

variety. How much better It wpul^
have been for the citrus, business of
California If the Australian navel had
never been introduced ana mixed with
the genuine Washington navel.
There is hardly an old-established
orchard which has not more or less
mixtures In It. These orariges naturally
drift Into the market and their Infer
iority detracts from the value of the
1 true navel, causing annoyance and losa
to packer and grower alike.
The same state of affairs Is liable to
arise In the growing of flgs unless
growers exercise proper precautions.
It. is an unfortunate fact that the ear
lier Importations of Smyrna fig cuttings
into California have been found to be
badly mixed. , No less than four varie
ties have been found growing on the
Vina ranch alone. All of . this would.
Indicate that the cuttings sent from
Smyrna were most likely taken from
a fig garden (the name applied to all
fig orchards In Asia Minor) started from
seed, otherwise there could not have
been so many varieties among the trees
syil to be found growing in California.
In my travels through the fig' dis
tricts of Asia Minor I took particular
pains to inspect a number of orchards,
and It was only in rare instances that
I found any variety outside of the Lop
Injlr, which is Identical with the vari
ety which has been designated as the
"Calimyrna" In California. Occasion
ally "a Kassaba was found growing
among the Lop Injir flgs, but very few
of any other varieties, with which I
was familiar, were to be seen.
If steps are taken promptly to graft
all the Adriatic varieties of figs Into
the Calimyrna it will only be a ques
tion, of a few years when California
will be. shipping fully as many tons of
'this variety as she is of Adriatics to-
poration of Lodi Is also being discussed.
The Stockton Mall says that the con
struction of a first-class hotel for
Stockton would seem to be assured.
The Lodi Sentinel says that the pros
; pect Is good for large immigration from
j the East into the San Joaquin Valley
i in the spring.
The Petaluma Courier says that Pet
aluma will have a new theater.
According to the Oxnard Courier
James K. Fulkerson is trying to locate
a machine shop at Oxnard.
. Gilroy Â¦ now has its own gas plant,
which has just been accepted by the
tlon bureau. This gives increased fa
cilities to visitors and home-seekers.
The number of visitors at the exhibit
room for the month ended the 10th
inst., according to the report of Mana
ger Briggs, aggregated a little more
than 8000.
It must be* apparent to the most cur
sory observer that the success which
California has attained In fruit grow
ing Is directly attributable to the fact
of her taking the best of certain fruits
grown in the old world and under our
more favorable climatic conditions and
improved methods of handling and
packing creating a demand which has
become permanent.
Individual success in growing flgs, or
any other variety of fruit, can only be
accomplished by starting with the right
pense in connection with the growing
of the true commercial fig, and it is
such a small matter that It is not
worthy of consideration.
The drying and handling of the
Smyrna fig or "Calimyrna," as we have
designated the true fig of commerce, to
distinguish It. from the other Smyrna
varieties, costs considerably less than
the drying of the white Adriatics.
The opening prices for dried Adriatics
this Beason was 3V4 cents per pound,
an Inflated price by the way, brought
about by competition among the local
packers and not warranted by the mar
ket price of the packed goods. This
price has steadily declined until to-day
figs of this variety can be bought at
1*4 cents a pound, with practically no
market Justifying this price.
Calimyrna flgs sold at 6 cents per
pound delivered in the sweatbox. I do
not wish to infer that they will always
bring this price. They will, however,
always have a value in the commercial
world, based on the law of supply and
demand, with many factors in their
favor. Deliveries can be made a month
earlier, and our goods will be put up
with more care, . will be cleaner, and
last but not least, they will be packed
in attractive packages, all of which
will tend to give them the lead.

"Alameda County has a lars^ octagon
stand in the center aisle, on which Is
shown -a. large ; assortment of fruits,
cereals, vegetables and dried fruits.
The base of this stand is made of the
brick manufactured in this county.
There are also several cases of this ar
ticle exhibited. One of the interesting
features of Alameda County is a com
plete exhibit of beet sugar, showing the
beet in its natural form and the vari
ous stages of development up to and
including the finished article.
"San Joaquin County has a stand
similar to the one described for Sac
ramento. Its exhibit has received much
attention from the representatives of
that locality and shows a very compre
hensive line of its products â pears,
plums, grapes, nectarines, peaches,
lemons, oranges, sugar beets, onions,
corn and chickory, showing the pre
served root and the stages through
which It passes before it is used as an
adulterant for coffee. The exhibit of
dried fruits, nuts and cereals In their
variety, together with wine and olive

tractive redwood wall stand, upon
which is placed handsome Jars of nuts,
plums, grapes, oranges, pears, lemons,
rhubarb, peas, etc. There Is also an
attractive display of wines and olive
oil, soils and cereals.
SOME VALLEY COUNTIES.
"Fresno County is represented by a
stand recently built for the express
purpose of exhibiting their products to
the best advantage in the State Board
of Trade rooms. Dried fruits and
raisins and figs form a prominent feat
ure of this display, but It also has an
attractive exhibit of green deciduous
and citrus fruits, olive oil, wines,
pickled olives and preserved fruits, as
well as an exhibit of perroleum in' its
crude and refined stages.
"Tulare County's stand Is built of se
lected curly and burl redwood, having
shelves and compartments upon which
are exhibited pomegranates, oranges
and lemons, citron, olives, deciduous
fruits In their variety, persimmons,
grapes, quinces, cereals and dried
fruits.
"Kern County has a large stand in
the center aisle which contains a full
assortment of its products, including
vegetables, green deciduous and citrus
fruits, nuts, cereals, dried fruits and
apples. The prominent feature is a
collection of oils from the principal re
fineries of that locality showing this
product in all stages from the crude to
the refined oil. Above the stand is sus
pended photographs of a birdseye view
of the city of Bakersfleld on one Bide
and on the other a panoramic view of
the Kern River oil fields.
LOS ANGELES ON HAND.
"Los Angeles County is represented by
a large stand, the lower part of which
is divided into sections In which are
placed, under glass, cereals, nuts, dried
vegetables, seeds and silk. Above this
are a number of shelves upon which
can be seen pineapples, citron, oranges
and lemons, onions, quinces, plums and
other fruits in variety, together with a
full line of dried fruits. The base of
this stand is of black velvet upon which
are placed gold letters, making the
name 'Los Angeles County* very promi
nent."
The recent effort of the State Board
of Trade to get a renewal of county ex
hibits at the Ferry building and to se
cure exhibits from counties not now
affiliated is meeting with satisfactory
results. During the week representa
tives from three countiesâ Mr. Chltten-
The year 1900 marked a new ,era in
the fig industry of California. In that
season the first Smyrna figs were pro
duced, being six tons of dried figs. In
1901 twenty-five tons were harvested
and in 1902 thirty-eight tons, and this
year the crop increased to sixty-five.
Buch success so closely , following the
establishment of the blastophaga or fig
wasp should have convinced the most
skeptical that the business of growing
the true commercial fig in California
was firmly established.
It is not necessary for me to empha
size the fact that anything new and
outside of that which people are ac
customed to Is beset with difficulties,
and this has been amply illustrated in
the fig business. In the first place It
was predicted by the know alls that
the bugs would die during the first cold
snap that was experienced.
When this prediction was not verified
it was claimed that the Smyrna figs
would r.ot bear like the Adriatics, and
some of my solicitous friends even -went
so far as to credit me with scientific
knowledge, one thing I am sorry to say
I do not possess, saying that it would
be useless for any one else to engage
in this business on account of the many
complications in connection with it.
The results thus far ootalned In grow
ing the Smyrna fig in California ought
to sot at rest once and for all the pes
simistic reports which have been cir
culated.
COMMERCIAIj FACTS.
During the past season a careful and
accurate account was kept of the labor
of distributing the proflchl or June crop
of Capri figs. Over 200,000 of these flga
were distributed in our orchard, at an
expense of $1 15 per acre. More figs
were really distributed than necessary,
but having a good, supply on hand it
was concluded best to distribute them.
This, then, is the only additional ex-
den of the Fresno Chamber of Com
merce, Mr. Mlot of the Tulare Board of
Trade and Ben L. Brundage of the
Bakersfleld Board of. Trade â have been
here to examine their respective exhib
its and have all expressed an Intention
to renew and enlarge in a manner that
will bring these counties into more con
spicuous notice. In comparison with oth
ers represented. <'â¢Â¦-,'

Local Exposition
Suggests Rare
Chances.
Victor Johansen, who is located a
short distance north of Arroyo Grande,
commenced experimenting in seed
growing: some four or five years ago.
The coming season he will farm from
one hundred to one hundred and fifty
acres, producing seeds of many thou
sand- dollars In value and giving re-Â«
munerative employment to many peo-.
pie.
John Badger, formerly engaged in
seed growing in the southern part of
the State, has acquired a forty-acre
tract near Arroyo Grande and it is
probable that more land will be rented.
D. D. Barnard has been experiment
ing in seed growing a few miles north
of San Luis Obispo. His experiments
establish the fact that there in a larga
area in the county which can be profit
ably devoted to fhe business.
Smaller growers have been engaged
In seed farming in the vicinity of Ar
royo Grande for a few years. All have
met with success- and are gradually
increasing their acreage. The business
has proved very profitable. There has
never been a failure, though all crops
have been grown without irrigation.
If past successes are any forerunner
of the future San Luis Obispo County
is soon to become known as one of the
great seed-growing centers of the
State.
Attention has been given not only to
the few varieties already mentioned.
but nearly all kinds of seeds have teen
grown in this county and all the prod
uct has found a ready market with the
large Eastern dealers. This year, at
the beginning of the season, orders for
more than $15,000 worth of seed were
turned down as had been made for the
entire crop. The large orders were due
to the excellent quality and remarkable
fertility of the San Luis Obispo seeds.
A number of experiments conducted
by one of the prominent Eastern deal
ers with seeds raised in this county
has made a record for the local product
of over 93 per cent of fertility. Eastern
grown seed as a rule will not germinate
after the second year, but California's
product preserves its vitality for many
years. Peter Henderson of New York
a few years since experimented with a
variety of seed grown in this county,
five years old, and 90 per cent of thÂ«
seed under the test germinated.
Last year the product of one com
pany sold for $35,000. The same con
cern received $50,000 for its crop. Farm
ing is carried on over a large area.
Last September E. M. Haven cf South
Haven, Mich., decided that thl3 locality
offers better inducements than the
other parts of the State with which he
is familiar. In Michigan Mr. Haven
conducted a large business, farming
from fouÂ» to six hundred acres each
year and he desires to engage In the
business in this county on equally as
large a scale. The operations will ba
confined to the vicinity of Arroyo
Grande for the present year.
OTHER OPERATIONS.
While on a visit to California for hia
health Mr. Routzahn became interested
in the business of McClure. His inter
est became deeper and h^la visit was
protracted until he became a resident
of the county. A company was organ
ized and the business was extended to
much larger proportions. Every year
the acreage planted to seed crops baa
been increased until now several hun
dred acres a~e In cultivation, gtvintc
employment to many men and children.
The company Is said to have farmed
more land in 1903 than any other seed
firm in the Stat- with one possible ex
ception. It has grown more salsify
seed during the past few years than
any other seed farm in the ij United
States, and it is also the largest pro
ducer of nasturtium seed. Much at
tention is also given to the cultivation
of sweet peas and every year a larger
area is sown. The sweet pea fields of
the Arroyo Grande Valley are show
places of the county.
It has been the custom of Mr. Rout
zahn for many years to donate to the
ladies of the churches* of Arroyo
Grande millions of sweet pea blossoms,
and In June of each year the ArToyo
Grande Sweet Pea Fair 13 held. Thl3
event alternates among the sects rep
resented In Arroyo Grande. Annually
the interest increases and practically
the whole population of this section at
tend. Its fame is bound to attract vis
itors from distant places.
DEMAND EXCEEDS SUPPLY.
Among the industries that are firmly
established In San Luis Obispo County
that of seed growing Is taking a most
important place. The soil and climatic
conditions prevailing in this county
seem wonderfully well adapted to the
production of all kinds of flower and
garden seeds and the business has al
ready assumed important proportions.
This is due not alc-ne to the wonderful
producing qualities of the soil, but the
invigorating fogs which come In from
the ocean are Important factors in the
success of this Industry.
About ten years ago the advantages
offered by portions of thi3 county were
grasped by E. W. Steele, one of the
pioneers and large land owners of the
county, who began experimenting in
this direction in the Arroyo Grande
Valley In collaboration with T. II. Mc-
Clure. The first experiment was a suc
cess beyond the expectations of the ex
perimenters, though the first crop, ow
ing to the small area planted, sold for
only $1500. The following year seeds to
the value of $3500 were raised. The
gentlemen named were in the decline
of life and it was left to L. C. Rout
zahn. a rc:i-ln-law of McClure, to de
velop the Industry In this county^*

J. Jensen, the managing owner of the bark
entlne Georgina. gave a dinner party on board
yesterday to a number of his friends. The
entertainment was enlivened by fine music,
both vocal and Instrumental. The vessel is
lying alongside Howard .lock No. 1. During
the festivities two of the sailors. Oscar Peter
son and Gus Houstrom.* who had been on
shore partaking of water-front boo*e. came
on board in a great state of hilarity and
wanted to take possession of the ship.. For a
time they held full sway and threatened to
"do up" everything and everybody In sight.
The arrival of officers In the police patrol
wagon served to quiet things down and the
two belligerents, after some difficulty, were
landed in the harbor police station.

The Toyo Klsen Kaisha's steamer Nippon
Maru' Captain W. Woodus Greene, arrived In
port yesterday morning on schedule time. Sha
was 26 days and S hours from Hongkong. 18
days and 7 hours from Yokohama and 3 days
and 18 hours from Honolulu. The voyage waÂ»
practically uneventful.
She brought 3000 tons of freight, consisting
principally of matting rice, silks and curios.
Â¦ Following is the list of passengers from
Yokohama: Miss M. E. Beaumont. Captain

The China Commercial Company's steamer
Ching Wo. Captain Parkinson, arrived in port
yesterday and came to her dock late in the
afternoon. She was â¢ Â« â¢ daTS *nd 11
hours from Hongkong. 30 days and 2rt
hours from Yokohama and 5 days ana
15 hours from Manzanlllo. Captain Parkin
son reports that on November 27. . when In
longitude 37 north and latitude 174 west she
ran into a terrific northerly gale and for
thirty-six hours had a great battle with, the
sea The waves rolled mountains high and
the decks were simply a mass of seething
billows. Everything movable was washed
away Including one of the ship's boats and
her gangplank The small bulwarks on the
port side were smashed in. the bulwarks over
the fiddler were damaged and. in the midst
of the. fury of the etorm. the steering gear
broke The big steamer was tossed about. like
a cockle shell. One great sea struck her with
unusual violence and knocked down one of
the Chinese crew, breaking his Jaw and
knocking out five of his teeth. To add to the
general confu3lon the vessel's engines became
temporarily disabled, and but for the fine
seamanship of the commander and hi* crew
the craft would have undoubtedly gone to
Davy Jones' lacker.
- As a sort of climax to this rough experience
of the voyage. Chief Officer Hawsen had the
misfortune to break the small" bones In his
right heel when the steamer was docking here
yesterday The vessel had Just been made
fast to the wharf when Hawsen started to
come ashore to give orders* about adjusting
some of the cables. The gangplank having
been washed away during the storm. Hawson's
only means of getting on the dock was to
climb over the ship's railing and make a Jump
to the dock, a distance of about twelve feet.
He Jumped and struck the wharf with great
force breaking the small bones In WÂ« rlghj
foot. AVlth difficulty he waa hauled back on
board the ship and carried to his cabin. The
ship's surgeon stated that the Injury was
very serious and that It would be a long time
before Hawsen would have the use of Ills foot.
The steamer took 16S Chinese to ManzanUlo
and orought 1300 tons of freight to this port.
Chins Wo Encounters Gale.
The Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company's steamer Oanfa arrived
yesterday^ 96 days from Glasgow, 39
days from Hongkong and 16 days from
Mororan. She is'^the biggest" English
vessel that ever entered f this harbor.
She came alongside the Pacific
dock just as the tide commenced to
ebb and under command of Pilot James
Miller slid into her berth in the easiest
manner possible*. Her docking was one
of the finest pieces of seamanship that
has been seen in this port for many a
day and was done in a limited space
owing to a number of ships and barges
moored in proximity to her docking
place. Captain Thomas Bartlett, her
commander, is very proud of his vessel
and he has cause to be. It is her second
voyage and her first trip to this port.
She was built in Glasgow in 1903. She
is 498 feet long, 58 feet 3 inches beam
and draws 33 feet. She is registered at
18,000 tons measurement and will carry
11,300 tons weight. She has twin screws,
triple expansion engines, electric lights
and all modern improvements and is
first class in every possible respect.
She carries a complement of 89 men
all told, which includes 37 firemen and
7 engineers.
She brought 7000 tons of merchandise
for this port, principally of
30,000 rolls of matting. She has on
board 149 Chinese, bound for Victoria,
for which port she will probably sail on
Wednesday.
Captain Bartlett reports that shortly
after the ship left Hongkong three Jap
anese stowaways were discovered and
when the steamer arrived at Mororan
they were put ashore. Soon after the
vessel left Mororan the same three
stowaways were discovered on board
again. They were In the bins, almost
covered up with coals. How they got
on board a second time and managed
to keep hidden from sight is a mystery
that the captain and officers cannot ex
plain.

Dr. Alexander J. Mclvor-Tyndall gave
the last of his series of public lectures
on psychic science at Steinway Hall
last evening to a very large audience.
The feature of the evening was the ex
planation and reproduction of the feats
of "the Georgia Magnet." Dr. Mclvor-
Tyndall said that he did not as a rule
attempt to explain any phenomena that
were presented on a purely amusement
basis, but that he made an exception in
this case because there is a general
opinion that the phenomena presented
by Miss Abbott are either fraudulent or
supernatural. As neither hypothesis
was correct, he decided to answer the
many inquiries in regard to it by dem
onstrating the truth of his explanation.
Most of the feats produced by "the
Georgia Magnet" were given and the
method of their accomplishment scien
tifically explained on the law of the pa
rallelogram of forces. Many interest
ing and entertaining experiments in the
power" of thought were also made, Dr.
Mclvor-Tyndall again explaining that
the power he demonstrates so marvel
ously Is a perfectly natural one. The
famous teacher of psychic science ex
pects to leave shortly for Los Angeles
to fill engagements there.
Dr. TyndaU's Lecture.
The statement made in court by At
torney George A. Knight to the effect
that certain evidence in the Botkin
murder case had passed from the Juris
diction of the court proves to be with
out foundation. The exemplars, exhib
its and every document appertaining to
the case which appeared in evidence at
the original trial were all placed in
charge of Oscar Tolle, the deputy clerk
of the court at that time, and by him
locked up in the vault in the former
court rooms of Judge Carroll Cook,
which rooms are now used by the Hast
ings Law College. The documents have
always remained there and have never
been disturbed* until yesterday, when
Tolle, under an order from Judge Cook,
proceeded to the vault and there found
everything intact and in the same con
dition as when originally put there.
The prescription book belonging to
the Owl Drug Store was returned to
that company after the trial was con
cluded and a receipt was given to De
tective Lees for the same at that time,
which receipt is in possession of the ex
ecutors of the late detective. The can
dies that were alleged to have melted
and dissolved were found to be in fine
condition.
The new trial of Mrs. Botkin has
been set for February 15. â¢ -

TffilSTMAS SERVICES AT
EMMANUEL BAPTIST CHURCH
The firemen's quartet rendered sev
eral pleasing selections and were heart
ily encored three times. Miss Nellie R.
Waters, daughter of the battalion chief
of the department, rendered several airs
on the musical snowbells before the
fire scenes took place.
The first performance in aid of the
widows' and orphans' fund of the Fire
Department took place at the Grand
Opera-house yesterday afternoon. Not
withstanding the threatening weather,
a good house turned out to witness the
production, "A Little Outcast." one of
those stirring melodramas that always
appeals to the heart of the gallery god.
The audience seemed to like the show
and applauded each thrilling scene, but
as soon as the fire laddies made their
appearance' on the stage after the fall
of the curtain the real cheering com
menced. It was a scene from real life
and there was nothing lacking to make
it excitingly realistic.
The first scene shows the interior of
a firehouse. Harry Hook, the popular
policeman, strolls leisurely in and
passes a few remarks with the fire
captain. Suddenly tne fire alarm is
turned in and then the real activity
commences. The fire fighters jump out
of their beds above the stage and slide
down the ladders. The horses are
hitched to the hose wagon in waiting
and the vehicle dashes off the stage at
a furious pace.
The next scene represents the fire. A
crowd of a hundred men, women and
children dash across the stage, fol
lowed by the policemen, who promptly
round them all up and rope "off the dan
gerous places. Then the engines ar
rive and the work of rescue and fire
fighting is inaugurated.
The firemen adjust the. ladders in a
twinkling and climb up to. the second
story, where the inmates of the burn-i
ing building are waiting to be rescued.
Some are packed down on the backs of
the stalwart firemen, others jump into
the waiting net and then the flames are
extinguished, amid the cheering of. the
crowd.
"The more I eee of men the better I
like dogs."
The Orpheum Road Show rather re
minds of this amiable epigram. The
dogs have it on the bill. Merian's dogs.
Not that good people are lacking, but
the dog's the thing.
Last week a horse set one to wonder
ing as to the difference between "horse
sense" and ours; this week a French
poodle propounds new problems as to
instinct and reason. Mr. Monissey -will
probably find a donkey next week to
convince that it is no great thing, after
all, to be a man. Meantime, Merian's
dogs are good enough. They are the
cleverest, funniest troupe ever Been
here, their act the oddest. The French
poodle. Caesar, does mind reading very
cleverly, and then comes the rest of the
company In a melodrama, "The Faith
less Woman." This is a drama played
entirely by the dogs. It Is In two acts,
and with a luminous plot- The lead
ing canine is Bobby, who, as a wronged
husband, Pratzenbauer, scored a great
hit Hamele, his fair but frail partner,
was impersonated by Fldo with great
emotional power. Sepo, the Don Juan
of the cast, was brilliantly essayed by
Filas. who managed to keep on his hind
legs throughout the performance. The
company was handsomely costumed
and wore shoes, and from the time the
gay Lothario meets the village beauty,
to where he is carried off barking from
her paws by the police dog, there
wasn't a hitch. The scenery, charming,
is by Frohdog.
Almost as clever as the dogs are E.
F. Reynard's mechanical â¢ figures, with
Reynard's wonderful ventriloquism be
hind them. Mr. Reynard is a whole vil
lage in himself and has provided some
excellent fun with his ventriloquial
marvels. He, too, is what the press
agents are fond of calling a "top notch
er." Those delightful troubadours, the
Melani trio, are always favorites, and
this year have a delightful turn, sing
ing, strumming and fiddling their way
victoriously to their audience's heart.
Elizabeth Murray brings some new
Irish stories, witty and as wittily told
as usual, and rivals Ernest Hogan him
self in her coon songs. Ernest Hogan's
sketch, "A Missionary Man." is not the
best the "unbleached American" has
been seen in. It somehow just falls to
"get there." Hogan himself is in fine
slnging.form, has good songs and has a
useful assistant in Miss Mattie "Wilkes.
The juggling actâ and what would a
road show be without a juggler?â is ex
cellent. The juggler is Henri Hiimber-.
ty, and his turn is both clever and
novel. For the rest Albertus and Mil
lar throw Indian clubs at each other in
fascinating fashion when they are not
playing the cornet; the four NIghtons
are virtuosi of the rings and trapeze.
Fred Eckhoff and Anna Gordon, who
complete the bill, have evidently wan
dered in from a "supper show."
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
One of the ancient customs of pre
senting each child with a bag of sweet
meats was duly. observed and prizes in
addition were awarded for efficiency "in
the religious classes.
AfCongregation Keneseth Israel and
at the Free Religious School,' Folsom
street, the children were ' bountifully
feasted.
The Rev. Dr. Nleto presided at the
festival exercises at Congregation
Sherith Israel and the children con
ducted the services. Miss Sadie Green
read the chapter of the book of Macca
bcec which recounts the incident of the
re\olt and rededication of the temple
and Louis Young recited from memory
the one hundred and twenty-fourth
Psalm.
Congregation Beth Israel was crowd
ed in the evening and the programme
was especially appropriate to the festal
occasion.
The origin of the feast of Chanukah
dates from the year 3622 (according to
the Jewish calendar), when Judan, the
son of Mattathias, routed the Syrian
army. Judah then regained possession
of the temple, which for many years
had been lost to the Jews. Then came
the purifying and rededication of the
sacred edifice wherein worship was re
sumed on the 25th day of Kislev in the
year 3C22. Rejoicing over the signal
victory has ever been observed from
that date, 2042 years ago, by the Jew
ish race.
The festivities in the afternoon at the
Bush-street synagogue, at the Jewish
Educational Society's Free- Religious
School and at the handsome new syna
gogue, Congregation Keneseth Israel,
on Russ street, were marked with un
usual enthusiasm on the part of the
children. Rabbis and officials were
present at each place of worship where
in the celebration was being observed.
At the Bush-street Synagogue Rabbi
Isidore Myers prepared a sacred pro
gramme of rejoicing, in which the chil
dren conducted the entire service in
Hebrew and English. Cantor" M. Salo
non, aided by the choir, rendered an
cient melodies centuries old.
Many hundreds of them attended the
synagogues during the afternoon and
evening and the services were left to
them to conduct. The children per
formed sacred office in each instance
with remarkable force, reading or* re
citing the lessons both in Hebrew and
English and singing beautiful hymns of
Joy.
The seventh day of, the feast of Cha
nukah, or festival of lights, was -cele
brated yesterday by the children of the
Jewish community. . Â¦
