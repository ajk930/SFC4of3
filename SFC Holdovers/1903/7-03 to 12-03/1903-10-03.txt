LONDON, Oct.. 2.â A dispatch to the Chronicle from Viepna
quotes reservedly, believing that it is grossly exaggerated, a
report published in a local paper at Charnovitz that a mas
sacre of Jews was perpetrated at Mohileff, near Kishenev, on
Thursday. :..:.: " ' :
On Wednesday the rabbi at Mohileff warned the Jews not to
go to' the synagogue' on the following day, which was "recon
ciliation day," as a mob, including the neighboring peasantry, in
tended to assault the synagogue. He advised 'vthe Jews to arm
themselves, which they did.
Bands entered the town on Thursday, says the paper, and
assailed the Jews, who resisted. The massacre lasted all : day.
Three hundred Jews and 100 Christians were killed. . .The popu
lation of 'Mohileff is 50,000, 25,000 of whom are Jews.
The Berlin correspondent of the Daily Express sends a simi

came a sanguinary fight, which was waged with the greatest fury.

HARMONY AT MEETING.
Thereupon Sir John E. Dorington's offi
cial resolution of yesterday was carried
unanimously, Sir John Gorst saying in
behalf of this Free Fooders; that they did
not desire any more amendments..
In withdrawing tht â¢'rider." which
promised to. further disrupt the ranks of
the Unionists, Mr. Chaplin explained that
he was convinced, after hearing Mr. Bal
four's speech of last, night,- that It would
be mischievous to press the matter, as It
â¢was directly hostile.^ io the Premier and
nothing was further. 1 from his views. 1
Lord Hugh Cecil, M. P., and Winston
Churchill, M. P., subsequently announced
that they had neither voted for .nor
against the Dorington resolution. After
'the passage of a resolution urging the
Government to take steps to Insure the
efficiency of the administration the con
ference terminated.
PRAISE FOR CHAMBERLAIN.
Mr. Balfour went on to say that recent
events had not substantially divided the
party, but they had divided the Govern
ment and the parting of old friends had
been accompanied by reyret Beth those
who went and those who stayed were de
voted to the Unionist party, the Govern
ment and the empire. They had lost the
greatest. Colonial Minister tho country
had ever seen. His services could not be
exaggerated. He had to leave Mr. Cham
berlain to express his own views, which
did not differ a hair's breadth from his
(Balfour's).
Although Lord Mllner had declined the
Colonial Secretaryship, Mr. Balfour add
ed, he was in entire agreement with
the Government on its Imperial domestic
policy. Mr. Balfour further remarked
that he had failed to convince Lord Mll
ner that he could better deal with the
delicate South African questions in Down-
Ing street than on the spot. -
Asked to elucidate certain points la his
speech of to-day Mr. Balfour told a re
porter that the statement that Mr. Cham
berlain's opinion did not differ from his
own did not refer to the fiscal problem,
but merely to the reasons which Induced
Mr. Chamberlain to resign. He admitted
that he and Mr. Chamberlain were agreed
In principle of the fiscal problem and
added: '

"Mr. , Chamberlain recognizes that the
country Is not yet prepared to discuss the
taxation ot food, but he tells me that
he Is bound with the colonies and will
therefore act as a missionary &9 regards

LONDON, Oct. 2.â Baron Hayashi, the
Japanese Minister here, has no news of
the movements of Japanese troops to Ko
rea, announced from Paris yesterday. In
an interview to-day the Minister said:
"From the published accounts I am cer
tain that any movements of troops ; are
only the routine relief of the Japanese
forces guarding the telegraph line from
Fusan to Seoul and Chemulpo. To send a
small body of troops to Korea would be
no menace to Russia and would have no
effect on her plans. A mobilization of
the Japanese forces on a large scale is
not contemplated for a moment, and Ko
rea's consent would have to be obtained
for any such step."
The Minister added that he still believed
Russia intended to keep her promiso to
evacuate Manchuria October 8. Until that
promise was broken Japan was not likely
to make any move. The Japanese troops
guarding the telegraph lines were sta
tioned in Korea with the assent of Rus
sia, as well as Korea.
W. Prltchard Morgan, Consut General
of Korea in London, also has no informa
tion on the subject. He suggested, how
ever, that the time was coming when the
powers should agree to Korea being de
clared an independent neutral State like
Belgium. ; '?'":-; ! *> ; ?"V>;^^

Mehomia is an important town and

population was, about equally divided
between Turks and Bulgarians. The
latter numbered 3200 persons.
According to the fugitives. - when the
general rising was declared in the Razr

troops in the Perin Mountains hurried
to Mehomia and surrounded the town,
rendering the, escape of the Christians
impossible.,. ;: ._Â£Â£, ,./
The. Bulgarian people were prepared
to join in the rising, several insurgents'
agents being in the Bulgarian quarter
of the town at the time. Desperate
fighting occurred in the streets, bombs
and dynamite being freely used. . After
fighting for five or six hours the Turks
gained the upper hand and proceeded
to massacre every Bulgarian they en
countered.
LONDON, Oct. 2.â With the excep
tion of the revolutionary report of the
massacres at Mehomia. which is iden
tical with the town of Razlosr. there is
little news from the Balkans.
The semi-official Journal de St. Pe
tersbourg, commenting on the visit of
the Czar to Emperor Francis Joseph,
declares that the firm languaee em
ployed by the representatives of the
Russian and Austrian Governments at
Constantinople and Sofia has averted
war for the present.
A dispatch from Constantinople says
the Anatolian troops recently called out
are merely intended to displace" the un
ruly troops who are responsible for the
excesses, so the actual effectiveness of
the army in Roumelia will not thereby
be increased.
The Macedonian revolutionary head

information that the whole Christian
population of the town of Mehomia
(Razlog), ~ province of Seres, were
massacred September 28.with the excep

suicide in order to avoid capture.
A report from the insurgent head
quarters asserts that 6060 Turks were
routed by 2000 insurgents in the Perin

The Turkish losses in this affair are
said to have been, the heaviest during

lost a small open face watch with the
monogram "M. J. B." on It. Whether the
watch had been stolen or mislaid Dr.
Bearby was unable to say. Chief Car
roll took a description of the watch and
then detailed Detectives Prindevllle and
Pickering on the case. A few minutes
after the detectives left Chief Carroll had
occasion to open a small drawer in his
desk, and to his surprise found the watch
there. No one had been at the desk but
Chief Carroll, and he had not been out
of his seat after Dr. Bearby reported the
loss. Dr. Bearby was sent for and iden
tified the watch as her property. No one
knows how the watch got In the Chief's
desk and the entire office force Is in a
dazed condition trying to account for the
strange occurrence. The owner of tho
watch is also puzzled, as she told no one
of the loss of her timepiece and had only
missed it a few minutes before she re
ported its loss to the police.

this action cannot do legally taken,
Messrs. Grout and Fornes will appeal to
the courts for an order that their names

that they cannot be revived by the acts
of committees, such as :s proposed. The

PORTLAND, Or., Oct. 2.â All day yes
terday the big German ship Nauarchos
lay grounded on the bar at the. mouth of
the Willamette River. With three steam
boats hooked to her she was finally moved
from her precarious position, and left for
the sea again this morning in tow of the
Ocklahama. As no pilot was aboard it is
generally believed on the water front that
she will experience more trouble before
the Columbia bar is reached.
Captain Arfmand, master of the vessel,
stated before leaving here that It was an
unnecessary expense to employ a pilot to
accompany him, but it is very probable
that he has now changed his mind. The
vessel is wheat-laden, but she was only
drawing 22V5 feet of water. A day pre^
ceding her the steamship Indrapura sailed
for tl\e mouth of the river drawing *.wen
ty-three feet, and she experienced no
trouble with bars or anything else. That
is cited as an argument by shipping men
why the Nauarchos should have got along
without getting stuck on the river bot
tom. If the current Is followed, they
state that there is plenty of water to an
swer all requirements, but in order to
keep In the proper course It Is averred an
experienced man must be at the helm.
She Is , Finally Byemoved . From Her
Dangerous Position by Three
Steamboats.

". SAN DIEGO. Oct. 2. -^County Superin
tendent Baldwin has "rendered a decision
that is lively to cut short the sehool year
at'ifce "San T>ioW High School. Prior to
flie recent" clec'tkm the high- school was
ac.eQUTM>d' a part- of the public school,. a
sort of adjunct fotheiimth grade. It was
not properly organized as a high school
crnd could -.not participate in the distri
bution'of â¢ The State, tax for "high 'school
purposes. . The election -was therefore held
to rorrect that trouble and a high school
district, was-'formed. This took it out- of
the; =public district .school and out of a
tight* to participate" in the funds raised
by ' the cit,v board. At Hie same - time
tJTero. was iro opportunity lor the . high
s.&hool bonrd- to plas for a special high
school "tax. and- none was 'levied. The high
sc"h6ol therefore must subsist on th.e funds
furnished :tfom the State. There will not
be enough money to last the- full school
year.. â¢
irent- .of the hearing of her case, Mrs.
Butler and her sister returned to the Pal
ace arid in the evening they departed for
Monterey. Millionafre Barber left the
Grand "Hotel about the same time, saying
that lie would bo back in a few days.
Mrs/ Butler's maid' confided to a newly
made acquaintance that her mistress twas
preparing for a trip to Mexico and would
return home by way of New Orleans.
â¢ Two years. ago this month Mrs. Butler
gained considerable notorieiy in New
York City in an attempt to" "commit sui
cide. ; &'y jumping, out of a window in the
Sturtevant Hotel, where she was residing.
She is widely known ia the big Eastern

WASHINGTON, Oct. 2.-MaJor General
Corbin, adjutant general of the army, is
to be assigned to the command of the De
partment of the East, with headquarters
at Governors Island, N. Y.
I The order for General Corbin to as
sume command of this department will
take effect at once and it states that he
is given . command of the largest depart
ment in the United States in recognition
of his services as adjutant general during
the Spanish war and the Chinese and
Philippine campaigns.
An order has been prepared in the War
Department directing General Chaffee,
now commanding the Department of the
East, to take station in the War Depart
ment for the purpose of familiarizing him
self with the duties of the chief of staff,
which he will become when General
Young retires In January.
In explanation of the transfer of these
two officers. General S. B. M. Young,
chief of staff, to-day Issued the follow
ing statement: â¢
"With a view to enable- Major General
Chaffee to become familiar with the duties
vested by law in the chief of staff and
to ascertain the present condition of the
military establishment, before entering
upon their active performance, the Presi
dent has directed that he be ordered to
duty In the War Department as assistant
to the chief of staff, and that Major Gen
eral Corbin be assigned to command the
Department of the East. .
"This assignment; which is in accordance
with the wishes of General Corbin, is in
tended as a recognition of the eminent
services rendered by him in the Important
office of adjutant general during the wax
with Spain and the subsequent- operations
in China and the Philippines, and is made
with a view to obtaining the benefit of
his- great administrative and .executive
ability in the command- of .the - largest
and most important military department
in the United States. Advantage will bo
taken of the assignment to secure the
close, harmonious and intelligent co
opeTatlon of officers and troop3 in. carry-
Ing into effect the new methods, of ad
ministration which have been made neces
sary by the establishment of a general
staff."
UERDlS'G, Oct. 2.â Plans are being
â¢formuiated .* to divid'e S.isklyou County
: into two' -almost equal liarts. The divid
ing; line is" to extend north and south from
a point just east of Colos, on the- Oregon
;lin'e, to a point edst of the corner of Shas
ta and Trinity counties. -The proposed
division will leave Vrelca, Montague, Scott
and Shasta .'valleys !n Slskiyou County,
while Sisson, McClou'd, Mott,. Bunsmulr
and- Shasta and the big lumbering camps
â¢and timber-lands will be 'In the newly
Â¦formed county. Â»
: "The result of an. election on the division
questfon is easy of conjecture. Dunsmuir
â¢alone polls as many votes as Yreka. The
Sisson ajid McCfoud regions poll, many
mnrÂ«, and it is estimated that the propo
sition would carry by much more than a
â¢three-fourths vote. In case the-county is
tfivided Sisson will make a strong fight
for the county seat. There always has
been a sort .of jealousy, nnd hard feeling
betwe'en .Yreka. on the north and Sisson
and Dunsmuir on the south, and this, tb
pether with -the fact that the interests of
Iviftern Siskiyou and Western Siskiyou
.are in- no way identical, leads the citizens
of EÂ»tstern Siskiyou" to move, for a divi
sion.. If .the proposed division of the
county is carried through the new county
will undoubtedly be called McCloud.

To uphold law and order should be the first
duty of every American cltisen. In many eec
tions of the country there Is a disregard of
law which Is bringing discredit to the nation.
AH parties should Insist that public officials
should be firm and resolute in the enforcement
of law, regardless of personal or political con-
Sf-quence*. In thiÂ« land, dedicated to liberty
and freedom, the rule of the mob should be
suppressed.
The Republican party favors legislation that

We reaffirm our belief In the policy of pro
tection to American Industries. While admit
ting that tariff schedules should be revised
from time to time to meet changing Industrial
conditions or to secure the benefits which may
be obtained by reciprocity, we declare that the
present tariff law should not be revised or
changed until the need of such action and the
benefits to be obtained from It are clearly
shown. Whenever Industrial conditions shall
require a readjustment of the tariff, the work
will be undertaken by the "Republican party,
the friend and defender of protection, without
unnecessary disturbance to business or com
merce, and with fairness and Justice to all
American Interests.
An able, honest, fearless chief executive, we
plodjre to him our loyal support for the cam

of the Sixth .Infantry, located at Merced,
be mustered out. He also recommends
that the commanding officers of Company
B of Stockton, Company D of Mod<<fto
and Company F of Fresno, all of the
Sixth Infantry, bcÂ« notified that their re
spective commands will be inspected with
in the next six months, with a view to
the mustering out of these companies if
their efficiency is not greatly increased.
He also recommends that Company H,
Seventh Infantry, located at Talbert,
Orange County, be mustered out, if its
efficiency cannot be increased and main
tained. The report also criticizes the
companies of the First Infantry, located
In San Francisco, the inspector declaring
that scarcely one of the members was
able to answer the simplest question per
taining to guard duty. He discovered a
lack of discipline in Troop A, Cavalry,
of San Francisco. He gives a compara
tively favorable report with reference to
the Second Brigade, Signal Corps, and
the First Battalion of Artillery, both of
San Francisco.
In an interview with The CaJl corre
spondent to-night Colonel H. I. Seymour
of the Second Regiment said that while
he did not desire to criticize Colonel Kos
ter's.report, he nevertheless believed the
time an inspecting officer takes to a com
pany is Insufficient to enable the inspector
to judge of the true standing of the com
pany. He said an injustice would be done
both to the boards of organization and
location if the two companies In his regi
ment were mustered out. Colonel Sey
mour said many recruits had been en
rolled at the time Colonel Koster made
his Inspection and they were necessarily
green, but the companies were now up
to their former standard.

PEACE and good will hovered over

' cratic â¢ County Committee fast
-.evening. -"-The members -that con
stitute the committee gathered .In
Portola Hali-. Native Sojis* ; building, and
transacted their business "lii an orderly'
and business-like manner. The scene's
that enliv.ehed the municipal convention
were missing. Gavin McNab was present
.to lend eclat* to: the meeting. He sat in
a corner with a benign smile on his coun
tenance and was ready to give advice if
it was needed. Many of the delegates wore
Lane buttons. The' standard-bearer's
name was not mentioned once and ttiere
was no enthusiasm, whatever durlm? the
meeting. ...
Thomas "W. Hlckey, chairman of the
late convention, called the meeting to or
der In the absence of Jasper McDonald,
who remained away, fearing that . the
minority might â¢ not permit him to even
open the session. The roll call Â¦ developed
that eighty-one were present. The first
business \yas"the erection of a president
of the body and Joseph E. O'Donnell arcise
and named Hickey. Mr. O'Donnell said:
"In view of the fair and impartial man
ner in Â¦which the chairman of our con
vention- presided over it, and "beingr im
pressed with the fact, as no doubt you all
are, that his offices over this committee
will be fulfilled In the same fair and im
partial manner, I with pleasure -express
myself as favorable to the election of Mr.
Hlckey as chairman of this committee."
The nomination of Mr. Hlckey was sec
onded by nearly every delegation present-
He was elected by acclamation and then
expressed his gratitude for the honor con
ferred upon hjm. Hickey took occasion to
say that there was no 'longer a majority
or a minority to' the party, but that the
Democrats were united and were out
working to elect the entire. ticket.
Thomas E. Curran nominated Walter J.
de â¢ Martini for" secretary and the last
named was selected for the position. In
expressing his -thanks for. the honor" De
Martini apologized for the fact that He
was no orator and that the delegates
would therefore not care to hear from
him. He then, delivered quite a lengthy
speech, in which he expressed his grati
fication half a dozen times. . â¢:
Despite his objections, Joseph jSlye.was
elected treasurer. Although the office is
an honorary one, an effort was made to
put Mr. Slye under. bonds, but he Inter
posed strenuous objections.
Colonel Herbert Choynskl was conspicu
ous in. the meeting.: His motion to have
a campaign committee of. eighteen' ap
pointed prevailed. JV. A. Kelly moved as
an amendment that seven be" appointed,
but after a lengthy discussion the amend
ment was .withdrawn and the original mo
tion was carried.
A committee pf three was appointed
to examine the constitution and by-laws
of the previous County ' Committee and
report back whether -they needed amend
ment. Chairman Hickey was empowered
to appoint committees on finance, . regis
tration and resolutions. An adjournment
was taken to the call of the chair.

As a corollary to that principle, I am op
posed to the intar'-'entlon of government in any
class of enterprises which are In conflict with
and opposition to private undertakings.
I am a firm believer in tne Idea that all en
terprises not within the most strictly defined
powers of government should be left to pri
vate investors and to the Initiative of individ
uals: that the public treasury should net bt*
drawn upon nor taxation levied to establish
works of general utility In opposition ta the
Investment*- of private citizens.
I am unwilling, even by silenc.'. to obtain
the vote of any elector acting in Ignorance ot
my declared opinion.
If I should be elected It would be my Outy
to carry into effect, by my professional labors,
the mandate of the people of this city in the
acquisition of the Geary-street railroad and
such other public utilities as they in iheir
wiadom micht choose to acquire.
My opinions upon this subject are unchang
able. For this reason, reiterating my warmest
thanks for the honor you have conferred upon
me, I have the honor to d--c!lnjÂ» the nomina
tion. I remain. Yours very sincerely.
CRITTEXDEX THORNTON.
I have read the platform and dec
laration of principles of the-conven
tion and regret that there is one sub
ject of municipal policy upon which
I am not in accord with the opinions
of the convention.
I refer to the plank in the plat
form which favors the acquisition of
the Geary-street railroad and its op
eration by and at the cost of the mu
nicipal government.
I have not only formed this
opinion, but have expressed the same
on record to the effect that such a
purpose is not only contrary to the
fundamental principles, of Democracy,
but is forbidden by the present con
stitution of the State of California.
Hincc I have te*>r. old enough to form and
express opinions of public policy I have be
lieved in the declaration of Thomas Jefferson
that "the best government 13 that which gov

Dear- Sir: At a meeting of the advisory
council of the league with the Republican
nominees held last evening a moflon was unani
mously carried that meetings be called for as
early a date as possible of the executive com
mittees of all district clubs to which the mem
bers of the county committee from the district
be invited for lhe purpose of taking active
iÂ«teps to thoroughly organize every district and
precinct and enlist the co-operation of all Re
publicans in support of the ticket.
Kindly Â»end word to these headquarters of
the time and place you will call the meeting
which is to be held In your district Re
spectfully, J. STEPPACHER, Secretary-
Secretary of State Charles F. Curry,
who is in the city looking over the politi
cal situation, predicts a sweeping Repub
lican victory. He cannot see why the
city of San Francisco should turn a col-d
shoulder on the party of progress and
prosperity. Comparing the present flour
ishing times under National and State
Republican administrations with the hard
and dull times when the Democrats were
In office he cannot believe that the labor
ing men, the merchants and property
owners are going to place themselves in
the condition that existed when thousands
of honest and industrious men were will
ing to accept a day's work on a pub.lic
boulevard at $1 a day and when one-third
of the dwellings were vacant.
A communication of which the follow
ing is a copy has been sent to the presi
dent of every .district club of the league:
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 2, 1903.
DISTRICT ORGANIZATION.
There is a general" expression. through
out the city that the Republicans this
year will vote the straight ticket. There
are indications that the efficient organi
zation of the party in every Assembly
district will bring to the polls on election
day nearly every registered voter- of Re
publican tendencies. The organization
committee, of the United Republican
League met last evening at 16 Geary
street. Another meeting will be held at
4 p. m. to-day.
The Republicans of San Francisco never
before entered upon a local campaign
with greater confidence of a successful
finish than Is now shown. \ Politicians
who have carefully studied the existing
conditions, and taken Into consideration
the Republican strength, displayed in the
city election two years ago and. in the
State election last year predict that the
party vote next month will approximate
25,000. .
assurance 'of vigorous support.
The gratifying intelligence is also received
that many prominent workingmen who
supported the labor nominee In 1901 will
lend their influence in this campaign to
the party of progress and prosperity.
There was an animated and prolonged
session of Henry J. Crocker's campaign
committee last night. Plans for a vigor
ous and determined contest were disi
cussed. The leaders were elated over the
prospects of success. Arrangements were
effected for a large meeting of business
men next Monday evening. During the
last week the committee acquired a vast
deal of information concerning the atti
tude of leading men in mercantile, manu
facturing and professional pursuits. Re
ports from every district of the city were
submitted to the "campaign committee.
Many firms and institutions that were in
different or apathetic' in the contest two
years ago promise to take an active part
in t promoting the election of Mr. Crocker
and his associates on the Republican
ticket. These positive assurances of en
thusiastic support impel the leaders to
broaden the scope of operations by en
larging the membership of the committee.

SACRAMENTO, [ Oct. 2. â Edward
Skuggs, whose home Is in Atlanta, Geor
gia, has been confined In the County Jail
for several days on suspicion of insanity,
but as he is apparently fully restored to
competency he will be released. Skuggs
inherited $15,000 from his father's estate
in Atlanta nine months ago, and pro
ceeded to put the money in circulation.
He journeyed to San Francisco by a cir
cuitous route and all he remembered of
the trip is that he had a good time and
spent $14,800 in securing it. He left San
Francisco with $200 and found himself the
other. day at a gay resort on the Riverside
road, a few miles below Sacramento. The
rural constables arrested him on suspi
cion of Insanity, an evidence of the de
mentia, which they regard as conclusive
being his refusal to take a drink of liquor
when invited to do so. He supplied what
the constables deemed further proof of
a -disordered. mind when he paid 25 cents
for a glass of plain water. Skuggs says
there Is more money coming to him in At
lanta and he is going back to get it.

North' Shore Railroad Company's
New System for Passenger Travel
Is Put in Operation.
SAN RAFAEL, Oct. 2. â The North
Shore Railroad Company , ran its first
electric train into' San Rafael to-night.
Two weeks ago a train was carried over
the track as far as West End station, but
to-night showed the entire system in oper
ation. About BOO San Rafaelites made the
round trip to Sausalito. A train of six
cars left here at 8:10 and arrived at the
terminus at 8:40. On the return the trip
was made from Sausalito to San Rafael
in 21 minutes. The average speed was 35
miles per hour and the maximum speed
about 45 miles an hour. The trip was
entirely successful.
FIRST ELECTRIC TRAIN
RUNS INTO SAN RAFAEL
bruised; Mrs. M. L. Trowbridge, Bridge
port, Conn., severe sprain of back and
lower muscles of abdomen; Miss Mae
McKinley, Kingfisher, Okla., sprained
back; Mrs. J. Norman, Elko, Nev., bruised
over left eye, injured in the breast; Anto
nio Dlgovno, Oakland, injured on hips; T.
E. Mathews, Ogden, Utah, Wells-Fargo
express messenger, cut on head.
Both engines were demolished and the
baggage car, smoker, day coach and sev
eral tourist cars were badly damaged.
The wreckage caught fire, but the flames
were soon extinguished by those of the
persons who had escaped injury. Among
the passengers on the train were a doctor,
a trained nurse and two discharged sol
diers, the latter having served in the hos
pital corps in the Philippine Islands. They
rendered great service to the injured be
fore the arrival of medical assistance
from Winnemucca and Carlin.
Allan Harper was sitting in the rear end
of the smoker when the collision took
place, and was pinned and badly mangled
in the wreckage. Death was not instan
taneous and he suffered untold agony for
several hours.
According to the stories told by the rail
road hands the second section of No. 219
came down the main line at Beowawe to
allow a freight to pull out. Conductor
Dorsey, in charge of No. 219, saw what
the engineer was doing, and as No. 6 was
about due turned the air on the train,
breaking it in two. The brakeman went
back to chain up, while the fireman went
to flag the first section of No. 6, which
was coming. Being on the curve, the
passenger engineer did not see the flag
man until the trains were almost togeth
er and It was impossible to prevent a
collision. Both engine crews Jumped be
fore the trains met.
The dead and injured were taken on the
second section of No. 6 to Ogden, with the
exception of Fireman Stone and Grant
Pyle of San Francisco, *who were trans
ferred to No. 5 and sent to San Fran
cisco.

KANSAS CITT, Mo., Oct. 2 âSamuel
Parks, the New York walking delegate,
won a personal victory over President
Frank Buchanan In the forenoon session
to-day of the International-Association of
Bridge and Structural Iron Workers. It
developed when an amendment to the con
stitution drawn by J. Dugan of Chicago,
a Buchanan adherent, to the effect that
no man holding political ofUce be eligible
to representation at any contention or
to hold an executive office therein, cam 2
up for vote. It was directed at Richard
J. Butler, a member of local No. 2, and
an Assemblyman from. New York City.
President Buchanan left the chair and
spoke for the amendment.
James O'Brien of Pueblo, Clarence
Smart of Chicago and John T. Lee of
Detroit also spoke for the amendment.
Thomas MoGovern of Albany spoke earn
estly against the amendment and then
Sacnuel Parks took the floor to fight it.
Parks aroused the convention U< the high
est pitch of excitement. H$ declared that
the amendment was aJmnd at him, for
It sought to 6u3t his protege. Assembly
man Eutler. It was nothing but another
rlsht by President Buchanan and his
crowd against Union No. 2. Parks then
paid a glowing tribute to Delegate Butler,
asserting that he ha/1 done groat things
for union labor In New York by securing
the passage by the Legislature- of that
State of measures favorable to the or
ganized workingman.
After Parks had taken his rftat It was
rome minutes before President Buchanan
restored order and called for tht vote,
so intense was the demonstration for tha
New Yorker that followed. When the
amendment was declared defeated by a
vote of 15 to 32 Parks was congratulated.
One-third of the delegates did not vote.
This morning the Buchanan men still
claimed 45 votes for Buchanan, while the
Parks element asserted positively that
they had 43 votes pledged for Donnelly.
Forty-two votes are necessary to elect.
Aside from president the only other con
test Is for secretary-treasurer. The Bu
chanan element will .try to elect J. L.
Milton of Pittsburg to succeed J. W.
Johnston of local No. 2 of Nr-w York,
the incumbent, while local No. 1 of Chi
cago will present P. J. Dalton of that
city.
At the afternoooi session a committee
was appointed to draw up a working
agreement between the shop, or inside
num. and the outside men. <
President Buchanan brought up the
question of organization in the South by
suggesting that he believed that some
thing should b<? done in this se-:tion. He
said he believed the time had come to
take some kind of action and he asked :
for expressions on the subject from the
delegates. A long discussion followed, i
Every delegate who spoke was opposed j
to taking ud the matter at this conven- j
tion. arguing against recognition, and the '.
subject was dropped without action being
take.i on it. . j
T!** election was again put off another

Elizabeth Richards, in an answer to a
cross-complaint in divorce filed by Alex
ander O. Richards, nephew of the late
widow of the philanthropist, . Dr. Henry
Cogswell, denies that she ever met her
husband through the medium of an ad
vertisement or that she ever deceived him
into the belief that she was wealthy. She
denies generally every charge Richards
makes and denies specifically his three
charges of infidelity.
. Divorces were granted to Martha Leo
from Harry T. Leo for neglect, John Pet
terson from Pauline Petterson for cruelty,
Moses Frank from Sophie Frank for de-
Judge S'.oss modified the decree of di
vorce he granted some months ago to
Amelia Grannls from James G. Grannls.
The two children, awarded at that tlms
to the custody of Grannis will, until fur
ther order of the court, remain in the
custody of their mother and the father
shall pay 120 a month for their support.
E. Cross against Fr'ank K. Cross for
neglect, Frederick E. McDonnell against
Sarah McDonnell for desertion and Ava
rilla Green against Edward Green for,
neglect. Â»
Anna Astredo, v>ho was -married to An
thony Astredo at Biggs. Butto County,
in September, 1887, is suing-,, him for di
vorce on the^ ground of neglect. She
charges that lor more than a year she
has had to depend upon her own exer
tions for means to provide for herself and
young son. She asks for J50/a month ali
mony out of the $150 she says Astredo
earns: Desertion is charged in the suit
filed by M. A. Gallick against Nicholas
Â£1. Gallick.
Judge Graham partly heard the suit for
the annulment of the marriage of Jennie
Rossini to Fred Cuppers, which took place
last October. The suit is brought by
Frank Rossini, who was married to the
woman several years ago and who now
claims that the Cuppers marriage is il
legal because at the time it was per
formed the woman in the case was of
unsound mind. Â«,
/ Mrs. Seiser says she was married some
' time before the spirits interfered in her
| domestic affairs. She says her husband
: attended a mt'etlng of Spiritualists one
evening and received what purported to
| bo a messasre from the other land. The
j message was to the effect that the wife
; of his bosom 'was receiving the attentions
! of other men. Ho came home, she says,
and accused her of bestowing her affec
tions on others than himself and Informed
' her that her denial of the charge would
j avail her little, because he had been told
[ of her misdeeds by the spirits. .
She says she indignantly denied tHe
truth of the spirit's statement, but her
i denial was treated with contempt by
| Seiser and he thereupon applied to her
sundry epithets, distinctly earthly. She
says the charge so affected her that she
fe.t that to continue longer to live with
I Selser would cause her to become a ner-
: ,vous wreck and therefore she left him
Â¦ and joined her father at Tulare.
In a complaint for divorce filed by Clara
At. Shendan against Matthew P. Sheridan
she charges him with cruelty and makes
the allegation that be once tore a pair of
earrings from her ears, thereby causing
?her great physical agony, as well as in
tense mental suffering. She also
that he has a habit of throwing food and
-dishes at her. She left him twice, she
says, because of^his cruelty, but returned
to him for the sake of their two children
and en the strength of his promise to
treat her decently. â¢ .
Agnes Bokariza wants a divorce Â£rom
Peter Bokariza because of his alleged
cruelty. Shccharges that fros.i May 15,
1902. to August 21 of this year her life
has been made miserable by his bratal
lty. She says he struck and cursed her
several times during that period. -They
were married in August, 1901. . ..-
Suits for divorce were also filed by JCate
Spirits, the etliereal kind, according? to
Alice K. Se!ser, are the cause of her dif
ficulties with her husband. A. B. Selser.
to whom she was married at Fresno in
July, 1901. In a complaint for divorce
filed by her yesterday she says that her
husband is a Spiritualist and therefore a
firm bellevpr in all that purports to come
from, the mysterious places occupied by
the shades of the departed.

'Â¦ Tf jou are a woman don't say that you never heard of her. for just at *
the present time ghe is" o.ne of the most original creators of fashions in \
Vne'a Sam's re^lm.* She \'< the originator of the 'iridescent pearl for hair , 1
Â¦ ornaments 2nd she wears them in quantity that is nothing short of amaz- j
ing. And what think- vou. of the musical jewels? That is another of the |
Gadden Girl's fads. ! Tevels set to dulcet -harmoniesâ a fad in itself suf- |
f ricit to rrake a belje of anv eirl even less remarkable than the Gadden |
Girl, Whijc as for color schemesin^dress^ â However, pictures tell more 1
than f-nrds ever caii. in the descriptfons of feminine raiment at anv rate. |
therefore the. front pas?e of the next Sunday Call will be more eloquent g
than reams on ream* of wt'itine to the women readers. If vou want to H

:And while on the subiect of bright, snappy articles that vou will be ||

Â» corrse you've seen the cats. Everybody, by the way. is talking about Â§Â§
I those cats .and next Sunday's Call contains a perfect love of a kitty. M
I % . . But better than all else for those who want to read the literature that n
J . is most popular to-dav and which will go far toward making up the clas- Â¦
j sic? of the future, there is no limit to the good things. ||
i. ' First there is a short story masterpiece by Jack London, the most H

j Next there is the fascinstinz two-page story by Frank H. Spearman. B
J. "The Kicht Watchman's Storv." Â» If you have read any of this exclusive B
1 seri-s of Spearman's railroad stories you certainly won't miss this. In H
I pofnt of fact when vou see the pictures that illustrate it you won't be able H
| to resist reading it anrwav. . . ||
j. .Then there are two full oaees of "Half-hour Storiettes." the latest If
1 crare in literature. In other words that means eight more of the best H
{J J.Vort stories that are beine written to-day. These alone would cost you n
h anywhere else more than the price cf the entire Sunday Call. 11
Â¦ And this does not include the third installment of the latest book bv H
If . the: farnoui author of "Chimmie Fadden/' It is "Lees and Leaven." Ks

acres of the Old World news are shaking

The great crash of the Eastern giants is to come in
the minds of tlie correspondents.
ITALY, Austria and Russia continue an outpour
ing of their least desirable population as immi
grants to the United States. The prospect is
that the last fiscal year and the present one will add
to our population nearly a million people from those
three countries. The total immigration from all
sources, desirable and undesirable, is too large for the
good of the new comers or of those they find here.
There is a perceptible crowding out of occupation of
our native-born people. There are less than a mil
lion vacancies in our industries to be filled every year
by new hands,, and when we are importing a mil
lion from abroad every j'ear either native or immi
grant must go to the wall. There is evidence that it
is not the immigrant. He comes from the midst of
conditions so narrow and rigorous and such scanty
"opportunity that he is inured to hardship and can
live where a native will not try. /
. Unfortunately the immigration we are receiving is
the slowest to assimilate. Its motive in coming is
entirely material. It has no sentimental attachment
to pur institutions, and indeed does not know that
â¢they exist. The agents of steamship companies have
.told them that this is the land of promise, full of
corn and wine, flowing with milk and honey, and
such of their relatives and countrymen who have
preceded them confirm the story. It is therefore
not a patriotic but a parasitic immigration, and
should excite the profound solicitude of our states
men. ._/
Great as we are in resources, we cannot safely make
this the world's dumping ground. It is folly of the
most extreme sort to be putting millions of dollars
into irrigation by the Federal Government in the
arid States and Territories to relieve the distressing
INCREASING IMMIGRATION.
The Board of Health has added another marvel to
the" wonders - of its disagreeable career. After raising
the salaries of rts already overpaid employes by a pal
pable misappropriation 6f public funds it has volun
tarily reduced these salaries to their former standards
simply upon a. request of the Board of Supervisors.

LORD LONSDALE is the latest authority to
bring reports of the evil conditions brought
about in Australia by socialistic labor laws.
He confirms what has been learned from other
sources of the bad effects upon the community gen
erally of the excessive experiments that have been
made in the direction of state socialism and the ill
considered legislation enforced by labor unions.
We have thus another important witness giving tes
timony that stands as a warning to the American
people to profit by the lessons of Australia and avoid
having to undergo themselves the disastrous expe-.
riences by which such lessons are taught.
It is well known that Australia has not been ad
vancing of recent years. Her industries are lan
guishing, enterprise is virtually at a standstill, immi
gration is diminishing, the population does not in
crease in anything like the degree that is to be ex
pected of a country so sparsely settled and with such
an abundance of resources. All students of the situa
tion agree that while the long drought of a few years
ago had much to do with the bad condition of affairs,
yet the main evil is that of legislation, which, so far
from encouraging enterprise and industry, tended to
discourage and prevent them.
It appears, however, that Australia has reached the
worst point of her socialistic experiments and that
there will be for some time to come a marked
reaction against the policy that has brought
the country to so bad a plight. One of the
signs of the coming change is the determination
of the Government to procure the construc
tion of the proposed gre.it railway system to
connect the northern with the southern coast
of the island by a syndicate of capitalists instead of
undertaking the work as an enterprise of the federa
tion itself. That is good proof that the people have
learned at last that state construction and ownership
of railroads is not a good thing. To that extent, at
least, they give evidence of having profited some
thing in wisdom by experience to make up for what
they have lost in money.
Another proof of the growth of the Tevolt
against socialism and labor legislation is reported to
have been given in the recent defeat of the Australian
Ministry on the conciliation and arbitration bill. It
is said the defeat of the measure is due wholly to a
determination on the part of the conservative ele
ments of all classes and all parties to rid themselves
and the country of the domination of the radical
leaders. The bill is one of a series designed, as a
labor leader is reported to have said, "to build a
Chinese wall of solid legislation around Australia so
as to keep this country as far as may be for the ex
clusive use and benefit of the wage-earning class."
I The passage of tha measure was strongly desired by
theiabor leaders/and the defeat of it is looked upon
as the most striking evidence yet given of the
strength of the party that has now risen to redeem
Australia from their control.

AMERICANS have occasion to regret one ex
cellent feature in British administration. Un
der the system long in use by that Govern
ment diplomacy is a profession.- Men start at the
bottom as attaches or consuls and go up by pro
motion or merit to the highest place, which is Em
bassador. This secures in the service officers who
are acquainted with many countries, who speak
many languages and have the skill in diplomacy ac
quired by experience.
It is far different from our catch-as-catch-can sys
tem, which oilers no career either in our consular or
diplomatic service. We reward politicians by ap
pointment to last four years, when a new President
comes in and new men are appointed to a service of
which they know nothing and in which they have no
reason fo^ acquiring knowledge, since their service is
to be brief. But every hard and fast system some
times seems to block something that is desirable.
Senator Kearns of Utah has suggested that the
vacancy made by the untimely death of Sir Michael
Herbert, British Embassador to Washington, be
filled by the appointment of Sir Thomas Lipton. Of
course this cannot be done under the rules of the
game. But if it could be Sir Thomas would have all
England stepping to "Yankee Doodle" and all the
United States singing "God Save the King" within
six months.
If peace and good will among men and nations
is the object of diplomacy Lipton is the man to
establish that desirable state between the two coun
tries. He is such an embodiment of manliness and
good fellowship that everybody was sorry he failed
to take the cup away from us, and our pride in the
racing quality of our American yacht was kept in
the background to .spare the feelings of our manly
antagonist. Sir Thomas is that character dear to
the American heart, for he /s a good loser. Nothing
checks the effervescence of his spirits nor dulls his
appreciation of our good will. He is willing to come
over to defeat after defeat and we are so unwilling
to lose him and let him go back disappointed that
we would send the petition of 80,000,000 people to
the King to let him stay as Embassador if it would
do any good.
LIPTON, ' DIPLOMAT.
The California Commission to the St. Louis Expo
sition has issued an appeal to the producers of the
State for autumn products and exhibits of wine. In
these fields, where California excels pre-eminently,
the demand for a proper representation should be
met by an immediate response. There is little time
to lose and the prize at stake is one large enough
to call forth the best energies of all Californians.
The. Superior Court in this city has
omitted to use the proper forms in at
least seven \ Instances, as already ascer
tained. Consequently the following men
tioned seven men must either be re
naturalized or else remain aliens: Martin
Fogarty. 1119 Vallejo street; A. Utech. 11
Clay street; Ernest II. Blohm. 622 Halght
street; Anton Po-isard, 705 Sansome street;
Gustav Koppel. 100 Sunset avenue; Her
man Cohman. 641 Golden Gate avenue; E.
A. Sundlof, 855 Howard street.
There are probably other cases that will
come to light. The court overlooked the
fact that the new law of June 3, 1903, waa
in effect and continued to use obsolete
forms that were good enough before the
new legislation, the use of which now re
sults in failure to secure'a legal naturali
zation. Probably there are many persons
all over California who are in the same
unlucky fix as are the seven men who
are named in the foregoing. This is also
the fact In all parts of Oregon and In the
State of Washington, In fact in . every
State In the United States. The gravity
of the matter is enhanced by the fact
that property rights are affected.
Since Special Examiner Van Deusen ar
rived in San Francisco he has been busily
engaged In interviewing Judges and Jus
tices and in examining the naturalization
certificates that have been issued since
June 3, 1903. He has also sent a circular
letter to courts of naturalization in the
'interior of California requesting informa
tion. The special examiner is studying
up all the conditions attending naturali
zation at all times since the first naturali
zation law was passed in the year 1802.
He says that there are certain phases
that must be considered by Congress, but
he declines to say what these are, not
wishing that his report be anticipated by
the Department of Justice.
C. F. C. Van Deusen,' special examiner
for the Department of Justice, who is in
this city making an Investigation con
cerning the operation of the naturalization
laws, has made discoveries that will be
unpleasant to persons who suppose that
they are naturalized citizens of the United
States, but who will find upon reading The
Call this morning that they are mistaken.
Congress at its last session passed an
amendment to the existing naturalization
law, the purpose of which was to make it
harder for men cherishing anarchistic
sentiments and other objectionable persons
to come into the enjoyment of the elective
franchise In the United States. This was
approved June 3 last and made adherence
to certain form3 obligatory.
It provides, for Instance, that all courts
and tribunals and all Justices and officials
having Jurisdiction in naturalization pro
ceedings shall make careful investigation
and before "issuing the final order or cer
tificate of naturalization shall cause to be
entered for record an affidavit affirming
the truth of every material fact requisite
for naturalization. "And," so reads the
law, "all final orders of courts of naturali
zation hereafter made shall show specifi
cally that said affidavits were duly made
and recorded, and all orders of courts that
fail to show such facts shall be null and
void."
Mr. Cohn, in behalf of Great Britain,
opposed the application. He claimed that
the pleadings on both sides should be ex
changed simultaneously in accordance
with precedent.
After a discussion Minister Bowen In
behalf of Venezuela said he hoped there
would be as little delay as possible. He
added that MacVeagh was returning to
the United States shortly and that Judge
Penfleld of American counsel could not
remain long and he did not desire to be
left alone to defend the cases of both
Venezuela and the United States.
The court will render a decision on this
point to-morrow, after which MacVeagh
will commence his argument.
Subsequently M. Cluenet. in behalf of
Belgium. Spain. France. The Nether
lands and Sweden and Norway, which
states M. Muravieff. the presiding officer,
had described as defendants distinguished
from Great Britain, Germany and Italy,
the blockading powers, asked that the
arguments of the three allied powers be
promptly delivered to him so that the de
fending powers might be prepared to re
piy.
The German representative. Herf
Buenz, complained that the decision vio
lated the protocol and that he would have
to ask his Government for instructions,
but In the meantime he would participate
In the proceedings without prejudice to
German rights.
Wayne MacVeagh. senior counsel for
the; United States, protesting against the
decision of their tribunal, which he de
clared was based on the erroneous suppo
sition that Venezuela accepted the reser
vation of France regarding article 4, un
der which English alone was to be used
in the procedure, except for the argu
ments of counsel.
Arbitrator de Martens, professor of in
ternational law at the University of St.
Petersburg, said that without official doc
uments the tribunal would be unable to
judge of the justice of Mr. MacVeagh's
remarks.
THE HAGUE. Oct. 2.â The Venezuelan
arbitration tribunal has decided that min
utes of decisions and awards in the ques
tion of the preferential claims of the al
lied powers shall be drawn up both in
English and French and that written or
printed memoranda shall be presented in
English and may be accompanied by a
translation in the language of the country
submitting them, and that the discussions
shall be in English or French.
Dickinson proceeded to take up Attor
ney General Finlay's points, dealing lucid
ly with the broad phase of the dlsputs
and enlivening the proceedings with an
occasional story. He was still speaking
when the commission adjourned until
October 5. Dickinson does not expect to
conclude until the evening of October 8.
Carson also maintained that the princi
ple of acquiescence waa not applicable to
the present dispute, and . somewhat sur
prised the audience -by 'declaring that un
der the powers of the treaty of 1903 the
Commissioners had no authority to define,
questions submitted to them; and that
they could neither, lay down the boun
dary nor decide what, constituted the
coast. All the Commissioners could do
was to answer questions submitted " to
them In the treaty, either negatively or
affirmatively. If they cave certain an
swers they might make matters, more
confused than ever and open up a new
series of diplomatic tngles. â¢ â¢
The Solicitor General concluded with an
eloquent reference to Great Britain's un
willingness to give up any of her subjects
into the control of other nations, lie de
clared he thought the public mind- might
think the commission was slow and that
counsel were wasting time, but no" ..time
and no money would ever be wasted If the
long-standing dispute between the two
great and friendly powers could bo
solved by the tribunal. -. .
When Jacob M. Dickinson of counsel
for the United States rose to conclude, the
nrguments the room was fllUnff up with
spectators. He began by .belittling. Â¦ the
minute examinations of maps and the.
bickering over words and details, declar
ing that the case could only be settled by
grasping the central Idea animating the
original negotiators.

.Glasgow -is the' foremost of such cities. Mr.. John
Paul of-.lhat city, 'a distinguished: publicist and editor
of "Larid Values," says: ".I have been interested at
tirhfs in the .visits of American single-taxers here,
\\4s6 profess admiration for. Glasgow's control of
the?,e monopolies,. and'as I look. at your prints advo
cating, a. similar policy for the towns of the United
States J wonder, -in view of our experience here, if
the "game: is worth .the -candle.- The private corpora
tions, it- is asserted, owning and .controlling your
municipal services., control and dominate your local
legislatures. They bribe Councilors to .vote in their
interest -.and further pollute, public life by promoting
the candidature. of their own creatures. But look at
the 'situation" from our point of view. We have 15,
090. mea' ia the employ of the Glasgow City Council
ahd ev<ffy further piece of municipal expansion adds
to 'the. number. JJany cf these' workers are organ
ized and exercise-more and more political influence in
Jhe'return of. their own creatures to the Council. The
men theysuppdrt arenot the ones who' will look after
the interests of the city, but those who will promise
most. to, the" employes of the: Council. The best in
terest .Â©f the city' is a secondary consideration.. In
fact" these worker's can-not sec the city's interest ex
cept through their own, wjiile the more vigilant of
them' work for the return of candidates who will as
sist them or their friends into corporation jobs. A
labor candidate' openly boasted on the hustings of
the number of men he had got into corporation jobs."
What this -means requires no explanation! â¢ Yet
Glasgow was supposed to be under Edenic condi
tions, politically and economical]}'. Let us give pub
lic -ownership, if we are to .enter upon it, a fair trial
by compelling it to observe business principles, and
the first of these is make the Geary-street road carry
ifs own bonds.
whole city the deficiency will be charged off to the
taxpayers without their knowledge, and the road may
report a surplus when there is an actual deficit.-
This, as we have shown, actually happened to the
Government railroads of Australia, where one year a
surplus of $i6b,ooo was reported, when experting the
books proved there was a deficiency of $940,000 that
had been charged off to public account. Now if the
advocates' of bonding the whole city for this benefit
far a small part -of the city are so sure that public
ownership and operation of that road is to be such a
success, why are. they afraid of bonding the road
alone and so making it possible, in the only available
way, to. prove such success? Why,- from their stand
point, do -they; wish' to so~ intermix the running of the
read with the- general fund as to make' a demonstra
tion of failure; of success difficult? The Examiner
prints the statistics of European cities that own and
operate â¢ street- railways. These' statistics stop with
the. number of such cities, and- the mileage of the
ro'ntfs. â¢'â¢'.". â¢ â¢ . â¢' â¢ :
it specifically forbid it. The fact is that the constitu
tion Gf the State .does not contemplate the engage
ment of municipalities in business enterprises. The
public bonds which municipalities may issue were, in
the intendment of the constitution, bonds to raise
money for such purposes of municipal government
as were essential to government only.
Perhaps the advocates of taxing the whole city for
the benefit of a small part of the city have raised
an issue upon which the courts will decide that the
Geary street bonds, made a lien on the whole city,
are invalid The argument, made by the advocates
of confiscaiory taxation, is projected to establish a
parity between the taxpayers and the stockholders of
a privat* corporation, who are made by law respon
sible for deficits caused in the business of the corpor
ation. This parity exists, and its existence is one
part of our argument 1 for making the bands a lien on
the plant only. If that is done a deficit will be ex
posed at once. The taxpayers, the stockholders,
will be made aware of it. and it must be met by them,
either by raising the fares on the line, the issue of de
ficiency bonds, or, if such course be legal, by putting
in 4he tax levy the item, "To meet deficiency in the
operation of the Geary-street railroad."
If, however, the bonds are made a lien on the
THE advocates of bonding- the whole city and
burdening all â¢ the taxpayers .to build the
Geary-street road for the benefit of part of the
taxpayers, who do-'not need .that -benefit, have at last
made answer Co the popular demand that the bonds
shall be a lien on the road alone a-nd not on the city.
It is -significant, that they dtj not answer it as a busi
ness preposition, but by declaring that the constitu
tion does, not specifically permit the bonds to be a
lien on the road. To that we may rejoin that if the
constitution does not specifically permit, neith'er does

TUOLUMNE'S SHUT-DOWN.
The Mother Lode Magnet, speaking of
turning: off the current at the Phoenix
Lake power plant, says that the shut
down this year does not include any of
the mines on the east belt or about Tut
tletown, the Dutch - mine at Quartz,
Jumper at Stent or the Crystalline, near
Jamestown. The Magnet continues: ':. v '
At the Jumper mine half the men were laid
off for a few days. Operations will be re-
Gumed with the auxiliary steam slant. The
management will keep forty stamps dropping
steadily and 100 men at work. This is said
to be the first time that the Jumper mill and
compressor have been kept running during the
dry season. Forty-two men were laid off at
tho Republican mine at Jacksonville, only a
few being retained. The sixty stamps In the
Harvard mill at Jamestown were hung up by
the giving out. of electrlo power. The mine
will- work a few men during the dry season
on development. The Shawmut mine, near
Chinese, let out 200 men, but will keep sixty
men on, doing development work, making re
pairs and running the chlorlnatlon plant. At
the Rawhide, near Jamestown, twenty men are
retained. The Tuolumne Water Company says
it has a considerable reserve supply of water
in two reservoirs and Phoenix Lake, sufficient.
It Is thought, to supply patrons for battery and
other purposes than power for two months.
The Mother Lodo Banner complains of
existing conditions In Tuolumne County,
publishing the following: . *.â¢ ' v Â¦â¢
Tuolumne County has gone Into Us annual
industrial eclipse, awaiting the movements of
Providence In sending: the rains. Hundreds of
men are thrown out of employment and must
either spend all their savings In traveling In
a search for employment or pay it out for
dally expenses during their enforced idleness.
Business men lose money due them from men
who cannot pay up ftnd keep their families
during the dull season and merchants see be
fore them a longer or shorter time of no trade
or credit trade â Hobson's choice. All this dis
tress la the result of lack of water and power.
Every spring the hills and valleys are deluged
with floods of water escaping to the sea. Rivers
and creeks run full of waste water and the
Immense beds of snow In the mountains melt
innocuouply away, tfie escaping water a detri
ment instead t* a blessing to mankind. At
the bejjlnnln* cf every season the great water
company, which holds this county at Us mercy,
makes Us regular annual promise of "plenty
of water to run through till the rains come,"
and every year mines close and the county
swoons through two or three months of drought.
Every year the company, makes new contracts
for the delivery of water and power and spends
money for ditches, pipes, wires' and flumes to
deliver more water while making but feeble
efforts to save more water to make their con
tracts good. Tuolumne .lags .behind all her
Sister counties In the race of progress, hindered
and held . back ' by a moss covered ' monopoly.
Louis Strauss was convicted by Police
Judge Mogan yesterday on a charge of
obtaining money by false pretenses. He
will be sentenced this morning. On Aug
ust 22 he got a suit of clothes from Louis
Conn, tailor, 1156 Market street, and bor
rowed some money on the representation
that he was a miner from the Klondike
and had a lot of gold dust at the Mint.
He had played the same trick upon other
business men.
Said He Was a Klondiker.
Andrew Metzingcr was held to answer
before the Superior Court by Police Judge
Mogan yesterday on two charges, one of
burglary and the other grand larceny.
He was accused of entering the room of
Miss Nora McNamara, 1046 Folsom street,
on August 15 and stealing her trunk,
which was filled with clothes, and of
stealing a bicycle belonging to Oliver W.
Tuttle, 314 Leavenworth street, on August
1. He put up a defense that he had to
steal the articles because his wife was
starving, but the Judge told him he did
it because he was too lazy to work.
Held on Two Felony Charges.

SAN JOSE, Oct. 2.â Martin Ford, who
dropped dead in San Francisco to-day,
was a retired mining man. He was a na
tive of Ireland and 70 years of age. Ford
came to California from the Eastern
States in the early fifties and at once
went to Nevada, He engaged in mining
there for nearly twenty years along the
Comstock and was very successful. In
1S71 he removed to San Jose, where he
has since resided. His home was at 800
West San Salvador street.

It was Brilliont who for twenty-five
hours stood at the pumps and kept the
water out while the vessel made port.
The homeward voyage was very longâ
eighty-five days. Twenty days out the
vessel was caught on the border of a ty
phoon, which, however, was of such lit
tle violence that no damage was done.
Captain Piltz considers himself fortun
ate to be back alive, for the same sea
that carried two of his crew to their
death caught him also ahd had the pilot
house not broken the force of it some
what, he, too, -would have been washed
far out of reach. Frank Brllltont, the Fil

thinks he would have been unable to
bring the schooner safely into Haiphong,
came back on the vessel. ? :. -
SEATTLE. Oct. 2.â The schooner Rob
ert Searles lost her second mate and a
seaman and was badly battered about In
a typhoon one day out from Haiphong,
on her voyage to that port from Seattle.
She arrived last night from the Oriental
port, but It was not until she was placed
on Moron's drydock this morning that the
strain to which she had been subjected
could he realized. Many of her seams were
open and out of them poured the wa
ter that had leaked into the vessel's hold
during the voyage. Barnacles several
inches thick, clung to the bottom. Her
rigg'.ng and all other portions of the
schooner bore evidence of the terrible ex
perience she had been through.
The schooner comes back without Sec
ond Mate Andrew Johnson and Seaman
Antone BerRosso, who went to watery
graves during the storm. Mate Ander
son is not yet fully recovered from in
juries received at the time.- A bent iron
rail on the vessel shows where his head
struck whin he was caught by a moun
tainous sea and Jammed against it. .

When Deputy Coroner Charles Meehan
arrived with the Morgue wagon to take
tho body away, he learned that Kitts had
taken some money out of the pockets of
the dead man, probably for safekeeping.
Meehan called upon him to turn over the

Kitts gave Meehan J155 in gold. Mi". Mee

A power company is being organized by
several operators at Cape Nome to sup
ply all the Seward peninsula with, elec
tricity and water power for hydraulic
mining. It is proposed to use the waters
of several streams that rise in the Saw
Tooth Mountains, east of Point Clarence
and a few miles from salt water, to gen
erate 100,000 horsepower to give electricity
to Nome and all other 'mining districts
on the peninsula. Thp electric current
will then bo utilized to lift water from
rivers and creeks for use in hydraulic
mining. Two engineering parties con
nected with this enterprise are In the
field at 'work.
The Calaveras Citizen says:
The work on the Ophlr or Lloyd mine, on
Central Hill, has progressed satisfactorily, and
the owners are Jubilant over their prospects.
Oliver Emery, representing tne Emery Gold
Mining and Water Company, was in town last
Tuesday. It Is rumored that this company is
preparing to extend Its large ditch; system no
as to convey water to the rich placers known
to exist in the Secret Diggings district, about
three miles north of the town of El Dorado.
\V. H. Clary Jr. has established his head
quarters at the Valente ranch on Indian Creek
and is getting things in readiness to start op
erations on tho South Bank quartz mine. Mr.
Clary intends to start grading the site for his
hoisting works within a week, the hoisting ma
chinery being already on the road to the mine.
Tho first work to be done after the erection
of the hoist will be to sink the present shaft
100 feet dseper. At Sheep Ranch mining ap
pears to be at a standstill just at present. The
mill Is ehut down and the only men employed
at the mine are those who Keep the water
out of the shaft. The business men of the
town and the miners who were employed up to
the time of the present shut down are confi
dent that the affairs of the company, which
are responsible for the present shut down, will
be satisfactorily adjusted by tho contending
stockholders at an early date.
IN CAXAVERAS COUNTY.
John Martin, the contractor, Charles Kline
and a force of six men left Friday for the
Afterthought. They have the contract to burn
and furnish l.BOO.OOO brick to the Great West
ern people. They will build Immense kilns on
the ground, as there is excellent brick clay on
the company's ground near the mine, and will
burn the brick right on the property. It is ex
pected the brick will be ready for use in four
weeks" time and then the work of laying the
foundation for the smelter and other buildings
will commence. In the meantime lumber and
building contracts will be closed and every
thing got In readiness so that there will bÂ«
no Interruption In the speedy Installation ot
the plant. The Afterthought will be a lively
camp in a very short time and already the
effects of the new enterprise are being felt In
adjoining small camps and preparations are
being made to open heretofore unprofitable
mines bo that when the smelter starts the ore
can be hauled to the Great Western plant for
treatment.
The Redding Free Press says that de
velopment work is proceeding quite rap
idly at the Afterthought copper mine.
The Great Western Gold Company is pre
paring to install a 175-ton smelter. Con
tinuing the Press says:
An important strike has been made about
four miles east of Columbia, and for several
days tho citizens of that town have been stirred
into an excitement like those of the early min
ing days. For many months a man named
Vauffhn has been prospecting on the other side
of the Stanislaus. A few days ago he made
his appearance In Columbia with quantities of
rock, all of which showed free gold. His lo
cation is near old Crystal Cave. A big Iron
dyke crosses the country there and can be
traced for several miles. It was on this dyke,
where another vein crosses, that the strike
was made. The locator has a shaft about six
feet deep, all In ora as rich and of the same
character as that he shows. How large the
shoot is no one knows at present. A rush was
made to locate claims and two men, Purcell
and Slgnorcttl, have locations. Ed Murphy
and Sherman Wetmore have also located.
Vaughn Is packing ore to the Von Tromp mill
for the purpose ot making a test run.
It is reported in Tuolumne County that
the Longfellow mine at Groveland has
made a rich strike, but no particulars are
supplied. Tho Mother Lode Banner says:
AVhilo the price of oil has continued to
be low, the value of silver, which is of
great interest in Pacific Coast camps, has
continued to rise. The Government folÂ«
lowed the market from 49 cents to 55 cents
in its purchases for the Philippine coin
age. Then it stopped. Millions of dollars
worth of bullion will be required by the
Government before the Philippine coinage
bill provisions are fully carried out. At
the present price of sliver many silver
camps can produce at a profit.
The Nevada County Miner tells of sev
eral enterprise! that show that there is
lively, interest in Nevada County. Three
miles below Bowmans Dam, on Big Can
yon Creek, William Wheeler has made lo
cation of three adjoining claims that will
be known, respectively, as the Hawkeye,
Ophlr and Excelsior. The claims are
about ten miles from Emigrant Gap. They
were worked together some years ago as
the Hoosier mine. A Company will be or
ganized for development. At the Gray
Eagle mine, near Washington, a five-drill
compressor has been put in. Work is sus
pended for lack of water, but will be re
sumed as soon as the winter rains set in.
A large stamp mill will be placed on the
Zelbright mine next spring.
STRIKES ARE REPORTED.
There are only three California counties
out of the entire array of fifty-seven that
will not make a showing In the statistics
of mineral output for the year 1902. Sev
eral of the counties that are discovered to
have mineral wealth are not represented
by large figures of actual production.
That is according to expectation. But,
considering the area of this State, its
length and breadth, there is probably no
other country on earth that can be shown
to be as uniformly mineralized throughout
practically its entire extent.
Among the surprises contained in the
statistics to be submitted by the State
Mining Bureau will be the figures of the
value of the total output of petroleum in
California for 1902. The production was
very large, but when the price at the
wells ranges from 15 to 25 cents per barrel
for fuel oil it does not, comparatively
speaking, require large figures to ghow
what it sold for in total in the market.
The total gold output of two counties far
surpasses the value in the market of all
the oil produced In the State during the
year 1902.

Each day tnat passes >Â»sens the
chances of saving the bnrk. She now has
sixteen feet of wnter In her hold and the
heavy peas warh over her decks and
pound her on the rocks.
The crew of the Gifford has been paid
off and sought other employment. Cap
ialn Michie Is stiM hoping to sail the Gif
ford back to England, and if any man
can save the bark it is Cnptaln Metcalfe
of Lloyds.
Only a rope stretched from the shore at
Musso] Rock to the wrecked bark Gifford
indicate* that she has not been absolutely
abandoned. Captain John Metcalfe, local
surveyor for Lloyd's Register, represent
ing the marine underwriters, has not en
tirely given up hope of being able to save
the vessel. He went out yesterday on a
tug to inspect the Gifford, and it is possi
ble that with a smooth sea work may be
attempted to unload part of the bark's
cargo of coal and lighten her sufflcicntly
for tugs to pull hrr off the rocks.
In insurance circles the chances of sav
ing the Gifford is looked on as being v*>ry
unlikely. She is posted as being overdue
nnd reinsurance rates wore f<0 per cent on
her yesterday morning. When It was
learned that Captain Metcalfe had gone
to have another inspection cf the Gifford
the rates fell five points.

Chief Concern, as Their Work Is Not Encouraging
THE football season is in
full swing at the two rival
universities, Stanford and

Reliance have developed the
weaknesses of the teams, and
the efforts of the coaches are di -

must develop a line which
can withstand the charges of

As the California Club now has many

players will Join the club shortly and
with those already members will moke a
large entry list In future tournaments.
There will be a meeting of the. board

Monday night. Offlcers will be elected
and committees and delegates appointed.
The club wlli have three delegates to the
Pacific States Lawn Tennis Association.
the handicap doubles event com
menced two weeks ago at the park. The
contestants will be the Baker brothers
of Berkeley and Harry Routh and Charles
Dunlap of this city. Of the thirty-two
teams entered these two were the only
ones to play from scratch.
The Bakers went through their half in
easy fashion, while Routh and Dunlap in
two" cases had an exceptionally hard time
Â¦winning. As the teams will meet on even
terms the Baker brothers are thought to
have the better chance of winning. Many
are of the opinion that Routh aud Dun
lap should receive a slight handicap.
The latter team won the cups once,
while the Baker brothers have never be
fore competed for them. Should Routh
and Dunlap win to-morrow's match they
will lead in the race for the trophies,
needing but one more victory. It will
be a five-set match and will commence
at 2 p. m. It will be played on the pub
lic CQjirts In Golden Gate Park.
The first tournament held on the Cali
fornia Club courts In several months
proved a success last Sunday. For an
opening tournament the handicapping
was well done. The fact that there were
thirteen entries and the event was fin
ished In one day shows how well the
committee in charge did Its work.
This was the first of a series of handi
cap doubles tournaments for the two new
silver cups which are to be won three
times. They will take the place of the
Davis cups, which were won five times
by the Smith brothers. A tournament
will be held each month until the trophies
are disposed of.
In the next tournament Collier and
Mitchell will be the only scratch team, as
Smith and MacGnvin will not play to
gether again In handicap events. Smith
will play with Jus brother, Chester, in
future and will probably be placed on the
mark with Allen and Hill, who won last
Sunday's tourney. Stringham and Sails
bury will be a new team and will also
receive the same handiacp as Hill ! and
Allen. The poorer teams will be given
liberal handicaps, as they were last Sun
day.
THERE will be but one tournament
match on the tennis courts this
week and that will be the finals of
ever retired from the game for a
number of years and then made' good
on his return. Corbett's great pitching
during the last two months has brought
him into prominence all over the coun
try and by next season" the California
boy will be in great demand by some of
the magnates In the East.
When Corbett got into the game this
season, after an absence of six years, the
majority of the fans thought It was a
huge joke. Not one man in ten conceded
Joe had a chance of making good. When
he pitched his first few* games without
showing anything like his ancient form
no one thought he would do, but at the
present time he is considered the best
pitcher in the Pacific Co*nÂ»t-League.
Big Hall of the Los Angeles team was
thought to be a real miracle for the time
being, but since he has been getting his
bumps right along the opinion of the
fans has changed. It is~tunny how they
have got on to Hall suddenly. He has
not won a game for a long lime. He is
always beaten by a wide margin.
If Morley keeps his team together "next
season he will win the pennant again,
and no one can dispute that. The Angels
to-day are a crowd of fast ball tossers
and they could run In almost any com
pany. The chances are the Los Angeles
magnate will have nearly all the same
faces again during the coming season, so
he Is sure to be hot after the pennant.
The long drawn out season is be
ginning to have Its effect here. The fans
of San Francisco are getting too much
baseball. They have begun to lose In
terest In the game. So far as the flag
race goes, it Is all over and has. been for
the last two months. Still we have base
ball every day in the week but one and
It will continue for two months.
This long drawn out season is liable
to effect the sport next year and in other
seasons to come. ' The people may like
It for a while, but they will become tired
of It sooner or later, and when other at
tractions come to the front they will in
all probability abandon the baseball park
and turn their attention to something else.
Charley Irwln met with his first acci
dent of the season on Thursday, when
he was hit by a pitched ball. This is
certainly a piece of hard luck, consider
ing that the gritty player braved all kinds..
oi. accidents during .the season, only to
be injured when the danger point was all
but oassed. It was one of the chances'
of baseball and was unavoidable.

man squad and the prospects of
picking from its members a victorious
team. With but two weeks to prepare for
the freshmen to meet the California
youngsters, things do not look bright for
the cardinal.
Only two preliminary games have been
played by the freshman eleven up to tha
present time, so there has been little op
portunity to Judge of its real strength.
The showing made in those two> contests,
however, was discouraging. An almost
absolute lack of speed and team work was
noticeable, but this condition may be at
tributed largely to the fact that the
coachers have paid practically no atten
tion to the youngsters during the past
three weeks. The coachers have begun to
devote more of their time to the '07 team
and hereafter will drill the freshmen ex
clusively for a half hour or more each
afternoon before the varsity candidates
appear on the field, besides dividing their
attention with them during the regular
practice period.
The poor showing: made in the games
played by the freshmen may be attributed
partly to the fact that a number of the
best players among the first year men did
not go Into the contests. Outside the
freshmen, there are so comparatively few
candidates on the field that the coachers
have found It necessary to remove some
of the '07 men from the freshman squad
and put them with the varsity candidates
in order to have two good teams to pit
against each other.
The men on this gridiron have been al
most Immune from accidents up to the
present timeâ a, result probably due to the
thick coating' of saw dust on the field
and also to the fact that Coach Lanagan
has Insisted on the men taking the utmost
precaution in the way of padding, shin
guards, ankle braces and the like. With
all this care two promising freshmen,
Morphino at center and Minturn at half,
have sustained injuries that may keep
them off the gridiron the remainder of the
season. Morphino has a broken collar
bone and Minturn a badly injured arm.
Crutcher and Goudy of the '07 squad have
been forbidden to play by the resident
university physician. Goudy was putting
up a hard game at right half and looked
a likely man for the position.
While the freshmen seem in a slump,
the varsity men are certainly improving
both in speed and team work. The cold,
snappy weather during the week has put
the big fellows on their mettle and every
night sees hard fought scrimmages be
tween the two elevens. The fact that so
few places on the big team can be con
sidered "cinched" makes the rivalry
among the candidates particularly keen.
The fight for end positions promises to
be one of the most interesting of the sea
son. George Clark, star end on last year's
team, has not entered the game and the
struggle goes merrily on among a half
dozen or more aspirants for the two posi
tions. Preston, '04, who earned hjs VS"
as substitute end two years ago. Is mak
ing a strong bid for one of the positions.
Butterfleld, Stanlford and Wilbur of last
season's second eleven, and Smith, a new
man, are also showing up well. Any or
all of them may be seen in the game with
California in November.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 2.â
Interest in the Stanford gridiron is
beginning to center on the fresh-
There is a chance that Boothe. who is a
promising- fullback, will be put on the eli
gible list of players. On account of th*
limited number of his studies he was left
out of the list sent to Stanford, bufit Is
probable the matter may be adjusted with
the Belmont School, of which *ne was a
member.
There have been no Important changes
In the lln.e-up of the team during tha
week. About the only changes made are"
those due to accidents. The most serious
of these is the loss of Allen, the big right
guard, through an injury to his knee.,
Caminetti. whohad a good chance to play
at left end, has been attacked by appetj
dicitis and 13 spending his tlir.e In a hos
pital. He will not be able to play agala
this season. â¢
A halfback who is likely td give Muther
and Whlpple a nx> for. right half Is Sred
tear, who showed such, good form thla
week that he was' taken oat of the sec
ond eleven and put Into the first. J3nedi
gar is fast on his feet, is a quick thinker
and stands a good chance for; making the
varsity team.
This has been a" disastrous week for
three or four of*U?e> varsity men. Strou<t
and Overall have injured ankles and Stow
and Sterna injured knees, the l&st named
having contracted water on the Joint! The
incapacity, of these men is not expected,
however, to interfere with their" playing
in the game against ' the naval Â¦ school
team to-day on the Berkeley campus.
The freshman team does not seem to
have swung into its proper gait yet. It
has won all its games, bet not with
eraugh margin to warrant the statement
that it is as good as Stanford's Ireshman
eleven. It will likely be much improved,
however, before thÂ« intercollegiate yama
is played on the 19th lnst. . Â»
More will have to fight it out. with Bel
knap and Geary for quartet. ' Both of
these little fellows' .hav> bfeq playing
steadily and Just noiy are better qualified
for the place than More. "..Mtrre has beta,
giving the signals for three years, how
ever, and the chances are that after a
little training he will get back Into- his old
form. â¢ " Â¦ -
the return of Mint and Johnny
More to the gridiron. Mini has been say-
Ing that he would not play on account Â«>f
his studies, but he has finally yielded" -to
the pressure, from the outside. He .Joes

the game, but his presence evejy day on
the field is evidence he will try for hla old
position at left half. More, after hesitat
ing for a month, has put. on the uniform
again. He will try for quarterback.
The return of these men. to the fcld

Owing to the conflict of dates the John
Grace Challenge Cup stake will be post
poned until late in November. Many of
the Eastern and Montana^ kennels will
j-end representatives cut for this event.
A number of coursing men will go from
: here to the Waterloo. P. Mullarky will
take Black Coon and Pasha Pleasant and
G. Lacy Crawford's entire string will go
on. James Sweeney will take Rubber
Ankles, Reckless Acrobat and Ragged
Actor. He also will take the puppies,
; Rocker Arm, Richard Anton and Raby
Aurora, which will start in the Missis
sippi Valley Futurity.
The Junion Champion stake will be the
next classic to be run here. This will be
Its fourth renewal. It was won the first
% time by J. Hurley's O K. Capitol. Ala
meda Kennel's A. J. Martin won it the
second time and W, Slcotte's Reta S the
third time. All Futurity candidates are
eligible. In addition to puppies whelped in
October, November and Decembf'r, 1901.
An eligible litter by Rock Island King-
Irma, now running at Los Angeles, is
thought to have a good chance for the
rich stake. The greyhounds are called
Tom King, Galveston, Rock Island Min
nie and Anna Ryne. They have been win
ning everything in the south, beating
Aeolus,, Lost Chord and others.
E. Baumeister has bought Free From
Flaw and Cubanola from Frank McComb.
A seventy-six-dog stake will make up
the card to-morrow at Union Coursing
Park. There will be special trains at
10:15. 11, 12 and 1 o'clock. The likely win
ners look to be:
The dates for the American Waterloo
have finally been announced. They are
October 31, November 1, 2. 3. The en
trance fee is $25. The Oklahoma Cours
ing Club will add $S25 to the purse. En
tries are limited to sixty-four greyhounds.
P. J. Rellly of this city will act as Judge.
John Keen of St. Louis will be the slip
per.
In the discussion already started the
suggestion has been offered that the
parks cease running in summer for four
or five months. From April or May to
August there are strong counter attrac
tions, which draw many people to the
country, and during this period coursing
languishes. Coursing seems to nourish in
the winter, the greyhounds Wing able to
run in the heaviest downpour.
It is claimed a stoppage of coursing
would tend to scatter the greyhounds and
the patrons of the sport. This is not
borne out by past experience. The gates
cf Ingleside were closed for some years,
yet Its patrons were on hand at the re
opening. It would mean a higher stand
ard of greyhounds, as only the best would
be fed and cared for during the off sea
son.
For seven years there has been coursing
two or more days a week In or near this
city, the major portion of the time two
parks being in operation. This has given
the followers of the sport a surfeit of it.
No sport was ever known to hold its fol
lowers for years without intermission and
it is not expected coursing will break the
rule.
governing body of the sport on
this coast, must discuss the desirability
pt closing all the parks in its Jurisdiction
for a stated period each year.
COURSING MEN are of the opin
ion that, sooner or later, the Cali
fornia Coursing Committee, the

mittee Will Be Asked to

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 2.âTo
morrow afternoon the varsity eleven .will
meet the Reliance football team in the
second game of the series with the club
men. Since the club team has held down
both the rival university elevens to a 0
to 0 score, the contest to-morrow will
prove of unusual interest. v'. ,
Some changes may be made In the car
dinal llne-un. but the personnel of tho
two teams will be largely the samo as it
was two weeks ago. Weller, '07, who has
been playing tackle, is being tried at full
back and will probably appear in the
game at that position. The loss of Mc-
Gllvray at fullback has proved a hard
blow to the varsity. The coaches are
using every endeavor to get a strong man
to replace him. -.:;"? ~

The way Ham rberg*s offerings were
clouted is sorrowful to relate. Every An
gel on the team was willing and ready to
take a chance at onÂ© of Ham's
shoots. They were charitable enough to
let the first innlns pass without landing
any solar plexus wallops. They began to
get busy In the second, and then.it was
curtains. First they inaugurated the
gamo of laying 'em down for bunts. "When
they grew tired of this diversion they
would swing savagely, and the ball gen
erally disappeared in thÂ© wilderness. The
long blnglc3 were made generally when
the bags were well decorated with south
ern base runners, so what followed can
be imagined as easily as explained.
More pretty bunts were laid down on
the third base line yesterday than on any
previous occasion In the history of Rec
reation Park. Fully half of the sixteen
Angel hits were made in this way. Little
Raymond did not know whether he wa3
on a ball field or a ballroom floor when
the giants began to roll the ball in his
territory. Dillon was the best man at
this game, beating: out four.
Hall for the Angels had the homo
stickers safely under the spell of his fast
ball in every Inning. They never made
any kind of a bid for a run. He was well
supportedâ and, for that matter, so was
Ibergâ the nlayera being so busy hitting
out clean drives they forgot all about
making errors .for the time being.
Bobby Eagar, who once caught for Sac
ramento when the league was not as fast
as it is .now. was given a -chance behind
the bat in the last two innings. He did
not have a show to 3hine. but he works
like a good backstop. Ho will soon be
given plenty to do. If he makes good
Morley will have him on his staff for next
season. The score:

After the walkover of the Pirates yes
terday a Boston victory by any old mar
gin would have brought joy to the local
rooters. When Parent threw out Clarke
to Lachance in the ninth inning, ending
the game with a necklace of ciphers as
Pittsburgh sole reward, the enthusiasm
of the fans gave way to a demonstration
the like of which has never been seen
on a Boston ball field. Out of the grand
stand and bleachers hundreds of specta
tors tumbled pell-mell and, seizing big
Bill Dineen, the hero of the day, before
he had a chance to escape, they bore him
aloft in triumph, \v*w.e hundreds and
hundreds of others, delirious with joy,
did the whirling dervish act around the
diamond until compelled to stop through
sheer exhaustion.
Never since he began his career on the
slab has Dineen twirled in more masterly
fashion th8n he diil to-day. Leever did
not live up to his reputation. Boston se
cured three hits off him, Including a
home run and a double, in the first in
ning, besides a pass. This was too much
for Clarke, who promptly ordered him to
the bench for the remainder of the game
and sent Vail in to take -up tho burden.
The youngster did well, but his work suf
fered by contrast with that of Dineen.
With each team having a victory to its
credit speculation is rife about to-mor
row's prospects. Attendance, 9400. Score:
R. H. E.
Boston 3 0 0
Pittsburg 0 3 2
Batteries â Dineen and Crlcer; Leever, Vail

Jump, leaving tho remainder of the field
to fight It out in a gruelling finish.
Mr. Rose kept in the course well up
with his field and turned into the main
track as though guided by *a rider, and
then showed great gameness In a long
hard drive with John E. Owens, which
he beat out by . a length. Incidentally,
John E. Owens was made the medium of

OAKLAND, Oct. 2.â The recital given
this evening at the First Unitarian
Church by the violin pupils of Alexander
Stewart was one of the musical successes
of the season. With his accustomed
promptness Mr. Stewart opened the coif
cert on time and there were no waits.
Mr. Stewart gave his class ample oppor
tunity in its rendition of Haydn's difficult
symphony No. 2, D major, to exhibit a
skillful and melodious interpretation.
Other orchestral numbers were the sex
tet from "Lucia" and the march Â»from
"Tannhauser." Two solos by the twenty
violins in unison were cleverly done. Miss
Gertrude Stuart Holmes sang pleasingly.
The violin quartet, Miss Gertrude Hib
berd. Miss Fannie Lawton, Miss Mlna
Clarke and Miss Sydney Miller, was de
lightful. Edward B. Jordan, a young
cornetist of this city, gave two pretty
numbers. Musicians were favorably im

advantage in the bringing up of its mem

DISCUSSES PATENT LAWS
WITH TECHNICAL SOCIETY
George W. Dickie Speaks to Experts
on Mechanical Arts and Their
Protection.
The Technical Society met last night at
the Mechanics' Institute, Marsden Manson
in the chair. The members were much
interested in a paper read by George W.
Dickie entitled. "Is It Not Time to Con
sider Whether Patent Laws are Longer
Necessary to Progress in Mechanical
Arts?"
The position taken by Dickie was that
patents should be granted only for real
Inventions. He held that combinations of
well known mechanical devices to accom
plish well known results should never be
granted the protection of patent laws.
He considered that such protection, in
stead of stimulating the progress of me
chanical arts, had a very wide and disas
trous result In retarding progress of in
many branches of applied mechanics. A
general discussion of the subject followed
the reading of the paper.
Plumber's Shop Catches Fire.
An employe in R. Rice's plumbing shop,
at 111 Geary street, got some oakum too

the interior of the establishment was

The prompt arrival of the fire engines
prevented the destruction of the building,
which is a small two-story affair. As it
was, the blaze did little damage.
Oakland Office San Francisco . Call,
1118 Broadway, Oct. 2.
Superior Judge W. E. Greene Â¦ to-day
sustained a demurrer to the petition of
certain citizens of Alameda for a writ of
mandate to_ compel the City Trustees of
Alameda to submit the applications of the
Southern Pacific Company for franchises
to a vote of the people of Alameda before
the Trustees should take action.
"Halting, decrepit and not worth -the
paper it is written on" is his Honor's
option of the ordinance under which
the petitioners sought to compel the Trus
tees to submit the propositions.
According to Judge -Greene the peti
tioners based their hopes on an ordinance
that entirely misconce ived the poweYs of
a City Board of Trustees to either dele
gate Its powers or to bind a future board
by its acts. In giving his opinion he said:
'â¢The Board of Trustees of the city of
Alameda, under an act of the Legisla
ture, was given certain powers. One of
these was to grant franchises. This power
will stand eo long as the statute that con
fers It No board has the right to shear
itself of any of these powers. The act of
one board acting under the samo rule
cannot bind the action or curtail the
powers of a subsequent board. The. thing
is an absurdity, on. the face ot if and' I
do not believe that any part of.it is
worth the paper it is written on."
Another alleged defect in the ordinance,
which was discovered before the validity
of the Question was gone into, was the
fact that nowhere did the ordinance pre
tend to state when such an election could
be called, or give a board any right to
call an election. In speaking on this point
Judge Greene said:
"There is nothing in the ordinance that
gives the. board the right to call such an
election as you ask for. Any citizen could
stop It, The only other thing that could
be done would be to submit the question
at . a general election, . now two years
away. There is no power in a city 'board
to tie up the powers of a future board
for two years and keep it from exercising
the rights given it by the Legislature."
The demurrer to the petition was sus
tained and the injunction denied. On mo
tion the former order will not be entered
for a week to give the petitioners = oppor
tunity, if they wish, to see if Â¦ they â¢ can
in any way amend their petition.
The matter came up to-day on the hear
ing of a, petition signed by H. Â¦ Rosenthal,
H. A. Thompson, J.*, H. Houck and T. F.
Balrd, representing the Board of Trade of

Council.
ASKS RECOMPENSE FOR
BROKEN JAW AND NOSE
Mr. Dornin has been for forty years an
insurance man, and Is now the oldest In
surance official In point of years and ser
vice in California. He Is the manager for
the National Insurance Company of Hart
ford and the Springfield Fire and Marine
Insurance Company of Connecticut, and
a leading member of the Underwriters'
Union of San Francisco. - Associated with
him in the extensive business Is his son.
George W. Dornin, who- occupies a lead
ing position in the insurance world and
has been highly honored In his home city
of Oakland.
Mr. Dornin came to California when the
gold rush became contagious, in 1849. He
left his home In New York and came
around Cape Horn in the ship Panama,
arriving in San Francisco in August of
'49. The mining fever drew him to Ne
vada County, where he remained until he
met Miss Baldwin and married her.
Then, when there was an offer of better
and surer progress in other businesses,
he abandoned mining and went into insur
ance. â¢
and going of guests. There were many
golden offerings to the hosts arid the pres
ents filled a table set apart for them.
Mr. and Mrs. Dornin were married In
Grass Valley on October 2, 1S53. 'They met
In January of that year, soon after Mrs.
Dornin's arrival with her parents from
New Bedford, Mass. She was then Miss
Sarah A. Baldwin, the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Samuel Baldwin. The family
had been attracted by the gold e*xcite
ment and came to California by way of
the isthmus.

IS FOUND VOID
evening the golden anniversary
of their wedding. Fifty years ago they
met In California, when California, the
State, was younger than they, and mar
ried. Since then they have lived happy,
peaceful lives together through the long
list of years, strived and reared children
who* are now fathers and mothers them
selves. And in spite of time's aging pro
cesses they are still with the van of the
human pageant â a remarkably old couple,
yet remarkably young.
The Dornins were surrounded this even-
Ing by their children and grandchildren
and their friends of the early California
days. It was a reunion that was not
strictly confined to the limits of the fam
ily. The five children were thereâ George
W. Dornin, president of the Oakland City
Council; John C. Dornin of San Francis
co; Mrs. George G. Eldredge, wife of the
pastor of St. John's Presbyterian Church
of San Francisco; Mrs. Cray ton W. Wil
kinson of Berkeley and Mrs. Hubert Bry
ant of Berkeley. Then there were the
seven children of these children and a
number of California pioneers and old
friends to swell tho list of guests.
It- was a very simple affair, this celebra
tion, even though it was such an im
portant event in the lives of the cele
brants. It consisted merely of the offer
ing of congratulations and the coming

The Sentence of dismissal and one year's
imprisonment pronounced against Lieu

fantry-was remitted to dismissal without
oorvnnement. He was charged with scan
dalous.conduct unbecoming an officer and
gentleman and embezzlement, but the
latter charge was not proven directly.

against -Lieut-eaant Buckcr of the Philip

.WASHINGTON, Oct. 2.-Pre6l(3ent
Roosevelt to-day commuted the sentence
of dismissal -from service pronounced by
court-martiiJ against Lieutenant Louin
McL Hamilton of the Fourteenth United
States* Infantry, the great-grandson of
Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary
of th'e Treasury.
Lieutenant Hamilton was charged with
having made offensive remarks while in
toxicated "about a brother officer's family.
There were certain extenuating cirtum
trtanees, among them the fact that the
officer* .had not personally resented tho in
sult, but had" made complaint through
official" channels, which influenced the
'President to restrict the eentence to the
lÂ«*ss of 116 numbers in rank and a public
apology in .the presence of his superior
officer fdr his conduct. The excellent ree
c-ra arid illustrious lineage of Lieutenant
Hamilton were factors in his favor.
In th,ree other court-martial cases, how
ever, . President Roosevelt wielded dis
â¢rntssal with fatal effect.

service and two. years' imprisonment pro

Examination of the records at San Ra
fael shows that George W. Galloup and
Miss Jessie Skinner Burbank, not desir
ing the services of a minister of the gos
pel or a Judicial officer, entered into a
contract of marriage and proclaimed
themselves husband and wife. The con
tract is dated Lorin. Alameda County,
February 16, 1S92, and it shows that it
was acknowledged a year and a half aft
erward, when it was agreed that the mar
riage took place on the original date. It
Is said that a marriage contract made at
that time is not invalid, as the law per
mitting those marriages was not repealed
until 1S93.
The contract was drawn up in Lorin and
dated February 16, 1S92, but was not ac
knowledged by a notary until November
1, 1833.
All theae years the existence of the
contract lias been kept secret. Mrs. Bur
bank is a dressmaker, owning a little es
tablishment In Berkeley. She was al
ways known as Mrs. Burbank. never hav
ing assumed the name of her husband.
When interviewed to-day about the con
tract marriase Mrs. Burbank refused to
talk and said that it was nobody's affair
why she delayed until to-day in record
ing her marriage notice. "There is noth
ing to say," she said. "Mr. Galloup died
several years ago and the affair was all
"ever with. It is my own private busi
ness and I had reasons for not wishing it
to be known that the contract marriage
existed."
Eleven years ago Mrs. Jessie S.* Bur
bank of 1759 Alcatraz avenue entered into
a contract marriage with George Wijk
ware Galloup. Galloup has been dead for
several years, and It was not until this
morning that the marriage notice was
recorded at San Rafael. . ...";.* v
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. Oct. t.
The Justices of the Peace already see
visions of a rush in marriage fees and are
busily appointing assistants to handle the
anticipated increased business. Â»
. Wednesday night is prayer-meeting
night, also a very popular night for the
Inauguration of matrimonial life, hence
the trouble: Pastors officiating at these
popular functions have had . to absent
themselves from their flocks quite often
in order to make the hitch at a wedding.
The congregations want their pastors on
Wednesday nights and say that engaged
couples must *make their dates accord
ingly. '
The pastors of three of the central
churches got together to ascertain if some
arrangement could not be made that
would be satisfactory, to both sides. Dr.
Charles R. Brown, pastor of the First
Congregational Church, proposed to the
Rev. E. E. Baker, pastor of the First
Presbyterian Church, and to the Rev. E.
R. Dille. pastor of the First Methodist
Church, that the prayer-meeting night be
changed to Friday evening, so that happy
couples could still rutain their favorite
Wednesday evening for marriages and
dodge the "hoodoo" day.
.The matter was brought before the
various congregations and given its
quietus by an overwhelming vote.
No argument on the part of the pastors
could induce the people to give up their
Wednesday evening prayer-meeting. So,
if you want to get married on Wednes
day evening you'll have to come before
7 o'clock or after 9 o'clock,, or go else
where.
Young people or old people who are
contemplating marriage on a Wednesday
evenings, between 7 and 9, and who want
the assistance of an uptown Methodist,
Congregational or Presbyterian minister
to tie the knot, must either for
get it, change their denomination or
go to the Justice of the Peace. Such is
the decree of the three ministers and the
congregations representing the foremost
churches of the three mentioned denomi
nations in the district named.

Falconer was formerly a well known
resident of this city and served one term
as a member of the Board of .City Trus
tees. He took an active interest in munic
ipal affairs a"nd for a time was engaged
in dealing in local realty. He moved to
San Francisco five years ago.
of him, Dr. .Stafford.- who* Is a close
friend of the deceased, said: >> *
- "I kaew .Falconer well and kijqw' that
the thoughfthat he owed money he could
not pay -cast a shadow over his l.Â«fe. Htt
was fafrly well to do once, and wbeli mis
fortune overtook him he toiled Incessantly
to meet his debts and applied all he earn
ed to liquidating his obligations.'*, â¢ â¢
ALAMEDA. Oct. 2.â "I.-dlo to Â«pay tny
debts; I die to-night." The.se worjis were
inscribed in a. letter received to-day by
Dr. A. A. StafTord and written fcy. Rich
ard -S.. Falconer, whoso dead body was
found in a room in a San Francisco lodg
ing-house yesterday. Falconer ende* hia
rifte by Inhaling illuminating gas while
despondent because of his financial and
friendless condition. He was a .member
jbt the Ancient Order of UnitÂ»d Workmen
and in his communication to Dr.. Staf
ford requests that the physician pay cer
tain small obligations owing Alameda
friends, out of the .$2000 policy he held in
the fraternal organization.
His friends declare he was mentally un
balanced when he resigned as the result
of long service in the tropics. Represent
ing himself as still in the army, he is said
to have obtained money dishonestly in
various places In the United States. When
he returned here he declared he had no
recollection of events from the time he
left the Philippines until he found himself
working on a farm near St. Louis, whence
he came to Washington about two
months ago.
A Washington boy, young Hamilton,
until recent months, led a most exem
plary life. His father, who died many
years ago, was employed under the Gov
ernment here. His mother is prominently
identified with the Wlmodaughsls Society
and Is highly esteemed. Hamilton, who is
about 24 years of age, was educated in the
public schools of this city. When war
was declared with Spain in 1S38 he enlist
ed in the Signal Corps and rendered good
service In Cuba. Then he was sent to the
Philippines, where he served at various
posts, performing arduous work.
Promotion came to him on his merits.
He was appointed second lieutenant In
the One Hundred and Twenty-second
Company of Artillery arm-ordered to Fort
Columbus. N. Y. Before he could sail
from the Philippines he was transferred
to the Twenty-fifth Company at Manila.
In December last, after having served five
years continuously in the tropics, he was
expecting to be ordered home when he
was transferred to the Tenth Company of
Artillery, then en route to the Philippines.
He resigned his commission and came to
this country.
WASHINGTON. D. C. Oct. 2.-Lewis C.
Hamilton, formerly second lieutenant in
the United States army, voluntarily re
turned to Washington August 11 last to
answer charges against him of irregular
money transactions In this city. He has
been In Jail here since that time. Several
physicians who have examined him be
lieve him irresponsible and will recom
mer.d his removal to the Government In
sane Asylum.
HIS FRIENDS DEFEND HIM.
Claim Hamilton's Long Service in
Tropics Affected His Mind.
All the foregoing forgeries are within
the jurisdiction of the United States
courts. The following are under the juris
diction of the State courts: He forged
the name of Bruce Cotton to two notes
held by the Security Loan and Trust
Company, at 21 Stockton street, in this
city, and received $445 for them. Lieuten
ant L. C. Hamming transferred his pay
account for November and December,
1&02. to Hamilton, who drew the amount,
$233, from Captain Holloway. On Janu
ary S Hamilton forged a duplicate and
drew the same amount from Major Hal
ford at Manila. When Halford's account
was received in Washington the forgery
of the duplicate was discovered. Hamil
ton forged about a dozen other pay ac
counts and obtained money on them, C.
H. Morrell of this city being the prin
cipal victim.
The case will be presented to the Fed
eral Grand Jury In this city and Manila,
and Indictments will be found at an early
date.
Frequenters of San Francisco's tender
loin will remember gay and debonair
Lieutenant Lewis C. Hamilton of the Sec
ond Light Artillery Corps by the spilled
champagne he left in his wake while he
was joyfully engaged in pelting money at
the birds. The gay lieutenant is now in
jail in Washington, D. C, with several
charges of forgery hanging over his head.
On St. Valentine's day in this year he
tendered his resignation from the army
for reasons best known to himself and to
his superior officers, and for the same
reasons it was accepted promptly. Both
before and after he severed his connec
tion with the army the reckless lieuten
ant kept his purse full by forging the
pay account* of his brother officers and
hypothecating them at. the usual com
mercial rate of discount.
Several of the forgeries were committed
in Manila, several in San Francisco, one
or two in Chicago and one in Washing
ton, D. C. In each of these districts in
dictments will be preferred against him
by the United States Grand Jury for the
offenses committed while he was connect
ed with the army, and for the forgeries
committed outside the jurisdiction of the
Federal courts he will be liable to indict
ment by the county Grand Juries.
The crime for which he is incarcerated
in Washington Is the forgery of the pay
account for May, 1903, of Lieutenant
Claude E. Brigham. While in the military
service he transferred his pay account for
November and December, 1902, to Louis
Silverman of New York, and presented
duplicate accounts at Manila for the same
months and drew pay thereon. He also
presented the forged pay account of Lieu
tenant W. S. Bowen of the Coast Artil
lery for April, 1903, and assigned it to Sil
verman. The account was paid by Colonel
Dodge. The pay account of Bowen for
June, 1903, he assigned to C. H. Morrell
on May 16 to secure a loan; also the pay
account of Lieutenant Bruce Cotton of
the Second Light Artillery for May, 1903,
which was paid by Major Payson.
The forged pay account of Lieutenant
Bruce Cotton was assigned by Hamilton
to Major Hooper at the Occidental Hotel
in this city. Hamilton also assigned the !
forged pay account of Lieutenant A. S.
Fuger of the Artillery Corps at Manila to
the E. A. Armstrong Manufacturing
Company of Chicago.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
There was a heavy accumulation of river Po
tatoes on the wharves and the market contin
ued very quiet for common offerings. Salinas
Burbanks were in moderate supply and steady
under a fair demand for local use. Oregon
lturbanks ruled weak at previous prices. The
Portland steamer arrived late in the day with
1342 sacks. Sweet Potatoes were, lower under
heavy receipts. Three carloads came in frcm
Merced and there were liberal receipts from
Stockton. Onions were abundant and easy.
Tomatoes arrived freely, but the demand for
good stock was steady and prices were main
tained. Pome strictly fancy stock sold up to
Â«."ic per box In a small way, but the common
run of supplies sold within the quoted range.
String, Wax and Lima Beans were easier un
der liberal receipts and a light demand. Prices
of the other vegetables had no quotable change,
supplies being sufficient to satisfy the demand.

wheat and corn exports over last week Indi

ported for August; while Union Pacific, with
a decrease fcr that period of $142,812, was well

While engaged In attending to some nets
In the vicinity of Blossom Rock, William
Barlow, a fisherman, discovered, the badly
decomposed body of a man floating in the
bay. He made a rope fast to the body
and towed it to Fisherman's wharf. The
Coroner was notified and the body taken
to the Alorgue. The features were entire
ly gone and it is the opinion of the offi
cials that the deceased had been in the
waters of the bay for more than a month.
The dead man was coatless and all that
remained of the wearing apparel was a
blue flannel shirt, black trousers and gray
underwear. A significant feature and one
that lends color to a foul play theory is
the fact 'that "both pockets In the pants
have either been. torn or cut away and ab
solutely no property was found on the
body.

The Union Oil Company filed a petition
for permission to use a spur track on
Illinois street to connect with the tracks
of the Santa Fe Company. The Interest-
Ing fact was disclosed that the spur track
was laid by some parties unknown with
out permission from the Board of Super
visors. The committee expressed aston
ishment at the discovery, and . then refer
red the matter to the Board of Works for
investigation and report.
The petition of property owners that
the so-called "cemeteries" block and the
blocks north of Lake street and west of
First avenue be renumbered by the As
sessor and City Engineer was favorably
reported upon.
The committee reported !n favor of
changing the name of Sullivan street to
Parnassus avenue.
The committee decided to hear the ap
peal of G. D. Clark from the assessment

The petition of John Kelso for permis
sion to explode blasts at Lombard street,

Charles F.' O'Callaghan, president of
the San Francisco and Southern Railway
Company, appeared to urge the granting
of a franchise to his road. He assured
the committee that the petition was made
in good faith and the road was to run
from Santa Cruz to this city.
"So far as I am concerned," said Su
pervisor Braunhart, "you will have to
give us the names of those who are back
ing the enterprise. We had one petition
of this character from the Bay and Coast
Railway Company, of which W. T. Bag
gett was president, and we denied the
application mainly because we could never
learn who the promoters were. My senti
ments apply to any other company seek
ing a franchise."
The petition of the Atchison, Topeka

thereon was also postponed for one week.
The committee reported In favor of a
proposed ordinance amending the speci
fications for street work so that no cob

Both the Western Pacific Railway Com
pany and the San Francisco and South
ern Railway Company, who have filed
petitions for franchises to enter the city
at certain designated points and thence
along certain streets, must give the Board
of Supervisors full information regarding
the promoters and backers of the corpor
ations before they can hope for favorable
action on their applications. This ulti
matum was delivered yesterday by the
Street Committee of the board, and fur
ther consideration of the two petitions
was postponed for. one week.

dent Sabin has maintained from the first
against the demands of the striking em
ployes the belief is very strong that it Is
the strikers, and not the employers, who
have had to give way in the present in
stance, and that the linemen will be re
turned upon practically the same basis
as that which they held before the trou
ble with the telephone company com
menced.

A. Wilson appeared before the Board of
Public Works yesterday and informed that
body that B. Lantry & Sons are in the
habit of firing off heavy blasts in the
Fotrero despite the order of the Board of
Supervisors that they cease doing so.
Wilson stated that extraordinarily heavy
charges of powder were used by the firm
after 6 o'clock, when the inspector of the
board had gone home. Wilson stated that
his house had been severely shaken by
the blasts, and the board detailed an in
spector to Investigate the complaint.
The board awarded the contract for re
paving Spear street, between Market and
Mission, to the City Street Improvement
Company, the lowest bidder.
The board granted a permit to former
Police Commissioner Newhall to remove
his building from the corner of Van Ness
avenue and Sutter street to a lot on' Pa
cific avenue, near Flllmore street. The
petition was modified so that the house
will be moved along Van Ness avenue
for two blocks only, thence will be taken
out Pine to Webster, thence to its desti
nation. v-i;j : . : - :Â¦>'Â¦- -

advised him to go upon the stage and
offered him a position. "Mr. Morrissy de

occupy two or two and a half hours.
The music will be under the direction
of Dr. H. J. Stewart and the 6tage man

ELABORATE SERVICES.
The Fe<iSt of tue Roses, an occasion al
waj-3^ celebrated with great pomp and
cpler/Jor by Catholic churches through
out the world, is to be fittingly observed
by tho .Dominican Fathers of this city to
nion'ow. â¢ The sacred edifice at Bush and
Eteir.cr streets will be specially decorated
vclth the most beautiful flowers, and
scenes of profound piety and devotion
Till taark the festival.
The Feast of the Roses dates back as
far as th" year 1371. It was then that the
T-irks were sweeping all before them and
Europe was in grave danger of falling
entirely Into their hands. On October 7.
1T7 1 , .the "Christian fleet, under the com
ir.cnd of King John of Austria, routed the
Turks and urove them back to their own
Itnd. ;â¢ . '
It way at the famous battle of Lepanto
thru a number of pious people gathered
together and solemnly recited' the rosary.
T^ey preyed God to deliver the Christian
forces frcm their Turkish enemies. And
Cnplly, according to tradition, their
prayers were answered, for shortly after
111* Tu'ks were forced to retreat, and
ever Einc e that time Catholics in every
part Qf the world celebrate the Feast of
the iioses each year, and the day is set
apart ajs one of thanksgiving for the de
liverance cf the Christians from their
cr.crnics. Â¦
The strife between the telephone com
pany and its linemen had its .inception in
the walkout which was made by the em
ployes in Los Angeles on May 4. All of
the other local unions of electrical work,
ers In ev^ry city which Is embraced by
the eystem of the telephone company
then took up the cause of the strikers in
the southern city. A demand was* made
that the uniform wage of {3 50 a day for
all Journeymen linemen should be paid
by the company and that the union
should be recognized. Upon the refusal
of tho" directors of the corporation to ac
cede to these demands a general strike
of all the linemen in the coast States,
At the headquarters of the union last
night It was not admitted that any move
ment toward bringing the strike to an
end had been made. The members of the
union declared complete Ignorance of the
mission which had brought their national
officers out to a conference with Sabin.
They said that whatever action may be
determined upon will be discussed at a
special meeting of the union to-night.
HOW THE STRIKE BEGAN.
The conference lasted more than two
hours. At its finish the representatives
of the striking employes would make no
statements concerning the results of tho
session, but Sabin stated that its object
was to talk over the situation with a view
to coming to an amicable agreement upon
the mooted questions and that the results
were satisfactory to himself and the com
pany of which he Is the head. It is un
derstood that the linemen will return to
work on Monday.
"We will have another meeting to-mor
row morning," said President Sabin,
"when I expect that all disputed ques
tions will be settled and that the strike
will be at an end. The national officers
who have been in conference with me
are free to admit that the strike had not
sufficient merit of provocation and that it
has been their desire ever since they took
office to bring the labor trouble to an
end."
It Is said that by this evening the strike
of the linemen employed by thÂ© Pacific
States Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany, which has been in force over the en
tire system of the company since June 23,
will be at an end. After a conference be
tween President John I. Sabin of the cor
poration and three national officers of the
Electrical "Workers' Union held yesterday
afternoon, Sabin announced that thÂ©
strike was virtually over and that a
second conference to be held to-day will
clinch matters.
After the election of national officers of
the brotherhood, which was held at the
convention in Salt Lake three weeks ago,
it became evident that the new set of
officials was not strongly in sympathy
with the strike on the coast and that
measures of conciliation would be" insti
tuted by them. To that end the newly
chosen president of the national body, T.
J. McNulty, came to this city a few days
ago, together with J. H. Walters, a mem
ber of the Western conference. These
officers, with Michael J. Sullivan, who is
seventh vice president of the national
brotherhood and is employed in the de
partment of electricity in this city, made
the first steps toward ending the strike
by calling upon President Sabin at his
office yesterday. . ? Â£?*jÂ£:,
I*0NQ CONTEBENCE HEM).
The answer of the council is a complete
denial of every one of the charges brought
by Costen and Is In addition a relation of
many incidents tending to show that its
action was Justified. According to the
document Costen is a disturber, a man
of ungovernable temper and one who has
ever since his election to the executive
board of the council provoked strife. Ho
is charged with assaulting A. E. Yoell,
a fellow member, and with almost biting
the finger oft J. J. Swanson, delegate to
the council. Tho answer also charges
Costen with acting improperly at nearly
every meeting of the body he attended and
with threatening to "use his influence"
to disrupt the body unless he was given
the position of manager of the new head
quarters of the council. He was suspend
ed last January because of these alleged
acts of Insubordination. Since then, it
is averred, he has been communicated
with several times and requested to "ap
pear before the council to make proper
protest against his suspension, but has
failed to accept the chance to prove him
self worthy of membership.
Henry Costen's ambition to become
manager of the new Market-street head
quarters of the Building Trades Council
is, acordlng to a legal document filed yes
terday by the council, one of the causes
of tho row between the council and the
Cornice Workers' Union, of which Cos
ten is secretary.
The document Is an answer to Costen's
suit for a writ of mandate compelling the
council to restore him as representative
of the ccr'nlce workers to membership In
the council. The suit was brought on the
ground that Costen was expelled without
a chance to defend himself and contrary
to the by-laws and regulations of the
council. . V - ' .
