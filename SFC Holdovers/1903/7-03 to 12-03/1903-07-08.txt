-yvOME, July 8, 2:15 a..m. â Pope-Leo is now sleeping; but
A^ his head lies uneasy on the pillow. The alleviation
â¢ \* brought about by yesterday's operation for removing the
fluid from his pleura was followed later in the evening by- a rest
less^period, and fresh doses of chloral, digitalis and caffeine had
to.be administered. Under their influence the Pontiff fell into a
slumber, which, however, was not very peaceful, on accoimt of the
difficulty the patient has in breathing, i Seeing Dr. Lapponi al
ways by his bedside, the Pope, .just before falling asleep, said
kindly to him :
"Now it is your turn to-night. You must sleep."
Throughout the Vatican absolute calm prevails to-night, the
excitement of yesterday having to a great extent died out with the
revival of hope after ,the announcement that yesterday's Operation
was ended with success. ...
Dr. Mazzoni fears a reproduction of f the â¢ serum in the; Pope's
pleura, in which case the operation of yesterday will have to be
repeated in about two days. - l \

Pope and by journalists inquiring- as to the result of the operation
and his prognosis of the disease. He made the following state
ment:
"When one considers 'that the Pope should be dead by this
time the unexpected may happen and there is still hope. His re
sisting so long and maintaining Â¦ perfect lucidity of mind' means
that, notwithstanding the pneumonia, the affection of the kidneys
and the difficulty in breathing, there is no poisoning of the blood.
Between being at the point of death and returning 1 to what his
Holiness is to-night there is certainly such a difference as to permit
"To properly understand the change which has taken place it
must'be considered that on Monday the conviction was so sure
that he would die during the night that, notwithstanding the con
trary opinion of Dr. Lapponi, those surrounding the Pope insisted
on having extreme unction administered. Evil tongues even in
sinuated that some members of Pope Leo ? s : ; immediate circle
counted on the bad effects that such a function was likely to pro
duce on a -weakened organism, but the Pope resisted splendidly.
Indeed, he seems to have acquired; fresh strength.

COLLISION
We will question the right of any street rail
way company to transfer its franchise to any
other concern on the ground that such a pro
ceeding invalidates the franchise. Should this
be the law, and I think it is. the Interests of
my clients would naturally be jeopardized. In
that the city at any time might proceed to have
the old franchises revoked on the ground of a
violation of their provisions. It U a notorious
fact that the whole street railway deal was a
prearranged affair, in which a foreign corpora
tion, after gaining *' majority of the stock,
called epecial meetings of the boards of direct-
PBEARRANGED AFFAIR.
An effort will be made to show that the
latter corporation sent its agents -to San
Francisco, where they bought up a suffi
cient amount of the stock of the different
railroad corporations to give them a ma
jority vote at the meeting of the com
panies and then proceeded, at special
meeting of stockholders, called for that
particular purpose, to vote to the foreign
corporation the holdings of the roads, to
gether with their franchises. In discuss
ing the suit yesterday afternoon Attor
ney Collins said:
Before accepting th!Â» ca*e I looked thoroughly
Into the lawe and fullr satisfied myself that
the contentions cf my clients are well founded
and merit the fullest consideration of the Supe
rior Court. The f=ult will be brought by stock
holders who were never agreeable to the trans
fer of the roads. They believe and always did
believe that the entire transaction was illegal,
and Jt 1* for the purpoM of protecting their
own interert* aÂ» stockholders of the old com
panies, that is, preventing a revocation of the
old franchise*, that they have decided en this
ruit. We have had presented to uÂ« by tho*e
who are inclined to combat our contentions in
thib matter the fact that the last Legislature
immnd an amendment to the State law so as to
legalize the transfer of a local franchise to a
foreign corporation, a change which, I under
stand, i'u made in order to allow the Santa Fe
Company to secure righU of way to the shore
lines of the San Francisco Day.
The deal in the local street railways, how
ever, preceded the adoption of the law cf If)03,
which cannot foe retroactive so as to be ?nade
applicable to the properties Involved in our
case.
The action will be brought in the inter
est of the minority of the old stockholders
of the Market Street Railway Company.
Sutter Street Railway Company and the
Eutro line, and one of the stockholders
of the latter corporation, named Kelley,
Will be used as a plaintiff in the proceed
ings. For grounds for the suit the com
plaint will set forth that the companies
named violated the conditions of their
respective franchises in transferring the
latter over to another corporation. The
plaintiff, for himself and in behalf of
those who are supposed to be associated
Â¦with him in the proceedings, will endea
vor to prove that the United Railroads,
through a foreign corporation known as
the United Railway Investment Company
of New Jersey, acquired possession of the
local roads through unfair and unlaw
ful methods.
-A suit involving the validity of all the
trancactiens of the United Railroads
from the time that it absorbed the local
street railway lines to the Issuance of its
bonds and its assumption of the manage
ment of the great railway system is
about to be instituted in this city. It
was announced yesterday that to-day or
to-morrow an action will be brought in
the Superior Court, requesting the latter
to grant a decree setting aside the sale of
the variors franchises of local railways to
the United Railroads Company and to
adjudge the transaction void and that a
receiver be appointed to operate the lines
concerned until such time as the old com
panies can be reorganized and receive back
the properties which they* formerly con
trolled. For some time financial circles
have been somewhat agitated over re
ports that dissatisfaction prevailed among
many of the old stockholders of the lines
formerly operated under the management
of the Market Street Railway Company,
the Buttrr Street Railway Company and
their respectl\-e adjuncts.
Accompanying these reports were inti
mations that preparations were under
way to bring the matter into court -with a
view cf determining whether or not the
big deal, effected two years ago through
the medium cf the Union Trust Company
of this city and Brown Bros, of New
York, was not contrary to the laws of
the State and wholly irregular. Tester

DOME, July 8, 6:55 A. M. âThe Pope, awakening this morning, did not speak. He was somewhat irritable and it seemed
as though the blankets and other bedclothes were too heavy, so he kicked them off, at the imminent risk of taking a fresh
cold, which would be absolutely fatal. The doctors consider that altogether his Holiness has had a favorable night All is tranquil
at the Vatican. Dr. Lapponi at 6 o'clock had gone to sleep:

to Be Exhumed for
Autopsy.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 7.â Determined to sift
to the bottom the mysterious death of
Colonel William J. Best In San Rafael
last April, Charles S. Best, one of his
sons, went before the Prosecuting Attor
ney of Essex County, New Jersey, in
Newark to-day and made arrangements
to have the body exhumed from the fami
ly plot in the cemetery in Caldwell, N. J.,
so that an autopsy may be made to ascer
tain if death was due to other than natur
al causes.
This will be done to-morrow afternoon
and the family is of the opinion, as out
lined in the son's affidavit sent to the Cal
ifornia authorities, that It will be found
that Colonel Best was killed by an unnec
essary administration of morphine.
Coincident with this action the family
heard some news which came in the na
ture of a surprse. It was that Dr. John
Donald Woods, in whose home in San Ra
fael Colonel Best died, had disappeared
Â¦fronr^ his hotel In Atlantic City, taking
the- woman who posed In California as
his sister, and the little girl, who. she
says, is her daughter. The doctor had
promised to make an explanation In writ
ing to Colonel Best's two sons, telling all
he knew of the causes which led to their
father's death. This was to have been
done to-day, but on Monday night he paid
his bill at the hotel, had his trunks moved
from the house and now is not to be
found.
It has been ascertained that Dr. Woods
has had a remarkable career since he was
pastor of a Methodist church In Port Alle
gheny, Pa. Dismissed from the church
after a conference of ministers had found
him guilty of a charge of having two
wives, he forfeited his bail rather than
stand trial on a criminal charge made by
his first wife. But she is now with him
and it is said that she is the woman who
posed as his widowed sister in San Rafael.
Of Woods* history In various parts of
the country, particularly in the eastern
States, much is told by the head of a de
tective agency In this city which was em
ployed to look into his record.
Woods was accused of offering to swear
falsely |n defense of a Dr. Bllnn, who
was indicted for causing: a woman's death
by malpractice, and asking $1000 for his
testimony. He afterwards confessed that
he offered to give the testimony for a con
sideration. Woods was graduated from a
"wild cat" medical college.
OFFICERS FIND VIALS.
Woods' Former House Searched and
Requisition Will Be Sought.
SAN RAFAEL, July 7.-Detectlves who
have been working on the case of Colonel
W. J. Best of New York City, who died
at the home of John Donald Woods and
Alice Cloy Wood In this city on April 6,
1D03, have made rapid progress, and Dis
trict Attorney Boyd will to-morrow pre
pare the necessary papers asking Gov
enor Pardee to have Woods and Miss
Wocd' brought back to Matin County for
trial.
It has been ascertained that Woods,
who professed to be a physician, pur
chased poisons from local druggists. P.
Inman admitted that he sold Woods
aconite. The authorities to-day unearthed
a case containing several vials, but all
were empty. Analysis, however, proved
that they had contained aconite and other
poisons. This case was hidden away in
the house formerly occupied by Woods.
A hypodermic syringe was also discov
ered.
The officials declare now that Woods
committed perjury on March 20. 190X On
that date Deputy County Clerk Frank
Holland visited his home and registered
him to vote. At that time Woods awore
he was a native of California and a phy
sician. The District Attorney says he
has evidence to prove that Woods Is nei
ther a native of this State nor a physi
cian.
Dr. TV. F. Jones stated to the District
Attorney to-day that during one of his
visits to 729 Fifth avenue, where Woods
resided, and when Colonel Best lay ill,
he noticed that Best showed mo3t peculiar
symptoms. These symptoms, the doctor
asserted, under other circumstances
would have caused him to be particularly
skeptical, but from the fact that he had
been called in at first only as a consulting
physician, and as Woods was at that
time rated as a reputable physician, he
only asked a few questions. Woods told
his associate that he. had noticed the same
symptoms in Best's case during a prior

PORTSMOUTH. England, July 7.-
With the boom of cannon, tho
British fleet, on behalf of King
Edward ( welcomed the United
States European squadron to
Great Britain's naval headquarters this
morning. The gunboat Machias joined the
flagship Kearsarge, the CTUcago and the
San Francisco early in the morning, and
shortly after 8 o'clock signals began to
flutter from the mastheads of" the Ameri
can and British ships. The latter, in obe
dience to a signal from L/ord Charle3
Beresford. the commander of the channel
squadron, formed two lines, and down this
lane of huge gray warships moved the
Americans, their white sides gleaming in
the sunlight.
National salutes were fired by each
squadron, which was followed by an ex
change of salutes to Rear Admiral Cot
ton and Vice Admiral Beresford.
Subsequently the two admirals ex
changed'calls on the -flagships, according
tho usual honors as each came over the
side. V.'<~i
At high tide the American warships
entered the harbor, led by the Kearsarge,
which was moored south of the railroad
jetty and within a stone's throw of Nel
son's old flagship, tne Victory; King Ed
ward's yacht, the Victoria and Albert, and
the battleship f Collingwood. flagship of
Admiral Hotham. the commander in chief
of Portsmouth.
Of the ten men who were fined $100 each
in the Police Court to-day for carrying
concealed weapons nine were negroes.
Tho Grand Jury to-day returned twenty
indictments against rioters. The capiases
have not been served and the namtÂ»3 of
the rioters have not been made public.
Tho indicted are said to be well-known
citizens.
SINISTER THREATS HEARD.
Martial law will not be declared until
there is renewed trouble. General McKee
said to-nizht that it had been reported
that threats were made by leaders of the
rioters when they saw the troops arriving
that they "would net do a thing to those
negroes' protectors"^ before daylight.
The Central Labor Union joined with
the Mayer this afternoon in a proclama
tion urging the citizens to remain in their
hemes to-nieht and maintain order. '.
The negro fin? company has left the city
under advice of the Mayor and its place
in the department has been filled 1 with
white men. The negroes had become so
frightened that they were regarded as un
fitted to perform their duties and were re
lieved from duty at their own request.
The trocps marched through a quiet,
curious crowd of several thousand per
sons. There was not a negro in sight.
In the meantime the Evansville, Terre
Haute and Vincennes companies had gone
into camp, around the Courthouse and
jail, witn sentries and pickets lined out.
No one was, allowed to approach within
Â»00 yards of the jail. General McKee or
dered the Martineville company to relieve
the companies around the Jail for a part
of the night, and the Indianapolis com
panies and the battery went into camp in
Sunset Park, six squares from the Jail.
General McKee, on his arrival this af
ternocn, held a consultation with the
Mayor and a committee of fifteen promi
nent citizens designated by the Mayor as
a committee of safety. At tnia meeting
there wore some expressions of severe
criticism of, the coyrse of Mayor Covert.
Genera! McKee asked for the co-operation
of Sheriff Kratz, but that official tele
phoned from the jail that it would be
death for him to leave the protection of
the troops, and he is still entrenched be
hind the guns of the soldiers and the
walls of the prison. General McKee was
asked by the citizens for all troops possi
ble, and said he could pour 3000 soldiers
into the city before daylight if necessary-.
He said he thought the 400 rifles which
had arrived would be sufficient for all
emergencies.
All saloons were ordered closed at noon,
and the order was obeyed to-night. The
general expression heard in the streets is:
"Wait until the soldiers so away. There
wHJ be trouble again. This thing is not
over yet." .â¢:. ; .- ."
NOT A NEGE0 .IN SIGHT.
EVAXSVILLE. Ir.d.. July 7.â After the
carnage last night Evansville to-night is
obeying the orders of the Mayor and the
residents are keeping off the streets.
Nine persons are dead, one is dying, three
others are fatally wounded and twenty
one more or less injured.
Four died to-dayâ Frank Lamble, aged
2S, shot through the chin and breast;
Fred Kappler, Jacob E. Beck,\ a barber,
shot through the brain, and Charles Tay
lor, a wagonmaker, who was an onlocker
and did not participate in the attack on
the troops, and who was shot in the
back. > .'.,
John Barrett is dying from shot wounds
received from the volley fired into trie
mob and his physicians say he cannot live
till morning. The previously unidentified
dead man has been recognized as Robert
\V. Bock, who was shot in the head dur
ing the volley from the Courthouse de
fenders last night.
Eight companies of militia and one
light battery are in Evansville. The 400
soldiers are armed with rifles, and the
light battery has a Gatling gun. The
Terre Haute company arrived this after
noon and relieved the Vincennes "and
Evansville companies in guarding the
jail. An hour later Brigadier General Mc-
Kee. in command of the Indiana National
Guard, arrived" and assumed command of
the troops. At 8:15 o'clock to-night a spe
cial train arrived, bearing: three compa
nies and a battery of artillery from In
dianapolis; also a company from Martins
ville.
An examination was at once made of
the neighborhood and it was found that in
the direction from which the bullet must
have come there was a high 1 board fence.
In the fence at a point from which the
shot must have been fired was a hole that
had been recently sawed, about four inch
es wide and twelve inches long. This
fence is built across a lot that is very
near the offices of Colonel R. B. Thorn
ton, a local architect and a Southerner
of fiery disposition.
Then it was recalled rnat about six
weeks ago Thornton and Purcell had en
gaged in a light in which Thornton was
pretty badly whipped. The row of six
â¢â¢weeks ago occurred over aome business
differences and Involved in addition to
the two principals, James White, a
brother-in-law of Purcell/ and \V. M.
Richards.
The old trouble, the location of the
fence so near the offices of Colonel Thorn
ton, and all the circumstances seemed to
point to revenge as the motive for the
crime, and a search was made for Thorn
ton. He was found in a nearby saloon,
and was at once put under arrest. In his
pocket was found a revolver, but all of
the chambers were full. He was placed
under arrest, however, and at once sent
to Martinez pending the result of the ex
amination Into Purcell's condition tomor
row. He refused to make a statement.
The shooting occurred at about 9
o'clock. Purcell was on his way home
and had just turned from Jtichmond ave
nue into Tunnel avenue when a pistol
shot rang out and Purcell dropped with a
bullet in his back just under the left
shoulder. When Purcell fell it is pre
sumed that the man who fired the shot
was satisfied that he had accomplished
his object, and did not want to take the
risk of attracting more attepiKm by
shooting a second time.
The sound' of the shot brought several
people to the scene and Purcell was taken
in charge by a physician. An examina
tion failed to locate the bullet. The
doctors said that the wound was extreme
ly serious, but prognosis could not bo
advanced until a more complete examina
tion was made.
POINT RICHMOND, July 7.-A shoot
ing occurred here to-night that has many
of "the cowardly aspects of a Kentucky
feud. Frank Purcell, proprietor of a trans
fer company, was syiously wounded in.
the back by an assassin, concealing him
self behind a high board fence before fir
ing the shot. A hole was found sawed
in the fence at Just the right height to
permit a man standing behind the fence
to shoot accurately and fear of
being seen. Colonel R. B. Thornton, an
architect and a Southerner, is now in tho
Martinez County Jail, suspected of hav

BERLIN, July 7.â The
Boursen Courier says
that zvhen the Em
peror received nezvs of the
Pope's critical condition,
aboard the Hohenzollern, he
said :
"The Pope, whom I
know, love and revere, is in
danger; let us pray for
him."
Then, during divine ser

simple, impressive prayer,
concluding :
"The world needs great

Much significance is attached to an extended visit .made by
Cardinal Gotti, Prefect of the Propaganda, to the Pope's 'cham
ber, from whicn other conspicuous members of the^; Sacred Â¦ Col
lege are excluded by the doctor's orders. Cardinal Gotti's inter
view lasted twenty minutes, even the doctors, and, attendants with
drawing and leaving him alone with' the Pope. This has- natur
ally opened a wide field of speculation. It is even asserted on the
authority of one Cardinal that Pope Leo expressed -the hope that
in the event of succession falling on Cardinal Gotti he might have
the strength to take up and carry forward the great work just con
fided to him. Just what passed between the Pontiff, and Cardinal
Gotti, onlythey know, but certainly the/ circumstances and the
length of, the visit- strongly support the view that the Pope was
"I do not dare to say anything positive: . It is ( very easy ..to be

the Pope will die, but I do not believe death will occur -yet."-
Cardinal Gotti Confers With Leo.
giving his attention to the administration of the affairs of the
church after his death.
Throughout yesterday a constant stream of visitors besieged
the entrance to the Vatican. The guards at the portals kept back
the merely curious, admitting only diplomats accredited to the Vat
ican and high dignitaries. Among the diplomatists were the Min
isters of Russia and Prussia, the Embassadors of Spain, Austria
and Portugal, and the Charge d' Affaires for Brazil. The French
Embassador, M. Nisard, has shown, deep interest in the reports
from the sick room. He remained after midnight yesterday, and
was again at the Vatican this morning.
Among the Cardinals krriving were Gennaro, Nocella, Ma
thieu, Respigi, Casetta, Oretoni and Gotti. It was remarked that
Cardinal Oreglia, the dean of the Sacred College, was not among
the callers, although it is expected that he soon will be called upon,
to perform the most important services of the interregnum.
Though not calling personally, Cardinal Oreglia thrice dispatch
ed his secretary, Father Santo, ta learn the exact condition of the
Pontiff. None of the visiting Cardinals except Cardinal Gotti saw
the Pope, owjng to the rigid dir-ections of the doctors that the pa

Â«yv OME. July 7.â In the midst of all
JfJ of the anxiety regarding the health
the Pope, there is much talk
at the Vatican regarding â¢ the determina
tion expressed by Cardinal Mathfeu to
claim for France her right to exercise her
high patronage over the conclave, a right
which she has enjoyed in spite of all the
discussions to which it has given rise.
This pretension on the part cf Cardinal
Mathieu explains why he refused to leave
the Vatican.
Cardinal Capecelatro also has a small
group of Independent partisans and may
succeed because the sacred college ob
jects to another long pontificate.
'f^ ~" rF: - July 7.â One of the Vatican
JLJ prelates assured a correspondent
this evening that the contest for
the succession to Pope Leo lay between
Cardinals Gottl, the prefect of the sacred
congregation, and Vannutelli, grand pen
itentiary of the holy Catholic church.
Cardinal Rampolla, the papal secretary
of state, has only a ellght chance. He
will be supported by only a few new car
dinals, who. In order to prevent the elec
tion of Cardinal Gottl or Cardinal Van
nutelli, may vote for the octegenarian,
Cardinal Alphonsus Capecelatro, Arch
bishop of Capua, whose pontificate would
necessarily be short and would afford an
other chance for Cardinal Rampolla.

The doctors remained by the Pope's
side, noting the regularity of his breath

From a pathological standpoint, the
passage of air was considered satisfac
tory, in the physical relief which it
brought to the Pope. He showed a slight
Fmile on his pallid face, whispered his
thankfulness and bestowed benedictions
on the doctors bending over him. The
Pontiff even stroked Dr. Mazzoni's face
in the benevolent way which is charac

rearranged his position, closed his eyes
and in a few moments passed into a
calm, healthful sleep.
The Pope manifested no pain whatever,
neither was there the slightest quiver
of moral dread from the operation. In
the language of one of the doctors, the
cocaine so deadened the parts that
the Pontiff felt no more than a slight
pin-prick.
As soon as the liquid was drawn off
by the suction needle the patient felt
great relief, owing to the removal of the
pressure of the liquid on the lung, and
simultaneously the doctors could hear
air passing through that zone which this
morning was declared to be impervious,
ov.ing to congestion.
First a slight incision was made in the
side of the venerable patient. A solution
of alcohol and corrosive sublimate was
then injected and cocaine -was used to
deaden the pain. The point of operation
was just below the seventh rib and the
operation itself consisted in the insertion
of a large Pravaz needle syringe. This
penetrated to the region where the mat
ter had accumulated and by means of
suction slowly drew it off. Under the
skillful guidance of Dr. Mazzoni the op
eration occupied little more than four
minutes.
As the operation was not of a capital
nature, not suggesting the use of chlor
oform or other anesthetics, the Pope
lay on his bed, with his left side exposed
below the armpit to the waist. Only the
two doctors and two personal attendants
were within the chamber. The immedi
ate direction of the operation devolved
upon Dr. Mazzoni, who handled the in
struments and made the preparatory ar
rangements.
Y^ OME, July 7.â The calmness with
mÂ£ which the Pope underwent the or
Â¦* deal of to-day's operation was one
cf the most remarkable evidences of for
titude that he had given in his whole life.
After a lengthy conference the doctors
concluded it was advisable to operate for
pleurisy, the primary purpose being to
explore the affected parts. They hoped
incidentally to draw off the collected fluid.
Patient Comments
Upon Doctors'
Bulletins.
The happy and cheerful expression of
the Pontiff at the moment when he was
in the \*ery shadow of death astonished
the doctors. The Pope himself seems to
irfory in his ability to present a calm and
bright demeanor, and particularly asked
the doctors to tell people about the state
of his mind. Accordingly the doctors have
freely discussed the cheerfulness of the
venerable patient, repeating the details
of his <ju!ck sallies as showing the activ
ity of his mind.
â^ OME, June R, 2 a. m.â The mar-
W ~% vclous vitality and recuperative
M^P energy of the Pope were never so
/\ forcibly demonstrated vs by the
sories of events preceding, accom
panying and following yesterday's opera
tion. Since morning, when first informed
*hat the operation would perhaps be per
formed, his Holiness began to Inquire
about it. Turning to Dr. Lapponi with
his usual familiarity, he asked:
"Will it be painful? Remember, I can
not stand much pain."
Instead of Dr. Lapponi Dr. Mazzoni
answered: "I can asure your Holiness
that you will feel no pain. A little co
caine will deaden all sensation."
Pope Leo retorted at once: "Remem
ber you said the same thing when you
extracted that cyst a few years ago."
Dr. Mazzoni replied: "That operation
went very well, but this can hardly be
callrd an operation."
* The Pope then concluded: "Then do
whatever you think best."
JESTS WITH THE SURGEONS.
When the operation took place nobody
was allowed in the room besides the doc
tors except Pope Leo's valet, Pio Centra;
"even his nephew. Count Camillo Pecci,
left the room to await with extreme
anxiety in an adjoining hall the result.
The doctors, desiring a strong light, had
ihe window widely opened, but as it
'faces the bed the light offended the weak
eyes of the Pontiff so that it was thought
<1rsirable that he should reverse his po
sition. As soon as this was announced
the P<^x> moved, showing that spirit of
action and determination which seems
constantly to inspire him. Dr. Mazzoni.
however, did not give him time to leave
the bed. but. taking him in his arms lit
erally turned the Pontiff about. Pope
Leo smiled and exclaimed:
"Bravo, professor. I congratulate you.
Although I have become so light, I must
Ftill be rather heavy-"
Both of the doctors laughed and were
at the tame time astonished at the
brightness of the Pontiff when oppressed
by such a dangerous illness and on the
point of undergoing a surgical operation.
Pope Leo remained Fit ling up in bed
during the whole time of the operation,
without n^ed of support. When Dr. Maz
zoni substituted the Pravaz needle with
a potain aspirator the Pope did not even
notice it. going through the whole affair
without emitting the slightest sound and
wjthout showing any feeling of pain. He
was extremely pale, almost diaphanous,
and somewhat tremulous.
As soon a? the operation was closed his
Holiness felt much relieved. His eye.
from an expression of languid melan
choly, assumed its usual vivacity, illumi
nating the rmacir.ted face. Dr. Mazzoni
at once administered a cordial, which
the Pontiff took willingly, thanking him
Â¦with a grateful look for the brave strug
gle (o preserve his life. He expressed a
. deeir* 5 for a minute explanation of the
apparatus eaed in the operation.
"It is a most ingenious instrument," he
said, ""but voi:r hand is also bo very
clever. That is why the operation was
Â¦imniwful In not giving me any pain. I
thank you."
ASKS TO SEE BULLETINS.
After a half hour's peaceful and appa
rently refreshing repose the Pope awoke
and inquired about the doctors. On hear
ing they were in the next room he said:
"I thought they had gone. What do
they stay here for? What are they plot
ting?"
Dr. Lapponi. re-entering the room, said:
"We were preparing bulletins regarding
!th<? operation, saying it was successful in
all respects."
Dr. Mazzoni added: "We must inform
the public, which is waiting with such
Trepidation, especially as it is so easy to
have inexact news spread."
"Very well," rep!ied his Holiness, "I
(wish to see myself these bulletins in their
exact text. I have already seen and medi
tated on that of last night."
He thrn went on sprakine about the
cause of his illness. "I would like to
know." he said, "from what it comes. I
think I huve always followed Dr. Lap
poni's advice,"
"Not always, your Holiness," replied Dr.
Lapponi. gently.
"Well," retorted Pope Leo < "you could
not expect to remedy my old age."
After a short silence the Pope, turning
to Dr. Mazzoni. paid:
"At the last consistory I appointed as a
Cardinal a fellow citizen of yours, Cardi
â¢ Sl Taliani. who comes from the Marches.
1Â» you know him?"
"Yes, your Holiness, I know him. I hope
that will not be your last consistory."
"I am afraid so," sighed the Pope, sad
ly, after which his head fell upon the pil
low, the Pope being again the prey of
exhaustion.

tle or no hope for Pope Leo's re
covery is entertained at the papal
legation in this city. Monseignor
Falconio, the personal representative of
the Pope to the United States, tele
graphed to Acting Papal Delegate Mon
seignor Marchetti here to-day from De
troit that he would leave there to-night
and arrive here to-morrow afternoon.
Cable dispatches are received at the papal
legation at regular intervals from Car
dinal Rampolla, papal secretary of state,
giving the latest news from the Vatican
regarding the condition of the Pope. Mon
seignor Marchctti received the following
cablegram this morning at 9:30 o'clock:
"ROME, July 7.â The holy father is no
worse to-day. Condition continues very
serious, without, however, making us loaa
every hope.
(Signed) "CARDINAL RAMPOLLA.
"Secretary of State."
The papal legation is a very modest
dwelling house. Just now there is an al
most constant stream of callers from
members of the Catholic clergy, members
of the faculty of the Catholic University
and the Catholic laiety. Monsignor Mar
chetti, acting papal delegate, is not able
to extend any comforting information to
solicitous inquirers. Monsignor Marchctti
is personally deeply affected by the seri
ous advices from Rome, as he was 'onÂ©
of the favorites of Pope Leo and had
his last conference with the Pope shortly
before being assigned to the legation here
from Rome. \ ,'.
DIPLOMATS SHOW CONCERN.
Members of the diplomatic corps In the
capital, especially those representing
Latin countries and governments where
the Roman Catholic church is the repre
sentative church, are deeply concerned
and are among the most anxious callers
at the papal legation. Many tributes are
heard here from diplomats regarding
Pope Leo's great services to the world
as a peacemaker between nations and as
a diplomati3t. Among the diplomats are
a number who enjoy a personal acquaint
ance with the Pope.
At the Catholic University of which
Monsignor O'Connell is rector, a feeling of
depression and hopelessness prevails.
The demise of the Pope at this time
would seriously affect the Catholic Uni
versity. Monsignor O'Connell is now on
Ms way to Rome with new and broader
plans for the Catholic University, which
were to have been submitted to Pope
Leo for his approval. The latter has al
ways expressed deep personal interest
In the development and work of the
Catholic University established here,
which has at the head of its board of
trustees his Eminence Cardinal Gibbons,
and which embraces leading dignitaries
of . the Catholic Church of the country.
Recently a congregation of studies was
incorporated with the work of the Cath
olic University and the scope of the in
stitution Is to be materially broadened.
CHURCH BELLS WILL TOLL.
Tentative plans have already been pre
pared for the observance of the Pope'a
funeral In the capital. This city is un
der the jurisdiction of Cardinal Gibbons,
who Is reported to be prepared to leave
at a moment's notice for Rome in the
event of Pope Leo's death, in order to
take part in the conclave of the college
of cardinals which will select Pope Leo's
successor. As soon as news is received
that the condition of the Pope has taken
a fatal conclusion all Catholic church
bells will peal forth the sad tidings and
mass will be held.
No predictions are volunteered here as
to the successor of Pope Leo, although
opinions are divided as to the chances of
Cardinal Rampolla, Cardinal Gottl and
Cardinal Satolli.

tons of rock and dirt that filled the
mouth of the tunnel.
At 1:30 o'clock a "force of five miners
was at work in tunnel No. 3 on the thir

that was plainly heard throughout the
underground workings of the big mine
an immense body of ore and dirt fell and
completely penned in the miners. The
news of the accident soon spread through
the camp and a hundred men with picks

dug before to rescue their comrades. The
rock and dirt that obstructed the tunnel
was loose and enabled the Imprisoned
men to be faintly heard by the rescuers.

ket street, as has already been said, the
distance in a straight line is thirteen
miles. Point Richmond, where the pres
ent bay terminus of the Santa Fe Is situ
ated, is eight miles f/om the union ferry
building. A line from Coyote Point Is
only about five miles longer than the
route from Point Richmond to the foot
of Market street. This difference Is off
set many times by the saving of forty-five
miles by the; way of San Jose to San
Francisco, as compared with the Stock
ton-Point Richmond line of , travel.
On all points concerning the Identity. of
the. Dartles back of. the extensive opera
tions in. San >Mateo. County. that are de
tailed in the. foregoing, C. W. Clark main
tains an absolute silence. What trans
continental, system is to occupy the hew
deep water terminal at Coyote Point and
operate the lines % that lead out toward
an advantageous . overland connec t ipn to
the south, via San Jose or Santa Cruz, he
will not say.
Framing 1 Materials.
The electric railway from San Mateo to
Spanishtown will follow a route eleven
miles long, so says Mr. Clark. The steam
freight and Â¦ passenger line will be 20.5
miles long, from Coyote Point to
Spanishtown. There are . some grades
to overcome, but no' engineering
difficulties. A splendid and produc
tive country will be penetrated for the
first time by lines of travel. There will
be one or possibly two tunnels for the
steam passenger and freight line, but
probably none for the electric passenger
railway.
The route of the steam road, starting
from Coyote Point, will run southerly,
crossing the tracks of the Southern Pacific
Company near Laurel Creek. Then It will
pass up the Laurel Creek Canyon over a
two per cent grade and then across the
ridge between Laurel Creek and the poor
house road. Thence the line leads along
the poorhouse road and continues to the
easterly Bhore of the Crystal Springs res
ervoirs. With a slight grade the line Is
surveyed to go around the south end of
the Crystal Springs reservoirs. From
there the route is over a gradual ascent,
the grade being about two per cent, trend-
Ing northerly and climbing the main ridge
very close to the county road that leads
over to Halfmoon Bay.
At this point a tunnel will be driven
through the divide near the, summit and
close to the county road. Then there will
be a gradual descent to the floor of the
canyon that runs up from Halfmoon Bay.
This furnishes an easy . and . good ap
proach to Halfmoon Bay or Spanishtown.
AN ELECTRIC LINE.
The line of the electric road differs
somewhat from that of the steam rail
way, the variation being caused by the
greater ease with which an electric pas
senger line can run over grades as com
pared to a steam line built for heavy
traffic. The electric road is projected to
6tart westerly from Coyote Point to and
through the town of San Mateo. Then
the route Is along the private roads con
trolled by the Bowie estate to the summit
dividing the valley from San Mateo
Creek valley. Thence the road proceeds
over the summit into the San Mateo
Creek valley, crossing the same near the
fork of the road that goes up to the
poorhouse. The line next follows along
the poorhouse road, passes the poor farm
and swings around to the west, crossing
the dam separating the two lakes of the
Crystal Springs. From here the route
slopes upward, gradually ; rising to tlie
main divide at about the same locality
aa the point selected for the passing vt
the steam road. Then the descent Is into
the canyon that leads directly to Spanish
town. The electric road can be construct
ed without any heavy cuts or fills, al
though the grade will be heavier than
that of the steam line..
The accompanying map, which is traced
from the actual surveys of both the elec
tric and steam' railways, Indicates suffi
ciently the routes selected, and the section
of country, through which the two lines
will 'pads. Betow Spanishtown there is a
slight tracing of *a spur, which is ; in
tended to show where .the extension of
the steam road toward Santa .Cruz and
possibly farther southward will run. Â¦
From Coyote Point to the foot. of Mar-
Seme franchises are secured, so admits
C. W. Clark, and some are soughf. That
between San Mateo and Coyote Point has
been granted. A franchise will be sought
in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties to
peimit of the construction of lines from
San Mateo to Halfmoon Bay and down
the coast as far, at least, as Santa Cruz,
and possibly farther south.
SURVEYS OF ROUTES.
Point at^the de^p water terminal will be
started at once.
Among transportation men who have
thoroughly studied the local railway sit
uation as related to the overland railways
there Is belief -that the coming of the
Santa Fe via San Jose .Is inevitable and
only a matter of time, the only cloud on
this prospect being that the Southern Pa
cific management, ever keenly alive to its
Â«wn interests, might find it to .Its* advan
tage to prevent its rival from having com
petitive rail lines on this side of the bay
of San Francisco. Whatever may be the
back of the terminal* just ac
quired at Coyote Point and the rail line
surveys and rights of way 'acquired, the
indications are most Interesting.
Coyote Point Is but two miles from the
town of Ban Mateo. Between San Mateo
and the coast line the country is flat, so
that very little grading Is required. Taken
from all aspects, the selection of the point
as a deep water terminal Is prompted by
care for the promotion of a great busi
ness, such as no merely local line would
have to provide for. On the best of au
thority It Is learned that the project im
mediately Involves the construction of
both an electric passenger railway from
Coyote Point to Spanishtown, or Half
moon Bay, and also of a steam | passenger
and freight railway .between â¢ the
points. The construction of tho steam
railway line from San Mateo to Coyote
Strengthening this belief are many
facts. One is' that the Santa Fe has had
a line surveyed from the San Joaquin
Valley over into the Santa Clara Valley
and has secured rights of way that would
lead it into San Jose whenever it is de
termined by the management to make
that move forward. It is also learned
that, via San Jose, the Santa Fe would
have a line forty-five miles shorter to
San Francisco than the one now used by
way of Stockton and Point Richmond.
Another fact Is that the business of the
Santa Fe is mainly south of San Fran
cisco and it would be a measure of econ
omy to come in from the south. When
the construction of the San Joaquin Val
ley road was first discussed the advant
ages of a route via San Jose were recog
nized.
frontage'and but thirteen miles
from (he foot of Market street, railroad
moves are being made that may mean
much for this city and likewise for the
development of a rich, virgin country.
Surveys have been made for an electric
line and for a steam railway. Aiding the
scheme is known to be C. W. Clark, son
of Stnatcr Clark of Montana, who is al
ready largely identified with railway con
struction on the Pacific Coastâ in the
States of Utah, Nevada and California.
C. W. Clark admits that he is concerned
in the new system that makes Its initial
appearance in this section entirely In San
Mateo County. Beyond this avowal Mr.
Clark will go no further. Plainly the en
terprise with which he is prominently
connected is more than a mere local af
fair. The terminal acquired is a tract of
fifty-six acres fronting on tidewater.
One. hundred and fifty yards from the
present shore line the water is deep
enough to float the largest ship in exis
tence. The situation is so chosen as to
form a first rate outlet for a transcon
tinental railway, coming In by way of the
peninsula, through San Jose. From this
and other circumstances it is conjectured
that back of the scheme is the Santa
Fe, planning to enter San Francisco on
a parity with the Southern Pacific.

MADE IN SAN MATEO COUNTY; ALSO SHOWING THE PRESENT TERMINI ON THE BAY OF SAN FRANCIS

It is said that the charge arose from
voung Baird calling upon his folks at
their Pacific avenue home and during a
wordy war with his sister, striking a
younger brother who tried to interfere.
Baird acknowledged this fact, but said
he had been drinking. At the request of
Attorney Brown the court made the fol
lowing order:
"On motion of I. I. Brown, counsel for
David J. Baird. said Brown appearing
in open court and after full investigation
and good cause appearing therefore, the
court being fully advised in the premises,
it is ordered that the order of arrest
heretofore issued against David J. Baird,
as an alleged insane person be, and the
Fame is hereby vacated, set aside and
declared of no force and effect and the
proceedings involving the same are here
by quashed and dismissed. Done in open
court. Frank J. Muraskv."
This was done at the urgent request
of Attorney 1. 1. Brown, who represents
the wealthy young man. It will be re
membered that on May 29 the relatives of
Baird attempted to have htm taken Into
custody on a charge of Insanity in order
to get him away from the influence of
a notorious woman in this city. Baird
had been traveling a merry pace In the
""Tenderloin" and his sister feared that
he would squander his fortune and un
dermine his health. He went Into hiding
the moment he heard the police were
looking for him. His attorney got wind
of the affair and he spirited his client
away and foiled the detectives. As soon
as Baird was himself, the attorney noti
fied the sister that he did not intend to
have such a serious charge hanging over
the head of his client. He therefore
pave notice that he would have Baird
in court yesterday and have him exam
ined in the presence of the court.
The sister failed to materialize. In fact
no one Interested appeared to try to
prove that Baird was of unsound mind.
Attorney Brown presented the matter to
the court and Judge Murasky was satis
fied. Brown said it was an outrage to
accuse the young man of being insane,
when there was no cause for it. He in
sinuated that there was another reason
for the charge.
David J. Baird need no longer remain
in hiding for fear cf being arrested on a
charge of being an Insane person. Judge
Murasky yesterday declared that young
Baird was in possession of his senses
and quashed the order heretofore made
in the matter.

$20 cash bail and when the cases were
called before Police Judge Conlan he con
tinued them for two weeks, as Teuten

pant of two front rooms in the home of
Teutenberg's mother at 602 McAllister

to the effect that he had moved across

pulled down the sign. Schord put the sign
up again and claims that Teutenberg saw

Cromwell has received a cablegram
from Bogota stating that the treaty was
presented to the Colombian Senate July

tion July. 4. As. less than two weeks re
main of the special session of the Colom
bian Congress, It is apprehended here that
the treaty cannot receive final action in

OYSTER BAY, N. Y., July, 7.â Secretary
of State John Hay is a guest of Presi
dent Roosevelt to-night at Sagamore HUH
Matters of grave importance to this coun
try in its international relations were
under consideration during the. afternoon
and evening.
The conclusions reached at the con
ference were not disclosed, both tho
President and Secretary Hay regarding it
as inexpedient at this time to discuss for
publication the details of their work. To
two subjects of serious concern most of
their attention was turned. They con
sidered in all its phases the Russian sit
uation." particularly with respect to thc
B'nai B'rith petition, which it has been
determined will be forwarded to the Rus
*sian GoVernment, and the Alaskan bound
ary question which next month Is to bo
taken up for what is hoped may be final
adjustment by the American and British
commission in London.
President Roosevelt discussed with Sec
retary Hay and Senators Fairbanks, Han
na and Kearns the Alaskan boundary
matter. Senator Fairbanks was a mem
ber of the joint high commission which
had that question under discussion sev
eral years ago, and the Senator and
President took this opportunity to go over
the matter. It is understood the papers
in the American cause have been made up
and the case Is ready for presentation.
Secretary Root, Senator Lodge of Massa
chusetts and former Senator Turner of
Washingtonâ the American members ot
the commissionâ will leave for England in
the course of a month to begin the actual
work of the commission in London.
Soon after Senator Hanna and his party

President and Secretary Hay continued
their! conference until far into the night.
It was noted as a bit significant that they
should begin their conference on the. very
day the Russian Embassador, Count Cas
sini,V sailed for home, j It Is regarded aa
likely: that some developments in the
Russian situation may be expected In a
few; days.

United States Immigrant Commissioner
Hart H. North received yesterday from
Secretary Cortelyou of the United States
Department of Commerce and Labor, a
letter designating him "officer in charge
of the enforcement of the Chinese exclu
sion laws at the port of San Francisco,
superseding the Collector of Customs at
that port, so far as Chinese matters are
concerned." A letter from Frank P. Sar
gent, Commissioner-General of Immigra
tion, was also received and in It the fol
lowing announcement was made:
"You have Immediate jurisdiction over
all the officers, employes, watchmen, etc.,
now on duty there who are part of the
immigration service and paid from the
appropriations under control of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor."
Commissioner North feels highly hon
ored at the distinction conferred upon
him, but as he will be obliged to abandon
his law practice without any increase of
salary for the new honors thrust upon
him, he feels that he has undertaken the
care of a white elephant.

JAPANESE STATESMAN WHO MAT BE ASKED TO FORM NEW CABI
NET; PREMIER WHO HAS TENDERED HIS RESIGNATION, AND
CHINESE OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF AIDING RUSSIA. .
Judge Murasky has set the latter part
of August for the hearing of the petition
to reopen the, case. ' Mr.' Paxton is at
present in Sonoma. A copy of the petition
was served on him yesterday and he
hastened to deny the sensational charges
made against him. He admits that he
has been separated from his wife and that
he has no tender feelings for her, nor she
for him. He says the charges she makes
in her petition are libelous and untrue
and that it is another attempt on her
part to extort money from him.
He says that at the time of the separa
tion he offered to give her half his for
tune, which amounted to $25,000, but she
declined. She demanded $50,000 from his
fatner, but the latter declined to give her
that sum. At the time Â» of the divorce
Paxton says he gave her $7500 and agreed
to pay $100 a month for the maintenance
of her children until both became of age.
He says the mother, seeing that the chil
dren will soon be of age and she will have
no hold on him, has taken this means of
getting money from him: â¢
Defendant has ignored the appeals of his
children and each of them from time to time,
for some little assistance, while during all of
Fald period of time paid Blitz W. Paxton has
lived In luxury and surrounded with alt the
comforts which come from wealth. That said
defendant is now, and for a long period of time
prior hereto, has been president of a bank in
Sonoma County.
IGNORES APPEALS.
In the meantime the defendant has Inher
ited a larse fortune upon the death of his
mother, and petitioner Is informed and be
lieves that much of the lar*e fortune which
was eo bequeathed to defendant herein by his
mother was so bequeathed on account of a se
cret understanding had between said Blitz W.
Paxton and his mother, after the death of his
father. In order that said defendant Blitz "W.
Paxton could cover up his financial means and
property and live In luxury and surrounded by
the comforts of wealth while his wife and two
children suffered In penury and want. That so
hardened to all that is just and right has Blitz
W. Paxton been to the needs of his wife and
children that appeals of his blind boy John for
a little pocket money and the luxury of an at
tendant for a few hours a day for a few> weeks.
In order that he could enjoy a little outing,
have met with no response.
She alleges she obtained a decree of di
vorce and that her husband promised to
support and educate her ' children, but
failed to do so. and that she has been
compelled to go upon the stage in order to
support her children. The petition fur
ther states:
answer it. She claims that when her son
John was 11 years old he met with an ac
cident and suffered the loss of his' eye
sight. The petitioner further states that
on March 10. 1S94, she sued her husband
for maintainance and not for divorce;
that he had the case transferred to Sono
ma and by "fraud, deceit and false and
untrue statements" he succeeded in get
ting her to drop her suit and commence
a suit for divorce.
During those years, she says, she had
lived upon the charity of her relatives;
that after the birth of her daughter she
telegraphed her husband that she was
coming home and he replied not to come,
as he would join her at Rochester: that
instead of doing so he sailed for Panama
within twenty-four hours and for seven
years traveled at leisure and for pleasure
throughout the world and represented
himself a slnule man.
Mrs. Paxton then states that she had
to provide for herself and children by
singing in oratorio. She alleges that upon
ascertaining the address pi her husband
she wrote him a loving and wifely letter
begging him to return, but he failed to
TRAVELS FOR PLEASURE.
She charges her ex-husband with all
eorts of things and demands that the di
vorce proceedings be reopened in order
that sne may receive alimony and gain
possession of silverware valued at $500,
which she alleges is withheld by Paxton.
The petition states that they were mar
ried on July 2G, 1SS2. She states that after
the birth of her child, John A. Paxton,
she went to her father's home in Roches
ter, X. Y.,*and, although she begged her
husband to accompany her, de declined.
She alleges that drugs he compelled her
to take wrecked her health and 'caused
her great suffering'. The petitioner states
that her second child, Roma Warren Pax
ton, was born in 1S84, and that both chil
dren are living.
She further alleses that from Septem
ber, 1S84, until the following year her hus
band failed to send her money and that
she was forced to live on her' relatives.
She said she did not see her husband until
Roma was 8 years old. ..

A case, has recently come to light that proves the
example of Washington to be still a vital force
among his countrymen. Judge O. P. Shiras of the
Federal bench for the Northern District of Iowa, is
about to resign after a quarter century's service as
THE Civil War is long past. It survives in mem
ory, and in the lessening legion of veterans and
the lengthening pension list. It is not unusual
to hear defense of the country put on a dollar and
cent basis. In numerous cases this is right, be
cause the fortunes of men arc unequal. While all
owe the same allegiance to the Government, some
can afford to pay their debt to their country in one
way and some in another.
Washington set for his countrymen many useful
examples. One was his refusal to receive any com
pensation either for his military or civil service to
his country. From the time the Continental Con
gress voted to him the chief command until he sur
rendered his sword and his commission to Mifflin,
President of that Congress, in Annapolis, which was
then the capital of. the United States, he took not
a shilling of pay from his country. Nor did he draw,
any salary for. his eight years' service as President.
Now he did not mean by this that all men should
serve their country free in war and in peace. But
he did mean that when a man's fortune, being the
fruit of his country's laws and institutions permit
ting opportunity for his energy, warrants, he may
with credit and honor give his sen-ice to his country
free, in payment of his debt. Such ah act is highly
honorable and reflects no discredit upon others
whose, circumstances forbid the following of the
Washingtonian example.

As "Yankee Doodle" was a musical vagrant, to
which some foolish and fantastic words were sung,
and was picked up out of the gutter for revolution
ary purposes by our sires in 1776, we have an equal
right to take "Hot Time'* wherever we find it and
make a national air of it. One thing is certain no
man can hear it without feeling a smile crawl down
his back. No doubt the new music for "America"
will be fine, but of necessity it must be a somber,
heroic tune, not intended to tickle our patriotic ribs,
bet to make us want to go out and die on the field
of battle, glory in view, leaving a collection of last
words to posterity. "Hot Time" makes us want to
make it interesting for the other fellow.
row-raising tune is Professor Edouard, a~German, not
yet a naturalized riti/en, but represented as a good
American and wholly interested in this country. He
says the tun? :s American and cannot be traced back- 1
ward ir.to the Old World.
"A Thousand Years. My Own Columbia," to Mrs.
Howe's "Battle Hymn" and "Marching Through
Georgia." American music did not get back to where
it was when "Dixie" was born until it struck the
earth and became earthy in ragtime and Coon songs.
Then it gained vigor and vim, and though the classi
cal musicians deplore and deprecate andÂ»vie\v with
alarm these attempts to tune human laughter and set
happiness to music, and point with pride to tears,
misery and crime set to harmony, it is evident that
the smile has been put into music to stay.
One classicist in Chicago appreciates this and is of
the opinion that we are just old enough now to pick
out a national air. Indeed he believes this is already
done and that "There'll Be a Hot Time" is the one.
It was played at San Juan and Santiago, and on
Dcwey's flagship at the battle of Manila. It wel
comed home every returning regiment of volunteers
from the Spanish war, having already sped their de
parture and put life and mettle in their heels on the
march and in battle. The Chicago friend of this
I? it Â«ear enough to the Fourth of July to discuss
art eminently patriotic and tuneful matter. It
is announced that some one has invented a new
tune lor the national hymn. "America." That is well
as far as it goes. We have been singing the na
tional hymn to "God Save the King" so long that
Americans traveling in Great Britain and being un
aware of the pedigree of the tune have felt flattered in
the belief that their musical and mannerly cousins
were serenading them with their own Yankee tune.
The "Star-Spangled Banner" stirs us all to a high
impulse of patriotism, but it is not an American
tune. It has been an immigrant from some part of
Italy, and troubadoured around through Germany
and France, gaining something and losing something,
before we picked it up and pinned it to the flag,
using Key's stirring verses for that purpose.
Though we sing "America" to the British national
air, the British can't complain because we borrow it
from them, for they borrowed it from Germany, and
it is so ancient that perhaps its harmony was chanted
in deep bass by the hardy Northmen at their bulls
head feasts, when they were full of beef, beer and
battle. "Britannia Rules the Wave" and our own
"Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean," arc tunes so old
that the morning stars may have sung them, or
they might have been hummed "when Music, heav
enly maid, was young," and by that lyric young lady
herself.
It is nothing against a tune that it is old. This
generation does not hear "Barbara Allen," "Susan
nah. Don't You Cry," "Lucy Xeal" and the airs that
made their grandparents weep in that solemn and
Calvinistic period of music when it* office was re
garded as a mournful function to make folks feel
bad. It is weil that American composers* did not
get out their thoroughbass and counterpoint in those
days and proceed to construct a national air, for
it would inevitably have been like "Roslyn Castle,"
the "Dead March in Saul" or some other dirge.
We were just coming out of that weeping stage of
music when the Civil War came on, and the process
was unfortunately interrupted. Music put off her
crape and wiped her weeping eyes and gave us that
distinctly American lilt. "Dixie." It was comjposed
and first heard in the North, but was adopted as a
Southern air early in the war, so that when our
brass bands bombarded the rebel ranks with "Amer
ica" they fired back with "Dixie." For a long time
that ti-.ne stood alone. We went into war lyrics ex
tensively. The South had that mournful and inac
curate air, "My Maryland." and the North went
through muÂ«ical evolution, from "Tenting on the Old
Camp Ground." "The Vacant Chair," "Put Me Down,
but Save the Flag," "Nicodemus," "Old Shadv" and

The minor reasons for the reduced crop
are the series of dry years, the better
paying garden truck, to which many
farmers have turned their attention, and
the larger prices paid for sugar beets In
The principal reason is that California
beet farmers have not irrigated their
crops, fearing the effect of the water on
the quality of the beet. In Utah ami
Colorado, however, irrigation has beer
tried with success. It waa found there
that while the portion of sugar per ton
of beets was somewhat decreased the crop
of brets was increased fifty per cent,
which was more than enough to cover the
loss in sugar. A good many California
beet men propose to try irrigation this
year and Professor Shaw is helping them
to find the best way to irrigate.
George W. Shaw, professor of agricul
tural chemistry at the University of Cali
fornia, gave some reasons to-day why the
sugar beet crop of California has declined
in volume this year, thus explaining the
statement made in a bulletin a short
time ago that Michigan would this year
go into the first rank as- a. sugar-produc
ing State, a position that California has
held for the last thirty years.

One of the most interesting features of the report
is the statement of the Comptroller of the Currency
that during the fiscal year 537 new national banks were
organized, and that 339 of them have approximately a
capital of $25,000 each. The small' banks have been
established in places having a population of less than
3000. It is true that all of them are not strictly
speaking new banks, for upward of 42 per cent of the
total number are conversions of State or private banks
into banks operating under the national bank law, but
Still the number of newly established banks is suffi
cient to show that good progress is being made in
the direction of providing sipall towns and rural com T
munities with banking facilities not~1iitherto cn
- The whole report can be' read with satisfaction by
every citizen, and'must be a matter at once of admira
tion and envy to European financiers." It shows that
Uncle Sam's revenues are so ample that even when
he repeals taxes he cannot reduce them to the extent
estimated by. experts, and. every year our statesmen
have to wrestle with a surplus. '
A summary of the 'figures given out to the press
says: "The treasury surplus for the -fiscal year ending
yesterday is $52,710,035. "The receipts from cus-.
toms during the fiscal year aggregated; $.283,891,718,
the internal revenue receipts being $230,115,255, with
miscellaneous receipts of, $44;88o.552. The total ; re
ceipts for the year have been $558,887,725, and the ex
penditures $506,176,590.- The surplus for the fiscal
year ending June 30,. 1902, .was $92,194,370^ The re
pea! of the war revenue taxes has materially reduced
the surplus for the present, year, but trie present sur
plus is, nevertheless, much larger than the treasury
Officials had estimated.. The expenditures for. the
present year have been much greater, showing an in
crease over last year of about $35,000,000. This hi^"
crease. in expenditures has ; been in almost all of the
varijous -branches of the Government, the War De
partment expenditures, however, showing a decrease
of about $26,000,000. The navy shows an increase
over the last fiscal year of about $22,000,000."
While the surplus revenues have reached the fig
ures slated, the actual increase of cash in the treas
ury is given at only $19,357,651, the balance of the
surplus having been returned to circulation in busi
ness channels by the pavment of interest on the pub
lic debt, the expense HP refunding operations and the
redemption of certain Government bonds.
The money statements show that the total amount
of gold in the treasury on June 30, 1903. was $631,
639.898, an increase of $71,430,598 over 1902. The
outstanding gold certificates, less the amount of same
in the treasury on June 30, 1903, were $379,356,789, an
increase of $72,958,780 over the net amount in circu
lation at the beginning of the year. The treasury
notes of 1890, which amounted to $30,000,000 at the
beginning of the fiscal year, have by the coinage of
silver bullion^ into " sta'ndard silver dollars and sub
sidiary silver beeif reduced to $19,243,000. The amount
of public moneys held by national bank depositaries
on June 30, 1902, was $123,983,067, and on June jo,
1903, $i5i.7-*4.432. an increase for the year of
$27,741,365. B# ' "
O'NCEmore the of the books .;of
the national treasury; at. the, close.. of a fiscal
year makes \ a showing of prosperity; much
greater than was expected: Despite the fact that the
expenditures of the past year exceeded the estimates^
the revenues were sufficient to' overcome them, and
leave a surplus considerably in excess of the calcula
tion. ' The result is due to the unexpectedly large im
ports of" foreign goods paying duty, and that -in turn
is a proof of the 'augmented prosperity of the

The iÂ«suc is put substantially in this way: Under
existing conditions Colombia is in possession of an
isthmus across which a large part of the world's com
merce must pass. There are many steamship lines
converging at Panama and Colon that load and un
load there enormous quantities of merchandise in
transit, while large numbers of passengers are com
pelled to stop at each end of the isthmian railway.
From the transfer of merchandise, baggage and pas
sengers Panama derives a considerable revenue, and
quite a number of people depend upon it for a living.
Should the canal be constructed the whole of that in
dustry will vanish. Merchandise would not be loaded
nor unloaded, passengers would not stop. The big
ships would simply steam past Colon and Panama,
from ocean to ocean, going on their way without
giving employment to a single, isthmian laborer.
Perez says: "The isthmus of Panama offers no
allurements to the traveler or the archaeologist.
From their unhealthy shores the isthmians could only
watch the oqean steamers transport the productions
of the world without even pausing for the briefest
greeting.- Their position would be that of the peo
ple of a small town that sees its one slow train trans
formed into a lightning express. In the one case
they can take the train at will and^may avail them
selves of its other advantages: in the other they could
do nothing but boast that the great express flashed
past their windows." .
There is a valid ground for that argument. The
opening of the canal would undoubtedly put an end
to the transfer of merchandise and destroy the local
industry that now depends upon handling the goods
in transit. There would come to the Panama people
new opportunities, however, and if they have enough
enterprise they would profit by them. It appears they
are not confident of their ability to seize the new
chances for enterprise, and accordingly they desire
to hold on to what they have. It is not an argument
that appeals to a progressive people, .but one can
readily understand how it would have much weight
with the Colombians. J
As to the better method of dealing with the
problem Perez says: "What Colombians would like
to do about the canal would be to have their coun-.
try hold a permanent interest in the enterprise as a
partner of the United States, deriving, an income that
would benefit not a few officials of one political party,
but all the people for generations to come." 'Just
how such a partnership would be effected or operated
the writer does not say, but he asserts that all the
details could be deliberately and safely settled be
tween the two countries to the entire satisfaction of
both. The American people will hardly agree with
that proposition. The Government of Colombia is
too weak and too irresponsible for us to undertake a
partnership with it. We should be 'involved in
broils without end. The canal must be constructed,
owned and controlled solely by the United States.
If Colombia cannot agree to that, then the United
States must look elsewhere for a route. -
RAUL PEREZ, a member of one of the most
. distinguished of South American families, has
contributed to the current North American
Review a statement of the Colombian view of the
Panama canal question. His object is to show the
American people that those Colombians who are op
posed to the canal have a rational ground upon which
to base their objections, and that their opposition is
not due to a mere dislike of the United States or to
any innate antagonism to progress.
Senor Perez says the facts involved in the question
may be thus stated: "First, neither the Colombian
executive nor any ordinary Congress can constitu
tionally ratify" a treaty that involves a cession of ter
ritory to a foreign power; second, the canal will not
be of as much benefit to Colombia as those'who are
unfamiliar with the situation assume: third, Colom
bians firmly believe that there are Qther'solutions to
the problem, which, besides being fair, and legal,
would permanently satisfy both the United States and
Colombia.''
The first objection being one of constitutional law,
must be left to Colombian authorities tosettle. It
is" claimed by the opponents of the treaty that there
is a radical difference between granting a concession
to a private corporation like the French Panama
Canal Company, which would be subject to Colom
bian sovereignty, and granting a similar concession to
a sovereign power like the United States, and there
can be no question that the point is well taken.
There is, however, nothing derogatory to Colombia
in the proposed cession to the United States.* France
sold us the Louisiana Territory, Mexico sold us the
Gadsden purchase, without losing prestige; and Co
lombia could readily imitate their example with as
little wrong to herself. Such being the case, we must
look to the other objections for the real cause of
Colombian opposition, and we shall find it very
clearly stated by Perez. It amounts to a declaration
that the construction of the canal would injure the
business interests of Panama rather than benefit tliem:

Isaac Selby brought suit against Donald
McRae yesterday for the alienation of
Mrs. Selby's affections. The plaintiff was
unable to pay the legal fees, and upon
application to Presiding Judge Murasky,
he was allowed to file his complaint.
Selby makes some interesting allega
tions In his complaint. He alleges that
he married Theresa Beatrice Chapman In
the city of Auckland, New Zealand, on
October 28, 18S6. and that he lived hap
pily with her until she met the defendant,
Donald McRae. He claims that his wife
entered into business relations with Mc-
Rae, and that as a result of their associ
ation they became Intimate. He states
that this was against his expressed wish,
and that McRae alienated his wife's affec
tions from him and deprived him of the
love and care of his children.
Dr. Harvey announced the waif a lit
tle girl four or five weeks old and said
that she gave every appearance of having
received proper care prior to the aban
donment. She Is a blue-eyed and blond
haired mite, and last night seemed per
fectly content In the cot at the hospita.1.
The baby received her numerous visitors
composedly and eomewhat sleepily and
finally, when thoroughly warmed and fed,
went off into dreamlar^l as peacefully a;
though she was not lacking a mother's
loving care.
The clothing of the child, while scrupu
lously clean and abundant, was not ol
expensive material. In addition to the
ordinary under-clothing of the average
baby, she had on a frock embroidered In
silk, and a Chinese embroidered silk scarf
was tied about her head. Inside the col
lar of the frock was a laundry mark,
rather Illegible, that seemed to be "B
6tÂ»2." This was the only clew discoverable
last night that might lead to the dis
closure of the identity of the parents of
the abandoned baby. The police will en
deavor to ascertain whence came the lit
tle stranger on the doorstep.
Patrolman McGovern, whose beat is on
Hayes street, carried the waif, first to the
Hall of Justice. The Jail officials decided
that the prison was not a proper place for
such a charge and they had it conveyed
to the Central Emergency Hospital, where
Matron Kane made the tiny wayfarer
comfortable.
Swathed in warm and clean clothing,
With a bottleful of milk inside the wrap
pings and a rubber ring clutched in its
pudgy fist, a tiny rriite of humanity was
discovered on the front steps of the flat
at 95S Hayes street about 9:30 o'clock last
night. The feeble crying of the little one
attracted the attentlo'n of a girl who was
passing and she notified the Inmates of
the premises that a baby had been left
on their front doorstep. It was taken intc
the house and the police were notified. -
On the second floor toward the front upon
either Bide of the stairway wllj be two rooms
for special reference. The northerly wing U
to be used for bound newspapers ami periodi
cals, the southerly wing will be a lecture hall
with, seating capacity of 15<X). The central

for unbound periodicals, a committee j room
and additional - book stacks.
Thn mezzanine floor, with lance open spaces
around the circular light well ' with ample
wall space, will serve for exhibits. On this
floor, corresponding to, the rooms set apart
for the librarian and eecretary on the first
floor, will be two rooms, one of which is for
the trustees.
The basement will afford room for a news
paper reading-room In the northwesterly cor
ner, a work room In the northeasterly corner,
a central - large, hallway with space for bicy
cles, four small storerooms, room for receiving
and cataloguing books, a substation-room and
a lunchroom, besides lavatories for Â¦ the pub
lic and employes.
On the first floor will be the central deliv
ery hall with a delivery desk facing the en
trance. The northerly wing of the building
Is to be used as a reading-room, the southerly
wing as a children's- room and for bookshelves
of free access to the pubilc. Upon one side of
the entrance to this floor, will be the agrarian's
and the other the secretary's .office. Space Is
provided for a checkroom.-
The style of architecture is to be classic
and large Corinthian columns, 40 feet high
will be placed entirely around the building.
In the center of the building will be a ro
tunda fifty feet In dlameUr. with twelve
marble columns, surmounted by a glass dome.
Space for the book stacks will be ample
and conveniently located in the rear, central
portion of the structure. These book Â¦ stacks
are to be of the most modern type, entirely
of metal with glass floors, accessible at sev
eral points from rrfch story of the building.
The first floor will be reached by a broad
flfRht of steps in front of the central col
umns, also by stops leading to two side en
trances openlnK toward Grove and toward
Fulton streets.

Mike Fisher and his conquering heroe3
did not have a whole lot of trouble in put
ting Uncle's company away In the wood
shed yesterday afternoon on the Oakland
prairie. In every round but a couple they
had the lead by a run at least and when
the finishing tie was at hand they were
there- with victory. 6 to 4.
Uncle had his newest In the form ot
Eddie Hcrr on the firlnff line and the
youngster pitched good enough ball to
win most any game. But the error3
which his followers were good enough tÂ»
make with mon on the bags unnerved the
lad and robbed him of a chance to win
his third straight victory since deserting
the camp of Peter Lohman and his Oak
land Cripples.
The home team did not work in Its us
ual good form. Every man in the crowd
seemed to be suffering from an attack of
dope. They fielded like a bunch of rubes.
They could not hit the ball if it loomed
up as big as an airehip, and on the bases
they suffered from tangling of the feet.
In fact, the Senators played rings all
around them throughout the game and
deserved to win. They hit the ball fairly
weil and fielded good enough to get al
most everything that came along. Char
ley Doyle, out in center garden, was tha
only man who was out of form. He drop
ped two flies, both from the bat of Herr,
and each time the runner scored. The
score:

NEW YORK, July 7.â A Sandy Hook
calm- familiar to cup racers prevented
more than a brief trial of the two Sham
rocks to-day, but an hour's wind work
In a very light wind afforded the new cup
hunter an opportunity to demonstrate her
wonderful drifting qualities. The boats
started with the Shamrock I 100 yards tq
windward of the challenger. -Pointing
higher and footing faster, the new boat
worked out to windward of the old one
and forty-five minutes after the start was
an eighth of a mile to windward of her.
Then the wind died away to a calm and
at 3:10 the trial was abandoned.

and the Suburban have made his turf

Africander, gets $300.
The roar that greeted Africander's final
burst arose to a tornado of cheers as he
won. Bullman came in for tremendous
anu well earned applause when he weigh
ed out.
It was only fifty feet to the wire,
but the splendid colt raced doggedly on,
made vp a length and then, just as the
wire wap reached, showed his head in
front.
Cut off at the turn. Africander had lost
a length and now. with the goal less than
300 yards away, he was pocketed agalnxt
the fence by E3vable. with Golden Maxim
in front of him. Bullman kept his head
and waited for what seemed the Impossi
ble. Savable faltered and left six feet
rlp-ar and In an instant Africander had
turned out of his stride and was going
around Golden Maxim and gaining on him
at every jump.
CUT OFF AND POCKETED.
ICEW YORK. July 7.â Capping a climax
of victories unprecedented in the history
of the- American turf, Africander proved
himself to-day the greatest three-year
old thoroughbred of his generation. He
has surpassed the triumphs of Hanover
and Hermls, beaten the best handicap
horses and stamped his superiority
among his contemporaries in decisive
Ftyle. He won the Lawrence Realization
stakes at one and five-eiffhths miles at
Shecpshead Bay after a battle with prob
ably the best collection of three-year-olds
that has ever struggled for that classic
prize. He overcame speed, courage and
endurance In his adversaries, and, in
epite of misfortune after misfortune in
his own battle for the front, sprang to
the lead in the very last stride, after
radr.ff at a speed that broke two records
before the winning post was reached and
pet a new mark for future Realization
winners.
Africander won by a head from Golden
Maxim, which was two lengths in front
of Savable. Whorler followed four
lengths back: Short Hose was fifth, a
lrnpth and a half away and twelve
Jrngths in front of Black Hussar. Cardi
nal Woolsey was a sixteenth of a mile
behind the winner.
The time was 2:43 1-3. faster by 2 2-5
Wconds! than the record made by Major
Daingerfleld last year.
Africander was second choice at 3 to
1 In the betting. Short Hose, backed
from 4 to 1 to 5 to 2. was favorite.
GOLDEN MAXIM SETS PACK
To a very prompt start Cardinal Wool
!=ey, with Gannon up. was Quickest away,
but immediately went back and Golden
.Maxim, ridden by Coehran, took the lead
as the field swept down the Futurity
chute. Whorley, Odom up, carried Whit
ney & Duryea's colors close behind and
the Fellow and blue of John A. Drake
thowed Savable In third place.
They seemed to be going easily, but
the pace throughout the race was terri
fic. Africander was fifth passing the
*tand, but moved up on the turn into
the back stretch and ran to the stretch
closed lapped on Savable, who was third.
Odnm made his run with Whorler near
ing the far turn, but Golden Maxim
rated along, always holding the Brook
lyn Derby winner safe. Fhort Hose, the
favorite, victor in the historic Withers,
could never pet up to the leader?.
Despite the killing pace he had pet
throughout Golden Maxim wan turned
ir.to the stretch Ftill going easily and a
length ahead of Savable on the rail,
lapped by Africander. Golden Maxim
went wide and O'Neil tried to take Sava
b!p through, but the leader closed in
sharply and cut him off. O'Neil pulled
to the outFide and made his bid. Sava
ble responded with a splendid bum of
ppood and looked a winner for a moment.
Then Golden Maxim drew away.

from any position, for he led from the

ENGLISH SCULLER
DEFEATS JUVENAL
The commonwealth, said Donohue. had
been taught a sharp lesson es to the nec
essity for water conservation and irri
gation, which had now become part of a,
recognized federal policy. In this respect,
said Donohue. the federation would ba>
able to do much which the colonies sep
arately could not even attempt.
The matter of municipal ownership of
utilities was discussed and Donohue said
that up to the present the subject of mu
nicipal ownership, or as Australians pre
fer tt> put it. "control of local municipal
services," was only in an academic stage.
But there was an awakening of Interest
in that direction, owing largely, in New
South Wales, to the Initiative of the new
Sydney Town Clerk. Mr. Nesbitt, recently
brought from London to put municipal
matters on a better working basis.
In the matter of New Zealand's social
istic legislation, said Donohue, Aus
tralian public opinion considered it main
ly in the light of an Interesting experi
ment. The majority opinion did not favor
either State or municipal ownership, but
both were planks in the platform of the
Labor party. The heaviest blow that the
influence of the Labor party had received
came from public resistance to the organ
ized attempt in the recent strike in Vlo
toria to paralyze the railway system,
which was. of course, owned by the State
In each colony.
COUNTRY TAUGHT LESSON.
The nuestion of the Pacific was one of
growing importance to the commercial
and trading outlook for Australia, the ed
itor said. Germany also offered an ex
cellent market for Australia's best wool3.
which it could not afford to lose any more
than it could afford to limit the possibil
ities of trade with the United States.
With regard to Sir Edmund's promise
to Mr. Chamberlain to invite an expres
sion of opinion on the subject from Par
liament, Donohue said that Sir Edmund's
promise could not in any event be ful
filled until after the general election.
Donohue said that he had been asked by
a number of Americans whether trado
conditions were not in a bad way owtr.jr
to the seven-year drought. Donohue said
that the drought had broken and the
prospect was more cheerful than for
some years. He said that experience had
emphatically proved that Australia was
a country which recovers itself very rap
idly.
Donohue said New South Wales was
still strongly in favor of free trade and
that George H. Reid and other free trade
leaders had been conducting an active
campaign among the electors In all the
States. If Reid was returned to power,
in which event he would, of course, oust
the Barton high tariff ministry, he prom
ised a tariff Imposing duties for revenue
only.
Donohue then referred to the Right Hon.
Joseph Chamberlain's preferential dutiea
proposal between England and tho de
pendencies.
The decision, said Donohue, as to tho
Commonwealth's action would be largely
guided by the Issue of the electoral con
test between Sir Edmund Barton and Mr.
Reid. The adoption, however, of Mr.
Chamberlain's proposal was surrounded
by peculiar difficulties in Australia. Both
parties felt that Australia's prospect of
commercial expansion, especially in the
far East, would be seriously checked by
the practical closing of these markets by
preferential duties in favor of the mother
country.
Alluding to the political situation in
Australia. Mr. Donohue' said that at the
end of the year there would occur tfiÂ«
first general election after the First Fed
eral Parliament, which would give the
people of the Federated States of Aus
tralia their first opportunity of passing
Judgment on the working of the new Fed
eral Institutions and the manner la
which the first Federal Ministry had
shaped the commonwealth policy.
"The test question," said Donohue. "of
the election would be the Federal tiriff
introduced by Sir Edmund Barton, the
Prime Minister. Before the federation of
the colonies the different States had dif
ferent tariffs and it was expected that
the Federal tariff would be one of com
promise between high protection and free
trade. The Federal Ministers, however,
committed themselves to a high prote
ctive tariff, which was severely dealt
with, both by the House of Representa
tives and the Senate. In its amended
form the new law was subject to ratifi
cation at the general election In Decem
ber next," the distinguished Journalist
said.
In the States where protection existed
the feeling would favor a higher tariff.
CHAMBERLAIN'S PROPOSAL.
"There was a considerable growth of
Interest among the traveling public in
the Pacific routes and a marked Increase
in the number of those who appeared to
prefer to take that way of reaching Eu
rope."
Frank Donohue of the editorial staff of
the Morning Herald, Sydney, New South
Wales, arrived on the Sonoma on Mon
day. His visit here is partly due to the
increasing interest on the Eastern sea
board of Australia in the development of
trade with American ports. Speaking of
his visit to San Francisco, Mr. Donchu*
said:

Mrs. Levy always clung to the ancient
Jewish faith, retaining not alone the creed
but its symbolism as well, and she was
devoted to the orthodox religion. It had
often been said of her that a more chari
table woman never lived in Sacramento,
and In her sphere of life she did much to
alleviate distress and comfort the afflict
ed. The body arrived from San Francisco
to-night and the funeral will take place
to-morrow afternoon from the family
residence, 1011 O street. Rabbi -Benard M.
Kaplan of the Congregation B'nai Israel
will officiate. .-- :
Mrs. Levy was of an extremely nervous
and sympathetic nature and for months
she had worried concerning the fate of
her son, Nathaniel Liebling, who several
years ago went to the gold fields of Alas
ka in search of a fortune. His last letter
stated that he was to start for fresh min
ing fields far away from Nome, but that
she would presently hear from him. The
looked-for letter never came, however,
and Mrs. Levy refused to abandon her
gloomy forebodings. It was noticed by
her friends that the worry incidental to
her son's long absence undermined her
health and left her a prey to dangerous
maladies.

McLean, who is with the Sierra Club, in
the mountains, and W. C. Patterson of
Los Angeles, detained at home by busi
ness, the session was entirely informal.
The members present were the Rev.
Charles A. Ramm, Oscar K. Cushing and
Andrew M. Davis of San Francisco and
Professor E. C. Moore of the University
cf California. With the Governor the
beard discussed on broad general lines
the policy and scope of the law, but
adopted no specific plan of operation.
Because of the absence of Dr. McLean
and Mr. Patterson nothing was done to
ward organization of the board, nor was
anything said concerning the appointment
of a secretary, the only salaried position
under the board's control.
The law contemplates that the board
shall act in an advisory capacity toward
the various State institutions compre
hended within the title "charities and
correction," including State hospitals,
asylums, penal and like institutions.
Power is given for full inspection of
books, records and all operations. The

cation. Governor Pardee and his family
expect to leave shortly for a vacation trip
to the Santa Cruz Mountains.

members of the board, the Rev. J. K.
Meets at Governor Pardee's Resi
dence and Indulges in an
Informal Discussion.
STATE CHABITIES BOARD
HOLDS ITS FIRST SESSION
The fire spread rapidly, and the district
engineers, appreciating the seriousness of
the situation, went to work with a deter
mination to keep it within the bounds of
the Studebaker building, if possible.
In the rear of the building there Was an
elevator well and up this the flames
quickly made their way to the other
floors and spread northward toward the
front of the structure. At 2:30 o'clock
there was a sudden lull in the blaze, but
a few minutes later a terrific explosion
was heard and a second later the flames
were bursting out through all the win
dows facing on Market and Tenth streets.
It was later learned that the paint shop
of the firm was located on the top floor
and it was the ignition of the materials
there that caused the loud report and the
resulting concussion.
Adjoining trier- burning'^building on
Tenth street is a wooden structure used
as a planing mill by Andrew Christensen
and all that saved it from destruction was
the fact that the windows on that side
of the Studebaker building were covered
by iron shutters.
At 2:45" a. m. the water tower had been
brought into play. The building at this
time was badly gutted. At 3 o'clock
everything on the first three floors was
a total loss. At that hour the blaze,
which the firemen thought they had un
der control, broke out afresh. The smoke
was eo dense that the building could not
be seen from the street.
The firemen iÂ»--their heroic work were
favored somewhat by an easterly wind,
which gave assurance of safety to the
five-story building known as the Manhat
tan Hotel, which occupies the corner of
Market and Oaf streets, directly opposite
the burning building.
Martin Grimes > the watchman of the
building, occupied a room on the first
floor and was awakened by a buzzing
sound, evidently the noise resulting from
the contact of defective electric wires.
Jumping out of bed he was made to real
ize that the building was on fire and he
had little time to make his escape before
the upper floors were enveloped in flames.
Shortly after 2 o'clock this morning a
fire was discovered in the four-story brick
building on the southwest corner of Tenth
and Market streets, "occupied by the Stu
debaker Bros." Company, and in half an
hour's time the flames had almost de
stroyed the structure. -
The fire was first discovered by Police
Officer Beamer, who happened to be pass
ing along Tenth street arid noticed smoke
coming up from the . basement of the
building. He immediately turned in an
alarm, but before the . department ar
rived on the scene the flames had control
of the basement and were rapidly creep
ing up through the floors above.
The basement of the building. was used
for storage and packing purposes by
Studebaker Bros, and was filled with in
flammable material, which burned like
tinder. Frequent explosions plainly sug
gested to the experienced firemen * that
there were also stored within the base
ment paint and other dangerous liquids,
which contributed to the conflagration.
Neighboring Structures Are Endan
gered by Flying Sparks, and
Close Watch Is Kept to Pre
vent Further Damage.
Flames Get Start in Base
ment and Soon Reach
Upper Floors. -
With the police is the request of Con
stable SIttnn of San Miguel for Putnam's
arrest. The request gives Putnam's age
bp 25 yean 5 , and a general description, to

hard working woman of Paso Robles.

October to San Miguel with pome com

Later, it is asserted, persons represent

the girl's people. Miss Baker came to
Oakland on June 8 and went to the Ed
holm place. To Dr. Stetson the girl nar
xated her ptory. and upon that statement
the physician wrote the birth record.
Soon after the child was born, a mysteri
ous woman appeared at the Edholm
home, a refuge for girls, and It is said,
made an offer to the mother that she re
linquish the child on payment of $1000, the
offer being refused. Mrs. Edholm is out

"I continued this for years and paid

T. W. Farhner, a grip repairer, said his
wages were $75 a month. He thought
that if they were raised to $3 a day he
could save some money, but at the pres
ent rate ho was unable to put away a
cent. He said he was the father of two
children arid" that he would like to buy
a home for them. "If I can't do that,"
he said, "the next best thing I can do
is to take out life insurance for them and
get out of the road."
T.- Coller. a lamp cleaner and janitor
for the McAllister street car house, was
a very busy man, according to his testi
mony. Besides cleaning lamps and doing
general janitor work he had to act in the
capacity of car dispatcher when another
man went to his meals. He also had to
look out for blockades and for all these
duties earned only $50 a month. He got
two Sundays off each month, but other
wise worked- hard all the time.
The Â¦ taking of testimony will be re
sumed this morning at 10 o'clock.
COULDN'T SAVE MONEY.
STATIONAKY FIREMEN.
President Arthur Holland of the United
Railroads was the first witness called in
the afternoon. Much time was spent by
his refusing to furnish a list of the em
ployes who were working for the com
pany and who were not platform men.
His reason for refusing to give this in
formation was that he wished to pro
tect many men who v/ere working for the
company and were not members of the
union. A compromise was effected, Liv
ernash agreeing to read over the list
privately and not make the document a
public record.
The appearance of Edward Ellison on
the witness stand was prefaced by Liv
ernash by the statement that he was
being called to place his testimony on
the records for the benefit of the arbi
trators, as It would show that the United
Railroads was not friendly tQ organized
labor. Ellison Is president of the Sta
tionary Firemen's Union. He said that
the wages of the members of his union
were, for ordinary firemen. $2 75 a day
and for water tenders $3. This schedule
of wages was adopted last April by all
the big corporations, among them being
the San Francisco Electric Light Com
pany, the Independent Light and Power
Company, the Mutual Light and Power
Company and! the Palace Hotel. The
United Railroads had been asked to raise
the salaries of the stationary firemen in
its employ at that time, the witness said.
Manager Chapman had replied that he
would consider the matter, but the union
had never heard anything more about
it from the corporation.
John Sullivan, an oiler of cable tracks,
was the most fluent talker that had yet
ascended the witness stand. When asked
by Livernash to outline his duties, he
talked so fast that the shorthand re
porter Had to hint at a Mexican bit to
get him bacK to a reasonable gait. Sul
livan earned $65 a month, he said, and
had worked for the company many years.
While his testimony was being taken
Master Mechanic Bodler, a young man
wreathed In smiles, who evidently thought
the proceedings a huge Joke, entered the
room. He was classified by the carmen
as "a New Jersey importation by Man
ager Chapman," and Livernash objected
to his presence In the room while any of
the trackmen were giving their testimony.
L/ivernash's objection was made on the
grounds that the trackmen were under
the direction of Bodler and that the lat
tcr's presence, while the men were on the
stand, was a menace to them and an act
of coercion. Attorney Moore moved that
Bodler retire, which the young man did
relufctantly.
Alfred Sa'.e, a car cleaner, had a sad
story to tell. He worked eleven hours a
night for JjO a month, he said. He was
never allowed a day off and had worked
without a vacation for a whole year. He
was married and the father of four chil
dren. As the butcher now charged more
for meat his stews were few In number.
His rent had been raised from JS to $11 a
month, but he thought that if he was
raised to $2 50 a day and only worked nine
hours he could save some money.
BODLER WITHDRAWS.
He earned betv/een $G0 and J"0 a month,
and said: "Boss says I am a foreman."
He and another man employed by the
company received 22VÂ» cents an hour when
they worked overtime, all other track re
pairers receiving 20 cents overtime. In
answering the query whether he knew If
the cost of living had gone up, he replied
that "there was a lot of kicking at home
about it."
One after another employes of the
United Railroadsâ car repairers, grip Â¦ re
pairers, lamp cleaners and even the man
whose humble duty it is to push the car
Into the barnâ testified yesterday in the
arbitration proceedings between the
United Railroads and the carmen's union
that their hours of labor were too Ions
and that they believed they were entitled
to more money. The track repairers told
how they had to lay flat on the ground
and do all sorts of gymnastic stunts to
repair the read, the oilers attempted to
impress everyone with the responsibility
of their duties and each one had a tale of
woe.
J. J. Kearn, a laborer who works at
track repairing, was the first . witness.
Heath was removed last week at the
tame time Frank Schmltz. brother of the
Mayor, was deposed fresi the position of
Superintendent of Buildings.
Heath reported for duty last Monday
morning to President Michael Casey of
the Board of Public Works, and request
ed that he be assigned to duty a? a field
deputy, which is his official rating under
the rules cf the Civil Sorvice Commission.
Casey isiformed Heath that he had r.o
work to offer him and Heath replied:
â¢â¢I w!sh tu qualify for my position as
field deputy so that any action I may
take will be qMte legal."
Yesterday morning Heath served the
following notice in writing upon the
V,< ht6 of Public Works:
"You are hereby notified that I am
ready, willing ar.d able to continue the?
performance of the dutus of my onicial
position in the department of Hoard of
Public Works of the City and County cf
San Francisco, and 1 hereby request and
demand of you that I be restored to such
position." *. â¢
Heath's communication was received
and placed on file.
Heath received his rating as a field
deputy on August 7, 1S01, after taking the
Civil Service examination. He was third
on th<? list of candidates eligible for a
position in the Board of Public Works.
On September 6. 1PC1, Heath was given
a position in the Board of Public Works,
the office of Chief of the Bureau of
Streets being created at that time.
Mayor S<hrnitz recently suggested that
the work of the position of Chief of the
Bureau of Streets should be done by
Michael Casey, president of the Board of
Public Works. Casey retorted that the
Mayor's brother. Frank Schmitz. could
also be dispensed with. The Mpyor re
plied that he agreed' to this suggestion
and the result was that the Board or Pub
lic Works abolished the positions of
Hrath and the Mayors brother.
Heath claims that he car.not be removed
without cause ar.d that if the position of
Chief of Bureau of Streets has been abol
ished, he is still entitled to be retained
in the office as a iie!d diputy.
Benjamin Heath Jr., who was removed
from the position of Chlrf of the Bureau
of Streets by the Board of Public Works,
is preparing to make a legal contest to
tecure reinstatement.

The Weather and Crops.
The weekly repc.rt cf A. G. McAdie, section
director of the climate and crop service of the
Weather Bureau. U as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
Extremely hot weather prevailed throughout
the Htate on the I'd and lid. accompanied by
hUrh northerly winds in the central and north
'-rn â¢sections, with cooler weather at the clo?e
of the- week. Fires destroyed several hundred
rct*Â« of train in the Sacramento aad San
Joaquin valleys, and forest fires caused con?id
f-rahle damage In the coast reeion.
Harvesting, thrashing and hay baling are pro
gressing radlly in nearly ell sections. The yield
c.l grain and hay in Southern California is re
ported the heaviest for many years, and both
crops are of excellent quality. Early wheat
and barley are yielding fair crops In the cen
tral and northern sections and nearly average
in some of the district*, but fires and high
xvin4Â« have materially affected the crop. Late
wheat ie rejÂ»orted in soruewhat better condi
tion than oxj>ected In witne of the northern
Â« oast counties, but the yield will be very light:
hugar beet harvest Is progressing. Hops have
made slight Improvement in the pa*t week and
will probably yield a fair crop in some sec
tions. Bean*, corn, fcxjtatoes and vegetables
are doing mell.
The high winds caused much damage to
rij-enlrig deciduous fruits in the central and
northern districts, come reports stating that the
loss will be fully one-half the crop. Peaches
and apricots are dropping badly in portions of
â¢he Santa Clara Valley. Fruit picking, drying
ind canning are projrreEzlng. Grapes and
citrus fruits were not damaged by the wind
und continue in excellent conaition. The out
look in cood for an unusually heavy yield of
raisins. ....

grain pit to-day was again bullish and prices
moved in an upward direction, September
closing 14Â©l*sc higher, September corn 1%@
lUc higher, with oats a shade higher.
Trading In wheat was active and the market
was decidedly strong, while higher prices were
realized. Commission houses were good buy
ers at the start and opening prices were steady.
September being VÂ»c lower to 4c higher at
75 : )i<S'7yo. With outside markets showing a
big advance in prices and on the strength in
corn the demand soon became more urgent,
while the offerings continued small, which re
sulted In a gradual advance throughout the
day. The bullish sentiment was augmented by
the decrease of three million bushels In Brad
street's world's visible supply. There was a
slight recession late In the day, but the, close
was extremely strong, with September 14<gl%o
higher at 77%S774c aÂ«er selllng-up to 77^@
77%c. The Hr.Â«t car nf new wheat arrived to
day and was graded No. 3 red. /
Notwithstanding the favorable weather con
ditions, bullish crop reports were numerous In
the com pit and caused a big general . trade in
that market. September option was especially
strong and closed 1%@1Uc higher at 52%Â®>
624 c
Oats were strong:, but the advance was not
as marked as in other grains owing to heavy
realizing by leading longs. September closed
a Fhade hlsher at :Â«iWi354c.
Provisions ruled dull and featureless with nn
easier tone prevailing. There was a decline
early on selling by outsiders and, although the
market steadied later on the strength in
grains, none of the loss was recovered. Sep

fear that an unfavorable showing of earnings
was forthcoming th-s speculative
sentiment and prices " gave way â¢ throughout.
The closing wal in consequence dull and easy.
The early ; firmness was due. Â«s much as any
thing, to the fact that yesterday's gold ex
ports failed to bring any selling pressure on
the market. -.The departure of gold from Aus
tralia for San Francisco and. the beginning of
the Klondike product counteract* d the Influ
ence of th* Outgo to Europe. The export of
Fold, hovua aroused slight misgivings,
while the demand for money for Immediate
u$e is so tiÂ« bt. It is presumed any rise in the
money rate would check the gold outgo, but
in the present condition . further shipments
would not cause surprise. Satisfaction is felt
in all departments of the linancial world at
the letting out of the inflation in the cotton
market which went a step further to-day. But
it la not exivected that the curtailed demand
for cotton will revive in any degree until con
ditions in the market become more placid.
The weekly cotton report was distinctly favor
able and Â»a.Â» so far a help- to stocks. The
news of the corn crop was also highly favora
ble, but the rise In the price of corn detracted
from Its influence.
The news of the wheat crop was not consid
ered Â»o reassuring. The monthly report of tho
-Agricultural Department due on . Friday is
aw&lted for clearer light on the conditions of
the cereal crops. A break of nine points in
Standard Rope and Twine 6s was due to fears
that the Interest would not be paid. This,
with a break of 5% in United States Castlron
Pipe and of lees amounts in some other minor
industrials and the weakness of International
Mercantile Marine stocks on the curb were
unsettling Influences on the speculation. Not
much attention was paid to the late rise in call
loanx of 5 per cent, although the outward
movement of gold and a significant drop in
New York exchange at Chicago to lo cents dis
count may Indicate further demands upon New
York banking: reserve*.
The bond market was irregular. A feature
Is the sagging tendency of some of the high
grade issues. Total sales, par value, $1,005,
000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the lnst call.

NEW YORK, July 7.â Th?re was more ap
pearance of epeculative interest in to-day'*
Etock market. The fluctuations of the market
in the face of dullness seemed to encourase an
attempt to put up price*. There was no ntws
to account' for the point rise- in St.*-" Paul and
Missouri Pacific on professional operations.
Despite this not very striking demonstration,
-the market was but a colorless affair up to
the last hour and the volume of dealings
showed no appreciable Improvement over that
of yesterday. There was some indication of
a speculative contest In the last hour, in which
neither side gave sign* of any great strength.
The market had begun to sap off from Inani
tion, but stiffened again whvn a heavy stream
of United States Hteel stocks began to pour
upon the market. The common was Parried a
point under laet nleht. the preferred -% and
the second mortgage bonds suffered" to a less
extent. : Nothing waa known to the public at
the time of the showing for the quarter earn
ings, but the assembling of the directors or
the corporation to consider the report. The

Jesse Marks is recognized as a power
in the Fortieth Assembly District, yet
the voters Have a right at any time to dis
pute his sovereignty. The manner of dis
puting it, however, should be in due form
at the primary election. Marks Is show
ing 1 an inclination to withhold his sup
port from the United Republican League.
The story is current in local political cir
cles . that league organizers have told
Marks that if he did not get into camp
with Ruef, Ach, Lynch and Riordan they
would turn down Harry Baehr, who
wants the indorsement of the Republican
convention for a second term as Auditor
of SaVi Francisco.
It is the general opinion of citizens that
Aifditor Baehr Is discharging the duties
of his office in a proper manner. It hap
pens, however, ' that Jesse Marks is his
political and personal At the lo
cal Republican convention two years ago
Marks, as the leader of the Fortieth Dis
trict delegation, made a successful battle
in the Interest of Baehr for. Auditor.
There is an impression that he is sup
porting Baehr for a second term.
The threat to put in another man for
Auditor in order to wreak vengeance on
Marks "will not promote Republican har
mony in the Fortieth or any other As
sembly district.
United Republican League Warns
Jesse Marks to Get in Line.

-The alliance petition to the Board of
Election Commissioners contains the fol
lowing concerning the Republican local
convention of 1902;
On the ICth day 6f September. l!>02, the Re
publican local convention of the city and
!;?".", ? San Fra nciseo convened and sub
divided its delegates into district conventions,
in conformity to the call issued by the Re
publican State Central Committee nnd the Re
publican County Committee of the city and
county of San Francisco, and nominated can
didates for Assemblyman and State Senators,
and said local convention adjourned without
electing or appointing a governing committee
for the territory It represented, and upon roll
call refused to appoint or elect a governing
committee; and we call your attention to the
said section of the Political Code (USti) and
declare that the same is now in full force and
effect, and by operation of law that portion
of the Republican party of the State of Cali
fornia embraced' within the city and county
of San Francisco is without a governing com
mittee; that at the last biennial convention
of said party held In San Francisco during
the month of September. 1902. said convention
did, by, a two-thirds vote, refuse to appoint
a governing committee to represent the party
for the territory of the city and county of
San Francisco, whereby the title of Republican
party may be conveyed to the Republican
voters of San Francisco, according to law.
The convention is to be composed 'of
450 delegatesâ twenty-five delegates from
each Assembly district of the city. The
point is raised by the Mutual Alliance
organizers that the County Committee
apportionment gives to seven districts a
majority of the convention, leaving eleven
districts in the minority. Two thousand
signatures will be required to render the
petition effective.
Martin Kelly, chief deputy^ organizer;
A. C. Berthier, general organizer, and
quite a number of subordinate organizers
of the Republican Mutual Alliance met
last night at 1104 Market street, room 17,
to consider what steps should "be taken
by Martin Kelly and his friends to pro
mote harmony in politics. Kelly holds
that there exists no longer such an or
ganization as the governing body of the
Republican party of San Francisco.
He produces the record of the Republi
can local convention, September 17, 1902.
to show that the convention by a decisive
vote refused to create a county commit
tee and contends therefore that the party
has no governing body. In view of this
condition of affairs his followers have in
formed the Board of Election Commis
sioners that a Republican convention will
be held on Tuesday, September 15, at 8
p. m. The call is made in accordance
with section 1361 of the Political , Code.
Of course, delegates to the convention
must be chosen at the primary election
on Tuesday, August 11.
Mutual Alliance Organizers Call a
Republican Convention.

A^ regular meeting of the State Board of
Prison Directors will be held next Satur
day. The board will then elect a warden
of San Quentin prison to succeed M. A.
Aguirre, whose term of four years expired
on the 1st of this month. There are many
applicants for the position of Warden and
every day adds a name or two to the list
of "aspirants for the place. The prison
directors are reticent concerning the pjob
able action of the board in 'relation to
the San Quentin wardenship. Friends 'of
Captain J. C. Edgar are quite confident,
however, that he will be. chosen to suc
ceed Aguirre. Knowledge of. prison af
fairs, derived from fifteen years' experi
ence as second in command, it is said,
will count largely in Edgar's favor. The
directors have resolved to render the ad
ministration of affairs at San Quentin
creditable to the State, therefore it is be
lieved that a practical man of force and
intelligence, who has had the training to
render him efficient in every department
of the responsible office, will be elected.
. LONDON, July 8.â The Constantinople
correspondent ot the Daily Telegraph
quotes an officer of hisrh rank in the
Turkish army as declaring that war with
Bulgaria appears to be inevitable, '. that
Turkey was never so well prepared for
hostilities and that the army on the fron
tier is anxious to begin, but the Sultan's
policy is to remain quiet until attacked.
VIENNA, July 7.â In well-informed
political circles it is expected that Russia
will shortly warn Bulgaria in an unmis
takable manner against making war on

Â£ St. Dominic's Church Wednesday, at 0
o'clock. Â¦ _^^stage station a' few miles farther on,
from whefe a horseman was hurried by a
trail to Leesville. Sheriff Sherer was no
tified and with a posse immediately left
for the scene of the holdup. He was not
lon^ in finding the trail, which led down
the mountain grade toward the valley.
The robber did not molest the mallbaga
or Wells, Fargo & Co.'s box and only se
cured about $200 in money from the thir
teen passengers. He said he did not want
the watches or Jewelry â that he was out
for cash only. The robber was of me
dium size, with light hair and blue eyes.
The description .tallies exactly with that
of the bandit of last year, and the officers
suspipit'an ex-convict named Lemos, a
Portuguese about 27 years of age, for
whose arrest there is now a standing re
ward of $C00.
Driver Williams, who Is now with the
Sheriff's posse, had a former experience
with stage robbers and only a few years
ago In Napa County he was with Con
gressman Bell and a. party when they
surrounded Bandit Buck English. It was
a bullet from -Williams' trifle that brought
English to earth and caused his capture.
Williams was also wounded in the fight.
was nearing the ''summit of Brim. Moun
tain and the driver Â¦was narrating the In
cidents of .the first holdup, when all on
board were startled by the loud com
mand:
.. "Hold up your team and every passen
ger get out and stand here in a line, and
hurry up about It."
At the same time a masked man stepped
into view from a clump of bushes. His
rifle was leveled at the stage. The pas
sengers climbed out and at the bandit's
direction lined up on the roadside. Then
they were commanded to lay their money
in the middle of the road, in a pile. When
they had complied the road agent ordered
them back into the stage and told the
driver to move on, adding that he intend
ed to camp at that spot until dark and
would shoot the first person who attempt
ed to come back to give the alarm. .
One of "the women, Mrs. Helms of Up
per Lake, had $5 50. The highwayman
asked .her why she. was going to Bartlett
with only that amount of money. On her
replying that she lived at Upper Lako, he
gave it back to her, remarking that nfie
could get along with it there.
Driver Williams hurried his team to the
BARTLETT SPRINGS STAGE, WHICH WAS HELD UP NEAR THE DIVID
ING LINE BETWEEN COLUSA AND LAKE COUNTIES BY A MASKED
BANDIT, WHO ROBBED THE THIRTEEN PASSENGERS OF MONEY.

by Police Judge Fritz yesterday on the
charge of misdemeanor embezzlement and
was ordered to appear for sentence on
July 14. He was accused of embezzling
$25 which was handed to him last August
by J. J." Allen as a contribution from
Cornlcemakcrs' Union No. 104 to the fund

Pennsylvania. Saunders' attorney raised
the technical ' point that Saunders was
not an agent of the Cornlcemakers' Union
and in that respect the complaint was
defective, but the Judge ruled against
him.

JUDGE MORROW SUSTAINS
DEMURRER OF THE CITY
COLUSA, July 7.â At the spot on
the Brim 'grade a few miles east
of the dividing line between Co
- lusa and Lake counties, where the
Bartlett Springs "stage was held
up in July last year by a lone highway
man, the job was again successfully ac
complished yesterday afternoon by a ban
dit. From the cool manner in which his
work was done and the method he used,
the officers feel positive that one man is
responsible for both robberies.
The six-horse Bartlett Springs stage,
with "Driver John Williams on the box,-
In the inquest into the cause of death
of Joseph Molinari, an aged Italian shoe
maker, who was killed on June 17 by be
ing struck by car No. 20 of the California
street line at the crossing of California
and Dupont streets, a similar verdict, ex
onerating the gripman, was rendered. The
testimony was that Molinari was cross
ing the street with a box on his shoulder
as the car was coming down the steep
grade, and that the motorman not only
rang his bell continuously, but shouted
at Molinari as well. The front of the car
struck Molinari, throwing him to the
ground and fracturing his skull.
"We also find that the gripman did all
that was possible to avoid the accident,
and no blame attaches to him, the death
being accidental."
John Stewart, a son of the decedent,
testified that the car was traveling at a
high raie of speed. After specifying the
cause of death the verdict goes on as
follows:
A coroner's jury exonerated from blame
yesterday C. B. Blennerhassett. motor
man, for the death of "ft*. R. Stewart, an
octogenarian who resided at 253 Pierce
street. Stewart was struck by a gravel
car of the United Railroads while he was
crossing the street near his home on June
19. Several of his ribs were broken and
he died shortly afterward In the Central
Emergency Hospital.

In connection with the trial an appli
cation was made for the purpose of com
pelling Dunsmuir to produce documents
dealing' with the alleged payment of $5000
to the firm of Wilson & Wilson of San
Francisco, which, it was urged, was done
for the purpose, not of probating tho will,
but'of Inducing Mrs. Alexander Dunsmuir
to enter into an agreement with James
Dunsmuir, which she did.
Mrs. Dunsmuir, by the agreement, was
entitled not only to $25,000 a year, but to
half of the profits from any business in
terests which her late husband had In the
State of California. The Judge held that
the- check for the $5000 should be produced.
VICTORIA. B. C, July 7.â The trial of
the suit brought by Enda Wallace %op^
per against James Dimsmulr for the pur-'
pose of setting aside the -will of the late
Alexander Dunsmulr opened to-day*before
Justice .Irving. Previous to the formal
opening of the proceedings the examina
tion of James Dunsmuir was continued
before the registrar. Dunsmuir refused to
answer any questions as to the amount of
slock held by his brother, as to whether
the witness now controlled It or whether
he had in his possession documents which
would reveal this. Further examination
was therefore deferred by Mr. Duff.
The refusal of Dunsmuir to answer
these questions and the objection of the
trial Judge to having the case further de
layed caused Mr. Bodwell. counsel for the
plaintiff, to Intimate tnat he was serious
ly considering whether or not to put in
any evidence. Finally an adjournment
was taken until to-morrow, Â»when the ac
tion will probably proceed. Dunsmuir, the
defendant, has been ordered to answer
the interrogatories regarding the value of
the estates and business Involved In the
action.
