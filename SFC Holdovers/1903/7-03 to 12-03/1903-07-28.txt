LONDON. July 2S.-Manchurian affairs
occupied a great deal of attention In the
London papers this morning. Besides an
interview with the Japanese Minister, re
peating the statements made at the Jap
anese legation last Friday to the effect
that Japan's policy was to wait and watch
Russian developments in the East, all of
the dallies reproduce the Associated Press
interview with Director Hartwig of the
Russian Foreign Office. Comparisons are
drawn between the peaceful acd dignified
attitude of the Japanese officials and the
â¢â¢insulting, provocative character" of the
remarks of the Russian director, whose
statements are regarded as demanding a
disavowal on the part of the Russian Gov
ernment. The Graphic says:
"Unless he (the director) is taken se
verely to task the situation will become
exceedingly dire, for Japan is not likely
to sit quiet under the threat of annihila

The convicts were traveling in

proceeded on in the direction- of

Shortly after leaving Pilot Hill
they were overtaken by the
posses from Sacramento, Folsbm

the Folsom posse opened nego

horses attached to the convicts'
wagon. This temporarily blocked
the advance and an open fight
ensued.
Convict Fred Howard was
killed outright and Seavis, the
negro convict, was badly wound

managed to escape.
It was also noticed that Convict
Gordon and another convict were
missing and it is presumed that
they dropped out somewhere be
tween Folsom and Pilot Hill and
have taken to the woods, which
anywhere in this locality would
provide safe hiding.
Guard Jetter, who is still in the
hands of the convicts, is a resi
dent of Lincoln, Placer County.
It is feared that he and the other
three guards will be killed before
they are released.

A JAILBREAK, unparalleled in the history of California for perfection of ' conspiracy, atrocity of crime and amazing completeness of 'success, occurred at the State Penitentiary located at Folsom t in Sacramento County, yester
f\. dax morning. Thirteen convicts, notoriously identified with the criminal records of- a dozen counties, Â¦overpowered Warden Wilkinson and several of his officers and made their way out of the prison enclosure under the mus
cles of Gatling guns, which could not be /ired because of the fear that the Warden and his fellow-captives might suffer injury . One. of the guards was killed, the general overseer was fatally wounded and several other men were
injured until knives and razors. The fugitive criminals were pursued to Pilot Hill, in El Dorado County, and there gave battle. One convict was killed and another was wounded.

The Cardinals to-day again discussed
the advisability of sending a note to the
powers regarding the condition of the
Holy See. Some of them insisted on the
necessity of not allowing the occasion to
pass without again protesting against the
occupation of pontifical territory by Italy,
thereby showing that the Papacy is de
termined to maintain its claims unabated.
Others paid they thought that such a note
would not add any forcfc to the many pro
tests of the same kind already made,
while it might Interfere with the policy
which the future Pope may desire to fol
low, and added that the best thing to do
was to leave the successor Of Leo XIII
entirely free to choose tne course which
he may consider best for the good, and
general interests of the church. . . Â¦
No decision on the subject was arrived
at. If the Cardinals determine to send the
note it will probably be delivered to the
diplomatic body on'Thursday. v : â¢

In presenting the condolences of the royal
family of Spain. The Spanish people re
member with affection the predilection of
Leo XIII for Spain and the help their
country received during their difficult pe
riod from the defunct Pontiff, who, being
the godfather of King Alfonso, was con
sidered by all Spaniards a beloved father
who watched over their destiny. Cardinal
Oreglla thanked the Spanish Cardinal in
the name of the Sacred College.
Several of the Cardinals proposed, in
view of the extreme heat, to celebrate
mass during the conclave in the Pauline
chapel early enough every morning to
complete the morning ballot In thft Sisttne
chapel by 11 o'clock. This proposition was
agreed to.
AMERICAN PRELATE'S ROOM.
The representative of the Associated
Press was permitted to enter Â¦ the cell
which Cardinal Gibbons will occupy dur
ing the conclave. When the lots for apart
ments were drawn the American Cardinal
drew No. 5, the modesi apartment of
Comtnendatore Puccinelll, the master of
the house. It Is a few steps up from the
ground floor on the left of -the Noble
Guard staircase, entering" from the court
of San Dimas. The bedroom of the Car
dinal is decorated, -with paper of an or
dinary yellowish gray, and it contains a
email- black iron bed, a marble-top dress-
Ing table, a small writing desk, an arm
chair, an iron clothes, stand, a little high
movable mirror framed in iron and wood
and a prie' dieu at the slda of the bed.
Over the be.d hangs the picture of a ma
donna.
Adjoining this is the room of the.con
clavist, which is smaller, with about the
same furniture, except that the chairs are
more simple, with cane bottoms, and with
a mirror and clothes pegs attached to the
walls. A smaller room, with a camp bed,
is for the use of the servant. The fourth
room will- be of little use, as It is without
a, -window. The apartment is lighted, with
electricity. \t probably will be very warm,
as It has a full nouthern exposure.
The bedroom of the Cardinal measures
only fourteen feet by eleven.
At to-day's meeting of the congregation
flfty-two Cardinals were present, and all
noticed the exceptionally cordial reception
accorded to Cardinal Gibbons, who was
visibly touched by it. He thanked all of
his colleagues and embraced Cardinal Sa
tolli.
The ecclesiastics view the approaching
ceremony with some alarm, believing that
the ahtl-clerlcals may take advantage of
the opportunity to make counter-demon
stration against the sympathy expressed
throughout Italy in connection with the
death of the Pope. â¢
CARDINAL GIBBONS' WELCOME.
A proclamation was posted In the
streets of Rome to-night inviting citizens
to the "annual commemoration. . of the
death of King Humbert, which will tyke
the form of a procession through 'the
streets to the Pantheon. Early in_ the
morning of July 23. under the auspicca of
patriotic and other societies, the Italians
will visit the tomb of Humbert at tlie
Pantheon and decorate it with flowers.
Commemorative exercises at the capital
will follow. For thlV event King Victor
Emmanuel will return., to Rome on
Wednesday. Queen Margherita will ar
rive to-morrow.
It is now practically certain that all of
the Cardinals will be present at th*-con
clave except Cardinal Moran, Archbishop
of Sydney, who will- not reach Rome in
time, and Cardinal Cclesla, Archbishop of
Palermo, who is too ill to attend.
"Indeed," said Cardinal Logue, "I think
Cardinal Gibbons will be a subject for
commiseration if the selection should de
volve upon him, for no American would
care to spend the rest of his life confined
within thfe precincts of the Vatican."
FAVORS WITHHOLDING NOTE.
The Irish Cardinal expressed the opin
ion that the question of sending a .note
to the powers â¢ protesting : against the
treatment of the Vatican/, by the Italian
Government should be lift .to. the next
Pope. To-morrow Cardinal Logue will
pay an official visit to, Cardinal Oreglia
and then he will formally, join. the congre
gation. "., ;

ROME, July 27.â Almost all of the Car- j
dinals of the conclave have now arrived.
Their time to-day was mainly occupied
with a lengthy meeting of the congrega
tion, which was notable for the cordiality
with which Cardinal Gibbons was re
ceived. After the meeting the Cardinals
received numerous visits- at tiJ*ir vanuus
residences.
In well-infoyned circles Cardinal Angelo
di Pletro, pro daetary of th.e late Pope, is
being talked of as a compromise candi
date in the event that either CardinAls
Oreglla, Gottl, Rainpolla or Serafino Van
nutelli is unable to secure the vote..
Should Dl Pietro receive the vote he will
be the representative of the Rampolla-
Gotti faction and yet would be fairly ac
ceptable to all. . Â¦ .
Cardinal Michael Logue, Archbishop of
Armagh, who, with the exception of
Cardinal Gibbons, will be the only Kng
lish-speaking Cardinal in the conclave,
arrived to-day from Ireland. He said he
believed that the successor, to Leo would
be quickly chosen. In this case, perhaps,
the hope is father to the thought, aa he
said he did not look forward with a great
degree of pleasure to being shut up in the
Vatican during the present hot weather.
Speaking of Cardinal Gibbons, the Irish
Cardinal paid him a glowing tribute, al
though, like all the priests here, he held
out no hope that the American Cardinal
had the remotest chance of election.

STOCKTON. July 27.â The news of the
arrest of Harry H. Hewlett, and the sen
sational allegations leading up to it,
created a profound sensation here. Hew
lett Is a nephew of the late Millionaire
H. H. Hewlett, and has been In the First
National Bank, one of his uncle's proper
ties, since he was a mere youth. Young
Hewlett Is a high roller and has set the
pace for the. younger sports of the city.
He is an enthusiastic automoblllst and
has generally followed the fads of fash-'
ion. He has been accounted considera
ble of a "ladles* man," but this Is the
first Instance where his relations have
been made the subject of press reports.
He has never, apparently, been at a loss
for money. Hewlett has been raised here
and despite his propensity to hit the high
places he Is accredited with good business
ability. He has moved In the best of so
ciety and has been particularly prominent
in theatricals.
Hewlett's Disgraceful Conduct Re
gretted in His Home City.
SENSATION IN STOCKTON.
NAPA, July 27,-^An Italian, whose
name is given as John Farrell. was
drowned here while swimming in the
Napa River back of the Vernon Mills this
afternoon.. Farrell had been employed in
the cookroom at the Napa cannery for
about . a week and before that- followed
the occupation of dishwasher. Monday
afternoon he drank considerably and
while in an intoxicated condition decided
to go In swimming. The body has not
been found.
Cook Drowned in Napa River.
Hewlett recently fell heir to $20,000 by
the death of his uncle, H. H. Hewlett,
and it is said that he has been traveling
a rapid pace since the acquirement of the
n.oney.
The thought of what that brute did to my
little girl almost drives me crazy. She is only
ah Innocent child, as all who know her will
testify, and I cannot imagine what prompted
this man to treat her as he did. The disgrace
of the affair has nearly driven us all frantic,
and I purpose to see that the outrage Is pun
ished if there be such a thing as justice.
O. R. Reibensteln, father of the young
woman, arrived from Stockton last night.
He is a brother of R. R. Reibensteln, who
was at one time Mayor of Stockton, and
both men have held many important po
litical positions in that city. Speaking of
the treatment which his daughter was
subjected to at the hands of Hewlett, he
said:
The apartments where Miss Relben
stein was confined belong to A. F.
Schleicher, who Is at present absent from
the cltv and who turned them over to
Hewlett during his stay In San Francisco.
The_ Stockton cashier has been going a
merry pace while here and has been ar
rested twice during the lasty week for
driving his automobile at unlawful speed.
FATHER IS FURIOUS.
He said he called her up by telephone
and asked her If she did not want to say
good-night and that she replied In the af
firmative. Accordingly, he says, he rang
the bell at 1127 O'Farrell stret and she
opened the door and came down stairs to
meet him. He says he asked her to come
to his room sand she did so â¢willingly.; He
did not use 'any force on her and she
made no outcry or protest. Her replies
to -those who sought admission, ha said,
were entirely voluntary and were not
even suggested by him. - Â¦* -- â¢Â¦.
When asked to explain the marks on
the young woman's throat: and ..arms he
could not and was. finally forced to admit
that he was much intoxlcated."
"But It is impossible that I would use
any force toward her or any other
woman,"- he said. V.'.Y:
He concluded his denials 'with ;. a slur
on the character of , the girl he had treated
so cruelly and intimated that she would
suffer no hurt to her reputation by being
in his apartments at such unusual hours.
SLURS HIS VICTIM.
In order to stop my cries, he shewed his
fingers down my throat, causing me the most
intense agony. After awhile I heard voices
outside demanding admittance. He told them
that I was in his rooms voluntarily and when
I denied his assertion he caught me around
the throat and choked me Until he forced me
to corroborate his statement. This happened
repeatedly during the time he held me prison
er. He waa much Intoxicated and acted like
a madman. I do not remember clearly all
that happened during those terrible hours, but
finally the liquor overcame him and he went
to sleep.
I arose, unlocked the door, and more dead
than alive managed to reach Mrs. Benham's
rooms. She and the rest of the household were
waiting for me and I told them my story.
Mr. Hewlett is an acquaintance of many
yearn' standing. He haÂ« repeatedly declared
his love for me and wanted me to marry him.
but my family objected to his attentions and
denied him the privilege of visiting me be
cause of his dissipated habits.
Hewlett promptly released himself by
depositing $200 cash on the two charges
against him. He was seen at the offices
of his attorney, Charles A. Low, and
talked readily ! about the matter. He
said he had known Miss Reibensteln
many years, but had never proposed mar
riage to her or expressed any great af
fection for her. He said she came down
to the cltv from Stockton to meet him.
He denied using abusive language to
ward her or her companion in front of
the. theater. . t
BRUTAL ABUSE
We were preparing for bed when the tele
phone commenced to ring and I surmised that
Mr "Hewlett was calling me up. I did not
answer at first, but finally concluded to do
to. in order that the ringing might stop and
not â¢listuib the other lodgers in the fiat. He
naij something about It being all over with
us and I answered that I was glad of it and
hung up the phone. Fifteen. minutes later the
doorbell rang and I answered It. opening the
door lioni the top of the stairway.
l:*-forc I could realize it. Mr. Hewlett had
dashed up the stairway and grasped me
around the body and was pulling me down
the stairs. I cried out time and again, hop
ing gome one would come to my assistance.
I was nearly without clothing. He carried me
through the doorway and out Into the street.
Then he dragged me along O'Karrell street
to Franklin. At the corner I ' fell to the
sidewalk and he stumbled over me. 1 was
screaming all the time and I could see win
dows going up In the neighborhood and hear
other women crying out. He forced me
against an Iron fence, on Franklin street and
hurt my back terribly. Then he took me
through the alley to the rear entrance of his
apartments and forced me Inside. He locked
the door and threatened to kill me If I did
not quit screaming.
been acquainted a number of years. He had
an automobile and he asked us to accompany
him on a ride. He was very much under the
Influence of liquor at the time. We refused
his Invitation and he then became abusive
both to me and Mrs. Benham. We wore fright
ened at his behavior and ran along Mason
street to Ellis, where we caught the car and
came home.
Between the Incendiary who fires his
neighbor's barn in secret vengeance, and
the "Worthy who starts a "run" on a
Bank with malicious gossip, there is
only a technical difference.
Gossip-with-a-purpose has too often
been used to stab character and to
wreck fortunes, and it is a great pity
the law cannot better reach those who
employ such intangible and insidious
methods to achieve their ends.
Scarcely any enterprise, or individ
ual, no matter how deserving, is safe
from the subtle dangers of the Gossip
monger, and human nature so loves a
morsel of such "news" tnat it can be re
lied upon to "push along" a rumor when
once it has been Judiciously started.
A vivid illustration of the gross injus
tice such a rumor can do is seen in the
"Force" Food Company's advertisement
of this date, where in a reward of 55000
is offered for the conviction of the par
ties who Initiated the suggestion that
"Force" was drugged. Â»
A further offer of $5000 for evidence
that a single package of the fifty million
sold contained anything except Wheat.
Barley*and Table Salt is, of course, a
complete refutation of the rumor, even if
the State Supervision of Foods was not
in itself ample protection.
People who love fair play in business,
as well as In other matters, will read
with indignation that it has cost The
"Force" Food Company over $50,000 to
publish a refutation of this "rumor" In
the newspapers of the United States and
Canada, and. probably, as much more in
loss of sales resulting from the baseless
gossip which did the harm.
The absurdity of tbe rumor is ap
parent when it is^Siown that the publio
has consumed fifty million packages of
"Force" without a single instance of any
ill effect upon any one of the users.
The "Force" Co. are evidently suffer
ing the usual penalty for success.
That Curse Called Rumor.
Hauling sheets around the mark, the
Reliance began eating ou,t to the weather
of the Constitution. They went about on
the port tack about 2:10 and after the new
boat drew ahead and to windward stead
ily. The Columbia sailed a fast race to
windward and by a fortunate slant of
wind close under the Newport shore
hauled up so much on the Constitution
that the latter barely beat her across the
finish line. Summary:

Reliance 11:30:06 3:04:09 3:33:41
Columbia 11:32:00 3:10:11 3:38:11
Constitution 11:30:37 3:09:18 3:38:39
The three yachts raced over a leeward
and windward course to-day. There was
a puffy northwester of fifteen miles'
strength blowing when the starting sig
nal was given at- 11:30. The Reliance was
first to cross the line. The Constitution
crossed soon after, and the Columbia fol
lowed a couple of seconds behind the
handicap gun, at 11:32.
The Constltutipn ran by the Reliance
shortly after the start and at 11:40, when
the Columbia was almost on even terms
with her, the Reliance set the spinnaker
flying on the starboard hand, new
boat felt the effect immediately and slow
ly regained the stretch of water that
separated her from the Constitution. A
mile from the turn the Reliance got by
the Constitution "and turned the mark
just ahead of her.v Meantime, the Colum
bia had fallen away in the rear.
The yachts turned the outer mark as
follows: Reliance, 1:10:05; Constitution,
1:10:31; Columbia, 1:14:38.
From the showing of the three- boats
this season, the Reliance is fairly entitled
to be the defending vessel. In any case,
she has crossed the finish line ahead, and
has lost but few events on time allow
ance. It Is probable that the defender
will proceed to Bristol for a thorough
overhauling.
Messrs. Morgan, of the Columbia, and
Belmont, of, the Constitution, were per
fectly satisfied with the Reliance's choice
by the committee. They are both of the
opinion that the Reliance is the fastest
of the trio.
NEWPORT, R. I., July 27.â After to
day's race between Reliance, Constitution
and Columbia, in which the former boat
again- demonstrated her superiority over
the other two, the challenge committee of
the New York Yacht Club selected the
Reliance as the defender of the America's
cup. It was also decided to discontinue
the trial races.
Miss Reibensteln gave a full account of
her experiences during the ordeal through
which she went with the drink-crazed
man. She said:
With Mrs. rtenham I attended the Tivoli
Theater last night. When we came out we
were met by Mr. Hewlett, with whom I ha.vÂ«
Upon her statement the police were
again communicated with and Policeman
Paul Butler was sent to Hewlett's apart
ments and took 'him to the Hall of Jus
tice. At first he was held In detinue, but
later Miss Reibensteln swore out a com
plaint against hhn on the charge of as
sault with intent to do great bodily harm,
and Jordan swore to another complaint
accusing him of battery. On the^e two
charges he was booked and later released
on cash ball of $100 in each of the cases.
YOUNG WOMAN'S STORY.
" Several hours afterward, when her cap
tor had fallen asleep, Miss Reibensteln
managed to make her escape, and re
turned to Mrs. Benham's apartments in
an almost fainting condition. â¢ There
were heavv bruises on her throat and
neck, bearing out her statement that she
had been choked Into submission by Hew
lett. She could scarcely speak and her
tongue was swollen to twice its natural
size, due, she said, to the fact that he
had forced his fingers into her mouth to
etifle her screams.
MAKES HER ESCAPE.
Despite the assurances of all those
present that Miss Reibensteln hod been
forced to accompany Hewlett against her
will these policemen concluded it was not
a case for their interference,- drove
everybody away from the house and left
the girl to her fate.
Through the closed doors Hewlett as
serted^that the girl was there of her own
volition, and according to her Story
Hewlett choked her into an acquiescence
in this statement. Mrs. Benham Insisted
that the girl v/as being detained there by
force, and the men started to leave to call
the police. As Jordan turned tp walk
down the steps Hewlett threw open the
door and struck him two cowardly blows
on the back, which, however, did no in
jury.
A telephone message was sent to the
City Hall and half a dozen policemen
were sent to the scene. They demanded
admittance to the room, but were refused
by Hewlett. Again, according to the girl,
Hewlett choked her and forced her to tell
the patrolmen that she was in his apart
ments of her own free will. Under the
circumstances all the policemen except
TIerney and Cashin withdrew. They re
mained, and under the urglngs of the ex
cited neighbors, who feared that Hewlett
might kill the girl, telephoned to head
quarters and received orders to break
open the door if they thought the woman
was a prisoner.
Hewlett is cashier of the First National
Bank at Stockton, and has been in this
city for the last week on a vacation. Mis3
Reibensteln, who is ihe daughter of O. S.
Reibenstein, Assistant Superintendent of
Streets of Stockton, came down from
Stockton Saturday and was visiting with
her friend, Mrs. Benham, at 1127 O'Farrell
street. James L.~-Dutton, landlord of the
fiat, and Leopold Jordan, a newspaper
man residing there, were aroused by the
woman's screams and the resulting com
motion, and at the request of Mrs. Ben
ham they went to the apartments occu
pied by Hewlett at 1124 O'Farrell street
and demanded the release of Miss Reiben
steln. r-jl* V
This almost incredible story of the
abused girl is borne out by other resi
dents in the flat at 1127 O'Farrell street
and people living in neighboring houses,
who were awakened by her screams. For
two hours the fashionable section was In
a turmoil. Women stood at the windows
and screamed "murder," and many gath
ered on the street below and watched in
terror the abortive attempts to liberate
the imprisoned girl.

Frank Case, another of the fugitive con

the Alameda County Jail, where he was
awaiting trial on a charge of robbing a

in Los Angeles for robbery and sent to

TROOPS IN PURSUIT.
A detachment of the hospital corps of
the Second Regiment arrived at Folsom
City on this evening's regular passenger
train, bringing with them a complete hos
pital equipment. It is realized by every,
one there that much blood will be shed
before the murderous escaping convicts
are captured or killed. Captain H. H.
Look is in charge of the hospital corps.
Colonel Seymour and his staff proceeded
to Folsom prison and held a consultation
with Warden Wilkinson and his officers.
It was decided to hold the trooos in
readiness to proceed as soon as some def
inite word was received from some of the
posses that are scouring the country. All
kinds of rumors filled the air here, and it
was seen that It would be a wild goose
chase to send the troops helter skelter on
mere rumors. The posses from Folsom
Prison and Folsom City are under the
charge of Frank Lockhard, chief of the
second watch, and Charles L. Taylor,
foreman of the rock crusher. They are
determined men and will leave nothing
undone to capture or kill the escaped con
victs and rescue the guards whom they
forced along. The thirteen convicts who
have escaped are listed on the prison
book as follows: â¢
Albert Seavls (colored), from Sacramen
to, 25 years for robbery; J. L. Woods, trom
San Francisco, life term for robbery: R.

years for burglary; Harry Eldrldge, from

from Contra Costa County, 14 years for
robbery; James Roberts, from Sacramen

Los Angeles, life term for robbery. â¢
OFFICIALS ABE RELEASED.
The band of convicts, with the officers
they had captured, first made for the
prison orchards and the hill adjoining. At
the foot of the hill Warden Wilkinson
was released. The party took to the
wagon road leading to the Mormon Island
bridge and crossed the south fork of the
American River at Mormon Island bridge.
Before reaching the- bridge they released
Captain Murphy and Stenographer Wil
kinson.
â¢'At the. bridge Guard Tom Ryan was on

once. Telephone messages were sent to
Governor Pardee at Sacramento asking
for troops to help the guards and Sher
iffs. Messages were sent to the Sheriffs
of El Dorado, Sacramento and Placer
counties giving them the news of the
outbreak and telling the direction the con
victs had taken. Dr. Hanna of Sacra
mento came on here from Sacramento in
his automobile : to render aid to the
wounded officers of the prison.

Sacramento bringing Dr. G. I* White,

On 'the arrival Â«f the, special train at

over to the prison in teams that were in

up a. supply of rifles, shotguns, revolvers

Baved the life of the officer and forced
Seavis to desist In his plan of murder.
The experiences of the officers who had
been released were listened to with deep
interest by the guards and officials at
Folsom and it was soon realized that tlie
leaders of the desperate band consisted of
Albert Seavis, the colored convict, R. M.
Gordon and J. L. Woods. Albert Â¦ Seavis
was sentenced from Sacramento for
twenty-five years for robbery; R. H. Gor
don Is under sentence of forty-five years
for robbery In Sacramento, and J. L.

bery committed in San Francisco.
ALARM FBOM PRISON.
Guard Jolly had two narrow escapes for
his life to-day. When the outbreak took
place in the prison yard Jolly was slashed
across the collar with a razor In the
hands of Convict Howard. Howard made
a second rush at Jolly, but he was pre
vented from killing the officer by tho In
tervention of Convict Frank Case. When
the escaping band of convicts were in the
woods beyond Mormen Island bridge, Al
bert Seavis, the colored convict, and one
of -the ringleaders of the band, told his
fellow convicts that he was going to
shoot the "top of the head of Guard Jolly
into little bits." Seavis leveled a riflj at
Shortly after Wilkinson arrived at
the prison the figures of Captain of the
Guard Murphy and Stenographer Harry
Wilkinson were seen in the distance. Cap
tain Murphy was minus his trousers and
Harry Wilkinson was attired in his un
derclothes, the convicts having forced
them to take off their outer^ garments for
their own use In evading arrest.
By 9 o'clock Captain Murphy was back
In his office, where the bloody encounter
had taken place two hours previous. The
hurried statements made by Captain Mur
phy and young Wilkinson to the Warden
showed that ' the convicts had released
fhem about half a mile beyond the bridge
leading to Mormon Island. Shortly after
Captain Murphy and young Wilkinson ar
rived at the prison they were followed by
Master Mechanic Ward and Guard Jolly.
Ward was forced to give up his clothes
by the convicts and to don prison garb,
but he was not molested.
RETURN OF WARDEN.
The Warden at once set about to bring
order out of chaos. He told the guards
that the convicts had forced the officers
they had captured to change clothes with
them, and the last the Warden saw of
the band the convicts were dressed In
guards' uniforms and the guards were at
tired In the gray-striped prison suits.
The convicts had released the Warden
and when he left them the band was
heading for Mormon Island, about a mile
from the prison in a direct line taken by
the escaping prisoners.
Half an hour after the outbreak had oc
curred the guards in the watch towers
saw the figure of Warden Wilkinson com
ing over the hill. He was without a hat
and he walked as if In great pain. Some
of the guards ran to his aid and quickly
helped him to enter the prison reserve
and reach his house.
Inside the prison all was uproar and
alarm. The hundreds of prisoners in Fol
som shouted and yelled at the top of
their voices, but they made no attempt to
break for liberty, when the remaining
guards drove them Inside the big stone
habitation for criminals. But there was
no cool head to direct affairs or do any
thing to give a general alarm or send
men to run down and pursue the mur
derers who had made their escape.

ficial dispatches from Prison Director J.

time of the outbreak and who went at
once to Folsom Prison and took charge
during the absence of Warden Wilkinson:
"Folsom Prison, 12:20 p. m.â R. M. Fitz

going out a desperate break was made by
the convicts. They overpowered Warden
Wilkinson, Captain Murphy and several
other officers and mortally wounded Ben
C. Cochrane and Guard Cotter. The con
victs were armed with knives. With the

The second dispatch arrived Â»t 730 n m
and reads:
BISECTOR WTLKINS BUSY.
Member of thÂ» State Board at Scene
of Trouble.
A portion of the National Guard regi
ment from Placerville went from that
city toward Georgetown and Auburn,
which are situated above Coloma. With
the posses from Folsom prison and the
National Guardsmen who are driving rap
idly in the trail of the convicts, It is esti
mated that the convicts will be surround
ed on all sides by daybreak. It is feared,
however, that the desperate band may
scatter in the night, which is Intensely
dark, and that the morning will find them
In all directions. Thn country in which
the convicts are to-night Is very .hilly and
rough. There is plenty of timber and
many ranches are. to be found. If the
convicts scatter or divide into twos and
threes the work 'of running them down
will be a very difficult one-
A later report, at 10:30 to-night, comes
from the Sheriff at Placerville. The Sher
iff telephenes that the stage driver who
drives between Placerville and Coloma
has just arrived at Placerville and that he
reports the band of convicts to be head-
Ing south from Pilot Hill toward Coloma,
which is : situated on the South Fork of
the American River. Messages have been
sent to the few residents at Coloma to
arm themselves and to give battle to the
desperate band of convicts.' A posse from
Placerville is heading toward Coloma and
is likely to .meet the band of convicts at
that point.
Telephone reports to-night are to the
effect that the prison posses also caught
up with the convicts at Pilot Hill at 7:30
this evening and a battle was fought at
that point. Convict Howard is reported to
have been killed by the pursuers and the
colored convict, Seavls, Is said to have
been wounded' In the leg.
Stage Driver Brown, who is attached to
the prison, and who was one of the cap
tured officers, is also reported to have
been wounded. Seavls and Driver Brown
are now reported to be dying at a small
hotel at Pilot Hill. These telephone mes
sages came to Warden Wilkinson from
Sheriff Kenna at Auburn, who received
the messages at that city by telephone
from the station at Cool.
CONVICT IS KILLED.
wagon road. Ryan fired three shots at
the convicts as they crossed the bridge,
but failed to hit any of them. In
the excitement that followed the shots
Guard Vertress dropped over a rock into
the river and made his escape by swim
ming under the bridge.
The convicts then proceeded up ' the
wagon road toward Niggtr Hill, which Is
about three-quarters of a mile from Mor
mon Island bridge. At this point they
raided a farm and looted the place for
clothing and valuables. They securfd a
four-horse team from Joe Foster, a Por
tuguese, and forced him to drive them
and their captives along the road toward
Bear Mountain, which Is seven miles
from Nigger Hill. On their way they met
a teamster, William Slotman, who had a
load of wood. They compelled the guards
to unload the wood and took Slounan's
horse's. They then stole the wagon and
team, but decided to abandon the wagon
and hitched the team of Slotman to those
they already had in their possession.
They continued on the wugon road to
Bald Mountain and on reaching the foot
of the mountain they abandoned the wag
on, road and took a straight cut across
the country toward Pilot Hill, which Is
about six miles from Bald Mountain. The
convicts were heading east with a slight
bearing toward the north and at Pilot
Hill were intercepted by a posse that had
been traveling due south from the city of
Auburn.
VIEW IN* FOLSOM PRISON WHERE MUCH OF THE TROUBLE OCCURRED
WHEN THE THIRTEEN DESPERATE CONVICTS MADE THEIR WAY
OUT OF THE PENITENTIARY WITH WARDEN AND OFFICERS.
With the key to the armory in their
possession the convicts quickly opened the
door to the room where rifles, revolvers
and ammunition were stored. Ten rifles
and fifteen revolvers were taken and a
large quantity of cartridges. Having
armed themselves, the convicts destroyed
the rifles and revolvers that they did not
need in order to hamper the men whom
they knew would soon be on their track.
With the rifles over tbelr shoulders and
with revolvers stuck Into the bosoms of
their shirts or in their trousers pockets,
the thirteen convicts marched along the
hill leading through the prison orchard.
They were right in line of fire of the
deadly Gatling guns, but the guards on
duty In the watch towers were hp*plÂ«*s.
With dcji despair, the guards knew
that to turn the Gatllng sruns on the
hand of escaping cutthroats meant the
death of the Innocent officers whom the
desperadoes had forced along as a shield
from the weapons to prevent escape from
the prison. The guards in the watch-
Meanwhile the band of escaped convicts
had arrived at the base of the armory
tower. There were eight guards in the
armory at the time, and they had locked
the door. A demand was made by the con
vict* that the door be opened, and If this
Â«rder was not complied with the despera
does threatened to blow the armory and
Its occupants to eternity. Through the
wir.dowB the guards on the inside saw
that they were powerless to prevent the
escape of the convicts or to aid Warden
Wilkinson and his associate officers.
Guard D. E. Wiley threw the key to the
armory out of the window when he saw
the convicts were getting ready to Ignite
sticks of dynamite that they had in their
hands.
While this action was in progress the
balance of the guards In the inner yard

tain, leaving 400 and more convicts in the
open space of the yard. The Gatllng guns
in the towers were trained on the Inner
prison yard. The hundreds of prisoners
rushed Into the prison proper and the
work of locking them up was at once
commenced.
As soon as the thirteen convicts were
outside the gate they ran up the narrow
lane toward the outer yard. Genera:
Overseer McDonough was caught In this
lane and added to the unwilling party ot
officers in the midst of the convict band.
The next point to be advanced upon was
the armory, situated in the base of one
of the tall stone sentry watch towers.
:-tood in the yard, the murderers marched
toward the gate, well knowing that the
presence of Warden Wilkinson and the
other officials in their midst prevented
the guards in the Eentry towe?B from
turning their rifles and Gatlir-g guns upon
them. One guard fired a shot, but as
soon as he saw that the Warden and
other officers were prisoner?, he desisted.
Walking to the prison gate of the innei
yard the bar.d of convicts arrived at the
locked gat*'. Guard James Dylan was on
the other side of the cate from the con
victs and he was called upon to open the
gate. When he hesitated the band of con
victs who had U ai <ien Wilkinson and
his officers In their power, called out that
they would kill the Warden and his com
rades unless the gate was opened. Dolan
reluctantly opened the gate and with a
yell of victory the convicts passed
through the opening, closely holding their
former guardians. Dolan was forced
along by the band.

Facing tht
Convicts who are reported for insubor
dination or other offenses are supposed
to fall out from the marching line and
range themselves ia front of the door of
the captain's office. Then thess offenders
are called into the office one by one. and
1 heir cases are exajnined by the Warden,
assisted by the other officials. This
morning when the 400 convicts had
marched into the yard, without the
slightest warning the break for liberty
was made. The thirteen desperadoes who
had hatched the plot suddenly fell out of
the Ior:g line of prisoners and in less than
ten seconds they had rushed into the
captain's office, brandishing knives and
razors, which they had pulled from their
peckcts.
In an instant the fight was on. Warden
Wilkinson was surrounded by the desper
ate men and one of them slashed him
fiercely across the body with a razor. Tfie
J^alar.ce of the officers in the room were
t-afcily captured. Captain of the Guard
Axurphy trjfd to escape into an inner
room, but "Big Gordon." a life-term pris

threatened to cut his htart out if he
moved another step.
The noire of the uproar reached the ears
of the guards who were out in the prison
>ard. Guard Cotter rushed into the cap
tain's room and bravely tried to quell
the mutiny. He brandished his heavy
club, but the odds were against him. He
was ect upon by ihe desperadoes and was
literally cut to pieces.
Guard Cochrane also rushed into the
rootn. scixrd a chair and set about to
help Cotter. He was also fearfully cut
about the entire body and only a miracle

looked like a elaughter-house after the

did bo proves that either an unusual
amount of secrecy, was observed by the
convicts, or some one was culpably negli
"The fact is" that such a prison deliv
ery could never have been successfully
carried out if the prison had been sur
rounded by a wall as it should be. Ever
since I have been on the board I have
continually agitated the need of such a
wall, which can be erected at compara
tively small expense to the State. All
that the State needs to supply is the
"tools and the cement. We have the labor
and granite to build a wall which would
render the escape of prisoners impossible,
even though all the, convicts in the insti
tution should mutiny and murder every
officer in charge; They would still be in
side the wall and under cover of the gat
ling guns in the towers, and the rifles of
the guards, whom it would be absolutely
Impossible for them to reach.
"The problem which must be solved first
of all Is how to recapture the escaped
convicts without sacrificing the lives of
the free men whom they hold as hostages.
There Is no doubt that they will all be
killed or captured sooner or later, but if
they are cornered they may kill every
one of their prisoners before being over
come. It is" possible that they may sepa
rate to-night, and' if they do they will
have to release the captives. If they keep
together their capture is certain, but it
may cost the live* of the officers, and this
must be avoided if possible."
When asked about the rumor that War
den Wilkinson may Have ordered the
guards in the tower not to</lre on the es
caping convicts. Mr. Fitzgerald said:
"The Warden was in a very trying po
sition. He had not only his own life to
think of, but the lives of the other men
In the hands of the convicts, amonj
whom was his own grandson. Had he
ordered the guards to open flre he prob
ably would have been killed on the spot,
and the rest of theÂ» hostages with him.
And it may be that the guards themselves
feared that if they fired on the escaping
convicts the public would condemn them
for sacrificing the lives of nearly a dozen
free men to prevent the escape of thirteen
prisoners when there was a possibility of
recapturing them later without endanger
ing the lives of the prison officers.
"It Is very easy -to Â»Â«Â« how such a
thing might be prevented after It has
taken place, but at present I do not know
where to place the blame. It is hard to
understand how the officers could be taken
unaware-i and made prisoners, but it Is

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 28, 1903.
Jk TEVADA, July 27.â Captain Bost of Company C, Second
jf.V Regiment, .. National Guard of California, received in
structions from the capital this afternoon to have his men
ready at 5 o'clock this evening to take the trail of the escaped
convicts from Folsom. During the afternoon couriers were
kept busy going to the different mines hereabouts, and by 5
o'clock, with one exception, every member of the company, sixty
five strong, was present with arms, forty rounds of< ammunition
and in full, marching uniform. At 5 o'clock orders came to
keep the soldiers at the barracks in readiness to go to the front.
Since that time a special,train has been kept waiting to start at a
moment's notice. The members of the company are hardy moun
taineers, most of them miners arid good marksmen, and they are
eager for the summons to join in the pursuit of the convicts.

JjACRAMENTO. July 27.â A deter
mined effort was made to assassin
ate Warden Wilkinson. One of the
conspirators came up behind him in
the office of the Captain of the
Guard, and drew a razor across his ab
domen. There can be no question \hat it
was his design to disembowel the War
den, as was done with Guard William
Cotter. The Warden wore a white vest
of a heavy ribbed material which resisted
the keen blade, but this vest was cut
across his abdomen, as was also the
woolen coat which he wore.
The Warden made Hght of his experi
ence and would not believe he was
wounded until several hours afterward,
when he was Induced to remove his cloth
ing so as to enable an examination to be
made. It was then seen that the razor
had cut slightly into his flesh, but not
deeply enough to cause serious injury.
The Warden's wounds were dressed and
he said they gave him no pain. Warden
Wilkinson gave the following version of
his thrilling experience:
"A bout, 6:45 o'clock this morning I left
my residence to go up to the prison proper
and see the convicts at breakfast. This
is my regular practice, aifd on the occa
sion of these visits I never go armed
even with so much as a walking stick.
After seeing the men at their breakfast I
walked back into the captain's office near
the entrance. It is my habit to wait there
until all the men have come .from their
breakfast, and if any have misbehaved
we hold a sort of court there and decide
upon what punishment shall be meted out
to the offenders.
ATTACK BY HOB.
"I was thus sitting in the office with
Captain R. J. Murphy, my rrandson,
Harry Wilkinson, and several others, all
unarmed like myself, when seven or
eight convicts rushed in armed with
knives and razors, and started In to
overpower us and they -were quickly
Joined by half a dozen other convicts, so
that In my judgment there were about
fourteen in all. The convicts slashed
right and left with their knives and
razors and soon blood was flowing in all
directions. I saw that it was no use to
put up a fightâ that if we fought back, un
armed as we were, we would have been
slain on the spot. The convicts overcame
Murphy and myself and several other of
ficers in the room.
"I was conscious of some one among the
number coming up behind me and, reach-
Ing down with his knife or razor, seek to
cut open my abdomen, and you can see
the silt of the knife. It was an ugly
thrust, but it did not do me any injury.
P. J. Cochrane, the turnkey, came Into
the office in the midst of the trouble and
he pitched Into the convicts with his cane,
brandishing it right and left, but he was
overmatched and was stabbed and cut' in
a frightful manner, and it was in this des
perate encounter, that poor William Cot
ter, the guard, received the wounds that
resulted In his death. The convicts, armed
with their knives, forced us to accompany
them out of the room. Some ' of ! the
guards who man the Gatling guns in the
turrets heard and saw the confusion and
one or two shots were fired by them."
"I gave the signal . to - them, however,
not to fire at us, for I knew It could mean

REDDING. July rr.â The -courage and
determination of Deputy Constable Van
Horn alone prevented Ed Fidler being
lynched by a mob of Indignant citizens
!aÂ«t night at Sisson. and although Fidler
is now safely behind the bars of the Sis
Â«on jail, there is nothing certain about his
not after all becoming the victim of mob
violence. Fidler drank heavily Sunday
evening, staggered Into the front door of
his house, went Into the bedroom where
his wife was, locked the door behind him,
and attacked his wife, beating her in a
most brutal and Inhuman manner. He
had a large knife and was attempting to
tse it on his unconscious victim when she
was rescued.
The eldest daughter gave the alarm.
Deputy Constable Van Horn hastened to
the scene. He could hear the racket be
ins' made by Fidler and the groans and
sobs cf his victim. He broke down the
door and entered as Fidler was in the act
of using )iis knife. Van Horn grappled
with Fldior and after a short f.pht hand
cuffed him and took h!m to the jail.
A large crowd pat he re \ about the jail
and declared their intentions of hanging
Fidler to the nearest tree. They sent for
a rope and attempted to compel Van Horn
to surrender the keys to the lock-up. He
Jjravoly stood his ground, faced the mob
and refused to give then his prisoner. A
few cool heads in th< : crowd finally per
suaded the would-be lynchers to leave
and Fifiler was !cft to the mercy of the
law.
â¢ Indignation is running high and it is
certain that if he is not given the full ex
tent of the law the people will allow no
interference in the next attempt to take
the law Into their own hands. They de
clare that Fidler shall suffer for his

by neighbors and is being cared for. She
will recover.

throat, but she escaped and ran to Kennet
and pave an alarm. Men rushed to Fid

him killing his Â¦wife. A mob at that time
took him to a hill near by and came very

AT'Mr. Bryan's Chicago meeting Mayor Hai<
rison was formally nominated for the Presi
dency. The Chronicle, the only Democratic
paper in that city, calls him "the mushy Mayor" and
proceeds to prove that the procession in honor/' of
Mr. Eryan was made up of city employes who serve
under the mushy. Mayor. The Chronicle also calls
attention to the present 'condition of Chicago, in the
hands of mobs, which have already done one murder
and threaten more, while the mushy Mayor looks
on, because to run with the mob may make votes
when they are needed.
From this icy reception of the new candidate by
his party organ one may conclude that his prospects
are not brilliant. But this conclusion is probably
incorrect, since trie people upon whom the mushy
Mayor relies donot read the paper, and if they did
would not comprehend the motives to which it ap
peals. Therefore we are justified in saying that the
mushy Mayor stands a chance, and Mr. William

FROM the Bureau of Statistics of the Depart
ment of Commerce there has just been issued a
bulletin showing the trade of the last fiscal
year with our colonial possessions. It is to be noted,
however, that the department does not speak of them
as "possessions," nor as "colonies," but as "the non
contiguous territory of the United States." The fig
ures show that down to the close of May the trade for
the eleven months amounted to $86,581,026, and it is
estimated that when the June trade is added the
total for the year will not fall far short of
$100,000,000.
Of the trade of the eleven months for which com
plete figures are given the imports were something
more than $53,000,000, and the exports of merchan
dise $33,080,779. Of the exports it is said a little over
$11,000,000 went to Porto Rico, $10,000,000 to the
Hawaiian Islands, $8,000,000 to Alaska, a little over
$3,500,000 to the Philippines, and nearly $100,000
worth to Guam and-Tutuila. Of the $55,000,000 of
merchandise received from the non-contiguous terri
tory during the eleven months nearly $22,000,000
worth 1 came from the Hawaiian Islands, $11,000,000
from the Philippines, $10,500,000 from Porto Rico
and $10,000,000 from Alaska. This $10,000,000 re
ceived from Alaska is merchandise and does not in
clude the gold .received from that Territory, which
amounted in the eleven months to $4,540,677.
The articles of import cover a wide variety of
products, but are mainly raw material.. The principal
items with their respective values are thus stated:
"From the Hawaiian Islandsâ Sugar amounted to
$21,000,000 in value; coffee, $225,029; hides and skins,
$69,171; and fruits and nuts, $67,510. From Porto
Ricoâ Sugar. $6,997,644; tobacco and manufactures
thereof. $1,813,642 (of which $1,681,608 is- cigars);
coffee. $712,090; and fruits and nuts, $281,842. From
the Philippine Islandsâ Manila hemp, $10,668,657;

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
MORE or less opposition to the establishment
and maintenance of forestry reserves . has
been manifest ever since the policy of re
serving forest land here and there where needed for
the public good was adopted by the Government. As
a rule, however, the opposition has come only from
persons without official station, and in most" cases
from individuals having no more than a local . in
fluence. It is therefore a matter of some moment
when the Governor of Wyoming makes a public pro
test against the forest reserves in that State. It. is
a sign thst the opponents of the policy are becoming
formidable and feel themselves strong enough to
make an open fight.
It is of course not'surprising *hat there should be
some opposition. The old saying, "It is .an ill wind
that blows good to nobody," is of universal appli
cation. There has never been an evil among men
that did not benefit some one and around which there
did not grow up considerable class interests. So
long as the Government made no attempt to pre
serve its forests in any part of the country, and men
were free to waste them as their interests or their
carelessness prompted, it became a custom for a good
many men to make free use of them and to reap a
profit from them. The adoption of the policy of re
serving and protecting some of the vast forest domain
of the Government interferes with that custom and
engenders antagonism. Naturally enough as the pol
icy of reservation has been extended the opposition
has been increased, and now it shows itself in high
official circles.
The Governor of Wyoming is reported to have
based his objection to the system mainly upon the
fact that it excludes the grazing of sheep on 'the
reservations in that State. He is quoted as saying
that the right of grazing on the foothills and in the
parks on the slopes of the mountains is absolutely
necessary to the sheep industry, and he insists that
the Government should restore that privilege to the
herders. It happens, however, that experience has
shown that sheep are more injurious to a forest than
anything else short of fire. To open the forest re
serves to sheep in unlimited numbers and at the will
of any one who chooses to drive them there would
be to nullify the whole forest policy.
Moreover, the assertion that the* free use of the
forests is necessary to the sheep-grazing industry is
not strictly accurate. If a proper system of con
serving the grazing lands were adopted by the Goy
crnment, and the sheep and the cattle men were
given inducements to preserve the grass rather than
to destroy it, there would be grazing room enough
without sacrificing the reserved forests. The issue is
yearly becoming more and more important, and ac
cordingly the demonstration of an increasing oppo
sition to forest preservation should not be overlooked
by those who understand the far-reaching problems
that are involved in the question.
THE FORESTRY QUESTION
A c?se has recently arisen in Washington which
involves the claim of labor unions to a superiority
over the law. Mr. Miller, assistant foreman of the
Government Printing office, for personal reasons
was expelled from the Bookbinders' Union, of which
he had been a member. His office was held under
the civil service law, but upon the demand of the
Bookbinders' Union, backed by Mr. Gompers and
the American Federation of Labor, Mr. Palmer,
Government Printer, dismissed him from his office.
Upon sn appeal to the President through the Civil
.Service Commission Mr. Miller was reinstated, his
dismissal having been in defiance of his rights and in
violation of the law.
Immediately upon his legal reinstatement the
president of the Bookbinders' Union announced
that his and all the affiliated union* in the Govern
ment employment would strike and walk out unless
he were again dismissed. This raises the same issue
that was made in the railway service on the gov
ernment roads of Australia. It is raised, however, in
a much more serious aspect. The mistake made by
the bookbinders and affiliated unions is that they
alone are superior to the law. The President and
every member of his Cabinet, and* every Presidential
ippointee and every private citizen, must obey that
law. None are above it and none are below it. It
is as binding as any statute of the republic. Its vio
lators are subject to civil and penal punishment.
They stand no better before the law than the vio
lators of the statutes -.vhich forbid and punish coun
terfeiting and piracy, misuse of the mails or. em
bezzlement of public property. Yet the unions de
mand that the law be defied and nullified when it
stands between them and their desire for personal
This issue is sharply made. They have no more
right to demand Miller's expulsion from the ser
vice because he has ceased to be a member of his
union than the Masons, Catholics or Methodists
have to make like demand for the punishment of
apostacy from either organization. Yet the feder
ated trades deliberately propose to force the estab
lishment of the rule that the labor unions enjoy im
munity denied to nil others. If this right be estab
lished there is no law r which may not be defied in the
same way.
This is the serious aspect above that presented by
the Australian strike. There the unions in* the be
ginning did not violate a law of the colony, but de
fied an administrative regulation. The colony ended
the strike by passing a law, which the various unions
wisely respected. It may be said with perfect sin
cerity that the people in this country who in the
Jong run will suffer most from violation of the law
are the wage-workers themselves. Under the inspira
tion of such leaders as Mr. Gorapers they fail to see
this now. But later on that inspiration will fail to
protect them against the consequences of their as
sumed superiority to the law of the land. They will
learn that the law cannot be violated for the sup
posed benefit of one class without lifting its obliga
tion from all, and that means anarchy.
IX the investigation of the Postoffice Department
now in progress among the offenses charged and
for which officials have been dismissed are vio
lations of the civil service law. These violations con-
MÂ«t in :he illegal removal and the illegal appointment
of persons in the civil service. The law absolutely
protects the entry into the civil service and guards
the right* oi all therein whose expulsion is attempted
by their superiors. They can^be expelled only on
charges, of which they are furnished a copy, and
after ample time in which to defend at a formal
hearing. The civil service law is as much a part of
our system as the constitution itself, and its viola
lion is as serious a matter as the defiance of any
other law of the land.

health. "The climate made me % too fat."
he said yesterday, "but most of the other

Finley Burke, senior member of the law
firm of Burke, Harl & Tinley, who under
went an operation for appendicitis on
Thursday, died a few minutes after 2
o'clock this afternoon in the Sisters of
Mercy Hospital. His wife and children
and a few Intimate friends for whom he
bad asked during his last hours were at
his bedside when he passed away.
A few days ago Mr. Burke was appar
ently in the best of health and his death
came- as a great shock to his many friends
and acquaintances in the city, and espe
cially to the members of the legal frater
nity, as he has been considered one of
Iowa's leading attorneys for many years.
Ho was taken 111 suddenly last Wednes
day morning and on Thursday his condi
tion became so alarming that it was
deemed advisable to remove him from his
residence on Oakland avenue to Mercy
Hospital,- where, during the afternoon, he
was operated on for appendicitis. The
operation was complicated by a small rup
ture contracted last year, and from the
time he went under the surgeon's knife
little hope was held out for his recovery.
He held his own, however, until Sunday
morning, when he gradually grew weaker
until his death.
Mr. Burke was about 50 years old and a
pioneer of Iowa.

Senator Fairbanks, Senator Beveridge and others,
of a like caliber and position are as averse to taking
the nomination as is Aldrich himself. It will of
course go to some one in the West, but it will hardly
go to any one in the Senate who has a fair assurance
of retaining his seat. Of course the candidate -must
be big enough lo satisfy the public that he would
make a fit President should any chance bring him to
that office. There is then a good opportunity here
for the West to present a new man to the nation.
California has several men who would fill the office
with honor and credit, and it is by no means im
probable that one of them may obtain it. Roosevelt
of course would gladly have a man from the extreme
West on the ticket with him, and there is no other
State west of the Mississippi that better deserves the
honor than California.
In short, 'the drift of speculation on the subject in
the East tends to the conclusion that there will be
no very earnest fight there for. the. place. . It .will be
conceded to the West, and it looks as if the Western
man whose, friends are : .first" to Â¦ organize for the
fight will win the prize.:. \ / v
POLITICAL, speculators of the Republican
party .are about as much at a loss to pick a
Vice .Presidential candidate as the Democrats
arc in their efforts .to select a candidate for the
Presidency. ( There is no lack of men eligible for
the office, but it appears there is . a sad lack s
of cligiblcs who are willing to accept it. â¢
Senator Platt of New York recently suggested
Senator Aldrich of Rhode Island as the right man
for the place, but the suggestion has been received
as something of a joke, and the "Easy Boss" has
been virtually requested to give the country spme
thing easier." Aldrich, it is admitted, would make an
excellent Vice President, but as the President is to
Â¦ be chosen from New York it is not at all likely that
the Vice President will be taken from what is practi
cally a New York suburb. Furthermore, Aldrich has
a seat in the Senate and is one of the most influential i
.of its members. He likes the work, and he would j
not like the purely ornamental position of Vice Presi- j
dent. Therefore Platt is supposed to have been jest- |
ing when he proposed the name of a man who could ;
not get the nomination if he wished it and would
not accept it if it were offered.

Special Dispatch to Th# Call
That an outbreak planned upon so large a scale
and undertaken with such boldness could be carried
through with such success may be surprising^ some
particulars, but concerning the revolt itself there will
be no surprise, -''it has long been known that insub
ordination exists at Folsom; that the management
has not been sufficiently strong to retain cither the
confidence. of the employes or command the ( re
spect and obedience of the convicts. The Warden
has shown a singular fondness for trusting dangerous
convicts with important duties and reposing in them
a foolish degree of trust.. He has said, and even
boasted, that he had more confidence in some of the
convicts than in some of the men employed to guard
and control them. Such statements have not been
unknown to the convicts themselves, and they have
been encouraged to take advantage of the easy
credulity of the Warden. The inevitable result has now
occurred, and the Warden is .left to gasp and stare
and wonder how it happened.
At San Quentin an equally bad if not a worse con
dition has prevailed for a long time. It has been
shown that in that prison the management was
guilty not enly of incompetence, but of downright
frauds. Documentary evidence has been submitted
in court proving forgery, falsification of records and
other serious offenses on the part of the Warden or
those who were in collusion with him. Such man
agement of course cannot retain the loyalty of the
employes, 'nor can it hold in rightful subordination
the convicts confined in the prison walls. Thus there
is constant danger of an outbreak in that prison, and
one may occur almost any day.
The officials "primarily responsible for this condi
tion of affairs are the members of the State Board
of Prison Directors. Upon them rests the duty of
supervising the prisons and of seeing to it that the
management is in proper hands. They have retained
incompetent men in office, knowing them to be in
competent. They Â»have retained at San Quentin a
Warden who has been proven in court to be guilty
of the grossest violations of law. They have re
tained him in office even though his term has expired,
and have thus tacitly condoned his offenses and made
themselves approvers of his conduct. Even when at
last they have decided to choose a new Warden,
they have left the discredited official in office for a
month in which to work such revenge as his spite
may dictate upon those of his subordinates whom
he may believe to have been opposed to his past mis
management and frauds.
The exposures made in the press have Jong since
opened the eyes of the people to the bad condition
of affairs at both prisons, and perhaps the outbreak
at Folsom will now open the eyes of the Prison*
Directors. They can no longer be blind to the
tendencies of bad management. They must now ad
mit that incompetence on the part of the higher of
ficers of the prisons leads to discontent among the
employes and among the convicts; that discontent
leads to disrespect, and that disrespect is followed by
insubordination, out of which come attempts at vio
lence and outbreak whenever the slightest opportun
ity of success offers.
The issue in the case therefore runs directly to the
Board of Prison Directors. They have delayed and
dilly-dallied a long time instead of taking action at
once to remove worthless officials as soon as their
worthlessness was proven, but it is now hardly pos
sible for them to further defy public sentiment. It
is probable, therefore, that the Folsom outbreak may
prove of value to the State by compelling a thor
ough revision of our prison management. What has
been done is bad enough, but it might have been
wor?e. At an/ rate the object lesson has been given
on a scale of sufficient magnitude to startle the State,
and the demand upon the Prison Directors for
prompt and efficient action can no longer be safely
evaded or ignored.
f\ F the outbreak of convicts at Folsom it may
( * 1 be said the expected has happened. The
V-V people of California have long been aware
that the management of our State prisons is in the
hands of incompetent men. The fact has been ex
posed again and again by The Call and by the
press generally. Legislative investigations have
shown the truth of the statements of the prgss, and
documentary evidence has been forthcoming to con
firm it. Nevertheless the Board of Prison Direct
ors have retained in office and maintained in power
the men known to be unfit for the place.

There were two opinions, the first in the
case of the Gulf Bag Company vs. Mich
ael Suttner and others, and the second in
the case of Michael Hallanan vs. Jour
neymen Horseshoeing Union Local No. 25
of San Francisco. The following is a
synopsis of the opinion Sn the bag com
pany case:
The rights of labor and the relation of
strikes and strikers to the law under a
constitutional form of* government were
discoursed upon yesterday from the
strictly legal point of view by United
States District Judge James H. Beatty of
Idaho, sitting in the United States Circuit
Court.
Judge Beatty Says That
They Are Opposed
to Law.
It Is an economic law that no class can long
prosper at the cost or by the oppression of other
classes, or one community long prosper at the
expense of others. Organizations exercise their
concentrated power as a unit. In this Is their
strength. It may be a power for evil as well
as good. The danger is that In exercising it
for the benefit of its membership it overlooks
the rights of others. " \
To avoid this the courts must see that they
are confined to the legitimate and rightful ex
ercise of their powers. Whenever any organ
ization, even for the bfim> fit of its members,
Â¦through Its control over them, by Injunction
upon or direction to them or by Its Influence
upon the public and its patrons). takes steps to
prevent others from enjoying any lawful occu
pation, in either labor or business,' or attempts
by concert of action to disparage the business
or goods of any one, or to prevent the public
from using or dealing In the goods of another,
or In other words, boycotting said goods. It acts
In violation of the law. if such can be done
as to one man's trade and goods. It may be
done as to another's, and so continue until all
competitors 'are out of the way, thus entailing
Injury not only upon the Individual, but also
upon 1 the public. This Is monopoly of the
worst character and Is most obnoxious to the
law. It. is Immaterial whether the monopoly
is of labor or of business. Neither Individual
nor organization of individuals ' can be pro
tected in It. â¢
But the law has been so often discussed and
Is too well understood by all classes to justify
any prolonged consideration of It here. ;
After a . consideration of all the facts and
circumstances . In â¢ this caso the conclusion
reached is that this matter should be heard
upon Its merits (where all witnesses may be
fully examined that the, truth may be known
and that In the meantime the existing restrain
ing order should not be disturbed, but be\con
tinueil, and It Is so ordered. -
DANGER OF UNIONISM.
Those who enter Into such organizations must
not forget that while. they may advance their
own Interests, they are under such obligations
to their fellow-men, their fellow-laborers that
they must not oppress them. Every man has
the right to labor at what and when he wishes
and to obtain the most therefor that ho can,
and in this he Is entitled to the protection of
the law and protection against any combina
tion or scheme to debar him of such right. Tne
law makes no distinction between the so-called
union and non-union laborers. All stand be
fore It with equal rights and entitled to like
protection. ~
All the facts and circumstances considered
leave upon my mind the Impression that de
fendants are united In their opposition to com
plainant's pad; that they use the influence of
the combined strength of their union with their
customers against the use of the pad; that they
fine their members who do use It. and this be
cause in his business he Is not employing union
labor. That they have the power to Injure
his business Is shown by the fact that It has
greatly decreased here since the defendants
commenced their opposition to it. One signifi
cant fact as to the power of the defendants is
the Incident In which a member of the union
tsked permission of the president of the union
to use some of complainant's pads which he
had on hand. Whether he simply gave per
mission to use them or added to that permission
the order to buy no more Is immaterial. The
suggestive fact is that he should be asked the
permission. â¢ â¢ â¢
POWER OF THE BOYCOTT.
Some facts are established beyond dispute.
One Is that the San Francisco union had adopt
ed a resolution or rule that a fine of $5 would
be inflicted upon any of Its members who would
use the pad. â¢ â¢ â¢
In over 80 per cent of the shops In San Fran
cisco, which shops use most of the pads used
in San Francisco; and that defendants have
directed the material that shall be used and
the men who shall be employed in such shops;
that they have forbidden the use of complain
ant's pads In any of such shops; that they
have combined and conspired to stop the sale
of his pads and threaten to continue to do so
In San Francisco and elsewhere unless he yields
to the demands of the New York union and
uses their label. â¢ â¢ â¢
The following is a synopsis of Judge
Beatty's opinion In the Horseshoers' boy
cott: " -
The complainant alleges that he manufac
tures In New York City a certain horseshoeing
pad, and that he operates in that city, a horse
shoeing shop: that in December. 1902, the
Journeymen Horseshoeing Union of New York
demanded that he use in his shoeing shop : the
stamp or label of the. International : Union of
the Journeymen, Horseshoeing, Union; that the
said San Francisco union has adopted a stamp,
*hr use of wblcb thav hÂ«m arhltrarllv Â«\nforrÂ«<l
Moreover, this restraining order does not de
prive any one of any right, nor require of him
any wrong. It" only requires that no : wrong
shall be committed, that no right. shall be in
fringed. The order can do no harm even if
not clearly and Â¦ absolutely Justified: but I
think the facts justify it, and, as it is made,
so it Is continued. > . â¢
NO BIGHT INFRINGED.
Fortunately in this case no extremely serious
results such as we are crowing somewhat ac
customed to, followed. It may have been the
interposition of the timely restraining order,
but of the fact that unlawful acts were done
the whole record of the case is convincing.
It was an effort on the part of the defence
to force higher wages for their associates by
unlawful Interference with the rights of .oth
ers to labor who were not associated with
them. All laboring people f,ully understand
that, whenever they please and for any cause,
they have the right to quit work. Whether
as individuals or as organizations they must
also understand that all men, whether asso
ciated with them or not, have equal rights
with them In the labor world. The right to
labor or to cease it must be as free to all as
It is to water to seek its level. This Govern
ment is one of liberty under the law and its
people are free men. Neither will tolerate the
attempt of any to enforce assumed rights by
crushing the Inalienable rights of others.
Until all recognize and obey that law the
contest must and will go on.
I think in the Interest of peace and law that
this restraining order should be continued. It
Is complained that It is too comprehensive In
that it Includes the members of both asso
ciations. There Is no question that the Cotton-
Bag Workers' Union Is Interested, for the strik
ing employes of complainant were members
thereofv The defendant ; Hanback. who is
president of this union, â¢ says In his affidavit
that the president* and secretary Interceded in
this matter to procure better wages for those
employes. As these organizations worked large
ly through their officers It is not extravagant to
conclude that both organizations took . more or
less interest in this contest.
One Individual case may be referred to. It
Is charged that Suttner was especially vile in
his conduct and In his use of language towar'l
the female, operative, Agnes Falltn. ile denies
it all and that he was present at the time
charged, fc'it her statements are so eonflrired
ty ethers that I prefer believing them to hU
der.la'.s.
In commenting upon the acts of vio
lence alleged in the complaint and denied
by the defendants, Judge Beatty said:
VIOLENCE MUST CEASE.
The law does give the right of peaceable
persuasion. It is abuse of this right which
leacis to all the tiouble. In their desire to
succeed they too often bo In great numbers.
Amors them ore generally some wao are law-
Jess and reckless of rights or consequences.
They do that which the conservative and bet
ter class do not approve, and the general re
sult is that the conscious power of great num
bers leads along from one act -to another to
the usual end that violence and abuse are
resorted to when advice and persuasion fall.
But It must be understood that when they as
semble In numbers for some object they must
be held responsible for what their associates
do whÂ«thÂ»r they approve of or advise It or not.
principal object of their union is, by mutual
arrangements with the emuloyers of Its mem
ber?, to secure satisfactory rates of wages and
to Improve the efficiency of Its members and
that It does not approve or tolerate violence
for any purpose." There Is 110 doubt that all
the written stated objects In their records of
organization are worthy and commendable,
but the question is not as to the objects of
their organization, stated 'or otherwise; it is
what they do. â¢ â¢ â¢
DECIDES AGAINST
THE BOYCOTTERS
"I have noticed several times during
the proceedings, Mr. Livernash," said
Moore, "that you have hinted about my
talking for the benefit of the press. Now
you know very well when we were ar
ranging the terms for the arbitration
proceedings that I was not in favor of
the . press being present at the hearing,
and you then said that if the press repre
sentatives were not allowed to be present
you would yourself give them all the
news at the end of each day. It was on
this account only that I allowed the press
to be present at the proceedings and let
me tell you that not now nor at any
other time have I been making speeches
to the press."
The case will be resumed this morning
at 10 o'clock. .
"AIL right, all right," said Livernash.
"Have your little say for the benefit of
the press."
There was one little tilt between At
torneys Moore and Livernash yesterday.
This occurred when Livernash went down
the list of laborers and asked Russell to
explain the conditions and aptitude of
his men. This course was objected to by
Moore, who said it was very embarras
sing for Russell as a "boss" to publicly
give an opinion of each of his men.
In the afternoon Russell was examined
at great length by" Livernash, the latter
trying to get the foreman to admit that
experience and knowledge enhanced the
value 'of the laborers under his control.
This Russell positively refused to do and
emphatically declared that the average
laborer working for the company was as
capable after one month's experience as
after he had been employed many years.
1 NOT SPEAKING FOB PRESS.
The machine known as the cast-w<>15!ng ma
chine has been'closed down for some time and
It Is problematical when the same will bÂ«r si^nin
put in operation. At present there are let in
the service of the company any men .aga^ed en
cast-welding outfits.
I have read the testimony of W. J. McLeod,
a laborer employed In my department. Jlc-
Leod is one of the fifty-two men who are
known as, and perform the duties of, common
laborers or handy men about the tracks.
Neither said McLeod nor any of the'flfty-*wo
men mentioned are called upon to clean the
channels of cable lines or to drive pulley wag
ons. At times McLeod and the fifty-two men
aforesaid do use ratchets, drills and backsaws,
gads and sledges for the purpose of sawing
rails and drilling holes In rails. Thev put
down tracks, curves and switches, but rever
a curve Is laid down or a cross-over placed by
them without the engineer of the company first
laying out the lines. The rails and cross-ov-irs
are prepared in the machine shops and a fore
man always supervises such laying of cross
overs, rails and curves. Except for some Â¦\<Â»rr
slight repair work, where one man may be *erÂ»t
to remedy a simple defect, all of the work per
formed by McLeod and the fifty-two men
aforesaid Is performed under the immediate su
pervision and direction of a foreman. 'ihesÂ«
fifty- two laborers repair holes in streets; tliclr
work Is steady from one year to the otner and
their average annual earnings are higher than
the average annual earnings of labors -a work
ing for contractors at $2 CO per day â this arm
ing from the fact that laborers working ftr
contractors are subject to trequent lay-offs,
while the fifty-two laborers in the employ or
this company are steadily employed.
Any handy laborer who never performed
work on a railroad is capable of taklnrr the
place of MeLeod or any one of The fifty-two
laborers aforesaid. If the fifty-two laborers
should quit their work to-morrow It wouM not
Inconvenience the company to the sllghte-i*. ex
tent, as their places could be filled in a cay.
Their work corresponds very largely with the
work of section men on steam roads, v-ho re
ceive from $1 60 to $1 75 per day. 7"ie work
performed by McLeod and his fifty -two asso
ciate* is much sought after, and at a vary
low estimate five applications a day are re
ceived for this work. Indeed, the Doaltton is
one that Is considered among laboring me.i aa
well paid and not Involving extra laborious
work.
NO EXPERIENCE NEEDED.
Taking of testimony in the arbitration
proceedings between the Carmen's Union
and the United Railroads is gradually
drawing to a close. Yesterday morning
when the case was resumed, E. J. Liver
nash, counsel for the Carmen's Union,
stated that he had decided not to exam
ine Manager Chapman, Master Mechanic
Bodler or Secretary "Wlllcutt further. Ac
cordingly Attorney Moore, to keep the
proceedings going, filed the statements of
John E. Russell, general foreman of the
road engineer's department of the com
pany, and F. Â£3. Sharon, superintendent
of the cable road machinery.
The statement of Russell follows:
I am the general foreman of the road engi
neer's department of the United Railroads of
San Frnclsco and have had fifteen years' ex
perience In street railroad business. As such
general foreman I have charge of the track
men, laborers and cast-welding machine outfit
employed by the United Railroads. It la a part
of my duty to hire and discharge men in my
employ. The duties of my department are con
fined to all work along the lines of the United
Railroads on the surface. We have in our em
ploy under me one trackman earning $2 75 a
day, two trackmen earning $ 2 60 a day, two
trackmen earning $2 25 a day, one trackman
earning $75 a month, two trackmen earning $65
a month, five laborers earning $t>0 a month,
fourteen pavers earning $2 50 a day and fifty
two laborers earning $2 per day. A day con
sists of ten hours' work. Eight hours of night
work is paid for as a full day, but molt of the
work performed by these men is day work.
Time over ten hours is paid for at straight time
rates.

or combination to raise prices on all carpets. WE POSITIVELY REFUSED TO JOIN THEM.

It is a grand demonstration of our oft told story that "IT PAYS TO TRADE IN THE MISSION."

LITTLE THIMGS COUNT
In launderingâ a little better, more
thorough, washing; a little more or
less starch; a little more or less blu-
ing; a little less haste in ironing 1 â all
go to make the difference between
good and indifferent work. We flatter
ourselves we take a little more pains
than anybody else in all departments.
No saw edges.

The Norwegian bark Bonafide. which ar
rived here Sunday from New Zealand, has
been chartered by Williams. Dlmond & Co.
to carry lumber to the Marquesas Islands and
from there to take pearl shells and copra to
the United Kingdom. While In New Zealand
Captain Olsen had an opportunity to
charter his vessel for the United
Kingdom at 25s, a very much better
rate than he could hone to get from San
Francisco at present, or for a long time to
come. He refused the charter, and under
orders from his owners came here In ballast.
The Bonafide's small size and the fact that
she Is a wooden vessel made her unavailable
for a grain charter. The Bonaflde Is a vessel
of 6S4 tons register and can carry only about
700 tons of freight

TO ARRIVE
New evidence has been obtained by De
tective Tom Gibson regarding the way
matters were managed In the Eppinger
warehouses at Crockett. A person who
was engaged in the warehouses has
stated to Detective Gibson that he, as a
weigher, acting under instructions used
for a long period a small secret weight,
which, when placed on the scales by
which the farmers' grain was weighed,
robbed the farmers of fifteen pounds of
grain in every four bags.
Detective Gibson has obtained posses
sion of the weight that was employed
against the farmers. It was placed on
what is known technically by the weigh
ers as the "P" of the scales, being at
tached to the bottom of the place where
the regular weights are when in position.
Pitch or some other adhesive substance
was used to hold the defrauding weight
in place while the scales were "balanced"
preliminary to the weighing of a lot of
grain. Then it was deftly taken out by
the weigher and concealed in his pocket
to be used again.
This loss to the farmers is in addition
to the two pounds taken from every sack
for "shrinkage." The weight that Gib
son has will be put In evidence before
the Grand Jury, when the prosecuting
banks that took the warehouse receipts
and were defrauded will try to furnish
testimony sufficient to have an indict
ment brought against Bernhard Ettllng
er, the only member of tht: firm of Ep
plnger & Co. who has not been indicted.
No man can give anything and keep itâ
except a promise.

Bicycle Pumps to Supply Birds

HONOLULU, July 21.â Housekeepers in
Honolulu are having anew experience In
their marketing. Ducks raised by Chinese
are an article of every day fart^ at the
dinner table, but care must be exercised
in their -purchase. The Chinese farmers
have a habit of using bicycle pumps to
Inflate .their, ducks, which, when dressed,
present a young and plump appearance.
Puncturing the ducks, - however, has the
same result as pricking a toy balloon.
They become flat, bony and scraggy un
der the application of a sharp knife.

Lands the British Mail at Auckland in Shortest Time
Ever Made Between London and the New Zealand
City and Beats the Best^Previous Run to Sydney
Â¦
THE Oceanic Steamship Company's
Ventura, Captain Hay ward, which
arrived yesterday from Australia,
established on her outward pas
sage a new record for speedy
transportation between here and the An
tipodes. Incidentally she delivered the
British mails at Auckland just twenty
eight days after the date of their leav
ing London, the best time ever made be
tween London and Auckland. Th? mails
left London May 23 and on June 2". they
were being hustled ashore from te-i Ven
tura. The liner's time from here tr#Auck
land was sixteen days twenty-seviSi min
utes, of which she was actually under
way just fifteen days four hours a id for
ty-one minutes. The Ventura's actual
steaming time from San Francl co to
Sydney was eighteen days thirteen
hours and ten minutes, which Is* eleven
hours and forty-five minutes better than
any previous record. i
The Ventura experienced fine weather
throughout the homeward voyage and ar
rived yesterday ;' with many passengers
and a full cargo.
There was a death on the liner almost
at the end of the voyage. Juanita Dreler,
a 9-year-old girl, died, from appendicitis.
Juanita and her sister, a year or two
older, had been attending school .'n this
city. Their home is in Honolulu a:Â«d ihey
left here on the Ventura to spen4l their
vacation at tne Hawaiian capital.! They
caught the liner on her return trip anil,
although Juanita had been compfiitilrig,
nothing serious was feared. Appendicitis
developed, however, and the little?' victim
died on Sunday night. Dr. Clarke, the
liner's surgeon, and Drs. T. "Wholey and
M. W. O'Connell, who were passengers,
did all they could for the little sufferer.
An operation was impossible on Recount
of the extreme weakness of the patient.
Among the Ventura's passengers were
some noted colonials. Miss C. E. Ruwson,
sister of Sir Harry Rawson, Govfrnor of
New South Wales, was a passen/>'T. R.
Entz, general manager in Sydney of the
North German Lloyd Sreamship Com
pany, arrived on the Ventura. D. barker
and P. E. Fabricus, reputed the Richest

The District Attorney of Contra Costa
County was thunderstruck when Post
master Schmidt told him he wanted to
have the alleged conspirators arrested for
purloining the whole town. At first he
wouldn't believe It. He had heard of des
perate deeds done, but none of quite such
gigantic proportions as this. When he
finally recovered his breath he decided to
take the matter under advisement until
he could look up the law touching on such
cases made and provided.
Postmaster Schmidt stopped off at In
ternational, or rather what was Interna
tional, on his way back from Martinez
and after a long search managed to find
just a small portion of the former town.
It was a board eight feet long, one inch
thick and twelve inches wide. This Mr.

OAKLAND, July 27.â A struggle In
courts and on cars has begun for
the possession of the town of In

lage from Contra Costa County,
and several men are trying to capture It.
Postmaster George Schmidt of Berkeley
applied to the District Attorney of Contra

rants for the arrest of Robert B. Mott and
W. I. Sedgley, vice president and man
ager respectively of the defunct Interna
tional Explosives Company, who, he says,

much of International as was piled on
two flatcarsâ and all the village, with the
exception of its original site, was on the
vehicles in the shape of splintered boards,
windows, timbers and knot holes. Inter
national was unloaded from the cars on
which it visited Alameda upon lumber
wagons and taken from there to some
place along the Haywards road, where it
will settle down and stay a while if the
law does not follow behind and cause the
animated village to get another move on.
Not even the oldest inhabitant of In
ternational could point with pride to the
remnants of the roving little burg as it
lay prostrate on the flat cars to-day,
while men and teams labored and per
spired to help the town along to any old
place where it could rest In peace and be
out of the reach of people who might
want to kidnap the village again. Piled
indiscriminately on the cars was the ma
terial that composed the buildings of In
ternational when It resided In Contra
Costa County and which gave to the
place its habitations and a name. As the
workmen pulled the stakes from the cars
some of International spread Itself upon
Alameda. but was soon gathered up and
started on Its journey out of this munici
pality.
Cardinal Gibbons celebrated early mass
In the private chapel of the Sulphlclans
and then drove to the Vatican, where he
participated In the meetlnsr of the Con
gregation of Cardinals. He was most cor
dially received by all his colleagues and
the members of the Sacred College ap
pointed at the last consistory were pre
sented to him. Cardinal Gibbons then
took the oath of the gospels, administered
by Cardinal Oreelia. dean of the Sacred
College, to maintain strict secrecy on all
questions discussed at the meeting of the
congregation and v to defend the rights,
prerogatives and temporal claims of the
church. When the meetins of the con
gregation was over Cardinal Gibbons went
to St. Peter's and prayed before the
blessed sacrament. He then knelt before
the resting place of the Pope and prayed
for about fifteen minutes.

CARDINAL GIBBONS' DAY.
The board of directors which authoriz
ed the removal of the buildings is com
posed of P. E. White, H. C. Stillwell.
Robert Mott, W. I. Sedgley and Freder
ick Dassenville. They say the structures
were worthless as they stood at Interna
tional, the plant having been abandoned.
Therefore the board decided to remove
the buildings and put them up where
they could be made serviceable.
Besides the dismantled buildings, the
company's directors claim it has JSOOO or
$10,000 worth of chemicals on hand, and
has other property which will total $20,
000 In assets.
Schmidt Is mistaken when be says that I am
responsible for the removal of International.
I was never at the place, and don't know
where it was. I am a director In the Interna
tional Explosives Company. The directors o'
that corporation held a meeting and decided
It was to their Interests to have the buildings
removed from the location in Contra Costa
County. Being engaged In the building busi
ness. I was requested to secure a man to su
pervise the moving of the buildings, and I got
W. I. Sedgley to boes the Job. I never went
to International myself. Schmidt may believe
that he had a mortgage on the entire plant at
International, but he had no mortgage on the
buildings. They were erected after he had se
cured the mortgage and under a decision of.
the Supreme Court I think that it will be de
cided, if the matter Is ever tried In court, that
Schmidt has no claim whatever on the build
ings.
Here is what Robert B. Mott, whom
George Schmidt claims had something to
do with giving International the hobo
habit, said to-night about the matter:
Mott and Sedgley state that they acted
on legal advice and on orders of the
stockholders of the town in carrying In
ternational out of Contra Costa County
and that the move was made for the
benefit of the creditors of the Interna
tional Explosives Company, which cor
poration owned and controlled the vil
lage.
MOTT'S EXPLANATION.
attached to the little town, his attach
ment taking the form of a mortgage of
$2000. Schmidt traced International to
Alameda and now he is after Mott for an
explanation. W. I. Sedgley, also of this
city, Is another whom Schmidt asserts
was one of the prime movers In starting
International on a Journey, the end of
which is problematical.

j The chairman, vice chairman and secre
tary were made a committee to nominate
a committee on organization, to reunder
take the work of forming a new party out
of the reform forces of the country. The
names selected are to be reported to the
conference to-morrow.' The rest of the
session was devoted to short speeches
containing suggestions for the resolutions
committee.
DENVER, July 27.â About fifty of the
leaders of the Populist party and other
political movements were present at the
St. James Hotel this afternoon when the
conference of political reform leaders was
called to/ order. The conference was
called to order by J. A. Edgerton, secre
tary of the Populist National Committee,
who called the conference. He spoke
briefly, outlining the work which It was
hoped to accomplish by the conference in
the amalgamation of the various reform
forces of the nation Into one party. Mr.
Edgerton was made the permanent chair
man of the conference, with Milton Park
of Texas as vice chairman and J. H. Cal
derhead of Montana secretary. The after
noon was taken up in the work of organi
zation and short addresses. The principal
speech was made by former United States
Senator W. V. Allen of Nebraska. Sena
tor Allen favored a reorganization of the
reform forces which should embrace the
various factions now embracing practi
cally the same political doctrines and dif
fering mainly In regard to methods.
At the evening session a committee was
named to draft resolutions and an address
to the people and report to the conference
to-morrow afternoon. The committee Is
as follows; Ex-Senator W. V. Allen,
chairman; J. S. Fetter, Illinois; J. M.
Mallet, Texas; Judge Frank W. Owens,
Colorado; Dr. R. H. Rheemlin, Ohio; H.
B. Hewitt, Kansas; W. A. Poynter, Ne

Hooley and W. L. Stow were the domi
nant figures In Des Moires and Fort
Dodge, leased to the Rock Island road la
1887 for eighteen years.
It 13 known that Hooley & Co. had of
fers of help from high quarters, but
deemed it advisable to decline.
The firm of Hooley & Co. was organized
In June, 1902, and consists of Edwin S.
Hooley, Frank E. Brumley and Robert
Helnsheixner. It acquired control of
Evansvllle and Terre Haute two years
ago.
A few of the high-class Industrials
made gains, notably the Westlnghouse Is
sues, 5 points; General Electric. 3; United
States Steel common, 1%, aiid the pre
ferred, lfi.
On the other hand, some other indus
trials finished the day with severe de
clines. Shares of the Rubber Goods Com
pany and the United States Rubber Com
pany, In which the firm of Talbot J. Tay
lor & Co. is said to be interested, sold at
better prices.
The assignee of Hooley & Co. would
make no statement for publication, and
It was impossible to learn the amount of
the liabilities. In conservative circles the
firm's liabilities are placed at about $3,
ooo.ooo.
The Hooley failure was regarded as an
Inevitable sequel to that of W. L. Stow &
Co.. which came last Friday. The failure
of Bassett was wholly unimportantâ one
of the day's incidents.
The market displayed a hesitating tone
at the outset, many of the railroad
stocks showing fractional declines. Slight
improvement soon followed, but prices
fell oft 1 to 3 points In the active list,
with even greater declines In the special
ties, as soon as the Hooley failure came
out. Evansvllle and Terre Haute, a
Hooley specialty, declined 5\fc points and
the entire list reflected considerable con
fusion.
By the end of the fir3t hour the situa
tion seemed well In hand and the prices
advanced, save in a few instances, where
pressure continued to be directed at sev
eral stocks.
The Bassett announcement at noon
caused hardly any excitement. So far as
known Bassett has no outstanding con
tracts in this city. Further Improvement
was shown by the market in the last
hour. Even Evansvllle and Terre Haute
recovered all but one point of its loss,
Des Moines and Fort Dodge and the
Hooley stock gaining four points.
While somewhat Irregular at times, the
list made a number of material net gains.
These include advances of 2 per cent or
more in the active railway list; Brooklyn
Rapid Transit, 2%: Consolidated Gas, 2VÂ«;
Lackawanna, 9; Delaware and Hudson,
4*4; Minneapolis and St. L<ouis common, 3.
and Iowa Central common and preferred,
1 and 2% points, respectively.
NEW YORK, July 27.â In spite of or
probably because of two additional fail
ures on the Stock Exchangeâ E. S. Hooley
& Co. of this city and William Bassett of
Bostonâ to-day's stock market showed
very general improvement, and the situa
tion as a whole was viewed with more
cheerfulness.
W. A." Behrens of the Bella Vista I'.o
tel, San Francisco, told of his having seen
Captain Howard with his papers and of
his efforts to start a company. He saw
him last on July 9 and then he had talked
of going home to his family. To David
S. Edwards of Piedmont, secretary for
Henry Butters, with whom Captain How
ard had dealings, the dead man never
appeared to be despondent and he was al
ways in an optimistic mood, even when
bis reverses seemed greatest.
AUTOPSY SURGEON IN DOUBT.
Dr. C. F. Gladding, the autopsy physi
cian, described the wounds found on the
head of the body. He was guarded in hi3
statements as to the cause of the frac
tured skull. Whether it was the result
of an exterior blow, a fall or a pistol
bullet crushing through the skull, com
bined with the fall, he was not prepared
to say. Either of the wounds, the pistol
wound, or the fractured skull, was suf
ficient to cause death. In illustrating the
position In which the body lay when he
found It. Dr. Gladding showed that the
pistol was hanging to the first finger of
the right hand, which was under the
body, the body being on Its face. The
only new matter brought out was In the
testimony of A. W. Dutton, West Berke
ley station agent for the Southern Pa
cific Company, who said that a man an
swering Captain Howard's description en
tered his office on July 17, between 3 and 4
oclock, and asked when the last train left
for San Francisco. When Informed that
it left at 11:25 o'clock, he went out and
boarded the next train going to San Fran
cisco. This circumstance has a bearing
on the suicide theory, as showing the ir
resolute manner of the man In West
Berkeley.
The other witnesses were Mrs. Annie
E. Wilson, who found the body; G. A.
Carman, who talked with Howard the
day before his death, and George Etlck
son, whose testimony amounted to noth

J. B. Treanor told how he had met Cap
tain Howard on July 11 in San Francisco,
when Howard told him he had purchased
his ticket and intended leaving that night
for Victoria, whence he intended I? visit
bis mining lands near Dawson.
The testimony of Mr. Treanor and the
letter received by Mrs. Howard show that
Captain Howard fully intended to go to
Victoria about July 11. At that time he
was in good spirits, even though his plans
to float a company did not materialize,
and the idea of suicide never seems to
have been in his mind.
SEEMED IN GOOD SPIRITS
"I believe she got a letter from him
dated July 12. saying he was coming
home. That was the last she heard of
him."
The testimony introduced before the
Coroner's jury did not throw any new
light on the cause of the death of Cap
tain Howard and was very like that
whirh has already been published ex
tensively in the newspapers. R. W. Tur
ner testified that he knew little of Cap
tain Howard's business affairs. He knew
of his efforts to float a company to work
the mining lands in Canada, but nothing
of the details. He never knew of Captain
Howard having carried a pistol or
threatening suicide or being melancholy
over his reverses.
"Did he ever tell you his life was in
danger?'-' the witness was asked.
"Never," was the reply.
"Do you think he was embarrassed suf
ficiently in a financial way to have caused
him to become despondent and take his
life?"
"No."
"Do you know when his wife last heard
from him?"
The effects of Captain Howard are be
ing held by Newman for an unpaid bill
that the unfortunate man owed at the
time of his death. Newman permitted R.
W. Turner, who came from Victoria to
identify the body, and J. B. Tre^nor, Cap
tain Howard's friend, to see tho papers
to-day, but he would not let them go
out of his possession. Deputy Coroner
Streightif told the Coroner that he had
called to summon Newman, but that gen
tleman was not in and ne left the Sum
mons, which Newman did not answer, as
it had not been legally served.
NEWMAN HOLDS PAPERS.
The Coroner's jury summoned to hold
an inquest into the cause of death of Cap
tain Thomas Howard of Victoria, whose
body was found at the Brennan barn, did
not reach a verdict to-night because
Charles Newman, proprietor of the Russ
House in San Francisco, failed to answer
the Coroner's summons. The members of
the Jury decided that the introduction of
the papers and documents among Captain
Howard's effects at the Kuss House were
indispensable to a proper verdict in the
case, and requested Coroner Mehrmann
to continue the Inquest until another
time. In accordance with the wishes of
the jury, therefore. Coroner Mehrmann
continued the hearing until Wednesday
night of this week.
The testimony of a number of witnesses
went to show that Captain Howard was
in the habit of carrying a large number
of papers with him, particularly a copy of
the concession to him of mining land
from the Canadian Government and maps
of the properties. Not a scrap of paper
was found in the pockets of his clothing
alter his death, and as these papers have
an important bearing on the manner and
cause ot his death they are necessary to
the Coroner's jury in arriving at a ver
dict. The papers among Captain How
ard's effects at the Russ House are the
originals of the copies he carried in his
rockets, and through them the inquisitors
hope to find some motive for his having
been killed by interested personsâ that is,
if he was killed. ,

Dr. Miles' Nervine Has
Cured Me.
Â« âââââ _-v â¢ ,.
There is nothing so rood in cases of
* chronic headache as Dr. Miles* Nervine. It
restores the disordered nerves to their nor-
mal condition and banishes headache forever.
"My trouble was headache, chronic so as
to be almost continual. I had been in this
condition ever since I could remember and
I an now fortv-seven years old. My father
was a preat sufferer from the same complaint
and mv son has shown signs of similar affec-
tion. When the attacks would appear, my
stomach would often become affected and I
would grow dizzy and faint and often had
to quit my work and lie down. I am a sta-
tionary engineer aad found it hard to hold a
place with such a heavy handicap. About
six years *?o I began taking Dr. Miles* Re-
storative Nervine and since that time I have
used m all, fourteen bottles. The number of
bottles taken was not really required as I
think the cure was completely effected after
taking the second bottle. Having scarcely
seen the time in thirty years I was free from
headache, I could not believe the perma-
nent cure to be made to soon, so I continued
it* use until 1 was thoroughly convinced. Sjx
persons to whom I have recommended the
remedy have experienced equally gratifying
results, the only difference between their
case and mine lying in the severity of the
trouble cured-"â Edgar W. Wilson, Alcott,

Braunhart answered that such a course
is Impossible, because the declaratory or
dinance, including all the propositions,
had been already adopted and that they
were all necessary. Wilson's motion that
the call for the election be amended so as
to include only schools, hospital and sew
ers received no second.
Wilson said It was a surprise to the
public that the proposed improvements,
which it had been calculated would cost
$]3,000,000, had been increased to $18,135,000.
"It seems to me," said "Wilson, "that
this Increase will prove disastrous to the
bond issue, and I would suggest that the
propositions be submitted at two elec
tions."

The cost estimates of the City Engineer
were adopted and the twelve propositions
will.be voted upon separately. In the
event of their adoption by a two-thirds
vote forty-year . serial bonds bearing in
terest at 314 per cent per annum will be
issued.
The Board of Supervisors passed to
print yesterday an ordinance calling a
special election on September 29, 1903, for
the purpose of submitting to the electors
the question of issuing bonds for the fol
lowing estimated cost of public improve
ments:
Byington was compelled to take Imme
diate action, as the three years within
which information must be lodged
against a person who commits a crime
will expire to-day. Some lawyers are of
the opinion that the law does not apply
to city officials who misappropriate funds,
but Byington wants to make Sure of his
ground.
Acting Chief of Police Martin notified
Mayor Schmitz that he had Northrup lo
cated, so the warrant will probably oe
served at once and Nortnrup be brought
to trial. Expert Young: says that he is
almost certain that there are many who
are implicated in the peculations in the
County Clerk's office, but is not prepared
to say at the present'time upon whom his
suspicions rest.
Some unfavorable comment is heard be
cause Mayor Schmitz waited almost until
the last minute to file information with
the Grand Jury about Northrup's al
leged defalcation. The Mayor received the
first report definitely connecting North
rup with the stealing of fees on June 30
last and another report of further pecu
lations was filed witn him on July 14.
It iÂ« asserted that the Mayor v should
have filpd the information kt least two
weeks ago and not at a time when the
Grand Jury was on the eve of going out
of office. The delay t of the Mayor will, It
Is expected, be corrected by the issuance
of warrants for the arrest of Northrup
on the last day of the three years in
which the statute of limitations is sup
posed to run.
District Attorney Byington yesterday
made an examination of the records of
the County Clerk's office now being ex
perted by the experts of the Supervisors*
Finance Committee and as a result he at
once arranged to have warrants issued
for the arrest of Vernon F. Northrup on
charges of embezzlement of moneys be
longing to the city and county while em
ployed as* a deputy County Clerk under
William A. Deane and Charles F. Curry.
The specific items upon which Byington
will secure the arrest of Northrup will be
that he received the sum of $24 50 from
Attorney John O'Gara as fees in an estate
and $19 85 from Attorney R. H. Cross for
probate fees and never turned the cash
over to the citv treasury.
The evidence secured by Byington In
cludes the receipts for the two amounts
signed by Northrup and the fact that no
entry of the- receipt of the money was
ever made in the cash book.

quisition of the Geary-

Chicago advanced Hie. but foil hack slight
ly. The American visible supply decreased
117.000 bushels. There was good outside buy-
Ing of both Wheat and Corn, with increasing
signs of a large public Interest In grain. â¢
This market was flrm. with higher futures.
There Is sharp competition for supplies be
tween two-flrnn In the vicinity of Stockton,
which Is running prices up In that region. As
high as $1, 574 Is reported paid there for fine
milling. . .
The Chicago letter of Bolton. De Ruytcr &
Co. says; "Market was again strong and
higher. Liverpool was up Â¦\fii}id. partly on
smaller world's shipments than had been ex
pected. Primary receipts about half of lÂ«st
year, and th<? visible supply shown a small de
crease, against an Increase of over 1.000,000
last year. Snow, in his crop report, falls lntft
line with the general commercial estimate by
saying that threshing returns show a large
falling off -from expectations. Yield of winter
wheat no larger than last year. He also says
that spring wheat Is no more than holding Its
own and that rainfall Is badly distributed. Our
own reports continue to bÂ« in the nature of
complaints, both on the threshing returns In
Nebraska and the appearance of the develop
ing crop in tho Northwest. Cash demand Is
still moderate, but with practically no stocks
of wheat selling pressure. Is slight. We -still
advise buying wheat on the breaks."

The fruit market was somewhat dull as far
as the local trade was concerned, and the In
quiry for shipping stock was light, only email
parcels of good sound stock being wanted for
that purpose. Prices of Plum.', Prunes, Fijrs
and Apricots In small boxes and crates had
but slight variation, receipts belntt. light. Fan
cy well-colored Gravensteln Apples ln,4-\tler

were estimated at about 10,000 boxes, over
half of which were teci rd.s. Peaches were
weak at lower prices, bi ill In baskets and

was paid only for gllt-eilccd stock, $25 being
an extreme figure for the teneral run of sup
plies. Nectarines and Grapes were offering
trcely, but only very choice, stock attracted
any attention. Seedless Sultana Graces ap
peared from Hanford and sold at $2 per crate.

1 Later In the 'lay. when It was said no further !
I failure would be announced, the tone of the '
market became veiy strong and the early
lessee were wlrwd out, even in the '.vÂ«ak stock;, \
whiie the ceneral levi of the market rote to
a substantial level over last night. The de
mand was csr^laUy conspicuous fcr New York
Central, St. Paul. Southern Pacific, Reading-,
I Illinois Central and stocks of a like substantial .
I grade. Some large orders were executed In 1
I a!I of these stocks and at other points through- !
nut the list, torn* prices ending tte <Jay from ;
I 1 to over S above Saturday's level for prom-.
i lncnt stock?, and at much wider advances for i
! the le&* active securities. Some of this buying !
| wag* to cover short contracts and & considerable 1
] portion of it was by professional operators for
I a turn In the market on the lone ride. But I
i th'-re wa* an Improved demand for Investment, â¢
j both In stocks and bonds, and Stock Exchange
commission houses showed an Increased con- i
' fi.l'iice In advising their customers to buy. ,
j Only a few of the Inactive stocks showed such I
. violent falls as have characterized the recent ]
j market, which pointed to a conclusion that i
i there wan lets pressure to close out unmarket- j
I able securities figuring as collateral In lots
j and Improvement In facilities for recurlnr ae- I
eommodatlon. The recent contraction of credit |
I in the stock market has been largely du<Â» to i
I distrust of such operations as those In which i
; the recently failed firm* have b-sen largely :
i engaged. Involving as' they did Inflation and j
j manipulation of the. values of securities. The ;
| letting out of this Inflation has really brought :
j a sense of relief from the oppression of artl
â¢ final conditions henglns over the market and
sustained with difficulty. These held-over pro
jects wfrÂ» quite apart from the earlier ones In
which the syndicates were successful in hold
ing up prices until their holdings wpre taken
off thtlr hands and which have left behind
them also their train of financial rlistress and
disappointments. But with the passlns of the
syndicates' interest in these and the abandon- '
' ment or the artificial support the stocks have ;
| been allowed to !>ink to the level natural to !
â¢(.the changes In their status. The recent fall- j
j ures represent the abandonment of efforts to j
sustain by main strength the prices ot securl- ]
tlÂ»s. the market for which has passed and the <

HONOLULU, July 21.â Captain Barton
of the steamship Clavering. which went
ashore off this port July 19 and was sub
sequently pulled off the reef, claims that
the bell on the buoy at the entrance to
the channel was not ringing on the night
that he struck the reef, and that his
soundings showed twenty fathoms just
before he touched. It is a fact that Jap
anese fishermen often stop the bell from
ringing on the buoy so as not to interfere
with their sleep. As the nlghrwas very
calm and smooth when the Clavering
went ashore there may not have been
swell enoush to ring the buoy bell, even
if its clapper were not tied by the Japs.
Says Bell Did Not Ring

ON TACOMA BESTAUBANTS
If the coust authorizes the water company
to collect this money on the basis of last year's
rates Is It not practically first giving Judg
ment to the water company tnd afterward pro
ceeding to try the case?
Is the water company In contempt of court
If It unes the Injunction unfairly or dishonestly
or make* any misrepresentation of it?
Will this Injunction In any manner prevent
the city from acquiring the municipal water
system which thts beard has already taken
steps toward securing from a source In the
Sierras?
What is done with the money collected by
the water company In excess of the rate fixed
by this board?
Does the water company have the usÂ« an 1
benefit of It, or is It deposited in the United
States treasury, so that each consumer may
recover It without expense?
If each consumer (whose average claim will
probably average $1 50) has to finally sue for
this money can he also sue for his attorney s
fees and lots of time and expenses Incidental
to such a sutt?
Has the water company the authority under
the law to shut oft the water of any consumer?
If so, under what procedure?
Can you obtain an Injunction from any court
prohibiting the water company from enforcing
the collection of any water rate from the con
sumers of this city until the matter Involved
in this injunction is decided?
Can you obtain an injunction against the wa
ter company prohibiting It from shutting off
the water from any or all consumers In this
city? #
SUGGESTS INJUNCTION.
When a consumer pays this demand under
protest must the water company give him a re
ceipt which acknowledges this protest?
Can the water company threaten to or shut off
the water of any consumer who refuses to pay
any water rate until this case Is decided, or
who refuses to pay the sum demanded of bun
by the water company?
Has It the right to state on the receipt that
the money Is received on account of any rate
that may be fixed?
The board adopted a resolution provid
ing that in the matter of the order re
straining the Board of Supervisors from
enforcing the water rates for the present
year, issued out of the United States
Court, the City Attorney be requested
to answer the following questions:
What Is the scope of this Injunction?
Is any water rate now in force In this city?
What has been the procedure In the col
lection of water rates from consumers In for
mer cases of this kind In this city?
Does this Injunction permit the water com
pany to demand a rate in excess of that fixed
by this board?
Does the injunction affect each and every
water consumer, without service of any copy
of the same on them, or without their having
any knowledge of what It enjoins?
Must water consumers accept the statement
by word of mouth of The employes of the wa
ter company as to this injunction?
Has the water company the right under this
Injunction to demand from the consumers any
amount In excess of the rate fixed by this
board?

was official as it was signed by the Board
of Works, and D'Ancona replied that if
Manson's name was mentioned It was be
cause he had made the water question a
sort of a "bugaboo."
Braunhart said the resolution was pre
sented. owing to the fact that the Board
of Works, through Commissioner Manson.
had written a communication to the board
suggesting that the municipal water sup
ply proposition should first be submitted
before any other public improvements are
voted upon. Braunhart said that the sug
gestion was impertinent and uncalled for.
"Manson's criticism," said D'Ancona,
"has demonstrated his absolute lncompe
tency as a man of affairs or else that he
is striving to put obstacles in the way of
the people acting on other public Improve
ments."
Resolved. That the Board of Supervisors
hereby declares that it is necessary and desir
able that the people) of San Francis;.) be given
an opportunity of expressing themselves upon,
the proposition of Incurring a bonded indebt
edness for the securing- of a municipal water
works, and that it ia the Intention of this board
to submit the question of the acquisition of
such works to the electors at the earliest pos
sible moment upon favorable action by the
Secretary of the Interior upon the city's appli
cation for reservoir sites at LaVco Elinor and
Hetchy Hctchy Valley, and that In case these
applications be rejected this board declares Its
intention' to at once take such other steps as
may seem advisable to secure a municipally
owned water system.
The Board of Supervisors adopted a res
olution yesterday declaring its intention
to submit to the people the proposition to
acquire a municipal water supply from
the Tuolumne River at the earliest possi
ble opportunity. Supervisors d'Ancona
and Braunhart took occasion to score the
Board of Works for criticizing the first
named board's course in the matter of
bor^d issues. The resolution says:
Supervisors Score the Board
of Works for Making
Suggestions.

POOR old New York! Poor old 400!
What with Mr. Fitch's "climb
ers" of Gotham, the "frisky" Mrs.
Johnson and company, the Cen
tral's wonderful menagerie of
metropolltes, and now Mrs. Halnes" peo
ple in "Hearts Aflame." presented for the
first time here last evening at the Cali
fornia by the Neill-Moroscos, one is by
way of being grateful for the moral al
titudes of San Francisco. The "bong
tong" in fact begins to be tiresome. It
does precisely the same thing in precisely
the same way through play after play.
In Mrs. Haines' play it disports itself af
ter the manner of Mr. Fitchâ almost as
Ingeniously In the first and second actsâ
and there Is a general "done before" feel
ing about the thing. One finds in It the
same light regard for the sanctltites of
life, the same gayly Irreverent/outlook.-
Marriage is a jest, friendship a fraud and
envy, boredom and vulgarity color the
whole atmosphere. Poor old 400!
Mechanically Mrs. Haines has managed
to put her story quite attractively In the
first two acts. The dialogue goes not
badly and the plot unfolds clearly and
logically. With more style and speed in
performance the play would go not un-.
Mr. Oberle has the ungrateful role of
Mrs. Harmony's ". erring husband and
brings to it considerable discretion and
capacity. George Soule Spencer is a con
scientious Paul Charterls, rather naive in'
his assumption of the man of the world
role, but pleasing. One^of, the best bits
of. the performance : is Miss Elsie Es
mond's Alison Deyo and Miss Hartstone's
dainty Mrs. Alec Dunbar, and the Helena
Lloyd of' Miss Oberle were both clever.
The rest all filled in, .acceptably, and
Sincerity and conscientiousness rather
than style and smartness were the char
acteristics of the performance. The
Nelll-Moroseos bring- a "good deal ' of
oddly earnest effort to their work and
the play owes not a little to- them. Miss
Lillian Kemble, who. as Mrs. Harmony,
has "the leading role. Is commendably
sincere in her methods. ' Style she has
none. Her bearing . is awkward, her
gowns ungraceful, her diction faulty, yet
there is a vitality, earnestness about Miss
Kemble's work that goes a long way to
please. She has temperament' and force
that need pruning and direction, and
meantime there \ is abundant promise or
better things. Â¦ , â¢ '
pleasingly so far. The third act,, with its
crowded and Incongruous incident and
general "talkiners," falls down consider
ably. But, as a whole, the play seemed
to please the' audience, .which was a large
and friendly one.

Trouble Among Female Strikers.
There is a strike on at Ames & Harms'
bag factory at Sacramento and Drumm
streets. Two of the girl strikers, each 18
years of age, were arrested yesterday by
Policeman Ingham on a warrant issued
by Police Judge Conlan charging them
with battery.. The complaining witness
is Agnes Snepper, who has taken the
place of one of the strikers. She alleges
that the two defendants beat her and
scratched her face yesterday morning.
They were each released on $10 cash
bail.
In "The Manxman," that brinlly pa
thetic dramatization of Hall Calne's
story. White Whittlesey finds a role that
fits him, and the audience finds a Whit
tlesey without the mannerisms that have
always given the critics more pain to
mention than it gave the actor to read.
As the loving, unsuspicious husband of a
woman who spends her time in see-saw
ing from her husband to her lover and
from her lover back again to her hus
band, he was all that could be desired
from an artistic view point, and the aud
ienceâan extra large oneâ testified its
surprise and delight by calling the princi
pals before the curtain at the close of
each act. Miss Bertha Creighton more
than made good on her previous good rec
ord as a convincing actress and played
the somewhat inconsistent role with a
fidelity to the author's conception that
brought forth that highest tribute to act
ingâthe handkerchief and the tear. , The
support was excellent. Oza Waldrop, the
Nancy of the cast, played in her usually
excellent vein without any striving after
the comic effort, the resistance of which
temptation speaks Trell for her apprecia
tion of the fitting. The villain of the
piece â a unique, remorseful villain by the
way â was In the capable â¢ hands of
Charles Wyngate, the Philip Christian,
who keeps on sinning and sniveling his
grief because of it at the same time. The
woman in the case and he, when they
come together, seem to convert them
selves into pathetic sprinkling machines.
The erring woman's father, Caesar Cre
gan, a hypocrite, was ably portrayed by
George Osbourne, who is infinite in his
variety.

as Marlon, the daughter of Rizardo. fur

artistic excellence. Edwin Emery played
well the congenial part of the young

ster contributed a good bit of a character
sketch In Farmer Mason. Miss Myrtle
Vane, In the soubrette role of Bessie, was
charming, and Millar Bacon made the
most of the> fine comedy part of the young
barrister. George NIcholls had the un
grateful part of a villainous French colo
nel, and Little Ollie Cooper was pleasing
in a small boy character. The comedy of

whole performance possesses sterling
merit. . \
The Judge sentenced Newman to p-iy a
fine of 510 on the charge of disturbing the
peace and said he would postpone sen
tence on the charge of battery upon Ar
thur Chambers, a clerk at the consulate,
for thirty days, warning Newman that if
he created any disturbance again at the
consulate he would be very *t-vercly pun
ished. Newman's attorney promised
that he would not again visit the consu
late.
The Judge said he very much regretted
that counsel should have chosen to ask
New man such questions, because," no mat
ter how conscious the Consul or his
friends might be of his innocence, it
placed him in a very embarrassing posi
tion to have such charges made by u man
even of the caliber of the defendant.
Vice Consul Moore then testified to
Newman having used most vulgar and
profane language at the consulate last
Wednesday in the presence of ladles and
others.
I never saw that man in my life' before. I
never Invited him to come to my ofUce on
oincial or private business nor did I ever see
him at his home. I did not know that such
* creature existed. I never had any conversa
tions witl'. him a* to shipping fees for sailors.
1 never authorized any one to solicit money
irom him tor such a purpose. If it came to
my knowledge that any clerk in my office did
Hich a thing his position would be vacated
within an hour, and so ll would be with myself.
Attorney Bert Schlesinger, who repre
sented the British Consul, asked that Air.
Bennett be allowed to refute the state
ments made by Newman. Mr. Bennett, in
answer to questions, said when Newman
was pointed out to him:
The case of disturbing the peace against
Newman on the complaint of Wellesley
Moore, the British Vice Consul, came up
for trial and when It was called Attorney
Archie Campbell, on behalf of the defend
ant, said that the defendant was willing
to admit he might have been boisterous
and Indiscreet and would plead guilty.
Courtenay W. Bennett, the British Con
sul, had an opportunity of denying under
oath in Police Judge Cabanlss' court yes
terday the statements made under oath
by T. J. Newman, proprietor of a sailors'
boarding-house at 76 Jackson street, last
Thursday that the British Consul had
called at his boarding-house on more than
one occasion and had suggested that bm
his salary was not sufficient to keep up
his social position Newman should pay
him $5 on each sailor shipped from his
boarding-house so as to gtt the protection
of the consulate.

,The Central Theater achieved another
extraordinary success last night In the
production of the powerful romantic
drama, "A Lion's Heart," which, from
prologue to the closing scene, enthused
and delighted a house that was packed to
the doors. Thunders of applause reward
ed - Henscrhel Mayall and his fellow play
ers for their splendid work, and there
were repeated curtain calls. The pro
logue of "A Lion's Heart" is a novelty in
stage scene, picturing life behind the
curtain, in the green room of a French
circus. The performers are attired for
the ring, and amid the trappings of tin

From Pimples to Scrofula,
From Infancy to Age.
The agonizing itching and burning
of the skin, as in eczema; the frightful
scaling, as In psoriasis ; the loss of hair
. and cresting of the scalp, as in scalled
bead ; the facial disfigurement, as in
pimples and ringworm ; the awful suf-

and salt rheum, â all demand a remedy
of almost superhuman virtues to suc-
cessfully cope with them. That Cuti-

the absolute safety and great economy
have made them the standard skin enres
and humour remedies of the civilized
world.
