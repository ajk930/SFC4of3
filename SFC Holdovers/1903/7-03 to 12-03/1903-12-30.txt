WASHINGTON, Dec. 29.â Preparation of the answer of this Government
to the communication from General Reyes, the CÂ«lombian envoy, is pro
gressing, but it is said that it will not be ready for presentation before
Thursday. The death of Mr. Thomas, the translater in the State Depart
ment, has caused some delay in the work. .
.No intimation can be obtained officially as to the character of this Gov
ernment's reply, but it Is said the continuance , of negotiations with Gen
eral Reyes for some little time is quite likely. His frequent conferences with
the officials of the administration have enabled General Reyes to realize
that the United States will not retrace a step on the isthmus. Whether
Colombia may, hope for relief from Congress, in the shape of an indemnity
for the loss she has suffered In the secession of Panama, is a matter/which
can be left open for the present, it Ms said, as Colombia and the United
States are concerned now with the broader question as to the inter
pretation of the treaty of 1846. " ," i y x \Â± Â¦
. Returning a visit of Secretary Root, made several days ago, General
Reyes called at the War Department this afternoon and vas with the Sec
retary for a half hour. General Reyes took occasion to reiterate the great
pressure he was bringing to bear oh his to remain quiet until his
mission was finished. The Secretary fully appreciates the delicate posi
tion of General Reyes, and it'is possible will be able to. give him some*sug
gestions as to how the Colombians may be made-aware of the real situation
here. Â¦....'.Â¦â¢Â¦
General .Reyes deprecates the publications which. have appeared, pur
porting, to give the substance of his note to this. Government. He "pro
nounces them to be incorrect. He does not want, to discuss the matter at
this time, but deems | it expedient to make, the statement that Colombia,
in her initial note, hasdwelt upon the several clauses of the treaty of 1846
which, . in her opinion, the United States has violated. As to what if any
redress the United States will offer, that is regarded as a matter for discus
sion in future notes. -â¢â¢ â¢'
General Reyes has asked to be excused from attending the New Year's
United States' Reply to Reyes Will
Give Colombia No Hope.

MOSCOW. Dec. 29. â The Govern
ment is considering a plan for making
the sale of. tea and sugar a state
monopoly, as proposed by M. Wltte
while Finance Minister. There is much,
opposition to the proposal on the part
of the tea trade and the grocers, but
the growing needs- of the treasury and
the exhaustion of other resources, as
pointed out in Witte's last budget, are
believed in well-informed circles to
make the adoption of the proposition
probable.
The present brandy monopoly yields
about a fourth of .the revenues of the
empire and the monopoly of tea and
sugar is expected to be even more
profitable, as the expense of its opera
tion will be small.

BERLIN, Doc. 23.â Mark Palzer. an
American, has been arrested at Vienna,
accused of having forged a letter of
credit for 510,000 on the Darmstadt
Bank of Commerce and Industry,
which he cashed in Paris. Palzer car
ried considerable foreign money and
newly purchased securities amounting
to ISOOO.
The Darmstadt Bank representative
announced on the Boerse to-day that
its loEs-es through the Palzer forgery
will amount to only $2000.
Palzer also forged a letter of credit
for $2000 on the Nice branch of the
Credit Lyonnais. which letter apparent

Palzer recently secured a position in
the Darmstadt Bank here, but as he
proved unsatisfactory he was given
notice that he would be dismissed.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Dec. 29.â Owing
to a further settling In the track in
two places the Ogden-Lucin cut-off of
the Southern Pacific across the great
Salt Lake will not be opened to regular
traffic on New Years day, as had been
planned. It was announced that the
new work was practically, completed on
Thanksgiving day, when President E.
II: Harriman and a large party of in
vited guests, including ' many promi
nent railroad men, inspected the cut
off.
"Trains will be running regularly
over the cut-off on January 1," declared
Harriman on that day. He was rely
ing upon the assurance of Chief En
gineer William Hood that the quag
mires had been conquered.
The hope has proved false, however.
In two different places the roadbed has
sunk heavily since then, until the en
gineers do not dare permit the regular
running of trains over the track.
The trouble is worst between camps
28 and CO. A large force of men and
two piledrivers are hard at work there
trying to brace up the weak spots. The
trestle is apparently solid, but the
weight of the ballast in the solid road
bed is pressing the soft mud out on
both sides and allowing the track to
settle in the same manner, although
not quite so seriously, as when an en
gine and several cars were thrown Jnto
the lake a few months ago and a num

SACRAMENTO, Dec. 23. â City
Plumbing Inspector Robert E. Chap
man declares he will cause the arrest
of Governor Pardec'9 plumber, Fred
Pierce of Oakland, unless the latter
does over again certain work at the
Governor's mansion so as to make it
comply with the local plumbing ordi
nances.
The State recently purchased the
StefTens house c-n II street for a Gov
ernor's mansion and it was renovated
at considerable expense to accommo
date the Governor's household. Recently
the Governor detected what h*> sup
nf^if'-Kas sewer gas, and sent for
Thomas Scoti^S^vC^'iTtCTrhfT.^ Scott
declared that there was no sewer V<*Â»~"
in the house, but that tt was infested
by bats.
The announcement naturally shocked
the inmates, and their nerves were not
quieted when City Plumbing Inspector
Chapman, who \va3 next called in,
agreed with Soott that bats had ta*ken
possession of the executive mansion.
The Governor was not convinced, but
sent for Fred Pierce, an Oakland
plumber. Pierce at once discovered thÂ»
cause of the trouble Tn an open sewer
under the mansion and proceeded to
correct it. Now Chapman asserts that
Pierce did not comply with the local
plumbing ordinance in the matter and
threatens his arrest unless he comes
back and dors the work over again un
der his supervision.
Governor Pardee is indignant over
the episode, and it is said the Board
of Health will at its next meeting dis
cuss the propriety of retaining an in
spector who could not tell the difference
between sewer gas and bats.

his bill of $9 he tendered the pro

John T. Scully cashed a draft for
$129, purporting to have been signed by
the Great Western Improvement Com
pany, at the Hotel . Netherland on

been repudiated by the company on the
ground that the signature is a forgery.
Scully, who is well known in San
Francisco and adjacent towns, has dis
appeared and the police have been do
ing their best to locate him.
For many years Scully was in the
employ of the Harvey eating houses,
which are located at different points
on the Santa Fe Railroad, and was es
pecially well known at Barstow, Ba
kersfleld and Fresno. Some time since
he resigned his position with the Har
vey Company and went to work for the
Great Western Improvement Company.
He claimed he was v a solicitor for that
concern. He also claimed that Chief
of Police Wittman, one of the directors
of the company, -was a great personal
friend of his. During his sojourns in
the city he was a transient guest at

there when he was in town.

Schmid were greatly surprised to learn
from the Great "Western Improvement
Company that the draft was a for
gery. Payment was refused.
â¢The case was immediately placed in
the hands of detectives, but as Scully
had three days* start, he is undoubted
ly far beyond the reach of the officers
of this State.
Scully has always borne a good repu
tation, but latterly, it is reported, he
has been playing the races and trying
to borrow small sums from his casual
friends. His departure was so hur
ried that he did not even take time to
pack up his dress suit case, which he
left behind him, together with all his
other personal effects.

The newly elected Democratic mem
bers of the Board of Supervisors have
issued a call for. a caucus to be held
this evening in the committee; room of
the board for \he purpose of rearrang
ing the membership of the various com
mittees into which the Board of Su
pervisors biennially resolves itself.
The personnel of some of the com
mittees will be radically changed, no
tably theÂ«Fire Committee, from which
Supervisors Loughery, Wilson and
Lynch will retire, having failed of re
election.
Brandenstein will retain the chair
manship of the Finance Committee and
it is on the cards to select Payot Or
Rock to succeed Loughery, who will
retire therefrom. Who the third mem
ber of the committee to succeed Wilson
will be has not yet been decided, but
it may go to W. W. Sanderson, Repub
lican.
Supervisor Braunhart will remain as
chairman of the Public Utilities Com
mittee, on which he has done good
work and three Supervisors will be
selected to succeed Loughery, Walsh
and Curtis. Their successors may be
Supervisor-elect Finn, Union Labor;
Lunstedt, Republican; Oscar Hocks,
Democrat, or Supervisor Rea, Union
Labor and Republican.
VARIOUS CHANGES.
In all likelihood Supervisor-elect
Rock will succeed Curtis as chairman
of the Street Committee, although Su
pervisor Connor lias his eye on the
place. Connor, however, 's now chair
man of the Water Committee and it is
not likely that he will be given two
such important chairmanships. Braun
hart will remain as the third member
of the Street Committee. ;. 'â¢
Supervisor Boxton said yesterday
that' he would not attend the caucus,
but would be satisfied to retain the
chairmanship of the Police Committee.
The other members -will pe Eggers and
possibly Hocks, to succeed. Curtis, who
will become Sheriff on January 8, next.
PIIELAN'S HAND APPEARS.
Supervisor-elect Finn may succeed
Lynch on the committees on Charities
and Correction and Fire. The two other
members of the Fire Committee will
probably be Sanderson "and Hocks. For
the vacancy on the Printing and Sal
aries Committee created by the retire
ment of Lynch the .names of Finn and
Lunstedt are prominently mentioned.
It is common talk around the City
Hall that ex-Mayor Phelan will be a
large factor in the selection of the
membership of the committees and that
"the names of those to be selected have
already been submitted to his scrutiniz
ing "eye.
It is understood that no changes will
be made- in the clerical- force, of the
board.* Charles W. Fay. will' remain as
clerk, John Behan as chief assistant
clerk and John Ryan, John Finn, F. H.
McKenna, James Donahue, James
Lynch and Thomas 'McGinnif, all of
whom- have demonstrated their effi
ciency, as "assistant clerks. The only
chance "will be the retirement of J: S.
Bannerman, . who will be succeeded as
assistant clerk by Supervisor Lough
ery;YCaptain Anderson expects to be
retained as sergeant at arms.'

adopt with respect to acceptance of

ticipation in the meeting to be held
to-morrow. As the proprietor of 50,
000 shares, Colombia has been repre
sented each year at the annual meet
ings by M. Semper, who was author
ized to act in* its behalf.. This year,
owing: to the recent events at the Isth
mus, the administrative council of the
company declined to admit Semper to
the meeting, on the ground that the
Colombian bonds had become justly
subject to litigation.
Colombia declined to bow to this
decision, and through Senor Urib, the
Consul General, appealed to the
courts for an order upon the company
to issue a card of admission to
M. Semper. Attorneys for Colombia
appeared before M. Ditte, president of
the Cltamber of First Instance. At

NEW YORK, Dec. 29.â Owing to the

a corps of physicians has been appoint

make an investigation of the causes
of the epidemic and their report will
be in the hands of Health Commis
sioner Lederlee in a few days.
During the past week 272 fatal pneu
monia cases were recorded. That is
the largest number of deaths from the
disease in the history of the city. The
previous week 269 deaths occurred, and
It was then thought that conditions
would improve.
When .the disease first became prev
alent, early in November, the deaths
were largely confined to the localities
inhabited by working people, but with
in the last two weeks there have been
as many deaths, proportionately among
the wealthier classes. Many physicians
regard this as another evidence that
pneumonia is an infectious disease.- It
is the general belief in the Health De
partment that the epidemic is due to
the' recent sudden changes in the
weather. C .*Â¦ '

WASHINGTON, Dec. 29.â The State
Department for some time past has
been receiving inquiries from people
of moderate circumstances, and some
almost in poverty, as to the operation?
of some one'- known as George W.
Thatcher, who has addressed notes .to
various persons, representing himself
to be administrator of vast estates in
England in which those addressed were
Informed they had an interest.
Some at least of those .written to paid
fees to. Thatcher and, receiving no in

The department referred some of
these inquiries to the United States
embassy at London, and acting Secre

from that office to the effect that
Thatcher had been prosecuted for fraud
and forgery before the Chancery Court
in London in 1899, had pleaded guilty
and had been sentenced to eighteen
months' imprisonment.

SEATTLE. Wash., Dec. 29.â Because
of his relations with and treatment of
Mrs. Fannie Fohs, a court-martial of
Oscar C. Haines, second lieutenant of
the United States revenue cutter Man
ning, was commenced to-day behind
closed doors in the* Federal Court build
ing. The board is composed of Cap
tain W. H. Roberts, president; Chief
Engineer H. C. Whitworth, First Lieu
tenant F. S. Van Buskerck. Second
Lieutenant James F. Hottel. recorder.
Second Lieutenant H. G. Hamlet of
the revenue cutter Arcata is prosecut
ing for the Government, while G.
Meade Emory and Lieutenant C. W.
Satterlee of the revenue cutter Grant
are counsel for Lieutenant Haines.
The strictest secrecy regarding the
proceedings of tÂ£e trial la being
maintained. The members of the
court and counsel decline to divulge
anything as to the nature of the evi
dence. Several witnesses were exam
ined to-day. Their testimony. It is
said, bore chiefly upon the relations
of Lieutenant Haines and Mrs. Fohs
and his treatment of her in its rela
tion to him as an officer of the revenue
cutter service.
It is understood that witnesses have
been summoned who will be aWe to j
give the court in detail the conduct of
Lieutenant Haines on the occasion of
the visit of Mrs. Fohs to Port Town
send, during which she appealed to J
the lieutenant to keep his promise, as
she alleges, to marry her, and, failing:;
in this, to induce him to pay her the ;
money she had expended in the pre- I
paration of a wedding trousseau. ;
Sooner or later, it i3 said, Collector J
of Customs Ide will be called as a wit
ness to relate what he knows of !
Haines' conduct during Mrs. Fohs* ef- j
forts to secure an interview with him '
at Port Townsend. The court-martial j
will probably last several days, and |
with the conclusion the findings of the j
board will be forwarded to the Sec
retayy of the Treasury.
LONDON, Dec. 29.â Mr. Bryan, who
arrived to-day from the Continent, said
that he had found his European trip
extremely interesting and instructive.
Asked whether his study of the finan
cial condition abroad had resulted in
any change in his views on the silver
question, he replied:
"Not the slightest."
Bryan regretted that lack of time
had prevented him making a more ex
tensive Investigation of the social and
industrial question which prevailed in
the European countries. lie -had been
received everywhere with the greatest
courtesy, he said, and every facility
had been extended him for investiga
tions along these lines.
Asked concerning 1 the possibilities of
the Democratic nomination for the
Presidency, he said he was compelled
to decline to discuss that subject in
any way, because of the possible inter
pretation to which his views might be
subjected in the United States.

There, will be no change in the attitude of this Government
toward the republic of Panama in consequence of the represen
tations made by General Reyes, the special envoy of Colombia.
The treaty is to be regarded as already made and accomplished,
and the United States will not draw back nor make any compro
mise to which Panama is nr-t a willing party.
This much was decided to-day at the longest Cabinet meet
ing which has been held in many months. The meeting was
called especially to consider the , note of General Reyes, making
demands upon" the United States, and the reply which should be
made to that* note. The meeting was not expected, the President
having announced before the holidays that,the Cabinet would not
be reassembled until January 5 ; but inasmuch as Reyes' note
had been received and an immediate answer had been requested,

and also in view of the fact that Secretary of State Hay is too
â¢much indisposed to give the matter his full and vigorous atten
tion, it was deemed wise to have it discussed in Cabinet before ar-
Secretary Root is at the present time assisting the President
and Secretary Hay in the negotiations. Root has seen General
Reyes several times recently and had a talk with him to-day, after
which Root and the President took' a long horseback ride.
Efforts are still being made to satisfy the British bondhold
ers and to placate Colombia by the payment of money. . No one
believes this will accomplish the result desired By this Govern
ment, and it is believed that Gendral Reyes' mission' will be termi
nated within a week, and tfait he will tlien follow Minister Herran,
whose departure is hourly expected. " This will be followed by a
severance of diplomatic arTd consular relations, and events on the
isthmus will be awaited with renewed .interest, because it is be
lieved Colombia will attempt Â»Â« invasion.

Forget Your Stomach and You'll
Have a Santa Claus Face.
HOW TO DO IT.
If there is one thing more than all
others that will give a man e. rferiora
and fri*>n<ilÂ©ss- e p|*-a.ii~Â«ce and make
Â¦"CinV morbid and "cranky"' and dis-
agreeable that thing is dyspepsia. It
makes one forget his friends and be-
come morose and irritable. He is so
wrapped up in his own misery that
he le inconsiderate of every one else.
Relieved ol this terrible and depressing
ailment, he again becomes a good fel-
low and a man among men.
Stuart's Dj'spepsia Tablets are. be-
yond Question the most effective and
popular rtmedy ever offered to the suf-
ferers uf this terrible disease. The thou-
sands and thousands of cures they have
brought about and the enormous in-
crease of their sales fully attest the
truth of this statement.
They are, above all. a natural rem-
edy. They possess exactly the same
properties that the gastric juices and
other digestive fluids of the stomach
possess and they actually do the diges-
tive work of the stomach and enable
that organ to rest and recuperate and
become round and well. They act in
a mild, natural manner and cause no
disturbance in the digestive organs.
They prevent any fermentation of the
food, which causes sour stomach. In
fact, under their influence the subject
forgets that he has a stomach and his
resulting cheerfulness presents a great
contrast to his former dejection.
Millions ff boxes of Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets are sold annually and they
are but in the dawn of their popularity.
Every mail brings letters of thanksgiv-
ing from grateful ones who have been
cured of this terrible disease. The fol-
lowing is one of hundreds received each
week:
Rev. J. R. Hoae of Wymore, Neb.,
"writes: "For six years I have been
troubled with dyspepsia. Last fall I
borame very much alarmed at some
eymptc-ms of heart trouble and came
to believe there was a sympathetic re-
lation between the two diseases, or
rather that the stomach trouble was the
cause of the heart disturbances. I hit
upon Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets for a
remedy and invested a dollar and a
half for three boxes, wnich. lasted me
three months, and I can eat any kind
of food I want and have a good, vig-
orous afpetite. Although I am 77 years
old, I now feel perfectly well and, with-
out being requested by any one. I make
this statement as a compliment to the
virtues of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets."
Costs Nothing If It Falls.
Any honest person who suffers from Rheu-
matism is welcome to this oSer. For years t
searched everywhere to find a specific for Rheu-
matism. For nearly 20 years I worked to tills
end. At last. In Germany, my search was re-
warded. I found a costly chemical- that did not
disappoint me as other Rheumatic prescriptions
had disappointed physicians everywhere.
I do not mean that Dr. Shoop's Rheumatic
Cure can turn bony Joints into flesh again. That
is impossible. But It will drive from the blood
the poison that causes pain and swellln?. and
then that is the end of Rheumatism. I know
this so well that I will furnish for a full month
my Rheumatic Cure on trial. I cannot cur* all
cases within a month. It would be unreason-
able to expect that. But mest cases will yield
within 30 days. This trial treatment will con-
vince you that Dr. Shoop's Rheumatic Cure la
a power against Rheumatism â a potent fore*
ae&inst disease that is Irresistible.
My offer Is made to convince you of my faith.
My faith is but the outcome of experienceâ of
actual knowledge. I know w^iat It can do. Aad
I know thlÂ« so well that I will furnish my rem-
edy on trial. Simply write ma a postal for my
book on Rheumatism. I will then arranjre with
a druggist in your vicinity so that you can se-
cure six bottles of Dr. Shoop's Rheumatic CurÂ«
to make the test. Tou maks take It a full month
on trial. ' If It succeeds the cost to you Is *.*> 30.
If it falls the less is mine and mine alons. it
will be left entirely to you. I mean that ex- .
actly. If you say the trial Is not satisfactory I
don't expect a penny from you. Â»;.{
I have no samples. Any mere 'sample that'
can affect chronic Rheumatism must be drugged
to the vergÂ« of danger. I use no such drugs,
for It Is dangerous to take them. Tou mutt get
the disease out of the blood. ' My remedy doea
that even in the most difficult, obstinate cases.
It has cured the oldest cases that I ever met.
and in all of my experience. In all of my 200O ,
tests. I never found another remedy that would >
cure one chrcnic case In ten.
Writo me attd I will send you the book. Try
my remedy for a month, for It can't harm you
anyway. If it faila the loss is mine.

Burrows, who is chairman of the Sen

Reed Smoot of Utah, said to-day that
the committee probably would meet on
Saturday, January 9, for the continua
tion of the inquiry. While Senator* Bur
rows has received no notification from
Senator Smoot, he thinks it probable
that the reply. of the latter to the
charges against him will be ready by
the time mentioned.
If denial is such as to chal
lenge the authenticity of the informa
tion upon which the accusations are
based it is the opinion of some of the
members of the committee, that the
authors of the charges will be given an
opportunity to prove them and in that
event there will be quite a general in

CARNEGIE' INSTITUTION
MAKES ANNUAL REPORT
NEW YORK, Dee. 20.â Very Rever
end George Deshon, superior general of
the Paulist Fathers of the United
States, died here shortly before mid
night, from heart failure. The de
ceased was 81 years of age and was
a prominent figure in religious circle3
and also among army men. He was
born in New London, Conn!, and was
a graduate of West Point, being a
member of the class of 1S43 and a class-,
mate of General U. S. Grant. He served
in the ordnance department of the
United States army for ten years and
after being converted to the Roman
Catholic faith resigned from the army
and studied for the priesthood.
Rev. Father Deshon was ordained as
a priest in 1856 and held a number of
important pastorates. He was one of
the founders of the Order of the Paul
ist Fathers and visited California in
1873 with five missionary priests. In
1S97 he was appointed superior gen
eral of the Paulist Fathers. He was
held in high esteem by his associates
and all with whom he came in contact.
the Beard of Health. He said that
City Attorney Lane had rendered a
decision which recognized the right of
the Commission to certify to but one
name if it si saw fit. He also said that
Attorney Lane had straddled the ques
tion by giving another decision against
the Civil Service Commission in an
analagous case.
Despite the City Attorney's decisions
for or against the legality of the com
mission's action tn the matter of certi
fying to .names on the eligible lists of
applicants for positions before the Civil
Service Commission, Rogers says that
the commission has the right under the
charter to refuse to certify, to more
than one name at a time.
The charter provisions which refer to
this matter are as follows:
"Article 13, section Sâ The Commis- f
sioners shall make rules to carry out
the purposes of this article and for ex
aminations, appointments, promotions
and removals, and in accordance with
its provisions may from time to time
mr.ke changes in the existing rules. All
rules and all changes therein shall be
forthwith pr'nted for distribution by
the Commissioners.
"Section 9 of article 13 (which is the
civil service article) â The head of the
department or office in which a position
classified under this article is to be
filled shall notify the Commissioners
of the fact and the Comrr.'ssioners shall
then certify to <Iie appointing officer
the name and address of one or more
candidates, not exceeding three, stand
ing highest upon .he ro;ister for the
class or grade to' which the position
belongs."
The now rule made by tl.e Civil Serv
ice Commission is as follows:
"Rule 19 â In answer to each requisi
tion for certificates from an eligible
list, only the highest name on such el
igible list shall be certified."
Regarding this rule, Mr. Rogers said:
"Seeing the possibility of favoritism
being shown shculd we certify to three
names, as we have done on re
quest up to June 1, 1002, we on that
date changed the rules governing the,
office, as the charter gives us the right
to do. Instead of being compelled to
give three names on requisition, we
now give but one â the highest. This
rule was made solely for the purpose
of preventing favoritism being shown
in the appointments to positions that
come under the Cfvil Service Commis
sion."
LONDON, Dec. 30.â The Shanghai
correspondent of the Daily Hail reports
that Russia is more inclined to make a
concession to China with regard to
Manchuria, and says that he learns
that unless Russia pays consideration
to the Chinese demands China will join
with Japan. The correspondent also
says that Yuan Shi Kai. who has been
intrusted with the task of negotiating
with Russia, has a decided predilection
for an alliance with Japan and that the
Empress Dowager also favors one.
The Mirror asserts that Japan's note
to Russia demands a material guaran
tee of honest intentions with regard to
Korea by a reduction of thÂ«Â» Russian
fleet in Far Eastern waters to half its
present strength.
It was said at the Japanese legation
here to-night that no sale had been ef
fected of the Argentine warships

It is said that the horses are being

The ultimate purpose is to put the
steel corporation in the same class of
conservative management as the
Standard Oil Company, and to attain
that end none of the necessary surgical
'operations in finance will be spared.
The work is to be taken up in a spirit
that is absolutely hostile to everything
done in the -past by Morgan, Perkins
and Schwab.
Whether the change in control will
also bring about a change in the presi
dency of the corporation is not known.
NEW YORK, Dec. 29.â Control of the
United States Steel Corporation, the
greatest industrial concern in the
world, is now completely and absolute
ly vested in the Rockefeller group of
capitalists and Henry Clay Frick, the
enemy of Andrew Carnegie.
Formal announcement of this fact
may not be made in set words, but the
effect of the change from the control
of J. Pierpont Morgan will soon be
made evident. John D. Rockefeller and
Frick have fully worked out their plans.
These provide for the complete elimina
tion of Morgan-Perkins-Schwab-Carne
gie interests from the active leadership
in the affairs of the steel corporation.
Standard Oil methods are hereafter
to be employed from top to bottom in
the management of the steel trust. The
first to feel this will be the men who
are drawing salaries of from Jft.OOO to
$25,000 a year. Many of thess men are
friends of those who dominate its man
agement. These employes; under the
new resime, must either stand for a
reduction in salaries or get out.
The new plan is to run tho corpora
tion for its owners, the stockholders,
and not for personal friends of the con
trolling interests. No employe will get
more than the actual value of his ser
vices.
Like all movements by the Rockefel
lers, control of the steel corporation
was accomplished secretly. It has been
in progress for more than six months.
It v.as not known even by anybody
familiar with what was going on that
Frick was associated with Rockefeller.
The alliance is said to he of recent ori
gin.

to the capital to receive it. Every ef

The Police Commission wanted to ap

vacant captaincy. The Civil Service
Commission claimed the right under
the charter to certify to it the name of

Commissioner Howell of the Police
Commission paid that he did not think
that the Civil Service Commission was
acting within the bounds of its juris
diction. He referred to the recent de
cision of Judge Soawell in a like case,
which did not uphold the Civil Serv-
Ifce CommisFion in its action. When
afked why the Police Commission had
made a requisition for three names in
stead of one. President Howell said
the board had wanted the tnree in case
they should wish to choose from them
to fill the vacant position of captain.
The demanding of but one name, he
said, would virtually leave the ap
pointing rower in the hands of the Civil
Service Commission.
Commissioner Drinkhouse stated that
personally he was in favor of taking
into consideration an appointee's work
on the i>o!;ce force and the action of
the board in making a requisition f ci
trine* 1 names was the outcome of Chief
"Witt man's desire to have Lieutenant
Burnett appointed to the vacancy, be

keeping with the desire of Chief Witt
man to have Burnett captain of the
centra! station, which lies in a district
with which he is thoroughly familiar.
The retirement of Captain Dunlery
of the Harbor station, which will
shortly occur, will create another va

President John XV. Rogers of the

commission's action in refusing to cer

by the Police Commission. He claimed
that under the new charter the Civil

TO BE ELIMINATED
STOCKTON, Dec. 29.â J. M. Welsh,
president of the Stockton Milling Com
pany, is authority 4 for the statement
that the Japanese Government has
been buying flour in immense quanti
ties from the Stockton and other Pa
cific Coast mills since last August. Mr.
Welsh, states further that Japan has
now sufficient Hour on hand to supply
the needs of her army and navy for a
w ; ar of at least one year's duration.
For almost five months past shipload
after shipload of flour ,has been
shipped from the mills on this coast
to Japan, but it was supposed by the
general public that it was consigned to
private dealers and for the general
trade. . It appears, however, that the
Japanese Government has bought the
flour quietly, but direct. Discussing
the matter, Mr. Welsh said:
"Japan has now a full stock of flour,
probably sufficient for her needs for a
year at least, which she has purchased
from Pacific Coast mills since last Au
gust. Furthermore, if she desired to
increase this stock she would order
from the Pacific Coast millsi as we can
lay flour down in Japan at least 50
cents per ton cheaper than Minne
apolis-can. - Milling wheat is now
worth exactly the same in Minneapolis
as it is here. We can make it into
flour for exactly the same cost as
Minneapolis can. Consequently Japan
Pacific Coast Mills Have Been Supply
ing Cargoes Since August.
JAPAN STORES FLOUR.
The expected clash of Russia and
Japan is the main topic of talk in
army, navy and mercantile circles.
There are many predictions that the
navy of Japan will make a splendid
record for quick handling and effect
ive fighting in the event of a mix-up.
The notion prevails that the Japanese
ships are up to date in point of speed
and armament and that, the men be
hind the guns are fairly well up in
marksmanship. It is fancied that Japan
may get the advantage on land at the
outset, but the Japanese in the end
may be forced to yield to the power
ful strength of the Russian army.
tables from Europe or New York and
land them in good condition at any
Japanese or Chinese port. On tht
other hand, such products can be
shipped from this port to Yokohama in
fifteen days and lande"d in prime shape.
So you can see that San Francisco is
the preferred shipping point, and if
San Francisco's exporters fail to take
advantage of their opportunity San
Francisco is not to be sympathized
with. -
"But this is no new idea. Our war
experience in the Philippines showed
the world that San Francisco cannot
be beaten as a shipping point for army
and naval supplies. During the Boxer
trouble in China 70 per cent of all the
stores used ;by, the combined armies
and navies were shipped from San
Francisco, and even in times of 'peace
an average of CO per* cent of the food
products shipped from. this port to. the
Orient are consumed by foreign war
ships." y
NO ORGANIZED ACTIVITY.
Secretary Scott of the Chamber of
Commerce said that no, organized
movement was being made by. that
body to take advantage of the prob
able conflict between Russia and
Japan. " /
"Whatever 1 is being done in that di
rection," Scott explained, "is individual
effort through the representatives in
the Orient of California firms. Just
now the Chamber is directing its ef
forts toward prevailing upon the State
Department at Washington to main
tain and extend American trade In the
Orient as against the mercantile cru
sade in which almost every European
nation is participating. Our market
in Manchuria is seriously threatened by
European rivals, and we hope to have
our Government apply needed protect
ive measures."
Several large grain dealing firms of
this city have received telegraphic ad
vices from Seattle to the effect that
agents of the Russian Government in
that place are offering to purchase con
siderable quantities of hay, barley and ,
oat3. It is well understood that sup
plies . of this kind must come from
California, although the shipments
may be made from Seattle to the
Orient.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 29â Only
by words cauzht now and again can
an inkling be obtained of Russia's in
tention. From such straits I am firm
ly Impressed by the strong current of
irritation prevailing here, under cover
of ah outward air of calmness. This
irritation is centered largely against
the English and American people on
account of their undoubted sympathies
for Japan. To understand this Â¦ fully
you must realize that in the highest
circles dominating politics here the
conviction is irrevocably imbedded
that, without the support and encour
agement of those.two countries, Japan
would never declare war. upon Russia.
For the next ten days or so there
will be a calm, which cannot but be
looked upon as ominous. It is an open
secret that Japan would not accept
Russia's last proposition and It was re
turned for reconsideration as unaccept
able. Those who hurried tq^assure the
world that no ultimatum had been sent
were technically correct. Ultimatums,
like formal declarations of war, are out
of date. Statesmen have other meth
ods of procedure to-day.
From what I can glean of the tone
here, Russia will not recede an Inch.
She cannot. The policy of this country
A Vladivostok telegram to the Novoe
Vremya says that all hopes of peace
are not yet lost, but travelers who have
just "arrived from there heard only of
the possibilities of war, preparations
for the same being feverishly hurried.
All depends upon Japan. Russia has
planted her flag, according to the
statesman's opinion given me yester
day, and ' Japan cannot afford not to
fight.
has been laid down on hard, unbend
ing lines. Russian tradition, inherited
from Peter the Great, is to rot draw
back from a position she has once tak
en. The present Emperor, while an
apostle of peace, is strictly Russian.
An amiably worded reply will surely
be given to Japan, and probably also
a kindly paternal lecture upon the folly
of trying to match herself against Rus
sia. That may or may not be consid
ered an ultimatum, but It will be Rus
sia's final wordâ not Russia's declara
tion oi war.
Russia, as was officially assured me
at the Foreign Office to-day, wants no
war. At the same time she cannot bow
to Japan.
Russia will declare no war. Japan
may do so. Russia will readily accept
the necessity forced upon her of fight
ing.

TOKIO. Dec. 20.â Another Cabinet
coujicil was held to-day, lasting four
hours. The ordinances passed yester
day by the Cabinet council authorizing
a guarantee of the principal and in
terest of an issue of 10,000,000 yen de
bentures for the purpose of expediting
work on the Seoul-Fusan Railway and
which provided for all possible military
expenses for the protection cf the rail
way and other interests, also author
ized the Government to utilizr; 30,000,000
yen, the proceeds of the Chinese war
indemnity, which hitherto has been de
voted to educational and other pur
poses, as a war fund. In addition au
thorization is given to lssiÂ» treasury
notes payable in five years and to raise
loans payable in t%vo years to an un
limited extent.
"The main point of this whole
thing," he said, "is San Francisco's
unequaled opportunity, to take com
mercial advantage of any sudden or
unusual demand for foodstuffs in the
Orient. If little Japan and big Russia
come to actual fighting, they must ob
tain their commissary supplies from
the nearest available point. .That
point is San Francisco. We beat the
Suez route forty days between Europe
and Yokohama, and we beat New York
via the\same route thifty-five days.
What that saving of time^amounts to in
the transportation of perishable freight
hardly needs explanation. But it may
not be superfluous to state that, on ac
count of the heat encountered at all
times of year on the Sues route, it
would be impossible to shin such prod
ucts as preserved meats, fruits or vege-
'"We obtained the order through our
J>ranch. house" at Shanghai," said Louis
Getz yesterday, "and if we had not had
a branch house there the order probably
would have gone to a European agency.
If the meat could be procured on this
coast we could buy it here, but as it
is, we -have been obliged to send east
for it. The first special trainload is
now en route from Kansas City, and
will arrive in time for shipment on
the Coptic, due to sail on January 15.
The consignment consists of 2093 bar
rels, each barrel containing 350 pounds,
and it will be in. as good condition
when it reaches its destination as when
it left the packing house."
Getz declined to disclose where the
meat would be landed, but. it is pretty
generally understood that Port Arthur
is its destination.
"The remainder of the order will.be
shipped just as rapidly as we can find
marine transportation for it," said he.
"I have no doubt that other San Fran
cisco firms will, directly or indirectly,
reap some benefit from the warlike
situation in the Orient, for San Fran
cisco is the logical shipping point for
all kinds of provisions." '.;Â¦ -
NATURAL BASK OF SUPPLIES.
Secretary L. R. Tuttle then took up
the theme. ftiV-*
That this city would derive material
profit from actual war between Russia
and Japan has been practically demon
strated by the contract secured by
Getz Bros. & Co. It calls for the de
livery of 3,000,000 pounds of cured beef
to the Russian base of supplies in the
Orient, and every pound of the meat
will be shipped from San Francisco,
which means work and wages for San
Francisco residents.
SAX FRAXCISCO'S CHANCE.
"The directorate of the Toyo Kisen
Kaisha is very close to the Japanese
Government. If war was imminent
they would know it, and the first use
they would make of their knowledge
would be to look out for the ships. I*n
the event of war the Government
would certainly take the three ships
and would want them without delay.
W-hen trouble really threatens we will
be notified in plenty 'of time to make a
proper disposition of ourt freight and
passenger contracts and turn over the
ships to the Government in time for
them' to have them where they want
them when hostilities begin. If there
was any chance of the Nippon Maru's
running into trouble neither passen
gers nor shippers would be asked to
share it. No bookings have been can
celed and for the immediate present we
are not expecting war."
The ordinary marine insurance policy
does not cover loss by capture, seizure
or detention at the hands of an un
friendly power, and most of the Nip
pon's big cargo will be covered by this
war* risk, the rate of* which was quoted
yesterday at 1 per cent.
The Nippon Maru will take from here
sixty-five cabin passengers, most of
therr^ United States Government- em
ployes bound for Manila, where the
liner calls on this trip. The report that
forty intending passengers, alarmed at
the situation in the Orient, had can
celed their bookings on the Nippon
Maru, was denied yesterday by-.the lo
cal representatives of the Toyo Kisen
Kaisha and by Passenger Agent A. G.
D. Kerrcll.
At the office of the Toyo Kisen Kai
sha the prospect for early trouble Is
considered lightly. VV. H. A very, -the
company's agent here, is^at present in
the East. B. A. Harnett, who is acting
in his place, said yesterday that If
there .was, the. least danger of war be
fore the Nippon Maru is scheduled to
reach Japan he would have been noti
fied. He said:
The Nippon will carry from here
about 4000 tons of valuable merchan
dise. She is under subsidy to the.Jap
anese Government and was built with
the view of being used as an auxiliary
cruiser in case of emergency. The Nip
pon and her sister?, the America Maru
and the Hongkong Maru, which make
up the Toyo Kisen Kaisha's fleet in the
service between here and the - Orient,
are particularly fine steamships,
speedy and in splendid condition. It is
only a few months since the three lin
ers passed their annual Government
trial, and all proved better than the
requirements of the act under which
they receive a liberal subsidy.
Any of the boats would prove tempt
ing to a prize-hunting enemy, and no
body realizes this better than the mer
chants who have intrusted their wares
to the Japanese line.
IJXER CARRIES PASSENGERS.
Something of the seriousness with
which the commercial world views the
situation in the Far East was indicated
yeBterday by a cable dispatch received
from London quoting a rate of 1 per
cent war risk on the cargo of the Jap
anese liner, Nippon Maru, which sails
to-day for the Orient. Under the cir
cumstances and especially in view of
the fact that Japan possesses a mag
nificent navy in the Pacific, this rate is
considered nigh.

nothing regarding their deliberation was made public. The new ordinances are believed to provide completely for all emergencies.

BERKELEY, Dec. 29. â The Oak

begin operations in a few days on the
extension of the University-avenue
branch car line along University ave
nue from the present terminus at San
Pablo avenue to Third street. This
step has long been contemplated and
will be a great convenience to the
West Berkeley public. It will form
a connection between East and West
Berkeley and make accessible to the
people of all Berkeley the main line
trains of . the Southern Pacific Com
pany at Third street. *-;':hj
The first step making for this im
provement was taken last night when
the Oakland Transit Company's attor
ney asked the Board or Trustees for
permission to abandon a franchise
that had been previously granted to
run from the intersection of San Pab
lo avenue and University to Bristol
street, to Eighth, to University, to
Third street. The attorney stated that it
was the desire of the Transit Company
to run straight down University ave
nue to the bay, instead of taking the
zigzag route. The Trustees signified
.their willingness to accede to the
Transit Company's wishes and a reso r
lution declaring the franchise forfeit
ed will be adopted at the next meet^

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111* Broadway. Dec. 29.
One Grand Jury has^already investi
gated the attempt that was made by
C. S. Mac Mullan to extort $500 from the
Southern Pacific Company and another
Grand Jury now (n session is going to
look further into the matter.
MacMullan admit? that he made the
call upon Jere Burke of the Southern
Pacific Company, the details of which
were published in The Call this morn
ing, but he denies that the request for
5500 was blackmail. He *ays that he
merely sought "a loan to be devoted to
an effort to increase the local travel on
its ferries between Alameda County*
and San Francisco."
It now transpires that a short time
after the employment of MacMullan
the Supervisors were made aware of his
cumin. nioations with the officials cf
the Southern Pacific Company, both
written and oral. This information
was discussed in a secret session of the
board, but the discussion was never
givon out, and MacMullan was allowed
to continue his work uf "playing" the
information he discovered, while being
paid by the Supervisors, against the
officials of the corporations.
Supervisor. J. M. Kelley is frank
enough to say that he was originally in
favor of MacMullan, but that the Su
pervisors maÂ«ie two mistakes â the first,
that of making a blind contract, and
the second that of continuing MacMul
lan in employment after they knew
that he had been attempting to "hold
\ix>" the Southern Pacific Company.
This is what Mr. Kelley says:
SUPERVISOR KELLEY TALKS.
â¢"We might just as well admit that
we made several mistakes and take
whatever criticism is offered. In the
first place every member of our board
was in favor of the employment of
MacMullan. It seemed like a good
proposition to us and we all took it.
But the mistake was that we entered
into a blind contract and did not look
where it was going to land us. I can
only speak for myself, but I feel cer
tain that there was not a member of
the board that thought that MacMul
lan would make more than a few hun
dred dollars out of his proposition and
we did not look into the future.
"The second mistake was that we
continued MacMullan in the employ of
the county after we knew that he had
been talking to officials of the South
ern Pacific Company upon the strength
of that employment. I can only take
comfort from the fact that all public
officials are likely to make mistakes
and this is one of mine.
"As I understand the exact condition
of affairs it is this: MacMullan ap
plied to the Board of Supervisors for
this employment and' submitted a com
munication that gave us to understand
that there was a few thousand dollars'
worth of property that was not being
assessed, and he agreed for one-half
of the taxes to show us where It was.
The proposition did not strike us as
a very large one and every member of
the board thought that it was a good
scheme.
"Shortly before we employed Mac-
Mullan, but after he was absolutely
sure that he was going to get the ap
pointment, he began negotiations with
the Southern Pacific Compouy's offi
cials, i
"We did not know of these negotia
tions at the time we employed him,
but the story reached our ears later.
The second mistake was made at that
time, when we ought to have immedi
ately dispensed with his services.
"Whether we can be held or not for
these claims is a question, and the
charges of blackmail that are floating
around make the case very much
â¢worse than if we simply had to deal
with a demand the size of which was
not anticipated. However, we will have
to face it and do the best we can under
unfortunate circumstances."
MITCHELL IS DETERMINED.
Chairman John Mitchell of the Board
of Supervisors is out for a. full and
complete Investigation, and he is de
termined to know all about the Mac-
Mullan deal, both with regard to the
county of Alameda and the effort to
sell information to the Southern Pa
cific Company. Mr. Mitchell is Just as
decided as he was at the outset and
he declares that bo far as he is con-;
cerned MacMullan will have *.o sue for
every cent he gets from Alameda Coun
ty. Mr. Mitchell said to-day:
"I <Jo not consider that there is a
dollar owing MacMullan from the coun- :
ty, and if he gets anything hs will have
to sue for it, so far as my vote is con
cerned. The whole matter turns upon
the question of whether we were em
ploying a man to report to us or a
man to report to the County Assessor.
We agreed to pay this man if he fur
nished us certain information. Instead
of that he furnished some information
to the County Assessor. What that
information is or was we have no offi
cial knowledge and we are left to pay
the bills and take the Orunt of the
whole trick. So far as I am concerned
MacMullan shall never get a cent from
this county without a suit. â¢ .
"So far as the negotiations between
MacMullan and the Soutnern Pacific
Company are concerned I do not care
to discuss those now. I do not think
th*t MacMullan will deny them."
C. S. MacMullan to-day issued a
statement of his side of the case. This
statement was prepared by MacMullan
Professor O'Neill will resume his
work in the chair of organic and
Â¦physiological chemistry when the new
term begins.
The fields In Japan are being operated on the
same ' limited scale, but are being constantly
developed and extended. You may gain some
Idea of the limited output in Japan when I say
that last year it was a.000,000 barrels, while
here In California it was 25,000,000 barrels.
AH of these fields yield different qualities of
oil, buf none are equal to the products of
Pennsylvania. As a rule, they are about equal
to the California oils. When they first began
to bring: oil to the surface in the Far East
they allowed the benzine to run into the sea,
not -knowing its value, but how it is being
saved and shipped to different countries.
There is little danger of California being af
fected by these new fields, as the increasing
use of oil will abeorb all that Is produced for
years to come.
JAPAX OUTPUT LIMITED.
'They ueo oil almost entirely in the locomo
tives of Russia and in many of the steamers
plying the Caspian Sea. It is refined at Baku
and then taken to Batoum, on the Black Sea,
for shipment. Some Is transported by pipe
lines and some by tank cars. These fields are
owned chiefly by the Rothschilds and the No
bels, who reap enormous profits from them. The
Standard OH Company of this country has no
interest In the fields, but I believe there Is an
understanding between the corporations.
The fields in Burmah and Sumatra are new 1
enterprises and limited in extent, but they are
being rapidly developed. There is a growing
demand in the East for kerosene, especially In
India and China. The people in Asia are now
using kerosene largely, instead of candles and
seed oils.
I found the Russian oil to be very different
from that of California or Pennsylvania. It Is
not as good an oil as that of Pennsylvania, hav
ing a smaller percentage of kerosene in its com
position. It is about the same as California
oil. A large portion of the oil taken from the
wells at Baku is used for fuel, but not in the
raw state as here. It is refined and the residue
is used tor fuel, the distillate being refined into
benzine and kerosene.
BERKELEY, Dec. 29. â Edmund
O'Neill, associate professor of chem
istry at the University of California,
has returned on the steamship Si
beria from a trip around the world.
During his six months' absence Pro
fessor O'Neill attended the fifth Inter
national Congress of Chemists at Ber
lin and thon visited thÂ§ oil fields of
Russia and the Far East. 'â¢Â¦'Â¦
The convention of chemists which
Professor O'Neill attended was com
posed of some 2500 delegates, repre
senting schools and cwleges all over
the world. It was in session ten days,
during whinh papers were read by
many leading chemists. Professor
O'Neill read a paper on "California Pe
troleum." He was elected a vice pres
ident of the international organization.
Of greater interest to California,
however, is Professor O'NeilVs. visit
to the European and Asiatic oil fields,
which have lately developed^into
extensive enterprises. He examined
the operations at Baku, Russia, { the
eldest oil fields and the most exten
sive in the world, and those at Bur
mah, Sumatra and Japan, which are
all comparatively new.
USE OP OIL IX RUSSIA.
Of his observations Professor O'Neill
speaks as follows:
"My sin Is that I honestly reported
all errors thus far discovered and that
I failed to cut out from my, list the
derelict corporations bo used to favor
able consideration from aspiring offi
cials, and the sin of Assessor Dalton is
that he assessed such reported property
at the value reauired by law.
"If any statement has been made that
I have agreed to divide my commis
sions with anybody or that I act in
collusion with any public official, it is
unqualifiedly false, j
"As to the matter of blackmail, there
is simply nothing In it. The railroad
people are trying to turn a recognition
of friendjy services to me by one of
their officials, which recognition was
made previous to my employment by
the Board of Supervisors, into a case
of blackmail and extortion, when- the
favor asked was a" loan to" be devoted
to an effort to increase the local travel
on its ferries between Alameda County
and San Francisco."
"My employment by the county was
to ascertain what errors appeared in
the assessment roll whereby the coun
ty was losing the revenue to which it
was entitled. In the event of any er
rors I discovered appeared in the as
sessment roll of one year only, or even
two years, I was to receive no compen
sation therefor, and the county was to
get the full benefit of the revenue col
lected by virtue of the discovery of
those errors, and only in the event that
I discovered errors from which the
county had suffered the loss of a reve
nue for three years was I to receive
any compensation and that compen
sation was to be one-half of the
amount collected on the property thus
discovered. In no event was the ex
pense of my employment to be a bur
den on the taxpayers heretofore list
ed. In other words, I was to dig up
outsiders who had evaded taxation, who
would pay my compensation, and in
addition thereto, a similar amount to
the county or its tax collector.
"I now hold the distinctive position
of being the only person in the employ
of the State, county or city, who is no
expense to the taxpayer, but find my
'salary* in the pockets of outsiders who
are to pay additional thousands, here
tofore lost to the county, Into the pub
lic treasury. The better I fare from
such employment, proportionately
greater was the government to benefit
as on many errors reported I was to
receive no compensation under my con
tract. If my commissions amounted to
but $800, the county must necessarily be
a greater loser by my employment than
if my commissions amounted to $8000
In any event, the county was to be a
great gainer by my employment.
"Immediately following my employ
ment I told certain members of the
Board of Supervisors that I would
probably make more money on my con
tract than they anticipated. Super
visor Horner replied, 'The more you
make the better we like it, for the more
the county will make.'
"Supervisor Kelley said: "Make every
dollar you can for the county, for you
are In on It.'
"Supervisor Rowe said: 'See that no
property escapes assessment, as we
want everybody to bear their just pro
portion of the taxes, and the more you
make the more the county will make.'
"A wealthy taxpayer of this county
tells me that he will wager JS10.000 to
$2500 that he can secure the signatures
of 10.000 taxpayers in this county to an
indorsement of the employment of me
by the Board of Supervisors to expert
the roll, and I take it from the many
people who have spoken to me In re
gard to the matter that the board's
action in this particular is generally in
dorsed and certainly should be by all
intelligent people.

Nicholas with exerting undue influence
ever the father, who, according to the
son, was mentally unsound and incom
petent. The brother charged his sister
with many forms of improper conduct
toward the father in his last days.
All of this has been set aside by thb
compromise. The trust clause will be
modified in execution, the contest will
be dismissed and the will offered for
probate as originally filed. .Reed &
Nusbaumer represent the proponents
of the will and Attorney Asa V. Men
denhall has charge or the son's inter
ests.
The bitter family fight threatened j
over the estate of tne late Henry H. j
Meyer, a pioneer capitalist, has been
averted by a settlement of the will con
test brought by Henry A. Meyer
against his sisters, Mrs. Sophie Nicho
las and Mrs. Ida Gentry, all of them
children of the old pioneer. On the
eve of the battle in court the attorneys
and their clients got together and ar
ranged a compromise by which all of
the parties interested are satisfied.
When the father's will was opened
it was found that Meyer had left a
large share of his $70,000 estate to his
daughter, Mrs. Nicholas. To Mrs. Gen
try a life interest in a portion of the
estate was bequeathed, while the son
Henry found that he was given only
an income of $24 a month from an iron
bound trust created by the will with
Mr?. Nicholas as trustee.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 29.
While conversing with friends on an
afternoon train from Sacramento to
day A. S. Moore, a member of the
wholesale commission house of George
A. Moore & Co., 203 California street,
San Francisco, suddenly expired in his
seat, having been stricken with heart
disease. Death came so quickly that
Moore gave not a warning sign to his
companions save a clutching spasm and
groan of pain as his body toppled for
ward from his seat.
The fatality occurred shortly before
2 o'clock, when the train was running
westbound from Altamont to Liver
more. Moore's friends summoned Con
ductor Harry Brydges and physician
was called to the stricken man, but
the doctor could only pronounce him
dead. At Llvermore a disptch was sent
to this city notifying Coroner Mehr
mann. The body was brought through
on the train to Oakland, where the
Coroner took charge of it.
Moore had been out in the interior
of the State on a business trip, being
a traveling salesman for tha firm, in
which he was associated with his
brother. He was also representing the
California Vlgorit Company. George
A. Moore, the brother, wired to Gait,
where the deceased merchant's sud
denly bereaved wife was staying tem
porarily. Moore resided In San Fran
cisco.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Dec. 29.
"But, Judge, can't I get my money?"
"I don't know anything about that,"
said Judge Ellsworth, "but you must
give ud the child as he is."
Mrs. Hayes took her baby and de
parted Immediately for her home In
Vallejo. She assured those who of
fered assistance that she would speed
ily settle with Mrs. Hayes for the $2 75
worth of garments that Judge Ells
worth had directed Mrs. Hussey to
leave undisturbed on the baby.
"But, Judge," interrupted Mrs. Hus
sey, "the clothes the chid has on I
made and furnished. This coat cost
me $2 75, and can't I get my money?"
' With that outburst Mrs. Hussey com
menced to unbutton the little coat that
covered the baby.
"Madam, you cannot disrobe that
child in this courtroom," commanded
Judge Ellsworth. "You must surrender
the child in the condition in which he
is now."
Mrs. Hayes is the wife of Morgan
Hayes, known among oilmen as a pro
moter and expert in that commodity.
The couple have been married seven
years and their home for a long time
was in Oakland. They are new sep
arated. Last May little Stanley was
put out to board with Mrs. Hussey.
According to the mother and Mrs. Hus
sey, the board was to be paid by the
husband, but a bill for $68 has piled up.
When Mrs. Hayes tried to get the child
she found her efforts thwarted. The
mother sued out a writ of habeas cor
pus, through Attorney A. P. Leach,
and this morning, in response to the
Sheriff's subpe,na, ..Mr&j., Hussey pro
duced .the child before Judge Ellsworth.
Mrs. Hussey explained that her rea
son for holding the child was that the
father had ordered her under *no cir
cumstances to allow the mother to get
possession of the offspring.
Attorney Leach brought out the fact
that the mother -had placed the -child
with Mrs. Hussey in May; that the
father had not seen the child but once,
and that time was in October; that he
had not kept a promise to pay for the
baby's board and care, and that Mrs.
Hussey did not expect to see Hayes
again until next month.
"There is no reason, madam, why
you can detain this child," declared
Judge Ellsworth. "It Is ordered that
the child be turned over to the mother,
the petitioner in this hearing."
UNBUTTONS CHILD'S COAT.
SEPARATED FROM HUSBAND.
"No, no,"' replied Mrs. Hayes. "I
can and will pay for the clothing as
soon as I return home."
It was the climax to a struggle Mrs.
Hayos had been making for several
weeks to regain the custody of her
child, which last May was placed in
the Hussey home at 505 East Eleventh
street to be given care until such time
as the mother could arrange to keep
the baby herself.
Compelled by order of court to sur
render little Stanley Hayes, 3 years
old, to his mother, Mrs. Bessie Hayes
of Vallejo, Mrs. Walter Hussey at
tempted to disrobe the infant in Judge
Ellsworth's court this morning, de
claring that she had paid for the
clothes on the baby's back and she
purposed to get her money or the gar
ments.
Tiromptly his Honor stopped the
extraordinary move that the baby's
former custodian had made, and stern
ly did Judge Ellsworth rebuke the
woman as she tried to unfasten the
baby's outer garments in her effort to
remove the little one's clothing before
she reluctantly gave over the infant
to the anxious mother.
Bystanders in the courtroom, dum
founded by the occurrence, rushed to
the trembling parent as she hugged
her baby to Iper breast and offered
their assistance, financial if need be,
to relieve the situation.

* The Grand Jury filed its final report
>vith Presiding Judge Murasky yester
day aad was discharged from further
duty. The report censures' the admin
istration of the County Clerk's office,
which ofiice, it says, is conducted in
a criminal manner. Fault la found
â¢with the Police Courts for being too
lenient with offenders and imposing
fines too small to deter offenders from
commuting: crimes.
Just before filing its report, the
<"5ranrl Jury seriously discussed the in
rlictment of a certain money lender for
withholding moneys from the salary
Â¦warrants of several deputies employed
by County Clerk Mahoney. The mem
bers of the Grand lury were unan
imously in favor of bringing in the in
dictment, bu before taking action
"Ailed Assistant District Attorney
Whiting into consultation. Whiting
adviÂ«~d the Grand Jury that there fvas
a flaw in the law, which prevented the
bringing of tkÂ£ indictment, and it was
compelled to abandon its Intention. The
report of the Committee on County
Clerk, composed of Harry M. Kelly,
chairman; James A. Snook and E. J.
Benedict, was adopted. On the sub
ject of warrant shaving, it says:
BLOW' AT MOXKY LENDERS. â¢
TVe fin3 that one of the most unbusinesslike
rules has been followed by which a cierk is

This rule ehould be absolutely abolished ana
Â«he employes in the County Clerk's office, in
fact all officers of the municipal government,
should only be paid at the end of each month.
The Auditor should not accept any order from
money breakers. buÂ«. only deliver his voucher on
the treasury to the employes at the end of the
month, and such voucher should be duly In
dorsed by the employe himself and not by out
fcldc parties. aÂ» has been the custom heretofore.
The report continues:
The cf2ce of the County Clerk wm found to
be managed In the most loose and criminal
manner. Salaries wer* deliberately paid to per

The witness had first entered Duns
muir's employ as an errand boy. In
September, 1901, he saw Edna Wal
lace Hopper and Judge Coyne at San
Leandro and he said they had asked
him to be a witness for their side. On
the following day he had written to
Mrs. Hopper telling her he could not
testify to the unsoundness of Mr.
Dunsmuir. He declared he received
no more than his J75 per month sal
ary from the Dunsmuir company.
VICTORIA* B. C, Dec. 29. â Ed
ward Brock of Oakland, weigher for
R. Dunsmulr & Co., formerly bellboy
at the Grand Hotel, San Francisco,
gave evidence in> the Hopper-Duns
muir will'case this morning that Alex
ander Dunsmuir had always acted ra
tionally and intelligently so far as he
knew. He said he made frequent vis
its to San Leandro and remained there
at times for a week*
In cross examination he said he had
gone to visit Alexander Dunsmuir at
his office at different times and before
he starte'd to work for R. Dunsmuir
& Co. Alexander Dunsmuir had told
the witness not to speak to him at
the office for fear the other clerks
would think he was too familiar.
While engaged as bellboy at the
Grand Hotel he had carried on an
average of one to three cocktails each
day to Alexander Dunsmuir's apart
ments. Dunsmuir's habit was to get
some buttermilk and oysters in the
evening and witness never 'saw any
liquor other than a bottle of ale.

Witness Tnat He Was Ask- (
ed to Testify for Plaintiff
DENIAL OF INTEMPERANCE
Having carefully investigated, the matter,
we find that the building of side tracks or
spurs to warehouses Is simply an advance In
progress, and that while steam cars have
superseded teams and ox wagons, electric cars
have taken the place of horse cars, so It must
inevitably follow, as a matter of progression,
that goods chould be carried or ewltcheil direct
from depots of rail lines into warehouses
therein saving cost or teaming and time as
well, and as all expenses incidental to puch
handling are borne by consumers, we think
that the greatest amount of good to the larg
est number Is made manifest by switching
cars containing goods direct to warehouse,
thereby eavlng cost of extra handling, and we
therefore recommend that the Board of Su
pervisors of the city and county of San Fran
cisco do all they possibly can to encourage
spur tracks and rail connections between
depots and business houses. as well as ware
houses where it is found practicable.
The Grand Jury also praises the ad
ministration of Auditor Harry Baehr.
District Attorney Byingttfn. Sheriff
Lackmann, the Board of Works -and
other departments of the city govern
ment. In its report on the Board of
Supervisors it says, regarding spur
tracks:
COM3IEXDS SOME OFFICIALS.
This practice has grown up â notably in the
Board of Public Works and Department of
Electricity, of selecting temporary appointees,
putting tlipm to work, and after they have
bt-en Â«n']>loye.\ for two or three weeks, notify
ing ihe Civil Service Commission that /Â«uch ap
pointments have been made and asking their
approval of the eame. It will be observed
from an examination of the section of the
charter above quoted that the approval of the
commission is a necessary condition precedent
to the validity of these appointments, and that
without euch approval no salary can legally be
UrJiwn by any person so appointed.
In view of the recent scandalous develop
ment before the jury in connection with the
Couiity Clerk's office, we recommend that our
representatives in the State Legislature, at Its
next s-i-fhion. urge the submiwion to the people
of an amendment to section SVi of article 11
of the State constitution, whereby the l?ouhty
Clerk's olfice and other county offices be made
subject to the civil service provisions of the
charter. ,

AUBURN, N. Y., Dec. 29.â Frank
White, a negro, was put to death in
the electric chair at the State Prison
here to-day for the murder of George
Clare, a farmer of Serlba, by shooting.
Six contacts, each of 1740 volts 7V 2 am
peres, were applied before White was
pronounced dead. After the fourth
contact a strange gurgling in .his throat
made the physicians step back and
horrified the spectators. The contact
was quickly repeated, but still the
stethoscope recorded cardiac action,
and two more contacts were given.
During the second contact the head
electrodes flashed brilliantly and' there
was an odor, of burning hair. The exe
cutioner said it was the sponge be
neath the electrode. He adjusted it
-more tightly before the next shock.
- Among those who made a test with
the stethoscope was Dr. U. B. Stein
of Buffalo, and he reported that the
heart had not ceased to beat. When he
had resumed his scat in the front row
and", the fifth contact was turned on.
Stein suddenly pitched forward and
fell to the floor in a swoon.
State Electrician Davis, in charge of
the execution, explained- the gurgling
in White's throat by raying that he
held his breath for a few moments
after tho first contact and it was sim
ply the air escaping from his lungs.
He declared that White was practically
dead after the first contact.
White was about 25 years of age. He
had worked for Clare ai.d murdered
him for his money.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â Minister
Lyon has reported to the State Depart
ment from Monrovia/ Liberia, under
date of November 4 last, the details
of the "massacre in the depths of an
African forest of a white missionary
named John T. Tate and all of his fol
lowers, eighteen in number. It appears
that the. massacre took place March
15, 1D01, yet this, the first. detailed ac
count, has just come to hand in an
affidavit by Mrs. Mary L. Allen, a white
missionary, at Nouna Kroo", Liberia.
She had the story from Feme of the
native Doo tribesmen, who knew of the
killing.
Tate had a large mission and farm,
and besides he maintained a consider
able school in the jungle. Altogether
nineteen people were in the mlssipn
when It was surrounded in the night
by-the tribesmen. The first man who
answered a knock at the door was shot.
The interpreter next was shot and as
Tate appeared and tried to protect the
body of the interpreter he, too, was
shot ar.d'rut to pieces. The Doos then
killed all the remaining inmates of the
house, cut off their hands and, placing
the bloodv members ma coffin, sent
them back to their people as trophies.
In explanation of their action the Doos
said: .
â¢'We have no fight with the white
man. .But* if we do not kill him now
he will bring his country to make war
upon us."
Minister Lyon, on the strength of
this affidavit, communicated with the
Llberian Secretary of State with a view
to securing fuller information and per
haps the punishment of the perpetra
tors of the massacre.

INVOLVED IX A SCANDAL
OTTAWA. Ontario, Dec. 23.â The
building of a Canadian armored cruiser
for the Great Lakes has caused com
ment on the treaty supposed to restrict
such a movement. Under Secretary of
<?tate Pope points out that no treaty
oxists between Great Britain and the
United States limiting the number and
armament of vessels to be maintained
by the United States and Canada on
the Great Lakes. There is an agree
ment to cease placing them there after
six months' notice by either country.
Pope doubts if it is binding.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 29.â The State
Department has not been informed up
to this moment that the Canadian Gov
ernment contemplates placing an ar
mored cruiser or. the lnlces. in addition
to the few pmall and insignificant naval
vessels now maintained there. Recent
ly the Canadian Government laid'dmvn
-a coup'e of revenue cutters for lake
FerÂ»1ce. ar.d although these, being of
mo<5*Tn type, were better vessels than
those heretofore Â«>:nplr:yed for this
Â¦work. ' their construction was not re
garded here as violating the treaty. It
appears that a United States naval of
ficer visited thÂ»Â» placf where thÂ«^ vessels
Â«-Â«">Â«Â» being built ar.d examined the
construction, a fact that gave rise to
po-nie feeling on the part of the officials
when they learned of the visit.
As poÂ«-'n as Congress reconvenes after
the holiday recess there will be a re
newa!. without doubt, of the attempt
which has b^en made annually for the
last ten years to secure a repeal or
modification of that section of the
Rush treaty between the United States
end Groat Britain that limits the use
of naval vessels on the lakes. Repre
sentative Wiliiam Alden Smith of
Michigan, believing that the Canadian
Government is about to enter a formal
protest asrairst the location of the
â¢-'Â¦oposed United States naval training
Station on the Great Lakes, is prepared
to renew with Borce the attack upi'n the
Rush treaty, holding that it has had a

Now it is reported that the agents of
the Western Pacific, acting for Bart
nett in his absence, have been making
overtures to Yard, the basis of which,
it is said, is a prpposition for a trans
fer of his interests along the Feather
River to a point near Oroville or a
joint agreement whereby the Western
Pacific can use about sixty miles of the
Butte and Plumas rcadv.ay in order to
make connections with Chico, Marys
ville and other points on the proposed
route of the road to San Francisco.
Bartnett is expected back in this city
in about two weeks and it is said that
he will then take up these propositions
with Yard and definitely decide what
course will be taken by his -road in
Northern California.
A few days after this trip had been
made the surveying parties of the
Western Pacific, which had been called
in for the winter, were suddenly or
dered out again and arrangements
irade at Chico. Susnnville and other
points for providing the men with pro
visions for the balance of the winter.
Those men are now working along Deer
Creek Canyon, a fact which is accepted
as an indication that a change in the;
plans of the Western Pacific has been
made in so far as an outlet from the
State is concerned.
When this party arrived at the va
rious towns the people who had learned
to regard the Western Pacific and
Butto and Plumas roads as rivals were
surprised to discover H. H. Yard at the
bead of the party that was supposed
to be distinctively a Bartnett repre
sentation. Yard and Chief Engineer
Dillman of the Western Pacific made a
tour of the entire length of the Feather
River through which the two lines are
expected to extend and finally arrived
at Susanville, where they held a long
conference.
The first intimation that those ivho
have been watching the movements of
thÂ«Â» two companies received of any pos
sible combination between Bartnett
and Yard was about two weeks ago.
Several weeks ago TTartnett left for the.
Kast and Bhortly after a hurried sum
mons startec] Yard off in the same di
rection. Whether th*Â» two men met in
Nov.' York or elsewhere in the East is
not known, but this much is: that
Yard returned three weeks ago as sud
denly as he left. Two days after his
return messages were sent north Â±o
hotel men along the lines of the two
roads that a party of Western Pacific
men were bound .north and would need
accommodations for about twelve.
â¢COXFKItEXCK FOLLOWS.
JL was announced some time ago
that the Western Pacific road would
leave the State by way of the Beckwith
Pass, but hardly had this news been
given out before th? surveyors of the
company were discovered at Susanville.
busily surveying another way out of
the State. When they reached that
town the Yard men were already at
work. At no time has Yard admitted
that his rÂ«ad is any part of a transcon
tinental enterprise, his claim being that
ho is building a local road, with the
timber tracts in Northern California as
its ultimate destination. It is -appar
ent, however, that the Western Pacific
people were inclined to be a bit dubknis
concerning his stated plans, for they
have endeavored in every possible man
ner, to anticipate his movements. *
III'RKIICD EASTERN TRIPS.
Humors of a consolidation of the two
railroad interests which have for over
a year been surveying routes from Oro
ville along the Feather River and over
toward the eastern line of the State
are interesting local railroad circles.
In connection with this rumor comes a
report that Attorney W. J. Bartnett,
representing one, the Western Pacific,
and H. H. Yard, the other, known as
the Butte and Plumas Railroad, are
quietly dickering toward that end.
Yard, behind whom is said to be a
heavily capitalized Philadelphia syn
dicate, was the first to begin opera
lions at Oroville and along the Feather
River nnd had mado much progress in
his mysterious railroad project when
the other equally mysterious enterprise
started Its surveyors at work to find a
suitable outlet for a line of tracks by
way of th<Â» rivpr. . Both corporations
have been spending money liberally in
the pursuit of their respective objects,
but it has been conceded by practical
railroad builders that the Yard outfit
was making., better headway up
through the State and gaining a route
superior to that of the company that
has been operating parallel with it.
FORT WAYNE, Ind., Dec. 29.âLim
ited train No. 5. westbound, on the

Elmer Stafford of the limited was also
seriously injured. Three porters and
H. C. Suttler of Norfolk, Neb., and I.

of track near where ,tne wreck occur
red the limited was running at a very
moderate rate. Otherwise it would
have been running at a terrific speed,
as it was behind time.

EDUCATORS' VIEWS.
The session was opened v. ith solos
by Miss Helen Crane, accompanied by
Miss Ethelwyn Mnrrack end Mrs. Mary
McGlade. The first topic to be dis
cussed was reading in the elementary
schools. This subject was ably handled
by S. .H. Clark of the University of
Chicago. He illustrated how the sense
of the best classical writers could be
lost and the beauty of sentiment de
stroyed by poor enunciation. Professor
Clark made his points clearer by quot
ing familiar passages of prose and
poetry and by imitation showing the
fallacy of common bombastic declama
tion and the beauty of a clear, whole
some utterance of tho words.
Next In order were solos by Mrs.
Charles C. Hughes of Alameda and
Miss Anna Hadfell, accompanied by
Miss Bliven. The music made a very
pleasant break and the soloists were
heartily . applauded.

Judge Burnett of Santa Rosa, who
was to have represented the bar, was
unable to be present and the conclud
ing address was made by Charles A.
Murdock on behalf of the business
man. His remarks were brief, but to
the point. He said that the teacher
and not the principals nor curriculum
make the school and give the boy a
chance to become a complete man and
the girl a complete -womanS He also
called attention to the lighting and
â¢ventilation in the schools, which hfc
characterized as ' nothing less than
criminal.
The County Boards of Education
also met In the high school building

result the committee will ask the opin

Interesting demonstrations in the in

also made. The amateur cooks in their

"The development of the children is
of the utmost importance, as they, in
the future, are to develop the state. I
would suggest to you what my ances
tors taught 1900 years agoâ that the
hands should be developed at the same
time as the brain. When a little one
becomes what 'we commonly miscall
mischievous his little hands should be
given some occupation. It is a sign of
a natural desire to be busy and should
not be frowned down. Another fault
among teachers is to impress their dig
nity too strongly upon their pupils.
They should instead put themselves in
the places of the pupils, try to feel as
a little child would, and by sympathy,
tenderness and kind treatment help it
Instead, of crush it. All children's
brains are not alike and All cannot be
treated alike, but the children of the
present are the men and women of the
future and should be treated accord
ingly."
"As for the moral side, being a cler
gyman, I suppose I should say some
thing, but there is no use reopening
old discussions. , It is my Opinion, how
ever, that the more Christian principles
a teacher Instills into her pupils the
better. I do not mean the reading of
the word of God nor the rules of any
particular sect. What a teacher should
do, though, i3 to live up to the rule:
"Do unto others as you would they
should do unto you." Teach this, and
the whole doctrine of Christianity to
pupils, without sectarianism, and we
will have better men and better wo
men." Â«

recognized by the teachers and they

When President Tompkins had con

pupils of the Denman Choral. The
girls of Mrs. M. M. Fitzgerald's class,
under the direction of Azro It. Mann,
principal of the Denman Grammar
School, rendered "Night in May." by

"Pilgrim's Chorus" (Wagner). and "The

GUT FOLLOWS REPORTS.
The treasurer's report showed the
total funds of the association to be
$15,450 77, with a net gain of $1448 41
for 1903. The benefit committee report

The transportation and advisory
committee reported that but few com
plaints had needed adjustment. The
relief committee's report showed that
it had not been asked to give relief to
more than three members, the total
expenditure for that purpose being
$80 90. The report of the headquart
ers committee proved that the year
had been very prosperous. "The Of
ficial Bulletin" was shown to be in a
successful condition.
Numerous additions to the constitu

"There are 790 members in. good
standing. The list of suspended mem
bers during the year was much larger
than usual owing to the fact that dur
ing the busy i years of 1902 and 1903
travelers who had been for years on
the road were able to obtain inside sit
uations, and in consequence felt that
the association would be of no further
use to them. The retirement of so
many old timers brought a number of
young men on the road, wh.P, after a
year of probation was up, joined the
association only to be suspended^! ther
because they had lost their positions or
had been unable to stand the monthly
tax of 50 cents. The new membership
during the year \Yas 200 and 43 associ
ate members, making a total of 243 for
1903.
YOUNG MEN SUSPENDED.
"Honesty is tho best policy and when
traveling men will deal as honestly
with transportation companies as they
exact from all who trade with them,
then possibly the railroad companies
will be glad to simply issue a plain
card entitling commercial travelers to
all the rights and privileges of their
trains.
"The constitution and by-laws, ar
ticle 5, section 6. state positively that
the association shall not authorize the
use of its co-operative name, initials
or seal to any person as an indorse
ment for the sale of any merchandise.
â¢ "If any member offer for sale mer
chandise bearing the corporate name,
initial or seal, he shall be liable to ex

"Recently some members have en
deavored to place a bottled article on
the market and have been guilty of
bringing the name of the association
into the deal both by inference and
plain statement so as to procure greater
pressure on the buyer. This is against
the best interests of the association
and against the interests of members
who are handling a like product. If
this association permits any company
to use its influence In placing wares
of any kind on the market, it will es
tablish- a precedent that will entirely
disrupt the organization.
"One of the greatest accomplish
ments obtained by the association was
the defeat of a bill during the last
Legislature which, had It become a law,
would have deprived 25 per cent of
the traveling men of California of em
ployment and forced as great a per
centage of merchants of California out
of business.
Reports were heard which were in
every* sense gratifying to th rt members
and were accepted with acclamation.
President Davis in his annual report
had the following, among other things,
to relate for the information of his
associates:
"Non-members of the Pacific Coast
Commercial Travelers' Association
have been very prolific during the year
in their desire that the organization
should take up their fight In localities
where they have been imposed upon.
They have had no attention paid them,
as we are not a charity organization
nor a collection agency. If a travel
ing man will not spare the small sum
of 50 cents a month, the association's
dues, with few exceptions, he is either
a nickel-in-the-slot artist, a natural
born miser or a high-born aristocrat,
whose cowardly nature, in places where
he cannot be detected, scorns Joining
an association where religious lines are
not drawn. Such commercial travelers
hold their positions because they travel
for laborers' wages and small expenses.
HONESTY BEST POLICY.
A vote was then taken and resulted
in favor of establishing a free bed for
members in some reputable hospital.
The question of increased payment to
the secretary was also considered and
will be left to the directors to de
termine whether the monthly salary
shall be increased from $50 to $75 or
more.
FREE BED IX HOSPITAL. '
A meeting of the Pacific Coast Com
mercial Travelers' Association was held
yesterday in Elks Hall to hoar the an
nual reports and elect officers for the
ensuing year. The retiring president,
Robert H. Davis, was in the chair.
Not least In interest before the meet
ing was the subject of hotel accommo
dation and the, treatment accorded the
members by hotel proprietorc. There
was a discussion on this matter that
lasted for some time and in which
numerous members of the organiza
tion took a lively part.
There had been some complaints, said
President Davis, which had been aired
in the association's journal, the Official
Bulletin, but 'when the matter came
up for settlement or investigation the
complainant invariably withdrew and
in case of threatened action for libel
even evaded his responsibility.
S. Baruch was-foremost in the argu
ment and infqrmed( the members that
whenever a complaint was made by the
association as to treatment of membara
in hotels those that were responsible
for any shortcoming quickly came to
time and remedied defects ami the ins
attention /complained of.
Alfred A. Kelly brought inn matter
to a vote 'arid it was determined that
after refusal or neglect of an offending
hotel proprietor to remedy Â«<vil3 the
board of directors shall advise the
members through the columns of the
Official Bulletin, publishing all reports
and correspondence pertaining thereto.
The proposal to give a salary to fu
ture presidents was taken up and it
was shown that that officer was de
serving of some consideration since
the office was one that" demanded an
outlay. The matter will come before
the new board of directors for final
decision. . .

In defending Legarda, a Filipino lawmaker accused
of grave immoralities, General Smith, a member of the
Philippine Commission, says that in morals Legarda
compares favorably with the American statesmen, al
though the Filipino conception of morals is admittedly
inferior to the American standard. All of which indi
cates that the Smith opinion of the morals of American
statesmen is that they certainly are no better than
those of the Filipino, and may be worse.
THE BROKEN TRUSTS.
Before turning to the course of
study -which Is to leave the instruction
book behind, however, I wish to
epeak a little of phrasing. As the
pupil advances he will notice occa
sional curving lines, sometimes above,
sometimes below the staff, and often

with each hand separately, then put
the parts together. This is a good rule
to observe in the future, as wett as at
the present time. When learning a
of music the pupil should first
read it through as it is written with
both hands to get a sort of synopsis
of the whole thing, as it were; then,
picking it to pieces, practice the two
parts separately, working out the most
difficult spots first before the more
simple ones.

pupil to take up in conjunction with,

The Russian Soldier.
"The Russian soldier, as I saw him
during the Boxer campaign, impressed
me as being a fatalist of a very prac
tical order." writes O. K. Davis In
Everybody's Magazine. "If it is his
time to lose his life he will lose it, and
there is little use in trying to save It..
He might as well go to one place as
another, and It makes no difference
whether he goes into a fight or keeps
out of it. He travels the line of least
resistance, and from this develops a
blind but often unintelligent obedience.
That sort of man makes a dangerous
fighting machine.

Lord Curzon has been long. noted for

who tells the story. Lord Curzon came
down from London by what was then
the Lon^dn, Chatham and Dover Rail

one o* the Kent coast resorts. Lord
Curzon was in a hurry. The train made
its twenty miles an hour all right, but
the future Viceroy thought it the slow
est train on earth. He said so to the
guard. That dignitary, as usual, took
the remark as a person insult.
"If you don't like the speed of thi3

ually up the scale, until he reaches the
first ledger line above the staff. He
will find that the note to be- placed on
this line is C â none other, in fact, than
the middle C in a different fcrm.
It may be difficult for him at first to
realize that the note on the first ledger
line below the staff in the upper clef
is the same' note as that on the first
ledger line above the staff in the- bass
clef, but if he looks through the first
pages of his "Practical Method" he
will find examples there given which
â¢will assist him in comprehending the
matter.
The bass clefts always a sticking
point witty little pupils, and it will be
â¢well to give the child plenty of exer
cise in writing the notes contained
therein, that he may become perfectly
famiCar with them at once, and so
avVid confusing the two clefs. Let him
write the notes backward and forward,
skipping around, and in every way
imaginable, until he cannot rr.iss them.
Then let him turn to his instruction
book and name any note you iiay point
to at randnm, first in one clef and then
in the other, until you are satisfied that
he holds both clearly and distinctly in
his mind. When this is accomplished
he has passed a very important mile
stone on his Journey.
Now, taking it for granted ihat the
pupil has studied faithfully all the ex
ercises and themes in his book written
in the upper clef he must tako up the

are united. This ire must practice in
exactly the fame manner that he did

ONCE more the Interstate Commerce Commission
submits to Congress a report dealing more
with the difficulties in the way of enforcing the
law than with the successes attained under it. The com
mission finds that no matter how earnestly it seeks to
enforce the law the railway companies find always some
means of evading it. It appears that nothing less than
power to deal summarily with guilty parties will ever
enable the commission to put a stop to the practice of the
companies of giving special privileges to certain ship
pers at the expense of others.
The commission says: "Tariffs as published and
filed are now generally observed, but in some cases the
tariffs themselves are so framed and contain such pro
visions as to permit preferences without departing from
their terms." In addition to the chances thus afforded of
continuing the evil practice of granting discriminating
rates, the new Elkins law, which was designed to put an
end to such favoritism, has had the effect of increasing
railway charges, and thus, as the report says, ''has oper
ated to intensify whatever was wrong iu the tariffs
themselves." Thus while the law has been' beneficial in
some respects, it is still far short of what is required.
As an illustration of the methods by which the rail
roads continue to grant rebates to favored parties with
out violating the law, the report gives the following case:
"The salt industry in Kansas is carried on by the Hutch
inson-Kansas Salt Company, popularly known as the
combine or trust, and by independent operators. It
was indicated by testimony that salt rates from Hutch
inson, Kans., and similar territory to the Missouri River
were not generally maintained previous to the spring of
1902, but since that time the rates named in the tariffs
have been charged. The Santa Fe, Missouri Pacific and
Rock Island systems, all having lines leading from
Hutchinson, made joint tariffs with the Hutchinson and
Arkansas River Railroad Company covering the trans
portation of salt to Missouri River points, and some of
the tariffs applied to other points as well. This Hutch
inson and Arkansas River Railroad Company, while in
corporated, does not operate any railroad or own any
equipment, but it does own some switch tracks or sid
ings adjacent to what is known as the Morton Mill,-6wned
by the Kansas Salt Company. This railroad company
received under the joint tariffs 25 per cent of the rates,
but not exceeding 50 cents per ton. The persons who
control this railway company are those in control of the
so-called salt trust, and they receive the benefit of the
division accorded to the Hutchinson and Arkansas River
Railroad Company. It was testified that 50 cents a ton
represented a fair profit to the producer, and that the
trust "was selling salt under contract at the Missouri
River at a price with which the independent operators
could not compete. This price drove the independent
operator out of that business, and it would not have been
made had not this division been given to the Hutchinson
and Arkansas River Railroad Company."
The report goes on to say, "There is reason to be
lieve that devices of this nature are frequently resorted
to." An amendment to the law is therefore imperative
unless it be the intention of Congress to leave the com
mission powerless against unscrupulous corporations.
The issue is to be met by Congress, for, as the commis
sion says, "Iivprevious reports the commission has care
fully pointed out the amendments deemed essential and
explained in detail the reason for its recommendations,
and it is unable to add anything of value to the presen
tation heretofore made> Its duty in this regard has been
performed."
INTERSTATE COMMERCE.
the smooth notes, that have preceded
it. Now is the time to make use of
the "technique" so faithfully practiced
during the first lessons, and which I
hope has been kept up until the pres
ent time with no cessation of enthus
iasm.
The beginning of a phrase is invari
ably attacked with the "down-arm
motion." Now, however, all the mo
tions are to be taken in a less exag
gerated form than they were in the
exercises; and while the pupil is, in
reality, using exactly the same mo
tions thai he was while practicing the
exercises, he must gradually tone down
the sweep of his arm (whether up or
down, as the case may be) until it sug
gests no exaggerated motion to the ob
server. The deeper a chord is intend
ed to be, .the higher the arm must be
raised, preparatory to falling in the
"down-arm motion." The same rule
applies, inversely, to the chord (or
note, as the case may be) at the end,
of the phrase. The more importance
there is to be given to the final chord
the higher must the arm rise, as the
fingers leave the keys in the "up-arm
motion." The notes intervening be
tween the beginning and end of a
phrase are presumably legato notes,
to Â»je played as are the notes in scale
practice, i.- e. t with a smooth, singing,
connected tone, whether fast or slow.
After the next to the last note is
struck, the hand (while the finger is
still on the note) drops to allow full
swing when it rises again in obedience
to the "up-arm motion."
It will be found of great benefit to
the pupil if at this point he takes up
an exercise which is intended to facili
tate this. Let him strike C with his
second finger with the "down-arm mo
tion," but Instead of allowing his arm
to remain down, he must start it up
ward again, at the same time striking
D with his third finger in the manner
demanded by the "up-arm motion."
He thus combines the two motions in
one exercise, in which is contained the
principle of attacking and leaving a
phrase. There may be two notes or
twenty in a phrase. It makes no dif
ference with regard to a principle.
The intervening notes call forth simple
finger motions only, with no complica
tion of arm or wrist.
When this is once understood the
pupil cannot go wrong In the matter,
and with a little practice it will become
instinct with him to attack and leave a
phrase in the proper way without hav
ing to give the matter a conscious
thought.
" Very staccato notes are indicated by
large, pear-shaped dots, and mean that
the finger must be withdrawn entirely
from the key, as soon as possible, after
the note is struck.
The other simpler marks of phrasing,
such, for example, as the opening an
gle, intended to denote an increase in
volume, and the closing angle, denoting
a diminution of sound, are all fully ex
plained in the instruction book, and
need no further notice from me.
Also, the meanings of the Italian
words scattered through al: ost any
piece of music are to be found in any
dictionary of musical terms. It would
be impossible to explain them all here,
and it is quite unnecessary, as it is a
simple matter for any student to look
them up, as he has need. for them. See
that he does look them up, however.
As the pupil's musical horizon en
larges he will have more and more oc
casion to use the whole of the keyboard
(Instead of being confined to a few
notes above and below middle C as at
first), consequently it will often happen
that his music will require him to carry
bis* hands and arms quickly from one
end of the piano to the other. When
this occurs he must not fail to facilitate
matters by the use of the "water mo
tion." whether the space to be trav
ersed be three octaves or one only. This
motion, like all the others, must no
longer* be exaggerated, but must be
"toned down,'.' and must merge into the
"down-arm" motion if It occurs in go
ing from one phrase to another. It
serves, as it were, the purpose of a
bridge to connect two phrases or to
connect two notes that are far removed
from each other.
The wrist! motion, too, must come
into constant use in ordinary chords, in
very staccato notes and in all places
that do not call for arm motions.
It Is all much more simple than It
sounds, and the pupil will fall into the
habit of using the motions at the
proper time without the slightest ef
fort, after a very little practice; and
finding the great variation of tone to.be
brought out by this means, he will
eoon unconsciously call to his aid what
ever motion will best interpret the
musio before him.
Backsliders.
The agents of a Kentucky distillery
in this city have been forwarding to
grocers throughc-ut the State printed
forms to be filled up with the names
of customers who might be induced to
purchase a supply of the whisky at re
duced rates. They promise a commis
sion on all sales effected in that way.
A story is going the rounds that a
grocer in a town in the interior where
a good number of prohibitionists live
thought it would be a good joke to fill
in the names of as many prohibition
ists as he could remember. He did so
and thought no more about the matter.
That was about four months ago, and
the grocer was staggered the other day
when he received a draft for $33 as
commission on the sales effected
through hls-recommendation. The joke
was too good to keep, and when the
story got talked about in the town
there was great consternation among
the prohibitionists. All attempts to dis
cover the backsliders have, it. is said,
failed, the grocer refusing to throw any
light on the subject.
BOTH CLEFS TOGETHER.

one's neighbors displaying excited distrust of one at

Glaciers Fading.
The French Alpine Club appointed a
committee of scientific 'men two yeafrs
ago to collect annually the results of
all the studies of glaciers made in
every part of the world and to prepare
a yearly report. The s'econd report,
covering 1902, just issue*!. presents a
large amount of evidence to show that
throughout the world the great ma
jority of glaciers are manifesting a
constant tendency to diminish in area.
Their lower ends are slowly retreat
ing farther up the mountains. There
are exceptions to this rule in small dis
tricts, but these exceptions only em
phasize the prevailing tendency every
where, from the Arctic to the Antarctio
zones.
In the Alps, for example, the diminu
tion of glaciation is everywhere notice
able, excepting in the Oriental Alps,
where the glaciers are now a little
longer and thicker than they were at
the beginning of the century. Through
out the Cordilleras of the Andes the
glaciers are retreating.

The Fall.
He was a new reporter on the police
assignment. He was fresh from an
eastern metropolis, full of brave ideas
about the way news should be gath
ered, a bit bumptious and a trifle con
ceited. He grated on the old stagers,
so they decided to initiate him. This
is the way they told the story at the
Press Club:
"One of the gang received a cooked
up message over the 'phone in the re
porters' room: 'Riot in the Presidio.
Dozen soldiers killed. Big story; get
out on it.'
"And 'out on if rushed the gang,
our friend from the East following,
pop-eyed with excitement. We ran
one way. He jumped across the street
for the nearest hack. It was then 11:30
p. m.
"At 3 o'clock the "late watch* man on
a certain morning newspaper answered
a telephone call:
" 'This is Blank at the Presidio. I've
been hiking since midnight on that riot
story, but not a soldier nor an officer,
from the commandant down, knows
anything. What shall I do?'
" 'Do? Do nothing. You've been
jobbed. Paper's gone to press long
ago,' was the cold-blooded reply.
"Blank found his way,, back to town.
The next night there was an air of
subdued quiet about the new man. He
hasn't offered any more suggestions
about eastern newspaper methods. And
it is said he didn't turn in an %S hack
bill in his expense account that Â¦week."
IF reports from Southeastern Russia are not exagger
ated, more mafcsacres of the Jews are due about old
Christmas. The selection of the Christmas day of the'
Greek church as an occasion for murder makes it clear
that the anti-Semite agitators depend upon the religious
fanaticism of the people as the motive for the abhorrent
crimes which they incite.
In past ages other branches of the Christian church
have depended upon the same motive for bloody assaults
upon each other, and in the result every instinct of
humanity and every precept of Christianity were out
raged. But we live now in a different world. Even at
Rome the Ghetto is no more, and at Frankfort the Jews,
once the slaves of the city, are now its masters. Only in
Russia is it possible, by official connivance and ap
proval, to indulge in wholesale murder with difference of
faith as its excuse. Even in Turkey the quarrels which
embroil Christians and Mahometans have a distinctly
political origin, and are merely embittered by religious
differences as a secondary influence.
Christendom owes a duty to the Russian Jews. The
question is, how shall it be discharged? No doubt the
widespread protest against the massacre of last year im
pelled the Czar to inflict such punishment as was visited
upon the bloody wretches who committed the crime.
With that experience fresh in his memory," it may be that
the protesting sentiment of the world, which has been
evoked by the current threat of more murders, will
cause such precautions as will prevent another outbreak.
But Russia, in her operations in Eastern Asia, has shown
such disregard for the opinions of mankind that she may
be equally impervious to, influence affecting her domestic
policy and disorders.
One thing "should be sure. If she press her Eastern
conflict to a war with Japan, there may be furnished the
most interesting situation that history has ever re
corded. In such a war not the nations as governments,
but Christendom as one of the moral grand divisions of
mankind, would be on the side of Japan, a Buddhist
power, because of sympathy for the J*ews. Out of great
evil great good is possible, and the mind cannot imagine
anything that would so much glorify the brotherhood of
man as that spectacle.
There is one element of safety for the Russian Jews
that has not been taken into sufficient account. Russia
cannot carry out her vast policy of aggression in the
East without borrowing great sums of money, and she
cannot borrow without the consent of the Jews, who con
trol the floating capital of Europe. The man who called
Rothschild "the Jew of the kings" uttered something
more than a witticism. The Rothschilds and the great
Jew bankers of Europe are a more potent influence for
peace than the Hague court. It is the fact that no nation
can float its war bonds in Europe unless the Jews un
derwrite the loan. In such a situation Russia may be
compelled to elect between the luxury of murdering
Jews on the day of the nativity^ of the Prince of Peace
and her ambitious schemes of aggression and expansion
in Eastern Asia.
The calls upon the Government of the United States
for interference have been renewed. In considering
them it is well to have an eye to past precedents. The
opinion is propagated that the action of the President is
necesary to make any protest effective. . In the case of
the Hungarians, and in other instances, the action exr
pressive of sympathy has been taken by Congress, and
the Executive has been left free for obvious reasons. If
we are prepared to make the abuse of her Jews a casus
belli against Russia, and our people desire a declaration
of war to follow rejection of our demand for mercy, the
case is different. If that is the wish of the American
people, it must be considered, also, that such a declara
tion of war would be instantly followed by the murder
of every Jew in Russia. ' .-â¢ j
Would that result bring continental Europe into alli
ance against Russia? With another Bonaparte in lead,
this might be the result, for Napoleon would have in
stantly seen the vast political 'advantage of such a situa
tion. Had it occurred in his day the French would not
have been alone at Moscow, and his dream of breaking
Muscovite power and confining Russia beyond- the
Dneiper would have become actuality. , In view of these
considerations it may well be that the, safety of the Rus
sian Jews is best assured by exceeding diplomatic action.
The obvious purpose of American politicians to make
domestic politics out of it should be looked upon with
suspicion. American Jews are among our most influen
tial and most respected citizens. They know that Amer
ican sympathy does not depend upon the pyrotechnic
pretense of American politicians. If these American
Jews consult together and, acting as ArheriAns, advise a
policy to be followed by the United States, it will be
sure to be wise, prudent and effective, and American
public opinion will instantly back it up and enforce it.
Such Jews are perfectly well aware that the artificial
sympathy pretended by an enemy of law and order, an
enemy of the President, and the adviser of assassination
in his own country, has a purpose which uses the Rus
sian situation as a pretext only. In the matter of the
Jewish petition to Russia the President was guided by
the wisdom of Jews who were not infatuated by praise
of themselves, and that he and the- country will heed
such wisdom again there is no doubt. v

tioned, and they turn to the Democracy for hope and
comfort in their purpose to defeat him.
It is amusing to watch the wind blow, just now, in
politics. As the trust rage rises, Mr. William Randolph
Hearst makes his bow to an audience that is in dreadful
fear of the penitentiary, and says, "Gentlemen, my own
wealth should assure you that when I am President
money will talk to a friend in the White House." A goat
on a picket fence could not balance more evenly between
blue grass on one side and a mess of tomato cans on the
other than he does between labor and capital. But the
people are not panting for an equilibrist. They want a
man of direction and not indirection, and looking upon
the work of the President they find there firmness of
purpose and frankness of expression, and they will get
their vaudeville from Mr. Hearst and their valor from
Roosevelt.

Soimdins the Heart.
Dr. Gustavus Gartner, professor of
pathology at the Vienna University,
has made an important discovery of a
method for examining the heart. He
is the first to succeed in determining
the pressure of blood in the right auri
cle and the right ventricle, into which
the whole of the venous blood flows be
fore passing into the vessels of the
lungs for purification. His method 13
based on the following principles: If
one lowers his arm the veins in the
hand fill with blood, as is very plainly
seen on the back of the hand. If one
raises one's arm above the head the
veins collapse again. By exact and mi
nute observation Dr. Gartner has suc
ceeded in determining the height at
which the veins of the hand collapse or
fill in most cases. This change is so
distinct as to form a basis for measure
ments. The experiments have been
made on healthy and sick persons.
When the pressure of the blood in the
heart is normal the raising of the hand
to the height of the right chambers â
the position of which can be ascer
tained by percussion or Roentgen rays
â suffices to make the veins in the back
of tfce hand disappear. Dr. Gartner can
now measure the differences In the
pressure between the right chambers
and the veins direct, and, by observing
the veins in .the back of the hand, he
can draw trustworthy conclusions as to
the state of the heart. â New York Com

Suits "for divorce were filed yesterday
as follows: Theresa A. Hoppe against

Suit for annulment of marriage was
instituted by John P. Burke against
Laura E. Burke.
Marguerite Mackintosh was granted
a divorce from Charles J. Mackintosh
in Judge Hebbard's court yesterday.
The ground on .which the degree was
granted was extreme cruelty. Mrs.
Mackintosh was formerly a Miss Hecht
of San Jose. In May. 1902, the young
woman took passage on a steamer from
this port for Nome, where she was to
Join her mother.
While aboard the steamer she fell in
love with Mackintosh, who was then
chief engineer. The couple got off the
ship at Seattle and were married. Four
months later Mrs. Mackintosh left her
husband In this city and went to live
wit,h her mother. She claimed that he
had treated her cruelly. He had an
ungovernable temper, she said, and in
sisted on sleeping with a loaded rifle
under his pillow, with which on sev
eral occasions he threatened to kill her.
Mackintosh made several Ineffectual at
tempts to get his wife to return to
him by threatening to kill her, but was
unsuccessful.
When the suit for divorce was filed
he made known his conclusion to fight
the case vigorously and said that he
would never pay any alimony. The
case was finally settled out of court
by Mackintosh paying his wife $1000
and the decree was obtained without
any contest on his part. Macintosh is
at present chief engineer of the ferry
boat San Jose.
Interlocutory degrees were granted to
the folio-wing named yesterday: Charles
A. Serin from Louise Serin for infidel
ity, James H. Lynden from Florence
M. Lynden for desertion, Alfred H.
Coates from Emma C. Coates for de
sertion, Lillian A. Harron from Ralph
A. Harron for failure to provide, Ame
lia McMinn from Joseph McMinn for
desertion.
DENVER. Colo., 'Dec. 29. â Dr. Seymour T.

house yesterday, was somewhat Improved to

turned.
LONDON, Doc. 2?.â The Most Rev.
Francis Bourn* 5 , Roman Catholic Arch
bishop of Westminster, was enthroned
in the new Cathedral of Westminster
to-<Jay with the impressive ceremony
incidental to such occasions. The vast
building was filled to its capacity by
ecclesiastics and laymen of the Roman
Catholic church, the robes of the of
liciating clergymen and the varied
garbs of the numerous religious orders
forming a conspicuous contrast with
the brick walls and bare-looking, un
finished edifice.
The Cathedral of Westminster, con
secrated to-day, is the first Roman
Catholic cathedral that has stood in
the metropolitan section of England
since the Reformation. The building
was begun only eight, years ago,
though it was projected by Cardinal
Wiseman (who died in 1865), and waa
planned by Cardinal Manning. It is
eituated half a mile west of West
minster Abbey, and is a magnificent
structure of Byzantine style, with
a groat campanile of red brick, band
ed with Portland stone, standing 300
feet high and .crowned with a metal
covered dome surmounted by a double
cross ot bronze.
The extreme length of the new ca
thedral outside is 360 feet; width, 156
feet; height of nave, 117 feet; and it
covers an area of about &4.000 square
feet.
The general view of the inner walls
is still one of bai-e, rough brick.
The scheme is to cover the whole of
ftie lower walls and the piers to the
height of about forty feet with marble.
All the upper part and the vaults and
concrete domes will be decorated with
Mosaic work, illustrating the history
of the church.
The total subscription before the
laying of the foundation stone was
"more than $250,000. Since then there
have bo^n many large individual bene
factions, and the total expenditure on
the entire edifice up to the end of Octo
ber was more than a million dollars.
The cathedral stands clear of debt.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 29.â The
correspondent of a Russian news
aprncy at Kishinev telecraphs a de
nial of the statement that the Jewish
population *s being pillaged by the Rus
sians.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29.â Ai the in
stance of President Roosevelt, who has
interested himself in the" reports from
abroad of massacres and contemplated
massacres of Jews in Kishenev, the
State Department is making active in
quiry through its diplomatic, and con
sular offices with the view to ascer
taining the exact situation as affecting
these people. The United States .con
sular agent at Odessa already has been
heard from* and he cabled the State
Department to-day that there had been
no fresh outbreak at Kishenev,' as re
ported -
Simon Wolf, representing the B'nai
E'sith, and Adulphus H. Solomons of
New York, one of the trustees of the
Baron de Hii>ch* fund, held a confer
ence with acting Secretary Lootnis to
day, during which the subject of the
Jcveu in Russia was discussed. Loomis
* showed *ht^m the Odessa dispatch,
v/hieh pave them some feeling of relief.
They did not present a petition and
"".-ill not do so ur.Jess later information
proves the situation to be as serious
as reported. Wolf said that he had
been impelled to call at the department
cz account of -the meeting which re
cently was held in England, over which
Lord Rothschild presided, which, he
said, pave the matter a character of
seriousness which otherwise might not
have been accepted.
Simon Wolf endeavored to have an
audience wiih Baron Sternberg, the
German Embassador, to-day, but with
out avail. Tho Embassador was not at
home io Wolf when the latter called
at the embassy, and had Baron von
Bussche Haddenhausen. the first sec
retary ard counselor, see him. Wolf
informed Baron BusÂ«;he that he came
primarily in the interest of a client Vho
had .lone some legal work for the em
bassy ar.d was now in trouble. Wolf
improved the opportunity, however, to
eay that he was interested in the Kishe
nev agitation in this country and had
an appointment to see the President on
the subject to-day. Wolf made no
rropoFition to Baron Bussche touching
the implication erf the embassy in the
troubles of the Jews.
Wo)f and Solomon later called at the
White House, but did not see the Presi
dent. Thev were informed that the
PrÂ«;!v5_'nt had anticipated their mission
by rfauesting the Gtate Department to
inquire through its c<-msular offices In
thf Ktsheaev district as to the reported
condition there.
Sensational developments are prom
ised in the divorce suit of E. K. Clarke,
who has instituted proceedings to an
nul his secret marriage to Mrs. Rosa
lind Bower, widely ' known as the
"Sweet Pea Girl," in Oakland several
weeks ago. Since his action was filed
against his wife Clarke has had detec
tives employed in gathering evi
dence that will support the claim set
forth In his suit that his marriage was
the result of a conspiracy in which a
number of persons, including the pro
prietress and female denizens of the
house in which he first met Mrs. Bower,
were Involved.
It is claimed by those that are in
terested in Clarke's side of the divorce
proceedings that testimony will be In
troduced at the hearing of the case to
show I that the women companions of
Mrs. Bower supposed that the plaintiff
was a son of United States Senator
Clark and that they proceeded with
their Dipt to marry him to the defend
ant with the idea that it would be a
profitable undertaking not only for
Mrs. Bower, but those who helped her
along with her matrimonial project.
According to the stories of Clarke's
friends, the first intimation that the
women received of the fact that he
was not a member c* the Senator's
family was when the news of the mar
riage was published the following
morning and gave the residence and
names of the relatives of the husband.
These facts, it is said, have already
been admitted by several of the women
of the house In which the plot is said
to have originated and it is expected
that these women will so testify when
they are called as witnesses. The son
of Senator Clark, for whom the women
mistook E. K. Clarke, was at the time
and still is in Montana.
Mrs. E. K. Clarke is expected to file
her answer to her husband's suit in a
few days. Yesterday it we s stated by
one of the husband's . friends that
Clarke is determir.d to prosecute the
case to the end and will not entertain
any proposition toward a compromise.
At the same time it was admitted that
the wife had made no attempt to effect
a compromise.

Where is he who hath the hardihood
to affirm that women don't know a Joke
when they see one? That fellow should
have been forcibly haled before the
California Club yesterday to hear the
clever satire written by a member and
produced by members, and then been
bidden to forever hold his peace. And
that satire satirized the very members
of the club. Now, what cleverer thing
than that could a man's club do? And
no one got mad, either.
The play was written by Miss Ruth
Comfort Mitchell to celebrate the sixth
birthday of the club, and the parts
were cleverly taken by Mrs. Arthur
Cornwall, Miss Susanne Patch, Miss
Laura Musto, Mrs. Horace Coffin, Mrs.
W. I. Marion, Mrs. Emil Pohli. Miss
Emilie Kalisher'and Miss Rodney Ken
drick.
Now, of that bright galaxy of stars
Mrs. Cornwall as the clinging, confid
ing wife, and Miss Susanne Patch as
the little but mighty husband "made
good" â as the actors say â in a way that
made glad the hearts of those who were
lucky eneugh to be there.
The programme opened with an ad
dress of the founders by Mrs. J. J.
Scoville, after which the play that has
been practiced in star chamber session
for weeks became a thing of publicity.
Miss Patch, whose tiny frame fitted
deftly into a boy's frock coat, assumed
astonishing dignity by the annexation
of a pair of Dundreary whiskers and
a pompous wig; he was loved "horri
bly" (as the smart set say) by his wife,
who was impersonated by Mrs. Corn
wall. Now Mrs. Cornwall has never
been classed among the fragile mem
bers of the club and in her clinging
gown and stunning hat looked as
though she might put "Alpheus" in her
hip pocket. But she didn't. She loved
Alpheus dearly and leaned on him fig
urativelyâyes, and literally. Poor Al
pheus! Alpheus didn't believe in suf
frage; neither did she, because he
didn't.
So proud of Alpheus was his Miner
van mate that she loved to hear him
recits "that dainty little poem that
Uncle George Bromley renders so
touchingly, 'Jingle, Jangle, When the
Cows Come Home.' "
Mrs. Rodney Kendrick was the lady
with a bill to get through. Her bill
was a measure for the protection of
larks. She had interviews with several
solons of Sacramento in regard to it,
and among them Senator Shortridge
declared outright in favor of the meas
ureâbecause he liked "larks;" and the
bill became a law, reading "Farmers
are henceforth compelled to plant such
seeds as- will agree with larks."
This is but a sample of the satires
thrust upon the misguided efforts of
the women of the club, and they
brought a merry laugh from those they
hit the hardest.
The play over, the members ad
journed to the tea room, where dainty
tables were spread, and in quaffs of
thinner things than obtain in men's
clubs many merry toasts were given.
Mrs. George Law Smith, the charming
hostess of the day, replied to the toast,
"The Founders." In it she congratu
lated the twenty-seven ladies with pos
sessing the prolific progeny of 450. Mrs.
Aaron Schloss responded to "Our Pres
ident;" Mrs. Hertz, "The Press;" Dr.
Minerva Kibbe, "Our Husbands;" Mrs.
Madden, "The Play and Players;" Mrs.
Mariner Campbell, "Music;" Mrs. J.
W. Orr. "Ourselves."
Mrs. Bates covered herself with glory
as toastrmstress, contributing much to
the programme by her clever repartee.
Altogether the affair stands pre-emi
nently the finest thing ever done by the
California Club, and in consequence a
love feast fittingly followed.
The play thtt Mr. and Mrs. de Young
will produce on New Year's eve, "My
Colorado Belle," was rehearsed yester
day, and no cleverer vaudeville bill has
been seen here for many a moon. The
play has been built by Ernest S. Simp
son and Will Irwin, and architecturally
it is a gem. It surely is a pity .that
more of we mortals cannot see so clever
a lot of people in so clever a skit. Mrs.
Gerstle, Mrs. Jack Spreckels, Miss
Pearl Landers, Miss Ethel Hager, Will
Smith. Joseph Rosborough, Jack
Wilson, Addlson Mizner, Frank- Owen,
Charles de Young and his Harvard
chum, Charley Shea, are especially
good. Fischer would smile unctiously
had he as chipper a cast for his new
productions.

REGAL SHOES:
Tf we could make you realize the
plain truth about Regal shoes, we
would have to stop advertising and
build a row of new factories.
The trouble is that you have been paying $5, $6,
$8 or $14 a pair for shoes for so long that you can't
believe the best shoes possible to make out of leather
can be made, and are made, and sold for $3.50.
That's the plain," bald. fact, and Regal shoes will
prove it to yott if you give them a chance. When
we say " best," we mean best in style, in fit, in leather,
in workmanship, in wear. We have been saying
these things for 10 years. We started with a very
small business. Now we have 60 stores in all the
principal cities, and there are over 200,000 people on
our mail order books. That's a good endorsement
of what we say.
Why don't we sell all the shoes in the world?
We are sure we don't know. We ought to â and
There nro GO Regal stores, 20 of them In Greater New York, where the styles
originate. The new Htyles are on Sale at oar San Francisco store at the same time
as in the New York stores. . VV^vT

BOSTON. Dec. 29.â After a fifteen
round bout, during seven rounds of
which his opponent landed almost at
will, j Joe Watrott, the colored pugilist,
was given the decision over Larry
Temple <colored) of Stratford, Conn.,
before the Criterion Athletic Club to
night. Close work on the part of both
boxers marked the contest from the
first round, Walcott rushing in at
every opportunity, only to be heavily
countered and to find himself outclassed
at .infighting. In the third round Wal
cott scored a knockdown, which did
little damage. In the seventh round
Temple showed signs of weakening and
Walcott landed both rights and lefts
xepeatedly with telling effect, Temple
receiving severe punishment during
this and the succeeding, rounds.
Joe Walcott Defeats Temple.
Ellis street was Impassable last night
at 6 o'clock when the boxers weighed
In. Corbett was the first to put in an
appearance, arriving twenty minutes
ahead of the appointed time. It was
but the matter of a few moments for
him to doff his street clothes and to
step on the scales for a private weigh
ing. He was apparently a little anx
ious, although he said he left his quar
ters at the Ocean Beach weighing
nearly one pound under the stipulated
figure of 129 pounds.
He had hardly stepped off the scales
when Hanlon entered the room. The
two boys sat off in a corner with their
trainers. There was a discussion as to
when they would enter the ring and the
time was fixed for 9:45 p. m. Both
boxers apparently wanted to enjoy a
substantial dinner before entering the
ring for the added strength it would
give them.
As 6 o'clock approached- the boxers
made ready to weigh officially. Hanlon
was the first on the scales and when
the restraining weight was released the
bar remained stationary. Corbett then
stepped on the scales. The bar trem
bled, but did not raise.
After the boxers had donned their
street clothes Referee Eddie Graney
had a conference with them. He said
that in case it became necessary for
some one to toss up a sponge he would
recognize only Harry Tuthill In Cor
bett's corner arid Harry Foley in Han
lon's corner. Graney said any second
entering the ring during the progress
of the fight would be ejected from, the
building.

Hanlon recovered quickly en route
home and when he arrived there he
ran up the stairs and greeted his
mother and. sisters affectionately. At
the suggestion of his sister3 Eddie re
tired to his room, but not to sleep.
Many visitors, among them Referee
Graney, called and the little Califor
nian held a levee. He consumed largo
quantities of ict cream and discussed
the fight in all its bearings. He said
he was not suffering and would be
around town to-day.
Harry t Foley was ind'isnant at the
suggestion that he should have
thrown up the sponge before the ref
eree stopped the fight. He said he
did not do so bacause he knew Han
lon was not in danger of permanent
injury.

SAN MATEO, Dec. 29. â The Reds won
in the polo match to-day by a ecore of
7 to 5. E. E. Ezra of India/ appeared
on the field for the first time and proved
himself a very strong player, making
three of the five goals Bcored by the
Whites. The other two were made by
Dunphy, who, in the^ast period, ex
changed coats with L.2ra ajjd played
with the Whites, after haWng twice
ecored for the Reds in the preceding
periods. Duval scored three goals for
the Reds, Driscoll two and Carolan one.
The game wa^ even better than that
of Sunday, the vigorous sky strokes of
Ezra being a feature. In a confusion
of goals in the fourth period, Driscoll,
playing Red, carried the ball across the
field and scored goal for the Whites.
Discovering his error, he promptly re
peated the performance for his own
side. Following were the sides:
Reds â T. A. Driscoll, L.. McCreery, C.
R. Duval, C. Dunphy. Whitesâ R. M.
Tobin, F. J. Carolan, E. W. Howard,

Corbett is 0 the greatest little
fighter in the world and Eddie
. Ilanion the grittiest, gainest and
finest little fellow living. I ac
tually wept when I went over to Â¦
Eddie's corner when I stopped
the battle. I felt so sorry for his
sad plight that I kissed him on
the forehead. His seconds
should never have waited for me
to stop the contest; they should .
have thrown up the sponge. It
was the only humane thins to
do. I stopped the battle to pre
vent a fatality. Hanlon was in
distress and . incapable of pro
tecting himself. Had I been
called upon to give a decision at
any stage of the battle I would
have had to give it to Corbctt,
as lie did the cleanest work. No
one can accuse me of unfairness.
. I gave each lad a fair show nnd
the best man Avon. This fight
vindicates me for calling their
first battle a draw. Corbett won
oh his merits. Hanlon did his
best, but was up against a cham
pion. My only regret is that his
seconds did not throw up the
sponge. Hanlon begged me not
to stop the fight when he went
down in the sixteenth round.â

Otto Floto, sporting editor of the
Denver Post, had a seat close to Cor

Quite a delegation was on hand from
Portland, headed by Jack Grant. Others
in the "push" were Steve Peuter, Nate

Johnny Considine, a well-known Se
attle sporting and theatrical man, left

business and racing man, also helped
represent Seattle.
Oakland, the quiet suburban town
just^icross the bay on the further side
of Goat Island and the ferry slips, sent
over a noisy cluster of sports with
Harold Magill and J. Cal Ewing as
promoters. Billy DIxon and several
Supervisors Â¦were among the rank and
file that stood for MagiU's tip on the
little North Beach boxer. After the
fight the whole party embarked on a
scow and were due at the foot of
Broadway any time around 5 g. m.
The racetrack contingent turned out
in full force. "Plunger" J Joe Yeager
was reported to have wagered JSOOO on
the chances of Young Corbett. He un
doubtedly did, for placing this small
amount would unnerve him no more
than licking a postage stamp. Among

As in previous contests where a
championship was involved sporting
men from many different States were
assembled at the ringside. Among the
local ringgpers were men from every
walk in life, who gave fancy prices for
seats with reckless abandon. ' Many
who would pass a blind man thirty
times a day without thinking of drop
ping a nickel in his tin cup or else
would walk thirteen blocks to save
15 cents when purchasing a shirt,
howled themselves hoarse In $10 seats.
But that all comes under th3 head of
with a serious look on b's face. He
looked In splendid condition and when
asked how he felt he turned to the
newspaper men at the ringside and
said: "I never felt better in my life."
He subsequently changed his position
to the northwest corner and waited pa
tiently for Hanlon to put in an appear
ance.
Ten minutes later Hanlon came from
his dressing room and a tremendous
Fhout went up from the spectators.
"Cute" Eddie was followed by his sec
onds â Harry Foley. Fred Landers, Toby
Irwln and Ted Wolfe. He wore his pink
and green sweater and smiled broadly
at Corbett. Corbett sprang up and both
men met in the center of the ring and
shook hands.
Eddie Graney, the "little horseshoer,"
who refereed the battle, entered the
ring looking spick and span in a Tux
edo and a wide expanse of shirt bosom.
"Billy" Jordan took the gloves over
to Lieutenant of Police Kelly for in
spection and then handed a pair to each
of the fighters. Preparations for the
contest were then made. Announcer
Jordan presented Hanlon to the crowd
and there was a-great cheer for him.
Eddie had green trunks and wore & rib
boned belt around his waist. He look
ed in perfect Â¦"ondition. Jordan an
nounced Corbett as the "pride of Den
ver and the champion of the world,"
and there was more cheering.
Challenges were read from Terry Mc-
Govern, who expressed a willingness to
meet Hanlon, and from other lesser
lights willing to meet the victor.
"This will be a twenty-round *go, f "
yelled Jordan, "and they will fight
straight Marquis of Queensberry rules,
break by the order of the referee and
protect themselves in the breakaway.
Let *er ko!"
The bell clanged and the two feather
weights strode to the center of the ring,
and the fight was on.
YOUNQ CORBETT, THE WORLD'S FEATHER-WEIGHT CHAMPION BOXER,- WHO ABLY DEFENDED HIS TI
TLE LAST NIGHT IN- A DESPERATE SIXTEEN-ROUND BATTLE WITH EDDIE HANLON AT MECHAN
ICS' PAVILION, WHICH WAS FINALLY STOPPED BY REFEREE EDDIE GRANEY.
It was 9:30 o'clock when Corbett put
in an appearance. He was first to move
toward the ring and a hearty cheer
marked his progress. The little cham
pion was followed by Harry Tuthill,
Tim McGrath, Billy Otts and George
Sanfransen. He was attired in a blue
avid white sweater and wore bandages
on his hands. On entering the ring: he
took the northeast corner and sat there
BOXERS ENTER THE RING.
Round after round the two great lit
tle fighters stood in the center of the
ring like two monarchs of the forest
which had locked horns and were bat
tling tp the death. With heads to
gether they stood and tried all they
knew to land a decisive blow. Corbett
was much the cleverer of the pair and
his blows proved the more effective.
Hanlon showed marked improvement
over his previous fights and gave Cor
bett some unpleasant moments. In the
seventh round Hanlon caught Corbett
a right swing on the head. It was a
little pop blow, which seemed to have
no force, but Corbett went to the mat
on his back. He was up in an instant,
but the blow had apparently rattled
him. Hanlon saw this and went in to
take advantage of It, but the round
ended before he could accomplish any
thing.
Hanlon made his big tactical mistake
in the eighth round. He was compara
tively fresh, and, instead of rushing in
to take all possible advantage of Cor
bett's condition, he started slowly and
gave his opponent a needed chance to
collect his scattered senses. It was
thought he should have put his fortunes
to the test then and there, and what
the outcome would have been no one
can say.
Hanlon went down for the second
time in the sixteenth round and Referee
Graney then stopped the afTiir. Han
lon vomited blood when taken to his
corner and showed other signs of ex
treme physical distress. He was car
ried from the ring and was removed
at once to his home. He was badly
cut about the' face. It is doubtful if
he will ever be able to fngnge In an
other big battle.
Corbett showed neither cuts nor
bruises. His nose bled a little at times,
but this did not dlstaess him.
Corbett was merciful to his lion
hearted opponent and wanted the fight
stopped when he saw Hanlon was no
longer able to defend himself. The
spectators near Hanlon's corner urged
Harry Foley, his chief second, to toss
up the sponge. This was not done, the
Californian apparently hoping to land
one blow which might turn the tide of
battle in his favor.
HANLON KNOCKED DOWN.
Young Corbett of Denver successfully
defended his title of feather-weight
champion boxer oi.' the world in Me
chanics* Pavilion last night, stopping
Eddie Hanlon, the. challenger for the
title, in the sixteenth round of their
fight.
' Hanlon was not knocked â¢ out, but
Referee Eddie Graney humanely
stopped the contest when all .nance for
a victory for the Californian had van
ished. To have permitted It to go fur
ther was only courting a possible trag
edy. The fight will go down in ring
history as one of the most stubbornly
contested ever seen here between men
Qf any weight.
The spectators w*?o filled every nook
and cranny of the uig building did not
know which to admire most. Corbett's
cleverness and consummate skill as a
ring general or Hanlon's aggressiveness
and gameress. The Californian took
an incredible amount of punishment.
Corbett's blows seemed shot from a
rapid-fire gun and few of them missed
their mark. With all this- it was not
juntil the last three rounds that Harjon
Showed any signs of weakening.
''The blow 'which practically decided
the sensational contest was a wicked
right to the body which Hanlon re
ceived in the thirteenth round. Just
before this Corbett had unerringly
sent right and lef \o the head. These
staggered Hanlon and it was'then Cor
bett sent in his right. Behind it was
all the force the network of muscles in
his shoulders could develop. All the
fight seemed takei, out of Hanlon in
that instant and when he went to his
corner his sturdy legs were wobbly.
The minute's rest was all fÂ»o Bhort for
him to recuperate and there was a
strained look in his face.
Corbett caught him some Bharp jolts
to the head. To the surprise of the
spectators Hanlon landed two wild
swings to the head and staggered Cor
bett. The latter sent tvo lefts to the
'ead which knocked Hanlon down, for
the first time in his ring career.
Hanlon was groggy when he stood
up and Corbett went in to end mat
ters. He landed hard rights Â«o the
head repeatedly, forcing Harjon to the
ropes, where he stood absolutely de
fenseless. Corbett 'tried all the blows
he knew but the game and rugged
youth in front of him would not suc
cumb. Corbett did not want to punish
Hanlon unnecessarily and Jn the next
round he begged to have the unequal
contest stopped. He merely Jabbed
who was still flgt'Ttog back at
[every opportunity.

friends lost their money betting
on me. I dhl my best to win.
My condition was of the best.
The weight bothered me a little,
but not very greatly. Corbett is
the best man I ever fought, lie
cap punch awfully hard with
either hand. I proved to-night
that I am not a quitter. I did
not want the fight stopped, as I
always thought I had a chance.
Corbett fought faster and better
this time than at our former
meeting. The referee acted
squarely and I have nothing to
say. I was beaten and by a bet

SAN MATEO, Dec. 23. â The victory
of the Keds in the polo match to-day
by a score of 7 to 5 was as nothing to
the sensation furnished when Franci3
J. Carolan for the second time within
a week rode into Lawrence McCreery.
Both riders were in imminent danger
of being unseated.
The first incident of this sort was
during a practice game last v%eek and
was considered merely an awkward ac
cident. When it occurred aÂ«iain to
day McCreery evidently felt aggrieved
and shouted to Carolan:
"You're getting too fresh. Frank, and
if this continues I shall hold you to
account for it."
"You can hold me to account for it
now if you wish," ' Carolan shouted
back, protesting that It was an ac
cident, and adding after more crossfire:
â¢If I were trying to kill you I could
do it easily enough."
Both men were angry and their words
were easily heard across the "eld.

beautiful and the course in excellent
condition. Miss Drum, with a handi
cap of twelve strokes, won with a net

Hildebrar.d was set down for ten days
by Starter Holtman for pulling up Flea
after being practically left. Hildebrand
has been riding in good form and can
illy be spared, as good riders are scarce.
Flea is owned by Vic Gilbert, the em
ployer of Hildebrand. If the two-year
old is a bad actor, put him on the
schooling list and keep him there, but
why punish the rider? The penalty
looks unjust and excessive.
At a meeting held by the board of
stewards of the California Jockey Club
on Saturday evening the statement
made by Jockey Chandler that Caesar
foung asked him to place the mare
Eoiiic was heard. The stewards were
unanimous in their belief that it was
merely a conspiracy en the part of
Chandler ar.d his friends to break the
contract held on his services by Young,
and recommended to the Pacific Jockey
Club that the rider's license be revoked.
Jake Holtman states that the reports
_rom St. Lotjis thnt he had signed to
ytart there next summer for the new
I.'nion Jockey Club are a bit premature.
Jake saVE, thouph. that he wrote P. J.
Carmody, president of the new turf
association, that they could have his
cervices for the season of ninety days
for $10,000. The starter, however, stip
ulated that he must .then have until
February 1 to pive a decided answer
Bob Smith's apprentice, Larsen, pilot
ed two winners, both from the stable

old proved a trifle expensive for Bob.

-VO1IJS OF THE TRACK.
Oarsman had Tommy Burns on his
back in the JiotK) mile and a sixteenth
handicap at Ingieside yesterday and
met with more success than on Christ
mas dav.
L<mis Kempner's three-year-old was
a signed 116 pounds and was consid
ered such a good thing that he was
P-ayed down from 2Â»_ to 1 to 6 to 5.
Tho Eastern gelding won. owing chiefly
to the vicorous and desperate finish
Burns put up. Bullman. astride Fos-
BU. made all the running and after a
l^ig drive only lost by a short head.
Haack moved uÂ» by degrees from
tenth position with Divina. taking show
honors.
Perfect racing weather and the fine
"st of starters for the handicap at
tracted a large attendance. Stuyve and
oarsman were the only successful
choices.
Looking on paper possibly a shade
the best of the ordinary bunch of plat
ers in the o-pening Futurity course
sprint, the erratic Tuck Back was made
favorite. Hildebrand handled him with
good Judgment, but was beaten out at
the wire by Goddess of Night, a 7 to 1
f-not. After cutting out the pace old
t-aul of Tarsus ran third.
Bob Smith's Waterspout was given
?* r "T, t eCiSi Â° n Â° Ver Et Tu Bru^ at
the finish of the maiden two-year-old
event. Et Tu Urute, ridden by Johnny
Daly, took the lead in the stretch and
looked to be winning, when Larsen
drew his whip on Waterspout and, ap
parently outriding Daly, got the ver
a.ct. Oro Rose ran third, half a length
bo.ore Kentish Shrew, the favorite.
Saintly went to the post an even
money chance for the Futurity course
spin next decided and certainly did cut
a lively figure, never being a factor.
i>e.l rode aa excellent race on the 12
to 1 .shot Hellas and in a driving finish
beat Chords Boy half a length. Amasa
started out to make the running but
couldn't keep up the pace.
Johnny Schorr's Sunday horse Avenger
was made the medium of a plunge
tvhen betting on the six and a half
furlong two-year-old race opened and
all the smart ones fell. Closing a 6 to 5
favorite, the colt at no stage looked
dangerous and finished beyond the
money. Telephone, at 4 to 1. made all
the running and, with something in re
serve, led Bombardier out more than
a length. Instructor was third.
Bookmaker Frank Lanterman's col
ors were victorious first, rattle out of
the box. His useful gelding Stuyve
was an even money chance for the first
mile and fifty-yard run and won all the
**y. Rosarie looked the contender in
the stretch, but tired and lost the place
to Axminster.
There were a number of hold-overs
in the police courts yesterday. George
Batteate, accused of the crime of burg
lary in the candy store of W. I* Oliver
at 646 Greenwich street, was bound
over for trial in the Superior Court by
Judge Conlan in bail of $2000. On a
charge of robbing. Lulgl Sangali of his
beloved accordeon and also taking $2
from the pockets of his victim the
same defendant was told to furnish
$3000 for his future appearance. Bat
teate chose confinement in lieu of the
money."
Leon B.' Neat, the burglar of the
Plymouth Hotel, who tried to poison a
pawnbroker In a further attempt at
plunder, was offered his liberty by
Judge Cabaniss on condition that he
furnish $4000 bail on two charges of
burglary. Neat did not have the money
in his inside pocket so he went back
to jail.
John P. O'Brien, a boatbullder by
occupation,, failed to provide for a
pretty wife and two children. Judge
Mogan ordered him into custody until
he pungled up $10 and made provision
for future allowances.
Henry Jackson \ received six months
in the County Jail because he couldn't
remember what he did with a watch
and Bankbook he stole. Jackson is the
man who* nearly escaped from Judge
Mpgan's court Monday by impersonat
ing a man by the name of Patrick
Kearney. If Kearney will only come
into court the record will be^cU:ared up.

to-day.
: There is a "big gun" man in town
and he hails from Great Falls, Mont.
They have great falls In the autumn
in' Montana. Also "in San Francisco
there are falls and, James Corbin dis
covered the fact. He was accused of
making a nuisance of himself and his
gun on Kearny. street y and was finally
tucked under the arm of law and order
in the person of Policeman ' R. p. _e
Guire. Judge Conlan found, him guilty
of carrying a concealed; weapon yes
terday/and will sentence him to-day.
Clerk Jack Rice also .found him guilty
because Corbin was contumacious 'and
knew entirely too much law for a Great
Falls man. Probably Corbin will get

Arthur T. Winter was captured by
the "Italian JDmbassador" of San Fran
cisco in an lattempt to rob Henry E.
Ellis. ' Before other words are wasted
it should be explained that the "Italian
Embassador" is Jack Holland, who
drives a patrol wagon for the Har
bor Police Station. In these perilous
times of affronting foreign poAvers, the
use of names is dangerous. The State
Department might be called upon to
apologize and none of us want to bend
the knee just at present. So it was
only Jack Holland who caught . the
thief. Harry Ellis was the complain
ing witness against the defendant. It
was shown in court that Winter had
attempted to rob Ellis, whorls an eld
erly man, and the screams of the vic
tim had attracted the attention of Hol
land, who was peacefully enjoying a
sprig duck in a restaurant between Da
vis and Drumm streets.. Holland threw
the napkin into, the candelabra and
dashed forth madly to the rescue. He
caught the footpad and brought him
before Judge Mogan yesterday. Win
ter was bound over in the sum of
.$3000 to appear before the Superior
Court.
It was bargain day In the fruit store
of John Miller at 452 Turk street when
James Keefe and Charles Miller in
vaded it on Sunday night. The pro
prietor was astonished to receive a to
mato Just abaft of the* main rigging of
his eye. A carrot got him on the maxil
lary nerve and three luscious bananas
from the plantations of Nicaragua land
ed on various parts of his person. Not
being a zealot in the cause of vege
tarianism, Mr. Miller caused the arrest
of the two young men who tried to
force the products of the soil upon him
in such an unseemly manner. Judge
Mogan gave Keefe ten days' confine
ment and his less strenuous partner
was allotted flye days. Judge Mogan
thought that this breakfast food prop
osition had gone the limit when a vege
tarian diet had to be ground into a
man like a baseball pitcher lands on a
hard hitter.
Thomas Murphy and William Kelley
were charged before Judge Mogan yes
terday with stealing a horse and buggy.
In Texas this would be a capital of
fense ainless the offender crossed the
Louisiana line ahead of the Sheriff. In
the case yesterday it was admitted by
the complaining witness, McCarthy,
that the arrest was not Justified. .He
said he had taken his two friends for
a ride and stopped at various^ saloons.
He admitted that he kept them waiting
while, he argued politics with the bar
tenders. Murphy and Kelley tired of
the delays and drove home alone, leav
ing McCarthy deep in the discussion
of the Panama incident". Judge Mogan
had listened to political arguments be
fore, and he realized the weariness of
the young men who were either forced
to listen br steal a horse. He thought
that horse stealing was Justifiable in
such cases and dismissed the charges.
' B. H. Keplan told Judge Cabanisa
yesterday that he was a carriage- mak
er from New York and was suffering
from illness. This excuse he offered for
hot 'contributing to the support of his
wife and three children.
Mrs. Keplan had a different story to'
tell. â¢ She averred that Keplan was in
a full state of strength and earning a
good living. On one occasion, she said,
she found him in the company of Mrs.
Dr. Mighal, with fourteen champagne
bottles strewn around. His condition
did not appeal to.. her as being one of
absolute poverty, bo she had him ar
rested for non-support. Mrs. Dr. Mighal
is the seventh daughter of the seventh
daughter, who conducts the business
of peering over the veil of the future
and telling applicants what to-morrow
will bring. When Keplan was arrested
by Officer McMurray he was the
company of the seeress.
Among the exhibits offered by the
defendant was a medical certificate
from Dr. Albert Abrams, who has of
fices at Van Ness avenue and Califor
nia street. The certificate assured the
court that the doctor had examined
Keplan several months before and
found him rather inclined to illness. It
concluded with the statement that the
defendant would be unable to do physi
cal labor for several months. Doubt
less the good doctor had been "peering
i:*o the future himself.
Judge Cabaniss thought the case was
so aggravated that he ordered the de
fendant into custody until such time
as he could give .positive assurances
that he, would pay $12 50 weekly for
the support of his wife and children.
In the meantime Mrs. Dr. Mighal will
be obliged . to find some new star to
gaze at for her information as to the
days that will come.
C. E. Dickey, ah employment agent
with offices in the Donohoe building,
is attempting* to defeat a - law passed
by the last Legislature making it a
misdemeanor for. employment agencies
to collect. more than. 10 per cent of the
first month's wages of the applicant
for furnishing him a chance to make a
living.1
< Dickey pleaded guilty bc.'ore Judge
Cabanlss yesterday to the crime of tak
ing $30 from/H. W. Knighton for se
curing him a place as bookkeeper,
which was admitted to be much in ex
cess of the statutory provision. His
attorney stated it was merely a* test
case, as' the employment agencies de
sired to have the 10 per cent provision
passed upon by the Supreme Court to
learn whether it was constitutional. A
fine .of 520 was imposed by consent and
notice of appeal given.

Matters of Interest to Mariners and
XE\YS OF THE OCEAN*.
When Major Dcvol, superintendent
here of the army transport service,
was in the Philippines he nude a rec
ord for himself as a railroad man.
Since his assignment to his present
duty he has developed into a first-class
steamship manager, and now, on a
modest scale, he is in the field as a
successful marine architect. And all
this in* addition to building an enviable
record as a soldier. Tnc handsome
gasoline launch just completed for ser
vice, between Alcatraz Island and the
city was built according to specifica
tions drawn up by Major Devol and
the railroading - steamboating - ship
building soldier is well pleased at the
successful carrying out of his ideas.
The launch was out for a spin yester*
day and gave a good account of her-
Felf. She will turned over to Uncle
Sam January 1.
The launch will be of great value
to the army families isolated on Al
catraz and hitherto dependent for com
munication with the city upon the reg
ular'but few daily trips of thÂ» steamer
General McDowell. The new launch
will be at the disposal of the com
mandant of the island and every offi
cer stationed there is already figuring
on the social possibilities of an inde
pendent transportation.
The launch, which was built by
Woodley & Cryer. is 50 feet long. 10.9
feet beam and 5 feet deep. Eastern
oak is the material used in the hull
and the cabin has been handsomely
finished, comfortably cushioned and
equipped with conveniences not usually
found on gasoline launches. A llfty
horsepower engine will send the launch
through the water at a 10-knot clip
and incidentally keep in commission an
array of sixteen-randle power electric
lamps and provide illumination for the
searchlight with which the little boat
has been provided. The launch cost
about $6000 and is one of the best
equipped craft of her kind ever seen In
the harbor. ' s
ins; and Is dup here to-day about noon.
Thf Pacific Mail wharves are crowded to the
roof with fr<*lKht. The Oanfa's cargo was dis
charged faster than it rmiH be hauled away,
and while it was still piled on the wharf the
Siberia arrived and commenced vomiting: end
leps bales from her capacious holds. Inciden
tally, the Nippon Maru has discharged a canto
and received another and the Panama boats
have been busy as ueual with heavy New York
/relBht. The result Is an object leswnn on the
Immensity of San- Francisco's Oriental trade
and the inadequate facilities pro\ - lded to han

Johnny Ritchie, ez-champion ban
tam-weight of the Qivorld, knock
ed out Georgie Curran in the
'second round. Ritchie was also
in.stilled with new life and sur
prised everybody by his cleverness
jnd punching ability. Curran started
out to mis things in the first round,
but was stopped by some heavy left
hand jabs. Curran landed frequently,
but most of his swings went wild. In
the second Ritchie measured his op
ponent and whenever he swung wild
ly he would step in with a heavy
swing. Two or threp landed a and Cur
ran was up In the air. Ritchie pent
Curran to the floor with two rights
to the head in rapid succession and
Georgie took thp rount. The end was
not far off. Ritchie rushed Curran
into a corner and caught him a heavy
right on the jaw and Curran went out
ct business.
Murphy's nose was battered out of
shape and he bled profusely. The old
timer presented a gory appearance
and the spectators waited expectantly
lor the end. Murphy surprised them,
however, by going the distance and
be had a shade the better of the. bout.
McDevitt was hissed* for calling the
contest a drav.
When Murphy entered the ring he
i\;ts given a great reception. He had
Jimmy Carroll, the ex-lightweight
champion, in his corner, and the days
when the California Athletic Club was
In its prime were recalled.
Australian Billy Murphy came to
life lftst night and made an ex-ama
teur niinied Jack Evans look like a
novice. Referee Jimmy McDevitt
called the bout a draw after six fast
rounds and in doing so gave the old
timer a shade the worst of it. Mur
phy showed some of his old time form
and was cheered in every round. qHjs
left hand went out with unerring fre
quency, but his overhand swings went
widf of their mark. He was as
â¢foxy" as old man Fitzsimmons and
actually scared Evans by his wild ef
forts. Evans staggered Murphy in
every round, but could not finish him.
Murphy on two occasions sent Evans
to the floor for the count and had
him all at sea.
Billy Murphy and Johnny Ritchcy
Show to Good Advantage.
PRELIMINARY BATTLES.
Emery is a handsome young man.
about 24 years old, a swell dresser and
a general favorite at Boclal functions.
Captain of Detectives Martin 'ias de
tectives working on the case and it is
expected that Emery will soon face his
accusers.
He worked in that capacity for sev
eral months, when the management
discovered that the young man had
failed to account for various sums
of money. He was called to account
and admitted his wrongdoing. He
pleaded for a chance and the firm did
not prosecute him. He was relieved of
his position, however, soon after.
Further inquiry brought to light the
fact that there is no such person as
Rufus Haws or Rufus Thomas. The
signature to the check is very much
blurred and clumsily executed. It is
hard to decipher it, but the signature
resembles either Haws or Thomas.
It is said that the young man has
passed many checks of the same va
riety around town. He was known to
have been spending money quite freely,
although no one quite understood how
he did it, as his position did not war
rant his living in the style in which he
managed to exist.
Young Emery is the son of the late
Rufus C. Emery, formerly manager of
the Arctic Oil Works, a prominent
citizen and member of the Knights
Templar. The father died about a year
ago and soon after young Emery went
to work as a solicitor for the firm of
Whltaker & Ray.
The detectives are on a q,ulet hunt
for Elmer E. Emery, a likely looking
young man, who is accused of having
passed many bogus checks around
town. It is charged that he passed a
bad piece of paper on the firm of Gant
ner & Mattern, proprietor of a knitting
establishment, and he also, it is said,
victimized the firm of Whltaker & Ray.
for which he formerly worked.
Emery passed off the fictitious check
on Gantner'& Mattern on December 23.
He went into the store and ordered
some furnishing goods. In payment he
'gave a check for $30 drawn on the First
National Bank of this city, bearing the
signature either Rufus Haws or Rufus
Thomas, a blur making it impossible to
tell which.
. He is well known at the store and
when one of the proprietors said to him
in a jocular .way. "Well. I hope this
paper Is not bogus," the young man
smiled and replied, "Oh, no; it's all
right. It is signed by my uncle. He
became generous this Christmas and
passed me out a few of these."
Nothing more was thought of the
matter till yesterday, when the check
was sent back marked "void." An in
vestigation was commenced and it re
vealed the fact that no such person as
Rufus Haws or Rufus Thomas had any
funds in the First National Bank.
M. Carlton Sellgman is a fugitive
from justice. He was waiting: trial in
Judge Dunne's court on a charge of
obtaining money by false pretenses and
having failed to appear in court on
two occasions when the case v/as called
the Judge Issued a bench warrant yes
terday for his arrest and declared his
bonds forfeited. His sureties aie John
A. Drplet. 634% Broadway, and W. A.
Stone, broker, 149 Lily avenue. Both
qualified on real estate.
Seligman was arrested on August 1
on comr>la!nt of the local manager of
the Conservative Life Insurance Com
pany of Los Angeles, who alieged that
while Seligman was a solicitor for the
company he had received about $800
commission on policies he had obtained
by false representations. The particu
lar charge on which he was arrested
was for obtaining $60 commission on a
policy in favor of Attorney George H.
Bahrs. He represented himself to-
Bahrs as the local manager of the com
pany and agreed to engage Bahrs as
attorney for the company, promising
him a retainer of $300 per year. He
was held to answer on the charge by
Police Judge Cabaniss on August 28
and his bonds fixed at $1000.
While out on bonds Sellcrman pre
tended to open a wholesale and retail
liquor house at 317 Clay street. About
the beginning of October hs went to
it. L. Ray, internal revenue and cus
toms broker, and wanted him to look
after his bonded" business. He told
Ray that his uncle in St. Lou!s, J. Bas
sard Jr.. would supply him with ample
funds and Ray took him to his own
bank, where Seligman deposited a draft
for $1500 on Bassard. On the strengtJi
of the draft Ray advanced Seligman
$250. "Word was received from Bas
sard that he would not honor any of
Seligman's drafts and Ray notified the
police. Seligman was arrested, but
later paid back the money to Ray and
no action was taken against him.
Before Seligman came here lie had a
meteoric career in cities on Piiget
Sound. On March 21, 1901, he was ar
rested in Seattle for forgery, but his
mother paid the amount and he was
not prosecuted. He also, according to
Chief of Police Hunt of Portland,
passed worthless checks in Tacoma and
Spokane. On June 4, 1901, he was ar
rested in Portland for forgery, and
after being in jail for several months
was.released, his mother coining again
to the rescue with money. '
â¢ Last week Seligman got into trouble
in San Jose for passing a worthless
check, but paid the amount and was
released from custody. That was the
last heard of him. It is said that his
father committed suicide through his
son's misdeeds and his mother died
recently from a broken heart.

Hides are quoted somewhat firmer, as Eu
rope has recently been a free buyer in the
East. Dry stock is quoted higher, but salted
stock r* mains unchanged.
Tfca .situation in Hops continues satisfactory.
Owing to the recent brisk demand the supply
In growers' hands all over the Coast has teen
reduced to a fraction of the crop, and the
feeling Is very steady at the good prices.
There is more doing in Wool and quite^ a
little ha3 been moved during the pa3t few

NEW YORK. Dec. 29.-The rise In call
money "rates to a 7 per cent maximum to
day had the unmistakable effect of the prepara
tion for the annual settlements and made it
self felt in the i-tock speculation. An effort
was made to retrieve the reaction in the late
dealings by vigorous advances in United States
Steel stock* and in Southern Pacific and Union
Pacific, but the general list did not respond
effectually to this treatment, and prices fell
back again, making the closing weak and
active. The day's net changes show some fair
gains In the active list and some striking
trains in the Inactive specialty lift, but the
highest prices of the day were not held In any
case and the gains were wiped out in conspic
uous stocks. The flurry in the money market
had more effect in suspending the buying and
the bidding up process than In inducing any
â¢rtensive liquidation. The feverish and ex
cited tone of the cotton market probably re
flected also a process of clearing up for the
year-end settlements. ' It has scarcely been
exacted that the year would be turned with no
perceptible pinch In the money market, espe
cially since the revelation of the heavy loan
expansion last week. The fact that require
ments for January disbursements call â¢ cer
tainly for $135,000,000, and up to an estimated
maximum of $150,000,000, points to the inev
itable necessity of a temporary pinch while
this huge sum is changing hands. It was
well understood that while the sums accumu
lated In preparation for these needs were lying
on deposit, and Idle they, were put oat on call
until they were wanted, with, the clear pros
pect that loans would be called in very large
volume about the first of January. But the
market has advanced in face of these secu
rities in the conviction that the flurry - In
money would certainly be Â¦ brief and that the
resources in hand would quickly return to the
channels of tbe money market. The action of
prices to-day brought some reconsideration to
the "speculative minds, . as is invariably the
case -with a reversal of Â¦ a market Â¦ movement
without regard to new developments.- Â¦Â¦ Â¦

The situation in Hay is becoming very firm.
Receipts are light, stocks up north and down
south are small and local dealers say that both
the two northern States, jÂ».s well as the south

dry weather is beginning to Influence the mar
ket, as letters of complaint on this score are
being received from Gllroy, Holllster and other
large districts south of the bay. Prices show
no change, however.

NEW YORK. Dec. 20. â Opening weak at an
advance of 1 oolnt -to a decline of 11 points,
the cotton market to-day ruled sensationally
active, with fluctuations that for rapidity, vio
lence, breadth and Irregularity have not been
witnessed before in the recollection of th*
trade. Cables at first were steady, but later
eared off under what was described ns Ameri
can sellins and after tho local opening prices
for the flist few minutes ruled weak under
liquidation, showing at the end of tho first
fifteen minutes let losses .of about 20 to 25
points. Following this the local bull leaders
started buylnz and prices advanced to about
the final firure of last night. During the re
malndfr of the morning fluctuations, while
Irregular, showed a. downward tendency until
shortly after midday, when they were at about
the lowest tiolnt s> far for the session, with
March selling around 13.01c, May at 14c and
July at 14.03e. The market had adopted a
rather steady look around this level, when
suddenly there came such an outburst of sell-
Ing as has rarely been seen. In less than no
time -.irlces were tumbling. July selling down,
from l3.0â¬c to l.'t.SOc In two salts, whllo
March reached 13.05c and May 13.4Sc, these
being net declines- of a little over %c. , Al
most Bt once, however, the bis bulls started
buying, the room <xecuted a rlght-about-fac,
and within thirty minutes from the beginning
of the decline prices had recovered nearly half
of the loss. Tl'.e market then tamed down
somewhat and closed steady at a net decline
of 41 to 53 -mints. Smiles were estimated at
1,500,000 bales.

Late rr.ail advices from New York say:
"The distribution on i~mall orders is excep
tionally large for this time ot the year, but
jobl>trs jrive r.o indication of a desire to more
than cover the wants of the moment. Prunes
attract mctt attention, and in addition to the
very good jobbing demand from the home trade
thtre is isaid to be more t>r lo?s inquiry and

Dried Fruit in New York.
The demand for well-colored Navel Oranges
showed considerable Improvement and. although
such Â«tock was more plentiful than previously,
prices were firmer. Several leading dealers
were of the opinion that well-colored stock
would be cleaned up before the end of the
week, as receipts are expected to be light, and
there will be no auction sales until after the
turn of the year. Tangerines were in fair re
quest at steady rates and Japanese Mandarins
were gradually cleaning up. Grape Fruit waa
lower under Increased receipts and a slack de-.
mnnd. The Apple market was dull and feature
less, with stocks of all grades heavy. Quinces
were offering freely at very low prices, but at
tracted very little attention. Pears and Per
simmons were steady at unchanged rates. A
chÂ»>st of MalJnda Strawberries came In and
sold in a peddling way at^l per chest. Stocks
of Cranberries are limited Wt a few barrels and
they will soon disappear altogether. :

No fanring operations on account of continued

Clear, warm weather continued during the

I'laces. The drought Is seriously retarding
plowing aÂ«d seeding. Feed is becoming very
scarce, and, although there Is a fair supply
of last reason's hay In most places, the long
tinucd use of dry feed has seriously affected
cattle. The water supply is failing rapidly
owing to hf avy Irrigation of orchards. No ma

coal the latter. Heavy frosts occurred fre
quently, but caused no damage. Plowing and
bending ate progressing rapidly where the foil
is m:ficicntly moist to work. Early sown
grain Is up in many localities and making good
growth. Pruning and cultivating orchards and
vineyards continue. Green feed is scarce In
the central and southern portions of the valley,
l>ut plentiful In the northern section. Stock
are healthy, but thin where green feed Is
scarce. The orange crop Is about harvested;
it was large and of excellent quality. Rain is
badly needed.

LOCAL MARKETS.
CHICAGO. Dec. 29.â Tho wheat market was
rather nervous and was influenced mainly by
tho Northwestern markets. The opening was
rirm. wit* a, stood General demand from com
mission houaes and local traders. " Offerings
were light. ThÂ» bull factors at the start
were a reduction from the last estimate Of
20,000.000 bushels* in this year's crop and the
uncertainty surrounding the Eastern situation.
Commission houses became llbc'rul sellers early,
due to a report from Argentina stating that
the weather was Improving. There was also
considerable liquidation. May was forced
down to SÂ»c. nft.r opening a shade to Vi' f J%c
higher at Sl%Â«SI%c. May then advanced to
84 ;l ,c. The close was steady, with May at
84 Vic.
Corn had a firm undertone and prices held
up well until late in tho day. The Govern
ment's final estimate on the crop was con 1
sidered bul.'Ish and was the principal factor
in supporting prices early in the session. The
action of wheat and the weakness in the cash
article had a depressing influence toward tho
close and caused some reaction. ! The close
was steady. After opening a shade higher to
J/SC lower at 4uc to 45V k e, May eold between

Northern Business.
Two more cars of Western Poultry were
marketed, making three thus far this week. The
demand for Western waa steady and fine large
stock brought higher prices than on **\e pre
ceding day. The market for domestic cltlckens
was weak owing to the abundance of Western,
but dealers were not trying to force aales and
prices were steady. Receipts of dressed Tur
keys were 57 cases, mostly Western. Prime
Californlan stock was in good request at the
maximum quotation, but poor quality offer
ings were dull owing to the competition of oM
stock that had been placed In cold storage
after Christmas. Ll\-e Turkeys were dull, but
prices were no lower.
There was not much doing in Game, and
Mallard Sprig Widgeon and small Ducks
were quoted lower. ' Hare waa suddenly scarce
and prices had a sharp advance.

Ah Lim, a Chinese cook, recently
from Sacramento, was booked at the
City Prison yesterday by Detective
McMahcli and Policeman M. Walsh
on a charge of burglary. He was ar
rested on December 22, but the war
rant was only sworn to yesterday.
Ah Lim entered the residence of
George McGillivray. . 1600 Leaven
worth street, by the rear door on the
afternoon of December 22. He was
discovered searching the bureau
drawers in one of the bedrooms by
the occupants of the house. The door
of the room was promptly locked and
Ah Lim was detained till the police
were notified and arrived with the pa
trol wagon.
The defense of Ah Lim is that he
called at the lvouse to ask for em
ployment as cook. Not receiving any
answer to his knock on the rear door
he decided to go inside and wait till
some one came.

cerns and they ivill strive to improve
'their condition.
"I only know that it has been decided
to declare that road unfair , in Jan
uary. Beyond that I have nothing >to
say." . /' *
"When W. E. Davidson was asked if
he knew anything about the determina
tion of the American Federation of
Labor to declare the Santa Fe system
unfair, he said:
The. unorganized condition of the
Santa Fe system has always been a
source of trouble to the telegraphers on
the lines of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. When the general grievance
committee, headed by W. E. Davidson,
demanded an increase aggregating
$100,000 a year from the Southern Pa
cific Company early in the present
year, it was met wltl- the statement
tliat the Santa Fe system was In direct
competition with the Southern Pacific
Company, and yet the Southern Pacific
Company was paying its telegraphers
as high as one-third more than thejine
with which it was competing. Several
cases were cited, particularly that of
Bakersfield, which each road touches in
direct competition, where the Southern
Pacific Company pays $77 50 a month
to telegraphers, whereas men that are
performing the same work for the
Santa Fe receive but $55. But despite
this and other arguments Mr. Davidson
succeeded in having $100,000 distributed
annually over the Southern Pacific
system. â¢'â¢/Â¦ r " !
This new move upon the Santa Fe
has come from the Ec-t, and the coast
representatives of the order knew noth
ing of it until the official announcement
reached them. ' .
Ever since the telegraphers lost their
strike on the Santa Fe system some
years ago they have been waiting for
an opportunity to rcover their lost
ground upon this big system. Several
efforts have been made to get Pres
ident Ripley of the Santa Fe to recog
nize the Order of Railway Telegra
phers, but Without avail. He has al
ways said that he would have nothing
more to do with them, and all over
tures by the men have been rejected.
The matter came up at the last na
tional meeting of the Order of Railway
Telegraphers in St. Louis and It was
a matter that caused a great deal of
debate. There were ten delegates
present from the Pacific Coast, headed
by W. E. Davidson, general chairman
of the Southern Pacific Division of the
Order of Railway Telegraphers.
As Mr. Davidson represents a road
that is thoroughly organized in the in
terests of his orderâ more than 90 per
cent of the dispatchers and operators
between Prj-tland, San Francisco; Og
den and New Orleans being members
of that organization â it was natural
tha* he, with the other coast delegates,
should take a great deal of interest in
the matter of adding the Santa Fe sys
tem to the organized roads. How to
accomplish this was the work to which
the coast delegation addressed itself
most arduously. Coast Organizer Da
vidson was in favor of first organizing
the Santa Fe system quietly and then
applying for recognition from Presi
dent Ripley, but Grand President Per
ham of the Order of Railway Telegra
phers was in favor of placing the road
upon the "unfair" list of his order and
the American Federation of Labor.
This latter method has been adopted.
TELEGRAPHERS TROUBLED.
REFUSED RECOGNITION.
The Santa Fe Railroad eystem has
been' placed upon the blacklist of the
American Federation of Labor and all
of those who are affiliated with that or
ganization of national scope will be in
structed not to ride upon the lines of
that corporation or ship freight there
on after January 1.
This action was taken by the cen
tral organization of the American Fed
eration of Labor at the request of the
Order of Railway Telegraphers, and is
due to the fact that the Santa Fe sys
tem has never recognized the. teleg
raphers' organization since the strike
on that system some years ago, which
the telegraphers lost. The Order of
Railway Telegraphers \ is connected
with the American Federation of La
bor, and it is now announced that im
mediately after the first of the year the
general organization will declare a boy
cott upon the big railway system and
will prohibit its members from patron
izing it in any way.
Whether this move will.be extend
ed any further is a question, but at
present the opposition to the Santa Fe
system will be manifested by a passive
boycott, and the road will be declared
"unfair", by the American Federation
of Labor.

President Richard Cornelius of the
Carmen's Union has given out a reply J
to the statement recently issued by i
Manager Chapman iof the United Rail
roads regarding the stopping of cars
at both sides of crossings. According
to Cornelius it is the fault of the com
pany and not the grlpmen and motor- I
men. i
According, to Cornelius when the
company ordered that all cars should
stop at both sides of car crossings it
allowed no extra time for the trips.
The men were warned that if they were
late they would be penallzeaj so, in
many instances, they have not the time
to stop at both sides of carlir.p cross
ings and reach their destinations on
schedule time. '

CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
"W r ., "WASHINGTON", Dec. V}.â Samuel
Gompera, president of the American
Federation of Labor, in an editorial in
the American FederattAniat, Just pub
lished, strongly advlse's union labor to
resist employers' associations and. all
efforts at wage reductions and at the
same time urges employers not to at
tempt to force the issue. The Import
ance of this utterance at thia time lies
In the fact that it come3 just after
Gompers* trip to New York, taken with
the view to terminating the intolerable
labor troubles of that city. Gompers
says: *
"We have urged and still urge em
ployers to pursue a more enlightened
course to avoid cutting wage?. TVe
have advised and shall continue to ad
vise our fellow workmen to resist re
ductions in wages by every lawful
means within their power, for, as we
have said before, 'it Is better to resist
and lose than not to resist at all.'
"Let workmen complacently accept
reductions in their wages and it will
be an invitation to repeat reduction at
will, intensifying depression and pro
voking an industrial crisis: forcing
down workers in the economic and so
cial scale and bringing on fearful pov
erty, misery and degradation. Resist
ance on the part of labor to reduction
of wages will chock this to a great de
gree and at least demonstrate to ignor
ant and shortsighted employers that
such course is exceedingly expensive
to them and will prevent Its repetition.
"Then, in the interest of workers, in
the interests of all our peopie. we urge
employers generally not to force the
issue by attempting to reduce wages.
To our fellow Workers we say, organ
ize, unite and federate and prepare to
resist to the uttermost any attempt to
invade our rights and take from us
the means by which we sustain our
selves and the dear ones dependent
upon us."
