ney of Delaware, the President to-day
requested the Postmaster General to sub
mit to him a report on *the recent retire
ment of Miss Huldah B. Todd, the post
mistress of Greenwood, Delaware.
It Is charged that Miss Todd was re
tired to make room for an Ad dicks sup
porter. Mr. Roosevelt knew nothing of
the fate of the Delaware postmistress
until his attention was called to it by
the newspapers. He afterward received
a personal letter on the subject. This
prompted him to desire an investigation.

There have Jbeen bigger celebrations of

more patriotic or enthusiastic than the
one held to-day. About 2500 Sons and
Daughters of the Golden West marched
through the streets to the music of band
and fife and drum. Fittingly, too, the
Pioneers and Mexican War Veterans, the
road builders Into this great common
wealth, preceded them in the line of

more than half a century ago. These old
State builders did not walk, however, but,

NEW ORLEANS, Sept 9.â Another es
caped convict from the Mississippi peni
tentiary presented himself to-day and
apologized for his escape. He is Brooks
Story, the notorious express robber, who
has escaped five times from the peniten
tiary.
To-day Story presented himself at the
Governor's mansion and explained that
he had received word that his wife
was critically 111 in Kosciusko, more
than 100 miles away, a week ago,
and he broke out of prison to get to her
bedside. As soon as she was out of dan
ger he returned to the penitentiary.
Story belongs to one of the best fam
ilies in Mississippi and In her young
womanhood his wife was noted for her
remarkable beauty. Evil companions led
the young husband astray, and holding
up trains and robbing express offices soon
became his occupation. He was finally
caught and sent to the penitentiary to
serve a ten-year term.

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 9.â It was evident
from the trend of the discussion on the
part of the members of the State Board
of Equalization at a meeting to-day that
the assessment of many of the counties
of the State will be raised. There is a
well-founded belief that the assessment
of the city and county of San Francisco
will be among those to be raised.
Although the board has until the 12th
Inst. in which to arrive at a conclusion
regarding the county assessments, It may
take final action any time between now
and that date. After the meeting to-day
the members . of the board declined to
make any statement, saying they would
not commit themselves before taking final
action. .
Pratt put spurs to his horse and two
posses were soon in hot pursuit. One of
them captured the fugitive at Hash Knife

Myrnberg had married the woman he
loved and that h* was crazed by Jeal

One posse is still out, not having learned
of the capture.
EL PASO, Tex., Sept. 9.â E. Myrnberg,

strode up and fired two shots at him
from the 30-30 rifle. The first shot passed

ning nearly sixty miles an hour at the

t fs-csflc open eve nt, one of the front tires
on tie machine burned through and ex
ploded, throwing tho car into the fence
and injuring Frank Shearer, a spectator,
so terribly that be died in an ambulance
â¢â¢n route to the hospital. The car -went
fifty feet through the air and Oldfleld,
T7ho kept tis seat, had a marvelous es
cape from death. He received several
cuts about the body and had one rib
broken.
It was an afternoon of accidents at the
track, two other high power machines
coming to grief because of the tires. For
tunately no one was hurt ia either of
these accidents.
OMfleld's sparker gave out a few feet
from the tape In the race during which
the accident occurred and Oldfield lost
nearly two miles before he repaired the
damage and started after Harry Cun
ningham, the only other entry. The tires
of the raaefcine were the same ones he
used at Cle\'eland and as he was turn
ing Into the stretch on his seventh mils ,
the friction on the right front tire burned
through and it exploded. The track is
banked high at the turn and the car with
ils tremendous momentum shot for the
outer edga of the track, which is six
feet above the ground beyond. Oldfield
had just time enough to twist his brake
and head for a spot between two trees.
Shearer was standing against the fence
at this point and the car struck him
F^uarely, breaking both legs and fractur
ing his skull. He was thrown seventy
five feet and never recovered conscious
ness. Oldfleld had presence of mind
enough to throw himself backward on
the fiat deck cf the car, which went
crashing through a low tree and landed
a complete wreck fifty feet from where
It went through the fence. A brother of
Shearer was standing near him and had
a narrow escape.

In Paris there Is a persistent rumor that
M. Constans, the French Ambassador la
Constantinople, Intends to resign as a
protest against the apathy shown by his
Government. According to a Sofia dis
patch to the Dally Express the British
agent there has already notified Bulgaria
that Great Britain Insists that she pre
vent the passage of bands into Mace
donia.
Little credence is attached to a story
published in the Vienna Die Zeitung that
Turkish troops have been ordered to cross
the Bulgarian frontier.
Count Goluchowski, the Austrian Chan
cellor, had a long conference with Em
peror Francis Joseph at Budapest yester
day and common diplomatic action by the
powers against Bulgaria is again said
to be in preparation.
The Italian fleet is held in readiness at
Sicily, so that It could reach Turkish wa
ters within forty-eight hours, but Italy
will not take any action except in accord
with the powers.
The Dally Telegraph's correspondent In
Varna reiterates the determination on the
.part of the Bulgarian Government to hin
der every manifestation liable to lead to
war. He adds that Prince Ferdinand is
In daily receipt of menacing letters and as
a result the palace Is strongly guarded,
the locks have been changed on the doora
and all persons desiring admission are
strictly scrutinized.
It Is learned from Phillppopolls that tha
Macedonian committee is actively organ
izing new revolutionary bands, of which
170 have been formed in Eastern Roume
lla and Macedonia since Boris SarofofC
assumed the direction of the Adrianople
committee. The leaders of the bands duf
ing the last six months have imported IDO
kilograms of dynamite, mostly from Aus

which have all been warehoused in the
suburbs of Philippopolls.

Be Mobilized.
LONDON. Sept. 10.â Except that the
Consuls in Salonica are again asking for
the protection of warships, there is lit
tle direct news this morning from the
seat of the Macedonian troubles, but
there is a plentiful crop of sensational
statements, which It Is impossible to con
firm or deny. Among the latter Is the
assertion made in a Sofia dispatch to the
Seclo of Milan to the effect that it has
been decided to mobilize the Bulgarian
army. This is contrary to the avowed
policy of the Bulgarian Government, but
cannot be regarded as unlikely, as the
Turkish troops are concentrated at Geok
tepe, five miles from, the Bulgarian fron
tier.

capital of the State, rich in the traditions of
the Spanish and Mexican days, surrounded by
the most fruitful of valleys and circled by
vine-clad hills, with Institutions of learning
that are the pride of the nation, we glory in
our birthright and marvel at the magnincent

bers appeared in white flannel suits and
hats, with full dress vests.
The eighth division attracted a great
deal of attention. I. I*. Koppel was mar
shal, with Miss Lottie Wade, Mrs. Elsie
Docrr, Miss Florlne Rock and Miss May
Wade as aids. A cavalcade of nine
mounted young -ladies of Vendome Parlor
of Native Daughters headed the division.
Olympus Drum Corps and parlor followed.
There were sixteen of them in dark suits,
wearing regalias and carrying canes.
Minerva Parlor of Native Daughters
came next. There were twelve of these
young ladies . in white suits, wearing
white hats trimmed with popples. They
carried yellow parasols bearing the name

Native Daughters occupied a five-seated
carriage.. They were dressed in white

PROMINENT PARLORS THAT TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THE FIT
TING CELEBRATION OF THE FIFTY-THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF
THE ADMISSION OF CALIFORNIA INTO THE UNION
sive that has ever been seen in the north
era part of the State. The uniformed
companies, militia, firemen and fraternal
orders all combined to give freshness and
cplrlt to the picture. The fire engines and
tastefully decorated hose carts; the fine
line of variously bedecked vehicles. In
cluding some very attractive automobiles,
and the beautiful and artistic floats gave
the parade a tone of grandeur. The pres
ence of the chief executive of the State,
bland and smiling, and interested In every
feature of the display, put every one on
the best terms with the entire celebration.
Everything was applauded and the whole
city was ilght hearted and gay. The pro
cession extended for more than a mile
and, with four bands, made an animated
and striking pageant. After the mile of
march had been covered, bringing the
tiead of the procession for a second time
on the main street, the Governor and his
staff, in their carriages, drew out beside
the City Park, between Fourth and Fifth
streets, and reviewed the paraders as
Uiey passed by in countermarch. As com
pany after company passed, each cheer
ing heartily, Governor Fardee responded
with cheers and salute, his face beaming
responsive goodfellowship.
After the procession had been disband
ed crowds Hocked to Armory Hall to
hear the Governor's address. He spoke
for a quarter of an hour eulogizing our
great State, dwelling upon the Incalcu
lable richness of its resources and
prophesying its empirical wealth in the
future. He quoted history to show the
westward trend of empire and said that
the future commercial metropolis of the
world must lie upon the Pacific. The
Governor's manner was easy and earnest
and his voice strong and clear.
In the afternoon the competitive hose
races took place on Broadway. Teams
from Red Bluff, Oroville and Chlco strove
for victory, which virtually meant the
championship of Northern California.
The runs themselves were intensely ex
citing, but some tedious waits Intervened
between them. Chico won the contest
In the very creditable time of 33 1 -; seconds.
Both the visiting teams were beaten by
the swift water, Oroville falling to get
the nozzle attached and Red Bluff fumbl
ing at the hydrant.
Following the hose race a balloon ascen
sion was scheduled to take place on the
campus of the State Normal School
grounds, but owing to the delay on the
part of the performers the frontier sham
battle was fought before the ascension
was made. It was an interesting- specta
cle. A four-horse stage coach driving un
der the heavy trees on the Bidwell ranch
was set upon by Indians, and a spirited
running fight took place, ending In a hand
to-hand encounter. One victim of the at
tack was hung from a rude pole and
made the central figure In a diabolical
scalp dance. Just as this barbarous di
version was at its height a company of
militia, commanded by Captain William
White, rushed to the rescue. The fight
which followed was extremely close and
hot. but, overpowered by number, the In
dians slunk back step by step, until they
disappeared in the heavy jungle on the
banks of Chico Creek.
After this came the balloon ascension,
but owing to the strength of the wind an
elevation of -only about 500 feet was at
tained, and the performer was afraid to
detach his parachute, but came down on
the southern side of the city with his bal
loon. A grand tall was given in the even
ing In Armory Hall, and a band concert
drew large crowds to the city park.
GRASS VALLEY, Sept.

a picnic at Glenbrook Park. The

STRAW PAYROLL FRAUD
LEADS TO BIANY ARRESTS
Santa Pe Special Officers Unearth
Swindle That Involves a Num
ber of Employes.
SAN BERNARDINO. ,Sept 9.â The ar
rest of A. E. Eldrldge of Needles by
Santa Fe special offlcers a few days ago
proves to have been the beginning of an
effort to break up one of the most exten
sive attempts to swindle unearthed in the
history of railroading. Tne amount In
volved was not great, for, perhaps, it was
limited to $1300, but it is stated that at
least twenty employes are implicated in
the "straw payroll" system of which El
drldge was alleged to be the head. Al
ready five others are lodged here in Jail.
The pursuit of the guilty men is being
taken up eagerly by Sheriff Ralphs of
this county, and a large number of other
warrants are still out. although many
suspects took flight when they heard of
the arrest of some of the conspirators.
The system employed a man named
liutz, whose duty it was to find employes
who were willing to sign a voucher for a
full month when less than that amount
of work had been done, or for absolutely
bogus employes. Others under arrest in
clude Joseph Young, E. L. Marston and
William Dorsairt.

and din last night were only preliminary.
From the moment the parade started this
morning until the last special pulled out
of the depot at midnight with the visiting
parlors homeward bound there was no
cessation In the merriment. It was a
good-natured crowd.
In the afternoon there were literary ex
orcises in the park and they were well
attended. The work of entertaining was
Taken up by the parlor6 and at a dozen
different places there were "open houses"
and receptions, with music, dancing and
refreshments. The local parlors of Na
tive Sons and Daughters received at the
Native Sons' Hall, corner of Third and
San Fernando streets, and all afternoon
and evening there was a steady stream of
callers.
Dancing was indulged in and refresh
ments were served.
Rlncon Parlor. N. S. G. TV., and Orin
<2a Parlor, N. D. G. W., entertained In
Y. M. I. Hall. Dancing was enjoyed both
afternoon and evening and the place was
filled with puests. Mission Parlor had
its headquarters in Eagles" Hall and there
was no lack of hospitality and entertain
ment there. Pacific Parlor did honors at
the Hotfl St. James, and the members
entertained and amused a large number
of friends. Stanford Parlor had its head
quarters at the Hotel Vendome and lta
guests were loud in the praise of the
treatment they received. San Francisco
Parlor No. <9 was located in the Alcan

quarters in the Oou Fellows' building.
A large number of visitors attended the
bicycle races and others went to Alum
Reck Park. This latter place was lighted
â¢with electric lights to-night and many
ppont the evening there.
The streets were crowded with natives
to-night and drum corps paraded, while
others of the celebrators Jingled cowbells.
There was a steady procession from one
headquarters to another. About 11 o'clock
the visitors began to depart for their
homes on the excursion trains.
STATE PIONEERS
TAKE PROMINENT
PART IN PARADE
ALMOST the entire population turn
ed out to witness the parade and
the whole county was well rep
resented by delegations. Notwithstand
ing the pressing work of handling the
fruit In the orchards, many hundreds
la!d aside their tasks for the day to join
in the celebration. It Is estimated that
from fifteen to twenty thousand visi
tors were in the city.
It was nearly 11:30 o'clock before the
big pageant started. At that time the
sidewalks along the line of march were
crowded, while hundreds viewed the par
ade from windows and porches of houses.
The line of march was from Third and
St. James streets west to Second street;
south on Second street to San Antonio
strict; west to First street; north on
First ctreet to Hobson street; counter
march south on First street to Santa
Clara street; west on Santa Clara street
to Market street; south on Market street
to San Fernando street.
The entire line of march was decorat
ed. At short intervals across the streets
were stretched lines of streamers and
flags, while each block displayed large
Bear and American flags. All the build
ings unfurled large American flags and
the business houses decorated with bunt
ing and flags. The line of march was one
solid fringe of people. Ladies and chil
dren In their summer suits, with the
waving banners and flags overhead,
formed fitting banks for the stream of
Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden
West to march through. .
The day was not too warm, although
about noon the sun beat down pretty
hard. The paradcrs were lightly dressed
and nearly every one carried a parasol,
so no great inconvenience was felt.
About twenty-five hundred Native Sons
and Daughters were in line. Two hun
dred pioneers preceded the natives and a
dozen Mexican veterans were In car
nages. The procession was fifty min
utes in passing a given point The Na
tive Daughters presented an especially
fine appearance and In their pretty suits
attracted attention all along the line of
march.

San Franciscans Observe Anniver
sary With Best and Recreation.
Admission day was observed very quiet
ly In San Francisco yesterday. The ma
jor portion of the people went to picnics,
the park and beach, the circus or other
places of amusement. At the Chutes in
the evening there was an excellent dis
play of fireworks, consisting for the most
part of set pieces of the patriotic type.
Shops, stores, offices and factories were
generally closed, and the wage-earners
were enabled to enjoy a day of leisure.
The streets were very quiet in every por
tion of the city, although, the cars travel-
Ing toward the ocean were crowded with
passengers far into the evening.
There was no attempt at any general
celebration of the anniversary anywhere
in town, although the cessation of busi
ness in memory of the important occa
sion when California was accorded state
hood must of necessity have its effect in
bringing to the minds of the people at
large the thought of this event, which 13

Hefore Congress had granted our prayer for

sense of the honor and distinction that in the
name of the Native Sons of the Golden West
I bid you welcome at the celebration of the
fifty-third anniversary of the admission cf
California into the Union
DAVID M. BURNETT of San Jose,
grandson of California's first
Governor, delivered the address
of welcome on behalf of the local
parlors and city. In part he spoke as
follows:
WELCOMES GUESTS
ON BEHALF OF THE
FAIR GARDEN CITY
The members must bear a good reputation
for sobriety and Industry; they must follow
some respectable calling by which to make
a living, and, as a vital principle of the as
sociation, it encourages temperance among Its
members and recommends total abstinence
from all Intoxicating drinks.
Coupled with us In our dally work â cheerful
in their labors, brilliant In their public ex
pressions, loyal in their devotion to our State
and Its Interests, the Native Daughters of the
Golden West â our mothers, our wives, our sis
ters, our daughters and our sweethearts are
doing noble work for our State and our na
tion.
â¢ In caring for the sick. In nurturing' the or
phans, in buryingr the dead, in fostering -every
Interest that makes for the betterment of
n.ankln.1 and the Improvement of internal con
ditions In California, the Native Daughters of
the Golden West are impressing their magnifi
cent womanhood upon the entire State.
Every citizen of California owes an everlast
ing obligation to those hardy sons of every
soil who left their homes and faced the dan
gers of an unknown land to lay^ the founda
tion stones of this great commonwealth: those
Argonauts â
"Who crossed the plains, as of old the Pll
'grlms crossed the sea,
To make the West, as they the East, the
homestead of the free."
As the descendants of those hardy Pioneers.
The order of the Native Sons of the Golden
West is not a seiflsh organization; it Is found
ed upon the broad and undying principles
of friendship, loyalty and charity.
It was organized for the mutual ' benefit,
'mental Improvement and social Intercourse of
it's members; to perpetuate in the minds of
all native Californlans the memories of -one
of the most wonderful epochs In the world's
history â "the days of '49" â to unite them in
one harmonious body throughout the State by
the ties of a friendship mutually beneficial
to all and unalloyed by the bitterness of re
ligloug or political differences, the discussion
of which is most stringently forbidden In Its
meetings; to elevate and cultivate the mental
faculties; to rejoice with one another In,pros
perity, and to extend the "good Samaritan"
hand In adversity.
The Native Sons of the Golden West are
not alone orsanized to preserve the fame of
California and glorify the deeds of her found
ers, but to carry on with unceasing zeal the
grand work of building up our great State,
foeterlng and developing Its wondrous re
sources and educating its sons and daughters.
What the pioneers began so auspiciously
fifty-three years ago to-day, as their natural
heirs we native sons and native daughter*
are proud to carry on and build up. It is
but the natural impulse of our hearts, prompt
ed by our patriotism and loyalty, that has
called us together in the hospitable city of
San Jose. The thousands gathered here to
day are but the living evidences of the patriot
ism and loyalty of the citizens of our entire
State.
Mr. President, Pioneers, Native Daughters,
Native Sons. Ladies and Gentlemen: What
a flttln* tribute, after fifty-three ytars, we,
native sons and native daughters, children and
grandchildren of the pioneers, have come back
to San Jose, the first capital of the State of
California, we and a few of those old pioneers,
to commemorate the birthday of our beloved
State. '
GRAND PRESIDENT H. R. McNO
BLE was the orator of the day.
He was received with cheers and
delivered an eloquent address. He spoke
as follows:
PREDICTS BRIGHT
FUTURE FOR LAND
SO WELL BELOVED
the destiny of our beloved State rests upon our
shoulders.
â¢ The orders of the Native Sons of the Golden
West and the Native Daughters of the Golden
West stand as monuments to the memory of
those stout-hearted Pioneer ..inothers and fath
ers who made It ptfsalble to have the great
California of to-day;-they are not organized for
a day, but for all time.
There Is one feature that distinguishes the
organization of the Native Sons of the Golden
West from all other fraternal organizations,
and that feature Is loyalty to the State of Cali
fornia. It is one of the fundamental principles
of our organization.
We love these great United States and our
officers of government; we love and admire a
citizen of our Government from whatever part
of our possessions he may come; we never put
California before our nation. We always place
her, with all our love and devotion to her,
side by side with every other State or Terri
tory cf our great Federal bond and we love to
feel and know that she is a strong and grow
ing link in the great sisterhood of States.
Within the confines of our State nature, with
a generous Impulse, has strewn the fruits and
flowers, the mineral and climatic wealth of a
thousand climes. Progress and prosperity,
health and plenty have been written on every
page of her history; yet it remained for the
strident voice of Dewey's guns at Manila to
fully demonstrate to the world California's
patriotism, California's ability, California's
manhood, California's greatness. To-day we
are situated geographically In the center of
the greatest nation known to ancient or mod
ern history; a nation that commands the re
spect and admiration of the entire world.
Within the borders of our State every citi
zen stands on an equal footing; great as. has
been her progress, greater still are her oppor
tunities.
There Is no boy or girl, however humble his
birth, who, if he try, may not rise to be
mighty among us and famed In this nation of
the free. Such demonstrations as this, into
which we all enter so happily to-day, are but
the school houses of liberty erected In loving
devotion to our patriotic republican form of
government.
The spirit that supported the tired and
weary argonaut as he trudged across the great
plains a half century and more gone by; the
spirit that raised the bear flag at old Sonoma;
the spirit that brought California Into the
Union without the process of Territorial child
hood; the spirit that framed the first constitu
tion of our State; the spirit that hanged Caaey
and Corey to the improvised scaffold, the spirit
that laid the foundation of this great common
wealth, Is Instilled In the sons and daughters
of the pioneers. Our foremost object In life Is
and of right should be, to foster and . revere
that spirit. How well we are performing that
Facred trust is known to every household In our
8tate. While we still have hovering about us
the spirit and Inspiration of the golden days
of early California, we associate that spirit
at tho commencement of the twentieth cen
tury with the great and powerful genius of our
present prosperity and the greater possibilities
of the future.
Bright as are the pages of our fifty-three
years' history; heroic as have been the deeds
of her builders; wonderful as has been her
progress. It takes no seer or prophet to tell us
of her brilliant future. With her golden treas
ure, her millions of fertile acres, her harbors,
the wonder of the world; her thousand miles of
coast line fondly clasped by the peaceful queen
of oceans, the natural roadway of the mother
country to our possessions in the Orient â all
these opportunities in the hands of her citizens
of energy and ability, who can resist tho
hope that ere many decades California shall
be the empire State of this great nation?
"California, the Idol of our hearts! While
her valleys shall thrive the poppy, her snow
capped Sierras stand as sentinels to guard
her eastern portals, while her myriad golden
streams shall feed the peaceful old ocean at
her feet, may her eons be ever loyal to her call;
may their hearts ever beat with love and kind
ness for her upright citizens; may the God of
all nations watch over and guide her desti
nies for all time to come!
The band concert followed and was en-
Joyed by the large audience.
Lee Johnson, the well known song writ
er, has two very clever songs, "My Cocoa
nut Lou" and "My Pauline," which are

LOCAL POLITICS
CROP UP IN SAN
JOSE COMMITTEE
BUT one little incident aside from
the usual Admission day festivi
ties occurred in connection with
to-day's celebration. That was a dash of
local politics that had been hatched up
for the celebration, but the arrival of
Grand President Mc&oble soon straight
ened it out. Because Mayor Worswick
and his administration were not favored
by the leading lights in the Native Sons'
organization the committee in charge de
cided to snub the city's executive. Chief
of Police Carroll was also on the list to
be turned down and no invitation was
extended. to him to furnish" an escort for
the parade. By eome mistake Carroll
was invited by some of the members and
then the committee decided ( to ask that
only Native Sons on the force be fur
nished for an escort.
When the squad with Chief Carroll
lined up to-day in the lead of the proces
sion there were all nationalities in line.
Scheel Scores Popular Success.
A , second popular concert was given
yesterday at the Mechanics' Pavilion, di

that at the first concert last Monday. The
programme was similar to the preceding
one and was huccly enjoyed. Schubert's

It Is the glory of our American institutions
that the road to honor and distinction is open
to every cltlien, no matter how humble may
have been his origin, or how obscure his sta
tion In life. Intellect and sterling Integrity
are the products of no favored land. God has
scattered the seeds of genius by the side cf
the beaten highways and in many a lonely
home, and the voice of the republic reaches
all citizens with the same words of encour
agement and hope and calls them from the
plow, the mine, the forest and the factory
to Â«lt In the councils of the nation.
Let us rear upon the free soil of the West a
race of men and women worthy of a great and
an Independent State. There are victories of
the past that will serve as an Inspiration for
the future. The years open before us full of
hope and promise. For the love of our State,
to perpetuate her traditions and to consecrat-*
ourselves to every ennobling aspiration for the
future we have associated ourselves together.
If we are to make of California an example
to the world of a Just and well governed com
monwealth, diffusing the blessings of free gov
ernment, we must build upon the foundation
of a noble manhood. Character, in the up
building of a nation. Is everything. We are
leagued together to advance the interests of
our commonweaJth at all times. We stand for
the development of her resources, the iÂ»tlmu
latlngr of her industries, the beautifying- of her
cities, the irrigation of her valleys, the protec
tion of her forests, the preservation of her
landmarks, but. above all. for character and
nobility of manhood everywhere.
All the boundless wealth that sleeps within
our hills or brightens all our plains should
weigh as naught compared to our love for the
flag and the Union and those principles which
lie at the basis of popular government in
America. Deep rlanted in the heart of every
patriot is the sentiment of loyalty to some
thing which Is over and above all the mate
rial wealth and grandeur of nations, which
weds him to the soil, not on account of the
abundance of Its resources cr the pleasant ap
pearance of its landscape, but because upon
that roil the institutions he love* have found
rest and over it all is breathed the spirit of
freedom sanctified by the deeds of Its mar
tyrs.
Whatever concerns rhe welfare of the State
or adds to the happiness and prosperity of htr
I>eoi>le should be and is near to the hearts of
the young men of our fraternity.
The true greatness of California depends
upon the intelligence and patriotism of her
sons and daughters and upon the spirit of
contentment and Industry that permeates the
mass of our people. The white-winged mes
sengers of commerce may bear our products
over every sea, the starry banner of the re
public flash in the morning sun alt around the
globe, but unless sustained by the high char
acter of our citizenship they reflect no glory
on ti." nation.
The historic landmarks of this State, now
fast crumbling to ruin, must be restored and
preserved for the generations which are to
follow in our footsteps.
The magnificent forests and groves of big
trees which cluster upon the flanks of our
mountains must be protected from spoliation;
the waters of the Sierras conserved and dis
tributed to render fruitful our broad valleys
and reclaim the barren plains.
Our home Industries should be fostered, our
manufactories encouraged and the energie" oi
the citizens stimulated and exerted nlong
progressive and expanding lines.
California' e brightest laurels are yet to be
won. No great task can be accomplished, no
great end achieved but through organization,
Vd in the concerted effort springing from the
hearts of tens of thousands of young men of
this State, cemented by fraternity, is the
noblest hope of the West. We are to perpetu

during and living sign and Inspiration, tell
ing to the whole world of the work of the
California pioneers?
It Is not the gold they due from the moun
tain fastnesses nor the bountiful crops they
gathered from the valley that marks their great
undertaking â these have come and may pass
away â but It Is this great commonwealth which
holds her position firmly In the Union of States
that speaks with an eloquence grander and
tweeter than the tongue of Demosthenes or the
pen of Milton, of the great epic of the deeds
of California's pioneers. ' Sons and daughters
of California, our duty is not to praise In words;
It is to carry on to perfect completion the great
work that is left to us by our fathers; let the
strong sense of duty and Justice that guided
them In the upbuilding of the State be our
light on the road to the fulfillment of their
hopes.
There are associations so closely allied to this,
celebration in San Jose that interest and de
mand our attention. This gathering: of our
sisters and brothers from the coaÂ«t counties
to this precursor to the launching of the great
battleship. California.- the first of that class of
great Government vessels to bear the name
Is most appropriate and replete with signifi
cance. A great vessel is building, an engino
that assures protection to the right and holds
terrible punishment for the wrongdoer, a struc
ture that resembles in its intricacy and con
struction the essentials of the fabric of the
State. The keel must be well and strongly laid
and each plate must be intact and each rivet
firmly set, else the whole will not sustain the
buffet of wave or the impact of battle. But
fifty years since and our fathers with but little
experience in statecraft were building the
State; to-day their sons are engaged in the
structure of a vast ship, with little practice
In the great undertaking; but like the pioneers,
they are filled with hope In their labor and the
brains that connived her plan and the hands
that are molding her form are as apt and sturdy
as those of the earlier day. Has the Oregon
and her flight to aid our navy on the Atlantic
coast given us any reason to fear the result?
May their handiwork be an honor to us and
may the California, like her great model, our
State, carry the flag in honor as a pledge of
freedom to all the waters of the globe, an as
surance of peace and protection to the just,
and may the times be but few when she finds
occasion to Dour forth wrath upon the heads
of the doers of evil.

No trace of the identity of James E.
Sharp could, be found in this city last
night. His name does not appear in the
directory. J. Everett Sharp, who it was
thought by the New York police might
be the suicide, is alive and well in this

REDDING, Sept. 9.â The . people of De
la Mar fought throughout the day to save
their homes from a forest fire, which
burned north, east and south of the town
and which sprang up about the smelter
which reduces the ore of Captain De La
Mar's Bully Hill mine, at a point twenty
six miles northeast of Redding. Although
seven houses became ignited at different
times, one of them being on fire on four
occasions, the flames were extinguished
in all cases.
This evening danger of De la Mar's de
struction seems to have passed, although
the fire has leaped Squaw Creek and.
fanned by a stiff north breeze, is racing
toward Copper City, a small settlement
four miles south.
Men are on guard at De la Mar. Cap
per City citizens have been warned of the
danger. They will resort to back-firing.
This evening the entire south side of
Town Mountain, near De la Mar, is ono
sheet of flames and illuminates the coun
try for miles around.
"Military March" was the opening num
ber and prepared every one for popular
musical numbers to follow. This popular
programme contained Mendelsshon's over
ture, "Fingal's Cave": Nlcolai's overture.
"Merry Wives of Windsor"; Glazonow's
swinging concert waltz, op. 47; Waldteu
fel's waltz, "A Summer Night"; rich por

that it has been used to excess at tlmen

An order has also been made requiring
that all money sent to patients be placed
in the treasury immediately upon receipt

Judge King, in an impassioned speech,
alluded to President Roosevelt as a
"grand-stand player" and a "colossal
egotist." He said that while Mr. Roose
velt professed to oppose the trusts, he
was doing all he could to promote an
asset currency scheme for the benefit of
the banks. He charged Mr. Roosevelt
with professing religion and doing all
in his power to encourage war and fast

He made a prophecy in which h'e said

London, to provide funds for the operation
of the Shamrock?, has, according to
stories told in the provision trade, been
caught short in lard and ribs. His house
has been a buyer In the markets for near

The power of the Armour and Swift In
terest has been felt for several days. They
control the stock of lard and meats as it
is necessary for their enormous trade.
Short sellers, who have been pounding
the price down for months, have reached
their limit. For nearly a week, the price
has been moving upward, and to-day there
was an advance of nearly $1 a barrel in
pork, 25 to 35 cents in lard, and 25 to 35
cents in short ribs. Lard has advanced
nearly {6 a tierce since the low point in
July and is now selling about $9 per 100
pounds. One-third of the lard stock of
tHe country is held by the SwifVs here.
LJpton bought more than 1,000,000 pounds
of ribs and about its equivalent in lard
to-day and was one of the factors in mak
ing the advance.

rThis is the proposition: You want to fur-

you dislike trading in an out-and-out install-

We offer you the way.
We loan you the money, charging simply

SHEEFSHEAD BAY ENTRIES.
Only four started in the first six furlong
run. The gray horse Gold Scratch was
made an eleven to ten favorite. See got
him away well, leading to the paddock,
where he was passed and defeated with
ease by BI Piloto, the three to one. third
choice. Iras disposed of Piratical for
show honors. Tullett put another winner
over In the six furlong affair next decid
ed. He had the mount on Legal Maxim,
which was played down from threes to
three to two favoritism. - After Dusty
Rhodes had played his string out he won
without effort. Dug Martin came from
far back, beating Dusty Rhodes for the
place.
Another small field went to the post In
the last number, a mile selling run. Da
vid S with Chandler up was a four to
five favorite and. leading throughout, won
handily from Mountebank and The Miller
in 1:40*4.
There was nothinc to It but the favor
ite from the start. Bozeman got the mare
away In front, and she won buckjumplng
from Nellie May and Miss Dividend.
Ike Tullett. on Doris, landed the' five
furlong scramble for 2-year-olds. The
only one to give him an argument at the
close was Eva D. The four to five favorite
Dr. Birdsall displayed regular bush form,
finishing third. A cheap bunch of platers
lined up in the five furlong event which
followed, with Meteora running a three to
two choice.
SA.CRAMENTO, Sept. 9.-As the State
Agricultural Society offered no
special attraction for Admission
day, the attendance at Agricultural Park,
while large was somewhat disappointing.
Favorites captured five of the seven
events decided. Frank Wright, behind
his mare Margaretta, took the special
pace for horses of the 2:12 class. She sold
an even money chofce over the field and
as Jonesa Basler did not seem up to
much, won in two straight heats.
Ben F, the twenty to four favorite, over
the field for the 2:17 pace, stepped the
first heat In 2:10 flat. Miss Georgia, which
forced him out, could go nearly that fast
if paced by an automobile^ â posibly a bit
faster. Even so, Ben made it three
straight and Miss Georgia thrice finished
second. It Is to be regretted Cecil behind
the latter mare did not make his drive
sooner in the last heat or she might have
won. Cuckoo did better In the third than
in anv of the preceding heats.

As there was $3000 and a silver trophy
wagered on the outcome of the match
it was claimed Mr. Plagemann showed a
lack of sportsmanship in not putting his
fortunes to the test on the track.
Dolador, driven by J. O'Kane, went
over the course in 2:29 without a skip.
The Judges then announced him as win
ner of the match.
The first race on the programme, the
three-minute class, was won in straight
heats by M. M. Donnelly's Old Guy,
driven by J. Culcello. The fastest mile
was done in 2:38.
The 2:25 class was won by J. O'Kane's
Sandow after ho had finished fourth in
the second heat. The first heat was won
by Bandow by half a length after a fierce
drive through the stretch with A. F.
Jacobs' Mack. The first half-mile was
negotiated in 1:09%.
Sandow fbroke badly after passing the
quarter-mile pole In the second heat.
Delia McCarthy and Mack then fought it
out to the wire, the former getting the
verdict by a neck. Sandow won the third
heat and the race by a neck from Delia
McCarthy, the latter coming with a rush
in the last eighth which nearly landfed
her a winner.
The 2:30 class was spoiled owing to a
portion of the harness on Victor giving
away Just after the start of the second 1
heat. He had won the first heat easily.
The other starters In the second heat
continued their journey around the cir
cuit. James de la Montanya's Ivy, driven
by J. Cuicello, won easily. "Victor started
in the third heat under protest. He broke
at the quarter and cut no figure in the
race thereafter.

THE matinee races of the Golden
Gate Park Driving Association
held yesterday at Tanforan race
course attracted many friends of the
clever speedway drivers. They also at
tracted many persons interested In the
development of the light harness horse,
which seems gaining In popular favor.
The choicest bit on the programme, the
match race between Edward Aljreltlng
er's Dolador and F. Plagemann's Gen
eral Vallejo, resulted In a walkover for
the former. This was a great disappoint
ment to the spectators, as an exciting
contest was expected. Mr. Plagemann
moved his horse from Tanforan track
at 11 o'clock yesterday on the ground
that he had gone lame. Mr. Plagemann
came in for some sharp criticism from
the spectators. They said he should have
brought out his horse and had him ex

PETER and his Cripples gave the
Seattle tosscrs no rest yesterday.
On both occasions they landed
prod and strong. The score wa* the same
on both occasions â t to S. The men from
The northern climes had a chance In both
contests, but at the last minute they fell
<!own find had to leave the fleld with Just
a run chy and a swell chano* to get the
laurels on each occasion.
It was a good day for the pitchers. The
hot weather was fine for them, and they
worked to a etarjdstill in both struggles.
The afternoon match at Recreation Park
was a dream. Xo errors were committed
and It was a fight from the start to the
finish, with the Cripples a trifle stronger
In every round.
A couple of nice bingles during the
opening period gave the Cripples a run
and put the crowd In a good humor. But
the men who work for Parke Wilson de
veloped a warring streak in the third and
landed on the elusive shoots of Graham
for one, tying up the result and making
the game much morÂ«Â» interesting.
Tho fourth rolled around and brought
the Cripples a little good fortune. Every
man seÂ«med to land hard on the ball, and
to make it easier for them Bill Byers
managed to let one of Carrick's fast
shoots go through him. and when the
had at last ended It was three up
for the Cripples, giving them a lead of
two.
Graham was pood for a few innings,
but in the seventh and the eighth he be
gan to suffer from the old-time wild com
riaint, and this, combined with a few
bases on balls, netted a couple for the
northern men and created a deadlock.
The Cripples made one last stand In the
eighth and were good enough to end the
came. Francks started it off with a hit
l>ast short, and was caught a moment
la tor while trying to steal second. But
1>r. Moskiman came through with one of
Ids good two-bajrgers far away against
the ripht field fence. Then Schwartz
nent out easily, but Murdock landed for
lii'.nther nice double, scoring the M. D.
and ending it all. The score:

a margin of 11 minutes 29 seconds. Mis
tral and Zada were not placed.

Frank A. Bartlett was not able to sail
the- sloop Emilie to her appointed place

Carolis had been a ship's cook. Robert

T-JE opening game of Scottish bowl
ing at the new Oakland bowling
jreen was played yesterday by the
San Francisco Scottish Bowling
Club and the Oakland Scottish
Bowling Club.
The new bowling green, at Twenty-sec
ond avenue and East Fourteenth street, is
in splendid condition for a new one, the
ground being dry. whic\ helps the players.
The game opened at 1:30 in the after
noon and was witnessed by several hun
dred spectators, who were attracted by
the novelty of the game, though it has
been played for hundreds of years in Scot
land. The Scottish bowling has no resem
blance to the common bowling game
played on the alleys; it resembles more
the game of shuffle board or the Scottish
game of curling.
The game Is played with four teams to
a side, four players compoatng a team.
At one end of the rink, which is 12$ feet
long by 20 feet wide, a small white ball
called a jack Is placed, and each player
rolls a ball, which is shaped like an
orange, as near as possible to the jack.
When each player has bowled all his balls
those nearest the Jack are counted bo that
if one team has three balls nearer the jack
than the other side the first team makes
three points, whereas if the other team
has one ball nearer than either of the
three of 4he first balls the first three balls
are counted out and the other side gains
one point. Twenty-one points make a
game.
The opening game was won by the San
Francisco club, the visiting team scoring
84 points against 53 points scored by the
Oakland club.
Electric lights will be placed on the new
green, and in the future the game can
be bowled in the evening as well as the

singles was extremely exciting and al
though Alfonso Bell, the challenger, won
in straight sets, it was close from start
to finish. The score was 6-3, 7-5. 10-S.
Bell played a magnificent game and at
the net was invincible. The first set was
won quite hnndlly by the new champion.
In the second and third sets the great
struggle came. It was evident at the out
set that Freeman was not in the best "of
condition. He appeared to be afraid to
let himself out. He did not play his usual
steady, careful game, but seemed inclined
to win a point or lose It on one stroke.
He was not up to his last year's form,
but Bell showed great Improvement over
his work a year ago. The fact that Free
man about half the time failed to follow
in his service showed that he was a little
afraid to exert himself.
In the second set first one led and then
the other, until Bell finally won. 7-6.
Freeman had a fine chance to win the
third set, but Bell made a beautiful stand
and pulled up from 5-6 and 0-40. The ex
champion needed but one point to win the
set and had three chances to do it.
Freeman weakened perceptibly in the
last two games and Bell annexed them
quite handily. The loser deserves great
crdit for making such a plucky fight, con
sidering his condition and the heat.
In the forenoon Miss May Sutton de
fended her title successfully against her
sister. Miss Florence, the tournament
winner. The champion won three straight
sets, but the leser made a better show
ing against her clever sister than ever
before.
This makes Miss May's third win and
the challenge cup becomes hers for good.
Both players stayed in the back court
and consequently many lengthy and in
teresting exchanges occurred. The little
champion drove to perfection and the few
times she played at the net smashed with
great speed and accuracy. The score was
6-1, 6-3, 6-2.
After the Bell-Freeman match a special
match was arranged between Miss May
Sutton and Clarence Griffin, a promising
youngster. Discussion has been rife as to
whether Miss Sutton could beat
one of the best of the second
class men. Many of the south
erners claim that Miss Sutton can
beat all but about ten men on the coast.
The local men do not agree with them.
The match yesterday gives a line on the
champion's game as compared with the
games put up by the second-class men.
The match was won by Miss May Sut
ton only after three very close sets, con
sequently she can hardly be ranked
among the first ten players. The score
was 6-4, 1-6, 6-4.
Prizes were presented at 9 p. m., after
which a dance was held at the hotel,
winding up one of the most successful
tournaments ever held on the coast.
Color Photography Successful-

LOS ANGELES, Sept. fliâ Mrs. Chris
tina Griffith haa instituted euit for di
vorce against her husband. Colonel Grif
fith J. Griffith, who is charged with hav
ing attempted her life at Santa Monica
last week. The papers were filed at a
late hour last nlsrht. but the fact was
not made public until to-day. Colonel
Griffith is out on ball and to-day being
a legal holiday no action could be taken,
save to serve a restraining order upon
the defendant to prevent his making any
disposition of his property, pending a set
tlement of the suit.
The complaint charges extreme cruelty
extending over a period of about four
years and culminating in the shooting
affair Thursday, September 3. which
nearly coat Mrs. Griffith her life. The
plaintiff applies for the custody of her
rifteen-year-old son Vandell and prays
that Colonel Griffith be required to pay
her alimony in reasonable amount and a
sufficient sum for the support of her son.
As co-defendants in the suit the State
Bank and Trust Company, the Pacific
Art Tile Company and the Eriswalter
Land and Water Company are named in
the complaint. The reason given by the
attorneys of Mrs. Griffith for this action
is that the defendant Is supposed to have
large deposits with the bank and is a con
trolling stockholder in the two companies
named. By making the corporations co
defendants disposition of Colonel Griffith's
property is estopped.
From present indications Mr*. Griffith,
the victim of the shooting affair, will re
cover.
XEW YORK. Sept. 9.-^The examination
of Joseph Waherman. a dealer Jn leaf to
bacco, to-day before United States Com
missioner Ridgeway on a charge of buy
ir.g smuggled tobacco brought out the
fart, if the confeslsons of two sailors ar
rested Monday are to be believed, that
there are a number of tobacco merchants
In New York engaged in illicit traffic In
tobacco.
For many months the treasury agents
have been investigating what they felt
assured was a -well laid conspiracy to
smuggle into New York leaf tobacco
used for wrappers on expensive cigars
and bearing a very high rate of duty. It
can be purchased in Holland for SO cents
a pound and easily disposed of In the
United States for 52 50 per pound. Much
of it is smuggled, it is declared, from The
Netherlands by sailors, particularly the
men in the engir.e and stoke rooms, and
the Federal cQicers have been unable to
get their hanci^ on the receivers or pur
chasers.
Sunday night two treasury officials fol
lowed two sailcprs of the Kocnigen Louise,
giving the riShle-s of Thome and Schoon.
who, they say, delivered smuggled to
bacco to Joseph "Waherman. To-day.
when the three nien were arraigned be
fore the Commissioner, the two sailors
made confessions and testified In behalf
of the Government and against Waher
man. The Commissioner held Waherman
for trial in Jl'.OO bail, which was fur
nished. Waherman oenied the charge and
insisted he -was the victim of circum
stances. The sailors were paroled.
TnOLUiTN-E. S*pt. 9.-The Coroner's
inquest in the case of. Walter J. Browr,
who wai killed In a piatol duel durins
the Labor day celebration, will be re
sumed to-morrow. Some cf the alleged
mystery surrounding the shooting was
cleared up and the theory ot a third
party In the tragedy was exploded when
the Coroner's jury visited the seen* and
found that Bro^n could have received
the fatal shot from Godat.
Godat admits firing three shots at
Brown. The jury will find that Brown
fired the first shot. Mrs. Brown testiaed
to that fact and was corroborated by
other witnesses. District Attorney Ded
rlck has a letter which was given to Mxa
by Gcdat before the shooting. In which
Brown wrote to Godat. who was In Je
rome. Ariz., at the time, that he (Brown)
would kill Godat 11 the latter ever Bet fcot
in California. Brown's body was shipped
to San Jose to-day for burial.

LOS ANGELES. Sept 9.â After having
been sought by detectives for nearly two
Â¦weeks, James Murphy, aged 67 years, who
says he Is a Grand Army of the Republic
man and that he came hero three weeks
ago from Chicago, was arrested to-day
and confessed his guilt to numerous
charges of forgery. When placed under
arrest nearly 100 checks filled out for va
rious amounts and bearing various names
were found on his person. He made no
secret of his guilt, and admitted that he
had passed at least thirty forged checks
within two weeks. The number Is believed
to be larger than that, for Murphy says
he does not remember all the places
where he cashed bogus checks. Most of
the checks passed by him bore what pur
ported to be the signature of Governor
Legrange of the Soldiers' Home. Mur
phy's plan was to buy a small bill of
goods, pay for It with a forged check
and receive the balance in cash.

him that the most energetic measures will

The Minister added that there need be no

SOFIA, Sept. 9.â The Macedonian organ

the insurgents intend to resort to repri

memorandum declares that 6^,000 men,

The memorandum repeats the state
ments recently Issued by the insurgent
general staff in Monastir that the Turks,
instead of fighting the insurgents, have
instituted a general massacre of tho
Christians.
The organizations declare they are is
suing the present memorandum because
they are no longer able to restrain the

the responsibility will rest with the great

WARNING OF REPRISALS.
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 9.â The Navy De
partment has received a cablegram from
Rear Admiral Cotton, dated Beirut, yes
terday, saying that there were no serious
disturbances in Beirut on Monday night.
The situation there is Improving aoid
public feeling is growing . quieter.
The State Department to-day received
two cablegrams from Minister Lelshman
at Constantinople. It was stated at the
department that Leishman threw no new
light on the situation at either Constan
tinople or at Beirut. Some additional in
structions were sent to Minister Lelsh
man to-day, but these went prior to the
receipt of the cablegrams from him. .A
copy of the report received at the Navy
Department from Admiral Cotton relative
to the situation at" Beirut was sent to thÂ«
State Department. ,

Admiral Cotton Reports Quiet Re-
SITUATION IMPROVING.
The signs of insurgent victories are a
few burned blockhouses. The Turkish
victories are Indicated by the number of
villages deserted and burned and the
number of fires still burning on the neigh
boring hills. Vast columns of smoke are
seen in the direction of Neveska.
The Monastir correspondent of the Daily
Mail sends a graphic account of the sick
ening sights he witnessed in the hospi
tals there. The victims of Turkish bru
tality are mostly Greeks and Wellachi
ans. Many women and children had
wounds from Mauser bullets, proving
that they had been inflicted by regular
troops, inasmuch as the Bashi Bazouks
are armed with Martinis.
The stories told by thÂ© victims tended
to. prove the worst accusations against
the Turkish troops of brutalities and mas
sacres.
LONDON, Sept. 10.â A dispatch to the
Times from Monastir, dated September 3,
says a railway journey from Salonica to
Monastir gives a slight idea of the devas

ulation seems to have entirely disap
peared. The crops are lying deserted and

BERLIN, Sept. 9.â A delayed dispatch
from Constantinople to the Lokal An
zeiger (wiilch sometimes prints official
news) says:
Telegraphic consular reports received hero
to-day (Monday) say that the murder of Chris
tians In different raits of Beirut continues.
Disorder prevails and traffic is destroyed.
The consuls also decided to call on Rear
Admiral Cotton for eventual protection of the
foreign consulates, which he later agreed to
furnish. It Is considered that the Americans
could land 500 men. Some Americans. It Is
believed, , have already landed. The American
ships are cleared for action. Oiher warahlpa
are expected.
The German Foreign Office approves of
Admiral Cotton's intention to land a
guard to protect the United States con
sulate in Beirut if necessary, and of his
holding a landing party In readiness to
protect the foreigners there. Neverthe
less the feeling in official quarters over
the appearance of the American ships oft
Beirut appears to be that it complicates
the Turkish situation, "because," it is
asserted, "a new element has been
brought In which acts independently of
the powers, now that the pressure of the
powers is more or less co-ordinated and
the Porte may know what to expect. But
the American action is not easily calcu
lated and will tend to excite the Turkish
Government and add to the perplexities."
Several of the German newspapers,
Â¦fc'hlle rather restrained in their language,
look with distrust upon the presence of
the American warships at Beirut, as like
ly to disturb the Mussulmans. Other pa
pers, however, say it Is not fair to ascribe

t a block a skeleton of a human being
r/iis unearthed, evidently that of a
â¢voman. All the large bones and skull
were in a perfect sta.te of preservation
and it was thought at first that the
Skeleton was evidence of some terrible

Old residents declare, however, that in
â¢he early days the pub'.ic cemetery was

'â¢he principal thoroughfares and residence
portions of the town. From IS4S up to

Oil Tank in Danger Prom Flames
That Sweep Over Thirty-
Acres of Hills
YOUXTVILLE, Sept. 9.â A fire, the ori
pin of which is unknown, broke out in
the hills directly In the rear of the Vet
erans* Home yesterday afternoon at 4
"Â¦'clock. The wind for a short time driv-
Ing the fire directly toward the Home
buildings, fear was felt that the flames
might reach the . 50,000 gallon oil tank
which stands in the rear of the build-

Members of the Home and citizens em
ployed on the place ppent two hours
fighting the fire and finally succeeded In
putting out the flames. Little or no dam
age was done, although the fire spread
over thirty acres of ground.
Fire in Picnic Grounds.
SAN RAFAEL., Sept. 3.â The picnic
grounds and buildings at Schuetzen Park,
near this city, narrowly escaped being
totally destroyed by fire this afternoon.
It was at a time when over 3000 picnick
ers were enjoying themselves, and had It
r.ot been for heroic efforts of some of the
members of Clan Frascr all the large
(.ar.ee paxilion and concession buildings
would have been razed by the flames.
The conflagration was discovered about 3
p. m. and was located upon the hill In the
dry grass and under the dense growth of
oak. After an hour's fighting the flames
were quenched.
PORTLAND, Sept. S.-Ueutenant Colo
i i Charles A. Booth, quartermaster's de
:rtraent. U. S. A., must remain at the
cot or the list of lieutenant colonels for
Â¦ -, ertofl of nve years for allowing irregu
:t:es to exist in his office. The, findings
:. the general court-martial proceedings
;.painst Colonel Booth were made public
::s bmtuIbs by Brlffauier General Fred
rick Funston, commanding the Depart
ment of the Columbia, who reviewed thc
case.
Colonel Booth was Jn charge of rjuar-
I'TRiattfr's stores at Fort Davis. Alaska,
:<nd was tried by general court-martial
I r irregularities in his department. The
j^urt held Booth suilty of tnisnuinage
it and negligence and sentenced him
to r-rnain at the foot of the list of lieu
enant colonels during the rest of his
Mve serviceâ eleven years. General Fun
on. in reviewing the sentence, reduced
;ne time to five years.
Among the ppec'flcations againr-t Colonel
Booth was one concerning the purchase
of Cigars, which it is said were later re
tailed to the officers at greater prices than
were paid the manufacturer for them.
Although Colonel Booth arrived at Van
couver Karracks some months aÂ«o under
*r<cial orders to await the action of a
K*::eral court-martial, he was made an
nfTW-r of the summary court during the
ir.:erim. Perhaps no other recent official

Special D.B] :â¢.-}â¢, to The Cail.
The Bulgarians who were arrested here
on the eve of the anniversary of the Sul
tan's accession have been released.
Sixty battalions of redifs, on a war
footing, are waiting at the different mob
ilization centers in Anatolia, ready to
start at a moment's notice.
The only news from the interior to-day
Is of the severe engagement with a strong
insurgent band which occupied a position
near Lake Anlatovo, in the vilayet of
Constantinople. The fight lasted until
nightfall.
Notwithstanding the large number of
troops concentrated at Adrianople the
regiment of Haminieh cavalry, to which
the Sultan presented colors on September
4, will leave here this evening for Adri
anople. It is alleged that the dispatch
of these troops can have only one mean
ing, namely, massacres in which the
Kurds are destined to play the same part
as the Circassians did during U13 Russo-
Turklsh war.
The Porte intends to concentrate 50,000
to 70,000 troops at Adrianople. It is said
that 2900 insurgents have been surround
ed at Kirk Kilisseh, thirty-two miles
from Adrianople, and official circles here
momentarily expect news of their sur
render or annihilation.
Jt Is considered probable that France
will send warships to Beirut, and her
example Is likely to be followed by other
power? Several of the diplomats here
drew the serious attention of the Porte
on Monday to the situation In Beirut,
demanding that measures be taken to
prevent a further outbreak and insisting
on the recall of the Vali who was in
office when the outbreak occurred.
No further consular dispatches have
been received recently from the vilayets
of European Turkey. It Is be'Jeved here
that the rigorous repression exercised by
the Turks in the vilayet of Monastir will
result In uniting all of the Christians
against the authorities.
Nazim Fasha, Vali of Syria, was or
dered from Damascus to Beirut, where he
arrived yesterday. The Porte announces
that Nazim Pasha was sent to Beirut
with two battalions of troops to take tem
porary charge of affairs there. The Vali
of Beirut, it is announced, has not been
Oprived of his authority, but will "prob
ably remain inactive at his post during
the stay of Xazim Pasha at Beirut."
"While the rioting- was in progress, the
Beirut advices further slate, an appeal
was made to Rear Admiral Cotton to
land marines, but he replied that he could
not intervene in a quarrel among Otto
man subjects.
The foreisn Consuls in Beirut met on
Monday and decided to make serious rep
resentations to the local authorities look
ing- to the preservation of order. They
also dertdpd to telegraph to their respec
tive EmhaFsadors or Ministers in Con
stantinople, demanding the recall of the
incompetent Vail of Beirut and ursine
that warships be sent for the protection
of the Europeans.
COXSTANTJNOPLE, Sopt. D.-Corisu:ar
accounts received here from Beirut total
ly differ from the Turkish Government's
Â¦version of the recent outbreak there.
The Vali of Bofrut was not on board the
I'nited States flagship Brooklyn when the
first brawl occurred, but wan in the coun
try. Contrary to the official version, the
dispatches say the Mussulmans first at
tacked the Christians, and the troops
which intervened sided with the Mussul
mans. One of the pillaged houses be
longed to a French citizen. Though there
has been no further disturbance at Bei
rut since Sunday great uneasiness,
amounting almost to a panic, prevails
among the Christians, many of whom
have left Beirut and sought refuge in
Lebanon.

PORTLAND. Or., Sept. 9.â After wan
dering around the globe for 15 years, for
getting even his birthplace and the names
of his parents, from whom he had been
kidnaped. Marcus Hechtman. now 22
years old, walked Into tlje store of his
father in this city this afternoon to look
at a watch and was recognized by the
aged Jeweler as hl3 long lost Bon, whom
he had long mourned for dead.
Stolen by a wandering troupe of variety
performers when 7 years old, young
Hechtman has been around the world
and it was only by the merest chance
that he came to Portland. The long
years of separation and the constant
change of scenery had gradually oblit
erated all recollection of his life In Port
land. His mother knew him the instant
she saw him. He was identified by a
scar on his chin, as well as by his gen
eral appearance, which the old man de
clares has changed but little. He parted
from the troupe some years ago In Rus
sia.
Heroic Work Alone Saves Valuable
Warehouses and Machinery
From Destruction.
FIRE AT NILES DESTROYS
PROPERTY WORTH $20,000
NILES, Sept. 9. â Fire destroyed the
office, cutting sheds, evaporator, almond
shelter and huller and engine-rooms of
Edward A. Ellsworth's dryer here to
night, valued at $10,000, with $10,000
worth of dried fruit. Ellsworth was
badly burned about the face and left
hand. Only the heroic work of neigh
bors saved two warehouses containing
machinery and fruit valued at $100,000.
No cause is known for the fire. Last
spring 1 an attempt was made to set hay
afire In the barn and a field by un
known parties. It is supposed that this

.^ JOHN DUNCAN'S SONS, Agentt, NEW YORK.An insolvent woman has applied for relief from her
debts in one of the United States courts. Her ap-'
peal, so unusual as to excite general comment, speaks

Thr Governor of Nevada has announced that he will

SO much opposition has been made to the adop
tion of a currency bill at the coming session of
Congress that unless the advocates of the meas
ure be earnest, vigilant and energetic it is more than
likely the plan of reform will have to go over for
another year and then have to be argued all over
again. The plea of the opposition is that the enact
ment of a bill "revolutionizing our currency system
on the eve of a Presidential election" would be folly.
The answer is that no revolutionary legislation is
asked for or desired, and that it will certainly be bet
ter for Congressmen to go before their Constituents
with a record of useful work performed than with
the stigma of neglecting one of the most important
issues of the time.
As Secretary Shaw stated at the Chicago ban
quet a few days ago, the legislation asked for by the
advocates of reform is anything but revolutionary.
It is not even drastic. It relates only to the question

Captain Martin Returns.
Captain of Detectives John Martin re
turned from hia vacation on Tuesday
night and was at Â¦ his desk yesterday
morning. He visited, -New York, Chicago
and Washington, and says he spent a
very p'.easant time In each city. He
thinks, however, there is no place like
the queen city of the golden West.
A RECENT inspection of the registration of
voters in several districts of New York dis
closed the fact that every voter known to be
a Tammany man was duly registered, while a large
number of Republicans and of independents were
not registered. A similar investigation in almost
any American city would disclose similar conditions.
The bosses, whether of Tammany or not, are sure to
get their henchmen registered in time for every
election that comes. They are as ready to act at the
primaries and at the smallest city election as at a
Presidential contest. Too often, however, the class
of voters upon whom a municipality must rely for the
election of honest men to office and for the main
tenance of good government are so indifferent to
their civic duties that they ignore the primaries alto
gether and not infrequently forfeit a right to vote
by failing to register.
The United Republican League has undertaken to
rouse the attention of all voters to the importance of
seeing that they are properly registered, so that
they can take part in the elections to be held in this
city. It is to be hoped the efforts of the league will
be completely successful and that we shall have a
full registration and a thoroughly representative
vote in the bond elections, in the Geary-street Rail
way election and in the municipal election which is to
follow.
For the information of voters the league circular
calls attention to the fact that the last day on which
they can register for the coming elections is Septem
ber 23, and says: "If you were not registered for the
gubernatorial election in November, 1902, or for the
primary election in. August, 1003, or if you have
changed your residence. since your last registration,
you must register now in order to vote at the coming
elections. Citizens who will have resided in this city
one year on November 3 are entitled to register now.
Twenty-onesters who will become of age on or be
fore November 3 are entitled to register now. If
you are registered in any other county in this State
send for a transfer of registration to the County
Clerk of the county in which you formerly resided,
and when received take it to the registration office in
this city. The registration office at the City Hall
(McAllister-street entrance) is open from 8:30 a. m.
to 5 p. m. and from 7:30 p. m. to 9:30 p. m. Go
now. Don't wait until the last few days. It only
takes a few minutes."
While the advice given in the circular runs to
members of all parties, 'and to .voters generally, it
has a special appeal for Republicans, since it is well
known that a neglect of municipal elections is one of
the political offenses to which Republicans are much
more prone than the members oj opposition par
ties. In repeated instances the, failure of Republican
candidates has been due solely to the neglect of Re
publicans to register or to vote. This time the is
sues are of exceptional importance, and every citi
zen should see to it that he assures himself the right
to vote and to vote right on every question that is
to be submitted to the people of San Francisco this
fall. .
WHERE REPUBLICANS PAIL
UPON the announcement of the signing by the
United States and China of the commercial
treaty which opens to our trade the ports of
ZWukden and Tatungtao the London Spectator de
clared the event to be a great triumph for Mr. Hay,
and added: ""It is indeed a crowning proof that he
is one of the ablest and most successful of living
<i;plomatists, or rather of Foreign Ministers."
Profiting by the occasion, the Spectator makes use
of it to present a brief but carefully prepared review
of the work of the Secretary, together with an esti
mate of his rank as a statesman. It is pointed out
that when Great Britain received him as Embassador
from the United States it was believed he would
achieve just such Success as might be expected of a
man of letters sent to serve in a capital where letters
are honored by all classes and where literary distinc
tion is a passport to social and political preferment.
It was with surprise, therefore, that when the
war with Spain broke out and the Embassador was
called upon to deal with difficult problems of diplo
macy British observers saw Mr. Hay develop a ca
pacity and a courage of the highest order.
In reviewing phase of the career of Mr. Hay
the Spectator says that in the face of threats of Eu
ropean intervention from some quarters, and of a
thinly veiled hostility elsewhere, he showed himself
endowed with a wise and comprehensive outlook on
affairs, a diplomatist who could cross swords with
the ablest foreign diplomats and easily hold his own.
It goes on to say: "Instead, as was prophesied, of
the man of letters being puzzled and perturbed by
the task of meeting the finesse and '.iostility of a
dexterous professional diplomacy, Mr. Hay showed
himself at once perfectly self-possessed and able to
parry and thrust in the great game with the utmost
assurance. He showed that should occasion rise
he would know how to meet the bully with firmness,
how to take fulsome declarations of friendship at
their true value, and how to run great apparent risks
without showing a trace of uneasiness."
The British critic attributes much of Mr. Hay's
success' to the training he had during his service as
private secretary to Lincoln during the Civil War,
saying: "It was in such a place and such an at
mosphere of fierce war and fiercer intrigue that the
young Hay watched and shared the serenity with
which Mr. Lincoln faced and came victorious out of
crisis after crisis. * * * After such a training
under such a master Mr. Hay had little to learn. A
shallower man might possibly have unlearned this
great lesson *n,a generation of leisured ease, but fine
spirits are finely touched to fine issues, and the true
steel of Mr. Hay's character was brought by those
terrible years to a. temper which it has never lost."
The great masses of the, American people have not
needed this commendation* of a British critic to
bring to their minds a recognition of the genuine
greatness of the Secretary of State, still it is gratify
ing to have this evidence that his worth is appre
ciated abroad as well as at home. As his duties are
almost exclusively those of a Foreign Minister, his
influence is widely felt, and from the first it has been
a power making for the good of the world and the
maintenance of a peace secured by honesty and fair
dealing among nations as among good men. In
that respect his influence is likely to endure after
he retires from office, so that he will be remembered
among the great Forcign # Ministers of all lands and
of all times who have contributed to the development
of an ideal diplomacy based upon justice and con
ducted with truth and plain speaking.

The charter of San Francisco, article
XVI, section 4, provides:
Any person holding a salaried offlc* under

appointment, who shall, during his term of
office, hold or retain any other salaried office
under the Government of the United States, or

It is clear enough that General Shafter
would not t>e compelled to resign from
the army in order to accept a nomination
for Mayor. When the late Colonel Men
dell, a retired officer of the United States
army, v.as appointed a Commissioner of
the Board of Public Works efforts were
made by the political foes of Mayor Phe
lan to nnd decisions against the validity
of the but such decisions
were not found.
WHAT CHARTER SAYS.
Many 'citizens of San Francisco, among
them Republicans, Democrats and non
partisans, predict that General Shatter
would be elected Mayor if he were nomi
nated for that office by the Republican
convention. General Shafter was recently
placed on the United States army retired
list with the rank of major general. The
grade is high and the emoluments for life
are considerable. The question is ire-
Quantly asked whether he could afford to
terminate his army career In order to
serve the city for a brief period. General
Stoneman resigned from the army to ac
cept thÂ© office of Governor of California,
but after service for four years as chief
executive of thÂ© State Congress restored
to him th* rank and pay which he sur
rendered In order to render himself eligi
ble, beyond all doubt, to the office of
Governor.
It is still an open question whether an
army officer on the retired list car. be
classed as a salaried officer of the Fed
eral Government. Men familiar with the
decisions bearing directly on that point
assert -that thÂ© pay of an oflicer on the
retiied list is a gratuity In the nature of
a pension and is not a salary. Argument
is advanced that General Shafter would
not be required to forfeit Â«this pay which
the Government bestows in order to ac
cept sen-ice under the municipality. It
is contended that the leading decisions
are to I his effect.
Burton will visit the Lower Elbe near
Hamburg and the canals of Northern
France before going home.
We found illustrations throwing light upon
almost every proposition in the rlrer and har
bor works of the United States. Everywhere
In Europe there la a disposition to make in
creased use of the inland . waterways, whether
rivers or canals. The value of these means oÂ£
transportation Is coming to be realized more
and more. In France and Germany and por
tions of Russia' the quantity of freight carried
by water Is increasing more than that carrleJ
by rail. There is a strong movement for the
improvement of the inland waterways and there
is a growing opinion also, though not as potent
or universal, in favor of tolls on the water
ways which are Improved. It would seem that
Europe affords better opportunities than Amer
ica to study the relations between railroads
and waterway transportation because fre
quently a state which Is improving Its river*
and , buildln? canals also owns the railroads.
But for various reasons the field Is not much
better. In some countries the policies adopted
tojyard the twÂ» methods of transportations are
widely different. In others the railways and
waterways are managed by different Govern
ment departments, each trying to make a good
showing, and the competition which arises is
almost as keen as in the United States.
Burton, who is accompanied by Major
F. Mahan, United States engineer corps,
retired, and his secretary, Mr. Floyd, was
received most courteously in the coun
tries through which they passed. Russia
presented Burton a steamer for his trans
portation and Professor Timonoff and
other engineers went with Burton and his
party on the Volga from Tyre to Tsarit
zln, 1660 miles..
Burton spent eleven days on the Volga
and then visited Black Sea harbors, the
Danube and the Upper Elbe. Speaking of
his investigations, which were begun in
June, Burton said;
Congressman Burton, chairman of the
Rivers and Harbors Committee of the
House, who has returned here from hia
inquiry into the river and harbor im
provements in eastern and southern Eu
rope, says this is the only canal project
seriously considered in Europe that com
pares In expense to the proposed Erie
canal improvement. The Rhine-Elbe ca
nal was estimated to cost $60,000,000.
though it is now thought it will cost con
siderably more.

The Examiner fights against the only cold busi
ness policy that is proposed in the matter and de
mands that the taxpayers furnish the capital and pay
the interest, for a business which it also declares
is to be amply able to sustain itself. Arguing to that
end it says, after introducing an imaginary .taxpayer
who objects to making the bonds a lien on the city:
"You won't have to pay it. The road is already pay
ing ?33,ooo a year on the bonded debt the present
owners have placed on it, and gives them from $25,
000 to $35,000 a year in addition, after paying all
operating expenses, repairs and the like. You will
have from $30,000 to $40,000 a year to put into pay
ing off the debt, giving better service, paying better
wages and setting aside a good income for yourself."
The imaginary taxpayer might well answer the
Examiner: "If that is the case, what is the need of
making the bonds a lien on the whole city, or taking
the taxpayers' money at all? If the business is going
to pay such a fine profit, why not place the bonds and
their interest on the road itself, and leave the gen
eral fund of the city free for the purposes of gov
ernment? The city will own the road and run it as
a business, and if it pay its own interest, sinking
fund and running expenses and make a profit* that
will go into the general fund, anyway, or public
ownership may be vindicated by giving those who
use the road a lower fare. If the road would not
pay, and yet were a public necessity, that would be
an argument for making all the taxpayers furnish the
capital. But if it is to pay that is an unanswerable
reason why the bonds should be on the road alone
and not a lien on the city."
If the Examiner's imaginary taxpayer were a man
pf good sense he would make that answer and vote
against bonding the city for a business declared by
its proponents to be capable of supporting itself and
paying a profit besides.
It may be noticed that in the bond proposition
there is no guaranty of separation of accounts. If the
road earn profits there is no provision for keeping
them separate for payment of interest and sinking
fund, nor is there any provision for such accounting
as will let the people know whether there is profit or
loss in operating the road.
It will be observed that everything offered by the
Examiner, so far, directly supports our demand that
the bonds rest on the road and not on the taxpay
ers. Â¦ If the road is to- pay the large profit that is
predicted, it needs no support from the taxpayers. As
for marketing the bonds and getting the money to
enter upon the experiment of public ownership, no
doubt Mr. William Randolph Hearst will buy the
bonds. He is a multi-millionaire and $710,000 is a
mere trifle to him. His paper is sure that the road
is to be a great success, and will earn a large profit,
and he is an advocate of public ownership of all pub
lie utilities, even to the expropriation of coal
mines, and he should put up this money gladly and
take the bonds, based on the road alone. The tax
payers would be glad to get* something from him
more substantial than wind.
If they have to put up $710,000 and its interest un
til maturity, they will have paid $1,420,000 for the
Geary-street road. As it is a business investment its
operation should pay interest on that sum, which is
not profit, but interest on capital. That interest will
amount to $49,700 per annum. So the road must per
petually earn its operating expenses, its repairs and
maintenance and $49,700 a year interest on its cost,
and anything over that may be called profit. It will
be seen that from this cold business view of it the
Examiner's "fine income" becomes a dissolving view,
and perhaps that is the reason why the Hon. William
Randolph Hearst has -not offered to take the bonds.
He is entirely willing to try experiments that cost a
million and a half at the expense of the taxpayers,
but wants to change the subject when it is proposed
that he risk something himself.
We affirm now that unless the bonds are based on
the road .alone, and its accounts are kept as separate
as they would be by a private corporation, the peo
ple will never know whether the road pays expenses
or not. If kept separate, as a business matter, with
out connection or merger with the general or other
funds of the city, the road's success may be known
and judged or its failure exposed and corrected. The
Examiner sees imaginary parties, holding their-im
aginary money in their imaginary fists, ready to lease
the road, if the city fail in running it. That may be
so, but they will be just as ready if the bonds are a
lien on the road and not on the city. But it is not
well to mix prophecy and business. The road, run
as a public utility by the city, may be a success'.
Basing the bonds on the plant only will not hinder
but rather help success by compelling the application
of business principles in its administration. If it be
a failure, making it carry its own bonds will in no
way contribute to that failure. Hence the unintelli-'
gent outgivings of the Examiner so far disclose noth
ing in favor of making the bonds a lien on the city,
but demonstrate the capacity of the property to
carry its own bonds. If the taxpayers are wise they
will have it so. , : J
Now that is juÂ»t what we want to make it, a. cold
business proposition, by making the bonds a lien on
the road only. Unless the road will carry the bonds
it is not a cold business proposition at all, but a
plan to compel the taxpayers of the whole city to
furnish capital to invest in a business which will not
carry its own credit and pay its cost, principal and
interest.
THE Examiner attempt! further discussion o*
the proposition to make the Geary-street Rail
road bonds a lien upon the whole city, and en
titles its latest .effort "A Matter li Cold Business
Policy."

Where the issue at stake is so important, where
the risk of evil resulting from delay is so great,
where the remedy is so simple, it would seem that
Congress might act even on the eve of a Presidential
election. Besides, there is no necessity to wait for
the very eve. A good bill might be passed, at the
extra session before Christmas, put into effect during
the winter and be so beneficially in operation by the
time the campaign opens next fall that no one would
think of making a political issue out of it.
Of the effects of the passage of such a measure as
vhat suggested by him Secretary' Shaw says: "Three
t.iings I know. First, this additional circulation
vould spring into existence almost instantly when
ever and wherever interest rates advanced to the
point of profit. Second, it would as promptly re
tire whenever interest rates became normal. Third, it
would be absolutely safe â as good as the present
national bank issue and with a slight and immaterial
change identical in form and appearanceâ for the
Government, amply protected by the 5 per cent tax,
would underwrite it."
of elasticity, and a, bill designed to provide, that can
be so drawn at to effect no other change whatsoever.
In fact, elasticity might be provided not by enacting
a new law, but by repealing an old one. Thus the
Secretary says: "There is now no statutory prohi
bition against the well-nigh inherent right of banks
to issue circulating notes. This right erfists through
out the United States, but subject to a tax of 10 per
cent per annum. This tax is prohibitory. If
I were given authority to formulate a meas
ure that would provide the requisite elasticity
to our present currency system, ,1 think I
should add "an amendment permitting
banks, with the consent of the Comptroller of the
Currency, to issue a volume of circulating notes equal
to so per cent of their bond-secured circulation, at a
tax of s per cent, the same to be retired at will or by
direction of the Comptroller, by the deposit of an
equal amount of lawful money with any sub-treasury."
Such, then; would be about all the legislation re
quired. To term it revolutionary is not to argue, but
to denounce. If the method suggested by the Secre
tary be objected to, some other method equally
simple and effective could doubtless be devised. The
advocates of elasticity are pledged to no particular
measure. They insist upon nothing but a good bill
and prompt action.'

ADVERTISEMENTS.
THE OCTOBER NUMBER, now on the news-Sands, answers
squarely the question of supremacy among the magazines for woman and
the home. In your selection of a magazine you may choose from two
classes-^those you need and those you read for recreation â or else you take
THE DELINEATOR and combine both. j
If the word "^necessary" is susceptible of a superlative, THE DELINEATOR is beyond
all question the "most necessary" of all the magazines published for Woman. Nine hundred
thousand families proved this to be so last month; and each month brings its new thousands of
members into the ever-growing DELINEATOR FAMILY.
Among the fashions it is the "moft necessary" because it is all the fashion
magazines in one, with their mistakes eliminated â their exaggerations corrected,
and the really successful novelties stamped with the seal of authoritative approval â
for if it is pictured in THE DELINEATOR it is "good form."
It is equally the "most necessary** in the Nursery â in the Sewing-Room â in
the Kitchen â throughout the whole house and out-of-doors in city and in country.
. The partial list of contents below can only hint at the interest underlying every line.
The Evolution of. a Club Woman, by Agnes Surbridge, begins in this number. It is an autobiography and is the
predicted success of the year. J. C. Hemment, the world-famed camera expert, begins one of the most remarkable
series of photographic articles ever presented. They relate to his personal adventures at home and in foreign lands.
The Silent Partner, by Lynn rjoby Meekins; A Florida Cracker, by Virginia Frazer Boyle, are prominent among the
fiction features, while the departments are fuller than usual of the good things, with special interest centering in the chil-
dren's page.
If the "most necessary" of the magazines for Woman is that one which helps most in every
hour of "her" day and brings its after-hour of fascinating leisure-reading when the day is over,
then, surely, "JUST GET THE DELINEATOR." Of your newsdealer or any Butterick
agent at .fifteen cents a copy, or of the publishers, one dollar for an entire year.

The Blrl students of Snell's Seminary

a few minutes every available, man in the
camp was patrolling the hills. Shortly
after the guard had been placed at the

which order was not obeyed. The guard
fired at the figure and started in pursuit,
firing as he ran. As the soldier patsed
the building he was felled by a rock
thrown by a second man. The shooting
aroused other sentinels, who arrived Just

SEATTLE, Sept. 9.â All but ten cars

day, notwithstanding the decision of the
executive committee of the Street Car
Men's Union early this this' morning to
declare a strike. When the- order to
strike was given out this morning a great
majority of the employes ' of the street
railroad company discarded their union
badges and v. : entt6 work' as usual upon
the promise of President Furth that he
would treat with a committee of the men
in an endeavor to reach an amicable ad
justment of the differences. It ia' believed
the effect of this will be the disruption of
the Seattle branch of the Amalgamated
Order of Street Railway Employe's.
The demands made by the union, the
j-efusal of which led to the strike, includ
ed recognition of the union, reinstatement
of all men discharged -by the company

Death Claims Editor W. B. Winn.
BERKELEY. Sept. 9.â W. B. Winn,
editor and proprietor of the Pacific Oil
Reporter, died this evening at his resi
dence, 1927 Haste street. Mr. Winn was
well known In newspaper circles, having
been connected with the San Francisco
press for some years. The cause of death
was inflammation of the ear drum, which
affected the brain. He was unconscious
for two days previous to his death. The
deceased was 45 years old and was a
graduate of Brown University and a
classmate of President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler of the State University. He is
survived by a widow and four children.
Plan a Town for Negroes.
DENVER, Sept. 9.â A special to the Re
publican from Santa Fe, N. M., says the
Blackdon Townsite Company was incor
porated to-day with a capital stock of
$10,000. The purpose Is to establish a
colony of necroes from the Southern
States in Chaves County, the name of the
town to be Blackdon.
With all the extra expenses that the
new year will entail Dr. Allen does not
see how the department Is going to pull
through, and he is for doing something
that will bring In more money. He says:
"The 25-cent apportionment will leave
us a deficit and affect the efficiency of
the department. The charter limits the
apportionment to the schools to 30 cents,
and we have always been getting that
amount. I also understand the charter
makes the 30-cent rate imperative, and I
think we ought to do something to com
pel the Trustees to give It to us. We
cannot afford to injure the schools now."
Thomas Rickard, president of the Town
Trustees, defends the action of the board
by saying that it has always given the
schools all the money needed, to the det
riment of the other departments. The
levy Is limited to 75 cents, so that It
makes It hard to bring the two financial
ends together.
The changing of the levy by the Trus
tees last night so that the High School
will receive 20 cents and the grammar
schools 5 cents, Instead of 23 and 2 cents,
respectively, does not change the situa
tion.
President AVoodson "W. Allen of the
Board of Education is displeased with the
2o-cent apportionment allowed the School
Department by the Town Trustees, and
threatens legal proceedings to compel the
Trustees to make the apportionment 30
cents.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214S Center Street, Sept. 9.
Dr. W. W. Allen Advo
cates Suing- the Town
Trustees.
The Rev. James Curry is short one set
of false teeth and he desires the City
Council to buy him an up-to-date substi
tute to enable him to continue mastica-
U Â°n a letter to the Council he avers that
the city's neglect to fill a hole at a cross
ins is responsible for his toothlessness
and for divers bodily Injuries. The
clergyman, formerly. of the Alden Presby
terian Church, was taking a spin on his
bicycle when he ran into a deep rut and
was sent whizzing. ,: -.-.-:Â¦
So serious were his injuries that he had
to Â«pend ten days in a hospital, and his
teeth He broken, while he worries along
The unique communication of the cleri
cal -ufferer was at once referred to the
Street Committee and funds for doctors
bills and new teeth may yet be forth
coming from the city's exchequer.
In his letter the Rev. Mr. Curry says
the accident occurred on August 7. His
plaint is In part as follows:
While ridlr-K my bicycle on East Twentr
second street my wheel went through an open
ne In the crossing. I was thrown -violently
| upon the cement walk on my face, by which
1 my Jaw was broken; the plate In my mouth
! was also broken, a number of teeth were loos
! ?nÂ«4 and my whole face smashed almost Into
i a jelly, while my entire system received . a
I &C On re acc h o C unt of this I have spent ten days in
a hospital under the care of doctors and den
tists and will be for some time to come.
This la all because of the bad condition of the
crossing for which the city Is responsible. I
feel therefore, that I am entitled to remu
neration for my expenses, loss of time and my
rnjuVi-s and sufferinB- Rather than to bring
suit I prefer to bring the matter before your
honorable body, trusting that a fair settle
ment may be effected. <â¢ ; Â¦_

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
If I've been successful in ehowlng what I
have in mind I have described a forest re
serve for the people of the community in which
It lies. And one of the most striking things
is the popular attitude of the Pacific Coas:
people, and those of California especially, on
the forest reserve question. Their first atti
tude was direct opposition, then suspicion, then
grudging toleration, then 6upport â a perfectly
wonderful change. There Is no other State
where as a whole the sentiment is to strongly
In favor of the reserve as in California.
Professor E. W. Hilgard, dean of the
College of Agriculture, introduced Mr.
Finchot to the audience. The forester
will deliver two lectures at the university
to-morrow, one In the afternoon and one
In the evening.
I have heard complaints about the law which
forbids the exporting of lumber out of the
State In which it was grown. "Well, the an
swer to them is that the Secretary of the In
terior is trying to have the law repealed and
It will be repealed. There is no reason why
the whole country cannot benefit from the
products of the whole.
There is also much talk about the rules to
jrovern the reserve and the men to control it.
Just now there Is a good deal of red tape
about it, but the rules are getting less and
less strict as the Government and the people
are getting to understand each other better.
There is no reason : why settlers should not
have all the dead wood they want to carry oft*,
but they must not Bet flre to the forest. The
way to do is to make separate rules for the
people of every community. It is impossible
to make rules at Washington that will rule all.
Now In this State you have Government re
serves and a national park. A great many
people do not understand the difference be
tween a national park and a reserve. The
park is a museum, the reserve Is a workshop.
Or.e is to be looked at and the other Is to be
worked. ' - : Â» <'
The forest, you must understand, is a great
protection to tl'e water supply of any coun
try. There are people who sa.y the forest does
not affect tl.e water supply. Why, I have
heard men eay it would be a good thing to
cut all the trees down so that they would not
evaporate all the moisture, but we have meas
urements to show that the moisture is con
served.
PROTECTS WATER SUPPLY.
reserve hurts the cheep and cattle Interest la
a mistake. . .. . ,â
Another objection to the reserve is that It
will drive farmers and settlers out of the
country. I don't believe that at all, and, as
I said before, the land should be given ud to
the dominant Industry.
Some fear that power plant* and railroads
will be kept out of the country ar.d develop
ment checked. Now. there is nothing in thÂ»

BERKELEY, Sept. 9.â A dinner at
the Kappa Kappa Gamma soro
rity house Monday night was
made the occasion for the an
nouncement of the engagement
of Miss Irene Strang Hazard and George
T. Gerlinger. Among the young people's

The Question that should always be determined
Js, whÂ£t Is the dominant industry of the coun
try? It H is grazing, protect the grazing in
dustry: if It is mining, protect the mining in
dustry; if it is lumber, protect the firests.
Then, ir.cteed of wiping out any one of the
â¢Â¦Â¦mailer industries, rive them a. chance to ad-
Just therrsel-.es to new conditions. If the sup
ply of grazing is regulated, the r.heep men
will have a sure supply of grass and the quar
nls and murders that take place every year
will be abated. If the Government has con
trol cf the lands they will be kept In good
condition. I have talked to many sheec men
who believe this is the right way to solve the
vrxed question. It appeals to them as logi
cal. Therefore. I eay. the Idea that the forest
We come now to a very Important objection
â that thf mineral Industry of Northern Cali
fornia will be alK/lished by the advent of the
forest reserve. In the first place, the miner
has just as much rieht to work inside the re
rerve. as outside. The only difference Is made
i:i the cases pf mining corporations which re
<;uire a larjre amount of lumber. The forest
r'-sf-rveÂ« will not affect the California miner at
all. Take the cast of the miners in the Black
Hills of Montana. From b'-lng violently op
posed to the reserves they became warm sup
l>orterÂ» of them and! petitioned to have l,0<>i>,-
V.iKi acres added to the original amount. This
was all because they awakanM to the fact that
there were more mineral lands than forests
and that they needed the forests to protect the
water supply.
The objection that has created more difficul
ties- than any other ie that made by the live
stock men. In California you have wisely de
nied the lands to the sheepmen, nut even so.
last year a million sheep and a half-million of
horaca and cattle were grazed on public lands.
3t is not the purpose of the Government, how
ever, to destroy the stockralRing Industry, but
to preserve it against destruction. The sheep
raisers tell us that the grazing of the public
landK is m protection to them, an it destroys
all Inflammable material, but this is not so.
for the danger from fires Is just as great as
ever, 'rfmffll
Another objection is that the reserves will
diminish the taxable value of the property of
the county within which they He. But if the
lands are comrJttfly denuded of their growths
is not their taxable value destroyed also? In
Michigan the Government has been trying to
s-e'1 1,000.000 acres of- land at 1<J cents an
acre. It in burned over and useless. Now, If
it were turned into a reserve and cultivated,
how much KTÂ«iter would be its worth and tax
able value It is the eame in California â some
Ijecrle advocate that flash In the pan policy
without thinkirjt. With the exhaustion of the
supply of timber comes the Inevitable loss. In
Northern California they have their valueless
acre* of chaparral, which can never be of tax
able value unless something is done for It.
These of you who have seen the country
around Mount Shasta have seen an example of
forf-st destruction.
THE MINERAL INDUSTRY.
I am an advocate of crazinjr lands for re
serves because they ought to be used for agri
culture. And I believe that all agricultural
lands inside cf the reserve should be used ex
tlUFively for agricultural purposes.
ICow. oa this matter of the use of public
reserves and tne opposition to them In Cali
fornia. I want to bay that one of the greatest
objections is tfcet in regard to boundaries and
the exchange of lands. In Northern Califor
nia IXuOo.wO acres cf public lands have been
withdrawn and turned into a forest reserve.
tome of this Is suKable for crowths, but a
{,-reat deal is altogether useless. Sow, one
cf the laws regulating the reserves provides
that any man owning land within the reserves
may exchange it for other lands. The provis
ion is a good one. It was i>ut in because the
eettlers had made settlements and spent their
money and they should be reimbursed. But
the law was used by speculators to feather
their own nest*. They owned lands wÂ»thin
the reserves and of course manipulated them
fo they, could get much more valuable lands
in the exchange with the Government. The
railroads, which own laree tracts of these
forest reserve lands, could have made millions
of dollars through this sort of speculating, but
the Government fcas been emart In Its deal
ings with these people and in a recent ex
change with the Sianta re Railroad the cor
poration only got such '.-.â¢'â¢< in eichanp; as
were equivalent in value to those It held.
Again, they say the Government has not
withdrawn lands suitable for reserves. Well,
Â¦where there are such lartre tracts set a*5de it
is impossible to get It all rich land, but on
the whole the Government hae been very care
tul in its elections. It is not a question of
water in these reserve selections. The flre is
the great limiting quality vrith which we
have to deal. The fires have denuded lands
and changed the aspect of the whole land
scape. Ail over California you see large areas
cf chaparral, with only an occasional tre*
ar.d a few burned stumps where once forests
thrived. Thc-se lands can be reforested and
that is why they have been Included in the
leserves. We must remember that the con
t-umption cf the forests is far outstripping
the new growths. I find al.-o that there is at.
Mva that only the lands that once bore timber
s.tp fit for a reserve, but this is not true.
USE OF THE RESERVES.
BERKELEY, Sept. ?.â Olfford Pin
chot, chief forester of the United
States Department of Agricul
ture, lectured before a large
audience in the students' obser
vatory this afternoon on "The Forest Re
serve Policy in California." The Govern
ment's policy, he said, was greatly mis
understood, and it needed all the patience
of its agents to convince the people of its
Importance and efficacy. In the course
of his address he discussed each of the
objections raised Ly those opposed to the
work, saying in part:
On the qutstlon of forest reserves Calif oinla,
I tir.d. is iike a treat tamily divided against
Itself. Southern California Is una-nlmouBly and
aiwavs lor the reserves, and Northern Cali
fornia. Is ojiijosed to them, Â¦with Central Call
iornia lavoriHK them, but r.ot strongly. On
the whole, however, California is as consistent
<n the forestry reserve problem as any State
In ttie Union.
In takins up the question of forest reserve
the Govmunrtit his overlooked the private
interests of the country in favor of the public
pood and In this way opposition of the most
virulent kiirl has been raised. These private
interests have been able often to create a
rpurlcus opposition. 1 have been engaged,
however, in vlsitlns communities where dif
ferences have arisen, some cf them Â»o serious
that I have been warned not to take chances,
but I ha\-e never yet found a case where op
jjusitloa privately backed has long survived a
ciear understanding cf what a reserve really
waa.

Mayor Olney ( 's address, which was a
comprehensive nresentatlon of his views
on municipal Improvement along lines in
which women might have a leading part,
impressed his hearers and gave rise to
much favorable criticism.

clared was the absolute necessity for wom
en's co-operation in this work of civic up
building and he pointed out how much in
fluence the women of the city might ex
ert in that direction. ,
It is this desire of the Mayor that wives
should prevent, as far as possible, their
male relatives, husbands, brothers and
so on, from putting obstacles In the way
of public Improvements. He ran the
gamut of civic needs and made numerous
suggestions touching beautifying streets

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, Sent. 0. â Wheat showed but lit
tle activity at the opening: to-day, and while it
sold higher, influenced by firm cables. It soon
suffered a reaction on favorable advices fr^m
abroad and liberal receipts at primary points
December showed a gain of %@Hc at S2c but
dropped to 81 %c under pressure of the local
selling. The close was firm, with December
%c higher at 82Â»4&S2%c, after having sold
%c higher on the bulge.
The failure of predicted frosts to occur in
the corn belt, tosether with easier cables,
caused a weak start in corn, with local trad
ers liberal sellers. Later in the session the up
turn in wheat, with renewed predictions of
frosts to-night and excessive rains, started
prices upward and the close was firm with
December at 51%c. having sold up from 50Vc
Oats were very steady, although responding
In some degree to the early slump In other
grains. Commission houses were free buyers
at times. December closed %c higher at
37%e.
The demand for provisions was exceedingly
active and prices showed a good advance
throughout the list. Investment buying in
October pork at one time sent that product up
nearly $1 over yesterday's close. Final sales

NEW YORK. Sept. 0.â The stock market j
opened dull and leas Interesting than at any j
time for the past fortnight. The price move
menta were narrow and without meaning, in Â¦
Tact the market as a whole was devoid of epc- ;
cial feature and operations almost professional.
There was no pressure to sell, neither was
there even a semblance of investment demand. 1
Traders were "on the fence," committed to ;
neither side, but rather hoperul of a rally. Tha
news of the day was not of an encouraging
character. Aside from the Increasing serious
ness of affairs In Eastern Europe, which
brought about a further decline in British con
sols, the decision of Umpire \Vright, favoring 1
the hard coal operators, and reports of a prob- j
able strike among the Colorado coal miners I
were quite sufficient to check any trading that !
might otherwise have developed. The banks
continue to lose currency heavily to the lnte
rlor. Several large shipments were made west
and south to-day, indications pointing to a
heavy week's movement, in excess, perhaps,
of that reported a week ago. The banks ex
plain this movement as perfectly natural and
tending to continue in large volume from now
on. These shipments were partially offset,
however, by the release at this center of *1,
602,000 on account of Australian gold deposited
at San Francisco. This money was paid out I
at the subtreasury and was Immediately added I
to local bank reserves. The rates for foreign |
exchange were practically unchanged from
those of yesterday. The demand for remit
tance bills was email and offerings were mod
erate. .The day's business was limited to the
better known railway shares and the tractions.
the latter showing marked strength. The act
ive Issues were the Pacifies. Atchison, St. Paul,
New York Central, Reading, Pennsylvania,
Rock Island, Southern Railway, Erie and
Amalgamated Copper. The coalers made no re
sponse to the decision 1 already referred to.
Metropolitan Street Railway advanced 2%,
Metropolitan Securities 2% and Manhattan 1%.
Brooklyn Transit recovered from its early heav
iness. There was practically no market in the
early afternoon, but in the last hour short cov
ering Indicated tha^ the market had been over
sold and prices were bid up with some degree
of success. This move seemed to be purely
technical, however, although there was an im
pression in seme quarters that offerings were
being quietly absorbed. The closing was
steady. The crop situation developed no fea
tures. Railroad returns show Increases In gross
on thirty-four out of thirty-eight reads, the
average Increase being 10.58 per cent.
The bond market was quiet, and after early
heaviness rallied slightly and closed irregular.
, Total sales (par value), $928,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on last
call.

SAN JOSE, Sept. 9.â The fruit growers
of this county expect a lot of trouble may
arise over the Interpretation and enforce
ment of the bill passed by the last Leg
islature, the object of which was to pre
vent fraud in the branding of fruit, the
requirement being that all picked fruit
must bear a label showing where it was
grown and packed. The packers claim
that they cannot take fruit from differ
ent sections of this district and make
separa: Jabels. The Cured Fruit Asso
cia.t!o;; classed Hdiister, for instance, as
of Sar.ia Clara Valley, and the point has
arisen whether or not Hollister fruit must
be branded as Hollister or Santa Ciara.
New Law May Cause Trouble.

othy O'Leary, each of whom read original

joyable feature of the exercises. In which
Miss Loietta Barr, Miss C. Barrett, M. J.
Connolly, P. O'Looney and M. Holland
took Dart.
While jollying along the merry prim- j
rose path and daily topping the high
places, George D. Allman evidently reck-,
oned without his host. , !
He seemed to forget that bankers kept j
a balance sheet and with this forgetful- ;
ness uppermost he drew checks with a I
prodigality that was as pleasing to him
self as it was distasteful to his friends.
Now a little matter of writing a check for
$20 or $25 was a simple thing to do, and
a very easy feat to hand to a friend and
get the cash value thereon, but it was not
such an easy matter for the holder of thÂ«
check to extract the money from the Ne- Â¦
vada National Bank when there was no
money in that bank to meet that par
ticular obligation.
Among the hapless owners of some of
these checks happen to be A. G. Hage
dorn and Gender & Hlnk. They, luckily
for Allman, are not Inclined to press the I
collection of their worthless checks, so up â¢
to the present no action has been taken.
Allman is, however, under bonds to the
United States Fidelity and Guarantee
Company, whose agents claim that they
have got to make good to the Government
something like $3500 â which Allman is re
ported to owe the Government on account
of aefaulting to carrying out mail con
tracts he entered Into in the northern part
of the State. What the upshot of the
matter will be is hard to tell, but rumor
has it that some wealthy relatives across
the bay have promised to come to the
rescue and arrange a settlement of the .
matter. ,
Seated on his work table, with his legs
crossed tailorwlse and his glazed eyes
fixed vacantly, into space, Leonard Lip
pert. tailor, was found dead yesterday
morning In his shop at 416^4 Montgomery
avenue. The body was in a natural posi
tion, the back resting against the wall.
The discovery was made by M. Baldoc
chi and Joseph Padilla. who have a shop
next door. They emelled the odor of il
luminating gas proceeding from Lippert's
Place and notified Policeman P. J. Keys,
who forced an entrance. Llpperfs body
was cold and rigid, and it was evident
that he had been dead for many hours.
Gas was escaping from a half-opened
valve of the gas fixture on the wall near
by. In the dead man's pocket was found
52 40. and his bunch of keys lay on the
table. This was about all the money
that he had when he left home at noon
on Tuesday, since when he had not seen
any of his relatives. He had been drink
ing to excess, and death is believed to
have beÂ«n accidental. Lippert was a na
tive of Germany and was 75 years of age.
He resided at 512 Greenwich street with
his family.

ThÂ«Â» lax manner in which the Fourth
street drawbridge is being managed haa
been a source of serious complaint for
Â«mÂ» time past, but the admonition to
CO kick to Michael Casey" Is all the
-lUsfaction so far obtained by the ship
pners and others Inconvenienced. The
r...ge was two hours late In being opened
resterday morning, in spitÂ« of the fact
nat the schooner Queen was waiting to
r^t out and in the afternoon an hour's
â¢ardJness In opening the bridge almost
:aused the schooners John A a.nU Dauni
tm to miss the tide.
Protests to the bridgeman avail noth
"'g. He cpens the bridge when bo dis
posed and is said to have threatened sev
eral protcstants with personal violence.
"If you don't like way this bridge
* run make your to Casey. Don't
>other me."
This is the most sa. action any of the
fufTero-rs have received and meanwhile

"We have all been regaled with the unlikely tale
Of the tree and the ax and the lad,
And were told It so oft that at times we would rail,
For we knew there waa ne'er such a dad.
But this isn't young George, and the 6ketch Is to enow
That a small ax may fell a great tree.
And so also a small ad â when It's placed right, you know â
Draws attention surprising to see.
In The Call's the right place, you'll hear every one say
Who has ever availed of Its aid,

the city from Menlo Park on August 30
and fell asleep in a doorway in Howard
court. When he awoke he discovered
that 65 cents and two baggage checks had
been stolen from his pockets. The follow
ing day the checks were presented at the
baggage-room at Third and Townsend
streets and the articles taken away. The
police were notified, and Peter Enrlght
was arrested by Detectives Regan and
O'Connell and Identified as the man who
presented the baggage checks. He was
booked at the City Prison yesterday on a
charge of grand larceny.
Bobbed While Asleep.
Brock is known as an Eastern bunko
man, and It is supposed that Maloney
had Induced him to come here with him.
The police have Information that Brock
was arrested in New Orleans, but that
is all they know about him.
Maloney is a well-known bunko man
and is wanted on a charge of grand lar
ceny for tricking Charles Nelson, a tan
ner, out of $115 in a room at 34 Ellis
street on May 22 last He left this city
at that time and had apparently Just re
turned. He has served a term of seven
years for grand larceny in Seattle. The

John Mahoney, and David Brock were

1UNK0 MEN ARRESTED
WITH VICTIM IN TOW
A horrible sight met the eyes of Annie
Balser, housemaid in the King's Daugh
ters' Home, 317 Francisco street, when
she entered the room of one of the Inmates
last Tuesday morning and found aged
Charles P. Smith lying on the bed with
his throat cut and weltering In his gore.
She ran screaming from the room and a
surgeon was sent for, who dressed the
wound. Owing' to the hemorrhage and
his advanced ageâ S2 yearsâ Smith died
yesterday forenoon. A bloody razor and
a penknife, with which the wounds had
been inflicted, were found on the bed.
Smith had been an Inmate of the home
for about ten years, during which he had
been a Bufferer from rheumatism and pa
ralysis. He became despondent recently,
and without doubt he had meditated sui
cide for a long time. He was a native of
Denmark.

The patronage of the circus is deserved,
for the programme is splendid. Ringling
Bros, are not set in a groove and they
present many novelties. The Nelson fam
ily, famous acrobats, are the headliners
of the show and without doubt they are
the greatest in their line. The bareback
riders make daring acts and their dash
ing leaps to the backs of galloping horses
are watched with suspense.
Captain Webb's performing seals are
wonderful and their tossing and balanc
ing of a ball put the slippery fingers of
many baseball players to shame. The
opening spectacle of the Crusaders Is well
arranged, the tableaus are full of color
and all the participants In the act are
handsomely costumed. The menagerie is
both Interesting and instructive. The
greatest attraction is a tigress with six
cubs a month old. The giraffe has much
fun watching the crowd, and with his
head peering out far over the "* cage he
Is a typical specimen for the cartoonist.
There are two performances, one at 2
p. m. and one at 8 p. m.
Twelve thousand people attended the
performance of Ringling Bros.' circus last
evening. Every reserved seat was sold
early In the day and by 8 o'clock last
night hundreds of people were turned
away.
Thousands suffer from a short, hacking cough
who might bo cured by Ptso'a Cure. â¢
Programme Is Full of
Clever and Daring
Acts.
Mrs. Loo Lin Admitted.
MONTREAL, Sept. 9.â Owing to the ef
forts of Miss Clark of New York, Mrs.
Loo Lin, the Chinese school teacher, wife
of a New York restaurant keeper, who
wa? detained at San Francisco by order
rf the United States Immigration authori
ties and brought in bond to Montreal, will
be entitled to go to New York in a few
dayg, having obtained the requisite pass
port.
June 6 was the only day this year when
it was warmer than yesterday. â¢ The tem
perature on the former occasion was %
degrees Fahrenheit. The mercury fell
twenty degrees yesterday from the max
imum in a period of three hours, and the
weather last night was of the bnimy
character which makes California famous
the world over.
Professor McAdie of the Weather Bu
reau has compiled statistics from the of
ficial reports showing that there have
been but eleven days In San Francisco
during the summer months of the last
thirty years when the temperature has
risen higher than 90 degrees Fahrenheit.
The cause of yesterday's heat is trace
able, according to McAdie, to the exist
ence of an area of high pressure over
Oregon and Nevada. The heat in the in
terior of the State was intense yesterday,
although no records were broken. More
warm weather is scheduled for to-day.
Professor McAdie said yesterday:
"There is nothing like .San Francisco
weather anywhere else in the world. I
foresee that as the population of the
United States Increases this city will be
come more and more popular as a sum
mer resort. It is never very hot for any
length of time, and we know nothing of
the cold weather. which* makes life in the
East so uncomfortable during the wln-f
ter. San Francisco's weather Is bound to
make her greater and richer than if she
had within her boundaries the greatest
gold mines in the world."
A genuine hot wave struck San Fran
cisco yesterday, and although it did not
tarry long on its way Into the Pacific. It
made Itself generally appreciated. The
mercury stood at 64 degrees Fahrenheit
in the early morning and rose very grad
ually. About noon it began to be hot in
earnest, and at 1:20 o'clock p. m. the ther
mometers registered 92 degrees in the
shade.
Rabbi Jacob Voorsanger was the guest
of honor at a banquet tendered him last
evening by 200 prominent Jewish citizens,
who desired to express their appreciation
of his completion of thirty years' work
for the cause of Judaism.
The hosts of the banquet are members
of the Independent Order of B'nai B'rlth,
of which Rev. Dr. Voorsanger Is a dis
tinguished leader. The banquet was given
at a downtown restaurant and an elab
orate menu was In evidence.
Max Popper acted as toastmaster, and
in a brief speech he tendered a welcome
to the guest of the evening. D. S. Hirsh
berg proposed the toast "Our Guest" and
delivered a eulogy on the career of Dr.
Voorsanger, whom he designated as a
"God-appointed leader of Israel." The
speaker dwelt upon the broad views of
the rabbi and his earnest efforts to as
similate the religion of the Jew and har
monize all points of doctrine with Amer
ican citizenship.
On behalf of the members of B nai
B'rlth Mr. Hirshberg then presented Dr.
Voorsanger a massive gold goblet, suit
ably engraved. In delivering his response
Dr. Voorsanger was visibly affected, and
he assured his hearers that he would ever
cherish the kindly feelings that had
prompted the banquet and presentation.
The rabbi spoke eloquently ' of the ad
vance of Judaism in America, and said
his life's efforts had been and would al
ways be devoted to the end to put thor
ough Jewish sentiment Into Americanism
and to teach that the narrow environ
ments of the past must give way to the
broad progress of the present, thus bene
fiting religion and citizenship.
Toasts were also delivered by Wallace
A. Wise, Rev. M. S. Levy, E. Myron
Wolf, George Samuels, Otto Irving Wise,
Rev. M. Friedlander, Marcus Rossnthal
and H. Gutstadt.

the destroyed mill will be done without
delay.
Truck No. 2, while drawing up at the
scene of the fire, was overturned by the
rear. wheels coming In contact with a
heavy timber and the driver and tillerman
were thrown to the ground. They escaped
with a few bruises. A Chinese workman
named Ah Jim, employed at the chemi
cal works, was burned on the right side
cf the face and was sent to the Harbor
Emergency Hospital for treatment. The
four-story salsoda and cream of tartar
works adjoining the sulphur mill escaped
injury owing to the splendid work of the
Fire Department.

A disastrous fire occurred yesterday
morning at half-past 7 at the sulphur re
fining and whiting plant of theStauffer
Chemical Company, Pay and Dupont
streets. It resulted in the total loss of a
two-story brick and wooden building, the
estimated damage being $30,000.
The fire started in the sulphur grinding
mill, and Is supposed to have been caused
by sparks generated by a piece of flint
being crushed by the rapidly revolving
rollers. The flames spread rapidly, and
when the Fire Department arrived the
entire building was a mass of flames. A
second alarm was sent in by Acting Chief
Dougherty and a dozen engines and a
water tower were engaged for more than
an hour in fighting the fire.
Owing to the dense sulphur fumes the
firemen were compelled to work at some
distance from the building. Fifty tons of
sulphur and a large quantity of whiting
were destroyed by the flames and water.

Captain McCann thanked the members
most heartily for their kindness and said
that the surprise was so great that he
could scarcely find words to show his full
appreciation of the gift bestowed upon
him.
The sword is a magnificent piece of
work, being made up by Litchfleld.
The committee having the "evening at
home" in charge was composed of the
following: Privates- Frank D. O'Keefe,
Fred Postel, Henry Schmidt, Robert El

a success throughout.
Lieutenant William V. Johnson made
the presentation speech, In the course of
which he outlined the splendid work per
formed by Captain McCann in bringing
the company up to the high standard that
it holds. This was made notable by the
fact that when Captain McCann first took
charge of the company one year ago It
was almost on the verge of disbanding

Hubbard was charged at the Hall of
JuKtice with assault to commit murder.
His story, in so far as the shooting is
concerned, was corroborated by several
witnesses, who, however, could not fur
nish a description of the man who had as
sailed him, and the police also failed to
find any trace of the man who had fled.
At The Oaks it was denied that a man
named Hubbard was a lodger there, but
the prisoner still Insists that he has a
room there.
Dr. Kergan said that he and his wife
hi^d been to the theater and were about
to board a car for the ferry when he
heard the report of a pistol and was
Ftartled when his wife suddenly shrieked
and fell to the ttreet.
The woman, who proved to be Mrs.
Katherine Kergan, wife of Dr. W. W.
Kergan, living at 957 Eighth street, Oak
land, was hurriedly carried by her hus
band into the entrance of the Phelan
building, where she expressed a doubt as
to whether fhe had been hit by the stray
shot, tut complained that the lower por
tion of her body was numb. A carriage
was called and in company with her hus
band and Officer Driscoll. Mrs. Kergan
wa& conveyed to the home of Dr. J. B.
Kergan, 22$ Hyde street, where an exam
ination developed that she had been
wounded slightly in the right thigh. Later
she was conveyed to her home in Oak
land.
As the woman fell several person* rush
r-d to her and as they did so one of two
men who had been quarreling near the
rurb on the south slda of Market street,
suddenly ran up Market street to
ward Fourth and the other, turn
ing, darted into Becker & Hender
son's saloon, a few doors below where
they had been standing. He ran to the
rear of the saloon. wh<>re he was over
hauled by Becker, who immediately turn
ed ' him over to Police Officers Daniel
Drisccll and Michael Farrell.
To the police the prisoner gave his
name as C. T. Hubbard and said he was
< mployed as a telegraph operator by the
Southern Pacific Company at' Selma, but
l:ad been visiting the city for a few days
and was staying at The Oaks on Third
street. Regarding his share in the shoot
ing affair Hubbard, who is about twenty
f'jur years of age, said:
I had been to the Alcazar Theater and was
n turning to my lodging*. Coming Cown
O Terrell street, I crossed , Market at Grant
avenue and was proceeding on my way along
the nou;h eicie of Vurket when a etranger
puddpnly accepted me. He made several in
euitlns-n-inarks about my -clothee, to which I
responded, 8-nd lie then turned and hit me on
the raouta with his list. I quickly recovered
Jrom the effects of the blow and drawing my
pistol nred a shot at him. When he saw me
reach lor thu he bee^-n to run and was
soon out of elKtit. 1 do not know who the
feliow was juid I doubt If I could positively
identify him If we met again.
The sharp report of a pistol, followed
by the shrieks of a woman, who, a sec
ond later was eeen to totter and fall in
the middle of Market street, just oppo
site Grant avenue, startled the pedestri
ans on the big thoroughfare shortly be
fore 11 o'clock last night and for a time
<aused them to believe that a murder
had been committed.
E. F. HeaJy, a newspaper man living
at 8390 Twenty-third street, reports that
a tall and a short footpad hold him up
shortly after 1 o'clock yesterday morning
while he was on his way home and re
lieved him of $6 SO, all the money he had
in his pockets. He had reached Clinton
Park and Valencia street when the
taller of the two footpads, who was
masked, pointed a revolver at his head
and ordered him to throw up his hands.
He promptly obeyed and the smaller of
the two deftly went through hla pock
ets, extracting his coin. Then lie was
told to go about his business. Shortly
after the hold-up he met Policemen Pow
ell and Coulter and notified them. They
made a search of the neighborhood, but
could find no trace of the footpads. One
is described as about 5 feet 9 inches tall
and the other about 5 feet 5 inches.
Detectives Dlnan and Wren have not
yet succeeded In arresting the two foot
pads who operated at 252 O'Farrell street
on Tuesday afternoon. They are satis
fled that the footpads are addicted to the
same vice as the men who were robbed
and that they knew each other. The vic
tims, who are known as "dope fiends,"
told the detectives that if thev made any
arrests they would not prosecute the case.
The arrests -will, however, be made.
John Smith and Dennis O'Brien, who
are supposed to be the two footpads who
held up John Bohner, 300 Turk street,
and his patrons; John Sere, Seventh and
Natoma streets, and his patrons, and
Henry Elmers, 1345 Sacramento street,
were booked at the City Prison yesterday
on a charge of robbery, following the
identification of Smith by Elmers as one
of the two footpads who robbed him in
his store. Owinie to the fact that the
footpads wore masks none of the other
victims have been able to identify them.
John Smith and Dennis O'Brien, who
were arrested last week by Detectives
Dlnan and Wren, are not the only tall
and short footpads who are optrating in
this city together. There were the tall
and the short men who held up several
people In Golden Gate Park and a man
at Bush and Polk streets last Friday
night.

Miss Agnes Miller, o! Chicago,
speaks to young women about
dangers of the Menstrual Period
â how they can avoid pain,
suffering and remove the cause.
" I suffered for 6ix years with dys-
menorrhea (painful periods), so much so
that I dreaded every month, as I knew
it zae&nt three or four days of intense
pain. The doctor said this rras due
to an inflamed condition of the uterine
appendages caused by repeated and
neglected colds and feet wetting.
"If youns girls only realized hoir
dangerous it is to take cold . at this
critical time, much suffering would be
spared them. Thank God for Lydia
E. PinJcliam's Vegetable Com-
pound* that was the only medicine
which helped me any. Within three
weeks after I started to take it, I
noticed a marked improvement in my
general health, and at the time of my
next monthly period the pain had
diminished considerably. I kept up
the treatment and was cured a month
later. I am like another person sinca
I am in perfect health."â Miss Agsks
