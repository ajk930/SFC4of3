ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 25.
â The' Russian Government is
still considering the reply of the
Japanese Government to its note
which was sent in answer to
Japan's demands relating to the
situation in the Orient. A recon
sideration of the proposals made
in the Russian note is considered
as a matter of course here. Rus
sia has never been disposed to
take any step which would lead to
an abrupt termination of the ne
gotiations with Japan: ~ *" - 'Â¦*~~
In answer to inquiries the Rus
sian Foreign Office has always in
sisted that the Russian proposals
were so liberal that it would be
scarcely probable to conceive any
further concessions. While the
Foreign Office is unwilling to ad
mit that Russia is prepared to of
fer more than the concessions out
lined in the last note, it is consid
ered possible that the Government
may suggest changes by which the
Russian requirements may be met
and satisfaction given to Japan.
A rumor has been circulated
here that the United States Gov
ernment is still inclined to suggest
the reference of the difficulties
between Russia and Japan to The
Hague arbitration tribunal, but
this rumor is believed to be mere
ly the echo of a former sugges
tion made ,in the press of the
United States.
TOK1O. Dec. 25.â At a din
ner given by the Oriental Associa
tion to-ni^ht Former Minister
Kato, who presided, said he deep
ly regretted that the people had
. not been taken into the confidence
of the Government regarding the
position of affairs between Japan
and Russia. Nevertheless, he
said, should the Emperor declare
war, the nation would be found
ready to give him unanimous sup
"port.
Count Okuma, the former Pre
mier, said he agreed with the view
expressed by Mr. Kato, and he
thought it was now high time to
let the people know the actual
position occupied by the Govern
ment. He also declared that not
only a feeling of chivalry but a
desire for self-preservation rc
; quired that Japan should buttress
the integrity of China. Both
speakers thought that the situa
tion had' reached an extremely
critical stage.
The officers protected themselves as
best they could, but were finally fprced
to retreat. The victorious women then
marched tip the road singing in Italian
a song of victory.
Later the guards returned with rein
forcements and succeeded in evicting
the strikers without further resistance.
The striking miners took no part in
the disturbance and urged the women
to desist.
On the last day of the month the
work of evicting the married strikers
will commence. The Utah Fuel Com
pany officials declare that they expect
serious trouble at that date, but the
union leaders declare that the strikers
will make no resistance not author
ized by law.
SALT LAKE CITY, Utah, Dec. 23.â j
A mob of angry women attacked a

The deputy sheriffs in the employ of

to be made upon the site of the dam."
In order to place themselves on rec

do not recognize that the Government
in the constructic/n of the dam should,
without requesting bids from cement
manufacturers for the cement to be
supplied, proceed to construct, and ope
rate a cement works as part of the
construction of the dam, such works
and operation of the same 'being no
part of that which would be called for
in bids for the construction of the dam
or materials entering therein." ;
They add that it is a source of grati

would cost at this dam arose from the
excessive cost of and
not from excessive factory price of the

EDNA, Kan., Dec. 25. â Arctic Ex
plorer Evelyn Briggs Baldwin, who is
visiting his father. Colonel E. B. Bald
win of this place, has just received an
original message which he himself dis
patched by balloon within ten degrees
of the north pole in June, 1902. The
message was one of twenty, each
contained within a copper tube inserted
within a cork buoy.
The. twenty buoys were suspended to
the balloon, one beneath another, in
such a manner that as the buoys in
turn touched the surface of the earth
following the gradual escape of the gus
from the balloon, each was released by
means of an automatic device. The
buoy which contained the message
which Baldwin has just received was
picked ur> at sea November 12, 1003,
near Skotningberg, Finmark, Norway,
near North Cape. The buoy was in
good condition after its voyage of near
ly seventeen months by air, ice and
water, fn May, 1903, one of these buoyj
containing a message in excellent con
dition, eleven months after its dispatch
from Franz Josef Land, June 11, 1902,
was picked up on the northeast coast
of Iceland.
Had the; Baldwin-Zeigler expedition
not returned in the autumn of 1902, es
pecially after the failure of Zeigler's
private secretary to reach Frnnz Josef
Land, with the supply ship that same
sumner, the significance of these dis
patches d>* balloon would have been
well understood by the public months
ago. In the message just received the

â¢ Joseph B. Crockett, for many years
president of the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company and one of the
best known business men of the city,
passed away at the home of his
daughter, Mrs. Laurance Scott, at
San Mateo on Thursday evening. Mr.
Crockett had been a sufferer from
heart trouble for many years and it
was that malady that ended his life.
Mr. Crockett resided in Burlingame
for many years and several days ago
went to his daughter's home at San
Mateo^to pay her a visit. He was
tak.en 'ill there and was too weak to
be removed. He failed to rally and
passed away peacefully on Thursday
evening. The funeral services will
take placeÂ»from Grace M. E. Church
at 11:30 o'clock this morning.
â¢ Mr. Crockett was a native of St.
Louis and at the time of his death was
53 years of age. He came to Califor
nia when yet a young man and was
made engineer of the old City Gas
Ccmpany. He gradually rose from
that position and still remained with
the concern when it became the San
Francisco Gas Company.
When that concern merged into the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany about ten years ago, Mr. Crock
ett was retained and made president
of the concern. He resigned about
two years ago on account of ill health
and since then has not taken an ac
tive part in business affairs. Mr.
Crockett Is survived by his wife, one
daughter and three sisters.
Evidences of a Becond murder have

The aqgument points out that if the
department undertakes to manufacture
its own cement, there will be no se
curity or bonds provided and no pun
ishment, in case of failure, except the
possible discharge of an incompetent
superintendent..
By far the most important part of the
argument is devoted to a consideration
of the legal questions involved, the
manufacturers* maintaining that: "It
is certainly no part of the Govern
ment's duty to enter into the manufac
ture of -any class of commodities. If
the Government can erect cement
plants to avoid the cost of railroad
transportation, middlemen's profits
and manufacturers' profits," says the
argument, "it la its duty to erect miil3
for the manufacture of blanket's,
clothing, shoes, . etc., worn by its'sol
diers and sailors, to manufacture iron
for its building construction, to oper
ate mines for its gold and silver cur
rency, etc."
The m:," "facturers contend that "in
no case should the Government enter
into any competition with the general
public." The manufacturers therefore
submit a proposition that the Govern
ment advertise for bids for Portland
cement of known character and sub
ject to definite specifications and un
der definite requirements for security,
and that such bids should recite "that
on the site of the dam materials of
such chemical analysis are to be found
as are believed to be suitable for the
manufacture of cement; that the Gov
ernment is the owner of a cement plant
of a character to be described and will
furnish electrical power free to the bid
der, and that all bidders may bid upon
WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec. 25.â The
Association of Portland Cement Manu
facturers representing a large percent
age of the $350,000,000 of capital investsd
in this industry has presented to Secre
tary of the Interior E. A. Hitchcock
an argument against the manufacture
of cement by the Government, to btr
used in the construction of the Tonto
Basin dam In Arizona. This dam will
be 247 feet above foundation, with 190
feet available storage, and a capacity
ofS40,000 acre feet, covering 9000 acres
of public land, 4400 of unimproved
private land, and 740 acres of cultivat
ed land. As the principle is the same
as will be involved in the furnishing of
cement for the Idaho, Washington,
Milk River, Montana. Colorado River,
Gunnison, Colorado, Sweet River,
Wyoming and the Hondo, New Mexico,
irrigation projects for which over $16,
000,000 is already available, derived
from the sale of public land, the cement
manufacturers are very desirous that
the Government should not go into the
business of manufacturing cement, in
competition with private enterprises.
The argument presented to .the Secre
tary reviews the history of the'develop
ment of the American Portland Cement
industryâ one of a continuous struggle
to produce in this country a material,
tha demand for which is dependent
upon its reputation. The manufacture
of American cement was begun in the
smallest possible way, it is claimed,
and it was only after it had been used
to the satisfaction of the engineers
that the early manufacturers were able
to demonstrate beyond cavil that
American cement was equal to trÂ« im
ported. The manufacturers therefore
contend that in the proposition to man
ufacture , in the Tonto Basin 200.000
barrels of cement to be used in the con
struction of the greatest dam in the
world, which, if it should give way,
would utterly destroy millions of dol
lars invested by the Government and
private land holders, devastate an en
tiro valley, and. perhaps pale into in
significance .. the j Johnstown flood â
there are two" reputations at stake:
first, those of the "distinguished and
able engineers of your department,"
and second, "the reputation of the
American Portland cement industry
and those who have bullded it to its
present magnitude."
It is proposed that cement should bo
manufactured from materials found at
the Elte of the dam, and the memoran
dum points out that the reports upon
which the manufacture of Portland
cement are based, so far as machinery,
results and production are concerned,
are made by one who, according to the
records established by him in the
operation of cement works at Monte
zuma. New York and Colton, Cal., has
not been successful in his enterprise.-.
It. is obvious that E. A. Duryee, for
merly superintendent of the cement
works at Colton, Cal., is referred t:>,
and it is said that the works which he
built at Colton are being entirely re
constructed. He Is now in the employ
of the Government.
PANAMA, Dec. 25.â W. I. Buchanan.
United States Minister to the republic
of Panama, presented his credentials
to the provisional government to-day.
His reception was most enthusiastic
and was carried out in accordance with
the programme outlined in the Asso
ciated Press dispatches of yesterday,
being met at the, palace by a guard of
honor and by all the dignitaries of the
new republic now in Panama. In-pre
senting his credentials Minister Buch
anan said:
Â¦ "I am deeply sensible of the honor
conferred upon me by President Roose
velt and profoundly grateful for the
opportunity I am afforded- of meeting
your excellencies and the people of
Panama and of studying the conditions
existing in and the possibilities of the
republic of Panama.
"The advent and future development
of this new nation is the subject . of
keen and kindly interest on the part
of the people of the United States, all
of whom wish your excellencies, your
pcopic and your country that wide
progress and advancement which peace
and economy bring to all nations. , -
'"I am charged by President Roosevelt
to express his fervent wish that these
benefits shall come to the republic of
Panama, and that happiness and co'n-f^
tentment shall abide with your excel
lencies and your people."
Senor Jose Arango, president of the
junta, replied to Minister Buchanans â¢ j
address. He said that the provisldnal
government had received with great
satisfaction President Roosevelt's let
ter accrediting Mr. Buchanan as a
special envoy to the republic of Pan
ama, which was "proot of the spirit of
justice which animates the great peo
ple of the north, for whom the people
of Panama have the best wishe3Â»"
Senor Arango said that the junta
considered the selection for Minister of
a man of Mr. Buchanan's attainments
to be a good omen, and he believed the
new Minister would succeed in binding
still closer the ties of friendship which
now united the two republics.
GETTING TRANSPORTS READY"
Government lias Ordered Crook to Bo
Placed in Commission for Service.
A great deal of speculation is goincr
on in army transport circles regarding
what, if any, action the Government
intends taking in regard- to sending
troops to Panama. In the meantime,
however, according to reliable informa
tion, the only orders that have l'c-u fk
received from Washington are to the
effect that the Crook shall be immedi
ately placed in condition for service.
The Crook has been lying up in South
San Francisco Bay for nearly a year,
and naturally it will not only take some
time to put her in repair, but will take
a neat sum to have her again ready to
go into commission. She is a fine troop
and has a large carrying; capacity
and was always popular when she was
in active service. No specific orders
have been received, as far as can bo
learned, regarding the other transports
now in the harbor.
Major Duval positively declined to
make any statement upon the subject,
but is prepared tÂ»> carry out any in-
Instructions he may receive from tS4
War Department with dispatch.
If it is decided to â¢ send troops' to"
Panama from this port there will be no
occasion for delay on account of lack
of transport facilities.
The transport Crook will dock at
Steuart street wharf to--day. where she
will be made ready for service. The.
Buford will go on the drydock at Hun
ters Point this morning.

Special Dispatch to The Call
CONNELLSVILLE, Pa., Dec. 25.â
Another name has been added to the
long death Hat resulting from the
wreck on the Baltimore and Ohio Rail
read at Dawson on Wednesday. Harry
Devlin, one of the three remaining pa
tients at the Cottage State Hospital,
died at 10 o'clock this morning. The
total dead now numbers sixty-five, and
this probably completes the list, as
the two still at the hospital are doing
well and will probably recover. Dev
lin's home was at'Lenp.conlng. Md. ' â¢
There was er.e funeral to-day, that
of Edison Goldsmith. Goldsmith was
a popular young man and an immense
concourse attended the services. The
bodies of the other Connellsville vic
tims will be held until Saturday or
Sunday before burial. In fact, this is
a necessity, as the undertakers are too
overworked to attempt to- conduct sev
eral funerals in a. day.
Special services for the dead were
held in all the Protestant churches of
the coke regions to-day, and after the
burial of Father Fienello, which will
take place to-morrow, the Catholic
churches will hold masses for the dead.
The body of Father Fienellcr was con
veyed to the main body of the Church
of the Immaculate Conception to-day,
where it will remain In state until the
funeral services on Saturday. The bod
ies of about thirty of the. victims were
taken away on early trains. The re
maining identified victims will be ship
ped within the next' twenty-four hours
and those unknown will be cared fur
by the Borough Council.
President George G. Porter has called
a special meeting to take measures to
ward the formation of a relief commit
tee to look after bodies unidentified or
unclaimed. In case no friends appear
the citizens- will see that the victims
do- not find a last resting place in the
potter's field. The railroad company
will contribute liberally to this fund.
The official investigation into the
cause of the disaster is being prose
cuted vigorously^ by the officers of the
rcMroad company. It was apparent
that a number of switch ties which
had fallen off a west-bound freight
train and were strewn upc-n the pas

to be derailed.

SPOKANE, Dec. 25. â Andras Trand
nuii ate Christmas dinner at the
Salvation Army haven to-day and a
short time later his dead body was
found in the Spokane River at the foot
of Stevens street. The body was ly
ing between a couple of logs and was
found by some boys playing near the
scene.
No one saw Trandnun meet his
death, but it is believed he stumbled
and fell into the stream. There were
no marks of violence on the body.
When he ate dinner he was visibly
under the influence of liquor, but it
was thought the hearty meal would
straighten him out.
Trandnun was 52 year3 of age and
was a Norwegian. He came here two
weeks ago from Kalispell. The spot
where the body was found is one
where people are passing all the time
and how Trandnun fell to his death
without being noticed puzzles the au
thorities.

Imminent Commander Campbell was

Good cheer, loving sentiment and
charming music prevailed yesterday
morning in Golden Gate Hall on Sut

of San Francisco and invited brethren
from Oakland and Vallejo held their
regular Christmas observance.
It is a time-honored custom of the
great fraternity th? world over to as
semble iik their respective asylums each
Christmas day and at the same mo

by dependence upon the universal cal

Beyond the offering of a brief prayer
of gratitude to the Giver of All Things
for the ample fare provided, the Army
did not attempt to hold any religious
services during the dinner, and the
tunes played by the band were mostly
secular. But the red-shirted men and
poke-bonneted women moved quietly
air.cng the guests and with smiling
faces and encouraging woids made
them feel that they were welcome.
Perhaps that was the most effective
way of administering spiritual counsel
at that particular time. At any rate,
moist eyes were noted among the re
cipients of the kindly attention.
Colonel Franch, the local commander,
was present, but the management of
the dinner was in direct control of
M3jor Finn. All the Salvation corps
in the city were there, and every red
shirted man and poke-bonneted woman
helped in some way to facilitate the
feeding of the mass.
"Take your time and don't be
ashamed to ask for more," was the
order of the waiters to the gupsts, and
neither hurry nor bashfulness was ap
parent among the latter. For about
three hours every seat at table had
an occupant while a crowd of hungry
ones awaited their turn. No sooner
was a chair vacated than it was re
filled until at last the waiting throng
disappeared and the cooks and waiters
began to have time to rest a little. At
4 o'clock the multitude had be*>n fed.
"It has been a most succ;>Fsful din
ner," said Major Finn. "We have dis
posed of 1000 pounds of turkey, 1230
pounds of beef, a large pig and several
legs of mutton and I have not yet had
time to estimate the quantities of veg
etables and dessert stuffs that have
been consumed. No, all the food was
not donated, although the responses to
our appeal have been generous."
The menu consisted of roast turkey,
beef, mutton and pork, several kinds of
cooked vegetables, celery, pie, fruit,
nuts, candies, raisins and tea and cof
fee. Half a dozen deft cooks were kept
busy in the big kitchen adioining the
dining hall, and eight waiters, equally
divided as to. sex, served the food and
removed the dishes. It was a cheer
fully pathetic scene. Mingling with the
clatter of knives and forks and spoons
and crockery were strains from a band
of about a dozen pieces played by Army
musicians. The walls and ceilings were
decorated with greens, and each table
was embellished with several huge
bunches of chrysanthemums and red
berries.
Fifteen hundred free dinners were
served by the Salvation Army yester
day afternoon in the basemem of Odd
Fellows' Hall, at Seventh and Market
streets. Five tables, each with a seat
ing capacity of seventy-two persons,
were kept in full commission from
noon till 4 o'clock, and in addition to
the viands thus disposed of two hun
dred baskets, each containing five
meals, were sent out to worthy fam
ilies.
Another arrival was Dr. W. J. Arnold
of Cambridge University, who has come
over- to deliver a lecture on tuberculosis
before the medical faculty of Henry
Phipps College on January 29, at Phil
adelphia.
Among the passengers was Joshua
Levering of Baltimore, who was the
Prohibition candidate for President
with McKinley and Bryan, and who is
returning here from a tour of the world
accompanied by his wife and^flaughter.
When the ship righted it was seen
that her rudder post had been snapped
off, leaving the steering gear disabled
and the ship helpless. One sailor was
caught in the backwash of the wave
and dashed against the bulwarks, re
ceiving injuries from which he died
an hour later.
Three other seamen were seriously
injured by waves which broke over the
ship while they were trying to make
repairs to the shattered steering gear
and it became necessary- to lock the
passengers in the cabin. Oil was used
to still the waves, but with little effect.
For five days the ship rolled in the
trough of the sea. Captain Lucas and
his officers remaining on the bridge
night and day without sleep. Finally
at noon on the fifth day a temporary
steering gear was rigged and the ship
limped back to Falmouth, where the
passengers were sent back to Liverpool
and such of them as chose were sent to
New York on the Cedric.
NEW YORK, Dec. 25.âA number of
passengers who were on the Atlantic
transport steamer Menominee, bound
for this port when she was
struck by a hurricane December 7
and disabled so that she drifted at the
'mercy of the storm for five days, ar
rived here on the Cedric. They told
a thrilling story of their experience.
The Menominee left London Decem
ber 3. Four days later she ran into a
terrific gale, and a huge wave, which
the ship's officers said was sixty feet
high, struck the ship, throwing her on
her beam ends. It came with such force
as to crush in the heavy head lights in
the cabin ports on the starboard side
and the staterooms were flooded. Most
of the passengers were in bed when the
wave hit the ship. They were thrown
from their berths to the floor with bed
ding and baggage and everything mov
able on top of them.
The utmost confusion prevailed for
a time among the passengers, accord
ing to the story told to-day, and the
officers had difficulty in' quieting them.
The British Embassador and Lady
Durand and their daughter celebrated

PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 23.â Captain
Nichols of the British bark Andorinha,
which arrived here to-day from San
Francisco to load wheat for the United
Kingdom, reports that during a terrific
storm off the Columbia River he was
obliged to drop his anchors and rode
the gale out in this manner for three
days. Captain Nichols says that for
24 hours during the height of the storm
the vessel N was on her beam ends and
he almost despaired of saving his ship.
A tug managed to get a line aboard the
storm-tossed ship on the third day and
she was towed inside the mouth of the
river. THe Andorinha Is the largest
bark rigged craft sailing under the
British flag. .
VANCOUVER, B. C, Dec. 25.-Wlth
four deep wounds in the breast and
shoulders, the body of M. Katzalan, a
Japanese, was found lying at noon to
daj^jpin the Canadian Pacific Railway
yard, within a block of Chinatown. The
body was discovered under a freight
car, where it had evidently been
thrown. Katzalan was killed by blows
from a knife. Whether he was killed
in the railway yard or whether hi3
body had been carried to where it was
found is a matter of conjecture. The
generally accepted theory is that ha
was stunned by a blow on the head
and then stabbed to death.
Robbery apparently was not the mo
tive for the killing, for a small sum of
money was found in Katzalan's pock
ets and in his hand he clutched a 50
cent piece. One theory is that he was
killed in a Japanese gambling-house
in the vicinity and that his body was
dragged to where it was found.
Katzalan was a ticket-of-leave man.

Carl "Weiss, a Mojave mining man,
who was here recovering from an in

piazza of the Santa Rosa Hotel and
had his leg broken. Landslides were
caused in various parts of town, and
the Hollywood electric railway traffic
was blocked for several hours.
The oscillations were from northeast
to southwest, as if the foci from which
the waves advanced were in the moun
tains beyond Mount Lowe. There ap
peared to be a distinct upheaval of the
earth. Persons in several buildings In
the center of the city said that it felt
as if there had been an explosion under
the buildings. The shock lasted prob
ably three seconds and ivas felt gener
ally throughout the county and at
many places in Southern California.
Tourists from the East who had nev
er felt an earthquake were much fright
ened. In the hotels the guests became
excited and ran from their rooms into
the streets. .
There is general remark over the co
incidence that on Christmas day four
years ago Southern California had a
severe quake. As a result of that tem
blor six persons were killed and about
$100,000 worth of property was de
stroyed, many buildings in the town of
San Jacinto and a portion of Hemet
being laid in ruins.

destructive. No damage or consequence
resulted, a few buildings being slightly
wrenched and bricks thrown from oth

a rehearsal was, in progress, stones fell,
and the actors fled in terror from the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY. DECEMBER 26,/ 1903.
Then there was some excellent music
from the united choirs of Golden Gat3
and California commanderies, assem
bled on the stage. Adam's "Xoel" was
sung by Sir Knight C. L. Goettlng, with
full chorus. A toast to the memory of
the Knights who had passed away since
the previous Christmas, solemnly pro-
I posed by R. E. Sir F. AV. Sumner, was
drunk In silence and with uncovered
heads. Sir Knight L. A. Larsen and
tne choir sang Gounod's "Nazareth"
with telling effect. The toast "Cali
fornia Commandery No. 1, K. T,"
brought happy response from Eminent
Commander Thomas H. Browne of that
commandery, and when he had finished
speaking Sir Knight C. L. Gage and
the choir sang Adam's "The Anthem
Celestial." "Our Country" was the text
of a most brilliant patriotic address
from Sir Knight Samuel M. Shortridge,
and the peroration brought a thunder
of applause that fairly shook the walls.
"Hark! What Mean Those Holy
Voices?" (Hawley) was sung by i-ir
Knight D. M. IÂ»awrence and the full
chorus, and "Under Christ's Banner"
was responded to by Past Commander
H- D. Loveland. â¢
Impromptu addresses were delivered
by Tirey L. Ford, Colonel Woodruff and
D. C. Keith of Brockton, Mass., the Jat
ter responding to a toast to the famous
Bay State Commandery. After the sing
ing of Rhelnegger's "Who Art Tho:i?"
a benediction by Prelate W. H. Jordan
closed the proceedings.

Dr. Jerome A. Andersen, a well
known physician and prominent in
Theosophical. circles, died at his home
in this city yesterday. He was highly
esteemed by a large circle of acquain
tances. He leaves a widow and three
daughters, Ivy, Jessamine and Violet.
Dr. Anderson was brought into great
prominence through his connection with
the Society of Theosophlsts of. which
Madame Katherine Alice Tingley; the
master of the Universal Brotherhood,
played a prominent part at Point Loma
about a year ago. ; â¢â¢....
Dr. Anderson was at one time pres
ident of the local branch, but he re
signed about a. year arid a half ago,
which caused a great deal of com
ment in that society. The doctor's
resignation at that Hime was said to
be due to the alleged autocratic dis
position shown by Madame Tingley
in the management of the affairs of
her branch of the cult.
When the doctor resigned his posi
tion he made a very emphatic state
ment in regard to Mrs. Tingley. He
said her operations dissrusted him and
that she had conducted herself in a
manner deserving of the most severe
criticism as being at variance with the
conduct one would naturally expect
from the leader of the Theosophists of
the ' United States. He referred to
Madame Tingley as a woman full of
Ideas and they were as visionary as
those of Colonel Mulberry Sellers.
. He stated that she had a decidedly
combative temperament arid the result
was that she had involved the brother
hood in useless litigation. He added
that her acts had disgusted the Theos
ophists to such an extent that numer
ous withdrawals have resulted ; in fact,

camated with the , brotherhood a few

I. B. Small, who arrived in this city
from Oswego, Ore., a few days ago in
search of his runaway wife and her
paramour, was arrested last night by
Patrolmen Crowley and Cullinan on
Market street and booked on charges
of exhibiting a deadly weapon in a
rude and threatening manner and car
rying a concealed weapon.
According to the story told by Small
he visited Johnson's restaurant in an
endeavor to secure employment for one
of his children. Upon coming out of
the establishment he was assailed with
jeers and hoots by the crowd of union
pickets in front of the place. He paid
no attention to them, however, until
two young men approached and struck
him in the face. * Then, according to
Small, the crowd closed in on him and
in order, to protect himself he drew a
revolver, and held them at bay until
the arrival of the officers.
Small was booked at the Southern
station and when searched a pair of
brass knuckles were found on him
which was responsible for the ad
ditional charge.

PORTLAND. Or., Dec. 23.â John
Dobson. a well known banker of Che
halis. Wash., has received word from., t
W. E. Harmon, also of Chehalis, and
W. S. Crouch of Tacoma, who are in
New York, that they have sold the
Crouch buoy patent rights to New York
capitalists for $300,000. Dobscm and
Crouch owned the patents, Crouch be
ing the inventor.
Dobson and Crouch went to Wash
ington last winter. The Navy Depart
ment, satisfied that Crouch's invention
was worth a trial, gave them Ietter3
to the officers of the United States rev
enue cutter Gresham, stationed at New
York. They spent about three weeks
upon the Gresham. Daily tests of tha
invention were made In a,ll kinds of
weather and upward of twenty-five of
these tests showed that the buoy would
do all that was claimed for it.
The Lisle gun, with which ships are
equipped the world over, has its de
fects. There is a limit to its capacity
for sending a line ashore in time of
heavy sea when the wind is blowins
off shore. Crouch's buoy, it seem?,
overcomes all obstacles within a reas
onable distance, and it is claimed tag
it that it is far superior to the Lisle
gun. The mechanism i3 like a watch
and its workings are so perfect that
the beating- of ocean waves will auto
matically cause the buoy to drift ashore
and carry a line with it.

this morning these enthusiasts began
a pilgrimage that included almost all
Berkeley. With a tally-ho for con
veyance they started out and sang
sweet songs in front of the prominent
residences of the town. In .most in
stances the inmates were surprised and
wakened by the voices of the singers.
After traveling for several hours over
town the songsters returned to the
Presbyterian Church, where they were
served a hot breakfast by other mem
bers of the church. The serenading
party were Miss Minnie McAvoy, Miss
Marian Wendt, W. C. Smith, L. I.
Reed, Miss Marion Ainsworth, Miss
Nora Beatty and Ernest Page.
-A special committee was appointed
by the lodge, with Clay Hawbaker at
the head. Mr. Hawbaker organized his
forces and . requested every member of
the lodge to furnish him with a list
of the deserving poor that had come
under his notice. The Associated Char
ities and all charitable organizations
were appealed to, and a large number
of names and addresses were sent in.
It became necessary to segregate these
names, for many were duplicated.
When this was done it was found that
there were nearly 400 names. ; Most of
these wore investigated and less than
a dozen were found unworthy.
Then the work of ordering began,
for the Elks did not solicit donations,
except from members of the order, and
then only in the shape of money and
work. There was plenty of each. The
committee worked all last night and
into this morning, and when they had
finished each one of the 391 families
had been given a roast of beef that
was big enough for all, with some for
to-morrow. In addition to the meat
there were distributed 800 loaves of
bread, 720 cans of soup, 20 sacks of po
tatoes, 10 sacks of beans, 3.1 dozen pack
ages of mush, 30 boxes of apples, be
sides quantities of other vegetables,
coffee, tea. sugar, salt and pepper, and
"verything that went to make a din
ner complete. Headquarters were made
in the house at 1252 Franklin street, the
use of which was donated by Montel
Taylor, and hor3es and buggies, wag
ons, carts and all kinds of vehicles
were pressed into service for delivery.
William Fieldwick of the Oakland race
track sent two men and four vehicles
to aid in the delivery.
The general arrangements were in
the hands of Clay Hawbaker with a

Oreo was, arrested within an hour
after the shooting had been reported
to the police. Captain Peterson per
sonally handled the case. With Detec
tive Kyte and Patrolman Ely. Petersen
located Oreo, took him to Fabiola Hos
pital, where Gratiano identified the
prisoner, and then sent the man to the
City Jail. Detective Kyte procured a
dyine statement in legal form from
Gratiano. the statements of all the es
sential witnesses were in writing and
the cas* was readv for court before
three hours had elapsed after the first
report had been received at police head
quarters. When daylight came there
was nothing left for the police to do
but to watch developments in Gra
tiano's condition.
Until the condition of the wounded
man shal! warrant action, Oreo will
not be formally charged with the shoot
ing, unless an effort should be made
by his friends to procure his release
from custody by means of a writ of
habeas corpus. In such event, if Gra
tiano fhall live, a charge of assault
vith intent to murder will be regis
tered acainst Oreo. The charge will
be changed to murder should Gratiano
die.
Louis Gratiano, who was shot from
ambush on Broadway, near Forty*flrst
street. Wednesday night, has a po^jible
chance to recover despite the fact that
pneumonia has develoDed as a result
of a bullet wound in his right lung.
The wound in the patient's throat is
giving no serious trouble, according to
Dr. George EL Derrick.
Neither Gratiano nor his son, who
was with his father when the shooting
occurred, has retracted in a single
detail the statement they made to Cap
tain of Police W. J. Petersen that Louis
Oreo flred the shots. Gratiano's posi
tive identification, corroborated by his
son's, leaves no doubt in the minds of
the police that Oreo is the man. The
prisoner declares that he is guiltless.

OAKLAND, Dec. 25. â Oakland's
Christmas was delightful in every way-
The weather was superb,, the sim shin
ing as in midsummer. Throughout the
residence and business sections of the
city were many holiday decorations,
and the church bells rang merrily.
In all the churches there were special

Willie Kuhl, the cashboy who was
seriously injured last night while play
ing in the basement of Taft & Pen
noyer's store at Fourteenth street and
Broadway, where he was employed, un
derwent an operation this morning at
East Bay Sanitarium.
Dr. J. JI. Shannon, who performed
the operation, found an extensive frac
ture on the left side of the boy's skull
just above the par. The skull was i
trephined, three pieces of bone being
removed, and the boy soon rallied. Dr.
Shannon thinks that if the patient is
strong enough to bear the shock re
sulting from the operation he will re
cover, but it is possible that Kuhl's
extreme youth may tell against him
and the injury result fatally.
Joe Balagno-, the cashboy with whom
Kuhl was scuffling when he was hurt,
was so nervous and unstrung when he
learned how badly his playmate was
injured that he threatened to commit
suicide, and it was necessary for his
parents to keep him under restraint
until they learned this mornins that
Kuhl was still alive and might recover.
The two boys were engaged in a good
natured tussle, v.hen Balagno tripped
Kuhl, v.ho fell, striking his head on
the hard cement floor of the basement.

was filled an hour before the service
began. The decorations surpassed even
those for which the church has been
notable in years past. A huge screen
with three Gothic entrances made en
tirely of holly with its red berries was
placed at the steps of the altar rail.
On the west of the beautiful screen and
hanging from the wall was a cross
composed of berries and holly, while
suspended on the southern wall was a
cross of pure white roses.
The sermon at the 11 o'clock service,
by the rector, the Rev. Burr M. Weed
en, was delivered with a force that ap
pealed to the immense assemblage.
The Rev. Mr. Weeden told of the day,
of its being the holiest and the purest
and the brightest day of all the year.
He told that it was of God's appoint
ment and not of man's choice and that
it was his imperial will that brought
round such intervals for worship and
thanksgiving.'
Christmas day, he said, was not like
other days, for on that day of rejoicing
there was an added sweetness that was
appreciated by every man, whether he
was a believer or non-believer, for even
the unbeliever experienced an invisible
charm in the day.
The very fields, said the Rev. Mr.
Weeden, possessed a mysterious light;
heaven whispered to them and the spell
was felt even upon the streets. It was,
he said, the spell'of God. There came
to them that day. said the rector, a
holy vision, almost sad because it was
to beautiful.

THE Sacramento Valley Development Association,
which is directly concerned in the beneficial work
of promoting the prosperity of the valley coun
ties, has hit upon a plan to systematize for ready ref
erence all available facts, concerning its section. "Strike

value is commonly recognized in its application to af
fairs of business. The primary aim of the Sacramento

stantly ready for all homescekers who may inquire. The
advantage inhering in such readiness is evident. It , is
striking "when the iron is hot." V . , ?']"..
The Sacramento Union publishes the details of the
association's plan, and says: / . .?
'/The association is taking steps to compile and have
for reference complete .information 'regarding the

After years of delay. protest, exasperation and
threats, Mexico has listened to the appeals of Washing
ton and promises, upon the bond of Mexican assurance,
that she will grant speedy trials to Americans arrested
and, accused within her borders. This information is
encouraging. It may lead at least to the admission that
an American in Mexico, even by sufferance, is on earth.
Lamentable as the wholesale slaugh
ter of big game may be. the killing of
human beings incidental to the sport
should produce a haft on the part of
voracious hunters. In Ontario the
"bag" for the season was 4235 deer, 1300
moose and twenty-seven human beings,
and the license record shows that Penn
sylvania and New York furnished the
largest number of hunters. During the
short season of twenty days in Minne
sota as many as 20,000 deer, including
moose and caribou, were brought into
St. Paul from Minnesota and Northern
Wisconsin, and the loss of life was
twenty killed. Including two women,
besides seven dangerously wounded
and many others injured. The growing
unpopularity of the small caliber rifle
on the part of the hunters is due to the
fact that unless a vital spot is pierced
the game escapes; the guides and the
woodmen who have to run the risks of
taking the fusillade despise the weapon.

King Edward is taking a very active
part in securing the revival of the to
bacco industry In Ireland. Away back
in the reign of King Charles II. the
growing of tobacco in England and Ire
land was strictly forbidden by law, un
der penalty, of fine and imprisonment,
with the object of developing the pros
perity of the royal colony of Virginia,
the staple industry of which was the
cultivation and export of tobacco. In
England the prohibition has always
been maintained, although Virginia has
long ceased to belong to England. But
about SO years ago tobacco-growir.s
was permitted in Ireland, and for about
two decades the cultivation was most
successfully carried on, as much as J3^>
an acre of net profit being realized,
while $300 per acre was the averjjfs
clear profit. Moreover, in 1830. when
the distress was so great in Ireland,
the only county that did not suffer
was Wexford, where the cultivation
tobacco was an established industry.
But about the time that Queen Victoria
came to the throne the English Govern
ment stepped in and forbade any fur
ther growth of the plant, giving as a,
pretext for this" arbitrary measure fiscal
reasons and the difficulty of collecting
the revenue on the tobacco, thus crush
ing a prosperous industry and depriv
ing a country whose poverty has been
almost proverbial of the means of de
veloping a good source of Income.
Thanks largely to the Influence and tÂ»
the initiative of King Edward jail re
strictions are now about to be removed
and tobacco may become once more a
flourishing industry in the Emerald
Isle.
Reviving an Industry.
Wyoming is in a condition to make known the
progress of this destruction more accurately than any
other State or Territory in the arid belt. When her
cattle-grazing on the public range practically ceased it
was ascertained that her loss in cattle values could be
made good only, by substituting thirteen million sheep,
and if was then admitted that so many sheep would re
duce the State to a dust heap. As a matter of fact six
million sheep replaced" the lost cattle, and these have so
far perfected their work on the public range that the
number is being reduced at the rate of a million a year.
This is the fact that startled the association, which is
charged with promotion pf the interests of the State.
It was admitted that if the range were under control the
forage could'bc renewed .and increased and cattle
growing could become a' leading industrj r , while such
control would also be for, the benefit of sheep-owners,
who would not Overstock, and would get better value
out of their stocks' by their having better feed.
In discussing this subject Senator Warren said that
for years the representatives of the arid West disagreed
over plans for irrigation. Some wanted all public lands
ceded to the respective States, that the States might
take up irrigation in some form; others insisted upon
deriving the millions needed for irrigation from the Fed
eral Treasury by direct appropriation, like the river and
harbo'r bill. So, some having one plan and some another,
the whole matter lagged. AtMast, and unexpectedly, the
West got together, pushed aside the grafters and doc
trinaires and the men who dream dreains, and passed
the present irrigation law, deriving the fund for that pur
pose from the sale of the public lands and devoting it to
its purpose under Federal oversight.
The Senator said that a like concert and agreement
would probably be reached in a measure to protect that
vast proportion of the public domain which is â¢ fit for
grazing, and for grazing only. This plan when reached
should leave the title to. the land in the Federal Gov
ernment. It should exact such a rental on the four hun
dred million acres of range land as will make a large
annual . contribution to the irrigation funjd, to which it
should be devoted. It should leave the entire range area
open to the homesteader and mineral prospector who
comes bona fide, and it should be in all respects safe
guarded against monopoly and speculation.
It is to be hoped that the Senator is right in his con
clusion that ' such an adjustment may be reached. At
present we are exiling our land-seekers and livestock
men.' They arc going to Canada and- Mexico and tak
ing our livestock industry with them. We are acting no
more intelligently than did Louis XIV when he ex
pelled the Huguenots from .France and 1 banished with
them the arts and crafts of the cpuntry and brought on
that destruction of industry which caused the French
Revolution.
'.'As Senator Warren has been for years a leading
advocate of the cession of the public domain, range and
all, to the States, it will be seen that, impressed by the
decay of sheep-running in. his State, he abandons a dog
matic, attitude and invites the West to get together.
That Us the first rift in the cloud, and it is to be hoped
that his extension of the olive branch will cause the
West to get together. The path seems to be pointed out
In "the President's proposition for a commission to'ex
amine, the whole land question and report by bill.
AT the recent meeting of the Wyoming State In
dustrial and Producers' Association, the statistics
of the livestock interests of that State were pre
sented. Wyoming was formerly a leading cattle State,
but overstocking the range fed out and destroyed the
forage for cattle, and they were replaced by sheep.
Sheep are more destructive to the range than cattle, for
they av closer feeders and soon take up the seed and
the roots of all forage plants.
Every dry country ranged by sheep has been de
prived of its forage and reduced to desert conditions. In
moist Scotland and England the long wool sheep graze
without destructive effects, but in arid Spain the grease
wool Merinoes have destroyed the country, as they have
in Eastern Europe and Western Asia. The sands cover
Pcrsepblis and the cities of the plain that were once
proud political and commercial /capitals and the seats of
empire because sheep and goats destroyed vegetation and
brought in the desert. It is apparent that unless there
is some regulation of grazing it will soon be seen that
nature plays no favorites on this continent, but that like
causes will produce like effects here. â¢ '

The disagreeable fact has to be faced,

of fishermen of several nations, that
the shark has once more to be reckoned
with in European waters. In the Bal

1759, they have made their reappearance
in/considerable numbers, and several
fishing boats report having had whole
draughts of fish devoured from the
nets, which were broken in the Belt and
the Cattegat. A fisherman who fell
overboard narrowly escaped with his
life. Shoals of sharks, some of them
of large size, have been seen off the
German coast, and they are even re
ported as becoming far from rare in
the North Sea. Their presence is at

The Burden of Glaciers. .
IiV G. FREDERICK WRIGHT. A. M.. LL. D.
[Author of â¢The'lc* Age In North America."
â¢Man and the Glacial Period." Etc.]
â¢ Copyright, 1003. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
In its movement over the uneven sur
face of the land the ice which flowed
southward over so .great a part of
North America in the glacial period
ground off the prominences and dragged
the grist along slowly under it, spread
ing it out-over the country invaded and
tending to fill up the valleys and pro-'
duce a general level. It is this action
of the glacier that has largely pro
duced the level plains of the prairies of
the Mississippi Valley; so -to speak, the
giwier has "ironed" out the ruffles in
the continent and left it comparatively
smooth. The whole glaciated area is
covered with ancient river channels
and gorges, which have b'een complete
ly filled up with the grist of the glacier,
whilo to a great depth it is spread out
over the central and southern portions
to furnish the arable soils from which
the richness of the country is derived.
The depth of these glacial deposits
south of th<? great lakes probably aver- j
ages more than 100 feet, and in some
places where a buried river gorge is
penetrated it is known to have been
more than D00 feet in depth. Over j
Northern Germany and Northwestern j
Russia the depth of the glacial deposits !
is estimated to average 125 feet.
These glacial deposits can be easily
recognized and distinguished from
those made by water by their unassort
ed character, by the angularity of the |
imbedded fragments of stone and the
frequent occurrence of scratches upon
them. Deposits made in running water
are uniformly assorted and .stratified,
but in the direct glacial "deposits the
pebbles and rock fragments are indis
criminately mixed in the whole mass
like plums in a pudding.
â¢ 'â¢ Â«
A few facts concerning the glacial
period give . new force to the adage,
"Truth is stranger than fiction." The
6.000,000 square miles covered by the
glacial ice in North America and Eu
rope to the depth of one mile (probably
an underestimate) would furnish 6,000,
000 cubic miles of ice, all of which is
formed by water abstracted from the
ocean. This would reduce the level of
the ocean the world over 250 feet and
add to the northern part of the conti
nents twÂ« or three times the weight of
the entire land surfaces of North Amer
ica and Europe which are above sea
level. This additional weight would be
such a powerful attracting force that
it would lower the general level of the
ocean fifty feet more. * .
The weight of this ice over every
square mile would be 4,000,000,000 tons,
which would have to be multiplied by
6,000,000 to get the total amount. This
is probably enough to cause the crust
of the earth to sink under it when the
ice accumulated, and to allow it to
rise again when it. had .'melted off.
This perhaps of itself accounts for the
great changes of level in the northern
hemisphere which have taken place
since the beginning of the glacial
period.
Â¦ - ' * * . â¢
The spring freshets or this glacial
period were of enormous dimensions,
causing, as I have recently isoertained,
the Missouri River to rise annually 200
feet instead of forty, as it sometimes
does now.
The'.close of the glacial period was
so recent that it comes down beyond
the advent of man. Glacial man fol
lowed, up. the retreating ice border in
New Jersey, Ohio, Kansas and Minne
sota as he is now doing in Greenland
and Alaska.
The glaciers of the world are now
nearly all retreating. The front of the
Muir glacier, which I visitor! in 1886,
and have described in my "Jc-j Age in
North America," is now three miles
farther back than.it was at that time,
and, according to all accounts, it is
thirty, miles farther back than it was
when Vancouver discovered U 100 years
ago.
We are not so far separated from tha
glacial period as it would seem to the
casual observer. Probably it would reV
quire but a slight increase of snowfall,
combined with a slight lowering of the"
temperature, to. cause glaciers again to
form on the White Mountains and In
Labrador, and the already exiting gla
ciers to begin a readvance. When once'
begun it would be difficult to tell when
the- advance would stop, for glaciars
of themselves tend to lower the tem
perature and to increase ' thÂ«! snowfall.
When we reflect upon the way the heat
oif the tropics is distributed by the

It was then that James J. Hill
brought forward his securities holding
scheme, with such elaboration as was
necessary to take in the capital shares
of both the Northern Pacific and the
Great Northern railroads. The capital
ization of the Northern Securities Com
pany was fixed at $400,000,000 for two
reasons, as explained by both Mr. Mor
gan and Mr. Hill. One reason was that
it was desirable to have the securities
holding company so large that no spec
ulative or aggressive interest could go
into the open market at any time i./i
buy control of it. The other reason
was that Mr. Morgan. Mr. Hill and
Mr. Harriman wanted the new com
pany to be in a position to take every
share of Northern Pacific and Great
Northern stock on terms uniform to
each Individual holder. Mr. Hill in
sisted that every small holder should
be enabled to convert his stock at the
same price the large holders received,
and as market quotations ruled when
the conversion was made the $400,000,000
of Northern Securities stock at par
mould just about .>ay for all of the
Â«tock of the two railroad companies.
J. Pierpont Morgan reorganized the
Northern Pacific about this time and
looked around for a purchaser. He was
determined to keep the property out
of the hands of speculators and sug
gested to John S. Kennedy, D. Willis
James and other New York friends of
Mr. Hill that the reorganized road af
forded a good field for investment.
Soon thereafter several larg 1 ? blocks of
Northern Pacific stock passed to the
control of Mr. Hill and his friends, and,
although Mr. Morgan practically re
tained the management, the dominant
influence was that of James J. Hill. It
was the latter who negotiated the joint
purchase of the Â£000 miles of Chicago.
Burlington and Quincy lines by the
Northern Pacific and the Gr^at North
ern, and it was Mr. Hill who baid "No"
peremptorily when E; H. Harriman
asked that the Union Pacific be ad
mitted to partnership in tlie Burling
ton purchase.
Mr. Hill's peremptory "No" precipi
tated the ftock-buying contest for con
trol of the Northern Pacific which
waged with panic fierceness for two
days early in May. l?02. Mr. Morgan
Â¦was in Europe just then, but his firm
joined with Mr. Hill in seeking to pre
vent Mr. Harriman and his associates
from getting a majority of Northern
Pacific shares. It was virtually ;t drawn
battle. Each party to the fight con
sented to a truce in order to avert a
wild panic in Wall street. The Harri
man party counted up about $75,000,000
of the J155.O00.000 of Xorthgrn -.Pacific
stock and the board of directors were
recast by Mr. Morgan â at th~ quest of
all parties interested â and the Union
Pacific received proportionate repre
sentation. What to do with thxse enor
mous accumulations of Northern Pa
cific stock was the question. Neither
party wanted to carry their heavy bur
dens permanently, and Mr. Hill and
Mr. Morgan realized the necessity of
fixing the control of the property in
such 3. way that it could not bt easily

Here is the story of the origin and
promotion of the Northern Security
Company. the $400,000,000 securities
holding corporation whose- right* of ex
istence has been so strenuously opposed
by the Government.
About wven years ago James J. Hill,
president of the Great Northern Kail
way, spoke to some of his business as
sociates of the desirability of a cor
poration in which could be concen
trated the control of the great svs-
Um of rail and water transportation
to the upbuilding of which he had
given the greater part of his business
career. Practically all of the large for
tune accumulated by Mr. Hill was in
vested in the Great Northern "system.
With a fÂ»w personal friends as part
ners he had secured absolute control of
the property. These friends were LorJ
Strathcona, Lord Mount Stephen, John
P. Kennedy, D. Willis James and one
or two others. All of these men were
considerably past middle age and they
felt that a,s they grew old together it
would be gratifying to have assurance
of the permanency of the property th;it
had beÂ«=-n developed and conserved by
their capital and efforts.
Said Mr. Hill to Lord Strathcona. who
was then rast 70 years of age: "That
my d^ath or your death or the demise
of our partners should <liprupt and con
fuse our wrll-laid plans for the future
at this property 5s something I can
only contemplate with sorrow. We
must make such provision as will *e.;p
this system intact and insure the com
pletion of our plans for its develop
ment." Up to that period of Mr. Hill's
idea of a securities holding company
embraced Great Northern interests
only. He had previously suggested,
however, that some steps be taken to
harmonize the policies of the Northern
Pacific and the' Great Northern, in
order that these two Northwestern rail
road systems be restrained from cut
ting: into each other's territory and in
juring each other's business. Overtures
fnr a !ease cf the Northern Pacific to
the Great Northern were made, but
such vigorous opposition was raised by
shippers and politicians throughout the
Northwest that the project was aban
doned.
two large globes on either side of this
opening from ,whieh the effervescence
seems to rise. However, a stone cast
in. after a few minutes, throws tho
whole fountain into a violent agitatifjt-t
Another of the openings, about four
inches in diameter, is through an ele
vated rock from which the water spout*
at intervals of 40 seconds. The watejf\>
in all its properties is equal to any
artificial fountain, and is constantly
foaming and sparkling. Those wha
visit this fountain drink large quanti
ties of the water, with good effect to
health.
THE Secretary of the Interior refuses to permit San
Francisco to seek the most accessible- point in the
mountains for a water supply, because it lies with
in Yosemite National Park. We treat 'he subject re
gardless of the issue of municipal ownership of the
water supply/ The Yosemite Park reservation was" made
originally by Congress as a forest reserve, and since
then there is no act of Congress changing the character
given to it by the original act. The matter becomes of
great importance to the whole State on account of the
attitude of the Interior Department toward private own
ers of patented lands in the reservation, and toward all
who desire to make use of its waters or other resources,
when such use is consistent with the, purpose of a forest
reservation, which is the preservation of the timber. ,
The law gives the public the same rights to water,
ditches and rights of way in a forest reservation that
exist on public lands not reserved, and the law also
gives to the Secretary of the. Interior the discretionary
power to grant the same rights in a national park. In
pursuance of this discretion he refuses to grant such
rights to private owners, and to this city, which desired
to secure a supply of potable water. Now the water
belongs to the Federal Government only in meandered
streams. The water in the Sierra Nevada Mountains
does not belong to the United States. It is the prop
erty of the State or of the people, subject to such tenure
and use as the State, law defines. *
The Yosemite reservation is a vast area. It saddles
the mountains. It covers the leading water sources of a
great part of the State. Effective use of the water with
in it, either for mining, irrigation, power or domestic
purpose*. "requires that diversion occur at an altitude
that places it within the line of the reservation. Such
is the situation of the only water supply for all pur
poses of a large part of the State. The Secretary of the
Interior, acting, as he no doubt believes, within his au
thority, refuses to permit use of the water. The gravity
of the matter goes far. beyond the water supply of this
city, for it involves the right of an administration officer
of the Federal Government to arbitrarily sequester the
most important natural resources of the State and forbid
their application to economic uses needed for the life
of the community.
The action of the Secretary ties '-up immense mining
interests in Mariposa and other counties, and is restric
tion of the gold output, of the State. As for this city,
the ca.se is just as grave as it would be if we had no other
source whence to derive a supply of potable water, and
the Secretary's action is just the same as if he arbi
trarily refused to San Francisco the only available sup
ply of water. ,
The ground upon which he refuses, to use his dis
cretionary power is that natural scenery may be marred.
If our contention that this is only a forest reserve be
true, the sceroc proposition is misplaced.. But if that
contention be incorrect, the question may well be asked
whether the preservation, of scenery is a compensation
for the denial of use of water to a large part of the
State. .. , .. ..
As a matter of fact nearly all of the-ftow of Hctch-
Hetchy Valley is in private ownership and was -long
years before the reservation was made. -The Owner has
certain common law rights by virtue of his ownership!
though their assertion and use require that he wage a
costly legal war with the Federal Government. It is
probable, too, that the State as controller" of these waters
has an equitable interest that is actionable. The mat
ter is so consequential to the interests of the State and
a large ipart of our people as to warrant correctionary
action by Congress.
No one doubts that the Secretary is acting in good
faith, but thatjdoes not benefit the irrigators and miners
and others whp need the use of water for all purposes to
which it may applied. The people most interested are
those who static! for progress in the policy of forest re
serves. That progress is impeded by inimical public
sentiment generated in the arbitrary denial of uses that
are consistenr-with forest preservation. This antagon
istic sentiment is nerved and friends of the forests are
unnerved by the decision of the* Secretary.
It was Monday morning In the Po
lice Court. The Judge gazed with dis
gust at the motley aggregation of va
grants, drunks and petty offenders
culled from Sunday's joyousness. One
by one the prisoners were disposed of,
the Judge showing little leniency in the
disposition of fines and imprisonments.
Toward noon the filthy mob had
thinned out until one frowsy looking
individual was left standing before
his Honor's high court ot justice.
"What's this man charged with?"
queried the Judge. "Vagrancy, your
Honor," replied the. custodian of the
peace.
Gazing intently at the dirt-begrimed
bum, who was attired mostly in a shirt
of uncertain hue. his Honor said: "How
long do you wear your shirts?"
"The ordinary length, "your honor;
about three inches above the knee,"
replied the bum. with alacrity.
"Six months!" thundered the magis
trate, who allowed no bum to pass it
up to him on a platter that way with
out retribution.

Many of the smaller holders of Great
Northern stock have not exchanged
their shares for' Northern Securities
stock, consequently there is consider
able of the latter stock unissued. It
is estimated that about $325,000,000 of
the total 5400,000,000 is now in the hands
of the Morgan, the Hill and the Har
rlman interests. President Hill believes
that the Northern Securities is legally
sound and expects that the Federal
court will so declare. That, however,
is doubted by others. The Government
attorneys are equally confident.
It was, stipulated that the Northern
Securities .Company, although owning
the stocks pf the Northern Pacific and
the Great Northern, sliould not inter
fere in any way with the operation
of those railway systems. In fact, the
charter -of the securities company pro
vides only for ownership of securities
and does not limit these to railroad
securities. . .

Shoe shops are receiving few new
orders and there is little effort at pres
ent to increase activity. Eastern
wholesalers are more cautious regard
ing additional contracts for spring
lines, but Western jobbers are seeking
supplies liberally.
Conservatism i3 still the leading
characteristic in every department of
the cotton goods market. Mills are
steadily curtailing output, and find it
impossible to secure advances in fin
ished product commensurate with the
rise in raw material. Purchasers of
cotton take only for urgent needs and
refuse to pay the quotations asked for
distant deliveries. No demand for
China is se^n.and the export division
is doing nothing, prices being well be
yond the views of foreign customers.
Cotton has again risen above all rec
ords for. a quarter of a century, and
fluctuations of $2 50 a bale in a single
session is no longer considered ex
ceptional, while option trading of a
million bales daily is not unusual. Few
cash sales are reported and the plant
ers are not receiving $68 for their cot
ton, yet the mills that have no raw ma
terial on hand will be forced to pay the
prices or else stop wprk. Exports have
continued on a liberal scale.
Grain moved within narrow lines, no
special news appearing other than a
new record for wheat production in
Australia. Frlces are firm.
Failures this week numbered 284 in
the United States, against 209 last year,
and 22 in Canada, compared with 21 a
year ago.
Expressions of opinions are heard in
many prominent lines that orders will
begin to appear about" the middle of
January, and a liberal volume of these
will be placed for work to be <'.one

Owing'to the decrease in speculation,
bank exchanges for the week were 16.7

New York,. while in other leading cities
there was a gain of leading interests
in the iron and steel Industry, which

by; deciding against any further reduc

purchasers do * not intend to delay

Diatomaceous earth, a product of
Southern California, heretofore little in
demand, has recently come into prom
inence as a building material where a
fire-proof deafening is desired. Santa
Barbara County has the largest, known
deposits of this peculiar substance in
the State. Attention was first called to
it by the late Prof. Ford fully twenty
five years ago. It is a yellowish-white
deposit, resembling what is commonly
called chalk rock. It has been shipped
from the northern end of the county in
small quantities for many years, for
manufacturing purposes, and more re
cently the Balaam Bros, of Lompoc
have done quite an extensive business
in supplying the increased demand
since it3 value as a building material
was discovered. There are several
large deposits in the range of moun
tains next to the coast, and as it comes
into more general use, as it promises
to do, it is possible it may become an
important item of export.
"In character the new material re
sembles ground asbestoa and is only
one-eighth as ' eavy ss sand or clay,
consequently it floats. The registered
name of sil-o-cel derives its oddity from
thfÂ» fact that the article contains sili
con oxygen and the infinite cells of the
diatom. The 'value & any sound

is the fact that it contains cells, or
chambers that serve to hold air in

only three or four places in the world
where diatomaceous earth may be
mined in quantity.
New oil lands in Southern California
are coming under the pump, but the

much of it was bought by the Standard

cents per barrel it was feared it would
have a tendency to hold the Driceof

operations on the 1400 and 1S0O levels.
A site for a mill has been surveyed at

NEW BUILDING MATERIAL.
According to the Grass Valley Union
forty-five men are pushing work on the
Tuba or ElOro mine, near
The mill is to be repaired and an aerial
tramway is to be constructed. The
same paper says about hydraullcking
at the Liberty Hill mine:
"Superintendent William A. Maguire
of the Liberty Hill mines has received
the cheering intelligence that the Cali
fornia Debris Commission has granted
permission to his company to construct
restraining dams in Bear River and In
Stump Canyon, which are outlets .to
the mines. Several years ago attempts
were made to get permits to operate
the mines, but for some reason the Cal
ifornia Debris Commission refused per
mission, although great influence was
exerted to that end. The news that the
commission has permitted the construc
tion of the dams is favorable. The
work of construction of the dams will
proceed as rapidly as possible under the
direction oi Mr. Maguire, who is an ex
perienced hydraulic miner. It is to be
hoped that the mines can once more
resume operations without injury to
the property of others, and with the
substantial barriers which it Is planned
to erect there is no reason why this
cannot be done."
MIXING IN THE NORTH.
Several large oil companies operating
in the Whlttier field have in view the
construction of a refinery to handle
their output. Pennsylvania men are
reported to be back of the scheme. In
connection with the refinery it is pur
posed to erect a large plant for the
manufacture of carbon, as tests have
proven that the highest grade of car
bon can be produced from the Whittier
oil, worth from $300 to $500 per ton in
the market. A pipe line to the coast is
also a part of the same general enter
prise credited to the Whittier oil pro
ducers.
The Tuolumne Independent reports
that the Eagle-Shawmut. Company is
having surveys on Curtis Creek, on the
old Soulsby and McAuley ranches, pre
liminary to commencing work on a
large storage reservoir. The reservoir
will be about four times the size of
Phoenix Lake and will 'be used by the
Shawmut Company to store water for
power, which will be kept in reserve
until the regular water' supply gives
out and will then be drawn on. A forty
foot dam will be built, which will flood
the water over the old Soulsby and
part of the McAuley ranches, on Curtis
Creek.
The Mining and Scientific Press gos
sips about the Government and the
miner, and hands down the following
comforting suggestion to the mining
man:
"There are those who consider the
cost of securing a patent^ to mining
land a great hardship as compared
with a patent to agricultural land. The
usual full-sized mining claim contains
about twenty acres of ground; the
usual agricultural entry contains 160
acres, or eight times as much as a min
ing claim. The difference in cost Is con
siderable, it is true, particularly when
a comparison is made of the relative
area of the two claims, but, as pre
viously stated, taking out a patent to a
mining claim is not peremptory, and
the owner of such a location would be
unwise to patent a claim, that would
not produce a profit. Ordinarily a sin
gle foot along the course of a good-pay
ing mineral vein will produce more
profit than several farms of 160 acres
each are capable of producing in a
number of years. This is not by any
means the rule, but it is often the
case."
The Placerville Nugget says concern
ing the operations of miners in El Do
rado County:
"The contract has been let for the
construction of a new ten-stamp mill at
the Gamecock mine, on. Webber Creek,
in Gold Hill mining district. A mill site
has already been graded. Pov.er will
be furnished by water from the Jurgens
ditch under 180 feet pressure. ' A new
shaft is being sunk on jthe Gamecock
that is now eighty-five feet deep. The
same company, that is developing the
Gamecock is also working the' Mam
moth mine, on the opposite side of
Webber Creek. The main tunnel on the
Mammoth was in 383 feet last Monday.
A twelve-foot ledge of milling ore has
been developed, 'Â¦ and the company is
making arrangements to install a five
stamp mill on the property.
"The shaft of the Havilah mine, at
Nashville, is now down 800 feet. The
company has purchased and will at
once Install on the mine a new sixty
horsepower engine and boiler and a
new eight-drill air compressor.
â¢ "George Shurtleff has secured a bond
on the Big Jim mine, a mile and a half
south of Latrobe, and will soon begin
the work of developing the property.
The Big Jim is a large low grade prop
osition. .
"Development work on the Noonday
copper mine, on Mathena.s Creek, is still
progressing actively. About thirty-five
tons of ore a day is being hauled. to El
Dorado, where it is shipped to the
works of ! the Peyton Chemical Com
pany, at Peyton, Contra Costa County.
"ThÂ« Peyton Company is supplying
the Standard Oil Company with large
quantities of sulphuric acid, which is
a by-product of the leaching process
and is used at the refinery at Point
Richmond.

The event this year did not fall
behind any of its predecessors in point
of eclat. More than one hundred cou
ples participated in the grand march
and the lookers-on were many. Naval
and military uniforms there were
aplenty, despite the fact that not a few
of the officers appeared in conventional
"ppike-tail" or more neplige tuxedo.
The women were gowned beautifully,
of course, and the display of diamonds
was unusually brilliant â even for a
Christmas hop at the Occidental.
In the way of decorations the hosts
were not skimpy of either expense or
taste. The dance was held-in the main
dining room on the second floor and at
the head of the bip stairways leading
thereto stood an immense tree, fairly
ablaze with incandescent globes of va
rious hues, v. hile evergreens were
wreathed and banked in profusion
around the massive columns. In the
ball room the general color scheme was
green, relieved artistically with cardi
nal. Festoons of fir hung between the
I'i'.lars ranged along the center of the
thamber and were draped along the
walls, while the big chandeliers were
swathed in Fmilax. In vivid relief were
broad cardinal streamers suspended
from the apex of each festoon. The
ball room was divided from the supper
chamber by a neat arrangement of
gnarled tree branches glistening with
artificial snow. The musicians were
hidden in a bower of green.
The general arrangements were in
control of L. D. Stone, and eulo
giums of his good taste were ireely be-
Etbvred by the guests. Among those
that participated in the affair were of-
Qcers from the war vessels New York,
independence and Pensacola and from
F<Tt Miley. Fort Baker, the Presidio
and Furt Alcatraz. The invitation list
iTv.luded:
Ir- accordance with a custom almost
as old as the femed house itself, the
ir.nnayemer.t of the Occidental Hotel
(-Â¦ive ix Christmas night hop m honor of
the naval and military men stationed in
a::d contiguous to San Fra'ncisco. So
attractive have been these annual
cv*Â»n*s in the past that those for whose
enjoyment they are planned look for
ward to them with fond anticipation,
and very few of the invitations fall to
biiotT affirmative response. Indeed, It
is aim;.- and navy tradition that offi
cers have postponed the date of their
departure from the city in order to at
tf-nd the Christmas ball at the Ooci
dental.

1 \ Greatest En the World esrjCONTEST IS FAST
AND INTERESTING,
SAYS COACH WARNER
CARLISLE played a
mighty fast game; In
fact,' the fastest game
seen on tills coast this season.
The Indians appeared to be
light, but they played hard
football. The Reliance team
lacked condition for one thing,
and this made them weak in
the second half. The California
men were gritty and played to
win. Johnson's playing was of
a high order. He was cool and
used good generalship through
out the game. He encouraged
his men at all times and his
words did much to make his
team play harder. The Indi
ans did better than I expected.
They had traveled thousands of
miles and were not in as good
condition as they were earlier
in the season. It was a gentle
manly game, neither side re
sorting to rough tactics. The
All-California eleven played its
game in the first half and then
they were done.â Referee YV. E.
Reed Jr. in an interview.

tators thought it was a touchdown for
Reliance, but did not reckon on the
Indian quarter's speed.
The Indians grew strong and held
the white line-buckers. Geissler kick
ed thirty yards. An overzealous Re
liance man interfered with Johnson's
fair catch and the Indians had a gift
of some of the territory between them
and the enemy's goal. Johnson made
ten yards on a quarterback run. He
was tackled so hard that he was com
pelled to rest for several minutes.
INDIANS ARE PENALIZED.
The redskins- held -in. the. line and
were set back twenty yards. Johnson
punted just that distance and Reliance
had the ball. On the second play
Lubo nailed Geissler in his tracks be
fore the white . halfback had com
menced to run. Geissler punted thirty
yards and Johnson came back five.
The ball was ten yards inside the red
skins' territory.
The aborigines gained eight yards
in two plays through Heitmuller and
at Hamilton. Sheldon with splendid
interference made thirty-five yards
around Reliance's left. end. Johnson
tried a quarterback run around Ham
ilton and gained, four yards. The In
dians gained five yards on two line
plays. Johnson made a quarterback
rim of thirteen yards and was safe
and smiling on the green sward be
hind the Reliance goal line when the
scrimmage was over. He kicked out
but failed to get the anarle when he
tt'ied for a goal.*
Geissler kicked to the goal line and
Johnson came back twenty yards Tae
fore enough men could get together to
hold him.- Charles made fifteen yards
around the end and the ball was on
the Carlisle's, thirty-five yard line
when the half was done.
INDIANS PLAY FASTER.
After a pow-wow in the center of the
field, the Indians were ready to play
the second half with greater vim. Re
liance started, this half with 'a, set of
new backs and great things were ex
pected of the heavy men. Geisaler
kicked off to the five yard line. John
son caught the ball neatly and carried
it in. ten yards before being tackled.
The Indians then began to play foot
ball. Shift plays, heavy line plunges,
cross bucks and quarterback runs were
used in forcing the palefaces back and
bringing the ball toward the All-Cali
fornia's goal. The interference used
by the Indians was re'markably good.
They followed the ball and bowled'over
their opponents in clever style. Ham
ilton and Hobbs did good work in stop
ping the gains. Johnson used great
judgment In mixing his plays. He had
the opposing, team in the. air and the
Indians 'made first down on every other
play. Geissler was .doing splendid
work when he .was knocked out and re
luctantly left the field.. Graves took
his place and immediately got: into the
game., Johnson Was hurt & number of
times, but pluckily returned to the con
test. The ball was brought toward the
goal line and Williams took it over for
During the second period thrre was
a good deal of back and forth play, and
several determined attacks were made
by both teams, but neither side scored
again. The Independent team lined up
in the following order: Chlvi-rs, goal
keeper; Mechels, left back; Armstrong,
right back; Owens, left ho!f back;
Lloyd, center half back; Forbfs, right
half back; E. Fay, outside left; Russell,
inside left; Watt, center forward; T.
Fay, inside right; T. Nolan, outside
right.
The Thistle eleven occupied the fol
lowing positions: T. Smith, goal
keeper; Tierney, left back; Forrest,
right back; Taylor, left half back; Dun
can, center half back; McGregor, right
half back; A. Disher, outride left;
Hayes, inside left; T. S. Lydon, center
forward; J. Smith, inside right; R.
Disher, outside right.
Before the Thistle-Independent game
the Occidental Regulars played against
the Occidental Tigers, each tram being
one or two men short. The Regulars
won by a score of three goals to two.
The players were: Regular team â Chlv

In danger several times. It was not un
til nearly 3:20 that they scoied their
first goal. The Thistles kept the ball
at. the Independents' end a good deal
but Mechels. at full back, relieved well.
Before the close of the first period
Disher, on the right wing, kicked a
second goal for the Thistles, which was
equalized soon after by the Independ

Dillon kicked off and Gaffey brought
the ball in a few, yards, when he was
heavily tackled. Reliance cou!d not
make her distance and Heitmuller went
back to kick. "Heiney" booted the
ball high in the air. Johnson nailed it
and slipped through Hamilton's fingers
and was downed by Cavanaugh. The
Indians soon scored another touchdown
and again Johnson kicked the goal.
Score 17 to 0. The Indians secured the
ball oivlhe kick-off and never lost it.
Their fast backs skirted the lines and
their backs bucked through guards and
tackles at will. Within another ten
minutes the fourth touchdown was
made. Johnson kicked the goal.
At this juncture. Coach Warner sent
in a fresh lot of braves. Johnson was
cheered as he took his place on the
side-lines. Dinsmore was put in by
Pete Smith and his fast work behind
the line aided his team materially. The
Reliance got the ball on the kick-off
and to the surprise of everybody made
their distance every time. They met
a plucky resistance, but they were play
ing: like demons and to save themselves
a whitewash. The Indians took a
brace when' the ball wag on their
.fifteen-yard line and secured the ball
on downs. The whistle-blew at this
.time and the game was over.

EXCITING MOMENTS IN THE FOOTBALL GAME BETWEEN THE CARLISLE INDIANS AND THE RELIANCE
ALL-CALIFORNIA TEAM WHICH WAS PLAYED ON RICHMOND FIELD YESTERDAf AFTERNOON
BEFORE A LARGE GATHERING OF FOLLOWERS OF THE GRIDIRON SPORT.
Richard Cornelius, president of the
Carmen's Union, has given out a
statement to the public in which he
explains that the carmen are not
seeking trouble, and adds that should
trouble perchance come to them thev
trtll not avoid it. In his statement he
says that Manager Chapman of the
United Railroads is attempting to
mislead the public in several things
and adds that he would like to have
the real condition understood.
Mr. Cornelius says the carmen should
have received all their back pay im
mediately, as provided for in the ar
bitration, and not in installments as
they are getting it. Mr. Cornelius
also states that there has been a great
deal of trouble in the various car
barns of the United Railroads, and
adds that some one connected with
the company is striving to disrupt the
union..

PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 25.â In a
scoreless game, which was a repetition
of the game played by the same teams
last Christmas, the Multnomah Ath
letic Club team and an eleven com
posed of varsity men and star alumni
players of the University of Oregon
struggled to a standstill in a football
match to-day on Multnomah field.
The defensive work of both teams was
so strong: that the fierce line playing
of both sides was unavailing.
The game was characterized by the
inability of the backs of either team
to make any runs and the constant
center playing resorted to was equally
unproductive of consistent gains.
Scoreless Game at Portland.
sented by the strongest team they
have ever put into the Held.
The Indians tried two center plays
and failed to gain. ' Johnson then
booted the ball sixty yards. Leadbet
ter came back ten yards and McGil
vray sprinted to the center of the field
on a farke kick. The Indians held for
downs and tot the ball. Sheldon and
Charles each made a substatial eain.
The pigskin was fumbled and Geissler
got it. He had a clear field, but had
made but thirty-five ! yards when
Johnson pulled him down. ' The spec-
The beginning of the game was ex _
citing. It took some time to pick the
winner. The Indians won the toss and
kicked off. Reliance ca'rried the ball
back forty-five yards without losing
it. Martin, Mueller, Geissler and Heit
muller were all good for substantial
gains. Carlisle's coach began to look
serious. Johnson gave his men a
talk between two downs and the red
skins held three times on their thirty
five yard line.
FIGHT FIERCE AT FIRST.
Heitmuller played an excellent game
at tackle. Hamilton did nobly at end
for a part of the game, but it took him
quite a while to start. Charles and
Williams were next in line for honors
on the Carlisle team after Johnson.
The one great disappointment of the
game was that Dillon did not put the
ball under his sweater and run the
length of the field for a touchdown.
The Indians were much better on the
offensive than defensively. Their line
was none too strong. Exactly the same
condition prevailed on the side of the
opponents. This year's Stanford team
would have played a pretty and an
even game with the redskins from the
East. . . .
Reliance fumbled only two or three
times and the .Indians but once. The
whites tackled too high af^times. The
redskins laid hold of the man with the
ball as a terrier grabs a ra,t. The In
dians' interference was absolutely with
out flaw. Some one was always ahead
of the runner to bowl over an op
ponent. Reliance was fair on interfer
ence, but showed lack of practice in
this respect. The play throughout was
clean and without slugging or rough
work.
"Billy" Reid as referee and Major
Collins as umpire gave entire satisfac
tion, both to. the teams and to the
spectators. Both men were as fast as
the Indians and conducted the game
in splendid shape. The other officials
performed their labors in a competent
manner. The field *was perfect. The
weather could not have been better.
OFFICIALS WELL CHOSEN.
.}Â«_ , j.
played well for Reliance at quarter, but
his work, of course, cannot compare
with that of Johnson. Dinsmore did
particularly well at line plunging after
he got into the game. The Indian
halves found the line rather solid.
On the point of punting the teams
seemed to be about evenly matched.
Johnson kicked over Leadbetter's head
once for sixty yards. Most of the punts
were too short to amount to much in
the making or prevention of scores.
There were good ends on both teams.
The redskins who occupied positions
on the extremities of the line were fast
er than the men opposite them. The
tackles were more evenly matched than
any other set of men In the formations.
Reliance had rather the better of the
argument on the Question of guards.
Nikofer Schouchuk, from the land of
the midnight sun, was too much for
Havcrmann of this year's Stanford
?*am at center. Leadbetter of Nevada
The backs on both teams were strong.
The Indians were infinitely ewjfter. The
Keliar.ce boys were not in proper con
dition and were completely done up at
the end. Their opponents were in shape
to play another game.
Reliance was much heavier. When
the whites massed they were almost
care to make a grain. The Indians made
tains through the line, but did the best
work on close-end runs. Each team
tried one fake kick. Reliance gained
twenty yards on hers. Carlisle lost
ground on hers. Otherwise the contest
v as straight football.
BACKS ARE STRONG.
The Caucasiors took seats on vacant
benches until the Indians appeared.
The aborigines finally trotted down the
field and everything was ready for the
mntert between the representatives of
Eastern and Western football-
It seemed for a time the opposing
forces were evenly matel ed. The Re
liance substitutes on the side lines and
thÂ«Â» men in the field began to gain con
fidence. Within a I hort time, however,
it was apparent to every observer that
the descendants of the original Ameri
cans were too fast for their opponents.
SENSATIONAL PLAYS ABOUND.
First a Caucasion made a long run
on a trick play and the spectators rose
as one man to their feet and yelled
wildly. Then a slippery redskin dodged
three or four whites and gained twenty
yards. The same crowd was shouting
itself hoar-e in applause. It was the
same way clear through the game.
When the Indians had made one
touchdown it was near the close of the
first half. During the second half the
visitors took the Reliance eleven off its
feet. They were as fresh as daisies and
rhafed at every delay. The whites
found the pace too fast and soon a man
vas flat after every scrimmage. Just
before the end the Californians came
to themselves foT a few minutes and
rushed the ball down the field almost
to a touchdown. While this v.-as going
on the crowd cheered heartily in the
hope that the defeat might not be so
great.
When the whistle announced that the
end had come the gleeful faced Eskimo
center from Carlisle had just taken pos
session qf the bail. The spectators
swarmed over the gridiron and every
ore of them apparently tried to grasp
the hard of one of the victorious red
skins. Johnson came in for the lion's
share of the praise and he deserved it.
There. was little betting on the game
ar.d the odds were in favor of the In
cians.
Fully sono people witnessed the game
the receipts being about $4500 The at
tendance was much heavier than had
bc-en expected. An hour before the con
test scheduled to begin the cars
Bota* in the direction of Richmond
neM were jammed with people and the
struts about the gates were black with
humanity. When the referee signaled
the Indians to kick off the spectators
in the reserved sections all had seats
and there was plenty of room to spare.
The Reliance team appeared first.
The men were arrayed in spotless new
uniforms. The jerseys were of Reli
ance red and the sleeves were eross-
Btrtped with California's blue and gold.
Across the breast of each garment was
the :egend. "All-Calif."
The cvowd of spectators was
v i!d v ith enthusiasm throughout the
contest. There was but little partisan
ship in that concourse of people, and
every piert: of spectacular work was
cheered ami cheered again. That riot
of c^lor in the grand stands charac
teristic of the intercollegiate game was
noticeably absent, and the applause
showed the lack of organization. There
*vÂ«-re no trailing banners nor aching
hearts nor speculations on "next year's
team" after the game was over.
F,ut the crowd did not trouble itself
about the absence of these features,
n hirJi are the usual attributes of a
big: battle on the gridiron. It went
to fcp. an exhibition of fine football,
and it did not come away disappoint
ed. Besides all that, it found a hero
Â«f the pigrkin. His name is James
Johnson and he plays quarterback on
th*Â» Carlisle eleven. He is as agile as
a panther and as slippery as an eel.
He keeps his nerve in the presence of
injurj, and uses his head in every
movement he makes in the course of
a game. No wonder he made the Ail-
American team without a protest- no
wonder he has led his team to victory
twelve times this season. Playfully
explanatory of the white men's de
feat yesterday, the crowd was yelling
â¢Too liurh Johnson." The phrase pret
ty nearly fells the story of the game.
ATTENDANCE IS HEAVY.
The Carlisle Indian football eleven
carried off all the scalps yesterday at
Richmond field. The Reliar.ce-A!l
<"alifornin team was never in the run
rinjr. The Caucasians nearly scored a
touchdown after the redskins had piled
up a score of 23 points, but the flght
had been won by that time. It was
the best frame of football seen on the
Pacific Ooast this year despite its be
ing one-sided. Kaoh half was full of
:-f-usational plays. Long runs were the
i - Jle instead of the exception. Brilliant
individual v.ork by the members of
the opposing forces was continually
epparem.

Corbett disappointed those of his vis

IT was a good game and I
enjoyed it Immensely. I
was not alarmed when, the
Reliance team started to carry
the ball down the field in the
first half, as I knew it could
not last. The men were much
heavier than the Indians and
1 knew that when we gained
the ball we would score. The
Indians always play . a fast
game. The men who composed
the Reliance eleven were good
players, but lacked proper
training. With good coaching
they would do well against the
Middle West aggregations.
Football on this coast does not
differ much from that played
in the East. The teams out
here are fast and understand
the game. Ileitmuller, who
played right tackle for Reli
ance, is a good player. Most
of the gains made by Reliance
were through left guard and
tackle. â Coach Warner in an

Ada N dropped from the clouds and
won the concluding race of the after
noon, a mile selling affair, with a field
of nine starting. The mare was sore
in the shoulders as usual, and leaving
the barrier so slowly it looked as if
she had been left at the post. Down
the back stretch she looked a 100 to 1
chance, but from the half-mile ground
began mowing down her field. Less

NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Besides twenty-seven books in the

it was announced that the first two
year-old race of the new year would
be run on January 1. It should have
read January 4.

Mountebank, piloted by Jack Martin
and a' 6 to" 1 chance, led Matt Hogan
out in the six-furlong selling number,
nÂ«xt decided. Aunt Polly, at ,13 to 5,
had first call ia the beating and' led
the bunch into the stretch.. She began
tiring a furlong from home, and fin
ished th'rd. To-mmy Burns, on Matt
Hogan. was pocketed most of the route
and in a mile drive Mountebank, beat
the Magrane entry half a length.
â¢Following the handicap came a
seven-furlong selling run, for ) which
Redwald, ridden by, .Burns, closed a
slight favorite' over Saintly. .Redwald
was prominent a. good portion of/the
route, but his rickety underpinning
could not stand the wear and tear and
he ran unplaced. Louis Wagner made
bridge at her heels. Jack Martin laid
away in sixth position with Proper. At
the end of a mile Falconbridge was
leading and the favorite had moved up
to second place. For "a time it looked
as if Falconbridge would land the prize,
but when Martin drewi his whip the
favorite seemed -aroused from a slum
ber, for he assumed the lead a furlong
from the goal, and at the wire won eas
ily in 2:06. Falconbridge was hard
pressed the last hundred yards by
Divina; the mare only losing the place
by half a length. Claude was 'a ; close
fourth. Wonderly made no move with
Oarsman, finishing last. As the. track
could not be called lightning last,- the
winner's performance stamps him ! as
about the best horse in thes.? parts.
All of the fields had an open lf.ok, and
the bookmakers were not afflicted .with
two-horse plays. Besides Proper the
only other winning choice was Sou
friere. Lurene'was the longest priced
winner.
Eleven ordinary selling platers start
ed in the opening six-furlorife. event.
Ulllouon was made favorite with a
slight call over Amasa and Myrtle H.
but could finish no closer up than third.
Lurene. a 12 to l sho;, outstayed
Amasa. winning cleverly iyy a length
and a half. C. Kelly rode thy winner.
In the five and a half furlong scram
ble for -two-year-old fillies Dayton &
Co.'s useful performer Soufriere scored
her third consecutive victory. The
daughter of Inspector . B had Hilde
brand in the saddle, and ruled favorite
in the betting' over Gottllebeh and Ef

cence showed the way into the stretch
Here Hildebrand managed to squeeze
through c-n the fail with, the favorite,

colt enjoyed the honors of favoritism;
several of the other starters had an ex

top impost of 123 pounds and a fine
record behind it, had admirers by. the
score. The New Yorkers unloaded

Nothing but the furs worn by the
fashionably attired women who com
prised a good portion of the great
holiday gathering of nearly ten thous
and people at Ingleside track yesterday
reflected a reminder that it was mid
winter.
' While poor old Santa Claus had to
thaw out the icicles from his whiskers
over an immense self-feeding coal stovv
in the eastern country, after his duties
wore fulfilled on Christmas eve, the
sun shone brightly at Ingleside, the
fiowers bloomed as in May time and
the weather was too. warm for even a
light top coat.
The weather was the least of the
troubles of the big throng. It was
winners and the coin of the bookmak
ers most of them sought. The hopes
of some were realized, others returned
home with an empty stocking, to dine
on frankfurters instead of the edible
turkey. 1
When Proper, the 3 to 1 favorite with
Jack Martin on his back, brought home
the rich Christmas handicap at one
and one-quarter miles, the crowd went
wild and the bookies ehed" tears large
as chestnuts. This was an event
worth trying for, as the ; first horse
took $3615 as his share of the stake,
with a gross valuation of $4540. '

Herbert Schmidt and Harry Rolfe
again took J. D. MacGavin and Frank
Mitchell into camp, and with a smaller
handicap than last time. The scratch
team was rather wild and threw away
its chance in the second set, when it
led at 5â3. Schmidt and Rolfe play*d
a steady game and won mostly on their
opponents' errors.
One other match was played in the
first round, and it proved the closest
of the day. Sidney Salisbury and
Frank Stringham allowed A. Beyfuss
and Harry McAfee odds of "over 3-6"
and give "15 and 3-6." After each had
taken a set rather easily the third de
veloped into a long-drawn-out affair,
which required sixteen games to settle.
The remaining matches will be played
to-morrow. The matches played result
ed as follows:
Ray Splivalo and Ray Cornell allowed
Sidney Smith and Alden Ames the
heavy odds of "15 and 3-6" and won
after a hard struggle.
Another close match in this round
was that in which Dan Volkmann and
Herbert Gray beat Will Volkmann and
Douglass Grant. The former received
"3-6."
Thirteen teams competed on the Cali
fornia tennis courts yesterday morning
for the challenge cups. The handicap
ping was well done and nearly all of
the matches were close.
The best match in the preliminary
round was that between the Long
brothers and C. J. Smith and Will Col
lier. The latter allowed their oppo
nents odds of "owe 5-6" and "give 2-6."
The -Long brothers played good tennis
and won the first set, 6 â I. Smith and
Collier picked up in the last two sets
and won out. The match was close, al
though the score would indicate a one
sided contest. Collier and Smith worked
well together considering it was their
first appearance as a team.

The members of Camp Reinhold
Richter, Spanish- American. War Vet
erans, have started an investigation
regarding the interment of Sergeant
William Fogarty and the subsequent
attempt to â¢' use a coffin case bearing
his name for the burial of Mrs. Cath
erjiie Keefe in this city a few days
ago. ! The investigating committee
has dispatched a' telegram to Presi
dent Roosevelt asking him to help
them ' to unravel the mystery as a
member of the Spanish-American
War . Veterans.
It is the opinion of .those who are
investigating: the case that the ooay
of Fogarty was never interred at all,
but that- it was given over' to some
medical college. George Lacomiw,
superintendent of Holy Cross Ceme
tery, states that -Fogarty's - remair.3
were Interred at the cemetery on Feo
ruary 6, 1901: It.is thought by tlio
investigators that an. empty- coffin was
lowered into the grave and the body
given to a medical college.
-As yet the investigators have n->t
been able to locate the undertaker to
whom the ; ,body of' Fogarty was sent
in this city. An attempt will -be made
to find^him' and" he.. will" be asked to
explain how the' coffin was' turned
over to another undertaking'; firm.

a great time diving under breakers and
bobbing around like . so ' many . corks.

ATHLETES SWIM IX OCEAX.
While the inhabitants of . Eastern
cities shivered and ' gathered around
fires to keep warm . on Christmas day,
the. people of San .Francisco .enjoyed
sunshine and went outdoors without
overcoats. While blocks of ice filled the
rivers and snow covered the roads in
the East, making travel difficult to the
Easterners, their Western friends-were
enjoying drives over smooth roads and
bathing ir. the ocean.
Probably the best inducement to
shivering humanity to come to this
State and enjoy its balmy climate is a
report of yesterday's weather. >In many
parts of the world, and especially in
such cities as St. Louis, Cincinnati,

I. Epstein, a pawnbroker at â¬20 Clay
Ftr<=-et. reported to the police last night
that htettow window had been broken
in on the morning of December 23 and a
lot of silver and gold watches stolen.
Enrtein was unable to fix the exact
value of the stolen poods, bu: said the
theft would leave him loser r.bout $200.
The pawnbroker think? he will be able
to identify the burglars should they
hn captured. He says three men were
seen by him loafing in front of the win
dow an hour or fo before the watches
vere stolen. Epstein had a good view
Â«>f the men ar.d says that he will know

Paul Licata of 431 Fra.nc'i3co street
rr-povted to the police last nisht that
th^ pasoline engine from the boat from
which the Girardi brothers were drown
ed last Tuesday had been stolen from
the boat. The engine was missed on
Thursday morning. It had been in the
hoa^ which was lying on the beach,
the day before. Detectives were de
tailed to pee whether they cr.uld find
the missing engine.
Mrs. Annie Burns of 725 Washington
Ftreet went into Clark's Bakery on
Kearny street r.ear Commercial to pur
chase some bread. While showing the
clerk ihr- kind of that edible she "wished,
en unscrupulous individual pocketed
her purse, which fhe had foolishly laid
Â«in the counter, and made his exit.
Th*Â» pursp contained $10 TÂ»0 and a rum
lirr of keys and receipts.
The usual number of Christmas holi
day â¢â¢touches" have come to the notice
of the police. Many cases of piekpock
eting on street cars and other places
were reported yesterday. In each case
xhe amounts were small, being limited
to the actual value of the contents of
;he purses stolen. A pawnbroker re
ports that his show w indow was broken
in and a number of gold and silver
watches were stolen. A gasoline en
gine was removed from the boat from
which the two fishermen were drowned
on Tuesday.
T. F. Monaghan of 225 Fourteenth
street was riding on a Mission street
i-ar Thursday night. When between
Xinth ar.d Eleventh streets a light-fin
pered crook extracted Monaghan's
t.ocketbook, containing SIS in coin,
ilonaghan did not discover, the theft
until he had reached his home. He then
remembered that he had been Jostled
by a tousrh-looking character, and at
once connected the stranger with the
etealing of his money.
Testfrday afternoon W. Xelson of
302'* Vermont street reported to the
police that he had been relieved of a
purse containing $7 and some trinkets
Â¦<vh;]e riding on a Hayes-street car.
Xelson told the same 'jostling" story
and the police are of the opinion that
ihf two thefts were performed by the
Fame cranks. In each case the pres
ence of a 'stall" was noticed by the
passengers on the cars. The "stall's"
part would be to engage the attention
of the party selected for a victim and
while the nvan was engaged the pal
would relieve him of his valuable?.

pave hi? lr.ite to the '"Christmas cheer"
of thf pickpockets by an involuntary

$12 Gaffke was going home on a
south-bound Montgomery-street car,
when the crooks worked him for his

salesman time and trouble, but its
provision- that scrip- must be ex

Furthermore, it is not good except on

transact other important business.

south of the Columbia and another on

Special Dispatch to The Call
The Coroner's office was notified and
the body removed to the morgue. There
It was found that the wheels had
passed over the unfortunate's rbdomen,
practically severing the lower extrem
ities from the trunk. There was noth
ing found in the pocke:s of the de
ceased that throws any light upon his
identity. The body is that of a man
about thirty years of age and from
the dress appears to be that of a labor
er. The clothes bear the label of Heese
man & Co., Oakland.
G. XV. Lane, motorman of the car
that ended the unfortunate's life," was
arrested by Patrolman Kelson and
booked at the City Prison on a charge
of manslaughter. He was subsequently
released on bail. His version of the
accident agrees with that of the other
eye witnesses.
As car Xo. 1145 of the Kearny and
Mission streets line, in charge cf Motor
man G. "U*. Lane, was descending the
incline on Kearny street, between
Broadway and Pacific street, the un
fortunate man that met his dtath was
standing on the curb, on the west side
of Kearny street, consider: 1 . faly under
the influence of liquor. Moiorman
Lane, as he approached Pacific street,
applied his brakes preparatory to
bringing his car to a stop. At ' this
juncture, the unknown man suddenly
reeled and fell directly in the oath of
the car. Before the car could be stopped
one of the wheels of the 'rent trucfc
had passed over him.
Patrolmen Xelson and Joy were im
mediately upon the scene and it was
seen that it would be necessary to raise
the car before the body could be re
moved. Truck Company Xo. 2 at C27
Broadway was notified and responded
to the call. The firemen went to work
with a will and by use of jacM 1 ? to raise
the car and axes .to chop away the
steps, extricated the body. V crowd of
several thousand morbidly inclined peo
ple had gathered and great excitement
reigned.
A shocking tragedy occurred last
evening at half past 5 o'clock at the
corner of Kearny and Pacific streets,
when the life of an unknown man was
ground out beneath the wheels of an
electric car.

"Twice a year, on April 23 and Oc
tober 26," writes a young Bulgarian
woman living in Sofia, "our streets are
full of servants, and people bargain
with them for service. During the
winter season they are very cheap, as
the peasants send all their girls to the
city to be hired, they having no work
for them at home.. The price paid dif
fers. One can get a girl for her board
or pay up to 20 lusor ($4) a month
for one who cooks, washes and irons.
Girls are often thankful to enter a
good family for. their board. For the
men there is very little work, and the
papers are full of suicides on account
during the dull seasons of starvation."

One has but to look back through
history to see how closely related is
the, forest to human vitality. It was
In the forests of Thessaly that the
early Greeks received their energy that
later flowered into genius. It was the
forest dwellers of Germany that con
quered decadent Rome and later gave
to Spain the vigor that swept back the
Moor and .brought under her flag al
most the whole known world. But to
day what is Greece, what is Italy, what
is Spain? They have been stripped of
their forests, those nurseries of vigor,
and their decay has set in. Every
where-the law holds good. It is in
the forest that the manhood is nour
ished which builds up great civiliza
tions. But cities arise, trees are swept
away, and the inevitable decline sets
In. Forests once destroyed cannot re
turn, and over all the sites of ancient
civilization are blowing the desert
sands.â New- York Times.
Forests and Human Vitality.
To show its appreciation of the part
being taken by Canada in the celebra
tion of the centenary of the British
and Foreign Bible Society, three of its
ablest and most eloquent supporters
are in Canada as special delegates.
They are the Venerable Archdeacon
Madden of Liverpool, the Rev. G. H.
Bondfleld, the society's representive in
China, and Sir Algernon Coote, pre
mier baronet of Ireland and one of the
society's vice presidents.
Sunday evening Archdeacon Madden
spoke in the Church of the Epiphany,
saying that tthe Bible Society during
the hundred years of its existence had
distributed throughout the world 1S0.
000,000 Bibles, printed In 370 different
languages. Last year it gave out 6,000,
000 Bibles and .portions of Bibles.
The enormous work of this society was
apparent when it was known that a
century ago only 4,000,000 copies of the
book were in existence. Now there are
200,000,000 copies of it in the world.
The Rev. . G. H. .Bondfield spoke at
the Metropolitan Church and at West
minster Presbyterian Church. Among
the significant facts he presented was
that notwithstanding the 370 languages
in which the Bible is circulated, there
are .In India 102 languages into which
no part of the scriptures has been
translated. In the South Seas, out of
127 languages the Bible has been trans
lated Into only 46 of them. Similar
conditions were true cf China, South
America, where there are 300 Indian
dialects, and of other portions of the
world. â Toronto Mall and Express.

INTO MILLIONS
The King of Siam, whose jubilee is
being celebrated with unprecedented
magnificence in Bangkok, is only 83
years of age, for' he ascended the
throne at 13. Mrs. Leonowen, an Eng
lish governess, whose pupil he was
for six years, described him as an apt
scholar, handsome, affectionate and
generous, with lofty ideals. Chula
longkorn has verified that character
by progressive rule. He has given

It wc-uid be difficult to find anywhere
in the development of industrial affairs
a parallel where there has been such a
marvelous advance all along the 1 lines
of commerce as is indicated by the fig
ures showing the increases, as above
stated, during the year.
Indeed, viewing these matters from
any point desired, this great common
carrier system, in all that pertains to
transportation, is the most formidable
one in the. world.
In the perfection of facilities, com
forts, conveniences, promptitude of ser
vice, reasonableness of charges, our
railroads are par excellence. So, too,
may it be said that there is no terri
tory in these United States or else
where in which there exist such won
derful and almost limitless lines of in
dustries and such Inexhaustible mate
rial interests as are found along these
great highways of commerce, these
transportation lines that make up the
railroad system of the State of Penn
sylvania.â Philadelphia Public Ledger.

AN" UNPARALLELED RECORD.
"Xot needed. If yoff have good luck
send a goose," was Tawney's laconic
telegraphic answer.
The Pennsylvania absentee turned
up in Washington the next day laden
with game. He had taken good care
to secure a goose, and withal many fat
ducks. The goose, of course, was for
Tawney, the whip, who had treated
him so handsomely, and there was a
brace of ducks io the bargain, with
enough left over to provide amply for
the other statesmen already noted. â
Washington Post.
Theso larpe possessions of game all
came about through one of the nim
rods of the House. Representative
P.thner of Pennsylvania. He finds it
pleasant to tramp through the marshes
and waylay the birds of the air. Last
week Mr. Palmer journeyed south to
Currituck Sound, X. C. while the
Democrats were debating Cuban tariff
schedules ad inflnitum. As the day for
voting approached Mr. Palmer indited
a message to Mr. Hawriey. It sim
ply said:
"Do you need me?" or words to that
effect.
Senator Quay recently had a brace
of fine ducks. So had Speaker Can
non, Payne and Dalzell of the House.
Tawney of Minnesota likewise had
ducks and other game. They were
part of his perquisites as Republican
whip, and last evening he made merry
at dinner with a party of friends called
]n to aid in the consumption of his
aforesaid perquisites.

Mx?Et of the vessels alongside the
wharves were drc-ssed in bright bunt
ing, and nearly every British sailing
ship had a Christmas tree lashed to
the masthead. .A large number of ap
prentices from the British ships in port
v.ere entertained at the Seamen's In
stitute, and signs of work were con
spicuous by their absence frcm one end
of the water front to the o>lier.
The bright sunshine of yesterday
made out-of-doors attractive, and the
Tiresenre in the harbor of the cruiser
â¢New York drew larpe crowds to the
water front. Throughout the afternoon
'aunch after launch loaded with pa- j
triotic sightseers traveled from shore |
to ship. The fact that the New York j
loaves to-day for Panama added to the i
interest of the occasion, and the cruis- Â¦
ffs officers, although busy with prepa- j
rations for the coming voyage, found [
time to extend a Christmas welcome ]
*.Â¦> all that visited the ship. '
The Bennington, also under orders to I
eo 'o the isthmus, went to the navy i
jiird Thursday. The New York's prtva- <
rations for sea. although hurried, have |
hf-cn complete, and Admiral Glass will j
find in the cruiser a well-found, com
fsrtahle tlag^hip.
Th^ Nov.- fork was not the only ob-
J*ct of attraction. For every visitor
ihat -.vent out to the warship a dozen j
paraded the wharves, and the bulkhead ;
:::iÂ» from Meiggs v hart to the Pacific!
Mail drÂ»ck presented the appearance of j
a fashionable promenade. The fakers, j
in evidence every fine Sunday, made
the most of the fresh-air seeking
( rowds and appeared to be doing quite
an extensive business.

In the capitalization of railways there
has been an increase during the year of
$364,098,739. Tlfere has been Mn Increase
In all the classification of nhipments,
in the tables indicating the liabilities
and assets, the mileage, the persons
employed and their compensation, the
number of passengers and- tons 1 of
freight carried; in the earnings and in
come and in the expenses of mainte
nance and operation, there is the most
unassailable and irrefutable evidence
of the prosperity of the industries lo
cated along the great arteries of the
commerce of this Pennsylvania system
of transportation. The ravorable con
ditions which exist among the miners,
the mechanics, the bankers, the profes
sional men, the merchants, thv 'artisans
and laborers of all classifications, are
seen also in the increase of all the sal
ient features, financial operations an d
business transactions of this great
common carrier system. For increase
of business in, . the , way of transporta
tion, means that the. conditions of all
business enterprises are favorable.
RAILWAY CAPITALIZATION.
Â¦In maintaining this railway system,
in betterments and improvements and
in operation the following amounts
have been expended during the year:
Maintenance of way and structures,
$75,646,164; maintenance of equipment,
$85,160,879; conducting transportation,
$223,295,443; general expenses, $12,671,-
C60; total operating expenses, $396",774,
146; other expenses, $171,957,484; total
expenses, $568,731,630.
From the receipts and income the
stockholders have received dividends
during the year amounting to $50,124,
'433. Â¦ .
The carrying of passengers has pro
duced an income of $146,759,653; freight
earnings, $433,672,578; other earnings
from operation, $11,988,353, or a total
earnings from operation' of $592,420,584.
Other income from dividends on stocks,
interest on bonds owned, etc., was $62,
168,034, or a total earnings and income
of $654,588,618.
EXPENSES AND DIVIDENDS.
There have been carried" during the
year 2C0.118.781 passengers, which being
reduced to a mileage basis is an equiva
lent of having carried 6,469,371,275 per
sons one mile.
Of frfight, the number of tons car
ried as products of agriculture was
36,013.410; products of animals, 10,656,'
5S2; products of mines, 339,657,313; prod
ucts of forests, 25,421,537; produces of
manufactories, 105,161,904; merchandise,
15,279,160; miscellaneous shipments, 30,
099,624, or a total tonnage of 566,189.530.
This tonnage, reduced to a single mile
basis, is equivalent to having carried
67,512,663,391 tons one mile. These fig
ures indicate the immensity of the pro
ductions of this State in a most re
markable manner.
The handling of this equipment ant
the conducting of the business of thi:
system have given employment to 419,
5S1 persons, an industrial army o
bread winners, all engaged in the con
struction, maintenance and operatioi
of transportation corporations, t<
whom there was paid during the yea;
covered by this report, $254,116,S25.
Another evidence of the great servici
rendered by transportation corpora
tions is found in the figures showini
the train mileage b>* passenger am
freight trains, the former being* 119,
092,411; freight trains. 155.456,091 miles
and mixed trains, 3.336,549 miles, or t
total train mileage of 277,SS5,054.

telegraph and telephone corporations,
whose lines have not yet been con
atructed. .
Compiling the reports from all thes<
railroad corporations, and considering
them as representing one railroad sys
tem in Pennsylvania, we' present - fig
ures which exhibit the marvelous mag
nitude of this common carrier systetr
that conducts the transportation ol
persons and commodities within â¢ the
State of Pennsylvania and the territory
adjacent thereto.
The combined amount*. of liabilities
of the several corporations which art
factors in this great transportatior
system are a? follows: Capital : stocfc
outstanding, 51.673.S26.362; -funded in
debtedness, $1,533,658,571; other forms o

capitalization of $3,601,225,332. This pro
digious sum represents the capitaliza

The death of McDonald rids the city
of a dangerous character. His career
was a checkered one, and he was

The seller is Mrs. Mary Cunningham
Bishop of Xew York. Formerly the
property was owned by James Cun
ningham, from whom it passed to Mrs.
Bishop. The frontage on Market and
Stevenson streets is 142:6 feet. The lot,
running back on Annie street to Stev->
enson. is- ICO feet deep. It is the site
that, has been purchased rather than
the building. As soon a3 the present
leases run out! but no sooner, Mr. Law.
will proceed to demolish . the present
structure, which, in his view, encum-;
bers the ground, although the annual
rentals amount to $60,000.-
Mr. Law. has bought to build a great
structure on Market street.-Concern
ing the sort of building that he will
erect he does not speak.; "it Js defi
nitely known that he intends, to orna
ment Market street in a manner, be
fitting the central thoroughfare of San
Francisco. Mr. Law built the' FJalto
building on New Montgomery street
and is the owner of other large prop
erties in this city. The character of
improvements already made by, him is
an earnest of what he will do with his
property on Market . street. . Â¦', ,
The deal for the Bishop property was
conducted by Thomas Magee & Sons;,
representing Herbert E. Law, and by
Shainwald, Buckbee & Co., represent*
ing Mrs. Bishop. The negotiations
have been quietly proceeding for Vonie
time. .A few years ago Mrs. Blshopr
expended $50,000 in. improving the pres
ent building, the eligibility of the site
for business purposes fully warranting
that outlay. Considering the great
frontage on Market street of 142:6 feet,
it is probable that Mr. Law, while
practically throwing away at the end
of the leases now running the value of
the present structure, which is worth
from $250,000 to $300,000, will Invest at
least $1,000,000 in building and so bring
up his investment to $2,000,000.

Herbert E. Law has bought the Bish

It runs through to Stevenson street.
The rate paid for the Mackay prop

Young Bernard Spcckroan lies Down
on a Railroad Crossing and
Forfeits His Life.
Bernard Speckman, a... maker of
surgical instruments, 22 years of age,
was struck and instantly killed yes
terday morning at the crossing of
Twenty-eighth and Duncan streets by
the locomotive of passenger train No.
37 of the Southern Pacific Company.
Speckman lived at 1453 Church
street and was on his way home at
the time the accident occurred. Ches
ley Brown of 1614 Church street in
formed Deputy Coroner Charles Mee
han that at 10:30 a. m. he saw Speck
man considerably. under the influence
of liquor sitting on the railroad track
at the place where he was killed. The
passenger train came along shortly
afterward and struck Speckman,
fracturing his skull.
M. E. Montgomery, engineer of the
train, stated that he blew the whistle
and set the air brakes as soon as he
saw Speckman lying on the track, but
that the train could not be stopped in
time to prevent the engine striking the
prostrate man.
The concern is a coffee and spice
house, which has been in business for
a long term of years and is well known
on the coast. S. H. Tyler, who lives
in Mill Valley, could hot be found yes
terday to give an estimate of his loss
on stock. One of his employes stated
that, it would not be less than $15,000.

Gilbert, a hoseman on" Engine No. 12,
was, struck on the hand by a piece, of
glass from one of the shattered win
dows." His. thumb was. severely cut
and he was removed to the Harbor Hos
pital for treatment. ' .'/
The building was a three-story brick
with an additional floor built on top
of frame material. Evidently the fire
started on the third floor, wl\ere some
coffee roasters are located. The place
was locked up Wednesday night and
the fires banked. The fire department
believes the blaze resulted from the
banked fires.
The entire premises at SOS Front
street, occupied by. S. H."Ty!er & Son,
were gutted by fire yesterday morning.
The conflagration was discovered by
Policeman Charles Murphy, who no
ticed volumes of smo&e pouring from
the third floor of . the building and
turned in an alarm. When Chief Sul
livan arrived the flames .were burning
so furiously that he turned in a second
alarm for fear that adjoining property
might be- ignited.
Despite the exertions, of the depart
ment, "which worked under great diffi
culties, due to the immense volumes
of smoke, the flames spread untir every
floor in the building was burned out
and the structure left" with four bare
walls. .

outstripped the others, soon drew a
line on him and fired two shots over

flight, but ran into the arms of Police

The footpad with the revolver
promptly pulled the trigger and almost
by a miracle the bullet missed Johnson
and lodged in the fence near where they
were standing. The footpads appar

Johnson ran after ihe one who had the
revolver and the footpad wheeled

The Johnson brothers, who live at 116
Kerry street, went to an oyster house on
Third street Fhortly before midnight to
have something to eat. They left about
â¢ me o'clock yesterday morning to go
home and as they turned into Silver
street they were confronted by three
men. One of the trio knocked George
down by a blow on tho face with his
list and went through his pockets, but
found no coin.
Par.iol and George Johnson, brothers
and sailors, had an exciting experience
with three footpads at an early hour
yesterday morning on Third street,
n^ar Silver.
Patrolmen McPartland and Henner
berry were in the" vicinity with the pa
trol wagon and heard the shots. They
hurried to the scene and arrived just
as McDonald fell to the ground. Mc-
Partland gave a wonderful exhibition
of nerve and coolness. He jumped
from the wagon, rushing up to the .in
furiated Atkins, snatched the still
smoking weapon from his hand Just as
he was about to fire again at the pros
trate form of his victim.
McDonald was picked up and hur
ried to the Harbor Hospital a few
blocks away. As he was being placed
upon the operating table he breathed
his last without" saying a word. He
tried to speak, but the cold hand of
death clutched him tightly ere he could
utter the. words.
One bullet entered McDonald's back
and penetrated the heart. Another en
tered three inches below and lodged
against a rib. Either wound would
have been fatal, as both, ruptured
large blood vessels.
The prisoner was taken to the harbor
police station. The realization of his
crime seemed to sober him up, but he
still remained cool and talked readily
Then Atkins grew desperate and,
hurrying back to his room, secured his
big 38-caliber revolver and again start
ed after McDonald. He overtook the
latter near the Washington street dock
and this time pleaded for his coin.
McDonald again answered in the neg
ative, at the same time threatening to
beat the cook to death if he did not
move along.
Then Atkins deliberately pulled the
weapon out of his pocket and, taking
refuge behind a telegraph" pole, began
to shoot. McDonald started to run,
but the first bullet fired by Atkins
staggered him and as he was about to
fall his slayer fired again, the second
ball entering his victim's back a few
inches from the first.
Nor was the infuriated man yet sat^
isfled. As his victim lay on the street,
struggling In the throes of death, At
kins again fired. This time the bullet
went wide of its mark and striking the
ground it glanced off, again and struck
James Anderson, a young locksmith,
in the calf of the leg.
McPARTIiANTVS BRAVERY.
McDonald had always been regarded
as a so-rCfif king among the low negroes
of the coast and consequently he did
much as he pleased with them. Atkins
feared the pugilist, but also wanted his
money back, so he requested McDonald
to return the coin. ,
The pugilist refused, saying: "I took
this with my 190 pounds of hard flesh
and there aint no nigger living who can
got it back again. Good-by!" With
this he "left the place and started to
walk to the ferry. Atkins followed
him outside and again asked for the re
turn of the money, but McDonald ig
nored him.
PLEADS FOR HIS MONEY.
Charles McDonald, better known as
prizefighter, crook and all
around bad man, was killed in a dra
matic manner by William H. Atkins,
a colored cook, shortly after 1 o'clock
yesterday afternoon, near "Washington
street wharf. The slayer fired thrice,
two of^ the bullets entering McDonald's
body and the third striking Julea An
derson, an innocent bystander. But for
the bravery displayed by 1 Patrolman
P. D. McPartland, the desperate negro
might have taken more lives, for large
crowds of people were passing alonjr
the wharves at the time.
The shooting was the result of a
quarrel over the paltry sum of $1 35,
which McDonald had taken away from
the man who afterward 6hot him. It
was the finale of a Christmas eve ca
rousal, the man who fired the fatal
shc-ts being much the worse for lkii-'or
when he ended the pugilist's life.
Atkins is a cook by occupation, but
has been out of employment for many
months, and he usually whiled away
his leisure in one of the many low re
ports that beset the Karbary Coast.
He rooms at the Wisconsin Hotel.
Atkins was engaged in a game of
cards In the barroom of the place with
Charles Bullen, the bartender. Luck
seemed to favor Atkins and finally he
won $1 35, which he deposited In front
of him on the card table.
Bullen got up and went behind ihe
bar for a moment, and at the same
time "McDonald entered the place. He
walked over to the table, deliberately
picked up the .money, placed it in hl3
pocket and started to walk out the
door.
