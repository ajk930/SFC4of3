"That Scotch whisky la good In some
of the lesser emergencies." remarked F'er
ctval, turning to her; "but It has Us lim
itations. Let's you and me tr.Ue with a
nico cold quart of champagne!"
"Oh!" from Mrs. Aktmit. again In an ec
stasy, "he's playing that heavenly stuff
from the second act of 'Tristan and
Isolde'â the one triumphant, perfect love
poem of all music."
"Miss Milbrey has stayed by the organ
ist," sa.d one; "and she's promised ,to
make him play one r.iore. Isn't ha di
vine?"
The music came again. 4
"I beg pardon!"
"There have been rumors lots of times
that he was going to be unmarried, but
they always seem to adjust their little"
difficulties. He and his wife are now stay-
Ing over at the Bloynes."
"Oh! I see," answered Percival; "you're
a jester, Mrs. Drelmer."
"Ristlne," observed the theosophic Wil
berforce, In the manner of a hired oracle,
"is, in his present incarnation, imperfect
ly monogamous."
Some people came In from the music
room.
"He's Improvising." exclaimed Mrs.
Akemlt. "How splendid! He teems to be
breathing a paean of triumph, some
high, exalted spiritual triumph, as If his
soul had risen above usâ how precious!"
When the deep swell had subsided to sil
very rlpUs and the last cadence had
fainted, she looked at Percival with mois
tened parted lips and eyes half-shielded,
as If her full gaze would betray too much
of her quivering soul.
Then Percival heard the turquolsed bru
nette say: "What a pity his wife is such
an unsympathetic creature!"
"But Mr. Kistine is unmarried, is he
not?" he asked, quickly.
There was a little laugh from Mrs.
Drelmer.
"Not yetâ not that I've heard Â«f."
"The pen have to be brave." she an
swered, shortly, with a glance at little
Mrs. Akemlt, who had permitted Percival
to seat her at his side, and was now
pleading with him to agree that simple
ways of 'life are requisite to the needed
measure of spirituality.
Then came strains of music from the
rich- toned organ.
"Oh, that dear Ned Rlstine is playing,
cried one. and several of the group saun
tered toward the music-room.-
The music flooded the hall and J the
room, so that the talk died low. -

unexplalnable Instinct, making itself
known In a thrill that went from his, feet
to his head: he could feel the roots of
his hair tingle. The'' newcomer went
quickly, with catlike tread, toward the

He tried to stop breathing, fearful of
discovery, graspir.g with one hand the
heavy fold of the curtain back of him to
steady hlmse'.f.
Thrre was the Â«nnce of two lonsr. tremD

Above the clatter of the table could be
heard the voices of men and the musical

saw her take a lighted candle from one
of the laughing girls and go toward the
library. - ".:
HIs heart-beats quickened. Now she
should know his love and It would be
well. He;walked down the hall leisurely,
turned into tha big parlor, momentarily
deserted, walked quickly but softly over
Its polished floor to a door that gave Into
the library, pushed the heavy portiere
aside and stepped noiselessly In. .
The large room was lighted dimly by
two Immense yellow 'pumpkins, their sides
cut Into faces of grinning grotesqueness.
At the far side of the room Miss Mllbrey
had that instant arrived before an antique
oval mirror whose gilded carvings reflect
ed the light of the candle. She held It
above her head with one rounded arm.
He stood In deep shadow and the girl had
been too absorbed in the play to note his
coming. He took one noiseless step to
ward her. but then through the curtained
doorway bv which she had come he saw
a man enter swiftly and furtively. .'
"Our young friend Bines Is a specimen.

their law of entail, the same process is
unswifterâ yet does It unvary. The poor
aristocrats, almost back to shirt sleeves,
with their taxes and entailed lands, seek
for the money in shops of dress and bon
net-and ale, and graciously rent their
castles to the but-newly-opulent In Amer

Here the posterity of your Mynherr.

they boast was a toller, a market garden
er, "a fur trader, a boatman, hard work

descendants upon the savings of these la
bors have forgotten how to labor them
selves. They could rot yet produce should
they even relinquish the illusion that to
produce is of a baseness, that only to
consume Is noble. I gather reports that
a few retain enough of the ancient strain
to become sturdy tradesmen and garden

turn, will become impoverished and help
less. Ah, what beautiful showing of Evo

The learned doctor submitted to hav^
his glass refilled from the cooler at his
side, dropped another olive into the wine,
and resumedrbefore Oidaker could manage
an escape.
"And how long, you ask. shall the cos
mic pendulum swing between these ex
tremes of penurious Industry and opulent
Idleness?"
Oidaker had not asked it. But he tried
politely to appear as if he had meant to.
He had really meant to as* the doctor
what time It was and then pretend to re
call an engagement for which he wou!U
be already, late.
"It will *o continue." the doctor placid
ly resumed, "until the race achieves a
different Ideal. Now you will say. but
there can be no ideal so long as there is
no Imagination: and as I have directlyâ a
moment soonâ said, the race la too young

they are shut to us.
This explosion of thÂ«Â» doctor's meant
that he invited and awaited some contra
diction. As none ensued, he went on:
sincere desire to please the paying public.
"Isn't it a huge bear-garden, though?"
asks Launton Oidaker of . the estimable
Dr. von Herzlich. after the two had ob
served the scene in silence for a time.
The wise German dropped an olive Into
his Rhine wine and gazed reflectively
about the room. Men and women sat at
tables drinking. Beyond the tables at tha
farther side of the room other men were
playing billiards. It was 4 o'clock and
the tide was high.
"It !s yet more." answered the doctor.
"In my prolonged studies of natural phe
nomena this Is the most valuable of all
which I have been privileged to observe."
He calWl them "bif.Uetched" and
"awbsalrf" with great nicety. Perhaps
his discernment was less at fault.
"Having." continued the doctor, "grant

AN AFTERNOON STROLL. AND AN

She had feared he might rush his pro

much in earnest. But he had not done so.
and she was glad he could be restrained
and deliberate in that "breedy" sort of
way. It promised well, that he.', could
wait until the morrow.

admitted . that it wasn't going to be so
bad, after all.
It also resulted in Miss Bines seeing no
more of either cavalier that night, since
they abandoned their contest only after
every one but a sleepy butler had retired,
and at a time when it became necessary
for the Englishman to assist the Amer
ican up the stairs, though the latter was
moved to protest, as a matter of cheerful
generality, that he was "aw ri'â entirely
cap'le." At parting he repeatedly urged
Mauburn, with tears in his eyes, to point
out one slnele instance in which he had
ever proved false to a friend.
After dinner there were bridge and mu
sic from the big pipe-organ in the music
room, and billiards and some dancing.
The rival cavaliers of Miss Bines, per
ceiving simultaneously that neither
would have the delicacy to withdraw
from the field, cunningly inveigled each
other Into the billiard-room, where they
watchfully consumed whisky and soda
tegether with the design of making each
other drunk. This resulted in the iwo

But the luncheon hour came and peo

Outside most of the others had scattered

Some were on the Jinks. Some had gone

life with disaffection. Noting that the

he rang for. and a pricking i c >* shower,
which he nerved himself to. he was ready
to Ignore his aching head and get the

The Englishman, he seemed to recall,

He opened the floor of the spacious

him blink; and srated where It flooded
him as a calcium was Mauburn. respknd

Through the marbled corridors and re
frul parlors, down the long perspective of
Persian rugs and onyx pillars, the func
tion raced.
The group at Percival's table broke up.
He had an appointment to meet Colonel
Poindexter the next morning to consum
mate the purchase of some oil stock cer
tain to appreciate fabulously in value. He
had promised to listen further to Mr. Isi
dore Lewis regarding a plan for obtain
ing co'itrol of a certain line of one of
the metal stocks. And he hud signified
his desire to make one of a party the af
fable younger man would guide later in
the evening to a sumptuous temple of
chance, to which, by good luck, he had
gained the entree. The three gentlemen
parted most cordially from him after he
had paid the check.
To Mr. LÂ«wis. when Colonel Poindexter
had also left, the young man with m.
taste for gaming remarked Ingenuously:
'Â¦Say, Izzy. on the level, there's the
readiest money that ever registered at
this Joint You don't have to be Mr. Wil

You can have all you want of that at

"I'm making book that way myself."
reFponiled the cheerful Mr. Lewis; "nf

stock grafters and Dawson City Daves
with frozen feet and mining stock In
their mitts, a man's got to play them
close in to his bosom to win out any
thing. Competition Is killing this place,
my boy." Â»
In the Turkish room Perclval found
Mrs. Akemit. gowned to perfection, glow
lr.g, and wearing a bunch of violets big
ger than her pretty head.
"I've Just sent cards to your mother and
sister," ehe explained, as she made room
for him upon the v divan.
To them came presently Mrs. Drelmer,
well-groomed and aggressively cheerful.
"How de do! Just been down to Wall
street seeing how my other half lives,
and now I'm famished for tea and things.
Ah! here are your mother and our proud
Western beauty!" And she went forward
to greet them.
"It's more thah her other half knows
about her," was Mrs. Akemlt's observa
tion to the violets on her breast.
"Come sit with me here in this corner,
dear," said Mrs. Drelmer to Psyche, while
Mrs. Bines Joined her son and Mrs. Ake
mit. "I've bo much to tell you. And that
poor little Florence Akemit. isn't it too
bad about her. You know one of those
bright French women said it's so incon
venient to be a widow because it's neces
sary to resume the modesty of a young
girl without being able to feign her ig
norance. No wonder Florence has a hard
time of It; but isn't it wretched of me to
gossip? And I wanted to tell you espe
cially about Mr. Mauburn. You know of
course he'll be Lord Casselthorpe when
the present Lord Casselthorpe dice; a
splendid title, really quite one of the best
in all England; and, my deai. he's out

In love are fo inconsiderate of us old wo

does those fascinating miniatures of all
th<^ smart people. Excum me one mo
ment, my dear; I want her to meet your

The fashionable miniature artist was
presently arranging with the dazed Mrs.
Bines for miniatures of herself and
Psyche. Mrs. Drelmer. beholding the pair
with the eatlnfied glance of one who has
performed a kindiy action, resumed her
lete-a-tete with Psyche.
Percival, across the rocm. listened to
Mrs. Akemit's artless disclosure that ehe
found life too complexâ far too hazard
ous, indeed, for a poor little creature in
her unfortunate position, no liable to cruel
misjudgment for thoughtless, harmless
acu?, the result of a young ze'st for life.
She had often thought most seriously of

Mr. Bines. I'm amazed^ that I talk this

poor little me! and my poor little confi
dences! One eo seldom meets a man
nowadays with whom one can venture to
talk about any of the real things!"
A little, later, as Mrs. Drelmer was
leaving, the majestic figure of the Baron
Ronault de Palliac framed Itself in the
handsome doorway. He sauntered lav." aa

purposeful air took the seat, Mrs. Drelmer

And this day was much like many days

He became conscious of â¢ sympathizing

CHAPTER XXI.
THE DIVERSIONS OF A YOUNG
MULTI-MILLIONAIRE.
To be idle and lavish of money. 25 years :
old. with the appetites keen and the need
for action always pressing; then to have
loved a girl with quick, strong. , youthful
ardor, and to have had the Ideal -smirched
by gossip, then shattered before his
amazed eyes â this is a situation in -which
the male animal is apt to behave in
c-quably. In the language of the estimable
Dr. von Herzlich, he will seek those ave
nues of modification In which the least
struggle Is required. In the simpler phras
ing of Uncle Peter Bines, he will "cut
loose."
During the winter that now followed
Perclval Bines behaved according to
either formula, as the reader may prefer.
He early ascertained his limitations with
respect to New York and its people.
"Say. old man," he asked Herbert De
lancey Livingston one night, across the
table at their college club, "are all the
people In New York society impecun
ious?"
Livingston had been with him
at Harvard, and Livingston's fam
ily was . so notoriously not impe
cunious that the question was devoid of
any personal element. Livingston, more
over, had dined just unwisely enough to
be truthful.
"Well, to be candid with you. Bines,"
the young man had replied, in a burst of
alcoholic confidence, "about all that you
are likely to meet are brokeâ else you
wouldn't meet 'em, you know," "he ex
plained, cheerfully. "You know, old chap,
a few of you Western people have got
Into the right set here; there's the Nes
bits, for Instance. On my word the good
wife and mother hasn't the kinks out of
her fingers yet, nor the callouses from
her hands, by Jove! She worked so hard
cooking and washing woolen shirts for
miners before Nesblt made his strike. As
for himâ well caviare, I'm afraid, will al
ways be caviare to Jimmy Nesblt. And
now the' son's married a girl that had
everything but .moneyâ my boy, Nellie
Wemple has fairly got that family of
Nesbits awestricken since she married
Into It, Just by the way she can spend
moneyâ but what was I saying, old
chap? Oh, yes. about getting inâ It takes
time, you know; on my word, I think
they were as much as eight years, and
had to start in abroad, at that. At first.
you know, you can only expect to meet
a crowd that can't afford to be exclusive
any longer."
From which friendly counsel, and from
certain confirming observations of his
own, PercJval had concluded that his lot
in New York was to spend money. This
he began to do with a large Western
carelessness that speedily earned him
fame of a sort. Along upper Broadway,
his advent was a golden Jo>* Tradesmen
learned to love him; florists, Jewelers and
tailors hailed his coming with honest
fervor; waiters told moving tales of his
-tips; cabmen fought for the privilege of
transporting him; and the hangers-on of
rich young men picked pieces of lint as
siduously and solicitously from his coat.
One of his favorite resorts was the
sumptuous gambling-house in Forty
fourth street. The man who slides back
the oanel of the stout oaken door early
learned to welcome him through the slit,
barred by itn grill of wrought Iron. Tl\e
attendant who took his coat and hat, the
waiter who took his order for food, and
the croupier who took his money > were
all gladdened %y his coming; for his
gratuities were as large when he lost as
when he won. Even the reserved propri
etor, accustomed as he was to a wealthy
and careless clientele, treated Perclval
with marked consideration after a night
when the young man persuaded him to
withdraw the limit at roulette and spent
a large sum for testing a system for
breaking the wheel, given to him by a
friend lately returned from Monte Carlo.
"I think, really, the fellow who gave
me that system Is an ass." he said, light
ing a cigarette when the play was done.
"Now I'm going down and demolish
eight dollars' worth of food and drinkâ
you won't be all to the good on that, you
know."
His host decided that a young
man who was hungry after los-
In* a- hundred: thousand dollar* In
five hours'- play was a person to bÂ« not
lightly considered. '
And, though he loved the rhythmic whir
and the- ensuing rattle of the little Ivory
ball at the roulette wheel, he did not dis
dain the quieter faro, playing that digni
fied game-- exclusively with the chocolate
colored chips.' which cost a thousand dol
lars a stack.' Sometimes he won, but not
often enough to disturb his host's be
lief that there Is less' of chance in his
business than In' any other known to the
captains of Industry. ;
There were, too, sociable games of pok
er played' with, Gartner of. the lead trust,
Burman. the intrepid young wheat opera
tor from Chicago, and half a dozen other
well-moneyed spirits; games in which the
limit, to" use the Chlcagoan's phrase, was
"the beautiful . but lofty North Star." At
these games he lost even more regularly
than at those where', with the exception
of a trifling percentage, he was solely at
the mercy of chance/ But he was a joy
ous loser, endearing himself to the other
players; to Garran, whom Burman hab
itually accused of being "closer than a
warm night," as well, as to the open
handed son of the chewing gum magnate,
who had been raised aoroad and who pro
tested nightly that there was an element
of beastly American commercialism In tha
game. When Percival was by some
chance absent from a sitting, the others
calculated the precise sum he probably
would have lost and humorously -.ac
quainted him with the amount by tele
graph next mdrnlngâ It was apt to be nine
hundred and some odd dollarsâ requesting
that he cover by check at his early con
venience.
Yet the diversion. was not all gambling.
There were long sessions at all-night res
taurants where the element of chance in
his favor, inconspicuous elsewhere, was
wholly eliminated; suppers t for hungry
Thespians and thirsty parasites, protract
ed with song and talk untilthe gas flames
grew pale yellow and the cabmen, when
the party- went out into the wan light,
would be. low-voiced, confidential and sug
gestive in their approaches.
Broadway would be weirdly quiet at
such times, save for the occasional fren
zied clatter of a hurrying milk ,wagon.
Even the cars seemed to move with less
sound than by day and the early rising
workers inside, holding dinner palls and.
lunch baskets, were subdued and. silent,
yet strangely observing, as i if .the hour
were one in which the vision was made
clear to appraise the values of life Justly.
To the north, whence the cars bulked si
lently, would be an -awakening sky of
such tender beauty that, the revelers often
paid It the tribute of a 'moment's notice.
"Pure turquoise," one would declare.
"With just a' dash' of orange bitters In
it. another might add. '' *, Â¦ â¢
And then perhaps they burst Into song
under the /spell, blending their voices into
what the professional gentlemen termed
"barber shop harmonies," until a police
man would saunter across the Btreet. pre
tending, however, t"hat he was not aware
of them. â¢
Then terhaps a ride toward the beauti
ful-northern sky would be proposed,
three or four hansom or coupe
loads would begin a journey that wound
up through Central Park toward the
northern' light, but which never attained
a point remoter than some suburban road
house, where sleepy <!ooks and bartenders
would have to be routed out to collab
orate toward breakfast. "
Oftener the party" fell away into strag
gling groups with notions for sleep, chant-
Ing at last, perhaps:
While beer- brines *ladneÂ«Â». don't forstet '
That water only makes you wet!
Percival would walk to the hotel, so
bered and perhaps made a little reflective
by the unwonted quiet. But they were
Pleasant, careless folk, he concluded al
ways. They permitted him to spend his
money, but he was quite sure they would
spend it as freely as he if they had it.
More than one appreciative soubrette, met
under such ""circumstances, was subse
quently enabled to laud the sureness of
his taste in Jewelsâ he cared little for
anything but large diamonds, it trans
pired. It was a feeling tribute paid to his
munificence by one of these in converse
with a sister artist, who had yet to meet
him: ' ' "*>
"Say, Myrtle, on the dead, he spends
money just like a young Jew trying to
be white!"
Under this more or less happy surface
of diversion, however, was an experience
decidedly less felicitous. He knew he
should not, must not. hold Avice Milbrey
in his mind; yet when he tried to put her
out it hurt him.
At first he had plumed himself upon his
lucky escape that night, when he would
have declared his love to her. To have
married a clrl who cared only for his
money; that would have been dire enough.
But to marry a girl like that! He had
been lucky indeed!
Yet. as the weeks went by the shock of
the scene wore off. The scene itself re
mained clear, with the grinning gro
tesquerie of the Jack-o'-lanternsSighting
It and mockinc his simplicity. But the
first sharp physical hurt had healed. He
wan forced to admit that the girl still
had nower to trouble him. At times his
strained nerves would relax to no other
device than the picturing of her as his
own. Exactly In the measure that he
indulged this would his pride smart.
With a budding gift for negation he could
Imagine her caring for nothing but his
money; and there was that other picture,
swift and awful, a pantomime in shadow,
with the leering ye..ow faves above it.
In the far nisrht. when he awoke to
sudden and hungry aloneness, he would
let bis arms feel their hunger for her.
The vision of her would be flowers and
music and sunlight and time and. all
things perfect to mystify and delight, to
satisfy ereatest . of all boonsâ to
unsatlsfy. T^e thought of her be
came a rest-house, for, all weariness; a
haven where he was free to choose his
nook and lie down away from all that
was not her.. which was all that was not
beautiful. He would go bark to seek the
lost sweetness of their. first rneâ¬tlng; to
mount "the poor dead belief that she
would care for himâ that he. could make
her care for himâ and endow the thing
with artificial life, trying to capture the
faint breath of It; but. the memory was
always fleeting, attenuated, like the spirit
of the memory of -a perfume that had
been elusive at best. And always, to ban
ish what Joy even this poor device m'ght
bring, came the more vivid vision of the
brutal, sordid facts. He forced hims'.-lf
to face them regularly as a penance and
a corrective.
They came before him with especial
clearness when he met her from time to
time during the winter.' He watched her
in talk with Others, noting the contradic
tion in her that she would at one moment
appear knowing, and masterful^ with
depths of reserve that the other people
neither fathomed nor knew of; and at
another moment frank**- girlish, with an
appealing feminine helplessness which is
woman's' greatest" strength, coercing
every strong masculine Instinct. - r '-'>\
"Wherr the reserve showed In "- her, he
became afraid.- What -was she not capa
ble of? In the other mood, frankly ap
pealing, she drew' him mightily, bo that
he Â° abandoned' himself : for tho moment,
responding to her fresh exultinjt youth,
longing to take her,' to' give her things,
to make her laugh, to enfold and protect
her, to tell her secrets. â¢ to : father her
cheek with the . softest kiss, to be the
child-mate of her. â¢
Toward him, directly, when they met
she would sometimes be glacial and for
bidding, sometimes unlnterestedly frank,
as if they were but the best of common
place friends. Yet sometimes she made
him feel that she, too. threw herself
heartily to reat In the thought of their
loving, and cheated herself, as he j did,
with dreams of comradeship. She left
him at these times withVthe feeling that
they were deaf, dumb and blind to each
Other; that If some means of communi
cation could be devised, something surer
than the invisible play of secret longings,
all might yet be well. They talked as
the people about them talked, words that
meant nothing to either, and if there
were mute questionings, naked appeals,
unuttered declarations, they were only
such as, language serves to diyeit atten
tion from. Speech, doubtless, has its uses
as well as its abuses. Politics, for exam
ple, would be less entertaining without it.
But in matters of the heart, ctrtaln.it
is that there would be fewer misunder
standings if it were forbidden between
the couple under the penalty of immedi
ate separation. In this affair real mean-
Ings are rarely conveyed except by
silences. Words are not more than taste
less-drapery to obscure their lines. The
silence of lovers is the. plainest of all
speech, warning, disconcerting Indeed, by
its very bluntness, any b^ut the truly
mated. An hour's silence with these two
people by themselves might have worked
wonders.
Another diversion of Percival's during
this somewhat feverish winter was Mrs.
Akemlt. Not only was she a woman, of
finished Â«and expert daintiness in dress
and manner and surroundings, but she
soothed, flattered, and stimulated him.
With the wisdom of her thirty-two years,
devoted chiefly to a study of his species,
she took care never to be exigent. She
had the way of- referring to herself as
"poor little me," yet she never made de
mands or allowed him to feel that she ex
pected anything from ,hlm in the way of
allegiance. *â¢
Mrs." Akemit was not only like St. Paul,
"all things to all men," but she had gone
a Btep bey Ad that excellent theologue.
She could be* all things to one man. She
was light-hevttdly frivolous, soberly re
flective, â¢ shallow, cynical or
naive. Ingenuous or Inscrutable. She
prized dearly, the ecclesiastical back
ground provided by her uncle, the bishop,
and had him to dine wlth_the same un
erring sense of artistry that led her to
select swiftly the becoming shade of sofa
cushion to put her blond head back upon.
The good bishop believed she had jeop
ardized her soul with divorce. He feared
now she meant to lose It irrevocably
through remarriage. As a foil to his aus
terity, therefore, she would be audacious
ly gay In his presence.
"Hell," she said to him one evening. "Is
given up so reluctantly by those who
don't expect to go there." And while the
bishop frowned Into his salad she Invited
Percival to drink with her in the manner
of a woman who is. mad to Invite perdi
tion. If the good man could have beheld
her before a background of frivolity ho
might have suffered less anxiety. For
there her sense of contrast-values led
her to be grave and deep, to express dis
taste for society with its hollowness, and
to expose timidly the cruel scars on a
soul meant for higher things.
Many afternoons Percival drank tea
with her' In the little red drawing-room
of her dainty apartment up the avenue.
Heic in the half light, which she had pre
ferred since thirty. In a soft corner with
which she harmonized faultlessly, and
where the blaze from the open fire col
ored her animated face Just enough, she
talked him usually into the glow of a.
high conceit with himself. When Â»he
dwelt upon the shortcomings of man, she
did it with the air of frankly presuming
him to be different from all others, one
who could sympathize with her through
knowing the frailties of his sex, yet one
mmeasurably superior to them. When he
was led to talk of himselfâ of whom, it
seemed, she could never learn enough
he at once came to take high views of
himself; to gaze, .through her tactful
prompting, with gentle, purring apprecia
tion upon tho manifest spectacle of his
own worth.
Sometimes, away from her, he wondered
how she did it. Sometimes, in her very
presence, his sense of humor became alert
and suspicious. Part of the time he de
cided her to be a charming woman, with a
depth and quality of sweetness unguessed
by the world. The rest of the time he re
membered a saying about alfalfa made by
Uncle Peter: "It's an Innocent lookln',
triflin' vegetable, but Its roots go right
down Into the ground a hundred feet.".
"My dear," Mrs. Akemit had once con
fided to an Intimate in an nour of negli
gee, "to meet a man, any man, from a
red-cheeked butcher boy to a bloodless
monk. and. not make him feel something
new for youâ something he never before
felt for any other womanâ really it's as
criminal as a wrinkled stocking or for
blondes to wear shiny things. Every
woman can do It If she'll study a little
how to reduce them to their least com
mon denominatorâ how to make them
primitive."
Of another member of Mrs. Akemlt's
household Perclval acknowledged the
sway with never a misgiving. He haJ
been the ilevoted lover of Baby Akemlt
from the afternoon when he had first
cajoled her into autobiography-ra vivid,
fire-tipped little thing with her motlier'.-*
piquancy. He gleaned that 'lay trmt she
was "a quarter to four years old": that
she was mamma's girl, but papa wsia a
fri<nd of Santa Claus; that she wont to
"ball dancts' 1 every day clad In "dest a
stlrt 'cause, big ladies don't ever wear
waist-es at night": that she had once rid
den in a merry-go-round and it made her
"all homesick right here." patting her
stomach: and that "elephants are horrid,
but you mustn't be cruel to them and
cut their eyes out. Oh. no!" â¢ ,
Her Perclval courted with results that
left nothing tj> be desired. She fell to the
floor In helpless, shrieking laughter when
he came. In his honor she composed and
sang songs to an- Improvised and spirited
accompaniment upon her toy piano. His
favorites among the?e were "'Cause Why
I Love You" and "Darling. 'Aak Myself
to Come to You." She rendered them
with much feeling. If he were present
when her bedtime came she refused to
sleep until he had consented .to an in
terview.
Avice Milbrey had the fortune to wit
ness one of these bedtime causerles. One
late afternoon the young man's summons
came while he was one of a group that
lingered late about Mrs." Akemit' s little
tea table, Miss Milbrey being of the
number. â¢ *
He followed the , maid dutifully q,ut
through the hall to thÂ« door of the bed
room and entered on all fours wlth r what
they two had agreed was the growl of a
famished bear.
The familiar performance was viewed
by the mother and by Miss Milbrey,
whom the' mother had urged to follow.
Baby Akemlt in her crib, modestly ar
rayed In blue pajamas, after simulating
the extreme terror required by the situa
tion, fell to chatting, while her mother
and - Miss Milbrey * looked on f rota 'tho
doorway.
Miss Akemit had once been out In the
woods. It appeared, and a "bltlngr wolf
chased her, and she ran and ran until she
came to a river all full of pigs and fishes
and berries, so she jumped In and had
supper, and It wasn't a "biting wolf" at
all â and then â ~
But the narrative was cut short by her
mother.
"Come, pet! Mr. Bines wishes to go
now."
Miss Akemlt, It appeared, was bent,
upon relating the adventures of Goldle
Locks, subsequent to her leap from the
window of the bear's house. She had, it
seemed, been compelled . to ride nine
twenty miles on a trolley, and. reaching
home too late for . lunch â¢Â»pn, had been
obliged to eat In the kitchen with the
"Mr. Bines can't stay, dail'ng!"
Baby Akemit calculated briefly, and
consented to his departu^ if" Mr. Bines
would bring her something next time.
Mr. . Bines promised, and moved away
after the customary embrace, but she was
not through:
"Oh! oh! go out like a bear! dere's a
bear come in here!"
And so, having brought the bear In, he
was forced to drop again and growl the
beast out, whereupon, appeased by this
strict observance of the unities, the child
sat up and demanded:
"You sure you'll'bring me somefin next
time?"
"Yes. sure, Lady Grenvllle St. Clare."
"Well, you sure you're comin' next
time?"
Being reassured on this point, and satis
fled that no more bears were at large, she
lay down once more while Perclval and
the two observers returned to the draw
ing-room.
"You love children so!'Â«- Miss Milbrey
said. And never had she been so girlish
ly appealing to all that was Btrong In him
as a man. The frolic with the child
seemed to have blown away a fog from
between them. Yet never had the other
scene been more vivid to him, and never
had the pain of her heartlessness been
more poignant.
When he "played" with Baby Akemlt
thereafter, the pretense was not all with
the child. For while she might "play" at
giving a vexatiously large dinner, for
which- she was obliged to do the-cooklng
because she had discharged all the ser
vants, or when they "played" that the'
big coJih was a splendid ferry-boat fin
which they were sailing to Chicago where
Uncle David livedâ with many stern
threats "to ,4ell the Janitor of the boat if
the captain didn't behave himself and sail
fasterâ Percival "played" that his com
panion's name was Baby Bines, and that
her mother, who watched them with lov
ing eyes, was a sweet and gracious young
woman named Avice. And when he told
Baby Akemit that she was "the only orig
inal sweetheart" he meant It of some one
else than her.
When the play was over he always con
ducted himself back to the sane reality
by viewing this some one else in the cold
light of truth.
v CHAPTER XXII.
THE DISTRESSING ADVENTURE OF
MRS. BINES.
The fame of the Bines family for de
spising money was not fed wholly by Per
cival's unremitting activities. Miss Psyche
Bines during the winter achieved wide
and enviable renown as a player of bridge
whist.* "Not for the excellence of. her play;
rather for tho Inveteracy and size of her
lossts and the unconcerned cheerfulness
with which she defrayed them. She paid
the considerable sums with an air of
gratitude for having been permitted to
lose them. â¢ Especially did she seem grate
ful for the zealous tutelage and chaper
onage of Mrs. Drelmer.
"Everybody li> Xew York plays bridge,
my dear, and of course you must
learn." that capable lady had said in the
beginning.
"But 1 never was bright at cards," the
girl confessed, "and I'm afraid I couldn't
learn bridge well enough to interest you
good players."
"Nonsense!" was Mrs. Drelmer's assur
ance, "Bridge is easy' to learn and easy
to play. I'll teach you. and I promise you
the people you play with shall never com
plain."
Mrs. Drelmer, it soon appeared, knew
what she was talking about.
Indeed, that well-informed woman was
always liktly to. Her husband was an In.
tellecrual delinquent whom she spoke of
largely as being Jin Wall street," and in
that feat of jugglery known as "keeping
up appearances" his wife had long been
the more dexterous performer.
She was apt not only to know what she
talked about, but she was a woman of
resource, unafraid of action. She drilled
Miss Bines in the rudiments of bridge. If
the teacher became subsequently much
the largest winner of the pupil's losings,
it was perhaps not more than hÂ»r lit
recompense. For Miss Bines enjoyed not
only the sport of the game, but her man
ner of playing it. combined with the so
cial prestige of her amKble sponsor, pro
cured her a circle or" acquaintances that
would otherwise hnve remained consid
erably narrower. An enthusiastic player
of bridge, of passable exterior, mediocre
skill Â«md unlimited resources ne^d never
want in New York for very excellent so
rirty. Not only was the Western girl re?"
oelved by Mr*. Drelmer's Immediate cir
ri*, but more than one member of whst
the lady rullQ.1 "that snubhv set" would
row and thrn make a place for her at the
end table. A few of Mrs. Drelmer's In
timates were so 'wanting In good taste as
to Intimate th^t she exploited Miss Bines
even to the degree of an understanding
expressed In bnld percentage, with cer
tain of those to whom she secured the
girl's at cards. Whether this
ill-natured gossip was true or false. It i.s
certain that the exigencies of life on next
to nothing a year.' with a husband who
could bonst of next to nothing but Fam
ily^ had developed an unerring business
senre in Mrs. Drelmer; and certain it also
Is that this winter was one when the ap
pearances with which she had to strive
were unwonted'y buoyant.
Miss BJnrs tirelessly memorized rules.
She would disclose,' to her_ placid mother
that the lead of a trump to the third
hand's go-over of- hearts is of doubtful
expediency: or that one must "follow suit
with tho smallest, except when you have
only two. neMher of. them better than the
Jack. Then play the higher first, so that
when the lower faHs your partner may
know you are out of the suit, and ruff
it."
Mrs. Bines declared that It did Sepm to
her very much like out-and-out gambling
But Perclval. looking over the stubs of
his sister's checkbook, warmly protested
her Innocence of this charge.
"Heaven knows sis has her shortcom
ings," he observed, patronizingly, in- that
young woman's presence, "but she's no
gambler; don't say it, ma, I beg of you!
She only knows l.ve rules of the game,
and I Judge it's cost her about three thou
sand dollars each to learn those. â¢ And
the only one she never forgets Is, "When
in doubt, lead your highest check/ ' But
don't ever accuse her of gambling. Poor
glrl t if she keeps on playing bridge she'll
hav'e writer's cramp; that's all I'm afraid
of. I see there's a new rapid-fire cneck
book on the market, and an Improved
fountain pen that doesn't slobber- * I'll
have to get her one of each." '. â¢ Â¦ â¢â¢
Yet Psyche Bines' experience, like her
brother's, was not without a proper-leav
en of sentiment. . There was Fred.. Mll
brey, handsome, clever, amusing, know-
Ing every one. and giving her a pleasant
sense of Intimacy with all that was worth
while in Now York. Him she- felt .â¢very
friendly to. :Â£<Â»."
Then there was Mauburn. presently . to
be Lord Casselthorpe. with his lazy, high
pitched drawl; good-naiured, frank.; car
rying an atmosphere of high-class British,
worldllness, and delicately awakening
within her while she was with hirer a
sense of her own latent superiority to the
Institutions of her native land. She liked
Mauburn, too. * * . j Â¦;
.More impressive than either of these,
however, was the Baron Konault de Pal
llac. Tall, swarthy, saturnine, a polished
man of all the world, of manners finished,^
elaborate arid ceremonious, she found'
herself feeling foreign and distlnguisfted
In his presence, quite as if she were the
heroine of a romantic novel, and might' at
any instant be called upon to assist in
royalist Intrigues. The Baron, to her io
tuition. nursed secret sorrows. For tbese
she secretly worshiped him. It Is ' true
that when he dined with her and her
mother, which he was frequently gracious
enough to do. he ate with a hearttaess^
that belled this secret sorrow ,she
had imagined. But **e was fasci
nating at all times, with a grace
at table not less finished than that
with which he bowed at their meetings
and partings. It was not unpleasant to
think of basking dally in the shine of
that grand manner, even If she did feel
friendlier with Milbrey, and more at ease
with Mauburn.
If the truth must be told. Miss Bines
was less impressionable than either of
the three would have wished. Her heart
seemed not easy to reach; her impulses
were not- Inflammable. Young Mllbr.ey
early confided to his family a suspicion
that she was singularly hard hearted and
the definite information that she had "a
hob-nailed Western way" of treating' her
admirers.
Mauburn, too, was shrewd enough to
see that, while she frankly liked him. he
was for some reason less a favorite than
the Baron de Palliac
"It'll be no easy matter marrying that
girl." he told Mrs. Drelmer. "She's really
a dear, and awfully good fun. but she's
not a bit silly and I dare say she'll marry
some chap because she likes him and not
because he's anybody, you know."
"Make her like you," insisted h's ad
vlsjer. 'â¢â¢_*...
"On my word. I wish she did. And I'm
not so sure, you know, she doesn't fancy j
that Frenchman, or even young Milbrey." j
"I'll keep you before her." promised >
Mrs. Drelmer,. "and I wish you'd not
think you can't win her. 'Tisn't like. you."
Miss Bines accordingly heard that :lt
was such a pity young Milbrey drank "so,
because his only salvation lay In making
a rich marriage, and a young man now
adays, had to keep fairly sober to accom
plish that. Really, Mrs. Drelmer felt sor
ry for the poor, weak fellow. "Good
hearted chap, but he has no character,
my dear, so I'm afraid there's no hope
fcr him. He ha3 the soul of a merchant
tailor, actually, but not a tailor's man
hood. Otherwise he'd be above marrying
some unsuspecting girl for her money and
breaking her heart after marriage. Now,
Mauburn is a type so different; honest,
unaffected, healthy, really he's a man for
any girl to be proud of. even if he were
not heir to a titleâ one of the best in all
England and an ornament of the most
exclusively correct set; of a line, my dear,
that is truly greatâ not like that shoddy
French nobility, discredited In France,
that sends so many of its comic opera
barons here looking for large dowries to
pay their gambling debts and put fur
niture in their rattletrap old chateaux
and keep them in absinthe and their other
peculiar diversions. And Mauburn, you
lucky minx, simply adores youâ he's quite
mad about you. really!"
In spite of Mrs. Drelmer's two edged
sword Miss Bines continued rather more
favorable to the line of De Palliac. The
Baron was so splendid, so gloomy, so def
erential. He had the air of laying at her
feet, as a rug, the whole glorious history
of France. And he appeared so welj la
tfie victoria when tney drove in the park,
"it Is true that the heart of Miss Bines
was -as yet quite untouched; and it was
not more than a cool. dim. esthetic light
in which she surveyed the three
suitors impartially, to behold the impres
sive figure of the Baron towering above
the others. Had the Baron proposed for
her hand. It is not Impossible that, fac
ing the question directly, she would have
parried or evaded.
But certain events befell unpropitiously
at a tJme when the Baron was most cer
tain of his conquest; at the very time,
Indeed, when he had determined to open
his suit definitely by extending a proposal
to the younK lady through the orthodox
medium of her nearest male relative.
"I admit," wrote the Baron to his ex
pectant father, "that it Is what one calls
'very chances' in the English, but one
must venture In this country, and your
son Is not without hope. And if not. there
Is still Mile. Higbee."
The Earon shuddered as he wrote It.
He preferred not to recognize even tha
existence of this alternative, for the rea
son that the father of Mile. Higbee dis
tressed him by an incompleteness of
buavity."
"He conducts himself like a pork," the
Baron would declare to himself, by way
of perfecting his Englisb.
The secret cause of his subsequent de
termination not to propose for the hand
uf Miss Bines lay in the hopelessly mid
dle class leanings of the lady who might
have incurred the supreme honor of be
coming his mother-in-law. Had Mrs. Bines
been above talking to low people, a catas
trophe might have been averted. But
Mrs. Bines was not above It. She was
quite unable to repress a vulgar Interest
in the menials that served her.
She knew the butler's life history two
days after she had ceased to be afraid of
him. She knew the distressing family af
fairs of the maids: how many were the
Ignoble progeny of the elevator man. and
what his plebeian wife did for their croup;
how much rent the hallboy's low-born
father paid for his mean two-story dwell
ing in Jersey City; and how many hours
a day or night the debased scrub-women
devoted to their unrefinlns toll.
Brazenly, too. she held converse with
Philippe, the active and voluble Alsatian
who served her when ahe chose to uiuo .aTHE SUNDAY CALL.
the public restaurant Instead of at her i
own private table. Philippe acquainted 1
h*-r with the Joys and griefs of his diffl- 1
cult profession. There were fourteen 1
thuuEand waiters in New York, if. by
waiters, you meant any one. Of course '
there were not bo many like Philippe,
nun of the world who had served their i
time as assistants and their three years <
us sub-waiters; men who epoke English. 'Â¦
French and German, who knew some
thing of cooking, how to dress a salad, I
and how to carve. Only such, it appeared, '
could be members of the exclusive Gene
va Club that procured a place for you â¢
*hen you were idle, and paid you eight '
do:iars a week when you were slcK.
Having the qualifications, ore could earn â¢
twenty-five dollars a month in salary and
three or four times as much in gratuities. *
Philippe's income was never less than one â¢
hundred and twenty dollars a month;
for was he not one who had come from Â¦
Europe as a master, after two seasons '
at Paris where a man acquires his polish
âhis perfection of manner, his finish, his
pmce? Philippe could never enough
prize that post-graduate course at the
Maifon d'Or, where he had personally :
knownâ madame might not believe it â
the incomparable Casmir, a chef who
served two generations of epicures,
primes, kings, statesmen, travelling
Americansâ all the truly great.
With his own lips Casmir had told him,
Philippe, of the occasion when Dumas,
pere. had lnx-lted him to dinner that they
might discuss the esoterics of salad
dressing and sauces: also of the time
when the Marquis de St. Georses em
braced Casmir for inventing the precious
roup that afterward became famous as
Potape Germlne. And now the skilled
and puissant Casmir had retired. It was
a. calamity. The Maison d'OrâParis
would no longer be what they had been.
For that matter, since one must live
Philippe preferred it to be in America,
for in no other country could an adept
acquire so much money. And Philippe
knew the whole dining world. With Ce
line and the baby. Paul. Philippe dwelt
In an apartment that would really amaze
rnadaroe by Its appointments of luxury,
la East Thirty-eighth street, and only the
four flighte to climb. And Paul was three,
the largest of his age, quite the largest,
that either Philippe or Celine had ever be
held. Even the brother of Celine and his
wife, who had a restaurant of their own
serving the table d'hote at two and one
half francs the plate, with Â» wineâ even
these swore they had never seen an in
fant so big, for his years, as Paul.
And so Mrs. Bines grew actually to feel
an interest in the creature and his
wretched affairs, and even fell into the
deplorable habit of saying. "I must come
to see you and your wife and Paul some
pleasant day. Philippe." and Philippe, be
ing a man of the world, thought none the
less of her for believing that she- did not
mean it.
Yet it befell on an afternoon that Mrs.
Bines found herself in a populous side
street, driving home from a visit to the
rheumatic scrub-woman who had now to
be supported by the paprrs her misera
ble offspring sold. Mrs. Bines had never
seen so many' children as flooded this
street. She wondered if an orphan asyl
um were In the neighborhood. And
though the day was pleasantly warm,
she decided that there were alÂ«out her
at least a thousand cases of inclpent
pneumonia, for not one child m five had
on a hat. They raged and dashed and
rippled from curb to curb so that they
might have made her think of a ewift
mountain torrent at the bottom of a
gloomy canyon, but that the worthy wo
man was too literal-minded for such
fancies. She only warned the man to
drive slowly.
And then by a street sign she saw that
she was near the home of Philippe. It
was three o'clock and he would be resting
from his work. The man found the num
ber. The waves parted and piifcd them
selves on either side in hushed wonder as
she entered the hallway and searched for
the name on the little cards under the
bells. Khe had never known the surname,
and on the two. cards "Ph." appeared.
She rang one of the bells, the door mys
teriously opened with a repeated double
click, and she began the toilsome climb.
The waves of children fell together be
hind her In turbulent play again.
At the top she breathed a moment and
then knocked at a door before her. A
voice within called:
"Entrezl" and Mrs. Bines opened the
dcor.
It was the tiny kitchen of Philippe.
Philippe himself, in shirt sleeves, sat in a
chair tilted back close to the gas range,
the Courier des Etats Unis in his hands
and Paul on his lap. Celine ironed the
bosom of a gentleman's white shirt on an
ironing board supported by the backs of
two chairs.
Hemmed in the corner by this board
and by the gas range, seated at a table
covered by the oilcloth that simulates the
marble of Italy's most famous quarry,
sat. undoubtedly, the Baron Ronault Tie
Palliac A steaming plate of spaghetti a
la Italien was before him, to his left a
large bowl of salad, to his right a bottle
of red wine.
For a space of three seconds the entire
party behaved aa if it were being photo
graphed under time exposure. Philippe
and the baby etared, motionless. Celine
stared, resting no slight weight on the
hot flatlron. The Baron Ronault de Pal
liac eUred. his fork poised in midair and
festooned with gay little streamers of
spaghetti.
Then came smoke, the smell of scorch
ing linen and a cry of horror from Celine.
"Ah. la seule chemise blanche de Mon
sieur le Baron!"
The epell was broken. Philippe was on
his feet, bowing effusively.
"Ah! it is Madam Bines. Je suis tres
honoreâ I am very honored to welcome
you, madame. It is madame. ma femme,
Celineâ andâ Monsieur le Baron de Pal
liac "
Philippe had turned with evident dis
tress toward the latter. But Philippe was
only a waiter and had not behind him
the centuries of schooling that enable a
gentleman to remain a gentleman under
adverse conditions.
The Baron Ronault de Palliac arose
with unruffled aplomb and favored the
caller with his stateliest bow. He was at
the moment a graceful and silencing re
buke to those who aver that manner and
attire be Interdependent. The Baron's
manner was ideal, undlrcinished in vol
ume, faultless as to decorative qualities.
One fitted to savor its exquisite finish
would scarce have noted that above his
waist the noble gentleman was clad in a
single woolen undergarment of revolu
tionary red.
Or if such a one had observed this
trifling circumstance he would assuredly
have treated it as of no value to the mo
ment; something to note, perhaps, and
then gracefully to forget.
The baron's own behavior would have
served ss a model. One swift glance
had ehown him there was no way
of Instant retreat. That being impossible,
none other was graceful; hence none
other was to be considered. He permitted
himself not to even glance at the shirt
upon whose fair defenseless bosom the
iron of the overcome Ceiine had burned
its cruel brown imprlmature. Mrs. Bines
had greeted him as he would have wished
unconscious, apparently, that there could
be cause for embarrassment.
"Ah! madame." he said, handsomely. .
"you see me, I unfast with the fork.
You see me here, I have envy of the |
simple life. I am content of to do itâ
comme caâ as that, see you." waving In
the direction of his unfinished repast.
"All that magnificence of your grand ho
tel, there Is not the why of It, the most
bis of the world, and suchly stupefying,
with its 'infernil rackit.' as you say. And
of moreâ what droll oftidea, enough cu
rious, by example! to dT*ell with the & ood
Philippe and his femmeX amiable. Their
hotel is of the most littles, but I rest here
volunteerly since longtime. Is it that one
can to comprehend living the vast hotel
American?"
"Monsieur le Baron lodges with us; we
have so much of the chambers," ventured
Celine.
"Monsieur le Baron wishes to retire to
his apartment." said Philippe, raising the
ironing-board. "Will madame be so good
to enter our petit salon at the frcnt,
n est-ce-pas?"
The baron stepped forth from his cor
ner and bowed himself graciously out.
"Madame, my complimentsâ and to the
adorable Mile. Bines! Au revoir, rnad
ame-to the soontlmeâ avant peuâ before
little!"
On the farther side of his closed door
the Baron Ronault de Palliac sworeâ
once. .But the oath was. one of the most
awful that a Frenchman may utter in his
native tongue: "Sacred Name of a
Name!"
"But the baron wasn't done eating,"
protested Mrs. Bines.
"Ah. yes, madame!" replied Philippe.
"Monsieur le Baron has consumed enough
for now. ' Paul, man enfant, ne touche
pas la robe de madame! He is largo, is
he not, madame, as 1 have told you? A
monster, yes?"
Mrs. Bines, stooping, took the limp
and wide-eyed Paul up In her arms.
Whereupon he began to talk so fast to
her in French that she .set him quickly
down again, with the slightly helpless air
of one who has picked up an Innocent
looking cloclf only to have the clang.ng
alarm go suddenly off.
"Madame will honor our little salon."
urged Philippe, opening the door and
bowing low.
"Quel dommage!" sighed Celine, mov
ing after them; "la seule chemise blanche
de Monsieur le Baron. Eh blen! 11 faut
lul en acheter une autre!"
At dinner that evening Mrs. Bines re
lated her adventure, to the unfeigned de
light of her graceless son, and to the
somewhat troubled amazement of her
daughter.
"And, do you know," she ventured,
"maybe he Isn't a regular baron, after
ill!" <*
"Oh, I guess he's a regular one all
right." said Percival; "only perhaps he
hasn't worked at it much lately."
"But his sitting there eating in thatâ
that shirtâ" said his sister.
"My dear young woman, even the no
bility are prey to climatic rigors; they
are obliged, like the wretched low-born
such as ourselves, to wearâ pardon me â
undergarments. Again, I understand from
Mrs. Cadwallader here that the article in
question was satisfactory and fitâ red, I
believe you say, Mrs. Terwilliger?"
"Awful red!" replied his motherâ "and
they call their parlor a saloon."
"And of necessity, even the noble have
their moments of deshabille."
"They needn't eat their lunch that
way," declared his sister.
"Is deshabille French for under
clothes?" asked Mrs. Bines, struck by the
word.
"Partly," answered her son.
"And the way that child of Philippe's
jabbered French! It's wonderful how
they can learn sÂ« young."
"They begin early, you know," Percival
explained. "And as to our friend the
Baron, I'm ready to make book that sis
doesn't see him again, except at a dis
tance."
Some time afterwards he computed the
round sum he might have won If any
such bets had been made; for hi? sister's
list of suitors, to adopt his own lucent
phrase, was thereafter "shy a Baron."
CHAPTER XXIII.
THE SUMMER CAMPAIGN IS
PLANNED.
Winter waned and spring charmed the
land into blossom. The city-pent, as we
have intimated, must take this season
largely on faith. If one can find a* patch
of ground naked of stone or asphalt one
may feel the heart of the earth beat. But
even now the shop-windows are more in
spiring. At least they copy the outer
show. Tender-hued shirt-waists first
push up their sprouts of arms through
the winter furs and woolens, quite as the
first violets out in the woodland and
thrust themselves up through the brown
carpet of leaves. Then every window be
comes a summery glade of lawn, tulle,
and chiffon, more lavish of tints, shades
and combinations, Indeed, than ever na
ture dared to be.
Outside, where the unspoiled earth be
gins, the blossoms are clouding the trees
with a mist of pink and white, and the
city-dweller knows it from the bloom and
foliage of these same windows.
Then it is that spring "get away" urge
is felt by each prisoner, by those able
to obey It. and by those, alike, who must
wear It down In the groomed and sophis
ticated wildness of the city parks.
On a morning late in May Mrs. Bines
and her daughter were at breakfast.
"Isn't Percival coming?" asked his
mother. "Everything will be cold."
"Can't say," Psyche answered. "I don't
even know If he came In last night. But
don't worry about cold things. You can't
get them too cold for Perce at breakfast,
nowadays. He takes a lot of icewater
and a little something out of the decanter
and mavbe some black coffee."
"Yes, and # I'm sure it's bad for him.
He doesn't look a bit healthy and hasn't
since he quit eating breakfast. He used
to be such a hearty eater* at breakfast,
steaks and bacon and chops and eggs and
â¢waffles. It was a sight to see him eat;
and since he's quit taking anything but
that cdld etuff he's lost his color and his
eyes don't look right. I know what he's
got hold ofâ it's that 'no-breakfast* fad.
I heard about It from Mrs. Balldridge
when we came here last fall. I never did
believe in it, either."
The object of her solicitude 'entered in
dressing gown and slippers.
"I'm Just telling Psyche that this no
breakfast fad is hurting your health, my
son. Now do come and eat like you used
to. You began to look bad as soon as
you left off your breakfast. It's a silly
fad. that's what it is. You can't tell me!"
The young man stared at his mother
until he had mastered her meaning. Then
he put both hands to his head and turned
to the sideboard as if to conceal his emo
tion.
"That's it." he said, as he busied him
self with a tall giass and the cracked ice.
"It's that 'no-breakfast' fad. J. didn't
think you knew about it. The fact la,"
he continued, pouring out a measure of
brandy and directing; the butler to open
a bottle of soda, "we all eat too much.
After a night of sound sleep we awaken
refreshed and buoyant, all our forces re
plenished; thirsty, of course, but not hun
gry"âhe Â»at down to the table and placed
both hands again to his headâ "and we
have no need ot food. Yet such is the
force of custom that we deaden ourselves
for the day by tanking v up on coarse,
loathsome stuff like bacon. Ugh! Any
one would think, the way you two eat '
so early In the day, that you were a
couple of cave-dwellersâ the kind that al
ways loaded up when they had a chance
because it might be a week before they
got another."
He drained his glass and brightened vis
ibly.
"Now, why not be reasonable?" he con
tinued, pleadingly. "You know there is
plenty of food. I have observed it being
brought into town in huge wagon loads
in the early morning on many occasions.
Why do you want to oat it all at one
sitting? No one's going to starve you.
"Why stupefy yourselves when, by a little
nervy self-denial, you can remain as
fresh and bright and clear-headed as I
am at this moment? Why doesn't a fire
make its own escape, Mrs. Carstep-Jam
wuddle?"
"I don't believe you feel right, either.
I just know you've got an awful headache
right now. Do let the man give you a
nice piece of this steak."
"Don't, I beg of you, Lady Ashmorton!
The suggestion is extremely repugnant to
me Besides, I'm behaving this way be
cause I arose with the purely humorous
fancy that my head was a fine large ac
cordion and that some meddler had drawn
it out too far. I'm sportively pretending
that I can press it back into shape. Now
you and sis never get up with any 'such
light poetic notion ag that. You know
you don'tâ don't attempt to deceive me."
He glanced over the table with swift dis
approval.
"Strawberries, oatmeal, rolls, steak three
inches thick, bacon, omeletteâ oh. that I
should live to see this day! It's disgrace
ful! And at your ageâ before your own
innocent woman-child a,nd leading her into
the same excesses. Do you know what
that breakfast is? No; I'll tell you. That
breakfast Is No. 73 In that book of Mrs-
Rorer's, and she 'expressly warns every
body that it can be eaten safely only by
steeple climbers and piano movers and
sea captains. Really, Mrs. Wrangleberry,
I blush for you. V
"I don't care how you go on. You ain't
looked well for months." â¢
"But think of, my great big heartâ a
heart like an ox"â he seemed on the verge
of tearsâ "and to think that you, a woman
I have never treated with anything but
respect since we met in Honduras In the
fall of '93â to think you should throw It
up to my own face that I'm not beautiful.
Others there are, thank God, who can
look into a manld heart and prize him
for what he isâ not condemn him for his
mere superficial blemishes."
"And I Just know you've got in with a
fast set. I met Mr. Milbrey yesterday In
the corridor "
"Did he tell you to make a lovely as
paragus shortcake or something?"
"He told me tnose men you go with so
much are dreadful gamblers and that
when you all went to Palm Beach last
February you played poker night and day,
and you told me you went for your
health."
"Oh, he did, did he? Well, I didn't get
anything else. He's a dear oldisoul, if
you've got the copper hand// It that man j
was a woman he'd be a warm neighbor
hood gossip. He'd be the nice, kind old
lady that starts things, that's what Hod
dy Milbrey would be."
"And you said yourself you played pok
er most of the time when you went to
Aikcn on the car last month." t
"To be honest with you, ma, we did play
poker. Say, they took it off of me so fast
I could feel myself catching cold."
"There, you seeâ and you really ought
to wear one of those chamois skin chest
protectors In this damp climate."
"Well, we'll see. If I can find one that
an ace full won't go through I'll snatch it
,so quick the man'll think he's being rob
bed. Now 'I'll Join you ladles to the ex
tent of some coffee, and then I want to
know what you two would rather do this
summer than."
"Of course," said Psyche, "no one stays
in town in summer."
"Exactly. And I've chartered a steam
yacht as big as this hotelâ all but
But what I want to know/ is whether you
two care to bunk on it or whether you'd
rather stay quietly at some place, New
port, perhaps, and maybe take a cruise
with me now and then."
"Oh, that would be good fun. But here's
ma getting so I can't do a thing with her,
on account of all those beggars and nor
rld people down In the slums,"
Mrs. Bines looked guilty and feebly dep
recating. It was quite true that in her
own way she had achieved a reputation
for prodigality not inferior to that ac
quired by her children in ways of their
own."
"You know it's so, ma," the daughter
went on, accusingly. "One night last win
ter when you were away we dined at the
Balldrldge, in Eighty-sixth, street, and
the pavements were so sleety the horses
couldn't stand, so Colonel Balldridge
brought us home in the elevated about 11
o'clock. Well, at one of the stations a
big policeman, got on with a little baby
all wrapped up in red flannel. He'd found
It In an area way, nearly covered with
snowâ where some one had left it, and he
was taking it down to police headquar
ters, he said. Well, ma went crazy right
away. She made him undo It and thÂ«n
she insisted on holding it all the way
down to Thirty-third street. One man
said it might be President of the United
States some day; and Colonel Balldridge
said, 'Yes, it has unknown possibilities
it may even be a President's wife'â Just
like that. But I thought ma would, be
demented. It was all fat and so warm
and sleepy It could hardly hold Its eyes
open, and I believe she'd have kept it
then and there if the policeman would
have let her. She made him promise to
get it a bottle of warm milk the first
thine, and borrowed $20 of the colonel to
give to the policeman to get it things with
and then all the way down she talked
against the authorities for allowing such
thingsâ as if they could help itâ and when
we got home she criedâ you know you did,
maâ and you pretended it was toothacheâ
and ever since then she's been perfectly
daft about babies. Why, whenever she
sees a woman going along with, one she
thinks the poor thing is going to leave it
some place; and now she's in with the
"charity workers and says she won't leave
New York at all this summer."
"I don't care," protested the guilty
mother, "It would have frozen to death
in just a little while and it's done so of
ten. Why, up at the Catholic Protectory
they put out a basket at the side door,
so a body can leave their baby, in it and
ring the bell and run away; and they get
one twice a week sometimes; and this
was such a sweet, fat little baby with big
blue eyes and its forehead wrinkled and
it was all puckered up around Its little
nose "
"And that isn't the worst of
it," the relentless daughter broke
in. "She gets begging letters by
the score and gives money to all sorts
of people, and a man from the Charities
Organization, who had heard about it,
came and warned her that they were im
postors â only she doesn't care. Do you
know, there was a poor old blind woman
with a dismal, wheezy, organ down at
Broadway and Twenty-third streetâ the
organ would hardly play at all, and just
one wretched tuneâ only the woman
wasn't blind at all we found outâ and ma
bought her a nice new organ that cost
seventy-five dollars and had it taken to
her. Well, she found out through this
man from the Organization that. the wo
man pawned the new organ for twenty
dollars and was still playing on the old
one. She didn't want a new one because
it was too cheerful; it didn't make people
sad when they heard It. like her old one
did. And ' yesterday ma bought an In
dian â "
"A what?" asked her brother, in amaze
ment.
"An Indianâ a tobacco sign." '
"You don't mean it? One of those lads
that stand out in front and peer under
their hands to see what palefaces are
moving into the house across the street?
Say. ma, what you going to do with him?
There isn't much room here, you know."
"I didn't buy him for myself," replied
Mrs. Bines, with dignity; "I wouldn't
want such an object."
"She bought it," explained his sister,
"for an Italian woman who keeps a little
tobacco-shop down in Rlvlngton street. A
man goes around to repaint them, you
know, but hers was so battered that this
man told her it wasn't worth painting
again, and she'd better get another, and
the woman said she didn't know what to
do because they coat twenty-five dollars
for a new one."
"Buti she has to support five children,
and her husband hasn't been able to work
for three years, since he fell through a
fire-escape where he was sleeping one hot
night," pleaded Mrs. Bines, "and I think
I'd rather stay here this summer. Just
think of all those poor babies when the
weather gets hot. I never thought there
were so many babies In the world."
"Well, have your own way," said her
son. "If you've started out to look after
all the babies in New York you won't
have any time left to play the races, I'll
promise you that."
"Well, my son. I neverâ"
"But sis here would probably rather do
other things."
"I think." said Psyche. "I'd like New
portâMrs. Drelmer says I shouldn't think'
of going away any place else. Only, of
course, I can't go there alone. She says
she would be glad to chaperone me, but
her husband hasn't had a very good year
in Wall street, and she's afraid she won't
be able to go herself."
"Maybe," began Mrs. Bines, "If you'd
offerâ"
"Oh! ehe'd be offended," exclaimed
Psohe.
"I'm not so sure of that," said her
brother, "not if you suggest it in the
right wayâ put it on the ground that
you'll be quite helpless without her, and
that she'd oblige you world without end
and all that. The more I see of people
here the more I think they're quite rea
sonable in little matters like that. They
look at them in the right light. Just lead
up to it delicately with Mrs. Drelmer and
see. /Then if she's willing to go with you,
your summer will be provided for; ex
cept that we shall both have, to look in
upon Mrs. Juzzlebraggin here now and
then to see that she doesn't overplay the
game and get sick herself, and make sure
that they don't get her vaccination mark
away from her. And, ma, you'll have to
come off on the yacht once or twice, Just
to give it tone."
It appeared that Percival had been right
in" supposing that Mrs. Drelmer might be
led to regard Psyche's proposal in a light
entirely rational. She was reluctant, at
first, it is true.
"It's awfully dear of you to ask me,
child, but really I'm afraid it will be
quite impossible. Oh!â for reasons which
you, of course, with your endless bank
account, cannot at all comprehend. You
see we old New York families have a se
cure position here by right of birth; and
even when we are forced to practice lit
tle economies in dress and household man
agement it doesn't count against usâ so
long as we stay here. Now, Newport is
different. One cannot economize gTace
fully thereâ not even one of us. There
are quiet and very decent places for
those of us that must. But at Newport
one must not fall behind in display. A
sense of loyalty to the others, a nob
lesse oblige, compels one to be as lavish
as those flamboyant outsiders ' who go
there. One doesn't want them to report,
you know, that such and such families
of our smart set are falling behind for
lack of means. So, while we of the real
stock- arc chummy enough here, where
there is only us in a position to observe
ourselves, there is a sort of tacit agree
ment ' that only those shall go down to
Newport who are able to keep up the
pace. One need not, for one reason or so,
be a cottager; but, for example, in the
matter of dress, one must be sinfully lav
ish. Really, child. I could spend three
months in the Engadlne for the price of
one decent month at Newport; the para
sols, gloves, fans, shoes; 'frillies'â enough
to stock the Rue de laPalx. to say noth
ing of gownsâ but why do I run on? Here
am I with a few little simple summer
things, fit enough indeed for the quiet
but ab-so-Iute-ly impossible for Newportâ
so say no more about it, dear. ' You're a
sweetâ but It's madness to think of it."
"And I bad," reported Psyche to
her mother that night, "such a
time getting . her to agree'. At first
she wouldn't listen at all. Then, after
I'd Just fairly begged her, she admitted
she might because she's taken such a
fancy to me arid hates to leave meâ but
she was sensitive about what people
might say. I told "her they'd never have
a chance to say a word; and she was
anxious Perce shouldn't know, because
she says he's so cynical about New York
people since that Milbrey girl made such
a set for him; and at last she called me a
dear and consented, though she'd been
looking forward to a quiet summer. To
morrow early we start out for the shops."
So it came that the three members of
the Bines family pursued during the sum
mer their, respective careers of diversion
under conditions moat satisfactory to
each.
The steam yacht Viluca, , chartered by
Percival, was put Into commission early
in June. Her first cruise of ten days was
a signal triumph. His eight guests were
the men with whom he had played poker
so tirelessly during the winter. Perhaps
the moat illuminating log of that cruise
may be found In the reply of one of them
whom Percival Invited for another early
In July.
"Much obliged, old man, but I haven't
touched a drop now. in, over. three weeks.
My doctor ' says ' I must let it 'be for at
least two months, and I mean to stick
by him. Awfully kind of you. though!"
CHAPTER XXIV.
THE SIGHT OF A NEW BEAUTY, AND
SOME ADVICE FROM HIGBEE.
From the landing on a still morning in
late July, Mrs. Drelmer surveyed the fleet
of sailing and steam yachts at anchor in
Newport harbor. She was beautifully and
expensively gowned In nun's grey chiffon;
her toque was of chiffon and lace, and she
held a pale grey parasol. Its ivory handle
studded with sapphires. She fixed a glass
upon one of the white, sharp-nosed steam
yachts that* rode in the distance near
Goat Island.
"Can you tell me if that's the Viluca?"
she asked a sailor landing from a dinghy,
"that boat just astern of the big
schooner?"
"No ma'am; that's the Alta, Commcdote
Weckford." '
"Looking for some one?" inquired a
voice, and she turned to greet Fred Mil
brey descended the steps.
"Oh! good morning! yes; but they've
not come in, evidently. It's the Vilucaâ
Mr. Bines, you know; he's bringing his
sister back to me. And you?"
"I'm expecting the folks on Shepler's
craft. Been out two weeks now. and
were to have come down from New Lon
don last night. They're not in sight
either. Perhaps the gale last night kept
them back."-
Mrs. Drelmer glanced above to where
some one seemed to be waiting for him.
"Who's your perfectly gorgeous com
panion? You've been so devoted to her
for three. days that you've hardly bowed
to old friends. Don't you want her to
know any one?"
The young man laughed with an air of
great shrewdness.
"Come, now, Mrs. Drelmer, you're too
good a friend of Mauburn'sâ about his
marrying, I mean. You fixed him to
tackle me low the very first half of one
game we know about, right when I was
making a fine run down the field, too.
I'm going to have better interference thi3
time." ' )
"Silly! Your chances are quite as good
as his there this moment." ' â¢
"You may think so; I know better."
"And of course. In any other affair, I'd
never think ofâ"
"P'r'aps so; but I'd rather not chance
It Just yet." - â¢
"But who is she? What a magnificent
mop of hair. It's like that rich piece of
ore Mr. Bines showed us, with copper and
gold in it."
"Well, I don't mind telling you she's
the widow of a Southern gentleman.
Colonel Brench Wybert."
"Ah, indeed! I did notice that two-inch
band of black at the bottom of her ac
cordeon-plaited petticoat. I'll wager
that's a Rue de la Paix Idea of mourning
for one's dead husband. And she con
fides her grief to the world with such
charming discretion. Half the New York
women can't hold their skirts up as
daintily as she does it. I dare say, now.
her tears could be dried?â by the right
comforter?"
Milbrey looked important.
"And I don't mind telling you the late
Colonel Brench Wybert left her a fortune
made In Montana copper. Can't say how
much, but two weeks ago she asked the
governor's advice about where to put a
spare million and a half In cash. Not so
bad. eh?"
"Oh, this new plutocracy! Where do
they get it?"
"How old. now, should you say she
was?" ,
Mrs. Drelmer glanced up again at the
color-scheme of heliotrope seated in a vic
toria upholstered in tan brocade.
"Thirty-five. I should sayâ about."
"Just twenty-eight."
"Just about what I should sayâ she'd
say."
"Come now, you women can't help It,
can you? But you can't deny she's stun
ning?"
"Indeed I can't! She's a beautyâ Â«nd.
good luck to you. Is that the Viluca com
ing in? No; it has two stacks; and It's
not your people because the Lotus is
black. I shall go back to the hotel. Bertie
Trafford brought me over on the trolley.
I must find him first and do an errand in
Thames street."
At the head of the stairs they parted.
Milbrey joining the lady who had waited
for him.
Hers was a person to gladden the eye.
Her figure, tall and fun, was of a grace
ful and abundant perfection of contours;
her face, precisely carved and showing
the faintly generous rounding of matur
ity, was warm in coloring, with dark eyes,
well shaded and languorous; her full lips
betrayed their beauty in a ready and
fascinating laugh; her voice was a rich,
warm contralto, and her speech bore just
a hint of thÂ« 'soft r-less drawl of the
South.
She had blazed into young Mllbrey's
darkness one night in the palm-room of
the Hijrhtower Hotel, escorted by a
pleased and beefy youth of. his acquaint
ance, who later told him of their meeting

"Sorry to have kert you waiting. The

"Who was your elderly friend?" she
asked, as they were driven slowly up the
old-fashioned street.
"Oh! that's Joe Drelmer. She's not so
old, you know; not a -ay over 40, Joe
can't be; fine old stock; she was a Ley

of the very oldest in New York. Awfully
exclusive. Down to meet friends, but
they'd not shown up, either. That re

from your part of the countryâ the

"But it was not until my husband be

"No. Bines; they'll be here presently,
and you can meet them, anyway."
" "Is there an old fellowâ a aueer old

"No, only a son and daughter and a
mother." . ,
"Of course I aha'n't mind meeting
any mends or yours, sne saia, wuu

I always understood that you Knicker

I do recall this name now. I remember
hearing tales of the family In Spokane.
They're a type, you know, f One Â»Â«es
many of the sort there. They make a

Yes. I do recall this family. There is a
daughter, you say?"
"Yes; Miss Psyche Bines."
â¢'Psyche; ah, yes: it's the same family.
I recollect perfectly now. You know they
tell the funnust tales of them out there.
Her mother found the name 'Psyche' in
a book, and liked it, but she pronounced
it 'Pishy.' and so the girl was called until
she became old enough to go to school
and learned better."
â¢\Oear me: fancy now!"
"And there are countless tales of the
mother's sayings. Once a gentleman
whom they were visiting in San Fran
cisco was showing her a cabinet of curior.
'Now, don't you find the Pompelian fig
urines exquisite?' he asked her. The poor
creature, after looking around her help

but that she liked the California nectar

"You don't tell me: gad! that was a
good one. Oh, well, she's a meek, harm
less old soul, and really, my family's not
the snobbish sort, you know."
In from the shining sea late that after
noon steamed the Viluca. As her chain
was rattling through the hawse-hole,
Perdval. with his sister and Mauburn,
came on deck.
"Why. there's the Chicagoâ Hlgbee's
yacht."
"That's the boa* " said Mauburn, "that's
been piling the white water up in front
of her all afternoon trying to overhaul
us."
"There's Millie Higbee and old Silas,
now."
"And, as I live," exclaimed Psyche,
"there's the Baron de Paltiac between
them!" i
"Sure enough." cald her brother. "V, e
must call ma up to see him dressed in
those sweet, pretty yachting flannels. Oh.
there you are!" as Mrs. Bines Joined
them. "Just take this class and treat
yourself to a look at your old friend, the

"Doesn't the baron look just too distin

watching them.
"And doesn't Higbee look Just too Chi

brother.
The Higbee craft cut her way grace

and launches from both yachts now pre

While they were waiting the Higbee party

"Hello!" said Higbee. "If I'd known

"It's much better you didn't recognize

"Know the baron here?" â¢
Of course we know the baron. Ah,

"Ah, ha! very charmed, Mr. Bines and
Miss Bines; it is of a Ions time that we

He was radiant; they had never before

him with an air of proud ownership.

EH CHARLES CO.. 19 Park PlÂ»=Â». NÂ»Â» York."We make too much mystery of electric
ity." says Charles P. Steinmetz. "We
really know more about It than we do
about other phenomena. Take gravity,
for Instance. Who knows what it is,
why It acts, and how? We do know how
to handle electricity, how to produce It,
how it acts through distance, and so on,
but no one knows why the earth attracts
the stone, always attracts it, and always
acts on it. Every one sees gravity act
and does not think anything about it, but
it seems a sort of fashion to regard elec
tricity as a great mystery. We even hear,
nowadays, that some scientists are trying
to prove that the mystery of life and
death is due to electricity. Our bodies
are dynamos, and not furnaces, they tell
us. Well, I do not think the case gia
proved. Electrical energy produces a pHy
elologlcal effect, but so do other forms of
energy. Life Itself is a form of energy,
but the relation of the two is not shown.
We do not know that the action of nerves
and muscles Is due to electricity. It is
an interesting theory, but still academic."

"By Jove! it's me!"
"It looked so homely and inviting, I
suppose, that I couldn't resist it," he ex

rising in her cheeks, while she tapped
the polished floor with the steel in a
nervous, embarrassed way.
In a moment she had recovered her
self.
"Slute you are in I hope you like the

stopped to think what Mrs. Lofty would

"Not a bit," he assured her heartily,
while the peculiar compression of the lips

"Have I ever told you about mine?"
He shook his bead.
She pointed out through the window
with the point of her foil in the direction
cf the great dark hotel which frowned
down upon them.
"I am Jasper Clark," he said simply,
and at that name they both stared at him
in amazement; "I know you'll forgive an
old man for listening." Then with a bow
he continued, whimsically: "I should very
much like the pleasure of your company

moments before as he' made a gesture
toward the Millionaires' Club over the

the old gentleman was standing before
them.
"No one wants you to turn her out,
I'm sure. But I don't see why she can't
live In the city with your brother?"
"Iâ I must go In," she said.
"Not until you've mentioned what you
have against my mother," and he deliber
ately barred her way.
Martha's temper rose. "I wouldn't
live with her for a farm!" she cried.
"She's as still as death. I like to sing,
and laugh, and make a cheerful clatter,
but your mother's house Is as silent as
a tomb. You can hear a pin drop there
any time."
Philip ' heaved a great sigh of relief.
"Mother wouldn't object. to your clatter,"
he said smilingly. - 'as that all?"
"All? Isn't that enough? Besides, I
don't believe In living In the same house
with my mother-in-law/'
Philip's face clouded. "I can't turn my
mother out, even to please you, Martha,"
he said. : v
This year it was later than usual. Mrs.
Lindsley had finished house cleaning
when he climbed the steep bill road that
led to the old Raymond homestead. It
was early in the evening, and Martha was
busy among her flower beds. 8he looked
up with a conscious smile when the little
gate clicked behind him. â¢'.Â¦'
"Good evening, Phil," she said, "did
you come to get some violets?"
"No," . he replied bluntly, "I came to
set you. Can't I. Martha?"
"Not if I must live with your mother,
Phil." she said with an air of finality.
To her surprise he did not, as before,
turn dejectedly away. There was a de
termined look In his eyes, before which
she trembled.
cause of Philip's woe. Every year he had
said, "Martha," won't ' you marry me
now?" and Martha had replied, "Not If I
must live with your â¢mother, Phil."
Strange to say, he had never asked her
to be more explicit; he had no idea of her
reason for refusing to live with his moth
er. It was enough for him that she re
fused.
One beautiful Sabbath morning In June Martha Raymond sat
on the broad doorstep waiting for the "first bell" to ring for
church. Her brother and his wife and little daughter werÂ«
visiting her. Ruth was to accompany her to church.
The child was playing In the old-fasn
ioned garden, where larkspurs and roses
ran wild. Martha called her. and she
came running up with her hands full of
blossoms.
"Pitty Towers." she said. "RufÂ© put
some In Aunt Marfa's hair." and she
climbed up on the broad stone and peeped
roguishly Into Martha's face.
"Only the blue flowers, dearieâ the- lark
spurs. Auntie doesn't wear red In her
hair."
"Yeth." lisped the sweet baby voice,
"pltty b'u Towers In auntie's hair/' and
she tucked a crimson rambler among tha
soft red colls. Then she slipped her lit
tle hand Into Martha's and they went to
church together.
Philip and his mother sat directly be
hind them. The old lady looked inquir
ingly at the little child, but Philip's eyes
sought Martha's hair. Just as they had
done In vain for two lone years. He
half rose from his seat, for there waa
the blessed red signal at last. He rub
bed his eyes and looked again, and when
the minister read. "What went ye out
to see?" he murmured, "A red flower, ot
course." His mother laid a reproving
hand on his arm. "Hush." she whispered,
just as she had whispered years ago to
the restless youngster beside her.
Early that afternoon he climbed the hill
road. Martha's brother answered his
knock. She was In the garden with little
Ruth, he said. He found them there
among the roses and larkspurs.
"Martha," he cried, hurrying down the
gravel path, "how can I thank you,
dear?"
"Thank me?" she said tremulously, "for
what. PhUlp?"
"For wearing this." and he took the
withered rÂ«d rose from her hair.
Her eyes opened wide with surprise. "I
didn't know it was there," she faltered.
"I guess Ruth did It."
"Yeth." the baby lisped. "I dess I did
â pitty b'u Tower."
Philip's face fell. 'So it's all a mis
take," he said sadly.
But Martha put her arms around her
little niece and held her close.
"Tell him," she said, "that Auntie's
glad you put the pretty T>'u Tower* in her
hair."

comes to criticize every one else."
They looked at each other and broke
Into long and merry laughter. Hazard's
worldUness had vanished like a cloud.
'"It's a great Idea, sweetheart," he said
softly, "and I'd like to work to make it
come true. Would you let meâ do you
think "
But the blushes were so violent this
and deliberately 'wreck his own " tram.
There was a straight track for three miles
on the further side of Benson, and the
engineer of the passenger would see the
wreck In ample time to come to a stop.
This plan. If carried out. would prob
ably mean death for Jimmie. but he
analyzed the situation none the less coolly
because of that. Death is something that
engineers get accustomed to facing. But
if he could only discover some way of
letting Nettle know the condition of af
fairs! It would be an easy matter for her
to the derailing switch after he had
passed and allow the rear half of the
train to come to a safe haven In the corn
field beside the track.
Down at the station Nettie heard a
sound which sent her rushing out to the
platform. Away up the hill she could see
a freight train coming down at a terrific
rate of speed. The whistle cord seemed
to be In the hands of a lunatic, for the
whistle was sounding in strange, unearth
ly shrieks. As she watched' It something
struck her as being strangely familiar
about the way the whistle was sounding.
All of a sudden It struck her that there
was method in them, and that, interpret
ed by the Morse code, they were saying.
"BN, BN, BN," her station call. This
was continued for a few seconds, and
then began, "Broke In two. Throw de
railing switch when first section Is past
station." Three times this was repeated
and then the engine went around the
curve at the further end of the loop and
she could hear the whistle only faintly.
But she had heard enough and when
Jimmie's engine whizzed past the station,
with his white face Â¦ pressed closely
against the glass at the side of the en
gine cab, he saw Nettie standing at the
switch. When the last car in the part of
the train which still remained Intact had
passed the frog he saw her throw all her
weight on the switch handle and the sig
nals told him that every one of the cars
which were following ' him would pile
themselves ungracefully, ' but harmlessly
on the soft earth of the cornfield. Bring
ing his ingine to a stop he ran back to
the station and on to the siding In ample
time to let the passentrer train pass him.
Briefly, when the resultant row cleared.
Jimmie was a full-fledged engineer, and
a month later the railroad lost the tele
graph operator at Benson Station and
Jimmie got a wife.
So things went along for a year and
Jimmie's prospects of promotion got little
brighter. On the records of the office of
the superintendent of motive power he
was still merely James Kincaid, -fourth
on* the list of firemen, with a good repu
tation and the prospect of succeeding to
an engine In the course of five or six
years. When business picked up in the
fall a number of extra fjreight trains
were put on and he got his first chance
to run an engine.
On the first trip It fell to his lot to
take out the third section of freight train
No. 106, east bound. Tne . third section
of No. 106 was made up of thirty-one
heavily loaded cars and_ none of these
were equipped with air ' brakes. As he
pulled out of Adairville the old yard mas
ter swung hlmsett up Into the cab of the
engine and said:
"I think ye'll pull the engine all right.
Jimmie, me bye, but for the love of the
saints be careful when you strike the
top of the hill this side of Benson. Faith,
it's a heavy train they've given ye. and
If It should break In two going down that
hill and thlm cyars with no air brakes
on to them, there'll be the devil and all
to pay."
Despite this warning, there was no fear
of a "break in two" In Jimmie's heart as
he nursed his engine along toward the
top of the hill on the other side of which
lay Benson. This Is an accident which
happens very rarely, and which not even
the most experienced engineer can suc-
jokes stopped. Even the head brakeman
of No. 14, who had a reputation aa a wit.
forebore to make remarks about the con
nection between the Morse coda and pret
ty girls.
Benson Station li at the foot of
"Twelve-Mile Hill." and this hill Is re
garded by the engineers as the worst
place on the division. The grade is so
heavy that the track winds up the hill
In two long loops. When you get to the
beginning of the second loop you are
only a mile from Benson Station on a
straight line, but it is six miles distant
by the track. After he had mastered the
rudiments of the Morse code Jimmie
would take hold of the whistle cord when
No. H came to the loop on the down
grade and signal "Hello" to Nettie at
Benson Station In sharp blasts upon the
whistle which stood for the dots and
dashes of the code.

"Excellent! A public sympathizer is

She had grown suddenly earnest, and
her eyes filled with tears. Hazard leaned
toward her in real distress, forgetting
everythingâ the merry clatter of the other
fencing girls, the old gentleman who sat
near them and the swift moving panorama
outsideâ in his amazement over this un

"So Billy of me," she began, with a

he's safe to build on. But when a clerk crawls yito the office in the morning like
a sick setter pup, and leaps from his stool at night with the spring of a tiger, I'm a little afraid that if
I sent him to take charge of a branch house- he wouldn't always be around when customers were.
He's the sort of a chap who would hold back the sun an hour every morning and have it gain two
every afternoon if the Lord would give him the same discretionary powers that he gave Joshua.
And I have noticed that he's the fellow who invariably takes a timekeeper as an insult. He's pretty
numerous in business offices ; in fact, if the glance of the human eye could affect a ciock-face in the
same way that a man's country cousins affect their city' welcome, I should have to buy a new time
piece for the office every morning.
Boys are a good deal like the pups that fellows sell on street corners â they don't always turn
out as represented. You buy a likely setter pup ancj raise a spotted coach dog from it, and the prom

That forecast has a false air of specious originality which
we hasten to disavow. It is but a rearrangement of the
prophecies of Napoleon. "Prussia," the Emperor predicted,

her colonies will turn Portuguese. The role of France will
be purely intellectual. Italy will become united and null. Su
premacy will be divided between England, mistress of
Africa, and Russia, established at the Golden Horn."
Napoleon was speaking of to-morrow â of that chartless
) to-morrow of which the future has charge, or rather of
\ that immovable present in which coming events unfold and
in which he appears to have foreseen Bismarck, perhaps Sa
gasta, indubitably Chamberlain, certainly Garibaldi, but not
the fall of the Dragon and the rise of the Stars and Stripes.
Or, if he did, he omitted to say so. That omission it is
but a duty to supply.
The Dragon, somnolent, yet watchful, for ages has
guarded the walls of Cathay. That Dragon Russia must
i captivate. Should she fail she must take a back seat. Be
' hind the walls is the gorgeousness of gold, mines richer and
' deeper than those of Ormuzd*and the Ind. Russia is none

( quence, the possibilities of that force, China herself does
not know. But Russia does, and, being semi-Asiatic, knows,
1 too, how to deal with both, which is more than can be said
of England. Then. also. China leans to Russia. They are
I natural affinitiesâ what Goethe called Wahlverwandtschaften
, â Arcades ambo, as some one else remarked^ Moreover,
there is the gold. The mineral resources of China, as yet
' barely scratched, are the greatest on earth.

I the plums in the grab-bag. Their possession mean3 eco
( nomic supremacy in the days that Napoleon foresaw. For
that possession war is persumable.
War is humanity's normal condition. On the front page
' of the first history two brothers stand face to face. Their
i ideas conflict. One kills the other. The brothers arc suc
i ceeded by tribes. There are tents and passions. There are
i clans, races, nations, empires. But always the conflict of
i ideas, always the scramble that ensues.
The history of the world is a bulletin of battle. The
' lesson which it disengages is the .right of might The Ro-
I mans expressed it in two"~"words â Vae Victis. They were
i terse; they were also correct. The criterion of war is the
, result. In it there is, save for casuists, no question of jus-
( tice or of injustice. There is a questio:n merely of victory
and defeat. Either makes for peace, but not for its perma
' nence. Such peace would pass all understanding.
1 War is. the paradox of jurisprudence. It sanctions that
1 which is forbidden, honors that which is penalized, and re
\ wards that which is reproved. It is an extralegal proceed
l ing, in which murder is glorified and the scaffold is replaced
I by the triumphal arch. It is all these things, and other3 be
. sides. It is hell, it is sport; but it is humanity's normal
condition.
* When the war- for the grab-bag occurs it will for sheer
1 splendor exceed anything that the world has beheld. For

i will hunt in vain. Beside it the Franco- Prussian argument
. will dwindle into the proportions of a street row and the

Â» bish geography, tear out whole pages and set them up
i anew. There will be the totter f f thrones, the reversal of
i dynasties, the disruption of kingdoms, the effacement of
nations, the passing of the Dragon, the fall of Iran, the sub
sidence of the Crescent, the glow of the sables and the re
modeling of the map.
That remodeling which Napoleon foresaw and which
Russia will oversee is demonstrable not through any gift
which we do j not possess of reading the future, but
through the ability which every one enjoys of construing
the past. It will be in the order of things; in accordance
with a natural law which gives to every dog his day and
every dynasty her night. It will be a logical, evolutionary
and, though revolutionary, too, will, when accomplished,
be accepted, arthe inevitable always is.
For nothing suffices unto itself. A nation is not an ex
ception. A nation resembles love â when it does not in
crease, it diminishes. In the destiny of nations but one thing
is constant, and that is change. What happened to the an
cient monarchies? First Greece, then Rome surpassed
'them. Where is the glory of the one, the grandeur of the
other ? Spain usurped them. Then came England's turn.
The turn of Russia is coming. So is ours.
A century ago, barring a stretch or two here and there,
Spanish rule was dominant over the lower and longer por
tion of theAmericas. Barring an island or two, that rule
extended over the West Indies. In addition Spain pos
sessed hereabouts a number of provinces that are ours to
day. Ultimately the rest will be ours also. We may not
want them, and at present certainly we do not. but we can
not interfere with the law of gravitation. That law will
precipitate Canada upon us. In its wake will come the El
Dorados of the Caribbean, the kingdoms of the departed*
Incas, the monarchies of the Aztecs that are gone. Then
from Alaska to Araucania the flag of the United States of
the Three Americas will float over a union extending from
pole to pole.
The pity is that we shall none of us be here to see it.
But those among the quick will behold the dominion of
the earth shared by two powers, one ruling the Old World
from the Baltic, the other from the Atlantic ruling the New.
There, at least, is the horoscope which every self-respect
ing astrologer must deduce, not merely from the Bear ia
the China Shop and the Napoleonic "predictions, but from
the influences of the Stars, and, particularly, of the Stripes.
Meanwhile Russia has been to us a civil neighbor and a
good friend. Other nations may object to her push, but
there istio reason why they should show their teeth over
our shoulder. There is still less reason why we should un
dertake to interfere. The plums in our garden are big
enough to compensate for any deficit in the grab-bag out
there. .
To Stamboul Persia on the west gives access. To the
cast it provides a base from which to move on India. Hence
its strategic importance. To-day, along the Oxus. beyond
the almond groves of Samarcand. down Jit Hindustan,
masses of Cossacks arc peering. Anything else than peering
would mean war. and at present war is one of the Jew
things that Russia does not want. But once China is hers
the knell of Turkey and ultimately of India, will be ringing.
Everything being possible, perhaps when that day comes
it will be found that from Christianfa to Yeddo. and diag
onally from Spitzbergen to Cape Comorin the sables of Rus-
In the cities of Cathay there once were sewers perfectly <
and prodigiously contrived. In Peking to-day -the streets are i

so the executive. The Flowery Kingdom is a pretty name, {
but lilies that fester smell worse than weeds. The need there
of landscape gardeners, and particularly of practical plum- '
bers, is generally understood, but nowhere so thoroughly as <
on the Nevski Prospect. (
To that appreciation recent festivities are due. After a (
breakfast at Batoum, a surprise party at Mcrv, an al fresco
fete on the Amoor, a banquet at Ncuchwang and the waltz
through Manchuria, now, presently, weather permitting. <
there will follow a grand cotillon in the Yangtse Valley J
with, for a wind-up, a series of state dinners in Peking. \
Such is the Russian programme. Such, rather, is part (
of it Such, too, is the meaning of her saraband. In the
progress of her festivities she has advanced from the Urals
to the Pacific. A few centuries ago she was an insignificant '
monarchy. Her territories now cover one-seventh of the 1
land surface of the globe. Yesterday thCnorthcrn half of I
Asia was within her claws; to-day Manchuria is there be- i
sides. |
Manchuria the has been invited by the powers to vacate.
In September, she says, she will do so.. Perhaps she may,
but only to return. That return is inevitable. It is part of '
her policy. It is part of her destiny. Both are as unstay- !
able as the wind at her back. - (
Somebody said that England conquered half the globe in
a fit of absentmindedness. A fit of abstraction would per- '
haps be more exact. Where England has abstracted Russia !
has absorbed. She has absorbed- steadily, with remarkable'
dvility and without hardly striking a blow. Her policy â 1
ever forward â is one which there is no change of adminis- 1
tration to alter, no incoming government to reverse. As (
fuch H is constant, and, incidentally, the most successful that ,
diplomacy knows. It consists in considering always the end^
never the means; in turning treaties into memoranda of*
agreements that are not to be kept; in retreating, the better*
to advance; in being never in a hurry, but in getting there (
all the same. That is what she is doing now in Manchuria: {
Manchuria is the key to China. That key once Russia's,
for keeps, so is Peking as well. Then, after a state dinne? in
the Forbidden City, others will follow, .notably, though of
course not immediately, in Stamboul, Delhi and Ispahan. 1
Already the Shah of Persiaâ the Shah-an-Shah, King Â« f \
Kings, Regent of the Prophetâ is to Russ'a but a smlcr in

guard the ruins of the palaces of Xerxes and of Darius arc 1
impotent to release him. He may turn from the divan to '
the mosque, from Saadi to the Koran, from bulbuls to '
Krupps â he is doomed. And doomed, too, sooner or later, I

l*BÂ»â¢ H "^BHi9 perhaps, too, certain information which
the press does not provide.
There is China's age, for instance. We do not \ know,,
how old she is. Nobody does; , she does not know herself.
Yet in a land where roses have no perfume and women no
petticoats, where paradox is commonplace and everything
goes by contraries, it follows that dates can hardly be pre
served,
Information concerning China's age may therefore never 1
be reached, and would not be of inordinate value if it were, i
But what is curious is the fact that while we cannot com-i
pute her year's we cannot compute her population either.
What is more curious still, she is no wiser than we are. One '
thing, however, is obvious. There are enough Chinese and 1
to spare. Another thing quite as obvious is that any con- 1
tempt we may have for them is flattery by comparison to <
their contempt for us. That point is entirely too agreeable ,
to be omitted. Besides, it is important.
China is an old harridan. She may conceal her age, but
not her rank. She is the dowager of nations, the eldest of '
realms. Anterior to every monarchy and indifferent to all, <
she has sat in history aloof, her skirts of silk about her, in \
an attitude of supreme disdain. Besides her arts and wiles j
those of dead Greece and buried Rome were the creations of ,

little thing which, for lack of a better term, is called the fu-l

Yes, indeed; China at present is a buffer State between'
two powers. As such, one does not need to be a prophet to \
assume that should she become Russian India will follow, '
Asia will be Muscovite, and ultimately Europe as well. i
Behind Russia is the north wind. Where that sweeps \

"I do not effer you the beard as a re

"And the voice in which you offer them
is so far from being your own that you
make roe doubt whether the bills, how
ever gen-u-lne. are gen-u-lnely yours."
"You seem to be a person of some pene

"If ycitbad not thought so before you

lawyer.
"So long as you do not know my real

you know my false beard and false voice.
As for the money, you may take It or
leave it!"
"And that's soon said," replied the law

that neither took them nor left them.
"Try a 6eat," he said standing before an

Judge Barwood had a good gray eye

The thermometer on the jamb of the

"and. now about the bsulness."
"The business Is tbe height of simplic

reasons I object to any one's attempting
to pursue me and to take away the
money."
The visitor also had a good rrsy eye.
"And that's a very natural objection,
too," said the man of law. "The plainest
way to avoid it is to send the money

"If I had been looking for the plainest
way I should not have had to come to
your- Honor for advice."
The two pairs of good, gray eyes looked
into one another with appreciation.
"This," said the Judge, "looks like a
fishy business. And what Is very much

Then was the city of Cornvllle delivered
into the hands of the three bad men, who
opened it as their oyster, and that was
their destined part In the realization of
the Great Idea. . "Fritzie" Gannes, with
his "sure-thing" enterprises, reaped a
harvest which he had never supposed
Cornville could produce. He learned that
a town Is never so gullible as when re
form attempts to tell It that it* "shan't."
"Soapy" Wadlow and "Frenchy" Lalane
made similar agreeable discoveries. The
new police force could no more tell when
a pocket was being picked; they couldn't
even tell when one had been picked, un
less they found the "weeded leather" on
the ground, and "Soapy" and "Frenchy"
dipped deep with Impunity. It is also to
be remarked that they were not called on
to pay a percentage of their winnings to
the "wise." Indeed, the three were so
pleased with their success that they de
termined to combine Interests and make
a "run" on Richard Englar's bank. It
was decided that the easiest way to
achieve the "run" was to approach the
building through a subterranean passage,
and the three started to dig a tunnel.
When affairs were in this posture and
the tunnel nearly complete, Ruderick Me-
Klowd stepped one day off a train which
had brought him out of the beyond. Th.e
Great Idea had taken him away from
'Cornvllle soon after Herbert Renshaw
was elected Mayor, and It was the Great
Idea that brought him back. He went
straight from the train to the Front Of
fice.
"I should like to see the chief," he said.
The chief granted the desired Interview.
"Mr. Cowles." Ruderick began. "I have
been given to understand that you are
looking for a new man for your detective
force. I have had considerable experi
ence in the detective business, and should
like to be your new man. if you're satis
fled with my credentials. Do you care
to look at them?"
The reform administration "allowed"
that it would like to see Rudcric&'s cre
dentials.
"I see that you are certified to as being
a very 'wise' man." remarked Mr. Cowles
after a hasty perusal of Ruderlck's pa
pers. "I suppose that word 'wise' Is
merely a technical term in police par
lance,"
"That's what it is, Mr. Cowles."
"You have some acquaintance, have
you, with the criminal classes? We very
much need a pan who understands the
ways of thieves."
"Of course. I don't set myself up as
anything extraordinary, Mr. Cowles, but
you've rot my record In those papers. I
certainly ought to know something about
the criminal classes."
"Well, Mr. MeKlowd, I'll take your
name Into consideration and notify the
authorities th'at you have made applica
tion for the position. I will send you
their decision to-morrow. Good after
noon, sir."
"Good afternoon. Mr. Cowles."
Three days later there was astonish
ment, bewilderment and profanity In the
under world. Ruderick MeKlowd had been
appointed Chief of Detectives in the town
of Cornvllle. and the under world won
dered what the appointment meant. Rud
erick MeKlowd's office was besieged by
guns, who desired to know what was
what and what was "doing." Among the
besiegers were three who had come by
special summons. The three bad men
were invited into Ruderick's private of
fice, where, by Judicious' questioning,
they were made to declare that thex had.,
nothing whatever "on" and had not done
any business in the town since the re
form administration went into power, and
that they had been "ditched" by Rud
erick's idea, and were sick of the place
and ready to quit it.
To all of this Ruderick listened with
politeness. When they had finished his
reply was exemplary and significant.'
"Blokts." he said, "1 ain't much on
chewin' the rag, but I'm more'n a little
glad o' what you've told me, 'n* that
you're sick o' the town. I'm particular
glad you're not mixed up in that tunnel
business under EnglaVs Bank.- The fel
lers that's done that has got to choke it
offâ see? I can't stand for It. Anythln'
else 'ts been done 'fore I got here ain't
any o' my business. # For yourselves, my
tip as an old pal, since you're sick o' this
town, is to get shet of it by the next rat
tler. I guess you've made your pile here,
anyhow, an' It's time *t you get your
graft in elsewhere. If you sprint you can
catch that 7:30 this evenln'. It 'ud give
me a pain to 6ee you here after 8 o'clock
to-r.Ight. So long, blokes. Take care o*
One eveningâ Â«lx days and Â«a fraction,
to be accurate, after Ruderlck's historic
warning to the three bad menâ Judge
Barwood was summoned from his bed by
an importunate visitor, who made him
self agreeable by opening his business
with the tender of a retaining fee. The
"How much more, for example r*
"Well, say a second fifty thousand. Too
could hardly make a deal with leas.**
"I have stolen a second fifty thousand."
Â¦aid the visitor, drawing a considerable
parcel from under his cloak and laying 1 it
on the table. "I calculated myself that
It would take Just about a second fifty to
protect the first."
"You seem to be a client of rreai tore
thought," said the lawyer.
"It needs a client of great forethought
to employ an attorney of great penetra
tion." said the visitor. T-''~?'f.
"It is only left to settle where' and whÂ«n
I am to let you know what I have done.
I suppose you can trust yourself not to
rÂ«t caught." said Barwood.
This was unkind; the powers that rule
were become a Joke In Cornvllle, and
Renshaw, who had been Barwood' s rival.
was the point of the Joke.
"I can trust myself a rood deal better
cot to ret caught If I don't trust any one
â¢!*â¢ with my address. When Z want to
know what you have done Z will oome
and ask you. Good night, Mr. Attorney. "
"Good night. Mr. Scamp.**
The two men parted with mutual re
spect and rood wilL
Barwood had made It a point of eon
science In the conduct of his life, when
be had a thing to do which was agreeable
to himself and disarreeable to some one
else, never to procrastinate. There was
besides another reason In the present case
for dispatch. It did not enter into his
views for his client that Richard Enrlar
should not have a chance to keep his loss
unknown. â¢ â¢
"Mr. Enrlar/*Â»he said, with the rerret
which a man throws Into his vole* when
he speaks of the misfortune of a per
sonal enemy, "I am Informed that you
have Just been robbed of a hundred thou
sand. A man so bundled up that I could
name nothing of him visited me at my
house Just now and told me so; he added
that you could not find him, and that
If you did find him the money would be
either dissipated or spent In conducting
his defense. If you guarantee to make
no effort to find him and to keep the
affair oat of the hands of the State he
offers you $25,000; J25.0OO to take or leave.
I don't know whether this offer Is real
either, nor how he expects you to rat
the money. Certainly he gave me no
name or address. He told me nothing 1
but what I state and then he took his
leave. I made no attempt to lay hands
on him. I didn't want to deprive you
of your chance to recover $25,000. nor our
new police forco of Its chance of distin
guishing Itself."
There Is, singularly, little more to tell.
Englar and his Board of Directors had
a meeting before daylight that morning,
ascertained the truth and 'moved motions
and passed resolutions. They resolved to
. get. the, thief If they could; they. resolved
that they could not afford to let * $25,000
slip through their fingers: they resolved
for the, present to keep the loss concealed
from the public press and from the State.
They consulted with Judge Barwood and
Instructed him to notify his client, if bis
client should again enter Into communi
cation with him. that they bad taken his
offer under advisement; secretly they em
ployed one Ruderick McKlowd to find
cut what he could about the robbery.
Judge Barwood's client did not at this
time again enter into communication with
him. and Ruderick found only that the
tunnel, by means of which the' back had
been entered, had been made by one
Gannes. with the assistance of two com
panions named Wadlow and Latanne, re
spectively; but he soon, obtained word
that they were In Philadelphia, actually
In detention at the time, the bank was
broken Into. .Of their whereabouts since
their release nothing could be learned.
Englar said that Ruderick was' as b!r
an ass as the rest of the Front Offlce,
and must have turned "fly cop" because
he could not make a living aa a thief.
The directors of the banlc once more con
sulted with Judge Barwood and instruct
ed him to notify his client, if his client
should again enter into communication
with him, that they accepted his offer.
Some days afterward they bound them
selves, their heirs and assigns in a man
ner and form which Barwood thought
worth $25,000 to himself and his night vis
itor, and in return for the document he
paid that amount.
Two nights later he was going horn*
from bis office In the dusk when a qua
vering voiep demanded an . alms. The
speaker was a patched and battered fig
ure: a dedrepit old man. wildi-eyed and
wild-haired.
I'lt's. only a drink I want." repeated
the beggar, as he shuffled along at Bar
wood's side. "You see 't 'I'm no liarâ I
don't want nothln' to eat. I want a drink.
It only costs a dime. boss.".
They had reached a stretch of field
through which Barwood was wont to
make a short cut to his home, and as he
left the sidewalk and turned into the field
path the beggar suddenly straightened
himself, dropped the whine in his voice
and. tapping Barwood familiarly on the
shoulder, said: "I say, Mr. Attorney,
hana over that agreement that you made
for me with Englar."
A fortnight later Ruderick was dis
charged from the Cornville force for
drunkenness and Incompetence. The ex
pectations he tad raised when Chlof
Cowles engaged him he had not fulfilled.
Upon his discharge he paid a -visit to
Chicago, where he kept a safe deposit
vault, in which he placed, among other
things, the agreement which Judge Bar
wood had obtained for his unknown
client. This was the finishing touch In
the realization of the Great Idea.
"CotsM yon rteal my more!" he asked
gravely, :;_C'j.\. \'- Â¦>
an' me from any ether four stiffs in
town. He'll change the whole force,
thlnktn* they're all crocked, an* them
that's turned out' 11 keep us under cover
out o* eptte. Things are bound to go that
â¢way. en' then we get our gTaft in an'
there ain't no Barwood cround to squeexe
the profits out of us. See?"
Wadlow, Cannes and Latane were sim
ple-minded men who went about their
business with a Hcmeric directness. They
neither read the public prints which fa
%'ored the candidacy of Herbert Renshaw
r.cr urged amonr their acquaintances
â¢ uch reasons as they themselves bad
thought of why it was to the interest of
tt* under world that Mayor Barwood
should not be re-elected. They elmply
cot themselves constituted the cfScial
ruarCians cf the ballot box and judges
cf election in a single ward. They had
been Judges cf election the first time
Mayor Barwood had been a candidate
for the cÂ£oe he held and had found the
control cf the Nineteenth Ward sufficient
The election day came and went. The
â¢ JudrÂ«Â« of election eat about the stove in
the polling booth behind locked doors and
smoked Henry Clay perfectos end drank
whisky and dub soda and received re
ports frota tlnie to time. They sat a
locr time. They made no effort to count
tie votes; they tock turns sleeping, the
sentinels keeping themselves and each
other awake at z.n endless game of 25
cent ante, 110 limit. There was a dispute
In the Thirteenth Ward, which lasted all
the nigst following the close of the polls
and the next day and the night after
that. There was understood to be a dis
pute in the Nineteenth Ward also in re
gard to the adrnissibility of certain votes.
At 7 o'clock on the second morning of the
25-cent ante a message arrived that the
depute In the Thirteenth was settled.
Barwood needed a majority of 500 in the
Nineteenth to elect him, and as the count
etood he had a majority of but 200 odd.
The faces of the four men about the
card table were pray and sticky with
fatigue, but a glance of understanding
passed round es each man turned his
hand forward to make his last bet.
"There's nothln* like an honest count,
blokes, is there?" remarked Kuderic*.
with a yawn.
When Mayor Renshaw came into his
'kingdom be governed It co as to save his
own fouI. He h:.d eworn to execute the
law, and it -was no part of his reading of
the rules of duty that a man should get
bbnipett damned out of a consideration for
other people! Mayor Rcnthaw closed the
dance haJ".s. He closed the Rambling hells
alM, which Is to say he scattered gam
bling broadcast throughout the town.
Before his accession to office there had
been a limitÂ«-d number of more or less
recognised and *e*ponslble epots in the
town whf-re a man who was determined
' to lose money might do so without great
risk of violence or fraud: after his acces
sion to ofP.ce a man never knew whether
be was "up against" mathematics or
eÂ«ralnst the pzme which is called "the
sure thins"; therefore, since the charm of
"adventure was a new and 6trange one In
Cornville, every one who gambled at all
gambled more and ofte!>er in Mayor Ren
â¢shaw's reign than before. Drinking places
he did not close, because he could not,
though he limited them strictly to the
terms of their license; wherefore willful
men drank by the botf.e after hours In
stead of by the glass. But his great
achievement was the creation of a police
force that did not know how to wink.
The Inability cf Edv.ln Cowlss Eiq. to
k
Frltzle" Gannes. "Soapy" Wadlow and
â¢â¢Frenchy" Latane. In the class beneath
Ruderick McKlowd they were the great
est and tan*t envied under world celebri
ties living in the community. "Frltzie"
was a gamester from London. "Soapy"
was a "tool" frcir. Frisco and Â¦'Frenchy"
*as a '-stair 1 from Quebec.
These three bad men detested "pose." In
the event of Renshaw's election as Mayor
the three, believed that Cornvllle would
reauxa* a pose of rectitude which would
hurt tbetr business. Therefore when Ren
Â¦haw's nomination was announced they
took counsel with themselves and with'
Rufierick for the defeat of Renshaw.
Ruderlck did not rive advice unless hs
felt like It. and for tie most part be
dld cct f*el HkÂ« It. He looked upon
"chewlar the rar" as a vanity, useless
before a man has done bis Job and ruin
ous afterward. He was by temperament
a "aisfle-bacded" specialist; what he bad
to 60 professionally be liked* to do alone,
and no questions asked and no tales told.
Thar* were times, however, when Rud
erick saw 00 lets for bis own band In
gvoaral discussion. and "Frits!*,**
**Boapy** and **TrÂ«nehjr** dropped In upon
him MX a time when be was medltatlnr
the greet Idea. "Frltxle" was the spokes
r*", and he rave Ruderlck conclusive
arrsmests why Herbert Renshaw Esq.
should not be elected Mayor of Cora
"If he's elected." "Fritzle" explained,
'"well all bare to mooch, and the runs
that ain't knewn here'll come to town
an' tip it open an' get all the plunder.
That hajpens every time a reform ad

lck. Tea retiln* sick of It. I've rot my
stake la Barwood, an' I think we ought
to elect fcla. Who you goln* to work for,
Ruderick? Barwood or Rcr.shaw?"
The great idea had already found lodg
ment In Ruderick's mind previous to the
visit ef tie trio. Had they called on him
a fÂ«w davs earlier they would in all
probability have found him amenable to
the'.r suggestions, but they postponed
their visit too leng. At the time of their
call cr. hlra he had decided \o throw his
lr.nuer.ee en the tide of the reformers.
"There's reform administration, an'

THE GREAT IDEAIt Is In view of these facts that my
Government Is pending bo large a dele
cation and exhibit to the Exposition at
f?t. Ix>uis. Th* United States conferred
the honor cf requesting this and the Gov
ernment felt that it was the least ac
knowledgment it could make to send this
Important representation. It wishes to
show America and es much of the rest
bf the worlfl as may be there to see some
thing of China's achievements. _
I find the prevailing Impression that
*he is narrow. "What:" an American
wJfl to me the other day. "is it not true
that China is showing great broadmlnd-"
fdne*s of late? We henr that Â«he is tak-;
Ing up American and European ideas."
"Eo you think that her broadmindedncii
Is a novelty," I replied. "Do you not
realize that China has beÂ»n and Is ojae"'of
the broadest nations in the world? -j It Is
strange how little is known aboutf/'her
, vars."
I hear people eay that ehe is slow to
take up modern Inventions. True enough
in a way. How many useless patents are
*.hrust upon the market! China takes her
time, is conservative, separates the wheat
from the chaff and in due time adopts all
that is worth adopting. Yes, our country
Is slow, but It is very sure and. it does
"not reject new things becauee'they are
new.
' But as to commercialism: in that re
spect possibly we may epeak of a new
China, for it Is quite recently, that we
have had such an amount of commerce as
we have now. We want that to Increase
many fold. It will be of mutual benefit,
helping us and helping the nations that
deal with us. Commerce Is a great edu
cator. It Is commerce that first brings
nations in touch with one another and
that contact results in much learning.
There Is no race too wise to learn, no race
t oo ignorant to teach. The more that men
know of men the better all around.
China and the United States are in the
very beginning of their acquaintance.
They have each made their bow of recog
nition, as it were, and now the conversa
tion opens. May It grow and continue is
the wish of our Government and people.
The greatest amount of our commercial
intercourse is with England. England
had at the last time I took account of the
â¢ matter S5 i>cr cent of the chipping and a
. large per eÂ«nt of the other trade interests*
There should be a far larger amount of '
dealing with the United States than there
now is. We arc neighborsâ only an "ocean,
no land, between us, so that communica
tion Is direct, even though slow.
Most of our railroads are built accord
ing to English style. There arc a num
ber of them running in different directions
back into the interior of China. I might
cive you their names, but I am afraid
they would be entirely meaningless, and
unpronounceable, for they go by long Chi
nese names instead of English ones.
These roads arc traveled by the regula
tion English coaches, entirely different
from your cars that liold so many pcr-
Thcn? is nov: one line built by American
enterprise and conducted according to
American way?. It has your style ' of
cars. It Is in every respect entirely Amer
ican.
Of course, much traveling Is still done
by means of ecdan chairs, as In olden
times, and they are a. most excellent
means of conveyance. They have been
much* Improved in comfort. One of the
exhibits at St. Louis will be of old chairs
such as our forefathers used, and it will
be seen how they have changed. Wheel
barrows arc used to some extent now as
vehicles . China has as yet no streetcars.
But the modern and carefully perfected
railroads are only one feature of China's
modernntrSs. "The New China," like "the
New America," uses many forms of elec
tricity. You will no longer flnd our im
portant business buildings and houses
lighted by little nut oil lamps of the type
that you buy In Chinatown for souvenirs.
We have electric lights Just as other
countries do. You will also flnd . tele
phones and telegraphs when you visit usâ
may that be at an early date!
Buildings in the large cities are much
like yours, especially in Shanghai and
Hongkong, where the foreign settlements
are large. They are not high enough yet
to satisfy lofty ambitions nor to make
elevators an essential. There are no sky
pcrapers. So far as I know *""hlna has
only one elevator, which la in a building
In Shanghai,
Â¦he were now for the first tVm* be
ginning to live. 'â¢China la at last sitting
tip and taking notice," I have heard some
one say. It eeems to me that you are Just
beginning to "s*.t up and take notice" of
the land. across the Pacific.
The United States is a great country.
China appreciates this fact and feels the
strongest sentiments of friendship toward
j-our people who have treated her bo
well In many ways. We want to build
cp a firm friendship between the two na
tions: but In crder to do this there must
be a thorough understanding between the
two. We have much to learn about you:
Rnd, believe me, you have muctv^to learn
about us.

LASSOING WILD
HORSESis no question. But that one's gowns all
have an old, worn-out look Is just as cer
' tain. Fortunately, there- are a-great
v many devices and many of 'these are of
such a nature that they really improve
the appearance of the dress so that it
looks better than when It was new.
Particularly can the white cjoth dresses
be renovated and it Is.^fter all, a saving
to purchase one of these gowns, for It
looks nice from the beginning of the
chapter to the end. It Is becoming from
the time It is put on In all its immaculate
whiteness to the time when, half worn
out, it is treated to one of the many de
vices known to the modistes, whose duty
it is to make over these gowns so that
, they shall look Just like new.
A white cloth dress recently furnished
an excellent example of. this. Never an
elegant gown, it was, nevertheless,' very
pretty and when white and clean it was
the best gown in the owner's wardrobe.
But soon it became soiled around the foot
and then heroic treatment* was necessary.'
The gown was taken to a French modiste
and, under her nimble fingers, it sobn
became new againâ and better than new.
Around the foot of the skirt she placed
a very deep trimming of black lace. The
lace was coarse and was not more than
three inches wide, so that it was neces
sary to put it on- in scroll fashion, leav
ing great open scrolls or ovals. The pat
tern when completed reached to the
knees. Then, in the big open scroll-like
places the French modiste embroidered
sflowers,. choosing big roses with stems
and leaves.
Of course, she did the work quickly and
cleverly, appllqueing a rose here and there
and working the leaves and stems by
hand. When completed this gown was
one of the handsomest' of the middle sum
mer.
' An Innocent Little Device.
There is a very Innocent device which Is
being practiced by the girl who likes to
look pretty, as well as by the girl who
wants to catch a beau. And this is the
device of the flowered hat Hats are worn
wreathed with' blooms this season, and it
is a very wise girl who will provide her
self with a "French wreathâ as these
wreaths are calledâ made of almost every
flower that grows. â¢ ..'-
A Newport girl who owns a black chip
hat, with low crown and spreading brim,
possesses a wreath of small pink roses;
she also has one. of roses of exaggerated
size, tapering to small roses at the back.
Besides these .she has a thick, heavy rope
of violets ready to be thrown around the
hat, and she has wreaths of branching ,
orchids,, of trailing hyacinths and of
masses of the most brilliant scarlet gera
niums.
With half a dozen wreaths snugly put
away in her trunk she is able to trim a
hat at a minute's notice. By taking out a
wreath, winding It around a hat and se
curing it with pins, she has at once a
new bat.
It is the thing to match your hat to
your costume, or your costume to your '
hat, and no self-respecting summer wom
an will fall to do this.
To makÂ» the matter easier and the cos
tume more complete, she can match her
sash ribbons to her hat and her parasol
to both. A chou of the same fastened
primly to the front of the fichu finishes
the very neat aspect of this summer re
galia.
, .-.. The Back of the Gown.
A summer dress that has seen the
bright days of May, the verdant days of
June and the high suns of July Is apt to
show. the earmarks of its experience. It
gives * out in various places, showing
shrinkages here and faded spots there,
â¢while a pulled and drawn look' tells that
it has suffered something from occasional
showers.
The plaited or the tucked skirt Is not
so liable to give out early in its career as
is the skirt with the habit back. For the
habi^ back, being: plain, will not admit
of shrinkages, and being without trim
ming it displays its wornout marks with
startling distinctness.
But the clever modistes have found a
way to fix over the habit back, and the
summer woman can avail herself of it,
thereby bringing herself into possession
of one of the prettiest gowns of the year.
Suppose the gown is a navy blue zibe
line. or suppose it is a tobacco brown
veiling, or suppose it to be & gray sown,
either cloth or silk. The skirt Is habit
back, smooths perfect in fit. but out of
order from the fact that It is shabby.
The only thing now for the woman who
wants a new gown is to purchase some
taffeta to exactly match the goods. Then
let her rip the skirt down ths middle of
the back and lay a box plait of taffeta
across the opening. Or she can make two
plaits and lay them side by side down
the middle of the back. This gives her a
very new and entirely up-to-date gown
and one that will have a very chio ap
pearance.
A good dressmaker will take the skirt
that has gone a little to seed and will
trim It very prettily with narrow bands
of ribbon, put on so that they rise a little
at the back, but dip in the front These
bands of ribbon, if tastefully arranged,
will simulate a Spanish flounce and make
a very neat looking skirt, especially if
the material be a thin goods.
The summer lawns, the organdlea. the
zibellnes. the canvases and all the thin
summer goods are made extremely pretty
by the application of small Oriental fig
ures, done in embroidery. Little embroid
ered designs In every color under the sun
are pressed flat Into the goods and caught
by Invisible stitches. . Now, with clever
fingers, the summer woman goes over the
whole with a running embroidery stitch,
connecting the figures with long, graceful
designs. *
It is a season for the woman who
knows how to use her needle, and all
things can be decorated with this tin/ do
mestic weapon. From the tops of gloves,
which must be embroidered In tiny flow
ers, to the Insteps of stockings, which are
picked out with embroidery designs, there
are pretty possibilities for the woman
who knows how to stitch.
The beau-catching girl mast not forget
the value of the flounce, for, worn around
the foot of the summer gown. It is one of
the most attractive features
of dress. A scant lace flounce,
very deep, and slightly em
broidered so as to show the
design plainly. Is as charming
an article of dress as could
be found In the summer ward
robe. . Xor need the flounce ba
an expensive one. for with the
imitation laces there are soma
lovely things which cost so
little that the summer woman
can surely manage to have a
flounce or two In her rammer
trunk.

arf adept at. the tying. She must learn
the secret of the fonr-ln-hand knot and
how to apply it to her belt ribbon; and
Bhe must become past grand mistress of
the ribbon knot bow, with four loops and
only two ends.
The wily summer girl, when she puts on
her beau-catching gown, will pin on her
belt and fasten it with an elegantly
showy pin, right in the middle of the
front. At the back of the belt she will
attach a ribbon bow in such a manner
that the ends of the loops and all will
hang down in the most perfect order. It
must be a "made" bow, and to complete
the deception, the beau-catching girl can
attach it to the back of her belt with a
very large pin made to look exactly like
a buckle.
Another style of belt Is one that Is pro
vided with jacket tabs. Wide coat tails,
or frills, looking exactly like those that
finish the empire coats, , are attached to
the belt and the whole Is then hooked
around the waist. The effect is precisely
as though a jacket were worn and the
girl of artistic tastes can make these
belts and put tails on them with the very
There is another artifice practiced by
the beau-catching girl, and this is even
a prettier one. She takes > i newest spec
imens of oriental embroidery and makes
herself a atock and a front "slat", of
them. V.Vv-i
To make a new stock take enough Ar
menian or Persian or Chinese embrpidery
to go around the neck. Finish it top and
bottom to look like a stock. Provide it
with hooks and eyes In the back of the
neck. Now take a strip of embroidery
long enough to go from the chin to the
belt and attach it to the under part of
the stock. This makes the Oriental "slat"
and it is a thing in great vogue this sum
mer, though not. entirely a new idea.
Little Oriental Ideas.
The note of novelty is, lV>wever. given
to It by the use of the coral pins which
are employed to fasten it to the waist
at each side. A dozen tiny flowers of pal
est pink coral are used and at the throat
there is a larger pin, also of pink coral.
Another oriental set has two slats, one
in the middle of the front and one In the
middle of the back; but. In adjusting
best results. Frequently these wide tabs,
which extend almost all the way around
the hips, are embroidered, and then the
effect Is even better. ' , ; .
Innocent Little Deceptions.
And there are a great many innoccn*
little deceptions practiced by the beau
catching girl, deceptions which are so
good to look upon that one likes to be de
ceived by. them. \ . ','V
In the front ranks of summer deceptions
comes the newest undersleeve, which is
only a puff of chiffon with a very narrow
band of elastic run in the puff at the top
and bottom. This puff can be made of
lawn If preferred, or of organdie, or of :
any of the thin summer stuffs. It can
also be made of loulsine and of taffetaâ
Indeed anything can 1 be used, in old or
new material. v < v â¢
The special mission of this undersleeve,
which la i nothing more nor less than a
puff,' is" to provider finish for the elbow
'sleeve. It, Is slipped on the arm in suoh
a way that U ; covers ' the ' elbow. The
.waist with its elbow sleeve is then put
on> SJHmJBfjjf^-' 'Â¦Â¦ - '
This very simple style of. undersleeve is
one that is now being made. by all the Â¦
French modistes and,, in making it, they
make not one pair of undersleeves, but "
half a dozen to go with every : gown,' But :
this is a matter which the nimble ', fin
gered summer girl can decide for herself,
for the making of such a sleeve is so very
simple as to need no teaching and to
take very little ttm*. Â¦ Â¦Â¦ i '
these, it certainly does require the assist
ance of a maid, for the slats must set
straight or the appearance is utterly
spoiled.
. The beau-catching girl who- is not too
fat, can employ a pretty little method for
finishing her sleeves. And it is' one that
Is best adapted to a sleeve that is half
worn out. making it look like new again.
Take, for tne sake of an example, an
old shirt waist suit of dotted percale and
imagine that it has gone to the wash tub
once too often.. It is ironed shiny in some
spots and rough in others and here and'
there In the goods there is a suspicious
looking place as though it were going to
be a hole. L Â¦ Â¦Â¦- '^,r'iXi'- - - :
Take such a dress and make for the
wriata a little ruffle of cream colored

must be a' beU'to match 'the ruffles and

BY AUGUSTA PEESCOTT.
THE beau-catching girl is in our
midst. And these are the marks by
which you shall know her:
I She wears a beau-catching gown.
A She wears a flower hat.
Her belt Is gay and there is a ribbon
bow attached to it in the back to look
exactly like a cash. j '
She carries a parasol of seductive hue,
either severely plain or much berufiled
'and be frilled.
Her parasol handle shows the head of
an BTilmai.
Her favorite color is color-of-rose.
There are ribbon bows, ribbon choux
and ribbon trimmings upon her gown.
Her ribbons are striped or are combina
tion ribbons, two or three kinds being used
in one bow, or knot, or chou, whichever
you may chance to call it.
Her drees fastens invisibly in the front
or visibly in the back.
And around her shoulders there ii a be
wildering little cape or collarette of lace. ,
Such is the bean-catching girl and such
are her most distinguishing characteris
tics of dress. But there are others, quite
enough to make her the most bewildering
of all In the collection of summer girls.
Tet It must not be thought that the
beau-catching girl deliberately goes ouW
to captivate a beau, for this is not thi*
case. But both she' and her rown are
built that way, and It fls not her fault
that the summer beau falls a willing vic
tim to her charms and to the charms of
her gown.
The most distinguishing feature of her '
dresses is that they are fluffy and frilly.
They are very light in weight or at least ;
very light in texture, and there is a
transparent effect about them that Is fa*- i
dnatlng. :
The transparent materials of all kinds
â¢re mere in vogue than ever and to assist â¢
the summer girl In her search for trans- .
parent materials there comÂ© all the laces
which are cheap and pretty and entirely
charming from every point of view, as
well as all the lovely summer zibeUnis
and canvases.
Spots and figured Oesigns.
If you were to cfosely examin? the new
est of the beau-catching gowns you
would notice that they enow a tendency
to spots and figures. The raindrop Is
seen either In the same color or In a con
trasting hue, and there aie a great many
other little figures which are also used.
Materials, Instead of being plain, have
a llttl" fijrure raised upon them, or de
pressed Into them, and tiny flowers are
woven into the surface of more than one
nice fabric.
Materials with a very tiny figure are
really the best for the beau-catching girl,
for they are, more attractive. The figure
can bÂ« of tha same color as the back
ground, and can be carried out In a tiny
satin or silk lace effect, or It can be a
little embroidered figure.
Any of the small designs are good, and
the girl who can make up -er own gowns
can even at this late day add a little
gown of figured stuff to very good advan
tage, for it will be so very fashionable all
the soring and falL
Moreover, a dotted material is easier to
make up than a plain one, for it requires
less skill in the fitting and a great deal
less care in the finish. It needs no other
trimming besides itself and when done
there Is a certain pretty dressiness at
tached to It.
One 'of Miss Alice Roosevelt's most
fetching summer gowns is. a rose colored
dotted lawn, with dots also in rose. The
skirt is trimmed with a very deep flounce,
which comes half way up to the belt.
The flounce, though deep, is a scanty one,
Â¦with narrow bands of; very Inexpensive
lace set Into it. There. Is a hip yoke of
the ea mo kind of lace. The waist is a
plain little rose colored blouse, with a
little white lace fichu tied around the
shoulders. % . .. ,..:;.-Â¦.
The Tying of the Sash.
By way of color the dotted white gown,
or the dotted pink one. may have a bright
sashâ and, Indeed, the rammer sash Is one
of thÂ© very necessary features of dress.
The popular color for the sash is rose, but '
they wear sashes of striped ribbon and
sashes of bluish green, mixed with pink,
and sÂ»*heÂ« of black and yel{ow and blue
all combined in the most chic Frencby
fashion.
The t^ngr of the cash is something upon

Men and animals walking, angle toward

termed diaphragms or stops, the use of
which is to increase or diminish, the
amount of light entering the camera in
order to secure a sharper image upon the
ground glass and consequently 'upon the
negative. For instance: if the day Is
bright and sunny and you. wish to tako
$. time exposure, you may with advantage
stop your lens down to Nos. 32 or 64 dia
phjragm; but should the day be dark and
cloudy, you can Increase the light on. your
negative by using stop No. 4 or No. 8.
Do not forget Â¦ that the higher the num

hence, if you allow an exposure of 1-10

"stop down" the lens, the sharper will
be the details in your picture. .
Hundreds of tables have been compiled,
dozens of ideas expounded, and many In

complicated. I fear that so much Intri

from the desired result than a simple

nifying glass upon the ground glass.
Should the Image reflected upon the
glass be too large, move the camera back
from the view or sitter until the desired
proportions appear. If, on th'e contrary,
the picture Is too small, advance the
camera toward the subject. With Judg
ment and practice you will soon learn to
do this instinctively. Never, strive to
obtain a picture too large for your plate.
Should you wish a photograph of greater
size, any photographer will, 1 at a small
cost, make an enlarged print from your
email negative. You are doubtless aware
by this time that all images reflected upon
the ground glass of the camera appear
Inverted.
There are lenses manufactured known
and designated as long and short focus,
wide angle, etc. The uses of the above
lenses are apparent; should one desire to
make a photograph of a landscape with
great depth of scenery, the long focus
lens should be used; or, should one wish
to embody a great amount of detail in the
limits of a negative plateâ such as large
buildings, or the interior of roomsâ the
wide angle lens should be employed. The
latter lens Is also very desirable for group

your picture, whether of figure, building
or landscape, if it is a time exposure

the model remains quiet, her hair, as well
as the fan and handkerchief, have been
moved by the wind; hence the picture,
correct In other respects, such as focus-
Ing and posing. Is worthless as a speci
men of goqd photography.
Should the making of a picture under
this disadvantage prove unavoidable, open
the stop of your lens to No. 4 or 8. and if
the light Is powerful enough, give the
plate an instantaneous exposure and the
result will be satisfactory.
I have seen many curious effects of ex
posures made under similar conditions.
One was the picture of a dog, whose
master, while coaxing him to be quiet,
used such caressing tones and expressions
that Fido's sensitive spirit was raised to
the seventh heaven of beatitude, and
while* his body posed obediently to bis
master's behest, his tail Involuntarily
kept up a constant and lively expression
of delight The photograph was a time
exposure, 'and the consequence was a
portrait of a canine with the unfurled
tall of a full fledged peacock.
It is not difficult to suit your class of
subjects to the day. -Should you desire
to make time exposures In which trees
and forests are the prominent features,
then select the day that, is calm and
mild; 'but. if the scenes are at the sea
shore,-and your subject Is a yacht at full
speed, it adds to the effect to have the
wind at its best, and for this picture an
instantaneous exposure must be made.

THE WIND IS BLOWING.
This fault Is easily avoided. Place your
camera at such a distance from your sub
ject that the figures will be correctly pro

The beginner frequently makes the mis
take of placing his camera so close to the
person or object to be photographed that
his subject will more than nil the plate
and the result Is sometimes a grotesque
appearanceâ the head or a portion of the
body of the sitter being cut off. as in plate

with this before he branches into the un

his information as to the correctness ot
Impressions upon the small view finder at
the side of the kodak.
This effect Is most commonly the re
sult of carelessness In the use of the fo
cusing scale of feet placed upon closed
cameras provided with roll films, as ko
daks. These Instruments are without the
focusing ground glass. As an Illustra
tion of this fact, suppose you have pur
chased a No. 5 cartridge kodak with a
roll of films. Now the distance between
your subject and the lens If less than 100
feet must be measured. If the object to
be photographed is ten feet distant and
the pointer on the focused scale marks
twenty feet, the result will bÂ« a negative
such as that from which Plate No. Â« 13

versal focus for distances greater than 100
feet. In using this Instrument calculate
as closely as possible the distance la feet
between your subject and the lens; then
set the pointer to correspond wltli tats
number upon the focusing scale. X have
known an amateur to have more than
thirty exposures to turn out total failures
because she neglected to take advantage,
of this assistance In focusing. Again I
have known several Instances of ama
teurs not using the focusing rack at ail

cause they did not know that It was
necessary. I would, however, advise thÂ»
beginner to use a camera provided with
the ground glass until his eyes become
accustomed to judging distances and fo

To gain experience In this Us* It wonld
be well to measure off distances of six,

Impress their relative appearance* upon
the mind.
This practice will prove very helpful la
many photographic emergencies.
If the view to be portrayed Is. say, a
ravine, perhaps a. mile or more In depth,
you should focus upon some object in thÂ«
center of the landscape. Close your lens
down to a No. 16 or No. 32 stop, and you
will secure the extreme as well as thÂ»

WHY MY PHOTOGRAPHS ARE BADTHE SUNDAY CALL,

CUP BUTTON HOSTS
FROM the tirst settlement of Cali
fornia by the Americans the gal
lant wearers of the buttonsâ both
army and navyâ have been prom
inent features in the life of San
Francisco. 'Even some of the principal
streets are named for them, such as
Montgomery, Dupont, Jackson, Washing
ton. Fremont, Grant avenue, etc. But it
Is perhaps as hosts that the majority of
them are remembered In our midst, and
their parties have been of every imagin
able kind, including balls, dances, lunch
eons, picnics by sea and land, afternoon
receptions afloat and ashore,- garden par
ties and weddings; and when not actually
figuring as entertainers themselves they
have proved the motive for some very
elaborate functions at the hands of our
city fathers and other dwellers within the
State. The Presidio was almost as famous
for good cheer in the o'd days as it Is at
present. There were fewer dances, but
more breakfasts and luncheons given by
the officers to small parties of friends.
The first dance of any importance which
attained the dignity of a ball was given
May 2. 1S59, in celebration of the tenth
anniversary of the establishment of the
post. Mrs. C. C. Keer.eyâ afterward Mrs.
William Alvordâ who died on May 23
last, received the guests for the of
ficers, among whom were Major after
ward General E. D. Keyes. Lieutenant
afterward Adjutant General of the Army
H. G. Gibson. Lieutenant r terward Gen
eral J. B. McPherson, killed during the
Civil War; Lieutenant G. W. Custis Lee,
afterward a Confederate officer; Lieuten
ant afterward General George HÂ» Elliott,
Capta'in afterward Brigadier General
Simpson, Surgeon C. C. Keeney, etc.
A very popular coupie were Colonel and
Mrs. Thomas Swords, who were here for
several years about the close of the it's.
Colonel Swords was chief quartermaster
r.f the Department of California, and they
were the recipients of many social hospi
talities, which they were anxious to re
turn, but living at a hotel were Tn doubt
how it could be done.
Finally Admiral (then captain) Alden,
vho was always ready for such affair*--,
offered Mrs. Swotds the United States
purveying steamer Active for an excur
sion on the bay, which was promptly ac
cfpted. As the day fixed for the party
was one of great beautyâ as October day?
hereabouts usually are â the affair proved
a delightful one. Mrs. Swords had pro
vided a band of music for dancing, which
was indulged In vigorously while the
iteamer made a tour around the bay,
coming to a stop off Sausa'.Ito while an
elaborate luncheon was served. Then
. (here was more dancing while the steam
er made a run up the bay to Mare Island
before the pleasant day came to an end
The following year Colonel and Mrs.
Bwords supplemented this with a ball
given at the residence of JJIshop Kip, on
Rincon Hill, where th" Swords resided
Curing the absence of the Bishop's fam-
Uy in Europe. This was one of much
brilliancy, for owing to the presence of a
British man-of-war (flagship) In port
:he admiral and his officers, who were
i among -Mrs. Swords' guests, and those of
t|e United States service all wore their
uniforms, and the black coats were decid
edly in the minority.
The military ball which has been most
; widely known to fame was undoubtedly
j the one given by General and Mrs. Mc-
Dowell at the Occidental in January. 1865.
for not alone was It extensively written
up by the daily press, but It wp.p immor
talized in John F. Swift's novel, "Robert
Greathouse." where McDowell figured
under the name of General Chalnshot.
The ball was given about the close of the
war and did much to smooth the strained
relations and promote a kindlier feeling
between those whose leanings v."?re de
cidedly North and South, as was f.o large
ly the case at that tlmÂ«. General Mc-
Dowell was exceedingly fond of having
people about him and giving the young
folks a good ume, and to him may be
awarded the credit of the first garden
parties in San Francisco. To be sure,
they were simple affairs, diamonds In the
rough, so to SDeak, but they were very
pleasant. The grounds at Black Point,
now known as Fort Mason, were then
(the middle sixties) very uncultivated, but
there was always a good military band
in attendance and a large unfurnished,
uncarpeted room to dance in, and the
refreshments were usual y S3ndwl;-h<8 and
lemonade. These' were given the first
Thursday afterno<ni of every month and
were sometimesipreceded by^a review at
the Presidio in honor of some visiting
notable, like H. R. H. le Due de Pen
thievre in 1S66 and Governor Kennedy of
British Columbia the following year.
During General McDowell's, second sta
tion on the coast Black Point was a'gain
the scene of merry - parties, notably in
1SS0, when he there entertained President
Hayes, and in October t 1SS2, he gave a
large lÂ«all there a? a sort of adfeu just
prior to his retirement from active ser
vice. This was followed by a reception
given him on that event becoming an ac
complished fact. It took place October
14. at the Occidental, when his hosts were
the officers, of the army then stationed
here.
Next In the line of army garden part'es
were those given by General and Mr?.
Kautz, at Ansel Island, in 18S1 and 1882.
where on Saturda'y afternoons their
friends always enjoyed a couple of hours'
dancing. General Schofleld. who succeed
ed General McDowell, was also a frequent
entertainer at Black Point, and among
others the garden parties were especially
notable.
It was In ,1866 that General H. W. Hal
leck returned here to take command of
this department. The Hallecks had re
sided here before the .Civil War broke out
and had a very handsome home on what
was then railed fSecond Street Hill, just
above Folsom street. Here they again
took up their abode. 'announcing their In
tention of making it very gay.^and Mrs.
Halleck in the month of April opened the
programme by giving a large ball, fol
lowed by a series of receptions, at which
all the world and his wife appeared. Mrs
Halleck was asslsteu at these receptions
by the lovely wives of her husband's two
a!ds. Captain H. A. Huntingtcn and Col
onel R. M. Scott, and as Mrs. Halleck
was herre f a veiy handsome wjir.an. with
Mrs. Huiitir.gtou and Mrs. Scott a trio of
more beautiful women it would have been
difficult to rind.
A button beau who probably ereited
more stir in our midst than any before or
since was Brigadier General Charlts A.
Whittier. who cut a wide swath in our
social world in IS16, when he came to the
ctast upon Gtneial Hallecks staff, lie
was youthful looking In the extreme to be
a general and he was soon dubbed by
the fair sex "the Infant brigadier." Whit
tier was In great demand at every kind of
function, from the small .dinner to the
giand ball, and he returned these hospi
talities by giving a couple of yachting
parties on the bay on the pilot boat Gush
ing. However, on the second one the
party was becalmed near the Heads,
*here they were forced to spend the
night in a dense bank o'f foj. so this form
of pleasure seeking was abandoned ntim
con.
But our button hosts were by no means
confined to the army; the navy surely
has divided the honors fairly from a very
early period, commencing with Captain
Alden, who was in command of the sur
veying steamer Active. He and his suc
cessor, Captain Richard M. Cuyler, were
both men who were fond of society and
gay frolics and never lost a chance of
having one on board the vessel. Captain
Alden had his wife with him and she.
making her home on the Active, had
many luncheons on board. Cuyler was a
bachelor, but that did not prevent his fol
lowing in hi* predecessor's footsteps. He
gave .frequent moonlight rowinr parties
on the bay and when the Active went
anywhere on short trips he always took
a jolly crowd with him.' Admiral Bell
then called flag officerâ gave a series of
luncheons on board the Lancaster when
it first appeared in these waters early In
the sixties, and among his officers was
Lieutenant W. Scott Schley, who, as Ad
miral Schley, has recently so extensively
figured before the public. Another Df the
officers " of this period was Paymaster
Pelham Ames, now so well known as the
father of our present society beau,
"Worthy." '
The first naval ball on board ship In our
ha'bor was given on the frigate Lancas
ter, which was under command of Cap
tain E. P. McCrea, by the wardroom offi
cers in June, 1865. The decks were can
vased in, lighted with lanterns and can
dles and prettily decorated, and as the
Lancaster's band was one of much ex
cellence, the dance was a delightful onÂ».
This was followed a month later by a
subscription ball given at the Occidental
Hotel to Admiral Pearson and his officers
by those who had been iffvlted to the ball
on board ship and proved a charming one.
The next naval ball In the bay took place
on board the United States steamer
Vanderbllt in October, 1866, but^as the
night was inclement it did not. prove so
successful as the other. The officers of
the Pensacola, whicn succeeded the Lan
caster as flagship, gave a series of after
noon dances on board, but did not at
tempt any evening entertainments. It was
about this time that Lieutenant Com
mander dishing, the hero of the Aibe
marle, gave a yachting party in honor of
Miss Ella Maxwell, to whom he was very
devoted. She was the reigning beauty and
belle of the day and one of the trio known
as "the three Macks." who figured during
the early sixty decade, the other two be
ing Miss Mollie McMullin and Miss Jlc~'
Nulty. ;.
How many. are there* remaining who
can recall the ball given on board II. B.
M. Zealous In July, 1870, followed by a
long series of weekly afternoon dances
on that man-of-war while It was In port
duiing the time of the Franco-German
war. The bail given by the young gen
tlemen of the city at Pacific Hall, over
the old California Theater, to Admiral
Farquhar and his officers as a slight re
turn for their many hospitalities is still
talked of as something to date from. A
more hospitable place than the navy yard
at Mare Island cannot easily be found;
dinners and dances among the resi
dents are always taking place, and large
balls have been given there since the
Island was first occupied as a naval sta
tion. One of the first notable affairs was
an afternoon dance given by .Captain
Philip Fendtil of the Marine Corps to in
augurate the new marine barracks. To
this the guests came up by the regular
daily steamer from town, returning the
same way, but at the balls and recep
tions given by some of the men-of-war
there for a time, or on the arrival of
some new commandant, the dances take
place in the large sail loft, and the
guests from the city are brought up on
a specially chartered steamer, as^ for
instance the ball given to Commodore
and Mrs. Phelps In February, 1831, which
was a remarkably handsome affair, but
that is only one out of many..
It is not alone as hosts themselves that
the button-wearers have been promi
nent, but some of the most brilliant en
tertainments ever given in these parts
have been to do honor to those high in
rank of both army and navy, foreign and
national. The of 1863 was es
peclally v noted for two functions the
brilliancy of which has never been ex
ceeded. One was the ball given by our
Spanish residents in honor of the Span
ish Admiral Pinzon and the officers of bis
squadronâ this by the way was the first
of that nationality which had visited this
port since California became part of 'the
United States. At the ball there were no
less than five .admirals and their officers
present â the Spanish, Russian, French.
English and United States, and, as they
all appeared in uniform, the display of
buttons and gold lace was truly dazzling.
This ball was given at Platt's Hall, wherÂ«
the Mills building now stands, on tho
evening of October 16, 1863. Those on the
committee of reception â¢ were Camilla
Martin, F. San Jurjo, Henry Tricou, Tib
urdo Parrott, Henry Schmledell, H. Toler
Booraem, Fred Macondray, W. C*. Little,
Ed Pinnix, J. Foard and P. Garvey.
More important .probably and on â¢
grander scale, but hardly more brilliant*
was the ball given by the city to the
Russian Admiral Popoff and the officers
of his fleet at Union Hall just a month
later, November 17, 1863. Platt's was a
dark hall and difficult to light up, as a
consequence the ladies' costumes did not
show to advantage. This could not ba
said of Union Hall, which could be made
almost as bright as day. Flowers and fo
liage were not in . those days so much
used for decorating large halls as now,
the national colors were deemed sufficient
and almost solely put to use. But on this
occasion something quite novel was at
tempted and proved very effective. On
both sides of the hall, which was an im
mense one, pillars and arches were erect
ed and wreathed around with green vines;
from the of each arch was sus
pended a gilt cage containing birds
which tried to drown the music of tha
band with their sweet notes. Then tbere
were portaits of the Russian Emperor'
and Empress and George Washington
and large allegorical pictures surrounded
by sheaves of wheat and corn, wreaths
and mottos, so that on the> whole It was,
up to that time, the most lavishly deco
rated ballroom San Francisco had evei
seen. All the civic notables, foreign ConÂ«
suls, army and navy officers, were among
the guests and the following gentlemen
constituted the committee of arrange
ments-: Governor F. F. Low, Judge Og
den Hoffman, Brigadier General Wright,'
U. 8. A.; Admiral Bell, U. S. N.; Generall
L. II. Allen, Colonel C. L. Taylor, Major]

eral Grant was the hero to whom Sena*
tor Sharon did honor in ' October, 1879.
Kalston always did everything in a most
princely style. Carriages called for thÂ«
guests In town to take them to tho spe
cial train which con\ r eyed them to Bel
mon't; there they found the entire house
thrown open, a superb band of music to
dance to and a magnificent supper. Whlla
Ral3ton's balls were smaller In size and
decidedly more enjoyable, the Sharon-
Grant ball was a gorgeous affair and
more of a semi-public character as all
political gatherings must naturally be.
General Sherman and General Schofleld
were Joint guests of honor pt a ball given
by the city in the dining-room of the
Lick House a couple of weeks after the
Ralston ' entertainment September 15,
1S70.

The Marttan laugh Is of a broad and
hearse variety, starting in very loud and
ending suddenly in the same p'tch, with
a repetition of the hoarseness, with
scarcely any expression. The owner of a
Martian laugh has a bold and fearless na
ture, always defiant, and with (he saving
grace ot being eager to take up the cud

laughter is usually masculine) likes to
take the lead In everything, if not by per

stump speakers this expression of merri

It is accompanied by a love of opposi

arguments of all kinds. While thorough-

others, a person of this type would scorn

susceptibility to llattery. combined with
a strong desire not to be crossed in any

laugh Is characterized by a certain firm
ness which' expresses Itself In & middling

may be said to resemble slightly that ot
Jupiter and Luna, because of Its thought

though he may be Ignorant of the causa
for It. The Jupiter laugh is broad, mu
sical and lasting; it begins in a loud tone,
though far from being boisterous, and
finishes in a slow diminisMng of volume.
This laugh indicates a bold, fearless and
ambitious nature, full of pride and force
of character, which combination of qual
ities almost inevitably lead to a success

be found to be owners of, Jupiterian emo

with judgment and practicality sufficient
to steer them on their successful career
and avoid the rocks. Owing to their un
usual strength of character thia type dis
plays few really bad habits, while they
possess the pride and ambition to make
them excellent providers for the home.
The only way to appeal to persons of this
character is by reasoning or through
their sympathies when they are thor
oughly convinced that the subject 1m
worthy.,' The Lunarian laugh begins at
a high pitch and ends in a low, mellow
tone, often ascending again with a gentlÂ«
slur as its volume and tone increase. It
Is full of grace and has a dreamy ef
fect, which is attractive to the listener.
The Lunarian laugh means an Intensely
imaginative nature, and ofteneat Is found
among poets and. authore.
Shakespeare, Longfellow, Burns. Tenny

have possessed such a laugh. The Lun
arians live in the clouds rather than on
earth. They are inventors, though not
financially successful ones. When a per
son possesses this laugh to excess the
imaginative nature take:) on a melancholy
tone. He or she loves to roam in se
cluded places where admiration and
thoughts of nature may revel undisturbed.

nature, they are good livers, fastidious

flattery and pra'.se are the surest roads.
Full, hearty and cheerful is the Jupiter

this type and the laugher shakes excess

type possesses redeeming qualities in its
sensitiveness, but this is very apt to de

the perfection of any undertaking- These
persons work better mentally than phy

been received asking the most minute
questions about the career and mere par
ticularly the personnel or this talented
artist and his method of working.
: J. Ross Bry son Â¦> is a comparatively
young' man and a Canadian by birth; hav
ing been born near Montreal of very well
to-do Scotch parents. Ills future was as
sured, but at an early age he was appren
ticed to a firm of decorative painters, but
the mystery of this broad world beyond
his vision attracted him, and he Jour-,
neyed into the Rocky Mountains In search
of adventure and scenes to tempt Â¦ his
brush v Later he returned to Chicago and
began to study in real earnest before ha
opened a studio - in Â¦ Minneapolis just , for
the sake of the artistic atmosphere. / :
.Then, in 1894, the lure of the : world got
into his blood again and he was off for
Europe to study the great masters at flrst

Ballet dancers with their flimy draperies
and dainty poses particularly fascinated
him, and he soon won wide popularity for
the skill and. delicacy of his treatment of
these pictures.

childhood to womanhood has a deeper
significance, because of her untried faith,
than any experience that may come to
her later. Other loves deep and holy may
stir the depths of her woman soul, but
the piquancy of novelty that makes its

her awakened soul with Its responsive
love that experience has not yet taught
her to repressâ all the beauty of love's
flrst welcome she will never know again
as a tender, confiding child. She accepts
her flrst love lesson with all a child's
faith, hopÂ© and love, and . never again
could she hear the same story with the

Not many months ago a charming lit"

five years' of married life. Ho was her

"Ill as I was." she said, "you cannot

such an experience so late in life, yet
there is a something awfully sweet and
pathetic underlying the sentiment that
appeals to every good woman.
And a first engagement ring!
1 wonder if anything ever gives a
woman such. unqualified delight as it? I
do not think the majority of women care
very much about the value of the ring:
it is the sentiment; but I do think that
a woman values an heirloom more than
another ring of several times the value.

When you come to think of tt. th

is not normal, and one-half the time not
reaily sane, although it would have l>cen
a dangerous business for any one to have
Insinuated such a condition In the days
when we were going through the con

We have frequently tried to define love,

time, because we were writing Tor a
newspaper, we thought we knew it all,
but the more we have since tried to an
alyze love the more have we been con

Love is a malady in the first place.
It Is a fever that Is sometimes followed
by a record-breaking shock and then an
awful chill, or the chill may get in the
first Innings. Anyhow, we shiver; and
shake, and quake all right, as long as
the paroxysm lasts as we never did iu
the ague of cur school days.
It is Insanity because we do things at

HTJKRAH, CHILDREN ! Tha world do move. Here is something
absolutely new in the puzzle-page line. How do you like the
changeF The strangest part of this puzzle page is to guess what
is going to happen next Sunday, isn't itP But these new Fairy Riddles
and Paint Pictures are the thing. Just look at the little old man and
the round-eyed, wondering little girl! Aren't they funnyP The whole
picture looks weird and spooky, doesn't itP But the secret of all this
is contained in those lines at the top of the picture. That's the riddle.
Read it:
"As I went through the garden gap, who should I meet but Dick Red
Cap;
Stick in his hand and a stone in his throat Tell me this riddle* and
111 give you a groat."
There! Can you guess what Dick Red Cap is? He is concealed in
many places, in that paint picture, though in one or two Instances he
lies out in pialn sight. If this riddle seems too difficult, just read the
6tory above about the way corks can be made to float vertically. That
teaches that "In Union There Is Strength." So apply the maxim to
your own mind and gather all your faculties together. With a union of
all your wits you can surely solve that riddle. And then just think of
the prizes! Ah, that will make you work!
i And now listen carefully. This is what you must do to win one of
those FIFTY PRIZES: After solving the Fairy Riddle printed in big
letters at the top of the picture below, find all the Dick Red Caps, out
line each in pencil or ink and then color with paints, inks, water colors
or crayons the whole Paint Picture as artistically as you can make it,

SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY NEW FOR 50 SPECIAL PRIZES
THE; SUNDAY CAJCiX*
OJCCE upon a time Christopher Columbus, who, if you remember your history well, discovered America, mads a very deep impression upon the wise men of King Ferdinand and Queea
Isabella's court, who did not believe that the world was round, as Columbus claimed, by showing them the simple- trick of making- an egg stand on end, after they had all tried
and failed. Of course, you all know that trick now. ;. Â¦â¢'.< >,.', ;"Â¦_-/';
â¢ â¢ Well, here is another trick that is peculiarly applicable to the solution of the brand-new Fairy Riddle and Paint Picture printed on the # lower half of this page. Bead
Tthis through to the very last line and you will quickly see how this famous motto of Uncle Sam's will help you. The trick, which will afford you very much amusement at: the same
time, is how to make corks float vertically. Of course, you know that vertically means straight up and down. . -..."-'!
A wash basin or a bathtub and seven corks are all the apparatus needed for this experiment, and it will, I hope, be none the less interesting on account of Its sim
plicity. The problem is, then, how to cause these corks to float vertically. Everybody knows that an ordinary cork, being considerably longer than it is broad, is forced to float, when
put in water, upon its long side. How can we make it float upon its head?
Place one of the corks on end on the table; surround it with the other six, all upon end; take these seven corks compactly in one hand and plunge them under water, so
as to moisten them completely. Remove your hand and -let 'them take jtheir own position in the water. The water that has penetrated the corks will cause them to ding together,
because their united width is greater than their length. ':"... *â¢â¢'Â¦"* â¢KffJ,- .

#~^ none among you, you say? \ Of ' course -there isn't. Every child nowadays knows as much, if not
more, than his elders about America's splendid navy. /That being the case/ here v is an unsurpassed op
Â»pbrtunity to get one of those exciting Nay^^War Games,, a Bathing Suit, a Baseball Mask, a Wrist
Purse a Gold-Filled Horseshoe Brooch or any)of those other valuable prizes enumerated in this list be

" And, : by the way, thosa ten pictures do look a littie^bit out of the ordinary, don't they? Well,
they are not quite like any of those that have been printed before, but, 'b?st of all, they are easier.to
guess. Just try. and see. , Begin with No: 1, for instance. ; Now v what sort of % a warship in Uncle Sam's
navy do you think couldbe represented by such' a quaint, old-fAshioned tub of a boat as an arkâ the
sort of ark that Noah made famous for all time?. Do you, remember about Noah and how, when the rain
came, he built abrand-new ark? But this is telling. But that pig running through the letter 0 with an
excited chick on~ his backâ now what battleship} do you 'think could possibly be represented in a picture
like that?/Ah! Too easy, wasn't it? Well, you can tty the rest yourself.
â¢ . Remember, each.of the ten pictures in this, the TENTH SET in the FOURTH SERIES of the Sun

PARTISAN CONDUCT

COMMON'KNOWLEDGE
/T is not proposed to make a detailed
statement -of * the. reasons which led
to the resignation of Professor. Ross,
or even detail tlie additional objections to
his conducted speeches, which /were ob
jected to chiefly ' because J they, were be
lieved* to be In violation of the university
truats. and purposes; but his violation of
rion-partlsa'nism , by taking .the public ros
trum'In'campaigns under the auspices of
partisan ; campaign committees and lend
ing! his -name and' official title for use on
partisan campaign pamphlets, gross in
language "Â¦ and 'illustration and objection
ablei ;ln't thernselves as evidently, designed
to appeal to the passions and prejudices,
is a 'matter 4 of^ common knowledge. Not
having had -any flxed'opinion myself upon
the Issues of. the r campaign of ,1896,. I did
riot -object .to .these acts because 'of "the
political views, ,. expressed, . nor did . I
change my, opinion of him or, cease to ex
press'it when Professor Ross subsequently
changed those views. ' â¢
\ ; In attempting to announce the reasons
of others which -led 'to his' enforced resig
nation. Professor Roes ' stated that it was
due - to' my objections K - to * two public
speeches;inthe spring of 1900. â¢
One of the speeches to which Professor
Ross . referred ' related .to Oriental.immi
gration and - was"., delivered â¢ in .a mass
meeting called' for the purpose of ' agitat

". "It has been * the history of universities
that'theirprofessors rarely take. the pub

very infrequency of their having done
so would seem to prove that there iÂ» some
sound reason why they should not."

WALL STREET EXCITED.
" NEW tORK. July 25.â To-day"* short
session of the Stock Exchange was fevcr-
In the room set apart for customers,
where a youth was busy changing quo
tations on a board against the side of the
wall, some of the older habitues seated
thernselves, perhaps out of force of haifit
and while- "watching the market." sat
and whispered of Wall street's lateat sen
sation. There was considerable epecula
tion among those as to Keene's individual
loss. He himself had admitted that it wag
n^00.000. and while some believe this
figure to be conservative, they hoped it
was true that his private^fortuno had not
been Impaired.
Brltt, the assignee, late in the after
noon, when seen In the Talbot J. Taylor
& Co. office, said:
"It Is impossible for me to give out any
statement to-day and It probably will be
several days before my statement is
ready. I figure the loans at about H,
000,000. Russell 8age Is creditor to a con
siderable amount, but Is fully secured." *
GUESSING AT THE LOSS.
James R. Keene hurried into his private
room in the office of his son-in-law in the
Johnston building at 9:30 o'clock this
morning. Early as Keene was. he found
Talbot J. Taylor and his brother and part
ner, James B. Taylor, and corps of clerks
busy over the books of accounts. When
the market opened the stock quotations
ticker in Keene's private room and the
other tickers in the public office of the
Taylors began to reel out the .opening
quotations. Keene stood at the side of
the machine in his room, with the paper
tape running through his fingers. HÂ« saw
what have been termed the "Keene'a
stocks" open with prices away below tho
closing figures of last night. The story,
as It spun out before him, was an In
teresting one to Keene, but he frequently
dropped the tape to walk over to the win
dow overlooking Exchange Place, where
he would stand for a moment to glance
thoughtfully across at the roof tops and
other office windows that perhaps he did
not see. Frequently he was In consulta
tion with Talbot J. Taylor, his son-in
law, or James B. Taylor. During the
short business hours the Taylors were
among their former customers, who came
in >to express their regrets at the firm's
embarrassment.
It Is the general opinion of those who
have weathered such storms in the past
that the present unpleasantness Is to bo
accounted for Just as was the great era
of prosperity. One was the result of
natural causes; the other came as a nat
ural consequence of the first. Few men
are now bold enough to discuss tho fu
ture for publication. All know that signs
count for little In such stress of financial
weather. He is a bold man who even fo;
his most intimate friends will venture a
prediction as to what the immediate fu
ture will bring forth. While- the general
tone is still optimistic and very few are
ready to believe that the crest of the
wave of prosperity has much more than
been broken, it Is held by many that
there must be a period of distress before
Wall street will settle into anything like
calm. It is the opinion of men who dis
cussed the situation to-day that the ex
haustion is temporary and that It does
not approach the lethargy which seized
the country about ten years ago.
Thus It may be seen that the storm that
has swept across tho financial district
and which may not as yet have reached
Its culmination, has spared few In select
ing its victims and it may be taken as
proved that It was of natural origin, hav
ing been formed of the purpose or will
of no combination of men.
CAUSE OF THE FLTJBSY.
John W. Gates and the other members
of the "Chicago crowd" are nursing a
wound that will be long - in hqalins.
James Keene admits the loss of $1,500,000.
Some believe TCeene's fortune has shrunk
much more. -
The apparent loss to friends of J. Pier
pont Morgan has been great. William C.
Whitney and those who are allied with
him have suffered reverses that have
hurt.
By conservative men in Wall street and
by men who most closely follow the
trend of affairs financial, the estimate is
made that the Rockefeller family fortune
has shrunk $100,000,000 in value under the
influence of the recent slump in securi
ties.
NEW YORK. July 25.â Wall street ex
perienced two hours of continued liquida
tion to-day, almost as violent as any that
has preceded it. To-night there is appre
hension of what the reckoning will be on
Monday. The prices of "Keene" stocks
and of numerous pooled and cliqued spe
cialties broke violently, clearly indicating
that others did not take the same calm
view of the situation as the great manip
ulator, who is "annoyed, but not' em
barrassed."

rO the Board of Trustees of the Ice
land Stanford Junior University-
Gentlemen: I have called you to
gether to-day that our highly esteemed
friend, Hon. Whitclaw Reid, who so kind
ly accepted my Invitation . to become a
trustee cf the Leland Stanford Junior
University, could meet you all in person,
as he is obliged to leave for his home
next week, and I desire to take advantage
of this meeting and his presence to lay
before you certain affairs which have
troubled my heart more than I am able
to express.
I wish .that the university should bo
turned over to your guidance and man
agement unspotted and without a blem
ish, no old wounds to heal, no troubles
left for you to settle for me. If I did I
would thereby declare my inability of car
rying out my views. I hope my ten years
of administration have shown a steadfast
purpose, and now that I am soon to give
up thÂ© management of the" affairs of the
university and you to assume the duties.
I do not wish to declare myself to have
been unequal to the situation by allowing
any troublesome affairs of the past to
remain in doubt or controversy. To this
end I am now about to reveal 'to you a
little inside history of affairs , with w.hich
my name has been associated, but which
has never been truthfully told. . As you
gentlemen will, I trust, long outlive me,/
,1 will inform you of the facts and. lay
before you the correspondence of; the
case and pray that you will make the
matter right if ever my stewardship is
questioned. My lips bo far have been
sealed by my own wish.
I allude particularly to the Ross mat-.

In my address to you of June 1, lS97,'ls
the following:' "Jn the"gfant founding' the

powers of the president- of ;the- university
have- -been exceptionally extensive. Â¦_ and
absolute. -'"'.Â¦
ter. The acceptance " of Professor Roes'
resignation took place during my absence
abroad, almost a year before 'my return,
and four years after I had formed and
expressed my views concerning his fitness
for the position he held. This fact made
certain misconceptions and misunder
standings possible which I wish ' to re
move from the minds of you trustees be
fore you assume your duties as custodians
of the university. , ..
The discussion incident to the resigna
tion of Professor ,Rbss and others pro
ceeded upon a distinct , misunderstanding
as to the powers I have voluntarily del
egated to the president of the university
and as to my attitude upon. tho question
of free speech. Â¦:Â¦:-Â¦'
Under the ' provisions of the .founding
grant and the act under which the uni
versity was founded all- the powers and
privileges of the trustees were vested in
the founders during their % lives. Â¦ The
founders, however, assumed only' those
powers relating to the management of
the .university, properties, .to. the , erection
and permanent : equipment -of Â¦ university
buildings and to the determination of the
gross amount of ;the ; annual appropria
tions for the maintenance of the Institu

tlon of the- university's stand. In the
recent course of turning over the manage
ment of the institution to the Board of
Trustees, Mrs. Stanford chose to take the
trustees into fullest confidence, submitting
to them all of the correspondence In the
case and embodying in this address an ex
position of her own part in the occur
rence.
Mrs. Stanford makes it plain that Dr.
Ross' retirement was not forced by her;
that whatever of displeasure she felt to
ward the head of the department of
sociology was not due to any attempt on
her part to curtail freedom of speech, but
was aroused by Professor Ross' active
participation in partisan affairs and
proneness to express from the platform
sentiments which were, in Mrs.' Stan
ford's opinion, subversive . of law and
order; and that Stanford University pro
fessors have never suffered Interference
from the surviving founder, but have en
joyed complete freedom in investigation
and teaching.
The address follows in full:

About half an hour after the message

jÂ«sre came from Ilimrod. half way b<
tv.cn Westvllle and Danville, saying that
one of the miners, a Hungarian, had
been stopped there by citizens who took
from bUn a large quantity of dynamite.

SHEBIFF DEFENDS PRISONER.
The Sheriff and his deputies had expect
ed an attack and made a strong stand.
The Sheriff refused the dsmands for Wil
son and threatened to shoot if tho mob
committed an overt act. The mob, now
worked up to an intense state of excite
ment, became frenzied in its determina
tion to reach Wilson, ar.d m Its fury
threatened to lynch the Sheriff, his depu
ties and a negro turnkey. Finally they
< barged the jail and the Sheriff and his
deputies fired, wounding three members
of the mob, one fatally. The mob, being
repulsed, cent to a neighboring mining
< amp for dynamite and tnreatened to at
tack the Jail again.
Wilson, it Is charged, went to the Bur-
Bets farmhouse while Mrs. Burgess was
alone and begged food. While ehe was
petting him something to eat he seized
her. He fled, leaving her half dead. She
# managed to crawl to a neighboring farm
*house and pave the alarm. A posse of of
ticers Ftarted in pursuit of the negro and
when Wilson was captured he was hur
ried to the County Jail to prevent lynch
ing. There the negro confessed.
Company K. a colored troop, has its
headquarters here and the officials have
prepared to call It out. Leaders of the
mob declare they will kill the entire
<-..mpany if it comes out. On tho edges
of the square at midnight two unknown
negroes lay in the gutter. They were
beaten into insensibility with clubs in the
Ijauds of white citizens.
Nearly 200 men and women from Alvia,
*vhcrÂ© the attack on Mrs. Burgess was
â¢â¢omraltU'd, are active leaders of the mob.
The mob at midnight had been increased
to several thousand, the entire square in
front of the iail being packed with ubout
ing men and women. While waiting for
the miners who were expected to bring
the dynamite from Westvllle. the mob
march'.-d uÂ» and down in front of the jail,
: â¢?.(Â¦ning it and tiring shots at random.
â¢ On account of the overwhelming num
.bers cf the mob it was useless for the of
.flcero to resist. The negro was seized and
.rushed to the spot where he had shot
down Gatterman. It was the work of an
Instant to thfow a rope around his neck
and swing him up to a telephone pole.
After h!s life had been slowly strangled
out he was left hanging while the mob
proceeded to the County JaiL After going
a short distance, however, the mob
charged its mind, faced about and. re
turning- to the scene of the lynching, cut
Mayfield's body down. They rushed It to
the principal square, built a bonfire and
hacking the body to pieces with knives
pitched it in the midst of the flames. For
a while they watched it burn and then,
coming to a realization of thÂ«-lr first mis
sion, to lynch Wilson, they once mo^ re
sumed their march to the County Jail.
Henry Gattermaa. a young butcher, fell
inortally wounded and expired within a
few misntes. The negro fled, but was
caught by officers within a block of the
r-cener and hurried to the police station
with the mob in hot pursuit, temporarily
diverted from their march to tb^ county
Jail. The officers with their prisoner took
refuge in the city building and barricaded
themselves behind tha doors of one of

f f FiV no other 'institution are the principles of;, freedom of

thoroughly establisJied and safeguarded as they are. in; the

utterances of Dr. Ross, I zuasnot only exercising a sacred right,
which we have guaranteed to every one connected with the insti
tution, but I was speaking in defensc-of these very principles. No
one can appreciate more fully than I the right to freedom of
speech, for upon many occasions I have refrained icith the great
est possible effort from expressing my personal vieivs when I be
lieved serious errors were being made, lest it might', be thought
that I was attempting to impose those znews upon the university."

WHITT1ER. July fe:â The State Reform
School here was converted into a hospital
ye3terday and to-day by- reason of the
fact that more than .100 of the officers and
inmates were poisoned in a manner which
until to-night remained a' mystery.
The trouble began yesterday morning,
when a large number of the older boys
beVame suddenly 111, and the hospital of
the school being too email to accommo
date all of them the dormitories were con
verted-into hospitals and all the physi
cians available' were Bent for. Inasmuch
es the poisoning was confined to two com
panies of the" inmates and that the others
escaped It was at first supposed that some
poison had been placed in the food, and in
order to preveut a repetition of it the sup
ply of food was condemned and a new
supply ordered. Including everything
which Is kept in the larder.
To-day it , was positively, established
that the illness of the boys and officials of
the school was due to ptomaine poison
ing An -official statement, which was Is
sued to-night after a thorough Investiga

account. In view of the week's violent
llauldatlon. Is "considered nothing l^ss
than astounding. The pressure for credits
which could have produced such a result
might have been enormous, although It is
recognized that the situation of the banks
must be strengthened by the additional
collateral and the improvement In its
character which probably has been ex
acted. The bank statement was neverthe
less sufficient to make the closing in
stocks weak and there was late pressure
also upon. bonds. The convulsive contrac
tion in prices of many specialties was
recognized as being due in many cases
to closing out collateral for loans of the
failed firms and some of the stocks af
fected tonflrm the plaint of the prominent
operator connected with yesterday's prtn
cipal failure, that even Investment stocks
are unsalable in the present .market.
The fear has grown that the shrinkage
In securities values and the difficulties of.
the money market will themselves react
on the general situation and prompt the
abandonment of enterprises which are re
lied upon to keep up the demand for com
modities. Such a tendency is suggested
by the intimations, that various rallroaA
companies are modifying plans for better
ments, owing to the difficulty in obtaining
money. -

Remarkable Sequel Is Discovered to Story of Gaptaih
Thomas Howard's Fight for a. Fort:iineiin Alaslca; and
His Bloody End in the Midnight Hours in Berkeley
TO the story of the deep conspiracy
that lurks in the background of
tht mysterious death of Captain
Thomas Howard in West Berke
ley an Saturday, the 18th, investi
gation adds startling facts. The deed to
the 1600 acres of rich mining property in
the Klondike, which Captain Howard
trrasur*d as representing all his fortune,
has disappeared. When last seen by his
frjends Captain Howard had the docu
jnent on. his person; when found withuhia
head riddled with bullets there was not a
scrap of paper on him save a franked
ticket to Sausalito.. . .
As published exclusively in .The- Call
yesterday morning. Captain Howard had
been the victim of 'a scheme by New
York financier? to oust him from the pos
session of the rich concession of. mineral
lands oh Indian River, and he feared that
every day's 'absence from the Klondike,
m-as a menace' to Â¦ the safety of his for
tune. - â¢ i * '. ' . r ...
Though he had the c^ean title. 'to his
wealth tight In his hand. Captain How
ard had fought successfully against his'
defrauders for a. year. On Saturday, July
IS, he was found in a lonely suburb across
the bay with two bullet holes in his head.
The deed had dropped out of sight with
its owner. ._\--
PRECIOUS DEED MISSING.
J. B. Treancr, an insurance adjuster,
with offices at 501 Montgomery street, who
was a clo.-e friend and business associate
of Captain Howard, says that on Satur
day. July 11, Howard came to his office,
where the document confirming the Gov
ernment land grant was in safe keeping,
and took it out of the vault. At that time
Captain Howard said he would leave for
Victoria that night and desired to take
the deed. A week Â¦ later' his" body was
found in West Berkeley. -."./.-
Thorough search. - *f . tha*4e.ad man's pa-,
pers reveals no "trace of the deed.' There
is in. his folio-ft rough type writtea draft
of the original Government paper, which
Captain Howard waa -wont . to use merely
as reference, but. which bears no -- legal
authority. -â¢' : â¢ '
HOWAED'S MO VEMENTS.
j Captain Howard's former" associate,* J.
B. Treanor, sees suspicious circumstances
in the violent end "of Captain Howard
and the disappearance of the deed. He
says: - - . .,.:. - â¢. â¢ j
That Captain Howard has been foully mur
dered there Is no doubt. -The circumstantial
evidence of the motive Is. very grave. The
captain had told me that he had had a fight
for his title and felt that he must get back
to Alaska at the earlleit moment. He was
especially -careful of his deed from the Ot
tawa land- office, and kept it locked in ray
safe until July 11.
- On that day he said he was going to leave
for Victoria that night whence he was coins
to Alaska Immediately. He always carried' tbe
deed .when he -, traveled and so In th* - present
Instance he had It in his pocket when I said
good-by to him.
Over the week intervening between that
night when Captain Howard took leave
oi his friend and July 18, when his- body
was found in. West Berkeley,' there hangs
a veil of mystery as. deep. as that cloud
ing the truth of his terrible taking off.
He was not at his hotel in. this city, nor
at the home of Treanor : in Frultvale,
where he had formerly spent three
months. Not a clew to his movements
can be discovered.
It ha3 become reasonably certain that
the presence of Captain Howard in West
Berkeley on the day of his death was
prompted- by a desire to see Charles But
ters, the mining expert and capitalist.
William G. Henshaw," who had met Cap
tain Howard .through a letter of; intro
duction from a friend in Canada, had In
troduced him to the capitalist some time
in June. ;."
! In an effort' to .-Interest both . Charles
Butlers and hia brother ' William in his
project of developing his rich mineral
holdings in Alaska Captain' Howard had
paid seyeraJ visits ..to their respective
homes in Berkeley and Oakland... On. the
fatal '17th -of July, when Captain Howard
was seen at noontime by *C. E. Carman in
West Berkeley, he Inquired the', way to
East Berkeley. It Is probable .that he
was on his way to Charles Butters' homo
at 2C46 Telegraph, avenue, and had'ar
rived in West Berkeley through a mistake
in trains. "' " â¢ " ; â¢ Â¦
But Captain Howard's presence in West
Berkeley a week after he; waÂ« I supposed
to have departed for the' north is ; ren
dered inexplicable by the statement of
T. S. Cunningham of 1219 Jackson street.
He said yesterday:"
I was an old friend of Captain Howard,
and. having met him In the Klondike In 1902,
grew to be bo close to him in business affair*
that he told me most of his .plans. On July
10 I met him on -Montgomery street ' and ho
told tnÂ« then that he .waa expecting to. meet &
prominent mining engineer who was- to ar
rlvt from the East that night. He stld.that
In company with this, engineer he going
to 'leave, for 'Alaska, on. the. following night,
â¢topping off in "Victoria. "That was the last I
ever saw of him.- â¢ ...â¢â¢â¢.. .
The theory that Captain Howard waa
utterly lacking .in funds and hence
prompted to take, his own life ts refuted
by the statement of Treanor that he fur
nished his friend with money and also
by tho fact that among Captain How
ard's effects, were found. Wells-Fargo re
ceipts showing that on April 11 he for
warded $60 to a. Captain Edward Palmer
and orr July 4 and 6 deposited' $150 to hi*
own. credit." â¢ " Â¦:' Â¦' '."'Â¦Â¦
Dr. Hubert N. Rowell 'of Berkeley, the
surgeon who assisted in "the autopsy on
the dead man, scouts the. suicide theory.
He said last night:

the. status of Dr. -Jtoss in the. university
prior to the two speeches referred to l?y
him:
In no other institution are the principles
of freedom of speech, freedom of thought
and freedom of conscience so thoroughly
established and safeguarded ay they :ire
In the Leland Stanford Junior University.
In so far as I criticized the utterances of
Dr. Ross, - 1 was not only exercising a sa
cred right which we have guaranteed to
every one connected with the institution,
but I was speaking in defense of these
very principles. No one can appreciate
more fully than I the right to freedom of
speech, for upon many occasions I have
refrained with the greatest possible effort
from expressing my personal views when
I believed serious errors were being made,
lest it might be thought that I was at
tempting to impose those views upou the
university.
of free speech by Professor Ross*are ac
cordingly based upon alleged objections to
utterances which he claims never to have
made and to conduct of which he claims
not to have been guilty.
- v It. should 'have 'been evident to Profrs
sor Ross and every one else familiar with
my policy of refraining from imposing my
religious, political or sociological vi*wsÂ»
upon the university, however strong
those views might be, that if any error
was committed it must have arisen from
misinformation or mistake of fact, ami
not from wrong principle. Had I wlshiti
to impose any such vie* s -upon the uni
versity: I. could have done so, since the
p.vxcr to change the natiae. objects and
purposes of the institution was absolutely
vested in me by the founding grant and
the act under which the university was
founded.

Pleasing Feature of
the Farewell in
Dublin.
DUBLIN*, July 'J*.â Kin? Edward and
Queen A'-exandra left Dublin by train
shortly before noon to-day, accompanied
by Princess Victoria and their suites, on
their way to Newtownards, County Down,
to visit the Marquis of Londonderry at
his Mount Stewart residence. Notwith
standing the rain, the royal party drove
from the vice regal lodge in open car
riages and halted at Phoenix Park to
review thousands of school children, who
shrilly cheered. One of them passed a
bouquet to. the Queen. This was one of
the most touching features of the Dublin
reception, which throughout was remark
able for its enthusiasm and the entire
absence of unpleasantness. The route to
the railway station was packed by con
tinuously cheering people, who gave the
royal visitors a magnificent farewell.
A message from King Edward to the
Irish people, issued to-day, expresses deep
appreciation of the loyalty and affection
with which the Queen and King were
surrounded during their stay in Dublin,
and says the King trusts that in God's
providence the Irish may enjoy blessings
commensurate with the warmth of their
hearts. . -J
The royal train, drawn by an engine
decorated with earlands of flowers, ar
rived at Ncwtownarda without any note
worthy incident, .excepting that the coun
try people crowded every vantage â¢ point
along the line and cheered the passing
train. The town of Newtownarda was
gayly decorated and its streets were filled
by cheerinst crowds. The Marquis and
Marchioness of Londonderry and tho
county and municipal â¢ officers met the
King and Queen at the railway station
and the royal party drove to Mount Stew
art.
After the King left Dublin it was an
nounced that ho had donated $5002Lto the
poor of the city.

PUBLIC OWNERSHIP
/LECTURE IN OAKLAND
IS NOT CRITICIZED
THE other public speech referred to
by Professor Ross was on tho sub
ject, "The Twentieth Century
City."
Concerning these speeches, Professor
Ross made the following statement upon
his resignation:
"My coolie immigration speech is not my
sole effense. Last April I complied with
an invitation from the Unitarian church
of Oakland to' "lecture before them on
Tbe Twentieth Century City.' I address
ed myself almost wholly to questions of
city growth and. city health and touched
only incidentally on the matter of public
utilities. I pointed out, however, the
drift, both here and abroad, toward the
municipal ownership of water and gas
works and predicted that, as Regards
street i railways, American cities would
probably pass through a period of muni
cipal ownership and then revert to private
ownership under regulation. My remarks
were general in character and, of course,
I took no stand on local questions. - Only
months of special investigation could en
able me to -say. whether a particular, city
like or San Francisco could bet
ter itself by supplying its own water or
light. Yet this lecture was objected to."
How, then, could Professor Ross imag
ine that any one should object bo strongly
to his Oakland speech, because of the
views expressed, that it should constitute
a cause of dismissal? As street railways
are the only public utilities in which I
was interested, and that only as founder
of the university, how could he have
thought that J could have objected to his'
views against the success, of public own
ership of street railroads?
Dr. Ross either means that I criticized
his speech- because he believed- public
ownership of street railways would prove
to be a failure or because I opposed pri
vate ownership unfler public control, as
i3 the case of all other railroads under
.the Railroad Commission. Even if street
railroads and all other public, city util
ities are not now; subject to public 'con
trol, should the public wish to exercise It. 1
the experience, of the railroads under euch
control has been uniformly satisfactory
to them, as a reasonable Income is guar
anteed to them by law. . .
It is true, that this Oakland speech was
credibly represented 'â¢- as and believed ; to
be 1 of a partisan character and .that it
contained ( incendiary language, although
1 ii v&s never referred to by me until alter

"DAVID S. JORDAN.
The teaching of violence is in con
sistent with the Founding Grant, which
provides "The nature, object and purposes
of the institution hereby founded, to be;
â¢ â¢ â¢ its purposes to promote the
public welfare by exercising an influence
in behalf of humanity and civilization,
teaching the blessings of liberty regulated
by law, and inculcating love and rever
ence for the grfcat principles of govern
ment as derived from the inalienable
rights of man to life, liberty and the pur
suit of happiness."
Prom subsequent developments, I be
lieve neither President Jordan nor Pro
fessor Ross looked up the report in The
Call, but read a manuscript copy of the
address which, I have since been told,
did not contain the language referred to,
so that neither one seems to have known
or understood the special point of my
reference.
The account referred to consisted of but
a short paragraph and, in conclusion,
quoted Professor Ross as saying: "And
should the worst come to the word it
would be better for.us If we were to turn
our guns upon.evfery vesset bringing
Japanese to our shores rather than to per
mit them to land." I do not know what
Professor Ross meant, but he knew he was
addressing an assemblage composed large
ly of uneducated people not familiar with
the use of euch terms in any figurative
sense and many of whom bad doubtless
followed more than one leader, who, to
the shame and universal discredit of our
State and people, openly counseled the
solution of the Chinese problem by vio
lence and revolution rather than by legal
regulations. A person cannot complain
if he is misunderstood by reporters or
others in the use of incendiary or an
archistic language intended to havo ' a
slightly different meaning.
"My husband, as you know, was an
ardent partisan of the Republican party,
but never for one moment did he intend
or expect that the university would in any,
way favor Republicanism,^ Democracy,
any more than it would favor the
Catholic, Methodist or any other church.
"This movement, which has "but, just
commenced against the immigration of
Japanese; to our country, will, in. a few
months, have assumed very serious pro
portions. It is but a repetition of the old
prejudice against the Chinese, and a
repetition of 'Kearnylsm.' when a reign of
terror pervaded our city, and no one
knows of it better than I, for we had a
guard, armed, in our house to protect us,
and a squad of police surrounded our
house to prevent it from being burned.
At that time this said 'Kearny.* the leader 1
of it all. was sustained by just such car
actcrs; and within, two years after he,
with his followers, became the most ar
dent, devoted and~loyal friends to my hus
band; and in my presence eald that Mr.
Stanford's arguments had convinced him
that he had been an unjust
course."
"My dear friend and helper, I
prize so highly, while discussing this let
me say to you that when I take up a
paper, as I did yesterday morning's Call,
and read of the sayings of Professor Ross
at a political meeting (for it was noth
ing else) and realize that a professor of
the Iceland Stanford Jr. University, who
should prize the opportunities given him
to distinguish himself among his students
by the high and noble manner of his life
and teachings to them, thus steps aside
and out of his proper sphere' to asso
ciate himself with the political dema
gogues of San Francisco, exciting: their
evil passions and drawing distinctions be
tween man and manâ ai. laborers, and
equal in the sight of Godâ and literally
plays into the hands of the lowest and
vilest elements of socialism, I am grieved
to the depths of my heart.- I must con
fess I am weary of Professor Ros3 mix
ing in political affairs, and I think he
ought not to be retained at Stanford Uni
versity. He once before overstepped the
bounds of propriety. Stanford University
is .not a political machine; nor should
a professor of that college ever presume
to get up before a political organization
and air his prejudices and his preferences.
God forbid ! that Stanford University
should ever favor socialism of any kind.
Each man has the right as a.rrlvate citi
zen to vote and believe as he may choose,
but no professor has the right to use
the influence of his position as Professor
Ross has done: nor to get up on the ros
trum and pander to the baser elements
of prejudice. I thought that when Pro
fessor Ross was taken back and resumed
his former position at the university he
had learned a lesson he would never for
get, and I think he should now be dls
mlsVed.
ing the means for tho development not
alone of the mental and moral character
of its students, but that through the in
fluence of its atmosphere their souls shall
be so developed that when they enter
the portals of the future life beyond they
may have laid ud for themselves euch
treasures as this world alone can never
give. The development of the soul is
by far the most important thing in this
lifeâ far more necessary than professors
a& a rule realize. All education should
tend toward this, same aim, and this de
velopment .can only be obtained by fol
lowing the maxims and teachings of the
greatest of all teachers that ever lived,
our precious Saviorâ Jesus Chriet.
I read the account in the .morning Call
of the speech upon Oriental immigration,
and' then only incidentally. On May 17,
1900, I wrote Dr. Jordan .that "There is
a very deep and bitter feeling of indigna
tion throughout the community, . and I
am made to feelit in vaalous ways,, ex
pressed and Â¦ unexpressed, and in bitter
form, that Stanford. University is lending
itself to partisanism and even to danger
ous socialism; or in fact, to any questions
outside of the regular prescribed course
of instruction which the students are ex
pected to receive from their professors.".
Referring to the time of delivery of the
Oakland speech. I. said, "I did not^raen
tlon it at that. time, although I knew of
it, having read of it in' the papers, and
was informed through no one conected
with the railroad company," but by some
of our leading conservative citizens who
aro in sympathy and deeply, interested In
the future of the university and alive to
the dangerous tendencies, * vfhlch in time
will rebound ,and reflect against us all.'.'.
Of course these criticisms were express
ed upon the assumption that the lan
guage and conduct of Dr." Ross had been
as represented in the newspapers and re
ported to me, although my private opin
ion as to the fitness of Dr. Ross was
fully formed prior to and Independently
of these speeches. They were expressed
to the president in the hope that they
would constitute a- basis for a similar
opinion in his mind. .
Subsequently, whiU I was in Europe
and before- the acceptance of the; resig
nation of Dr. 'Ross' by the president. Dr.
Jordan Informed me by letter : that Pro
fessor Ross had "proved" -to him "con
clusively that nothing of the sort alleged
was ever said by him," and that tho re
port of one of the : daily newspapers to
which reference had "been 'made "was a
pure forgery." Dr. Jordan added: "Every
ono who speaks in public suffers from
this sort of thing, either careless Â¦* mis
reporting or else deliberate falsification."
The truth of this positive and complete
denial was not questioned but tacitly.ac
cepted by me, and removed the criticisms
of this speech from further consideration.
On May 26, 1900, Dr. Jordan wrote me
that he proposed to reappoint Professor
Ross upon the following terms: '
"1. That 1 (Dr. Jordan) reappoint him
as usual, letting him go ahead with his
work. " "â¢Â¦ -
"2. That he tender his resignation, to
take effect at the discretion of the'presi
dent.
"3. That he make reasonable efforts to
secure another place."
My answer was as follows: . â¢
"PALO AL.TO. Cal.. May 2S, 1900.
"President D. S. Jordan, Stanford Uni
versityâMy Dear Friend: Your com
munication dated May .25 has received
consideration.
"I am in accord with you as to reap
pointlng Professor Roas, as usual, let
ting him go ahead with his work: sec
ond, that Ue tender his resignation to
take effect at a stated time, for instance
at thft end of six months, .which gives
him 'an opportunity, and you an oppor
tunity, to make the change you suggest.
I certainly, wish to avoid,. as far as pos
sible, doing anything that would prove- an
injury to him or his future.
"Since receiving Professor Ross' com
munication (a copy of which was sent
to vou) it has occurred to me that ho
did not know that the position he took
at the time of his campaigning for Bryan,
on the silver question, was objectionable.
I have come to this conclusion and feel
very sorry that ho was. not made to
know at that time that he should be more
tactful in his utterances, and that his
course had been very severely criticized.
This has aroused my sympathy 'for him,
and I cannot but feerthat had he then
known the trwÂ° condition of. affairs this
second offense might never have occurred. ,
Very sincerely your friend.

GROUND OF CLAIM
TO MARTYRDOM FOR
FREEDOM OF SPEECH
DR: ROSS handed in his resignation
almost immediately after his ap
pointment in the spring of 1900. You
will observe that on October 4, 1900, and
before the acceptance of Professor Ross"
resignation. Dr. Jordan wrote me In Eu
r#pe that "it may be best for him to ko,
but he shoul.1 go in dignity," and con
cluded by the following: "You will par
don me for adding that. while your criti
cisms of Dr. Ross havo a. serious bas's of
fact, they do not cover the wholo size of
the man. I know better than any one else
his faults and his limitations, i do not
wrsh to belittle them,"
In justice to Dr. Ross I mu3t etate that
I cannot say from recollection or from
the correspondence laid before you toilay
that Professor Ross was fully aware of
tho fact that he had been retained
against my judgment for more than four
years before his resignation. Nor do I
believe that he had been correctly in
formed of the grounds of my criticisms
of his conduct and language. Nor do 1
think he knew that I had not questioned
the accuracy of his denials relative to
thosr; speeches.

I do not think I would have brought
this subject referring to the dismissal of
Professbr Boss before you at this late
day. even though I have suffered in abso
lute silence, had I not very lately received
a New York paper in which allusion was
made to my giving up the management
which. It was stated, had been tyrannical
and overbearing in the extreme; that I
had asked for the dismissal of professors;
that Dr. Jordan had never, been allowed
to act according to his own Judgment, and
that it would be a great relief to him to
have the contemplated change made. Be
cause of these impressions I consider it
my duty to myself and to the memory of
the absent founder to make the above
statement plain to you trustees and to
the public and to submit the whole cor
respondence to you. To do this is not
without its painful side to me. After
thoughtful, prayerful, conscientious con
sideration I concluded to take this step.

spondence relative to the resignation of
Dr. Ross and certain other papers relat

JANE L. STANFORD.
April 25. 1903.
My answer to the foregoing letters was
made from Cairo, Egypt, on January 2),
liOO, when I wrote ihe following:
"SHEPHEARDS HOTEL, CAIRO, Jan.
30, 1901.â Dr. D: S. Jordanâ Dear Friend:'
Sorse time has elapsed since writing you.
Now, as I am on the eve of starting for
the long anticipated trip up the Nile, and
expecting to take she weeks or two
months, if all goes well, I think it best to
acknpwledge the receipt of your cable
gram received here on January 2Sâ "Ask

fense certain passages from your letWs

be frank with you, I do not feel haypy
over the fact that you wish again to jus
tify your, action by quoting me. I have

"If my earnest and heartfelt prayers

I have not been well the past few weeks, i
but I think It is all in consequence of the
anxiety arid wakeful hours- that I have
spent over this trouble, and I hope the
Nile trio will be all I wish for.

trouble about Ross. ; ,
"Let me "assure you. dear friend,, that I
sympathize with you, In the anxious hourj
that vou^raust have spent over the In
suboraination on the Dart of the profes
sors who have Just resigned.- I: must say
that ' 1 'Â¦' think you w.lll be stronger and
m NOTWITHSTANDING public state-
I\i merits to the contrary. I have ex-
X pressed no opinion and have taken
or advised no action for or against any
member of the faculty of the university
who resigned since or during the discus
sion of the Ross Incident. The only
knowledge I had of the resignation of Dr.
Howard and the other professors during
the Ross discussion was derived from let
j ters received from Dr. Jordan and from
newspaper articles sent me while I was
abroad. My views, as to these matters,
were wholly unknown to Dr. Jordan until
after such resignations.
On November 22, 1900, President Jordan
wrote rae concerning Professor Howard:
"Ttyj only matter that worries me Is
that of Professor Howard. He spoke
wildly and recklessly in a moment of ex
citement, but it is very hard for him to
admit that those who kept their heads
were braver and wiser than he. I am told
that his language was more guarded than
one would Infer from the newspapers, but
the fact remains that his words carried
a most unjust implication against you.
"I know that he is very sorry for it all,
and he may come around to say so pub
licly. I have gone as far as I can to bring
him to his senses.
"I trust that you will approve of my
pardoning him if he puts himself in po
sition to be forgiven. He has been a
tower of. strength as a teacher. He is a
great -scholar. -but* a man with little ex
perience in the world, as loving as a child
and a man who is 'all heart.' The offense
Is intolerable, but I like to consider the
man and not the offense. : It Is also true
that hundreds of our graduates love Dr.
Howard like a fathef, and they will feel
that his nine years of hard and loyal ser
vice should make it more easy to pass
this matter by.. It is true that Dr. How
ard should not make this mattfer harder,
as he Is doing by his long hesitation as
to what he ought to do. But I am con
vinced that.he will come to a right view
in time. 1' feel that leniency is wisest
when a. man is sound at; heart. I am
heartily repentant for so long counseling
delay in the case of Dr. Ross. But Dr.
Howard Is a very different type of man.".
My own feelings as to Dr. Howard were
identical with those expiessed in the fore
going. .
, He wrote on January S. 3001:
"I have informed Professor ' Howari
that it is necessary for him to make a Â¦
public statement withdrawing his charges
that the dismissal of Dr. Ross Is due to .
tho influence of the spirit of commercial- j
ism or to any other influence of that !
sort. â¢ j
. "Thus far. beyond the expression of his J
regret for the occurrence, he has refused '
to do anything. I shall insist on his rtnal j
answer soon, and in case it Is not satis
factory, I shall ask at once for his resig
nation. I do not believe that I can eavc
him."
On January 15, 1901, Dr. Jordan wioto
rae from San Luis Obispo:
"You said once that Dr. Ross was a
dangerous man, when I thought him *
careless, good-natured, generous boy. He
is bpthâ a boy without a conscience,
which may be one of the most dangerous
types of man| because we are not on our
guard against him."
On January 25, 1901, he cabled me:
"Ask permission to publish in university's
defense certain passages/ from. your let
ters as Lclb and I may deem advisable. â
Jordan." To which I answered: "Cairo,
Egypt, January 25, 1901.â I decline to be
further quoted in - Ross matter. Youi*
knowledge of the man is. sufficient to de
fend university.â Stanford."
FOUNDER'S FEELING
OF LENIENCY FOR
PROFESSOR HOWARD
My own personal views regarding Pro
fessor Rosa were based upon. the consen
sus of opinion of manyâ from among the
very foremost educators of the country
to persons personally present at hta polit
ical discussions; but they were not based
upon the views of business men whose
interests were affected.
as to the founder's idea of rion-partisan
shlp. (Presumably referring to my letter
of May 9. 1900, quoted above.) The whole
matter was admirably stated and the dis
tinction between real freedom of thought
and investigation and the license to say
anything one pleases . anywhere and to
anybody was made very clear. But I was
?Â°T ry at once that I had euareested even
this, and sent another cablegram next day.
It is better that we should fight it all
out without bringing you into it. I am
sure that the final result of it all will
be good and good only." '..
On December 3, 1900, Dr. Jordan says
in part: "I differed from you solely be
cause I believed Dr. Ross was entirely
honest and would develop a worthy ca
reer elsewhere when I could find him a
place. I have never questioned that he
bad deserved dismissal, but I feared the
public discussion of such action because
I know something of the sensational
newspapers." In the same letter Dr. Jor
dan says: "He knows very well that it
was not. his. opinions or views which were
under Â¦ criticism, but his erratic methods
and reckless expression. Especially he
knows that the matter of Japanese im- i
migration was a thing of very small rela
tive importance."

GATHERING INFORMATION.
The records of the Fire Department do
not show that a single complaint has ever
been, filed against O'Connell during the
taree' years he has been Superintendent of
Btables. The reports of Chief Sullivan
. for the last three years, made to the Fire
Commissioners and transmitted by them
to the Board of Supervisors, do not dis
close sr.y complaint against O'Connell's
management of the department stables.
It is tfell known that since O'Connell
took charge three years ago he has made
taany important improvements In the
stables at the foot of Tenth street. For-
JDCfty tens cf fodder were weighed on a
'â¢mail pair of scales, but O'Connell in
*.V.iÂ«V. a complete weighing machine, in
'Â¦â¢der to prevent any shortage cf sup
plies.
1 STABLES IN GOOD ORDER.
* The system used by OConne!! In check- '
irg out fodder to the various engine
fccusfs is a very careful one. Parry re
cently made the startling statement that
I ast quantities of fedder had gone astray
f%cm the stablts. but en expert went I
Through the accounts and found that '
every pound of the feed had been account- '
ed for.
.The records cf the Fire Department also
i f;ow that a less number of horses have
been lost in the last three . year3 than
during any previous time. O'Connell's
friends Justly inf:st that this fact alone
iff proof of hi? eJTicirncy.
The writ of mandate issued at the re- ,
<jue>Â£ of O'Connell to restrain the Fire 'Â¦
CommiÂ£Â£ioners frcm removing him from
his present position wiM come up for hear
ing before Judge Murasky next Friday !
morning.
Parry has oper.ly boasted that O'Connell !
will be removed, but the Superintendent
of Slab'es proposes to make a fight to i
*ave himself. The report of the Grand ;
â¢ Jury, Bled on Thursday, deplore the !
efUc&t intention of certain persons to I
tÂ»rn the Fire Department over to the per- :
r.?cio.us spoils system. Commissioner j
Parry might be reminded of the fact that ',
Grand Juries cf Minneapolis end St. IÂ»uis '
have won fame by doing more than "riling :
report*." when the conduct of certain of- '
fir !alÂ» was investigated. Similar power Is |
held by the Grand Jury of the City and !
County of San' Francisco and the an- I
noenctd Intention of Fire Commissioner j
.Parry to get the Fire Department under â¢
Ms control will be carefully watched by â¢
thc cititzens. ,
"Thla is a rank case cf refusal to obey
orders," shouted Parry, "and there will
kave to be a change."
Chief Engineer Sullivan was not present
-*X t&e meeting of the commission, having
been called to a tire, but he was represent
Â«"d by Assistant Chief Dougherty, who
suggested that O'ConntU be either dis
missed temporarily or permanently.
In a cut and dried manner Commission
ers Barrett. Maestretti and Parry voted
tliat the entire matter be referred to Chief
Engineer Sullivan, with instructions to
have order restored in the department
etaClea and with full power to act. Com
missioner Bolla V. Watt was absent.
Yesterday Parry filfd a long rigmarole
of charg-es against O'Connell. Spite was
displayed on Parry'* face as he told the
Fire Commissioners of the alleged short
comings of O'Connell. Parry averred that
the department were In a neglect
ed condition, thai there was open mutiny
among the men under O'Connell, that the
*ffairs of OCor.nell's department were
thoroughly demoralized, that men were
doing as they pleased and that something
should be done to better affairs.
Parry claimed that he had instructed
O'Connell to report the state of things in
the department etables to Ch^ef Engineer
6ulUr&n and that O'Connell had failed to
do no.
WA2TTS O'CONNELL DISMISSED.
Having pained one point recently by
preventing' Secretary McCarthy from
<ioSn*r the -Important work cf checking: up
supplies, PÂ»rry 1? now determined to oust
Superintendent of Stables P. O'Connell.
Until the time that O'Connell testified in
the charges made against Parry by The
Call, In which the Fire Commissioner was
accused of telling a colt belonging to the
department and pocketing the proceeds,
not a single word of complaint had ever
bÂ«=en made arainst the Superintendent of
Stables.
Vâ CoinmlEsIoner Parry brazenly
rjhowed" at yesterday's meeting of the Fire
Commission that he 13 determined to
secure absolute control of the department

Dr. Jordan said that his report to the
President would not be made for some
time, for the reason that a large number
of men are now at work at various points
along the coast taking fish observations.
Not until these observers report to Dr.
Jordan will he make his report to Presi
dent Roosevelt.
Regarding the salmon fisheries Dr. Jor
dan stated that the whole key to the
question is hatcheries. To keep the
streams stocked the United States Gov
ernment must maintain hatcheries, and
in his report as commissioner he would
recommend the establishment of three
hatcheries in Alaska.
"The Canadian Government must take
similar action here," added Dr. Jordan,
"if it intends to keep the Fraser River
stocked."

Dr. Jordan has been on a two months'
trip along the northern coast in the
United States vessel Albatross. All along
the coast fish were caught, and the banks
were dredged for rare specimens. Dr. Jor
dan says he obtained specimens of twenty
new fish. On the way north the commis
sion of which Dr. Jordan is a member in
vestigated incidentally the halibut fish
eries, but as this was not the object of
the trip little time was spent In halibut
study. T..ere are halibut all along the

" Kt Bta Is LeÂ»tâ Ttere Is Â» Sort Con for Csn-

mescase of love and peace and hope and help.
Unbelievers may Â»coff and cry "fake," but I
heed them not My work hat Just be*un and
I am ttvlftK men.
The secret of this michty healins power, this
roarvelou* fluid, is known to me alone. It Is
mine to aivÂ« to whom I will, and my works
bo before me. Doubt not! I aek no man to
believe me. but I rive to every man free this
priceless boon and It restore* him Instantly to
perfect health. With thlÂ» marvelous, myste-
rious compound, which I have discovered only
after a lifetime devoted to search through all
the realms olBclenc*. and the archives of the
ancient*, it nr possible to heal at once the aw-
ful sores, clear the complexion of the copper
cpots. dry up the mucous patches, heal the
ulcers and leave the body clean and healthy
and wholesome. "With this- mysterious com-
pound no man or woman will ever train be
troubled with blood polaon or any of Its evil
; eSects.
Remember It matters not what stage your
case may be in. It matters not bow long you
have bad It, how you got It or when you cot
It. It matters not what doctors or scoffers
cay. This u no ordinary drug- or medicinal
method of treatment, but; it Is the vital life
â¢park itself, and it matters not how many rem-
edies or doctors have failed, I have repeatedly
and Instantly cured the worst old cases, healed
the tores and caused the mucous patches, cop-
per colored spots and other evidences of this
terrible poison to disappear like made. My
tecret compound never fails, and Its cures are
lastlnr : never aÂ»aln are any of my people
troubled with blood poison. My private address
Is Dr. C. Sargent Ferris, 8084 fitrawn Building,
Cleveland, Ohio, and I urKÂ« every person suf-
fering fTom blood poison to send to me and
I will forward. by first mall, prepaid, a pack-
art of my marvelous discovery. My wondrous
discovery has startled the world by Us miracu-
lous effects, and yet I seek not fame or slory.
It suffices me If I may be the humble instru-
ment of Nature's greatest power In brlng-tng-
all men to the enjoyment of perfect health,
and I do It free. In the time allotted to ma
here en etrth I shall do all that In my power
lies to rive my fellow men the benefit of this
! great secret and my reward shall bÂ» In the
knowledge that I have done unto others as I
Trould that others should do unto me.

. ON TELEGRAPH HILL.
HE . old German castle on Tele
.11 graph Ilili was almost totally de
li stroyed by a fire which broke out
â¢^ at 10:30 o'clock yesterday morning.
The main portion of the structure
was burned down, only the west wins be
ing left. . Â¦ ". . â¢ , .
The fire broke out in the cast end of the
basement and soon the big frame struc
ture was a mass of flame. The flre was a
fierce one, and it only seemed an Instant
after it was discovered before it had
reached the topmost pinnacle of the lofty
tower, which was blazing before the main
building was enveloped.
The Fire Department was early 'on the
scene, that is, it got to the foot of the
hill, and engine No; 5 was with great dif
ficulty hauled up Filbert street hill by
hIx of the biggest 'horses in the depart
ment. There It was anchored against a
telegraph pole. With the aid of the hun
dreds of small boys in that neighborhood
the hose was quickly hauled over the
rocky path and a great stream was soon
pouring on the seething Mantes.
By this time the flre had assumed a
most spectacular appearance. A sudden
Â¦ wind had sprung up and seemed to lash
the flames into fury. The tower, was all
ablaze and the flames were leaping high
into the sky. Suddenly almost the whole
burning mass fell with a terrific crash,
sending up thousands of blazing cinders,
which gave the appearance of the burst
ing of a mammoth skyrocket ,
INCENDIARISM: CHARGED.
The flre went out as suddenly as it
started. Its origin is unknown. â¢-
The occupants of the building were A.
Vincent, his wife and their two \ small
boys. Emile and Otelio, aged 4 and 3,'re
spectively.
Mrs. Vincent was running. the place as
an afternoon resort for tourists. She
charged an admission of 10 cents, and
served light refreshments, so that she
managed to derive quite a nice little in
come. She had no rent to pay, and was
allowed the place^ for its caretaking.
The' Vincents p'ractically lost every
thing. The only things raved were a few
personal effects. They carried no insur
ance. *

Midsummer High Jinks.
On the brow of; this hill,- early in 1S30.
Sweeney & Baugh' put up a - f rame struc
ture about thirty feet square,- on the top
of wWch'wasa shaft about twenty; feet
high. \ Qn this shaft , were . long arms > of
different'- sizes and'i colors,' and the ap

SERVED MANY PURPOSES. ,
During Us. existence the building was
jccupied for all kinds of' purposes. At
Dnc time Duncan C. Ross gave a series of
hippodrome' performances there. " The
Telegraph Hill Observatory Athletic Club
also made Us home there. Â¦â¢
Then It became an art studio and finally
it got to be a cheap lodging-house. .
About three years ago Oray Bros., the
contractors, bought the property and
used tjie building as a boarding-house fÂ»r
the" rtien In their employ. Mrs. Vincent
again made It a resort last February. -
No* point in â¢San-. Francisco., la better
known that Telegraph Hill. It Is closeiy
ldentltted with the settlement. of theidty.
In the early -fifties it was a point '.to which
every eye. was. turned as soon "as day
broke and It was the lost place, on which
the eye rested as: the' sun went down be
yond .the Golden Gate. \- It was. the sjgnal
station In those days that told the ,pio
neers of the arrival ; of the v craft that
brought them news fronj far away and
which* "placed them in touch* with home
arid with the news of the world at' large.
It was the point ' from which the people
of the city received the joyful news; that
California had been admitted "as a State
to the Union. Â¦Â¦H8mm&&&6&iMÂ§iM&?i
property, could throw no light on the ori
gin of the lire. He said the original cost
af the building was about $30,000. He esti
mated the loss to bo somewhere in the
vicinity of $3000. .....
The Building, was erected in 18S2 by a
company, of which F.. O. Layman was
the manager. The Intention was to havo
it ' sort, of high-clasa " pleasure resort,
where people could enjoy the magnificent
panoramic, view of the Golden Gate, the
bay and the surrounding country. To fa-,
dlitate getting there, the old Telegraph
Hill Cable Railroad was built, which con
nected with the old Omnibus Railway
Company. The cable line up the hill was
removed some time ago.
For the (list two years the place was
fairly nroj-peroiis, buf.at the end of. th.att
time it became a sort of hoodlum 'resort.
Adolph Sutro^then bought the .property,
with the idea' that he could rehabilitate
the placo. He was unsuccessful in this
and little by little It fell into disuse arid
decay- .
viceâservice of commercial as .weU â¢ aÂ»
poetical interestâ the- . building, showed
sign? of disintegration and with great re
luctance on the. part- of alt- those - for
whom it he,Id .so many fond" associations
the old , landmark was t pulled.. dawn" and
in 1882 the 'Â¦â¢ castle., which burned yester
day, was erected on its Tery stte: .
" Hence it was in the early days that the
hill Was the objective point of vision
from early morn and until late at night.
As years went on it became the. custom
of tourists, travelers and . the public at
large to visit.. the hill and carve.upon the
frame structure of Sweeney.Â£&* Baugh
either their names or theirj .inltiata/- ...
.'The owners at the- start ,; tried to -put a
stop to this practice, but. It iutd. become
such a fad that they \, removed reifralnt
and every one from far, and 1 near, added
his mark to thq hlsto'ric 'old 'structure..
It ,1s â¢' estimated. ' thatVmore than; 4CD0O
names were carved there, and. these rep
resented people from every .place, ; clime
and spot on the laCe of the earth. , Â¦
After twenty-four years of valuable ser-
ignation. -The news was transmitted .to
Telegraph Hill from Point Lobos by a
similar code, of signals. " " V
MARKED HISTORIC SPOT.
When Miss Hopper flrBt announced her
intention of appealing to the courts of
'Victoria to set aside the will of Alexander
Dunsmulr and it became known that she
had engaged the services of Judge Coyne
of New York the gossips of the Eastern
metropolis insisted that she was being
financiered in her legal undertaking by
young Elklns. and for support of this con
tention the fact was cited that her lawyer
was the attorney of the Elkinses. To
this insinuation, however, Judge Coyne
gave an indignant denial yesterday and
added that Miss Hopper in securing hla
services had been prompted by persons
entirely foreign to the. interests ' of the
Elkins family.
gave rise to the first stories that a mutual
attachment originating in New York some
months previous existed between them.
Later it was reported that Elkins Sr. had
warned his son that a marriage between
the latter and the actress, which was gos
siped In the East as a possibility, would
not be condoned. Stephen Jr. has since
tried to overcome the objection of his
parent and in this endeavor he ls'eaid to
have been assisted by Miss Hopper, whose
consent to a marriage is reported to
hang conditionally iipon the success of the
young man in his pleadings with his
father.
However, Stephen Elkirii Jr. Is in San
Francisco and expects to remain here

"the East, which will not be for several
weeks. Two' years ago ' Edna Wallace

It is apparent that some effort has been
made to conceal the fact that he is In
the oitv. Jn Bit far as It might become
the basis of a telegraphic story to one of
th-* Eastern newspapers, for It is under
wtocd/ln New- -York, so a telegram from
there/ last evening stated, that Stephen
Flkiirs Jr. is enjoying himself somewhere
along the Atlantic ccast instead of bask
ing in the presence of Edna Wallace Hop-
an effort was made yesterday to
secure an admission from Miss Hopper
that Elkins had been her -frequent guest

in deep ignorance of the fact that young
Elkins is Â«n- the city op that the- New

attention to Miss Hopper one of the
younger Elkinses might easily be con
strued as indicating an Intention on the
part of the Judge to shield the wooers
from publicity. ; â
JUDPE COYNE IS EVASIVE.
Elkins Jr. accompanied Miss Hopper
from- the north, whither. she and her at
torney. Judge E. P. Coyne of New York,
went several weeks ago to prosecute her
case in the court at Victoria. On the re
turn trip, arriving at Portland, fellow
travelers cf the actress noticed a well
dresxed young man, evidently a stranger
In that part of the world, suddenly ap
proach Miss Hopper, and greet her In a
friendly manner. There was an interest-
Ing return- of the courtesy, a Ions and
quiet conversation between the young
man and the actress, ana a parting. The
incident might have been forgotten by
the ether travelers had not the young
man appeared aboard the south-bound
train 'ater and renewed his attentions to
Miss Hopper.
The following day when the train Â¦ ar
rieO at the Oakland pier and Miss Hop
per debarked with a view of going to her
country home in Haywards the same
young man was acaln by her side and
pallantly accompanied her aboard the
Oakland localand saw her safely to her
destination. It developed later that Miss
Hopper's escort was young Elkins, who
Is strongly suspected of having prear
ranged the meeting at Portland.
Since their arrival here little has been
Feen of Elkins except when Miss Hopper
crosses the bay on business engagements
with her attorney. While 'she and Judge
Coyne are deliberating over, their legal
problems Elkins may be seen quietly

In fact, it is. understood, and The Call
has ample "authftrlty ' f6r the assertion,
that " their betrothal* is ;certaln to follow
the first assurance that the younger El
kins receives from his father of parental
condonation for, his matrimonial step.
That he wil! receive this assurance^ is
only- a matter ' of "hope and speculation
with the younc lovers, for already the
elder Elkms has sternly emphasized his

If Bilious
Shown to Be Absolutely False by
Modern Science. .
People used to think that baldness was
one of thpse things which are 'handed
down from generation to generation, from
father to sonâ Just like a family heirloom.
i Science has shown the falseness of this
belief by proving that baldness Itself is
not a constitutional disease, but the result
of a germ Invasion, of which only Herpi-
cide can effectually rid the scalp.
Washing only cleans the scalp of dan-
druff: it doesn't kill the germs. .
Destroy ' the cause, you remove the ef-
fect."
Newbro's Herpicide will do this in every
case. It Is also a delightful dressing.

A cane f*id to be without parallel is

sweaty-three different doctors were pur-

in-two weeks and finally grot entirely well .
by using the scientific food Grape-Nuts.
Thie child's another was asked to tell
about tbe case, and eaid: "Six years ago
without a moment's warning my boy
went off Into convulsion^. He had three
the first day, and for nearly six years he
had frora thrÂ«e to sixty spasms a day,
all of vcrv short duration but very se-
vere. He lost his speech entirely and
loft the use cf his Ices and arms, also
<f hi? nerve centers, being paralyzed, so
that he was perfectly bcJpless and dumb.

him treated by physicians in many of
the larse cities throughout the country
without being able to get any. help at all.
"16 nil twenty-three different physicians

"He did not sum to have a disease of
t,ny kind, and as the physicians were all
baffled I Â«J1Â«1 not know what to do. and
we gave \ip hope. The doctors said his
nerves and brain were affected and poor
circulation and eerebrosplnal irritation
caused his convulsions. Tie had as h!{?n

doctors raÂ«i trsttfy.
"New comes the wonderful part of tne

>â¢"â *^ OMPLETE reports of the" Immigration Bureau for the fiscal year ending with June show
/ that the total number of immigrants for that period amounted to 921,315, exceeding the
1 j immigration of the previous year by upward vof 200,000 and breaking all records of for-
mer years. Of the entire number who applied only 8769 were debarred under the law
from landing, showing tha't the steamship companies have been more careful in excluding undesirable
immigrants, or else that they have found a means of evading the law with more success than for
merly.
Students, of the immigration problem are convinced that while the prosperity of the United
States and the high rate of wages that prevails here are direct inducements to a large immigration,
yet they do not by any means account for the .whole of it. It is noted that a considerable percentage
of the newcomers are from parts of Europe where but little understanding is had of American con-'
ditions and where the people are not inclined,* to venture .upon a hazard' of new fortunes of their
own motion. Such immigrants come because of urging by outsiders and are not in any sense enter
prising or progressive people seeking to better their conditions, but merely discontented and unset
tled persons who are easily persuaded by others to do anything or go anywhere for a change.
It- is asserted that those who are chiefly responsible for the discontented immigration are 'the
agents of the large steamship companies. One report says: "A careful investigation of the meth
ods pursued by these companies is 'now being made, under the direction of Commissioner General
Sargent, by special agents of the Immigration Bureau traveling in Europe for that purpose. The re-'
ports of these, agents show that the sections of Europe mentioned are completely honeycombed with;
a system of secret agents of the steamship companies: Emigration is induced by flattering descrip
tions of. the United States, both printed and oral. Thelaws of the countries themselves are evaded
for this purpose. In many . cases priests, preachers, school-teachers and even magi strates and police
officers are the paid agents of the transportation "companies."
That sort of immigration is by no means desirable, and it is pleasing- to learn that the Govern
ment is to make determined efforts to put a stop to it. ' It is all well enough for steamship companies
to employ- enterprising agents to worÂ£ diligeii^y to get business and passengers for thei r T lines, but
nevertheless we do not wish to be made victims of their zeal: Immigration at the rate of nearly a
million people a year may be flattering to our country, but there arc some kinds of flattery' we can af
ford to forego for a while. .. Â£ * Â¦ "*, Â¦â¢ :Â¦ 'â¢' '/-.-".â¢'
IMMIGRATION PROMOTERS
AVAUTIER - DUFANE, who
has long been experimenting
in the telephotographic field
and gradually approaching
â¢ ideal practical results, eeems
to achieved his aim.
With the assistance of the Geneva as
tronomer.' Scheer, he has succeeded in
constructing a machine or instrument
which has given some marvelous results
and he is now engaged in constructing
another from which still better work is
confidently expected.
The following description of the instru
ment, with illustrations of telephotlc re
sults already obtained, taken from the
Scientific American, will prove of very
general Interest:
The apparatus Is 40 centimeters in
length, the diameter of the" objective be
ing 0.10 centimeters and the focal length
1.20 meters. It is hoped to obtain go-xl
instantaneous photographs with ex
posures ranging between 1-200 and 1-5M
second. The same apparatus may be
used to take ordinary photographs with
an objective 0.25 meters in focal distance.
The following advantages are claimed
for this Ingenious device, as compared
with tde-objectlves: Greater intensity,
better definition, higher magnification ana
an easier adjustment. As regards the
neatness of images, the views presented
before the members of the congress were
perfectly sharp as far as the edges of
the field of view. Twelve-fold magnifica
tions were obtained, without the appara
tus ceasing to be portable.
The scheme of the apparatus, as con
structed by Messrs. Boissonnas & Co.,
(Ltd.). Geneva, Switzerland, is shown in
the diagram. The rays emerging from
the objective A will strike the plane mir
ror B, by which they are reflected on the
second mirror C, to be conveyed after an
other reflection to the photograpmcal
plate placed at D. By substituting for
the long distance objective an ordinary
ome (with a focal distance of 20 or 30 cm.),
ihe apparatus may be made to sert'e for
ordinary photographs. The. "Telephot"
may, moreover, be, at a moment's notice,
converted into a terrestrial or astronomi
cal telescope.
Our Illustrations show the principle of
the apparatus as well as some photo
graphs taken with it.
Telephotography in Its new form is
likely to prove useful both for scienUfic
tnd industrial purposes, as well as in
warfare. The physicist will be able to
photograph any phenomenon visible at
the extreme horizon, such as mirages,
etc.. as well as those which ho could not
ipproach himself without danger, such
it, for instance, volcanic eruptions. The
naturalist may now safely observe wild
animals and photograph them from a dis
tance. The amateur astronomer will be
in a portion to take splendid views of the
principal heavenly bodies. The explorer
of Arctic regions will observe, by means
of the "Telephot." distant and inacces
sible points. Archaeologists and archi
tects will use the apparatus to fix on the
photographic plate buildings and monu
ments too distant to be taken with an
ordinary apparatus. Military and naval
officers will be able to observe and to
study the movements ez. the enemy (the
apparatus may # in fact be well used as
a telescope); finally, all topographical
measurements will highly profit by this
ingenious apparatus.

In addition to * the two great canals
which are likely to be built on the Ameri
can continent at Panama and between
the Great Lakes and tne Hudson River,
there is now under consideration, with
the approval of the British Government, a
scheme for building a ship canal through
Scotland, from the Firth of Forth to the.
Clyde, at an estimated cost of $50,000,000.
This is not the first time that the idea
has been mooted. The favorable topog
raphy .of the country between the two
great efstuarics, coupled with the great
advantages commercial and military,
to be secured by cutting this water
way, ha*,', naturally attracted the at
tention 'both;; of the British Govern
ment, which, has licked at the soIicjsu?
from ' the v view ; point of its great
strategic advantages, and of the capi
talist, who pias always . been fully alive
to the ' commercial facilities afforded by
such a short cut from the North Sea to
the Atlantic as would be provided by a
Forth^Clyde canal. The British admiral
ty Is now constructing a great naval base
â¢on the Firth of Forth for the use of the
North Sea fleet, and the cutting of the
canal would at once double the strategic
Â¦value of this base, since it would enable
the fleet to reach the Atlantic by steam
ing a distance of only forty miles. Com
mercially, the canal would be valuable
as opening up a direct route from the
North Sea To Canadian and New England
ports. ,
We have heard of many novel uses to
which the overhead carrier system has
been put, but probably the most ingenious
of them all is that of a St. Louis hard
ware merchant, who moved the greater
part of his stock from one store to.an
other, which was located on the other
side of the street, almost directly oppo
site. A. steel 'cable V& inches thick and
tested for 600 pounds, was thrown across
the street from the window of one es
tablishment to the other, . a span of
eighty-one feet. On'thhs there was strung
a steel box and as the goods were taken
from the. shelves In one establishment
they were placed in boxes and marked.
These were loaded In the cage. Gravity
carried the load across the street, and
the box was brought back by the aid of
a hand windlass. The steel box made a
round trip every minute and the" daily av
erage was 500 per day. The average load
was 300 pounds. In this manner all the
shelf goods were handled and the opera
tion was performed without the slightest
confusion, the goods practically going di
rect from their. place in the old store to
their permanent location Jn the new es
tablishment, rhskbsrew

RECENTLY there were submitted to the Board .of Estimate and Apportionment of New
York City a number of plans for public buildings in and around City Hall Park whose cbst
in the aggregate will approximate $5O,ooo,ooq. ; It is not the intention of the. city authori
ties to expend all that money at once. Jn fact, the cost of the structures to be undertaken
immediately/will not exceed $10,000,000. The object of plans for the whole series of
structures is that of for the future so that the buildings now to be undertaken may be
used as the beginning of a grand scheme of improvements which when^ompleted will result in a group
of architectural masses unsurpassed in the world. '
The New York Times in describing the plans says: "Under the general proposition the City
Hall park will be cleared of eveiy building except the Cify- Hall Itself, which will be used by the
Mayor alone as an office, the rest of the building to be employed for museum purposes. The park
will be extended to Ann street on the south, while across Chambers^street on the north it is planned
to construct an elaborate granite stairway and portico. At the bridge terminal, for the use of city
offices, it is proposed to construct a campanile rising forty-five stories in height, and to dwarf such
structures as the present Park Row, building. Commissioner Lindenthal suggests that the general
scheme, if carried out in its entirety, will create a square larger and far more artistic than Trafalgar
square, in London; the Place de la Concorde, in Paris; the Schloss platz, in Berlin, or the Rathhaus
The presentation of such a plan carefully worked out by a commission appointed by the city
and employing the services of able architects and artists is an evidence of the growing esthetic sense
of the American people. It is not in New York only that Americans are devising grand schemes
and plans for the improvement of their cities, nor is the work left to public authorities. Private en
terprise has been quick to see the advantage of grouping notable structures around some; central
square or other point of vantage, and as a result the appearance of our cities is undergoing a rapid
change for the better. The New York plan of preparing ahead for future buildings when under
taking any notable work at present is a good one, and is by no means confined to that city. In fact,
the whole country is moving forward, and in a time not far distant students of architecture will come
to America from Europe, instead of going from here there, to see the best the wdrld has to show in
the wav of stately edifices.- . :

Two rival publishers, who have under
taken and advertised new and complete
editions of the work of Charles Lamb,
will be rather chagrined when they dis
cover that their "complete" editions, 1
though comprising much hitherto unpub
lished matter, are not by any means com
plete. John Holllngshead. who, perhaps,
knows more about Lamb than anybody
else, has had a long time in his possession
some interesting letters, which tell the
story of . the most interesting period of
Lamb' life.
It is. in fact, quite a romance. Of
course, nearly everybody knows Lamb
had a disappointment in love and never
married. The lady, to whom he offered
marriage was Frances j Kelly, a distin
guished actress.- At 'the time, says Mr.
Holllngshead. they were near neighbours.
Lamb living with his sister at 20 Russell
street, Covent Garden, and Miss Kelly
living opposite. Lamb's offer of marriage,
which Mr. Hollingshead possesses, covers
a long letter, which, according to Mr. Hol
lingshead; was the noblest aqd most dig
nified letter he ever wrote.
A firm but kind and delicate " refusal
was returned, to which Lamb replied in
a short letter showing that he had antlci
pated the disappointment, but felt It deep
ly. . These letters arc to be printed In fac
simile in a magazine shortly.
Thus another romance, hidden away for
so many years, will be*lald bare.
I am told that George Gissing's new
novel will be published in the late . au
tumn. It Is entitled "Will Warburton,"
and is. I believe a domestic story in the
lighter vein of that author's work. I am
sorry to say, however, that Mr.". Glssing\4
health Is causing a little anxiety among
his friends. He had consented to deliver
two lectures on Dickens before the Royal
Institution, but has been constrained to
give up the Engagement, owing to the
state of his health.'
â¢ Some interesting statistics of. the book
trade are published by the Author, show-
Ing imports and exports during the last
five years..
From these it seems that, more than
half of the exports in books have been to
tl.e United States, Germany coming sec
ond, and, strange to say, Japan is third.
The death of Max O'Rell also created
an increased demand not only for his
latest work, "Rambles in Womanland,"
but for his earlier books.
With these exceptions the publishers
and booksellers seem to have been doing
very. Door business.
The new volumes in six shilling fiction
were bv no means numerous. The two
productions which did the best were "In
the Guardianship of God" and "A Pitcher
in Paradise."
Publishers have finished taking stock of
their business, which they havo been do
ins during the last month. The results
are both interesting and instructive.
/The fluctuations of the preceding month
were followed by a period of persistent
slackness, which proved very trying and

QUT of the application of the Southern Pacific Railroad for franchises, in Alameda there
has arisen one of those controversies between municipalities and corporations which in
our time are not unexpected and are perhaps inevitable. If the controversy be carried on
in the right" spirit no harm can conic of it, for it is but just that each side should endeavor
to make the best terms possible for itself; /There is always danger, however, iii matters of this kind
that demagogues will intervene and a simple business proposition be distorted into a senseless, 'an
tagonism .which will work injury all around. It is therefore essential at this juncture to remind the
parties concerned in the present controversy that each side should dismiss demagoguery and threats
and leave the decision of the case to the dictates of common sense.
It may be noted in theifirst place that any declaration on the part of an official of the com
pany that it would refuse to operate a railroad in Alameda unless all its terms arc accepted is unwar
ranted and foolish. The franchises are too valuable and the business too important to the company
to be abandoned merely for the sake of spite or for the purpose of showing power. The city and the
railroad are in need each of the other, and it is as foolish for they railroad to threaten to abandon
the city as it would be for the city to threaten to tear up the tracks and force the railroad out.
On the other-hand, the demand of some of the citizens of Alameda4hat the Trustees shall not
grant a franchise for a term in excess of five years is one of those absurdities which if put into prac
tice will result in a' most serious handicap upon the welfare of the community. It would be tanta
mount to ordering not only the Southern Pacific Company but every other responsible railroad cor
poration out of the city. ; No board of directors of any kind of corporation would invest the money of
their stockholders in an enterprise involving the expenditure of millions of dollars on a franchise that
would expire almost as soon" as the work was completed. A five years' franchise is not sufficient to
justify any railroad company in supplying the service which Alameda needs. That much is known to
every business man in Alameda and out of il and as a consequence the demand for such restrictions
upon the franchise should be set aside summarily.
The issue is one which to a greater or less extent affects the whole State. We cannot afford
to have any considerable community in California take action tending to check the investment of cap
ital in the development of; the resources of the State or the improvement of its transportation facili
ties. We need more railroads and we are likely to get them in the immediate future if we give fair
treatment to the corporations, which alone are capable of supplying them. If we offer inducements
to capital, it will come. If we antagonize it, hamper it, handicap ,it with restrictions which render
profits impossible, or at least' hazardous, it will let us alone. By imposing such terms we shall de
lay our own advancement and force capital to seek Pacific Coast outlets elsewhere, and so promote
our rivals while injuring ourselves.
The Trustees of Alameda owe it to themselves and to their city to act like sagacious men of
business in dealing with the issue. They should offer franchises that are worth something. It *is their
duty under the law to obtain the best terms they can for the city in granting the franchise, and but
little reflection will be needed to show them that a five-year franchise will be so valueless that it can
result in no benefit to the city nor to any one else. Moreover, the issue should be settled promptly. It
is f a matter of business and should be dealt with not only with business-like sagacity, but with busi-

; Courts of the California Club and
j the Public Courts Are
Thronged.
Some spirited practice matches were
played yesterday on the California Club
tennis courts. Nearly all of the best
players were in attendance ajid the courts
were in great demand.
The best match of the day : was a dou
bles between Dr. McChesney and H. But
ler on one side and Sidney Salisbury and
Frank Stringham on the other. After
losing the first set Butler and McChesney
pulled out the next two by clever net
work. Butler has recently Joined the club
and has made rapid strides. He has an
excellent style and with a little more
practice will be a hard man for any of
the cracks to beat. ;
After an absence of more than two
months from the courts Herbert Schmidt,
the most promising of the younger play
ers, commenced practice yesterday and
was off considerably in his game. He
played a. tie match with Harry Rolfe,
each winning a set. Rolfe has. been prac
ticing constantly of late and consequently
has brought his game up considerably.
His strongest points aro his serve and
back-hand drives. : '.
Dr. Hill and Dr. McChesney finished an
interesting one-set match in ijingles. : It
was by far the longest set cf the day
and finally went to Hill, 10-8. 5
Dr. C. H. Pierce, the champien of Wat
sonville. Joined the club yesterday and in
his first match made a good impression.
In a match with Carl Gardner he lost the
first set, 6-4. He showed to better advan
tage in the second, .taking it by a score
of 6-1. Dr. Pierce is an enthusiastic
player and will undoubtedly progress rap
idly with the good practice he will secure.
He so outclassed the other players at
Wataonvllle that he could get no good
practice, and therefore was unable to im
prove much. â¢ . |
The following matches were played:
Dr. Hill and Dr. McChesney beat Sidney
Salisbury and Carl Gardner. 6-4; Gardner and

Spedal Dispatch to The Call
It seems Mott and Sefiffley. with an alleged
Constable from Alameda and some workmen,
went vp there laet Friday afternoon, armed
with axefe. wagons and other things. Sedgley
rhowed aa order from President Mott. giving
Krecman permission to tear down the town.
Freeman never doubted iu authority aad let

heh> them in the work.
They worked a'.t night, tearing the village
/town In the morning it was a stack of lum

I'll fcrr* them to put it back where they frot

Things did not go well with the powder
company, however. The directors quar
reled among themselves and the promised
profits did not materialize. So after
struggling along for nearly two years, the
business was suspended, the mortgagors
foreclosed on the mortgage and in June
lajst a decree cf foreclosure was granted
them, with permission to fell the plant
on a day in August.
- Xotv- it happened that Postmaster
Schmidt went on a flying trip to Martinez
last Saturday on business connected with
this very mai ter. So when the train drew
near International he looked out to eee
if the village was still there. But lo and
behold, it was not^there. There wasn't a
eign cf it on the horizon. Then Postmas
ter Schmidt got eff thÂ© train at Sobrante
to go back and find the village. All he
could find was a man plowing over a field
where the town of International once
stood. The rest of the Btory is told in
Postmaster Schmidts own words, as fol

Berkeley OSce San Francisco Call,
atS Center Street. July 25.
A â¢whole village vanished la a eight,
Â¦wiped from *-he face of the earth, utter
ly destroyed as was Sodom of oldâ that Is
what Geurge Schmidt, postmaster of thÂ«
city of Berkeley, never thought he would
Uv to see with his own eyes. But he
Â« xp^rieaced the phe-nomenon; that is, if
he can trust those eye? cf his. and he
etsr.ds prepared to swear in public that
where once stood the little town of In
ternational, Contra Costa County, there
is nothir.2 now but a stretch of barren
acres, with never a house In sight. And
what is more, this village was not blotted
out by a tornado or a cloudburst or a fire,
but by the hand of man.
As the story goes. Postmaster Schmidt,
;-iÂ£ t.rother, "William J. Schmidt, aiid An-
Fon.S. Blake, the capitalist, sold some six
tcies cf land near Sobrante, Contra Costa
County, two years ago to the Internation
al Explosives- Company, of which R. B.
Mott ar.d W. I. Sedgley of Alameda are
the president and manager, respectively.
The pricÂ« of the land was %&>JQ and in
? xchange for it the Schmidts accepted
ttOOO in stock of the company and a 12000
mortgage. Upon thi? land the Interna
tiona! Explosives Company built a pow
der manufacturing plant and called It In
ternatioriaJ. Besides the eight buildings
occupied by the machinery, there were six
or seven Tiouses for the workmen.

We believe that this ticket, which represents
In the fullest degree the Republican party of
the district, will, if nominated, be elected by a
large majority.
On behalf of these combined committees the
executive committee now reports that the mem
bers of these several committees met, and
after full deliberation now report twenty names
for the consideration of the club and recom
mend that they - bo nominated as delegates to
the municipal convention.
Among these twenty names will be found
the first vice president, the secretary and a
majority of the 1 executive committee of the
Central Bepubllcan Club, usually called the
Horace Davis Club. These gentlemen, how
ever, are all on the roll of this club as It was
originally organized in 1000. The ticket which
we recommend has and will have the unquali
fied support of. Mr. Davis, the president of the
other organisation, and, we confidently be
lieve, of a very large majority of the members
of that club. In discussing the selection of a
ticket the gentlemen from the other organiza
tion named ten cf the twenty names and ten
were chosen *y our committees. We found In
discussing the matter that there Is a complete
harmony of tsentlment and purpose between
them and usâ we all stand for home rule in
the Forty-first District, against any dictation
or interference with the district from the out
side, and for the nomiuatlon for office of none
but tried Republicans.
The Republican Club 'of thÂ£ Forty-flrst
Assembly District of which A, K. Dajr

Why All Sales Do * Not Meet With
' , -Success. - .
There arc many merchants who make
themselves believe if they advertise a sale
the public will come with a rush. , The
public, as a' -rule, respond, but if they
don't find the bargains offered they soon
give such places the cold shoulder. Lately
there have I been all kinds, of -sales, but
most of them fell flat .with the exception
of Kelly & Llebes\Â»120 Kearny street,, re
moval sale, which continues to be a great
success, for the reason that 'this firm

appoint the public. , â¢

agreed to grant the. advance In wages,
providing T the. new scale should not go

for setting that date being that a num

months would be necessary, . so that con
tractors may be protected.

TENDERED A BANQUET
In the estate of Anna Grace, Young
found two items on the register of fees
having been paid amounting to $12 and
$11. The cash book shows payments of
$2 and $1 only, and the register 'bears
evidence of a "I" having been inserted
before the "2" and "1." The attorney
for the estate, on request, produced a re
ceipt for $18 25, signed on March 19. 1900",
by "v\ F. Northrup. The fact that North
rup entered up $20 as having been re
ceived subsequently to the payment | of
the first fees shows that Â¦ he was over
bold in making his entries and made no
attempt at bein* accurate. . ;
In the matter of the estate . of Mrs.
Margaret Byron. Miss Margaret Byron
produced a receipt for. $16 20, signed by
Northrup, for which no entry appears
cither in the register or cash book. The
attorney for the estate Informed Young
that he waa satisfied that ho had paid
$27 75 in fees, which was all that was
supposed to be collected, but no entry
of the payment appears on the clerk's
records. . ' '
FALSIFIES FIGURES.
Young also has discovered what lie
terms a plain steal of $30 on the part
of ' Northruj?. . In making an' examination
of the books 'of the County Clerk, Young
found that in the. estate of Minnie Wet
zel et al. an Hem appears upon the reg
ister under date of November . 23, 1S92,
showing that the sum of $31 was paid for
statutory fees. Young says there is evi
dence j of the insertion in red i ink of . a
"3" between the dollar mark and the "1,".
making the amount as stated $31, whereas
the - cash book of that date shows the
payment to have been but $1. ;
Young immediately sent- a communica
tion ' to Georce D. Shadburne, attorney
for Kate Wetzel, guardian of the .minor
heirs, asking him when the sum $30
was paid.' The final account of the guard
ian, filed September 8, 1899, does not cover
this amount.
APPROPRIATES FEES.
On December 3, 1838, Young says North
ryp pocketed $14110 he collected as fees
In. the Joseph P. Hale estate, and on
April 1, 1899, he misappropriated, $116 from
fees paid in the estate of Elizabeth C.
Pfltret. ' â¢ s â¢'â¢ " - "â¢ â¢Â» ;
Expert Young of the. Hassell; Audit
Company informed Mayor ,Schmits^yes
terday that if his discoveries of the pecu
lations of fees in the probate department
continue at the present ratio the aggre
gate sum stolen from the city will amount
to between 520,000 and $25.000, ' and may
reach a much higher, figure. Young says
the investigation covers a â¢ period begin
ning March 28,- 1895, and runs for two
years, leaving the records of eight years
yet to be experted. "
Young says that up to the present time
V. F. Northrup, ex-probate clerk, I has
misappropriated in round figures' $2250.
Young has written about 500- letters to
attorneys of various estates asking what
amounts they have paid In for fees.
More than $4000 additional of such pay
ments, which appear in the register as
due, but not credited on the cash book,
arc to be accounted for and will swell

made it the plain duty: of the court not
to temporize with offenders of this class.
He intended at, that time to give them the
limitâ ten years each., â¢
A further appeal was made yesterday
by counsel for the defendants, which was
supported i by. the "Assistant . District ' At
torney. The Judge said in reply that cases
of youthful offenders cast a grave : re
sponsibility on the court and the records
â¢would show that it had been his custom
to grant j concessions to . young criminals.
He was always .loth to send youths to
the -penitentiaries, but preferred < to let
them go on probation. The courts, how
ever, owed a duty to the public and must
see that \ the, law -was .-.vindicated. ! This
was -a serious â¢ crime and ' many similar
crimes had Â¦ of late been committed . by
young men' born and reared- in this city,

Judge 'said: "'"I am anxious to' be lenient
with you and at the same time satisfy my

VIENNA. July "25.â Details received
from. Budapest regarding the suffering of
an Infantry regiment front the extraor
dinary heat during a maneuver march
from Trcblr.ye to Eilek last Monday, on
which 450 men were prostrated, indicate
that bad handling of the regiment was
largely Tefponelble for the men being
overcome. The troops are alleged to have
been burdened with extra equipment In
addition to the usual heavy marching or
der, ar.d were engaged two hours in a
sham f-frht. This necessitated a forced
march in the hottest hours of the day.
The colonel comrsandlBg the regiment re
fused to grant the request of come of his
officers that the soldiers be allowed to
rtst, though he himself was incapacitat
ed, being obliged to finish the march In a
carriage.
â¢ Before reaching Bilek the men fell out
of the ranks by scores. Nine died Im
mediately and twenty-two were carried
off insensible, ntx of whom died soon
after reaching the hospital. Seventy oth
ers are in a tcrious condition.
During the march the thermometer reg
istered 125 degrees In the sun.
The captain of another company that
v.aij operating In this vicinity ordered a
halt and brought his command in without
a *:nglÂ« prostration.
Considerable excitement exists in civil
and military circles over what is termed
the unjustifiable handling of troops in

The ring is known to have been lost
twice before. Among the state papers
preserved at Slmancas, near Valladoltd,
Spain, is a letter from Count Onver. then
Spanish Embassador at Rome, saying:
"Slxtus V has been very HI from anxiety
and vexation. The vexation to which I re
fer was due the missing fisherman's
ring. He carried it with him In a purse
and discovered that he had been robbed
of It by a cup-bearer. I7nlc5s the publicity
given to the affair obliges him to punish
tho roan he will not do so or even dismiss
him which shows his affection for those
who* lerve him. The Pope wouM do any
thing to avoid showing the world that
hlÂ« confidence had been abused."
In September. lSK>,.the late Pope wan
one day asked for an audience by an
under servant, an<J, yielding to curiosity,
he granted It. whereupon the ma* enter
ed and. kneeling. 'Mid:
"Your Holtness, I have to restore to
you what has been a loss not only to
vou. but to the world."
* After these words the man proffered thÂ«j
fisherman's ring, which had been fount!.
Pope Leo looked at it in surprise and
then said:
â¢'The thanks of the church are due to
you, my son. I shall sec that you *u*
rewarded." j '
The next day the â¢ man called at tliÂ«
Treasury anÂ«i was given $C. The ring has
never been seen since, a? Pope Leo pri
vately hid It or locked it up, so great
was his fear of losing it again. The Vati
can authorities are confident that the
ring will be fonml.
On several occasions -the ting was taken
from the papacy by force. In 1797 the
French republicans, invading the papa)
estates, despoiled th* Pope or all hit
valuables and among them the fisher
man's ring. It was returned the next
day, as It had no Intrinsic value.
. ROME. July S.â The belief Is prevalent
in the Vatican that the mining fisher
man's ring has not been stolen, but was
secreted in some nook by the late Pope
stnd will in time be found. When the time
came to take the fisherman's ring from
Pope ,Leo's finger it developed that
another was put into its place. This diil
not surprise any one. as generally the Pon
tiff does not wear the ring, it being less of
an ornament than an unused seal. At
the first meeting of the Congregation of
Cardinals after the Pope's death, when
the ring should have been broken, the
ceremony was omitted and it was put on
record that the ring for the moment
could not be found.

who had won the universal esteem of tho
world.
Cardinal Oreglia, dean of tho College of
Cardinals, arose and answered In Italian.
He thanked the diplomatists in the name
of the Sacred College for the part all of
the governments had taken' in the mourn
ing of the church. He eulogized Pope
Leo and his work during his long pon
tificate and ended with expressing the
hope that God wou.d suggest to the Sa

The tris> "was undertaken as" the out
come of the chatting of Dr. Jackson by
a party of men in the University Club of
San Francisco one day last May. The
skeptics Insisted that- a transcontinental
trip In ,an automobl'e was an impossi
bility. The doctor asked for Crocker and
told him what the clubmen had said.
Crocker thought tho journey could bo
made, and so the trip besan.
Dr. Jackson left San Francisco on May
23, and struck across the country
toward the east, through Nevada. Utah
and Colorado. In all over 600O miles were
traveled In the sixty-three days of the
Journey. Durins this time thero were
nineteen days in which the cngrlne was
not turned. At one time the tourlata were
thirty-six hours without food.

The reeond coffin was of lead and very

arms of the dead Pope,, with the triple
crown, but without the key?, asthey sig

personally with the arms of the Camer

the Basilica lighted a brazier, which -.was
used in soldering the coffin, producing
When all had been arranged the su
preme prayer was paid and the last bene
diction given, all present joining in. Half
suppressed sobs were heard on all cldes.
SUPREME PRAYER IS SAID.
When the body had been carefully put
into the coffin it was entirely concealed
with the red velvet covering which before
had been on the bier. The major domo
put bwide the body two silk purses con
taining coins of silver and bronzo metal
struck during Leo's pontificate. A eulogy,
written In magnificent Latin and setting
forth the great events of Popo Leo's life
and reign, Inclosed In a metal tube, was
also interred with the body.
The major domo then covered the- ven
crablo features and hands with a white
Bilk veil bordered with gold. Over this
the prefect of ceremonies spread a large
silk veil, which covered tho whole person.
Fire was lighted in a brazier, and,
blown by a bellows, the sparks rising al
most to tho ceiling, while Monsignor Bar
tola.nl read for twenty minutes the Orato
lirevl*. eulogizing the dead Pontiff, and
Notary Poponi. S4 years old, read out the
burial record, a service which he per
formed upon the occasion of the deaths of
Pope Gregory XVI and Pope Plus IX. *
Tnc MbnMgrnors of the Basilica, aided
by the Noble Guard, then laid all that
was mortal of Leo XIII In a cypress cof
fin, lined with red satin and bearing' on
the cover an inlaid cross, the entire
Sacred College and Prince Colonna ris
ing to their feet as a last tribute and
sign of respect.
In the middle of the right side of the
chapel, among the Cardinals, sat -Prince
Mercantanol Colonna, assistant to the
Pontifical throne, with an empty seat
nÂ»>xt him. owing to the fact that Prince
Orsirl, who held the same position, had
resigned.
LAST TRIBUTE TO THE DEAD.
The body was sprinkled with holy wa
ter, absolution was given and the foot of
Lpo XIII was klsed for the last time by
Major Domo Cagiano. Master of the
Chamber Bis'.etti and Count Camlllo
PeccL
The seen** in the chapel was remarkably
effeetivp. The blÂ«Â»r bearing the body was
received by Cardinal Oreglia. It was
placed In the center, backed by an altar
with a beautiful image of the Madonna,
before which were burning four immense
candles in silver staffs. Around the two
sides of the chapel, in the choir seats,
were thirty-six Cardinals, all wearing
violet robes except Cardinals Gotti and
Perottl. who wore the white mantles of
tbe!r orders; Cardinal Martlnelli as an
Aiigustir.!aii. and Cardinal Vives y Tuto
in Franciscan brown. t
In the chapel the music changed to
notes of joy and "In Paridisum" rang out
with telling effect. From the outside the
five bells of St. Peter's rang their accus
tomed salute to the coming night, min
gling harmoniously v.1th the music of the
choir.
After slow progress around tho church
the ea.d cortege arrived at the chapel
choir, the bier being so carried that .the
dead Pope entered head first, according to
the ceremonial; the chapel, from semi
obscurity. flashing into brilliancy with
the suddenly turned on electric light.
Here all those who had received invita
tions were stopped, remaining' in the
main part of the basilica behind a double
line of the Swiss Guards, in their peculiar
yellow, red and black uniforms and
armed with halberds and serpentine
swerds. Within the chapel was XTount
Camillio Pecci, a nephew of the late Pope,
wearing the red uniform of a general of
the castle guard.
JOYOUS MELODY SOUNDS.
St. Peter's is peculiarly iitted to be the
background of such a scene. The cold
whiteness of- her vast pillars showed up
the bright uniforms of the guards, tho
violet robes of the clergy and the bier,
while the flickering light of the candles
made the funeral procession the only visi
ble object and rendered obscurity beyond
and b?hind it more noticeable.
Then to the strains of the "Miseriere,"
which wailed through the lofty church,
and preceded by a glittering cross held
aloft, the procession, carrying candles
and torches, slowly left the chapel and
went up to the church, passing the bronzo
statue, and, beyond, the shrine of St.
Peter.
Cardinal Rampolla, as archprlest of the
basilica, was waiting outside the gates in
violet robes, surrounded by the Chapter
of the Cathedral, which was led by Mon
signor Cepetelli. who conducted the ser
vice. Drs. I^apponi and Mazzoni directed
the work of the removal of the bier,
which was executed, by eight sediari. or
Pope"s carriers, attired in their brilliant
red robe costumes. At first they tried to
raise, the bier, but finding it too heavy,
they slowly slid it on a low car with
noiseless wheels. *
REMOVAL OF THE BIER.
OME. July. 25.â The body of Pope
"B^^ Leo w** Interred in St. Peter's
BL& to-night. The strokes of the
â¬Â»%. hammer, which resounded
through the immense dome of
the cathedral, announced to the earnest
gathering in the nave that Leo XIII had
been laid to rest.
At sundown the most Important and
most solemn of all the obsequies took
place. The front doors of the basilica
were closed . and the vast church, except
for a row of lights at the shrine of St.
Peter, the candles about the bier and those
persons who had gathered quietly and
with the utmost reverence gathered there,
appeared deserted.
About 1000 persons had received invita

WEAR BEATTTIFUL ROBES. .
AMID a scene of religious pomp and
splendor the profound and rare
ceremonies attendant on the con
secration of a Bishop of the
Roman Catholic church were wit
nessed by a large assemblage at St.
Mary's Cathedral yesterday, when the
Rev. Father Libert Hubert Boeynaem3
was ordained Bishop of Zeugma, the ec
clesiastical office formerly held by Arch
bishop Farley of New York.
Probably never before In the history of
the Roman Catholic church has the or
<2!netlon of a Bishop taken place while a
departed Pontiff has, been lying In state,
and probably never before In the annale
of the church has the tame profound and
eolcmn ceremony taken place within a
sacred! edifice draped in crape and show-
Ing every sign,- both Interlorally and ex
terlorally. of mourning.
While the great windows were palled by
immense lengths of somber crape and the
cha-ncel rails and organ gallery were
shrouded with deep black diver bordered
velvet and the great pillars were bidden
with crape from floor to. ceiling, the
myriad of lights from the altar and from
the ehajwls on the right and left afforded
some relief and brightness. - -
The rich robes of the ecclesiastics added
were clothed In cassock, rochet, amice
and stole and red cope, pectoral and
white miter.
Seated just within the craped chancel
rail were twenty-one priests, including
Franciscan monks in their habits, and a
bearded member of the English. Capuchin
province, .together with devout Domini
cans arid Marists. Five Brothers In plain
black robes sat as -though they formed a
council on' the north side of the chancel,
and Vicar General Prendergast at the
south side.' â¢
When all were seated the senlorBlshop,
Bishop Grace, made request that the elect
be promoted -to the burden of the episco
pate and the mandate or brief -sent the
elect by Pope Leo XIII last June was pre
sented to Arjchblshop Montgomery, the
consecrator, by his notary. ~
The coneecrator then proceeded with a
categorical examination of , the Blshop
ekct, who proclaimed his adherence to
the orthodox rites 'of the . Roman Catho
lic church and her teachings. ; ;' .â¢ :
IMPOSING CEREMONIAJL.
The consecrator â¢ then commenced the
mass and the elect, with the assistant
Bishops and attendants, proceeded to the
smaller chapelBouth of the altar,-.wherÂ«
he> laid, aside the cope and put on the
pectoral cross and, girded . on the stole.
He was., also vested -with the tunic, the
,dalmatlc and' chasuble and white -gloves
and white sandale. Â¦' Â¦ . - : - Â¦
The epistle was then read and the elect
was led before the consecrator, who by
this time had put on his miter.
| After a preamble the consecrator, with
the assistance of thp. Bishops, took, the
open book of the gospels and laid it tipon
the neck ..and shoulders >ot. the Bishop
elect. The 'head of' the elect was then
bound with a band of linen, which .office
was performed that the chrism which
Is used for the. anointment of the- head,
might not flow down 'on the, face before
being wiped away by. the assistant Bish
ops. In the same way.' his hands were
anointed and placed In a -linen band,
which was attached to his neck and thus
kept until- cleaned also by the Bishops.
During the anointing of the head the
consecrator made thrice the sign of the
cross over the forehead of the elect, say

SEVERE TRIALS
FOR GREYHOUNDS
Kortljmg of San Francisco County
. ~ Club Stands Well at Head
of Batting List.:. -"" â¢;;
.A team of Pacific cricketers left this
city by the afternoon train yesterday for
Santa Cruz, where they' will meet an
eleven of the Santa Cruz Cricket and
Athletic Club to-day for the, second time
during the present season.
The team which will wear the scarlet
and black consists of H. .C. Casidy (cap
tain). A. W. Wilding. W. PethertckS F.
A. "Bennion. E. H. JM. Lannowe. Dr. O.
N. Taylor, E. T. Langdale. H. N*. Storrs.
.W. B. Kysh, G. S. McCallum and II. O.
Watson.
On Sunday, August 2, the Pacific eleven
will face for the third time during the
present season that formidable aggrega
tion, the San Francisco County team. Of
the four batsmen who stand at the top
of the list for the season three are San
Francisco County men. B. Kortlang has
played in six Innings, been three times
not out, has made a total of 243 runs,
giving an average of S3 runs. H. B. Rich
ardson has been"* seven tiroes at bat,
twice not out, has a total of 3)5 runs, or
an average of 61. E. G. Sloman has been
seven times at bat, twice not out, has a
total of 131 runs, or an average of 26.01.
His usefulness to his club, however, is
not represented by the number of runs
he has made, as in last Sunday's match
against the Alameda Cricket Club he was
at the wickets for one hour and forty
minutes for only 11 runs. - Harold Ward
of the Alameda Club is the only man not
a member of the San Francisco County^
team to have won a place among the four
batsmen at the top. He has been seven
times at bat, twice not out. has a total
of 195 runs, or an average of 39.
In the bowling list three San Francisco
County men stand at the top. E. Peter
sen has bowled 144 balls, capturing 11
j wickets for 51 runs, at an average cost
of 4.07. E. II. "Wilkes has bowled 210
balls, has taken 11 wickets for 66 runs, at
an average cost of 6. B. Kortlang. though
the wickets * taken by him have been a
little more expensive, has really done the
most" service r as a bowler, having sent
-down S37 bails, with which he captured
29 wickets 'for 1S3 runs, at an average
cost of 6.09. The nearest bowler to any
of these three is F. J. Croll of the Ala
meda Club, who has delivered 477 balls,
with which he has taken 18 wickets for
205 runs, at an average cost of 11.05. Har
old "Ward of .the same! club has taken 19
wickets at an average cost of 15 runs and
B. Bird' has 'captured 15 at an average
cost of 12.06 runs. V : l

..Three In a row was the portion of the
Angel baseball gladiators for the series
so far when they had bottled up Uncle's
colts yestej-day at Recreation Park and
sent them away w,ltb.out a run and but
two hits. The Angels amassed a pair,
quite enough to win any battle like this.
The home team was not so much like a
bunch of Red Cross subjects and there
fore put up a battle that had tho real
ring of tight in it all the time. Kelly was
sent to first again and Willie Jacobs, the
San Rafael amateur, performed in the
rear of the plate. He made a hit with
every fan Inside the lot.
The first Angel tally was a gift by
Charley Irwin, who forgot himself long
enough In the second round to allow two
"balls to get away from him, while one of
the enemy wildly scampered to the finish.
The other tally, which arrived during tho
progress of the eighth, was due to three
solid bumps, coming just at the moment
when they were most needed.
Young Jacobs showed he was a game
kid, and furthermore that he knows a
littlcbit about the work behind the plate.
For. his appearance in fast company tho
lad certainly did more than well and won
the good will of tho crowd*by the way ho
tried all the time. His throwing to second
was the feature of the game.
His unerring wing caught Smith, Ross
and Wheeler at second and all by a vAde
margin. These men are the fleetest of
foot on the team. They have been elud
ing the best catchers in the league. all
season, so when they were nailed at the
bag by tho youth the rest of. the Angel
band 'looked wise and attempted no more
steals.
Dr. Newton, the big southpaw with the
breaking curves, was the man who kept
the locals away from the rubber. He had
them on his staff all tho time, and the
way he was pitching it was no effort'for
him to mystify thorn. In the second in
ning Krug and Delrnas hit the Doc safely.
These were the first, last and only binglcs
of the natives.
Whalen was also in the running himself
during the greater part of the engage
ment and had the Angela under ono of
those peculiar spells of his. But in the
eighth they opened up to, him' for three,
and these three happened Just right
for another run and perhaps two Â¦ for
Smith's carelessness In gliding past the
second bag without leaving the imprint
of his foot there.
Dillon-started the second round by slap
ping a hot one down to Irwin, who booted
it.bj3.dly.* Cravath lined the ball to Del
mas and Dillon was forced at eccond.
Ross died by the same process. This sent
Cravath to third. Then Toman walked
and Spies hit to Shay, who fielded the
chance in grand form and threw to Irwin.
Charley let the bail get out of his grasp
and it bounded away while Cravath trip
pedz-to the rubber.
In the same round the home team camo
near breaking up the game, or at least
starting something. Krug hit and Dclmas
hit and they rested on second and third
after the throw in of Del's swat to right.
Two were down and Jacobs was due at
the bat. The trial of being up against
Dr. Newton for his first professional try
out at the bat was too many and be sadly
smote space three times.
3 be Angels, rushed another run over in
'eighth. Hoy beat out a slow one to
short and Wheeler sacrirtced. Smith
scored the dummy when he planted tho
ball in center field. Dillon was not lack
ing y with his usual bingle, but Smith was
careless enough to cut the second. bag in
his mad run over the paths. This prob
ably robbed the southern band of at least
another one. The score:

Rheumatism
* â¢^-> "THE PAIN KING/
Those Tvho have ever felt its keen, cutting pains, or witnessed the intense
suffering of others, know that Rheumatism is torture, and that it J is right-
Jy called â¢â¢ The King of Pain. " .
All do notsuffer alike. Some are suddenly seized with the most excrucia-y
ting pains, and it seems every muscle and joint in the body was being torn
asunder. Others feel only occasional slightpains for weeks ormonths; when
a sudden change in the weather or exposure to damp, chilly winds or night
air brings on a fierce attack, lasting for days perhaps, and leaving the pa-
tient with a weakened constitution or crippled and deformed for all time.
An acid, polluted condition of the blood is the cause of every form and
variety of Rheumatism, Muscular, Articular, Acute, Chronic, Inflammatory
and Sciatic, and the blood must be purged and purified before there is an
end to your aches and pains. External applications, the use of liniments and
plasters, do much toward temporary relief, but such treatment does not reach
the real cause orcleanse the diseasedJjlood ; but S. S. S., the 'greatest of all
blood purifiers and tonics, does cure Rheumatism by antidoting and neutraliz-
ing the poisonous acids and building tip the weak and sluggish blood. It is

Two se\*erc cases of Ovarian Trouble
and two terrible operations avoided. Mrs.
Emmons and Airs. Coleman' each tell
how they were saved by the use of
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
" Dr.vn Mel Pixkiiam : â I am so pleased with the results obtained
from Lydia E. Pixikham's Vegetable Compound that I feel it a duty
and a privilegesto \vrite you about it.
"I suffered for more then five years xnth ovarian troubles, caus-
icj an unpleasant discbarge, a great weakness, and at times a faintness
would come over me which no amount of medicine, diet, or exercise
&eeni2d to correct. Your Vegetable Compound found the weak spot,
however, within a few weeks â and saved me from an operation â
ail my troubles had disappeared, and I found myself once more healthy
and well. Words fail to describe the real, true, grateful feeling that is
in my heart, and I want to tell every sick and suffering sister. Don't
d.jlly with medicines you know nothing about, but take Lydia E. Pink-
!j:Â»m's Vegetable Compound, and take my word for it, you will be a
different woman in a short time."â Mrs. Laura Emmoxs, Walkcr-

It in claimed that the assessment Is
unique. Water, according to Assessor
Dalton, has a value. "This' business of
water being as free aÂ»alr is something
that belongs to the past," he said 'to-day.
"That water out in those lakes ha? a com
mercial value. It is wortb money and you
buy it at so much a gallon. The land It
lies on it not the only thing that Is as
sessable. The water -you bathe In Is
worth money."
The assessment of the Spring Valley
Water Company's properties this year is
W.800.000; last year it was $800,000. Of the
$2,600,000 Increase, $2,000,000 of this amount
is placed on the lakes in Washington and
Pleasant on townships. An assessment of.
IMS.OOO.has been' placed on water 'in the
Contra Costa Water Company's reservoir.
Water in large quantities sometimes
comes high. Two million dollars of the
increase in the assessment of the Spring
Valley Water Company's property in this
county Is placed on the water in the res
ervoir, and according to the figures of
Assessor Dalton the Contra Costa Water
Company has 1945,000 worth of water in

TULARE, July 25.â A south-bound p*J
senger train passed over a broken rail
near Cross Creek to-day and had a nar
row escape from disaster. It is thought
to have been more work of wreckers. The
passengers were considerably shaken up.
Within a week three trains have almost
been wrecked in this vicinity. On Wednes
day and again on Thursday attempts were
made to derail the Fresno-Porterville
flyer by piling rocks and ties, on the track.
The first time the engineer saw the ob
struction In time to stop the train. The
second attempt beins made after dark,
the danger was not known until the en
gine was in the midst of the flying rocks
and Umber,?, the train's speed alone pre
venting a frightful accident.

CALL FOR MEETING.
Following is the call issued to-day for
the August meeting and the signers of
the same:
With the organization of nn Improve
ment association of leading residents and
heavy taxpayers, which, it !Â¦> expected,
will be the result of the meeting on Au
gust 5, and with the assistance of flfly
prominent citirens and property owners,
the City Trustees will have representa
tive bodies from which to gather advice
and information to guide them In the final
action they will take with respect to the
two railroad franchises.
Const rvative residents, while taking but
little stock in the threat of Division Su
p?rintendent B. A. Worthington that if
the Southern Pacific was not granted two
franchises in Alameda on Its own terms
the corporation would dispense with at
feast one local line, the south side road,
look upon the agitation now raging as
detrimental to Alameda. It is their desire
to see the discussion settled as soon as
possible and on terms that will be mu
tually fair to the city and the railtoad
company.
Senator Joseph 11. Knowland, who is
another of the callers of the meeting, be
lieves that such public gatherings at this
time will be productive of benefit to the
city at large. He said :
I Â«as etked one month ajro by David Hirsch
feld It I nxuid be willing to Join an Improve-
BtM club he and others then contemplated or
ganizing. 1 jumeJ my willingness. That was
uriore mere railroad franchises were discuased
at all. 1 presume that the agitation has been
tl.e caure of Issuing the call at this time. There
will in all probability be an association formed
at Ul< int â¢ .ins i" lake an Interest in uffaita
that are at present occupying the attention of
the D*ofÂ»le of Alameda.
KKOWLAND'S OPINION.
Upward of sixteen years ago Alameda
had an improvement association that did
much to auvante the best interests of the
city and lucused public sentiment in many
ways for the Good of Alameda. Some of
those whese names are attached to the
call for the coming meeting were affil
iated with the eld organization. Some of
these nun feel that now there is no con
certed action on the part of those agitat
ing the- matter of the railroad franchises
&nd that as a consequence the city Inter
ests arc suffering.
George K. Plumxner. one of the signers
ot" ihe ca.l to property owners, said:
We must cm Alamrda cut of the rut into
whith it tKi.nt, the city it slldinr. AUraeda

minaVd way. Wo >alkÂ«d of forming an im

cre this a&itaticn was commenced, and if we
i.ad Â»uch Â«in organization now X feel that it

that the outcome of tfce meeting we have called

ALAMEDA, July 'Jbr- Right upon the

for by the Southern Pacific Company

prominent residents fcr a meeting to be
held on tao night of August 5 in the City
Hail â¢'tor the purpose of stimulating
public spurn." It is the latest move on
the part of to get together and
distUEs mati'.rs that are of momentous
importance and is regarded as an out
growth of the railroad franchise agita
tion U:at has been sweeping over the
municipality fcr three weeks.
Alihuiigii those whose names are af
ttxeii to the call for the meeting of prop
erty wntrs assert that preliminary steps
vktre taken over lour weeks ago to organ
ize an improvement club, there is no
couLt expn.st.rd that the present situation

prospect is for a good crop.
In the Wenatchee Valley the fcecond crop of
alfalfa is now being cut. The sugar beet crop

jrrolably the largest crop ever raised in the

This market was firm, with higher futures.
The Chicago letter of Uolton. de Ruyter & Cn.
said: "The market Is etrr.ng end higher. Ca-
I bies are rtlll dull and the cash situation is
j slow. Weather in the Northwest is on the
whole favorable and probably the cut look for
the spring Wheat crop lÂ» somewhat improved.
The Item of news which contributed to the
strength to-day Is the threshlns returns from
Nebraska, which are almost uniformly and dls- I
tlnctly disappointing. It occasioned a good i!*hI '

â¢ Ing liberal world's' shipments on Monday an'd

! Klan Wheat. It being Saturday the cash mtr
j ket was quiet. We see no reason to change
i our previous views, which are that Wheat Ib
: worth the money, and when any material

prices were maintained.' Onions, too, were in
I light receipt and choice offerings moved off
I well, sales of Email 'parcels being reported at
70o per ctl.
The Vegetable market was active, owing to
the additional demand 'among retailers for the
Sunday trade.; Green - Corn was -^teady and
prices of crates had a narrower range. Peas,
Abparagus and Lima Beans were' still in limit
ed supply and- met with quick sale at steady
prices. There were heavy receipts 6f Toma
toes, mcstly green stock, and there was a
sharp drop in prices. Egg Plant and Green
Okra were in moderate receipt and unchanged.
Cucumbers, Summer Squash and Green Peppers
j were lower under heavy receipts and there
I was quite a surplus unsold at the close of busl
{ ness. String Beans of good quality were in
{ fair request and steady,' while poor stock was
abundant and moved slowly. ...

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO. July 25. â Wheat was quiet and !
uninteresting until late in the (session, with
prices lower at the start. September being oft
\i,v to Vic at 73J4c to 7Cc. Reports of hot â¢
winds in the Northwest and disappointing â¢
threshing reports besan to come In. however,
jind fcborts started to cover. They goon had
September up to 76',-i<&7O%c, where a break
occurred. It was only temi>orary, and when
corn develoued still greater strenath the ad
vance continued to 77 Ho, where it eased off a
trifle -ind clcaed firm at 77Â©77%c, a net Bain
of Ti&lc. There was a little better demand
from commission houses and St. Louis bought
freely.
Corn made the pace for other grains and held
much of the interest of th#Â» trade. Trading
Â»aÂ« excited, due to hot weather damage re
port*, those from the West being especially
dUcouraglng. Oklahoma had hot winds mill .
Kanftsn needs rain, with no moisture anywhere
in the corn belt.. Traders sold long corn eariy
without affectlnr the price to any larce ex
tent and later a heavy demand developed and
held until the close. Trade was on a large
scale and the buying was participated In by
shorts, outsiders and large private speculator*.
September closed strong at the top at 62 lie, a
gain' of H*c, having cold up from 50Â»,ie. ' 1
Oat* followed the -leader* from the opening, '
but' therii was little enthusiasm- manifested.
The market wm not broad at any time, al
though tnere was some increase in outsloe
business. Ttade, wa> largely local and the
market mildly bullish on the corn situation."
September closed with a gain of %c at 33%c.
Local liquidation caused the weakness in pro
visions.', The hog market and heaviness of re
ceipt* apparently Induced the selling. .Closing
figures were near the bottom and the, market'
lacked feature. â¢ September pork' was â¢Â¦ dowa

The French bark Brlzeux. which mad* port
on Friday, was chartered prior to arrival for
wheat for Europe at 21s. 3d, and the German
ship Slam, now due at this port, has been re
chartered for barley to Europe at 16Â« 9d. â¢
The French bark AllcÂ» has been rechar
tered for wheat and barley to Europe at 12s ad.
The low rate Is accounted for by the fact that
the vessel- was chartered Under peculiar condi
tions. By the terms of the charter party one
fourth of the cargo must be wheat, and aa the
vessel carries 3200 tons. 800 tons of wheat are
required. There Is a clause in the charter
party giving the owners the right to carry
ore or other dead weight cargo for ballast, and
In this instance the wheat was considered as
ballast and no freight was figured thereon. The
present going rate for barley to tbÂ« United
Kingdom is 16s 90. The wheat space of the
Alice being deducted, the balance of the space
was let at the rate of 16s 9d for the whole,
which actually reduced the figure to 12s "J,
or 2d lesÂ» than the rate accepted.

sugar from Honolulu to New York.

PHILADELPHIA, July 25.â In the pres
ence of a distinguished gatherfng of dip
lomats, foreign and American naval' offi
cers and prpmln'eqt chlaens of Philadel
phia, the Turkish cruiser Medjidia. the
first warship ever built here {or the Otto
man ' empire, was launched to-day . at
Cramps' Â¦ shipyard. The sponser 1 for the
new ship was Mrs. Edwin S. Cramp, and
the 'baptism was an- evasion of the Ko
ran's teachings, turned into a graceful
compliment to the American people. The
Koran forbids a Turkish woman partici
pating In a .christening, at. which wine is
used. The difficulty was overcome by the
selection of an' American womkn, MVs.
Cramp, to break the bottle on the bow of
the seaflghter. . . â¢ . t Â»
In 1900 Ahmed Pasha, chief engineer of
the Ottoman navy, came to this country
to examine the American system of naval
construction. As. a result of his investi
gation the Turkish Government contract
ed with the Cramps Shipbuilding Com
pany for the construction of the Jtfedjldla,
which is of the protected cruiser type.

"We got away from our American dra

I then asked. >.*: * .
"You must permit me. to praise also,"
the manager Insisted: "Your stock com

dramatic development here. You have so
many, and they do such amazingly good
work. They are of the most hopeful signs
of the times. I wentin the other night

I did not agree as to. the material, but
was pleased when the manager

â¢I love best the man with the spear," I
smile. â¢
"I'm bound to say the soldiers strike me
as being the worst," Mr. Greet said.
Then continued: "They all look as if they
wish <hey were not there, as If they
wanted to be in bed." You ought to have
herÂ©* a set of people with the artistic in
stinct, willing Â¦ to acquire their first ex

â¢ from which could be recruited the actors
oTtne future. Our worst supersâ we call
them Adelphlsâ are absolute' Irvlngs to
most of yours," butthe tolerant, genial
tone and soporific voice stole most of the
Greet thunder.
> Â¦" x ou must like our ; fashion H of taking
.on: our hats in the theater here?" I hum
bly inquire.
} "YeS." Mr. Greet assented, ."but not.
your ; fashion of putting th^m on Â¦ again
before the final curtain." Frankly, I think
it'a hideous practice. to get up and fidget
during the final "ecenesâ don't , you?"
"I'm seldom there," I shy, then ask:;
"uid George Alexander succeed In getting.

you remember hV announced that no one
vrould: be admitted after the curtain went
up until the first act ..was ; over?" ,
"It was a perfect success. Everybody
was at the height of its popularity. It
was the 'Hamlet' of the day."
"It reminds very much of Bunyan's
â¢Pilgrim's Progress'?"
"There Is no doubt that Bunyan got his
inspiration from 'Everyman,' " Mr. Greet
assented. "It is very reasonably conjec
tured, too, that Holbein's 'Dance of Death*
was inspired by the play. Oh, its history
gees back to the eleventh century, as tÂ»r
as It can be traced."
â¢â¢The play seems to have made a ro
rrarkable Impression In the twentieth cen
tury," I suggest.
"It is really a heart-searching, moving
affair," the play's director testified, as to
a creed. "Archbishop Ryan of Philadel
phia said of itâ I had this from a friend
of his, and think I have It correctlyâ 'I
have preached many sermons, heard
many, but never one to equal this.' "
While I was wondering about art for a
sermon's sake Mr. Greet went on: "The
play is naturally more Catholic In atmos
phere than anything else, but It has so
much real humanity, so much of the ab
solute teachings of the gospel, that It has
won admirers of all sects."
"You represent God himself in the play,
do you not?"
"Not always, but generally," the direct
or replied. Then: "Which way would
California like the play best?" '
I gave It up, remembering how James
O'Neillâ truly, some years agoâ was ar
rested every night after the performance
at Morocco's for impersonating the Christ
In Henry de Mllle's "Passion Play."
"You see we have a person called a cen
sor in England," Mr. Greet, gently satiric,
explained^
"Mr. Ablngdon says he Is all right," I
quoted.
"So he isâ for the English," the manager
smiled. "But there Is a -prejudice over
there against representing the Deity on
the sta^e." â¢
"As to the censor's other functions, do
you think him at all useful?" "
"I'm not fond of the so-called moral
playâ 'Zaza.* for example," Mr." Greet
owned. "I've looked at 'Zaza' fr<5m
every side, wondering largely how Clem
ent Scott could hold it up for years as 'a
'moral* play. I mid nothing but an odious
tissue of abominations. The so-called
'problem' play does not Invite."
Then as I stood up to take reluctant
leave, he concluded, "I 'have just discover

laughed, "the first thing I saw here was

similar conditions these to the Elizabeth

"We are to have an open air production
of 'As You Like It, next Saturday," I
remarked, "with Nance O'Nell." ;
"Yes." Mr. Greet said simply. "And we
have given altogether more than 2000 open
air ; performances in England. We have
given 'As You Like It' at Wilton, Lord
Pembroke's place, where the comedy was
first performedâ with Shakespeare acting
Adam." '

besides."
"I see you cleared 110,000 by your open

irrelevantly, "of your giving 'As You

I laughed dlssentlngly: "Of all others I
should judge her morals least' open' to
question. But your censor agrJnâ he ob
jects to Bernard Shaw. You do not?"
. "Shaw's a delicious person," the . man
ager smiled. "Have you ever heard him
lecture on Shakespeare? It's impossibly
funny. No, I think Shaw has achieved;
all but a masterpiece In his 'Candida.'
Any national theater we may, have would
be bound to Include at least one of his
plays In Its repertoire."
"We are to have 'The Devil's Disciple"
here this season," I inform Mr. Greet
with some pride.
"Of course you are. You have every
thing here," he retorted. There is some
thing of the amusement," wonder, jealousy,
doubt, tenderness of the father who finds'
his child free of leading-strings, in tho
Englishman's attitude to the American
stage. Then, seriously, "There Is nothing
more like London-^or, rather,' Londonersâ
than San Franciscans, it appears to me. I
have seen more men' In one club here
with mustaches"â "moustahshes," " Mr.
Greet calls themâ "than In:, any : other

and actors wear shaven faces" with us." .
"Does the resemblance stop at theimus
tache?"I Inquire. : ' _ : '
"Oh. no. But perhaps they would resent
the idea? No? You. are like English peo

the manager tnen catalogued.
"Aren't the women taller here?"âa

"I think not. Our court women are all
"Sometimes it seems that way," Mr.
Greet mused.- "When Rejane, for exam

"There Is your condemned 'personal

"But the bad in art is immoral," the
manager " went on unheeding. Then he
gently thundered: "When I see an ugly
woman wearing a pink hat, a red waist
and a magenta skirt that's an Immoral
woman to me."
"Then you don't like Ibsen?"
I "Oh, yes; I do," Mr. Greet contradicted.
"Ibsen is a brilliant writer, knows how-to
say things and makes actorsâ a great art
âand, above all, actresses."
"Then does It stand that only the bad in
art Is immoral?"

Jnbeter," Mr. Greet slyly put it. . ' Â¦-.'Â»
But perhaps "Ben" Greetâ even Froh
ma_n "presents" him (as director of
"Everyman") without the punctilious
periodâ needs introduction here. In Amer
ica at the present moment we are chiefly
cognizant of Mr. Greet"* existence as dl
' rector of "Everyman," the morality play
that M-ems to have made so profound
iTrrrcFsion upon Eastern audiences last
reason; with an eye also to a significant
production of "As You Like It." in which
the Elizabethan StKge Societyâ Mr.
CJreet's company, cut a new notch In open
â¢â¢air records. But besides being this, the
manager Is many # other things that in
Â¦tereet. He Is a concscente among con
oscenti of the Elizabethan drama. He Is
an actor of accomplishment and also the
manager of a trifle of twelve theatrical
- companies In England. He is. above all,
a manager of deeply artistic instinct,
bigh purpese and commanding judgment.
Therefore, when I learned that Mr. Greet
wes in town, I hastened to "nail" him
to s.n interview.
A courteous note granted my request
for a chat upon the Elizabethan drama.
and in Mr. Ablngdon"s "operating room."
the Palace salon, Mr. Greet met us. We
made for a quiet corner, and the manager,
with the absent-mindedness of genius, be
gan by trying to hang up his hat on the
jjaira that backed his chair. It off,
naturally, and in the laugh that Ifllowed
we became frknds. At least I d.\l.
The first impression one gets of Mr.
Gr< et is a peculiar and pervading square
ners. Hi.* head is squarely built, with
hair squarely partf-d ever a square brow.
He has a strong, square Jaw. and level
brows set over clear, ketn eyes whose
KlftBoe also is sturdily "square." His
rcouth, too, that turns mither up nor
â¢'own. adds another to the straight lines,
and even the shoes are totd with anxious,
humorous squareness. For the rest, his
coloring is of the typical fresh, florid,
Ktigiish type, with eyes of a blue too
precious to be wasted upon a mere man,
and blackish hair â obstinate hair â paint
ed thinly with gray. His broad thc-uld
ers have the hint of the burden of twelve
theatrical companies about them, but
there Is nothing else to remind of these,
Mr. Greet possessing almost the leisurely
r< nosefulncss of manner, the gentle pla
cidity of a Hindu at his devotions.
"But I am net here to teach." Mr.
Greet said, after a little more talk of the
relative values of the "lobster" and itÂ»
â¢trimmings," "I'm here to learn. Why.
you people have done everything. Here
is your Stanford University picking out
a thing like 'The Knight of the Burning
Pestle" for production. Most extraordin
ary. The 'Antigone' of course is the usual
thing, but to dig out a play like the
Beaumont and Fletcher â capitally done,
too, I hear It wasâ that is a very, very
uncommon sort of thing to do. But
I find here a much stronger interest in
the drama than with us. In Harvard,
for example, there is even a professorâ
Professor Bakerâ who concerns himself
wholly with drarr.a-iic literature. They
have at ilavard productions of all kinds
of plays, French, German, Spanish, and
60 on. â¢ â¢ â¢ No, it is difficult to find
anything you Americans have not done. I
am in California myself now because I
'h^ard that some one was going to bnnjj
j'.n 'Everyman' here, and I thought it
. v:ser to be the first."
"We really are going to have 'Every
man'?" I askrd eagerly, for the morality
play Is something I have blackly envied
the East for a whole season.
"In September next 1 am hoping," the
manager replied; "if not, then In the fol
lowing April."
"You are to give the play at the Univer
sity of California I hear?"
"And as many other places as we can,"
he added. "They are very desirous of
having the play at Berkeley. We have
i!r< tcy given it at many of the Eastern
universities, you know."
"They arc very proud of their theater
over in Berkeley," I add.
"Yes. I went over to see it the other
riay. Fascinating idea, that large am
phitheater. President Wheeler is very en
thusiastic about itâ would have me go
over to see it. And truly, it is magnifi
cent. â¢ â¢ â¢ California is surely going to
have its own drama, soon," he unex
pectedly concluded.
"I hope end believe so," 1 replied. "We
are so far eff from the base of supplies,
that we have to be self-supporting, or
suffer. We've suffered up to now. Still,
we cet the crumbs from New York's
table in the summer, and there have been
more than usual this year. Let us be
thankful. â¢ â¢ â¢ But what do you think
the chances are for the American na
tional drama, whether from the West or
the East?"
"I am a visitorâ here practically on suf
ferance." Mr. Greet hesitated, "I hardly
likeâ M
"But that Is precisely what we need,
honest and able criticism." I Insisted.
"I should say then that the practice of
writing for stars is Impeding the progress
of the drama more than any other one
thing." our English critic squarely
avowed. "It cribs, cabins and confines the
writer. In the end, also. It limits the
Hctors. And certainly dramatic art suf
fers from the imposing of the idea of a
personality as the central interest of a
P'.ay. Can you imagine Shakespeare guHty
of writing for a star? Can you fancy
'Hamlet' written to fit? Or 'Cleopatra'
<-ut to any one's measure? You may call
Hamlet a star part, perhaps, yet there are
several almost as good In the play. But
you are fond of the 'star* suggestion here
âeven to the national flag. You have star
politician*, star clergymen, star prize
fightersâwhy not the star actor? But
that is not the way to get the best out of
the drama," all this In the mildly ironic
tone, the sweet English drawl, with which
Sir. Greet at once soothes and hypnotizes
the attention.
He went on again, throwing back his
.licad with a square, characteristic fling:
â¢/This play of ours. 'Everyman.' was
tot written for a s/ar. We even omit the
r.amee of th# players from the programme
âan old custom of the Elizabethan Stage
Society."
Among tire company supporting the
stars are Miss Martha Waldron, Miss
Kate Patterson Selten, Miss * Mary
Wright. Herbert Titheredge. Morton Sel
tcn, R. Lewi3 and Frank Hitchcock.
While it has not yet been decided which
is to be the opening play of the engage
ment, advices are to hand concerning the
repertoire of the organization together
with some particulars of the personnel of
the supporting conjpany.
The plays to be presented are George
Bernard Shaw's brilliant comedy. "The
Devirs Disciple"; Richard Harding
Davis' comedy, "The Taming df Helen";
a new play from the French, "The Lady
of Lyons." and an important production
of "Camille," in which it may be remem
bered Miss Anglin scored so great a tri
umph here last summer. It will thus be
conceived that with a generous repertoire,
and so varied, a great artistic treat is in
store.' 3pÂ£$Sj
The importance of the approaching visit
of the two brilliant stars. Henry, Miller
and Margaret Anglin, in conjunction un
der the direction of Charles B. Dilllnfr
ham, cannot be gainsaid. In view of their
great personal and artistic popularity.
San Francisans have come to regard Hen
ry Miller and Margaret Anglin .with a
sentiment somewhat removed from the
mere cursory appreciation of their re
spective brilliant talents, and now that
their names are announced jointly- on the
same bill their innumerable admirers
have cause for double rejoicing. The
opening date of the attraction at the Co
lumbia Theater is set for Monday, August
17. and their stay will continue over sev
eral weeks.
Jameson Lee Finney is an Americanâ
a native of one of the Western States.
He* is thoroughly and enthusiastically
American Jn all his tastes and habits. Yet
it must be chronicled as a remarkable
fact that In all his stage experience Mr.
Finney has never played an American
until he essayed the part of Percy Merrill
in "A Fool and His Money" at the Madi
son Square Theater. At the Empire The
ater Mr. Finney appeared in the follow
ing roles: Captain La Holies In "Under
the Red- Robe" (French); Lieutenant
Schneider In "The Conquerors" (German);
a Frenchman in "Bohemia," an English
man in "John A'Dreams." At Daly's
Mr. Finney played Lord Huntworth In
"Lady Huntworth's Experiment" (En
glish): Lord Cyril Garston in "Frocks and
Frills" (English); Modus in "The Hunch
back"; Gringolre in "Notre Dame"; an
Englishman in "The New Clown," and
a Frenchman in "The Two Schools." Mr.
Finney is proud of the fact that his great
est hit was made in the part of the debon

The automobile tournament will be the

Interesting happenings. E. Courtney-
