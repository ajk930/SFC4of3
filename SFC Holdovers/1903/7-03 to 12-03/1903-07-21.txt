VOLUME XCIV-NO. 51.
Pontiff W hose Long^d
his haughty and austere bearing.
He is not popular among his col
leagues or the Romans, and his
brusque manner has earned him
the title of "the Piedmont bear."
He is tall and robust and his 74
years are shown by the whiteness
of his hair. His face has the tawny
hue of old parchment and is deep
ly lined. Despite his austerity the
Cardinals learning and piety are
recognised. .
This is' the man who for the
time being is practically Pope. It
was he who issued the order to
clear the Vatican from intruders
and brought tranquillity out of the
confusion immediately following
Pope Leo's death.
The greatest interest is nov>
centered in the work of the holy
conclave, which is to select the
successor to Leo XIII. The con
clave ivill, it is generally believed,
meet on August 3- Speculation,
prophecies and predictions conic
from every direction in favor of
the various candidates. The com
paratively long illness of Leo has
had the effect of narrowing the
chances of some who entered the
contest with what zvas thought to
be the brightest prospects, while it
has brought forward the promi
nence of others who at first icerc
hardly considered. The result is
that they are all now on about
the same level. It is said that
there has never . been a con
clave in zvhich there arc so many
candidates zvho have a fair" chance
of winning.
Such a situation might lead to a
than a week ago. His first or
der was that all entrances to
the Vatican be closed and all per
sons dismissed from the death
chamber. The body of the Pon
tiff zvas placed in charge of Fran
ciscan monks.
The Cardinal is the exact an
tithesis of Pope Leo, having none
of the late Pontiff's sympathetic
and benevolent characteristics.
He comes of noble Piedmontese
stock and his nobility is shown in

Oreglia, the dean of the Sacred

Pope Leo's final moments were
marked by that same serenity and
dcz'otion, and. when he was con
scious, that calm intelligence
which is associated with his twen
ty-five years' pontificate. His
was no easy death. An hour bc^
fore he died, turning to Dr. Lap
poni and his devoted valet, Pio
The period of tivo weeks or
more that Pope Leo passed in the
shadow of death was no less won
derful than his life. His splendid
battle against disease was watched
the world over with sympathetic
admiration and ended after tre
mendous efforts to conquer the
weakness of his aged frame by the
marvelous power of his mind.
The plcitro-pncumonia with which
his Holiness has been suffering
was scarcely as responsible for his
death as that incz'ifable decay of
tissue which ensues upon ninety
three years of life.
To-night the lifeless frame
which held so brave a spirit lies on
the bed in the Vatican beside
which almost all the world lias
prayed. The red damask coverlet
rests lightly over the body, the
Cardinal's scarlet cape is about
the shoulders, while on his head
has been placed the papal hood of
velvet, bordered with ermine. A
white silk handkerchief is bound
about his chin, and in the hands
that have blessed so many thou
sands Jiavc been placed a crucifix.
So Pope Leo will remain until to
morrow, watched by uniformed
officers of the Noble Guard and
rough-clad Franciscan peniten
tiaries, W'ho, will keep a ceaseless
zigil until the burial ceremonies.
To-morrow the Sacred College
of Cardinals will assemble for the
official duty of pronouncing Pope
Leo dead. After this sad fun'c*
tion has been performed the body
will be taken to the small throne
room adjacent to the death cliam
bcr, where it will be. embalmed.
The funeral ceremonies will ex
tend over nine days, the remains
being removed to the Cathedral
cf St. Peter's, where they will lie
in state. The ultimate resting
place of the dead Pontiff will be in
the magnificent Basilica of St.
John Latcran.

As. senior member of the Sacred College,"
Cardinal Oreglla, to whom the Pope to
day solemnly confided the interests of the
church, had' now become the exponent of
the Cardinals until Pope Leo's successor
shall have been elected. .

i.' Of "the- supreme, moment Dr. ; Lapponi
gives an impressive description.- He says:
"Death occurred: through exhaustion,
although In the last two hours Pope Leo
made a supreme effort to gather together
all his energies. He succeeded In recog
nizing those about him, by v the sound of
their voices, . as his 'sight was almost en
tirely lost. . Still, he , made a marvelous
display of .his energy, and even his death
was really grand. It was- resigned, calm
and serene. Very : few examples ' can be

supreme courage in dying. The Pontiff's

minutes after A o'clock.

'Â¦ Only the most . general funeral arrange

Just at that moment a large party of
American tourists, unaware of the critical
situation 'of the Pontiff, ascended s the
grand staircase, talking and laughing.
They were approached by a gendarme who
said : - â¢ t .-.,.....
"Please do not make any* noise, as the
Holy Father is dying." *? [<
This produced great emotion among the
tourists and they immediately retired.
This morning the sick room was the
most tranquil spot In the Vatican. -The
Pontiff lay on his bed. the pillows of
which were not whiter than his face. His
hands were folded over the rosary, which
he had used for over fifty, years. The
famous armchair stood invitingly near,
with his stick beside It. while Centra, his
valet, prayed and wept before a huge
Ivory crucifix. Dr. Lapponl sitting by the
bedside, ready for any emergency. . The
doctor from time to time arose to ad
minister nourishment. Dr. Lapponl suc
ceeded In having the patient swallow
several spoonfuls of coffee, milk and
brandy mixed. ,The silence of the filck
room was occasionally broken by a hack
ing cough, due to the gathering of phlegm
in the Pope's throat. | These' coughing
spells had the effect of arousing the Pon
tiff, causing him to open his eyes and re
vive slightly. When the doctors were ex
amining him this morning, believing he
was In a stupor, his Holiness suddenly
fixed his eyes, even then bright and. by no
means lifeless, on them, saying:
"This time, doctors, you will not win
In your brave fight with death."
"It is your Holiness who, Is brave,", re
plied Dr. Lapponl. but before the remark
was uttered the Pope was again unable
to understand what was said.
The Pope continued now^and then to
mutter phrases, although unconscious.
His mind evidently returned to the events
which impressed him. most .before his ill
ness began. At one moment he was <eel
ing about with his hand and moving his
head from side to side, trying to lift him
6elf, while he murmured:
"What crowds! What devotion! My
dear people â -"
vThen, falling back, he sighed and said:
"Oh. the weight of these robes. Can I
hold out until the end?" / â¢
This was followed by scraps of Latin
verse and prayers, nnd then' .came an
interval of silence which was broken by
another moment of energy in which the
Pope crif.d: . .
Â¦ "The consistory, is over.. They can re
proach me no longer. How many faces of
all â¢ kinds! How many foreigners! -.The
church is triumphing." and so v on 'over
and over again.
A wonderful thing about Pope; Leo .was
that everv time, his mind became clear
he seemed to grasp the. fact that It might
be the last and made the hfshest use
of it. Wnen; during, the alarming crisis
about noon, he was lying on his bed, 'per
fectly motionless, while around -him .-knelt
the Cardinals and other, memuers of the
papal court praying and not certain the
Pope was ' not already 'dead ""without' any
preliminary restlessness the Pontiff;open

solemnly: / , .

Then Mgr. Bcslettl. the master of the

To-morrow morning the recognition of

afternoon Dr. Lapponi will have the body
carried Into the adjoining room, called tne
"little throne room," where Pope Leo re
cently received King- Edward and Em

Monslgnor Gasparie, who. It Is said,
will be designated by Cardinal Oreglla
to _ succeed the late Monsignor Volplni
as 'secretary of the "consistory, served as
secretary of the special commission of
Cardinals appointed to deal with the
Philippine question. In this capacity he
took a prominent part in the negotiations
with the Taft commission In Rome last
year.
The changa within the- Vatican affects
practically "all of the officials, from the
highest to the lowest. Cardinal Rampoila
retires from the post of secretary of state,
where he Â¦. exercised a strong Influence
owing to the physical infirmities of Leo.
Other high officials are. similarly affected.
These, however, will continue to exercise
their functions until the i new Pope is
elected, when he will designate his own
officials: to .carry, on the various Im
portant branches of the church's work.
Thus there 13 a complete transformation
of apostolic authority. The propaganda
atone remains Intact.
The chief International questions that
may.be affected by the death of the Pope
are those connected with the suppression
of religious orders In France, the change
o! the clergy In the new Spanish-Ameri
can , colonies, the successor of the lat%
Cardinal Vaughan and attendant ques
tions 'connected with the administration
of the church In England.
- Among Vatican officials the Philippine
question, Involving transfers from the
Spanish to; the American heirarchy and
the elimination of the friars. Is regarded
as one of the most Important. The pres
ent Philippine policy had the hearty ap
proval of Leo XIII and there Is no reason
to believe that It will be changed. -
The relations between the Italian Gov
ernment and the Vatican continue to be
serious problems. Although the tempeVal
authority of the papacy terminated eight
years before Leo XIII became Pope, He
steadfastly maintained the principle of

Sceciaf Dispatch to Th$ CalL
The death chamber preserved much the
sime appesrance at it did at the time of
tbe final Illness of the Pupe. It Is sit
uated* on the third floor of the Vatican;
the apartments fronting the splendid pi
azza-of 6t â¢ Peter's, -and the window of
the rootr. commanding a view of the tall
obelisk and'hlaylng fountains, with Rome
In the Death Chamber.
This was the signal for an outburst of
tears and the sound or weeping which
could no longer be suppressed, all of the
kneejing prelates and others kissing the
dead handâ that hand which had dispens
ed so many benedictions and charities.
Outside the death chamber expectation
was Intense, but the fight of the sorrow
ing faces of those leaving the room was
sufficient, without words, to spread the
Fad news, which was not long In traveling
throughout Rome.
The occurrences In the death chamber
Immediately following the Pope's demise
were of impressive solemnity. Couriers
had been dispatched to summon those
who are delegated to perform the first
religious offices of- the. dead Pope, and
eocn the chanting of the^ Franciscan
monks was heard, as. two by two, in
ecarsc. brown habits and with sandaled
feet, they approached the room in which
Leo lay dead. From time Immemorial
the Franciscans have been penitentiaries
of St. Peter's. Following, them came the
roble guard to watch over the Pontiff's
remains, the brilliancy of their uniforms
contrasting with the Bomber attire of the
quaintly garbed monks and the solemn
dignity of the chamber Itself. The. only
eound heard was the measured chanting
of tpe Psalms of Penitence by. a group of
monks, kneeling beeide the couch of
death. Two noble, guards took up .posi
tions'at the foot of the couch and stood
by, rigid and client as statues, . with
swords drawn and reversed pointing; to
the floor.
Give Way to Grief
The last conscious act of the Pontiff
was to turn hia eyes toward the great
crucifix on the wall, after which he suf
fered from a paroxysm of choking, during
which he nassed away. . *
Then the silence of the awe-struck as
semblage was brok-m by the sonorous,
solemn voice of Cardinal Vannutrlll, the
grand penitentiary, intoning, the Requiem
Aeternum (rest eternal).
Dr. Lapponi, who almost constantly had
his finsers on the Pope's pulse, felt it
growing gradually weaker and weaker,
and at the same time the Pontiff's ex
tremities began to get cold, his lips be
came black, his eyes sank more deeply
Into the head, his breathing became even
more difficult and there were strange rat
tlings in his throat.
Finally the Pope was asked to bless his
nephews ar.d all the others present^ He
attempted to raise himself and the ex
treme emaciation of his person was ren
dered more pronounced by the surround
ings.
It was a solemn momentâ the head of
the Pontiff, with Us white skullcap, no
whiter than the fringe of the Bilvery hair,
rising above the crimson coverlet, his
hand raised in the familiar gesture of.
benediction, the kneeling assemblage be
ing too earnestly absorbed in deep afflic
tion, vf-neraticn and weeping to even
make a movement.
The doctors a pain examined the dying
holy tether, and this time found that
he was -at the extreme limit of his pow
ers and respiration. His eyes began to
become dull and clouded, and Leo XIII
entered Into the real agony of 'death.
which was recognized by- all present
kneeling.
Then the dying Pope murmured some
thing to himself and those bending' over
him heard the words, "Father" and
"Mother." . 'Â¦'.'..
Murmurs Last Words.
Profound silence reigned in the Pope's
bedroom, broken only by the doctors ris
ing to render their expiring patient more
comfortable, by the sobs of the ever
faithful valet. Pio Centra, or the mur
mured prayers of Mgr. Pilferi. the papal
confessor, himself S4 years of age, who
had to be assisted to the bedside. Softly
he recited the prayers for the dying, the
Pontiff at one moment appearing to fol
low them as though conscious of what
was transpiring^ but he could not speak.
"2^ OME. Julv 2O.-The Pope died
MJa shortly after 4 o'clock this aft-
Jm^ ernoon. His last moments were
â¢ comparatively peaceful and pain
less and were preceded by a pe
riod of insensibility. Around the bedside
Â«t the final moment were the Cardinals,
ihe relatives ar.d the members of the pa
pal court. Before lapsing into uncon
sciousness the dyir.fi Pontiff feebly moved
his Hds, his last articulate words being
those used in bestowing a benediction. .
Gradually the shadow of death spread
over the Pontiff, his extremities became
cold, his features assumed the fixed rigid
ity of death, and Dr. Lapponl noted his
last fluttering heart beats, which grad
ually became slower and slower until
they finally stooped.
The final ecene In the death chamber
was profoundly impressive. The Pope's

woris of affection and devotion.
There is no other pest of honor and duty so
elevated, so sublime as the Roman pontificate,
the treasury of centuries of Inspirations, the
world-chair of moral authority ruling direct
two hundred and fifty millions, of every tribe
and every nation, ruling Indirectly by the silent
prestige of its powec, by the vast spiritual force
of its life, and teachings, entire humanity. Into
that pontificate he entered and reigned a quar
ter of a century, leaving posterity to say. as
he closes the last pages of his record, that In
him the Catholic church has had one of the
greatest wonders of her. wondrous sovereigns
and humanity one of its noblest thinkers and
highest exemplars of fidelity to God-given duty.
All humanity has been benefited by him. He
never hesitated to reach-out beyend the formal
confines of the church to Â«erve humanity, to
serve nations and men, who were not of the
fold of .the church.
One of the most meaningful of the acts of
Leo was his announcement to the Catholics of
France that It was their moral duty to adhere
to the> republic and the doctrinal teachings re
garding modern ideas and forms of government
Involved in that announcement. It was, too, a
masterful stroke of diplomacy. All the Catho
lics of France did not follow Leo. Their.po
litical traditions held the field; to-day they
are suffering from their short-sighted conserv
atism and their disobedience toward Leo.
No other man reigned at the dawn of the
twentieth century as Leo reigned. It was
aupreme triumph of moral power â the triumph
of truth and of Justice, the triumph of a soul
replenished with truth and Justice. With Leo

Said he to a Bishop from America one day:
"Oh, America! It is the future.';
Leo's 1 clear view Â¦. of things has endeared

like Leo understood America â its possibilities

Nothing in the circumstances connected with

of the present age has to-day closed its bril

No question that concerned the betterment of
humanity was left untouched by him. His ut

Churchmen Write
of the Pope's
Career.
While the great Pontiffs remains are await
ing their final resting place It Is fitting that
we should pay this tribute of devotion to his
memory, for he was "a man of resource and
our father In his generation." In. the annals
of history he will live as a scholar, a states
man, a philanthropist and a giant among great
leaders of men. The true Christian will further
honor him for that "the Lord gave him
priesthood of nation and made him blessed In
glory." In life he was known as "lumen in
coelo" â the light given of heaven to lead men
home to the heart of God. In death we cherish
the thought that "they that are learned shall
chine as the brightness of the firmament, and
they that Instruct many unto Justice, as the
stars to all eternity."
Leo XIII is dead. The voice which
filled the earth Is silent; the lips which dis
persed knowledge to nations are sealed; the
heart which sympathized with all that was
highest and holiest In aspirations and hopes of
men has been touched unto stillness, and hand*
which but yesterday were freighted with power
and blesElng are to-day cold and lifeless. As
a Catholic he was the vlcy of Christ upon
earth, the mouthpiece of tne most high God.
Those who acknowledged him not for their
shepherd must recognize his genius and the
example of his noble life. He has been sum
moned to rest for his labors. His works follow
him to bespeak a crown of Justice; they remain
as a. heritage for the admiration and imitation
of generations to come.
The pontificate Just brought to a close has
been very nearly associated with the progress,
of the Catholic church in the United btates,
for It was Leo XIII who convened In V}^nary
council the heirarchy and clergy to deliberate
upon the perfecting of the church organization
in this country. The enactments of the coun
cil, which closed its session on Sunday, De
cember 0, 18H4, were in due time approved by
his holiness and they constitute to-day the
standard of discipline .throughout the republic.
Not tbe least important result of this Illus
trious gathering was the demonstration of the
fathers, with the sanction of Rome, to provide
for the more comprehensive education of both
clergy and laity. The savereign Pontiff entered
heart and soul Into the project, which was at
once so neceesary and so congenial to his na
ture and previous training. He had himself
elaborated a scheme which was to come up for
discucsion. The present Catholic University of
America, situated, at Washington, is the con
crete expression of -the counsels, hope 'and
enduring pledge of -Leo's affection for the
United States.

Pontiff ought to be free. So
matter what tbe extent of ter
ritoryâwhether much or lit
tle It should be evident to
every government on earth
that the Pope should not be
the subject of any govern
ment.'
This is a moment when the
attention of the world Is cen
tered on the great part the
Papacy plays and must play In
the world, because- Its spirit
ual headship Is not bounded, by
any geographical .line. If the
rulers of the 'nations truly
desire the welfare of all their
citizens, let them take thought
at this moment and see that
the Supreme Pontiff be as
sured of absolute freedom. . If
there ever -was an interna

nations It Is this very one. '
Xo moment could be more
opportune than the present for
understanding why this In the
case. The 230,000,000 of Cath

the recognised spiritual bead
are subjects of nil forms of
government, and no power
pleads for loyalty to lawfully
\ constituted government more
thjtn does the Papacyâ and for
the same reason no power
pleads more earnestly for
equal and exact Justice to all.
Will the governments of the
twentieth century rise to the
simple ' but overpowering
truth?

Expressions of Grief.
- Delegate Falconio repeatedly expressed
Jn conversation his deep i-ersonal regret
over the death of the Pope.
Bishop Rooker and Dr. Marchetti also
expressed profound sorrow. Bishop Rook
er gave out a statement In which he said:
The church boasts a long line of illustrious
Pontiffs. L*o XIII will ever stand in their
fcremost rank. His re'jjn has be*n a wonderful
one. He assumed the jxmtificate at a most
critical moment. He hands It to his successor
without a single loss and with great srafcri.
The Bishops of the Catholic church will

masses will be said In all Catholic
churches.
After the interment, prayers will be held
in the Catholic churches asking that di
vine guidance may attend the labors of
the consistory in their election of a suc

to Cardinal Rarnpolla:

God will raise up a man for us to" replace the
notable figure that has Just passed to his great
reward. Who he will be we have no means of
knowing. - Perhaps those living in daily con
tact with the Cardinals of Rome may be able
to make a forecast which? will prove more or
less reliable, but none can say who will suc

The selection of a successor la left to the
College 'of Cardinals, of which there are about
sixty living members. These will meet In con
clave, apart from all outside Influences and
after a season of fasting and prayer will ballot
for a new Pope. At the conclave * which se
lected Leo XIIII he was not considered a pos
sibility, but under divine guidance the College
of Cardinal* chose him for the high position
which he filled with such singular ability and
devotion. Â«
Naturally his successor will be an Italian,
although there Is no law In the church to com
pel this. There have been Popes of many na
tionalities, but of later times the tradition haa
been to select an' Italian for the position. As
American- citizens we look upon our Govern
ment as the best that has ever existed. Cath
olics of other - nationalities perhaps feel the
same way toward their governments. Conse
quently the selection of one of a nationality
not sanctioned by recent procedure might en

of the church.

no loss in the death of Leo XIII. no matter how

That we do not overshoot the mark In our
appraisement of the dead PontlS is evidenced
by. the universal voice of the world aa ex
pressed through the press and the voices of
statesmen and leaders In all the different walks
of life. All agree that Leo XIII will be one
of the Immortal figures of history and that
his influence as head of the Roman Catholic
church for the past twenty-five yean has left
a deeper Impress for the betterment of the
world at large than that of any single, maa
during the present era.
Even with this aid Leo XIII haa proved
himself a man second to none. Simple and
forcible in a kindly way. with a heart over
flowing with love for mankind and an abso
lute devotion to the church of which he twis
the head, it has been given to Leo XIII fa
accomplish more in the arena of universal pol
itics than any other man who has lived dur
ing the present age. Making for peace al
ways, he has drawn together more closely
than "ever before the nations of the world and
the Impress of his work will linger long after
the fame of warriors shall have been dimmed.
Bismarck welded together an empire by blood
and steel; Leo XIII sought to bind the world
with soft strands of love.
With all his kindness there was never a time
that Leo XIII when forced to an issue did not
take a determined stand, and once intrenched
In his position he was as immovable as Gibral
tar. Powers might batter at theTapal throne,
politician* protest and rulers rage, but the
Pope took no step backward. With an abiding
faith he waited and at his death he could look
back over hi* long reign with complacency, for
mest of his aims had been accomplished.
From me you can expect only an ex-parte
opinion. Personally I consider htm the great
est man of the nineteenth century, and I be
lieve my opinion will find an echo In the
hearts of the 250.000.000 Catholics who for the
past quarter of a century have acknowledged
his spiritual leadership.
An Archbishop's Tribute.
Coadjutor Archbishop Montgomery,
when asked to give his opinion 'as to what
place in history Pope Leo XIII would oc
cupy, raid:
A requiem high mass will be intoned at
St. Mary's Cathedral to-morrow morning
at 9 o'clock, at which all the clergy of the
parish will be present.
On the day of the funeral in Rome a
solemn mass of requiem will be intoned
in every church in the diocese where pos
sible, or at least a "missa cantata" will
be rendered.
The center of interest in San Francisco
on the day of the funeral will be at St.
Mary's Cathedral, where a solemn ponti
fical mass of requiem will be intoned and
a sermon delivered. Archbishop Rlordan
will celebrate the mass at the cathedral,
to which all the priests and members of
the Catholic church are invited. Thla
mass will begin at 10:3') on Wednesday
morning, and it is likely that there will
be a great gathering of clergy and laity,
rendering the occasion one of marked
solemnity and grandeur.
In a circular letter, addressed by Arch
bishop Riordan to the clergy of his dio
cese, .his Grace requests that during the
interregnum' the prayer found in the Mis
sal at the mass. "Pro eligedo Summo
Pontlflce," be said at all the mad<Â»s when
permitted by the rubrics.
Special prayers will also be offered for
the divine guidance of the Cardinals, who
will meet in conclave in Rome to elect
a Pontiff.
In every church in the diocese a rÂ»
quiem high mass will be Intoned this
morning at 9 o'clock.
The entrances and sanctuaries of all the
churches will be properly draped in
mourning and the emblems of grief will
be maintained until after the remains of
the late Pontiff are conveyed to the vault

Pope Leo XIII
His Selection
as Successor
to Pope Pius
ON December 10, 1S53, Pecci was
created Cardinal. On July 8. 1S77,
he succeeded Cardinal de Angells
as Camerlengo. or High Cham
berlain cf the Roman Church. In
this position he displayed the same
firmness and activity that had character
ized his lifelong connection with the
church. He promulgated some acts of
severity and insisted thr : persons under
the rule of the Vatican should hold them
selves amenable thereto. This severity
spread throughout the city of Rome ana
according to public opinion his probable
chances for the Pont'ilcate were material
ly diminished in con*tquence, but In real
ity 1t increased ths reputation of the
Camerlengo.
The career of Cardmai Pecci had been
watched with keen interest by Ratazzi,
who early formed an accurate estimate of
the man. In a letter to his wife he wrote-
"There is a man who has., in my opinion,
a great chance of succeeding to the Papacy
if Antonelli should die before the Pope,
and this is Cardinal Pecci, the Archbishop
of Perugia. And my opinion is that tbe
accession of Cardinal .Pccci to the Pontifi
cal throne would not produce much
change In the present btatus quo. Tills
Peed Is a man of undeniable merit, who
has often caused me much thought, and
much preoccupied my mind."
Ratazzi's expectations concerning Peed
were realized. AntonÂ»lli died, and Plu*
IX followed him * on February 7, 187?.
Pecci, in his capacity as Camerlengo,
acted as head of the church in temporal
matttrs, made the arrangements for the
obsequies of Pope Plus, received tho
Catholic embassadors and superintended
the preparations for the conclave. Sixty
two cardinals attended tbe conclave,
which was held February 18. 1S7S. The
Sacred College was divided into two par
ties. One called the "Zealots" was led by
Cardinal Billio, and the second, the "Moc
erates," by Cardinal Pecci.
Is Chosen Pope.
There were three ballotings, which,
on good authority, are said to have been
as follows:
First ballotâ Cardinal Pecci. 17 votes:
Cardinal BUHo, 6 votes; Cardinal dl Lucca.
5 votes: Cardinal Ferrierl. 4 votes. Cardi
nal Franchi. 4 votes. Cardinal Monaco de
la Valetta. 4 votes; the rest scattering. .
Second ballot â Cardinal Pecci, 35 votes.
No other Cardinal exceeded six votes.
Cardinal Martinelll rained two votes,
making three for this ballot
Third ballotâ Cardinal Peed, 44 voter.
The remaining votes were distributed as
follows: 11 were ci\'en to Cardinal
Franchi. 3 to Cardinal Mertel. 2 to Cardi
nal Siraeonl. 1 to Cardinal Bonaparte and
1 to Cardinal Ledokowekl.
At the end of this ballot Cardinals
Franchi and Billio rose and with their
adherents knelt before the Camerlengo.
Every one followed this example, and Car
dinal Pecci, having already received two
votes beyond the necessary majority, was
unanimously elected Pote.
The Monsignor who stepped up to him
and announced the result at the same
time offered his Holiness the customary
white silk skull cap, worn by the Supreme
Pontiff alone. Now, according to Imme
morial etiquette, the newly elected Pope
should have presented the messenger
with the red silk cap he had until then
worn, and so elevated the bearer of good
news to the dignity of Cardinal. Pecci,
however, merely accepted the new cap
and put the old one Into his own. pocket.
Then he was asked by what title he would
like to be proclaimed. "What saint's day
Is It?" he replied. "8t. Leo's." "Then
proclaim me as Leo XIII." . Â¦
Concerning His Modesty.
Cardinal de BonnechcEO used to tell this
story of the conclave: "Cardinal Peed,
who the previous evening had received
the largest number of votes, was, on that
Wednesday morning, pale and agitated.
He went to one of the members of the Sa
crc<I In whom he had every confi
dence, and said to him before the opening
of the ballot: 'I cannot restrain myself;
I feel the necessity of, speaking to 'the
Sacred College; I fear it may commit an
error. People have given me the repu
tation of a learned doctor; I am believed
to be a savant; I am not. I am supposed
to'have the qualities necessary to be a
Pope; I have not. That is what I wish to
say to the Cardinals.' - Fortunately, hlÂ»
The number of theological students In
Germany has diminished gradually from
42G7 in 1830 to 2149, or less than half, al
though the population has doubled since
1S30. The insufficiency In the number of
candidates for the ministry Is discussed
as a matter of exceeding gravity by Ger
man theologians.
Crowning the Pope.
At the end of the confession the 'first
cumstance formerly attending the
ceremonial in St. Peter's, only it
was not public, Inasmuch as the
Hmted space did not permit gen
eral admission, and for the same reason
no tickets were Issued. The Sala Ducale
was fitted up as a chapel, and the Pauline
Chapel was arranged for those prelimi
narv portions of the ceremonial formerly
performed In the Clementine and other
chapels of St: Peter's before the Pope
went up to tl.e high altar to be crowned.
The ceremony was attended by all the
Embassadors and Ministers accredited to
thÂ« Holy See. with their ladles and suites;
by all the Roman nobility counted among
the faithful, by the Duke and Duchess of
Parma and suite, who occupied the royal
tribune, and by the three or four hun
dred ladies and gentlemen, as many only
as filled all the tribunes without crowd
ing. At 9:30 o'clock his Holiness, attend
ed by the Pontifical Court, the College of
Cardinals and a large number of bishops
and other ecclesiastical dignitaries, en
tered the Sala Ducale, wearing a gold
miter. Having taken his seat on the
throne erected there, he received homage
from the cardinals, and. rising, pro
nounced the words "Sit nomen Domini
benedictum," giving the first benediction.
The preliminary ceremonies being com
pleted the procession formed and passed
out into the Sala Regia to the Pauline
Chapel, and thence again through the Sirla
Regia to the Slstlne. As the Pope and his
cortege came through the great door from
the Sala Ducale into the Sala Regia, they
formed a group far exceeding in magnifi

ever seen in St. Peter's ,in. past < times.

Magnificent
Ceremonial at
His Coronation
Leo brooked no advisers, and neither
asked nor expected 'any human aid. Ho
had a will of hla own and followed no
other. His own line ' f conduct was traced
long before .his accession. He had no
worldly policy; his reign was not of this
worla. his trust was not in princes; his
gendarmes and Swiss guards were only
an encumbrance and a vexation to him;
he had, faith in his priestly office â in his
ofltce as guardian of God's truth and her
ald of God's word. . He bade Christians
fight unbelief with Ms own weapons; he
taught them how to meet the sophisms of
man's sde'nce with the sounder argu
ments of God's knowledge; he would set
Aaron's red against the rod of the ma
gicians, and he pointed to Louvaln as the
mansion of truth against which the gates
of hell could not prevail. It was unarmed
faith, he thought, the reasoning, and not
the militant church, which ruies Belgium;
and If Belgium, why not one day France?
Why not eventually also -Italy? Spread
true light among the people; combat error
by dispelling Ignorance; win the masses
ever to the eternal, unchangeable truth;
base morality on heaven's law; bid God's
kingdom come; make God's will the peo
ple's will, and what king or parliament,
asked the Pcpe. could stand against It?
What array of civil authority or of mil
itary power could avail against the un
armed authority, the unassuming yet ir
resistible ascendancy of the church? Such
was Pope Leo's views of his mission ao
far as it can be made out from his pre
cedents as a Bishop and from his acts as
a Pontiff. 'â¢ , Â¦ .
Brooked No Advisers
Leo XIII lias worn the triple crown, and
that, excepting Prince Bismarck, no lay
man In Europe has shown such skill in
the moat' delicate diplomatic negotiations
as the late Pope. See all that he has
done. His successes in his negotiations
with the German Chancellor, and the re
markable foresight rhown in his dealings
with Spala and In putting the Holy See
into friendly relations with republican
France, showed his sktllfulness and rare
diplomatic sense. At, prince of peace he

interlocutor replied: 'As to your doctrine,
you have net to Judge of it, but us: as to
your qualities for the Papacy, God knows
them, but let him act.' He obeyed, and
soon, the number of votes given to him
having exceeded the two-thirds of the
total, he was named Pope."
The late Pope's first acts after his eleva
tion to the Papacy produced a favorable
Impression, because they denoted an en
lightened mind and a character at once
firm and moderate. He | found religious
matters- compromised and gravely trou
bled in various parts of the globe. He
was anxious to end the crisis. Thus, on
the very day of his election, in notifying
his advent to the throne to the Cabinets
of Russia, Germany, Switzerland and Bra
zil, he took the Initiative in favor of con
ciliation and formally expressed a desire
to smooth the difficulties which disturbed
the peace religious.
Toward the Italian Government the at
titude of Leo XIII was full of reserve and
dignity. He .was anxious to settle the
conflict concerning the taking possession
of their sees by theBlshops and the due
notification demanded by the Government.
Leo XIII prudently pointed out the urg
ent'necesslty of ending, this dispute.

a proud position In t l;e world, not only as
prince of the ; , church, but as prince of

Pontiff's Moderate Policy
The act of crowning the Pope was com
paratively simple. Cardinal Borromeo, as
sisting as deacon at mass, first pro
nounced over him a pmyer. The second
Cardinal Deacon then removed the miter
from his head, and the first placed the
tiara upon l(. Leo XIII then rose and,
wearing the tiara on his head, raised his
arms aloft and gave benediction. ' After
the benediction he left the throne for the
sedia gestatoria. and, carried, albft upon
It; still wearing the. tiara.. he blessed with
hi3 hand, waving it first to the one side
and then to the other, those kneeling
around sub he was borne to the' chapel.
Cardinal Deacon placed a gold miter on
the Pope's head, and he ascended the
throne, which .stood as of old on a dais at
the left side. The first Cardinal Bishop
then recited the customary three prayers
over him, after which he arose and. going
to the foot of the altar, knelt on the step,
while the first Cardinal Deacon removed
his tiara and the second Invested him
with a pontifical pallium. This done, the
Pape reascended the throne, when the
Sacred College a:id all the ecclesiastics
present went up to pay him homage, the
Cardinals kissing his foot and hl9 hand

the mass the Pope gave the benediction in
front of the altar and then returned to the
throne to receive the tiara.
From Bcnevento Peed was transferred
to the Important province of Perugia,
where he conducted himself with similar
boldness and Integrity. He was then nom
inated to be Apostolic Delegate at Spoleto,
but never entered on, that charge, for he
was dispatched to Brussels in 1S43 to act
Â¦s Nuncio to Belgium. At the same timo
he was created Archbishop of Damiata in
pertibus infidclium. Leopold II was much
pleased with Peed during the three years
he served at Nuncio, and 'when, from III
hezlth. Peed resigned from that office.
Leopold II gave him a letter to the Pope.
;n which he begged his Holiness xo create
Peed a Cardinal. Gregory XVI did not
immediately comply with this request, but
be gave Peed the bishopric of Perugia
and a promise made by letter of Lam
bnischlni. Secretary of State, to give him
a Cardinal's hat after a few years' time.
In 1S3S ne was sent to govern the Dcle
ratione (province) of Benevento. His se
lection for this Important position created
considerable surprise In the province in
consequence of the youth of the prelate.
He was not long there, however, before
the people were equally surprised at the
ability, energy and prudence displayed by
Pecci. and were brought to acknowledge
the wisdom of his appointment. He was
*-FpeclaIly successful In eradicating from
the^ -province the scourge of brigandage,
v.hich bad long been . terror to the popu
lace. The difficult experiment o_ ex:!n
cuishing this system of outlawry was In
creased by the fact that the cutlaws
rnade a rendezvous of the mountains sep
arating the Roman province of Benevento
from thÂ« NeopoIItan dominion, and In the
â¢jvent of pursuit cou.d caeily evaoo their
pursuers by simply crossing the border.
Cut notwithstanding this obstacle, Pecci,
\\y hi* aggressive policy, energy and per
nvcrancf, succeeded in thoroughly exter
minating them.
Carpineto. Gloachino Pecci's birthplace,
Is a Email town of some 4000 Inhabitants,
perched on a rocky eminence near Legnl
and Anagni. In Carpineto Is a palace
where the Pecci family have reigned for
generations and still possess an ample es
tate. When quite a child young Pecci
took kindly to his books, and under the
Jesuits he became one of the finest Latin
rcboJars of the age. He was early sent
to Rome for his studies, ajid he gained
youthful fame as a disputant for his de
trees In the Roman College and the Sapi
c-rza. He then entered the Academy of
Noble Ecclesiastics. His youth was a
eerles of academical triumphs, each of
which signalized the addition of a fresh
province of learning to his Intellectual
dominions. Classics were first mastered,
then mathematics, then physics and af
terward moral philosophy. In which he
pave instruction at the age of 19. Per
haps he might have remained a scholar
end nothing more, but In the third decade
of his life he fell under the influenceâ one
v-euld rather say rose to the Influence â
cf the famous Cardinal OdescalchI, a man
who In another age might have played
tht great part of Ignatius Loyola. Odes
calchI ft was who renounced the purple
to enter the Order of Jesus and who gave
innumerable other proofs of Christian hu
mility and oi devotion to his Master's
cause. Among the services which he
rendered to the Church of Rome not the
least was the conversion of Pecci, as one
tray call it in the true sense of the
word. He turned his mind to a serious,
though not to an austere, view of religion
and had the happiness of admitting him
to holy crdere. He was ordained priest
en December 23. ISC7, being already a lay
prelate In the bouschold of Gregory XVL
He was appointed one of the domestic
chaplains to Pope Gregory on March 16,

/;; the Days cf His Youth
Before obtaining the high honor of giv
ing a Pope to the church, the Peed fam
ily had already given It three prelates-
Giovanni, who became Bishop of Gros
setto la 1517; Paolo. Bishop of Malta in
1C9, and Giuseppe. Bishop of Grossetto Â«n
1710. Moreover, five members of the late
Pope's family belonged to the Sovereign
Order of St. John of Jerusalem.
Ludovlco Pecci, father of Leo XIII. was
a colonel in the French service, under Na
poleon I. He <li<=-d in 1S33. His wife, the
mother of the Pope, was of the Prosperl-
Buzi family of Cori. not far from Rome.
Â£he died in 1S21.
There were four children by this mar
riage, three sons and one daughter.

famous as the birthplace of four
Popesâ Innocent III. Gregory* I x -

Gloachino Pecci Â«.Leo XIII) was born.
March 2. 1S10. He was a member of
an old and Illustrious family of Siena. To
ward the middle of the thirteenth century
the Pecci family already wielded great
power In the country. They soon became
eo powerful that when Pope Martin V vis
ited Siena he was very comfortably quar
tered, together with all his court, in the
hcuse of the brothers Giovanni and Gla
ccrno Pecci, who further lent him the sum
cf 15,000 florins.
Pecci was made Bishop of Perugia In Jan
uary, 1S4C. and in a few months Gregory
XVI died. It has bcrn falsely said that
Gregory created Peect a Cardinal In petto
and that Pius IX delayed seven years be
fore he published that creation. But
every Cardinal created in petto takes pre
cedence from the date of his creation, not
from his publication, and Pius IX had no
power to Interpose delay In the publica
tion of a,ny Cardinal created in petto by
his predecessor, nor was Pius IX- bound
to fulfill the promise made by Gregory.
As Bishop of Perugia PeccI acquired a
great reputation for zeal, prudence and
activity, and his fame was constantly ex
tending to the Holy City. He labored to
promote the doctrines and the schools for
the clergy and people, not only in ec
clesiastical matters, but also in all
branches of knowledge.
A photograph of Cardinal Peed, taken
in 1S70. when be attended the Ecumenical
Council, gives one an admirable idea of
the personal presence of the Pope. With
it appear also the likenesses of all the
ether cardinals, .ancT.lt Is ho exaggera
tion to say that Pecd's head Is by far
the' most Impressive in this gallery. There
are sterner heads, heads more severely
intellectual, or austerely grand, or cast
perhaps in finer diplomatic mold; but for
supreme kindness and benevolence and a
certain beaming, gentle grace, no face
in the galaxy of cardinals can ap
proach it.
Like that of Pio Nonb, !t was a counte
nance that won at once and immediately
the way to the scrutinlzer's heart. At
the same time It was stronger in its In
tellectual quality than' was that of Pio
Nono, and it was particularly conspic
uous In the manifestation of sound sense
and clear Judgment.
The Pope was a member of the Confra
ternity of the Holy Blood of Bruges. The
relic in questionâ the blood of our Lord
is contained In a phial cf crystal and gold,
deposited in the chapel of that name In
the old Spanish-Flemish city. His Holi
ness was once asked whether be seriously
believed 'In the genuineness of the relic.
He frankly replied that he had not stu
died the question. "But," he added, "I
have In thl3 crucifix a relic asserted to be
j. portion of the true cross. What I do
know is that. accordlnsQto all laws of evi
dence, it can be traced back to the posses
sion of a Pope of the seventh century. "I
think, after proving this much, we may
fairly leave the burden of demonstrating
its unauthenticity to skeptics. The Popes
of the seventh century were shrewd
enough." '
Leo XIII was a tall man, rather spare
in build, but nevertheless of strong and
wiry physique. His presence was most
commanding. His head was very large
and thoroughly Italian. The forehead
was massive, high and rather straight
and was especially striking from Its great
width. Indicative of Intellectual strength.
The thin hair that streaked it was of sil
ver hue. The eyebrows were dark and
heavy and of perfect arch and the eyes
were singularly mild and soft and at the
same time penetrating and searching.
The large, well defined nose was charac
teristic of firmness and will power, decid
edly Roman in shape, but with wide nos
trils that were credited by physiogno
mists with bold leonine qualities.
In private life he was simple, affection
ate, lovable and witty. In the ceremonies
of the church, under the purple, he was
grave, austere and majestic. One â¢vould
pay that he was given to posing, but that
was not true. The pose with him was
natural; he did not seek It; it sought him.
It was the same with Pius IX. The pon
tificate creates a second nature.
ergy. Judgment, piety, virtues and
services are matters of record. He united
in' admirably proportioned degrees the
apostolic mildness with the administrative
rigor; he made himself at the same time
loved and feared. Personally he was a
man of stately bearing. His voice was
sonorous and. brilliant when he preached
and slightly nasal in familiar conversa
tion.
POPE LEO XIII entered his pon
tificate In the sixty-eighth year
of his age. a Â»ng-trled prelate,
whose strength of character, en-
"He recollects many of the people he
receives after intervals of as Ions: as stxty
years. Many years ago. when Lord
Palmerston was Premier, hla Holiness
visited England and was presented to tha
Queen and Prince Consort. Of that' visit
he still remembers the small details, and
only a short time ago he mentioned Sir
James Graham, who vas one of the Min
isters of the period, and spoke of the part
he took in a controversy respecting pests
and telegraphs." Again, when a Miss
O'Connell was presented to the Pope a
short time ago. Tils Holiness asked
whether she was a relative of the distin
guished parliamentarian of that name,
and on learning that she was his niece ha
said: ."I well recollect hearing your uncla
speak In the House of Commons."
His handwriting is peculiar enough to
excite Interest even If it were not that of
the Pope. It Is exceedingly small and of
very careful, laborious construction, as if
each of the Infinitesimal characters waj
formed with the most painstaking care.
In Its airy delicacy It resembles a lady's
hand, but the mosaic elaboration of every
stroke has something highly scholastic
about It. Under his diminutive signature
the Pope leaves half an inch of vacant
space and then completes it by flvo
dashes, growing successively smaller and
smaller.
Pope Leo XIILhad a marvelous mem
ory, which he retained up to the last.
Speaking of him In December, 1S36. Arch
bishop Stonor, who frequently attended on
him. said:
"It may be also partly for this reason
that it Is so difficultâ I had almost said
ini possibleâ to obtain an autograph of Leo
XIII, or even a simple signature.
"But let me also add that there is an
other reason for this. The Pope has a
real dread that his writing might be mada
to serve as a pretext for speculation
speculation In the sale of photographs
bearing his signatureâ as occurred in the.
days of Plus IX.
"Between 4 and 5 o'clock In the after
noon the Pope used to take his walk. At
this time no one unconnected with the
court was admitted to the gardens of the
Vatican. An eyewitness, however, who
had the good fortune to make friends
with the gardener. Salvatori. was placed
by him so as to be able to see the Pope
on one of his daily rambles. Leo XIII ad
vanced with long strides. h!s imposing fig

majestic Pontifical robes. The Pcpe pre

pointment of Salvatori, who had prepared
some rustic seats, the Pope did not profit

golden pheasants, at the fantailed pig

large part of the garden. 'His Holiness."
Sclvatori explained, 'takes a rapid walk

square, carefully graveled, were repro

Pent. Max..' the cypress, the star and tha
lilies of the Peccls being carefully out
lined. Leo XIII did not pay much atten
tion to the work of Salvatori, but ona
need not therefore conclude that his Holi
ness did not care for art. It was. he who
ordered all the tapestries which are in
the Vatican to be collected and placed in
chronological order and according to tha
schools to which they belong, a collection
which will be of exceptional importance,
and In many ways he showed his Inter
est In things not ecclesiastical but relat
ing to general culture."
" 'No one really knows anything about
It. We only see the light In the Pope's
room. The general opinion Is that he 13
praying or meditating. But one thing at
least is certain., he is not writing. He 13
very much averse to using the pen at all,
for his hand trembles.'
"When I asked a certain very well In
formed prelate as to how the Holy Father
occupied himself during: this lapsÂ© of
time, he replied:

the Roman- aristocracyâ of that portion
of It which has remained faithful to the
Holy See. be it well understood. About
10 p. m. the Pope retires to hla room,
where he remains shut up until half past
11 o'clock.

Peter of old, from his wife and 'receive

THE CALL'S Washington corre
epondent some time ago asked
Cardinal Gibbons, at Baltimore,
who was likely to succeed the
Pope In the event of the de
mise of Leo XIII. "Ah." said he. "out ,of
fifty-eight Cardinals who are eligible it
would be hard to say. But I think he will
certainly be an Italian, as they have near
ly a majority of all the Cardinals who will
be members of the Sacred College."
The correspondent had learned through
private letters from Rome, however, that
Pope Leo's successor will in all probabil
ity be one of the following, via.: Oreglla.

of the votes must be given by ballot to
validly elect. When the Cardinals cannot
agree-they can- select- two Cardinals and
leave the election of the Pope to them.
This is. called, an, election by compromise,
and when all without delay proclaim a
certain one for. Pope, as If by inspiration,
this is called an election by quasl-Inspira

His | electjon was due to Cardinal An

seeing that Cardinal PecchI was gaining
in favor at' each ballot, went over to him,
knell down and kissed his hand and
saluted him as the holy father. The
other Cardinals took In the situation and
with one. acclaim proclaimed him Pope.
Thus Leo XIII owes his election to quasl

and no one has received a two-thirds vote

and burned. ;. The smoke ascending
through a certain chimney is a sign to an

As Pope Leo has remained at the Vatican
as a prisoner ajnee his election the Vati

the next election. Again, the Vatican con
tains 1100 rooms, and there is a Very spa
cious hall in the Vatican set apart and
fitted up for this special purpose for the
election of the Pope. Each Cardinal Is
allowed two rooms, called cells, one for
himself and one for his secretary. During
these days, and up to this time, the usual
everyday official business of the Car
dinals' lives goes on. Ministers and Em
bassadors come to transact business with
the various Cardinals. They stand before
them with uncovered heads and in the
same manner as before the Pope himself,
since the Cardinals have now assumed
supreme power In the chorch. Only one
Cardinal responds to the questions asked
by the representatives" of the various
Governments, namely, the Dean of the
Sacred College. Finally a sermon Is de
livered in Latin on the solemn duties of
the conclave, and they go in procession to
the place where the conclave is to meet.
The papal choir, consisting of the best
male voices In Rome, is in attendance,
and they sing the "Venl Creator." Whea
the Cardinals assemble in the chapel 'the
bulls are once again read, and again they
take the oath to conscientiously observe

address is delivered by the Cardinal dean

Election in the Vatican.
rHE dean of the Sacred College at
the Pope's death summons every
Cardinal in Rome and throughout
the whole world to take part in
the election. There is no exception to
this rule, if any Cardinal were
prevented from casting his vote it
would Invalidate the election. In {he
primitive ages of the church even the
laity had a voice In the selection of tho
Sovereign Pontiff, but in these days the
election Is entirely In the hands of Car
dinals and their vote it is that decides"
who it is that is to be the legitimate
Pope.
The elections begin at least ten days
after the Pontiffs death. If the foreign
Cardinals cannot arrive In Rome, either
through sickness or old age or other In
disposition, the election proceeds, and the
College of Cardinals cannot wait any
longer. Should any Cardinal arrive after
the ten days have elapsed he has a right
to enter the conclave then in session. In
the first session of the conclave each of
the Cardinals takes a solemn oath on the
Gospels to observe the canons that refer
to the election in the conclave. The
bulls of the nine Popes who legislated on,
the mode of procedure In the election of
the Pope by ballot In the conclave are
read aloud to them. The Fisherman's
Ring, being part of the insignia of the
Holy Father, is now unsealed by the mas
ter of the ceremonies, and the first session
of the conclave comes to a close. On the
second day the various officers of the
pontifical states come to pay their re
spects to the Cardinals, and receive con
firmation in their various offices, and the
next three days are spent in elections' to
the' different offices that are to be filled
In the conclave. On the sixth day the
cells that each Cardinal Is to occupy are
allotted to him, where both the Cardinal
and his secretary are to dwell during the
whole time of the conclave. â¢
When the election takes place in Rome
it takes place either at .the Qulrinal or at
tne Vatican palace. The fact that the
Quirinal is now in the hands of the Gov
ernment and the residence of the present
King will preclude the next election being
held at the Qulrinal. Pope Pius IX was
elected at the Quirinal, while Pope Leo
XIII was elected at the Vatican. Should
the Pope die In any other city than Rome
the election can take place in that city.
Â«Â¦Â» w Â«j(IÂ£X the Pope dies the Camer-
M M ylengo gently strikes the head
f#/of the dead Pontiff with a
wooden mallet, calling him by
name to verify his death. It Is
mere ceremony, coming from the old Idea
of verifying the death of the Pope, and has
its origin In the fact that many people
were buried alive, and so to be absolutely
cure of the death of the Holy Father this
simple ceremony takes place.' He Is pro
nounced dead and the offices of the church
are celebrated with an unusual splendor
for the repose of his soul. The Basilica
cf Bt. John's Is draped in black velvet
asd gold bullion. The obsequies takÂ«
place In the grand Basilica, of St. Peter's,
â¢nd all Rome turns out in deep mourning
for the father of all Christendom.
The holy sacrifice of the mass Is cele
brated with the greatest ceremony, the
efficiatlng clergyman being the Bishop of
Ostla. The sound of the sixty silver
trumpets that are wont to play Vivlani's
Erand march 500 feet up in the great dome
et the solemn entrace of the Pontiff Into
6t. Peter's gives place to the solemn dirge
of the requiem by the papal choir, and
the Pope's remains are afterward depos
ited in a sarcophagus specially prepared
for their reception over the door of the
great earrlsty of the papal court, where
they remain till a mausoleum is built
either in the church or In the cemetery
designated by the Sovereign Pontiff while
he Is still in the \igor of manhood. When
his sepulcher is ready a day Is fixed and
the remains of the Pope are translated to
their last resting- place.
Days of Persecution.
During the first centuries of the exist
ence of the Catholic church persecution
drove the faithful into the very bowels of
the earth, where they constructed large
caves cut out of soft rock called tufa
granularia that underlies the city of
Rome. Down in these caverns the suc
cessors of St. Peter were elected to the
highest throne on earthâ the throne of the
Galilean fisherman that has withstood
the storms of nineteen centuries and baJe
defiance to the Intrigues of nations and
of people that the church might fulfill her
mission on earth and bear out Christ'*
prophetic words that "tHe gates of hell
should not prevail against her," and that
"Christ is to be with her even to the con
summation of the world." Down in these
catacombs It was. that the first pontiffs
were elected for over S00 years.
The royal houses of the world are only
of yesterday compared with the endur
ing line of the Papacy. Our own United
States goes back but one hundred years.
The Bourbons of France and the Haps
burgs of Austria boast of but a few hun
dred years' reign. England changes from
day to day and becomes more and mor6
republican. The German enipire only
dates from 170L The house of Napoleon
collapsed after the Franco-Prussian war.
The Czar of Russia's history is very short
end is written In pages of human blood.
Italy is but a child compared with the
Papacy. The Papacy r&es back 1900 -rears
to the dawn of civilization and is the
link between the new world and the old.
It brings us back to when the world was
jiagan and the smoke of the .sacrifice
ascended from the pagan altars of Greece
and Rome. In the reign of Fope St. Syl
vester the Empress Helena, mother, of
Constantlne. placed .it the Pope;s dis
posal the beautiful palace of the Lateran.
in which she built a chapel for the Sov
ereign Pontiff, which was afterward
called St. Jchn Lateran. It exists to
the present day and (s called the mother
cf all churches. The inscription over the
present edifice built on that very spot is
"Mater Omnium Ecclcsiai-um" (the moth
er of all churches). The first fifty-six
Popes were canonized saints and the first
twenty-nine Popes gave up their lives In
testimony of the faith and were bonord on
the altars as martyrs.
Pope Is Elected for Life.
The Pope is elected for llfe-roncea PopÂ«
a Pope till deathâ and even when dead tha
Cardinals do not wield hi* power. The
Cardinals are to the church what the
Senate of old Rome was to the peoplo
and what the Senate of this country Is to
the United States. The administration of
the church during the Interregnum be
longs to the Cardinals. The dean of the
Sacred College is their president. They
can undertake no important change in
the affairs of the church. The duty that
devolves upon them then is to elect the
next successor to St. Peter. Pope Greg
ory X so legislated In the year 1T73. They
cannot create new Cardinals nor new
Bishops. Sixtus V gave the Roman con
gregations ordinary jurisdlct.cn during
the vacancy of the Holy See on account
of urgent cases that come UP every day
and cannot be postponed lest detriment
would accrue to souls by business being
left unsettled. Hence the Cardinals have
universal Jurisdiction over the whole
church during a vacancy and they can,
where danger to the church or matters of
great importance turn up, administer and
pass Judgment in such urgent cases.
Should a dispute or doubt arise about the
\-alidity or legality of the Pope's election
a council of the whole church Is in order
and If this becomes impossible the Col-
side of the paper, folds it, seals it
with his own seal, made for him and
supplied "â¢for- - the --occasion.--- An t altar
is erected at the end of' the
chapel 'and a large gold chalice and paten
are placed thereon. The inspectors of
election take their place at the altar. - The
Cardinal Bishop of Ostla Â«is the first to
rise." He writes his name on his ballot in
public at the center of the table, and ap
proaching the altar kneels, prays and ris
ing says: "I take Christ our.Lord to wit
ness I vote for the one whom In the
sight of God I deem worthy, and I will do
the same in case the accesus is used." He
then places the sealed ballot oh" the paten
and allows it to fall into. the chalice. The
Cardinals, now approach in border of rank
and .vote after -the same manner. ' The
sick Cardinals send their votes 'through
the committee appohited. The first Cardi
nal Inspector covers the chalice .with the
paten and t shakes It. The third Cardinal
inspector counts the ballots and sees that
they agree with, the number of Cardinals
present. If there Is any discrepancy the
ballots are burned and they > begin the
election anew. Three Inspectors then read
the names of each candidate r aloud, so
that each name be heard by, all. Each
Cardinal writes the name f so read at his
own desk and keeps; an account of the
votes cast for each candidate. The bal
lots are then returned once again to the
chalice. Â¦ K| two-thirds of the \ vote are

Cardinals to vote for him who seems, best

this search takes place twice every day.
Even the food is searched for secret docu
ments to see thatit' contains no'letters or
advices or matters 'prejudicial to the con
scientious and Just election of the Pontiff.
How Balloting
for Holy Office
Is Conducted
lege of Cardinals can proclaim who Is the
legitimate Pope, Impeach the usurper and
depose him. By an old tradition the Bish
op of Ostla Is dean of the Sacred Colleg6
of Cardinals. It belongs to him as the
Bishop of Ostla and he, as president of
that august body, carries on the business
of the church during the interregnum.
The most extraordinary precautions are
taken to shut out intrigues and political
influence. Each of the European nations
naturally takes an Interest in the election
and zealously- tries to have the election
turn out to Its own Interest.: 'All these
The word "conclave" comes from ' the
fact of closing -the door with a ' key.
"Clavis" in Latin means a key. The word
conclave refers to. the inclosure as well as
to the body of Cardinals lw session. All
secular influence ceases for good, so as to
leave the Cardinals untrammeled in their
selection of a successor to St. Peter. This
assembly of Cardinals is the most august
assembly in the world, is the only as
sembly that is known by the word con
clave. In the veins of these Cardinals
flows the purest and richest and noblest
blood on earth. They are the sons of the
old Romans', descended from the conquer
ors of the world, heirs of the Senators of
old Rome who made and unmade nations.
The cells in which the Cardinals are : to
dwell during elections are , twenty feet,
square and twenty feet high. The cells of
the Cardinals who have been elected to
office by the late Pope are decorated with
violet tapestry, while the cells of the older
Cardinals are covered with green or red.
The cell " is "divided" into ' two" compart
ments, one for the Cardinal and the other
for his secretary. A Cardinal of princely
rank may have three cells and two sec
retaries for personal attendants. When all
are assembled within, the windows and all'
entrances to the ' conclave are closed.
There is only one door to the conclave,
and thl3 Is locked with a double key, one
on the outside and one on the inside.' The
governor, who is a cardinal appointed by
the Sacred College, holds one key on the
inside, and the marshal, who Is a lay of
ficial,,on the outside, is the custodian of
the other key. There are four apertures
in the walls, called gates, through which
all their meals are passed' and anything
else that is absolutely required. All this
is to avoid any communication with the
.outer world and to prevent fraud or polit
ical influence being used on the Cardinals
In the casting of their votes. The outside
halls' are also locked and the Â¦ Cardinal
Camerlengo keeps these keys. Papal
troops are drawn up in attendance- and
are in charge of one of the Princes of the
house of Chlgl, who also takes charge of
some of the outer keys and guards the
conclave from violence, = ' Â¦ â¢

that before the end of his pon

about a bette* understanding between
capitalists and workingmen, or, rather,
between the so-called masses and classes,
and in .this encyclical he pointed out
those steps which. In his opinion, might
veil be taken with the object of attain

things he said:

document His Holiness also expressed
disapproval o'f labor riots, and further
discussed the relations ot Catholics to

bishops. On 'these points he says:
"The Roman Pontiff, since he cannot

ati the Vatican and its . surroundings a
large number of personages who tremble
with fear. at. the Idea of Rampolla becom

For ten years past he haa "'een like, a

Cardinal Mariano Rampolla del Tlndara
is one of the most curious figures In tha
Pleiades of "Papabile." Tha nobility of
his character renders him disdainful of
the little tricks by which some of his
rivals flatter themselves that they dis
simulate their ambition. He avows it with
the frankness of a "grand seigneur" who
is of opinion that It is not a position be
yond his merits. He would add. without
false modesty, the device of Fouquet to
that of his family. Thus everybody
knows that he is working with assidutt?

Cardinal Svampa Is also credited with
leanings In the direction of a reconcilia
tion with the Quirinal. a fact which ex
plains the zeal with which. a number of
Italian journals try ro force his candi
dacy to the front. They quote wordj
which he is said to have addressed to
those who make aMuÂ«!on to the possi
bility of his election: -I feel that I should
be unworthy of it; but If Ood should im
pose this burden on me a great many
changes will be seen." This, it will be no
ticed. Is a Delphic utterance, which aoe*
not in. any way tie bis hands, but which
has sufficed for Cardinal Svampa to ba
regarded as a "Pope of conciliation."
If the annals of the Vatican are con
sulted from the time of St. Feter to the
present day It will be seen that the relgna
of Plus IX and Leo XIII have been very
long in comparison with these of thÂ«
greater number of their colleagues. If
Cardinal Svampa should be elected at the
next conclave and If he should live as long
as Leo XIII his. pontificate would last
thirty-eight years. This T7ould mean that
no Cardinal now living could ever aspire
to the purple. This 13 askinw too much
from human nature.
Moreover. Cardinal Svampa might be In
dicated twice over in the prophecies of
Malachy, because his camÂ« in Italian is
almost aynonymau3~-wltb flame.

sacred fire; Cardinal Gottl. whose arms
bear a torch, and Cardinal Svampa, whosa

Why should Cardinal Svampa. Arch
blshcp of Bologna, figure In the list of
'"Papabile" in preference to so many other
members of the Sacred College whose
merits are equal and even superior to his?
No one can say. unless this favor is dus

whose arms correspond to the prophecy
of Malachy. You are aware that the Abb*
Malachy, who died In the odor of sanctity,
left a series of prophecies relating to the
different Popes who might be elected after
his death. Chance has so willed it that
hitherto his predictions have been Justi
fied by events. . It is true that they were
couched in mottoes the terms of which
were sufficiently vague, and that a variety
of Interpretations could be placed on
them. The motto of the PopÂ« who was to
succeed Pius IX was "lumen de coelo."
It happened that Leo XIII had in his es
cutcheon, beside a cypress, a star on a
field azure. According to the prophet

It is hard to. tell how the candidature
of Cardinal Gottl sprang Into existence.
He is a monk of the barefooted Carmelite
order, and Is as Llgurian as Pope Julius
II. But he knows how to put on a humble
attitude, holding himself apart from the
miseries of this world like Sextus V. Be
fore he threw away his crutches. He dis
played diplomatic qualities of the highest
order In the mission to Brazil confided to
him. by Leo XIII.
In that country, in addition to the con
flict going on between the civil and relig
ious'authorities, the church was in con
siderable danger on account of the lack of
discipline and of the dissolute morals
which prevailed among the clergy and the
episcopate. To the great* astonishment of

rHE late Pope made his will
about six years ago. This will
Is not only a personal, but also'
a political testament, the execu
tors named being Cardinals
Oreglia. Rampolla and Mocaslni. In it
he bequeathed property to his three
nephews ' and two nieces, but it
Is believed that in order to avoid
the charge of nepotism he arranged
In another * way that they should
receive larger sums than, those mentioned
in the will. This document also contains
directions for his funeral and tomb, and
points out which of the jubilee presents
received by him shall remain the property
of the See of Romo and which are to be
otherwise distributed as part of his pri
vate property.
His Holiness revised his will later, ow

his entourage, principally those of Car

ta. The Pope enjoyed a yearly Income of
about 7,500.000 'Ire. of which he kept for
his own expenses only 1.000.000. Of the bal
ance, 700,000 lire was at the disposal of
the Cardinals, being given to thoÂ«e who
live in Rome, each Cardinal drawing a
yearly Income at 23,000 lire; 4o0,000 lire was
distributed among the poor dioceses;
l.SOO.000 lire went to the prefecture of the
apostolic palace; 1,000,000 lire wen* to the
offlce of the secretary of state, for foreign
business; 1,500,000 lire was spent on sala
ries to the Vatican personnel, and 1,040.000
lire went to schools and charity. The mil
lion which the Fope reserved for himself
was used not only for his personal ex
penses, but also for his private charities
and for purchasing art treasures and the
presents "that he made to sovereigns and
other rulers.
In September, 1896, It was mooted that a
scheme was in the air for all the Roman
Catholics of the world to combine and
raise Â£300,000.000 to be placed in the hands
cf the Pope.. "With this It was proposed to
purchase the city of" Home* and a slrlp of
land leading to the seaport from the Ital
ian Government, so as to secure the Inde
pendence of the pontiffs. The scheme
seemed *.o many utterly quixotic, yet
there seems every reason to believe that
those who proposed It were earnest and
would gladly have seen it carried out.

in the effort to. save the. life of his wife.
Sherman D. Gregg, the other victim, oc
cupied a room farther back on the same
floor. When a friend called to ' him he
answered, "All right, I will be with you
in a minute." That was the last heard
of him. To those on the ground it seemed
a long time before the department water
was turned on. Three streams were used
to check the flre. The wind swept across
the street, setting flre to "The Cottage"
and the warehouse in the rear of the old
A. E. Company building. The cabins on
Second street and Hogan's alley were
burned. It took hard work to save the
PostofSce and the United States Commis

of the Commissioner's office was burned.

SEATTLE, July 20.â The most destruc
tive flre in the history of Nome "burned
the Golden Gate Hotel, the Cottage, the
old A. E\* warehouse and a dozen cottages
and cabins early on the morning of July
6. Nearly 200 people were driven from
their beds by the flames, many of them
barely* escaping in their night clothes, and
three persons were roasted to death. They
were R. M. Hayes, a millionaire of Pitta
burg, and his wife, and Sherman D. Gregg
of- Pittsburgh The hotel property loss ex
ceeded J110.000. .
The greatest damage done was the de
struction of the Golden Gate Hotel, a
three-story structure. Fred C. Edglnton
stepped from "the roof of the burning
building to the ground and broke hlB leg.
The fire started through the carelessness
of the hotel cook, T. R. Barr, in attempt
ing to start^a" fire in a range with kero
1 sene. There^was an.- explosion, and in an
I instant the kitchen was in flames. The
kitchen was in the northern end of the
building, and as a strong northeasterly
wind was blowing the smoke, quickly fol
lowed by the flames, swept through the
hotel before the guests could be aroused.
Night Clerk H. C. Edginton lost no time
in turning In an alarm and notifying the
sleeping guests of their peril, but the
flames spread with such rapidity, that be
fore the fire department had reached the
scene the building was doomed.' The
guests when awakened were blinded and
choked with smoke and most of them fled
in their night clothes.- When a window
pn the west side of the building'' was
opened a great column of black smoke
poured out of it. Before all the Inmates
of the hotel had escaped the flre had cut
off egress by means of the stairway, and
a number of people escap'ed through the
windows by the aid of ladder?.

SANTA CRUZ, July 20.â Maria de Los
Angeles Majors, one of the last of the old
time mission Mexicans, died yesterday
and In her death a remarkable woman
was taken away. One who for many
years had been among the heaviest tax
payers of the, county lived to see her
vast possessions of land and stock disap
pear. During the last years of her Ufa
she found It necessary to accept support
from the county.
She came from the Castro family, her
father being one of the Spanish dons.
Jnaquln Castro, her father, came to San
ta Cruz in 1790 with the Franciscan fath
ers from Mexico. They established the
Mission Santa Cruz. Maria de Los An
geles Castro, his daughter, was born In
1818, being 85 years of age at the time of
her death. She was born in one of the
adobe homes of the village of Branci
forte in what is now -known as East San
ta Cruz. She was baptized by the early
missionaries in the old mission church
and given the name of Maria de Los An
geles. With her two sisters she waa
given by the Government of Spain by the
Refuglo grant three leagues of land ex
tending from Moorea Gulch up the coast
to Laguna Creek. In 1833 she married
Joseph L. Majors, an Englishman, who
arrived in Santa Cruz In 1S34 from Ten
nessee. SSKsS

Reyps and sont telegrams Tor assistance.! have
i-ot the slirhtest Idea what caused the wreck,
but am certain it was not the excessive speed
of the train. -
Ernest Duden testified as follows
I live at 1330 California street. San Fran
c:*co.J I was a passenger on thÂ«* train. On
the trip up we stopped two or three times for
repairs. We arrived at Tomales about 1:30.
We were informed we must leave at 2:30 or
wait until much later. My wife and I ar
rived at the depot before that time. At 2:30
people were still coming and the conductor
held the train. We left there, according to my
watch, at 2:.U. When we arrive J at Point
Ke>es we remained there about S minutes. My
wife and I were sitting together. The first I
knew of the accident the car cave a lurch,
swayed to the right and then to the left. There
was a crash and I came in contact with some
debris and loÂ«t ccnsclousneas. When I came
to I found I was the only one not pinned down.
1 did not flnd my wife until people came and
cut In the front end of the car. The railroad
company did all they could to make us all
comfortable.
The train was running fully thlrty-flve miles
an hour when the accident occurred. What
attracted my attention to the speed was that
the water dashed out of the tender when the
engine lurched around the curves. I remarked
at that time we were running too fast.
James Tunstead of San Anselmo, ex-
Sheriff of Marin County, who was one of
the most seriously injured passengers,
was seen In San Rafael Immediately af
ter the investigation to-day. He said:
I dl>l not know It was to come off this morn
ing. I did not care, anyway. I will talk
when the proper time comes. One vital mis
take the company made was to notify Mr.
Shoemaker In Tomalen that the train must
leave there at 2:30 and be In Sausallto by 4
o'clock. That space of time In Itself did not
give the engineer time to make the run In -any
iSVmlle per hour speed. I saw we were golntc
too fast and I remarked about It. It la easy
enough to tell how fast by looking at the tele
graph poles or fence posts. I also observed
that there was no bellcord attached to the
engine. To be positive. I put on my glassen
and saw that thÂ»re was none In the eyelet. I

WHEN the beneficial acts of this adjninistra
tion are summed up for the submission of
the record to the American people, ample
note should be given to what is being done for the
protection of food and drink from adulteration and
from counterfeiting. Attention has been frequently
directed to the action of the Government in enforc
ing the law forbidding the importation of adulterated
or misbranded articles, of food, medicine or drink
from foreign countries; and it now appears that a
similar vigilance is to be exercised over interstate
commerce, as far as the law permits, for the purpose
of preventing adulterations and misbranding in the
A report from* Washington says the only offense
of the kind recognized by the Sherman law is that of
shipping misbranded merchandise, but that is pun
ishable by a fine of from $500 to $1000. It is believed
by the officials that while the law is not sufficiently
comprehensive to cover all the wrongs perpetrate'd in
the way of placing fraudulent foods and medicines on
the market, yet enough can be done under the act,
when taken in connection with that of last winter, to
greatly mitigate the evil..
The steps taken by the Government will furnish
object lessons for the education of Congress. There
is, of course, a powerful lobby to oppose any effort
at suppressing the pernicious trade, but when Con
gressmen perceive the degree of favor shown by the
people to the laws now in operation, they will be
likely to complete the needed legislation on the sub
ject and furnish the administration with authority
to put a stop altogether to one of the most far-reach
ing evils of modern trade.
The manufacturers and sellers of adulterated or
misbranded goods of this kind injure consumers and
subject the producers of honest goods to unfair com
petition. It is therefore in the interest not only of
public health and of honesty, but of legitimate indus
try, to put a stop to the practice. The administration
has already accomplished much in that direction, and
the work merits the recognition, the approval and the
support of the people.

NEW TORK, JuJy Â».â The following
Callfornlans have arrived at the New
York hotels:
' number of Democratic papers have be
pun advertising for candidates. The Philadelphia
Reccrd puts forward this bid: "If the right man will
make a speech or write a letter reaffirming in clear
and ringing terms, and without circumlocution and
evasion, the historic doctrines of the party, the doc
trines under which it has won victories, the Demo
cratic rank and file will recognize him at once as their
-leader; he will be virtually nominated before the
convention, and he will be a platform himself."
There is the chance of a lifetime. The right man
will please get to work at once on the preparation of
the letter or speech. The question should be set
tled before the silly season is over, for when business
is resumed in the fall the people will have no time
nor inclination to give attention to a dispute as to
who is to be the Democratic Panjandrum next year.
Some of the New York watchers on the signal
lower assert that Parker is the man who will play the
pelt of Moses, for everything is coming his way. On
ihc other hand a New York correspondent of the Bos
ton Transcript writes that the talk of Parker is in
tended merely to cover an intrigue for Hill and that
the New York politicians have no illusions on the
subject. A Washington corrrespondent of the Phila
delphia Ledger says a Western Congressman, who
has been making a tour of New England, reports that
the Ea=t is about solid for Olney and that it is under
stood he will receive the support of Cleveland.
The Baltimore American learns that there is a strong
movement going on toward Judge George Gray of
Delaware; while the Washington corrrespondent of
the Atlanta Constitution avers that all signs around
the capital point to the nomination of Gorman.
As one of those authorities is about as good as an
cther, the friends of the various candidates named
may take choice as to which they will believe. It is
but fair to the Constitution man to say that he re
views the whole field before declaring that Gorman is
the probable winner. He puts down the list of can
didates in this way: "Of the men placed in the list of
possibilities, the most prominent besides the Mary
land Senator are Mr. Olney of Massachusetts, Mr.
Hill and Judge Parker of New York; Judge George
Gray, now on the United States bench and formerly
Senator from Delaware; Mayor "Tom" Johnson of
Cleveland, former Governor Francis of Missouri and
Mayor Carter Harrison of Chicago. Occasionally
one hears of W. R. Hearst of New York, but nobody
takes the Hearst talk at all seriously."
The candidates who are not taken seriously may as
well be dismissed from further consideration, for
Democracy is going to be very serious for the next
twelve months. Of the serious candidates it is to be
noted that several are already being subjected to the
puncturing process. It is asserted that Parker is by
nature so cold that when he went to Georgia to at
tend the meeting of the State Bar Association he pro
duced such a frost that it came very near killing the
watermelons. The Springfield Republican dismisses
Judge Gray by declaring that he accepted a seat on
the Supreme bench as a reward for voting for the
annexation of the Philippines while in the Senate.
Hill of New York will doubtless be counted out by
Tammany on the quiet, and the ruction in Missouri
will sidetrack Francis of that State. There will be
left then just Olney, Gorman and Tom Johnson.
â¢ Under such conditions it is not surprising that a
AX uld story tells of a man who was so cross
eyed that he looked two ways for Sunday.
Reasoning; from that precedent, the Demo
ir.au: party must be a cross-eyed Argus, for it is
looking about two hundred ways for a candidate for
the Presidency. Representatives of various factions
arc quite sure they see the coming man, but they do
not agree as to the individual. There are representa
tives of other factions who declare no man is coming,
but they swear they see a winning candidate sitting in
the shade of the woods and taking it easy, waiting for
ihc party to come up and hand him the nomination
c:i a silver salver.

S'AN RAFAEL., July 20.â The Cor-
I oner's Investigation into the cause
of the wreck of the funeral train
on the North Shore Railroad, near
Point Reyes, Sunday, June 21, in
which Anton Roman and Michael Kirk
lost their lives and twenty-four out of
the thirty passengers* sustained, injuries,
was ended to-day. The Coroner's Jury
THE forests of the United- States are making
their last stand on this coast. Already, not only
destructive lumbering but niore destructive fires
are wiping them out. Perhaps we are too far away
from the locality of the Eastern. forest* to be admon
ished, by their fate, but it may be interesting to the
few who seem to know the relations of forests to fer
tility to know the facts. â¢ '
In an address to the Society of American Foresters
in March last, President Roosevelt said: "The object
of forestry is not to preserve the forests because they
are beautiful, though that is good in itself, nor be
cause they are refuges for the wild creatures of the
wilderness, though that, too, is good in itself; but
the. primary object of our forest policy, as of the
land policy of the United States, is the -making of
prosperous homes. It is a part of the traditional
policy of home-making of our country. The- whole
effort of the Government in dealing with the' forests
must be directed to this end, 'keeping in view the fact
that it is not only necessary to start the homes as
prosperous, but to keep them so. That is why the
forests are to be kept. -You can start a prosperous
home by destroying the forests, but you cannot keep
it prosperous that way." . \ '/".'Â¦ Â¦<Â¦Â¦ â¢
Those words are df deep import to California. ' The
preservation of the forests here is the preservation of
the fertility of the valley lands, and therefore the
preservation of the prosperity of the homes located
thereon. If our forests are given over to saw and
fire as were those of the East, their end will come
sooner because of the aridity of our climate.
The figures on the Eastern forests stagger the imagi
nation. The forest area' of Michigan, Wisconsin and
Minnesota, principally white pine,, contained-origin
ally a stand of three hundred and fifty billion feet.
Lumbering that region began in 1836, but was not of
much consequence until the early seventies, when in
creased population made the demand. In 1873 the cut
was four billion feet, and it reached the maximum in
1892, when it was over eight billion five hundred mil
lion feet. Then it declined, and last year barely
reached five billion feet. In the last thirty years the
lumber cut aggregated one hundred and eighty-eight
billion feet, lath and shingles twenty-eight billion feet.
With the fifty billion feet cut before 1873, the total is
two hundred and sixty-six billion feet. It is esti
mated that of the remainder of eighty-four billion feet,
sixty billion was destroyed , by fire, leaving the
wretched remnant of twenty-four billion out of that
vast forest. ,
y The yellow pine is in the Southern States. Lum
bering in it began later than in the white pine of the
North. Of it one hundred and sixty-three billion feet
have been already lumbered, and there is left'a hun
dred and thirty-seven billion feet, which is being
vigorously attacked and will soon disappear. No sec
ond growth of white pine is coming on, the forest
fires having made that impossible, and the same fate
may be expected in the case of the yellow pine, and
the two long-leaved members of the family may be
regarded as ended in that part of the continent.
When the forests of this coast are destroyed to the
same extent. as those in the East, the effect on our
climate will be seriously felt, and as a place for homes
we will be worse off that any other part of the
country.
CORONER'S JURY PLACES
NO BLAME ON COMPANY
THE death of Pope Leo XIII will excite the
sympathy of the civilized world, without distinc
tion of race or creed. Born March 2, 1810, his
name was Vinceneo Giacchino Pecci. On his
mother's side he was a descendant of Cola di Rienzi,
the last of the Roman tribunes. He achieved the
highest honors in scholarship, and was not only a re
markable linguist, but deeply versed in modern
science. He was made a priest on December 23, 1837,
and within a few years became the Apostolic Dele
gate at Bcncvento, where, at an early age, he dis
played his unconquerable firmness and his executive
power by the suppression of brigandage. He was
afterward qualified to become the Nuncio to Brus
sels, where his service was principally diplomatic and
where he deeply 'studied those? political and social
problems to which, after his elevation to the Papacy,
he attracted such widespread attention. Then he was
Bishop of Perugia for thirty-two years, when he was
made a Cardinal, and in 1877, as Cardinal Camer
lingo, he performed the solemn ceremony of lightly
tapping the forehead of his predecessor, Pius IX, with
a silver hammer and officially announcing his death,
and shortly afterward was elected his successor.
This bald outline, filled up in the columns of The
Call, brings before our readers one of the most fruit
ful-lives of the century, prolonged not only in years
but in vigor, in influence and in impressiveness, and
which was greatest at its close. It is not our
province to discuss Leo XIII in his capacity of Su
preme Pontiff or spiritual head of a great church
that numbers among its children more than two hun
dred millions of human beings, of every race and
living under every form of government. Nor is it
within our purpose to dwell upon his scholarship,
which was deep, broad and thorough, and ranked
him among scientists, philosophers and poets. The
central point of secular interest in his wonderful
career is his statesmanship, which alone would have
placed him almost, if not quite, at the head of the
illustrious men of the nineteenth century. His grasp
of the burning questions of tl\e day and the luminous
intelligence with which he treated them were enough
to immortalize his name. His first declarations, after
he had been invested with the Ring of the Fisherman,
proved that in the consideration of those momentous
issues that affect and control terrestrial life he was
bent on the suppression of antagonisms and on the
development of fraternal unities. In his first en
cyclical letter, April 2, 1878, with a total disregard of
polemics, he discussed the evils affecting modern so
ciety and appealed to the underlying love of virtue in
the human race. In his second encyclical letter, De
cember 28, 1878, he gently but with inexorable logic
exposed the errors of socialism, communism and
nihilism, and defined the true relations and the recip
rocal obligations of capital and labor, holding with
even hand the balance of justice between the two.
While rebuking the audacity and the crude theories
of anarchical .parties, he demanded that the rich
should help the poor and should pay reasonable
wages for proper service. In June. 1888, he promul
gated an encyclical letter on "Liberty." in which he
asserted the natural freedom of man, and, as an evi
dence of his reasoning power, his submission to the
proper restrictions of government. In May, 1891, his
encyclical letter on the condition of the working
classes appeared, in which he opposed labor con
tracts for the benefit of the few, defended private
property as originating in an inherent right and of
fering a rational motive for labor and for economy,
reiterated his belief that wages should be propor
tioned to work, skill and surrounding conditions,
and advocated workingmen's unions, analogous to
the guilds of the Middle Ages.
The policy of Pope Leo XIII throughout his Pon
tificate was conciliatory and in harmony with modern
progress. He restored friendly relations between the
Papacy and Russia, Germany and Switzerland. He
threw his personal influence into the scale when Car
dinal Lavigerie solicited from the European nations
a common declaration against the revival of the
slave trade in Africa. He closed his long-standing
controversy with Bismarck by an amiable correspon
dence with the first German Emperor of recent
times. He recognized the French republic, and dis
claimed any right of interference with forms of gov
ernment, referring to the United States as "growing
greater and greater every day." "Accept the repub
lic," he said, "that is to say, the power constituted
and existing among you; respect it, and be sub
mitted to it as representing the power that comes
from God."
In his relations with the United States Pope Leo
XIII was peculiarly fortunate, and accepted the
trend of modern ideas in his appreciation of our in
stitutions. On the occasion of his sacerdotal jubilee.
President Cleveland, through Cardinal Gibbons, sent
him a copy of the Federal constitution, and in his re
ply he declared that liberty was guaranteed by that
instrument. When Monsignor Satolli had been ap
pointed his personal representative, in January, 1895,
he addressed a letter to the Archbishop and Bishops
in the United States, in which he referred to our na
tional growth and to the destiny to which we seemed
to be advancing, and expressed his wish that the
Catholic church should "not only share in but help
bring about this prospective greatness." He uttered
words of warning against the turbulence of strikes,
while approving of lawful combinations among the
industrial classes, and bade Catholics to "labor for
the tranquillity of the commonwealth," to "obey the
law," to "abhor violence" and to "seek no more than
equity and justice permit." At a still later period he
alluded to the fact that both Protestants and Catho
lics were among the Regents of the New York Uni
versity, and added: "How then can I complain of
the institutions of America? The more I study them
the more they please me. I have admonished all the
people in America to refrain from strikes, never % to
resort to violence to redress a grievance, but to ap
peal to the law and the constitution."
This great man, in his attitude toward the secular
world, toward the mass of human beings everywhere,
was a powerful and a practical statesman, and, bet
ter than some of our imperialists and annexationists,
comprehended the equality and the significance of
American government and of American civilization.
He avoided the interblending of church and state,
and used his faculties for the benefit of mankind.
Throughout all his papers unity of purpose was ap
parent. As Gladstone once said of Daniel O'Connell,
he had "a passion for philanthropy," which did not,
however, blind him to facts or obscure his reason.
His most intense desire was\that his policy should be
perpetuated after his death, and he repeatedly evinced
his interest in the choice, (if his successor. As "Crux
cruets" was pathetically applied to Pius IX when he
sank to his final sleep, so "Lumen in coelo" will be
the halo with which the world will invest*(he name,
the character and the influence of Leo XIII.

WAIL FACES
A BIG DEFICIT
Deputy Assessor Kline called attention
to the fact that only seventy-three appli
cations ,for reductions !n assessments had
been filed. The first year of Assessor
Dodge's administration more than 500 of
such petitions were submitted to the
board. . On motion of Supervisor Connor
the board expressed its appreciation,. of
the splendid showing made by Assessor
Dodge in the assessment roll as returned
by him.
Clerical errors on the assessment roll,
amounting to a total reduction of $5410
were ordered to ba* corrected.
The petition of. the German Savings and
Loan Society that the assessment on its
bank building on California street be re
duced from $50,000 to $60,000 was denied.
Deputy Assessor Kline stated that the
assessment should be $120,000. based on the
fact that the HIbernia Bank building Is
assessed for $200,000.
Bartlett Doe and J. S. Doe asked for
a' reduction to $160,000 of the $200,000 as
sessment on the St. Nicholas Hotel,
claiming that the theater portion of. the
building Is unproductive, but the board
denied the application.
Action was taken by the board on other
applications as follows: Charles F. Ltb
by, north side of Page street, near De
visadero, reduced from $2500 to $2000; Mrs.
M. McCormick, east side Xoe street, near
Twenty-first street, application for reduc
tion from $j90 to $300 denied: James K.
?Ti*ser > west side of Shrader street, near
Waller', reduced from $4500 to $4000; George
K. Frlnk, improvements northwest side of
Mission street, near Eighth, reduced from
$eoo to $300.
The list of arbitrary assessments re
turned by Assessor Dodge was left un
disturbed, so the assessments will stand.
Herman Rogers pleaded for a reduction
from $20,000 to $10,000 upon real property
on Stockton street, near Vallejo, but the
board fixed the assessment at $15,000.
Connor thought a fair assessment would
be 25 per cent of their assumed value, or
$150,000, and this was agreed to by the
board. This amount includes the*assess
ment on the furniture in the mansion.
Braunhart said for -his part he was In
favor of exempting works of art from
taxation; but the law was plain and had
to be enforced. ", â¢Â¦-
The Board of' Supervisors met yester
day for the purpose of concluding the
equalizing of assessments and began its
labors by placinsr an assessment valua
tion of $150,000 on ,the colledUon of pic
tures and personal property now contain
ed In the mansion of Mrs. Arabella D.
Huntlngton, widow of the late Collls P.
Huntingdon. r '.'â¢
E. Black Ryan, attorney for Mrs. Hunt
ington, appeared before the board, but
Eald he could not place a valuation -upon
the pictures.. Ryan said he had made a
statement to the Assessor to the effect
that he had no knowledge of their value
and askinc that some one .be appointed
to appraise 'the paintings. To comply
with the law he had valued them at $25,
000 for assessment purposes. Ryan said
he did not even know that the pictures
were In existence.
Supervisors Conclude Their
Labors as Board of
Equalization.

The case of Rev. Father Terence Cara
her of St. Krancis Church, who was cited
to appear before Judge Cook to show
cause why he should not be punished for
contempt of court, was called yesterday
morning. Father Caraher was represent
ed by Attorney Garret McEnerney. At
torney George D. Collins was present on
behalf of the lessees of the premises at
1129 Dupont street.
A citation had also been issued against
ChiefÂ» of Police Wittman. but aa it had
not b<en served upon him owing to his
absence in the East Attorney McEnerney
asked for a continuance till the Chief re
turned, so that both cases could be heard
at the same time. The Judge granted a
continuance till August 2.
The allfg^d contempt by Father Caraher
was in inciting the police to disobey the
Injunction ifsued by the Judge in connec
tion with the premises? at 1129 Dupont
meet. In Chief Wittman's case it was
for making arrests of women on the
premises after the issuance of the injunc

Food Strengthens the Mother and
Makes Milk for the Baby.
There are many cases on record where
the use cf the scientific food Grape-Nuts
has produced mill; for a mother in # a few
2 a vs. so she could nurse her baby in the
natural way.
A case of this kind is told by a lady of
Dccatur, Ga.: "When my baby was two
months old I had a very disordered stom-
ach and everything I ate disagreed with
me.
"This worried me so an<I I wu so weak
er.d nervous I was almost wreck and
had to stay in bed most of the time and
the result was that I had to put baby on
the bottle. After trying this for a week
the poor little thing did nrt thrive and I
thought she would surely die.
' "Then alone:, came a friend who begped
me tf^try Grape-Nuts food, although
neither she nor I thought it would cause
me to have nourishment for. baby. But I
concluded to eat Grape-Nuts and began
that came day with good results.
"It was the first food I had eaten for
tnore than three weeks that had agreed
with me ar.d I continued eating it and
gained strength rapidly and after only
twe days' use of this food I was ablo to ,
curee my baby again and In less than a
week I Lad taken her entirely from the
bottle.
"You can imagine what a pleasure this
Is to a mother and I am more thankful
tw Grape-Nuts food on baby's account
than on my own, although Incidentally I
must tell you that I have gained nine
pounds In eight weeks." Name given bjr

"In the Palace of the King," which was
presented most successfully at the Cali
fornia Theater last night, is a wonderful
picture of the strange, life of the Spanish
court four centuries ago. .The. elegance
and frailty of royalty, the power and
majesty of the Church of 'Rome, 'the en
thusiasm and- fickleness of the hoi pollqi,
the haughtiness and humility of the no
bility, : the heroism and; self-sacrifice of
a Caftillan ' grandee and the love and
charity, of a beautiful woman constitute
the basis of a charming story.'/
The play abounds, In thrills for. the blase
and quickened heart-beats for the har;
dened. The manuscript is; replete with
telling lines. The story Is a succession of
sensational incidents.. The actors do fine
ly with their mighty task, even if not all
of their. names are written on scrolls of
histrionic fame. The costumed and stage
settings are both excellent and appro
priate.! . . ' . .-,/â¢-â¢

Miss Bingham was comfortable, gay
and buoyant as -Mrs. \ Frisky. . She
brought humor, . sincerity, t and sympathy
to the part and a. dream-like repertoire
of gowns. The audience' compelled- a
neat speech from the accomplished man
agerâbefore Mr. Lackaye's famous effort,
but Miss Bingham made the! hit;of her
performance by the sweet courtesy with
which she brought Mr." Lackaye to Â» the
front of the stage.
, Mr. Abingdo'n's Frank , Morely was an
other admirable effort, strong . and con-
Mr. Lackaye as Jim Morely, in love
with "Mrs. Frisky," quietly walked o^t
with most of the honors of the perform
ance. He has, it is . true, much the best
opportunity. A large' share of. what good
lines there are fall to him and his part
has been painted at least plausibly by the
author. : But he won again by his natural,
human methods, his quiet drollery, by the
balance, finish and poise of; his work. His
scene with Mr. Abingdon,. where he learns
of Mrs. Johnson's supposed perfidy, was
a little masterpiece of acting. They called
for him after the second curtain until
Miss Bingham forced him to the front
and he unwillingly, began, "Ladies . and
gentlemen, after Miss . Bingham's very
beautiful but obviously prepared speech;
It is unfair of you to ask' me thus unex
pectedly to come before Â¦ you,", etc., etc.;
ending up by inrlting ' us to write to . our
friends to come and see them. In a gale
of laughter each man promised .Mr.
Lackaye and himself that he .would. â¢
The central episode is happy, and in Mr.
Lackaye's, Miss Bingham's and Mr. Ab
ingdon's hands becomes human and touch-
Ing. But these characters, the only pos
sible ones in the play, are surrounded by
a very grab-bag of others. Yet there are
those characteristic touchesâ confetti of
the dramaâ that 'Mr. Fitch throws with
such practiced hand, to be found in ad
mirable abundance. The scenes tire grace
ful and gayâ carnival time in Parisâ and
the setting elegance itself.
The story concerns itself with -the sac
rifice of a supposedly "frisky" sisterâ
the frisky Mrs. Johnsonâ for a reputedly
virtuous One, Mrs. . Frank Mor<?ly. Mrs.
Morely has compromised herself with one
Lord Heathcote, - and the widowed Mrs.
Johnson takes upon herself the onus -of
the affair. But it becomes more serious
than she had anticipated. The brother of
her sister's husband, with whom she her
self is in love, has fallen in love with her,
but learns from his brother of /Mrs. John
son's supposed sin. And here begins the
improbable. V
The person Mrs. Johnson is supposed to
have found the world well lost for is an
intolerable cad, that is, when he is at all
believable. He mostly isn't. It was pat
ently manifest that she could not have
loved him. Nor even her weaker sister
Grace. But granted the possibility, and
the rest becomes thoroughly interesting,
and as it was acted. last night even con
vincing.
/ / PTTS HE fri SKY MRS.. JOHN
6 6 I SON," adapted from .' the
1 French of Gavault and Ber
<H by Clyde Fitch, was present
ed at the Columbia Theater
last night for the first time locally by
Miss Amelia Bingham and her company.
As Mr. Lackaye suggested in his, unc
tuous impromptu, we may "write to our
friends who are out of townâ getting
their noses burntâ to come" and see the
play," or, as Mr. Lackaye did not say, to
come and Bee the people in It. For, dis
tinctly. "The Frisky Mrs. Johnson"
pleased last night, pleased largely, in spite
of itself, but emphatically pleased.
those of us who '.were not out. of town
"getting our noses burnt" signaled . sat
isfaction in unmistakable fashion. I left
off at ten in counting the curtain calls at
the end of the second ait.
The "new andpartly original play from
the French" of the programme defines
Mr. Fitch's relation to ' the comedy. In
Just what the play is original with. Mr.
Fitch is left undetermined, but open to
suspicion. As in the original the scene
is laid in Paris, but with dramatis per-'
sonae of English, French and American
nationalities. Chiefly American. In fact, the
whole atmosphere is tremendously but un
persuaslvely American. Englishing the
French play is ever an ungrateful, task.
The'^averagc result suggests the translat
ing Of a butterfly into a goose, and the
suggestion is not wholly absent here. Au
thor Kitch would, however, seem to be
peculiarly well suited to the Gallic trans
lation, but he has not so shown himself
here. In omittingâ and what so difficult
as the delicate art of omission?â some of
the inevitable Gallic suggestlveness, Mr.
Fitch becomes most un-Fitchly heavy
footed, his people bourgeois Instead of
pay, his situations consequently implausi
ble instead of inevitable.
6t her, role is not. especially ambitious in
many 'respects/ Much better, would not
have suffered at her hands. Bui what she
had r tQ^dp was entirely satisfactory.
! While.it'was a-D'Arville night, it was not
less, unmistakably a triumph for Arthur
Cunningham, who fairly, disputed the hon
ors with D'Arville.. His song of "Kitty
O'Brien'.'- got two recalls and the audience
was not satisfied then. Cunningham
gave a star performance. His .voice has
not been heard to better advantage dur-
Jng the season/ ; Stevens, Hartman, Annie
Myers and AVebb." the fun-making quar
tet of the stock company, had roles that
were ' musically overshadowed by those
of -'D'Arville and Cunningham. Stevens
caught and held the fancy of his auditors
with the gypsy, song, In which he was
abetted by a quartet' from the chorus.
There was much of color in the costum
ing of the' chorus. The audience paid
'"The* Highwayman" the unusual compli
ment of waiting until the-curtain fell the
last time and applauding after, that.

Central.
â¢ The Central Theater scored a great",tri
umph, last night in its productlorf^of the
spectacular drama ''Faust" on a scale of
magnificence seldom attempted In any
theater. ;; The house was deservedly
packed and the succession of elaborate
ecenes was the signal for enthusiasm. The
stage setting was complete In every de
tail.' The new leading man, Herschel
MayalL was ' accorded an ovation, and
time after time he was called before the
curtain to receive popular testimonial of
his sterling merits. In the powerful role
of 'Mephisto he gave a portrayal at all
times convincing and at many points ef
fective to the degree of sublimity. In the
character of Faust Edwin T. Emery ex
celled himself. Miss Eugenia Thais Law.
ton as Marguerite enhanced her reputa
tion as an actress by her superb por
trayal. George P. Webster furnished a
strong piece of acting in the part of Val
entine. The cast Is a very large one,
thqre being some sixty people In the
drama. The spectacular play at the Cen
tral is an Immense hit. The acting, the
scenery and the electrical and mechanical
ingenuity displayed were all noteworthy
in: their several spheres. "Faust" Is as
sured a great week's run. In a^brlef but
felicitous speech at the end of the second
act Mr. Mayall expressed his deep appre
ciation of the honors shown him and paid
a happy encomium to Lewis Morrison,
whom he styled "the prince of actors"
and to. whose, coaching he accorded the
supreme credit for the success of himself
and his fellow players In the performance
of "Faust." â¢ Mr. Morrison and party oc
cupied one of the proscenium boxes.
Orpheum.
I The Orpheum was packed last night,
the feature of the performance being De
Kolta. the .wizard. The appearance and
disappearance of his wife is one of the
most mystifying feats that has ever been
presented to a San Francisco audience.
Alcazar.
i ."The Prisoner of Zenda" has proved one
of thp most notable successes at the Alca
zar Theater during the engagement of
White Whlttlesey, and last night, the
commencement of its second week, there
was' not an empty seat in the house.
Fischer's.
'For unlimited laughter of the genuine
sort- a t visit to Fischer's Theater, where
they are presenting a combined burlesque,
"Under the^ Red Globe" and "Th.e Three
Muskeeters,'; is recommended. .
Grand Opera-House.
/.A fairly good house attended the second
production of '.'In Wall Street" at the*
Grand Opera-house last night. ~ Encores
were freely given 'to the members of the
chorus. They displayed exceptional abil
ity. "Hands" were also ' freely given to
Budd Ross and Anna Wilks, the Esmer
alda sifters and Arnold Grazier.
Grauman's.
Lester and Curtln gave a highly amus
ing acrobatic act at Grauman's last night,
creating roars of - laughter. Hank Whit
comb proved a. good imitator of birds and
animals: and Hathaway and Walton gave
some very .clever sand;, dances.. Little
Blossom, possessed, of a resonant voice,
sang the latest. coon songs; Sara and Ida
Kelly \ gave some excellent Yankee com
edy and the 'rest of the bill, made up of
the best \ acts: from, last week's pro
gramme, was weir received. The daily
matinees are very, popular.

BRIGHTON BEACH. NEW . YORK,
July 3).â Jockey Redfern to-day added
nothing to his reputation as a rider by
his exhibition on Mamie Worth in the
Sea Gull stakes at Brighton Beach. The
Sea Gull was the feature of the card and
Mamie Worth was the popular choice for
the event on the strength of her recent
good performances. She was in receipt of
nine pounds from Astarita and the public
as well as the big speculators did not
believe the latter couid give the weight.
Mamie Worth was one of .the best played
favorites of the day. She might not have
won with a perfect ride, for Astarita was
a good filly to-day. The v.elght- did not
bother her, and she simply galloped home
in 1:13 1-5, after making the pace all the
way. Summaries:

ATLANTIC HIGHLANDS. N. X. Jaly
2O.-Ten mile 3 an 'hour for thirty mUes
windward was the rattling pace set by Sir
Thomas Upton's cup challenger in a race
with Shamrock I In the waters of the In
ternational racecourse off Sandy Hook
lightship to-day. The challenger's exact
time for thirty miles was 2:59:20. very
near record time for a cup event and on
a par with the Reliance's splendid per
formance off Newport in June, when thÂ«
American yacht covered thirty miles in
less than three hours. Shamrock Hl'a
windward leg to-day was, however, not a
beat to windward. A shift in the wind at
the start made it possible for her to fetch
from the starting line to within two miles
of the turn in quicker than if she- had to
beat all the way. Despite her splendid
pace she beat Shamrock I by only one
minute twenty-two seconds elapsed time,
but the new boat had lost at least two
minutes by the parting of her Jib topsail
sheet when she was four miles from tha
finish line. * *

OAKLAND. July 20.â The myste
rious sloop that has "jumped," if
a .vessel can be said to "Jump"
anything, some two or three
thousand acres of oyster bed
lands between San Leandro and San Lo
renzo, is still anchored off Roberts Land
ing with the armed men aboard. No
move has been .made by either side, the
sloop being satisfied with remaining at
anchor and holding under arms the al
leged possession of the oyster beds, while
the original claimants have riot yet made
any special move to oust the sloop and
her armed crew, except to serve, notice
upon them that they are trespassers.
The people whose land has been jumped
are Captain William Roberts of Roberts
Landing, who holds claim to 1500 acres of
oyster bed tide lands; Henry _ U. Marlin
and Mrs. Matilda Marlln. In all some
2500 acres of. valuable water' front lands
have been jumped, surveyed and are now
being held by the armed sloop.
The . vessel Itself Is at present lying
nearly a. mile directly west of Roberts
Landing, one of the best Inlets. along the
Alameda shore south of Oakland harbor.
But little communication is bad with the
shore by < the armed guard of the- sloop.'
The guards have but little desire to min
gle with the shore people whose land
they have jumped, and the shore people
have served the guards a notice
that they are not to trespass on shore as
they have upon the tlde.lands and. water.
DENIED A LANDING.
In the first days of the occupation of
the water front .lands by .the^tlopp., the
surveyors and armed guards attempted
to reach shore at Roberts Landing, which
has turned out to/be the seat* of war - of
the new jumping, deal: But.' Gove Rob
erts soon stopped that. Gove Roberts
happens to be a notary^ public and he
drew up a formidable looking document
frightened in. front of the Fire Depart
ment station. . :,-â¢/--'"

pirate, and there are all kinds of threats
being made.
There is also a growing belief among
those who. hold these oyster bed. titles
to water front lands' that this' seizure is
not being made for the sole purpose of
planting oysters. â¢ ..-.â¢- -
Roberts Landing, the storm ce'ntfer of
this trouble, is one of the most valuable
Inlets on the Alameda side of the bay
shore. There Is 'deep water up to high
land and the inlet' runs -through oyster
beds and t id that passed into private
ownership, through the oyster .bed. law.
This landing would be a very valuable
property for some manjjfactlng or rail
road proposition, and its seizure by an
armed sloop would -mean all kinds of legal
and property troubles. The mystery that
surrounds the operations of the sloop and
its armed crew and the" money, that is
apparently being spent causes the local
land claimants' to think that there la
something besides a mere oyster bed prop
osition involved. - .: - .. '
SHERIFF AS Â¦ A RESERVE.
This la tht statement *^nade by 'Gove
Roberts/ the son of. Captain William Rob
erts, to-night: .
The armed sloop 4s- still -anchored' off our
landing. I have served notice upon those in
charge of it that we. as owners of. the land,
consider them trespassers, and, that we will not
allow them. to cross our. high land to reach their
vessel.* tVe hare not Â¦ yet decided exactly what
course we - will pursue, but' the moment that
they make a move toward building a wharf or,
a warehouse, or anything that could be consld-,
ered a claim upon the land, we will call in the
Sheriff to dispossess them. .If they, choose to
fight the Sheriff. It; is up to thorn. At It Is
now, they seem satisfied with anchoring the
vessel about a mile off ; the shore and - keeping
an armed, guard on her. No one that I 'know
Of has 'been allowed upon the vessel.
We filed upon this property. In 1879 and we,
consider that -me have complied with every
provision of the law and that this is merely a'
piratical Jumping Of our claims. We have even
planted ' oysters this year, which Is something
this crew may not know. â¢ Â¦ .-,.Â»Â».
. They had the audacity to try to land at our
landing after they had . jumped our property,

in their ears, the King t and Queen ; , left

which he covered with notarial seals, an
nouncing that the high land as well as
the water front in question belonged''- to
his father, Captain William Roberts, and
the people who /were jumping the water
front land were warned that they would
not be permitted to cross his father's
property.
As Captain. William Roberts owns In
undisputed sway all of the hich land
back' of Roberts Landing,/ and Thomas
W. Mulford, who is friendly to the RobÂ« !
ertses, owns the land Immediately north
of that, the surveyors were forced to go
some five miles around these claims In
order to reach San Leandro station. â¢
The people -of San Loandro, San Lo
renzo and neighboring settlements arÂ«
not, very friendly to the surveyors and
tide land jumpers of the mysteriousÂ»3loop
and they get very f little sympathy In
tnese communities. The sloop and Its
occupants are generally known as' "the
pirates," but the' local claimants are sat
isfied with calling them this name at long
range and serving written notices that
are passed, aboard. the. vessel in the face
of the. muzzle of a shotgun. It was un
der these .conditions -that Gove Roberts
served his written notices upon the crew

who warned him ' away. He 'asked for

and took the document. "According to Mr.;
Roberts* story theonly reply -he got.
was. "Humph!" = â¢ - \
There has been a' general I unification of
the water front claimants off the eastern

that If the lands of ; Captain Roberts can
be jumped others may suffer as well.

UNIVERSITY EVENTS
TRENTON, N. J., July 20.â Suit to fore
close the mortgage for $16,000,000 on the
property of the United Shipbuilding Com
pany was to-day commenced- in the
United States Circuit Court against
James Smith Jr.,' receiver, by the Mer
cantile Trust Company of New York, as
trustee. The only property of the United
States Shipbuilding Company not covered
by mortgage is the Bethlehem Steel
Works, upon which a mortgage j for
$10,000,000 was previously given to the New
York Security and Trust Company, as
trustee for an Issue of gold bonds.
The Mercantile Trust Company mort
gage covers all the property embraced in
the plants of the Union Iron Works, San
Francisco; Bath Iron Works, Bath,
Maine; Hyde Windlass Company, Bath;
Crescent Shipyard Company and Samuel
L. Moore Sons Company, Elizabeth;
Eastern Shipbuilding Company, New Lon
don, Conn.; Harlan and Hollingsworth
Company. Wilmington, and Canda Manu
facturing Company, Carteret, N. J.
It is alleged that the shipbuilding com
pany defaulted in the sum of S400,(XÂ» due
July 1 for the semi-annual interest pay
ment and In the further sum of $200,000
which was to go into the sinking fund
for the retirement of gold bonds.'
If the move is successful it will practi
cally nullify the victory gained by op
ponents of Sheldon reorganization plan.
In addition, if the mortgage is fore
closed it will mean that the Bethlehem
Steel Company can be immediately . dis
membered from the ill-fated Shipyard
Trust. It Is likely" that a, vigorous fight
will be waged between the different Inter
ests. On one elde is arranged the Mer
cantile Trust and members of the Shel-'
don-Schwab reorgani2ation' committee,
while on the other hand there will be
numerous bondholders who . have sup
ported the campaign carried on by Mr.
Untermeyer. It is stated that some sen
sational testimony will -be taken in the
stiit. Mr. Smith, receiver, is now prepar
ing data to show the status and 'earning
capacity of each of the subsidiary, plants.
An attempt will also be made to secure
the contracts entered into between the
promoters, the owners of ship yards and
the Trust Company ..of, thÂ« Republic In
this way an effort will be made to show
where the $8,100,000 cash received by the
Shipyards Company has gone.
..On the question of foreclosure. Chair
man Conklin, bt the protective committee,
says:
The $10,000,000 collateral bonds are secured
by a ntcrtgbge on the Bethlehem Eteel plant
and a second mortgage on the shipbuilding
plants. A clause in this collateral mortgage
proposes to give the holder the Â¦â¢ right to an
immediate foreclosure In case of default. in in
terest on the first mortgage -bonds, even if the
interest on the Bethlehem steel plant bonds is
paid. Forclosure under our own first mortgage
cannot be made until ninety days after de
fault, and if the holders of the majority of the
bonds conclude to waive the default they have
the power to do m. -
He eaid that an appeal will certainly be
made to the courts to prevent any such
proceedings.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center Street, July 20.
Somewhere in some San Francisco hotel
or lodglng-hduse is a trunk anl valise
that belonged to the unknown dÂ»ad man
lying in the local Morgue and about whose
death near the Brennan barn on the San
Pablo road last Friday night there is so
much mystery.
If this trunk and valise could be found
the cloud hanging over the man's identity
would l>e Instantly cleared and perhaps
some- light might be thrown. on the ques
tion of whether murder or suicide was the
cause of his death. And the clew to these
properties of the man is the two keys that
were found In the pockets of his clothing.
They are mute evidence that he had a
trunk and valj&e.
Examination of these instruments re
veals that one of them Is a trunk key
and the other a valise key. They are at
tached to a key ring and chain and are
the only keys on it. Both are made of
steel. Neither bears a mark of. any kind
on the handle that would indicate the
name or initial of the owner.
It is pretty certain the man lived in San
Francisco, though there is no direct evi
dence on that point. The thing that leads
the investigators to believe that he lived
there is the ferry ticket found in the
pockets. This ticket reads. "San Francis
co to Sausallto and return" and is punch
ed once. How the man could ha ve_ re
tained the ticket, however, If he made' the
round trip, is one of the inexplicable cir
cumstances in tha case. The theory Is
that he- must have ridden to Sausalito
and purchased another ticket to return on
or met a friend who bought a ticket for
him. â¢ Â¦
WOMAN SAW HIM LAST.
So, . as the only evidence obtainable
makes San Francisco the man's residence,
be must .have had a room there in which
are contained his belongings.
Through the efforts of the newspaper
men engaged in unraveling the mystery
the man's movements were to-day traced
tcr the very hour of his death.' Mrs. An
nie E. Wilson, whose son discovered the
man's body, is found to be the person
who saw him last on the day of the trag
edy. iShe left Berkeley the- day the body
was found and did not return until to
day. Her story is as follows:
- I saw the man walkinr past my placÂ» Fri
day evening about 7 o'clock. He walked very
â¢lowly and carried an overcoat, on hla arm. He
was. walking; in the direction of Brennan's
barn' on San Pablo avenue. The barn is only
a, short distance from my house, and. In a few
moments he disappeared behind It. That was
the last I saw of him until the next day, when
my con came to tell me a tramp was sleeping
behind the bam. I went there and tried to
wake him up and then discovered he was dead.
My attention was attracted to the man by
hla weli'dressed appearance. He didn't look like
a tramp at all. I thought he was simply going
to the next house on business. | but he walked
so slowly, and it is so lonely out here at that
hour of the night, that I could not help won
dering about him. The barn where he met his
death is full of tramps almost e\try night,
and I shouldn't wonder but they killed him.
thinking he bad some money.
ASKED FOR BURCHER.
Connor Bros, of the Blue Front saloon,
at Third and Harrison streets, added
something to the story of the man's wan
derings to-day. The man was in their
place about 1 o'clock on Friday. He first
asked for a' drink of water and then In
quired for E. R- Burcher, who formerty
was the proprietor of the place.
"Is Mr. Burcher here any more?" he
asked of the Connors. - -.~.~*. : i
"Well, then, I'll go 1 to his house."
i The Connors showed him the way and*
he went off toward the Burcher house. A
little later he did appear at the Burcher
house,, but he did not see Burcher. He
saw Mrs. Burcher instead, by whom he
was accommodated with a drink of water.
"I don't believe he knew Burcher at
all," said F. A. Connors to-day. "He
Vanted.a drink and thought he might get
it on the strength of a pretended friend
ship for Burcher." 'Â»ri-'
Burcher was shown the newspaper pic
tures of the man and said he had never
seen him before. .
"I don't remember ever having seen any
such man," said he. "It's strange why
he should ask for me. He may have
heard my name while he was visiting the
other saloons around here, but I'm sure
I know nothing about him.'*
KNEW SALOONS WELL.
The man's observations at the various
saloons*, he visited show that he .-â¢ was
-pretty well acquainted with the saloon
traffic In Berkeley. At Carman's place he
said: "I'm glad the American; Hotel
down the road didn't get a license.. It's
a good thing they closed all. those speak
easies within the mile limit." And at
Connors' place he spoke as if he were fa
miliar with its history. At the same time,
he does "not appear to have been a drink
ing man; for he took -water in the two
saloons he te known to' have visited.
The man's actions lead, some of the in
vestigators to believe that he was a. Gov
ernment officer sent from the East to con
duct investigations into the liquor traffic.
It is possible â¢ that he may have . been
murdered by- men engaged in the illicit
manufacture of liquor whom he had dis
covered. But the question comes back.
What was he doing at the barn at' 7
o'clock? â¢ ' ' . s, ..-..
.Additional, weight was added to the
murder theory to-day by, the discovery
that the gold-bowed glasses the man wore
Â¦were fitted for a left-handed person.
When found the man was gripping, the
pistol '-In- the .'right ".hand. If he was a
left-handed ; person it is- not likely . that
he shot himself \vi th . his right hand and
tbi# fact bears out the theory that the
pistol was put into the roan's hand by hla
murderers after his death.

The battalion maneuvers this morning
were' the best seen at a camp of tue
League of the Cross in many years. The
first battalion, made up of Companies A,
G, M, O and C, wtre put through a severe
tfriH by Sergeant A. Smith of the Twenty
ninth Infantry. I*. 6. A. The cadets
charged, deployed, countermarched and
rÂ»-t reared in perfect order. . The officers
showed themselves familiar with the tac

materially. The second and third bat-
Hor.s wore drilled in the use of the

::iicd States Army.
N". Moscowitch. a watchmaker employed
by M. Schussler & Co., wholesale Jewel
ers, In the Spreckels Annex on Market
street, was the victim of an exciting ex
perience last evening that was not wttli
out its ludicrous features and one that he
will long remember.
It is the custom of the firm to close the
establishment at 5 o'clock evtry afternoon
and accordingly it the appointed time M.
Schussler. the senior member of the firm,
took his departure, locking the door after
him. It so happened that Moscowitch was
busily engaged at work In the rear of the
store and did not hear his employer leave.
. About an hour later he -laid down his
tools and after satisfying hlmseff that
everything was all right started to depart.
The door was closed and locked, however,
and the Imprisoned watchmaker knew
that a turn of the handle would set the
burglar alarm in motion, as every avenue
of Ingress and egress was protected in
this manner.
Hemmed In on all sides by burglar
alarm wlrrs and unresponsive cases of
jewelry. Moscowitch was at a loss to
know what to do. He gave vent to sev
eral calls with the hope of attracting tile
janitor or elevator operative. In his dis
traction he went to the telephone to call
up his employer, who resides in Oakland.
In the meantime, however, some one who
had been attracted by hl.Â» cries went to
the door and turned the knob.
B-r-r-r-r went the clockllke mechanism
in the Central burglar alarm office and
the bells tapped a number. The operator
sprang: to his feet. "Some bold cracks
men are at work in Schuaaler & Co.'s
store," he exclaimed. Two of the sleuths
employed by the company were at once
dispatched to the scene.
With trembling fingers they placed the
pass key In the lock and opened the door,
expecting to catch the intrepid crooks and
establish an international reputation as
Hawkshaws. They were* confronted by
Moscowitch. who told them who he was
and how he happened to get into the pre
dicament they had found him. He was
allowed to depart and his two liberators,
somewhat crestfallen, returned to their
post. â¢ r w r.;. -â¢Â¦:;,:;;

General J. B. Cogden^of New York, who
is head of the American Silk Association,
which controls the raw silk market in
this country, returned ' yesterday from
Japan, where he has been looking over
the silk culture situation for several
months. He stated last, evening at the
Palace Hotel that the demand for the
raw material has lately been falling off
noticeably, a fact which is attributed, to
several reasons. One of them, he said,
is 'the. fact that the people of this coun
try and England are now using linen
handkerchiefs instead of those of silk,
and another is that the Italian crop of
silk having diminished, the . Japanese
promptly raised the. price of their mate
rial, which reduced the 1 orders' for the
Oriental product. Over half of the prod
uct of Japan, General Cogden said, is Im
ported to this country.

There was a dispute as to the law In
the case. It was conceded that If the
acts complained of had been committed
the Injunction should be issued to pre
vent a repetition of the anarchistic acts,
but the counsel for the defense Introduced
affidavits denying that the pickets had
been guilty of acts of violence or Intimi
dation. It was contended that the pick
ets used only peaceful persuasion and
would not for the world attempt to frigh
ten a non-union man or woman 1 from
working for the bag company during the
strike.
The company was represented by 8. O.
Houghton and H. B. Montague and the
strikers by Bert Schleslnger and Police

were ml on behalf of the petitioners.
In which charges were made that certain
of the defendant strikers threatened and
Intimidated employes of the company,
and, in one Instance,- used a club on the

fidavits recites that thre* of the strikers
approached a non-union girl working In

manner, called her a vile name reflecting

The Best Way East
If yoa enjoy grand scenery there's
only one way for you to go eastâ via
Salt Lake City, Denver and the Bur-
lington Route, the eceaic line across
the continent.
Burlington tonrist cars by this way
leave California three times a week for
the East. There are no changes or
delaysâ yon go right through to Omaha
and Chicago, or Kansas City and
EL Louis. Connections at these cities
for all points beyond.
Scenic attractions are not all â will be
glad to toll yon about the others.
Call if you can, but write me a line
if you can't.

NEW YORK. July 20.â Liquidation was still
manifest In to-day's market. The actual sell-
Ing pressure was consented In Individual stocks.
The volume of activity was not great In the
general list and the drooping tendency of the
market seemed to be largely In sympathy with
the weakness shown by special stocks. Pro-'
regional bear tactics played a part in the
day' 8 declines, as was shown by the occasional
rallies. But the demand on this account seemed
to be soon satisfied, and there was no disposi
tion to pursue the buying on any advance. ThÂ«
high grade railroad stocks were less conspicu
ous In the weakness and showed some early
positive resistance to depression. . But the
weakness became general before the day ended.
High priced Inactive stock? continued to suffer
severely. Lacka wanna broke 11 a , to 230 on a
single transaction and Immediately rallied sev
eral points, but sold as low as 235 later. The
old Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific stocks
sold at 145, compared with the preceding sale
last January at 200. Various securltlee em
braced In the widely ramified Rock Island sys
tem were under severe pressure. Including Rock
Island common, which sold at a new low record
at 25. Suggestions of a project for a new divi
sional arrangement of the system Involving a
heavy Issue of refunding bonds were published
during the day. It waa believed also that the
holdings of Rock Island which were acquired
as a result of the absorption of the St. Loulf
and S&n Francisco were sought to be dislodged
and forced upon the market by the attacking
bears. Another center of disturbance wan
Amalgamated Copper, which dropped to 44%, a
new low record. The selling of this stock was
unexplained by any new developments, but its
weakness aroused mitiglvlngs among sharehold
ers as to the affairs of the corporation and in
duced additional selling. Colorado Fuel and
Iron's fall to 50 was accompanied by' rumors
of the necessity of new Issues to take care of
loans which have been made. United States
Steel sold at 25. and its weakness was a fac
tor in the general depression of sentiment.
Sugar's break to a low record for the year was
also not without influence on sentiment. The
market had a fairly good rally on the hour,
but loft nearly ail of it again before the clon
ing, which was weak. Money was slightly
easier, if anything, and the market for sterling
exchange hardened, apparently In response.
Operators in stocks felt little hope of any de
mand ti>r securities, while active competition
for funds in the money market goes on among
railroad corporations and wealthy individuals.
ThÂ« weekly ctatistlcs of railroad traffic show
rather a notable decline In the grain move
ment, but general merchandise continues to
move in large bulk, and railroad officials pro
fess an expectation of an unprecedented traffic
this fall. â¢ .
There were eome points of resistance In the
bend market, but other points showed weak
ness. Total Bales (par value). $1,585,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on the
last call.

Dealers 'generally quoted a dragging market
for Butter, with concessions given to large and
close buyers. Receipts from the north were
larger than of late. / â¢
Eggs rule steady and a very fair demand
keeps stocks down to a manageable point.
Cheese shows considerable change. Flats are
generally .quoted %c higher, with smaller and
decreasing .supplies. This Is -the time of the
year when the production falls off, and re
ceipts of domestic goods will therefore run
lighter from now . on. Â¦ Young Americas are
scarce and higher, the market in fact being
cleaned up. Eastern is lower, as there Is a
good deal rolling this way. - ;
Receipts were 85,700 lbs Butter, 1436 cases
Eggs and 29,400 lbs Cheese.

SAN RAFAEL. July 20.â Not satisfied
with his own political downfall Warden
Agulrre is now -seeking 1 to drag others
with him. Absolutely without cause he
ha3 used his official position on tne eve of
his departure to discharge attaches of,
the penal Institution whose term, of office
has been long and whose competency has
never been questioned. Wlthtn the past
three weeks Aguirre has given six guards
their walking papers. Two of these had
served the State faithfully tor nearly
three times as long a period as the pres
ent Warden- himself has been in office.
Up to to-day only guards and petty of
ficials suffered from Aguirre's wrath, but
this morning William Byrnes, the over
seer of the Jute mill, was told to leave
and subjected to further humiliation by
sending with him a guard when he en
tered the prison walls In order to obtain
some personal effects in his office. M.
Gtlleran, a^, guard who was discharged to
day, was. notified last night that he neeJ
not show up for work, but Byrnes was
not aware of his dismissal until he was
entering the outside gate of the prison
wall at 8 o'clock this mornlnsr.
It is asserted upon good authority that
many more guards will be dismissed.
A man from Fresno has been selected
to succeed Byrnes, the discharged super
intendent of the lute mill.
Hugh Fraser has for many years been
a man of affairs in this community. He
was Supervisor in 1880-81, and it was due
to his efforts that an . appropriation of

which is still In use. â¢

Simcich was taken to a physician, some
what weak from loss of blood, and sev
enteen stitches were taken in his. scalp.
He is well and favorably known and his
been emDloyed by Robert Kern. & Co.,
retail liquor dealers at 634 Market street,
for a number of years. At every Aus
trian celebration he has been unanimous
ly chosen to officiate as grand marshal.
The news spread \lke wildfire through
the grounds and there was 6oon a.howl
ing mob In the barroom, varies of "Get
a rope and lynch them!'* were heard from
all sides.. The infuriated crowd made a
rush for the fellows, and before they / were
finally rescued 'by the police they had
been roughly . handled.
They were taken to the Central sta
tion and their names entered on the deti
nue book. There is no doubt ,that the
attempted robherv was the result of a
deep laid plot and the police believe that
several others were connected with the
affair. Captain Martin f has detailed two
of his shrewdest men on. .the. case, ..but
up to a late hour last night no further
arrests had been made. .' . ,
THREATS- OF LYNCHING.
One of the thugs, who was subsequent
ly arrested, had crept up behind him
armed with a heavy beer glass, which
he brought down with crushing force on
SImcich's head. Simcich reeled and fell
to the ground and the two men then
started toward the prostrate form. That
It was their purpose to secure the coin
was evident, but before they could carry
out their design several of the picnickers
who had witnessed the affair- rushed to
the scene and grabbed them. '
About 4:30 o'clock it was found that a
crowd of hoodlums had succeeded in scal
ing the fence on the western side of the
grounds. Simcich, who had officiated ' as
master of ceremonies and grand marshal
of the parade, scented trouble as soon as
he saw them. He therefore gave orders
that the barroom in the upper portion of
the grounds be closed. Thinking no more
of the matter he repaired to the box of
fice and made up cash. The receipts of
the day amounted to nearly (900 and this
amount he placed In his pocket in a can
vas bag. He then strolled over to the
bar and while engaged in conversation
with a friend, the cook, who had been
employed at the barbecue, approached him
and asked for some money on account.
Simcich put his hand in his pocket and
handed the man $3. His back at this time
was turned to the door, and he was total
ly unaware of the blow he was about to
receive.
CLIMB OVER FENCE.
Nothing occurred to mar the day's
pleasure until late in the afternoon, when
the Intrepid crooks attempted to hold up
Mr. Simcich and secured possession of
the gate receipts, which were In his
charge. It Is regarded as miraculous
that the blow he received with a beer
glass did not fracture his skull and it
will be some time before he Is able to at
tend to his business.
The Austrian Military and Benevolent
Association' is the representative organiza
tion of the Austrian colony in this city
and it, has been the custom for many
years to give an annual picnic, target
shoot and barbecue. Glen Park was
selected for this year's festivities and
the affair was attended by an- Immense
crowd. A parade through the principal
streets preceded the trip to the pleasure
grounds.
As the result of a daring and ineffectual
attempt to steal $900 during the progress
of the picnic given Sunday at Glen Park
by the Austrian Military and Benevolent
Association, two men are in custody at the
City Prison and Joseph Simcich, a well
known Austro-American and grand mar
shal of the organization, is confined to his
bed, nursing a scalp wound that necessi
tated seventeen stitches.
