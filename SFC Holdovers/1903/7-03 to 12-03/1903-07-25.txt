THE mystery surrounding the death
of Captain Thomas Howard, whose
bullet-riddled body, found just, a
week ago behind a barn in West
Berkeley, haÂ«= assumed proportions of as
tounding magnitude. From Dawson City
to New York there stretches a' web of evi
dence fraught with significance.
During the last year Captain Howard
was the victim of a gigantic fraud, upon
the successful consummation of which
would have depended the loss of prop
<ity of almost unlimited value. Over his
own clgmnture he had confessed himself
wary cf one of the conspirators against
him who had once killed a man and would
not hesitate to shoot him. During his
entire stay in Ban Francisco he would
not so out on the Etreets after Â¦ dark
unaccompanied.
-On Saturday last he was found lying
beside Brennan's barn in West Berkeley
with two bullet holes through his head
end a frightful fracture of the skull.
From the papers of the dead man. now
In the hands of the Coroner at Berkeley,
there Is gleaned a story which may throw
a Btrong llgrht upon the tragedy which
was enacted in the dark hours of the
night behind the 'lonely barn in West
Berkeley. They chow the stake for

BICH CLAIMS THE PRIZE.
Captain Howard was the possessor of
1600 acres of mining property situated on
IndlanTUver, in the heart of the richest
gold fields of the Klondike district. This
had been awarded to him by the Govern
ment of British Columbia as a reward of
meritorious services rendered in the Red
River rebellion of 1SC3. It Is about this
that there is hinged the drama which had
it* climax behind Brennan's barn In West
Berkeley.
By the dead man's papers, now in
the hands of the authorities, it Is shown
that in December, 1S01. he was in New
York endeavoring to form a company to
work his concession on the Indian River.

whose office Is at 133 Broadway, he be

The tffect of the Taylor 'failure upon
James R. Keene's personal affairs is pure
ly a matter of conjecture. According to
some reports .the 'veteran .operator is
heavily Involved, and according to others,
scarcely. at all.- There are many who be
lieve that the Taylor failure Is directly
due to the bad blood stirred up by the
firm and, Keene In the Southern Pacific
and Metropolitan suits. In fact, it has
frequently been". said. that the Harriman
and Whitney Interests would not.be sat

' Report sava that Taylor & Co. sold pri
vately to a large banking Interest, which
it. some time ago , antagonized, 40,000
chare* of Southern Pacific. - - ,
A great deal of interest was manifested
in Wall street as to the cause of the sus
pension . of T. J. j Taylor & Co., and to
what extent, if at all, James R. Keene
was Involved In It. The general belief in
the street was that Mr. Keene had. no
connection, but that he refused' to come
to the relief of his son-in-law. There was
no confirmation of this notion, but it is
based on the following etory:
Last summer Talbot J. Taylor was re
ported to have had a falling out with Ms
father-in-law, arising out of reported pur
chases of Southern Pacific by Taylor on
his own account,' Independently of the
pool which Keene was running in that
stock. According to the story, Keene
was angry when he . discovered the, fact.
With the break in the stock market last
October Southern Pacific declined severe
ly and It was . asserted In some quarters
that Taylor was among the losers. Stnce
that time Keene has not been much in
the office of T.J. Taylor & Co.. but this
probably was due to the fact that he was
ill at hlÂ» hotel. - â¢ , : ;
Foxhall l Keene, who is an International
sportsman, is a special partner' In the
sum. it is eald, of $250',o00. He is now
abroad. His father was at the tatter's
office to-day\ bat denied himself to all but
a few close friends.
It was the veritable "black Friday."
an- although the market rallied very de
cidedly at the close and the general sit
uation in the minds of some was much
improved, the great many persons haying
Interests in. the, street went home In any
thing but a- cheerful frame of mind.
It- was freely predicted that trouble
even more serious was Impending.' From
trustworthy sources It was learned that
three or more commission houses had
been "squeezed" almost to the bursting
point. ' ' â¢ " '
Contracts made to-day hold out till
Monflay. which may- enable embarrassed
Individuate to get their second wind.
The best Indication is that the Insolvent
firms had comparatively few outstanding
commitments, and these, it *is believed,
were settled privately on the floor.
It Is paid that a prominent International
banking j bouse, with Important railroad
interests in Mexico, bought liberally to

While these men , were eagerly grabbing
up all Che available land in' this and other
coaBtVStateiV.Harrimaiivwas figuring on
the. future and /wondering what his lands
in the far :Â»West would finally net him.
During vWs'cohtemplatioffi of the profits
that his big railroad would some day de
rive, a friend took, the magnate Into his
confidence and unfolded a scheme where
lng the greater part of the timber output
of West mlght.be guaranteed to a
syndicate for time -Indefinite. , â¢ ;
Harriman, after mature deliberation,
thought the scheme plausible and later,
after a conference with other of his busi
ness associates, It was pronounced feas
ible. Then Weyerhaeuser was taken into
the .camp of the Harriman people, and
through the lumber king, it is said, the
plans were finally put Into shape and con
siderably; broadened. .
The greater- portion of the land In the
West, .valuable for its timber growth; lies
either along the railroads leading to' or
down the coast or within an accessible
distance from the great railway systems
which, are controlled by the Harriman
and the Hill interests, and better still,
the major part of -this rich timber acre
age is already owned by the roads. It
was the shrewd foresight of the experi
enced Weyerhaeuser that suggested to
Harriman the advisability of taking Hill
intoi the scheme, for It ,was shown that
without him the contemplated monopoly
elry, pathetic entries in the diary of petty
expenditures and a host of despairing let
ters from his wife, tell the tale. of Cap
tain Howard's heroic fight against the
odds which opposed him. . . ' !

Hassell Auditing" Company and interested
him and J. B. Treanor, of 501 Montgomery,
street! In his rich concession. Of his deal
ings with Captain Howard sllassell said
yesterday: .-.-â¢.
: : *'I met Captain Howard on June 6 and
met his. Bcbemes with approbation. Wd
had several conferences and finally I told
Â¦.him that 'if he could" give us an expert's
opinion on the prbperty we would prob
ably, start a company. Â¦ -
Â¦ "But he had a haunting fear of some
: people,' whose names he would not reveal,
who 'he said were trying to get his prop
erty away from- him. Â¦ â¢ Â¦";
j "He was afraid to stay away ~from his
concession and wanted get . back as

Â» !'Hls fears perplexed me. On the night
of July 4 we were walking on the street
together and he told me that he never
went out at night without, company. -
"The last I saw of him was on Satur?
day,; a week before his body was found.
Then he said he was going to leave for
Victoria that night. He seemed always
In the best possible spirits and the rumor
that he committed suicide I think with

years as the lumber i kings of the Middle
Westâ have' sought to. , perpetuate their
names' in the increasing -Industry- farther
t V* ho West/"; They \were shrewd, however,
to .feailie thatHhe time was not ripe for
beginning, operations on .their new lands,
because' the prlce.;'of;itlmber has bee/i
steadily 'advancing and',; the Government
statisticians) have.- been sending out figures

Sell at what -prlce^ they may see fit. the
traffic resulting from the cutting ot the
timber will be assured their roads and
if the figures of the Government statisti
cians may be relied upon this monopoly
will extend. over a time Indefinite. Since
the Harriman folks began . working out
their plan . for a combine the prices of
California timber lands have been stead
ily advancing. The price of redwood land
alone has almost doubled, and the* de
mand has increased threefold. During
the last three years the demand for Cali
fornia flr in the East has Increased 50
per cent and the demand for sugar pine
has 'increased proportionately. It Is esti
mated by the Government - officials that
3,000,000,000 feet of timfver was cut In Cali
fornia, Oregon and Washington last year,
and that the product still In sight: In the
three State's is over 600,000,000,000 feet.
whlch^ allowing , for" an | Increased . con
sumption every year, means that there
will be timber to cut in the States men
tioned for the next 1D0 years.
It: is upon these figures that Harriman
and his associates In the big deal are said
to be tnaXlng. their calculations for an
enormous revenue. Â¦
.With the lands of the H'.ll and the Har
riman roads and those of Walker, Weyer
haeuser and others In Washington. Ore
gon, Idaho and California under control,
Harriman and his associates will be in a
position to dictate terms to nearly the en
tire world. â¢
According to the information that has
come to light Eberlin has been working
In a roundabout way toward securing op
tions on Â¦ timber land held by: various.
Eastern people who purchased it since the
boom in California timber began about
three years ago. Among those whom
Eberlin' s agents are said to have I ap
proached with a view of securing options
on their holdings is A. L. Hopkins, a resi
dent of Pennsylvania, I who owns 40,000
acres of sugar pine near Klamath, one
of the most valuable tracts In the West;
Dave Whiting, formerly of Detroit, who
pwns 100,000 acres In Oregon: C. A. Smith
of Minneapolis, who has holdings in the
sugar pine district above Sacramento
and a large -strip of fir timber in the
southwestern part of Oregon; the Ham
mond . Lumber Company, owners of the
big tracts of redwood on the coast, and
the Stewarts, who purchased what la
known as the Scott & Van Arsdale In
terests in Northern Shasta County. Many
of these owners refused to listen to the
propositions of Eberllir's agents, but
others are said to have put a price on
their properties ahd they are now within
reach of the Haniman representatives.
'-With the. many minor holdings which
Harriman and his associates may count
on it is said that the plan is to merge
tfle more . valuable lands controlled by
the Hill roads and the Southern Pacific
into a trust., The Southern Pacific's prin
cipal holdings are represented In the
grant of ten miles on each side of its
road, lying between the southern boun
dary .line of Oregon and a point south of
Portland, and consist of about one mill
ion acres of flr and sugar pine. In Tils
plan to place these lands In a pool Har
riman does- so conditionally, with provis
ions for the protection of the company's
creditors, to whom all the lands of the
company are pledged In security for its
indebtedness.
would never be effected, as Hill would
at all times have a timber territory of
his own with, which to compete with and
the prices wouUpnot be assured for any
great length of time. Just what arrange
ment was entered into between Hurriman
and Hill no one here is able to say. but
the story Is that .Weyerhaeuser accom
plished the end desired and proceeded with
the big project. .
One of the first deals made by him is
said to, have been a transfer of six mil
lion acres of timber land In Washington
to, his .company by the Northern Pacific,
this .about three years ago. This land
lies between the Sound and the Columbia
Rivtr,'jind Is rich in fir. Later Weyer
haeuser.'added to his possessions between
two and three million acres' of timber in
Idaho, the majority* of which was pur
chased from the Hill companies.
Weyerhaeuser suggested that it was
time .for Harriman to begin negotiating
with 'other and smaller holders in the
West who had been buying up land, and
acting upon this suggestion the railroad
president is said to have sent his agent,
E. W.EbÂ«rlln, to the coast for that pur
.ppse. Eberlin arrived herd several months
ago and when in the city he has dwelt
at the, Palace. H.e has conducted \$0
business quietly, dealing with everybody
through a representative. In fact he ha^*
been so discreet that.no one at the Palace
has ever guessed that he Is an agent of
Harriman or any other great promoter.
He has denied himself to all callers and
has refused to make any statement to
press representatives who have attempted
to interview him.

"From what you state and from the

following telegram of July 29 to Clay: r .
"Do not alleged; report
which -is false in every particular and
the statftments in report are lies of Tay
lor's. .Notify Coholan that his notice is
premature as Taylor has not, as he ad
mits,* had time to examine property suffi
ciently." â¢ . â¢ .-
Meanwhile Captain Howard- had been
assured by E. H. Bennett, a mining ex
pert at Dawson, that the property was of
great value. He reported that the hy
draulic tests which he had made showetf
the highest average of $4 50 per cubic
yard.
It became evident that Coholan and his
associates meant to take advantage of
expert Taylor's adverse report to bring
suit for the property on the ground that
the owner, had misrepresented its value.
A letter from Clay dated July 30 warned
Captain Howard of this as follows: '
"Yesterday I called to eee Mr.. Coholan
pursuant to your request. He read me
telegrams and letters received from Tay
lor, and Jhey were to the effect that your
property Contained ' no conglomerate
whatever, that It was worthless, and that
the Ignorance which you displayed con
cerning your property was colossal. V
â¢ "Coholan Is very much exercised over
the outcome of this matter and charges
you' with obtaining , money ; under false
pretenses. He' 6ven threatens to \ have
you indicted if you come back to New
York.
â¢fit seems to me that Taylor is not giv
ing you, the same information In regard to
his investigations as he is giving Coholan.
I understand Taylor is examining other
gold mining property iri.Yukon Territory
besides your own for Mr. Coholan and his
associates. I would, advise you -* by " all
means to ascertain exactly what he is do
ing there, as It' may have an important
bearing on your business." . '
. This letter awoke Captain Howard to a
sense of, his peril and in a reply, dated
August 23." he stated /that he had more
than' one danger to fear.' He wrote: Â¦
"I : can't believe It possible that I have
been'. associated' with' such r a scoundrel.- I
"You. will Bee the' whole game in this; it
has been a put-up Job from the beglnnlng;
"I write this merely to'^hdw you what'a

have found him out.' I won't spare him.
But he has already killed one man, and I
do not intend giving" him a chance" of
drawing his' gun on me.' . \
t "I. am worried, as you. can understand,
but won't be swindled put of a property
that Is ot immense value." ,",
HIS SUSPICIONS â¢SUPPORTED.
.That Captain Howard's opinion â¢ of the
fraud being practiced on him was shared
by others is shown by the following letter
from F. Congdon, an 'attorney., of Daw
son:, ' '". ' -Â¦ '.. r --'' /:,'-Â¦ Â¦'Â¦'.'Â¦ . 'Â¦ f'Z ?-Â¦-'.' :'~
i SUSPICIONS AROUSED. .
.From the correspondence both in writ
ing and in cipher telegram which
passed between Ca^ta* Howard and his
attorney during, the next few months it
becomes evident that the former thought
himself the victim of a gigantic fraud,
the result "of which wduld be to rob him
bfr his concession. That his belief was
well founded . is attested by letters
from legal advisers. His first suspicions
found vent in a letter written to Attor
ney Clay in New York on July 26. It Is
in part as follows: -
. "I had been looking forwards . to . re
ceiving some word , from Coholan' when
Qn .the 23d I said to Taylor. 'As you know.
I hav# not sent word of Any kind, to Clay,
l/'thmk I must do so, as all this V delay
means' unnecessary delay.'. He at once
said to do so. I said: 'Well, then," you
must let me know the nature of yobr let

replied^ that he had not kept a .copy ot

English Sovereign Says Pope Leo's
Memory Is Cherished.
ROME. July 24.â Every effort Is being
made In the Vatican to prevent news of
a scandal leaking out. The ring of the
fisherman, which should have been found
on the hand of the Pope, has disappear
ed. It is not so much a question of its
material as of its extrinsic value, for the
ring of the fisherman is used to seal pa
pal bulls and is an outward sign of the
authority of the Pope.

the death of the .Pope he receives the

In the presence of all the Cardinals at
the first meeting of the Sacred College
held after the Pope's death. But when
Cardinal Oreglla, the present camerllngo,
had certified to the death of Leo XIII,
Monsignor Blslettl was a prey to the
deepest despair and had to admit that
the ring had disappeared. ( Cardinal Oreg
lia, who had, as is the custom, brought
his declaration of having received the
ring from the papal chamberlain, all
written out, had to put it back into his
pocket. Monslgnor Bislettl can^give no
indication as to the robber. The disap

it is the solÂ© subject of conversation.

HONOLULU, July 2t.â Three soldiers,
named Bales, Carleton and Walton, un

eecured their temporary release from im
prisonment through military influence on
the promise to remain on the islands for
trial. Before the time set for the hearing
of the case in court they took passage
to the United States, where they are now
supposed to be, though their exact where
abouts is unknown. The authorities at
Honolulu sent a protest, explaining the
circumstances, to Adjutant General Cor

choice of a new Pope. It leaked
out this morning that M. Delcasse, the
Foreign Minister, told the French Car
dinals, as well as Monsignor Lorenzelll,
the papal nuncio, yesterday that France
desired the election of Cardinal Rampolla,
or, at least, a Rampollist government.
The Government thinks that In order to
Insure a peaceful solutfon of the
ecclesiastical troubles at present raging in
France the policy of Leo must be con
tinued. An' arbitrary Pope would greatly
complicate France's difficulties.
Moreover, the Government is Intensely
Interested in the question of the Catholic
protectorate in the Orient, which the elec
tion of Cardinal Vannutelll, it is believed,
would throw into the hands of the Kaiser.
The French Government desires at all
cost to continue at least its protectorate
over French Catholics in the East, even If
it must give up to Germany its rights
over the Catholics of other nations in
that region.
Delcasse undoubtedly took up a strong
position when he summoned the French
Cardinals to a conference at the Foreign
Office Just before their departure for
Rome. In this he showed as much deter
mination as though France still remained
one of the official bulwarks of the papacy.
This show of authority has greatly In
censed a great many Catholics of the
middle classes, but it is pretty generally,
recognized by the whole body of the
French church as a sign of the strength
of" the present Government.

GOTTI'S CHANCES BRIGHT.
ROME, July 24.â All interest now cen
ters In the coming conclave and Its re
sult. The gossip of the day may be
summed up briefly by saying that Car
dinal Gotti's chances of election seem to
have Improved in comparison with those
of other Cardinals who have been men
tioned as likely to succeed the dead
Pontiff, although ' there still exists a
strong feeling that some one hitherto
scarcely talked of may wear the tiara.
Much comment was excited o.t the Vat
ican by- a drive which Cardinal Oreglia
took through/the Vatican gardens this
morning. The Cardinal did not appear
to be satisfied with what he saw. He
shook his head, exclaiming dismally:
What decay! What nesleet. I could not
remain shut up In this melancholy .place. I
should die within a year.
v The gossips now wish to know if this
means that the Cardinal would not ac
cept the Papacy If elected. It seems that
the more probable interpretation of his
remarks would be that if made Pope he
would institute great !" changes In tho
gardens.
The nearer the conclave approaches the
more two distinct tendencies are shown
in the Sacred College, especially, among
the Cardinals of the Curia (that 1h to say
those living in Rome), but in which the
Cardinals from the provinces, as well as
the foreign Cardinals, cannot help par
ticipating. These two tendencies gnrlnn
The antl-Rampolla tendency has more
prominent candidates, such as Cardinals
Oreglla, Vannutelll, Satolli and Agllardl,
which will cause difficulty in arriving at
an agreement upon any one of them. It
is already foreshadowed that should the
success of their opjfcnents be probable
this group will center all their votes upon
Cardinal Capccelatro, Archbishop of Ca
pula.
It Is understood that the Prussian Min
ister accredited to the Vatican has re
ceived instructions to favor the election of
Cardinal Serafino l Vannutelli or Agllardi.
Bishop Kopp. Bishop of Breslau, who ar
rived yesterday, has been approached to
the same effect.
The Congregation of Cardinals haryiot

LINCOLN. Nebr., July 24.â One of the
most daring robberies in the history of

stranger robbed two Lincoln business
houses of $45, using a revolver to terror
ize the victims. He first entered -,the
rooms over the restaurant of O. E. Houck,
where the latter was taking a bath. He
commanded Houck to make no outcry and
rifled his pockets cf $7 50. The thief tlwn
went to Rhelnlanders' drug store and
broke in the rear door, while the clerks
were watching the parade of Ringling's
circus, opened the safe and got $38. A
clerk was standing behind the soda
water fountain at the time, but the rob
bery was not discovered until ten minutes

made to the Supreme Court last Tuesday
and on Wednesday evening the papers
granting- the stay of execution were given
to .the â¢ Wells-Fargo Express Company to
be sent to Warden Aguirre.
. It was ions after the hour scheduled for
the execution when the documents ar
rived :at the prison. Warden Aguirre's as
sertion last night that he would hang
Howard unless the papers were received
before sundown to-day would have been
made good had not the publicity caused

was knocked down by Fletcher.
.Dr. Fletcher and his wife and child ar
rived here last evening and took apart
ments at the Palace lodging house. About
the same time Hosklns reached Petalu
ma, vowing vengeance on the wan who
he alleged had broken up his home in
St. Louis, and wrecked his happiness by
eloping with his wife. Hoskins reached
this city this morning, coming up on the
freight train from Petaluma. He at once
located the object of his wrath, and as
he started up the stairs to interview Dr.
Fletcher he was searched for weapons by
City Marshal George Severson. Hosklns
then changed his mind and w^nt to his
hotel. There he caused a message to be
sent to Fletcher that a person desired to
see him at the Occidental Hotel. Fletcher
replied that he would be over at once, but
before he reached the hostelry Hoskins
had retired and given orders that he was
not to be disturbed until 1 o'clock. Dr.
and Mrs. Fletcher and her child took
breakfast at tlie . Occidental, and then,
strolled around* town.- â¢ '.
Just about .noon the men met on.Fourth
street and Hoskins requested an Inter
view. Fletcher declared that he did not
wish to talk to or have anything to do
with Hosklns, whereupon the latter re
turned to the hotel. Later Fletcher In
formed Hoskins that he could I have a
private interview with Mrs. Fletcher.
With her he walked three blocks on B
street, during which time Mrs. Fletcher
alleges Hosklns denied ever having stated
to any one that he was her husband. Mrs.
Fletcher confronted him with Gallant
Rains, proprietor of the hotel, and Hos
kins again said he had not called the
woman his wife. There were others
present to whom ho had told of a mar
riage to Mrs. Fletcher. He was asked
If he had not claimed the child to be his, 1
and answered that he would not reply to
that question. He was accused of having
said so and at this juncture Dr. Fletcher
took hold of him and shook him and then
struck him twice In the face.
Dr. and Mrs. Fletcher say that they
were married In Quincy. Illinois, nine
years ago, and that they have been on
this coast since December last. They de
clare that they never say Hosklns pre
vious to meeting him socially in San Jose.
They assert that Hosklns conceived a vio
lent infatuation. for Mrs. Fletcher and fol
lowed her to San Leandro, Palo Alto and
San Jose on her return to that city.
Hosklns relates a story of an outraged
husband and previous to being knocked
down by Fletcher rehearsed it to a unm
ber of people in this city. He stated
freely that he was married to the woman
with Fletcher in St. Louis on March 27
1900, and that he is the father of a son
born to her three years ago last May
He also says that he left St. Louis a
week ago last Wednesday to pursue his
wife and child. He states they left' with
Dr. Fletcher three months ago, and ex
plains the loss of time between their de
parture and his beginning of pursuit by
saying he did not wish his relatives and
employers to know of his marital
troubles. In contradiction of this the

The congregation to-day also heard the
secret reports from the Nuncios at Vien

proved the charity bequeathed by Leo to
the poor, dividing it as follows: Ten
thousand dollars for Rome; 54000 for Pe
rugia, where Leo was for many years
Archbishop, and $2000 for Carpineto,
where the late Pontiff was born.
To-night the Italia sees alleged con
firmation of the story that Cardinal Gib
bons had succeeded in transforming Car
dinal Richard, the Archbishop of Paris,
into an opponent of Cardinal Rampolla,
in the alleged fact that Cardinal Gibbons
did not leave Cardinal Richard while In
Paris; that they left together for Rome,
traveled together and will lodge together
at the house of the Order of St. Sulplce.
AÂ» a matter of fact, only the statement
that they will live together is true. It Is
known that they did not start for Rome
together. ' Cardinal Richard is coming via
Modane and Cardinal Gibbons via St.

Pope and Monslgnor SardI the oration
on the duties of tho college. In connec
tion with the selection of Leo's- succes
sor. These appointments, however, are
of a, tentative nature and have not yet

formally asked to pronounce the funeral
oration, but declined owing' to bad
health. For a similar reason Monsignor
fH fieri, the confessor of the late Pope,
declined an' appointment- as confessor of
the conclave.
The report that Monslgnor D. J. O'Con
nell, rector of the Catholic University In
Washington, was obliged to leave Rome
on account of his. electioneering for Car
dinal Gibbons is pronounced absolutely
untrue. Â¦ The fact .is that Monslgnor

yesterday against the trustees of the
First Presbyterian Church to set aside
a deed made by J. C. Beideman in 1S54
conveying: to them property on Eddy
street, near Franklin. She ' claims that
because they failed to erect thereon a
church, as was stipulated by Beideman.
the conveyance should be declared null
and void. A similar suit was filed some
months ago by an heir of Beideman.

This week's News Letter contains- a- very
timely article upon the present relations of la
bor and capital from the pen of Greer Harri
son. It is thoughtfully written and in sure to
create eornewhat of a sensation. The stories
by the Looker On are brighter and more local
than usual, while the natlre of the Town Crier
Is at least a? biting as we usually get from
that ungeninl cynic. Trouble in society is clev
erly depicted in an article on the servant girl
Â¦ unction as it has lately made itself manifest
at Uurlingame, and there are other features
and stories which render this by far the most
readable of the local weeklies. . â¢
There were several lots of this grain
that Herman* Epplnger represented .in
storage In the warehouse mentioned, so
says the indictment, each bÂ«lng of the
weight of 200.000 pounds. Altogether, as
set up,- there was a . total of 1,000.000
pounds. .All this property was described
in a warehouse receipt that was dated
December 11, 1902; and It was represented
by Herman Eppinger that all of such
said personal property and goods was
then actually deposited and stored In the
warehouse of the Pacific Warehouse Com
pany at Crockett.'
The Jury finds that the grain .was not
in the . warehouse, that none of the grain
described in '/the receipt was owned by
Herman Epplnger, Jacob Eppinger or
Bernhard Ettlinger: nor were there any
good or valid receipts forvthe wheat or
for any wheat, whatsoever, in this trans
action. The Bank of Monterey and P. E.
Bowles, so the indictment further sets
forth/were induced by representations of
Herman Eppinger to loan money on the
warehouse receipt of December 11, 1903,
and also on a promissory "note dated May
4, 1903, bearing 5 per cent per annum, for
$11,500. â¢
FACTS OF FRAUD.
No indictment was found by the Grand
Jury against Bernhard Ettlinger, of the'
llrm of Eppinger & Co. Detective Tom
Gibson has discovered evidence relating
to Ettlinger's agency In the affairs of the
concern and this will be brought before
the next Grand Jury. At. the same time
an indictment will be sought against
James Demlngs, who was the superin
tendent of the Pacific Coast Warehouse
Company's warehouses at Crockett at the
time, when the suspension of Epplnger &
Co. took place. Testimony will be pre
sented concerning the taking away of
the warehouse grain books from the
warehouses on the eve of suspension, in
which, it is alleged, Demlngs was'Con
cerned. The Grand Jury that found In
dlctmfnt.^ agralnst Jacob and Herman
Epplnger filed its final report last night
and was discharged.
The allegations in the Indictment that
was returned yesterday against Herman
Epplnger are of the same general purport
as those in the Jacob Eppinger Indict
ment. It is set up that Herman Eppin
ger, on or about May 4, 1903, by fraudu
lent pretenses and representations, did
willfully, unlawfully, knowingly and de
signedly .pretend and represent to the
Bank of Monterey and to one P. E.
Bowles. , who was the I- agent, servant,
employe, etc.. of the bank named, that
Herman Epplnger, Jacob Epplnger and
Bernhard 'Ettlinger, constituting the firm
of Eppinger & Co.,, were the owners of
goods, being grain, then stored in the
warehouses of the Pacific Coast Ware
house Company at Crockett, Cal.
About 5:30 p.* m. the Grand Jury filed
into Judge Murasky's presence with
District Attorney Byington. William J.
Bryan, fofeman of the Grand Jury, after
the usual preliminaries, handed up the
indictment. Henry Ach surrendered Her
man Epplnger to the Sheriff. Epplngrer
had his bondsmen ready, who are Simon
Newman, a grain dealer, and Max Stone
of the I X L. dairy. District Attorney
Byington requested that the bond be
made 112,000. the amount of money men
tioned In the Indictment as having been
procured by false pretenses being $11,500.
In the case of Jacob Eppinger last week
the bond was fixed at $11,000, the amount
mentioned in the indictment being $10,000.
Attorney Ach made no objection and the
bondsmen qualified and Herman Eppinger
left the courtroom In a few minutes with
his bondsmen, attorney and relatives.

A watch was kept upon his movements,
but for a* time he escaped the vigilance of
the detectives. He was finally traced to
this city. Church thinks Hill fled to this
coast to avoid the consequences of some
other crime, committed by him.
Harry, alias Leon, W. Hill, who was ar
rested here about two weeks ago, will be
taken back, this morning to Jollet (111.)
penitentiary by C. E. Church, parole
commissioner for penitentiaries .In Illi
nois, and C. H. Pierson, a deputy warden
at Joliet. They arrived here yesterday
with the papers for Hill's extradition.
Church says that Hill escaped from
Jollet three years ago. He was sentenced
in Chicago to . serve twelve years for
grand larceny, and, being a druggist, he
was placed in the pharmacy at the insti
tution. After his escape he was traced to
Ohio arid arrested, but defeated efforts to

Among the recommendations made was
one that an official shall be appointed to
take charge of the City Cemetery and
protect it from vandalism; and that the
office of the Public Administrator shall
be conducted on a salaried basis, the
Public Administrator being the only city
and copnty officer now depending upon
fees.
The order of the Board of Health under
which there was a wholesale removal of
plumbing from buildings was declared to
have worked hardship.
It was recommended that the number of
fire hydrants in the city be increased to
."â¢"00 and that large water mains shall sup
plant email ones; that the police force
shall be brought up to the full numerical
limit provided for under the charter.
The Jury found that by sending 2270 un
used desks to furnish outside schools
310,000 can be saved in furnishing and ob
viate the necessity of purchasing , such
supplies for two years. More accommo
dations were declared^to be necessary in
the outlying districts 'and new buildings
should be provided there. In the Rich
mond and Sunset districts lots owned by
the city and county and held for the ben
efit of the Fire Deparatment, It was de
clared,- could be used, thus effecting a
considerable saving to the School Depart
ment.
All the city and county departments not
mentioned in the foregoing as having
been censured met with compliments at
the hands of the Grand Jury. Several
recommendations were Included In the re
port. It was advised that the present site
for the County Hospital should be re
tained and the statement "was made that
the expenditure of J100.000 would put the
existing buildings into such shape that
the city would have a fine hospital, ade
quate for its needs for some years to
come. jJttSSl
Praise was given to the Fire and Police
departments, and Chief Sullivan of the
Fire Department was complimented very
highly. The Jury suggested keeping a
close watch on the spoilsmen who are
after the Fire Department. The following
iÂ» from the report on that point:
In closing our report on this most Important
department of this city we are shaken with a
fear that the heretofore excellent manage
ment is about to be invaded by the resurrec
tion of the old spoils system from which so
many scandals were always In evidence, and
we think a watchful eve on the doings of this
department would not be amis?. The whole
people should be awake to any Innovation in
the Fire Department that would lessen its
present efficiency, and frown down any at
tempt to change methods that have proved so
satisfactory to the people of this city.
SOME WORDS OF PRAISE.
The Board of Public Works was de
clared by the jury to be "somewhat cum
bersome in Its ramifications and slow in
obtaining results that may have been
earlier looked for in the rearrangement of
this department."
In the attention giv*n to streets and' thor
oughfares the people have. just cause for com
plaint. The Item of street cleaning severely
appeals to the criticism of the public, who
witness the slovenly manner of sweating the
streets and removing rubbish. The large ap
propriation for this purpose is of ample di
mensions, calling for better service. a.nd we
think closer attention to this Important subject'
is demanded. Repair* to accepted ' streets are
also noted as deserving feevere censure: the
distribution of the large appropriation allotted
to the Hoar.! of Public Works is sufficiently
liberal in all direction* except the most - lm
portant one of repairs to accepted streets; the
shameful condition of many, of the roadways
paved with bitumen attests the insufficient sum
set apart for this purpoie; and we are of the'
opinion that so much of the budget as has
been apportioned for the use of the Board of.
Public Works should have been segregated in
such a manner that the Item of repairs to
public streets may not fall below the sum of
at least $100,000 annually.
Anticipating a large Inflow of funds into the
treasury by Â«n affirmative vote of the peopl*
on the several bond issues, elaborate prepar
ations in the shape of plans and estimates of
cost of the numerous buildings and projects as
designed show an Intention to disburse moneys
on a most magnificent scale, the actual necr-s
sltv for which does not at this time appear.
We think that the Board of Public Works
should be granted more time to perfect Its or
ganization, that its disbursements may show
better results for the money appropriated for
the department.
BOARD OF WORKS.
cause for objecting to this unbounded generosity
with the money of the people. There is a feel-
Ing of disappointment that so little of better
ments Is provided for in a budget of such
enormous proportions, and there is also a feel
ing of indignation that the main thoroughfares
of this boasted metropolis of the West should
be allowed to become a menace to the traffic
for which they were laid out and provided. An
nually the treasury of this city receives a sum
equal to the purchase price of the enormous
domain of Alaska: more than 17,000,000 yearly
is collected from the people, and as a return
they can gaze on streets badly swept and cut
up Into ruts, thereby endangering life and limb,
and this. too. while the funds are so bountifully
distributed to the extent of $4.0*0.000 In the
shape of salaries. And this Jury Joins with the.
general public in a protest and disapproval of
such an unfair distribution of the public funds.
The Beard of Supervisors was not for
rotten and the Grand Jury made the fol
lowing report concerning that body:
In legislating fcr the public benefit the tax
payer does not always appear to be in eight
before this honorable body. The free and very
literal appropriation for salaries rails aloud in
protest, and this Jury is of the opinion that the
honorable gentlemen i-hould give a more re
spr-ctful consideration to the pockets of thotÂ»
who furn'.sh the fundt, and we agree with the
general objection to a budget whose component
part is two-thirds salaries. W> think that the
l>rcr>ortlon of wages to the whole appropriation
is so far at variance with strict business econ
omy (and especially so because of the bad con
dition of the strf-eti) that the taxpayer has Just
BOARD* OF SUPERVISORS.
Considerable friction has been engendered
between itself and other branches of the city
irovernmer.t to the subversion of discipline, and
this Jury :.- of the opinion that such controver
sies are ill advised, sometimes causing teach
ers to take sides and creating prejudices that
are net a part cf the studies of the public
schools. Tnere is large room for Improvement
In the management of the schools, and It could
be applied Â»lth profit to the scholars. There
has been much complaint because of the crowd
ed condition of some of the class rooms, and it
has b*^>n said tlict many pupils were compelled
to wait for a vacancy to aris*- before they could
b? seated, and thon the sudden acclaim goes
up for more schoolhouses. which seems to be
not in accord wi;h the actual condition then
existing, showing i2T3 more desks than there
were purlls to occupy them.
The Board of Education was reported
not to have covered the School Depart
ment with glory:
BOARD OF EDUCATION.
The above covers thÂ» charges laid before, this
lury, and the result of Its Investigation, which,
is Â»Â«lore etatpd. did not violate ur.y uw u;>-n
Â« *-.lch we could take action, dr.: we therefore

Mans* objectionable features in the conduct
end management of that office wera apparent,
and trie whole atmosphere seemed to be load
ed with politics. A thorough and complete re
nrraR/tsment of the department, based on busi
ness methods, would yield a more eatlsfactory
ccnditlon. The charge that clerks were as
sessed to defend suits and help In election cam
paigns Is not denied, and shelter is taken un
der the statement that all such contributions
are voluntary- and have been the habit from
the time beyond the oldest Inhabitant. This
Jury iÂ» of the opinion that the custom Is rep
rehensible and rhould be punished; yet we
are powerlf-ss In the premises, as we do not
find any Jaw under which we can act, and
must be content with the recommendation that
this department be taken out of politic* i.nd
Its employee placed under civil service rules.
References and charges were a!eiÂ» brought be

subject, and again we find a system that is not

is great. It has been and now Is the custom
to settle accounts of moneys received from
suits with the proper officer once every month,
during which period the fund is growing, and is
kept in the custody of the County Clerk until
prohably the last day. when, according to law.
It must be paid over to an officer authorized
by law to receive the same. In these days of
fast living and good fellowship the prÂ«-Eence of
funds Jn the drawer from which it is so rasuy
drav.n and a tag substituted is very aijt to
:^mjit the custodian of such moneys, and this
lury urges a change of method? in rtgarl- to
:he payment of this fund into the proper chan
ael.
BOASTS COUNTY CLERK.
After the prereding, attention was paid
to the County Clerks office in the follow
ing terms:
Re*;ardln* the Civil Service Commission we
%t* bound to i>ay that much can and should be
'roprovfd in the manner the examinationi) aro
held, and likewise deplore the fact that the
Â»Â»-vfral papers of examination are so willfully
Wiroyed. for certainly do we consider the
4&me public records, arifl as cuch. they should
se kept Intact for at least one year after the
â¢xaniinatlon was held.
Th*>re was vitriol mixed in with the
words of praise thai the Grand Jury filed
last evening relative to the departments
of the city and county government. A
"roast" was administered to Mayor
Bchmitz and also to the Civil Service
Commission as follows:
Hia Honor, the Mayor, we find attending to
!.> official duties, but we cannot refrain from
remarking; that he wae rather unfortunate In
the selection of come Commissioners appointed
ty him. and we would recommend that before
a Oomrals-slcner is named by hlÂ« Honor
he t&ke pains to scrutinize the general reputa
tion of the respective party and not be aruided
In his appointments to reward political frtend

Quire* that the important and responsible po
sttlon of Commissioner in every department
rhould be f.lled by men who are above eue

The trial of Michael Nolan, another of
the gang of thugs, will commence on
luonday morning, and, as he has no
money to employ an attorney, the Judge
has appointed Attorneys McClellan and
.McCloskey to defend him. It is ex
pected that John Davis, the other thug,
will plead guilty. Docla Nolan, the in
stigator of the plot, is now under sen
tence of eight years, but it is anticipated
that a much more severe sentence will be
imposed upon Whltelaw, who was the
leader of the gang.
He has no local record, but the police
say he was arrested in St. Louis for
shooting and killing a man, but was ac
quitted. 'â¢â¢- ;. . ;<.

afternoon of March 4 and robbed her of

jury, which; retired at 10:20 o'clock to con
sider the verdict. In less than five-min
uses the bell. In the jury-room was rung
and '; Bailiff Ryan was informed that an
agreement had been reached. After the
Jurors had taken their seats in the box

ant guilty as charged.

thing, a shade paler, but beyond that he
seemed as cool as ever. His attorney, W.
S..'Barnep,' asked, that sentence be post
poned for two weeks to give him time
to make a motion for a new trial, but
the Judge said the defendant would be
sentenced on Saturday, August 1. As
Whltelaw was being taken to the City
Prison he remarked: "Why, this is only

plenty of coin forthcoming from his
father In St. Louis, with which to take

.For weeks past artisans have been in
dustriously plying their trades in the
premises. of. the Bay State Cafe, conduct
ed by Max Adler, at 29 Stockton street,
with such effect that this., familiar and
popular restaurant has taken on a fresh
ness and brilliancy that could. hardly be
excelled if entirely new. Those who know
a good^French dinner, and there are many
in town who-, do, will readily recall when
Mr. , Adler .first opened the Bay State
Cafe ten years ago and the Instantaneous
success that he met with in establishing
the best medium priced dinner In San
Francisco. .-â¢: His success was noteworthy
from the start because he knew what the
public wanted and furnished it at a price
that was always reasonable for the ser
vice rendered. â¢ v
To keep pace with his constantly grow
ing patronage enlargement and Improve
ment* have been necessary and so- to-day
the Bay State Cafe makes its reappear
ance-remodeled and rehabilitated. No ex
pense has been spared in the decorations
of the place. The furniture, rugs,
carpets, * draperies and .fixtures are
all of -the, latest pattern and the
most famous makes. Probably the
most' impressive feature - of the recent
improvements; because most conspic
uous, is the large and comfortable dining
room, where .an elaborate scheme of dec
oration was planned and, effectively car
ried out, resulting in one of the most at
tractive-dining-rooms of the West.
To-day Mr. Adler will entertain in honor
of the active resumption of business and
to that end' has secured an orchestra,
whose - leader, ; Pietro Marino, is favorably
known as a musician of recognized abil
ity. A. -choice list of musical selections
will gratify the senses. Artistic decora
tions will charm the eye and dellciously
served= viands so effectively appeal to the
appetite that to-day should be memorable
in the annals of . the Bay State - Cafe.
Aside from the high character of substan
tial . foods . that will laden the tables of
Mr. Adler he announces. a list of vintages
and b;ers that are famous and reasonably
low priced. All the domestic and Import
ed beers, -as Culmbacher, Wurzburger,
Pilsener, ...will be constantly on draught,
while the Cresta Blanca white wines and
the Asti Wine Company's red. wines are
too well known to connoisseurs to require
other indorsement. .
Mr. when he founded the Bay
State Cafe, determined that his cuisine
should be ; of the highest order and that
it has '.been well sustained is evidenced
by his greatly increased patronage. His
family trade is enormous, while the large
theatrical patronage, always 'critical of
cooking, and service, bears mute evidence
of his ability to please 'the most exacting.

The board also submits a table showing
that the total cost' of- the -bond Â¦issues* in
cluding interest. for 40 years at 3Vfc'per

with a full knowledge of the facts.
The ag^r^trate of costs for children's play
grounds Is ?741,OOO. These ;areas can be. ac
quired at no time In the future any cheaper
than at present, and the necessity for healthy,
open air exercise Is such as to warrant the im-\
mediate expenditure of. the sum above named.
The library and site are estimated to cost
$1,647,000. of which sum an offer is yet avail
able for S75O.0O0 for the building. This mat
ter has been so fully discussed that voters are
fully advlFed regarding its merits and de
merits. This board expresses a preference . to
seeing the public and law libraries housed at
less cost. in a fourth story and under a new
roof to the City Hall. â¢
Additional park areas, aggregating five In
number, call for an expenditure of $1,684,000.
It has been considered best to submit to 'the"
people the proposition of acquiring the. lots to

The additions called for in the list submitted
aggregate twenty-seven new buildi-igs and i-x
tensive additions to three existing buildings.
These have an aggregate capacity of over 300
â¢classrooms, with a seating capacity of over
18,000 pupils. About one-half of these new
buildings replace existing ones, some of which,
like the Lowell and Polytechnic high schools,
will become available for schools of lower
grade. In seventeen schools which .are pro
posed to be rebuilt, or 'added to, the number
of rooms Is raised from 112 to 23K. and the
seating capacity Is raised from about 6200 to
about 11,800. This Is of course Included in the
figures â¢ previously given.

expenditure of f 1.000,000. . The plans have
been made to fit a site on the westerly slopes
of the Almshouse tract, set apart on June 27'

site necessitate placing the main gallery upon

gallery the wards and other-bunding* connect
The site Is not so advantageous as others now
owned by the city: much as. better hospital
facilities are needed, there â¢ may be . doubts as
to the wisdom, of expending, ao large a sum

NEW SCHOOL BUILDINGS.
The proposition to establish children's play
grounds haB received some attention during the
last few years. The city at present maintains
one on leased land at the northeasterly corner
of Seventh and Harrison streets. Should bonds
be voted for the purpose two will be estab
lishedâone in the northern section of the
city, the entire block of land Just north of
Washington Square, and one south of Market
i street, easterly from Seventh to Harriet street,
between Harrison and Bryant streets. The lo
i cation of these playgrounds,' In both Instances
! close by a public park, the one south of Mar
ket street being separated only by Harrison
street from Columbia Park, will add to the
popularity of parks as well as playgrounds.
The proposed extension of Golden Gate Park
northerly to the Presidio is to be effected by a
purchase of the several blocks of land lying
between Thirteenth and Fourteenth avenues.
The Park and the Presidio would be connected.
If this purchase be made, by a broad parked'
way, with a street upon each sfdÂ». having a
total length of almost one mile. Not Including
the surface of the streets crossed by the ex
tension It would add nearly , twenty-four acres
to the park area. . ' Â¦
The park in the Mission will be directly in
front of the Mission High School. . It will em->
brace the two blocks of land which extend
southerly from Eighteenth street to Twentieth,
between Dolores, and Church. â¢Â¦ . . â¢ i
The establishment of ft Twin Peaks ' Park
will Insure the preservation of the Twin Peaks,,
which form such a beautiful limit to the In
land view along Market street, and which, by
reason of their altitude, slightly In excess of
9<X> feet, and their commanding position In al-
I most the exact geographical center of tho
'city, command a view that -deserves to be
world famed. A park 4n this location as pro
posed, with an area, of 161 acres, would, when
Â¦ well Improved, be sure to prove a popular
! pleasure ground.
The preservation of Telegraph Hill without
detriment to the business and commercial In
terests of the North Beach section will result
from the establishment of a Telegraph Hill
Park, as now proposed. The lands to be ac
1 quired are contiguous to Pioneer Park," which
Is a small park on the hill summit, donated to
the city some years ago by a number of pub
lic spirited citizens. - â¢ â¢Â¦
By acquiring ownership of the lands along
and including the steep eastern and northern
! declivity of the hill the city will be in a posi
tion to control its ultimate shape. A limit
will be set to the hillside excavations. The
rugged slopes can be beautified by the planting
of trees and vines. The hWtop itself will ul
timately be made accessible by a winding
driveway and by a number of stairways. The
proposed bond issue Is for the purchase of the
necessary land. , â¢
The acquisition of land for a public park
between California and Bush streets, easterly
from Dupont street, has long been under con
sideration, and if established will be known as
St. Mary's Square.
The Board of Public Works transmitted
a letter to the Board of Supervisors in
which certain suggestions are made with
the hope that they may serve 'to direct
the thought and Judgment of voters to a
full consideration of them, and not only
to segregate the essential from the non
essential, but also to consider whether
the best 'possiDle sites have been selected,
and whether over-generous measures have
been made of some of, the actual necessi
ties. The letter savs further: . ' .
â¢ In 1000, at the beginning of the studies, di
rected by the charter, as to the acquisition of
public necessities and utilities, the water sup-,
ply very properly occupied the first place, and
received the most attention and study. The
results of these studies have not yet been laid
before the citizens In full published form, so
that they are in a large measure In ignorance
of the very carefully worked out plans for
meeting this most pressing necessity of the
city. This vital matter has In some way been
allowed to fall in the rear, and does not ap
pear at all in the . list of projects to be sub
mitted to the voters. Water supply so far out
ranks all other matters, both In importance
and cost, that they could well be allowed to
rest until the water question had been settled.
The sewer system ranks next In Importance.
Its conditions and necessities have been fully
set before the public, so that voters may well
judge of their action In this matter.
New and more modern schoolhouses are un
questionably needed. Since the new charter
went Into effect, very great additions and im
provements have been made, and accommoda
tions have been added tnj the extent of over
â¢3000 seats, and a new fAirteen-room' school
house is In process of erection in Noe Valley.

Young married women must remem-
bier that tHe experience of 'maternity should!
not I be approached without careful physical j
preparation. _ *l
r AV capable ; mother must be a healthy mother j the birth of tha !
first child is an especially trying experience, and nature needs all tho
help it' can. get." - Correct and practical counsel is of the most vital fan- i
portahce *-to the would-be mother. Mrs. Pinkham's advice at such
tunes; together with Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com pound* have
guided many a young woman" through this trying experience "with the
Happiest possible results. Her. advice is that of a mother with an ex-
perience with thousands of such cases, and given entirely free. i
I Byl special permission we publish the following three letters, show-
ing the absolute necessity of proper care and advice at the time of
maternity. That of Mrs. Sexton illustrates t^e dangers of maternity.
That of Mrs. Hanson the suffering during the period; and that, of Mrs.
Massey the troubles that may beset a young mother after child-birth;
and they: all illustrate the wonderful value of Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound in such cases. - >
'>flrs. Lilie Sexton, Ashland, Ky., Boyd Co., says.^l
" Dbab Mrs. Phtkham : â I wrote toyou'in Sept., 1900. I had been married
two years and had two miscarriages, one at six months and one at seren. My
organs were very weak. You advised me to use Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable .Compound, and I began at once and used 13 bottles.
"In June; 1901, 1 again expected to become a mother, and now I have a fine
baby girl, two months 1 old. I took the Compound all the time during preg-
nancy. I cannot praise your remedies enough." - % .
Mrs. Karianna Hanson, Box 343, Worthlngton, Minn., says: \
"Dear Mbs. Pixkham : â I feel it my duty to send you my sincere thanks
for your kind advice and for the good Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound and your letter of advice have done me.
1 " When I wrote you I did not see a well day. I was to become a mother,
and had headache, dizziness, poor appetite, was nervous, had pains and
cramps in abdomen and swollen feet. .
t " After following your advice I soon began to feel better. . When I had
taken four bottles' of Lydia E. P ink ham's vegre table Compound I felt
real well. My baby when three months' old weighed over twenty pounds.
- " I- cannot; praise your wonderful medicine enough, and would advise all
suffering . .joicn to write to you and use Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound." j
firs, n.n.riassey, Sulphur Springs, Texas, says: *
; ." Deab Mks. Pijtxham : â I^will tell you what I think about Lydia E.
Pinkham's -Vegetable Compound. I think it is a wonderful medicine.
I believe it saved my life.. Â¦ >
" When one of my children was just five weeks old I took a set-back and
came near dying. I was in bed two weeks. The doctor attended me about
a week and I got no better. My bowels would nearly kill me at times, only
easy '.when under tho influence of opiates. It seemed at times there were
knots. in my bowels as large as my fist. I had such pain in my left side.-' I
suffered as much as I did when my baby -was* born.
"I got a bottle of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound one
evening, and by tho next day I was nearly easy. I will always praise your
medicine." Â¦ -*,..,'

Surely such endorsement should dispel doubt from the minds
of all hesitating: women. After reading- such letters* if any woman
is willing to remain sick, we can only say it is her own fault and
she deserves to suffer; for the medicine that has benefited these
women and a hundred thousand others will surely help you.

MR. WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST,
Â¦member from the tenderloin and candidate
for the Presidency; has, not favored his
anxious and waiting country with an original opin
ion since he made department stores a Democratic
principle. and bravely and frankly indorsed them in a
letter to the. Missouri Democracy. The wild enthusi
asm which swept 'over the party like colic through the
transverse 7 colon of a boy who eats the too too green
apple should have encquraged Mr. William Randolph
Hearst to! open his alabaster box-and squeeze out a
few more drops of the, precious ointment, of his
wisdom, instead of which he- hied honeymooning to
Europe." - . â¢Â¦- â¢ *.â¢ â¢-.Â¦ .-Â¦â¢.Â¦â¢.
Looking back upon his beloved country in per
spective he saw something going on which imme
diately alarmed him. The President proposes an
extra session of Congress to. deal, among other
things,- with' the problem of.emergency currency and
its, distribution 1 so that business men can economi
cally use their credit remote from the financial cen
ters. The keen of Mr/ Wiliiam Randolph'Hearst
immediately detected a plot. One/of the currency
bills before Congress were introduced .by Senator Al
drich, whose daughter is the wife of -John D. Rocke
feller's son, therefore John D. Rockefeller has spoken
to his daughter-in-law/to ask her father to increase
the currency : of the country in T order that there may
be more money for her father-injlaw to put in his
pocket!. It is an inspiration! What /Other eye ; could
have seen this plot, what other nose smelled it, what
other ear heard it! â¢'
. It will be observed that in revealing it Mr. William
Randolph Hearst has pointed plainly the way to the
undoing of Rockefeller. ' Instead of giving that per
nicious person more money to put in his pocket
knock him out by abolishing money entirely! - When
that is done the currency which -Mr. William Ran
dolph Hearst sees bulging out his pockets .will, be of
no value and John- D. Rockefeller will have to hit the
pike and live-on handouts. â¢
This is genius. We have now two planks > made by
Mr. William 1 Randolph Hearst, like the man made his
pig trough, out of his own lieVd. They are : v y.
: Resolved, 'That' department* stores are a, cherished
Jeffersonian Democratic-principle.; . ,". 'Â¦'-.'Â¦*'Â£',"Â¦' /Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦

A CANDIDATE ON CURRENCY.
â¢The collapse of the machine on the very eve ot
what was expected to be a demonstration of its value
is but one more in the long list of failures on ,the
part of the experimenters with flying machines, and
it can hardly be said that it was looked upon by the
public as a disappointment. In fact, outside a limited
circle" of. scientists, there is no very sanguine hope
of the speedy attainment of aerial navigation by
means of a machine heavier than the air and driven
in its flight by an engine' which it carries with it.
For a long time there has been a more or less*
heated controversy between the advocates of dirigible
balloons and the supporters of the theory that the
navigation oPthe air can be effected only by a flying
machine. In the argument the' scientists \ have had
the best of it. Men of eminence like Professor Lang
ley, Professor Bell and Sir Hiram Maxim have given
strong reasons for believing that the dirigible balloon
can never be much more than a toy, while the flying
machine may be eventually made capable, of carrying
a considerable weight through the air and of holding
to its course against a heavy wind. Meantime the
dirigible balloon men, though beaten in argument,
have had a large measure of -success in the "field of
experiment. Santos Dumont, Lebaudy and others
have actually directed their balloons'through" the air,
have made considerable trips and returned in safety
to. the place, of starting. Therr balloons may not be
of much use for commercial purposes, but they have
certainly served to show that a balloon can be guided
in a* definite course through the air. and is not com
pletely subject to the course of an ordinary wind.
Recent reports from Paris are to the effect that
the sailing of dirigible balloons around the city has
become. so common that the police authorities have
found it* necessary to establish regulations for the
use Of balloons just as for the use of automobiles.
It is announced Â¦ furthermore that pleasure^ trips in
balloons is becoming one of the fads of the day, and
a company has been. organized to establish a line of
balloons for trips over and around the' city." Santos
Dumont has declared a conviction that it is now pos
sible to construct a dirigible . balloon capable- of
crossing the Atlantic and carrying passengers. He
insist? that if a balloon as big as one of the great
Atlantic liners were constructed it would prove suc
cessful and would soon command all first-class pas-^
sengcr traffic, leaving to the water boats only freight
business and steerage travel. . ,
The general public will leave the controversy as to
the comparative; merits of the two methods oÂ£ seek
ing aerial -navigation tothp experts: on either side.
Judgment will be pronounced not upon- argument,
but upon i ..the, results of experiment. At present/the'
scientists-have shown by clear; reasoning^ that ;'a diri
gible balloon cannot equal ah aeroplane or an"aero
drome, but in tht field of actual achievement they have ;
DAMAGE done to Professor Langlejvs aero
drome by the stprm that overtook it oh its
wa}' down. the Potomac to the grounds where
it was to be tested must have been much more serious
than was reported, for the test seems to have been
postponed indefinitely. Of late nothing has been
heard of the machine nor from the inventor, and it is
fair to conclude that some part of the machinery has
gone wrong and much time will be required in. re
pairing it or replacing it.

RUMORS of war arc so common and have been
rife so long in this peaceful world of ours .that
but little heed is given when a new one rises
and runs its course. Consequently the strained rela
tions between Russia and Japan and the often re
peated announcements that they are going. to fight
has had little effect upon the public mind. It has
been believed that in these days when the concert of
Europe is so powerful and the influence of the United
States is so strong a war between two powers of im
portance is well" nigh impossible. Nevertheless it
appears that we may have before the year is over
another proof that it is always the unexpected that
happens. Russia is pouring troops into Manchuria,
Japan is arming, and the situation is so serious that
Secretary Hay is reported to have deemed it fcdvisable
for him to intervene and make an effort to avert war.
If the war come it will find neither country pre
pared for it and neither government desirous of it.
Both Japan and Russia are troubled by a lack of
money. A costly war would bÂ» a heavy disaster to
the victor as well as to the vanquished, and wars in
these day< of heavy armaments are of necessity costly.
The British found that out in their war with the
Boers, and the financiers of the world have taken due
note of the facL Still it has been said by Burke that
history affords no instance of a high spirited people
delaying war on account of a lack of money, nor of
one being beaten because of such a lack./ When men
get ready to fight they will fight, money or no money,
and it looks as if the Japanese and the Russians were"
rapidly getting into that frame of mind.
The people of Japan are convinced that their wel
fare depends upon keeping the Russians out of Korea
at all hazards and out of Manchuria if possible. They
do not relish the establishment of a great military
power on the coast opposite to their islands any more
than we- would relish the upbuilding of a strong Euro
pean military power, in Mexico. . Furthermore they
are convinced that if the fight is to come it will be
well for Japan to force it at once, as she is now about
as strong as she can hope to be, while Russia will
gain in strength as the years pass.
Japanese jealousy of Russia, however! is not greater
than Russian jealousy of Japan. A Russian news
paper published in Siberia and supposed to represent
the opinion of the Government recently said: "Why
is not this hysterical demand for Russian, evacuation
of Manchuria accompanied by an equally peremptory
protest against the continued presence of Japanese
troops jn Korea? In SeouJ the Korean Government
is overawed and Koreans are oppressed by Japanese
soldiery. This fact is perfectly well known in London
and Washington. % We are asked to evacuate Inkan
forthwith. Russia will listen to the request when the
Japanese withdraw from Chemulpo, Mosampo and
Zinanpo."
Forty years ago a quarrel of this kind between two
such nations as Japan and -Russia would have been
regarded by the civilized world with indifference, or
at least with nothing more than the interest which
mankind always feels in a fight of any kind whether
between two nstions or a bull and a bear. That
time has passed. The ties of commerce and of finan
cial interest have become cosmopolitan. London,
Paris, Berlin and Xew York would be affected by a
war in Manchuria or Korea almost as much as St.
Petersburg or Yokohama. Furthermore there are
political and military alliances reaching out from the
Orient to Western Europe that have to be taken into
account. Under certain conditions France might be
called upon to send her fleets to the assistance of
Russia, and should that happen Great'Britain would
be bound to help Japan. The war once begun might
therefore spread and become a very great war indeed.
Hence Europe no longer watches those far off quar
rels with indifference. Nor does the United States.
Hence the promptness of Secretary Hay to offer his
services in the interest of peace. '

The statement of Dr. \\*ley was of course intended
only as*a heat' reply to German criticism on the
new law^and is not, to be understood as a serious de
scription of it's nature; ', It was not Resigned as 'Â¦ a

is neither a law, of-; '/measure for. measure" nor ;of

It appears, however, that the Germans have been
j more extensively engaged than any other people in
j the export to this country of deleterious or falsely
i'labeled goods. They have sent to us large quantities
, of. stuff that the producers or manufacturers arc not
I permitted to sell in German markets. -The trade of
r that kind has been very, large. A. Washington re
' port says that under the new "law "German sausage,
sparkling and still wines, salt, beverages, beer and
other 'food products will be rejected, and ff not taken
back to the port from which the cargoes were shipped
j they will be.destroyed.rTow seriously, this will affect
i German trade relations with us may be. gathered from
! the, fact that imports of sparkling and still wines from
that country amount annually to more than $1,300,
000: imports of hops to more' than $600,000; of
malted liquors- to nearly $200,000; of sausages to
nearly $200,000; of sausage casings to $190,000,- while
various other imports of foodstuffs from Germany,
aggregating several millions annually, will be severely
To put a stop to that kind of traffic will not do
the legitimate industries of Germany any harm. Still
if some of them should suffer a little Germany would
have'no right to complain. It is well known that
American fruits and meats have been shut ; out of
German markets -time and again most unjustly un
der the pretense that, they were, deleterious. We do
not intend to put' any* such injustice' upon them, but
if we did, as Dr. Wiley says, it would be no more'
than a case of "sausage for sausage."
D-R. WILEY, of the* chemical bureau of the
\ Department , of Agriculture, having 'Â¦:: been
, askedwhat, if any, right Germany has to pro
test-against the ..pure "food enacted at the late
session. of^Congress, replied that she has
none, and that so} far as} the two countries are ' con
cerned-fhe-3a\v. is simply a case, of ''measure for
measure,"* or "-''sausage for sausage. "- The Germans
have for. a long time excluded frbm > their- markets
several kinds^ of i American food products .-on the
groundthat they were :adulteratcd| x or were preserved
by the use of dangerous/chemicals, and now we are
about to apply 'a treatment to German

According to the statements filed by the
company with Wolf, its total income for
1902 amounted to $9,660,473 49. Its total dis
bursements for the year were $5,054,337 58.
leaving a balance of $4,603.933 91.
The statement shows that after all lia
bilities are accounted for the company ha s
a gross surplus of $513,020 VI.
The late General Clunie was the general ad
viser of the company and he finally became
tired of the dilatory methods of Wolf. ThlÂ»
company has always been willing and Is st.U
prepared to furnish Wolf with all Informa
tion he destres, but we cannot get a. definite
statement from him as to what ha objects to
and our enly resource Is to go Into the courts.
We have not been refused a license in\ any
other State In which we have applied for a
license to do business and we cannot under
stand why Wolf should refuse to let ua do
business In California.
GEN. CLT7NIE WAS ADVISES.
I am not satisfied with the statement of thÂ»
company and until I am I cannot issue tha
license. I presume that the law allows me to
use my discretion In the matter, but I am
prepared to make my reasons known when
this matter comes into court.
C, M. Oakley. State manager for the In
surance company, said: '
" "We applied to Insurance Commissioner Wolf
last October for a license to do business la
California. For many years we operated a* aa
assessment company, but when we reorganized
aa a level premium compan> we desired to get
a license on that basis. We flied our applica
tion with Wolf and also a. copy of our financial
statement. This statement had been passed
upon by Francis Hendrlcks. superintendent of
Insurance of N>w York. The statement showed
that this company was perfectly solvent. Wolf
was not satisfied with certain of thÂ« entries
and he asked us for more information. WÂ»
furnished this to him. but he put us oft agala
and still claimed that he wai not satisfied
with our statement.
When Wolf was asked to give hid spe
cific reasons for declining to Issue a li
cense he replied that he did not care to
make them public at this time. He said:
The Mutual Reserve Company applied to ma
last October tor a license to do business In
California. It flled a statement of its business
wtth me. but 1 wu not satisfied with certain
entries. I aaked for an explanation, but -the
one given me was still unsatisfactory. I havÂ»
not refused to grant a license to thÂ« company.
but feel that I cannot do so ufltli certain things
are explained to me. ,
WOLF IS l/0T SATISFIED.
The writ of mandate was issued by Pre
siding Judge Murasky and made return

of August 10 at 10 o'clock.
In the complaint flied yesterday th? in

AH of this keen. and able effort to injure. the Presi
dent is to be taken as the highest testimony to his
ability, courage and fidelity. He finds law,s which
enforced limit the power of the trusts for /harm
while leaving it unimpaired to do what they may be
capable .of doing. He has enforced the law, hence
this cunning attack upon him. which will not deceive
many people nor affect the result. â¢
Harpers' Weekly' advises that Mr. Bryan be treated
gently and politely. The party must win, it.Says.by
repudiation of his politics, but by' retaining his alle
giance and support. Therefore the' buffets'of politi
cal fortune which beat upon him must be softened by
praise of his great abilities and> flattery soÂ»thing .to
his vanity. Every departure of the party from Bryan
ism is. hailed with gladness. The.- Iowa* convention
was quite smothered in. bouquets, and the hand of
the trust was never more plainly shown than in. the
apologv for the anti-trust plank in its platform. - It
was explained that the' Imakers of that plank were
aware of the impossibility of making it work in prac
tice, therefore it was adopted to soothe public senti
ment ?nd is to be considered as merely for decorative
purposes. . .
But these journals, daily, weekly and monthly, do
not, rely solely ;1p^n a negative position to reduce
the influence of lhc President. They, both push and
pull. The friendliest hand held out io the Democrats
is theirs. No opportunity is lost to commend the
conservative past of the .Democratic party and to
urge that it seek success by a conservative 'future.
Mr. Cleveland is constantly commended as the ideal
pf conservatism, and it is. repeatedly shown that he
or a candidate whom he will actively support .has Â«a
chance to carry the pivotal States of New Jersey,
Xew York. Connecticut and Indiana.
T> HE Harper publications, like the New York
Â¦Sun and,_scveral other popular -daily,' Weekly
and monthly journals in the East, belong to
Mr. ]. P. Morgan and other -gentlemen- who are
vitally -interested in the great capitalizations called
trusts. A study of the political' columns of those
'publications is of interest because it reveals the high
order of talent which their owners can command "and
the use of that talent, in the most-subtle manner,, to
undermine' President Roosevelt...
Â¦ ; When the court decided the railroad merger ad
versely to Mr. HjH the Sun treated it editorially in a
?,tyle that showed riot,'only talent but genius and was
aimed at the political! vitals of the President with a'
deadly intent. Since then the method of attack has
undergone a change, apparently with* a view of con
sulting public opinion and deflecting it by going with
it. instead,, of trying to head it off and turn it aside.
What fhe President /does is indorsed, but immediately
following, ..the indorsement it is pointed out how ; the
same thing might have been better done, or that the
suggestion of the method was derived from precedent
if the action were excellent.
The studied effort to minimize the personality of
the President, tc impugn his motives, and when credit
cannot" be withheld froni an act to represent it as
copied from some one else, is very apparent, and yet
'it is all ably done arid so subtly that theireader who
constantly absorbs it and is not on guard against it
is finally infected by its spirit and is "worked" just
as the promoters of this style of attack intend he
shall be. â¢ JW \ .*'Â¦',:

Why Not See the Stars?
A visit *to the Lick Observatory at Â¦ Mt.
Hamilton is one of the trips that all Cal
ifornlnns should make. The big tele
scope is open to the public every Satur
day night. The trip to San Jose, stopping
at Hotel Vendome, the headquarters for
Lick Observatory, a delightful stage ride
to the summit of Mt. Hamilton and re
turn by moonlightâ here is an experience
long to be remembered. It is getting to
be the popular thing to organize parties
for the "see the stars" outing. .
Disputes Are Settled.
The Supreme Court issued an order
yesterday compelling J. B. Doyle, Auditor
of Tuolumne County, to recognize G. L.
Adams as Sheriff. The petitioner did not
qualify at the proper time and was ap
pointed Sheriff of the county subsequently
by the Board of Supervisors. Doyle held
that the action was not legal. The court
also declared that the will of Henrietta
S. Calef was valid. Mabel C. Cootey con
tended that the testator was not sane at
the time a portio/i of the will was written.

of Hulls and Boilers has been called to the
morning races in which thÂ» capttatns of the

"vThat opened t:p like a rattling good
HamÂ© of ball turned out to be an. awful
delusion after the first round yesterday
afternoon at Kccreation park. Tommy
Leahy Â¦wrenched his shoulder in tho first
inhtey in a vain attempt to slide back
to the safety cf tie first bag. This neces
sitated a chajipe all along the line of
the Karris defense. The Angrels simply
Trent through the line and battered It to
pieces to the music of 14 to 6.
The Angels opened the contest by bat
ting out a pair cf tallies. Then the home
team got busy in their half and it ap
peared something was about to come off.
Â£hay walked and Mcany soaked one for
two bags. Then Leahy hit to Dillon, who
whipped the ball to the plate. Shay was
run down. The baU was then returned
to first and Leahy fell a victim to the
wiles cf Dillon. Injuring himself while
eliding to the bag.
Then the whole team went to pieces.
It was necessary to put Kelly behind the
bat, Krug at nret and Whalcn in the out
field. This did not work well at all. so
Deln-.as was shifted to first and Lynea
came In and played second, Krug being
chased again to the outfield and Hodson
relieving Herr on the slab.
It was no use. for the Angels were
there 10 win and they batted In runs at
any cost. They stole bases at will, for
Kelly could not throw. The hotae team
hit Corbett hard all the time, btit he was
rot triyng to pitch when the Angels got
about ten runs to the good. The score:

Â«Â»|r^HE steam schooner Francis H.
! Leggett. which will be due here to-
II day from Eureka, is bringing the
largest cargo of lumber ever
brought down the coast by a ves
sel of her class. She has on board 1,300,000
feet of lumber. After discharging this
she will proceed to Portland and from
there tow to this port a huge raft of logs,
one of two just completed and now ready
for the ocean trip.
The last log raft which was towed here
is said to have proved not nearly so
profitable as generally supposed. The
raft arrived cr.d was to all appearances
Intact. Many^of the logs spared by the
waves, however, turned out to have been
riddled by teredos and Instead of mak
ing good piling material proved of value
only as firewood. The construction of the
raft occupied about six months and after
Its arrival here many of the piles re
mained long in the water. The teredos
wasted not a moment and with their busy
augers spoiled thousands of feet of sound
lumber and bored holes In the profits of
an otherwise successful venture. In view
of what happened to the last raft con-
Fiderable interest is being manifested In
the fate of the one now awaiting the Leg-,
gett.
In shipping circles generally there Is a
strong feeling against ocean raft towing,
owing to the danger the rafts, in the
event of breaking up, constitute to navi
gation. If the teredos' ravages should
act to put a stop to the practice the
hitherto despised worm will In many quar
ters be regarded as a beneficial parasite
fit to be classed with those friendly shore
bugs that are doing so much to rid the
State's orchards of destructive insects.

T. J. Newman, proprietor of a" sailors*
boarding-house at 76 Jackson street, ap
peared before^ Police Judge Cabanlss yes
terday on a charge of battery committed
last Monday morning upon Arthur Cham
bers, a clerk in the office of the British
Consul, and during- his examination by
hla attorney. Archie Campbell, he made
serious charges against the British Con
sul. He admitted, however, â¢ that he had
no witnesses' to corroborate him.
The complaining witness testified that
Newman went to the consulate on Mon
uay morning with some sailors from the
ship' Drummuir "who -were to be paid off
and Newman . used very insulting and
abusive language. When remonstrated
with he put his elbow against Chambers"
throat and pushed him. aside continuing
his abuse. Chambers denied that he had
ever spoken to the defendant before and
hadnothlnff to do with himl
Newman was called to the stand and he
claimed that the officials at -the consulate
Intended to 10b the sailors and he went
with them to protect their richts. He
said as a Drooof of the animus of the
consulate officials against him thai the
British Consul had called upon him sev
eral times and had told him that his sal
ary was Insufficient to keep up his social
position and suggested that Newman pay
him $5 for each sailor shipped from New
man's place so as to get the protection
of the consulate.
"I rejected this proposal." continued
Newman, , "and told the British Consul
that if there was any robbery of sailors
to be done I could do it myself. I ship
about 100 sailors a month and that would
have meant 1500 to the Consul. _ There
was no one present at these conversations
except myself and the Consul. After my
repeated refusals, letters bearing the
stamp of the consulate were sent to all
the British ship captains in port request
ing them not to send any men to my
place."
In cross-examination Newman readily
admitted that he had conducted himself
in a boisterous manner at the consulate
on Monday morning;that he had accused
the officials of .robbing sailors and had
pushed Chambers aside.
Three sailors of the Drummuir were
called to the stand and they all testified
they received their full pay at the con
sulate and had no idea of being robbed
till Newman had mentioned it to them.
The Judge said he would take the mat
ter under advisement till Monday when
the charge against Newman of disturb
ing the peace preferred by Vice Consul
Moore would be heard.

A. W. Pape is staying at Annisquam,
Cape Ann, Mass., the summer home of his
brother. Eric Pape. the artist. He is en
deavoring to regain his lost weight and
vigor, and, if he succeeds In doing so;
will take part In the regatta at Worces-
The iunior four-oared shell crew, with
W. A. King at stroke. Is practicing every
evening and will pull In the senior and
Junior races at the regatta of the North
Pacific Association of Amateur Oarsmen
at Vancouver. B. C. The members of the
crew left Portland on Sunday, â¢ the 19th
inst., t for Vancouver, accompanied by
their coach. .
E. Gloss will represent the Portland
Rowing Club In the senior scull race, hav
ing beaten W. T. Patton In a trial held
on the Willamette River on Thursday
evening. thÂ« ICth Inst. The water was
smooth and the scullers sot away to a
good start. For the first quarter of a
mile the scullers pulled evenly but then
Gloss began to gain and continuing to do
bo won bv three lengths.
It is likely Portland will be represented
by two four-oared crews at Astoria. The
Liiders crew may be changed somewhat
after the Vancouver regatta. For that
event it was made up as follows: George
L-uders, bow: Klrkley, No. 2; Montgom
ery, No. 3; and King, stroke. If the crew
thus arranged wins at Vancouver it will
be entered for the Astoria regatta. If it
loses an effort will be made to strengthen
It. Â¦ '-> 'Â¦
The committee at Astoria expects the
single shell race will be an unusually good
contest. The championship of the Pacific
Coast will be fought for by representa
tives of San Francisco. Portland and
Britfsh Columbia. The oarsmen from
Portland and British Columbia row in
four-oared shells-, whi'.e the oarsmen of
San Francisco bay pull in barges.' It Is
proposed to exchange boats so that the
San Francisco men may pull in the shell
races and the Vancouver and Portland
men In the barge events. A member of
the Astoria committee started on the^th
Ins?t. for Vancouver. B. C, to attend' the
regatta there and arrange for oarsmen to
visit Astoria. The British Columbians
are anxious to take part in the Astoria
carnival and good crews are expected
from that place. Oswald West and
Charles V. Brown of the Astoria com
mittee were in Portland on the ICth inst.
consulting with members of the Portland
Rowing Club about the Astoria races.
Besides four-oared crews from Van
couver, B. C. there may be crews and
single scullers from Victoria and Nelson,
B. C. Many conoeists will go from Van
couver, where canoeing is a highly popu
lar sport.
It is proposed to invite two four-oared
barge crews, two outrigged skiff men,
one single shell man .and one or two swim
mer?. The committee will pay the trans
portation, board and sleeping accommo
dation of the oarsmen while on the jour
nev and at Astoria.
the single shell, four-oared shell, out
rigged skiff, four-oared barge and single
and double canoe races. The secretary
writes that the committee has not secured
as favorable rates as was hoped from
the steamship companies and so will not
be able to entertain more than flffen
oarsmen from San Francisco bay.
Thetis will be accompanied by Vice Com
modore A. C. Lee's sloop Surprise and pos
sibly by A. D. Moves' sloop Halcyon. J.
Cprcoran> launch will also make the trip. ;
The cruise will last two weeks. During J

l^ngor and Ariel will join the flagship.
J. R. Savory's sloop J uar.it u and F.' A.
Hyde's new launch Vladimir will proba
bly also make an up-river cruise.
It is not expected that the pleasure
craft will proceed higher up the Sacra
trsento than Courtland. On the return
trip it Is likely the yachts will sail
through the Three-Mile cut-off fr<5m the
Sacramento River Into the San Joaquin
and drop anchor at Antloch. The yachts
will make their moorings at Sausalito on
Sunday. August 9. It was hoped the
yawls Royal and Wave, with the sloops
Mitral and Curlew, might make the riv
er trip, but it seems they will not do bo.
To-day and to-morrow are open on the
programme of the Corinthian Yacht Club,
but as the tide floods until 1;35 p. m. to
morrow at the harbor entrance most of
the fleet will run up Into the upper bay,
dropping anchor at Mc>T<?ars Landing or
Paradise Cove.
To-morrow the yawl race of the Cali
fornia Yacht Club will be sailed over a
triangular course of ten nautical miles,
starting from the Oakland broad gauge
mole. The time limit for the race Is four
hours. Light sails may be carried.
The yawl Io!a is the scratch boat, the
others receiving the following handicaps
in minutes and seconds: Gypsle, 11:30;
Arcturus, 12; Idler, .21:30; Nereid. 27; El
Rayo. 28; Bachelor, 28; Pilgrim. 33; Mabel
a; Â«.
All contesting yachts should be at the
starting line at 11 a. m. and the captains
should report to A. R. F. Erandes, chair
man of the regatta committee, at the
vhaxf for further instructions and start
ing time. The race will be In charge of
the regatta committee, the members of
which are August R. F. Brandes, Charles
W. Muller and Roscoe L. Eames. Silver
cups mounted on ebony bases will be giv
en for first and second places.
Robert Vinotnt's yawl Iola. the yawls
Pilgrim, Idler, and Mabel A have been on
the beach during the week, being cleaned
and painted for the race. The mainsail
of the yawl Iola is being altered, as it
<JoeÂ« not set well.
The cutter Feu Follet of the South Bay
Yacht Club and the sloop Mist of the Cor
li.thlan Yacht Club have been at anchor
off the California Yacht Club house dur
ing the week. Dr. Spencer's schooner
Muriel, which was in collision with the
submarine boat McPlke, has returned to
Alviso after making temporary repairs.
The sloop Catherine, owned by J E
Back, returned last Sunday from a cruise
up the river, having made Sacramento.
The 6loop Nixie, formerly owned by ex-

The only nine in the league that Is not
and has not been playing the game is
Oakland, the disgrace of the Pacific Coast
League. Since the first day of the sea
son the Oakland team has shown itself a
third-rater. It has been steadily going
down the line till Lohman and his bunch
ore at the botorn of the ladder, where It
is hoped they will remain till all Is over.
It seems a pity that a few good men
should be buried in such a ball team.
There are some high-grade players on the
payroll of Ewing, but they -never have a
chance to shine the way the team has
been behaving. Other managers have
been able to get ballplayers to strengthen
their teams, but Lohman says it Is im
possible, so no one can blame the fans
if they boycott Oakland whenever it plays
here. fZ Â¦
San Francisco has an exceedingly good
chance to get first position by taking a
majority of the games from Los Angeles
this week and then by repeating the trick
at Portland next week. Judging from the
way the home team has been playing ball
for the past month, this feat will be
neither impossible nor difficult and is
liable to happen.
Then Portland and Seattle are rapidly
coming to the front and they may pos
sibly figure In the race before It is over
for keeps. Both teams are supplied with
the best men that can be had and both
are playing the game to a fare-ye-well.
There is no reason why they should not
do something before many weeks elapse.
NOT since the good old days
of the Ilalght-street baseball
grounds has there been such an
interesting and close race for the pen
nant as the present one in the Pacific
Coast League. Los Angeles, San Fran
cisco and Sacramento, the first three
teams, are all In a position to win out
and any piece of good luck or reverse in
fortune is liable to decide which club shall
float the coveted emblem when the season>
comes to a close.

Another surprise was the drubbing
Reuben Hunt received from Alexander,
the New York champion. After winning
the tournament so cleverly Hunt was
looked upon to have a chance for the
championship, but the score shows he was
completely outclassed, as he got but one
game in three /sets.
, The nineteenth annual tournament for
the championship of Southern California
will be held at Santa Monica during the
week of August 3 to 8. The following
events will be played: All comers' singles,
all comers' doubles, mixed doubles, ladies'
singles (open), ladies' singles (handicap),
junior singles, consolation singles. The
present champions are: Singles, L. R.
Freeman; doubles, L. R. Freeman and J.
R. Britton; ladies' slnRles, Miss May
Sutton; mixed doubles, Miss Violet Sutton
and S. M. Sinsabaugh.
Last year Drummond MacGavin and
Grant Smith went South and almost car
ried off the doubles championship. This
year MacGavin is in Nome . and the
chances are the North will not be repre
sented. Smith may join forces with
Harry Weihe, but tills Is little more than
a possibility.
Tho next tournament on the Park courts
will be a class singles. As Will Allen won
the cup for the third time in the last
tournament a new cup will be put up for
that class. The date of the coming
tournament is the 2d of August. If
the contemplated changes op the
public courts are made * before
August the tournament â¢ will have
to be 'postponed until the courts are com
pleted, but it is not thought that work
will be commenced by that time. The first
and fourth classes will be played on the
2d and the second and third classes on
the 9th of August. There Is some talk of
forming a championship class at the park.
The present arrangement is to put Harry
Weihe, Will Allen. Robert Whitney and
Grant Smith In this class. Routh. Dunlap,
Griffin. Baker and Adams and the others
would be in the first class. A better
plan than this would be to divide the first
class into two division?, calling the first
A division and the second B division.
The defeat of Champion Freeman at the
hands of Alfonso Bell came as a great
surprise to the local players. While many
thought Bell might be able to win oc
casionally from the champion, the defeat
of the latter in straight sets was un
looked for.
Hodgklnson is a powerful young man,
who plays an equally strong game in all
parts of the court. In practice during the
week Hodgkinson has appeared to much
better advantage than did Daily.- The
latter, while beseems to have muclfof his
former skill, is somewhat off in his play,
being a trifle lacking in accuracy. Hodg
kinson depends more on speed than any
thing else. In experience Daily has a big
lead over his younger opponent.
Both have many admirers who are sure
tl:eir man will win. Dally represents the
old school and has been a clever player
in his day. Sunday's match will de
termine whether Daily is to be classed
with the "has beens" or whether he is
still a factor in tennis.
There have been matches wherein an
amatuer has been pitted against a pro
fessional, but this is the first Instance of
two professionals coming together, In
fact it is the first time there has been
two professionals on the coast.

The majority of the sportsmen this year
favor the 30:30 caliber rifle which has been
so r â 'ilar In recent years. It is light in
Weight and handy to carry especially in
carbine form. Tne ammunition also takes
up but little space. The :33 caliber has
been gaining In favor, proving an arm of
great power. The experts in the gun
stores have reslghted thousands of rifles
in anticipation of the opening of the deer
season. Few use .the regulation sights,
the majority of sportsmen having Ideas
of their own in this matter.
Many deer have been killed in Marin
County within but little more than ' an
hour's ride of this city. Lake and Men
docip.o counties are continuing to afford
excellent hunting, althougn the deer are
keeping in 'th* thick brush at present.
Next month they will be found more in
the open and will be easier to bring down.
Thomas' Pennington, president of George
W. Pjmnington Sons, and George Penning

deer hunt in Marin County. Each sports

A test does not seem to do southpaw
Llndsey any good, as was demonstrated
In Wednesday's game. Harris had been
saving the little one for the series with
Los Angeles and he had not worked for
several weeks. Bat as soon as he went
up against the Angels he was hit hard
from the start. Whenever he works
right along he is moie effective and can
generally be depended upon to win a ma
jority of his games asainst any club In
the league, especially Los Angeles.
Poor Hollings worth la having his trou

now he seems to have about reached the
limit In thN line. Holly at first signed
with Morley. He jumped and this caused
the press and the general public in L03
Angeles to have it In for him and roast
him. at every *^rn.
He had smooth sailing for awhile till
he bumped up against Reilly's business
manager. Then he became angry, was
released to Seattle but was again on the

The coursing at I'nion Park to-morrow
will commence upon the arrival of the
10:15 a. m. train. There will also be a
train at 1 o'clock. The likely winner*
look to be:
T. W. Bartels, a prominent coursing
man of Denver, has a litter of grey
hounds by Said Pasha, a brother of Emin
Pasha, and out of the noted performer.
Mac's Melody, winner of ICOOu. In her time
she has beaten all the great greyhounds
of the West. There are eight puppies in
the Utter, five being dogs.
Imported Parton won the class stake
last Sunday at Butte, beating Lady New
ark in the deciding course. Parton Is
from the famous Pilkington Kennels of
England. He is by Mellormoor-Thought
less Beauty. He is the only representa
tive of the latter great greyhound ever
brought to this country. The open stake
at the same meeting was won by George
MacDougall's Kallspell, which beat the
Imported hound. Dartmoor Dan.
Eugene Geary has a young puppy by
Narcissus-Bonnie Lass which is a promis
ing candidate for next year's Futurity
A. R. Curtis' Charta was killed by aa
electric car some days since. The same
owner's great blue dog Beacon will be
trained again in an effort to bring him
back to his championship form.
In order to bring out the young cours
ers It Is expected some puppy and sapling
stakes will be run next month at Union
Park.
James Sweeney has three eligibles by
Rocker-Fiery Face which have never
been seen in public. They are built on
racy lines and are highly thought of by
the ktnnel connections.
Dr. F. P. Clark of Stockton was in the
city on Wednesday and reports his Fu
turity candidates as doing well. He will
start them In the next puppy stake to
give them experience on the field.
Pat Horgan of Concord has five by Wild
Tralee-Manila, which started once and
carried off all the honors.
Some months since Frank McComb,
with his five representatives of Fetter
Free-Motto, was thought to have a strong
hold on the Futurity. Since then Charles
C. Griswold has started his racy looking
black and white dog, Ml Amlgo. of the
same litter. His Impressive style has
made him one of the stake possibilities
which will have to be recokned with.
The friends of the veteran T. J. Cronin
think he will realize a long cherished am
bition by winning the stake with Fair
Tralee. This representative of Wild
Tralee-Falr Helen has performed bril
liantly on each of his public appearances
and will be a hard one to beat.
THIS year's coursing Futurity has
the most open look of any since
the rich stake was first competed
for by the best young greyhounds of all
the West. In other years there has In
variably been a prohibitive favorite, some
precocious youngster which showed un
usual class cither in private trials or la
puppy or sapling stakes.

ATLANTIC HIGHLANDS, N. J., July
24.â Shamrock III more than evened ac
counts with her pacemaker, Shamrock I,
to-day for the beating the challenger suf
fered yesterday. Sailing over a twenty
nine mile course the cup hunter beat the
old boat 8 minutes 11 seconds, running ten
miles to leeward; 5 minutes 10 seconds
beating ten miles to windward, and 7
minutes 19 seconds in a reach of nine
miles, 20 minutes 40. seconds in all. The
challenger's victory running to leeward
was flawless. Beating back Shamrock I
suffered a little of her loss in a calm
streak, and in reaching more heavily from
the same cause. Nevertheless the victory
was fairly earned, except that the differ
ence between the two boats was exagger
ated by the disadvantages the old boat
suffered.
.The Shamrocks will have a short race
to-morrow, after which they will be taken
out in drydock in Erie Basin and polished.

GALLAGHER'S CLEVERNESS
TOO MTJCH FOR MORENA
Heavy- Weights Fight Four Cautious
Hounds Before Large Crowd
at San Francisco Club.
Andy Gallagher, the Olympic heavy
weight, used his cleverness to good ad
vantage in his little engagement with
Walter Moreno, last nieht at the San
Francisco Athletic Club. The men fought
four rounds as the main event of the per
formance and Gallagher won all the way.
The show as a whole was an exceptionally
good one and the tiny gymnasium was
crowded to almost twice its capacity.
Gallagher, by his victory last night, re
tains his claim to the amateur champion
ship of the coast. His opponer.t was a
trifle shy in the rush game and failed to
hustle Gallagher around as he should.
Andy displayed his remarkable cleverness
throughout and landed the only punches.
Morena was In splendid condition, while
Gallagher was about the reverse. Still
the latter always looked out for himself
in the tight places and did some pretty
blocking- For a heavyweight amateur
match' the fight was decidedly tame. Not
a solid wallop was landed by either man
during the four rounds.
Kid Parker returned to the ring again
and put Jack Hart to the world of dreams
in two rounds. Harry Tenny rushed
Chick Bowman around till the latter
dropped at the end of the first. Mike
Synfy knocked Harry Brown out In four
rounds. Billy Perkins was finished by
Frank Borsl In. two and Billy Desmond

these streams are French, Berry, Chino,
Swamp, Camp, Dogwood, Flea Valley,
Rock, Butte and other creeks. Several of
these carry 2000 inches of water and fall
1500 feet in a distance of a few miles.
At Centerville. on Butte Creek, the Bay
County Power Company has a plant es
tablished which generates SOW horse
power. This power is transmitted to the
dredger district near Oroville, to Colusa,
Chico, Gridley and Willows and other
valley towns for light and power pur
poses. At Nlmshew, some miles above
Centerville and. on the came stream, this
company Is now building another plant;
a. storage reser\-oir has been constructed,
steel pipes are being laid from this to the
power-house on Butte Creek; this power
house is nearly completed and most of
the machinery Is in place. The road lead
ing from the power-house to the reservoir
is five miles long and is one of the most
picturesque drives in the State.
This same company has a number of
men at work on an additional plant at
French Creek. One of the features of this
plant is a storage lake. A large sawmill
for the purpose of utilizing the pine tim
ber growing on the tide of the lake will
be in operation by the first of August. A

power-house down to its location on the
river. The water will be carried from the
lake to the power-house in two thirty-

financiers of this State, Chicago, Boston
and New York, who, under the advice
end assistance of the leading hydraulic
end electrical engineers of the East and
West, have been quietly securing the
preat property and water rights compris
ing the Western Power Company. The
corporation is, by outright purchase, the
owner of about 15.000 acres of land. This
embraces all of Butte VfilXey and all of
the eastern arm of Big Meadows, the
source of the Feather River, and has been
eecured as sites for two enormous reser
voirs. The B'g Meadows reservoir itself
â¢will be the second largest in the world,
being surpassed only by the famous
Assouan reservoir, now being completed
In Egypt. The company has also appro
priated 120,000 inches cf the waters of the
North Fork of the Feather River and
Butte Creek to be used for power purposes.

THE ONE WITH THE IMPâ How in the world do you keep your baby so quiet
and happy thlÂ» dreadful trying weather ?
THE ONE WITH THE CHERUB-Why It's the easiest thing in the world. I take
a CASCARET Candy Cathartic every night at bed-time. It makes mother's milk
mildly purgative, keeps the baby's bowels cool and regular, stops sour 'curd
and wind colic. They work while you sleep, you know- greatest blessing for
surslng mothers. j^ :.' FRIDAY,. July 21â2 p. m.

Twenty-Eighth Republicans Meet.
Attorney. Moore here suggested that the
matter had gone far enough. Livernash
was explaining to Broder that a frog's
brain might be severed from its body. and
"No, sir, I do not," admitted Broder.
He also confessed that reflex- action was
a matter that he had not given as much
study to as to his present calling.
â¢ "Then, sir, you don't know that con
siderable knowledge is stored in the spinal
column?" asked Livernash.
LOCATION OF WILL POWER.
/'Don't you know, sir, that muscular
exertion must be under the direction of
will power?" asked Livernash.
"Now that Mr. Moore has instructed
you to answer," said Livernash, "do you
know that impressions are stored away?"
"I do. not know," replied the witness,
evidently attempting to control his tem
per.
"What college did you attend, elr?"
snapped Livernash.
"Lafayette College, for four years,"
proudly replied the witness.
"Did you take a metaphysical course
there, sir?" asked Livernash. -
"I did not," replied Broder. ... Â¦
NO PIANO PLAYERS.
"Well, take this case,", continued Liver
nash. "A man who has played the piano
for a year can more readily pick out the
notes at the end of the year than when
he first started in, can henot?" ' . -
*'I don't know. We don't have any
piano players out in our workshops," re
plied Broder.
This upset Livernash, who reddened and
complained that the witness was lni
pudent."
In the afternoon matters looked as If
there. would have to be an adjournment.
Livernash sought to get Broder to admit
that' all persons possessed stored experi
ence, and that they would thus with prac
tice become mechanical In their work.
Broder refused to answer the question,
and replied in the negative only upon the
suggestion of Attorney Moore, because
Livernash threatened to adjourn the pro
ceedings until he had communicated with
the arbitrators and asked them to instruct
that Broder should answer the question.
"Oh, you had better answer the ques
tion, or. any other," suggested Moore.
"We don't want any delays. 'Answer. any
thing he asks you." '. Â¦Â¦';"â¢ j,
"Do not laborers become more pro
ficient with a chisel after they have used
one for a year?'* he asK&d.
Broder replied that the laborers in the
yards under his control did such rough
work with a chisel that they could use a
chisel as good in three days as after they
been there months.
In the arbitration proceedings between
the carmen arid the United Railroads yes
terday considerable time was spent in the
discussion of subsidiary .questions. These
related to metaphysics and like studies. .
Livernash wanted to show the supreme
value of experience, so he split hairs and
dealt In .physiology, biology and mental
science He contended that gripmen
store experience in their spinal columns;
this because a frog's body appears * to
retain intelligence after the brain has been
removed. Attorney Moore thought the
point irrelevant.
Reflex action . was the theme of the
carmen's counsel, and he tried ! to con
fuse I the railroad company's witness
by plying unique questions. The Issue
throughout the wrangling and examina
tion concerned the Inquiry as to the ex
perience necessary to enable men to do
manual work or handle streetcars. There
were, * as usual, several petty verbal
clashes during the examination. Once an
adjournment was threatened. v .
"j Attorney Livernash peeviBh
when the railroad's witness minimized the
amoupt. of skill required, and he con
tended with spirit that â¢ experience was
vital to the successful handling 6t street
cars. He went so far as to hold that re
flex action is essential in all work, and he
examined the witness of the day with
reference to attainments in metaphysics,
particularly with reference to what he
knew about decapitated frogs. \ . v. . .
When. Master Mechanic F. F. Broder
started to testify LJvernash's temper be
gan to rise, for his rage flamed high
every time Broder intimated that operat
ing cars is not 'a work of skill. The at
torney ran the gamut of the various tools
us"ed by mechanics, and when the chisel
was Introduced he^ went after the wit
ness thus: Â¦ *Â¦ Â¦
