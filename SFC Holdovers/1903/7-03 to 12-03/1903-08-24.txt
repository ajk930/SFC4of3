"YV. O. Craig, a scout from Davlsvllle.
who was instrumental in running tnÂ«
convicts to earth, in an interview said:

"I was dazed for a moment," he said,
"and taken off my guard, so they got the
drop on me."
A Call correspondent interviewed Mur
phy in the City Jail late to-night, but he
was very sullen and refused to talk much.
He stated that he left Carson last night,
after putting in an enjoyable day there.
It was his intention to make Reno, then
try to board a freight train for the Ea3t-
When asked why he stopped while cross
ing the bridge, he stated that it was to
remove his revolver from his coat pocket
to a handler place in the front pocket of
his pantaloons. He said that he would
surely have killed Officers Maxwell and
Sharkey if his revolver had not caught in
his pocket.
"I would rather have been killed my
eelf than to return to that accursed
prison, he added."
When questioned as to who his compan
ion was he emphatically stated he would
not tell. -
"Catch him and you will then know."
he said, defiantly.
Murphy's whereabouts for the past
week could not be drawn out of him. He
said he did not see the officers until he
wa3 commanded to throw up his hands.
MURPHY IS SULLEN.
Miller was followed down the river bank
about 200 yards. Then he was tracked and
run up First street, bareheaded, keeping
close to the river. No attempt will be
made to-night to capture him owing to the
heavy growth of trees, willows and shrub
bery along the river. The officers havn
the* territory well guarded and it Is be
lieved that Miller will be captured at day
break.
MILLER SHOOTS AT OFFICER.
Deputy Sheriffs Will Maxwell and John
Sharkey were given the Virginia street
bridge, the most likely one for the con
victs to attempt to cross. At Just 9:30
p. m. the two escape? hove In sight on thÂ©
south end of the bridge, where Sharkey
and Maxwell were stationed.
The men walked to the center of the
bridge, stopped as though discovered,
then continued. As they reached the end
of the bridge the two officers stepped for
ward with a command to "throw up your
hands or you are dead men."
Murphy reached for his revolver, an
ugly looking 43 Colts, but was quickly
grabbed and handcuffed by the officers
before he could use it. Miller got hold
of his revolver, however, and exchanged
shots with Deputy Sheriff Maxwell. Mil
ler, after emptying his revolver without
any effect, Jumped off the bridge, a dis
tance of twenty feet, into the brush and
made his escape. Maxwell fired three
shots at the escape and thinks one of
them took effect, as the man could hardly

to capture the desperate men.
In the r-eantime the scouts kept the
convicts in sight from the rear, following
them into town. When Murphy and Mil

were again advised by the scouts that tho
desperadoes had entered the city. Ad the

JOSEPH MURPHY, one of the escaped convicts from Folsom, zvas captured at Reno,
Nov., last night by two brave deputies. He was armed, but zvas oz'crpoiuercd before he
could draw his revolver. Outlaw Miller, who was with Murphy at the time, jumped from
a bridge into willows growing on the bank of the Truckce River, after emptying his revolver at
the officers, and escaped. The officers shot at Miller, and believe one of their bullets struck him.
The Count was a gentleman of remarkable
attainments and of great travel. He was the
frequent recipient of letters from Holland and
also from Australia. He enjoyed the best of
health and I . never, heard or knew of him to
spe&k of any . organic heart trouble. He was
strong, active and vigorous when be left here.
Detective C. H. Taylor, who was at once
sent to look Into the case, would not ex
press an opinion as to the cause of the
Count's death. There was . certainly a
large degree of mystery connected with it.
The body was removed to the Morgue
and an autopsy to determine the cause of
death will be held to-day.
Dr. Julius Simon of the Maudsley Sani
tarium, where Van der Velde was em
ployed from the beginning of the year
until April 25, was greatly shocked to hear
of his death. He stated that the unfortu
nate man had filled all requirements while
in his employ and that he tried to pre
vail upon him to stay. Jle said:
Last night at 7 o'clock he stated that he
was eroinir to San Mateo on the electric cars,
and departed, taking with him bis effects.
He had been drinking a good deal lately and
was inclined to despondency. I think he must
have been almost penniless. I am not at all
surprised at his sudden end. ;
Dr. Alvey of 636 Kearny street, who was
a professional adviser and personal friend
of the deceased, stated that the Count
had a weak heart and he attributed that
as a cause of his death.
some money. He didn't seem to me to
be the kind of a man who would commit
suicide. He often talked of going home."
O. F. Woods, manager of the Tremont
House, where the Count had resided ever
since the first of the month, was the last
man that saw him alive. He said:
Van der Velde has made his home here oft
and on elnce last October.

PARIS, AugT 23.â The result of the
Humbert trial has caused a general feel
ing of relief, many, especially among the
lower classes, having feared till the last
that occillt influences would succeed In
procuring a verdict of acquittal. The in
tense interest .taken in the trial Is shown
by the fact that the presses of the news
papers could not reel off special editions
fast enough.- The -papers were immedi
ately snapped up' and' none reached the.
outlying quarters of Paris until quite late
In the evening^ when they were eagerly
bought at three and four times their reg
ular price. *
in "spite "of "her "defiant attitude when
she received sentence, Madame Therese
Humbert broke down last night on her
arrival in the Concierge Prison and had
*. long crying spell: The male members
of the party, though depressed, bore up
better. - ' \ Â¦ . . ''
1 Maitre .Labori, her counsel, visited Ma
dame Humbert this morning and found
her still prostrated, but she obstinately
maintained her innocence and denounced
the sentence as iniquitous. She and her
husband undoubtedly will appeal to the
Court of Cassation on the ground of
technical .irregularities. If successful in
their appeal they will be retried before
another Assize- Court, possibly at Ver
sailles.
LAWYERS ARE DISTRESSED.
Emile and Romain d'Aurignac will not
appeal, as, owing to the time they have
spent in prison awaiting trial, the period
of release on a ticket of leave will arrive
before a rehearing could possibly take
place. -
The defending counsel are greatly dis
appointed at the . result of the trial.
Maitre Labori refused to be Interviewed,
but his colleague, ' Maitre Clunet, ex
pressed his opinion that but .for the ill
timed and futile revelationsC of Madame
Humbert a general acquittal would have
been possible. Several members of the
jury who have given interviews are unan
imous in saying that the person who did
most td secure the conviction of the pris
onors was Madame Therese herself, be
cause her statements irritated the jury
men.
The foreman of the jury declares there
was no difference of opinion concerning
the guilt of Madame Therese and her hus
band, but the Jury's decision in the case
of the two brothers or d'Aurignac was
the result of much d^cussion. Their con-,
de'mnation was based solely on their com
plicity in the swindling operations In con
nection with the Rente Viagere Insurance
concern.
APPEAL Wllili BE TAKEN.
The aged mother of Frederic Humbert
and widow of Senator Humbert, whose
name has been mentioned in connection
with the Crawford swindle and with
whom Madame ; Humbert's daughter and
her sister. Mary d'Aurignac, .are staying,
received the news of tlje .condemnation
from a reporter. She bore up bravely
and' indignantly denounced : the Injustice
of the verdict; declaring that an " appeal
would be made to the Court of Cassation.
She and Eve Humbert were permitted to
see the prisoners this afternoon. Madame
Lucien Humbert, a sister of Madame The

LONDON, Aug. 23.â The stock market
experienced a listless week. Consols,
which recently hate been poured on the
market without any explainable cause,
closed a trifle better, but the check In the
rally of Americans and the ominous out
look In the Balkans acted as a deterrent
to any healthy legitimate business. Spec
ulators were exceedingly cautious In op
erating In American railroads, but the
belief prevails that a general upward
movement will set In.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 23.â With Increas
ing persistency rumors are coming here
from foreign capitals that several Im
portant changes In the personnel, of the
Washington diplomatic corps are con
templated. With one exception these
changes will probably not occur until
after the New Year's reception.
Senor Garcia Merou, Minister from Ar
gentina, who has for a long time expected
a transfer to Berlin, will present his
letters of recall at the State Department
this fall if the present programme Is car
ried out, and his successor may reach
Washington by January- 1st. Mr. Marou
has been- accredited to the Washington
government only since October. 1901, but
in that short time, by his- activity and
ability, he won for himself the title of
"dean of South American diplomats." He
was promised the Berlin mission months
ago and has been diligently studying Ger
man since spring. The rarge German
interests In Argentina make the Berlin
post one of great importance In the Ar
gentine service.
.Reports that Count Casslni, the Russian
Embassador, was not to return to Wash
ington this fall because of the Kishinev
incident and its. trying consequences, are
not credited by those in the confidence of
the St. Petersburg, foreign office.. How
ever, It Is gossiped that in the event of
such a change, Count Cassinl will go to
Berlin and* will complete his long diplo
matic career at the German court, where
he was once attached to the Russian em
bassy. Count,Casslni expects to return
to Washington in October or November.
Tho Russian Embassador to Germany I Is
a very -old man and he may ask for re
tirement'at any time. . â¢
When Slgnor Mayor des Planches,' the
Italian Embassador,- left- Washington thla
summer he said to a diplomatic - con
frere: "I shallsay au revoir to you, but
1 fear It is my good-by to Washington."
The retirement of â¢ the Italian Embassa
dor at Vienna' will result m a shake-up in
the Italian service and Signor, Mayor's
friends say his services will be needed at

curs. ' " '*" \-' '" . ' . . " Â¦ â¢â¢*â¢â¢-,"

PARIS. Aug. 23.â The death of Lord
Salisbury made a deep impression here.
Although the late statesman had retired
i:afi politics, the feeling prevails here
thai his disappearance Â¦will contribute to
strengthen the position of Colonial Sec
retary Chamberlain, which circumstance
Is not thought likely to promote friend
ship between the two countries. The
ability, prudence and moderation of the
former Premier are frankly recognized,
though some of his Fareastie utterances
ore recalled. It is acknowledged that
while he firmly upheld Great Britain's in
terests, at the same time he always
strove to prevent a. rupture with France,
and it is admitted that the Fashoda inci
dent would have been far more danger
ous had any other statesman been in
power.
Messages cf condolence are pouring in
at Hatflclfl House, The senders include
Kins Kdward and Queen Alexandra, the
Queen of Portugal and Â¦president Loubet.
Touching references were madÂ« to the
dead statesman in the pulpits of almost
all the churches in the United Kingdom.
There were many visitors to the village
of Hatfield to-day. The parish church
was crowded this morning, the worship
ers including Premier Balfour, the Earl
and Countess of Selborne. the Marquis*
perns and the members of his family and
household.
"The King has received â¢with profound
regret the news of the death of the Mar
auis of Salisbury, and his Majesty deep
ly deplores the loss of so great a states
man, whose invaluable services to Queen
Victoria, to the King and his country in
the highest offices of state which he held
Tor so rr.any years will ever dwell In the
ccnior)' of his feilow-countryraen."
LOXDOX, Aug. 23.â King Edward's tri
Â»ute to the deceased Marquis of Salis-
Hzry Is riven In the court circular to
cirht. dated Marienbad, Sunday. It runs
as follows:
The scene to-day was picturesque in
the extreme, when the red-robed Cardi
nal, surrounded by the Bishops and a
number of nuns, clad entirely In white,
proceeded to the symbolic function of
consecration. . The students of. the Amer
ican College came to Rome from their
villa at Castle Gandolfo. especially to as
sist at the ceremony. Cardinal Satolli
later cave a dinner in honor of Bishop
Hendrick. at which Archbishop Harty,
Bishop Cavallari and Monseigneurs Ken
nedy &nd Fowler were present.
Archbisnop Harty has booked his pas-
Sage on La Lorraine, which will leave
Havre for New York Augrust Bishop
Hendrick, who has received instructions
regarding the Philippines from the Sec
retary of State, will have a private audi
ence with Pius X and will afterward
leave for Ireland.' as he wishes to have
Irish nuns and monks sent to his diocese
of Cebu for teaching purposes. He also
desires that several Irish priests be sent,
at least for a time.
ROME, AuÂ«. 23.â The consecration of
the Hev. Thomas A. Hendrick of Roches
ter, N. Y., as bishop of Cebu, P. 1., was
performed this morning . by . Cardinal
Satolli in tne Church of the Franciscan
Missionary Nuns.
The occasion acauired special import
ance because one of Cardinal Satplli's
assistants at the function was Archbishop
Harty, Metropolitan of the Philippine
Islands, while contemporaneously Cardi
nal Satolli consecrated Monseigneur Cav
allari as titular Bishop of Philadelphia,
Asia Minor, whom Lie Pope has appointed
pro-Vioar of Venice. Pius X still keeps
for himself the Patriarchate, thus avoid
ing a revival of the question whether the
Italian Government has -the right to
choose the Patriarch of Venice, which it
claimed when Sarto was appointed to
that post. *

Marblehead\and Concord at Portland.
Bourassa's remarks were loudly ap
plauded and strong anti-imperial resolu
tions favoring the maintenance of the
status quo were adopted.
fn the event of war with the United
States, Bourassa said that the State of
New York alone could pour more troops
into Canada than the entire military force
of the Dominion. He did not wish a
rupture with the mother country
unless Chamberlain and the "Jingoes'*
forced their views on the people* of Cana
da, in which event the empire would
break up. He was in favor of the status
quo being maintained until Canada was
strong enough to strike out for herself.
Referring to Lord Minto. Bourassa de
scribed him as a good disguised rider of
English race-horses and a creature of
Chamberlain. Lord Mlnto had no more
right to take sides on such & question
than had the world's great peacemaker.
King Edward, and in doing so he acted
not as the representative of the sover
eign, but of Chamberlain.
MONTREAL, Aug. 23.â Henri Bourassa,
member of the Canadian Parliament and
formerly secretary of the Joint Commis
sion, made a sensational speech at ft
meeting of the French Canadians held
here to-night. .
Bourassa denounced the action of tile
Chambers of Commerce of the empire in
asking Canada to aid In Imperial defense,
and attacked Lord Mlnto, the Governor
General, for his speech in favor of the
preferential trade idea. Canada, he de
clared, should not contribute a cent* to the
defense of the empire. England should
provide the fleet and army necessary to
protect the provinces she acquired, and
pay for them without calling on a colony.
Canada would have enough to do to de
fend herself.

The United States training ship Alli
ance, which has been In the 1 harbor for
the past week, sailed to-night under or
ders of Rear Admiral Barker. It is ru
rnorcd that her presence was distasteful
to the defending forces, which, It is said,
thought her a spy.
Major Welch, N. G. S. M., late this aft
ernoon captured the wireless . telegraph
station near the Two Lights and put a
guard into the building to prevent Elec
trician Barbank, who was In charge, from
giving any information to the enemy,
with whom he Is supposed to be In league.
rtOCKLAND, Me.. Aug. 23.â The ves
sels of Rear Admiral Barker's attacking
squadron still remain in the harbor. There
are conflicting reports as to when they
will leave, the general belief being that
they will not do so before Monday after
noon, although they may depart between
midnight and daybreak. %
PORTLAND, Me., Aug. 23.-Major Gen
eral Chaffee, who is to be the commander
of the army In the war maneuvers at this
port this week, arrived here to-day. 'With
him were General Barry, Captain Harper
and Captain "Walker. Major Harrison ar
rived to-night. Colonel LIvermore and
Colonel Dunwoody, the other offlcers who
are to be associated with General Chaf
fee, have been in- the city for several
days.
"How busy we in the army will be for
the next few days will, of course, depend
on the navy." said General Chaffee. "The
troops will be over this vicinityâ that will
be their part in the affair. Neither the
army nor the navy Is playing for *icto
rles in this game. On the contrary, we
are . trying to eliminate any idea that
there may be a contest. It is a test and
practice of material more than anything
else.
"I will go about to various places here
to-morrow and Tuesday, visiting the
camps and -forts. Probably I will also
do this every day. But during the most
of the time I presume I will be on Cush
ing's Island, my headquarters, or on my
little boat, the yacht Kanawha, which
will probably get in here- to-night She
Is on her way from New York."
General ChafCee stated that Colonel W.
F. Stewart of Fort Hancock, N. Y., will
succeed Colonel Mills as the commander
of the military post3 In and about Port
land, and that this change will take place
within a month, or. as sÂ«Jon as the New

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug.* 23.â The close
contest between Mayor Tom - L. John

YOSEMITE VALLEY, Aug. 23.â The bi
annual Indian powwow and dance of the
Piute and Digger Indians began here -to
night with good-sized representations
from the different tribes located through
out the Yosemite Park and the' high
Sierras. The ceremonies were opened
with horse races from Sentinel Dome to
Sentinel Hotel this afternoon, the prin
cipal events being taken by Coyote Kid
and Smiling Jim.
In the evening the first of a series of
feasts was held at the rancherlo located
at the southern end of the valley and was
presided over by Uncle Paul and Mrs.
Uncle John, both of whom are more than
100 years of age. All were in full Indian
evening dress. Uncle Paul spoke elo
quently of the time when the noble red
man hunted the big grizzlies and the fleet
deer up and down the valleys and across
J the mountain tops from Glacier Point to
Mono Lake, and of feasts and dances at
tending the bringing in of the large game.
His remarks were listened to with grave
attention by the younger members of the
tribe as they sat before the campfire
smoking the pipe of peace. After the elo
quence had died away the war dances be
gan, led by stalwart Tom Lunton and
Sal lie Ann and consisted of numerous
contortions around the huge bonfires of
blazing logs. [ After the dance presents of
fine beads, wirework, baskets, tomahawks,
knives and other articles dear to the In
dian heart were presented to the visiting
members of the gathering. The dances
will last four days. This is the first dance
the Indians have given in five years, al
though meetings were held in Ahwahnee
four years ago and in M^riposa two years
ago. The dance was attended by a large
number of Grand Army., of the Republi6
veterans who are at the Sentinel Hotel. !

A San Francisco woman, claiming a divorce, de
clared in court a few days ago, as efforts were being
made to effect a reconciliation, that she would rather
kiss a Chinese than her husband. The study of
woman has always been one of the most difficult
problems presented to the students of manners and
morals. The fair sex never seems able to understand
that the worst of some species are incomparably bet
ter than the best of others.
A NOVELTY of the summer is the discussion
of mobs and lyrichirigs by the Chautauqua As-*
sembly. Senators Burton and Tillman have
been debating it in the various branches of the organ
ization in the West, and the parent assembly has had
a free discussion of it at Chautauqua. A Georgia
member justified lynching, and gave his reasons in a
temperate manner. Others combated his position
in an equally temperate spirit, and the discussion
seems calculated to do much good in forming public
opinion on the subject.
It is gratifying that in expressing their views upon
President Roosevelt's letter on lynching, a number
of State Governors accept The Call's suggestion that
the criminal laws and judicial procedure be so
amended as to secure a more prompt administration
of criminal justice. They regard this as the first step
to be taken, and it may be expected 5 that many Leg
islatures will take up that branch of the subject at
their next sessions. -

the problem by discussing that division. of it and, for

A delicious illustration of the delights of compari
son is furnished by the New York Press in a recent
issue. Taking advantage of the occurrence of a dis
astrous hurricane in the West Indies, that cheerful
paper asks the people, of New York to rejoice be
cause their climate is better and their summers safer
than those of Cuba or Jamaica. Cheered by its own
words, it goes farther and exults that the New York
ers are better off than the dwellers in other parts
of the United States itself. Thus it says of the
dwellers in the metropolis: "They may have a rainy
June, but the visitations of Kansas floods are un
known. They may have a torrid week in July, yet
no Galveston catastrophe has laid their city in ruins.
Though they may object to the translation of August
into October, they cannot bemoan a Missouri or
a West Indian tornado, and they have known no
Mont Pelee cataclysm. Their most reasonable basis
for a genuine grievance against the weather gods is
an occasional 'blizzard/ which is the weekly winter
fare of the Dakotas and the Canadian Northwest."
Having in that way built up the pile of argument
on behalf of the weather in that city, the Press rises
at last to the pitch of a true enthusiasm and, discard
ing the wings of the comparative, ventures upon the
absolute and says, "New York City is one of the
finest summer resorts in the world."

of the overdriven donkey and rejoice that he is not

The iron and steel trade is showing more hesita
tion and there is no longer any rush in filling orders.
Some of ( the raw zr.d unfinished products are lower,
with larger supplies than has been the rule for the
last four or five years. The demand for structural
material is light, but this is wholly due to labor trou
bles, which render capitalists and contractors shy
about embarking in new building enterprises. The
boot and shoe factories of New England report ship
ments of their output extremely large, in spite of
continued weakness in hides and leather. Lumber is
active except in the East, where it has not yet fully
recovered from the effects of recent labor disturb
ances. Provisions continue to drag, though the situa
tion at Chicago was somewhat stronger toward the
close of the week. Wheat weakened off a little, as
crop prospects in the Northwest were reported better
owing to improved weather.
The situation on this coast remains about the same.
If there is anything new it is a certain trend of farm
and orchard products toward higher prices, which is
not bad news. This applies to most kinds of grain,
ha)-, 1 hops, dried fruits, vineyard products, butter,
eggs, cheese, etc., and means more money circulating
in the country, more business among the general
merchandise .stores, good collections, good farm
v.2c<Â«s and easy funds at the banks. The cities feel
the benefits of these conditions and business contin
ues active all along the line. As far at can be seen
now there is nothing in sight to indicate other than
a continued period of prosperity on this coast
ihe fall trade is beginning to appear, somewhat earlier
than usual. Throughout the Western and Southern
States buyers are reported taking hold with liberal
orders. zrA no dullness of any consequence is re
ported from any section. In some parts of the Cen
tral West, where the crop prospects are not as good
as they -were, business is" below expectations, but
these sections arc comparatively few. There is more
or less corr.plaint that labor troubles are affecting
business here and there, but this adverse factor is by
no means as serious as a few months ago, when large
communities were idle on account of great strikes.
There are also complaints that railroad cars are again
: ->rcoming scarce, and that this is hampering the
movement of goods in many important regions. Col

reported. The bank clearings last week fell behind
those for the corresponding week last year 9.1 per

The British cruiser Spartiate consumed 7400 tons of coal
on the round voyage to China. Of this amount 3000 tons
was used on the voyage out and 4400 tons on the return
trip. This difference is said to be due to the fact that the
coal consumed on the outward voyage was chiefly from
bunkers at the Portsmouth dockyard, while on the return
the fuel, although of the same grade of Welsh coal, was
taken from bunkers in tropical and semi-tropical climates,
where its steam generating qualities had diminished. The
Two serious cases of lax discipline in the French navy
are narrated in Ueberall. One is that of the petty officers
and sailors of four seagoing torpedo-boats having published
in a newspaper their determination not to serve on board
their vessels. The cause of their . dissatisfaction Is that they
object to being under the command of the defense mobile,
and an inquiry into this affair has been 'begun by the law
department of the navy. The other, still more remarkable
Incident, is in apnnectlon with the cruiser Jurlen de la Gra
viere. The shiS had been ordered to the West India sta
tion, and was on the point of sailing, when a dispatch, ar
rive! from the Ministry giving the ship's company six days'
liberty, during which the Minister of Marine would scrutin
ize the ship's report of punishments hitherto meted out to
the men. It appears that a number of dissatisfied sailors
had complained to the Ministry direct instead of forward
ing their grievances through the commanding officer of the
ship, and M. Pelletan. Minister of Marine, not alone over
looked this gross breach of discipline, but has put the of
ficers of the ship on the defensive. These two cases ar?
unheard of in any navy and indicate the demoralizing effect
of a well meaning but erratic administrator like M. Pelletan.
Plans and specifications . for the new ships to be built
abroad for Japan *.ave been transmitted to the legation in
London. Contracts amounting to about $27,000,000 are to be
placed with j responsible firms and bids will be forwarded
during this month to the Admiralty In Japan for approval.
The ships to be built include two battleships of 15.000 tons
and three armored cruisers of 9000 tons. The collapse of the
United Shipbuilding Company makes It highly improbable
that any of these contracts will come to this country. The
Newport News and the New York Shipbuilding Company at
Camden have all the work they can handle for the United

A CHANCE TO SMILE.
The battleship Louisiana, building at Newport News. i3
19 per cent completed, whereas the Connecticut, at the New
York navy yard, is credited with 13 per cent and advanced
only 1 per c-nt during the past month, against 3 per cent
for the Louisiana. The contract for the Louisiana was
signed October 15, 1302, and her keel laid February 7 last.
The Connecticut's keel was laid on March 10. and the con
trast in progress of work is thus quite marked. Both ves
sels were authorized by act of Congress of July 1. 1202. and
the delay In starting the Connecticut was due to the fact
that much preliminary work had to be done before the keel
could be laid. The Newport News yard was not under a
similar disadvantage: its facilities are superior to those of
any other yard in the country; the experience gained in
building four battleships, Its trained office and yard force
and better business methods, as compared with those of the
navy yard, are distinct advantages. The- two ships are sup
posed to be completed by the same time, April 15, 1905. and
from present indications, barring accidents, the Louisiana
will be finished well within the limit and lead the Connecti
cut by one year. It is, however, yet possible for the navy
yard to make up for lost time. To complete the last 20 per
cent requires on an average about fourteen months la private
yards for this class of ships and if the Navy Department is
desirous of establishing a record for navy yard built shlp3
better headway may be made when the Connecticut ha3
passed the SO per cent stage and the finishing work begin?.
The July register of the United States navy Is. like that
of January last, a remarkable official publication because of
its great number of errors, which are due to careless com
pilation. It is supposed to give the station, ashore or afloat,
of every officer in the navy, with the date- of such assign
ment, and is more frequently consulted at the Navy De
partment, shore stations and on board ships than any other
book, hence it should be accurate. A cursory examination
reveals upward of fifty errors in dates and duties of of
ficers, some of which are quite ridiculous, as a few selections
will show. Lieutenant F. N. Freeman is credited to the bat
tleship Wisconsin under date of August 31. 1S37. notwith
standing the fact that the ship did not go into commission
until February 4. 190L Lieutenant Commander J. H. L. Hol
comb's'duty is alleged to be at coaling station Pollok. In the
Philippines, since December 8. 1SD6, which is nearly three
years* before Americans took possession of the islands, and
although such duty is counted as shore service, yet his sea
duty record is increased by six years and four months dur
ing the period up to date. Lieutenant F. Lyon is credited to
the Elcano since July 27. 133*. at which time the vessel was
still owned by Spain. Lieutenant A. M. Cook Is assigned to
the monitor Nevada since September 1. 1S39, which la thre*
years and a half prior to the vessel being accepted. Lieu
tenant H. E. Yarnall (Junior grade) is stated to have served
on the Berry, a torpedo-boat destroyer, since June 19, 1S97.

The magnitude of their control may be inferred
from the following facts recently published by the
Atlanta Constitution for the purpose of explaining
how that city would be affected by the deal: "The
Rock Island system originally began at Chicago and
ran out to Rock Island, where it fantailed in all west
ern directions as far northwest as Watertown, S. D.,
as far west as Denver and as far southwest as El Paso.
The Frisco began at St. Louis, ran to Springfield,
Mo., and there spread its fingers to Kansas City,
Oklahoma City, far down into Texas and southeast to
Birmingham, Ala. The Seaboard line began at Nor
folk, ran southwest, reached up to Richmond, east to
Wilmington and southwest to Atlanta and subse
quently secured lines to Savannah, to Montgomery
and' southward over Florida. It is now building a
connecting link between Alabama and Birmingham,
which will join it to the Rock Island and Frisco lines
at that point."
By this deal, which one authority declares to be the
greatest in twenty-nve years, nearly the whole system
of Southern railways" becomes divided into two great
groups, one controlled by the Morgan clique of capi
talists and the other by the Moore interests. The
new combination will, of course, affect much more
than the South, for the great West is also tributary to
the system. perceive then that new men have
arisen to compete with the Morgans, just as Morgan
came to compete with the Vanderbilts and the Goulds.
In fact the accumulation and consolidation of wealth
moves so rapidly in this country that hardly have we
become accustomed to look upon one set of men as
the plutocrats and railway kings of the land before
new aspirants arise to compete with them and to a
large extent subordinate them. Never in human his
tory were there such sudden leaps from comparative
poverty to affluence and power as are now going on
in these United States. The simplest statement of
the career of quite a number of Americans would if
presented artistically make a series of stories as start
ling in the vicissitudes of fortune and the splendors of
achievements as any that are to be found in the
Arabian Nights' Entertainments.
MANY methods may be found for illustrating
the rapidity with which American industry
advances and carries with its growth a change
in the existing order of things. In no other way,
however, is the "progress noted more interestingly
than in the development of new sets of men in the
ranks of leadership. Man is always interesting to
man, and the personal element involved in the rise
tq fortune of one who has been formerly unknown
attracts attention and compels admiration even when
the means by which success has been attained are not
wholly approved.
We have just had another illustration of that kind
in the career of the men who have just carried
through the deal by which the Rock Island Railroad
Company has obtained control of the Seaboard sys
tem so that the two are to be operated together. As
the Rock Island had already gained control of the
St. Louis and San Francisco system, the three are
now in combination and constitute what is said to be
the largest railway organization in the country. Alto
gether the three systems comprise upward of 18,000
miles online, or nearly one-tenth of the entire railway
mileage of the United States.
The men who have achieved this great combination
are brothersâ W.H. Moore and J. H. Moore. A few
years ago they were unknown and now they rank
among the foremost of our great railway kings. In
reviewing their work the Springfield Republican says:
"The {attainment of this vast power has been the
work of less than half a dozen years, with a beginning
in the possession of wealth not large enough to at
tract anybody's attention. The Moore brothers won
their money out of the steel combinations and they
have made it go uncommonly far^hrough the employ
ment of various devices for minority control, in build
ing themselves up as one of the three or four dominat
ing groups in the transportation industry. Their
rise is one of the wonders of the recent boom period."

Now, that is a very delicatessen in statesmanship.
The Senator has not had time to study either phase
of an issue on which he thinks his party can win next
year. He refrains from stating his own position, or
which side of the issue his party will take, but it is a
winning issue!
He then proceeds to talk about a flexible and emer
gency currency in a way that proves he told the truth
in saying that he was ignorant of the whole subject,
though not making a study of it. He is sure that
"the holders of trust stocks want a flexible currency
in order to prop up sagging trust values, which marks
a curious evolution, for only a few years ago thÂ»
claim was made that we had money enough."
The financial reformers who study the subject and
treat it scientifically have not treated the currency
condition as a problem of volume, but of distribution.
Under the present banking system the centripetal in
fluence of capital congests currency in the great
money centers, where the "owners of trust stocks"
and others enjoy the use of their .credit at a low rate
of interest because of the glut. At the same time,
business men of all classes, at a distance from the
financial centers, are compelled to use their credit at
a loss because of the higher rate of interest. Such
business men are scattered all over the country. If
they were concentrated at one point money would
flow to it in answer to a concentrated demand. But
the demand is diffused and its attractive effect is lost
It is conceived, then, from a scientific and Experi
mental standpoint that the remedy lies in permitting
local Rational banks, under stern official supervision,,
to issue upon approved assets an emergency cur
rency which remains out a certain time and then is
subjected to such tax as will compel its return to the
issuing bank for cancellation.
There may be a demand on a country bank for only
a few thousand dollars in excess of its currency on
hand. If it have assets to an equal amount that pass
official inspection it may emit emergency currency,
which the borrower gets at a reasonable rate, until
he turns his crop or his stock of goods. The circula
tion will be local only and the issue will be driven
in by the tax which at a fixed time follows it. This
is the system long successfully operated in Scotland
and Canada. Just how it can prop the sag in trust
stocks is invisible to the student of the subject. The
Senator does not say how. But declaring that he
has not studied the subject, he is prepared to say thai
such will be its effect.
His final benedictory utterance is really delicious.
Having said nothing, he closes with this: "What I
have said expresses my firm conviction on this great
financial subject. I believe I have uttered the true
Democratic faith on the subject; at least I know it
is the faith of the fathers."
He is like the man who was admiring the construc
tion ofa long water ditch in the Sierra Nevada Moun
tains, but said to a listening stranger, "They charge
too much for the water." The stranger asked. "What

know, but whatever it is, it is too much."
WE have had Democratic issues manufac
tured and handed down by all the eminent
prophets, seers and revclators of that party.
Mr. Bryan has on the market his well-worn questions
of the last two campaigns. Mr. ' Cleveland has mod
estly offered his tariff message of 1887 as one all-suffi
cient reason for the return of his party to power. Mr.
Gorman is in the ring with the* race question as the
Aaron's rod that will make all the other snakes hunt
their holes. Now comes Senator Daniel of Virginia
with some:lrng new. This is that Daniel who sup
ported in the Senate a resolution indorsing and com
mending the official conduct of President Cleveland
in the strike of 1894, and in the Democratic National
Convention of 1896 voted for a resolution censuring
and condemning President Cleveland for the same of-
VVith this grip on the confidence of the country in
his statesmanship. Daniel comes to judgment with
his issue. He will make it upon the proposed finan
cial legislation. In an official interview the Senator
say?: "I was extremely doubtful of the efficacy of the
Aldrich bill when it was first introduced. I have not
studied the subject, but my reflections have not in
clined my opinion toward that bill." He has reflected
upon a subject that he has not studied, and is there
fore equipped to give an opinion! As to the propo
sition to make the currency flexible, by its enlarge
ment in emergency, to be contracted when the occa
sion passes, he said: "This subject is too great a one
for a conclusion to be reached without the closest
study. I am therefore not prepared to express an
opinion on this phase of the subject. I am of opin
ion, however, that this question will be the leading
issue in the next campaign. It is an issue on which
the Democracy may successfully appeal to the coun
try in 1904."

dying of exhaustion from the excessive heat in' New
York right along, from May to September, we can
hardly admire enough the advantages of a compari
son of climates which leads a newspaper to make
an assertion like that. It. would be harsh and un
seemly to shift the comparison round and compare
the climate of New York with that of San Francisco,
for that would be to make New York look like
Hades. It is better to leave the thing as it stands,
and take it as an evidence that by making compar
sons a man can find comfort anywhere. In fact, com
parisons are not odious; they are full of sweet influ
ences, and old Dogberry was right in saying, "Com
parisons are odorous."

THE laying of the cornerstone of
the West Side Christian Church,
Bush street, near Devisadero,
was attended yesterday afternoon
by a large gathering. There were
clergymen from other churches of the
city and from suburban churches and a
strong and admirably selected choir un
der the able direction of Dr. R. W. Smith.
A temporary platform was occupied and
a large number of church men and women
and children sat within the uncompleted
walls of thÂ«> basement Just below the
platform.
With the hymn "All Hail" the exercises
began, and then the Rev. G. Greenwell
of the Tenth-avenue Church, this city,
delivered an Invocation, which was fol
lowed by the hymn, "I Love Thy King

NAPA, Aug. 23.â Congressman Bell ob
tained an option Saturday on ninety-five
acres of land on the Napa river known as
Horseshoe Bend. It is one of the places
where Bell will attempt to get an ap
propriation to cut the channel through to
straighten the river. Options have also
been obtained on land at Carr Bend and
Jack's Point, where the channel will also
be changed. The contemplated improve
ment, is an important one and will ma
terially lessen the time to San Francisco
by steamer.
Secures Option on Valuable Lands.
Several of the floor plates of the flre
room are warped from the heat. As near
as can be ascertained the fire st&rted in
the bilge, either from spontaneous com
bustion or by ignition from the furnace
fires. The drippings of oil from the feed
pipes had undoubtedly collecte-1 on the
surface of the water in the bilgo and In
some manner burst into flame.
The Whittier is a vessel of 793 tons dis
placement and was built at "he .Union
Iron Works, completed # about six
months ago. She is owned by, the Union
Oil Company, John Baker . Jr. manager,
and has been carrying oil between Ven
tura and Oleum. She made one trip to
Honolulu and was about to start on the
second voyage to the island port. The
tanks, with a carrying capacity of 10,000
barrels, are located in the forward por
tion of the vessel and are separated from
the fire and engine rooms by a cofferdam
filled with water. Tho officers of the ship
maintain that this bulkhead would pre
vent the communication of a fire in the
flre room to the tanks. It is believed that
the damage will not exceed $1000 and that
the steamer will be able to sail as sched
uled on Tuesday.
Captain McDonald of the steamship was
ashore at the time and the vessel was in
command of First Officer McGinnls. .He
stated that until an investigation was
made It would be Impossible to state posi
tlvey the origin of the flre or the extent
of the damase.
FI*AMES IN THE BILGE.
Upon the arrival of the department it
looked as though the ship was doomed to
destruction. Several lines of hose were
brought into play and the intrepid fire
men, undaunted by the knowledge that
they might be going to certain death, en
tered the vessel. It was found that the
flrV was confined solely to the flre room
bilge and the water poured into this com
partment'soon had effect. The two flre
boats had drawn up alongside ready to
turn their water batteries loose If neces
sary or tow the vessel out into tho stream.
. TUBNS IN ALAHM.
The odojr of the burning oil was unmis
takable, Sid not knowing the location of
"the nearest flre alarm box, he rushed to s a
nearby telephone and gave the alarm. A
call was sent in from box 352, which
brought three engine companies, one
truck, one chemical and the fire boat3
.Governor Irwin and Governor Markham
to the scene.
For a brief period last evening there
was much well-founded apprehension that
a catastrophe would occur in comparison
with which the loss of life and property
attendant upon the destruction of the
ill-fated steamer Progreso would pale
into insignificance. Only the prompt and
heroic work of the Fire Department pre
vented what might have been a repetition
on a larger scale of the horrible disaster
of last December. ,
Shortly after 8 o'clock last evening
flames were discovered in the fire room of
the steamer Whittier, one of the oil
carrying, fleet of the Union* Oil Company,
lying at section 2 of the seawall. In the
tanks of the vessel was stored 10,000 bar
rels of crude petroleum ready for trans
portation to Hawaii, and when at the ex
piration of thirty minutes' hard work the
firemen succeeded .in extinguishing the
blaze an audible sigh of relief came from
the crowd of spectators.
Second Officer J. S. Brooks of the
steamer George Loomis, also lying at the
seawall, , while walking the deck of his
ship noticed dense clouds of. black smoke
issuing from the grating surrounding the
smokestack of the Whittier.
Weis would have shot Hodge again as
he lay upon the sidewalk but for citizens
who seized him. He was arrested by
Constable Chambers, who telephoned to
the Sheriff's office, and a deputy was sent
to bring Weis to the county Jail.
Coroner Kitto was summoned from this
city to take charge of the remains of the
murdered man. Weis is a well-known
farmer of Sutter County. His wife is
connected with influential people. The
dead man is not well known here. He
worked for several years on ranches in
the vicinity of Knights Landing.
The shooting was the result Â«of family
matters in which Mrs. Weis figures. She
had left her husband and has been living
with her mother, Mrs. O. B. Green, in this
city. She does not care to discuss the af
fair.
WOODLAND, Aug. 23,-Charles Hodge,
a laborer who was employed on the Fair
ranch near Knights Landing, was shot
and killed in Knights Landing this even
ing by L. A. "Weis, a farmer who lives
near Cranmore, Sutter County. "VVeis met
Hodge on the main street, and, without a
word of warning, thrust the muzzle of a
revolver in his face and fired. The ball
entered just above the bridge of Hodge's
nose and death was instantaneous.

Loucks, the former Tacoma twirler, wag
right there in the morning game. He
shut Uncle's bunch out with three measly
hits. They never seemed to have a chance
at the new man, who had them at his
mercy in every round. Herr received mis
erable support and the team seemed to go
to pieces. Lindsey finally relieved him
and managed to do better, but the game
was already lost. Shay did not show up,
so Lynch had to 'play short Herr and
Lindsey did the stunts in the left garden.

It was hard luck mixed with a deal of
bad baseball that forced the visitors from
Portland to accept second money during
the afternoon struggle. They hit the ball
hard enough to win two games, but nearly
all their efforts were wasted, and not till
the eighth round did they bring a man
over the pan. Hard luck also figured
some, but not enough to effecfthe North
ern clubbers had they played the game
as they ghould in the tight 'places.'
The men from the North hit Hodson at
will from the first Inning on, but they
never seemed able to bunch enough of the
safe blngles to bring in runs. Thielman.
for the visitors, was a mystery, yet the
home stickers managed to set to him for.
three runs, enough to^win the game and
with one to spare.
The fourth Inning brought disaster to
the Portland men. Delmas, the first bat
ter up, got a pass to first, and Hodson
laid down a bunt. ' Van Buren - dropped
Thielman's throw and Hodson was safe.
Shay struck out, but/Meany was there
strong enough to worK the German slab
ster for a base on balls and the bags were
loaded.
Irwin flew to the right garden and Del
mas had ample time to beat the throw to
the plate. Thielman secured the ball and
Insisted in throwing it to second tcf catch
Meany napping.
Meany was not causht asleep. Instead
he hugged the Dag and Thielman's throw
went far to the outfield. Hodson came in
amid the cheers of the multitude while
the Portland fielders were giving chase to
the elusive leather as it wended its course
out to. the score board.
During the next spasm the home team
got In the third and last tally. Pabst
was lucky enough to tear off a hit which
barely escaped the clutches of Holllngs
worth. Krug bunted and the big first
baseman rested on second. - Sammy Vig
neux, who had taken Shea's olace after
the latter had. been Injured In the previous
inning, allowed one of Thielman's . fast
ones to Dass him. This put Pabst on
third. Lynch's out from second to
first was enough to j bring Pabst ' bi with
the last i tally for Uncle..
The Northerners were blanked to a fare
ye-well till the eighth, when Thielman
solved one of Hodaon's slow ones , and
sent it out to left field for a three-bagger.
Blake was also there with a swat. As
his bingle was traveling out in the dlrec
tlorrtff left Thielman sneaked in with the
only tally for the Portlanders. Score:

to shoulder 127 pounds Impost, that has
proved too much for him In previous
aaccs.
August Belmont's Magistrate Is the best
eligible in Trainer Hyland's care.
Of the colt division there are many dan
gerous factors. John E. Madden has pre
dicted his colors will be carried in tri
umph by Adbell. Many turfmen are in
clined to the belief that James R. Keene
will furnish the Futurity winner in his
bis Kingston colt, Delhi.
â¢ W. C. Whitney will probably start Stal
wart, Mercury and Hylas. The first
named has been running In rather disap
pointing mai:ner at the Springs. Mercury,
in spite of fast trials, appears to be slow
in coming to hand. S. S. Brown's hopes
are centered in his game little son of
Ben Brush, Broomstick, which will have
and Is a sure starter. Other fillies of note
mentioned as possible starters are August
Btlmont's Beldame and R. W. Walden's
Contentious.
the great race is proved by the report
that is prevalent that he has already
Â¦rascred $3000 against $15,000 with "Dick"
Krstrick that she will defeat her field. C.
Fellows Jr. has also wagered $2000 on
Han-.Karg Belle at the same odds.
Fred Gcbhard believes he has Hamburg
Belle's equal in the Plaudit nlly Raglan,
which he purchasea recently from John
K. Madden at Saratoga. Raglan is a half
;:iÂ£ier to Gunfire and has already shown
both high racing quality and stamina.
Another crack filly which earned brackets
early in the season is Foxhall Keene's
Dovecote, by Kingston-Cushat. She has
been especially reserved for the Futurity
That Sydney Paget thinks she will win
NEW YORK. Aug. 23.â The greatest
two-year-old event of the year, the $50,000
Futurity, â¢will be run at Sheepshead Bay
next Saturday. From present Indications
ihe race will attract possibly twenty colts
and fillies tf the post.
The KTcat flight of speed displayed by
Sidney Pagcfs Hamburg Belle In the fifth
race yesterday and her prospects of win
ning the Futurity were the subjects to
day of wide discussion. She will have 114
pounds up and Fuller will ride her. With
hor wonderful quickness at getting away,
as well as the well known disposition of
Fuller to take chances, her chance is re
garded as second to none. It was~not
known until to-day that Fuller rode the
filly yesterday with both feet out of the
stirrups for the first nfty yards or more.
The reason she did not burst away from
hf-r field at once was because her Jockey
was busy getting matters straight. In
cplte of this handfeap she ran the first
furlong in 10 4-5 seconds and the quarter
in Â£2 4-5 seconds. She won with such ea^e
â¢.hat turfmen declared that if the race
was at one mile she would have won by
a quarter cf a mile.

took Wheeler off second base to-day and put
him in the box. That is the chief reason Oak
land failed to score a run or get anywhere
near the plate. Three singles was all Loh
man's cripples could do with Wheeler's curves.
Cooper was easy for the locals. His support'
was ragged at times. Mardock made a circus
catch of a long hit from Corbett's' bat. Cor
bett played second baae in fine style. He also
scored a home run hit, which fell near the
spot where Truck- Eagan's famous long hit
landed. Captain Dillon was presented with

The rifle ranges at Shell Mound Park
were crowded yesterday with members of
the Nationals, San Francisco Schuetzea
Verein, Golden Gate Rifle and Pistol Club
and the Red Men's Shooting Company.
The San Francisco Schuetzen Verein held
its forty-fifth annual xestival. The State
shoot of the Nationals resulted in some
fine scores, several of the guardsmen at
taining the possible at the different dis
tances. C. C. de Wolf, J. Meyer, Cor
poral J. W. Cobby and W. S. Collett each
made 25 points at the 200-yard ranfe. A.
E. Anderson and F. J. Kane scored* thÂ©
possible at 300 yards. F. J. Povey. H. L.
Musgrave and C. F. Waltham performed
the difficult task of making the possible
25 points at the 500-yard target. .
F. J. Povey did the best shooting of the
day for his organization, making tfe ex
cellent scores of 23, 24 and 25 a't the 200,
300 and 500 yard targets.
Colonel Delos D. Neer of Portland. Pr.,
who served during the Civil War with
Captain L. Slebe, was an interested spec
tator and tried his hand and aim at the
military target. The colonel and Captai:;
Slebe served in Company K. One Hundred
and Thirty-third New York Volunteer In
fantry Regiment. As they had not met
for more.than thirty years* they made the
most of the occasion.
Collier and Mitchell have been practic
ing regularly and are at their best. Col
lier has concluded that his driving game
is not certain enough to win for him in
a tournament and is practicing chopping
the ball. Mitchell has a variety of strokes
and does not depend entirely upon any
one. .Of the three MacGavin is probably
the strongest player. Much Is expected
of him in the San Rafael tournaments.
He will again play with Smith in the
doubles. They are counted upon to win
the tournament and contest with Bell and
Freeman for the championship.
On the California courts Grant Smith
and Harry Rolfe had a good three-set
match. Smith won all three sets, but
Rolfe made a good showing. The win
ner had a variety of serves that kept his
opponent guessing throughout the match.
Herbert Long played five sets with Har
ry Butler. After losing the first one by
a small margin he took the next four, all
of which, however, were close.
The best matches on the park courts
were two doubles, in which the contest
ants were Harry Routh. Clarence Grif
fin, J. R. Lewis and Charles Foley. In
the first match Routh and Foley won two
sets out of three and in the second Lewis
and Griffin won two straight. Lewis has
shown wonderful improvement in the last
two months. He has already worked his
way up to the top In the third class and
will probably go Into the second before
long.
The matches played on the various
courts resulted as follows:
San Rafael â Drummond MacGavin beat W.
B. Collier, 6-4, 7-5, 2-6; Frank Mitchell beat
MacGavin. 7-5, 6-4, 8-2; Collier beat Mitchell.

The . most interesting matches were
played across the bay'on the Hotel Ra
fael courts. A good doubles match was
scheduled, but Grant Smith missed the
boat and . Drummond MacGavin, William
Collier and Frank Mitchell were forced
to conflna their play to singles. The un
certainty of tennis was shown by the
three in their singles matches. Each of
the three met the other and won and lost
a match. MacGavin beat Collier, Collier
beat Mitchell and Mitchell beat MacGav
ln. Mitchell led the other two on the
number of sets won. He won three
straight from MacG&vin, whiie the other
matches were two sets out of three. The
tennis was of a much ulgher class than
usual. MacGavin is hardly in his oM
form yet, out with practice next week
shouiu play a strong game in the tourna
ments.
The California Club, the park and the
San Rafael tennis courts were unusually
lively yesterday on account of the ap
proaching coast championship tournament.

the two masked highwaymen who held
up and robbed the conductor and motor

they would hardly be able to identify
them if they should be caught.

Euhlin Wants to Fight Jeffries.
LOS ANGELES. Aug. 23.â Billy Madden
is after Champion Jeffries in behalf of
Gus Ruhlin. Madden claims he is willing
to match Ruhlin against the champion,
winner to take all. "I don't think Mon
roe" has any license to challenge Jeffries,"
said Madden.- "He has never done any
thing. Ruhlin has, and all that Jeffries
will have to do to get on a match is to
agree to meet my man. I know he made
a poor showing the last time against
Jeffries, but he can do a great deal bet
ter and I think he can beat the cham
pion."
To these overtures Jeffries replies: "I
will fight anybody but a negro." which
would indicate that a match between the
two biff men is not altogether improba
ble.
P. Pedersen, who understands and writes
music, but who cannot play, are the in

The sightless musician he%rs the melody,
and as the tones impress themselves on
his delicate senses with remarkable ac
curacy translates, as it were, to the ready
assistant, Pedersen. With pen in hand
Pedersen rapidly . writes the score, and
thus the inspired composer sees his
thoughts given permanency.. {Â¦
Thus was the "Ta.Deu,nV^brought Into

themes with which he embellishes
his bits of sentiment Some of his
recent songs are written around verses
which were the outcome of boyish senti
ment during school daysâ long before he
dreamed that he would ever enter the
ranks of ambitious composers. Among
some of Rose's recent compositions Is a

The carcass was taken into the express
office and skinned, but as thÂ© season is
not right for pelts, it is likely "that the
fur will drop off. This was the flret bear
hunt that has been had in this city for
many years.
The consensus of opinion at the Sacra
manto depot was that the bear was scared
to death.
Inasmuch as the bear refused to go to
sleep like a good bear, and showed the
utmost contempt for strychnine, stringent
methods were resorted to. Two trusted
employes of the express company, re
puted to be dead shots, were told off to
execute the pesky varmint. They were
armed with regulation revolvers ana be
gan pumping lead at bruin. That mado
him mad. and he thrashed abound threat
ening to destroy not only what was left
of his cage, but the entire car. Ten bul
lets were fired Into him and he was pep
pered from his stub of a tail to hla perky
ear3. An ugly looking sawed-off shotgun
was then brought Into play and at the
first volley, bruin turned up his toes and
died.
Matters were becoming serious, and as
the bear was getting a good grip on an
other rod. the baggage men rolled his
cage over until the defective Iron bars
were against the side of the car. and
then piled all their trunks and va'lse3
upon and around it to keep it there. It
is even said that they took turns sitting
on the pile of trunks.
The train arrived In this city at 9:30
this morning and something had to be
done. The people who had traveled to the
capital wanted their baggage and the
Southern Pacific Company wanted Its car.
The bear had possession of both. The
Wells-Fargo Company had undertaken to
deliver bruin to its 6wner in Los An
gcles, but to remove the cage from the
wall of the car meant that the bear would
have full swing Qf tha car an- possibly
of the depot.
One bright mind suggested that chloro
form might quiet bruin's nerves, but tha
shaggy fellow declined to smell of a
drugged handkerchief when it waÂ» poked
at him on the end of a bamboo fishing
pole. Then another genius suggested poi
son, and an apple was doctored with
strychnine and passed In. The bear ate
the apple, but refused to die. The ex
press company's officials, who were In a
hurry, scratched their heads and the rail
road officials, who were pressed for time,
swore that the car must bo put into ser
vice again.
SACRAMENTO. Aug. 23.â A bis; brown
bear was caught In a trap in the moun
tains back of Sheridan, Placer County, a
few days ago, and was sold to a Los An
geles museum man. Bruin was placed
in a big box, across thÂ© top of which half-
Inch Iron rods were stretched. The bear
took matters philosophically during the
journey by wagon to Wheatland. where
it was transferred to a baggage car and
started on its journey to Los Angeles by
the way of this city.
Bruin grew curious after the train
started and began to investigate. It
reached up, took hold of one of the half
inch rods and bent it double without ap
parent effort. It stuck one paw through
and reached around for the baggage Jug
gler, and failing to find him. ripped out
another bar.
The Iroquols Club has secured accom.
modations near Larkspur, Marln County,
for the holding of a bullshead breakfast
on September 9 to celebrate the twentieth
anniversary of the club's organization. A.
D. Pratt, J. G. James, T. J. Walsh. H. L.
Bienfleld and S. S. Bayley have charge of
the arrangements for the breakfast.
There are indications of a warm contest
for the nomination of District Attorney
on the Republican ticket. General. E. S.
Salomon has developed considerable
strength, and Frank McGowan has an
active following.
Registration for the municipal election
on Tuesday. November 3. will close Sep
tember 21 Party nominations must be
filed between September 13 and October 4.
Independent nominations may be filed as
late as October li. The Election Commis
sioners will appoint officers of election on
September S. The polling places will be
designated October 8.
The Republican nominating convention
is called to meet September 15. It is un
derstood, however, that the convention
will simply organize and adjourn for a
week. The Democrats expect to follow
their customary plan of waiting until the
Republican ticket is placed In the field In
order to measure the strength of the Re
publican forces. .. :
It is gossip in the Republican camp that
the Democrats will not have much time
left to frame their ticket after the Re
publican nominations are made.
Wednesday evening next representatives
of the several Assembly district cltfbs of
the United Republican League will meet
to consider the subject of registration.
Special efforts will be made to get every
Republican voter on the register. The
leagues system of reaching the non-reg
istered Is very nearly perfect.
It is the common impression In political
circles that the Republicans will win out
next November if the convention places a
fairly good ticket in the field. There is
talk to the effect that Tax Collector
8mlth. Treasurer McDougald and Aud
itor Baehr will be renomlnated. The
Treasurer, however, is frequently spoken
of as an available man for Mayor. The
merits of A. P. Williams, Henry J. Crock
er, C. S. Laumeister. John C. Kirkpatrick,
P X L'lienthal, Charles A. Murdoch,
Thomas V. Cator and W. G. Stafford are
discussed in connection with the Mayor
al ty.
When the franchise does come up It is
almobt certain to be granted. Trustees
Ryder, Connor and Rickard favor it and
Trustee Staats, who has not committed
himself yet, is said to be ready to vote
with them. Trustees Dowd and Ferrier
opposite it and Trustee Hoff Is said to be
with them, though no one knows exactly
what is his position. So. if they vote ac
cording to this line-up, there will be four
votes for the franchise, three against It.
I don't want to commit myself as to my
vote now, as I want to keep my mind open
for conviction In . case any other good site la
suggested, but as It looks now It Is not likely
that there will be any better tlwn South
Berkeley.
I know the freight yards will hurt the value
of the property some. But I'm sure that will
never be a very good residence district anyway.
It Is more likely to be In time a. business dis
trict. We can't make the railroad go to West
Berkeley. The Southern Pacific came here first
and is Identified with the growth of the town,
and It would not be right to ask it to put its
freight depot a mile farther from town than
the Eanta Fe.
As to the second question. It eeenu to me
South Berkeley is the roost feasible site for the
yards. The railroad proposes to make the
yards there as sightly as possible. It wouldn't
be half so bad as the present lumber yard.
The element of danger would be reduced by the
inclosure of the yards. In a place so sparsely
settled I can see little reason for accident. And
wherever there is a dangerous point you may
be assured It wHl bÂ« safe-guarded. The greatest
danger would be to people oh \te trains, not
to the residents.
There are two questions Involved In this
matter â one Is whether the yards ought to
be removed: the other Is, tp what place should
they be removpd. As to tbo first question, I
think It Is well settled that the present yards
are unsightly and that they give visitors a bad
impression, besides being dangerous.
Town Trustee Fred F. Connor returned
from a sixty days' leave of absence In
the East last night and now there Is a
fair chance that the controversy that has
been going on for months over the re
moval of the Southern Pacific freight
yards -will be soon settled. The Trustees
meet to-morrow night, but whether the
railroad's application for a franchise for
yards at the gore In South Berkeley,
bounded by Shattuck avenue, Adeline and
Russell streets, will oe taken up then
is a question that will only be solved when
the meeting is held. The Trustees may
not- be prepared to act bo soon after Con
nor's return, In which case the matter
will go over until the next meeting.
Trustee Connor is in pretty much the
same frame of mind now about this fran
chise as he was when he last sat with
the board sixty days ago. At that time
he voted to grant the franchise, though
it was defeated by a tie vote. Since then
he has read of the fulmlnatlons of South
Berkeleyans protesting against the freight
yards, but a talk with htm reveals that
he has not been influenced by them. Still
he refuses to say how he will vote on the
franchise, preferring to await the board
meeting before giving his final decision,
as some other proposition may come up
that will be as good a,s South Berkeley.
Trustee Connor to-day said:' i

Cyril Greeley, 5 years of age and a son
of M. A. Greeley, contractor, 341 Twen
tieth avenue, died at noon yesterday at
his parents' residence from injuries re
ceived on Saturday afternoon. . The
Morgue and police headquarters were no
tified, and Deputy Coroner Meehan and
Detective T. B. Gibson went out to the
house. After Inquiry it was found that
the boy's death was accidental, so the
body was not removed.
The boy was riding a velocipede near
his home and he collided with a beer
bottling wagon that was standing In
front of the home of his grandmother,
Mrs. Casserly. He was thrown to the
ground and one of the horses kicked him,
breaking his collar bone and three of his
ribs. He was carried home and Dr.
Proschold was summoned. The boy was
unconscious and remained so to the end.
No blame is attached to the driver of the
wagon.
was no money In It. A roller desk had
been forced with a heavy pair of scissors
belonging to the office, and all the draw
ers searched for coin, and one of the
locked drawers had the. bottom knocked
out of it. Several men were working all
night on machines In the printing room,
but the noise of the machinery prevented
them from detecting the burglars.
Entrance was effected by opening the
door leading to the premises of the Pa
cific States Type Foundry, which, before
deserting, the burglars bolted from the
insldp. It Is not known what damage
they did there or whether they got any
money, but after finishing th'ere they as
cended in the elevator to the next floor,
and thence to the. top floor.
They ev.'dently made their exit by the
door leading to the premises of the Brown
Â«'Â£ Power Co., as It was left open. There
the drawers In the desks were forced
open, but the loss. If any, will not be
known' till this morning. No attempt was
made to break open the safes in either
the Brown & Power Co.'s office or in the
office of Phillips, Smyth & Van Orden.
The police were notified of the visit of
the burglars and two detectives were de
tailed on the. case.

surpassing excellence from a musical
standpoint.
The choruses "Vater Rhein," and "In

the former by the combined voices of the

and the latter by a chorus composed of

There were numerous numbers, but
none were more heartily received than

The object is to interest the boys in
charitable work and get them to feel
they are performing some real service.
The special field expected to be developed
is in the line of service for the sick and
afflicted, carrying flowers to the sick,
food to the hungry, comfort to the dis
tressed, distributing Christian literature,
competing with Uncle Sam in carrying let
ters from the teachers in the Sabbath
school to the absent scholars and such
other service as the pastor and Sunday
sohool officers may require. i
The work was organized by Superinten
dent C. B. Perkins, who has always taken
a deep interest in the boys. Twenty-seven
of them marched to the front of the plat
form, and after being addressed by the
pastor agreed to obey the rules of con
duct enjoining regular attendance at the
Sunday-school, avoidance' of the use of
tion of a society known as the
"King's Messengers." The address was
given by the Rev. Dr. Stephens, pastor of
the church.

The various delegates to the encamp
ment from interior points got out of the
city on the late trains Saturday night or
went yesterday morning. Early yester
day the contractors who had charge of
the work of decorating Market street em
ployed their men in removing the flags
from the poles that were erected along
the sides of the thoroughfare and to-day
the electricians will begin removing the
lights that added to the brilliancy of the
encampment festivities.
Among the other notable old soldiers
who left for the East yesterday were Cor
poral Tanner, Past Commanders in Chief
General A. C. Weissert of New York,
Louis Wagner and Pension Commissioner
James A. Ware. They were bound for
Southern California.
AÂ» noon the Pennsylvania special, con
veying a large representation of that
State and the battle flags, which formed
an interesting feature of the parade on
Thursday, left the Oakland mole on its
homeward Journey. Attached to the train
was the private car of Past Commander
in Chief Stewart and the former mem
bers of his staff, who accompanied the
Pennsylvania party to the coast.
The Minnesota delegation, with General
Torrence one of the party, left for home
during the forenoon, and about the time
these delegates were starting several
other trains containing delegates from
Boston, from various cities in Illinois and
Iowa and Nebraska were leaving for
Southern California. The majority of the
delegates from these States came west
by way of the Central Pacific and Union
Pacific and had arranged to leave the
State by its Â¦ southern gates. They pur
pose to stop in Los Angeles, where they
will be entertained by the hospitable peo
ple there, and will then continue east
ward, a number intending to make a
short stop at the Colorado Canyon.
Commander in Chief John C. Black left
his apartments at the Palace yesterday
and went to Berkeley, where he will be
the guest of his married daughter for
several days, and with her he will then
journey to Southern California for rest
and pleasure.
The bulk of the Grand Army veterans
who enlivened the city with their pres
ence at the encampment last week have
taken their departure and the few that
remain will probably get away to-day or
to-morrow. Every outbound train yester
day carried away hundreds to various
points in the southern part of the State,
and the ferry-boats were crowded with
old soldiers bound eastward by way of
the Central Pacific, or who contemplate
vlsitiny the northwest before returning
to their homes on the other side of the
Rockies.

Al distressing case of Fibroid Tumor,
which baffled the skill of Boston doctors.
Mrs. Hayes, of Boston, Mass., in
the following letter tells how she was
cured, after everything else failed, by
Lydia Â£Â£? Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
Mrs. Hayes* First Letter Appealing to Mrs. Pinkham for Help :
"Deae Mns. Ptn-kham: â I have been tinder Boston doctors' treat-
ment for long time without any relief. They tell me I have a fibroid
tumor. anndt sit down without great pain, and the soreness extends
up my s) e. â¢ I "have bearing-down pains both back and front 3Iy ab-
domen is swollen, and I have had flowing spells for three years. My ap-
petite is not good. I cannot walk or be on my feet for any length of time.
"The symptoms of Fibroid Tumor given in your little book ac-
curately describe my case, so I write to you for advice." â (Signed) Mrs.
E. F. Hayes, 202 Dudley St, (Roxbury) Boston, Mass.
Note the result of Mrs. Pinkham's adviceâ al-
though she advised Mrs. Hayes, of Boston, to take
her medicine â which she knew would help her â
her letter contained a mass of additional instruc-
tions as to treatment, all of which helped to bring
about the happy result.
"Deak Mrs. Pixkiiam: â Sometime ago I wrote to you describ-
ing my symptoms and asked your advice. You replied, and I followed
all your directions carefully, and to-day I am a well woman.
" The use of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound entirely
expelled the tumor and strengthened my whole system. I can walk
miles now.
** Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is worth five dol-
lars a drop. I advise all women who are afflicted with tumors or
female trouble of any kind to give it a faithful trial." â (Signed) Mrs.
E. F. Hayes, 252 Dudley St., (Roxbury) Boston, Mass.
Mountains of gold could not purchase such testimonyâ or take
the place of the health and happiness which Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound brought to Mrs. Hayes.
Such testimony should be accepted by all women as convincing
evidence that Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound stands
without a peer as a remedy for all the distressing ills of women ; all
ovarian troubles; tumors; inflammations; ulceration, falling and dis-
placements of the womb; backache; irregular, suppressed or painful
menstruation. Surely the volume and character of the testimonial let-
ters we are daily printing in the newspapers can leave no room for doubt
Mrs. Hayes at her above address will gladly answer any letters
which sick women may write for fuller information about her illness.
Her gratitude to Mrs. Pinkham and Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound is so genuine and heartfelt that she thinks no trouble is too
great for her to take in return for her health and happiness.
Truly is it said that it is Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound that is curing so many women, and no other medicine ; don't for-
get this when some druggist wants to sell you something else.
