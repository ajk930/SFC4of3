Settlement.
LONDON, Oct. 10.â "Profoundly impor

English-speaking race, but also from the
standpoint of the world's peace." .
This is the comment of John W. Foster,
agent for the United States, in an inter
view to-day on the success of the Alaska
Boundary Commission In adjusting the
principal dispute between Canada 1 and the
United States. -
"When the Canadians receive the , full

than is indicated by the press forecast.
They already possessed an outlet Â¦ to the

It. is said , that, in . all probability, a
period of one year will be required to
complete the work of delimitation on the
boundary line provided In the treaty. The
commissioners could only lay down gen
eral principles for the fixation of the line,
but they could not, in the nature of the
case, undertake to" make a practical sur
vey. This work will be done by experts
named by both the United States and
Great Britain, and steps to this end will
be taken at once.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 19.â An apparent
conflict in the information from London
and the announcement made by a State
Department official on Saturday respect
ing the agreement reached by , the
Alaskan , Boundary Commissioners is ex
plained here to-day ; by the statement
that the London advices touching the
victory of the American case on all points
except as to the Portland canal are per
fectly correct," but that the commission's
decision was not technically final because
of the. omission, to. locate the "mountain
range.",which was referred to in the orig
inal Russian -treaty of cession as a con
ditional limit to the American claim. It
is said, however, at the State Department
that . this is â¢ not, after all, material, in
view of the commission's decision that
every inch of the shore line north of the
Portland canal is American territory, for
whether, the strip be only a mile wide or
ten miles, or forty, the Canadians cannot
reach the sea without crossing American
territory.

"The United States Attorney, not having

finality. Aylesworth and Jett carried
their outspoken disapproval of the deci
sion to the point of refusing to sign even
that section of the decision giving the
Portland Canal to Canada and they em
phasized their attitude by walking out
of the Cabinet room in the Foreign Of
fice before the signatures of the others
had been affixed to the historic docu
ment, which has already been printed
and is ready for the session to be held
to-morrow. The only thing remaining to
be done at this session is that the major

which minutely determines the course of
the boundary in ' accordance with the
American contentions in question No. 6.
An engrossed copy of the decision also
will be signed on Tuesday. -
The refusal of Messrs. Aylesworth and
Jett to coincide In Lord Alverstone's
view was known to only a few persons
here to-night, but at the Foreign Oflice
and in high Government circles it- has
created a painful impression. . There j is
no hope expressed that the Canadian
commissioners will reconsider their â¢ atti

CHEFU. Oct. 19.â The Russians are in

ment for concluding a treaty with China
for the opening of Moukden to the com
merce of the world. They say the St.
Petersburg Government will protest, and
they maintain that the opening of this
new treaty port will never take place./
The Port Arthur Russian newspaper,
Novoe Krai, published a violent article
on this subject yesterday. In another
'article published' to-day it declared that
the Moukden treaty was proof of the ag
gressive nature of the policy of the Uni
ted States. This policy infringed the
rights of Russia, founded on her restora
tion of order in Manchuria and the ces
sion b'y China to Russia of the sole com
mercial exploitation of Manchuria.

"While at Port Arthur, although . that
is not a commercial port, I saw two
steamers unloading, one a cargo of Amer
ican beer, and the other a cargo of Amer
ican flour. My observations led me to the
conclusion that . the Imports of Russia
were largely composed of vodka, the na
tive drink. Russia is not a manufactur
ing country and the Russians therefore
receive their manufactured products very
largely from other nations. The Russians
with whom I talked expressed themselves
as very favorable to American commer
cial enterprises."
that, by the expenditure of $300,000,000 In
the construction of the Siberian Railway
and cities and the suppression of the
Manchurian bandits, who had. formerly
made It impossible for the people to mar

of Manchuria and has thereby made pos
sible an extensive, growing trade, 75 per
cent of which now comes from the United
States. This shows that Manchuria is a
splendid and growing field for American
commerce.

French and Japanese, as well as Brit

of a disappearance of every danger to the

which eo long blocked the way to a set

'"Naturally, the British war office is

Eastern Situation.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.. Oct. 19.â
Hon. Horace -N. Allen. United States Min
ister to Korea, who has be > en in that coun
try for eighteen years and who is en
route to the Orient, spent the day In
Colorado Springs. He left Seoul last
spring, crossed Russia by the Trans-Si
berian Railway and spent the summer in
Europe and the United States. Regarding
the politiclal situation in the Far East,
Allen said:
"So far as the negotiations that are now
being carried on by Russia, China and
Japan are concerned, I, of course, do not
care to be quoted. Our position is that
of a neutral friend to each, and they all
feel very friendly toward the United
States. However the problem may, be 1 de
cided, it seems that It will not be to the
disadvantage of America/Many of the
telegrams we see in the newspapers here
show unmistakable signs of inaccuracy
and sensationalism in dealing with the
present Oriental situation and it is a good
plan to await confirmation before forming
conclusions upon them.
"Korea is regarded as the storm center
of Asia It has been under the afternate
domination of China, Russia and Japan.
Since Japan waged a successful war with
China to secure the, absolute independence
of Korea, China has been left out of the
count and the strife for supremacy has
been between Russia and Japan.
"During the. year past Russia has be
gun to operate a timber concession, , said
to embrace most of the -northern frontier
of Korea, In the operation of this conces
sion the Russian concessionaries are run
ning counter to the interests of certain
Japanese, who "held similar, agreements
with local magistrates. It Is thought that
this condition may lead to serious conse
quences.
"As to the port of Masampho, on the
south coast of Korea, near Japan, which
has been a bone of contention between
Russia and Japan for some time, it is
true that Russia has obtained from Korea*
\he allotment of ground for a special
Russian settlement . and coaling station,
but this was offset and pratically nullified
later by a similar allotment granted to
Japan. Any attempt of either power to
occupy these settlements in a military
way; would doubtless lead to serious dif

at once demanded 50,000 additional troops.
YOKOHAMA, Oct.' 19.â The negotiations
between Russia and Japan have come to
another standstill. It is thought doubt
ful that Marquis Ito!s view of the mili
tary occupation of Manchuria is indorsed
by the whole country, but it is 'believed
that it is strong enough to carry his

here that Russia purposes to hold all she
has gained in Manchuria and refrain from

The passengers of the disabled vessel

As quickly as possible after the collis

smashed Into the side of the steamer St.
Helena as the latter was proceeding on
her run from Napa to the metropolis.
The collision occurred in the channel
opposite Vallejo. A great hole was torn
in the St. Helena and water poured in
alarming volume Into her hold. The few
passengers aboard, most of whom had
retired, were panic-stricken, as were also
the greater number on the General Fris

Cashier J. C. Colcord was soon on the
ground and entered "The bank building at
the side door, wnen the worklne plan of
the safe wreckers was disclosed. They
had laboriously cut an opening through
the brick wall by which they gained ac
cess to the safe. Evidences of a terrific
bombardment were at hand. Great pieces
Â¦of steel had been wrenched loose and
hurled against the vault door, bursting
it open. But the safe, a steel chest, re
sisted all the attempts of the burglars and
the funds of the bank were untouched.
Nine charges were exploded, all in the
course of a half hour.
While the bombardment of the chest
was In progress two men stood guard on
the outside, one on the northeast corner
and one on the south. The guards effect
ually intimidated those living in the Im
mediate vicinity of the bank, who feared
to eive the alarm.

at the Newberg Hotel, was somewhat be
lated in getting in and came along the
street at the tlsn* the work was going

his direction. Vinson got out and notified
the people at the hotel.
RESULT OF BOMBARDMENT.
Austin climbed up into the tower and
clanged the bell and shot by turns until
he had the town thoroughly aroused.
Nothing was heard at the bank after the
first bell tap. In fact, it is believed that
the burglars gave up in despair of forcing
the safe open and left some fifteen min
utes before the bell rang.
City Marshal J. J. Woods tracked thÂ»
men out north of town, across the rail
road, and found where their horses had
been hitched a short distance beyond.
Arthur Austin was the first to give the
general alarm. Having heard the shoot
ing, he started out and soon learned thÂ©
facts. With gun in hand, he made his
way to the City Hall to ring the fire bell,
but found th.it the robbers had taken a
precaution here, too, by cutting away the
bell rope.
At 3 o'clock the citizens of the town
generally were awakened by a series of
muffled explosions, a vigorous ringing of
the town fire bell and occasionally rifle
reports. Almost to a man they turned
out to see what was the cause of the
disturbance, fearing tnat their homes
were in danger of fire. It was soon
learned that robbers had taken posses
sion of the bank and the populace turned
its attention in that direction. By the
time the peopleTeached the scene, how

Belated residents returning to their

the penalty of death and, cowed into sub

bandits.
Persons in the immediate vicinity of the

since shortly after midnight, but. cov

not eive the alarm. Occupants of the
bank building were compelled to remain

NEWBERG, Or.. Oct. 19.-For two
hours this morning, while everything was
shrouded in darkness, this town was prac
tically under the control of a gang of
bandits who were attempting to blow up
the bank of Newberg and loot the vault
of the $10,000 it contained. Charge after
charge of dynamite was exploded against
the safe by the robbers, while those citi
zens who attempted to investicate the
cause of the tumult were held at bay and
even forced to lie down In the streets
by other desperadoes armed with rifles.
Though the brick building of the bank
was badly wrecked, the steel safe with

gave up the attempt and escaped on
horseback.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
. "The difficulties of the Maryland Trust
Company ; have no' relationship, to ours.
Neither our, firm nor Mr. Williams owes
a dollar to the j Maryland Trust Company,
nor does that company owe us anything."
Among the alarming rumors afloat was
one to the effect that the' municipality
of Baltimore had ' milions of its treasure;
realized from, the Western Maryland
Railroad/involved in to-day's failures.
Investigation â¢ proved, however, and : the
There have' been other financial
troubles, in Baltimore recently, involving
first the City Trust and Banking Com
pany and the Hamond Ice Company and
William J. Middendorf & Co., but it is be
lieved they .were not in any manner fore
runners of to-day's suspensions. J. "W".
Middendorf, speaking for. his firm and
J. L. Williams & Sons of Richmond, said
to-day:
The filing of the first applications for
receivers for the embarrassed companies
was followed by petitions for co-receivers
for both companies. The total liabilities
of the two companies exceed $10,000,000.
The cause of the Maryland Trust Com
pany's failure, as set forth in the state
ment of Receiver McLane, was the in
vestment of the assets in Mexican rail
way securities, \ which could, not be
marketed. The Union Trust Company
failed because of a run on its banking
department, about $150,000 having been
withdrawn by depositors to-day, but the
real trouble of the company had its origin
in the organization of the South and
Western Railway in Virginia, in which
a capitalization of about $11,000,000 was
contemplated. l The Union Trust Company
was the fiscal agent for the Virginia en
terprise. Just as the Maryland company
was the fiscal agent for the Mexican
company.
i Though these two failures followed so
closely, it can be said on unquestioned
authority that there was no connection
whatever between the two. The Mary
land. Trust Company and the Union Trust
Company were not Jointly interested in
any. enterprise. Neither company man
aged trust estates.
OTHER FINANCIAL TROUBLES.
CAUSE OF THE FAILURES.
The last statement of the Maryland
Trust Company, Issued on Juno 30, 1903,
showed capital stock of $2,125,000, surplus
of $2,437,500 and undivided profits of $377,-
S98. The conjpany has demand and time
deposits amounting to $5,773,817.
The Union Trust Company, at the close
of business on March 31, 1903, had capital
stock of $1,000,000, surplus of $250,000 and
undivided profits of $159,4S7. The Union
Trust Company had deposits amounting
to nearly $2,000,000.
"It all depends upon how the people of
Baltimore act. If they do not lose their
heads the trouble will blow over in time
and nobody will be hurt; but if they be
come panic-strickerf the consequences will
be serious. This is the time to use calm
Judgment."
Allan McLane, third vice president of
the Maryland Trust Company, was ap
pointed to take charge of the affairs of
that company. Miles White Jr., first vice
president of the Union Trust Company,
was appointed receiver of that institu
tion. McLano gave a bond in the sum of
J2.000.000 and White "gave a bond in the
sum of $1,000,000.
It was agTeed among the leaders, and
so given out for publication, that there
was nothing alarming in the general
financial situation In t^Ss-city. and that
the mere fact that temporary difficulties
overtook one or two concerns was no rea
son why other perfectly solvent institu
tions should be regarded with suspicion.
One of Â» the most prominent bankers in
Baltimore' said:
TRYING TO AVERT PANIC.
BALTIMORE, Oct. 19.â This has been a
day of marked excitement and subdued
anxiety In the financial and business
circles of Baltimore. Luckily a dozen
reports well calculated to provoke a
wholesale run on banks did not reach the
great army of depositors throughout the
city, thus giving: ample -time for conser
vative leaders of business; to allay popu
lar apprehension before It reached dan
gerous proportions.
The day began with the announcement
of the failure of the Maryland Trust Com
pany, and, except to a few, the news
came as a bolt out of a clear sky, spread
ing consternation in all directions. To
these few it was known that the trust
company had long been struggling with
"undigested securities"; that it had sus
tained heavy withdrawals of deposits,
and that, finally, on Saturday last, it had
failed in its efforts to negotiate a two
million dollar loan in London, fj
The suspension of the ' Union Trust
Company, which occurred at a late hour
in the day, gave impetus to many base
less rumors as to other financial institu
tions, which might well have created a
panic had they been current earlier In the
day. " ' " ' " * .

Mayor several Union Labor party candi
dates addressed the assembled voters,
small boys and women. Their speeches
were all alike. Each one vied with the
other In telling his hearers why the Union
Labor party should be supported from top
to bottom. Between speeches the Pierce
Quintet, composed of two male and
three ' female voices, and good voices at
that, ' told in words set to music why
Schmitz was the man. The quintet waa
compelled to answer several encores, the
audience showing a decided preference
for the music. .
When Schmitz entered the hall he was
greeted with cheers." Without any loss
of time/he took his place on the platform,
and Chairman Albert introduced j him as
Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz, "tried and
true, the - champion of , the cause of the
laboring man and the exponent of the
doctrine of equal, rights to -all, special
privileges to none." When the cheering
Mayor Schmitz passed a busy night last
night. He traveled from the Mission to
North Beach, delivering four speeches.
The speech he delivered In the Mission
was delivered at North Beach and at in
termediate points. No one, however, was
any the wiser, except those who followed
him from hall to hall, and these were few.
For his pains the Mayor received consid
erable' applause and not a few cheers"
The heartiest reception was accorded him
at Washington Square Hall, which was
packed to tho doors by men, women and
children. The voters in the crowd wore
Schmitz buttons, and when the candidate
for re-election to the office of Mayor, on
the Union Labor ticket. entered and left
the hall he was greeted with cheers. He
was also interrupted several times during
his speech by the noise of his supporters.

SCHMITZ MEETINGS.
SANTA ROSA, Oct. 19.â Patrick
O*Hara, aged 60 years, ' was shot and In
stantly killed at Guerneville about
midnight Sunday. Coroner Blackburn Im
paneled a jury to-day and that body re
turned a verdict that deceased came to
his death at the hands of deputies In the
performance of their duties.
The details of affairs leading up to the
shooting are enveloped in considerable
mystery. Shortly before midnight Ole
Hansen returned to Guerneville and re
ported that a man was molesting persons
driving along the county road. Justice
of the Peace Brown secured his gun and
started out to make an arrest and en
route called on Elijah Shortridge for as
sistance. O'Hara was occupying a de
serted cabin In Oregon Canyon, some lit
tle distance from Guerneville, and thither
the party went to secure him. There is
a great discrepancy between the stories
told by the witnesses to the tragedy as
to what happened after their arrival.
It is asserted that Shortridge called on
O'Hara to surrender and fired his gun in
the air, but not near him. Hansen and
Bhortridge say that the man was killed
by a shot from the magistrate's weapon,
and this is met with a vehement denial
from Justice: Brown. He declares that he
had no motive whatever that wouia
prompt him to shoot, and asserts that the
man was killed by a shot from tho rear,
where his (Brown's) companions were
standing.' The bullet entered the side be
tween the eleventh and twelfth ribs.
Brown is an aged man, having reached
the four score and ten limit. He has re
sided in Guerneville for, many years, be
ing a pioneer of that' section, and enjoys
the confidence of all who know him.
O'Hara ; was a' stranger in that vicinity,
as are his companions. The deceased is
said to be a San Franciscan. It Is possi
ble some prosecutions may ensue.

Tragedy.
The second meeting was held at Har
mony Hall, 1749 Mission street, where
Lane arrived shortly after 10 o'clock. He
was received by a big crowd and was
cheered as he entered the hall and when
he arose to begin his address/ He had a
good deal to say about the expenditure of
the $18,000,000 bond money during the com
ing two years and wanted his hearers to
understand that the only party who could
put this to the best use was the Demo
cratic party. He waa not In the deal for
himself in any way, but It was only for
the city's good that he took such a vital
interest In this campaign. The emolu
ments of the office were as nothing as
compared with his feelings of loyalty and
subservience to the ' welfare and pro
tection of the interests of the municipal
ity.- He referred to the monarchy of
England and speaking of King Edward
stated that the man who cast an honest
ballot was as great as any king.
Other speakers were John Barnett, John
Connor. Judge Cabanlss, A. H. Wehe, P.
J. Curtis, J. F. Loughery, Dr. Inland, M.

District at Rolando's Hall. Twenty-eighth
and Church streets. He started his speech
by saying that the fight in this campaign
was not In any way. for personal
aggrandisement; he was simply in It to
try to help the best Interests of the "city
and the City's government.* He said: "I
fight now, as always, for what I think is
right." He added that the Republican
party was divided into two factions, the
De Young business men faction and the
Abe Ruef Labor. Union faction. He de
clared the Labor Union party was, under
the present management, simply a band
of masaueraders.
He then roasted the Civil Service Com
mission, his remarks upon this subject
meeting with great approval from his
auditors.
He said he wanted to see that his fel
low citizens would follow a course that
would commend itself to them and to the
citizens for years to come. The future
welfare of the city all rested on the pres
ent election he said. â¢ ,
LAW OFFIGERS
KILL STRANGER
In speaking of Lane, he said that he
did not think that that gentleman could
take any better care of- the charter than
had been bestowed upon It during the last
nineteen months. He did not think, he
said, that because Mr. Lane was a law
yer he was any better fitted Inter
pret the charter than himself -and the
men who had served with him during his
administration. Schmitz also announced
himself as a stanch supporter of the
new San Francisco, made possible by the
recent bond election. His peroration was
an 'appeal to the voters to stand by the
administration of the last two years.
"Why should you change?" he asked.
"You now have something that you know
to be good. Do not change it for some
thing that you know nothing of."
Schmitz' next address was delivered at
Silk's Hall, corner of Preclta avenue and
Mission street. J. A. Devoto was chair
man of the meeting. It was well attend
ed and the listeners to the speeches of
the various candidates were liberal with
their applause. Schmitz received a very
warm welcome and . three hearty cheers
when he got through talking.
John McKeon presided over the meet-
Ing at Twin. Peaks Hall, where was gath
ered the next assemblage addressed by
Schmitz. The hall was pretty well filled
with small boys and voters. The boys
made most of the noise, and the services
of two policemen were required to subdue
them. At. this meeting the Pierce Quin
tet sang several songs, while the crowd
was waiting for Schmitz to appear. The
Mayor did not arrive until after 10
o'clock. He delivered his stereotyped
address and then excused himself from
talking any longer, saying that he had
another meeting to attend. He was
given three hearty cheers â¢ and left the
hall. Nearly every one in the place left
at the same time, notwithstanding that
the chairman announced that there were
several more candidates to be heard from-
At Washington Square Hall the Mayor
waa greeted by an Immense crowd. It
was an enthusiastic gathering. It was
presided over by Joseph V. Ducolng. Once

night he was given three cheers and a
tiger as a farewell.
had subsided, Schmitz thanked the audi
ence for Its very, enthusiastic reception.
He decried what he was pleased to call
the mud-slinglng tactics adopted by. his
opponents, and said that he did not be
lieve in such a method. Following upon
the heels of this he said he did not see
how any laboring man could vote for a
man who thought so little of the working
man's Intelligence that he imagined he
could buy them for a few barrels of
steam beer. He said that Crocker thought
he" could win his way to the hearts of
the voters by supplying them liberally
with the foamy beverage, and he called
upon his hearers to show that they were
not to be so bought.

At one time about a year &za we were try
ins to unionise a certain company and we
wanted to have Schmitz talk to the men to ask

pointed a committee of three to visit Mayor
Schmitz, and Mr. Cooney volunteered to bring
the committee to Schmitz. He first ; brought
them to Parry, the Fire Commissioner, then to
Abe Ruef and finally got Ruef to take them to

Mr. Cooney stated that it was settled by
Charles Spear, â¢' president of the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners. - "
When the strike was settled Harry Worth
ington, president of the Linemen's Union, In
formed the union that the strike, waa settled
by a prominent business man, but would not
own up to the man beinr Crocker, as he did
not want Crocker to get the credit for Jt.
The statement he made was borne out
by James McQueeney, a member of the
union. The latter said he did not know
until that evening that it was Mr.
Crocker who had helped his union and
he wanted to thank him in behalf of fel
low members for the part he took. De
spite his statement, the evening political
organ of Mr. Lane accuses McQueeney of
being a non-union man. In answer to
this charge lir. McQueeney says:
The Bulletin is trying to take credit
away from Henry J. Crocker for the part
he took In settling the linemen's strike.
It will be remembered that at the joint
mcetirtg of the Twenty-eighth and .Twen

about the settlement of the strike, they
would.

CROCKER SETTLES STRIKE.
"I have just arrived in your city and
the first news I received of the failure
of the Maryland Trust Company was
while on the train. I have no fear that
the collapse of that Institution will In any
way affect the enormous banking inter
ests of this country. AH the institutions
have plenty of resources and have long
been prepared for any change in condi
tions. They expected something like the
affair cf to-day and they decided to let
it occur. There is nothing in the condi
tion of the banks of the country to arouse
fear that failures like those of to-day
are going to do general harm."
The consensus of opinion regarding the
'effect of the failures, as expressed by at
least forty of the bankers, when inter
viewed, was clearly voiced In a state
ment made by President F. G. Bigelow
of the First National Bank of Milwaukee,
Â¦who is also vice president of the National
Bankers' Association. Said be:
The news of the failure of thp Mary
land Trust Company and the Union Trust
Company of Baltimore apparently aroused
little concern among the several hun
dred Eastern bankers who were assem
bled In the lobbies cf the Palace and
other local hotels last evening. The ma
jority of them read the dispatches relat
ing to thÂ« closing of the two concerns as
if they had long expected the failures.
In fact, several bankers quietly remarked
that they really had been looking for
ward to the collapse of the first mention
ed Institution and believed that the fail
ure would prove more of a benefit to the
banking interests of the country than a
disaster. .
Eastern Financiers Now in San Fran
cisco Discuss Failures. Â«
BANKERS NOT ALAEMED.
The whole cause cf the embarrassment of
the company !g the fact that it has ioaned
to the Vera Cruz and Pacific Railroad Com
pany in Mexico a very large sum of money,
ts security for which it holds on deposit the
?Ttire issue cf first mortgage bonds ($5,000.-
OOO) preferred etock and $5,000,000 common
stock of that road, and on account of the un
favorable condition of the money market It
has been unable to effect a satisfactory loan
upon these securities.
The Maryland Trust Company has for some
time been able to gn along without ecrlou*
?-mbarrafsment in spite of having so much of
Its money tied up in the Vera Cruz and Pa
cific Railroad and would undoubtedly have
l^en able to wait a still longer time for a
li.Â»an on or sale of thoÂ«e securities wÂ»re It not
for the fact that I find it has a large line of
demand deposits subject to Klthdrawa] on call
and that during the past week two 1 rpe with
drawals were made upon it. This rendered it
absolutely necessary, for the conduct of thÂ«
husint'fe upon an honorable ba^ls. to obtain a
temporary loan upon certain of the Investments
owned by the company. This latter loan was
in process of negotiation with prospects of a
favorable result when, on Saturday last, the
third vice president who, owing to illness 8nd
absence for the past Â«lx weeks of the presi
dent and first vice president, had been com
pelled to take up the entire management of thÂ»
company, discovereft that the obtaining of such
t- loan was merely temporizing; that the ob
taining of such a temporary loan, when taken
In consideration with the proposed loan on the
Yera Cruz and Pacific securities, fell far short
of enabling the company to continue to conduct
business upon an honorable basis; in rhort,
that to obtain the temporary loan in question
Â¦was only putting off the evil day upon the
chance of effecting a. sale of the Vera Cruz
end Pacific road in order to make Itself abso
lutely eoH-ent.
In view of this condition of affairs. I went
to Xew York on Saturday night and withdrew
the application for the temporary loan and
called togethÂ»r the members of the executive
committee who could be reached to meet me
Funday night upon my return from New York,
at which meeting I laid before them the situ
ation of the company discovered by me tor
the nn>t time the day previous, and told them
that in my opinion we could not run the risk
of waiting until Tuesday for action by the
director* at their <juarterly meeting, as should
large withdrawals take place on Monday the
company would manifestly be unable to meet
them, and we would have to suspend.
The committee approved of this view, and
the same evening at the same place, in con
ference with representatives of some of the
largest and most responsible financial institu
tions in the oity who had been invited to meet
there, laid before them the entire state of
the case. After a protracted conference. laet-
Jng Into Monday morning, it was unanimously
decided by all present, with great regret, that
there was nothing to do but follow tho course
rroposed.
At thU time, without a more accurate ex
amination of the book* and exact knowledge
of the various figures, I shall not attempt to
give figures to the press, but will do ro at
the earliest practicable opportunity. In the
meantime, prompt and earnest efforts will be
made to advise with the leading creditors of
thÂ» company with a view to preparing plans
for realizing to the best advantage the various
assets.
finance commissioners have also an
nounced that the city has only $300,000 in

Continued From Page 1, Column 4.
It is known in every political camp
and talked about by every faction* that
Gavin McNab nominated Lane early last
summer. before the. primary elec
tion for delegates t was held, and
it Is -also common knowledge that
Gavin McNab selected the Demo
cratic candidates for Supervisor before
the Democratic com'ention assembled,
and that there is not a man on the Demo
cratic Supervisorial ticket that the cor
porations having business with the board
object to.
Henry J. Crocker's nomination was
made after mature deliberation and In
response to a very, general demand of the
several district delegations that a busi
ness man of energy, integrity and ca
pacity be placed at the head of the ticket.
LANE'S NOMINATION.
Ruef boasts that he carries the Forty
the Forty-fourth District. It is backed
by the Fire Department, the Police De
partment and the advocates of a wide
open town. Liquor dealers that are con
ducting a square, legitimate business are
not in favor of Ruef's scheme to open
wide the doors for everything that comes
along.
When the old Democratic politician of
the lobster species sees his finish in a
political campaign . he begins to shout
.."railroad." The cry is now raised in the
Democratic camp ' that Herrin of the
Southern Pacific brought about the nom
ination of Mr. Crocker. The fact Is fresh
in the minds of the people of San Fran
cisco that the Republican convention
tl.at gave Henry Crocker the nomination
for Mayor was created by 13,306 Republi
can citizens who went to the polls under
the provisions of the primary election
law and voted for the delegates of their
choice. Moreover, Mr. Herrin was abroad
when the election took place and when
the nomination was made.
At the primary election the Democratic
party cast 7443 votes and the Union Labor
party 0066. The Republican vote exceeded
that cast by the Democratic and Union
Labor parties combined. Working men,
property owners and business men went
to the polls at the primary election and
assisted In the creation of an Intelligent
puTJlic spirited convention of representa
tive men, and the ticket nominated by
that convention will be elected because
it is worthy of the support of every good
citizen. .-;â¢>; Â¦>
MACHINE AT WOBK.
Reuf boasts that he carries the Forty
fifth District in his vest pocket, and that
he can deliver the vote of the district to
any party or candidate of his choice,
the same as one might deliver merchan
dipe on contract. The Schmitz forces
also claim the Twenty-ninth, Thirtieth,
Thirty-first, Thirty-second, Thirty-third
and Thirty-sixth districts.
Mr. Crocker will get very nearly the
solid vote of the party whose standard
he bears. The normal Republican vote
of San Francisco approximates 2S.00O. In
addition to his party vote he will derive
considerable strength from Democratic
business men who plainly perceive that
the Democratic nominee has no chance of
success.
It is regarded as extremely doubtful
whether Candidate Lane will be able to
carry a single Assembly district of the
city. It is an even betting proposition
tlmt he will not win one.
The election will take place two weeks
from to-day. Politicians in the several
camps are beginning to figure on prob
able district results. The Republicans
nre absolutely confident that Mr. Crocker
will carry the Thirty-fourth, Thirty-fifth,
Thirty-seventh. Thirty-eighth, Thirty
ninth* Fortieth, Forty-first, Forty-second
and Forty-third districts. The Indica
tions are that the Republican nominee
will win in the Forty-fourth and Twenty
eighth districts. A close contest in each
of these two last named districts is prob
able.
In his favor, and there are no
indications that the current of public
opinion will change during. the next two
weeks. The young men of San Francisco
are enthusiastic supporters of Mr.
Crocker's candidacy, as they regard him
as a fitting type of the progressive young
men of the time.

de la Montanya and J. P. Rice. Tho
members of the club will attend the rat
ification meeting ' at Saratoga Hall to
night. It is expected that the Forty-sec
ond District will roll up a rousing major
ity for Henry J. Crocker, George R. -Wells
and the whole Republican ticket.
At Republican headquarters the most
encouraging reports are received. Not the
slightest doubt of Crocker's election is
entertained. Old campaigners point out
the danger of overconfldence. Big meet
ings are not a sure indication of victory
at the polls.
A GOOD ILIiTJSTEATION.
The fact is recalled that one of the
largest and most enthusiastic political
demonstrations eveT held in California
took place the night before the guberna
torial election of 1898.- The meeting w*s
a Magulre rally. When the. Democrats
saw the multitude and listened to the
cheers for Maguire, they were sure that
the battle was won. -- They <Â¦: went down
town and bet money recklessly on Ma
guire's election. The next day San Fran
cisco gave nearly four thousand majority
for the Republican nominee. , .-...
Big meetings develop enthusiasm, but
organized efforts win victories. The Re
publicans are well organized in every dis
trict of the city. The Republican vote Is
fairly well registered. The harder the
fight between Lane and Schmitz, the
brighter are the prospects of a sweeping
triumph for the Republican cause. If
Schmitz and Lane break even on Novem
ber 3, Crocker's plurality will be about
ten thousand.

FRESNO, Oct. 19.â Stung to madness at
the taunts of a companion who had best

noon whipped out a knife and slashed J.
Walters across the face, inflicting several
deep cuts. The men had played several
games, in which Treasure was each time
the loser, and when they arose from the
table "Walters remarked that his friend
did not know how to play the game.
"With an oath Treasure turned on him
with the open knife In hlj hand and
struck him_ across the fice with it. Be
fore Walters could defend himself Treas
ure struck him several times and was only
stopped from murdering the man by the

Franklin K. Lane addressed two large

IJANE IS WELL BECEIVED.
Speaks to Voters at Harmony, and
Bolando Halls. .
To My Fellow-Unionists and Members of the
Union Labor Party â Fellow-Citizens: Matters
of the utmost Importance compel me to leave
tho -city at this time. I take this means of
impresing upon you the duty of every true
unionist, who has the welfare of the city and
his co-laborers at heart, the necessity of using
every means within your power to further the
success of the Union Labor party.
"With this object In view. I write these few
lines, hoping that In my absence the good
work bo ably begun will continue and will end
in the success of the entire Union Labor ticket.
Yours sincerely.,
"E. E. SCHMITZ, Mayor."
Immediately upon hearing of his intended
departure the committee called at his house
and found that Eugene E. Schmitz had, like
the Arab, "folded his tent and silently stolen
away." Not to be tricked In so outrageous a
manner, the committee hastened to the Oak
land boat. They had prepared and written the
following letter, determined that at least the
Mayor should sign It before he escaped. They
did not find the Mayor until after he was on
the way to Oakland. They then presented him
with the letter and demanded that he should
sign it. which he did, with a very bad grace.
It read as follows: â¢ . . >
"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 16, 1002.
Then upon the platform and In the presence
of the assembled delegates Eugene E. Bchmitz
pledged himself to stand by the party's prin
ciples and to aid it In the approaching cam
paign â Instead of which he later deserted the
party, going East, apparently to do Demo
cratic politics, but in reality because Abe
Ruef feared that the Union Labor party would
be successful, and desired to discredit it.
A very few hours prior to his departure to
the East the campaign committee of the Union
Labor party learned by chance that . Eugene
E. Schmitz intended to abandon the party to
its fate. It was given out by his friends that
his going was imperative, inasmuch as Presi
dent Roosevelt required his attendance as me
diator to aid in settling the coal strike in
Pennsylvania, which, it is needleM to say,
was without the shadow of truth.
A deputation from that club called upon
Eugene E. Schmitz and asked him whether or
not he wished to see the Union Labor party
continue in existence, to which he replied,
evasively, "I do, if there is mich a party."
In. May. 1002. it had become necessary for
the earnest leaders of the Union" Labor party
to take definite action in order to perpetuate
the party. They had organized the Union La
bor Party Central Club to that end. The club
Invited the different unions in the city to send
delegates In proportion to their numerical
strength, with a view to placing their names
on the tickets in their respective districts at
the primary election.
To every meeting of the club Eugene E.
Pchmltz had been Invited, but he had treated
such Invitations with disdain, and It was not
until the Union Labor Party Central Club
had elected its delegates at the primary elec
tion In the year 1902, regardless of the oppo
sition ticket placed in tho field by Schmitx,
Parry and Ruef, that Eugene E. Schmitz, re
alizing his mistake, begged to be Invited to
attend the convention, that he might appear
to be the Union Labor leader atlll. . i>.:
And we say to the Union Labor men of this
city that Eugene E. Schmitz is not entitled to
the support of the Union Labor party for the
reason that he has always considered it merely
an adjunct to the Republican party and cre
ated for his purposes only; and to substantiate
this we say that during the campaign of 1902
Eugene E. Schmitz and Abraham Ruef be
lieved that the Union Labor party should be
retired from politics, at least until such time
as they should require Its assistance, and a
determined effort was made by Eugene E.
Schmitz and Abraham Ruef to prevent the
Union Labor party from placing a ticket in
the field durlne the campaign of 1002. Hav
ing control of the old governing committee of
the Union Labor party, their efforts in that
behalf would have been successful but for the
organization of the' Union Labor Party Cen
tral Club.
We charge you, Eugene K. Schmitz, with
having oppoped the Union Labor party Cen
tral Club, since its very Inception, because
your master, Abe Ruef, feared itls stanch ad
herence to Union Labor party principles, and
was unable to control it..
The Union Labor Central Club is firing
hot shot into the camp of Schmitz and
Ruef. Here is a sample of the club's
bombardment:

The steamer Kerr, -laden with 500* tons
of refrigerated meats from Tacoma for
the Pacific Cold Storage Company, has
not yet reached Eagle. Early in the
month it became apparent that she could
not get through without assistance on ac
count of the low water in the- lower river
and the steamer Lightning was dis
patched to her relief. The Lightning Is
now supposed to be with her, and to
gether they may pull through. More
than 2000 tons of freight remained In the

If these boats fail to get through their
passengers will have to walk hundreds of
miles. Many are not warmly clad and
extreme suffering would result from such
exposure. The mails and several hun

ties Davis and Baker, the prisoner left

necessary to shackle him. He was ac
companied as far as Pacific Junction by
Mrs. Sharp, who was arrested with him.

hours' after the swindler had made his
escape Davis and Baker wandered about
in search of him. Finally- they notified

VANCOUVER, B. C. Oct. 13.-Quons
Yuen, an aged and decrepit Chinese, with
two fellow countrymen, tha latter fairly
wealthy men, were arrested two months
ago for the murder of a fourth Chinese.
Quong was really held as a material wit
ness aealnst tha other two. Now tha
police are sure he has entered into an
agreement to hang in. their stead, in or
der that his widow and family In China
may be well provided for when ho dies.
Quarts at first said that he knew noth
ing about the murder at all. He declared
that he was not even in the neighborhood.
The police believed this story, but con
sidered it necessary to hold him as a wit
ness, s
To-day Quong-, who Is fast nearinx the
end of his life, sent for the police offi
cials and said that he had killed the man
and was willing to hang for it The man
who was murdered was strong and large
and tha officials consider it an impossi
bility that Quong should have actually
killed him with a knife and dragged him
200 yards. Quong declared, however, he
did the deed and expressed great anxiety
to see the other two men cleared.
Similar cases are on record among the
Chinese.

ALAMEDA, Oct. 19.â Drafts of two sub
stitute ordinances granting to the South
ern Pacific Company the local railroad
franchises it , wants were introduced by
Trustee William M. Bowers at the meet
ing of the municipal legislators held to
night, the measures taking the place of
the proposed ordinances that have been On
file with the City Trustees for a month.
The original drafts were withdrawn with
the consent of all of the members of the
governing body of the municipality. The
new ordinance for the south side line
grants the franchise for thirty-four years,
the length of the time which the corpora
tion life of the road has yet to run. In
the franchise for the north side line the
rights are given for twenty-five years, In
stead of the forty-five years asked for by
the 'Southern Pacific Company. In both
outlined ordinances it is stipulated that
no more freight trains shah be operated
over the lines than are being run at pres
ent. "Additional clauses are also embod
ied in the Instruments Introduced to-night
requiring that all tracks and switches for
which the franchises are granted shall be
used within a year, else the privileges will
lapse. Â¦ > .'"â¢â¢:
City Attorney M. W. Simpson, with for
mer City Attorney E. K. Taylor, â¢ will
submit the new ordinances to Manager,
Julius Kruttschnitt of the Southern Pa
cific and report back to the City Trus
tees next ' Monday night whether the
measures are satisfactory to the company
and on what terms the- franchises will
be accepted. : Simpson and Taylor met.
with the City Trustees this morning and
in < the afternoon went to San Francisco
to- confer with Mr.-. Kruttschnitt, but
found -that the latter had not returned
from his Eastern Â¦ trip. At ."the morning
conference Trustee J. F. . Forderer said
he would not vote on the franchise ordi
nances unless the same were first sub
mitted to the voters to pass upon under
the referendum. Trustees Dr. Hi M. Pond,

BERKELEY, Oct. 19.-H. H. â¢ TolT

the Santa Fe Railroad between Berkeley
and Point Richmond, had an experience
at the " hands of two men he believes
were the Nottingham brothers late Sat
urday night on â¢ the San Pablo road.
When he reached' Jones street the men
jumped from cover and with drawn pis
tols stood in front of the horse. One of
them tried to seize the bridle, but belore
he could do it Toffmeyer hit the horse
a sharp blow with "his whip ana it
bounded past the highwaymen.
Toltmeycr crouched down into the bot
tom- of his buggy just in time to escape
a bullet that was sent after him. If the
robbers had succeeded in holding him
they would have been well paid for their
trouble, as he had several hundred dol
lars with him. As the attempted hold-up
occurred some time after the j Point
Richmond hold-ups by the Nottinghams
Toffmeyer believes he was the intended
victim of the same men. He did not re
port his experience to the police.

PITTSBURG, Oct. 19.-J. W. Ellsworth,
president of the Ellsworth Coal Company,
which is accused of importing Welsh
miners to work at Ellsworth, Pa,, accord
ing to dispatches from Washington, wir
ing from Nem York to-night makes an
emphatic denial that either he or his com
pany had made any arrangement with
miners or their agents to that end.
Â¦WASHINGTON. Oct. 19.â Evidence has
been collected by the Bureau of-Immi
gration of a systematic and extensive vio
lation of the contract labor law. Com
missioner General F. P. Sargent has sub
mitted the evidence to the Department of
Justice and has requested the Attorney
General to institute proceedings against
the alleged violators of the law.
The case *n hand involves hundreds of
men, many of whom already are In this
country- Others are en route to the Uni
ted States and are expected to arrive in a
few days. The men are Welsh coal
miners and came to the United States
under alleged agreement to work for the
Ellsworth Coal Company of Ellsworth,
Pa.
PHILADELPHIA, Oc:. 19.-Twenty
elght persons, one of them a woman,
comprise a party of Welsh miners who
are detained in this city on suspicion of
being contract laborers. They arrived on
the steamer Haverford from Liverpool
and were landed to-day. Officers of the
United Mine Workers of America, repre
sentatives of which organization are now
here, are largely responsible for the de
tention of the party.
There la no truth whatever in these reports,
as the bank Is In excellent condition. We have
suffered no material losses and will continue
to do business despite the Stock Exchange.
I understand it 1Â» reported that we lost- heav

explanation given on the floor for the

of their holdings because of their belief
that the next dividend would be passed.
Later Crucible improved to 34. The de

WASHINGTON, Oct. 19.â President Roose
velt's call for Congress to assemble in ex-
traorfilnary session on November 9 will be
Issued to-morrow, immediately after the
regular Cabinet meeting. It will deal with
only one subject, Cuban reciprocity, to
consider which the extra session is called.
The President will point out, as he has
done repeatedly in the past, the necessity
of keeping the nation's obligations to the
island of Cuba by granting reciprocal re
lations In the matter of trade, which will
be of great benefit to Cuba and to busi
ness. The President hopes that favorable
action will be taken without prolonged
discussion and before the opening of the
regular session.
It is practically settled that only the
topic of Cuban reciprocity will come up
for consideration In the House, but It Is
altogether probable that the commercial
treaty with China will be submitted to the
Senate before the. end. of the extra ses
sion. -Â»Â»-Â»..
Â¦When Cuban reciprocity comes up tariff
arguments by the minority party are
probable and representatives of the Amer
ican Protective Tariff League are likely
to be again in evidence, opposing the reci
procity scheme.

McKay leaves a vast estate, estimated
nt J25.0OO.OO0, and he had two relatives-
Mrs. Dexter and Miss Catherine Dexter
of Boston. It is understood the bulk of
his estate will go to Harvard College.
McKay compelled every man, woman
and child who wore American shoes to
pay tribute to him. It was only a small
bit of tax. from H cent to 4 cents a pair,
but it enabled him to live in the most
luxurious style of modern millionaires,
give liberally to educational institutions
and make princely gifts to friends.
McKay had fine residences in Pittsfield,
Cambridge and Boston and a magnificent
mansion in Washington, to which he took
a young bride. Miss Treat, on whom he
lavished every luxury that money could
purchase. After she obtained a divorce
from him he continued to give her $23.(M0
a year for spending money and to send
her costly fruits and flowers. When she
finally married Baron Adolf von Bruen
lng he sent her a check of such munifi
cence that it became the gossip of the
world.
Inventions by McKay revolutionized the
boot and shoe industry of the world.
They shut the doors of the little cobbler
shop, with Its solitary bench, Its hand
ful of pegs and its waxed end, and open
ed the big factories run by machinery,
where great processions of skilled labor
ers wound in and out twice a day.
McKay peddled the stock of his first
corporation from door to door among his
friends and acquaintances In the Berk
shire town of Pittsfleld, where he was
born in 1S21, among the cotton works of
Lowell and Lawrence, where he had man
aged machine shops, and among the whal

the whole matter Involved In McCarren's
resolution be referred to a ccmmltua of

to report Its recommendations to the
county committee as to the best means of
bringing about harmony of action on the
part of the organizations of the various
Assembly districts. This substitute was
carried by the adherents of McLaughUn
by a standing vote of US to 141.
But slight hopes are entertained that

Detectives Taylor,; Ryan and Graham
are positive that Nottingham and his
brother committed the several robberies
in saloons In this* city. Their descriptions
tally with those given by the victims of
the robbers and the manner of work in
all cases on both sides of the bay is the
same. In his pockets were found news
paper clippings of all these crimes. The
Oakland authorities - also say that the
brothers are responsible for many crimes
In that city and crimes committed in
other places are attributed to them.
There will be no effort, made, however,
to .try" Walter Nottingham for crimes
committed in this city until after the

It appears that all who knew Notting
ham feared him. His brother expressed
fear. for him, and Mrs. Nelson says she
never felt secure. It was found by the
detectives that the man had on many oc
casions threatened the woman's life. He
spoke of taking her with him when he
went, and also of taking a couple of po
licemen.
No signs of insanity, however, were
manifest to those who were employed with
him and his oast career was unknown
to all save his associates, as he traveled
under the name of Wells. He was 31
years of age and his home was in Wal
nut Creek, where his , father, C. B. Not

Deputy Sheriffs Maitoza and Lindley
were called and took up the chase in a

University avenues they met the brothers,
â¢and, knowing them, addressed them.
Neither of the deputies was then aware
that they were talking to the highway
men, but after . a short . . conversation
George Nottingham suddenly pulled two
revolvers from his pocket and commenced
firing. The two brothers ran down-Uni

after them. When the four revolvers en

men jumped into the bushes and disap-
BATTLE WITH DEPUTIES.
WITH detectives close upon
him, George Nottingham, alias
William Wells, ex-convlct and
highwayman, ended his life
with bullets early yesterday
morning. As the scene of his suicide the
man of crime chose the bedside of his
divorced wife, for the love of whom he
committed hi% first felony and for whom
that love has been enduring through years
of disgrace and penal servitude. When
the police arrived at his house they found
a letter to the Coroner beside his body
that exonerated his brother in the offense
for which they wanted him and told in
simple language of his dissipation and
crime and desire to relieve them of their
duty.
Nottingham's career as a criminal has
been one of desperation. He undertook
the most daring work and fought for life
when pursued. That he gave himself to
death without taking other lives Is a
mystery to those who knew him. Now,
as he lies in the Morgue, he has beÂ«n de
serted by former friends and even the
members of his own family have turned
against him. In Martinez, where he was
wanted for a robbery, his mother visited
police headquarters and expressed her
bitterness for him. She forbade that the
body be sent home and expressed the
wish that he had killed himself ten years
ago. ; I
STORY OF THE CRIME. >i.'J
The crime for which the suicide was
hunted was the robbery of a saloon con
taining five men at Point Richmond last
Saturday night. His brother, Walter,
assisted him in the deed, and when they
were pursued and overtaken they bat
tled with deputy sheriffs until the re
volvers of the entire party had been
emptied. The fugitives again fled, but
Walter was captured Sunday morning
and made a confession. It was when
George learned that the sleuths were
aware of his presence in this city and
that he would soon be returned to prison
that he decided to end his existence.
While the Point Richmond affair was

were wanted, several other bold crimes
have been credited to them to-day by the
police of three counties. It Is said that
the pair was responsible for the last three
daring saloon holdups in this city, and
they are also accused of repeating this
performance In Oakland a few nights ago
and of holding up a train near Berkeley.
Last Saturday night Nottingham and
his brother left this city on the 8' o'clock
boat and went to Point Richmond. They
rode as far as the second , station and
entered the Manhattan Hotel, their faces
concealed by masks. "With drawn re
volvers they ordered the proprietor and
four other men in the place to throw up
their hands, and when this request was
complied with, Walter went through the
victims' pockets and the cash register
and took about $200. The thieves then de
parted and started off in the direction
of West Berkeley.
On 8eptembÂ«r 4, 1895, Nottingham was sent

every morning. This morning he entered earlier

he made some evasive reply. We had spoken
but a word or two, , when he suddenly threw
himself on the bed beside me, and. kissing me

Sheriff Veale of Contra Costa County
then took up the chase. He came to this
city Sunday night and secured the ser
vices . of Detectives Charles Taylor,
Thomas Ryan and Robert Graham. The
officers were in possession of the name of
Nottingham's divorced wife's father and
started to find him in the hope of locating
their man there.
The name was Thomas Scott and they
believed he resided in the Mission. The
sleuths visited many residences and, after
working all night, came upon a barber
shop at 757 Howard street, where the
woman, now Mrs. Frank Nelson, was em
ployed. They had learned that the for
mer wife was a barber and searched
barber-shops until they came upon this
one conducted by a Mrs. Dunnigan.
There they gleaned all the information
they desired of the criminal's relations
with his divorced spouse; also that he
was In the habit of spending much time
at her house. Just as the detectives
were ready to depart the telephone bell
rang and a message came to the proprie
tress that Nottingham had committed
suicide.
The quartet of man-hunters then . hur
ried to the Scott residence at,102A Noe
street They found their man dead and
the Coroner's deputies In charge of the
body. It was not known who the de
ceased was, as he had traveled under the
alias of George Wells and the case '.was
put down as one without any extraordin
ary features. As Veale entered, how
ever, Mrs. Nelson rushed to him and
cried that the game was up and that the
dead man was the person he wanted. Not
tingham was smooth shaven when he
took his life, he having removed his mus
tache to make escape easier. The story
of the tragedy as told by Mrs. Nelson

around and given consent to everything I have
wanted sojfar.j and,;, as for leaving home, I
knew and he knew that to remain in San Fran

could not stand that climate, and felt It he

be better. Now, Georgle, try to understand
how It would be to be placed in my position.

The accident was caused by the giving

used as one of the guys to support the
big crane. This cable was tested to bear
a strain of 100 tons, and It Is said that
It did not break, but' pulled loose from Its
fastenings.

were lifted from the barge also cot off

Deputy Coroner L. C. Huchel believes

There is still hope for dueling German students

ONE of the most serious phases of: the mu
nicipal contest arises out of the power which
the charter invests in the Mayor and in the
various boards and commissions appointed by him to
carry out his will in the city government. The pow
ers given these bodies arc so varied and so far reach
ing that they directly affect the business interests of
thousands of people. In the hands of unscrupulous
men such powers can be readily turned to evil pur
poses, and accordingly it is not at all impossible that
if an unscrupulous man should hold the Mayor's of
fice for two successive terms, so that he would have
the appointment of all members of the different
boards and commissions, he would build up a political
machine more formidable than any now existing in
the United States.
The power of such an administrative machine would
be far greater than the conservative citizen supposes.
Through one board or another the Mayor, seeking
domination for selfish B ur PÂ° s es, could control the
Police Department, the Fire Department, the School
Department, all persons employed in the department
of Public Works, the saloons of the city and all per
sons engaged in occupations requiring licenses. - la

TBIES TO STOP FIBE
AND IS FATALLY BUBNED
This rounds *ell. but behind it is the fact that the
railroad was forced across Manchuria under cover of
the Boxer troubles, and the affair had in it none
of ibfi elements of free consent by which China could
have permitted another Government, as a public and
not private enterprise, to build a railway on her soil.
When Russia procured the departure from China of
the armies of the other Western powers by a specific
promise to withdraw her own, and when she from
time to time renewed that promise after its violation,
:-he knew as well as she knows now her purpose and
intentions in Manchuria. If the other nations did
not seriously expect her to withdraw from Manchuria
on October 8 it was because her faith had been so
often broken that no one expected her to keep it.
The immunity that she enjoyed, and the fruit of her
broken promise, were at once employed, with unusual
effrontery, in making demonstrations intended to de
stroy the independence of Korea, thereby threatening
the existence of Japan.
Her present attitude, exploited in the last delivery
of Count Cassini, is due solely to the vigorous stand
taken by the Government of the Mikado. If the pro
posals secured by the British Minister, Sir Charles
Macdonald. are accepted by Russia, and her sphere
of influence is thereby delimited, the world has no
guarantee that her faith, pledged to the new arrange
ment, will be any better kept than the promise to
evacuate solemnly given to the concerted nations at
Peking. Russia's word has ceased to be good for
anything, and if Japan be wise she will continue to
strÂ«ngthen her navy and to gird herself for a struggle
â¢with Adam Zad.
I\ is one reassuring sign that the representative of
Great Britain has intervened to establish an under
standing. This he could not have done without the
consent of his Government, and maybe^he has acted
by its instruction, which would mean a British and not
a Japanese initiative. His presence in the matter is
a sort of assurance that the British-Japanese treaty of
umity and alliance is considered to be something
stronger than a bond of courtesy between the two
nations, and that Great Britain does not intend to
leave her ally to bear the shock alone when it comes.
It is a strange and rather romant : r feature of the
affair that Japan, limited in territory and population,
stands between Russia and all Continental Europe, re
sisting the design of the Czar to make future civiliza
tion conform to the Cossack model and to put his
foot on the neck of the world. There seems good
reason why Russia should at present accept the pro
posals framed by Sir Claude Macdonald, and there
also seems no reason why she should keep her prom
ise to observe them. In such a case the rest of the
world may well consider its duty to back Japan in
her determination to keep Russia out of Korea and to
secure the future progress of China as an independent
empire. This will arrest the growth of the northern
glacier, and perhaps confine it*within bounds which
-will leave room enough for the other races to live.
Japan has, in this affair, fully emerged from her isola
tion, and rter courage and diplomacy place her in the
proyp of world powers which have obligations to each
other that must be acknowledged.
IT now appears probable that peace may be secured
between Russia and Japan. The British Minister
to Tokio has obtained Japan's consent io a list of
pioposils to Russia by which Manchuria is to be re
:-toied to China and the principal towns of that prov
ince are to be opened to trade and all troops arc to
be withdrawn except the guard of the railways. Rus
sia is also to renounce her timber concessions on
both sides the Yalu River and her assumed rights in
Vongampho, and concede that the country south of
the Yalu is within Japan's sphere of influence.
Count Cassir.i, the Russian Minister to the United
States, who is in Paris, is quoted as saying that Rus
sia does not intend to annex Manchuria, but, hav
ing built the railroad and incurred enormous expense
there, she intends to safeguard her rights and realize
legitimate benefits. He adds that this was so "well
understood that none of the powers except Japan se
riously insisted that she evacuate Manchuria on Oc
tober 8.
PROSPECT OF PEACE
A SPECIAL edition of the Napa Register has
been issued which is devoted largely to a de
scription of Napa County. The area of the
county is 8oo square miles, or 512,000 acres. The as
sessed lands amount to 404,704 acres. The total as
sessed valuation, including the railroad, exceeds
$13,000,000. The population of the county is 18,000;
of the city of Napa 5000. The State and county tax
outside of incorporated towns is $1 72 on the $100.
Mentioning particulars the Register alludes to the
employment of factory employes in the city of Napa.
Five hundred persons are earning wages in manufac
turing establishments all the year. When the driers
and canneries are caring for the fruit crop at least
500 more employes are enrolled as wage-earners.
Napa maintains a Board of Trade, the duty of which
is to encourage men of business and also home-seek
ers to locate in Napa.
In the past few years the dairying industry in the
Napa Valley is reported by the Register to have
grown to large proportions. The culture of the olive
is found to be profitable. Nut-bearing trees are on the
increase, and almonds and English walnuts are sure
and profitable crops.* Citrus fruits are grown, but
more profit is to be found in stone fruits. "There are
many localities in California," says the Register, "that
are becoming known as the 'home of the peach' or the
'home of the prune,' but Napa Valley is the home of
all good things horticultural."
Viticulture is one of the leading industries of the
county. Some of the finest wine cellars in the world
are there. Many underground cellars are tunneled
into the hills for aging wines. - They are visited by
sightseers. Stock farms are on a large scale, and are
noted for thoroughbreds. The manufactures are men
tioned collectively by the Register: "Napa has begun
to reach out as a manufacturing center and stands
upon a par with many cities of much greater preten
sions. Within her limits are located representative
and prosperous establishments, and among them are
two tanneries (in which are made glove, shoe, har
ness and sole leather), a glove factory, shoe factory,
shirt factory, box factory, hat and cap factory, four
cigar factories, planing mill, fruit driers, cannery, dis
tilleries and wineries. Nearness to San Francisco,
the best shipping facilities by rail and water, make of
Napa a natural manufacturing center, where high
grade help is always in demand."
The causes of prosperity and accessories to growth
have been provided mainly by local capitalists. The
people of Napa, in other words, have confidence in
themselves and their facilities. The schools and
churches are numerous. A cement plant has begun'
operations in the county that turns out 2000 barrels in
product daily and pays $20,000 per month in wages.
The city of Napa is forty-six miles north from San
Francisco. The distance is made in a little more
than two hours by rail and in four hours by steam
vessel. The water lines carry freight and passengers
between Napa and San Francisco, and rates are kept
down by rail through water competition. The city, as
viewed by the Register, is found to have improved
more in the past two years than in anytorresponding
period in its history.
"The establishment of cement works near by," says
the Register; "the expansion of our factory interest;
the coming of an electric road and the natural growth
attendant upon healthy agricultural and commercial
conditionsâ all these things contribute to the making
of Napa what it is and what it must ever be â one of
the foremost of California's interior cities."

In the northern part of the State recently a man
aged 75 years and a woman four years his junior were

Mr. Wllcomb held the attention of the
guests for an hour, illustrating as he
talked. No more interesting topic could
have been chosen, as basketry is of ab
sorbing Interest at the present hour, since
it has come to be looked upon as a history
of primitive manâ and Mr. Wileomb knew
his subject as do but faw.
Miss Niggle, a child with a fine voice,
sang two pretty ballads. Violin solos by
Miss Aristine Pixley, a dialogue, "The
Quarrel," by Miss Niggle and Gladys Ra
gan, and readings by Miss Beatrice Peck
completed a most interesting programme.
Miss Peck, who is a stranger to San Fran,
cisco audiences, scored great successes
two years ago In Chicago, and latterly in
Seattle, by her interpretations at social
affairs, and yesterday added fresh laurels
to. her reputation as a drawing-room
reader. Unaffected, charming and chic,
she scored a splendid success.
The programme over, the Daughters
served teaâ such good teaâ to their guests,
who were loth to separate themselves
from Mr. Wilcomb's baskets. Small won
der.
The Daughters of the California Pio
neers were hostesses at a delightful af
fair yesterday afternoon, when they en
tertained about 150 guests in the parlors
of the Pioneers. How the old pioneers do
love to linger about at these affairs and
enjoy the pleasant programmes that are
offeredâ likewise the good tea that is
brewed by Tom, the indispensable.
A talk upon Indian basketry was gtven
by Superintendent Wileomb of the Park
Museum, who brought with him a truck
load of basket treasures. Treasures?
Well, some of these, the feathered Po
mos, are worth $500. "Besides," said the
speaker, "they carry with them more
than a mere commercial value to the
lover of primitive art, for they tell the
tale of race origin. In Africa we find the
self-same designs as we find among the
Hopi and other Arizona tribes." Here Is
a prop to tho Atlantis tale.
The afternoon was further devoted to a
delightful paper by Mrs. C. T. Mills, pres
ident of Mills College. Mrs. W. S. Davis,
chairman of the committee on education,
directed the programme, while Mrs. Os
car Mansfeldt looked after the music,
covering herself with glory. The follow
ing selections were rendered:

The club whose guest ho was yesterday
will attend solidly his two concerts to ba
given this \ week, the first Wednesday
evening and the second on Saturday
afternoon, at Lyric Hall. These promise
to be as "functionary" as the affair of
yesterday, when many stunning gowns,
mostly white, w were seen in the club
rooms. . 'Â¦ y;
This club has rather distinguished itself
in past years by entertaining musical
celebrities. Last year it held a splendid
affair for the great Wflczeh, who, by the
way, has much In common, physically and
menially, with Mr. Spamer, their present
guest. This clever violinist began his
career at the age of 11, when he became
concert master^ of the Hoch Conserva
torium at Frankfort. At 16 he entered
the tutelage of the great Wilhemjâ whom
those of us with good memories recall â
and now, at 20, he is the peer of his great
master. . ..X.'t
And he dresses most sanely, and, what
is rarer still in a great artist, he acts
sanely. And how he does play with that
bow! First you are thrilled with a quiv
ering exaltation as you catch a glimpse^
of the sunshine of a soul; then of a sud
den you go into stygian darkness, where
a soul writhes in despair. This is the
art of that bowstring that sends shivers
down your spine and lures a lump into
your throat. Otto Spamer was honored
by the Sorosls Club, but he repaid his
debt a thousandfold In the music he play
ed to it. And how the hearers drank it
in! The club members and their guests
missed never a note', and their apprecia
tion must have been sweet to the artist.
. The Sorosis Club tendered a reception
yesterday to the great : virtuoso. Otto
Spamer, who during the late Symphony
concerts gave the rarest pleasure to that
part of the discerning public that knows
an artist when it hears one. "Sees one?"
Well, hardly. Otto Spamer doesn't carry
any of the external attributes of the
musical artist, except his violin. He wears
hair at normal length, and all his dis
tinguishing features in the musical line
lie in his brain, rather than in his hair.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 13.-St. Joseph's fair,

Finally he came to the promised story
of revelation. He quoted scripture to
show that Elijah was to come a third
time.
He said the story that hl3 wife lost a
$1300 diamond pin was untrue, as she
never owned a pin like that, nor had she
lost anything. The tales printed about
his people being hungry were also lie. 3 ,
he said. He had "licked" the press of
Chicago, he shouted and he would "lick"
the press of New York. He would Uclc
these "vultures."
"There is nothing so joyful as spending
money for the Lord," he continued.
"They say I came to New York for
money. I don't deny the soft Impeach
ment."
Several times the audience hissed
Dowie. After one such demonstration
he shouted: "We come here and we get
your impudence, but I will get your
hearts and then I will get your pocket
books.
NEW YORK, Oct. 19. -After attending
an early sen-ice In Madison Square Gar
den John Alexander Dowle and "Restora
tion Host" numbering 4000 began to-day a
house-to-house canvass of the city. Be
fore giving them his final instruction?.
Dowle said: .V
"I am Koln* out to do a little restora
tion work myself and I won't be far from
Wall street. Pray for me."
The majority of the audience at the
early service was composed of Zionisms.
No robe? were worn. Dowle preached a
sermon on "The Sin of Idolatry," with ap
plications to present conditions.
A "divine healing meeting" was ne.U in
the garden from 10:30 a. m. to noon, at
which Dowle delivered an address on
"The Opening of the Beautiful Gate of
Divine Healing."
In his address Dowle alluded to some
clergymen as "mean dogs." and others,
whose criticisms of him had been pub
lished in the newspapers, he said wore
"working for the derll." " -'''-Â¦
Of the 3000 or more that were assembled
when the noon meeting: began less than
half remained when Dowle had finished
speaking.
Later Dowie, accompanied by Mrs. Dow
le, his son and Deacon W. P. Kindle,
called on Mayor Low at the City Hall
and told the Mayor that his people had
respect for New York and admired the
Mayor for what he had tione. He thanked
the Mayor for police protection and de
parted with the Zlon salute. "Peace be
unto thee. brother," to which the Mayor
responded, "Thank you. sir."
Twelve companies of the Zlon nest,
numbering several hundred persons each,
were engaged to-day In the house-to
house canvass of the city. Each com
pany was divided into bands of ten. every
band having a captain. To-day they vis
it.d Manhattan only. The arrangements
were under the direction of Elder Abra
ham Lee and Deacon George Mitchell and
the field marshals. Deaconess Jessie Og
den had charge of the house-to-house
canvass In the fashionable district of the
city.
When Dowle opened his night 'meeting
in Madison-square Garden he faced an
Immense throng; when he closed it his
audience had dwindled to only a few
hundred persons besides the "host" he
brought with him from the West. He
fretted, fumed, threatened, cajoled and
finally resorted to the use of epithets,
his hearers meanwhile leaving the meet
ing, several hundred together, drowninsj
the sound of his voice. He had an
nounced that to-night he would tell how
it was revealed to him that he was
"Elijah" and also that he would have
something to say to the newspapers ana
their reporters. His talk was inter
spersed with several hymns. At times
when the tramp of those leaving the hall
was more than his voice ciuid overcome
he devoted himself chiefly to denuncia
tion of tobacco smokers, liquor drinkers
and newspaper men, all of whom he
classed as "dirty dogs" and "dirty
birds."

Three candidates for the office are in the field, but
it is well understood the fight is really between' but
two of them, Henry J. Crocker, the Republican can
didate, who represents the conservatism of the com
munity, and Eugene E. Schmitz, who represents
Abe Ruef and Abe Ruef's ambitions. Another term,
of Schmitz would see the organization of an adminis
trative machine more powerful than Tammany, and
the bosses who arc back of him would have a control
of the interests of so large a class of the people as
to give them an almost tyrannic power in the com
munity. That is a menace that has to be faced when
ever consideration is given to the serious phases of
the campaign. It should be borne in mind by every
voter. Conservative citizens and taxpayers cannot
afford to take chances of two years more of Schmitz
and Ruef.
addition the Department of Public Health has power
to harass every householder and to seriously inter
fere with his enjoyment of his property.
At the time the charter was under consideration
the danger of placing such large powers in the hands
of the Mayor was fully discussed, the advocates of the
plan arguing that the very fact of having such an au
tocratic Mayor would lead to the selection of good
men for the office, since the people would not dare to
elect an unscrupulous man, no: the creature of such
men, to the office. The argument found favor with
the people, the charter was adopted, and now we have
to confront the issue of electing the right man.
Of the enormous variety of production in this win
terless land the bankers will see examples in their
visit to-day to the State Board of Trade. They will
learn that the continuity of crops and harvests is
here unbroken. Every <iay in the year we are gath
ering the products of the soil for market. We are
extending our fields, gardens, vineyards and orchards,
and can respond to any present or future demand for
their products, either from our hinterland in our own
country or from far Asia.
Having observed the basis of what we have done
and of what we will do in the future, we expect the
Eastern bankers hereafter to believe their brethren
from San Francisco when they say with the apostle,
"We come from no mean city."
commerce.
Since California became American territory the
process of opening China to external trade was begun
in earnest. Our commerce with that country had its
beginning in the immigration of Chinese here. It
was, after all, a limited immigration, and during the
whole period that it was free and unrestrained less
than three hundred thousand Chinese came here. But
during the same period millions of Europeans flocked
to the Atlantic seaboard, stocking the Eastern States
with an assimilating population. But small as our
Chinese population was it was sufficient to establish
commercial relation's with that empire and to fix
among us Chinese merchants as factors of our
products who know the wants of their own people,
and Chinese bankers who are probably as expert in
the science of banking as any of the gentlemen in the
American Association of Bankers. The commercial
relations of this city and coast have survived the
strain of excluding Chinese immigration, and we are
still in relations of good understanding with that best
nation of workers in all Asia, in whose expanding
wants we must look for the expansion of our com
merce.
The next commercial opportunity that interests us
is offered by Japan. Yet how recent is the opening
of that empire to trade! The bankers will find here
Japanese commercial houses and banks and news
papers, but less than fifty years ago the Japanese were
unknown to us and we to them. The first Japanese*
ever seen on this coast were a few castaway sailors,
who survived the wreck of a junk and were found by
a hitherbound vessel floating on wreckage in the Pa
cific. We did not know what they were. Had they
been men from Mars they could not have been more
strange to us.
These things illustrate the extreme newness of our
relations to that part of the world, to which we must
look for trade as the East looks to Europe, and what
we have done here must be judged in the light of the
brief perspective of our commerce and finance.
When it is so considered, our visitors will certainly
appreciate the industry with which we have cultivated
our opportunity. At the moment when Thomas H.
Benton, standing on the steps of the Courthouse in
St. Louis, pointed westward and exclaimed, "It is the
East; it is India," much of the territory traversed by
our visitors to come to us was as unknown as to its
topography, geography and resources as the unex
plored parts of Africa are to-day. Yet there are men
still living who heard Benton declare that over that
territory was the road to India.
As these gentlemen explore our land they will be
impressed that they have come into another world,
into a region physically the antipodes and antithesis
of that they know. As they find our weather now,
so thejj would find it in December, January and all
the months between the winter and summer solstice,
unbroken, except by the early rains which give our
January landscape the verdure and flowers of the
Eastern June, and by the latter rains that baptize our
land with the final fertility that assures the harvest to
follow seedtime.
Our financial history is of special interest to them.
During all the suspension of specie payments, in the
Civil War period, when the legal tender quality passed
by law from coin to currency, we maintained gold as
our standard of value, our legal tender and our com
mon currency. It was the only case of the kind in the j
world's history. No use now to discuss its wisdom.
We did it, and it is one of the most stupendous facts
in all the romantic story of finance. Even now they
find gold in circulation everywhere. We mine it in
our ledges and placers, and we coin and handle it,
hoard and invest it, as the common money of the
people. The economic effect is everywhere notice
able. Paying wages in gold eagles induces labor to
be thrifty. It seems such concrete property that a
workingman no more squanders it than his house,
and his surplus earnings, in gold coin, go to the
savings bank or into some interest-bearing invest
ment.
THE meeting of the National Association of
Bankers in San Francisco is the first great
gathering of business men of the Union at a
Pacific Coast point. We have had many national
bodies of benevolent, patribtic and professional or
ganizations, but now come the bankers to transact
the annual business of their association and to look
out upon the Pacific, most of them for the first time
seeing that great ocean across whose waters is to
come a commerce that will equalize the material con
ditions of this coast with those of the Atlantic sea
board, which had centuries the start of us, because
it faces Europe as the source of immigration and

Clyde Fitch's famous comedy drama,
"The Cowboy and the Lady," was pre
sented with great success at the Alcazar
last night. Play and players were ap
plauded without stint by an audience
which crowded the little theater to Its
doors. The author has made a curious
but in this case happy combination of
tragedy and comedy. There Is life and
action in every line of the piece.
The scene Is laid in Colorado. The cow
boy of the title is a Harvard graduate,
who, while in search of a taste of fron
tier life, falls In love with the talented
and beautiful wife of Â«. villainous profli
gate. The latter is murdered by a Jeal
ous halfbreed and the hero Is tried and
convicted on the Btrength of circumstan
tial evidence.
Then there Is a court scene, In which
the Judge Is about to pronounce the death
sentence when the inamorata of the real
murderer attempts to tell the true story
of the crime and 1b shot by the half
breed. It is announced that the woman
is dead and the double murderer con
fesses. The hero and the heroine fall
Into each other's arms and attending cow
boys cheer wildly. Another love affair of
minor Â¦ importance also terminates hap
pily. Thus two romances and two mur
ders can be had for the Bingle price of ad
mission.
James Durkin, as Teddy North, was the
favorite of the audience. He was so
funny most of the time that his bearers
found It difficult to take his occasional
agonizlngs seriously. Adele Block, In the
part of the heroine, was very charming.
She combines talent and beauty. Frances
Starr played the tomboy to perfection.

The Central Theater played one ct Its
strongest melodramatic cards last night
in "Ranch 10." As the name implies, the
piece depicts life on the frontier of the
nation. It furnishes an idea of strenuous
cowboy existence and of the unstrained
quality of Justice that was dealt out In
"wild West" days.
The house was crowded and "Ranch 10"
was enjoyed thoroughly and- enthusias
tically from beginning to end. There Is a
strong fascination about this melodrama,
the interest Is kept keenly alive and there
is not a dull moment In the four acts.
The mystery of the slaying of an Indian
girl, the false accusation and the appeal
to the lynchers; the blowing up of the
stockade, the burning of the ranch
house and the rescue of the heroine from
the flames is the kind of action that in
spires the gallery to "raise the roof." In
the third act there Is a snowstorm scene
that approaches realism about as near as
it is possible behind the footlights.
The closing act is a courtroom scene In
which L. R. Stockwell, in the humorous
character of Judge Prose, keeps the house
in paroxysms of laughter. "Ranch 10" is
cleverly cast. Herschel Mayall has a dual
role, that of the twin brothers, one of
whom, under circumstances of mistaken
identity, is tried for the other's alleged
crime. Mayall's work was superb. Eu
genia Thais Lawton, as the faithful and
self-sacrificing heroine, had the sympathy
of the audience throughout, and Georgie
Woodthorpe gave a clever character lm-
Dersonatlon as the independent old maid
owner of Ranch 10. Myrtle Vane was ex
cellent in the role of the Indian girl, and
Anita Fallon filled the bill ab the woman
from Tlpperary.
Henry Shumer, as the potent political
doctor, was in excellent trim and earned
the applause of the galleries for a change,
while George Webster, as Portuguese Joe.
the villain, was all the ungrateful role
called for and got the benefit of the
hlssfs. George Nicholls and Walter
Whipple made the most of minor parts.
"Ranch 10" is an immense hit, and cur
tain calls and flowers attested how the
strong old border drama captured tEe
house.

The Marcel of Domenico Borghese was as
thoroughly Bohemian as the most exact
ing could wish and the character was
personated with Just enough of swagger
and nonchalance to render It naturally
piquant. Borghese has a fine voice, that
is heard to equally good advantage In
solos and choruses, possessing a rare lyric
quality, mellowness and reserve. Augusto
Dado, the deservedly favorite basso, has
not so much to do In the character of
Colllni as the audience would wish, but
what there was was done well and with
that rounded sweetness In which Dado
excels^ â a quality very rare with the ma

SIgnora Tromben exhibited admirable

Duke was 21 years of age and had been
working at the San Ricardo vineyard
three weeks, having come there from Tu
lare.
Afterward It was discovered he had
broken his back in the fall. His friends
called to him to get away from the burn
ing building, but got no answer, and the
flames were raging too flrecely about him
for them to come to his rescue.* When at
last the body was dragged out of the
heat It was found to be literally cooked to
pieces.
FRESNO, Oct. 19.â James A. Duke, an
engineer employed at the San Rlcardo
vineyard, five miles northeast of this city,
was burned to death this morning in
plain view of a score of fellow workmen,
who were powerless to lend him any aid.
Duke, with eight other employes of the
vineyard, slept in a two-story bunkhouee,
two of the men occupying the lower floor.
At 2:30 o'clock this morning one of the
men below awoke and discovered that
the building was on fire. He gave the
alarm at once, but so rapidly did the
flames spread that the men above barely
had time to get out.
Duke and George Kelly were the last
ones to awaken and when they groped
their way through the smoke to the head
of the stairs they found the stairway a
seething mass of flames and escape by
that means impossible. Kelly ran to the
window and jumped to the earth. He was
already seriously burned, but was unhurt
by the fall and soon crawled to safety.
Duke followed him, but in jumping caught
his foot and tumbled headlong to the
ground, lighting on his back.

Perhaps the best service the "Soldiers
of Fortune" has done so far is the in
troduction here of Robert Edeson and
his company, as capable actor and com
pany as have been seen here for many
days. American comedy need fear no lack
of a leading exponent while Mr. Edeson
is in evidence. Most, perhaps, of Nat
Goodwin Mr. Edeson reminds. There is
the same human, quiet, finished method;
the same delicacy of light and Phade, the
same capacity of pathos, the same lurk
ing drollery. Mr. Edeson presents a hero
in Robert Clay that realizes the best
ideal of Americanism on all sides. He
looks the part admirably; his facial ex
pression is vividly sympathetic, and he
has a most useTul vocal gift. Altogether
the actor is already of the best contem
porary comedians and will be of the
greatest.
Quite as plausible as Mr. Davis' book is
Mr. Thomas" play, and very much Thomas
to boot. The deft, splashing and pictur
esqueâchromo. lithographic quality, if
you likeâ of the playwright's touch is
here In most familiar evidence. With
Robert Clay, American civil engineer, and
hero of a two-penny revolution In South
America, Mr. Thomas goes gunning as
happily as he does with the hero of
"Arizona." in so far as Mr. Davis per
mits. But there are times. Ona of them
is where the hero holds his murdered
friend to his, bosom and makes a long
speech to the foreign gentlemen who have
shot him. white they listen as respectfully
as If they were at an blandian primary.
Curtain. The rise of this curtain (Act III)
to rapturous applause discloses the hero
with his murdered friend tucked in his
arms, mother and child fashion. The
next curtain finds the M. P". thrown over
a table and the next probably dropped
into the icebox, for he has disappeared.
Small inconsistencies like these, how
ever, do not prevent "Soldiers of For
tune" from furnishing a lively evening's
amusement, and the first two acts are
wholly free from them. Author and play
wright both have succeeded in present
ing in the hero a notable type of Ameri
can, clean, gritty, human, capable and
eminently Interesting. Besides him there
are several cleanly drawn types, admir
ably contrasted, and brought Into a series
of situations that keep the attention If
they do not always convince. Indeed, but
for a sometimes too serious touch. Mr.
Thomas has succeeded in getting almost
the charming fantastic atmosphere of
Captain Marshall's delicious farce. "His
Excellency, the Governor." With the ex
ception that the playwright does not in
sist on the love of Clay for the elder Misa
I^angham In ' the first instanceâ whereat
the play loses strengthâ the story is pret
ty closely adhered to. And the lines are
delightful.
Something possibly, probably much, of
the warmth of the reception accorded
to "Soldiers of Fortune" depends on the
temper of the audience, for its sins are
doubtless many. Last night they were
freely forgiven it for the sake of its joy
ful virtues, and because, pardie, the au
dience was in the humor on't.
Thcr? are all sorts of moments but the
dull one in "Soldiers of Fortune," given
for the first time here last night at the
Columbia, the producing person and per
sons being Robert Edeson and an excel
lent company.
Richard Harding Davis, who made the
book, is happy in the collaboration of
Augustus Thomas, who made the play. It
is the kind of thing Mr. Thomas revels
Inâ here positively wallows inâ and the
audience lart night reveled its hardest,
too.

THC ClflTAUW COMMNf, NCW VOHN Ci f r*After Williams reached Chicago both
starters corresponded with Brooks, agree
ing to come here, so Mulr takes it for
granted Williams offered no objection.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19.â J. A. Muir,
who represents the Huntlngton Interests
at Ascot track, said this morning: that
Thomas H. Williams told him the Cali
fornia Jockey Club would offer no objec
tion to any racing dates the local associa
tion might claim, but that no understand
ing was had whereby the club here could
secure the services of Starters Holtman

SAN MATEO, Oct. 19.â In the big la
crosse match game on Clark's polo
grounds in this city to-day, the Van
couver team from British Columbia over
came the Talagoos, champions of Cali
fornia, by a score of 9 to 7. This makes
the Vancouvers the undisputed cham
pions of the Pacific Coast and second
only to the Shamrocks of Montreal.
The victory was well earned, for the
home team was on its mettle and put up
an astonishingly good game. The su
perior training and constant practice of
Vancouver gave them an advantage over
the Talagoos, however, which could not
be overcome until near the close of the
game. The match was so even that it
was impossible to predict the score. Up
to the last quarter. It seemed that a- tie
would result, when Vancouver, on a sud
den spurt, scored two goals and the
game closed with .those two points to
their credit over the tally of their op
ponents. '
When the ball was faced by Suckling
of Vancouver It fell to Parts of the Tala
goos on a draw, who pa*sed it to "M.
Lyons, but it was relieve*, by the Van
couvers, who carried it swiftly to the
opposite goal, where It waft pooled by
Cao of Vanvouver In Just fifty-three sec
onds. It was a brilliant run and won
tremendous applause. Vancouver goaled
twice again In rapid succession, making
the score 3 to 0.- Then the Talagoos woke
up and took four straight goals, the first
by Paris being shot in forty-nine sec
onds and the grand stand went wild.
Succeeding goals were shot by Darrah,
Coutts, M. Lyons, M. J. Lyons and Degan
for the Talagoos; and Godfrey, Mclntler,
Cao, Matheson and Murray for Vancou
ver. It was a fairly good seesaw game
from the seventh to the fourteenth, but
was sufficiently entertaining nevertheless.
The sympathies of the audience were
plainly with the home team, which put
up a gallant defense. Little Coutts of the
home defense did splendid work and Barr
in the same post for Vancouver was not
less skillful, A. E. Suckling of Vancou
ver refereed the game, while Coats and
Wood served as umpires.
It is said that an exhibition game by
the best visiting and local players will
be given here next Sunday on account of
the superior grounds.

The impression of horsemen concerning
the Lynch case was that the- officials of
the track had, as Condon intimated, made
something of a "break" in making the
announcement as they did. Owner Con
don would say nothing of the case that
would implicate any politician in having
exerted a "pull" in behalf of Lynch.
CHICAGO, Oct. 19.â The "certain in
fluences," which, by the admission of the
officials of the Harlem racetrack, were
strong enough to compel the reinstate
ment of "Danny" Lynch, the debarred
horseman, to-day, sealed the lips of race
men and politicians alike. The silence of
evasion characterized the statements of
all concerned. John Condon, owner of the
Harlem track, and Martin Nathanson,
secretary of the Harlem Jockey Club, re
fused to name the politician or politicians
who may have interceded for Lynch. /
It was rumored this afternoon that
Congressman McAndrews held a two
hours' secret interview with Sheriff Bar
rett on Friday prior to the ruling of the
Harlem officials reinstating Lynch, but
Sheriff Barrett expressed ignorance of the
incident. *

Felipe Lugo, an Amigo colt carrying the

year-olds. In the betting his price went
from even money to 3 to 2 and he won
all the way, beating Lady Usk in a gal
lop. Flea finished third.
In the third event Skirmish, the second
choice, was awarded a nose verdict over
the 4 to 3 favorite. Little Margaret. The
former mare made all the running and
See lurnished one of his vigorous finishes.
Lewis on Madam Bishop took the show.
Mary Nance, which was once started at
Oakland as a ringer under the name of
Los Rosas, was a starter in this race.
Fluce actually was no favorite for the
fourth event, anything having a chance
being listed at 2 to 1. Loyal S, ridden
by Powell, passed Meteora and Nellie
May. in the stretch, scoring hands down
from Myrtle H and Laureatea.
Dolly Weithoff at 6 to 5 was laid away
in the six-furlong run following. She
had speed for a time; then the curtain
fell. The last eighth Ultruda waded
through the bunch, galloping home ahead
of Nona B and Troy. The winner was a
rank outsider, 6 to 1 being obtainable
about him.
Eight started In the concluding four

an easy first over Erne, the Curl entry
with Knapp up. Red Tip was third.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 19.â As a result ot
the unsatisfactory ending of the Pasadena
stake on Saturday when the judges placet.
Kenilworth' first and nine out of every
ten people present thought Blis3ful won
by almost a length the two horses men
tioned will meet at Agricultural Park to
morrow in a special for a $500 purse.
They -will meet under the same condi
tions. Even should the brown horse bÂ«
returned -a winner all of the conditions
cannot be the same. Kenilworth is apt
to be a Detter horse to-morrow, and then
again Willie See may handle him differ
ently.
This was "ladies' day" at the track and
a . large crowd saw some very ragged
sport. The syndlcators cinched up the
prices until the slates creaked and
groaned and must have cleaned up $3000
or $4000, as they did on Saturday. Three
so-called favorites blossomed *forth as
winners.
Vic Gilbert purchased Dug Martin from
Lee Blaslngame on Sunday and to-day
won the gelding out In the opening mile
run. The ring laid three to one about
him, and, picking up the running, he led
all the way, finishing out the route in
l:4l&. Blue Miracle, the even money fa

George H. Ketcham, who owns Cres
ceus, and who drove him to-day, said to
night:
"This is the beet track cut of doors and
the conditions w*re perfect. "When I -was
here week before last the track was wet,
but I saw its advantages and determined
to con* back. The result justified my
expectations. I knew before the race that
the stallion would beat "his record, but I
did not expect a triumph so complete. I
shall go to Oklahoma City and Fort
Scott right away to keep engagements
and that will be the last time he will ap
pear In public."
Ketcham worked the horse out in 2:15
before the final test and then sent him
flying for the, record. He broke when he
first scored for the word, but on the next
attempt was sent off, going the first quar
ter in :30 flat. There was a cheer when he
reached the half iti :59Â»i, and when the
three-quarters was passed in 1:30 the
cheer becante an uproar. Just before he
reached the wire Cresceus broke, and it
is believed lost fully three-quarters of a
second. He came up handily and flashed
under the wire in 1:59%.
The day was simply perfect .and the
track in prime condition. Cresceus was
paced by a running mate, Mike the
Tramp, to a sulky. Cresceus had no wind
break whatever. The first quarter was
made in :30, the half in :59%, the three
quarters in 1:30 and the mile In 1:59%.
"WICHITA, Kans., Oct. 19.â Such an
ovation as waa given Cresceus when he
trotted a mile In 1:59% to-day and made a
new world's record has been rarely wit
nessed. The stallion was nearly smoth
ered to death, so eager were the specta
tors to pat or get near enough to touch
him. Â»

to-day visited the undertaker who had
charge of the funeral and Informed him
that she had Just learned of her spouse's

She said that she had not lived with

of George Henry Rowe, but who Erick
son claims is "William George Curthew, is
now In the Haywards jail. Erlckson told
Marshal Ramage of Haywards that a re

rest of the accused and he was promptly
taken Into custody. ; r C
The prisoner vehemently denied the
story and asserted that he could prove
that he was In Jail at the time the al
leged theft occurred. "Word from New
York bears out the prisoner's statement.
If It does not go even farther and estab
lish that no embezzlement, such as Is al
leged to have taken place by Erlckson.
occurred. The New York Detective Bu
reau said that no man by the name of
Carthew was wanted In New York for
embezzlement, and that it knew of no
crime having been committed with which
the accused could have had connection.
Another feature of the case is that
Erlckson is not known at 213 Pine street,
which address ne gave, nor does his name
appear In the directory of this city. In
all probability the prisoner will be re
leased to-day and. If he can be located.

Secretary McCarthy of the Fire Com
mission contended that the moneys could
be used Indiscriminately so long as the
total expenditures did not exceed one
twelfth of the combined appropriation.
"We differ with you there," said Chair
man Brandensteln, "and we Â¦ hold that
each item should be distinct ', from the
other. You will have to get the opinion
o*. the City Attorney in support of your
claim before we will pass tho demands."
The allowance under the one-twelfth ac:
for the last three months for expenses
was 124,500 and the expenditures for the
same time were $25,069 16, an overdraft of
$569 16. For salaries the allowance was
$184,735 50 and the amount expended was
$180,843 81, leaving a surplus of $3S93 69.
The fact that there is a surplus in the
salary account did not change the com
mittee"d determination to hold the Fira
Commission to a strict account for the in
dividual appropriations.
The petition of the Board of Works that
an ordinance be passed providing for the

The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday declined to audit certain de
mands of the Fire Commission for Octo
ber aggregating $8471 12 until the City At
torney has rendered an opinion as to
whether the commission has the right to
overdraw its accounts In excess cf the
one-twelfth provision of the charter.
The refusal of the committee to sign the
demands arises over the fact that in the
budget the sum of $98,000 was allowed the
Fire Department for expenses and $844,450
for salaries.
All I need to demonstrate that I can do
what I say is a powerful enough motor of light
weight to propel properly the makeshift ar
rangements I have on my present car. These
propellers now are attached to the sides of the
car and are two In number. Instead of being
four In number, and being placed at the four
corners of the frame, where they can exert
the proper amount of leverage. I am hopeful
thet my recent experience will be the cause
of supplying me with sufficient funds to se
cure thÂ« proper motor and then I will demon
strate beyond a doubt the feasibility of my
theories of navigating the air.
Since Dr. Greth's successful experi
ment there has arisen a crop of aeronauts
who are willing. to chance the dangers of
making an ascension In the machine he
invented and navigated. .Personally he is
opposed to further attempts until he has
secured proper motive power. He does
not fear that he will meet with disaster,
but he wishes to demonstrate beyond
doubt that he can direct the airship, and
he does not care to risk a faijure because
of defective machinery. The aeronaut
employed by the company, B. R. Saxby,
has announced his" willingness to make
an ascent with the present motor, and
yesterday told the lessee of the machine
that he could have everything in readi
ness by to-morrow. Tne matter was
taken under advisement, and it is pos
sible that a second ascent may be made
next Sunday. , .
NEEDS ONXY A MOTOR.
The greatest Improvement I hava made is
In the propellers. The Santos-Dumont frames
are equipped with only one stationary propeller
placed at tho end. Accordingly when It Is de
sired to ascend and the motor is started, the
balloon tips at an acute angle, and to right
jt It is necessary to use a sliding compensating
weight. The eame thing occurs when It is
desired to descend and again the weight must
be used. Any change in zone calls for the use
of- the compensating weight to enable the bal
loon to regain its horizontal position.
In my perfected machine there are four pro
pellers one at each cardinal point of the
frame 'and all worked through universal shafts
by one motor. These propellers can be worked
separately or together and at any angle. Just
the name as four oars in a boat. By their
proper manipulation the balloon can always
be held In a horizontal position and can be
raised, lowered and driven In any direction
desired.
Another thing I have done is to swing my
frame only seven feet below the balloon, ren
dering the machine more easily dirigible. Â¦ The
other models have the frame swung twenty
feet below the balloon and this makes the
framework a drag on the buoyancy of the ma
chine and renders the balloon hard to control.
By my experiment I proved that the proximity
of the gasoline motor to the balloon was not
a dangerous factor.
The third and most feasible airship from a
pecuniary point of view Is a machine modeled
after the same principles adopted in- the one
I used in my trip Sunday. It consists of a
supporting balloon, elliptical in shape, and con
nected with a frame swung underneath It.
which carries the motor power and steering
gear ami a place for the navigator. The shape
of the balloon is the same as that in use by
Santos-Dumont and Spencer, but I have im
proved over them by doing away with the
balloonette. which is a smaller balloon filled
with air and designed to equalize the expan
sion In the hydrogen balloon. .
The balloonette 1b unsatisfactory because It
vitiates the hydrogen by introducing air into
It. Instead of that I have a special netting
over my balloon, which keeps It taut on top
and at the ends, even with a small supply
of gas and prevents the possibility of "buck
ling." Santos-Dumont met with a catastrophe
because his balloon doubled up on him. My
balloon will always preserve Its shape.
OTHER IMPROVEMENTS.
Accordingly we are left with two. .possible
problems. One is an airship with a. gas bag
inside and containing machinery and steering
appliances with accommodations for freight
and passengers. This must necessarily be on
a large scale and its size, which Increases the
carrying capacity according to the amount of
hydrogen gas. would have to be enormous.
To be properly dirigible and have a commer
cial value it would have to be as large as our
greatest ocean liners. I have models for this
kind of an airship and I hope to live to see
one completed along the lines of my plans.
The cost of It is all that deters me from con
structing one at present. -
FEASIBLE AIRSHIPS.
It consists of a balloon and a suspended
frame, which carries the motor, the pro
pelling and steering gear and the navi
gator. The navigator stands on a frail
platform with only a railing to keep him
from being pitched out. The wheel for
the steering gear and the levers operating
the propellers are within easy reach. The
deflated balloon was stretched along the
floor of the shed yesterday, and a consid
erable volume of gas still remained in it.
When inflated It has a length of seventy
five feet and a maximum diameter of
twenty-five feet It costs $300 to inflate
it with hydrogen gas. The generator
and cooling and purifying tanks are lo
cated outside the shed and the gas is fed
to the balloon through a silk leader.
Dr. Greth explained fully the exclusive
properties of his machine, as compared
to the Santos-Dumont and Spencer ma
chines. He said:
There are three kinds of flying 1 machines, so
called. The first In theory consists of a ma
chine that needs no buoyant attachment and
can raise Itself by its own force, as a bird
does. As I have said, I regard this sort of a
machlno impossible in the present development
of force. The weight of the best power wa
have increases in geometrical proportion to it;
raisins power, so that if we have an engine
weighing two pounds, for instance, and capa
ble of raising two pounds from the earth by
itself, and should desire to double its raising
capacity, we would have to increase its weight
to eight pounds. Manifestly, when we desire
to utilize ruch power to raise a ton, for in
stance, the weight of the engine alone would
be fo great as to preclude It raising.-. Itself.
Birds do not grow to large size because an
increase In their weight would preclude their
flying freely.
DESCRIPTION" OF MACHINE.
Safely housed in a shed in the vacant
lot in the rear of the premises at
Eleventh and Market streets, the Greth
airship was viewed yesterday by. thou
sands of curious sightseers, who were
anxious to gain a more intimate acquaint
ance with the strange craft they had
seen sailing through the heavens Sun
day morning. As far as could be ascer
tained the mechanism escaped injury dur
ing the voyage and descent The Inventor
and navigator, well groomed and showing
no traces of his perilous voyage, was in
attendance most of the day, good
naturedly answering questions and ex
plaining to the inquisitive the theory of
his aerial machine. There is nothing in
his manner to suggest the great ad
venturer. He regards his trial trip as a
success, but he underestimates the danger
and laughingly dismisses ail references
to his courage.
"It is as safe as riding in a street car
and infinitely more pleasant," he said.
"All one has to do is to know one's busi
ness and keep one's head."
There is no secret regarding the mechan
ism of this airship. It is not kept under
lock and key and accessible only to the
inventor, as is the case with the Langley
machine. Whatever exclusive properties
it has are protected by patents and the
manipulation of it is apparent to a lay
man.
The hearing of the protest against the
assessment for a sewer in Richland
avenue was turned over to the street
committee for investigation.
The board passed to print an ordinance
repealing ordinance No. 972, fixing the tax
rate for municipal purposes at 84.4 cents
per $100, assessed valuation, based on the
raise in the assessment roll by the State
Board of Equalization. Action was taken
on a decision of the Supreme Court that
the legal rate is $1,076, based on the lower
valuation- as returned by Assessor Dodge.
The City Attorney advised the board
either to pay the Judgments obtained
against the city, and fixing the value of
lands belonging to Joseph Musto and
Martin Colmann, or else to decide not to
purchase the lands at the figures fixed
by the court and dismissing the proceed
ings.
A proposed ordinance regulating the
maintenance of maternity hospitals, Jy
ing-in asylums and homes for children
was referred to the health committal.
That all objectionable buildings be re
moved in the block bounded by Sixteenth
street, Division street, San Bruno avenue
and Rhode Island street, which it is said
the Western Pacific Company proposes to
acquire.
That the company will improve- all
streets in the vicinity of the property to
be acquired.
The board referred back to the Board
of Works for action the petition from the
Laborers' Protective Union requesting an
increase in the salaries of all the laborers
employed under the Jurisdiction of the
Board of Public Works from $2 50 to $3
per day.
Attention is called to the charter pro
visions and an ordinance under which the
power vests in the Board of Public "Works
to determine the compensation to be paid
to its employes. The attention of the
board is also called to the fact that It is
in a better position to determine the com
pensation of its own employes than is an
other department of the municipal gov
ernment, and it is the opinion of the
Board of Supervisors that the matter con
tained in the petition of the Laborers'
Protective Union deserves an immediate
and careful hearing and determination.
The resolution setting aside $5000 out of
the fund for urgent necessities to be ex
pended under the direction of the board,
with the advice of the Health Board, in
the continuance of the- sanitary proce
dures now in progress in Chinatown, was
finally passed.
The communication of the Lick and
Wllmerding District Improvement Club
that it is in favor, on certain conditions,
of the grant of franchise to the Western
Pacific Railway Company along Sixteenth
street from Kansas street to the bay was
referred to the street committee. The
conditions are:
That Kansas street ba left open at all
times to traffic.
That San Bruno avenue be opened to
Ninth street.
An ordinance was introduced at yester
day's meeting of the "Board of Super
visors by D'Ancona and referred to
the police committee providing for the
licensing of any shooting gallery at
large which may be maintained by
any regularly organized revolver, pis
tol or rifle club having an enrolled
membership of ten or more per
sons. The ordinance fixes the license at
$10 per year and gives the Chief of Po
lice power to Inspect any such gallery or
range.
After some heated discussions, Buck
left to get legal assistance, thinking his
wife would certainly remain at the farm
over night. No sooner, however, was his
back turned than Mrs. Buck hustled her
children into the buggy, once more and
hurried for the train, but. seeing her hus
band near the depot with two men, she
took another road and caught an electric
car bound for Erie. From that moment
her course was clear, and Mrs. Buck, and
her children arrived safely back in this
<jKy on Sunday afternoon.
Arriving soon after. Buck and his com
panions surrounded the house: but it was
evident that he knew from the first that
the children had been taken by his wife,
and not by a gipsy.
.Mrs. Buck saw her pursuers; her good
horpe answered her urging, and she ar
rived first across the State line and got
shelter at the farm of O. L. Lathrop, at
North East.
A DESPERATE RACE.
On Thursday. September 24. she took
train for New York State, and when there
familiarized herself with the vicinity of
her husband's farm and the outlying
country. She also made herself acquaint
ed with every railroad and street-car ser
vice, and, when ready, which happened to
be last Tuesday, October 13, she hired a
swift horse in the neighborhood of Mina,
and, heavily veiled, droved past the farm,
where she saw Buck at work, and await
ed the coming of her children from school.
When they came In sight Mrs. Buck
threw back her veil, and a pathetic scene
followed the reunion. John and his sister
climbed into the buggy and willingly con
sented to be concealed. The elated mother
then gave the horse his head and sped
toward the Pennsylvania State line, some
ten miles away. In the meantime Buck
had been apprised that a gipsy had kid
naped his children, and soon the news
spread, and constables, deputy sheriffs
and farmers, on horses and In buggies
and hay wagons, and armed with pitch
forks and pickhandles, were hot In pur
suit.
MOTHER MEETS CHILDREN.
In March last John S. Buck, a motor
man In the employ of the United Railroads
Company, by a subterfuge secured pos
session of his two children, John, 6 years
of age, and Margaret, aged 7. who were
visiting their grandmother at Dougherty.
Alameda County, and took them, un
known to their mother, to New York
State.
Mrs. Buck, whose ten years of married
life had not been harmonious, after she
found- that her children had been spirited
away, made Inquiries throughout San
Francisco and neighboring cities for her
children, but it was only recently,
through the aid of Secretary M. J. Whlto
of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, that she was mado
aware that they were living with Buck on
a farm at Mina, New York State.
Instead of giving her time up to weep
ing and wringing her hands over the loss
of her. boy and girl, Mrs. Buck set to
work to accumulate enough money to
travel East and rescue the children. With
this purpose In view, she accepted the
position of- a nurse, and when she had
saved $300 prepared for her venturesome
Journey.

I am unable to concur In that portion of
the opinion which holds that the trial court
erred In not ordering under the prayer for
general relief that a new tale of the mort
gaged premises be had. The rule la well Â«et
tled that under the prayer for general relief
the court may decree only such relief as la
conformable to the case made by the bill.

An oil barge lying at Pteuart street wharf,
alongside the ship Ftar of Italy, took fire yes
terday afternoon and for a few minutes mat
ters looked % - ery serious for the salmon ship.
A few buckets of water, however, promptly
*ni properly applied, extinguished the fire,
which, though insignificant and short lived,
was big enough to form the* foundation of a
rumor that gave the local marine underwriters
a few unpleasant thrills. By the time the
*tcry. of the blaze reached California street
the yarn had developed until It told of the
destruction of the Star of Italy and a large
part of her valuable cargo. Traveling with the
tale were details of how the salmon blazed
and a dozen explanations of the fire's origin.
The Star of Italy, however, was rot even
warmed by the short lived blaze and the great
**t excitement was caused by a discussion of
what might have happened.

Fields of Ice were encountered on June
20. in latitude 59 south, longitude 62 west.
It was necessary to keep the^ahip off her
course for nearly six hours""in order to
avoid being crushed in the grip of the Ice.

Scotland after she had rounded the cape
and the rest of the voyage was unevent
ful.
little anxiety to those Interested
in her, came into port yesterday with
a story of terrific weather encountered off
Cape Horn. The Crown of Scotland was
nearly six weeks fighting her way around
Cape Horn and not only battled westerly
gales and high seas but fought her way
along ths outskirts of an Icefield that
an unkind fate had floated directly across
her path.
The big windjammer left Newcastle,
England. April 11, with a cargo of gen
eral merchandise for this port. Light
winds made slow sailing as far as the
equator and between there and Staton
Island some heavy storms were weatn
ered. Cape Horn was reached eighty-two
days after leaving Newcastle. From the
west there came snorting across the bleak,
waters a whole procession of heavy gales,
into which the Crown of Scotland jammed
her graceful nose with all the abandon
of a weather beaten porpoise. She did
lots of sailing, but made modest head
way and maintained the battle for forty
two days before the Horn was finally
rounded.

BRITISH SHIP CROWN OF SCOTLAND WHICH WAS ON THE OVERDUE LIST. BUT WHICH ARRIVED HERE
YESTERDAY AFTER A TUMULTUOUS VOYAGE FROM ENGLAND AND A FORTY-TWO-DAY BATTLE
WITH THE ELEMENTS OFF CAPE HORN.
Two Privates Are Court Martialed.
HONOLULU, Oct. 13. â Privates T.
Sheeky and G. Connelly, en route to
Manila on the transport Sherman, were
tried by court martial on board the ves
sel while she was here. Sheeky was sen
tenced to three months* imprisonment
and a fine of $30 for assaulting and at
tempting to hold up a Chinese In Hono
lulu. Connelly was found guilty of being
drunk and disorderly. The men on the
Sherman in general made an unusually
good record for behavior while In port,
the police" haying very little trouble with
them. .
On Monday a report was made by the
Attorney General to the effect that no
contempt had been committed aÂ«d the
case went on. Kamuela was found guilty
and sentenced to eighteen months* hard
labor.
The case served to bring out the fact
that under Judge Gear's recent decision,
according to many attorneys, contempt of
court Is an infamous crime in Hawaii,
and requires a Grand Jury indictment, so
that the court is powerless to act sum
marily.
HONOLULU, Oct. 13.â A criminal trial
in Judge Gear's court was Interrupted
last Friday by the refusal of the jury to
go on, on account of a publication in the
Advertiser to the effect that attorneys
had drawn the color line in challenging
Jurors and had left only one white man
on the jury. Prince David, who* was one
of the jurors, objected to such a publi
cation and others did likewise. The de
fendant was a native named- Kamuela,
charged with assault with a deadly
weapon, Judge Gear stated that he did
not blame the Jurors for their attitude
and adjourned the case till Monday, re
ferring the matter to Attorney General
Andrews for action.
Refuses to Proceed With Trial of
Case Until After an Investi
gation Is Made.
HONOLULU JURY OBJECTS
TO NEWSPAPER CRITICISM
The capital stock consists of 24,000 shares
of the par value of $5 each, of which all
but 20,000 shares have been issued. The
sales were made chiefly during the first
year of the company's existence and â¢while
James Hamilton Lewis, former Congress
man from Washington, was president of
the company. Lewis was one of the in
corporators and owned a block of stock.
After serving one year as president he
resigned and moved to Chicago.
Judge Snell finds that nearly $100,000
â¢worth of stock was sold, chiefly in East
ern cities. Under Judge Snell's decision
yesterday small stockholders can obtain
judgment for the amounts they paid for
the stock. The company has now taken
an appeal to the Supreme Court,
TACOMA, Oct. 19.â Judge Snell of the
Superior^ Court has sugsested that the
prosecuting attorneys of Tacoma and Se
attle investigate the transactions of the
Washington Match Company, and espe
cially its sale of stock in large blocks at
high prices, when the company actually
owned no patents or special machinery
as set forth in its prospectus.
Special Dispatch to The Call. Â»
Officers of all steamers that have ar- ;
rived from Hawaii during the past week !
report the volcanic activity on the sum- '
Bit of Mauna LÂ»na. though some of them |
differ as to the rxact location from which :
the fire and smoke ascend skyward.
A wireless messape received to-day from i
Hilo states that there has been no I
crease m the volcano's activity since the ;
ostbreik Ol a week ago. also that Kilauei \
15 smnki'iir. Passengers on steamers pass- ]
ing along the coast of Hawaii report that '
thr re is a grand display visible.

Six lava flows were reported coming i
Elowty down the mountain side, but these
seem to have merged into one that Is
moving in the direction of Kahuka ranch, ;
owned by Ccloncl Norris. This property j
was recently offered for sale in Chicago |
for $350,000. It contains 3Sfi,f>03 acres, some j
CO .000 of which are already deeply cov- 1
<>re-d with lava that spread over the land i
<1urir!p two previous eruptions. There are i
Vi^twern MOO and O00 head of cattle on
the ranch.
Wireless cable and mail advices from !
tÂ»;e island of Hawaii nave since confirmed
the report brought by the ship Ormsary.
the volcanic activity beinp from the sum- j
mit crater of Mokuaweoweo, on Mauna j
I-oa. at a height of more than 13,000 feet!
above sea level.
The tmcke arose from a point in the side
of the hill below the summit. It ehot up |
Â» it!i treat rapidity, as If impelled by Mrae j
rrsfft tremendous force. It then spread out to ;
the sides, and as new smoke continually kept 1
fhootlng up a dense cloud kept Catherine. ,
Durirjt thÂ» day we could not see the flre. but
irward dusV; a larse thert of flame, spreading I
Â¦ txrat a mile, could be nlaln!y oeen. The fire i
did not die down, but after we had been watch- J
Snjr It for about two hours and a half we lo?t i
Fight of it. as the atmosphere became very
ti.lck with smefce and clouds. We did net see
any ashes, but this (Joes not indicate that there
were none. The wind was euch that afhes and j
anything of that kind would have been car- ,
ned aft of uf.
The outbreak of the volcano we saw the next
day between 12 m. and 1 p. m. The first
thins: visible was a preat column of ymoke
which fhot uj> sudderily from a point which,
1 Judged, maet have been neat the crater of

The waves at times broke over the vessel,
which was render* d absolutely unmanageable.

tic-narj' arid acted exactly at if she were an
chored.
HOXOLl'LU, Oct. 13.â Details of an
outbreak of the volcano on Mauna Ix>a,
island of Hawaii, were received here on
October 7. The news v.as brought by the
BtiiSsh ehfp Ormsary. from Newcastle. !
On October 5 she was off Kailua, Koni, j
Hawaii, and was then whirled about on j
the bosom of the ocean as if she had j
been a. cork. There was no use for the j
wheel, since the vessel became absolutely j
unmanageable. The activity was but a j
forerunner of a grand display of volcan'i=
power on the next day. when dense vol- j
umes of smoke were seen to shoot heav
er.ward and Vpread out in clouds over the
island of Hawaii. This has since been j
continued without interruption. j
Captain Coath tells the following story j
of his extraordinary experience:
At fe o'clock en the evening of October 7,
it my C<mskI was oft the coaet of Hawkli, we
had k ir.ost ur.lque experience. The t-en. be- j

CHICAGO. Oct. 19.â Wheat was "decidedly
unsettled and the volume of. business* falr!y
large. Opening prices were easier, due to lawor,
cables and the large world's shlpmcnti. with
Russia still showing up strongly In contribu
ting to the general supply. Weather through
out the West and Northwest was also :t~ jl
favorable character and Induced much selling.
Rumors of impending trouble In Wall street
had some Influence early In the day and surr
rounded by all these bearish advances Decem
ber opened at Vi<8%c lower at 80%c to SO'-ic
and prices held around the opening fisrur.js until
noon, when a sharp upturn occurred on heavy
buying of December by a proonnent local tull,
which induced shorts to cover. With litrhc
offerings the price started "upward ami Decem
ber sold up to 81 %c. but at that figure, offer
ings became liberal and the decline which fol
lowed was as sudden as the rally. On the
general selling December declined to ?<Hic land
the close was at 804@80%c, a loss of 5&fÂ£%c
for the day. â¢ A â¢
Corn ruled weak under heavy sellinsr by
commission houses and provision people. De
cember closed with a loss of l@lÂ»4c at 4340
43 He.
Weakness In wheat and corn, together with
increased receipts and good weather for the
movement, caused lower prices in oats. De
cember closed down lgl^ic at 34%@34%c.
Liquidation in October lard was the. feature
In the trading In provisions and, with only a
small support from brokers, the market ruled
weak. Heavy receipts of hogs, with a decline
of from 10c to 20c in prices at the yards, were
early bear factors. January pork closed 124c
lower, lard wa* off 20c, while ribs were down
74 c.

more failures seem to be due to thÂ« eame
causes which have necessitated the greater
rÂ»rt of the prolonged liquidation In the Mock
market, namely, over-commitments In the pro
motion and underwriting of new enterprises,
! the f*curitles of which have no market In the.
1 present state of the monej- market. The reve
lation disclosed by the Baltimore failures
causes the drawing of uncomfortable infer
ences. It Is a remarkable fact also that up
to to-day the enormous shrinkage in the value
of securities and the urgent requirement*
which have beÂ«n met In liquidation haÂ» not
caused a single failure in the banking and
trust company world. Reassuring statements
Â«ere published as to the limited field of the
Baltimore troubles, but these did not much
avail to cheer the sentiment In the stock mar
ket. There was a midday pause In the decline
after the completion of the London selling.
But the a-nnouneement of the second Baltimore
failure caused a renewal of the decline with
increased violence and the closing was heavy
and only slightly above the lowest. Illinois
Ontral made a spasmodic recovery of 1%.
The bond market yielded in sympathy with
stocks after some early resistance. Total sales,
par value. $4.410. <V>rt.
United States bonds were all unchanged on

Local trade In fruits wa* rather quiet, but
as receipts were Hgrht thÂ«rÂ» were no great
changes in. price. Apples, which were in trw
supply, continued to move freely. There was
a limited demand for the Spitsenberg and Bald
win varieties at ?1 25 p*r box, but for other
varfetits the top quotation was an extreme
figure. Fancy Winter Nellls Pears were in
brisk demand for storage purposes and cleaned
up well at eteady rates. Small shipments of.
Persimmons were received and met with prompt
pale at good figures. Pomegranates and Quinces
were steady and unchanged. - There were not
enough Figs offering for a quotation. Tabl<Â»
Grapes and Melons were In ample supply and
steady, as the warm weather stimulated the,
demand. Prices of large open boxes had a wide
ranpe aÂ« to variety and quality. Fancy Muscat
told readily at the top rate, while Tokays,
which were the most plentiful, were slow at
75ci?*l. The demand for Wine Grapes con
tinued slack and the market was very much
depressed. Receipts were liberal and Included
much poor and leaking stock, which would be
hard to dispose of even under more favorable
conditions.

WASHINGTON, Oot- 10.â President Roose
velt, at the request of Senator Proctor, has
decided to Investigate - further tha case of
United States Marshal Field of Vermont, wh?
was . removed because of the escape of two
Chinese who were In the custody of one of
Field's deputies.'
The entire mornlnsr was taken up with
the consideration of the objections by
counsel for General' Chase to the com
petency of the court in general becausa
of its inferiority In rank to General Chase
and to Colonel "W. R. Gilbert of Colo
rado Springs and Major H. A. Naylor of
Victor, and on the additional grounds of
lack of military experience, friendship for
the complaining witness. Adjutant Gen
eral Sherman Bell, and personal animus
against General Chase.
In every case the objections were over
ruled. The court was then sworn In. Col
onel Kenneth I_ Fahnestock of Governor
Peabody's staff is its president.
DENVER, Oct 19.â The court-martial
called by Governor James H. Peabody
to Investigate charges against members
of the National Guard of Colorado met
in the Senate chamber at the Capitol at
10 o'clock to-day and when an adjourn
ment was taken this afternoon the ques
tion of postponing the consideration of
the. charges filed against Brigadier Gen
eral John Chase, until recently in com
mand of the troops at Cripple Creek, had
been decided adversely to the general.
The application for a postponement i_
based upon the statement of the attor
neys for General Chase that they are not
prepared to continue with the hearing, as
they had been denied access to certain
books and papers in the adjutant gen
eral's office necessary for the proper prep
aration of their case, and for the addi
tional reason that the leading counsel for
General Chase is unavoidably absent from.

cable, to prepare a scheme of labor concilia
tion adapted to the needs of the

which wae adopted by the chamber. After
full discussion the chamber authorized the
formation cf a conciliation board.
Omitting minor details the board was and

employers, who ere annually elected by the
council of the chamber, and of twelve repre
Â«Â«entaUve8 of labor, annually elected by the
i'lepa'.es of the trades unions of London, all
the London trades unions being annually in
vjtÂ»d to elect these delegates. An equality of
voting powÂ«-r to the members of the board is
j-rov|de<i for. The methods of the board con
eirt firstly, on hearing of any labor dispute
within the metropolitan district, of an offer of
It* f'n-iccB to both disputants, and of an in
vitation to a friendly conference, on neutral
grround. that is, in the rooms of the Chamber

upon the mutual exercise of conscience and

Marshall was not far wronc when he said
"Economic laws and reasonings, in fact, are
merely part of the material of which conscience
tnd common sense have to make use in solving
practical problems and in laying down rules
which may be a puide in life." Conscience
should tÂ«-arh both employer and employed that
neither should depart from the justice and

Filcher Is Back and Tells
of His Work at
St. Louis.
J. A. Fllcher of the California commis
sion to the St. Louis Exposition Is back
from St. Louis. His mission In the Ease
was to preserve to California the original
amount of floor room for exhibition pur
poses assigned to this State some months
ago and to open bids and award the con
tract for the construction of the Cali
fornia State building. He found that a
decision had been reached by the hea^
of a department to take away space fro Jb
this State in the Agricultural building.
As the allotment had been secured in the
regular order of business and as the com
missioners had In writing an agreement
as to what California was to have. Com
missioner Fllcher at once combated the
idea of any reduction.
On the basis of the original assignment.
which meant about 40,000 square feet of
floor Jn the agricultural building alone,
the understanding being that this was
Irrevocable, the California commissioners
have for some months been encouraging
the people of the State to provide ample
exhibits.
FILCHES IS FIRM.
If the room was to be cut down the
State commissioners would be compelled
to curtail their plans that were calculated
to give California the prominence in the
agricultural building to which its prod
ucts entitle It. Consequently Commis
sioner Fllcher vigorously asserted that he
would demand the space. If the head of
the department would not give It to him
he would take the matter up to the presi
dent; if that would not do it would go to
the directors; if this was unavailing he
was prepared to test the agreement In
court.
Commissioner Fllcher says that the
upshot of the discussion as to the Cali
fornia space was that while there has
been a rearrangement, it leaves this State
with the original amount of floor area for
show purposes and in a compact body
near the main entrance of the agrlâ*
cultural building, which Is the star po
sition.
The bids for the construction of the
California building were found to range
from $26.COO up to $49,000. As the plans of
the commissioners Included an expendi
ture of only $13,(xXÂ» for the building. It was
found necessary to revise them. A skilled
architect was called in to make the re
vision. The original architectural de
vice of having the building in the shape
of the Santa Barbara mission was re
tained. The, proportions were cut down
about one-fourth. Then bids were Invited.
This time the cost came Inside of the
$15,000 limit fixed by the commission.
BUILDING WELL ADVANCED.
The lowest bidder was Henry W.
Schlueter of Chicago, and to him the con
tract was awarded at the price of $14,873.
The next lowest bidder's figures wero
$1150 higher than Schlueter's. The suc-%
cessful bidder is constructing the trans
portation building, the fraternity build-
Ing, the Wisconsin State building and
several large structures on the Midway
at St. Louis. He is the largest Individual
contractor for the erection of buildings
in the United States. The State building
will be ample on its present lines, so Mr.
Fllcher says. In the original arrange
ment were Included many details that
were more elaborate than were found to
be necessary upon revision.
Commissioner Filcher says that the
buildings of the exposition are much
farther advanced than they were at Chi
cago at a corresponding time after the
construction work was begun. Of elevn '
large exposition buildings, seven are
completed. Around the California build
ing, which will stand on a hill, will be
gathered the Illinois State building, the
fraternity building, the Ferris wheel and
Jerusalem. The Japanese building will
be near. This hill Is now considered tr>
be a choice building site. The space there
Is all occupied.
Meeting for Mothers.
Mothers are cordially Invited to attend
the meeting at the Hearst Grammar
School In room 6 to-morrow at 3:15 p. m.
There will be pleasant talks, good music
and discussions on home subjects.
