CORVALLIS. Or., Oct. 30.â This town
has been agog for twenty-four hours with
the doings of the members of a religious
sect whom some persons call- "The Holy
Rollers." In the fanaticism of their de
votions the enthusiasts have burned fur
niture, carpets and clothing. Musical In
struments of all kinds, without regard to
value, have been delivered to the flames.
The scene of their devotions is a house
in the south end of the town. The side
walks about the premises were torn up
yesterday and burned and the flowers,
shrubbery and fruit trees were destroyed.
During the day dogs and cats were
burned on a sacrificial fire. Members of
the sect deny the case of the cats, but
admit that a dog was sacrificed.
A feature that has added materially to
the public Interest is that O. V. Hurt,
ex-chairman of the Republican County
Central Committee and at present State
commltteeman, has Joined the sect. For
mer members of the Salvation Army are
also devoted worshipers.
This afternoon two of the high priests
of the sect were tried before the County

JURY TAKES
FEW MINUTES
WITH PARKS
Walking Delegate
Guilty of Ex
tortion.
NEW YORK, Oct. 30.â For the second
time within two months > Samuel Parks,
walking delegate of the Housesmiths' and
Bridgemen's Union No. 2, was convicted
of the crime of extortion in the Court
of -General Sessions this afternoon. It
took the Jury Just twelve minutes, dur
ing, which time they balloted twice, to
agree on the guilt of Parks In extorting
$500 from Tiffany Studios, a firm of con
tractors, under threat of keeping them
from continuing work on a building last
January.
It was shown at the trial that Parks
had obtained $500 from the Tiffany firm
as "an initiation fee" last January when
the housesmiths and bridgemen were on
strike on three of the Tiffany contracts in
this city. Parks claimed that this money
was a fine levied by his labor union.
Later the fact developed that Parks had
been disloyal to his union, inasmuch as
he permitted the" Tiffany firm to .employ
non-union men on jobs after having re
ceived the $300. â¢
This accusation was not denied by the
defendant or his counsel during the trial,
but the latter contended that Parks had
given the money to the treasurer of his
organization and that the entire transac
tion was a business deal which Instead of
being a crime afforded considerable
business advantage to the firm which paid
him. Counsel for Parks endeavored to
introduce certificates as to the prisoner's
delicate state of health, but Judge New
berger, before whom the case was tried,
refused to admit them.
When the jury was polled and the ver
dict rendered Parks glared at the Jury
men "with the same look of defiance which
he' maintained during this as well as his
previous trial. He was remanded for sen
tence a week hence. Parks is now await
ing the decision of the higher court on a
writ of error, having been sentenced after
his trial to a term of not less than two
and a half nor more^ than three and a half
years in Sing Sing prison.: The charge on
which' bis, former conviction was secured
was also extortion.

1 "The President Is the leader of his k party

the solid. negro vote (for in;votingYthey

"Thoughtful citizens, both North and
South, regret such' an issue. They; dread
It and will evade it if possible. But If the
President and' his party drive the | Issue
it must be met and the responsibility
must rest upon them.
"Mr. Roosevelt, in his anxiety to be
constantly doing something, has made a
mistake. I believe of him as I have be
lieved of all the Presidents, 'that he is
sincere and patriotic. But every man in
public position is liable to mistakes. None
could be more serious than the one made
by him in his attempt to force again: to
the front the question of equality, social
and political, of the negro race.
"Immediately after the close of the war
came the adoption of the fourteenth and
fifteenth amendments, which enfran
chised the blacks for party purposes
alone and thus injected into the body
politic a people unprepared and unfitted
for self-government. The Anglo-Saxon
has never and ,wlll never tolerate the so
cial equality or the political domination
of the negro race.
STATION OF THE NEGRO.
"I have a, great respect for the Presi
dent. He ought not to be lightly or un
justly criticized. But lovers of liberty
must enter their earnest protest whenever
high officers. of the Government exercise
powers or commit acts which tend to re
strict the rights of the people or unduly
interfere in matters of State concern.
"President Roosevelt is 'a man of fine
attainments and of honest "convictions.
He is young In years, impulsive, ambi
tious; is a partisan and believes In his
party. In his anxiety for its success he
is liable to make mistakes, and In my
Judgment he has committed a most
grievous error in forcing, to the front an
issue which must be deplored by all the
conservative men of the country.
"In every country where the race issue
has risen It has always carried In its
wake lamentable results. It has been at
tended by evil consequences.* I trust his
earnestness and impetuosity may be re
stricted and that he may be prevailed
upon to accept wiser counsel In his treat
ment of the negro problem. From the day
a cargo of Africans was landed and sold
as slaves until this hour the burden of
the white man of this country has been
more than that borne by any people
known to history. It was one of "the
causes which led to a most gigantic war,
which drenched the country in blood, de
stroying many homes and impoverishing
a gallant people.
CRITICISM OF ROOSEVELT.
"The extraordinary, unusual, and, I
think you will agree with me, unfortu
nate activity and interest displayed by
the President of the United States in par
ticipating in his party's councils by call
ing to Washington the prominent Repub
licans-of this State is such an uncalled
for Interference In our domestic affairs
that It must be met with no uncertain
protest by our people. '
"Ordinarily the result of the State elec
tion concerns the . people ' of the State
alone. Its only bearing upon national
politics is the fact that the Legislature to
be elected will elect a Senator to repre
sent this State in the Senate of the United
States. But circumstances and occur
rences which have been forced upon us
make Â«the result of this year of more than
local import.
The most important address of the even
ing was that of Senator Gorman, who, in
addition to his advocacy of the State
ticket and his excoriation of -the Republi
cans, referred to President Roosevelt and
the race issue as follows: - -

LAMONT, S. D.. Oct. 3D.â A hypnotist

much persuasion gave himself up In con
sideration of the sum of S3 to be taken
through the proposed performance.
"When the time for the lecture arrived
the next evening the little schoolhouse
was packed and scores of people were
standing outside at the' doors and windows
to witness the affair. Young Rasmussen
was taken from his grave and returned
in his coffin to the schoolhous*. He was
then taken out and laid upon the table
where he had undergone the operation of
being placed under a hypnotic influence
the evening before.
The lecturer then proceeded to restore
the young man to consciousness. His first
attempt failed to produce the desired re

the third. After repeated efforts with the
same fruitless results the lecturer became
excited, lost his self-control, fainted and

Mr. Frlede is largely interested in enter
prises in Manchuria and has made many
trips to the Far East during the last sev

This time he decided to come by way of
San Francisco and on his journey he is
accompanied by the members of his fam
ily.
Five years ago Russia entered Manchuria
with a view of developing the country and she
has accomplished in five years what no other
country has ever done. She â¢ undertook the
building of a railroad without regard to its
cost r.nd .successfully accomplished the work
and then proceeded to open the country for
commerce. E\'ery possible encouragement was
offered to foreigners, and especially Americans,
in Manchuria. Russia bought American rails
and locomotives with which to build the Man
churian road, and to-day she does not charge
the American or any other foreigner a cent more
to haul their goods over this road than she
dt*Â« the freight of her own subject*. Five
years ago the whole world . knew, exactly what
Russia proposed to do In the way of developing
Manchuria and civilizing her subjects, yet now,
after she h/is performed this difficult work at
an expenditure of millions of dollars, we. the
American people,' with whom the empire has
always been on the most friendly terms, join
with Japan, a country that has never shown
us the slightest encouragement in a commercial
way. In a demand that Russia get out of Man
churia. It is. according to my way of think
ing, an unfair stand, and certainly un-Ameri
can.
Mr. Frlede is strongly opposed to the
stand taken by the United States in the
present dMHcultles in the Orient. He
finds no reason why we should have
taken sides with Japan. Discussing this
subject, he said: u â¢

finally wonder why they could not get along.
In short, they will not agree to settle down in
their new country like the young men cent out
from Germany and Belgium. It is seldom that
an American will take his family to the Far
East w-ith him. and when he arrives there he
generaJly remarks to his new acquaintances
that he lias simply come over for a trip. By
our indifference the United States is losing a
great deal in a commercial way, a fact which
it will appreciate in years to come.

are "The Oscan and Other Italian Dia

(1871), and an edition of "Justinian's
Pandects" (1866-70). In 1895 he" resigned
his position as perpetual secretary of the
Berlin Academy and retired to his home
at Charlottenberg. Â¦
On the occasion of his seventieth births
day, November, 1SS7, a congratulatory ad
dress signed by sixty-two "Dons" .was
sent to him by members of the University
of Oxford.
In 1878 theKlng of Italy conferred upon
him the Grand Cross of the Order of S.
S. Maurice and Lazarus. In 1SS0 he lost
his library by fire and a number of his
English admirers presented him with a
selection of classical and historical works
in English to compensate him for - his
loss, a gift which he most highly appre
ciated. \\:>- - : Â¦Â¦
Theodore Momnuen, kpown to the civ
ilized world for the last half century as
an eminent jurist and historian, was born
at Gardiner In Schleswigr, November 30,
1817, making: him within four weeks of
being 86 years of age. He- is the son of
a pastor, who being himself a man of
letters, naturally led his boy from an
early ape along the same paths. With a
thorough foundation in the preliminary
studies young Mommsen entered the Uni
versity of Kiel, where he studied some
years; the major part of his time, how
ever, both at the university and at home,
was given to reading historical works
especially.
From 1844 to 1847, after leaving the uni
versity, he traveled in France and Italy
and examined old Roman inscriptions
for the Berlin Academy. On his return he
was a regular contributor to the columns
of the Schleswlg-Holstein Journal, of
which he became conductor, and later
was made professor of law at Lelpsle.
From this position he was dismissed on
account of the part he took in political
affairs, but was eoon after (1S52) -offered
the place of titular professor of law at
Zurich, where he remained for two years,
going from there to Breslau In 1854,. and in
IS58 to the University of Berlin, where he
remained thirteen years. In 1875, his for
mer political offenses - being apparently
forgotten, he was appointed professor of
jurisprudence at Lelpslc.
In 1SS2 he antagonized Prince Bismarck
and in June of that year was tried at
Berlin for having slandered the ' "Iron
Chancellor" in a public speech. He was
acquitted by that court, but the prosecu
tion took an appeal, and on April 7, 1883,
before the Imperial High Court of Ap
peals at Leipslc, Professor Mommsen
was finally acquitted of the charge.
Mommsen's fame as a jurist is fully
equaled by his standing as a historian.
He has written many learned works, in
cluding a magnificent one on Latin In
scriptions (1S46), which was published by
the Prussian Academy of Sciences, and
another of equally rare merit and re
search on Roman coins (1850): He is best
known in English-speaking- countries,
however, by his "Earliest Inhabitants of
Italy," a translation of which by Robert
son appeared in London in 1858, and by
his "History of Rome," translated by W.
P. Dickson and published in London in
1862-63. '

reason why we should not have contlnueu to

that exltl inert wer* readily appreciated by
other countries, who are now well represented
in Manchuria, The Americans are slow in
their enterprise. Take, for Instance, the fruit

wonderful business In Manchuria if they would
only unite in a echerae similar to the one they
have carried out in the Eastern States. There
they have established warehouses, which the*

trade.- The same scheme could be profitably
effected in the Far East. Only a few brands

have shown no Interest In the trade. A. little
enterprise on their part would bring to them a
business that would fteadily increase and re
main within thfir control for years to come.
As a result it was soon discovered that
American exporters were really working un
willingly against, their own interests. Whea

An autopsy performed at thÂ© Morgue
last night by Dr. D. Baclgalupl developed
the fact that death ensued as the result
of degeneration of the heart, liver and
kidneys. As a precautionary measure the
stomach was sent to the City Chemist for
analysis.
According to the neighbors, Mrs. Jor
dan received some money from the United
Railroads for her injuries and it was
ppent for a large quantity of liquor. Mrs.
D. M. Wiggins, who lives in the next
apartments to those occupied by the Jor
dans, states that she never heard any
quarreling or disturbance between hus
band and wife. Jordan was released from
jail last night, but Kate Jordan and the
child were held pending arrangements
with some society for the future care of
the baby. Detectives Ryan and Taylor,
who were detailed on the case, are of the
opinion that the woman died from natur
al causes. ,
Her husband administered a seidlitz
powder to relieve her and yesterday
morning gave her some baking soda. The
woman grew rapidly worse and
Dr. Hickey was summoned, but
before his arrival death had tak
en place. The physician noticed
that the woman's lip was considerably
swollen, as If from a blow, and notified
the Coroner. The body was removed to
the Morgue and upon the statement of the
landlady that Kate Jordan, the sister-in
law, who was nursing a pair of discolored
optics, had told her that Jordan had beat
his wife, the police took him Into cus
tody. Kate Jordan and the four weeks'
old child were also taken to the City
Prison.
Deceased resided with her husband,
John Jordan, a stableman employed by
John Daughney of 814 Folsom street, and
her sister-in-law at 750 Harrison street in
a rooming-house conducted by Mrs. R.
W. Smith. On October 3 Mrs. Jordan
was thrown from u car at Fourth and
Harrison streets and sustained a. lacerat
ed wound on the forehead.' Dr. Hickey was
called to attend her and on the following
day she gave birth to a child. Mother and
child were In good health until Thurs
day night, when the deceased complained
of nausea.
Several suspicious circumstances sur
rounding the death yesterday morning of
Mrs. Mary Jordan of 750 Harrison street
and the fact that the attending physician,
Dr. Hickey of 271 Fourth street, refused
to sign the death certificate, caused the
detectives and Coroner to Investigate her
death.
KEEn CONTESTS
OVER A WILL
It was ascertained that .about three
weeks ago the dead man became engaged
in an altercation with Mrs. M. Grove and
hit her on the head with a chair. The in
jured woman was removed to the French
Hospital for ' treatment and the police
sought her assailant, - but could not *nd
him.
Deceased no doubt believed that he had
committed murder, and, fearing -arrest
and prosecution for his crime, â¢ crawled
into the dark, dismal cellar, where he
ended his life. J. T. Cognet, who claims
to have been the attorney for the dead
man and Mrs. Grove, called at the Morgue
last evening and intimated that there was
something wrong in connection with the
death, but refused to .state upon what
he based his suspicions.
He eaid that Ventajou came to this city
from Oakland two months* ago and fur
nished the house at 1014 Powell street as a
lodging-house, where he took up his resi
dence with, the woman. Detective Wren
made a thorough investigation, but could
find no evidence of a murder having been
committed. : The body was taken to a
local undertaking parlor.
Believing that he had caused the death
of Mrs. M.' Grove, the woman .with whom
he had been living, by a bjow with a
chair and haunted by the fear of Impend
ing arrest, Germain Ventajou, a French
laundryman, betook himself to the cellar
of his house at 1014 Powell street about
three weeks ago and cut his throat from
ear to ear. The body was discovered yes
terday afternoon in an advanced state of
decomposition by G. E. Snook, a plumber,
at 601 Sacramento street, who had gone
to the house with a view of ascertaining
if a sewer pipe was leaking in the base
ment. ' ' ' â¢'
Snook entered the cellar and was al
most overpowered by a horrible stench.
Lying on ttie ground in a corner he came
upon the body of Ventajou. The head
was almost severed from the trunk and a
bloody razor lying a foot from the corpse
bore silent testimony â¢, to the cause of
death. The Coroner's office and Police De
partment were notified and Deputy Cor
oner Brown and Detective Ed Wren made
an investigation.

It will be noted that, although the output of
pig iron from Canadian ore has fallen off, the
whole iron smelting Industry shows marked

industry, an increase of nearly $4,500,000 Is
exhibited.- showing a growth In these, ihe most

eral products for 1002 was $11 87. as compared
with $2 23 in 1836. Â¦ the first year for which
figures are available.
TREATY PROVISIONS. -
Some inquiry has been made by letter
concerning the mining clause in the re
cently negotiated treaty between the
United States and China. The under
standing is that the United States, under
the most favored nation clause, will be
entitled to the same privileges in China
as were accorded to Great Britain. Last
year Great Britain and China signed a
treaty in which was the following rela
tive to mining: .- ' . "
The Chtpese Government, recognizing that it
is advantageous for the country to develop its
mineral resources, and that It Is desirable to
attract foreign as well as Chinese capital to
embark in mining enterprises, agree' within
one year from the Bijrnlnsr of this treaty to
initiate and conclude the revision of the exist
ing: mining regulations. China will, with all ex
pedition Â¦ and earnestness, go Into the whole
question of mining rules, and. selecting from
the rules of Great Britain." India and other
countries regulations which seem applicable to
the condition of China, she will) recast her
present mining rules in such a way as, while
promoting the Interests of Chinese subjects and
not injuring in any way the sovereign rights
of China, shall offer no impediment to the at
traction of foreign capital or place foreign
capitalists - at a greater disadvantage flan
they would be under generally accepted foreign
regulations. Any mining concession granted
after the publication of these new rules shall
be subject to their provisions. .
The. general understanding of this Is
that China is ready and egrees to extend
mining privileges to Great Britain such
as are accorded in Australia and Mexico.
Rules and regulations to enable British
subjects to mine in China are under con
sideration! Very little exact knowledge'
is had of the mineral resources of the
Flowery Kingdom. There are lmportnat
coal fields in Shansi and Hunan; also
copper, lead and tin ores in other locali
ties: gas and oil wells have been discov
ered; there are silver mines in Mongolia,
and gold diggings in the country near the
Amobr River.
The miners' bureau of the Canadian
Geological Survey reports the output ! of
Canadian mines for the year 1902. The
metallic substances, gold, copper, iron
ore," lead, nickel," silver, zinc, etc, reached
a total value of $35,653,768. The more val
uable products were gold, to the amount
of $20,741,245, of which all but $6,241,245
came from the Yukon country. The cop
per value was $4,553,000; nickel, $5,000,000;
silver, $2,2SO,000. The non-metallic sub
stances total for the year $21,245,091. The
coal output was $15,533,000 of this, or
more than the value of the Yukon gold.
A part of the report. is as follows:
Quicksilver In Oregon supplies the basis
of some comment in the Engineering and
Mining Journal. Some statements are*
made in the journal mentioned that will
Interest the miners of Northern Califor
nia. For instance, it Is asserted that
there is a zone in California and Oregon
that is 600 miles long in which the forma
tion is favorable to the ' discovery of
quicksilver. The mineral has been found
as far south as Texas and as far north as
Oregon.
About thirty-five years ago. It is assert,
ed, cinnabar was found near the head of
the Little Applegate River, on the north
west slope of Slskiyou peak, in the south
ern part of Jackson County, Oregon. A
furnace was constructed and a man
named Mullen tried in a crude way to re
duce the. ores. The escape of mercurial
fumes salivated his employes, . and he,
having very little money, was compelled
to abandon the experiment. Cinnabar has
also been met with in the region of Evan3
Creek, a tributary to ' the Rogue River,
about twenty miles northeast from Gold
Hill, on the Oregon and California Rail
read.
The authority Is W. R. Dennis. Accord
ing to the statements quicksilver la found
on Calapooia Creek, Douglas County,
eight miles east of the, town of' Oakland,
where two mines were opened some years
ago. There ! are â¢ outcroppings of cinnabar
on a branch of Elkhead . Creek, where
there is a. mine which is credited with
having produced about $30,000 worth of
quicksilver. Four miles east of the Elk
head mine a deposit has been located In
what is styled in the article the "Black
Butte quicksilver district."
All the cinnabar deposits that have been
mentioned are on the westerly slope of
the Cascade range of mountains. No cin

Right here we want to explain that piano

Many, people seem imbued with the idea
that because the Wiley B. Allen Co. has such
magnificent quarters right in the heart of the

high-priced pianos. But such is not the case,
for we are offering and selling right along a

$135.00. We challenge any one to find a
better piano for this sum of money in San
Francisco.

Then we always have on hand what we
term "Specials." How would you like a fine,
large, concert Grand piano ? We have oneâ a
Steinwayâ price $485.00. We took this
piano up from a leading conservatory, who
have introduced in its stead the Everett.
How would you like a fine new Chicker-

one, $400.00. We took it from a musical
directress, who bought it a few days before
we received it in part payment for an Everett ;
and speaking of the Everett, let us assure you
it is the ideal piano of the century. It is, of
course, high-priced, but mighty good.

To the police Editor Kureghian of
Young Armenia stated that Krikorian is
â¢the head of the London central commit
tee and it was he who ordered Kureg
hian's murder and attempted personally
to assassinate him several months ago
when he was editing a paper In London.
LONDON, Oct. 30.â At the headquarters
of the Armenian revolutionists at Peck
ham, a suburb of this city, it is believed
that Vahlan Krikorian, who was arrested
at Boston yesterday on the arrival of the
steamer Ivernia, charged with having
been Implicated In the conspiracy which
resulted In the assassination of Sagouni.
Is probably identical with < the Armenian
of that name who, with two others, Ivor
nla Shamian and Krikorian, seceded three
months ago and set up, a rival society at
Clapham, another suburb of London,
where the Alfarista assembled. These
three men are said to ha.ve disappeaied
in August and some thought r they *had
gone to Cyprus. Krikorian, who : was for
merly an Armenian Protestant preacher,
Is reported to have been hostile to Sagouni
since the split of the society in 1902.

during his voyage to this country Sagotel
Sagouni had been murdered, demanded to
know on what charge he was held. On
being told that he was charged with be
ing a fugitive from justice because of
having committed "political murder,"
Krikorian demanded proof. This the
Commissioner was unable to give at this
time, and asked Krikorian to plead. Kri
korian pleaded "not guilty." Pending the
arrival of direct charges Krikorian was
sent back to the jail.

the Santa Fe train In Colorado, said:
"I have no information at hand which
enlightens me in the least as to the mo
tive of the parties who wrecked the train
by drawing the spikes and joints for a
distance of three rail lengths at the ap
proach of the bridge. As far as our
knowledge gees, there was no attempt
at robbery following the ditching of the
train and It would seem that the act
was purely malicious. I will leave for
Colorado to-morrow morning and will go
Into the matter thoroughly."

report, the money was being transported

laid about a year ago.
But for the accident of a hot box on
the express car a large amount of money
would have been In the safe on the

the plunder the desperadoes hoped to se
cure. Valises were rifled by the robbers

ASTORIA, Or., Oct. 30.â Captain Trlxa
dor of the French bark Germaine reports
having witnessed off the Columbia River
a sanguinary contest between a monster
black fish or whale and a savage sword
fish. The battle raged for fully an hour
and ended in the death of the whale. The
fight was in progress when the ship came
close enough to enable the crew to watch
the battle. The swordflsh was the ag
gressor throughout and the. efforts of the
whale to get away from him proved fu
tile. The swordflsh repeatedly leaped into
the air with the intention of sinking his
sharp sword Into the back of his huge
antagonist, but the whale succeeded In
evading these attacks. However, the
sword cut ugly gashes In the sides of the
whale and the sea was red with blood.
Occasionaly the fighting monsters sank
from sight, but the battle waged beneath
the surface of the water. After an hour's
fighting the swordflsh finally succeeded In
driving his sword deep into the back of
the whale and the leviathan succumbed,
the body floating motionless on the ocean.
At times during the progress of the bat
tle the Germaine was within a cable's
length of the contestants, but they were
eo interested in their fight that the pres
ence of the ship was not heeded.

INDORSEMENT
FOR
RECORDER.
"VVhen a public offlclaJ has b**n tried and
found true to his trust: when the affairs of hi*
office have been honestly, efficiently and eco-
nomically administered. It- la apparent to all
that public duty ard public Interest should
unite to retain him In the position he has cred-
itably filled. If proper recognition is denied
the official who has been honest and capable,
the implication follows that the. people appre-
ciate neither honesty nor capability in the pub-
!lc service. But right thinking citizens do not
willingly make this mistake. Who Is the wor-
thy candidate? That U the question.
With full knowledge of the facts, we destre
to comiriend the administration of Recorder Ed-
monel Godchaux. and to certify to the Improve-
orient In that department during his term. ThÂ»
superlcr conditions that now exist and the
prompt service and courteous treatment accord-
ed the public are a matter of common comment
to all who have regular dealings with the Re-
corder's office.
The financial showing U equally rrattryinjr:
During 1 the three years of Mr. Godchaux' Â¦
term the otflce has paid expenses and earned a
net surplus of $23,309 19 for the city treasury.
During the three years preceding his adminis-
tration the office was conducted at a loss, pro-
ducing a net deficit of $24.s;u 73. This is *
gain of 143.113 02 for the present management,
credit belQK equally due tha charter and thÂ«
Recorder.
As tha wise employer does honor to his faith*
ful assistant, so should the people reward thoaw
public servants who have proved that they may
be trusted. In tha Interest of clean and capa-
ble municipal service, without regard to parti-
san considerations, we Indorse Mr. Godchaux
for Recorder. Respectfully submitted.

â¢ Sometimes Help the Hair to Go.
In any changeable climate the hair Is
â¢ apt to become brittle and to break off
Ftubby here and there. This makes a
hair dressing almost a necessity, espe-
â¢ cially to ladles. In using a hair dressing
why not get the best, one that combines
with it the efficiency In killing the dan-
' druff germ, the germ that eats the hair
off at the roots, causing what Is called
falling hair, and in time baldness. New-

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30.â For several
days Miss Bessie Barclay, the 16-year-old

missing from home and as she had made
previous efforts to go on the stage against
the consent of her parents, detectives in
various cities were asked to watch the
theatrical agencies and other efforts were
made to locate her with small traveling
troupes in this part of the State. To-night
just before the steamer Ruth sailed from
San -Pedro for San Francisco the 'captain
of the vessel happened to notice that the
hair of a newly engaged cabin-boy ap
peared to be rather long and as If by ac
cident the captain knocked off the young
ster's cap. The result amazed * him, - for
over the shoulders . of the supposed boy
fell a wealth of. golden hair which could
belong only to a girl. The supposed boy
was the missing girl. The captain at once
notified the shore authorities and a Los
Angeles detective went to San Pedro and
brought the girl home. â¢ Â«

DENVER, Oct. 30.â It is practically cer
tain that Brigadier General John Chase,
commander of the National Guard of
Colorado, now on trial before a court
martial, will be exonerated from tha
charge of perjury. When the court met
to-day it was announced that no further
evidence on thl3 charge would be re
quired and a recess was taken until this
afternoon at the request of General
Chase's attorneys to give the defendant
further time to arrange his defense to
the charges of disobedience and insubor
dination. A member of the court, on be
ing asked for his opinion of the signif
icance of the abrupt closing of the hear
ing on the perjury charge, replied that It
amounted practically to an acquittal.
This afternoon General Chase was put
upon the stand. He admitted refusing to
obey the alleged executive order for the
release of the prisoner, Davis. He de
clared that he had been made responsible
for the peace of the Cripple Creek dis
trict and felt that the detention of Davis ;
was necessary. He did not believe the
order came from the Governor. He de
nied that he had ever willfully disobeyed
any order which he knew came from the
commander In chief, Governor Peabody.

WASHINGTON 1 . Oct. 30.â The War
Department to-day made public the re
port and findings In -the case of Major
Robert L. ' Howze, charged with cruelty
in the Philippines. The findings of 'the
board exonerate Major Howze, who was
then lieutenant colonel, commanding the
district where the alleged cruelties took
place. This part of the findings Is ap
proved by the War Department. The sec
ond part of the findings declared that al
though Major Hunter, who made the
first Investigation, was unfriendly to Ma
"jor Howze the Investigation was fairand
impartial so far as it extended. The de
partment disapproves this portion of the
findings "as contradictory in terms and
unwarranted by the evidence elicited by
the board during the progress of its in
vestigation." : ..
The whole matter was the subject of
exhaustive .investigation and report some
months ago, and on account. of the con
flicting testimony Secretary Root con
vened a board which met at Laoag, P. I.,
on July 14, and before which both Howze

NEOPHYTES DO
TRITE "STUNTS"
CRUELTY CHARGE
IS DISPROVED
With Its capital exhausted, however,
the company is bt-ing regarded as rather
doub'tful by the Mexican people, who are
now anxiously awaiting news from abroad
coricernmg the success of Stllwell's finan
cial ventures there.
''The. Stilwell syndicate started out by
purchasing 125 miles of right of way be
longing to the Chihuahua and Pacific
Railroad, which is owned and operated
t>y .an Eastern company. Then abtut
twenty-five miles of track were laid east
ward-from Chihuahua and the depot.? and
parr of the Chihuahua and Pacific tracks
vver.e rented for temporary terminal pur
Â£>ot4-s. The plans were to build the road
between Kansas City and Chihuahua
first. â¢ From the latter city to Topolobam
po it was purposed to build as nearly as
possible on a straight line, starting con
struction work at both ends. The 125 miles
of ,*febt of way purchased from the Chi
huahua and Pac'tic formed part of this
route to the west and it was mainly nlor.g
this* portion of the roa'd that Stilwell and
his 'railroad associates denounced all
kinds of .mineral properties with the evi
<tent purpose of strengthening their claim
tyiat'the road carried with it rich assets
besides its lines of tracks.
WOBKING WITH VIGOR.
From tlm<? to time the United States
was' furnished with glowing reports of
the progress being made in the construc
tioB of the Kansas City, Mexican and
Orient road, and up to a few months ago
the f>eople of this country had reason to
believe that the road was being built as
last as the material could be obtained
fr<tm the overworked mills in the East.
Suddenly, however, reports began to be
received here that work had slackened
down", and then came the news that Stil
well had gone to Europe. The news from
Mexico is to the effect that his visit to
the other side is for the purpose of secur
ing, more capital to replenish depleted
coffers. Meanwhile it is said that the
workmen have not be^n paid by the con
tractors for . the reason that the latter
ha>e"not been reimbursed under the con
ditions of their contracts.
One of the first moves made by Stil
well was' to erase the name Topolobampo
from the map and substitute it with that
Of. Port Stilwell. To this change Presi
dent Diaz interposed a prompt objection,
explained to the enterprising Stilwell
that 'while the Mexican Government had
no Â¦ Objection to Americans adding . new
names to the map of the republic, the
latter would not permit its old Spanish
navies to be abolished.
Tbe proposition to build a road from
Kansas City to the Mexican coast by way
of Chihuahua when first announced sev
eral years ae-o attracted considerable at
tention in this country as well as the
Southern republic, for ft was regarded as
an enterprise that would result in the
tspenlng of a large and valuable mining
aistrict of Mexico and furnish eventually
i. new and interesting route for passen
ger traffic between the . two countries.
Stilwell obtained a small amount of capi
tal, for the undertaking in Kansas City
and a larger sum In Holland and England
trith which he began his preliminary work
.for the construction of the road. From
the Mexican Government he obtained a
number of concessions and it was not
long before the announcement was made
that rails were being shipped to the pro
posed western terminus of the line, along
which were supposed to lie valuable gold
and copper properties, some of them be
longing to the Stilwell people.
â¢â¢"â¢ -Â¦ CHANGES NAME.
.Private advices received In this city
from Mexico state that the opinion exists
la the Northern States of the Republic
that the plans for the construction 'of
whKt is known as the Kansas City, Mexi
co and Orient road, a project promoted
by E. A. Stilwell of Kansas City and de
signed to connect the latter city with To
polobampo, on the Gulf of California
Coast,' is not going to mature.
If the- report is true the contractors
who' have been building the few miles of
rosd westward from Chihuahua, Mexico,
have not been paid and the company Is
long overdue Jn its rental for a portion of
*he tracks and depots of the Chihuahua
<ind Pacific Railroad and is falling behind
in its various other undertakings which
were consjdered part of the Stilwell en
terprise.
PHILADELPHIA
HAS BIG FIRE
It fa announced that the Santa Fe, sys
tem will erect two depots in the mission
style of architecture, one at the corner
of Fortieth street and San Pablo avenue,
for Oakland, and the other at the cross
ing of University avenue and the Santa
Fe extension in Berkeley. The Oakland
depot will cost $15,000, and the Berkeley
depot will cost just half that sum. The
sites have already bern secured and work
will begin at once.

The plan is that three main line electric
trains will diverge from Emeryvilleâ one
to Berkeley, one to Piedmont and one
down San Pablo avenue to Oakland.
Owing to the fact that the track to Pied
mont is not complete and that there are
not cars enough to operate either this line
or the San Pablo, avenue line, the new
6jstem has been compelled to begin its
operations with the Berkeley line alone.
It Is expected that the cars for the San
Pablo avenue' linÂ© will arrive soon, and
until they do a single car will leave the
corner of Fourteenth street and Broad
way every hour. In time to connect with
the boat at the end of the Emeryville pier.
The Piedmont line Is being pushed as
rapidly as possible, and on Sunday next
it will be put in operation as far as Tele
graph avenue. It will be nearly December
1 before it is put in operation through to
Piedmont.
The next main line electric train to be
established will be that on San 'Pablo ave
nue. It will leave the corner of Four
teenth street and Broadway in time to
make stops at Twenty-first, Twenty-sev.
enth and Thirty-fourth streets, and will
then run straight down the long pier
without stopping at the junction at For
tieth street. This will be the run to give
rapid transit to the center of Oakland,
where the new ferry system will be In
close competition with the old ferry lines.
The Oakland Transit Company, which Is
the street car system of the new ferry
route, announces that It will operate its
Telegraph avenue line through to North
Berkeley, instead of stopping at Berkeley
station.
The new "key route" ferry system from
Emeryville is extending its lines very
slowly,, but it is expected that by Decem
ber everything will be in complete opera
tion. Meanwhile the new ferry will de
pend upon transient travel and single trip
tickets for its support, The regular com
mutation tickets will not be placed on sale
until December.

Rearing and plunging among a number
of vehicles, a horse driven, by Miss Mary
Mathews overturned a phaeton on San
Pablo avenue this evening and threw tha
driver and Misses Bessie and Irene Ma
her out Into the street. But for the> pres
ence of mind of T. C. Connell, a pas
senger on a passing car. who jumped and
caught the horse, all would probably have
been dragged to death. As it was the
yuong ladies escaped with a few bruises.
Miss Mathews was driving from Oak
land to her home at Fortieth street and
San Pablo avenue and had with her thÂ«
two little daughters of Dr. J. Maher, her
neices, aged 9 and 12 years respectively.
They had reached where the new electric
train crosses the road and where a num
ber of other vehicles were waiting tha
passing of the train. The horse becamo
impatient and began to rear and plungo
and finally backed the phaeton Into an
other rig and upset it. The young ladles
were tangled in the overturned phaeton
and Mr. Cennell jumped from a passing
car and caught the animal by the- bit and
succeeded in qiueting It and allowed tha
frightened occupants to extricate them

Several accident cases were treated at
the Receiving Hospital . to-day. Louis
Elke, a tinsmith's Â¦ apprentice, was
brought In this afternoon with a broken
jaw. A horse had kicked him and caused
such^a fracture that his face had to be
put In a plaster of parts cast, and this
will necessitate his taking nourishment
through a tube for, some. time. ,
Felix Filippini, a worker in a macaroni
factoryat 513 Fifth street, unfortunately
caught his leg In some of the machinery
this afternoon and it was drawn in until
the bones were broken In four places.
Fortunately the machinery stopped owing
to, the obstruction, or he would have met
a horrible death. He was taken to the
hospital, where all was done to put him
on" the way to recovery, but It Is feared
that the leg will have to be amputated.
Thomas McLean, an employe of the Cal

Louis Thors. Colonel Taber. O. H. Boye,
Joseph F. Mullender; George F. Kelly, po
lice photographer, and Lawrence F. Ter.
kelson of the Bushnell gallery provided a
feast of entertainment for the guests. . :
Every photographic studio In: San "Fran
cisco was closed yesterday and the em
ployes were Invited to partake of the
pleasure of the bay excursion and they
responded with a good will.
Captain Leale of the Caroline took his
passengers along the water front and
gave them an opportunity of seeing the
docks, the Union Iron Wprks and the
Spreckels Sugar Refinery. Then the ves
sel was headed toward the Golden Gate
and the .fun commenced. Hats were sent
flying overboard by the blasts of wind
and a number of the ladies succumbed
to the rolling of the vessel. A bounteous
supply of refreshments had been supplied
for the visitors and those* who were not
overcome by the waves had a pleasant
time. Alcatraz and Angel islands, Tib
uron and Sausali to were Inspected and the
return trip was made along â¢ the : water
front from Meiggs wharf to the Jackson-
Btreet wharf. A large number of photo
graphs were taken en route and the
weather was ideal for the work of the
camera. . \
At 1 p. m. yesterday the members of the
association with their friends, to the num
ber of about two hundred, boarded the
steamer Caroline for a trip around the
bay. It is no exaggeraton to say that the
points of Interest around the harbor had
never before been so frequently "shot."
There were enough cameras and kodaks
aboard the Caroline to stock a good-sized
store and the 'photographers gave them
selves up to a thoroughly pleasant after
noon.
TAKE TRIP AROUND BAY.
Shades of all colors were produced in th e
photographic prints and delicate tints
were exhibited as the result of the demon-
Etrations. The members of the association
asked many questions of the demonstra
tor and the technical queries were an
swered in a satisfactory manner. Owing
to the plans of the convention commit
tee calling for an excursion on the bay
the demonstration of the use of rotograph
bromide printing papers was postponed
until this morning.
Time is an important element with the
gentlemen who manipulate the camera
and following this proverb the members
of the association were promptly on hand
when the second day of the convention's
proceedings commenced yesterday morn
ing at 9 o'clock in the art gallery of the
Mechanics' Pavilion.
The morning session was devoted to
demonstrations of the use of -American
Aristo printing papers by Ira H. Latour.
Dozens of photographs were taken and
the negatives were quickly developed.
Then the negatives were used with various
grade of the Aristo paper and the re
sults were declared by experts to be thor
oughly artistic. i - . Â¦'->
PLEASURE and business were

Governor Toole said nothing had yet
been 1 outlined and no plans had been ar
' ranged.
Sehator Clark later called on Governor
Toole and the Senator then drove the
Governor to his home. A committee from
the Butte Business Men's Association
called on the Senator at his home and
requested that a time be set for a con-
with the committee en mediation.
After" a short stay the committee went
. io :Senator Ciark's office In the Miner
"^ul'dJng- and immediately got down to
â¢business. The committee remained in ses
sion all afternoon in secret conference
â¢"and nothing was given out. At 5 o'clock
' -the committee took a recess and at 7
-o'clock t.he party were the guests of Sen
ator Clark at dinner. In the meantime
'.Mr. Heinze was invited to meet with the
"committee at S:30. As far as known Pres
ident Scallon of the Anaconda Company
'had not yet met the committee
â¢ It. was Etated that President Hill ex
pected to go East to-morrow. The com
mittee of fifteen named at the mass
'.me*ting held at the Auditorium Thurs
day . night under the auspices of the
Trades and Labor Assembly will prob
ably meet Governor Toole somo time to
"racrrow. The committee will ask Mon
tana's chief executive to call an extra
Eession of the Legislature for the purpose
pf considering needed legislation. A sub
" committee will see the Governor to-mor
row, when a final appointment Is ex
pected to be made for the meeting: with
â¢the general committee.
. To a representative of the Associated
Press Senator Clark said nothing beyond
the fact that the committee had organized
by" electing Mr. Hill chairman of the com
mittee had been accomplished. The situa
tion had been discussed informally and
the committee wanted to have a talk with
3Jr-. Heinze to see what could be done in
fixing' up matters.
Senator Clark said there was nothing
to give out for publication at the present
lime, as the committee had not decided
es yet on any plan of procedure.
. Ttrere were all sorts of rumors afloat, but
pone of them had any foundation in fact.
There' were rumors that Governor Toole
had. decided to call an extra session of
vhe -Legislature, but this was only street
tajk.
Senator Gibson favored a plan to have
the -mines start up at once on the proviso
that r.o receiver should be appointed pend
ing â¢ the determination of the Injunction
by the Supreme Court: that the Legis
lature should enact a law, in special ses.-
Ei'on. legalizing the existence of the
Amalgamated Company.
.Of course these are only street rumors
and nothing authentic has come from the
committee. . It was not expected that any
thing official would tÂ»e announced until
a late hour.
â¢ The m-embers of the committee were
tbe "ruests of Senator Clark and they
lunched and dined at his home. At 9
o'clock this evening P. Augustus Heinze
called at Senator Clark's house by invita
tion and met the members of the commit
ted. There was a cordial hanCshakine all
aro.ifnd. The gentlemen or the committee
wene etill sitting at the table when Mr.
â¢Heinle called and when he was announced
the dinner party broke up and all came
b'u-t .to meet him.
â¢ 'The .men composing: the committee are

IS AR BUTTE
Vancouver's History of
Voyage Leads to
Decision.
Members of Alaskan Boun
dary Commission Arrive
at New York.
former Senator Turner of Washington,
another member of the tribunal, was not
willing to discuss how the agreement
came to be reached, but he admitted that
the decision Kivinsr two islands in the
Portland Canal to: the United Stafes was
based on Vancouver's narrative of his
voyage of exploitation. The question
hinged on whether he had called the wa
ter to the south of the islands the chan
nel, or whether he had gone to the
north of them. It was found that he
would have gone from the entrance into
a point of land above the islands some
time. To do this it was figured that
he entered the broad channel, followed
it up and turned In between two islands.
This led the commissioners to decide that
the two islands lying near the mouth of
the canal and opposite Port Simpson be
longed to the United States.
Mr. 'Turner admitted that this was true.
Speaking of these two islands, he said:
"The islands are of very little value to
us, except from a strategical standpoint.
I. believe that the new transcontinental
railroad which is to be built north of the
Canadian Pacific will have Port Simpson
for its terminal. This makes the islands
of importance to Canada."
Touching a report that it is charged
(hat Lord Alverstone had been practically
won over by kindness, the ex-Senator said
he did not think such a thing could be.
"The question to be settled," said he,
"was one of right under the international
law, and Lord Alverstone, who is an ac
tive Jurist settled the case on Its merits."
Mr. Turner regarded it as fortunate that
the commission was able to agree and he
considered it a step forward in the set
tlement of all future disputes.
, NEW YORK,* Oct. 30.-On account of
his official connection with the Alaskan
Boundary Tribunal, Senator Lodge of
Massachusetts declined to discuss the
award of, the tribunal on his arrival here
to-day by the steamer Cedric. Senator
Lodge said the members of the tribunal
had been very handsomely treated | while
in- London. He refused to say anything
about tjie attitude of the Canadian com
missioners in refusing to sign the award.
.Joseph Pope, representative of the Ca
nadian Government and one of the assist
ants of the tribunal, who was also on
the Cedric, said that the award was of
course disappointing from the Canadian
point of view,' but offered no further com
ment, appearing anxious, however, to as
certain how the decision'' had been re
ceived in Canada.
. DUBUQUE, Iowa, Oct. 30.â The charred
bones of Justus Harwlgr, a prominent citi

of a barrel near Volga City to-day. The
skull had been fractured. It is believed
that Harwie was murdered.

be rockets, red fire, oratory, music and
marching columns: The Republicans
everywhere In the city get assurances
from their neighbors and friends that
Democrats, perceiving that Lane stands
no chance of winning. Intend to vote for
Henry J. Crocker. Republicans are elated
over the verified news that Schmitz is
losing ' ground. . The so-called Schmitz
meetings last - night ' were deficient In
numbers and character. '... The swing of
strength : to Crocker will " carry quite a
strong following of wage-earners.
, The city water front saw the biggest
time yesterday at the noon , hour that It
has known In years. J[t was the occasion
of one great, glorious. ' rousing jollifica
tion for Henry J.' , Crocker and the other
Republican candidates. The laboring
man who wasn't for Crocker didn't seem
to be on the face of the globe.
"Cale Coakley of the Dewey' House and
Charley ' Mitchell "of the Beach, assisted
by some of the young workers of the dis
trict, were the prime movers In the great
success. Long tables were spread in the
basement of the Dewey dining-room and

SIGNALS OF VICTORY.
choice for Treasurer, was 'In the rear of
the hall and was called to the platform
by Chairman Tolle. In an instant the tall
form of the popular candidate was ob
served by the assemblage and the cheers
that filled the hall proved the popuarity
of the incumbent of the office. In the
course of his speech, Mr. McDougald said:
"R is gratifying to a nominee of the
Republican party to" attend the various
meetings and see the intelligence it has
brought forth and to listen to the good
things said of the pr:/ty. We know the
Republican party is a progressive party.
It is a good thing to know that the labor-
Ing element can go to Republicans for
assistance, and it would be better for
them if they would only adhere to the
principles of tht Republican party. It is
the wish of all mei. to see labor advance,
and the only way It can advance is to
have the confidence of our capitalists. I
believe in a strict adherence to Republi
can principles. I know what I am talk
ing about, because I was a laboring man
for thirty years. I cut stone, and by rea
son of the policy of the Republican party
I got good work and good pay. I at
tribute it to the party that controls the
destinies of this country and which will
be successful at' the polls on â¢ Tuesday
next." (Applause.)
Mecton C. Allen was the next speaker,
and he proved a splendid talker. Mr. Al
len told some clever stories that fitted the
occasion, and he aroused a great deal of
laugnter. "This is a Republican year." he
said, "and if you all be not Republicans
this is the time to get aboard the Repub
lican band wagon. We are playing union
music and with union bands, and the tune
is victory."
APPEAXS TO VOTERS.
Mr. Allen appealed to the voters of San
Francisco to stand by the Republican
ticket. He spoke . in behalf of General
Salomon, JoHn J. Grelf and George W.
Dietterle, and also paid a high tribute to
Henry J. Crocker, the standard-bearer of
the party. -; , - .
When Mr. Allen concluded his Bpeech
Henry J. ; Crocker entered the hall, and
the applause was deafening. Enthusiasts
stood up and yelled loudly for the popular
nominee. Mr. Crocker ascended the plat
form and waa immediately presented to
the waiting audience. He spoke in part as
follows:;
"I thank you for this reception. I. have
come from the Richmond District. I have
appeared before six audiences this even
ing and made six speeches : (applause)/
and I want to ask you if I look like a
ghost. I have been withdrawn from pub
lic view; I have been buried by the oppo
sition, and here I am. (Laughter and
applause.) They' say I am one of the
kind of people that don't stay dead. Well,-

The meeting closed N with cheers for Hen
ry J. Crocker and the ticket. The vice
presidents of the meeting follow:
"For twenty-six years I have been a
workingman. Twenty-six years ago my
father told me I had finished schooling
and must go to work and earn my own
living as he did. I had to give up all
hope of going to Yale and getting a col
lege education, and I am mighty \ glad,
ladles and gentlemen, that he cut out the
work for me, because it did me a great
deal. of good. It brought me into the
friendship of people who like myself were
working for a. living. It gave me an un
derstanding of the hearts of the common
people. I was brought up to know that
it was the most gentlemanly thing to be
a workingman. (Applause.) And If I
have succeeded a little beyond those with
whom I worked with It is not because I
have not been willing to help them along
too. I had made my mind up twenty-six
years ago that if I could not go to col
lege I would try to make a mark for an
intimate friend, whom I knowâ Henry J.
Crocker. (Applause.)
"The honor is not mine in accepting this
nomination. I take the honor from you.
You are the people who are- going to em
ploy me for the next two years. My busi
ness is closed and I can afford to give it
up for the good of the city of San Fran
cisco. I now propose that if you elect me
Mayor of San Francisco I will give you
in return for that election all the business
ability, all the business Integrity and all
the good fellowship that I possess and all
I have gained among you. I will return It
two-fold. (Applause.)
"They have called me an aristocrat and
a steam beer campaigner. I accept the
charge. As an aristocrat I will be a gen
tleman In office. (Applause.) As a steam
beer campaigner, I suppose they mean
that I am a fairly good fellow, and if I
am you will not have to see another man
when you go to the Mayor's officeâ you
will not have to go to a side place to
know how the Mayor stands and how
much It will cost you to get there." (Ap
plause.)
of commissioners to preside over the dis
tribution of the city's business that I
will select men who I know will do you
Justice. I will take them from the ranks
of the people and place them where they
arÂ© best fitted to preside, and I know,
ladles and gentlemen, that they will do
me ihe honor by filling their positions in
an honorable manner, and I promise to
give the people of San Francisco a wise,
just and good representation for the
next two years. (Applause.)

. The speaker aroused a great deal of
laughter by I announcing that he " had at
tended a ; meeting [ held : by Franklin ' K.
Lane at noon yesterday and . said It < was
held in a deserted . bank. . : He told "of the
presence : of business i men, lawyers, 1 doc
tors, stockbrokers "and <. capitalists, and
told how Lane had accused them of being
Republicans Â¦; Â¦ and ." then ;* metaphorically
slapped them, on the. wrist and sent them
home with the admonition that they. must
vote for him. He drew a' fanciful picture
Brusie brought out the fact that Sena
tor Stanford and - Senator Hearst were
rich' men who had done much good for the
State. He said that George Washington
was, the richest man of his time, and he
further said that Theodore Roosevelt was
a wealthy man, and yet that. did not pre
vent them from rising to high positions
and having their names enscrolled on' the
pages of their country's history.
CAUSES I, ATJGHTEB.
side of the meeting you will do everything
in your power to help Henry J. Crocker
to victory (applause), and this Is the way
it must be. There must be a change. We
are forming a new and greater San Fran
cisco, a city worthy of the position it oc
cupies in the United States. We must
make a city of this municipality here on
the Pacific Coast that will overshadow
anything on the coast. It must go ahead,
but it cannot be done under such an ad
ministration as it has had lately. It must
be governed by honesty, Intelligence and
integrity." The man who has been placed
at the head of this ticket can do it. He
has been surrounded by men who will as
sist him in giving you an honest adminis
tration." (Applause.)
J. C. Brusie, one of the cleverest cam
paigners in the party, was introduced as
the next speaker. He took up a patriotic
theme brought out . by" .the previous
speaker and developed it with great skill.
"Following out the line of thought sug
gested by General Salomon," he said,
"while it Is true that our nation's safety
and security is always found in the re
sponse which is made by volunteers, we
all know that victories are won and real
strength comes to us In war through the
efforts and energies and the fighting qual
ities of the regular army. , (Applause.)
The barrack force of a common nation
constitutes Its force. The barrack force
of any nation, constitutes . its strength,
and what is true from that national rela
tion is true when' we come . to potent
forces, political. And such an organiza
tion as the Bear Club, when It comes to
a fight in the field, gives. to us a valuable
support.
"I -congratulate the Republican ticket,
I congratulate the " Republican party, I
congratulate the city of San Francisco,
upon the participation of that stal
wart band of Republicans which
has brought more than one < victory
to the party and which will bring us an
other victory next Tuesday. (Applause.).
If there ever" was a time In the history
of the country when Republicans should
take off their coats and fight for a. vic
tory that must be won, that time is right
now. .If there was ever a time when the
good name of San Francisco should be
saved, when the Republican ticket should
prevail, that time Is right now. There
never was a better ticket. You never had
more energetic men. You never had a
truer lot of men from the head of the
ticket to the end than you have now. %Vnd
what a chance to do what Is right!
"Of all the endeavors being made .by
newspapers that are trying to belittle our
standard-bearer, to bring out some charge
or some reason why he is not entitled to
the confidence of his people, they have
only discovered one disqualification and
that Is he belongs to the class : of rich
men." ' ' -\_ t . . ...
Â« "I will not detain you long,'.'. he[ said.
"I say to you I always feel at home In a
Republican meeting.' I'know you are here
with the earnest intention' of helping and
assisting a good cause. It: testifies your
loyalty to the party, and I know that out-
"It shall be my pleasure If It is my
good fortune to be elected in conjunction
with Mr. Crocker, who will be our next
Mayor (applause), to assist him In hand
ling the affairs of San Francisco and to
assist him in untangling the legal points
that will arise In the expenditure of the
millions of dollars for public Improve
ments. I shall strive to perform those
duties in an honorable manner and with
out fear or favor." (Applause.)
General Salomon, the veteran soldier,
who is the Republican party's choice for
the office of District Attorney, was the
next speaker. This eloquent speaker al
ways charms his auditors by his eplendld
speeches. They are full of patriotic sen
timents and always arouse . great enthu
siasm. The general won, his spurs In the
war of the rebellion and came out of that
terrible conflict a brigadier general. He
was appointed Governor of Washington
Territory by President Lincoln and has
held other positions of prominence in the
Federal and State governments. He is a
leading member of the Bear Club and his
friends are working lndefatlgably to
bring about his election. His reception
last night was a warm onÂ© and he-repaid
his friends with a short but brilliant ad
dress. He told of presenting the Bear
Club's banner that had been carried
through victorious campaigns and he
prophesied that It would be carried to
victory next Tuesday by the organization.
FEELS AT HOME.
"It affords me great pleasure to appear
before this honorable club to-night. I
appear before you as a candidate for re
election as Supervisor of San Francisco.
I not only Bpeak for myself, but I ask
you to support the Republican ticket from
top to bottom. It will --be a victory to
elect Henry J. Crocker Mayor! (Ap
plause). But, gentlemen, to strengthen
the Mayor and show what the Republican
party can do, you must elect a Board of
Supervisors with it. With Henry J.
Crocker in the chair and a Republican
Board of Supervisors behind him I will
wager that you will say at the end of
the termâ well done. I ask you one and
all to stand by that ticket and we will
carry that Republican banner on Novem
ber 3 to a grand victory." (Great ap
plause.)
The Orpheus quartet, an organization
composed of young Republicans with
good voices, rendered some sweet refrains,
after which Percy V. Long, the popular
candidate for City Attorney, was intro
duced.' When the applause had subsided
Mr. Long spoke In part as follows:
"It Is a distinct pleasure to me to ap
pear before you to-night, because I know
that the Bear Club has ever taken a deep
interest in the success of the Republican
party. It has been manifest heretofore
in national and State campaigns, but at
this time, when the people want a strong,
progressive and conservative administra
tion, the Bear Club has come forward
and Indorsed the entire ticket. We have
had considerable discussion about this
being a campaign of men and not of
party. The Republican party has always
advocated good, strong and conservative
government and in national affairs the
people always turn to the Republican
party. Then why should it not ' turn to
the Republican .party in municipal af
fairs?
William E. Lutz, the popular candidate
for Public Administrator, was introduced
and was gl% - en a fine greeting. In the
course of his remarks he said:
"It seems like addressing a club meet
ing to look over this audience and it
would be manifestly useless to make any
remarks to the members of the Bear
Club; but to those who are not members,
to those who are Republicans and to those
few Democrats who have strayed in here,
I wish to say that I have the honor to
appear before you asking your suffrage
for the office of Public Administrator. I
ask your support not only for myself but
for the whole ticket, and I want to in
dorse the remarks of Bahrs! Bahrs!
Bahrs! (applause) and that is the whole
ticket will be elected. The candidate that
is in the field for Mayor is a winner. We
have canvassed the city thoroughly, and,
notwithstanding the reports In the papers
opposed to his election, he will win.
Kverywhere he goes his personality
makes itself felt. It Is our duty as can
didates to appear before you, and to show
ourselves in order that you may judge the
character of men we are. We a8k your
support for the ticket, nothing more and
nothing less. I thank you." (Great ap
plause.)
George Alpers. candidate for Supervisor,
delivered a forcible speech and was heart
ily applauded. In the course of his speech
he said:
as a soapmaker as a youth and earned
$100 a month. I gave that occupation up
to go into a law office at $3 a week and
studied law. I was elected to the Superior
bench and my/ record was such that no
one can cay aught against me. If I am
elected Assessor I shall serve: the people
with honor to them and honor to myself."
(Great cheering.)
Judge Bahrs left the hall at the con
clusion of his whirlwind speech and as he
passed out he was apjiJauded and the
voters present promised to stand by him.
LTJTZ MAKES FBEENDS.
Chairman Tolle waited for the applause
to pubside and then introduced . Judge
Qeorge H. Bahrs as the first speaker of
The evening. The reception tendered the
candidate for Assessor must have im

formed the assemblage that he was re

would be .elected to the office.
"Our enemies on the other side of ths

would sweep the town for their candidate
for Assessor, but they reckoned without
their host." he continued. "I believe Hie
Republican party has a man In the field
for the office of Assessor. (Cries: 'You
bet they have.') Two weeks ago I don't
think many of you would have tfven
much for my chances for election. Some
â¢thought I was foolish for spoiling ray
chances, but I thought differently. I al
ways had ah idea that when the Repub
lican party nominated a man for office
that the nomination of the party pledged
the party for the nominee. The Demo
cratic standard bearer, Mr. Lane, at the
opening of his campaign made the ex
traordinary admission that he believed
that the Republican party In San Fran
cisco was numerically the strongest in
the campaign. If that admission Is true,
and if the support of the party goes with
the nominee, then in God's name how can
I or any other candidate on the Rcpnb
lic&a ticket be defeated oa election day.

voters. The reception accorded Henry J.

most ardent admirers. He arrived at

by the shouts of enthusiasts who crowd

OVATION TO BAHBS.
BEAR CLUB'S MEETING.
THE boom for Henry J. Crocker, the
Republican candidate for Mayor, Is
in full force, and the effect is now
being felt by those who have
watched . his campaign. Volunteers are
coming forward to enroll themselves un
der his standard, and his majority on
election day promises to be a big one.
Wherever Mr. Crocker went last night he
was greeted with cheers. The acclaim of
the people of this city, who look upon
him as their r.ext Mayor, sounded In his
cars all evening. He attended four meet
ings and as many social gatherings, and
in every instance when the clean-cut fig
itre of the next Mayor was seen entering
the hall_ the audience rose and cheered
until the rafters rang.
Mr. Crocker's clean campaign has at
tracted the best people in the community
to his standard. He Jias g-one through the
entire campaign without saying an unkind
word against his opponents. He has sim
ply appealed to the citizens of this com
murJty to elect him to the ofilce of Mayor
and In return he promises to give them
a good, clean, honest and faithful admin
istration. His speeches to the citizens
that .assembled in Richmond district,
Austrian Hail, Pioneer Hall and B'nai
B'rfth Hall last night were full of prom
ises that were not of the idle kind. What
he .said "came from his heart, and he
â¢reused lots of enthusiasm by his man
**ar of speaking. He has disabused the
minds of the workingman of the belief
that he is an aristocrat. He does not lose
his dignity, but he does appeal to their
better Judgment, and they find in him a
citizen of standing in the community and
a man in whom they can trust their fu
ture welfare. He is a vote-getter, and
this will be shown to his opponents on
election day, when he will be elected
Mayor of San Francisco by a generous
majority.
Lane is hopelessly out of the running,
and the betting on the streets and in the
poolrooms has reached 10 to 1 that he will
be last. Crocker is the favorite, and the
etanch supporters of the Republican can
didate and the wise ones are putting up
large sums on his chances of victorv.

Standard Bearer
Cheered All
Over Town.
Speaks to Crowds
in Every Part
of City.
PROBABLY the best and the most
enthusiastic meeting that has ever
been held in Richmond Hall occur-
red last night, Henry J.
Crocker addressed the 'voters of the Thir
ty-ninth Assembly District. The hall was
packed from the bottom of the stairs to
the bannered front of the platform.
I. D. Bluxom called the meeting to or
der and nominated John D. Williams as
chairman. Mr. Crocker arrived at the
hall about 9 o'clock and was forced to
edge his way through the crowd congre
gated on the outside. His appearance in
side and outside of the hall created
scenes of unparalleled enthusiasm. After
his speech he was fairly carried off his
feet by the rush of men to congratulate
him. '.-, Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦-:..;Â¦:
He had the audience with him from the
first. His opening declaration that he
was a Republican was greeted with
cheers. Then he went on and told how
as a bov he had seen the district grow
from dull sand hills to its. present beauty
and expressed hia satisfaction at the
change. As a boy who has worked his
way and become a prosperous business
man, he said he gloried In the fact that
the city that had afforded him the oppor
tunities was broadening out like the ocean,
leaving in its course prosperous residence
districts and happy, contented people.
He reminded his listeners that abova
everybody else they were interested la
the dispensing of the $17,000,000 Of bonds
which were voted at the recent election.
There were sewers to be built, he said,
schoolhouses to be erected and streets to
be constructed in the district. All of
these improvements, he pledged, would be
carried out according to the provisions
of the bond issue when he became Mayor.
He said he was not fishtins anybody
personally in the campaign. He had neg
lected his business for the purpose of
offering himself to his fellow citizens as
the manager of the funds which they had
voted to expend in improvements. From
his boyhood, he said, he never had been
out of employment, because his watch
word had been "integrity." A strict ad
herence to that had made him a pros
perous business man. and he said he be
lieved he could exercise better judgment
in the disbursing of the immense funds
at the control cf the next Mayor than
either of the gentlemen opposing him.
At the close of his speech jar. Crocker
attempted to leave the hall quietly, but
he was besieged by the crowd, which in
sisted on shaking hands with him and
assuring him the most complete triumph
that has ever been attained in the Thirty
ninth Assembly District for any candi
date." ;-.":.Â¦
Robert Vance, candidate on the Repub
lican ticket for Supervisor, made many
friends. by a happy address. Among the
other speakers were A. Van der Naillen.
George C. Lynch, Mark Anthony and
George H. Bahra Jr.
J. Crocker, who was greeted with cheers
three times three as he entered. He was
one of the jolliest and most popular
guests at the dinner. For the hour of the
feast he mingled in a way with the men
that showed he is not only a good "mix
er," as so many workinfcmen have said
of him, but a good comrade as well.
Mr. . Crocker made a few remarks in
praise of the dinner and the efforts of
those who are working for him on the
front and he was cheered again to tha
echo. It was one constant succession of
men coming forward to grasp his hand af
ter that. Numbers of union men gave
him promises of support and words of
encouragement.
Dr.UG GLEBES MEET.
Henry J. Crocker Received as Guest
of Honor.
More than ISO members of the Drus
Clerks' Association greeted Henry J.
Crocker as the guest of honor at a smoker
given by the association last night at
Alcazar Hall. Between the numbers of
a programme of songs anct . Jokes Mr.
Crocker made a few remarks that were
well received.
Mr. Fretz, president of the Drug Clerks*
Association, introduced the next Mayor
as Mr. Crocker. Mr. Crocker, in response,
said:
"I am glad to be Introduced that way,
as that was the* spirit in which I cam
to this smoker. I am not going to talk
politics, as I know that those of you here
that are Republicans will attend to that,
and I have no wish to tread on the toes
of some of the otners."
He told some interesting experiences
from, his early life as a clerk in the
Sierras, that were loudly applauded. Mr.
Crocker was roundly cheered as he left
the hall to attend a reception given by
the Eagles.

curing them. The facts In the matter are
as follows:
"This is a great district for handing
out gold bricks, and Ruef thinks you are
gullible. He is mistaken this time. You
know what you want and you are going
to have It. The candidate on the head
of the Union Labor party sails under a
false label. He does not represent that
party; he represents Abe Ruef's party.
"In all the appointments during the last
two years there were only 200 to the
Union Labor party men. You will find,
my friends, that the true labor union
men will come back to the Democratic
fold, and on Tuesday night we will have
an overwhelming majority."
Dr. Glannlnl presided at the meeting.
Short speeches wore made by Edward
Rock, John Connor, W. W. Sanderson,
Judge Cabaniss, Judge Mogan, Thomas
HIckey and Frank Grace.
Ho started his speech by saying: "If
there is to be a boss in any party, at
least let him belong to that party and
afliliate with it and be a part of it. Don't
let him belong to the Republican ranks
and try to run the Union Labor party. I
am against all bosses. I am for the plain,
absolute and simple rights of all the peo
ple at large, whether they belong to the
laboring classes or whether they repre
sent the Interests of capital. In the office
of the Mayor all shall have an equal hear
ing, the poor and the rich alike. The of
fice of the chief executive of this munici
pality shall always be open for the ad
ministration for the people's good, and
there will be no playing to favorites' if I
am elected. I want a clean, straight gov
ernment, and if you want that kind of ad
ministration, all right; if you don't, why
you must vote for the other kind â and
that is the Abe Ruef kind. You have got
to rely on the Integrity of the men in of
fice, and that being the case, go to the
polls on Tuesday next and, vote for the
men who will give you your Just rights,
irrespective of any partisanship. Lift
yourselves above party lines and show
this great commonwealth that we are
honest, true, free-thinking, loyal Ameri
can citizens, who have the Interests of
our city's welfare at heart. The votes you
are casting now are not to simply cover
the issue of the passing momentâ they
are votes that are to tell for the future
and for all time. They are votes to stamp
out bossism and show the world at large
that the citizens of San Francisco know
what Is right, and that they want honesty
to be the watchword henceforth in the
management of the affairs of our grand
municipality."
Thomas McKeon was master of ceremo
nies. Talks were made by Dr. Dodge,
John Connor, Judge Mogan, P. J. Curtis,
A. H. Wehe. T. Carey Friedlander, John
Barnett and Oscar Hocks.
Lane's third speech was to the voters of
the Korty-fifth Assembly District in
Washington-square Hall, on Stockton and
Union streets. In the early evening the
hall had been crowded, but as the hour
grew late "many left, and when Lane ar
rived at 11 o'clock the hall was only com
fortably filled. Those who were there,
however, were evidently all for Lane,
judging from the bursts of applause that
punctuated all the salient points of his re
markr. He said in part:
"I am sorry I came so late, but it could
not be helped. The distances between the
halls are great and much time was lost
on that account. .1 can see at a glance
that you ail are with me in this fight, and
I thank you for this kind and unusually
hearty demonstration, which is most wel
come to me. I had always thought that
this district was run by Abe Ruef, at
least that is what I know he gives out,
but this outpouring of support to the
cause of clean administration proves that
he is wrong in his assertions. He has
promised you a great many things here
in this locality and he will get them for
you or not as suits his fancy and inclina
tion.
Lane made his second speech to the
voters- of the Thirtieth Assembly District
at Teutonia Hall on Howard street, be
tween Ninth and Tenth.
Others who spoke were Judge Cabaniss,
Dr. Dodge, Lewis T. Bylngton, Dr. Le
land, â¢'Billy" Hynes, Judge Mogan and
John Marble.
"You want a clean, honest government,
and you don't want a government that is
run by a boss. My record is clean and I
think you all know it. If you are with
me and the party I represent for a just
administration of the affairs of this
municipality go to the polls and vote for
me, but if you are for the Abe Ruef kind
of government and want that kind, don't
vote for me, because you won't get that

peared upon the platform: In two min
utes he had stilled them and in five min
utes he had them cheering for himself.
The Republican campaign committee has
gone over the estimates from each district
and is absolutely confident that Mr.
Crocker will secure more than 25,000 votes
next Tuesdii;-.
Registrar Wa!sh states that the total
number of electors on the Great Register
and entitled to vote next Tuesday 13
7D.7S4. This includes the names of about
two thousand voters who have been
marked as "moved" from the residences
they gave when registering. Unless they
can satisfactorily explain that they live
at the designated places they wCl not be
allowed to vote.
MANY HAVE DIED.
Of course the register also contains the
names of many electors r.ho have died
since their last registration, but the ex
act number ia not known. Walsh thinks
that the total vote at the election will be
within 60,000. The Republican campaign
committee estimates that the total vote
will be somewhere between S?/>00 and 60,
000. The result for Mayor is? thus fore
casted:
Crocker. 25.000: Schmitz. 19,000; Lane.
14.00U; Whitney (Socialist). 2000; total 60,
000.
There is political gossip to the effect
that the Socialistic vote will show a
marked increase. It is said that many
I Union Labor men who cannot stand Ruef
will vote the Socialist ticket rather than
give their support to a Republican or
Democrat. The betting In places where
wagers are laid on a regular business
basis, apart from political or personal
sentiment/ Is 4 to 1 agalntst Lane. The
professional betting man offers to wager
$100 against C5 that Lane will not be bet
ter than third in the race. Colonel Ko
walsky yesterday wagered $1000 that
Crocker would be elected Mayfcr. The
wager was accepted by a Schmitz man.
Two years ago Kowalsky Det on Schmitz
.and won $1700.
So great Is the tide of popularity that
has 3et in toward Henry j. Crocker that
he is in demand at some place every hour
in the day. His office is i>e3ieged with
people from the various districts, each
anxious to make some appointment In
their section for the next Mayer. They
all believe that on next Tuesday a Re
publican tidal wave for Crocker will
! swamp the other candidates for Mayor.
This . feelinz. Is' In .the atmosphere and
accordingly new friends are.' coming for
ward, the people who always take card
to be on the right .slda of the fence. The
many -hostile attacks against him- have
only served, it would seem, to bring new
supporters to him. Yesterday found him
along the docks carrying on hU fight In
the manly, straightforward way that has
marked his campaign, and which even hl3
enemies have paused to admire. Eich
day now means new routes and new ef
forts to a victorious finish, next Tuesday.
ARMY MOURNS
DEAD LEADER
HENRY J. CROCKER, Republican
nominee, is surely the leading
candidate in the race for Mayor.
His position in the front exposes
him to attack, but the assaults are inef
fective. He goes forward winning new
friends for himself and gaining new advo
cates of a greater San Francisco. The
Crocker column Js securing many acces
sions from the wage earning ranks.
The time has come for the conservative
citizen, -who believes that the election of
Schmitz would be a calamity, to pause
and soberly consider the chances of the
two other candidates for Mayor. It will
not be forgotten that two years ago
Wells, the Republican candidate, ran
nearly 5000 votes ahead of Tobln, the
Democrat, and this in spite of the fact
that a large number of Republicans vot
ed for Tobin. The reason of this was that
the Union Labor party is nearly 80 per
cent Democratic and the Democratic
party is GO per cent Union Labor. Tobin
lost nearly 60 per cent of the vote which
he would have received If there had been
no Union Labor candidate. The Demo
cratic portion of this vote la as solidly
for Schmitz this year as It was two years
ago. Mr. Lane has absolutely failed to
produce any effect upon this vote and in
consequence he goes into the campaign
with a defection of nearly 60 per cent.
It Is absolutely impossible for him to
draw, enough' votes outside of his party
to make up this loss. Mr. Crocker, on the
other hand, has made â¢ many accessions
from the labor ranks, chiefly from union
men who are Republicans and who be
lieve that Schmitz is not representative
of unionism and that unionism Is best
served by a man who will preserve and
advance the business interests of the
city.
SIGNIFICANT FACT.
Another significant fact is that last
year, with three tickets for judicial of
fices in the field, the Democratic Judges
and Justices of the Peace received from
10,000 to 15,000 votes. The reason for this
is that the same condition prevailed last
year as the year before â 60 per cent of
the Democratic vote went to Union La
bor nominees. Two years ago many Re
publicans voted for Tobln because Wells
had made blunder after blunder, and his
weakness was apparent to all. Tobln was
taken up as a forlorn hope and the Re
publicans who voted for Tobln . elected
Schmitz. This year, on the other hand.
Mr. Crocker gained the confidence; . of
every one right at the start. He has made
a straightforward, manly fight and has
proved himself worthy of the support of
all. . ' Wells lost votes every time he ap
peared upon the platform and Crocker
has gained them. A conspicuous Instance
of this was at the Potrero Opera-house
Monday night The crowd, -which was
largely Union Labor, had been shouting
for Schmitz all the evening. Crocker ap r

be worried about their positions. They
deny emphatically that' the girl was killed
in her home on Sunday night, and say
that she was not at home that night.
They declare that they were not aware
that they were suspected of a guilty
knowledge of hen murder. Speaking of
his brother Tom's suicide John said:
"I guess he was troubled too much. He
worried because he could not go to the
funeral." â¢
â¢ .There was a rumor to-day that Mrs.
Bechtel, mother of the murdered girl, had
attempted suicide last night. At the time
it developed, however, that she was at
police headquarters.
Alfred Eckstein, Miss Bechtel's affianced
lover, who was held as a witness, was ad

had enough of Peter J. Curtis when the

on the "two cow" ordinance.
Dairymen assert that the provisions of
the ordinance were applied rigidly ; to
those who did not buy hay of Curtis. The
story is told of one dairyman who com
plained of the hard features of the ordi

The Mayor at last got started and dwelt

the strikes he had successfully settled; to
the good he would accomplish if re

. by'the knocking of the stones together as
tfcpy are rolled along upon the bottom of

. The erosive power of a stream flowing
over a rocky bed is determined by its abil
ity to chove along sand and pebbles and
gravfl over its bottom. It Is thesp par
ticles of eolid matter that accoinpliah the
erosion, acting as a rasp, or sandpaper,
or more properly a sand blast, to remove
'tb*Â» .solid rock beneath and deepen the
channel of a stream. In ordÂ«r to do this,
however, there ha* W be proper adjust
jnent between the supply. of loose solid
matter to be transported and the volume
and velocity of the water. If there is
'more sand and gravel than the current
can handle, this will accumulate upon the
bottom and fill up rather than deepen the
bed. If there is too little material the
stream will flow over the rocks without
effecting much erosion, while If there is
JuiVthe right amount of solid material to
be shoved along it will deepen the chan
nel with great rapidity.
There are many striking examples of
â¢tbe work which has been accomplished by
rivers in deepening and widening their
channels. We look upon the rise of moun
tain chains as being most majestic
illustrations of the power of natural
forces, but the fact is equally impreÂ»slve
that in many cases rivers which run
across the line of mountain elevation are
eble to wear down their channels as fast
â¢* the mountains rise, and thus maintain
their ancient onward course. The Hudson
Hiver has thus sawed down a channel
through the -solid rocks which in ancient
Rf ologic times arwc across its course at
West Point and below, all that plctur
*>*que valley of the Hudson being a valley
of erosion. The Delaware River has worn
an even more striking gorge through the
Blue Ridge at the Delaware Water Gap,
%here it cuts directly across the very
hard strata of Medina sandstone consti
tuting the Blue Ridge, forming perpendic
ular walls on cither 6lde 1000 feet in
â¢height. Similar gorges are found In the
Susquehanna and Potomac and many
other rivers along the Appalachian chain
Just above where they emerge upon the
Burrounding lowland. We often speak of
Buch rivers as "bursting" through their
barrier. But there was no bursting in
the operation. These gorges were cut by
the slow process which we have described,
the rivers lowering their channels gradu
ally as the mountains slowing rose across
them.
. Among the most striking examples of
rivers which have by erosion kept pace
â¢with the elevation of mountains across
their course is that of the Columbia Riv
Â«Â»r, in Oregon, which crosses the Cascade
â¢ Mountains, where for a long distance it
occupies a trough running â¢ directly
through the mountain chain thousands of
feet in depth. Another very striking in
etariCe Is that to. be seen In the Amur
Klver where it crosses the Bureya Moun
tains. In -Eastern Siberia. -For nearly 100
miles the stream crosses this range with
a gradient that is continuous with that of
Gecrrre Frederick VTrigfet.
NEGRO PEONAGE.
THERE is no doubt tntt the people, of the North look
with a degree of complacency upon suppression of
the negro vote in the South. The constitutions of
the Southern States which have been so amended as to
strike down the franchise that is conferred upon negroes
by the fifteenth amendment all make a remote provision
for the electoral rights of negroes in the future, based upon
an educational qualification. .The merit of this vague protn
Â«se, however, consists in giving free and ample educational
advantages to the young of that race. It is plain that, with
the ballot to protect him, the negro can secure for himself
the opportunity of education. But without the ballot he
must look to the white voters for educational privileges.
What he may expect in the matter is shown by recent
events in Mississippi. In that State ji Governor has been
chosen upon the issue that the white people will permit
oniy the taxes paid by negroes to be devoted to schools
for that race, and that the expenditure of such taxes for
that purpose shall be wholly in the hands of. the whites.
This limitation and segregation of the school fund is de
structive of the purpose of the free, common school sys
tem. No one will reasonably expect that even the taxes paid
by the negroes will be so used by the whites as to produce
what they should of proper school facilities. If the power
exist to so limit the endowment of public schools for
negroes, it also exists to permit a limitation of the use of
the poor facilities that will be provided. It will be seen
that under such circumstances the promise that the ballot
shall be the prise of intelligence and education is of but
little value. It may, as a legal proposition, validate the
constitutions of which it is a part, but practically it will be
useless.
Already other aggressions arc appearing, in the train
of those constitutions which nullify the fifteenth amend
ment. It is in human, nature to get something for nothing,
and in no direction is this disposition more plainly mani
fested than in the desire of man to own his fellow man, or
to get the benefit of his labor without compensation. In
South Carolina and Alabama, it is revealed by judicial pro
ceedings that negroes in large numbers' have been reduced
to involuntary servitude. The process is cloaked under
various pretenses, usually being considered as the satisfac
tion of an execution for debt. But, under whatever excuse
it flourishes, it is practically the reduction of the negroes
to a condition of slavery. It is now-announced that this
system is generally prevalent in Louisiana, 'and in the
parish of Ouachita it has been under investigation by the
Federal authorities, and the courts of the United States
are appealed to for its suppression. .; .,.
The people of the , North are apparently willing, to see
the fifteenth' amendment fall into disuse, though even the
Democratic State convention of Massachusetts protests
against its repeal. But* between the disuse of that amend
ment and consequent suppression of the negro vote, : and
the denial of schooling and his re-enslaverhent, there is a
wide gulf. The Northern sentiment, which listens
approvingly to Senator Tillman's diatribes against the
political equality and domination of the negro, and believes
that white minorities should , not be governed by ; black
majorities, will not be found-indifferent to this recrudes
cence of slavery. The thirteenth and fourteenth i amend
ments were made necessary by the result, of the Civil War.
To have won in that struggle and then to have written no
new authority into the Federal' constitution would have
made Â« the war an inconsequential folly, a useless sacrifice,
a mighty effort without "excuse '. for its beginning and with
out glory at its ..close. Soothe thirteenth amendment "was
incorporated, providing that:- "Neither slavery nor invol
untary servitude,. except as a punishment for crime whereof
the party shall have been duly, convicted, shair exist within
the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."
Southern peonage, proved to be prevalent in niany~ States,"
clearly nullifies that amendment. When 'involuntary- ser T
vitude for debt is enforced, either by State law 1 ; or 'local
custom, or by taking advantage of the weakness or ignor
ance of its victim, the thirteenth amendment is violated.
" The' fourteenth amendment was likewise made necessary
by the Civil. War and its result. It makes all persons born
or naturalized in this country citizens of the United States
and of the State wherein they reside, and forbids the abridg
ment of their rights as human beings, and deprivation of
life, liberty or property, without due process of law.
Many Republican leaders and wise men devoted to the
maintenance of the Union and of the rights of- man have
admitted that the fifteenth amentknent differs from the
other two. The thirteenth amendment was declared in
force December , 18, .1865, before the disbanding of the
Union armies had been completed. The fourteenth was
put in force July 28, 1868, three years after the close of the
war, but after its necessity, as supplemental to the thirteenth
amendment, had become clear. But the fifteenth amend
ment, the enfranchising clause, did not become a part of
the constitution until March 30, 1870. As we have said,
many wise men admit that in its adoption was the clement
of a partisan necessity. While history leaves no doubt that
before the war was half over its secondary purpose was
revealed to be the destruction of slavery, at no time was
negro enfranchisement one of its objects. That came later,
in response to a supposed political necessity. But, notwith
standing that, there was in the fifteenth amendment a
higher purpose than partisan interest. There were those who
advocated it as necessary to the negro for the preservation
of his freedom. 'Let the South beware of proving that
they were right. Let the South beware of proving to the
Norih that nullification of the fifteenth amendment is not
for the purpose of saving white people from negro rule,
but is for the purpose of returning negroes to slavery.
No More Waste of Pozvder.
According to English naval reports Ad
miral Sir John Fisher, the new naval com
mander in chief and Governor of Ports
mouth, who is regarded in naval circles
In Europe as among the most eminent of
the English naval commanders of the
present day, has introduced a reform at
Portsmouth which might be copied with
advantage both in this country and
abroad. He has issued an order abolish
ing three-fourths of the salutes custom
ary in the- service. Every warship arriv
ing at Splthead until now, even if only
for a stay of a few hours, has been com
pelled to salute the flag of the commander
in chief with a number, of guns, the sa
lute being acknowledged In the same man.
ncr. In future visiting ships are not to
fire salutes. The captains are, aa hereto
fore, required to pay their respects to the
admiral, but Sir John Fisher does not
want any mofe of what the renowned Mr,
Mantalinl would describe as "dem'd non
senso" In the form of t salutes of iomÂ»
twenty-four guns. Of course, this order
only applies to English ships. But it would
be a great advantage if other nations
were to adopt the reform as well. as. a
large amount of money is wasted each
year in these salutes.
JVor.ders of Human Body.
BT W. R. C. LATSON. ML D.
(Editor Health Culture Mapazine. XÂ«*w York.)
The human body is the result of na
ture's best efforts through millions of
years to build a perfect mechanism. A
slmp'e and beautiful illustration of this Is
found in the arrangement of the fibers
which support the rounded ends of the
leng bonos. In the femur, the long bone
of the upper leg. the strain upon the up
per end comes in every direction, because
not only must this portion of the kg sup
port the entire weight of the body, but
the joint, being a ball and socket or "uni
versal" joint, the head of the bone must
resist pressure In evfry direction.
Man must have been well on toward
civilization before he began to u.=e pipes
anil tubes vo conduct water from the
spring to his garden, kitclun or horse
trough. And yet, in his own wonderful
body, there art at least iXÂ»W mlUs of tub
iKfrLpipf n to carry blood, to carry Jymph,
to carry all the many fluids of thft body
from one point to another. The human
body, in fact, is more than four-fifths wa
ter, and this water, in the form
of various fluids. blood, lymph,
chyme. chyle, perspiration and so
on. is in constant fluctuation. Every
:!ushins, paling, shiver-i-every laugh.
yawn or movementâ means a change In
the wondenul tides of the body. The
iSdt-s of the bodyâ a volume might be
VTittta about them! And these tides, for
the most part, occur through the medium
of the tubes of the bedy.
The tubes range in size from the alimen
tary tube, which has a dlamettr of from
one to several ir.chts- and a length of
about thirty feet, to the smallest blood
tabes i known as capillaries, from their
supposed resemblance to a hair, although
they are much smaller than any hair),
seme cl which ar^ less tiian one twenty
five thousandth cf an inch in diameter.
ThÂ«tsr- fine hairlike tubes (.capillaries)
I*ne;rate the Ufeucs everyivh. re in a deli
taite network. This capillary network is
the theater of several very important and
interesting operations, of which we will
speak moi--- fully in future articles.
Then we have the filters of the body,
which axe among the most striking of ail
the body's marvels. First of all their
number is beyond all computation. All
the various fluids of the botlyâ saliva,
feastrio juice, bile. Intestinal fluid, pan
creatic juice, tears, perspiration, sinovial
fluid and many othersâ are all elaborated
out of the bloud by means of cells, each
one of which is a minute lUter. . And the
most wonderful thing about these tiller*;
Is, after all. not their number or their
minute size, but" the fuel that they are
living niters, wide awake and intelligent.
Each knows what it wants and takes up
from the blood just that and nothing else.
V'usuully these tiny filter cells combine,
placing themselves side by side and form
ing what 5s called a gland. These glands
are always surrounded by a thick net
work of line b'ood tubes (capillaries > just
described, out of which tha collection of
filler cells, called a gland, selects thÂ« ele
ments it nee-ds to produce the particular
fluid required. These glands are infinite
ly numerous and vary in size from those
too small to be seen with the naked eye
up to the liver, the largest gland In the
body, which is about a foot long and
Â¦weighs four pounds. The glands are very
Interesting and important and will be giv
en a chayter to themselves later.
Other Interesting mechanical devices of
the body sire the bellows and the camera.
The former is found in the lungs, or
rather in the action of the trunk, which
permits the operation of the lungs. The
chest, like the bellows, tends always to
return to the collapsed condition. The
muscles, however, which are attached to
the ribs and to other fixed parts above
them, have an action which forces them
upward and farther apart, and thereby
Increases the capacity of the chest cav
ity. This increase of the size of the
chest causes the air to rush in, and thus
the lungs are filled.
The eyeball corresponds most perfectly
to the darkroom of a camera, and the
eye to the sensitive plate. The resem
blance is complete, even to the Inversion
of the image. It Is not generally known
perhaps that the image thrown on the
retina of the eye, like the image which
the photographer sees when he ducks un
der the black cloth, is upside down. Yet
In reality everybody sees everything up
side down. This matter will be more
fully discussed in an article on vision.
Meantime we may mention that many of
the most ingenious attachments invented
for the camera are merely clumsy varia
tions of nature's beautiful devices install
ed many millions of years ago in the vis
ual apparatus of the animal.
Of the body as a commonwealth, of its
marvelous water way. Its Irrigation sys
tem, its fluctuating tides, its musical in
struments, Its rhythms and its warfares
all these will furnish texts for future ar
ticles. Thus far we have merely taken
a quick glance at a few of the countless
wonders of the human body.
Italian King's Simplicity.
"One great source of the popular sym
pathy enjoyed by King Victor Emmanuel
is his complete absence of vanity. In
which he again presents a striking con
trast to his friend, the Emperor William."
says a Paris correspondent of the London
Times.
"On a certain festive occasion. In reply
to a pompous and florid discourse by ona
of his Ministers, the King, instead of a
regular speech in the same style, content
ed himself with a warm shake of the
hand and a Thank you.' to the scandal
and dismay of the court. In concert with
the Queen, he suppressed "le ridicule
quadrille d'honneur" at the court balls,
and thus relieved a number of gouty and
decrepit celebrities of the necessity of
taking a turn on the floor with Princesses
and ladles of honor. Victor Emmanuel
considered that to be an absurd and hu
miliating spectacle and abolished It. His
taste for the automobile affords him op
portunities of avoiding tedious and ex
pensive official receptions. He is opposed
to all state parade, and has quite ex
cluded It from his private life. He loves
solitude and tranquillity and speaks of
his island retreat of Monte Cristo â a aoi
itude suspended between sea and skyâ as
his moral sanitarium.'*

WITHIN the last few days the political atmosphere of San Francisco, which for weeks lias
been clouded by false issues, absurd pretensions and the babel of conflicting pleas and as
pirations, has cleared. It is well for the voter that now his own good judgment, his own
common sense, his analysis of the events which have been agitating the city, point out to
him inevitably the correct course to' pursue at the polls. The cries of partisans, the buncombe of pro
fessional heelers, the pitiable, slanders of the chickadee newspapers fortunately count for 1 nothing with
the mechanic who wishes well for his city and with the merchant whose prosperity is absolutely de
pendent upon good government, safe administration and the proper, economical expenditure of public
monevs. .
In the triangular fight for Mayor One fact cannot be gainsaid. It stares at the intelligent voter in
every sign of the campaign. It speaks in the records of public meetings and in the opinions of men
who' place the welfare of" their city above petty partisanship. It is told in the movement and fluctuation
of parties and in the changes in party affiliations. It is plain beyond dispute to every one having interest
enough to observe. This fact is pre-eminently that Franklin K. Lane is hopelessly third in the Mayor
alty contest and cannot by any stretch of sympathy or imagination be considered a factor in the race.
Every vote cast for him is a vote wasted. Every vote for hinvis negatively a vote against good gov
ernment. Every ballot given in compliment to him is a trifling with serious issues ancUa jeopardy to
the proper administration of San Francisco and its affairs.
Every voter who has at heart the best interests of his city, who wishes to see it prosperous and
proo-ressivc.who wishes to see workingmen employed and well paid and merchants successful in their
undertakings, who desires a moral, healthful, businesslike conduct of public affairs, must silence senti
ment and accept conditions. He must recognize that in this campaign the Mayor counts for much as the
representative of policies and principles and as their active administrator in office.
The voter, then, in duty bound must cast his ballot for him who has naturally the best chance
to win and who represents in himself and in his personal and party following the better elements of
political and civic life. It is plain, therefore, to every one that Franklin K. Lane cannot win, and that
Henry I. Crocker can. A vote for Lane is a wasted endeavor, whatever its motive, and a vote for
Crocker is a distinct, material contribution to the cause of a growing, healthful, progressive city. This
It is plain that the natural partisan support of Lane is divided beyond hope of union,, while that
of Crocker is enthusiastic, rational, systematic and thoroughly organized in united front. While a vote
tor Lane does not figure positively in the Mayoralty contest, one foi* Crocker contributes to a result,
and that result should be the intimate concern of every well-meaning citizen of San Francisco. Those
that have followed the progress of the campaign have noticed, if they have noticed anything, that
where Lane was received a year ago with acclamations and every demonstration of sympathy and sup
port he is now greeted with jeers, insults and repudiation that ' has bordered on personal violence.
Wherever he has gone to this, his natural following, he has done so at the hazard of new indignities.
On the other hand, Crocker has entered even this stronghold, that was a year ago Lane's and is
now divided; and has met with such marked encouragement as to hold forth every indication of material
support from it. ! Again, to enforce doubly this condition, Crocker stands at the head of a united party
which has been cleansed of its parasites. His long career as a man of business and a merchant has won
him the emphatic, non-partisan indorsement of men whose only partisanship in municipal politics is an
insistent demand for a clean, honest, economical and businesslike administration. Can there be, then,
any question to the voter of what to do? On the one hand a vote is wasted and great interests are
jeopardized. On the other the cause of healthy city government is indorsed and supported and aid is
given to the restoration of the city's good name. It is before the voters to choose.

ThÂ© Yenisei River has cut a similar gorge
across the granite mountain chain which
rose up to separate the fertile plains of
Minusinsk from the vaster plains of
Northern Siberia.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Coming to our own country, we have in
addition to the streams already men
tioned gorges and canyons on a most im
pressive scale In the upper part of the
Susrjuehanna River, where the east
branch cuts across the Allegheny Moun
tains south of the State of New York and
forms the beautiful Wyoming Valley,
which is wholly one of erosion. The west
branch has likewise cut a gorge of equal
dimensions fifty miles or more in length
west of Williamsport, which is fully 1000
feet In depth, as one can see by the fact
that here the coal mines on either side
are. that distance above the bed of the
stream and of the railroad track. Coming
to the other side of the Allegheny Moun
tains one strikes into the various branches
of the Ohio River and finds himself in a
trench several hundred feet below the
general level of the land and extending
for more than 1000 miles in length until
the river emerges Into the center of the
Mississippi Valley. The upper part of the
Mississippi occupies a similar gorge for a
etlll greater distance. Everywhere along
this portion of their course on ascending
either side of the rivers to the summit one
will find himself upon a vast plain, ex
tending off in either direction, whose main
superficial irregularities are those which
bave been produced by the erosion of the
countless smaller streams which joined
together make the great rivers.
"Quartz" Billings Talks.
Down in one of the hotels on lower
Kearny 6treet, where every old miner
who comes to town to spend his "wad"
sits around the checker table and min
gles yarns with his chewing tobacco, old
"Quartz" Billings of Tonopah wa9 de
claiming against the peculiarities of Ne
vada justice the other night.
"There was that row of the Ragtown
milkmen to prove that there ain't enough
justice In that State to put in your eye,"
quoth Quartz, accurately flooding a fly at
ten feet range. "Now, there was Smoky
Watson, who kinder 'spicioned Yaller
Dickâ I disremember his last name â of
milkin' the cows belongin' to' him and
sellin' the milk after sklmmln' oft the
cream, to feed his bullpups with. Smoky
didn't mind the stealln 1 of the milk so
much as he did the feedln* of the cream
to Yaller Dick's bull pups: but arfyway he
hadTTaller Dick arrested. ..i-.vv*
"Well, they got a jury together before
Old Tribunal in Washoe City. The evi
dence that cum in in that case was
enough to string forty horse thieves, but
the most of it showed that Yaller Dick's
wife did most of the milkln' of Smoky's
cows, so the jury came in and found Tal
ler Dick guilty of milkin* a cow in the
second degree. -
"The Jedge he couldn't find a punish
ment to fit the milkln' of a cow in the
second. degree, and he wore out the town
dlcshunary lookin* for one, so Yaller Dick
went free and jestlce was beaten agin.
"And then there was the case of the fel
ler that killed and et up Bueno to Hell's
calf. Bueno to Hell was purty fond of
that calf, and when he found its hide
hangin' in a- big greaser's cabin he bought
up the Sheriff's office and had the greaser
landed in the callboose. Well, that greas
er certalntly put up a good case of self
defense.
"He said he was workin' in a tunnel,
and he was drivln* in the side of a hill
when he looked up Into . the face of that
calf. The tunnel was so narrow the calf
couldn't turn round, and it had the string
halt and couldn't back up. The greaser
said he tried to get over and around the
calf, but he couldn't make it, and the
Critter wouldn't He down. So he took a
pick and dug his way through the calf to
liberty.
"The Jedge didn't believe th? story, and
told the greaser to go and bring the tun
nel..Into court as an exhibit. Â¦ Well, the
greaser lit out, and some say he pulled
the tunnel in after him: but anyway he
ain't been seen since, no more'n has the
man "that rot took in at that busted mtn

as he stood over the figure of a man
that was stretched out on the pavement-
Stooping, he grasped the ankles of the
sleeptr and carelessly swung the oift

An hour lattr he passed the spot again.
The sletper was still there. The officer
looked at his watch and noted that it was

before the sergeant shows up," he mut
tered; '"I'll give him a half hour more to

Thirty minutes later' the good-natured
officer again stood over the figure in the
doorway. "Here, old man/' he said, not
unkindly, "time's up. Hike out of this."
Not a move came in response to the of
ficer's words. Startled, he took a match
from his pocket and struck it on the wall.
One glance at the face In the doorway he
took and then straightened up. "He has
had his sleep out. all right." he softly eaid
aa he walked over to the call box. "Send

A petition was argued yesterday before
the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals asking that Charles Sweeney. F.
Lewis Clark and the Empire State-Idaho
Mining and Development Company be or
dered to app-ar before the court and
show cause, if any they have, why they
should not be punished for contempt for
having disobeyed an injunction.
The cetition recites that on November
I". 1302. the United States Circuit Court
fcr the district of Idaho entered a decree
in the case adjudging Kennedy J. Han
lev to be the owner of and quieted his
title to an undivided one-eighth interest
in the Skocham mine and mining claims,
and IssuÂ«d an order restraining the cp
pel'ees from working in or taking out any
ere from the Skookca mines. The peti
tion alleges further that on March 1. 1S03.
the appe!lÂ»?s resumed work in the Skoo
kun mine in defiance of the Injunction,
and that evÂ»r since that date they have
continued to extract ore, the total value
cf which is S1.2PO.9O0. taken out since that
date, and that they have failed to ac
count to the petitioner for his cne-eigfeth
Interest. It Is represented a!so that If
the appellees be not restrained they will
have exhausted the ore supply before
January 1, 1204.
It is alleged that on September 1. 1S"Â«,
Sweeney and h!s associates organized un
der the laws of Delaware the Federal
Mining and Smelting Company for the
purpose of purchasing and operating cer
tain no!n*s in Shoshone County, Idaho,
ameng others the property in controversy.
Sweeney became president and E. J. Rob
erts and W Clayton Miller respectively
general manager and assistant general
manager, and they continued to sell the
Skookum ore' in conjunction with other
ores from their mines, thus confusing the
Skookum ores with the rest.

his attemots and frustrated them. He
was not to be balked, however, she says,
and went acres- the line to Kansas, where
he secured a default decrre. From that
time on until a few months ago she knew
nothing of him. and then she learned he
was in Sacramento, with a woman known
as Mrs. Warner. and a young child.
Joseph Goldman, though married only
slnce September 3 last to Gussie Goldman,

years and still loved him. Goldman says
Greenspan &ni his wife planned to entrap

.The petition of Marie Knauer for the

taie of her late husband. Ferdinand
Knauer. was partly heard by Judge
Troutt yesterday.- It was then put over
for two weeks to enable her attorneys to
produce evidence in support cf their
claim that Marie Knauer was legally mar
ried to the aged German.
Mrs. Knatxer claims that she is entitled
to the $10,000 she petitions for as Knauer' 3
wife, as under his will she Is __ solo legatee.
She claims that even if the Will is refused
piobate she still will be entitled to the
widow's share of the estate, a sum con
siderably more than 110,009. She testified
yesterday that her marriage to Knauer
was legal and her certificate of marriage
was offered in evidence. She admitted
that she had been married twic* before
and said that her first husband died in
Germany. Her second husband, a Ger
man army officer, it is said she eloped
with from Germany and married In Chi
cago. He is residing in this city. She
started to say yesterday that she was di
vorced from him. but attorneys objected
on' the ground that the decree | of divorce
was the best evidence. The objection wa3
sustained by Judge Troutt and the case
continued to enable the attorneys to pro
vide the documentary proof.
The taking of testimony in the matter
of the deportation of James W. Erwin to
Washington. D. C; on. an indictment
found by the Federal Grand Jury of that
city was completed late yesterday after
noon before United States Court Commis
sioner Heacock. Several witnesses were
examined to rebut the evidence at A. JL
Cox that the time Indicator device was of
little or no utility in the residence part
of the city. These witnesses were W. E.
Palmer. E. G. Eisen and J. A. Truman,
who cheerfully testified that the Indicat
ors in the neighborhood of their resi
dences saved them many an unnecessary
trip to the postofflce and largely contrib
uted to their peace of mind.
j C. T. Ladercrantz, a postal employe,
i testified that there were S23 boxes in this
: city containing the time Indicator, and
that 842 boxes are visited by night col
Â¦ lectors. In the business district, he said,
1 there were 119 boxes.
James W. Erwin was handed a letter
purporting to have been written by him
to August W. Machen In February. 1302.
and Mr. Erwin said that the letter bad
not bÂ«?en written by him, although it bore
bis signature. With reference to the
statement made by him to Postoffice In
spector C L. Wayland, he asserted that
that statement of his connection with the
time device and Richardson was freely
and voluntarily given. He had answered
all the Questions that had been asked of
him by Wayland and he had not attempt
ed to conceal anything.
The witness contradicted the testimony
given by A. M. Cox on the day before.
"Cox never intimated to me," etid Mr.
Erwin. "that in the residence district the
device was a failure. I said that I would
like to call him as a witness for the pur
pose of testifying to the utility of the
time indicator and he replied that he
would have no objection to being 1 called-"
In reply to further questions by Sam
uel Knight, his counsel. Mr. Erwin said
that he had recently received five letters
from Washington, all of which had been
opened before they had been delivered to
him. One cf the letters had been opened
before the back stamp of the San Francis
co postoSce had been placed upon it. Mr.
Knight had informed him,- he " added, *aat
some of his friends had written from
Washington to the effect that they would
like to write to Mr. Erwin. but that they
feared that their letters would be opened
in the Washington postoQce. Some of
the letters from Washington. D. C._ that
had been opened were from Beavers and
Machen.
In answer to United States District At
torney Woodworth, the witness said that
the first Intimation that he had that any
stock had been distributed to officials
was in July, 1S03. when he learned that
Daniel S. Richardson, the president of
the company, had issued l'Xfl shares in
the name of McDonald at the suggestion
of Beavers and U,Â«jO shares in the name of
Seeger at the suggestion of Machen. His
suspicions were first aroused about two
years ago by a remark dropped by Pres
ident Richardson to the eSect that Ma
chen and # Beavers had delayed replying
to his letters because they might have
expected more stock. The witness admit
ted having received SX) shares In all for
his services in perfecting the device. He
had never asked for any stock, but it
was given to him voluntarily. He did not
know that it was necessary to advertise
for bide for patented articles.
After arguments by United States At
torney Woodworth and Mr. Knight the
matter was taken under advisement.

The second of the Scotch bowling tour
naments played on the Golden Gate Park
preen is nearingr a close. It will be fin
ished two weeks" from to-day. Three men
have already Qualified for the semi-final
round, and the remaining match will be
played this afternoon. The winner will
get the vacant place and will meet James
Gray. The match to be played to-day is
that between Joseph Gray, and J. Mc-
Lachlan. Gray has won all his matches
so easily that it is hardly expected Mc-
Lachlan will beat him. If the latter bowls
as he did against Barr he has a chance.
So far James Gray and Wallace A. Cook
have carried off the honors. Last Satur
day Gray beat McNaught and Cook beat
McLaren. The losers have been consid
ered almost certain to meet in the finals
and consequently their defeat, which in
each case was accomplished rather easily
was a great surprise. The Graysâ Joseph
and Jamesâ have shown great skill and
are almost sure to meet in the semi
finals. A good match will, result when
they come together. The Cook-Moffatt
macth should also be. a. close one, with
the odds slightly favoring Cook. Joseph
Gray will meet McLachlan to-day. The
winner will meet James Gray, next Satur
day, when also Cook and Moffatt will
meet. The finals will be played on No
vember 14.

Judge Lawson. while recognizing
Whitson's fastidious taste, thought he
should pay something, as he had used
the carriage, and told the litigants to
cut the bill in half, giving Judgment for
Patrick for $5 and costs to the amount
of $5 50.
â¢Patrick testified that he had received
a telephone message from Whitson to
send him the carriage and he had done
so. Whitson. however, had since posi
tively refused to pay for the carriage.
In his owrn behalf Whitson said that
when the carriage drove up to his house
he did not like the appearance of the
coachman, so he sent the team back.
"The coachman was shabbily dressed."
said Whitson, "and I declined to allow
him to drive my wife and myself
throagh the park, owing to his generally
disreputable appearance. I told him to
take the carriage to the stable and he
did so. Then Patrick sent him back
again, but his attire had not been im
proved."
J. J. Whitson. president of the Wat
sonvllle Gas Company, appeared in Jus
tice of the Peace Lawson's court yester
day as defendant in a suit brought by
Harry F. Patrick, a Geary-street stable

to be due for a carriage and horse hired

" The Fort Crook baseball team met de
feat yesterday afternoon for the second
time at the hands of the Presidio nine.
The score stood 20 to 3 at the close of the
game. Lieutenant Victor Lewis, manager
of the Presidio Athletic Club, stated yes
terday that he is ready to match his nine
with any amateur team on the coast for
a purse of $1000.
The Fort Crook team claimed the cham
pionship of the army before coming out
here and challenged' the Presidio team
immediately on their , arrival. The first
game was played last week and resulted
in a victory for the Presidio men by a
score of 6 to 5. The defeated nine asked
for a return match', and j yesterday they
certainly got it.
From the opening of the game the home
boys showed the best work, and at the
end of the second inning the visitors had
to put a new man in the box. .
Dr. Strong umpired the jj game for . the
first two innings, but made a decision that
caused much dissatisfaction on the part
of the visitors. He was relieved by. Cap
tain White, who officiated during the re
mainder of; the game. \,
In the seventh inning the score stood
18 to J), with two men ' on " basea and Pre
sidio at the bat. For the first time â¢, dur
ing the game the Crook team held: their
opponents down and in -.the last half of
the Inning, scored -three runs. ,
The Fort Crook team \ is I leaving this
afternoon for 1 the ; Philippines and will
probably ask -for. more matches on their
return to this city. The line-up: ,

open stake. The first round and half the
second round will be run to-day. The
running of this stake will be resumed to
morrow at 10:30 o'clock. The likely win
ners look to be:

hounds. This is the largest stake ever
run east of California. All the California
dogs won their first course. They included
Lord Brazen, Laughing j Water, White
Hat, Rocker Arm, Charming Thought,
Consort, Talk To Me, Cloudburst and
Sweet Emma.
THE Junior Champion stake, one of
the fixed events in the leashman's
year, will be decided to-morrow at
Union Coursing Park. The stake has at
tracted added interest this year, as Henry
J. Crocker has presented an artistic cup,
which will go to the winner. The entries,
which include the pick of the young grey
hounds of the coast, are so evenly
matched as to give the stake an unusu
ally open look.
The unknown quantity in the stake is
the Petaluma hound In Time, by Fortuna
Favcrte-Forest Queen. He is owned by
A. McLeod and has never been seen in
public. In the preparation of him for this
meeting Mr. Mcl^eod has had the assist
ance of Messrs. Healy and Sheridan, two
of the best informed coursing men in the
West. Many good ones have come out of
Petaluma, and this one may live up to
the traditions.
T. J. Cronin's Fair Tralee will be a
starter, but he is not expected to do him
self full justice owing to his recent in
juries.
The running will commence upon the
arrival of the 10:15 a. m. train to-morrow.
There will also be trains at 11. 12 and 1

The handicap" doubles tournament for
the three-time cups, which was set f or â¢ a
week ago Sunday on the California Club
courts/will be played one week from to
morrow. Hereafter , these { events * will be
played as - scheduled. Tournaments held
by other: clubs will not.be allowed to In
terfere. The clubs will . probably get to
gether and arrange schedules so as not to
conflict with each others' dates.
There will be several new teams in the
next tournament..; Smith and MacGavin
will ' not play ; together, nor will . Collier
and Mitchell. MacGavin and Mitchell will
join forces, as- wlir.the Smith -brothers.
The* latter make a strong combination
in a handicap event. They won the Davis
cups the" last four times straight. ; Mac-
Gavin and Mitchell should couple up well.
They will probably be ! the; only .scratch
team. , Dr. Hill and Will ; Allen;' the
ners of the last tournament, .will play; to

THE winter season in tennis has
fairly started on both sides of
the bay and the ever-increasing
attendance on the courts is an indication
it will be the liveliest season on record.
New members are coming into both of the
clubs and the old ones are taking more
interest in tournament play than hereto
fore. The East Oakland Club started the
ball rolling last Sunday with a handicap
doubles for loving cups. There was a
large entry list and the handicaps were
well regulated so that most of the
matches were close. Heath and Hunter
and Biddle and Hotchkiss, two of the
scratch teams, met in the finals and after
each had won two long sets a coin was
tossed and Biddle and Hotchkias were de
clared the winners. They won the third
and fourth sets, while their opponents
won the first and second. These tourna
ments are similar to the ones being held
at the California Clttb courts and are very
popular with the members.
The record-breaking .handicap singles
tournament, commenced on the Golden
Gate Park courts several weeks ago, will
be completed to-morrow. Four players
have won a place in the semi-finals, which
will be played off in the morning. Clar
ence Griffin (owe 2-6) will meet Herbert
Long (3-C), and Will Allen (owe 15 2-6)
will be opposed to George Janes (scratch).
Allen and Long are California Club
players, while Griffin and Janes are two
of the original park players. The odds
somewhat favor the park men and the
chances are one of them wUl win. Of the
four Griffin's chances undoubtedly look
the best. He played a great game last
Sunday, when he received a handicap. If
he can play the same game to-morrow,
giving, a handicap, he should beat Long.
It is expected the odds will worry him.
as he Is not accustomed to giving them.
Long is a streaky player, at times bril
liant and at others poor. If he is play-
Ing his best game he can beat his oppo
nent with the odds allowed him. .
â¢While many consider it a certainty that
Janes will beat Allen, those who are in
a position to know are of the opinion
that'; the scratch man will just about nose
him out. Allen has several times demon
strated his ability to allow odds. He
plays a steady game and has lots of
nerve, two things essential in handicap
play. The park contingent figure that as
Janes beat MacGavin he should have no
trouble beating Allen, who does not rank
nearly so high as MacGavin: The latter
almost beat Janes and was not feeling
well at that. MacGavln's , game Is not
suited to handicap conditions, as he takes
too many chances. -The' finar match will
be played at 2:30 and will be three sets
out of. five.
Last Sunday ; the fleet of the Oakland
Canoe Club sailed from Sessions Â¦ Basin
to the anchorage of the Enclnal Yachting
and Boating Club at. Alameda. enjoying
smooth watt r and a pleasant breeze.
H. R. Simpkins' yawl Tramontana,
which has been used as a houseboat dur

the beach at Old Sausalito. The sloop
Queen and the yawl Phyllis will be taken
up Corte Madera Creek to Escalle. J. R.
Savory's* aloop Juanlta and the yawl
Royal will enter the lagoon at Tiburon.
The members of the California Yacht
Club brought the season to a close last
Saturday with an impromptu jinks and
supper at their clubhouse on Oakland
Creek. During the evening the prizes won
at the various club races held during the
past season were presented to the win
ners, Robert Vincent of the yawl Iola,
Charles E. Clark of the .yawl Gypsy,
Julian Altendorf of the yawl Pilgrim and
S. S. Marshall of the sloop Thelma. Au
gust R. F. Brandes, chairman of the re
gatta committee, made the presentations,
the winners ' being heartily cheered by
those present.
. Last Sunday the closing cruise of the
season was taken, the boats being towed
out into the bay, where a light breeze'en
abled the yachtsmen to hoist sail. After
passing and saluting Commodore George
M. â¢ Shaw's - flagship Idler the yachtsmen
put ' about for their moorings in the creek.
Allen M. Clay, owner of the sloop Pac
tolus and one . of the best known yachts
men on San Francisco Bay, has been ill

chiefly for the purpose of duck-shooting.
The members of the South Bay Yacht
Club will hold a clambake at the club
house at Alviso to-morrow and will then

Athletic Club eleven to-morrow on tha
Berkeley campus. The visitors will show
on the field with such veterans as Mr.
Mlllan and "Chef Murphy and will give
the varsity a fight to win. The team
has been well trained under McMillan
who Is raptaln. coach, manager and right
half. The varsity will ii ne up: Stroud
center; Overall, right guard; Stow left
fT"? 1 ?, eltmuller . nsht tackle; Howard,
left tackle; Oliver, right end; Demerit*

Forse. full. ' *
"The line is stronger to-day than it was
a week ago." said Coach Whipple to-day.
"We are trying out men right along to
see if we can't make It stronger. The
backs are getting off their feet faster
than they did. though they do not seem
to be as sure as they should be. The men
are in good condition, however and in
time they will be all right."
The game against the alumni this week
did not prove anything against the var
sity, as the ten-minute halves did not per
mit of any heavy scoring. There la
nothing easy about making touchdowns In
ten minutes, even with scrub elevens.
Besides the alumni eleven waa composed
of stars which would stop almost any
thing that came in its way.
In the game with the Chemawa Indians
the varsity did not evea get good prac
tice. The team was altogether too light
to do anything against the oprxjslng
heavyweighs. A gamÂ© of that kind al
ways hurts the varsity, because there Is
no hard fighting to do to get through.
Belknap got into the game again to-day
after being out of it for two weeks on
account of a strained ligament. At onÂ»
time it was thought he was on the hospi
tal list for good. "Johnny" Mora has been
taking his place at quarter in the practice
games, but in the alumni and Indian
games Geary and Boothe were tried out.
The plaster cast waa removed from
Harry Hudson's leg to-day and the limb
may be well enough for him to play again
before the season gets too far advanced
Clary and Oliver have been filling his
place at right end. Demeritt is takine
care of left end. *
BERKELEY, Oct. 30.â There has
been a noticeable improvement In
the playing of the varsity team
this week. The line is not quite all that
it ought to be and the backs, though get
ting faster all the time, are a little un
certain, but these kinks will be taken out
In the two weeks of practice that remain
between to-day and thÂ© day of the Inter
collegiate game.
A feature of Wednesday's game com
mented on by those who watched it care
fully was the lack of both Interference
and support given the man carrying the
ball. Not infrequently on a line buck
the man with the ball would get through
for several yards only to be carried back
by the Indians because there was no one
behind him to back him up. Fumbling
has also been far too frequent among the
varsity players, considering the fact that
the big game is but two weeks distant.
In the game with the Nevadans the
fumbling was inexcusable, and possibly
prevented Stanford from winning the con
test. * ' ''>." : --Â» :\- Â¦Â¦
The problem of getting a man to do the
kicking for the big team is still perplex
ing the coaches. Hyde, a candidate for
halfback, who promised earlier in the sea
son to be a star performer in this depart
ment of the game, has fallen down hope
lessly in his punting. Sprott, left tackle,
whom the coaches have been endeavoring
to develop into a place-klcker, has also
proved a failure and it is evident that If
Stanford is to score against California on
November 14, it must do so through
straight line-bucking or end-running, a
proposition that will not prove at all easy
considering the weight and efficiency of
the veteran blue and gold line.
Stanford's line is not as strong as it
should be considering the amount of
coaching the men have . had since the
season opened. Thompson, Hauverman
and Sprott are the only men that have
played consistently in varsity form. In
the game with Nevada the right side of
the line was visibly weak, notwithstand
ing the fact that the rival linesmen were
of approximately the same weight. The
sagebrush men "got the Jump" on- their
opponents nearly every time the ball waa
passfed, showing the Nevada 1 players have
followed Coach Steckle's teaching better
than the Stanford men have answered
Coach Lanagan's demand for speed.
Big Jim Weller has been out of the
game the greater part of the week with
a bad knee. He Is recovering . rapidly and
will be seen behind the line next week.
"Savage" Dole reappeared In the lineup
again this week, playing daring a part of
the game against the Chemawa Indians.
"Stump" Stott, who captained the fresh
man team and played a. brilliant game,
;is playing as near varsity form as any
man on the field at present. His work
In ; the game Wednesday showed to an
advantage. He is not only a good field
general, but also a clever individual
player.
To-morrow afternoon at 3:30 the varsity
will meet the Reliance eleven on the Stan
ford gridiron in . their last contest of the
season -with the clubmen. 'After Stan
ford's showing against , Nevada . it is im
possible to forecast the result,, although
Stanford ought to find it easier to defeat
Reliance now than it did in the Â¦ last
game. - I
The Nevada game apparently started
the havoc, or at any ratw, the varsity nas
been Milling backward ever since that
contest. They are slowâ painfully slow to
the spectators, who paid their good money
to see a good exhibition of the college
sport. The second eleven is quite evi
dantly able to run plays off more rapidly
than the first team men. This was notice
able in the game with the Chemawa In
dians on Wednesday. It was not until
after practically the entire second team
was facing the redskins that anything
approaching fast football was played.
The men, after a scrimmage, were slow
to return to their places, the signals were
given even more slowly and the gains
were made, not through any clever nor
fast work on the part of the Stanford
players, but because of the inferior work
and ignorance of the game on the part cf
the Indians.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 30.
âThe practice 1 work of the Stan
ford University football eleven, as
weil as the showing made in the last two
games, has been a source of considerable
disappointment to the students on the
bleachers. In the early part of last week
the big fellows were playing in a way
that spoke well for the possibilities of
this year's team. This week they have
put up a game Inferior in every respect
to the work they were doing ten days
ago.

A b&ck horse could have run almost
as "fast as did Pilon, winner of the first
running event, but the old gelding waa
the good thing in the betting and came
through. He went to the post at 8 to 5,
and, catching .Gusto before the, latter
horse had traveled the length of a trolley
oar, won ridden out from Eva D, the
second choice. Toltec finished third.
a dozen lengths separated Cazador
from the balance of the field at the'eon
cluslon of the six-furlong scramble fol
lowing. Cazador was a 4 to 1 chance and
ran over the leaders In the brush home,
winning. in a gallop. Ismad, the 8 to. 5
favorite, ran a fair race, leading out Con
nell for the place. Midget blew up after
leading for two-thirds of, the distance.-
Little Lewis on Billy Moore came within
an ace of tossing off the six and a half
furlong selling affair. He had the 5 to 1
chance in front at the end of the grand
stand and was to all appearances win
ning easily. Then the youngster began
watching the inside horses and. not per
ceiving Knapp coming with a rush on
the outside with Blue Miracle, won by a
head only. Cherries which closed equal
favorite with Blue Miracle, ran third.
At last Grail displayed some trace of
her best form. The mare closed equal
favorite with Chub for the final mile tell
ing run and registered a very handy win
ner in 1:40%, after Jackson 'on Constellator
had cut out all the pace. Chub had rood

ehoot over one these rare Indian summer
ohvs. From ail directions wherever there
are fresh water ponds come reports of
limit bags.
Old-time pportsmen are surprised at the
number of canvasbacks in the upper bay.
Several limit bags have been secured on
these birds, something unheard of here
tofore at this season of the year. The
fcprtg are unusuaJiy numerous on the
Country Club preserves near Point Reyes.
The preserve owners are enjoying the
cream of the Bhootlng now, but with the
first big storm the unattached sportsmen
will have their turn at the came birds.

Club's ponds at Colllnsvllle last Sunday.
The bag for the three guns was 141 birds.
Included in these were about fifty "cans."
The members of the party also enjoyed
some enipe shooting.

NEW YORK, Oct. SO.â Barring
what were characterised as "re
versals." the racing at Aqueduct
to-day was excellent. "William C. Whit
ney, in order to ece for himself just how
Caseidy's starts are made, went over to
the starting 1 post for the second race, in
Â¦which his filly Mineola was started, and
had the satisfaction of seeing the best
start of the day. la which the whole field
of eleven ran in a close bunch for about
a furlong, after -which they began to
string out..
Ice Water won the opening race, ridden
by Troxler. Redfern was evidently not un
der "waiting orders" when he rode Oars
man, for he went right out in front at a
pare which eventually caused the fastest
â¢-imÂ«Â» for a mile ever run over the Aque

Mirthful filly. WltXul, picked up
111 pounds in the fourth and fea
ture race to-day and covered the circle in
1:29 1-5, beating- Toah by a head. Wltful
was a prohibitive "favorite at 2 to 3,
backed from. 1 to 2. but horsemen were of
the opinion that had Adklns made his run
sooner he might have beaten the favorite,
as he was gaining fast at the end and
two jumps beyond the wire was in front.
The race was one of the fastest run at
the meeting. Coruscate carried the field
along at a fast clip for a half-mile. At
the far turn Wltful, which was last
rounding the first turn, ran around her
field, took command and, coming on, won
rather handily by a head.
General Steward, the favorite at 3 to 1,
won the fifth race by a head and was
then promptly disqualified because his
Jockey, J. Booker, whipped Ralph Youitg
over the nose all through the stretch,
causing him to stop. This gave the raoc
to Ralph Young.
The track was at Its best, the weather
waa clear and cool and 4he attendance
above the Friday average, probably be
cause the racing season around Chicago
ends to-morrow and the programme ar
ranged for "getaway" day Is about the
best of the meeting. Summary:

one without the aid of a base hit. McKay

Hitt passed ten men to first base in four
innings. lie was so lucky the . Senators
secured only one runoff him and got It
by a scratch. The. budding southpaw
could not throw the ball within yards of
the plate. He had a world of speed and
when he did put 'em over the Senators
could not-land. This sort' of thing could
not go on forever, thought Pete, so he
chased Hitt and ordered the M. D. out to
the middle of the lot.
. Moskiman , was in good form and the
Senators . did not make any more .' runs.
They secured five hits oft Doc and two
of these came in the ninth rQund, but out
side of that there was no damage done
and the Cripples held their lead as soon as
they got their last run.
The first Cripple tally came over in the
seventh,' when young McKay tore off a
double to right and O'Hara beat out a
bunt." Moskiman gladdened the hearts of
the Oakland admirers with a swell two
bagger out to -the left field fence and
McKay tore home. O'Hara tried to do
likewise, but a' relay throw nailed him
at the pan.
THE Cripples got away with the
game yesterday, at Recreation
Park, though their, chances were
selling at about 100 to ( 1. They
had .about all V" e luck that is

PORTLAND. Or. Oct. SO.-When thÂ»
steamship Algoa sails from, this port next
week she will have stored away In her
hold the largest flour cargo that ever IefÂ£
the United States. It will amount to 85.000
barrels and not only will be a record
breaker for Portland, but for the entira
country. At present a steamer oiv tha
Atlantic coast holds flrst place.
The wharf at which the Algoa is load-
Ing was too amall to hold all the flour
that was put on board the vessel. Tha
wharf was packed to its full capacity
with flour and after all of this had been
put on the steamer she still had carrying
capacity to spare. Several carloads more

"No, sir." :
- ." You , had ', not at any tlme'of the afternoon
made up your reckoning to ascertain where the
ship- might* be?"
"No.^slr.'.' , * . .
."Dirt the captain clve *)u any reckoning at
noonthe day of the wreck?".' Â¦.-; ;â¢'.-
and how many did you pick up?
"There were two men in the boat and one
hang-ins - on. I picked up two men and a
boy."
"Did the women in the boat sink Imme
diately?" Z:
"No, sir: I saw them floating. Mrs. Bent
waa floating face up with arms outstretched,
and appeared to be dead. They had life pre
servers on. They were strapped on."
"Did vou make an attempt to find those
people after you got control of the boat?"
"Yes; hut we couldn't handle the boat in
the wind and sea. We lay by a while and.
hearing no cries, started for the beach. I had
seven people In the boat then."
At this stage of the Investigation Mate
Bruce was out on the stand and testified
that the compasses were : ad justed. He
told of the trip down the coast the day
of the wreck and said that the weather
was very thick. S "I took repeated sound
ings in the fog," said Bruce, "but didn't
make any reckonings of our position other
than referring to the log," he said.
"Was it not a rule to make a reckoning
when you -went off watch?" was asked.
"Yes, sir." . ',
"Was it not more important that you
should do this in foggy weather than In'
fair?" '
"Yes, sir. I got my position by the log
astern."
"You did not know by your reckoning
how far offshore you were?" .
Â¦"I. got soundings at noon, no bottom,
and concluded that I was. well off shore."
Captain Bolles then questioned him In
regard to the reliability of the lead and
line which he had been using for'sound
ing and made him finally admit that it
was not as reliable as the patent sound
ing tubes. Bruce further said [ he took
the last sounding at '4 o'clock and got
seventy fathoms. He had a look/uit ahead,
but he , could -not see more than a hun
dred yardsahead. "I think we struck
on the outer sunken reef orf Cape Blanco,
the reef to the westerly and I southerly
of the p^lnt. We struck at 4:40," he said.
When asked if he had noticed any dif
ference in the water just before the ves
sel struck or had noticed any kelp, he
replied -that he "had not? noticed; any. dif
ference until the moment ' she â¢ struck.
According to the . mate's story he f ran
from " seventy-five fathoms . Into â¢ thirteen
fathoms, the depth around the reef, * in
forty minutes! He Â¦ fixed the speed at 7%
knots and said that the jar was very light
and he had no idea that it would do the
damage it did. ' .. â¢ . Â¦ Â¦Â¦- â¢ Â¦
i Bruce was then ; asked the following
questions:

"Before you left you gave orders to abandon
the ship. Why wasn't she" abandoned at that
time?"
"I supposed she waa being abandoned."
Â¦;Were the men in the engine-room notified to
abandon the ship?"- â¢â¢ ' â
"Yes; I told the mate to tell them."
"Why didn't you notify them?". ,
"I -was all ready to lower my boat. The
other boat was ready, too. The reason I took
the port boat was because it contained the pas
eengera. I know every bit of the beach around
there,' and because of that I thought It would
be best to save as many-lives as possible." Â¦
"That was the reason you took command of
the boat,' was. it?" ,
- "Yes. sir." Â¦ *
"Don't you think as the master it was your

lowered and the proper officers in them?"

I thought them capable of looking out for
themselves." g^a-^ifcis â¢ i

as a seaman to handle that boat?"

tell him to remain, near ,by after he "had

"Did that not Increase the danger to keep
that wheel going while you were lowering the
boats?"
- "Yes. I think It did."
"Did you give orders to stop her?"
"As soon as I came on deck." -
"Before you went Into the boat you knew
that the engines were* going ahead. Did you
speak to the engineer at the time you went be
"What did you say?".
"I Bald I thought we were off the Coqullle
and if we . could steer her we might get In
closer." "
"At the time the boat was lowered. If the
ship had been stopped and the people had had
life I preeirvers, would not more have - been
saved?"
"No, sir; there were life preservers in the
boat." â¢ Â¦ . .. Â¦
Captain Mclntyre testified that there
were plenty of life preservers, and that
the women had life preservers on and
that First Officer Bruce put them on. He
said that the engines were .not moving the
boat ahead, as the propeller was almost
out of water. He admitted that he left
the ship knowing that there were three
men in_ the engine-room, and gave them
no orde'rs to leave, but said that he told
the mate to call them up. The captain
said that the reason that he left the ship
before all of the crew was off was that ha
wanted to j save the main crowd of the
passengers, who were ail in one boat.
The move, he said, was planned during a
consultation with the flrst mate. He
knew the shore off which he was wrecked
and considered himself better capable of
landing the passengers than any one else.
First Officer Bruce testified that he had
been on watch the day of the wreck and
that he had made no ' reckoning to ascer
tain the location of his vessel, but had
determined it by sounding. Getting no
bottom he considered that he was well oft!
shore. Later in the day when lie got sev
enty fathoms he still made no reckoning
as to the vessel's whereabouts. The mate
sustained the captain in most of his tes
timony and stated that he did not think
that Mclntyre left the boat through fear,
but in order to save i.he passengers.
Bruce's testimony showed that he actetl
coolly and did all in his power to save
lives. He gave no bell for the ship to
go ahead after stopping her at the time
she struck and did not think that she
she was moving through the sea at the
time the boats were launched.
The first mate' then described the
launching. â¢Â¦ and subsequent capsizing of
the lifeboats, and his version of the
story showed that the capsizing was <iue
to a jammed rope and not to the fact
that the steamer was going ahead.
THE CAPTAIN'S STOBY.
The captain was first put on the stand.
He said that the ship was properly
equipped with life preservers, arranged as
follows in the bunks "of each berth:
Fourteen in the forecastle, twelve in the
first cabin and thirty In . the after space
used as the steerage. He said there were
six passengers In the steerage and .six
passengers and a child in the cabin. He
then described the launching of his boat
and the capsizing. The story was thus
told by questions and answers:
"Was the chip going ahead at the time?"
asked the inspectors. . /
"Not at all, sir."
"If the engines were running, why wasn't
the ship moving ahead?"
"We had the ship stopped and around on the*
port helm until she was In o nor'westerly
swell and heading a choppy sea. Her head was
well down and the stern well up, until you
could 6ee the propeller's hub. The boat made
elgh't knots at best and in heavy weather about
nve or five and a half knots, when in trim.
Her engines were going round, but she had no
headway and acted as a w.eather vane in the
wind. I don't think there were any fires put
in her furnaces from the time she struck until
the flrst boat was launched, a period of about
twenty-five minutes."
"If the ship had no headway .why couldn't
you have thrown lines to the people In the wa
ter?" " -
"Because the swell threw them back from
the ship."
The investigation instituted Thursday
by. Inspectors, of Steam Vessels Bolles
and Bulger to fix if possible the blame for
the wreck of the steamer South Portland
on the afternoon of October 19 off Cape
Blanco, and to* ascertain the truth of the
charges made against Captain Mclntyre
for alleged criminal neglect of his pas
sengers and crew, was continued yester
day afternoon.
The accused '..captain was plainly un
nerved by the rigid cross-examination he
was subjected to. and more than once his
eyes filled with tears under the merciles3
fire.

I 1 == NOVEMBER l.-s I
With Schreyer's Marvelous Picture ~f
"FLEEING FROM TrjE FLAMES" I
I "FLEEINQ FROM THE FLAMES." j
A wild, unreasoning panic often seizes upon men in the presence of u
danger, or even when danger is only imagined. Among the lower ani- R
mals the greater the intelligence they possess the more they are sub- 1 1
; ject to terror. It is said that elephants tremble at the sight of a mouse, H
and horses, which aro credited with more intelligence than most domes- } j
'Â¦ tic animals, show more fear. â ij
m - In the picture of Adolph Schreyer, reproduced in The Call art sup- ' i
1 plement, there is vividly depicted a stampede of terror-stricken horses 8
\ from a burning stable. In their blind gallop into the darkness they have H
crashed into a barrier and are plunging and struggling in confusion, l\
some entangled in the splintered wood, while others crowd upon them. It [Â¦]
, . is a scene which gave the artist abundant opportunity for dramatic effect |j
â¢ and vigorous action. He has also displayed his ability as a colorist. In f!
its variety and richness of color the greatest merit lies, and its color H
makes this picture one of the artist's masterpieces. . h
Romantic tendencies are strong in all of Schreyer's painting, and 0
sentiment, color and effect were more important to frfm than accurate n
\ draftsmanship. He possessed the power to express strongly what he felt [J
more than the ability to depict truthfully what he saw. U
"Fleeing From the Flames" is owned by the Chicago Art Institute, [j
| and is included in the splendid collection bequeathed to the museum by â¢ [*
I the late Albert A. Hunger in 1898. H

The Egrg market is about as vague as thÂ»
Butter market. The quotations below repre
sent the bulk of the- business, though somÂ«
dealers reported that they were getting mow
in a small. way.- Receipts are not large, but
buyers continue to hold off and stocks are In

There is no change whatever in Che*s*.

. Accurate quotations for Butter are â¢ difficult
fo give at - present. ; as dealers are widely at
variance in their reports owing to the uneven
distribution of : stocks. The heavy receivers
are quoting a weak and quiet market at 29c
for the best creamery, while those who are
carrying small stocks are firm at 30c and even
quote 31c for special brands; Under these con
ditions It is largely, a case of averaging up
the quotations. Those below.com* about as
near to the > general -market as possible. The
receipts were quit* large again yesterday, as
will be eecn..

, Another car of Western Poultry was on sale,
making the fifth for the current week. The

the recent arrivals of Western are rather poor

young Turkeys were very heavy and there was
$l sBarp drop in prices. A few smair lots of
dressed stock came in and were offered at 20Â®

This little tad has reached an age x
He ought to study printed page,
Though hardly old enough, you know.
To public school to dally go.
A governess his ma should get
And have no 4 further cause to fret
Lest the deaf lad become too wild,
For. then he'd be a model child. -
If she will look The Call's Ads through,
As any wise mamma would do,
She'll find In them, we boldly say,
A governess who'll suit each day.jvAnd 1 ! still; there is < more' to Jnterest you. For instance, therejsthe
thir4 ( installment of the "Golden. Fetich," '.which tells you .more of the
Africa of : to-day than . has ;- been revealed by any explorer [ since the .. great
Stanley gave his discoveries to the world. Then there is "The Cough in
Lower, Seven," by Frank H.^ Spearman, which is as fasciriatingly'myste
rious; as i the] title ! itself. 'andâ but of courseybu know' what . excellent
railroad . ; stories Â¦ Spearman < writes. Then there are the "Me-ows of a
Kitty," : clever,; witty, .'charming little bits ' that you will quote to all .your
friends-r-and ; your; lover. -'And ' the "Drawing-room Gowns for Winter";
and ;the, beautifur "Child: Model.", (This ; is a; full-page picture that will
make thesame strange appeal to" you that; it /does to everyone"; else . who
has seen it.) BRHHr^HSflflPQBBBBfflBB^^^ P^S9lwi4
â¢ Butâ and, here is genuine news for. youâ do you know about the big
Â¦ golden , j ubilee of' the Catholic ' \ Church that will be celebrated in this
city nextjSundayMt will .begone, of the most notable events in % all the
ihistory.Vof ;the i church r in i this v State. v-.This'' article * has , been '-Â¦ written
specially and exclusively for the Sunday Call.
.*! AVE you ever seen the new "whizzeTs" and felt the almost mad-
L-J dening thrill of seeinsr them go flying -by* like meteors? The
J^ j sensation is stranjre beyond description, as- strange as the. new
. +S "whizzers" themselves, which are -monsters of the most freakish
sort â monsters the like of which never were seen before. And how they
sing as they go! And with what terrific speed they cleave the air! 'Just
think . of .annihilating distance at the rate of less than a mile a minute !
That is how the "whizzers" go. Long, lean and low like a gray wolf
some of them are, while others. speed on their way like ghostly wraithsâ
but'* with such catapult swiftness ;that the senses are first bewildered and
then intoxicated. It is a sensation that nobody ever escapes. If you do
you will be as^superhuman as the new "whizzers". themselves. â¢
Of course you haven't* felt the, thrill yet, for. the new Vwhizzers" hare
not yet reached San Francisco. - . But they are comingâ coming fast now
âand next week the town will be full of them. And if you don't know
what a "whizzer" is like it is a foregone conclusion that you will buy the
next Sunday Call, which will print two full pages telling you all about
th"emâ where they come fromi why : they are here and where the> are
going and, best of all, what keeps them always in such a tremendous
hurry.'and why they, sing soas they go. ilndeed the new "whizzers"
will simply fascinate you.
.' Almost as remarkable as the "whizzers" is the new artillery drill now
performed by Uncle; Sam's boys in blue stationed in â¢ the VVest. Just
think of seeing a battery of light artillery go- clattering and bumping
over.the ruts of a. stubble field and after. careening madly around a shock
of^new-mown hay come into action, shoot holes into;a dense fog and
knock | into T; smithereens the .kneeling figure .of a man four miles away,
which ;"they\ could 'not see by a good two mile3. 'And yet it is not so much
whatjthey "do asithe-way-they accomplish such * remarkable shots that
makes 'the! new. field drill truly wonderful. Ju%t;-see'the pictures in the

Industrial activity has increased some

pending labor controversies have reached
amicable adjustment, adding to the ag
gregate of wage-earners employed. On
the > other ' hand, strikes are ordered . and
some mills will be closed by lack of .new
business, while the fight for control' of
the copper properties has thrown thou
sands'out of work. While there is evi
dence of a setback in the steel Industry,
some hesitation in textiles In the East, the
general tenor of these reports is encour
aging for a continuance of prosperity, par
ticularly from the sections where agricul
ture is tha chief occupation. Collections
are causing some uneasiness and financial
conditions are unsettled. Merchandise is
freely distributed, earnings for Â¦ October
thus far surpass last year's 'by 5.9 per

The result shows once again how a real
ly original invention cannot pour itself
into another's mold. Scqtt returned to his
own poetical manner in "Rokeby."
"Rokeby" was coldly Received and thpn
Scott turned his thounghts to fiction In
prose, came -upon hia , long lost fragment
of "Waverley and the need of conciliating
the poetic taste of the day was at an end
forever.
In 1809, when "Childe Harold" appeared,
Crabbe's supremacy with the public came
to an end. But he remained a great fa
vorite, not only with the public, but ever
after his popular reclame wa3 over with
the poets and the critics. Canon Alnger
cites the encomiums of Scott, Words
worth, Byron and Tennyson. He reminds
us that critics differing as widely as Ma
caulay. Cardinal Newman, Swinburne,
Edward FltzGerald and Leslie Stephen
have found In Crabbe an insight into the
springs of character and a tragic power
In dealing with them of a rare kind.
Nevertheless, his popularity with tne
world at large has waned. The appear
ance of the two volumes of Tennyson in
1842 did much to divert attention from
poetry, so widely different. Â¦â¢ To-day Crabbe
nas almost entirely disappeared from the?
list of poets whom every educated lover
of poetry is i expected to appreciate. Can
on Ainger explains why. "No. doubt
Crabbe demands something of his readers.
He asks from them a corresponding in
terest."
Â¦ When Crabbo Dublished hlÂ» "Paxljh
Register" In the autumn of 1S07 the noTelÂ»
of the day were largely th*- vapid pro
ductions of the Minerva Press, without
atmosphere, color or truth. M:sÂ« Kdge
worth alone had already strode the not*
of a new development in her "Caatle
Rackrent," not to mention tho delightful
stories in "The Parents*-.^Assistant."
Gait's masterpiece, "The Aanalslof : thÂ»
Parish," was not yet even lying unfinished
In his desk. The J.rucklehackltf and the
HeadrlEgs wer^ jMU further distant. MlsÂ»
Mitford's aicet^hes ' in'. ','Oiir^:WiIIaife"â thÂ«V
'nearest'; in form to' Crmbtte^s pictures of
country life-were to corao later still.
Cr&bbe, : though Mi adhered, with s> irtso
knowledge of his vown ' >p6wers.^ufs tho

opinion, Â» chief founder of the rural

Cratibc's dohlavcmont" wai practlcaily a
new Sthtng. Tho 'success of Â¦ Â¦. the' 'Parish
Register' was Urprely that of a new ad
venturoi In the^ world of fiction. Whatever
defectn. the critic of pure poetrj* â¢ might

realism that could not be doubted and for
â¢iS* 1 *^ that; could: riot be unshared. 1 '. - : ; Â¦
vjTha.VPdrfBh Register". had an enormous
.effect upon .the literature of Crabbo's day.
Byronhad not. yet. burst upon the- world
with the two flret cantos of "Childe Har
old.". But even then Sir Walter. Scott,
who had been the; most' popular of con
temporary poets, was making the unwel
come discovery that his own matter end
Wanner were Imitable and that others
were borrowing them. Many could now
"grow the flower" (or something like Jt)
for "all had grot the seed." It was George
Crabbe who set him to thinking whether
he might not change his topics and his
meter and still retain hia public To this
end he tentatively published an experi
ment called "The Poacher." written in
avowed imitation of Crabbe. To-day it
reads almost like a burlesque of Crabbe.
Yet Scott was no doubt in earnest in as
suring Lockhart that he had been domi
nated by no spirit of travesty, but only
to. test whether he would be likely to suc
ceed in narrative verse of the same pat
tern.
In his essay on Addison Maw;lÂ»r h.H
pointed out how the - Roger di. CoTtrity
papers' gave the Â¦ public ; of n!i day tba
first taste of a new and ezaulfllto pleas*
ure. At tha time â¢'when Fleldlr.fr yrta
blrd-nestlngr and Smollett was. unborn,"
Addison was laying the foundation of the
English novel of real life. .;;Â¦<Â¦Â¦ - l \*"'

ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS
United States District Judge de
Haven Decides Partly In Favor
? of the Hef eTee.
Some weeks ago Jacob Eppinger of the
bankrupt firm of Eppinger & Co. was
asked by Referee Green four questions,
which he declined to answer on the
ground that his answers might tend
to criminate him. Judge de llaven
handed down an opinion yesterday sus
taining the ruling of the referee as to two
"of the questions and reversing his ruling
as to the other two..
/The following are the questions:
1. Who attended to the financial part of
the businees?v
2. Who, If Â¦ any one of the firm, had charge
of the financial department of the business?
3. ' la the firm interested ln a warehouse
business? â¢
4. Was there any one interested in the stock
of the Pacific Coast Warehouse Company other
than the member* of the firm of Ep
plnrcr.& Co.?
Judge de Haven said:
The flrst t\vo questions ruled upon by the
referee do not seem to be very material, but
I am unable to - percÂ«lve Â¦ how answers thereto
would tend to criminate the witness. In re
lation to questions 3 and 4 the ruling of the
referee should be sustained: ' .
The ruling of the. referee ln sustaining thÂ«
objections to questions 1 and 2 Is reversed, and
his rullnc sustaining: the objections to ques

Gompers has . also decided that the
newsboys are laborers and that they. will
be eligible to - membership in the Labor
councils throughout the country and
should receive the support of the " labor
leaders. Gompers ruled, too, that the
junk dealers are in the same class with
the newspaper carriers and that they will
not be allowed to enter, the Labor Council.

A delightful entertainment was given
last nlght/at the South Park Settlement
to a large and appreciative attendance.
One of the main features on the pro
gramme was the Illustrated lecture on
"Gerome, the French Artist," by Miss
Lucile Eaves. The Gerome pictures
shown on the screen by Miss Eaves came
in for much appreciation. Miss Eaves'
lecture was not alone Interesting, but In
structive and full of Information concern-
Ing the artist and his work. Some very
pleasing vocal numbers were rendered by
members of the Cosmopolls Club.

Mr. McCoy said that ail they asked
was the support of citizens In maintain
ing the course of lectures and the musical
and high-class entertainments which the
association provides for the young men
of the city. He dwelt particularly on
the many temptations that abound in the
city. On the other hand the doors of the
Young Men's Christian Association, he'
said, were open .and offering entertain
ment ln the evenings that would later in
life be of strong benefit to the young
men who take the opportunity the asso
ciation gives them to improve and pass
their leisure in a manner that is ele
vating.
An illustrated lecture will be given to
night at the association by the Rev.
Charles A. Payne.
James N. Hatch, superintendent af con

lecture at the Young Men's Christian As
sociation last night entitled "Iron Ore
From Mine to Furnace." There was a
large attendance of the members of the
association and many adults were pres
ent to gain practical knowledge from the
expert lecturer. Mr. Hatch was warmly
applauded at the conclusion of the lec
ture, and during the evening General
Manager McCoy delivered a few words
to the audience, in which he spoke of the
educational and entertaining work which
was going on at the association every
night.

of Tuesday . night." evidently somewhat
sparing herself. But we should be thank
ful for her in any of her moods. TKe
frank Mr. Duss confessed that the or
chestral scores of the Erkel aria first
programme were lacking, and that Mme.
Nordica would sing the "Di Tale Amor"
from "Trovatore" instead. The substi
tution.was welcomed, and charmingly the
singer gave the fine aria. Then she tucked
up her sleevesâ or .rather shed the royal
ermines that 3he femininely came on In -
and her neck ribbonâ to the Erkel aria,
with piano-forte accompaniment. This,
written for her, turned out to be a singu
larly fascinating Slavic song and was giv
en with superb sympathy. The Wagner
"Dich Theure Halle" and "Liebestod" of
Tuesday's concert were both repeated, but
Mme. Nordica was not ln their mood yes
terday. They failed of climacteric vaiuc>,
the radiant abandon of Tuesday's render
ing being almost wholly lacking. She
gave as encore the Â» delightful "Spring
Song" of Oscar Weil, and I hope Mr.
Weil was there to hear it.
Society : Gives Ball in Celebration
,.' of Twenty-Second An
niversary.
The San Francisco Scottish Thistle
Club held Its' twenty-second Halloween
ball last evening in Lyric Hall. --
There were about 200 lads and lassies
on the floor, who danced gayly to Scottish
music played on Scottish instruments.
The evening was opened by the grand
march, which was led by the club's
piper. -. ;
. The hall. was decorated with many
flags and banners and the stage was
draped with a largo flag bearing the
words "Clanna Nan Galdheal An' Gaillbh
A' Chelle."
At the conclusion of the dance the en
tire assembly sang "Auld Lang Syne."
The dance was given under the man
agement of George W. Miller and George
W. Paterson. both of whom are officers
of the club.
MEMBERS OF THISTLE CLUB
.: DANCE. TO SCOTTISH MUSIC
When the detectives arrived on the
scene they found that the burglars had
entered the second story by climbing a
porch ln the rear of "the house. They are
believed to be Eastern crooks, who re
cently came to the coast. Several simi
lar Jobs have been done within the last
few days and they have baffled the
sleuths of the Police Department. All
the crimes have been committed during
the dinner hour, but this is the first ,one
that has been reported from the park
section. All the others have been from
the Western Addition.
Passing through other rooms Fowler
found that the same condition of affairs
prevailed. Bureau drawers had been
pulled out and whatever they contained
was thrown about the floor. Trunks had
been opened and the thieves left no part
of their work undone. Every room on
the second story had been thoroughly
looted and the result was that one ring
end a watch and chain, the property of
one of Mr. Fowler's children, were stolen.
Fowler explains that he keeps but little
jewelry about the house except that
which he and his family wear at all
times.
TbÂ© porch climbers who have been op
eratlziff in this dty for the last two weeks
aptn claim the attention, of the police.
On "Wednesday evening: they entered the
residence of G. AV. Fowler, a clerk In. the
audlt_* department of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company, at l_0 Masonic
avenue, and looted the second story of
the house while the family was at dinner.
The crooks profited little by their crime,
but nevertheless they must have operated
more than an hour in an effort to make
a good haul.
According- to the story told to the po
lice by Fowler he went down stairs with
hie family to dinner shortly before 7
o'clock. Several friends Joined them and
an evening of enjoyment was spent. After
the last course had been served Fowler,
his family and his friends loitered at the
table and it was nearly 9 o'clock before
they' went upstairs again. When the
railroad man lighted the gas ln one of the
rooms he was surprised to find that burg
lars had visited it during his absence.
The contents of the rooms had been scat
tered about and there was every indica
tion of a thorough search having been
made. â¢Â¦--.â¢:?
But there is the sinister ending, "And
on the hearth the cold is fiercely cruel."
And all this Strauss tells with illuminated
cynicism, for prirr.arily the work strikes
one as, intellectual. He has used to tell
the story themes sane and easily appre
hended, a sometimes sinister harmonic
scheme, rhythms original and biting, and
a brihiant play of instrumental color.
The I resulting atmosphere is compelling.
One -'is swept Into the irenetic joy and
shudder of it willy-nilly, drawn bodily
into the deep sweetness of its calmer mo
ments and left wondering after it as to
the wholesomeness of the indulgence. At
any rate, it leaves one with a deep de
sire to hear more Strauss. And . more
Strauss. The orchestra did excellently
here, but at least twice the number of
strings was needed for Its proper balance.
Nordica was yesterday's soloist, and the
size of the house showed It. The famou3
singer was not quite in the brilliant mood
To- me the "Don Juan" possesses im
mediate appeal, at second hearing taking
on even a grace of familiarity. Thistone
poem is the first of the important works
of the composer, 18S8 its date. In all like
lihood therefore Strauss had not yet
sounded the depths of his characteristic
genius., At least "Don Juan" cannot be
called "ugly"; music, the favorite epithet
flung at his later work by the composer's,
detractors. ; Nor is it willfully complex,
nor , grotesquely colored. Â¦ It is written
about a poem of'Nikolaus Lenauâ for it
is frankly programme musicâ with as its
keynote the following lines:
So. long as youth lives on with pulse afire.
Out to the chase! To .victories new aspire!
The /'Lamentoso" went well, the rich
palette of the orchestra giving Its som
ber values with adorable beauty. *And
then came the extraordinary Strauss,
given first at, Stanford on xuesday, then
again on Thursday, evening here and in
response to wide demand repeated at yes
terday's concert.
Though thÂ£ Metropolitan Opera-House
orchestra has almost | persuaded to dis
belief in ; the necessity of a conductor
this week, there are still "times." There
was one at least, at yesterday after
noon's concert, j Extraordinarily this was
not in the Strauss tone poem, that the ac
commodating Mr. Duss substituted by
general * request for the programmed
"Lorna Doone" suite of Nevin. Over this
he waved a coloratura baton without dis
aster, the orchestra going its own way
with delicious sangfroid. It was in the
"Pathetique" symphony that the orches
tra fell' perceptibly short, by a head.
'And how -one regretted Mascagni's!
Mascagni did many things better than
others, but nothing better than the- Alle
gro con Grazia from the . Tschaikowsky
symphony. Yesterday's reading, compar
ably, had the poetry of the multiplication
table.- Nor could this be wondered at.
Some things must have a baton behind
them. - The Con Grazia is emphatically of
the brand. All of the supple pulse of the
movement was lost In â¢ a sort of clock
work stride, that was Indeed the only re-,
source of an orchestra without a head.
And this, the drawling fascination of its
rhythm. Is chiefest charm of the move
ment. Mascagni, with a scratch orches
tra gathered . in from everywhere, . gave
truly more/pleasure in it than this rarest
band of artists. So much for a leader.
But ye gods! How Duss does enjoy him
