they faced one another, there was more

"Yes, certainly this Is no dream. This

He paused for a moment in an atti

tightly c'ayping an Imaginary gun, and
then continued warningly:
At last it was Colonel Graham who spoke
as if he were merely continuing the con

Again he broke off abruptly and made
a great effort at self-control. Sherwood
put' his hand on his shoulder sympatheti

He felt again the tumultuous emotions

melted from his cheeks and his hot blood

had once given him looks of love.
All this had been hard to bear, but
when his little brother George, a boy of

forgot victory, wounds and discipline,
and clasped the warm little figure In his

SlIence> *" do you know any one called Rosalind?"
V i*M WS5Â£&}l ft " Do yÂ° u mJnd telling me who shÂ« lsT"
"Not a bitâ my Youngest sister."
Now, wasn't that like a Scotchman? To ask you a Question that really pre
mised some Interestâ and we wanted all the Interest we could get out of any
thing Just thenâ and then to knock off with a ruminating "Ah!" and nothing
further. Â¦Â¦ Â¦ Â¦ r - *Â¦
"What about Rosalind? Have I been talking of her In my sleep V X
"You? Oh, no! not that I'm aware of!"
"Well, what then?" I persisted.
Layard strode on withput a word; he was a dour, raw-boned Scotchman of
about thirty; a good man to fight, to ride and to endure anything, but not much
of a talker and no company on a toilsome march, or at irksome piece of fatigue
duty. How he had ever come to throw in .his fate with the Yankees had always
puzzled me. But that we should 'have become so chummy during this latter
part of Sherman's famous march to the sea was not less amazing.
Stillâ Rosalind? What could be In his head about Rosalind? I waited, al
moit hungrily, for the name conjured up Irrepressible memories of home.
We -plodded along; the day was very hot and the dust and stones made
heavy going, and by-and-by Layard spoke again, turning his leathery, tanned
face and wistful blue eyes straight to mine.
"Ye* 11 laugh at me, maybe, but I've been dreaming of her every night
latejy!"
"Of my sister Rosalind?'! , t
"Of a girl ca'ed Rosalind. I dldna ken It was your sister, Bennett, but
somehow I felt bound at last to ask you. Wait and I'll tell ye what she's like!
She has a beautiful face, heart-shaped, like an angel In a picture, and very fair
hair falling loose about It, just curling at the ends; her eyes are deep blue, not
pale blue like you see In -Scotland, .but just as deep as violets, and the lashea
and the eyebrows above are black as night! She's pale, not ower strong. I
should. say, and she's but a bit lassie, yetâ sixteen, seventeen at moat." ,
3& my sister Rosalind to a Tâ by Heavens! this Is Interesting! But yon
haven't told me -what -else she's like, tall or short, nor how you came to know
â¢her 'name!"
: "That I can't tell you; I kentlt. may be she said It the first time she ap
peared, but I'm no sure! And for the size of her, 1 anna say either, I only
see her face, naethlng more."*. Ui ';Â¦Â¦
Now, this was very strangeâ stranger than Laytrd knÂ«w! Fter Rosalind, my
little seventeen-year-old' sister, was a cripple. Years back, when she was a tiny
child of about two, there had been a nursery scuffle, and Rosalind had been hurt;
at the time little was thought of the Injury; our nursery was so full of children
that a knock here or there did not count, but presently alas, alas! the mischief
was done, and our little sister was lamed for life. Horace and I always felt bad
about it. though we said nothing, as is the way In big families. And I did not
tell Layard now.
"Do tell me some more. When did she begin coming:? Great Scott. LayartJ. It
is almost as If the dreams had been meant for me, and you got 'em by mistake,
sleeping next me," said L
VI dlnna see that," said Layard, Jealously. , "She never says anything about
you. She Just comes every night, smiling and looking so happy to see me. her
face, with the curling hair, and a necklace of red things, coral beads. I take It.
but cut In a curious fashion, about her throat That Is all I can see of her. but
she seems aye pleased to come, and she listens to what I have to say a' night
â through."
My companion's plain, rough face had a new look In It, now X came to eon*
sider him.
"I've no womenklnd of my own, so It's wonderfu' to me to dream of Rosa
lind." he confessed, and his voice softened. "I'm glad you dldna laugh, Bennett!
I'll tell ye malr about It If there's anything to tell, and I can truly say It's s>
mighty comfort to me to have her face coming the nights!"
I didn't know what to make of It; the thing- bothered me, although Layard,
as far as I knew him, was an honest, decent fellow and thought a lot of women,
whileias for a fighterâ why bis courage alone would have made Sherman's march
memorable.
I had had no home letters from Boston for some time; they were accumulat
ing for me, I supposed, somewhere at the base, while we were cutting a terrible
swath through the South, and I longed for news' of Rosalind. Could it be that she
was In my abnormal condition of mind and was aware of thÂ« link between my
comrade and herself? Anyhow, whether the Imagination were dual or confined
to Layard alone. It was an extraordinary Instance of clairvoyanceâ those coral
beads beat me!
Why, Rosalind had worn them all her lifeâ she was the youngest of us, and,
perhaps owing to her lameness, had never ceased to be the baby!
One day Layard and little Hayes were missing, and a lot of us turned out to
look for them: Hayes was dead when we found them; a rebel bullet had gone
through his brain and killed him on the spot; the enemy, a straggling handful
dodging after their leader, had stripped them of their arms'and left them for
dead. Layard was dead from the waist down, but his head had cleared. I sat
down on the ground beside him and listened (It was no good torturing him by at
tempting removal), and asked myself was he wandering, or what did he see?
"Yes. Rosalind, I'm comingâ you gae first, dear, an' show me" the wayl" he
was whispering softly to himself. "Eh. Bennett. Is that you? I'm sorry, man.
but I must leave you. I meant to see ye home safe, but It's nae to be! And ye'll
be home the noo, but I'll tell Rosalind."
I bent my head, for his voice was very faint; "I'll tell Rosalind, Layard. and
how you liked to think of her, and how we talked of her together," said I,
thinking to please him.
"Why. man, I'll see her first!" said Layard, speaking quickly and with a
smile, as he turned over and died. J
We buried our comrades under, the rock where they fell, and mourned an
hour or two, and then spoke of them more as needs must be In war time. When
presently Grant cornered Lee at Richmond and the war was over, and I. for one.
was among, the first ordered home. I got a whole packet of letters months old,
and some more, that had gone afield, followed me back to the North; but letters
mattered little when I -was homeward bound, and the gaps in my correspondence
did not trouble me!
But there was a gap in the home-clrcla as I looked around at the first mo
ment of arrivalâ Rosalind ! Very gently they broke It to meâ the' wound was
still fresh with them all and they knew that it would spoil my home coming; she
had died of pneumonia after imluenza, a few weeks before.
Mother and the girls were so brave and so determined not to break down that
I took my cue from them and would not show my feelings either: It Is no good
In a big familyâ you simply mustn't gush; but after dinner, when Horace and I
were smoking quietly, he told me one or two strange things. ,
How all through the. winter months Rosalind had talked about "her Scotch
man"âIt was only Horace "whom she told. "'A fair, candy chap, keen of his
duty.' she described. him," said my brother, and I don't know that there was
anything else to say about poor Layard.
â¢' 'The odd thing was that though she was Immensely Interested In this dream
friend of hers, shedidn't want him to come to Boston and make her acquaint
ance. 'You see,. he doesn't know I'm a cripple â wt only know each other's faces.'
she said to me once. 'I guessed he was a soldier from his clothes, and down as
far as my necklace he thinks me quite beautiful: but if he found out I was lams
he would be ; bo disappointed!' ." quoted Horace; and he v ded softly, "We burled
her In her coral necklace.".
; ..vlt told Horace all that I knew, down to those jubilant last words. "Why, man,
I shall see her first!" and we sat silent a while wondering what it meant
: .'.'I am glad you never told him she was a cripple." satd my brother at length;
"here, in this world, the dear little thing would have had to look on at love and
marriage, and all that, and if your friend had come home with you there'd only
have been. heart-break all round! But nowâ I think they've met, don't you,
Harry? and know each other, , or else what was the irood of UT*
And I, who believe that there Is good In most things, think the same.
"You see. it was this way," ea!d one of three or four pioneers who came back
from a hot skirmish that afternoon with momentous news. "We sot word that
the 'rebs' was In the valley, burnln' and pillaging, and we set out to bring the
news, but at the Big Rock a band of Confederates headed us off and we had to
take cover. WÂ« had been standln' them off for two hours and they were gettln'
ready for a rush when that boy officer of yours came chargin' down Ilka a
thunderbolt. He had only his revolver and saber, and after he had emptied his
revolver he used his steel. Bav, now, but he must have wanted to be killed.
He rode among the 'rebs' shootln' and Elashln' and checrln', and be got up such
a panic among 'em that we had a chance to make a sneak. It was no use to
think of belpln" him out. for they were sixty to five. Every one of his bullets

boy bad gone down. Yes, he was only a kid. of a boy, but I'm tellln" you, kur

build him a monument fifty feet high!" â
pany.
"While temporarily under the command of Second Lieutenant Warner fif
teen men were killed or captured. The officer himself escaped by flight"
Such was the wording of the captain's report and of the dispatch sent
broadcast for publication and "The Cub" found himself ostracized. Some of
his brother officers nodded Btiffly to him, while others turned. their backs. The
boy felt tnat be had been put in a false position for a purpose, but he could
prove nothing nor advance any satisfactory explanations. He had obeyed or
ders, but the act of obedience had ruined his career. There was no court of
Inquiryâ no chargesâ no court-martial. He was simply ostracized by the officers
and looked at askance by the privates. There were two remediesâresigna
tion or suicide. It seemed to him that to send In his resignation after a
month's service, and with a campaign still on, smacked of cowardice and he
was no coward. As to the other remedyâ well.
The Twenty-second had not rested thirty days after Chattanooga before
word epread that another terrific battle was Imminent. The regiment must pre
pare to receive the brunt of the fighting again. One, mornlne, as the men were
rushing to and fro while making their preparations, "The Cub" rode away from
the lines alone, and only a sentry or two saw him go. He rode straight down
the valley at a mad gallop for seven miles and then drew rein under the; trees
surrounding a spring. There was but the other remedy left, and he was going
to accept It He had galloped away from all human life to be alone with his
last thoughts and to die by his own hand.
The "rush" came. Fifty ragged but cool and determined Confederates rose
up and dashed forward In a body. The boy did not lose his nerve altogether,
but he was the only one of the seveo or eight living men who was not cap

Little by little Company A was moved to the right, and by and by It
was no longer In support of Its skirmish line. The time came when It was
rifle shot away and when the "grays" took advantage of It to "rush" the ten
men still left alive In the alps and hollows along that front There was cal
culation on the part of the captain â movement on the part of the rebels. "The
Cub" had been given no orders except to advance and attack. He found the
enemy ten to one, but he would not fall back. He realized that his little force
must be wiped out, but he encouraged the men to creep nearer. The time came
when he saw himself unsupported and liable to be cut off. but there was no
backward movement If recalled be would retreat If not he would die on the
firing line.
The Confederates had gathered In force and were strongly entrenched. , War
ner's regiment was rushed forward to open a fight which lasted for three hours.
To accomplish results aimed at the command had to be split up and companies
and squadrons sent here and there to tight on their own hook. \ < .
"The Cub" had been under the eye of every man In Company A slnci the
first shot was fired, and It was admitted that he had kept his nerve as .well
as could be expected. The privates spoke in praise of him to each otherâ the
captain and lieutenant looked at each other and waited. They had not long
to wait A company wu sent far out on the right flank to move up and open
a hot fire, and then there was a smile on the captain's face. To order that boy
to push forward with fifteen men against the hundred Confederates concealed

could not have carried the position. His face paled for an Instant, but then the
color came back and he shut his teeth hard and led the way.
"Damn him. does he want us wiped out to a man!" growled an old ser
geant as bÂ« looked back over his shoulder at the captain. But "The Cub"
hurried the little band forward to their work and five minutes later they were
hotly engaged.
In the days agone. when a boy from the Point was assigned^to a regiment
on the front, he arrived one day to find himself face to face with the enemy the
next. He was given a show, however. His captain or lieutenant kept an eye
on him In his first fight and coached him through it and helped him to keep
his nerve and his hoiftr. Sometimes the boy needed no encouragementâsome
times he would have lost his head and made a spectacle of himself but for the
moral support of the veterans. It Is always an open question as to how a sol
dier, be he officer or private, will conduct himself when he faces death for the
first time on' a battlefield.
Four days after Warner's arrival the command took the field against the
Confederates at Chattanooga. The boy was not yet familiar with the faces of
his brother officers, and he knew nothing of actual warfare except what he had
read. He depended on his seniors to see him through. They had doomed him,
however. They had not plotted and planned, but they had looked into each
other's eyes and nodded their heads. The boy would be "tried out" within a few
days, but he would have to stand or fall alone. He was full of enthusiasm as
the command marched forth, having no doubt of himself and being eager for
his baptism. A soldier Is not a soldier until he has heard the bullets , whistle
about his ears. It Is not years of service, but wounds that give him respect and
dignity.

l^ta^aa-gBBg-^r^ askance. The captain himself had a son who had failed to
pass at the Point, and this had rankled and embittered him,
and his llentenant had taken up his cause.
An hour later the officer was put Into a room by himself and told that at
daylight he would be started for headquarters under escort. He was awake and
alert at daybreak. When the corporal's guard came to lead him forth, he fought
his last and greatest fight The Yankee soldiers told of it to the last day of the
siege of Vlcksburg. When at last he was killed, his enemies stood around the
dead body and removed their hats In respect "Two dead and three wounded"
was the corporal's report. - - :
One morning last month a daily paper raked up the old case of defalcation.
In connection with many another historic affair, and closed by paying: "As far
as we can learn, the* police have never secured a clew to the defaulter's where-*
about*." Â¦
"Don't worry, my man," said the officer, as he laid a hand on the other's arm.
"I see your drift. You. don't want to think of me as standing blindfolded against
a wall to be shot at Well, that shall never happen. Leave me alone now and
wait for the morning." ' Vv :>v**
"Say. old man. we have been proud of you. You. have been a devil In battle.
You have made your mark and you have got to' die because of It We wish to
remember you as a fighter."
"I have no name, no home, no friends," replied the lieutenant, after a mo
ment. "There Is no one to whom I would send a message. -If any one thinks of
me it Is with contempt." .
"A mother?" softly queried the sergeant
"Yes, but no message." ,/'.
"A girlâ a sweetheart?" /
The lieutenant- shook his head, and the sergeant drew away a pace and sighed.
Presently he whispered: Â¦ â¢ .
"We have known you, and yet we have not known you well," continued the
sergeant. "You have a name; you have friends in the. States; you want to send
a last message to some one." . >.
"Only a matter of a couple of days," was the reply.
"He Is a fighterâ too much of a fighter. It must be his. desire to get killed.
He came to us because -he had done something: to disgrace his. name In the
States and he feels that he can never go back/; We do not' care to know what It
is. .If we had a thousand more like him we could capture Washington." â¢- Â£,
In the gray of the morning Ihe Man from New; York led a. handful
against the flank of the thousands at Vlcksburg to produce a diversion, and for
a time the thousand were thrown Into a panic/ .Then the rebel reneral's plans
went wrong and the enemy were allowediUo take heart and rally. -The regiment
swung about- and attacked with spirit. The last thirty soon became onlytwehty
flveâthen twentyâ then, ten.. Then the ten surrendered. The Man from New York
stormed and raved and He cursed 'them In one breath and -entreated
In another: but the ten had had enough fighting. \ -_--.
"So It Is you!" exclaimed the Yankee colonel.' : wherv. the leader of the ten had
bowed to the Inevitable. '"I would rather have captured, you than General Lee
himself. You shall have a capital military execution T have no doubt. As for
the others, let four be taken out and shot at once. We will decide the fate of
the others later on." . .
The five were Imprisoned for the rest of the day. and night -For a time, ths
Man from New York sat apart from the others and did not enter Into their hopes
and fears. Then a Yankee sergeantâ a Northerner who had lived In Boston for
years, but who had also been* fighting on the side of the "rebs" â crossed over to
him and said:
"They may spare us, as we are only small fry, but .your death Is certain." ""
That was the Introduction of the Man from New York. He gave no name
and no Information about himself. He simply said he was ready to fight for
the cause, and he was assigned to the ranks and , given arms. After the first
skirmish he was made a sergeant; after the second, a lieutenant. He was a
cool.' fearless ' fighter and an acquisition. No questions wÂ«s asked of him by
the rebels. He was one of a hundred "Northerners". who had found, their way to
the South to take a hand in the revolution. .Among, themselves,* however, they
said: . . - â¢ ' . .Â¦-_â¢Â¦Â¦â¢â¢;.Â¦ Â¦ â¢Â¦; . Â¦
A rebel sentry who paced the outer lines down near the water's edge one
morning soon after daylight came across a sight which startled him and raised
a hubbub loud enough to wake his eIq splnjf comrades among the trees. There
was a battered old skiff on the sands, and a few feet from It lay a, man asleep.
"HI. there! Wake up! Wake up!" said one of the half-dozen rebels who came
down and surrounded the sleeper and wondered who and what he was,
"Well?" asked the man, as he rubbed his eyes and sat up.
"Who are you?" . .â¢ .. -
"You can- call me the Man from New York." â¢Â¦ * ,. *
"How did you get here?" , ' . ' * .'
The man pointed to the old boat and rose to his feet to yawn and stretch.
|*What-do you want here?" continued the questioner. v.'i
"Take me to your commanding general. I guess he wants recruits, and
I am ready to Join." ' / -
T was by no means an unusual Item In the morning paper*.
It consisted of less than twenty lines and was to the effect
that the cashier and confidential man of B. & B., Broadway,
had been mlslng for two or three days, and that upon ex

hair. ' y*
"I won'tâ <]o you understand that? Stop
talking nonsense."
He thought there would be no end to the
sobs.
"Have It out,: dearâ there's plenty of
time."
Once she seemed to have stopped the
tears. He turned her face up to his own
again and softly kiÂ»sed her wet > eyes.
Her full lips were parted before him. but
he* did not kiss them. The Â«ob3 came
again.
"Thereâ there!â it will soon be over."
At last she ceased to cry from sheer
exhaustion, and when, with hjs hand un
der her chin, he forced up her head again,
she looked at him a full minute and then
closed her c;'es.
Ii? kissed their lids.
There came from time to time the in
voluntary quick little indrawlngs of
breathâ the aftermath of her weeping.
He held her so for a time, while neither
spoke. She had btcomo too weak to
struggle.
"My arms have starved for you so," lie
murmured. She gave no sign.
5 "Come over here." He led her, unresist
ing, around to the couch at the other side
of the table.
"Sit here, and we'll talk it over sensibly,
before you get ready." v
When he released her, she started
quickly up toward the door that led into
the hall.
"Don't do thatâ pleaso don't be foolish."
He locked the door and put the key In
his pocket. Then he went over to the
big folding doors and satisfied himself
they were locked from the other side. He
went back and Â£tood in front of her. She
had watched him with dumb terror in
her face. >
"Now we can talkâ but there isn't much
to be said. How soon can you be ready?"
"You are crazy!"
"Possiblyâ believe what you like."
"How did you ever dare? Oh, how
awful!"
"If you haven't passed that stage, I'll
hold you again."
"No, noâ please don'tâ please stand up
again. Sit over thereâ I can think bet
ter." '
"Think quickly. This is Saturday, and
to-morrow is their busy day. They may
not sit up late to-night." '
She arose with a little shrug of despera
tion that proclaimed her to be In the
power of a madman. She looked at her
face In the oval mirror, wiping her eyes
and making little passes and pats at her
disordered hair. He went over tp her.
'.'No, noâ please go over : there again.
Sit' down a f momentâ let me think. I'll
talk to, you presently."
. There was silence for five minutes. He
watched her, while she narrowed her
eyes in deep thought.
Then be looked at bis watch.
"I can give you an hour, If you'v* any
thing to say before It's done-^-not longer."
She drew a long breath. "
"Mr. Bines, are you mad? Can't you be
rational?" \
"Mr. Binesâ how absurd! Oh! let, me
go! You're hurting my wrist! Oh!â don t
âdon'tâ don't! Oh!" â¢
When he felt the slender wrist trying
to writhe from his grasp. he had closed
upon it more tightly,' and thrusting h!s
other arm quickly behind her, had drawn
her closely to him. Her cries and pload
ings were being smother<-d down on his
breast. Her struggles met only the un
bending, pitiless resistance of steel. ../
"Don't waste time, 1 tell youâ can't you
understand? Be sensibleâ talk if * you
mustâ only talk sense."
"Let me go at onceâ I demand itâ quick
âoh!"
"Take this hat off!"
He forced the wrist he had been holding
down between them, 60 thai she could not
free the hand, and, with his own hand
thus freed, he drew out the two long hat
pins and flung the hat with its storm
tossed cherries across the room. Still
holding her tightly, he put the free hand
on her brow and thrust her l head back,
so that she was forced to look up at him.
"Let me see you*-I want to see your
eyesâ they're my eyes now."
Her head strained against his hand to
be down again, and sfll her strength was
exerted to be away. She found she could
not move In any direction.
"Oh, you're hurting my neck. What
shall I do? I can't screamâ think what it
would mean!â you're hurting my neck!"
"Â¥ou are hurting your own neckâ stop
It!"
He kissed her face, softly, her checks,
her eyes, her chin.
"I've loved you so â don'tâ what's the
uie? Be sensible. My arms have starved
for you so â do you think they're going to
loosen now? Avice Milbreyâ Avice Mil
breyâAvice Milbrey I"
His arms tightened about her as he
said the name over and over.
"That's poetryâ It's all the poetry there
is in the world. It's a verse I say
over in the night. You can't understand
it yetâ it's too deep for you. It
means I must have youâ and the next
verse means that you must have meâ a
poor manâ be a poor man's wife â and all
the other versesâ millions of themâ mean
that I'll never give you upâ and there's a
lot more verses for you to write, when
you understand â meaning that you'll
never give me upâ and there's one In the
beginning means I'm going to carry you
out and marry you to-nightâ now, do you
understand?â right offâ this very nlghtl"
"Ob! Oh! this Is so terrible. Ob, it's so
awfull"
Her voice broke, and he felt her body
quiver with sobs. Her face was pitifully
convulsed, and tears, welled In her eyes.
"Let me goâ letâ meâ go!"
He released her head, but still held her
closely to him. Her sobs had become un
controllable.
"Hereâ " he reached for the little lace
edged handkerchief that lay beside her
long gloves and her purse on the table.
She took It mechanically. ;
"Pleaseâ oh. ' please let me goâ I beg
you." She managed it with difficulty be
tween the convulsions that were rending
her.
pure, raw force, needing, to be resistless,
only the guidance of a definite purpose.
Percjval walked out to Broadway, re
volving his plan. He saw it was but 6
o'clock. He could do nothing for at least
an hour. When he noted this he became
conscious of his hunger. He had eaten
nothing since morning. He turned into a
restaurant on Madison Square and ordered
dinner. When he had eaten, he sat with
his coffee for a final smoke of delibera
tion. He went over once more "the day's
arguments for and against the novel em
prise. He had become Insensible, how
ever, to all the dissenting ones. As a last
rally, he tried to picture the difficulties
he might encounter. He faced all he could
imagine.
"By God. I'll do it!"
"Oui, monsieur!" said the waiter, who
had been standing dreamily near, startled
into attention by the spoken words.
"That's allâ give me the check."
He was pent force waiting to be trans
lated into action. .
He drove first to the Milbrey house, on
the chance that she might be at home.
Jarviti answered his ring.
"Miss Mllbrev lb with Mrs. Van Geist.
sir." Jarvis spoke regretfully. He had
reasons of his own for believing that the
severance of the Milbrey relationÂ«hip with
Mr. Bines had been nothing short of ca
lamitous.
He rang Mrs. Van Gelst's bell, five min
utes later.
"The ladies haven't come back. sir. I
don't know where they might be. Per
haps at the Valners', In Fifty-second
street, sir."
He rang the Valners' bell. *Â»Â¦
"Mrs. Van Giest and Miss Milbrey? They
left here at least half an hour ago, sir."
"Go down the avenue slowly, driver!"
At Fortieth street he looked down to
the middle of the block.
Mrs. Van Geist. alone, was just alight
ing from her coupe.
He signaled the driver.
"Go to the other address again,, in Thir
ty-seventb street."
Jarvis opened the door.
"Yes, sirâ thank you, sirâ Miss Milbrey
1e in. sir. I'll see. sir."
Ho crossed the Rubicon of a door mat
and stood in. the unliRhted hall. At the
far end he caw light coming from a door
that he knew opened Into the library.
Jarvis came into the light. Behind him
appeared Miss Milbrey In the doorway.
"Miss Milbrey says will you enter the
library, Mr. Bines?"
CHAPTER XI*
He walked quickly back. At the ddor
way she save him her hand, which he
took In silence.
"Whyâ Mr. Bines!â you wouldn't have
surprised me last night. To-night I pic
tured you on your way West."
Her gown was of dull blue dimity. Bhe
still wore her hat. an arch of straw over
her face, with ripe red cherries nodding
upon it as she moved. He closed the door
behind him.
"Do come In. I've been having a soli
tary rummage among old things. It is my
last nlcht here. We're leaving for the
country to-morrow, you know." .
She stood by the table, the light from
a ehaded lamp making her color glow.
Now she noted that be had not spoken.
She turned quickly to him as If to ques
tion.
He took a swift little step toward her,
still without speaking. She stepped back
with a sudden Instinct of fright.
He took two quick steps forward and
grasped one of her wrists. He spoke In
cool, even tones, but the words came
fast:
"I've come to marry you to-night; to
take you away with me to that Western
country. You may not like the life. You
may grieve to death for all I know
but you're going. I won't plead, I won't
beg, but I am going to take you."
She had, begun to pull away In alarm
when he seized her wrist. His grasp did
not bruise; It did not seem to be tight;
but the hand that held It was Immovable.
"Mr. Bines, you forget yourself. Real
ly, this Isâ *V ;
"Don't waste time. You can say all
that needs to be saidâ I'll give you time
for that before we startâ but don't waste
the time saying all those useless things.
Don't waste time telling me I'm crazy.
Perhaps I am. We can settle that later.'.'
â¢T haven't been Irrational. I give you
my word, not once since I came here."
He looked at her steadily. All at once
he saw her face grow crimson. She
turned her eyes from bis with an effort.
"I'm going back to Montana in the
morning. I want you to marry me to
nightâ1 won't even wait one more day â
one more hour. I know it's a thing you
never dreamt ofâ marrying a poor man.
You'll look at it as the most disgraceful
act of folly you conld possibly commit,
and so will every one else hereâ but you'll
do it. To-morrow at this time you'll be
half way to Chicago with me."
"Mr. Binesâ I'm perfectly reasonable
and seriousâ I mean Itâ are you quite
sure yu'u didn't lose your wits when you
lost ytur money?"
"It may be a witless thing td marry a
girl who would marry for moneyâ but
neve,rj mind thatâ I'm used to taking
cliantfs." *
. She glanced at him, curiously.
"Yoii know I'm to marry Mr. Shepler
the tenth of n*xt month."
"Y<jur grammar Is faultyâ tense is
wrongâ You should Bay 'was to have mar
ried [Mr. Shepler.' I'm fastidious about
these little things, I confess."
"How can you jest?" â¢
"ilcan't. Don't think this is any joke.
He'll llnd out." " ;" ;
"Who v;ill find outâ what, pray?"
"He will. He's already said he was
afraid there might have been some non
sense between you and me, because we
talked that evening at the Oldakers*. He
told my grandfather he wasn't at all sure
of you until that day I lost my money."
"Oh. I seeâ and of course you'd like
your revengeâ carrying me off from him
just to hurt him."
"If you say that I'll hold you In my
arms again." He started toward her.
"I've loved you so, I tell youâ all the time
âall the time." .
"Or perhaps It's a brutal revenge on me,
â pfter thinking I'd only, marry for
morey."
"I've loved you always, I tell you."
He cann, up to her, more gently now,
and took up her band to kiss it. He saw
the rirg.
"Take his ring off!"
She looked up at him with ah amused
little smile, but did not move. He reached
for the hand, and she put It behind her.
"Take it off." he said, harshly.
He forced hex hand out, Â¦ took off the
ring with Its gleaming stone, none too
gently.' and laid it on the table behind
him. Then he covered the hand with
kisses. | :.;;:/
"Now It's my hand. Perhaps there was
a little, of both those feelings you accuse
me ofâ perhaps I did want to triumph
over both you and Sheplerâ and the other
people i who said you'fl never, marry for
anything but moneyâ but do you think I'd
have had either one of those desires If. I
hadn't loved you? Do you think I'd have
cared how many Sbeplers you married if
I hadn't loved you so, night â¢ and dayâ
always turning to you In spite of every
thingâloving you always, under evcry
thlng-always. I tell you."
"Under whatâ what 'everything'?"
"When I was sure you had no heart
that you couldn't care for any man ex
cept a' rich manâ that you would marry
only for money."
"You ! thought that?" ,
"Of course I thought it." 1 ' ' '
"Whit has changed you?" Â«
"Nothing. I'm going to change it now
by proving differently. I shall take you
against your willâ but I shall make you
love meâ in the end. I know youâ you're
a woman, In spite of yourself I" -
"You were entirely right about me. I
would. even have married you because of

"Tell me what It la you're holding' back

her eyes fixed ahead. At length she
stirred herself to speak.

marriage. I wanted what that would
bring, too. I was torn between the desires
-or rather the natural Instincts and the
trained desires. I had Ideals about loving
and being loved, and I had the mate rial
Ideals of my experience In this world out
here.
"I was untrue to each by turns. Here
âI want to show you something."
She took up a book with closely written
pages.
"I came here to-nightâ I won't conceal
from you that I thought of you when I
came. It was my last time here, and you
fcad gone. I supposed. Among other things
I had out this old diary to burn, and I
found this, written on my eighteenth
birthday, when I came outâ the fond, ro
mantic, secret ideal of a foolish girl
listen:
" The Soul of Love wed the Soul of
Truth and their daughter, Joy, was born:
who was immortal and In whom they
lived forever!'
"You seeâ that was the sort of moon
shine I started In to live. Two or three
times I was a grievous disappointment to
my people, and once or twice, perhaps.
I was disappointed myself. I was never
quite sure what I wanted. But if you
think I was consistently mercenary, you
are mistaken.
"I shall tell you something moreâ
something no one knows. There was a
man I met while that ideal was still
strong and beautiful to me â but after I'd
come to see that here. In this life. It was
not easily to be kept. He was older than
I, experienced with womenâ a lover of
women, I came to understand In time. I
was a novelty to him, a fresh recreation;
he enjoyed all those romantic Ideals of
mine. I thought then he loved me. and I
worshiped him. He was married, but
constantly said he was about to leave his
wife so she would divorce him. I prom
ised to come to him when It was done.
He married for money and he would
have .been poor again. I didn't mind In
the least. I tell you this to show you that
I could have loved a poor man, not only
well enough to marry him, but to break
with the traditions and brave the scan
dal of going' to him In that common way.
With all I felt for him r ( should have been
more than satisfied. But I came In time
to see that he was not as earnest as I
had been. He wasn't capable of feeling
what I felt. He was more cowardly than
I â or rather, I was more reckless than he.
I suspected it a long time; I became con
vinced of it a year ago and a little over.
He became hateful to me. I had wasted
my love. Then he became funny. Butâ
you seeâ I amanot altogether what you
believed me. Walt a bit longer, please.
"Then I gave up, almostâ and later, I
gave up entirely. And when my brother
was about to marry that woman, and
Mr. Shepler asked me to marry him. I
consented. It seemed an easy way to end
It all. I'd quit fondling Ideals. And you
had told me I must do anything I could
to keep Fred from marrying that woman.
My people came to say the same thingâ
and so â "
"If he had married hexâ If they were
married nowâ then you would feel tree to
marry met"
"You would still be the absurdest man
in New Yorkâ but we can't discuss that.
He isn't going to marry her."
"But he has married herâ"
"What do you meant"
"I supposed you knewâ Oldaker told me
as I left the hotel. He and your father
were witnesses. The marriage took place
this afternoon at the Arllngham."
"You're not deceiving me?"
"Come, come!â girl!"
"Oh, pardon me. pleaae! Of course. I
didn't mean itâ but you stunned ma. And
papa said nothing to me about It before
he left. The money must have been too
great a temptation to him and to Fred.
She has Just made some enormous amount
In copper stock or something."
"I know, she had better advice than I
had. I'd like to reward the man who
gave It to her."
"And I was sure you were going to mar
ry that other woman."
"How could you think so?"
' "Of course, I'm not the least bit Jealous
âit isn't my dispositionâ but I did think
Florence Akemit wasn't the woman to
make you happy. Of course, I liked her
Immenselyâ and there were report* golns
about â everybody seemed so sure â and you
were with her so much. Oh, how I did
hate her!"
"I tell you she Is a Joke and always
was."
"It's funnyâ that's exactly what I told
Aunt Cornelia about thatâthat man."
"Let's stop joking, then."
"How absurd you areâ with my plans all
made and the day set "
- There was & knock at the door. He
went over and unlocked it. Jarvis was
there.
"Mr. Shepler, Miss Avlce."
They looked at each other.
"Jarvis, shut that door and wait out
side."
"Yes, Mr. Bines."
"You can't see him."
"But I mustâ we're engaged, don't you
understand?â of course, I must!"
"I tell you I won't let you. Can't you
understand that I'm not talking Idly?"
She tried to evade him and reach thÂ«
door, but she was caught again In his
armsâ held close to him.
"If you like he shall come In now. But

me, as he did In that Jeweler's the other
nightâ and you can't see him at all ex
cept as you are now." Â«Â»
She struggled to be free.
"Oh. you're so brutall" -
"I haven't begun yetââ" .
He drew her toward the door.
"Oh, not that â don't open Itâ m tell
himâ yes. I will!"
"I'm taking no more chances, and the
time is short."
Still holding her closely with one ana
he opened the door. The man stared im
passively above their headsâ a graven
Image of unconsciousness.
"Jarvis."
"Yes, sir."
"Miss Milbrey wishes you to say to Mr.
Bhepler that she is engaged "
"That I'm 111," she Interrupted, still
making little struggles to twist from hla
grasp, her head still bent down.
"That she is engaged with Mr. Bines.
Jarvis, and can't see him. Say It that
wayâ 'Miss Milbrey Is engagefl with Mr.
Bines and can't see you.'"
"Yes, sir!"
He remained standing: motionless, as ha
had been, his eyes still fixed above him.
But the eyes of Jarvts, from long train
ing, did not require to be bent upon those
things they needed to observe. They saw
something now that was at least two feet
below their range.
The girl made a little move with her
right arm. which was Imprisoned fast
between them, and which some Intuition
led her captor not to restrain. The firm,
little hand worked its way slowly cp,
went creepingly over his shoulder and
bent tightly about his neck.
"Yes, sir," repeated Jarvis, without the
quiver of an eyelid, and went.
He closed the door with his free band.
CHAPTER XXXVIIL
BOME PHENOMENA PECULIAR TO
SPRING.
Â»Â¦* -# E awoke early, refreshed and in-
I \ tensely alive. With the work done
Pâ 1 he became conscious of a feelir.f
X. I of disaesodatlon from the sur-
J roundings In which he ha*
to long been at home. Many words of
the talkative German were running in
his mind from the night before. He was
glad the business was off his mind. HÂ«
would now go the pleasant journey, and
think on the way.
His trunks were ready for the car; and
before he went down stairs his hand-bag
was packed end the preparations for the
start completed.
He tried to recall some forgotten detail
of the business that might serve to oc
cupy him. But the lintshlng had been
thorough.
Then all at once, a new-born world
cohered out of the nebula, and the sight
of Us measured, orderly whirling dazed
him. He had been seized with a wish
almost an intention, so stunning in its
audacity that he all but reeled un
der the shock. It seemed to him that
the thing must have been germinated
in his mind without hla knowledge; it
had lain there, gathering force while he
rested, now to burst forth and dazzle him
with its shine. All that undlmmed fresh
ness of longing he had felt the day be
fore â all the unnamed, unidentified, name
less desiresâ had flooded back upon him,
but now no longer aimless. They were
acutely definite. He wanted Avlce Mll
breyâwanted her with an intensity as un
reasoning as it was resistless. This was
the new world he had watched
out of the chaos in his mind, 'taking its
allotted orbit in a planetary system of
rotsilile. rational, matter-of-course pro
ceedings.
And Avice Milbrey was to marry Shep
ler, the triumphant money king.
Then there tame upon him to reinforce
this want a burning sense of defeat. He
remembered Uncle, Peter's first warnings
In the mine about "cupboard love"; the
gossip of Hipbee: "If you were broke
ehe'd have about as much use for you- â ''
ell the talk he had listened to so long
about marriage for money; and, at the
last, Shepler's words to Uncle Peter: "I
was uncertain until copper went to 51."'
Those were three wise old men who had
talked, men who knew something of wom
en and much of the world. And they
were so Irritating In their certainty. What
a fine play to fool them all!
The sense of defeat burned into him
more deeply. He had been vanquished,
cheated, Fcornc-d, shamefully flouted. The
money was goneâ all of Uncle Peter's
complaints and biting sarcasms came
back to him with renewed bitterness; but
his revenge on Uncle Peter would be in
showing him a big man at work, with no
nonsense about him. But Shepler, who
was now certain, and Higbee, who had
always been certainâ especially Shepler,
with his easy sense of superiority with a
woman over any poor man. That was a
different matter. There was a thing to
think about. And he wanted Avice Mil
brey. He could not, he decided, go back
without her.
Something of the old lawless spirit of
adventure that had spurred on his reck
less forbears urged him to carry the girl
back with him. She didn't love him. He
would take her In spite of that; over
power her; force her to go. It was a re
venge of superb audacity. Shepler had
not* been sure of her until now. Well.
Shepler might be hurled from that cer
tainty by one hour of determined action.
The great wild wish narrowed itself into
a definite plan. He recalled the story
Uncle Peter had told at the Oldakers*
about the woman and her hair. A woman
could be coerced if a man knew her weak
ness. He could coerce her. He knew it
Instinctively; and the instinctive belief
rkllied to its support a thousand little
looks from her. little Intonations of her
voice, little turnings of her head when
they had been together. In spite of her
calculations. In spite of her love of money,
he could make her feel her weakness. He
was a man with the power.
It was heady wine for the morning. He
described himself briefly as a lunatic and
walked on again. But the crazy notion
would not be gone. The day before he
had been passive. Now he was active,
acutely aware of himself and all bis
wants. He walked a mile trying to dis
miss thÂ« idea. He cat down again, and It
flooded back upon him with new force.
Her people were gone. Ehe had even Inti
mated a wish to talk with him again. It
could be done quickly. He knew. He felt
the primitive superiority of man's mere
brute force over woman. He gloried in
his knotted muscles and the crushing
power of his desires.
Afterward, she would reproach him bit
terly. They would both be unhappy. It
was no matter. It was the present, the
time when he should be living. He would
have her. and Sheplerâ Shepler might
have had the One Girl mine â but this girJ,
never!
Again he tried faithfully to walk off the
obsession. Again were his essays at sober
reason unavailing.
His mind was Bet as It had been when
he bought the stocks day after day
against the advice of the best judges In
the street. He could not turn himself
back. There must be success. There
could not be a giving: upâ and there must
not be a failure.
Hour after hour he alternately walked
and rested, combating and favoring the
mad project. It was a foolish little world
and people were always waiting for an
other time to begin the living of life. The
German had quoted Martial: "To-mor
row I will live, the fool says; to-day lt
eeirs too late. ThÂ« wise lived yesterday."
If he did not go away alone he knew
he would always regret It. If he carried
her triumphantly off, doubtless his re
gret for that would eventually be as
great. The first regret was certain. The
latter was equally plausible; but. If It
came, would it not be preferable to the
other? To have held her onceâ to have
taken her away, to have triumphed over
her own calculations, and, best of all. to
have triumphed over the money-king rest-
Ing fatuously confident behind his -wealti,
dignifying no man as rival who was not
rich. The present, so, was more than
any possible future, how dire soever It
might be.
He was mad to prove to heiv-and to
Shepler â that she was more a woman
than either had supposedâ a /Woman In
tpite of herself, weak, unreasoning; to
prove to them both that a determined
man has a vital power to coerce which
no money may ever equal.
Not until 5 o'clock had he by turns
urged and fought himself to the ferry.
By that time hs had given up arguing.
He was dwelling entirely upon his plan
of action. Strive and grope as he would,
the thing had driven him on relentlessly.
His reason could not take him beyond the
reach of Its goad. Par as ho went he
loved her even farther. She belonged to
him. He would have her. He seemed to
have been storing, the day before a vast
quantity of energy that he was now draw
ing lavishly upon. For the time, he was
THE SUKDAY CALL.

"But sbÂ« eloDed with her true love,
young AnnekJe Van Schoule; left the
horns on Hickory street one night, and
went far away, away up beyond One
Hundred and Twenty-fifth street some
where, and then wrote them about It"
"And left the sampler?"
"She had ner husbandâ she didn't need
any old sampler after thatâ Le marlage
porte consell, aussl, monsieur. And now,
you've married your wife with her wed
ding ring that came from Holland years
and years ago."
It was alter midnight when they began
to pack. When they finished it was near
ly four.
She had laid out a -~rk dress for the
Journey, but be Insisted that she put It
in a suit case and wear the one she had
on.
"I shouldn't know you in any otherâ
and it's the color of your eyes. I want
that color all over tne place."
"But ws shall be traveling:."
"In our own car. That car has been
described in the publlo prints as a 'suite
of palatial apartments with all modern
conveniences.' "
"I forgot."
"We shall be going West like the old
'49-ers, seeking adventure and' gold."
"Did they go tn their private cars?"
THE NEW ARGON AUT8.
Mrs. Van Gelst came fluttering out to
the carriage.
"You and Briggs may get out here. Jar
vis. There, that's for you", and that's for
Briggsâ and thank you both very much."
."Child, child! What does it mean?"
"Mr. Bines Is my husband, Mutterchen,
and we're leaving for the West In the
morning."
The excitement did not abate for ten
minutes or so.
"And do say something cheerful, dear,"
pleaded Avlce at parting. \
"You mad childâ I was always afraid
you might do something like this. , But-
I will say I'm not altogether sure you've
acted foolishly."
"Thank you. you dear old Mutterchen,
and you'll come to see usâ you shall see
how happy I can be with thisâ this boyâ
this Lochinvar Jr. I'm sure Mrs. Lochin
var always lived happily ever after."
Mrs. Van Geist kissed them both.
"Back to Thirty-seventh street, driver."
"I shall want you at seven-thirty sharp
to-morrow morning," he said, as they
alighted. "Will you be here, sure?"
"Sure, boss!"
"You'll make another one of those If
you're on time."
The driver faced the bill toward the
nearest street light and scanned it. Then
he placed it tenderly In the lining of his
hat, and said, fervently:
"I'll be here, gent!"
"My trunks," Avlce reminded him.
"And, driver, send an express wagon
at seven sharp. Do you understand, now?"
"Sure, gent: I'll have It here at seven,
and be here at seven-thirty."
They went in.
"You've sent Briggs off, and I've all
that packing and unpacking to do."
"You have a husband who is handy at
those things."
They went up to her room where two
trunks yawned open.
Under her directions and with her help
he took out the light summer things and
replaced them wkh heavier gowns, stout
shoes, golf capes and. caps.
"We'll be up on the Bitter Root ranch
this summer, and . you'll need heavy
things." he had told her.
Sometimes he packed clumsily, and she
was obliged to do his work over. In
these intervals he studied with interest
tho big Oiu room and her quaint old sam
pler worked in colored worsteds that had
faded to grays and uull browns: "La
Nuit Porte Cornell."
"Grandma Loekermann did it at the
convent, ages ago." she told him.
"What a cautious young thing she must
have been!" â¢
She leaned against bis shoulder.
CHAPTER XL.I.
"Tra trusting so much to you, and
you're trusting so much to me. It's such
a rash step!"
"Must I "
"No, I'm colng. Couldn't Â»we stop and
take Aunt Cornelia?"
"Aunt Cornelia won't have a chance to
worry about this until it's all over. We'll
stop there, then, if you like."
"We'll try Dr. Prendle, then. He's al
most sure, to be In."
"It won't make any difference if he
Isn't. We'll find one. Those horses are
rested. They can go all night If they
must."
. "I have Grandmother Loekermann's
wedding ringâ of course you didn't fetch
one. Trust a man to forget anything of
Importance."
His grasp of her hand during the ride
did not relax.
It was nearly seven. Outside the sky
"Some of them went in rolling: six
horse Concords and some walked, and
some of them pushed their baggage across
In little handcarts, but they had fun at
Itâ ajid wÂ« snail have to work as hard
when we ret there."
"Dear me! And I'm so tired already. I
feel quite done up."
8he threw herself on the wide divan,
and he fixed pillows under her head.
"You boy! I'm glad it's all over. LÂ«fi
rest a moment.?
/ He leaned back by her and drew her
head on his arm.
"I'm glad,.' too. It's the hardest day's
work I ever did. Are you comfortable?
Rest."
"It's so good," she murmured, nestling
on his shoulder. /
"Uncle Peter took his honeymoon in a
big wagon drawn by a mule team, two
hundred miles over the Placerville and
Red Dog Trailâ over tne mountains from
California to Nevada. But ha says ho
never had so happy a time." â¢
"He's an old dear! I'll kiss himâ how
Is It you sayâ 'good and plenty?' Did
our Uncle Peter elope, too?"
He chuckled.
"Not exactly. It wai more like abduc
tion complicated with assault and battery.
Uncle Peter Is pretty direct In his meth
ods. The young lady's family thought
she could do better with a bloated capi
talist who owned three-eighths of a saw
mill. But Uncle Peter and she thought
she couldn't. So Uncle Peter had to lick
her father and two brothers beforo he
could get her ' away. Ho would have
licked the purse-proud rival, too. but the
rival ran Into the sawmill he owned
three-eighths of and barricaded the
whole eight-eighths-^-the five-eighths that
didn't belong to him at all, you under
stand â and then he threatened through a
chink to shoot somebody if Uncle Peter
didn't go oft about his business. So Un
cle Peter went, not wanting any unneces
sary trouble, j I've always suspected he
was a pretty ready scrapper In those days,
but the poor old fellow's getting a bit
childish now, with all this trouble about
losing the money, and the hard time he
had in the snow last winter. By the way.
I forgot to 'ask, and it's almost too lata
now, but do you like cats?" .
"I adore themâ aren't kittens the dear
est?"
"Wellâ you're healthyâ and your nose
doesn't really fall below the speci
fications, though it doesn't promise that
you're any too sensibleâ but If you can
make up for It by your Infatuation for
cats, perhaps it will be all right. Of
course I couldn't keep you, you know, if
you weren't very fond of cats, because
Uncle Peter'd raise a row "
She was quite still and he noted from
the change in her soft breathing that she
slept. "With his free hand ho carefully
shook out a folded steamer rug and drew
It over her.
For an hour he watched her, feeling the
arm on which she lay growing numb. He
reviewed the' day and me crowded night.
He could do something after all. Among
other things, now, he would drop a.lit
tle note to Hlgbee and add the news of
his marriage as a postscript. She was ac
tually hjs wife. How quickly It had come.
His heart was full of a great love for
her, but he could not quite repress the
pride in his achievementâ and Shepler
had not been sure until he was poor I
He lost consciousness himself for a lit
tle while.
When he awoke the cold light of the
morning was stealing In. He was pain
fully cramped and chilled from the open
window. From outside came tho loud
chattering of sparrows and far away he
could hear wagons as they rattled across
a street of Belgian blocks from asphalt
to asphalt The light had been late In
coming and ha could see a sullen gray
sky, full of darker clouds.
Above the chiffonier he could sea the
ancient sampler.
"La Nuit Porto Consell.** It was true.
In the cold, pitiless light of tha morn
ing a sudden sickness of doubting seized
him. I She would awaka and reproach him
bitterly for coercing her. Sha had been
right, tha night before,â It was madness.
They had talked afterward so feverishly,
as if to forget their situation. Now sha
would face it coldly after the sleep.
"La Nuit Porto Consell." Had ho not
been a fool? And ha loved her so. Ha
would hava her anywayâ no matter what
she said, now.
She stirred and her wide-open eyas were
staring up at himâ staring with hurt,
troubled wonder. - Tba Â»T"Â»**Tn*Pt In
them grewâ she could not understand.
He stopped breathing. His embrace of
he relaxed.
And then ha saw remembranceârecogni
tionâwelcomeâand there blazed Into her
eyes such a look of whole love as makes
men thrill to all goodâ such a look as
makes them know they are men and dare
all great deeds to show it. Like a sun
rise,. It flooded her face with dear, won
drous beautiesâ and still she looked, si
lent.* motionlessâ In an ecstasy of pure
realization. Then her arms closed about
his neck with a swift little rushing and
heâ still half-doubting, still curiousâ felt
himself strained to her. Still more close
ly sha clung, putting out with her inten
sity all his misgiving.
She sought his lips with her ownâ eager,
pressing.
"Kiss meâ kiss meâ kiss me! Oh, it's
all trueâ all true! My best-loved dream
has come all true! I have rested so In
your arms. I never knew rest before. I
can't remember when I haven't awakened
to doubt, and worry, and heart-sickness.
And now it's peaceâ dear, dear, dearest
dear, for ever and ever and ever."
They sat up. .
"Now we shall goâ get me away quick
ly." " ...
"I must . buy you one of thosa nice,
shiny black ear-trumpets at the first stop.
You can't have been hearing; at all well.
. . . See, sweetheart,â out across the
river. That's where our bl* West is, over
that .wayâ isn't it fresh and green and
beautiful?â and how fast you're going to
itâ you and your husband. I believe it's
going to be a good game . . . for us
both . . . my love. . ."
She arose and would have gone around
the . table to him, bat he met her with
open arms. \ â¢
"Oh, you boy P you do love me,â you
do!"
"Well, Z admit I foozled my approach
on that copper stockâ but X won youâ
really my winnings In Wall Street are
pretty dazzling after all, for a man who
didn't know tne ropesâ there's a mirror
directly back of you, Mrs. Bines, If you
wish to look at themâ with a pink rose
over that klssy place Just at their tem
ple."
She turned and looked, pretending to be
quite unimpressed.
"I always was capable of It, I tall you,
âboy I"
"What hurt me worst that night. It
showed you could love some oneâ you did
have a heartâ but you couldn't love me."
She did not seem to hear at first, nor
to comprehend when she went back over
his words. Then she stared at hln* in
sudden amazement
He saw his blunder and looked foolish.
"I seeâ thank, you for saying what you
did last nightâ end you didn't mindâ you
came to me anyway, in spite of that."
"I ordered the sun turned on at Just
this point." replied her husband, with a
large air. "I wanted you to see- the last
of that town under a cloud, so you might
not be homesick so soon."
"You don't know me. You don't know
what a good wife I shall be."
"But I had to make you. I had to pick
you up fust as I did that first time, and
again down in the mineâ and you were
frightened because you knew this time I
wouldn't let you go."
"Only half afraid you wouldn'tâ the
other half I was afraid you would. They
got all mixed upâ I don't know which was
worse."
They had finished their breakfast. One
half of the pink roses were on tho table,
and one from the other half was In her
hair.
"P. S. I should have preferred to wait
and acauaint you with my change of in
tention before marrying, but my hus
band's plans were made and ha would
not let me delay.'* -
He sealed the envelope, placed- it secure
ly under the cord that bound the package,
and their driver delivered it to the man
who opened Shepler's door.
As their train emerged from the cut at
Spuyten Duyvil and sped to the north
along the Hudson, the sun blazed forth.
"There, boyâ I knew the sun must shins
to-day."
"Dear Rulon Shepler: I am sure- you
know women too well to have thought
I loved you as a wife should love her hus
band. And I know your bigness too well
to believe you will feel harshly toward me
for deciding that I could not marry you.
I could of course consistently attribute
my change to consideration for you. I
should have been very little comfort to
you. If I should tell you Just the course
I have mapped out for myselfâ Just what
latitude I propose to claimâ I am certain
you would agree with me that I have
done to you an inestimable favor.
"Yet I have not changed because I
do not love you, but because I do love
some one else with all my heart: so that
I claim no credit except for an entirely
consistent selfishness. But do try to
believe, at the same time, that my own
selfishness has been a kindness to you.
I send you a package with this hasty
letter, and beg you to believe that I shall
remainâ and am now for the first timeâ
Sincerely yours,
"A VICE MTXBREY BINES."
"There's one errand to do." she said,
as they entered the carriage, "but it's
on our way. Have him go up Madison
avenue and deliver this."
She showed him the package addressed:
"Mr. Rulon Shepler. personal."
"And this," she said, giving him an un
sealed note. "Bead It, please !"
He read r
"Coming!"
She took uo a little package she had
brought with her and went out to meet
him. ' *
was still all gloom.
In the rush of her reassurance he had
forgotten bis arm. It hung llmo from
his shoulder.
"It was cramped."
"And you didn't move it?"
They beat it and kneaded it raylv to
gether, until the fingers were full of the
rushing blood and able again to close
warmly over her own little hand. '
"Now go, and let me get ready. I won't
be long."
He went below to the library, and In
thÂ« dim gray light picked up a book.
"The Delights of Delicate Eatiner." He
tried another. "101 Sandwiches."' The
next was "Famous Epicures of the Sev
enteenth Century." On the floor was her
diary. He placed It on the table. He
heard her call him from the stairs:
"Bring me up that ring from the table,
please!" ".'','
He went ud and handed it to her
through the narrowly opened door.
As hÂ« went down the staira he heard
the bell ring somewhere below, and ho
went to the door.
"Baggage!"
The two trunks were down and out.
"They're to go jon this car. attached to
Â¦the Chicago express." He wrote the di
rections on one of his cards and paid the ,
man.
At seven-thirty the bell rang again. The I
cabman was there.
"Seven- thirty. gentH*
"A vice!"
"I'm coming. And there are two bags

let her pass him and went up for them.
She went Into the library and, taking
up the dlarv, tore out a sheet, marked
heavily upon It with a pencil around the
passsge she had read the evening before
and sealed it in an envelope. She ad
dressed it to her father, and laid it. with
a paper-weight on it, upon "The Delights
of Delicate Eating," where he would be
sure to find It.
The book itself she placed on the wood
laid ready in the grate to light, touched
a match to the crumpled paper under
neath and put up the blower. She stood
waiting to see that the fire would burn.
Over the mantel from its yellow canvas
looked above her head the humorously
benignant eyes of old AnnekJÂ© Van
Schoule, who had once removed from
Maspe.th Kill on Long Island to New
Harlem on the Island of Manhattan, and
carried there, against her father's will,
the yellow haired girl he had loved. His
face now seemed to be pretending un

he had witnessedâ lest, if he betrayed his
consciousness he should be forced, in
spite of himself, to disclose his approval

"A vice!"
He stood in the hallway waiting for her.
It was a auarter past ten. In another
moment sbo rustled softly down to him.

She gave a low, delicious little laugh.
She reached both arms up around him,
pulleu down his head and kissed him.

Â£jj MAIL ORDERS SOLICITED. KiSALOMONâ The Mighty Conquerors
These three menâ Llncol n, Garfield and McKin
leyâwere peculiarly the type and character of men
that, even from an assassin's point of view, did
not justify assassination. Each had advanced from
the ranks of toil by the suffrages of his country
men. Each, In his own way. but in an unusual
degree, was kind, considerate, gentle and for
giving. It Js true that during the administra
tion of Abraham Lincoln the country was engaged
in one of the most fearful and lamentable wars
that ever'afflicttd anv people. But what could
have better illustrated the man, his real spirit and
love of peace than the closing words of his In
augural address:
"In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-country
men, and not in mine, is the momentous Issue of
civil war. The Government will not assail you;
you can have no conflict without being your
selves the aggressors. You have no oath regis
tered In heaven to destroy the government; while
I shall nave the most solemn one to -preserve, protect and defend it.' .
If this people and this nation had existed only to give birth to Abraham
Lincoln, each would have Justified its existence. So long as history shall en
dure he will etand as an unanswerable contradiction to all who claim or as
sume that rank or station, opportunities, or even special preparation are essen
tial to the-greatest usefulness and success in a position of the greatest possible
responsibility and honor. No civilized man ever came into the world in greater
loneliness or poverty. He was born uPon the border and grew up along tno
ragged edges of civilization. Without e'-hools or churches, except of the poorest
and rudest, wholly without the supposed broadening influences of travel, know-
Ing only the advantages of that university of the outside world, that col lege
common to all of the American people, he showed himself the equal In skill,
patience endurance and true statesmanship of any man of any age or country.
When others, whose radical and sectional course had brought the country to
the verge of war and separation, recoiled In alarm from the responsibility of
the danger they had created he alone of all the leaders never faltered. In all
that pertained to the bonds of- affection that should have united his distracted
countrymen. In the memories *of the past, in the common interest of all. In
everything that tended toward peace and to avert war. he was vine and flower.
But in the performance of his duty as he saw it. in his adherence to his offi
cial oath. In the preservation of the Union as he found It, he was rock and oak.
In simplicity. In high character, in the possession of that characteristic we
call humanity or human nature he was the greatest character of all history.
Maay of the creat .orations of the world have been preserved. Two of these
are each, many times over, shorter than the others. Both of these were produc
tions cf Uncolnâ his second Inaugural and his Gettysburg address.â From Nota
ble Speeches by Notable Speakers of the Greater West, published by the Whlta
ker & Ray Company.
MYERSâ The Greater Grand Army
HE coming: National Encampment of the Grand
Army, of the Republic promises to bo an event of
much greater magnitude than that held In this city
In 1SSS. and owing to the fact that it will undoubt
edly be the last of Its kind held on this coaat will
possess an unusual Interest to many thousands.
From 'the shores of the 'Atlantic, from the North
ern Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, from almost every
city, town and hamlet of that great domain lying
east of the Rscklea. will come the grim, grizzled
and white-haired old veterans who fought during
the eventful period of the Civil War, now ended
nearly forty years ago. T^ese will present an ob
ject lesson of patriotism to the young and growing
generation, .who will see in the bent and broken
forms those who stood together In the shock of
battle for the preservation of a Union handed down
to them as a priceless heritage by their forefathers
of a century and a quarter ago; will see the ones
wh* foughtâ Americans against Americana, fathers
against eons and brothers against brothers; fought those whose mistaken belief ir,
State right doctrine influenced. them to seek for the destruction of the Union,
which has now become as dear to those valiant men who wore the gray as to thÂ«
S&V.ant defenders of Old Glory, who wore the blue.
Many empty sleeves and artificial limbs will this coming week bear silent testi-
m Â°>?? *?v t.u ero , l * m Â°/ " lo Â» e who stood Â»n the front ranks of battle ready to diÂ«
and to the liberality of California' and the citizens of San Francisco they will owe
an obligation, for it permits the veterans an opportunity to again re-establish theij
bivouacs. May the glow of their campflres this week light up with Joy the face
of those gallant soldiers and sailors of the Civil War whose Imperishable deedi

CHIPMANâ The Sacred Brotherhood
I do not think it is overstating the fact when I de
clare that the sentiment of comradeship among the
Jnion veterans of the Civil War is stronger than
my other bond of friendship known to the social
relations of men; and among the numerous fra
ternal organizations in this country I know of
aone where so sacred a feeling of brotherhood
sxists as in the Grand Army of the Republic. I
never meet a man wearing the bronze Grand Army
button without experiencing an instinctive desire
to exchange salutations with him. That little tal
isman awakens in my mind unconsciously a flood
Df memories the most precious in my life, and
Â¦peaks to me of the most important epoch in our
nation's history. That little," modest, unostenta
tious insignia, worn by our comrades as a> badge
of membership, has a significance far more hon
orable than any decoration or symbol worn by the
members of any fraternal society to which men
may attach themselves. '
My frlenda, it Is dllllcult to realize how rapidly the survivors of the Civil
War are passing away from these earthly scenes: It Is easy to fix the day, not
far distant, when the last remaining veteran of the Union army will have been
called to Join his comrades In the realms of eternal life. The muster roll of
the Grand Army In the year 1890 showed a membership of 400,489. The roll at the
close of the year 1900 showed 276.662. In a decade 123.S27 had ceased to answer
roll call. Thirty per cent of our number died in a brief ten years.
There is something mournfully pathetic in the thought that a splendid or
ganization like thei Grand Army of the Republic, with such an illustrious his
tory, should have so brief an existence; that post after post must .surrender its
charter: that department after department. must close Its headquarters; that the
occasion for a national encampment must soon pass away, and that members
of-the Grand Army will be found only in small groups scattered over this broad
land, until finally the nation will search out the small remaining bandâ the last
remnant of that Grand Army that saved the Unionâ and will honor them as
never men have been honored, and will tenderly guard them until the Great
Reaper shall have summoned them to Join their comrades "in that undiscovered
country, from whose bourne no traveler returns."
BOOTHâ The Voice of Freedom
The place where we had assembled is eloquent
with the voice of â¢ freedom. Liberty is nature's
gospel, and the mountains are among the grandest
of its teachers. Mountains were consecrated by
the presence of God when he rÂ§y*aled*hlrnself to
Moses upon Sinai; they were baptized with Nthe
blood of our Savior when he died upon Calvary.
They are associated with the grandest passages
of history. In their rocky fastnesses freedom has
ever taken refuge In her weakness until she coull
grow strong enough to battle for her rights upon
the plains. To-day, before these great altars na
ture has built to liberty, in this favored region
that has never known the presence of a king
or footprint of a slave, we have'gathered together,
without -one pulse, of, trembling: for our country's
fate . without one thrill of fear for its destiny,
with no foreboding of eventual danger from lurk-
In* lightnings In gathering clouds; we are here
to ; cslebr ate a nation's birthday, not . to contem-
We are still laylnr bare the colden treasures of the mountains, and develop
ing the agricultural riches of the plain a. but our hearts are 111 at ease. Again
our brethren are in the field. , K very breeze that sweeps from the East brings
to our ears the clash, of resounding arms." Armies are mustering, such as the
continent has never, known before, not now to repel foreign Invasion, nor carry
the terrors of the republio into unfriendly lands, but sons of the sires who
fought at Bunker Hill anu Yorktown, at Moultrte and Saratoga, - have met In
deadly. conflict over the torn and bloody garment* of the nation's- glory, around
the tombof Washington.â From "Notable * Speeches by Notable Speakers i of - the
The annual encampments of the Grand Army
of the Republic are of course of greater Interest to
the members of the organization than to others.
This Interest depends somewhat upon the locality
where the encampment Is held. The only gather
ing of this kind ever held on the Pacific Coast
was the Twentieth National Encampment held In
this city In August, 1S8Â«. California generally and
Ban Francisco particularly established at that time
a reputation for such magnificent and lavish hos
pitality that at every succeeding encampment It
was talked of as thÂ© grandest and most memor
able gathering In the history of the order. When.
therefore, at the encampment of Washington last
September San Francisco offered to entertain thÂ»
veterans every competitor for this honor dropped
out of the field, and our city by the Golden Gat*
was almost unanimously chosen.

it rebel bayonets that' threatened to sweep our

I look Into the faces of men to-night who, ta

enemies and* have planted Its flag on rebel ram
parts. V

Can It be possible that, while the survivors of this great struggle are itfll
with us, while they walk our streets, a generation has , come on forgetful of
their great achievements? Has the moth *of ' avarice, the canker of greed, to
eaten Into the hearts of this generation that they are unmindful of these men?
God forbid! -
Th6 American soldier of the civil war has not been commercially greedy.
He was not. tempted to service by his monthly stipend.
If there had been no other Impulse than eleven or thirteen dollars & month
we should have bad no army. â¢ The men who went to the front were not Im
pelled by sordid purposes or hope of gain. And when the war was over their
thought was not of dependence upon the Government, but upon their. own right
arms.
.1 saw that great parade, with the gallant and lamented General Sherman at
Its head, sweep by the treasury of the United States, and there was not a greedy
eye turned toward It. Every eye was toward home, and the hurrying footsteps
were "bent thither. Every boy who had been spared In the great struggle was
anxious i to he again at the plow or inthe shop or in the office to take up again
the. work he had laid down that his country might live..
. Their, hearts went faster than the quickstep of the march, on to the humble
homes from which they had gone out. to the lovtd ones they had left there.
;The Grand Army of the Republic has rightly claimed that the man who fell
by the^way in the battle of life, from disease, or casualty, or advancing years,
and lost the capacity to maintain himself, should be cared for by the nation he
helped to save, and not be dependent upon the township poor fund.

What does this soldiers' and sailors' monument mean?
It means the Immortal principle. of patriotism. It means love of country
It means sacrifices for the country we love. It means, not only love of coun
try, but love of liberty! This alone could have inspired over 2,800.000 Unlor
soldiers to leave home and family and to offer to die if need be for our im
periled Institutions.
Love of country alone could have inspired 200,000. men to die for the Union
Nothing less sacred than this love of country could have sustained 175.000 bravÂ«
men, who suffered and starved and died in rebel prisons. Nor could anything
else have given comfort to the 600,000 maimed and diseased who escaped imme
diate death in siege and battle to end in torment the remainder of their patriot
lives. It Is a noble patriotism.
On the occasion corresponding to this, four
rears ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to
an impending civil war. All dreaded It All sought
to avoid It. While the Inaugural address was be
ing delivered from this place, devoted altogether
to saving the Union without war, the insurgent
agents were in the city seeking to destroy it with
out warâ seeking to dissolve the Union and divide
the effects by negotiating.
Both parties deprecated war, but one of them
would make war rather than let It perish, and
war came. * Â¦"'â¢Â¦-â¢.':/ *
One-eighth of the whole population were col
ored slaves, rot distributed generally over the
Union, but located in the southern part.. These
slaves contributed a ' peculiar and powerful Inter
est. All knew the Interest would somehow cause
war. To strengthen, perpetuate and extend thl3
interest was the object for which the Insurgents
would rend the Union by war, while the Govern
ment claimed no right to do more- than restrict thÂ» territorial enlargement of it.
Neither party expected the magnitude or duration which it has already at
tained: neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease even be
fore the conflict Itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph and a
result less fundamental and astonishing. Beth read the came Bible and pray
to the same God. Each Invokes his aid against the other.
It may eeem strange that any man should daro to ask a Just Gods as
sistance In wringing bread from the sweat of other men's faces: but let us
Judge not, that we be not Judged. The prayer of both should not be enswerert;
that of neither has been answered fully, for the Almighty has his own- pur
poses.
"Woe unto the world because of offenses, for it must needs be that offenses
come: but woe unto that man by whom the offense comelh."
W'th malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right,

7If they had
liedâ And then
Â¦he almost
laughed in bitter
mirth; for what
could she do If the
had lied? She was out
In the river now. and there
was no going: back. Go back?
Let poor Richey be shot? Xever: Not
if she knew that moment that there
never had been a Eandbar and that the
river was a thousand milrs wide! The
horse was drifting again and the short
er, sharper intake of his breath told
that he was beginning to tire. Where
was the sandbar?
At last she made it outâ a gray shad
ow on the waste of the level waters.
Thank God! they wsre well above it,
too. She moved the reins gently against
the horse's neck and he turned toward
it. .It seemed an hour before he struck
the sand, but at last he did and stood
panting on the little island.
â¢ It grew lighter and lighter as she sat
there In the wet saddle, waiting for the
horse to recover his wind and his
strength. She wished that she could re
lease the animal of her weight, but the
cold water had numbed her so that
she was afraid to get off. But she felt
sure that he would carry her over now,
-
for it was not so far to the other sidÂ«..
As the looked across she could see the
scattered houses of Missouriâ and her
heart rcse hopefully at the mere sight'
cf her goal. Over there, back of those
brown hil'.s, was Judge Fagg and the
reprieve!
The light Increased, and looking down
the river she. saw that the ferryboat
had swung out from. the Illinois side
and was crossing on its first morning
trip. .The people on the ferry had evi-'
denlly seen her, for- she caught the
wave of something white, and heard a
faint halloo. But she watched them
with a grim smile, and stroked the
horse's head proudly and lovingly. A
few moments later she Judged the horse
ready, and once more rode .him Into
the water.
The hors* Â«wam even better than be
fore, drifting fewer times, as though he
had more confidence in his strength.
But a3 they gradually neared the other
side a new fear came to the girl's mind.
They, could not reach the town landing,
but must land farther down; and far
ther down the bluffs seemed to riso
IT was long after midnight when a girl
on a foaming horse galloped into a
little settlement on the Illinois nlde of
the Misslesippi and was stopped by a
soldier sentry at the ferry landing.
The girl wanted to cross the river: she
must cross the river, she told the sentry,
for ehe had to see Judge Fagg. the Pro-
Marshal of Missouri, before morning.
It was a case of lue and aeath â she had
already ridden from Rockport, thirty
five miles away, since 9 o'clock, and it
*~s.s Imperative that she go on. A per
mit? No. she hadn't one: but this was a
particular ca.se. Couldn't they cross her
without a permit?
The sentry lit a lantern, perhaps to see
if the girl's face was as sweet as her
thrilling. Insistent voice. He saw that
It was, even by that indifferent light, from
the black, waving hair to the parted red
lips. He saw. too. that her eyes were
large and flashed earnestly; wd perhaps
his refusal would have come harder could
hÂ« hav* known how Intensely sky-blue
those eyes were, xiut at u was the sen
try regretted his orders and hammered
on a cearbv door to rout out his officer.
TnÂ» officer cam* forth, half dressed and
lU-bsmored. for he had been sleeping
soundly and the early morning air was
cola.
"Sorry, miss, but we can't do it. These
are war times, and we have strict orders
to pass no one without a permit. Get a
permit and the ferryi* take you."
"But that would take too longâ I would
be too late!"
"Don't know about that. Can't help it,
anyway. You'll have to get a written
permitâ or swim the river." The officer
was trying to be facetious.
ThÂ« girl's heart raged within her. Oh.
these brutal soldiers! But she stilled her
anger. "I suppose I could swim the river.
1* It very wide here?" â¢
"Only about a mile and a half, not
counting the eand-bar in the middle." The
officer was plainly amused.
"The sand-bar! In which direction is
that?" The girl spoke quickly, as though
suddenly Interested.
The sentry lifted his lantern and pointed,
wishing as he did so that he was an ofij
cer so he could kick somebody. "Right
out there, miss; but no one can swim the
ilver, cf course."
The uplifted lantern had revealed the
pirls face more clearly to the officer and
his tone changed.
'I'm very sorry # mist, that we can't
let you cross, but orders are orders . in
war time. Perhaps if you go for a permit
*t once you wUl be able to cross in time
for your purpose."
The girl turned her horse. "Thank you,"
she said, speaking to the sentry. "I'll
see if I can get a permit." Then she rode
back through the eettlement and disap
peared In the darkness.
The officer went back to his bed. the
?entry returned to his post, but the girl
had turned her horse and was making- her
way up the river. Here were the"bo>
tom lands," and soon she had to dismount
and lead "her horse through the heavy
timber. What was ehe going to do? She
was going to swim the river! It really
was a case of life. and death, and her hot
Southern blood was up. Shortly after
the- war had broken "out 1 she and * her
mother had moved from Missouri into
Illinois, for they both eympathlzed with
the South, and that well-known sympathy
had gotten them into . trouble. The girl,
â¢ 'assandra Manly, had been engaged to
Norton Bright, a fellow college-mate,
when the . run* of Sumter awoke the
country to tcÂ« tragedy of war; but Bright
Joined the Union forces, was c<t2* captain
cf his company, and Cassandra, in her hot
partisanship for the South, broke off the
engagement and would have nothing more
to do with him. Her contemptuous treat
ment of him appeared to madden Bright,
and aftef be bad' seen David Richey, a
neighbor's eon, in the girl's company once
or twice his tpite and Jealousy caused
Rlchey** arrest. Judge Fagg, Provost
Marshal of Misouri, released Rlchey, for
the charge against him was unfounded,
his sympathy, in truth, being with the
North, though he had not yet proved it
by Joining the Northern army. But now
Rlchey had decided to obey the impulse
of his real feeling and had come over to
Illlnolt to # bld good-by to his old Southern
Kirl playmate before he marched away to
fight against the stars and bars. Here
Captain Bright had followed him with
another trumped-up charge and had ar
rested him at the Manly house In Rock
port, and Just by accident Cassandra had
overheard Bright and his lieutenant dls
cueslcg his case. They would not take
him back to Missouri; 'they would give
him a "trial" on the morrow and shoot
him at eundown. Cassandra h*d nearly
fainted Â«t the fearfully cold-blooded plot.
But her weakness lasted but a short time,
for ehe realized that something must be
done, and done at once, if Ricbey was to
be saved. She could think of nothing ex
cept to go to Judge Fagg and get a re
prieve, for the Judge knew Richey and
had released him before, and Bright and
his men being Missouri troops, were still
under the Jurisdiction of Provost Marshal
I'aee.
So here she was, after her thirty-five
nil!e ride from Rcckport, in the darkness
r,f the early ir.orr.ing, laboriously thread-
Ing her army through the heavily wooded
"bottoms," with her mind made up to
Â«wim her horse across the river. It was
z. wild undertaking, but Union or rebel,
she nz.s determined that ehe would gave
Rlchey If It were possible to do eo.
At last 5he reached a point up the riv
Â«r from which, allowing for natural drift
ing, the thought the horee could swim to
the sandbar. For they must get to the
sandbar to rest, for the horse wa3 al
ready wcaitej by its night run.
Under a huge sycamore she stopped and
taking tha skirt of her riding habit, which
?he had removed on entering the woodc,
*?ie rubbed the horse down and blanketed
him with it. Then she waited for day
light, ar.d at last it seemed to be coming.
Slowly the landscape lightened, until she
could distinguish objects. The time had
come! She rolled her skirts around her
waist and pinned them securely. She
then freed the horse's mouth of the bit,
mounted leg a*tr!de. and taking the uru
oal surcingle, passed It across her lap
acd buckled it tigh:, Uu's fastening her
tm)t to the saddle. No?/ shÂ» was ready.
j"cr a few moments she sat on the horae,
locking out over the river. She heard the
water whimpering along the shore as
thourh trying to warn her: and she knew,
as she heard it, what a desperate chance
shÂ« was taking. If the river were a mile
niri a.ht'f wide it would be a long swim
to that central sandbar. And who could
tell what, sort of, a horse she had? Ho
might prove anything but a swimmer.
Well, she must risk It â there was no
other way, and Richey must be saved..
Tt was light â¢'hough now for her to make,
the venture, though the farther shore
wftg still scarcely distinguishable and a
faint gray haze lay upon the water. She
bent over and patted the horse's neck
and then ursed him down the crumbling
bank to the river. He took, to the water
well at first, but at breast high it seemed
to frighten him. He sniffed at It; stopped,
and then with a loud snort began to
back. The girl's heart sankâ he was go-
Ing to fail her. But she patted him soft
ly again, telling him that he must go,
and the animal seemed to understand,
for after dipping his nose into the stream
as it to assure himself that It was 'only
the stuff he drank every day. he auddenly
plunged forward and was soon swimming.
And what a swim for horse and rider!
In the haiy half-light of that early morn
ing the great flood of the mighty Missis
sippi seemed like some wide, moving sea.
The sandbar, somewhere out In the middle
of that waste of waters, could not be seen
in the dim light What if they had lied
to her and it wasn't there? What If she
drifted too far down stream and so missed
it? These fears and a hundred others
raced swiftly through the_glrl's mind as
6he clung tightly to the horn of the sad
dle, feeling the cold water washing
against her limbs and listening to the
snorting exhalation and the brief, sharp
intake of the horse's breath: v
Some horses 6wim low in the water,
with Just the eyes and cars and nostrils
free; but this horse was holding himself
well up, so that the water hardly touched
to the top of the saddle. And how splen
didly he swam! The heavily wooded shore
behind them was slowly receding and as
the girl strained her eyes looking ahead
she could make out more plainly each
moment the rugged bluffs and hills of the
Missouri side. But the water was fear
fully cold and the fresh wind of the river
chilled her through. Would they make
it? They must make it! She called be
seechingly to . the horse as . he stopped
swimming for a few moments and drift
ed with the current and the noble ani
mal, as though- understanding the . dire
necessity, began sv.lmmlng strongly
again.
They were well out in" the stream by
this timeâ the increased force of the cur
rent told her that- But -where was -
the sandbar?. Was there, ..
a sandbar? If they
bad lied. Oh, .
right out of the water. But the ferry. Peo
ple had spread the news that a* woman
was swimming the river an dalready sev
eral men and soldiers were running along
the' bank. As the horse brought her grad
ually nearer the girl saw that i'hese.peo
pie understood her danger, and were call-'
Ing to her to keep up stream as much as
possible. Then came The rear battle with
thÂ« river! The current was' swifter, the
horse was tiring and the inexorable bluffs
were menacing grimly. â¢ Must they fail
after all? Must they lose Just at the door
way of the goal? For aV, little -while' it
seemed so to both rider and watchers;
and then the horse seemed to realize him-,
eelf. that the supreme moment bad.ar
rived, and he swam fiercely. Five minutes
later a soldier caught him by the bridle,
and the horse, pawing heroically, gained
a footing on the rocky, bank! . .â¢ '"/Â¦.
It was a : Union captain 'who unbuckled
the surcingle and lifted Cassandra from
the saddle. But her Southern" heart, had
no time to rebel, even when he chafed
her cold hands and looked into her brave
blue eyes with tremendous admiration.'
Nor 'did she refuse his arm up the steep
shore, for her legs were 'cramped and
stiff, and her skirts, how let down, again,
were heavy with water^and dragged stub
bornly. This was no time to show, scorn
or disdain; the day was advancing, and
she must see Judge Fagg as soon as pos
sible. She cut in sharply on the captain's
queries as to why ehe had made that des
perate swim 'across the river, telling him
that she had important business with
Judge Fagg,' and asking where he lived..
The captain was a decisive young man
captains had need to be in those days.
Perhaps had. Cassandra been less beauti
ful* he might have tarried with more
questions; but the flash of those blue eyes
told him that quick work counted here.
He got a horse for her. he lifted her
bodily to the saddle, and with an im
pulsive pressure of her hand, gave her
the brief, directions: "Straight through
townâ a half, mile â big white gatesâ to
your left." And she went!
The gray-haired, grim-faced- provost
marshal listened t,o Cassandra's story
with grave attention. ; .
"Dave Richey? Why, I know his folks
âthey're Union.-.' t released him before
because of that. Why is he under arrest
has he turned rebel?"
The girl flushed at the word "rebel,"
and her eyes flashed.
"No,' Judge Fagg; lie is notâ aâ
rebel!: But I .am, and proud of it."
And then she told him' the' entire-^
storyâ of the broken' engagement with '
Captain Bright, his -mad Jealousy of Â¦â¢.

ThÂ« note Billy carried

"Thanks. I had no Inten*

Then for a week thera was
silence between them. Gray In
his anger cursed the Confederates
for lylne Idle on their arms Instead
of. making things so lively that ha
would have a chance to cool his rago on
them In buttle. But instead ho waÂ»
obliged to sit inactive In camp and daily
watch Helen Dennlson. and Hammett tha
foppish civilian go trotting alonp the Con

he fumed.
Kut one evening when the whole town
was in a ferment over the well authen
ticated rumor of long impending battlo
to come o nthc morrow Gray heard a
mighty yÂ»-lplrg and ki-yl-ing in the road
as he was skirting the camp on a final
round of inspection. He turned back to
find Billy rtnd a brindle bull terrier hard
at It. With judicious kicks he managed
to spt thÂ«m apart, and then his heart
came into his throat, for attached to Bil

Gray snatched it e.icerly. It hail been
*adly mutilated In the fray, but a few
words in one corner of the paper wero
still legible.
"I'm in terror over what might happen
to-morrow. I w:is just trying to make you

Miss Helen Dennison. sitting on the broad

It was Billyâ a wreath of oak leaves

5llk flag which fluttered bravely in tha
bretze. Prominent ois. the oak wreath
was an envelope addressed to herself:

Within the hour Cassandraand the Judge
appeared at the ferry, and this time the girl
had a permit to' crossâ and another/ paper-^the
reprieveâ was pinned under her bodice. The Judge
gave her an escort, also, and' directed that a good
horse be supplied "> her on the other side. "And I know

It was the 1 morning of that tragic day, April 15, 1S63, when
dÂ«d this he
t grunted disgust

It. had required pluck to get

When an hour had passed â a long,

ternately fann<"i himself with his hat and
waged unejiu*ri wnbat, with the mosqui
toes, which, ti^r.plte the .smoke, had de
clared hostilitiesâ Gray put on his hat
with a determined air and slid down from
the fence. As he did so he saw a cloud
of dust moving along the roadway in his
direction. Then out " of the dust-cloud
emerged a yellow dog, trotting along
heavily with bis tongue lolling from his
mouth.
At the sight of the man the dog gave
vent to a aeries of Joyful barks; he came
the remaining distance in long bounds,
and when he reached the man he stood
before him, his tall In violent .motion.

THE SUNDAY CALL.
8
A GIRL OF THE SOUTHOn Wednesday. July 1, the storm broke.
We were brimming over with patriotic
enthusiasm.
On May Â«. 18S3. I finished a nine
months' term as second assistant to the
principal of our echools. Of the experi
ences of the Inhabitants of Uie southern
border counties of our State during that
eprlng and summer, I need not epeak.
Business of all kinds was paralyzed, and
the dally reports of the coming of tht
rebels kept us in a constant fevÂ«Â»r of ex
citement. On June 26 they came, spc.it
the night and passed through toward
Harrisburg, burning bridges and spread
ing consternation everywhere. Little we
dreamed of the far greater horrors that
were in store for us.

ti raking out of the war I was a
teacher In the public schools of Get
tysburg, my native place, and thw
home of my maternal ancestors, who
were Its fJrst settlers.
the order: "Women and children to the
cellars: the rebels will shell the town."
We lost little time In obeying the order.
My home was on West High street, near
Washington, and in the direct path of the
retreat.
From 4 to 6 we were in the collar, and
those two hours I can never forget. Our
cellar was a very good one and furnlfheil
a refuge for many besides our own family.
The noise above our heads, the rattle of
musketry, the screeching of shells and
the unearthly yells, added to the cries
and terror of the children, were enough
to shake the stoutest heart. I am sure
that never were more fervent prayers
borne heavenward- Â¦
After the' rebels had gained full posses
sion of the towp some of our men who
had been taken prisoners were 1 standing
near tbt cellar window. Onn of them
asked if t=ome of us would take their ad
dresses, and the addresses of frlenda, and*
write to them of their capture. I took
thirteen and wrote as they requested. I
received answers from all but one, and
several of the soldiers revisited the plare <
of their capture and recognized the house
and the cellar window.
While the battle lasted we concealed I
and fed three men in our cellar. <
This is not the place to tell of the horri
ble sights which met our eyes when wo
were allowed to come above ground. (
The Roman Catholic Church and the
United Presbyterian Church, a few doors
east of us, on opposite sides of the street,
had been taken possession of as hospitals.
Dr. James pulton, assistant surgeon of
the Oue Hundred and Forty-third Penn
sylvania Volunteers, had been working
hard to get things In some sort of shape
for the wounded, who were rapidly filling
the churches. He asked mother's permis-
Fion to use our kitchen and cook stove
for them. It was gladly given and from
that time we knew no rest, day nor nighf,
fur many long weeks.
On Thursday morning Dr. Fulton camo
to us and said: "Girls, you must come
up to the churches. Our boys arc suftW
lng for want of attention." L'p to thy',
time I thought I could do nothing except
work out of sight of the wounded, out I
could not resist that call.
I went into the Roman Catholic Church.
The men were scattered all over it, some
lying in the pews and some on the bare
floor. The suffering and groans of the
wounded and dying were terrible to seo
uvtl hear.
I. knelt by the first one inside the. door
and said: "What can 1 do for you?" He
looked up at me with mournful, tearless
eyes, and said: "Nothing; 1 am going to
die."
To be met thus' by the first one I ad
dressed was more than my overwrought
nerves could bear and I went hastily out.

send them his dying message of love.

the rebels 1 went back and forth between
my home and the hospitals without fear.
The 50ldlers called me brave, but I am

Sergeant Eaton was suffering very much.
His back had been very badly Injured by
a piece of shell, and he could neither
stoop nor turn his head. The doctors and
nurses were all busy. Captain Eaton said
he knew how the wound should be
dressed, but as he was not able to do It
he would take the responsibility and su
perintend the Job if I would do the work.
I went to work and we succeeded in re
lieving him.
One of our boys had lost a leg. He had
been with us several days and had be

frequently they sang for him. His favo

Two years later he was married and

waists that have the. Russian, Armenian
arid Oriental trimmings, will &U be fash

And. speaking of rags, what a season It
is for the girl who can do her own mend
ing. Big pieces of coaris- lace are set In
Going to a good shop she bought a
waist of lawn of the most exquisite tex
ture. The color was a clear blue white.
Set into the sleeves were very wide bands
of antique lace while great puffs of the
lawn fell at the back of the sleeves. The
uppers were tucked and so tightly made
as to fit the arm like a glove. /
The yoke was one of those two storied
affairs, looking like two yokes. A square
lace yoke was bordered with a band of
organdie with hemstitching on each edge.
Then came another, yoke-like square also
bordered with a band of ; organdie and
then another. Bands of lac* went down
the front and the waist was fastened in
the middle of the back under a wide slat
of organdie.
A woman, on bargains Intent, came in
to town the other day to replenish her
summer wardrobe a little. And, of course,
the thing she most desired was a nice
shirt waist.
A Little Shopping Tour.
It looks as though nothing new could
come in for winter beyond that which is
already seen or indicated. The early fall
supplies are Â»o abundant and so beauti
ful that woman will Invest in them and
will hesitate about throwing - away her
purchases for others Â«.. little later on.
It is the best of economy to buy a waist
now, for prices are low, goods-are marked
down, and you can get waists for 15 and
less, waists that were $10 earlier In the
season. New goods are constantly arriv
ing, and the dealers feel that they must
get rid of the old at any "sacrifice.'
If a woman is not too particular about
buying the very latest, and there are few
women who can afford to be critical,
there can . now be obtained the choicest
and most beautiful waists at prices so
low as to rightly rank In the bargain line,
whether they are on the bargain counters
or not.
tcr. In this way a waist is given a very
long lease of life.
* * Â«^-T WOMAN should buy her 6hirt
* * f \ waists standing up, and before
I I a full length mirror," declared
>â¢ I the head of a shirt waist de-
partxnent.
"And she should try them on before
buying.
"I know It would make us a great deal
of trouble,** continued she. "If all our cus
tomers were to try on their shirt waists.
But I really do believe that In the long
run it would be a saving of time, of pa
tience and of money all around.
"The woman who tries on her shirt
waists in the store never brines them
back to be exchanged; and it Is very rare
ly that a shirt waist that is tried on in the
â¢tore falls to give perfect satisfaction.
We have made many permanent custom
ers simply by Insisting that the waist be
tried on before It is taken home.
"Of course the exception is in the case
of the woman of perfect figure, who runs
true of the measure. And there are a
great many of this description.
"But the most Important reason Is that
women never know how they wlli look in
a garment until they put it on. And not
only must they put it on. but they must'
stand in front of a full length glass and
look at themselves, waist, skirt and all.
A waist that looks all right on the coun
ter, or on the figure, or when viewed with
a h&r.d glass, will look entirely different
when the woman sees herself full length.
"Take the new waists." said she, "which
are trimmed with little appllqued trian-
Kies of silk. The waists which are of
very delicate fabric are made on the
PYench etyle. opening down the back.
The fronts and the baggy part of the
sleeves arc trimmed with the silk trian
gles.-and these are put in place with very
email Pitches. The effect of the trim
ming is to make a figured waist.
; "Just about one woman in a dozen looks
well in these new waists and the others
look dowdy. To help them out they have
bow a way of striping Ihe waists with
narrow bands of ribbon, or of pin tucking
the waist, which gives It Jttst the right
amount of chic, so that its awful plain
r:ese does not come too hard upon the
woman whose figure Is not perfect."
And with this piece of advice the head
cf the shirt waist department walked,
â¢way to show the new midsummer crea
tions to some waiting .customers.
There is one very noticeable thins; about
feT AUGUSTA PRESCOTT.
Many of the nicest summer shirt waists
are made with an eye, to being worn In
the winter time. They are' provided with
inner waists made of taffeta > and * these
inner waists, , being separate, can be re
moved and put away while: the hot
-weather lasts, then brought out for win.
A very nice example of this In found in
a tucked lawn, which Is laid in panels of
tucking and insertion, each panel being
no more, than one inch wide. The yoke
and stock are composed of very simII
squares of white lawn fastened together
with hemstitching. The entire waist is
made by hand, and one can just imagine
the very great amount of work that was
put upon it before It wm completed.
Each little square was hemmed, then
Joined to the next square with fine hem
stitches. ."â¢' Â¦
For Summer or Winter.
Of course, the waists will be entirely too
thin for cold weather wear unless there
Is a nice and sufficient underwaist, and
for this purpose there will be some very
delicate corsot covers made of fine flan
nel, with long sleeves and high neck, so
that a warm lining is provided. The flan
nel will be silk flannel and in certain
grades of this silk flannel the luster is
so high as to look like satin, seen through
the meshes of the gown. Borne of these
show beautiful bands of lac* insertion.
And ii is only right and proper that the
summer waists should be worn next win
ter. It would be a pity wer* they to be
cast aside at the end of the season, for
there Is eo much work upon them that
they v are worthy to hold a permanent
place In the wardrobe.
AH of the thin lawns, the challies. the
mulls, and the organdies are trimmed with
lace and made in such a dressy way tha*

very handsomely trimmed with silk fag
oting, making them dainty little works
of art. >V*
the waists that are now being sold and
this Is the fact that they are designed
also for next winter wear. When you
buy a waist now, be it taffeta or organdie,
It is understood that you are to wear it
as long as a rag of it remains. It is cut
in such a manner that It looks dressy for
any season, and it is nice now and will
be still nicer later on.

Occasionally, in a very well made waist,

These lace uppers are very nice and will
look well later on when the waist is worn

But,* in buying now, one must use a
great deal of judgment if the waist is to
be worn next winter. There are styles
that will hold their own for a season to

or so, and the woman who wants to look
nice next winter must get the, sort of

WHO IS YOUR HERO?
fpv jlJ^T^ d HI^ is a remarkable year from the point of view of the
l/'l^HEF^O honor whicn is bein S P aid the mi R ln y spirits of the past,
li- Al-B VJ ; S Seldom do we encounter so close to one another so many
li^AB/A^I important personal anniversaries. Echoes of the Emerson
j '^^VliBSr^f centennial had hardly died away before from one end of
i *^*;-/^lf*i e this Iand to the other thc P raises of JÂ° hn Weslcv wcre
!jJ_2>'Triiii2^Ji heard. In the autumn the bicentennial of the birth of
Jonathan Edwards, New England's masterly theologian, will be widely cele
brated, while Henry Ward/ Beecher's already great fame is sure
to be enhanced through the movement for a suitable memorial of him
which is taking form in Brooklyn.
One of the most interesting features of these various commemorations
is the eagerness with which thc whole Christian world acknowledges its in
debtedness to the gerat leaders of the past and claims the privilege of ac
cording them public honor. *.:/ ',.5
This is as it should be. A great man is the property of no single sect
or school. If Ralph Waldo Emerson saw farther into the heart of things
than any man of his day. if his profound optimism and his sense of the divine
presence in the world were phrased in as limpid, vigorous English as has
ever been written, then why should not every denomination get the benefit
of his insight and his good cheer? If John Wesley's trumpet call to his
fellow Christians not only woke them" up and marshaled them (or conflict,
but helped deepen the entire current of church life ever since, let us believ
ers of every name and in every clime get and hold what inspiration we can
from such a devoted and heroic life. \Y ..â¢ .â¢ . " ...
I count it also a gain that we arc passing from a period in which our
heroes were chiefly warriors to an era in which our admiration and homage
are going out toward moral and spiritual heroes. It was natural after our
clash with Spain to laud and lavish gifts upon the admirals and^- generals
who kept the honor of the country unstained and fought our battles through
to so triumphant a finish. But we ought to reserve our deepest reverence
for the heroes of thought and of moral action. The men who have^ helped
the world to see God. the men who against great opposition have insisted
that thc spirit of man is the noblest part 'of him, and should always dominate
the flesh, the men whose victories have been wrought by love and kindness,
who have poured themselves out lavishly that _Â£he lives # of their fellows
might be gladdened and enriched, enlightened and emancipated, these are
the real benefactors and insoirers of the race. Their .glory continues, not
through a few fleeting months, but through the years and the centuries.
By the way, have you any hero? Is there any great moral or spiritual
leader to whom you look for guidance in your thinking and inspiration
for your living? If you have none then it is time you found one. I have
mentioned the names of some. I can suggest others, and still another
greater than them alL He will never fail you.

pll^M^Â»<l. Never learn anything about your men except from
|Â«siiiSi^f^ B themselves. A good manager needs no detectives, and the
fellow who can't read human nature can't manage it. The
phonograph records of a fellow's character are lined in his
face, and a man's days tell the secrets of his nights.
Be slow to hire and quick to fire. The^time to discover lncompatabiUty
of temper and curi-papers is before the marriage ceremony. But when you
find that you've hired the wrong man, you can't get rid of him too quick.
Pay him an extra month, but don't let him stay another day. A discharged
clerk in the office is like a splinter in the thumbâ a center of soreness. There
are no exceptions to this rule, because there are no exceptions to human na-
Uf Never threaten, because- a threat is a promise to pay that it isn't always
convenient to meet, â¢ but . if you don't make it good it hurts your credit.
Save a threat till you're ready to act, and then you wont need it. Irf all
. your dealings remember that to-day is your opportunity; to-morrow some
other 'fellow's. \ .
Keep close to your men. - When a fellow's sitting on top of a mountain
he's in a mighty dignified and iexalted position, but if he's gazing at the
clouds he's missing a heap of interesting and important doings down in the
valley Never lose your dignity, of course, but tie it up in all the red tape
you can find aroifnd the office and tuck it away in the safe. #
It's easy for a boss to awe his clerks, but a man who is feared to his
face is hated behind his back. A competent boss can move among his men
without having to draw an imaginary line between them, because they will
see the real one if it exists. *
Besides keeping in touch with your office men you want. to feel your
salesmen all the time. Send each of them a letter every day, so that they
.won't forget that we are making goods for which we need orders; and in
sist on their sending you a line every day, whether they have anything to
say or not." When a fellow has to write in six times a week to the house
he uses up his explanations mighty fast, and he's pretty apt to hustle for
business to make his seventh letter interesting.
Right here I want to repeat that in keeping track of others and their
Â¦faults it's very,. very important that you shouldn't. lose sight of your own.
Authority' swells up some fellows so that, they- can't see their corns; but a
wise man tries to cure his own while remembering not to tread on his
neighbor's. .1 fflBfflfflffl

Old Gorgon's Letter to His Son on Managing Men.
PASTELS IN PORK.
About this time his parent on his father's side conceived the idea that if .
he could inject a little higher education into his promising offspring it
would be a good thing for the said offspring and for the community at
large, as well as for himself, since he would get the young: man. out of the
house for a few years.- So U. S. G. Jenks hied him away at the uniform rate
of 3 cents per hie to an institution of higher (ed) learning. There he elected
a difficult course, consistine of the literature of the ancient Afghans, draw
ingâto a pair â and laboratory work in the most approved method of color
ing a meerschaum pipe. For four long, weary years he battled in the noble
cause of higher education: at times his old man thought that if it had been
any higher he couldn't stand for it very long.
During this time U. S. G. lenks' ambitions underwent a subtle change.
During his freshman "year he was of the opinion that no career was half so
glorious as that of the plunging fullb:;ck of the varsity eleven; the* only
trouble with that idea was that he had never heard of any one making his
living thafway for more than three months* out of the year, although a few
had accomplished the less: difficult task of dying without any perceptible loss
to the community.' This was an insuperable obstacle to his entering into the
fullback business as a life calling, since his esteemed parent had forcibly in
timated to him more than once that the jnanner in which he wasted his time
after he left college must be sufficiently "remunerative to pay his laundry bills,
at least. His father was old-fashioned and without any idea of the real end
and aim of education, which is not to teach a man how to make money, but
how to spend it. U. S. G. J.'s proud young heart'rebelled. after the style
of proud young hearts on such occasions, at the thought that he should
have to spend his waking h6urs in the vain pursuit oka livelihood, but inas
much as the old man was sitting on the treasury, he submitted:
In his junior year Jenks hit upon a scheme that seemed to him to prom
ise a happy solution of all his problems. He would marry a bank account.
To be sure, there would probably be n wife attached, but that was a mere
.matter of detail. Many bank accounts have wives attached to them: in fact,
it is not a difficult thing for any one to become attached to a cov. jetmne
bank account, and the more it. retires the more attached we are to it.. The
only fly in the liniment is the fact that the affection is seldom reciprocated.
U. S. Grant Jenks proposed to get over this difficulty by entering into the
holy bonds â and stocks â of matrimony. Then would all be plain sailing; his
wife might hold the bonds, but he would clip the coupons: ;
But to hit upon the risrht amount of full paid, \ non-assessable capital
stock with the proper feminine annex was not such a simple thing as it had "
appeared to the callow youth. The difficulty was not with the incomes; there,
are plenty of those waiting around for some desirable, male' chaperon- to
come along and exercise the divide right of benevolent assimilation over
them. It was-the femrnine annex that was constantly queering the game.
No sooner would U. S..G. T. cast his amorous glance upon a fair and blush
ing bank account that seemed butto tarry for his comincr than he would
discover to his righteous -indismation that it had plighted its sacred troth
to a similar account of the male persuasion. Full^ft, if^not oftcncr.'did he
At last he was forced to admhv to himself that marriage as a door of op- .
portunity to ambitious and struggling youth was closed. .Birds of. a feather^
flock together, and U. S. G. Jenks didn't have enough feathers. Then he\
turned his attention to other fields of activity that lay green and smiling be- Â¦.-;
fore him. He tried the law. but after he had studied Blackstone's tuneful lays V
for fifteen or twenty minutes he wearied of the pursuit of things litigious and
decided to take a fall out of something that was less of a strain on" his' alleged
brain. Medicine beckoned, but Jenks had been : cut " upâ and \. butâ so
"many times that he didn't have the heart ko practice the gentle art on^any one
elsV Business was profitable, but inasmuch as he had not been' born on a
New : England farm or brought over from ; the old country in ' the steerage
with only 15 cents, in his pocket, that door was also closed to him. He
thought of the ministry, that last refuge of the soul-oppressedâ by hard
work â but the thought of the novels that he would â¢ have ; to : write if he
amounted to anything'in that sacred calling gave him pause., Besides, no
man who had dreamed of marrying an heiress could Â«'Â¦ be expected to settle
down for life on a princely stipend of thr^e hundred and seventy-six dollars a
year, collected by himself. " , ' -
U. S. G. Jenks was plunged 'in deep, dark brown despair when ahappy
thought struck/'him in the solar plexus of the cerebellum. He would invent
in his youth he had burned to be a champion long-dis
tance aeronaut and skin the" cat from the trapeze of a hot-air balloon 4756
feet above the gaping multitude at the Putnam County Fair. There is no
necessary connection between ambition and hot air; it just happened that
way in U. S. G. Jenks' case. When he grew older he yearned with a triple
power yearn to be the best baseball pitcher in America and have his name on
the front page of the sporting section of every Sunday paper of the land
from Machias to Seattle. But that was not to be. Good pitchers are scarce,
and only a few of us can rise to that proud eminence, so U. S. G. J. was
forced to put an overhead check and a curb bit on his aforesaid vaulting
ambition and send it at a lower fence.
It is in the pious hope that his career may serve as an ex
ample to the young manhood of our fair land that the re
cital of the struggles into which his vaulting ambition
pushed him is here set down and left. There can be no
question that U. S. G. Jenks' ambition was vaulting. Even *
OME men are born great, some commit murder, and some
just butt in: U. S. Grant Jenks belonged to the last class.
a new breakfast food. Then would his name go echoing down the ages along
with Lydia E. v of sainted memory, th e late Mr. Mellin and Mother Eddy.
Future generations would rise up and call him blessed â or something elseâ
and he could go to his grave at the appointedâ or disappointedâ time with
the proud consciousness that he had left a deep impress on the life of his
little day. . . - -.^r-? " '-. '
It was no sooner said than done. That is, the public were done.
Jinksettes, composed of equal parts" of chopped straw and apple seeds, were
on the market and soon the breakfast table that was without them was the
abomination of desolation. Children cried for themâ after eating themâ
and every doctor, who stood to get a rake-off from the undertaker, recom
mended them. U. S. G. Jenks' name was a household word, and when he
died full of honorâ and chopped strawâ the great <and mighty from- near and
far came and stood at his bierâ to make sure that he was dead. ?>'Â£*â¢'
His life teaches us an impressive lesson that should be brought home to
every high-browed aspirant for fame. Verily, an 'easy graft is more to be
desired than a hand-made college 'education, and he who obeys the old in
junction to do others as they expect to be done?can laugh at the Shcnfi and
look Bradstreet's in the face without winking.

In April, 1865, more than a million of men were in the military service of
the United States. To these must be added a roll of names which at that
time numbered over three hundred and fifty thousandâ the. grand army of
the dead. * â¢
During the four years of the desperate conflict altogether 2,850,132 men
had been enrolled in the military service. There had been killed in battle 67.
058: died of wounds and other injuries, 43.032; of disease, 224,586, and from
causes not classified, 24,852 â a total death-roll of 359,528.
This vast army had taken part in more than two thousand engagements,
many of them of minor importance as to the number of men^engaged or re

THE SUNDAY CALL.
12The history of these "Women of the
War" has been an almost unwritten one.
When the war closed and their duties
ended they went quietly to their homes
and took up the daily routine of woman's
work. In 1SS1. however. Miss Dix invited
all nurses whom she could reach to meet
her lÂ» Washington and many responded.
An organization was effected called the
â¢â¢Ex-Army NurÂ»Â© Association of the Dis-
And it can scarcely be realized In this
ag:e. when the glorious Red Cross, with
iU perfect system of trained nurses, has
made the vocation of the nurse an hon
orable distinction, when the United
States army and navy are employing wo
men as nurses, what nerve and patriotic
devotion it took for the young women of
the sixties to brave public opinion and
enlist for hospital and field service. But
as there was no lack of brave men to do
the fighting, there was not found wanting
those willing to care for them when tick
or wounded. Dorothy L. Dix, that grand
est of women philanthropists, who of
fered her services at the beginning of the
war, was appointed by the Government
to enroll the nursee. but as 6t)e would
take none under 30 years of age scores
oÂ«. young matrons and maidens were en
rolled by generals, surgeons and colonels
of regiments, serving as volunteer nurses,
without pay. rendering heroic service.
THERE is no association that comes
to near to the veterans of the G. A.
R. as tha little band of gray
haired women who will represen'.'at
this encampment thÂ© National As
sociation of Army Nurses of the Civil
War. Their history is interwoven with
that of thÂ© boys in blue, and like the
Grand Army their association cannot bo
perpetuated.
These are . the heroic women who In
their early womanhood, filled with the
same spirit of patriotism that Bent to the
defense of the flag their fathers, hus
band*, brothers, lovers, went to the front
to care for the sick and wounded sol
dier*. >
Mrs. Woodley was elected national
president, serving for three years, and
doing much to establish and strengthen
the order. She was succeeded by Mrs.
Elizabeth W. Ewing of PhoenlxvlUe, Pa.,
for one year, then MIbs Ada Johnson of
St. Louis filled the office for two years.
Mrs. Delia A. Fay of Upper Jay. N. Y..
succeeded her. and at Washington Mrs.
Margaret Hamilton of WakeHeld, Mass..
was elected. At Cincinnati the words, "of
the Civil War," were substituted for thÂ«
"late war" to distinguish the association
from that of the Spanish-American War
Nurses' Association.
The object of the association Is to keep
green the memory of those years of civil
strife, to keep in touch with the Grand
Army in its efforts to promulgate the
grand principles for which they fought,
to seek out and aid the unfortunate and
needy nurses and assist them In procur
ing pensions. Those admitted to member
ship must be women of good moral char
acter, who have served in hospitals or In
the field as regular or volunteer nurses.
This society was not a national onÂ©, be
ing incorporated for the District of Co
lumbia, all itÂ» regular meetings being
held In Washington. It therefore become
desirable to form a national organization,
to meet annually at the National En
campments, and at the National Encamp
ment at Louisville in 1835 Mrs. Emily C,
Woodley of Philadelphia, acting on the
advice of comra.les of the G. A. R.. called
the nurses present together- and organ
ized an association to be known as "Tho

Harriet P. Dame, who has since gone to

The application must be indorsed by the
officers of the Grand Army of thÂ© Re
public post where the applicant resides.
ThÂ© first organization of. Civil War
nurses was the Veteran Nurses' Associa
tion, organized In Philadelphia during the
war, and of which Mrs. Emily B. Wood
ley is the aole survivor. Philadelphia has
a local organization of some fifteen mem
bers, called thÂ© Andrew Q. Curtin Nurse
Corps. It meets regularly and its entire
membership belongs to the national asso
ciation. Massachusetts has the only regu
larly organized State association, having
between forty and fifty members. They
meet each month in the State House. In
Boston. The Grand Army of the Republic
of Massachusetts has ever been mindful
of the nurse* and at the late Legisla
ture had a bill paased granting State aid
to the loyal women and placing them on
the same footing as the veterans.
At the convention held In Washington
last year the national gecrÂ«tary was ap
pointed to bring this matterv before tho
different States and endeavor to have
their Legislatures pass bills similar to that
of Massachusetts, and the measure, haa
become a law in Wisconsin and Kansas.
In Pennsylvania the Legislature passed
a bill, but the Governor vetoed It on
technical grounds. A bill was Introduced
in the Missouri Legislature granting a
pension to both Union and Conferedute
nurses, but was killed In committee.
By act of Congress all nurses of the
Civil War are eligible for burial in any
United States cemetery, and several now

ment grants pensions only to nurses reg
ularly employed In hospitals of 512 per
month, and for the year ending June 30,
1902, the Pension Department reports 634
receiving pensions, twenty-eight having
died during the year.
The volunteer nurses, doing equally as
good service and suffering thÂ© discom
forts and dangers of the field, are de
barred by the law governing pensions,
except when they are pensioned by pri
vate bills.
The National Association now numbers
151 members In good standing, three hav
ing died during the year, and are proud
to have on their roster as honorary mem
bers Clara Barton, whose work during
the Civil War and as president of the
American Red Cross has made her name
reveyenced and loved In all lands, and
Mrs. Mary A. Liver more, whose work
with the United States Sanitary Commis
sion will live as long as the history of
the war exists.
The Nurses' Association is not a bene
ficiary one, and the nuestion is asked,
"What good does It do for the Grand
Army?" This can best be answered by
the veterans themselves, many of whom
will see perchance at this encampment
in one of these gray haired women the
pentle face that his eyes first rested upon
when they opened after tne work of the
surgeon's knife was done, or the cool
hands that smoothed his fevered brow
or hcUl the cooling drink to his parched
lips.
While many of these nurses are from
SO to 90 years of ace, others are yet
bright, active women, and all belong to
the W. R. C. or Ladies of the G. A. A.,
where ther are still working for their
boys; but it is a sad thought that therÂ©
will not be many more meetings of these
veteran women of the Civil War for
Foon they, like their comrades of thÂ©
Grand Army, will have gone In to "those
gr^en tents, the curtains of which never
outward swing."

DURING the great Civil War the
State of California, so far. as open
hostilities tn the field were con
cerned, occupied a position . of
"splendid Isolation." When the
war broke out the Pacific Railroad was
but the dream of a few lmpractlcables.
The first transcontinental telegraph line

was carried from St. Louis to California
by means of the Pony Express until Oc

mail to reach the coast by this method.
When Californlans went East they gen
erally^ Journeyed by way of the isthmus.
The trip across the plains was fraught
with too much danger and hardship.
The population of the State was heter
ogeneous. The great gold rush of 1849 had
caused California to be overrun by a
strange mixture of people. Blue-blooded
New Englanders. "heirs tojthe polish of a
far-reaching ancestry." had left their
homes to build up fortunes in the mines.
Elemental men from Texas." who had
never' attended school but. on* day. and
that day being a rainy day, the teacher
failed to appear, came hither to dig for
gold. Immigrants from the backwoods of
Arkansas and Missouri Jostled with court
ly adventurers from the Old World. Chi
nese and Kanakas had been lured from
> their Flowery Kingdom and their Island
Paradise by the wonders of the new El
Dorado. Men who said "I ain't one of
your abolitionists; why. my uncle' had a
nigger." associated with dyed-in-the-wool
opponents of the "peculiar institution."
Fugitives from Justice and men who had
been used to luxury and adherents of the
law worked side by side. To make of such
a population of this a loyal Union favor-
Ing population was the task of the sup
porters of the Union. The people of the
State -held to their Inherited vprejudices.
The men from New England were as
stanch advocates of liberty and Union
In California as they had been In their
birthplaces. The immigrants from the
Southern States sympathized openly with
the secession movement. The adherents
of the loyal' North outnumbered the
Southern sympathizers, but the latter on
account of social position and political
prestige constituted an element of great
danger. J
' Prior to the beginning of the struggle
| Colonel E. D. Baker was the mouthpiece
of the Union cause. During the trouble
Thomas Starr King stirred up the whole
Pacific Coast with his fervid appeals to
I patriotism. The history of the Civil War
days In California centers mainly around
the deeds of these two men/
E. D. Baker was born In England, but
at as early age cams to the United
States. His career was yie typical, varied
career of the self-made man. He had a
passion for books. He fought In the
Black* Hawk war, was a Congressman
from an Illinois district, went to the
Mexican war as the colonel of a Western
regiment and returned with a brilliant
record. In 1S32 he came to California and
at once leaped Into favor as a lawyer
and as an orator. The speeches he made
In favor of the Union- cause remind one of
the battle speeches of Napoleon. He was
a practical man and had the gift of
prophecy. He saw a situation clearly and
faced it resolutely. Freedom and fame
v/ere the watchwords of this matchless
orator. He had great moral and physical
courage. He aspired to be elected to
Congress from this State, but was defeat
ed. Thereupon the defeated candidate be
took himself to Oregon and was elected
a United States Senator from that State.
It was while on his way to Washington
to take his seat in the Senate that he
made his famous. speech at the American
Theater in San Francisco. For two
hours and a quarter the Senator held the
vast assemblage, spellbound. Freedom
was the theme of the speech. The im
passioned words of the orator thrill to
this day, although the issue that called
them forth lies buried.. This speech was
made on tho 26th of October, 1860. Per
haps the noblest paragraph In 'the speech
is the following:
"We are a city set on a hill. Our light
cannot be hid. As for me, I dare not, I
will not be false to freedom. Where In
my youth my feet were planted, there
my manhood and my age shall march. I
will walk beneath her banner. I will
glory in her strength. I Have seen her, in
history, struck down on a hundred chosen
fields of battle. I have seen her friends
fly from her; I have seen her .friends
gather around her; I have seen them bind
her to the stake; I have seen thpm give
her ashes to the winds, regathering them
that they might scatter 'them yet more
widely. But when they turned to exult,
I have seen her again meet them face to
face, clad in complete steel and brandish
ing in her strong right hand a flaming
sword of red with Insufferable light! And
I take courage. The genius of America
will at last lead her sons to freedom!"
At the great New York mass meeting
held on April 19. 1861, Baker was one of
the twenty prominent men who contrib
uted their oratorical powers in behalf of
the Union. Baker saw that the hour of
conciliation had passed; that the nation
bad before It a bloody, Internecine war,
and accordingly he used all his powers to
fan the recently kindled fire of war Into
a billow of flame. He said that he had
come a wanderer from the Pacific Coast
to record his oath to sustain the majesty
of the constitution, along with the people
of the Empire State.
The war begun. Baker plunged into it
with all the Impetuosity of his nature.
On^June 28, 1361, he was commissioned
colonel of the First California Infantry,
recruited In the East and composed of
returned Californlans. He declined the
appointments of brigadier general and
major general of volunteers, because the
acceptance of either would have neces
sitated his resigning the Senatorship. On
the 2d of August, 1861, Baker made an
impassioned reply to Senator Breckin
rldge of Kentucky. Breckinridge had
stoken against a proposed measure to
suppress Insurrection. Baker attended
the session of the Senate In the dual role
of Senator and colonel; he was clad in
the uniform of a colonel. The impression
produced by. this soldier statesman clad
In the habiliments of war was profound
He stirred up patriotic enthusiasm and
completely overwhelmed Breckinridge.
This was the last speech ever made by
Baker. He commanded a brigade at Balls
Bluff, where he < fell at the head of his
troops. A savage hand-to-hand fight'oc
curred^for.the possession of his body. At
last the Union forces recovered posses
sion of it and carried it to the river. Bak
er's loss was keenly felt.
-While thia renowned Western orator
was winning fame In the East by his
words and deeds a product of the East
fanned the war flame in the West. In
1SG0 Thomas Starr King, a Unitarian min
ister from Boston/became the minister
of the. First Unitarian Church of San
Francisco. Although of frail and sickly
body, he was filled with the spirit of lib
erty. When he saw that tue South in
tended to secede and disrupt the Union
he rushed into the lists and. did all in
hts power to make men see the folly of
the secession movement. - He believed in
human liberty with every fiber of his
being. He thought that the success of
the secession movement would* block hu
man progress, and accordingly he threw
himself heartland soul into an effort to
frustrate the scheme of the disruptlon
ists. I
Mr. King endeavored to cause the
steadfast to remain firm, and to bring the
lukewarm into the ranks of the sup
porters of the. Union. To, this doughty
champion of liberty the republic was an
anointed temple of the Lord. and. the at
tempt of the secessionists to break it' open
was a sacrilege.'. He had a firm grasp on
the principles on which the "fathers" had
t>asâ¬d their form of government, and h<s
attempted to rekindle in the breasts of
his generation the same sentiments that
had inspired the founders. He prepared
lectures on "Washington, Father of His
Country," "Lexington and Concord" and
"Webster, Defender of tho Constitution,"
all patriotic in the extreme, and threw
himself upon the disciples of the Confed
eracy. He traversed the State. He went
up the Sacramento Valley, over the
rough Sisklyou Mountains into Oregon
and from thence to Puget Sound. He
6poke for the Union, and for the woui-ded
soldiers. He materially assisted the ef
forts of the Sanitary Commission, that
body of patriotic men and women banded
together to assist wounded and needy sol
diers. In some places the orator's life
was threatened. Men who administered a
rude form of justice with the rlflo and
the rope in somq of the interior mining
towns drew weapons on him. But he was
not deterred, and in a short time it was
seen that the Pacific Coast was saved to
the Union. It was then that Starr King
took up the work of the Sanitary Com
mission. On account of tho lack of fa
cilities for transporting troops from the
Pacific Coast to the scene ' of war, the
Government did not call for troops from
this section for use In the struggle. Tne
energies of the men of the Pacific Coast
were therefore turned in another direc
tion.
i If the Government did not want the
*blood of the Far West, it did wanUits
treasure. The East sacrificed its blood
upon the altar of war, while the West
poured its treasure thereon in unstinted
measure. ; It is not too much to say that
the gold sent by [California, arriving as
it did at the most opportune time, had as
much to do with causing the downfall
of the Confederacy as did certain Union
successes In the field. Into this work of
raising money Starr King threw himself
with as much vigor as he had displayed
in his effort to make the State
loyal. , In 1864 this devout worshiper
of liberty -..died. On that- sad occa
sion San Francisco went Into mourn
ing. The city draped, itself in black;
the- big .'.smoothbores on Alcatraz
spoke out- their solemn notes; flags were
lowered to half mast and public offices
were closed. Thomas Starr * King laid
down his life for his countryias truly as
if he had fallen on the field of battle.
There were other Californlans who did
heroic. service In behalf of the Union, but
the names of Baker and King will ever be
linked in the history of this State as the
two foremost figures of Civil War days.
The one . frowned down on * the , secession
movement. He showed, the fallacy of the
arguments on which it was based. He
was a devout believer In freedom and ver-
lly believed in the maintenance of an in
dissoluble Union of indestructible States.
The other took up the work begun by the
former. He held to the same political
tenets and expressed them in a way calcu
lated to stir the spirits of men. If the
State of California ever takes advantage
of the act of Congress permitting the va
rious States to present statues of their
two most illustrious sons to the statuary
hall in the Capitol at Washington, two
more Illustrious than those of E. D. Baker
and Thomas Starr King cannot be sug
gested.
As before stated, the antebellum days
in California were mainly taken up in the
struggle of Baker and his colleagues to
meet the arguments of the secessionists,
while the war days saw Starr King and
his colleagues at work creating Union
sentiment and assisting in the work of the
Sanitary Commission. But there were
other happenings worthy of note in those
days. Tho population of the State was
made up of bo many peculiar elements
that all sorts of eccentric ideas were
given currency. One of the most absurd
propositions made prior to the beginning
of the struggle was the proposed estab
lishment of a Pacific republic. The Shas
ta Herald in 18S0 in discussing political
matters said:
"If disunion does come neither North
nor South need look for aid and comfort
from the Pacific Coast. The Almighty has
piled up the elements along these shores
for a great empire, and if it needs he can
make It one. We have no such interest
that would demand an alliance with
either of the belligerents upon the other
side. We are and have been for ten years
as fully separated from them as though
we were a foreign colony. This coast can
stand alone % and if disunion between
North and South ever comes it will stand
alone and Independent. When that day
comesâ if, unfortunately. It should ever
comeâ then 'long live the Pacific repub
lic* "
This proposition never gained much
headway, but it was particularly aggra
vating and called forth some scathing
editorials from the *Union press. The San
Francisco Bee in an editorial said:
- "Aside from a few disappointed office
seekers there are not to be found to-day
in California, outside of the State prison,
a thousand voices to give, encouragement
to, the reason."
As before Indicated, the Federal Gov
ernment made no call on California for
troops to use on Eastern battlefields. But
a large number of men were mustered
into service to protect mail and telegraph
lines, and* to keep down- Indian uprais
lngs, and to awe Southern sympathizers.
Less populous than any of the older E^aat-
era States, there was given to the Pacific
Coast the task of keeping loyal the ter
ritory ceded by Mexico In the treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo. Troops were scatter
ed over this vast area, and thÂ« task Im
posed was faithfully discharged. Many
Californlans, chafing at the enforced In
activity In military movements, betook
themselves to the East, and there en
listed.
The men elected to offlce In this Stats
during the struggle were In the main
"High-minded men." They were In
politics in response to patriotic senti
ments. There was a copperhead move
ment during the struggle that had to be
reckoned with. AH the Influence of the
Union clubs, the loyal press, and the
military department was called Into requi
sition to disrupt the misguided agitation.
In the election of 1S64 civil fludgeon ran
high. The State was undoubtedly for
Lincoln, but anxiety existed for the East.
The canvass was a warm one. Lincoln
carried the State by 20.000 majority. When
it became apparent that he was re-elected
San Francisco made a holiday. Men
marched about the streets cheering and
singing. In the re-election of the cham
pion of the republic the people felt they
had a man whom they could trust, and
whose policy was certain to bring victory.
When the news of Lincoln's assassina
tion reached the Coast men were horri
fied. It was feared that the war would re
open, that Union soldiers would revenge
his death by a general massacre of Con
federates. The financial condition of the
country became serious. But as In thÂ©
cases of the assassinations of Garfleld
and McKInley. the people saw tha.t the
striking of the President had no more
effect on the republic than the angry
striking of some venomous Insect of the
sea against the steel plate of a battleship.
Accordingly the men of San Francisco
prepared to pay their respects to the mem
ory of the martyred President in a solemn
runeral. Tho sight was very Impressive,
and the services held at Mechanics*
Pavilion were long remembered.
The war was over, the Union saved,
and Union hearts were filled with Joy.
California had done all that had been
asked of her. Routes of travel had been
guarded. Indian tribes had been held in
check. Taxes had been paid with cheer
fulness. Mineral treasure had been
poured out to assist In the preservation of
liberty. Half a million dollars had been
given by loyal hearts to the Sanitary
Commission to assist In mitigating the
sufferings of the wounded and to assist
the well being of those In the field.
Poured Into the ceffers of the Union at
an opportune time. It forwarded "the
Union cause on to victory.

A goose drill is being arranged, a score of little folks having been selected to take part. They will be made to look as much as possible. like goslings through the aid of a theatrical cos
tumer, who is making papier mache bodies and bills,. with funny adjustable ;webbcd feet and plenty of feathers. The^illwiU be performed by. the feet, which' the little folks will work by their
hands concealed beneath wings, which will work on wires." The effect is sure i to be very amusing. ' - . â¢â¢ i - V " * Â£ Â¦/-' : -:\ V ...\-'-' : - .-'" v/ 1 'Â¦"' '*'>

Mrs. Eliza J. Denver, the widow of the

was a brother of St Clalr. Denver, 'after
whom Colorado's chief city was named,
and her daughter have become hopelessly
insane at Coronado Beach and It has been
necessary to send them to a private asy

part of the State about four years and
until about a year ago they made Los
Angeles their home. They went to Cor

the hotel. They made many friends
among the people residing there, bui of
late have been acting strangely, refusing
to see their closest friends, ' and giving
everybody to understand that they wished
to be left alone.
After numerous fruitless attempts to
communicate with Mm. Denver and
daughter, people gradually began leaving
them alone. Within the past two weeks,
however, their actions have caused j some
alarm, and fears have been entertained of
a double tragedy being enacted within
the little cottage. An effort- was .finally
made to enter the house, but the windows
and doors were found barred and all"in
quirers were denied admission. The
couple even refused to receive their mail,
and the grocer and other tradespeople
were sent away without reason. Consid

OAKLAND, Aug. 15.â The suit brought
by Assistant Postmaster Paul J. Schafer
to annul his former wife's divorce at
Lincoln, Ncbr., is a sequel to Schafer's
attempt last June to gain possession of
hls~daughter Josrphlne in order to compel
her mother.Mrs. ZebuMnÂ« H.Schafer-Beck,
to return to Oakland that he might sue
for the custbdy of all of their children.
Schafer charges that the divorce was pro
cured by fraud and perjury: that he was
not given notice of the proceedings, de
epite the fact that he Is a prominent Fed
eral officer in Oakland. He declared that
the first time he learned of the divorce
was when his former wife exhibited docu
ments at the time of his arrest He also
discovered that the had married one Her
bert Beck, at whose door .Schafer lays
much blame for his domestic troubles.
Two years Â£go Mrs. Schafer eued her
husband for a divorce, but dismissed the
action and went East, taking their three
children. The abandoned father located
the family in Sacramento last November
and after months of planning abducted
his child Josephine. His scheme to get
her to Oakland failed, and Mrs. Schafer-
Beck caused the assistant postmaster's
arrest- He returned to Sacramento and
was completely exonerated. ;Ji Â¦-
Concerning the suit. Assistant Postmas
ter Schafer said: "That divorce was ob
tained in Lincoln without my knowledge
and is therefore void, because there was
and Is no legal reason why the proper
notice should not have been served upon
me. After Mrs. Schafcr was divorced by
fraud she married this man Herbert Beck
and has given my children his name.
That is why I am going to have this de
cree sot aside and then I shall make an
other effort to get my children. Every
move I have made In this matter has
been open and abovebcard. I -am the ag
grieved party and I purpose to settle this
trouble and cet my children."

LINCOLN. Neb., Aug. 15.â Paul J.
Schafer of Oakland. Cal., to-day, filed a
petition In the District Court at Omaha
to set aside the decree of divorce secured
last year by his wife, Mrs. Zebuline H.
Schafer. Echafer is assistant postmaster
ai "Oakland and was formerly private sec
retary to Congressman MetcaJf. His wife
married Herbert Beck, a young man of
Sacramento, three days after securing her
decree. The Â¦woman and her mother, Mrs.
Josephine Hunt Goodwin. - conducted a
Christian Science reading-room at Oak
land. Beck took an interest in Christian
Sckr.ce and made frec.uenf* calls on Mrs.
Schafer. The husband objected and or
dered Beck never to make his apeparance
at the place.
The young man came as before and was
struck in the face by Schafer. A charge
of assault was preferred and Schafer was
arrested, but was not prosecuted. Soon
after this occurred, in January, 1902, Mrs.
*!*cht>fcr went away. She was traced to
l\w*.nport, Iowa, and then to O'uMha, at
which place she remained six months to
secure legal reslder.ee in the State. At
the end of that time she secured a di
/vcrce-on the grour.d that her husband
was addicted to drink. She went with
Reck to Council Bluffs, Iowa, across the
Missouri River from Omaha, and the cou
pÂ»e were married. They returned to Sac
r.imento.
Schafcr claims he knew nothing of the
divorce until cne day when he was In
Sacramento he found his little daughter
on the street. He took her with him, but
was overtaken before he reached home by
Mrs. Beck, who exhibited a decree of di
vorce giving her possession of the chil
dren. His application asks that the de
cree be set aside because it was secured
by false and perjured testimony and that
his wife was not a bona fide resident of
Nebraska, having come to the State for
the purpose of securing the divorce. , He
p.Iso asks for the custody of the children.

year, taking everything "before it. More
than 1000 trees were taken out by the
roots, and barns, corn cribs, grain and
hay stacks, several droves of hogs and
many horses and' cattle were swept away
by the flood. Not a bridge, remains on

CARLSON INVESTMENT CO., Â»4 S. Broadway. Los Angeles, Cal.CTNTHIANA. Ky.. Auk. 15. â Judge Osborne
to-day overruled the motion for a new trial for
Jett ' and . White ' who â¢ were yesterday convicted
and given life 'sentences for the Marcura as
easslnatlon.
The jury was then charged by Judge
de Haven, and entered upon their delib
erations at 3:u0 p. m.'
. Then Mr. Woodworth took up the forged
certificates and . compared the signatures
with the admittedly genuine signature
of John C. Lync,h. showing the earmarks
of forgery. From that point he followed
the acts of the negro clerk through the
whole history of the case, and showed
how nil the acts that had been testified
to by the witnesses for the Government
proved to be strong links in the chain of
circumstantial evidence that had been
woven around DlHard.
Mr. Woodworth paid a high tribute to
the character of Mr. Lynch for truth and
integrity and earnestly defended him from
the scurrilous epithets that had ' been
Bhowercd upon him by the leading coun
sel for the defense.
The forensic battle ended yesterday
with United States District Attorney
Woodworth's reply to defendant's coun
sel.
United States District Attorney Wood
worth began the closing argument for
the Government in the forenoon, and
in reply to | the defense led the jury
through the tortuous windings of the ar
gument that had been made for the de
fendant by Mr. Shortridge. Mr. WoOd
worth caused a smile to ripple through
the courtroom by calling. Mr. Shortridge
by the name of "Foxy Quiller." the comic
character in De Koven's "Highwayman"
personated so effectively by Edwin Stev
ens. Mr. Stevens and Mr. Shortridge are
of the same stature and equally lithe and
lissome of form, and Mr. Woodworth's
comparison made a.' hit.
Mr. Woodworth in a vein of pleasantry
proceeded to say that he was sorfy that
the Government could not accommodate
the counsel -for the defendant with a
photograph of Dillard In the act of forg
ing the signature of John C. Lynch to
a Chinese certificate of residence, that
being evidently what they demanded In
the way. of proof against their client.
Deeds of that kind, he added, are usually
done in the dark, at home and after
offlce ,,hours. In laying bare what he
called the fallacies of the argument of
the 'counsel for the defense the " speaker
said that It simply was to the effect that
all the witnesses-, for the prosecutionâ
from John r C. Lynch down to the hand
writing experts and the District ' Attor
ney's offlceâ had engaged In a conspiracy
to convict Dillard by "means of perjured
testimony and false evidence. ; This, he
added, was too great a tax on the cre
dulity of any sane jury, more especially
since the defense had not attempted to
introduce a particle of evidence that could
In the most remote manner lend color to
that theory.
Former United States Revenue Clerk
William H. Dillard, accused of forging
signatures to certificates issued to Chi
nese, was found guilty last night on four
different charges. The jury retired for
deliberation at 3:30 o'clock yesterday aft
ernoon, and at 10 o'clock handed its ver
dic{ to Judge de Haven.
The decision occasioned no surprise to
those who were familiar with the testi
mony in the case. The trial occupied a
great deal of public attention. During the
trial the courtroom was crowded with all
sorts and conditions of men.
A number of defendant's friends, colored
and white, were present during the trial.
There was much interest in Chinatown,
and many Chinese were present through
out the trial.

ROME, Aug.- 15.â The consecration of
the Rev. J. J. Harty of St. Louis as Arch
bishop of Manila took place to-day In the

Interest to the ceremony was given by the
fact that the first Archbishop to be con
secrated under Plus X was an American.
Cardinal Satolli officiated and was as

ATLANTA, Ga.. Aug. 13.â The Georgia
Prison Commission, which has been In
vestigating the whipping of Mamie de
Cris, a white woman convict on the State
prison farm, made Its report to-day. With
the report came the announcement of the
resignation of Warden Allagood and its
acceptance by the commission.
The charges of Improper proposals by
Allagood, alleged by the woman, and sim
ilar conduct toward other female con
victs, are found to be absolutely false
and malicious. The report says the War
den acted entirely within his authority in
whipping Miss de Cris and that he was
led to it by severe aggravation.
The commission concluded that this
particular punishment was an "error on
the part of the Warden, who, recognizing
that his usefulness may have been Im
paired by reason of the prejudice against
him caused by the De Crls affair, has
voluntarily handed in hla resignation."

PARIS. Aug. 15.â "The danc* of the
American chorus girl Is the most original
and drliclous creation In all America,"
Is the verdict of Jules Huret, the French
newspaper writer who Is studying the
manners and customs of America for the
benefit of the French public. *Â¦
He thinks old Europe would be likely
to be distanced if the American chorus
girls should invade her shores. He de
fines the dance of the chorus girls as the
old French cancan step, embellished with
the waltz step and the Cakewalk. The
Joy and gladness the American chorus
girl puts into the dance gives the languid
dsneers of the grand opera "a black eye."

GREAT FALLS, Mont, Aug. 15.â The
love of Castale Gabuta and Lucia Tire led
to a tragedy at Great Falls this morning.
Gabuta, who Is a young mechanic em
ployed at the Boston and Montana smel
ter, had for a long time been paying at
tentions to Miss Tire, the 19-year-old
daughter of Angelo Tire, a small trader.
He was objectionable to both the girl's
father and brother. Joseph Tire, and an
elopement was planned. .
The father and brother discovered the
plans of the clovers and Gabuta was
warned no.t to see the girl again. The lat
ter was locked in the house, but man
aged to see her lover. The father learned
of it and with his son went to the house
where Gabuta lived at 5 o'clock this
morning and asked him to come out. As
he left the house the, two men sprang
upon him and said they meant to kill him.
He fired two shots and both struck the
old man, inflicting fatal wounds.
Young Tire wrenched the 'weapon from
the hands of Gabuta 'and beat him Into
Insensibility with It, fracturing his skull.
Believing Gabuta to be dead, he fled, and
all day eluded capture. When the girl
was Informed of the tragedy, that her
father , was fatally wounded, her lpver
likely to die and her brother a fugitive,
she became a raving maniac and had to
be placed under restraint.
A warrant was ordered issued for the
officer who told Gabuta to carry the re
volver.

added the Russian Foreign Minister, on

Russia's present action as fostering the
revolutionary agitation of tho Macedo

activity was a hindrance to the pacifica

peaceful Christian population suffered at
the hands of the revolutionary bands as

Macedonian frontier, where It touches the
district of Dubnitza, and he take a some
what optimistic view of the situation in
Macedonia. lie believes that the outbreak
will be confined to the vilayet of Monas
tir, where the Turks probably will succeed
in suppressing the insurrection.
Regarding the reports that Bulgaria was
responsible for the outbreak, he pointed
out that the center disturbed area was
nearly 200 miles from the Bulgarian fron
tier and was separated from it by a coun
try largely inhabited by Turks. Conse
quently, he Bald, it was foolish to say
that the movement was. aided by bands
from Bulgaria, and it was equally unrea
sonable to suggest that the arms of the
Insurgents came, from. Bulgaria. He as
serted that, aa a matter of fact, the guns
used by the insurrectionists were all of
French manufacture and that most of
them were bought from Turkish officers
and men who, receiving no pay, had re
ported to the aale of their guns and am
munition to obtain money. The Insurrec
tion, he declared, was entirely a national
Macedonian movement, organized by the
Macedonian, Internal committee.
This, in itself, was proof <Â»f the shock
ing condition of> affairs due to the excesses
of Turkish soldiers, who. on the pretext
of searching for arms. 'entered Macedo
nian villages, to plunder and destroy..
The situation in the unhappy villages,
he thought, had been rendered more des
perate by the reftiaAl of the Turks to per
mit tha unemployed to. leave In order, to
obtain work elsewhere. This goaded the
population to the . most desperate meas
ures. Premier Petroff declared that the
Bulgarian Government was doing its ut
most to maintain peace.

that they are Sufficient not only to sup

LIFE IS THBEATEWED
BY BEJECTED STJITOB
Two years ago Mrs. Evans also gained
*nmÂ» notoriety by horsewhipping a man
who had attempted to flirt with her.
Mrs. Evans had feared that her hus
band would kill her and had talked of
her fears last night. Bhe locked the door
of ber room when she retired, but by a
Etrange fatality unfastened It during the
r.ipht to pain fresh air. Evans evidently
had planned the tragedy deliberately. He
spent the night In a neighboring- saloon.
Ttcturning home he entered the house
through the pantry window, near which
his umbrella was found to-day, and ap
parently went directly to his wife's room.
Sin. Evans, awakened by the first two
phots, was heard to scream. In a moment
more, when the third shot had b*en fired,
her screams ceased, and when the hired
pirl reached her room Mrs. Evans was
dead.
Mrs. Evans, who was K years of age.
waa a society woman. Bhe was married
to Evans in 1S3S. Last Wednesday she
filed cult for divorce, alleging drunken
ness and cruelty, and at the same time
brought stilt demanding that her hus
band pay $800 for the barn occupied by
the company of which he is manager. The
property, Mrs. Evans asserted, belonged
to her, and In addition she asked an or
der restraining Evans from disposing: of
two of the horses and other property,
which she said also belonged to her. Mrs.
Evans attracted much attention, last
March Curing the teamsters' strike by
driving one of her husband's transfer
wagtsne, which the regular driver refused
to take out of the barns for fear of vio
lence at the hands of the strikers. Mrs.
"Evans madÂ© several trips, perched on thÂ©
ceat of a big truck, between her hus
band's barns and the freight houses, driv
ing fearlessly through crowds of Jeering
strikers. Once when some of the strikers
tried to cut the horses' traces she lashed
c the men with her whip and proceeded
without being further molested.
Mrs. Evans was attacked as she lay
asleep. According to the hired girl, the
only witness to the tragedy, Evans en
tered his wife's apartments at about day
light and fired two shots at her. Neither
took effect, and then dragging Mrs. Evans
toward him by the hair he deliberately
placed the revolver^ against the back of
her neck' end fired. The shot literally
blew thÂ© woman's head oft. In the dim
light thÂ© hired girl was unable to reoog
rize the murderer positively as Evans,
but Informed the police when the alarm
*m riven that she believed ehe recog-
Elzed the voice as his. Evans escaped,
sr.d his body was found only after sev
eral hours' search.

: Edwards was removed to the insane
i ward at the City Receiving. Hospital. He
; was in an extremely excited condition
i and could give no rational account of the
* affair. When asked why he committed
the act he said that something told him
to go ahead and that he had no control of
himself. At the hospital he was placed in
the straitjacket and will be brought be
fore the Insanity Commissioners. Late in
the evening his condition became worse
and he lay dazed and semi-conscious, for
getful of past life and of the tragic
events of the day.

All were then marched back to their
cells, and they went like soldiers and
The other prisoners, twelve ln number,
had awakened by this time to a realiza
tion of what was happening. They be
haved well. Instead of taking advantage
of the predicament of their keepers, they
joined in the fray and assisted in bringing
the insane man to earth and binding him
with rooes.
John Martin, another prisoner, was the
third victim. He stumbled and pitched
forward under a well delivered blow and
lay with his companions Insensible.
Guard Wendel by this time had reached
the madman. He rushed at him and Ed
wards turned upon him with the fury of
a wild beast and ewung the sledge at his
head. Wendel dodged and the handle of
the implemnt hit him on the arm. The
force was so great as to snap the oaken
handle, and the insane man beat the air
with the splintered wood, aiming a blow
at whoever come near him.
Wendel, whose right arm had been dis
abled by the blow, foupht as best ! he
couid. He had a rifle, but could not use
it. Neither could he draw his revolver.
Guard Koning drove up just at this stage
of the proceedings. He Jumped from the
seat of the wagon and took a hand in the
affair. Not wishing to kill the maniac, he
fired a shot in the air to frighten him,
then passed his pistol to Wendel, who
tired four more.
Guard Max Konlng rode on a wagon that
hauled the broken material away. All
went well until 3 o'clock in the after
noon, when Edwards' morose condition
became more marked and 1 he hammered
the heavy stones with renewed vigor.
Suddenly the prisoner turned, with the
ten-pound hammer poised in midair. "I
can't help it!" he exclaimed.' "I am
crazy." Then he swung the iron imple
ment, striking Prisoner i-ike
who was nearest to him, on the right side
of the head. Again he raised the sledge
and dealt a blow to Tom Walsh, another
prisoner, hitting him in the same place
and felling him to the ground. All the
time the maniac was exclaiming- that he
could not avoid what he was doing; that
he was crazy and an impulse drove him
on ln his deadly work.
STBIKES AT GUABD.
BENICIA. Aug. IB.â W. H. Johnston, a
district lineman employed by the Sunset
Telephone Company, met with a tragic
death this afternoon by coming in con
tact with an electric light wire. John
ston had been kept exceptionally busy
making repairs eince the linemen went
out on a strike, and it was while so en
gaged this afternoon that he met his
death.
Johnston left for Port Costa about 11
o'clock to make some slight repairs, and
was expected to be gone but a short
while. His wife, who is manager of the
telephone office at this point, became
alarmed at his absence this afternoon and
sent a party ln search .of him. The
searchers found him dead half-way be
tween Port Costa* and Crockett at the
foot of one of the poles of the Bay Coun
ties Power Company, from which he had
fallen. The telephone wires are strung on
the same poles. His body was badly
burned and evidently he met instant
death when he came ln contact with the
death-dealing current of the light wlre3.
Johnston had been ln the employ of the
Sunset Company for Beveral years and
was one of its most trusted and compe
tent men. He had resided here for five
years with his family and was highly re
spected. He leaves a wife and two chil
dren.

The wine and grape men were of one
way of thinking about the necessity of
having pure wine3 protected. Every prop

others were Introducedâ went through
without opposition or debate.

of C. L. Larue- of Yountville. Charles
Bundschu of San Francisco, Theo Gier of
Oakland, A. Fernlof St. Helena, Otto
Schluer of Woodland and W. Hansen of
San Francisco, presented the following
resolutions, which were adopted without
debate:

pure wine In the' United' States has become
detrimental to the wine Interests of this coun

Whereas. Stringent legislation Is required to
prevent a continuance of such abuse; therefore,
be It t >
Resolved, That this convention, composed of

protect the legitimate wine Industry from im
position and . fraud; and wo respectfully re
quest our representatives in Congress to take
all proper means to secure the passage of such
measure. . . , ;
Congressman Bell made one of the lead

that ereat ' Interest had been -manifested
in having pure California wines protected

An air of uneasiness pervaded the
County Clerk's office yesterday. Shortly
after 1 o'clock rumors were rife to â¢ the
effect that County Clerk Mahony was
about to dlscharce a dozen of his em
ployes for neglecting their duties and fail
ing to do certain work assigned to them a
few months ago, when Mahony, whose
term of ofBce expires next January, or
dered the men to work overtime In order
that he might leave the office with all the
records up. The rumors turned out to be
only too true, for within an hour after
the clerks heard that the ax was to fall
a fiat was Issued by the County Clerk de
claring the places of James McElroy, W.
J. Kennedy, Charles Morris, John Ahern,
Thomas Quinn, John Rellly and John Me-
Kenna vacant. The first four named are
courtroom clerks, Rellly is chief copyist
and McKonna is a copyist.
The order discharging thÂ© men had
hardly been issued when they all set
about working for a restoration. Accord-
Ing to his own statement, McKenna, who
Is a brother of Chief Justice Joseph Mc-
Kenna, was the first to be restored. He
said at 6 o'clock that he had seen Ma
hony and that "he was all right." Mor
ris said he had also had an interview
with the County Clerk and was not to go.
This left McElroy. Kennedy, Ahern,
Quinn and Reilly to be accounted for. It
in said that Mahony had granted McEl
roy and Kennedy a respite to the first of
the month, but that the three last named
must 2:0. *
Frank Burk and Dan Ward are slated
to fill two of the vacancies.

The Board of Education has a complaint
against the Board of Public Works for
the long delay of the last named body ln
preparing the plans for the completion of
the Noe Valley School building.
As far back as last March the| Board
of Education sent a communication to the
Board of Works asking that' the plans
mentioned be submitted as soon as conver
nient. The plans are far from compli
cated, Inasmuch as they are simply to
provide for the grading of the lot sur
rounding the building and the building of
a bulkhead in the rear ln order to prevent
the water from the upper land draining
under the structure.
Four months after the request of the
Board of Education was made the Board
of Works submitted the plans, which,
however, were not considered satisfac
tory, as they contemplated the building
of a bulkhead eight feet high and were
not agreeable to the Board of Education
in some other essential particulars. The
Board of Works was again communicated

property was being stowed away police

burning the bedding. It was noon by the
time the Seventh Regiment was ready to
leave. The men crossed to San Diego and
after lunch departed on a special train of
ten cars for the north. They expressed
themselves as greatly pleased with- tha
location of the encampment. They have
profited greatly by the Instruction and

year's encampment has been the best and
the most enjoyable the Seventh Regiment
has ever had. ''..."

The governments of civilized nations are now receiving the stiff and formal reports of the

Grasses are bleaghed by the fumes of
sulphur. A barrel of sufficient depth, air
tight, is used. Across the open top are
placed two sticks, from which . hang the
grasses to be bleached. The lower end
of the grasses when hanging must hang
at least ten inches from the bottom of the
barrel. On the bottom is placed a flat
stone and on that a piece of red hot iron
or a pan of hot charcoal and on either
Is distributed a quantity of powdered sul
phur. The barrel is covered with the head
and over that Is placed a piece of old
Carpet to prevent the fumes from escap

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
MUCPI is written about the deterioration of the foundation of the sentiments of life by the
progress of the artificial in civilization. But much that is written is wrong. As long as life and
death and human affection are in the world the sentiment which counts something better
than honors and wealth and society will endure and be among the master motives of men.
When all the sleepers in a Pullman were kept awake by a crying child, which its father vainly
tried to soothe by carrying it in his arms, and a rich man, accustomed to have his way and long for
getful of the gentler sentiments, angrily asked, "Where is the mother of that brat and why doesn't
she take care of it?" the father answered, "Its mother is dead and her body is in the express car."
Then the surly rich man clothed himself and left his berth, with tears running down his face, and
said, "Forgive me, if you can, but let me care for the child and you get some rest." A moment be
fore he would have scorned the suggestion thaUanything could have pierced the asbestos of selfish
ness with which years of indifference to others had armored his sentiment. But one touch of nature
had shattered it^and the fjroud man took upon him the service of another. .
Given the occasion and no wall of formality can resist the simple power of those ineffable
sentiments which endure. Not long ago Mrs. John G. Carlisle was driving in her carriage in the
crowded streets of New York, when one o! her horses was. knocked down and fatally injured. The
great lady, who had been by the side of her husband when he was,Speaker, Senator and head of the
President's Cabinet, left her and sitting in the street took the head of the wounded horse
in the lap of her silk dress, cleaned the blood and grime from its eyes and soothed it as best she
could. Nature and the softer sentiment that is with the common tie of fate and life, which make
us mindful even'of the sufferings of the beasts that perish, instead of being destroyed by civilization
or replaced by the artificial and frivolous, are as strong and imperative as ever.
Recently a father in New York had flashed to him the message that his young daughter had
sought the restorative climate of California, too late t^ cure her illness and that death was near. V In
a special train he began the long race with death across the continent that he might see his child once
more alive. Every track, train and yard man on the railroads he used knew the cause of his rapid
journey, and each was at his post, lest time lost in switching or coupling might prevent that last meet
ing of father and child, and as his train flew by the plainest people, gentle and simple, all raised their
hats or bowed their heads in respectful, salute to that father in whose love for his child all the world
In Chicago ten days ago the body of a drowned man washed ashore and was recognized by
th^police as that of a burglar. His family in the East? was wired to know if he should" be buried in
poner's field or would they receive his dust. They refused. Then a woman, certified as of good
character, came forward, simply saying, "I knew him. I loved him. I did not, know he was a
burglar. He was good to me. I will bury him." The stain on his life, the tragedy of his death,
counted for naught against nature sentiment. "He was good to me. I will bury him"; though
it carried for her suspicions, unenviable notoriety and a train of consequences from which even men
shrink, all was brushed away. Nature had touched the" affluent fountain of human sentiment. The
silent tongue could not thank her. The water- worn body knew not the cerements that clothed it,
nor the earth in which jt rested. But it had sepulture, and the pleadings of a faithful spirit
that the sins ayd errorsjnight be forgiven and the distorted life be transformed where all tears are
wiped away. ."â¢-'" , â¢ Â¦ â¢ Â¦ '. â¢ . * V

A German inventor has designed a foot

the springs for raising the foot usually
found In such devices are avoided. The
support is thus- steady and solid, even
when the person is at rest. The driving
wheel is located under the center of pres

Two spring pawls are secured to an ex

to slide by the same when drawn upward.
The chain is thus driven forward posi

AUTOMOBILE chairs propelled. by
electricity will be used at the
World's Fair at St. Louis next
year. A concession was recently
granted by the exposition to a
St. Louis company, giving them the right
to operate the; new style chairs within
the World's Fair grounds. The chair is
the invention of Semple S. Scott and is
the result of nearly three years' experi
menting and designing.
It Is said that the machine has a uni
form speed of three" miles an hour, which
is exactly the same running up or down
a steep grade or on a level. The occu
pant has no control over this speed what
ever. The simplicity of operation is such
that anv one can readily run It. The
most desirable feature is the. fact that
the machine is provided with a sensitive,
guard rail. The latter is deemed the
most valuable invention on the machine.
If the machine collides with any object
or person a pressure of only a few ounces
pushes this guard rail back and causes
the wheel3 to become locked, thus bring
ing the chair to a dead standstill before
the machine itself strikes the object or
Each chair will carry two passengers,
one of whom may operate the machine,
or, if desired, an operator will be fur
nished, who will not^only run the ma
chine but will also serve as a guide td
explain all the points of interest. The
operator sits on a detachable seat at the
rear of the chair, from which point he
controls the machine, the controller and
steering bar being removed from the- front
and attached to sockets in the rear.
The report for 1902 to the United States
Geological Survey on the production of
platinum In 190i. now in press, is in two
parts the first being the report proper,
by Dr. Joseph Struthers. and the second
a paper by Professor J. F. Kemp on plat
inum in the Rambler mine, Wyoming.
The production of platinum from do
mestic ores in the United States decreased
from IMS ounces, valued at J27.52S. in 1901
âthe largest output recorded by the Geo
logical Survey since 18S0â to 94 ounces,
valued at $1814. the smallest production
since 1S9.1. In connection with the plati
num there were also obtained from the
ores 20 fine ounces of iridium; as against
233 ounces in 1901. The domestic supply
of platjnum in recent years has been ob
tained as a secondary product chiefly from
gold placer deposits in Trinity and Shasta
counties. California. It is reported that
the metal occurs, though not in commer
cially rich deposits, in many other gold
placer>-of California, as well as in Wash
ington, Oregon. Idaho, Montana.' Colo
rado and Alaska. The Rambler mine,
"Wyoming, continues to attract attention,

who, from the retired manner of his life,
was not sufficiently acquainted with pub

John Lane's mysterious manuscript in
a red box, discovered by him, now that
the book Is published. Is creating a con
siderable amount of interest.

solved immediately the book was pub

Â¦would be sure then to reveal himselfâ
tv hen the book^was found to be a success,
â¢which It undoubtedly isâ but no, he re
mains silent on the subject.
The reason for the curious title of the
book Is Interesting, too. Mr. Lane did not
know what to call It. It- seems that Mrs.
â¢W. K. Clifford. Henry Harland, W. J.
Locke, Professor Yorke Powell and others
wrote, almost Eimultaneously, suggesting
that as the manuscript was found in the
publisher's red box it should be entitled
"The Manuscript in the Red Box." As

CALIFORNIA cannot expect that her welcome to the Grand Army will surpass in spon
taneity," hospitality or fervor the welcome given in any other State where the Grand En
campment has been Tield. The love felt for the veterans and the honor in which they are
held are the outcome of true Americanism and are found among all classes of our people
wherever and whenever # the veterans assemble. We may exceed other cities in the splendor of our
decorations and in 7 the extent and variety of entertainments provided, but the welcome .itself will be
no more nor less than that whicK is universal in the Union which their valor preserved from dis-
No oth'er army has ever received the popular honors bestowed upon this and no other army
ever so well deserved it. The veterans represent.the flower of the heroic age of the republic. Al
ready romance and tradition have begun to infuse that period of our history with the bright colors of
poetic imagination, and as the years pass it will become more and more the theme of novelists and
poets. The deeds of the veterans-will be enhanced by every charm that literature can add to them,
and yet nothing that* imagination can devise or art accomplish will ever equal the reality of that
stirring time when from all the homes in tlie land the young men hurried forth at their country's
call to fight the great battles that rid the land of slavery and our politics of the doctrines of secession.
What is now felt as an enthusiasm was then felt as a passionate patriotism that amounted to a relig
ion,''and the influences of that passion remain with us to-day and will be made manifest in all,the
popular greetings with which the Grand Army will be received.
/ While we do not expect to exceed the hospitality of other States in welcoming the veterans,
we shall have the satisfaction of receiving them under fairer conditions than are to be found else
where. They have come to the most generous spot in all this chivalrous land ; they will find here
more geniality of earth and f sky, more natural beauty, more abundant prosperity and more general
enjoyment than are to be found among the dwellers on any other part of the globe. Here they will
feel none of the sweltering heats that make the dog days of the East well nigh unbearable, nor will
they have to undergo any of the discomforts that harass large assemblies fn Eastern cities during any
of the summer months. The exhilaration of the ocean breeze will help us to make our reception
thoroughly enjoyable to all who come, while tlie profusion of fruits and flowers will go far toward
giving our hospitality a cnarm that can be found nowhere else. ;' . :
It will be worth while for even the busiest of the visitors to give some time during the en
campment to a study of the resources and industries of the. State. It is through their valor that Cal
ifornia is a part of a republic extending from ocean to ocean, and however great may be the demands
of the encampment upon them, not one of them should return home without having learned much of
the wonderful State to whfch they have come. Thanks to the work done by the California Promo
tion Committee ample information is available to all who desire it, and it can be obtained under con
ditions that make its acquirement not a task, but a pleasure.
California's population is composed in well nigh equal parts of men from every section of the
country east of the Mississippi. Men from east and west and north and south have made their
homes here and helped in the upbuilding of the State. Our population is therefore more compre
hensively American than that of any other single State; no sectional feelings exist among us; it is as
an American people that we welcome the army and extend to the veterans the best that we have of
The wearing away of the strength of the organization; the diminution of its numbers, has
now become a familiaj; thoiightfin the public mind, and the sentiment of patriotic regard is mingled
with that arising from the consciousness that within a few years the veterans will be no longer strong
enough to make journeys across the continent and hold grand encampments on the Pacific Coast. So
it is with a deep and tender feeling of love, 'as well as of patriotic loyalty, that we welcome them now
and offer them all that is ours. - '*'

SAN DIEGO, Aug. IS.-District Attor
ney Carter to-day filed a complaint
against County Assessor Rush and his
bondsmen, Jacob Gruendlke and Richard
O'Neil, charging the Assessor with col
lecting personal property taxes in, cases
where the real estate was sufficient tp
cover any lien which might be levied for
the collection of such taxes, this. It being
claimed, being contrary to law. The Dis
trict Attorney alleges that Rush has il
legally retained the 6 per cent commis
sion for collecting and that the county
has lost money, his complaint alleging
that the Assessor held out the inducement
that if persons would pay to him this
money they would escape the tax .for the
eupport of the schools. It is charged that
the Assessor retained as his 6 per cent of
these collections $363 25, and that taxpay
ers avoided the tax for school and edu-
rational purposes in the sum of $2733. Suit
Is brought to recover from the bondsmen
J37C2 S3. The County Assessor states that
he is given by law discretionary power to
rcake the assessments levied by him.
Speci&l Dispatch to The Call
REDWOOD CITY, Aug. 15.â The parti
tion suit brought by A. S. Baldwin
against the Regents of the University of
California was up for hearing to-day be
fore Judge Buck on the referees' report.
The land which it is desired to partition
corsists of some 25W acres, situated near
Menlo Park, being lands formerly owned
by Miss Jennie Flood and by her deeded
to the Regents of the university. The
property is now owned by Baldwin and
the Regents ln equal . shares.
The referees appointed by the court to
make a division of the land gave to Bald
win 1326 acres and to the Regents 11&3
acres. They found that the value of the
property given by them to Baldwin is
worth 514.216 22 more than that set apart
for the Regents and they ordered that
the plaintiff pay to the defendants the
sum of J710S 16. \ Â¦
The Regents are dissatisfied with the di
vision as made by the referees and desire
to exchange tracts. They claim that they
should be permitted to bid upon the
tracts. A bid of $10,000 was made by them
to-day for first choice and the money de
posited in court. It is stated that the
Regents are willing to bid even higher.
The hearing was continued to a futur*
day.
BUENA VISTA, Colo., Aug 15.-At 10:30
o'clock last night Denver and Rio Grande
passenger train No. 1, which left Denver
at 9:30 a. m., went through a bridge near
Nathrop, eight miles east of here, caus
ing the injury of fourteen passengers.
The most seriously injured:
Mrs. Hopkins, Albion, Ohio, bad cut
left eye and internal Injuries; Mrs. Lath
er, Pittsburg, face badly cut, slight in
ternal injuries; Mrs. G. K. Knapp, Mil
waukee, sprained knee, badly lacerated

Smith, Muscatine, Iowa, injuries about
body; B. O. Brown, New York City, bad
ly sprained knee; R. O. Pavllla, Wash
ington, right arm badly Injured.
The wreck occurred on a bridge weak
ened by the flood, which last night was
almost a cloudburst. The flr3t engine of
the double header passed the bridge and
the second got over excepting the tender.
Thfe baggage car went through and was
smashed to kindling.- The baggageman
Jumped and was not injured. The smok
er and chair car were turned partly over.
The passengers injured were mostly in
the tourist sleeper that was. turned on its
side in the ravine. The dining' car and
two sleepers remained on the track and
the diner was converted into a hospital
car.. Â¦ i .
A wrecking train with a number of phy
sicians was hurried from Buena Vista at
ll;30 o'clock, and it was not until 3:15
this morning thsft the injured were
brought here. That many were, not killed
outright was marvelous.
On the Colorado and Southern near
Schwanders, six miles west of here, a
wreck was reported at 3 o'clock this
morning. The engineer and fireman are
reported seriously injured. Further de
tails have not been received.
The passengers who were badly injured
were removed to-day to the hospital at
Salida, Colo. Five of them are reported
to be in a serious condition. They are:
Mrs. Hopkins, Albion, Ohio; Mrs. H. L.
Lather, ' Pittsburg, Kans. ; Mr. and Mrs.
R. J. Kapp, Milwaukee, and John D.
Smith, Muscatine, Iowa.
NEW YORK. Aug. 15.â Operations ln to
day's stock market were made up large
ly of professional trading. The profes
sionals were inclined' to work for a re
actlon. owing to the rapidity of the week's
recovery in the market, which might be
assumed at once to have been of a vul
nerable character on the long side of the
market. London evidently took a gloomy
view of the situation and had made in
roads on last night's prices before the
opening here. The. selling by the arbi
trage operators quickly carried prices
down to the London level. There was
also free profit taking in Amalgamated
Copper. After the London selling was
completed there. was a pause, and then
a vigorous recovery which retrieved prac
tically, all the prices. This was appar
ently ln anticipation of a favorable bank
statement/ Tho statement did not meet
this expectation.
The loan contraction in view qÂ£_ the

YOUNGEST SURVIVING VET
ERAN OF CIVIL WAR, NOW
IN CITY. . Â«
CAPTAIN EUGENE MERRICK.
who arrived yesterday in company
â¢with General Black, has the hon
or of being the 'youngest surviv-
ing veteran of the Civil War.
He enlisted at Camp Fry v in Chicago,
February. 1, 1865, when he was Just 12
years of age. Badly as soldiers were
wanted about that time th'e youngster
found considerable difficulty in finding a
recruiting officer to accept him, but after
repeated failures he found an old fam
ily friend, who took him into his own
regiment.
Merrick's boyhood days were passed
near Yorkville, Kendal County, 111. His
two brothers enlisted and the little fellow
contracted the war fever in violent form.
He presented himself to the mustering
officer, who told him he was too young
and tender to stop rebel bullets and ad
vised him to go home and grow older.
Five times the youngster was turned
down. In desperation and still undaunt
ed he left home and proceeded to Chicago.
He found at camp Fry an old friend of.
the family, Captain Frank A. Buys, com
manding Company C of the One* Hundred
and Forty-seventh Illinois, and on Febru
ary 1. 1865, the. name of Eugene Merrick
was added to the company roll.
Merrick enlisted as a soldier and for
two weeks shouldered a musket and did
what he could to master the drills and
duties of his new profession. At the end
of that time Captain Buys, fearing a rep
rimand for having enlisted so tender a
youth, made Merrick a drummer. The
regiment, which was organized under the
third call, was ordered to the front, but
did not see much hard service, being with
Sherman in the fag end of the Georgia
campaign.
Merrick likes nothing better than to re
call his boyish experiences during that
grim time. His martial spirit was consid
erably dampened, he confesses, the first
time he found himself under fire. His
pride held him to the task he had under
taken, however, and he stuck It out to the
end. He was mustered out January 20,
1S6G, at Camp Butler.
Captain Merrick "has always been ready
to serve his country in its hour of need.
During times of peace he does his duty
as a good citizen. When the late war
with Spain was declared Merrick again
volunteered under the Stars and Stripes.
He enlisted and received a commission'
as captain of volunteers. Through no
fault of htjt own he took no active part ln
the campaign, his regiment getting no
nearer the front than Key West.
When Captain Merrick enlisted in 1S65
he promised a wbmaiv who took great in
terest in the .little soldier that he would
neither smoke nor use tobacco. He has
abided by that boyish pledge throughout
his life. He is a convincing speaker and
occasionally takes the stump in the in
terest of 'good citizenship.

ant surprise, but the -sentiment of the
market seemed more' influenced by the
loss of cash where a considerable gain
had been hoped for. The market sold
off again to about the lowest, with net
losses of a point or more for some of
the principal active stocks. The down
ward course of the stock market termin
ated for the present with the plunge of
last Saturday and prices have rebounded
with some violence this week. It waanot'
without the air of some forcible measures
in the way of support for the market by
large buying coders and by a relaxation
of the pressure for .liquidation of loans
that the decline was arrested. Monday
morning saw an ingathering of influen
tial men in the financial world recalled
from various quarters by Saturday's
events and it is commonly supposed that
the results of Monday were the result
to an extent of concerted measures among
bankers and capitalists. The mere fact
of the arrest of the declines had the
effect of lightening the selling pressure
upon the market caused by the destruc
tion of margins and the constant shrink
age of collateral. There was some fur
ther, selling of collateral out of loans
early ln the week, causing a continuance
of some of last week's rumors of finan
cial difficulties overhanging the market,
but the absorption of stocks was of a
much more confident and determined char
acter than for a long time.'
Liquidation of a very large foreign In
debtedness has been an important ele
ment in the weakness' of stocks, "as""in
dicated by. the high level maintained by
domestic bank loans by reborrowins for
payment of forelen loans.
Of more immediate consequence ln Wall
street were thÂ« increased dividend rate
on Canadian Pacific from five to a six
point -basis and the representation of St.
Lrfmis and San Francisco interests ln the
Seaboard Air Line directory. The latter
particularly was .of a stimulating: effect
upon the market, 1 as indicating the pos
sibility of new developments in commun
ity of interests as an outcome of the ex
tensive sales of shares in various repre
sentations, v

NEW YORK, Aug. 15.â The Financier
this week says:
The dlsappolntlns features 8ho*n by the
ofndal statement of the New York Associated
Banks were the decrease Instead of the qutte
confidently expected increase in loans, and the
loss in cash reserve Instead of an Important
gain which was foreshadowed by the prelim
inary estimates, which were based upon, the
traceable movements of money during: the
W ?he cash reserve decreased $2,257,800. while
the estimates called for an Increase of $3,442,
700 The Joans decreased $1.351.500,. which. *um,
added to the loss of cash, would make $5,509,
.".00 less deposits. This item, however, de
creased $3,647,200. or $2,327.900 . more than
the total decrease of loans and of cash; hence,
the statement dl<t .not balance. The required
reserve was diminlnhed $2.2.14,300 through the
decrease in deposits, so' deducting this sum
from the above noted- loss of canh leaves the
almost insignificant reduction of $2.1.500 ln sur
plus reserve to $21,563,575. This slight change

PERSONAL MENTION.
At 10 o'clock last night the people re
siding in the vicinity of O'Farrell and
Laguna streets were startled by the re
port of a gun emanating from some one
of the large apartment houses In that
neighborhood. Many rushed into the
street to inquire the source of the shot,
but no one seemed able to solve the
mystery. As inquiry after Inquiry failed
to bring forth the origin . of the dis
turbance, nerves became more tense
and visions of Red Shirt Gordons and
other things began to appear, and there
were hysterical apprenensions of get
ting the other barrel.
,The police finally made an Inspection
of the apartment house situated on the
southeast corner of Laguna and O'Far
rell streets, and in a room on the top
floor solved the mystery. A young man
'resident of the house had been offering
entertainment to another young man
friend of his who gave the name of A.
Von Dulm.
Just what the exact nature of the
entertainment was, was not learned,
further than that, from Von Dulm's
statement, after refreshments had
been served the young men proceeded to
make an inspection of a gun which they
had secured for - the purpose of 'going
hunting in Oakland.." and that in exam
ining the weapon to see that it was
properly loaded to protect them from
the big game that abounds in that wild
suburb the piece went off. The police
evidently thought the hunters were jus
tified in taking every safeguard, and. re
gretting the accident, left without mak
ing any arrest.

and 1903 giving the police power to search
junk shops for stamped bottles used for
ale, beer, soda water, etc. The decision
was rendered in a suit for a writ of pro
hibition brought by a junk dealer to pre

his trial on a charge of having bottles
belonging to others in his possession. The
writ was granted.

On April 10 last the bottlers of this

While -Judge C.onlan was hearing the case
the junk dealers, through their counsel,
sued out a writ of prohibition before Su
perior Judge Seawell, contending that the
act permitting a search warrant was un
constitutional, as being In violation of
the ' California constitution; that : search
warrants should be confined to cases of

the sounds of battle are heard outside
and the Christian ' troops break through

TUNGLINGS AEE COMING.
-On or about- June Sand-June^lB barges
containing: 4972 sacks of wheat belonging
to the Eppingers. intended for Crockett,
were shifted over, to the McNear ware
house - and ! placed- to the credit â¢ of ; the
American National Bank. This latter
deal was, reported to have been made to
satisfy Mr.- Bowles, when he suddenly as
certained that there was no wheat in the
Crockett warehouse to secure " his bank
for advances, he had Just made on wheat
In that warehouse, which was supposed
by him to have been delivered there only
a few days previous to the failure*-
"While the barge was lying alongside
the i Crockett i warehouse, it Is alleged,
parties â¢representing the American Na;
tronal Bank caused this same barge tobe
loaded ; with grain to her fullest capacity
and : were in the acf of taking it away
when the receiver appeared and forced the
banking contingent to put back all the
grain on the "dock, ' excepting the 1100
sacks that A had originally . been- on --the
barge. On . June V 9 the steamer. San Joa^
quin No,- 2' removed'the 1100 -sacks from
the Alabama and took them away, no one
seems to know where. Â¦ Â¦';... . â¢Â¦ ;
It is alleged that on June 3 there were
shipped on the barge Alabama from. Mon
roeville warehouse 6317 sacks of wheat,
consigned to Eppinger & Co., for Crockett
warehouse. And it is alleged that while
this shipment was en route Mr. Â¦ Bowles
of the American National. Bank' began ; to
press the Eppingers, for an accounting.
To temporarily^ arrest any proceedings on
his part they agreed to divert the course
of the . barge" Alabama and her load of
wheat..from: the- Crockett warehouse and
deliver the same to the -keeping of Mr.'
Bowles. â¢ At" this very instant, however,
the other creditors came in and forced an
issue^. but for* some reason- known only
to the Eppinger ; company they issued or
ders to have, the barge proceed to- the
McNear warehouse at Port Costa and de
liver the^ wheat to Mr. Bowles. Here all
but 1100. 'sacks were unloaded, this latter
amount being tien sent over to the
Crockett" 1 warehouse. "
The mysterious and extraordinary inls
doings'-of the EppingÂ«r contlngrent Btill
come to light. The bankers interested In
the failure of 1 thÂ©* grain firm have dig
covered another one "of their "cute"
dodges.' This Is In the shape of the hand

An interesting Incident occurred yes
terday afternoon just after General Black
registered at the Palace. Comrade
French, a resident of this State, intro
duced himself to General Black. French's
brother was standard-bearer for General
Black's regiment in the war. He was a
man of gigantic proportions, being 7tfeet 1
inch In height. French had a map of .the
battle of Pea Ridge in his pocket and the
two old soldiers with great delight sat
down and scanned the map and pointed
out to each other "where the fiercest en

MEETS OLD COMRADE.
General Black is at present a resident of
Chicago, where he is a practicing attor
ney. He enlisted as a private in April,
1S61. and after four years and four
months of service retired as , colonel, of
the Thirty-seventh Illinois Regiment. He
has also been made a brigadier general.
Six years ago he held the office of de
partment commander of the Illinois De
partment of the Grand Army of the Re
public.
The general is accompanied by his wife
and pretty daughter. Miss Helen Black.
Among those in General Black's party
registered at the Palace are General Ben
son Wood, General James Everest, Ad
jutant General Partridge and Colonel
Thomas G. Lawlor.
Until the first of this month General Black
was recorded as the only candidate. In their
recent gatherings the departments of Illinois,
Indiana.. Michigan. Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Iowa. Missouri. Nebraska, Virginia. New York
and Arkansas have all adopted resolutions
pledging- their representatives to General
Black's svrport.
MANY INDORSEMENTS.
Adjutant General Partridge, who is a
member of the Illinois contingent, in dis
cussing General Black's candidacy, said:
SILENT AS TO CANDIDACY.
"^'I^would be Indelicate for me to dis
cuss my candidacy now," he eald yester
day afternoon. Ask me about anything
else and I will gladly talk."
"Well, general, it is still rumored that
General Miles will allow his name to be
presented at the coming encampment; if
such Is the case would you withdraw your
name?" the interviewer persisted.
"That Js hardly a fair question to ask
me." replied General Black. "I will say,
though, that General Miles is a close
friend of mine and I consider him a great
soldier. I am a great admirer of him."
.The question of General Black's name
being withdrawn In favor of General
Miles brought out a storm of disapproval
on the part of a number of members of
the Illinois delegation who were clustered
round their candidate. "No, no," they
remarked, "we won't withdraw his name
for any one."
the Palace Hotel he was warmly greeted
by members of the Grand Army from all
parts of the Union. "How are you, gen
eral? You can count on many friends in
our post." was the welcome he received
on every side as he shook hands with old
comrades in the hotel corridors.
The presence of mind Dorabierer dis
played saved the house from being burned,
a? the Canes from the dying woman's
<iress had already ignited a portion of
the wall of the room. As soon as Dorn
bierer saw that his wife was dead he
turned his attention to the house and
taw that the f.ames were already creep-
Ing up on the walls. He secured a bucket
of water and finally managed to put out
the blaze, though If he had waited a mo
ment longer the house would in all prob
ability have been in flames and beyond
salvation.
The police at the South San Francisco
station were notified and Officers McSor-
Ipy and Gordon went at once to the scene
of the accident. After a thorough in
vestigation they came to the conclusion
that thÂ« woman met her death in ex
actly the manner described by her hus
band.
The Coroner's deputies went to the scene
of the burning later in the evening and
brought the body to the Morgue, where
It now lies.

The gathering yesterday was wholly in
formal. John Hlnkle was chosen to pre
side and' Attorney O. P. Stidger was se
lected to serve as temporary secretary.
After the meeting had been opened the
last named gentleman explained the sit
uation to the assembled stockholders and
then an Interesting and at times heated
discussion began.
All of the stockholders seemed con
vinced finally that there was something
wrong with the wells, at least, and the
general opinion was that there should ba
an Investigation. It was agreed that there
should be a committee of three stock
holders to perform the work. "Wormser
held that there should be an expert em
ployed and the others at last agreed to

Company would stand good for the ex
pense Incurred.
This communication was sent to H. C.
Miller. The news spread abroad quickly.
It was resolved that something should be
done, and yesterday's Impromptu meeting
was the outcome.
The stock dropped to $1 63 and there was
a general awakening.' Some laughed in
their sleeves and bought more -stock; oth
ers sold rapidly. Many stockholders be
came apprehensive lest all might not be
as It should, but their fears took no defi
nite shape.
Then one day came a letter from one
of the Home Oil Company's drillers. He
said that he did not wish to disclose his
identity, but that he felt it right for the
investors to know that the wells were
producing great quantities of water but
comparatively little oil.
LETTER CREATES EXCTTEifENT.
Forty disturbed and apprehensive stock
holders In the Home Oil Company met at
the exchange rooms in the Mills building
yesterday afternoon for the purpose of.
making some head or tall out of the
strange rumors which have been flying
about for a week concerning the status
of their Investments.
After much heated discussion and many
veiled accusations against U. B. Ellis, pres
ident of the company, the meeting ter
minated with the appointment of a com
mittee of investigation.
The Home OH Company Is one of the
oldest organizations of Its kind In tha
State. It has proved an excellent invest
ment for the greater part of the stock
holders, and has ranked always as a per
fectly straight concern. Many of the most
cautious business men of California are
Investors in the Home Oil Company, and
the present difficulty comes as a complete
surprise to speculative San Francisco.
President Ellis wju aware that the storm
was coming, but left nevertheless this
week for Wyoming,, where he claims to
have a considerable amount of oil prop
erty. None of the other four directors
were present yesterday.
The Home Oil Company's real estate
holdings are at Coallnga. Hanford is the
shipping point. .The property is of con
siderable extent and eight wells have
been drilled. The company was formed
in the early part of 1897. during the first
of the oil excitement. Ellis, who is but
little more than 30 years old. appeared In
the oil region and after some investiga
tion purchased Home Oil at 13 cents a
share. The par value is $1.
COMPANY PBOSPEBS AT ITBST.
The stock went up by leaps and bounds
and has at times nearly toudhed the $1
mark. Last week it was at $3 10. The output
has until recently been approximately 700
barrels a day. A month since the Stand
ard Oil Company contracted with the
Home Oil people for 13,000 barrels month
ly for five years at the fixed rate of 63
cents a barrel. Previously the company
had made money by selling oil at 33 cents
a barrel. The publication of the fact that
a contract had been made on such good
terms boomed the stock, and the investors
were kept busy for a few days congratu
lating themselves and each other.
President Ellis In July held 2S.00O of tha
100.000 shares of stock of the Home Oil
Company. Quietly, but with haste, ha
sold. His transactions were conducted
through "Wilfred Page, a broker on the
exchange. Most of the investors who
paid any attention to the subsequent fall
In the price of stock concluded that some
bear was trying to make a clean-up, and.
convinced that Home Oil was one of tha
best things in the market, did not become
alarmed.

remarkable game again to-day, and -up; to.; yie
eighth inning had allowed; only 'two scattered
hits. In the eighth Inning" three . scratch hits
were made, but none of them were- costly, as Is
shown by the fact that only . one run . was
scored. Seven errors marred the' play of-tha
LÂ«os Angelea team and several ol' these; are
traceable to the fact that Captain Dillon was

Tommy Leahy was back in the game
once more after an absence of three
weeks. He was" hailed with delight by the
crowd. Tommy, played a great game' and
was the only, man on the- team who con
nected wfth the offerings of Cooper for
more than one safe hit. "The score: Â»â¢ â¢
Messerly created a sensation in the first
inning when he caught-a' liner which Ir
wln aimed right over the first bag. Mes
serly whipped the sphere to Francks in
a twinkling and doubled up Shay at sec
ond. Four other lightning doubles were
afterward^executed 'and!Â«yiery one of them
shut off runs." Pj â¢ 'Â¦ :
Young Smith showed another burst of
speed at the bat in the eighth, when with
two under the bench, the kid hit to deep
left for three bases. Cooper was there
again with his third safe bingle, which
brought Smith in with the last tally of
the Kame.
In the second inning, with two gone,
L-indsey dropped a little pop fly from the
bat of " Messerly. Krug performed the
same trick .when Smith hit the ball -to
center.- Then Cooper came through with
a drive to right and the Cripples got their
first tally. They became exceedingly, fa
miliar with the goods of Mr. Lindsey in
the third spasm and three hits, aided by
an error or. so, put as m^ny as thfee
more runs in.
Cooper made the natives look like, a
bunch of tramps in every inning. His
superb backing up did the rest.Â» Not a
chance did Uncle's followers have- of
crossing the pan with runs. None of them
could hit the southpaw's offerings to any
extent and as his control was good and
only one error was made behind him, but
few of the locals ever got on the bags'. at
all. ' ' r-
'Twas a sad sight Indeed to take a look
at Uncle's collection of prize winners-; as
they vainly strove to grot home yesterday
afternoon at Recreation Park. Not only,
were they lacking in ability with the club,
but in their efforts to quiet the Cripples
from Oakland they farÂ§d badly in many
Instances and so the tall enders landed
with a total of five. Score, 5 to 0. -
Â¦ The game, although badly played
spots, had the genuine baseball ring to
it and gome of the most brilliant plays! of
the season were pulled off. Five double
plays were scattered through the nine in
nings of action, j Every one was fast and
provoked round after round of applause
from the large army of fans. v

Sullivan is looking well and is behaving
himself. â¢ He says he is going to save
money enough to buy a little farm and
settle down.
"Well, he's just as good, anyhow. I
don't know whether he would be able to
go a fijsrht like thpt which I put up
against Ryan or.KJlrain. Fighting to-day
is play .business compared with what it
was when I held the belt. Kid gloves or
bare kr.uckles would drive a good many
of the fighters of to-day to the woods."
MAHANOY CITY. Pa.. Aug. 15.â "I told
you* so," said John L. Sullivan.- who um
pired two games of- ball here to-day and
got $100 for the job. When asked what
he thought of the _*C6rbett-Jeff ries flght
he saidy
'""Oorbett should not have got even a
lrÂ»ok in, and he didn't. Jeffries Is a great
tighter. He has strength and lots of sci
ence, and can make any lighter In the
world look like 30 cents. I think Corbett
is not as fast or good a man as he was
when he fought me. He is not necrly as
clever, and. he lacks that j-outhful confi

I'll you. boy, I was a big proposition in
those days."

was in his prime. The Taig ex-champion

CRIPPLES TURN
ANOTHER TRICK
GREER DEFEATS
OARSMAN TITUS
The same tactics which killed the game
in New York are being used here. They
culminated in Friday night's affair. . The
fight was advertised throughout the coun
try and attracted many visitors from the
North, South and East. When these peo
ple arrived here they found that a few
bours after the seats were placed -on sale
all the choice ones were reported sold.
As a matter of fact, they were not sold
outright, but were placed in the hands of
peddlers, who hawked them about.
The prices, already high enough for
3uoh an affair, at once went soaring sky
ward. Twenty-dollar seats were held at
$30 and cheaper ones in proportion. Few
persons who attended the flght paid wnat
the face of their ticket called for, but
were forced to pay a premium if they de
sired a gopd seat.
â¢ The city officials are determined ... to
make an example of the scalpers who
fell into the clutches of the law on the
night of the fight. Two of .the men who
preyed upon the public by selling tickets
at exorbitant figures appeared in the Po
lice Courts yesterday. Each was charged
with violating the license ordinance in
selling tickets without Jiavlng a license.
James Glenroy, who was arrested in
Harry Corbett's saloon on Ellis street on
Friday afternoon by Deputy Tax Collec
tor- H. C. Warren, was arraigned in Po
lice Judge Cabaniss' court. When the
ca.=e was called Glenroy askc-d for a con
tinuance until next Thursday, vrhlch the
Judge granted.
Jacob Baumgarten, who was arrested
by Detective Freel outside Harry Cor
bett's saloon on Friday evening appeared
in Police Judge Conlan's court. He also
asked for a continuance through his at
torney and the case was Eet for trial next
Wednesday. Glenroy is out on $400 cash
bail. Baumgarten is out on $1000 bonds;
Mr. Coffroth leads a veritable Dr.
Jekyl and Mr. Hyde existence. In the
daytime he occupies the honorable' posi
tion of secretary of the Superior Judges,
with offices in the City Hall. At night he
is the associate of prizefighters, with his
office in the back room of some saloon in
the, purlieus of the city. ,.Â£.-, .
Ho learned the art of promoting prize
fights from Jim Kennedy of New York.
The latter Is the man who killed the sport
in New York and who has put a blight
on every sport he ever touched. Jobbery
of the lowest kind was practiced in the
East until affairs reached such a pass
that decent citizens stepped in and called
a halt. Boxing was bo thoroughly crushed
out that two amateurs cannot put on the
gloves in an exhibition match In New
York State.
Public indignrftion is running high in
the matter. 'A number of citizens have
determined to appear before the Super
visors' Police Committee' to ask the mem
bers to refuse the Yosemlte Club another
permit .The burden of the blame rests .on

and custodian of the tickets.

CLOSE CONTESTS
AT VALEJO MEET
With the champion were Jack Bellis
of Kansas City, Sam Kuqua of Carroll,
Ohio. Commodore Berry of Fresno, CharÂ«
He Merrill of Los Angeles, John Marco
vich, Eugene Van Court, Billy Â¦ Delaney,
Jack Jeffries and Charlie Jeffries.
After dining "Jeff" left the party and
went to the hotel and retired. He awoke
late to-day and went to San -Francisqo
about 2 o'clock. '
Billy Delaney, when asked about the
"future plans of the.Â»champlon, said:
."It lsÂ» difficult to say what Jeff will
decide lr> do,* for. he never tells any one
about hffe plans until he 'is ready to carry
them out, but he intends to leave Oak
land on Monday or Tuesday to' go on a
hunting expedition. He will bo accom
panied by Tom O'Brien of BakerEfleid and
a number of sports from the Â¦ southern
part of the State." v
OAKLAND. Aug. 15.â After "Jim"
Jeffries left the Mechanics' Pavilion last
night he came direct to Oakland and
went to a local restaurant, where he had
orderjed the biggest watermelon that
could be found in the city put on ice to
await his return.

Corbett will leave for St. Louis early
next week to fill an engagement in a
vaudeville house. He received a wire
from the manager, J. D. Hopkins, which
read: '"Old pard. you are more popular
than ever in St. Louis. Have you billed
like a circus for August 30." All'jyour
Highland friends send regards." ..- s
Corbett by mistake opened a telegram
for Jeffries. It was congratulating him
on the outcome of the battle., v Coibett
could not understand It- until he noticed
Jeffries' name. â¢ v . \J i >'â¢â¢''
Discussing previous fights, he said:
. ','Joe Choynski struck me the hardest
blow I- ever received. I was chasing^hlm
along the roues in our flght at Wood
ward's Pavilion, when he suddenly turned
on 'me. He let go his right and I thought
my head left my body. The blow dazed
me, but I recovered quickly. That was
the closest call I ever had in the ring."
Jeffries .apparently attaches but little
value to his title. , "I am not proud of
being the champion fighter of the world,"
he said yesterday. "It means nothing to
me except that I make my liTlng out
of the game. If I could call myself the
champion fisherman of the world or the
champion deer hunter, that would be
something of which to be proud."
He was about town yesterday; afternoon
with Joe Eagan and Eugene Van Court.
His right eye bore a blackened appear
ance t which," however, was not adminis
tered to it in the ring. Jeffries was one
of a. jolly crowd which returned to Oak
land after .the flght. : When they reached
Oakland Jeffries and Cal Ewlngr were sky
larking and the champion fell. His eye
came in contact with the curb and -he
saw more stars than he saw in Mechanics'
Pavilion.
Jeffries met Corbett in Harry Corbett's
during the afternoon and they discussed
the previous night's contest in a. friendly
manner. Corbett's body was still sore
from the terrible battering he received:
Wherever Jeffries' touched him it left a
bruise. Corbett â¢acknowledged that the
blow he received in the second round took
all the fight out of him. He knew" then
what the outcome would be and sailed in
to^make as good a showing as he could
while hia strersth lasted.
"You can whip any two men in the
business." was the compliment Corbett
paid Jeffries. He also said the champion
could have whipped Sullivan . in two
rounds at any stage of the latter's ca
reer. >' . â¢ ' Â» \l
â¢ Corbett " had an eye to the future" and
suggested that if they met in the East
they could, make some big money in ex
hibition bouts.
The outcome of the fight justifies Jef
fries' methods of training. He did com
paratively little gymnasium work, but
went into the open air and built up his
nealth. .When.he had done this he had
acquired condition which means health.
Eugene Van Court says in the past Jef
fries has trained as though he were pre
paring to ride a horse in a race and had
to get off a lot of flesh. Thi3 time ho
did not trouble about his weight and was
much more amiable during his training.

. Miss Alice M. Smith, of Minneapolis,
Minn., tells how woman's monthly suffering
may be quickly and permanently relieved by
Lydia E* Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
** Deaji Pixkham : â I have never before given my endorse-
ment for any medicine, but Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound has added so much to my life and happiness that I feel like
making an exception in this case. For two years every month I would
have two davs of severe pain and could find no relief, but one day when
vjsiting a friend I run across Lydia E. Piukhani's Vegetable Com-
pound, â she had used it with the best results and advised me to try it.
I found that it worked wonders with me ; I now experience no pain and
only had to use a few bottles to bring about this wonderful change. I
use it occasionally now when I am exceptionally tired or worn out." â
Miss Alice M. Smith, 804 Third Ave., South Minneapolis, Minn., Chair-
man Executive Committee Minneapolis Study Club.
Beauty and strength in women vanish early in life because of
monthly pain or some menstrual irregularity. Many suffer silently
and see their best gifts fade away. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound helps women preserve roundness of form and
freshness of *faoe because it makes their entire female organism
healthy. It carries women safely through* the various natural
crises and is the safeguard of woman's health.
The t nth about this great medicine is told in the letters from
women being published in this paper constantly.
Mrs. C. Kleinschrodt, Morrison, 111., says : â
"Dear Mrs. Pixkham: â I have suffered ever
i^tfffigSay^ since I was thirteen years of age with my menses.
jf&'^&Mji Tu ev were irregular and very painful. I

New Novels of This
Money-Mad World
THE world is money mad. That statement looks absolutely start-
hngin cold type, but when you realize that it is a sentiment em-
anating: from the foremost political and financial economies' of the
world it is time to berin to sit up and take notice. If you doubt its
truth j list take a casual dance at the popular literature of the hour,
will invariably find that the theme is wealth, and more wealth, and
yet again more wealth â wealth in the spending even as much as wealth
in the making. Not the fairy tale lore of wealth of bysrone ajres. but
modern wealth that has to <io with empire building, the destiny of na-
tions, the struKjrle f or commercial dominance and aristocratic social su-
premacy of the men and women of the hour, vea, almost of the ven*
mm i U L Cl Â£ Â£ Vast and so raoid is the " 6e and faI1 of the bureauocracv of
wealth. "l\o more the tales of buried treasure of picturesque pirates or
lost rmnes and enchanted palaces stored with riches, but the cold that
glitters before our very eyesâ rich, yellow gold that we watch in the
makingâ gold that is accumulated while you wait by men we all know,
and spent with greater ease and facility by women who are better
known. " " â¢ _
Of such a dozen books that everybody is reading: rijrht now mitrht
be mentioned at random. To begin with there is "The Spenders."
which is concluded in jthe Sunday Call to-day, and which not only shows
-the excitement of modern money making, but the more subtle art of
spending it Then there is "The Octopus." Frank Norris' famous tale
of the building of vast wealth, and his later book. "The Pit." which tells
?.tÂ£ * u1 st â¢x elc to corner that same vast wealth. Then there are
The Autocrat. "The Thirteenth District," "Tainted Gold." "The Mis-
sissippi Bubble, etc.. etc. Indeed the list might be swelled indefinitely
But of all these novels none are quite like unto that very latest
creation, 'Brewster s Millions." In point of fact "Brewster's Millions"
is absolutely unlike anythine that has ever been written before for in it
a perfectly adorable youne fellow has to spend a million a vear. ret his
money s worth and yet have absolutely nothing to show for it at the
j _d of that time in order that he may inherit six million more. Sounds
fascinating, doesn t it? Well, it is more than that.
Now you may think it is the easiest thing in the world to spend a
million. .Never tried it. of course. But wait until you have read
"Brewster _s Millions, which begins in the next Sunday Call, and you
will see what a stupendous task It is to spend a million a vearâ actually
fpend itâ not dissipate it or Rive it away or lose it in false speculation
but get your money s worth as you would if you had only a hundred in-
stead of a cool million.
But the popular craze of literature of the bright, snappy, up-to-date
sort goes even further than this. Never before was there such a tre-
mendous demand for short stone s of the best sort. And what better
reading could you get? _ A srood short story is a complete novel in con-
densed form, and it is lust such excellent reading as this that is pro-
vided m the Sunday Call s new "Half Hour Storiettes." of which next
Sunday you will pet two full pa^s. Here are some of the titles-
"Mysterious Leofric" "In the FiÂ«h of Striped Death." "The Secret of
the Jamaica Sink Hole " "The Beautiful Miss Marriam." "Fables for
the Foolish. Shorty Mahan s Passire," "Love's Golden Tether "
"While the Train Waited." "What Tiny Peter Did," ett : etc Best of
all there is a new short story by A. Conan Doyle "The SharfmJ P*
fore"; "Millions in His Dreams." by Mark Twain: "Me-owsof f Kitt^'
by Kate Thyson Marr; 'The Oracle of Mulberry Center." by S E R'fZV
etc. etc. . â¢ xvlscr Â«
And besides all this there is the regular Sunday Magazine section
g,ving you the very latest in everything that is going on in the world
to-day. .The Sunday Call can't be beat worm

It Is usually the Idiot who rocks thÂ«
boat that lives to regret it
All of the large steam plants in San
Francisco have been approached by rep
resentatives of the interested capitalists
and in some cases options have been given
on plants. Some of these have expired,
but within a few days there has been
a revival of effort In the matter. Nearly
every concern in San Francisco and those
in Oakland like the Eureka, Cascade, Con
tra Costa and Domestic, who do business
on both sides of the bay, have had ap
praisements made on the plants.
All of this is preliminary to the organ
ization of the trust, If sufficient strength
can be secured by a consolidation to con
trol the business. Some of the laundry
owners have taken a great deal of inter
est in the movement, while others are
showing no anxiety to get aboard the
combination train.
Oakland's laundries that carry on a
business exclusively in this city, such as
the smaller. French laundries, have not
been invited to take part in the plan of
organization. So far the negotiations
have been confined exclusively to the
larger businesses.
Both cash and stock exchange proposi
tions have been advanced in the matter
of payment for the laundries that shall
b# absorbed. Thus far a flat coin basis
his been established by a number of the
money-making laundries In the prelimin
ary discussions about the project It is
expected that the matter will very short
ly reach a decisive point. The under
standing among the proprietors is that
the trust plan will not be consummated
in an organization unless at least 75 per
cent of the business is enlisted. That
would mean a controlling hold on the
laundry industry on both sides of the
bay.
Credit for the move is given to the
Rosenfeld Sons, owners of the Contra
Costa Laundry Company of this city.
Among well informed laundry proprietors
the story is current that the Rosenfelda,
who are also known In San Francisco
as heavy dealers in coal, have associated
with them in the proposed laundry trust
the Slosses of the Alaska Commercial
Company.
It is the opinion of conservative laun
dry men that the consolidation of at
least 75 per cent of the enterprises in
business would be required to give suffi
cient control to swing the project. To
effect the combination would require the
investment, according to men in the
business, of at least $2,500,000. 8ome of
the large plants in San Francisco like
the United .States. San Francisco and
Cascade, Shasta, St. Nicholas. and White
Star run as high as $200,000 to $300,000 in
valuation.
Consolidation of all of the steam laun
dries of Oakland and San Francisco into
one corporation which shall control the
linen cleaning Industry about the bay la

a number of prominent capitalists who
are Interested In the business now.

the puritanical order and in plain view of
the household,
This destruction of the ancient canons
of Berkeley, by which from time immemo
rial the eds. and co-eds, have done their
calling In pretty much any way they
pleased, was brought about by a visit
Mlas Mary Ingle Bentley, general secre
tary of the Young Women's Christian As
sociation, paid yesterday to the boarding
houses of Berkeley. She hired a horse and
buggy and called on 150 landladies, and
from 1<7 of them exacted a promise that
they would see that their co-ed, boarders
received In the parlor. The three that re
fused to comply will probably suffer, for
they will not be put on the Young Wom
en's Christian Association's approved list
of boarding-house* â a penalty that almost
amounts to blacklisting.
Miss Secretary Bentley says she is
pleased with the almost universal ac
quiescence of the boarding-house ladies
to her requests. She feels that the con
sciences of herself and the other officers
of the Young Women's Christian Associa
tion, who promised country mothers tc
lock after their girls, are now at rest. Htr
visit of yesterday was the result of a re
cent conference which she had with Miss
Ethel Musgrove and Mfss Mary Page,
president and Bible director, respectively,
of the association, who agreed that pro
miscuous visiting should be tabooed.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Aug. 15.
James "A. Serrine, supposed to be
wealthy, died at SIS Broadway yesterday,
and his body was hurriedly shipped to
San Francisco for cremation by friends.
According to Attorney Herbert Patterson,
they took a recently made will of the old
man's and a box containing stocks and
bonds. To be on time. Public Adminis
trator Gray filed a petition for special
letters on the estate to-day, and while the
petition has not been granted he has it
on file awaiting the first move made for
probating It.
Serrine was a product of the frontier.
He is reputed to own a rich mine In New
Mexico, over which half a hundred men
have been killed. It is said that a short
time ago he refused an offer of $150,000
for It. He Is known to have owned real
estate in Chicago. He died with two or
three men about him, and a man giving
the name of Fred Kleupfer was asked to
witness the will.
Patterson In conversation to-day said:
"This haste is odd, the making of. the
will and the taking of a box supposed to
contain valuables by men who were not
bound to him by other ties than those of
friendship, so we are prepared and wait
ing to see what they will do In the mat

New, York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 15 â The cotton market
closed qufe>t and practically featureless, with
prices fluctuating within a point or two from
opening figures.
As usual on Saturday, the local demand, for
fruits was active and fresh arrivals of choice
stock met with ready sale, with occasional lots
of fancy selling at a slight advance over the '
quotations. Supplies of common Apples, 1
Peaches, Plums and No. 2 Bartlett Pears were
plentiful, and although trade was active, prices j
for such stock had 'no quotable change. There
was some little inquiry for fine Pears .and
Peaches in wrappers for shipment on the Port
land steamer, and fancy Grapes, too, were
wanted for that purpose. Receipts of Bartlett
Pears from the river were Heht, and as the
market was well cleaned up, prices of canning
stock had a narrower range. Green Gage and
Egg Plums In bulk were in light supply and |
found prompt sale at steady rates. The can
nera were in the market for choice Peaches,
but paid no attention to common offerings.
Apricots continued scarce and firm, and choice
Nectarines, which were also scarce, brought a
high price. Watermelons and Cantaloupes
were In free supply, and although the demand
was fair, prices continued easy. Nutmeg Mel
ons were higher under a good demand and light
receipts. Receipts of Grapes were less liberal
than" on the preceding day. but prices of small
packages had a general decline, the demand
for shipping .being light and the quality of the
offerings poo?v
Trade In Citrus Fruits was light, and with
the exception of Mexican Limes, prices were
largely nominal. Ripe Bananas were still very
scarce. Occasional lots of partly ripened stock
were being withdrawn from the cellars, but
prices were too Irregular to quote.

seek the society of any. His neighbor,
Abbey, is his great friend; Frank Millet
and Alfred Parsons are ' others. Helleu,

gent and so is Manchlnl, the Italian

Sargent much admires.
Sargent has three fads. He is passion
ately fond of music and plays the piano
well. He bicycles and keeps himself lit
by dally rides about the environs of Lon
don. He collects pictures and his studio
is filled with the work of his contempo
raries. His generosity to young artists
Is proverbial. He Is a visitor in one. of
the art schools and takes keen pleasure
In methods of teaching art.
No living artist makes such a fabulous
lrcoxne from his cxtu&l work-in-hand as
Sargent. His fee Is $5000 a figure, and last
year he exhibited seventeen pictures,
several of which included three figures.
The seventeen excluded a number of
paintings which for reasons best known
to himself Mr. Sargent sent direct to their
purchasers. Mr. Sargent invests . his
money Immediately and spends compara
tively little on himself. He lives at the
studios and has one man servant.
Edwin Austin Abbey, "who does painted
Illustrations," Is painting his vast official
picture of the coronation partly in Chel
sea and partly at his country place, Mor
gan Hall, where all sorts of armor and
other historic: settings help him* in the
staging of the ponderous picture. For
this, too, the King has already given Mr.
Abbey several sittings, and the Queen will
give at least one before the work is con
cluded six months hence. Nearly all the
great Dukes and Duchesses have sat. It
Is a fact not generally known that Mr.
Abbey's picture of the coronation is not
primarily for English consumption, if "one
may use the .expression, but for traveling
purposes. In the .United It is being
pafnted at the expense of Messrs. Agnew,
the picture dealers, and will be exhibited
by them in America immediately on com
pletion. In- addition to this picture, Mr.
Abbey is at present working on one of a
Series of paintings by various artists

London. These illustrations will hang in

appeared and In Its place a less reputable

cow.
Sargent's position Is unique. Three In
teresting things are true of him. He Is
the lion of the hour; his Income from his
annual sale of paintings is $100,009; he has
his enemiesâ es every strong man should
have. Lionizing Is not one little bit to
Sargent's taste. He closed his rambling
studios the other day and ran away In
sheer terror of his admirers. The last
week before he went he couldn't even
be induced to open his letters. He ft
said to have remarked that he simply
couldn't bear it if any on* else asked him
to paint them. So he departed for Spain
Just In the height of the London season
and will remain there until the last of
September. He will not even paint an
other Wertheimer for a few months. The
wealthy banker has some member of his
family sit to Mr. Sargent every year and
is himself probably the maddest of the
Eargcntites. He pays his bills to the
painter in blank checks.
Sargent is so ehy that if you say palrft
ing to him he blushes. He is the most
modest of men and never refers either to
himself or his work. Sargent Is unmar
ried and his confirmed bachelorhood Is 'a
matter of regret to many high-born Eng
lish ladies. Tet Mr. Sargent does not
pose as - a woman hater. Indeed, when
ladies visit his studio on the rare occa

minus more intermezzos than Mas
cagr.i ever thought of in the shape of
bell boys, telephone calls and visitors,
and we had happened upon the subject
of the foreign musician's opinion of
America. Mascagni and our symphony
concerts of last season led the vray there,
with a word or two as to the curious
treatment accorded the gifted Italian by
the Easterners.
And, by the way, there seems to have
been another tide to the latter storyâ
not strangely. Maestro Pietro himself
seems to have been not unlnclJncd to the
"Indian" viewpoint as to our musical de
velopment. As he has lately and en
gagingly expressed it (in Paris) his visit
here served to confirm him in the opinion.
perhaps it should be said particularly as
to â down, vanity, down!â as toâ but after
all those fervent columns I penned! â

larly as to poor, big, worshipful Cali
fornia herself. And she loved thee bo,
Pietro! â¢ â¢ â¢ But the caliber of the or
chestra that Mascagni Imported appears
to have borne humorous testimony to his
opinion of us. As Mr. Scheel, modestly
among the many, cays, it was "the worst
(sforz.) orchestra in the world." The
singers, too, though greatly better â but
there, let bygones be bygones.
However, the woolly Easterner seems to
have been not wholly to blame in the
matter of the Mascagni fiasco. As to
poor us, well, let It comfort us that the
maestro expressed entire willingness to
play the missionary here for $4000 a
month when he was approached on the
eubject during- his recent visit. Just what
that means one is unprepared to say.
Let us hope, however, that it Is a token
of the affection that the handsome maes
tro was wor.t so flatteringly to express
for us. But this Is neither here nor
there. Revenons aux nos moutons, to Fritz

filled out the thin, fine, nervous face, and

But there is not a flash lost from the
eyes that used to look lightnings into
men's veins, nor a grain of the familiar
magnetism. Ten weeks from now these
will be fused with the texture Â»of an
orchestra that will hardly be recognizable

clam-like.
"Particularly?"
Then he owned, as one would confess to
a penchant for appropriating one's neigh
bor's dog: "I like much church music. I
have some motets that may not be so
bad. Orchestral things, too." Then his
eyes, with a new, roguish glisten, an
nounced the following: "I should like to
haf been a monk sometime!"
"Ah, you want. to be a 'Palaestrina," I
said. ' a "Â¦ Â¦
"Ach, yes!" he flashed and sighed.
"Purest, greatest music that Is. And mod
ern, so modern. â¢ â¢ ?â But the 'modern
csf of all Is Johann Sebastian Bachâ"
"The 'Chaconne'!" I cried.
"Everything Is there." Scheel agreed,
and we shook mental hands over a com
mon idol.
"But think," I reverted, "what a chance
you have to have your compositions fitly
interpretedâ with an orchestra to your
hand." ' : r-Z-V: -V.Y
"Composers not often conduct their
own work bo well," the conductor dis
sented. "Very seldom, in fact. .Many
times I have i.seen it. I played violin
when Brahms conduct one of his sym
phonies, for example!. Never nave I
heard It played so badly. Ti'ie compoEer
Is very satisfied If it Is nearly so^some

"You are to conduct at the same desk
with Strauss next season, I see?"
"Five concerts," Mr. Scheel happily af
firmed. "Two in Boston and one each in
Philadelphia. Baltimore and Washington.
We take each half the concert."
"I see* that that Brussels manâ "
"Conducted Strauss much better than
Strauss himself, according to London's
critical folk," I said. "That would go
to support your .experience."
"It is not unlikely," , Scheel concurred.
"Are you, too, a Strauss worshiper?"
I asked superfluously.
"Everything he has written I like," was
the wholesale. acknowledgment.. "I grant
his music takes time to understand. It
Is philosophical, ethical, religiousâevery
thing. Strauss touches depths that have
never before been touched. He moves
among the old silences of the soul
plucks at the strings of very life, pain,
death. â¢ â¢ â¢ He is a wonder," Scheel
unexpectedly, concluded.
"What should you say his heredity
was?" I asked.
â¢ Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner, Strauss,
Surely!" Scheel answered.
"Germany really has done rather
wellâ" I laugh.
"Of course there Is little Master Bach,
Mozartâ Papa Haydn was a 'very nlca
man also," Scheel continued. "! "Take
Meister Gluck, too, for opera. Then
there's Weberâ Wagner did not forget
him. Don't forget Schubert either, for
his songs, in Master Strauss' ' making.
If or Brahms."
nearer symphony than anything we have
yet had.
Miss Margarete Scheel. who looks at
you with her father's eyes and .who is a
pianist and "great friends" with her dis
tinguished papa, comes with him this
time. She told me how she had looked
forward to seeing her father's "second
home," how he had looked forward to
this, fifth visit. Then, putting on a coat
with a bloomy sprig of Monterey cypress
pinned to it, she left him to our. tender
mercies.
"But the little ' saviors of America are
not all found in Italy," the distinguished
German was saying. "I am afraid every
little fiddler In Germany thinks just about
the same. He picks up his bow and says:
'Wait till I go to that America! I'll show
them how to do things!' "
It is as well to preface that I must give
up the attempt to reproduce Mr. Scheel's
piquant Teutonisms. But as the conductor
seems to be as delightfully anxious about
his accent as was Mozart about his
dancing, I can handsomely assure him
It Is not the artless and ardent affair of
the Midwinter Fair days, nor even of the
pre-Phlladelphlan era. True, the land of
symphony and lager still claims It, but
only to its flavorous advantage.
"Perhaps the foreign musicians' atti
tude la a little the fault or the Americans
themselves," Mr. Scheel pursued. "They
are too tolerant, too politeâ I think the
most really polite people anywhere. They
will take from the foreigner work they
would not for a moment stand from their
countrymen."
"And treat the native genius with scant
courtesy to balance things," I add. "Mac-
Dowell, now. Who gives his orchestral
work? Our good Mr. Steindorff here."
"Ah, but I have given MacDowell's
works," the conductor 'interrupted, his
eyes kindling above that eagle beak of his
that so well bears out their command.
"MacDowell is the American Beethoven."
"Beethoven?" I question. Then venture:
"He is much like Grieg to me."
"No; more earnest." Scheel Insisted.
"And it is the Beethoven scale. â¢ â¢ â¢
Yes; I have given his Indian Suiteâ very
much. I like It, and he has played for me
his piano concerto. Ach! a fine fellow.
â¢ â¢ â¢ Theodore Thomas Is very sympa
thetic with the American composer. He
brings out many of their works. But it
is true the conductors are not kind to
American genius."
"Who else is doing good orchestral
things here?" I asked, "besides Mac-
Do well?" . '
"We have played a very fine overture
of Chadwick's," the conductor replied.
"Arthur Foote is alsd an excellent com
poser â though mostly of songs."
"What kind of a composer Is Fritz
Scheel V I ask then.
"Ach! I don't like to bother the people
with my stuff while there's Beethoven to
conduct," Fritz Scheel said, his eyes
twinkling busily. He blushed as busily,
being still the same modest, greatly-sim
ple person In spits of all his laurels.
"But you have composed?" I chal
lenged. 1
"And nowâ what really mattersâ are
we to have any Straussâ with all this
highly respectable parentage â here?" I
anxiously demand.
"I cannot yet say," the conductor an
swered. "His scoring is so exactingâ
eight Â¦ horns In 'Ein Heldenleben,' for
example. There are only four obtainable
In San Francisco. We may be able to do
'Till Eulenspiegel." " } Â¦
"You must!" I said. "We haven't had
a scrap of Strauss here. Only some of the
songs. But you have some other things"
we.; want to hear, I knowâ oh, Strauss!
May 1 hear of some of the other music
that is among the likelihoods?",
"I have a great deal," the conductor
laughed. "Look here," and he pulled out
a list from his pocket that showed a store
of symphony that would last through a
ten years' war. Here are some of the
things: Tschalkowsky Symphony No. 3,
Suite, op. 43, No. 1, and the tone poem.
"The Lake of Swans"; the tone poem,
"Lesende," by Sibelius; some new sym
phonic dances, " by Grieg; 'Symphony,
Gernateln, "Mlrjam"; d' Albert overture,
"Aua der Improvisator"; a "Lustspiel"
overture by Rezlncek; â¢ the Vorsplel
from the second act of Max Schilling's
"Ingwelde"; two Konigsklnder. by Fritz
.Vollbach; the "King Lear" overture by
Berlioz; a ballet suite by Glazounow;
"Llebcsfruhllng" overture by Georg
Schumann, and most of the standard lit
erature. , .
"Truly there will be no famine," I ac
knowledge. â¢ â¢. â¢ "I wonder how you
will find the orchestra?"
"That remains to be seen," said Scheel.
"The men did splendidly for Mascagni,"
I witness, "especially considering the few
rehearsals.' "Got all the notes, and very
much more."
"Ah, but you are past that period
here," Scheel Insisted. "You are past the
stage of looking for the notes. That was
gone by five years ago, "when 'I was here
last: Now one looks for the music."
"But we have so little chance here.
That terrible money." â¢ .
"It will come: It will come!" Scheel
consoles. "Last season there was a deficit
of $70,000 In the affairs of the Philadelphia
orchestra. This season they have pulled
together, and no musician In the orches
tra receives leas than 537 50 a week for
his services. Symphony orchestras are
not made In a*day."
"I know you think "the atmosphere here
musical " I recalled. SS&SlKiSSelLtSSSS
"Exceptionally." the conductor granted.
"Boston is perhaps the most musical of
American cities. But the atmosphere
prows everywhere very quickly. V Curious
ly enough, Americans who travelare the
last to see this. They go to Europe, hsar
things, and then come back to say the
Brahms symphony as given by Mr.
Thomas Is not the Brahms symphony as
glxen by Felix Welngartner. Neither it
is. ; But that Is not It. ,, It is impossible to
compare a performance that happened
months ' ago with one of to-day. ;Â¦ When
music Is gone, it is gone. You can't re
peat ; the memory, only dimly. A sym-
phony once played is flown awayâvan
ished. Even what I did myself yesterday
I am not sure of. â¢ â¢ â¢ Then there's the
matter of moods. I am sure I never
played the 'Tannhauser' overture twice
alike, or the 'Eroica' symphony. Only a
machine could do that. I know that I
play Beethoven once the best In my life.
* ? * And so much depends on the or
chestra. The finer it is, the higher the in
spiration. When it gives to you lightest
touch, it seems that nothing there is that
you cannot do. Fritz Scheel with' the Mid
winter Fair Orchestra is not Fritz Scheel
with the Bulow Orchestraâ is it not? But
Fritz Scheel with the Philadelphia Or
chestra is not Fritz Scheel with the Bu
low Â¦ Orchestra, either. Nor can the
listener determine just the difference, only
vaguely. Sometimes, then, surely, the
traveling American should give the noinu
orchestra the benefit of the doubt. Butâ
not often"â and Scheel shook his thought
ful head. .
"You were long with Von Bulow?"
"We was three years togetherâ biggest
friends. Never have a fight," the conÂ«
ductor laughed. "He was, of course, the
best man before Wagner."
"How long 1 have you been conducting,
Mr. Scheel?"'
"Seventeen long years," the conductor
replied. "And I well remember my first
conducting. It was at the Schwerein
Court Theater. I was first violin there,
and I took the conductor's place. The
opera was 'Robert le DIable,' and after we
had started I found thero was a. whole
act missing and nowhere to be found! I
conducted it from the first violin score."
"You came to America first to the Mid
winter Fair?"
"No; to the Chicago World's Fair. Since
then, well,"â and the conductor looked out
affectionately at the city that lay sleep
ing in the sunlightâ "you know I have not
neglected San Francisco. It seems a sec
ond home to me."

The mental illness of Lan Leno. "the
King's jester" and idol of the English
music hall, and his necessary departure
from the music' hall stage has robbed
London of one of its quaintest fljruras.
High and low, rich and poor, are lament
ing Mr. Leno. His career has been short,
but between 30 and 40 years of age he
amassed a fortune of more than half a
million dollars. His wife and bevy of
children will always be rich, whether or
not Mr. Leno returns to the stage. The
homely little man whose jokes have kept
all London laughing was once a factory
hand. Neither he nor his family have
made any effort to change their station
in life. They are content to remain cock
ney. But Mr. Leno delighted to load his
wife and young daughter with diamonds.
They possess some rare precious stones.
For himself Mr. Leno's keenest pleasure
away from the stage has always been
with flowers and chickens. He made a
specialty of rose growing. It is a sad
fact that Mr. Leno's loss of mind, due
to overwork, was immediately brought
about by too much charity matineeing.
He has never been known to refuse his
services for any kind of charitable per
formance. His reputation for befriend
ing poor actors is almost as great as Sir
Henry Irvlns's.

a small, cold chill, as I read

Sunday night's Impressions of that re
markable youns woman. The "difference

when I have burned Incense to a new
Idolatry o'ernlght the cold type of It ia
the last thing I seek thÂ© next day.
But undoubtedly I had committed my
self hopelessly about Miss Elfle Fay.
And to an unknown Idol. In spite of a
proud diligence In following the merry
Thespian through these United States I
had never even seen her name. Yet
there she was Instantly to me the axch
exemplar of the song and dance god. And
I had said so. fully, unreservedly. What
if my mood, or the inspiring effect of the
best bill at the Orpheum since "befo* de
wa* " had deceived me? Then I remem
bered the shrieking house and was re
assured. But, consclencefully. anxiously,
I went to see the young woman again.
Incidentally achieving a record of two
visits to the Orpheum In one week.
My chills were lost. I found Miss Fay
not only what I had thought her. but
more, on second hearing, and seeing â In
deed, seeing.' She is quite the most orig
inal personality of the week, unique, and
glltterlngly gifted in her line. Her
chubby, baby face, copper-yellow hair,
and sonsie figure, she uses exactly as the
artist uses his paint, as the sculptor his
clay. She sketches now the tough girl,
again the leering hoodlum, the bad boy.
even a monkey, with a startling truth of
characterization that appeals as the late
Phil May's truths appealed: as the work
of the Parisian. Caran d'Ache, appeals
Her monkey imitation has the value of a
Japanese grotesque, her enfant terrible
the naive diablerie of a Gavroche. Pos
sibly it would take a Paris most fully
to sense the flnnese, grace and lightning
wit of Miss Fay's art. but meantime she
is here for another week.
That Miss Elfle Fayâ her real name, by
the wayâ had the foresight to bo born of
a French mother and an Irish papa, I was
not surprised to find when I went behind
the scenes to chat with "tbfc Queen of
Avenue A." Neither was I surprised to
find that Miss Fay had been Invited to a
Parl3 theater, nor that she was already
previously engaged here by Weber &
Rush for the next three years. One thing
I was surprised to find, that the "gray
eyes" of my first impression were a pair
of brown diamonds off stage, an illusion
of the make-up, as the elflsh vaudevllllan
explained.
Hugh Fay, her father, was an Irish
comedian, with the utmost objection to
his daughter's choice of a profession.
But what's in will out. and at 17 Mis3
Elfie, after being variously expelled from
school, also running away freely, found
herself where she certainly belongs. Sad
parts were ' her childish ambition. "Ogive
me bback me chelld! â snow, please!" as
she unctuously gurgled It the other night.
She used to borrow the cook's apron and
put It en backward as a train, then prac
tice falling on the back of her head be
fore a mirror. Then she had no knowl
edge of how to "break" a fall, thinking
that it was "just a matter of getting used
to having your brains flattened." Her
father's timely arm. she says, probably
saved the small Fay skull from hopeless
fracture.
But at last she found herself on tha
stage.
For some time this spelled Hoyt's com
edies on the road. Then came the Inev
itable desire to "break Into" New York.
This seemed Impossible, but there la ap
parently no such word in the Fay vocab
ulary. No one knew her nor cared about
the ambitious young woman, but she at
last found her way Into the chorus of
"Mile. 'Awkins." But this was not- her
goal and she went in a very curious and
characteristic fashion about getting what
she did want. From the first rehearsal
she studied what she would do at every
moment of the comedy where the chorus
came Inâ briefly, everything that was not
In the rehearsal. She did It and the next
day the new chorus girl was town talk.
The price of her rebellion was a salary
-raised from *13 to $73 a week, with a po
sition on the road afterward as the star
of the company.
Since that time there has been a two
years' experience In London with "ThÂ©
Belle of New York" and at the Empire
Music Hall. London Â«he likes and gave
me some private convulsions over her ex-Â»
perience.
â¢^"They're dear there," she said. "They
-used to sayâ drawling It beautlf ullyâ 'Isn' t
she a rlppah?' on the street. I'd say
â¢What. O!' and they'd say, 'Isn't sha
' qualntr Quaint!!!"
Then Miss Fay drew her face down Into
an Imitation of the late Queen Victoria,
that the Empire laughed at and objected
to with considerable vehemence. I don't
see why, for you couldn't tell the dif
ference.
