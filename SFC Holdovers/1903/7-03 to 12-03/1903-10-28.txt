CONDUCT BITTER VENDETTA.:
BOSTON, Oct. ' 27-^The murder. . of Sa
gouni 'is not regarded as being of great
political significance by Armenians in this
city, but rather as'a result of a - bitter
feeling which exists between two' factions
within the" revolutionary ' party itself.' 16
support of this it was cited thej recent
attempt to assassinate an Armenian'edi
tor, Peter Kureglan, in- this city by mem
bers of the revolutionary party, said, to
hold Socialistic views, which Kuregflan
opposed. : At the trial an. officer .of i the
party testified that the. members of .the
Socialist wing had taker! oath to remove
"all obstructions" in ;- spreading' their
views. ?f;Hi â¢Â¦â¢Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦!.â¢ Â¦Â¦â¢' Â¦- . Â¦â¢â¢. :
It is stated that Sagouni's life had
been threatened on account of his partici
pation in the exposure, by the editor of a
Boston newspaper, Young Armenia, pf
the misappropriation of funds by a fac
tion of the Armenian revolutionists.
These men arfe alleged td have Â¦ collected
$20,090 In America in 1902 and to have put
the money in their ow.n pockets instead of
pushing the propaganda for the emancipa
tion of the Armenians, for which the
money was subscribed: Â¦ â¢" Â¦â¢â¢Â¦-- â¢â¢ i
A convention of the Armenian passivists
has been in* session here and it is sug
gested the opportunity was chosen by the
violent faction as favorable for disposing
of the principal leader.
Sagouni's frlendfi attribute the murder
to the Alfarlst section of the Hentchakist
Society. This section, headed by a man
named Alfar, was expelled from the so
ciety after the split in 1895, when. It is
alleged, the Alfarists were paid spies of
the Sultan of Turkey.
The feud became more acute and an at
tack on the editor of the Boston edition
of the Hentchak followed. A former edi
tor of the Hentchak, Nazarbeck, was
stabbed last week at Lausanne,- Switzer
land, by Alfarists.
Sagounl' returned, to London yesterday
after, settling. 'the affairs of. an associate
In Switzerland, who was recently'assas
sinated, aYid was entering 'his residence
when a man rushed across the road and
fired four shots at him in quick succes
sion, the iaet. bullet entering the region
of the'heart. The murderer,' who ap
peared to be a foreigner, fled. The only
.clews to. the man In. possession 1 of the au
thorities are a felthat and a silver-plated
revolver, b^oth made' in America, 'which
he dropped in his flight. Â¦* ' â¢
ATTRIBUTE CROIE' TO EIVALSi
The Macedonian committee attempted
to co-operate with the Armenian commit
tee in an anti-Turkish revolution in 1S95,
but subsequently .withdrew because of the
Jnterecine strife of the Armenians.
The murder presumably was committed
by a fellow Armenian recently from .the
United States. The assassination had a
political motive and was characterized by
a. boldness to which London ha3 seldom
been treated. It- created an unusual sen
sation here, since it .appears to have been
only an incident in a long and bitter ven
detta between two factions of Armenian
revolutionists. The attempted murder of
Kuregan. in Boston, the recent killing in
Switzerland and the assassination of the
most prominent Armenian in London are
so far achievements credited to the Ar
menian Radicals here. It is said that
.two: members of the opposition party
have- already been killed In Russia,
though the- London Armenian revolution
ary committee denies both knowledge of
and responsibility for the crime.
It is generally expected that Sagounl's
death is only the prelude to other chap
ters In the story of -a bitter feud. The
murderer, who has not yet been appre
hended, left in the hands of the police
two clewsâ a soft felt hat bearing the
name of an American clothing firm and
an automatic pistol *of a recent American
make. Members pf the Armenian com
mittee here express themselves as certain
that the murder is the work of an Alfa
rist, member of the Radical minority. The
police are following up all clews suggest
ed by Sagouni's associates. What may
be a. possible coincidence is suggested by
the fact that the Alfarlst headquarters in
London were recently closed, the mem
bers scattering to Egypt, Smyrna and the
United States. ' ' >

PORTLAND, Or.. Oct. 27.â District At
torney John Hail has wired the District
Attorney at San Francisco to try to find
out upon the arrival of the steamer Alli
ance at that port which member of the
crew attacked Mrs. A. H. Ames, who took
passage on the last voyage of the Alli
ance from San Francisco to Portland.
The complaint to the District Attorney
here came In the form of letter from
Mr. Ames of Marshfield, Or., the husband
of the woman. According to his state
ment, his wife was returning from a vis-
It tp San Franci3co and on the first night
out rang for a glass of water. It is al
leged that the attendant who answered
the bell brought her a drugged drink of
water. She cried for help, but owing to
her condition could make no loud noise.
The next day she told the steward and
asked to see the captain. This request
was denied, so the letter said, and sho
remained ill In bed until the boat arrived
here. "When she reached home she In
formed her husband of the affair and he
immediately communicated with the Dis
trict attorney. The latter was preparing
to have a John Doe warrant issued when
he learned that the Alliance had sailed
again for San Francisco. He then tele
graphed, asking that the guilty man be
arrested If he could be found. The pen
alty for the offense was formerly death.

cretion of the jury.

that' his hearers be as quiet as possible.
He opened up his remarks by referrlngto

SERVANT GIRL ADMITS
SHE WAS THE BURGLAR
Los Angeles Police Arrest Pretty Em
ploye Who Manufactured a
Crime Story.
. LOS ANGELES, Oct. 27.â Mabel Welper.
the pretty 17-year-old servant girl who on
October 6 was found locked in a closet at
the Home of A. W. Fisher, her employer,
and told a story of having been placed
there by an electric light inspector, who
then robbed the house, is In jail and
charged with the burglary. She has con
fessed her guilt and has produced jewelry
and other valuables worth more than $600,
the tiroceeds of the crime.
The girl was not locked In a closet,
there was no electric light inspector in
the crime, but she committed It without
assistance. Her arrest was made at
Ocean Park to-day, where she was found
wearing one of Mrs. Fisher's watches
and other jewelry. A former employer
had told her how in Chicago men dis
guise themselves as electric light and gas
Inspectors to gain entrance to houses for
the purpose of robbing them. This sug
gested to her an easy means of escaping
detection, so she robbed the Fisher house,
hid her booty, tore her dress in several
places, went Into a closet and began
screaming for help.

or Eureka and the revenue cutters Man
ning and Bear were preparing to start
out to cruise Bering Sea 'in search of
them. The Manning left on the evening
of the 21st and the Bear was to have fol
lowed the next morning.
The course which was mapped out will
cover a cruise of ten or twelve days.
The captains of both the Bear and Man

Attorney Metson, representing Wolf, at
tempted to prove that Simpson's charac
ter was such that he should not be re
garded as a reliable witness. He was
aBkf-d If he had ever been arrested, but
the question was objected to and the ob
jection sustained. Metson agreed to pro
duce depositions from various parts of the
State in which the saloon man has re-
Fided. showing that his imputation was
not of the best. After deliberation the
care was postponed until one week from
to-morrow, when the defense will have a
hcarir.p. There were in the neighborhood
of 100 witnesses present and all were ex
cused, subject to a call from the com
mission.
George B. Simpson, proprietor of the
saloon, was called first and testified to
having paid money to Wolf on three dif
ferent occasions. The first he said was
on August 24. when the sergeant ex
plained that trouble could be made for
the place unless coin was yielded up. On
this date, according to the witness, $10
was paid, and it was understood that a
similar amount should be contributed on
each of the following months while the
officer remained in the district. On the
next day. Simpson claims, he called on
Police' Commissioner Drinkhouse and in
formed him cf what had taken place.
Drinkhouse denounced the sergeant's de
mands and promised an investigation.
The second charge against Wolf Is that
he received $5 from Simpson on Septem
ber 21. Tho circumstances were similar
and on October 6, It is alleged, another
S5 gold piece was received by the police
man. Al Neil!, who is a nominal partner
In the concern, testified to having been
told of the payments by Simpson, and the
books of the paloon, showing such pay
ments, were offered in evidence. James
Baddey, an employe of the Board of Edu
cation, who is engaged as a bartender in
the drinking house when not fulfilling his
duties to the city, gave corroborative
testimony and was dismissed with little
cross-examination.
The case of Police Sergeant Reuben
Wolf was heard in part before the' Police
Commissioners last evening. Wolf was
accused of demanding and accepting
money from a certain saloon in his dis
trict, in consideration of which he of
fered the proprietors immunity from po
lice interference. All the witnesses for
the prosecution were heard and the case
for the defense was postponed until one
week from to-irforYow, when depositions
mill be produced to discredit the testi
mony of the complaining witness.
I-a Grille meekly held out his hands and â¢
collarsrd. Tommy Foster was obliged; td ; i
hold him to keen him from sinking to the"!
floor in abject fear. Mr?. La Grille was j
thundf rstruek on learning that the "hero" '
whom she had wedded by contract was '
only a fraud and a coward after all. '
While they were talking La Grille came
in and Hazen introduced his young friend
Foster. La Grille sized them up mental'y
and suspected that they were by no
rrcans the pair of. fools that they pre-=
i ended to be. To the surprise of his wire,
he denied that he was connected with the
secret service department .of the Govern
ment, and said that he had been a Gov
ernment sleuth, but was not at that time.
Hazen at on.ee exhibited his silver badge,
with the remark, "Here is what the real
badge of a secret service man tboks likcV
Here are a pair of handcuff?, which I will
take the liberty of locking upon your
wrists; so that you may know h6w your

W. S. La Grille, who had been posing as
a hero In Southern California in the role
of assistant chief of the United States
fecret service and proved It by a brass
badge that he had made to order in Los
Angeles, appeared before United States
Court Commissioner Heacock yesterday
and waived examination on the chaTge of
having . fraudulently obtained from a
woman In Loa Angeles the sum of $200 by
representing himself to be a Federal of
ficer. Ball was fixed. at $1000, and he was
ordered' extradited to the United States
District Court, at Los. Angeles to be tried
on that charge.
The maximum penalty for the offense is
a fine of $1000 and Imprisonment in the
State penitentiary for three years. '->_:
United States . Secret Service Agent
Hazen reports I^a Grille to be one of tne
finest liars he ever met. After having en
tered into contract of marriage with an
rstimable young woman of Los Angeles,
whom he had deceived into believing him
to be other than he was, he came to this
city with her. As soon as he arrived he
called upon Dr. W. A. Doherty of 770
O'Farrell street and represented that he
had a United States prisoner in Los An
geles whom he desired to remove to this
city to a quiet sanitarium or other place
where newspaper reporters would not be
likely to find him. As bait La Grille in
formed the doctor that the Government
allowed $r<0 per month for the keeping of
rarh priponer. This was preliminary to
negotiations for a "loan" from the doctor.
Chief Hazen la=t Saturday took United
Slates Secret Service Agent Thomas B.
Foster to, La Grille's rooms : and Intro
duced hlm.jto Mrs. La Grille as an ambi
tious but guileless youth' who wished to
karn the business of- a sleuth. La Grille
was not at home, and while awaiting his
return Mrs. La Grille horrified her visit
ors by relating how many times her hus
band had been shot and stabbed and
clubbed by desperate counterfeiters with
in the last two years. Agent Hazen ex
pressed his doubts a>5 to whether young
Foster would like a calling so prolific in
lesions and hemorrhages, but Foster

of the new "key route" ferry system has
arrived, and it is now being fitted up at
the company's yards in Emeryville. As

up of a motor car. controller car and
two trailers and the arrival of the con
troller now at the yards completes the
necessary equipment for the second
train. The present schedule is a little
fast for the boats and the time of tue
trips will probably be extended from
thirty-four to thirty-seven minutes.
It ia expected that the thirty-minute
schedule will go into effect the first of

John Hansen Jr. of Cerrlto Point, In
"West Berkeley, had a close call for his
life yesterday In the bay half a mile from
his home. The youth's boat capsized
while he was returning from a hunting
trip and he only saved himself from
drowning after the hardest kind of a
struggle. :.
Hansen lost his balance while standing
ud in his boat to shoot at some ducks
and fell into the water. He was loaded
down with a coat filled with shells and
a pair of rubber boots that immediately
filled with water. When he came up out
of the water he was some distance from
the boat, which he barely reached before
his strength gave out. The boat was half
full of water then, but it held him up
until he could divest himself ol his heavy
clothing. Finally he bailee the boat out
and got safely to shore. though he was
more dead than alive when he reached
land.

The end has come. John Alexander Dowie has said at
and the newspaper reporter, collectively ' and individually, is
doomed. No restoration talk is to be wasted upon him, no
hope is held forth to him and he is among the things un
clean. Emanating from such a source this decision may em
phatically be considered the first tangible encouragement
and. vindication which the reporter has received in many,
moons.
The London Westminster Gazette says:
"From the latest report of the British
commercial attache at Peking it may be
noted that the economic position of China
is being improved by the spread of West
ern' education and a markedly increasing
demand for foreign literature. This should
interest English publishers. Hitherto, we
imagine, they have mainly found a mar
ketâand only a limited oneâ at Hongkong
and the treaty ports. But if the China
men in the great cities of the interior are
beginning to buy English and other for
eign books infinite possibilities may re

Fred Nlblo, manager of the Four Co
hans and other attractions, recently en
gaged a press agent who undertook to
"make good" by securing the publication
of a story regarding his employer. His
first effort concerned Mr. Nlblo's son,
who was credited with having made some
exceptionally clever remarks.
Mr. Nlblo read the story over carefully.
"How do you like it?" asked the new
press agent.
"Very good," was the answer, "but I
wculd like to make one change in it."
Mr. Nlblo took a pencil and changed
the age tof the boy from eight years to
two months.
"But," interposed the press agent, "a
two-months-old baby can't talk."
"Can't help It," said Niblo. "You see.
I was married only a year ago."â Boston

A Little Previous.
THE litigation by Mr. Bryan to take from the Ben
nett family of Connecticut a legacy of $50,000 will be
a cause celebre. Mr. Bryan appears as his own at
torney. The lawyer for the Bennetts made a legal argu
ment covering the law as applied to the estates and property
of decedents. Mr. Bryan in rejoinder said that the attorney
for the family failed to comprehend the fine sentiment of
the transaction, jand was influenced by the fact that he is a
gold Democrat and is opposed to Mr. Bryan's politics!
It is the policy of the country to guard legally the es
tates of the dead, to give them lawful distribution, and to
guard them from that very "sentiment" in the testator upon
which Mr. Bryan bases his claim. Sentiment is what leads
to undue influence in the devising of property. It was
shown in the testimony that Mr. Bryan had concealed from
Mrs. Bennett the fact that her husband had willed money
to Mrs. Bryan; because it would be distasteful to her to
have her husband's 'estate divided with another man's wife.
On the face of it -Mr. Bryan is making a sordid attempt,
in an indelicate manner, to get his hands, on money that he
never earned, and his only claim to which ;lies.in the fan
atical prepossession for him of a stranger who was capti
vated by his extravagant political theories and his arts of
persuasion. If Mr. Bryan have any explanation to make
that is consistent' with ethics, professional or- personal, it
is at present somewhat overdue.'

"Parrots? No. there Isn't a great- dÂ«v
raand for parrots any more,"' continued
the dealer. "A man from Mount ' Airy
came in the other day with a fine-looking
bird, which hÂ© said was a goocl talker,
and. sold it to me cheap. I know the na
ture of parrots pretty well, and when this
one failed to show off Its accomplishments
I attributed it to the natural stubbornness
of the bird. But day after day went by.
and it never uttered a sound. All it would
do was to sit on its perch and gesticulate
with its feet, making all sorts of fantastic
motions with Its toes. About a week later
'the man who bad sold it to me came in.
'I thought you said that parrot you sold
me was a good talker,* I said. 'It hasn't
shown any evidence of It. All it doos la
to sit and wriggle its toes.' "That's all
right,' said the Mount Airy man. 'it was
raised in the deaf and dumb asylum." "â

An unconfirmed story has come from Servia that the as
sassins of King Alexander and Queen Draga have been
given as financial compensation for their bloody crime sums
ranging from $400 to $10,000. â¢ For the sake of even Servia,
the nation of regicides, it is to be hoped that the stories of
this new horror never will be confirmed.
sÂ» The child's unconscious Inclination will
be td help you raise the arm, and also
to help you drop it. To obviate this tell
him to ra'se both arms unaided by, you,
then fling them limply down at his sides,
as if he were very tired and could not
hold them up. Try this experiment with
your own arms several times, until you
feel the relaxation of your muscles.
Then get him to do it a few times with
you, until his motions are entirely free
from constraint. Children think this a
Joke and enter into the spirit of it without
any trouble, if made to feel that It is
"just for fun."
When you have tried this several times
take his wrist lightly in your hand again.
Turn his head away, so that he cannot
see how far you are going to raise his
arm, or when you are going to drop it,
for if he is watching you he will uncon
sciously help you as before.
Now raise his arm, very slowly, holding
hit as lightly as possible, so that you
max detect the slightest inclination to push forward or hold back on his part. "When
you have slowly raised the arm as high as his head, release it suddenly. If it Is not
perfectly relaxed it will stay in the upraised position an instant after you have
ceased to touch It before it drops down. Impress It upon him that he must neither
raise the arm nor drop it, but that you are going to do all the work in' this game
you are playing. ". Â¦ . â¢' Â¦ Â¦
Be very careful that the wrist ascends In a perfectly straight line each time. It
is of the greatest importance.
When this exercise has been tried with both arms until they have become abso
lutely limp and relaxed, for thevtlme being.' place the right arm and hand lightly
on the table, with the palm of fj>e hand and the fingers touching the table. The
hand must be perfectly flat, but with fingers and thumb spread loosely.
I Next draw the thumb (or first finger, as it is called in music) in toward the palm
of the hand, curving its joints as much as possible without at the same time caus
ing discomfort. Be careful not to move the other fingers or the wrist at all. In
drawing the thumb toward the other fingers all the movement is started at the top
of the thumbâ that Is. the end of the thumb describes a wide half circle and the
two. Joints merely follow the lead of the end of the thumb. 'V;''
Now, leaving the thumb resting lightly almost on its tip, draw the other fin
gers slowly end lightly toward it. raising the joints and the wrist gradually at the
same time until the fingers each rest lightly on their very tips. Be sure as the
hand stands thus that the first Joint of each finger Is as nearly vertical as possible,
and that the thumb retains the position gained by Its half-circle movementâ 1. e.,
the end resting;on its left side near the top of the point of the nail. V* .'.Â¦' â¢'
It is difficult to get the first joint of the little (or fifth) finger to stand exactly
vertical, but the nearer vertical it is the better. When the first joints are thus
properly placed the hand will be in perfect position for playingâ in other words,
the fingers, from the tips of the nails upward, will describe an .arch of which the
third knuckle of the middle finger will be the topmost point. The wrist will be Just
a trifle higher than the top knuckle when viewed from the side, the tips of the fin
gers will" rest lightly on the table and the elbow will swing free- from It two inches
or so. "Â¦'':Â¦ / â¢ ;-' >-Â¦_; -.
Be careful not to raise the wrist too high nor to drop it. Let it stand easily In the
aforementioned relation to the knuckles. This exercise is called "hand-shaping."
As soon as the position is perfect let the child try his relaxing exercise again.
Do not be discouraged if his muscles tighten persistently at first. It is only to
be expected, particularly as soon as he tries to do something . with them, as in the
hand-shaping. Tfte difficulty will soon disappear, however, and to aid it here is aji
cther exercise:
Place the little pupil's hand and arm in
playing position once more, and, holding
his wrist lightly, slowly move it in a cir
cle. As the wrist describes the circle the
' fingers follow it, the shorter ones even be
ing raised a trifle from the table as they
follow the motions of the wrist. Here,
again, the wholÂ© aim is to relax the mus
cles, and arm, elbow and fingers must be
limp and receptive, merely following the
motions of the wrist
Get the child to center his thought on
the wrist as much as possible, and be
sure that it is the wrist that leads the
motion and not the elbow, as is very apt
to be the case unless the exercise is
watched very carefully. At the end of
each revolution the hand and arm must
be in playing position. * '
"Every moment or two let the child rest
â¢ his right arm and try the left, letting him
get up and move around the room oc
casionally to relieve the tension-

Sand-Shaping Exercise â Perfect
Playing: Position.
THE Modesto Herald indorses the proposition made by
Engineer Nourse to the auditing board of the Com
missioners of Public Works for the closing of the big
sloughs in the Tuolumne River, near the river's mouth and
on the San Joaquin River at points in Stanislaus County. It
is declared by the Herald that "the closure of these
sloughs is of great importance to the people of this county
and to all sections tributary to the Northern San Joaquin."
Engineer Nourse's report contains the statement that
the action suggested by him must result in improving the
channel of the San Joaquin River. Confined to the river
proper, he says, the water will scour out a comparatively
deep channel through existing bars. He finds that the San
Joaquin River is seven feet deep at a point directly above
the influence of the sloughs, but is only two feet deep just
below. The engineer was directed to make a specific and de
tailed report. This has started discussion on the part of
those who have interests to be affected. The Modesto Her
ald argues at some length:
"It is not so much the commerce carried, but the fact
that the waterway is available for commerce that renders the
matter of importance, its influence on freight rates saving
us a large sum annually. This is strikingly illustrated by
comparison of the freight rates to Modesto and to Living
ston, twenty-eight miles south of Modesto. The general
rate to Modesto., let us say, is $1 20; to Livingston it is
$2 20. A general merchandise firm operating at Livingston
made big wages with its teams last fall by hauling -from
Modesto to Livingston by wagon the goods that were
brought to Modesto by rail. The Valley road is not the
influencing factor, for that road approaches nearer to Liv
ingston than to this city. It is the fact that we can land
freight here by water, during several months in the year
that affords us this advantage. Freight rates on grain from
the west side in particular and a portion of this side are in
fluenced by the same consideration." .
In conclusion the Modesto Herald has to say that- "the
State should close the larger of these sloughs and the land
owners will then attend to the smaller. It is worth hun
dreds of thousands of dollars to that part of the valleytrib
utary to the Upper San Joaquin River that the waterway be
kept open for commerce."
Rail freight rates in California are undoubtedly kept
down by water competition. This is demonstrated to the
satisfaction of many localities where there are navigable
streams. Low rates to the interior are important to large
distribution centers like San Francisco, having a trade in
the interior to ; maintain^. They are of "equal importance to
the . farmers whose products are seeking market.
SLOUGHS AND COMMERCE.
"Those were great days on the upper
Mississippi River," he said, "when the
first steamboat In springtime was looked
forward to a3 one of the great events of
the year. To be frozen in all the winter,
except for communication by stage once
or twice a week from the outside, and
then to have navigation opened for the
spring and summer rush were times not
to be forgotten by the people who lived
on the river. I remember one winter I
lived at Hudson, Wis.. on the Mississippi.
The river there usually froze over about
the 15th of November and remained in
that condition until around April 15. There
were no railroads, and the hauling of
freight for so many miles overland was
too difficult and the cost too great to be
thought of. Consequently we arranged in
the summer for the long winter seige. As
April came around the betting on the first
boat began. Talk about betting on Presi
dential elections. From a local standpoint
the Presidential election fever was noth
ing compared to that of the coming of the
first boat, because the arrival of the first
boat to get through the ice meant com
munication with the outside world and a
fresh supply of new things In the stores.
Everybody bet on the first boat, and lots
of money changed hands on the date."
In these days of lightning express
trains, autos and dirigible balloons It is
hard to realize that within the memory of
living men portions of the now populous
East were as shut oft from the world as
are some of the remote Alaskan cities
nowadays. Assistant Secretary of the
Treasury Taylor recently grew reminis
cent of early Wisconsin days to an East

The Flathead Indians on a Montana reservation have
revived the whipping post for certain offenses and have
found it to be notably of advantage. Perhaps the Flatheads,
casually observant of conditions among us, have recognized
the necessity of this institution and have decided not to wait
until they need it as badly as we do.
Now the galleries in the first and sec
ond class houses are well behaved and
the gods have retired to the wilderness of
the outlying theaters, where they still
exercise occasionally their time honored
prerogative of being judge and Jury of
the merits of the plays offered to their
criticism. ,
Often enough the criticism bestowed by
the gods was well deserved, and waa ex
pressed with so much good-natured wit
and irresistible humor that the rest of the
audience heartily enjoyed and appreciated
it, accepting it as one of the brightening
features of a sometimes dull performance.
At other times, however, when the godtt
were in an ugly mood, the manifestations
of their independent criticism were sea
soned with so much bitterness and accom
panied by such a display of rowdyism
that it became a disturbing factor, seri
ously interfering with the enjoyment of
the play by the lower parts of the house.
Attempts to suppress the gallery gods
were futile at first and only tended to
irritate and incite them, to more noisy
and disturbing demonstrations. Condi
tions became unbearable and in -the- end
the managers of houses catering to the
better classes found themselves facing tha
alternative of choosing between the gal
lery and the rest of their houses. It did
not take them long to make their choica
and the doom of the gallery god was
sealed.
The. gallery gods have had their .day.
says the Boston Herald, and the general
theater-going public will show little dis
position to regret that it has passed into
history. In the good, old times, when the
gallery gods ruled supreme, giving expres
sion to their approval or disapproval in
various ways characteristic to their tasta
and temporary mood, actors were In con
stant dread of Incurring the displeasure
of the topmost region of tile house.
Even men like Henry Irving, Edwin
Booth, Lawrence Barrett and Joseph
Jefferson were not spared by the gallery
gods, and many a time the effect of some
of their strongest and most impressive
scenes was destroyed by the pranks of thÂ«
gallery. ".''.,Â¦."â¢ . .
Passing of the God.
Thenceforward on the Journey the cap
tain was compelled to eat first from every
dish touched by the relatives of the elu
sive Filipino President, drank half of each
cup of water before his companions would
imbibe and smoke a portion of every
cigar which subsequently soothed the
tired brains of boy and grandmother on
their long trip to the metropolis. So
much haste did Captain Howland make
on his strange journey that he is always
known In the family of Aguinaldo as
"Senor Pronto" (the fast man). <,.-.
Captain Howland went to San. Fabian
in a hospital corps wagon and told Se
nora Fama of the wishes of the gTeat
"bianco general."
She readily consented to take the trip
and the party set out for Calaslao, whero
a special train was In waiting. The ofTl
cer soon observed that neither woman nor
child would eat or drink and he wa3
puzzled to find a cause for their strange
behavior. Coming to the hacienda of a
French mestizo near Dagupan, he told
the man of his troubles. The latter ex
plained that the senora must believ* that
the Americans wanted to poison her and
the child.
CAPTAIN CHARLES ROSCOE HOW
LAND, inspector of small arms
practice of the Department of Cali
fornia, tells an amusing story of the.dif
ficulties with which he was beset in tak
ing Senora Fama, mother of Aguinaldo,
from the province of Pangaslnan to Gen
eral Otis' headquarters In Manila in No
vember, 1S30.
The lady was accompanied by her four
year-old grandson, offspring of the illus
trious Insurrectionist.
"Just as they were about to turn away
to go to the next slab the Inquisitor man
let out a most dismal groan and sat up
on the slab with the sheet grasped about
his chin and his hÂ»ad wagging shaKily.
"Well, there w..s the most unearthly
yell from the fishermen. They all tried
to get out of the door at once. They left
two pipes and a cap' behind" them and the
way those sea boots hit that pavement
down Kearny street to the Barbary Coast
was something to dream about."
THEY had just brought in a "float
er" from the bay. The reporters
were sitting around the stove up
stairs in the Morgue waiting for some
body to come and identify the thing
downstairs on the slab.
"Reminds me of a good story," said
the old reporter.
"You remember the fellow who used
to be on the Inquisitor several years" ago
âhe got out of the business a while ago
and is making money nowâ tall, thin fel
low with a cadaverous face.
"Well, one very rainy day in the win
ter of '22, when I was on the Morgue and
police beat with him, â¢ they brought in
an ' Italian fisherman who had been
drowned in the bay. In order to identify
him the deputies went down to* Fisher
men's wharf and got a bunch of six or
eight Italians to come up to the Morgue
and view the body. The Inquisitor man
tipped off his hand to me and as the
fishermen hove in sight around the cor
ner he slipped down to the room below.
I told the deputy that since he was busy
I would take the Italians downstairs and
show them the body.
"I met the Italians and took them down
to the room. As they lumbered in with
their great sea boots stomping on the
Jloor each Dulled off his cap and crossed
himself. l' turned on the lights and there
on the first slab twith a sheet drawn up
to his chin and his cadaverous face drawn
and set, lay the Inquisitor man.
"I drew back, the curtains and they
gathered around in awesome silence.
Nov.', as you sit beside him. hold his wrist lightly in your hand (your hand be
ing above his) and raise his arm in a perfectly straight line about as high as hi3
head; then drop it, allowing it to fall as it will. This is the first exercise for relax
ation of the muscles.
Place the child at an ordinary table and be sure that the chair he occupies brings
him at the proper levelâ that Is, see that his arms are the same height in relation to
the table that they would be in regard to the keyboard were he seated at the piano.
His elbow should be about three inches above the table to allow a full sweep of
the arm, for we are going to use the table as an Imaginary keyboard Just at first,
until the child's flncers are in readiness for the piano. ' %
The first rtep Is to get the little hands ready to play.. The exercises I am going
to give.. for this preparing process are of the utmost importance and must be fol
lowed out in every detail, whether they seem to be necessary or not.
Now;Tor the lessons themselves:
Right here I wart to warn you that many people who know nothing of music
<or a very little, which is worse) will say: "What la the use of technique? It will
tend to make your child's playing mechanical!" They know not whereof they speak.
No tr-chnicrae ever made any on?% playing mechanical if properly applied, as every
cr:e who really understands the matter may see, for a knowledge of technique sim
ply makes one entirely Independent of technical difficulties, thereby giving the
pianist a chance to give full play to his musical feeling without Impediment.
â¢ â¢ â¢
And now one' last word to both parents
and children before we begin the lesson,;
Itself. Please believe that I am personally
intensely interested In each one of you, and as we work along together you cannot
be more anxious than I am that these lessons shall be of great benefit and that
thry will help ycu to look with knowing eyes into this great musical world that is
all around us. ....
(Sons Writer. Formcrlr Director of Music In the College of St John
the Baptist. New York.)
Â»T Is my purpose In these lessons to help children to
m gain a substantial knowledge of music In the shortest
M possible time, and In order to' do this I am going- to ask
both children and parents to co-operate with mo by giv
ing great attention, even to the smallest detail, and by mak
ing a perfectly fair trial of each exercise and, suggestion.
In my experience with children X hare found that the
precocious ones are not necessarily those who first reach
the goal; on the contrary, more often than" not, the chil
dren who hare been described to me as "slow" have proved
to be more successful musicians than those more brilliant,
- simply because the former have not had their precociousness
to depend upon, end have h*d to use patience, and perseverance in Its stead.
How a child may express himself In a truly musical way that will give pleasure
to others as weJl as himself is what I am going to explain in these lessons. For
mwlv if a child could "perform a little" (generally a few hymns) on "the Instru
ment"' (presumably a melodeon). he was considered to have mastered all that was
required of him in the musical line, and even now. In this enlightened age, if there
is any attempt at music in the home, it is apt to be of the tin pan variety, where
the principal aim of the performer seems to be to pound the poor, long-suffering
piano as loudly as possible, without the
least regard for tempo, rhythm, expres-v *
eion, or the lacerated sensibilities of the
listener, who has been polite enough to let
himself be beguiled into "hearing Georgie
play." ...
"Georgie," as a rule, is only too delight
ed to exhibit, but in spite of his willing
ness to "show oft," the moment he touches
the piano his fingers, wrists and arms be
come rigid from fright, and, having no
real foundation of technique or knowledge
of music to fall back upon, the result is
most disastrous. â¢' . Â¦ *
Now, all this can be avoided, and from
the very first a child may be taught to
gain entire control over his fingers and to
acquire the beautiful, clear, "singing, le
gato touch" In former times mastered only
by professional pianists, and that after
years and years of hajd study. Surely it
is worth trying for. Isn't it? Particularly
when it is right within our grasp and re
quires nothing but patient attention. Inter
est and, above all, practice.
The younger a child begins, the better,
always remembering to keep him interest
ed in the proceedings.

*Â£ Â¦ muÂ»r HESE Jag cures may be all right," said the old
â¢ â¢ W^ policeman on the beat, "but not for your Uncle
M Abner. Sort of eschew that kind of sledging for
me, as Tennyson remarks somewhere in his
pomes. In other words, cut it out.
"We were notified to look out for a boozomanlac from
one of these five-minute liquor cures the other night and
nearly all these gray hairs of mine are the result of it.
"I was standing on the corner when I sorter felt some
body behind me. I turned quickly and found a long, thin
guy with plenty of hair In his whiskers and a sort of hun
gry look in his bloodshot eyes and a cobblestone poised to
plunk me with.
" 'What are you going to do with that rock?' I asked.
" 'I have been commissioned to smite you,' says he. 'You
are one of the fallen angels.' ,
"Say, I was sure scared some. This fellow looked like a
cobra with muscular appliances to burp. I said to him,
kinder soft as it were, 'You've got the wrong dope. There ig a gazabo running
joint on the corner over there who is an Elijah without wings. Go over and muss
him up some and you will score a bullseye.'
"He took my advice and while he was crossing the street I rang in for the
wagon seven times. "When it arrived it took; four cops "and twenty citizens to con
trol the exhilarated gent. I lost an entire uniform.
"The funniest thing about It was that we found out this strenuous drunkard
was merely a prominent business man who had tried the jag cure and then scorned
it like a self-controlled man."
MR. LANE'S campaign is closing, as it began,, with
pyrotechnics in oratory. Himself a" partisan nomi
nee, in his latest speech he makes an appeal to non
partisanship for votes. In this appeal he lauded the Re
publican party and its illustrious leaders, known, he de
clared, for their genius and quality throughout the civilized
world, and "even in far Africa." ->uci
This geographical, globe-embracing argument and as
cription to the Republican party and its "great names will
no doubt suggest to Republicans that such a party is fit to
be intrusted with the government of San Francisco, where,
Mr. Lane admits, its voters and adherents are in a^najority.
If Ethiopia lift up her voice in praise of Republicans, San
Francisco should be willing to trust them to run her gov
ernment for two years.
Mr. Lane filed an explanation of his gray hairs, a sort
of plea in abatement, by declaring that he is only a boy in
politics, but that his election is necessary to put an end to
bossism in the city. Where are the bosses? Looking into
the literature of the campaign one boss is discovered. A
year ago he was revealed by Mr. Lane's morning organ, the
Examiner, which. refused to support Lane for Governor be
cause he was under Boss McNab. The McNab was then
presented by Mr. Hearst's paper as the most odious and
offensive boss that ever infested the town, the enemy of
labor; the foe of human peace, an epigrammatic monster
with the instincts of a cannibal and the predatory habits of
a bird of prey. Yet the hand of this kilted, curiosity in poli
tics was plainer in Lane's nomination for Mayor than when
he was nominated for Governor. Can the boss change his
tartan and swap his philabeg?
The same night that . Lane's oratory rolled around the
world from San Francisco *to the Dark Continent Mayor
Schmitz, who has developed oratory that runs neck "and
neck with Lane's, was using rhetoric as an art of persuasion
upon his fellow citizens in declaring that his is a fight for
the rights of the plain people, and that if elected he will
know no points of the compass; north and south will look
alike to him; he will cherish labor and capital as a hen
hovereth her chickens. He, too, asked his fellow citizens
to drop all partisanship and made a bid for Republican
votes. So at the Union Labor and Democratic corners of
the triangular fight the contest is a sort of auction. At
each the fact is recognized that the goods, the votes, are at
Crocker's . corner, in the hands of Republicans, and Lane
and Schmitz. bid against each other to get them.
â¢' This concession means that the decision of the contest is
with the Republicans of this city. If they resist the bids
and the blandishments of Schmitz and Lane, Crocker will
be Mayor. If they so stand, as present indications are
that they will, they will be joined by thousands of Demo
cratic and independent voters who are tired of hysterical
and hypnotic politics. They have seen the city govern
ment traded for unredeemed promises for\the last seven
years. .In the beginning 0/ that period they were told that
morally and politically San Francisco was in , a bad way
and the only medicine to set it right would be. found in
electing an anti-Republican Mayor. The bid was accepted
then, and has been accepted twice since, ftow they arc
told that the city is in a worse way than ever, and can" be
rescued only by again handing it over to the sarne rescue
party that, confesses to a three-ply failure.
The Digger Indians have a hard and fast rule about
doctors. When their medicine man makes three successive
failures to cure they save him from further chagrin by
taking him out in the chaparral and killing him. The
anti-Republican doctors who diagnosed the diseases of San
Francisco, and have had three chances at the patient, con
fess that they have three times failed. The people ought
to have as much sense as Digger Indians, and should
change doctors at least. No one will ask that they do
more than take the quack medicine men out into the man
zanitaand kill them politically. Physically we all wish
them well, and desire that they survive to enjoy good gov
ernment under Mayor Crocker and to rejoice with the rest
of us in the rise of that Greater San Francisco of which the
prophets have prophesied.
Mayor Schmitz says he wants to be elected Mayor for
the same reason that the United States went to war with
Spain, whatever that may mean. Lane cries, from the midst
of an attitude, "Let this be a non-partisan fight and give
San Francisco a government that all the world will point
to with pride and admiration," and appeals to his Repub
lican fellow citizens to have it so by electing him. Well,
please present the compliments of his Republican- fellow
citizens to all the world, as it stands ready and anxious to
point, with the information that they prefer to make San
Francisco the blushing object of. planetary attention .by
giving it Republican government under the leadership of
Mayor Croaker. Then in the seclusion of private life
Schmitz and Lane can settle their differenced as to which
was the incarnation of virtue, the avatar of a civic golden
age, and the heir at law of all the virtues.
THE country outside oi "the copper region of Mon
tana has heard with indifference the noisy litigation
long carried on there between rival interests claim
ing ownership in the rich deposits of the red metal. There
have Been decrees and counter decrees, charges of judicial
bribery and proceedings in impeachment; but now a de
cision seems to have been rendered by a district Judge
which includes all the" issues that were joined and con
cludes them, being the law in the case until it is reversed
by a higher court. , L ;
As Â£ result of this decision the party adverse, which
seems to have been in control of the properties, has closed
them all down, throwing out of employment many thou
sands of miners and other people supported in industries
collateral to copper mining, such as timbering, quarrying
limestone, burning brick, smithing and the many industries
necessary in the mining and smelting of the copper ores.
This has precipitated an industrial crisis upon Montana,
since it steps the earnings of the miners and the men in the
impinged occupations, and by shutting off the flow of money
for the necessaries of life into the channels of trade mate
rially abridges every activity of, the State.
Either the decision of Judge Clancy is good law or it is
npt. That can only be finally determined on appeal. To
an outsider it would seem the proper course for both par
ties to the. controversy to ask' the court to appoint a re
ceiver to take charge of and operate the property while the
several rival interests are undergoing final judicial ascer
tainment. The law cares for personal and property inter
ests in a manner consistent with the public peace when it
is properly invoked. Had a receiver been asked for and
appointed, the hullabaloo that is heard to the farthest
parts of the republic would not have been raised. Now,
however, the public peace is imperiled, and it is not pleasant
to read that the Judge who gave the decision has to have
a heavily armed bodyguard to protect him against the rage
of the idle miners. This can only mean that the Justices
of the Supreme Court will affirm his decision at their per
sonal peril, and raises a vision of the duress of justice in
that State that will not have a good effect upon its future
fortunes.
It must be said for the miners that they have offered
to buy the stock of the losers in the suit who are respon
sible for shutting down the mines, and a bank has offered
to furnish the money for that purpose. The price offered is
$500 per share, the par value being $100. To this Mr.
Heinze has replied with an offer to sell certain of the stock
at $200 and S35 per share, respectively, provided he is per
mitted to buy certain other stock at a price fixed by him
self. It seems, however, that the stock he wants is the cause
of the controversy, and his offer is declared to mean a
surrender of the rights of his rivals, which have been judi-'
cially confirmed. So that method of settling the issue is
abandoned. The police and guards are being doubled, and
the legal authorities are taking every precaution to protect
Surrounding States have an interest in the controversy,
since it may result in thirty thousand, miners and others
engaged in related industries leaving Montana to seek em
ployment in the other mining States, where the demand is
not eqijal to the absorption of so much labor. It is held
by lawyers who are disinterested that Judge Clancy's deci
sion is good law, and it remains to be seen whether prompt
action on appeal to the Supreme Court will bring peace
or war.

graÂ«r as! Â£ears7 xts, 5. 5". â¢ 4 _Jack Evans was given the decision over
Fred Turner In a four-round preliminary.
Weinig's wretched showing was a bit of
a surprise, for he apepared strong and
rangey along with his stocky opponent.
It was claimed for Welnig that he had
trained carefully and was In condition.
Millet, who Is one of the most promising
men of his weight in the country, took all
the fight out of him with ' one terrific
punch.
Referee Eddie Smith disqualified Jack
Carter In the fifth round of the go with
George Brown of the West Oakland Ath
letic Club. Carter acted as If he were
in a trance and made no pretense at fight
ing. After much warning the referee
stopped the farce.
Welnig wobbled to the center when the
second round was called and for a min
ute divided the time between sprawling
on the floor, clinching and trying to get
Inside Millet's punches. The last time the
Buffalo lad went to the mat he was count
ed out. Half at himself, Welnig tried to
finish the -round with his second. "Dixie
Kid," but he was quickly hustled out of
the ring. Dave Barry was also behind
Weinig. Millet was assisted by "Spider"
Kelly, Charlie Grlswold and Frank Ma
rino.
Welnlg did not show to advantage. He
could not stop the stiff punches from Mil
let and he did not offer to lead once dur
ing the brief engagement. Millet started
with a heavy onslaught of straight rights
and lefts to head and body that put his
tall antagonist to the floor four times be
fore the bell tapped the close of the first
three minutes.
In fact, Joe, did the trick with one punch
in the first round before the echo of the
opening gong had fairly died away. He
handed "Welnlg a heavy one on the Jaw
that sent the ex-cyclist to the floor and
left him dazed .until the finishing touches
came In the first minute of the second
round.
Joe Millet disposed of Al Welnlg, thÂ«
Buffalo boxer, last night at the Reliance
Club, Oakland, In the second round of a
scheduled fifteen-round, event.
Tall, angular and lithe and llght-com
plexioned was Johnson, while McVey,
dark, stocky, muscular and smaller, it
looked like a chocolate cream be!r.g In
troduced to a ton of coal. In the first
round Johnson floored McVey and th*
lead he picked up at that time Tvas never
relinquished. In the sixth round Johnson
placed another knockdown to his credft.
Johnson fought cautiously, as he always
does, taking no chances. Time after
time he stung McVey's face with left
Jabs until the latter's countenance looked
like a toy rubber face that can be distort
ed by pressure of the fingers, and again
and again he rocked the Oxnard man
with hard rights, but could not put him
out. McVey put up a plucky, uphill fight.
but was outgeneraled, outboxed and out
classed, and Referee Eyton's decision waa
received without a dissenting murmur.
F. E. MULHOLLAND.
Â¦'LOS ANGELES, Oct. 27.â Before thÂ»
largest crowd that ever witnessed a box-
Ing contest In this city Jack Johnson wa.*
awarded the decision at the end of twenty
rounds to-night over Sam McVey of Ox
nard at Hazard's Pavilion. The men met
under the auspices of the Century Club
and at noon to-day President McCary
said the receipts showed Xhero would bÂ«
fully an $8500 house. The fighters were
guaranteed a $4000 purse, of which part
the winner takes 60 and the loser 40 per
cent. A belt emblematic of the colored
heavy-weight championship of the world
given by Billy Roche, manager of Mc-
Vey. also want to the winner. Early in
the evening scalpers were obtaining {4
and $5 for $3 seats, but later there was a
slump and the curbstone speculators were
glad to get rid of their tickets at $150.
The betting closed with Johnson favorite
at odds of 100 to 80 and several thousands
changed hands over the result. The bis
structure was Jammed from pit to dome.
Every colored person that goes to swell
the population and who possessed tne
price was there. The two huge galleries
were dotted with members of the dark
race until they resembled Josephine
Sabel's pickaninny music score.
The arrangements were perfect After
two preliminaries. In which young Joseph
belted Kid Long around until the referee
gave him the verdict, and Burt Palmer
was awarded the decision over Tom Ja
cobs on a foul, the ring was cleared for
the two big colored men. At 8:50 McVey
entered the ring. He had in his corner
Billy Roche, Frank Fields and Denver
Ed Martin. Ten minutes later Jack
Johnson followed. He was looked after
by Australian Tim Murphy. Solly Smith.
Mike Shaughnessy and Kid Solomon.
Charley Eyton of the Burbank Theater
refereed the go. Shortly after 9 o'clock
the two fighters shook hands and posed
for a flashlight picture and there was a
marked contrast in their appearance.
Special Dispatch to Tha Can.
MEMPHIS, Tenn.. Oct. 27.â Dan Patch,
1:56};, within forty-flve minutes' elapsed
time this afternoon, smashed two world's
records in succession on the track of the
; Memphis Trotting Association. First he
: went against the world's half-mile pacing
record of :57Vi, held by Prince Alert. He
clipped a second and a half from this,
pacing the distance in :56 flat. Next he
hung out a new world's record for a nvle
pacing to .a wagon, making the mile in

of 1:59*4 he made at the recent meeting on
the Lexington, Ky., track, the world's

where two runners to sulkies were picked
up. The quarter was made in :28>4 'and
the pacer dashed under the wire with
the hands of the timers' watches sharp
on the mark of :56. The demonstration
from the grand stand was quite as en
thuslasfic as those given Dan Patch
when he set the pacing mile record of
1:56^ and Lou Dillon when she trotted a
mile In 1:58^6. These noisy acclamations
of the new champions were all emphasized
by the enthusiasm of the spectators
when Dan Patch came upon the Hack
again, this time to set a new wagon
mark for the mile. The quarter wa's m:ule
in :23Va. . the half in :58}i and the three
quarters in 1:2S. Under the wire the
champion pacer dashed in 1:57U. showing

Featherweight Champion Punches
Him Into Submission Quickly.
BOSTON, Oc,t. 27.â For ten rounds and
a minute and a half In . the eleventh
Hughey Murphy of New York stood up
against Youne Corbett to-night, putting
up a clever defense and landing many
blows on the feather-weight champion.
Then came three blows In quick succes
sion and, although Murphy came up be
fore the count, he was bo groggy that
Corbett refused to punish hlm_ unneces
sarily and was awarded the decision. Al
though Murphy besides evading many of
Corbett's blows landed frequently, his
punches had but little power behind them
and Corbett scarcely noticed them.
In the eleventh round Cornett started In
to get the decision and rushed the battle
from the start. At the end of a minute
he landed a solar plexus blow, on Murphy
and followed It up with a left on the
chin.i sending the New Yorker to the floor
until the referee counted nine. Murphy
arose to continue the battle, but was too
groggy. Corbett landed another left on
the chin. Murphy went across the ropes
and lay there for another count of nine.
He got up before counted out, but Cor
bett, noticing his condition, refused to
continue the fighting and the decision was
given to thu Denver man.
Murphy then fell his length on the floor
and Corbett picked him up and carried
him to his corner.

CHICAGO. Oct. 27.â Our Bessie glad
dened the hearts of the. plkeTS in the
fourth race at Worth to-day, a handicap
at one and an elchth miles, which the
won by a neck from Bondage In a sen
sational finish. Our Bessie, always heav
ily backed, was pounded trom 8 to 2 to
3 to 1 to beat the 6 to 5 favorite, Bondage,
and she delivered the goods handsomely.
Our Bessie was off flying, while Bond
age and Dr. Stephens were all tangled up
and for a time it looked as though one
or the other 'would be thrown. Taking
advantage of this handicap Ferrell sent
Our Bessie along, leading all the way.
Rounding the far turn Our Bessie In
creased her lead and Bondage moved up
fast and got into second place in the
stretch. He was expected to run over
Our Bessie at the end, t>ut the same
little mare would not give way to him
and under a strong ride by Ferrell won
by a nose. ,
Tokalon was the only winning favorite.
Ferrrtl rode three winners. The. day
was clear, the card exceptionally good
and a large crowd was In attendance.

The California varsity football team de
feated an eleven composed of alumni on
the Berkeley gridiron yesterday by a
score of 6 to 0 in a sort of burlesque foot
ball same. Neither side tried to play
hard.
There were several good plays, how
ever, by both teams. Hall and Greisberg
twice fooled the varsity men with over
head passes after being tackled. Kaars
berg, another veteran, did some excellent
line bucking. Overall made several punta
of more than forty yards and hit the
line like a ton of brick whenever he was
given the ball.
The varsity backs continually violated
one of the first principles of football in
attempting to make detours when about
to be tackled. The Interference was good.
The line showed remarkable strength, al
though the ends do not get down the
Held fast enough on punts. The backs are
speedy and are bound to make a fine
showing in the big game. Every player
on the team tackles low and almost in
variably stops his man.
. The varsitv kicked over on the start
and the alumni sent the ball back to the
middle of the field from the 25-yard line.
The varsity advanced the ball about
twenty yards- and fumbled. The alumni
fumbled In turn and the university team
got the ball.
The opposing elevens seesawed back and
forth across the field for a few minutes
and finally the alumni were forced back
to their 10-yard line. After two or three
line plunges, Snedigar was sent through
the alumni right tackle for a touchdown.
Overall kicked the goal.
The ball did not get close to either goal
line during the remainder of the half.
Demeritt of the varsity got through clev
erly and blocked a kick just before the
whistle blew.
During the second half both teams fum
bled frequently and were penalized for
offside play. The varsity did not attempt
to advance the ball by rushes to any
considerable extent but played mostly on
the defensive. This gave Overall plenty
of opportunity to show his art as a pun
ter. The line-up follows:

The football game between the Chemawa
Indians of Oregon and the Stanford var
sity will be played on Wednesday after
noon on the Stanford campus. For next
Saturday Treasurer Cowden has arranged
a final game .with the. Reliance eleven,
'also to be played on the campus. The last
preliminary game of the season will be
the contest with the Multnomah Club on
November 7 on the Stanford field. Since
this game is to be played but a week be
fore , the : intercollegiate, ana the Multno
mah team is reported a strong aggrega
tion, a good line ought to be gained as to
Stanford's possibilities in the big game.
Coach Lanagan was visibly and con
fessedly disgusted with the showing made
by hi a men against Nevada. To use his
expression, "Nevada outplayed us at
every point of the game."

RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
The Cripples wanted to lose the game
on the Oakland field so badly- yesterday
afternoon that they simply threw It
away at every chance. There was really
no other reaspn why they should have
lost, for, old Phil Knell was a pie to hit,
while Cooper had one of his good days.
Anyhow, Mike Fisher got away with the

The Morgan, with the whalers Califor

cane which in January swept the islands
of the Paumotu group with such traglo
results. The three whalers left Dominic,
of the Marquesas group, on the afternoon
of January 12, and at 7 a. m. of the day
following the hurricane burst on them.
It continued eleven days, blowing the
whalers hundreds of miles out of their
course and inflicting damage on all the
vessels. Each of the trio lost two boats.
The California had some of her bulwarks
carried away, and the Morgan's Jlbboom
was broken.
A whale that was chased on July 4 came
to the surface under the stern of one of
the Morgan's boats, and all on board had
a lively swim for life. The after-end of
the whaleboat was smashed to slivers,
but the crew managed to keep afloat until
their shipmates in other boats picked

While spending his vacation at home
In Covelo he went hunting and came
across two fine bucks in an opening. He

other also fell. The second deer ap

Lang straddled it and proceeded to cut
its throat. The deer, however, had been
only stunned. It Jumped up with the hunt
er on its back, knocking the knife out
of his bands by the sudden move, and
plunged down the hillside. Toung Long
grabbed the animal's horns and bung on.
Finally in passing a redwood the hunt
er managed to turn the deer's head by
pulling his horns and guided him Into the
tree at full speed. Deer and hunter went
down together. Long was badly bruised
and the deer had broken his neck. Young
Long managed to get both deer into Co

The win of the first division of the
seven furlong selling fracas by Thlsbe at
the astounding odds of 20 to 1 created a
ripple of excitement in otherwise quiet
turf circles. No such thing has been
heard of before at the meeting. Kunz
got the mare away in front and though
staggering at the finish she beat Loyal S
over the line a nose. Grail ran third,
only a neck farther away. Tullett on
Polonlue got lost In the discard.
Another top-heavy favorite took the
count in the two-year-old scramble at
four and a half furlongs. This time It
happened to be Barney Schreiber's filly
Eugenia B, quoted at 1 to 2. L. Spencer
succeeded in getting her away poorly and
she finished a distant second to Pat Bul
ger, a 7 to 1 Bhot, with Hilderbrand in
the saddle. The show went to Annie
Marie.
A big bunch of cheap ones went to the
post in the second seven furlong affray,
with Tlzona' a 4 to 5 favorite. Dr. Worth
made all the running and should have
won had Waterbury not allowed Hender
son to get through on the ins!de with
the favorite and score by a nose. The
erratic brute Malplagnet was thrown soon
after the start, little Lewis fortunately
escaping Injury.
About the best race of the meeting
was the sixth, a six furlong run, wherein
were Colonel Van, Tower of Candles, Best
Man and Constellator. Tower of Candles
closed a 4 to 5 choice and had her colors
lowered. The mare made all the running,
with Powell on Colonel Von close in her
wake. At the stand she grew tired and
Colonel Van passed her, winning by half
a length in 1:13. Best Mark also closed
strong, finishing lapped on the two lead-

In a paper on immigration as it affects
the public health Dr. A. J. McLaughlin,
assistant surgeon, marine hospital serv
ice, declared that the real danger lay In
that class of immigrants whose physique
was much below the American standard,
whose employment is in the sweatshop,
and whose residence is the eastside tene
ments in New York City.
There was a general discussion of the
subject of car ventilation, the consensus
of opinion being that the air in sleeping
cars becomes vitiated and- that they are
fruitful sources of disease. The delegates
were outspoken In condemnation of the
alleged lack of attention, to the matter of
cleaning blankets and furnishings In
sleeping cars. Dr. J. H. McCormlck of
the State Board of Health of Kentucky
declared that official investigation into
the subject made by him disclosed the fact
that the blankets were cleaned only
once every six months.
report of the committee on the
cause or prevention of infant mortal
ity was read by Dr. Henry Mitchell,
chairman of the State Board of Health,
Asbury Park, N. J. The remarkable dim
inution in the number of deaths among
Infants during the past ten years, he said,
has been by many ascribed to the recog
nition by medical practitioners of the ad
vantages which attend cleanly methods In
the collection, storage and preparation of
cows' milk for Infants who are artificially
fed. The deaths from diphtheria have di
minished. Measles and whooping cough
have varied but little in their periodical
recurrence. The measures regarded as
most promising for a further reduction
of tho mortality among infants, the com
mittee said, are the more general adop
tion of cleanly methods in the collection,
cooling and handling of cows* milk; the
abolishment of breeding places for fllea
near dwellings and their exclusion from
contact with food: the erection of im
proved tenements in cities and the effec
tual Isolation of all cases of communi
cable diseases.
The report of the committee on animal
diseases In food, having reference to the
phase of tuberculosis which relates to its
transmission from the animal to human
beings, was presented by Director D. B.
Salmon of the Bureau of Animal Industry,
Washington. D. C. Clinical evidence,
statements and experimental tests, he de
clared, all favor the conclusion that bo
vine tuberculosis was a factor in human
tuberculosis. The source of the milk sup
ply, he said, should be carefuly attend
ed to.

Pius Designates Entire
Western Hemisphere
as American.
May Not Include United
States In Creation of New
Cardinals.
BOMB, Oct. 27.â Some time after the
recent conclave the Vatican was sur
prised at a report from the United States
that a high prelate of the church there
had spoken repeatedly of the possibility
of several Americans being nominated
Cardinals. As the good faith of the pre
late In question could not be doubted It
was supposed that he was laboring un
der a misapprehension. His apparent
mistake can easily be explained. Euro
peans generally and Italians in particu
lar use the term "American" as applying
equally to Canadians, citizens of tha
United States and South Americans.
According to this custom therefore, even
if the Pope, who does not speak Eng
lish, mentioned his Intention to create
several American Cardinals, he did not
mean that they should come exclusively
from the United States.
The whole of Central and South Amer
ica, with a Catholic population of over
60,000.000, never had a Cardinal. Brazil,
the largest of the I/atln-Amertcan coun
tries, has repeatedly asked for a Cardinal.
It is probable that the Archbishop of.
Bio ds Janeiro will be the first South
American prelate 'to be raised to the pur
ple: but if this is done it will then be dif
ficult to refuse the same favor to Mexico,
and even more difficult not to extend tha
privilege to the Archbishops of Buenos
Ayres, Argentine and Santiago. Chile.
It has been suggested. In order to make
room for new Cardinals, to reduce tha
Cardinals In those countries which do not
seem to be sufficiently appreciative of tha
privilege, as, for Instance, France, which
normally has seven Cardinals.
The suggestion also has been mada to
continue the system inaugurated by Leo
XIII to bring about a better balanco be
tween the numbers of foreign and Italian
Cardinals.
In tha "United States there are several
Archbishops whose high attainments) fit
them to enter the Sacred College. Arch
bishop Ryan of Philadelphia is consid
ered first among these, but the situation
Is such that not only the personality of
the man to be selected must be consid
ered, but also the Importance- of tha geo
graphical situation of the archdiocese.
For Instance, if a new Cardinal wera to
be named the relative importance of Phil*
adelphla. New York, Chicago and St.
Louis must be taken into consideration,
as. owing to their positions in the Catholic
world, any one of them would btÂ» worthy
to be the se* of tha new prince of tha
church.
According to opinion prevailing at tha
Vatican It is not likely that in the next

1 Captain Mclntyre Slips Ashore From
Chico and Avoids Making State
ment About Wreck.
Captain James Mclntyre. master of the)
wrecked steamer South Portland, arrived
this morning shortly after midnight on
the steamer Chico.
Quite a number of people had gathered
on the dock to await the arrival of the>
commander of the lost ship, but he man
aged to slip ashore without any one see-
Ing him and must have jumped onto tha
dock from the stern of the steamer be
fore her gangplank was put out. He evi
dently did not care to be seen or to make
any statement regarding his extraordi
nary conduct on the night of the loss of
his ill-fated vessel. At any rate, ha
somehow contrived to reach the dock
and disappear without being seen by any
one on shore.
Besides Captain Mclntyre. the Chico
brought the following named survivors of
the SÂ«vHh Portland: James Ward, chief

WARM GREETING
FOR NORDICA
Duss' Orchestra Scores
a Most Brilliant
Triumph.
Fashionable Audience En
joys Splendid Programme
at the Alhambra.
One longr triumph was the concert given
by the Metropolitan Opera-house orches
tra at the Alhambra last night Folk,
musical and fashionable, everybody was
there, with appetites and enthusiasm at
grand opera pitch. Xordlca, soloist of the
evening, came In for a welcome that sane
Itself Into an epic of victory In her "Dich
Theure Halle," and the . orchestraâ such
an orchestra!â evoked a fine enthusiasm.
J. H. Dun, who' made his first local bow
at the desk last .night, also came In for
a generous welcome.
The enthusiasm was as remarkable as
was the whole concert The affair, owing
to the eccentricities of special trains, did
not begin until 9 o'clock, but this did not
in the least dampen matters. And though
-some few people, left before the close â
well after 11 o'clockâ the concert ended
with regret to the rest The orchestra
Itself, that had been traveling around
from 6:30 o'clock in the morning and was
fresh from an exacting programme at
Palo Alto In the afternoon, cams with
extraordinary spirit to its task.
One cannot I but wish one had an or
chestra like this of Mr. Duss to play on.
It seems no trouble at all. Plays itself,
apparently. And it would be a sheer de
light to listen to in anything. How can
one describe the beauty of the brass, the
round, golden note of it? There Is a
young trumpeter doing the thing Impos
sibleâhe did in the "Parsifal" excerpt,
and two worthy fellows of his. Again,
the horns are gloriousâ the first of them
got his chance in the "Norwegienne Rhap
sodle," the trombones, too. Fine strings
again, finely led by Mr. Franko, concert
master, and a choir of woodwind that
satisfies wholly. One listens now here,
now there, with pleasure in the simple
tonal beauty, no matter what Is said, and
there was much said in last night's pro
gramme worth listening to. The orches
tra is wonderfully balanced and respon
sive to its last member.
Mr. Duss, the new leader. Is a pic
turesque sort of person of marked Indi
viduality and graceful presence. He !a
modest in his leadership, which, with an
orchestra that needs little, is a "virtue in
itself. They do the light thins and Mr.
Duss gracefully permits them to do it.
One should be grateful, and is, to the
conductor for this.
Among numbers new here on the pro
gramme â rich' In noveltyâ was - a delight
ful "Suite Norwegienne," by Hallen.
skillfully made, characteristic In color and
original in theme.
It is among, the most charming things
lately heard here. Elpar's coronation
march "With Pomp and Circumstance,"
Is a dashing movement, splendid in its
pompous s-wintr, and the "Parsifal Vor
spiel" was another notable novelty, with
some delicious moments in a rather
wondering movement Weingartner's ar
rangement of the Weber "Invitation to
the Waltz" proved a scholarly and thor
oughly musical transcription, and the
Ooldmark "Vorsplel" was also very pleas
ing. Other numbers were the Tschai
kowaky "Overture Solennelle," and the
Massenet "Vorsplel" from "Herodiade."
also new. The numbers were frequently
encored, the leader generously responding.
Xordlca has perhaps never been in bet
ter voice than last evening. There is not
a trick of singing that she has not, and
one got them all last night She sang the
"LJebestad," from "Tristan and Isolde,"
In miraculous, dazzling fashion, as daz
zling as Mme. Nordlca looked, which is
saying everything. Orchestra, audience,
everything faded while she sang into a
forgotten background for the most won
derful love song ever made.
The singer was uproariously encored and
generously compiled with the imperious
demand. Not less radiantly intelligent
was her "Dleh Theure Halle," into which
she soared full-voiced and spirited at
once â and It's a tremendous thing to do!
Mme. Nordlca was sympathetically ac
companied in these by the orchestra, and
on her encores. Schumann, Strauss, Grieg,

has developed greatly since his last visit

The fruit market was amply supplied with
most descriptions and trade was quiet, as
local requirements were moderate and there
was very little â¢doing In the shipping . line.
Apples continued to arrive ! freely from all
growing sections and thÂ» movement in fancy
stock continued fair. Occasional lots of some
varieties commanded a small premium over
the quoted rates, but $1 was the top for. the
general run of fancy stock. The lower grades
were abundant and were net wanted at any
price. Fancy Pears and Quinces were in good
request at full figure*, but trashy stock, which
was .abundant, moved slowly. A few small
consignments of Flus were received and were
quickly disposed of at good figures. Pome
granates. Persimmons and Plums were plenti
ful and showed little change. The demand for
table Grap*s was less active than on thÂ» pre
ceding day and prices of small packages
ranged lower The toD quotation for large
boxes was considered an extreme figure for
strictly fancy lots of the Muscat variety, which
were in rather small supply.
Receipts cf Strawberries and Raspberries
were more liberal than on the preceding day
and prices were lower, with surplus stock
going to the canners at the Inside quota
tion. Huckleberries - and Cranberries ruled
firm under light eurjplles. Citrus and Tropi
cal fruits were plentiful and unchanged. New
crop Navel Oranges and Grape Fruit were of
fering at $4 and $3 per box respectively, but
moved slowly owing to their greenness.

total. 17.S29 tons. Although the arrivals from
the colonies have been only rtx ships, still the
liberal deliveries last month have filled up sll
local requirements for Newcastle coals. ThÂ«
chartered list from Sydney and Newcastle
foots up twenty-nine Teasels, twenty-seven of
which are already on way. The carrying- ca
pacity of the vessels engaged Is 83.0CO tons; In
June last the chartered list was seventy-eight
vessels, with a capacity of 233.0CO tons. Thesa
figures show a shrinkage of shipments from
Australia within the pa?* four months of 150,-
C00 tons, and but few names are being added
I to the loading 11.- 1 at present, as the asking
rates of freight are higher than Importers can
afford to pay. It Â»s very evident ' that the
quantities of coal to be consumed locally this
year will be fully 2C0.0C0 tons less than in
180C. clearly demonstrating that fuel oil is
making furthw inroads Into the consumption
of coal. There iÂ» little change In the selling
price since last mall. The values of fuel for
domestic use are being well malctainÂ«d. TtÂ»e>
quantity being consumed will be largely In

NEW YORK. Oct. 27. â About the time when
professional ODerators were ia the midst of
their selling to take profits on the considerable
advance of jest?niay and to-day Wail street
was alarmed with rumors of rtnaneial troubles
In St. Louis. This had the effect of ac
ce-ntuattn^ tn* .incdiaatian to sell. Statements
were i*it>il<hed J>elore tbe closing that ejme
pf tte smaller cia;s cf deÂ»ot<ltO'rs . had taken
fright r.nd were withdrawing clex>-.Â«lts from
.Â«ocne of the banks and treat comrmnfes in St.
L<ouis. but expressions- of cenfid^nce Â¦ were
qattÂ»4 -that '-no !.-ajt:i would result -to the in
stitutions affected. The xlcelng of the stock
market wa* in consequence lalrly steady, al
though the earlier advances were generally
wlwd out and net losses were the rule at
the close. It was obvious from the outset
that the considerable demand for stocks was
being freely fed for purposes of proflt-taking.
It is difficult to pay, therefore, how far the
St. Louis development may have b^en respon
sible for the reaction. Sentiment in Wall
street is sensitive over the question of trust
company conditions and even Â»o Â«nudl an in
cident as the report of a run on a country
bank in Wisconsin, which was started by a
rumcr that the bank hod been i-vtstinz in
railroad securities, was made the subject of
discussion as an Illustration of publtc dis
quiet engendered by banking operations of this
sort. But the reactionary tendency of the
market was caoable of other explanations.
Fcr one thing, the very small outsldo demand
attracted by the advance managed by profes
sionals served aÂ» a warning to taat class of
operator* to restrict their ventures. The dom
inant inffuence of the movement if Amalga
mated Copper on the market also shifted t.}
the side of reaction to-day. The cpen public
discussion between the parties to the Montana
copper quarrel made it evident this morning
that the proposals for arbitration did net
offer a probable outcome. The market for raw
copper also slipped back slightly from yes
terday's spasmodic advance. The opening price
t.f Amal Kama ted was the highest at a shade
under a point over last night and the stock
closed at a net Ic5s of nearly a point. . This
movement was quite decisive In snapingj pro
fessional sentiment on the whole market. A
considerable part of the early ne'Iin* was
credited to London account. The day's heavy
outgo of currency to various pointy was an
other factor of reaction. In the day's total
iranrfers through- the sub-treasury of $1,150,
<JuO there wÂ«s $e50.0n0 sent to New Orleans.
$300.0uO to Chicago and $200,000 to St. Louis.
News from Chicago was of large withdrawals
from there by country banks and New York
exchange at that point fell to 75 cents discount.
This probably marks a beginning of the West
ern crop moving. Tlje local money market
was inclined to fellow the stock market. At
the same time sterling exchan*<Â» yielded.
Large offers of cotton bills helped this result.
London's favorable attitude to this market
was due to the beginning of the Stock Ex
change settlement, which revealed a consid
erable short account In Americans.
There was a continued good absorption of
bonds, but some of the more speculative issues
rÂ»act<Hi in sympathy with stocks. Total sale',

Pease and Rumble have conspired to de
fraud the stockholders. He says that for
the purpose of inducing further invest
ments in the concern thÂ«y have used to
pay dividends part of $200,000 he alleges
was received by them for the sale of 150,
000 shares of stock and that they have
converted the balance of the money to
their own use. He says further that

CHARGES FRAUD
AGAINST RUMBLE
The selection of Mr. Snell as manager
of the Monterey resort will meet with
public favor in that he is highly regarded
by travelers and is a man of exceedingly
pleasing manners. Mr. Snell . has been
manager of the Hotel' Vendome at San
Jose thirteen years, during which he has
succeeded In getting it out of a rut and
placing it on a paying basis, a fact that
was fully appreciated by the stockhold
ers, who, through Mr. Snell's efforts,
were finally relieved of the disagreeable
necessity of paying assessments.'
It was his success at the Vendome, to
gether with his long and creditable man
agement of the Lick House, that sug
gested his name to Manager Shepard of
the Pacific Improvement Company, when
he began to look around for a new man
ager for the Hotel del Monte.
George P. Snell, one pi the best known
hotel men on the coast, who, for a num
ber of years was manager of the Lick
House of this city, has just accepted the
management of the Hotel del Monte at
Monterey. His appointment to his new
position Is the result of several weeks*
correspondence and a number of confer
ences between himself and A. D. Shep
ard, general manager of. the Pacific Im
provement Company, which owns the Ho
tel del Monte and several other estab
lishments of a similar character in this
State.
Is Appointed to Take Charge of the
Big Establishment at
Monterey.

Bexmingham Not to Resign.
Captain John Bermlngnair, supervising
inspector of steam vessels at this port.
has pone to Washington, X). C, for the
purpose of consulting 1 with President
Roosevelt on matters affecting the ser
vice on this coast. It was reported a shÂ«rt
time ago that Captain Bermingham would
If obliged to resign his office because of
the pressure of his private business, and
about a dozen aspirants for the office pre
sented their recommendations for appoint
ment. But United States Inspector John
K. Bulger Is authority for the statement
That Captain Bermingham will not re
sipn, tie having- been Induced to recon
sider his determination by representa
tives of the most important shipping in
terests of the roast.
Must Close on Election D&y.
Chief of Police Wittman had a notice
sent yesterday to each holder of a license
to sell liquor notifying them that at a
meeting of the Police Commissioners on
October 20 a resolution was passed to the
effect that the selling, giving away or fur
nishing of spirituous or malt liquors, wine
or any other Intoxicating beverage on
next election day by any person or per
sons prohibited from so doing by the act
of March 4, 1874, would be a sufficient
cause for the revocation of his or their
permit to sell liquor. The Chief added
that any one violating the act would be
vigorously prosecuted, besides having the
permit revoked.
Dr. J. Mclvor-Tyndall gave interesting
testimony before Judge Cook yesterday
In the divorce suit of Crissy McAllon
against C. J. McAllon as to the condition
of a person's mind when under hypnotic
influence. \
Mrs. McAllon while under examination
last Friday testified, that McAllon had
hypnotized, her repeatedly and while in
that condition he made her do silly
things, such as fish for trout In a cus
pidor and eat soap, believing it to bo
candy. While in that condition he had
taken her to San Jose on January 18. 19C1,
where they were married. Her s's*ttr,
Mrs. T. J. Smith, corroborated her and
testified that she had also been hynotized
by McAllon. /
The Judge had continued the case till
yesterday, as he wanted some expert tes
timony on the question of hypnotism, and
Dr. Melvor-Tyndall was subpenaed by the
attorney for the plaintiff. In answer to
the Judge, Dr. Tyndall said that a woman
under a hypnotic spell, If the suggestion
were made to her to get married, would
get in that line of thought and no one
could tell by her actions or demeanor that
she was under such a spell. She would
not know herself what had happened till
the spell was removed by some other test.
In the early stages a person could re
member anything that had happened, but
the case was different when under a deep
spell. He had seen the plaintiff and said
she would make an easy subject.
Â¦ In the ne-antime Mrs. Colvln keeps In
retirerrent ilr Oakland. Her husband ls
indignant at the notoriety achieved by
his wife and he is determined to either
secure the return of his wife's Jewels or
their value. Failing In this he insists that
a criminal prosecution will follow against
the persons who were with his wife last
Thursday night.
The reputation of Heymans Is not of
the best, according to statements made by
Detective Ryan, who has charge of Mrs.
Colvin's case. Heymans has posed as a
"doctor" and was arrested in September,
1902,. for practicing without a license.""- He
had a suite of offices In this city and ad
vertised extensively. Owing to a technical
ity Heymans was acquitted of the charge
brought against him.
Mrs. Colvin admitted to the. detectives
that- she had met Christopher and Hey
mans at the race, track four years ago and
that they were "no good." Mrs. Borland
also informed the officers that the two
men "did not amount to much."
The husband of Mrs. Colvln called upon
Captain of Detectives Martin yesterday
and stated that the missing Jewels had
not been returned and that no cash set
tlement had been made for them. Colvin
Btated that i'C would allow the matter to
go for a. day or two and if by that tine
no satisfactory settlement was made his
wife would swear out warrants for the
arrest of Mr**. Borland, Christopher and
Heymnns.
HUSBAND IS INDIGNANT.
Captain of Detectives Martin informed
Mrs. Colvin that he would arrest the
persons who had been In the room If she
j would swear to a complaint. Mrs. Col
; vln declined to do so. saying that she
I did not desire any publicity and would
try s to secure the return of her missing
jewels.
Mrs. Borland then Informed the Captain
of Detectives that she would pay Mrs.
Colvln for the missing brooch and^pln,
but not for the ring, which she-insisted
must hav"e been taken by Heymans. Â£<
j Mrs. Borland thtn claimed that she
j went for a drive In Heymans' buggy and
! that her companion was Christopher.
I "When at a roadhouse near the beach Mrs.
I Borland opened her purse to pay for some
drinks and she says that she found, that
the Jewels and $17 of her own money were
missing. She accused Christopher of rob
bing her and insisted upon searching him,
but she could not find the jewels or money
she claimed to have missed. Mrs. Bor
land denied that she had taken a diamond
j ring from the finger of Mrs. Colvin while
the latter was unconscious, but admitted
that she had seen the ring upon Mrs. Col
vin's hand when she left the room. Mrs.
Borland informed the police that if Mrs.
Colvin had lost her ring Heymans must
have taken It.
Heymans made a statement, to the po
lice and denied that he had taken Mrs.
Colvln's ring, and accusations passed be
tween Mrs. Borland, Christopher and
! Heymans. \
According to the story told by Mrs. Col
vln numerous drinks were served in the
rooms of Mrs. Borland and her mother,
Mrs. Moore, last Thursday night. After
a time Mrs. Colvin complained of a severe
headache and Heymans suggested that he
would go to a drug store and get a head
ache powder. Heymans. accompanied by
Christopher, went to a drug store to get
the powder and on their return it was
given to Mrs. Colvln. She claims that she
became unconscious and while in that
condition she was robbed of a diamond
marquise ring, a diamond brooch and a
diamond pin, the total value of the gems
being $300.
The matter was reported to the police
last Thursday night and Detective Ryan
was placed upon the case. He went to
the house and could only find Mrs. Colvin
and Mrs. Moore, the mother of Mrs. Bor
land. Mrs. Colvin was positive in her
statements at that time she had been
drugged and robbed of her Jewels.
On Friday last Detective Ryan suc
ceeded In finding all the persons who
had been in Mrs. Borland"s rooms during
the previous evening and they were taken
before Captain of Detectives Martin.
Mrs. Borland claimed that her friend.
Mrs. Colvln. had been taken ill and that
Heymans had administered a "headache,
powder" to her. Mrs. Borland admitted
that in order to revive Mrs. Colvin she
had unfastened the dress of the*unÂ£pn

ROBBED WHILE DRIVING.
Claiming that ehe wm drugged and
robbed of a portion of her Jewels while
visiting the rooms of a friend, Mrs.
Charles â¢ L. Colvln, wife of a prominent
attorney of Oakland, has enlisted the aid
of the Police Department. There has been
considerable effort to hush up the details
of the case, and, while no arrests have
been made, it is likely that the whole af
fair will be aired in the Police courts.
Mrs. Colvln claims that last Thursday
evening she called at the rooms of a
friend, Mrs. Emma A. Borland, who re
sides in a lodging-house at 501 Geary
street. Mrs. Colvin says that her pur
pose in visiting Mrs. Borland was to
escort' Mrs. Borland's mother, a Mrs.
Moore, to Oakland. Mrs. Borland is the
divorced wife of a prominent agent of a
security company in this city.
While Mrs. Colvln was in the rooms of
Mrs. Borland and her mother two men
called Â«t the apartments. Their names
are Ernest Heymans. who calls himself
"Dr/Heymans," and D. Christopher.
â¢ Heymans is an outside solicitor for the
real estate firm of D. Cranston & Sons,
14 Montgomery street, while Christopher
also claims to be a real estate solicitor,
giving his residence as 501 Geary street.
Heymans resides at 2560 Lombard street.
TELLS A STRANGE STORY.
We. the civil sen-ice clerks employed by Aud
itor Baehr, wish to testify to the splendid con
duct of his p.'flce. We see no reason why thn
Auditor should have been cited before the Civil
Service Commission for the reason that certaiu
experts were employed. The public has little
or no idea of the larse amount of extra work
that the State Board -of Equalization forced
upon that office, and we civil service dork*
who have worked on the city's books thoroushly
appreciate the extraordinary amount of work
to be done in the time specified by the law of
the State. Â¦
At the first call for extra clerks made by
Auditor Baehr two other offices also made
requisition for clerks, thus exhausting the extra
clerk list as the records of the office of the
Civil Service Commission will show. Conse
quently the work having to be done within the
time specified, the Auditor was compelled to
hire competent and experienced additional

Rogers denied that his peculiar action
was the - result of Ward's Inquiry. He
says that when Ward spoke to him he
returned to the meeting room of the com
mission and told McCarthy that action
should be" taken Instead of postponing thc
case. Whereupon, Rogers said, the mat
ter was disposed of. Rogers adds that
Baehr did not inform the Commissioners
regarding the appointment of the twenty
clerks.
Yesterday the extra clerks employed in
the Auditor's office gave out the follow
ing statement:
Just after the action was taken Charles
Ward, a politician interested in the fight
of Broderick for the audltorship, inter
posed and asked Commissioner Rogers if
anything had been done in the matter.
Commissioner McCarthy, at Rogers' sug
gestion, then reconsidered his previous
vote and they both voted to disapprove
of the appointments, although a short
time before they had voted to continue
the matter till November 9.
Some time ago Baehr had need of extra
clerks In order to finish up some work.
The demand could not be filled from the
list of eligibles on the civil service list.
So the Auditor secured the services of
twenty competent clerks not on the civil
service list of eligibles. When the com
mission met on Monday night Baehr's at
torney, W. H. Cobb. asked the Commis
sioners to postpone until November 9 its
consideration of the order asking Baehr
why his appointment of the twenty clerks
should not be disapproved, and^the Com
missioners assented.
The political opponents ' of Auditor
Harry Baehr are at the bottom of a petty
scheme by j which "they are endeavoring
to show that Baehr has been guilty of
defying the Civil- Service Commission In
the matter of appointing extra clerks in
his office. The commission at th$ meet
ing Monday night disapproved of Baehrs
action, at the instigation of Charles
Ward, after having postponed the matter
till November 9.
