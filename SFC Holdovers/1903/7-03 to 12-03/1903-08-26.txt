. Professor Mooney says Â¦ that a" public
council of chiefs was held - and he ad
vised against- anything In the nature of
torture, although he learned afterward
that on the last night of the dance the
man referred to had two silts made In his
breast with a knife, each cut being about
half an inch In length.' He declared that
he was not present and did not know of
the occurrence until the next day.
He refutes the charge that he hired or
Instigated an Indian to drag a buffalo skull
by means of cords passed over skew
ers fixed in the man's shoulders. He says
he was not present when the man started,
but that later Mr. ; Seger, the superintend

WASHINGTON, Aug. 25.â Professor
Mooney of the Bureau of Ethnology has
made a statement to Professor Langley,
secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
in reference to the Cheyenne sun dance,
which he is said to have encouraged. He
denies that the dance was paid for by
him in whole or in part, but says that it
was the regular tribal ceremony enacted
by numerous tribes on various reserva
tions every year.'
Within the past ten years, Mooney says,
he has witnessed four of these dances,
which were held with the full knowledge
and sanction of the agent. He denies that
any dancers were strung up with cords
and ' that . of . the' 139 Indians who partici
pated in the dance lately, neld only one
was anxious to undergo the peculiar form
of torture In accordance with a vow "of
sacrifice. ' *â¢-Â»:<: ':5-:*M - Â¦ -
PORTLAND, Me.. Aug. 25.â The war
game began In earnest to-night â¢ Tho
searchlights at 11:55 p. m., when trained
on a warship approaching the harbor en
trance and the batteries at Fort Wil
liams, began a heavy cannonade.
. Two battleships have been theoretically
destroyed by shots from 6 and 13 Inch.
guns at. Fort Williams. Other warship*
can be seen outside the harbor.
â¢ The. vessels fired upon probably were
gunboats or torpedo boat destroyers.
Three small vessels were brought Into
Â¦view by the searchlights at 11:55 and one
round of shots was fired from the 6 and
13 Inch guns at Fort Williams, which, ac
cording to the rules, sank one vessel.
Fort McKinley and Fort Levitt each
fired one round, each of which sank a
vessel, and so in all probability three ves
sels were theoretically destroyed.
At 1:15 a. m.; a large vessel, evidently
a battleship, came into range and was
fired, upon with one round from Forts
Williams and Levitt and three rounds
from Fort McKlnley. The vessel returned
the fire of both the Fort Williams and
Fort Levitt, batteries.. General quarters
were sounded at Fort-Preble. the forti
fications farther inside the harbor, when
the fire was opened from other forts.
The . rattle of musketry was heard In
the direction of Fort Levitt, and It was
supposed an attempt had been made to
land men from the fleet.
At 1:30 a. m. the harbor sear' Fort Pre
ble was filled with launches from the
fleet with landing parties, and the troops
defending Fort Preble. the acknowledged
key to the harbor defense, were firing In
force. The firing at 1:45 was general from
all the forts In the Harbor.

SERKELEY, Aug. 25.â With his
mind already affected by over
work, and filled with fearful
fancies, Wayne McCloud, un-
til last â¢ I .Saturday a copy
editor the" San -t Francisco Exam
iner~and> a/ graduate of the Unrteratty "of'
.California^, became suddenly^insane
shortly after 7 o'clock to-night "and shot
himself to death In the presence of Miss
Margaret L. Matthew, his classmate and
a graduate with him in 1899,' to whom he
was to have been married at that hour.
The tragedy was enacted In front of , the
Marliave house, three" doors removed
from the Matthew home, 2009 Lincoln
street. McCloud and Miss Matthew had
just come from the East Berkeley sta
tion, having arrived on the train due a
few minutes before 7 o'clock. It was
dusk and when they were fairly in the
shadow of some trees In front of the
Marliave house McCloud drew a' pistol
from his hip pocket and pressing it
against his head said: "Well, good bye,
Margy."
Miss Matthew thought he was only jok
ing, but the moment the words were said
he pulled the trigger and a shot rang out.
McCloud fell to the ground with a bullet
hole in the right side of his head, near
the temple.. He said nothing more, and
when the neighbors came to offer assist
ance he was dead. The body was removed
to the Morgue.
BRIDE GROWS ILL.
Miss Matthew was distracted by the
tragic sight and ran to her home to in
form her family, who were all preparing
for the wedding set for that hour. She
told them what had happened and then
became so 111 that physicians had to be
called to attend her. Her condition Is
critical and her mind may be affected by
her trial. * . . :
McCloud and Miss Matthew were to
have been married ; by Miss Matthew's
father, the Rev. .Winfleld S. Matthew. It
was to have been* a very simple affair,
honored by the presence of the members
of the family and a few Intimate friends.
Some of these were going toward the
Matthew home Just as the tragedy was
taking place and saw a part of Its ghastly
features. v
Young McCloud's mental health began
to fall about two months . ago, . when , he
was promoted to the position of ; copy
editor" from a position on the Sunday
staff. His physical health was far from
robust and his mind could not stand the
turmoil and strain of the more important
position. His superiors noticed his condi
tion and gave him a month's leave of ab
sence, during which to recuperate. He
went back to work apparently Improved,
but a week ago the strain began to tell
on him again. He felt himself failing and
so made arrangements togo Into some
other 'work, securing a position with ' a
quicksilver mining company in Santa Cruz
County, which he was to take to-morrow.
His resignation took effect on Saturday,
since when he had been arranging his af
fairs in "anticipation of , his marriage and
the work of his new position. He had in
tended to take his bride with him to Santa
Cruz.;;'^V-
]V*i HIS BRAIN GAVE. WAY.,
Â¦Within the last two days McCloud's
mental derangement became more marked
than before. He acted strangely. Late
yesterday afternoon he called Miss Mat
thew on the telephone and said he wanted
her to come to him.
"I'll come,", she said. "Where are you?"
"I don't know where I am," f be replied.

There is no truth in the report that a

SOFIA. Bulgaria, Aug. 25.â A revolu
tionary band has appeared at the village
of Tcherkoskl, between Adrianople and
Constantinople, within six hours of the
Sultan's capital. The Insurgents and
Turks fought and afterward the Circas
sian inhabitants of the village pillaged
and destroyed three Bulgarian villages in
the neighborhood, killing all the men,
women and children, except a few who
escaped to the mountains.

CONSTANTINOPLE.' Aug. 25.â "Carry
the war to the seacoast," is the latest
battle cry of the Macedonian Insurgents.
This plan is designated to bring the con
flict more directly before the eyes of
Europe and compel the Turkish Govern
ment to weaken its forces in the interior.
Military critics point out that Saraoff,
the Bulgarian leader of the revolutionists,
has been contriving to surprise . the
shrewdest of Turkish commanders In sev
eral parts of the theater of operations.
They also declare that the Macedonians
who are in arms are rapidly acquiring
military habits in thought, action and en
durance, the methods of the brigand hav
ing been put aside in a remarkable man
ner during many of the recent opera
tions.' This change Bhows the Increasing
ability to cope with the Sultan's forces.
Opinion is widespread that while the
uprising will mainly subside at the be
ginning of winter, a situation as bad will
develop again next spring. Hence the
diplomatists continue to dwell upon hypo
thetical solutions, which gives the im
pression that the crisis may take an im
portant diplomatic turn any day.
It Is recognized that Russia still cher
ishes its traditional policy of plucking the
Ottoman apple when it is full ripe, but
it Is continually pointed out that the diffi
culties which confront the Czar elsewhere
are likely to stay his hand until' events

be replaced by a simple propaganda of
national concentration of the Jews in
Russia. It is natural that the Government
cannot in any case tolerate this new de
parture of Zionism. This Is why faith
could not be replaced In Zionism save on
the condition that it return to its old
programme of action. It could in that
case count upon moral and material sup
port for certain of its practical measures,
which would serve to diminish the Jewish
population In Russia. This support might
consist in protecting mandatories of Zion

facilitating the work of emigrant so

evidently outside the resources of the
state, by means of contributions levied on
the Jews. Quite recently the Rus

Professor George H. Rowe, the newly
appointed associate professor of electri
cal I engineering of the college year of
1903-1904, arrived at the university yester
day. He comes directly from the Univer
sity of Colorado at Boulder, where he
holds the position of professor of electri
cal'engineering and dean of the school
of applied sciences.
â¢ Professor Albert William Smith, head
of the mechanical engineering depart
ment, has arrived at the university from
New York. Professor Smith is connected
with the Westinghouse, Church, Kerr &
Company electrical works, and has spent
the summer superintending the engineer
ing work of' their large plant.
Professor Smith Is considered*one of the
foremost men In his line of work in the
country and he gives" up a position with
the Westinghouse Company at a very
large salary In order to continue his work
at the university. Â» .. .>"?;-.-.-./.
The university Inn opened its doors to
day under the new system of manage
ment and" fieventy-flve student appeared
for the first meal, which was served at
noon. The inn will be run under the man-'
agement of the bondsmen of the defunct
inn club, for the benefit of the creo.tors
of the latter organization and for the stu
dents.- The bondsmen are Registrar O.
L. Elliott, Dr. J. C. Branner, vice pres
ident of the university; Professor J. O.
Griffin, Professor R. L. Green and Pro
fessor R. E. Allardice.
It is the intention of the bondsmen to
control the inn until'' the students meet
tHelr obligations Incurred last year and
then to turn It over to the management
of the students. In the latter event the
students In charge will be required to
make a monthly financial report in order
to prevent a recurrence of last year's
failure.
Instruction in the university will begin
on Thursday next and already the stu
dents are busy filling out their study
cards, which this year . will be required
to be filed Friday, a date two weeks
earlier than usual. This innovation has
been thought wise in order to prevent
unnecessary delay on the part of the
students in deciding on the course of
study they will pursue during the sem
ester.
j The freshmen will be allowed to regis
ter to-morrow, and those matriculated
students. who did not. register to-day will
al^o be placed' on the roll. After to-mor
row 'Â¦ students ,who wish to register \ will
be obliged to pay two dollars as a pun
ishment for their delinquency in not-ap
pearing on the regular registration days.
Registrar^. Elliott expects thau a much
larger class of entrants will matriculate
this year than last. Undoubtedly the num
ber of young ladies applying for admis
sion .will, swell the number , of women
students In the university to more than
five hundred, hence It is probable that
some will have to be turned away, as the
limit of women students to be registered
at Stanford has been placed at five hun
dred.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Aug. 25.â
The university Opened officially at 8:30
.o'clock , this morning', when the rolls of
Elliott were thrown open, for
the registration' of students for the- en
suing year. From early morning until
night a. steady stream of matriculated
students poured into the new offices of.
the registrar, which are located in the
building formerly occupied 1 by the geo
logy and mining department, and to-night
approximately seven hundred of the old
students had s!smlfiÂ«d their Intention of
continuing their studies at/Stanford.

Root, Secretary of War-My Dear Mr. Root:
It is hard for me, indeed, to accept your res
ignation and I do so not only with keen per
sonal regret, but with a lively understanding
of the gap your withdrawal tvlll create In pub
lic life. My sense of personal loss is very
great; and yet my sense of the loss to the
nation as a whole it even greater. You have
been over four years Secretary of JWar. I won
der it you yourself realize how much you have
accomplished during that period.- If you will
turn to your first reports and will read therein
the recommendations you made in order that
the army might be put on an effective basis.
you cannot but be pleased at the way In which
there recommendations have now been adopted
by Congress, as well as by the administration,
and have become enacted into law or crystal
lized into custom. We never have had a pub
lic servant of the Government who has worked
harder than you have worked during these four
years and a half and this not merely in point
of time, bat. above all in polrft of intensity,
and your success has been equal to your tabor.
The only reward you have had, or can have, is
the knowledge of successful achievement, of
the performance in fullest fashion of a great
public duty, the doing of which was. of vital
Importance to the nation's welfare. . â¢
Your duties have included more than merely
the administration of the department and the
reorganization of the army on an effective
basis.' You have also been the head of a de
partment which dealt with the vast and deli
cate problems involved 'in our possession of the
Philippine Islands and your success in dealing
with your p*rt of the work has been as signal
as your success In dealing with the purely
military problems. To very few statesmen in
deed, In any country, is It' given at onÂ« and
the same time to achieve signal and striking
triumphs in the administration ond
reform of the military branch of the Govern
ment and in the administration of which was
of what was in effect a department of insular
dependencies, where the problem* were new Â¦ to
our peopfe. and were In themselves of: great
difficulty. Moreover, aside from >cur work in
these two divisions of the Government sen-ice,
I appreciate most keenly the Invaluable advice
and assistance you have rendered me in innu
merable matters of weight not coming directly
In your departmental province, but in which t
sought your aid with thÂ»... certainty of not
being disappointed. Your position on the
Alaskan Boundary Commission at the present
moment is an illustration of these services.
May all pood fortune ' attend you wherever
you. Â«re: the. American people wish you well
and appreciate to the fullest --the debt 'due
you for all that you have done In their be
half. Faithfully yours,- - . .

theory. At the time she disappeared she
was but three years cf age and was play

search was instituted for her, but with

About twenty years after an old pros

To-night the rivtr is falling, although
farms for miles around will be under
water fcr several days. South of here,
at the town of Blue Rapids, the Blue
River rose to within a few inches of the

Thomas Upton.
UPTON HOPES
FOR VICTORY
IN THE THIRD
As the clean-limbed racers got farther
out the weight of the wind steadily in
creased and- the waves began to spill froth
from their green crests. Both boats, with
every stitch of canvas set, smashed Into
the seas, heeling down in the puffs under
the press of thousands of yards of light
canvas until their lee rails were awash
in the foaming brine. Their crews, piled
up weather, were repeatedly deluged with
the showers of epray Eent aloft by their
shark-like bows.
Slowly but surely the thousands aboard
the observation fleet saw that the Reli
ance was gaining, opening a wider stretch
of water between her and the challenger.
The excursion fleet does not go^to this
mark in obedience to the regulations laid
down to govern its movements. As soon
as the Reliance rounded, the patrol flotilla
blew their whistles, and clanging bells In
the engine-rooms sent the whole fleet at
full speed to leeward of the last leg of the
course. There the vast concourse of steam
craft lay wallowing in the trough of the
sea. until the yachts, bowling along at a
FOAM OVER YACHTS.
The spectators watched the jockeying
from the start aith eager interest. It wag
hair-raising to see what close company
the giant single-stickers kept. It seemed
momentarily as if the spars and hulls
would clash, but they wheeled and circled
like gulls, tacking, gybing and putting
about across the line, close-hauled for the
thresh to windward. It was seen that the
.imerican eklpper by his extremely Clever
work had again outgeneraled his rival and
secured the weather gauge. Not only was
the challenger's captain defeated in his
effort to secure the windward berth, but
he actually failed to cross in time to save
a handicapâ an almost unpardonable of
fer.se in a cup contest. Barr never relin
quished his advantage after the srart.
holding the challenger under his lee all
the way to the first mark.
The excursion fleet, like a floating city
built on the floor of th# ocean, lined up
rail to rail In a great semicircle to wit
ness the start. The course, a beat due
south into the wind for ten miles, then a
broad reach or run, as the case might be.
off toward the Cholera banks, thence
hose again to the old red-hulled light
ship, had been set.
An assemblage of excursion vessels al
most as large as that of last Saturday
poured down through the Narrows and
out Into the broad Atlantic to-day to wit
ness the vanishing glory of the challen
ger. The early morning _ had held out
little hope of a race. A smoky haze hung
over the sea, and the wind was very
light from the south. But as the day
wore on the curtain lifted slightly, the
wind blew Etrcng. and clean out of the
south and the dancing swell *parkled un
der the radiance of an August sun. Off
to the west and north the low ramparts
of the Jersey and Long Island shores
could just be discerned through the thin
ning curtain.
BREEZE FOB THE RACE.
The Reliance's victory, narrow as it
was, would have been even smaller had
not Captain Wringe, the skipper of the
British snrp. bungled at the start, send
ing his srraft over the line nineteen sec
onds after the last gun and handicapping
her to that extent. At every point of
sailing the defender's Fuperiorlty was
demonstrated. She gained one minute,
fifty-five seconds In windward work, forty
seconds on the run- to the second mark
and forty-five seconds on the close reach
for home. Based on the magnificent
showing she has made in the two races
already sailed, it is the considerable be
lief of many experts that the cup is safe,
and that it will take son-.ething better
than Fife's latest creation even to
budge it.
NEW YORK, Aug. 25.â In a glorious
wholesale breeze over a triangular
course, ten miles to a leg. the
fieet-footed cup .defender Reliance
again to-day showed her heels to
Elr Thomas Llpton's challenger,
taking the second race of the cup series
of 1903 by the narrow margin of one min
ute and nineteen seconds. It was as pretty
and hard-foupbt contest as has ever been
called off Sandy Hook and had the wind
not fallen during the last ten â¢ minutes,
the record fcr the course, three hours,
twehe rr.ir.utes ar.d fifteen eeconds, made
by the Celurr.bia two years ago, in her
memorable race against the Shamrock II
would have been broken. As it was the
Reliance sailed the thirty miles within
two minutes and thirty-nine seconds of
ths record, which speaks wonderfully of
her speed in the wind that was blowing.

Ssectal Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Aug. 25.â Black skies
streaked with flashes of lightning, a
seething squall tearing boats from
their moorings and sending the fleet
of yachts, both steam and sail, drlv-
ing to leeward, until there was
crashing and splintering of spars and
bulwarks, and in all this Sir Thomas Up
ton in a half swamped launch hastening
to the rescue of imperiled women, was
seen off Sandy Hook late to-day.
In the terrific squall from the northwest
that broke over Sandy Hook at the an
chorage at 5 o'clock the brigantlne rigged
steam yacht Allita. belonging to John H.
Flagler. vice commodore of the Atlantic
Yacht Club, with Mrs. Mandelick, mother
of Mrs. Flagler. and Miss McClenahan
and two maids on board, were driven on
to the big steam yacht Glralda, flagship
of the Philadelphia Yacht Club.
Commodore Abram L. English, Robert
F. Thompson and two others were on the
Glralda. and the Allita. unmanageable, and
with captain and crew In panic, came
broadside on. Bearing true to the whip
ping hurricane, the bowsprit of the Phil
adelphia yacht impaled the Allita at the
bulwarks just aft of the seaboard gang
way. There was a terrific crash as a
huge> hole was torn in the bulwarks and
the bowsprit of the Glralda was broken
short off at the stem. â¢
Then, as the yachts ground against
each other like upper and lower mill
stones, the rigging was torn from Its
fastenings until the Giralda was decapi
tated and the starboard main rigging of
the Allita threatened to go at any mo
ment. There was no opportunity to get
between the yachts and several minutes
before the starboard conjpanionway of
Allita had gone overboard.
"Come here, ladies," shouted the irol-
Iant knight, and Mrs. Mandelick and Miss
McClenahan hastened to the footrall,
where the willing hands of Sir Thomas
and his friends rescued them from the
vicious sea.
Again Sir Thomas' practiced eye noticed
more work to do. Signaling ' his tug
Cruiser to up anchors and steam along
side, another launch, the Smoker, was
quickly filled with a dozen picked sailors,
and with Upton, again went to the en
tangled yachts. Sir Thomas, seeing the
panic of those on board, assumed com
mand of the Allita. After i the Erin's
crew had weighed the Alllta's anchor.
she was towed stern first to a safe an
chorage.

The Reliance whirled about the mark,

romped "away on a close reach toward
Sandy Hook lightship and the finish line.
She was three-quarters of a mile away
before the Shamrock III rounded the
mark.
* Both yachts were heeling about the
twelve-knot wind from south by west and
were sailing at least one mile an hour
faster than the wind was blowing. Their
sheets were eased just enough to put
them on almost their best point of sailing
and one upon which the Reliance has of
ten demonstrated that she is faster than
any racing craft ever built. She was
heeled just enough to bring her
long overhangs to bear and give her the
benefit* of her great sailing length. The
guide vessel, coastwise, was scurrying
along ahead of her at full speed, but the
Reliance was overhauling her Inch by
inch, and when the lightship hove fair
in sight about two miles away, was not
more than a quarter of a mile astern of
the guide vessel. A mile further on the
coastwise sheered off and gave the Re
liance a clear course to the finish.
As the wind softened the Reliance first
set a baby jib topsail which the Sham
rock had been carrying since turning the
second mark and then exchangd it for a
big reaching jib topsail in which the
Shamrock promptly followed suit.
When the Reliance was a quarter of a
mile from the finish line, the wind died
away considerably, but the Shamrock III
came booming along, carrying a splendid
breeze and fast overhauling the leader.
It looked as though the British boat was
going to get within her time limit, but
the finish line was too close, and the Re
liance slipped across It with one minute
and nineteen seconds to spare. The
Shamrock III finished in a softening wind
and both boats were taken in tow to
Sandy Hook. The official time:

CORSAIR IN COLLISION.
J. P. Morgan's Yacht Collides With
Club's Chartered Steamship.
NEW YORK. Auk. 25.â The first serious
accident which has marked the nightly
race home of the steamship fleet from the
racing course took place to-night in the
collision of J. P. Morgan's yacht Corsair
with the fast Sandy Hook steamer Mon
mouth, under charter by the New York
Yacht Club, and filled with members and
their friends. The Corsair struck the
Monmouth a . glancing blow on the star
board side nearly amidships, her bowsprit

stanchions and awning supports- and
smashing woodwork and glass. The Cor

twisted Iron support on her bowsprit, but
not appearing to be disabled.
On the Monmouth there was a brief
panic. The many passengers on that side
of the boat. rushed away to safety. Sev

after 10 a. m., the wind was south-south

Rare Seamanship Displayed by Crews
of Both Yachts.
STORY OF THE RACE.
The wind was so far aft that they
quickly decided that instead of being a
broad reach,- as intended, the course to
the turn -.was a run. Spinnaker booms
were guyed out and the great sails added
to the tall reaches of canvas. Staysails
were taken in and with' spinnaker- booms
guyed well forward the yachts ran away
for turn. ' Both were heading off their
course abit; in order to make their spin
nakers draw well, and they ran that way
for half .an hour, when the Reliance
smothered . her- spinnaker . and began tq
set her staysail. Â¦ During that time she
did not appear to have gained an inch,
but immediately, on laying her true
course she began to draw away.
Ten, minutes . after the Reliance the
Shamrock- III also took in her spinnaker,
set her staysail and headed for the mark.
With the wind : over their quarter both
yachts made. fast. time of it, but it was
apparent that the Â¦ Reliance was gaining.
They, made "the second turn as follows:
Reliance", 1:17:50; Shamrock, 1:21:43.
The " Reliance . was leading by three
minutes fifty-five seconds, -having gained
forty seconds â¢ in', the run across from the
first to the second mark. She had over

difference -at. the start and established a
margin - to , her." credit of thirty-four sec

there was 'faint hope. for the ' challenger.
seconds. Both captains broke out balloon
Jib topsails when they squared fÂ»r the
second turn."
There followed the usual riot of whistles,
mingled with the wail of sirens, the cVang
of. bells and the exultant shouts of pa
triots and the booming- of cannon. The
Shamrock was about a mile astern and
crossed four inutes and forty seconds
later, to a repetition of the not which had
welcomed the Reliance's victory.
Then the great observation fleet headed
bade to New York at top speed,
and it was well that it was so.
Before half . the' fleet had reached
the upoer bay a green gray squall
out of the northwest, raising a curtain of
spray as it came, struck the fleet, bring
ing grief to many excursionists and carry
ing away yacht and steamer awnings and
top hampers generally.
It was a hard day for the overworked
newspaper reporters.' The experience of
two years ago demonstrated the uncer
tainty ofÂ«all wireless telegraphy, but no
one was prepared for the utter collapse of
the system which occurred to-day. - There
Â¦were four competing systems, three of
which were most active. The atmosphere
above the triangular course was beateu
into a hapeless confusion, so that the Mar-
BIOT OF WHISTLES.
The Reliance sailed this leg of ten miles
in fifty-six minutes and twenty seconds.
Then the fleet started for the finish line,
steaming a course parallel with that of
the flying yachts. The last leg was also
covered at roaring speed, the Reliance
still Increasing her lead, with her wake
streaming a-lee, a path of dancing white
on the deep, blue bosom of. the sea. Just
before the finish the wind died down, but
the Reliance went across in ample time to
win. having covered the ten miles in flfty
seven minutes forty seconds.
rrific pace, turned the second mark
The Reliance sought to make her gain
by outpointing the British beat, while the
latter endeavored to make up for what
she lost In pointing by footing faster with
a rap full. At noon the wind had in
creased to ten knots and hauled about a
point Â¦ to^ westward, so _ that both yachts
could lay a straight course to the turn
ing mark not more than two miles > dis
tant. They were heeling hard and drag
ging their lee rails through a lather of
froth and sending it spurting from under
their bows in a fashion that: Indicated
that they ' were I making at least / twelve
knots and that, there, was little danger
that the race would not be finished within
the time limit.' Without making another
tack both- boats made the turn of the
first mark as follows: Reliance, 12:21:30;
Shamrock, 12:24:45. .
' Though the Reliance had a lead of three
minutes and fifteen seconds, she still
lacked six seconds of making, up the time
allowance and the difference of one min
ute and twenty-four seconds at the start.
Officially, the Shamrock III was still six
seconds: ahead of the /Â¦ slippery - Yankee
craft, .but it .was evident that the latter
had won the race, barring accidents. In
a 'breeze varying, from four to ten knots
an - hour : she ' had made good the time al
lowance In a ten-mile thresh to windward
and | there was every reason to .believe
that In reaching and . running, which are
her two* strongest points ', of sailing, she
would quickly overcome that official six
yachts were filled away it was clear that
the Reliance was gaining. Shamrock was
far astern and very little to windward of
the Reliance's course. Meantime the wind
had been Increasing and was now blowing
at the. rate of seven knots. Carrying a
hard full, the Shamrock III was heeling
prettily, mowing through at a fast clip
and making much more fuss under her
bows than the American boat. Captain
Barr was pinching, the Reliance into the
wind until her little baby jib topsail flut
tered.. The race was being fought out on
the same lines as the previous race.
Both went across the line on the star
board tack, ; but held that tack, for not
more than a minute and then headed
for the Jersey coast.' -.Once ; fairly away
Captain Wringe of the Shamrock resumed
,hls tactics of the previous race, gave his
boat a< good rapfull "anu sailed through
the Reliance's lee -and got under her lee
bow, .while Captain. Barr pinched the Re
liance' close into the wind and began to
cover. the distance to the windward mark.
; Captain Wringe's maneuver gave him a
wind clear of interference, and when once
satisfied . that the Reliance could not
blanket his boat, he. flattened in his
sheets and began to point closer to the
wind. Captain Barr,. however, was nurs
ing the Reliance up to windward in mas
terly fashion. . . . ...
Half an hour after the start the Cis
tance between. the. two boats had, widened
materially, the. ;ReIlance, pointing I higher
and the Shamrock Â¦ footing faster. They
.were half a mile apart when they tacked
off Highland Beach at 11:42.. The Reliance
was the first to go about. When ' both
west, half west. The frlnd at that time
was due south and had begun to freshen.
In the preliminary Jockeying Captain
Barr of the Reliance, got the windward
position, blanketing the Shamrock III and
clung to it through various maneuvers
until the 'warning gun had been fired,
when Captain Wringe had got clear of the
Reliance.
At the sound of the gun the Shamrock
III bore off to -leeward and -away from
the Reliance, while Captain Barr tacked
under the stern of the navigator as the
starting gun was fired, and crossed the
line only thirty-six seconds behind the
gun. The Shamrock kept away from tne
lino almost until. the handicap gun fired,
then tacked and crossed It handicapped by
nineteen seconds, for .. which allowance
was, made to her. The nineteen seconds
were dead loss.. The official starting time
was: Reliance 11:00:36; Shamrock 11:02:00.
The actual starting time of the Shamrock
was 11:02:19. ' -/'; Â« â¢
coni system, with all Its careful prepara
tion, wan available for but a single mes
sage throughout the entire day.
It would not have been so exasperating
if the rival companies had been honestly
striving to send their own bulletins, but
much of the interference was obviously
malicious. The wireless telegraph' system,
the fleet of small boats carrying the news
from the course to the shore and a line
of shore observers along the Jersey and
Long Island coast were used to carry
news- of the race, but all three systems
proved a failure.
Before the yachts had reached the first
turn a thick haze overspread the course
and shut them entirely from the view of
the shore observers. Then some indulged
in a guessing match and one of Marconi's
opponent companies professed to have re
ceived a- message giving the hour, minute
and second at which each boat turned the
first mark. .This was well enough until
the official time wat obtained from the
committee boat, and then It was disclosed
that this so-called wireless company was
publishing bulletins from shore observa
tions and wild guesses that had not been
transmitted by wireless telegraphy at all.

so he ran and the officer fired' at him,
but failed to stop him.
Reno officers were called to a ranch
three miles south of town to-night on
a report having been received that a
supposed convict was surrounded.
The officers rushed to the scene, but
discovered that a mistake had been
made. The suspect proved to be the
owner of the place, who had taken to
his cellar from fear of the armed men
he had seen about â¢ the ranch. He
thought they were convicts.

TUCSON, Ariz., Aug. 25.â Five prisoners
confined in the second story of the county
Jail at Tucson made their escape Mon
day morning between 2 and 3 o'clock by
digging a hole through a fourteen-inch
brick wall Just under the eaves and
climbing down a ladder made of blankets
to tho street, forty feet below. H. Or
(juldes, the Mexican Jailer, was asleep at
the time of the escape, wbich-^had been
! curcfully planned. The prisoners had
made knives out of an old lard pail and
used them to dig out the mortar and pry
out the bricks. All of the brick were
lifted out on the inside and placed in a
i blanket without making the least noise.
! Tho side of the county jail from which
tha men escaped faced the city jail, where
the night Jailer was on watch, but the
prisoners succeeded in working without
nttracting his attention. The jailer now
remembers- having heard his dogs bark
at the time the escape is reported to have
been made. The break was not discov
ered until 5 o'clock In the morning, when
a passer by noticed a hole in the wall
and inquired ; the meaning of it. The
county Sheriff believed that the prisoners
were in their cells, but on investigation
it was found that they had flown. Al
though officers are in pursuit, it is be
lieved that the men will succeed In cross
ing the Mexican line.
The escapes are Charles McCormlck, a
boy of 15, who murdered Tony Soto at
Tucson a year ago, and was serving a
five-year sentence, a Mexican Government
prisoner, two smugglers and a negro

Strange to say, Billy Stiles, the famous
border bad man, was brought to Tucson
to-day from Tombstone for safekeeping.
At <â¢ o'clock to-night four United States

with Stiles and his .pal. Alvord, both in
chains. Two officers walked at their side
and another behind with hia finger Â¦ con

considered improbable until the break

Stiles and Alvord protested against be
ing removed and I threatened to create
trouble, but they found their guard so
strong and vigilant that an attempt to
escape would have been folly. They were
warned that if they tried to get away
they would be shot. The officers meant
to take no chances and would have car
ried out their threat. A great crowd had
assembled at the station to catch a
glimpse of the celebrated outlaws.
Since then I have seen similar Insects in
widely separated localities. Jn almost every old
creek bottom -wherever drainage exists from
adjoining oil properties and accumulations of
waste oil stand and become stagnant. In some
of these abodes stagnant water underlies the
oil, mud and moist earth; In others there was
not a vestige of water: In size these Insects
are about one-quarter of an Inch In length and
three-sixty-fourths of the same In width. In
shape they are not unlike a diminutive tent
caterpillar without the obtuseness of bead and
tail, tapering rather to a point at the extremi
ties and In action moving the body much as
the tent eaterptllar does, at no time- raising
the bod? from the surface, and when In the

JUST GATHERED. V _
Free Call Art Svpplement Next Sunday.
C. P. Ream has won a reputation surpassing that of any other artist
in this country as a painter of fruit. "Just Gathered" is characteristic of
his best style, which does not depend upon imitative ability alone for its
excellence, but combines qualities of effect, composition and color har-
mony, which give his works a pictorial interest not usually found in still-
life paintings. â¢
In this picture the plums lie in the grass as if they had been freshly
plucked from the tree, with the bloom still on them, while a ray of sun-
light felling on some of them and on a portion of the grass gives effect Â¦
and variety of color to the composition. There is something infinitely
more pleasing in this suggestion of a natural environment than to the
conventional arrangement of a still life with' a meaningless background,
which is so common in most representations of fruit and flowers.
"Just Gathered" was formerly, owned by Catherine Iff. White of Il-
linois, who bequeathed it to the Chicago Art Institute, in whose perma-
Jnent collection it now is. It was selected by a committee appointed by the
art institute, along with a picture by William Hart, from a number of-
s fered in the.bequest. â¢

that he was in Portland. He immediately
telegraphed there, but a response came
back that Jones could not be found there.
His wife, who is prostrated by
the strange absence of her husband, still
has faith In him and hopes that he will
soon return. Friends, however, have re
luctantly accepted the theory that Jones
has gone for good and has by this, time
placed himself far beyond the jurisdiction
of the State courts. .
ASKED FOR ACCOUNTING.
What he did with the money he embez
zled from the Mooney estate none of his
friends are able to suggest. While they
admit that he gambled away much money
in the nlckel-in-the-slbt machines and
frequently played the races, they are posi
tive that hÂ« never lost anywhere near
the amount hfi has failed to account for.
Possibly, they think, he may have be
come Involved in some mining scheme and
used the money of the Mooney estate,
hoping to make it up in some way and
restore it to the administratrix.
Several weeks ago. when, as stated In
yesterday's Call, "the attorneys for Con
Aiooney, brother of the deceased, who
was endeavoring to break tl.e will of his
relative, effected a compromise, Jones
was appealed to by Con Mooney's attor
ney to have the final account of the ad
ministratrix filed In court. Jones agreed
to do so, but it was necessary for the
lawyer to go to him several times before
the paper was filed. Then, when the case
was called, Jones appeared in court and
asked permission to withdraw the ac
count on the ground that he had made a
mistake. The court granted the. request.
About this time the conten-ing parties In
the contest fell out again and the com
promise fell through.
MOONEYES QUEER WILL.
Later, however, they again got together
and agreed . on a settlement and Jones
was again' Importuned to render an ac
count; which was then long overdue. In
stead of doing so he suddenly disappeared
and, finally suspecting that, something
was wrong, the attorney for Con v Mooney
notified the court of â¢ his suspicions and
the investigation was begun, with the re
sults v as published in The Call.
The Mooney will case has been an inter

who drew up the document, was to find
this "wonian and to satisfy himself as to
her. identity and thereupon pay: over to
her the money iri bank. In. the event. of
falling in this trust, the lawyer was cm
powered to distribute the. money among

AUBURN. Aug. 25.â The Auburn Hotel
waa totally destroyed by fire at an early
hour this morning and two of the guests
perished in the flames. Daniel Christy
who had been a resident of Auburn for
many years, occupied a room on the
ground floor, but was unable to escape
from the building. From the position of
his bodv when fcund It is believed he
was either suffocated or struck by a fall
ing wall Just as he was passing through
the door of his room.
Albert Maither, aged about 22 years, oc
cupied a rear room and as the fire started
in- the rear portion of the house it is
presumed he tried to make his escape
through' the front hallway and was suffo
cated by the smoke. Young Maither was
a native son, residing at the Butcher
ranch, and had been on a visit with his
sister-in-law, Mrs. Archie Maither, a
daughter of Robert Waugh. proprietor of
the hotel. Archie Maither. a brother of
the deceased, was killed bjr an explosion
of dvnamite a little more than a year
ago.
The Auburn Hotel was one of the city's
oldest landmarks and as it was on the
railroad right of way it is not likely that
it will be rebuilt. Thc Freeman Hotel,
one of the largest uostelries north of
Sacramento, adjoined -the Auburn Hotel
and was saved by the ethcient work of
the local fire department.
The estimated loss on the burned build

Forbes avenue will be thrown
A warrant probably will be Issued , in a
few days for the arrest of Hu Jones, the j
attorney whose sudden disappearance 1
from the city has been followed by the j
discovery that he had misappropriated the
funds of the estate of, the late Michael
Mooney.
There is no longer any doubt that Jones
confiscated the moneys In bank tÂ« the
credit of the estate, amounting to over
$13,000. Those who were at first disposed
to regard the ease in a charitable light
and hoped for the return of the' attorney j
have abandoned all , Idea of a possible I
mistake and now confess that things look j
bad for the missing man. In fact, they 1
believe that he will never dare to return j
to the city, where, for years, he was
looked upon as a most trustworthy law
yer.
The evidence of his guilt has grown so
strong that the only step left for the
court is to issue instructions for his ar- j
rest and it is probable that the District
Attorney will be given charge of the case, j
Although the attorneys interested in the
affairs of the Mooney estate keenly ap
preciate the position of their clients in
the absence of the funds left by Michael
Mooney, they have by no means aban
doned hope of recovering the coin, for it ;
developed yesterday that the turning over-r
of the money by the three banks, with j
which it was deposited, to Jones, was an
irregular proceeding. .
WILL SUE THE BANKS.
In fact, preparations have already been
made to bring suits against the Illbernia
Savings and Loan Society, the Columbian
Banking Company and the San Francisco ;
Savings Union, with a view of compelling
them to reimburse the estate. According I
to the claims of the attorneys, Mrs. Me- 1
Namara, the former administratrix of the j
Mconey estate, was not lawfully entitled j
to draw the money out of the banks for !
the reason that she had failed to qualify j
in the position to which she had been ap- j
pointed by the court.
When she was appointed administra
trix, after the death of Mrs. Bedelia
Boyd, the executrix of the Mooney will,
Judge CofTey fixed hor bond at $30,000.
Instead of immediately qualifying, Mrs. j
McNatnara, through her attorney, Hu
Jones, riled a petition for a reduction of |
the bond to $4000, and it was this docu
ment that Judge Sloss, sitting In Judge
CofTey's court, signed.
Pursuant to the law the court ordered j
that all moneys belonging to the estate !
should be immediately deposited In. the ;
California Safe Deposit Bank. It appears
that in issuing the order for the reduc
tion of the bond Judge Sloss erred, in
! that he should have first informed him
'Â¦Â¦ self as to whether Mrs. McNamara had
I already qualified under the original bond.
! ' INVALID â¢ PROCEEDINGS.
i She having failed to do so invalidated
I the order reducing the bond, for in the
! absence of her original bond she was, in
i fact, not a duly qualified administratrix,
and therefore not entitled to recognition
in any subsequent petition by trie court.
Upon "this ground is based the claim of
the attorneys representing the different
heirsâ that Mrs. McNamara was at no
time empowered to give her attorney or
any agency authorization to draw from
the banks the funds of the estate, and
' that in accepting her order the banks did
: so on their own responsibility and arc
I consequently liable for the money they
j gave to Â»Jones.
Judge Sloss' friends, by the way, are
very Indignant over what they claim is
an attempt to shoulder upon him the. en
1 tire blame for the proceeding, for they
assert that he simply followed the word
ing of an order. previously issued by Judge'
: CofTey in the same case, when the last
â¢ named reduced the bond of the executrix,
! Mrs. Bedelia Boyd, from $30,000 to $4000.
j Yesterday Judge Coffey was inclined to
: mildly criticize the action of Judge Sloss,
i until one of the attorneys at the bar re
i minded him of his own order In the same
case. ...
JONES' LAST ' MOVE.
When Mooney died his money was dis
tributed in the three banks in sums as
follows: San Francisco Savings Union,
$9494 71: Hibernia Savings and Loan So
'cicty, $3158 15, and Columbian Banking Com
!Â»pany, $1492 40., On February 1 all these
amounts, with the exception of about $900
In the San Francisco Savings Union, had
been (unlawfully withdrawn by Jonea on
orders from Mrs. McNamara. Not con
tented with these peculations, it Is now
charged that -Jones set about getting the
balance of the money out of the last
nairfed bank, and was finally successful,
but only after a resort to crooked meth
ods.
While going over the accounts rendered
by the bank yesterday Mrs. McNamara
Â¦was shown one item of $645 drawn on her
order by Jones on February 7 last. This
1 she repudiated, and charged that Jones
had raised the amount from $45 to $645.
She claims that she gave him an order to
pay a claim of $45 against the estate held
by James Crowley and representing the
hiring of horses. Â¦â¢ Apparently Jones took
the order and Inserted the words "six
hundred and" and added a "6" to the
'numerals in the corner/of the order. Each
of the banks will be sued for the full
amounts originally deposited with them
to the credit of Michael Mooney.
INVOLVES HIS FRIEND.
The fact that Mrs. McNamara did file a
bond in the sum of $4000 has suggested' the
possibility o* her bondsmen being sued
for that amount of money, but the devel
opment of the fact that the entire pro
ceeding was irregular relieves her sureties
of all responsibility. . When the order re
ducing the original bond was issued by
Judge Sloss Attorney Jones Immediately
hied himself to the office of . his former,
law partner, Joseph O'Donnell, and in
duced Him to join as a surety, a practice
which lawyers often Indulge In and Â¦ one"
which O'Donnell did not s feel inclined to
refuse in a case wherein his old friend
was concerned. As may be easily imag
ined, Lawyer O'Donnell was greatly re
lieved when he learned yesterday that he
could not be held liable for the dishonest
acts of his former partner by reason of
the fact that the whole proceeding was
invalid.
Joseph Haber Jr., who has been ap
pointed to succeed Mrs: McNamara as
the administrator of the Mooney estate,
appeared before Judge CofTey yesterday
and formally qualified, after which Judge
Coffey Instructed him to be in court ; this
morning-, when the investigation Into the
Missing Lawyer's Whereabouts Is
Still a Mystery to Hi^ Anxious

Friends.

DURING the recent convention of the Inter
national Typographical Union in Washing
ton City several of Mr. William Randolph
Hearst's employes appeared and steered an anti
trust meeting in one of the theaters. The affair, had
a distinct campaign air. There were red lights,
transparencies, brass bands and Henry George Jr.
The occasion was not tumultuous, but it is the silly
season and Washington is dull and even a poSr brass
band is attractive. The purpose of it all was soon
disclosed in the booming of William Randolph
Hearst for the Presidency as a trust buster. In the
speeches and resolutions President Roosevelt was at
tacked, defamed and belied in the most approved
and yellow way.
The next morning the New York Sun (trust
organ) appeared with a leading editorial explaining
that the Democrats have a chance to succeed next
year because Roosevelt's enforcement of the anti
trust laws has won him the enmity and opposition
of combined capital. This editorial closed with this
sentence: "All the world knows that the great
prosperity continued in the United States till Presi
dent Roosevelt began, a year ago, his New" England
speech-making against capital organized by its own
ers to promote American industries."
There you have it,' men and countrymen. The
trusts want hard times that they may lay the re
sponsibility at the President's door because he en
forced the law, and the boomers of William Randolph
Hearst want hard 'times that they may lay the re
sponsibility uponthe President because he did not
enforce the law! As worthy alliance of unworthies
as ever tried to fool the people. .
ROOSEVELT AND THE TRUSTS.
California, by authority of Washington officials,
will soon be the seed ground for all the United
States, the great depot from which all that is best
in American agriculture will issue. This is a triumph
in material progress and prosperity of which we are
justly proud, for we have rightly earned it.
DESPITE the attacks made upon him by a dis
contented class of negroes, Booker Washing
ton continues to hold the first place among
those to whom the more thrifty and wiser negroes
turn for advice and counsel. At the recent convention
of "The National Negro Business Men's League" at
Nashville he was the principal speaker and was re
ceived with an earnestness which must have more
than compensated him for the harsh treatment he
received from some of his race on his recent visit
to Boston.
It is worth noting as an evidence of the better sen
timent with respect to the negro which prevails in
the South that the convention was held at the State
Capitol upon an invitation given by the Legislature.
As the Legislature is composed almost wholly, of
whites, the giving of the invitation is a proof that the
rabid hostility expressed by Senator Tillman and a
few other politicians does not truly represent South
ern sentiment, at least so far as the negro worker and
business men are concerned.
Washington of course repeated his well-known
counsel of work ajjd patience as the only means of
solving the problem of the negro in the United
States. In the course of his address he said: "We
shall succeed in winning our way into the confidence
and esteem of the American people just in propor
tion as we show ourselves valuable to the community
in which we live, in all the common industries, in
commerce, in the welfare of the State and in the
manifestation of the highest character. The commu
ity does not fear as a rule the vote of the man, no
matter what his color, who is a large taxpayer. It
is not the negro who owns a successful business or
works at a trade who is charged with crime. While
we are in many cases surrounded with disadvantages,
when we compare our condition and opportunities
with those of the Jews in many parts of Europe, it
is easy to see that almost every opportunity denied
the Jews is open to us. The greater the difficulties to
be overcome, the more strength we shall gain by
succeeding. Every house owned, every farm well cul
tivated and every bai.-k account, every store, every
tax receipt we possess, is one influence which will
operate tremendously in our favor."
The statement that the negro in the South, despite
all. the disadvantages under which he labors, is better
off than the peasants and Jews in many countries of
Europe is fully justified by the facts. There are no
limitations put upon the negro in the South as a
worker and as a property-owner, and as land is cheap
and opportunities for work abundant, even though
wages are small, the more thrifty among the negroes
are prospering. Starting without an acre of land,

A CORRESPONDENT of the New York Her
ald from the City of Mexico has furnished
that paper with an interesting explanation of
ihc political conditions which have led up to the re
nomination of Diaz and assured him another term
as President of the republic notwithstanding a sin
cere desire on his part to leave office and enjoy the
rest to which his long service entitles him. It ap
pears there is a factional struggle developing in the
republic, and were Diaz to retire now it would break
out at once.. . .
For some time past Diaz has been desirous of lay
ing dewn the burdens of government, and as a prepa
ration to that end had settled the succession for two
terms, arranging that Jose Ives Limantour should
succeed him and that Bernardo Reyes should follow
Limantour. The two leaders were aware of the
project of Diaz and were in full accord with it, but
'oices more powerful than they, and even more pow
erful than DiÂ«7. himself, broke up the harmony be
tween them and compelled the re-election of Diaz
as the only means of keeping the republic at peace.
The disturbing forces have their 'seat among the
people themselves. A strong party supports Liman
tour, but is distrustful of Reyes, while a party that
is perhaps stronger still supports Reyes and is
distrittUul of Limantour. The differences of opinion
fundamental. Limantour is regarded as a rep
rts<-ntative of the property-holding class, while Reyes
is a representative of the masses, and while there is
friendship between the two men themselves there is
a rooted antagonism between their followers.
Limantour is of French parentage and was edu
cated in France, and that counts against him with
the Mexican people. He is a man of highly cultivated
mind, a deep student of finance, the possessor of
large wer.Jth and is in close touch with the business
interests of the country. The masses of the people
respect him, but they do not love him, for they do
not regard him as one of themselves. On the other
hand, Reyes is the favorite of the people and the
hero of the army. Mexican by birth and parentage,
he began his career as a boy of 16 by taking part
in the war against French domination. He rose from
the lowest to the highest rank in the army, and then
won laurels as Governor of Nuevo Leon. Thus he
has a good record both in war and in peace, but the
more conservative classes distrust him because they
are afraid of "militarism," of which he is supposed
to be the representative.
Commenting on the rivalry qf the two the Herald
correspondent says: "For many years theV personal
relaticns were entirely cordial and their political re
lations harmonior.s. Both were personal friends of
the "President and. both were heartily loyal to him,
personally and politically. There is no doubt that
botii were fully aware of his plans for the succession,
and there is no doubt that they acquiesced in them
:.nd honestly indorsed them. The rupture which was
precipitated was undoubtedly caused by the over
zealous activity of some of their individual partisans
and followers. As friends acting in concert they could
have carried out the plan of Diaz, continued his policy
and perhaps could have carried Mexico to a point
where her political footing would have been strong
and secure. As rivals for the Presidency their at
titude carries with it a menace even to the peace of
the country. There is no other candidate whose
claims command any serious consideration."
It is noted that in the recent national convention
which nominated Diaz for the seventh/ term one of
the speakers in advocating the re-election of the
President said: "If we are not to enjoy the privi
leges of republican institutions, let us be granted the
opportunities gi\*en by the Americans to the con
quered Filipinos. Let us be governed dictatorially,
but without militarism." The shot was aimed at
Reyes and the hit was recognized. The fact that it
was made is an evidence of the intensity of the feel
ings that have been developed among the partisans.
The outlook for Mexico is therefore by no means
encouraging. It appears that Diaz is the only man
who can hold the various classes of the people in or
der, and he is now an old man and cannot much
longer sustain the weight of government. When he
departs the critical hour will have come for Mexico,
and it behooves her patriots to prepare for it.

than 20,000 persons, nearly all being from
the Eastern States, visited the perma
nent exhibition of the State Board of
Trade in the ferry building during the
Grand Army encampment in this city
and registered their names. A large ad
vantage is expected to be derived â¢from
what the visitors from the East saw and
learned through the agency of the board."
Manager Filcher's report is in part u fol
lows: Â¦-â¢'Â¦* 'Â¦Â¦'Â£Â¦Â¦
A very large proportion of this number were
strangers, and after seeing' the exhibits nearly
all of them were eager for literature descrip
tive of the State or the counties that produceJ
the interesting products. Some few were con
tent with one descriptive pamphlet. while
others deÂ»lred samples of every publication
available. In this way there was handed out
to the visitors during the week from th<s
State Board of Trade's liteTary bureau about
CO.CHX) pieces of literature descriptive of Cali
fornia or some portion thereof. It Is fair to
presume that this literature will nearly all bÂ«
carried back to Eastern homes, where It will
be read and absorbed and passed around and
read again and become a great agency in fur
ther Instructing the Inquiring world regarding
the industrial conditions and opportunities In
this State. It is believed that one of â¢ tha
greatest benefits that will result to California
by reason of the holding of the â¢ encampment
of the Grand Army of the Republic - In thu
city will come to California, through this
aj?rncy. The State Board of Trade's extensive

and which stands as an object lesson of the
rich resources of the State, never demonstra

during the Grand Army Encampment last

THOSE very clever and entertain

renew their acquaintance with the San

The frisky young people with all their
ardor and humor and .good voices are
this time to be heard at the Grand Opera
House, where they 1 will begin a four
weeks' engagement next Sunday night,
appearing in one of the best "of musical
comedies, "The Belle of New York."
Daphne Pollard, the juvenile soubrette
who astonished the city when last here,
still heads the company and the prlma
donnas are little Misses Alice Pollard and
Eva Moore, while one of the great and
essential features of the performances
of the Pallard organization will be found
in the well trained and evenly balanced
juvenile chorus.
. As for the "Belle of New York" per
haps there has never been a musical com
edy that has better held the favor of the
ater goers, but even at that the manage
ment promises that new specialty features
have been added and some new songs will
be sung.
It is also promised that the production
is to be on an elaborate scale, new scen

for the occasion of the reopening at the

Of Cleveland he had less to say, we know not why,
but probably because he felt the lack of a language
equal to his feelings. At any rate he appears at that
point to have retired into the inner recesses of the
Manhattan Club to amuse himself by contemplating
the "moral currents" that are bearing Democracy on
ward to power and the offices.
It may be that the colonel felt the need of a
thirst, but that is doubtful. For many a glorious year
his thirst has been one of the wonders of Kentucky,
and whether clamoring for red liquor or for gore he
has shown an unweariable and unfailing desire for
more. No one ever saw him fullâ nor, indeed, did
any one ever see him empty. Therefore it is strange
he should seek recreation, retirement, rest and
amusement during the dogs days at the Manhattan
Club in New York when every one else is out of
town.
The drinks of the summer in New York have given
the colonel a strange power to see things, and he an
nounces that from his point of view he sees signs of
a Democratic victory in the Presidential contest next
year. Thus he declares himself in an interview: "Mr.
Roosevelt has played a clever hand and will probably
get his nomination to lose the election. All the
moral currents and many physical signs and portents
seem setting against the Republicans, so that if the
Democrats be not wholly bereft both of sense and
fortune they will come back to power in 1904 by an
impulse as mighty as that of 1892 and much more dis
cernib'e, for nobody could force the Homestead
riots, while even now the handwriting on the walls
of Wall street is visible to the naked eye." Â«
Having declared these physical signs and portents
to be visible to the naked eye. Colonel Watterson did
not undertake to describe them, but went on to talk
of possibilities that the Democratic party might after
all be "bereft of both sense and fortune" next year.
The menace comes from the East and from the West.
Cleveland leads one senseless gang and Bryan leads
the other. Watterson preferred to use a â¢different
metaphor and to speak of the leaders of the rival
factions as an upper and a nether millstone, grinding
Democracy to pieces between them. However, he has
hopes of getting' rid of Bryan, for he says: "Mr.
Bryan is killing himself as a public force as fast and
as surely as his enemies could wish. If he goes on as
he seems bent upon going he will become the merest
agitator and claimant, at once impotent and vindic
tive. He will-not carry a corporal's guard with him
into the next convention, and when he bolts â as he
will â there will be few or none to follow him."
A DISPATCH from New,York says: "Colonel
Henry Watterson is spending his summer vaca
tion at the Manhattan Club in this city." Surely
that is a queer place to spend a summer vacation. The
colonel must be in training for Hades. Even New
Yorkers, to the climate born and to the weather bred,
get out of the big city and away from the clubs in the
summer time; and one would suppose that a rural
rooster brought up amid the bucolic delights of
Kentucky, where the dew is on the blue grass and the
bloom is on the rye all the year round, where the
watermelon ripens and the native drinks are full of re
freshment for the body and the soul, wbuhi seek a
vacation among the woodland haunts or the bowered
gardens of. his native State rather than fly to the
torrid metropolis, where the days are sweltering and
the nights are humid," where a man can find nothing
except a thirst.

Neglect of this precaution has led, everywhere, to
an increase in municipal indebtedness and to a rate of
taxation out of proportion to the benefits received by
the taxpayer.
All of this applies equally to San Francisco in the
embarkation upon public ownership provided for in
the charter, but it is likely to receive less considera
tion here than it will get in Oakland, where there is
more concentration of thought upon public matters
and where a calmer consideration may be given to the
grave issues involved in starting out upon a novel
policy. Therefore we are confident that Oakland will
insist upon providing that her proposed water plant
shall carry its first cost, and all of the incidents of ex
pense in its administration, and be run upon business
principles. That city will then have established a new
base line and set a needed example.
Oakland, proposing to start in, with a clear field,
has the opportunity to start right in an experiment,
guided by the extended experience of others and the
ripest conclusions of students of the subject. In
every city owning a water plant the failure to make
that right start has proved to be the weak place in
the policy. It has led to waste, to criminal favoritism,
to every vice possible in public accounting, and
seems, indeed, the parent of all the evils that have
beset the victims of deficient foresight.
T N one form in this city, and in another and more
[ I typical form in Oakland, it is proposed to issue
i â¢*â¢ bonds to a large amount for the purchase or cre
ation of public utilities. In Oakland an issue >s pro
posed to acquire a municipal water supply. As this
was the primary form in which municipalities em
barked in business in competition with individuals, "it
affords means of comparison and a length of expe
rience on which to base conclusions.
The experience of every city in the United States
which owns waterworks marks out plainly one
thing, which wise taxpayers must insist upon as a
condition absolute and imperative. All cities that
have neglected it have had occasion to keenly regret
the oversight, and to accuse themselves of neglect
when it was too late. Every such bond issue for
waterworks as is proposed in Oakland^ should be
voted down and voted down, until it is provided that
the income of the public water plant shall pay 'the
bonds and interest, the cost of maintenance, repair,
enlargement, extension and administration. Unless
this is done a lien upon the general funds of the city
is created and the worst possible results follow. The
policy of public ownership is bound to ferment its
way to a conclusion, and unless this precaution is
taken- at the start cities will find their funds burdened
and their taxing power exhausted in supporting va
rious business plants, so that nothing is left for the
essential objects of government.
Again, it is settled by all students of the subject,
and among them some of the strongest advocates of
public ownership of business plants, that to put the
burden, wholly or in part, no matter how small, upon
the general funds, is unjust to the taxpayer who does
not need the utility â it is, in fact, confiscation of his
property to the extent to which such tax takes it
from him. So it is agreed that each plant in public
ownership should stand on its own bottom. A further
examination of the matter demonstrates that in Amer
ican cities this is the only possible plan by which it
may be hoped to secure a proper business adminis
tration of a public plant. It will be administered then
just as a private corporation would administer it, leav
ing out the item of profit. The water plant requiring
so much each year for sinking fund and interest on
its bond account, so much for maintenance and ex
tension, and so much for salaries and wages and to
offset deterioration, these items fix automatically the
charge to the ratepayers, and so when charged the
general fund is left free for the essential purposes of
government.
without a dollar, without experience in the responsi
bilities of freedom, .the. race as a whole has made a
notable advance in the accumulation of property, and
some of the abler men have become wealthy; Along
those" lines, then, the negro can hope to advance to
?. position of power in the community that will enable
him to command a respect for his rights of all kinds.

THE MAN YOU LOVE. |
IT has been said repeatedly that any woman, who is not positively S
deformed, can, with tact and delicacy, win any man she sets her heart S
upon, buty-can she? How many women have smilingly accepted g
the compliment of the assertion in public, only to ponder the ques- g
tion anxiously, oft times hopelessly, in the privacy of the boudoir. S Â¦
What an old, old. problem it is, to be sure, but oh, how appallingly 8
new to most of the jjentler sex who will read these lines. Matrimony S
âthe right man â a comfortable, happy home. It is the one great orob- g
lem of a woman's life from the cradle to the grave. They are the ideals Â«
that women have always cherished, always will. And how many, or o
rather, how few, realize their ideals. g
It is a problem that few men can understand, or, worst of all. ever g
try to understand. Man. with his lordly assumption of all the preroe- .Â«
atives of life worth havinsr. may woo and win where and when he list- S
eth. But to woman â passive, receptive woman â what is given? She 8
must wait her lover's cominsr. She may not seek, as man does, that which o
pleases her most. And out of the lovers who choose to woo she must o
make what poor selection is afforded her, and, burying the ideal, trive all 5
the fluttering, clinjdng: hope of the future to shaping the real into Â«
something akin" to the srod of her dreams. o
And in this world of sham and s^iow. of the mad chase for wealth. J*
the problem has become vastly more vexatious than it ever was before. Â«
Even though it has been lone accepted as somethine akin to a ioke. it Â§
happens all too often in real life that she loves the poor man. and must Â«
rhoose between him and a wealthier though less undesirable suitor. S
Perverse woman, say the knowing and the worldly; but only the eirl g
who has been confronted with su r h a problem can realize the heartburn- Â§
inp. the sublime emotional tracredy of it all. Whichever way she chooses Â£â¢ Â¦
some great part of the ideal is shattered and â what then? g
Every woman who reads is sÂ«kine the answer to iust such a ques- ' g
tion. Just a few of thnse who w r '"te have tried to answer it for her. g
Such a one is the "Half-Hour-Storiette" in the next Sunday Call, en- Â§
titled "When Jabberwock Rode." Curious title, isn't it? Well, it is a O
curious story, and one that an<we rs the nroblem asâ well, read it and S
see if you would answer it that wav. If you are a woman it is ten g
chances to one you would or â would you? Â§
Perhaps, after all. vou wouldn't, for th<-re is another storv that solve* Â§
the riddle in a'different wav. It is called "Barwixt Dad nnd Toe." but Q
the problem before the eirl is not exactlv what you would infer from p
that titleâ indeed not by a erea* deal. Nor can you euess what man- Â«
ner of finesse she used to br?TTÂ» about a happy eidineâ the oÂ«lv sort an S
. ardent eirl will ever accent. Still another is "Under the Car of the g
Juggernaut." but the eirl in this storv dM not have th-'nes as much her O

came well up to the level of the preced
ing work and closed a bit of symphony
making that we have not seen the like of
since Scheel was here before.
The novelties of the programme were a
swan song of Sibelius, a valse de concert
of Glazounow, and the Mendelssohn
"Spinning Song," arranged for orchestra,
Sibelius came first, the young Finn's
work proving to be an ultra-
Wagnerlan and very charming bit
of orchestral writing, with the
song of the dying swan (on the
oboe) as motif. The croon of the north
is about it! the pure and alien flavor of
an ancient Eaga. Mr. Scheel was not
wholly fortunate in his "swan" soloist;
but the movement left a distinct desire
to hear more of the new composer. Gla
zounow's valse is the sort of decorative,
swinging stuff Scheel used to give us in
his Vienna Prater days, and is very good
of its kind. The Mendelssohn "Fileuse,"
as it was rather absurdly programmed,
came without warrant of its step-frater
nity. However, as the Man Who Knows
says, tho little song without words could
not have been better orchestrated. I
heard afterward that Scheel himself had
added the dash of horn and woodwind
that leavened the strings, and that the
movement was originally arranged for
string quartet. It was delightfully played,
and elicited a double encore.
An Interesting Trip.

oped an orchestral brotherhood, an artis
tic unity, nothing short of astonishing.
And bravo, again, the audience!

phony's the question, and yesterday aft

"Eroica." Scheel's reading of the work
was masterly. Us performance excellent.
Dignity without stodginess, delicacy with
out triviality, plasticity without sloppi
ness, characterized the handling of the
whole composition. It was polished,
suave, finished. Each theme fell upon the
ear with lucent logic, every phrase came
in delicately balanced relation to its
neighbor. Tonal beauty, climax, a sensi
tiveness of light and shade truly remark
able pervaded the whole performance.
Perhaps in the funeral march the fash
ion of Mr. Scheel's grip upon .his men
was most apparent. In the long move
ment there was not once a deflection of
interest, that was breathlessly main
tained until its last somber note. The dif
ficult' tread of the tempo went steadily
to its final dying step, the superb pro
cessional moving with utmost nobility
and grandeur. Each tiny banner of
sound lent its little richness to the cor
tege, no glint or gleam of the Beethoven
color was lost, but the lovely detail was
merged into one splendid whole, one ador
able unity. The strife and turmoil of the
first movement also found significant ex
pression, full value being given to the
dramatic side of this musical drama, with
Its majestic themes and colossal har
monies. The reading was throughout
spirited and ripely picturesque. The
scherzo, taken at a dazzling tempo, fur
nished new delights. It was played with
breathless* delicacy and lightness and the'
orchestra showed nowhere more conclu
sively Its advance under the Scheel re
gime. The performance of the finale also
Opera-house shows not an Inch of empty
upholstery at a symphony concertâ given
in the afternoon, be It remembered; when
the gallery below shows a like conges
tion, the community may begin to take
some comfort as to its musical health. So
It was, handsomely, yesterday afternoon.
Nor les? remarkable and encouraging is
the continued fashionable interest in the
series. The wise Colonel Higginson of
Boston rested not until he had imposed,
the belief upon Madame Hub that with
out the symphony cachet sne was out of
"It." To-day she would as soon dream
of neglecting her symphony subscription
as Madame Gotham would of going with
out her box at the Metropolitan Opera
house. With the result that the Boston
Symphony Orchestra is upon a paying
basis, and. not unimportantly, of the
world's best. Let us pray, therefore, that
madame of the local haut monde will con
tinue to regard attendance at the sym
phony as an imperative social propriety
as well as a high pleasure.
The general plan of the school has been
arranged by George H. Boke, of the head
of the law school, who Is also Instructor
in law at the University of California. An
advisory committee, consisting of William
Carey Jones, head of the law department
of the University of California, and Pro
fessor Nathan Abbott, dean of Stanford
Law School, has given great assistance
in the preparations for this work.
The following men have been engaged
to teach in the school during the ap
proaching year: James A. Ballentine of
Yale and Harvard Law School; James T.
Burcham, instructor of law at Stanford
University; F. S. Dorety, Instructor of law
at the University of California; George L.
Clark, Instructor in law at Stanford Uni
versity, and Irving C. Wright, a graduate
of Harvard Law School.
The night law school of the Young Men's
Christian Association will be reopened on
September 1 and the faculty has been en
larged, as it Is expected that there will be
a big class during the coming term. The
school has been much improved and noth
ing has been left undone to make it thor
ough in every particular.
Large Class Is Expected to Enter and
Many New Teachers Have
Been Engaged.

KANSAS CITY. Mo., Aug. 23.â A. O.
Evans, of Santa Rosa, Cal., was mar
ried to Mrs. M. S. Spear, of Springfield.
Ills., at the Savoy Hotel yesterday. Mr.
Evans and his bride were sweethearts In
their childhood in San Antonio, Texas.
She was an orphan and her guardian was
Wji J. Craig, general freight, passenger
and claim agent of the New York, Texas
and Mexican railway, a Texas branch of
the Southern Pacific.
The suit of young Evans was discour
aged by the guardian, although Miss
Craig loved him. She was induced to
wed another man, however, and became
Mrs. Spear. Her husband lived In Spring
field, 111., but he died about a year ago.
The friends of the youthful lovers ar
ranged a correspondence and Mrs. Spear
visited relatives at San Antonio. The
result was a renewal of the old ties. Last
month, Mrs. Evans, mother of the gToom,
went to nprthern summer resorts with
Mrs Spear. A letter from the latter to
her sweetheart in California,, told v that
they would be in Kansas City yesterday.
Mr. Evans was here to meet them, and
the weddlne followed.
Mr. Evana and his wife will live In the
Republic of Mexico, where he has a po
sition with the Mexican Gulf and Inter-
Oceanic railway. The newly married
couple did not telegraph to any of the
bride's relatives of the marriage.
"We are old enough to know," was the
explanation they gave.

It would have probably been interesting
even at that had not Graham fixed it all
by throwing the away in the sev
enth. .Leahy was on third and Pabst
was on second, when Krug hit the ball
to Graham. He threw to third in order
to catch Leahy off the bag. But the ball
bounded through a hole in the fence op
posite the beacherB and went into the
crowd. All three runners came in on this
and the game was settled for keeps. , The
score: f"
â¢ Oakland jumped into the lead during
the first inning, when the two tallies were
rolled up. After that they kept adding
to the runs until they had accumulated
live. It began to look pretty safe for
the Cripples and they became care
less and this little oversight just about
tossed off the game.
The home team began to get into the
running In the fourth. Every .â¢ man
seemed to have his eyes m the leather
and smote it to all t s e f^ur corners of
the lot. They did not stop until five had
made the circuit, giving San Francisco a
lead of one.
Uncle Henry was lucky in getting away
with the game yesterday- at Recreation
Park. He was beaten to a fare-ye-well
up to the fourth, when a few good and
lucky hits put him one to the good. But
even then he was not safe. Luck stayed
with the team, however, and In the sev
enth round, Graham threw, the ball away
and let in three runners. That broke up
the game and settled the issue. Score,
San Francisco 9; Oakland 6.*
Graham was In good form for a time
and Iberg was himself after the tide
turned in his favor, so the honorB be
tween the twirlers were about even.

SARATOGA, N. Y., Aug. 25.âMcChes
ney's meeting with Hermis and other
Eastern racing cracks was again post
ponded, owing to the muddy condition of
the track after the early morning storm.
For nearly a sixteenth of a mile on each
side of the judges' stand the track was
a veritable lake of water, In some places
being several inches deep. A big force
of men worked all morning with cups,
shovels and buckets bailing the water off
and throwing It Into the~"lnfield, but it
could not be improved sufficiently to per
mit the champions to be seen at their
best, so they were scratched from the
Champlaln Handicap.
Africander, who was eligible at 116
pounds, was added, and with Fuller to
pilot him, easily added about $3000 more
to his already long list this season. Him
self, only 9S pounds on his back, was
runner up and he performed creditably,
beating the pace maker, W. C. Whitney's
three-year-old filly. Girdle, by half a
length In a drive. Old Circus was fourth,
with Hunter Ralne, who did not appear
to relish the going, a bad last, running a
very poor race.

SpecUJ Dispatch -to The Call
CHICAGO, Au$. 25.â Ed Corrigran, mas
ter of Hawthorne, came near being
rnobbrd after trie finish of the third race
at Hawthorne Jo-day, when his old rogue
Hargis, a red-hot favorite, was badly
beaten by Linguist and Louisville. "When
Hargis, with Henry up, returned to the
judges' stand, ;liere was a general hiss
ing and cries of "Robber!" from all quar
ters of the grand -Ftand, and nearly 1000
1-eople crowded about the stand and cried
â¢Â¦Rule him oft:" referring to Henry.
When a man standing r.ear Corrigan
joined in the hissing, Corrigan struck him
a \icious blow on the Jaw, knocking: the
man down. Crlf-s of â¢â¢Shame!" were Inward
on all sides, and Corrigan, fearing more
trouble, hurried away.
Hargis was the favorite in the race at
eix to five, with Linguist well backed as
second choice. The colt took, the lead at
The start and maintained it to the end,
winning from Louisville by a neck. Hargis
was last ail the way to the head of the
stretch, when Henry, after apparently
choking him, as It seemed to some of the
crowd, turned him loose. He gained fast,
but the rtin had been delayed too Ions,
and he was beaton but half a length for
r-ace by Louisville.
This was the feature event on the card
to-day and only four horses started, the
outsider being Rankln. The track was
fast, the weather hot and the attendance
pood. Summary:

from the south yesterday . afternoon. They
reached Oakland In time to witness the game
As soon as Peter beheld them he dug up : a

Johnson Is -a six-footer, built on the plans of

"Wanted to Teach Him Poker.
Discovers That There Is No Truth
in Mrs. Mary Vliet's
Story.
Police i Judge Mogan. after a few min
utes* deliberation yesterday afternoon, al
lowed Frederick Crossman. whom Mrs.
Mary Vllet charged with threatening her
life, to go free. There was no evidence
to show that Crossman had aver threat
ened the life of the woman and the Judge
promptly dismissed the case without ex
amining a single witness.
Mrd. Vllet. who on different occasions
has been known as Mrs. Hayes, Mra.
James and Mrs. Nelson, swore to a war
rant a few days ago charging Crossman
with threatening her life on the afternoon
of August 13.- It later developed that
Crossman never threatened the life of
the woman, but that she stopped him on
ths street and engaged him In conversa
tion, and Is alleged to have asked him to
elope with her. Crossman ignored the
woman and she. in a spirit of revenge,
swore out a warrant for his arrest.
Crossman was out of town when the
warrant was sworn to, but as soon as he
returned he gave himself up and the case
came up yesterday afternoon. When
Judge Mosran learned the facts ho
promptly threw the case out of his court
and told Crossman to go free, as It was
plain that there was no evidence to hold
him.
JUDGE MOGAN ALLOWS
CROSSXAN TO GO FREE
With his left jaw fractured In the sev
enth round by a dazing right uppercut
delivered by Billy Otts, Toby Irwin con
tinued to fight up to the tenth round last
night at the Reliance Club In Oakland.
Referee Eddie Smith then announced that
because of the injury Irwin could not go
on and Otts was awarded the decision.
Handicapped though he was for the
three last rounds, it was generally con
ceded that Toby had a strong lead over
Otts and would eventually have been de
clared the winner had the" bout progressed
the limit of fifteen rounds. In the eighth
round Irwln pummeled the soldier fighter
from the Philippines into a wobbly con
dition and it was only the longed-for
clang of the bell that saved Otts from
having his .colors trailed in defeat.
Both boxers resorted to jabbing' tactics
and before the battle had reached the
fourth round Irwin had brought the blood
from^Otts* nose. He then used his left
continually on the Bore organ, causing
Billy much annoyance. Toby did most of
his execution with his left hand and but
rarely brought his right glove into ac
tion. V His blocking and smothering of
blows aimed at his anatomy was clever,
as was the footwork of Otts.
In the opening round the boxers led,
sidestepped and blocked with honors
even. In the second Toby straight lefted
Billy and collided with a right swing that
caused him to wonJer where he was. At
the bell both,boxers were fighting fiercely.
There was a fast mixup In the third,
out of which Otts came bleeding profuse
ly. Billy assumed a crouch in the fourth
round, but was straightened up by Toby's
left hooks. At the close of this round Ir
win's head was knocked back with a snap
and he clinched to protect himself- from
Otts, who bored* in viciously. There was
considerable fiddling in the fifth, the best
blow being a right cross from Otts that
brought up against Toby's jaw and made
him slacken his pace. Otts tried for the
stomach in the sixth, # but Toby guarded
well and drove his opponent all over the
ring. ,~
The seventh began with a* feint and a
clinch. Otts then stepped in and drove
up a terrific right that stopped flush on
the point of Irwln's jaw. This was the
blow tbflt did the damage, but Toby nev
er heeded the smash and had Billy In dis
tress at the gong. Irwln went right after
his man in the eighth and had Otts tot
tering when the .round closed. Toby con
tinued his aggressive battling in the
â¢ninth and Billy was again caused to wob
ble. AVhen the bell sounded for the tenth
Referee Smith announced Irwin's injury
and proclaimed Otts the victor.
In the preliminaries Young McConnell
knocked out Jimmy Troy in the second
round of a' scheduled four-round go. Dan
ny Sullivan gave, Fred Otts all he cculd
assimilate in three rounds of a limited
eight-round bout, the contest being
stopped by the referee.
These bouts marked the resumption of
boxing in Oakland after a lull of ten
months. The events were witnessed by a
large assemblage.

The San Bernardino County Exchange
represents 660 carloads of citrus fruit
shipped last year, and It expects to con
trol 1500 to 2000 the coming season.. It
plans to market. its fruit independent of
either the exchange or the Citrus Union,
both of which are represented lij the
Eastern -markets by the California Fruit
Agency, a joint selling concern. It is ad
mitted that it will cost the county ex
change more to market the fruit than It
would the Southern Californl. Exchange,
on account of the much greater volume
of its business. But the alleged arbitrary
methods of the latter, In combining with
theÂ«Citrus Union to force independent
growers Into the concern, led to a step
which may be far-reaching and. possibly
lead to the demoralization of the markers.

SAN BERNARDINO, Aug. 25.â The San

of this county, except the extreme west
ern, in session at Colton to-aay, voted to
withdraw from the Southern California
Fruit Exchange. This action wa3 taken
by- the directors after the question had
been referred to the separate exchanges
for ratification, and it means the first
substantial defection from the co-opera
tive plan of marketing fruit which has
been in vogue in Southern California for
a dozen years.

FROM FRUIT EXCHANGE
LONDON, Aug. 23.â Arthur Russell, ex
aminer of the official receiver's office, who
had charge of the liquidation of the Whlt
aker Wright companies, was the principal
witness to-day against Wright. He said
that at the end of November, 1900, the
London and Globe was indebted to brok
ers and Jobbers to the amount of $8,017,280.
This liability, which did not appear on
the balance sheet December 6, 1900, was
transferred to the books of the sister
companies, of which Wright was man
aging director. In December the London
and Globe was dealing in shares of com
panies which had never been formed and
to which no capital had ever been sub
scribed. 8hares to the extent of more than
$5,000,000 in companies of which Wright
was managing director" had no market
value whatever. The case was continued.

BOARD OF EDUCATION
ON ANNUAL INSPECTION
When the houses had been pillaged the
Turkish peasants loaded their horses with
whatever the soldier* left and the resi
dences were burned. The sack of Kreus
hevo lasted three days.
On the following ihorplng the Komstljas
established a provisional Government and
instituted a jnew police and municipality.
They killed ten Christians, whom they be
lieved had betrayed their _plans of the
commission. The notables of the town
were compelled to contribute $10,000 to^the
revolutionary fund.
The provisional Government constructed
a. rampart inclosing the town and the in
habitants were ordered to melt down
their spoons to make bullets.
The Turks, Informed of the capture of
the town, sent from Perlep three squad
rons of cavalry, which were attacked en
route and compelled to retire with a loss
of 100 killed.
On August 13 the Turks concentrated
seven battalions and one battery on
Kreushevo.. They made an offer to the
Komltaijltas to allow the women and chil
dren ' to leave town. This proposal waa
declined and the bombardment began. The
.Komltaijltas quickly abandoned the town
and escaped to the neighboring forest,
where pursuit was Impossible.
The Turks entered the town, and. guided
by Turkish . villagers from the neighbor
hood, attacked the .houses of the' Greek
notables and ordered the inmates to | bÂ«
searched and stripped. âThey seised the
money and Jewels and ravished the wo
men, those who resisted being killed. A
Greek priest who sought to protect his
daughter was killed. The girl's earrings
were torn out andyher hand was chopped
off to secure a bracelet. I
.The terrified inhabitants remained in
doors. The band first burned the resi
dences of the Mudlr and massacred the
garrison of Turkish soldiers and officials
of the town, but the intruders spared the
Turkish harems.
After making fortunes abroad by their
diligence and economy they return to
spend their wealth in Kreushevo, where
they own fine houses, furniture and Jew
els. The Turkish inhabitants of the sur
rounding villages have long envied the
prosperity of Kreushevo. In July last
the authorities of Kreushevo, observing
the threatening movement, begged the
Vail of Monastir to send reinforcements,
as the garrison of thirty soldiers was
Insufficient to cope with an insurgent at
tack. These warnings were ignored. On
August 2. the day fixed for the Bulgarian
attack on Kreushevo. while four mar
riages were being celebrated In the Greek
church, a number of Komstljas, by pre
arrangement, remained hidden in . the
church and were locked In by the sacris
tan on' the conclusion of the ceremony. Â¦
At 10 o'clock at night they sounded an
alarm by ringing the church bells. Simul
taneously a band of 30Q Insurgents headed
by Peteroff entered the town, discharging
their rifles. .

gaily Collected Taxes.
In response to an inquiry from District
Attorney Adair of Mariposa County rel
ative to the repayment of Illegally col
lected tax moneys. Attorney General
Webb rendered an opinion yesterday set
ting forth the status of all such claims J
Section SfcG4 of the Political Code made it'
mandatory upon all Boards of Supervisors
to refund the amount of taxes illegally
collected. An amendment was passed at
the 1901 session of the Legislature making
it necessary for payees to present their
claims within a period of six months af
tt-r fcuch illegal payment.
The Attorney General holds In respect
to~c!aims more than two years old that
section 4072 of the Political Code is applic
able. This measure provides that claims
must be filed within a year after the pay

The funeral will take place as stated unless

BY A POLICEMAN
Â» .
Detectives Wren and Bailey were sent
to investigate the case, but they have lit
tle hopes of making an arrest.
The victims describe the robbers as
young men, each about 25 years of age.
Neither patrolman had seen any one in
the neighborhood whom they could sus
pect, and they were surprised when told
of the affair. . . Â¦â¢
"Now, gentlemen, if. any of you make a
move it's all day with you. We need
this money; otherwise we would be more
lenient with you," said the desperado
calmly.
Both men backed out of the .door and
when Dr.- Kimmiss ; recovered Ihimself
and ran to the street they had dis
appeared. Police whistles were blown
and Policemen P. J. McMannus and Tom
O'Connell were soon on the scene.
Chief Deputy Tax Collector J. A. Simp
son was next commanded to hand out his
valuables. When he told the - desperado
that all he had was the 25 cents on the
tablo in front of himÂ«he was ordered to
turn out his pockets.
About this time the other robber called
upon- his partner to hurry up and get out
of the place.
f With his pistol still pointed at the pro
prietors he backed away a,nd leaving his
partner to hold Bohner under cover with
his sun he went into the back room of
the place. Five men were seated at a
table playing a friendly game for the
drinks. The robber leveled his revolver at
the players and said that he was In need
of money r.nd that if any of the partici
pants in the game made a move he would
kill them. Bruce D. Kimmiss. a physician
living at 201 Turk street, one of the play
ers, thinking that the robber was joking,
Bald, "I have $25 and a good watch and
chain. If you get It you are a good one."
The robber in stern tones replied: "Now,
I'm" not kidding: cough up or I'll certain
ly nut you to sleep for keeps."
Kimmiss realized that the man meant
business and handed over "his wealth and
his Jewelry. C. H. Lauders, who is as
sociated with Kimmiss, was the next vic
tim. On the thug's demand he handed
over his watch and chain and 25 cents.
Charles Rust, a Grand Army of the Re
public veteran, handed out a nickel and
was lucky enough to hold out a valuable
gold watch and chain.
SIMPSON PARLEYS.
VICTIMS OBEY ORDER.
Just at midnight two men walked into
the grocery store, entered the saloon por
tion of the place and covering the pro
prietor, John Bohner, with revolvers,
commanded him to throw up hia hands,
with the threat that If he refused he
would be filled full of lead.
Â¦ Both men had their faces covered' with
bandana handkerchiefs, with only their
eyes showing.
When Bohner was co'vered by the men
he thought that they were some boys
of the neighborhood who were joking
with him, but the imperative demand of
one of the robbers to throw up his hands
had tho desired effect. Bohner had a pis
tol at the end of the bar, but with both
men pointing their revolvers in his face
he had no chance to reuch for it.
One of the thugs walked behind the bar
and took 1-5 from the register.

ADJUTANT GENERAL.
At the present time he holds the re
sponsible position of Adjutant General of
California, having been appointed by for
mer Governor Gase to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of General W. H.
Seamans. General Stone is a man of abil
ity and executive force, but it is a ques
tion whether he could adjust his busi
ness affairs so that he could give all of
his time to the public service for a period
of two years. It is understood that he
asked to be relieved from the^dutles of
the Adjutant Generalship shoFtly after
Governor Pardee was inaugurated, as he
desired to give, more time to the cement
manufacturing business in which be is
largely engaged.
Henry J Crocker may become a for
midable competitor for the Republican
nomination for Mayor. Efforts were made
by his friends two years ago to get him
into the political arena, but he positively
refused to go In.
It la the Judgment of many Republicans
that Charles \V. Slack would make an ex
cellent Mayor, but his consent to run for
office cannot be obtained. It is the general
talk that his nomination would be equiva
lent to his election.
A. B. Spreckels, another widely known
popular N Republlcan, has been urged time
and again to allow his name to be pre
sented a* a candidate for Mayor. He gives
a negative answer to every delegation.
His duties as president of the Board of
Park Commissioners are congenial and
take about all the time he can give to
the public service.
Reuben H. Lloyd has been declining
nominations for Mayor ever since 1876,
and the habit of declining has so grown on
him that he cannot break away from it.
FIELD OF ASPIRANTS.
There is a large field of Republican as
pirants for the Clerkship. Talk
of a complete readjustment of that de
partment of the municipal government
meets with great favor. Among the prom
inent names mentioned for the nomina
tion are those of Colonel Thomas O'Nell.
Major Hugh T. Sime and State Senator
John H. Nelson.
There ia very little opposition in Demo
cratic circles to the nomination of Frank
lin K. Lane for Mayor. Yesterday a well
known Democrat remarked:
"The programme is to nominate Lane.
A printing office downtown is getting cut
his picture, fifty feet wide and one hun
dred feet high."
Thomas W. Hlckey la the organization's
candidate for chairman of the Democratic
convention. Joseph E. O'Donnell^wlll be
put forward as an opposing candidate.
Unless all signs fall there will be lively
doings in the Democratic convention.
District Attorney Bylngton's renomlnatlon
is assured. The masterly activity of his
deputies at the primary election brought
teveral solid delegations to the Byington
camp. The old Democratic plan of ap
pointing a special committee to select can
didates for the Board of Supervisors will
not be set aside to please the district lead
ers. Franklin K. Lane may be permitted
to name the whole bunch, after the fash-
Ion introduced by James D. Phelan.
The advisory council, or central body, of
the United Republican League will meet
this evening to consider campaign sub
jects. This central body; la composed of
the vice president and executive commit
teeman of each Assembly district club of
the league. Topics pertaining to registra
tion will receive special attention to-night.
The league Is desirous of getting every
Republican voter on the register.
Citizens of San Francisco should not
overlook the fact that two Important elec
tions will take place before the regular
municipal election. On September 23
twelve propositions for public Improve
ments will be submitted to the people.
The question will then be settled whether
bonds shall be issued to carry out these
proposed measures of improvement. On
October 8 the Geary-street railroad prop
osition will be submitted to the voters.
On Tuesday, November 3, the election of
municipal officers for the ensuing two
years will take place.
The Republicans stand an excellent
chance of .winning nearly everything in
sight at the election for local officers.
This bright prospect of success is bring
ing out a lesion of candidates for the
favor of the nominating convention. In
the matter of Supervisors a great deal
of interest is manifested. Voters were
assured when they were invited to sup
port the delegates put forward by the
clubs of the United Republican League
thaf the Assembly district delegations
should settle the question of Superviso
rial nominations. It happens that the
number of Supervisors corresponds with
the number of Assembly districts, hence
it is probable that each district delega
tion will present to the convention the
name of an indorsed candidate for the
Board of Supervisors.
It would.not cause a great deal of sur
prise in political circles if General George
Stone should become the Republican nom
inee for Mayor of Ban Francisco. His
merits as a possible candidate were con
sidered two years ago, but at that time
he would not permit his name to go be
fore the convention. His friends assert
that he would accept the nomination in
this campaign If the convention should
decide to place him at the head of the
ticket.
He asked if the merchants were pre
pared, to go on another series of years
with schoolhouses a discredit to any first
class city, with sewers a patchwork, end
to end, and a public library in unfit quar
ters, am* with parka and playgrounds ab
solutely below the standard of any first
class city.
F. W. Dohrmann felt the bond issue re
quired careful and serious consideration
before reaching a final conclusion.
Ex-Mayor James D. Phelan approved a
bond issue so far as it applied to new
schools, a new City and County Hospital,
parks and playgrounds and a scientific
sewer system. He deplored the condition
of the City and County Hospital, which
he described as a germ breeder and death
trap.
Other speakers were Miss Catherine Hit
tell, City Engineer Grunsky and George
Renner.
Symmes spoke of the opportunity the
citizens will have to vote on the proposed
Issue of bonds to the amount of I18.0UO.00O
for city improvements. Judging from
what many people were saying, said
Symmes, there seemed to be a lack of
confidence in those who were liable to
have the spending of the money, an as
sertion that prompted a volley of ap
plause, repeated again and again.
Whether the lack of confidence was Jus
tified or not, said Symmes. it must not be
forgotten that extravagance exists and
will continue to exist in all municipal aÂ£
fairs, which he said could not be conduct
ed exactly like a mercantile business.
Though unable to attend. A. S. Baldwin
wrote, stating that he opposed the Issu
ance of bonds for the construction of
school buildings, sewers or any other Im
provement or purchase of land, because
he thought that sufficient revenue could
be obtained after payment of salaries and
the other expenses connected with the city
government to provide for auch improve
ments and acquisition of properties, pro
vided the retail liquor license should be
increased to a sum corresponding with
licenses In vogue In other cities of the
country. Baldwin went on to say that
during the last five years the assessment
of real and personal property had been
Increased about J20.OCO.000 and the tax
eaters, he continued, had kept a steady
eye upon the increase and had added a
sufficient amount to the salary roll and to
the list of employes to consume it all.
Thexe was a largely attended meeting
last night at Golden Gate Hall, called by
the Merchants' Association with the ob
ject of considering the proposed bond is
sue which is to be voted on next month
by the citizens. Frank J. Symmes. presi
dent of the Merchants' Association, pre

According to the story told by the rela
tives of the deceased to Deputy Coroner
Michael Brown last evening. Bowers was
taken 111 eleven weeks ago after partaking
of some ham. During his illness he was
treated by three physicians, who diag
nosed his case as ptomaine poisoning.
The statement of decedent's brother and
his wife ia to the effect that the wife of
Bowers." who resided at 370 Clementina
street, purchased the ham after partak
ing of which Bowers was taken 111. Upon
her return, home the deceased, they as
sert, partook of the ham and in about
twenty minutes was taken violently 111.
Dr. Dillon was called and attended to
him for two weeks at his home.
He was then removed to the Waldeck
Sanitarium, where he was under the care
of Dr. McLaughlin for four weeks, and
returned to his home in an improved con
dition. Pr. JUagan was then called in,
but, according to the statement of Harry
Bowers, refused to act as medical- ad
viser, owing to the fact that. Mrs. Bowers
failed to give Bowers tne. medicine pre
scribed. He rapidly grew worse and yes
terday afternoon, Alta Lodge No. 105, I.
O. O. F., had him conveyed to the Qer
man Hospital, where he died at 4:30 p. rrt.
The brother maintains Jhat Bowers al
lowed his wife to retain possession of a
bankbook calling for $3000 In the Hlbernla
Bank \ until recently, when, after a . dls
agreement, he took the book from her
by force and she threatened to get even.
The relatives also allege that the money
was in Bowers' name, but that during
the illness his wife Induced him to place,
it as community money.
Both Harry: Bowers and his wife as-
Berted that they believed that it was not
ptomaine poisoning that caused the death
of their relative, but some subtle drug
administered with malice.
The widow of the deceased cpuld not
be found at her residence last evening.
William Meyers, who conducts a saloon
at 231 Fifth street, stated last night that
Bowers had told him that his Illness was
caused by ham purchased by himself and
that his wife had also suffered after hav
ing eaten a portion of it.
A searching Investigation into the cause
Of the death of Martin L. Bowers, a
bridge builder, who died at the German
hospital yesterday afternoon after a
mysterious illness of several weeks, will
be made by the detectives and officials of
the Coroner's office. Harry E. Bowers
and Sadie Bowers, brother and BiÂ»ter-inÂ»
law, respectively, of the dead man, ap
peared at the Coroner's office last even
ing and made allegations that the de
ceased came to his death by the adminis
tration of a poison so subtle, in its nature
as to cause a lingering illness covering
a period <Jf eleven weeks.
Professor Fortier is working under an
appropriation of $10,000 made by the Gov
ernment and the State for Investigation
of the irrigation systems of California,
with the deeign of assisting the farmers,
erchardlsts and dairymen.
ThÂ« farmers have learned that crowing al
falfa by Irritation is much more remunerative
than growing wheat and rye without irriga
tion. They can raise four and five crops of
alfalfa at.-.;i.n one of the other. Alfalfa is
one of the best dairy foods, and I notice that

The Mufteeto Canal has not yet been opened,
but It will be as ajon as the Tuolumne River
rises. The Turiock Canal taps the Tuolumne

t*p B1.000 acres of land. There will bÂ« torn*
trouWe with it at first from seepage, but that
Â¦will be overcome for a while.
Professor Fortier arrived in that re
gion too late to observe all the ramifica
tions of its great irrigation systems, but
he eaw enough to convince him that they
ere of Immense value to the State and
constantly increasing la Importance.
When the canal* are la a condition to be
tapped again he purpose* to revisit the
district and make some practical sugges
tions for the benefit of the fanners and
slryraen there. Of his observations Pro
feesor Fortier says:
I found the Turlock Irrigation â¢ystem to be
xv*ll ordered. It is more popular than it was
at first and t>U litigation is stopped. Tho*e
who fought it the hardest and attacked the
bends s re new Us friends. '. The acreage lrri-
K*i*d br the canal is increasing every year.
l.iin year TOOO acres were Irrigated, this year
12.000 and next year they estimate that it will
be 20, 000 acre*.

My husband and I have not been living In
harmony for eome time. He haa proved un
faithful, and for hia wrong I have begun di
vorce proceedings against him.
Yesterday he came to the house and after
procuring the keys from tho servant stated
that he intended taking charge of the prem
ises While we were talking In the hallway
the "door-bell ranc and I went to answer it.
In the meantime he entered the back parlor,
and going to a desk unlocked the drawer in
whlch^I keep the money and procured $100. I
demanded that he return the money, but he
refused. I then called in my brother and Mr.
Hutler, who is acting as my attorney, to as
sist me, and we succeeded in securing the re
turn of a portion of the money. He then left
the house, threatening to return with rein
forcements. ,
My husband and I have lived apart for
some time but this is the first time he ha*
asserted any right* to the house or interfered
with me in its management.
Although somewhat chagrined by hia
temporary defeat, he announced that he
would carry the matter into the courts
to-day, and intimated that he might have
Attorney Butler arrested for battery.
Discussing the affair last evening. Mrs.
Ashmore was at first disposed to pooh
pooh the suggestion of a quarrel, but
finally consented'to talk, giving, her side
of the affair with a bit of coloring. She
said:
That Aahmore had been badly handled
was evidenced by his ruttled appearance
as he sained the sidewalk and a few
bruises he had received from his wife,
whose attack he had not resented with
the physical force at his command.
THE.EATENS ARREST.
Accepting the advice, he engaged the
services of a friend, and they started on!
for what later proved a scene of a lively
encounter between husband wife. Ap
parently Mrs. Ashmore had anticipated
his. coming. Ashmore, arriving at the
lodging-house, immediately endeavored to
assert his rights by removing the cash
from the drawer. He had barely con
cealed it in his pockets; however, before
his wife appeared on the scene and a
second later thev were mixing It In a
lively manner. It was at thitf st^ge of
the proceedings that Attorney Butler, rep
resenting Mrs. Ashmore, and her big
brother heralded their presence by fall
ing upon the husband, whom they forced
into a room and throwing him on to a
bed proceeded to recover the cash he had
taken from^the till.
Several times, as the struggle proceed
ed. Aehmore tried to draw a pistol and
finally succeeded, but an effort to use it
proved unavailing, for, as was afterward
discovered, a 10-cent piece had Blipped into
the aperture adjoining the chamber and
prevented the operating of the trigger.
After a hard tussle the wife managed to
secure about half of the money which
her husband had taken from the cash
drawer, and then a truce was declared.
Ashmore was released . from the grip of
his antagonists and was permitted to re
join his friend, who awaited him on the
sidewalk.
The Ashmores have not been living hap
pily for some time. While sharing the
same roof and the profits of the lodging
house, Mrs. Ashmore some months ago
saw fit to isolate her husband In an apart
ment fat from the one she occupies and
since then they have not been on speak
ing terms, except when they met once
a week to reckon -up the business of the
house and divide the revenue.
Yesterday Ashmore. who ia also en
gaged in the liauor business on Mont
gomery street, was unexpectedly served
with a summons in a suit for divorce
brought by his wife, in which she alleges
unfaithfulness on his part. He immedi
ately consulted his attorney, Thomas D.
Rlordan, who proceeded to instruct his
client on his community Interest rights
as bearing particularly on the Pearl lodg
ing-house. It was suggested to Ashmore
that he had better implant himself at
once behind the counter of the lodging
house office for the purpose of seeing
that his interests in the place were prop
erly cared for.
SECURES THE CASH.
Investigation developed the fact that W.
E. Ashmore and his wife, the latter as
sisted bv a brother and a lawyer, were
settling a family difficulty, which finally
ended in a division of honors and the coin
2f the lodging-house till, over which the
ispute had originated.
The screeches of an angry woman ln
harmonlously mingling with the gruffer
tones of several men's voices aroused the
neighborhood of Mission and Ninth streets
yesterday afternoon and readily suggested
to a large crowd which gathered in front
of the Pearl lodging-house, situated on
the northwest corner of the mentioned
streets, that something out of the ordi
nary was occurring within that . estab
lishment.

BAKER CITY. Ore., Aug. 23.-A lone
highwayman held up the .Whitney-Can
yon City stage at a lonely spot on the
mountain road three miles from Austin
station last evening: about 5 o'clock. Be
sides the stage driver there were two
passengers, Frank Donson of Everett,
Wash., and F. J. Armstrong of Portland.
The stage had Just reached the top of
a hill, when the highwayman sprang
from behind a log armed with a rifle, and
commanded the driver and passengers to
stop and throw up their hands. The rob
ber compelled the driver and passengers
to dismount and at the point of the gun
give up all their money, securing abou^t
$10 from Donson, $50 from Armstrong and
some change from the driver. He took'
out the- two mail pouches and told the
men to get back into the stage and move
on in a hurry. The robber remained
standing in the road until the stage wag
out of sight. He seemed to be an old
hand at the business.

fornia; of all varieties of redwood; burl
specimens that are the wonder of all tim
ber men; sixty examples of the growth of
curly redwood; every forest tree of real
value is included by sample. Many fruit
trees and walnut trees are also on the
long and comorehenslve list.
Application has been made for space
in the forestry department for the Cali
fornia show of woods. The intention of
the commissioners Is to offer to St. Louis
as permanent exhibits, illustrative of
California forests, the greater specimens.
A novelty of arrangement will be that
the great tree mentioned will be cut up
so that it can be put together again at St.
Louis and so give unquestionable evi
dence of Its actual size and of its sound
ness.
The Asiatic passengers will include
forty-four Chinese from New York, who
are going back to their native land under
orders of deportation.
The Jspanese steamship America _Maru
will Ball to-day for the Orient with nearly
4000 tons of freight and CO cabin passen
gers. The cargo includes 2000 tons of
California flour. 1000 bales of sheeting and
some heavy machinery, the latter for
Shanghai. She will also take treasure
valued at $75,000.

There is every, prospect that the ex
hlblton of California woods at the St.
Louis Exposition will be tbe most satis
factory ever made anywhere. It is the
opinion of lumber men ' that the great
timbers and sections of trees will be ad
mired . by - people from all parts of the
world. - The variety will be large. . '
Among the wonders to be shown are a
log of spruce 44 feet long by 22 inches
square, a spruce tree five feet in diameter
and 100 feet long, a spruce plank four feet
thick, eleven "feet wide and sixty feet
long. There will be a great collective ex
hibit of the representative woods of Cali
fornia. ;
The credit of getting together this great
show of woods belongs to "W. H. Mills,
chief of the forestry division of the Cali
fornia exhibit. Mr. Mills has, however,
met with enthusiastic co-operation on
the part; of. the timber men of California,
and he speaks of them in praise.
J. N. Durney. of Siskiyou County has
volunteered to supply one of the mon
ster exhibits. The California Sugar ana
White Pine Agency, which includes twen
ty-eight great lumber companies of this
State, has with equal enthusiasm re
sponded to th'e invitation of Mr. Mills
and has agreed to do everything that
can be asked for the proper representa
tion of this State at St. Louis as a tim
ber growing country. Mr. Durney and
the agency offer to give' their services
and their lumber free of cost. Mr. Mills
ls of opinion' that the Southern Pacific
Company will move the great exhibits to
St. Louis free, in view of the advertise
ment for-the soil and climate of Califor
nia which they will present to all . ob
servers.
. The 60-foot plank will be polished on
one side. In. addition to the large ex
hibits there will be many others that will

St. Louis Wool Market.
Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
I Â¦ Potatoes continue to arrive freely, and aa
the demand for shipping Is somewhat limited
the market has an easier tone. A considerable
portion of the receipts from the river districts
are of poor quality and several sales are re
ported below the quotations. Fancy offerings
In boxes from the river and good Salinas Bur
banks are In demand for local use and read
ily command full figures. Sweet Potatoes are
coming forward rapidly and prices are stead
ily decllfiingr. Onions are easy, with supplies
plentiful and the demand moderate, both for
local and shipping purposes.
Supplies of vegetables were plentiful, and
with the exception of Tomatoes, which were
lower prices showed but Blight variation. Re
ceipts' of both bay and river Tomatoes were
liberal, and as the demand was rather light
prices 'had a further decline. Some exception
ally fine lots of the river article sold at a slight
advance over the quotations at the stores, but
the maximum quotation was an extreme fig
ure for the best offerings on the wharf. The
receipts from . across the bay camo to hand
too late for the regular trade and there was
quite a surplus unsold at the close. Green
Corn continued to sell at unsteady prices, most
of the receipts being of poor quality. â¢ String,
Wax and Lima Beans were In free supply and
only the very best offerings received any at
tention. Pickle Cucumbers were offering
freely and cleaned up quickly under a 3teady
demand from packers. Trading In other vege
tables was moderately active and prices were

Eastern Livestock Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 25.-The semi-stagnation
of the stock market vat unrelieved to-day and
the dealings were In smaller volume than yes
terday. There was some revival of activity
toward the last and the market closed strong.
The majority of the stock* which made up the
great bulk of the trading left off 1 to 2 points
higher than last night. The strong features
were Missouri Pacific. St. Paul, Atchison.
Amalgamated Copper and Tenneisee Coal.
There was no news to explain the advancing
tendency of the market, and the true cause
peemed to be that the room traders reached the
limit of their ability to depress prices yester
day and so covered their short contracts. At
tention was wholly diverted to the yacht race
throughout the day. There was a large list of
absent members and those on the floor spent
their time watching the bulletins of the races.
Morning report* from London showed come, dis
position to buy American stocks there and the
opening advance here was in sympathy. Erie
waa conspicuously in demand for London ac
count. The development of this foreign de
mand is of special interest In Its bearings on
the exchange situation. There was large re
selling o. foreign holdings of our securities,
taken at the bottom of the decline when the
rally hens ehowed signs of culminating and
the renewal of the demand on the reaction has
not yet assumed Important proportions The
eauler tone in to-day'* exchange market was
largely due to the appearance in that market
of bankers finance bills, which are connected
with borrowing abroad. The fortign banking
houses, in New York a'so. are on important
source of supply for funds In the time money
market- The present abundance of call loan
funds is largely caused by the placing on de
posit of trust company funds with the banks
to secure the Interest- on deposit accounts
which Is higher than the present call loan rate'
Any rise In the call loan rate would be prompt
ly followed by the withdrawal of those trust
company depoeits from banks for placing In the
call loan market, which would necessitate a
shirting flood of accounts of banks alsrf and
tome probable disturbance In the money mar
ket. Tbig contingency la a repressive Influence
on the stock market speculation Just now
There is anxiety also over the closing .up of the
cotton corner, which, it is generally believed,
la yet to be achieved, and which will necesÂ«a
rfly be an operation of tsume peril. Many ru
mor* are still prevalent of efforts making by
large industrial corporations to secure tempo
rary loan*. The recent heaviness of New York
Central, which was a depressing factor for a
time this morning, also eeems to be explained
by the petition to the Stock Exchange to list
$0,000,000 and $6,000,000 additional general
mortgage bonds. These are In connection. with
the continuing operation of the company's re
funding plan. The weekly crop bulletin wu ,

though quotations show no further change.

fruit, with Peaches leading in point of demand

good condition for sellers all arojnd, without
any particular speculation. Prunes are quiet,
though some transactions are being made.
Nuts, too, are in very fair demand for the
East. Honey remains as before quoted, with
holders, both here and In the country, firm.

The fruit market was amply supplied and
although the demand for some descriptions
was more active there was not much change
in prices. There were very few canning Pears
or Plums on the market and the canneru
were uaylncr more attention to Peaches and
choice lota of clingstones met with prompt sals
at firmer rates. The crop of Peaches and
Pears along the Sacramento River Is about ex
hausted, but receipts from other sections are
liberal. -'Peaches in small boxes and carriers
were in demand at firm prices. Choice free
stones from -the mountain districts sold well
at ti.Vjf75c per box. while 80c ' was considered
a top figure ior offerings . from other sections.
Plums and Prunes were Plentiful and easy,
there .being very little Inquiry for -shipping.
Fine Apples * in 4-tler boxes and good hard
Bartlett Pears suitable for shipping were In
demand at full figures, but small Apples and
ripe Pears were abundant and easy. Fips
were In light receipt, and as offerings were
of good quality prices ranged higher. Â¦ There
was not much doing In table Grapes and prices
had little change. Wine Grapes sold slowly.
Another consignment of about 200 boxes came
in from Antioch. Cantaloupes and Nutmeg
Melons arrived freely and sold at a wide range
as to quality.' There were no changes in Ber
ries. Receipts were light and except for strict
ly fancy offerings the demand . was likewise.
Citrus and Tropical fruits were; dull and feat
ureless, v.ith supplies of all kinds plentiful.
Receipts of Prunes in this market are rather
light, due chiefly to the high prices being paid
In the growing districts. Reports from Los
Gatos say that green Prunes for drying pur
poses are firm at $25 per ton, having advanced
from $17. â¢ - Â¦ ,

CHICAGO. Aug. 25 -The wheat market was
rather dull and quiet, with little outside trad
ing. There was a fairly steady opening on
the early weather reports from the Northwest
and a falling off of receipts in the same
quarter. The early weakness In corn, how
ever, caused bearishness and considerable
wheat came out, with a paucity ol buying
orders September opened a shade lower ' to
Vic higher at 80%(gS0%c. sold at_ 80%c and
declined with momentary rallies to i9%@<9%c.
The close was barely steady at a loss of
%@%c at 7U%c. December closed %Â®%c
lower at 80%c, having sold down from 81%@
MSc, the opening figure.
Improved crop reports and a continuation of
good growing weather brought out consid
erable corn and a weak market ensued. Sep
tember closed %@%c lower at 60%@50%c.
starting at 51c and selling ud %c early. De
cember was down %c at 50%c, ranging be
tween 60%@50?ic to 6154c.
There was an easier feeling In oats, due
to eelllng by commission houses In sympathy
with corn. Late liquidation by lonÂ«s added
to the weakness and September closed %@%c
lower at 34%@34Vic, after ranging between
that figure and 34 %c, the opening price. De
cember was down Vic at 35%c, the bottom
price after startinz at SC%c.
Provisions were fairly strong early, but the
strength did not hold. Selling by packers
caused a decline to below yesterday's prices.
September pork closed 22%c lower; lard off
22%c and ribs down 15c.

WHEAT FREIGHTSâ Spot business contin
ues light at 15s 6dÂ®16s 3d, usual European op
tions. The chartered wheat fleet in port has
a registered tonnage of 62,660, against 52,620
tons on the same date last year; disengaged,
105,100 tons, against 45,800; on the way to this
port, 304.100yV>nB, against 256,400.
WHEATâ iparls futures were higher and Liv
erpool futures lower. Bradstreet's gave the
world's visible supply an increase of 503,000
bushels.
Chicago was %c lower.' There was some buy-
Ing on rains In the Northwest, but the market
was without snap and speculative trade was
still apathetic. The Chicago wires of Bolton,
De Ruyter & Co. said: "It Is extremely dull
in a speculative way. Trade Is awaiting
development as to the movement, In Â¦ the West
ern crop and the demand for It. In the mean
time weakness In corn creates a moderate sell
ing pressure. There is no change In previous
conditions of supply and demand. Receipts are
running way, below, last year and demand is
good for all wheat coming into sight. St. Louis
reports millers withdrawing from store. Cash
premiums everywhere well maintained. So far
as appearances indicate demand for the North
western crop as It comes to market will be of
the same character. Cables report damaging
rains In the United Kingdom and on the Conti
nent. German crop likely to be of poor quality
and there Is much apprehension as to damage
to French crop. The root crops In the United
Kingdom will be indifferent. Minneapolis re
ports an increasing demand for flour. Distrib
uters of flour. tell Us that stocks In' all hands
are email; that the Southwestern millers sold
ahead and are having difficulty getting wheat
.to fill their orders, except at advancing prices.'
On these conditions we see nothing very invit
ing In the outlook for the s,hort seller. We
would rather take our , chances on the Jong
elde."
Quotations in this market have made . no'
noteworthy change for a fortnight, and the
situation remains as before.

In the letters to his wife White asks for
the loan of thousands of dollars. It
will be proved that Mrs. White lent her
husband large sums, which were not re
turned. The case has been hanging fire
for four years. Depositions have been
taken all over the East, apd when the
case was set for hearing here a number
of times something arose that necessitated
a postponement?
Six months before his death \WhIte
bought an annuity policy from the New
York Mutual Life Insurance Company, for
which he paid $50,000. He was to have re
ceived $3000 a year so long as he lived. He
died -before the payment of the first an
nuity.
An effort will be made this afternoon to
show that when Mrs. White married she
was possessed of an independent fortune
of $30,000, and this money was used by
White in building his own fortune. The
lawyers will claim that when White mar
ried he had nothingâ that he was 'em
ployed in C. C. Curtln's dry goods house
as clerk and never had a penny.
They will attempt to prove that White
induced his wife to go East in order that
he might go into the society, of ! other
women. The attorneys say they will not
mention the women who lived with White
at the time, as they have since married.
They will show, that while his wife was
away, he secured a divorce from her on
the ground of desertion. The case will be
remarkable.
So clever was "White in his deception
that the wife might not have been ap
prised of the divorce proceedings had It
not been for the untimely taking off of
her husband.
The evidence shows that the Whites
were married in San Jose on the 31st day
of May, 18S3, by the Rev. Dr. Sims, pastor
of the Methodist Episcopal Church South.
White secured a divorce In November,
1884, while his wife was In New York.
While the divorce proceedings were under
way he wrote her endearing letters." The
following Is an. extract from one of the
many letters sent Mrs. White:
The truth is. I am tired and disgusted with
everything here, but thank God. twelve months
won't be long passed until I am where every
honest home is happy.
Another letter contains the following
paragraph:
I wish you would try to make something out
of brother Joe and make a good sensible boy
out of him. I know one man In this city that
when you took hold of him you made a good
man out of him
"When Mrs. Jennie White takes the wit
ness stand in Judge Troutt's court this
afternoon her attorneys will hand her a
score of letters to identify in order that
they may put them in evidence to prove
that her hsband, the late Jonathan Lloyd
"White, who was killed while trying to res
cue some women when the Baldwin Hotel
was destroyed, led a dual life.
At the very time White was taking
steps to secure a divorce he was writing
her endearing letters. According to the
attorneys for the wife the divorce was se
cured by fraud, and the wife, who is now
striving to secure a portion of the big
estate, never knew that she was a Â¦ di
vorced woman until many years after the
decree.

The demands already passed by the
Board of Supervisors on the fund of
$36,000 for the fiscal year 1903-1304 are In
dividually for small amounts, but Audi
tor Baehr wants the point as to whether
the urgent necessity of the bill incurred
should govern in its payment to be set
tled for all time. The demands, payment
of which have been withheld by Baehr,
are:
four demands, aggregating more than
$4500 on the fund.
Now Auditor Baehr has consulted with
his attorney, who agrees with him that
the Intent of the charter framers was
that the fund should ; be used only for
urgent necessities as the name indicates.
Baehr is of the opinion that an urgent
necessity would mean, for example, the
burning down of a city institution and
he thinks there should be some fund to
draw on in the event that such a thing
were to happen. The expenditure of the
fund is not hampered in any way by the
one-twelfth act of the charter, so that
the money could be expended In one lump
sum if a real case of urgent necessity
did arise. Baehr is now waiting for the
written opinion of his attorney and upon
its receipt he will send a communication
to the Board of Supervisors explaining
his attitude on the question.

VISITOR FBOM MERCED
It appeared only to be a question of
how much was left In the fund, and at
one meeting on July 13, 1903, the Board of
Supervisors passed no less than thlrty-
Auditor Baehr, after a long inquiry into
the subject, has arrived at the conclusion
that the demand to be paid out of the
urgent . necessity fund must have some
semblance of 1 the name Implied and be
lieves ft time to call a halt on the prac
tice of drawing on the fund simply be
cause it has an existence.
Several months ago the Finance Com
mittee asked the City Attorney whether
the Board of Supervisors* could not estab
lish a "miscellaneous fund," upon which
to draw when no other fund was avail
able. The committee realized that many
of the demands passed did not come
within the purview of an urgent neces
sity, and thought that other means should
be taken to pay the demands legally.
Lane held that the charter designated
the various funds of the municipality
and that an addltfonaJ fund could not be
created. After the receipt of the opinion
the Board of Supervisors kept on passing
demands on the urgent necessity fund.
It has been the custom to draw upon
the fund almost up to the last cent. Dur
ing the fiscal year 1902-1903 demands ag
gregating $35,378 65 were drawn, leaving
an unexpended balance of $621 35. Among
the demands passed were one of $1000 for
a filing case for the Supervisors; one
for $1430 for plumbing in the Bush street
engine house; another for $80 for horse
hire and still another of $31 25 for rat
traps. Clearly these items, according to
Auditor Baehr. are not urgent necessities,
yet the demands were audited last year
because It has been the custom to do so.
PASS MANY DEMANDS.
NECESSITY MUST EXIST.
There appears to be a difference of
opinion between the members of the Su
pervisors' Finance Committee, which au
thorizes the payment of demands on the
fund named, and Auditor Baehr. The
committee holds that It has ample" power
to pay any demand provision for which
has not been made in the budget. It has
never concerned itself with whether the
purpose for which the bill was, incurred
was an urgent necessity or not, but sim
ply ordered the. bill paid if it could not
be legally drawi* upon one of the other
funds created by. the charter and desig
nated in the budget.
Auditor Baehr has made up his mind
to prevent further raids on the "Urgent
Necessity Fund" for the payment of de
mands which he" holds cannot be legally
drawn on the fund named. To that' end
Baehr- has "pigeon holed" twenty-one de
mands against the fund which have been
passed by the Board of Supervisors pend
ing a written opinion from- his legal ad
viser regarding his interpretation of. the
section of the charter relating to the
subject.
The section referred to provides that
"the Supervisors may appropriate thirty
six thousand dollars a year for 'urgent
necessities,' not otherwise provided for
by law. No money shall be paid out of
thl3 appropriation unless authorized by a
five-sixths vote of all the members of
the Board of Supervisors and approved by
the Mayor."
City Official "Withholds Payment on
Twenty-One Demands Pending
Settlement of the Dis
puted Point.
"You'll get no kind of a permit," said
Casey, and "We'll give you a rattle on
this injunction," said Manson.
Then the company desired to secure a
permit to build the foundation of ' the
building only, but was met with. a stern
refusal on the part of Casey and Manson.
The contract had been let and the con
tractors are out some $600 on account of
the action of the two Commissioners in
refusing a permit, which Ach claims they
have no right to deny, as it does not in
any way concern the height of the build
ing. Ach was compelled to sue out a writ
of injunction against the board so that
he can proceed with the work. Ach par
ticularly objects to the remarks of Casey
and Manson when he was seeking his sec
ond permit.
Commissioner Schmitz' now comes for
ward with Connolly's story that when Sy
ron called out to him, Connolly
was in reality working on the scaf
fold, but refused to answer because
Syron is not his superior. Schmitz de
clares that Casey Is again doing politics
by. attempting to discharge a man simply
because he is a friend of Mayor Schmitz,
and he will interpose a vigorous protest
against ousting a man who he says is
competent and faithful.
Henry Ach, attorney for the Pacific Au
tomobile Company, has a grievance
against Commissioner s Casey and Man
son over the latter's refusal to issue a
permit for the construction of the founda
tion of a building at the corner of Oc
tavia street and Golden Gate avenue. The
Board of Supervisors granted the com
pany a permit to erect a building four
feet In excess of the legal height, but the
Board of Works refused to approve the
permit. Suit was then brought by the
company and the matter is being argued
in the courts.
The war clouds are again hovering
above the Board of Public Works because
of the suspension of J. J. Connolly, a plas
terer, by President Casey for alleged
neglect of duty. Commissioner, Schmitz
is mad clear through because he was no*
consulted about the matter, although as
Superintendent of Public Buildings he
has immediate supervision of the plas
terers and mechanics employed by the
board. As a consequence Schmitz threat
ens to make things warm at this morn-
Ing's meeting of the board when the sus
pension will be considered. .
On Monday last Head Janitor Syron was
making his rounds in the City Hall corri
dor and discovered, according to his
story, that Connolly was not working as
ho had been detailed. He called for Con
nolly, who was supposed to be on a high
scaffold, but received no reply. Syron
immediately went to President Casey and
reported that Connolly was neglecting his
work. Casey at once ordered the follow
ing letter to be sent to Connolly:
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug." 24, 1003.
J. J. Connolly, Plasterer: You are hereby no
tified that you have been suspended from fur
ther duty and ordered to appear at the meeting
