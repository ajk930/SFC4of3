ST. LOUIS, Nov. 1Lâ Dispatches re

Leavitt and his bride, who up to a few
weeks ago was Ruth Bryan, are happy in
the receipt of a check for $200 from the
bride's father, William J. Bryan, which
.the. genial Nebraskan sent them, for
spending money.
Mr. and Mrs.' Leavitt are visiting at the
country home of Thomas J. Alken, the
St. Louis 'politician, at Humans vlile, Mo.
Their stay. It is said, -will be prolonged
indefinitely. Leavitt, whose home la at
Newport, R. I., is a portrait painter and
finds little demand for his talent at Hu
mansville. According to the dispatches,
the young couple were so madly in love
that they forgot to be practical and they
married without fortifying themselves
against the financial distress which is
said to have overtaken them.
Dr. M. Dwlght Jennings of this city, a
cousin of Mrs. Leavitt's ' father, William
Jennings Bryan, said to-night:
.. "I know nothing about the reported
poverty of my romantic young cousin, but
presume it is not unlikely that it Is true.
The young lady's father â¢ is not a" man
who is likely to change his mind. I have
never seen Mr. Leavitt nor any member
of the Bryan family since the wedding.
The fact that Mr. Leavitt is poor,'how
ever, need not interfere In the least with
their happiness, it seems to me. I hope
that he is a good artist at any rate
there, won't be much romance In my fair
cousin's sacrifice if it turns out that her
husband was originally cut out for a sign

By a fatal coincidence, this wag the
very expression which had been employed
in the first bulletin published regarding
the malady of the Emperor Frederick.
BERLIN, Nov. 11.â A painful tragedy
is at tbe present moment being played
within the walls of the royal palace at
Potsdam. For years past the Emperor
has been haunted by a fixed idea that he
would die of the same malady as his
father and mother.
When, two months ago, he began to
complain of a pain In his throat, ter
rible anxiety seized the Empress and her
children. She summoned Dr. von Leut
hold and asked him to examine her hus
band, without, however, exciting his anx
iety. ' The first examination only showed
the existence of a number of granula
tions. The Emperor, nevertheless, be
came more somber and more taciturn.
He spoke less and had fewer of those ac
cesses of {he charming, frank gayety
which render his company so agreeable.
Horltz Schmidt, after an examination,
diagnosed a tumor of the vocal chords.

the Empress that, far from reassuring
her, ' this medical expression only "aug

General Leonard Wood to be major gen

pose confirmation because he believes in
the Innocence of his friend, Estes G.
Rathbone, whom General Wood sent to

There is no question that the Demo

General Wood, who is one of the Presi

now in command of the Department of
the South Philippines. All those who are

The Senate to-day received a number

Smoot of Utah remaining in the Senate.
In presenting a numerously signed peti

consideration of Â¦ the charges against
Smoot, Hoar took occasion to remind the
senders of petitions bearing upon Smoot's
case that the proceeding was out of order
and improper. He based his remarks upoji
the fact that the determination of Smoot's
rights â¢vfould be a purely judicial proceed
ing, to be determined by the laws and
the constitution of the United States.
"With all Oue respect to the signers of
petitions of this character," he said, "I
want to say to them that their petitions
are as much out of place when addressed
to this court as similar petlt'ons would
be if addressed to the Supreme Court of

It Is given out by a Democratic Senator

efforts will be to establish the truth of
the report longvin circulation that Sena
tor" I?annSt~and~t > err>*S. Heath, as chair
man and secretary, respectively, of tEe
Republican National Committee, pledged
Immunity to Mormons, so far as Congress
and the Government in Washington were
concerned, on condition that the electoral
vote of Utah be given to the Republican
party In 1900.
This allegation has been repeatedly
made by Democrats and anti-Mormons of
the West during the past three years,
but, except for an Impassioned speech de
livered In the Senate by Senator Rawlins
of Utah when news reached Washington
of the election of Kearns as Senator, the
accusation has never been publicly made
in Washington.
An effort also will be made by Carlisle
to prove that Senator Smoot practices
polygamy, In spite of his strenuous de
nials.
The Call correspondent, however, is in

POLITICS IN THE CRUSADE.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.- John G.
Carlisle, former Secretary of' the Treas
ury, has been employed by leaders of the
opposition to the- seating of Reed Smoot
as Senator from Utah to conduct the in
vestigation of that case before the Com
mittee on Privileges and Elections. An
nouncement to this effect was made this
afternoon by a Democratic member of the
Senate committee before which efforts are
now* being made to have the case of
Smoot brought as early as possible. Who
is to pay the large fee Carlisle is said to
have demanded is not definitely known
and this appears to increase Interest*
In the affair, because it tends to hold an
air of mystery which indicates that the
movement for the unseating of the Mor
mon Senator is growing In strength and
determination.
Special Dispatch to The Call
In regard to the situation In Macedonia,
he said that Russia stood firmly for the
maintenance of peace and order in the
disturbed provinces o* the Turkish em
pire and would Insist upon a restoration
of order and good government there.
"Now, however, the whole incident is
settled and, let us hope, in its grave,"
he concluded.
"But the feeling has been somewhat
strained In the last few months." he said,
"on account of the Klshenev incident."
The refusal of the Russian Government
to receive the American petition could
be easily understood, he said, by imag
ining: with what spirit a petition from
Russians In regard to the negro troubles
In the South would be received.
Speaking then of his own attitude, he
deojnred that he had gone to Washington
prepared to become a firm friend- of the
United States, but was astonished to find
in some quarters a feeling of enmity
which had made his few months thero
rather uncomfortable. He was apparently
believed by some, he said, to be an ad
herent of the Macchivelllan school of
diplomacy, whereas, on the contrary, he
believed that perfect frankness was an
essential In diplomatic affairs, especially
toward tjie United States, with which
Russia had been on terms of long con
tinued friendship and purposed to con
tinue the good relationship which had al
ways existed.
â¢ Not only was the Russian Government
friendly but the same feeling existed
among the Russian people, and an Ameri
can Bishop with whom he had talked
after a stay of several months In Russia
had commented on this.
NEW YORK, Nov. 11.â Before depart
ing for Washington to-day Count Cassini,
the Russian Embassador, was shown a
dispatch from Paris Intimating that M.
Nellndorff, until recently Russian Embas
sador at Rome, probably would be trans
ferred to the vacant post at Paris, in
connection with which Count Cassinl's
name has been mentioned. He expressed
no surprise, saying that he had heard of
the matter while in Paris, and continued
with a statement of his pleasure la re
turning to Washington, which, he said,
"is now regarded as one of the most 'im
portant posts In the Russian diplomatic
service."
COUNT CASSINI RETURNS.
"It is declared herÂ© that the- 400 troops
ordered to Moukden were sent there sole
ly for the purpose of restoring order. No
other measures have been taken."
Russia's demand for the recall of tha

patches from Tientsin and Shanghai,
Viceroy Yuan Shi Kal and General Ma
have Informed the throne that 45,000 men
are ready to take the field against the
Russians In Manchuria and that they are
prepared to march on Sunday next.
The Berlin correspondent of the Stand

authority that the Czar of Russia told
Emperor William during their recent In

declare war against Japan under any con
ditions.
TIENTSIN, Nov. 11.â Admiral Alcxleff.
the Russian Viceroy of the Far East, will

report that the Russian capital of the Far
East is to be removed from Port Arthur
to Vladivostok Is unfounded.
Special Dispatch to The Oa.lL
PROVIDENCE. R. I.. Nov. 1Lâ That the
action of the Fall River mills will be
followed quite generally in this State and
Eastern Connecticut is considered a prac
tical certainty, as Rhode Island mills
have invariably followed the lead of those
at Fall Paver. There are about 25,000
hands employed In the mills in the Black
etor.e and Pawtucket valleys.
Representatives of the labor unions in
Fall River and other cities do r.ot appear
to expect any concerted action on the
part of the unions in opposition to the
new schedule. The union men have kept
themselves well informed as to the cotton
market and to-day's announcement at
Fall River occasioned little surprise.
While rot admitting the necessity for so
sweeping a reduction It is doubtful If
any considerable number would Join in a
fight with the mill atrents at this time.
BACK TO FORMER SCHEDULE
Although tha outlook at Fall River
from the operatives' standpoint is a rather
gloomy one. It should be remembered
that the new schedule Is really a return
to the conditions existing two years ago,
when an advance was made by the man
ufacturers. It was this advance in Fall
River which led to the great strike in
lÂ«owell l?.st spring. The Lowell operatives
demanded the Fall River schedule, which
was refused.
The scale went Into effect en March 13,
1902. The price for weaving regular goods
to-day is 21. 7S cents per cut, and a 10
per cer.t reduction would make the new
price 19-6 cents. The old price, previous
to the date given, was 13.8 cents, and this
latter figure will prevail after Novem
ber Z2.
In Taunton. the Corr Manufacturing
Company has already announced a 10 per
cent reduction, and while the mill men at
New Bedford, Lowell and Lawrence are
reticent concerning: their plans, they ad
mit that the condition of the cotton mar
ket is all against the manufacturers. It
is believed to be equivalent to saying that
a wage reduction is something to be seri
cus'y considered.
TWO STATES NOT AFFECTED.
The situation in Maine and New Hamp
shire will hardly be affected. Maine did
pot share in the wage advance of two
}cears ago and so has a negative ad
vantage nor.'.
The mill agents at Manchester, N. H.,
Â¦which Is one of the largest cotton manu
facturing centers in the country, say that
retrenchment has not been thought of
so far.
BOSTON, Nov. 11.â Reports from the
centers of the cotton mill industry
throughout New England indicate that
to-day's announcement at Fall Iliver that
a. 13 per cent reduction in wages had b?en
decided upon by the cotton manufacturers
there, to go into effect en November 22,
has caused general uneasiness, owing to
ihe belief that an equal reduction at
other places is inevitable. It is considered
that this nill be the case in Rhode Island
Â«.nd Eastern Connecticut, and it is be
lieved other cities in Eastern Massachu
setts WlH follow the example set by Fall
River, though conditions are somewhat
dissimilar.

NEW YORK. Nov. 11.â At the office of
J. P. Morgan & Co. to-day it was said
that Morgan had no intention whatever
of retiring from active business life.
LONDON, Nov. 11.â The report to the
effect that J. Plerpont Morgan proposed
to retire from active business was given
prominence here and the weakness of
Americans on the Stock Exchange was
attributed thereto, though the operators
were somewhat skeptical as to the truth
of the rumors.
"The king of trusts." "the Morganlzer
of the world," "the financial Titan," are
a few of the titles bestowed on Morgan
by the papers which comment on the re

Morgan's London housÂ© declares the re

MOB DRIVES CHINESE
OUT OF SOULSBYVILLE
Asiatics Are Transported to Sonora
by a Crowd of Determined
Union Miners.
TUOLUMNE, Nov. 1L-A mob of 200
men, composed of Summerville and Souls
byville union miners, have run the Chi
nese out of the Black Oak mine and the
town of Soulsbyville. The Chinese were
transported to Sonora. There was no vio
lence.
SONORA, Nov. 11.â The Black Oak mine
at Soulsbyville was shut down yesterday,
and to-day thÂ© pumps were taken from
the lower level. Trouble has been brew-
Ing for some time on account of the em
ployment of Chinese as ore samplers.
About 150 minerB from the Soulsbyville
and Tuolumne unions, headed by Murray,
president of the Soulsbyville union, and
Godette, an agitator, went to thÂ© mine In
a. body and demanded that the superin
tendent agree to employ no more Chinese.
He refused to accede to their demand.
The delegation then escorted thÂ© Chinese
cook, thÂ© only remaining Chinese, out of
the camp and sent him here.
The mine owners are determined to keep
the mine shut down for an indefinite pe
riod.- ;,-.; ;, .
The closing down of this famous mine
will work a hardship on the business men
of Soulsbyville, as there were employed
at tho mine about eighty men,' most of
whom have families. It is generally un
derstood that the majority of the mem
bers of the Soulsbyville union were op
posed to Interfering with tne Black. Oak
mine, as the company has always treated
its employes well, paying top wages and
furnishing single men with cabins, stoves,
wood and electric lights free.

MOTOBMAN BISKS LIFE
TO SA.VE WOMAN
Erave Brooklyn Car Han Stops a
Runaway Horse, but Is Fatally
Injured.
NEW YORK, Nov. II.â Joseph Johnson,
motorman of a Brooklyn trolley car, has
probably sacrificed his life to save an un
known woman and two children from
death under the feet of a runaway horse.
Me is now in a hospital with a fractured
fkull and one leg broken. The doctors
eay he cannot possibly recover.
On its way to the Broadway ferries
Johnson's car had stopped to take on a
woman and two little children. They
were crossing from the sidewalk to the
rear steps of the car when Johnson, look
ing &hc-3d, saw a horse running wildly
toward the helpless woman. As it came
near he leaped out and seized the bridle,
throwing the horse to the sidewalk. The
motorman was dashed against a tree and
fell unconscious. The woman and chil
dren, who had stood transfixed with fear,
directly in the animal'B course, were not
injured.

PETER GUSCHES. McKean, hurt in

The accident occurred eleven miles from
this city and one mile south of McKean,
and was caused by the brakes on a car
of gravel becoming loose and allowing it
to run out from a side track, on w'hich it
had been placed, to the main track, where
there was a heavy down grade. While
running at a high rate of speed it met
and almost crashed through tne passen
ger car, which left Erie shortly after 6
o'clock, and which, as usual, was filled
with people who- had been in this city
shopping and attending Criminal Court.

SAN JOSE, Nov. 11.â The United States
Government will be urged through former
Congressman .Kahn to make financial
amends to Captain Peter McMillan of this
city for infringement on a patent on ar
mor plate for battleships .and fortifica
tions. Five years ago, after appropriating
$15,000 to test McMillan's Idea, the Gov
ernment .began using his methods on all
its battleships, but has made no offer to
reimburse 'the Inventor. The device is
covered by a patent granted in 1SS7.
McMillan's device holds the outer sheet
of armor in place by dovetail keys which
bind the two plates together instead of
bolting them to the frame of the ves
sel. By this method, instead of the
plates being broken when hit by a
shell, each Indentation of a shot binds
them tighter. The space between - the
plates are filled with a prepared packing.
McMillan's method requires but two
plates to cover a space that formerly took
twelve plates.
Although McMillan has asked the Gov
ernment officials to reimburse him for his
patent, they have refused to do anything.
Former Congressman Kahn . has now
taken up the matter and will try and se
cure payment for the inventor. Every
battleship built in the last five years has
the device on its armor, and the sum the
Government will be asked to pay will
amount to a large fortune.
McMillan is a veteran of the Civil "War,
and was also an officer In the English
army. He came to California from Mis
souri about six months ago. Among those
who have also interested themselves in
his invention are Congressman Barton
and Senators Cockerill and Vest of Mis
eouri.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 1Lâ When
Bunau-Varilla returned from
his conference with Secretarj
5f State Hay this afternoon he
said that he would be received
by the President on Friday as Minister
Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary
of the Republic of Panama to the United
States. This course, he said, would mark
the passage of the de facto government to
a State. Bunau-Varilla first will call at
the State Department and Secretary, Hay
will accompany him to the White House
and make the presentation. ' The cere
mony will occur in the blue room. These
details were arranged at the conference
this afternoon.
Bunau-Varilla said that he would cable
to his Government advising it not to al
low General Reyes to land unless he bore
full credentials as Colombia's Minister
Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary
to the Republic of Panama.
â¢ It Is stated here on authority that it is
too late for Colombia to make any ef
fort to resurrect the canal treaty with
the United States and beyond preventing
a hostile clash between Colombia and the
new Republic of Panama, the proposed
visit of General Reyes to Panama will be
without result. The same authority
points out that the United States Govern
ment, having recognized Panama as an in
dependent State, cannot now proceed to
negotiate with Colombia for any terms
for canal rights in a State over which
Colombia possesses no control, so any
future canal negotiations will be be
tween the United States Government and
the Government of the republic of Pan
ama.
The reply of the State Department to
the protest by Thomas Herran, the Co
lombian Charge d' Affaires, was forward
ed to him to-day. It was merely a for
mal acknowledgment that the protest had
been received.
The State Department has been in
formed that the two British steamers
which were detained at the port of Buena
Ventura by the Colombian Government
with the Intention of using them to
transport troops to the Isthmus have been
released and have left that port.
The State Department has received a
cablegram from United States Minister
Beaupre at Bogota, "dated November 9,' in
which the Minister reports that large
crowds were parading the streets on the
8th inst. crying, "Down with Marro
quin." There was a mass meeting/which
denounced the President and called for
a change of government. Hundreds gath
ered at the palace, and the orator, a
prominent general, called for the resig
nation of the President. The gathering
was dispersed by troops, several persons
being wounded; but there were no fatal
ities. The city was under martial law
and well guarded by soldiers. The lega
tion of the United States was under the
protection of the Government, but there
were no manifestations of hostile demon
strations. The residence of Lorenzo Mar
roquin (believed here to be a Senator and
sen of the President), has been attacked
with stones.

SAYS UNCLE SAM
USES HIS DEVICE
"WASHINGTON, Nov. 11.â Advices
reaching the "War Department from Ma
nila indicate that, before he "sails for the
United States on December 22 Governor
Taft will have succeeded in settling one
of the most vexatious problems connected
with the acquisition of "the Philippines,
the adjustment of the claims of the friars
for their extensive property holdings in
the islands. Negotiations to this end had
been in progress at Manila between Gov
ernor Taft and Monseigneur Guidi. the
Papal delegate, ever since the Governor's
return to the island from Rome. The
main obstacle to a settlement appears to
have been an issue between the Papal
delegate and the religious orders as to the
proportion of the purchase money, to be
paid by the insular Government, that was
â¢to be turned over 'to Rome. The friars
naturally desired to receive - the major
part of the allotment and when they
learned that the church insisted upon a
certain sum they sought to make good
.their own proportion by increasing the
sum total of the price demanded for fHe
Iand3. This raised the total up to about
$14,000,030, a sum entirely beyond any fig
ure which the insular Government was
willing to consider. Realizing that with
Governor Taft's departure the chances of
a settlement would become more remote
and suffering from the deprivation of
their lands without compensation month
after month, the church authorities have
brought pressure to bear upon the friars,
with the result that the insular Govern
ment expects to be able to acquire their
entire holdings in the Islands for a sum
approximating JS.OOO.OOO.

"WASHINGTON. JCov. 1Lâ Senator Hans
brough Introduced a bill In the Senate
xvhlch fcy Implication repeal3 the timber
cad stcr.e act, under which laiid is now
enquired nt $2 10 an acre regardless of its
rtal value. The measure is intended to
cure defects la existing laws, put a check
upon specuiadoa In timber lands and put
aa end to the frauds which recently have
grown into national scandaL It was re
ferred to the Committee on Public Landa,
of which the author Is chairaaa.
The Secretary of the Interior la author
ized under the tew bill to make examina
tions and estimates relative to tie quan
tity and value of the timber and stone on
the public lands and to have the right
t"> dispose of the same in such quantities
as may seem advisable to tie highest bid
ders.
This plan Is row pursued in the sale of
timber oa Indian lands in Minnesota. The
title to the land rexaalas in the Govern
ment, and the Secretary of the Interior
n.ay fix the limit of time In which the
turchaser of the right shall remove the
timber or stone. The right to cut the tim
ber and make it a merchantable quantity
1b made inalienable.
If Senator Hansbroug'h'a measure be
comes a law all the timber land on toe
public domain will be withdraw from en
try, and the Government will enter upon
the policv of disposing of Its timber at
the markrt value. One provision in the
lull prohibits the entry of these lands
v.nder the homestead or other land laws.
It is argued by Senator Hansbrough that
la leaving tho fee to the land in the Gov
ernment reforestation will take place and
the gale of timber will bo a source of
large revenue.
The second section of the bill amends
the lieti land cction so as to provide
vhen a settler whose entry falls within
a forest reserve selects another piece of
land in lieu of his original entry it must
bo more valuable for agricultural pur
poses than for timber or stone.
In the existing law many of the entry
tren who find themselves within a .forest
reserve cut and dispose of the timber on
the land and later go outside of the re
*tfvÂ« and file a homestead on other tim-
%land.
third section. of the bill amends the
act of March 11, 1901, and requires ail
jiroofs of commuted homestead and desert
land entries to be made before registers
und receivers in local land offices. This
jiropo^ed amendment to the existing law
is recommended by the Commissioner of
the General Land Office, who in his last
rÂ«port says:
"The privileges gained by the act have
h^en greatly abused, particularly by
United States Commissioners, who have
often be*-n parties to wholesale frauds in
X>roofe made before them."

CHICAGO, Nov. 11.â The friends of Roo
pan Dyeian. a your.g Armenian who has
been found dead in bed, are cf the opin
ion that he was murdered and class his
death with the assassinations of Armen
ians which have been taking place of late
in different parts of the old world.
Dyeian was suffocated by the gas which
rscaped from an open jet in his room,
ar.d the Coroner's inquest which investi
gated the affair declared that he had
cither committed suicide or had met death
accidentally, there being no direct evi
dence to support either theory.
It is said by pecple living in the flat
building in which Dyeian had taken
rooms with an Armenian family that on
two nights recently a strange man was
*Â»*n in the halls. It !s thought by the
friends of Dyeian that the man made his
way Into the room where the young man
was asleep ar.d turned on the gas.
Dyeian had but lately arrived In this
country and was compelled to leave his
native country on account of his identi
fication with the revolutionary party.

It was announced that this money Is
to be raised by a tax label to be put on

If every State represented in the na

The several adults who had witnessed

expecting to find two mangled corpses.
They found a little girl, crying and laugh
ing hysterically and smoothing the dress
of her baby brother. "You're not hurt,
are you, Jamie?" was all she could say.
The little folks live at Golden Gate,
near the tracks of the Berkeley local,
and an errand had called them to cross
the tracks. While the elder paused in
caution at the whistle the younger ven
tured between the glittering bands of
steel, despite his elster's warning, and
nearly caused the death of both.
Oakland Office. San Francisco Call,
â¢ ;. â¢ llijja^oadway, Nov' 11.
. Spurred by a grAtf necessity and actu
ated by a courage far beyond her years
and judgment, little 8-year-old Louise
McParland ran Into the open maw of
death yesterday to rescue her 4-year-old
brother James. Several adults stood
alongside the .track, and._sa,w. young
ster standing helpfjes)i at th'e 'approach of
a giant engine. Not so his little sister,
who had paused outside the danger line
while her baby brother, all unknowing,
wooed destruction in his toddling voyage
across the tracks. She warned him with
her voice, and, bewildered, he turned to
question her while the giant locomotive
bore down upon him.'
Before time could scarcely mark a pause
it became too late for coaxing. Another
moment would have seen the little toddler
ground beneath the Iron wheel?. Suddenly
the little sister rushed forward and
grasped the bewildered baby in her arms.
A slightest pause, an instant of suspense,
would have meant death to both the chil
dren. There was no falling in the little
heroine. With every muscle strained to
the breaking point, she carried her heavy
burden to the other side of the track
Just as the engine rushed past.
She fell Just beyond the reach of the
wheels, her brother safely clasped in her
arms. Some of the cocks on the engine
struck and bruised her and the air of the
onrushing locomotive caused her a heavy
fall. From these Injuries she will be con
fined to her bed for several days, but her
brother escaped entirely without injury.
The morning and the evening trains of
the new system are well patronized, but
the half-hourly trains through the day
are never filled. This is .so because the
line, depends entirely upon transient
travel. When commutation tickets are
sold after the first of the month there will
probably be a difference in the amount of
trailic.
Passengers say that the 5:30ifast train
was fast enough, but that the one put on
to-night exceeds it. After leaving Six
teenth-street station the engineer opens
the. throttle so wide that the train simply
leaps over he rails. Some women on to
night's train were frightened at the rock
ing and swaying of the cars.
The fast train reduces the time ten min
utes, which is about ten minutes slower
than the new system. It reaches Lorin,
the first stopping place, at the half hour
and then fifteen minutes are consumed In
stopping at the stations between â¢ Lorin
and Berkeley, making forty-five minutes
for . the trip. The new system does the
trick in thirty-five minutes.
To meet the cut in time between .Berke
ley and San Francisco made by the new
ferry line the Southern Pacific Company
put on a second flyer to-day on its local
system. The company has been meeting
the. 5:30. o'clock boat for several months
with a fast train, but now the inroads
on its -traffic by the competing line have
forced If to put on a train to meet the 6
o'clock boat.

Bâ â EKELEY, Nov. 11.â Whether the
football eleven wins next Satur
day or no the "students of the
...-University of California are going
to have some fun ;at Stanford's
expense. If the eleven wins the satire in
drama at the Alhambra Theater on the
evening of the game will smart according
to the depth of the score, but If It losesâ
well, the fellows will laugh anyway.
The drama to be exhibited la a farce
called "Under Protest." It was written
by A. C. Keane andJo Loeb. It deals
with the aftermath. oÂ£ a .football game
between the elevens of two Chinese uni
versitiesâYu See and Pal Lo (Alto).. The
Pai Lo eleven, wearing a* lobster on the*
breast as an emblem, instead of an S,
protests that it lost the game because
there was a co-ed ori the Yu See .team.
The emperor sends his soldiers to ap
prehend the maiden, who has disappeared.
She is captured and the condition 'for her
release is that she shall tie up the Pal
Lo eleven, which she does. The. upsHot
of the whole thing Is that Pal Lo forces
Yu See to promise to play at least four
co-eds in each game, so that Pal Lo may
win once in a while. The, cast of char
acters is as. follows:

employed at Idora Park. He. lives in San
Francisco, and came over bright and
early this morning and at the license
counter gave his age as 38 years and that
of his Intended as 19. He also made an
engagement to meet Justice of the Peace
Geary at the noon hour with the girl of
his choice! When he returned it was to
call the engagement off. He did not ask
for his money back, but said he had a li
cense he did not want that any one could
buy cheap.
Le Lievre got his license to marry Miss
Ella Wright, who lives at 1007 Jackson
street. It transpired that she did not
know until the day of the wedding that
Le Lievre was a motorman, and when
she found It out she began to cry and
decided that she could not consent to be
come the bride of a car man. The guests
had assembled before Le Lievre was in
formed of the bride's change of mind.
As the eatables had been prepared he
proposed that the guests be entertained,
and while the wedding did not occur the
breakfast was served. Tho bride has gone
to San Francisco.
Last Saturday William Le LJevre bought
a permit to marry Ella Wright, and the
cerembny was to have been performed
that evening, but the couple are still un
married.
Alexander Williams purchased one of
these licenses this morning for the pur
pose of marrying Gertrude Pelcher, and
two hours later returned' and said that
the engagement made with the Justice
had been called off 'and there would be
no wedding.
Two marriage licenses were reported to
the County Clerk to-day as having failed
of their purpose, the reason being that
the intended brides had changed their
minds when the hours for the ceremonies
arrived.

Policeman Wallace related that on the
night of the party he was awakened by
the racket and went next door to request
that it cease. After his sister had re
ferred to Mrs. Tilden as a "snip" the door
was flammed in his face, and he caused
a warrant to be issued some* days later.
Wallace says that he would not have
urged the arrest had It not been for the
fact that the Tildens seemed to have in
vented new devices for creating noise in
the days that followed. He said that a
hammer wag, used by his - neighbors for
pounding on the walls. As a reason for
this opinion he said that Tilden was a
carpet-layer and thoroughly conversant
with the use of the hammer. He said the
charges In the Police Court were not dis
missed at his suggestion, but at the earn
est request of the defendant. The com
mission at this point found that the po
liceman was Justified in causing the war
rant to be issued, and dismissed the
charges against him.
Miss Annie Henneberry, who is em
ployed by the telephone company, told of
"noises beyond description" that kept
everybody in the house awake. She re
ferred to the Tilden house party as a
party of "wild Indians" and said she was
Rlad when the neighbors packed their
trunks and left. "From the evening of
the party until October 15, when they
moved," said the witness, "the noise in
creased. Every day something was add
ed to its intensity, and these people had
some iron instrument that traveled from
room to room, battering on the walls." F.
Golden, who Is employed in the cashier's
department at the Union Iron Works,
had paid the officer a brief visit on one
occasion and had heard the turmoil next
door.
Attorney. Walter Gallagher opened the.
defense with a statement that the charges
brought by Wallace were dismissed on
the pleading of Tilden. Chief Bond and
Warrant Clerk -Fltxpatrick testified that
he had sent notice of the complaint to the
Tilden home, but," with the exception of
a telephone message, no attention was
paid to it. Miss Theresa Johnson, who oc
c.ipies a room in the Wallace house, de
scribed the disturbances in the Tilden
house as being caused by the slamming
of doors, moving of things on the floor,
battering of objects against the walls and
running up and down stairs. She said
the Tilden party on October 3 was a noisy
affair and that she was compelled to leave
her room until after midnight, when it
broke up.
t PARTY OF INDIANS.
George S. Tilden, cashier for Baldwin
& Howell and a brother of the complain
ing witness, tes tilled to having been pres
ent at the house party and to the of
ficer's visit Then Miss Edith Tilden took
the stand. She said that whenever she
attempted to play the piano these "so
called people," as she termed her neigh
bors, would hammer on the walls, slide
furniture across, floors and roll the "can
non ball" up and down stairs. A. Roth
child, who visited the Tilden home on one
occasion, said that be heard the "cannon
ball" in operation and that the 'racket
made him Jump.
CANNON BALL ON STAIRS.
It required two hours' time and 200
pages of stenographer's notes for the Po
lice Commission to ascertain last night
whether Baron 6. Tilden, a carpet layer,
and his relatives, residing at 1525 Bush
street, or Police Officer .Thomas A- Wal
lace and his relatives, residing at 1523
Busn street, created the greater disturb
ance In that neighborhood. Tilden al
leged that the officer should carry the
banner in this respect, but the Commis
sioners accorded that distinction to the
tack driver and the charges made against
the policeman were dismissed. If the*
voluminous testimony is to be believed,
such things as "cannon balls." "iron in
struments that travel from room to room,
banging on the walla"; "coal boxes that
are used as targets." noises "beyond de
scription" and "wild Indians" played im
portant parts in the rackets.
The proceedings were ludicrous from the
beginning. Tilden, acting aB his own at
torney, livened things up and testified
that the trouble began vhtn Wallaces
sister objected to a little Spit* dog that
his sister had brought on the premises.
He further stated that the policeman had
nailed a large elecion banner, extolling
the merits of one "Webster." across the
front of his house and would not take it
down for several days. On the evening
of October 3. when he was having a lit
tle party In the kitchen, Wallace came to
the door and threatened the members of
his family with arrest if they did not
cease their noise. Mrs. Tilden was pres
ent when the threat was made and Miss
Wallace Is said to have shouted from her
door to her brother: "You're lowering
yourself to talk to that dirty, little
snip." Tilden said that noises as If a
cannon ball was being rolled up and
down etairs came from the Wallace resi
dence, also thumping on the walls and
pounds as of the marching of cavalry.
Finally, Tilden says, he was obliged to
move to 1407 Van Ness avenue. He was
then arrested on a complaint of having
disturbed the peace, sworn to by the po
liceman, and claims that he suffered hu
miliation by being placed in a cell for tfn
minutes.

Marchant went there armed with a

when refused an entrance he demolished
the rear door, but the young woman
escaped the front way and was taken to

her escape It Is alleged that he* threatened
to kill her brothers. Then they appealed
to the police. Meantime he made a- vic
ious attack upon the two boys. "When
his wife learned that he was to be ar

his mind.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. U.-Because of
his infatuation for his sister-in-law and
as a result of his efforts to find her here,
even to the extent of breaking down
doors and threatening murder. Dr. Grant
Marchant. a wealthy physician of Mlll
edgevllle. Ohio. Is a fugitive from justice.
He left the city to-day when ho learned
that the police held a warrant for his ar
rest. The charge Is that of disturbing
the peace, but a more serious charge
probably will bÂ« lodged against him.
Miss Violet Chltty. aged 22. is the sister
in-law, and she is now in the Convent of
the Immaculate Heart hiding from him.
She came here two weeks ago to escape
him. After her departure Marchant. it
Is said, forced his wife at the point of a
revolver to tell him where her slater had
gone and then sold his property and fol
lowed her here, bringing his wife with
him. He could not find his sister-in-law,
but his wife says he beat her until she
had to tell him that her sister and two
younger brothers were living oi South

DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
"I have no more
nervous headaches
and rest very well at
night."
When a woman snffers from female
weakness and irregularity or other forms
of womanly disease, the effect is cer-
tain to be marked in her nervous sys-
tem, the general effect being, as in Mrs.
Woodin's case, " nervous headaches, rest-
lessness at night " and a run-down condi-
tion. .It. is simply common sense then
which says if you cure the female weak-
cess, irregularity, etc., you will cure the
nervousness, sleeplessness and other con-
sequences of womanly disease.
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription cures
the womanly diseases which undermine
the general health. It establishes regu-
larity, dries enfeebling drains, heals in-
flammation and ulceration, and cure3
female weakness.' It cures headache,
nervousness, sleeplessness, etc., by cur-
ing the womanly diseases which cause
these ailments.
Sick women are invited to consult Dr.
Pierce, by letter, free. All correspond-
ence strictly private. Address Dr. R. V.
Pierce, Buffalo, N. Y.

C. J. Dickman has three impressive
canvases entitled "Dawn," "Twilight and
Moonrise," in which a subtle blending
of color conveys the meaning better than
any word can describe the varying
H. W. Seawell has a masterpiece in "A
Lonely Fireside." It represents a peasant
woman sitting beside a wide, Flemish
hearth, with the interior furnishings and
architecture worked out delightfully in
the shadow. Only ' the light from the
hearth and the window apparently give
the lines. Another beautiful thing of his
is "In the Old Chateau Grounds." Among
his other meritorious offerings are "Vil
lage Street." "Old Stone Bridge. Nor
mandy," "Venetian Landmark," "In Ven
ice," "Venice by Night," and "A Bit of
Chinatown."
LINES IN SHADOW.
L. Maynard Dlxon has two desert
scenes in oil that are. strikingly realistic
in conception and execution. For the in
terest in- the theme, "Without Water"
will probably attract more general atten
tion, although "The Mohave" Is the abler
of the two. The first depicts a desert
traveler plodding along, leading his horse,
in the shadows of an approaching sand
storm. The coloring Is entirely in dull
grays and blacks and excellently handled.
The desert scene In the other picture, In
similar colors, conveys to the full the
idea of utter dreariness and desolation.
Other exhibits of his in t>il are: "April
Showers," "Bay Tree" and "Valleclto." In
water colors he has an exquisite bit,
called "Red Canyon." It represents an
Indian gazing up at the walls of one of
those | canyons whose coloring can be
found only' on the desert and It is so true
and impressive as to attract at once the
gaze of the looker. HIb other water colors
are: "Road In Monterey," "Round Oaks,"
"Pueblo Indian" and "Mounted Navajo."
John M. Gamble's most striking oil Is
"Golden Poppies." It represents a stretch
of poppies widening up toward the top of
a bill and Is fairly overflowing with the
rich coloring of the beautiful flower. The
composition is carefully worked out and
the canvas is one of the most striking of
the exhibition. His "Evening on the
Marsh" is another composition that, at
tracts much attention. He has some de
lightful water colors In the flower line,
the best being "Near Lake Merced," de
picting a field of daisies running far out
to the water's edge. Among his offerings
in oil are "Twilight," "A Summer Night,"
"Washington's Monument," "Morning
Fog," "The Rising Moon," and In water
colors "Spring Flowers," "In Violet.
Green and Gold," "A Rocky Knoll."
"Morning on the Lagoon, Venice." "Alta
dena Poppy Fields," and "The Hay
Wharf," the latter especially deserving of
mention.
his is "Chinatown, Monterey," which ex
hibits wonderful fidelity In coloring and
drawing. Other exhibits of his are: "On
Point Pinos." "Near the Ocean" and
'"Foggy Weather." ; ;
TWO DESERT SCENES.
One of the features of the exhibt are
the beautiful rugs used for decoration,
which were loaned by Bengulat, the Ori
ental importer.
Among the many other exhibitors whose
work shows merit and warrants mention
are Lucia K. Mathews, who. has pre
sented "Waiting, MontereyV' "Gera
niums," "Child at Play," and "Summer
at Monterey." C. D. Robinson offers
"Morning In Jack Hays Canyon," "In
Monterey Bay," "Sunset from the Oak
land Shore," "Autumn Afternoon," "The
Stone House," "On the Rio Grande," and
"Nightfall." M. Fancher Pettls exhibits
"Redwood" (oil), and "Soquel Creek"
(water color). Elmer Watchel offers
"Mountain Tops," "Winter Evening,"
"Midwinter In Southern California."
"Pines at Gualala." "Santa Barbara
Coast" and "Lagoon at Gualala." G. A.
P. Plazzoni offers "La Vista." "Winter,

"Blossoms"; "Afternoon, Catallna Isl

tumn, Carmel Valley."
Harry Stuart Fonda exhibits "The Na
tivity." "The Pool," "The Decline of
Day," "The Rising Moon" (marine), "A
Gray Day," "A Woodland Nook," and
"Fishing Boats, Chloggia." His "Ris
ing Moon" is the best marine of the
exhibit, but while splendid in compo
sition, seems to lack lateral breadth
and coloring. J. W. Clawson has
loaned two excellent portraits for
the exhibition. C. P. Neilson has on ex
hibition "Mission Dolores, San Francisco
(1S33)"; "In Corridor, San Juan Mission":
"Kitchen, San Juan Mission"; "In China

The steam schooner Ruth was driven
ashore last night Just south of Ffsher
nian's Bay. At last reports the Ill-fated
vessel was hard and fast on the rocks
and no attempt had been made to save
Â¦her. Her crew was still on board, an
ticipating the probability of her being
floated when assistance should be sent
them. She was partly loaded with rafl
road' ties -Intended for this port, and
through some unknown cause she was
forced ashore. Early this morning tugs
will be sent from here to her assistance,
and If thÂ» . weather keeps mild chance j
are good for her belns pulled off from
her perilous position. The vessel is owned
by George D. Gray & Co. and was being
loaded by Bender Bros, of 5 Market
street.
The steam schooner Acme, which sailed
from San Francisco for this port about a
week ago with the schooner C A. Klose
in tow, arrived this afternoon without her
tow. While coming up the coast the
Acme encountered very severe weather
and her hawser parted several times. The
last time was early last evening when
off Tillamook Bay. The schooner made
sail and hove to and the Acme stood by
until, this morning, when the storm had
Increased to a gale and and was driving
the schooner toward the shore. As it was
impossible to work the Klose off shore.
Captain Doran reports that shortly be
fore 8 o'clock yesterday morning he sight
ed a collier bound south with a steam
schooner In tow about twenty miles off
Trinidad Head. While he was fully five
miles from the collier and her tow and
could not identify either vessel. Captain
Doran says the latter answers the de
scription of the Charles Nelson even to
having a . yellow smokestack, but her
deck was above water and her hull ap
peared to be Intact. The vessels sighted
by Captain Doran are undoubtedly those
seen Monday by Captain Taylor of- the
Rosecrans.

And to do this "means much; to desire
to do It means to be an artist with a
streak, at least, of the great stuff In him.
It is precisely In the poetic charm of Mr.
McComas' earlier ' workâ or. let 'me say
rather, in the general recognition of itâ
that I foresaw an element of danger to
the artist, and looked forward with some
what of apprehension to his 'future. The
power to charm, the almost certainty of
a great popular success, can come too
early. It requires firmness of character
and great integrity of purpose to resist
the temptation to work the vein that
yields money and applause galore and
keep one's eyes well beyond mere imme
diate success and one's striving always
and only for the best that is to be got
out of oneselfâ malgre the . chance of a
temporary lessening of the public favor.
To be able to do this is to have courage;
it seems to me that Mr.- McComas is
showing just that kind of courage, and in
this little exhibition we are seeing the
fine fruits of it. The breadth and dignity
of his golden-toned Moncrey Bay, as well
as the noble and simple lines of such a
composition as Doud's Canyon, attest
high endeavor and, already, high achieve
ment, while the charm and poetry of
some of the lesser poems is as exquisite
as you will find It in the songs without
words of Mendelssohn or the preludes of
Chopin.
M.r. McComas is reaching out for other
qualities as well, and shows some cy
presses of rugged strength and a well
nigh dramatic tendency, not to. my mind
as entirely successful as some of his oth
er work, but still full of a fine perception
of at least one phase of his subject. It
is In his purely lyrical episodes that Mr.
McComas Is still at his best; the bigger
side of things he is reaching for, slowly,
steadily, but with just the right kind of
persistence: And it is bound to come to
him. v-v-V ; '*: / -;
a soft neutral gray which serve as
an admirable background for the twenty
odd landscapes of Francis McComas that
are at present to be seen there, a series
of canvases noteworthy as an evidence
of the progress that Mr. McComas is
steadily making in the technique of his
art, as well as toward that fuller, higher
expression of himself which is (or should
be) the end and aim of all striving after
technique.
To those who remember Mr. McComas'
last exhibition it will be patent at once
that the last year has been one of hard
study andâ as a reward for faithful work
âgenuine growth. The pictures are not
larger than those of other years; they are
not more striking; perhaps, on the whole,
they are even slightly less so than what
he has heretofore exhibited. The gain is
in depth and subtlety of expression, in
purity and, above all, certainty, in-line,
and in positive charm of color, which
Mr. McComas is learning to make as
sweet as music without the least suspi
cion of a sacrifice of truth or concession
to* mere prettiness.

WASHINGTON, Nov. ll.-In a bill in
troduced In the Senate to-day by Senator
Mitchell of Oregon the Government is
asked to appropriate J2.125.000 to aid in
the celebration of the exploration of the
Oregon country by Captains Merrlweath
er. Lewis and William Clark. The Lewis
and Clark Exposition will be held in Port
land, Ore., commencing May 1, 1905, and
ending November 1, 1&05, or beginning, a
month later and closing a month earlier
if the date should be so designated by
the legislative assembly of Oregon.
Senator Mitchell said in reference to the
bill that the exposition would receive the
support of the State of Oregon through
the appropriation of $500,000 and a con
tribution by the citizens of Oregon of
$400,000. The author of the bill gave no
tice of his Intention to make a few re
marks in connection with the measure
before it was- referred to the Committee

trapedy cf December last was brought
to light by tne receipt of an anonymous
threatening letter by Dr. L. Lewis of WI1
hur. a brother of Judge Lewis and his
aped wife, who were murdered at their
home near Almlra. The letter was mailed
at Wilbur and reads:

Tbe letter is written on common paper
in a difcuised hand and there is no sig
r.ature. The epistle was mailed a few
days ago # but the officers have tried to
keep the matter secret. Many anony
mous letters have been received by per
s-ons connected with the Investigation of
the Lewis and Thennls murders. AH are
threatening and Indicate the existence of
a desperate gang in the wild country of
Western Lincoln, Douglas and Okanogan
counties. The man in jail referred to in
the last letter Is Cyrus Victor, who is
now on trial for the killing of Charles
Thecnis last April. It is believed that
Thennis was murdered because he had
1'oasted that he could lay his hands upon
the murderers of the Lewis couple. A
masked man entered a saloon conducted
by Th^nnis and shot him without any
apparent motive. Thennls died without
giving the name of his assailant.
The Lewises were an aged couple living
a few miles from Almira. Their bodies,
horribly mangled, were found one morn-
U-,g In December last by neighbors who
broke Into the house after noticing that
it had remained shut three days. Evi
dences of robbery were on all sides, the
murderers having ransacked every room
in the house, even taking up the carpets
In the search for money which Judge
Lewis was known to keep in his house.
No direct clew has ever been obtained
to this mystery, though the anonymous
letter and murder of Thennls seem to
bear out the statement of j the officers
that an organized gang of desperadees has
its headquarters in Central Washington

Eastern' capitalists have expressed a desire to buy our

to sell is an advantage to the buyer, not the seller.
A notable feature of the present eco
nomical situation in the industrial world
is the migration of industries from one
country to others, In order to neutralize
protective- tariffs or antagonistic labor
movements, and the starting of facto
ries outside of the zone covered by the
hostile tariff. Thus many English firms
have recently opened branch factories in
the United States, and from Germany
comes the news that representatives ' of
several great German chemical Industries
are negotiating with the Russian authori
ties to obtain permission to establish
works in Russia. Of course, this move

selves much mental concern to /determine whether a Chi

subject by the testimony of, say, Schwab or Carnegie. ;: No
one will deny that they are merchants and a shrewd suspi

Just $100 In cash and this went for a yoke

It Is well to have this fund, small ! or
large, entirely disconnected from the busi
ness of the husbandâ a epecial Â¦ eavlsfs
Church and charity expenditures are
not Included here, since these are and
ought to be considered strictly personal
matters. Then a definite amount, agreed
upon between the two, should be laid
aside as a general contingency fund
cither for accumulated pavings, if this
is possible, or at least to meet especial
emergenciesâ such as fire, sickness or
death.
Certain expenditures, easily determined,
should be charted to family expense.
This charge will cover rent, taxes, fuel,
light?, water, sen-ice. *food, household
equipment, fire and life and accident in
surance, clothing, etc., for. children as
long as these are a charge upon the fam
ily, amounts paid for books and maga
zines and the daily press, and recreation
and traveling expenses in which both par
ticipate.
The best plan advanced for determining
these relations is for each party to make
a plain, systematic business statement of
his or her entire concerns at the close of
each month.
There may come a time when both may
be able to command the services of ex
pert assistants who will relieve them of
the personal care of details and give them
leisure for recreation or more congenial
undertakings; but until that time comes
each must be faithful to his or her trust.
A wife who for any reason treats her
bounden duty in a left-handed manner,
neglects It or postpones till to-morrow
what should be done to-day, or sets It
aside that she may do that which is
more enjoyable, is simply disloyal to her
husband and family; precisely ,as he
would be disloyal if he were guilty of
similar action in regard to his calling.
But where the wife is conscientious and
lnyal prantlng her fitness to be married

not. Fhe oucht to beâ and she will not
become so by continually refusing to give
her the opportunity for this.
Wherever they seem to fall below the
male standard In these matters it Is sure
ly because they have not been given ex

It is the duty of the man to render such
service In his part of the professional or
commercial world as will secure a return
adequate for the maintenance of a fam
ily. It is the duty of the woman to care
for the expenditure and general adminis
tration necessary to the maintenance of
th* home.
Each ought to advise with the other,
and *ach will advise freely where the re
lations are at all mutual or what they
ought to be; but neither will intrude upon
the fleld of the oth*>r. The administration
of the home oupht to be, and under nor
mal conditions is, the first care and re
ceives the best thought of the woman. A
wife may no more properly neglect this
duty, nor make it subsidiary to her own
pleasure or personal comfort, than a hus

BY treaties recently established between the republic of
Paraguay and the Governments of Germany and
France, through bills of lading are now granted upon
all merchandise shipped from Asuncion to ports of either of
the European powers. Instead of having to procure one
bill of lading at Paraguay's capital city for the shipment
of merchandise down the La Plata, and a second one upon
transhipment to Buenos Ayres, the German and French
exporter now has only to turn over his goods to the
river steamship company at Asuncion, receiving therefor
ajhrough bill of lading to Europe. By the freedom from
anxiety and the insurance against delay consequent upon
this new Â¦ commercial arrangement the trade interests of
Germany and France in the great La Plata Valley are in
creased twofold.
This is but another step in the march of commercial
supremacy in South America exerted by England, France,
and especially Germany. In Brazil five of the largest gold
mines are worked by English syndicates and one by a
French company, the united capital of the six being $6,700,
000. British capitalists own most of the great refrigerating
plants for meat preservation in Argentina. Through its nu
merous colonies in Brazil and Argentina, by the influence
of its commerce and the power of its bankers, Germany is
practically conquering the two largest South American re
publics. While it obeys the letter of the law in the eyes
of diplomacy, William's empire is subverting the Monroe
doctrine by the growing power of trade.
In the commercial enterprises of the eastern coast of
the southern continent more particularly the United States
cuts no figure at all. One American Consul writing from
a port of Colombia sends up the despairing cry that there
is not a merchant from his land in the district. Of the ex
ports from Argentina in the year 1901 $28,920,759 went to
Great Britain, $28,637,121' to France, $21479,882 to Ger
many and only $9,296,454 to the United States. In the
same year the British exports into Brazil amounted to
$5,921,745; the imports from the United States were only
$2,347,075 for the same year.
Much has been said during the last year of the com
mercial invasion of Europe by the United States. Our
merchants have , fought Germany over their meat and > fruit,
and bickered with other European powers over the endless
question of tariff. Meanwhile the great continent below us,
which we have sworn to protect from European armed in
vasion, is falling before the assaults of European trade.
SOUTH AMERICAN COMMERCE.
The many varieties of cells may be di
vided into four classes-epithelial cells,
connective tissue cells, muscle cells and
nerve cells. These will be discussed in
the next article.
There are several methods by which
cells multiply or reproduce themselves.
These processes are not as yet perfectly
understood. Enough, however, is known
to show that the act of reproduction is a
very complex operation.
The process of cell reproduction Is thus
found to be fundamental to all continu
ance of life and constitutes one of the
most beautiful and interesting phenomena
of nature.
The study of the activities and struc
ture of the cells Is beset by many tech
nical difficulties. Among those may bo
mentioned the microscopic size of j the
cell, its extreme delicacy, its translucence.
rendering artificial staining necessary and
the difficulty, often the impossibility, of
keeping it alive under the changed con
ditions of the microscope slide. In spite
of the difficulties, however, enough is
known to establish the belief that eome
if not all of the cells are themselves com
plex bodies composed of numbers of
smaller bodies and provided with a tubu
lar pystem In which is a circulating fluid.
Another fact which seems firmly estab
lished Is that the cells after reaching a
certain degree of differentiation form no
new varieties, but simply go on reproduc
4ng, "each alter, its kind," continuing this
process until the cells bo reproduced are
of an Inferior quality. This deterioration
of any body of cells, that is, of an organ,
results In Joes of health and ultimately in
death for the entire organism.
In the first place we find that all the
cells of the body, widely different as they
are in form, structure and function, have
come from one original cellâ the ovum.
The splitting up. or segmentation as it
is called, of the ovum leads to the for
mation of the embryonic or "indifferent"
cells, and these "indifferent" cells divide
and subdivide, becoming ever more and
more highly differentiated, until, In the
adult bodv. wi find a number and va
riety of cells passing comprehensionâ cells
ranging from those of tooth or bone struc
ture, the duty of. which Is merely to stay
In place and resist pressure, to the pha
gocytes, or devouring cells of the blood,
which are actually the guardians of the
body and which exercise in the perform
ance of their duties a certain degree of
what must be regarded as volition and
intelligent choice.
(Editor Health Culture Magazine. New York;
author of "Fool Values of Meat." "Com
mon Disorder*," etc.)
As stated in a preceding article, the hu
man body, instead of being, as It appears,
a solid homogeneous structure, is a mass
of cells, in number beyond computation,
and each organ is a body of cells which
has its special duty. When it is said,
however, that each cell is a separate.
Independent and, in many cases, appar
ently intelligent individual, the statement
may seem incredible. That this may be
understood we will consider a few facts
concerning the cell as an individual. .

Some of our local police officers, noticeably those that
have been most frequently in trouble/are agitating a scheme
to ; force every person making complaints against them to
file a bond as a pledge that he will prove hi3 charges. Such
a plan of protection is obviously unwise. The worthy offi

who think the world revolves around their clubs, should not
be armed with it as a menace to legitimate inquiry of their

Tale of a Kitty.
Taxing the Host.
According to a titled European observ
er of affairs of the day. a royal visit by
one of the crowned heads call3 for an
exchange of financial courtesies which are
rather disastrous to the nation which has
the fortune to play the host.
"There are no shrewder business people
in the world than the Italians, the Lom
bards, Indeed, being the originators of the
modern system of banking." says this
keen observer. "No surprise will, there
fore, be caused by the fact that the Ital
ians are about to take a remarkably
clever advantage of the excellent Impres
sion created throughout Europe by the
recent visit to Paris of King Victor Em
manuel and his beautiful consortâ an im
pression which is likely to be rendered
still more agreeable by the cordial wel
come which the excellent 'Papa Loubet,'
as the French President is known every
where, is certain to receive a few weeks
hence at Rome. The advantage In ques
tion is nothing more nor less than the
conversion of the Italian debt from S to
3 per cent interest. Nearly JSOO.000.000 of
the Italian debt Is held in France, and
the result +>t this conversion 0$ Italian
bonds from 5 to 3 per cent will constitute
a severe blow to the Incomes of the petty
bourgeolse of France, by whom the Ital
ian Government stocks are largely held.
The preparations for this conversion are
already under way. Of course, the Ital-*
ian treasury authorities do not dream of
admitting that there is any connection
between the transactions and the visit
to Paris of the King and Queen of Italy;
but the popularity which the latter have
acquired In France, more especially In
the gay metropolis, has been turned to
good account by those who are arranging
for the conversion of the debt. For they
have managed to create such a boom in
Italian Government stocks as to bring
their price up to 105. and It is on this
groundâ that is, the exaggerated value of
the bonds â that they are to be converted
into 3 per cents."
T American Hospitality.
In commenting on the reception of the
Honourable Artillery Company in Boston
and New York, the London Globe says:
"The gastronomic perils which the mem
bers of the Honourable Artillery Com
pany have found In America afford but
one more instance of tha splendid hospi
tality which America offers to her vli
Itors from this side. A writer in a weekly
paper was discussing this some time ago,
and comparing it with the hospitality
which we sxercised toward visitors from
the States. He came to the conclusion
that in this respect. If no other, we have
much to learn from America. Nobody
who has not crossed the Atlantic can ful
ly realize the boundless hospitality of tlie
American. The reports of it which find
their way Into the papers deal only with
the manner In which celebrities have been
received, and it is not as regards these
that the hospitality Is so remarkable, for
every country likes to welcome people of
importance. It is when the private indi
vidual goes across that he has the op
portunity of judging. One letter of in
troduction will carry him through a city

will make It their business to Introduce

enjoys himself. The normal condition of
the average Briton in such cases Is one
of haunting fear lest he may be saddled
with a bore, end be unable to get rid of
him. "We might take courage and profit
by the example of our cousins of New

AS far as the investigation by the State Board of Trade
has gone it is demonstrated that the deciduous fruit
growers of California have nothing to say about the
cost of boxes, transportation, commission or final price to
the consumer. They pay interest, and taxes, the cost of
plowing; pruning, thinning, picking and packing their
product, and then their property goes into the hands of
the middleman, who charges a commission, which they pay,
but do not fix, and who makes to them such return as he
pleases.
' No other farm crop is marketed that way. The open
price, honestly returned, in Mark Lane fixes the price of
wheat to the producer. The Mark Lane price, determined
by supply, and demand, influenced entirely by what the con
sumer can pay and by the volume of the supply, goes back
to the producer, less Insurance, transportation and cost of
handling. So it is with all the great staple farm crops of the
country. The natural law that fixes price works for the
benefit of the producer.
A farmer should be in training, as he is in faqt an in
ternational merchant. The wheat-grower in California is
affected by the yield in India. If the monsoon come upon
the Indian field in its season, he knows that a full crop will
meet his in the world's market. If the monsoon fail, and
drought or the fly appear in the wheat fields of the Black
Sea country, he knows that the world's bread corn is short.
In either case he gets the proper price for his own crop, in
fluenced by supply and demand. So it is with cotton, to
bacco, rice, sugar and all of the great staples of the world.
Though fruit is a more perishable property, the difficulties
of its transportation to a distant market have been so far
overcome that the green fruit of California is steadily mar
keted in London in prime condition and in competition with
the green fruits 6f Southern Europe. The shippers who
attend to their own business get a larger profit out of that
far market than others, who have nothing to ' say about
'their fruit after it leaves the packing-house, get out of the
domestic market, only half as distant.
. An investigation of the price paid by the consumer shows
a wide discrepancy between that and the returns made to
the producer. This must, in the nature of things, mean that
the consumer .is paying too much or that the. producer is
cheated. If the price paid by- the consumer for California
fruit were subject to the same law and regulation as the
price of wheat, when the consumer pays fifty cents per
pound, the producer would receive fifty cents per pound,
less freight, refrigeration and commission. We desire to
make this plain, in order that the fruit-grower may be put
in the way of establishing the same method and the same
means for securing the natural and proper price for his prop
erty as the grower of other staple crops.
The producer takes all the risk. He stands exposed to
all the risk of wind and weather, of deluge and drought.
The insects and fungi attack him. He stands at the initial
point, the origin of the business. He it*is who goes with
naked hands to the conquest from nature of a valuable
article of commerce." necessary to the welfare of others, re
quired for their health and nurture. When the raisin
grower of Fresno fights phylloxera and thrips, red spiders
and grasshoppers, and meets frost with smudge, and stacks
and unstacks his trays as it rains or shines in the drying
season, and gets six cents a pound for his finished prod
uct, and the consumer only,- 200 miles away pays for it
twelve cents a pound, it is evidence that one hundred per
cent has been absorbed somewhere, somehow and by some
body between the producer and the consumer. Extend this
condition to the whole fruit crop of this State, green, dry
and canned, and it is believed that in the process of dis
tribution, after the product leaves the grower, there is an
equal average absorption of one hundred per cent, which
the consumer pays and none of which reaches the producer,
who has taken all the risk to create the supply.
How this is done, by whom, and at what stage of the
passage from producer to consumer, is what the State Board
of Trade is determined to find out. ' If the fact is established,
then a remedy may be applied. The middleman, the com
mission man, takes no risk at all, at least none that is so
far apparent. If the fruit do not sell; for enough to pay
the freight, he exacts it from the producer just the same
and also takes hisT commission out of whatever price the
fruit brings* He is apparently the master of the situation.
The grower makes the investment, produces the property,
pays all the cost of getting it to the consumer, stands the
loss in transit and has nothing to say!
The investment in fruit plantations in this State is enor
mous. It runs far into tens of millions. It is increasing,
since it is proved by the absorptive capacity of the market
that overproduction seems impossible. "New land in the
foothills is yearly cleared for new citrus and deciduous or
chards. The olive and fig follow the' lead of deciduous and
citrus planting. For every tree and vine put in the ground
a new consumer appears .within ..'transportation- reach.
Wheat fields are turned. into. orchards and. vineyards. This
i3 the greatest fruit-growing country in the world in area,
in possible variety, in stability and certainty of supply. If
a proper return from the consumer in all markets that
we reach come back to the producer, we have in fruit
growing the most interesting, attractive and profitable in
dustry related to the soil that the world has seen. Let
all the facts about the market and the profit and the pro
ducer's rightful share be threshed out, by upholding the
State Board of Trade in its comprehensive inquiry.
Making such modifications in this gen
eral scheme as may be necessary or seem
desirable, in Individual cases, it will be
found entirely feasible.
Its result will surely be lessened fric
tion, a more correct appreciation on the
part of each of the difficulties which each
must encounter in the care of his or her
part of these matters of mutual interest,
and with clearer understanding tlrere will
always come leas misunderstandingâ a
consummation moat devoutly to be
wished.
To this may be added a small "interest"
in the "business," from which the child
will clothe himself or provide for mis
cellaneous personal expenditures or even
begin a savings account. "Where there is
more than one child each may be so

Interest, say from the age of 15 to 18.

be trained in these business habits, be
cause they will scarcely get them else

good training after they reach the busi

The division having been made, each
may again advise the other, if advice is
sought, as to deposit or Investment or use,
but neither should offer unsought ad
vice. Each should be made to feel that
that which has been received through
this division is absolutely personal prop
erty for his or her own unquestioned use.
Children may be brought into this
"partnership" and may be . taught busi
ness habits by making them serve as ac
countants for this "firm" (after they are
old enough to do such work) and by let
ting them know all the details of this
"business."
It has been said frequently that this is
entirely impracticable in the case of an
extensive business, and nothing is lost
by admitting that there may be cases to
which this general rule does not apply.
But with far the vast majority of la
borers, wage-earners, salaried men and
men conducting ordinary business in the
ordinary way, this scheme Is entirely
feasible and practical. It has stood the
test of years of practice In more than
one family.
These matters being cared for, that
which remains of receipts or profits ought
to be systematically and regularly . di
vided between the two. In the case of a
man with a ealary, this division may very
properly be half to each, since the man
has no special demands upon his purse
for maintaining his position.
In the case of a business man, this di
vision may perhaps bÂ« two-thirds to the
husband and one-third to the wifeâ since
there are some necessary personal ex
penses which a man must meet in con
nection with bit business.
It will be better, however, to charge
this against the business (or, in case of a
salary, against family expense) before the
division is made.
It will be understood that in case of a
business man that which is shared from
month to month, after the payment of ex
penses, is such part of the net profit of
his business as may be safely withdrawn.
Profits or earnings which must remain
in the business, of course, cannot be
shared in this way. If the question be
asked as to what shall be done in case
there is no profit, but an actual loss â

enough to meet her share of this loss pre

THE DOMINICAN BRAWL.
rpHE Panama situation may be studied not only in the
I light of the past brawls on the isthmus, and of the
A revolutions, so called, in Salvador, Honduras, Guate
mala, Nicaragua and Venezuela, but by the glare of the
present proceedings in San Domingo.
-The United States is pledged to support the Monroe
doctrine by every consideration of national honor and
safety. The risk we take in doing so is yearly made greater
by. the vicious disorders in Latin- America. Brawling and
theft, of . which European nationals were the victims, fol
lowed by the bad faith of Venezuela in disregarding her in
ternational obligations to Europe, put upon us the great
strain incident to the concerted blockade of the ports of
that country. The diplomatic world has been kept in a
ferment by the issues of that act, which barbaric disregard
of decency made necessary. Now San Domingo, not yet
recovered from the revolution of last ; year, and not yet
having paid for the theft or. destruction of the property of
American and other^ nationals, is at it again. ,
A band of thieves representing the "outs" is after the
band of thieves representing the "ins" with fire and sword,
torch and guns, hammer and tongs. Both bands of thieves
on land have in partnership crews of pirates with armed
ships on the sea. Both bands are proclaiming blockade,
and American ships are fired upon, and German ships are
threatened, .turned back and prevented from landing their
cargoes. The commerce of all nations is interfered with,
those who carry it on are endangered, and there is roar
and uproar throughout the Caribbean Sea.' Right across
the Mona Passage our flag flies over Porto Rico. Jamaica
is near by. Civilization is handy to San Domingo, but its
influence does not penetrate the impervious skulls of the
people of that little autocratic flea among nations. Ger
many has to send a warship there to protect her subjects
and their property. It may be fired upon by some of the
fool pirates who are chasing the merchant ships of other
nations. In a moment the most serious complications, in
volving the Monroe doctrine with the rights of Europe, may
arise.
On the isthmus our treaty of 1846 makes us the police
man to protect the' rights of the world to peaceful transit
of that narrow strip. The Monroe doctrine makes us the
policeman of the Western Hemisphere. As such it may
become our duty to take these San Domingan thieves by
their ample ears and sit them down with a jolt that will
break fcheir teeth.
It is time an example were made with some of these
brawlers. They may any day involve us in a war with
Europe, or, in what is worse, a surrender of our hegemony
of the hemisphere. If civic principles and human rights
were being advanced by these revolutions, as they were
advanced by the revolutions of 1643, 1688 and 1776, it would
be our duty to keep hands off and hope for the victory of
principles. But there is no principle at stake in any of them.
They are simply plundering raids to attain power and
use it for oppression. They deserve no more respect than
a train Tobbery in Montana or Missouri.
"One hot day the mules were tugging
through this here sandy stretch that
borders the 'devil's tract,' when I noticed
an odd little bundle a mile or so off in the
waste. Being a little ahead of time, I
drove across the hot sand in the direction
of the bundle, more out of curiosity than
anything else. I thought some prospec
tor had cached some of his provisions out
there and covered them with a canvas.
When I got nearer I see a dog sitting by
the pile and a way off to the west a
couple of burros were picking up what
little bunch grass they could find. As I
approached the dog gave a snarl. I could
see t that under the canvas was the form
of 'a human being. I succeeded in con
rinclng the dog that I was all right and
pulled back the canvas. It was an awful
sight that greeted my eyes. An old man
was lying there dead, by his side an emp
ty canteen. A lump rose in my throat as
I dug a shallow hole with a piece of
board. Then I got out my beat horse
blanket and carefully wrapped the poor
devil in it and slid his corpse into the
hole, my every movement being greeted
with a snarl from the faithfui dog.
"As I finished I heard a low howl and
turned to see three coyotes steadily
watching me from a little knoll not far
off. Every time I tried to get the dog to
leave the spot he would only growl, so I
drove off, thinking maybe he might fol
low. As I looked back I could see his
dark form outlined against the white
background, sitting there in that terrible
waste of sand. I didn't pass again for a
week and looked for the dog, but he was
gone. I drove over again and found what
was Jef t of the poor critter lying mangled
and torn by his master's grave. A few
meatless bones told the tale. How long
the dog had lived or what a terrible fight
he had against thirst and in trying to
keep the coyotes from the grave, God
only knows."
It was along a dusty ride and the stage
driver was telling a story. "You see that
vast stretch of alkali land over yonder.
"Well, a few years ago that place used to
be the coyotes' delight. I guess there's
been a score of men perished there in the
last five years. "Whenever one of the boys
happened " to have to cross the 'devil
tract,' as they uster call it, and ran across
a few bones scattered over a. square rod
of ground they'd push 'em together, dig
a little hole and shove 'em in without so
much as a prayer for the poor devil who
uster own 'em. -TV;

AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
6John McMullen, representing the Atlan
tic, Gulf and Pacific Company,' which had
made the lowest bid for doing the work,
was present and made a strong appeal in
the Interests of his company..
The Commissioners, however, relied
upon the original estimate of Engineer
Lott D. Norton, who placed the -cost of
construction at $100,000, as against the bid
of McMullen's company of $111,100, and
decided that from the figures in their pos
session, based to some extent on the price
that the Santa Fe Railroad Company was
paying for work of a similar character^
they could not in Justice to themselves
and to the city's welfare award the con
tract on the terms offered.
Mayor Schmitz arrived after the meet-
Ing was concluded. However, In deference
to his ex-offlcio position on the commis
sion the matter was again opened up and
informally discussed. The Mayor was of
the opinion that the contract should have
been awarded to McMulIen'B company.
The difference of $11,000 over and above
the engineer's estimate, and even added
Interest and sundry small costs, appeared
to him to be a minor detail in ,the matter.
Commissioner Klrkpatrlck was, however,
of an entirely different opinion. He did
not Intern? for a single instant to allow
the city's money to be wasted, he said.
The work under discussion is the con
struction of 600 feet of seawall. In the
near future about 4500 feet more will in
all probability be constructed, and the
price of construction of this latter will be
based upon the King street wall, which
Is the subject now at issue.
Commissioners Spear, Klrkpatrlck and
Mackenzie were present, and each took a
lively interest In the subject In question.
The pros and cons of the case were fully
discussed.
The Seawall Commission at the regu
lar meeting yesterday decided that it
would reject all bids for the construction
of the King street seawall and would
advertise for new offers. '
Suspicion points strongly to the woman
with the muff, who is said to be a
wealthy society dame. The person who
stole, the articles ladt year is undoubtedly
the same that got the silverware on Tues
day. The management does not feel Jus
tified in notifying the police authorities,
but a watch will be kept on the display
room for the woman supposed to be the
thief. -
Shortly after the latter three left the
room the young women in charge noticed
that five costly butter knives had disap
peared from one of the tables. Then
they made a hasty examination and to
their surprise discovered that five hand
some teaspoons and a pair of knlvea and
forks were also missing from two of the
other tables.
The young ladles who were in charge of
the room on Tuesday say that Just before
the noon hour a handsomely gowned
woman, wearing a large muff, came Into
the room and began to examine the things
on the tables. She seemed much interest
ed in the high art china and glass and
asked many questions.
The woman had been In the room sev
eral minutes when an elderly woman and
two younger ladies entered and began to
examine the articles. The first woman
then left tho place and soon thereafter
the other three took their departure.
The room is In charge of two saleswom
en whose duties are to look out for the
articles and show them to prospective
buyers. The room Is carefully watched
by the two young women, so It would be
Impossible for any one but a clever sneak
thief to take any of the articles on the
tables. ' -' / Â¦
The theft occurred in what Is known as
the Thanksgiving display room. This
apartment Is situated in the center of the
store and each year, shortly before
Thanksgiving, crockery^ glassware and
cutlery of the value of several thousand
dollars are on display on several large
tables.
The crockery and glassware establish
ment of the v Nathan-Dohrmann Company
on Sutter street received a visit {rom a
sneak thief shortly before noon on
Tuesday, and handsome cutlery to the
value of $20 was taken. The manage
ment of the concern is of the opinion that
the daring thief is no, other than a well
known society woman. A peculiar phase
of the case is that last year a similar
amount of the same pattern of cutlery
was stolen and the se'eond theft makes
the set complete.' -

Contracts were awarded to Flinn &

Property owners protested against the
proposed reduction in ths width of the
sidewalks on Clement street, but action
was postponed until November 25, when
the proposed bltuminizlng of Clement
street will be acted upon.
City Engineer Grunsky reported that
the cost of bltuminizlng Dupont street;
between California and Sacramento, and
Pacific street and Broadway would be
$3950. The Board of Supervisors will be
asked for authority to expend the amount
for the purpose.
Commissioner Schmitz was delegated to
Investigate t the encroachment of a show
window on the sidewalk on Geary and
Powell streets, which was constructed
without a permit. It being the decision of
the board that tho window should be
moved back.
The board expressed itself as opposed
to the proposed construction of a spur
track on Filbert street, from East to
Sansome, to connect with the Santa Fe
tracks, as the spur would take up al
most the entire width of the street by
pursuing a zigzag course. The City En
gineer was directed to modify the plans.
At the request of a property owner the
board decided to construct the sidewalks
on Third street with angular corners.
The property owner agreed to construct
new sidewalks in front of his property
and will endeavor to induce others to do
the same.

BOASD OF WOBKS ACCEPTS
BELATED DAMAGE CLAIM
General Stone was chairman of the,Re
publican State Committee throughout the
Presidential campaign of 1900. When the
message was conveyed to party leaders
in the East that California gave 40,000 plu
rality for William McKinley many.con
gratulations to Stone were flashed over
the wires. Senator Mark Hanna expressed
special delight over the management of
the campaign In this State.
During the past week General Stone has
exchanged views on the political situation
with representative worklngmen of the
State and is fairly familiar with politi
cal conditions on this coast. Informa
tion derived from press dispatches and
private telegrams causes the Impression
here that Senator Hanna will again man
age the national campaign on behalf of
the Republican party.
The Republican National Committee will
probably meet in December to designate
the city in which the convention shall
be held and to fix the time for delegales
to assemble. Early action In this respect
is desirable in order that the city win
ning the convention honors may have
ample time to arrange for extension of
the customary facilities.
There are no indications that San Fran
cisco will enter into the competition for
the honor of entertaining the Republican
National Convention of 1904, as the great
Triennial Conclave of Knights Templar
will be held here next summer. During
the present year the public I spirited citi
zens of San Francisco contributed in gen
erous fashion for the reception of the
President and for the entertainment of
the National Encampment of the Grand
Army of the Republic. Later on, perhaps
in 190S, San Francisco may resolve to
enter the field In competition with East
ern cltlefl for the national convention
prize.
General George Stone will leave San
Francisco for Washington, D: C, thia
evening. It is Quite well understood In
the Republican camp that he will confer
with Senator Hanna and other leaders
of the party before he returns to the city.
There is no foundation for the conjecture
that the Postmastershlp of San Francisco
has anything to do with his expedition to
the national capital. He goes to "Wash
ington in response to telegrams from men
high in the councils of the Republican
party.
The case of Feld. charged with murder,
was called in Judge Fritz's court yeFter
cay morr.ing, but was, by consent, contin
ued till Saturday.
Police Sergeant Blank, who arrived at
the house shortly after the shooting, tes
tified that Feld had denied having fired
the shot that killed Dirking.
The dying statement of the decedent
was read to the Jury. In It Mr. Dirking
stated that Joseph Feld, his son-in-law,
had shot him.
"?â¢'â¬Â» the undersigned Jurymen, find that
Fritz Dirking came to hla death on No
rambtt 3 through a gunsnot wound ln-
Cicted by Joseph. Feld. end we charge
said Jcseph Feld wlta the crime of mur
der." ".V;
guc'.i was the verdict rendered yester
cay by a Coroner's Jury, after hearing
witceesea recite how Policeman Joseph
Feld had shot down hiÂ» father-in-law.
Fritz Dirking, on his own threshold, at
II Fair avenue, on November 2.
v/hile the widow of the murderÂ«d man
was on the stand telling how Feld came
to the house and beat her and her hus-
Land -with an iron Jimmy before firing
u. bullet into the old man's breast, Fe.'d
emiled sarcastically. The smile faded
away but once, and that was when the
widow, while leaving the Btand. bent upon
h:sn a look of such burning reproach that
his eyelids dropped.
Feld's wife left him last September and
!;led suit for divorce, Feld In the mean
time paying alimony by order of court.
Mrs. Dirking, the widow, testified that
h( r daughter had been forced to separate
frcm Feld because of his brutal treat
ment, he having threatened very often
to take her life. Fearful that he might
carry his threats into execution, she and
irer daughter consulted a lawyer, and he
advised thtm not to admit Feld to the
house. A little after 6 o'clock on the
evening; cf November 2 Mrs. Feld went
to the telephone in answer to a call and
recognized the voice cf her husband. She
hung up the receiver without answering,
but the bell continued to ring. At a quar
ter to 7 o'clock Feld came to the back
door acd tried to pry It open with the
Jimmy. The witness and Mrs. Feld ran
toward the front of the house, screaming
"Murder! help! police!" He then went
around to the front door and while the
eged -witness had her knee acalnst the
door Feld struck her on the knee with
the Jimmy ar.d struck her husband on the
head with the same weapon. Almost im
mediately afterward Feld fired and shot
her husband, then turned and ran toward
California avenue # with the wounded man
In pursuit. At the time Dirking was shot
he had no weapon.
Fritz Dirkir.c Jr.. a son cf the mur
dered man, about 16 years of age. cor
roborated the testimony of his mother
concerning Feld's attempt to break into
the house. After Feld had shot the old
man the boy ran into his mother's room
and grot a cheap revolver out of a drawer
end snapped it at Feld,' but the hammer
failed to explode the cartridge. The wit
ness admitted that after the fatal shot
was f.red he gave his father a carving
knife to defend himself with, and that
as his father chased Feld the prisoner
eaid. "I've got something Quicker than
a knife."
Irwin's attorney held that as Irwln had
been accused of malfeasance in office the
charges should be sworn to, but the com
mittee ruled it would not be necessary.
Brandenstein said the committe would
make a thorough investigation of Irwin's
administration outside of the charges
made by the society, to which the attor
ney objected.
"This Inquiry will be conducted with a
view to determining whether Irwin shall
be retained," said Brandensteln. "We can
remove him without a trial if we desire.
Irwin's own testimony shows that he has
not conducted the pound properly."
Action on the society's charges was
postponed until next Thursday at 2 p. m.,
when witnesses will be examined and Ir
wln heard In his own defense.
. Chairman Brandensteln stated that in
asmuch as the charge was made by the
eociety that there was a defalcation In
Irwin's accounts, in that he had failed to
make proper returns of fees collected by
him, it would be necessary to expert his
books.
The Supervisors' joint Committee on
Finance, Judiciary and Police yesterday
directed tho Hassell Audit Company to
expert tho books and accounts of Mayor
Schmitz's poundmaster, H. O. Irwln,
against whom charges have been filed by
the Pacific Humane Society, which also
petitioned that the management of the
pound be placed In its hands.

are stated in detail In the application to

In Canole he will meet a different style
of fighter and the contest should be more
Interesting. Britt's fight with Seiger was
advertised as being for the lightweight
championship. As neither Britt nor. any
other boxer has been able up' to the pres
ent time to smoke out Joe Gans, the rec
ognized champion, the claims of Tues
day night's fight promoters carry no
weight. Bmwli/SMy^rTPi^S^P!@SB^^B
This is not likely, as he seemed-ln-per
fect condition. He is naturally slow on
bis feet,- in this respect^ being in marked
contrast to Martin Canole, who is quick
and graceful in Â¦ his movements ' even" in
ordinary attire. * . I /-Â¦'Â¦
. Britt and Canole meet one week from
to-morrow night at.Colma. There . is
much work to be done . on, the new pa
vilion before a fight can . be held there. ,
There was a wide . difference of opinion
yesterday as ; to ' Britt's showing against
Seiger. Some, thought he performed bril
liantly, while others felt he lacked, the
dash ', and freshness which characterized
his earlier efforts In* the His * face
seemed drawn and haggard and he had
a serious cast of countenance, showing
the complete absence of bis former, buoy
ancy. On one point- the majority of ;the
spectators' agreed. . That was .that Britt
did not have the power to knock Seiger
out. He hit him repeatedly In .vulnerable
spots,-; but the stopping power ; waa- not
in the blows. . .
"Who ever told you that you could box
like Corbett? Why didn't you get in and
fight Britt Instead of trying to be clever?"
This is Manager Billy Roche's end of
a colloquy held with Seiger yesterday
when they were discussing the
night's fight. 1 .
It represent* the point of view of the
spectators as well as that of Roche.
Seiger, who played the part of the al
most; human punching bag, could; only
say he was disappointed, at; his
and believed he had been In Â¦ tralnlng : too
long.

Rain Prevents Baseball Games.
There was no baseball game In this city
yesterday on account of the rain. The
game at Sacramento was called at the
end of the 'second Inning for the same
reason. /
Hall was wild In the second and third
innings and allowed six hits. After this
he steadied down and pitched in his best
form. Both teams hit the ball hard, but
the locals were lucky in placing theirs
where the fielders could not get them.
Francis for Portland and Ross for Los
Angeles were the particular stars, both
making remarkable catches of line hits
that appeared to be Impossible chances.

eleven, will be the head linesman and

The varsity eleven did not indulge in its
last line-up practice game against the
second eleven, as intended, this afternoon.
Coach Whipple decided the grounds were
too wet for that, so the men only went
through signal practice. The two days
now remaining before the game will be
devoted simply to signal practice, kicking
and running with the ball. â¢
It looks now as if it would rain Satur
day, which means, of course, a slow, slip
pery, muddy game.. The grounds at Rich,
mond will not put the players to the same
advantage as the Berkeley grounds did
last Saturday, however. The Richmond
ground is sandy and will not stick to the
feet, as the Berkeley mud has a habit of
doing. Coach Whipple thinks the chances
of the teams will not be changed whether
it rains or not. '
"The men on both sides are so evenly
matched in weight," he Bald to-night,
"that a wet ground will be of no advan
tage to either team. I prefer that it
should be dry, however, as then the men
play a better game.
"I have definitely decided to put Stern
In first as fullback. His work last Satur
day against Nevada convinced me that
hÂ« Is the man for the place. Forse will
be reserved for tackle in case we need a
man for that position.
"As to Hudson, there will be nothing
decided until just before the game on Sat
urday. It all depends on how he feels
then. If he thinks his leg will stand the
rough-and-tumble he will go in. Then he
can play as long as he stays unhurt."
Mr. Reid, the principal epeaker.'gave an
address on "The Trials of a Coach and the
Spirit of Competition," using many In
stances observed while he was coach at
Harvard to Illustrate the points of his
remarks. He urged the students to sup
port and not to criticize, the coaches of
Ihelr teams taylng the latter had enough
to worry them without being troubled
with hasty and unnecessary criticisms of
their methods. Mr. Reid also advocated
pure athletics and denounced the practice
of trying to "rattle" players In varsity
baseball games and similar unsportsman
like co r.G'jct.

STANFORD .UNIVERSITY. Nov. 11.-
Thls morning's general assembly was de
voted to the discussion of matters con
nected with athletics. W. T. Reid Jr. of
Harvard and Dr. Frank Angell, chairman
of the faculty athletic committee, ad
dressed the meeting, which was presided
over by President Jordan. As but two
days intervene before the day of the big
same the enthusiasm displayed by the
rooters at this morning's assembly sur
passed all previous exhibitions of college
spirit as exemplified by \igorous cheering.
Dr. Angell spoke of the changes in
athletic conditions recommended by the
Stanford and California faculty commit
tees, particularly with reference to play-
Ing future intercollegiate football games
on the campus gridirons and as to the
proposition of having- the rival freshmen
teams determine the Intercollegiate cham
pionship by a series of games to be played
in February of each year, and also that
the freshmen of the two colleges have
contests on the track and diamond. The
speakers heartily indorsed the recommen
dations cf the two committees, particu
larly the desire /or campus games, which
he declared could be made a thorough
success from every standpoint.
Prominent Speakers Address General
Assembly at Stanford University.
DISCUSS ATHXETICS
The threatening weather conditions are
worrying the Stanford supporters at
present. A light team must depend on
cpeed If it Is to win a fotball game, and
should Richmond field be heavy on Satur
day it would .probably prove detrimental
to Stanford's chances of scoring. The
cardinal team, despite the confident asser
tion In one of the morning papers to the
contrary. Is considerably lighter than that
of their opponents. The weights of the
Berkeley center trio are heavier than the
writer announced, according to the state
ments of the players themselves. A cas
ual glance at the two elevens will show
there Is a greater difference than one
pound to the man In the aggregate weight
of the two elevens.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 11.â
The last secret practice of/ the football
sea* on occurred on the gridiron this after
noon. The coaches put their men through
two hours of strenuous work. The men
appeared on the field at 4 o'clock Instead
Â«f a half hour later as has been the prac
tice heretofore.
While the varsity and second teams
lined up for a half-hour's hard scrimmage
work the larger part of the time was de
voted to signal practice and punting and
goal kicking. The team does not appear
as thoroughly familiar with their signals
as It should be. and this defect the
coaches are attempting to remedy by
continued practice at running through the
different formations.

;* Â«THE5 PAIN KINO, W
Those who have ever felt its keen, cuttingpains; or witnessed the intense
suffering of others, know that Rheumatism is torture, and that it is right-
ly called "The Kingof, Pain." ' '
â¢. All do not suffer alike. Some are suddenly seized with the most excrucia-
ting pains, and it seems every muscle and joint in the body was being torn
asunder. Others feel only occasional slight pains for weeks or months, when >
a sudden change in the weather or exposure to damp, chilly winds or night
air brings on a fierce attack, lasting for days perhaps, arid leaving the pa-
tient with a weakened constitution or crippled and deformed for all time. "..! .

CHICAGO, Nov. 1Lâ A general strike
of the 3000 employes of tho Chicago City
B-ailway was decided upon to-night at a
mass-meeting of the men. They will quit
work at 4 o'clock to-morrow morning.
This decision was reached after a con

weeks between the representatives of the
union and the management of the rail
way. Numerous conferences have been
held In an effort to adjust the difficulty
by arbitration, but without satisfactory
results, and the decision to-night to strike
to-morrow morning was unanimously In
dorsed by the men. The demands of the
union were for an advance in wages of
23 per cent, recognition of the union and
several other minor concessions.
The company, it Is said, has several
hundred men in readiness to take the
places of the strikers and will endeavor
to run the cars with non-union men.

Sudden Death, of Mrs. Edith Palmer.
SAN RAFAEL. Nov. 11.â Mrs. Edith
Palmer, wife of Charles Palmer, & banker
of New York City, died suddenly at the
Hotel Litchenburg here this morning.
Mrs. Palmer had been sojourning in Cali
fornia for several months and had been
in San Rafael the larger portion of the
time. The deceased was 25 years old and
a daughter of Colonel William Blrk
helmer.
.When near the corner one of -his ppra
panions shotted" to "him to 'beware, and
upon turning he saw ' Migalo advancing
toward him with a large knife in 'his
hand, he says. Believing his life was In'
danger, Nicolo alleges, he drew his re
volver and fired one shot, then turned and
ran to his home, throwing the gun away
In his flight.
The statement of Nicolo Crudo was
taken down and will be used at the trial.
According to the police they are in posses
sion of evidence that will prove conclu
sively to a Jury that the deed was pre
meditated, and the plea of self-defense
will not hold. Their star witness, whose
name they withhold on the ground that
his life might be placed in jeopardy if
given publicity, is believed to be Joe Da
manti, one of the trio present at the
shooting. It Is claimed that his testi
mony will be that the two Crudos and
himself waited at the corner of Green and
Kearny streets for Migalo, and as he
came up Joseph Crudo spoke to him. Joe
and Migalo then began fighting, and Mi
galo was struck In the face. Nicolo Crudo
then came up and shot him with a re
volver. Nicolo then turned and ran down
Kearny street to Vallejo and then to Du
pont. Joe remained for a moment and
then took to his heels.
LITTLE CREDENCE IN STORY.
Lorenz Wederroth, who resides at 1217&
Kearny street, will also be an important
witness for the prosecution. He was lying
in bed on Sunday night and was unable
to sleep. He heard some men talking and
then a shot. He threw open the window
and saw two men running away and two
pick up a prostrate form, carry it to the
curb and then walk away.
Joe Wolf of 1218 Kearny Btreet was
across the street from the shooting, but
owing to the darkness was unable to rec
ognize any of the participants in the
crime. He walked over to the dead man
and then went in search of an officer.
The police have ascertained that the
trouble between Migalo and Crudo arose
over Migalo's loss of a bootblack stand at
Eddy and Taylor streets last August.
The Board of Works ordered him to move
his stand from the sidewalk and he ar
ranged with the proprietor of the grocery
to pay $15 per month rental and the ex
pense of remodeling the side of the build
ing In which to place the stand. Crudo
approached the bartender in the place,
and, it is claimed, offered him 5200 and
the proprietor $25 -a month if he could
have the place. He secured the place and
Migalo was put out of business.
The police place no credence In Crudo's
story of self-defense and he will be
booked on a charge , of murder. They
point to the fact that there was no knife
found near the body of Migalo as disput
ing Crudo's statement that he feared his
life was in danger, from a knife thrust at
the hands of Migalo. Crudo is about 50
years of age and of small stature. All of
the principals in the tragedy are natives
of Calabria and it is feared that more
bloodshed may result from the murder.
After being In jail six hours Crudo sig
nified his desire to make a confession and
was accordingly taken before Captain
Martin at 10 o'clock last night. Through
Interpreter Martini he made a statement
of the affair, in which he admitted having
fired the shot that caused the death of
Migalo, but declared that he did It In
self-defense. His story of the tragedy Is
to the effect that he met Migalo In a sa
loon on Dupont street shortly before the
killing and they became engaged in a
wordy war over Crudo's action in ousting
Migalo from a bootblack stand at the cor
ner of Eddy arid Taylor streets. No
blows were struck, and in company with
Joseph Crudo and Joe Damanti Nicolo
walked up to Green street and down to
Kearny.
Nicolo Crudo has confessed to the po
lice that it was he < who fired tho shot
that brought death to Prosporo Â¦ Mlgalo,
bootblack, at the corner of Kearny and
Green . streets last Sunday night. This
Clears up the mystery of the killing, as
far as the actual murder; is concerned,
but the police have yet a search to make
for evidence on which to convict Crudo.
Nicolo Crudo, who was taken into cus
tody yesterday, is an uncle of Joseph
Crudo, who was arrested In connection
with the killing and charged with mur
der. The police have been actively scour-
Ing the Italian quarter for Nicolo, but it
was not until yesterday that information
was received that he was in hiding and
intended to leave the city as soon as an
opportunity presented itself. In the after
noon several officers from' the detective
bureau surrounded , a house opposite
Crudo's home at 22. Lafayette place and
upon effecting an entrance found the man
for whom they had v been searching, sit
ting by the fire, contentedly smoking a
pipe. He was manacled, taken to the
Hall of Justice and put through a" severe
examination. To all questions, however,
he declared at first that the murdered
man was 1 his friend and that he had not
seen him at all on the night in question.
He further stated that he had gone home
at 10:30 p. ' m. and knew nothing of the
shooting until the following morning,
when some of his relatives apprised him
of the affair.

tim of the third rail on the North Shore
Railroad is Captain William N. Shelley.
Captain Shelley was killed about 6 o'clock

and was killed.
SALT LAKE, Nov. 11.â The coal miners
of this State have been granted an in
crease of 10 per cent In their wages. Spe
cials from the different camps show that
the advance has been general, the rate
of pay being raised from $2 50 to $2 75 a
day.
Hundreds of miners have already drawn
their savings from the banks at Trinidad
and gone away to seek employment else
where.
Colorado Fuel and Iron Company of
ficials claim to have more men working
in the southern field than on Monday,
but the number of miners on Btrike in
that region Is conservatively estimated at
7000. With 1S00 additional idle miners In
Fremont County and about 2000 in the
northern field, the total number of strik
ers in this State exceeds 10,000.
James Kennedy, member of the national
executive council of the United Mine
Workers of America said to-day that
transportation for 4000 miners from the
Trinidad district to Iowa -had been ar
ranged for and that unless a settlement
with the operators were reached 6oon
2000 men would be sent from Colorado to
Missouri and Illinois and 1600 to Texas.
DENVER, Colo., Nov. 11.â Reports from
all coal camps where miners are on strike
are to the effect that good order is still
maintained. The Trinidad union's 4iead
quarters has received a request from
Texas coal districts for 500 men and Okla
homa has asked for 150. These probably
will be sent at once.
PUEBLO, Colo., Nov. .11.â Independent
coal mines are -one by one. making terms
with the strikers and this will have an In
fluence with tho two principal operating
corporations. A special -.. to â¢ the Star-
Journal from Trinidad says that at a con
ference between representatives of -the-
Coal Miners' Union of District No. 15 and
the management of the San Juan .Coal
Company of Aguilar, the coal company
agreed to every demand except the 20 per
cent advance. A compromise was finally
effected at 10 per cent. President Howells
asked if the San Juan Company would
consent to a conference with the small
operators. This was granted and a con
ference was held and an agreement made
which. It is believed, will settle the strike
so far as they are concerned.
TRINIDAD. Colo., Nov. 11.â It Is re
ported here late to-night that negotiations
are pending between the Colorado Fuel
and Iron Company and the Victor Fuel
Company and the operators in the district
whereby a settlement of the difficulties
may be reached before the end of the
week. It is stated also that miners to the
number of 175 were shipped into Denver
to-night bound for this point to take the
places of the strikers and that they will
arrive to-morrow.

gency appropriation of $25,000 for the pure
food section work. Laboratories for test
ing food products entering the country
are to be established at New York, Bos
ton and New Orleans, and the one at San

mostly from Italy and" France, will cease
to be shipped ..here in adulterated form
and that imported wines will be sent here
in better form. .It Is understood that the
commission on pure food will recommend
to Secretary Wilson that white wines
Â¦containing not over twenty mlligrams of
sulphurous acid, per 100 cubic centigrams
of wine be made the standard. -

Fliooting, together with Jim McKlnney
and & third man unknown to her. She
contradicted her testimony given' at the
inquest on several points at the prelim
inary examination, and subsequently In a
rew?paper Interview declared that she
had perjured herself and that Hulse was
not present at the shooting and that Mc-
Kinney was the only one who shot. She
had -declared several times to officers at
the jail that she will so testify when on
The stand.
oner's inquest and preliminary hearing
swore that he was In the josshouse at the
HAaL'I^FIELD. Nov. II.â The twelfth
Jur^r In the Hulse case was chosen this
afternom at 5 o'clock Just before court
adjourned. At the request of counsel for
the defense the jurors were committed to
the care of the Sheriff to be held until
after the cise is determined. Of the
twelve chosen nine are farmers from the
surrounding country and three are resi
dents of Kern City. Of the last three
one is a prominent merchant, another a
machinist and the third a prominent
eheepman. All residents of this city who
wfre drawn on the panel were excused,
nearly all for bias against the defendant.
The taking of testimony will begin to
morrow morning. Interest is centered
largely on the probable testimony of Jen

SANTA CRUZ, Nov. 11.â Rain began
falling this morning and continued stead
ily all day. It was the heaviest of the
season.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 11.â A 6torm
which forcibly presaged the coming of
winter .struck this city last night with
unusual severity. The wind gauge at the
Weather Bureau recorded a velocity of
thirty-four miles an hour at an early
hour this morning and at several points
nearer the coast the wind attained a ve
locity of fifty miles an hour. In this city
the wind was accompanied by torrential
rains and some damage was done. The
most serious effect of the storm was the
razing of a six-room cottage, in course
of construction Jn North Portland. Signs Â¦
and awnings were blown down, but no
casualties resulted. It is believed that
shipping interests suffered but little, ow
ing to the timely warnings sent out by
the Weather Bureau to shipping points
along the coast, but reports of disaster
on the high Eeas may yet be received.
It is believed that the crest of the storm
has passed.
SPOKANE, Wash., Nov. 11.â A storm
of snow and rain, which seems to center
off the strait of Juan da Fuca, is cover
ing Oregon, Washington and British Co

er office gives warning that high winds
may be expected.
SACRAMENTO, Nov. 11.â News from
Northern California to-day is to the ef
fect that a light rain is falling all over

of the Central Pacific road, but there
has not been a fall of snow thus far this
season. A light rain fell In this city to
day.
GRASS VALLEY, Nov. 11.â Rain worth
thousands of dollars is now falling In this
country. It is a veritable godsend to the
farmers and cattlemen, as the long dry
spell had caused a great lack of feed on
the ranges. Hay has been selling at fancy
prices, large quantities being imported
from the State of Nevada and the valley
counties of this State. The present storm
bids fair to continue for some time.
SANTA ROSA, Nov. 11.â Rain which be
gan falling about midnight Tuesday has
kept up all day. The ground is becom
ing pretty thoroughly soaked and when
the rain ceases will be in splendid con
dition . for plowing. Tho rain was gen
eral throughout the county, and even far
ther north. The streams In this vicin
ity have been dry for some time past,
but from this time on will contain plenty
of water. The grass on the hills Is spring-
Ing up nicely from previous rains and
Eome grain is beginning to sprout. The
rainfall to date this season is considerably
behind last year.

vada, "Wyoming:. Utah and Western Colo
rado were pwept by a storm to-day that
has resulted In an almost total prostra
tion of telegraph service over that ter
ritory and In the mountains has all but
tied up the railroads in a regular mid
winter blockade. The storm, which is/s till
raging with unabated fury t is the severest
on the coast. For live days rain has been
falling without cessation in the Puget
Sound country, which turned into snow
to-day, accompanied by wind, which to
night is blowing at {he rate of thirty-five
miles an hour. Heavy gales are reported
along the Pacific Coast in California, ac
companied by torrential rains. So far no
marine dhqffcters have been reported. In
the gorges of the Cascade Mountains
snow fell to a depth of four feet on the
level and is still falling and railroad traf
fic la eeriously impeded in consequence.
At Helena and Butte and over the ranges
of Central and Eastern Montana the rain
storm has turned into a blinding blizzard,
with eight Inches of 6now at Helena, six
Inches at Butte. with a high wind and
rapidly dropping temperature. South
ward, in Wyoming, Nevada and Utah,
there has been little precipitation so far,
but high winds have prevailed for nearly
twenty-four hours. Telegraph service has
been practically wiped out. Prostrated
telegraph poles and wires burieel in snow
drifts resulted in the Pacific Northwest
being- almost completely cut oft from the
outside world for the greater part of the
day, while conditions were almost as bad
In California.

Unless the school child has food that
nourishes brain and nerves as well as
muscles the child â¢will not develop as it
Ehould.
Brain wastes away daily Just IlkÂ© the
rest of the bo<5y and must be rebuilt and
th<s / only way to do this Is by the proper
food selected for Just this purpose.
: A schoolgirl cf Worcester, Mass., wrote
en interesting article about her experi-
ments with food to study on: "Two years
epo I had Indigestion so bad that food
did not nourish mÂ« and I lost a great deal
cf flesh and ctrcngth and was always
Buffering from trouble in my stomach.
I could not study, for my head always
seemed clogged up.
"One day at school I noticed that one
of the girls had a box cf Grape-Nuts. I
. "ackhd her ebout it and from what she
. told :r.e made up my mind to try the
food.
. "As the result, of eating Grape-Nuts
three times a day in place of Improperly
â¢elected food I have at last found the
way to permanently cure my indigestion.
â¢Grape-Ni:!s food Is light, delicious and
digests vithout trouble, the heavy feel-
ing in rr.y stomach is gone and I have
been gaining flesh rapidly ever since I
made the change to Grape-Nuts. .
"Not only is the Improvement physical,
but 1 feel so much better and clearer In
ray head and I have more ambition than
I have ever known before. I used to feel
po faggrd cut in my brain and stupid
and had headaches, but that Is all gone
end now I feel like a new person.
"I am absolutely certain that Grape-
â¢i.'uts helps me get my lessons, because
now I can sit for hours and study and
. accomplish a great deal, while when I
was living on thÂ« old diet I would simply
thrre and accomplish nothing.
F-, To tÂ»>n tho truth. Grape-NutB, as I tell
BJJ my friend*, worked a miracle in my

The Curacao's Cargo.
The steamer American, which was cleared

this port S1.060 cs canned salmon, consigned
to New York, and 5175 cs for Philadelphia.
Canned Salmon for the East.
The steamer Santa Monica, bound from
Grays Harbcr for San Pedro, put In here
yesterday to land passengers. She sight
ed the Nelson in tow of a collier at 2
p. m. last Monday, thirty miles south of
Cape Blanco. The Nelson was entirely
submerged astern and the collier was
making slow progress with her tow.
Investigation into the abandonment of
the steamer Charles Nelson was begun
yesterday morning by United States Local
Inspectors Bolles and Bulger. Captain
Thomas Gundcrson told a straightfor
ward story and the other officers testified
to a similar state of facts. The steamer
was abandoned at eea on Friday morn
ing, November 6, about fifteen cr twenty
THE collier that has hold of the
! waterlogged derelict Charles >Tel-
Eon is havine a hard tussle and
is making slow progress with her
prize. Everything points to its
being the Edith Captcin Hall, and if it
is the Charles Nelson will probably be
brought to port. Hail is one of the ablest
navigators on the coast and is a thorough
seaman. His steamer is stout and able
and if the job can be done Hall will do it.
The steam schooner Lakme is probably
by this time in the vicinity of the Xel
son, as is also the tus Defiance. The
Lakme has great power for a steam
schooner and the Defiance is one of the
most powerful tugs on the coast. Be
tween the three vessels, the Nelson should
be saved.
miles off Umpqua. At the time of the
abandonment the ship was almost full of
water. All the crew, twenty-flve in num
ber, and the nine passengers were taken
off in the two lifeboats.
The captnin stated that when the vessel
was being abandoned there was no disor
der or accident. Two days before the
abandonment a fierce gale sprang up and
strained the vessel, causing her to list to
port. She began to leak so badly that
steam was ehut off from the engines and
utilized for the pumps to keep the ship
afloat. While in this condition the port
lifeboat was washed overboard and two
of the sailors volunteered to go after it
with the liferaft. They rescued the boat
and brought it to the lee of the steamer.
By orders of the captain, who kept
cool during the whole time, all the
crew and the passengers put on life pre
servers and took to the boats. After
floating for twenty-four hours they were
picked up by the tug Sea Rover, which
transferred them to the steamer Tltania.
They were landed in San Francisco last
Monday.
The inspectors have taken the case un
der advisement.

had a miraculous escape- from death.
Miss Ammerman, who was with her fath
er and mother, escaped without injury.
The party had been touring in a new
gasoline autocar and were returning from
Pasadena by what is known as the adobe
road. As they neared the city limits a
team was met and in attempting to give
the horses plenty of room Ammerman
steered the automobile too close to the
edge of the roadway. The machine
plunged down a ten-foot embankment and
turned over.
Ammerman was thrown out and severe
ly cut and bruised. His wife was pitched j
headlong against a fence and seriously
injured. Although Miss Ammerman was
pinned down under the heavy car; when Â¦
she was extricated it was found that she
had not been hurt. The car was running

acquittal this morning after having been
out all night. The lawyers for the de
fendant sprang a surprise yesterday by
submitting the case -without argument.
Hiram Johnson of San Francisco and F.
II. Farrar of Merced assisted District At
torney Hoar in the prosecution. The de
fense was conducted by F. G. Ostrander
of Fresno, G. G. Goucher of Madera and
W. M. Gibson of San Francisco.
Ingalsbe shot Henry Cowell last March
and was acquitted on a charge of assault
to murder on the ground of insanity.
Cowell's death followed in August and
now his assailant is acquitted of the mur
der charge. The defense in the murder
triaJ claimed that Cowell's death did not!
result from the bullet wound.
The trial lasted a month and cost the
county more than $10,000.

ers anticipating heavy receipts and lower
prices to-day. Teal. Widgeon and Mallard

Provisions.
"Railroed earnings continue satisfactory,
roth grots and net. although decreases in the
latter grow more frequent. Railroad managers.
however, are often making strenuous efforts
at retrenchment, not only In improvements, but
eJso la ordinary operating expenses. Whether
thl* Is due to increased cwj of labor and
materials cr to fin anticipated decline In busi
ness does cot yet aspear. But tfce movement
1Â» clrn^ccant sr.d is probably partly owing to
both causes. Bank clearings for several weeks
bave been showing declines of 15 to 20 per
cer.t compared with last year, the heaviest
shrinkage, cf course, being ia the Eastern
fir.tEC.al centers, while the Western cities ftill
continue to ehow gains over last year. A con
een atl\-e - policy eo*mÂ» penrral in business cir
cle*. The sharp <Seclir.es in Iron products at -
tract attention, ar.d at first exert a deterrent
effect. EvestnaTIy. however, or a* Â«oon as it
1* evident that more tattled conditione have
been reached, a new run of orrters will be re
ceiviy;, for it is well understood that much
contract wr>rk has been held up by high prices.
At thÂ«> lower level manufacturers' profits are
being reduced to a rr.Sr.'.mum. tnfl labor will
sooner or Uter be obllred to recornlie the
ccanKed situation acd ailow concessions. At
â¢the lower level, to which we are now coming;
more rtaWe If lee* profitable conditions will be
reached and work will be found for all if
reason rules. The inevitable shrinkage of boom
profit* will, cf course, affect the Industrials
adversely. Fortunately, these are held by the
rubllc. as a rule, to cn!y a limited extent, and
the reorganizations or readjustment* which
must com* in due course of time will fall
heaviest upon tbÂ«lr rrocesitcrs.
"As already Ir-iimated la these advices, the
market shows a tendency to differentia**, the
hirt grade of *ecurities cutting away from the
bad. A fair recovery haÂ« been made, and now
much depends ujx>Â« monetary development*.
Stringent money trouid probably mean cheaper
stocks and vice versa."
ExcmanKT.
l*U man advices from New Tork eay:
"Our foreign trafie movemetit 1b growing
more favorable to gold imports for the reason
that exports hithmo backward are increasing
while imports are decreasing. The latter is a
new feature, the result of depression here and
a lessened demand for luxuries, and is having
th* effect of decreasing- national revenue at
a time when national expenses are at high

NEW TORK STOCK LIST,
The news that thÂ« Amslgaraated mines were
to reopen explained yesterday's advance in that
stock, hut did not help it more than a frac
tion to-day. The market closed rather dull and
weak, with Pennsylvania at 112*4. or only Yt
above the !oweÂ«. Additional engagements of
gold for import were made in London and the
further drop in exchange indicated the proba
ble continuance of the movements.

$1,545,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on the
last call.
CHICAGO. Nor. 11. â Firm cables brought

and May wheat at the start and December
opened M>G%c higher at 77%@77%c. Offerings
were light early in the day and with a fair
advance in the price of December at Minne
apolis. December advanced to 77%c within
the first hour. Later in the day weakness. in
corn with lower prices at f. Minneapolis and
New York brought heavy selling orders and the
market became very weak.' Large primary re
ceipts and small clearances helped to create
a bearish sentiment. Closing prices were at
about the bottom with December %c lower at
76Â«fcc. after It had. touched 76?4e.
Corn ruled extremely weak after a firm open.
ine. December closed at 42SS*2>ic, a loss of
Oats enjoyed a fairly steady market until
the corn break and then prices declined. De
cember closed *4@%e lower at 33%<T34c.
Provisions were sready early in the day on
a good cash business and on a strong demand
for lard, but later with grain prices showing
weakness, the market turned weak. Pork

Yesterday Theresa Dexnpsey, a domestic,
filed a suit for $23,000 damages asalcst
Charles Harley and hla wife, her former
employers. She claims that her reputa
tion has been damaged to a great extent
because Mrs. Harley remarked In the
presence of divers persons that the plain
tiff, who was employed by her as a cook,
had purchased liquor and taken It to her
room.
Wants Damages for Slander.
The circular of Somers & Co. says of Hay:
"Receipts of hay still - continue rather light,
the total lor thÂ« week just ended amounting
to 1900 tons, in comparison with 1S00 tons for.
the week preceding. The situation remains
unchanged. in every way. Town trade is very
quiet, owing to the fact that most consumers
had large amounts of hay forced on them dur
ing the early fall. M&ny of these, however,
are expected to be out of hay within the next
few weeks, and during the winter wÂ». will
have our usual fair, demand.
"The account of etock compiled by the San
Francisco Hay Association shows a total of
about 97 000 tons of hay available for this
market in districts from which wÂ« always draw
our supply. Last year's report on the first of
November showed OS, 000 tons and we had
barely enough to last us through. With an
equal demand this year we may see some
shortage next spring, especially if the crop
is late. In any event, the market will be a
sensitive one for the balance of. the. season
and we cannot but believe that rather high
prices will rule from this time on.
"Livestock cars are being utilized in the
IJvermore Valley for shipping hay, so we
are now getting a somewhat larger proportion
of the choice grades. With this exception the
market shows no change from that of last

Simpson's counsel was also granted per Â¦
mission to Introduce testimony as to the
good character of his client. The Com
missioners stated that the testimony giv
en by Captain Spillane was for the pur
pose of refreshing Policeman Murphy's
/ecollectlon. They declined to strike the
testimony from the record, but said they
would not base a decision on It.
Counsel for both sides admitted that
the case was practically closed. AH that
was lacking was the testimony of Loa
Angeles residents who would testify
against Simpson. The latter has been
granted permission to frame cross-inter
rogatories, with a view to learning wheth
er the witnesses were hostile.
At the urgent request of the attor
ney for George B. Simpson, the saloon
man who preferred charges of extortion
against Sergeant Reuben A. "Wolfe." the
Board of Police Commissioners yesterday
ruled that the various depositions Intro
duced by Attorney Metson in behalf of
Wolfe and which tended to show that
Simpson's character was bad should be
taken over again In order that the wit
nesses might be interrogated as to their
hostility to the prosecutor. An adjourn
ment was taken until next Tuesday night
and the depositions will be relniroduced.

new plant calculated to furnish feed for
sheep. If this plant will convert. the bar

claimed, it means a big awakening among

NEVADA CITY, Nov. 11.â C. P. Wilson,
a miner, who had accepted a Job cutting
wood on the Parsons place, about three
miles from Grass Valley, on the Banner
road, is missing, and his disappearance
has caused his employer and friends' to
fear that he . may have lost his life or
been done awaj\ with. Four weeks ago
Wilson drove by Waiter Cannon's place,
at Hills Flat, in a buckboard, and Can
non offered him a job cutting wood. Wil-
Bon Bald he was a miner, but having
trouble with his "lungs would accept the
job In the hope that the change of occu
pation might benefit him. He rented a cab
in on the Parsons place, stocked it with
provisions, purchased the necessary tools
and put his horse on pasture at the Han
sen place. He paid for all his supplies
and went to work. Five tiers of wood
shows what work was done. When Can
non went to the place not long ago he
found things in good order, but Wilson
was missing. The buckboard was stand
ing at the cabin, the tools were where
Wilson had been using them and the
wood that had been cut had been piled up
for measurement. A search was made in
the vicinity, but no trace of Wllson\was
found. His rent was paid in advance, he
had received nothing on the work done
and all his effects are still on the ranch.
He Is the Victim of Foul
Play.

J. A. Burton of this city will go to Los
Angeles to become a partner in the
Grant Bros.' Construction Company, a
railroad contracting firm. Burton was re
ceiver of the California and Nevada Rail
road, which he sold to the Santa Fe. Ha
has been connected with the contracting
firm named since 1890. In that period Ha
assisted in the building of a great many
miles of road and established a reputation
for efficiency. Upon the death of A. A.
Grant he acted as Grant's executor under
the will of the capitalist and closed up
his business.
The California* and Nevada Railroad

was interested. There was some litiga
tion over the bonds of the road. Burton
handled the business successfully. The
company in which Burton now becomes
a partner is engaged In constructing
about 120 miles of railway in Arizona,
from Prescott to Phoenix, and also is
building about sixty miles of road from

"AT THE OPERA." V
The first subject selected could scarcely be recogpized
by the half-tone above, "on account of the Cnpossibility- of
showing the exquisite coloring of the original by this
process.
Copies of the original which are to be given aveay are
displayed in prominent places throughout the city. Don't
fail to inspect one.
"At the Opera" has a decidedly pleasing flavor in its
composition. It depicts a beautiful, budding young
woman, rich in all the attractiveness of her young life,
and typically an American Girl.
The ideal Grecian profile, the rich coloring of her au-
burn hair, the carelessly draped opera gown, exposing
her delicately chiseled neck and bust, all combine to give
the study a distinct character. The background could not
be more aptly described than by the saying â it's Bry-
son's â as in his execution and handling of colors he .
seems to impart to his creations a bit of life and dash
seldom attained by contemporary artists.
REMEMBERâ The publisher has no possible way of
knowing just how many of this set to order; the best he
can do is to guess; and as it will take weeks for addi-
tional orders to be refilled, it seems proper to suggest
that every one wanting this beautiful "Series in Gold"
ought to order from his carrier, newsdealer or 'phone
this office in ample time. The demand will be tremen-
dous. . , .

The altar was covered with vases of
the long stemmed blossoms, among which
candles glimmered. In corners of the
chancel were masses of graceful date i
palms, which were also grouped about the
walls and balcony. At each pew were
arranged clusters of white chrysanthe
mums in tall gold cornucopias, each ex
tending several feet in height. A profu

chandeliers and many strands were grace
fully suspended. Each stained glass win

IN DOMESTIC TRAGEDY
THE wedding of Miss Julia de La
veaga and Andrew P. Welch at
St. Mary's Cathedral yesterday
morning was one of the most elab
orate that San Francisco has seen
for many a day.
Long before the appointed hour the
splendid edifice was thronged with invit
ed guests and the streets were lined with
eager onlookers, many of whom crowded
near the doors to get a glimpse of
the arrivals. One thousand invitations
had been issued and, notwithstanding the
Inclemency of the weather, several hun
dred handsomely gowned women added
their gladdening presence to the scene.
The interior of the cathedral had been
transformed into a bower of beauty
wherein white chrysanthemums and
palms were grouped with charming effect.
Perhaps the most interesting of this
offering is the block bounded by Kansas,
Nevada. De Haro and Humboldt streets.
There are four corners on this block un
sold. A desirable site for manufacturing
purposes will be sold as an entirety, and
consists of three-fifths of the 'block
bounded by Solano. De Haro. Mariposa
and Carolina streets. In addition to
these, the catalogue shows lots on Con
necticut, Arkansas, Michigan, Missouri.
Nevada and Texas streets.
Monster Credit Auction.
The Von Rhein Real Estate Company's
monster credit auction is advertised for
next Thursday. The terms of one-fifth
cash are calculated to attract buyers of
modest means. The list, in addition to
a lot on the east line of Devisadero
street, south of Union, 34:4x103 feet, and
one on the south line of Green street,
cast of Devisadero, C4:4xl37:6, includes
about eighty lots suitable for homes for
mechanics an'd other employes of the
Union Iron Works, sugar refinery, cord
ape works and similar industrial estab
lishments at the Potrero. On these lots
a cash payment of $50 only Is required;
the rest is paid in monthly installments
of $10. Twenty-fourth street cars go
â¢within a block of this property and all
other lines transfer to Twenty-fourth
street.
At a tpccial meeting pf the San Fran
cisco Grocers' Union held last night in
B'nai Brith Hall it was decided that af
ter November 15 r.o member of the or
ganization should give his customers trad
ing stamps. For the last three months
the- grocers have beÂ«n working against
the system, which, they assert, enriches
trading stamp companies to their own
loss, and their work came to a head last
ev'.-n'nc
More than 100 grocers attended the
meeting. The discussion was long and
interesting. There seemed to be a unan
imity of opinion that the gr<Â»cers of this
city should follow the example set by the
vegetable dealers and butchers and de
clir.e to give their customers a trading
stamp for every collar's worth of goods
they purchase. The grocers claim that
the trading stamp scheme deprives them
ef 5 per cent of their gross receipts. By
doing away with the practice of giving
stamps the trade will be saved from
fc'VOO to $30,000 a month. At the present
time the grocers pay one-ha!f a cent for
a stamp. Some of them stated, they lay
out as much as J125 a month for stamps.
A conference was held between the re
tcil and the wholesale grocers and the
latter promise to render the former all
the assistance in their power. Of the
H/A) retail grocers, only live declined to
give up the stamp system.
The following committee was appointed
to take up the light: William Lenhoff.
vice president of the Retail Grocers'
Union; Joseph A. Stulz, president State
Grocers' Association; J. Salomon, direc
tor Grocers' Union, and T. J. Parsons,
George Wheaton and I). Dangers, rep
resenting the wholesale grocers of the
city.
T. II. Corcoran, president of the Gro
cers' Union, presided at the meeting. He
announced tb&B on and after November
11 any grocer caught giving trading
stamps would be fined $50. v
The board designated the district in
which the Starr King and Cleveland
schools are located for the carrying out
of the compulsory education law by the
Associated Charities, which will bear the
entire expense.
The board appropriated $200 for the
teachers' institute to be held in this city
next month and $50 to defray the ex
penses of a school exhibit at the St.
Louis exposition.
Mrs. Genevieve Holden, teacher of deaf
children In the Harrison School, was au
thorized to appoint an assistant teacher,
subject to the approval of the board.
The board was so busy with other mat
ters that it did not have time to render
a decision in the case of Miss Jean Dwy
er, principal of the South End School,
who was tried for punishing Frank Dulg
nan, one of the pupils.
Miss , Katherine Â¦ Ball, supervisor of
drawing, addressed the board at length
in defense of her methods of teaching,
which have been sharply criticized by
Mrs. Hattie B. Steele. Miss Ball declared
that good results were achieved as a re
sult of her teaching and she forcefully
denounced the strictures of Mrs. Steele.
Miss Murphy, assistant teacher of draw
ing, corroborated Miss Ball. Mrs. Steele
argued that the course was too long, and
Superintendent Langdon was delegated to
inquire as to whether it could not be
shortened in some instances.
Â£ Attorney Stephen V. Costello appeared
before the board in behalf of a petition
filed by Mrs. Rebecca Greenan for a re
hearing of certain charges upon which
she was removed from her position as
principal of the John W. Taylor School.
Costello argued that some of the wit
nesses upon whose testimony Mrs.
Greenan had been dismissed had since
confessed that they had perjured them
selves. The board took the petition un
der advisement. Should .a rehearing be
granted, it will be with the understand
ing that Mrs. Greenan waive all claim
to any rights she may have to her po
sition in the School Department until the
final determination of the case.
The Board of Education yesterday* ap
pointed Miss Elizabeth E. Kelly princi
pal of the Jefferson School. This ap
pointment was foretold in The Call more
than one month apo. On the first bal
lot Miss Kelly received the votes of Di
rectors Walsh and Roncovieri and Miss
Martha Galloway those of Directors
Woodward and Mark. On the second bal
lot Miss - Galloway was supported by
Woodward alone and Miss Kelly was de
clared elected.
The board cleared Mrs. F. M. Gannon,
a teacher in the Harrison School, of
charges filed by the Retail Grocers' As
sociation. Superintendent Langdon's re
port to the effect that Mrs. Gannon her
self did not order goods from Grocer Kast
under the assumed name of. Mrs. Dan
iels, but that one of her family did, was
adopted." The board decided that it could
not compel Mrs. Gannon to pay a debt
owing to Kast, that being a matter for
the courts.
