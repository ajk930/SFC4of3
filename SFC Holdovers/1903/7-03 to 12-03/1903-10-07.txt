Admiral Evans, with; four vessels of the
United States squadron, arrived at Yoko
hama as the steamer Shinano Maru sailed.
VICTORIA, B. C, Oct. 6.-The steamer
Shinano Maru, which arrived to-day
from Yokohama, brought news that the
situation In Japan was regarded as most
critical at the time of her departure. Offi
cers of , the steamer, tell of Increased
movements of soldiers, and A. M. Knapp,
editor of the Japanese Advertiser, says
that Japan had been pouring troops into
Korea. Japan was preparing for war, he
says, and If it comes would not be taken
unawares. Russia was also continuing
warlike preparations and, according to re
liable reports from Manchuria, did not
intend to evacuate. the contrary,
troops were beinc hurried in, and the
tourist travel had been stopped on the
Russian Transcontinental Railway.
The Japanese fleet was concentrated off
Sasebo, Korea, and every vessel'of Japan
was in commission. The war feeling was
very keen throughout Japan, and Mr.
Knapp says were* it not for the fact that
Japan feels that the opinion of Great
Britain must be reckoned with in consid
eration of : the Anglo-Japanese alliance
war would have _been declared before now.
It would surprise jio one resident in
Japan, said the Yokohama editor, to hear
that war had been declared any day, and
in this connection it was a significant fact
that the Japanese transportation staff
were securing large amounts of equipment
for" winter transportation.

weeks. To quote a very, high authority
In the affairs of the corporation, "the ac
tion of the board was unanimous and was
caused by the falling off of business."
This is borne out V-the financial state
ment issued shortly after the meeting.
The statement shows a decrease of $4,642,
068 CSeptember estimated) for. the third
quarter of the calendar year, compared
with the same period last year, and a
decrease of $4,239,487 compared with the
preceding quarter' of this year. On Octo
ber -1, 1902, the corporation had unfilled
orders .for 4.843,000 ..tons on hand. This
year the unfilled orders on the same date
amounted to 3,728,324 tons. .
The official statement of net earnings
for the quarter (September estimated)
shows: July, $12.3S4,647; August, $10,819,
174; September, $9,000,000.
The course of steel common recently
clearly Indicated .that to-day's cut has
been largely -discounted.-- In fact, wagers
that the dividend .would- be reduced were
plentiful recently and there were predic
tions that It would be passed completely.
Nevertheless to-day's action came as a
surprise to many who argued that it
would be Impolitic to make any change
at .this particular time. .
The Importance of .to-day's meeting,
which was preceded by of the finance
committee,' was emphasized by the at
tendance of", nineteen of the twenty- four
directors, including j". P. Morgan, whose
presence. at these meetings has been very
rare. jV Among the absentees were John
D. Rockefeller and his "son, John D. Jr. ;
William H. Moor and Marshall Field of
Chicago. The absence of the Rockefellers
was the subject of some comment, be
cause of the rumors industriously circu
lated for weeks past that the Standard
Oil faction had arrayed .itself against
Mr. Morgan and his friends and would
hold out for a reduced dividend. The
unanimous action of the board on this
point, however, disposed of these rumors.
The regular dividend of 1% per cent on
the preferred stock was declared. This
dividend is payable on November 16. The
dividend on the common stock is payable
on December 30.
The statement for the nine months gives
the total net earnings, after monthly de
ductions for repairs, renewals, mainte
nance and interest on bonds and fixed
charges of the subsidiary companies, . as
$94,014,836. Deducting amounts ;for sink
ing funds on bonds of subRidlary com
panies and. depreciation and reserve funds
brings the net earnings down to 582,211,692.
A further ' deduction of interest on the
corporation's bonds, including the sinking
funds, leaves a balance of $65,978,217. Divi
dends- on the .. preferred and common
shares for the , nine - months aggregate
$36,629,475, leaving a balance of undivided
profits or surplus for that period of
$29,348,742.
Trading in the steel- stocks was the
chief feature of the mancet to-day. The
common stock sold as low as lo^, ad
vanced a full point from that figure and
closed at 17%, a fractional net gain. The
preferred" stock, on heavier > transactions,
sold as hisrh as 66. : but closed at 64%,'- a
one : point gain on the day. Dealings In
the sinking fund bonds were in very large
volume, the price ranging from 71 -to 72%.
A - little', more ; than three ', months ago, 4
just before the last rejjular dividend on
steel common was declared, that: stock
sold around. 40. Since then It has sold as

BURNS, Or.. Oct 6.â In a bloody battle
fought in the wilds of Harney County,
John Santon, a. prominent attorney of
Burns, and John West, -were shot dead
â¢ by John Frost, alias Harry Egbert, a fu
gitive burglar wanted in Roseburg. The
two victims had been sworn in as special
t>eputy Sheriffs and were attempting to
capture the desperado.
Egbert, who is an ex-convict, having
â¢ served time in the Salem, penitentiary,
had once been arrested by. Santon, but
pave him the slip and escaped. He eluded
the officer from September 23 to October
' 4*,. on which day Santon and Jack West
<-ame up Â¦with him at the ranchhouse of
Charles FleJds In Wild Horse Valley, 123
miles south of Burns.
BATTLE IN A HOUSE.
Egbert and his wife were in the house
alpne and as the two pursuers approached
Egbert opened fire with a rifle from be
hind a corner of the building. West
turned to run and the second shot struck
him in the back and he fell paralyzed.
Banton kept Egbert'6 corner covered with
his rifle and Egbert climbed into the house
through a window.. Santon dashed in at
the door and Egbert's .. wife fled to the
woods.
PSanton dropped his rifle, drew a revol
cr and with this weapon fought his
death struggle. Egbert had his rifle and
the two kept firing at each other through
a thin board partition. Santon was shot
through the right shoulder, but kept up
the battle, using his left hand to fire his
pistol.
. Egbert finally withdrew to the upper
story. West then called Santon from the
' house to bring him a drink of water. San
ton seems to have gone twice to the
spring before the murderer concluded to
kill him. Then as he turned away from
the dylnc "West, he was shot through the
center of the breast.
OUTLAW BIDES FREE.
After the double killing Egbert went on
foot to a ranch five miles away and de
manded a horse to ride. The farmer re
fused to give him an animal and the des
perado took what he wanted at the muz
zle of his gun and rode away. Since then
jio word has been heard of him.
â¢ Sheriff Allen, the Coroner and a new
posse are now in the vicinity and will
make a close chase. Messages have been
wTred in every direction, but Wild Horse
Valley Is pne of the most isolated re
gions on the Pacific. Coast and the start
Egbert has will give him a good oppor
tunity to escape. He is supposed to be
near the California boundary line, headed
for Modoc County, where he has relatives.
The body of Santon has been brought
in to the morgue here. A reward of 5500
was Immediately offered by the Harney
County Court for Egbert's capture, dead
or alive.

VENTURA. Oct 6.-Miss Grace Flem
ing, or Mrs. Grace Fleming Luddy, as the
case may be, and Archie Van Curen at
tempted to elope this morning, but their
plans were frustrated by J. H. Luddy,
with the assistance of Under Sheriff
Rellly. JK@|
The couple intended, it is BaM, to go
to the Klondike, and might have suc
ceeded but the officer arrived at the
depot a few minutes before the train
started. <â¢
Upon this exciting Incident hangs a
tale of considerable mystery, and Ventura
is' eater for details -of the affair which
culminated so unromantically.
Luddy is a prominent retired capitalist
of Southern California. The woman is
a handsome and dashing blonde, about
thirty years old. â¢ She was stylishly
dressed. Several thousand dollars' worth
of. diamonds also figured in the affair.
At the Hotel Rose Mrs. Luddy registered
as Grace Virginia of Wheeler Hot Springs.
In all . it is a most perplexing affair
for the. curious. "Miss Fleming," as she
registers at the hotel, claims to have
secured a divorce in Los Angeles last
Saturday from Luddy. Luddy has her
held on a charge of perjury for swearing
In court that they, were married. He
further claims - that she has numerous
diamonds valued at several thousand dol
lars and which > he wants returned. . He
states that they were never married. ;
Mrs. Luddy says that she and Mr.
Luddy were married secretly two years
ago in Santa Barbara. This secret mar
riage, she declares, was at her request.
She claims that the diamonds are not in
her possession as they were stolen from
Luddy at a hotel in Los Angeles over a
year ago.
During the past year Luddy and ' Mrs.
Luddy or Miss Fleming have resided at
Wheeler Hot Springs, where they, have
enjoyed life. The divorce^ according to
Mrs. Luddy, was obtained on " the ground
of â¢ desertion. ,

The speaker paid the highest tribute to
Balfour, with whose principles and poli
cies he fully agreed, and said. he admired
the courage and resource with which the
Premier had faced difficulties unsurpassed
in' political' history. Chamberlain con
tinued:
It seems as though In this country there have
always been men who do not know the mean
ing of loyalty and friendship. To them I say
that nothing they may do will have the slight
est influence to affect in the slightest degree
the friendship and confidence existing between
tho Premier and myself. To my friends and
â¢upporters In the great . struggle on which I
have entered ' I say, give no encouragement to
mean or llbelous insinuations, for In ' no con
ceivable circumstances will I. allow myself to
be In [ any sort of . competition, direct or In
direct, -.with ' my friend and , leader.
LOYAL TO THE PREMIER.
, I do not rerari this as a party meeting. I
am no longer a party leader, but an outsider.
I do not think it right to raise any exqlaslve
party issues, but after what has occurred since
the meeting at Sheffield a word 'or two might
be.Blven'me to say that, though I am no
longer a leader," I am still a loyal servant of
the party whose union and strength are essen
tial to the welfare' of the empire and which
has ' found a leader whom every man may be
proud to ' follow. '
NO LONGEB PARTY LEADER, j
Chamberlain, , commencing his speech,
said that his first duty was to thank the
great representative audience for offer
ing him the opportunity of explaining for
the first time in some detail his views on
the subject of the fiscal policy in the city
from which free trade first took birth
and in which Adam Smith taught.
He paid a tribute to Adam Smith, to
whom; however, he said, it was not given
to foresee all the changes which had oc
curred during the last centuryand a half.
Adam Smith, nevertheless, was aware of
the importance of home markets com
pared with foreign ones, and Chamberlain
had been impressed by the manner In
which he advocated retaliation under cer
tain conditions, and how "he urged recip
rocal trade between the colonies and the
mother country.. Hence the speaker was
not afraid in Glasgow to combat free-im
ports "and preach preference to the colo
nies. "It was known to every man that
Scotland had contributed out of all pro
portion to her population to the building
up of the empire which genius, capacity
and courage had created and maintained.
Chamberlain said: . I;, i
cost of the new duties to the laborer
would be 9!Â£ farthings (4% -cents), to the
artisan 10 farthings (5 cents), while the
saving by the proposed reduction to the
laborer would be 18 farthings (9 cents) and
to the artisan l!) farthings (9% cents).
A distinguished company of -Peers and
members of the House of- Commons "were
present, with ., a _host of -ladles, including
Mrs. - Chamberlain, whose .great Interest
In - her husband's i political career has - in
duced her to accompany him throughout
his entire campaign.. The hall was crowd
ed to suffocation as early as 6 o'clock. :
â¢When the applause which greeted his
arrival had â¢ subsided - Chamberlain
to speak, and in addition to ; encouraging
cheers from time to time in ' the course
of his oration he was greeted at the close
with a great demonstration.^' /
The ; points . of ' his speech attracting , re
markable attention jwere ; his eulogy, of
Balfour. arid his repudiation of .the idea
of superseding him; 1 his representation" of
the coming -struggle as one greater in
its consequence than the Boer war;'*his
declaration", that air ;workingmeri' in the
colonies v?were , protectionists and that ; any
labor ;leader ; visiting the -colonies ..would
inevitably ; be , converted - to . protection ; his
description of the : American ' tariff ; as \ an
abomination," and 1 his curious presentation
of *Â¦ the ' case as . affecting the workmen's
exchequer. * \ - v
- Thus/ according to him, . the Increased
probable issue of his campaign,
it is generally admitted that he has
opened it in a masterly manner befitting
the momentous occasion, and that he can
no longer be accused of nebulosity In pre
senting his case. For nearly two hours
to-night. Only referring occasionally to
fairly full notes for figures "and statistics,
he held a vast and enthusiastic audience
absorbed by one of his finest oratorical
efforts,
â¢s As though inspired by the knowledge
that the practical, collapse and .break-up
of the Unionist party left him in sole pos
session of the field, he spoke with more
than his customary. energy and persua
siveness, lacking-nothing in lucidity, either
of -phrase, or argument, . while his. appeal

The Japanese statesmen remain calm.
Japan apparently, considers herself capa
ble of dealing with Russia single-handed.
It is true that England is supporting" Ja
pan strongly In Peking and Seoul, Korea,
but it is thought here that England and
France desire peace at any price. Ger
many is ostensibly neutral. The United
States is chiefly concerned in her com
mercial treaty with China, to be signed
on October 8. but the Japanese press
claims that America is ready to give Ja
pan her strong moral support against any
unfair encroachments.
Popular feeling in Japan is exasperated
at Russia's dilatory tactics and the ex
citement has been aggravated by the sen
sational press, which is constantly circu
lating rumors of fresh Russian aggres
sions. Many pt these are of the most
circumstantial character and are calcu
lated to inflame public opinion. The offi
cials deprecate these reports, which, it is
believed in some quarters, emanate from
Russian sources, with the' object of forc
ing Japan's hand.

YOKOHAMA, Oct.;, 6.â With the ap
proach of October 8, -' the nominal date
for Russia's evacuation of Manchuria,
great tension is observable among the
Japanese populace, but in diplomatic cir
cles it is reaffirmed that hopefulness pre
vails of an amicable "settlement of the
imbroglio between Russia and Japan, on
the basis of minor concessions by Russia
in Korea and Manchuria, though officials
do not profess to expect that the evacu
ation of Manchuria will' be effected on
the exact date named.

ister to Japan/has returned here from a

So secret had everything been kept that
only Miss Prichard and Leonard Cook, a
clerk in Lakeport, who stood as witness
to the ceremony, knew of the binding 1 of
the love-knot. Among Miss Floyd's city
friends, even in the family where she
made her home, not an inkling of her
marriage had been received.
That the former Miss Floyd Is one who
is wont to scorn conventions and take the
bull by the horns has been demonstrated
already. Last September she instituted
suit in the Superior Court of Lake Coun
ty to break the trust which has her es
tate in hand and come to her own.
When her mother. Cora L. Floyd, died
In 1893 she stipulated In her will that the
estate should be left \ in the hands of
James T. Boyd, Adolpheus D. Grimwood
and Cora Skeeler as trustees. Two
thirds of the income should be given to
Miss Floyd, the sole legatee, and the
other third expended upon improvements
of the property. Miss Floyd's suit to
break this arrangement was lost and her
estate is consequently still held In trust.
It comprises the beautiful summer
home. Kono Tayee, on Clear Lake, the
Quercus ranch in the same vicinity. North
Point dock and warehouse in this city
and property In Merced, Alameda, San
Luis Obispo, Monterey and Santa Clara
counties.
Finally Miss Floyd, accompanied by
Miss Prlchard, went up to her beautiful
summer home on Clear Lake. Then the
letters began to be left by the postman
at ' the humble doorstep of Gopchevitch,
out at 2284 Mission street. Suddenly the
gripman asked for a leave of absence.
There was a hurried Journey to Lakeport,
Superior Judge Sayrd said a few words
over tjvo clasped hands in his chambers
yesterday, and the romance had reached
its denouement.
SECRET IS KEPT.
To the heiress Gopchevitch told his
story- Of the old house of Obrenovitch
was heâ the dynasty which came to such
a bloody end in Belgrade's palace. The
blood of robber barons of the Balkans
coursed his veins. He was an heir to the
throne; a pretender of the deposed
Obrenovitch es. The heiress heard and
she was captivated.
In her daily Journeys to and fro on the
cars which passed the house. Miss Bllza
G. Prlchard, the boon companion of Mis3
Floyd, chanced to strike up an acquaint
ance with Gopchevitch. Through her
Miss Floyd came to have a smile and a
pleasant word for the gripman when she
chanced to be on his car.
After a while It always chanced that
It was Gopchevitch's car upon which
Miss Floyd rode, and the rules against
talking to the grriprnan were sadly
broken as the little tete-a-tetes on the
dummy grew In frequency. But never a
word was said at the family table about
cable" cars or gripmen.
Miss Floyd is ihe daughter of the late
Captain Richard S. Floyd, a retired of
ficer of the navy, who was prominent a j
the secretary of the famous Lick trust.
Upon his death and that of his wife Miss
Floyd was left the sole heir to $700,000.
which Is held In trust for her. After ex
tensive travel and a perfect education.
Miss Floyd had gone to live with Mrs.
W. B. Prlchard, a distant relative, at 2833
Sacramento street, when the romance of
her courtship commenced.
The rank Is bat the guinea"*' stamp.
The man's the gowd for a.' that.
A prince can make a belted knight.
A marquis, duke and a' that;
But an honest man's aboon his might.
Guld faith, he mauaaa fa' that.
J^obby Burns of Immortal memory has
found at least one disciple In this mater
ialistic age and that one is Miss Harry
A. L. Floyd, heiress to nigh a million.
Yesterday before the Superior Judge at
Lakeport she- gave her hand and fortune
to B. M. Gopchevltch. a Servian noble
man, who up to the day of bis wedding
was a gripman on a Sacramento-street
cable car.
In the olden days the noblemen were
wont to woo their lady love *neath cast!Â«
wall and then carry her from her ances
tral home on a prancing steed. But to
day your nobleman wears a uniform In
stead of his suit of shining wÂ«tl and
carries his lady's heart away on a street
car. Such are the sad ways of our work
aday age.
Albeit that the knight errant wore a
vizored bat instead of a coronet and that
his hands .were more accustomed to the
brake than to the sword, romance Is not
lacking in this tale of a nobleman's suc
cessful wooing. The man * who onca
clanged the bell and warned passengers
to look out for the curve is now copartner
In his bride's wealth. ' The woman can
now put a crest on her carriage door,
even though the 'scutcheon be quartered
by a cable car rampant.

Chamberlain believed that It was only
by a' commercial union and reciprocal
preference that they could lay the founda
tions ' of. a federation , of the empire to
which they all looked as a brilliant* pos
sibility. " He wished to I repeat explicitly
that he did not wish to tax raw materials
used in Britl3h manufactures. It was evi
dent that if they wanted to prevent 1 sep
jaration there must be a preferential tax
Suppose we had made euch an offer to the
United States and Germany ten or twenty
years ago, do you suppose that we should not
have been able to retain a great deal of what
we have now lost and cannot recover? I will
glva you an illustration: America ls the strict
est of the protective nations. It has a tariff
which to me is an abomination, it is so im
moderate, unreasonable and unnecessary, and,
although America has profited enormously. I
think it has been carried to excessive lengths;
and I believe that a great number of intelli
gent Americans would gladly negotiate. with us
for its reduction. But, until very recently,
even this immoderate tariff left ua the great
tlnplate trade, amounting to millions of pounds
per annum, and which we might have kept if
we had given soma reciprocal advantages. It
would not have been worth America's while to
put a duty upon an article for which it had
no particular use or special aptitude.
If we had made some concessions to Ger
many we 6hould still have been exporting to
that country many articles the market for
which is now closed to us.
Were we to lose the colonies as we lost our
foreign â¢ trade, we should have arrived at the
parting of the ways. If the opportunity is not
seized now, it will not recur. Canada will
fall to the level of the United States, Australia
to the level of Canada and South Africa to
the level of Australia, and that would be the
beginning of a general decline which would rob
us of our most important trade. l Â» .
FEDERATION OF THE EMPIRE.
Chamberlain said he believed that the
colonies ".are prepared to meet us in re
turn for a very moderate preference. They
would reserve to us the trade we already
enjoy, and would also arrange their tar
iffs in the future in order not to start In
dustries in competition with those al
ready in existence in the mother country,
and not only would they enable us to re
tain our trade with them, but they would
give us preference on all trade done with
them by our foreign competitors."
The colonial trade thus secured, said
the speaker, would be such as to secure
employment for 615,000 workmen at 30
shillings, a week, and, calculating their
f amlles, to give subsistence to \ 3,075.000
persons. That had been called a squalid
argument; therefore, he appealed on the
higher ground that. the privileges of the
empire brought with them great responsi
bilities. ' He had spoken with many col
onists who believed that the ;. present
colonial relations could not be permanent.
They must either be drawn closer to
gether or they would drift apartâ an opin
ion "shared by Lord Rosebery, a states
man, whose Instincts were always right,
but his acts often lagged behind his,In
stincts.
AS TO AMERICA'S TARIFF.
"Wo can intervene now, but it is doubtful if
we could intervene twenty years hence. We
could Bay to our great colonies: "We under
stand your views and aspirations, and do not
care to dictate or think ourselves superior to
you; we recognize our right to develop your in
dustries so as r.ot to be dependent on foreign
supplies, but Â¦ there are many things you Uo
not know . how to make . for which we have a
great capacity of production; leave them to us;
do not increase the tariff walls against us; let
us exchange with you for your productions; do
It because we are kinsmen, because it is good
for the empire as a whole, and because we
have taken the first step and set you the ex
ample. We offer you a preference; we rely
upon your . patriotism and your affection that
we shall not be losers thereby,"
Australasia is less developed and takes more
than Canada. In the Caoe there are prac
tically, no industries.
Now. what is the history of protection?
First, there is tariff and no industries. Then
gradually primary industries Â¦ for which the
country has natural facilities grow up behind
the tarlft wall. then secondary 'industries
spring up; first of necessaries, then of luxuries,
until at last all the ground ls covered.
The countries to which I have referred are
in different stages of the protective process.
In the United States the process ls completed.
She produces everything and excludes every
thing. There is no trade to be done with her
for a paltry *lx shillings per head. â¢
Canada has been protective a long 1 time.
The principal industries are there and you
can never get rid of them, but the secondary
indUBtriea have not yet been created and there
ls an immense trade still open to you to main
tain and increase. ,
protective countries. *
I see that some of Â»ur labor leaders are
persuading the workmen to maintain the sys
tfcm of free imports. 1 undertake to say that
not one of 'them could vlalt the colonies for
elx months: without singing a' different tune.
The vast majority of the workmen in the
colonies are protec^tlgpistS. _and I am disin
clined to accept the "easy explanation that they
are all fools. I fall to understand why. a
man who is intelligent here becomes an idiot
when he goes to Australia. He does, however,
get rid of a number of old-world prejudices
and superstitions.
On the other hand the protected countries,
which you have been -told, and I myself one
time believed, were going rapidly to wreck
and;ruin, have progressed Infinitely better in
proportion -than ourselves, and, instead of, as
Cobden believed, our remaining the workshop
for the world we are sending less and less
of our manufactures abroad, while the pro
tected countries are sending more and more
of their manufactures here. Thus our manu
factured exports from XllO.OOO.WJO in 1872
have gradually dwindled to Â£73,500,000 in 1902
to the protected countries of Europe and the
United- States.. -
In the same period our exports to non
manufacturing countries like Egypt, China ana
South America have practically remained un
changed. This loss of trade to the orotected
countries hag not ! been noticed hitherto, be
cause during the same period our exports to
the British colontes have increased on a ratio
to counterbalance this loss and are now more
valuable than our trade with the whole of
Burope and the -United States together. Our
colonial trade, in fact, is the most rapidly
increasing, important and valuable of all our
trade. Meanwhile foreign exports to the
United Kingdom have risen from Â£03,000,000
in 1S76 to Â£142,000,000 in 1902. I do not com
ment on. that,- but when I am told that we
ought to hold the same opinions as our an
cestors I reply that we should if the cir
cumstances required the same.
I have made these figures clear. It is plain
that our imperial trade is essential to our pros
perity. If it declines or falls to increase In
proportion to our population and to the loss
of our foreign trade then we shall sink into
a fifth-rate nation. We have reached our
highest point, and I am not certain but that
some of my opponents regard that with abso
lute complacency. I have the misfortune to
be an optimist. I do. not believe in the set
ting of thÂ©- British star, but then I do
not believe in the folly of the British people.
I trust them and trust the working classes.
I have confidence that they who are our
masters, electorally speaking, -will have the
intelligence to see that they must wake up,
that they must meet the new conditions with
an altogether new policy.
REPLIES TO LABOR LEADERS.
Have you ever considered why Canada takes
a much larger amount per head of British
manufactures than the United Â¦ States, Aus
tralia thrice as much as Canada and South
Africa more than Australia.? These are all
Adducing statistics, Chamberlain con
trasted the moderate increase of IVi per
cent In the export trade of Great Britain
and the increase of 30 per cent In her pop
ulation since 1872 with the enormous in
crease of trade in the United States and
Germany, and asked how the country
could expect to support its growing pop
ulation with its trade practically, stag
nant for thirty years. He proceeded:
I do not say that I anticipate such a fate
for-the British Empire, but I eay I see signs
of decay â cracks and crevices showing that the.
foundations are not" broadband deep enough to
sustain it. Am I 'wrong .-to warn you? Is it
not strange and inconsistent that the same
people who indicted the Government for its un
preparedness in the South African war should
now denounce me in language equally extrava
gant because I want to prepare you for a strug
gle so serious that if we are defeated this coun
try will lose its" place among the great nations ;

antiquated methods and tactics?

up the position of a pioneer, I go in front of
the army. If the army is attacked I will re
turn to it. I am always an optimist. It is
possible that the nation may be prepared to
gQ further than the official programme. I now
ask the question. Is it so prepared? Great
Britain in the past has played a great part in
the world's history. I desire her to continue
and see the realization of the great Ideal of
an empire such an the world has never seen.
If that ls to be attained, this matter should
bÂ« treated on its merits without any personal
feeling or bitterness and without entering on
questions of trorely party controversy.
The late Colonial Secretary alluded to
the recent visit he paid to Venice, when
he found the Campanile, which had stood
for centuries and which, when he pre
viously visited Venice, seemed as perma
nent as the city Itself, a mass of ruins.
He continued:
The Grand Encampment Begins Officially at
# Paso Robles and the Nomination of
Officers Are Made for the Election To-Day
The question was, what would the col
onies say? He believed they would treat
generously any offer Great Britain might
make. Chamberlain concluded:
It is because I sympathize with their object
and appreciate the generosity of their offer â it
is for these things and for no personal ambi
tion that I have given up the office I was so
proud to hold, and that now, when I. might. 1
think, fairly claim a period of rest. I have
taken up new burdens and come before you a?
a missionary of the empire to urge upon you
again â as in the old times, when I protested
against the disruption of the United Kingdom
âonce again to warn you. to urge you, to im
plore you to do nothing that will tend toward
tha disintegration of the empire; not to refust
to sacrifice futile superstition and inept preju
dice and thereby to lose the result of centuries
of noble effort and patriotic endeavor.
RESTS WITH THE COLONIES.
The loss to the exchequer he estimated
at Â£2,800,000, but that and more he pro
posed to find in another branch of the
policy of financial reform, which was
sometimes called retaliation and some
times reciprocity. Ho hoped, for one
thing, that the other countries would re
duce their duties so that worse things
might not come upon them, but he
'thought that Great Britain also would
have to raise hers. A moderate duty of
10 per cent on manufactured goods, vary
ing according to the amount of labor in
them, would give to the exchequer Â£9.000,
000 a year, and If he were Chancellor of
the Exchequer he would make use of that
sum for the remission of taxation.
on food. That was the great cry of his
opponents, and it was true, but it was
only half the truth. Those opponents for
get to add his explanation that nothing
he proposed would add one farthing to
the cost of living of any worklngman or
of any family In the country.
CHAMBERLAIN'S PROGRAMME.
With regard to his plan, he would state
it briefly. He proposed to put a low duty,
not exceeding 2 shillings (48 cents) a quar
ter on foreign corn, but none on corn
from the British possessions. He pro
posed no tax on maize, partly because It
formed the food \ of some of the very
poorest among the population. He pro
posed a corresponding law on flour, and
he would. give especial preference to the
miller, with the object of re-establishing
one of our ancient Industries and of pre
venting a rush from the country to the
town, and also of placing corn and feed
ing stuffs more cheaply within the pos
session of the farmer.
A small tax of about E per cent on the'
foreign meat and dairy products would
be imposed, excluding bacon, which swas
the food, of many of the poorest of the
population. Lastly, he proposed to give
a substantial preference to the colonies
on wines and fruits. ' :
Against these Increases he proposed
some great remissions. He proposed to
take off three-quarters of the duty on tea,
half the duty on sugar, with correspond
ing reductions upon. cocoa and coffee. The
net result of these impositions and re
missions would be that the town artisan's
food would, to' the most elabor
ate calculations, cost him -two pence half
penny (five cents) less per week than it
did at present, while that of the agri
cultural laborer would cost him two
pence (four cents) less;, but, if, as he
believed, a great part of the tax on food
would be paid by . the foreigner, there,
would be a reduction in the cost of
food both for the artisan and the agri
cultural laborer.

The father of young* Douglas declares
his son's reputation can easily be proved
excellent, and that he had got out of a
sick bed only a few days before the whip
ping episode.
Q -K-K Â¦!Â¦ I"M"M"M 'Â¦l"H"H"I"M"M-I- O
Both Bockrath and his wife declare that
there is no truth in Douglas' story that
he was beaten by men immediately after
the horsewhipping scene, and that what
ever bruises Douglas shows are due to the
lashes of Mrs. Bockrath's whip, punctu
ated by a few blows from her husband's
fists.
SACRAMENTO, Oct 6.â "I horse
whipped Philip Douglas,"" "said
Mrs. Charles Bockrath in the City
Justice's Court to-day, "and un
der the circumstances I would do
it again."
Justice' March held that the courts of
fered a remedy if young Douglas had
broken the law in going with Mrs. Bock
rath's pretty 16-year-old daughter, and
that, inasmuch as Bockrath and his wife
had pleaded guilty of the charge of bat
tery preferred by Douglas, he would fine
them $20 each.
Mr. and Mrs. Bockrath paid their fines,
but Mrs. Bockrath insisted that she had
done right.
"What can a mother do under such cir
cumstances?" said Mrs. Bockrath in an
interview to-day. "It is not a crime pun
ishable by arrest and imprisonment for a
young man of 23 or 24 to keep the com
pany of a girl of* 16, even though the
parents believe he is not a proper asso
ciate for her. The most the parents of
the girl can do is to reason with the
young man and ask him if he will not
wait until the girl becomes of age and
visit her at her home, and then if. in vio
lation of a promise, he continues to go
with that. girl, the parents should do as
I have don&T-take a horsewhip to him.
"This is the second time I have horse
whipped Douglas in a public place, for the
reason that it is the second time he has
broken his promise to quit paying atten
tion to my daughter. My daughter is a
good, pure girl, and I believe It is my duty
as a mother to watch out for her and to
protect her with a horsewhip whenever
it seems to me she needs such protection.
"I believe there are many other mothers
who should do the same for their daugh
ters, and they should be commended for
it and not subjected to the annoyance of
arrest. I have pleaded guilty, first be
cause I horsewhipped , Douglas as he
charges, and second because . I did not
want to drag my daughter into a trial In
court."
The admiral, also withdraws the letter
he wrote to the Admiralty demanding an
unreserved apology from General Hunter
and expresses his sorrow at the personal
remarks. The incident is now closed.

der the present plans is $500,000, and in ad
dition to this sum an endowment for the
library Itself of $1,000,000. It Is reported,
will also b^ given.
The plans for the new structure call for
a three-story edifice, 340 feet by 145 feet.
It will occupy a position to the northeast
of the main quadrangles and will directly
face the recently completed chemistry

Is to conform with that of the other uni

o'clock to-night. At about noon he sank
into a deep sleep, and it was with difficul

who has been attending him during his

EUREKA. Oct. Â«.â A disastrous col
lision occurred yesterday morning at 8:15
o'clock* near Fortuna between an extra
and the regular freight train on the San
Francisco and- Northwestern Railroad.
Two men have died from injuries sus
tained in the accident and two others
were severely but not seriously hurt. The
dead are:'
CHARLES STILL, fireman on the ex
tra.
HENRY LOWE, brakeman on the
freight;
ThÂ» injured are Alexander Hutchinson,
brakeman on the freight, who received
a wrenched back and a badly bruised left
leg,' and Peter Clark, conductor on the
freight, wbo had his face and body bad
ly bruised and his neck wrenched- The
fatalities would have been greater had
not most of the crew savpd themselves
by Jumping from, tbe trains before they
came together.
The collision was caused either by a
misunderstanding of orders or by viola
tion of them. Conductor Rolley says he
received orders giving him the right of
way. while Conductor Clark maintains
that he had orders to take the siding at
Xewberg, but these were subsequently
countermanded and he was proceeding in
his usual way.
The northbound train, loaded with
freight and lumber, started from Scotia,
while the southbound, an extra, consist
ing of an engine and empty â¢ natcars,
started from Fields Landing. Both trains
were under orders, but what orders it Is
Impossible to say. The fronfend of each
engine was attached to the bead car and
they were hauling the train tenders in
front. William Snure, a brakeman of tbe
extra was on the lookout and upon hear
ing the approaching freight gave warn
ing to Engineer Riordan. The latter told
him to see how close it was, but before
he could comply the tenders of the two
engines came together with terrific im
pact.. Neither engine left the track, but
the tender of each was demolished. A re
markable fact is that neither engineer
was Injured, though each stayed with his
engine and did everything possible to pre
vent a collision.
DEATH SUMMONS
WILSON BISSELL
The services were the prescribed funeral
services of the Episcopal church. The
musical programme was rendered by the
choir of St. John's and the string or
chestra of the Marine Band. The three
hymns rendered were sung at the cabled
request of Lady Herbert and were the
same as those rendered at the funeral
services to-day In Great Britain.
Owing to unavoidable absence from the
city, none. of Sir Michael Herbert's asso
ciate Embassadors were present at the
services, but all of them telegraphed to
Mr. Raikes their sincere regret.
The burial service was conducted by
the Archdeacon of Wiltshire, Canon
Meade and Canon Oliver. The music in
cluded an Interlude specially composed by
Sir Hubert Parry, director of the Royal
College of Music. The body was laid in
a flower-lined grave in the churchyard-
Wreaths were sent by Cornelius Van
derbllt, Mrs. Ogden Goelet. the Earl and
Countess of Yarmouth and the American
Society In London.
The report that Sir Michael died in the
Roman Catholic faith is unfounded.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6. â Services,
solemn and impressive, in memory ol the
late Sir Michael Herbert, the Embassador
of Great Britain to the United States,
were held to-day tn St. John's Episcopal
Church. They were attended by the
President and Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss
Roosevelt, - members of the Immediate
family of Lady Herbert, President Roose

corps, members of the United States Su
preme Court, distinguished officers of -toe

baesador Choate, Secretary White and

Workingmen who supported Schmitz In
1901 remark: "We cannot support Eugene
E. Bcnmitz this trip. He is so hopelessly
tied up to Ruef and Parry and the colt
that he cannot do what he knows he
ought to do."
Tbe organization committee of the
United Republican Committee knows that
many labor union men who voted for
Schmitz two years ago are lending their
support to tbe Republican candidate for
Mayor in this campaign. The announce
ment made by Julius Kabn at the busi
ness men's meeting night before last to
the effect that F. W. Dohrxnann was a
supporter of Henry J. Crocker for Mayor
was a topic of comment In mercantile cir
cles yesterday. .
M. D. Hyde, commander-in-chief of
the Army and Navy Republican League,
has Issued the following:
BAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 6. 1003.
To the Colonels and Officers ot tbe Camps
of the Army and Navy Leagues of San Fran

meet at the headquarters, 41S Montgomery
street, room 4. at 2 p. rn., October 11, for con
sultation regarding what action you will â¢ take
in the coming reuiicipal campaign in San Fran
cisco. It is desired that every r camp be, fully
represented, that a full and free discussion be
TOO MUCH BUEF.
Already the fact is accepted in political
circles that the race In this campaign
Is between Crocker and Schmitz. Lane
la a limping third in the running. Former
United States -Senator A. P. Williams,
in a recent speech to Republican business
men at the Union League Club, frankly
told his hearers that the fight was be
tween the Republican and Union Labor
nominees. Similar utterance was given
by Mayor Schmitz at a meeting In the
Twenty-eighth district last night. The
prediction is freely made that Democratic
business men and taxpayers perceiving
the trend of the combat, will vote for
Mr. Crocker.
All signs point to a great popular
demonstration in favor of Henry J.
Crocker's candidacy for Mayor at the
Alhaxnbra Theater next Saturday night-
It is the talk In the Â¦ improvement clubs
and labor organizations that the time has
ccme for the election of a flm-class busi
ness man to administer the affairs of
San Francisco.
FTom every district the assurance cornea
that the Republicans are united and con
fident of victory. A record-breaking ma
jority for the entire Republican ticket
would not surprise the politicians. Com
ment is made "on the fact that the aver
age Republican vote In San Francisco at
the general election of 1302 was 23.00},
against the average Democratic vote of
24,000. There are many indications that

Special DUp&toh to ThÂ« C&!1.
AUSTIN. Nev., Oct. 6.â Deputy Sheriff
Bhea of Berlin, Nye County, arrived this
evening with the news of the most atro
cious crime ever committed In this sec
tion. The victim was an aged and inof
fenslvo woodchopper named Humbert,
who was. beyond doubt, murdered for
money that he was supposed to have In
his possession but which was in the hands
of another. After the assassination his
body was burned.
Shea saj-s he had $80 !n cash and orders
calling for $234 more which had been en
trusted to his keeping by the woodchop
per On September U to turned the
funds over to John Erendt at the request
â¢of Huir-txTt. as the latter Intended to
com* to Austin soon for medical treat
ment. Brer.<it offered the money to
Humbert, but was requested to keep it
over night. On the following day Hum
bert took the funds from Brendt and,
-keepinjr J5. pave the coin and orders to
Maurice O'Brien who was to retain them
until they were called for. Humbert re
rr.alr.ed in Berlin all day and the follow
ing r.'.ght. after purchasing supplies for
his cubin in Union Canyon, three miles
and a half distant, left with less than
j; in his pockets.
. Recently Earl Huyck arrived in Berlin
from Reese River and Informed Shea
that Humbert's cabin had been destroyed
by fire and it was thought that the aged
nian's remains were in the ruins, as he
had not been seen since the blaze. Shea
and several others departed for the scene
arid started to remove the debris where
the cabin had stood. In a short time
th"y came upon the charred body of
Humbert, the flesh being all burned off
except at the waist. The upper portion
of the body was in what remained of the
fireplace and rested as lf It had been
placed there.
Dr. Mann examined the body, and in
the back of the head there was a hole
as if from a bullet. The physician then
removed the top of the skull and found
the bullet lodged near one of the temples.
â¢This proved that" crime had been com
mitted and that the cabin had been fired
to hide all trace of the murder. Humbert
had been shot from, behind.
The officials have thus far been unable
to find the slightest clue to the perpe
trator of the crime.

T40 Market StreetThe Democrats have completed their State ticket
in Massachusetts and a band of reputable but mis
guided men of that commonwealth are on the march
to defeat at the polls. Yet the affair is not as serious
as it might appear. The nominees will have a little
fun and a little notoriety and the rest of the State
won't mind cither. There are some amenities even
in the lives of the minority in American politics.
AFTER the meeting of the business men of the

We hear r.j complaints about our street rail
road service. The fare is as low as elsewhere in
the United States, as well as in Glasgow when
you compare the wages in the two cities. There
is no pretense that a railroad is to be constructed
where now none exists. The city is not so
rich that it can afford to throw away $700,000.
We have not so many schools, hospitals, parks,
nor are our sewers and streets so perfect that we
ki\Qw not how to spend our income except in
rnaking experiments for which there is no public
demand. ,
The common sense, the business sense, the
horse sense of the people of the United States has
so far in the main kept them from wasting their
money and jeopardizing their prosperity by un
dertaking socialistic experiments. We advise the
people of this city to vote against trying this ex
periment.
It is good policy to make haste slowly. Beau
tify the city, make its streets smooth and clean,
its sewers the means of preserving health andjiot
of fostering disease, its schoolhouses safe and spa
cious, because these are all civic necessities. Do
not waste your money or your officials' time and
labor in trying to anticipate what is now neither
a civic nor a private necessity, but admittedly a
doubtful and most certainly, a dangerous experi-
But^why try this experiment?
WHY "Try the Experiment?"
The only answer so far made to the
, many arguments against the municipal
ownership of the Geary-street road is, "Try the
experiment." If it be urged that the official fig
ures show that the city will lose $40,000 a year,
the reply is, "Suppose that it be true* try the ex
periment." If it be shown that the Â¦ city, officials,
and especially the Board of VPubKc.AVorks, will
have probably more work than they can perform
in constructing the new improvements and main
taining the old ones, the only reply' is, "Concede
that be true, try the experiment. If* , it be ad
vanced that no city in the United States has yet
attempted to operate a street railroad, and that
those American cities that have operated any pub
lic utilities have failed, the only reply is, "Admit
such to be the case, try the experiment."
If Charles Francis Adams be quoted as saying,
"t'lease don't talk to me of doing business
through government machinery; it is one colos
sal exhibition of waste, extravagance and incom
petence," the only reply is, "What if he be cor
rect? Try the experiment." If it be proven that
under the charter the road could not be sold or
leased, and that the victims of the city's negli
gence in the operation of its cars will have
against the city no redress for their injuries,
the only reply is, "What matters all that? Try the
'experiment."
If it be made clear that the acquisition of this
road will be the entering wedge of socialism, that
there is no more dangerous enemy to American
prosperity than socialism, that socialism is the re
source of the incompetent and a dead weight
around the necks of the competent, that as' one
drop of ink will discolor a bucket of water so a
small socialistic beginning will affect the whole
fabric of government, the only reply is, "Try the
experiment."

The would-be assassin who sought to reach the
President on Monday, and who seriously wounded
two of the White House guards, is the material that
;$ fired by the malignity that is in such newspaper
abuse as led to the murder of McKinley. For a long
time after that great crime the journals which in
cited it were quiet. Now, trusting to the short mem
ory of the people, they are again in open use of the
resources of publicity to direct the spirit of murder
agrainst the life of the President. It is useless to put
in irons or cells the dupes of such newspapers while
leaving them to feel that public sentiment docs not
condemn the means they use.
These attacks arc peculiar in being an expression
of personal malice and in being always, with great
cunning and surpassing ingenuity, planned to rouse
malignant personal feeling against the President.
They arc not criticisms of policy at all. They per
sistently represent the President as personally doing
harm to something or somebody, as indifferent to
the interests of others, and as capable of cold cruelty
and wTongdoing. They arc works of art in delib
erate misrepresentation, and if they have any pur
pose at all it is to invite bitter and vengeful feelings
against the person of the President.
Xo wise American objects to proper criticism of
public men. Within well understood limitations it
is a wholesome and fe restraining influence. When
called for it is a legal and proper assertion of the
rights of free speech and of a free press. Such criti
cism is not an incitement to crime. It does not sug
gest, to criminal and distorted minds, assassination
as a remedy for anything, but keeps before the people
the ballot-box as the place to begin reforms or to
overthrow policies and jmt other, and better in their
place.
The Hearst style of attack is not criticism. It
never reasons. It avoids facts. It distorts and de
forms, and suggests things for which murder occurs
as the only remedy to the class of minds to which
ijt appeals. Experience has proved that we do not
lack the kind of pe(tple who need <^ily such incite
ment to become assassins. The last attempt on the
life of President Roosevelt was made by a man char
itably said to be crazy. But in his home he is known
a? an anarchist, a violent declaimer against govern
ment and a firm believer in the theory that all who
represent government are the -corrupt oppressors of
the people.
He is insane, perhaps, in the sense in which insan
ity and the power to reason never exist together.
We say of an insane man that "he has lost his rea
son" without always thinking what we mean. There
arc men incapable of reasoning who arc not classed
35 insane. But they are a dangerous class. They are
directly appealed to by the artistically cunning and
fearfully unscrupulous style of attack made on the
President. Such attacks put him in continual peril,
and justify him in carrying weapons to be used in de
fending himself. Yet the fact that he is armed and
prepared to sell his life as dearly as possible has been
made the cause of sinister suggestion, in cartoons and
text, that appeals powerfully to the vicious and non
reasoning-
IT is not forgotten that the assassination of Presi
dent McKinley followed long maintained and
embittered personal abuse oi him by the oppo
sition press and that the leader in this abuse was
Mr. William Randolph Hearst, through his several
newspapers. The same papers have, for nearly a
year now, been making the same kind of attacks on
President Roosevelt.

Dear Sirs and Brothers: The second Sun
day In October, which falls this year upon the

should be necessary to Impress upon the mem
bers of our fraternity the duty which we. the
living, owe to our dead. Wherever there Is a
parlor of the Native Sons of the Golden West
let its members and friend* on that day
gather within lodgeroom or public hall to hold
such services as will manifest the love ana
reverence which we bear for the memory of
the departed, and let us turn for a few hours
with poftened hearts from the pleasures and
the cares of life to drop the gentle tear of
recollection at the grave of our brother and
weave a Kariand of flowers for his tomb.
We love to think of our fraternity as one
whose tender solicitude for Its members ends
not when the Brave closes over them, but leads
us with words of consolation to the stricken
fireside and knits the mystic cords of memory
that bind the living to every act of virtue
and of gentlenefs that in life characterized the

Grand President McNoble Issues
Circular Letter to the Various
Parlors of State.
George A. Denison, after receiving many
compliments at the hands of the board,
was elected assistant secretary. Luther
Burbank promised to assist in making a
collection of the varieties of fruits and
vegetables to which he has given origin.
The board will visit his home at Santa
Rosa at the -proper time. Resolutions
were adopted in respect to the memory
of Elizabeth Shields, who was long a
member of the board.
It was voted to entertain the American
Bankers' Association one day at the board
rooms during the visit of the bankers
this month.
"NV. H. Mills told of a pamphlet that
had been issued by British Consul Ben
nett, in which attention was called to the
fact that there had been a falling off in
the shipments of California canned goods
to England. A California fruit shipper
went to I_ondon and arrived ahead of his
goods and paw them set aside as "blown,"
or "blowed." as they were described In
England. He demonstrated that the goods
were all right and every case was then
restored and was found to be marketable.
After these somewhat startling revela
tions concerning the various methods em
ployed to rob the California fruit grower
had been made, the Mills resolution for
an Inquiry' went' through with a rush.
The committee to see the Merchants'
Association relative to having a special
exhibit at St. Louis representative of the
commercial and other advantages of San
Francisco made a report through "\V. H.
Mills. The plan suggested by the Mer
chants' Association was to have a com
mittee of fifty members, embracing ten
representatives from each of the commer
cial organizations of San Francisco, this
committee to appoint an executive com
mittee of ten members to see that San
Francisco was represented. I^os Angeles.
Seattle and Eastern cities havq arranged
to have their advantages thoroughly ad
vertised nt St. Louis.
Colonel John P. Irish said that in Pla
cer County his neighbors had told him
of their troubles at the hands of the com
mission men. Fruit that passed exami
nation at the platform at the station was
paid for by check: fruit that failed to
passed the examination went out on a
commission basis. At the beginning of
the season his neighbors were happy. At
the end of the season he found that they
were much depressed. In some instances
the fruit growers were represented as in
debt to the commission men and the lat
ter were, actually pressing them for crop
mortgages on the crop of the ensuing
'year.'- to make up the difference. On in
vestigation Colonel Irish discovered that
the commission men had charged the
growers- broken carload rates of ; freight,
whereas tha cars went out full and the
commission men really had paid only the
carload rate, or about a half what they
had charged In making up their returns
to the California fruit growers. The dif
ference on the freights alone would have
given to the producers a profit. Colonel
Irish also related a personal experience
in tho East, where he traced fruit that
he had shipped. He found out to a cer
tainty that the prices patd by the retail
dealers and the prices returned by the
commission men as having been paid by
retailers were far apart.
FRAUDS IN KNGLAJND.
C. M. Wooster related something con
cerning his personal observations in Chi
cago. Twenty-two Armenians, three
Italians and one person concerning whose
nationality he was In doubt were the only
bidders on two carloads of California
fruit that he saw. Every box of fruit
that was found to be Injured was dis
played as a sample; every box of good
fruit was put under the other boxes and
kept out of sight. There was an evident
understanding among those present. The
buyers did not bid against one another.
He Inquired If this was the customary way
of selling California fruit in Chicago and
was answered In the affirmative. He saw
pears that would sell for $150 per box
easily in San Francisco going for 75 cents
per box, under this system, in Chicago.
Mr. Mills suggested that an agent be
sent to Chicago and New York to see
exactly how California goods are handled.
He had heard that the method had been
pursued in Chicago, In reference to green
pears, for instance, of putting out for
samples only the fruit that had been
damaged. The car price of the carload
was fixed in this way very low and the
Eastern men got the fruit for their own
price. "Was that true? Was such the
practice? -Had the marketing of the great
California fruit output been conducted
In that way?" Mr. Mills asked.
WOOSTER SEES SALE.
A resolution was adopted by the State
Board of Trade yesterday Instructing the
manager of the board to inquire and re
port concerning the practicability of in
stituting a general Inquiry into the fruit
market, foreign and domestic, with ref
erence to the ascertainment of all the
facts relating to such market, and es
pecially with reference to the amount re
turned from the reported sales of fruit
and the actual amount obtained from
such sales, to the end that the price paid
to the fruit grower of this State shall
more nearly correspond to the price at
which the fruit reaches the consumer.
The manager was requested to report to
the board at its next meeting the practic
ability and cost of such inquiry.
This resolution was Introduced by W.
H. Mills. During the discussion that pre
ceded its adoption many statements were
made, all tending to show that the fruit
growers of California have been subjected
to the grossest frauds on the part of
Eastern fruit auction men, commission
men and dealers in fruit in Europe.
President N. P. Chlpman said that the
reports of American Consuls abroad,
made in September fast, show that the
market prices for French prunes at Bor
deaux range from 6 to 14 cents per pound
and the prices quoted in California for the
corresponding quality of fruit grown in
California arc not more than one-third
of the rates In France. Every year deal
ers sell short at low prices In New York,
unjusrly making a low figure for Cali
fornia prunes for the purpose of holding
down the price as against the producer.
Considering the fact that California an
nually ships out about 160,000.000 pound3
of dried fruit this is a serious matter.

The Board of Election Commissioners
yesterday completed the official count of
tfie votes cast at the recent bond election
for the construction ot public improve
ments. The corrected figures showed some
changes, but not sufficient to affect the
original result. The revised figures for
the Telegraph Hill project are ;7,932 for
and 81S7 against, and. though showing an
increase in favor of the proposition of
142 votes, still it failed to receive 18,203
votes, or two-thirds of 27.S08, the total
number of electors voting at the special
election, as required by a charter amend
ment. The supportera of the project claim
that It received more than two-thirds of.
the vote cast for It in particular and on
that account has carried.
The Election Commission transmitted
the returns to the Board of Supervisors,
who will in all likelihood ask advice from
the City Attorney as to whether the TeIe 
graph Hill project received the required
number of votes. The St. Mary's Square
and Twin Peaks projects were defeated.
The following Is the corrected count:
The trustees of the State Minlns Bu
reau arrived at a decision yesetrday that
will prove to be of importance to several
counties individually and to the mining
interests of the State as a whole. Tnia
was to resume field work at once, pre
paratory to getting together the data
necessary for the issuance of new regis
ters and maps. This work was suspended
some months ago under the former board
of trustees and. as one unexpected result,
several thousand dollars that had been
appropriated for the State Mining Bu
reau had to be covered back into tho
State treasury. This was not the only
serious feature of the case. Counties that
were at a disadvantage as compared to
others by reason of being " nable . l Â° Â»""
sent to incuirere official data relative to
their resources were the sufferers.
The situation has been made plala to
the new board o! trustees and they took
prompt action yesterday. It was re
solved to send the field men into Mart
posa County first. Every mine and every
mining claim in that county, together
with facts concerning each mine and
claim, will figure on the map and register
to be prepared. Every road and trail will
be depicted carefully. The map and reg
ister together will form a key to the
whole county, geographically and miner
ally.
In addition to providing for the field
work for the benefit of the counties. It
was determined to have a bulletin pre
pared relative .to the uses of California
petroleum and its fuel value and also to
devote attention to collecting information
concerning the structural materials pro
duced from quarries, clays, etc.. in Cal
ifornia The miners will be- requested by
the trustees to assist the bureau In pre
paring a representative exhibit of Cali
fornia's mining resources to be sent to the
St. Louis exposition.
The gentleman who prescribed public ownership
here as a remedy for "branded souls" is a physician,
and would be forbidden by professional ethics to
practice in medicine the quackery he practices in
politics. When the city administration has reached
ultimate efficiency in discharging the essential du
ties of government it will be time to consider the
policy of charging it with the responsibility of run
ning a business. Speakers who impeach govern
ment of neglect or corruption in the discharge of
its purely political functions and want to give it
more to do before it does well what it already has
are so illogical as to deserve censure.
The example of municipal trading, as public
ownership is called in England, was cited and is being
used by the newspapers in this city which want to
increase taxes by making the Geary-street road bonds
a lien on the taxpayers. Mr. Robert P. Porter, who
has investigated public ownership in Great Britain,
says: '"It is very tiresome for the British taxpayer
to hear so much about the profits of municipal
ownership when throughout the kingdom year after
year surely and steadily the municipal tax rate is in
creasing. This increase between 1875 and 1900 was
112 per cent."
The London Times has exhaustively and expertly
examined municipal ownership in Great Britain, and
declares that it has been instituted and is being used
by the socialists as a stepping-stone to "collectiv
ism." Toward this end the British socialists are
working. Their allies are the well-meaning people
who, having no plans of their own, follow the lead
of those who are working a well planned scheme.
The Times adds that, once create large municipal
staffs, bring together large bodies of men accustomed
to light work and to fixing their own compensation at
the expense of the taxpayer, put down plants and
erect buildings and purchase land; create vested in
terests with subtle ramifications, and it will not be
possible without heroic measures to rectify a series
of mistakes. And, gravest uncertainty of all, there
1 is a question whether the purity, such as it is, of mu
nicipal government will be maintained if it exercises
a multitude of duties, touches finance at many points
and makes politics and business almost synonymous.
Great Britain has been going into public owner
ship for a quarter of a century, and these deliberate
conclusions as to results are of weight now.
TiHE widely advertised meeting to promote the
burdening of the taxpayers with the purchase
and administration of the Geary-street road did
not reach the proportions promised in the advertise
ment Attendance was meager and the platform did
not groan under the weight of the vice presidents.
The speakers dwelt upon the ills we have, as they
see them, and boldly proposed that we fly to others
that we know not of.
The City Engineer filed a letter of estimates,
amending and contradicting his official figures, and
one gentleman made a speech compact of humor and
impassioned appeal, demanding public ownership of
the road because one time, while riding on the cars,
he swallowed a nickel which he had put in his mouth
to pay fare. We may be permitted to diverge for a
moment to be spent in advising that gentleman not
to make a purse of his mouth. It is the age of germs
and microbes, and whole colonies of these pernicious
forms inhabit nickels. It is a dirty and dangerous
practice to store money in the mouth. His position
seems to have been that it will be safe to do so under
public ownership of railroads. If this needed a de
nial we would deny it vehemently. There is nothing
in the charter which makes it the duty of the city
government to scrub and scour and disinfect nickels
in order that they may be safely concealed in the
oral cavity. It is a nasty habit.
Other speakers proceeded to violently despair of
the republic unless the whole city is taxed to build a
railroad for a small portion of the taxpayers, but
even this melancholy prospect failed to produce the
exasperated enthusiasm of the audience.\ No one ex
plained why it is necessary to put a lien on the whole
city in order to let the politicians run a street rail
road that is running already, carrying everybody that
wants to use it, and charging for the service the
same rate that the politicians will charge. If the
proposition were to build a new road where none
exists, as a convenience to people who have not
already such a facility, and the bonds were to be
placed entirely on the new plant and not made a lien
on the city, there would be in it an element of busi
ness sense that would deserve a degree of respect.
The president of the -meeting said that public ser
vants were the tools of corporations, who "betrayed
the city and branded their souls"; he even intimated
that they were like unto Judas, and raised his voice
to a great altitude in asking for a remedy "for the
deplorable state of affairs in our city," and in an
swering his question by prescribing public ownership
of public utilities. He did not take the pains to ex
plain how the medicine would work. The evidence
seems to be beyond dispute that where public owner
ship is tried it alone produces no betterment in pub
lic administration. New York City has owned her
water works for nearly a century, and Tammany has
run the city most of the time and made its admin
tration so noisome that carrion-eating buzzards fly
away to the garbage pile for fresh air. Philadelphia
for years owned and ran water and gas works, and
the public administration has been so corrupt as often
to make Tammany ashamed of its moderation.

business men resolved to get full value for all money
expended and to pay fair and good wages for all work
done.
Congressman Kahn presented the subject in his
opening address in the emphatic words: "The people
of this city are interested in seeing these improve
ments properly executed. They wish the money they
have voted for public improvements put into public
improvements. They wish to know that the various
commissions that will have these moneys to expend
will expend them, honestly for the desired improve
ments." v
Other speakers at the meeting followed the lines
laid down by the opening address and gave renewed
evidence of the earnestness of the people on that
score. It was therefore with profound satisfaction
that the pledge of Mr. Crocker to give the city an
efficient, businesslike administration was heard.
That pledge constitutes the keynote of the campaign.
Mr. Crocker said: "I pledge myself that if elected
I will be the Mayor of all the people of San Fran
cisco. When I came in this evening from the out
lying district that is proud to be called the boundary
of San Francisco I could see that the desire of the
people is that the money they have voted shall be
honestly spent. I don't mean to say that I can di
rect that work any better than any one else, but I
surely want to be elected Mayor of San Francisco,
and if I am I can say here that if it comes within
my province to say ho\vÂ£this money shall be spent,
the workingmen of San Francisco shall receive every
dollar they are entitled to. But I shall take as much
pains to see that the taxpayers and the people who
have voted this enormous sum for the improvement
of greater San Francisco shall receive every particle
of result from that labor."
No better pledge on this issue of so much impor
tance to the people can be asked for or given. It
is, moreover, a pledge of some value, since it comes
from a business man' of first-class -ability and of
sound honor. The thing that Henry J. Crocker
promises is the thing that ho will do. Men
of business have been counting on him in
great enterprises for years and have always
found him true to his word, and now the people
can count on him in politics. That they will ac
cept him and his colleagues on the strength of these
businesslike pledges and assurances of good govern
ment will be made evident at the ratification meetinjr
on Saturday. It will be something more than a* par
tisan affair, and will make a new record in the way
of popular demonstrations in San Francisco politics.
THE GEARY STREET ROAD.
THE SAN FRANCISCO" CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1903.
The socialists of Vienna have unloosed their
tongues, made discordant their voices and afflicted
the air with wild abuse of the Czar of Russia. What
license a national dividing line gives to cowards.
How many arc the patriots whose tongues wag thou
sands of miles from the scene of danger or the place
where protest should be made. There are a few such
patriots in the United States.
, Some surprise has been expressed that the pro
gressive citizens of Oakland' have organized them
selves in an aggressive movement for "cleanest Oak
land." We all thought that Oakland, being godly,
necessarily is cleanly, and a new movement in either
direction would be as if striving to paint the lily.
We are sorry that San Francisco, either in theory or
practice, cannot offer a valuable positive suggestion
to the new crusaders. We might, however, pose as
a horrible exariiple.

Besides owing large sums to the Hllbert
Mercantile Company and the California
Wine and Brandy Company, both of this
city, Campbell contracted enough
debts to bring the sum total of his lia
bilities up to the $3000 mark. "When
Thompson discovered the true state of af
fairs a little rriore than two weeks ago,
he promptly dissolved his partnership
with Campbell. On September 19 Camp
bell hastily departed for New â¢ York,
where, it is said, he has been endeavor
ing to raise the amount of his deficiencies.
Yesterday Attorney William H.
Schooler, who has undertaken to ne
gotiate between Campbell and his
creditors, received a telegram from
George D. Mechem, a broker of New
York, stating that Campbell was in a fair
way to raise the necessary cash. Thomp
son has little sympathy for his former
partner. He said yesterday:
According to the claims of Attorney
Charles Thompson, the old story of wine,
women and song has been repeated In the
Instance of Arthur L. Campbell, his erst
while friend and business partner. While
he himself was attending to the business
of the legal firm In Alaska, Thompson
asserts that Campbell squandered the as
sets of the firm wlth'a wild abandon until
now he Is back in New York endeavoring
to raise $3000 to prevent himself from
being caught In the toils of the law.
After several months' stay In the North,
Thompson returned a short time ago to
find the business of the firm hopelessly
entangled and Campbell, his partner,
beset by an army of creditors who threat
ened to have the law on him if he did
not settle forthwith. It Is alleged that
while conducting the collection business
of the firm, Campbell failed in many in
stances to turn over to the firms for
which he was acting agent the funds
he had procured.
George T. Mcl>onnell, alias Rev. J. B.
Taylor of Emeryville, alias II. Epstein,
appeared before United States Court
Commissioner Heacock yesterday fur
iucnlii'cation and his ball was fixed at
$1000. In default of a bond ho was sent
to the Alanuda Jail.
The complaint on which McDonnell was
arrested was sworn to by Poatofflce In
spector James O'Connell. He charges
that McDonnell used the mails for the
purpose of defrauding- Clay A. Straley. a
barber doing business at Cottonwood,
and C. G. Pope of the Palace Barber Shop
at Alturnrt, and many others. In work-
Ing his (scheme McDonnell sent duplicates
of the following letter to all his victims:
EMERYVILLE, Cal., July 20, 1003.â Mr. C.
O. â¢ Pooe â Dear Sir: The inclosed pawn ticket
is sent to you by way of restitution. The
sender is at the point of death as the result
of an accident. He wishes mft to sav that hÂ«
once stole some money from you which he is
unable to return, but that the difference be
tween the valua of the locket and the amount
it is pledged (or is considerably more than
the sum stolen. He hopes that you will be
able in this way to reimburse yourself. Yours
very truly, J. B. TATLOR,
Pastor Church of the Redeemed.
There is no Pastor J. B. Tarlor at
Emeryville and no Church of the Re
deemed. The two barbers named had
no recollection of having bean plun
dered by any one and turned over
the letters to the postofflce authori
ties, who detailed Postofflce Inspector
James O'Connell to work on the case.
The Inspector found several victims who
had each sent H2 50 to redeem the dia
mond locket and In return each had been
sent by McDonnell a gilt locket with an
Imitation diamond.
McDonnell's examination was set for
October 31.
Assistant City Engineer Morser says
that the cue Is being taken from the good
results obtained in the oiling of the drive
ways in Golden Gate Park. He says the
pavement is probably the best that can
be used where the value of the property
does not warrant any great outlay. The
treatment with oil results in the forming
of a sort of bituminous rock payment,
which, with ordinary care, will last for
a long period.
gations I discovered the true state of
affairs. Campbell was in serious danger
of going to jail. I learned that all the
money he could not account for went over
the bar for liquor or was spent In quiet
little times with a fair young stenog
rapher.
The expense of the proposed improve
ment will lie entirely with the owners of
property fronting on the streets It Is pro
posed to oil. The only interest the city
has In the matter is the Issuance of a
permit for the work.
As the contracts now read they bind
the firm of De Camp & Moosher to fur
nish the required amount of petroleum
on the streets, some of which have been
macadamized for the purpose of convert-
Ing them Into smooth roads. They arÂ© to
be maintained by the firm for a period
of three years, after .which time they will
require little or no attention.
Property owners have already applied
to the Board of Public Works for the oil
ing of Point Lobos avenue, ajid It is be
lieved that this thoroughfare will be oiled
to Twelfth avenue. Some of the other
avenues in the Richmond district will also
be treated with, oil, together with the
streets in the Sunset district which will
warrant the improvement. I
therein.
Property owners In the Richmond and
Sunset districts axe preparing to enter
Into contracts for the oiling of certain
streets in their localities. The contracts
are being prepared and have been sub
mitted to City Engineer Gfunsky for his
opinion as to the specifications contained

The best bout of the evening was fur
nished by Barney Driscoll and Fred Ten
ny. Driscoll received the decision, but It
was dangerously close, and for that rea
son many were far from being pleased.
Both boys began to flght at the outset
and never for a moment did they slacken
their speed.
Driscoll was literally cut to ribbons, but
showed be was game. He never let up
and finally be began to use his left to
advantage. Tenny rushed his opponent
most of the time and fought a great bat
tle. Drlscoll's cleverness was all that
saved him from belnc knocked out on
many occasions. When he was awarded
the palm of victory it came as a surprise
to many ( of the spectators.
Pete SUlllvan knocked out Jack Adams
in the third round of a flght that was
a wonder. 50th men were all but fin
ished many times, yet they went to It
and fought for the sake of fighting. J.
St. Clair finished Jim McCann in two
rounds with a good wallop to the Jaw.
Joe Kelly put "William Hampshire to the
carpet in the first round, and Joe Nlde
rost secured the decision over Jim Leary.
The fight proved that Flnnlgan Is the
best boxer In his class to be found within
many miles of this city. He was cool
and coUrrtod every minute of the time
and had the clever Kehoe at bis mercy
from the tap of the gong. Flnnlgan be
gan to punish his man badly In the sec
ond round, so the' seconds of the latter
threw up the sponge to save their charge
from an unnecessary beatinsr.
The first national championship boxing
tournament under the auspices of the
Pacific Athletic Association brought out
a. number of likely boys last night and
save tho large gathering a chance to
cheer for fighting that was fast and fu
rious and savored of the strenuous stuff.
In the main event George Flnnlgan, the
bantam from the Olympic Club, easily
outclassed Ed Kehoe and won In the sec
ond round. Eddie Graney refereed all the
bouts.

Since he left the employ of the "Whit
ney stable Tommy Burns Is knuckling
down to hard work and the form chart
shows a vast improvement In his riding.
M. D. Miller, who has put in a success
ful season booking on the Chicago tracks,
will race a good stable out here the com
ing season.
Willie Buchanan, the Oakland boy who
is riding for Barney Schrelber at Chi
cago, is apt to be one of the stars thla
winter at Oakland and Ingleside. "Buck"
got into a peck of trouble with the stew
ards down at New Orleans last winter,
but is in good standing now, and says ha
intends to stay there.
At the close of the Spokane, Wash.,
meeting Billy Randall will ship his string
of five horses to Oakland.
Frank McMahon will race his recent
Eastern purchase, Oronte, at Spokane.
Sad Sam is there, too, and the pair ought
to furnish quite a contest.
"Virginia" Carroll, whose stock of re
partee exceeded the demand out this way,
has been booking most of the summer at
St. Louis for Max Gumpertz. Carroll la
a clever layer of odds and at last ac
counts was $12,000 to the good. He has
purchased a residence in St. Louis and
intends to make that city his home. If
everythlng^goea Â¦well with the new track
at Hot Springs. Ark., Carroll may hang
out his shingle there.
Grover Cleveland Full-er, the crack
rider of the far East at tire age of IS.
appears to have acquired a dry thirst that
a garden hose cannot keep wet down. One
day last week at one of the New YorS
tracks Fuller landed in the jockey-room
with an unlabeled load, that the clerk of
the scales refused to weigh. He gives
every indication of a young man destined
to stray from the path followed by his
illustrious namesake, the- ex-President.
The stewards have his case before them.
The exodus of horsemen to California
has commenced. Emil Herz wired Secre
tary Treat of the California Jockey Club
for eight stalls. His horses were shipped
from Chicago on Monday. Herz waa
formerly a partner of "Boots" Durnell,
which firm dissolved partnership some
months ago, owing to a disagreement
over gambling operations. Durnell and
Herz raced their horses at New Orleans
last winter, and had the star performer
there in the great McChesney.
Another owner with an eye out for
some of the early money la that of Franlc
Phllllpa. The genial Frank's stable left
Chicago for Oakland last Saturday ia
charge of Alec Forbes. Beau Ormonde,
owned by Ed Kiipp of Sacramento, is
a member of the string.
Dr. Rowell has by no means forsaken
the tracks at this end of the line. The
doctor made some stake entries at L03
Angeles, but wired Secretary Treat yes
terday to # reserve his old stalls, as he
would be 'here shortly with a stable of
thirteen.
Dick Havey, who will fulfill the duties
of starter at the L03 Angeles meeting,
which begins on Saturday next, leaves for
the Southern city on Thursday night.
Martin Nathanson will not come to
California this winter. The sterling sec
retary of Harlem track. Chicago, finds
his duties at home so multifarious that
he cannot undertake the trip.
"When a selling plater of the stripe oÂ£
The Fiddler, who could not win a race
at the Petaluma meeting, can be taken to
one of the New York tracks and be made
the medium of a big coup, it only goes
to demonstrate that California possesses
a better class of horses than some of tho
critics give the coast credit for having.
Perhaps on the other side of the hilla tha
owners of The Fiddler found a new
brand of resin, or else this latest Fiddler
may have bÂ«en a promising pupil of the
California horse.

James W. Erwin was tendered a testi
monial entertainment at the Alhambra
Theater last night by the California Cam
era Club, of which he has been president
and an honored member for years. The
reception accorded Mr. Erwin was such
as is seldom witnessed In this or any city.
When he came out upon the stage to tell
in twenty minutes of picturesque, Cali
fornia with the assistance of re
markable pictures of the State's
incomparable scenery, the friends
that packed the theater from gallery to
floor burst into a volley of applause
which it seemed would never end. Again
and again Mr. Erwin, who was deeply
touched with the expression of regard,
bowed his acknowledgement and again
and again the fervor of the applause and
cheers Increased.

CHICAGO, Oct. 6.-The racing at Worth
to-day was of the "oTSinary kind. Cheap
horses made up the field and the only
redeeming feature was the victory of
three favorites and two well played sec
ond choices.
The purse affair at five furlongs was
easy for Delagoa, the odds-on favorite.
When the barrier was lifted in the third
race Lady Jocelyn, heavily played at 13
to 10, was knocked to her knees and her
chances of winning was ruined right
there. Jockey Phillips rated her along
nicely to the stretch and from there on
came like a wild horse, but third was the
best she could do.
The weather was cloudy and threaten

crowd only fair. Summary:

He raised it far out to the left field
fence and It kept breaking away from
Ross all the time. While the little fielder
was hot footing after the leather. Meany
and Shay reached home. Then Pabst
chopped a nasty one to Toman. While
the runner was being fielded out at first
base, Krug registered.
Shay opened the game by working Hall
for a pass. Meany chopped one down
that was too hot for Hall to handle.
Leahy advanced them both with a bunt.
Then Germany Krug camÂ© through with
the first timely hit ho has made for six
months.
It takes a southpaw to stop that Angel
band of ball tossers. They have been hit
ting right-handed pitchers to a fare-ye
well during the past week, but yesterday,
when they faced Pewee Llndsey on the
Oakland grounds, they did not have a
chance. He commenced to buffalo them
in the first Inning and they never re
covered from the shock. Score, 3 to 0.
Hall got In wrong during the first In
ning and the home tossers fell on his
offerings at once. They made all their
runs at this time and, In fact, all the
playing was done in the initial Inning.
After that the game was slow and no one
seemed to care how It ended.

Â¦\Vaterboy, considered by many to be the
greatest race horse in training, probably
will never race again. Trainer Joyner
had been putting him under special prep
arations for the $10,000 Brighton Cup
race, which would have wound up his
campaign for this season, but two days
ago Waterboy developed lameness and
everything was declared off. Joyner
said to-day that It would be impossible to
train Waterboy any more this year and
that while an attempt would be made to
fit him for the races next season it was
doubtful whether he would ever be able
to go to the post again.
Although the stewards gave out no
special verdict, it was stated to-night
from an authoritative source that there
would bÂ© no further developments in The
Fiddler case, and that T. T. Cromwell
would be allowed to enter his gelding In
future events at the Metropolitan tracks.
There was a rumor afloat early in the day
that gome new evidence In the case was
on the way from St. Louis, but it did not
materialize. The stewards have con
ducted a searching investigation and feel
confident, it Is said, that there was noth
ing wrong with The Fiddler's race on
Saturday.

Metzinger to Serve a Year.
Andrew Metzingrer was held to answer
last Saturday by Police Judge Mogan
on charges of burglary and grand lar
ceny, but as it was shown to the Judge
yesterday that Metzinger had previously
borne a good character and that his wife
was a very sick woman, he reduced the
charges to petty larceny and sentenced
Mrtzinger to serve six months in the
county jail on each charge. He was ac
cused of stealing a trunk from Mrs. Nora
McNamlra and a bicycle from Alfred W.
Tuttle.

Quick and decisive work marked the
trials in the tug of war tournament at
Central Park last night. Enthusiasm was
none the less intense, however, for each
team had its host of admirers that
Bhouted words of encouragement to its
favorite until the pistol shot that^ ended
the trial was sounded.
The teamsters, after a hard pull that
lasted five and a half minutes, forced the
cement workers to succumb to their
greater strength. The horseshoers gave
In to the laborers after a two-minute
and twenty-second struggle.
It took the carmen a few seconds more
than eight minutes to drag the plumbers
over the winning line, after a trial that
teemed with excitement.
The final contest of the evening was
between the plasterers and the longshore
lumberman. The men from the docks
dallied with their lighter opponents for
two minutes and then, with a steady pull,
got them over the tape in rush fashion.
The card for to-night will be: Laborers
vs. bricklayers, carpenters vs. bridgemen.
cement-workers vs. carmen, plasterers vs.
horseshoers, teamsters vs. plumbers. [

Love, Honor and ? Obey.
A FEW days ajro a famous and stunning beauty abruptly termina-
ted her own weddincr ceremony by refusing to reoeat the word
"Obey" after the officiating clergyman. In consequence she
is still unmarried and her action has set the East by the ears. In
the discussion pro and con (and it is truly remarkable what stand
the women have taken) Father John Talbot Smith of the Catholic
church was appealed to. He has given his dictum in no uncertain words.
"To tell the truth." he said. "I do not think it is a practical ques-
tion at all.* this one of eliminatine the word obey. It is in the nature of
things that the man should command and woman should obev. no mat-
ter how many statutory provisions you make, simply because a man likes
to command and a woman likes to obey.
"What is the use of statutes against a natural proclivity or condition?
You can see the wisdom of the church in omitting this word from its
ritual.
"A woman who refuses to obey might please her fancy by the mere
declination to follow a custom, yet she might be the quickest to obey
her husband.
"That is where nature is stronger than ideas. Ideas may become
fads, existing f.r a short while, but nature goes right on.
"I notice that men are glad to get the women they want to marry
and the women are equally glad to marry, obey cr not, regardless of all
fads and fancies."
There are so many who differ with the reverend father that what
they have to say forms one of the most interesting pages in the next
Sunday CalL * ..Â¦;
It is almost that very same quality of "circumstance that forms the
theme of Robert Barr's great romantic story, "The King Investigates,"
and by perhaps a strange coincidence the problem is -solved in a novel
way in the fourth and last installment of E. W. Townsend's latest and
best novel, "Lees and Leaven." which will appear next Sunday. The
famous creator of "Chimmie Fadden" has made a big seraition since ap-
pearing as a writer in the Sunday Call. T
Then there is a page of "Half-Hour Storiettes," which treats the
problem from quite a different point of view. There you have four of
the cleverest and most touching romances ever written. "The Voice and
the Violin" especially and "The Grammar of Love"_ as well, wbich is a
story that you will never forget. jr
Then there is one of Frank H. Spearman's wonderful . two-page
railroad stories, "De Molav Four," which, if you read it (and of course
you will), will constantly recur to your mind with a stranjre thrill every
time you see the moon. \Vhy? Because Frank H. Spearman wrote it,
and the moon wouldn't be in it if it were not dramatic.
And now harken to a few other special features, which can only be
mentioned in brief because there are so many good things in the next
Sunday Call.
First, the "Me-ows of a Kitty" (are you watching those cats?);
the fourth talk to parents on the "Punishment Â«.f Children." which will
explain to you some of the reasons why you were. whipped when you
did not deserve it. when vou were young, and why you were not thrashed
when you did deserve it: "The Effect of Imperialism on National Charac- V
ter," by Dr.- Richard Garnett. C. B.; "The Etiquette of the Automobile,"
by Madge Moore: "Recollections and Reflections," by Thomas Fitch,
which will tell you thinzs about the Bonanza Kings of the West that you
didn't know before, and." oh. ever so many things besides.
Just watch for the pictures. -:â¢â¢ ' j'^7

ionable people, who carefully inspected
the products of the local artists" pencils
and brushes and bestowed much praise
upon the elaborate display, which is un
doubtedly the finest ever made In this
city. The sketches and paintings, stretch
ed upon the screens which extend around
the hall, represent the work of over fifty
well known local artists, who have united
in making the display as attractive as
possible in the matter of arrangement

until Saturday night, during which time
the public will be welcomed afternoon
and evening. The members of the league
are In attendance to afford their guests
every reasonable attention and they fur
nish the latter with an interesting as well
as elaborate catalogue. In which they

The trial of the suit for (10,000 against
the estate of the late Walter Morosco,
otherwise known as Bishop, circus tum
bler, impresario and capitalist, waa .begun
before Judge Melvin to-day. This amount
is asked by Willard Perry Crackles, a
youth to whom Morosco took a fancy and,
so Crackles claims, promised him if he
would live with him as a companion he
would provide for him and when he had
finished his education set him up in busi
ness. Morosco died a few months after
Crackles had gone to live with him with
out making any provision for Crackles,
who has now begun suit for a sufficient
sum to carry out the programme.
Crackles was 18 years of age when he
went to live with his benefactor. He was
in court to-day, but the trial of the case
had only proceeded a short time when a
legal point was raised by the attorney
tor Lewis H. Bishop, executor of the es
tate, and a hallbrother of the deceased,
who attacked the sutficiency of the
grounds upon which the complaint is
founded. The argument lasted until the

CARRIES WHISKY TO TTTR
FRIEND IN CITY PBISON
Charles B. Wayne Locked Up for Try
ing to Quench Thirst of James
Cook.
It has been ofttimes said that "a friend
in need is a friend Indeed," but James H.
Conk has no doubt learned that "a friend
in jail is of no avail." Whisky has caused
the downfall of many, but not in the
manner that Charles B. Wayne came to
prief.
It would bÂ« well to state in advance
that Wayne and Cook are friends and also
rainters. Cook was hustled to the City
Prison yesterday afternoon % tv an un
ryrr.pathetic minion of the law and
charred with the heinous offense of being
<3runk in a public place, a crime several
<JtETees greater than common drunk.
"Wayne, upon hearing of the plight of his
friend and believing that several jolts of
the distillate of yellow corn would dis
pel the lont-snmeness of the dungeon, pur
chased a flask and repaired to the prison.
Cook was called and fraternally gTeeted
his friend. After rome preliminary re
marks Wayne confided the fact that In
one cf his capacious pockets reposed a
flask cf the ctuff that cheers. Ccok was
overjoyed and was not long In securing
poj^s^ion of the flask. But they had
reckoned without their host. Ever-vie-
Ilant Turnkey Pete Fanning and General-
Ifslmo Burr Love had witnessed the
transaction, and they swooped down upon
the pair. Cook was returned to his cell
Wayne booked on a charge of brineine
liquor into the City Prison and the in-
Tiocort cause of the affair confiscated,
and Cook spent the right in the
fcastil*. "two souls with but a single
thought, two hearts that beat as one "
Entertainment and Dance.
The members of Company B, First
Regiment, League of the Cross Cadets,
have completed arrangements for an en
tertainment and dance to be given at
Mission Opera Hall on Mission street, be
tween Seventeenth and Eighteenth, on
Saturday evening, October 24, for the
benefit of the football team of the com
pany, popularly known as "the Cardinal
B's." The proceeds of the affair afe to
be devoted to the purchase of uniforms
and necessary equipment. The members
of the team are practicing with a vim and
expect to carry off one of the prizes of
the annual tournament.
Leg Broken WhilÂ© at Work.
Simon Murchison, while empfoyed yes
terday in making alterations in the curve
combination at the turn where the Hyde-
Btreet cara.turn from O'Farrell into Jones
street, met with a painful accident by
having his right leg broken by a leve,r
which was suddenly thrown out of place.
The Injured man was taken to the Emer
gency Hospital, where Dr. Bunnell set the
fractured leg. Later Murchison was re
moved to the McNutt Hospital at the or
der of the California Street Railroad
Company.
Caught Smuggling Opium.
OAKLAND. Oct. 6. â Lee Bang, a
Chinese who was detected in the act of
passing opium to a fellbw countryman
confined in the county Jail here, was held
for trial to-day by Justice of the Peace
Quinn. His 'ball* was fixed at $2000. The
opium had been cleverly concealed in
cigar wrappers, but waÂ» so h*avy that
the trick was detected. [ .
The anthropologists have long been
mystified by the great diversity of. Indian
languages in California, there being more
here than anywhere else in America.
The University of California and Eastern
institutions have been carrying on more
investigations of these languages during
the last five years than in all previous
time. These languages are rapidly dis
appearing and hardly a year goes by
without some special dialect or even lan
guage becoming extinct. In some cases
there are only five or six individuals re
maining to speak their tribal language.
It is to preserve these languages that
the university is training students to
carry on the research before the oppor
tunities pass awav.' .
The officers of the anthropological depart
ment make a special appeal to persons in all
parts or the State and adjacent regions for aid
In this survey. Hundreds of Indian objects
ar* found annually, which if carefully labeled
as to where and how found and sent to the
university, would, when brought together for
comparative Btudy. aid in the settlement of
many important questions. The distribution of
a particular kind of stone Implement or of an
ancient form of basket and of many other ob
jects of Indian manufacture (even the peculiar
stone of which an implement Is made is of
great importance), will aid in determining the
distribution of a tribe or group of which
other records may be lost or so uncertain that
Just confirmatory evidence to establish a par
ticular point Is required.
Information relating to the location of caves,
shellheape, old burial places, ancient village
sites and scattered fragments or survivors of
nearly extinct tribes is earnestly solicited, that
such may be investigated by the department
and may be correctly recorded on its ethno
logical and archaeological maps of the State.
Â¦ The university Is by this survey carrying on
a research of great importance in obtaining; a
knowledge of the first peopling of the Pacific
Coast and of the early migrations, and of the
relationships of the recent and present Indiana,
a research that Is required by anthropologists
and by all Interested in the early history of
man. This work has been well begun, byt as
sistance of many kinds is needed for its rapid
progress. This assistance, it is hoped, will be
given to aid the university of the State in an
undertaking of euch general Interest.
With the object of obtaining a complete
history of the aboriginal peoples and lan
guages of California the University of
California sent broadcast to-day a cir
cular that contains an appeal to all Cali
fornlans to aid in the survey of the State
for Indian relics, through which the an
thropologists may trace the history of the
prehistoric populace. The circular reads

INDIAN RELICS
GROW PRECIOUS
The old man was dumb about the case,
and he did not fulfill the prophecy of
Former Detective Fred Fuller that one
day he would confess. Congressman Vic
tor H. Metcalf was Jones' attorney at the
trial. The old man had a lingering hope
that in view of his condition the case
might be dismissed, bo many years having
elapsed. Borne time ago he asked that
the Congressman be requested to do some
thing in that direction. The aged pris
oner seemed to feel aq if he would like to
die out of prison. But there was no move
to be made.
Jones' body was turned over to under
takers to be prepared for burial. Tb.2 ex
pense will be borne by the county.
Jones had been falling for months. For
several weeks past his condition was no
ticeably worse. "Frank Hardle," the old
prisoner's attendant, heard him breathing
heavily this morning, but there was no
sign of approaching death. The old man
passed off as a child in gentle slumber.
Jones was arrested February 14, 1885,
for the murder of Dutil, which occuired
many weeks before that date. Dutil's
body, with the head crushed by a blow
from a brass beer keg faucet, was found
on the floor of his saloon at , Nineteenth
street and San Pablo avenue. The mur
derer had stolen Dutil's jewelry and
money from the saloon till, and a trail
of blood showed where he had escaped by
way of a back fence. ,
Weeks afterward George Jones, a lock
smith, was arrested at Seventh street and
Broadway for drunkenness. En route to
Jail Jones dropped pieces of jewelry, sub
sequently recovered and Identified as hav
ing belonged to Dutil. The police started
from that clew and weaved a chain of
circumstantial evidence around Jones that
caused his conviction.
He claimed that the Jewelry had been
sold to him by a young man, but the sus
picious action in his throwing away the
stolen property convinced the Jury, along
with much other evidence, that Jones waa
the murderer.
During the trial the jury was taken to
view Dutil's saloon. For some reason or
another Jones did not accompany the Jury
on its inspecting tour, and this oversight
was held to be sufficient to warrant the
granting of the new trial.
OAKLAND, Oct. 6.â George Jones, a
prisoner in the County Jail for
more than eighteen years, await
ing his second trial for the mur
der of Lorenzo Dutil, a San
Pablo-avenue saloon-keeper, died this
morning at 11:40 o'clock in the cell from
which he was never taken except to be
carried by attendants. Jones was under
the shadow of the gallows, but he escaped
the execution of the death penalty im
posed at the time of his conviction
through the action of Former Superior
Judge E. M. Gibson, who granted Jones
a new trial, the point being that the ac
cused murderer had not been taken to
the scene of the homicide when the jury
had Inspected the place.
Before the second trial was held Jones
was stricken with paralysis, and his
physical condition precluded the possibil
ity that he would ever go before the bar
of any earthly court to again answer to
the charge of murder. For nearly twen
ty years the bedridden prisoner remained
almost speechless and unable to move
without assistance on the cot where he
breathed his last. He was in his 94th
year. In all of the months the old man
laid in Jail he never spoke of the crime,
nor offered a word of explanation. While
he was a prisoner the modern electric
street car waa introduced. One day he
was taken to a Jail window and saw the
new vehicles whizzing by. The Eight
startled the old man, and never again
did he ask to leave his cell.
While the .officers were in the room Hen
ry Stapf, a friend of the two men, hap
pened to drop in on a friendly â¢visit and
was also taken into custody. The trio
were lodged in the City Prison and their
names entered on the detinue book. The
police of Boston were communicated with
by telegraph, but up to a late hour a re
ply had not been received.
The two men were brought together
and Steinberg accused Hanivan of steal
ing his wearing apparel. The latter de
nied his guilt. Crimination and recrimi
nation followed und Steinberg at last
made the direct accusation that Hanivan
had stolen a quantity of silverware from
the University Club of Boston, where he
had been employed as bellboy. Hanivan
retaliated by informing the detectives that
Steinberg had secured $250 worth of fur
nitured in Boston upon the payment of
$150 and had then shipped the goods to
this city.
An examination of the room brought to
light thirty pieces of silverware which
were stamped with the name of the Uni
versity Club of Boston. The furniture al
luded to by Hanivan was also found in
the room, together with receipts which
seem to prove that Steinberg moved the
goods before he had Â« acquired title to
them.
Everything was moving smoothly until
the disappearance of the suit of clothes.
Steinberg presented himself at the Hall
of Justice Monday afternoon and poured
his tale of woe into the ever-open ear of
Captain Martin, confiding to that official
the suspicion that his roommate was
guilty of the theft. Detectives Ryan and
Taylor were detailed on the case and were
entirely unprepared for the denouement
that occurred.
Hanivan and Steinberg arrived in this
city from Boston about two months ago
and took up quarters at 105 Ellis street.
Steinberg, who claims to be an East In
dian, took upon himself the name of Ra
mlnia Aramancha and advertised ex
tensively In the daily papers, calling at
tention to his remarkable power to prog
nosticate through the medium of the
stars. Aramancha prospered, as many of
those anxious to peep just a wee bit into
the hidden mysteries of the future en
listed his services.
That in some cases the accepted maxim
"there is honor among thieves" can be
regarded as a fallacy was rather forcibly
illustrated last night by the arrest and
detention of Frank Hanlvan and Julian
Steinberg, the latter known also as Ra
minia Aramancha, pending advices from
the authorities of Boston, Mass.
The loss of a suit of clothes owned by
Hanivan and his evident mistrust of his
companion was responsible for the pre
dicament the two men now find them
selves inâ felony charges staring them in
the face in Boston.
â¢ It â¢was further stated the Native Sons
propose to get up a silver service to pre
pent to the cruiser, and ways will be de-
S'ised Ly the committee to raise the funds
required for the purchase of such service;
also that the members of the organization
In all parts of the State will probably be
appealed to, to assist, as it is desired
that it shall be a California contribution
ta a California ship, obtained only
through the Native Sons.
It was also stated that the parlors of
Oakland are arranging for an event in
aid of the fund. It will consist of an en
tertainment at Idora Park, and Joseph
II. Knowland is one of the prime movers
In the matter.
A Fjp^estlon was made that the Native
Boris of this city, with the aid of the
membership of the Native Daughters of
the Golden West, arrange a monster
bazar and promenade concerts at the Me
chanics' Pavilion, to run ten days or two
tveeks, as a means of adding to the fund.
The matter was received with favor and
It was referred to the executive commit
tee to consider the suggestion and report
on the advlsabllty of such an undertaking-.
BAZAB AND CONCEBT.
The executive committee that superin
tended the recent minstrel show in aid
at the launching fund reported that it
was not as yet in a postion to make a full
report, as tickets had not yet been ac
counted for by many cf parlors that had
received them, but it was thought that
more than $509 will be realized. It was
nlso rtated that under the contract with
the minstrel company there .is still one
more performance to be given for the
fjLind, and that an effort will be made to
pive it in San Jose. The executive com
mittee was authorized to give that per
formance, which will also be for the ben
efit of the fund, in either San Jose, Val-
Jejr> or Stockton.
W. H. Hazell, treasurer of the commit
tee on celebration of Admission day at
Ban Jose, 6tated that the proceeds of
that day will net the launching fund a
little in excess of 11609.
The conpenFUs of opinion, almost unani
mous, was that that paper should be told
that the launching was a purely Native
Sons affair and that it must keep its
hands oft*. The best method of conveying
this idea to the parties for whom inlend
Â«-d was the subject of considerable dis
cussion and it was finally decided to re
fer the matter to the executive commit
tee, which will suggest what course to
pursue.
MUST KEEP HANDS OFF.
This led to a lenpthy discussion on the
course of the Examiner in "butting in"
In matters in which it was not asked to
â¢t?ke a part. It was stated that it must
â¢have been within the knowledge of the
rtanagers of that paper that the Native
â¢Fons had been working for more than a
year making arrangements for the
launching of the cruiser and for the pro
curing of the silver service, and that it
looked once more as if that paper was
trying to Rdvert'se Itself at the expense
of the Native Sons, in the way it had
done regarding California landmarks.
verely denounced last evening by , the
â¢committee of the Native Sons that has
worked for one year to secure funds for
the presentation of the memento to the
warp hip.
â¢ The Native Sons' committee that is to
have exclusive charce of the launching of
the cruiser met last night, and the atti
tude of the Examiner was officially
brought to the notice of the members'.
-The statement was made by one of the
committee that the Examiner had sought
.to .have the school children of the city
-contribute to the purchase of the silver
service for the cruiser, and had an

of the money so raised.
The attempt of the Examiner to take

for the new cruiser California was se-
After the selection of the jury the case
was continued until 2 o'clock to-morrow.
It is expected that evidence of a highly
sensational character will be introduced
and that the case will be most bitterly
contested.
The contestant's attorneys are Byron
Waters and W. Wylie of Los Angeles.
For the beneficiaries are Attorney W. S.
Goodfellow and District Attorney J. J.
Allen. . '
After much challenging by*the various
attorneys in the case, the following
named were selected and sworn in: W.
D. Thomas, W. Berry. Carl Berlin, R.
Wland. H. W. Prall, M. Y. Smith, E.
Kirchoff, W. F. Larrabee, C. B. Rice,
Seymour Johnson, M. Donohue and J.
Bridgeman.
The principals in the case present to
day were Fred W. ; Lloyd, Charles R.
Lloyd, Jr., and Mrs. Nix, a daughter of
Mrs. *Mary R. Lloyd. The daughters,
Mabel and Ethel LJoyd, were in the court
house, but remained outside of the court
room.
Attorney W. S. Goodfellow, for the pro
ponents of the will, asked at the begin
ning of the afternoon session that the
case be tried behind closed doors. Waters
objected and Judge Hall sustained his
objection. The rest of the afternoon was
taken up in the selection of the* jury.
JURORS SELECTED.
The reasons for wishing a continuance
were given that Mrs. Mary R. Lloyd, the
widow, was ill and unable to be pres
ent; that the deposition of a witness in
Fort Wayne had not. yet been secured;
and that the jury called in the case was
summoned originally to appear in depart
ment 5 of the Superior Court and could
not be transferred to another department.
After argument by the opposing attor
neys Judge Hall overruled the objections
and decided to take the testimony of the
contestant, Fred W. Lloyd, as to the con
dition and probable testimony of Mrs.
Mary Lloyd. Lloyd deposed that he had
seen Mary Lloyd at 8:40 o'clock at her
home, 1114 Fourteenth street, this morn
ing and that she was very Blck. Notwith
standing this testimony Judge Hall
ordered the trial to proceed.
Attorney Waters then outlined what the
contestant expected to prove by Mrs.
Mary Lloyd, who was Lloyd's house
keeper before she wedded him. This was
to the effect that Charles R. Lloyd was
depraved and was Insane on the subject
of matrimony. On one occasion, it is
alleged, half an hour after having met a
woman Lloyd proposed marriage to her,
and again on two days' acquaintance
with another woman he proposed matri
mony.
WIDOW IS ILL.
The widow, who was Lloyd's second
wife, children other than the contestant.
Mabel Lloyd. Captain Charles R. Lloyd
Jr. and Ethel Lloyd, and his housekeeper,
Miss Wilkinson, were the beneficiaries.
Lloyd was seriously wounded by Will
iam Boxall in January, the cause of the
affray being wTongs alleged to have been
committed by Lloyd against Boxall's sis
ters. Recovering partially, Lloyd left for
Japan on. a pleasure trip before Boxall
could be prosecuted. He was at the time
placed under bonds pi $100,000 to insure
his appearance at the trial of his nephew.
While on shipboard Lloyd suddenly died,
his demise being attributed to heart fall
use. The case against Boxall is still pend
ing.
Much of yesterday's morning session -was
spent by Attorney Byron Waters, counsel
for the contestant, in an endeavor to se
cure a continuance, on the ground that
his client was not prepared to go on with
the case.
Trial of the suit to break the will of
the late Charles R. Lloyd, the Berkeley
capitalist, the shooting of whom by his
nephew, William Boxall, in San Ber
nardino last January created a sensation,
was begun this morning in department 4
of the Superior Court before Judge Hall.
The contest was brought by Frederick W.
Lloyd, j eldest son of the deceased, he
having been disinherited by his father.
The estate consists mainly of stocks and
bonds of a value of about 1350,000.
It is alleged by the contesting son that
his father was insane and under the un
due influence of .his wife and Miss Wil
kinson, his housekeeper, at the time he
made his will.

CRACKLES SUIT
BEFORE COURT
Young Landgraf was subpenaed as a
witness and was ordered to appear in
court with his books. He answered the
summons, but before he could be placed
on the witness stand he disappeared.
Judge Prior issued a bench warrant for
Landgraf's arrest. Miss Eaton was
admonished to keep away from Mill Val
ley. On Sunday evening she was seen
there and her father was notified. He
caused her removal to this city and de
tention in the Receiving Hospital.
Landgraf's father did his utmost to
break off the friendship that existed be
tween his son and the young woman. He
communicated with her father and he
tried his utmost to keep his daughter at
home. Despite his efforts she would slip
out of the house and go to Mill Valley,
remaining there several days and sleep
ing in the stable. On one occasion she
hid in one of the stalls in the stable and
on being discovered retreated to the dense
woods surrounding Mill Valley.
Last week Joseph Landgraf Sr. secnred
a warrant for the arrest of the young girl
on a charge of vagrancy. The unfortu
nate girl was taken Into custody and sub
sequently appeared before Judge Pri6r of
Sausalito. She pleaded not guilty and de
manded a Jury trial. When the case came
up last Wednesday Miss Eaton., In her
own defense, claimed that she had been
employed by Landrgraf to keep his books
and she was earning her livelihood in that
way.
Occupying a cell In the detention ward
of the Central Emergency Hospital is
pretty Hattie Baton, daughter of A. J.
Katon, who resides at 833 Shrader street,
this city. The young girl's detention Is
due to her constant desire to go over to
Mill Valley. Her presence and eccentric
conduct while In that suburb have at
tracted a great deal of attention and oc
casioned much adverse comment from the
residents of that place.
jvuss Eaton is a pretty girl. She became
Infatuated with Joseph Landgraf Jr., a
well-known stableman of Mill Valley, and
has frequently crosseu the bay to be near
him. Landgraf at first was flattered by
her attentions to him, but when his
friends began to chaff him he became
worried. He pleaded with the young
woman to stay away, but she refused and
her persistency has been rewarded by her
being taken Into custody. There is a fear
that she is mentally unbalanced. , She will
be examined by physicians to-day and in
all probability will be sent toÂ»a private
sanitarium.

fied that he came home from school at
noon, but (^Id-not complain. At 3 o'clock
he told her of the beating he had re
ceived, and on investigation she found his
legs were black and blue and that the
skin had been torn in places.
A number of pupils testified that they
had witnessed the whipping of Duig
nan. Most of them stated that it
lasted for from fifteen to twenty min
utes. One of, the pupils said Frank had
turned around In line, when Miss Dwyer
grabbed him by the collar and she broke
the rattan when she whipped him. Frank
cried, "Stop a stop!" and Miss Dwyer hit
him on the' left .temple, which left a
mark and cried out, "I don't care where
I hit you."
Platt auestioned the pupils as to how
they had fixed the length of timÂ© the
punishment had lasted. One replied he
had looked at the clock and others that
the bell to form line had rung at 10:45
a. m. and the pupils did not reach their
class rooms until about 11:05, the pun
ishment having been Inflicted in the mean
time.
TESTIFIES AS EXPERT.
Deputy Superintendent of Schools How
ard testified to seeing the wounds on the
boy's legs, but would not express an
opinion as to whether the punishment was
severe. Howard also testified as an ex
pert, saying that the bruises could have
been made by the rattan, which was pro
duced In evidence and is rather a light
affair.
In her own defense Miss Dwyer said
the boys had been unruly and Dulgnan
was whistling in line. She began to pun
ish him and he jumped and pulled and
finally kicked her.
"If the boy was struck on the head It
must have been accidental, as I have no
knowledge of It," said Miss Dwyer. "I
do not think the punishment was un
usual. I have been informed by physi
cians that it is physically impossible to
make a mark with a rattan. I am 6ure
the punishment lasted but five minutes.
I also submit that It is a physical im
possibility to whip a boy twenty minutes
without becoming exhausted. I have
whipped pupils before and become per
fectly exhausted and yet administered but
a few strokes."
Miss Dwyer refused to answer two ques
tions of Henry Kelly, the boy's uncle,
as to whether she- had not gone to the
Appraiser's building to encompass his
dismissal from his position if he did not
abandon the proceedings against her and
that she had sent a girl to urge Mrs.
Duignan, aunt of the boy, to go ahead
with her intention of taking the case to
the Police courts. r/\:v < v

Symphony Leader Will Re

March.
With the tumbling wealth of Schubert
In our ears (the C major symphony No.
10), Scheel leaves us this week, after a
season of ripe success. Yesterday after
noon was the last concert of the first half
of our season and in Its symphony rank-
Ing with the best. The audience was
gratifyingly large and prepared for no
end of hero worship. Hands and hearts
were the conductor's all through and
afterward the people loitered about until
the stage hands shut off the lights, as If
loth to leave the scene of the music fete
of the last weeks. In March next we
shall have the second half of the series,
with ten concerts, to be given in the even
ing, and with the new odd man or two
that the band needs. In the meantime
the San Francisco Symphony Society
must be at work to fill every seat with a
subscriber for the spring concerts. Hap
pily there Beema to be every prospect" of
so doing. Never, Indeed, in the local his
tory of symphony has there seemed so
fair/ promise of a permanent orchestra
,and never again will, be so good a time
as now to work for It. We shall have it,
of course, as we of the West get every
thing we want, and it is in the nature of
us greatly to want the great thing musi
cal. But we may as well have it now as
ten years hence, and the months from
now to March will surely determine for
some years whether we are to have or
not to have a permanent symphony or
chestra. Imagine being sure of a Schu
bert No. 10 every week, every year!
It was charmingly given yesterday on
the whole. Mr. Scheel himself seems to
have a peculiar affinity for Schubert. In
his memories of things precious the Man
Who Knows holds firmly to a Scheel read;
ing of the Unfinished Symphony as a per
formance without flaw. Others of us re
member that reading, and yesterday's
symphony had the same vivid sympathy
and understanding. The rendering, how
ever, was rough in spots, lacking some
thing of spring and zip (in the scherzo),
and the intonation was by no means al
ways comfortable. When this is said,
however, all Is said on the debit side. The
orchestra responded eloquently in the
first andante, with its grave flow and lus
cious harmonies. The second movement,
profusely melodious and with the same
wonderful harmonic wealth, its garlands,
wreaths and festoons of lovely ornament,
was eheerly delightful and delightfully
played. It was not easy to pull the
scherzo along at the mile-a-mlnute pace
Mr. Schubert set, and Scheel decided for
it, as I have said before. Still one forgot
this In the finale, with Its thunderous
themeâ like the tfead of Krishna from
star to star as he stamped his grief for
his dead mate into their bright bodies,
ripely understood and satisfyingly played
by the orchestra.
Then for novelty there was Dr. H. JL
Stewart's orchestral suite, "Montezuma,"
written for the Bohemian Club high Jinks
of thla summer, in accompaniment to
Louis A. Robertson's drama of the same
name and now first given to those in out
er darkness. The work is in four num
bers, "Darkness and Dawn," "Intermez
zo," "Valse Lente" and "Processional
March." Dr. Stewart is unfortunate in
coming after Mascagni In his first move
ment, that is expressive of dawn in much
the same fashion as the Italian composer
in his "Hymn to the Sun," perhaps in
evitably. The movement is, however,
pleasing, simple and expressive In its
theme, logical In its build and was very
well \ received. Dr. Stewart makes no
great use of orchestral color, the instru
mentation being straight away and with
out any attempt at anything approach
ing" subtlety. Except in the "March,"
however â where a Chinese Â¦ cymbal or its
twin is used in a distressing syncopation â
It Is smooth, pleasing and graceful. .
Much the best movement is the "Valse
Lente," that with Scheel of the Vienna
Prater behind it, became a number that
should be very welcome on the lighter
orchestral programmes. It has a fascin
ating swing and Mr. Scheel made the
most of It. . -â¢
The "Intermezzo" is hardly worthy of
its company. Its principal theme bor
ders on the commonplace, though It Is
well worked out and the piece is unfor
tunate in following a similar three-four
movement, with a characteristic suave
triplet that the composer seems to affect.
The "March" is, again, a swinging and
effective movement, also destined to find
orchestral favor. The composer was
called to the stage to acknowledge the
hearty plaudits of the audience, both after
the "Intermezzo" and at the close of the
work.
The Leonora overture, not remarkably
played, and the Lizst Rhapsodie No. 2,
brilliantly orchestrated by Muller-Berg
haus and dashingly given, completed the
programme. March brings the next.

BENEFIT ENTERTAINMENT
GIVEN FOR ORGAN CLUB
Salesian Council of Young Men's In
stitute Gives Clever Amateur
Performance.^
An entertainment for the benefit of the
Sts. Peter and Paul's organ fund was given
last -evening at Native Sons' Hall by
Salesian Council No. 565, Young : Men's
Institute. The large hall was filled with
an enthusiastic audience, for the pro
gramme was an unusually good one.
The evening opened with an overture,
which was very well rendered by the San
Francisco Conservatory Mandolin Club.
Mrs. Craven and Harry Wood Brown
sang a duet from "II Trovatore," which
brought forth shouts- of- applause, and
"Billy" Hines produced the shrieks of
laughter that generally accompany his
"humorous songs and sayings."
A large chorus of thirty-six voices sang
the "Leeend of Bells" from "The Bells
of Corneville," which was somewhat of
a climax, marking the last musical num
ber on the programme, .
The entertainment was brought to a
close with a clever little farce entitled
"The Living Statue," exceedingly ludicrous
and well played by Enrico Brusco Giorgio
Ollva, Attilio Pescia and, Luigi Galll.

POLICEMAN CONWAY
CALLED BY DEATH
BERLIN, Oct. 6.â An electric car on
the Marienfelde-Zossen experimental line
reached a speed of 125 4-5 miles an hour to
day, or a kilometer more than the highest
previous record. The machinery and rcad
bed were unimpaired. The current was
between 13,000 and 14,000 volts, capable of
driving the car at the rate of more than
203 miles an hour.
The lives of all on board the experi
mental car were heavily insured.
A large party of engineers, military men
and civilians 'gathered where the highest
points of speed aÂ»e reported in the experi
ments. A French observer remarked that
the new sensation of the power of velocity
Inspired by the car's flight was worth
traveling from Paris to see.
There were twelve to. fourteen persons
on board the car, all technical men. They
auirm that the motion of the car was no
greater than that of an ordinary express
train. A curious feature eccoxnpanylng
the test Is the continuous sparkling of
electricity from the six trolley arms.
Wfiile the engineers do not believe a speed
of 125 miles is practicable at present on
the 6tate roads, they are prepared to rec
ommend a speed of ninety-three miles an
hour between Berlin and Hamburg.

Officer Who Performed Excellent Ser
vice in Department for Many
Years Expires.
Thomas Conway, a member of the San
Francisco police force, died of general de
bility at his home In this city last even
ing. He was appointed to the force in
1884, and his record since has been most
excellent. He was regarded by his
superiors as one of the best men in the
department, and in the riotous days of
the Barbary Coast performed efficient and
fearless service. Many Important cap
tures were made by him, and he contin
ued his good work until a short time ago,
when his health began to fail.
For many years Conway was connected
with the Central Police Station, but until
the time of his last illness was detailed

Before entering the department he was a
tanner by occupation. His mother sur

WHEAT FREIGHTSâ A French bark has
Just been taken for Barley, usual European op
tions, at 14Â», which is about an average rate
for spot business. It is pretty low. The char
tered wheat fleet in port haÂ« a registered ton
nage of 41,600. aganlst 54,300 tons on the same
date last year; disengaged, 105,500 tons,
against 60,350: on the way to this port, 277,
400 tons, ajtainst 214,000.
WHEATâ There is very little new in the sit
uation, either here, in the East or abroad. |
Chicago reported a little export business. This
market continued quiet, with growers rather
more inclined to let go at full Hgures and
buyers somewhat Indifferent.
The Chicago letter of Bolton, de Ruyter &
â¢'Cables showed some steadiness and there
was little improvement in the cash situation.
There was a moderate milling demand here.
Kansas City market firm. There were rumors
of considerable export business having been
worked via Galveston, but so far it lacks con
firmation. Seaboard exporters report bids out
of line and business small. The bearish fea
ture of the day was Bradstreet s estimate of
13,000,000 bushels Increase In the world's vis
ible. Primary receipts are a shade 1 less than
last year. The weekly Government report says
threshing and marketing in the Northwest have
again been interfered with to some extent by
rains. Strike situation In Minneapolis mills
is still a matter of some uncertainty. The
mills seem to be gaining, but there is danger
of further sympathetic strikes. On the whole
we see no material change In conditions.
Stocks of wheat are likely to continue to In
'crease somewhat for weeks to come and the
lead on speculation grows a little heavier day
by day. . We do not therefore see anything
encouraging to buyers of wheat. Think we
would rather sell It on the hard spots."

DRESSED MEATS.
Meat Market.
Local trade in fresh fruits was quiet and
prices of most descriptions stood as previ
ously quoted. There was no shipping to near
by points, but there was a steady demand for
faficy Apples and Pears for shipment to Hono
lulu on the steamer Ventura, out to-morrow.
Three cars of fancy Apples were shipped from
Watsonvllle for that purpose. The market was
overloaded with cheap . Apples, which moved
elowly at unsteady prices. Supplies of table
Grapes continued excessive and prices wero
unsteady, except for choice 'Muscat In large
boxes, which were in. small supply and cleaned
up well at tbs maximum quotations. Wine
Grapes too, were easy, receipts being heavy
and the carry-over from the preceding day
large. Stocks of Peaches were light and prices
were a little firmer, but the demand was slack.
The other tree fruits stood about as previously
quoted. Cantaloupes and Nutmeg Melons ar
rived freely and moved slowly, no reasonable
offer being refused for the general run of sup
plies Watermelons were, in fair request and
steady. There were no ' changes in Berries.
The canners â¢ were still buylnc surplus stocks
of Raspberries at the minimum quotation,
while poor quality offerings of large Strawber
ries cleaned up to the peddlers at the inside

over 28c must be especially choice and then
sold in small lots. No round lots will bring
over this figure. Most houses are overstocked
and offering their goods everywhere at conces
sions to sell them.
Fine mild Cheese Is doing better, but the.
medium and lower grades do not budge from
previous quotations. There is plenty of low
grade Cheese still on the market readily pur
chasable at lie. This Includes large lines from

NEW YORK, Oct. 6.â To-day's stock mar
ket lay rractically in a lethargy, pending the
t-ction of the L'nited States Steel directors on
the common Ftock dividend. This actioa had
r.ot been decided up to the close of the market,
und the repressive influence of the suspense,
accordingly, was not removed. Dealings were
tne smallest for many week?, and, small aa
thej- were, a large proportion of the whole. waji
fcbfciTbed liy thf I'nited f<ui:.Â£s Stt'el. Â»ccunuÂ«,
w hlch were- the only stocks in which the un
certainty over 'the dividend action was made
the occasion for speculative price movement to
any extent. This is largely due to the fact
that r\e financial world has been in great
doubt over what the effect would be ot the
dividend action. Whether the passing or reduc
tion or the dividend could result in any further
Jail in urice of the company's securities had
been much questioned. The conservation of
the surplus, it is now believed, would have
held the market i>rlce of the securities better
than the distribution of dividends on the com
mon stock, which has proved utterly unavail
ing to hold the market. The sharp advance
in the preferred stock this afternoon of more
than two points, when the common stock was
but elishtly affected, ras due to the party
that was in doubt ov* the conslderatkn of
the dividend, and which believed that tne ad
ditional security for the preferred by the re
tention of the mr: his in the treasury would
result in hirher prices. Outside of the Steal
stocks the market was exceedingly narrow and
the movements insignificant. Only a handful
of storks got as much as a point away Irom
last nijfht. and extreme movements were not
maintained in any place. The early movement
was downward, and London assisted in this
tendency to some extent on account of the un
settled opinion in the stock market from the
British Cabinet changes. Some selling was re
ported to be for Western account, and may nave
been associated with the reports of deterioration
of the wheat yield in one or two of the Western
States, which al*o caused a firm tone in the
wheat market. The Government's weekly re
port on corn was considered highly satisfac
tory, but the report on cotton was felt to
leave a good deal to be desired. There was no
pressure .of liquidation at any point, and the
market rallied in sympathy with the late up
ward movement In United States Steel prefer
red. The full recovery was not held, but the
closing was steady and Ehowcd very slight net
changes aa a rule. The time money market
seems to be growing softer, and appTehen-
Fion cf any real stringency has been/pretty
well dissipated. The large movement*of gold
toward London and the cessation of Berlin de
mands for gold seem to assure the prospects
for that center. The lateness of the crops
does not seem fully to account for tho long
payment of demand for currency, and the be
lief Is gaining force that the deposit of Gov
ernment funds with Western banks has sup
plied a sufficient proportion of the usual dÂ«
mard to relax the pressure on New York de
cidedly.
The market for bonds was %*ry dull and
nl-out steady. Total sales, par value. $2,643,000.

The Potato market Is weak except for strict
ly fancy Salinas Burbanks, which are in fair
request for local consumption. The daily re
ceipts of river Burbanks continue too heavy
for the market to absorb and stocks are steadily
accumulating. Sweet Pctatoes are arriving
freely and meet with a good demand at fair
prices. A carload arrived from Merced yes
terday and cleaned up quickly at the top rate,
while carried-over stock was rather dull at
the Inside quotation. Fancy Onions are a little
firmer under continued light receipts, but low
grade offerings are plentiful and dull.
There were heavy receipts of Tomatoes, a
large portion of which had been two days In
transit, and the market was weak at lower
prices. The canners were not In the market
and there was quite a large quantity unsold
at the close. Strlnp Beans were plentiful and
easy, while Wax and Lima were In small sup
ply and steady. The other vegetables were in
free supply and prices were without quotable
change.

strong at a material discount, and stocks
everywhere are liberal for the season of the
year, i We see nothing to make higher prices."

To swat the sphere for a home run.
He sets well paid to do such deeds;
And thus supplies his daily needs.

But we can win in life's great game.
By home runs get success and fame.

A peculiar case was tried by Judge
Graham yesterday. It was a suit for an
annulment of a marriage. The plaintiff
was Frank Rossini and the defendants
Jennie Rossini and Fred Cuppers. Both
men were married to the woman' within
the last three years, Rossini being the
first to make her his wife. A few months
after becoming Mrs. Rossini, and without
bothering about such a minor thing as a
divorce, she became the wife of Cuppers.
Rossini did not learn of the marriage
until auite recently and he Immediately
filed a suit to have the second marriage
annuled, claiming that at the time it was
performed his wife was not In possession
of her sound senses. Judge Graham
granted his prayer. -â' -Â¦
Mrs. Rossini could give no lucid ex
planation of her action yesterday. She
said the only thing she could say In ex
cuse of her conduct was the fact that
Cuppers seemed to have hypnotic power
and could do with her as he wished. She
said she left her home to become the
wife of Cuppers simply because he willed
that she should. She said she never cared
for him, in fact had no use for him at all.
Laura E. Martin wants a divorce from
Richard Martin for cruelty. They were
married at Stockton in 1S91 and have
three children. Their home Is at 809
Castro street. She says in her complaint
that Martin has frequently, during the
last three years, threatened to kill her.
She also says that he Is jealous and
makes her life miserable by accusing her
of. Bhowering her affections upon others
than himself.
Cruelty Is one of "the grounds , for di
vorce on which Delia Imes Is suing Will
iam A. lines. The other two ground3
are Intemperance and neglect. She
charges that for the last five years he
has drank to excess and bas been rough
and abusive. During that time, she says,
because of his fondness for drink, he has
not been able to provide for her.
Lillias M. Wallace Is suing for divorce
on the ground of Intemperance. Her hus
band is Robert S. Wallace. -
Desertion Is charged^ in the suits
brought by Victor Friacca/ against Rosa
Friacca, and Bine Berendsohn against

Interlocutory decrees of divorce were
granted to Jenneft Williams from A. L.

The suit for injunction restraining A.
Ottinger, the ticket broker, from dealing 1
in tickets sold by the Southern Pacific
and other railroads during the recent
Grand Army Encampment was argued

It was learned yesterday that he â¢ had
not paid his room rent at the Russ for
two " months, but Mr.' Gregory added i" to
this information the statement that Pills
bury had not cashed his salary warrants
About a year ago the missing young
man suffered the loss of his, wife and
child, and their death deeply affected him,
a fact that was frequently ' noticed j by
his associates in the railroad office. Some
of his friends are disposed to think that
he became despondent and while In the
mood went to some remote spot and killed
himself. He has Â¦ been working hard of
late, sometimes - until midnight, and: this
may have added to his supposed mental
troubles.
LOSES WIFE AND CHILD.
Pillsbury was formerly connected with
a local transfer company and received
his appointment as clerk in the Santa
Fe office simply on his showing of energy
In the duties connected with his previous
work. â¢ â¢ -V ; --*-y
"Pillsbury was highly regarded by every
one connected with the local office. Per
sonally, I regarded him as a most trust
worthy fellow, a fact which he had . al
ready demonstrated during his twelve
months' employment behind the ticket
counter, where he handled thousands' of
dollars, and was most exacting in account
ing for the money that passed through
his hands. He was recently assigned to
the valley agency and had been perform
ing his duties in a most conscientious
manner. The only reason I am Inclined
j to advance for his absence Is that he has
j become mentally depressed over exces-
I Blve worrying or has met with some acci
dent"' ;,".,-' "r-v:- ; .^ -'- s - ;
In discussing the strange disappearance
of the young man yesterday Assistant
Passenger Agent Gregory said that he
was at a loss for an explanation .for the
absence of the agent, and he added:
BEABS GOOD REPUTATION.
On Monday, however, when it was dis
covered that he was still absent the fact
caused some comment, and finally the
attention of Assistant Passenger Agent
H. K. Gregory was called to the matter.
The last named telegraphed to Merced
and other points in the vicinity of the
valley, but cot the response that Pills
bury had not been seen there. It , was
then that Mr. Gregory started an Investi
gation that developed the fact that the
missing man Imd not been near his rooms
in the Russ House since Friday morning.
Otto Zeus, a clerk in the company's
ticket office, occupied the Russ House
apartments with Pillsbury. He stated to
3>Ir. Gregory that he had had luncheon
with his roommate on Friday and that
they had returned to the railroad office
together. When Pillsbury suddenly left
the office later in the afternoon It was
supposed that he was going out on the
street on some business mission and when
he failed to return to his room, at the
hotel that night Zeus shared the opinion
of others that Pillsbury had gone . to
Merced.
Pillsbury appeared In the best of spirits
Friday afternoon when he left his desk
in the Market-street office about 4 o'clock
to engage In conversation with one of
the clerks behind the ticket counter. Sud
denly leaving the counter, he walked out
of the office and that was the last that
has been seen of him. When he failed
to report for work Saturday morning lit
tle heed was paid to hia absence, for it
was thought that possibly he had gone
to Merced on business connected wi*h the
stage lines that operate in conjunction
with the railroad In handling traffic in
and out of the valley.
OFFICIALS INVESTIQATIMTG.
The local officials of the Santa Fe Com
pany, have asked the Police Department
to assist them in locating Frank Pills
bury_ who until recently held the posi
tion of Tosemite Valley agent for the
railroad In this city. â¢ Pillsbury disap
peared rather mysteriously last Friday
and all efforts to find him have proved
futile. Fears, based on certain circum
stances, have aroused the suspicion that
he has made away with himself or has
met with a mishap and is confined in
some place near the city.

Restlessly the ghost of the Dimmlck
case reared its head yesterday In the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals
when George D. Collins, counsel for Wal
ter N. Dlmmick, appeared to make an
other attempt to get his client out of the
penitentiary.
Mr. Collins moved that the Judgment of
the court be modified by reversing the
judgment of the District Court to the ex
tent that said judgment orders the Im
prisonment of Walter N. Dimmick in the
penitentiary at San Quentin. Mr. Col
lins contended that the District Court is
deprived of all power and jurisdiction to
Fentence Dlmmick upon any count In the
indictment to Imprisonment In the peni
tentiary where the term Is, upon the
count, for one j-ear only, and that each
count of the Indictment and the Imprison
ment thereon are to be considered as
though had on a separate indictment.
The court stayed the mandate for twen
ty days.

VEIiL KNOWN COUPLE Wll/Ii .
BE MADE ONE TO-DAY
Somebody had voted twice, and. shock-
Ing to relate. It: was none other than the
worthy, president. And .the evidence pro
duced was surely incriminating, for the
secretary so testified. Virginia blood ran
high; the whole assembly tried to tell at
one tlme'of the heinousness of the crimeâ
and a motion was made amid , rejoicing
that the two , electionsâ that of -. the presi
dent and Â¦ registrarâ at which Mrs.- Wright
voted wrong, be thrown out as irrelevant,
Incompetent and Immaterial. Then came
the coup * d'etat. Mrs. Van Wyck was
gayly nominated for . president, and was
elected unanimouslyâ by her own chapter
âto become the -presiding spirit of the
future state deliberations. A, love feast
In fewer minutes than It takes to write
It, Mrs. Jacobs, a clever member of the
secessionists, had mounted the rostrumâ
from which the^fitars and Stripes floated
serenelyâ andjiad rapped loudly for or
der. Instantly she was Joined by Mrs.
Dalngerfleld and* others, who declared
that the action of President Wright in
declaring the convention adjourned with
out tlie proper procedure was unwar
ranted and Illegal Â»nd that the remain
ing members resume the unfinished busi
ness and -take exception, from the ruling
of the* chair. This motion went through
the resurrected body with a rush and
then the secretary made an awful dis
covery. 'Â¦[:â¢'.
In vain had Mrs. Daingerfleld tried to
explain that the convent^n of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy was still
In session, and there was more business
before the house.
Here her ballot won the' coveted honor
for Mrs. V. Montgomery of Los Angeles,
but alas for the frailty of earthly honorsl
Not more than half the convention was
on its feet at any one time during the
nine hours' session, except when a mem
ber of the Jefferson Davis Chapter tried
to talk. Then there was trouble. The
gavel rapped loud and yet louder, while
the supporters of the delegate who sought
to be heard clapped long and furiously
that she hold her courageâ and the floor.
And thus the tide rose and fell; first one
side had its Inning, and then the other.
Half after 4 by the town clock and no
nominations, but plenty of recriminations.
Mrs. S. R. Thorpe, first vice president
and delegate from Los Angeles, tried
bravely to pour oil upon the waters, at
this late- hour, but the rulings of the chair
prevented the hoped for calm. Mrs. Ellis,
Mrs. Voorhies and Mrs. Churchill ably
led their cohorts, but were confronted by
a phalanx that disputed every advance
In the proceedings. A deadlock or an all
night session seemed imminent, when a
motion was made by a delegate from the
chapter, which was gracefully seconded
by Mrs. Van Wyck, the opposition leader.
This little episode served as a flag of
truce, and anon the nominating commit
tee was busy at its official duties. The
results of their deliberations' were in ac
cord with their instructions from home
and were regularly posted upon a black
board. Then the balloting began-and
here It might be well to suppress the re
port that it was necessary to summon a
peace officer. , '
The smoke of battle soon cleared suffi
ciently to discern that the following had
been elected for the State officesâ that is.
to all appearances they had been:
President, Mrs. V. Montgomery; first
vice president, Mrs. E. M. Bowen; second
vice president, Mrs. G. Smith; recording
secretary. Miss Hemenway; correspond
ing secretary, Mrs. G. Dalngerfield; treas
urer Mrs. R. E- Goswltch; registrar, Mrs.
G. Churchill; historian, Mrs. R. H. Lacy.
Immediately upon reading the result of
the various ballots a motion to adjourn
was made, and seconded by Albert Sidney
Johnston members and was announced
as carried by the president without the
little formality of putting the motion to
the house. With astonishing dispatch the
chairman gathered her gloves and be
longings, and totally oblivious of twenty
clamoring Jefferson Davlsltes, gesticulat
ing and vociferating for an appeal from the
chair, she vanished Into the gathering
dusk, followed by her stanch friends and
true.

superfluity of one vote, which the seces
sionists claim was illegally cast by the
president, Mrs. Selden S. Wrieht. In
fact they claim she cast two votes, which
is not good form even in women's clubs
one with her chapter and one after a
tie' had resulted In the presidential elec
tion.
Then, of needs they must be known
among the United Daughters of the Con
federacy, so they up and formed, a new
chapter, to be known by the name of
Jefferson Davis Chapter, of which Mrs.
Van Wyck. to soften the balm o'f her
wounded feelings, was elected president.
So far matters moved along beautifully,
until It was whispered that the new chap
ter vindicated Us secession from the par
ent body upon advice administered by the
national president, Mrs. Weed of Florida,
when she visited here. Now the merry
row begins. Â¦ Mrs. Weed says >he didn't
advise In the matterâ or to bÂ© more ac
curate, her husband. Bishop Weed, says
she didn't, and he ought to knowâ and
the leaders of the Jefferson Davis Chap
ter say she did. Then the presidents of
the two local chapters, with their respect
ive followers In this city, array the coun
try delegations for the present election
on their sides, and lo, the resultâ two
presidents and two registrars. Here is
a line-up of the factions as shown In yes
terday morning's preliminary skirmish:
The United Daughters of the Confed
eracy met yesterday at Century Hall for
the final day of their annual convention
and adjourned with the remarkable show
ing: of two presidents and two registrars,
and the tactics of the late Democratic
convention were prayerful by v ay of con
trast. And this is how it happened.
In th!s city there are two chapters of
the Daughters of the Confederacy, the
Albert Sidney Johnston and the Jefferson
Davis, the first mentioned holding' the
distinction of being: the pioneer chapter
on this side of the Rockies. Of this body
Mrs. Sydney Van Wyck in due time be
came president, but a cloudâ and a black
one â soon hover in sight and Mrs. Van
Wyck found it necessary for her peace
of mindâ likewise that of others -to re
sism. The resignation was accepted and
with the president went a large number
of members, who hadn't yet lost the habit
of secession.

Soon after the -Board of Police Com

County Roscommon, in 1878, and has lived
in San Francisco for the last seventeen
years. He Is a member of Laborers' Union
No. 8944. He resides at 1350 Folsom street.
Mr. Reagan Is prominent in labor circles,
having been a delegate to both the Labor
Council and Building Trades Council.
â¢ Casey thereupon took up Reagan's ap
plication with" Commissioner Manson and
after some deliberation the two Commis
sioners decided to grant him a leave of
absence.
Reagan made verbal application to Com
missioner Casey, president of the board,
for Jeave of absence. He informed Casey
that his acceptance was all that was nec
essary to make him a Police Commission
er,'but "as the appointment in the event
of Mayor Schmitz's defeat for Mayor
would be only for the unexplred term of
three months he desired to.be at liberty
to resume ' the duties of Inspector of
Street Sweepings in case Schmltz was not
successful at the polls.
Reagan was granted an Indefinite leaye
of absence by the Board of Public Work3
yesterday in order to enable him to ac
cept the office of Police Commissioner
without entirely giving up his position as
Inspector.
Reagan is at present Inspector of Street
Sweepings In â¢ the Department of "Works
and is a Democrat In politics. He stands
first on the civil service eligible list for
street Inspectors. .. '
