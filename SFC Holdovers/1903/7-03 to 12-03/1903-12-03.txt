In dealing with the alleged Irregu

office the report says: "From the facts

there may have been collusion between
the Public Administrator, j through his
attorneys, with the department^of the

After consulting with his attorneys
Receiver Currier said that the checks
would not be accepted. .This -decision
was made known also to the manager
of the Fresh Food Supply .of Zion,
which inclades-the butcher shop. In
a short time, when it had .become
known â¢ throughout the city, -'Â¦ it occa
sioned a panic among. those of Dowie's
followers whose only assets are /'the
trade â¢ checks. How these persons are
fo live during'the coming week,'unless
they are assisted by their more well
to-do neighbors, Is problematical.
At the Zion City^ general store, where
Receiver Currier was Introduced to Dea
con Clendenen, the general manager of
the stores, the question arose ' as to
whether the trade checks In use In Zion
City were to be accepted at the store
under . the receiver's , administration.
Clendenen 5aid that many residents of
Zion had little or no ready money' and
were depending on trade checks, which
were given as money. If these checks
were refused it would, '. he said, work
great hardship. > ... .
exact condition of the two banks to the
receivers.
Judge C. C. Kohlsaat, who yesterday
appointed the receivers, entered an or
der to-day restraining the prosecution
of any suits against Dowie, pending
the results of the receivership appoint
ed for Zion City. .
BANK'S CONDITION UNKNOWN:
The secrets of the Dowie Bank have
been, so closely guarded that not even
the State Auditor has been able to ob-'
tain a statement of the condition of the
institution. The Legiflature, through
a committee, sought to probe into the
methods of the bank three years ago.
but was forced to acknowledge defeat!
In Zlbn City all title to real estate is
\-ested in Dowie. The tract of land on
which Zion Is built was bought on. a
five-year payment plan. Several pay
ments are due, the last one falling upon
September 1, when Dowie paid up the
interest and asked for more time."
Mortgages on the land are held by the
original owners, and foreclosure would
mean forfeiture of the lots and houses
of the followers of Dowie.
This Is the. first time in the history
of surgery, far as the records go,
that the grafting of an ear has been
accomplished. Dr. Esmarch, the cele
brated'German surgeon, has striven re
peatedly to graft the whole or part of
an ear, but in no instance did the tis
sues unite. Plenty of subjects were sup
plied him from among German . stu
dents, whose ears are frequently
maimed in saber contests. The failure
of so eminent a surgeon as Dr. Es
march led surgeons the world over to
believe . that ear-grafting was prac
tically impossible.
"Wide attention has been attracted to
this case, around which great secrecy
has been thrown to prevent 'a revela
tion of the names of either the rich pa
tient or the ear seller.. This secrecy will
be maintained, but in the interests of
surgery Nelden decided to make public
all other facts in connection with the
case.
NEW YORK. Dec 2.â The announce
ment of the successful accomplishment
of the "grafting of the ear of one man
to the head, of another was made by
Dr. Andrew L. Xelden to-night. The
patient upon whom Nelden grafted an
ear is now being cared for in the phy
sician's home. He is overjoyed in the
physical possession of an ear which an
other man wore a little more than two
weeks ago.
The man who sold his ear for $5000 Is
now In a private sanitarium in Phila
delphia, where the operation was per
formed. He will be released in two
days and will" go immediately to his
home near Pittsburg, where his wife
and children are awaitiiig him. He is
perfectly satisfied with his bargain,
Xelden sayp, and will use the $5000 to
start life anew. The j/cher patient was
brought to this city to-day.

The receivers to-day found one of
Dowie's bank3 in operation at Twelfth
street and Michigan avenue, and they
promptly put an agent in charge and
had the doors closed. Judge Kohlsaat
later ratified the action of the receivers
in up this bank, as well as the
institution in Zion City. Experts have
been set at work on, the books of both
Institutions, and In a\few days, it is ex
pected, they will be able to report 1 the
Yesterday It was the opinion that
the liabilities of Dowie would not
amourrt, at the outside, to more than
JJ50.000. To-nlpht it was admitted by
the receivers and their "attorneys that
the -claims vaijainst him for merchadise
alone would aggregate $500,000, and in
addition to this amount that there are
mortgages on his property in Zion City
amounting to $125,000, which are due
the first of next year. He owes $100,000
to his brother-in-law, Samuel ""Steven
son, making a total of $725,000.
It is declared by the receivers .ap
pointed yeFte"rday for Zion City that
the affairs of Dowie are in a worse con
dition that was at first supposed. Re
ceiver Currier said to-nicht:
"I believe that Dr. Dowie will be able
t.o pay all his obligations In time. Just
how long this time will be Is some
thing that we' will not be able to tell
until we have made a thorough investi
gation of his effects. I understand
Dowie believes he 'will be able to settle
all claims against him In the course of
five weeks."
There "was a feeble "yes."
Â¦"Those- devils, parasites, the report
ers, came tome to-day. They wanted
to know "what I would say to you to
riight. Did they learn â¢from â¢ me?"
(Cries of "No.")
Dowie continued in this strain for
more than an hour and repeatedly
urged his hearers to come to the fin
ancial aid of Zion with All the means
at iheir disposal.
.'^'e want $1,000,000," he said, "and
I want the faithful here In Zion City
to contribute half of that sum; I want
it now â to-night."
The collection taken up is said to
h'ave amoupted to less than SI 000.
BOWIE'S LIABILITIES HUAVT.
"Beloved, I would like to take you
into niy confidence. A few minutes
ego I received a communication that
has caused the clouds to lift. They
are .beginning to part. I call upon
you to help me crush them. _ My peo

CHICAGO. Dec. 2. â A great gather-
Ing of *he Dowieites was held In the
â¢Tabernacle In Zion City to-night. It
wa"s. called by Dowie for the purpose
of starting- a fund of $1,000,000, with
whifh to pay off all the indebtedness
thai hangs- over Zion City arid him
.F*>lf.. The outpouring of his follow
ers, was rrot one to' brftig cheer to the
.heart of ihe "general overseer, of Zion.
The-.'Tabfrnacle seats . 6000 persons
and .'usually all the seats are taken at
the special meetings called by Dowie.
T^o-night the hall was not more than
"riillf filled and the gathering was not
as. enthusiastic as mighty be desired by
a inan who was in Immediate need of
. Dowie gave, to his f ollbwers a state
ment of the financial condition of Zion

were ample, the only trouble -being'
that he was not" able to realize upOil
them at /mce* All he needed was a

Special Dispatch to.Tha Can.
DOUGLAS. Ariz.. Dec. 2.â Dr. F. A.
Utz, who Just returned to Douglas from
Pinita County, Sonora. brings the story
of the death of- three frontier rene
gades, members of a notorious gang,
the leaders of which were killed or
captured several years ago. This small
remnant of the once noted band recent
ly had been commit ting* many depre
dations in Sonora. 'After the fight sev
eral years ago in "which their band was
broken up they had fled to the south,
and only returned to their old haunts
about two months ago. They had lost
their . horses and were crossing the
"country on foot,-, when a party of
twelve Mexican Rurales caught their
trail. From the descriptions received
at several ranches where the outlaws
had stopped to demand food at the
point of their revolvers the Rurales
identified the . three renegades, whom
they had orders to shoot on sight.
The trail was followed for a night and
two days. At the close of the second
day the tracks became fresh, and the
Rurales knew that they were close
upon the heels of the bandits. At sun
downVme of their number who was sent
out to reconnoiter reported that the
outlaws had stopped for the night at
a deserted mining camp just ahead.
The leader of the Rurales decided not
to risk a fight in the dim light of Hhe
evening, fearing that the'outlaws might
escape in the darkness. Instead he
posted his men in a picket line around
the' renegades' camp to prevent their
escape, and when the desperadoes arose
at daybreak the next morning all three
of them were shot down without quar
ter and before they could reach for
their rifles, which had been at their
sides during the night.
The Rurales felt justified In thus
dealing with the three worst men who
have visited the border country in re
cent years. One of the men was a
desperado of the worst type. His father
was killed twelve years ago in fight
with Mexican officers, and the son fol
lowed in the path made by the father
â a trail of pillage and bloodshed. The
Rurales knew that no quarter would be
asked if the bandits had discovered that
they were surrounded, and no quarter
was given. The whole troop .fired in
upon the outlaws and all three fell,
pierced by a half dozen bullets. The
bodies of the bandits were, left where
they had fallen. The Rurales did not
take the trouble to bury them, believ
ing that^it would be an example to all
of their calling to allow their bodies to
bleach upon the hillside as they had
done In the cases of many travelers!
miners and prospectors who met death
at their hands. . - -
WOMEN LAWYERS ARE
BARRED IN ENGLAND
House of Lords Decides That There
Is No Precedent for Admitting
Female Attorneys.
LONDON, Dec. 2.â The House of
Lords has finally decided that women
are" debarred by their sex, from being
qualified lawyers in' this country. . The
question arose on the appeal of a Lon
doner, Miss Bertha Cave, against the
decision of the benchers of Grays Inn
not. to admit her as a student for the
purpose of being called to the bar. The
court decided, that there was no prece
dent- for a woman's admission to Â¦ the
Inn of Court, and no reason to create
a precedent. The benchers assert that
the statutes of. Grays Inn ignore%wom
en so absolutely as to leave them no
power to admit a woman.'

ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. 2.â Inquiry
has been made at the Foreign Office
respecting the announcement from
Paris that a basis of agreement be
tween Russia and Japan haft' been
reached. It was impossible to obtain
any confirmation beyond the statement
that a mutual desire for- peace exists,
to which both negotiants have ex
pressed adherence." With this end In
view they have both decided tempor
arily to put aside questions whose de
cision, on account of the position of
each, is found to be impracticable;
The negotiations," so far as Russia is
concerned, are confined to delimiting
the rights of railroad, telegraph, etc.,
of each in Korea. Japan holds in abey
ance the Manchurian questions, con
cerning which Russia declines to treat,
on the ground that they are matters
between her and China, until she as
certains whether satisfactory arrange
ments are reachable regarding Korea.
Russia contends that Japan's treaty
rights In Manchuria were secured from
China and stand on the same footing
as those of the United States and the
other powers.
Russia's reply to the latest Japanese
proposition is still unsent.. When, it
is framed it will not be : in' the nature
of an ultimatum, but it may lead to
counter- proposals. It is possible that
the end may be a new RussV- Japanese
treaty covering Korea. 'â¢
Regarding the' suggestion that 'the
United" States" may ask Russia to sub
mit the question of the evacuation of
Manchuria to The Hague tribunal, It is
pointed out at the Foreign Office and
in diplomatic circles that, political is
sues being involved, it is impracticable
and would be unprecedented' to â¢ leave

by the Associated Press correspondent
at Paris that the Governments of Rus

agreement as to the Far .Eastern diffi
culties, and giving the basis of the
probable agreement, aroused intense
interest In London. The inclination in
most -well-informed quarters is to be
lieve that an agreement insuring the
peaceful solution of the difficulties is
on the e,ve of arrangement. Even

the accuracy of the details. Viceroy

tions had reached a stage- where no se

thousands of dollars paid to Mr. Has
sell's concern during the last six

"The contents of this report as , far
as the statement of any. facts are con

to demand any notice, if it were not for

the public." ,
Douglas Young, in charge of the work
of the Hasst;ll Audit Company at the

last night:
"If Mr. Farnham or any other Public
Administrator that preceded him will
permit an examination of his accounts,

other San Francisco daily newspaper,
we will make the examination without
cost to Mr. Farnham, to any of . his
predecessors or to the city, provided
that a report of the result of the 'ex
amination be made public through the
press.
"This statement is made because of
the public utterances of the Public Ad
ministrator to the effect that the Grand
Jury had experted his books and found
them correct, and that he challenged
investigation." if
"Under this section it is .plain that
nothing has to be paid to the County
Clerk until there is something in the
estate with which to pay. yet Mr. Has
sell, with great assumption of legal
knowledge, asserts that the law as here
written Is not a law, and that the
Judges and County Clerks, and Public
Administrators in this and other coun
ties who have for many years (accord
ing to his own admission) followed the
law as expressed in section 1741 have
been really violating the law. -

"It may be proper to remark here
that the law, as written in section 1741
of the Code of Civil Procedure, governs
the payment of fees into the county
treasury from the estates in the hands
of the Public Administrator, and ex
pressly' places the services of the va
rious officers, myself included, at the
disposal of the "Public Administrator
until such time as the assets and.estate
come into his hands.
"His report also rehashes the asser
tion that he made six months ago that
there is 1 $1277 50 due to the city from
my office. He artfully endeavors to
make it appear, that this is due from,
me personally, whereas, any one famil

knows that if due at all it is due from
the estates in my charge and not from
me personally.

"To work union and non-union men
in the mines is impossible. Men who
refused to join the. union would be in

have not destroyed property, provided
they will eive up their union cards.
That Is as far as we can go."
Attorney General Breeden, who re

President Roosevelt to-day received a
telegram from the executive board of
the Western Federation of Miners,
strongly urging him to protect the
right of the miners who had been or
dered to leave the Telluride district in
Colorado, on penalty of imprisonment.
The matter Is In the hands of the State
authorities of Colorado, and It does not
appear at this time that the Federal
Government, through the President,
can properly take action on it. -The
Secretary of War, who has been con
sulted by the Colorado authorities, has
expressed the opinion that the Govern
ment cannot interfere legally in the
trouble in the Telluride district at the
present Juncture. Among officials who
have considered the subject it is be
lieved that the rights of the miners will
be protected fully by the courts.
"There is an unsettled conldtlon at
the coal mines, both in the Trinidad or
Southern district and the Northern dis
trict, which may develop into such dis
order as to require the use of troops.
Should this occur while the whole
available force of State troops is em
ployed at Cripple Creek and Telluride,
which is now the case, I think Federal
troops will then be needed. At pres
ent. I understand, no violence is being
offered in the coal districts."
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.âMajor-Gen
eral Bates, who was sent to Colorado to
investigate the difficulties in the Crip
ple Creek and Telluride mining dis
tricts, has submitted his report to Lieu
tenant General Young, the chief of
staff of the army, and it was published
to-day. The report is dated Denver,
November 29, and says:
"I find that the disturbances at Crip
ple Creek and Telluride amounted to
insurrection against the State of Colo
rado; in that mining, milling and other
business was suspended there by rea
son of intimidation, threats and vio
lence, and that the civil officers were
not able to, or did not, maintain order.
"The militia of the State has been
employed and is now employed at
Cripple Creek and Telluride. I think
the employment of the State troops
necessary, at both these ponta, and that
they are now giving proper protection
to life and property. At Cripple Creek
work has been resumed at the mines
and at Telluride one mine has resumed
operations, and owners inform me they
propose to open other mines as rapidly
as they can secure workmen. It is
probable that military guards will have
to be maintained at the points men
tioned for some time, but I understand
it is the intention to reduce the force
as rapidly as circumstances will war
rant, though in my opinion no material
reduction can safely be made for some
months. At this time United States
troops are not needed.
General Bates Says Colorado Militia
Is Maintaining Order.
REGXTLABS ABE NOT NEEDED.
The Actors' Union has established
headquarters in the Emma Spreckels
building. â¢
Advices from the north are to the
effect that more than 5000 men have
been thrown out of employment In
the logging -camps and it is feared
that they will invade this city during
the winter months.
It is expected that the strike among
the paper-box makers will soon be set
tled. The men demand a shorter
working day and their employers will
in all probability accede to this de
mand rather than allow the strike to
continue.
It was reported yesterday that three
more firms had joined forces against
the striking cloakmakers and that the
battle will be fought to an end. It Is
rumored that the local firms have im
ported a large number of cloakmakers
from the East and that they will ar
rive in a few days to take the places
of the strikers. The rumor has not
vet been verified.
The Bartenders' Union has added a
new clause to its by-laws, whereby
the men will be allowed to work only
ten hours. It Is said that the mat
ter will be brought to the attention
of the saloon-keepers -soon and a gen
eral demand will then be made for a
ten-hour workday. All members who
appear behind a bar without a union
button will be fined SI for the of
fense.

SAN DOMINGO. Dec. 2.â General
Auguistin Morales, President of the
Revislonal Government of Santo Do

with United States Minister Powell,
during which he demanded that Senor
Galvan, former Minister of Finance,
should be withdrawn from the board
appointed by the Government of Presi
dent Wos y Gil to arbitrate the claims
of the Santo Domingo Improvement
Company.
Minister Powell declined to grant
this demand and supplemented his
declination by the statement that the
United States Government could only
recognize the provisional Government
of-Santo Domingo when it agreed to
observe all the acts and engagements
entered into by former Governments
with the United States. It is reported
here that a disturbance, headed by
General Roso, has broken out at Bara
lona, on the south coast of the island.
The general situation remains un
settled and there have been many
demonstrations of dissatisfaction.
It is rumored that several places In
the north of the Island are by no
means tranquil and it is considered
desirable that the United States gun
boat Newport should remain here.
The financial condition of the pro
visional Government is a desperate
one.
"At the present time officers of 'the
State of Colorado, under the guise and
pretext of enforcing law, have ordered
a large number of reputable and self
sustaining citizens and residents to
leave Telluride, Colo., under penalty of
being imprisoned or otherwise severely
dealt with. These citizens are residents
and are not guilty of any crime against
the laws of the State or the United
States. The constitution and laws of
the United States pertaining to cfvil
rights are being flagrantly violated, and
we call upon you, under the civil rights
statutes and under section 19SS of the
Revised Statutes of the United States,
to investigate conditions prevailing
there and give to these persons who
have been so outraged the protection
guaranteed to them by the law of the
land." â¢
Miners has sent the following telegram
to President Roosevelt:
"There is no reason for any friotion.
We are, on the contrary, actuated by a
common desire for party success' and
increased votes, and propose unitedly to
work to that end."
Senator Platt said to-night that all
participants in the conference had
agreed in pronouncing Bruce's manage
ment most admirable and that Bruce
was asked to remain. The Senator
said:
. "The efforts of the Democratic press
to stir up sedition in the Republican
party and to disrupt the friendly rela
tions which have so long existed be
tween Its leaders have be.en unavailing
and the unpleasant rumors of enmity
between the Governor and myself ought
to be set at rest."
NEW YORK, Dec. 2.â Governor Odell
late this afternoon announced the .res
ignation of M. Lynn Bruce Jrom the
chairmanship of the Republican Com
mittee of New York County. . Bruce
was urged to remain by Odell, who as
sured him of his hearty support, but he
said that the pressure of private duties
rendered his retirement imperative.
The announcement of Bruce's resig
nation came as the climax of a day of
conferences participated in by the Gov
ernor, Senator Platt, Colonel Dunn,
chairman of the Republican State Com
mittee, Bruce and others. After these
conferences Governor Odell. Issued .. a
statement, saying that conclusions sat
isfactory to all were reached, and
added:
WASHINGTON, I>eo. 2.â The annual
report of Fourth Assistant Postmaster
General Bristow for the fiscal year end
ed June 30 last makes- the following
recommendations: An appropriation
to construct Inspectors' lookouts' in
postofflces wherever necessary in the
opinion of tha Postmaster General;
that the interstate commerce law be
amended so as to prohibit common car
riers from aiding and abetting In the
green goods, lottery or any other
scheme carried on partly by mail and
partly by common carrier, in violation
of the postal laws; that special agents
and postofflce inspectors be hereafter
designated rural agents; that the
provision that rural carriers shall -not
be prohibited from doing an express
business be repealed; that the maxi
mum of a rural carrier be increased
to $750 per annum for a route of twen
ty-five miles or more In length, and
the enactment of a law requiring -as
sistant postmasters, cashiers and other
employes to give bonds to postmasters
direct, and holding postmasters re
sponsible under their own bonds.
There are now in â¢ operation ~ 19,390
rural free delivery routes. It is esti
mated that 3360 additional routes can
be established out of the appropriation
now available, making 22,678 which will
be in operation or ordered established
by March 1, 1904. Bristow's report
says:
"An Investigation, which Is still ' in
progress, has shown that for a number
of y^ars supplies for the free delivery
service have not been purchased with
an eye to the public Interests. Both
in the matter of quality and the cost
of equipment the ruling has been in
dividual gain. This applies to articles
furnished under regular contract, such
as street collection boxes and carriers*
satchels, as well as to those bought In
the open- market under the exigency
privilege, which has been abused. Fa
vored 'contractors, abetted by a trusted
but- unfaithful official, have corrupted
the public service. An early and thor
ough reformation will be. undertaken
along the' line of service of equipment
with the prospect of improved service
at a reduced 'cost. Fraudulent con
tracts have beeen abrogated. , In the
reletting of contracts competition will
have fair and free play."

PARIS. Dec. 2.â During the discus
sion of the budget in'tbe Chamber of
Deputies to-day M. Rouvier, Minister
of Finance, replying to general criti
'cisms of the. Government, declared that
the conditions of the national credit
were most satisfactory. The fall In
rentes, he said, was chiefly due to gen
eral causes, wbich had also affected
the other nations of Europe, but in the
absence of certain local causes would
have had a* less effect dn France. M.
Rouvier said that unscrupulous poli
ticians had striven to Increase the feel
ing of distrust with a view to discredit
ing the Government. The deficit in the
budget, he admitted, had also bad an
unfavorable effect on rentes. Whether
a loan would be issued depends upon
the policy of the Chamber.
At present" the Government has no
intention of floating a loan, but if the
Chamber refused to supply the Gov
ernment with needful resources," there
by compelling the Issue of 59,000,000 of
short-time obligations, the floating of
a loan might be found necessary.
Regarding withdrawals from the sav
ings banks, "the Minister pointed out
that these withdrawals were excessive
only in reactionary districts, from
which fact he Invited the members of
the Chamber to draw their conclusions.

recommended that the wishes of Ho

is required, against 154,000 cubic yards
in the couth channel.
A contract has already been let for

It is believed that early in the season
the improvements in the inner harbor
will be completed.
The citizens of Hoqulam, which la

ening of the north channel, by which
a depth of sixteen feet could be main
tained on the water front. Other in
terests demanded that a channel should
be dredged on the south side of tfie

Special Dispatch to" The Call
As affecting the personnel of the
navy, Admiral Taylor refers to the need
of more' officers as engineers. Atten
tion also Is called to a defect which Ad
miral Taylor says is common to most
military service, whether -at. sea or on
land, namely, the advanced age at
which officers reach the more impor
tant commands. The duty of com
manding a battleship and fleets of bat
tleships/ he says, is one which requires,
together with a large experience and
ability, the energy and nervous endur
ance which Is found as a rule among
men much younger than those who will
command our battleships and fleets for
some years to come. As a remedy for
the present defect. he urges the retire
ment of officers when they have
reached a certain age in a certain
grade. , He suggests that an officer of
60 5 years of â¢ age, ,who has not attained
the' rank of captain, retire, and that a
captain who at-56 has not reached the
grade of rear; admiral, retire. .After
urging an addition to the service of
thirty lieutenant commanders and fifty
lieutenants, Admiral Taylor says that
at present lieutenants are doing the
duty which "should be done by lieuten
ant commanders. : , .
Regarding the t creation ofi a general
staff, Admiral Taylor says:
"The present organization of the de
partment is inadequate because it fails
to co-ordinate the efforts of the several
bureaus to" a common end, and nowhere
fixes responsibility under the Secretary
for -the general efficiency of the fleet
andi its preparedness for war. The ne
cessity, continues for some authorita
tive 'direction under the Secretary of
the Navy of the general: affairs of the
fleet as a military organization."
PERSONNEL OF THE NAVY.
The report says the Asiatic station
needs six cruisers of an Improved
Olympla type and four cruisers of the
scout cruiser type, of which latter two
can now be provided. It is also urged
that two smaller gunboats or large
launches be provided immediately for
service in Chinese rivers for the protec
tion of American interests where the
present gunboats cannot operate owing
to their size.
Admiral Taylor expresses the opinion
that a large number of cruisers will be
very necessary during the next few
years. Admiral Taylor treats at great
length on the subject of desertion,
showing that for the year 1903 the per
centage was 12.9. Among the various
reasons assigned by officers, as well as
the men themselves, he says, are dis
content with the food, discomforts as
to sleeping accommodations, confine
ment on board ship without . frequent
liberty to visit shore, harshness In lan
guage and bearing on the part of of
ficers-toward the crew,, the disappoint
ment .of the recruit, who believed that
sea service was a pleasant" and easy
thing,. and -the 'restless spirit existing
among some of the men. He estimates
that the desertions on account of food,
close quarters, restricted liberty to go
ashore and causes incident to j the men
them'selves,' including â¢' love of ' change,
at riot above 9 per cent of the force,
and says when desertions go above that
percentage departments should exam
ine closely the causes which produce
the increase. Admiral Taylor believes
that the evil of desertion in the com
ing year will show signs of a steady
diminution, due to the many allevia
tions which have been introduced and
to the Rewards now offered to the men
who remain in the service. , .fÂ»V:<
Washington; bee. 2.â The annual
report of Admiral H. C. Taylor, chief
of the bureau of navigation; recom
mends the creation of a general staff
In the navy, the appointment of two
vice admirals, one for the Asiatic sta
tion and one for the North Atlantic
station, a material increase in the num
ber of officers and the. addition of a
number of ships to the navy.
An increase in the number of cruisers,,
forming the Caribbean squadron to
eight is urged, five of an improved
Olympla type and three specially 11 con
structed light draught vessels for river
work."
Admiral Taylor calls attention to the
irregular character of the training
squadron, and urges in the interests of
true economy the building of training
vessels which would be useful in war.
The construction of eight such vessels
is recommended, to be of the size of
the San Francisco, with a sea speed of
sixteen knots and with large coal en
durance, but with such reduction" in
armament as to be capable of berthing
a large number.
For the European station six new
cruisers are recommended. On the
Asiatic station Admiral Taylor says
the situation demands a battleship
squadron, a cruiser squadron and a
squadron of- small vessels. Admiral
Taylor concurs in the recommendation
of Admiral Evans that the principal
naval station in the Philippines be es
tablished at Olongapo, Subig Bay.
MOEE SHIPS FOR ASIA.
The scientists 1 " of the agricultural de
partment of the University of / Cali
fornia who have been conducting the
campaign against the codlin moth re
turned to-day from eight months of
warring at Watsonville, the favorite
summer resort of the destructive in
sect. These investigators are entirely
Justified in saying that \ they were
wholly successful in the campaign, for
the loss of fruit through the codlin
moths' ravages this year was only 5
per cent, against 40 per cent for last
year, making a net saving â¢ of 35 per
cent.
The work was carried on at various
times by Professor C. W. Woodworth,
Warren T. Clark, W. H. Voick and J.
S. Hunter, though these men were not
in the field all the time. The flnishlng
up work was done by. Mr. Volck,' who
returned to-day with Mr. Hunter and
furnished the data connected with It.
All of the appropriation of $2925, which
was provided by Monterey and Santa
Crux' counties, was used in the experi
ments. ' A hundred orchards were
treated, the larger part of the work
being carried on in the Pajaro Valley,
the principal apple region of. the State.
Now that the moth has been almost
exterminated the scientists will turn
their attention to the Invention of a
-new spray. It was found that the ar
senical sprays used this summer caused
the leaves to drop and the fruit to be
come smaller, so that a: less injurious
spray must be found.
By far the work most interesting to
the non-agricultural world was carried
on by Mr. .Hunter, whose endeavors
were directed toward discovering the
economic value of birds to the orchard
ists and whether they eat any percep
tible per cent of the codlin moth or any
other destroying insect. During ,. his
eight months' stay in the valley Mr.
Hunter killed 1300 birds of different
kinds and sent their stomachs to
Washington for examination by Dr. F.
E. L. Beal, chief ornithologist -of . the
Department of Agriculture. | It was in
tended that if .the birds were destruc
tible to insects to encourage their pro
pogation. Â¦â¢â¢-Â». - .
1 The examination of the. stomachs of
the black srrosbeak by Dr.., Beal re
vealed that. 90 per centf of the insect
food in them was injurious to Â¦ ' crops!
Out of this 90 per cent 14 per cent was
found to be codlin- moth, pupae. In
some cases there.. were. 100 per cent of
codlin moth, while in ethers. there was
only fi per Â¦cBnfand^a: large per cent r of
caterpillars. â¢ Â¦ . .
Of the fifty species taken the- gros
beak was found to be the most destruc
tive of insects and the linnet the least.
Mr. Hunter finds that none of theblrds
are as injurious to trees as at first sup
posed, and that they ought to be pro
tected ,-mpre, -especially iat;the nesting
time. â¢ â¢ ..' ".' - .... 'Â¦"â¢Â¦' ;'",'. ','.'* '"." ..'.'*. ~X

Goldstein's' body -was interred this
morning in Mountain View Cemetery.
The parents and , a sister. Miss Annie
Goldstein, followed the hearse tot the
cemetery, where. the Rev. Adolph â¢' T.
Jatho conducted a brief service.
"For a while he attended Woodbury
College in Los Angeles, but in March
of this year left the college before he
had completed his course. Kiniry had
been around the house and had induced
my son to leave. , Before I knew, it he
had packed my boy's 'clothes in , his
trunk. My son told me he was going
to San Francisco with Kiniry. I begged
him to stay with me, but he told me he
was going and I could not Induce him
to remain at hpme.
"In June I made up my mind to go
to San Francisco and was preparing
for the journey, when Frank and Kin
iry walked into the house. My son said
he had been working at Redington's.
He stayed around home for three
months and Kiniry was there a great
deal. At last I said Frank ought to
find a position. I didn't think Kiniry
was a good companion for the boy, be
cause he was roaming about too much.
"When they left In September it was,
as I was told, for Frank to return to
Redington's, where, he had said he was
earning $50 a month..
"That Sunday he' left was the; last
time I saw him- alive."
The last letter he wrote; was "from
Oakland. The one before that; was
from San Francisco.* I remember he
said in It: 'Mother," if it is God's .will
I will soon be with you again and
everything will be O;K.' 'Â¦'. Â¦'Â¦ ..-.
"Such things, as these in his letters
disturbed me, although not until" after
his death did I know positively that
for. months I had been deceived."
Other testimony offered was that of
Charles Kutz and Fred Kutz, Miss
Daisy Nolan and Policeman J. M.
Cockerton as to the finding ,of Gold
stein's body and as to circumstances
surrounding the shooting; Dr. . J.- M.
Kane, the autopsy surgeon, "and Eu
gene S. Van Court, who took Policeman
Smith's dying statement at the Receiv
ing Hospital.
Subscriptions to the testimonial fund
Intended ' to raise ; the mortgage of
$2800 on the late 'Patrolman Smith's
home are being received at the Central
Bank and at the Oakland newspaper
offices.
"Kiniry's mother and himself 'came'
direct to our house at 204 Turk street,
San Francisco, from St. Louis. She
left the boy there when he was about
17 years old. He. wofked in a drug
store on Market street. But he left me
and went to his aunt in Vallejq, where;
he learned carpentering. Kiniry used
to visit my house frequently until I
lÂ«f t San Francisco In 1901. My eon was
working for three years In the Phila
delphia Shoe Store on Third street,
and after that 1 sent him to Heald's
Business College. Soon "after I went to
Los Angeles my boy came to me there.
He worked eight or nine months as
bookkeeper for Albert Maulhardt at
Oxnard and returned to Los Angeles'in
December of last year. . . ' . â¢Â¦ .
KINIBY'S BAD INFLUENCE.
"You will no doubt be surprised when
you receive this to hear that I have
moved. I am living with a private
family and have my breakfast with
them in the morning. I think I am go
ing up to Sacramento Sunday, and will
be up there a few. days. â¢ â¢. * i *. â¢
You say that I will not give you 'a
chance to see me in 'Frisco. I did hot
know you were coming up here, mother.
I don't see why you keep worrying
about my position. I am all right. The
only thing is I am keeping en the move.
â¢."Â¦'.? â¢ â¢ I have not seen the Maurers
-for over two weeks. You don't know
how I have to" keep going. ' I haven't
.much chance to go around to , see any
one."
Of her acquaintance with Kiniry, Mrs.
Greiner said: Â¦'
"My son had been at home about
three months before he left me. He
wrote to me every week always from
San Francisco, except the last time,
when he wrote me from Oakland. His
last letter was what aroused my sus
picions, because he said he had to move
about so much. I could not understand
if he was working in Ban Francisco
why he should move to Oakland. Not
a word did he ever say about Kiniry.
Not until after- my son's* death did I
know the truth."
Coroner Mehrmann read extracts as
follows from the last letter Mrs. Grei
ner received from her son:
Justifiable homicide -was the verdict
of the Coroner's Jury to-night in the
case of Frank J. Goldstein. By strong
declaration the Jury found that Gold
stein had come to his death at the
hands of Policeman James H. Smith,
who was attacked while discharging
his duty In attempting to arrest Gold
stein and Klnery. The Jury eald:
"We find that death was caused by
hemorrhage, due to a gunshot wound
inflicted by Officer James H. Smith,
who, while discharging ' hia duty as a
peace officer In attempting to arrest
said Goldstein and one David Klniry.
was by them murderously attacked
and justifiably defended himself there
from. T. J. Foster, foreman; I. AriX,
J. S. Dermitt, C. M. Keep, G. M. Lit
tle, J. A- McLean. A. K. Percival.
In the light of the revelations made
by young Goldstein's death the story
related to-night by his grief-burdened
mother was peculiarly sad. Mrs.
Greiner recounted to the Jury her
fears, suspicions and anxieties about
her boy; her efforts to prevent him
from associating with Kiniry, and at
last her determination to come to San
Francisco two weeks ago, so strong
had become her Idea that all was not
as it should be with her wayward son.
"I have learned all too late that he
had been deceiving me," said Mrs.
Greiner. "He told me when he left
home in September with Kiniry that
he was going to return to work with
Redington & Co. In San Francisco. I
know now that it was a deception."

The Board of Public Works decided
yesterday that it is unable for the pres
ent to grant the petition of the Labor
ers' Protective Union that the wages of
laborers in the board's employ be raised
from $2 50 to $3 per day. Secretary
Joyce of the union appeared before the
board and urged that the Increase be
allowed under the opinion of the City
Attorney, who holds that the-Board of
Works has the power to fix the wages
of its employes.
The board specified three reasons for
denying the petition, although it ex
pressed its sympathy with the request
of the union, which It held to be de
serving. The reasons assigned Â¦were:
First â Insufficiency of the appropria
tion for wages in the present fiscal
year's budgeT would not permit of the
increase asked for.
Second â If the increase were allowed
the board would be compelled to lay
off a certain nun*ber of laborers to
make it up, and this the board refuses
to do, as It is not deemed to be a bene
fit to the petitioners!
Thirdâ The raise is prevented by the
charter provision which says that em
ployes of the city shall not be paid
higher compensation than that paid by
private concerns for similar work.
RULING SCALE OF WAGES. â¢
On the last point Joyce was unable
to present evidence that - the ruling
scale of laborers' wages is $3 per day.
Joyce was urged to appear before the
Board of Supervisors when next year's
budget Is being made up and have a
sufficient appropriation incorporated
therein to pay all laborers employed by
the city $3 per day, beginning July 1,
1904. *
The board rescinded a permit hereto
fore granted to the California Cement
Company to construct a temporary
roadway on Nee street, between Nine
teenth and Twenty-first streets. Action
was taken on the report of City En
gineer Grunsky, who found that the
contracting company had deposited
material so that at points it extends
above the official. grade, and that the
street was being used as a dump rather
tha,n improving its condition. The
board directed the company to level
the surface where material has been
deposited- in, mounds.
OPPOSE GRADE CHANGES.
Dr. Emma L. Merrltt. executrix of
the Sutro estate, Â¦ which has filed a pro
test against the proposed grade changes
in the Byfield tract, appeared before
the board and asked that action there
on be deferred for one week. Mrs. Mer
ritt stated that she desired to take up
each particular grade change, as the
Sutro estate would favor only those
which would not damage its property.
The request was granted.
T. G. "Crothers and Sol Getz addressed
the board regarding their petition to
grade H street from Forty-fifth to For
ty-eighth avenues, but action was post
poned to give the petitioners an oppor
tunity to confer with General Man
ager Chapman oC. the United Railroads
regarding the lowering of the street
car tracks on the blocks described.
Attorney Shadburne, representing the
Paullst Fathers, asked the board to re
consider its intention to pave with ba
salt blocks the roadway of Dupont
street from California to Sacramento I
streets. Although j the petition â¢ was
taken under advisement it Is not likely
that it will be granted, as the charter
requires such a pavement ' on blocks
whose gradient exceeds 6 per cent.

.it would solve the problem of space
and arrangement of ferry-boats to the

; At the preseat time the Key Route

Bills to the amount of $11,236 05 were
ordered paid.

Brandenstein asked Irwin's" attorney,
G. Gunzendorfer, if Irwln had dis
charged Pierce, and Gunzendorfer 're-
Brandenstein. McClellan and Eggers
were in favor of declaring Irwin incom
petent on the second charge, but they
were in the minority.
, On the finding that Irwin was incom
petent because he has had in his em
ploy a deputy poundmaster named
Pierce who had taken money to allow
cattle to roam at large illegally, the
committee was divided and no recom
mendation was made. The evidence
that Irwin did not know of Pierce's
v.ronsrdolng saved him on that point.
PIERCE NOT DISCHARGED.
The committee found that Irwin was
guilty of neglect of duty in permitting
the use of unofficial receiot books not
warranted by law, the stubs of which
had never been compared with th'e of
ficial receipts and had afterward been
destroyed, so that no comparison could
be made.
The committee voted against the first
finding that Irwln was guilty of neglect
of duty In not impounding large stock,
as he had testified that he could not do
so with the reduced appropriation. â¢
The proposed recommendation that
the pound be placed under the man
agement of the Society tor the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals was not
considered in view of the committee's
vote against Irwin's removal.
The recommendation that the crrdin
ance be so amended as to take the ap
pointing power for the position out of
the hands of the Mayor and vest it
in the Board of Supervisors was'adopt
ed. The plan is to place the manage
ment of the tfound under the supervi
sion of the Police Committee. Branden
stein deolared that the ordinance was
invalid. He also said that the minor
ity v.-ouid submit a supplementary re
port requesting the removal of Irwin. "Â¦
VOTE ON FIRST FINDING.
The joint Committee on Finance, Po
lice and License of the Board of Super
visors yesterday defeated by a tie vote
a proposed recommendation to Mayor
Schmitz that Poundmaster H. O. Irwln
be removed from his post for alleged
neglect of duty. The vote on the recom
mendation was: Ayesâ Brandenstein,
McClellan. Eggers and Loughery â 4.
Noes â Boxton, Wilson, Rea and BÂ«nt â I.
The Grand Jury will be called to
examine Into County Clerk Bert Ma
hony's method of conducting his of
fice. The charge of juggling with the
salary roll of the office made against
Mahony Tuesday by several of hia
deputies and copyists will be called
to the attention of the inquisitorial
body by Harry Barbee, one of the
clerks . in, Mahony*s employ, who
claims to . have lost several weeks'
wages through Mahony's efforts to
stretch his monthly allowance to such
an extent that he could carry on the
rolls nearly every person to whom he
was indebted and his political friends.
"I am going to bring my case to the
attention' of the Grand Jury," said
Barbee^yesterday, a few moments af
ter ;Mahony had informed him that
he was % no longer in his employ. "I
see no other way of making the Coun
ty Clerk pay me the money I honestly
earned. I worked during the entire
month of November, as the records
will show, and did not receive a cent.
I kept quiet because I expected that
it would be made up to me. I worked
every day. during October, and instead
of receiving .a salary of $150, es I was
promised, got only '$100. That was
just twenty days' pay, and I can prove
that I was- entitled to thirty. I was
here every day attending to my work.
I 'made a roar,' but It did not do me
any good. The trick was repeated last
month, 1 and now I am going to get the
money .or" know the reason why. I
suppose I ought to consider mystlf
very lucky, for several of the boya
who worked every day, as can readily
be shown, did not get a cent."
â¢Mayor Schmitz stated yesterday
that the fact that a writ of injunc
tion had been issued some months ago
by % Judge Hebbard, restraining him
from interfering with the County
Clerk's office, would prevent him from
taking any action in the latest fecan
dal in the office. His Honor said\that
If he had his way he would have* re
moved Mahony at that time, but he
was powerless ! to do anything in the
matter, owing to the restraining or
der, which was made perpetual.
From figures furnished yesterday to
the Board of Public Works by the Bu
reau of Buildings It Is learned that dur
ing: the eleven months beginning 1 Janu

Isabella Gonzales, the Porto Rlcan
â¢woman who, opqri attempting to land
in New York in the summer of 1902,
Â¦was taken into custody l>y Immigra
tion Commissioner, Williams as an
immigrant who was likely to become
a public" charge. :? " 0-" 3
The brief is Ih the woman's inter
est and is an orgument'against depor
tation, based largely upon the. theory
thatfhe is not an alien. The case is
r/msldered important, as upon its de
cision will" depend the disposition of
jflinhe Spanish islanders who -were in
existence at the time the islands were

PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 2.â A tene

a complaint made by Italian merchants
and bankers, who said they had re
ceived blackmailing: letters and had
been threatened with death should they
refuse to comply with demands for
money. Each of the fifteen men ar
rested was armed with two revolvers

At the hearing to-day onÂ« of the men
admitted that he and his companions
were members of the Mafia, and that
they are in communication with simi

BpÂ«cJal ' Dispatch to Th* Call.
GARNETT, Kans., Dec. 2.â Isaac E.
Squires, a stockman of Bishop, Cal.,
has found a lost brother, Albert AI.
Squires, In thla city. Five months ago
they were in the cattle* business 'to
gether. Albert started in July for Fort
Smith, Ark., to vjsit relatives. He
reached Reno, Nev., and was there
drugged and robbed, but he readily ob
tained more money and continued hia
journey. Several- weeks after his'ar
rival at Fort Smith his- mind became
unbalanced and his Â¦ brother. Isaac,
came Cast to take, him home. When
he arrived at Fort Smith Albert
seemed to have entirely recovered" a"nd
the two started home by way of Cof
feyville, Kans., where they visited otli
er relatives. They left Coffeyville with,
Albert apparently in sound mind, but
when Isaac awakened in Kansas City
the next morning hia brother was gone.
Hia berth had not been occupied and
no one had seen him after the train left
Yates Center. Isaac returned to Cali
fornia without him.
Three weeks ago the Sherlfl of this
county arrested a man supposed to be
a tramp, who had taken possession of
a farmer's strawstack near Garnett.
When searched $3 in silver was found
In his pockets, but the money was
black with smoke and had evidently
passed through the fire. The Sheriff
believed he had captured a safe blower
and held him for investigation.
The prisoner called for a preacher
and to him confessed that he had com-'
mitted a crime In California and said
officers were on his trail. He gave the
name of Albert Squires and told ] the
preacher that a reward had been- of
fered by the Sheriff at Bishop for hia
arrest. So rationally did he talk that
it was not suspected that he was de
mented.
A message was sent to California and
the reply came back that he waa .not
wanted for a crime, but to hold him
until his. relatives could arrive. The
message also said that Squires should
have about $200 In his pockets. - . -Â¦
A search revealed the fact that the
demented man had built a fire wblle
tramping about and had used hia
money for fuel. The rim of hia pock -
etbook and several silver dollars wefe
found In the ashes. .,:*: "?;
Isaac Squires started home* with his
brother to-night. He believes that the
latter's condition is due entirely to'hla
experience in Reno, Nev., where he waa
drugged. f r . /--. ".->.*"

sums up the November movement as
follows:
The tales In the 100 vara section have in
creased In number, but have decreased In
amount as compared with last month. The
Western Addition and Mission dhstricts hold
the same good average as they have shown
all this year, while the Outside Land section
shows considerable Increase this month and
has -teen doing so for several months. Very
nearly as much business is being done now as
there was done during the first half of this

MAY BUILD WING.
Some time ago the California Com
missioners applied on two sep
arate occasions to the authorities
at St. Louis to have greater space than
had been originally allotted in the edu
cation building. Both applications were
met with the official statement that
more space had already been demanded
by States and by foreign countries than
there was in the education building,
notwithstanding Its ample . area of
seven acres. This fact was made known
to President Wheeler and the faculty
of the University of California.
Yesterday the situation was regarded
In educational circles as very interest
ing. The question was raised whether
the University of California would be
represented at St. Louis if it could not
have ample room. Several alternatives
were suggested In case sufficient space
was not provided In the ': education
building for a collective exhlbltl One
was that the several unique features
of the university might be shown sep
arately In different buildings; for In
stance, the mining show of the uni
versity misht be made in the mining
building, the Lick Observatory show In
another building, the agricultural ex
hibit in the agriculture building, and
so on. "
The belief was current that this would
not prove to be satisfactory to the uni
versity people, 1 for the effect of their
demonstration of the educational'facil
ities connected: with the University of
California would be practically dissi
pated by having the exhibit segregated
into units. . Commissioner Filcher said
last evening that if all other means
failed it might ;be possible to provide
room for the University of California
to make a .' collective show on "a mag
nificent scale by having an additional
wing constructed, on the California
State building .on the exposition
grounds. He thought that this might
possibly be accomplished. . -. ;

he is to - enter the employ of a big car

that the position of master car builder

the work of that office would be made

OTHER MESSAGES GO.
President Wheeler of the University
of California and members of the fac
ulty of the university have determined
that, If possible, the State's great edu
cational establishment at Berkeley
shall be represented largely at the St.
Louis Exposition. But there is a hitch
regarding the space that is available
in the exposition Education building.
This structure covers seven acres.
Preceding, expositions have â¢ housed
educational shows in buildings de
voted in part to other uses, like the
Fine Arts building or something simi
lar. ,
Now the space in the St. Louis Ex
position Education building has all
been taken and there is a demand for
more. President Wheeler and his edu
cational associates have conferred
with Commissioner Filcher, represent
ing California, and also w-ith Profes
sor Furlong, the head of the' California
sducational department of the St.
Louis show. As a result a message
as long as an ordinary business let
ter has been sent by President Wheeler
to H. J. Rogers, chief of the depart
ment of education at St. Louis, in
which it set forth that the University
of California desires to make a
unique and extensive exhibition and
that to do this considerable space is
desired, 1500 square feet in all. ,

.tory decree of divorce to Bessle # H.

As in former years, Colonel George
French and Mrs. French and General
Secretary George Wood, with the of
ficials, are laying out their programme
for the Christmas day dinner, which
will be given at Odd Fellows' Hall.
Plans are also being formulated by
whicfr applicants will receive a good
basket dinner, so that they may cook
it in their homes. Each basket will
be amply provided with the good
things of the season.
The Salvation Army's solicitors have
each been armed with a duly author
ized card bearing the name of George
French, the provincial officer, and the
address of the headquarters.
The officials will prepare and pro
vide dinner for 2000. which will be
quite an undertaking. The dinner last
year was appreciated by a great num
ber, who would have been compelled
to have passed the day with but a
meager meal but for the. army's hos
pitable preparation. The army of
ficials therefore once more count upon
the ever ready generosity of citizens to
aid them in -softening the hard lines
of life and bringing good cheer on
Christmas day to those weighed down
with utter misfortune.
All donations, cash or materials, will
be received at the army headquarters.
Checks and money orders should be

much as gone In the neighborhood of

â¢There are two kinds of
emulsions of cod liver oil â
Scott's and all the others.
Not one of the latter is as
valuable as Scott's Emulsion
and there's a reason for it
Only the purest ingredients
enter our Emulsion and its
quality never Varies. That is
why it helps when all others
fail.
There's not much oil in
the market now; it's scarce

oil and other inferior oils are â¢
cheap and plentiful. TKat's
why you can buy so many

MR. SHAFROTH of -Colorado has introduced and
had referred to the Committee on Banking and
Currency a bill to authorize the issuance of cur
rency redeemable in bonds of the United States. It
authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the presen
tation of bonds of the United States in amount not ex
ceeding ten million dollars per month,- to issue in lieu
thereof bonds to be known as, currency bonds," in denomi
nations of ten, twenty, fifty, one hundred, five hundred
and one thousand dollars, payable thirty years after
date in the currency stipulated in the surrendered bond,
and bearing, interest at one\per cent per annum. .
These currency bonds are to be issued inamount equal
to the market value of the bonds surrendered â that is to
say, the new issue includes the par value and the premium
on the old. The holder of the currency. bond upon de
positing the same in the treasury shall have issued to him
a currency certificate of like denomination, certifying that
it is secured by such bond, and made .receivable for all
taxes and dues to the Government, and a legal tender for
all private debts, except when otherwise stipulated in the
contract.
The^lan has some original features. It, in effect, re
verses the order of conversion adopted in the case of
the greenbacks upon the resumption of specie, pay
ment. The greenback issue was converted into bonds by
the process of selling bonds for the cash to redeem the
currency. The Shafroth bill proposes now to reverse
that process by converting the bonds into greenbacks
again. But by the.legal tender act of 1862 the greenbacks
rested on the credit of . the Government, and their value
depended on its power to redeem them. - The national
bank law interposed and caused the conversion of the
bonds which redeemed the greenbacks into national bank
currency to the extent of 90 per cent of their par value.
This conversion could be effected only according to the
terms and conditions of the^national banking law, safe
guarding incorporation, extent of credit and kind of se
curity. The Shafroth bilfrin effect, extends this privilege
of converting bonds into currency to any holder of exist
ing issues of United States bonds. It may be done by a
banking corporation, by an individual, by a partnership.
It will be observed that the bill would result in im
mediately, converting the principal and the premium on
bonds into currency. For instance, the new registered fours
are at a premium of 33, so that a holder of that issue for
$100 would receive a currency bond for $133, at one per
cent interest per annum for thirty years, convertible {: at
once into $133 in currency. At the end of thirty years the
new bond would be redeemed by the Government in the
same currency in which the original bond was payable.
As all of our bonds are now payable in gold, the founda
tion of the new currency would be gold, of course.
The plan deserves the study of financiers, and will re
ceive it. If, as is possible, our entire bonded debt were
converted into the new one per cents the whole interest
would be lowered. The national banks do not issue the
full amount of currency warranted by their capital, be
cause the high premium o'n their bonds makes it more
profitable to convert them into cash. Under this proposed
law they would convert principal and premium into cur
rency. . .
â¢ But suppose the bill should work to convert the whole
outstandingbond issue into currency, the immediate ef
fect would be an inflation of the currency by nearly one
billion dollars. That Seems to be the point at which the
scheme becomes dizzy. But its novelty, its assimilation
of the principles of the national banking law and its rever
falof the order of emission and redemption of the green
backs make it worthy of consideration. ', ,

When there was open to woman no
career but matrimony to which any
respect was attached it was natural
that she should marry as she had op
portunity, all the more that she real
ized so little before entering upon it
what matrlmony^meant. It was equal
ly natural that the woman who did not
marry presumably because not chosen
should become an object of pity and
scorn, for by being left she was proved
lacking in those feminine attributes
which attracted menâ she had not been
true to her sex, so to speak. "Thus "old
maid" became a~stijrma to avoid Â¦ at
any cost of one's feelings if one pos-
Eessed more pride than heart; and
many a woman did, and many a wom
an has married not for love or even for
a home- but that on her tombstone
might be written "Wife of." ~It scarce
ly seems that such a motive could in
spire one to so vital a step. Yet it did,
and strongly in the years when wom
en's career was domestic or nothingâ
when, in fact, she was a superfluous
woman If not married.
Even to-day, with all the possibilities
open to the young woman, she will be
heard discussing the respective merits
of Fred or John and weighing one
against the other, exactly as she would
do if a third were to come into the bid
ding. Still, you see. a matter of sale,
and sale no less that it is done under
the guise of law and of respectability.
If a woman is Influenced by, worldly
conditions in her consideration' of a
man's proposal, or if ehe^ goes to him
for any other reason .than that he is
the complement of her, nature, the be
ing who makes her glad she is a wom
an, she sells .herself as truly as if she
did it without the sanction of the law.
There are women who do not marry
because they will not ' marry without
the sentiment that to them is the true
sanctiflcation of the marriage relation.
There have always been such women â
not many of them, for they had to be
strong, enough to walk alone, and'that
Is painful at.best; and" they had not
only to walk alonei but to face scorn
for being braver and than the
average of their sex. v V "V
That many women formerly entered
the marriage* state without any real
drawing toward it is shown by the
eagerness with which women have
turned toward, other, means of support
as these have opened up to them". Noth
ing has ever been Been in social econoni-:
ics like the welcome given by women
to ways of self-support, arid though
the Inrush of the sex Into various lines
has brought Â¦ some evils, it has healed
others,] and the' disturbance is like . the
fermentation in wine, that makes the
mass srobd ' and ultimately clears it.
Even the superficial student of cus
toms knows that the idea of matri
mony as a two-sided affair in which
woman has as much interest as man,
with her individual tastes as much to
be regarded, is scarcely two genera
tions old. Even now marrying Is not
exclusively^ the result of devotion of
man to woman and of woman to man.
Marrying formerly rested wholly with
the man as It yet does among depend
ent women. Probably when the prime
val man rapped \ over the head and
carried off the woman who attracted
him he was showing: as much senti
ment as was needful, and her opinion
was not sought. The girl who ( escaped
such masculine attention was an un
fortunate, despised by her companions
and by- herself, too, that she was al
lowed to walk in safety.
After clubbing went out of style, and
barter became the rule, it was still the
male who selected, and the female who
accepted the result without demur.
With the twentieth century the form
of bartering has changed somewhat,
for do we not see our rich girls be
coming buyers of dukes and "other titled
men riot too proud to be sold In as
open a market as if put up to auction?
Indeed, throughout the world, in civil
ized and uncivilized lands, marriage re
mains more a matter of sale than of
sentiment, but the reaction has started
which will some day make this im
possible.

Superior Judges at. times during
the trial of divorce cases experience
great difficulty In getting from female
witnesses the exact language they claim
to have heard husbands use to their
wives and vice versa. It is" particu

language happens to be of the kind
that in a divorce complaint comes un
der the head of "vile and opprobrious
epithets." y i'r":>i ; ;.' ,
Recently Judge" Murasky spent ful
ly thirty minutes trying to learn from
a female witness the words she said
she heard the defendant in the suit
call the plaintiff. "You will have to
repeat them, madam," finally said the
Judge.
The woman still demurred and then
blushing furiously commenced spell
ing the words alleged to have been
used.
"That will do, madam," said the
court. "You will have to pronounce
them.'' The stenographer will do the
spelling;."
Lesson in Orthography.
Let the sum be sufficient to pay for
clothes and for the countless little ex
tras so dear to the feminine heart.
There is no need for a man to impover
ish himself in order to do this. A com
mon sense talk before marriage 'should
inform him as to how much (or how
little) his future wife needs for spend
ing money, clothing, etc. If he can
meet the demand he should do so. If
not let him figure out how much of his
salary he can afford to give her as an
allowance; and If she is the right sort
of rirl she will usually make it suffice.
Personally, I' began married .life
with the allowance idea. My wife
and I have separate bank accounts.
I have no idea what sum of. money
Fhe has in bank, nor is it any affair of
mine. My sole affair is to see that she
always receives her just allowance
and that she shall be spared the hu
miliation of having to ask me for
money that is rightly hers.
For women are not like men In this
matter of asking for money. If a
man is broke he seldom has any vast
hesitation in "touching;" his best
friend for the wherewithal to tide
over the difficulty. The flush of
ehame does not mount to his brow to
any extent as ; he breathes the plea:
"Say, old chap, can you lend .me
$1Â© till Saturday?"
J3ut with women it is different. They
hate to ask their husbands for money.
At least the best of them do. They
don't seem to realize that the hus
band's vow, "With all my worldly
roods I thee endow," makes his
money as much theirs as his. If they
could be brought to realize that, there
would be /far fewer heartaches. But
?since, apparently, they ca'nnot bring
thpmselves to that wise frame of
mind, I think husbands .should save
them embarrassment by making
them a regrular weekly or monthly al
lowance. . â¢
"Dear," she laterupted, "several
thousand people used to work for just
those wages up to forty years ago.
Only they were called slaves. And
the country "showed its disapproval
of such payment by abolishing that
form of slavery and declaring it ille
gal. You couldn't get any one on
earth to-day to work for you for
board arrd clothes wages. Why" do you
try to force your wife to?"
Whereat, being at heart a sane
man, he began to see light. And
since then they are happy; she prov
ing to be a model housekeeper and
far more than earning the handsome
allowance he giy.es her.
The surprised benedict began ; to
mumble fond nothings concerning a
lifelong devotion, the" love of a good
man, etc. But she cut him short.
"For all that," she said, "I make
fall return in kind.. But what do I get
for being your housekeeper and gen
eral supervisor?"
"You get a good home," he retort
ed, a. little nettled, "and I will see you
have as good .clothes as any woman
you know, and â "
A girl of ray acquaintance was mar
ried a few months ago. On the re
turn from the honeymoon she had the
ensuing little business talk with her
husband. * *
"By the way, dear," she began, "you
know I'm to keep' the house in order,
manage the servants, plan the meals,
entertain your guests, â¢ keep your
clothes in good "condition and do a few
hundred more tasks of the same tri
fling order. What do I get out of all
this?" ' ;. Â¦Â¦'.;Â¦
Men don't realize what an ur.heard
of good bargain a really good wife is.
For the same amount of work (not
done half as well) any paid house
keeper would expect board and lodg
ing and at least $30 a month. Why
grudge your wife the same sum?.
And. I may add, if she is a good
wife, she earns her allowance, no mat
ter how large it may be. ForÂ«the
average housekeeper and homemaker
does w.ork that comes under the head
of "skilled labor" .of the most Bkillful
kind and keeps it up daily for a term
of hours that would cause her expul
sion from any labor union under the
sun. For a man to expect to get such
service and to pay for It merely by
food, lodging .and clothes, is reminis
cent of the famous exchange column
item:" ; -.^
FOR EXCHANGE â One canceled 2-cent etamp.
In perfectly sood ccaditlcn, fcr a diainpnd
tiara, a 24-foot catboard or a corner lot.
So an opinion on that all-important
theme will perhaps be mo.re authorita
tive coming from a man (a husband,
too, of course.) than from a woman.
It is perhaps the only subject con
nected * with, marriagre on which
woman's testimony is not far more
valuable than is "mere man's." : . - Â¦-Â¦
And â as" a "mere man" â as a hus
bandâas a -father â as a person of
average common sense (I hope) and
honesty, I say most unhesitatingly:
â¢ "Every wife should have her own
pocket money." v â¢ .-â¢'
(Copyrtsfct, 1903, by â¢Oeeph B. Bowles.) â¢
. The question, "Shall a wife have a
separate allowance of her own?" must
invariably" be ahswered by a man, by
each woman's husband. His is the
last voice, the final wo;d on the sub
ject (not a too common event in mar
ried life), and all theories pro or con
must vanish before his simple "yes"
or "no."

The Call.â
OUR readers are urged to note the weekly publi
cation in our columns of facts relating to the
production and resources of California. In a re
cent number of the Strand Magazine, London, is an ar
ticle on the pampas plume industry in this State. The
writer, who is an 'Englishman, has visited California, and,
speaking of the effect upon pampas grass of transferring
it from the pampas of the Argentines, he says: "Like
everything else uv California, it was found that the trans
fer of this plant greatly increased its luxuriance of
growth and the beauty and utility of its plumes." "Like
everything else in'California" tells in one phrase the won
derful story of the effect of our soil and sunshine upon
all useful plants.
Our yield of all fruits of the vine and tree is so enor
mous that persons outside the. State are incredulous.
When told the fact that a prune orchard in California has
produced an average of 1100 pounds of fruit per tree in
one season, two trees bearing over one ton," they cannot
comprehend it, for it lies outside of their experience.
When they hear 'of our. usual crop of grapes being ten to
sixteen tons per acre, and that our vines have produced
individual bunches weighing from sixteen to twenty-two
pounds, they "have no personal experience to use as a
standard of judgment. So, when the peach-growers of
Michigan, New Jersey, foeiaware, Maryland and Georgia
are told that in California, the peach tree, for aught we
know, is as long lived as the oak, they refer to their own
experience, which is that the -life of the : tree there is
limited, seldom exceeding ten years, and averaging per
haps seven, and cannot comprehend the reason for the
difference in longevity. But in that very fact lies'an ad
vantage enjoyed* by our peach-growers here. When
orchards have to be regularly replanted, and bearing time
has to be waited for through several years, without profit,
the expense of the business and the cost of production
are enhanced. ;;r tf Â»^
Those distant growers, subjected to these disadvan
tages, find another fact hard to believe, 1 - which is that a
peach tree, set in the orchard in January or our other
spring months, may be expected to bloom and bear fruit
the same season. This strange union of longevity and of
precocity in bearing is characteristic of all of our fruit
plants. The olive in the Mediterranean countries "does
not bear until it is seventeen years old. Here it bear3
at three years and is expected to throw a full crop at
seven. All of these facts, and numerous others which con
stitute the foundation and permanence of our fruit indus
try, it is our object to put before our readers regularly,
with the expectation that the story, validated by the sig-*
; natures of observers and experts, will, be used to spread
; abroad information that will enlighten the stranger as to
I the capacities of California.
The latest of these publications, from the pen of Gen
eral Chipman, president , of the State Board of Trade,
by official figures demonstrated the magnitude of the
fruit industry here as a leading interest of the State. In
the East, as all men know, orchard crops are a side issue.
In some States, special- attention is paid 'to some lines of
fruit production. Missouri has created* a special inter
est in*the apple. New York, on the hills of the Hudson
and at Hammondsport and around Keuka Lake, has de
veloped a great industry in grapes, producing principally
the Concord and other congeners of the wild fox grape.
The peach in some Eastern centers is made a staple or
chard crop. But outside of California there "is no State
that regards fruit production as one "of its leading inter
ests, because the climatcand soil, by natural selection and
adaptation, do not indicate, as here, a Special and friendly
fitness for that form of production. -
The pre-eminence of California in this" respect is tes
tified to throughout the East by certain commercial facts.
We speak of the odors of Araby when perfumes and
their origin occur; Golconda and Kimberley occur when
diamonds are thought of; Cashmere and the Gardens of
Gul are joined when we think of nature's floral gifts.
Now in exactly the same sense California has come to
be associated with fruits. Everywhere in the East, in any
considerable towns, one sees "California fruit" stores, and
from Duluth, "the zenith city of the unsalted seas," to
E^stport, Maine, everywhere our fruit is seen. It is
there while the snow lingers in the late spring, and when
it falls in early winter, and before either leaf or bloom is
on the Eastern tree, and long after both have fallen.
With these advantages, and progressive improvement
in packing and transportation, California fruit will hold
a lead in which it has already left the rest of the world
far behind. Nor is our field limited to the United States.
"Every season increases our fresh fruit shipment to Lon
don and widens its market in that metropolis. Our dried
fruits, including raisins and prunes, are rapidly reaching
for the control of the world's^ market in those products,
and will finally conquer and hold it. This. widespread
influence of our products is base^ on soil and climate,
longevity of trees and vines, and extraordinary produc
tion. As these elements inhere in natural arid unchange
able physical conditions, which, exist nowhere else as
they do here, it will be seen that we have a specialty
which none can take from us.
We are just upon the eve of expansion in the charac
ter and^falue of our orchard products. When the plans
of Mr. Swingle of the Agricultural Department are per
fected there is no reason to doubt that we will domesti
cate on the Colorado desert a date production that will
supply the world. There the deglet noor, the "date of
light," the finest grown, can reach unlimited .production
as soon as adequate irrigation is provided. Now it is
grown on oases in the Sahara, where it is laboriously
irrigated with water drawn in buckets from deep wells,
and is transported to railroads in Algeria on. the backs
of camels. He proposes also to introduce into Northern
California the large pistachio nut of Syria, a high-priced
article of commerce, which should flourish here like the
almond. Natural fitness will domesticate with us other
valuable exotic fruits to supplement our present standard
sorts. Â» Â¦Â¦Â¦

A tragic upsetting of the beautiful
tableau in the prelude to "Ben Hur"
at the Grand Opera-house a few
nights ago was only averted by the
strong poise and self-control of the
actors who impersonate the "three
wise men." In the setting for the
scene appear three camels. One of
these beasts of the desert is alive, the
two ; companions in the picture are
merely stuffed "property" affairs. It
is with the live camel that this tale
hath to do.
Shortly before the curtain was rung
up on the scene during the night in
point some heedless wit fed three
large and ' aromatic California
onions to the real camel. The
vegetables were gems as spec
imens .of odoriferous garden
truck. They were laden with the true
onion flavor. Our friend, the camel,
munched the fodder with evident de
light, for they were succulent mor
sels. Unfortunately the thoughtless
wight who was guilty failed to fol
low with the all essential sen-sen.
On the stage the onion burdened
camel was led. As the curtain part
ed on the scene the "wise men" got
a whiff of the exhalation of onions.
And they got it strong. The longer
they stood before the beast the strong
er became the offense. To move
would have ruined the scene. It was

art won. â¢ * f 'r'?'-~

From the bottom of my heart I feel
a deep pity for the average marrfed
woman. She earns her money as nobly
and as completely as does any day la
borer. She keeps a man's house, rears
his children, makes his life happy. And
for this she receives no pecuniary com
l>ensation beyond an inadequate
amount of money, too often ungra
ciously giv;n. Surely, a high price to
pay for the privilege of writing "Mrs."
before her name!
â¢An allowance â a liberal allowance â
ungrudgingly bestowedâ is the solution
to more domestic difficulties than this
world dreams of.
I once knew a man whose wife lived
on board-and-clothes wages. He was
suddenly called out of town and left
her $100 with which to manage the
house in his absence. In Joy at having
such an enormous sum to handle, she
rushed out and* spent 20 cents â yes,
twenty whole cents â on chocolates. The
husband returned unexpectedly the
same night and demanded the money
he had left with her. Shamefacedly
and trembling she handed him $99 80,
and faltered. out the teirible truth as to
the missingr 20 cents. v9>'
â¢\lust like a woman!" sneered her
lord and master. "The best of them
can't be trusted to handle cash."
When a man dies and leaves his for
tune to his wife, small wonder she so
often squanders it. Had she handled
it more freely in its collector's lifetime
she would dispense it more wisely after
his death. | '-'AfJx*
Many a man grumbles that his wife
has no idea of the value of money.
When I hear a man say that sort of
thing: I mentally explain his wife's ig
norance of money values on the ground
that she never has any money to exper
iment on.
Of course there are women whose one
joy in life is to spend their husbands'
money recklessly. There must be.

say so. But there are also men mean
enough to grudge daily bread to their
wives. Everyday observation tells us
that. So. the average is probably quite
as much to one sex as to the other.
Many a man who brands his wife as
extravagant would "fall dead" if she
spent as much on her own amusements
as he spends on his.
The 'murder of President McKinley followed close
upon those incendiary utterances, and since then we have
seen a great increase in the number of half-baked crea
tures, full of mock heroics, who look upon the President
as the actual source of want and oppression, whose death
will bring in Utopia. Under these circumstances the
whole country is interested in safety for the person of the
President and indorses the inquiry now in progress be
fore the Police Commission into the reason for permit
ting the crank to waylay him in church. It is a strange
revelation of- the perversity of the oblique mind that such
precautions are necessary, in a time of peace and general
prosperity, when the country .has less reason than ever
in its history to complain of economic or political con
ditions. But deplorable as it is, the fact exists, and goods
citizens can ohly^hope for such a moderation of personal
and political criticism as will gradually efface the incite-,
ment of the weak and criminal to murder.
United States has to be guarded against attack, and is not
free to go and come in safety, like any other citizen, sore
experience has proved that he is/no longer safe from
harm. President Roosevelt chafes under the restriction
of his liberty. He still leaves the White House on foot
for long and vigorous walks, â¢ or for horseback excur
sions, and when he is in the open, away from the crowd,
is amply capable of defending himself. But every citizen
feels that Presidents are in danger in crowds and must
be guarded.
Since Mr. William Randolph Hearst said in his news
papers in April, 1901: "If a man in search of big game
walked into a zoological garden it would be foolish of
him to spend his time trying to kill a mouse, with ele
phants, tigers and lions all around. It is equally foolish
to aim his blood and thunder at. the old-fashioned little
kings and emperors, when the really big men are so
plentiful and so near at home," and, describing the exe
cution of Louis XVI, said, "So when we hint that this
republic is in danger now, jusf remember what a short
time intervened between the King alive and drinking and
the King dead .and all the peasants eating," there has
been spread a feeling among assassins that the road to
national happiness and plenty lies in the assassination of
the President. â¢ '

Steamship Hyades Arrives in Port.
TACOMA, Dec. 2.â The steamship
Hyades arrived in port to-day from

FRESNO, Dec. 2. â The Farmers^
National Bank of this city began suit
to-day against the Union Trust Com
pany of San Francisco for $32,424 71.
The litigation grows out of the Por
ter Bros. Company failure. The plain
tiff alleges that the mon^y was paid
to the trust company by the receivers
of the Porter Bros. Company, to be
in- turn paid by it to the Farmers'
Bank ;, that demand had been -made
by the plaintiff bank -upon the trust
company for the" amount, but that it
had not yet been paid. The plaintiff
therefore asks for a judgment, but
without interest or costs. The suit is
a friendly one and is brought to pro
tect the trust company when it'pays.

FRESNO, Dec. 2. â A valuable au
tomobile owned by O. B. Olufs, a local
grain merchant, took fire to-day from
a defective sparker and was destroyed
in the middle of J street, near the
postoffice. When the blaze started
Olufs stopped the machine- and en
deavored to extinguish the flames, but
the lire had gained too much head
way. In a few seconds the woodwork
and upholstering were blazing fierce
ly and an alarm was turned in for
the fire department. . The firemen
misunderstood the direction given
them and went on* to another part of
town. A crowd of several hundred
people had gathered in the meantime
and watched the fire. Advice was
plentiful, but every one seemed to
fear an explosion of the gasoline and
stood on* at a distance. Finally one
of the chemical engines^ was secured
and a stream turned on that -quickly
subdued the flames, but not until the
automobile was a total wreck, nothing
being left by the Iron framework.

In connection with the present agi
tation in the 'umber trade over the im
pending fight between the Pacific Coast
Company and the schooner owners it
cii learned yesterday that Henry E. Â¦
Huntington.- vibe president of the
Southern Pacific Company, and A- 9.
Hammond. ' the lumber magnate of
Northern California, are soon to en
gage in the lumber business on a large
scale in Southern California. The two
millionaires have already had "several
conferences regarding the project,
which will be inaugurated by the open
ing of a big lumber yard at San Pedro,
to be controlled by a company which
is now beinff formed and in which
Huntington and Hammond will con
trol the bulk, of stpek.
While Hammora has been In the
north arranging for future deliveries
.nf lumber to the company in the south,
Huntington has been busy negotiating
with E. H. Harriman for the purchase
rf thirtv acres of land on San Pedro
Bay owned by the Southern Pacific
Company. Ttie land is part of Timms
Point, the greater portion of which was
filled in some months ago by the rail
road company Bnd is a commanding
Fite for lumber traffic in that It is ap
r>'rcÂ»achM by deep wuter and will af
ford fhÂ«* saf*? docking of lumber ves
pel*. It is the intention of the Hunt
inpton-Hammond syndicate to operate
inelr own vessels, as soon as they can
"The Pacific Coast Company will first
endeavor in every possible way to in
duce the lumber carrying schooners to
abandon their traffic in coastwise pas
sengers, and if. they refuse to do so
our company will immediately inaugu
rate a service of its own and with its
yards at different points along the coast
launch forth in the lumber trade."
The Pacific Coast Lumber Company
has been organized by the Pacific Coast
Company for the . purpose of carrying:
"n the fight, which it Is expected will
bÂ»! on by January 1, unless the schoon
er owners in the meantime agree to go
out of the passenger business.

In discussing the purposes of his
Â¦OSthera trip yesterday Bell stated that
he e xpected to remain here a week and
would then continue down the coast to
San Pedro. â¢ Before coming to San
Francisco he visited a large number of
the lumber mills In the State of Wash
ington, including those of the Weyer
hdeusers. who are. the largest holders
of- timber lands on the coast, and he
claims that, he received from a large
number of them assurance of a big
supply of lumber when it is needed for
the new yards* which the Pacific CoasJ.
Company purposes to open. Concern
ing the prospective fight. Bell said:
ARE READY â¢ FOB WAS.
Bell is regarded as one of the most
practical lumber men on the coast, and
for that reason he has been given
charge of what many look forward to
as ono of the bitterest fights that has
ever been waged -on the slope. Yester
day Bell spent a great deal of his time
amor? the representatives of the larger
lumber interests, especially those that
have cjrencies.in the southern part of
the State. One of the first moves to be
mad"e by Bell will be to establish a big
Jard at San Pedro. The Hoopers of
this city h^ve already been ordered to
vacate the property there that they
have long leased from the Pacific Coast
Â« 'ompany.' It is possible that the com
pany will also establish a yard in this
city.
James E. v Bell, former manager of
the Bell-Nelson Lumber Company of
Kverett, who has been engaged by the
Pacific Coast' Company to carry on its
fight agains.t the lumbermen of Cali
fornia, whose schooners have entered
into the passenger tram"? business,^ ar
rived yesterday from the north and is
registered at the Grand Hotel. Through
Hell the Pacific Coast Company has ar
ranged to establish lumber yards -at va
rious southern points, including San
Pedro. Kan Diego, Santa Barbara and
Los Angeles, with a view toward cut
ting the present rates on lumber and
forcing the \ mill concerns that have
i'een carrying passengers between the
coast ports on their schooners to aban
don this traffic.'
VICTORIA, B. C, Dec. 1â The steam
er Iro Maru, which arrived to-day from
the Orient, brought Captain and Mrs.

and off the Formosan coast.
Searching parties found two of the
men belonging to the mate's boat,

to carry wood. "and when found were
naked and their bodies were blistered
and_ sore. The clothing belonging to
the others and identified by Captain
Hoelstad was found in a savage vil
lage, where ell had been killed. What

can walk ten miles a day without be-
ing greatly fatigued. I have not taken
a drop of medicine since I began the
use of Grape-Nuts and people say I
look many years younger than I
really am.
"My poor old sick body has been
made over and I feel as though my
head has been too. Life Is worth liv-

many year* to come if I can keep away
from bad foods and have Grape-Nuts."

Judge James Cole of Kansas City
exploded a bombshell at the dog show
in Mechanics' Pavilion yesterday af
ternoon in the first class which came
onder his official notice.
St. Bernards headed the list and the
two old rivals,' Le King and Dewey,
the latter also being known as Lester
C, met in the judging ring. For three
yeans Dewey has swept every thing be
fore him, winning 'first and specials at
all the prominent shows under Judges
Mortimer and Roper. The big dogs
were paraded yesterday before Judge
Cole and that â¢ official Quickly took in
the strong and the weak points of the
old-time rivals. After deliberating for
a moment he awarded the blue rib
bon to Le King.
There was a round of applause for
the victor and then a buzz of con
versation as the fanciers discussed the
apparently unexpected award. It was
â¢ conceded by the authorities "that Le
King was a better headed dog than
Dewey and that this more than off
set his deficiency of body. Le King
was shown In better condition than
toeretof ore, which materially aided
him In defeating his rival, which has
three victories over him to his credit.
Le King beat Dewey at the. Tanforan
show when Harry .Lacy judged.
The dogs benched at the Pavilion
make a compact, interesting show. The
best known breeds are all represented,
and some splendid individuals are
benched. There are some rare^English
Betters, with a number of sporty., point
ers which show class in a marked 'de
gree. There are enough bulldogs,- with
their ' beautifully homely faces, to en-

This exhibition is expected to prove
one of the most Interesting ever held

AGREES TO PAY PORTION
OF RECEIPTS TO THE CITY
President Platt of Geary-Street Rail
way Company Slakes Promise
to Supervisors.
Horace G. Platt, president of the
Geary-street Railway Company, ap
peared before the Board of Supervisors
yesterday and agreed to pay to the city
6 per cent of the gross receipts of the
road pending the grant of a new fran
chise for the line.
In view of the fact that the City At
torney had ruled that the board had no
power to pass a resolution allowing the
road to operate without interference,
Platt was sent for and agreed, to the
ruling of the committee that his promise
to pay a percentage of the receipts,, as
the charter provides, gave no franchise
rights to the corporation. .
There were so many interesting things
in connection with the sport at Oakland
track yesterday that* it is difficult to
pick out any one feature that over
shadowed Â¦ the others. In defeating
Hagerdon and Sad Sam the Jennings
crack Shotgun stepped five furlongs in
59% seconds â within a quarter of a sec
ond of the track record. /
. Cascine kept behind him in the two
year-old scramble Otto Stifel, Don
Domo and . Bearcatcher, winning in a
gallop. The start was somewhat ragged
and the latter colt behaved so ungentle
manly that he was left.
The handicap, at 'a mile, was one of
the prettiest contests of the season, re
sulting in a victory for Fossil, due
greatly to the splendid riding of Ad
kins. v
In the concluding event the finish was
sensational, seven horses passing the
judges noses and heads apart. The de
cision went to* The Fretter, which low
ered the coast record for one mile and
three-sixteenths to 2:01^4, the old mark
being 2:02.
The weather was warm and balmy,
the track in excellent condition and the
attendance large. Favorites just -held
their own, splitting the card with long
er priced "horses.
TROUBLE AT THE POST.
Much disappointment was expressed
over the result of the two-year-old
scramble, at five and a half furlongs.
Not that Cascine was not entitled to all
the laurels won, but because of the un
toward circumstances which prevented
Don Domo and Bearcatcher from being
more prominent. Garnet Ferguson's big
brown colt did everything he should
not have done at the post, and was
finally left. Just as the barrier was re
leased Don Domo swerved to the in
side, losing several lengths and ruining
his prospects. Adkins then toyed along
with the favorite, Cascine, winning
about as he saw fit from Otto Stifel.
Don Domo was third.
When he met Shotgun in the five
furlong dash Sad Sam plainly showed
that he felt as uncertain of his social
position as a tramp would feel in being
introduced to the President at a White
House reception. Still the gentlemen
from the "bush" region's who use a cur
rycomb^ for a hair brush and flowing
whiskers for a white shirt decoy strung
theirs on Sad Sam. / This* enabled the
Easterners to get even money about
Shotgun. The favorite led from the
start,' first brushing off Sad Sam, and
then finishing out a cheerful winner
from the Hard ridden Hagerdon.
FOSSIL WELL HANDLED.
An evenly balanced- field of nine
started in the mile handicap. Bean
Ormonde opened favorite at 3, and
his price remained firm at that fig
ure. Claude was asked to carry 120
pounds and fell in for his share of
Bupport at 6 to 1. Divina looked nice
ly in with 108, and closed second
choice. Contrary to custom, the top
weights, Claude, Albula and the fa
vorite, cut out the early running, the
first named lasting longest at the
game. Adkins waited with Fossil un
til thei stretch was reached, when he
skimmed through on # the rail and at
the wire beat Divina with apparent
ease in 1:40%. The latter mare had
a. most uneven voyage, for she came
with a late rush, just nosing- out
Claude for place honors. \ Eonic never
looked dangerous.
, Two or three members of the tfh.m
boo brigade had Laureatea for a good
thing in the first number. At 7 to 1
the mare suddenly blossomed as a
front runner, getting home a handy
winner over Alice Carey, the favorite.
Bee Rosewater ran third.
D. Hall rode a determined sort of
race on Rollick, favorite for the six
furlong selling affair, and in a drive
downed Quiet a head. The Don re
ceived stanch support and with more
racing' luck might have won.
Not in many moons has such a fin
ish been witnessed as the closing mile
and three-sixteenths race furnished. In
the run to the wire the pacemakers,
The Fretter, Illowaho and Grail, were
closed in on, and strung across the
track seven horses crossed the â¢ wire
with only noses and heads separating
them. The Fretter, ridden by Kunz,
carried the verdict, with Dodie S sec
ond and Grail third.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Jockey Adams is here with a super
fluous supply of junk and a good rec
ord-in the saddle, made on the East
ern tracks. Adams was in the em
ploy of Harry Stover last winter.
Ed Jasper, racing secretary of
Worth track, and who will act In a
like . capacity at Ascot Park, Los An
geles, is busy at the track every day,
hustling up stake entries for the
southern' meeting.
Jockey "Mack" Coburn will arrive
here from New York within a few
days. Under the terms of .his rein
statement a year ago he will not be
permitted to ' accept any mounts on
the California Jockey Club tracks.
R. King, who rode Quiet, -'was giv
en the balance of the week on the
ground for rough riding.
i .Adklns rode in far better form yes
terday, piloting three winners. He
should cut : out such tactics, though^
ashe<used when riding Cascine.
Rollick,, winner" of the third race,
was bid up from $400 to $1000 by Dr.
Rowell, owner of Quiet. Later the
doctor claimed The Don for '$725.
..Another starter in' the third event,
Albemarle,' was- claimed for '$725 by
E. Tierhey, owner.'of Quatre. , .
The - yearlings from Antrim stock
farm will be sold next Monday, even
ing at the Occidental j Horse; Exchange.

track record of 59 % seconds for five

Dick Dwyer sent the field away In

on his hands.

Colored Soldier's Court-Martlal.
Private Clark Magee, the colored
soldier, who assaulted Lieutenant Ed
ger at the general hospital of the Pre
sidio, will be tried by a general 'court^
martial at the post to-dayl Magee
has â¢ made a full confession of his | in
.tent to kill the officer and shortly after
the attack he expressed his disappoint
ment at not having succeeded. Magee
has secured the services of Attorney
Walter , Gallagher, who will defend
him. There seems to be but one.loop
hole through which the soldier ; can
escape" and that is a plea of Insanity.
Should the man fail to prove that he
was insane at the "* time ', of the assault
it will go hard with him, as the crime
with .which he Is charged is one'of the
most' serious^ in the penal calendar 1 of

*^*r-* Is Not a Skin Disease*
Most people hare mn idea that rheumatism is contracted liko a cold, that the
damp, chilly air penetrates the muscles and joints and causes the terrible aches
and pains, or that it is something like a skin disease to be rubbed away with lini-
ment or drawn out with plasters; but Rhuematism originates in the blood and is
caused bj Urea, or Uric Acid, an irritating, corroding poison' that settles in mus-
cles, joints and neryes, producing inflammation and soreness and the sharp, cutting
pains peculiar to this distressing disease.

Charles O'Brien, who picks other peo

is out of jail, was held to the Superior
Court with ball fixed at $1000 by Judge
Mogan.
O'Brien's method of "dipping," as ex
plained to the court, was time-honored
and usually effective. With a couple of
confederates he would board a crowded
Btreet car and snatch a purse and make
good his escape while his pals obstruct
ed pursuit. He tried the, trick once too
often, however, on November 25, when
he slipped his hand into the pocket of
Nash B. Agiiayo on a . Kearny-street
car and was caught arid held by his In
tended victim before his accomplices
could Interfere. The outcry raised by
Agiiayo was so fierce that they were
lucky to escape arrest.

"What on earth has broken loose
among the Mission boarders?" in
quired the court,
There was no reply, but the evi
dence in the case clearly < showed
what had broken loose in that Swiss
hotel. The inmates of the hostelry,
it appeared, were participating in a
birthday party and to inject some nov
elty into the entertainment Mr. Inder
bitzen offered to wrestle any man In
the house for drinks for the assem
blage. As the challenger was noted
for athletic prowess his invitation was
not accepted with any promptitude,
and then, to prove his superiority in
the art of catch-as-catch-can Mr. In
derbitzen grabbed an inoffensive mer
rymaker, nimbly tripped him up, vio
lently cast him down and then pro
ceeded to demonstrate the utility of a
half-Nelson lock. At this Juncture
Mr. Guertr interfered and Mr. Inder
bitzen . resented the intrusion by
springing to his feet, drawing a knife
and smiting Mr. Guertr's nose, break
ing a small bone of that organ.
. Mr. Guertr ha/1 his nose in court
with him and evidently carried the
sympathy of a large majority of the
witnesses, for most of them testified
In his behalf and solemnly declared
that the nose-breaking ended the fra
cas â that nobody attempted to mo
lest the assailant. As this preponder
ance of testimony failed to explain
how Mr. Inderbitzen received a badly
bruised eye and a deep' cut In . his
head, the case was taken under ad
visement until December E.
â¢"Where?" sharply inquired the
court, when his clerk read off the lo
cation of the scene of strife.
. "At 4322 Mission street," was re
peated.
Then came another apartment
house imbroglio to tax the patience
and gray matter of his Honor Mogan.
Joseph Inderbitzen was accused of
violently assaulting George Guertr In

Chinese blackmail methods were ex
posed yesterday in United States Court
Commissioner Heacock's court by Da
vid D. Jones, official interpreter of Chi
nese for. the District Attorney's office.
The case was that of Chin Mee Took, a
laborer, returning from China and
claiming to be a native born American
citizen. Chin produced a record of the
United States District Court certifying
to his admission to this country on a
former occasion as a native born Amer
ican, but. the Chinese Bureau was not
convinced that he was the person men
tioned in the record.
Chin was balled out by A security
company, a Chinese firm furnishing the
cash. Yesterday Fong Ping, a Chi
nese interpreter, approached Mr. Jones
and informed him that Chin's bonds
men had determined to surrender him
Into custody because they had learned
that that was nut his name and that
the court record "was riot his. '
| Mr. Jones' suspicions were aroused
by the eagerness of the Chinese to al
low Chin to be deported to China,, and
he had an ; interview with the defend
ant. Chin said that he had paid Fong
Ping's people $5 for costs and a certain
sum for the bail bond, and that he had
promisedito pay $25 morefdr an attor
ney's fee,' but, that Fong Ping had de
manded $60 additional, threatening, at
the same time, that If.lt were not paid
his bondsmen would surrender him into
custody and he would be deported.
Chin introduced witnesses before
Commissioner Heacock, and they
proved that Chin was not an impostor,
but the person he had represented him
self to be. The court discharged him
from custody ; and "remarked that it
was a clear case of an attempt to rail
road a man to China because he would
not submit to be blackmailed.
O. P. Stidger, who acted as attorney
for Chin, stated that he would waive
his fee of $25. '.
the' Hall of Justice the policeman con
siderately escorted him to ' the City
Hospital and had his battered head
dressed and bandaged. .
The case went over, until Friday.

pany; angered'Manager'.Schwerin' and

line In San Francisco by cutting rates
. to $1 per ton. ~ \ â¢ .
No serious damage would have re
sulted from this cut. had the Pacific
Mal\ been able to keep the fight inits
own field/Unfortunately, however, for
the other Coast lines operating
to the . Orient; a 11 rate out of San
Francisco did not harmonize with a $5
rate out of 'Portland and Puget Sound
ports, and to keep everything from.go
| Ing coastwise to S"an Francisco and
thence to the Orient, the Northern. lines
were forced to cut the rate to $3, a fig
ure low enough to prevent coastwise
shipments. This $2 cut has cost the five
regular lines operating" out of San
Francisco, Portland,' Puget Sound and
; Vancouver,. $25^,000 up :to October last;
arid there had been no gain whatever
at the expense of the newcomer. In the
field. This loss of : $254,000 was, in
creased In November by the loss of 51,

coast ports. The engagements for De
cember loading from Portland and'Pu
get Sound alone are 48,000 tons, with at
; least 10,000 tons to go but of San Fran

end not yet in sight: . , . ; .
The action of the China Commercial
Steamship Company Mn sending, the
steamship Lothian to Portland is re
garded as a master stroke. The Lothian
was sent here because the Pacific Mail
corraled all of the freight out of San
Francisco at $1 per ton. At Portland
the steamer will take a full cargo of
7000 tons at $3 per ton. This will make
her cargo net the owners $14,000 more
than they could have secured had
Schwerin given them a chance at a
San Francisco cargo.
This transaction of the Lothian 1b
only 'a forerunner of the demoralization
which Is to follow; unless Harriman
curbs his steamship manager and ex
tends the olive branch. The Canton
people will riot only send the Steamship
Lothian to Portland, which is in Har

The China Commercial rate was. $15,
which is itself something fairly tempt

: With the departure of the Lothian
the old rates will go into effect on Pa
cific Mall liners and will be maintained
until the next China Commercial steam
ship is ready to receive passengers. A
few took advantage of the lower rate,
however, and several of the Chinese'
passengers who will leave to-day on the
Hongkong Maru will cross the Pacific
at a cost to each of them of $2.
The Chinese'- who sailed on the Lo
thian were nearly all old men. who are
going back to China to die.- Under or
dinary circumstances many of them
would have availed themselves of the
various Oriental schemes for. making
Unele Sam ser.d them home. Before
deportation, however, there Is a period
of detention in jail, and, Â» although the
scheme is costless, it is more annoying
than the soending of 515 with an im
mediate departure. This rate *war is'
pleasing to the officials of the Chinese
Bureau,' much of whose time is taken
up with these o'.d men, who, for the
sake of a free ride home, acknowledge
themselves illegally in the land of the
free. The prosecution of these cases Is
expensive, so that, although rates to
China ranging from $2 to $15 may be
ruinous for transportation companies,
they mean many dollars saved fÂ«r

Three young matrons strenuously de
fending their respective spouses made
a refreshing feature of Police Judge Mo
gah's matutinal soiree yesterday. The
parties all dwell in ; an a'partment
house at 2006A Howard street, and last
Sunday afternoon the domicile was the
scene of a fracas, in which unsavory
language was freely interspersed with
fistic prowess. As an outcome of the
! shindy George Green, John Green and
John T, Hooper were charged by Louis
T. "Williams with having, collectively
and individually; assaulted and bat
tered, him. -
In support of his accusation Williams
carried fnto court an eye much swollen
and heavily fringed with mourning.
Â¦Endeavor to ascertain who inflicted the
injury and the provocation that led to
j the assault was the bewildering task
! cut out for the court, and after tack
ling, it for about two hours the Judgej
was compelled to continue the case till
j Saturday, by which time he hopes to
I have disentangled and straighte* 3d out
; the conflicting mass of testimony ad
j iiuced and sworn to by three husbands,
! as many loyal wives and a young man
i'with no matrimonial tie.
From what the court has already
; learned it is inclined to suspect that
j on last Sunday Mrs. George Green and
j Mrs. John T. Hooper went to the cor
| Her grocery to purchase Saratoga chips,
'' and . that while they were returning
through the hallway of their common
residence. Louis T. Williams poked his
| head out of the door of the room which
f he occupies with his wife and sneering
l ly said to the ladies, "Ha, ha; you've
â¢ been after beer again." Then Mr. Green
I asked Mr. Williams if he had addressed
! Mrs. Green in insulting tone, and Mr.
! Williams replied in the affirmative, and
1 accentuated his confession by striking
I Mr. Green on the jaw. At this point of
the narrative coherence becomes cloud
! ed, but all the witnesses agreed that
i there was a mix-up, in which a razor
figured, and that blows were freely in
| terchanged between Mr. Williams on
| one side and George Greeni his brother
I John and John T. Hooper on the other.
Mrs. Green and Mrs. Hooper swore
â¢that Mr. Williams was the aggressor
i. throughout, and that Mr. Hooper, Mr.
i Green and brother John were compeJled
I in self-defense to raise their hands and
â¢ smite. Mrs; Williams, however, assev
j erated that her husband had been
I' "picked on" by the three defendants
i and the other two wives, and that on
I one occasion as she was passing along
i the hallway John T. Hoopef.met her
! and in an insulting way dug his right
elbow into her left ribs; also, that in
the Sunday melee Mrs. Hooper rolled
up her sleeves and struck the witness
;a straight punch upon the chest. .
While the exhibition of conjugal fe
licity was general, Mrs. John Green was
the most spectacular in display of wife
ly devotion. When asked .if she was
sure she saw Mr. Williams strike her
husband she enthusiastically answered:
"Sure of It? Well, I should say so.
Wasn't I there â a Johnnie on the
spot?"
Again, when the Assistant District
Attorney courteously asked Mrs. Green
If her husband had not struck Mr. Wil
liams while the latter gentleman was
prostrate, the lady eyed him withering
ly and popped the counter-query:
Â¦ "Do you think my husband is a cow
ard like that thing there?" pointing to
where Mr. Williams sat nursing his
bruised optic.
"This is a case," opined Judge Mo
gan, "that requires time to be slept
over, reviewed dispassionately and de
cided intelligently. While the testimony
.stands at the ratio of six to two In
favor of the defendants, I will reserve
my Judgment till next Saturday."
And the trio of wedded couples went
away arm-in-arm, while John Green
looked comparatively unprotected as he
sallied forth alone.
After wearily listening to a repeti
tion of the arguments'the Judge sent
the defendants to the Superior, Court,
with the bail of each fixed at $1000.
Sam L>unt and A. F. Francis, dealers
in the lacteal fluid, had stolen from
the Standard Milk Company eleven
cans and twenty-one bottles, and John
Cox was accused by the same com
plainant of having pilfered from the
same corporation one bottle box and
three tanks, of the total value of J15.
The case had been dragging through
the court several weeks, but the ver
bal contention was waged as fiercely
yesterday morning as if the cause
were fresh and the parties inspired by
new-born passion.

E" SEDORAH"
"Sedorah" is the title of our next offering. That
mow it will please goes without saying. Having,
ed the approval of the most critical judges, it
lot fail to be highly regarded and preserved by
patrons of The Sunday Call.
"Sedorah" represents a rare type of beauty, in
that a peculiar piquancy is given to the expression
of the face of the young girl by the wealth'of gold-
en hair and hÂ«r. dark eyes. The richness of her
blond tresses is heightened by the pearls and roses,
carelessly arranged in her coiffure, and the contrast-
ing background and the diaphanous drapery give
warmth and brilliancy to the flesh tones.
. . In treatment, this picture approaches sketchi-
ness, and this quality may account to some extent
for its brilliancy and effectiveness. It seems to.
have been conceived and executed with a single im-
pulse, with none of the changing and retouching that
are responsible for the labored and ofttimes unskill-
ful aspect of the work of some artists.
Printed on heavy paper and surrounded by a
rich gold border, it is the most decorative and at-
tractive art picture that has been produced in Ameri-
ca, let alone given away. >: v
If you overlooked getting the first of the Series
In Gold, you surely cannot afford. to miss this.

The Pacific Mail Company's steam
ship China, Captain Friele, put in an
unexpected appearance yesterday after/
noon, having made the run from Hono
lulu .in five days ami fourteen hours.
Quarantine inspection, in spite of the
fact that the liner had on board more
than 400 passengers, detained her only
about thirty-five minutes, and she was
alongside her berth at the Pacific Mail
dock by 5 o'clock.
The .China brought a email cargo,
only^ l'SOtbns. and stood higher out *>t
the water than she usually appears
coming into port. Of passengers she
brought 417, divided as follows: Xinety
eight in the cabin, 37 steerage, 122 Japa
nese and 160 Chinese. She brought lit
tle silk and ho opium, but in her strong
room carried treasure valued at $350,000.
Lieutenant F. L. Sandoz of the navy,
who with his wife was a passenger
on the liner, came from the Asiatic sta
tion in charge of a number of sick jack
les. . Lieutenant Sandoz was attached
to the Kentucky, and when he boarded
the China at Kobe was accompanied by
as many of the flagship's . officers as
could get away. Ab the China passed
the Kentucky the. crew, lined the rails
and in ringing cheers gave proof of the
lieutenant's popularity, while the flag
ship's band contributed "Home, Sweet
Home" to as .fine a send-off as was ever
tendered to a young officer by his ship
mates. Sandoz is said to have been
one of the best liked on the
Asiatic station, and on board the China
every passenger was his friend. He
speaks with glowing pride of Admiral
Evans aVd the discipline on the Asiatic
station generally, and on the Kentucky
in particular. On the' Kentucky, he
said, Fighting Bob's enthusiasm had so
leavened the ship's personnel that fric
tion had been eliminated and the ship's
affairs, almost fan themselves. After
leaving the men In his care at Mare
Island the lieutenant will proceed to
his home in Louisiana, :
i Colonel A; Mackenzie, ; Major H. B.
Moon and Captain G. W. ;Read, who
were on the board of army officers sent
to Honolulu to select a site for a per
manent, army post, returned " on the
China. ' > . 0 Â¦ " ' : - \
Another passenger was jj. T. - Golds
borough, chief engineer "of the i coast
survey steamship Pathfinder. He Is on
his way East to join another ship, but
which one he does not know. The Path
finder is surveying, the waters of '.the
Philippines, and - Goldsborough . says
that there would be* fifty years'. .work
before her if she, remained in, that part
of the world until the surveying in con?
templation r has been completed.- .â¢ ;

Big. Freighter Coming Here.
The British steamship Oanfa left Yokohama
for this port November 2S, and. it- is asserted,
is coming here under charter to the Occidental
and Oriental Steamship Company. The Oanfa
is an SWXMon freighter, with a cargo. carrying
capacity of more than 12,000 tons. She be
longs to Holt's "blue funnel" line...- >
Advices from Dodwel! & Co., Pacific Coast
agents, of the Alfred Holt' fleet, - with head
quarters at Tacoma, of which' the steamship
Oanfa is on*, say that she has not been char
tered by any company.- They state the Oanfa
1s regularly employed In the Liverpool -Tacoma
line.. She has space for 6000 tons Â¦ unoccupied
which the Occidental line wanted and terms
were made for her to carry this cargo to San
Francisco, alter which she will come to Ta
coma as usual. ' Â¦
Fifteen passengers who started from
Seattle on November 21, 1903. for San
Francisco on the steamship .Centennial
filed a* libel yesterday in' the United
States District' Court against the ves
sel.and. the Charles Nelson Company,
claiming $7620 damages.
The complaint tells a strange Jtory
of bad treatment on the part of the
second cabin stewards. All the pas
sengers tell practically the same story
under oath to the effect that they had
paid IS each for second cabin, pas
sage from Seattle to San' Francisco,
srood beds and meals being promised
in the advertisement. Daniel Good's
complaint is a fair sample of the rest.
It is as follows:.
"VThat during said voyage this libelant. Daniel
Good, was refused any bedding, blankets and
covfrlnsr to be used during the "nights ''and
was furnished no pillows, but was offered In
the D!ace and stead thereof. a lite preserver
for a pillow, and on Wednesday, the 115th of
November, the last day of the voyage, libelant
was unable to obtain any drinking water or
water- for washing his face and hands, and
that throughout the voyage the stench In the
mejs hair was' so unbearable as to ccuse libel
ant to become sick and unable to eat. and
during the whole voyage the food was of the
worst quality and not decently prepared and
was wholly unfit for use or consumption. And
the sleeping quarters were erected fpm up
rights of wood with strips of canvas hung
horizontally thereon, and the sleeper's quarters
were erected so near the toilet as to causa
disagreeable and unhealthy odors to permeate
the' whole premises. That notwithstanding at
this time there were plenty of unoccupied
berths In the second cabin and plenty of
blankets and covertne that might have been
utilized, that when . the steward ., was ap
proached by libelant touching afato -concerning
the furnishing of blankets and nifc?Ji8V ) libelant
wag informed that he coul<l hÂ£^ur tne same
by payinc $3 therefor. That mo*j. than . one
hundred passengers were crowded 3^; the one
room; â¢ Â¦ â¢ * .'
That durln* the whole voyage HbUant was
Ill-treated and subjected ta numerdfcs, Indig
nities and four dogs were placed In/hs same
apartments as libelant. % ' :
>/A. G. Micheels complains that he had
a narrow shelf to sleet^ on. with
a life preserver for a- pillow; that he
was obliged to pay the steward $1 for
a berth, and that a soiled, patched and
ill-smelling piece of bed ticking was
furnished as a table cloth. '*{
Harry Thompson, another libelant,
deposes that when he accused the stew
ard of "grafting" that official replied.
"Yes, that's my business. What do you
suppose I'm here for?" j-
Joseph Liflyn complains that on the
fourth day of the voyage there was no
drinking water to be had.
E. Gilbert, David F. Ruff and other
passengers ' depose that . they were
obliged to pay 25 cents additional for
each meal furnished them by the wait
er in the captain's cabin, the second
cabin food being unfit to eat. â¢

has been rather interesting- of late, for there

Ing up In many sections. -There If no question
now but that some districts Â¦* hare been over

stocked, but all other: cities around .the bay
ara now coming Into* the. market and the In
quiry along the. coast seems more active. From
all Indications our market. cannot long be sup

in. No; great effort has been made to market
much by water,"' but the railroad company is

The local demand for fresh fruits stood about
the same as on the previous ' day and Apples
continued the leading feature. Prices of fancy
Apples were steady under a good demand and
there was a better inquiry for low grade offer-
Ings. The second car of fancy stock from
Honey. Lake," Lassen County, was at hand. The
car consisted cljlefly of Spltzertbergs, which
met with a brisk demand at the top quotation.
There was a fair inquiry for chotce Grapes In
crates for shipment on the Puget Sound,
steamer, ar>d good dry stock readily -commanded
the top quotation. Off stock was rather dull at
unsteady â¢ prices. Winter Nellis Â¦ Pears were
withdrawn in small quantities from cold Â«tor
age. and offerings were Just about sufficient to
satisfy the demand, which was not very brisk.
Stocks in-storage are large, but they are being
held for the holiday trade. Receipts of Rasp
berries and Strawberries were light and prices
stood about tbe same as previously quoted.
Stocks of Coos Bay Cranberries' are cleaned up
and the quotations are withdrawn.
The Orange market is weak and prices are
lower. The demand locally is light, as the
stock lacks color . and sweetness and there is
nothing doing In the. shipping line,, as. outside
markets are being supplied . direct from the
growing districts. Mexican Limes are easy,
but unchanged. The Panama steamer brought
up 315 cases Limes and 43 <;rates Pineapples.

1 downward, wiping out part "of the early gain.
An upward spurt In two or three of the in
dustrial Fpeclaltiee partly rallied the market,
but realizing again met the advance and the
closlnr was active and irregular. ..
The cocsplfuous movements at the last were
a Jump of* 4\4 in Colorado Fuel. 7Â»i in the
Colorado Fuel convertible bonds, 3*, in Sugar
ar.d l T t in Â¦ Amalgamated Copper. The fact'
that there was no news to account for these
suQden Jumps aggravated the distrust with
which they were regarded by traders who were
trying to s-11 at other points In the market.
The persistent pressure upon Pennsylvania was
a drag upon the market from the outset, but
. it was overcome by a succession of buying
movements at other points' which gradually
dissipated 'the uneasiness. Buying for London
account was a factor In the advance. The
turn of the month released money to that
'n-.arkft and there was a more cheerful feeling
In- foreign markets over the prospect of peace
In the Far East.
Trade reports of the coal industry were en
rouraglng. Lehlgh Valley and Norfolk and
Western earnings for October showed good In
crease. Pennsylvania's Â«tatement for October
Ehoxved decreases of net for the lines both
east and west of Pittsburg and Erie owing to
the growth In operating expenses. A disposi
tion to realize in LouiEvllle and Nashville was
Ir.creafeed by the decline in net earnings for
October shown by Nashville. Chattanooga and
St. Louis.
Union Pacific October statement showed an
increase In net earnings of more than $400.
000. thus saving more than half the growth In
gross earnings, but this etock also showed the
effect of realizing, as did Its subsidiary com
pany. Southern Pacific. The lnuustrials as a
claw were higher and It was suspected that
closing uo of short accounts had much to do
â¢with" this. Â«-*r>ecially in United- States BUel
preferred. There is tome growth of a senti
ment that the Drices of stocks in this class
have discounted about the worst that â¢ could
happen la the industrial future, leaving room
for torn* natural rebound from excessh'e de
pression.
Money vent to 74 per cent again to-day
and- tl-e banks transferred $450,000 of their
r*sÂ»rvÂ« to New Orleans without any compen
sating advantage in foreirn gold engagement.
The or!nlon is gaining force that the tight
ness of Â¦ foreign money markets will probably
keep up the money ratÂ» here over the year.
The movement In bond prices continued
rather Irregular, realizing In speculative issues
being in evldtnr* in that market as 'well as
ftocks. Total sales of bonds, par value, .were
$3,154,000. Unit'd States bonds were' un

as there -; was no outlet . for shipping-, Â¦Â¦ stocks
were steadily- accumulating but holders were
'firm'? in . their,; views and were not â¢ inclined to
Â¦ force'- sales. The- market wav firm ' for. good
quality offerings of Sweet Potatoes .and two
cars of fresh stock that were marketed cleaned
up quickly at an advance. Onions ruled weak
and the-top quotation was obtained ' only r for
small lots of the Australian Brown' variety.

Secretary White of the Society for
Prevention of Cruelty to Children, is
seeking a' home for Axlna Kruger, a
seven-year-old Indian girl from Bris
tol Bay, Alaska, who Is at present an
inmate of the San Francisco Nursery
for Homeless Children, Twelfth and
Mission streets. The life story of the
child reads like a romance and . her
trials and adventures form a pathetic
story of human interest. ;
When Axlna was but a baby one of
her brothers murdered her father and
mother. She was taken in, charge by
a Mrs. Fred Kruger, a squaw and wife
of a German trader. Two years and
a half ago Mrs. Kruger died and Kru
ger came to this city' with little Ax
ina and his own son. The' children
were put in charge of Mrs. Samuel
Black of Sausalito and a short time
ago Kruger became involved in trou
ble with a woman and fled to Ger
many.
Mrs. Black found that she could not
take care of both children, so she sent
little Axina to the nursery, where she
has remained ever since. Secretary
White has been asked to find a' home
f or . her. She is a very . bright child,'
with a gentle disposition, and her, su
periors say she has always been obedi
ent and an apt scholar.

PERSONAL MENTION.
utors responsible for the non-payment
of taxes on property in Santa Clara
County, belonging to the estate. By
failure to pay^ the taxes the estate was
charged the sum of S77 13 above the
charged to the executors for their neg
amount of taxes and this sum is
ftgence. Â¦ ,
"I find," â¢ continues the court, "that
the item $4215 84, by commissions of C.
M. Gerrish, C. S. Tilton and Frank
Garcia, executors of said estate, must
be withdrawn from this account and
left until the settlement of the final
account. But as all these commissions
â$3300â have been drawn out by the
executors, without any order of the
court, and this withdrawal of the com
missions at the time was Improper,
the executors must be charged with
7 per cent interest upon the amounts
taken by each of them from the day
of the withdrawal to the time of the
payment of said money back Into the
estate, or until the same is deposited
in the Donohoe-Kelly Banking Com
pany's bank to the credit of the execu
tors of said estate." I
EXECUTORS RESPONSIBLE.
The court also holds the executors re
sponsible for paying $230 to R. H. Mc-
Gowan for bookkeeping services, on the
ground that they had no right to do so.
"The number of gallons of redwood
cooperage sold and accounted for in
this account is 235,043 gallons." con
tinues Judge Coffey in his "findings of
fact." "The redwood cooperage was
appraised in v the inventory filed by the
executors on the 9th day of May, 1900.
at a half cent per gallon. The execu
tors sold the greater part of said coop
erage at a half cent-per gallon, selling
some in excess of that amount and
some at seven-eighths of a cent per gal
lon in various lots from time t(j time,
without having obtained any order of
the court for that purpose, and said
sales were 3" made at private sales
without any notice of sale being given,
and no return of -sales of redwood
cooperage has ever been made to this
court and no order has heretofore been
made confirming said sales. The value
of such cooperate at the time of sales
being seven-eighths of a cent per gal
lon, the executors are to be charged
Â¦with this cooperage at that price and
credited with the total amount of the
sales accounted for in this account.
ACCOUNTS WERE WRONG.
"The executors are therefore to be
charged with 52056 62 less 51219 75.
â¢which la the amount of. said cooperage
accounted for as soW^ leaving a bal
ance of $836 88 with which the execu
tors should be charged.
"I further find that as to the items
found In said three accounts on account
of miscellaneous expenses and dis
bursements of- the said executors,
amounting to the sum of $282 20: that
items amounting to the sum of $176 05.

sums of money claimed r to have been

nor the testimony, specify in sufficient
detail when, where, for what and to
whom said expenses were incurred, are

surcharged with that amount. *1<6 0o.

The untimely blowing of a '- police
whistle prevented the capture of. two
burglars ih the butcher shop of Thom
as E. Millar at Union and Mason streets
Monday night. The crooks were at
work in the shop and a police officer
was within half a block of the scene,
when the shrill blast of a patrolling ser
geant's whistle alarmed the burglars
and they made their escape. The offi
cer who blew the whistle was not aware
of the crime and was calling for his
men, according to regulations, at the
time.
It was soon after midnight when Po
liceman John Evatt received informa
tion that burglars were at work in the
butcher shop. He was about two blocks
from thÂ«kj)lace, but started toward Ma
son and Union streets with, every pros
pect* of a good capture. He was within
half a block of the corner,. when Ser
geant Phil Frayer, unconscious I of
what was happening, sounded his whis
tle on Mason street, near Filbert, and
awakened the crooks to a sense of dan
ger. :it-':.'x^:'.:
One of the burglars, who was acting
as a lookout, shouted to his companion
inside that the" police were near and
the latter quickly darted out of the
door and the pair ran away. Evatt
gave chase, but was unable to make a
capture. With the sergeant he returned
to the butcher shop and an investiga
tion was made. It~was found that the
burglars had used a jimmy to open
the front door and that they had ap
plied the same implement to the cash
register and -telephone box. Their loot
was not extensive and did not amount
to more than $7.
The matter was immediately reported
to the Central police station, where in
structions were given to all the night
watches doing duty in the section to
keep a sharp lookout for the men, who
are said to have been responsible for
several other, crimes of a similar char
acter that have occurred on North
Beabh within the last week.
Jean Lapique was a pathetic figure as
he stood at the bar in Judge Cook's
court yesterday, with a bundle of pa
pers on the table in front of him, plead
ing for more time before going 'to 'trial
for the second time on a charge of for
gery. He refused the .court's offer to
appoint an attorney to defend him, say
ing he preferred .to defend himself. The
case was set for triai yesterday, and
when it was called Lapique made a mo
tion that new defendants be added in
the case, which the Judge denied, and
Lapique took an exception. The Judge
asked if, he was ready for trial, and he
renewed his motion. The Judge cut him
short by telling him to be prepared to
go to trial on December 9, to which he
took an exception.
Lapique has spent the , last eight
years in the County Jail, where he N is
known as the lawyer prisoner. He was
well known in* the French colony and
made , money .by buying and selling
lodging-houses. He was arrested in 1895
en a charge of felony embezzlement.
The complaining witness, was an old
Frenchman, who accused Lapique of
embezzling $1400. He was held to an-,
swer on September 6, 1895,'and the case
came to trial in Department 2 of the
Superior Court the following December,
the' jury disagreeing. At his seoonTl
trial, on April 8, 1896, he was convicted,
and on April 18 he was sentenced to
serve eight years in Folsom peniten
tiary. An appeal was taken to the Su
preme Court and he was granted a new
trial, but r on March 12, 1898, the case
was dismissed owing to the insuffi
ciency^ of evidence, the old man having
died meantime. .
: Lapique was at liberty till the follow
ing November, when he was arrested
on a emerge of forgery. He was ac
cused of forging the name of Louise
Lagarde as an indorsement on the back
of a promissory note for $800 drawn by
Philippe Maysounave in her favor. The
case dragged along in the Police Court
till October 2, 1899, when Lapique was
held to answer. On March 7, 1900, he
was convicted by a jury in Judge
Dunne's court, and on October 20 was
sentenced to serve nine years in Fol
som. Since then he-has been granted a
new trial . and the case transferred- to
Judge Cook's court. On the forgery
charge he has persistently refused to
have an attorney and has conducted
his own case.
"I find," said Judge Coffey, "that
the items on the credit side of the^sec-'
ond annual account, amounting to
$1686 13, including $1560 drawn from the
bank to pay the expenses of defending
the will upon the contest for its admis
sion to probate, are an improper credit
and ought not' to be allowed, excepting
the item of June 15, 1S99, by publication
notice of time and place for proving of
the willâ $4 50. which is allowed. Total
amount disallowed on this item,
$1681 63. '
"And as the executors did on June
11, ' 1901, without any order of court,
draw from the funds of the estate de
posited in the Donohoe-Kelly Banking
Company's bank the sum of $1560.
which sum was used by said executors*
in part payment of the above disal
lowed item of costs, the sai* executors
must be charged with interest on said
sum of $1560 at the rate of 7 per cent
per annum from June 11, 1901, to the
time of the payment of said money
back into the estate, or until the same
is deposited in' the . Donohoe-Kelly
Banking Company's bank to the credit
of the executors of the estate."
Judge Coffey -further finds the exec-
Probably the most sensational part of
the entire proceedings is the order of
Judge Coffey that A. E. Bolton of the
flrm of Galpin & Bolton. pay $1000 tc
John B. Gartland, attorney for Charles
S. Tilton, one of the executors. It ap
pears'from the records that Judge Cof
fey made an order allowing $5000 coun
sel fees to the attorneys of the execu
tors. Galpin & Bolton secured $4750 of
this amount and paid "over to Attorney
Gartland the sum of $250. The latter
; rotested and Judge Coffey saw the
Justice of his complaint. In his "find
ings of fact" the. court ordered that
Bolton pay' $1000 to Gartland out of the
sv.rn he allowed for counsel fees.
COURT'S FINDINGS.
Judge . Coffey intimates, in a docu
ment filed with the County Clerk, that
the executors of the estate of Amelia
R. Scott have grossly mismanaged the
estate. In settling the accounts of C.
M. Gerrish, Charles S. Tilton and
Frank Garcia, the court finds that they
exceeded their authority in using mon
eys of the estate and Rives them until
the 25th of this/month to pay- back the
sum of $5000.
The law. firm of Galpin & Bolton
are mixed up ih the legal tangle, which
almost amounts to a. scandal. Messrs.
Houghton & Houghton, attorneys for
the residuary legatees, are pressing the
fight against the lawyers and executors
and thus far they have been upheld by
the court. On Tuesday last the attor
neys for the legatees appeared before
Judge^offey and demanded that iho
powers of. Executor Frank Garcia be
suspended. He is alleged to hav*
brought about all the trouble. Judge
Coffey postponed "action until the 2f.tl-f
in order that the executors might obey
the order he made to return the mon
eys they drew from the Donohoe-Kelly
Banking Company's bank.
