Motor Breaks Down and in Descending
Balloon and Car Land in Bay.
DR. AUGUST' GRETH, an amateur aeronaut of San
Francisco, ascended in > a dirigible balloon yesterday to
a height of 2000 feet and sailed over the city; controll
ing his rinachine. perfectly tint il his motor broke down. He
was then compelled to let the gas escape from the balloon,
and descended in the waters of the straits near Fort Point.
A crew from the life-saving station rescued him and his air
ship. He claims tJmt if equipped with a proper motor his
craft will be subject entirely to his, control at any altitude and
can be driven in any desired, direction at a high rate of speed.
"I am going to He down for a little
while," he said as he alighted from the
car^^iand then I will make a free ascent
and sail around The Call building."
The airship was secured with lines and
the navigator sought repose in a room
fitted up for him on the grounds. Within
an hour he appeared again, much re
freshed, and mounted the car again. This
time no rope dangled from the airship.
When the moorings were cast loose the
bulky envelope rose rapidly In the air,
dragging the car after It, and ascended to
a height of 2000 feet.
VOYAGER IS CHEERED.
A large crowd gathered outside of the
grounds and cheered the plucky voyager,
who stood leaning over the side of the
car waving his hand to the people below
him. The ascent was made at 10:50 o'clock.
An American flag attached to the car
floated lazily in the still air. At 2000 feet
Dr. Greth started the motor, and the
craft answered to the motions of its pro.
pellers by descending several hundred feet
and turning in a semicircle, first to the
north and then ; to; the south. After
maneuvering a little the navigator point
ed the nose of the craft toward the north
west, set . the propellers to steer ahead
and the airship shot forward in the direc
tion of the Presidio.

IN CRATER OF MAUNALOA
Party of Excursionists Reaches Sum

Rather Difficult Trip.
HONOLULU. Oct. IS.â An exploring
party of thirteen, the first to reach Mo
kuapopo. the summit of the crater of
Maunaloa, gives reliable details of the
eruption. The party suffered severely
from mountain sickness and cold. They
found the inside of the crater very active.
Out of the mass of molten lava fiery gey
sers were shooting up to the height of
200 feet or more, but there was no over
flow.

they fairly hugged themselves . in their
delight It was these men who, from their
scanty means, had furnished the capital
for the construction of the airship and
had v studied and tolled for many- long
months in the accomplishment of their
design. Time and again they had made
arrangements for the test, only to be dis
appointed by- some breakdown or other ' in
the machinery- Funds had run lowland
friends of the project, discouraged by the
repeated failures, | had refused i to contrib
ute further. By dint of the hardest per
suasion Dr. \ Greth and his partner, J.
Ozro Brubaker, the artist, secured suffi
cient money to complete arrangements for
the trial trip. , it was agreed among the
promoters that an ascent would be made
at 9:30 o'clock J Sunday morning from the
lot at Eleventh and Market streets.
At the 'time mentioned thirty or forty
interested people gathered In the rear of
the premises at 1517 Market street. Among
them were Dr. Greth and his family, J.
Ozro Brubaker,' several mechanics who
had: contributed .their services in the con
struction of the airship, and a few who

Mf U y to his confidence through an
&JÂ£f nouncement of his intentions,
*** r9 *^ r Dr. August Greth climbed in
to his dirigible airship yester
day morning, cast loose all stays and
anchors and sailed away into â¢ the blue
vault of heaven. The residents of San
Francisco who turned their eyes skyward
on the beautiful Sabbath morning were
startled to see an elliptical balloon, to
which was attached a car, careening 2000
feet above their heads. Rushes were made
for field and opera glasses and half the
population of the city watched the amaz
ing spectacle.
It was evident at once that whoever was
directing the strange conveyance had it
completely under his control. It was
made to rise and fall at the will of the
operator, turned first to one side, then
the other, speeded at a high rate . and
slacked until it scarcely moved. The
hand that guided the wanderings of- the
marvelous craft was master of the atmos
phere and had solved the vexed problem
pt aerial navigation, "Â¦Â¦ "*\
While the whole city was wondering a
little group of men in the vacant lot at
Market and Eleventh streets watched
with beating hearts the ascent and Jour
ney of the craft, and when it was evi
dent that It was going to be a success
PROMOTERS JUBILANT.
Speculation was rife regarding the chai*
acter of the strange conveyance and the
gallant skipper of the air who directed
its movements. Scarcely one of the
watchers had ever heard of the airship
and its inventor. It burst on the city
without the ieast warning and many men
who had tarried with the Wurzburger
late Saturday night doubted the evidence
of their eyes. They thought they were
seeing thlng3.
The airship took its flight from Market
and Eleventh streets, across the western
portion of the city, sometimes attaining
a height of 2000 feet, and descending at in
tervals to a height of about 1000 feet. For
nearly an hour it floated about, curveting
in the sunshine like a colt in a pasture,
and then sank from sight behind the Pre
sidio.
Ascension Is Made Without Notice and Navigator Seems to
Have Complete Control of His Craft.
The life-saving crew from the station at
Fort Point put out a boat to the rescue.
Dr. Greth refused to leave the balloon
and the apparatus was , towed to the
beach, where the navigator climbed out.
Some soldiers who had followed the
flight of the airship caught the balloon
and pulled It ashore, where the gas soon
escaped from It and allowed It to collapse.
The balloon and the car were subsequent
ly loaded on a wagon by Dr. Greth and
navigator sailing along as he pleased,
ducking about in the, air with freedom.
Occasionally he would lean over the side
of the car. and wave his hat to the curious
watchers below him. As he neared a point
over the Presidio he could be seen work
ing in the cordage, and the balloon was
noticed to . ascend rapidly. Suddenly it
commenced to sink, rapidly at first and
then more slowly. The motor, which
could be heard working, stopped suddenly
and the balloon, still sinking, drifted over
the -Presidio and out over the waters of
the straits. Slowly it descended Into the
water. Dr. Gerth, apparently as cool as
If alighting from a street car, swung from
his station into the rigging of the bal
loon, which floated along on top of the
water. â¢.:,..* ,

swung the car, in which .was located a
Brennan gasoline ten horsepower motor.
On each side of the car at the top was a
propeller, connected with each other by a
shaft and operated by a sprocket attached
to the motor. The motor weighed 500
pounds, .and the car supports another. 500
pounds^ -With the weight of the navi
gator, the total load was. 1200 pounds, 600
pounds below the carrying capacity of the
balloon: Â¦ \ , : .*/- i ;
.When'all arrangements were concluded
Dr.' Greth climbed Into the car and the
apparatus ascended into the air, but was
held . by a cable from below. It was an
ndunced that the navigator would do some
maneuvering while anchored. The airship
ascended to a height of 400 feet, where he
held jt^ stationary for. a time. Then he
turned repeatedly, within. the length of his
machine,- rose :'and fell at -..will, started
and stopped,' the bulky craft apparently
answering to the lightest touch. Al
though anchored the maneuvering was
practically a free ascent, as the rope was
"never taut and did not assist the balloon
In any way In its movements. After half
an hour of this the airship descended, the
descent being aided by , willing hands on
the} rope. Dr. Greth was worn out by his
work /with f, the motor t 'which gave him
much' trouble.

BALTIMORE, Oct. 18.â Secretary Shaw
has Quietly dropped from the roll of em
ployes of the Treasury Department the
name of Cal Gorman, a brother of Sen

known caused comment in view of the
published criticism by Senator Gorman of
President Roosevelfs alleged Interference
in Maryland political affairs. Some per
sons not acquainted with the facts
jumped to the conclusion that the Sen
ator's brother had been dismissed because
of the attack on Mr. Roosevelt.
As a matter of fact, Gorman was oust

SEEKS SUBOEON'S AID Â«
AND LANDS IN JAIL
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18.â Commissioner
Richards of the General Land Offlce to
day . gave out the following statement
concerning the policy and practice of the
land offlce io the matter of the withdraw
al of the public lands from settlement:
There seems to be a misapprehension respect-
Ing â¢ withdrawals of public lands from entry
under certain of thÂ« land laws and suspension
of final action upon certain classes of entries
already made. Generally speaking, land is
withdrawn from entry In order to prevent it*
being appropriated In a manner or for a pur
pose not contemplated by the law.
In consequence of a proposed forest re*ervÂ«
a withdrawal Is made of all the land that
will probably be included in its boundaries In
order to guard against speculative entries
made for the purpose of obtaining Hen land.
Withdrawals under the Irrigation act arÂ«
for the purpose of reserving the land for home
stead entry â the only kind permitted by the
act. and to prevent speculative entries. Land
containing oil or minerals is withdrawn from
agricultural entry as mineral lands and are
sold in smaller quantities and at higher prices
than farming lands.
Occanionally certain areas are withdrawn
from entry under the desert land act upon evi
dence that the land Is not arid land and un
productive without irrigation, which alone can
be taken under such act.
Final action Is often suspended upon In
dividual entries or a class of entries In certain
localities pending an investigation as to
whether or not there has been a complianca
with the requirements of the law. There* is
no withdrawal of land in this connection or
any suspension of the law nor Interference
with entries properly made.
In November, 1802, ther* was such a suspen
sion of final action upon entries made under tha
timber and stone act in Washington. Oregon
and California. This suspension Â¦ was made
upon evidence of collusive entries In thosa
States whereby individuals and corporations
were obtaining title to large areas of valuable
timber land, whereas tha law provides tha
entry shall be made for the exclusive* use and
benefit of the entryman.
That this action did not hinder or Interfere
with nntrles under this net Is shown by tha
fact that white there were 2197 timber and
stone entries made in the States named during
the Steal year ended June 30, 1902, there wera
6145 such entries made In those States during
the fiscal year ended June 30. 1903. and of this
latter number 3544 entries were made after
January 1, 1903, while the order of suspension
was in force, while but 2197 such entries were
made in the entire fiscal year 1002.
As fast as the entries in these States can b*
examined all of those which have been properly
made are passed to patent, while the suspen
sion continues as to the others pending a hear
ing in the local land office. No cancellation
is made upon report of a special agent until
opportunity for a hearing has been afforded
tha entryman. : ,
ST. LOUIS. Oct. 18.â It is believed by
the police that the mystery of the mur
der, of Mrs. Kate Lauman, whose body^
was found lying by the roadside near
Normandy oh Thursday, has been par
tially solved through the suicide to-day
of. John Williams, a negro, arrested late
last night as a suspect.
Williams, who said he had recently
come from Mississippi, made, several at
tempts; to sell a revolver yesterday and
this'. aroused: suspicion. He was taken
into, custody, and placed in the Clayton
Jail last n'Kht. He asserted his inno
cence, 'but finally, under severe question
ing, made the remark, "Well, thÂ«re are
others in this. I Will tell you more
about It to-morrow."
A small fire occurred near the jail this
forenoon and caused some excitement.
After it had been extinguished. Sheriff
Hencken went to Williams' cell to ques
tion him and found the prisoner dead.
He had hanged himself. It is thought
that the e xcltemflnt caused by the flre
alarmed Williams into a belief that a mob
was approaching the jail to lynch him,
and he quickly hanged himself with a
sheet. His body was warm when dis
covered.
Acting on the possible clew uttered by
Williams, the police are now searching
for othors implicated.
The body of Mrs. Lauman was buried
to-day.

An early morning "sacrifice of praise
and prayer" was held In the garden, when
COOO persons were In attendance.
Dowie filled the garden to-night with an
audience which equaled the great throng
at the afternoon meeting. In a lengthy
Invocation he implored divine blessing on
the mission of the host, on the workers
and on the metropolis. The Invocation
was followed by the hymn, "All Power Is
Given Unto Thee." .
Mrs. Dowie, known to the followers of
her husband as "Overseer. Jane Dowie,"
read from the Gospel of St. Mark the
first chapter and the first fifteen verses.
Dowie made a long prayer, at the close
of which many hundreds of persons left
the building. Dowie again remonstrated
with those who were leaving and asked
them to do him the courtesy to remain
until the end of the meeting.
The subject of the discourse was "Re
pentance," and Dr. Dowie's text was from
Scriptural passages having reference to
the teaching and promised teaching of
Elijah.
The general overseer asked every one
who wished to repent and wished to â¢ be
paved to rise, and many responded. The
meeting closed with a hymn, the benedic
tion and shouts of "Peace be unto you,"
and "Peace unto you be multiplied."

They began to aak who Christ was. Is not
he the ton of old Joseph the carpenter we all
know? This is Jesus, thÂ« son of old Joseph.
And they talked with each other. And they
told him to get out of there, and he stood

"Get out of here." I won't get. They said to

and driving me out In & hearse. Bless, your
life I am the only minister forty-two mile*
from Chicago that newspapers hunger to get
even a word from. At the last Mayoralty elec

GOES AFTER THE CHURCHES.
With his arms above his head, in a
shrill voire that reached the farthest
parts of the garden, he cried:
Now. the people who havÂ« gone away they
could not have gone because of what I said,
for I was reading what God eald.- Ears they
had. but they heard not. I am going to make
them hear. . ,
Dowie strode across the platform and
pointed his finger, shaking it- at the
woman to whom he 6houted. Then he con
tinued: . Â¦ .- : .:.
"Well, let us keep the auiet audience
we have," said the preacher. Dowie took
his text from the third chapter of the
Book of Revelations, the twentieth verse:
Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If
any man hear my voice and open the door I
Â¦will -come Into- him and will, sup with, him
and he with me.
Then walking back and forth In front
of his pulpit, he began:
EyeÂ« have they, yet they b*Â« not. Ear* have
they, yet they near not.
I shall esk the gentlemen of the press to be
have and not to talk. I am not one who. Is con
cerned much about the audlei.je he speaks to,
but I am going- to have a quiet audience now,
you'd better believe. EH down, madame, you
just cit down.
No on* entered
SCOLDS HIS AUDIENCE.
The pervice of prayer opened with the
Invocation, by Dowie. followed by the
singing of' a hymn, during which the
crowd continued to pour into the garden.
This was followed by the recital of the
creed and the Commandments and the
reading of Scripture, during which hun
dreds of persons started to leave the hall,
creating much confusion. The exodus
continued, in sDlte of repeated orders to
close the doors, until nearly a third of
the audience had departed, many of the
vacant seats being filled with the waiting
crowd outside. After order had been
somewhat restored. Dowie said:
If this Is New York and this la a. typical
New York con&re*a.tion 1 am In the face of a
new experience. I think that some of the
people that came in thought this was a Buf
falo Bill Fhow. I wonder If the congregations

and will be orepaxed hereafter. There will be
no more coins; out of the front door. If any
have remained outside let them In. It seems
a i-hair.e they have not the seats the Buffalo
Bill persons hava left.
The procession ascended to the platform
where the choir took position behind the
pulpit and the officers occupied the places
at the sides. When those on the plat
form had taken their places Dowie as
cended the platform, accompanied by
Overseers Daniel Bryant, J. G. Excell,
A. J. Gladstone Dowie, J. G. Splgner, G.
E. Mason and "W. Hammond Piper, who
took their places behind the pulpit In the
order In which they ascended the rostrum.
Dowie wore the usual white robe with a
black robe above' It.
NEW YORK, Oct 18.â FiTÂ» thousand
persons were turned away from. Madison

persons were In the Garden at 2:30 o'clock,
when the services began with the proces

HISTORIC OF AIRSHIPS.
Successful Flights Have Been Made
by Several Inventors.
Experiments with flying machines and
airships have been In progress for at least
seventy, yetfrs, though the practice proba
bly dates back even further. Hundreds
of aeronauts and inventors have striven
to solve the vital question, yet not until
recent years have the much talked of air
craft been navigated with any degree of
success,
M. Santos-Dumont, the daring Brazil
ian aeronaut, is perhaps the most suc
cessful. Inventor and manipulator of fly
ing machines; that ever lived. Next : to
Dumont rank Stanley Spencer of London,
Lebaudy, the .noted French aeronaut;
Herr Schwartz of Germany, Professor
Langley of the Smithsonian institution
and Carl E. Myers, the balloon builder of
Frankfort.- NY. V
.Each, one of these men has come before
the gaze of the public within the last ten
years and each has met with more or less
success in operating v his own particular
style of machine. , The theories of each
inventor differed widely and their , ma
chines were all patterned and operated on
different lines.
Santos-Dumont made his first ascension
in Paris In 'September, 1898. The initial
trial was not altogether a success, but the
young inventor ," did , hot [ lack , the energy
and t staying' qualities,' iso ' ten " days later
he i again experimented â¢ with his ; machine
and this time he successfully sailed; about
After the release of the gas I tried ; to get
the motor working again, but could not. I
had picked, out a spot in the Presidio where I
Intended landing, but was : caught in a cur
rent of wind and carried out over the straits.
Had my motor been working I could . have
landed handily on the very spot I had chosen.
While I was In the air I could see far out
on the ocean and to the â¢ foothills In Â¦ the east.
I watched the people below me, mere ; specks
on the earth, and was much amused at ; their
gestures of wonder at my appearance. ;\The
Journey and what it has demonstrated made
me the happiest. man in the world/ Â¦ .
As soon as I cÂ£h get a proper motor I am
going to give the. people of San Francisco an
exhibition of aerial navigation, that will sur
prise them. A motor such as I want'. will cost
The other facior was in the balloon itself,
which lacks automatic expansion valves, such
as Santos Dumont's balloons are equipped
with. At an altitude of 2000 feet the gas in
the envelope expanded rapidly under the hot
rays of the sun and j the breakdown In the
motor rendered . the propellers powerless ' to
drive me down to the earth. Under these cir
cumstances I was compelled. to let gas out of
the balloon In order to avoid reaching too
great a height. This was, a tedious process,
as I had fo unlash the mouth of the balloon
and after a sufficient volume of gas had es
caped, lash it up again. Before I did this the
balloon was tense with expanded Â¦ gas and I
was afraid that in the higher altitudes the
added pressure might burst the envelope..'
MOTOR REFUSES TO WORK.
For the greater part of the time that I was
in the air. the balloon was entirely under my
control. It would have been entirely so ex
cept for two factors. In the first place my
motor failed, me, as It has done before. It is
a gasoline motor, weighing COO pounds, and
nominally of ten horse- power. As a matter of
fact It ' develops only six horse-power. ; Under
pressure it stopped working yesterday when
I was at an altitude of 2000 feet.
We are all poor men and we have to guard
against unnecessary expenditures. All we have
In the world has been put Into this project
and it has been hard scraping for all of us
to get funda to go as far as we have.
The ascent in a large sense was successful.
It demonstrated beyond a doubt the practica
bility of my plans for an airship. Defects in
the motor and crude appliances in the balloon
caused the descent to be somewhat disastrous
and In an undesirable place, but those are
matters that a little money will remedy. I
never enjoyed anything in my life as I did
the trip across the city. One cannot imagine
the feeling of exuberance and freedom enjoyed
when one feels that he can sail through the
air at any altitude desired and pilot his craft
as he wills.
PROMOTERS POOR MEN.
I feel splendidly after my trip. I' suffered
not the slightest inconvenience except that I
got wet to my waist when the â¢ ship settled
in the bay. The reason I descended there was
a question of expense.. I could readily have
kept on and landed on the Marln County shore
or over In Oakland, but the expense of bring
ing back our Â¦ apparatus from either of those
places would have been ten times greater than
It was from the Presidio. .
When seen at his home yestorday after
the ascent he talked readily and interest
ingly of the trip and his ambitions. He
said: ,
In manner he is unassuming but terribly
in earnest. For twenty years he has dab
bled In aeronautics and has patents for
nine airships granted to h:m by the Unit
ed States. He is no dreamer or visionary
enthusiast. What he knows of voyaging
in the air he* hfis learned by deep study
and experience and he is certain that the
problem of navigating the atmosphere
needs only a little capital for Its complete
solution.
hauled back to the starting point at Mar
ket and Eleventh streets.
The trial trip, unheralded as it was, was
the "most remarkable and successful ex
periment in aerial navigation that has
ever occurred either in this country or in
Europe. It surpassed In many ways the
feats of . Santos Dumont and Stanley
Spencer and demonstrated beyond a doubt
that an airship can be constructed ac
cording to the plans of Dr. Greth that is
easily dirigible and practicable, and which
will carry passengers at a high rate of
speed.
Ur.til yesterday the inventor and navi
gator of this new craft was practically an
unknown man. Except to a few enthu
siasts who aided him in his labors the
name of Grcth will be strange to aero
nauts. By profession he is a practicing
physician and lives with his family in a
modest flat at 303 Jones street. He is an
Alsatian by birth and about 42 years old.
He is a graduate of a college in France
and also won a degree from the University
of California.
As^farbacK as 1S22 James Bennett, a
Philadelphia man, invented a flying ma
chine,' but he never perfected, it sojthat
it ! could'. be operated with any degree of
safety. -He applied to Congress for .the
exclusive right - to ; make and sell flying
machines, â¢ claiming '.. to , be the only :' man
that ever brought a flying ,-. machine
fore public. < Congress refused to grant
the and soon after } that Bennett
and -his â¢ machine dropped out ; of sight.
Bennett : Is credited Â¦. with making several
ascents in his machine,* but' he died before
it was perfected. .."
Carl Myers,' proprietor of .the noted "bal
loon farm" at Frankfort, N. Y.,' is the in
ventor, of a ; novel balloon machine, egg
shaped, that is propelled by means of
pedals, like a bicycle. Myers has made
several . successful trips " in his machine
and has always been able to command it
with ease. ~'.\_ ' Â¦ â¢ " '"/"
The machine made its ascent in Septem
ber, 1307, in the presence of a number of
prominent officers of the Prussian . army.
It arose without a hitch, but the steering
gear became entangled before the machine
made much progress and the engine also
failed to work, so the ship . fell to the
ground and was totally destroyed.
Had Schwartz lived there 13 no doubt
but that his machine would have been a
success. No one knew of . his plans, and
when he died before the machine was
fully completed several of the army of
ficers undertook to work out theories of
their own. They undid much of the work
that Schwartz had spent years at,/ and
therefore the machine was finished on en
tirely different lines, and its failure was
expected by many who had made the
question a study.
The : Stanley-Spencer machine has at-:
tracted much attention lately andits In
ventor has made many successful trips in
It. Spencer's airship Is constructed much
after the lines of Santos-Dumont's. The
principal dlfflculty; its inventor expe
rienced In navigating it was steering and
turning around. He made numerous at
tempts to circle about towers, but most
of them were unsuccessful, as the steer
ing gear of the machine failed to work at
the critical moment.
He continued to build airships from that
time on and completed several more, all
of them being successful. The last one,
in which he flew around the Eiffel tower
last-year, is considered the best that, has
yet been constructed. With this machine
Santos-Dumont has successfully demon
strated that a flying machine can be eas
ily navigated and can battle against the
various wind currents.
Professor Langley's machine has not
been- ho much of a success as that of the
Brazilian's, but the Smithsonian man has
confidence in his ability to perfect his ap
paratus and according to his own state
ment when he remedies a few lesser de
fects It will fly successfully.
Langley's machine is a novel one and
constructed on entirely different lines
from that of Santos-Dumont. It is a huge
kite-like affair, Â«havlng no gas bag to sus
tain It; with four Immense wings or sails,
and Is operated by motor power, supplied
by a small engine. It cost a small for
tune, to equip the machine and the ex
penditure may be doubled before It is
brought to a degree of perfection.
The airship built and designed by the
late Herr Schwartz was the most ponder
ous ever completed. It was constructed of
aluminum and weighed 5700 pounds. It
was 135 feet long and forty-five feet In
diameter, and its inventor spent many
years in constructing it, but died before
his hopes of sailing the air were realized.
Schwartz" was a noted Prussian Inventor

the suburbs of Paris for many miles,
though the machine finally gave out.
These two trials gave Santos-Dumont
much experience and soon after, he built
the Santos-Dumont No. 2. This machine
was much more successful than the first
and he made many ascensions in It and
the eyes of the scientific world were soon
turned on Paris and the brilliant young
South American. '
Even with my poor motor I held my machine
yesterday against a 'strong current of wind,
although I drifted considerably. The propellers
my plans call tor are all to be run by one
motor In the body of the car. The French
have succeeded best In making high-power mo
tors of light weight, but there are cheaper
ones made in the United States that will an
swer the purpose In these tests.
For $.1000 I can build a machine that will
be capable of defending the harbor of San
Francisco from the attack of the combined
fleets of the world. It could sail over the .ships
at a height beyond the range of their guns and
drop high-power explosives down on them that
would send them to the bottom In short order.
Â¦ The spirit of the age demands the solution
of the aerial navigation problem. The needs
of travel call for something 'better than rail
ways and steamships. As the Pullman sur
passes the prairie schooner bo will airships
surpass railroads. Many brilliant ' men have
set themselves to mastering this mode of
transportation and their combined efforts must
prevail. My experiment shows how near we
are to the solution. Within a short space of
time airships . will be as common and an
dirigible as automobiles are now.
I have studied this subject seriously for
twenty years and I have come to the conclu
sion that the only practicable airship la one
that gains its support from some gas lighter
than the air. Flying machine* that are ex
pected to sustain Â¦ themselves by their ' own
power I do not expect to see. The Impossi
bility of securing .sufficient sustaining power
in this line of airships without Increasing the
weight in proportion seems to be an insuper
able obstacle. The only Â¦ hope for the gasless
airship seems to He in the discovery of some
new force Â¦ greater than steam, electricity j or
compressed air. â¢
But a dirigible airship buoyed up by a
balloon is not a theory any longer. My ma
chine â¢ will answer all requirements If prop
erly equipped, and I expect to attain high rates
of speed and the ability to go through the air
under all kind's of atmospheric conditions In
any direction I please. _.
SAILS AGAINST WIND.
$1000. and with that I will demonstrate con
clusively that I can Ball an airship at will at
a ' speed of thirty miles an hour In a perfect
calm. In favoring currents my speed will bo
increased by just the ':. velocity of the wind.
The ship can be sailed at any altitude desired
and thus advantage can be taken of the dif
ferent currents 1 in the -atmosphere."
What I am telling: you Is not the dream of a
visionary. . I am Intensely practical in this
matter, and I make It a point to underestimate
rather than overstate all that is possible with
my craft. This present machine Is a make
shift and falls far short of what my plans
contemplate. The most Important feature lack
ing !s a proper motor. Samps Dutnont has
a 30-horsepower motor weighing 300 pounds.
If I had that motor I could ko where 1 please
through the air. He also has automatic ex
pansion controllers and has no need to worry
nliout his balloon. The pressure will remain
the tame at every altitude and through every
change of temperature.
Owing to my lack of motive power I was
compelled to do with two propellers and at
tach these to the sides of the car. My plans
call for four propellers, two at each end of
the frame. These can be worked together or
separately and at any desired angle, so that
the siilp can be turned in any direction and
held there even against a strong wind. ,.

The court will be convened to-morrow
in the Senate Chamber, and unless some
change Is made In the present plan It
will be open to the public. The case of
General John Chase will be taken up first.
$0 far - General Chase is the only officer
against whom charges have been officially
filed with the court. He is charged with
failure to obey orders of the Governor,
conduct unbecoming to an officer and
perjury.
There was some talk of compromising
the whole affair without a trial, under
an agreement with Chase, to resign
shortly after matters had quieted down.
In reply to this rumor. General Chaae
satd: "I shall not resign from the Na
tional Guard. All reports to the effect
that I had ever considered offering my
resignation are entirely false. There will
be no compromise , from my end of the
line'lf such compromise calls for my re
tirement." : ;
This occurred early yesterday afternoon
and for several hours the little ones, igno

ent was enduring, continued to pick the
apples. They then went to the house and
were alarmed to find no sign of their
mother. When the father, a well known
farmer, returned from an adjoining ranch,
he instantly began a search of the ranch.
The woman's body was soon found near
an old well. One of her hands clutched a
strand of a barbed wire fence. She had
evidently wandered about after taking the
poison and had stumbled Into the well. A
few boards had prevented her from
drowning and she was enabled to reach
the surface again. '

Dr. Alexander J. Mclvor-Tyndall's psy
chological lecture on the subject of
"Moneyâ The Psychic Law Governing It"
attracted an excellent audience to Stein
way Hall last evening. The lecture
proved to be a practical and conservative
exposition of the' money question viewed
from the standpoint of a man who has
made a life study of the questions that
affect human character and spiritual pro.
gress. Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall's views are
alwaj-3 Intensely interesting, and from the
hypothesis of mental science no doubt
they are also practicable. He holds the
idea that as "man has dominion over all
the earth" he is able at all times to cre
ate that which Is needed for his progress
and happiness. This he considers literal
ly, and he believes that one can so use
his own psychic and mental powers as to
attract to himself money, which Is merely
a substitute for' all material things, at
will. The lecture was well received, as
have been all the lectures of the series
given here by the celebrated scientist,
the audience being: particularly enthu
siastic over the truly wonderful demon
strations of psychic power exhibited by
the thought-reader. Next Sunday even

Japanese and Russian securities, after a
rapid decline had as rapid a recovery.
Americans and Kaffirs participated fully
in the general recovery of prices, steel

Byec'-aJ IÂ«!-pÂ«tc!j to The Call
PORTLAND. Or.. Oct. IS.â The Rev. J.
John A. Gibson, pastor of the Grand
aveoue Presbyterian Church, is defendant
In a damage suit for $1000 filed in the
State Circuit Court by W. E. Splcer. a
local wheat broker and member of the
congregation, who alleges that the min
ister has made numerous defamatory ut
terances regarding him and has wrong
fully attempted to expel him and his wife
from the church society.
The complaint recites that Gibson re
cently said to a prominent member of the
congregation. "Mr. Miller, don't you
know that Splcer is a bad man and If he
had his Just deserts he would be behind
the bars at the penitentiary at Salem?"
The complaint proceeds to "say that at a
meeting of the church later Mr. Gibson
asked the congregation to grant certifi
cates of dismissal from the church to
Spicer and his wife who were members
in good standing. It Is averred that thij
action on the part of the pastor Vas In
tended to convey the meaning that SpJ
ccr was a bad man and an unfit person
to be a member of the church and that
he should be expelled therefrom.
A number of years ago Splcer went
from Portland to Wardner. Idaho, where
he engaged In the wheat business. He
eventually lost money and turned over
a brick building at Wardner and other
securities to one of the banks. The of
ficers of the bank afterward had Splcer
arrested for disposing of certain wheat
in a warehouse. Splcer was tried and ac
quitted in the State Circuit Court. His
defense was that he had a right to sell
the wheat and* that the bank was more
than secured for the amount he owed it.

An excellent programme had been ar
ranged, consisting of a tombola, dancing
and an. oration by Fiorenzo Cavagnaro.
Mr. Cavagnaro's address was most for
cible and hÂ© was vociferously applauded.
ThÂ« speaker dwelt upon trials that had
beset Columbus in his voyage to the new
land and the difficulty that he had en
countered in convincing the skeptics so
as to secure sufficient funds to make the
attempt. He reminded his countrymen
that, notwithstanding the natural love
they had for the country of their birth,
they should not fail in their duty as
American citizens. In conclusion he
pointed out that Columbus was guided by
a divine hand on his perilous voyage
across the trackless ocean so that a gov
ernment might be founded where the op
pressed of all nations could find a haven
of refuge and where justice, equality and
liberty should prevail.
The committees in charge of the cele
bration were as follows:
If the shade of Christopher Columbus
had visited Glen Park yesterday it would
have been overcome by emotion at the
splendid manner in which the great dis
coverer's countrymen of the present day
united to do honor to his memory on the
411th anniversary of his discovery of
America, The celebration was under the
auspices of the Garibaldi Guard Mutual
Aid Society and no unpleasant Incident
occurred to mar the day's festivities.
The Garibaldi Guard members, In their
handsome scarlet uniforms and" under
command of Captain Delucchi. assembled
at Garibaldi Hall on Broadway at 9
o'clock, and, headed by a brass band and
followed by the members of the society,
paraded on Broadway, Dupont and Fil
bert streets, Montgomery avenue and
Kearny street. Cars were in waiting
after the parade and an early start was
made for Glen Park.
ENDS HER LIFE
NEAR CHILDREN
LOOKS DOWN REVOLVER.
I was behind the bar In the act of drawing
a glass of beer when some one stepped out
of the little door that leads into the front of
the store. This door Is on a line with- the
space behind the bar so that a man can step
from the front of the store directly behind the
bar In cane there Is a customer In the saloon
part. The men stepped directly alongside of
me and put a revolver almost against my
head. At first I thought that It was some one
In the neighborhood who was putting up a
Joke on me. and I threw up my hand to
ward him off. In doing that I brushed his
mask aside a little and I' saw that he was a
young man with a light moustache and I am
sure that I could recognize him without the
least trouble.
Just as I threw up my hand and knocked
the gun of the first man aside the second
man stepped In through the door from the
â¢treet. He also had a revolver ready, and
aiming It at me he said: -'Throw up your
hands and quit that or I'll put tome lead Into
you."
I saw that they meant business, and with
The only theory that is advanced is that
the men who held up the saloon at Point
Richmond caugnt a freight train for Oak
land and decided to rob the engineer and
fireman Just before the train reached the
end of Its run. The men who robbed
Kley's saloon at West Oakland are also
supposed to be the ones who held up
Larue A. Cross, a young man, at the cor
ner of Thirteenth and Castro streets later
in the evening.
The first robbery reported was that of
the Kley saloon. This crime occurred a
few minutes before 7 o'clock and it was
reported to the police as soon as the
thieves had left the place. The report of
the robbery of the engine crew of the
freight train was made to the Oakland
police as soon as the train reached the
Sixteenth-street depot, which was nearly.
1 o'clock. The robbery of young Cross at
the corner of Thirteenth and Castro
streets occurred at 2 o'clock in the morn
ing. and was reported almost Immediately
at the City Hall by Cross himself. Word
of the Point Richmond robbery did not
reach this city until this morning.
The robbery of Kley's saloon was
daring, particularly because of the time
of the evenins in which it was done.
Nussbaum, the barkeeper and a son-in
law of the proprietor of the olace, at
first thought that it was only a joke,
but when a second man with a mask and
revolver appeared at another door he
discovered that It was a stern reality
and gave up the contents of the money
drawer, amounting to between $50 and $60.
Nussbaum started to make a fight when
he thought that there was but one man
present, but when the second man en
tered the door directly in front of him
and threatened to shoot he yielded. Nuss
baum tells a very clear story of the rob
bery. He said:
In every' case the robbers were masked
with handkerchiefs over (their faces, and
this, together with the excitement of the
moment, makes descriptions upon which
the police may work very uncertain. In
the case of the robbery of Kley's saloon
at West Oakland, Fred Nussbaum. the
barkeeper, claims that he got a look at
one of the men and would be able to
recognize him.
The most definite clew upon which to
work is In the Point Richmond case.
Deputy Sheriff Moitoza of that place fol
lowed the men who are supposed to have
robbed the Spignelia saloon there into
West Berkeley. There he overtook them
and he claims that he recognized them.
He claims they are Walter and William
Nottingham, the last named being an ex
convict, who goes under the alias of
"Billy Woods." The police are now look
ing for these men, but the clews in the
other cases are very slight.
THEORY OF POLICE.
Masked mÂ»n were coming from all di
rections, revolvers and knives flashed, and
the police upon this side of the bay were
kept on the anxious seat all night, hardly
knowing from what direction the next re
port of a robbery might come. To-day
detectives, special men and Deputy
Sheriffs have been working upon clews
and Insufficient descriptions, with but
little success.
Two of thÂ« robberies were In saloons,
and barkeepers and patrons were made to
surrender- their coin at the muwles of
revolvers. The third was the robbery of
the engineer and fireman of a freight
train and the fourth was an attack upon
a cltisen In a central part of the city of
Oakland.
land, one at the stockyards near
West Berkeley and the fourth at Point
Richmond.

PRESS OF DOMINION
BITTER OVER DECISION
It ia possible that this robbery may have
been committed by the men from Point
Richmond. The trail of these men was
lost near where the train robbery oc
curred and the train robbery took placa
shortly after they dropped out of sight in
the darkness of West Berkeley.
The robbery of the engineer and firemen
of a special freight train at the stock
yards was a little out of the run of train
robberies. The thieves secured a little
money and even took some of the clothes
of their victims.
The appearance of the second man set
tled the question of whether it was
business or fun, and four pairs of hands
went up over four heads. One man kept
the crowd covered with his revolver
while the other took $12 95 from the money
drawer. They then searched Mr. Spig
nolia and found a buckskin sack with
$150 in gold coin in his pocket, "which they
took.
"I suppose that you want my gold
watch,' 1 said Spignolia, who expected to
lose everything.
"No. we don't want any jewelry," 6aid
one of the robbers.
The men in the saloon were then warned
not to leave the saloon upon penalty of
being shot as they emerged, and the rob
bers disappeared.
Deputy Sheriff Frank Moitoza was nott
fied in about half an hour, and he secured
a buggy and began to follow the men. He
traced them along Richmond avenue,
which branches, one road leading to Oak
land, the other to San Pablo. Thinking
that they would head for the city," Moitoza
turned toward Oakland and at the corner
ot University avenue and San Pablo ave
nue in West Berkeley he overtook two
men, who .were hurrying on foot and
seemed very much out of breath. He rec
ognized them as Walter and William Not
tingham. The last named served a term
of eight years in State's prison for rob
bing (he Southern Pacific Railroad sta
tion at Walnut Creek and was sentenced
from Contra Costa County under the
name of "Billy Woods."
Moitoza ordered the men to stop, and
when he did they began firing at him.
There was a volley of shots exchanged
without any one being hurt, and the two
men Jumped into a gully and made their
scape. Moitoza thinks that they were the
men that did the job.
THE TRAIN ROBBERY.
These. Jokes did not please the man be
hind tfcii mnnk, who was looking for
money and not for fun. He uttered a few
oaths such as usually go with like pieces
of work, and Just then another man with
a revolver and his face hidden by a mask
entered another door and added his in
structions about throwing up hands.
OBEY THE ROBBERS..
Spignolia runs the Manhattan Hotel,
In what Ik known as the Old Town, and
has a saloon in the building. It was a
little after 10:30 o'clock last night, and
the proprietor wae playing cards with
Joe McAvoy, Mike Phelan and Joe
Brlttan, three employes of the Santa Fe
Railroad, when the robbers entered. There
was no one else in the room except the
four card players, when a man with a
handkerchief tied over his face and a
revolver in his hand entered a door that
was' directly behind Splgnolla. He com
manded: "Throw up your hands."
The men at the table thought that it
was a Joke and one man remarked: "I've
got a hand right here I'd like to throw
up."- Another suggested "Blaze away"
and a third said: "I'd rather be shot in
the back."
They were of medium slse. both dressed in
dark clothes. One wore a' black handkerchief
over his face and the other a white one. The
man with the black mask came in first and
had a blue revolver. The man who came In
second had a white mask and a bright re
volver. The second man seemed to be more
determined than the first one and seemed to
be the leader.
You can Just bet that It was excitingâ but
then business has been fine to-day. There are
a lot of people who came down to the sa
loon to see, where the holdup occurred, and
they all spent money. â¢>
â¢ The holdup of S. G. Spignolia's saloon
in Point Richmond was Just as exciting
as the Oakland incident of similar char
acter.
BOTH OF MEDIUM' SIZE.
two -guns on ma I quit. I am frank to say
that those guns looked as big as cannons to
tne, and when 1 realized that they meant
what they tali) I quit.
They turned tnt. so I factfd the wall, and
one, of them kept his revolver on me while
the other man took all the money them was
in the. drawer, amounting to between $50 and
$60. He also took $8 from Louis Davis, who
was in th* saloon. Joe McCutcheon and Ar
thur Beauchamp. who were also present, had
nothing to glvÂ« up.
The m*n told us that if we moved or tried
to follow them that they would shoot us as
wÂ« cam*- out of the place. We notified the
police by telephone as soon as we got our
breath, but the men were out of sight long
before .that. The men were probably In the
place twenty minutes, and they seemed very
cool and In no hurry about anything.
Lame A. CrDss. pon of a prominent phy
sician of Stockton, who wan stopping at
the Albany Hotel, was held up at the cor
ner of Thirteenth and Castro streets
shortly after midnight this morning. In
the struggle attending the hold-up Cross
received a deep gash on the palm of. the
left hand from a knifo with which one of
the footpads was trying to kill him.
Cross left the hotel nbout 10:30 o'clock,
intending to take a walk before retiring.
He was walking along Thirteenth street
on his way to the hotel when, as he
reached' the corner of Castro street, a man
steppe'd out from the shadow of a tree
ana. throwing out one hand, said: "Throw
up your hands!" What followed is best
told in the words of the young man him
self. He said:
When the thug told me to throw up my
hands, of course I thought he had a gun. and
put up my hands as he ordered. As I did Â»o
another man stepped out of the shadow and
started to search me. I had about $40 with
me and the thief took this. Then seeing a
silver key chain under my coat, he evidently
thought It might hold a money locket and he
dragged it out. Seeing that It only held a
bunch of keys the fellow gave the chain a
rough JÂ«?rk, breaking it, and handed me back
the keys. Just as he gave me the keys the
man that I thought had- the gun came out of
the shadow. I saw that he had nothing in
his hands, bo I struck the fellow that was
searching me. knocking him down, but in fall-
Ing he managed to grab me and pull me with
him. As I fell I. saw the other man draw
something from under his coat, and tha next
thing I knew he was trylng,to cut me.
He gashed my clothes In several places and
finally made a slash at my throat, but I
caught the blade of the knife and stopped the
blow but when he Jerked the knife away my
hand' was cut to the bone. Then both of them
broke away and ran down Castro street and I
went to the City Hall and gave the alarm and
then had my hand dressed.
I told him to go over and shut off the water,
but ho said: "What do you think I am. a
fool?" -
While we were talking the men got down
from the engine on the other side, and Just
then the head brakeman came along with his
lamp and I heard him say: "What are you
fellows doing?. Get out of there." One of the
men -answered* "I'll show you what we're do
ing. Throw up your hands." Then I saw the
brakeman's light go out and heard him make
a run for the caboose.
Then the robbers hurried away and the fire
man And I went back to the engine. We found
our lockers open and all our street clothes were
gone. I had ?10 in the pocket of my pants,
and of course that was gone, too. Then we
got stoam up and set out the cars and started
for Oakland.
When the fellow that came Into the cab cams
over the tank J noticed that he had a handker
chief tied over his face, but I thought he was
some hobo with a toothache and didn't pay any
attention to the fact. It was so dark on top
ot the tank that I could not tell whether the
others wore masks or cot.
BRAKEMAN MAKES A RUN.
When we came back we climbed up and
looked over the fence and could see the three
men In the cab. The water, had been running
Into the boiler all the time and the fireman
said to m-: "Say. Bob, she'll be pretty full
of water."
In answer he shoved his hand Into his shirt
and pulled a big Colt's revolver and shoved
It Into my fare, saying: "I'll show you what
right I've got to rid*. Throw up your hands.
I want you." â
As he raid this he made a grab for my watch
chain, which showed Inside of my Jumper, but
he got hold of the Jumpcri instead. That made
me think of my watch and I made up my mind
to get away If I could, and I said: "Well. If
ycu want me you've got to get me," and with
that T went head first out of the window.
While the fellow In the cab was talking the
two fellows on the tank had drawn guns and
covered us so I knew it was no use making
a flght. Â¦ . Â¦
My engine was one of the big compounds,
and it was lucky for me that It was or I could
not have got through the window. When I hit
the ground I Jumped up and run forward In
the shadow o? th* engine till I got to the pilot
and then ran across the tracks toward the
high Doard fence around the ell refinery. As
I got to the opposite side of the engjne I saw
the fireman going for the fence on the run.
When we got to the fence the fireman gave me
a hoot so 1 could reach the top, and then I
pulled him up, and we got down and hunted
around for a watchman or telephone so that
we could get help, but we couldn't find a soul.
The fireman and I were laughing at him be
rause he was 50 clumsy, and as he got on his
feet I said to him: "Who gave you the right
to ride on that tank? 1 ' â¢
DRAWS HIS REV0LVEE.
WhetTth* robbers itot up on the tank two
of them' stopped and one came on to the cab.
When he got to the end or the tank he turned
his back to us and started to climb down onto
the deck of the engine, but he slipped and fell
Into the cab and in some way got his foot
caught In the box that we use to carry sand
In. and I noticed that he had on high lace
shoes.
-I dldn"t pay much attention to them, as I
thought they were hoboes after a drink of
water or a smoke, for there are always a lot
or them riding with us from one station to
another. They wait until the train starts and
then swing; on and ride until th* brakeman
gets wise and Rives them the run. and when
we stop they often come to the engine and be&
a Â»moke or a drink of water.
MVÂ« pulled Into the dockyard* slowly, us we
had to Mop there and eÂ«t Out Â«lx cars of stock.
Just as I shut the engine off and turned thÂ»
water Into the boiler I saw three fellows come
up on the track, the engine being an oil burn
er, and come toward the cab.

SACRAMENTO, Oct. IS.â One vOf the
largest shooting festivals that has taken
place In this State was inaugurated to
day by the Sacramento Helvetia Rifle
Club. The prizes offered were of such
a valuable nature ' that marksmen were
induced to enter from different parts of.
the State. The light during the day was
somewhat variable and the wind was so
light that the smoke often settled on the
range and it was with difficulty the ex
perts centered their shots. Tho contests
were held on the point and honorary tar
gets.
There Is an exciting contest on for king
ship honors. F. E. Mason, A. Strecker,
E. Schmld, Jacob Gruhler. Al C. Gehret,
D. B. Faktor and A. H. Pape have been
doing excellent work and are in line for
the honors. The shooting on the honor
ary target was remarkable. Five rifle
men made 72 out of a possible 75. Un
fortunately for Max Kolander. of San
Francisco, who has been doing some ex
cellent shooting, he finished his ticket on
the wrong target. He made 74 out of a
possible 75. The score could not be al
lowed under the rules*. He continued his
work and stands with 72 to his credit.
The festival wl|l be concluded to-mor
row, when the contestants for king will
complete their scores. Competition will
also be held on the honorary target and
as there are five men who have 72 each
out of a possible 75, a warm time Is ex
pected to decide supremacy. The follow
ing marksmen competed for king:

Charles Teller, who was beaten by Al
len, had an excellent chance by beating
the scratch man, but lost through a mis
take of the referee. Teller had a lead of
4-3 in the final set and Allen was back
"30" when the referee found Teller had
been receiving the wrong handicap. He
decided the last set should be played over.
It went to Allen easily. The set should
have been completed with the proper
handicap Instead of being played over.
Neil Baker playing from scratch Ioom3
up as a possible winner. Final honors
should fall to either MacGavin or one of
the Baker brothers.
MacGavin was the star performer and
played some great tennis. He had a hard
match with J. R. Lewis and won by a
small margin. In his match with Russell
he was at his best and drove splendidly.
The only one of the good players ta loaÂ«
was R. N. Whitney. In his match with
Code he did not exert himself greatly.
Allen and MacGavin are the only scratch
men left.
SeveraL hundred spectators were treat
ed to an exhibition of good tennis yester
day on the public courts in Golden Gata
Park. The majority of the matches were
close and interesting. Ten of the 104 play

WEDGEWOOD A WINNER
AT INGLESIDE PARK
Frank Jones' Wedgewood, a hound that
was once a crackajack, but which retro
graded to a two-course winner, surprised
the wise ones yesterday at Ingleside Park
by taking first honors in the big coursing
stake. Throughout the entire running
Wedgewood put the men with money in
bad humor by his persistent winnings.
â¢Every time Wedgewood left the slips it
was against a heavily played favorite.
He managed to win out by his cleverness.
When it came to the final the heavy bet
torfi became a bit afraid and cut down the
odds until they forced the big white dog
close to even money. It did not take long
to have Wedgewood show hia training and
in quick time he took the flag from Co
sette: A few weeks ago Frank Jones
about had his mind made up to send
Wedgewood to the city pound and he
came in for considerable Joshing when
his hound landed the stake without a bet
placed by his owner. Following are the

Joe Corbett was, as usual, the brightest
light of the show. He got in wrong and
remained so for an inning or more. But
as soon as he steadied his wing and gath
ered his wits the Cripples were entirely
at his mercy. Not one of their number
imprinted his foot on the home plate for
seven innings.
Graham started as well as an erratic
southpaw usually does, and he was more
than himself till the sixth inning hove In
sight. Then the bats of the southern
giants began to swing with a certainty
that always makes base hits possible.
After two runs crossed the plate the
blonde left-hander began to lob the ball
up and quit without an effort.
When the seventh opened, Peter un
folded a new one, also of the left-hand
variety, on the crowd. ' His name Is Hltt,
an inappropriate one for a pitcher, but
nevertheless he was in the game some
and would have done well had he good
command over his curves.
One of the bright spo{s of the ginger
less struggle was the magnificent throw
ing to bases on the part of Father Pete.
The veteran whipped them down to sec
ond so fast and with bo much accuracy
that the fleet-footed Angel base runners
were caught time and time again. Ross
did some pretty fielding out in left and
the work of Corbett In gathering in slow
bunts and covering first base was worth
going miles to see. The score:
Oakland. Los Angeles.

RUNS AND HITS BT INNINGS.
Though a day that makes baseball
worth the watching, the smallest Sunday
crowd of the season watched through
those nine Innings of sand-lot ball/ There
were large holes in the spacious bleachers
and the big grandstand was shy many
hundred admirers of the national pastime
who are wont to hie themselves thither
of a bright Sunday afternoon.
Nor did tho piaylng of the rival teams
warrant a better attendance. Except In
the early stages of the contest, while. the
score remained a tie, it was a wofully
half-hearted affair, lacking that life and
ginger that has made baseball a sport
worth viewing. The Cripples were hope
lessly outclassed. They realized the fact
even better than did those who watched
the game.
said good-by to thjp noisy fans on
the bleachers and the more reserved ele
ment In the stands. But ere they made
their getaway they beat the Cripples 11
to 2. In the morning it was the same
way, only the score happened to be 15 to 9.
THE Angel champions will perform
no more this year at the Eighth
street baseball park. They gath

AMERICANS as well as men of British birth
deplored the death of Sir -Hector Macdonald,
the hero of the British army, under-circum
stances that seemed to leave his name smirched with
dishonor and shame. The sad story will be readily
recalled. Macdonald, a boy of poor parentage, en
tered the British army as a private and fought his way
up to the rank of major general, winhing the Victoria
Cross on the way. He was the idol of the rank and
file of the army and was honored 'by the ablest and
foremost of the officers. He was in England enjoy
ing the honors he had won when a summons came
to him to return to Ceylon to answer charges gravely
affecting his character. He started to Ceylon, but at
Paris committed suicide, and thus seemingly con
fessed himself incapable of clearing his fame of the
charges brought against him.
Even at the time there were men who knew him
well who did not hesitate to maintain his innocence
and to attribute his suicide to a form of insanity that
not. infrequently occurs in vigorous minds of natives
of the temperate zone who have overworked them
selves in the tropics. It now appears that the view
of these faithful friends is correct and that the brave
soldier was not the guilty creature scandal pro
claimed him.
Shortly after the suicide six commissioners were
appointed to inquire into the circumstances attending
and affecting the death of Macdonald. The commis
sion has'now reported, and the Westminster Gazette
in reviewing the findings says: "The report is pub
lished from the Government buildings, Colombo, and
says that the commissioners, individually and collect
ively, declare on oath that, after the most .careful,
minute and exhaustive inquiry and investigation of
the whole of the circumstances and facts connected
with the sudden and unexpected death of the late Sir
Hector Macdonald, they unanimously and unmis
takably find absolutely no reason or cause whatso r
ever which would create feelings such as wouM de
termine suicide in preference to conviction of- any
crime affecting the moral and irreproachable chafac-

The latest volume of Nauticus, a year
book relating to Germany's maritime af
fairs, contains an interesting resume of
the personnel question in the several na
vies, especially dealing with the functions
of military and engineer officers. It con
tends that each branch is so distinct in its
requirements as to make a combination
of the two out of the question. In Ger
many, as in the United States and Eng
land, changes have been made with a view
of improving the organization of the en
gineer officers' corps. The plan went Into
operation in 1900 and its erfect will soon
be ascertained. Young men desirous of
becoming engineer officers must have had

form a satisfactory fixed point. The. line
is laid in coils and not on a roll, and is
fitted with a simple ' electrical Indicator.
An accuracy of 1 per cent is obtained
with this arrangement, whereas the latest

vies do not come nearer than 3 per cent to
the actual velocity and are utterly unre

has therefore been recommended for use

total of 16,000 miles was steamed by each
of the two vessels, the Europa with boil

trip neither showed defects of any kind.
The Spartiate upon her return from
China Joined the fleet In maneuvers and
added 9000 miles to her 16,000 miles, and
when the ship was paid off the btflers

instances indicating: the value of these
boilers Is the Spartiate's steaming record

230 tons of coal, which Is equivalent to
nearly four, miles on one ton of coal ftt

by any other type of boiler.
But it must not be inferred from all this that busi
ness as a rule is stagnant Far from it Many lines
of trade still report an excellent movement with a fair
margin of profit* Many branches of manufacture are
still actively employed, with orders placed ahead.
The railway earnings thus far in October are 6.2 per
cent larger than last year and 12.7 larger than in 1901.
The New England shoe factories are reporting ship
ments heavier than in any previous year. The woolen
trade also reports rather better sales than of late,
though the raw product is quieter. The Eastern
cotton mills have not yet fully resumed and are not
buying heavily at present *Dry goods are reported
dull at many places, but the movement in groceries
and provisions is said to be better, following easier
prices. The wholesale and jobbing buyers, however,
are proceeding cautiously 'and not ordering every
thing in sight as they have heretofore done during
the past four or five years. The~haturar law of sup
ply and demand is now being observed.
Briefly the country is recovering from its recent

fever, while the latter is a most excellent corrective.
We have not been seriously hurt and probably will
not be.
OMMERCIAL reports from most sections of
I the country last week indicated a continued
quieting down in general business and the
fall demand was reported considerably less than for
several years past. The bank clearings tended to con-'
firm these reports, as they showed a falling off of 24,3
per cent from the corresponding week in 1902 with
about half of the largest cities on the wrong side of
the exhibit. The loss at New York was 36.7 per cent,
though much of this was doubtless due to tlje shrink
age of values on the Stock Exchange and the lack of
speculative activity which prevailed during most of the
week. The failures throughout the country were 208,
against 206 last year.
Business is still good in the West, but the farther
cast the reports go the quieter business gets. The
Pacific slope reports the movement fully as good as
at this time last year. Hence it will be seen that a
certain wave of comparative inactivity is proceeding
across the country from east to # west and that it ha?
not yet reached this coast. It is interesting to note
in this connection that there seems to be a universal
and undeviating law that all movements and changes,
religious, social and commercial, move over the
world from east to west, traveling with the sun, and
that this law has operated as far back as the records
of the human race show. The tide of population has
ilmost invariably followed this great law.
It is generally agreed now that the direct cause of
this quieting down in business is the great shrinkage
in speculation and prices in Wall street. It took
months for this shrinkage to affect general business,
ttrt it did at last. Money stringency was not the
cause, for money is reported easy everywhere, there
being less demand for it. Collections arc slower than
they have been, though no serious complaints on this
score are heard. The general tendency in all lines is
toward a lower plane of prices, including farm prod
ucts, merchandise and manufactured goods, though
the downward movement is very gradual and normal
and apparently a natural recession from inflated valua
tions to more moderate prices. When the adjustment
is completed and prices are where they ought to be
we may consider business as once more on a normal.
basis.
There is not, nor has there been, anything sensa
tional about this gradual readjustment. Spasms have
occurred in Wall street, and every now and then some
great trust quietly disintegrates of its own weight;
but the v movement is noiseless, like the silent sliding
away of a snow bank. The great banking interests
have put the brakes on the decline from time to time, .
just as they did on the advance when it became too
feverish. The great bulk of the loss has fallen on the
â¢rich and very little of it on the poor. The slump in
Wall street has been frequently styled "a rich man's
panic" As pointed out in this column some months
ago, it was largely a paper loss and rather a disap
pointment in anticipated profits than an actual money
loss. True, a good deal of actual money has been
sunk in inflated speculation and overexpanded invest
ments, but the paper loss has been much larger than
the real loss in dollars and cents. This is probably
the reason why the shrinkage has thus far not been
accompanied by any pronounced financial stringency.
Of the two evils the country has suffered the least
TRADE STILL QUIETING DOWN.
The general idea entertained is that the greatest
need is the improvement of roads. 'The recommenda
tion is made that the great highway through the
county to the Sonoma line be modernized. From
Sausalito to San Rafael it is in excellent condition and
also a few miles north from the last mentioned city.
"It leads through a picturesque country that is
touched by the railroad at only two points and would
be a source of pleasure to thousands if it were in the
condition that the ideas of to-day demand."
Then again it is proposed that the ro|ji around
Point San Pedro that has been discussed during
twenty years by the people of San Rafael should be
constructed. "It would be the star attraction of San
Rafael and would pay for its cost five or six times in
a year in the business it would bring."
A new road is also suggested to reach the Nicasio
Valley to open up the country between Nicasio and
Point Reyes. "There is no more beautiful country in
the State than that comprised between Nicasio and
Point Reyes townships, but they are pretty much a
closed book to the multitude who travel on wheels of
one sort or another under the existing conditions."
The rough estimate of $150,000 is given as the cost
to^provide the roads in the county "that would sim
ply transform it and leave it without a rival in its
own line around the bay of San Francisco." 'â¢ v
To educate the people to the advantages to be de
rived from good roads to open up all the scenic beau
ties of Marin County the Tocsin would have an im
provement club formed comprised of the leading men
of each section of the county who have leisure 1 and
inclination to give definite attention to the subject.
It says: "Several problems will have to be considered,
among them being the 'passage of a constitutional
amendment permitting the issuance of bonds for such
a purpose, as the bonds of Sacramento County for a
like purpose were once rejected on legal grounds.
But if the work is once placed in strong hands all
obstacles will give way, and now that public interest
seems aroused is the time to make a start."
EDITOR JAMES H. WILKINS of the Marin
County Tocsin is exhorting the people of
Marin County to "prepare a great pleasure
ground for a city that will before long contain 1,000,
000 inhabitants." The county can, he says, "be made
.1 land of homes for those who love nature. and have
the means and leisure to gratify their tastes. To ac
complish this it is only necessary to improve the op
portunities that the Creator has placed before us."
The preliminary step to be taken, so writes the
editor, is to have "a careful and intelligent investiga
tion by men familiar with the topography of the dif
ferent localities, men of taste, experience and broad
gauge minds, who can consider the subject as a whole
and not with any narrow desire to secure some selfish
advantage for themselves." â¢ â¢

PERSONAL MENTION.
A' valuable seam of coal,< available for
naval purposes, has been struck on the
Glencraig Colliery, Fifeshire, about two
miles from the new naval base at St:
Margarets Hope, Scotland. The coal mina
is adiacent to the future anchorage of
warships, making the discovery of inesti
mable value to the navy.
The successful trial of the Belleville
boilers of the British cruiser Spartiate
closes the battle of the boilers. The com
mission which, lifter several years of ex
haustive and expensive trials, .condemned
the Belleville type as unfit for use in ships
of war is coming in for a gooJ deal of
criticism and it Is charged that politics
were at the bottom of the business. The
opposition to the Lord Spencsr adminis
tration was led by William Allen, a Radi
cal of the most pronounced kind. He was
dead set against water-tube boilers cf
any klna and it was deemed good politics
to throw discredit on the party that had
introduced this kind of boiler in_the navy.
Another combination known as the anti-
Bellvilles joined forces with the Allen op
position because the boilers were of
French make, and a stuffed board did
what was required of it. The plan, how
ever, miscarried, for Rear Admiral May,
Controller of the Navy, cared more for
naval efficiency than for politics, and, dis
regarding the boiler committee and its
verdicts, selected two Belleville cruisers,
the Europa and Spartiate, for a cruise to
China and back under war conditions^ A
The British Admiralty has awarded con
tracts for three armored cruisers to the
Fairfleld Company at Glasgow. Armstrong
at Newcastle and Vickers at Barrow. The
ships are to be of the Duke of Edin
burgh type, 480 feet in length, 13,020 tons
displacement, 24.000 horsepower and 22 1-3
knots speed, as compared with the Black
Prince and Duke of Edinburgh, having
480 feet length. 13.550 tons displacement,
23,500 horsepower and 22 knots epeed. The
belt Â« n<1 .side armor is of 6-inch Krupp
steel and the gun protection of heavy and
secondary batteries are of the same thick
ness. The main battery is composed of
six 9.2-inch and ten 6-lnch. Another ship
of the same class Is to be built at one
of the dockyards, making six vessels sim
ilar to the California class, of which six
are being built for the United States
Navy.
. It !s,over four and a half years since
the personnel law went into effect, by
which the Engineer Corps ceased to exist
as a distinct organization In the navy.
The engineers were merged with the line
and of the 184 former engineer officers
in July, 1899, only 141 remain, the rest
having either died, resigned or retired.
Of the present total 23 are exempt from
sea service, leaving only iJ5 available for
service afloat. To make up for the with
drawal of commissioned engineer officers
the grade of warrant machinist was es
tablished, beginning, in 1900, with 100 men
and was recently Increased to 150,and these
warrant officers, \together with enlisted
machinists; have satisfactorily performed
the duties of commissioned engineers on
board ships. Engineer in Chief Melville
was somewhat pessimistic regarding the
ability of warrant machinists and prophe
sied t all sorts of disastrous results, but
fortunately none of them have material
ized; ships come and go as they were
wont to; there have been no serious break
downs and no visible Increase in repair
bills. The torpedo-boats are run by prac
tical engine drivers, and the efficiency of
the navy as a whole does not seem to have
been impaired by substituting experi
enced warrant officers at J1200 a 'year for
the high salaried naval academy grad
uates.
chinery, but it is somewhat dif
ferent when it conies to designing engines
for future ships. The new engineer in
chiefs-Rear Admiral C. W. Rae, chief of
the Bureau of Steam Engineering, has
recommended the appointment of a board
to; report upon the subject of training line
officers in engineering. The board,' com
posed of Captain Converse, Commander
Perry, formerly an engineer, and Lieu
tenant C. Davis, Is to report on the estab
lishment of an engineering school x for
officers, and^m" the period in tneir pro
fessional career in which officers 'should
receive this instruction. It would seem
that the best instruction would be on
board, ships by the warrant machinists.
If the officer is really desirous of knowing
the working of engines and the. proper
way of keeping up steam, he can learn
more in the engine and boiler room in a
ship in commission in three months than
he will know after a year's course at an
engineering, school. As it is now, the
mere presence of a line officer on the
engine-room platform does not raise the
steam one *ound nor add to ,the revolu
tions of the propellers. As for the de
signers of "machinery, there is no scarcity
of such outside of the navy.
THE navy afloat is not seriously in
. need of highly scientific persons
to run and take care of the ma-
AS the municipal campaign progresses it becomes
more and more evident that despite the ap
pearance of three tickets in the field we are
to have in the closing days of the contest, a straight
issue between two parties, with. the third ticket vir
tually out of the fight It is of course natural that it
â¢houjd be so, for in American politics there is no
room for a third party as a permanent factor. In the
practical work of government there must be an ad
ministration party and an opposition party, but for
a third party, which is neither one thing nor the
other, there is no place whatever in practical politics.
In the present contest we have the administration
represented by the Mayor himself, seeking re-election
by an appeal to those discontented elements of the
population which two years ago were powerful enough
to profit by a division of sentiment among conserva
tives and elect him to office. The natural opposition
to such a municipal government is the Republican
party, for that party has ever been the party of pros
perity and contentment, the party whose great policy
of protection to. American industry carries benefits to
capital and labor alike. In municipal as in national
politics that party stands for harmony of sentiment
and unity of effort among all classes of Americans.
It is therefore inevitable that the great masses of the
conservative people of the city should look to it for
leadership in making a fight against the factions that
are seeking to continue in power an administration
founded upon class prejudices and devoted mainly to
the advancement of the personal fortunes of a few
leaders.
From the very opening of the campaign the ten
dency has been toward drawing the line clearly be
tween the party of prosperity headed by Mr. Crocker
and the party of discontent led by Schmitz and Ruef.
It may be that some conservative Democrats do not
see the futility of Lane's candidacy, but there is no
misconception of the subject on the part of the dis
contented elements of the party. Those elements are
not going to throw away their votes by voting for
Lane,. They are going to vote for Schmitz, .and
accordingly the candidacy of the Mayor is formidable.
That is the issue which gives importance to the can
vass, and the fact should be carefully* pondered by
every citizen who desires not only a good government
of the municipality, but the elimination of class preju
dices and dissensions from local politics.
Lane and Schmitz recognize that they are appealing
to the same class of voters, and accordingly each is
doing his best or his worst to discredit the other.
The campaign between them ranges daily from farce
comedy to mud slinging. There has been as yet no
open affray between the personal partisans of the two
leaders, but there have been occasions when red pep
per was strewn in halls where speaking was to occur
and decayed fruit thrown at the heads of spellbinding
orators. Such campaigning is doubtless offensive to
Mr. Lane, but the very fact that he is mixed up in it
shows the quality of the factional spirit that, con
fronts him and to which he must appeal.
While such tactics are being used by the followers
of Lane and of Schmitz the campaign of Mr. Crocker
and of his colleagues on the Republican ticket has
been steadfastly maintained on the high plane of rea
son and personal dignity. That fact in itself is suf
ficient to show the nature of the forces that are back
of the Republican organization in this contest. They
are forces that tend to harmony and good will among
all classes of citizens. Mr. Crocker is not a business
man's candidate any more than he is a workingman's
candidate. He is a genuine Republican asking sup
port of his fellow citizens upon the broad platforms
of Republicanism, which in their essential elements
are virtually the platforms of good citizenship.
Attention has been directed in our local columns
to a phase of the contest that should not be over
looked. Ample experience has shown that with each
successive ballot law many votes are lost by reason
of mistakes in preparing ballots. Such being the
case it will be advisable in this election for every Re
publican to vote a straight ticket so that no excuse
may be given for the judges to throw it out. We
ought moreover to have a good straight Republican
victory this year as a preparation for the coming
Presidential election. This is a contest in which the
Republican party is the only organization in the field
that stands for straight politics. It is. but right
therefore that its loyal members should vote the
straight ticket and make the victory a clean sweep.

curing dandruff; and that is to kill the
germ that causes It and falling hair and
finally baldness. There is only one prep-
aration that will destroy the germ, and
that is Newbro's Herpicide. It is an en-
tirely new discovery and the only hair
preparation that is based on the new sci-
entific principle. In addition Herpicide is
a very refreshing hair dressing for reg-
ular toilet use. Sold by leading drug-

NEWBERG, Or.. Oct. 18.-Mlss MllllÂ©
Hoist, a young woman of this place, aged
23 years, committed suicide on the street
last evening by drinking carbolic acid.
She was noticed walking back and forth
before a dry goods store, seemingly In
great distress. A man accosted her and
asked what the trouble was. She replied:
"I've taken carbolic acid. I'm tired of
life."
She was hurriedly taken to her home
and medical aid summoned, but she died
about an hour later. The cause of her
suicide was the refusal of Samuel Gaunt,
a barber at McMlnnvllle, to come to New
berg to see her. The two have been on
close terms for some time and the girl
was much In love.- Just before taking the
poison she had called Gaunt up over the
long distance telephone and asked him to
come down on Sunday. He refused.
A singular coincidence in the case is
that Gaunt's wife committed suicide In
the same way a year ago.

birds of the young duck season. Between
mouthful? of succulent teal the skipper
related the tale of the pilot boat's unusual
experience on Saturday night whoa cruis

nearly midnight and all was still, save
the dismal swashing of the waves against
the bow of the boat. Suddenly there was
a great whirr of wings and a tremendous
rmash against the main sail, and then,
with a great thud, hundreds of wild ducks
fell to the deck and lay stunned by the
sudden Impact with the vessel. The man
at the helm didn't know what had struck
him and commenced kicking the flutter

helm and succeeded in saving- a fine lot
of big fat birds, not, however, before sev
eral hundred had already been thrown
into the sea. It is the first case of its
kind that has been reported here. The
ducks were evidently making for the port

that it includes some of the biggest men
of the Middle West financial world. The
Rock Island Company made special ar
rangements for the accommodation of the
travelers, who Journeyed westward in a
train of eight Pullmans ajid a buffet car
and a diner, a special that was a duplica
tion, as far as possible, of the train which
is bringing the New Yorkers to San Fran
cisco. Traveling all the way was done at
a high rate of speed, and for the purpose
of anticipating any possible accident the
special waa preceded by a pilot engine.
Stops were made at Denver, Colorado
bprings and Salt Lake City, and at each
place the bankers were the recipients, of
the hospitality of the local bankers The
only accident- to mar the trip westward
occurred' at Reno, where Colonel J D
Powers, through the sudden parting of
two of the cars, was injured by falling
between them. His shoulder was dislo
cated. Arriving in this city, the unfortu
nate gentleman was taken to the Rail
road Hospital for treatment.
The Chicago special was under the
management of John L. Hamilton of
Hoopestown III.; George M. Reynolds of
Chicago and Arthur Reynolds of n e3
Moines. -
The bankers from Chicago and vicinity
who arrived on their special train at the
Oakland mole late Saturday night crossed
to this side of the bay at an early hour
yesterday morning. After securing the
apartments at the Palace that had been
previously engaged for them they took
advantage of the Inviting weather to visit
the ocean beach and other points. By 2
o'clock in the afternoon there was barely
a corporal's guard of the Eastern finan
ciers to be found around the hotel, and
their absence wa3 marked until a late
hour in the evening, so busy had they
been enjoying their first day's recreation
in this city after a long overland ride.
BIO MEN IN THE PAB.TT.
The arrangements of the local commit
tee of bankers for the reception and en
tertainment of their business colleagues
from points beyond the lines of the State,
who are to meet in annual convention
here this week, were completed to the
minutest detail yesterday. To-day \the
bulk of the west-bound delegations will
have arrived and the attention of the
committee here will be at once turned
to affording the guests every possible fa
cility for enjoying themselves prior to
the opening of the regular programme of
the convention week.
PORTLAND, Or., Oct. , 18.â The spec
tacle of smoke rising from many spots in
the surface of a vacant lot covered with
grasB caused W. Bagby, recently arrived
from Salt Lake City, to telephone the
Fire Department this afternoon. The
Fire Department thought Bagby was a
harmless lunatic and paid no attention to
his message. .
Meanwhile a multitude of spectators
gathered at the spot and the tenants of
neighboring houses became alarmed, an
ticipating some kind of a subterranean
upheaval. The reported eruption of Mount
St. Helens and the recent earthquake felt
here formed a basis for their fear and
the Police Department was inundated
with inquiries.
Investigation developed the fact that in
past . years the lot had been used as a
woodyard and later had been filled in.
In some way the wood and - sawdust un
derlying the ground became ignited and
the smoldering fire ate its way in many
directions beneath the surface. For fear
that the fire would communicate to build
ings in the vicinity the Fire Department
flooded the lot with water.

~71iiii inWr-i'iniiU'i niiir*- -PEKING, Oct. 18.â The recent episode at
the British Legation in Peking, which
has been described as as an attempt to
blow up the legation magazine during a
military ball, was in reality the robbery
of certain ordnance stores, supposedly b'y
Chinese servants, who carried the gun
fittings and other portable articles away
with them, but left the detonating appar
atus outside the magazine, apparently
finding difficulty in carrying It AH the
stolen property has been recovered from
the junk chops, where it was sold by the
thieves.

KESWICK. Oct. 18.â The two immense
sawmills at McCloud have closed for tho
season a month earlier than usual, owing
to the scarcity of cars to ship the prod
uct. The last mill closed last night. Men
are leaving camp by hundreds to find
work for the winter, although all who
care to remain will be given work extend
ing the logging railroads farther into the
woods. Plans call for twelve more miles
of railroad spurs and a fourteen-stall
roundhouse.

NAPA, Oct 18.â Robert Black, a horse
trader' who formerly conducted a stable
in Napa, was arrested at St. Helena yes
terday by Constable Spurr on a charge of
child stealing. The complaint was made
by Mrs. Sarah J. Yeamans, who charges
that Black enticed her daughter, Dottle
Higglns, away on October 12. The girl is
only 14 years of age and was employed
for a time at the Napa Hotel as a wait
ress. .
Black was arraigned before Justice
Palmer last night and bail was fixed at
$25,000. The case was continued till
Wednesday morning.
Horse Trader Arrested on the Com
plaint of a Resident of
Napa.
MOTHER MAKES CHARGE
. THAT CHILD WAS STOLEN
The matter has dragged over the court
calendars for a number of months, and
now the filing of a dismissal of the suit
has furnished additional food for gossip
mongers. It Is alleged. that the suit was
compromised, owing to the fact that the
records of the marriage in Missouri were
destroyed in a fire there some years ago,
which consumed the courthouse and rec
ords. It is rumored that the woman who
laid claim to being the widow of deceased
secured a large share of the property left
by Irwin.
SANTA ROSA, Oot. 18.â The suit brought
by Mrs. Rebecca Irwin against Joseph Ir
win, administrator of the estate of New
ton C. Irwin, to prevent the distribution
of the estate, has-been compromised and
the people of Sonoma County have been
deprived of the sensational phases of the
case which promised to develop. The mat
ter caused a decided sensation here when
the action was first filed.
Newton C. Irwin, a pioneer and well
known citizen of Sonoma County, died
about a year ago, leaving a family of
grown children. He was a highly respected
citizen, who had married in this State and
no taint of scandal had ever besmirched
his name. When the estate was in readi
ness for distribution Mrs. Rebecca Irwin
of Missouri, claiming to be the rightful
widow of Irwin, filed a contest for a wid
ow's share of the property.
Irwin left a widow in this State, who
was greatly surprised at the claims of
the Eastern woman. The latter claimed
that fifty years ago Mr. Irwin, deceased,
had deserted her to come to California,
and that subsequent to that time she had
never heard from him. :

Meehan found In the clothing of the
dead man a loaded revolver, a watch and
chain and $14 S5 in cash. There was also
a letter from Cloquet, Minn., signed
"Your sister, Amelia," and dated Aug
ust 13. In It she spoke of "Johnnie doing
so well in the saloon business here" and
being glad that he liked it. She also ex
pressed her regret that his eyes were not
any better. The letter was addressed to
307 Fourth street.
Inquiry at 307 Fourth street elicited the
Information that La Fleur ' engaged a
room there In March last and remained
till last month. All that was known
about him was that he said he came from
Alaska and was troubled with sore eyes.
At 471 Fourth street it was said that La
Fleur had lived there for about a month,
but nothing was known about him.
Emma "Woods, the woman mentioned In
the letter, called'at the Morgue last night
and identified the remains. She is a come
ly colored woman and stated that she
had received a telegram from La Fleur In
Seattle requesting her to come to this
city and arrive here on October 17. She
started at once, but was unable to reach
here until this evening, ana upon her ar
rival repaired to the Fourth-street ad
dress, where she was Informed that La
Fleur had committed suicide. The woman
says she was with the dead man in Nome
during 1902 and had not seen him since his
departure from there in the same year.
She Is unable to assign any reason for the
suicide.
The Morgue was notified and Deputy
Coroner Meehan removed* the body. He
found the following note written in pencil
on a table In the room:
I am sorry that I have to do this, but I will
not leave myself to the mercy of anybody,
dead or alive. I have a room at 471 Fourth
street â room 15. My name is John La Fleur.
I don't owe anybody a cent. Emma Woods will
take care of me. She will be here to-day, Oc
tober 18, 1003. All there is in my room be
longs to her; my bank account also, that is
$500 and $15 on my person.
JOHN LA FLEUR.
John La Fleur engaged a room at the
lodging-house, 781 Folsom street, on Sat
urday night for 60 cents. Yesterday about
noon the landlady detected the odor of
gas coming from La Fleur's room. She
tried to open the door, but found It
locked from the inside. She notified Po
liceman Tyrrell, who forced open the door
and discovered La Fleur lying on the bed
fully dressed. He had attached a piece
of tube to the gas fixture, turned on the
gas and placed the other end In bis
mouth. He had been dead for some
hours.

WEST SIDE LUMBER COMPANY.
A Democratic evening newspaper dis
putes the well-known fact that Henry J.
Crocker Is a successful business man and
seeks to convey the impression that the
West Side Lumber Company was a fail
ure under Mr. Crocker's management.
The "West Side Lumber Comoany was
incorporated in 1898. The three owners
were William H. Crocker. Henry J.
Crocker and T. S. Bullock. Henry J.
Crocker was president and manager and
constructed the plant and also the Hetch
Hetchy and Yosemite Valley Railroad, of
which he is president. After placing the
plant, on an earning basis Henry J.
Crocker resigned from the management.
T. S. Bullock sold out his interest and a
month ago Henry J. Crocker and his
present associates bought out William H.
Crocker's interest, paying him back all
the money he had placed in the property
and more than $1,000,000 additional profits.
Henry J. Crocker Is therefore the sole re
maining shareholder of the original in
vestors and incorporators. Thd plant is
conceded to be the finest In the State and
stands as a monument to the enterprise,
skill and business ability of Henry J.
Crocker. The Eastern owners aro men of
marked success In the lumber Industry.

nated:
MEETINGS FOR WEEK.
Henry J. Crocker is making a creditable
and winning campaign. Business men
earnestly favor his election because his
success at the polls on November 3 will
tend to the advancement of San Fran
cisco. Representative workingmen are
lending their support to Mr. Crocker be
cause they regard him as a fair minded,
able and enterprising citizen. Assurance
comes from every Assembly district of
the city that the Republicans are united
and active. Prospects for the success of
the whole Republican ticket from top to
bottom are remarkably bright. It is now
estimated by conservative forecasters
that Henry J. Crocker's vote for Mayor
will approximate 24,000. Enthusiastic Re
publicans speak of 30,000 votes for the
ticket. A prediction was made last night
by one who has given the subject special
study. It is assumed that the total vote
will be 58,500 and that candidates for
Mayor will get the following:
Henry J. Crocker 24,000
B. E. Schmltz 19.000
Franklin K. Lane 14 000
Frank R. Whitney (Socialist) 1,500

Eleven years ago Howland was ar
rested on Ashbury street by two de
tectives and charged with a serious of
fense. He was tried, convicted and sen
tenced. After he had served his time
he disappeared and was not seen again
until about a year ago, when he went to
work as a teamster. He has been re
cently employed by the Almshouse.
Three weeks ago Seville, on behalf of
his daughter, who resides with him at
the pumping station in the park, pre
ferred another charge against Howland.
The latter was arrested and released on
bonds. He did not appear In court and
was later taken Into custody on a bench
warrant. A portion of the case was heard
last Saturday and the matter postponed
until Monday. Various witnesses for the
prosecution gave their testimony In the
Police 'Court and the statements of Se
ville and his daughter were most dam
aging to the defendant.
Yesterday afternoon Howland was seen
loitering in the' vicinity of the water
works with the rifle in his hands. Seville
did not notice him at first and walked
from his : house. As the park employe
did so he claims that the accused man
raised the rifle, and, fearing for his life,
Seville rushed back to the house. The
police were notified as soon as possible
and Thomson and Budd . came on horse
back to the scene. They found Howland
concealed In the brush near the place
and put him under arrest. He claimed
he carried the weapon for the purpose of
going hunting in the park, and was
booked for the violation of a park ordi
nance and a more serious charge may
be made against him to-day.
"William "W. Howland, a teamster for
the Almshouse, who has on different
occasions been arrested on serious
charges, was yesterday taken into cus
tody bv Park Policemen S. M. Thomson
and C. G. Budd and jlocked up at the
Park Police Station. At the time of his
arrest Howland carried a Krag-Jorgensen
rifle and, the police allege, was about to
assassinate H. D. Seville, superintendant
of the park water works.
Mrs. Birmingham and Miss Genevieve
Morony announce a musical and dramatic
matinee for Friday/October 23, at the Al
cazar .Theater, assisted in the musical
portions of the programme by Wenzel
Kopte, the Bohemian violinist, arid Theo
dore Mansfeldt, cellist. The dramatic por
tion of the entertainment brings forward
no less a favorite than Miss Florence
Roberts, who, with the assistance of all
the artists mentioned, will recite Murger's
poem, "La Ballade du Desespere," ar
ranged with special dramatic music by
Bemberg. The poem forms a tragic play
let, In which Miss Roberts alone on the
stage replies with dramatic action and
declamation to a mysterious contralto
voice outside. Mrs. Birmingham sings the
contralto role. The playlet has been given
In Europe by Sarah Bernhardt and Mme.
Melba, but this; is its first public: per
formance in this country. '
"The Christian" drew two Immense au
diences to the Grand Opera House yester
day The presentation of Hall Caine's
powerful play was admirable In every re
spect and at '.both performances was re
ceived with Â«reat tavor. Mr. Baker has
selected a thoroughly well-balanced com
pany and every character, from the lead
ing role down to the smallest part in the
church- scene, is well enacted.
The star of the cast Is Cathrlne Coun
tiss who, as Gloria Quayle, gives a
charming and delightful Impersonation of
that exacting and difficult role. She is an
exceedingly attractive young woman, of
graceful form and carriage and possessed
of a sweet, well-modulated voice, which
is under perfect control. She was spark
ling and bright in the early portions of
the play and in 'the heavy dramatic
scenes she met every requirement. Few
actresses have equaled her here In the
impersonation of this character.
Asa See Willard played John Storm In
a straightforward, convincing manner and
with great sincerity. He had the addi
tional advantage of looking the young
clergyman to the letter.
Etheleyne Palmer played Polly Love
with great tenderness and proved herself
an emotional actress of no mean ability.
Arthur Lane, who made himself a great
favorite at Fischer's in his specialty acts
some time ago, /has now blossomed out
into a full-fledged character actor. He
played two roles, Parson Quale In the pro
logue and the manager in the main play.
His humor is Infectious and he got a
laugh at every turn-
Nicholas Cogley was a dignified Arch
deacon Wealthy and C. E. Inslee played
Horatio Drake for what there was In It.
The scenery and settings were unusu
ally elaborate and the costumes very
handsome. The piece is on' for the week.
On Thursday night the members of the
American Bankers' Association will at
tend in a body.
â¢ ?.;':â¢ ' "' ' â¢
The holdovers, Including A. P. Rostow,
equilibrist: the three Crane Brothers, in
their rural minstrel act, and the Golden
Gate Quartet fill up the bill. Those who
left their seats before the close of the
show at cither of yesterday's perform
ances missed the best biograph picture
ever shown in this city. It is thrown
from the new machine recently purchased
by the Orpheum management and Is of
the police following and capturing an es
caping burglar
Herbert Lloyd, "the King's Jester,"
whose introduction as "Jack of all trades,
but master ! of none," belles him, com
mences his first week. Assisted by Lil
lian Lilyan, he Is a show in himself and
his act is one continuous round of merri
ment. HlÂ«t novelties are wonderful. * He
crowds more raw material and comical
stunts into one act than have ever been
witnessed before. He appears on the
stage in an automobile, with dlamcnd
studded whiskers, and from that time un
til he discards the last of about one hun
hundred ehirt bosoms he calls for ac
cord. Whistling Tom Browne, who made
a reputation in Hoyt's "a Trip to China
town." appears in a fine act. Ho is a
kingpin in his business and has sweet
music on his lips. He intermingles com
edy that Roes very well.
"VVaterbury Brothers and Tenny, in a
comedy sketch, "A Cold Day in July." are
first-class musicians and play upon a va
riety of Instruments. They are funny
whatevei they do and greatly amuse. The
Sisters Rappo are pronounced tho great
est of Russia's dancers.' From their clever
work last night they sustain their repu
tation. The noted Italian change artist,
Colomblno. starts his second week with
new work and is heartily received. A
Parisian comedy In one act opens his
turn, after which he gives caricatures of
great musicians and closes with a carica
ture of a "star" of the Folles Bergere in
Paris. Wallace Brownlow, the English
barytone, appears in new songs and ren
ders them well.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The bill which opened at the Orpheum
yesterday Is worthy of large patronage.
There is nothing on the programme, from
top to bottom, that does not bring most
hearty applause, and several of the new
performers Introduce novelties that have
never been seen in this city before. The
vocalists are of the highest order and the
same may be said of the comedians and
people in specialties. Interest in the show
is held from start to finish and it bears
the stamp of excellence.
From the pickanlnnie who danced the
bedraggled hen between his knees up to
the trim little leading lady in the Jockey's
suit, old Kentucky was all there. The
buck and wing flip flaps, the tidy-looking
horses and the pretty girls, even the mint
juleps â and the mint part was real at
leastâ all combined to make the -produc
tion the theater attraction of the week.
In Miss Bessie Barriscale the manage
ment of "In Old Kentucky" has found
an admirable little actress for the part of
Madge Brierly, the rose of the Cumber
land. She plays the half girl, half woman
admirably, her face and diminutive
figure lending charm to the part. James
Nunn as Colonel Doollttle and George
Deyo. cast as the moonshiner, carry off
the honors in the male parts.
"Ring up de wagon!"â that's how the
realism of. "In Old Kentucky" strikes
Baldy Timmy from Natoma street. Baldy
and his friend Swatsy and all "de utider
guys from, sout' d' slot" were at tho
California last night. They yelled with
the Woodlawn Wangdoodles, they climbed
their stato and stamped when the horse
race csxhfi on and they threw goat calls
at the villain with the Pfeffer whiskers.
Those in the chairs below also showed
that the smashing melodrama can take
the taste out of a mouth satiated with
problem plays and society comedies They
clapped their cloved hands with the gal
lery kids' grimy fist and applauded the
show from first to last.
"Ring up de Â¦wagon!" From the gloom
of the gallery came the plerclns Â£ry.
In the midst of Kentucky's mountains the
herolo young man from the bluegrass
dam below lay dying. The bridge behind
him -was cut In twain-. The fair heroine
could not jump across the canvas chasm
which separated her from her lover. A
dynamite bomb lay sputtering near the
dying ycung man's trouser's leg.
