One hopeful sign at this place Is that
the water has fallen several inches since
morning. All day thousands of persons
have lined the falls cliffs watching the
flood, and the police have had great dif
ficulty in keeping the crowd from en
croaching on the danger line. All day
long boatmen have been at work rescu
ing residents from the flooded districts.
The damage to mill property Is chiefly
from the submersion of portions of the
plants and great quantities of products.
Thousands of men. women and children
will be out of employment for' a long time

flood will cause to the city of Patersoa a,

by Peter Kotz, Into whose house Brown"
had forced an entrance. Brown was 6hot

Brown's act in breaking Into Kotz's

ground of insanity. Brown was acting
etrangely In the early part of the evening,
and is said to have been drinking quite

he was shot. The supposition is that in

MISTAKEN FOR A BURGLAR
President E. G. Foreman f the Fore
man Brothers Banking Company and
Julius Strauss, a brother-in-law of Kohn,
denied all knowledge of the existence of
a Mrs. Kohn and intimated that her claim
was a blackmailing scheme on the part
of the designing woman.
At 2240 Calumet avenue, Kohn's home,
his sisters, Mrs. Foreman and Mrs.
Strauss, hysterically repudiated the al
leged marriage at Beulah, Wis., and de
clared likewise that blackmailing was the
foundation for the woman's presence at
their brother's death in San Francisco.
For a time little was heard of the wo
man. She dwelt with her mother on
Groveland avenue and later lived In a fiat
in the Twenty-second street district.
It was here that she was often seen in
company with young Kobn. The young
man traveled about the "red light" dis
trict on Twenty-second street and keep
ers of resorts say- he spent money with
the prodigality of a prince. A company of
wealthy young men of the South Side
were his associates and Kohn bore the
reputation among those who knew him. of
being a "good fellow." The Webb woman
was known in the Twenty-second street
district as "Dot" Thurman and her past
history was not a secret.
Early this summer the woman went
with Kohn to Lake Beulah, where he had
a summer cottage. It is said that the
couple were married by a Justice of tfie
Peace in the Wisconsin village. When
they returned to Chicago a short time
ago It is said Kohn announced to ac
quaintances that he was going to Europe
with the woman. Instead of doing so it
transpired that he went to California.

STOBY OF A MARRIAGE.
In September, 1900. William B. Dunton,
an absconding employe of the Union Na
tional Bank, was brought back to Chicago
after a wild trip with "Dot" Thurman on
a yacht fn Atlantic waters "and confessed
to having stolen $20,000 from tha .Institu
tion which employed him. It was through
the power of the siren that he was Influ
enced to commit the crime and to blight
the life of his devoted wife.
George S. Forbes, whom Dunton had in
duced to become his accomplice, ended his
life by suicide when the crime was dis
covered. His death was indirectly the re
sult of the far-reaching influence of the
beautiful and daring adventuress. Forbes
was teller in the bank. Dunton would
draw personal checks, which Forbe3
would honor. Then Dunton would steal
the checks and the books would be tam
pered with. *

It is- impossible to learn the truth re

Indians have been placed under arrest,
and the greatest of excitement prevails

The cause of the quarrel which was fol

unusually large amount of liquor. In
some manner, it is said, Kesupkst incur

and after he left the scene of the carousal
they continued to drink, and finally de

The Kesupkst family occupied a- large

The officials were recently startled to
discover that the. treasure in the war
chest had dwindled to $150,000,000. It was
understood that all sums withdrawn from
the chest were restored from loans and
other revenues and the discovery that
this has not been done has created con
sternation here.
A decade ago the Russian state.ac
counts reported that the chest contained
the astonishing Bum of $400,000,000, a llg
ure which the Czar's Minister's and army
chiefs agreed was absolutely necessary to
have In hand in- the event of war. It Is
known that the chest was allowed to be
heavily "tapped" for various purposes in
the Far East, by the Siberian Railroad
among them, while payments to the Chi
nese mandarins and others for secret ser
vice purposes also were made from the
chest.
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. U.-The Czar
has appointed a commission to investigate
the disappearance of a large share of the
hues treasure that was contained In the
so-called Russian "war chest." Russia
has always been supposed to have an
enormous store of gold ready for any war
emergency and a sensation has been
caused here by the discovery that fully
one-half of the treasure has disappeared.

just what has become of the treasure.

by the wreckage from the other bridges
coming down the river. The Calhoun
street bridge was so badly damaged that
to-day no traffic across it was allowed.
Many washouts are reported from differ
ent points, and In some places the tracks
are submerged by the overflowing of the
river.
TRENTON. N. J., Oct. 11.â The extent
of the damage done by the flood in this
section is now beginning to be fully
realized. At least six and possibly all
nine of the wagon and foot bridges across
the Delaware River between this city and
Easton, Pa., have been carried away.
. The one iron bridge between Trenton
and Easton is that crossing the river from
Point . Pleasant, Pa., to Byram, N. J.
This bridge, which is about half way be
tween Trenton and Easton, is believed to
be the only one not destroyed. These
bridges were erected at an average cost of
$50,000 each.
MANY BRIDGES GO OUT.
Enormous Damage Is Done in the
. Vicinity of Trenton.
The Pennsylvania and Lehigh Valley
railroads, except for minor interruptions,
practically resumed their regular sched
ules to-day. All Western mails arrived
here practically on schedule time.
The roads most affected by the storm,
the Erie and Lackawanna, were still
badly tied up on their main lines. On
their various branches It will take days
to repair the damage.
The damage to the Erie was the most
widespread. On its main line to-day
trains got as far as Passaic. On several
of the branches there was little or no
traffic. On the New Jersey and New
York division there were serious and fre
quent interruptions past Spring Valley.
The Lackawanna put up notices which
read: "All, tickets to Washington and
West .sold at passenger's risk."
During the day the mala line was cut
off service between Paterson and Boon
ton. Traffic ceased also on the Sussex
branch, the line being washed out In sev
eral places.
NEW YORK, Oct. 11.â With their re
pair crews working to their limit - and
their depots crowded by stormbound
passengers, the railroads running out of
the city to the New Jersey suburban
districts and tho west and south strug
gled slowly all day to get back to normal
conditions. i

Passaic is a greater sufferer from the
flood than eve/i Paterson. Twenty mills
in Passaic alone are under water and 8000
workers are .out of employment. Ten
thousand persons have left their homes.
Eight hundred houses are flooded to the
eaves and in all 1000 acres are covered
by water from a depth of a few inches to
twenty feet. Several million feet of lum
ber have been carried down to Newark
Bay.
In Weaselbrook the Erie tracks are sus
pended in the air, the twenty-foot em
bankment having been washed away.
Twenty three-story frame houses have
gone -floating down the Passaic River and
as far as can be estimated the loss of
city property, real estate and buildings
is $2,000,000.
The maximum height of the flood was
two feet above the flood of 1902. To-night
it is receding.
Twenty-five bridges are down in Pas
saic and Sussex counties, on the Su'sque
hanna Railroad. Street Commissioner
Breet fears that many houses on River,
Main and West streets will fall.
Seven men are now in peril of their
lives in the Kearns Bros.' dye house on
the river margin near Paterson. A part
of the works has' been carried away. The
men have been In that part which re

they were trying to save thousands of
dollars' worth of silks by carrying them,
to the top of the building the structure;
was surrounded by water and the men
were cut off from all assistance because
of the torrent that has been rushing by
ever since. It is believed that tha entire
building will be carried from its founda
tion unless the flood subsides very soon.
The suffering in Wellington and Dut
tonvllle has been very great, as no re
lief has been able to reach these places.
All through this district houses and out

The city of Passaic passed a sleepless
night, it being feared that the Dundee
dam would give way. That would have
relieved the river at Paterson at the ex
pense of the cities below. Fortunately
Dundee dam is still intact.
water power supply, which is an artificial
stream running through the city parallel
with and about three blocks back from
the city, also overflowed and did consid
erable damage. This has made a, sort of
an island of the intervening high ground.
Comparatively small damage is being
done outside of that to furniture and the
inconvenience caused. Where the houses
are flooded there seems to be no current
and the structures are not being weak
ened on their foundations. Some of the
houses have been abandoned.
The passenger, steamship reported In a

SPOKANE. Wash.. Oct. 11.â ETmer Pe
trie of Sookane was shot to .leath by a
thug on a Northern Pacific freight train
a short distance west of the high Hans
man Creek trestle shortly after 3 o'clock;
to-night. Robbery was the motive of the
murder. G. E. Fu>Kerson, a harvester,
who lives at North Yaklma, was the only
eye witness cf the murder except the ac
complice of the man who fired the shot.
Fulkerson and the victim of th? murder
were traveling together In a lumber cap
from the harvest fields to Spokane, ac
cording to Fulkerson's story, when tho
two men came over the top of the train
and approached them. The four talked
a minute, and then one of the strangers
fired a shot over Fulkerson's h^ l ad. Pe
trle fell over against the lumber pile. Tha
two men then ordered FulkerÂ«on to hold
up 'his hands, searched him and made him
get off the swiftly moving train. Fulker
son landed safely, walked to Spokane and.
told the police his story. The train had
arrived, and In the lumber. Just whera
Fulkerson said the body would be found.
It wai found. The man was dead.
"I had been working as a harvest hand
in the southern part of the county." said
Fulkeraon. "and yesterday I wanted to
come to Spokane. I took a freight train
on the Ssokane and Palouse ac Plaza,
and rode in the caboose. At SD<insIe Pe
trie cot on. The car we were In was %
coal car loaded with lumber. We sat down
between the lumber pile and the end oC
the car. Pretty soon two men came from
toward th* back of the car and sat down
on the edge of the lumber pile on the car
right behind our car. They were sitting
where they cou!d look down on us. Sud
denly one of the men reached a gun right
over my head and fired at Petrle, who
was sitting behind met The shot blinded
me for a moment, and then one of tha
men grabbed me. while the othtr went
through my pockets and took my purse.
"When they told me to Jump off tha
train it was going pretty fast, and I
hated to jump. They told me to be quick
about it. and I Jumped off. As I got off
I heard one of them say: 'I guess we have
shot the other .' That was
the last I saw of thÂ«m. I could not de
scribe the men. Neither of them waa
masked. My Impression is that they
were hoboes. They were roughly dress
ed and wore dark clothes, as near as I
could make out."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The arrest was made . shortly before
noon by Constable Neilson, assisted by
three citizens from the little village of
Halliday. Haworth's presence in the lo
cality was first discovered by the 16-year
old son of Constable Xeilson, who was
returning from Sunday-school. He imme
diately notified his father, who selected
three reliable men, armed them with
shotguns and drove to pie cabin, expect
ing Haworth to give battle. The latter,
however, quietly submitted to arrest. He
was taken back to the penitentiary,
locked in a murderer's cell and a double
guard placed over. him. .
James Lynch, the .other . condemned
prisoner who escaped. Is still at large, but
the prison officials look for his early
capture. In company with a man sup
posed to be an ex-convlct Lynch held up
Ed O'Connell. the night watchman at the
Parley Canyon reservoir, last night and
compelled him ! to drive them several
miles up Emigration Canyon. Since then
no trace has been found of either man.
although many possea. spurred on by the
offer of a large reward, kept up an inces
sant hunt thoughout the day.
SALT LAKE, Oct. 11.â Almost famished,

Special Disp&tch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. VLâ Colonel Richard

and Forty-second street by ~a delivery
wagon.. \-.-i '.Â¦'.';'>. 'vv;^ 1 :.^':^
Born In Utica, N. Y., in 1847, Richard
Henry Savage was destined to see many
lands and many phases of human life. He
was sent in 1S64 to me United States Mli
itary Academy, from which four years
later he was graduated. After serving a
few years as lieutenant in the army he re
tired to civil life until 1871, when he joined
the Egyptian forces, where he remained
for three years. Returning-, to this- co'un
try he entered the employ of the South
ern Railway, and remained with that cor
poration for ten years.
He was married to Miss Anna Josephine
Sheible, - a talented Russian . woman, In
1874, and It was through her Influence that
he turned his attention to literature! His
varied experiences furnished abundant
material. His most successful books were
"My^Offlcial Wife," | which has been dra
matized, and "Under the- Shadow of the
Pyramids." His contributions to * fiction*
have been numerous.
Colonel . Savage -volunteered- for service
in the Spanish-American war and was

of Havana. ' . . '
Ocean City Practically Deserted.
.OCEAN CITY, .Md., Oct. ll.-Thls city
is ' practically deserted to-night. Owing
to the hurricane and high tides the great
er part of the city has been submerged
since Thursday night and many of the
residents have sought shelter on higher
ground. In addition to the damage re
ported in : last night's dispatcher, another
section of the front of : Congress Hall, a
leading hotel, about 100 feet in extent was
torn away to-day. The entire ocean front
of, the Windsor Hotel collapsed. A large
number of cottages , were I either washed
from their foundations or destroyed. {

MISS HENNEY'S DEATH.
Beals was born in Lafayette, Ind., and
was 31 years of age. About four years
ago he was employed at the Home for the
Adult Blind in Oakland and shortly after
leaving this place he. commenced making
balloon ascensions, being employed at dif
ferent places of amusement throughout
the State. His wife and mother have al
ways been opposed to his risking his life
as an aeronaut, and, although he often
promised them that he would abandon the
dangerous profession, like many others he
went up once too often.
He was hurt Sunday, September 27, while
making an ascension at "Coney Island."
but at that time his injuries were not seri
ous. When he went home to dinner yes
terday he told his wife that he was going
to the city, but did not tell her that he
was about to . make an ascension. She
knew nothing of his death until after 9
o'clock last evening.
Beals was well known In Oakland, where
he lived for sixteen years. He was a fire
man In the employ of. the Southern Pa
cific Company and lived at 812 Wood
street with his wife and 6-year-old daugh
ter.
His mother, Mrs. M. J. Beals, lives at
S02 Wood street, where she keeps a rail

in the buggy, drove in all haste to the
hospital. Dr. Stevens-after a short exam
ination said that life had been extinct for
some minutes. Just what caused Beals
to drop Is a matter of conjecture. It is
believed by Vosmer that he feared falling
In the lake he was so fast approaching
and sought to alight In the shrubbery
along the road. He may have misjudged
his distance and thought the fall would
be much less than it was. He struck with
terrible force, sufficient to indent the
earth to a depth ot'*everal inches. It Is
also possible that he wa.=s overcome from
his exertions while performing on the
bar and dropped from lack of strength.

BURLINGTON, N. J., Oct. 11.â This
town is suffering from the worst flood in
its history, approximately; four-fifths of
the place being under water caused by
the tremendous Â» flood in the Delaware
River. The highest point of the town is
only three feet above the flood In some
of the streets, and. the river is still rising.
The southern section of the town is flood
ed to a depth of from two to six feet, and
much of the surrounding country Is also
under water. In East Burlington It is es
timated that 90 per cent of the houses are
Inundated. Many ' families are In want,
and this afternoon the Mayor and,. the
Chief of Police. made a tour of some. of
the streets in a- bateau and gave food to

PHILADELPHIA. Oct. 11.â Delaware
avenue, which runs along the, Delaware
River, was again flooded for a distance of
two miles in this city at high tide this
afternoon. The water was so high that
ferry-boats were unable to enter their
slips without doing damage and for sev
eral hours service between this city and
Camdcn and Gloucester was suspended.
The cellars of most of the business houses
on Delaware avenue were flooded and
thousands of dollars' worth of goods were
either ruined or damaged. The water in
the avenue receded with the tide, but it
Is feared that the next high tide will send
the water up into the thoroughfare again,
as the river is still far above normal.

President Castro's idea being, if not
actually to help the revolutionists with
men and arms, at least to prevent the

NEW ORLEANS, Oct. 11.â Just after a
big six-wheel driver engine that pulled
the Chicago' limited into the Union sta
tion over the Illinois Central had been
cut loose Oscar Nunez Estoplnal, a
nephew of Lieutenant Governor Estoplnal,
Jumped Into the cab and pulled the throt
tle, and the monster engine started down
the network of tracks. It steamed otit
through the government yards, with en
gineers, firemen and yardmen chasing it
at full speed, but they were left far be
hind. Suddenly the wheels struck a turned
switch, that threw the machine on a turn,
table and derailed the tender.
Estopinai escaped, but he was soon cap
tured and locked up. He is said to be
mentally unbalanced. He has a craze for
engines.

"W. A. Bradford of 1185 Market street is
perhaps the most accurate witness to the
tragedy. Bradford was driving with his
wife along, the road that encircles the
chain of lakes in the park when he saw
the aeronaut descending but a few feet in
front of him and within thirty feet of.
one of the lakes. Bradford drew up his
horse, and as he did so Beals. .who was
within forty feet of the ground, suddenly
released his, hold of the trapeze bar and
plunged to the roadway in front of the
horse. Tossing the lines to his: wife the
driver ran to the assistance * of the ' In
jured man, but realized that human help
was of no avail. The balloonist, his skull
fractured and his ' bones shattered, was
breathing his last.
Bradford, however, asked bis wife to
Beals, who was a fireman employed by
the Southern Pacific Company, was en
gaged by Charles W. Vosmer, manager
of the Coney Island Gardens, to make a
series of ascensions. He has been in the
business for about four years and has, at
different times, been under Vosmer's
management. He was considered expert
and reliable and was advertised as a star
feature of the new attraction at the
beach. When the vaudeville programme
had been rendered all was made ready for
the ascension. The massive balloon was
cut loose from its moorings and the aero
naut was carried toward the sky.
The ascension was one of the prettiest
ever seen in the city. There was scarce
ly any wind and tne balloon rose straight
upward to a distance of probably 1500
feet. There was some fear for a time
on the part of the crowd that witnessed
the ascension that the' bag would drift
over the sea and that the aeronaut would
be drowned. All fears were allayed,
however, when the parachute, cut loose,
floated Inland, though the balloon after
the gas had escaped fell on the beach,
within a few feet of the ocean.
Beals amused the throng of spectators
with all sorts of antics. He went up
clinging to the trapeze by his toes, and
when far above the e'arth could be seen
twisting about in gymnastics and ap
peared much at east at the dangerous
height. When he cut his parachute loose
and started back in the direction of terra
tirma he continued his tricks, and when
he was lost to view behind tho trees r.eo
ple expressed themselves as delighted at
what they thought was a successful as
cension. It was not until some time later
that the news of the accident reached the
pleasure grounds. The first intimation
that Vosmer had that all had not gone'
â¢well was when news came from the Park
Hospital that the body of his employe
had been taken there in a buggy. :
AERONAUT STRIKES GROUND.
BEALS CARRIED Â¦ UPWARD.
- f"^ EATH sped in the wake of a bal-
loon that cast its moorings at
JJ Coney Island Gardens yesterday
< afternoon. The aeronaut, Wll
. ' Ham H. Beals, who accompanied
the- inflated canvas bag to dizzy heights,
was dashed to the ground, mangled and
gasping his last, and a young woman,
Miss Madge Henney, who was watching
Its flight' against the sky, was thrown
from an electric car and died from her
injuries soon afterward.
William H. Beals, who now lies In the
Morgue, was an expert at his business.
He had been wafted toward the clouds
hundreds of times and such feats came to
be regarded by him as little more than
child's play, j As he hung in midair just
before the accident he performed feats
of daring on the bar of his parachute and
seemed to revel in the sport. It was not
until he was within a few feet of the
ground that he suddenly released his
hold, for some, unaccountable reason, and
pitched to the roadway beneath him. At
the same time Miss Madge Henney, a
pretty 17-year-old girl, residing at 1252
Folsom street, was being picked up with
a fractured skull and preparations were
being made to convey her to the Park
Hospital, where she expired. Her anx
iety to follow the flight of the unfortun
ate aeronaut brought her to a Bimllar
fate. While watching from a car her
head struck an electric pole, fracturing
her skull and throwing her to the side of
the track.

It on ETery Corner.
It is sometimes an easy matter to fool
the public, but you can't keep It up very
long. Thty are sure to find you out; and
every time a man is fooled another skep-
tic is made. Skepticism is allowable when
reading in a home newspaper about some
incident occurring in Maine or Iowa, but
the circumstances are entirely different
Â¦when it refers to some one right here at
home â frlendf and neighbors, people you
know, whom you can see and with whom
you can talk it over. This le the kind of
evidence at the back of Doan's Kidney
Pills â the home statements by home peo-
ple and the astonishing local work they
have been doing has caused more talk
among our citizens than tne doings of
any other modern wonder. Read the fol-
lowing:
W. P. Candy, employed In a fruit can-
nery, residence. SIS Minna street, says: "I
have gone out of my way to Induce
friends and acquaintances whom I knew
suffered from backache or kidney com-
plaint to use Doan's Kidney Pills; in fact,
J have never lost an opportunity to in-
dorse them very forcibly. I have good
reasons for so doing. I knew that ctj-
kidneys were either excited or weakened.
I knew I required some medicine to
Boothe. purify and wash them and I se-
lected Doan's Kidney Pills. They did the
work thoroughly, quietly and quickly."

Royal Friend, H. L. Meharry's fast
greyhound, took first honors at the open
stake yesterday at Ingleside Coursing
Park, beating Cloverdale In the deciding
course by a score of 16 to 7. Cloverdale
ruled favorite and at rlip time was a 1 to
2 choice. / â¢
As the dogs went up the field the odds
looked justifiable, as the dog that the tal
<-nt had placed its money on was out at
the lead a good five lengths. As soon as
they got to work Royal Friend showed his
cleverness and in a mix-up outpointed his
opponent and gained an easy victory.
It was a good day for the talent, though
the occasional short ends came through
at fair odds. Toward the end of the stake
Jerry Wright looked like a winner, but in
a bye with Doreen was taken a route
that put him out of the running. The
dogs were sent after a jack that led them
a chase all over the field. Slipper Ed
Shostag caught the hare as it neared the
slip stand and threw it over the fence.
The hounds had gone a full three minutes
and even with the assistance of four re
lief dogs were forced to let the hare out
foot them. Jerry Wright was a 1 to 4 shot,
but when the flag went up he was out
pointed by the bye dog.

Investors in consols and home rails last
week failed to neutralize the depressing
influences 1 which prevailed in the Ameri

case was owing to the reduced steel cor
poration dividend and the revelations re

troubles at Amsterdam and the reports
that the Scotch banks were squeezing
borrowers. The small purchases In con

The sound steamboat City of Worcester
of the Norwich line, which was supposed
to have struck on the rocks near Execu
tion light late last night, simply an
chored, because a metal pin connected
with the walking beam had broken.
While at anchor temporary repairs were
made and the City of Worcester, under
her own steam, made her way to her
dock In the North River. Captain Row
land attempted to transfer his 175 pas
sengers to the New Hampshire of the
Stonington line, which came up a short
time after the accident, but as the waves
were too high the attempt was aban
doned. More than 150 of the passengers
were sent to New London by train and
those that stood by the broken down boat
proceeded on her to their destination to
night.
NEW YORK, Oct. 11.â The fierce storm
that has been raging along the North At
lantic coast for several days has seri
ously Interfered with shipping, and to
day only four of the ocean liners, all of
which had been greatly delayed, succeed
ed in making port. The four steamships
that arrived reported hurricanes and
mountainous seas. The Monterey of the
Ward line and the Jefferson of the Old
Dominion line came in from the south.
The latter craft was terribly battered by
the storm and, when boarded by a high
wave on Saturday, Richard Mcl^ane, the
lookout,. was seriously Injured, the Rev.
B. Hawley, a clergyman of North Caro
lina, was thrown across the cabin and
killed.
Wave Kills a Passenger on the
Steamship Jefferson.
LINERS REPORT HURRICANES.
The neighbor telephoned to the Central
Emergency Hospital and Brockow was
taken there. Dr. Stevens found that he
had only suffered from shock. The grocer
said he had swallowed the bullet. He
was placed in a ward. He says he wants
to die, anyway, and that the next time
he tries he will raise his sight.
Brockow gave a final gulp, got the bul
let down, spat out the tooth and reached
up to see if his head was still in one
piece. Finding that it was, he looked dis
appointed.
The pain caused by an ulcerated tooth
drove Max Brockow to resolve to end hi"
own existence. The same tooth saved
Brockow's life. He tried to fire a- bullet
Into his head, but the ball struck the
tooth and Instead of entering Brockow's
brain was gulped down by him and near
ly choked him to death before it found ltÂ«
way into his, stomach.
All this chapter of Incidents took place
last night in the rear of a grocery at BOO
Franklin street, owned'! by Brockow. A
nelghobr, hearing the discharge of the re
volver, a 3S-caIlber Colt, ran Into the back
yard of the store -and found the grocer
sitting on a barrel, gasplngr for breath.
Smoke surrounded him and the pistol lay
on the ground tXBide him.
Speaking of the political outlook in this
country the Senator 6aid that he was
certain that President Roosevelt will be
renominated and will be re-elected by a
large majority. Three years ago Senator
Dietrich, who Is president of the German
National Bank of Hastings, was elected
G^ernor of Nebraska, but he resigned
that position to accept the Senatorial
nomination and was elected after the
deadlock In the Legislature of his State.
He expects to remain here only a few
days.
Returning to the subject of the Gov
ernment experimental station Senator
Dietrich remarked that he considered its
maintenance a waste of money and Its
further existence a folly. Continuing he
said:
What Alaska needs most are good wag-on
roads and more railroads. One should be built
between VaJde* and Eagle City on the Yukon
River, where it would penetrate a country rich
not only In minerals, but having a Just claim
to exceptional advantages in an agricultural
way. The commercial bodies on the entire
coast should take up this matter and encourage
some enterprising corporation to undertake the
construction* of the road, for it would be of
great benefit to the people in your State and
those north of California.
WASTE OF MONEY.
1 cleaned this latter information from the
â¢dentists in charge of the Government experi
mental station at Juneau, which I am sorry to
say during iti career haÂ« demonstrated nothing
further than had already been known for years
regarding: the agricultural possibilities of, the
Territory. At the station about three and a
half acre* of land have been cleared, and upon
this they have succeeded In crowing- nothing
but the ordinary garden truck. Nothing- has
been accomplished by experiment at the sta
tion to Â»how that cereals can be made paying
products of Alaska, and I doubt that farming
will ever be a success there for the reasons
stated already by me. Certain kinds of grasses
thrive and cattle-raising will eventually be one
of the Important industries of Alaska, a fact
that has already been realized by a number of
people who are busily engaged in shlpplnc
cattle there. As to Alaska's richness an a min
eral country, no one will dare dispute its
claims in this reepect.
There *r* of courite sections of ths Territory
where almost anything will grow, but the great
difficulty lies in the fact that it costs irom
ftSOO to $2000 an acre to clear the ground of its
timber and the layer of rotten wood and moss
that covers the soil.
COST OF CLEARING.
f United States Senator C. H. Dietrich of
Nebraska and fits daughter, who h&ve
been making an extended tour of Alaska,
arrived in port yesterday or! the United
States cutter Thetis and are registered
at the Palace Hotel. The. Senator and
Miss Dietrich left Seattle'last June for
Alaska, through which they have since
traveled many thousands of miles.
They spent about a month in and
around Dawson and, coming out by way
of the Yukon, they visited bÂ£ Michael
and other points of Interest. Returning
to the coast they boarded the Thetis,
which carried them up the coast to a
point near Point Barrow, which they were
prevented from reaching owing to the
ice. They also visited the DJamede Isl
ands and crossed the straits to the Sibe
rian coast, where the Thetis mado several
stops. In discussing his trip last even
ing the Senator said:
As a member of the Senate Land Committee
I discovered some months ago that we knew
very little about Alaska, and I concluded to
visit the country and see for myself Just what
it amounted to. A careful inspection of the ter
ritory has impressed me with its Importance
as a mineral country, but I have satisfied my
self that It will never be a successful agricul
tural district. /
The most striking scene of the burlesque
is the ''Storm" ballet in the second act.
Over 100 persons take part, ranging from
tiny children to plump womanhood. The
scene is Intended to symbolize, the pass
ing of a thunderstorm on a sunshiny day
and the idea is cleverly and elaborately
worked out with much beauty and grace.
Baby Jessamine, the smallest premier
danseuse in the world, appeared in this
scene and was heartily applauded.
The burlesque "Cleopatra" opened at
the Grand Opera-house at yesterday's
matinee and will hold the boards for the
remainder of the week- The dialogue is
worse than ordinary, but this is atoned
for by the scenery, music and ballets, all
of which are very beautiful.
The three Crane brothers present a
sketch which they call "The Mudtown
Minstrels." Nothing funnier has been
seen at the playhouse In many moons.
"Special announcement" will be a phrase
used all over town. The interlocutor In
troduces great singers and the music does
the rest. The nonsense these clever com
edians hand out would make a sick man
laugh himself into health. "Wallace
Brownlow's barytone voice must be heard
to be appreciated. In full and mellow
tones he rendered sweet melodies and
with dramatic power. He scored a hit.
The Rappo sisters, famous Russian
dancers, are very graceful and their ef
forts were highly appreciated. The Golden
Gate Quartet, assisted by Fanny Wlnfred,
has new songs and changes this week
and is as popular as before. Wood and
Ray present "The Old Jokes'. Home."
The sketch gives Ray a chance to show
his versatility as a comedian. The Pant
zer trio present "A Gymnast's Parlor En
tertainment." The work by the girls is
remarkable. The clown Is also very
funny. Clayton White and Marie Stew
art repeat the success they achieved last
week in the one-act comedy, "Paris."
Miss Stewart is a clever woman and her
imitations and general all-round acting
have won her many admirers In this city.
White also does some good work as
Max the Goat, a ward heeler. A. P. Ros
tow, the world's famous equilibrist, closes
a splendid show.
Colomblno is the bright particular star
In a galaxy at the Orpheum this week.
He Is a marvelous change artist and kept
his audience In a state of wonder by the
rapidity In which he changed his cos
tumes In playing a sketch which called
for the Impersonation of nine characters.
This In itself is well worth seeing, but
he goes one better by caricaturing the
world's famous musicians. The Orpheura's
splendid orchestra furnishes the music
and he leads the men in selections that
have become familiar to all lovers of
music. His take-oft on Mascagni, Sousa
and CreatorÂ©, leaders who have been
seen In this city, were extremely funny
and created a great deal of merriment.
There are some catchy songs, which are
fairly well sung. The chorus is well
gowned and some clever dance steps are
thrown Into the general potpourl.
Ed Garvie, the old-time Orpheum fa
vorite and all-round funny man. ap
peared at the California Theater last
night bm Mr. Jolly of Joliet- A packed
house testified to the appreciation with
which he is held by the theater-goers of
the city, who have not yet finished laugh-
Ing at the gags he usÂ£d to perpetrate
when he was .with Peter Daly.
The musical frivolity with which Gar
vie Is starring Is nothing more than tho
stereotyped conglomeration of shuffles,
brassy voiced songs and rough and tum
ble which passes on the circuit nowadays.
It Is sufficient, however, to give Garvie a
chance to use his nail factory voice and
make the people laugh. Miss Mollie
Thompson has a voice though, which, to
quote one of Mr. Jolly's songs, "skins his
a city block." It alone is worth the price
of admission.
Hancock subsequently brought suit In
the Superior Court for the unpaid balance
of the year's salary, amounting to $600,
ar?d obtained Judgment. An appeal was
then taken by the city. Simultaneously
another suit was brought by Miss Mary
A. Polk, a teacher of the High School, on
the same grounds. This case was tried
with the same result and the decision of
the Supreme Court covers both cases.
The main point of the decision is that
contracts entered into with teachers by
one school board must be carried out by
succeeding boards and that salaries must
be paid during the life j of the contract
except In cases where service Is discon
tinued by mutual consent. The Hancock
and Polk cases have been before the
courts for the past -three years.
SANTA BARBARA. Oct. 11.â Word has
Just been received that the State Supreme
Court has decided the case of John O.
Hancock, formerly principal of the Santa
Barbara High School, against the City
Board of Education. The decision Is of
great Interest to all the school boards in
California. Hancock was dismissed by the
Board of Education, which succeeded th"e
High School Board, the latter being legis
lated out of existence. Hancock, who had
served only a few months, declined to ac
cept the order of dismissal, exhibiting a
written contract with the High School
Board to serve during one school year.
The Board of Education repudiated the
contract.
The executive committee was authorized
to make arrangements for a meeting of
the members cf the camps and steps were
taken for active participation In the cam
paign.
Resolutions were unanimously adopted
indorsing the ticket nominated by the Re
publican party and pledging the support
of the camps of the Army and Navy Re
publican league in San Francisco for the
entire ticket.
Enthusiastic speeches were made by
Comrades Salomon. Chamberlain, Hyde,
Wisker. Bandon. Kinney, Blackburn, Hef
fendon, Laux, Parks, Cahen and others.
Hon. A. P. Williams, whose judgment
cf political conditions is the result of long
experience in campaign committee work,
recently told an audience of Republican
business men at the Union League Club
that the race in this campaign was be
tween Crocker and Schmitz. An incident
occurred last night that sustains the
cpinion of Senator Williams. City Attor
ney Lane and Mayor Schmitz were intro
duced In social fashion to a large audi
cr.ee of Germans at Eintracht Hall. The
Mayor got considerable applause, but the
City Attorney received little, other than
that which he bestowed on himself. The
latters early record as a Prohibitionist
tr.ay account in a measure for the lack of
German enthusiasm for his candidacy.
Henry J. Crocker has received assurance
cf the strongest character, that the Ger
man Republicans intend to" stand by his
party ticket in the contest.
A meeting of the representatives of the
several camps of the Army and Navy Re-
I ublican League In San Francisco was
hi'.d yesterday at the headquarters of
i he league. 415 Montgomery street-
It was decided to take an active and
energetic part in the municipal election
and an executive committee was ap
pointed, consisting of J. H. Hilton, chair
man: Solomon Kahn. F. G. WIsker, E.
H. Herri ck, W. J. Ruddick, J. C. Cur
rier and J. A. Whitesides. "W. C. Alber
gr-r was appointed secretary.
He thrrw party principles to the winds
end went out for votes. The failure of
his present rlan to cut away from his
fellow candidates on the Democratic mu
nicipal ticket In order to gain special
privileges ir. the Labor party causes gen
eral merriment along the line. Gavin Mr-
Nab is not without resources In political
emergency, and he may do something to
equare Lane with the other nominees. He
can at least detail a gang of Democratic
job-chasers to organize a union labor
J>ane club, but he will be obliged to let
in Sam Braunhart. Billy Hynes and Oscar
Hocks on the ground floor.
The talk goes that Mayor Schmitz is as
mad as a March hare over what he Is
plervsed to term the unprincipled attitude
of Lane. Mayor Schmitz ought to inves
tigate the campaign methods of several
of his own political henchmen. If stories
current along the line are not wholly
false some of the Schmitz workers in the
half-world are appealing to the most de
praved and degraded members of the hu
man race for political support.
A COOL RECEPTION.
FAILURE OF PLAN.
The Lane fizzle at the Turk-street Tem
ple Saturday night was a significant inci
dent of the campaign. Lane started out
to organize a union labor Lane club, and
rÂ«s not able to bring to the meeting more
than twenty men. Lane's associates on
the Democratic ticket are actually "chort
ling with jf>>" over the fizzle. The fact is
rÂ«-called that Lene went into the guberna
torial tight holding fast to ono office while
seeking another, and cut loose from all
his fellow candidates on the Democratic
ticket to make an individual fight. In
order to catoh Republican votes he turned
his back on I he Democratic platform, and
lauded the policies of President Roose-
The vast attendance at the Alhambra
Theater last Saturday night, together
with the epirlt of loyalty to the Repub
lican cause shown by the audience, re
moved every shadow of doubt regarding
the attitude of the great mase of Repub
lican voters in this campaign. The party
is unite*! and confident of success*.
REPUBLICANS UNITED.
The Colon League of San Francisco has
informed the members of the Republican
campaign committee that It desires to
conduct one meeting under the auspices
of the club. There is talk of engaging the
Mechanics' Pavilion for one evening this
rnonth for the rally. Ten-minute speeches
will be the rule, and ten or twelve speak
er* representing workirgmen and business
men will deliver addresses.
The greeting given to Henry J. Crocker
attained the force and character of a
grf>at popular ovation. He was hailed by
thousands as the next Mayor of San
Francisco. The "hall was not half large
enough to accommodate all the citizens
that went to Jones and Eddy streets to
st-Â«Â» and hear Henry J. Crocker and his
ai-sociates on the ticket. Hundreds went
away, seeing that even standing room in
sidÂ«; was taken.
Th* magnitude of the Republican dem
onstration last Saturday night was the
leading topic of comment in the city yes
ttrday. The Democrats had a good meet
ing last Wednesday evening:, the audience
being a little larger than that which as
sembled early In the campaign to ratify
the nominations of the Union Labor
party. The Republican meeting, how
ever, in point of attendance and enthu
siasm outclassed all other political dem
orstrations cf the present campaign.
Referee Middleton repeatedly warned
the Spanish players against rough tactics
during the game, but evidently to no ac
count.
David Schloss, right tackle, was woe
fully mawled, and as a resu-- had his
collarbone fractured. Then in quick order
Frank Soule, right half, received a whiz
zing blow on the nose, and It was evident
at once that he was suffering much pain.
An examination showed that his nose had
been broken. Harry Stone, captain of the
team, also fell a victim to the rough play.
He suffered a broken leg, and In spite of
the pain he continued playing for several
seconds after he received the serious In
jury- The three maimed were taken to the
Presidio hospital, and later Schloss was
conveyed to the Park Emergency Hos
pital.
There was a game played at the Pre
sidio Athletic Grounds yesterday after
noon between the Arlington football club,
composed of members' of the First Bat
talion of Artillery. N. G. C, and La Union
club, which is made up of Spaniards w,ho
reside In San Francisco.
From the very beginning the Spaniards
Â¦were In a condition of physical and men
tal determination that the game should
go to them. With an enthusiasm that
hinged on ferocious excitement the game
was played with rough-and-tumble tactics
that would put in the shade those em
ployed at a bullfight.
There were only three men of the Ar
lington club laid low, and the only won
der is that there were not more. Their
injuries were such as to necessitate sur
gical aid, and for some weeks two at least
of the three will keep their beds under
medical care.
When Spanish and American football
devotees meet in friendly rivalry on the
field of sport it would be well, judging
from a game played on the outskirts of
the city yesterday, to have a corps of sur
geons and a half-dozen ambulances on the
spot.
LONDON, Oct. 11.â Ths Interesting an
nouncement la madÂ© to-night that the
new Marquis of Salisbury (late Viscount
Cranborne) will enter the Cabinet as Lord
of the Privy Seal, the office held by his
father until his retirement last year,
when Balfour assumed the post, without

SCOURING YOUB SCALP.
Will Remove the Loose Dandruff
Scales, but It Won't Cure Dandruff.
If your hair is brittle and thinning, you hÂ«vÂ»
dandruff. ThÂ« mere scouring' of the scalD of
the loose scales won't cure dandruff; because
dandruff is nothing but scales of scalp being
thrown up by a pestiferous little germ In bur-
rowing its war to the root of the hair. wh<*rÂ»
it saps the. vitality, causing falling hair and.
In time, baldness. Now you can't stop dan-
druff nor falling; bair. nor prevent bahtaesa
unless you destroy that Rerm; and the only
preparation that can do it is the new scien-
tific discovery. Newbro 1 * Herpicide. In fact
no othÂ«r hair preparation claims to kill the
dandruff germ â all of them will clean thÂ«
scalp: soaD and water will do that, but on!y
Newbro's Herpidde gets at the root of thÂ»
trouble and kills thÂ« dandruff germ. Sold *>y

Angels Win in the Ninth.
Kasfball is a <juwr gamt, and no one
<ar. tell how a contest Is goins to finish.
".'h;s was shown yesterday, when the Na
11VP5 headed the Angels at the start and
hold the lead all the way. When the time
< air/ to call it off the home team had
, accumulated four against three for the
southerners, and this one tally not only
cave them the game, but the series. They
t-hould have captured the morning game
.also, but the winning combination was
broken up in the last round, and so the
Angels get away with the gloryâ 5 to 4.
"Pewee" LJndsey committed another
heroic Btunt when he- beat the giants at
Recreation Parkâ the third one that he
has piled up this week. He hurled his
Jeft wing aguinst that of the great Doc
Newton, and the latter was found want
ing wijere the little lad was the goods. ' I
SOUTHPAW INVTJXNERABLE.
Inning after inning: went by, and etill
the Ar.gels could not solve the offerings
of thÂ© tiny southpaw. The crowds in the
Et&n<!s and the multitude in the bleachers
yellÂ«d Ilka mad, and their shouts seemed
to encourage the tiny one, for the longer
he pitched the better he became.
In the first Inning Danny Bhay brought
homo a run for Uncle. He worked the
medical left-winder for a pass to first.
end iteany advanced him on an out. Ger
many Krug responded with a dazzler to
center, and Danny trotted to the rubber.
But the Angels also came through In their
half of the *ame round. Two were gone
when big Smith hit for two bags, and the
fans had not got over the shock ere Cap
r>illon Boused the. ball to right field and
Pmith scooted home.
The third round produced one more bun.
die o* joy for the home crowd. Shay
worked another base on balls and then
Etole second. While Newton was prepar
ing to unwind himself to deliver a curve
Danny pilfered third, and the fanatics
screeched and yelled for a fare-ye-well.
Meany rapped the leather into Toman's
Urrttory. and while the little fellow was
tielding the ball to first Shay arrived with
the run.
SEVENTH IS EVENTFUL.
It wa t a deadlock again in the same
round. Cravath led off with a two-cush
ioncr to right. Lindsey tried to catch him
Bleeping off the bag and threw the ball
wide. This advanced the runner to sec
ond. Toman laid down a bunt and Cra
â¢ dashed fcÂ«r the plate, and was there
while the runner was being fielded out.
But the bij stunt came off in the sev
enth. Lynch led off with a nice single.
\ nnd Delmas bunted. Newton booted the
li&ll and both runners were safe. Then
Raymond sacrificed them up a notch.
I-indsey went out, Toman to Spies, but
while the play waÂ«< boing made Lynch
.scored. Shay practically won the game
t&ea and there when he lined out a peach
to center, bringing in Delmas with the
last run for I.'ncle.
The Angels got one more In their half
Â«*f the seventh, but they quit there and
were through for the day. They made
many and depperate efforts to tie up the
'result in the last two rounds, but L'ndsoy
was in the way all the time, and they
could not hit him when a hit meant a
.Tun and a tie. The score:

G. Fitschen of Butte, Mont., one of San
Francisco's oldest marksmen, was on the
range, and spent the day in renewing old
acquaintanceships. . He took especial
pride In exhibiting the gold medal he won
at Alameda Schuetzen Park hi 1865 for
being the best shot in his company.
The event of the day was the fourth
annual eagle shooting of the Hannover
aner Verein. Much enthusiasm and ex
citement prevailed during the course of
the contest as piece after piece of the bird
was shot down. The excitement reached
the climax when Carsten Luhrs stepped
to the front and by a well-directed shot
brought down the last piece of the eagle,
thus making him the king of the festival.
He was immediately surrounded by his
comrades, who placed him in a chair,
mounted on a table, and carried him over
the grounds to the pavilion, where he was
crowned with the inslenia of his office
by Misses Henrietta Hillman and Annie
Vorwinkel. After a few well chosen
remarks. King Luhrs invited his subjects
to partake of refreshments.
The success of the festival was largely
due to the committee of arrangements,
composed of Herman Schult, president;
Chris ' Roeber. secretary; Frederick Eg
gers, Charles Kruse, Joseph Schllcht
rnann.
Shell Mound Park range was well filled
with riflemen yesteVday. The shooting
conditions were all that could bu expected,
consequently many good scores were
made. The Hannovaner Verein held its
annual king shooting and turned out the
full strength of the company. The Golden
Gate Rifle and Pistol Club, Deutscher
Kreiger Verein, San Francisco Schuetzen
Verein, Germania Schuetzen Club, Nord
deutscher Schuetzen Club and Independ
ent Rifles all held monthly contests.
A- man somewhat under . the Influence
of liquor walked up to Policeman F. H.
Flynn on Montgomery street yesterday
afternoon and said he was a deserter
from the army and as his conscience had
been"troubling him he wanted to give
himself up. He said his name was Arthur
H. Jones and he was a member of Com
pany C, Fifth Infantry, in 1899 and de
serted while the regiment was in Cuba.
He was locked up in. the City Prison and
the military authorities will be notified.
Says He Is a Deserter.
The main event of the evening will bÂ« a
mixup between . William Stewart, the
husky navy scrapper, and "Rough House"
Billy McDonald, the terror of the local
welter class. Another good bout Is, the
one arranged between Louis Balletro and
Johh Roberts. Both are big heavy-weights
and are there with the punch. .

HAYES. VALLEY CLUB
(Â¥0. ARRANGES GOOD CARD
A large crowd of amateur sailors and
their friends witnessed the aquatic sports
given by the Sjn Francisco Yacht Club
yesterday at Sausalito. The day Waa
ideal, the air being warm, delightfully
clear and brilliant. The piazzas of the
clubhouse were filled with ladies in light
dresses and yachtsmen in natty nautical
costumes.
The first event, a swimming race for
niembers of the Olympic Club, was won
by H. Hinkel. A siniilar event for mem
bers of the San FTancisco Yacht Club
was won by R. W. Mason. Kirat prize
in the high divlnt contest was won by
J. Wise of the Olympic Club and second
prize by Giannini of the San Francisco
Yacht Club. The treble scullin? race in
the club barges was won by the crew of
the yawl Royal, made up of Dr. J. No
vltzky, bow; George Urquhart. waist;
Frank Maino. stroke, and W. L. Suther
land, coxswain. The swimming and dress
ing race excited a great deal of amuse
ment amons the spectators, each con
testant having to swim to three or four
yachts and don an article of attire on
each. R. W. Mason captured this event.
Several competitors essayed to walk tha
greasy pole, but all except R. W. Mason,
who appeared in feminine dress and was
disqualified for wearing stockings, failed
to reach the fiag at the end of the pole.
The double sculling race, in which
blindfolded competitors pulled according
to the directions of a rudderless lady cox
swain, was won by W. W. Haley and
his crew of the sloop Ariel. A crew of
the yacht Ariel also won the skiff race,
using the hands as paddles, and climbing
to the crosstrees of the yacht, where the
prize was hung.
A contest, in which a man armed with a
lonsr pole padded at the point and pro
pelled In a skiff by an oarsman, charged
another similarly equipped competitor,
endeavoring to push him from the boat
into the water, was won by Bradford of
the Olympic Club. Sydney Cavlll. the
swimming instructor of the Olympic Club,
gave an interesting and clever swimming
exhibition, in whjch he Imitated a seal,
a submarine boat, a lady swimmer, a
drowning man. etc. A race in Canadian
canoes was won by the two men in the
green craft, the couple In the red one
capsizing on rounding the stakeboat,
when they had a substantial lead.
The small yacht regatta,- for boats of
twenty feet and under, was won by the
yawl Witch, Angeline being second. The
sloops Alice, Zada and Mistral also com
peted. The course was from the bows of

marks on the port hand and finishing at
the point of starting. The wind was light
during the race.

the club on October 24.
The handicap singles tournament with
Its 104 entries was commenced on the park
tennis courts yesterday. The preliminary
round and part of the first round were
finished. The pleasant weather brought
out a large crowd of spectators, who were
treated to all kinds of matches. Some
were close and interesting, while the ma
jority were one-sided and devoid of skill.
Considering the large entry list the han
dicapping was well done. Most of the
poorer players were disposed of and the
matches from now on will be closer and
more interesting. None of the men, on
scratch or below lost except Grant Smith,
who defaulted.
R. N. Whitney, playing from "15 2-6"
back of scratch, had a hard time beat
ing Charles Dunlap. who was "2-Â«" behind
scratch. Whitney lost the first set, but
won the next two cleverly.
G. D. MacGavin. the crack California
Club player, showed his class when he
allowed Clarence Foley odds of "owe li"
and won In straight sets. Foley wa3
thought to have an excellent chance, bui
MacGavin won with little difficulty.
Clarence Grlffln and Norman Ambrose
played the closest and most exciting
match. Griffin allowed Ambrose "owe
2-6" and the handicap proved to be about
right. The third and deciding set ran
up to 9-7, and finally went to Griffln.
Horace Mann and Alonzo McFarlanct
also figured in a three-set match. All
three sets were 6-4 and two of them
went to Mann. Harry Rolfe won bom
his matches cleverly and reached the sec
ond round. He will meet Neil Baker oa
even terms and a good match will rÂ«
sult.

HANDBAXL EXPERTS PLAY
FAST EOTJB-HANDED GAME
Hampton and Levy and Bonnet and
Nealon BTeak Even After Six
Hot Games.
As usual the hard handball court of the
Olympic Club was crowded with specta
tors yesterday. The series of match
games which have been played for the
past two months brought many enthusi
asts to the clubhouse. James Fitzgerald,
the world's champion, was to have played
Jack Bonnet and Al Hampton yesterday,
but owing to a business engagement was
unable to show up. In order that the
spectators might not be disappointed a
four-handed game was made up between
Jack Bonnet and J. C. Ne&lon against
Al Hampton and Louis Levy. They play
ed six of the fastest games seen In the
club in months. Each side took three
games.
Bonnet's terrific toss and Nealon's
splendid playing- were features. Hampton
suffered a bad shoulder and did not play
up to form. However, he was in every
play and x Â»dld great work. Levy's show
ing was very good. He has not been
playing as long as the others, but Is rap
idly becoming an expert. The scores
were 21-16. 21-12. 21-15, &-21. 18-21, 2-21. Nea
lon played Levy a single-handed game
and beat him by 8 points. Although an
aged man Nealon plays a remarkable
game. He drives the ball with great
force and commands it nicely. Fitzgerald
and Bonnet and Hampton will play next
Sunday. The soft handball tournament
will open at the Olympic Club to-night.

Dr. Alexander J. Mclvor-Tyndall enter
tained and mystified a large audience at
Steinway Hall last night with demonstra
tions in occult phenomena. It was one or
the most brilliant gatherings of the sea
son, and the famous psychic scientist was
In excellent trim. - He delivered an excel
lent discourse on the destructive power of
thought, citing many, cases of personal
experience: where thought vibrations of a
certain potentiality have been instru
mental in producing chemical changes in
the human organism that have . resulted
in death, or, as he calls it, disintegration.
Dr. .Molvor-Tyndall ia a' bold and original
thinker, and while he Is probably manv
years in advance of the age with his pe
culiar views of life, yet he adheres to the
latest developments of material science in
expressing his novel theories of the psy
chological side of life. The lecture was
evidently much appreciated and was re
ceived with enthusiasm.
Dr. Tyndall's Lecture.
It may be noted in passing that the manipulators
of these unnatural combinations have had an excel
lent excuse, from their standpoint, for thejr attacks
on President Roosevelt and their accusation that he
is the cause of the tumbling of their card house.
With a very clear prevision he saw, the end from the
beginning. He saw that ' these over-capitalized
schemes were destined to collapse when the people
ceased to buy inflated stocks. Therefore he insisted
upon a degree of publicity that would warn the people
against such investment. His course made it impos
sible for the underwriting syndicate to sell stocks at
thirty times their actual value and so caused the col
lapse of the shipbuilding trust and the present down
fall of every watered combination. He has rendered
a public service as great as that of Mr. Cleveland
when he sustained the public credit against exactly
such a proposition in linance. His fame has outlived
the denunciation of the mefn who wanted to water all
the money of the country by falling to a silver basis
and making the people take 45 cents for 100 cents. ."
President Roosevelt started the machinery of the
law in motion, and though the trust organs have at-
THE disclosures incident to the examination of
the affairs of the shipbuilding trust h, av e prob
ably struck a death blow to future combinations
of capital by means having no other motive than
enrichment of the promoters. It seems quite sure
that the power of J. Pierpont Morgan is broken and
that no other will succeed him as the wizard of com
bination. We long ago predicted that the time would
come when every over-capitalized enterprise would
get the water squeezed out of it and the people would
be taught once for all that there was a^atural limit
to combination beyond which no artifice, no matter
how cunning and expert, could sustain business in
violation of the natural laws of commerce.
It is well that this time has come now. The coun
try can stand the consequences. There is a slowing
up of trade and cautionary signals are abundant, but
legitimate operations will sustain the shock. There
is no use trying to conceal the fact that it is the most
serious, in all our industrial and financial history. It
is great in proportion to the wide departure from cor
rect principles which has caused it. Ten years ago
it would have convulsed the commerce of the coun
try from the top down to the smallest peanut stand,
for we were largely in debt abroad and our public
finances were disordered at home. Now the foreign
balance against us is imperceptibly small and our
finances arc on a far sounder basis.
THE TRUSTS TUMBLING.
Under the benign influence of American institu
tions, encouraged and enforced at the point of the
bayonet, the Moros have decided that they will have
no more slave hunting in their provinces. This con
cession to our civilization is encouraging. It may
not be too much to expect that when the Moros
fight with us, in consequence of periodical disagree
ments, they will decide to restrict their operations
to what we are pleased to call civilized warfare.
The country's bank clearings are still running be
hind those of 1002, the loss last week being 137 per
cent, though the aggregate clearings have increased
sharply during the past ten days from the low point
of Si ,400,000,000 to the good showing of $2,180,000,000.
The loss in percentage is not uniform, about half of
the largest cities exhibiting gains over 1902. Fail
ures last week were 223, against 245 for the same week
last 3'ear. Our foreign trade diminished last week,
both imports and exports falling off, though the loss
in both was not^eaw.
Conditions in Wall street have not been satisfactory
of late, as the sinister developments in connection
with the internal affairs of the United States Steel and
Shipbuilding trusts have still further shaken 'public
confidence in the stock market The great trusts
seem to, have reached that point predicted several
years ago by Henry Clews, the astute and
far-seeing New York banker, who even then saw
what was coming and said that the public need not
worry about the huge trusts â they would settle them
selves if given rope enough and left alone.
The iron and steel trade furnishes the most notable
example of this increase in production and decrease
in demand. The United States Steel Corporation re
ports that its orders now are 1,000,000 tons less than
a year ago, whereas on the 1st of January they were
1,000.000 tons larger than at the same time the year
before, while all the leading producers of pig iron
have agreed to cut down the output. The New Eng
land cotton mills are running on reduced time and
some are storing their products. The footwear fac
tories of the same section report operations fair,
though prices are less satisfactory and the margin of
profit is smaller. The cotton crop is not turning out
as well as anticipated and the movement at New
Orleans is being deranged by a labor strike.
Provisions continue to <frag at Chicago and other
Western centers and the market is being held up, as
private reports from Chicago express it, "by sheer
muscle." The tendency in farm staples is now down
ward rather than upward and cereals on the Chicago
Board of Trade are weak. There is one good feature
to this, which is that if the American wheat' market
keeps down to the European export basis we shall be
in a position to sell wheat to Europe, whereas for
months we were handicapped in this business by our
own high prices. The same condition applies to pig
iron. Increased production and lower prices will
rheck our importations of this product from abroad
and may increase our local business. So lower grain
md iron markets are not altogether an unmixed evil.
Dry goods are reported quieter at New York and
Texas reports some falling off in business there and
in other parts of the Southwest, largely owing to the
Dackv.-ardness of the cotton crop. But no trouble in
rollections from this cause has yet been reported.
The continuation of labor troubles, though by no
means as acute as some months ago, is diminishing
building operations, reducing the demand for
structural material and making the lumber market
The best reports are still from the western half of
the country and the very best are from the Pacific
slope, where the volume of business is keeping up
excellently. The railroad earnings still lead those of
last year by about 8 per cent, and while the com
plaints of car shortage are by no means as numerous
or loud as for several years past, there is still a de
ficiency in cars to move the goods tendered the rail
roads.
TRADE conditions are undergoing a decided
change. Everybody now sees it. Close com
mercial observers have seen it coming for
months. But the change is in the nature of a sur
prise to even the latter and is but another illustration
of the old saying that .we never know how things are
going to turn out. In the first place the money mar
ket, which everybody expected would be stringent at
this time when the crops are beginning to move, is
not particularly so, and in fart is easier than it was
some months ago. In the ft-cond place there is a
pronounced downward tendeircy in prices for almo-t
everything, accompanied by larger supplies of almost
all products. In other words production has at last
overtaken consumption and in many lines is now
passing it. This means lower prices for these prod
uct* and indicates that the cost of living from now
on will decrease rather than increase. It was not
expected that this increase in supplies and recession
in prices would occur before next spring, but it is
even now with us.
The church of which he has been rector in
New York St, Bartholomew's, is an institution
of enormous wealth and Influence including
in- the parish church proper many of the rich
est people in New York City, and reaching
through its missions and other organization*
thousands of the .very poorest. The steady
way In Â¦ which Dr. Greer has developed thle
great enterprise has. drawn to him the eyes of
the whole church.
Everybody Jn our church . respects Dr. Greer
for his ability and also for his absolute inde
pendence and sincerity.* I do not think that
Dr" Greer can be regarded as a "party" man
In any narrow sense. - His early training was
that of the - "evangelical" or "low church"
school, I believe, but he-has undoubtedly out
grown the ' narrow â¢ Influences of an earlier day.
At the convention in New . York Dr. Greer
was nominated by the rector of Trinity Church
Rev. Morgan Dix, who Is known as . a Cath
olic churchman, and -I understand that he waa
finally voted for by every member of the con
vention. Evidently all men respect . him and
feel that they can trust him. - That " he will
keep his . word .and be absolutely Â¦ fair Â¦ In. his
episcopal Judgment Is beyond question.

Gregx-took a stand on the question of divorce
which surprised everybody by Its vehemence.

The Rev. Herbert Parrish, rector of the
Church of the Advent, estimated Dr.
Greer as a man of .very brilliant gifts
and of tried stability of character. He
said:
HIGH CHTJKCH OPINION.
Dr Greer was called to St. Bartholomew's
parish in New. York in 1888. He was when
called the rector of Grace Church atsProvl
tience R. I. His Held waa limited there. He
ranked easily first among the Episcopal clergy
in Rhode Island. The tall to New lork af
forded him a splendid opportunity for ha
powers I was assistant at St. Bartholomew s
Church when he was made rector. I had an
opportunity therefore to know personally about
"I W have found a gold mine," to he said to me,
alludln to Â£>.. Bartholomew's. The wea.ui
of the congregation at that time was estimated
to be $200,00O.0C0. For. two years Dr. Greer
worked quietly, making no special move, but he
devoted all this time to pastoral work preach
ing and examining the field. In the third year
of his rectorship he entered upon the perform
ance of his plans, and aU the years since have
brought continual developme-K oftlw wok
He built a parish-house that cost almost 41.
000,000. In that building services are held in
five different languages. He was. the first cler
gyman in New York to come to the assistance
of the poor in rescuing them from the clutoa^a
of the usurers or money lenders, who were tak
ing enormous Interest. He established a large
pawnshop, and in every possible way guarded
the poor, trying always to preserve their seif
resnect In the pulpit he has been one of the
leaders' of New York City and of the entire
East. He is a bold, fearless, practical, aggres
sive preacher, who never Â¦ fails to spÂ«>ak '.he
truth In t'.ils way ,more than in a.ny other,
possibly, he won the respect and love of his
congregation. - 'Â¦ â â¢ ' *'
He is one of the few men who have remark
able pulpit power with - strong administrative
ability His churchinanshlp is broad, tolerant,
comprehensive. He is. unquestionably, well
suited for the bishopric of such a diocese as
New York. . He will be a leader of men.
He has declined other elections. He was
elected Bishop of "Western Massachusetts some
years ago. but declined the honor. If he hart
not demurred he would have been made Bishop
Coadjutor of Pennsylvania two years ago. He
is the logical successor of Blifccp Potter of the
diocese of New York. This ia true because of
his position and other reasons. He was rector
of St. Bartholomew's parish In New York. He
has great influence and popularity with all
schools of thought In the church. He has been
in New York as the rector of St. Bartholomew's
parish for a long time. He has widened tae
work of that parish into all sorts of usefulness.
He has greatly stimulated the missionary work.
The election of Dr. Greer as coadjutor to
Bishop Potter is of Importance to all the
church. When he accepted the appointment hÂ«
said that "one thing, however, you could not
and cannot, and I am sure would not compel
me to do; you would not compel me to be la*
bishop of any pa.rty or any school of thought In
this diocese or in the church at large."
This Indicates the man very well. If those
who represent various views in 'the church are
united In the selection of a bishop of the most
prominent diocese in the United States as they
were on the occasion of the election .of Dr.
Greer. that certainly tends to unity in the
church and help practically. He will not be a
partisan in ofnee. He has endeared himself by
his independence of character. I
The Rev. Dr. Clampett said that he re
garded the election of Dr. Greer as coad
jutor to Bishop Potter as a great thing
for the Episcopal church, and continued:
This Is the view of Right Rev. Bishop
Nichols:
BISHOP NICHOLS' VIEWS.
Among Episcopalians on the Pa
cific Coast there is the liveliest interest
In this fact and what it implies. Promi
nent clergymen in this city believe that
his advent as coadjutor to Bishop Potter
Is fraught with great good for the Prot
estant Episcopal Church.
NO more potent voice was raised In
this city on the floor of the general
convention of the Protestant Epis
copal church, two years ago, than
that of the Rev.- David H. Greer of
New York. He became a marked figure
while in San Francisco. His vehemence
in the convention on the subject of di
vorces and his pulpit oratory alike char
acterized him for earnestness and re
vealed to his delighted listeners that be
fore them stood a man such as all Ameri
cans likeâ one who was not afraid to
speak his thoughts fearlessly and fully.
The press dispatches have brought from
the East the meager announcement only
that Dr. Greer haa been appointed coad
jutor to Bishop Potter of the diocese of
New York. That bare statement means
to church men that Dr. Greer has become
In fact the foremost man of the Prot
estant Episcopal church in the United
States. /
TRADE CONDITIONS CHANGING
The Episcopal church holds unitedly to a
few essentials. It leaves a broad field for dis
cussion. It is important that Dr. Greer is not
a party man. He will be the most prominent
man in the church and he will be listened to
with ?reat attention. >.
"When Dr. Greer was elected Bishop co
adjntor he wasp nominated by a high
churchman. The nomination was second
ed by a broad' churchman and the first
ballot showed -so large a majority, made
up of votes from all parties, that all Idea
of partisan bias was entirely disproved.
When the bishopric was accepted by Dr.
Greer he was escorted by a committee
consisting: of Dr. J. Lewis Parks, J. P.
Morgan and W. R. Grosvenor and waa
received by Bishop Potter. The two par
agraphs of Dr. Greer's address on ac
cepting the appointment that will at
tract the most general attention upon the
part of churchmen in all parts of the
United States are as follows:
One thing, however, you could not and can
not, and, I am sure, would not, compel me to
do You would not compel me to be the bishop
of any party or school of thought In this dio
cese or in the church at large.
I recognize the fact that beneath the sur
face, however diversified that surface may be,
there Is a deep and loyal devotion to our com
mon Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, There is
no name that can so touch and sway* our hearts
as that name. That name is the one that I
shall recognize, and that personality is the one
that I shall try to serve.
Dr. Greer will be hailed by us all with de- j
light In his new position. While there is no j
primacy, or archbishop, in the American Epls- I
copal ehurch, yet the bishopric of . the diocese ',
of New York, by reason of the prominence of j
the diocese, has great-weight. It la the largest <
and most prominent diocese of the Episcopal
church in the United States. ..' ;
Dr. Gre*r will not have a party bias. He !
Is thoroughly bread in his sympathies.. Preju- j
dice In favor of this or of that opinion haa j
no place in hi9 composition. He has made of '
St. Bartholomew's parish a perfect Christian i

The Rev. Dr. B. M. "W'eeden, rector of
St. Luke's Church, said:
ALL' PABTIES SATISFIED.
There is not the slightest possibility of a
row in our church about ritualism, either in
New York . or elsewhere. The Bishops recog
nize thoroughly that incense, lights, vestments
and all the ceremonies of the mass are strictly
legal in the American church. The prejudice
about ritual, due to historical reasons in con
nection with the Church of Rome, is rapidly
dying out. Slowly but surely Catholic cere
monial Is being adopted In all of our churches.
There is no attempt made to oppose the Cath
olic movement. Moreover, the old errors Identi
fied with the names "low church" and "broad
church" are gradually passing away. If there
are any "parties" --in our church, and a church
to be alive must have "parties," there is, at
least, with very few exceptions, a mutual cour
tesy and charity which unites them in a bond
stronger than their differences.
Dr. Greer, however, is rather a practical
man of affairs than a scholar or theologian.
He is regarded as a man of wide reading In
general lines, and he is a striking preacher.
His popularity is the more remarkable in that
Dr. Qreer Is peculiar and absolutely frigid in
manner. He has a waxed mustache, parts his
hair in the middle and dresses like an affected
floorwalker of a fashionable dry-goods store â
which would impress one atjfnrst somewhat
unfavorably. Respect for hijh, however, grows
with acquaintance. He is honest, fearless, able
and kind.
indissolublllty of marriage. He has expressed
himself publicly since on the same subject with
even greater force. There . was a fear at one
time that "low" or "broad" views on the
subject of divorce would make some way In the
church, especially in fashionable New York.
The election of Dr. Greer Is an indication that
the diocese of New York will not favor laxity
on the divorce question.

The school near San Luis Obispo is the first of its
kind in respect to location.- Heretofore such institu
tions have been placed in the large cities. This one
is practically in the country, in > the midst of whole
some surroundings, where those who seek to enjoy
its opportunities will not be diverted by the allure
ments of a great city. To it the country youth may
be expected to resort. Successful ranch manage
ment in California requires such a school. The
owner or the foreman of a ranch should know how to
shot a horse, to plan and build, to take machinery
down and set it up. In the near future electric
power is to be extensively used in running Califor
nia ranches. It will operate pumps, distribute water,
run stationary, machines for threshing grain and
beans, and will do the churning in creameries. In
these schools boys will learn something of elec
trical engineering and the mechanism to be actuated
by electricity, so that this new labor-aiding agent
may be handled by them.
To return to conditions in this, city, for the pur
pose of emphasis. "We have here, operated in ; con
junction, the Lick and Wilmerding manual schools,
established by private endowment. % The Lick School
has-415 pupils, and for lack of facilities is compelled
to turn away more than that number who apply.
Instead of establishing the semi-penal departments
proposed by the School Superintendent, why. not de
vote what they would cost to extension of that
polytechnic school, so that its capacity would equal
the demands upon it?
If more study is given to leading the young in
line with these natural tendencies, and less to the use
of force to compel them into things that are dis
tasteful, we will be training better citizens: and if
as much attention is paid to this as is given to the
penal plan, the happy time may come when the
State schools. Â£or incorrigible youth may be turned
into polytechnic institutions, to which pupils resort
voluntarily and cheerfully for training in handicrafts
and skilled occupations. . ' ,
The policy that creates these conditions is a mis
taken one. Not every boy who goes to a trade at
the proper age makes a finished mechanic. Only
about one-tenth of all the apprentices have the qual
ity that induces them to always remain in the use
and practice of a trade. The highest purpose of
their training in the trade is to teach them industry,,
thrift, temperance and economy, the training that
makes for good citizenship, and they apply these
qualities in lines of life suited to their tastes, often
iar away from the trade in which they were acquired.
It is therefore an error to presume that apprenticeship
should be denied or so limited that the privilege is
useless, in order to malce trained men in the trades
scarce and thereby make the control of labor easier
and give it the features of a monopoly, enjoyed
mostly by aliens.
The denial or limitation of apprenticeship has
made the polytechnic school necessary, and it is well
that such institutions are increasing in number,' for
they have become the bulwark of good citizenship.
Where they are made part of the public school sys
tem of large cities the most interesting effects have
been observed. Before their establishment a per
centage of pupils, by indifference to the study of
books and a tendency to truancy, reduced the stand
ing" of all grades above the primary. Where the trade
schools are established it is observed that this class
of indifferent and truant pupils, almost without ex
ception, voluntarily enroll themselves in the "shop
school," where they at once become interested and
indutlrious workers. It will be observed that this
improves the morale of the whole School Depart
ment, reduces truancy to a minimum, raises the stand
ing of the grades affected, and is the means of
checking and effacing the tendency to idleness and
indifference.
The City Superintendent of San Francisco has re
cently proposed the establishment of truant and
parentaLschools, in which the class of pupils referred
to are to be separated and kept under conditions that,
after all. are semi-penal. In the training of the young
it is not well to classify thejp according to their faults
and shortcomings, as would be* the case in such
schools as the Superintendent proposes. It is, on the ]
other hand, far better to cause them to voluntarily
seek congenial occupation. No natural trait is more
universal than the fondness of the young for
mechanism and their desire to make something with
their hands. The boy loves his pocket-knife, and
with it whittles something into shape. It was said
that the whittling habit of the Yankee was the foun
dation of the early manufacturing supremacy of New
England, and so it was written among the classics
of the old and excellent school readers:
The Yankee boy, before he's sent to school,
Knows how to use that magic tool,
The pocket knife.
THE opening of the. new State polytechnic
school, near San Luis Obispo, is an event of
peculiar interest. ' The State can better afford
to endow such institutions than to build reform
schools for the reception of youthful incorrigibles,
under semi-penal conditions. The young need oc
cupation. They need the ordinary opportunities of
fered by the public schools as a preliminary, but
while yet in their teens they need the training of
mind and hand in some manual industry.
The restrictions upon apprenticeship and the al
most entire disappearance of the "open shop" have
had a disastrous effect '.upon our native-born yputh.
That effect is seen in the steady increase of â¢ the
semi-penal institutions in which large numbers are
restrained. While they are thus branded the. places
they should occupy under normal conditions are
filled by foreign immigration, and the country is
sacrificing the benefit it would get from the upright*
citizenship of those born on its soil and reared to
know the genius of its institutions and respect its
laws.

As a Cabinet maker Premier Balfour is anything
but a glittering success. Even his well wishers, who

The contract of the Philippine Govern
ment with the Uraga Dock Company in
Japan for the construction of five gun
boats has turned out badly. Only two of
the boats have been delivered, and the\'
failed to come up to the requirements, as
they drew more water than intended, and
their construction and workmanship were
generally defective. The Uraga builders
have be^n notified that the other three
boats will not be accepted, and that the
guarantee check for the two boats deliv
ered is forfeited. Several payments hava
already been made upon the three con
tracts now suspended, and which the
'company refuses to refund, but is said
to have made concessions satisfactory to
the Government. The Philippine Govern
ment has wasted a lot of money and
time on this transaction, which is not a Â¦
surprise to builders on this coast. The
boats could have bÂ«en built here as waa i
advocated early last year, and if too^
small for safe navigation could have been
shipped in sections to Manila for comple
tion.

A unique warship has been added as an
auxiliary to the Swedish navy. It Is
built like an iron lighter. Is about 130
feet In length, and will serve as a trans
port, carrying a military balloon* and ita
accessories, and contains the necessary
machinery for producing hydrogen and
maneuvering the balloon. The lighter is
towed by a steamer, which conveys it
from point to point wherever it may be
desired to make an ascension. The crew
consists of two officers and sixteen sail
ors. The balloon itself Is to be used for
obtaining information along the coast in
defense of the latter, and will prove a
valuable adjunct to the usual service of
security and information.
That Russia has ninety war vessels In
Asiatic waters in close proximity to Ko
rea is probably correct as to numbers
but less than one-half of this number
may be classed as fighting ships. Ac
cording to latest accounts the Russian
fleet consisted of seven battleships, three
armored cruisers, two armored gunboats
seven cruisers, eight gunboats, one tor
pedo gunboat and one sloop, a total of
twenty-nine fighting ships. To this l a to
be added about a dozen torpedo-boat de
stroyers and an unknown number of tor-Â»
pedo-boats. most of which are of little
or no value. The twelve armored vessels
and the cruisers are of new construction
but the gunboats and smaller craft are
old and have no fighting value. Japan
possesses fifteen armored ships, nineteen
cruisers, eleven gunboats, sixteen de
stroyers, seven flrst class and fifty-one
second class torpedo-Boats, a total of 119
which, with the advantage of a home base
shows that the naval strength of Russio
in Oriental waters is considerably infe
rior to that of Japan.
Two tank-steamers are being built on
the Neva for the Russian navy. They
are fitted as distilling ships to supply the
squadron with fresh water, and are to bÂ»
designated Vodolel 1 and 2 (water car
riers 1 and 2). Such vessels were first used
In the United States navy during the re
cent war with Spain. Â¦ -
The Russian r.aval programme for 1303
04 provides for the building of five battle
ships of 16,500 tons, and two battleships
on the Black Sea of 12,500 tons. The five
battleships, upon each of which $3,475,000
is to be expended during the current
year, are to have a length of 430 feet.
beam 80 feet and a mean draught of 2Â»
feet; 18-knot speed and an armament of
four 12'inch. twelve 8-inch and twenty 14
pounders. The armor belt is of 11-lnch
maximum thickness; deck, 2% Inches; gun
protection, 12 Inches to 7 inches. Tho
Black Sea battleships are to be improve
ments on the Kniaz Potemkin Tavrisch
eskl and of 18 knots speed.

Germany is turning out naval vessela
at a rapid rate, the latest being the
launch of the battleship Hessen. at Kiel.
September IS. Sho was laid down about
a year ago and is to be completed In 1304.
The Hesaen is one of four of the samo
type and general dimensions, having a
displacement of 13,000 tons. 16,000 home
power and 13 knots speed. The armament
consists of four 11-inch, fourteen 6.7-lnch.
twelve 3.4-inch and the usual complement
of small guns, besides six torpedo tubes,
five of which are under water. The esti
mated cost is about $5,7SO,000. including
armament. Two more of the same type
and displacement are to be laid down dur
ing the present year, to be completed In
1906. making a total addition to the navy
of six battleships during the next three
years.
The British armored cruiser Cumber
land. 9800 tens, built by the London and
Glasgow Company, has passed through
her trials without a hitch and consider
ably exceeded the contract requirement.
The eight-hour trial under full power
took place September 2. The ship was
down to a mean draught of 2V-" 2 feet and
fully equipped. With steam at 296 pounds
In her Belleville boilers the engines de
veloped 22,767 horsepower, or 767 horse
power over the contract, giving a speel
of 23.7 knots, an excess of .7 knots over
the calculated speed. The coal consump
tion was 2.01 pounds per horsepower.
Sheerness dockyard is to be utilized as
a special yard for reflts of torpedo ves
sels. Of late years only small craft have
been built at this yard, and no more ves
sels are to be laid down.
The shipbuilding programme of tha
British navy for 1903-4 includes forty war
vessels of all types, divided as follows:
Three battleships, four armored cruisers,
three cruisers, four scouts, fifteen de
stroyers, ten submarine boats and cna
river gunboat. No particulars of size,
speed, armament and cost of this fleet
have yet been made public, except as to
! the battleships, which are to be Improve
ments upon the five ships of the King
i Edward VII class now under construc
tion: The new ships are of 1S,<*X) tons,
nineteen knots sv>ee&, armor Kit ten
inches Krupp steel and an armament of
four 12-inch, eight 9.2-lnch and iwelve 6
inch. The corresponding particulars of
the King Edward VII are: 16.350 tons dis
placement, 1S.5 knots speed, 9-inch Krupp
armor belt and an armament of four 12
inch, four 9.2-inch and ten 6-lnch. These
new battleships, which will probably be
completed before 190S, will asaln give
Great Britain the most powerful ships
afloat, an advantage temporarily held by
the United States in the Louisiana and
Connecticut and three others now under
construction. The American ships have
reached the limit of size In a displace
ment of 16,000 tens, on a draught of 23
feet 9 inches, on -which they carry four
12-inch, eight S-inch and twelve 7-inch
guns. Their speed is calculated at IS
knots, or one knot less than the British
ships, a sacrifice necessitated on account
of the disproportionate heavy battery.
Great Britain's outlay on new construc
tion during seventeen years, from 1SS7 to
date, foots up to J506.830.000, against the
combined expenditures of France and
Russia for the same object of $505,125,000.
The several classes of vessels authorized
to be built for the British navy during this
period number 402 In all, consisting of 43
battleships, 32 armored cruisers, 13 first
class cruisers, 65 second and third class
cruisers, 18 torpedo gunboats, 123 destroy
ers, 12 scouts, 23 torpedo-boats, 22 sloops or
gunboats, 11 river gunboats and 13 sub
marine boats. Of this total number one
second-class cruiser and two destroyers
have been lost at sea.
The personnel in the British is now
more than double of what it was fifteen
years ago. In 1SSS the number was 62,400,
now It is 127,100. The highest number in
the past was 146,312 In 1810, during the
Napoleonic war. The highest figures in
the navy estimates during that war was
in 1814, when they amounted to niT,500,
000, an enormous sum for a country of
18,000,000 people. The cost of the navy
was then 16 per cent of the value of the
British sea-borne trade, and at the pres
ent time, with navy estimates of $172,
000.000, it 'is only 2 per cent of that trade.
It is true Mayor Schmitz can no longer pretend,
save by effrontery, to be the representative or even
the friend of union labor, nor indeed the friend or rep
resentative of anything beyond the Ruef machine
and the discontented masses that are willing to accept
it. His record since his election has been that of a
lightning change amateur. Hardly had he learneJ of
his election when he wrote effusive thanks, not to the
leaders of the Labor party and to the workingmen
who had been deluded into supporting him, but to
Abe Rucf and to such malcontent Republicans as
had followed Ruef. A little later he declared himself
a Republican and then almost immediately hastened
away to New York to support a Democratic candi
date for Congress.
As the intelligence of the workingmen of the city
may naturally be expected to guard them against
being deceived into supporting Schmitz and Ruef a
second time it may be assumed in some quarters that
the machine is no longer dangerous. Such assump
tions, however, must not be* blindly trusted. There
is blazing and blaring evidence all over town that
Schmitz and Ruef have money to burn in electric
lights arSi to blow to the winds through trombones
and trumpets. An element in the city that is power
ful enough to furnish so much in the way of a cam
paign fund for a discredited administration and a pair
of jack-o'-lantern politicians is an element powerful
enough to be dangerous.
A union of the conservative elements of the city is
therefore imperative, and that union to be effective
must be organized behind Henry J. Crocker. The
Democratic party is hopelessly divided. Any one
who watches the campaign can see a hundred evi
dences almost daily that the Hearst wing of the
party is going to knife Lane, partly to get him out of
politics and partly to make a showing that will seem
ingly justify their assertion that he is looked upon as
a tool of McNab, "the avowed enemy of labor," as
the Examiner styled him. The only possible way
then to defeat the Schmitz-Ruef or the "Ritz-
Schmuef combintfion is to vote for Henry J.
Crocker. That is the plain issue. Now let the people
go to it.
BY the developments of the campaigning for the
week that closed on Saturday night the domi
nant issue of the time was brought plainly
into public view. The ratification meetings of the
three parties with the speeches of the candidates for
Mayor and for other important offices outlined the
programme of each party, while the character of the
audiences assembled at the different gatherings
served to reveal the nature of the forces that are back
of each. Other events, meetings and speeches of the
week tended to further clear up the situation and re
move every confusing elejnent. We begin the second
week of the campaign therefore with an accurate con
ception of the situation. Every intelligent voter now
knows that the task imposed upon our citizenship at
this juncture is that of saving San Francisco from
the menace of class politics and from incompetent and
perhaps corrupt administration.
The lesson of the last municipal election remains
fresh in the memory of conservative men of both the
great parties and of all classes of the people. If the
conservative elements be divided we shall again see
a triumph of a faction that is ostensibly working in
the interests of a single class, but whose record in of
fice proves it to be working for^the selfish purposes
of a few individuals who are really as regardless of the
interests of the workingmen whose votes they ob
tained as they pretend to be of the interests of the
corporations they denounced. If that sort of politics is
to be rebuked, if that kind of administration is to be
discarded, there must be on the part of all citizens who
are opposed to the Schmitz-Ruef machine a har
monious movement toward the election of Mr.
Crocker and of his colleagues on the Republican
ticket.

splash reaching his feet at times, but he
seemed beyond the reach of danger.
Suddenly a giant wave approached and

when the water receded he was swept out
with it. He struggled bravely against
drowning. .He was tossed about, but the
strength of the breakers lifted him from
his feet each time he sought to gain a

attention of several people who were in
the neighborhood and two strangers went
to his assistance.

ThÂ© prosy old professor Is a scientific grent, â¢
His talk is often so abstruse his friend don't know what's meant.
If you're writing cut an ad you mustn't he like him.
But make it plain as wcrds can be and full of snap and vim.
And then besides you must be sure to put It in The Call, .
For you will nnd as others have it pays the best of all.Not wishing to take any chances, the
company decided to build the road on
Sunday, on which day an injunction could
not be secured or served. About 300 men
were employed all day in tearing up the
street, and to-night a force of over 100
men is at work. All day long Market
street has been thronged, and the great
est enthusiasm has been shown. The sen
timent of the entire city is with the build
ers of the San Jose-Los Gatos railway.
To-day's railroad building is believed to
mark an era in a greater San Jose. The
work of construction was taken up near
the City Hall Park, where work was
stopped a week ago. The pavement was
removed, ties laid on the street founda
tion and rails strung as far as Santa
Clara street before midnight to-night. A
move will probably be made by the pro
testants in court to-morrow.
On Friday the City Store, a corporation,
brought suit in tbe Superior Court to se
cure a permanent injunction against the
railway. It was alleged that the building
of the road would be detrimental to its
property. It was understood that as soon
as the work of construction was com
menced the City Store would apply for a
temporary Injunction and stop the work.
SAN JOSE, Oct. 1Lâ The San Jose-Los
Gatos Inter urban Electric Railway stole
a march on the protesting property own
ers along Market street, between San Fer
nando and Santa Clara, early this morn
ing.
About 6 o'clock Contractor G. W. Elder
and a force of 300 men appeared on the
scene and began tearing up Market street
for the roadbed of the track. This stretch
of track was needed to give the line a city
end. Never before had railroad building
been carried on in the Garden City on a
Sunday. About 300 people cheered the
railroad builders.

Popular Excursions
To the East.
There are many reasons why our
Personally Conducted excursion parties -
are so popularâ one of them is the char-
acter of our special conductor service.
Our conductors are picked men.
They must be competent and well
informed, of course, but besides that
their manner and way of taking care '
of things must be acceptable to our
patrons.
A cheery, good-natured, willing, well-'
informed conductor can add greatly to
the comfort and pleasure of the party.
Our conductors are of ' this sort.
You can rely upon that.
Kindly inquire about our Personally
Conducted parties before you make up
your mind how to go East.

In Kiatinc. China, a man was recently
executed by - being nailed to a wooden
cross. He lived three days before he suc
cumbed to his tortures.
A young man who registered at the
Grand Hotel on Saturday night as Wil
liam Jordan, South San Francisco, was
found dead in bed yesterday afternoon
with the gas turned fully on. The door,
window and transom were tightly closed.
He had been dead for some hours. The
Morgue was notified and Dej?uty Coroner
Fennell removed the body.
It was evidently a caae of deliberate
suicide. It was shortly .before midnight
that the young man entered the office of
the hotel and said he wanted a bedroom
for the night. He was assigned to one on
the top floor. He did not even have a
satchel with him and his clothing was
not by any means - costly. His manner
gave no indication that he contemplated
ending his life. -
About 1 o'clock yesterday afternon Kit
ty Cregan, a chambermaid, detected the
odor of gas coming from the young man's
room and she informed J. Ollphant, a
porter, of the fact. Ollphant forced open
the door of the bedroom -and discovered
the dead body. The room was full of gas.
When Deputy Coroner, Fennell searched
the clothing of the young man nothing
was found that would* give a clew to hi*
identity. There were two plugs of tobac
co, an election card and - an ' empty
purse. There -was not a cent of money In
the pockets, which, may. have been the
cause for the rash act. .
' ThÂ© deceased was about 27 years of age,
five feet seven inches tall and of slim
build. He had gray eyes, fine teeth, a
prominent nose and long blonde hair. His
clothing consisted of a brown sack coat
and vest, light striped trousers, tweed
cap, blue sweater with red stripes, blue
underclothing and black lace shoes.

After the installation Mayor j E. E,
Schmitz and City and County Attorney
Franklin K. Lane, who had accepted in
vitations to witness the cer*mony. were
successively introduced to the audience,
and each spoke in a complimentary strain
of the citizens of German birth or descent.
About 2000 people assembled in Eln
tracht Hall, on Twelfth street, last night
to witness the public installation of the
recently elected officers of the local
lodges of ths Order of Hermann's Sons.
The hall was tastefully decorated with
festoons of the German colors, black, red
and cold, and over the stage was a dis
play of large American flags. On ont- side
was thÂ« Stars and Stripes and on tho
other the flag of Germany. The main
floor of- the hall was fitted up as a lodge
room, and after the ofncers-elcct hud
marched Into the hall and were seated In
places assigned to them, the grand offi
cers and ex-grand presidents were an
nounced and admitted. These were Grand

form, while the' others took their re
spective positions at the lodgoroom sta
tions. After the formal opening of the
lodge the several elected officers were
Installed in an Impressive manner by the
grand president, after which the appoint
ed officers were installed by the grand
vice president. During intermissions in
the ceremony the Hermann's Sons* Glee
Club rendered several German vocal se
lections.
After the Installation the grand presi
dent delivered a short address in Ger
man, in which he reviewed the condition
of the order in this State, and announced
that at this time it is In a very prospÂ«r
ous condition, numbering a little more
than 2500, with funds in the different
lodges for the payment of sick and
funeral benefits amounting in the aggre
gate to $90,000. He also stated that during
the last nix months the Increase in mem
bership had been 165 and In finance a lit
tle in excess of $4000. After the proclama
tion of installation the lodgeroom was
dismantled, and there was a grand march,
led by John Hermann, ex-presldÂ«nt of
Eureka Lodge, and wife, after which
there was a long programme of dances,
under the floor directorship of F. W.

The Examiner is giving Its support to
the entire Democratic ticket and is seek
ing its election. Last Friday morning the
Examiner in speaking o'f District Attor
ney Byington said of him:
"He has proved himself worthy
of trust" and "he has earned a re
election." ? â¢ â¢ "Lewis F. lly-
ACCUSES BYINGTON.
Applaud, gentlemen, applaud! This is
the greatest exhibition of "lofty tum
bling" and "throwing back somersaults"
ever seen In this city.
"The continuance of the McXnb
regime means policemen on the
trucks and Gatling? gruns in the
streets ever?' time a strike Is in
progress. The Examiner -will not
he swerved from Its fidelity to the
people, who trust It and in whom It
belicvcn. It will llalit the men and
the political candidates who are
lined up with Gavin McNab."
"The Democratic ticket is headed
by Franklin It. Lane as Its candi
date for Mayor. â¢ â¢ â¢ jn r . i, nn e
Is nominated at a time when the
city needs a trained official at Its
head. ' A conspiracy Is on foot to
turn the city over to the corpora
tions and the politicians to be rob
bed. The corporations want fran
chises. The politicians -want the
plunder that can be grot by selling
franchises and collecting: toll from
-rice and crime. To prevent this plot
from being carried ont the city
needs In the Mayor's chair a man
-who has had lone political expe
rience and knows the powers of his
office. Mr. Lnne is that man, and
the people of San Francisco are for
tunate that they have the chance to
set him." .
And this is what the Examiner said of
Lane and his political associates on Sep
tember 2, last year: .;'.'"':
The Examiner knows that Gavin Mc-
Nab, "the avowed enemy of labor," se
cured the nomination of Franklin K. Lane
for Mayor, even as McNab secured for
Lane the nomination for Governor last
year.
Here is what the Examiner said of Lane
last Friday:
FLAT CONTRADICTION'.
"Mr. Lane has been for months
and is now the perxonal candidnte
of Gavin McNab. McNab Is the
avowed enemy of labor nnions. The
Examiner is the friend of organ
ized labor and therefore will not
support Mr. Franklin K. Lane if he
is nominated."
Why Is the Examiner now taking this
attitude, when it published on September
3, 1902, the following editorial:
A slight search of the flies of the Ex
aminer shows that its present political at
titude is vastly different to what it was
some time ago.
The Examiner la fflvlnpr It* sup
port to Franklin K. Lane for Mayor,
when It well knows he 1Â» the "per-
Honal choice of Gavin Me.Vab, the
avowed enemy of labor."
The Examiner In beieechlnR the
working-men and the Labor Union
Jinrty to Kapport Lnne and "vote (or
ilm, despite the fact that It ha*
many times declared that Lane Is
the choice of 3Ic\ah, and > is there
fore an enemy of labor.
The Examiner editorially asks the "peo
ple" to support every candidate on the
Democratic municipal ticket, and says
the ticket is "deserving of public confi
dence."
Step up, step up, gentlemen! In addition
to the magnificent array of freaks and
performers the Examiner throws in the
greatest and grandest "side show" ever
seen in circus events. The "side show"
is giving away "gold bricks," and it
makes no extra charge.
A THICK OF TUMBLING./
the music of Gavin McNab, the
"avowed enemy of labor," at the same
time "performing on two slack wires,"
"carrying water on both shoulders,"
"turning back somersaults" and all the
while "dazzling the eyes with astounding
acts of Jugglery."
The Examiner's circus is certainly the
most wonderful ever seen in this or any
other city. Away with your aggregation
of talent that performs In three rings!
The Examiner performs in a dozen rings
at the same time, and is the biggest

HERMANN'S SONS'
NEW OFFICIALS
NOTED PEOPLE
ON THE SIBERIA
ESbry Savage Landor,
the Famous Traveler,
a Passenger.
Among the passengers who arrived yes
terday on the liner Siberia were several
people of world-wide note. Probably the
best known was A. Henry Savage Landor,
the famous traveler and well known
writer. Landor is on his way" back to
England from the Philippines, where he
has for the last two years been gather
ing material for a book which the Har
pers have engaged him to write. During
his stay in the islands Landor \islted
many of the least heard of places, and
comes away with a high opinion of Uncle
Sam's new possessions. He was with
Captain Pershlng during that officer's
campaign- against the Moros, and speaks
in high terms of the American soldier.
The story of Landor"s journey to Thibet
is well known, and although now In good
health, the little traveler still bears traces
of the two year's illness that followed his
trying experience. Since then, however,
he has journeyed across Asia, and when,
he finishes the work upon which he is now
engaged he will cast about for new worlds
to conquer with his pen and battery of
cameras.
Another illustrious passenger was his
Excellency Major General Sir William
Gascoljme, K. C. M. G., who for the last
five years has been In command of the
British fortes at Hongkong. He has also,
during the absence of Governor Blake, as
sumed that official's duties in the British
province. The general is accompanied by
Lady Gascolgne, with whom he will make
a tour of Southern California before re
suming his journey to England.
John K. Kalanlanaole, better known as
Prince Cupid, Delegate to Congress from
Hawaii, came up on the Siberia. He was
accompanied by the Princess, who accom
panies him on his way to take up his resi
dence in Washington, D. C.
Ington has served two terms in his
present position, and no scandal
has attached to his office."
In addition to the attacks made by. the
Examiner on Byington on February 6,
1901, and on February 23, 1901, when By
ington was accused of being a party to a
plot to commit a felony and was also ac
cused of gross neglect of duty, the Exam
iner kept fast after the man it now sup
ports.
This is what the Examiner said of By
ington on April 3, 1901, in glaring head
lines:
"Bylngton is discredited and
crooked officials are given time to
reach cover. â¢ â¢ â¢ Bylnsrton a
drug- on the Grand Jury. â¢ â¢ â¢
"Christopher Dunker, foreman of
the Grand Jury, has declared that
District Attorney Bylngrton has
shown himself a friend and pro
tector of the Chinese gamblers and
refused to draw Indictments that
the Grand Jury wanted. â¢ â¢ â¢
"Christopher- Dunker, foreman of
the Grand Jury, has exposed the
efforts of District Attorney Bylnsr
ton to save a Chinese nrambler from
prison. * â¢ * lie has told how
Byingrton arsrued and pleaded be
fore the Grand Jury on behalf of
the perjured lottery dealer and at
last flatly refused to draw the in
dictment demanded almost unani
mously by the Jurors."
The Examiner then quotes an interview
with the grand juror who declared that
Byington was "standing in with the police
and the gamblers." . â¢
SEVERE CRITICISM.
The Examiner claims support for By
ington on the ground that "he has proved
himself worthy of trust and he has
earned a re-election."
Does this statement at this time coin
cide with what the Examiner said on
April 11, 1901? which was as follows:
"Wants Bylngrton to surrender his
place. - â¢ â¢ * The Grand Jury
asks the District Attorney to with
draw during- the investigation of
the Sullivan scandal. â¢ â¢ *
Grand jurors do not believe Bylngr
ton can advise them In an investi
gation of an adjunct of his of
fice. â¢ * â¢
"A crisis has been reached in
District Attorney Byingrton's rela
tions with the Grand Jury, llyinjj
ton has been requested to remain
outside the jury room daring the
hearing: of the Sullivan case. The
Grand Jury proposes to employ out
side leeal advice daring the inves
tigation of the Warrant Clerk's of
fice, whieh is under the direction of
the District Attorney."
â¢ â¢ â¢ "The trouble is the out
growth of the refusal of Byington
to accede to the Grand Jury's
wishes in regard to the Indictment
of San Jose Charlie, the Chinese
gambler, who, Byington admitted,
had sworn falsely, but whom he
wished to save from prison. At
that time the Grand Jary succeeded
by completely disregarding the Dis
trict Attorney's wishes and advice
by compelling hint to perform their
pleasure."
TELLS OF GROSS BLUNDERS.
The Examiner now says that District
Attorney Byington has "provepl himself
worthy of trust and that he has earned a
re-election."
This is what the Examiner said of By
ington on July 10, 1902:
"Byinsrton's errors make it easy
for Black. â¢ * * Blunders in the
District Attorney's office clear the
way for the dismissal of the
chargei of forgery. â¢ â¢ â¢ This
cane is so' badly tangled np that I
don't know where it stands. I
doubt if the District Attorney him
self knows just 'where the matter
is at present, and shall have to con
fess that I do not."â Police Judge
Conlan'i opinion of another of Dis
trict Attorney Byinsrton's blnnders.
â¢ â¢ â¢
"Aided by a magnlflcent series of
blnnders committed by the District
Attorney's of lice, J. II. Black, alias
J. O. Stone, has succeeded in evud
inic prosecution in this State on the
several charges of forgery filed
ngnlnat him. â¢ â¢ . â¢â¢ District At
torney Byington and hin assistants
tn this case blundered along: In
their usual happy fashion, aiding;
the prisoner in his circumvention
of the ends of justice. Every move
made in the District Attorney's of
fice was made with such masterful
stupidity that it accomplished the
unexpected result of brinclnR
Black, step by step, nearer to free
dom.. .
"The harder that Bylngton strove
In his hit-or-inlÂ»Â» fashion to render
such. interpretation of the lair as
Mould make poHftible a conviction,
the more forcibly Trail it borne in
on Black's lawyer* that if they
wanted to earn a fee tn the caae
they would have to make aonie aort
of objection . to â¢ Bylnflrton'n motion*.
lent the prisoner should be set free
before they had an v opportunity to
appear in his defense. â¢ â¢* â¢ if
Governor Gage Krants requisition
papers to the Springfield . police,
Black will be taken back there for
trial. If this Is not done he will
walk -- ont . of the City , Prison >- free,
helped along by the asnal blunder"
of a District Attorney whose efforts
on behalf of the prosecution cleared
the way to freedom."
It Says He Has Earned a Re-election in Face of Former Accusations in
Which District Attorney Is Charged With Being Incapable of Doing
Work of His Office and With Shielding Criminals From Prosecution
