on trial In Brooklyn to-day for the
murder of Captain George B. Town
send, sklnper of the lumber schooner
Charles Buckley, on November 10, the
prisoner admitted his guilt and a writ
ten confession was submitted, in which
he declared that he had shot the cap
tain deliberately and with premedita
tion because the latter owed him
money, and that he desired to facili
tate the trial because he preferred to
be executed rather than remain In prig
on. The confession further stated that
the prisoner had previously killed three
men.
SHIP'S COOK CONFESSES
MURDER OF THE SKIPPER
According to the St. Petersburg cor
respondent of the National Zcitung, in
a dispatch quoted by the Berlin cor
respondent of the Times. It is believed
in Russian official circles that a' winter
campaign In the Far East is possible.
It is the expectation in St. Petersburg
that the Question of war will be de
cided within fourteen days. Russia, it
Is added, is determined not to declare
war, in order to avoid the odium of tak
ing the initiative.
The Tokio correspondent of the Times
says that, owing to the rumors of' the
assembling of military transports at
Hiroshima, there has been a sharp fall
in market quotations on all Japanese
stocks.
LONDON, Dec; 22.â The Peking cor
respondent of the Times says a report
is current, and is believed to be true,
that Japan's request for the reconsid
eration by Russia of her reply to Ja
pan's demands was accompanied by a
specification of a time limit.
On account of the open ".hostility of
the entire Russian regime in Manchu
ria to American trade, the withdrawal
of American capital in\-ested there has
already begun. ' . . - ;
The gravity of the situation is fully
verified by the report of the Japanese
and British Ministers that Japan has
dfmanded that Russia, consider her re
ply within a limited time. The report
is generally credited. ;
PEKING, Dec. 21.â Because of the
receipt of a dispatch from the Chinese
Minister in Tokio, warning the throne
of the imminence of war between Ja
pan and Russia and urging the Dow
ager Empress to- prepare for the con
flict, a' secret meeting "of the Grand
Council has been convened. The high
est Chinese officials are greatly alarmed
and are helpless. â¢ '
Special Dispatrti to The Call.
Reports received here from both cen
ters of the Japanese-Russian contro
versy lead the officials. to conclude that
the situation, while serious, does not
involve an extension of the present
crisis. A dispatch received to-day from
Tokio frankly j sets forth the agitated
state'of Japanese public sentiment and
the Intense feeling against Russia and
foreshadows Â¦ the -possible- dispatch of
Japanese trooos to Korea; but, it Is
added, if this is done it will be with
the assent of Russria, which ..will re
lieve the expedition of, having the sig
nificance of a war move against Russia.
The official advices from St. Peters
burg continue to have a hopeful tone,
and with . advices from Tokio â¢ of . the
same tenor the authorities here assert
they have good reason to believe that
the situation, although serious, has not
reached the point of a war crisis being
imminent.- >Â¦- - Â¦'- ;
A dispatch to the Hava Agency from
Seoul, Korea, says:
"Numerous conflicts have occurred at
Chemulpo and Monsampho between
Japanese and Korean inhabitants.- The
Japanese telegraph operators have
charge of "the line from Seoul to the
coast. The possibility of Japanese
troops landing to preserve order is dis
cussed, but it would be done only with
the consent of the Russian Govern
ment."
The feeling on the Bourse torday con
tinued depressing, owing to unsatisfac
tory reports regarding the Russo-
Japanese situations. All internationals
were affected, Russian securities the
most. Toward the close a calmer feel-,
ing prevailed on the report that Japan
was seeking to transfer the negotia
tions to St. Petersburg. Industrials
shared in the depression, Rio Tintos
losing 12 francs. " V' Â¦ ;
notified China' that if she allied her
self with 'Japan pendfng. a settlement
of the Japanese-Russian controversy
France would advance in Southern
China. â¢ It is said in 'this connection that
France has not taken any steps what
ever and is not contemplating action
tn the event of a rupture between Ja
pan and Russia. On the contrary, the
official view is that France and Great
Britain" are not" likely to become in
volved'and that' Russia' and Japan will
be left: to settle- their own controversy.
Realization of the true situation, it
is said, .will not prevent General Reyes
calling upon the United States for a
reference to The Hague, of several of
the questions at issue. It is on this
point- that European diplomats have
told General Reyes that it is expecting
too "much to' ask .this Government to
pubrriit any phase of the Panama mat
ter to The Hague. Several Embassa
dors have earnestly advised the general
to ihjpress upon his people the fact
that Europe wants the isthmian canal,
and that Colombia can expect no sym
pathy friom that quarter. It has been
further pointed out by. these diplomats
that the proffered sympathy of several
South- American, republics can avail
Colombia nothing in the event of war
with the United States.
It is hoped that the receipt of this
news in Bogota will do much to" calm
the feelings there and hold the Coloni
bians in check until General Reyes can
return.
i. Great -Britain and -The Netherlands
have taken pains to let General . Reyes^
know indirectly 'tha'f Colombia reckons*
witfiout her host if she interprets "their
delay iri Â» recognizing, the republic of
Panama. as. an evidence^ of their sym
pathy for Colombia or as due, to other
than a -desire, to , protect the interests
of their financiers, who are the largest
holders of Government bonds. \*
.Official -confirmation has reached
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.â Diplomatic
pressure will be brought to bear upon
Colombia by several European powers
to prevent - war between- that- country,
and the United States. THe first step
in this direction already has been taken
by several foreign powers through
their representatives here, who have in
formed General Rafael Reyes of the fu
tility of any attempt by Colombia to
retake Panama,' declaring -that it will
result only in precipitating the Bogota
Government into war with the United
States. The result of such a catas
trophe, they* declared, Colombia herself
must realize.
If this be not sufficient, the repre
sentatives of these countries in Bogota
will be instructed, to, inform President
Marroquin that Colombia can expect no
sympathy from the European powers
in i any movement i she may. make, upon
Panama, which would inevitably fn
volvo her in war with, the United
States.
REYES FEARS AN OT7TBREAK. â¢
Thfi members of the diplomatic corps
have been informed by General Reyes
himself that he fears he can. with' difi
culty check his people much . longer.
General Reyes is not talking for publi
cation, but to several European Embas
sadors he has confided his fears with
frankness and has said he is . doing
everything in his power to prevent an
outbreak before -the conclusion of his
mission, but that, r although his .in
fluence with the army is considerable,
he is so far away that it- is difficult for
him to make this felt as strongly as if
he were on the ground and in com
mand. â¢â¢ : Â¦ 1 â¢-. Â¦ ' : ;
Diplomats whom General . Reyes has
approached on the subject, say. that
what he. most fears is the result of an
announcement in' Bogota of the failure
of. his mission. He realizes that the
most h*v can hope for from the Govern
ment of the United States -is an offer
that it\v.ill .use moral suasion to pre
vail, upon Panama to assume her por
tion of the , Colombian debt. Frequently
General' Reyes has been" told that he
can expect, nothing. .,.'.;
"I came to Washington to save what
I could from a shipwreck," he said to
a I diplomat of high rank.
CANNOT BE ARBITRATED.
t Under the impression that war is
surely to -occur between the United
States and Colombia, the quartermas
ter general of the army has been be
sieged by railroad and shipping men
desirous of transporting troops.
It was pointed out to-day that, while
the landing- of marines on foreign soil
occasions but little comment and is
only an evidence of a disturbed condi
tion of affaire, the embarkation of
troops' puts a different aspect upon the
situation: For this reason the navy
â¢will be permitted to continue to, control
affairs in isthmian waters, for the pres
ent at least, or until'matters reach a
stage necessitating the co-operation of
the army.
A long cablegram was received to-day
from Rear, Admiral Coghlan. com
manding the force at Colon, in which
he requested that crackers instead of
bread be dispatched to the Isthmus, as
the latter fowd molds quickly in the
trbpicarclimate.
Washington of the landing of Colom
bian troops on the Island of Los Pinos,
which lies close to the coast of Panama.
,Th,ese troops number eighty and they
have taken up a position on this high
island with the intention of making
paths through the Jungles.
It is safd here to be unlikely that our
naval commanders in Panama waters
will go to the extent of dislodging the
Colombian troops. On this point, how
ever, the policy of the Government has
not been definitely decided.
Rf ar Admiral Taylor, chief of the Bu
reau of Navigation and executive head
of the General Naval Board, to-day was
in conference with Captain John E.
Plllsbury, assistant chief of the bu
reau; Captain William Swift, chairman
of the general board's committee on the
fleet; Commander Winslow and Lieu
tenant Belknap of the Bureau of Navi
gation, in the secret office of the Bureau
of Navigation. Several cablegrams
which arrived from Rear Admirals
Glass and Coghlan over Sunday were
taken up for consideration and instruc
tions In reply were prepared and sub
mitted to Secretary Moody for approv
al. Nothing official regarding the con
ference was announced, except that it
concerned the isthmian situation.
COGHLAX i\SKS FOR CRACKERS.
. Coleman was made a battalion chief
last August. He won the Bennett medal
for bravery eight years ago for rescu
ing two women from a boarding-house
tire in East Tenth 'street.
Richard Joyce, a fireman, who was
appointed only ten days ago, was re
ported miss.ing after the fire was extin
guished. He was last seen in the build
ing just v before the walls fell.
After the building had been totally
destrpyed the body of Chief Coleman
was found .wedged under fallen debris
in such a position that the firemen were
unable tc reach it.
WON MEDAL FOR BRAVERY.
Father Smith, with three firemen,
turned back to the rescue and dragged
out Jones, who managed to stagger to
his feet. Jones, in pulling himself out,
'felt for Coleman. He found him so
pinned he could not rescue him, but got
his helmet, which he put on and es
caped. Within a minute the entire rear
and side walls fell.
DEATH OF CHIEF COLEMAN.
The fire,started ori.the third floor, and
when the firemen arrived the first, sec
ond'arid'third floors' were ablaze. The
third, fourth and fifth alarms^'ere sent
in in rapid succession And about tttvhour
after the fire started the 4 "two
alarm was sounded.
Battalion Chief Coleman had entered
the building with a number of men, in
cluding Lieutenant Jones and Father
Smith, the Fire Department chaplain.
They were about twenty-five feet in
side when the fire came through the
walls and the building shook. The fire
men saw the danger and dashed out.
The chaplain escaped, but a beam fell
and hit Coleman and Jones, pinning
them to the floor. . . â¢ .
. Battalion Chief Martin Coleman per
ished In the fall of two great walls of
the factory, and a fireman is missing.
There was a frightful panic among the
inmates of the swarmfng front and rear
tenements opposite, and the "firemen
and police reserves from three precincts
had the utmost difficulty In getting the
people out to the street.
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â The "two
nines" fire alarm, summoning more fire
apparatus than any. other alarm pro
vided for in the New York department,
was sounded to-night for a' fire which
destroyed the six-story factory build
ing of the Hermann Furniture and
Plumbing Cabinet Works In M.ott street
and the four-story x'arnlsh factory of
the firm, operated under the name of
the Hermann Lumber Company. A
quarter' of a million dollars' damage
was done. . . ' .â¢ .
Cool men interceded and the young
Iran was conveyed to the County Jail,
where he was protected by officers dur
ing the day. His preliminary examina
tion was held this afternoon, and he
was placed under ?20O0 bonds to await
the action of the Circuit Court. He was
unable to furnish bail and was brought
to the County Jail in this city late this
evening, where he appears downcast,
but Fays he is thankful that he escaped
thÂ«Â» wrath of the mob.
Rogoway's fathrr resides here, whore
he conducts a second-hand store. His
brother, Phil Rogoway, is a politician
In Portland. â¢
Gro*s had left tiwn before the fire,
but Rogoway was present. A number
of ci'jzens farmed a committee and
waited upon him. At first he denied any
knowledge of the affair and'maintaJned
that he was in his room asleep when
the alarm sounded. His hat, however,
was missing and he admitted that he
h2d lost it la the burning building.
A number of the business men be
came incensed at the position assumed
by Rogoway and secured a rope. A
noose was slipped around the man's
neck and the other end was tossed
over an end of a convenient telegraph
pole. "When the hemp commenced to
tighten around his throat Rogoway
collapsed and told the story. He said
that Gross was his brother-in-law, had
arranged ?or the fire and had hired him
to start it. HÂ» afterward made a con
fession in writing, as the . one made
Â¦while the rope was around his neck
would be worthless in court.
THANKFUL FOR ESCAPE.
Th*Â» blaze started in Gross & Rogo
v.ay's store, in which was a stock of
goods, mostly odds and ends, which had
been brought to Lebanon for a "closing
out." The fire was clearly of ineendiary
origin and suspicion at once pointed to
the proprietors <if this store.
SIGNS OF INCENDIARISM.
ALBANY. O%., Dec. 21.â With a rope
around his neck and a mob of enraged
citizens clamoring for his life', a young
man named Rogoway made a confes
sion of incendiarism at an early hour
this morning in the town of Lebanon,
about fourteen miles southeast of liere.
That he was not lynched was due solely
to the fact that a few cool-headed resi
dents cf the town arrived in time to
counsel observance of the law.
A disastrous fire started in Lebanon
after midnight and caused the destruc
tion of the store of Gross & Rogoway,
Smith's candy store, a saloon and a
barber shop. The loss exceeds $10,000
and there is very little insurance. By
hard work the new Lebanon hotel and
adjoining business buildings were
saved.

Mr. Cleveland in hl3 speech is ex

Not even Murphy would tell what
was to be. the keynote of Hill's address.
but the 'leader of Tammany Hall is
willing to accept Hill's suggestion as
to the feasibility of nominating a New

Murphy, and Hill have come to an un

sentiment Judge Parker -probably will
be the choice of the influential men of

Murphy had displayed skill in inducing
Cleveland and Hill to sit at the same

Murphy has been in communication

Saturday forenoon the Nanaimo po
lice received notice that some marauder
had been killing chickens by the whole
sale. These reports soon became fre
quent and all day Saturday remained
unexplained. Sunday morning the
mystery of the long series of tragedies
was cleared up by the capture of the
malefactor in the act. In Duncan
Stewart's henhouse the dog was quietly
devouring a hen.
A trail of blood leading through sev
eral streets and alleys had caused the
citizens to suppose murder had been
committed. Investigation showed the
source of the trouble. The owner of
the dog has promised to settle by pay
ing for the 103 fowls.

John Bell of Kansas City was seriously
injured. Others of the crew and almost j
every passenger on the entire train

some of them seriously. j
It â¢ was still dark when tho wreck
occurred and the utmost confusion fol- j

of the crew who had escaped injury j
were able, with the help of the pas- 1
sengers who' were unhurt, to aid the '
injured. %'4'^i'i iw* I
A wrecking crew, carrying phy- â¢
sicians. did not leave Fort Scott for
the scene until several hours after the
wreck occurred and it was 11 o'clock
before the dead and injured were
brought to Fort Scott.
John Bluebacker, the news agent,
was curled up on a seat in t!Â«e rear of
the smoker, near the stove, when the
crash came. He was taken out alive, !
but died during the afternoon. He was ';
23 years old. His parents in!

TRAINMEN* ARE KILLED.
In the crash the baggage car tele- ;
scoped the engine and landed in a corn !
field, while the smoker and the two 1
chair cars were piled in a mass on top .
of the engine. Most_of the injured were j
in the chair cars, which took fire soon j
after the wreck occurred. I
The wrecked train was one of the '
finest and fastest in th? service. It j
was made up of two baggage and mall I
cars, a smoker, chair cars and a sleeper. ]
Wtien the train reached Godfrey it was
behind time and running at full speed j
to make up time. The crew of a*<
freight train that had preceded the
Meteor Iett the switch open and the;
passenger train jumped the track 'and
rolled down an embankment. All save '
the sleeper turned over and so fast
was the train running that- tne engine
and the forward baggage car landed
nearly sixty feet off the roadbed before
they stopped. The sleeper remained â¢
upright and none of the passengers in |
this car were injured. The baggage
cars were completely wrecked and the
smoker was badly damaged. Five of
the dead were in the forward end' of
the smoker and four of th~m were I
instantly killed. ">. '
The responsibility for the wreck is
laid at the door of a brakeman of the
freight crew, who failed to flag the
passenger train. He has disappeared.
The engine of the freight had become
"dead" and the crew was ordered to re
main on the main track and turn the
switch for the passenger, then about
due. the brakeman being ordered to
flag the Meteor. This -neglected
to do.

IF N y ou are going to give HIM a smoking jacket for Christ-
mas, this is the place to' buy it. The assortment is so
extensive that you are sure to find the color you want
at the price you wish to pay.
Furthermore, the garments were made by us in our
own workshops from material purchased direct from the
weavers.. We selected only pretty patterns when we
chose the goods^and through making them ourselves we
can save you the middleman's profit, which- is from $2
to $J on a garment.
If you could have seen the crowd of women in our
store buying smoking jackets last week, you wouldn't
for a minute doubt the values we give.
The value is apparent to anybody. The jacket we
sell for $5.00 will cost at least $7.50 in any other store.
The proof is in the merchandise.
We give below a partial description of our smoking
jackets, dressing gowns and bath robes.
Any garment.can be exchanged after Christmas, but
if preferable money will be refunded.
Santa Claus is herewith gifts for the children. Any
child accompanied by an adult will be given a present.

As a matter of fact there can be no
balance on the right side of the ledger
for the last street fair, and this has
never been suspected before except by
the very few who had to do with the
n>anagement of the institution. If the
Oakland Street Fair Association Is able
to defeat the Oakland Electrical Com
pany in its suit for $4000. there will be
no balance, and if the electrical com
pany wins there* will be a deficit.
It was thought when : the fair closed
DEFICIT IS CERTAIN.
The next announcement made was
that there was trouble between the
fair association and the Oakland Elec
trical Company, of which C. F. Reuter
is the president and manager. The bill
of the Oakland Electrical Company
amounted to some $4000, and when" that
was . presented the members of the
fair association made a mo3t strenu
ous and whole-souled objection to the
amount. Director General Max L.
Schlueter of the fair association de
clared he had checked up every item
of the electrical work or the fair and
that he could only figure about $2000,
or about one-half of the amount of the
bill of the company. Upon this asser
tion the fair association refused to
pay the bill and the Oakland Electrical
Company brought suit for the full
amount. This suit is now pending in
the Superior Court of Alameda County
and the funds of the Oakland Street
Fair Association have been attached to
keep them where the electrical com
pany can get theni If .the court decides
in its favor. â¢ v'
But still no report has been rendered
of the condition of the funds of the
fair association. A meeting of the di
rectors was called for one day last week
and Secretary Dave Sinclair and Di
rector General Max L. Schlueter were
both present and ready with a lot of
figures and accounts, but the directors
were not thereto listen and so the mat
ter Is still up in the air and can hardly
be settled until after the holidays.
It was announced at the close of the
fair on July 4 last that it? would take
several weeks or months to close up
the accounts of the concern. The weeks
have rolled by and so have the months
and still the accounts of the event have
not been straightened up.
ELECTRIC EIGHT BILL $4000.
. OAKLAND, Dec. 21.â Nearly six
months have passed, but as yet no
final report has been made by the Oak
land Street Fair and Carnival Associa
tion, and the indications are that the
affairs of that organization are not as
prosperous as was at rtrst expected.
As a matter, of fact it depends upon the
"determination of a suit that is now
pending whether the association will
quit even or will. find itself $2000 short.
This condition has hardly been sus
pected by those who estimated, at the
close of the fair, that tnere would be
a balance of nearly $9000 on the right
side of the accounts.
But It Is a fact, nevertheless, that the
Oakland Street Fair and Carnival As
sociation will have to *rin the suit now
pending between the Oakland Electrical
Company and the association in order
to quit, even, and if that suit Is lost
there will be a deficit of $2000 to be met
by somebody.
The last fair was ia the hands of an
incorporated association, .while the first
one was in the hands of the Oakland
Lodge of Elks. The association was
composed almost Â¦ exclusively, of those
who were the managers of the first
fair for the Elks, and it was under
stood that the profit was to go to the
building fund of the Elks' lodge. The
officers of the association were: Di
rector General, Max L. Schlueter; presi
dent, F. P. McFeeley; vice president,
A. T. McDonousn; secretary, D. A. Sin
clair; treasurer, W. W. Landon; assist
ants to the director general C. J. Heese
man and Guy T. Smith. The manage
ment was almost exclusively in the
hands of Director General Max L.
Schlueter and Secretary D. A. Sinclair.
Stock was subscribed by the mer
chants of Oakland, with the under
standing that if there was a profit the
amount subscribed should be returned,
but since the fair there has been no
opportunity to strike a balance.
Max L. Schlueter, director general
of the Oakland Street Fair and Carrr
val Association, said to-night:
"We have held a number of meetings
since the close of the carnival, but un
til the 'suit of the Oakland' Electric
Light Company is settled we will be
unable to tell how we are going to
come out.
"As to the condition of the finances,
even with the electric company's bill
eliminated, I have not the figures at
hand and cannot tell how we stand." '
NOTHING FOR THE ELKS.
on the^Fourth of July night that there
would be something in the neighbor
hood of $9000 profit, but this profit has
dwindled until it has become a question
of a suit whether there will be an even
balance or an actual deficit.
The reasons for this are given by
some of those who had charge as the
long term of the fair, the small at
tendance and the increased expense.
The fair ran for eleven days, which is
now said to have been entirely too
long, while the attendance was (some
30,000 less than during the year pre
vious. The expenses of the fair were
greater than for the year before, and
so the event that was so largely adver
tised proved a failure.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.â Tha United
States Supreme Court to-day decided
two cas^s Involving the question as to
whether long-continued possession of
land within the Central Pacific Rail
road land grant in Utah constitutes a
valid title by virtue of the statute of
limitations. â¢ The cases were those of
the Toltec Ranch Company vs. George
Cock and others and the Toltec Ranch.
Company vs. William Babcock and
Louisa Babcock. The ranch company
claimed title under a transfer from the
railroad company, but the claim in each
case was disputed on the ploa of pos
session for. twenty or thirty years.
The Supreme Court of the State of
Utah decided In favor of the settlers
and the Supreme Court of the United
States td-day affirmed that decision.
The opinion was handed down by Jus
tice McKenna.
Witness said he had never heard tell
of Alexander Dunsmuir wanting
amusement as described by Mary
Howe, who said Dunsmulr had Induced
her and another maid to spar for hia
amusement. He al6O gave evidence
that the San Leandro property brought
in $7000 last year.
J. P. Taylor, a coal dealer of Oak
land, Cal., and friend of the late Alex
ander Dunsmuir, told of witnessing the
will in question and that during wit
ness' acquaintance with the . dead
millionaire, from 1877 to December 21,
1S99, he always found Dunsmuir intel
ligent and able to do business without
question, although he had periodical
drunks.
Witness had frequently stayed at
Dunsmuir's residence over night, and
told of conversations he had had with
Dunsmuir, particularly In regard to
procuring his marriage license. He re
cited the details of the wedding:, cor
roborating the evidence of Rev. Mr.
Shaw of Oakland in that regard. He
and Alexander Dunsmulr had one
drink of whisky, which witness poured
before the ceremony. Both were sober.
He told of huylng the bark Oriole from
Alexander Dunsmuir. He had wit
nessed the will which was drawn up
on the evening after the weddihlr and
identified his sigmature. He had been
asked then to keep the marriage quiet
by both Alexander and Mrs. Dansmuir.
VICTORIA, B. C, Dec 21.â A new
issue has been raised in the Hopper-
Dunsmulr case. When Mrs. Dunsmulr
entered the Hopper-Dunsmuir suit as
an intervener against James Dunsmulr,
her son, the defendant, in that suit, it
was understood that the will of 1899
was the only one at Issue. Now, after
the evidence of Mrs. Dunsmulr has
been put in. the defendants have raised
the Issue of a will made In 183S and Sir
Charles Tupper, counsel for Mrs. Duns
muir, has objected, as It would now be
necessary for him to call new evidence,
including witnesses as to the laws of
California. A decision will bÂ«Â» given
to-morrow whether this refeience to
the will of IS98 will be struck out or not.
Patrick Nevin, a coaenman In the
employ of Mrs. 'Dunsmuir, and now
employed by Mrs. Hopper, was cross
examined this afternoon, the plaintiff's
counsel asking questions tending to
show that he had promised to give evi
dence in their behalf, but had gone over
to the other side. He denied this and
mentioned that Mrs. Hopper owed him
$400 for several months' work.
The ret* lution is considered by many
to be a violation of the Platt amend
ment an-] it is doubtful if it will meet
with thr approval of the Senate *nd
President Palma. â¢ . .
HAVANA, Dec. 21.â By a vote of 40 to
?, and alter a prolonged discussion, the
House of Representatives to-day final
ly passed a resolution to suspend the
payment of the rentals of church build
ings occupied by the Government under
the ror.tract entered into in 1302 by
General Wood, then Governor General,
and Monsignor Sbaretti, formerly
Bishop of Havana, and recommending
an investigation as to the propriety of
the contract. Under this agreement
between General Wood and the church
authorities, 5190,000 was to be paid an
nually, for five yearg as the rental of
several buildings in Havana and else
where. During the discussion of the
resolutions the charge was made that
thf rontals were exorbitant.
SKTS ASIDE A CONTRACT.
The manner in which the succession
to the command of the army will go if
General Wood is confirmed and if
straight seniority be followed hence
forth will he: General S. M. B. Young,
the present chief of staff, until 1904;
Major General A. R. Chaff ee until April
14. 1906; Major General H. C. Corbin
until September 21, 190C; Major General
J. F. Wade until April 14, 1907; Ma
jor General Arthur MacArthur until
January, 1909; Major General Leonard
Wood until May ISO. 1924.
President Roosevelt, however, having
told the Senate that he would not again
promote' General Wood, this will leave
the command of the army to go after
General MacArthur to Brigadier Gen
eral Fred D. Grant, who in turn will be
followed by Generals J. F. Ball and
Frederick Funston.
"The charges against General Wood
were unconfirmed. They were simply
rot. Furthermore, several of us went
to see the President, and he assured us
that if we confirmed General 'Wood's
nomination he would not again pro
mote him in the way indicated, which
would block so many deserving of
ficers."
This is a very important statement
in view of the fact that one of the chief
reasons for the opposition to General
Wood has been that if he were made
major general now he would, in order
of seniority, become senior major gen
eral in 1909 and would be promoted to
lieutenant general of the army and
chief of staff until 1924, or fifteen years.
This statement by the President
means that Frederick D. Grant prob
ably will command the army in 1909.
Senator Warren said to-day:
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET, N.
W.. WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.â Senator
Warren of Wyoming, a member of the
Senate Committee on Military Affairs,
said to-day that President Roosevelt
had said that even if General Wood's
nomination as major general were con
firmed he would not again promote him
while he was President, and therefore
General Wood would not command the
army during the time Mr. Roosevelt
was in office.

No one could afford to pass by the un
derwear department without seeing thÂ«
vast assortment of rare domestic and
imported lingerie. The lovely French
hand-made sets, consisting of three un
dergarments, all. to match, are, examples
of richness and daintiness that will
please fa&tidious femininity.
Perhaps- the most prominent character
istic of the Magnin store, and the one
which Is first noted by visitors, is the
manner in which the stock is displayed.
There is very lltle of the commonplace
about it. It is unlike other stores â it Is
a women's" store â and women do like
daintiness and elegance.
Another department displays an infi
nite variety of fancy neckwear â embrac
ing many unusually attractive designs of
hand-embroidered. and real lace effects;
also a splendid line of fancy belts of the
latest- design. The 'department devoted
to eiderdown robes and sacques. blanket
robes and imported negligees and tea
gowns made of French llannel and sill:,
trimmed with real laces and handsome
ribbon effects, is important to women
who admire garments of style and com
fort.
In the children's and misses' cloak and
suit department there are hundreds of
styles of the most exclusive design,
made of such materials that are best
adapted for them. Particularly attrac
tive is an entirely new line of misses'
dresses and two-piece suits, made of
sheerest wnite materials and trimmed
with fine laces, specially appropriate for
party and festival wear. In the chil
dren's and misses' hat department one
sees the very choicest and most exclu
sive styles' of Parisian hats, caps and
bonnets â the handiwork of the most
skillful designers.
In the -rear of tho store you will see a
large department devoted exclusively to
the necessities for infants. It seems that
tit no other store is there so much atten
tion* paid to the outfitting of infants. An
other department is devoted to dresses
for -older children and suits for small
boys. " .' â¢
The window display is an index to the
interior of the store. To the right, as
you enter, you are in one of the largest
waist sections* in the West. Here one
may be shown the most exquisite waists
created, made of the very newest weaves,
colorings and textures of silk and woolen
materials, trimmed in a thousand differ
ent ways. The assortment comprises the
choicest Parisian hand-made waists.
In passing by the various stores dur
ing the holidays one sees innumerable
displays,, each commanding more or less
attention; but "one. in particular, is fas
cinating. It is the attractive store of I.
Magnin'& Co., 918-022 Market street. For
years this firm has ranked' foreniost as
leading manufacturers, importers and re
tailers of only the best grade of wearing
apparel for women and children. Mr. E.
Magnln has just returned from the fash-
Ion centers of the East, where he has
been for several weeks selecting the
choicest goods obtainable for. the holiday
t raue _his purchases embracing, ideas in
exclusive garments that will not be
found elsewhere. In addition, their Eu
ropean buyers, who are constantly
searching the markets for the best, pro
ducts of foreign skill, have contributed
largely toward the unsurpassable line of
novelties. .

PARIS. Dec. 21.â The Commissary of

the bullets fired by the Russian named

LONDON, Dec. 21.â Both the Nation
alists and- Unionists are discovering sÂ«-,
rious flaws in Irish Secretary Wynd
ham's-land act, which will necessitate
further 'amendment in Parliament.
In the Land Judges' court In Dublin
to-day, after several days' discussion.
Justice "Ross delivered judgment re
garding the sale of Lord Ely's estates,
according to which the .tenant for life
Is not entitled to appropriate the bonus
under the new aet for his own use, but
must hold It. subject to- trusts of set
tlement.
This- -important judgment, if upheld
on appeal, will prevent landlords who
are tenants for life from selling, as
they' would thereby lose the chief -in
ducement to sell under the act. The
judgment .will probably have the' effect
of all sales and negotia
tions'to sell until Parliament has tak-.m
steps to remove the doubts' and diffi
culties which have arisen In the Inter
pretation of the act.
.The postoffice officials refuse to talk
about the robbery and await the ar
rival of an Inspector. It is known that
a 'valuable registry pouch comes . to
Vallejo every evening In the 6 o'clock
mail. This pouch is said usually to
contain money and. valuables to the
value of several hundred dollars.
Naval offictrs'and others in the ser
vice who have families at. this point
use this method of sending money home
and these remittances are frequent.
The fact that this is -the holiday season
leads to the belief that contents of the
pouch were very valuable. Â»
The thieves must have been familiar
with the custom of leaving mail sacks,
arriving Sunday night, at the depot
until Monday morning. ' .
A report from Port Costa says a
number of opened letters were found
there this morning in a box car. The
thieves probably made their way to
that place in a boat and caught the
train to San Francisco.
Postoffice officials front San Francis.co
arrived here this afternoon and togeth
er with the local police are seeking the
trail of the robbers.
VALLEJO, Dec. 21.â The Southern

small amount of money was secured

There are- few theaters anywhere to
compare with the hew Tivoli in all the
modern essentials to public conveni
ence. It is big and handsome and com
fortable and as safe as strict compli
ance with the building and: fire'ordi
nances could make it. Architectural
Ingenuity and decorative art have made
it a playhouse that any city- onvearth
might Justly be proud. of, and that San
Francisco is proud of it finds Â¦ rrfahifes
tatlon every, time a loyal citizen* Is ". al
lowed to inspect its Interior^ Pride is
also reflected from every glance : east
upon, the unfinished exterior by jthe
townfolk who pass it. . .'. 'â¢:
As the exterior' speaks for;itself â or,
at least, will speak with more respect

men have finished their tasks and re
moved the . unsightly . scaffoldingâ it, Is

ENTIRELY MODERN.
When the general publicâ or as much
of it as could proceure admission tick
ets â enters the new Tivoli Opera
house to-morrow evening It will see
very little to remind it of the old Tiv
oli that for thirty consecutive years
endeavored to give what San Francisco
demanded in the way of .combined mu
sical and dramatic entertainment.
The transformation eclipses in com
pleteness anything of the kind ever
produced upon the stage of the vener
able structure that has been aban
doned. Manager Leahy told it all
when he stated that only the human
features of the old Tivoli had j been
rrfoved across the street.
Even the atmosphere is changed. The
odors inseparable 'from staleness have
given way to the more pleasant ones
pertaining to. fresh paint and upholr
stery. Sentimentalists" may grieve
when -they first miss the .hard-seated,
straight-backed chairs .in which they
sat in the old house, but such regrets
cannot- withstand the ; onslaught of
solid comfort that comes with reclining
at the proper ease angle in a seat of
padded leather and with enough space
in front to enable the legs to be ex
tended or crossed without kicking rny
thing.. It is also rnuch more agreeable
to have an unobstructed -view -of the
stage without neck-craning thanto sit
and wish mean things of the large
headed man or â blgrcolffured"' woman
whom fate has placed .in your line of
vjslon.. The oldrtimer who sits in the
new Tivoli may sigh perchance for the
old Tivoli and the' old "daysâ and more
power to him for so doingâ but it would
be unwise to bet on his willingness to
give up the new for the old.
-From the middle front of- the dress
circle Js the best place to view the
boxesan.d stage. The great proscenium
arch, brilliant with its many electric
lights, rich in gold and artistic decora
tions, encircling, the stage opening and
flaring out to sides and ceiling to the
very center of the house, some 30 feet
In'- depth... with its open ornate boxes
gracefully stepping from line of balcony
to stage level, and with its " further
magnificent plastic ornamental arcade
settings as background to boxes ris
ing" to the full height" of the audito
rium, is a decorative feature worthy of
note. The stage is 120 feet -in width,
68 feet in depth and 60 feet in height,
arid its construction ' is up-to-date in
every .detail. ' It is equipped, with an
asbestos curtain and a "set. of scenery
upon which the painters have been at
work for months. The electrical switch

VIEWING THE STAGE.
The theater has a clear width in
side of 124 feet and its depth from the
main entrance to the back of the stage
is 100 feet. The main floor Is level with
the street surface and through the nu
merous exits the house could be emp
tied. In a very few minutes. Unlike
most theaters, the main auditorium
opens directly upon two streetsâ MasOn
and Eddyâthrough five wide doors.
Each balcony is approached by sep
arate stairways, two . of these being
outside the theater walls and two oth
ers at opposite ends of the foyer. At
the main entrance is an elevator to
give rapid and easy access to the upper
balcony. Each floor has a separate
foyer, the main one being 12 feet In
width and 180 feet in lengthâ spacious
enough to give about 1000 people com
fortable standing room. * Beneath the
corneÂ» structure is- the gentlemen's
cafe, descended to by two wide stair
ways. ...
Â¦>' To see the entire interior in all its
beauty one must stand upon the stage.
From this viewpoint everything indi
cates most careful treatment architec
turally. The lines are so placed and
the subdivision 'of parts so arranged
as to make an effect at once ingenious
and graceful. On either side, level with
the dress circle, is the handsome group
of four boxes, with their morocco up
holstery and glistening brass work, and
extending beyond them, on tho main
floor, are four luxuriously furnished
loges, with low dividing walls of marble
topped â¢ with morocco. Each loge has
a separate dcor r from the foyer. The
two balconies sweep gracefully in per
fect [semicircle.

begin the exploitation of America the
fun is fast and furious. One humorous
situation follows another in quick suc
cession, and a big chorus of well
trained voices opens and closes each of
the three acts.
The music is of the catchy variety,
and many of the new popular songs
are effectively rendered. Miss Virginia
AInsworth, who appears in the leading
female role, made a brilliant hit with
her 'superb vdcal performances. She
possesses a voice of remarkable range
and power, i Tony West, as the long,
lean, lank Gaston, filled the bill to a
nicety, and Millar:- Bacon, as the short
partner, Alphonse, was very clever in
his vocal specialties. . The singing of
Myrtle Vane and /Lillian Levy, (he rag
time piano-playing by Elsie G. Rafael,
the drum specialty by Essie Doreen
and the fancy dancing .by Merle Bunn
and Grace Darnley, were greatly appre
ciated and enthusiastically encored.
Henry Shumer figures in the cast as a
candidate for office, passing around the
glad hand; Ernest Howell as a man of
ideas who needs only money to become
a millionaire, George Webster as an up
to-date policeman and Elmer Booth as
one whose object.in life is to put money
into circulation.
Miss Genevieve Kane has the role of
a leader of the aristocracy. Some ele
gant costumes are worn by the women
of the cast,- and the chorus girls are
strikingly graceful and pretty. "Al
phonse and Gaston" is one of the fun
niest pieces ever seen at the Central.
The actors enter, into the lively spirit

FOR THE OPENING.
President Wheeler does not believe
that McKowen will attempt to evade
the penalty for his crime by pleading
insanity or relying on some technicality
in the proceedings of the' law.
"He is not insane," said President
Wheeler.:- "That plea would not 'work
in this case. And I don't believe thirÂ«Â»
is any chance for him to take
tage of technicalities. We have* checks
in our possession that were cashed by
him. and on ,these He certafnly must
have secured the money." .. V - .'. ,
President Wheeler denies tlie .story,
that 50000 entrusted to him by '.the par
ents of Filipino children being educated
in this country .were engulfed by; Mc-
Kowen's race track operations. Luck
ily for President Wheeler this rhgney.
was safeguarded In such a way that
McKowen could not have spent it if he
would and therefore not a cent of it
has been misspent. , ?.
"That money I held In my own
name," said President Wheeler.' "It
was no matter of the university's at
all. It is true that McKowen dispensed
the money for the maintenance of these
Filipino boys, but it was done under
my direction andit was Impossible for
him to get hold of any more . money
than I was willing to give. . I have
vouchers for all . the money that was
paid out for these boys.". ;
The tormal charging of McKowen
with embezzlement . was apparently
done as a precautionary measure in
case his attorneys should attempt to
obtain his release through habeas cor
pus proceedings. It was announced
last Thursday that no formal complaint
would be filed until the bookkeeping ex
perts had concluded their task and the
exact amount of McKowen's defalca
tions was ascertained, and that Attor
ney Harry A. Wright, on behalf of the
accused, had promised to take no ac
tion to secure his client's liberty pend
ing the investigation. McKowen him
self at that time declared he had no
yearning for freedom until his case had
been disposed of by the Regents. Con
sequently, the filing of the formal com
plaint yesterday came as something of
a surprise to the miserahle prisoner.
Accountant Norman McLaren last
evening acknowledged that sufficient
evidence to convict McKowen of em
bezzlement, if he should attempt to
withdraw his confession and substitute
a defense or seek to elude justice
through a legal technicality, has al
ready been obtained from the books.
Thus far the bookkeeping experts have
devoted their efforts to getting specific
facts upon which to base a formal
prosecution, and having succeeded in
accomplishing that ' they wÂ«Jl now -go
through the books more systematically.
It is expected that their task will not
be finished until after the holidays. The
Board bf Regents will meet on January
12. by which time the finance commit
tee hopes to have all the available evi
dence to lay before them.
In speaking of the- effect which Mc-
Kowen's peculations will have on th?
finances in the hands of the university
authorities. President Wheeler said
yesterday that the scholarship funds,
so far as knojvn, still contain the origi
nal amounts subscribed by their
donor*. It is the funds provided by the
State for the maintenance of the uni
versity that have suffered, as these
were dipped into by McKowen. to make
good the deficiencies in the scholarship
funds caused by his race track plungÂ« h.
These deficiencies in the State funds, it
is supposed, were covered up by Mc-
Kowen when he charged up the money
to "expenditures."- -
McKOWEX NOT INSANE.
A CAUTIOUS MOVE.
William A. McKowen, the embezzling
secretary of the University of Califor
nia, has been formally and specifically
charged with having embezzled funds
belonging to that institution.
Complaint 'was filed against McKow
en yesterday afternoon In 'Oakland by
Norman McLaren, acting for the 1 fin
ance committee of the Board of Re
gents of the university, and a warrant
was accordingly issued by the Alameda
County District Attorney. As the ac
cused man has been in the custody of
the Sheriff ever since he confessed his
crime last Wednesday, necessity of ar
resting him was obviated. But the pros
ecution which the Regents evidently
intend to press relentlessly is formally
under way. â¢ -
The complaint accuses McKowen of
having on May 25, 1903, embezzled the
sum of $3515, which had been donated
to the anthropological department, the.
money having been paid to him and he
having appropriated it to his own use.
The name of the donor of the money
thus pilfered is withheld at his request,
but it Is known that this item Is only
one of several positive proofs of dis
honesty that have been unearthed by
Expert Accountant McLaren in his ex
amination of the secretary's books and
vouchers.
Not until yesterday did the story be- j
come known. It was alleged that the .
captain and some of the passengers J
made the statement that Second Officer i
Jones, who was oo the bridge at the (
time, was insane and steered the ship j
from her course and with the reckless- j
ness of a maniac endangered the lives |
of all on board by nearly running the ;
vessel ashore on the island. The Sher
man was headed about just in time to
avoid gning on the rocks.
Immediately after the escape from de. J
Etruction Captain Bruguiere suspended
Jones from duty and the ship proceeded !
on her voyage to Manila. She arrived '
on the return trip here several days j
ago.
F. W. Jones, against whom these j
grave charges were made, when inter
viewed last night, said that he was not
insane at the time Wake_Island was j
approached and that he was steering on i
the course laid down by Captain Bru- j
guiere. He says the captain told him â¢
fifti^en minutes before the_ ship came j
near being wrecked to log Wake Island j
as having been passed abeam, two and j
a half miles off. *
Jones' statement is as follows: "The
ihief engineer, captain and two passen
gers were on the bridge. Captain Bru- '
giere was busy conversing with them I
and gave them all of the glasses on the <
bridge, leaving none for me to see with. !
I was steering his course. At 6:30 he
thought he saw Wake Island on the j
starboard bow, and at 7 he told .me to ;
log it as .having been passed. At 7:15, !
when the land loomed up ahead, he flew j
into a rage and suspended me from !
duty, although he had fifteen minutes i
before t"ld me to log the island as
passed. I was not insane, nor did I at- !
tempt to take my own life. Had I set 'Â¦
the course and been to blame for the*
trouble I would not now be aboard the i
vessel and drawjng my pay.
"This attack on my character is felt
keenly by me, for I was not to blame. |
I have been a master and officer for I
seventeen years and have never had an I
accident. Had the captain been attend- I
inc to the laying down of hii? course j
and not allowed passengers to come on
the bridge, take ajl the glasses and oc- i
cupy all of his time, the trouble would i
never have happened."
On October IT the transport Sherman,
v. hile on her trip from Stfn Francisco to
the Philippines, came near running
ashore on Wake Island, a small piece of
land in the mid Pacific, between the
Hawaiian and the Ladrone islands.
Mercier's report, it is believed, not
only established that Dreyfus was in
nocent of writing the bordereau, but
dwelt with emphasis on the modifica
tion by Gribelin, keeper of the War
Office records, of his testimony before
the council at Rennes. Grebelin then
swore that Dreyfus was guilty, while
the modification of his testimony now
indicates that the alleged treason was
committed by Colonel Henry, who was
at the time chief of the intelligence de
partment of the Ministry of War.
PARIS, Dec. 21.â It has been learned
that at a meeting of the Dreyfus Com
mission next Wednesday Victor Mer
cler, reporter for the commission and
one of the directors of the .Ministry of
Justice, .will submit a report recom
mending revision of the case of Cap
tain Dreyfus. It is not yet positively
known whether Mercier's report will
recommend revision b;- the Court of
Cassation or by* the court-martial, but
there is every reason to believe that the
Court of Cassation will now reconsider
the case in the light of the facts gath
ered by Mercier, at the same time pass
ing upon the other documents submit
ted. â¢ â¢
While It is impossible at this stage
to predict what view will be taken by
the commission, it Is expected that it
will adopt, by at least a majority. Mer
cier's recommendation. If the revision
of the case should be favorable to Cap
tain Dreyfus he will be restored to the
army, no matter what protests may be
made, but it. is not expected that he
will assume active service.
Belief that the Southern Pacific is
taking measures to acquire the North
Shore Railroad is entertained in bank
ing circles, but many railway men hold
to a contrary view. The latter insist
that the Southern Pacific is in position
to extend its lines northward by ntfier
routes and would not care to buy the
North Shore for the purpose of widen
ing its suburban system.
Other railway men observe that the
Santa, Fe is making extensive prepara
tion to extend its system to the great
redwood forests of Northwestern Cali
fornia. They argue that the Southern
Pacific is taking measures to meet fu
ture competition on the north coast.
When John Martin, president of tha
North Shore, was in New York a few
weeks ago a well known capitalist of
fered to take a large block of the com
pany's bonds provided the negotiations
could be conducted speedily. Â»The capi
talist or agent of thÂ£ purchasing syndi
cate agreed to take the bonds at their
face value and pay accrued interest.
North Shore Railroad honrts to the
value of $1,500,000 have been deposited
with the Mercantile Trust Company of
this city. The option time limit Â«
pirÂ«?d last Saturday, but before the ex
piration the requirements of the par
chasing syndicate had been compiled
with. Intelligence derived from several
sources is to the effect that the negotia
tions for the purchase of the bonds are
being: conducted on behalf of E.
H. Harriman. A railroad man
who is familiar with thev inside
affairs ef the deal â¢ remarked yes
terday: "It isr.bvious that one of these
three companiesâ thr> Southern Pacific.
Western Pacific or Santa Feâ is inter
ested in the transaction." Positive de

WOODLAND, Dec. 21. â Arthur, the
11-year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Mose
McGrew, died under pathetic circum
stances last Saturday while on the way
from Gulnda, in Capay "galley, to the
town of Capay for medical aid.
On Thursday, December 10, the boy.
while playing with a 22-caliber rifle
near Gulnda, shot himself in the head.
A physician who was called at the
time declared that It was nothing but
a scalp wound and was not a serious
matter. The boy seemed to be improv
ing and for a few days was up and
around the house. A few days ago hl3
condition became so serious that an
other, physician was called. He found
that the skull had been fractured and
removed part of the bone. ' Saturday
morning it was decided to perform an
other operation, and the parents start
ed for Capay for that purpose. The
boy died on the road, near Tancred.

Saturday night was a warm one for

the repeated warnings of the police that
they were disturbing the p^eace and

hour G. Howado and Harty Emma, also

the Japs became abusive and were

$20 down to $5. In' addition there were

were gathered in by the police. Each
was assessed $10 or five days. In Judge

his company had a contract with the
Northern Pacific which prohibited the
railway company from receiving
freight brought in by tramp steamers.
They assert that while the company
has no exclusive contract and no
agreement beyond a division of rates
on business from the Orient, it is the
general practice of the railway com
panies in the transaction of their busi
ness to make a concession, to* estab
lished and permanent linei with a
fixed and regular schedules of sailings
and arrivals, and with advertised
routes, with dockage facilities, etc.,

WASHINGTON, Dec. 21. â Charges
having been filed with the President
affecting the moral character of Be
nito Legardo, the Secretary of War to
day transmitted by mail to the Civil
Governor of the Philippine Islands a
copy of them for his information.
These charges were contained in a
cablegram to the President from per
sons In Manila.
In. commenting on the case to-day
Secretary Root expressed the belief
that, the cablegram was sent in order
that jt might be given to the press
and thereby work irreparable injury to
the Commissioner. That men's repu
tations should be thus publicly assail
ed before they had a chance to speak,
he strongly condemned.
Legardo is one of the most prominent
men in the Philippines and War De

occasions he 'exhibited great bravery
on behalf of the United" States, when
overtures were being made to Aguin
aldo to. surrender, having gone per

LOS ANGELES.. Dec. 21.â With her
foretopsrallant mast carried away and
with every appearance of having ex
perienced disaster at sea, the large
four-masted bark La Bruyere, which
was practically given up as lost, has ar
rived at Port Los Ange!<?s with a cargo
of 1700 ions of iron from Newcastle-on-
Tyne, England, three months overdue.
The Bruyere sailed from the English
port on the 10th of last May, making
the voyage in 212 days, or a trifle over
seven months. One de&in is reported
to have occurred on the voyage and
two seamen are now laid up In the
ship's hospital.
The stories told by the, captain and
crew of the reasons for the delayed
voyage are rather mysterious and con
tradictory. The general tale given out
Is to the effect that the bark encoun
tered heavy storms and hurricanes
after being out about a hundred days,
and that the distressing weather con
tinued during the voyage. A strange
feature is that other vessels which left
England several weeks after the
Bruyere. bound for this coast, have ar
rived, discharged their cargoes and
are Ions on their homeward trip, and
none of them tell of having experi
enced any severe weather.
When the subject of mutiny was
broached Captain St. Martin had noth
ing to say, and his crew likewise re
fused lo discuss the subject.
It was Intimated at the Interior De
partment that no further arrests were
expected until about the date of the
hearing in the Benson case, which is
scheduled for the 30th inst., unless
something demanding immediate action
should be revealed" in the investigation
of "the land office records now In pro
gress in connection^ with the cases in
the West.
The sjtatus of Woodford D. Harlan. a
clerk in the land office and until about
a year ago chief of the special service
division, in view of his alleged receipt
of moneys Benson is accused of having
paid to influence action on pending
matters and in view of the fact that
he is still on the rolls, has caused con
siderable speculation. Leading officials
refuse to* say what information Is ex
pected to be obtained from Harlan.
The Interior Department to-day re
ceived a dispatch from Inspector Green
at Portland, Or., saying that Albert
Harrington of Falls City, Or., had been
held under $1000 bond for impersonat
ing assistants to Special Agents Pat
terson and Hobbs, who have been in
vestigating land frauds.
The great bulk of the land frauds
which have been brought to light are
under what is known as the lieu land
selection law. A large number of en
tries filed under that law are being
withheld from final action, and all in
which John A. Benson, the San Fran
cisco man recently arrested here, was
interested have been suspended. .
Secretary Hitchcock to-day sent for
Assistant Attorney Pugh, who has been
on the Pacific Coast investigating the
frauds, and conferred with him regard
ing the situation. Hitchcock said there
had been no developments In the work.
ARRESTS TO BE MADE SOOX.
HARRINGTON* UNDER BOND.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 21.â The Secre
tary of the Interior has revoked the or
der under which final action on the en
tries on the stone and timber act were
suspended, and all such entries, aggre
gating a large number, will now be
acted upon in the regular order by the
General Land Office. The order Involves
several hundred thousand acres of the
public domain in the West, all entries
on which have been held up because of
the big frauds perpetrated upon the
Government under the timber and
stone act. The suspension, which has
been in force many months, has served
a good purpose, and in the view of the
Interior Department has been the
means of protecting and preventing
many fraudulent entries. A rigid scru
tiny of all entries under the act will
be continued, but the revocation of the
suspension order will have the effect of
allowing all valid entries to be pat
ented.
This was the important development
to-day in the land fraud proceedings,
and indicates that the Government be
lieves that the backbone of the alleged
ring that has been speculating in and
taking unlawful means of acquiring
lands under this act has been broken.
HELENA, Mont.. Dec. 21.â The most
important witnoss the State has yet
introduced in ihe Gravelle case was put
on the stand this afternoon â Myron
Fhsr.ks, an express-man, at whose
house, in Helena. Gravelle made his
headquarters after he got out of the
rer.itcntiary. in July and during Au
gust, September and part of October.
Shanks testified that he had known
Gravelle for seven years. having
worked in the defendant's butcher shop
at Clancy at the time Gravelle was ar
rested and convicted of grand larceny.
He said Gravelle came to his* house
July 24 last, and Shanks testified that
a short time before August 23 Gravelle
told him he was the man who was do
ing the dynamiting on the Northern
Pacific, and that he expected to get
5C0.OO0 out of the railroad. The' witness
paid Gravelle to!d him he hari blown up
the bridpe at Livingston, and that he
intended to blow up that at Townsend
if the railroad did not pay up. Shanks
paid that early on the morning of Au
gust 24 Gravelle returned to his house
and told htm he had made a bull of
the Job: that he had gone to mee't the
engine with the money: that he had
fallen in a holo and his lantern, which
he was to signal with, had been broken:
that the wind was blowing and all his
matches went out. so he could not light
it apain. and he had seen the engine
with the money pull out again. The
witness said Gravelle had with him a
riflle. which he had borrowed. The
next time he set ont for the payment
of the money was September 2. and the
witness testified that Gravelle told him
that nitjht the railroad people were
'ate, and when he was about a mile
away, after waiting two hours, he saw
the engine pa<=s by. The witness s?M he
paw Gravelle writing in his barn a let
ter addressed to J. M. Hanford. and
also testified that he had mailed two
k-tters for Gravelle. one addressed to
Vice President Blabon of the Great
Northern. The witness also detailed a
stnry he said Gravelle told him about
his dynamiting of the streetcar track
in Butte. The defendant told him he
pot on the wrong track. The witness
said Gravelle told him on several occa
sions if he told on him he would settle
him. According to the witness Gra
velle asked him if he would take $23.
000 or ?30.000 East, after the railroad
had paid, and get it chanced into other
bills.
Elliott was an earnest champion of
this measure and appeared before the
Committee on Ways and Means during
the last Congress in advocacy of its
passage, and he has again urged it be
fore the Committee on Territory.
In the event that effectual regulations
for preserving the Alaska seal lierd
could not be agreed on. the Secretary
of the Treasury was authorized to kill
every fur seal of the Priblioff Islands
except 10,000 females and 1000 males.
This measure empowered the Presi
dent of the United States to conclude
negotiations with the Government of
Great Britain for a review of conditions
of affairs relating to the protection of
fur bearing animals in the Bering Sea
country, to determine what further reg
ulations shall be ordered if any can be
devised, to restore the industry, and,
pending the investigation and review,
authorized the President to conclude a
modus Vivendi with Great Britain
whereby the killing of any or all fur
bearing animals on the land or sea by
subjects of the respective governments
should be entirely prohibited, except the
few hundred young male seals needed
by. the natives of the islands at St. Paul
and St. George for food.
WASHINGTON. Dec. :i.â Henry W.
Elliott of Cleveland, who for many
years has been interested in the 'fur
seals of Alaska, recently has teen called
to Washington by members of the Sen
ate Committee on Territories. Four
members of this committee â Senators
lMllingham, Burnham. Nelson and Pat
terson â visited Alaska last summer and
investigated the seal islands and fur in
dustry. The report which the commit
tee will submit soon after the assem
bling "of Congress will devote much at

MYSTERY OF THE VOYAGE
DEFENDANT'S CASE IS BAD
SECRETARY ROOT ANGERED
WILL REVIVE OLD BILL
Mrs. Came Brown, who lives on
Eddy street, between Larkin and Hyde,
was the proud possessor of a diairond
ring Saturday night which she valued
at $140. In the wee hours of Sunday
morning she discovered that the bauble
had disappeared. ' Following up her
tangled train of thought from the night
before she concluded that Edward
Gallberth, an actor without an act, had
abstracted it from her finger. Accord
ingly she had a warrant issued for his
arrest. The case was heard before
Judge Cabaniss yesterday. The com
plaining witness frankly told of a Sat
urday night spent among the wine
cups. Gallberth played the' piano
while she and two woman companions
indulged in wassail in a Market-street
resort.
Then they adjourned to a hotel
across the way in search of a friend.
The friend was "sporting the oak." but
Colonel Currier, an employe of the
Mint and generally a good fellow, who
roomed across the hall, -was more hos
pitable. H'j gave the merry party ac
cess to his room and tumbled into bed.
While they chatted the complaining
witness testified that Gailberth slipped
her ring from her finger. At the time,
she said, she thought it was done for
her own protection, but later she con
cluded that the act was committed for
the sole benefit and profit of Gailberth.
When she reached her lodgings she
summoned the assistance of Policeman
Hutchings and they repaired to the
room of GaSlberth, who denied that he
had possessed himself of the ring.
"What was the value of the ring?"
queried Judge Cabaniss in his usual
dulcet tones. "Well, I paid 5170 for.it
originally. I put it In pawn once and
the pawnbroker readily gave me $60
on it." "When your uncle gives you
$60 on a ring." supplemented the Judge,
"it is certainly worth $100." "Your
Honor knov/s something about the
business yourself," remarked Mrs.
Brown. The courtroom tittered and
even the Judge broke into a laugh. '"I
have not been up against them yet, but
if Christmas came twice a year I sup
pose my shirt studs would pass into
their custody temporarily."
Mrs. Brown's story of the larceny
'was denied by the defendant and was
uncorroborated by any other testimony,
so the case was dismissed.
some Jimmle" admits his fault and will
appear in court Monday to prosecute.

adding a certain solemnity to' the

by a considerable majority, providing
for the disappearance of the crucifixes
and of the paintings of Christ on the
cross from all the courtrooms and tri

be regretted, for In . courts where so

Â» Just at present there is no better-missionary field for
cool-headed labor leaders, who'feel the impulse of Amer
ican citizenship first of all obligations, than Chicago. The
lawful authorities seem to have retreated or'" surren
dered, and left the field open to "such missionaries. If
the dead may not be buried, and the right to use for that
purpose private vehicles is withdrawn arbitrarily, as it
is now in 'Chicago by making such use too dangerous r to
be attempted, and if there be a force strong enough to
IT would seem as if industrial war has reached its
acute stage in Chicago, where the removal of the
bodies of the dead from the homes of bereaved peo
ple is forbidden and their burial prevented by the strik
ers. The Board of Health has suspended its interment
regulations and forbidden the publication of deaths, be
cause the house of the dead is at once surrounded by
pickets, who deny the right of ingress and egress. When
armies are in battle they^make truce to bury the dead,
but in this great city of the United States there is no
truce, and the dead must life where the breath left them.
Such incidents cause grave doubts of the "supremacy
of the law and of its capacity to protect individual rights.
A new issue entirely is raised, that has no right relation
to labor questions. It is entirely, an issue between law
and lawlessness, between the enjoyment of the' most
primitive and necessary of personal rights and their ar
bitrary denial.

PATCHESâ Subscriber. San Jose,
Cal. The custom of ladles wearing
black patches of gummed taffeta on the
face with the idea of heightnlnÂ£ the
brilliancy of their complexion dates
back in England to 1653. In "Artificial
Changeling," published at that time, a
writer contributes the following: "Our
ladies have lately entertained a vain
custom of spotting their faces, out of
an affectation of a mole, to set off their
beauty, such ar Venus had: and It Is
well, If one black patch will serve to
make their faces remarkable, for some
fill their visages full of them, varied
into all manners of shapes." The fash
ion of wearing patches on the face was
common with Roman dames \n the lat
ter days of the empire. ' i.i\'
"My rank, as your Majesty knows,
is that of Eeneral," protested the no
bleman. >
"Then I make him a general, too, and
thus the beating you are to get will
come from a man of your own rank."
The noble now took his punishment
philosophically. As for the young sol
dier, he was next day commissioned a
general and made a Count. From him
the present family of the Tolstois is
said to be descended. â Boston Post.
The Russian family of the Tolstois,
to which the great novelist belopgs,
owes its rise, according to one of the
pilgrims to Isnaya Polyana, to a cu
rious episode. The founder of this fam
ily was. in Peter the Great's time, a
simple doorkeeper before the apart
ments of the Emperor. One day, as
he was standing at his post, a noble
man approached and asked to be ad
mitted. The doorkeeper, however, re
fused to let him in, declaring that the
Emperor had given him positive orders
that no one that afternoon was to be
admitted to his presence.
"But," said the noble, "I am the
Prince" â
"Still. I cannot admit you, sir," said
the doorkeeper. fv;: J.
Exasperated, the noble struck the
doorkeeper across the face with his
riding whip.
"Strike away, your Highness," said
the other, "but nevertheless* I cannot
let you in."
The tumult had been overheard by
the Emperor. He now opened the dooT
and asked what the trouble was. The
noble told him. He listened in silence,
and then he said:
"You, Tolstoi, was struck by this gen
tleman for obeying my orders. Here,
take my stick and strike him back."
"But, your Majesty, this man is a
common soldier." *
''Then 1 make him *<! captain," said
the Emperor.
"But I am ar. officer of your Maj
esty's household."
"I make him a colonel of my Life
Guards."
A Good Yarn.
A well known up country storekeeper
was in this city a few days purchas
ing holiday goods. While chatting in
one of the wholesale houses he told the
following story of an old attorney in
his town, who did a thriving business
as a collector of bad debts.
"About a year ago," said the mer
chant, "I told this lawyer that if he
could collect from a resident .of my
town a bill of $20 he had owed me for
several years he could have half of it.
He accepted the commission. I did not
hear from him for months, and one
day, a few weeks ago, I met the man
who owed me the money and told him
I had engaged the lawyer to collect it
from him. 'I know you have,' he re
torted, much to my surprise, 'and I
have paid him.'
"The next day I sent for the attor
ney-collector and asked him why if
Blank had paid him he had not turned
the cash over to me.
"The answer I got nearly staggered
me. 'Why,' he said, 'I was only able
to get my half out of him.* "
Collected His Fee.
In the year 1776 the first move against the trade in
human chattels was made. The place was the English
House of Commons and the men who sounded the cry
of warning were Fox, Burke and Pitt. But in England
the moral sense could not yet override vested interests;
it remained for the King of Denmark to .be the first
successful champion of the cause of humanity and in
1792 to prohibit his subjects from all dealing in the bodies
of black men. Then the British Parliament overcame
the resistance of the slave owners and in 1807 it passed
the famous act for the abolition of the slave trade.
From that date England assumed the leadership in the
opposition to the noxious traffic and never ceased until
the last of her possessions in Africa were cleared of it a
few years ago.
The story of. the bitter struggle over slavery in our.
own country is writ too large in our, history to make a
reference to it necessary. Comparatively few, however,
know that there is hardly a file of the year's correspond
ence in our Department of State from 1815 down to the
passage of the thirteenth amendment which does not con
tain 'some diplomatic negotiation with Great Britain on
the subject of the slave trade.
Upon the close of the civil war our Government united
heartily with Great Britain in the patrol of the African
coast and the slave evil began to be hunted down in its
lairs. By the partition of Africa among the * Europeaa
powers at the' Berlin conference of 1885 the slave states
of the dark continent were opened to purging. The
Brussels Congress in 1903 declared fora complete scour
ing of the whole east coast and Central Soudan, Congo
Free State, German East Africa, the French provinces
below the Sahara. Piece by piece the man hunting
dhows were forced to relinquish their territory until the
fall of 'the potentate of. Wadai marks the disappearance
of slavery from the theater of civilization!
THERE appeared in the press recently an insignifi
cant paragraph to the effect that Wadai, the last of
the independent states of Central Soudan, had
finally passed into the power of France under a pro
tectorate. This bit of news has a humanitarian interest
far greater than the trivial import that it may carry to
the diplomats, for the fall of Wadai marks the eradica
tion of the last vestiges of fhe slave trade from the con
tinent of Africa. In the year 1442 Prince Henry the
Navigator, King" of Portugal, became the first African
slave trader. In the year 1903 the submission of some
nameless dhow of the Soudan marks the passing of the
last one.

From t & prominent society leader
complaint was lodged at police head
quarters that a number of valuable
jeweled rings had been stolen. Investi
gation by detectives centered the theft
upon a young woman who was a close
friend of the loser of the gems. The
missing jewels were traced to a pawn
shop, where, it was proved, the sus
pected girl had pledged them. Thence
the fact was uncovered that the thief
had bought other jewelry with the
money received from the sale of the
rings and had sent the purchase to the
friend from whom she had stolen.
Still farther the police went and to
their astonishment uncovered the fact
that Miss Blank, the thief, was a con
firmed chloroform "fiend." Physicians
studied the case. Opinion was unani
mous that the degenerating effect of
the drug was responsible for the girl's
action. Doctors and police accepted
the facts as conclusive that a real
mania existed. Of course the disclos
ures barred prosecution.
Kleptomania as an excuse for theft
is accepted at most police headquarters
with much reservation. But once in a
while police detectives run across
cases that give such strong evidence of
abnormal mental processes that they
are set down as remarkable psycholog
ical phenomena. In point is the follow
ing:

Noticing that the gray winter unN
forms of German troops and the blue
clothing of Chinese spectators could not
be distinguished from each other at
long distances, a German officer in
China experimented on the visibility of
uniforms. A column was divided into
five sections, each with its special
clothing, and was placed in close for
mation behind bushes without foliage.
At about 1400 yards the section in gray
and that in overcoats appeared like
uniform dark posts, while the section La
khaki and that in canvas were hardly
visible. At 500 yards the gray began to
look lighter than the dark blue. The
gray overcoats, like long dark stripes,
made very good marks, but both khaki
and canvas were difficult marks at all
distances.

From a recent consular report It de
velops that the ice business in Jerusa
lem is growing. The first plant was
established at Yafa, the seaport of Je
rusalem. In 1830. but it had a rather
precarious existence until 1S99, when
there was a boom In the business, and
the plant began doing a paying busi
ness. It took nine years to acquaint
the natives with the delights of Ice, and
now it is used in all the hotels and by
the foreign residents as well as the
wealthy natives! In 1899 another plant
began operations and has since been,
successfully running in Jerusalem. The
price is 5 cents per kilogram (nearly
21-5 pounds). When the works were
first established the price was 10 cents
per kilogram. The water in Yafa
comes from wells and, owing to their
proximity to the sea, is brackish. The
Ice is never clear, and when melted
leaves considerable sediment. The wa
ter used in Jerusalem is rain water,
from cisterns, and the ice is like crys
tal. No natural ice is taken to that
country.
Ice in Jerusalem.
In the southern counties the situation appears to be
more serious'. A report from Los Angeles says: "There
have been rains in the counties both north and south of
Los Angeles, but in the belt which includes Los Angeles,
Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside the season has
been as dry as it was during the years of dought. Prac
tically no rain has fallen here since the first week in Oc
tober. There have been a few slight sprinkles, but noth
ing which wet the ground so as to make the ranchers
cease irrigating. As yet the conditions cannot be said to
be very serious except to owners of stock, but rain is
badly needed."
The tenor of the reports throughout the State is to
the effect that while more rain has been desired, the situ
ation is by no means alarming, even to those who are
most prone to look on the dark side of things and to
suffer from fears of evils that have not yet befallen them.
The season, moreover, is not yet far- advanced, and there
will 1 be time enough for abundant rains later on., In
most of our counties the spring rains count for much
more than those of the fall and early winter, so that
there is nothing" in the present shortage in some locali
ties to disturb anybody. We may confidently indeed
look forward to a year of average prosperity, and that
means a prosperity which in any other State would be
regarded as a record-breaker for abundance!
REPORTS from all parts of the State on the rain
fall of the season show that while it has not been
equal thus far to the desires of the farmers, it
has nevertheless been ample in most localities for the
needs of the time. San Francisco, with a total rainfall
this season of 6.02, as compared with 5.13 a't the cor
responding date last year, and Santa Rosa with 15.07 to
uÂ»53 l ast yea r Â» are the only points that show a heavier
rainfall this year than last. Everywhere else there has
been a shortage, but in very few places is the shortage
sufficient to occasion uneasiness.
Most of the reports are, of a satisfactory nature and
show a sanguine and hopeful spirit among the farmers.
Thus from Stockton, comes the statement that the
weather this season "has come just right for San Joaquin
County." The report goes on to say that, the rainfall
thus far has been a good average, that the ground is well
moistened, the country looks green with growing grass,
there is an abundance of food for stock, and in the or
chard and vineyard districts the work of the season is
well under way.
Sonoma has had ample rain, and reports from there
are glowing. One of them says grass is making a splen
did growth and is almost large enough to nurture stock.
Early sewn grain is doing splendidly, farmers are cal
culating on exceptionally fine grain crops from the fact
that their fields never looked more promising at this sea
son of the year. Santa Clara has had a short rainfall as
compared with last year, but there has been enough, it
seems, to keep the ground in good condition for the
fall plowing. Salinas Valley needs more rain, but a
hopeful feeling prevails and some of the weather-wise
farmers are reminding one another that the seasons in
which the rains came late have been as a rule the most
beneficial.
THE SEASON'S RAINFALL.
The great extent of this glacial move- j
ment in former times was shown by 1
the distance Â» which some of these
bowlders had been carried. Many
large masses of rock from Mont Blanc
were found more than a hundred miles j
away on the flanks of the Jura Moun- j
tains, which border the opposite side |
of the main valley of Switzerland.
Bowlders from the same region were
carried as far east as Zurich, and as
far west as Lyons in France, and are
sprinkled freely over the east coast of
England, nearly as far inland as Lon
don.
In North America the transportation
of boivlders by glacial ice has been
-ven mow remarkable. The backbone
of Cape Ood and Long Xsland, a line
of hills from one hundred to two hun
dred feet high, and two or three miles
broad, is simply a pile of bowlders and
email fragments transported from New
England and Canada. Plymouth Rock
Is a glacial bowlder which journeyed
from its' northern home thousands of
years before the Pilgrims set cut from
Holland. Bowlders from the Adiron
dack Mountains arc- found upon the
summits of the Alleghenles in North
eastern Pennsylvania. In Southern
Ohio there are long belts of Canadian
bowlders which can be traced to ledges
of rock north of Lake Huron. Even in
Boqne County. Kentucky, a fow miles
south of Cincinnati, a number of red
Jasper conglomerate bowlders, some of
them two or three feet in diameter,
have been found, which came from
w^ll-known ledges in Canada north of
Lake Huron. Bowlders'of large size
That ice in great masses could flow
like cold tar or molasses or any other
semi-fluid seemed, until a short time
ago. impossible, and did not enter into
the thought of mankind. Bjt about
f cventy years ago it was demonstrated
in Switzerland that the ice was actually
moving down the valleys, proceeding
not like an avalanche, but creeping
with a true flow and carrying on its
back and frozen into its mass frag
ments of rock of varying sizes, some of
them being as large as a small house.
Under the lee of one of th^se rock
masses on top of the Aar glacier Agas-
Fiz built him a hut and conducted many
of his most important observations.
In thinking of the glacial period it
should be kept clearly in n-md that
glacial ice is simply compressed snow.
Glaciers are formed wherever there is
a snowfall which exceeds the melting
power of the warm season. Every one
is familiar with the fact that a snow
ball may be made as hard as ice by
sufficient pressure in the hand?. Where
snow accumulates its own wright pro
duces the necessary pressure and trans
forms the lower strata into ice.
But during the glacial period proper
the ice to a depth of more than a mile
covered 4,000,000 square miles of
North America and 2,000,000 square
miles in Europe. In North America
the southern border of this ice field
extended into the ocean off the New
England const, rising like a. great ice
wall out of the water, and westward
to a line running throuph Long Island,
across New Jersey and Pennsylvania
to Salamanca, N. Y., where it turned
pouthwestward, and. with many minor
variations, reached the Ohio River
fifty or sixty miles above Cincinnati,
crossed Kentucky and Southern In
diana, reaching its farthest extent at
Carbondale, 111.; thence, bending
northwest, it crossed the Mississippi
River at St. Louis, and followed the

The story of the glacial period has
not yet been half told. Its wonders
are increasing every day. It is the
last of the great geological epochs, and
has not yet passed away. Greenland
is still shivering under the rigors of
glHcial conditions. With the excep
tion of a narrow belt of mountains
around th<* southern end, the whole
continent, some 500.000 square miles
in extent, is still buried beneath ice
from on? mile to two mile3 deep, while
the Antarctic continent, with a still
greater area, is so completely en
veloped in ice that explorers have yet

the vote of the French Chamber of
Deputies has still to be ratified by the
Senate, which, it is hoped, will with
hold the necessary approval which is
needed in order to convert It into a
law of the land."
The interesting fact has developed in connection with
the New York inquiry into the affairs of the ship-build
ing trust that the dishonest manipulators of the concern
set aside two hundred thousand dollars with which to
bribe and subsidize the French press. This appears to
be one of the very few dishonorable plans of the
schemers which did not materialize.
The California raisin retains its glucose within the
skin, where it performs its proper function in giving
character and relish to the fruit, and our raisin is the
favorite in the trade, because it is a long keeper. When
consumers discover, as they soon will,- that the'Cali
myrna fig reaches them fresh, with all its excellence upon
it, it will take the market. Our climate is entirely adapted
to the fig. The different varieties , grow all over the
State. So abundant is the crop that the purple fig is a
common food used for fattening hogs, and there is no
fresh pork finer or more wholesome than the .fig pork
of California.
The next conquest of our horticulture will be the do
mestication on the deserts of Southern California of the
highest quality of dates, the Deglet noor. This has al
ready been accomplished in a limited area in Arizona,
where the conditions are less favorable than here.
The next generation of Californians will see the mar
ket of this country supplied with California dates, of the
highest quality, and this State will then have command
of the most valuable special productions in fruit known
to the world, in table grapes,- figs, oranges, olives and
dates. What more can be desired?
Let it be remembered, too, that no other part of the
world, of similar area, produces all of these. Their pro
duction here embosses upon California the highest hor
ticultural capacity that has ever been found anywhere.
This fact cannot be too often, emphasized nor too widely
published. At St. Louis next year it will be impressed by
the presence of the actual products.

Mr. Roeding says that the white Adriatic fig may be
budded or grafted over into the Smyrna, and this being
so our progress may be more rapid than if it wait for the
propagation of new trees. The price we pay annually' for
imported figs is nearly two millions of dollars, and is in
creasing. All of this will finally come to California. Our
Calimyrna fig has the advantage of reaching the con
sumer fresh, without being filled with worms,* as is th<
'case witti'tlie imported 'fruit) which passes through many
hands, and by reason of primitive methods in drying has
its -merits as a delicious food offset by infection. It is;
destined to meet the same preference into which oun
raisins have grown. The Spanish raisin exudes its glu
cose, which crystallizes on the skin. But not being suffi
ciently saccharine to be antiseptic, this glucose molds
and destroys the raisin, making it a short keeper and bad
stock to carry.
WE desire to impress our readers with the im
portance of the statement made by Mr. Roed
ing yesterday in regard to the production of
the true Smyrna fig in .California. When Smyrna figs
were first planted in California the trees were obtained
with great difficulty, because of the indisposition of the
Greeks to permit them to be taken abroad. Some plan
tations were made by sprouting the seed of the dried
figs. When the trees grew and set their fruit it withered
and dropped without rea'ching maturity. An inquiry into
the cause of this was made by Mr. Maslin of the State
B.oard of Trade, and the discovery was made that alone
of all the fig family the Smyrna requires fertilization, and
that service is performed by a minute insect of the
wasp family, called the blastophaga.
Efforts were made then to domesticate this insect in
California, but they failed, and the effort was abandoned
until the State Board of Trade brought it to the atten
tion of Secretary of Agriculture Wilson. That gentle
man, with his usual energy, procured a scientific exami
nation of the matter, which dis'closed the fact that the
blastophaga breeds in the fruit of the wild fig, or capri,
and emerging from it, smeared with its pollen, enters the
immature Smyrna fig, fertilizes it, and breeding there
migrates again to the capri fig. Then the capri trees
were imported with the fruit on them inhabited by the
insect. Mr. Roeding took charge of them in his nursery
at Fresno, where he had an orchard of Smyrna figs. The
capri fruit passed through the winter months, and
about eight hundred figs survived up to the time of emer
gence of the insect, The Smyrna figs were then ready
and were entered and fertilized, and in due time the in
sect migrated back to the capri figs, which had then set
another crop. The problem was solved. Since then the
capri figs have flourished and the insect has increased
and seems to be entirely at home.
That first crop produced six tons of dried figs, in
1900. In 1901 the crop was twenty-five tons. In 1902 it
was thirty-eight tons, and this season it was sixty-five
tons. The fig, to distinguish it from the imported crop,
has been named the Calimyrna. As we have the Smyrna
trees now in abundance for propagation by cutting, and
the capri trees capable of multiplication by the same
process, another certainty appears in the horticultural
history of California. We are now capable of controlling
the orange, prune and raisin market of this country, and
in a few years we will control the fig market also. It
reads like a romance, 'and it is the romance of produc-
on. â¢

Although these transported bowlders
are such striking witnesses to the slow
but majestic movement of glacial ice
during the glacial period, they are by
r.o means the only ones. As the ice
slowly crept over the surface fragments
of rock became frozen into its lower
strata, and bowlders, gravel, sand and
clay were dragged along beneath it,
furrowing and scratching and polishing
the surface of the rock to an aston
ishing degree. Almost anywhere over
this glaciated area the removal of the
soil will reveal scratched and polished
rocks underneath. The direction of the
scratches and the 'grooves shows the
direction in which the ice was moving
at the time they were made. This was,
in the main, outward, toward the mar
gin of the glaciated area which we
have described, but they were many
curious variations. In Central Ohio the
direction of the glacial scratches is
southwest, whereas on the islands in
the western part of Lake Erie it is
very nearly west. At Logansport. Ind.,
extensive grooves and scratches have
been found where the movement is to
ward the north. This variation in the
direction of the grooves and scratches
indicates that there were eddies in the
ice, such as are found in the current
of a deep, slow moving stream of wa
ter. The grooves on {he islands in the
western end c-f Lake Erie are among
the most remarkable in the world. One
groove, in hard cornlferous limestone,
was about twenty feet broad and eight
feet deep, extending for a long distance
across Kelley Island. The surface of
this groove is most finely polished, cor
als and other fessils being cut off as
sharply as could be done by any grav
er's tool. The direction of these grpoves
in the bed of Lake Erie is evidently
due to the fact that the depression of
the lake a". vei ted the ice movement -in
I its closing stages in the direction of its
1 longer diameter toward the natural cmt
j let on the west.
The size of these ice-transported
bowlders is certainly surprising. Sev
eral in Switzerland which have been
moved more than 100 miles would
weigh more than 1000 tons apiece. The
celebrated Pierre-a-Bot, a bowlder
above Neufehatel, Switzerland, meas
ured 50 by 20 by 40 feet, containing
about 40,000 cubic feet, while another
near Monthey contained more than 60,
000 cubic feet. Ship Rock, near Pea
body, Mass., is a glacially transported
bowlder estimated to weigh 1100 tons,
while Mohegan Rock, in Montville,
Conn., near Norwich, would weigh 10,
000 tons. At Madison, N. H., there is a
bowlder measuring 20 by 40 by 75 feet,
which can be traced to ledges of Con
way granite, about two miles away.
The so-called Judge's Cave, or "West
Rock, near New Haven, Conn., is
formed by a transported bowlder weigh
ing 100 tons, which can be traced to
well-known dykes of trap sixteen miles
to the north. A granite bowlder near
Lebanon, Ohio, which was brought by
the ice from Canada, measured 17 by 13
feet, with eight feet out of ground, and
evidently a much larger mass under
the ground. But Professor Orton has
described a mass of Clinton limestone
in Freeport, Warren County, Ohio,
which is three-fourths of an acre in
area and sixteen feet in thickness,
which has been brought several miles.

A comparison of the expense of elections in
the larger cities of the United States places
San Francisco in the lead for economical ad
ministration under like conditions. Boston is
the .next lowest, and the per capita cost of
election of 1902 was $1 49. *
The introduction of the voting machine will
still further reduce the expense of election*
and I trust the city will havp them in opera
tion at the next general election.
Registrar Thomas J. Walsh has made
his report to the Election Commission
ers of expenses Incurred for elections
during the year 19*03. In part it is as
follows:
The crlmary election Aujruet 11. 1003, cost
approximately $<JS(K> 84, or 36 2-3c per vote
cast. Sorcial elections for improvements Sep
tember 29 and acquisition of Geary-street Rail
road October 8 cost together $19,121 CS, or
30 3-10c per vote cast. Municipal election
November 3, $61,810 28, or $1 Oi per vote
cast, a total for the four elections of $U0.
4!Â»2 80. Thia Includes registration and every
item of expense connected with the department
up to December 1. 1003.
A study of the figures given above when
compared with the cost of the department un
der the consolidation act will demonstrate the
improvement which the charter has wrought
through the operation of civil service regula
tion in the employment of clerks and the
purchase of supplies of every kind by competi
tive bidding. The first election held under the
Australian ballot law in 1892 cost this city
$29Â«,988 18. or an estimated cost per capita
vote of $3 30. Since the charter went into
effect there has been a surplus at the end of
each fiscal year, which was seldom known un
der the consolidation act.

to $100,000, with the added exDense of
putting the streets already Improved
In a like condition of improvement with
reference to grade changes, which ex
pense will be borne by the company.
The report further says that the ap
praisement of damages is accepted as
final by some property owners. It in
cludes damages to land and improve
ments and allowances for Increased
cost of grading streets not now im
proved.
The Kearny Street and North Beach
Improvement Club petitioned the board
to take steps to build the addition to
tHe Hall of Justice under the recent
bond issue.
Commissioner of Public Works ,Man
son submitted his plans for an amphi
theater on the children's playground
and they were referred to the Finance
Committee.
Stephen Potter was appointed stenog
rapher to take down and transcribe
testimony in the forthcoming annual
Investigation for the fixing of water
rates. Potter Is to receive $8 a day
and 15 cents a folio for transcribing.
Supervisor Connor gave notice that he
will move to begin the investigation
immediately after the new Board of
Supervisors is inducted into office on
January 8, 1904.
The amended ordinance regulating
the numbering of buildings so that
every one-fiftieth of a block shall be
entitled to a number Â¦ was passed to
print.
A resolution was introduced at yes
terday's meeting of the Board of Su
pervisors by Brandenstein directing the
Board of Public Works to make pro
vision hereafter (prior to the paving
or repaving of any street) for perma
nent conduits thereunder for the ac
commodation of any pipes or wires that
may be placed under the surface of the
street.
Brandenstein explained that the reso
lution was designed to prevent the con
tinual tearing up of streets by light
ing and other corporations.
Â¦ The ordinance authorizing the Elec
tion Commission to appoint a store
keeper-mechanic was passed to print.
The ordinance does not create a new
place, but simply legalizes the appoint
ment of the Incumbent of the position.
Braunhart objected to the ordinance,
saying that there are already several
temporary appointees whose appoint
ments were never legalized by ordi
nance, and a precedent would be estab
lished In legalizing the same to the ex
clusion of civil service ellgibles.
The ordinance accepting a deed for
conveyance to the city from .Charles
Patton to lands required fpr the open
ing of East Park street was passed to
print. Similar action was taken with
the ordinance accepting a deed from
E. N. Fritz to land for the opening of
De Long avenue.
Action on the ordinance ordering
street work on Ncre street, between
Elizabeth and Twenty-fourth, was
postponed for one week to hear pro
testing property owners.
F. H. Colburn appeared before the
Finance Committee and urged that an
appropriation be allowed for a munic
ipal exhibit at the St. Louis exposition.
The committee said there were no funds
available for the purpose, but an ap
propriation might be made in the next
budget. The committee then deferred
action for three weeks, when the new
Board of Supervisors will have been
installed in office.
Emma Roes, defendant in the suit for
divorce brought by Angus Ross, has
ajiswered his complaint with a denial
Mrs. Hopkins further avers that In
the month following their marriage her
husband boasted that he had won the
love of a woman named Gene Danera
and of another named Ethel, and said
that he had made a date to meet them.
He also, alleges his wife, on the same
occasion nearly broke her heart by
breaking up her Jewelry box and jew
elry and his own watch, and then
boastlngly informed her that he had
"bucked the tiger and lost $10."
Mrs. Hopkins says that it was her
husband's dally habit as soon as he
arose in the morning to pull her hair
until she puffered agonies and then
curse her and tell her that he was sorry
he ever married her. To make matters
worse, says the plaintiff, her husband
never allowed her to forget that he had
been married before, and completed her
humiliation by informing her that he
liked his first wife better than his sec
ond choice. He would also, she says,
torment her by calling her mother a
"dictator" and her sister a "big fat
slob."
PLEADS IXXOCEXCE.
Mr?. Hopkins charges her husband
with cruelty, and In support of her al
legations says that four days after
their marriage he left her and went to
Humboldt and remained there three
weeks. Upon his return, she saj-s, he
told her what a lovely time he had
flirting with numerous damsels in the
northern port, and when she cried and
objected to listening to his boasting he
threatened to leave her and go to Chi
cago,.from where, she avers, he said he
would not return if "he met any one he
liked better than her."
DESTROYED JEWELRY.
The charge of infidelity preferred in
the complaint, she states, is false in
every particular, brought for the pur
pose of saving Madden at her expense
and separating her from the child. She
says while she knew of her husband's
actions she never would have preferred
a charge against him tnat would have
injured him and told him frequently
that if he elected to commence an ac
tion for divorce on any ground that
would insure a separation without no
toriety she would have defaulted and
allowed him to have his freedom.
Pauline Hopkins, thcrugh a wife but
little over ninety days, is already
yearning for freedom. She has filed
sin action in divorce arainst John L.
Hopkins, a clerk, in which she alleges
that *ver since September 3 of this
year, the day she became his wife, she
has suffered intensely, has had fre
quent attacks of hysteria, spent many
a sleepless night and otherwise suf
fered, so that she is now a physical
and mental wreck.
In the affidavit Mrs. Madden lays all
the blame for her present unhappy pre
dicament upon Madden's parents. She
says that Fhe returned to this country
at her riband's solicitation with the
understanding that 6he was to be al
lowed, because of their unhappiness,
to secure a decree of divorce on any
pround that would not injure Madden's
came as an officer and a gentleman
or her own fair name. She says the
eubjoct of divorce had been discussed
by her and her husband after she had
discovered that he had not been faith
ful to his marriage vows. She avers
that her husband's parents interfered
and without his consent and solely for
the purpose of holding her up to ridi
cule and robbing her of her good name
instituted the proceedings.
DISLIKES NOTORIETY.
A sensational affidavit was filed in
the divorce proceedings of Captain John
A. Madden against Edith May Madden
yesterday. Mrs. Madden la the affiant.
The document V as filed with a notice
to the attorneys for Madden to the
Effect that on Friday. January 8. when
the case comes up for hearing in Judge
Hebbards court, her attt*neys would
move that it be dismissed on the sround
that the complaint was a sham, false
in fact a nd not pleaded in good faith.
Madden's attorneys are also to be noti
fied on the same occasion. In the event
that the motion to dismiss is not grant
ed, that Mrs. Madden will seek to stay
all proceedinss in the case until such
time as her husband returns to this
country, in the event of these pro
ceedings failing the affiant states that
Fhe will demur to the complaint on
the ground that it is ambiguous, de
fective, unverified and not brought at
the solicitation of the plaintiff in the
action.

"The team will play straight football.
A few tricks have been practiced and
may be used if necessary- I believe our
line will withstand the plunges of their
fast backs and our ends will not be
skirted, as Hamilton and Tarpey are
big and strong and know their posi
tions. They will break up interference
and nail the runner every time. 'Dutch'
Hobbs has taken off ten pounds during
the last week, and by Friday should
play in his old-time form. Leadbetter,
the clever Nevada quarter, will be in
the game. He will run the team and
will take orders from Geisler, who has
been selected captain. Geisler will be
behind the line and. will do the punt-
Ing. He has not an enual on the coast 4 "
Smith's confidence is ' borne out by
facts. Every afternoon , and evening
the Californians are out practicing fall
ing on the ball, tackling, interference
and all the points of the game. If the
team had another week-'s work their
chances of victory would be even great
er. In the short time they have been
playing together they have mastered
intricate plays and signals. The men
are enthusiastic in their work. No one
has suffered an injury so far, and all
will go into the game in shape to put
up a grueling contest.

harder. Our men have been going out
twice a day for practice and are round

leges will send large representations,
as their best men are on the team.
Oakland will be well represented, as
the team will play under the colors of
the Reliance Club.
There has been a great deal of curi
osity to see the-Indlans in action. The
reports of their continuous victories
have aroused a great deal of interest
in the football world. When the In
dians played here before they were ac
corded a great reception, and they will
receive Just as cordial a one this* time.
Johnson, the captain of the Indians'
team, will play quarter. He was se
lected by Walter Camp as a member
of the All-American team. He is a won
derful drop-kicker, tackles hard and
runs his men with coolness and ability.
The Eskimo center also will be an at
traction. He is the only member of his
race in the game, and he is conceded to
be a good one. He has been pitted
against the best centers of the country
and has held his own.
The Indians will arrive in this city
to-night and will register at the Occi
dental. They will loosen their muscles
to-morrow afternoon and try the
grounds. Both sides are praying for
good weather. If rain does not fall the
spectators will see a fast contest.

. Thomas Upton, a > machinist em
ployed by the Southern Pacific Com
pany, was found dead in his bedroom
at 2426 Folsom street yesterday after
noon by his wife, who had gone to>
arouse him. An open gas jet and the
odor of the deadly monoxide in the
room left no doubt as to k the cause of
death. Upton - had been drinking
heavily Sunday and owing to his quar
relsome disposition when in his cups
it became necessary 'to call in Patrol
men Douglas and Weatherford to
quiet him. About- 9 p. m. he retired
and no attempt was made to waken
him until last evening about 6 o'clock.
Mrs. Upton, upon opening ths door,
found him lying on the floor and sum
moned her son-in-law, Charles East
wood. An examination showed that
death had occurred several hours pre
viously. The Coroner was notified and
Deputy J. P. Fennel was detailed to
make an investigation.

SAN RAFAEL, Dec. 21.â The Marin
County Grand Jury, which has been
in^session here for some weeks, to-day
found an indictment against Vincent
C. Lewis, a young man from Oakland,
charging him with perjury. J
Lewis, In company with a. young
woman by the name of Sarah Hood,
also from Oakland, came to this city
on November 16, 1901, secured a mar
riage license from the County Clerk,
giving his age as 21 and that of the
young woman as 18 years.
The two then went to the office of
Judge George Rodden and were mar
ried. They immediately returned to
Oakland and the marriage was kept a
secret. After it became known that
they were k married, objections to the
bride were made and young Lewis ap
plied to the courts for relief. He sued
for annulment of the marriage on the
ground that when he was married he
was under 1 age.
The case was tried \before Judge
Melville of Oakland and the suit was
granted on the grounds set forth in
the complaint. Upon the witness stand
Lewis swore that he was under age at
the time the license was granted, aa
was also his bride. No sooner was the
marriage annulled in Oakland than
Lewis secured another license, this
time to wed a Miss McKay of San
Francisco. Judge Melville addressed
a letter to District Attorney Boyd of
this county giving the facts of the
case. Boyd lost no time In bringing it
to the attention of the Grand -Jury,
which returned an indictment this
evening.

sity of California think, and among the
hardest thinkers on the subject is Col
onel George C. Edwards, chairman of
the athletic committee at the univer
sity. In speaking about the possibility
of Heitmwller being prohibited from
playing with the All-Californians on
Christmas day Colonel Edwards said
to-day:
"There is no rule to prevent Heit
muller or any other â¢ California man
from playing with another team nor
will any attempt be made to interfere
with the game. But there is a well
defined serftiment against such playing.
If the Reliance team wants to play
Carlisle it is no affair of ours, but
they should not attempt to attract col
lege players."
Colonel Edwards was. interrogated
because there were rumors that the
committee of which he is chairman in
tended to stop Heitmuller, the only
University c-f California' man - on the
All-Californian - team, " from playing.
There were likewise rumors that the
Stanford athletic committee intended
to prevent any Stanford men from par
ticipating in the game. It seems, how
ever, that only sentiment stands In the
way, though. there is, abundant chance
that after the game the college player
may be accused of professionalism for
playing in a game where the money
will probably be divided among the
players-
University Men Object to Heitmullcr
Plnying Against Carlisle Indians.
A special oar will stop in front of
the athletic institution and carry the
members to the ocean heach. Presi
dent William Greer Harrison will walk
the^jcrowd down the beach and on the
retutn trip those who desire to take a
dip into the ocean may do so. A spe
cial cottage has been provided for
dressing purposes. / After the swim the
members will be served with an elab
orate lunch, either at the beach or in
the club's dining-room.
' Many of the members will ride to
the -beach in bicycles. There are near
ly 200 wheels in the basement of the
clubhouse and members are leaving
orders to have their bikes cleaned and
air pumped into the tires. Max Rosen
feld, captain ofthe club, has the affair
in hand and he thinks it will surpass
anything of its. kind given by the or
ganization.
Easterners can soon Judge for them
selves that in California a man can
go in swimming on Christmas day.
The Olympic Club athletes will do the
swimming and photographs of the
swimmers will be sent East by the
California Promotion Committee, with
accompanying affidavits. The club run
promises to be well attended. More
than fifty members have signed the list

QUESTION* OF SENTIMENT.
WILL SWIM IX OCEAN*
OX CHRISTMAS DAY
Training rules are being strictly fol
lowed by the men who will compose the
All-California eleven that will be pitted
against the victorious Carlisle Indians
on Christmas day. There are nearly
twenty in the squad, and the husky fel
lows are working with a vim. They
will not be satisfled by simply making
a showing against the red men. They
have set their hearts on victory, and
the Indians will have an awful tussle
to defeat them. Pete Smith, coach and
manager of the All-Californians, is de
lighted with the spirit shown by the
men. He says this augurs well for a
victory.
"The Carlisle Indians will have no
easy time next Friday," said Smith
yesterday. "The eleven that represents
this State will be one that includes
tried and true football players. Every
man has played the game for years
and has had the advantage of the
coaching, of the best experts of the
country. Not a man on our team will
weigh less than 180 pounds. This means
brawn and muscle, which, properly ap
plied, will play havoc with the Indian
line. We know we are going against
one of the foremost elevens in the coun-

Next Thursday will be a banner day
at Young Corbett's training quarters
on the ocean beach. He has issued in
vitations to newspaper men to come out
and see him weigh in. The champion
has always been satisfied that he would
make the weight, and will only weigh
himself for the purpose of satisfying
these who believe he has been shirking
his work. .'
To those who have watched the cham
pion train for 1 other contests it is ap
parent that he is rounding into mag
nificent condition. His skin is as pink
as a babe's and his breathing apparatus
could not be improved. There was a se
lect crowd at his. quarters yesterday
afternoon, and those present were
treated to some fast boxing. The "If id,"
as he is familiarly called by his trainer,
Harry Tuthill, worked nicely. He wore
three suits of underwear, had a heavy
llannel round his stomach arid had a
stove going that raised the temperature
of the room to 100 degrees. Corbett per
spired freely and seemed to enjoy his
work. He lambasted the leather sphere
until the room echoed with heavy re
ports. He hammered the bag for fifteen
minutes without a let-up, and wound
up by knocking it from its fastenings,
a la Fitzslmmons.
Then George Sanfransen, one of Tim
McGrath's finds, put on the gloves, and
he and the champion mixed things, for
three rounds. Corbett took some on the
jaw and then sailed in. He soon had
the, Klondiker bleeding from the nose
and worried. Corbett was asked to go
easy in the next round, and was obey
ing instruction's until Sanfransen tried
to knock his head off, and then the lit
tle fellow tore loose again. After three
rounds of fast work "Top Sergeant"
Otts donned his inflated chest protector,
and Willie punched it until he knocked
the wind out of it and Otts, too.
After this hard work he was rubbed
down and donned his bathing suit. He
ran to the watei*s edge and with a wild
whoop dove into an incoming breaker.
Corbett. disported himself in the icy
water until his trainers grew nervous.
When he came out he was muffled in a
dressing-robe and rushed to his quar
ters for another shower and rubdown.
The Hayes Valley Athletic Club will
hold its regular^ boxing exhibition to
night in- Mechanics' PaVilioh annex.
The main event will be a four-round go
between Joe Carroll and Paul Martin
for the feather-weight championship.
There will be five other good battles.

The padding patience of Harry
Stover's Kenilworth was finally re
warded- at I ngrleslde yesterday. The
brown 'bird." with Tommy Burns in
the saddle, was a 4 to 5 favorite for the
six-furlong handicap, even i though
asked to pick up 119 pounds. The race
was an unsatisfactory one from every
point of view, as four-horse affairs
usually are. Kenihvorth went away in
the lead, but in the stretrh was passed
by Royal Rogue, which latter horse
, seemed only to be callopir-sr. As the
wire was approached IViyal Rogue be
pan slowing down and the favorite in
a drive won by a scant length. Iridius
ran a poor third, eight lengths before
Muresca. Otto Wonderjy piloted Royal
Rogue, and as an explanation of the
peculiar showing made by the Xealon
entry, said that he lost a stirrup soon
after the start. On the way to the
post the jockey said he shortened his
stirrup and carelessly neglected to see
that it was properly buckled.
Fast time was an impossibility, as
the track was still heavy. Military
Man and Kenilworth were the only
successful fovorites, long shots almost
taking poss^-tsiim of the card.
There was quite a demonstration
when the Judges displayed the number
Â«-f Silurian first at the finish of the
mile and seventy-yard selling event.
Caronal went to the post an even
money favorite and to many of the
spectators it hx>ked as if he got up in
time to receive the decision. Xearing
the wire Silurian swerved toward the
inner rail and Caronal bore out some,
which served to complicate things. At
any rate many were displeased and
hooted the official verdict.
El Oriente looked like "oil in the can"
to win the first race, a mile selling
eventâ only for one thing. Waterbury
had the mount and succeeded in losing '
himself in the discard. Fortunately for
him. the judges were all kind-hearted.
Arthur Ray. a la to-1 chance, out
stayed Idogo. winning by nearly a
Irngth. Illilouon was third and Plan
fourth.
Charley Connell succeeded, in infusing j
some life and vim into his work, and j
put Military Man over the Tine winner j
of the two-year-old fixture. The Fer- .
pruson colt ruled favorite over Dargin
at 4 to 5. and after a mild early argu
ment with the Schreiber entry â¢was re
turned first, with pounds to spare.
Flea finished a moderate third.
Dayton & Co.'s Inspector B filly Sou
friere, a 16 to 1 shot in the betting, de
feated quite a rax** cluster of speed in
the five and a half furlong scramble. \
She had little Anderson on her back
and. nicely handled, moved up from
fourth position, disposing of Lansdowne
by three parts of a length. Reeves, the
favorite, ran a miserable race, never
being a factor. Glendenning played a
one-night stand out in front and then
finished last. Futurita opened at 3. and
around post time 10 in profusion could
be obtained.
Harry Thatcher held a celebration in
the concluding seven-furlong selection.

BERLIN, Dec. 21.â Berlin at mid

whole business of the capital was car
ried on by artificial light. The met
eorological office has not noted such
a phenomenon in a generation and^ at
tributes it to the light, motionless at

. The crack Presidio post team won the
baseball game on Sunday at San Jose
with the Mayer Bros.' team of all pro
fessionals by a score of 1 to 0. The
! game was a fine one 'all through, the
play being very fast. ? The game lasted
one hour and twenty minutes. The
post team showed up in great shape, the
entire team playing well. â¢ i
j Forsythe's* pitching was sensational.
He struck but 13 men, and only allowed
3 hits off his delivery. He was cool at
all times and never during the. game
j did he lose his control. He also figured
in a very fast double play." . The fea
tures of the game were catches by out
fields Lamb and Cusack.
Conrad did excellent work behind the
bat, and it was due to his superb
catching that Forsythe was able to do
such effective work. His" throwing to
bases was of a high order.
Manager Joe Wagner of the post
team was naturally proud of the work
of his colts. A great crowd was In at
tendance and it is very probable that
the team will play again. next Sunday
in San Jose and an excursion may be
planned to go from here for those who
want to see first-class ball played.
A report, widely circulated through-
out the Presidio yesterday that Cap
tain C. L. .Bent had been shot, proves
to be entirely without foundation. At
the time the alleged fracas was sup
posed to have taken place, Captain
Bent was at home with his family in
Alamedn. When the rumor reached
the camp of the Thirtieth Infantry it
caused a great sensation and the-ru
mor rapidly spread air over the post.
Captain Bent returned to the camp
shortly after 9 o'clock and was much
amazed when he was informed of the
report. . He stated he knew nothing
of the affair, nor how such a story
could have originated.

The Northern California Baptist
Convention, in session yesterday at the
Young Men's Christian Association
Hall, issued an invitation to the Rev.
George Robert Cairns to become con
vention evangelist. The Rev. Mr.
Cairns has just returned from England,
where his work has been pronounced

operation In the work; arrange for
union meetings of prayer and confer
ence, to be addressed by the ministers
of the various denominations, and to
carry on together aggressive Christian
work.
UKIAH, Dec. 21.â Hemby Ford, aged
fl years, was shot and seriously wound
ed by a boy companion this morning.
Russell and Hemby Ford, sons of Ar
nold Ford, a well to do hop grower of
this city, and their cousin, Floyd Bank
er, took a shotgun and started on a
hunt. The boys had been taking turns
j in carrying the gun. When the acci
j dent occurred young Banker was carry
ing the gun across his shoulders with his
j arms thrown over the weapon. In some
manner he slipped and started to fall
backward. The gun was discharged
before he touched the ground, the
charge grazing young Ford's neck and
striking underneath his jaw, tearing a
portion of it away and fracturing it in
three places. His face also was badly
injured.
Floyd Banker, in whose charge the
gun was at the time of the shooting, is
12 years old, as is the other Ford boy.
It has been reported to the jury that
checks of the union were honored at
the First National and Hibernla banks.
Treasurer Shea was ordered to produce
all of his books and records for 1903.
He will also be asked, it Is said, to tell
if he paid money or received ' orders
from the higher officials of the union
to pay money to "professional slug
gers." ;â¢â¢ â¢
GRAXD JURY' INVESTIGATION'.
The Grand Jury' to-day commenced
an investigation into the, acts of vid
lence committed during the recent city
railway strike and against non-union
men employed by the company since
the termination of the strike. A num
ber of witnesses were questioned as to
their personal knowledge, of so-called
"wrecking crews" and "educational
committees." Among these witnesses
was General Managed McCuIlough of
the City Railway Company, who said,
after leaving the jury room, that he
had testified {hat he had no personal
knowledge of specific acts of violence,
but that he had told the jury in a gen
eral way of the violence which had fol
lowed the company's attempt to move
cars with, non-union crews.
The investigation will continue to
morrow and evidence will be sought in
connection with the press feeders'
strike, which has been In progress for
several weeks. Among \he witnesses
who have been subpenaed in this con
nection are John M. Shea, treasurer of
the union; R. J. Street, cashier of the
First National Bank; John B. Clark,
president of the Kibernia Bank. These
witnesses will be questioned in an ef
fort to ascertain if money was paid to
"wrecking crews" and Â¦"professional
sluggers."
A funeral party from the Northwest
arrived in Chicago to-day, arid . after
the body of the deceased had been
taken from the Union Railway Station
in a "dead wagon" pickets .stopped an
omnibus In which the mourners were
being transferred to the Dearborn sta
tion. It was explained to the pickets
that the body was being taken south
ward and that train connections had to
be made, but they refused to allow the
omnibus to proceed until a union busi
ness agent arrived. He heard the de
tails and then declared that the mourn
ers should proceed without interference.
Plans had been made by John Curran
to have a coffin containing the body of
his wife carried on the shoulders of six
pall bearers from his home to St. Pat
rick's Church and from the latter place
to a railroad station, but in consequence
of the slippery condition of the side
walks he abandoned the idea. The
body was removed in a "dead wagon."
More than one hundred mourners, in
cluding children and babies , carried in
arms, formed in a procession and fol
lowed the undertaker's wagon in the
street.
On top of Chief O'Neil's order came
the announcement^ to-night that peace
plans looking to the settlement of the
strike had been launched. Through the
efforts of the Chicago Board of Arbitra
tion, which was largely instrumental in
the settlement of the laundry strike last
summer, a committee of four was ap
pointed at a meeting of the four livery
men and undertakers' associations to
meet with a committee of four from the
Drivers' Union and endeavor to bring
about an amicable adjustment of the
trouble.
The committee met to-night and
agreed upon a basis of arbitration. The
proposition will be submitted to a vote
of the men on both sides to morrow
and it is said that the result probably
will be an agreement to settla every
thing by arbitration.
INCIDENTS OF THE STRIKE.
While the courts havje;been inclined to
permit peaceful' . picketing. Chief
O'Neil's orders, tend' to/prohibit picket
ing of any' kirtd* around the houses of
mourning-.- He declared to-night that,
fn his opinion, no court would be found
which would fail to sustain an act of
such evident necessity and propriety as
that contemplated by the Police De
partment.
EFFORTS TOWARD PEACE.
CHICAGO, Dec. . 21.â Picketing of
houses from which funerals are to start
by the union livery drivers who went
on strike four days ago is to be pre
vented by the police, under direct or
ders issued to-night by Chjef of Police
O'Neil. J; A. Wadsworth, secretary,
and Charles Stevens, business agent of
the'Liverymen's Union, were summoned
before Chief O'Neil to-night and told in
decidedly plain language that any dif
ferences the union might have with em
plbyers would have to be settled "away
from the houses of mourning.
Chl.ef O'Neil to-night issued a general
order to all the inspectors of police. He
Instructed the commanding offices to
accompany- funerals, : If circumstances
seemed to require it, to see that the last
rites over.' the '.dead were in no way in
terfered, with. V
ROME, Dec. 21.â To-night's Osserva
i tore Romano, the Vatican organ, pub
' lishes an important document signed
by the Pope on the_ action, of the Cath
olic laity, which is said to be. rendered
necessary by the proceeding of the
recent Catholic congress at \ Bologna,
which showed such opposite tlndenctea
of the Catholic Conservatives- and the
Catholic Democrats. ' . ;
His Holiness remarks that divergent
views in field practice easily cause "di
vergencies in that theory so essential
to the strengthening of the principles
which must direct Catholic action. .. The
document quotes nineteen articles and
rules taken from the encyclicals of; the
late Pope Leo on the subject of instruc
tions to congregations, . the following
being the most important: - .
"Christian Democrats â¢ nrost entirely
abstain in Italy from participating in
any political actions, which in â¢â¢- th?
present circumstances and for reasons
of a;very high order are Interdicled.*.'
Thus the Pope destroys -all hope a M
tertained by the Liberal, elements. In
the Catholic"party* that. they would be
allowed to participate . In the political
life of the country. "'
Other important rules mentioned are
for the direction of Catholic writers-,
who must abstain from antagonizing
the \-iews of the Holy See on leading
subjects. They must sumbit all writ
ings concerning religion, Christian
morals and natural ethics to the cen
sorship of their Bishops, and they are
constrained to do this even in the case
of publications on mere technical sub
jects. In . the case of differences of
opinion* among Catholics, instead of
making these differences public In the
newspapers they must submit them to
the ecclesiastical authorities, who will
pass upon them. ,
These rules have greatly dampened
the enthusiasm of those who hoped that
the present pontificate would be more
liberal than the last one.
A meeting of the Baptist Ministers* ,,

I ELECTS OFFICERS FOR YEAR.
The following officers were elected for j
the ensuing year: Â¦ J
"This insane record of this State isap-
. palling and puts California as a State
near or at the head of the list," said
the Rev. E. R. Willis yesterday when
addressing the Methodist ministers'
meetfng at Epworth League Hall, on
"The History of Insanity and. the
Treatment of the Insane."
The Rev. Mr. Willis is pastor of the
Centenary Methodist Episcopal Church,
Napa, and takes great interest In the
welfare and care of those who are men
tally afflicted.
He gave a brief survey of the man
agement and the workings of the five
hospitals for the insane in California,
and among the causes responsible for
the large percentage of insane in the
State he declared from information he
had been given and from the results of
investigation -hat Â£he saloon is the ,
greatest source of insanity.
In the, five hospitalsâ Napa, Agnews,
Mendocino, Highlands and Stockton
there are, he said, t about 5600 insane
patients, about 3500* men arid 2100 wo
men. There were committed to the In
stitutions during the last year 1300 and
there had been 600 deaths, while 400
had been discharged as recovered. The
whole number treated during the year
was 6865.
During 1900 in New- York there was
one to 320 of the pbyulation insan?; in
Iowa the same year the records showed j
one to 667, and in California one to 281. j
Mr. Willis then turned to the nation- j
ality of the inmates, saying that all
countries of the. world were represent
ed, those showing the largest number
being: Canada, 151;' China, 304; Eng
land, 232; France, 136; Germany, 622; â¢
Ireland, 722; Italy. 130; Norway and
Sweden, 184, and Scotland, 65.
The address was listened to with deep â¢
interest and created a profound im
pression.
Rev. M. Bercowitz delivered an ad- i
dress before a meeting of the Presby- j
terian Ministers' Club yesterday, his j
subject being "Missionary Activity of

Following is the programme:
Morning, beginning at 9â Preliminary
heatp. 100 yards dash: standing broad
jump; preliminary heats, 220 yards
dash: running high Jump, final heat,
100 yards dash; pitching Sibley tent;
final heat, 2^0 yards dash; relay race.
Afternoon, beginning at 2 â Baseball
cam*'. Presidio vs. Ord Barracks (offi
cers).
Beginning to-day at the Presidio, by
order of the commanding officer.
Colonel Morris, all duties will prac
tically be suspended until January 2.
1904. excepting the necessary guard and
fatigue, as ir customary during the
holiday season.
The regular monthly field day will be
held to-day. The different events will
be of a particularly interesting nature
and will begin at 9 a. m. The Ninth
Cavalry will play an important feature
in the proceedings, and as it has been
away all summer and has had no op
portunity to take part In the preceding
events, it is expected it will add great
ly to the exercises in which }t is sched
uled to figrure.
These athletic exercises are deemed
a military duty, and failure or neglect
therein is the same as any other mili-~
tary neglect or failure. Consequently,
all those who take part enter into the
different, events with as much vigor
and earnestness as any of their other
military duties.
The booming of great cannon in the
vicinity of the Golden Gate last night
about S o clock startled many residents
of the city, to whose homes the thun
ders of the guns reached. The firing of
heavy ordnance after nightfall is an un-
UFual occurrence here, and there were
many inquiries as to what the dis
charging of the rifles meant.
Night target practice at Fort Baker
was in progress. Every vessel that
passed within ranjre of the powerful
searchlight on the bluff, looming black
above the line of churning breakers,
was made an object of assault by the
rifles. But the guns were only at play,
like sportive tigrers with claws sheathed.
No projectiles were in the shells used.
When a peaceful schooner captain,
beatinp up or down past the fort, sud
denly found himself -in the glare of the
far-reaching light and simultaneously
h^ard the bark of one of the engines of
death on the biuff, he may have had a
chill and feared some mistake had been
made as to the identity of his craft.
If so, absence of any evidence of a
projectile landing near probably reas
sured him. .". . !
Every craft that the swinging search
lipht ferreted. out on the tossing sur
face of the sea for a certain interval
was "fired" at. Fifteen shots were dis
charged in all.
Later on a target Iâ -iy be, fixed and
projectiles used.

Â¦ "A 1904 GiiT' Is one'of Bryson's last productions In pastel,
' Â¦ ' portraying a decidedly chic figure In dashing colors, effecting a
. study that has in itself a distinct character. .
This will doubtless outlive this celebrated artist's former efforts, judg-
ing by the opinions expressed by art critics, who all have agreed that It
.' â¢ is one of the finest of modern stndies from life. The picture Is panel shape
Â¦ â¢ â¢ with dark background, surrounded by an artist's sketch of the months of
the coming year, being furnished on heavy paper of the best quality, size-
. 10^x15 inches.. .. .-

, to estimate the exact number that will be necessary to supply the demand,
; and as these art supplements are manufactured for The Call by its Eastern

T. Smith, a passenger booked from
Sydney to Auckland, developed insan
ity before reaching his destination and
had to be restrained. Smith is a man
of means and companionable under
normal conditions. He appeared .all
right when he boarded the liner, *but
one night he mounted to the bridge
and told Second Officer Dawson to
change the course, as ne had orders
from Gcd to sail the Sierra to heaven.
Dawsan, thinking the man, was joking,
raid he guessed he would wait until
he got Captain HouGlette's orders.
Without warning. Smith struck the
navigator in the face, felling him to
the deck. The now ravine: maniac was
quickly seized and safely secured in
his stateroom. He' was left at Auck
land to be returned to Sydney on the
Sonoma.

H. C. McPike yesterday in the United
States Circuit Court in the case of
Evelyn J. Pierce vs. the Southern Pa
cific Company. The Jury presented a
sealed verdict in favor of the defend

$30,000 damages ' for injuries received
by Mrs. Pierce on July 11, 1300. in a
collision at Gibson's switch, Shasta
County, while she was a passenger on
a Southern Pacific Railroad train. This
was the second trial, the jury having
disagreed upon the first trial.
Mr. McPike opened the' argument on
behalf of the plaintiff and Mr. Delmas
was 4.0 . close, the court having limited
the time for the argument on both
sides. Mr. McPike became so interest
ed In the argument that when he had
concluded twenty-five minutes was all
the time remaining for Mr. Delmas,
and when Judge Hanford called "Time"
Mr. Delmas rud just got to the end of
his introductory.
Miss Kathcrine Radigan presided at

The tree was lighted with electric
plobes and the stage was ;:iled high
with toys and. presents cf all kinds.
Every child was presented with a toy
and a box of candies and the little ones
had good cause to remember lhe Yule
tide of 1902.
"Tho Birdies' Hish Tea" was a de
liphtful conception, the little children
being dressed in imitation of birds.
Â¦"The Moonbeams'* was a dainty little
operetta ar.d rvas charmingly played.
The principal number of the pro
gramme war. a drama, entitled "Heien's
Drran:." It portrayed the Irirth of
Christ as shiwn to a little sirl In a
vision as a regard for virtue und good
condact. The play was cleverly pre-
PDnted. wi;h splrndid costumes and
ringin?: and the vision of th<? birth of
the Savior was a perfect stairâ¢ picture.
Archbishop Montgomery then ad
dressed the children and guests, paying
a tribute to the Sifters of tbe Holy
Family for the good entertainment pro
vided. The Archbishop said that great
irood would result if the pirbile had an
opportunity cf seeing what the* sisters
had accomplished with the little chil
dren, especially that portion of the
public that was prone to ?pcndh:g large
ruins of money to \citne=3 doubtful
plays.

High-grade offerings of Burbanks from Sa
linas were In good request at steady rates,
while low-grade offerings, particularly river
kinds were dull. Large lines of river Bur
bankfl were being, placed . In warehouses, as
the Harbor Commissioners compelled dealers
to remove the stock from the docks within
twenty-four hours after being discharged. Sev
eral lots of poor stock .that were' not fit for
storage were sacrificed,, but sound offerings
were firmly held. The Oregon steamer ar
rived â¢ late In the day with about 1000 sacks
and .dealers -were anticipating . a. higher ' range
of prices. A carload of choice Sweets came,
and, as the market , had previousy been bare,
prices had ia . sharp advance. Onions were
firm- and some fancy . lots were held at $1 30
per cental, but no sales were reported at that
figure. Â¦ " .
Trade In Vegetables was quite active and
choice lots of Peas and Beans from Los
Angeles 'continued to bring high prices."' Re

Green Peppers and there was a sharp decline
In prices. Egg Plant was suddenly plentiful

ease of the money market at present practi
cally -llininatefl the money situation a.Â» a
factor in the dullness. The merely sentimental
effect cf the approach of the holiday* may be
reckoned to induce part of the dullness. A
rnore substantial factor In to-day's markft
was Ibe tai'iering of the war cloud in the
Far East. Brblrh took on so lowering an aspect

to be wi:Â»'out any markedly depressing effect

more active later ft in th*- situation led to
celling cf etocks In New York. The effect
here wÂ»Â» more to discourage operations In

Cnas well to the uncertainty felt as to the
effect cf war between Ru^Kla and Japan upon
our situation. Of any directly harmful re
cult* there is no amirehension. but thÂ« point
of doubt is or to how far Â«he placing of war
loans in Euror>e might dislocate the foreign

William Brennan.
Frank Howard, who was tried be
fore a jury in Judge Lawlor's court on
a charge of assault to murder and
was convicted of assault with a deadly
weapon, was sentenced yesterday to
serve, eight years in San Quentin.
There were two prior convictions
against him. one for burglary in the
second degree and the other for petty
larceny.

CHICAGO. Dec. 21.â Trading In wheat was of
a nervous character to-day. Prices showed
rapid changes. The market was Influenced by
the Eituaticn in the Far East and by conflicting
figures en the world's shipments, as well as by
the action of the leading Iong. ; There was
considerable selling at the start by email hold
ers on increased receipts In the Northwest/ The
big bull interest was also an early seller, and
prices ruled easier after a steady opening. A
good demand developed 'later from commission
houses on the strength in foreign markets, as
well as on the advances in outside domestic
markets. May eelllng up to" 83%c, after opening
H*r'.ic lower to a shade higher at > SJÂ«-4^S34c
During the latter part of the session there was
renewed selling on tfje part of the big operator,
several million bushels being reported .-taken
over by shorts. In the face of only a smaH'th-'
crease in the visible supply when a large one
was generally expected, prices sagged gradual
ly later In the day. and the low market oh May
was reached at M*iÂ©S2%c. " -The dose was at
Sl'Tkcya loss of u@% c . Clearances of wheat

The fruit market was quite active on local
account, as retailers were commencing to lay
in supplies for the extra requirements during
the holidays. The demand was confined chiefly
to fancy Apples and well-colored 1 Oranges, but
there were no changes in prices, as .supplies
of both were more than sufficient for require
ments. The market was still overloaded with
poorly colored Oranges, which moved very
slowly at unsteady rates Tangerines and
Mandarins were in good request, while Lem
ons and Grape Fruit were rather dull. A car

The Butter market opened weak, though
there was less depression than there was last
week. The feeling was weakest In the lowest
grades, which were offered very low In several
instances. The top quotation for creamery re
mained unchanged. Some dealers reported
more movement since the decline, while Qthers
were still heavily overstocked and willing to
'shade the quotations to work off their -stock.
There Is Â«ro demand from outside points at
present, and the local market has to take
care of all_the Butter that comes in.
The Cheese market Is as heavily stocked as
ever and continues weak. . *

Visible Grain Supply.
The Poultry market was liberally supplied.
Three cars of Western livestock were on
sale, and the market for local stock was easy
in consequence. Receipts. however. were
light and prices had no quotable change. Re
ceipts of dressed Turkeys were heavy and
included a car from Oregon and several cars
of Western chilled. The market was rather
unsettled, as retailers had not yet commenced
to stock up. but there was a fair inquiry and
prime stock readily commanded the top quo
tation. Most of the Western chilled was
placed in storage, but what little was on
sale sold within the quoted range." Live Tur
keys arrived freely from local points and the
West, but as the demand was steady prices
were maintained.
There were no changes In Game and re
ceipts were wall up to requirements.

Opinion Expressed That the Export
Combine Must Break.
PORTLAND, Or., l5ec. 21.â That the
combine between the lumber manufac
turers of the Pacific Coast relative to
export interests is, bound- to go . to
pieces is the expressed opinion of some
prominent millmen. They assert that
the agreements which for two years
past have held export prices up have
served their usefulness and on account
of the condition of the home market
there must of, necessity be, a disruption
of the export combine. It is alleged
that some of the mills have been guilty
of cutting prices :.nd, have continued
until the market is undermined. â¢ ;
. The looked for result is a great shak
ing up in the foreign, market that will
cause a heavy loss not only.- to : trie
mills in the combine but to those out
side of the , organization. The latter
mills would like to see the combine re
main intact; because its'agreement pro
tects, them also. A prominent lumber
man said to-day:
"I see no other possible result
a breaking up of the export combine.
At the time this organization was made
there -was a good* demand -for export
lumber and a still heavier demand upon
the home market. The latter demand
was teo great that many milfc made no
attempt whatever" to ship their pro
ducts to the foreign markets. Under
these conditions the mills that "entered
the export combine were enabled to
maintain almost any price 'that was
desired. Since then the home 'market,
has.sone.to pieces and as the foreign
market Is still good everything pos
sible has been directed In that channel.
The| result is that there has been an
overcrowding and some of the mills
have been quietly "cutting prices. This
rate cutting has been getting more bold
all the time and it has been discovered.
" '-'The r Calif ornia v people are. scrapping
about the penalty clause and other con
ditions make it almost impossible for
a settlement to be made."

of the beat informed timber and lum
ber men in the United States and with
the backing of the Weyerhaeusers he
naturally wields a strong influence.
Not long ago the Weyerhaeusers, who
have millions aC acres of timber lands
on the coast, Including the Navarro
property in the northern 'part of this
State, which they purchased a year ago
arid reorganized under the name of the
Pacific CoaBt Lumber Company, com
plained to tbe Pacific Coast Lumber
men that they were not receiving a fair
proportion of the export business and
threatened that if they were not given
a better pro rating tney would with
draw and carry on a business independ
ent of the combine, a move that would
necessitate their putting on .a number
of vessels and entering into a general
shipping business. Whether the de
mands of the firm are to be acceded
to in the- renewal of the coast agree
ment remains to be determined after
the troubles between the northern and
the California producers have been set
tled.
â¢ The committee from the north held a
short conference with the local ' ex- (
porters yesterday afternoon,, but no
progress was made toward the settle
"fhent of the existing difficulties. To- j
day's meeting, however, is expected to
be more productive of resuffs.
POLICE WANT DRIVER
OF DELIVERY WAGON
Lewis St. Armont Accused of Selling
Trunks He Should Have
â¢ Delivered.
The police have been searching: for
some .time .for Lewis St. Armont, a
"driver for Morton's delivery, but have
failed to find him. It Is supposed that
he has fled from the city to avoid ar
rest.
St. Armont Is accused of selling to
second-hand dealers trunks and their
contents that he had agreed to de
liver to their owners. At least four
complaints were made to the police
against him, one from a school teach
er of Oakland, one from a woman
from Portland, one from a visitor
from New York and another from a
stranger from Louisiana.
Detective Armstrong was detailed
on the case and he ascertained that
St. Armont had sold two of the trunks
to a dealer on Washington street and
the other two to a dealer on Mission
street, the sum obtained in each in
stance being $1. Armstrong also
learned that St. Armont had had an
account at the Hibernia Bank and had
withdrawn the amount on deposit
Baird and Chandler had dropped out
of sight, however. Thompson hunted
at all the downtown hotels, but could
find no trace of the Colorado Sheriff
or Chandler. v
Thompson enlisted the aid of private
detectives last night to try to find
Chandler and his captor from Colorado,
but they met with no success.
It is thought that Sheriff Baird of
Colorado took Chandler out of this city
on an evening train and then boarded
an overland train some time during the
evening.
Thompson was determined last night
to prevent Sheriff Baird from taking
Just as soon as the Supreme Court
had issued the second writ of habeas
corpus Attorney Thompson of Los An
freles started out to hunt up Sheriff
Baird of Colorado and serve him with
the order of court.
In the meantime the writ of extradi
tion issued by Governor Pardee a few
days ago was served on Sheriff White,
who was only too pleased to turn his
prisoner over to the Colorado Sheriff.
The second writ of habeas corpus
stated that Chandler was detained by
a. writ of the Governor of California,
vrhleh was correct, but the joker then
was to fiad Chandler and the Colorado
Sheriff.
Some hours after the decision of the
Supreme Court Chandler's attorneys
filed a second application for a writ of
habeas corpus for their client.
CHANDLER SPIRITED AWAY.
The application for the writ of habeas
corpus claimed that Chandler was not
a fugitive from justice from Colorado,
as alleged, end proceeded to give his
residences Fince the month of July,
when the Vindicator mine was blown
up.
Chandler's attorneys made a fatal er
ror, however, in their application. They
claimed that Chandler was illegally
held by a warrant, of the Governor of
California, who had ordered the sur
render of Chandler to the Colorado of
ficers on extradition proceedings.
. Chief Justice Bea,tty in dismissing the
application of Chandler held that, the
prisoner was simply held in custody on
a warrant of a Justice of the Peace of
Los Angeles County, and that it was
proper for Chandler to peek relief from
the Superior Court of that country be
fore applying to the Supreme Court.
Sheriff White left the Supreme Court
room with his prisoner and later on
turned Chandler over to Sheriff Baird
cf Colorado.
Attorneys D. E. Alexander and F. H.
Thompson of Los Angeles appeared for
Chandler, while Sheriff White of Los
Angeles County was represented by At
torney D. E. James.
The full bench of the Supreme Court
passpd upon the v.rit of habeas corpus
end disposed of the matter in a very
few minutes.
ATTORNEYS MAKE ERROR.
Chandler was arrested in Los An
fjeles on the evening of December 11 by
Sheriff White of Los Ang61es County,
acting on a telegram received from the
Colorado officials. It Is claimed that
Chandler was one of a party that plot
ted to blow up the Vindicator mine, in
Clear Creek County.. Colorado, which
resulted. in the destruction of property
and lives. Chandler since the time of
his arrest has fought the extradition
proceedings and retained counsel to de
fend, him. . .
- Last Saturday the Supreme Court is
eued a writ of habeas corpus, and
Sheriff While of Los Angeles County
brought Chandler to this city yester
day morning and produced him before
the court.
J. E. Chandler, secretary of the Min
ers' Union/if Clear Creek County, Colo
rado, who is Â¦wanted by the authorities
of that State on a charge of conspiracy
to commit arson, was brought before
the Supreme Court yesterday morning
on a writ of habeas corpus.
The existing, agreement expires on
the first day of the new year and, with
the intention of renewing it for an
other year, the members of the com
bine met in Portland last week,- but
failed to accomplish their purpose.
While the existing agreement was sat
isfactory to the millmen of the north,
the California manufacturers refused
*lo sign for another year. The feature
of the agreement to which the millmen
of thia State object is a clause which
provides that where a producer exceeds
the output 'apportioned to him by" the
organization he shall forfeit the pro
ceeds of the excess. The California
millmen have declared in favor of a
modification, of 'this provision, so that
a mill may produpe more than its quota
in districts where the demand exceeds
the supply without suffering the penal
ties prescribed by the combine.
Failing to effect a compromise on this
point, the Pacific Coast Lumbermen, as
the export combine is known, delegated
a committee composed of E. A. Skin
ner of Port Blakeley, Richard Alexander
and R. L. McCormick, to come to this
city and confer with the local lumber
men with a view toward settling the
present .'differences. If the conference
fails of the purpose of the committee
it is expected that there will be devel
oped a lively war among the exporters.
The latter have been selling at a basis
rate of $14, but a dissolution of the
present combine will knock this price
several points lower and, it ;is feared,
demoralize the export trade in so far
as the millmcn are concerned. ' â¢ >
R. L. McCormick is regarded as one
-R. L. McCormick, confidential man
for Frederick Weyerhaeuser, head | of
the biggest lumber- concern in the
world, accompanied by Richard Alex
ander, representing the principal lum
ber mills along the Colunibia River, ar
rived from Portland yesterday and is
registered at the Palace Hotel. The
coming of the Weyerhaeuser Timber
Company's representative has been
looked forward to with considerable
interest by local lumber men, for his
presence in San Etancisco at this par
ticular time has much to do with the
future conditions of the lumber busi
ness on the coast," and especially the
export trade,. on which the Weyerhaeu
sers have lately been steadily encroach
ing.
The export business of the coast has
been manipulated for two years- by a
combine in this city, in which are rep
resented the majority of the mills of
Washington, Oregon and California.
Through their organization th\y have
pro rated the amount of lumber that
each mill shall send to foreign ports,
basing the apportionment on the indi
vidual capacity of the mills. In this
manner the" output and the price of
lumber produced on the coast has been
regulated.
N LOCAL MILLS OBJECT. Â¦
A divorce is asked for on two grounds â
first, failure to provide, and second, deser
tion. The plaintiff herself testifies, as also
does her sister, that ever since Â«ne and her
husband separated she has supported herself.
Hrr at'parel evidenced that- she was able to
support herself as well, if not better, than
her husband could. The earnings of a wife
are as much community property as are the
earning? of a husband, and where a wife is
living in affluence, even if she does Herself
tarn the means so to do, she cannot secure
from her husband a divorce on the ground of
neglect and failure to provide. There is no
necessity for him to provide for her.
As to the defendant's) desertion, ther* is no
evidence In corroboration of the pViintlfr/s tes
timony that the desertion was willful or that
the defendant had no intention of . returning.
A divorce cannot be rranted on the uncorrob
orated testimony of the plaintiff.
For the foregoing reasons the divorce
rrayed for is denied and it Js ordered that
the plaintiff take nothing on her complaint and
that judgment be entered in favor of the'de
fendant.
In this case there Is considerable doubt In
my mind as to the residence of the plaintiff.
She swears she has . always*VesldÂ»d Jn this
city and county, but admits fhe haÂ» been long
abroad. Whether she can be considered a
bona fide resident is Very doubtful, but as
the evidence wholly fails to support the alle
gations of the complaint in other respects, it
will not be necessary to consider the question
of residence.
Judge Cook's decision is as follows:
JUDGES DECISION*.
After being here a few days she filed
a petition for divorce from her -hus
band, and on October 2 she and her sis
ter testified in Judge Cook's /court,* the
husband being represented by. Assist
ant District Attorney Porter Ashe, who
informed the court that Butler was in
San Antonio, Tex., and would not op
pose the suit. That afternoon Mrs. But
ler left for Monterey, and a few days
later the case was taken from the court
calendar, to be replaced when the neces
sity arose.
The evidence of Mrs. Aubrey was to
the effect that she and her husband
were married in Xew York on January
12. .1S95. They tame to this city and
lived for a short time at the Palace
Hotel. She claimed that her husband
had deserted her some years ago. She
said she was born in this city and con
sidered it her home. The only other
witness was her. sister, who gave cor
roborative testimony as to the deser
tion. â¢
FILES SUIT FOR DIVORCE.;
The attempt of Mrs. Violet Aubrey
Butler, a former actress well known in
the East, to obtain a divorce from her
husband. Guy T. Butler, has failed.
Judge Cook handed down a decision
yesterday afternoon in favor of the de
fendant.
Mrs. Butler arrived at the Palace
Hotel from the East about the end 6f
September, accompanied by her sister
and a colored maid. She created a sen
sation by the magnificence of her ward
robe and the luster and extent Â«f her
diamonds and jewelry.
ny, who is said' to have been in the
array at one time. She has been liv
ing: with O'Hare for the last month.
She said that she deserted Penny be
cause he objected to her aspirations
for the stage, #and then found" employ
ment in a variety theater at 406 Du
pont street. Recently O'Hare became
jealous of a piano player in the resort,
who paid" attentions to the woman,
and several violent quarrels have been
; the. result. Early last evening O'Hare
: went to the theater and during a dis
pute struck Mrs. Penny on the head
with a loaded club. He then left the
place and .was heard 'of no more until
nearly midnight, when the tragedy
happened.
When tbe theaterÂ«,was about to close
Mrs. Penny and Florence Sales, an
other actress, started in the direction
of California street, it being the inten
tion of the 'former to go to Penny's
residence at 32 Lynch street. Mrs.
Penny, fearing that O'Hare might mo- |
lest her, asked Jake Shebina, "spieler" '<
for the place, to accompany her as far j
as the car. and the trio started in. the
direction of California street. They had
gone but a short distance, when a shor
was fired from behind and Shebina, #
struck in the shoulder, fell to the pave
ment. Mrs. Penny turrrfed, and when
she saw O'Hare with the smofting re
"volver in his hand, started to run up
the hill. She passed Pine street and
the chase lasted to Jhe corner of Cali
fornia street. In the flight O'Hare fired
four more shots and the last one struck
the woman in the side.
O'Hare crossed to the north side of
California street and finished -^he trag
edy in the shadow of old St. Mary's
Church. He stood undetermined for
a moment until he saw Policemen Reed,
Cannon, McShane. Connor and Special
.Officer Paul Schmidt hurrying toward
him. As Reed was about Jto seize his
hand he turned, the revolver in the
direction of his head and the only bul
let that remained in the weapon crash
ed through' his brain. He died in
stantly.
O'Hare's mother. Mrs. Mary O'Hare,
lives at 363 South Court, San Jose.*. The
suicide and the Penny woman lived at
319% Mason street. The body of the
man was taken to the Morgue and his
victims to the Emergency Hospital.
A tragedy in low life occurred- on
Dupont street, between California and
Bush, late last evening. .IJan O'Hare,
jealous of Ethel Penny, a variety ac
tress with whom he has been living,
shot the woman, then Jake Shebina,
a- "spieler" for a resort," and then sped
a bullet into his .brain. O'Hare died
instantly, but Mrs. Penny and Shebina
were not fatally wounded.
