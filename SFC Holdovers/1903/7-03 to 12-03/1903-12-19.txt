The Tribuna S oes on to relate tnat
just about the time this scene was be
ing enacted in the papal apartments an
electrician, while removing the hang
ings in the late Pope Leo's chamber in
order to get at the electric light wires,
found in a' hole in the wall several bags
which were carelessly tied. These bags
when opened were found to contain 9,
250,000 francs (51.850,000). "
PARIS, Dec. 18.â The Rome corre
spondent of the Figaro says that Car
dinal Gotti, Prefect of the Propaganda,
and one of the executors of the will -of
Leo XIII, was received by the Pope yes
terday and informed his Holiness that
he held a; large sum of money confided
to him by. the late Pope" withUhe mis
sion that he should hand it to the new
Pontiff four . months after .] his election.
The alleged reason for . Pope Leo's
course is that he. wished his successor
to learn how, difficult.it -would "be; to
rule the church Â¦ 1 without ; money, there-*
by impressing .upon' him' Â¦ the; necessity,
for economy." The ; sum" left by Pope
Leo is said to "amount to ' $7,000,000.
four months had elapsed. This I now
do in the presence of Monsignor Marzo
llni, who has been the only other per-'
son to share the 'secret."
TJie Pope was much affected.
Intense curiosity was aroused by this
act, as it was believed to have some
relation to the missing wealth and the
wildest rumors were circulated. It soon
became known, however, that the bag
contained 45.000,000 francs (59,000,000) in
bank notes. When Cardinal Gotti en
tered the presence of the Pope he sank
to his knees and, pointing to his bur
den, said: ,
"Your Holiness, the lamented Leo,
just before his death, confided to me the
money which I . now. lay at your . feet,
saying that if I succeeded him I was to
use It as* I thought best, but that if an
other took his place I was to turn the
money over to him after a period of
BUNDLE^ OF BANKNOTES.
Cardinal Gottl, Prefect of the Propa
ganda, accompanied by Mgr. Marzo
llni, one of the late Pope's secretaries,
drove up to the Vatican to-day and,
getting out hurriedly, began tugging
at a heavy object in the carriage. As
sistance was offered, but it was re
fused, and Cardinal Gottl and Mgr.
Marzollni between them carried Jhe
mysterious object to the apartment of
Pope Piu3. They were immediately ad
mitted'and remained ror two hours.
ROME, Dec. 18.â According to the
Tribuna. the Vatican had sudMen
wealth poured Into its coffers to-day.
For some time certain sums which
were known to be possessed by Pope
Leo were looked for without result, the
search toward the end becoming some
what feverish.
The Del Norte left this city on De
cember 16 for Crescent City in charge
of Captain C. Green. Her net tonnage
is 2S0. She is owned by H6bbs, Wall
& Co. of this city.
The steam schoor.er Del Norte ran
down and sank the schooner Mary
Buhne yesterday eight miles off the
Humboldt Bar. None of the cVew of
the schooner were drowned, but one cf
the sailors of the Del Xorte lost his
life:
But meager reports of the accident
have been received. All the Informa

EMPLOYES IN' HIS OFFICE. WILL BE INDICTED BY THE GRAND
JURY AT ITS NEXT MEETING. .
hony owed sums of money and paid
with salary warrants, the latter's name
going down In the book as a regular
employe, although he never did any
work In the office. In all Davidson re
ceived 5700 In warrants from the Coun
ty Clerk.
Davidson admitted that he did not
earn this money in the office. He was
Mahony's milkman and the County
Clerk owed him a large bill. He was
put on the salary list at the office and
given a position at 5100 a month, al
though he never worked in the office.
Davidson testified that he was lg
r.orant of the fact that he was required
to work in the office In order to become
a bona fide clerk. He testified that he
did a little work on the books of the
office, but that he performed it all at
his residence, and not at the office, as
is required by law of all city employes.
Davidson further admitted that the
work he performed was not at all val- j
uabie to the city. He stated that it
could easily be accomplished by an or
dinary clerk in three weeks at the
mcEt, although he was kept on the
salary list for a period of seven months
and received salary warrants for 5700
from Mahor.y. which were cashed by
Broker Reg?nsburger.
Alonzo Davidson Jr. corroborated the
statements made by his father in the
matter of the work performed for the
County Clerk.- The son stated that he
br'mself had done several pages of
copying: for his father at his home and
that the father never worked in the of
fice of the County Clerk.
The next witness called was Alonzo
Davidson, the milkman, to whom Ma-
John J. Cassidy was asked to appear
before the jury yesterday afternoon,
but he did not materialize. He was
telephoned for several times, but he an
swered that it was impossible for him
to appear. He was then requested to
be present next Wednesday afternoon
at the next meeting of the jury, and
then In all probability he will share the
fate of the other four.
Frank French was the first witness
called. He was closeted with the jury
for an hour and during that time gave
some damaging evidence ajrainst the
County Clerk. He testified that he
knew the Inside workings of the of
fice and was in a position to tell many
things, and he did this readily and
Tsithout hesitation.
According to French's story Mahony
began to levy assessments on the em
ployes of his office when he first as
eumed charge there. For a starter the
County Clerk made a raise of $2000
from among his men. French swore to
this, and also that he himself collected
JSOO from various employes of the of
fice and turned this sum over to the
County Clerk in person.
It was also learned that Mahony bor
rowed money from John J. Cassidy of
the United Railroads. He made these
-touches" frequently, and in return
gave Cassidy Balary warrants, which
â¢were cashed by Broker Regensburger.
For this* Cassidy will have to appear
before the Grand Jury and explain.
DREW GOOD SALARY.
County Clerk Albert B. Mahony and
three employes of his officeâ "Colonel"
Martin Brady. John Pierce and Alonzo
Davidsonâ will be indicted by the
Grand Jury. This determination was
reached by that body after a two
hours' session yesterday afternoon. The
charges against the four men are de
frauding the city and securing salary
warrants by fraud and device.
The decision of the Grand Jury will
come as a mild surprise to Mahony and
his followers. Although it was feared
by all of them that the jury might
decide to indict them, rone of those
that thought they were "on the inside"
had the faintest suspicion that the jury
would take such severe action during
the very first day of the healing.
According to the present indications,
these four men arc not the only ones
that may have to answer to serious
charges. John J. Cassidy of the United
Railroads will be asked to appear be
fore the jury on next Wednesday aft
ernoon and he may be indicted also on
the same charges the others must face.
Three witnesses were examined yes
terday afternoon, and the evidence
{riven by one, Frank French, formerly
chief deputy in ilahony's office, was
deemed sufficient by the jury upon
â¢which to issue an indictment at some
later date. Alonzo Davidson and his
son, Alonzo Davidson Jr.. were the
other two to aprÂ»car as witnesses, and
they also made startling admissions.

GALVESTON. Tex.. Dec. 13.â The Fort Worth (Texas) Record this
morning, prints a special cable from Havana, Cuba, In which it. is stated
that a Colombian plot -has been unearthed there and that an *moloye In
the War Department of tho island has connived with other Colombian syna
' . pathizers and looted the arsenal of the city of Havana.
More than half of the contents have been moved to islands adjacent to
Arato River, near the boundary line of Colombia and Panama, conveniently
accessible to whatever point the conspirators may wish to remove the arms.
Thls'was taken on vessels secured from the . semi-plratlcal Haytien and
â¢ 'Jamaican craft. Now that it has been discovered that the arsenal was
robbed it may be that further plans for the removal of the remainder of
the war implements will be defeated.
; The cable also says that an expedition of Cuban sympathizers with
has gone to the Isle of Pines as a rendezvous, prepared to sail

PARIS, ' Dec. 18.-The "United Colombian Committee"
" here gave out a statement to-day. saying that Colombia would

The fire broke out about 11 .o'clock
in the top of the building, which was
four stories high and without fire
escapes. It was occupied by about
sixty students, who were asleep when
the alarm was given. The wildest
panic ensued, women and girls rushing
screaming to the windows, from which
they jumped In droves, tho dead and
injured lying in heaps where they fell,
to-be JV.llen upon by those following
them from the flaming windows.
Every ambulance in the city was
soon on the scene and the injured were
hurried to hospitals. When the flames
weie first discovered they seemed to
entirely envelope . the building and It
is considered almost certain that some
of the terrorized occupants were over
come by smoke before reaching the
.windows.
VANCOUVER. B. C Dec. 18. â The
long trip of the Canadian Paciflc-Lynn
Canal liner Amur from Skagway is
causing a great deal of speculation
along the water front. The Amur has
been out from the Lynn Canal port
since Saturday and was due here
Wednesday noon. The only feasible
explanation . seems to be that she has
encountered rough weather in the
north and been forced to lie up in

WASHINGTON. Dec. 18.â John A.
Benson, a wealthy San Francisco real
estate operator, charged by the Interior
Department with being the head~tÂ»f the
alleged land frauds " extending over a
dozen Western States and Territories,
to which Secretary Hitchcock referred
vigorously and at length in .his annual
report, was arrested here to-day at the
Willard Hotel by Secret Service Officer
Burns just as Benson Was. preparing to
leave the city for New York.
The charge on which the arrest was
made was bribery," it -being alleged in
the affidavit of Burns and in the war
rant that Benson had j paid 5500 to
Woodford D. Harlan, formerly chief of
the special service' division of the-Gen
eral Land Office and now a- clerk in
that office, on March 15 of this year
for the purpose of extracting from him

to be assembled at League Island 'will be the last that zcill be sent to the isthmus, the' inference being, that troops will be sent if it is concluded that the American force there needs further strengthening.

LONDON, Dec. 18.â A special dis
patch from St. Petersburg says: "Op
timistic anticipations of a pacific solu
tion of the Russo-Japanese crisis arc
still entertained in the leading Russian
official circles in spite of some dis
quietude on the part of the public and
alarmist press reports."
Russo-Japanese war risks at Lloyds'
rose about 5 per cent to-day, 20 guineas
per cent being quoted to the end oi
January and 25 to the end of February.
Ordinary insurance on. a cargo to
Japan rose about 5 per cent, with a fair
amount of business.
Japanese bonds declined on the Stock
Exchange from % to 1 point, but rallied
and closed unchanged.
The opinion here Is that the Rueso-
Japanese negotiations will proceed. II
is pointed out that there is no reasor
why Japan, if not satisfied with Rus
sia's reply, should break off the nego
tiations, since the reply Is in no sens*
an " ultimatum, leaving the way opcr
for counter proposals. It is suggestec
as an expedient, in case no agreemen!
can be reached, that an arrangemen 1
might be made to maintain the presem
status for a number of years.
" BIZERTA, Tunis, Dec. 18.â The Rus

Oslabya, the cruiser Aurura and five
torpedo boats, commanded by Admiral
Wirenius, will be re-enforced in a few
days by six torpedo boats and proceed
hence to the Far East.
LONDON, Dec. 18.â London regards
war in the Far East as practically in
evitable. What form Japan's reply to
the long delayed Russian rote has
taken is not known outside of the For
eign Office, to which it was communi
cated yesterday, but It is believed that
Â¦while an opening is left for further
negotiations Russian proposals are re
jected as inacceptable. It Is stated
that the first draft of the Japanese
reply was couched in terms like those
of an ultimatum, but that through
Lord Xiansdowne's influence a more
conciliatory tone was adopted. Nobody
here believes that either side will abate
a jot or tittle of iffc claims and the only
questions now asked are for how long
hostilities can be postponed and which
power will g_et in the first Blow. A re
port was telegraphed from London to
a provincial paper that war had ac
tually broken out and that the Japan
ese Minister was deluged with inquiries.
Viscount Hayassi's tone was op
timistic than usual, though he ex
pressed confidence that negotiations
would be continued.

Holiday and retail business generally

Just . c-perations to changed conditions
of demand and supply. Cold weather,
is still an important stimulus to heavy
wearing apparel and footwear.
There are several continuously en-
couraging features noted. The car con
gestion of a year ago is- conspicuously
absent this year, and the railways are
handling the current excellent business
offering with profitable results. Fail
ures do not display more than the nor
mal tendency to increase in number
and there is evidently less tension than
exhibited a month ago.
The iron trade retains all the good
feeling that advances on prices of pig
iron reported in preceding weeks and
makers of finished products, most no
tably steel plates and structural forms,
are apparently firm in their views.
Prices, all things considered, showed
marked steadiness, confirming reports
of closely held supplies. The metals are
all strong and some grades of foundry
pig iron, tin and lead are higher on
better volume of business. Seasonable
quiet does not appreciably affect build
ing material, which, judging from per
mits issued at leading cities, is likely to
be active next spring. Petroleum - is
at the hishest price in years, due to
increased demand for fuel and strait
ened conditic-n of old fields of supply.

"This man was at the head of a great
land fraud conspiracy 'extending over
several Western States. He has bribed
officers of the United States in the West
DECLARATION OF ATTORNEY;
The information on which the war
rant was issued stated in brief .that Mr.
Harlan, (n his capacity as chief of the
special service division of the General
I^and Office, had charge of the investi
gation of the land frauds, sending out
special agents in suspected cases of
fraud and receiving the reports of such
agents on the cases, and that Benson
had paid to him the sum of $500 in re
turn for being allowed to examine the
reports of the special agents on hi3
own case. The specific offense alleged
is that Benson unlawfully gave money
to an officer of the United States, act
ing in behalf of the United States in
an official function, with intent to in
duce him to do an act in violation of
his lawful duty, contrary to section
5451 of the Revised Statutes.
Attorneys Pugh and Pagin were yes
terday sworn in as assistant United
States attorneys for the purpose of
prosecuting the case.
Benson is said to have been taken
entirely by surprise in his arrest, al
though he has known that the Govern
ment has been investigating the al
leged land frauds. He had no lawyer
in Washington, and when he was talten
immediately before United States Com
missioner Taylor a delay of an hour
or more occurred while a lawyer was
sought for him. Benson made a for
mal p!ea of not guilty, and then his
attorney aBked that he be released on
bail. The accused offered bail in $2000
cash, while the Government attorneys
demanded bond in the sum of $10,000,
Attorney Pagin for the Government
saying:
The statement was made later that
Secretary Hitchcock was so incensed
at the flagrancy of this alleged offense
that he told the officers to have Ben
son arrested at once, although it had
not been planned to apprehend him at
present. Another assertion of the Gov
ernment officers is that Benson came
to Washington in answer to decoy let
ters, and with the intention of bribing
people in the Land Office, who were in
reality acting for the secret service.
The warrant on which Benson was
arrested charged that on March 15 last
he unlawfully gave "a sum of money,
to wit: $500 to one Woodford D. Harlan,
who was then and there an officer of
the said United States, to wit: chief
of the special service division of the
General Land Office of the United
States, with intent to induce the said
Woodford D. Harlan to do an act in
violation of his lawful duty as an offi
cer, that is to say, reveal to him, the
said John A. Benson, the contents of
the reports of certain subordinates in
the office of him. the said Woodford D.
Harlan, concerning an investigation of
the conduct of the said John A. Benson
ar.d his associates in making fraudulent
selections and entries of public liinds
of the said United States, in lieu of
lands owned by them within the limits
of forest reserves theretofore estab
lished under the laws of the United
States in *he States of California and
Oregon, and in committing trespass on
the said public lands."
BRIBERY AMONG CHARGES.
AUTHORITIES MAKE HASTE.
er alleged offenders until the principals'
in the case had been apprehended.
The Government attorneys, Arthur
B. Pugb, who has been the special at
torney for the Interior Department on
the land frauds, and Oliver Pagin, as
sistanx attorney of the Department of
Justice, who has also been employed on
the case, stated, in asking for a lafge
ball bond for Benson, that he had been
gnnty of bribery during his present
visit to Washington since last Monday
and In the Interior Department itself,
not-withstanding he was fully aware
that his connection with the alleged
frauds was fully known by the depart
ment.
, Benson is the senior member of the
real estate firm of Benson & Hyde of
San Francisco and, it is asserted, has
defrauded the Government out of at
least 100,000 acres of land by various
schemes since the passage of the forest
reserve act of 1897. That act provides
that the owner of land which is wanted
by the Government for a forest reserve
shall be allowed to select in place of it
other public land. It is - alleged that
Benson obtained advance information
as to the land that would be wanted
by the Government for forest reserves,
and that by means of fraudulent entries
or by purchase immense tracts of such
lands were obtained and afterward ex
changed for valuable public lands.
The information alleges that frauds
were perpetrated as to lands in Wash
ington, .Oregon, California, Montana,
Idaho, Nevada. Utah, Wyoming, Colo
rado, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Arizona
and New Mexico. TJie ' investigation
into frauds under the forest reserve act,
it is said, was begun- by Secretary
Hitchcock about a year ago and has
been pursued steadily since then. Com
missioner Richards of the General Land
Office said to-night that on assuming
office he reduced Woodford Harlan from
chief of the civil service division of the
General I^and Office to a clerkship be
cause he was dissatisfied with his work
and his method of conduc .ing his of3ce.
and In the District. Since he came to
this citv a few days ago he has con
tinued his bribery. And, what is more,
in another case some years ago, when
he was out on bonds, he left the coun
try and went to a foreign country and
remained away for several years."
A heated argument followed this
declaration, counsel for the defense as
serting: it was improper. Finally Com
missioner Taylor fixed the bond at $5000
and Mr. Benson was released to appear
December 30, when a preliminary hear
ing will take place. The accused de
clines to make any statement further
than to say he would appear when
wanted.

OFFICIALS ACCUSE BENSON OF BRIBERY
WASHINGTON, Dec 15.â Senator Morgan to-day Introduced a resolution
declaring that the President has no right to wage war against any foreign
power without the consent of Congress when such country Is at peace with
the United States; that the provision of the canal treaty between the United
States and Panama is, in effect, a declaration of war with Colombia; that
the intervention of the United States in preventing Colombia, suppressing the
secession of Panama is contrary to the law of neutrality and the law of na
tions. The important features 'of the Â« solution are:
"That neither the President nor the President and the Senate, as the
MORGAN DECLARES THE PRESIDENT
HAS NO POWER TO SEND WARSHIPS
Carpenter Charles E. Richardson has been detached from duty at Mare
Island and ordered to the cruiser Atlanta at Colon. He will take passage
down the coast on the armored cruiser New York, which is due at San
Francisco on the 23d inst., en route from Bremerton to Panama.
VALLEJO, Dec 18.â Considerabe excitement was created at the navy
yard this #rfternoon by the receipt of orders to place tne gunboat Manila in
commission. The Manila was captured from the Spaniards in the Philip
pines and has-been lying at Mare Island for a year and a half. It is esti
mated that it would cost $150,000 to put her in good shape, but the situation
on the isthmus of Panama may. demand her services in her present condition.
Shortly after 11 o'clock this morning* the torpedo-boat destroyers Paul
Jones and Preble tied up alongside the navy yard after a quick run from San
Francisco, where they had their hulls cleaned and painted. Their ammuni
tion and stores are about ready and they are awaiting the arrival from the
East of the officers detailed to them.

Up blamed Russia for this condition
of affairs and warned ths Senate that

country over the Manchurian question,
which, he says, has been responsible
for the inability of the United States
plenipotentiaries vo obtain the opening
of the- other important ports under more
favorable conditloriS.
The ntlitude taken by Nelson xras
upheld in speeches by a number of
other Senators, although it was argued
at the same time that this treaty is an
entering wedge tn oiir trade and that it
was the best China was able to do un
der Russian drrresr- Lodge urged the
importance of bavins the treaty rati
fied an fl raid that the State Depart
ment ccmsiderpfl immediate action as
essential. He declared that the ratifi
cation probably ttot;13 iave a bearing
en the setilfraent of Ih5 Far Eastern
q-nestlor.. Senators Morgan, Cullom,
Spooner and s- num'ber of others agreed
with Lcds*- It was stated by some of
the cfyealrerF that if Russia had obJecV
tion to tho treaty it had not been ap
parcr.u and, on the contrary, it was
fuiid that she had openly expressed her
approval of it- There was no division
on the motion to ratify.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 18.â The Senate
in executive session to-day ratified the
treaty for the extension of the comme>
cial rolatioiis between the United States
and China and then removed the in
junction of secrecy- No opposition â¢was
manifested by any Senator to ths
treaty, although Nelson (R.) of Minne-
FCta made a long spsech in which he
criticized the convention zs making in
sufficient provision fcr the trade of ths
United States. He F^-id it indicated
that the hand of Russia had been
Bhown against this country, making it
impossible for the United Slates to re
ceive the concessions needed in the way
of open ports. He said that the ports of
Mukden and An Tung, which are open
ed under the treaty, are in fact inland
ports, accessible only to vessels of light
draught.
Senate Adopts Treaty
to Extend Trade
in Orient.
Daniel of Virginia was the speaker^ ar.d ha advocated the acceptance
of Hoar's resolution calling on the President for more information relative
to the November revolution in Panama.
Cullom called attention to ths fact that the Panama treaty has not
been acted upon by the Committee on Foreign Relations, and intimating
that it was not in order to discuss it. Daniel retorted by saying that
"there is so much nervousness over any inquirj' on the part of Republican
Senators as to cause them to Jump before they have been spurred." He
said that the President had discussed the treaty in public, and called at
tention to Secretary Loomis' New York speech, as well as to the debates
in the Senate, and declared that "never before had there been such a thor
ough defiance and contempt of the law of S9crecy which prevails in diplo
matic affairs as have been displayed in this matter."
Daniel also referred to Minister Bunau-Varilla, and said of him that,
while it is true that all men play many parts in the course of their lives,
that gentleman had "played more parts in a shorter time than any other
actor who had challenged favor from back of the footlights."
Taking up the resolution, he said that he did not want to see the United
States involved in war either with France or with Colombia, and he was
Inclined to accept with a grain of salt the sensational headlines printed in
the papers yesterday over the speeches of acting Secretary Loomis and Min
ister Bunau-Varilla, Some people, he said, seek to establish a wide-open
republic* "as if some prodigious Tammany were about to take possession
of the country, and they are shaking their red lights from many points."
He contended that the independence of Panama had not been well estab
lished, as has been stated, and in this connection called attention to the
fact that the country has no constitution.
Daniel said he knew of no requirement in international law for the
recognition of a new government before it was formed. Things were hap
pening in Washington before there was anything doing on the isthmus.
When, where and at what time, he asked, had the United States undertaken
to ser.il out forces to the border of any country to prevent that country
from keeping peace in its own country? There was not at that time even
a germ of a republic â not even the phantom of a republic
"It Vas the city and not the state that is responsible for the outbreak
of the revolution on the isthmus," he said. â
When Daniel closed, Fulton of Oregon took the floor to advocate the
passage a* the bill providing an appropriation for the proposed Lewis and
Clark exposition. He said thai the only request is that the United States
Government shall make prevision for participation in the celebration, but
even If Congress should fail to make the appropriation the exposition
would be opened and held. He -contended that the exposition would not
be a local affair. All the States traversed by Lewis and Clark were con
cerned, and the event was in many of its aspects of national importance.
An executive session of the Senate was then held. When the doors re
opened the Senate passed a large number of private pension bills and at
5:43 n- m. adjourned-
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18. â After a conference to-day between Secretary
Moody and Rear Admiral Taylor, chief of the Bureau 'of Navigation, and
Brigadier General -George J.Elliott, commandant of the Marine Corps, it
was decided that if present conditions on the Isthmus of Panama continue
General Elliott will sail for Colon on the Dixie from Philadelphia when that
vessel goes south with the battalion of marines which has been ordered as
sembled" at Philadelphia for' "dispatch, to the isthmus. The Dixie is now on
her way,Tiortli;for this purpose. General Elliott has been anxious for some
days to be given a field command, and it is the present Intention :bf officials
to grant his request. f t ( Â¦ 'â¢ . . , <i
It was said at the Navy Department to-day that in view of the growing
complications over the Panama situation It was inadvisable to longer an
nounce the plans' of the' department withf. the freedom shown .'during the
last few weeks, and for that reason a cablegram received to-day from Rear
Adjniral Coghlan was not made public. -
The resolution of-the-Senate and House -of Representatives in 1899 is re-..
peated. The .sense -of this is that the Government of. the United States looks
with serious concern and ; disapproval on any^ connection of any European
Government with the construction of a ship canal acros the isthmus.

AMONG THE MANY ATTRACTIVE WOMEN PRESENT -AT THE
.GREENWAY ASSEMBLY IN THE PALACE HOTEL LAST NIGHT.
TACOMA, Dec. 18.â An earthquake
last Tuesday broke off the southeastern
peak of Mount Rainier, lying sixty
miles southwest of Tacoma. Hundreds
of acres of rocks and ice, including a
number of glaciers; were broken loose
and hurled two miles down the moun
tain side into the valleys below.
Mount Rainier Is nearly fifteen thou
sand feet high, being surmounted with
three peaks, the highest of which has
been known for twenty years as Colum
bia's Crest. Thls-peak stood on the
southeastern corner- of the mountain's
brow, being visible throughout Wash
ington, and on clear days from British
Columbia, Idaho and Oregon. The peak
contained a crater several hundred feet
in diameter, in which mountain-climb
ers have usually spent the night on the
mountain's top. Sulphurous fumes and
steam are always rising from this
crater, keeping it free from snow the
year round. Higher up the peak was
always covered with snow and ice. The
mountain has a glacial system compris
ing fifteen distinct glaciers, several of
them being located on its southeast
slope.
The earthquake was felt, at several
points throughout Eastern Washington
Tuesday night. The breaking of Mount
Rainier's peak was witnessed by' State
Senator Ruth of Olympia and George
E. Huggins, a wealthy stockman own
ing ranges around the southern base of
the mountain. They were startled
Tuesday morning by the earthquake
shock, followed by reports similar to
the firing of heavy artillery. These
gradually increased to a great roar.
Looking toward the mountain, they ob
served that the southeastern peak had
broken off and was tumbling down the
slope. Slides continued all day. In the
afternoon there was Â« a broad black
streak of bare rock where before ice
and snow had been piled hundreds of
feet high.
Huggins and Ruth made public what
they witnessed to-day. Loud reports
were heard accompanying the earth
quake hundreds of miles away in East
ern Washington. They were undoubt
edly, caused by the tumbling of the
peak. *

The Greenway holiday dance at the
Palace Hotel last night was fully up
to expectations and anticipations. It
Â¦was nearly 11 o'clock before the ball
opened, and it was even later than that
before those who had participated in
the numerous dinner functions of the
evening began to arrive. By midnight
the scene was brilliant. There was a
display of gorgeous gowns and spark
ling Jewels, and the soft, mellow glow
of the crimson lights added much to the
beauty of the scene.
Society turned out in great numbers,
and all entered into the joySusness of
the occasion, the pleasure of which was
undoubtedly enhanced by the general
gayety that naturally prevails during
this festive holiday season.
As usual with the Greenway dances,
the music was one of the special fea
tures of the evening. A pleasant inno
vation was made by the introduction of
a number of the old time famous
Strauss waltzes, interspersed with com
positions of a more recent date. Among
those which especially seemed to add tq
the mazy whirl of the dance were the
old favorites, "Blue Danube,". "Wine,
Women and Song." "Morning Journal"
and "Girls of Baden." Then there were
selections from "Princess Louise,"
"Dolly Varden" and "Prince of Pilsen."
Others that filled in were "If You Love
Me, Darling," "Life's Pleasure" and the
"New Bully."
An important event of the ball was
the debut of Miss Constance de Young,
second daughter of Mr. and Mrs. M. H.'
de Young. She was chaperoned by Mrs.
Oelrichs. The pretty debutante, who
has a sweet and lovable personality,
was unusually attractive in a Parisian
gown of white silk mull, made with
many puffs on sleeves, skirt and bodice,
the puffs being outlined with garlands
of orange blossoms.
One of the chief guests of the evening
was Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs. who ap
peared shortly before midnight with
Mrs. Walter Martin. Mrs. Rudolph
Spreckels and Mrs. Mountford Wilson.
It was Mrs. Oelrichs' first appearance
at any evening function since her ar
rival from New York, and she' was
much observed in her extremely artistic
gown of white net embroidered in fine
spangles and made over pale blue chif
fon and silk. At Intervals on the bodice
and skirt were insertions of black chif
fon flowers. A panel of black spangled
net extended down the back of the
skirt to the end of the long train. Flow
ing angel sleeves of spangled white net
fell from the shoulder to the elbow
and strands of knotted blue chiffon and
black satin flowers caught with blue
ribbons were also suspended from the
shoulders. Mrs. Oelrichs also wore a
dog collar and a double rope of pearls
about her neck.

A PETITION FOR A PARDON
The Southern Pacific Company will
soon proceed with some very important
Improvements in Oakland. The settle
ment of the condemnation suit brought
by that company against Mrs. Gretch
en Feldman, by which the company se
cured possession of two square blocks
of land at Fifth and Cypress streets,
will enable them to carry out some
plans they have had In contemplation
for two years.
The freight yards of Oakland are to
be located upon the property that was
acquired by this suit, and a large
freight depot will be erected at that
point. This will cause the abandon
ment of the freight yards at Sixteenth
street and at the foot of Market street.
The yards at Â¦ Sixteenth street "are a
source of a great deal of annoyance to
the passengers who take the trains at
that point...
When the new*, freight yards have
been completed two new depot build
ings will be erected, one at Sixteenth
street and one at the foot of Broadway.
The depot at Sixteenth street i3 small
and old and dirty and is out of keeping
with the importance of a city of the
size of Oakland. At. the foot of Broad
way, there is no depot at all, and the
passengers for points south of Oakland
wait In a small store which is occupied
as a depot by the company.
It Is expected that the coming year
will see the completion of work that
will be of great advantage to the. city.

BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 18.â Charl#s
Young, a merchant, had a battle early
this morning with two^burglars In the
basement of his residence. He wound
ed one of the burglars in the leg with
a rifle and the second burglar fired
three shots at Young without effect.
Both of . the burglars escaped In the
darkness, one of them groaning with
pain.
The matter was reported to the Sher-"
Ift's office and within an hour Under
Sheriff Baker had located Roy Lampert
as one of the burglars. Lampert was
found In bed In a house in the red light
district "with a rifle ball In his leg. He
owes his life to the f-act that the bullet
struck the butt of his pistol, as other
wise it would have entered his abdo
men. Lampert claims that he was
alone when the burglary was attempt
ed, but the tracks around the house
show /there were two men.
LOS ANGELES. Dec. 18.-sAfter a
session of more than flve hours the
Coroner's jury called together for the
purpose of investigating the killing of
Joseph and Louis Choisser last night
by Detectives Hawley, Murphy and
Cowan rendered a verdict to-night of
Justifiable homicide. The jury was
composed of prominent business men.
The testimony given by the three offi
cers tended to show that the Cholssers
opened fire upon them without a mo
ment's hesitation and that they used
their revolvers to protect their own
lives.
J. S. Atkinson, who occupied a room
next to that of the Choissers, and who
made a statement this morning that
the dead men were not armed when
they were shot, did not appear to tes
tify "before the Coroner's Jury. Mrs.
Louise Falrchild, a cousin of the dead
men, told the Jury of the good charac
ter and standing of Joseph Choisser in
Equality, 111., where he had resided for
many years, and that to her knowledge
he had never committed a crime.
EQUALITY, 111., Dec. 18.â Joseph
Choisser, who with his son was killed
at Los Angeles, Cal., was a fugitive
from Justice, having purchased a lot of

Illinois, and given in payment alleged
worthless checks for J1800, drawn on
the Bank of Eldorado, 111., for which

NORFOLK, Va., Dec. 18.â A success
ful, trial of a flying machine tias been
made near Kitty Hawk, N. C. by Wil
bur and Orvllle Wright of Dayton,
Ohio. The machine flew for three miles
in the face of a wind blowing at the
registered velocity of twenty-one miles
an hour, and then gracefully descended
to earth at the spot selected by the
navigator. The machine has no balloon
attachment, but gets its force . from
propellers worked by a small engine.
Preparatory to its flight the machine
was placed upon a platform near Kitty
Hawk. This platform was built on a
high sandhill, and when all was In
readiness the fastenings to the machine
were released and It started down an
Incline. The navigator, Wilbur
Wright, then started a small gasoline
engine, which worked the propellers.
When the end of the Incline was
reached the machine gradually arose
until it obtained an altitude of sixty
feet. In the face of the strong wind
blowing it maintained an even speed of
eight miles an hour. The Idea of the
boxkite has been adhered to In the
basic formation of the flying machine.
A huge framework of light timbers thir
ty-three feet wide, flve feet deep and five
feet across the top forms the machine
proper. This Is covered with a tough
but light canvas. In the center is the
navigator's car, and suspended Just be
low the bottom plan Is a small gasoline
engine, which furnished the motive
power fcr the propelling and elevating
wheels. There are two six-blade pro
pellers, one arranged Just below the
.frame so as to exert an upward force
when In motion, and the other extend
ing horizontally to the rear from the
center of the car, furnishing the for
ward impetus. Protruding from the
center of the car is a huge fan-shaped
rudder of canvas, stretched upon a
frame of wood. This rudder is con
trolled by the navigator and may be
moved to each Glde, raised or lowered.

filled with soil taken from the grain
fields that have almost ceased to pro
duce. Six of them are planted with
wheat, six with barley and six with al
falfa.
The receptacles will be irrigated with
different portions of water. For in
stance, one will receive nothing only
the natural rainfall, which is estimated
at six inches for the section; another
will receive four inches, another eight
inches, anothc twelve inches, another
sixteen inches, another twenty inches,
all in addition to the regular rainfall.
The soil filling these tanks is from
fields that last year only yielded from
a sack to two sacks of grain an acre,
whereas in former years, before it was
worn out, it yielded from fourteen to
sixteen sacks. This poor yield was. ob
tained without irrigation, that is, with
the natural rainfall, but it is thought
that with more water the soil may, be
made to be more productive.
The experiments have an important
bearing on the dry farming of the
State, where millions of acres are cul
tivated without the aid of irrigation,
the farmers trusting entirely to the
rainfall. In San'Joaquln County alone
last year 400.000 acres were farmed
without receiving much rain. The
yields are becoming less and less
profitable every year on account of the
decrease per acre, but by irrigating it
is possible that the land may be made
to yield more.
Suttcliff and Tighe were taken into
custody at â¬3S Clay street, and Attridge
at 101 Ellis street. Sutcliff was forcner-
Jy employed at the Union Iron Works
and Tighe, who Is a waiter, claims
that his father Is a cancer specialist
at Twenty-third and Chattanooga
etreets. Attridge is a cook's helper and,
according to tbe detectives, has been
a. race track tout.
During the six weeks that the officers
have been on the case they have se
cured every coin that has been passed
by purchasing them from the receivers.
Callan is supposed to be an old hand
at the business, although young in
year*, and recently came here from Se
attle, where he was employed by A.
Hunbach. None of the men arrested
are over 30 years of age. Tighe is a
member of the Waiters' Union. No. 30,
and Attridge of the Cooks' Helpers'
Union, No. 110. They will be transferred
from the City Prison to the County
Jail to-day and taken before Commis
sioner Heacock for examination.
Three volumes entitled, respectively,
"A Counterfeiter -Foiled," "Roguery of
a Counterfeiter" and "A Lady Shadow'*
â¢were also brought to light, but it is not
believed that the reading of this se
ductive literature was primarily re
sponsible for Callan's advent into the
business.
Last evening Hazen, Foster and Mc-
Manus swooped down on Callan's room,
at 563 Mission, and placed him under
arrest. A search of the room brought
to light a heavy iron chest in which
were concealed all the appurtenances
essential for the operation of the un
authorized mint-
necessary to insure a # conviction. A
complete outfit containing everything
essential to the manufacture of spu
rious coin, from a furnace to a pair of
gold scales, was found in the room of
Cailan, 5G3 Mission Street. He was the
prime mover in the scheme. In addi
tion about $200 In counterfeit halves
was also secured.
About six weeks ago information was
received by Secret Service Agent Hazen
that a number of spurious half dollars
were being passed on the Geary and
Sutter street cars. T. B. Foster and T.
n. McManus vrere detailed on the case
and in a short time discovered who were
the culprits. Every movement of the
"four men was watched day and night
'. and it was soon ascertained that Callan
. was the manufacturer of the coin.
He was exceedingly wary and from
Ms actions showed that he feared that
he was being shadowed. Day by day
the detectives kept up their shadow
work and soon found where Callan was
buying his metal. So shrewd was he
that he would often double on his
tracks to ascertain if he^ was being
followed, and on one occasion led his
pursuers a merry chase over the sum
mit of Telegraph Hill. Suttcliff, Tighe
and Attridge were not even aware of
the address of their chief and were
compelled to be content with passing
the money on a commission of 13 cents
on the half dollar.
Callan, after manufacturing a batch
of coins, would destroy the molds, and,
on December 2, at First and Minna
gtreets, dropped several of them in the
eewer, where they were subsequently
recovered by the detectives, by the aid
of a lantern and ladder. The quartet
worked under cover of darkness, and
Callan would meet Suttcliff and Tighe
In a resort at C38 Clay street, where
they would be supplied with the
counterfeit money. Attridge, who had
sportier inclinations," " frequented , a
saloon at 101 Ellis street and Callan
nightly met him there. "During the six
weeks' investigation the detectives
never for a moment lost sight of their
men and often went without sleep and
food.
With the arrest last night of Charles
W. Callan. George Tighe, Charles Sutt
cliff and John Altridge by Secret Ser
vice Operatives George W. Hazen, T.
B. Foster and T. It. McManus, a quar
tet of clever counterfeiters has finally
been run to earth and for their efforts
to wax rich by actively, engaging in
the manufacture and distribution of
counterfeit half dollars a long term in
the penitentiary stares them in the
face.
Great cleverness was displayed by
the officers in securing the evidence
In reference to the proposed statue
of Junipero Serra, which James D. Phe
lan has promised to contribute. Mr.
Lloyd suggested that the foundation
should be of stone taken from the site
at Monterey where Father Junipero
Serra first landed in California.
The commission gave a vote of
thanks to William Greer Harrison for
a f.nc Specimen of graphite from
Xome. Reuben IT. Lloyd was thanked
for the . gift of a medal which was
struck to commemorate the cession of
New Amsterdam by Holland to Eng
land. These articles go to the memo
rial museum.
It was reported that three coyotes
had been killed in the park during the
last week. It appears that coyote pups
are brought to town as pets, and when
found to be uninteresting are turned
loose in the park to subsist on quail
and rabbits. ' Word comes from the
Spreckels ranch near Gilroy that six
pheasant.hens and a rooster have been
trapped. The birds will be placed in
Golden Gate Park. The Commissioners
will, not meet again until next year.
On motion of Commissioner Lloyd,
seconded by Commissioner Altman, the
subject was referred to the City Attor
ney. The right of the Board- of Super
visors to lease property that has been
reserved as public squares will be de
termined. Steps may be taken to se
cure money collected under such lease.
TJie Commissioners propose to utilize
the Bum of $2300 given to the park by
Mrs. William McCauley in building a
stone gateway at the Haight-street en
trance. Mr. Altman was requested to
confer* with John McGillvray and ascer
tain the best that could be done for
the sum at the disposal o^ the commis
sion.
In the matter of the two blocks bounds

Bay Fhore Railrond Company for terminal
purposes by the Board of Supervisors tor a

â¢ 'A meeting of the Park Commission
was held yesterday afternoon at the
office of A. B. Spreckels, president of
the board. The secretary having been
instructed by the board to make In
quiry concerning the occupancy of
lands reserved for park purposes, pre
sented this report:
One of the most significant things in
railway operations for the last three
years has been the marked and gen
eral advance in rates. Such* Increase
applies in almost all sections of the
country and to many of the most im
portant kinds of traffic. These increases
are general and they amount In the
aggregate to an enormous sum. The
effect of these advances has been to
correspondingly increase the tax laid
upon the general body of producers and
consumers In this country for the bene
fit of the owners of railway property.
The commission refers again to the
evils resulting from excessive payments
by railroad companies for the use of
private car?, particularly those owned
and controlled by shippers, and recom
mends that the payment of car mileage
for their use be regulated.
Fcr the year ending June 30. 1903, S21
passengers and 3233 employes were
killed in railway accidents, and 6973
passengers and 39.004 employes injured.
The appalling loss of life and property
in collisions is noted,' and the commis
sion urges the desirability of the in
troduction of tho block system. /
The gross earnings of railway* for
the year ending June 30, 1903. were
$1,890,150,679. The gross earnings for
the previous year were $1,726,380,267.
"WASHINGTON. Dec. IS.â The seven
teenth annual report of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, transmitted to
Congress to-day, says in part:
The preliminary income account for
the year ending June 30, 1903, shows
railway returns for 201.457 miles of line,
which is approximately 98 per cent of
the entire mileage in the United States.
Gross earnings for that year amounted
to $1,890,150,679, or $9382 per mile of line.
Operating expenses aggregated $1,248,
520,483, or' $6191 per mile, leaving net
earnings of $641,630,106, or $31S5 per
mile. Fifty-three million dollars In,
taxes is not Included 1Â« this statement
of operating expenses. Compared with
the previous year, the net earnings are
greater by some thirty- four millions
and stock dividends are greater by
nearly ten millions. In 1897 the gross
earnings averaged only $6122 and ope
rating expenses $4106 per mile of line.
PURPOSE OF ELKIN'S LWV.
The report discusses at length the
El kins law. The Commissioners say
that the original law, the act to regu
late commerce, embraces two distinct
objects, or seeks to correct two kinds
of railroad abuses: First, to secure
the publication of tariff rates which
shall be just and reasonable and free
from discriminations: and second, to
compel carriers to observe the tariffs
so published without variation or ex
ception. It continues:
"Broadly speaking, the latter class of
offenses only are affected by the Elkins
act, the provisions of which are mainly
designed to prevent or more effectually
reach those infractions of law, like the
payment o? rebatea and kindred prac
tices, which are classed as misdemean
ors. Under this amendment the rail
way corporation itseif is liable to prose
cution in all cases where Its officers and
agents are liable under the former law.
Thi3 change corrects a defect which
has always been a source of embarrass
ment, because it gave immunity to the
principal and beneficiary of a guilty
transaction. It 1* believed that much
benefit will result from the fact that
proceedings can now be taken against
the corporation."

tin to serve four years. Wbi.e on the
boat at Port Harford pier the officer
and his prisoner were in <i stateroom.
Rosy took a water bottle and struck
Ward on the head and escap?d through
the window. Owing to a sixt*>n-nouna
Oregon boot he was unablj t> swim
and clung to a pile until Sheriff Ivan
of San Lois Obispo County captured
him. Ward died about ten 'Iay3 after
ward. .
.Â» Ross was tried, convicted and sen
tenced to nans. He arrived at San
Quentin in March. 1899. The case was
appealed and a new trial granted. He
was found guilty on his second trial.
The case was taken to the State Su
preme Court several times and to the
United States Sunreme Court once.
Ross had wealthy relatives in the East
who spent fully $10,000 trying to save
him. As a last resort Rev. Father Egan
appealedfto. Governor Pardee last week,
setting forth, reasons for a commuta
tion of the sentence to life imprison
ment. The chief executive, however,
failed to intervene and the condemned
man ultimately became resigned to his
doom. Rons had a bad record. Tears
ago he was an inmate of Folsom prison
for burglary under the name of Bert
Holden. He was buried in San Rafael.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Dec. 18.â
"With deliberate tread, Bert Ross, the
niurderer of Deputy Sheriff Ward,,
mounted the scaffold at San Quentin
prison this morning and met hi? dojm.
Ross was perfectly resigned to his
fate. He walked up the thirteen steps
unassisted and as the noose was be
ing placed over his head exclaimed,
"Gcd have mercy upon my soul, a mis
erable sinner."
Very few people witnessed the execu
tion. Ross entered the death chamber
at 10:30 o'clock. He was attended by
the Rev. Father Egan of San Rafael
and Rev. Mr. Drahms, the orison chap
lain. The trap was sprung at 10:23.
Ross fell 5 feet 6 inohes. Durinz his
fall through space Ross clasped his
hands in prayer. After the Jrop his
body moved convulsively. Dr. T. B.
Barney of San Francisco, Dr. Hyde,
the prison surgeon, and Dr. R. F. Casey
of San Francisco pronounced Ross dead
at 10:43. No relative of the condemned
man was present at the execution.

Jews had upheld trie spiritual Idea be
fore the whole world and that the
spiritual is yet to come, but could not
be won by armaments, or by cannon,
but only through and by the soul. He
asked who more than the Jew had
gone forth in the cause of charity?
And, he said, had not the Jew been
handed over to the infuriated popu
lace to murder? Had not the Jew
been handed over as. the sacrifice, and
had he not been blamed for every
body's sins. He asked who more than
the Jew had suffered in this world, yet
who more than he was^ entitled to be
called the servant of the Lord? Chris
tianity, he said, accepted their Bible
and Christianity was founded upon it.

ATTORNEY GENERAL WEBB
GIVES IMPORTANT OPINION
A rumor was revived around the City
Hall yesterday that School Director
Mark intended to resign from his of
fice if he can make sure of appoint
ment by the Board of Education to
the principalship of the Girls' High
School, from which Professor Elisha
Brooks desires to retire. The wise ones
further say that either D. J. Oliver Jr.
or Albert Armstrong is slated by May
or Schmitz ftrr appointment io the va
cancy created by Mark's probable res
ignation. Oliver is an official in the
Order of Woodmen, while Armstrong is
head of classics in the Mission High
School.
Mayor. Schmitz said, when asked as
to the rumor, that he had not heard
of Mark's prospective resignation, nor
had he considered Oliver or Armstrong
as candidates for a School Director
ship. Mark himself laughed at the idea
of his rumored Intention.
The opinion, however, strongly pre
vailed around the offices cf the School
Board that if arrangements could be
made for Mark to succeed Brooks as
principal of the Girls' High School
both would resign their respective po
sitions to consummate the deal. Brooks
stated a month ago that he had no
immediate intention of resigning. It
was paid then that Mark wanted the
place. It Is believed that Brooks will
not sever his connection with the School
Department before the end of the school
term next Junei
There will be another vacant princi
palship to fill as soon as Miss Rose
Thayer, at present principal of the
Chinese Primary School, carries out her
announced intention to resign'her po-
Eltion in the department. Miss Thayer
contemplates an Eastern trip, and her
friends hint that she will extend it to
the matrimonial state.
Among the applicants for the prin
cipalship are Miss M. V. Arnold and
Miss J. E. Greer,' teachers in the Chi
nese Primary School; Miss Martha Gal
loway, teacher in the Cooper Primary;
Mrs. F. Qulnlan, teacher in the Fre
mont Primary, and Miss Agnes Mc-
Laughlin, teacher in the Jefferson Pri
mary. The appointment will not be
made until Miss Thayer has actually
resigned, which she may not do until ,
next month.

Thomas P. Woodward, president of
the Board of Education, presented the
sheepskins and made an address. He
said California was noted for its
production of fine fruits, minerals, etc.,
but that It also raised another distinct
ly different crop â young men and
women. "You people of the Mission,"
he said, "should be proud of this prod
uct you see before you here on the
stage. We have raised this product
through the primary and grammar
schools and later through the High
School, and have turned out into the
world this excellent aggregation of
young folks." He spoke of the un
tiring zeal manifested by the gradu
ates in their course of study and com
mended them on their success.
The programme was as follows:
On the stage sat the graduates, thu
faculty and members of the Board 6t
Education. The stage presented a pret
ty effect with its neatly-gowned girls,
each dressed in white and wearing a
white bow of ribbon in her hair. The
young graduates carried large bunches
of flowers and the platform had the
appearance of a flower garden, rather
than a stage.
< The boy3 were; plainly in the
minority, there being but three of
them. % All of the. graduates' bore a
happy expression, glad that they were
about to be honored for their several
years ' of hard study, happy because
they were about to embark on a career
"of deeper learning, having completed
their academic course of training.
An excellent programme was ren
dered, every number being hailed with
applause. Encores were numerous, the
audience seeming not to tire in the least
of repeated rendition of the fine musi
cal numbers.
The December class of the Mission
High School held its graduating ex
'ercises last night in the High^School
building, on the corner of Dolores and
Eighteenth streets. Eighteen girls and
three boys received their diplomas.
The large auditorium of the school
was crowded to the' doors with an en
thusiastic mass of mothers, fathers,
brother?, sisters and friends of the
young people who have just completed
their high school course. The room was
artistically decorated with a profusion
of ferns, greens and flowers. c

Scholars Delight Large Assemblage.
Flowers In abundance, pretty
sketches on the walls, music in profu
sion and the brightest gatherings char
acterized the 1903 graduating exercises
at the Denman Grammar School yes
terday.
Every student was at her best and
Principal Azro L. Mann was Justly
proud of the manner his pupils acquit
ted themselves throughout the exer
cises.
Miss Mary Pasmore. violinist; Miss
Susan Pasmore, pianist, graduates of
Denman School, and Miss Dorothy
Pasmore, cellist (of the seventh grade),
gave some delightful instrumental se
lections, and Miss Louise Swanberg's
recitation in French revealed a pro
nunciation of the language which was
remarkable for its purity. Miss Swan
berg was rewarded with volleys of ap
plause, having shown quite a dramatic
power in the recital.
The distribution of medals was nat
urally a part of the programme which
was certain to prove of the greatest
interest and as each successful student
came forward and received her honors
from the hands of T. L. Heaton. her
happy schoolmates were ready with an
ovation.
ADDRESS TO SCHOLARS.
The graduating exercises were in the
following order:
Mr. Heaton delivered an address in
which he spoke of the sweet music of
the laughter which he had" often heard
from the girls, which showed the pure
spirit and the pure heart. Mr. Heaton
spoke of the enjoyment that was to be
found In the right activity of the mind,
the mind that was not perverted.
There was, he said, a distinct pleasure
in doing what was right, in devotion to
duty, and he desired to impress the
view that every one must choose the
highest ideal and must not be diverted
by pleasures of a lower standard.
One who sought only his own pleas
ure, he said, got weary of life, but to
the one who had noble purposes, who
sought the spiritual pleasures, content
ment and happiness came and sat day
and night.
Mr. Heaton said that the purpose in
life of all should be to develop them
selves to the utmost In thinking of oth
ers, and though there may be shadows
come across their paths they would be
happy in pursuing that course.
He reminded them that if they found
life worthless it would be their own
fault, for the darkness, he said, was
for those whose eyes were closed and
for those who looked down. Life, too,
was only drudgery if they made It so,
for there was no drudgery only in the
mind of those that conceived it. He
': advised his young friends that when
ever they sav a duty in their path that
had to be performed It were well for
them to make up their mind to enjoy it
by putting into it their whole life and
soul. His experience had made it clear
that only laggards disliked study. In
concluding Mr. Heaton alluded to the
advantages that the students enjoyed
at the Denman School, naming art, lit
erature and music, which he said were
carefully and vigilantly taught by Prin
cipal Mann. He wished the graduates
godspeed through life.
Principal Mann and Miss Jessie Smith
after addressing the graduates were
given an affectionate ovation.

F. W. Dohrmann. as toastmaster, in
troduced the subject of Herder by
some allusion to the life of the great
man whose eminence has been acknowl
edged by the German people by the
raising of a monument at Weimar.
Mr. Dohrmann said that Herder was
poor; he was bom of poor parents, in
a poor province, and his youth was
surrounded by poverty. He upheld
morals and high idea's all his life,
at a time when the Influence of the
courts ol Louis XIV and Louis XV
were felt in Europe. At the age of 15
years he saved from his scanty earn
ings enough to buy candles and books
and he studied at night. Only five
years later, at the age of 21, he had
developed so deeply and widely that
he was the instructor of a prince, which
showed what could be accomplished by
self-denial, determination and a reso- :
lute spirit.
Mr. Dohrmann repeated the judgment
passed by Herder upon Benjamin
Franklin, which reflected light also
upon Herder. The poet considered Ben
Franklin a wonderful man, distin
guished by simplicity, a sense of or
der, clear- insight, naturalness, wit and
humor. Herder's prophecy concerning
the progress of art, science and litera
ture in America was also quoted. Her
der, alluding to Bishop Berkeley's fa
mous prevision, said that the fifth act
of the drama of civilization would be
played in America, and that .it would
be on a hieher plane than the four
preceding acts that had been played in
Europe.
Charles Bundschu prefaced his poem
by saying that Herder's family seal
had the alliterative words "Light, love,
life," upon it, surrounded by an end
less sr.ake in a circle, the symbol of
eternity. On the stoneplate that marks
the soot in Weimar where Herder's re
mains found eternal rest this simple
epitaph has also been inscribed. It
joined In its holy trinity the fundamen
tal harmony of his life, work and ex
istence. Some extracts from Mr. Bund
schu's poern as translated are as fol

were also other musical seceltions. An
anthem was suns by Herr G. Brenner,
with chorus by the company. The two
folk songs previously mentioned were

Mozart, "Bruder Reicht die Hand zum

Herr Brenner sang Schubert's "Erlkoe

The Fan Francisco celebration origi

Stanford I'r.iversity. He early found
cetive co-operation on the part of
Charles Bundschu of this city. A vol
untary committee undertook the task
of organizing B Herder celebration. F.
W. Dohrrnann, one of the regents of
the T'niversity of California, was se-
I^rtei to preside as toastmaster. The
university men were strongly repre
sented, as will appear from the list of
those who were invited to take part.
This list included President David

as follows:
COLLEGE MEN NUMEROUS.
All over the world, last evening.
wherever there is a German city or
<lerrr.r.n colony or any considerable
number of erudite Germans, similar
exercises occurred. The illustrious
Herder shared the rate of myriads of
srreat men who have attempted to do
something beyond the common under
standing. At first he was neglected.
His writings were considered to be
merely ephemera!. Later the great
Goethe, the author of "Faust," the
German Shakespeare, was proud to
mention that he had been a disciple of
Herder. The scope of Herder's mind
became apparent after a time. He was
the son of poor parents. Poverty and
adverse circumstances early drove him
to Introspection and to solitary- com
munion v.ith naturt. and thus favored
a more than proportionate development
ft the sentimental and poetic side of
his mind.
He became renowned as a poet, as a
metaphysician, as a speculative phil
osopher, and has been credited by some
with being the originator of the theory
cf evolution. From this brief reference
It will be teen that his appeal to the
consideration cf posterity is based prin
cipally upon broad German scholar
ship. Naturally enough the leaders in
commemorating his memory all ovtr
the world yesterday were the studious.
With choice German song and with
",-orcs of echolariy appreciation the
one hundredth anniversary of the
Ceatf) of the creat Gorman writer, Jo
hann Gottfried Herder, was observed
in this city last evening. Prominent
German Americans were in attendance.
Thr observance took on the customary
fnm <<f a hanquet v.ith speeches. The
programme was enlivened by songs of
â¢ rorrr.an composers, some of which were
?t? to the. words cf the poet Herder.
The event took place in the rooms of
the Merchants" Club.

at a meeting of the Police Commis

employment bureau and is alleged to
have had a habit of sending men to
people, who did not want them, In or

ing man engaged in a wordy war and
nearly came to blows as a result.

Judge Cabaniss fairly beamed with
thÂ» spirit of holiday beneficence yes
terdav. It was manifested in his own
court* first when two old-timers, Julia
Burns and Jane Donahue, appeared to
answer to charges of vagrancy. The.
two poor old wrecks fully expected
sentences of three months at least in
the County Jail, but the Judge let them
go with a ten-days* sentence, which
under the law will allow their release
Monday. At this unexpected leniency
they fell Into each other's arms and
wept. When they went back to the
prisoners' bench they poured forth a
torrent of thanks upon the merciful
dispenser of justice, and as they were
led away a chorus of "GOd bless you.
Judge" floated back through the cor
riclors. â¢ Then the Judge rushed over
to the court-room of Judge Fritz, who
is ill. and found Mary Donahue there
awaiting judgment for having disturb
ed the peace of her landlady, Mrs. Mc-
Donald, at 120 Eighth street.
Jklary is another old-time offender
that goes on the warpath when she
looks upon the wine. In her mind's eye
she saw the gloomy portals of the
County Jail closing behind her. An
other package of mercy was handed
out, however. Mary was told to go
and sin no more. She promised to find
new lodgings. John Mullins likewise
escaped punishment under the pro
vision that he would take an oath not^
to drink intoxicants for the space . of
one year, which he readily did.
"Remember the night before election, 1
Jedge," asked Mullins after this little
difficulty had been adjusted, "that I
met you on the corner and shook hands
with you?" The Judge remembered.
"At that time, if my recollection serves
me properly, you j 'accompanied your
greeting with the query as to whether
I had the price." added the resourceful
jurist. "Oh, no, Jedge, not that time.
I had money in my pocket that night."
Judge Cabanlss apologized and Mul
lins, taking a glass of water from the
judicial tumbler, went out into the mist*
to battle for a twelvemonth with his
thirst. . â¢

Nor did Mr. Herr believe that thjp
financial system of the university was
either antiquated or defective. No sys
tem could be perfect, he opined, unless
ft is operat<?<l by an honest man under
the supervision of honest men.
In the fixinsr of blame for McKowen's
defalcation the auditor does not spare
the scholarship donors who made their
checks payable to him personally, in
5tf-ad of following the usual course of
sending the money to the treasurer and
obtaining his receipt for it.. As the gen
eral fund is thus placed in the hands
of the treasurer, and is thoroughly
safeguarded, Mr. Herr does not believe
that McKowr-n pilfered any of that
fund, but confined his -stealings exclu-
Fively to the scholarship and fellow
ship moneys and;mcdical school fees.- *
â¢ But that theory d^es not explain how
McKowen managed -to pay .in the
scholarship and .fellowship funds "as
they became due and still contrived tb
embezzle at least $20,000. . -,
The auditor's last report was submit
ted to the finance committee on Jan
uary. 2f>, 1903. and it approved all the
books and vouchers examined by him.
But It has been ascertained that Mc-
Kowen presented no account of the
scholarship cr fellowship funds or the
medical college fees, so that the audi
tor, had no opportunity to ascertain
whether those items of income had
been honestly handled.
It has been discovered, also, that the
auditor repeatedly expressed a desire
to examine the university accounts
every three months instead of once a
year, and that he had been prevented
doing so by McKov.en pleading inabil
jtr to have his books ready for inspec
tion.
Yet the auditor never suspected that
McKowen was dishonest, but attrib
uted hif delay in getting ready for in
spection to the. fact that he kept all the
bonks himsolf Instead of intrusting the
task or any share of It to a subordi
nate.
Auditor J. J. Herr's arrival from L03
Angeles was one. of yesterday's inter
esting developments in the investiga-"

en's wholesale embezzlement of State
University funds. For many years Mr.
Herr has audited the secretary's ac
counts and reported his findings to the
finance committee of the Board of Re-;
gents, and it was confidently expected
that his presence at the university,
would serve to bring Â£o light the exact
amount of McKowen's peculations and
his method of pilfering. But from those
two very Important points there has
been no lifting of the haze by Mr. Herr.
Accompanied by President Wheeler
End Chairman of the Finance Commit
tee Foster, the auditor spent about
two hours inspecting the books at
which Norman McLaren and his assist
ant are so. industriously probing, but
at the conclusion of the inspection Mr.
Herr's report was a repetition of the
old story: â¢ â¢ â¢
"We must wait for the findings of the
experts."
From his cursory examination, how
ever, the auditor \ras inclined to be
lieve that McKowen's total shortage
Trill not turn out to be as much as $40,

McKowen's own estimate of $20,000 is.
according to Mr. Herr's opinion, nearer

The new lime works on the Bear
River, three miles from Coif ax, so says
the Colfax Sentinel, are nearly com
pleted. The burning, kilns have a .ca
pacity of from 100 to 125 barrels of lime
daily. The rock from the quarries has
undergone a thorough test. The Sen
tinel says the quarries are virtually
inexhaustible and the suply of fuel
abundant. The company has surveyed
for an aerial tramway to convey the
lime from the kilns to the top of the
hill, above the works, which isy a dis
tance of 2800 feet, on a gradual upward
Incline, and the elevation . from the
kilns to the end of the tramway is 605
feet. The tramway will intersect the
wagon road a short distance from the
Big Oak mine, and from there the lime
will be hauled by teams to Colfax, via
the county road. Electricity will be
used as the motive power on. the tram
way. A storage supply for the lime
will be erected at the works with a ca
pacity of 100 tons. Colfax will be the
distributing point for the northern part
of the State of Nevada.
A correspondent of the Calaveras
Prospect writes that the mining
outlook has never, before , been
as good for the Calaveritas district.
The Nelson Contracting Company is
working. The debris dams are com
pleted and awaiting the inspection of
the California Debris Commission. The
Foster claim, near Washington ranch,
will be operated. A dredger to work
gravels will probably be constructed.
Work at Brandy Flat will be on quite
a large scale this winter.
The Murphys correspondent of the
Calaveras Chronicle writes that the
| various mines In the Immediate sur
rounding are pushing developments and
erecting necessary improvements to fa
cilitate progress. Superintendent
Stone at the Red Gold mine, one of the
Buckhorn group, has men at work, in
the mine and on top, with a view to
the speedy production of bullion. At
the Mayday tunnel, which is located
not far distant from the Red Gold, ex
plorations are under way. The Forty-
Nine mine at Douglass Flat has no
trouble to keep out the water, and
everything Is progressing favorably
toward reaching gravel.
The old Southwestern tunnel is to be
again opened by Fred Orth & Co. this
winter. For years the tunnel has been
permitted to rest, while the adjoining
property was worked by the present
company and others. This tunnel
pierced the old Central Hill channel
lately worked by Thomas, Bisbee and
McCormick.
In a collection of mining facts relat

Ysabel has reached a depth of 280 feet.
Five more stamps are being placed in
the mill at the Vine Springs. Operations
will begin at the Mount Lily Monday.
The Homestake, near the Eagle-Shaw
mut, has been bonded to a Scottish

The Sierraville Record says that the
mining industry in the Meadow Lake
mining district of Eastern Nevada
County continues brisk and promising.
For the first time in many years min
ing will be carried on this year through

the ten-stamp mill will not be used
until the snow leaves nex,t. spring, but
the men will continue to work in the
mine, which is 140 feet deep. It is ex
pected that a large amount of ore will
be got out ready for milling during the
winter. A large amount of provisions
has been taken into the mining camp.
There is three feet of snow between

plans are now being worked out for a
consolidation of the Mountaineer and
Summit mines, which will mean much
for the future of Nevada City. J. C.
Campbell has been at work for sev
eral weeks past organizing a company
to control the two properties. The
Summit is owned chiefly by Charles
Webb Howard of the Spring Valley
Water Company. It Is stated that the
proposition is to run a tunnel from
Deer Creek to drain off the surface wa
ter from the Summit and to connect
the two properties. The work of pump-
Ing out the Mountaineer is now under
way. -
The triple compartment shaft at the Eureka-
Woodslde mine in v this place Is down about
90 feet. A pump to handle the water In the
shaft will be installed.
Operations have beeiy resumed on the Ida
Mitcholl mine, in the heart of Placervllle.
Men were put to work on the shaft. * D. H.
Jackson intends to thoroughly prospect ; the
property before putting up a mill.
work. There is a general closing down
of small placer mines owing to the
weather in Siskiyou County. .
The Placervllle Democrat tells of
work in the mines fn El Dorado County
as follows:
A Hve-etamp mill Is being constructed at
Morey"s foundry for the Witmer & Fuller
mine.
Work is being pushed forward on the triple
compartment ehaft at the Darling mine.
j some recent â¢moves for the develop
.â¢ ment of that mineralized section is
given by the Redding Free Press. That
paper says that there is a great stir,
which is felt in Redding, the principal
supply ' point. A new 175-ton smelter
is being installed at the Afterthought
mine, near Ingot. The second furnace
of the De La Mar smelter is about
ready to be blown in. It will be work
ing early in January. The Mountain
Copper Company is running full hand
ed and Is treating about 26,000 tons 'of
ore per month. The plant is being
gradually improved and enlarged. The
Mountain Copper Company emplc/ys in
mine, smelter and railroad 1200 men,
approximately. .The Guggenhimes are
reported by the Free Press to be nego
tiating for the Mammoth mine, which
is near the Kennet property. In case
the Guggenhimes take the property
Shasta County would have its fourth
smelter operating. The Free Press says:
ThÂ© Quartz Hill StMwater and Old Dig
gings districts contain many small mines
that are taking out and shipping ore to the
Keswlck smelter The mineral output of
Shasta County for 1901 was $8,737,571. For
1902 the strike and shut-downs brought It
down to S3.730.O49. This year the output
will be about the same as the strike con
tinued until May and the Mountain Copper
smelter did not get in full running order
for a couple of months later.
Next year with everything running In full
blast there 'is no reason why Shasta should
not send out $10,000,000 in mineral wealth to
the markets of the world. The copper belt
produces nearly all of this vast wealth. Red
ding Is the business center, and the least
enthusiastic predicts that in two years' time
Redding's population will be doubled.
IX SISKIYOITS MIXES.
In other sections of California that
are not affected by labor troubles pro
gress is being made in the mining in
dustry. The Scott Valley Advance says
that with the opening of spring many
properties that have been known only
as prospects will be opened. The King
Solomon mine in SIskiyou County will
have 100 men at work if the prospect
tunnel strikes the body of ore. A large
amount of machinery will be placed in
the Black Bear property. The Medina
Company, operating the Gardner and
Eastlick mines at Oro Flno, Is pre
paring to add largely to its plant. A
fifty-ton cyanide plant is promised. The
Siskiyou Mining and Development Com
pany has begun to pump out the per
pendicular shaft which has partly
filled. One hundred and fifty tons of
coal were taken out from the incline
shaft to do the necessary development
the Investigation and finally evokes the
old answer:
"We must wait for the findings of
the experts."
It has been surmised that the secre
tary used one scholarship fund to pay
another-^operated a sort of endless
chainâ and that his total, defalcation,
whatever it may turn out to be. will
be found to have been taken from one,
or may be two, of the heaviest schol
arship or fellowship donors. McKowen
had direct and untrammeled access to
about 5440.C00 from these sources. When
any of the university folks are asked
to state how many of the donors sent
their checks to McKowen personally
the inevitable reply comes:
"We must wait for the findings of the
experts." .
Considerable confusion has been cre
ated among the students by the "hold
ing up" of their rebates, with all other
bills owing by the university except
those for labor. Pupils in the chemi
cal, â¢ physical -and mining laboratories
deposited with Secretary \ McKowen
sums ranging 'from' ?1 to $25 each to
secure the "university against dam
age to any! of the apparatus used by
them in their various experiments, and
now at the end of. the term, with the
holiday vacatlon'-on hand, they are un
able to collect their rebates. McKow
en Issued' vouchers for these deposits,
but -the J vo*uchers- will not be indorsed
until the experts' have concluded their
examination -of .., the secretary's ac
counts,- unless the â¢ treasurer i so ar
range^ It .that the boys, and: girls can
,Vet their- money, before they go home
â¢for the holidays..
AS TQ THE DEFENSE.
Attorney Wright, who has been re
tained with'Peter F^Dunneto protect
{-McKowen's interests while that person
j is in' jail, stated yesterday that he has
| not yet consulted Mr. Dunne as to what
t the line of defense will be. .
[" "Indeed," said Mr' 'Wright,- "we are
I not certain that any defense will be
i offered. Mr. McKowen himself does
i not seem anxious to* put up a defense,
j and It is' probable Uiat a plea' of guilt
will be entered. Nothing will be defi
nitely decided, however, until the book
keeping experts:'' have concluded their
.Work and the regents take^ action." '
Meantime, the self-confessed embez
zler dwells In the Alameda County Jail
and resolutely declines. to discuss his
case 'with 'any* except his Invited vis
itcfrs. One of- these is .WV H. 'Smyth of.
Berkeley, ""the "man" who"took him to his
home when he was a miserable sailor
lad and treated him ' as a son, obtain
ing. for him the humble position' in the
university from which he rose to the
secretaryship. McKo wen's conversa
tions with Mr. Smyth are strictly con
fidential.
IS THERE A "PLANT"?
Among the reports current yesterday
In Oakland was one to the effect that
McKowen did not squander as much
money on the race track as he alleged,
and that the greater part of his pilfer
ings is "planted" somewhere. In sup
port of this idea was advanced the
argument that such select legal lumin
aries as Peter F. Dunxe and Harry M.
Wriglit could not be retained for . a
song, and that the prisoner has -no
moneyed friends to back his defense.
McKowen sturdily maintains that he is
penniless, since he deeded his three lots
and personal belongings to the uni
versity.
Governor Par dee has called a meet
ing of the Board of Regents for. this
afternoon at the Hopkins Institute.
While the McKowen affair will prob
ably be discussed, none of the Regents
expect that anything of a definite
character, will or. can be done k in the
matter until the mystery inclosed In the
eecretary's books is solved. But it is
just possible that r the financial system
which enabled McKowen to conduct
his peculations unchecked and undis
covered for a period extending over
half a dozen years will be inquired into
and Borne amendments suggested.
Activity is manifested on the copper
belt of Shasta County. An account of
Judging from appearances In Judge
Mogan's courtroom yesterday the
storm center of San Francisco labor
troubles at present seems to be in
front of the Golden Gate Cloak House
on Market street, near Taylor, owned
by.M, Slniinoff.. The street in front of
the place was blocked by a multitude
Thursday, night listening to rival sets
of shouters, one proclaiming that the
house was "unfair" and warning all
good men -not : to purchase therein,
while the other set maintained in loud
tones that the house was "fair" and
worthy of patronage. Out in the mid-'
die of the street a "sandwich man"
bore a banner /with the announcement
that the cloak house was "unfair."
Sergeant Mahoney and asquad'vain^
ly endeavored to clear the way for
traffic and as a final recourse arrested
all the "spielers" and the "sandwich
man." When the case was called- in
court it was a matter of great difficulty
to separate the different factions , so
that the various witnesses could iden
tify them to the satisfaction of the at
torneys and Judge Mogan. Finally the
Judge solved the problem by getting
the "fair" howlers to sit in the lower
seats of the jury box, while the "un
fair" clacquers were lined up against
the wall. The "sandwich man," who
bore the appropriate name of Eaton
and was in a class by himself, was
stationed at the railing. ' Then the tak
ing of testimony began.
It developed that Slminoff, proprietor
of the cloak house, as an. offset to the
denunciation of the union pickets who
proclaimed his house "unfair." had
hired a crew of stentorian-toned shout
ers to howl down the strikers. Both
sides were making all the noise they
could and the "sandwich man" carried
the banner .and made more noise than
anybody. The "fair" shouters occupied
the sidewalk, the "unfair" men lined up
on the curb and the "sandwich man"
tramped the street. Edgar Peixotto,
attorney for Siminoff, admitted that his
clients were probably guilty of disturb
ing the peace ! and thought that the
strikers' were also. Â¦ _.<.
He believed that the officers had done
their duty in making the arrests. The
attorneys on the other side were.un
willing to admit as much for their cli
ents. Judge Mogan reserved decision
In the case, but he warned the warring
factions that they must keep the side
walk clear and not interfere with traf
fic and said that if this were not done
he would severely punish any member
of either 'Tair" or "unfair" shouters
that came before him in the future.

any statement, "Well, I would like to
get out, of this. Judge," he answered.
"You can hardly be callr^i daringly
original in your desire," commented the
court. Kelley Is accused of snatching
53 from the hand of James Sample, who
was counting his money at the corner
of Mission and Third streets on Decem
ber 17. A policeman saw the theft, pur
sued and captured the robber and re
covered the money.
Thomas Sutton is certainly playing in
hard luck. He was among the drunks
before Judge Conlan yesterday. "How
about this, Sutton?" asked the Judge.
v"It was this way, your Honor," said
the prisoner. "I work for\ the Haslett
Warehouse Company. Yesterday I was
piling -firebrick all day and was tired.
After I quit work I took a couple of
drinks of whisky. I am not In the habit
of drinking anything, and the liquor
must have gone to my head. I guess I
was pretty full, but it is the fir^f. time
I have been that way In years." It
looked like a runaway race for Sutton.
"What were you doing up on Kearny
street, near Market, late in the after
noon?" asked the Judge. '.'Me?" said
Sutton. "I wasn't up that way at all."
"Oh*, yes, you were," said the Judge. "I
saw you there myself. You were curs
ing horribly and trying to load a big
box into a hack and drive off with it.
When the hackman interfered you fair
ly flowed with profanity. I said then
that you would be before me pretty
soon, and here you are. I!U sentence
you to-morrow." Now, If Conlan had
been on Ellis streetâ but what's the
use of a man arguing about an unto
ward fate?
John Guinasso knocked down Kitty
Langford Thursday night on Pacific
street and took $3 away from her. She
screamed for helr>, and two men that
went to her assistance were also
knocked down. Guinasso was convict
ed of disturbing the peace before Judge
Conlan yesterday and ordered into cus
tody pending a further investigation
into the case. It Is probable that a
charge of robbery will also be placed
against him.
Thomas S. Wall, a machinist, was be
fore Judge Conlan yesterday charged
with battery. The testimony showed
that Ethel Roberts, a young girl, re
fused .to live with her mother and took
a room at 502 Third street. Her mother
went there with some food for her
while Wall was making a call. The
mother upbraided him for inducing the
girl to leave home, and as a result Wall
choked the mother. Her screams at
tracted Policeman Whelton, who at
tempted to place Wall under arrest.
Wall gave the policeman such a tough
battle that Whelton was ' compelled to
call in the assistance of Policeman Mc-
Dowell before the machinist could be
subdued. The hearing of the case was
continued until to-day.

RECOVERS JUDGMENT
FROM GERMAN BASK
A suit in ejectment Â»V33 filed yester
day In the United States Circuit Court,
Ninth Division, against Bowman H.
McCalla. commander of the naval sta
tion at Mare Island. The suit has been
brought by E. K Sawyer and i3 in
reality a suit against the United States
Government to recover 154.55 acres of
swamp and overflow land off the north
end of Mare Island.
Sawyer claims title under the grant
by Congress in 1S50 of all swamp and
overflow lands to the State of Califor
nia. In 1S57 the State patented the
land in question to David N. Darllnton.
Sawyer is the successor of Darlinton in
the ownership of the land, and wants
the Government ejected from what he
alleges is his by right of law.
It .being 1 unlawful to bring suit
against the Government without hav
ing first secured its consent, .the suit
was brought against McCalla. he being
In charge of and ruler over the island,

suit filed.
The United States Government will la

ing Mare Island in Us entirely as suc
cessor to Victor Castro, to whom the
Island was granted by the Mexican
Government In 1S41. The Government
is in possession of the tract of over
flowed land at the present time.
Sawyer claims that the Government
in acquiring the island only got the
high land and that the swamp or over
flowed land belonged to the State by
the grant of 1830. He being, the succes
sor of Darlinton, to whom the land was
patented by the State, claims title to
the disputed acreage.
The suit v.ill occasion much interest.
as a case similar to it was brought
against the Government in the Circuit
Court befora Chief Justice Field in Sep
tember, 1833, by the San Francisco
Savings Union et al. to secure title to
a large tract of overflowed land com
prising 7413 acres. The land then sued
for was that lying directly north of the
section now being sued for by Sawyer.
Judge Field gave Judgment to the
plaintiff. The decision was appealed to
the United States Court of Appeals and
there upheld.
Sawyer claims that the Government
is now using his tract of submerged

mony was a part of the Christmas
jinks and was in the nature of a bap
tism, because the faculty has hereto
fore frov.ned on such playfulness. Last
year the jinks was eschewed and on
the first holiday they had the students
buried thpir woes with solemn cere
monies. This year the faculty permit
ted the frolic and the committee se
lected the birth cf "joy and good fel
lowship" as a fitting theme for their
jinks.
High Minister Keane resembled a
cozy comer as he stood In the impro
vised pulpit. He spoke in doleful tones
and the responses from the student
congregation were very fervent. All
nationalities composed the congrega
tion. The students were costumed and
the scene was one of colc-r and anima
tion. From the walls were suspended
branches of trees studded with red
cajidies and held in place by clay that
resembled snow. Above the pulpit was
a bit of sculpture by Robert Aitken.
The painter, sculptor and architect
were shown in allegorical form and
above the figures was one of the Ma
donna holding a child. The entire work
is of clay and yet If the sculptor car
ried out the scheme and placed it in
more enduring substance it would add
to his fame.
Throughout the mock services the
students sang hymns and offered up
thanks to the faculty. The offspring
was dressed as "Toto" in the burlesque
of "Zaza." He disturbed the services
by outlandish yells that had to be sub
dued by the entire ccrnjrregatlon.
After the baptism the students sat
down to a feast that consisted of char
lotte russe, tarts, icecream and pickles.
During the feast Thomas A. McGlynn.
who was master of ceremonies, pre
sented a vaudeville show. Mis3 Mau
riel Roberts. Miss Lillian Clark. Miss
Marie Odegard and Miss Vivian Juarez
fang dialect songs; Miss Christine La
Barraque. a blind girl with a' magnifi
cent voice, rendered two songs In fault
less style; Miss Riechelmen sang. Miss
Hector played a selection on the piano
and Theodore Keane gave a funny bur
lesque of a slack wire performer.
The students then adjourned to the
big hall where the antiques are kept
and danced the afternoon away. The
grand march brought out frisky wid
ows, lassies, cowgirls, Indians, danc
ing girls and maids and lads of every
description.

and when he gees the ballots cast in
the Fourth Congressional District of
California in the last general election
will go with him. The HousevOf Repre
sentatives, having the Kahn-Livernash
contest on its hands, want3 to see the
real ballots. The order for the ballots
does not emanate from the sub-com
mittee or the main committee, but it
comes from the House itself.
Many of the so-called clever politi
cians remark that Congress will be dis
appointed, as the law of California pro
vides ffcat the ballots must be de
stroyed after a limited period of time,
but these wise politicians do not know 1
why Judge Dibble gave so much atten
tion to affairs of state at Sacramento
last winter. It now transpires that he
caused the introduction of an amend
ment to section 1255 of the Political
Code. The amended law was approved
February 26, 1903.
As amended the law stands as fol
lows:
"Provided, further, that if in any-
Congressional district within this State
there has been or shall be filed a con
test of the election of any person de
clared to have been elected a member
of Congress, and the County Clerk or
Registrar of Voters in any county or
city and county be notified by the con
testant that such Congressional elec
tion contest Is pending, then and in
that case such County Clerk or Regis
trar of Voters shall not destroy the bal
lots in that county or city and county,
or in the part or portion thereof within
such Congressional district in which
such contest Is pending, until the final
determination of such contest before
the House of Representatives of the
Congress of the United States; and
such County Clerk or Registrar of Vot
ers shall hold such ballots In his cus T
tody subject to the Inspection of any
committee of the House cf Representa
tives or sub-committee thereof having
In charge the investigation of such con
test, and shall. produce such ballots for
examination before any such commit
tee of the House of Representatives or
sub-committee, or by any commission
er designated by such Congressional

Martin Richter, whose position was
! that of assistant manager in the offices
â of the Swiss Marine Insurance Com
pany, at 315 California street, ended his
life yesterday afternoon with a bullet.
The suiefde occurred in a small store
room on the third floor of the building
occupied by the concern and was wit
nessed by no one. What prompted
Richter to destroy his life is a mystery,
and the manager of the company re
fuses to talk. Illness is given as a pos
sible cause, but a letter left by tho un
fortunate man to his wife contain3
statements that lead the police to be- j
lieve that money troubles may be in- !
volved.
It was soon after 2 o'clock yesterday
afternoon when occupants of the build
ing heard a muffled report on the third
Cocr. The noise was unheeded at the
time, but fifteen minutes later Thoma3
Sullivan, who Is employed on the prem
ises, opened the storeroom dcor and
beheld a body lying across a table In
front of him. Hastening to the inani
mate form he turned it over and found
it to be that of Richter, and a revolver I
fell from the grarp of the stiffened fin- I
gers. Help from the insurance office
below was summoned and the police '
department notified.
Detectives Mulcaby and O'Dea an- j
swered the call and questioned Louis
Rorenthal, who is the local agent of the
company. Rosenthal seemed reluctant
to talk, and endeavored to keep a let- I
ter which had been found in the pos- ;
session of the dead man and which \
wa3 addressed to his wife. The only
information the detectives could secure !
was that Richter left the offices some !
time before he killed himself, saying ;
nothing to any one and giving no inti- |
mation that he contemplated such a
deed.
DEFENDS DEAD JLVV. r
Rosenthal said that Richter was ill
and that his accounts were all straight,
but could ascribe no reason for the act.
When Questioned later in the day the
agent said that the details o? the sui
cide would have to be learned else
where than from his office. He will be
summoned before the Coroner and will
be asked under oath to tell all he
knows.
The letter that was written by Rich
ter to his wife speaks of a "sorrow"
which he could not impart to her. It
was penned in the Swiss language and
translated Is as follows:
SAN" FRAN'CISCO. D-c. IS. 15C3.
My l>ar. Good Louise: Whatever I did I
had to iio. I am rick through sorrows that I
could never Impart to you. We have lived hap
pily together for more than twenty-three years.
and you have done eieryiklni? that one could do
to make life agreeable to me. If I lÂ»avÂ° you
now. f.irgrlve me. but I could not live thrcugh
It. Unfortunately. I have rtthins to leave to
you. The Htt!fÂ» yea have saved up and our
household effects, tor which ycur savings are
al?o respcnslbt*, are all that remains to you.
After you havÂ« once lived through the first sor
rows I know that my Louise will gather up
enough, courage to take heart and with all her
good qualities to live on contentedly. If not
quite eo happily.
Farewell, good Louise, and forgive me who
certainly always meant for your b*st.

MAXAGSD PLANTATION".
Richter was a native of Germany i
and about 56 years of age. He resided
with his wife at 539 Clayton street. â¢
They had no children. He was a man- !
ager of a sugar plantation in Hawaii Â¦
for many years, but came to this city ;
about eleven years ago and secured |
employment in the offices of Gutte & j
Frank, insurance agents at 303 Califor- !
nta street. On July 18 he severed his â¢
connection with this firm, saying that
he had secured a better position with '
Rosenthal. Gutte says that so far as
he knows the.re was nothing wrong .
with Richter's accounts, but since news j
of the suicide reached him an investi- \
gatlon will be commenced at once. At i
the time Richter left for his new place
a highly complimentary letter was
given him and was found in his posses
sion yesterday.
Mrs. Richter knows of no reason why
her husband should have killed himself j
except ill-health. He has been suffer- i
Ing from stomach and kidney troubles !
for some time past, but never men- !
tloned a desire to die. He left home
yesterday morning in a cheerful mood I
and at noon rang/ his wife up on the !
telephone, as was his habit, telling her
he was at lunch and suggesting things
that he would like for dinner. Three i
'hours later the news of his death was
conveyed to her. :

Japan, it is said, intends now to bring her affairs with
Russia to a crisis and to take a determined stand in
reference to what: she deems her rights in the
question. It is high time that she should do so. She
has played fast and loose with Korea long enough to
suggest to her statesmen that playing with fire is a
dangerous thing unless there are some sure, and high
stakes in the balance.
Recently The Call has published signed articles from
men officially connected with the citrus fruit shippers
of the south and the California fruit distributers of the
northern and central counties. Therein the. methods
that are in vogue were fully described. Much informa
tion of value was given to the people of the State by
those most intimately connected with co-operation in
marketing orchard products.
The almond growers have been successfully working
together in at least one portion of the-State during the
past season. Reports that have been submitted seem to
indicate that advantage has been reaped as the result
of joint action. A meeting of 'the Almond 'Growers', As
sociation of the Davisville district * was held last week
at Davisville. An /account of the proceedings is pub
lished by the Woodland Democrat President La Rue
and J. W. Anderson, secretary of the association, re
ported that the season just, closed was satisfactory to

THE producers of California are coming together
more and more for mutual benefit and protectio'n.
There are associations of large size representative
of the interests of the growers of citrus fruits, deciduous
fruits, raisins, dried fruits and other products. The-in
terest of the California growers is necessarily strong in
the progress of co-operation as applied to the marketing
of the output of orchards, vineyards and farms.
PRODUCERS COME TOGETHER.
Another inspiration has been given to the rapidly
growing prosperity, of San Mateo' by 'the commencement
of work on the railroad which will equip her with needed
transportation facilities from bay to ocean. The Southern
Pacific Company will realize soon, perhaps, that San
Mateo is a natural suburb of San Francisco and de
serves the same concessions in train service which have
been given to the various bay cities. Or perhaps some
other company may teach the Southern Pacific this
costly lesson.
ANY ONE doubting the loyalty to alma mater re
puted to exist in the 1 heart of every college-bred
man will find a hard argument to overcome in
the projected centennial gift of $1,000,000 to be made.to
the old University of Vermont by her loyal sons upon
the occasion of her one hundredth birthday, which oc
curs next year. Already one-tenth of that sum has been
subscribed by two of her alumni, and by the time that
the centennial celebration ceremonies are due it is ex
pected the enormous endowment will be handed over to
the trustees of the university complete.;
Though not included among the greater universities
of the country; the university of the Green Mountain
State has a roll of gradyates of which it may be justly
proud. A Vice President of the United_ States, a Cabi
net member, over twenty members of - Congress and
many names high' in, the roster of the army and navy
have been among its graduates. During the war of
1812 its graduation class was reduced to jtwo members,
and again in the Civil War the total number for the
four years was less' than twenty, but the stanch old col
lege has survived each shock with renewed spirit, and
with the centennial endowment in its coffers it may
enter upon a new and broader career. ' -

A SUBSTANTIAL BIRTHDAY GIFT.
A sigh of relief like the murmur of myriad voices in
thanksgiving passed over the country the other day
when the wires flashed the message that the Maine
had made the voyage from Colon to New York without
a single mishap. No one had been killed, no one was
even injured, and the cruiser steamed proudly into the
â¢harbor to have her engines repaired. Let our foreign
friends scoff no more at our fighting ships.
Senators' Baggage,
The Senators know how to live. They
see to it that their deliberations are"
carried on unvexed by the absence of
anything that could contribute to their
happiness and comfort. They have
been taking the regular account of
stock, and from the articles in the Sen
ate's committee rooms and warehouses
a good sized department store might
be stocked.
Among these aids to legislation are
forty-four bottles of cologne, a lemon
squeezer, a bottle of tonic, seventy-two
funeral regalias, seven burned out elec
tric fans, 101 small glasses (probably
for lemonade), eight batn brushes, two
air cushions, two cakes of shaving soap,
three coalhods, seventy-two cases of
hygienic soap, a pair of white blan
kets, a half gallon copper measure,
twenty-three tincups, a formaldehyde
generator, a. "suit case," five bottles o*
salts, and violet, white rose, Jocfce/
Club -arid other fancy soaps.
Unsinkable Ship.
The long sought goal of naval archi
tects, an unsinkable ship, has been
reached in the steamer Kaiser Wilhelm
II, officials of the North German Lloyd
line declare. They say the vessel is
so constructed that no matter what
accident may occur to her an auto
matic device makes it practically Im
possible for her to fill and sink.â and
absolutely safeguards the lives of her
passengers. This is accomplished by a
number of water-tight bulkheads,
which can be closed by the officer on
the' bridge of the vessel in thirty sec
onds.
The shiD Is first protected with a
double bottom, but she has besides six
teen transverse bulkheads, and a longi
tudinal one separating the engine
rooms, which are so planned that even
If two adjoining ones should be flooded
the vessel would float. Wherever the
operation c-f the-vessel makes necessary
doors in the bulkheads, as at the coal
bunkers, doors are arranged, geared to
a water main, so that at a touch from
the officer in charge of the ship they
can be instantly shut by hydraulic
pressure. The water malm which Is
filled with a non-f reezable compound,
is kept at a pressure of 800 pounds to
the sauare inch and the force which
closes the doors is so great that It will
drive them shut through the coal or
other matter which sometimes blocks
them. The doors can also be operated
by hand from the deck above, although
the tanks and engines which control
them are placed out of danger of any
possible injury. The system is known
as the Stone-Lloyd, and has been put
on all the passenger ships of the com
pany.-New York Tribune.
Chaining Lightning.
Professor Hans Molisch of Pragma
has reported to the Vienna Academy of
Sciences the discovery of a lamp lighted
by means of bacteria, which he claims
will give a powerful light and be free
from danger, thus being valuable for
work in mines and powder magazines.
The lamp consists of a glass Jar In
which a lining of saltpeter and gela
tine, inoculated with bacteria, is placed.
Two days after inoculation the Jar be
comes illuminated with a wonderful
bluish-green light, caused by the In
numerable bacteria which have devel
oped In the time. The light will burn
brilliantly for from two to three weeks,
afterward diminishing in brightness. It
renders faces recognizable at a distance
of two yards and large type Is easily
legible by it. Professor Molisch asserts
that the lamp yields a cold light, which
is entirely safe.

Philippine Facts. >
The Philippine Islands have a gen
eral coast line of about 11,44*4 statute
miles, or double that of the main part'
of the T 'r.lted States, while the total
area Is 115,026 square miles, or less than
that of New Mexico. There is a mile
of coast line to every ten miles of area,
while in the United States the propor

Crow for London.
England had its Boer war and is now

indicates that crow will be the Christ

Dr. White entertained a party of pro
fessors and students at his home the
other evening with t & delightful talk
based upon his diplomatic experiences
In Europe, says the Ithaca Journal. The
party was composed of members of
the faculty of department of history
and political science and about a dozen
students, who are specializing in the
department.
Dr. White discussed life in St. Peters
burg and Berlin from the diplomat's
point of view, and the great issues
that turn upon seemingly trivial inci
dents or motives. He dwelt upon the
disadvantage at which the American
Embassadors are placed by reason of
the fact that the United States does
not provide residences for its envoys.
He related several interesting Inci
dents. When he arrived In Berlin as
Embassador to Germany he found it
customary for newly appointed envoys
to give three great receptions to the
diplomatic corps and Influential offi
cials, and these functions must be held
in a private apartment, never in a ho
tel. He was lucky enough to find a
suitable apartment, though this was by
no means certain beforehand, but
when he came to furnish the house his
difficulties began.
The shops of Germany keep only
small stocks of furniture, manufactur
ing mostly from samples. Consequent
ly he was compelled to go from Berlin
to Dresden, and finally to Paris and
London, before he finished the furnish
ing of his residence. The needed re
pairs and rearrangement consumed
some time, and the day of the first re
ception arrived without the completion
of the work. He stood over the arti
sans with his watch in his hand, and
only ordered the rooms cleared five
minutes before the first Installment of
guests arrived.
Later the entire house, of which he
had only an apartment, was bought
out from under him by the country of
Baden for its representative in Berlin,
though the latter, as Dr. White put it,
"was so far below the American Em
bassador in diplomatic rank that an
opera glass would have been necessary
to distinguish him."

The Chinese are abandoning the

Francisco and the colonies, helped as
fpr as Honolulu by a smaller vessel to
take off some of the burden of the ex
clusive island trade; not less than six
great lines carry' freight and passen

When the Isthmus of- Panama Is
pierced,"' cutting off 10,000 : miles of sail
ing distance between the Pacific ports
of America and the great Commercial
centers of the world, a tremendous im
petus will be given to the carrying
trade of the western ocean.'
Apparently the. commerce of the Pa
cific has been of slow growth: In fact,
it has seemed to become of great im
portance only since the Spanish War.
But far-seeing men the world over did
not need the sound of Dewey's guns
to awaken them to a perception of the
future trend of trade. The Spanish
War resulted in putting the United
States in the most advantageous possi
ble position with reference to the com
merce of the Pacific, and with the key
in possession of this country- it Is not
difficult to see that this commerce will
fall more and more into American con
trol as the years go on. /it has not
been so many years since one small
steamship iine from San Francisco to
the colonies off Australia and New Zea
land, and another to" Asia, Â« with "a
coastwise line to Panama and smaller
coastwise lines along the western part
of this country, sufficed for the bulk .of
the carrying trade on the Pacific, al
though, of course, there was in addition
to this the island sugar fleet and the
big wind jammers carrying the Cali
fornia wheat crop from San Francisco
to Liverpool. On the Asiatic side a
fleet of slow junks crept up and down
along the Chinese coast, running their
noses far iip into the rivers, but count
ing for nothing in the commerce of the
world.
* ,'- â¢ - ?
Following the Great Circle trade
route from the Isthmus of Panama to
Hongkong and Manila, it will be found
that the United States, starting at one
end of the route and ending at the
other, has a position of such vantage
as no other nation can hope to equal.
The only possible rival,' in fact, is
Japan, and the Japanese, contrary to
the generally accepted notion, are not
a'maritime people. The Japanese live
on islands, it is true, and have always
been boatmen, but they are boatmen,
merely, fishermen and not sailors. The
only line of Japanese ships trading
across the Pacific to-day is officered by
Englishmen, and the Japanese do not
make the best sailors even under for
eign command. They, are Inferior to
the Chinese, and not to be compared
to the Manila men. In fact, it is an
aphorism among, sea captains along
the Asiatic coast, that when a Japan
ese steamer comes along it behooves
everybody else in the neighborhood to
get out of the way, for the Japanese
skipper needs all the sea room there
is â and some more. A nation of bad
sailors never becomes really commer
cially great. Note, in this connection,
the difference between the French and
the English.
As the trade of the world stands
now and has stood since the decline
of Venice, England occupies precisely
the best business stand on earth. Ma
cauley once said something like that,
without the added truth that nations
change, and the routes of commerce
change with changing conditions. With
reference to the commerce of the fu
ture, the United States holds the key
of the Pacific and occupies in addition
the* best stands for business on both
sides of the world's coming trade high-,
way.
The Pacific is the ocean of the fu
ture. Upon its waters there is des
tined to grow up, within the present
century, the world's greatest com
merce, and the nation that holds the
key to the Pacific will become the
world's greatest commercial nation-
Men who see far have seen this for a
long time past. The lands that border
the Atlantic are old lands, destined to
slow growth, while the Pacific lands
are new, with their natural resources
hardly yet touched, or old lands only
just beginning to feel the awakening
touch of modern commercial progress.
The Pacific Ocean is the ocean of the
future and the key of the Pacific is
the Isthmus of Panama.

Future of Pacific Trade.
AT this season of the year there-are many appeals to
the people of San Francisco for assistance to the
charitable 1 institutions of the city. That these ap
peals are numerous is not a matter for complaint, but for
just pride and congratulations. They stand as convinc
ing evidence of the broad and generous humanity of the
community. Some are directly sustained by the munici
pality, some by churches, some by fraternal or benevo
lent associations, and some by the voluntary contributions
of men and women of all classes, organizations and
creeds. By whatever means they are ostensibly sup
ported, however, their deep' foundation is the charitable
spirit of the people as a whole. By the zeal of the sup
porters of one off the institutions those of another are
encouraged and Thus all work together, though in diverse
ways, for the care and comforting of all the unfortunate"
among us.
Without a single exception the newspapers of the city
have opened their columns freely to these appeals. The
Call has gladly borne its share in this work and to-day
renews its urging that each and all of the fortunate ones
of the city should in proportion to his means give lib
erally, promptly and cordially to the maintenance of such
of these ins,tituttions as most appeal to his sympathies
or to his judgment of what is most needed at this time
in the way of charitable work among us.
No one who has prospered in life has any right to look
upon these Christmas appeals for liberal giving as an im
position or an importunity. As a matter of fact those,
who make the appeals have given of their time, their
energies and their money through the year far more than
they ask of others. Most of the appeals come in the
name of women, whose labors in behalf of the suffering
poor and unfortunate are sufficiently great to. justly en
title them to the highest reverence for their self-sacri
ficing devotion to the cause of humanity. Every one
should deem it an honor to be associated with them in
their work if it be only for a day.
Let it be borne 'in mind then by all who read these
Christmas appeals in the name of Chanty that the cause
is a noble one and the workers are worthy. Our city is
prosperous, opulent and in many ways prodigal. We
have made for ourselves a name for liberality and gen
erosity that is renowned throughout the world. Let us
now live up to it in our dealings with our own needy
ones. It is the season of love and of charity; it is the
time when the common brotherhood of humanity is
more keenly felt than at any other period of the year,
and no man should allow it to pass without doing some
thing to provn his sympathy with all that is being done
among us to minister to the distressed and to the or
phans, so that even the weakest and the poorest may have
some-share in that abundance of the good things of life
which has been vouchsafed to our city, our State and our
country.

E. H. Harriman, president of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, receives
merely a nominal salary. He fixes
the amount himself, it is asserted, so
that it will cover his actual expenses
in his semi-annual inspections of the
road. This was Collis P. Hunting
ton's policy. One year Mr. Hunting
ton gave up his salary entirely when
unfavorable ' business conditions Im
pelled him to retrench and cut down
the salaries of all other officers and
employes of the road. When James
J. Hill became interested in the Erie
Railroad he desired to have F. D. Un
derwood take the presidency. Mr.
Underwood was comfortably situated
as vice president of the Baltimore and
Ohio, and he had no wish to make
any change. He was tempted, as com
mon report has it, to go to the Erie
at a salary of $30,000. Melville E.
Ingalls desired to relinquish the presi
dency of the Cleveland, Cincinnati,
Chicago and St. Louis (Big Four)
Railroad a few years ago for the rea
son that he yearned for a prolonged
sojourn in Europe and a permanent
residence in New York- His success
as a business getter so impressed "Wil

they added to their personal solicita
tions a suggeselion that he name- his
own salary. Mr. Ingalls has declined
to say what . figure he marked, but

James J. Hill, president and prin
cipal owner of the Great Northern
Railway system, it is said, draws a
salary of $40,000. This figure also
heads the payroll of the Southern
Railway Company as the salary of
President Samuel Spencer. George F.
Baer. president of the great Reading'
system, which includes the Jersey
Central road, and W. B. Leeds, pres
ident of the Rock Island system, it is
understood, each receive a like
amount.
In most instances the salaries of
presidents of important railroads
range from $25,000 to $30,000. It is
a topic of Wall street gossip that the
New York. New Haven and Hartford,
in order to induce Charles S. Mellen,
the executive head of the Northern
Pacific, to accept the presidency of
the New England system, offered him
an increase of $7500 above his salary
as president of the Northern Pacific.
This would make his present salary
$32,500. Marvin Hughitt, president
of the Chicago and Northwestern,
draws a salary of $40,000, and Hor
ace G. Burt, president of the Union
Pacific, is supposed to get the same
amount.
George J. Gould is probably the poor
est paid railroad president in the busi
ness. His salary as president of the
Manhattan Railway Company is $5 per
year. The elevated railroad system in
New York is now controlled and oper
ated under a long lease by the com
pany which is building the subway
traction road, and the Manhattancom
pany simply exists to preserve its cor
porate rights. Mr. Gould's salary as
president of the Missouri Pacific sys
tem is whatever he chooses to make it.
The prevailing belief is that it is now
J25.000.
President A. J. Cassatt of the Penn
sylvania Railroad is now the best paid
railroad president in America. His sal
ary is $CO,000 per annum, and his asso

agree that business has been slow for

money, and therefore they are raising
the prices.
"Business has not been affected by
the weather, but shares the depression
which is ascribed mostly to the Stock
Exchange and-tho prolonged effects of
the war in South Africa. The head of
a Regent street department store said:
'The Stock Exchange is the best barom
eter we have. When money is tight the
people spend less in luxuries. There is
a scarcity of money, and the people
are economizing all they can.*

England ; and Holland, who'have been quick to present
enormous claims against Panama, seem to see in the
new repubJic another. fat and easy bird to^ pluck. They
will probably reform their first opinion when they
realize that Panama is of the brood of the American
eagle and is not yet able to take care of itself. Uncle
Sam certainly is not in the "business of making republics
for the profit of his trans-Atlantic friends.
THE statistics of organized labor disclosed at the
meeting of the American Federation are of very
great interest. During the year $75,000 was spept in
organization by 68 organizers, who organized 1747 new
unions, adding 442,100 new members, and bringing the
total strength of the Federation up to 1,745,270 individ
uals. The receipts from all sources were $247,802 96,
and the expenditures were $196,015 57, leaving $6o,
7&7 39 cash on hand. The strikes during the year were
1620, costing the unions $2,768,311 98. These statistics
make an imposing exhibit of the power, and resources of
organization.
The socialists proved to be very .strong in the Feder
ation, and when the issue was' made a very significant in
crease in that element was divulged. President Gompers
stated that next year would be a banner year for organ
ization on account of the Presidential campaign. A fear
was felt that the socialists were availing themselves of
the opportunity to control labor organizations, by join
ing and massing their vote. The convention voted to give
the executive committee unlimited authority and money
to use in fighting injunctions and defeating all legal pro
ceedings against unions.' The law department of" the
Federation was strengthened for this purpose, and a
programme was marked out which implies much work
for the courts and much employment for, lawyers.
Of course the general sentiment was for the closed
shop and the control of all labor by the organization,
with such limitation of apprenticeship as to give the
Federation a very firm control of the whole labor situa
tion. It is apparent that non-union labor has a strenuous
future before iti, in the face of this widespread and pow
erful Federation, determined that men shall work only
under its license and conditions. ' Much less attention
than was expected was given to the principles laid down
by the arbitrators of the hard coal strike, and the Federa
tion evidently feels strong enough to proceed indepen
dently of those principles.
This is the most formidable organization of labor ever
known, though its membership is still a minority of the
total labor of the country. During the past year great
progress was made in unionizing farm labor, especially in
the upper Mississippi valley, where the same principles
and methods are applied as have become familiar in
manufacturing and mercantile lines. Farmers were genr
erally found easy to control, when they discovered that
if their crop were characterized as unfair it was likely
to rot on their hands because of the impossibility of
breaking through the several and powerful obstructions
placed between it and the market. The power of organi
zation was found to increase with the perishability of
the crop and the growers of fruit and root crops and
truck vegetables were more easily subjected than the
grain and livestock menj
The sentiment of the convention was against any re
duction of wages to meet a possible tightening of the
times. This followed Mr. Gompers' counsel that wages
should remain the same, and it implies trouble in the im
mediate future, since the high price of raw cotton and
the falling off in demand in the metal trade are already
causing a reduction in wages. It is a grave question*
whether labor will not be more benefited by keeping the
same number of men at work, thougli at a reduced wage,
than by compelling the employers to meet the commer
cial situation by giving employment to a far less number
at the existing high wage. There is no power that can
compel a man to continue in business or run it-at a loss
in order to give employment to labor. Is it not better
to tide over tight times by keeping all labor employed
and earning, even at reduced wage, than to disemploy a
large part of it in order to pay high wages to the rest?
The ingenuity of man has devised no better system to
keep the capital of the country moving than by paying
wages to labor. The wage roll of the United States re
quires to pay it the use of the entire stock of money in
the country many times over every year. When em
ployment ceases the volume of money is the same, but it
is not circulated by the payment of wages, and the result
is the stagnation of business and harder times. A panic
may be averted by keeping all labor employed at a living
wage, but it is made surer and harder by the cessation of
wages.
In the best. days of English labor unions very philo
sophical attention was given to the household economies
of the laboring people. By co-operation in the purchase
of domestic supplies of the necessaries of life the pur
chasing power of wages was enlarged to equal the differ
ence between wholesale and retail prices, and it became
the custom to buy wholesale. The power of labor or
ganization in this country may be used some time to
direct attention to such economies, which will leave labor
in a , less dependent condition in the presence of hard
times.

"Take a good look at this woman and
see if you know her." These were the
words of one of the grave caretakers
in Laurel Hill Cemetery a few days ago
as a woman was approaching with a
bunch of flowers in her hand.
"There's quite a mystery about that
woman," he continued. "Just seven
years ago John Blank was buried up
there," pointing in the direction in
which the woman was going, "and from
that time to this two women who claim
to be his widows come regularly every
month and each one plants a bouquet
on hia grave. In each case on their ar
rival the one will pick up the bouquet
that the other one leaves on the grave
and throw it as far away as she can,
planting her own in its stead. At first
for about a year they used to come
regularly every week, but of late years
they come only monthly. One comes on
the 1st and the other on the 15th of
each month, with a clock-like regular

on the grave are'' thrown away and a

"Who was the man?"
"He was John Blank, a well-to-do

giving each woman to understand that
6he was his wife. "When he died both
women went into deep mourning over
him and have kept it up ever since.

content themselves by throwing one

IX EMPLOYES' SALARIES
The San Francisco Savings Union has
taken a hand in the row between the
directors and stockholders of the Co
lumbia Brewing Company. Yesterday
it filed two suits, one against August
F. Meyer, owner of 3000 shares of stock
in the concern, and the other against
Martin Ulrich, the secretary. The suit
against Meyer is for $15,000 damages
for an alleged breach of faith, and
the suit against Ulrich is for an In
junction restraining him from issuing
a certificate for 1500 shares of stock un
til such time as the question of the
ownership of the stock held by Meyer
is determined.
It appears from the complaint that
in January of last year Meyer and H.
D. Ulrich, president of the brewing
company, deposited .with the banking
company an envelope containing 3000
shares of stock In the concern. It was
agreed at the time, the plaintiff al
leges, that the envelope was not to be
opened by any one unless both Ulrich
and Meyer were present, and was not
to J be given to either one of the de
positors without the consent or â¢pres
ence of the other. Notwithstanding
this agreement, the plaintiff alleges
Meyer on December 16 came into the
bank and obtained possession of the
envelope and took it away with him.
It was returned the next day minus a
certificate for. 1500 shares of stock, and
the bank officials allege that it was ab
stracted by Meyer. The stock is val
ued at. $15,000, and that amount is
named by the bank in its prayer for
judgment. â¢Â»

., Clarke alleges that on December 7,
while he was intoxicated, he visited a
notorious house at 318 Sutter street,
where he met Rosalind Bower, famil
iarly known as the "Sweet Pea Girl,"
in whose company he remained for sev
eral days. During that time he claims
that she and certain confederates,
whose names he does not know, caused
him.to drink large quantities of liquors
which finally deprived him of his power
of reasoning,- and that while- in this
state the defendant took him into her
custody, induced him to go across the
bay, where she secured a license and
procured Rev. Mr. Van de Mark to go
through the form of a marriage cere
,mony. . .
it"was intimated to Mrs. Clarke early
yesterday that the \ suit would be
brought during the day, and . she was
in' conference with her attorney, O. K.
Cushing, for several hours preparing a
defense to the suit. It was announced
later in the, day that the wife has en~
gaged additional counsel to assist At
torney Cushing in her case, and that
she has been assured by the latter that
she has no reason to fear the outcome.
In discussing her defense yesterday
afternoon Mrs. Clarke said that her at
torney had nearly a dozen witnesses
who would testify to the condition of
Clarke just prior to and Immediately
after the Oakland marriage and would
also be able to prove beyond any ques
tion of doubt that he was fully cogni
zant of the step he was taking.
"An offer has been made by my hus
band's attorney to effect a compro
mise," said Mrs. Clarke, "but I -in
sisted that my only compromise would
be that he return to me. Now thattie
has brought his suit I will fight it .to
the end. I do not purpose to give him
a divorce, for I am satisfied that If he
was taken beyontl the' Influences of his
relatives he- would not have gone to
court, but would eventually have
sought a reconciliation. Day and night
I am being d6gged by detectives.
"Even this morning these men were
in the hotel trying to gain information
regarding my conduct at the Lick, and
otherwise trying to annoy me. I havn
some good friends, however, who have
offered to stand by me. Even the
trades people from whom my husband
ordered dresses and jewelry, which he
afterward instructed them not to give
me, have assured me of their sympa

the hearing of this suit."
It was stated yesterday that Mrs.

day a suit for the annulment of his
marriage was filed with the County
Clerk, the pummons in the case having
been served on Mrs. Rosalind Bower-

of -several days, resultant of heavy

City ' Attorney Lane advised the
Board of Supervisors yesterday that
he is unable to find a theory upon
which the board would be warranted
to refuse to assess for taxation a strip
of land twenty feet wide near the
junction of the southern boundary of
the Presidio and Locust street. An
attempt at dedication as a public
street was made by deed from the
owner, Mrs. Bowers, who requested
that it be exempted from taxation.
Lane says the street was never legal
ly dedicated according to charter re
quirements and he advises that the
property be taxed as private property.

Death of a Young Mother.
Mrs. Edna Brenzel, a married
woman, 19 years of age, residing with
her husband at 2722 Diamond street,
died at 6 o'clock yesterday morning
after having given birth to a son on
the preceding afternoon. Dr. E. W.
Thomas, the attending physician,
called the attention of Coroner Le
land to the case, as he was at a loss
to account for the woman's death In
any other way than by the theory of
heart disease. An autopsy by Morgue
Surgeon Bacigalupi disclosed the fact
that death had been caused by a blood
clot in the heart. The baby is alive.

Little Alice Ruth Maguire. the 10
year-old daughter of the late Andrew
Maguire and granddaughter of the late
pioneer, Owen Maguire, has won her
battle for a portion of her grand
fathers wealth. In a dismissal filed
yesterday of the suit brought by her
mother, Marlon A. Maguire, against
Dr. Charles S. Maguire. her brother
in-law, who, by a deed executed less
than two months prior to old Ma
guire's death, acquired all of his $ 75,
000 estate, the announcement was
made that a compromise had been ef
fected and that the little girl would
receive her just dues. Just as soon as
arrangements can be completed Dr.
Maguire will, according to reliable au
thority, turn over to his little niece
several first-class mortgages, worth in
all $15,000. He will also, during the
minority of the little girl, or for a
period -of right years, pay her the sum
of 550 a month. It is on these condi
tions that Mrs. Maguire waives all the"
claims against her brother-in-law and
also waives ri&ht to take an appeal of
any sort.
The legal battle over the wealth of
eyed Owen Mcguire was commenced
er-.vrr'-.l n-.oi-ths ago by the n"l'n<j by
J^'::rioii A. Hu^ViTC, widow of Andrew
t!:i*yuife and mother of 7 the baby
Clah&ant* cf a suit to set aside the <vm
c*yance ly which her father-in-iaw
gave to Dr. Maguire, the defendant in
Ike suit. alJ his- realty and mon.?y in
bank. The property involved is worth â¢,
about 575.000 and the action was j
based on the ground that the physi- t
cian. by reason of the fact that his I
father had been a resident of his home !
for many years prior to his death, had
obiained an influence over him and
exerted it to the detriment of the other j
members of the Maguire family, par- j
ticnlurly his little niece. Mrs. Ma- j
guire therefore asked the court to de- i
dare that her little daughter was en- j
titled to that half of her grandfather's j
property her father would have re- !
ceived if he were alive, the old man |
having died intestate. i
The complaint recited that Owen
Maguire after the death of his wife,
Ann, had gone to live with his son, the j
physician. His wife's death preyed I
upon his mind to such an extent that
he became mentally weak and depend
ent While in that condition, averred
the plaintiff. Dr. Maguire kept from
him all knowledge of her and her }
daughter and allowed the old man to I
see only these whom he knew would j
not interfere with his alleged plan to j
acquire the old man's wealth. She al
leged that in accordance with this plan
he had prepared a conveyance which
gave to him all his father's realty, his |
deposits in the banks and other per- |
sonal property, and on May 26 of last
year prevailed upon his father, at that
time 75 years of age, to sign it. Two j
months later the old man died and it |
was only when the conveyance was re- j
Since the former trial Mrs. Dunning's
father has joined the silent majority.
He and Lees were Important witnesses,
but the District Attorney thinks he will
be able to connect the various links in
the chain of evidence against the de
fendant broken by the deaths of Lees
and Pertnington by other witnesses.
The crime of which she was charged
was a most atrocious one. She had be
come infatuated with John P. Dunning,
a newspaper man, and it ia alleged that
on August 4, 1898, she posted a box of
poisoned candy to Dunning*s wife, Mrs.
Mary Elizabeth Dunning, who was at
that time stopping with her father.
John B. Fennington, at Dover, Del.
Mrs. Dunning received the box of can
dy on August 9, and she and her sister,
Mrs. Ida H. Deane. ate heartily of it.
Mrs. Deane died on August 11 and Mrs.
Dunning the following day after suf
fering great pain. Two children par
took of the candy, but they recovered.
The late Chief of Police Lees handled
the case and soon had Mrs. Botkin un
der arrest. *
The former trial of Mrs. Botkin was
one of the most sensational in the an
nals of the criminal courts In this
State. She was convicted by a jury in
Judge Cook's court of murder in the
first degree on December 30, 1898, with
the penalty of imprisonment for life.
Subsequently she was granted a new
trial by the Supreme Court on the
ground of the Judge's misdirection
the jury, and has been in the County
Jail since.
The case of Mrs. Cordelia Botkln,
charged with murder, will be placed on
the calendar in Judge Cook's court this
morning and a date will be fixed for
her second trial. The Judge made this
order yesterday after consultation with
District Attorney Byington, the object
being to have the trial at as early a
day after New Year as possible. Ar
rangements have been made to bring
the witnesses from Delaware, and they
have all consented to be present at the
trial.

Th- valuable prizes In the open golf
tournaments of Great Britain have be
come almost a monopoly for four great
golfers, who are possessors of the high
est skill in the game. Besides these
four there are several golfers, who, on
their day. are equal to the best, but
who have not the marvelous steadiness
of the top four. In order to give these
others some chance of the big prizes, it
has several times been suggested that
some system of handicapping should
be applied to professional tournaments.
It is, of course, not possible to handicap
the professional players as If they were
aU members of the same club, when
they come from all parts of the United
Kingdom. Yet it !s t-ertainly desirable
to render the competitions for the Im
portant money prizes more open than it
has been for scrme years. The Profes-
Fional Golfers' Association has decided
that under no circumstances are handi
cap allowances to be made to members
of the association, but that on suitable
occasion some members may owe one
or tr.ore strokes, the other competitors
starting from scratch.
It has been found that the numerous
p-olf clubs scattered â¢ throughout the
United Kingdom * supply- a want in
pmall tc-wns and country, districts. , In
puch places the leisured men of middle
age, such i Â«? retired officers cf the army
or navy.' or business men who have
made their pile, found time hang some
what heavily on^ their "hands." "There
was no place where they could meet
men of their own kJnd to .'discuss na
tional and local affairs, and get health
ful exercise and recreation. Nowadays
these men play a round of -golf oh every
fine morninff and probably repeat the
Two .'..tennis tournaments will be
played on Christmas day and both will
be handicap doubles events. In each
event the prizes will be the three-time
cups. . The California Club trophies
have been competed for but twice. The,
first winners were Will Allen and Dr.
Hill. The present holders' are Chester
and Grant Smith. The dlolden Gate
Clubcups are In the possession of the
Baker brothersâ George and Nell â who
won the last tournament easily.
Â¦ In the California Club tourney there
will be several changes in the teams.
As Grant Smith will be. unable to play,
his brother will join forces with Will
Collier. The latter first entered with
Frank â¢ Mitchell, but they did not play
well : together! Mitchell in future will
play with J. D. MacGavin. â¢
It is expected that Joe Tobln and Will
Taylor. willenter the tournament. The
presence of these, two players would
increase the interest greatly.
"In recent practice games they have
shown * remarkable strength .as a
doubles team. In a handicap event
they w-ould be hard to beat, as they
play a careful, steady game. They
would probably play scratch with
Mitchell and MacGavin. Collier and
Smith should play even with teams like
Allen and Hill and Salisbury t and
Stringham. .*'
Despite the fact that the cups at the
park have been competed for almost
two years no team at present playing
has two victories to its credit.
- The Hotchklss brothersâ -Marius and
Homer-^won the trophle3 twice, but no
longer play together. The following
teams ' : ve won once: ', Church arid Mc-
Kay, Hotchklss brothers, . Smith and
The San Francisco" Scottish Bowling
Club will start its fourth tournament
this afternoon on the Golden Gate Park
green. The tournament completed two
weeks ago developed several cracks
who were previously unheard of. All of
these players are entered in the new
tourney and men like Messrs. Lawson
and Moffatt will have no easy time
winning.
Mr. Moffatt Is the present champion.
He showed great skill In the third
tournament,' which he won cleverly.
Mr. Lawson won the second event, but
did not play, in. the third. Besides
these two cracks tl.e most likely can
didates for championship honors are
McNaught. McLaren, Joseph and
Jame3 Gray and McLachlan. As there
are ninety-two entries it will take sev
eral months to complete the tourna
ment. .
On Christmas day the bowlers will
meet the cracks of the Oakland Club
for the third time. The 'San Francis
cans have two victories to their credit,
but the* bowlers from across the bay
are improving all the time and will stay
with it until they down their opponents.
They made .an excellent showing, last
month on the park rinks, and expect
to do even better next. week.. .It; will be
a four-rink match and will be. played on
the: Oakland green unless it, is in poor
condition. In this case the match will
be played at the park.
The entrjftllst for the doubles tourna
ment will close during the first week
of next month. Many. names are being
posted at the clubhouse and the bowl
ers loc-k forward to an interesting
event. Th> doubles and singles tourna
ments . will . be ; run simil taneousl y and

Fourth Tournagnent of the
Scots to Be Commenced To-
Day in GoldeSi Gate Park
While one or two track or so-called
coast records have gone a-glimmering,
nothing bordering on the sensational
has been accomplished by any of the
crack Eastern performers.
But the meeting is yet in its infancy,

or two records at least ought to be
shaved down before May day arrives.
Â¦ It was unfortunate that the riding
material had to be lessened by the .rul
ing off of three such promising riders
as D. Hall, M. Adkinsand young Fer
rell. In Europe a jockey must be care
ful about his personal habits, else he
quickly finds himself in disfavor, not
only with the official* but employers
as well. Too many midnight carousals
usually accomplish the downfall of
American riders. Those after-dark
banquets are all expensive, and if win
ning mounts will not settle the bill
there is always the generous hearted
bookmaker, in every cfime willing to
lend. the financially distressed jockey a
helping hand. One good turn deserves
another, and sooner or later the jockey
finds, himself In trouble.
The Chicago press seem to think the
California Jockey Club hit the nail on
th# head when Hall/ Adkins and Fer
Â¦rell w'ero ruled off. The Sunday Rec
ord-Herald of December 13 says Adkins
narrowly escaped : the judicial ax last
summer. His employers.' the article in
sinuates, took' time by the forelock and
gave Adkins an enforced vacation.
Hall, the same article states, was ruled
off : the Charleston outlaw track â¢ for
using a battery. Possibly this should
.not be held against the Texas rider. If
he had decided to turn over a new leaf.
Many riders who achieved great prom
inence on the turf made mistakes while
serving their -apprenticeship 'which
mightnot look well if played up .in
print. -
A TRIO OF HIGH CLASS HORSES WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO PLAT A PROMINENT PART DURING THE
PRESENT. REASON OF WINTER RACING ON THIS COAST IN THE RICH EVENTS FOR WH^CH THEY
MAY BE ELIGIBLE. â¢
Allen, Pouth and Dunlap, Whitney and
Brady and the Baker brothers.
The Baker brothers are the strongest
combination at present at the park. In
the last tournament they played from
scratch with Routh and Dunlap and
won the event without losing a seL
They were undoubtedly underestimated
by the handicapper and In the coming
event will be placed below scratch. The
Bakers are the only team playing to
gether that has won the cups. Griffin
and Dunlap will probably join forces
and should make a much stronger com
bination than Routh and .Dunlap.
George Janes and H. Russell. will play
on the same side of the net in future
and will make an aggressive team.
Heretofore the two clubs have man
aged to run their tournaments without
interfering with each other, but com
plications -are commencing" to arise.
Each club started a tournament on
Thanksgiving day and neither event
has been completed up to date. Allen
and MacGavln are r. ambers of both
organizations, but joined.the California
Club first . nd are looked upon as Cali
fornia Club players. They happened to
come together In the finals of both
events and hence the difficulties. The
entry lists are becoming, so large that it
takes several days to run off a tourna
ment.' It will probably become neces
sary In future for. the players who are
members of both clubs to choose be
tween them. Few of the park players
have Become members of the California
Club, while quite a number of good
players from the latter clnb have joined
the Golden Gate Club. . In future when
their is a conflict raun like MacGavin
and Allen will play In the California
Club tournaments. It would be an ex
cellent plan for the two clubs to send
delegates to a meeting to be. called for
the purpose of surmounting these diffi
culties. The clubs are on the -best of
terms and are anxious not to interfere
with each other.,

Announcement was made yesterday
that Union Coursing Park will open
under entirely new management with
a meeting: on January 1, 2 and 3. The
men back of the new venture are men
of influence and standing and they
promise to .put coursing on a high
plane.
The sport will be promoted under" the
auspices of the Interstate Coursing
Club. All its annual events will be
run as in the past. The first of these
will be the California plate and Belle
Brandon cup, which will be decided on
February 20, 21 and 22. The announce
ment sent out is to the effect that the
park will continue to run as long as
the owners of greyhounds show an in
clination to support It by making lib
eral entries.
Coursing will commence at Ingleside
Park to-day at 11:30. when the first
brace cf dogs in the open stake will
be sent to the slips. A number ,of East
ern greyhounds, including the speedy
Northern Express, will be in the run
ning. The likely winners look to ba:
Among the Empire Club men who
were out were: J. P. Sweeney, J. B.
Hauer, F. S. Judah, P. Peltier, Con
Ramon, L. H. Allen, Dr. Clyde Payne,
F.. Blair Turpin, F. B. Surryhne, Dr.
B. F. Alden, Bert Patrick and Dr. A. C.
Sylvester. The guests of the members
were J. M. Kilgarif, Captain Cantwell
of the revenue service and J. P. Jacob
son. Â¦Â¦''-., e'
L. H. Allen was high gun with thir
ty-two birds. Although all the mem
bers had good shooting. Teal and
widgeon were the birds most in evi
dence. The club is baiting heavily and
Ihe members expect some good can
vasback shooting from now on.
The shooting was good on all the
marshes last Sunday. Hundreds of
men returned from Alvarado and Al
viso and all had birds. The San Mateo
marsh also yielded good returns.
The storm of yesterday has damp
ened the ardor of the sportsmen, who
expect the birds to be scattered over
a^wide area to-morrow.. The overflow
bet\veeh*Davis and Sacramento has at
tracted thousands of eprig, widgeon
and teal from the - Suisun marshes.
The market hunters and.aXew sports
men are endeavoring to thin out the
flocks, but '"make little Impression .on
them/'-'':*
Harry Corbett and Dick Dwyer, the
starter, had an excellent shoot on
Wednesday at Middle River, near An
tioeh. ..The. Joint ".bag for. one morn
ing's shoot was eighty birds. These
Included fifty-eight mallard, nine snipe
and six widgeon. The sportsmen were
the guests of J. B. Tisdale and l Al
Maltas and were most" hospitably en
tertained on their ark. The mallards
were there in gTeat numbers' and all
were plump birds.
The royal canvasbacks made â¢ their
appearance on all the preserves last
Sunday, apparently having been driven
down from Klamath and other north
ern lakes by the cold weather.
The birds were all plump and in
fine condition, showing they had
traveled but a comparatively short dis
tance. As they fly at the rate or more
than ninety miles an hour, a few hpurs
would bring them from the northern
border of the Stale. China Slough, on
the preserve of the Alameda Gun Club
on the Sonoma marsh, lived up to its
reputation as a desirable place for can
vasback shooting. Nineteen members
of the club were out and secured more
than 800 "cans," the majority of the
members getting limit bags. Among
those out were Messrs. Norton, Paul
Kingston, Louis Bolander, Gelssler,
Swales, Baird and others.
There were a few "cans'/ killed on
the Alameda marsh and Con Ramon
was so fortunate as to bring down
some on the Monterey preserve of the
Empire Gun Club. Many "cans" were
seen and they displayed no fear of the
sportsmen nor of. their decoys, which
indicates they strangers in these
parts. â¢
Christmas day will, as usual, be a
busy one for the players on the links
of the San Francisco Golf Club. There
will be a handicap tournament over
eighteen holes, the two players who
make the lowest net scores receiving
prizes. The gross scores will serve as
the qualifying round for a match play
contest, in which the handicaps given
at the beginning will apply throughout
the competition.
The eieht players who hand In the
lowest gross scores will qualify for this
contest, four days being allowed in
which to c :plete each round of match
play. -*_s far as is known at present
there will be no competition on the
links of the San Rafael Golf Club on
Christmas day.
The invitation handicap held by the
Ean Rafael Golf Club last Saturday
proved quite successful, notwithstand
ing the unfavorable weather, attracting
a fair number of competitors and being
productive of a close contest. The play
was over eighteen holes, a silver cup
being offered for the best net score and
a prize for the lowest gross score. E. J.
Hooper, though he has had little prac
tice for the past two months, played a
strong game, winning the cup for the
best handicap score and tying with
Captain T. B. S. Menzies for the trophy
for lowest gross score. The full scores
are shown in the table:

THÂ«: SAN FRANCISCO .CALL. SATURDAY. DECEMBER . 19, 1903.
10Jim Wilson was no match for Pier
pont Ordway and, after the former
landed a few good punches in the first
round, the bout was stopped. Billy
Jensen put Jack Adams to the mat for
the count after a few seconds of going.
Billy Healy finished George Sullivan in
the second round, and Charles Weber
knocked Ed Smith out in one round.
Sullivan used both hands and landed
some stiff punches. He closed one of
King's lamps and had the latter all but
gone when the gong sounded. King
went to his corner, called for something
out of a bottle and prepared to go some
more. But the chair felt good and Sul
livan looked like a bad man, so the
portly man decided to betake himself
to his dressing-room, while the crowd
hissed and said unpleasant things.
The other bouts on the card were all
fast ones, and none of them went over
four rounds. Harry Tenny took all the
fight out of Harry McCloud in two
rounds. George Herbert, who looked
like a ringer, hit Jack Burke one hard
wallop in the jaw during the initial
round of their engagement and Burke
was out for ten minutes.
t Alex Greggains had another little
burlesque on the boards last night at
his Sixth-street gymnasium. The real
thing of the night was another bout
between Olin Sullivan and John King,
th* heavy-weights. It might have
turned out to be a good scrap had Klrigi
come up for a little more action in
stead of keeping his seat and taking off
his mitts when the gong sounded for
the second round.
King is famous in sailors' boarding
house circles as a bouncer who has
them all blanked, but the referee
fused to allow the rough tactics last
night, and so King ran second. He
opened up the go by grabbing Sullivan
and treating him catch as catch can
style. When they got up again Sulli
van walloped King some and ere he
finished the water-front terror was all
in.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Deo. IS.
The fighting game la in serious dan
ger In Oakland. Mayor Oln^y has de
clared his unalterable opposition to the'
monthly professional boxing contests
now being held in this city, and strong
ly expressed himself to-day at. the
meeting of thÂ« Board of Police arid
Fire Commissioners.
That body under authority of an or
dinance is given power to grant or to
deny applications from clubs for per-'
mits to give these contests. Mayor Ol
ney declared Le approved the ordinance
because he believed it gave discretion
to the Board of Police and Fire Com-
missioners to act in the. matter of ap
plications. But In operation the Mayor
says he "has found that it Is* a ca'se of
grant one and grant i all requests for
permits.
It has been strongly rumored In club
circles- that an attempt .would be made
after the first of January^ to repeal the
boxing ordinance. Evidence of the in
secure position that some of the club
men felt themselves in was manifested
at to-day's meeting . of the Police
Board, when the. Reliance Club filed a
petition /or a permit to give two boxing
exhibitidns in January, one on the 5th
and the other on the 19th. Heretofore
each club has confined Itself to one con
test night a month.
It was this petition that provoked
the remarks of the Mayor, who said:
"I am opposed to these so-called pro
fessional boxing contests. I never saw
one and I never shall voluntarily wit
ness one. It was my belief that this
ordinance gave the board discretion in
granting permits. But It looks as If
one must either grant all applications
or deny all.'"
Repeal of the ordinance, which rests
with the City Council, would bar the
sport in this city, leaving conditions as
they existed last March, when District
Attorney Allen decided that the clubs'
contests were illegal.
President McElroy of the board ex- |
plained that the ordinance was passed
in conformity with an act of the last
Legislature which gave municipalities
the right to allow boxing contests to be
held under police regulation. .,
The Mayor was excused from voting
when Commissioner Turner moved to
grant the Reliance Club's application,
the motion being carried by the votes
of Commissioners Turner and McElroy.

HJs work with Foley is chiefly
wrestling and bustling him about the
gymnasium. He boxed three hard
rounds with Joe Thomas yesterday, al
ternating them with the same number
with Foley. He also did a lot of bag
punching. His -. breathing apparatus
seemed in splendid order. In this re
spect he is better at present than his
opponent. Corbett puffs and blows
while working, fast,Â»but this will grad
ually disappear as his condition im
proves.
Hanlon 'is already nearly at weight
and expects to scale 127 or 123 pounds
the night of the fight. He says he could
fight at 128 pounds if necessary.
Â¦ Corbett's admirers cla'm he is the
best repeater in the boxing game. Hl3
second fight with any man has always
been better than the first. He learns
a'.raan's style quickly, and plans his
campaign of offense or defense rapidly.
Hanlon denies having discussed the
matter of referee with any one. He
has been quoted as sayfng he would
not accept Eddie Graney because the
latter did not give him the decision
over Corbett. The consensus of opinion
at the time of the fight w.is that It
would have been* unjust to Corbett to
take the championship from him on a
hair-line decision and that Graney did
the right thing in calling it a draw.
The baseball nines captained by Ed
die Hanlon and Toung Corbett will
cross bats this afternoon at Recreation
Park at 2: SO, provided the weather is
clear. Much rivalry exists between the
two teams and a great game fs ex
pected. The proceeds will be devoted to
the mother of Frank McC^nnell. the
young boxer who was Injured some
time ago in his battle with Spider
Welch. Harry Corbett will referee.
â¢ Eddie Hanlon believes in variety in
sparring partners, and all persons of
about his Inches are welcomed at the
Alameda training quarters.
The little boxer does not spar with
Harry "Foley, having found that it im
pairs his judgment of instance. A blow
that would catch Foley on the Jaw
would miss Young Corbett by many
inches. Hanlon wants to accustom him
self to landing accurately on his box
ing partners as though he was going to
fight one of them. '

Sir Thomas Lipton in replying said
he was a proud man to be the recipient
of such a splendid gift, adding:
"It, will be cherished by me as my
most valued trophy."
Referring in a humorous vein to the
value of the gift in "raising the wind,"
Sir Thomas said that he never really
had any difficulty, in so doing except
at Sandy Hook. He had hoped, he said,
to add an interest to the fiscal con
troversy by increasing the British sil
ver Imports with that interesting Im
port, the' America's cup. Having
failed to do so, he found in this silver
service a splendid substitute.
Speaking with much feeling. Sir
Thomas said that If J any action of his
had - tended to the development of a
better feeling between Great' Britain
and the United States, It would be a
source of sincere happiness to him to
the end of -his days, though what he
had done, was merely -a slight return
for the generosity and courtesy ' show
ered upon him by the American people."

FRESNO, Dec. 18.â W. S. James, an
ex-convict, was arrested last evening
as he was entering a saloon on Mari
posa street by Deputies Walter J.
Pickett and Walter S. McSwain.
James with two other men, said to be
convicts, are accused of holding up a
train on the O. R."& N. road, at Cor
bett. Or., on September 24 last.
Miner, an alleged confederate, is be
lieved to be in hiding in this city and
his capture is considered certain. The
police and Sheriff's office are making
every effort to run him to earUi.
James was a member of the notorious
Dilwood-Jame3 gang, whose crimes and
depredations several years ago were
almost without parallel. He was sus
pected of the murder of a merchant
named Good, which occurred at Tar
pey, near Fresno. He has been arrest
ed several times and twice served
terms of imprisonment in San Quen
tin. It was while he was serving his
second term that the plans for the
train robbery were made.
For some weeks James has been em
ployed on the Kearney estate as a
night watchman.
Officials in San Francisco and Oregon
have been notified of the capture.

Men who represent the university in

it was deemed impracticable to give

distribution. The universities have

Kunz, who rode Young Pepper in the
first race, was given three days on the
ground by the judges for rough riding.
He bumped and nearly threw The Ha
waiian on the stretch turn.
Mrs. Chandler, as guardian of Jockey
Chandler, Is seeking an annulment of
the contract held on the boy's services
by Caesar Young. She alleges that J.
L. Haskell, who formerly held the con
tract and sold the same to Young, is
withholding money due the rider, and
the stewards have the matter under
advisement.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Poorlands, the secojid choice, an
nexed the steeplechase, which was a
farcical affair. Phil Archibald ran sec
und and Indian II, the favorite, third.
IJoyal S. it was generally supposed, ran
out at the second 1 obstacle.
ARCADE WIXS CLEVERLY. -'VV
Arcade, the big maidenj from the
Jennings stable, disposed of a fair con
signment in the fifth number, a, seven
furlong run decided under selling con
ditions. Hainault was favorite, 1 and
after getting away none too well
was thÂ«> recipient of an apathetic ride
from Hildebrand. Jack Martin, on Ar
cade, passed Jockey Club in the
stretch, winning easily by more than
three lengths at odds of 10 to 1. Hain
ault was lucky to get inside. the money.
In the last event, at one mile and
fifty yards. Hildebrand seemed to have
recovered his usual composure. He had
the leg up on Forest King and riding
an intelligent and energetic race beat
The Frc-tterÂ»and Achilles with the ut
most ease. .
Soufriere, a filly racing In the colors
of Dayton Co., aTid 15 to 1 in the
betting at one stage, took the opening
scramble. She was ridden by Ander
son, and outgaming Young Pepper at
the end wojn by less than a length.
Harbor was*" third. Birkenruth qn the
favorite Effervescence ran fourth.
Hildebrand rode a poor race on
Mountebank in the mile selling affair
or the gelding would have scored. As
it was Larsen, astride the lukewarm
favorite I O U, saved ground on the
rail, beating Mountebank nearly a
length. Merwan, with Booker up, fin
ished third.
Ahumada ran disappointingly, finish
ing fourth behind San Nicholas, a horse
with . no especial fondness for muddy
going. .
Speculation was brisk on all six of
the different events, and the attend
ance was fair despite the threatening
weather. Favorites were three times
returned winners.
Muresca, Royal Rogue and Glenden
ning declined the issue, which left a
field of six to start. Eleven to twenty
was the best price laid about Shot Gun.
He acted a bit fractious at the post, as
did Kenilworth and Eyea G. It was a
one-horse race, though, when the. bar
rier did go up. Jack Martin sent the
favorite out in front, and. while Kenil
worth. made quite a bid in" the stretch
failed. to make good, Shot Gun winning
by half a length, with something to
give away. . , Â¦ \"
AHUMADA A DISAPPOINTJIENT
j Every time Waiter Jennings fires Shot
Gun from the stable the strapping son
of Artillery makes a report- that sounds
like ready money. Shot: Gun did not
carry all of his baggage with him in_
the Futurity course handicap at Ingle
side yesterday, for he was requested to
shoulder, but ,119 pounds. . '
From the mannerln which he handled
it and blew home ahead of Kenilworth
the big one can pick up two or three
bookmakers' stands, an old boiler or
two from the pumping works,;' all the
lead water piping on the premises and
with a stout-hearted steeplechase rider
in the pilot-house can beat most of the
ordinary racing material while' the wet
weather /continues. " .. :

with what result.

.MOBILE, Ala., Dec. 18.â Advices re
ceived here ,by steamer indicate that
another revolution is imminent in Hon
duras and that it is expected to take
place soon after the first of the year.
It is expected to be fostered by ex-
President Sierra through a special en
voy, with the purpose of ousting Presi
dent Bonilla.
On his retirement from the executive
qhair of Honduras President Sierra
named Senor Arias for President and
he was given the position. Then Bo
nilla organized a revolution and over
threw Arias, who is now in jjrison at
Tegucigalpa.
It is said the people are dissatisfied
with the conduct of the Government,
and especially in the matter of the
Honduras Railway, which was ' built
by English capitalists. Since its con
struction not a cent of interest or prin
cipal has been paid the bondholders,
and it is asserted that the English Gov
ernment will take cognizance of the
matter and enforce the payment.
ROME, Dec. IS.â Considerable excite
ment prevailed in the mother* houses
Â«'f. the -Dominicans, Augustinlans,
Franciscans and the Recollects over
the announcement of the settlement of
the .friars' lands questions in the Phil
ippines. The friars were glad- the dis
cussions had been concluded, but think
the Order got little for the lands, since
the price they originally asked, $12,
000,000. was, they declare, under ; the
estimated value*of the lands, the value
of which had been much increased, es
pecially since the American occupation
and the re-establishment of order in
the Archipelago. The friars say the
money they .will Â¦ receive is scarcely
enough to pay what they borrowed
when they were deprived of everything
b.v the revolution. Besides, they point
out. only part of the money will go to
the friars, asthe lands, were really
transferred to a company formed in
Madrid by the Marquis.de Comilllas.

Navigation Company. The Dominicans
succeeded in so thoroughly concealing
their ownership of lands that the Vati
can itself threatened to punish them se
verely for. having tried to deceive even
the ecclesiastical authorities.

TOLEDO, Ohio, Dec. IS.â A storm of
gigantic proportions is brewing in the
ranks of the Independent Order of Odd
Fellows, one of the strongest fraterni
ties in the world. Grand Master Charles
C. Pavey has determined to force out
every saloon-keeper, bartender and
gambler in the order in Ohio, pursuant
to a mandate issued by the Sovereign
Grand Lodge of the United States, but
which has stood as a Gead letter.
Thousands of men in the liquor busi
ness are affiliated with the Odd Fel
lows, and, while Pavey realizes already
that he has undertaken a huge task,
he has issued a mandate that they
must either honestly and legitimately
renounce and give up their business
before January 10, 190$, or be expelled
from the order.
"Any noble grand," he says, "who
shirks or refuses to do his duty will
be suspended. They must convict and
expel from the order all such mem
bers. -
"Any lodge," he added, "that put3
on trial and convicts such member and
fails to suspend him will have its
charter arrested at once."

CHICAGO, Dec. 18. â There was unusual In
terest In the wheat pit to-day and a very strong
market. A number of factors entered Into the
situation of a nature to create anxiety in the
minds of shorts, and the buying from this
source was of a good . character. A marked
. reduction In the number of cars received at
Minneapolis and Duluth, steady cables and un
favorable weather conditions in Argentina
were early influences that tended to create a
bullish sentiment among traders, i The opening
on May was a shade to %@%c higher at 81 %c
to 81Â«i@Sl%e, and from the time the first sale
was made until the final tap of. the bell prices
showed constant tendency to- advance. A
cablegram from Argentina- to a local -firm
stated that there had been frosts In the southern
portion and damage to wheat was estimated
at 25 uer cent. A little later in the session a
rumor was circulated on the floor that Japan
had declared war uuon Russia, and, although
this report was denied, a big decline in con
sols and Japanese securities in London wai an
added . Incentive to the crowd and the buying
became general. Advices from the Southwest
to the effect that many complaints were coming
in of insufficient moisture and unfavorable
conditions in the Southwest was taken as' In
dication of a possible shortage next â¢ year.
Closing prices were close to the top, May being
%c higher at 82%@82%c. after selling at 82%c.
Corn had a firm undertone, but the volume
of trading was small. Late !n the day the
market was influenced by the ; heavy = export
tales. There was some selling, but the ma
jority of traders were inclined : to â¢ favor ' the
bull side. May closed %c up to 43%c. . ( '
Shorts were the best buyers of oats and the
â¢elling was largely by scalpers. * The strength
in wheat was the principal influence. May
opened a shade lower to a shade higher at
' Chicago Grain Market.
' The Poultry market was quite active, , as re
tailers were stocking, up In anticipation of light
receipts' and a. good demand next week, but,
as supplies were plentiful, prices were no
higher. The sixth car of Western for the cur
rent week was on pale, and there were liberal
receipts of domestic stock. Another car of
Western will be marketed to-day. Dressed
Turkeys were offering freely, and good stock
sold readily at 20CJ23c per lb, while poor
stock was practically unsalable at 18@19c. A
car of Western chilled Btock was. received and
feis placed in storage for the Christmas trade.
Several' more cars are expected between now
and Christmas, and prices I are expected to be
lower than they* were at Thanksgiving. Live
Turkeys ruled firm, under limited supplies, j
:,Game was in moderate receipt, and prices
were without quotable change. ?

about tho same. A cable from Now South
[Wales paid: "The Wheat crop of this the
second largest crop growing colony In 'Aus
tralfa. Is officially estimated at 2S.5(;s,000
buRhels. against 15,275.(*i0 bushels in 1902. and
j a five-year average of l."Â».2Nl,00O bushels.".
Chicago was 1 cent higher. Wires to Cutter
j & Moseley ascribed the advance to heavy local
I buying on talk of rain damage In the Argen
tine and uneasiness over prevalent war ru
mor3 in connection with Russia and Japan.
Sixty-one loads were taken for export and
Bradstreet'a gave the exports from American
portu during the week. Flour included, at 3,
.'JU3.000 bushels. Minneapolis reported a poor
Flour demand last week, with the result that
f> mills arc not running this week, and others
may shut down. .
There Is nothing new in thlg market but
the trade pay that any pressure to poll would

Â¦ Green Peas from Lps Angeles were quoted
lower, but all other descriptions from that sec
tion continued' to bring high prices. Peas ar
rived freely and the receipts included much
oft stock, hence the lower rates. Green Peppers
continued to drag, as the demand was limited,
nnd supplies were too heavy for the market to
absorb at the prevailing high prices. A few
scattering lots of bay Tomatoes were received
and sold slowly, the Los Angeles being pre
ferred. The other vegetables were In ample

of the offerings were of ordinary quality and
dragged at unsteady rates. River Hurhanks
were firmly held, but were quiet and will un
doubtedly continue so until after the turn of
the year. A carload of Sweet Potatoes was
marketed, and cleaned up quickly at a firmer
figure. Tfce Onion market was (inn, under

NEW YORK STOCK LIST.
NEW YORK. Dec. , 18.â The inertia of to
d&y's etock market was slightly overcome in
the last hour of the trading. In sympathy with
the 6trong upward movement in United States
Eteel preferred, following the formal announce
ment that the ftÂ»el billet pool had determined
upon a maintenance of urese.m prices. Much
of the Â¦:â¢Â¦â¢Â¦;;Â¦; of unstable conditions in the Bled
market and of disruDtlng tltenutes amonjr the
iT3dnl.M?rs of Â£hÂ£ jK"Â»ois c^tit^r^d in tiie toillet
trade and the definite settlement of the ques
tion had an immediate choiring effect on ail
connected with the iron ' and steel trades.
United States Steel preferred was taken in
enormous blocks at an advance of 2 1 * over
last nUrht. The effect upon the general mar
ket, howevr. was scarcely more than to over
come the heavy and dracging ton<Â» which had
held price* back all day. ThÂ«> recovery was
as much lacking in animation as had been
the decline. Pennsylvania showed the most
marked symnathy with the rise in United
Etate* Steel preferred and gained over a puint.
AÂ» this Ftock hax ixnn very heavily gold on the

the latter stock comt'Ietely overshadowed the
whole market In point of volume.
Amalgamated Copper continued active, but
â¢was clupglsh. and the London market for raw

â¢elling movement In Rock Island. That jrtocV

ol*co second preferred 3*i Â».nd the Rock

Rumors of a coming bond Iwue were the cause
of this weakness. The $iu.000,000 Atchii>on
bond Issue was the subject of ccntinued dis
cuBKion and the causo of heaviness in Atchl
â¢fla ami cf Mine other stocks In which bond
tacurs had been feared but denied.
The revival of appr*-hensrk>n over the Russo-
Jajianpse dlsrnite affected the market by re
flection from London. The lrresponMvenÂ»ps cf
the market to thÂ» consistrnt flrmnfTPi" of United

%iew of the overwhelming preponderance of
Its vohsmÂ« of business, amounting to a third

There was a good demand for well-colored
Naval Orange*, both for local use and ship
ping account, and about 10C0 boxes were sold
for shipment to Honolulu on the steamer Ala
meda, out to-day. , The market otherwise was
quiet and featureless, as the rain kept buyers
away. Tangerines were weaker, owing to the
competition of Japanese Mandarins, which
were offering freely at easy rates. Grape Fruit
was firmer, as supplies of choice, well-colored
stock were limited. Tropical fruits were plen
tiful and unchanged. Five cars of Naval
Oranges were sold at auction and the prices
obtained were low, as all of the fruit was
more or lers green and lacked sweetness.

and standards at CocÂ®$l 30. A few small lots
of fine Grape Fruit were offered and sold from
$3 25 to $4 per box, according to grade.
The rain has about ended the Berry season,
and as there were no fresh supplies received,
the quotations are omitted. A few small lots of
Vertiel Grapes came la and sold at $1 25 per

All- grades Butter and Egg* are cheaper, as
the production is steadily increasing, owing
to the toft, moist weather, and prices may be
even lower before the end of . the week.
. The market is slenderly supplied with most
kinds of garden Vegetables and prices are ac
cordingly high. . Seasonable varieties of fruits
are in good supply, with prices normal. Cran
berries have suddenly become scarce and Â¦ are
dearer.
Poultry and Game have changed but little
since last week. All indications point to a
good supply of Turkeys for Christmas and
prices will undoubtedly be lower than they
were just before Thanksgiving. Meats and
Fish have not changed for weeks.

When the flames became too fierce
for the firemen to use the life lines,
the Jumping net was brought into play.
From the fifty-foot height of the build
ing men and women were thrown into
the net held by the gallant men of the
fire department.
The police squad preserved order,
just as they do at real fires, and the ex
citement for half an hour was at fever
point.
As Manager Ackerman of the Grand
Opera-house .said .to Assistant Chief
Dougherty, after the rehearsal: "It is
the greatest thing ever seen ' on any
stage. Talk about 'Ben Hur.' If the
New York managers ever see this,
they would want it and could coin a
fortune out. of it. It beats anything I
have ever seen for excitement."

as follows: . . .
With a clang and a dash, up came the
fire engine, truck, chemical engine and
then* Assistant Chief O'Brien in his
buggy. The engine was in complete
working order, and pumped, as if the
very theater was threatened. The
firemen ran up their truck ladders and
scaled the heights with the scaling lad
ders. While men and women cried for
help, the firemen crawled like cats
over the building. Down they came
with men and women clinging to them,
sliding down the life lines with light

said that the. appointment of General
Wood would lower the moral standard
of the army."
"I can only say," added the general,
"that In the published interview my
words', were greatly enlarged upon,
and that I have been credited with
making an uncalled-for remark, which
cannot only be detrimental to myself
but to the army."
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18.â Secretary
Root to-day requested Brigadier Gen

the department if he was quoted cor

say- that the President's appointment
of Leonard Wood to be major general
is generally unpopular with army men
and that such appointments tend to
unsettle the army and injure its mor
ality. The general was asked to make
such explanation as he may deem
proper.
