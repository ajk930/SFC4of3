MAKES A SERIOUS CHARGE^
SUFFERINGS BEGIN.
His log, in part, is as follows, and tells
tm own Btory;
FOXES HOWL ABOUT HIM.
The Courtney Ford ran ashore September
SO. 1302, on Izcnbek Island, Alaska. Two
men were drowned when she struck the
btach and two others were drowned later
by the capsizing of a boat. After the
boat had etruck. Captain N. E. Burgeson
found that somebody had placed a piece
of Iron inside the compass, rendering it
useless. The schooner stranded during
thick weather, after she had been navi
gated for three days by dead reckoning.
The captain and crew, after camping
athore for about a week, were picked up
by a passing vessel and landed at Seattle.
William Ode was left behind as watch
man. Ode's dead body was found recent
ly by revenue cutter officers. The help
lor which he waited in vain left here a
few days ago. when the schooner Carrie
*cd Annie sailed for Izcnbek Island with
wrecking apparatus aboard. The Court
ney Ford was owned by C. A. Hooper &
Co. of this city.
Odes log commences October 4 and ends
with a. faint pencil scrawl, in which he
tells of the approach of a welcome death.
It recounts the routine of duty to which
be adhered as long as It was necessary
and he was physically able. He describes
the howling of the hungry foxes which
surrounded his ice-bound quarters and
writes with no note of complaint of the
gradual conauering of bis body by the
dread scurvy and of his lonely fight with
death. He tells of Bufferings from the ele
ments, of fruitless . struggles toward
"where he expected to find fellows, of the
irrowlr.g weakness which gradually
claimed his robust frame ai.d rendered
impossible the effort necessary to light a
fire or crawl a few feet for water. He
had rheumatism, and merely mentions it.
He had toothache and endured it pa
tiently.
. -Jn'rhe simple language of a practical
man' . Ode sers down the happenings of
that quarter year. To incidents which
*ould have unseated the reason of most
men .. he . refers in the most casual way,
mentioning them in the same matter of
course vein a*, he tells of the wind's di
rection. His own sufferings he catalogues
in short, crisp sentences, and euch mor
alizing as he finds occasion for is dis
posed of briefly ar.d to the point. His
Ftory is a calendar of events, some of
them trifling in- themselves and unworthy
of notice under other surroundings. They
all lead, however, to one end and that is
the extinguishment of William Ode. sai
lor. The tale reaches the world complete,
but fpun as it was in one of nature's
ice-barred prisons by the lone prisoner
himself, It makes one of the grimmest
yarns that ever came out of the north.

xhatic realism and deep human pathos the
pimply- told account of the last four

The occupation of the ground by Rus
sian troops in March, 1301, resulted in the
latter being confronted by a body of
British infantry and the situation for a
time was extremely delicate. Diplomatic
intervention relieved the tension and tho
matter was referred to arbitration.
TIENTSIN. July 2.â The final award In
the Â¦ Anglo-Russian railway dispute hap

every claim put forward by the British

the Tientsin-Peking Company construct
ing a siding at Tientsin, on ground which
Russia claimed It had acquired prior to
the troubles in 1900.
Meanwhile, and until the petition Is re
ceived here, there is nothing more to be
done, it is said. Through the newspapers,
in an unofficial but quite adequate maif
ner, the governments of the United States
and Russia have acquainted each other
with their respective attitudes concerning
the Jewish petition, and all that remains
is to await the working out of the pro
gramme.

Miss Mary McCann of Rockaway
Beach was dashed by the wind against
the Flatlron building and so badly In
jured that she had to be taken to the New
York Hospital.
Among the places struck by lightning
or damaged by the gale were the Church
of the Divine Paternity, on Central Park
West; the Hotel Normandy, the Lancaster
Apartment House, , on West .End avenue,
and the Arbuckle building on Water
street.
Fanny Kinsley, a six-year-old child,
frightened by the storm and blinded by
the rain, ran directlV under a swiftly
moving wagon and was killed., John
Dominick, a dock laborer, was knocked
into the East River by a flying plank and
drowned. The wind swept the embers of
a bonfire over the pinafore of three-year
old Clarence Hadden and he was burned
to death.
NEW YORK, "July; 2.â A terrific storm
here to-day followed a period of most In
tense heat. There were four deaths from
the heat to-day; and a. 'score or. more of
prostrations. Already^ three deaths di
rectly traceable to {the , storm^ have been
reported, and many persons caught in the
fury of the wind were injured.
At one time the gale, blew. at the rate of
seventy-two miles an' 'hour, in the upper
part of New Y<Jrk, /^according to .,^the
Weather Bureau.- 'Â¦; Many places 'were
struck by lightning,- which played contin
uously for an hour, or more.
A great section of the Manhattan Field
fence was blown down and there .was al
most a panic among; the .thousands *. of
men and womenwho^bad gathered at the
polo : grounds adjoining to witness I the

The Bronx was the"' first*, to ; feel . the
gale's effects and the lower 'portion', of
that borough, Buffered most. A wind of
extremely high velocity swept from. west
to east, uprooting trees, smashing plate
glass windows,"' blowing pedestrians ' from
their footing and doing all kinds of.dam
age. Apparently the storm was In two
divisions, one advancing down the valley
of the Hudson River and' the other ap
proaching 1 from Long Island Sound, which
was torn into a fury by the force of the
wind. These two divisions met over the
Bronx with dazzling displays of electric
ity. The first windstorm was followed by
a heavy fall of rain, like a cloudburst in
character, and a shower of large, hail
stones.

FOXES HOWL ABOUT HIM.
The Courtney Ford ran ashore September
SO. 1302, on Izcnbek Island, Alaska. Two
men were drowned when she struck the
btach and two others were drowned later
by the capsizing of a boat. After the
boat had etruck. Captain N. E. Burgeson
found that somebody had placed a piece
of Iron inside the compass, rendering it
useless. The schooner stranded during
thick weather, after she had been navi
gated for three days by dead reckoning.
The captain and crew, after camping
athore for about a week, were picked up
by a passing vessel and landed at Seattle.
William Ode was left behind as watch
man. Ode's dead body was found recent
ly by revenue cutter officers. The help
lor which he waited in vain left here a
few days ago. when the schooner Carrie
*cd Annie sailed for Izcnbek Island with
wrecking apparatus aboard. The Court
ney Ford was owned by C. A. Hooper &
Co. of this city.
Odes log commences October 4 and ends
with a. faint pencil scrawl, in which he
tells of the approach of a welcome death.
It recounts the routine of duty to which
be adhered as long as It was necessary
and he was physically able. He describes
the howling of the hungry foxes which
surrounded his ice-bound quarters and
writes with no note of complaint of the
gradual conauering of bis body by the
dread scurvy and of his lonely fight with
death. He tells of Bufferings from the ele
ments, of fruitless . struggles toward
"where he expected to find fellows, of the
irrowlr.g weakness which gradually
claimed his robust frame ai.d rendered
impossible the effort necessary to light a
fire or crawl a few feet for water. He
had rheumatism, and merely mentions it.
He had toothache and endured it pa
tiently.
. -Jn'rhe simple language of a practical
man' . Ode sers down the happenings of
that quarter year. To incidents which
*ould have unseated the reason of most
men .. he . refers in the most casual way,
mentioning them in the same matter of
course vein a*, he tells of the wind's di
rection. His own sufferings he catalogues
in short, crisp sentences, and euch mor
alizing as he finds occasion for is dis
posed of briefly ar.d to the point. His
Ftory is a calendar of events, some of
them trifling in- themselves and unworthy
of notice under other surroundings. They
all lead, however, to one end and that is
the extinguishment of William Ode. sai
lor. The tale reaches the world complete,
but fpun as it was in one of nature's
ice-barred prisons by the lone prisoner
himself, It makes one of the grimmest
yarns that ever came out of the north.

The occupation of the ground by Rus

latter being confronted by a body of
British infantry and the situation for a
time was extremely delicate. Diplomatic
intervention relieved the tension and tho
matter was referred to arbitration.

NEW YORK, "July; 2.â A terrific storm
here to-day followed a period of most In
tense heat. There were four deaths from
the heat to-day; and a. 'score or. more of
prostrations. Already^ three deaths di
rectly traceable to {the , storm^ have been
reported, and many persons caught in the
fury of the wind were injured.

divisions, one advancing down the valley
of the Hudson River and' the other ap
proaching 1 from Long Island Sound, which
was torn into a fury by the force of the
wind. These two divisions met over the
Bronx with dazzling displays of electric
ity. The first windstorm was followed by
a heavy fall of rain, like a cloudburst in
character, and a shower of large, hail
stones.

covered the distance of 370*4 miles in 6
hours 36 minutes 9 seconds, including the

Only one minute divided them. â¢ It is

jVe vented an official explanation as to the
cause; of- Morse'js retirement. No one in
the local offices knew what prompted him
â¢ t.<J resign. A dispatch from Houston last
night stated that Morse had probably
nuide financial connections in the East.
The operating and passenger depart
ments of, the -Southern Pacific Company
are engaged in preparing a schedule un
der which a new train may be placed on
the Central Overland route. It has been
decided that the present morning's train
time of departure from here shall be
cliiingfed to some hour between noon and
two o'clock. It is probable that the new
train will be made a flyer and carry mail.
Another train '.will also be added to the
west bound service, connecting with the
west bound Rio Grande train so as to
overcome the present annoyance exper
ienced by passengers who have to wait
Hbout.-five hours in Ogden. To accomplish
this plan it is purposed to make the
l.'nion Pacific train a through one and to
have the 'new train arrive about the same
time- as the Rio Grande.

of to-day's session of the conference of
American rabbis was the paper by Dr.
M. I>. Margolis, the professor of Semitic
languages at the University of Califor

Jewish creed, and 'said: \
. If. as reformed Jews, we want to have a
creed, - we -.must and shall have a proper
ecclesiastical organization. Let us have the
synod as the keystone of our church.
Dr. Margolis then offered a motion that
a committee be appointed to draw up a
reformed Judaism creed and submit It at
the conference, with the idea of submit
ting It In 1903 to some body of the Jewish
church to be organized by that time, with
legislative power. The motion was sec

WASHINGTON. July 2.â Captain Car
tie, the Auditor of the Treasury for- the
Postoffice Department, to-day made the
official estimate that the postal deficiency
for the fiscal year just closed will be
$4,617,203. The deficit for the previous fis
cal year was $2,961,170. This big increase
is attributed to the enormous increase' in
expenditures for the rural free delivery
service during the past year. The re
ceipts of the postal service for the year
were 5134,268,609 and the expenditures $138,-
SS3.S12. The deficiency In the free delivery
service is not definitely known, beyond
the estimate made weeks ago by . the
Postmaster General that It would reach
$227,000 by the close of the fiscal year. The
deficiency, however, may. prove consider
ably larger than that figure.
OMAHA. Neb.. July 2.â Rural free de
livery of mall throughout the West has
been practically ended by the recent rul
ing of Fourth'~A^sistant Postmaster Gen
eral Bristow, who has ruled that no free
delivery route shall be continued unless
100 families are served and 3000 pieces of
mail matter handled monthly^- This rgl
ing is the result of Bristow's recently an
nounced position on the rural delivery
question. "in which he declared that rural
delivery has been making too rapid
strides and must go slower.
Superintendent Rathbone of the West
ern division said to-day :-
Enforcement of that order will wipe out 90
per c^nt of the routes in this district, cum
prlMngfMinnesota. both Dakota*. Nebraska and
Iowa, and also will affect other. Western States
in the came way, especially Colorado, Montana,
WycmlnK and Utah. On examining the routes
In this district I find that few routes serve
more than seventy-five families. We will make
no attempt to enforce the order until the mat
ter can be taken up with Bristow.
All .field men have been called in for
consultation /ind a modification will be
asked for. Farmers throughout the States
affected are preparing- petitions, which
will be forwarded to Washington, asking
that the rule . not apply to thinly settled
Western States.

The Duke of Devonshire, the Lord
President of the Council, said it was
impossible now to give the exact scope
of the inquiry. Several heads had ''been
suggested by Chamberlain and Balfour.
The Government had determined that the
Inquiry' should be full and satisfactory.
His Lordship declined to enter further
upon the subject without a more explicit
and longer notice than Lord â¢ Rosebery
had seen fit to give in precipitating to
day's discussion. He ctould say that the
position of the Government at present
was somewhat different from that of
Chamberlain, but they did not conflict.
The whole Cabinet had agreed that the
time was ripe for an investigation of
the possibilities of a closer fiscal union
with the colonies.
LONDON, July 2.â Lord Rosebery In
the House of Lords this afternoon renew

propositions, making a further request for
information regarding the Cabinet's

ridiculed Colonial Secretary Chamber-
Iain's programme and said he did not
believe the Government intended to prose
cute an inquiry into the matter. The
allegations that such an inquiry was being
made were, said Lord Rosebery, merely
a cloak to screen the irreconcilable dif
ferences between the Colonial Secretary
and the other members of the Cabinet,
and he demanded to know whether the
inquiry would be individual or collective
and whether the results would be pub
lished.

The trouble arose over Mrs. Lamar'a

Mrs. Lamar he was not a dog catcher.
Finally she jumped to the ground and
with the aid of a gardener captured her
pet.
Learning of the cffalr. Lamar visited
the stable. Broker and . servant quickly
came, to blows. The coachman declares

ANGELS CAMP, July 2.â The largest '
fire that Angels Camp has experienced
for years started here at U o'clock to-day
and in an hour and a half had burned
twenty-four dwellings to the ground.
The fire started at the residence of
"Wolf Davis, a tailor, just ts the noon
whistles were blowing. The family had
just finished dinner when a crackling
noise between the ceiling and roof attract
ed their attention and It was then discov
ered that the fire had already gained such
headway that it was beyond control. Soon
after the alarm was given a large crowd
of men congregated and carried the most
valuable things from the building:.
A strong breeze was blowing and as thÂ»
water In the pipes was out Just at thiÂ»
time it. was only a few minutes until thÂ©
house next door was afire and soon up
the street. The flames quickly consumed
fl\e buildings, including the grocery store
and dwelling rooms of N: Mogolinsky and
family.' '. ..
Then the flames caught the- nouses
across the street and with a strong wind
they advanced so rapidly that the flrÂ»
department had no control over them and
the throng went to work retnovins: as
much as possible from the burning houses.* [
Goods of every description -were ; car
ried down to Angels Creek for safety.
It looked for a time as ir the whole
town would burn, but by the very hard 1
and heroic fighting of a large body of
men the blaze was' stopped at an alley
where the flames had often leaped across .
and caught to a row of houses on the oth

Linan, at - Chapman's trial, testified
that he told the performers to make their
songs "spicy." He admitted that one of
the dancers had some Innocently worded
signs on her, . but denied that they wero
attached in such way as to be suggestive.
H. B. _ Seeley made arrangements for
the vaudeville show with a theatrical
agent named Llnan and among the en
tertainers. Lirtan provided was Cora
Routt. The statements which Seeley
himself made as to what occurred were
much, milder than the description given
by Captain Chapman, who was subse
quently tried at police headquarters for
his raid. Chapman said that. one of the
women, scantily clad, danced on a table.
Mrs. Herbert Barnum Seeley was Miss
Lucia Mitchell, daughter of the late Ar
chibald Paul Mitchell of this city.. H. B.
Seeley is a grandson of the late P. T.
Barnum and inherited from the showman
an estate of about $400,000.
The notorious Seeley dinner, referred
to in reports at the time as a Pompelan
feast, was given by Herbert B. Seeley
at Sherry's on the night of December 19.
1896, in honor of his brother, Clinton Bar
num Seeley, who was to be married ten
days later. It became a celebrated occa
sion because of the raid which Captain
Chapman made on the banquet because
he had. heard that the vaudeville' enter
tainment provided was to be an Improper
exhibition.
NEW YORK, July 2.â Justice Truax, in
the Supreme Court, to-day appointed War
ren S. Burt referee in a suit brought by
Lucia Seeley against Herbert B. Seeley.
Thie papers on file did not disclose the
nature of the suit, as the pleadings were
not attached to Justice Truax's order,
but it is generally believed to be an ac
tion for divorce.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Littauer explained that at that time
Lyon had demanded the heaviest possible
deliveries on the contracts he had placed
with Littauer Bros, and they were unable
to furnish such quantities. Lyon asked
th.it Fampi^s be pent him of any similar
gauntlets which Littauer Bros, might
have on hand or would be able to produce
more rapidly than they could the United
States army standard. In his letter of
May IS Littauer. after detailing his stock
on hand that would be available for such
purposes, made the reference to Luding
ton as quoted. He said that he offered
the suggestion in regard to seeing Lud
ington so that he might be able to explain
to the quartermaster general that it
would b<- Impossible for.his firm to supply
to Lyon a greater quantity of the stand
ard gauntlet.
Do you think It advisable that I fchould call
on Ludinirton in reference to any other than
the standard gauntlets?
GLOVERSViLLE. N. Y., July 2.âCon
gressman Littauer's attention was called
to-day to the letter which he wrote to
Lyon on May 18, 189S, in which he asked:
General Ludington further said that
Littauer never called upon him concern
ing any glove contract, and added:
This Is the first time jhat I have heard or
r"s4 cf Ills name being connected with any con
tract lor giove6. or of his being connected in
any way with Lyon.
SYRACUSE. N. Y., July 2.â General
Marshal I. Ludington, retired, to-day
said in reference to the glove contract be
tween the Government and E. R. Lyon.
in which the name of Congressman Lit
tauer has been mentioned:
The transaction occurred during the busiest
part of the war. when I was loaded down with'
work. The bids were opened In my office and
awarded to the lowest bidder, except in cases
where it was necessary that the goods should
\>ft delivered immediately. I knew Lyon was a
(Joveriumnt contractor. Mr. Llttauer I knew
also as a very pleatant and agreeable gentle
mun. I knew also. *s did every one in Wash
ington, that he was a manufacturer of gloves,
but I never knew that he was interested with
Mr. Kyon ic business or that he had any con
nection with him.
The papers in the allegations about the
contract for gloves have been referred
to Judge Advocate General Davis, who
wjll examine them to ascertain what ac
tion, the War Department should take,
from a legal and military standpoint.
Some allegations have been made that
the glove contract was let to Lyon even
after a lower bid had been made, but
this could not be verified at the depart
ment. While one section ot the Revised
Statutes prohibits contracts which will
inure to the benefit of a member of Con
gress, another section excepts a con
tract made with a corporation in which
the Congressman has shares of stock.
It is said at the War Department that,
no matter what may be the outcome of
this matter, the statute of limitations will
lie against a criminal prosecution, but
this will prevent civil proceedings for the
restitution of money involved in the con
tract.
WASHINGTON, July 2.â Secretary Root
to-day had a conference with General
Humphrey, quartermaster | general, and
Colonel Patten, who has charge of the
clothing supplies for the army, regarding
the contracts for gloves with E. R. Lyon,
who. it is claimed, obtained his supply
of gloves from the firm of which Repre
sentative Llttauer of New York is a
member. The Secretary has directed that
an . inquiry be made int,o the whole sub
ject, with a view of ascertaining whether
any officer made contracts in violation
of the statutes, and for such other infor
mation as may be obtained.

The perfection of the optical image of
a star testifies to the lack of damaging
currents with reference to the object glass
used. It records all the waves below a
certain wave length. Similarly, the
amount of bodily motion registers all
those above that length.â New York Sun.
It is easy to make these waves visible
by taking out the eyepiece and putting
one's eve in the focus of the instrument
when the tube is pointed at a bright light.
It is further possible to measure their
effect by carefully noting the character
of the spurious dJsc and diffraction rings*
made by a Etar, and the extent of the
swing of the Image in the field of view.
By. combining the amount of confusion
with the degree of bodily* motion of the
resulting image the definition at any time
and place can be accurately and absolute
ly recorded.
Studies directed to that end have' re
sulted in a knowledge of the conditions
which constitute good or bad seeing.
â¢ â¢ â¢ The basis of the matter lies in the
well-known fact that systems of waves
traverse the air, several of these systems
being present at once at various levels
above the earth's surface. The waves
composing any given system are constant
In size and differ for the different cur
rents all the way from a fraction of an
inch to several feet in length. If me dis
tributing wave be less from crest to crest'
than the diameter of the object glass, the
image is confused by unequal refraction
from the different phases of the wave: if
,the wave be longer than this, a bodily
oscillation of the whole image results. The
first is fatal to good definition, the second
makes accurate micrometrlc measure
ment difficult.

wherein children may lie to parents, pu

A servant, if he or she fears from frank

Leslie Brown, a 12-year-old newsboy, who
resided with his parents at 1510% Broad
way, purposely shot himself in the hand
and within a week died of blood poison
ing. Efforts to save his life were to no
avail, as he kent the. m'atter concealed
from his parents' ( knowledge until three
days after it occurred.
Brown was a bright lad and had been
attending the Spring Valley school. His
father/John Brown,. is an auctioneer. Re
cently Leslie purchased a 22-caliber .: toy
pistol, which he laded with wads, instead
of bullets. One week ago Wednesday he
was playing with the weapon and, hold
ing it in one hand, -discharged It at the
other. The wound .seemed to him trivial
and, swearing his two smaller brothers to
secrecy, he cave the injury no' attention
and went his way. > ' .
On last Saturday one of his brothers
Informed Mrs. Brown ! of what had hap
pened. Tho. mother looked at the hand,
which appeared ' to have been scarcely
scratched, and treated the shooting slight
ly. , A physician, however, was summoned
and made an examination. .The latter re
alized the seriousness of the wound - and
stated that it would be hardly possible
to save the lad's life. That evening young
Brown was seized" with convulsions and
his Jaws locked. He grew rapidly worse
and Drs. Jones and Petrie were called.
Neither could do Â¦ anything to alleviate
the little patient's sufferings and he lin
gered until Wednesday at noon, when he
died. ' '

OAKLAND, July 2.â Suit for divorce
was Instituted to-day in behalf of Mrs.
Jennie W. Morgan against Robert Mor
gan, the San Leandro undertaker. She
alleges desertion as the cause of her com
plaint and says thaKMorgan left her in
1897. Mrs. Morgan also claims that trt3
business conducted by Morgan was es
tablished with her money and that he is
only acting as trustee for her and she
asks that it be declared her own exclusive
property. It is expected that this part of
her petition will be vigorously contested
by him.
Suit for divorce was begun to-day by
Mrs. Martha Betancue against Joseph

VALLEJO. July 2.â Michael Carroll of
the U. S. S... Boston has been selected as
king of the carnival to be held here
to-morrow night. The selection was
made yesterday when the votes which
residents of Vallejo have been cast
ing for "King" for the last two weeks
were counted. The result showed that
Carroll received 1510 votes and Michael
Campbell, another popular resident of
Vallejo, rece.ived IjOS.
* The selection meets with universal ap
jiroval. as aside from the feeling en
gendered by the contest, every one is
willing to concede that "Mike" Carroll
will make a king of the "first water." He
is so well-known here that his every sug
gesticyi must meet with approval. The
;>ortly sailor's suggestions are usually of
the kind that bring forth the best re
suits, so it is expected that the wind-up
of the celebration of the nation's birth
day In Vallejo will prove^to be the most
successful held here in years.
"King" Carrcll, just as soon as the
news of his election was given out, Eelect
ed the following as the members of the
royal family: J. Gorham Nevins, James
A- Bruce, Jeff Aspanwall. T. B. Haggerty,

The contract was then read and ap
proved. S. J. Hendy announced that
work would be pushed forward without
an hour's delay Replying to General
Chipman, Mr. Hendy said that postpone
ment of operations until Thursday of
next week would render it necessary to
eliminate the grand arch from the scheme
of decoration and illumination.
It Is understood that $20,000 of the sum
appropriated by the State will be re
served for payment of construction and
illumination of the arch. Mr. Hewitt,
who designed the arch, said it would ex
cel in beauty and effect all features of
Illumination hitherto^resented in thjs or
any other city of tKTUnited States. The
Hendy bid of J20.000, including current, is
within Mr. Hewitt's original estimate.
If public-spirited generosity character
izes future contributions to the encamp
ment fund the arch or grand . court of
honor wJll be supported by illumination
on Market street, from Second to Tenth.
CONTRACT IS APPROVED.
H. C. . Dibble and E. S. Salomon con
tended that the money was appropriated
and set aside by the executive committee
at the session Wednesday evening, when
George Stone and Horace Wilson were
authorized to close the transaction with
Mr. Hendy on the basts of $20,000.
Chairman Stone ruled that the appro
priation had already been madc and set
aside.
Attention of Chairman Stone was called
to the following paragraphs in the rules
a^id regulations of the executive com
mittee:
Nine members shall constitute a quorum for
transacting all business other than making
appropriations of money. No appropriation ot
money to a committee shall be made except at
a regular meeting and by an affirmative vote
of a majority of the committee.
Hugh M. Burke moved that the con
sideration of report be postponed un
til next Wednesday evening and that all
members of the executive' committee be
notified that final action would then be
taken. The motion for postponement was
defeated.
The report was then adopted by the fol
lowing vote on a call of the roll:
Ayesâ Horace Wilson, Henry C. Dibble, E.
S. Salomon. Sol Caheti, Thomas Collins, W. K.

REPORT IS- ADOPTED.
Chairman George Stone of the general
committee and Chairman Horace Wilson

mination reported that they had, in com
pliance with instructions, conferred with

of the plans for the grand arch at the
intersection of Market, Kearny and Third
streets and were ready to report that the
readjusted plans would permit the con
struction of the arch and the supply of
the current for $20,000.
Edward S. Salomon moved the adoption
of the report.

8 qt>d T Drumm St.. Sao FroijcUco. Telephone Main 1646. Wholesale Cealers.THE surprising news comes from Honolulu that
the Territorial Legislature proposes to bar out
entirely, or greatly restrict, immigration from
the mainland of the United States. It is said that the
natives arc now in the majority and that they pro
pose to remain so,, at least until eliminated by race
suicide, and that to effect this they will exclude con
tinental Americans as rigidly as we exclude Chinese.
It is a novel proposition, and the lovers of nov
elty in the working of our system of government will
thank- the Hawaiians for furnishing a~curio. Under
our system the Territories have been entirely under
disciplinej and control by Congress, and we do not
recall anything in the organic act of the Territory of
Hawaii that permits the territorial worm to turn
against its disciplinarian. As it is desirable to find
out every possibility that may appear in our relation
to those recently annexed parts, we hope the Legis
lature will pass this exclusion law and give our Su
preme Court a chance to say again in what' dimen
sion and measure the constitution has been ferried
to the islands.
The constitution . says that Congress shall make all
needful rules and regulations for the territory and
other property belonging' to the United States, and
it may also dispose of the same. There has been
much juggling with that word "territory," but the
conclusion is that its use was derived from the
ownership by Virginia of the Northwest Territory,
which included Kentucky and part of Indiana;. Ohio

SECOND ballotings in the German elections
have resulted in much the same way as the
first The Socialists won twenty-five seats, and
these, taken with those gained in the first contests,
will give them eighty-one members of the new Reich
stag, as against fifty-seven in the preceding House.
Thus the result of the whole series of contests shows
an increase of 43 per cent over the Socialist vote of
1898 and a corresponding increase of power in the
imperial Parliament.
While the victories are undoubtedly pleasing to the
socialistic elements of the German people, they are
by no means alarming to the Conservatives, who still
hold a strong control over the Government. It is a
striking illustration of the inequalities of the Ger
man . system of suffrage that while the Socialists
polled upward of 3,000,000 votes out of a total of
8,000,000 they win but eighty-one scats, while the
Centrists, who polled less than 2,000,000 votes, won
upward of 100 seats. Berlin authorities estimate that
on the present basis oÂ£ voting the Socialists will
have to cast 5,000,000 votes before they can "elect
members enough to control the Reichstag. It is
that fact that gives comfort to the Conservatives and
enables them to look at the successes of the Social
ists without fearing for the consequences. .
There is one feature of the situation, however, that
gives to the Socialists more encouragement than the
victories of the year. It is the. evidence that social
ism is spreading from the "cities s to the country and
from North to Southern. Germany. Some of the
most surprising successes obtained by them in the
elections were in Saxony, where hitherto they had
but a comparatively small following. It is evident
that if the rural districts can- be won over to the
Socialist party they will be able in future elections' to
return a much larger number of delegates in pro
.portion to their votes, so that it will not require
5,000,000 out of 8,000,000 voters' to give them a .ma
jority in the Reichstag. It is in that hope they are
now exulting. Not long ; ago the . Kaiser referred to
Socialists as "fellows without a country."' Perhaps
he "may see them laying claim to all Germany before
many years and contesting with- him the question to
whom the country belongs.

MERMAID-A. C. T., La Cananea, Cal.
There is no California fish called the mer
maid. In fact, there is no such creature
as a mermaid, half woman, half fish, ex
cept in fable. Sir James Emerson Ten
proach in writing of the dugong or sea
cow has the following: "The rude ap
proach to the human outline observed in
the shape of the head of this creature
and the attitude of the mother while
suckling her young, holding it to her
breast with one filpper, while swimming
with the other, holding the heads of both
above water and when disturbed suddenly
diving and displaying her fishlike tailâ
these with her habitual demonstration of
maternal affection, probably gave rise to
the fable of the mermaid." In the old
and vulgar superstition, the mermaid was
a being of supernatural powers who was
capable of human loves and hates, and
of being wedded to a human lover. The
so-called mermaids that have been ex
hibited all over the world are manufac
tured in the Orient.
Two professors of music are to meet in Chicago

POLL TAXâ Subscriber, Alameda, Cal.
There was a time in California when
members of the National Guard were ex
empt from the payment of poll tax. When
the present constitution went into effect
the following section was Incorporated
and is now the organic law on the subject
of poll tax: "Sec. 12. The Legislature
shall provide for the levy and collection
of an annual poll tax, of not Jess than
$2, on every male inhabitant of this State
over 21 and under 60 years of age, ex
cept paupers, idiots, Insane persons and
Indians not taxed."
Mr. Fortune of Philadelphia has just returned
from an inspection of the fitness of the islands as a
home for American negroes, and it is said will make
a favorable and quite glowing report. Yet the
American negro soldiers who . have returned with
their regiments after a term of two or three years
say that they have the same unfortunate physical ex
periences as their white comrades in arms. In fact,
the American negro has become a tenjperate zone
person in physical and mental constitution, and is
no more immune to a tropical climate than the mem
bers of any other temperate zone race.
The American teachers who have been sent there
soon feel it, and by and by we will begin to get re
ports from them which show the sad effects of iso
lation and climate. Many of them are at points re
mote from Manila or any place where white people
live. Â¦ They are in the midst of native communities;
the most of them know neither Spanish nor the na
tive languages. The opportunity for ready com
munication with those around them comes only when
they have taught their own language to the people.
All agree that that is a slow process.. The effect of
distance from home and inability to talk with those
around them is almost as severe as that of solitary
confinement. Add to this the busy climate that
works every hour at the unstringing of nerves, de
struction of digestion and playing havoc with the
whole human system, and there is present a situation
appalling in its effect upon Americans.
OUR readers will remember our early and con
stant insistence that the physical and mental
effect of a vertical â¢inin the tropics must be
reckoned with in all our estimates of what we can do
in # our tropical possessions. Much has been said
about cruelty and oppression and unbecoming army
orders in the Philippines. Early in the history of our
operations army surgeons noticed the effect of the
climate upon members of their own corps. In the
hospitals they were attacked with momentary
aphasia, in which they would forget orders just given
snd- issue others entirely inconsistent with the first
and unsuited to the patient's needs. The War De
partment was stormed with complaints of hospital
administration, and the cause remained a mystery un
til a surgeon found orders that he remembered dis
obeyed by the steward and nurses and was confronted
with exactly contrary orders in his own handwriting.
It was known some time ago that military officers
in action issued the most extraordinary orders,
caused by mental injury inflicted by the vertical sun.
Recently the military journals have commented se
verely upon the apparent decline of military spirit
and honor in the islands. As the custodians of pub
lic money arm}' officers have acted with erratic dis
honesty, needlessly and foolishly appropriating it to
uses not consistent with a sane idea even of vice. To
account for this it has been said that the promotion
of company officers from civil life is responsible, and
that such appointees have not the training in honor
and conduct that is the purpose of military schools.
But it must be admitted that in respect of the ob
servance of the proper rules of military conduct dis
honors are easy between the two elements.
The matter is brought into prominent notice by
the. case of Lieutenant McCue, now under military
arrest at Fort Sheridan. It is revealed in his case
that he showed symptoms of erratic insanity, in
Manila after long and solitary service in Samar. The
features in his case do not differ materially from a
large number of others. The climate disorganizes
men morally, mentally and physically, and it is not
charity but common sense and common justice to seek
first for that as the cause of many of the events
which arc used as a pretext for reflections upon the
conduct of the army under that vertical and pitiless

GENERAL CANBYâ Inquirer, City.

SIR THOMAS LIPTON has the three Sham
rocks at New York, and the New York Yacht
Club has in the same waters the Constitution,
the Columbia and the Reliance. The presence of the
six competing champions has roused the sporting
blood of New York,, and an effort is being made to
get the racing authorities to put the whole fleet into
competition and make a race worthy of the great
cup.
There can be no question but what a race of the
three British challengers against the three American
defenders would be much better than a contest be
tween Shamrock III and the Reliance alone. There
would be more fun in it for the spectators and it
would afford a better trial between the contending
parties.
Some yachting enthusiasts grow rapturous as they
think of the possibilities of such a match. Thus
the New York Press says: "Viewing the suggestion
solely from the side of healthy sport, what a superb
fleet this sextet of sloops" would be!- There are no
single stickers in any other part of the' world like
them. There is not another single-masted vessel afloat
that carries! such spars, such canvas, such rigging as
any one of them.' Together, with all sail spread
and bending to the breeze, they -would present a
picture of power and beauty that never has been and
never again "will be paralleled. â¢* * * Wouldn't it
be a race, though? The three best types of the Yan
kee ship-builder against the three best types of the
British - ship-builder, and Y every "skipper in the : fleet
out to win not only against his own countrymen, but
against those not of his own soil!"
The only thing against the suggestion is that it is
too brilliant to have much chance of being realized.
Still it will be worth while for those who like it to
get in and work for it. There is a chance for a
record-breaking yacht race, and if it be lost the
present generation is not likely ever to see such
another.

PERSONAL MENTION.
Whether or not whales have a delicate sense of

if they have it is not always appreciated by the .sailors

they have a bad habit of scratching their backs
against the bottom of schooners. In the specific case
of the schooner Mary, one became -so tickled with

There is a very heavy grade for' several
miles on the coast line crossing the San
Luis Obispo mountains and many curves,
which makes slow time necessary. By
the cutting of a tunnel about three miles
long, which would be the longest in the
west, the company will be able to avoid
the worst part pi the grades, thus re
moving the necessity of two locomotives.
It is understood that the company has
other improvements on the coast line in
contemplation which will enable it to cut
down the time between San Francisco
arid Santa Barbara to eight hours.
SANTA BARBARA, July 2.â From a
high authority It has been ascertained
that the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany has determined to run a tunnel
through the San Luis Obispo mountains,
by which it will be possible to save about
two hours In time between San Francisco
and Los Angeles on the coast line.
For several weeks the railroad com
pany's engineers Have been making an
investigation as to the feasibility of run
ning a tunnel and it is said that they
have filed reports favorable to the pro
ject. The same authority stated that
work on the tunnel will be commenced
within a few weeks and t"hat it will cost
the company In the neighborhood of $2,
000,000.
REDDING, July 2.â The deep snow on
the Salmon River or Caribou Mountains,
in /Trinity County, is causing bear, deer
aniTother large game to frequent the low
er altitudes to the great discomfort of
miners and others living in the neighbor
hood of that mountain range.
Tuesday evening at the supper hour a
mammoth panther strolled leisurely into
the boarding-house at the. Strode mine
and struck terror to the hearts of the in
mates. There was a general stampede
and the animal had sole possession for a
time. Finally a couple of dogs caught
scent of the panther and made an attack
upon him. There was an interesting fight
for a few minutes, when the., panther
turned tail and escaped into the woods.
The same day, .while George L. Carr's
folks were going over Trinity Mountain,
they encountered* two large cinnamon
bears in the road on the divide. At first
the bears seemed inclined to maintain
their possession of the right of way and
make the Carrs go round. They thought
better of the matter, however, and scam
pered off into the forest.

IOWA has always held a high place in Republican
councils. Under the constitution of 1846 'the 'last
Democratic victory was the election of Stephen
Hewstead Governor. When the break-up of the
Whig party came the fragmentary political elements
of the State combincdÂ£>n James W. Grimes and made
him Governor and then Senator, and the State has
been steadfastly in the Republican column in national
elections since its electoral vote was given to Fre
mont.
As it is an agricultural State its position on the
tariff has always been of first importance to the party
that has held its unswerving allegiance for forty
seven years. The "Iowa idea," which has been much
discussed, was evolved by Governor Cummins, and
became of importance more for its letter than its
spirit! It proposed the reformation of all tariff
schedules which become a shelter for trusts. In
tended as a subjunctive statement of a policy, this
phraseology was seized upon by the free-traders as
an admission that a tariff is a promoter of trusts, and
in the last State campaign much was made of this
interpretation. But the Republican majority was so
large that, the opposition seemed hardly in the race
at all. Its strength in the Legislature dropped
nearly to the forlorn figures of the Civil War, and
the people reaffirmed their confidence in the party
which had commanded the destiny and directed the
development of the State from its pioneer period.
The Republicans have again met in convention and
have harmoniously declared the position of the party
and again ck> ven expression to its principles. On the
tariff they say that i% is a policy intended to prevent
foreign control of our markets and also to forbid
domestic monopoly, and is subject only to such
changes as are consistent with those two purposes,
to effect which rates should be lowered when neces
sary or raised when necessary. As to trusts the Iowa
Republicans utter no uncertain note. As industrial
instrumentalities they are not to be destroyed,* but
their monopoly is to be sternly prevented and pun
ished, 'and they are not to be permitted to strangle
competition. In other words, whatever power for
good is in them is to be preserved, and whatever
power for harm is to be destroyed. '
As we have already noted, the Iowa Democratic
platfcrm "deplores" and "deprecates," is "alarmed"
and "fears." It is noticeable that the Republican
platform rings with optimism and patriotism, is
flushed with hope, feels the impulse of the general
prosperity and is entirely unconscious that there is
any political oppoiitjon at all, for it. makes no men
tion of the Democracy or of Populism. It makes no
bid for the socialist vote, and stands resolutely by
the well seasoned principles of the constitution,
justly regarding the success achieved under them as
the best argument against their destruction. The
essence of free government being government by law)
its equal and impartial enforcement is declared to be
the mission of the party, since that means the up
holding of institutions. ' The gold standard as\ our
monetary measure is upheld, for it has established
the parity of all our currency and made every dollar
of it worth 100 cents in gold. In the convention,
after the platform was adopted, the chiefs spoke, each
giving in his allegiance and each his opinion of what
should be done if any of the contingencies appear for
which the tariff plank made preparation.
The feature of the convention was the ovation to
Senator Allison, who drew the tariff plank. Mr. Al
lison connects the present with the past, the prevail
ing peace and plenty with the strife and pinch of the
Civil War. His public career began when he entered
Congress in 1863. The Civil War was then two years
old. Lincoln was President. Every nerve of the
country was stretched and every muscle tense
in the great struggle for the preservation of
the Union. He shared in the impressive re
sponsibilities of that high and mighty time.
He s?w the ship of state weather the tempest,
and his public service has been unbroken until now.
When his term in the Senate expires in 1909 he will
be fourscore years of age and his service in both
branches of Congress will have covered a period of
forty-six years.
He is the only member of the Senate who as a
Representative saw Lincoln face to face, the only one
who officially assisted at his second inauguration,
and the only one who followed the dust of the mighty
President to its sepulture. He is a veteran of vet
erans, and the party that commands his service is
happy in his undiminished vigor of mind and body,
which gives to his leadership all of the courage and
confidence that characterized his earliest service.
What he approves in the economic policy of the
country stands in the strength of his years of expe
rience and in the light of his career, which began be
fore a majority of those who now vote the Republi
can ticket were born. The ovation which shook the
Iowa convention was well bestowed, and the thud of
it is felt fror.i California to Maine.

and Illinois, and was added to the cession lands

nance of 1787. â¢
There was for a time a struggle between "district"
and "territory" as the name of domain owned by the
Union but not in the enjoyment of statehood.
Maine was a district owned by Massachusetts, and
was the cause of the first fugitive slave law, because
the Maine lumbermen would steal negro slaves from
Massachusetts to work in the log camps. Vermont
was a district ' claimed by Massachusetts, New
Hampshire and New York. ' They all quitclaimed
and Vermont became a State. Territory triumphed,
and when Cass, Harrison and the other Governors
of the Northwest Territory were set over it they
were the Viceroys of a country larger than Europe
and with a white population smaller than that of
Monaco .or Andorra. The government of that do
main, the carving of States out of it^and its growth,
is all the romance of .history i^and is strung thickly
with novelties. But among them is none quite as
startling as the' proposition of a Territory" to exclude
from its borders citizens of the United States. There

"Well, Mr. Chapman, do you think that
a carman needs as much skill as a man
ramming blocks into position on Market

"Well, I should say not," Chapman re
plied. >
Answering Livernash, Chapman said
he considered that machinists, milkwagon
drivers, stevedores and teamsters all re
quired more skill than a carman.
"A teamster," Chapman explained, "has
to look out for other teams and pedestri
ans when he is on Market street, while a

LABORERS' WAGES.
W. J. McCloud and J. E. Nason, both
laborers for the United Railroads, testi

$2 50 a day. They said they were dissat
isfied with these wages, but though they
had petitioned for an increase they liad
been refused.
Dr. Walter Coffey, chief surgeon of the
United Railroads, said that he or his as
sistants examined all applicants for posi
tions on the cars. Their eyes and hearing
were tested and their physical condition
noted. To his knowledge. but five carmen
had died in the last year, though there
are 2400 members of the Hospital Associa

"Mr. Chapman, I would like to get
your definition of the word skill," asked
Livernash. "Take, for instance, a skilled
watchmaker. We do not say that a car
man needs as much skill as a mechanic of
this kind, but don't you think that a car
man needs as much skill as a brewer who
He did not consider that the streetcar
school system in vogue }n New York for
teaching carmen their duties a good one,
but believed the way men were broken in
in this city was much better. Then Chap
man and Livernash ; again took up the
question of skill as applied to the duties
of carmen.
He said, however, that the company was
not making as much money by the new
transfer system as formerly, but the
board of directors had adopted the new
system for the purpose of building up the
outside districts and were Â¦ laying the
foundation for larger business. He tes
tified that the extra men working as mo
tormen usually became regular men after
ten and four-fifths months' work; conduc
tors in eight and a quarter months, and
gripmen in seven and" two-thirds months.
The extra men on the San Mateo line av
eraged about $63 a month. He thought
a man was at the maximum point of
earning for the company . after two
months' employment. The time schedule
adopted about a year ago made it easier
for the carmen and they made moie on
their new runs. The cars, however, did
not run any faster and the company made
a little more earnings by this new sys
tem.
"Oh, from a public platform." replied
Moore, "well let me tell you that thou
sands of men have been hanged a thou
sand times from the public platform. Is
that where you get your Information?
Let me tell you, Mr. Livernash, Mr. Her
rin I have known for many years. He Is
a friend of mine and I do not intend to
hear him spoken of that way while I am
present." No more was said, and the
subject was dropped.
Manager Chapman was called the first
thing in the morning and he was on and
off the witness stand nearly all day. He
testified that there were 1470 regular car
men and 365 extra men; that the com
pany had ordered fifty new electric cars,
and that half of this number were to re
place old, worn-out cars, while the rest will
be used for increased traffic. About 100
more men -would be needed to run the extra
twenty-five cars. He could not estimate
the increased traffic for the next year,
nor would he admit that the streetcar
business was increasing at the rate of 7
per c;ent a year.
MORE TRANSFERS LESS MONEY.
The trouble all started by Livernash
asking Chapman how much money it cost
the company to run the claims depart
ment. Chapman replied that he did not
know, and referred htm to Tirey L.
Ford, chief counsel.
"I suppose you know that Herrin was
credited with being allowed $100,000 to
run the department, $10,00 for himself and
$90,000 for pacifying boards of Supervisors,
Mr. Chapman?" The latter pleaded ig
norance. Moore then said he had never
heard of it, and he did not believe It
"He has been several times' accused
of it from a public platform," continued
Livernash.
HERBJN'S PROTECTOR.
Since the opening session of the 'pro
ceedings Livernash must have asked
General Manager Chapman cf the road
about how much skill is necessary for
a man to operate a car without accident
at least twenty times, and every time In
return the operative head of the corpora
tion has come back with the same an
swer, "Experience and not skill is. neces
sary to run a car."
The man balancing a wheelbarrow
loaded with bricks, the milk wagon driv
er, the teamster perched on a load of sand,
all passed in review before Chapman on
the witness stand yesterday, and to each
Illustration Chapman answered that the
men in these callings needed more skill
than the man lugging at a gong and
handling a grip on streetcar lines in this
city.
The most sensational event of the day
was Livernash' s scoring of W. F. Her
rin's record as chief counsel for the old
Market-street Railroad. Livernash- said
that it was generally credited that Herrin
was allowed $100,000 â¢Â¦ a year to run the
law department, $10,000 for himself and
$90,000 to pacify boards of Supervisors. Af
ter this statement Attorney Moore was
on his feet i na second and referred to
Herrin as his personal friend and that
he would not countenance such remarks
in his presence.
The word skill was brought up again
yesterday by E. J. Livernash and talked
about for hours in the arbitration pro
ceedings between the carmen and the
United Railroads.

between King Menelik and the British

Alleged Pugilist Tries to Pose as
Jack Downey of Brooklyn
and Is Exposed.
SALT LAKE, Utah, July 2.â It took
Aurelio Herrera just three punches and
two minutes and ten seconds to effect
ually dispose of a fighter who claimed
to be Jack Downey to-night. The fight
was held on a stage in the open at the
ball park, and under the impression that
the Mexican's opponent was the clever
Brooklyn fighter, known as Jack Downey,
nearly three thousand persons were pres
ent.. When it. was announced that this
was not the case almost a riot was pre
cipitated. Downey tried to make good by
rushing the Mexican, but after about a
minute of this work Herrera's hay-mak
ing right connected and Downey went to
the floor. He was knocked down again
as soon as he got up, this time for six
seconds. Then the Mexican's right went
to the spot again and Downey went down
and out. He was out for over ten min
utes. Herrera hit him so hard the third
time that a bone in his hand was broken
and he will be laid up for some time.

Do You Want a Trunk
Corbett Eases Off in His Work.
Warm weather at Croll's Gardens, Ala
meda, yesterday caused James J. Corbett
and his staff of trainers to take matters
easy and seek the cool places. Jim did
but little work around the gymnasium.
He put in several hours playing shuffle
board. Since Eddie Hanlon and Harry
Foley left there has been a lull in the
life of the camp. The ring knowledge the
ex-champion imparted, to Eddie while the
little boxer was at Croll's Gardens served
the youngster well in his battle with
Benny Yanger Tuesday night.
It is Corbett's plan when he settles
down to real hard work to increase the
length of his boxing bouts with his train
ers, do more wrestling with his partners
and with a big swinging bag. Thus far
Jim has gone but ten rounds at a stretch
with his boxing mates. Baseball con
tinues the ex-champion's diversion and
whenever he can get enough youngsters
together to choose up sides there is a
game on the big field at Croll's Hotel.
Americans "Win Revolver Match.
PARIS. July 2.â The Union des Societies
de Tir has received the scores made by
the French in the French-American re
volver match. Comparison with the
American scores cables here show that
thp Americans have won the match -in
rpite of the fact that the conditions fav
ored the French, who are accustomed to
fhootlns at a smaller target than the
nue used in the match and at a distance
of fifty metres Instead of fifty yards,
which is under 46 metres.
- Dick "Cullen was too ..fast for- Jack
O'Frien/ and ': easily j earned the decision.
Jack- Â¦Moriarity.-and- Joe Podesta put up a
whirlwind battle for two rounds when the
former suddenly went out from a straight
right ;on* the Jaw./ Ed Kahoe; easily put
Jaclc: Murphy down for the ': count in a
round. â¢-^ f -i* r 'Â¦' : : Â¦"Â¦':::-
'Peterson was not himself. In\the first
three rounds, he was knocked down twice
by his burly opponent. He seemed to
have lost hla steam and Young hit -him at
will. In the fourth Peterson seemed to
a, waken, from his trance. He landed blow
after blow on the face and body of Young
and; had himiall but out. .This burst of
speed was too_ late, however, and the de
cision wa3 , awarded to Young. â¢
Dan; Sullivan; was a little too much for
Joe Reilly and after two minutes of fight
ing in the first round the latter went out.
He claimed a foul, but 'Â¦ Referee Milton
Hayes refused "to allow it. George Ellis

was in distress- after. the first minute of
fighting. His seconds threw up the

Al Young retaliated last night by earn
ing the over George Peterson,
his former conqueror. The men furnished
the main attraction of the evening's box
ing under the - auspices ..of the Lincoln
Athletic Club and put up a desperate bat
tle. Young was the aggressor in all but
the last round and won the decision by
a close margin. â¢

THE third annual tennis tournament
for the championship of the State
was commenced yesterday on the
Eiotel Rafael courts. Thirty-one
ilayers were in the competition, the
largest number in "a championship event
in years. Owing to the extremely large
entry list and the fact that onsiderable
time was wasted over the drawing only
the first round and one match in the 'Sec
ond were completed. This will make if*
necessary for some of the men to play
three matches to-day, which will be a
great hardship.
Most of the matches yesterday were
rather one-sided, as but few of the good
players vdrew together. The heat was in
tense and the players suffered greatly.
Several withdrew after playing" a couple
of hard sets.
Several matches were commenced in the
second round but only one was finished.
In it TV'. B. Collier boat Paul Jones in
straight sets. R. N. Whitney and Harry
Weihe started what would have been the
best match of the day. Weihe won the
first set easily, 6-L He had a lead of 1-0
when darkness set in. The match will be
completed this' morning. Walter Hunter
and Horace Mann also started - their
match in the second round. Play was
called after each had won a set, 6-4.
The closest match of the day was that
between Horace Mann and C. J. Smith.
In the fifth set the latter was attacked
with cramps but stuck gamely to the
game. Mann was terribly distressed also,
but lasted long enough to win.
Harry Routh and George Janes, two I
of the park experts, put up a good
match while it lasted. Janes, after play
ing two hard sets and losing both by a
small margin, withdrew.
Clarence Griffin made a creditable show- '
ing against Grant Smith. The first set was
close. The second went to Smith easily.
When the latter had the third almost won
he eased up a bit and Griffin fought des
perately. It went to Smith. 9-7. Following
is the tournament as far as played:

Score :
LOS ANGELES. July 2.â For two hours and
a quarter Los Angeles and Sacramento fought
for this afternoon's game. The visitors won
by hard batting. Eagan sending In two runs
ahead of him in the seventh with the longest
home run hie ever made here. Newton wan
touched up for thirteen hits. Cutter started
out badly but took a brace and held the hits
down nicely. Some of Levy's ruling eveked
the loudest and longest protests from the
spectators that have bÂ»en hÂ»ard on the dia
mond In two years. To-morrow's game may
change the order ,of the two leading clubs Â¦in
the pennnat race. Attendance 2300. Score:
' The Cripples got their only tally in the
second round. Kruger opened proceed
ings with a double-sacker to the center
garden. Gorton did not make good, but
Cooper hit the leather on the nose and
sent it out to left. Kruger made a pretty
sprint for the plate and barely beat the
German's throw from, left garden.
It appeared the home team would get no
runs, but the strain was too much for
the Cripples and they broke down in the
sixth. Irwin hit to center and stole the.
middle bag. L&Chy walked, but Pabst
forced him at second, making the second
out of the round. Irwin going to third on
the play. Then Pabst started to steal,
but Cooper caught him off the bag.
Brashear got excited while running after
Pabst and threw to third to nail Irwin.
The ball went wide and Irwin rounded the
last turn with ease.
In the eighth Irwin was given a life
on Reilly's error. Leahy laid down a
bunt. Pabst flew out and it seemed the
game would go on for a while longer, but
Lynch broke it up with a drive out to the
left garden. This brought Irwin in again
and ended all the trouble and the asony.

Cooper was also there in grand form.
He pitched as good as Herr, if not a
trifle better. The local never earned a run
off him and they would not have had. one
at all had not the errors been made at
the right time. They never got more than
one hit in an inning off the left-hander
and he walked only four throughout the
b*fttle.
The Cripples were in the game at
Recreation Park most of the time yester
day and came within a short length of
making: it three -straight. As It was, a,
couple of errors committed at the wrong
time by Brashear and Reilly, coupled with
a drive to the outfield by Lynch, let Uncle
walk in with the game all his own. ScorÂ»:
San Francisco. 2; Oakland, 1.
Uncle had Kddle Herr on his slab and
was forced to remark many times during
the game how glad he was to have coppol
out the husky youth. He never pitched a
game for Oakland like the one yesterday.
All the time the German lad threw his
best over the rubber. He controlled the
ball as good as any one who ever twirled
on the Eighth-street lot and but for one
Inning had the Cripples thinking about
how they could get at him.

Railroad deals are being made in every

railroads to reach this city.
The Oakland and East Side Railroad,

deeds includes a lot of property in the
town of Emeryville, which will be used
for its yards and depot grounds, the con
sideration being $24,735. A' second lot
of deeds conveys to the same corporation
number of lots in the Bryant tract in
the same neighborhood, the consideration
being $12,000. The Santa Fe system is
adding to its holdings In this neighbor
hood constantly. " â¢ \
The work of track laying on the con

ing a defaulter in the sum of $8000. Al
though he has been reported to have been
seen in several of the leading cities of
this country and rumored to be living
like a prince in Paris/ he has never been
apprehended. - - \
When White was appointed to the office,
he had the recommendations of all the
force in the Union Iron Works and was
also highly Indorsed by Henry T. Scott
and the late Irving M. Scott. He gave a
bond for only $3000 and as his peculations
amounted to $S000 the difference of $3000
will have to be made up by his employ
ers, under section 6, article XVI of the
charter, which * places the liability for
shortage of employes of the city upon
the heads of departments in which they

rived in this city on the belated overland
train last nicht, and next Sunday after
noon she will make her first professional
appearance on the stage at the Orpheum.
Mrs. Baer will aopear under her maiden
name, Mabel McKinley. She is noted
the country over as a soprano and has
declined hundreds of temptltic offers to
appear on the concert stage.
Mrs. Baer was aÂ° great favorite of the
martyr President and he used to enjoy
listening to her sweet voice. â¢ She was
frequently called upon to sing before the
visitors at the White House during the
lifetime of President McKinley, when she
made her home there.
Kven as a child Mabel McXinley was
known as a wonderful singer. Her musi
cal education began when she was very
young and she has been studying under
masters ever since. Even at tne present
time she devotes several hours each day
to her voice culture, and therefore she ia
in perfect condition to sing at all times.
For a long time theatrical managers all
over the country have vainly tried to In
duce Mrs. Baer, to go on the stage. She
has always refused the offers and it was
with the greatest difficulty that the Or
pheum management secured her consent
to sing in this city.
Mrs. Baer will open at the Orpheum
next Sunday afternoon and will sins in
this city for two weeks. Then she will
go to L*>s Angeles, where she will remain
for two weeks more. She is accompanied

of others, who are generally, counted as
"tho kindergarten" in Republican poli
tics.
The meeting lasted long 1 enough, but
nothing particular was accomplished, ex
cept to take a shot or twp at City Super
intendent of Streets Ott. Mr. Ott lives In
the Fourth Ward, aijd, while he supported
the successful ticket at the last municipal
election, he had the misfortune to get in
wrong at the primaries during the last
county fight. In doing so Ott incurred
the opposition of "the kindergarten" and
that little coterie of local politicians is
now out for his scalp.
The first of the fiscal year has come
and It is^the general opinion that if any
changes are to be made in the city gov
ernment they will be made during the
present month, and so, it was that the
meeting in question was held last night
to eee what Influence could be brought to
bear upon the present administration to
appoint friends of. the aforesaid "kinder
garten."
No particular conclusion was arrived at
and it is likely that there will be another
meeting in the near future, which wfll
also be pledged to secrecy. '"-J" '
Alleged to Have Bobbed Girl.
Eddie Jones, a 16-year-old boy, took May
White, a 15-year-old girl residing at C27
Minna street, out for a buggy ride and it
is alleged that while driving along the lad
threatened the eirl's life and forced her
to give him $10. Detectives were placed
In charge of the case and landed young
Jones in jail, where his name was placed
on the detinue book. Just what the charge
will be Js not stated and there seems to be
arf air of mystery about the case. The
affair. 'Â« said to have happened last Tues
day.
At the dose of the* exercises general
greetings were exchanged among the
clergy, the visiting graduates and- the sis
ters. Many walked through the grounds
I am thankful to you for your presence and
I hope that we shall meet again when Arch
bishop Klordan shall celebrate the pontifical
high tnaÂ» on July 12 in my church. Again I
thank you. v
the venerable priest.
Trembling with emotion, his eyes
dimmed with tears of joy. Father Kinsr
responded. He was reminiscent and spoke
feelingly of the early days of the convent.
In conclusion ha said:
It is well for you that you should often meet
your former teachers and should often visit
your alma mater. The oftener you meet. these
good sisters, the better it will be for you. They
were those who inculcated the principles that
help you now to keep high your heads in the
moral world. Â¦ .- ;â¢ ' - Â»/*.Â¦âÂ»
SAN QUENTIN PRISON. July t-
Knowing that his term of office is at an
end and that he is soon to pass into po
litical oblivion, Warden Martin Aguirre
Is now trying to wreak vengeance on
other officials and attaches of the penal
institution. He has discharged without
cause two of the most competent attaches
of the and does not deny, that
others high in position at the "penitentiary
h will soon get their walking papers.
; Sara Randolph, assistant to Captain
Hunter of the prison yard, and William
Beckley, one of the guards, were the first
to feel the sting of Agulrre's animosity.
Last night, or In fact the very day that
Aguirre's term expired, he cut those two
men off the payroll, and when a cause
i was asked for he curtly refused to give
any reason, but informed tho men that
they were not the only ones to go.
It was expected to-day would develop
several vacancies, but as yet no more
men have been notified of their dismissal.
From present indications,- however, there
in no doubt that Aguirre's list ts
long and that he has it up his sl*eve to
let out some more soon. In fact it la as
serted by those who- are apprehensive of
dismissal that Aguirre. through his
trusted lieutenants, has for some time
been laying traps for various guards at
the prison and even others in higher po
sition*. When seen to-night Aguirre said:
"Yes, I discharged that fellow Ran
dolph, and Beckley. too."
"For what cause? 1 *- was asked him.
"For my own reasons and no one
else's business."
"Do you propose to cut others off of the
payroll?". r 
"Is the sun liable to rise to-morrow?
was the answer.
After strenuous efforts to draw- out the
Warden on the real cause of dismissal as
well as by acquainting h.im with rumors
afloat he made the following statement:
"I dismissed Randolph and Beckley for
the good of this institution. They were
traitors to me, to my cause, and will be
traitors to any one who succeeds me. I
propose when I leave this institution
that it shall be in a better condition In
every way than*- when I came here. On
the dismissal of these two. men anil
others I shall leave the place in such a
condition as I just stated. As to whether
others will go. that remains to be seen.
There is a ring of men here whom I
have been friendly with, and who should
most certainly be my friends. They have
proven themselves otherwise, therefore
they must stand the consequences." 3jt5Â§l
Randolph and Beckley could not be
seen, but from some of their most inti
mate friends it was learned that the
only direct cause that they could attrlb
nte for their dismissal was the fact that
they had made a bet that Aguirre would
be. retired. Otherwise, it is claimed, the
two men have not been against the pres
ent warden.
Samuel Randolph has been an employ*
of tho penitentiary many years and
has always been a most thorough disci
plinarian, fie was assistant to Superin
tendent Egan when he had charge of the
prison ynrd. and when Edward Hunter
succeeded to the captaincy Randolph re
mained as^assistant. He has had many
scrimmages wlth^ unruly convicts and on
one occasion was shot.
William Beckley had Â»rot been at the
prison many years, but was always con
sidered a most competent guard.

SANTA . MARIA. July 2.â Hundreds of
people went out to-day to see the Pinal
Company's gusher, about nine miles from
here. Clogging sand had prevented its
activity for several days, but the drillers
promised to have It busy by to-dav. so
that all could see the spectacle ojf a
genuine gusher.
Their prediction was verified, and small
rocks were thrown up two hundred feet
In the air. The dammed gulley was used
to store the overflow, and much escaped
before the well could be capped. The
Western Union has also brought in a
gusher on the. Careago rancho, oil going
about fifty feet above the derrick.

Herbert Lansdown, the young man who
was with the girl when she shot herself,
related to the jury how many times tho
girl had attempted suicide. He said that
upon each occasion he had prevented her
from taking; her life.
"At one time she tried to jump in front
of a train." said Lansdown. "Only about
two weeks ago she started to take car
bolic acid. She always said she was tired
of life and wanted to die. Last Saturday
night when the shooting occurred I haÂ«l
stepped ahead of her to look at my watch
under the electric light. As my back was
turned I saw a flash and heard a report.
I naturally jumped. In doing so I slipped
and fell. Just after I fell the second phot
was fired and she fell. I think she lntond
ed the first bullet for me."
The Coroner's inquest was heia this af
fprnoon immediately after the autopsy
was performed and the verdict rendered
was that fchc died from a gunshot wound
self-inflicted with suicidal intent.

Ching Wo Sails To-Day.
The overdue British bark Samoena, which
was quoted on the overdue list at 30 per ctht
and was beginning to attract the attention of
reinsurance speculators, has been heard from.
She is out 120 days from Norfolk, Va., , for
Buenos Ayres, and under ordinary circum
stances should have reached her destination
some time ago. She was reported yesterday
as having put into Barbadoes for stiffening.
No details are given as to weather, but it Is
presumed that, being Insufficiently ballasted,
she found the weather there was more than
she could safely negotiate.
Since the arrival ot the Minnetonka gave the
local speculators such a heavy jar the reinsur
ance market has been quiet. The Spes. at 90
per cent, has been out too long to attract much
speculation. Â¦ She left London for Fremantle 173

â¢Special Dispatch to The Call
To-day's race was also marked by a
mishap to the Constitution. Soon after
the start she carried away the jaws of
her caff and the great steel spar, swing
ing forward, buckled in the center. The
mainsail was ripped clear across several
times and rendered practically worthless.
It wss the best mainsail the boat had
spread this season and was the third that
had been tried this year.
The Reliance received the severest buf
feting she has had since being launched.
The sea was a terrific one for racing
yachts, and when the yacht reached her
moorings it was noticed that she had a
big dent five feet long in the plating close
to the water line on the port bow. The
indentation was similar to that the Con
stitution sustained two years ago.
The Reliance sailed splendidly in to
day's event. The wind blew more than
twenty miles an hour and all three yachts
found that thev could not even carry
small working tODsails to windward, so
they went off under the three lower sails.
It was the stiffest breeze and the hardest
sea that the boats have been in since the
season's racing began and had there been
no accidents the record for a thirty-mile
triangular course would ha\'e been cut
down considerably. As it was, the Reli
anre. with no craft to push 'her and with
only a No. 1 jibtopsail hoisted in addition
to the three lower sails, came to the finish
lino from the second turn in 47 minutes 10
seconds, the fastest ten-mile leg ever
sailed.
There will be no more racing until the
yachts start on vne New York Yacht
Club's cruise.
Captain Miller of the Columbia thinks
that Olsen was stmck by the overhang of
the craft as it came smashing down and
knocked insensible. The Columbia came
into the wind Instantly. Two life buoys
were thrown into the water and the ten
der was put overboard. as quickly as pos
sible. Two men jumped into the tender
and rowed around for twenty minutes
ready to pick Olsen up if he came to the
surface. Three men ran up the mast and
watched closely from the spreaders for
any siprn of the unfortunate man, but
without success. Out of respect to the
dead man the Columbia withdrew from
tho race.
At 9 o'clock to-night the committee post,
ed the following bulletin at the club sta
tion:
"The Newport series for 90-footers will
not be finished." Â¦ ' -^ ,â¢â¢
NEWPORT, R. I.. July 2.â For the first
time in the history of the American 90
footers a fatal accident occurred to-day.
Carl B. Olsen, a seaman on the old cup
defender Columbia, was washed from the
bowsprit just before the yachts reached
the first turn in to-day's race and was
drowned. When the yacht lifted from the
big wave into which she had plunged
Olsen was seen almost under the stem,
clinging to the bobstayj but before as
sistance could be given him the sloop
dropped into another great comber and he
was not seen afterward.
A message was received in the city yes- i
terday by a well-known mining man stat- |
ing that the famous Esperan/a mine, in j
Camp El Oro, Mexico, which is regarded }
as one of the richest gold properties in 1
the southern republic, has been purchased J
jointly, by . the Guggenheim Exploration
Company New York and the Venture
Corporation of London.
The deal is said, to be the result of a
recent. trip to Mexico by E. A. Wlltsee,
formerly of this' city, who -secured an |
option on the mine In the name of the
Venture Corporation, which he represents
in this country. Since then a corps of
mining, engineers has made a thorough
inspection of the property. While : it is
impossible to learn the purchase price It
is the general opinion . among those ac
quainted with the Esperanza that the
sale will involve not less than $2,000,000.
The ; Esperanza mine has for years at
tracted the attention of mining syndicates
on both sides of the Atlantic,, and on two
occasions deals for its purchase were all
but effected. 'The last attempt to buy it
was about two years ago when a com
pany of London capitalists _ carried
through negotiations to a point where
only the favorable report of an expert
was necessary to close the transaction.
The English company employed Ross E.
Browne, well known in this city and a
man of considerable note in the mining
world\ to inspect the property and at thr.
last moment, after reporting favorably
upon Its wealth, he condemned it as an
investment on the ground that the com
pany which controlled it was overcapi
talized. The sudden turn in the deal was
a subject, of considerable comment
throughout the world, for concerned in
the deal were men of mining prominence
like John Hays Hammond, Henry Brat
nober and others representative in the
financial interests of the London stock
market. Recently Mr. Hammond became
general manager of the Guggenheim p:x
ploration Company, which is an import
ant medium in the latest reported pur
chase. The property Is among the best
equipped mines in the world and operates
a 120-stamp mill.
At Alcatraz Landing she took on thirty
three barrels of oil, to get which she
made the call there, and at 4:30 p. m." re
sumed her trip in company with the tug
Relief, which will convoy her until to
morrow morning, when the Ramona will
be left to go it alone to San Diego.
The ferryboat Ramona, which left
here on Wednesday for San Diego, ar
rived at 3 p. m. yesterday at Alcatraz
Landing. She encountered very heavy
weather on Wednesday night, the wind
acquiring a velocity of more than sixty
miles an hour. In spite of wind and aea,
however, and notwithstanding the fact
that the Ramona was built for servlce_ in
summer waters and neither intended nor
designed for ocean voyaging, she came
through the ordeal unscathed, fulfilling
all of the strength and seaworthiness
promised by her builders, the Risdon Iron
Works. '-r'X.'.'i

YELLOW F\OSES
Â¦Â¦ ' . By Franz Mortelmans
x his picture shows a bouquet of yellow roses, nearly life si*e,
/in a dark blue jardiniere, standing out Clear from a dark background.
It is a reproduction of an original oil painting ,by Franz Mortel-
mans,', the distinguished painter of Belgtom. It won a gold
medal for him at the Brussels Exposition in 1890.
i Franz Mortelmans was born in Antwerp in 1865, and is consid-
ered by many the greatest living painter of flowers. His father was
a painter of artistic tastes, whose greatest joy was the progress and
education of his children in the arts he loved so wellâ painting and
music. It was his habit to take them frequently on excursions to
the woods in search of flowers. Nothing pleased the little Franz
more than to draw crude forms in the dry earth and sand. Dis-
â¢ playing unusual aptitude in outlining flowers and still life, at the
early age of 11 he went to the academy to become a decorator and
scene painter. At the age of 16 he sent a canvas to the biennial
salon at Goud. Another, exhibited in London, sold for 40 pounds
sterling, being the only Belgian picture purchased. After spending
two years in the army he studied at Verlat, and at the Institut
Superieur. In 1889 he exhibited at the Exposition of Ghent and
> ' received governmental reward. In 1890 the same honor was granted
.him at Brussels. His studio is now in Antwerp, and his paintings
* .- are in demand throughout Europe and America. The Queen of
Belgium recently purchased one of his rose pictures. He is a lover
/ of sport, and he is frequently seen in the country, followed by two
Jogs, giving free rein'to his ever-working imagination.

The fruit market was quite active, there be
ing a steady demand locally and a fair Inquiry
for shipment on the Portland steamer. There
was a scarcity of Peaches, and the best ship
ping stock was. eagerly sought after at prices
ranging from 73c to 00c. Stock In > large open
boxes and baskets, too, cleaned up quickly at
higher rates. /Apricots sold off .well, but- as
supplies - were ample prices were no 7 higher.
Bulk stock .was in fair request among canners
and prices still had a wide range. The top
quotation was obtained only for the best yel
low. Cheap Apples and Pears were abundant,
but fancy stock was scarce and steady at full
figures. Figs continued in free supply and
prices of double-layer- packages declined. Re
ceipts of Cherries are steadily decreasing, but
there is a lot ' of overripe stock coming in,
which accounts for the. continued low prices.
Melons were 'offering freely and moved off well
owing. to the hot weather. Another carload of
Watermelons arrived from Coachella and prices
were easier. 'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ Small shipments of Grapes from
the Mint ' place found > ready. . sale - at previous

NEW YORK, July 2.â Another speculative
anticipation was disappointed by the action ft
to-day's market. This was that with the Penn-
Fylvania stock subscription and the semi-an
nual requirements on the money market out
of the way tome speculative Interest in stocks
wouid be aroused. To-day's money market re
flected clearly enough the reflux of funls after
the stringency Incident to the settlements.
Some doubt is felt over the showing of the
weekly bank statement, which will be pub
hshetl to-morrow owing to the Saturday holi
day. It Is said that this will show the effects
of the large operations Incident to the begin
ning of the fiscal year, as was the case with
returns of the Bank of England and the Bank
of France, which were made to-day. Both In
stitutions showVd a decline in reserve, the
English hank of Â¦. nearly $2,000,000 and the
French bank a slightly smaller amount, and
both Institutions phoned an enormous expan
sion of credits. Hut the process or repayment
of these extended accommodations was pro
oe<<Jing both in Paris and London. In New
York the maximum call rate to-day was 4'i
PÂ«t tent, compared with 0 per cent yesterday
unJ 10 per cent on Tuesday. A bank statement
unrax'.rable on its face is not likely therefore to
be a factor in the speculation. The easing
money market fallÂ«?d to help the stock market.
There wai> no urgent pressure to sell, but
the buying demand was almoct impalpable and
prirrs satrccd heavily throughout the session.
The approach of the holiday was a positive in
fluence on the dullness and especially as many
members are preparing to leave town to-night
until next week. It would be difficult to hit
upon any of the Tactcr* as the dominant cauio
<:i the weakness, but rentlment In speculative
cecuritie.8 over the future of values It undoubt
edly discouraged. London reported some sell
ing of Americans on fears of a disturbance of
our relations with the Russian Government, but
there was no trace of this feeling In New
Ycrk. Reports of plans of â¢ reorganisation for
additional Industrial combinations and- the
terms proposed created a distinctly bad Im
pression, although the securities affected arc
not dealt In on the Stock Exchange. The weekly
review of the iron trade, the favorable news
from the crop region and the day's reports of
railroad earnings, including the Pennsylvania
decrease for May, effected no assistance in ad
vancing prices.

CHICAGO. July 2. â There was only a small
trade In wheat, owing to.the fact that the

Ing prices were weak on heavy rains In the
Red Biver Valley and on the break of the
blind pool at St. Louis. September being Vi |
6%c to H'Â§%c lower at T5 to 75Vic. Com- i
mission houses were good buyers at the de- j
cline and with only light liquidation the mar- Â«
ket advanced moderately the first hour. Sep
tember selling up to 75VjC. after which prices
held comparatively steady until the closing ;
hour. A renewal of tho selling pressure
caused weakness late In the day and the close
was at the bottom, with September %@%c
lower at 74$ic -
Corn was rather unsettled, with business
niostly local and of an evening up character.
The market again declined late In the session
along with wheat and September closed %c
Â° Oats a were' extremely dull and prices kept
within a narrow range The close was steady,
with September a shade higher at 3J%@ja%c

Chicago Grain Market.
G. H. Hecke telephoned in from the
Byron Jackson orchard that nearly all the
plums have dropped, many prunes and
peaches are on the ground and the pear
crop has also been very badly injured.
H. W. Gregory telephoned from Winters
that apricots are nearly all on the
ground, pears have suffered badly and
peaches not so bad as was expected. J.
L.. Harlan of Solano County told 'Gregory
that he had 1000 boxes of peaches on thÂ«
ground.
The air was kept filled with clouds of
dust, branches were wrenched from the
trunks of trees and in many instances
big trees went clown before the fierce)
gale. The wind is still blowing from tha
north and the work of destruction is still
going on, although there has been some
abatement in the force of the storm.
The loss in grain and fruit Â¦ has been
very heavy, but an accurate estimate ia
out of the cuestion at this time. About
a third of the grain crop has been har
vested. Of the two-thirds that was stand
ing yesterday probably one-half has been
threshed out by the wind. The reports
from the orchards are meager, owing to
the fact that the country telephone lines
are working badly. The Bartlett pear
trees in the vicinity or Woodland are
nearly stlpped of their fruit. The prune
and peach trees have also suffered bad
ly, and a great many apricots have also
been blown off. Even the green and half
grown California walnuts almost cover
the trround under the trees. There has
been some damage to the grape crop, but
Just how much cannot yet be determined.
The wind was variable yesterday, re
maining in no quarter for any considera
ble time, but about 10 o'clock at night it
became stationary from the northwest,
soon increased in velocity and continued
with great violence all night.
WOODLAND, July 2.â The aeverest
windstorm experienced in seven year*
swept over the valley last night, dampen
in? the hoDes of the farmers and fruit
growers and destroying crops the value
of which will aggregate many thousands
of dollars.

CASH WHEAT.
WHEAT â As the European and American
harvests are beglnnins It is becoming apparent
that the crops of these two world divisions have
been overestimated. . It Is now said that the
European crop will be: much under that of last
year, with the world's stocks practically ex
hausted. The Missouri . State report indicates
less than half a crop, and Ohio, Indiana, Illi
nois, Kentucky and Tennessee are nor likely to
show much- better results. Estimates " on the
Kansas crcp are eo high â 90,000,000 bushels â
that /hey will hardly be realized. Oregon and
Washington are not expected to turn out over
70 or 80 per cent of last year's crop, and COO, 000
tons is estimated for the California crop. These
figures give the market a very steady undertone
everywhere. >
The recent rains, however, have weakened
the Chicago market a good deal, and It has lost
more on this account than it had previously
gained on dry weather.
This market was firm yesterday, but not ma
terially changed. There will be no more ses
sions of the Exchange until Monday.

seventeen were from Philadelphia, four

In these days of kerosene and" gas and
electricity one might think wax candles
had been pushed to the wall.. by their
modern rivals, but as a matter of fact
the old friends by which our grandfathers
and grandmothers made love are still
an Important factor in the lighting of
home? in this city. In the mansions of
the wealthy as well as in C"< -""-is of
the poverty-stricken, candles may' be
found to-day, though for widely different
reasons. To the poor candles are indis
pensable because science never has dis
covered a cheaper mode of lighting. And
to. the rich the flood of light emitted by a
forest of candles is a boon. because science
has not and probably never will discover
a softer and more mellow light than that
shed by the yellow flame at the end of
the ancient wax cylinder.
.In country homes where gas is < not
available and . where oil lamps must be
used the candle is found frequently j as
an agreeable and safe I substitute. The
wa:/candle of to-day, however, is a wide
ly different thing from that of olden
times. The busy bee may hum and col
lect honey and turn out all the wax she
likes; except that her product is used
for the candles in .Roman Catholic and
"high 1 ! churches, she contributes little or
nothing to those found in the market.
Ozocerite, a mineral wax, dug from the
bowels : of old dearth at 'depths varying
from 350 to ' 600 feet, 7 Is ; the substance . out
of.which most "candles now are made. In
America the "mineral: is -dug in Utah and
California/the European beds being lo
cated in Wales .' and -..-Galicla and Â¦ Rou

ozocerite appears ."in, translucent,: dark
brown, thmk films, which, upon being re
fined, I resemble beeswax closely. ,
The wax mines of Eastern Gallcia, leased
and operated by a; syndicate of "American
capitalists, ; form one of the most ' curious
fields; of industry imaginable.: They aie
located : around ; Boryslav, which is v also
:the center i of the eastern oil district :of
that part of ; Austria,' The" entire wax
fields are but- fifty acres ; in : extent,' but

HAVANA, July 2.â The treaty- covering
the naval and coaling stations and the
.treaty placing the Isle : of Pines under
Cuban sovereignty were signed to-day at
noon. ; : -\-v.V'
The two treaties, which are the last of
the six between the United States and
Cuba, were subscribed in duplicate at the
Secretary of State's office. The^signers
tvere Minister - Sauiers, Senor Garcia
Monies, Secretary of the 'Treasury, * and
ActiiiR Secretary of State in' Senor Zal
do's absence.
The Isle of '"Pirfe^'trtBity, while turning
tjver the island to the absolute sovereign
ty of Cuba, -safeguards the rights and
privileges of the American residents on
the island as though they were on Amer
ican territory. Property, judicial and edu
cational rights' are especially guaranteed,
as well as -the conveniences for reference
to the registration of property and other
building business. It is -pointed out that
the > American land holders are better off
in respect to taxation than they would
be under United States sovereignty.
There was no difficulty' or delay in
reaching ftn agreement upon the subject
of the Isle of Pines treaty, but the naval
stations lease was the subject of long and
tedious negotiations. The occupation of
the naval and coaling stations' will be
perpetual, the rental price being purely
nominal and "based on the cost of acquir
ing the stations and sites by the Cuban
Government, the United States advancing
any money necessary for the purchase of
private lands at Guantanamo and Bahia

ETTLINGER BEFORE JURY.
Of the three members of the firm- of
Eppinger & Co., Bernard \ Ettlinger re
mained the longest in the Grand Jury
room. He talked more freely than had
either of the other partners, but made no
admissions nor statements â¢; of material
fact. What he admitted was member
ship in the firm of Epplnger & Co.. and In
the Pacific Coast Warehouse Company.
He was the most zealous of the three
partners to dodge, the press reporters. :
A number of newspaper artists awaited
his departure from the Grand Jury room;
and cameras and pencils were 'engaged in
every direction in the attempt to. picture
him. He , took refuge for a time in a
room. When an artist _ found. a way v to
sketch him as he appeared > "before the
Grand Jury, making the ; ; sketch by look-
Ing in through a letter, box aperture, the
man of missing grain threw,' a newspaper
over - his head to prevent any further
tketchinr.
When the Grand Jury had! given each
As soon as Jacob Eppinger had depart
ed from tho- Grand Jury- room Herman
Eppingerwas called. He came In, walk
ing briskly and with : an appearance of
vigor. Attorney Ach was with him.
Herman Eppinger was presently closeted
with the Grand Jury in. their^ room. , He
raid ho was president of the Pacific
Coast' Warehouse Company. The ques
tions asked by District Attorney Bylng
ton covered the transactions of the ware
house company to some. extent, as well as
those of the firm of Epplnger /& Co., In
both of which Herman Â¦ Epplnger was a
great factor. No response was made to
questions leading to facts about which
the creditors of Eppinger & Co. would
like to have Information. Herman Ep
plnger was fully as non-communicative
as Jacob Epplnger had been. His time in
the jury room' was brief. "Attorney Ach
waited for. his coming and escorted him
from the Grand Jury room and Eppinger
lost no time leaving the building. He
declined to give any information to re
porters..- \
Ettlinger in the . Grand Jury ( room was
brief. The first 'witness' was Jacob Ep
pinger. He came from an upper room in
the City Hall,' walking feebly. He was
sustained by Joe Epplnger, who walked
beside him.' Jacob Eppinger gave his age,
name and residence and admitted only
that he was a member of the firm, of Ep
pinger & Co, and a director In the Pacific
Coast Warehouse Company. Beyond this
the grand jurors were, not able to gain
any admissions. He was the head of the
house of Eppinger & Co. and managed
its affairs, when the creditors, finding
that . the grain pledged to them as se
curity for cash loans 'had been -taken
away, precipitated the suspension of the
business. Less than five minutes after
Jacob Eppinger entered the grand jury
room he emerged into the anteroom.
There he was met by Attorney Ach, who
escorted' him into the hallway and saw
him safely out of the building. On the
way he answered no questions put by re
porters. - ..'... \
tation of Eppinger & Co.. and the knowl
edge that wSrheBses are testifying to
transactions . which bear : a questionable
look, failed to induce them to explain.
They were dumb on all points that con
cerned the Jurors. . .
The visit of the Eppinger* and Bernhard
Ettlinger to tfee Grand Jury room occa
sioned much popular interest. Three gray
haired menâ one of them. Jacob Eppinger.
In feeble healthâ identified prominently
with the bujrtness and commerce of San
Francisco fÂ«r many years, were cajled
upon to say how it was that hundreds of
thousands of dollars' worth of wheat and
barley, pledged to backs of San Fran-
cisco, Monterey, Colusa,' Woodland and
Fresno, had disappeared from the ware
houses where it was described, in ware
house receipts, as being stored. The aged
witnesses all stood behind their constitu
tional rights and said that, as they might
be involved in the matters into which the
Grand Jury , was looking, they declined
to answer.-
Instructed by their attorneys. Ach and
Dunne < â¢ .who accompanied them to the
City Hall, they refrained- from pleading
that their testimony might incriminate
them.' A refinement of words, suggested
to Jacob and Herman Epplnger and Bern
hard EttUnser. was the form of speech
employed by each when District Attorney
Byington tried to lead them to tell some
of the facts concerning the management
of their business. 1
MAKE NO HEADWAY. f
So. far as the testimony of either Jaeob
EppinX^r, Herman Eppinger or Bernhard
Ettlinger goes, the jurors are exactly
where they â¢ were yesterday morning.

local shortly after 5 o'clock and taken to
the City and County Hospital, where he
expired at 11 o'clock. ,
It is not. known how Collins was run
over, but he must have' been overtaken
by the train. Evidently the engineer, did
not see the unfortunate man. either be
fore or after he was hit. Collins waa
identified by papers found on his body,
which showed that he had been dis
charged from the Twelfth Infantry in
August, 1901.

District Attorney Byington is reported
to have testimony to prove that the grain
for which the :Bank: holds

between \ two and ' three months before
the receipts were issued.
Judge Murasky 1. declined 'yesterday to

SACRAMENTO, July 2.â The grain mar :
keti:i interior. California has been demor
alized ; by the . Eppinger* failure and ' not
more than one- tenth of the usual business
is Â¦ being done. ;" Grain, ' instead of , being
snipped to the "warehouses ;at : tidewater,
is Â¦ being stored ! at . interior Â¦ points and ; the
banks ; are demanding reorganization of
the entire /system^ of grain â¢ handling, fon
its i way to market, before they .will Invest
any more money In Its handling. " ... ; ,
-There is . a*: movement - on '.; foot -among
bankers" and gralnmen to j reorganize \ the
business on a sound basis and as the sea
son's business is pressing this adjustment
will not belong delayed.'.
Â¦ E. B. Cutter of Cutter & Moseley testi
fied that" at "the", order of Eppinger'& Co.
his firm had made shipments of certain
lots of grain.' F. C. Gibbons of W. A.
Costigan' & Co. testified to a similar
transaction. These are, supposed to be
lots of grain for which warehouse , re
ceipts are held by the banker-creditors.
: The last witness was W. W. Topping,
who 'was secretary of Eppinger & Co. and
who signed nearly all the warehouse re
ceipts held by the banks. Mr. Topping
developed a | defective memory concern
ing the transactions in '. which" he took
part while .. with iEppinger & Co. .
. Mrs. James Deming, wife of Superinten
ded .Deming. of the Pacific. Coast .Ware

caused the citing, of Herman and Josua
Eppinger into court for contempt, are
reported.. to have been .packed just: prior
to their hasty shipment to this city; on
the eve of the failure of EppSnger & Co.
Mrs. Deming brought her little child' to
the city and to , the Grand â¢ Jury room,
where it fell asleep, in "her arms. ' ;
Mrs. Deming would not tell anything
that would inculpate her husband. Of
the details of the business at the Ep
pinger warehouses she 'knew very little.
She\Proved of small value as a witness,
although some factscame out that may be
dovetailed with what. the grand Jurors al
ready, know and of which James Deming
is supposed to have full knowledge. Mrs.
Deming seemed to ha ve â¢% . ; bad j memory.
When she came from the jury-room she
said "I am sure that I do not" remember
anything, that I said .to. the jury." At
torney Ach and Edmund. Freund, book
keeper, were Interested . in this witness.
Both conferred with her concerning her
testimony before she went from the City
Hall. : Â¦ , Â¦ " >

In the reorganization and the combina
tion the $7,000,000 of treasury stock will be
issued to the different corporations in the
amalgamation. At no time has a propo
sition been entertained concerning the
fixing of rates. The only proposition has
been one of selling for a price satisfactory
to the promoters.
The Union Trust Company acted as
trustee in the negotiations. The entire
financing of the companies was handled
by I.' W. Hellman Sr. and John D. SprecK
els. The San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company has issued $13,000,000 of its capi
tal stock and holds $7,000,000 of the stock
in the treasury.
In the agreement it is specified that the
bond issue Is not to exceed $S,000.000. This
sum is to cover the purchase price of the
Independent Electric Light- and Power
Company, the Independent Gas and Power
Company and the Equitable Gas Company
and "betterments." The bonds are guar
anteed to run thirty' years and to bear
interest at 4^ per cent per annum.
Through John D. Spreckels Claus Spreck
els has agreed to take $5,000,000 of the
bond issue. This arrangement gives
Claus Spreckels $1,000,000 In cash. $5,000,000
in the bond issue and $160,000 in book ac
counts.
For the Independent Electric Light and
Power Conyiany and the Independent Gas
and Power Company, including book ac
counts and the outstanding contracts, the
price to be paid is $6,000,000. In other
words, the San Francisco das and Elec
tric Company pays $8,000,000 and assumes
all liabilities, which must not exceed $500,
000, and really amount to about $460,000.
There was paid yesterday to Claus
Spreckels $500,000 in gold coin. The re
mainder of the purchase price will be
pafa in three or four months, or as soon
as the bond issue can be perfected, for
which provision has been made. Six
months, is made the limit of time for the
final payment for the properties. The
agreement dates from July 2, 1903.
Neither Claus Spreckels, A. B. Spreck
els nor John D. Spreckels has acquired
any stock in either the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company, the Pacific
Gas Improvement Company or the Equit
able Gas Company.
The San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company absorbed yesterday by purchase
the Independent Electric Light and Power
Company and the Independent Gas and
Power Company. The San Francfeco Gas
and Electric Company, which is capital
ized for $20,000,000 t had previously taken in
the . Pacific Gas Improvement and the
Equitable Gas companies.

The chair named a committee, as fol

. The special meeting ' of the Union
League at 1:30 o'clock yesterday after
noon was largely attended by representa
tive members of the club. George H. Plp
py, president, announced the objects of
the' meeting.:'. He said the time h,ad ar
rived in the career of the club for serious
discussion of plans for the acquisition of
grounds and the erection of a building.
President Plppy said he was gratified to
announce that nearly all of the country
members from whom response to the cir
cular advising them of the special meet
ins had i been received were heartily in
favor of the advanced step proposed.
Mention was made of the eminence a*nd
character of- the Union League clubs of
New York, Philadelphia and other East
ern cities. It was the judgment of Colonel
Pippy that the- members of ... the Union
League of California possessed the brains,
ability and money, to place this San Fran
cisco club in line with the. leading clubs
of the East. The president asked. for an
expression of opinion from John F. Davis.
Judge Davis spoke of the present and
probable future growth of San Francisco.
California street, in the region of Mont
gomery and Sansome, was established as
the financial center of the metropolis.
The stately and durable edifices . there
erected and other structures planned gave
assurance of such adjustment. It was
equally obvious that Union Square would
be the club center of San Francisco.
Values of real estate were advancing and
would continue to advance. He believed
that the Union League had the membci
ship, enterprise and money to acquire
land and build a club house in that de
sirable quarter of the. city. . .
Henry Sonntag was confident of the
league's ability to carry..out.the proposed
enterprise. . Dan "T.. Cole, Hart North and
S.J. Hendy of this city and-W. A. Mac
kinder of StV; Helena participated in' the
discussion. . " ' " i .
The threat of Assessor Dalton of Ala
ir.eda County to seize ; a ferry-boat of the
Southern Pacific Company to-day in the
event of the corporation refusing to pay
the assessment he has .imposed on its
ferry franchises apparently is not disturb
ing. the officials of the. road on this side
of the bay; It was stated yesterday by
one of the'offlclals, 1 high in authority, that
the company does not intend to comply
with the demand of the Alameda Asses
sor and doubt was expressed by, this gen
tleman, as to whether Dalton would at
tempt to carry out his threat. The com
pany has four" ferry systems,; upon. half
of which <Dalton has imposed an assess
ment amounting to $1,050,000. Assessor
Dodge of this county has levied a similar,
assessment on the other half. In dis
cussing . the matter yesterday. Attorney
J. E. Foulds,. assistant chief counsel of
the Southern Pacific' company, said; Â¦
We won't pay. to-morrow or the following
day. In our opinion, it is presumptuous on the
part of the Assessor of Alameda County to at
tempt to assess our property before the com
pany has Â¦ had an opportunity to appear before
the mectinj? of the State Board ot Kquallza
tion, which is to be held next Monday." It Is
very plain to me that the Assessor does not
fully understand' the situation. ;Under â¢ the
laws of the State the Board of Equalization is
authorized to fix' the assessment on ' the fran
chises which include their roadways, railways
and rolling. stock. The franchise of our com
pany is assessed, as a whole and it cannot be
assessed in part, as Mr. Dalton seemingly con
tends.' . As "a matter, of fact, the j franchise of
the Southern Pacific Company begins at the
Bay of San Francisco and extends - across the
State to the boundary line, and the ferry sys
tem which is operated In connection with It is
only part of the whole system, on .which we are
accountable in the matter of assessments to the
Board of Equalization. Any lawyer 'will agree
with me on this claim, and it certainly should
be plain enough to the Assessors of San Fran
cisco and Alameda counties. However, if Mr.
Dalton attempts to carry out his announced
plan to eeize- and sell one of our steamers our
remedy will be- in the law and we will ask for
an Injunction. %

ETTLINGER BEFORE JURY.
Of the three members of the firm- of
Eppinger & Co., Bernard \ Ettlinger re
mained the longest in the Grand Jury
room. He talked more freely than had
either of the other partners, but made no
admissions nor statements â¢; of material
fact. What he admitted was member
ship in the firm of Epplnger & Co.. and In
the Pacific Coast Warehouse Company.
He was the most zealous of the three
partners to dodge, the press reporters. :
A number of newspaper artists awaited
his departure from the Grand Jury room;
and cameras and pencils were 'engaged in
every direction in the attempt to. picture
him. He , took refuge for a time in a
room. When an artist _ found. a way v to
sketch him as he appeared > "before the
Grand Jury, making the ; ; sketch by look-
Ing in through a letter, box aperture, the
man of missing grain threw,' a newspaper
over - his head to prevent any further
tketchinr.
When the Grand Jury had! given each
As soon as Jacob Eppinger had depart
ed from tho- Grand Jury- room Herman
Eppingerwas called. He came In, walk
ing briskly and with : an appearance of
vigor. Attorney Ach was with him.
Herman Eppinger was presently closeted
with the Grand Jury in. their^ room. , He
raid ho was president of the Pacific
Coast' Warehouse Company. The ques
tions asked by District Attorney Bylng
ton covered the transactions of the ware
house company to some. extent, as well as
those of the firm of Epplnger /& Co., In
both of which Herman Â¦ Epplnger was a
great factor. No response was made to
questions leading to facts about which
the creditors of Eppinger & Co. would
like to have Information. Herman Ep
plnger was fully as non-communicative
as Jacob Epplnger had been. His time in
the jury room' was brief. "Attorney Ach
waited for. his coming and escorted him
from the Grand Jury room and Eppinger
lost no time leaving the building. He
declined to give any information to re
porters..- \
Ettlinger in the . Grand Jury ( room was
brief. The first 'witness' was Jacob Ep
pinger. He came from an upper room in
the City Hall,' walking feebly. He was
sustained by Joe Epplnger, who walked
beside him.' Jacob Eppinger gave his age,
name and residence and admitted only
that he was a member of the firm, of Ep
pinger & Co, and a director In the Pacific
Coast Warehouse Company. Beyond this
the grand jurors were, not able to gain
any admissions. He was the head of the
house of Eppinger & Co. and managed
its affairs, when the creditors, finding
that . the grain pledged to them as se
curity for cash loans 'had been -taken
away, precipitated the suspension of the
business. Less than five minutes after
Jacob Eppinger entered the grand jury
room he emerged into the anteroom.
There he was met by Attorney Ach, who
escorted' him into the hallway and saw
him safely out of the building. On the
way he answered no questions put by re
porters. - ..'... \
tation of Eppinger & Co.. and the knowl
edge that wSrheBses are testifying to
transactions . which bear : a questionable
look, failed to induce them to explain.
They were dumb on all points that con
cerned the Jurors. . .
The visit of the Eppinger* and Bernhard
Ettlinger to tfee Grand Jury room occa
sioned much popular interest. Three gray
haired menâ one of them. Jacob Eppinger.
In feeble healthâ identified prominently
with the bujrtness and commerce of San
Francisco fÂ«r many years, were cajled
upon to say how it was that hundreds of
thousands of dollars' worth of wheat and
barley, pledged to backs of San Fran-
cisco, Monterey, Colusa,' Woodland and
Fresno, had disappeared from the ware
houses where it was described, in ware
house receipts, as being stored. The aged
witnesses all stood behind their constitu
tional rights and said that, as they might
be involved in the matters into which the
Grand Jury , was looking, they declined
to answer.-
Instructed by their attorneys. Ach and
Dunne < â¢ .who accompanied them to the
City Hall, they refrained- from pleading
that their testimony might incriminate
them.' A refinement of words, suggested
to Jacob and Herman Epplnger and Bern
hard EttUnser. was the form of speech
employed by each when District Attorney
Byington tried to lead them to tell some
of the facts concerning the management
of their business. 1
MAKE NO HEADWAY. f
So. far as the testimony of either Jaeob
EppinX^r, Herman Eppinger or Bernhard
Ettlinger goes, the jurors are exactly
where they â¢ were yesterday morning.

yesterday afternoon. He was picked up
in a mutilated and dying condition by the
engineer and brakeman, of the San Jose
local shortly after 5 o'clock and taken to
the City and County Hospital, where he
expired at 11 o'clock. ,
It is not. known how Collins was run
over, but he must have' been overtaken
by the train. Evidently the engineer, did
not see the unfortunate man. either be
fore or after he was hit. Collins waa
identified by papers found on his body,
which showed that he had been dis
charged from the Twelfth Infantry in

fied that" at "the", order of Eppinger'& Co.

transaction. These are, supposed to be
lots of grain for which warehouse , re
ceipts are held by the banker-creditors.
: The last witness was W. W. Topping,
who 'was secretary of Eppinger & Co. and

to their hasty shipment to this city; on
the eve of the failure of EppSnger & Co.
Mrs. Deming brought her little child' to
the city and to , the Grand â¢ Jury room,
where it fell asleep, in "her arms. ' ;
Mrs. Deming would not tell anything
that would inculpate her husband. Of
the details of the business at the Ep
pinger warehouses she 'knew very little.
She\Proved of small value as a witness,
although some factscame out that may be
dovetailed with what. the grand Jurors al
ready, know and of which James Deming
is supposed to have full knowledge. Mrs.
Deming seemed to ha ve â¢% . ; bad j memory.
When she came from the jury-room she
said "I am sure that I do not" remember
anything, that I said .to. the jury." At
torney Ach and Edmund. Freund, book
keeper, were Interested . in this witness.
Both conferred with her concerning her
testimony before she went from the City
Hall. : Â¦ , Â¦ " >

attention to other witnesses. Some i of
these were -from- Crockett and- had-, held

In the reorganization and the combina
tion the $7,000,000 of treasury stock will be
issued to the different corporations in the
amalgamation. At no time has a propo
sition been entertained concerning the
fixing of rates. The only proposition has
been one of selling for a price satisfactory
to the promoters.
The Union Trust Company acted as
trustee in the negotiations. The entire
financing of the companies was handled
by I.' W. Hellman Sr. and John D. SprecK
els. The San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company has issued $13,000,000 of its capi
tal stock and holds $7,000,000 of the stock
in the treasury.
In the agreement it is specified that the
bond issue Is not to exceed $S,000.000. This
sum is to cover the purchase price of the
Independent Electric Light- and Power
Company, the Independent Gas and Power
Company and the Equitable Gas Company
and "betterments." The bonds are guar
anteed to run thirty' years and to bear
interest at 4^ per cent per annum.
Through John D. Spreckels Claus Spreck
els has agreed to take $5,000,000 of the
bond issue. This arrangement gives
Claus Spreckels $1,000,000 In cash. $5,000,000
in the bond issue and $160,000 in book ac
counts.
For the Independent Electric Light and
Power Conyiany and the Independent Gas
and Power Company, including book ac
counts and the outstanding contracts, the
price to be paid is $6,000,000. In other
words, the San Francisco das and Elec
tric Company pays $8,000,000 and assumes
all liabilities, which must not exceed $500,
000, and really amount to about $460,000.
There was paid yesterday to Claus
Spreckels $500,000 in gold coin. The re
mainder of the purchase price will be
pafa in three or four months, or as soon
as the bond issue can be perfected, for
which provision has been made. Six
months, is made the limit of time for the
final payment for the properties. The
agreement dates from July 2, 1903.
Neither Claus Spreckels, A. B. Spreck
els nor John D. Spreckels has acquired
any stock in either the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company, the Pacific
Gas Improvement Company or the Equit
able Gas Company.
The San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company absorbed yesterday by purchase
the Independent Electric Light and Power
Company and the Independent Gas and
Power Company. The San Francfeco Gas
and Electric Company, which is capital
ized for $20,000,000 t had previously taken in
the . Pacific Gas Improvement and the
Equitable Gas companies.

The chair named a committee, as fol
lows: - . . r .-.â .Â¦..., '. f
. The special meeting ' of the Union
League at 1:30 o'clock yesterday after
noon was largely attended by representa
tive members of the club. George H. Plp
py, president, announced the objects of
the' meeting.:'. He said the time h,ad ar
rived in the career of the club for serious
discussion of plans for the acquisition of
grounds and the erection of a building.
President Plppy said he was gratified to
announce that nearly all of the country
members from whom response to the cir
cular advising them of the special meet
ins had i been received were heartily in
favor of the advanced step proposed.
Mention was made of the eminence a*nd
character of- the Union League clubs of
New York, Philadelphia and other East
ern cities. It was the judgment of Colonel
Pippy that the- members of ... the Union
League of California possessed the brains,
ability and money, to place this San Fran
cisco club in line with the. leading clubs
of the East. The president asked. for an
expression of opinion from John F. Davis.
Judge Davis spoke of the present and
probable future growth of San Francisco.
California street, in the region of Mont
gomery and Sansome, was established as
the financial center of the metropolis.
The stately and durable edifices . there
erected and other structures planned gave
assurance of such adjustment. It was
equally obvious that Union Square would
be the club center of San Francisco.
Values of real estate were advancing and
would continue to advance. He believed
that the Union League had the membci
ship, enterprise and money to acquire
land and build a club house in that de
sirable quarter of the. city. . .
Henry Sonntag was confident of the
league's ability to carry..out.the proposed
enterprise. . Dan "T.. Cole, Hart North and
S.J. Hendy of this city and-W. A. Mac
kinder of StV; Helena participated in' the
discussion. . " ' " i .
The threat of Assessor Dalton of Ala
ir.eda County to seize ; a ferry-boat of the
Southern Pacific Company to-day in the
event of the corporation refusing to pay
the assessment he has .imposed on its
ferry franchises apparently is not disturb
ing. the officials of the. road on this side
of the bay; It was stated yesterday by
one of the'offlclals, 1 high in authority, that
the company does not intend to comply
with the demand of the Alameda Asses
sor and doubt was expressed by, this gen
tleman, as to whether Dalton would at
tempt to carry out his threat. The com
pany has four" ferry systems,; upon. half
of which <Dalton has imposed an assess
ment amounting to $1,050,000. Assessor
Dodge of this county has levied a similar,
assessment on the other half. In dis
cussing . the matter yesterday. Attorney
J. E. Foulds,. assistant chief counsel of
the Southern Pacific' company, said; Â¦
We won't pay. to-morrow or the following
day. In our opinion, it is presumptuous on the
part of the Assessor of Alameda County to at
tempt to assess our property before the com
pany has Â¦ had an opportunity to appear before
the mectinj? of the State Board ot Kquallza
tion, which is to be held next Monday." It Is
very plain to me that the Assessor does not
fully understand' the situation. ;Under â¢ the
laws of the State the Board of Equalization is
authorized to fix' the assessment on ' the fran
chises which include their roadways, railways
and rolling. stock. The franchise of our com
pany is assessed, as a whole and it cannot be
assessed in part, as Mr. Dalton seemingly con
tends.' . As "a matter, of fact, the j franchise of
the Southern Pacific Company begins at the
Bay of San Francisco and extends - across the
State to the boundary line, and the ferry sys
tem which is operated In connection with It is
only part of the whole system, on .which we are
accountable in the matter of assessments to the
Board of Equalization. Any lawyer 'will agree
with me on this claim, and it certainly should
be plain enough to the Assessors of San Fran
cisco and Alameda counties. However, if Mr.
Dalton attempts to carry out his announced
plan to eeize- and sell one of our steamers our
remedy will be- in the law and we will ask for
an Injunction. %
