NEWLY ELECTED OFFICIALS TAKE
OATHS OF OFFICE.
The Commissioners in regard to Inter
national organizations say that If Parlia
ment would declare that, notwithstanding
everything in the rules of the interna
tional bodies, an agreement between an
employer and his employes would be bind
ing, the most formidable objection to
these bodies would be removed. The re
port recommended that organizations in
Canada which are controlled by the "de
cm cf a street council" at Denver should
be declared illegal.
The report shows that the Western Fed
eration, in connection with the strike at
Union, was ready to organize the Japan
ese and Chinese laborers, and that the
chief did not respect his oath as It should
have been respected in giving evidence
before the commission.
The commission's report shows that at
tempts were made to tie up the Canadian
Pacific Railway steamship service and to
ttop the supply of coal and bring about
a gigantic boycott In connection with all
products which In any way might affect
the Canadian Paclnc Railway.
DID NOT BESPECT EIS OATH.
The report says that the coal miners'
strike at Ladysmith was caused by an
intrigue whereby the Western Federation
of Mirers, in an effort to assist the
Brotherhood of Railway Employes on the
Canadian Pacific Railway, sought to tie
up the Dunsmuir mining properties on
Vancouver Island, which were at the time
supplying the Canadian Pacific Railway
with coal.
FINDINGS OF C0M2SISSI0N.
The commission which brought in these
findings to-day was composed of Chief
Justice Hunter of the Supreme Court of
British Columbia and Rev. Elliott S.
Howe, a prominent labor orator of West
ern Canada. A vast amount of evidence
has been taken during the last two
months, the object of the commission be-
Ir.g to determine the causes of labor
troubles on the coast.
Last March the United Brotherhood of
Railway Employes declared a strike
against the railway company and a thou
sand men quit work. President Estes
came up from San Francisco to conduct
the fight. The strike lasted with varying
success for a couple of months, since
â¢which time most of the men have gone
Lack to work. Before the men returned
to work evidence of the commission was
taken and to the surprise of every one the
Canadian Paclnc Railway Company pro
duced private letters of the brotherhood,
instructions from President Estes written
to Canadian officials of- the order and
other document* of the organization.
Where this Information was obtained was
a. mystery until to-day, when the Govern
ment report was issued.
VANCOUVER, B. C*. Aug. a.â That
Harold W. Poore of Winnipeg, organizer
tor the United Brotherhood of Railway
Employes for the Dominion of Canada,
traitorously sold union secrets to the Can
adian Pacific Railway the strike
against the company, is 'the principal rind
ing of a. royal commission on labor which
has been sitting recently in Vancouver.
The report cf the Governor General, made
public to-day, declares that not only did
the Canadian organizer sell information
to the railway company during the Etrike,
but while head of the fifteen hundred
members of the union organization in the
Dominion he was at the came time act
ing as one of the company's secret service
officials.
Another sensational feature of the re
port is a wholesale condemnation of the
eystem of international unionism. The
Commissioners call upon the Government
to declare illegal such unions as shall
receive controlling orders from citfes in
the United States, and specially mention
the American Labor Union, the "Western
Federation of Miners and the United
Brotherhood of Railway Employes as be

ganizations objectionable to the Govern
ment of Canada,

Erecial Dispatch to Tho Call.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 21.â A rigid inves
tigation of the whole system of the pay
ment of Chinese Indemnity to the powers
will be undertaken at once by the United
States Government.
Fearing that this country Is not getting
Its just dues, the Stats Department haa
requested the loan of two financial ex
perts from the Treasury Department Sec
retary Shaw, who himself is engaged In
a serious controversy with the Interna
tional Banking Corporation of New York,
which is the American fiscal agent la
China, has decided to place William P;
Armstrong of the office of Auditor for tha
State Department, and Joseph S. McCoy.
Treasury Department actuary, at the dis
posal of the Secretary of State.
These men will go to China within the
next few weeks and Inquire into every de
tail of the methods by which the annual
and semi-annual amortization and Inter
est installments of the Boxer indemnity
fund are paid and handled by the Inter
national Banking Commission at Shang
hai.
BITTER TIGHT . ON.
The Treasury Department and the In
ternational Banking Corporation are ar
rayed against each other on the question
of a rate of exchange of the indemnity
payment made on July 1, 1902, for a period
from July 1 to December 31. 19CL The In
ternational Banking Commission at
Shanghai, whose duty it is to receive the
indemnity Installments from the Chinese
Government, and the American member
of which is James S. Fearon, decided that
the rate of exchange should be 58*4 cents
per haikwan tael. The standard of pay
ment of the indemnity is the haikwan
tael.
The Treasury Department holds that
this was an arbitrary and unauthoritatlve
action on the part of the International
Banking Commission, especially In view
of the fact that the rate of exchange
quoted in London and in New York and
In the statement of the Treasurer of the
United States of July 1, 1902, was $0.5658155
per haikwan tael. The Treasury Depart
ment computed the indemnity payments
on the basis of the latter rate of ex
change.
SHORTAGE IN PAYMENT.
The United States bond with the Inter
national Banking Corporation provides
that this corporation shall collect the In
demnity payments and deposit them in
the sub-treasury at New York, receiving
for this service one-half of 1 per cent of
all moneys handled. The International
Banking Corporation accepted payment
on the rate of exchange fixed by the In
ternational Banking Commission and
therefore It proffered to the United States
the sum of $11,526 07 less than that which
the Treasury Department computed was
due the United States.
Secretary Shaw Is convinced that the
action of Ihe International Banking Com
mission at Shanghai Is illegal. The de
partment proposes that the International
Banking Corporation shall make good this
shortage.
Great Britain and Japan. It Is under
stood on the highest authority, are dis
satisfied with the action of the Interna
tional Banking Commission in fixing tho
rate of exchange lower than that prevail
ing in those two countries and the United
States. That they have decided on inves
tigations similar to that proposed by thÂ«
United States is practically certain.

TACOMA, Aug. 21.â Congressman Sulzer
of New York has returned from a trip to
Southeastern Alaska, where he inspected
an important mining property on Prince
of "Wales Island In which he became In
terested two years ago. He visited Ju
neau. Skagway and other towns, where
he was given a warm reception, as he Is
one of the foremost advocates in Con
gress of Alaska's need of and right to a
Territorial government. In an interview
Congressman Sulzer cays he is more than
ever impressed with the Importance of
Alaska's resources and the Justice of the
claim of her people for local self-govern
ment. He is determined therefore to ad
vance in every possible way legislation
in Alaska's behalf during the coming ses
sion of Congress. He points out that dur
ing the last fiscal year the revenues of
the Alaskan government exceeded the ex
penditures by nearly $300,000, proving that
Alaska's present " population can afford
the expenses of a Territorial government
if they desire. In his opinion the rapid
development of Alaska's Industries can
be best accomplished by placing the ad
ministration of her public affairs in the
hands of her own people, who thoroughly
understand the country's needs.

OAKLAND, Aug. 21.â Ten thousand
veterans of the Grand Army of
the Republic, with their wives,
children and friends, were the
Kuests to-day of Alameda Coun
ty. The throngs of visitors rendezvoused
in Oakland, but after luncheon ppr-.'ad
out over the bay cities and suburban
towns as far as Haywards. They feasted
the inner man on luscious fruits and the
other senses were regaled with the mag
nificent weather, the beautiful scenery,
the parks and the drives, the splendid
vlFtas of ocean, bay and lake from the
hills, and, to the thousands of Eastern
strangers wiihin the county's gates, the
miles of orchards and rich farms were
loadstones of powerful attraction.
Ideal w?s the day from morning dew to

worded his way back to San Francisco,
a picture of contentment, even if a bit
tired for his day among the east side
cities.
The programme for the reception was
carried through perfectly, except that
some of the belated ones suffered a lit
tle inattention because the throng of visit
ors simply overwhelmed the reception

veterans, while all of the county cities

Dille.
An English poet has immortalized th> charge
at liaSak'avL. That was a great charge, but
it was a mistake. It was a blunder. They, wmt
to death and many rode to Immortality. But
can we match it? Come with me to Chancel
lorsvllle and I'll show you wh*Â»nr to save the
day Major Kiernan. a gallant officer, rode to
death In the face of 50<x> men commanded by
Stonewall Jackson. Contrast the charge on the
bridge at Antictam to the charge at th? bridge
of Lndi under NaDoleon and where will the
greatest slnry lie? Hut Napoleon held the
bridge at LodJ for personal aggrandizement;
the Union force to preserve the Union. '
GALLANT MAJOR KIERNAN.
And I want to say to the people- of Califor
nia, though It might hurt your feelings, that
you haven't surprised us a bit this time. We
know you now, you see. I want to say to tha
young men who have read and heard about us
this week that you must not think we are
spreading the eagle's wings too wide or making
him screech too loud. The men who fought ana
preserved this Union should be permitted to
Â¦peak of their achievements and make much
of them. Their country owes a vast debt of
gratitude to them. It Is not the cost of thÂ»
war and the pensions that people should grum
ble over. The real cost of the war was in the
homes that were destroyed before they wera
built. In the sacrifice of life and limb. In the
broken families. How often did the.se thlnns
happen? How often after the war was the
bridal dre*Â» laid away because the bridegroom
lay In a soldier's grave?
Your president referred most beautifully and
tenderly to the women of the war and spoko
of what they had to endure. I don't aupposo
there la any of us that doesn't know what thÂ©
women suffered, but their sufferings dM n>>t
all com* when the war went on â it was after
ward, when the husband and sons anil brothers
were killed and maimed, that they were dealt
the hardest blows. I have my own opinions
about women, and I want to Â»ay that I don't
believe and never will that God created womaa
to make her the subsUMAry attachment to man.
I didn't understand that this Institution was
co-educatlonal ; so I want to say to you younff
mea that you will never be abla to fully ma
triculate unless your education Is Increased by
association with young women â till you meet
one that will put her hand in yours and help
you to get a thorough education. Some of us
veterans were la California at the encampment
of 1886. I remember that waÂ» my twenty
ninth encampment, and I never will forget tha
hospitality ' the people showed us at that time.
I guess a good many more must have remem
bered it. for at the last encampment when tha
next meeting- place was decided the vote wÂ»3
almost unanimous.
ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE WAE.
WELCOMED BY PBESTDEfTT.
President "Wheeler, on behalf of the uni
versity, said:
Welcome, welcome to all the veterans. And
Mr. Rlckard. we are clad to welcome you here,
too. Town and' eown, one and both, extend
hands to welcome t*ie vet?rana of the Civil
War. The university stands for the unity of
the State and the nation, for truth and order
and straightforwardness. We expect our stu
dents to be intelligent and at the same tim*
loyal, and these 'university exercises are de
signed for us . to consecrate ourselves to the
State and nation in the name of these men
who fought and feared not.
These boys and youne men slttin? here to
day can know nothing of these Civil War
times. But it was part of my education to sea
srmethinsr of them. I remember being lifted
on the shoulders of fonÂ» kmdly person when
I vai a child In my Massachusetts home look
ing far down a long line of men, armed ami
accoutered, as they started toward the train
that was to take them to the front. I saw
them take up thelf guns, I heard their tramp,
tramp. I saw them disappear. I saw their
return. And month after month I >aw those
grim boxes come bark and heard the mournful
music as tney were being carried 'to the grave.
Those were days when war was a part of
religion. We were right and we knew we were
light. And the men who went to the front
did a great dee*. . And I want you boya hero
to DÂ«J wanned by the oatrinttaxn ami self â¢Â«<:
riflce of those men, to show your patriotism
and to go to the sacrifice as these men did.
TANTTEB/S CHEEBIUG WORDS.
President "Wheeler introduced Corporal
Tanner as the speaker of the day. Cor
poral Tanner, as he walked to his place
at the speaker's desk, presented a living
example of patriotism and self-sacrifice.
He walked with the aid of cratchesâ
crutches that he has used for forty yeara
âfor his legs were shot off by a cannon
ball at the battle of Bull Run. He said
in part;
This is one of the sweetest sights I have
gazed on for a long. Ions time. When your
reception committee searched me out and re
quested me to come here it was a hurried In
terview and I didn't grasp the significance nt
the occasion. But I understood that it wou!d
be a great pleasure to talk to the students of
the University of California and tell them
something about the great struggle, though, I
thought they must know as much about it as
we.
The patriotic exercises were held in
Harmon Gymnasium at 4 o'clock. la
this big hall an Immense crowd filled
every chair and a good part of the stand
ing space. The university "rooters" werÂ£
there with their boiler-factory lungs, ut
tering their college yells and singing their
familiar songs.
President "Wheeler, Corporal Tanner,
Thomas Rlckard, Dr. E. R. Dille, flanked
by others of the reception committees and
the veteran body, sat upon the platform.
The hall was simply decorated .with bas
kets of flowers and stringers of greens.
Just back of the chairman's seat waved
an American flag borne by a cadet cap

PROFESSOR PUTNAM
COMES TO BERKELEY
Mr. Commander an'l Comrades. I would be
glad to express precisely the emotions which
arise in me in consequence of Buch a cordial
greeting Such warmth, from such a body I
appreciate more than nny other compliment
which I could possibly receive, and such
warmth overwhelms, for the moment, my ca
pacity for concentration and co-ordination of
thought. You will therefore have to accept in
a spirit of generosity whatever I may be able
to say in return for thlÂ« great privilege in this
inspiring presence. However, in the midst of
such surroundings one can never . be entirely
at a loss for something to eay, as no other
relation of friendship is so strong, so lasting.
as that which exists among American soldiers
and sailors. This great confidence, this mu
tual appreciation, does not arise entirely from
the fact that we have shared together tho
perils of fields and waves; it arises from the
etill stronger reach that it is from the Justice
of the cause rathfcr than from the successes
of our battles than American soldiers and sail
ors expect the honor of a triumph from their
fellow men. In thla connection I want to re
peat a remark that I have made on many oc
casions before less sympathetic audiences; the
remark is pregnant for the future as It has
been true In the pastâ that American guns
have never been fired In war without contrib
uting materially and substantially to the wel
fare and hopes of mankind.
This great republic has had a classical past
and is enjoying an unexampled present and is
undoubtedly to have a heroic future. There
fore, my comrades, in leaving thiÂ« grand en
cunjpment let us all renew our devotions to
MACARTHUR IS CHEERED.

splendid soldier, exemplary commander
and patriotic citizen. General Nelson A.
Miles, upon his attainment of a distin
guished and honorable retlremf-nt after a
matchless record as a soldier of over
forty-two years' service, without Just
criticism of his official conduct, which be
gan as a lieutenant In the Twenty-second
Massachusetts Infantry, progressing by
the brightest grade' of heroic patriotism
from Manassas to Appomattox, during the
greatest of all civil wars from 1S61 to 1S65,

many thousands, who- by. Individual acts of

the flag, the flag which in our hand? expanded
h> such ample scope that under its beneficent
folds Injustice and oppression are Impossible;
the flag which la the visible symbol of daily
Inspirations of the American people; the flag
which is the one focus in which we ail unite
In reverential devotion.
We differ In politic?, we differ In religion,
we enter into violent disputes in respect to
the true meaning of the constitution; we even
challenge some of the provisions of that sacred
instrument; we inject largely our selfish de
sires and cupidity into all the transactions of
our daily lives, but from the sanctified folus
of the flag, the collective intelligence of tha
nation rises superior to any of Its parts and
thereby Insures the perpetuity of the republic.
Again I thank you for this magnificent re
ception.

Comrades of the Thirty-seventh National En
campment: It Is useless for me to say that I
appreciate the honor you have conferred upon
me; but I do wish to eay that I appreciate the
fact that In selecting me you have evidenced
your desire to honor the Department of Cali
fornia. When those who know me bept unani
mously Indorse me for this position, those that
have been with me in the work for thlrty-slx
years in California, I felt sure almost that
the acquaintanceship that I have in nearly all
of the departments that there could be but one
result. 1 was not quite sure, for you cannot
tell what may happen. I fully appreciate that
you have elected me to a very high office, but
one with very little responsibility attached to
It, and for that reason I propose to take a<i
lantage of this position and say but a very
few words, and end by.promjsing that I will
do all In the future as I have done in the
past that lies In my power to maintain the
principles of the Grand Army of the Repub

His Soldierly Qualities Adopted. -
THE rooms of the California Com
mandery of the Loyal Legion at
the Occidental Hotel were
thronged yesterday with the vis
iting companions of the Loyal Legion and
their comrades of the Grand Army of the
Republic. The arrangements were perfect
in every detail.
The spacious rooms were profusely
decked with the nation's colors, and a
wealth of floral decorations added to the
general beauty of the apartments.
Rich viands were dispensed with lavish
hand and the hospitality for which the
legion Is noted was emphasized on this
occasion In the most superlative degree.
Among the hosts who were looking after
the welfare of their guests were Colonel
Smedberg. the recorder of the California
Comm.indery; Admfral O. W. Farenholt,
IT. S. N.; Captain Whiting, U. S. N.; Ma

THROWN FROM A BUGGY
AND SERIOUSLY INJURED
David Wolfe, Stenographer at City
and County Hospital, Meets
With Painful Accident.
David Wolfe, stenographer and book
keeper at the City and County Hospital,
was thrown from a buggy at Eighth and
Howard streets yesterday afternoon and
seriously Injured.
Wolfe was In a buggy that was being
driven by John O'Brien, commissary of
the hospital.- Just below Mission street
the team struck a rut and the horse, a
spirited one, started suddenly on a run.
O'Brien was thrown out of the busgy,
but landed on his feet and was not hurt.
The lines had dropped over the dashboard
and Wolfe could not get control of the
frightened horse. Near the corner of
Howard street the buggy collided with a
track and Wolfe was thrown with great
violence to the street. â¢
The City Hall patrol wagon was passing
and Wolfe was taken in it to the Central
Emergency Hospital.
An examination by Drs. Bunnell and
Weyer showed that Wolfe had sustained
a severe laceration of the scalp, a serious
fracture of the right elbow and that his
left arm was broken near the wrist.
As the result of a daring robbery la
Chinatown last evening Jue Lem, Tee
Gin and four other highbinders are in the
City Prison. The vigilance and ability
displayed by Corporal Sylvester and
posse and Detective McMahon resulted in
the recovery of the plunder and the ar
rest of six Chinamen, alleged to be the
most desperate crooks in the Chinese
quarter.
Shortly after 7 o'clock Jue Lem, accom
panied by Yee Gin. entered the jewelry
store of Gin HI & Co. at 811 Dupont
street and asked to be shpwn a gold
bracelet. Several bracelets were passed
out for their Inspection, when suddenly
Lem selected one of the most valuable
and handed It to his pal. â¢ Gin escaped and
ran into a doorway' on Dupont street. Tha
clerks seized Jue Lem and the China
town squad was summoned. Upon the ar
rival of the officers a search was made of
the neighborhood, but no trace of tho
fugitive could be found. Lem was taken
to the Hall of Justice and locked up in the
tanks.
About one hour afterward Yee Gin -was
arrested in Cum Cook aliey and when
searched the bracelet was found in hia
pocket. He denied all knowledge of the
theft and professed Ignorance as to hovr
the property came Into his possession.
Acting upon information Detective Mc-
Mahon. in company with several mem
bers of the Chinatown squad, raided a
room in a Jackson-street rooming-house
and took Into custody four Chinese found
there. A search of the apartment brought
to light a 44-callber Colt's revolver, two
Jimmies and several pawn tickets. All of
those arrested are members of the Hop
Sine Tong and it Is believed that they
were concerned in the attempted robbery
of another jewelry store on Dupont
street, near Washington, about one
month ago, when several shots were fired
at the fleeing criminals.
The members of Gin HI & Co. positively
identified Jue Lem and Yee Gin as the
culprits and the bracelet as their prop
erty. The police are elated over the cap
ture and believe that a well organized
gang of crooks has been broken up. The
pawn tickets found In the room on Jack
son street call for several pieces of valu
able jewelry and may lead to the fasten
ing of other crimes on the men in cus
stody.
THE visiting newspaper men were
entertained last night at the
Press Club by the local organl-
zatlon of newspaper writers and
the press committee of the G. A. R. gen
eral committee.
The entertainment was in the nature of
a ladles' smoker. Captain W..L. Barnes
was sire of the jinks and presided in a
most felicitous manner. The officers of
the club were represented by James A.
Carey, Alpheus DIxon, K. C. Lefnngwell.
W. C. Hollaway and L. E. Stcver, assist
ed by Hugh M. Burke, Colonel Charles L.
Pierce and Louis Levy of the G. A. R.
press committee, who extended a hospita
ble welcome to the 400 visitors.
The decorations .were superb.. Flags and
bunting decked the .walls, while Superin
tendent McLaren sent a whole wagon
load of beautiful roses from Golden Gate
Park.
The programme was novel, as well as
interesting, and passed off without a
hitch. Applause was frequent and gen
erous.
Among the numbers were the Press
Club Glee; Newel Vincen, the tenor of
Grace Church; Kathleen Parlow, 12 years
of age, a phenomenal violinist: Carl Rei
ter, resident manager of the Orpheum at

ment of California and Nevada, received
comrades and friends at 102 OTarrell
street throughout yesterday. The mem
bers of the post dispensed hospitality
without limit. There were vocal and In
strumental selections, and refreshments
from early morning until night. The
aim of the gallant members of Meade
Post, as with the members of other of
the local posts of the Grand Army of the

itors had ail the comfort that could be
enjoyed at a private club. Their efforts
have been rewarded by the hearty re
sponse of the comrades who flocked to
the quarters every day since the opening
of the encampment.
The Knickerbocker Quartet rendered
vocal numbers selected from the patriotic
musical folio, and also the latest quaint
and humorous songs.
A recitation splendidly delivered by
Miss II. J. Hassenmuller, telling a story
of war, was heartily received, and songs
were rendered by Miss Helen Colburn
Heath and F. "W7 Jacobs. Miss Lillian
Qulnn recited, and Miss Nellie B. Waters
gave a delightful selection of good old
American melodies on the bells. MIs3
Julia Rapier Tharp's piano solo was a
successful feature of the afternoon pro
gramme, which finished with stereoptlcon
views of the Pacific Coast.
The George H. Thomas Post entertain

It is generally conceded that Harrison
would make an ideal man for the place.
As Sheriff of Marin County he made an
exceptionally, able official ana gained a
large knowledge of what is necessary tin
the handling of desperate . criminals. He
is conceded to be courageous, â¢ cool and of
excellent judgment, and has a splendid
record for probity.' At present he Is hold
ing* a responsible position at San Queritln
prison.
- The logic of political reasoning points
Btrongly to a confirmation of these predic
tions. In the first place, he is a Demo
crat and as such will be acceptable to a
majority of the Board of Pris6n Directors.
It Is an unwritten law that one of the
Wardens of the State penitentiaries shall
be a Republican and tne other a Demo
crat- The appointment of Warden Tomp
kins to San Quentin precludes the selec
tion of one of similar political faith for
the Folsom position. Three of the pres
ent board of directorsâ James H. Wllklns,
R. M. Fitzgerald and Don Rayâ are Dem
ocrats, and all are saW to be friendly to
Harrison's appointment.
Director Wilkins is a strong friend and
supporter of the Marin County ex-sherlft.
He has been behind him in every political
fight Harrison has made, and to him is
attributed the election of Harrison to the
office of Sheriff. Fitzgerald was sponsor
for Wilkinson, the present Warden, and
Wllklns voted with his- fellow director.
As a matter of reciprocity, Fitzgerald is
now supporting Harrison, and Don Ray
is also said tÂ£ be favorably inclined
toward the massive man from Marin
County.
Interest In State politics at present
centers In the question as to who will be
the next Warden of Folsom penitentiary.
It is conceded that Warden Wilkinson has
practically reached the limit of his tenure
in office. The Prison Directors will meet
to-day to begin an investigation into the
escape of thirteen prisoners a few weeks
ago, and It Is a foregone conclusion that
their inquiry will result ift the resigna
tion of the present Warden.
The name most prominently mentioned
in connection with the expected appoint
ment Is that of Henry Harrison. ex-
Bheriff of Marin County. Those in touch
with the sentiments of the Prison Di
rectors claim that his success Is assured
and confidently predict that before De
cember 1 he will be occupying the posi
tion.

B Union Square Hall, first for the
"Â¦ ma* purpose of installing their newly
elected officers,- and second,- to
hold a social at the termination of a busi
ness meeting. .' :
The installation was dignified and im
pressive. It was about 9 o'clock when
Mrs. II. Anna Hall read the ritual, and
the officers-elect were conducted to the
center of the hall, from which position
they, In turn, answered the questions pro
pounded by the installing officer.
"When each officer-elect had made dec
laration to obey the regulations of the
organization and had made known that
she was willing to accept the responsibil
ity of the position, the elect was con
ducted to the platform, where she took
her place In line with the national pres
ident.
The officers installed were:

Miss Ruth Hall, Wheeling, W. Va., and Mrs.
Mary T. Hager. Illinois.
Each of the new officers received hearty
congratulations from friends and then the
social programme of the evening began.
Music was a feature of the entertain
ment and several vocalists rendered songs
so admirably that they were recalled.
Much was said by members of the dis
tinguished order touching the reception
accorded them here. All were profuse in
paying the committees of San Francisco
praise for their untiring efforts \o insure
to the visitors every possible comfort,
and more that the arrangements had
been followed without accident, It was
admitted, proved the executive ability
and care . with which the whole pro
gramme had been devised and carried
out.

were closed yesterday afternoon
with a bit of pleasant ceremony, which
few connected with that department had
anticipated. A few minutes before 5
o'clock General Black, the new com
mander in chief of the organization, who
had been engaged in consultation with
the newly appointed members of his staff,
suddenly rose from his seat at a table
and. turning to his associates, remarked:
"Gentlemen, the labors of the Thirty
seventh Annual Encampment having prac
tically closed with the adjournment of to
day's meeting of delegates, It would prob
ably bo the proper thing to regard these
quarters as also closed. Before taking
our departure, however, I would like the
privilege of saying a few words to our
comrades who have acted as a guard at
headquarters during the week, which is
rapidly drawing to a close," and, acting on
his own suggestion, General Black pro
ceeded to the outer room, where the
guard, in response to the order of its offi
cer of the day, "fell in" and stood at at
tention. As General Black approached,
arms were brought to a "present," as is
the military custom, but by a- signal of
his hand the commander in chief waived
formalities and, turning to' the proud old
soldiers, addressed a few remarks to
them, thanking them for their courtesy,
recalling their past loyalty to the country
and wishing them long life and good
cheer. Nor did he stop there. Stepping
up to the line, he passed along it, shak-'
Ing each veteran by the hand and receiv
ing with an air of comradeship their sin
cerely expressed friendship.
After the adjournment of the convention
yesterday General Black made public the
appointment of the principal officers of
his staff, who will be as follows:
Adjutant Generalâ C. A. Partridge of
Illinois.

the Big Trees, a special excur
sion having been arranged for their con
venience by the Southern Pacific Com
pany. A large number of veterans trav
eled over the lines of the California
Northwestern to points aa far as Santa
Rosa, where they were warmly welcomed,
and not a few patronized the North Shore
route, especially the new electric branch
running to Mill Valley. Some also Jour
neyed up to the top of Mount Tamalpais,
but the biggest travel was to Oakland.
In fact, It was bo large that the Southern
Pacific Company's officials had their
hands full handling the crowds that
crossed the bay on the ferries during the
forenoon and early in the afternoon. It
was a bigger crowd than the company
had expected, and certainly more than
the people of Oakland had looked for.
To-day the veterans and their friends
are invited to San Jose, where elaborate
arrangements have been made for their
reception. The people of the pretty little
city have done a great deal of booming
for the event, and the railroad company
has made extra preparations for traffic,
for it Is expected that an unusually large
crowd will make the trip.
Notwithstanding that thousands of the
veterans absented themselves from the
city yesterday, a goodly number remained
behind and continued to give the city a
convention appearance by their presence
on the streets and about the hotels. The
different California headquarters contin
ued to keep open house, and the Eastern
visitors repeated the pleasant experiences
of the previous days of the week in mak
ing a call and enjoying the California
hospitality extended to them. At the
headquarters of the Sacramento .Valley
Veterans' Brigade, in the Lick House,
there was a constant throng of visitors
throughout the day. They called empty
handed and left with a box of choice fruit
and a small bottle of native wine, a gift
that all visitors have received and appre
ciated. The fact that the encampment
is practically over did not in any way di
minish the hospitality of the Sacramento
Valley representatives yesterday. If any
thing they were even more generous, go
ing even so far as to send large boxes of
selected fruit and wine around to the va
rious headquarters of the numerous East
ern delegations, accompanied with the
suggestion that the juicy product of the
Btate would be forthcoming as long as
the visitors signified their willingness to
consume It. As an inducement for out
siders to enter the headquarters and par
take of the fruit and wine the Sacramen
to Valley people had a band stationed at
the entrance of the Lick House during
the afternoon playing almost continu
ously. â¢
The Fresno delegation entertained in a
similar manner at its headquarters In
Pioneer Hall.

effect that a man who buys railroad tickets

the emphatic language of Count Gurowakl. "a

the time. I thought It evidenced great prac

famous Commissioner of Pensions to

He Â«'aÂ« unable to do so, but he epoke
from where he stood, and said in part:
What do we think of California, we your

hangs upon our nation's breast. We think

CALIFORNIA'S FUTUBE.
We. your vUltore, were boys in 1861, Gen
eral Bhafter. when we first learned to love
California. The pioneer, the argonaut, the man
with the pick on his shoulder had come and
rnentd up some of the wonderful wealth of your
Ptate, but as yet California was to the men
of th* far East only a Utopia and a dream.
Then came our mtghty war. Where would
California be? Was It to be what we had
hoped â a source of income and prosperity?
Would fhe prove false to the destinies
of the republic, or would fhe cast her lot with
us? And to these questions in the course of
eighteen months came a wonderful answer.
My comrades, let me ask you to turn back
to those times, when all the vast resources
of the Government seemed locked and para
lyzed. Our boys were dying In the hospitals,
with no attention or car* to be given to them
for the reason that our Government was strur
pilng fc-r Its life and could not stop and do
the kindly and tender things that universal
charity desired. In the hour of Its extrem
ity, in this month of August. Just forty-two
years ego, a lightning dispatch was carried
to the President of the United States and we
wrre told that California rrom the depths of
her mines and the richness of her placers gave
$100,000 tn gold that her soldiers might be
helped. (Great applause.) And from that time
on, until the close of thÂ« war. we knew that
California was true to the mighty banner of
UÂ»e free.
Comrades and Fellow Citiiene: It is my high
privilege and honor on behalf of the Grand
Amy of the Republic to re?j*md to the words
of welcome that have just beÂ«n pp<jken by our
gallant ccmrade and friend and rpokesman of

During the enthusiasm Commander in

fully five minutes before the cheering
ceased. His voice then rang out over the
gathering and his speech was loudly ap

the cheer* that fined trie Pavilion
drowned the music.
Five thousand chairs were provided for
the veterans, and none were vacant. The
comrades enjoyed the repast and the
evening was enjoyable throughout. AH
praised California'* hospitality.
Major General Shafter was the chair
man of the big gathering. His heart was
gladdened by the outburst of enthusiasm
that greeted him when he arose to make
the opening address. It was some time
before he ccuid begin, and after the out
burst he spoke in part as follows:
It is with great pleasure that I rise to voice
the welcome of the comrades of the Paclfle
to the visiting comrades of the Grand Army

The band then struck up "America"
and all In the hall arose and mingled
their voices with the sweet strains. At its
conclusion the band played one "of Sousa's
stirring marches and the veterans filed
out. Every man carried with him his tin
cup and plate as a souvenir of the occa
sion. The success of the affair was due
to the following committee:
It Is a labor of love for me to respond to the
sentiment of the American soldier as he was
and as he Is. I have summered and wintered
with him, in victory and defeat in sunshine
and in *tÂ»rm. in war and in peace. In brief,
we have drunk from the same canteen. I have
seen him natty and neat on the. parade, fit
for comparison with Europe's best troop*. (Ap
plause ) I have seen him In battle, when he
had ail the oarage passions of man aroused;
I have seen him tender and ready to share his
last drop with his enemy. I have seen him In
the deserts of Arizona. I have seen him In the
storms of Montana. I have seen him In the
Philippine*: on the road to Peking. I have
â¢eÂ«n him tn camp and on the march. Joyous
and cheerfully submitting kindly to disci
pline, but at all times and under all circum
stances he has been a credit to himself and to
noble American manhood. (Applause.)
RECALLS GREAT EVENTS.
General Stewart then glanced in the gal
lery where the pictures of Sheridan,
Mea'de. Thomas, Garfleld, McPherson,
Hooker and other famous generals of the
war were hung, and with the skill of the
orator he pictured them in the battles
they were engaged in. He spoke at great
length and was frequently interrupted
with applause.
General Woodruff followed and delivered
a splendid eulogy on the American sol
dier. The general is a small man, but
possesses a big voice and his fame as an
orator was evidently well known, as he
wan accorded the closest attention. He
said: *v
General MaeArth-ur and ex-Governor
Bulkeley of Connecticut were called for,
but they were absent. General Thomas
J. Stewart, the ex-commander of the
Grand Army of the Republic, was ac
corded an ovation when he mounted a
chair to address his comrades. In part
he spoke as follows:
I am a little ahead of time owing to the
absence of two of the sneakers v/bo were to
precede me. I have been asked to ?ay a word
to the sentiment, "The Passing: of thÂ» Granl
Army of the Republic." As applied to myself,
that seems to be particularly appropriate. I
am going up and out. But the sentiment as
signed takeÂ» me. aa it must take you, back
over the lapse of the mighty years of this great
republic, back to the stirring years of 01. when
there hovered over this nation and this people
dark and heavy cloud*, and upon our memory
to-nt^ht is written the memorable picture of
that time. We can bear again the call made
by the great Lincoln and all the highways and
byways of this great and wonderful country
of ours were filled with patriots coming with
hurrying feet and seeking the campflre of lib
erty. And to-night we. can follow the boys and
the men of that time ever the 2000 battlefields.
To-day this Grand Army of the Republic is
like a mighty forest in which all the great
oakÂ« have been cut down, and as I look at
these people to-night my mind wanders back
to the Rebellion.

I shall take home to that youn? stalwart
State of Minnesota rrost happy recollections
of this, my first visit to this State, and you
can reÂ»t assured that by and by. an we begin
to feel the growth of years, some of uÂ» will
ccme out to make out homes among you. but
you need not look for me for some twenty-nye
or thirty yean. (Laughter.) I now solemnly
pledge myself to answer the rollcall at the next
national encampment to be held In this city

General Ell Torrance was the next
speaker. He created a deal of merriment
at the outset of his address by saying
that if there were as many present on the
day of judgment as he saw before him,
it would be eminently successful. He re
pressed the cries of those who yelled
"Louder" by telling the following story:
Not Ions azo a friend of mine was called
upon to open a meeting like this with prayer.
He proce<tlrd to do so and in a low voice. He
had not rot far when some one yelled Loud

plied: "I am not addressing you, sir." (Ap

down from Nevada to-day for the pur

over the failure of the man hunters to
make a catch and he deemed it time
that something was doing. He felt him
self fully equal'to the task of rounding
up at least three of the convicts and he
visited Sacramento for the purpose of
equipping himself with the proper arma
ment Bill purchased a $50 rifle, Â£ belt'
filled with cartridges and two revolvers,
and started forth.
It happened, however, that "Arizona
Bill" had a wide acquaintance in local
sporting circles and It was not long be
fore he was in the condition described as
"four-thirds" full. Bill looked and felt
warlike when he finally headed for the
American River bridge district. He
paused at intervals-, to sight his rifle at
an imaginary convict behind a tree and
struck terror to the housewives along his
route. Doors were double barred, chil
dren ran fcr shelter and word was sent
to the police that an escape convict, fully
armed, had just entered a corner saVoon.

ried to the Bcene. "Arizona Bill" was

Russia's move in sending warships to
Turkish waters has caused surprise in
diplomatic circles and disapproval, and
regret in Government quarters. The feel-
Ing expressed here is that It can only
do harm in inclining the insurgents, who
are ignorant of the complications of . Eu
ropean politics, to the belief that Russia
is supporting their cause against the
Turks. It is also conjectured that,.Rus
sia having apparently acted without first
consulting Austria, some rifts have oc
curred in the concert of the powers.
Whatever may be the explanation the
feeling here is that Russia's movement
At Kratovo half of the Turkish garrison
has deserted, the men saying that they
had enough to do at home. The Turkish
authorities have mobilized their whole
forces in Macedonia, numbering 18,000
men. A large body of Asiatic troops is
ready to move. Twenty-four regiments
are only awaiting their marching orders.
The Macedonian revolutionary organi
zations are levying heavy assessments on
the rich Macedonians resident in Bul
garia. They J *have drawn" up a complete
list of names, with the amounts to be
demanded against each.
The Sofia Dnevjik declares that all the
Turkish vilayets in Macedonia will be in
full lcvolt August 28 and that the revo
lution isfeprcadlng from Salonlca into the
districts toward Seres. Several new
bands have appeared in the district of
Voden, southeast from Monastir. ,A gen
eral panic prevails in the vilayet of Us
kub, where the Inhabitants ) are hiding
their property. The Turkish and Chris
tian inhabitants at Kumanovo have
agreed to mutually support each other in
the event of an attack either by Insurgent
bands or Turkish soldiers.
REVOLT IS SPREADING.
The insurgents completely burned Vasil
iko and also twelve villages In the neigh
borhood. The Bulgarian officials arrest
ed the insurgents who brought the Turk
ish officials at Vasiliko to the Bulgarian
frontier. Severe fighting Is reported to
be proceeding near Gehgele, with heavy
losses on both sides.
The peculiar danger of the latest out
break lies In Its proximity to the Bulga
rian frontier, thus .creating a Bituation
long foreseen and dreaded by the Sofia
Government. The Turks are now certain
to send a considerable force to thl3 terri
tory to suppress the outbreak, which will
necessitate the strengthening of the Bul
garian troops along the frontier. With
the two armies close to each other under
the present strained relations the situa
tion becomes extremely desperate. The
Bulgarian Government Is taking every
possible step to puevent a calamity, but
officials express the greatest concern.
In addition to the danger of a collision
between the military forces there is the
smaller one of populaT excitement get
ting beyond control and forcing the Gov
ernment to adopt a belligerent attitude.
Meanwhile the community remains quiet,
even the Macedonian' part of the popula
tion showing no popular anxiety and en
thusiasm.
The Insurgents ' burned the villages
around Vasiliko and attacked a Turkish
military post at the monastery of Elijah,
south of Tirnovo. The eastern part of
the Adrianople vflayet is a mountainous
region and the villages are few and scat
tered. The strength of the insurgents is
unknown. It is thought that the out
break Is not an organized movement, but
is intended as a divei^lon to draw the
Turkish troops from the other districts.
PERIL OF BULGARIA.
The most alarming news relates to an
outbreak covering a considerable area In
the eastern part of the Adrianople vil
ayet, where the Insurgents have captured
the town of Vasiliko. They took the
chief Turkish officials prisoners j and
brought them to the Bulgarian frontier,
where they liberated them. The Turkish
officials, fearing to return to Vasiliko,
sought refuge with the Bulgarian author
ities, who sent them to a hotel in Burgas,
where they are at liberty to remain or de
part.

THEIR MONETARY EEPOET
The conclusion is drawn that the in
creased growth of the East and tne de
creased â¢ growth of the West may be con
nected with a probable decline in the cur
rent of westward migration. The rate3 of
increase In the North and South during
the last twenty years were practically the
same. But In the character of this growth
the two regions differ widely, there be
ing a relatively uniform growth over the
whole South, equalized by a balance In
the North between a lower rateÂ«pf rural
growth and a higher rate of urban
growth.
Extensive but sparsely settled areas in
the western parts of Kansas, Nebraska
and South Dakota show a decline of pop
ulation in the last ten years, a fact which
It is said may be connected with the in
"crease of population in many agricultural
countes of Iowa, Illinois and adjoining
States, 1890 to 1900.
The most noteworthy result of the en
tire discussion, it Is said. Is the cumula
tive evidence of the rapid approach to
equality In the rates of increase of vari
ous parts of the United States. This- ap
pears whether North be compared with
South. East with West, or city with coun
try. " '
The rates of increase on the two sides
of the Northern Atlantic differ much less
than they did a generation ago. Among
the five main divisions of continental
Unfjed States the highest rate of increase
is found in the Western division and the
lowest In the North Central. Among the
eleven minor divisions the highest rate of
growth is found in the Rocky Mountain
group of States, closely followed by the
Western South Central; the lowest in
the Northern South Atlantic, closely fol
lowed by the Western North Central.
In the decade 1S90 to 1900, for the first
time in our national history, the Southern
States Increased faster than the North
ern. East Of the Mississippi River, how
ever, the Northern States as a group
have grown in the past ten years some
what more rapidly than the Southern, but
west of that river the Southern States
have Increased almost two aud one-half
times as rapidly as the Northern, and it
is this fact which makes the growth of
the South as a whole exceed that of the
North. In the North Atlantic division
the rate cf Increase has risen steadily
since the Civil War, a notable contrast
to the trend in the country as a whole.
The region west of the Mississippi River
is still Increasing faster than east o* It.
but the difference between the rates of
growth in the two regions. ISiX) to 1900,
was little more than one-fifth cf what it
was from 1SS0 to 1S90. The region west
of the Mississippi increased more rapidly
from 1S00 to 1900 than from 1SS0 to 1S30.
while that west of the Mississippi River
increased in the later decade not much
more than half as rapidly as In the
earlier.
The Increase in the population of con
tinental United States, that is. the United
States exclusive of Alaska and the recent
insular accessions, was 13.046.SS1, or 20.7
per cent. Only one country. Argentina,
has shown by the most recent figures a
more rapid rate of growth- The present
rate of growth In continental United
States Is estimated as double the average
rate of Europe. It nearly doubles that of
Canada and exceeds by one-sixth that of
Mexico and by one-tenth that of Austra
lia.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 21.â The Census
Bureau has published as a bulletin a dis
cussion on the Increase of population In
the United States, as shown by the cen
sus of 1500. * - .
The principal results of a study of these
figures are summarized as follows:
WIDEWATER, Va., Aug. 21â Langley's
big aerodrome was placed in position on
the superstructure of the houseboat late
thl3 afternoon. The whole airship force
worked on the body, arranging machinery
and adjusting the wings, until sundown.
The flying machine was then returned to
the Interior. It was the first time that
it has been exposed to the press repre
sentatives. Her machinery and dimen
sions were plainly visible. Amidships is a
great mass of wheels, rods, boilers, pis
tons and various other mechanical de
vices. It is exceedingly complicated. The
body consists of several long steel bars
centrally located. With bowsprit and
rudder it will measure sixty feet.
Close to the motor is the navigator's
car. This is built for a weight of 150
rounds. It probably will carry Professor
Langley, who was In it repeatedly this
afternoon. The gasoline motor, which
weighs 200 pounds, generates something
In excess of twenty-seven horsepower. It
is connected by bars to propellers about
six feet in diameter and capable of re
volving 1200 times per minute. The mo
tive power is sufficient to produce a ve
locity of forty miles per hour. Placed
equally about the ship are five empty con
ical bodies designed as floats to keep the
airship up should she strike the water.
Fore and aft are two strong platforms
on each side to support the wings. These
are of delicate but rigid construction,
twenty by thirty feet, affording a sus
taining area of 800 square feet. During
the work repeated photographs of the ma
chine were made. The wings were placed
in compartments on the superstructure
and repeatedly adjusted. With good
weather conditions a test is expected
Saturday.

The Associated Press correspondent Is
f.ble to confirm, from the best source at
KctHeld. the Lancet's sta.tement that
Jyord Salisbury Is suffering from Bright's
diff&se. The ex-Premier has been suf
fering from this malady for years and
has been practically dying: since Whitsun
tide. His condition was aggravated by
the recent fall from his chair. He has
been practically unconscious for the past
twenty-four hours.
LONDON*. Aug. 21.â Since the bulletin
issued Thursday night announcing that
the condition of Lord Salisbury was crit
ical, the members of the family. Includ
ing Viscount Cranborne, Lord Arthur
Cecil, Lord Robert Cecil, the Rev. Lord
William Cecil, Lady Gwendolin Cecil, the
Esrl and Countess of Selborne and Pre
mier A. J. Balfour, who came from Scot
ler.d, have gathered in the vicinity of the
sick room awaiting the final call. It is
realized that de^th is inevitable, though
the pauent is making a wonderful strug
gle. For the past twenty-four hours he
has been fighting for every breath, helped
by a continual supply of oxygen. The
heart â¢weakness, which has keen the most
dangerous feature Fince the patient's last
seizure, is houriy becoming accentuated,
and the Marquis is gradually sinking
away, llje does not sufTer much pain and
has only 'brief periods of consciousness.
Telegrams poured in all day from nota
ble men throughout the world. Late in
the afternoon Kir.g Edward telegraphed
for additional information, though his
Majesty had been Informed by telegraph
There was a continual stream to-day of
callers in carriages and on foot.
Hatfield House, the family seat, where
the former Premier lies dying, is a
gloomy structure, although one of the
riiOEt magnificent remaining specimens of
Elizabethan architecture. It is situated
In a magnificent park which skirts the
quaint town of which the Marquis of
Salisbury is practically the owner. He
â¢was always regarded there as the type of
England's greatest nobles, and he re
tained the love and respect of all his
tenants and neighbors, which he recipro
cated in many ways, especially by open
ing Hatfield Park completely for the use
of the townspeople und residents of the
vicinity, reserving only a small portion
for his own use. This afternoon while
the statesman lay flying boys were play
ing cricket la the brilliant 6'jnshine on
the smooth lawns within earshot of the
iÂ»rpretentious room occupied by the pa
tient. This, his favorite room, overlooks
the old-fashioned and historic gardens
where Queen Elizabeth walked and
where. It is said, ehe received the first
announcement that she Â¦was Queen. While
on one elde the cricketers laughed and
chaffed each other, on the other side, and
almost equidistant from thÂ© house, was
â¢in cminous contrast, for there the work
men were finishing the grave of the
Countess of Halloway, Lord Salisbury's
half-sister, in the family burying ground.
The Countess died a few days ago, but it
i= said that Lord Salisbury was not in
formed of her death. Her funeral Trill
take place at her request at Hatfield at
noon to-morrow.
Newspaper correspondents representing
the whole press of the United Kingdom
are gathered at Hatfield anxiously await
ing further news.
The relapse commenced at 1 a. m. The
former Premier is now weaker and un
conscious.
LONDON', Aug. 22â S:30 a. m.â Lord
Salisbury is still alive, but has become
ellghtly worse since the early hours of the
morning.
PARIS, Aug. 21.â The Federal Council
of Switzerland has advised Dr. Lardy, the
Swiss Minister here and one of three ar
bitrators appointed by the Czar to de
cide the claim for preferential treatment
made by the three allied powers (Ger
many. Great Britain and Italy) in the
settlement with Venezuela, that it does
not^-deslre him to act as arbitrator, aa
Switzerland "nas Interests similar to those
of the other powers, which have been
committed to the German representative
at The Hague court. Consequently Dr.
Lardy has declined to serve as arbitrator.
Wayne MacVeagh, senior counsel 'of the
United States in the Venezuelan arbi
tration, was not surprised at Switzer
land's action in the case of Dr. Lardy,
but he expressed regret lest it might put
off the organization of the court so Ions

SINCE well-nigh everybody in the United States
and Great Britain is at this time keenly inter
ested in the contest for the America's cup Â«by
the fleetest two racing yachts ever put upon the seas,
it will doubtless be interesting to many to learn that
the America, the gallant old yacht that brought the
cup as a trophy to New York, is. still in existence
and, in most respects, is a good craft yet.
She lies at present in a snug berth near Chelsea
Bridge, at Boston, and the Globe of that city. has
recently published an elaborate'account. of her career.
Her story is romantic enough to make a historical
novel. After winning, in 1851, the yachting cup that
now bears her name, she was sold by her American
owners to an English yachtsman, Lord John ,de
Blacquiere, who, after using her for two years, ; sold
her to Lord. Templeton. In 1859 she was bought
by a speculator who, after refitting her, sent her to
the West Indies for a cruise; and in 1860^ at the out
break of the Civil War, she was bpught by the Con
federates and used as a blockade runner, in the gov
ernment service. In 1862 she was- sunk by the Con
federates in a creek near P*aiatka,Fla., to prevent her
capture by a United States squadron operating along
the coast. In due time, however, she was taken, and
having been successfully raised from the bottom of
the shallow creek, was 'towed to Port Royal, where
she was repaired and fitted out- as a vessel of the
Union navy. â¢-
In that capacity she served until the close of the
Civil War, when she was sent to Annapolis. ', where
THE AMERICA'S CAREER
It seems certain now that the powers of Europe,
with the possible exception of Germany, have deter
mined upon a concerted demonstration against Tur
key just as the sick man of Europe has rebellious
Macedonia on his hands. How strange it is that the
nations of the Old World find more to concern them
in the murder of a consular representative than in
the bloody massacre of hundreds of persecuted, help
less Jews. It speaks well for the power of Russia.
AUSTRALIA seems destined to present the
world with a continuous show of social prob
lems. Her latest in that line is a census report
revealing a birth rate so low that it barely exceeds
that of France. Sociologists are having a hard time
in their efforts to find out the cause of the low rate.
The doctrine of Malthus does not apply, for Australia
is a new land, with a rich soil and a scant population,
and there is no pressure upon the' food supply. The
doctrine of Francis Walker that the low birth rate
in New England is due to the pressure of foreign
immigration, which has lowered the standard of liv
ing, does not fit the Australian situation, for there
has been no heavy immigration to any of the prov
inces. Neither does the theory of the French econo
mists that the low birth rate in France is due to law
requiring a division of the real estate of the parents
equally among the. children fit the case in Australia,
for no such law exists there arid no land scarcity is
feared.
In short, none of the prevalent theories of the
cause of a decline in birth rate, fits the requirements
of the Australian situation. The Australians are not
a weak, a decadent nor a degenerate people. On
the contrary, they are the first descendants of a race
of pkmeers and all the world knows that pioneers are
among the strongest of men and women. Neverthe
less, the facts are indisputable. For one reason or
another, the Australians are averse to marriage and
to children and are breeding hardly fast enough to
keep up the population.
A" summary of the report of Dr. Coghlan, the
Government statistician of New South Wales, says:
"He gives the birth rate per iooo inhabitants of the
various states as follows: West Australia, 30.49; Tas
mania, 28.39: Queensland, 28.36; New South Wales,
27.60; New Zealand, 26.30; Victoria, 25.77, and South
Australia, 25.09. More trustworthy information, he
thinks, can be obtained by comparing the number of
married women under the age of 45, years' with the
number of births. In 1901 in New South Wales there
only 235 birthsper 1000 of married women of child
bearingage, while in 1886 there were 339. He gives
the following as .the legitimate birth rates T ori -this
basis: .Victoria, 228.6; New South .Wales, 235.3;
South Australia, 235.9; West Australia, 243.9; New
Zealand, 246.1; Queensland, 254; Tasmania, 260.C In
1 89 1 t" the average for Australasia 7 was about '276 per
iooo, while the average of the foregoing rates is 239.
The illegitimate birth is slightly lo\ver> than for some
years, being 16.23 in 1891, so this in no way accounts
for the falling off of other births." ' V/ ; '
That is *a hard showing for a. new country whose
people have so' much ambition as the Australians.
It seems to be. a land where race .suicide is practiced
as a part of. the general scheme of state socialism,
and perhaps the two things may be more; closely re
lated than aooears on the surface.

you from us bo long.
We know but too well how your life of self

We hope, therefore, that you will accept this
small offering as a token of the love and es

ere long you may be "restored In health and
vigor to your flock.

FATHER O'NEHj GIVEN
GENEBOUS TESTIMONIAL
NO insurrection that has afflicted the European
continent has shown such stubborn persist
ence as that instigated by the Macedonian
comxrmtee and raging in the Balkans. The Turkish
frontier is nearly equally divided in population be
tween Christians and Mahometans, and, as is always
the case in such contacts, each party is more fanatical
than when the distance between them is wider.
The Government of the empire of Turkey is a
spectacle of sodden administration, excelled only by
the ignorance, theft and brutality of the Latin-Amer
ican states. Taxes are farmed out and the contract
ors extort far beyond the natural burden of govern
ment, exacting as they are. In the districts of mixed
religions the laws, of course, are administered by
Turks, who do not exert themselves to be easy on
their Christian neighbors. When added to these
sins of misgovernment and oppression by public
authority is constant friction over religious differ
ences, there is presented the saddest situation that
afflicts the modern world.
The Balkan Christians seem determined to persist
until they compel a European war. They succeed
in exasperating the Turks to murder foreign Consuls
in the border towns, and possibly do not scruple to
take a pot shot at a Consul under circumstances that
make the crime chargeable to the Mahometans. Rus
sia has lost two or three of her Consular representa
tives in this way, and the Sultan has nearly exhausted
his list of apologies to the Russian Minister in Con
stantinople. The Austrian, French and Italian Con
suls feel very insecure and would accept a bomb
proof or cancellation of their exequatur with equal
pleasure.
The causes of the contention are as old as the
appearance of the Turk in Europe. For a long time
the Turks dominated Southeastern Europe and
threatened Austria and Russia. They ruled far up
the Danube, and had it not been for John Sobieski,
the Pole, would have entered and held Vienna. In
diplomacy they have been as successful as formerly
in war. Seated in a country that every Continental
nation would gladly own, they are protected by the
unwillingness of them all to let any one get' it
The Christians of Southeastern Europe have never
Ceased in their fanatical hatred of the Turk, and the
Turk has paid it back to the Christian, with interest
The present war is characterized on both sides by
abandoned savagery. The Christians burn mosques
full of worshiping Mahometans like rats in a straw
stack, and massacre with an indiscrimination that is
equaled only by the Turks themselves.
There seems to be no scarcity of guns and ammu
nitions among the insurgents, while Ttirkeyâbank
rupt, corrupt, wicked and degenerate â has only the
unfailing magazine of .Moslem" fanaticism to draw
upon. It is the belief of the Macedonian committee
that if the contest can be kept up long enough, Chris
tian Europe, and especially the nations that border
on the bloody scene, will be compelled to interfere.
It is a pitiful commentary on European and Christian
statesmanship that mutual jealousy between the
Christian powers is the actual cause of the Balkan
situation. Motives of state and dynastic ambitions,
pride of position and fear of a change in the balance
of power keep the Turk in Europe and Europe in a
turmoil.

PERSONAL MENTION.
REPORTS that President Roosevelt might call
the proposed extra session of Congress as
early as October have resulted in bringing to
him a host of protests from Congressmen in all
States where there are to be elections this fall. The
statesmen. do not wish to be in Washington when
the local campaigns are going on. It is fence-mend
ing time with them, and they are unwilling to give
up any portion of it to the task of discussing either
the Cuban treaty or the question of currency reform.
A Washington dispatch reviewing the numerous
protests says: "As viewed here, the advantages of
assembling Congress in October are more than offset
by its disadvantages. If such a course is persisted
in it is not thought possible to bring to Washington
the Senators and' members who have local elections
in their States. They would demand, as one of them
said in a telegram to-day,' even if the session were'
called, that nothing be done until the. full member
ship could leave their States and participate in the
discussion." â¢ : Â¦
As the sole object .of calling Congress together as
early as October is that of benefiting members of
Congress, it is quite likely the numerous protests will
incline the President to make the call for November
instead of the earlier date. It 'was believed that the
advantages of an early session would overweigh any
opposing considerations. By meeting in October,
Congress could get itself organized, finish the Cuban
and the currency business, and thus be so well ad
vanced that the work of the regular session could be
completed in time for an early adjournment next
summer. That, of course, would be a great gain, for
it would release the Congressmen of their duties in
Washington in time for them to take an active part
in the preliminaries of the Presidential campaign.
It appears, however, that the old principle, "A bird
in the hand is worth two in the bush," applies in this
case, for the statesmen evidently deem a local elec
tion this year to be more important than a Presiden-
tial election that is to take place next year. Of
course, when next year comes many of those who
are now protesting against a meeting in October will
wish they had held their peace and met in time to
finish, early next- summer. That, however, is their
lookout, and not that of the President The. issue is
one of no great concern to the country at large. The
people desire to see the reciprocity treaty beaten and
an effective currency bill passed before the holidays,,
so that the regular session will not be too much pro
longed. If that can be. achieved by as late
as November, there will be no objection to the post
ponement. Fortunately, the outlook is promising. |
It seems that the reciprocity debate will not take up
much time, while the announcement that Senator
Gorman has decided not to lead or take part in a
fight against a Republican currency bill gives prom
ise that even that measure can be settled after a
comparatively short discussion.

The State Board of Equalization, inspired by a

protest of Assessor Dodge, who declares that he has
adequately taxed the property owners of this city.
While the metropolis is willing, even eager, to show
its good will to the rest of the State, and even to ac
cept burdens not rightly its own, it objects to bear
ing all the responsibilities which are involved in the
march of prosperity. ;.*;"
Failures this week number 238 in the
United States, against 207 last year, and 8
in Canada, compared with 30 a year ago.
Business is well maintained aside from
the quieting Influence of the vacation
season,' Â¦which somewhat restricts trade
and retards collections. Making due al
lowance for the period," there is no cause
for complaint. The adverse factors that
have been operating against prosperity in
recent preceding weeks are no longer as
potent, normal influences gradually pre
vailing. Labor controversies still exist,
curtailing the output of a few products
and the consumption of all the necessa
ries of life. Crops are not going to mar
ket as freely as usual, although the agri
cultural outlook Is distinctly favorable.
In spite of several obvious reasons for
expecting a check to freight traffic earn
ings of railways thus far reported In Aug
ust, show an average gain* of 9.6 per cent
over last year, and 18.2 per cent over 1901.
Complaint Is beginning to be heard re
garding the inadequate facilities of the
railways, and it now appears that incon
venience and loss must be again expe
rienced, notwithstanding the extensive
improvements.
A fairly liberal tonnage of Iron has been
placed during the past week, providing
abundant demand for all the pig that is
being made.
Somewhat easier prices for the great
food staples -testify to greater crop pros
pects.
Weakness In Southern foundry iron is
noted at Eastern markets, and Bessemer
pig iron is reported offered $1 per ton
lower at Pittsburg than a week ago, with
supplies for immediate delivery more in
evidence. Large buying of pig iron is less
noticeable than it was one or two weeks
ago, but quite a. number of small orders
have been booked. Steel billets are less
active, but fairly firm. Merchant bars,
sheets and plates in finished products are
reported in much better call, but the de
mand for structural material Is light,
particularly reflecting recent labor trou
bles. Copper was marked up this week,
partially It is thought to affect the stock
market quotations, but some large sales
below the official price are reported.
Wheat (Including flour) exports for the
week ending August 20 aggregate 3,372,769
bushels, against 3,413.191 bushels last
week, 5,954,759 bushels in the same week
last year, 6,606,950 bushels In 1901 and 2,695,
163 bushels in 1900.
Business failures in the United States
for the .week ending August 20 number
166, against 160 last week, 1S1 in the like
week of 1902, 1S1 in 1901, 135 in 1900 and 154
in 1899. â¢ .
In Canada failures for the week number
14, as against 17 last week and 23 In this
week a year ago.
NORMAL CONDITIONS PREVAIL.
R. G. Dun & Cp.'s weekly review of
trade to-morrow will say:
Among the great Industries few im
portant changes are noted. One of the
notable 'developments is the general soft
ening of pig iron prices following the
heavy buying of two weeks past. Fewer
industrial operatives are on strike now
than for months past, but the idleness of
cotton mill operatives tends rather to In
crease. The lumber trade is active West
and North, but in the East it has not as
ye,t recovered from the depression in
duced by labor troubles, now about draw
ing to a close. Shoe manufacturing is
notably active the country over, and
Eastern, shipments are breaking all rec
ords. Railway earnings for the first half
of August continue to show good gains.
The Eastern jewelry trade Is quiet for
the season, and the labor situation is not
a very clear one. Leather is reported firm
but quiet.
BESSlfMER PIG IRON LOWER.
NEW YORK, Aug. 21.â Bradstreet's to
morrow will say: Weather and crop con
ditions are still the keynote to fall trade.
In the Northwest, Southwest and South
buyers are taking hold energetically, and
reports as a whole are as good or better
than a year ago. In the East fall job
bing has started in well, though perhaps
not so actively as hoped for. Some soft
spots are, however, noted in tho Central
West sections, in which crops yielded
lighter than hoped for. The retail trade
is seasonably quiet and collections are
reported backward In a number of in
stances.
Mrs. Isabel Castro de Francolin!. once
wealthy and beautiful, lay on a slab In
the Morgue yesterday, unsought by
friends and unnoticed. Her landlady at
109 Montgomery street knocked at the
door of her humble room yesterday to
awaken her, and, receiving no response to
her summons, opened the door â¢with a
pass key and found the once proud Span
ish beauty lying dead in bed, with a small
cologne bottle half full of perfume clasped
in her right hand. The poor woman had
been ailing with pains in the region of
the heart for some months. She was a
daughter of Gabriel Castro of . the old
Spanish family that owned leagues of
land around- San Francisco Bay and was
a niece of General Vallejo, In whose honor
the city of Vallejo was named.
The decedent had been twice married,
her first husband being A. H. Gildemeis
ter. After his death she married Count
Antoine Raymond de Francolini and he
died in France March 4, 1902. His estate
was so much lncumbered that all that
was left for the widow was an income of
$12 per annum. In 1886 John K. Moore
deeded Mrs. Francolini certain lots In the
block bounded by Franklin, Gough. Geary
and O'Farrell streets in this city for the
named consideration of $25,000. A few
years ago she brought suit against the
city and county of San Francisco to quiet
title to valuable realty bounded by Val
lejo, Franklin and Lyon streets and high
water mark 'on the bay, but the suit was
decided against her. Recently a subscrip
tion was started among her friends for
the purpose of assisting her to return to
France, but It was, never completed.
Mrs. Francolini was 55 years old and
spent the last of her days In poverty. She

was a high argument in maintenance of the thesis
that it is to science we owe the best of law and art
and industry as they exist to-day, and it is to science
we must look for nobler laws, higher arts and more
profitable industries in the future. In short, science
is the lord of human life and its servants are the
best ministers to human welfare.
Contrasting the honors paid to lawmakers, states
men, warriors, artists and the great captains of in
dustry, with -the indifference shown by the masses of
the people toward men of science, he said: "The, fact,
that we do not as yet recognize this irresistible power
of science as a subject of daily thought and experi
ence is the reason why the feeling of reverence does
not arise in us with such strength when we think
of science as it does when we think of these things
whose greatness and strength we have been accus
tomed to honor from our youth up. But when we |
have once learned to look upon science as that which i
controls our whole life, then we know of nothing
more powerful nor more worthy of reverence."
It is unquestionably true that we do not as yet in
our daily thoughts realize the immense benefits that
have been conferred upon our generation by the
achievements of men of science within the last cen
tury. When we have occasion to contrast the rich
ness of life to-day with the harshness and poverty of
that of a century ago, it is almost inevitable that we
either take the credit to ourselves as a people and
say we are better than our fathers, or' else we attrib
ute it *to some warrior -or statesman, or railroad
builder, and ignore utterly the men whose patient
and keen research in narrow confines of laboratories,
or the wide fields of land and ocean, have discovered !
the truths and mastered the forces which alone have
made possible the progress of which we are so
proud.
Professor Ostwald did not attempt to sum up or
even to outline in the most general terms the extent
of the benefits that the increase of that body of
knowledge known as "science" has conferred upon
civilized men of every grade and class; nor, indeed,
could he have adequately dealt with, that phase of
the subject in so brief an address. Some estimate of
it may, however, be inferred from the computation
made in France at the time of the foundation of the
Pasteur Institute, that by his addition to the sum of
knowledge applied to the silk, wine, dairy and stock
raising industries, Pasteur had- augmented the wealth
of France alone by a sum in excess of the enormous*
indemnity demanded by the Germans at the close
of the disastrous war which overthrew the throne of
Napoleon.
Ii the researches of a single man produced so much
wealth for a single country in a single generation, it
is clearly impossible to calculate the total aggregate
of the wealth added to the whole civilized world
by the entire body of scientists. Great as. is the value
of this material gain, however, it is not the whole nor
even the greatest part of the total benefit to human
ity of scientific research. The comfort, the health,
the happiness of men have been aided and advanced
as much as their material wealth. Professor Ostwald
made an interesting statement of the manner in which
art itself had been lifted to higher levels of excellence
and enabled to express itself through finer forms of
beauty by science. rt When one recalls," he said, "the
history of any of the completed periods of art â for
example, that of Greek sculpture â one sees how, step
by Step, the development of this art has been de
pendent upon increasing knowledge. * * * One
also sees hew in such cases the degree of artistic
development always corresponds to the degree of
technical development." Interesting, too, is his
other statement: "It is likewise possible for us to
think of times when the ninth symphony will not
longer be able to produce any greater effect than is
now produced by a symphony of Haydn's."
Science, in short, is not only knowledge, but it is
human life raised to its highest power. It is the
progressive element of humanity. It has achieved
much, even in the face of popular indifference, and
when its worth is fully recognized it will achieve far
more, because mankind will then be more prompt to
take advantage of its teaching. Such being the case,.
Dr. Jacques Loeb, who is to have charge of the work
of the laboratory, was quite right in saying: "The
opening.of the new laboratory, which is pre-eminently
intended for scientific. Tesearch, is an event in which
everybody may rejoice and which no one rfeed re
gret, for it is the function of all scientific research
to increase the possibility and the value of life."

Can you imagine anything more graphic? The suspense is so keen
that it hurts. And yet that is only the closing incident of the first chan-
ter of "Brewster's Millions," which beqins in the next Sunday Call. In
point of fact "Brewster's Millions" is absolutely unlike anvthintr that
has ever been written before, for In it a perfectly adorable vouner fellow
,ias to spend a million a year, get his money's worth and yet have abso-
lutely nothing. to show for it at the end of that time in order that he mav
inherit six million more. Sounds fascinating, doesn't it? Well, it is
more than that.
But the popular craze for literature of the bright, snappy, up-to-date
sort goes even further than this. Never before was there such a tre-
mendous demand for short stories of thr best sort. And what better
reading could you Ret? A pood short story is a complete novel in con-
densed form, and it is iust such evcellent reading as this, that is pro-
vided in the Sunday Call's new "Half Hour Storiettes." of which, next
â¢Sunday, you will jjet two full pa^e?. Here are some of the titles:
"Mysterious Leofric." "In the Fi3<h of Striped Death," "The Secret of
the Jamaica Sink Hole." "The Beautiful Miss Marrwm." "Fahlea for
the Foolish," "Shortv Mahan's Passirc." "Love'Â« Golden Tether."
"While the Train Waited." "What Tiny Peter Did," etc.. etc. Best of
all there is a new short storv by A. Oman , Doyle. "The Shadow Be-
fore": "Millions in His Dreams." by Marie Twain: "Me-ows of a Kitty.**

Why? Because not one writer in a hundred knows a good story when

makes "literary genius." Better than all else, it's the only quality that
sells books. Just take a peep at this little extract from a book that the
whole country is talking about and you'll realize, perhaps for the first

NEW YORK. Aug. 21.â Sir Thomas Lip
ton late to-night, standing on the deck
ci the Erin, felt the fresh wind on his
face and looked greatly pleased.
"1 hope it will continue," he said. "I
want a wholesale wind to-morrow, and
if it comes I am confident Shamrock will
win. I am more confident than ever be
fore. The race on Thursday was a fluke.
If the wind had been good the result
would have been different. Reliance be
ing the loftier boat, caught the upper
light air that was moving, and that helped
her. In a breeze such as is betokened
now for to-morrow there'll be a different

Sir Thomas dined to-night with a party
cf friends on the Erin and retired shortly
after midnight.

"This is satisfying." he said, as he
stood on the deck of the Sunbeam and
looked toward the southwest, whence
came the breeze. "This means good
times for Reliance to-morrow. I am just
as certain that she will win as I have
been at any time, and why should 1 not
be? So far everytliing has proved quite
gratifying, it seems to me, but I do hope
we will not have any more walking
matches. 1 want to see a good stiff
breeze for a trying out to-morrow a::d I
hope we will get it."
Reliance this morning cast loose from
her moorings, Fet her jib and staysail
and stood out into the bay for a sail.
Shortly afterward Shamrock III hoiste'd
her mainsail with the apparent intention
<>f going out for a sail-stretching. Re
liance, after several short hitches and
maneuvers in Sandy Hook Bay, returned
to her moorings. The challenger left her
anchorage, set jib and staysail and on
the starboard tack headed out to the
Point.
Sir Thomas Lipton, his captains and the |
crews of his fleet at Sandy Hook were by ;
no means disheartened to-day. Sir Thorn- |
sb was as optimistic as u^ual and cheer- j
fully explained that yesterday'? race was i
nwt conclusive, while Captain Wringe of I
the Shamrock III was as good natured j
and hopeful as ever. All appeared to be- !
l<eve that there would be a different story
to tell if the n^xt race were sailed in a
fair racing wir:d. It was pointed out by
t:i. officer of the Erin to-day that the
Shamrock ?II had never been exceedingly
fast in drifting. The only race in which
the Shamrock I ever beat her was sailed
in little better than a calm and in many
cases under similar conditions the Sham
rock III had been unable to drop her
'pacemaker until the wind increased to
five knots or better, after which she
showed a remarkable Increase in r^peed.

Made by its oririnators C. L Hood Co.. pro-
prietors Hood'f tSawaparilla. Lowell MubSir T. C. O'Brien, who vm one of the
strongest Middlesex batsmen some years
ago, will brine a team to the 4-nlted
Slates next month at the invitation of
the Philadelphia cricketers In England.
It is proposed to play against the Phtla
delphians now visitint England on Sep
tember 13, 39 and 21 at Philadelphia;
against a Baltimore team at Baltimore
on September 22 and 23; against all-Phila
delphia at Philadelphia on September 25,
IS and 2S; acalnst all-New York at llo~
bokrn or Staten Island on September
=9 and 30: acalnst the Philadelphia Colts
at Philadelphia on October 1, 2 and 4;
against all-Canada at Toronto on Octo
ber 8. 9 and 11. The team "will probably
consist of Irish players only and will be
known as the Gentlemen of Ireland.
There is an unusual number of fine crick
eter* in Ireland this year. The Irish teams
have come oft well In several matches
â¢*a!nst EnÂ£lisn county elevens.
The. team made up by the Marylebone
Cricket Club of England to send to Aus
tralia is not yet settled. P. F. Warner
of the Middlesex County eleven, captain
of Ivord Hawke's team of cricketers who
visited San Francisco last November, was
chosen captain. A. C. Maclaren, one of
the strongest English batsmen, refused
to Dlay under him. A good deal of ill
feeling seems to have been excited.
British Cricketers Coming.
Perhaps the Coast League will find room
for the best of them, but they cannot all
bo used, so many will be turned adrift.
Then the hard struggle will commence, as
it Is too late in the season to go East.
Opposition is a great thing for the ball
player while Its lasts, but "when It comes
to an end the talent suffers extremely,
as will soon be illustrated in the Pacific
National League situation.
The management Of the Pacific Coast
League states that none of the jumpers,
such as Martin Glendon, Jesse Stovall,
Jack Lawler and Johnny Burns, will
ever be allowed to play In the Pacific
Coast League again. The coast people
seem emphatic in their decision and say
these men are doomed as far as coast
baeeball goes.
There are many star players who have
not jumped any contracts and they may
be seen In harness In one or more of the
Coast League teams. Already several of
the Tacoma players have been snapped
up and It is likely many more of the -best
performers In the disbanded teams will
also be hired to play In the Coast League.
1 For instance, Charley Rellly has a team
of stars, any one of whom could easily
make good in the Coast League. All of
them are eligible to come over, excepting
JLstck Walters, who Jumped his contract
with. Parke Wilson's Seattle team at the
begirinini; 'â¢ of s the season. Rellly himself
would-be a good man for. some team, but
lie may not bo wanted at all as far as
that goes. -i
THE market will be flooded with ball
players good, bad and indifferent,
now that the Pacific National
League Is at the end of Its rope and ready
to call off the fight. Just what is to be
come^of these ambitious gentlemen, the
balltossers, Is a question that will inter
est both themselves and the baseball pub
lic.
ON the schedule of the California
Cricket Association the event set
down for to-morrow is the return
match between the Alameda and Santa
Cruz clubs at Santa Cruz. It will, how
ever, not be played, Harold WaYd, cap
tain of the Alameda Club, having received
a communication from Secretary Stagg
of the Santa Cruz Cricket Club express
ing regret that it was found- impossible
to get an eleven together to meet ' the
visitors.
The Alameda men are disappointed, as
they had been looking forward to tho
visit to the seaside town. They also feel
somewhat aggrieved, as this is the sec
ond or third occasion on which the Santa
Cruz eleven has failed to play Its return
match against the Alameda team, when
Santa Cruz was to be the scene of > the
game. The Santa Cruz eleven, of course,
forfeits the pennant match, which will
add two points to the score of tho Ala
medans, raising their percentage. The
Alameda captain had made up a strong
eleven to take down to Santa Cruz and
was confidently expecting an Interesting
game.
Â£ As the match set down between '.the
Alameda and Santa - Cruz clubs for to
morrow at the seaside town has ' fallen
through, the game arranged for the 30th
Inat. between the San Francisco County
and Pacific clubs will be played to-mor
row on the grounds at Webster street,
Alameda. The Pacific eleven will be
picked from H. C. Casidy, A. W. Wild-
Ing, E. T. Langdale, H. D. Bowly, F.
Bennlon, E. H. Lannowe, W. Petherick,-
Dr. O. N. Taylor, C. C. Y. Williamson,
W. Jamleson.-C. W. Johnson, J. J. Theo
bald, W. G. Fortmann and H. N. Stores.
The San Francisco County representa
tives will be chosen from the following:

There will be first and second prizes In
each event besides the challenge trophies.
The A. G. Spauldlng challenge cup for
men's singles was won by George F.
Whitney in 1901 and by L. R, Freeman In
1902. It must be won three times, not
necessarily consecutively.
All matches in which women compete
will be two sets out of three. Heretofore
the finals have been three out of five, but
the governing body in the East decided
that all women's matches should be two
out of three. All matches In men'a
events will be three sets out of five. Play
will begin each day at 10 a. m., continu
ing as the committee may direct. Play
ers not appearing when called upon to
play will be promptly defaulted. Tho fol
lowing committee will be In charge: W.
B. ColllerT S. C. Gay ness. Homer Hotch
klss. Alexander Beyfusa and Grant M.
Smith. R. N. Whitney will act as referee.
There will be no tournaments on the
park courts until the new asphalt courts
now being built are completed. There
will be a big tournament In the early part
of October.
The singles challenge matches, both
men's and women's, will" be played on
September 9. The doubles challenge
matches will both bo played Saturday.
September 5. The mixed doubles chal
lenge match will be played Monday, Sep
tember 7.
The winners of the different events will
be called upon to play the present cham
pions. They are as follows: Lewis R.
Freeman.' men's single: L. R- Freeman
and Alfonso Bell, men's doubles; Miss
May Sutton. women's singles; Misses
May and Violet Sutton, women's doubles;
Miss Gabriel Dobbins and A. E. Bell,
mixed doubles..
Should the Easterners come the chances
are tho drawing in the men's singles ami
doubles will be "seeded." In doubles
Wright and Ward would be put in one
half and MacGavin ami Smith in the
other. This would insure a good match
in the final as well as In the challenge
round. In singles it would be advisable
to "seed" Bell, MacGavin, Smith, Collier.
Ward and Wright.
The tournament will begin on the 21st
inst. at 10 a. m. and will be finished Sep
tember 9. The order of events will be as
follows: lien's singles, Wednesday. Sep

cents for each additional event. Entries

The drawings will be held at the Califor
nia Tennis Club, Scott and Bush streets.
at 5 p. m. df the same day. Entries
should be sent to W. B. Collier Jr.. 2503

WITH tho annual coast champion
ship tennis tournament Â«but a
week away little time remains for
the cracks to round. Into form. A!l of
the experts are doing their utmost to be
at their best in case they should be called
upon to play the Eastern champions.
It 13 almost a certainty that Beals
Wright and Holcombe Ward will journey
to the coast and participate In the com
ing tournaments. With these men irr the
ranks the events will be the most inter
esting ever held on the coa3t. Wright
and Ward both rank among the first five
players In the United States, and al
though they are not a regular doubles
team they will make a strong combina
tion.
The Corinthian fleet returned last Sun
day from the annual cruise up the Sac
ramento River. Commodore E. F. Sager
carried his flag on the sloop Emma, which
was accompanied by the sloops Speedwell,
Merope, Elsie, Belle, Aeolus, Meteor and

for the past four years. He beat Hilton.
In the last contest for the amateur cham
pionship of Great Britain. H. G. B. Ellis
has been described by Horace Hutchlnson
as "the stralghtest player, In the world."
He has an easy, beautiful swing and fin
ishes high over his head. D. Ransome
has played for the University of Cam
bridge. A. C. M. Croome. and C. N. -Day

Vallejo Yachting Club to Sausalito, with
time allowances. This is the second Val
lejo race of the present year, the first
having taken place on Sunday. May 31.
As only three boats finished on that day,
the wind being light and fluky, and four
cups were offered, the fourth was raced
for on Sunday, July 5, between the sloop3
Thetis, Surprise and Halcyon, the first
named winning. The schooner Chispa and

This is the car that was ppecially de
signed by Alexander Wlnton for the re
cent race in Ireland for the Gordon Ben
nett trophy and â¢ut6mobilists .would
be delimited to have an opportunity of
eyeing it here.
cThe automobiliets of this city, whether
private owners or dealers, are strongly in
favor of the meet and the principal dif
ficulty will be to find a competent man
ager who will take all the details of the
affair In hand. It Is proposed to hold a
meet in Los Angeles Immediately after
the Ean Francisco tournament, so that
t'.ie men from the Eastern Elates can take
part in both events.

n^HE recent tournament of th"? Auto

A Mon'e was fo successful an.1 excited
to much interest amor; the automobilists
snd the public that other meets are rcn
tprtplated. It is thought likely the man
agers of the F.tate Fair at Sacramento
will make arrangements for an afternoon
of automobile racing and that a meet may
be held 8t Frepno in October. J. Parker
Lyon. the president of the automobile
Club of Fresno, attended the Del Monte
meet and believe? that Fr>me interesting
races could be arranged in his city.
A meeting r>f the directors of the Auto
mobile Club of California and well known
San Franrtsco automobilists was held yes
terday, at which F. A. Hyde, president;
E Courtney Ford, vice president, and E.
P. Brinepar, secretary of the club; C. A.
Hawkins, G. A. Boyer and others were
present. The project was discussed of
holding a large meeting; on the Ingleside
race track in October or November and
of bringing out Henri Fournier. who is
about to r<--turn to the United States; Bar
rey OlflfleM and other famous automobile
racing men. Barney Oldfield Is one of
the most brilliant and daring of automo
bile racing men, allowing the rear wheels
of his machine to Ekid at the curves in a
truly alarminjj manner. He has been en
paged for the rest of the season at least

"While we were In the North and the
Northwest we made money, but since we
reached Los 'Angeles there is nothing for
us to play for. In fact, there is nothing
in the way ( , of opposition to bo looked
after, as Morley and Harris 'have every
thing their own way. Regarding next
year I cannot say, but I think it is Mr.
Hart's idea to form a six or eight team
league,' to incVude San Francisco. Sacra
mento. Oakland, Los Angeles. Fresno,
BakerBdeld. Santa Barbara or San Diego
and San Jose, where the teams would
give good ball and with first class play
ers and both leagues work in harmony
with each other. Hart has not said any
thing about this league, but -he knows
that Morley and Harris are after such
a combination and probably it will be
made." , - .
T. J. Meyers. Hart's representative,
who is in Los Angeles, was given au
thority to pay all players and other credi
tors up to last night. Orders were also
given to take tho San Francisco team
home. The team left on to-night's Owl
train. In an interview to-night Meyers
eaid:
It is not known if the order affects the
San Francisco Club, but similar action
regarding that team is expected, as both
clubs are controlled by the same interr
ests., Durlnsr the present week the at
tendance at the two srames, the first
played by the Pacific National l^eague in
Fix weeks, has been light. The local team
has been a losing venture in its homo se
ries ever since it was established here,
having failed to draw from tho start.
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 21. -Orders to
disband the Los Angeles Club of
the Pacific National Baseball League

FOR HAWTHORNE
AT BRIGHTON
T> HE annual meeting and election of
I officers of the Academic Athletic
A League was held last night In the
rooms of the Pacific Athletic Association
in the Emma Spreckels building.
As but one candidate was nominated
for each office, the secretary cast the bal
lot for the board. The new officers are:
E.. B. Gould of Stockton High School,
president; W. J. Palethorpe, vice presi
dent; Will Potts, secretary; L. D. Ins
keep, treasurer; P. K. Rausch, delegate to
the Pacific Athletic Association; auditor,
Fred Koch.
The sensation of the meeting was the
fact that the name of Herbert Hauser,
supposed to be the only candidate, was
not presented when nominations were
called for the office of president; From
his long association with athletics it was
thought he would make an excellent head
for the league, which is in a prosperous
condition. He had the avowed support of
the delegates of the country schools, but
they were not present at the meeting to
vote. Another faction of the league
brought ilr. Gould from under cover at
the last moment when It was supposed
there would be no .opposition and he ap
peared as the only candidate before the
meeting. .
The date of the semi-annual field day
was fixed for October 11 on Berkeley oval.
The final football game for the champion
ship of the league will be played on No
vember 7.

QNARATOGA, N. Y.. Aug. 21.-Short
Hose easily beat his four opponents
in the Huron handicap. He was
heavily played. Short Hose stumbled at
the start, but quickly recovered and went
after the leaders. The pace was slow oy
comparison with other races run here
when thÂ«* track was In first-class condi
tion, which it was not to-day. When
Haack got ready he lot Short Hose have
hia head and the rest was easy.
Close observers of the third race, a
handicap for 2-year-olds, say that Mon
ster was the best horse in the race, Judg
hift from the fact that he was the list
to get in motion and was closing fast in
the last eighty yards, after having made
an extraordinary wide turn. He finished
fourth. Summaries:

GREAT BATTING RALLY.
Â£"> OMETIMES errors do not count for
anything- in a ball same. Then again
as cure as a player fumbles the ball
fcr a moment runs are bound to score
anu the game is lost. So H was yesterday
at Recreation Park. Men on both Fides
made mistakes and these mistakes coijnt
od and let in runs. The visitors erred
more often and they therefore ran sec
ond. Score, San Francisco 2, Portland 1.
There should have been no runs peered.
As soon a* the fielders settled down and
began to play ball the making of tallies
oame abruptly to an end. It was a brill
iant exhibition from the tap of the gong
and might have been won by either team
had a batting rally been pulled off at tfio
right moment.
McFarlan, the new Portland pitcher, ex
hibited himself on the local field for the
first time. After he threw the first ball
it was the unanimous opinion of the fans
that he was the goods and could pitch in
any league. He Is a tall, slender chap
with Dclsarte movements and a bunch of
speed and wld$ breaks on his curves. He
doei? not use a mitt, something unusual
for a ball player in this present age of ad
vanced civilization and more advanced
baseball. He has a nice, easy delivery
and uses excellent judgment. He let the
home team down with seven hits and
they were all scattered. In the first round
they made their only runs. They werÂ» db
tained on errors and should never have
t>e-n scored.
* Snay was passed to first, receiving the
only walk of the game. Then McFarlan
executed a balk and Shay went to socond,
where he was caught napping soon after.
Meany was given a life on Van Buron's
error and Irwin landed with a two-bag-
K(>r. Leahy hit to tliirO and Frar.cis
threw to the plate to catch Meany. Shea
dropped the ball, allowing the first run to
register. Pabst flew to right and Irwin
trotted in from third with what proved to
be th>=- winning tally of the game.
Jimmy Whaler, held the Portlands well
under ibe spell of his majrlo shoots during
e\Â«ay round of the trouble. An error by
lrv.in let the only visitor reach the p;in.
It happened in the fourth when Naueau
drtibl^d to richt Hold and advanced or
Anderson'* out. He was caught napning
at third and Tommy I^ahy whipped the
bail down in order to he?d him off. Ir

GRASS VALLEY, Aug. 21^-Great ex

borhood of Shebley's sawmill, on Green
horn Creek, over the appearance of a
band of men supposed to be the Folsom
escapes. Just at dusk a stranger walked
out of the brush to the camp cookhouse
and asked for food. The Chinese gave
him a quantity and the stranger left. He
was quiet In demeanor and apparently.

VALLEJO. Aug. 21.â The finding of an
old tin can that contained gold coin worth
over $500 was the agreeable experience
of a laborer here yesterday.
The lucky man, with others, was en
gaged excavating for the foundation of
the proposed Sailors" Clubhouse, upon the
lot purchased by Captain B. H. McCalla
out of his Spanish- American -war prize
money. The man wjio found the money
Is named Leichter.
The find of this can of gold revives the
story that the late Charles Murphy, who
was a prominent contractor here in early
days and formerly owned the lot referred
to and lived thereon for many years, one
night hid a large sum of money about
the premises, but was not afterward able
to locate it.
Yesterday 1 * find and the circulation of
the Murphy story have made popular tho
work of excavating for the Sailors' Club
house and ' there, are many - roqueats for
employment.

Kleemann of Portland was drowned this
morning: while surf bathing on the ocean
beach at Nye Creek In full view of 1000

enjoyment of riding over the swells
tempted the young man to venture out
too far from, shore. He soon became ex
hausted and cried for help. Two other
Lathers succeeded !n reaching Kleemann
and made a desperate effort to reach the
phore with him, but the current seemed
to set off shore and they could make lit

compelled to give" up their task to save
their own lives. In the meantime others
rushed to the bathhouse for Hfe-prev

being found and fastened together. It
was not long enough, however, and to
lengthen the line the bathers joined
hands and formed a human life line ex

unfortunate young man.
FIDE SUSPECTS
ALARM A CAMP
PORTLAND, Me., Aug. 21.â A the
oretically hostile fleet sailed from
the tropics to-day to attack Port
land, and eecret service agents
notified the United States Gov
ernment of the fact. In this way began
the mimic war in which detachments of
the United States army and the com
bined fleet of the North Atlantic squadron
are to take part during the next ten days.
The fleet which is supposed to be Balling
toward Portland really is at anchor off
Rockland, where it will remain for the
two days which would be consumed if
It was actually approaching from the
tropics. Then tho vessels will appear in
this harbor and commence operations.
In the meantime, prompted by the im
aginary receipt this forenoon of news
of the advance of the enemy's ships, the
army of defense will assemble and pre
pare lt.Â«>elf for the protection of the har
bor and the city. The local batteries,
being the first naturally to hear the news
of the. threatening danger, responded
promptly and by noon all the companies
had gone Into camp and taken up^actlve
duties. The First and Second regiments,
which constitute the entire State militia,
started as soon as notified for Portland
and they were in camp In good season.
Before Sunday night additional forces
from Massachusetts, Rhode Island and
Delaware were ready to assist in pre
venting the operations of the enemy from
being successful.
Major General Chaffee Is to command
the land forces. The enemy will be un^
der Rear Admiral Barker.
Rear Admiral Barker has received
eealed instructions relating to the attack.
The contents are unknown to General
Chaffee. in command of the army. Ac
cording to the rules for the maneuvers

located at Guantanamo and Culecbra, are
covered by a superior allied fleet, or red
and black, when the political situation in
the United States Is suddenly strained to
rupture.
A strong red fleet. Including torpedo
boats, sails at 6 p. m., "August 23, from
the port of "K," holding south with the
following sealed orders:
"The red fleet at 'X' will proceed at
once to Portland and seize and hold the
came as a base of operations."
Information of the sailing of the fleet
from "X" is received at Portland four
hours after its departure. The time re
quired for the red fleet to reach Portland
is fifty-four hours. It will be assumed
that prior to the sailing of the red fleet
from "X" no channels are mined or ob
structed. Thereafter all enterprises sanc
tioned by international law are permitted.
It is desirable that the operations of the
fleet Include all channels of approach to
Portland and embrace a reconnoissance
In force and attempt to destroy the mine
fields. There will be day attacks, night
attacks and If practicable the forcing of
the passage.
Preparations will be made to resist at
tacks by forts and by landing parties.
The period of hostility shall 'be from
midnight of August 25 to noon of August
29. The period from midnight. August 23,

Ry the time the work of repairing the
water line was completed Farwell had
been served with an injunction restrain
ing him from interfering with the pipes.
Mrs. Cool in a suit filed has asked for a
permanent injunction against George W.
Hume and Farwell, and also damages.
Mrs. Cool's property carried with It a
water right from a reservoir on the Glen
Una ranch and the water was piped to
her house. This condition existed for a
r.umbfr cf years.
On August 10 James D. Farwell, fore
man cS the Glen Una ranch, tore up the
pipe to Mrs. Cool's residence and stopped
her water supply.
A few days ago Dr. Cool learned of
the matter and Wednesday he came to
Fan Jose and secured a force of plum
bers to repair the pipes. Work was com
menced on the job at midnight and Dr.
Cool and three other men. all armed with
photguns, Ptood guard to 6ee that the
plumbers were not molested. It was not
until ?:33 the next morning that Fore
man Farwell discovered that he had been
outwitted while he slept. Seeing the force
at work on the pipes. Farwell summoned
all the ranch hands and prepared to drive
the â¢workmen from the field. As the Far
well force reached the scene of action
Pr. Cool and hi? armed guards came for
ward. The Elcht of the guns and the
demand cf the doctor that they keep
awav caused Farwell's force to .retire.
PAN JOSE, Aug. 21.â Dispute over a
water right on the Glen Una ranch near
Los Gatoe on Wednesday led to an armed
force being installed by Dr. R. H. Cool,
a 6an Francisco dentist, to prevent dam
age to his property. Mrs. Una H. Cool,
wife of the doctor, owns a piece of about
four acres which is almost surrounded
by the Glen Una ranch. She was for
merly the wife of Frank Hume, now de
teasod. who secured title to the land from
George W. Hume, the owner of the Glen
t'r.a ranch.

COUNTY GIVES BONUS.
According to: the Mining and Scientific
Press the encouragement to be given to
mining companies to build a road in Stan
islaus County from the mines to Westley
and to erect firebrick and tiling factories
at Westley Is a bonus of $12,000. The
combination of mining companies to work
in this direction includes the Martel Com
pany, which ow_ns the Red Mountain dis
trict magriesite "mines; the James Manga
nese Mining Company and the Phosnix
Quicksilver Mining Company, owned by
E. P. Newhall and Alvinza Hayward.
Ten \ new stamps have been put in op

â¢The Sunshine, Coarse Gold, Hillside,
Arthur and University mining claims, at
Bodie.are reported to have been sold to
W. and E. C Provost, who pay $73,000 for
the properties.

The capacity of the De Lamar smelter,
in Shasta County, will be doubled. The
present capacity Is one furnace that turns
out 150 tons of ore per day, or is able to
do that. Preparation has been made by
the Bully Hill Company to treat greater
quantities of ore than formerly were
handled. It is roasting in the open air.
Work on the Blue ' Ledge : copper mine,
in ': Siskiyou County, r near the Oregon
State line, is reported to have been dis
continued.-The reason assigned is that
the development is not good enough con
sidering the price that was asked for the
property. The mine has been under bond
to P. Clark of Spokane for $250.000. ,
According to Siskiyou County . : papers
Development work is proceeding regUT
larly at the Bradford quicksilver mine, in
San Benito County. The depth of 175 feet
has been reached and values in cinnabar
are shown.
The Independence gravel mine, near
Angels, Calaveras County, has been start
ed up and the workmen are sinking tie
shaft. The purpose of the management,
as announced, is to go down to a depth
equal to that of the bedrock of the chan
nel and then drift into the channel. Work
will be resumed on the Fanny Marie and
Bluejay. mines, in Calaveras County.
PROGRESS OF MINING.
A bulletin which will be of great advan
tage to those engaged in seeking informa
tion concerning the many books, pap.ers,
etc., published regarding California mines
and minerals is now in the hands of the
State Printer and will be issued after the
quicksilver bulletin. It will be issued un
der the title of "A Bibliography Relating
to the Geology, Paleontology and Mineral
Resources of California." The statistical
sheet, which is yearly issued by the
bureau, showing the production of the
various minerals mined in the State by
counties, has nearly been completed for
the year 1902. Much care has been exer
cised in the collection of reliable data,
which will give full credit for the min
eral production of California for the past
year. It will be placed in the hands of
the State Printer before September 1. â¢
A collection of oil and oil bearing for
mations for the Mining Bureau and St.
Louis Exposition ia now being made and
commercial analyses of these oils are also
being made. When this work has been
completed the results will be published in
bulletin form and much needed informa
tion regarding California oil will be avail
able. The State Mineralogist is also oc
cupied in making a collection of represen
tative minerals for the St.' Louis Exposi
tion and under his direction assistants are
now scouring the State for exhibit ma
terial.
The field work on the map and register
of Sierra County has been completed and
Is now in the hands of the printer and
will be issued by September 1. As in pre
vious maps and registers Issued, the loca
tion 1 of the various mineral deposits in
the county are shown by number and in
the accompanying register a general de
scription is given. Inserted in the regis
ter is an economic geological map of the
mineralized portions of the county. There
are also tables of elevations of prominent
points, together with descriptions of the
different mining districts. The field work
of the map and register of Tuolumne
County has been completed and they will
be issued during September. The work is
also progressing on the map and register
of Amador County and will be completed
during the present month. The Amador
map and register will probably be issued
by October. The two latter maps and
registers will be compiled similar to that
of Sierra Countv.
Several announcements of interest to
the several mining counties of California
are made by State Mineralogist Aubury.
He says that the field work of the State
Mining Bureau on the bulletin relating
to the quicksilver resources of California
is completed and the manuscript Is now
in the. hands of the State Printer. The
bulletin will probably be readv for dis
tribution about the first of September.
The field covered by this work em
braces a description of all known quick
silver mines and quicksilver prospects in
the State, together with the names of the
owners. Geological maps have been made
of the various districts and underground
maps of many of the prominent mines
are shown, together with cross sections,
where possible to obtain them. The work
is profusely illustrated and contains more
information concerning the quicksilver In
dustry than has ever heretofore been at
tempted. The bulletin is the third of a
series on special subjects which have
been issued under Mr. Aubury's direction.
It has been his aim to fully cover the
field of California minerals in as complete
a manner as possible and to present the
same so that Information of a practical
benefit to the miner and investor will
be obtainable.
TO ADVERTISE RESOURCES.
The Mining and Scientific Press, always
a consistent advocate of the establishment
of the proposed department of mines,
says In a leading- editorial:
Iri this movement the Black Hills Mining
Men's Association Is taking an active part,
and a great deal is expected from this meet
ing 1 of the congress, the primary object of which
was to Influence, as far as possible, the creation
of a national Department of Mines and the ap
pointment of a cabinet officer to represent the
department. The Mining and Scientific Press
has repeatedly pointed out the desirability of
having a Department of Mines created, but
thus far no positive steps have been 'taken by
Congress in this direction. It is to be hoped
that the American Mining Congress may even
tually wield sufficient influence ftt Washing
ton to bring- about the desired end.
The events of the last, year on the
Pacific Coast have been sufficient to dem
onstrate the necessity for fostering the
mines. A controversy of grave import
ance has arisen because of the acts of
timber locators, working either for them
selves or getting in line. to sell out to
millionaires that are on the watch to
get the lands secured through dummy
locators. Yet when thÂ« situation became
sufficiently grave to make it necessary to
memorialize the national administration
at Washington the best thing that could
be done for the miners was to institute
an investigation Into the facts as set up
by the California memorialists, and this
Investigation is supposed to be still in
progress, under the direction of the land
department, which has many interests to
care for. The miners are simply plead
ers In a matter where, by right, they
should have a department devoted to
their interests or at least caring for their
interests and ready to take up their case.
Once more . a national body of repre
sentative mining men is about to \ urge
the establishing of a national department
of mines. This matter is of such great
consequence to all .miners that the forth
coming proceedings will attract much at
tention. The American Mining Congress
will open its deliberations at Dead wood,
S. D., on September 7, and will be In
session until September 12, inclusive.
There will be a large number of tech
nical papers to be read and discussed
more or less and resolutions will be adopt
ed on various subjects, but the topic of
leading concern to the mining fraternity
at large undoubtedly refers to the ap
pointment of a cabinet officer who shall
safeguard the mining interests of the
country. JÂ»*

There is to be a fight in the courts over
the extradition of Julius Jorgensen. the
alleged absconding Danish bank^ clerk,
who has been held a prisoner in the coun
ty Jail here for the last four months.
Judge Henry A. Melvin to-day issued a
v.rit of habeas corpus returnable to-mor
row at 10 o'clock on a showing made by
the prisoner's attorney that he Is being
illegally restrained of his liberty.
It is alleged that irregularities that have
crept into the entire proceedings have
vitiated any action that may now be tak
cn and that Jorgensen is entitled to his
liberty. The main point is that a United
States Commissioner ordered Jorgensen
surrendered into the custody of the Dan
ish Government more than sixty days
jigo, but that no requisition has been
made for him within the time specified.
It is claimed that the Danish Government
has lost its right to make the demand
urd that the prisoner is now out of the
jurisdiction of the United States courts.
It was given out yesterday that United
States Marehal Shine and Captain of De
tective? Martin of San Francisco were to
etart for New York City with the prlif;
cr.cr Sunday morning, while if the alle
Â«atloi;E made in the petition can be sup
ported Jorgensen may gain hi* Hberty
through this technicality.

PORTLAND. Or.. Aug. 21.â An Ontario,
Or.', special says: About three weeks ago
a stranger, thought to be a canvasser,
hired a team of a farmer named James
Morrison of Watson, this county, and left
for Jordan Valley. Intending to be absent
two days. Nothing was heard of the man
or team until yesterday, when one of the
horses 'came home with the harness on.
Investigation proved that the strangtr
had been killed. While on his return trip
and when within five miles of Morrison's
place his wagon , was upset on a steep
hill. The driver was fatally injured and
he crawled to the side of the road, where
he died from his injuries. His body was
found in a clump of bushes. No papers
were found on his body whereby to estab

TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 21.â One of the
greatest land rushes ever known in the
Northwest occurred to-day at Coeur
d'Alene, Idaho, where filings were ac
cepted for the first^time on the Coeur
d'Alene Indian reservation and the newly
surveyed land just thrown open for settle
ment. Nearly 500 men and womeh
were lined up in front of the United
Stales Land Office when it opened for
business at 9 o'clock this morning. â¢ Most
of them had been waiting In line for
forty-eight hours. Susan Pierce, aged 23,
headed the crowd and was the first one
to file. She had remained at the door of
the land office for three days and nights,
thereby securing one of the most val
uable claims In Idaho.
The lands thrown open comprise good
farming property/together with a large
strip of country which is highly mineral
ized. Rapid developments will follow
to-day's filings of claims, as many of tho
locators have money with which to make
extensive improvements. Several fights
occurred with land jumpers during the
period of waiting. Last night there were
prospects that a lynching might take
place because one alleged claim jumper
insisted on getting into line and filing.
Several men were run out of the lobby
of the. land office under threats by home
steaders that they would never be al
lowed to file. Everything proceeded qui
etly to-day, the determination of the
original locators preventing the filing of
adverse claims by jumpers.

Detectives employed by the family to

he left the city.
The Chier of Police has received a let

his wife is losing her mind over his dis
appearance. The family has offered a re

During all this informality no member
of the faculty was on the ground, Pro
fessor Cory, chairman of the students'
affairs committee, has no statement to
make on the conduct of the men to-day,
but an investigation will be inaugurated.
The organization of the freshman class
at the University of California this morn
ing was the occasion of one of the old
time clashes that were popularly supposed
to have passed into tradition when three
men were compelled to sever their con
nections with the university last term
for taking part in rushes. The older
classmen, who are regarded as experts on
the game, 3ay that this morning's little
Btruggle in the old gymnasium was quite
the finest thing they had seen in this par
ticular line since the present seniors en
tered the university in 1900.
The occasion of the little informality
between the students this morning was
the same as the cause that has inspired
sophomores from the earliest traditions
of the university to prevent the freshmen
from organizing their class. To-day they
were eminently successful, as they
stormed fntfdoor to the Harmon Gymna
sium and turned lines of fire hose on the
men "of the baby class who were listening
to their chosen orators on the inside. The
sophomores, fifty strong, formed a wedge
and threw themselves against the door of
the gymnasium time after time in perfect
unison. The door had been considerably
strengthened since the historic assault of
1900 and it was able to withstand the ter
rible onslaught with half a hundred fresh
men on the inside lending it their physical
support.
It remained for one bright mind in the
sophomore class to think out another and
a more 'successful scheme of attack. A
door of lighter construction on the south
Bide was forced and with the an- of a line
of fire hose the second-year, men were
able to produce a startling effect upon the
freshmen. In fact, the advent of the wa
ter made things so interesting and caused
such an uproar that no one has since
been able to find out who was elected to
office. \~>T't 'Â¦Â¦'

The .suit was .contested by the other
heirs, they being satisfied with tne dis
position of the property. Mrs. Barron
was represented by Bishop, Wh'celer &
Hoeffler, and her brothers and sister by
Lloyd & Wood.
Stanton left a fortune valued at many
hundred thousand dollars. He devised it
to his five children, John T., Frank J.
and William "W. Stanton, . Catherine T.
Buckley and Mary F. Barron, share and
share alike, providing, however, that the
Kearny and Mission street realty should
be held in trust by his executors (his
three sons) for their children and the
children of the other heirs. During the
existence of the trust the heirs, that is,
the five children of the deceased, were to
enjoy the income therefrom. Mrs. Barron
was the only one of the children dissatis
fied with the terms of her father's will,
and within a year after his death she
commenced the action which resulted yes
terday in the decision declaring her to be
the absolute owner of a one-fifth interest
in the realty. .
I
Judge Troutt rendered a decision yes*
terday In the suit brought by Mary F.
Barron, daughter of the late James Stan
ton, the pioneer capitalist, who died in
October, 1901, against John A., Frank J.
and William. W. Stanton, her brothers, as
executors of Stanton's will.
He held invalid the trust clause that
bequeathed to the executors as trustees
for the children property on Post and
Kearny streets and Mission and Fif
teenth, and ordered judgment entered as
prayed for by the plaintiff. The trust
clause was fought on the ground that it
gave the children of deceased a life in
terest in the estate, and that it was null
and void because it overlooked . their
rights in the premises by directing that
it should go to their children upon the
death of the last surviving child of the
testator.

SAN DIEGO. Aug. 21.â San Dieco has
had her first cyclone, but It came at the
extreme eastern edge of the county, on
the banks of the Colorado River, and
mere- than two hundied miles from tha
city which boasts so much of its climate.
The little mining town of Plcacho, sorna
thirty miles above Yuma, and without
any communication by telegraph or tele
phone with the outside world, was caught
on Thursday afternoon and lost her
schoolhouse, the Picacho Mining Com
pany's store, the superintendent's resi
dence, several pretentious residences and
a large number of miners' cabins.
The news that came out was directed to
County Superintendent Baldwin, whose
aid was requested by J. C. Mendenhall.
the clerk of the Board of Trustees, who
did not know what to do since their
schoolhouse had gone down In the wind
and there was no proper place for hold
ing school, which was scheduled to begin
on Monday.
The mining camp Is located in a little
valley and the winds sweep down from
the sides of the mountains at a lively
rate at all times. This week has been
fearfully hot on the desert, and that un
doubtedly had much to do with the un
expected visitation. The larger build
ings destroyed were adobe and some of
the walls were very heavy. The superin
tendent's house is only a mile from the
schoolhouse and the store Is oft a little
to the right. That no casualties are men
tioned is taken to indicate that the peo
ple had plenty of warning and wero able
to get out of the way. The wind was
accompanied by rain, and that added to
the destruction.

It goes on to Etate "that if the defend
ant has passed the prime of life and now
finds it necessary to make provision for
his old age that he has come to such
conclusion rather late in life, and that if
V-e had not lived an idle life in. the past
he would not now be illustrating that
*men must reap the things they sow.' "
There is a taunt for his age In which it
if said ""that he fs now in the 'sere and
yellow .leaf and wants the honorable
court to relieve him of the burden of pro
viding for the necessities of his own flesh
and blood."
In the statement of her finances Mrs.
ieo'j'.e says that while entitled to a sixth
of her father's estate, owing to a fire
most of the property is unproductive and
that she needs the $75 a month to clothe
and feed their son I>ouglaR, now 13 years
cf age. Â¦
The petition of Professor Frank Soule
U> be relieved of the burden of paying $75
a month alimony to his, former wife, Mrs.
Ella Bacon Soule, who is alleged to be
worth S223.OOJ in her own right., has
brought forth an answer full of bitter
ness for the popular college professor.
When Mrs. So'jle was given a decree of
-.'.ivorce from the professor, by stipula
tion it was agreed that he should pay
her S75 a month alimony. Since then she
has. fallen heir to a six\h of the estate of
her father, which was appraised at 5SS0,
uOO, acd is alleged to be worth $1,250,000.'
Soule remarried, and the payment of the
.-75 a month was a heavy drain on "his
t-ulury, arid some time ago he petitioned
the court to so modify the decree as to
relieve him of the necessity of paying
ti.is money.
In an answer filed to-day by Lloyd &
Wood cf San Francisco in behalf of their
client they denote a paragraph of un
pleasantness to reading him a lecture on
his position. It is stated that "it is
through no fault of hers that his new
r.iresElties are such as to cause him per
trinal inconvenience," and that these con
ditions were existing at the time he mar
ried a second time.

DECLARES TRUST
CLAUSE INVALID
The neighbors In the immediate vicinity
of where the burglary occurred are of the
belief that the burglar is a peddler, who
has been hanging around for several days.
He first entered the sleeping apartments
of Mr. and Mrs. Gertz and chloroformed
them. He then went to the rooms occu
pied by their sons, .William, Emmet and
Otto, and administered enough of the
sleep producer to protect himself from in
terference at their hands. Having chlo
roformed" the entire household, the bur
glar began to search the apartments.
He was heard by William, the elder of
the boys, and also by Mr. and Mrs. Gertz
when he entered their room the last time.
The darkness was too dense for them to
see his features or to note his general
appearance. They were cognizant of his
presence, but were unable to move. None
of the family knew just when the burglar
left the house, but Gertz believes that he
saw him pass out, going through the
front door and down the steps to Fremont
street. The stupor under which Gertz
was laboring was so great that he was
unable to collect himself and defend' his
home from the pilfering of the daring
burglar. The same was true of Mrs.
Gertz. It was fully an hour after the
burglar left the house before Gertz had
recovered sufficiently to notify the po
lice. Mrs. Gertz had a severe headache
to-day; but aside from that none of the
family suffered from the effects of the
drug. S^i
PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 21â A daring bur
glar chloroformed a family of five at 4
o'clock this morning, robbed the house at
his leisure and escaped with considerable
Jewelry and $2 80 in cash. The members
of the family of Mr. and Mrs. H. C.
Gertz of 410 Fremont street were the vic
tims. They heard the burglar and knew
that he was operating in their midst, but
were so stupefied by the drug which had
been administered to them that they were
unable to rise or to cry out for help. Be
fore entering the Gertz home the burglar
tried to rob the, residence of Mr. and Mrs.
Pierce of 724 Union avenue, but was put
to flight before he had an opportunity to
administer the chloroform. It is thought
that he went direct from there to the
Gertz house.

Lieutenant J. M. Mllliken, with Com
panies G and I, was ordered to move east
at 7:30 this morning to take up a defen
sive position and to protect his men from
capture. Lieutenant Colonel Forbes, in
command of the remaining men of the
regiment, left an hour later. The men
who were defending wore blue shirts and
the attacking men Khaki uniforms.
Colonel Forbes and men fell in. line at
8:30 and marched across the cut bias
bridge around the road that leads to
Seabrlght. Lieutenant Martin with a
squad of skirmishers and Lieutenant
Cannon of Company E with another
squad were sent ah%ad to locate the
enemy. Every shed and barn around Sea
bright was searched by the scouts. After
finding the road clear, a elgnal was given
and Colonel Forbes and men proceeded
on the march. The enemy had entrenched
themselves on the east side of the woods.
One-third of them were at the east end
of the railroad trestle and the others
were I behind the Capitola railway em
bankment. the enemy was located
sharp shooters were placed among the
trees which fringe the bank and then the
main body of troops arrived.
Lieutenant Martin was on the extreme
left and attempted to cross the trestle,
but his attempt to capture the men who
wore guarding it was unsuccessful, and
he and his nineteen men were shot lo
pieces, "according to decision of j the
umpires."
Colonel Forbes crawled to the. edge of
the bluff on the grass and brought up
the reserves, the Nevada City company.
The men crawled*to the edge of the bluff
under. a lively fire. Under cover of this
fire Major Greer took his command down
a cut In the bluff. Major Greer ordered
the men forward at double time and
gained the embankment. Jn the mean
time the reserves kept up a steady flre.
After engaging in close firing another
platoon crossed the bridge and attacked
on the flank. Both sides claim a victory.
Hereafter in National Guard hl3tory the
engagement will be known as the battle
ct Twin Lakes. Companies participating
were from Sacramento, Nevada City,
Grass Valley, Marysville, Chico and
Woodland. The scene of the battle was
nearly three miles from Camp Stone. The
officers say . it was the most successful
battle'the regiment ever engaged in.
SANTA CRUZ, Aug:. 21.â So near real
ism did the sham battle of the^Second
Regiment become to-day that Colonel Sey
mour and Major Perky, the umpires, had
to give the order, "Cease firing." The
men became aa excited as though In real
warfare. An Immense crowd of specta
tors saw the battle, in which the popping
of g-uns and the rattle of musketry
played a prominent part. The lay of the
land, the strong defensive position of the
enemy and the rapid maneuvers of the
attacking party made It Interesting. Who
the victors were was not. decided.

During the struggle to cut loose the
sails and in the dangerous employment
of jettisoning cargo in a heavy sea sev
eral members of the crew were pretty
severely knocked about, but all the
bruises had healed by yesterday when
the ship passed In through the Golden
Gate.
In a southeasterly hurricane encoun
tered Marc- 22 tne Ben Lee was thrown
on her beam ends again and once more
shifted her careo.
The Ben I>ee sti'-l wears the scars of
those battles of five months ago. Her
head rails, are twisted and- patches and
makeshifts are In e%"idence from forecas
tle head to poop. She is tight as a drum,
however, and, although in need of nu
merous miscellaneous repairs, is just as
good a ship as when she left Hamburg. -
TixE British ship Ben Lee, which
arrived yesterday 193 days from
Hamburg, encountered two ter
rific hurricanes In the early part
of the voyage. The ship was
thrown on her beam ends, the cargo
shifted and only the stanchness of the
vessel and stoutness of her sticks saved
the Ben Lee from 'enuing her voyage be
fore she had fairly started from the old
world. The first and worst of the hurri
canes was encountered February 22 off
the north coast of Scotland. The wind,
from the southwest, increased in violence
until it blew a hurricane -force. One
blast, fiercer than those that : had been
whistling by for hours, laid the heavily
laden ship on her beam ends. While ly
ing at a sharp angle to starboard the
cargo shifted. Some sails blew away.
Such canvas aa remained - added to the
peril of the almost capsized ship, and
Captain Anderson called for volunteers to
go aloft and cut away the sails still stand
ing!" :'.Â£-;Â¦;Â¦
Every man offered his services. Those
selected succeeded in cutting loose the
sails and relieving the pressure that
threatened to send the vessel to the bot
tom. Freed from the weight of the wind's
force on the canvas, the Ben Lee partly
rightea herself, but not until 500 barrels
of cement had been thrown overboard
did she resume anything like an eyen
keel.

irurdered in his store there last night

SALT LAKE, Aug. 21.â There are now
two parties of surveyors for the Western
Pacitic working on the main line of the
road that is to connect Salt Lake and San
Francisco. Word has been received that
the party that started out from Salt
I-ake some weeks ago Is now in Nevada
heading to meet the other party coming
East. It is stated that the prellmir.p>
survey will be completed within the r^ct
plxty days. The main line, it is said.^.ill
po arrtur.d the south end of the lakjvia
Garfteld. In addition a branch rc#i to
tap the Deep Creek district, if njf. the
main line itself, is being figured om.
From a reliable source it is learned that
orders have gone forth from headquarters
to rush things all along the line. Several
local draughtsmen have been approached
with the object in view of securing their
cervices for the line through to the coast.
"The policy being followed by Mr.
Gould is to develop and perfect the prop
erties 'already owned, and the extension
*-ork that is now being done Is mainly
taking place In the East. We expect to
be operating into Pittsburg by the end
or the year."
â¢â¢At present we have no plans for ex
tending the Gould roads to the Pacific
Coast," said Mr. Bird. "What future de
velopments may bring forth I cannot tell.
I 4o not know anything about the West
ern Pacific or who are behind it, and am
not familiar with their plans.
DENVER. Aug. 21.â A. C. Bird, vice
president of all the Gould roads. In charge
cf ttte traffic, arrived in Denver to-day.
In an interview he stated that plans for
consolidating the Missouri Pacific and the
Denver and Rio Grande had not been con
sidered. *

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Prices of river Potatoes were unchanged and
the markt-t was moderately active under a lim
ited demand for shipping and a good local in
quiry. Five CP.rs of Salinas Burbanks were
marketed and fancy offerings met with quick
sale at steady rates. Merced Sweet Potatoes
were offering again and sold at the minimum
quotation. The top rate was obtained for
choice offerings from Stockton. Onions were
weak, with stocks steadily accumulating. Only
strictly fancy offerings sold over ur>c per ctl.
Most description* of vegetables were In ex
cessive supply, and, as trade was quiet, prices
generally had a downward tendency. Receipts
cf Green Corn were heavy and included much
poor stock, some of which had to be dumped.
There was practically no Inquiry for String
.or Wax Beans*, which were In free supply. The I
canners were offering one cent per lb for choice
String and secured a considerable quantity.
Tomatoes were in light but ample supply and
continued to command good figures. Green Pep
pers and Okra were abundant and very weak.
The other vegetables were unchanged.

Poultry and Game.
% Poultry ruled easy under continued heavy
receipts, but prices had.no quotable change.
A car of Western was on sale and sold In pref

which was not wanted. Large old Roosters
and heavy Hens were steady, but Fryers. Broil

weak at previous prices. A considerable por

NEW YORK. Aug. 21. â The lessening range
of fluctuations in to-day's stock market. Its
irregular tone and the diminishing volume of
businfFs all indicated pretty clearly the ap
i prcjach of another period of speculative rest,
which iÂ» likely to mean email trading and
sluggish fluctuations until some marked change
in condition* develop?. The rally which de
veloped yenterday afternoon was carried for
ward this morning to the extent of between
one and two points for the active stocks. The
rtlly was apparently directed against the
cherts and was effective In Inducing them to
cover largely. Thia served as an admonition
to tbe bears that forces existed to oppose their
effort* to force prices lower, juxt aa the reac
tion on Tuesday had a warning effect on the
over- Industrious bulls. A comparison of prices
of twenty active railroad stocks Indicates that
the decline on the average in prices from the
hlRh level of 1902 to the low level in the early
part of the present month reached something
over 45 points. The only substantial Inter
vening rally was In the latter part of last
year nnd the firt-t part of this under the in
fluence of what Wall street has come to name
â¢ he "faith cure." consisting in intimations
from an influential party of bank officials last
fall, when bank reserves were falling, that they
rtood prepared to supply $50,000,000 of credits
to the stork market If necessary to avert
trouble. That measure postiwned the process
of liquidation, but did not avert It. and It Is
evident that tbe course the market has run
nince had its Inception previous to that. The
rally in the average price of the same twenty
stocks up to the culmination of Tuesday ie
?^itlmated p.t II !x>Int*. The reaction of yes
terday's low point wag In the neighborhood
of TÂ» poiiits. and to-day's upward movement
did not avail to overcome that. ThÂ»Â» approach
toward a condition of more stable equilibrium
Is easily perceptible. The early demand to-day
did not go far beyond the uncovered short
Interest. The actual weakness developed by :
the fnitrd State* Realty stocks was a factor
In checking the advance, but it was not ef
fectively renewed after the Realty stocks ral
lied. The day's weather map was reported per
fect for the growing crops, and wheat and
corn eased cfl In consequence.
Coprer was rtrong In London and sentiment
abroad was more cheerful regarding the no- i
litical outlook for Southeastern Europe. The
weekV ircHpts of Australian gold and the fact
that the currency movement at the Interior is
â¢till in favor of New York on balance
premise" well for to-morrow's bank statement,
although the usual doubts cloud the loan Item.
Thepe new developments did not avail to hold
the market. Weakness became decided in the
1'nltrd States 8teel Ftooks and in Pennsylvania,
and quite a number of the leading active stocks
wer<* forced a point or more under last night's
level. A final rally aocentuatfd th<Â» irregular
character of the Â¦ market and the closing
was firm. , . .- ". Â¦ : -' Â¦ -
llonds wore Irregular. Total sales (par

United States bonds were unchanged on call.

very little inquiry for. shipping. There was
very little, business reported In bulk Fruit, as

Â«nd Peachea were steady, j but common and In
ferior offerings were abundant and weak. The
demand for Apples was confined chiefly to
fancy Gravenstelns In four-tier boxes and
there was practically no . Inquiry for lower
grade offerings Plums and Grapes were In
free supply and eaBy. the demand for shipping
being light. Figs arrived freely and sold at
Irregular prices as to variety and size of pack
age. Nectarines. were In fair request and as

were additional receipts of Pomegranates, all

Â©83c per box. The market was overstocked
with Cantaloupes and Nutmeg Melons and

poor and soft, hence the wide range In prices.

And henceforth in our patrons' ranks you'll march as a recruit.Captain Armstrong of the Ottawa In
dian Agency was in a reminiscent mood
the other day and told the following story
on a well-known minister in that country.
Back in the early days in the agency he
had married a couple, and after a short
time the woman died. The man hustled
around and prevailed upon another wom
an to take the place made vacant by the
death, of wife No. 1, and they immediately
proceeded to hunt up a minister. Heavy
rains had fallen and the streams were
past fording. As the minister lived on the
opposite side of the creek from them, they
drove to its banks and hollered tiU he
came to the door. They told him what
they wanted and that they could not get
across. The difficulty was soon overcome
by the reverend gentleman saying: "Thee
will join hands where thou art." They did
so and were pronounced husband and
wife. The groom asked what the fee was
and was informed that $1 would pay the
bill. This he took from his pocket and
threw across the turbulent waters and
landed it near the feet of the minister,
who picked It up and asked as he did bo:
"What has become of the former wife to
whom 1 married thee?" "She Is dead."
was the response, "Dost thou know that
thou did. not pay me for thy former mar
riage?" queried the preacher. "That's
true," said the groom, "but I will pay you
now," and suiting his action to the prom
ise, he tossed the minister another dol

We would like to be numbered with the
News and Courier, the Mobile Register
and other of our contemporaries In the
advocacy of having whitÂ© girls for wait
ers In the hotels. The poor service given
at most of our Southern hotels Is a con
stant reproach to us. arid the only rem
edy we can see is to replace the stupid,
clumsy, untidy negro men with intelligent,
sprightly, refined Southern girls.
Those who visited the cafe in the Wom
an's Building at the Charleston Exposi
tion remembered what a pleasure and a
satisfaction it was to be waited on by
neat, attractive, bright, refined young
women.
These girls were from some of 'the
proudest and best families of Charleston,
and when we say that, of course, it
means the proudest and best /families in
the world, for there are none better.
There are certainly none â¢ prouder, and if
Charleston girls will serve it seems that
the girls of other places might also be
induced to serve in this honorable and
highly respectable capacity. â Spartanburgr

At Yale the retiring age is 65, after
twenty-five years of service, on half pay,
but there is no compulsory retirement as
yet. At Columbia the retiring age. after
fifteen years of service, is 65, either at the
request of the professor, or on motion of
the trustees. Retired professors receive
half pay. At Cornell the retiring age is
70, but the pension fund will not bt? avail
able till 1914, when the retiring pension
will be $1500.
Johns Hopkins University and the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania have as yet no
fixed retiring age. The Massachusetts
General Hospital retires surgeons at 63
and physicians at 65. At the Boston City
Hospital the surgeons retire at 65, but
the physicians may continue indefinitely.
Some universities and colleges have insti
tuted a system that gives a professor one
year of rest out of seven. During this
sabbatical year he receives .half pay and
is freed from all college duties. The
United States Naval Academy gives
him full pay during his vacation, but re
quires from him a detailed" report upon
professional subjects connected â¢ with
Questions of military education.
The foregoing is a summary of the prac
tice in a few American colleges. The rea
sons for and against the practice are too
many and too complex to be considered
here. A system that might have rele
gated Professor Sylvester to retirement
would have been a fearful blow to the
progress of mathematics in America. On
the other hand, we all know much
younger teachers who should be sent on
indefinite leaves as soon as possible. At
tempts to establish hard and fast rules
will probably prove to be failuresâ New

It Is well known that the Government
retires Its officers of the n:vy at the age
of 62 years, and Its army officers at the
age of 64. This is not intended as a favor
to the Individual, but is designed for the
gocd of the service. The practice has
been followed by various American col
leges. Harvard University permits a pro
fessor to ask for retirement on a reduced
pay varying: from one-third to two-thirds
of his salary, at the age of 60, provided
that he has already served the institution
for twenty years. At 66 he may be re
tired by the president and fellows' either
partly or wholly. The University of Chi
cago is now arranging for a similar sys
tem. Vj> '-:Â¦

and Fast Rule May

Max Katzauer, proprietor of a cigar
store at Third and Townsend streets, was
held to answer yesterday in $3000 bonds
before the Superior Court on a charge of
receiving stolen goods. He was' charged
with buying, two cases of cigars that had
been stolen April 8 from a Southern Pa
cific car on the way to Yuma, Ariz. The
arrest was made by Special Officer Lewin
of the Southern Pacific and Detective Ser
geant T. L. Ryan. '
A motion to dismiss was argued by At
torney T. P. Rlordan for the defendant
and Attorney Frank Kelly for the prose
cution. Riordan in his argument laid
stress upon the fact that C. C. Crowley,
chief, special officer of the Southern Pa
cific, had seen the stolen cigars in Kat
zauer's store a week before his arrest
and had told him to go on selling them,
but to keep an empty box. The company
claims that a large number of cases of
cigars have been stolen from cars this
year and every effort is being made to
trace the thieves.
Max Katzauer Is Accused of Re
ceiving Cigars Stolen From

Since tbe con%-lctlon of Quon Quock
Wah for the Burder of Tom Tick of the
Chinese Educational Society there have
been rumors cf projected murders in
Chinatown, and one of the prospective
victims is said to be Ching Yuen Law.
Ching Yuen Law Is a native son and a
member of the Suey Sing tong. He was
employed by the nine presidents of tongs
arrested for the murder of Tom Tide to
act as interpreter during the trial of
Quon Quock Wah. Loo Dee, president of
the Suey Don tong, is one of those under
arrest. He owned a beautiful slave girl,
6:ng Gun, who lived at 920 Sacramento
street, and durir.g his incarceration Ching
Yuen Law fell in love with Sing Gun, and
his affection was reciprocated.
On Thursday Ching Yuen Law procured
a marriage license and that night he took
Sing Gun to the Chinese Presbyterian
Mission, on Sacramento street, where
they were married.
As soon ap . the members of the Suey
Don tong learned of the marriage they
held a meeting, and it is said they de
cided upon killing Ching Yuen Law for
the insult offered by him to their presi
dent in stealing and marrying his clave
pirl, who was valued at $2500. The Suey
Sing tong held a meeting yesterday and
decided that if any harm was done to
Ching Yuen Law they would have a life
for a life War Is predicted.
The Bing Kong tong may also be drawn
Ir.to the fight, as a reward of $300 was
offered yesterday for the head of Wong
Fong. one oi its members. He was also
employed as an interpreter by the nine
presidents, and it is claimed that he got
$3000 for a certain purpose which he failed,
to carry Into effect.
The Greeks already mentioned fell into
the hands of the secret service men AP ril
17 of this year. They were indicted' for
conspiring to make counterfeit five and
ten dollar ooins. Agent Hazen learned
that Johnson was known in Seattle as
Harry C. Patrick, where he worked as
a waiter and attempted to get three other
Greeks in that place to engage with him
in counterfeiting. Secret Service Agent
Bell went on the trail and the wily Greek
escaped to San Francisco. He was shad
owed in this city by Agents Moffitt and
Foster under instructions of Agent Ha
zen and his meetings with Triantopolis
and Tsoucas were noted. Patrikioupoulou
was the ringleader and entered Into ne
gotiations with steel engravers to have
the dies cut. When things were ripe each
Greek was /taken into custody, and all
made confession, each blaming the others
for getting him into trouble. Had they
not been prevented by the secret service
men from getting the dies made they
would have flooded the market with very
dangerous counterfeits.
A batch of counterfeiters were brought
before United States District Judge de
Haven yesterday morning to plead to the
indictments against them. George Brown,
alias R. R. Lambert, pleaded guilty of
having counterfeiting tools in his pos
session and was ordered to appear on
Monday for sentence. George Trlanto
polis. alias George Rose, pleaded guilty
of conspiring to manufacture counterfeit
coins. James Tsoucas pleaded not guilty
of the same offense, and Christos Patrlk
ioupoulou, alias Chris Johnson, alias
Harry C. Patrick, was given until Mon
day to plead.
Brown is 60 years of age and very fee
ble. It Is not probable that he will live
to complete the term of imprisonment to
which he will be sentenced on Monday.
He has been a criminal and a jail bird
for fifty years, counterfeiting being his
hobby. In California his record dates
backto 1SS0. when he was sent to the pen
itentiary on a four years' sentence. In
1S91 he began a ten years' sentence of im
prisonment, and in 1S98, soon after hav
ing be-en released, he was sentenced to
five years' imprisonment. He was re
leased in May, 1902. and March 24, 1903.
was arrested In his room at 43S Broadway,
whither he had been shadowed by United
States Secret Service Agents Hazen and
Moffitt. The officers found concealed in
his room a large quantity of molds and
other tools for the manufacture of base
coin. During the past month Brown has
been in the City and County Hospital un
der guard.
United States District Attorney Wood
worth appeared before United States Cir
cuit Judge Morrow and United States
District Judge de Haven yesterday and
induced them to sign the following rule
of court, which will remedy the evil:
Rule in relation to applications for writs
of habeas corpus:
Every petition for the issuance of a writ or
habeas corpus by or on behalf of any person
claiming the right to enter or land in the
United States as a native born citizen thereof
must set forth that the right of such person
to so enter or land has been denied by the
Commissioner of Immigration for the Port of
San Francisco, and there must also be filed
with such petition a duly certified copy of the
eald order or ruling of the Commissioner of
Immigration.
No writ of habeas corpus for the purpose of
determining the right of any person to enter
or land in the United States as a native born
citizens thereof will be Issued unless the fore
going requirements of this rule are complied
with, except when the petition alleges andt It
Is shown to the satisfaction of the court that
ivi examination of the right of such person to
enter the United States has been delayed by
the proper officer for an unreasonable length
of time, in which case the petition shall set
forth the facts showing such delay. â¢ .

San Francisco. Aug. 21, 1903.
A check was provided yesterday
through the efforts of United States Dis
trict Attorney "Woodworth against the
schemes of brokers engaged in landing
Chinese that fraudulently claim to be na
tives of the United States. It has been
customary among this class of schemers
to apply for writs of habeas corpus for
their clients, alleging that they are citi
zens of the United States and are being
held in custody illegally by the steamship
officials. When the applications for the
writs are granted the Chinese immigrant
is taken by the United States Marshal
to the County Jail, there to await his ex
amination. While there his friends coach
him on the story they wish him to tell in
order to secure his admission to this
country. This is done before the officials
of the Chinese Bureau have had an op
portunity of taking the immigrant's state
ment on board the ship and the state
ment often contradicts those of the wit
nesses on shore.
Becker describes the men as follows:
One five feet ten inches tall, weight about
150 pounds, 24 years of age, clean shaven
and wearing a light overcoat; the other
five feet seven inches tall, weight 145
pounds, 28 years of age, with a mustache
and wearing a sack suit. Detectives Gra
ham and Fitzgerald have been detailed
on the case.
Becker walked up to them and asked
them what they were doing there a"nd the
taller of theV two replied that they were
v.aiting for the Mission owl car. The
burglar had his right hand in his over
coat pocket and Becker heard something
jingle in his pocket. He stretched out
his hand to feel what was in the pocket
when the burglar quickly drew a revolver
and fired a shot at Becker, who promptly
drew Jiis revolver and returned the fire.
The burglar started to run away and his
companion opened fire upon Becker and
also started to run. Becker gave chase
down Eighteenth street to Guerrero,
along Guerrero to Dorland and along Dor
land to Dolores, where he lost sight of
them. Becker fired three shots, but does
not know how many were fired at him.
At Seventeenth street Becker met Ser
geant Blank and Policeman F. Smith, but
they had not seen any men running in
that direction. They searched the local
ity thoroughly, but could find no trace
of the desperadoes. They went to the
scene of the shooting and found in front
of Hoegeman's saloon a large sized "jim
my." Sergeant Blank extracted a 44
caiiber bullet from a telegraph pole near
the saloon.
Two burglars and Policeman Louis J.
Becker had a running gun fight out in
the Mission early yesterday morning and
although several shots were fired none of
the bullets took effect. The burglars,
after being chased for several blocks,
succeeded in making their escape.
Becker was patrolling his beat on Guer
rero street shortly before 4 o'clock yes
terday morning and observed two men
coming from the direction of Nineteenth
street. * They turned up Eighteenth street
and he fololwed them. He saw them
standing in the doorway of Julius Hoege
man's, saloon and when they noticed him
they stepped out of the doorway.
Suits for divorce were also filed by
Margaret McKinnon against Thomas Mc-
Kinnon for cruelty, James F. Gibbons
against Sarah I. Gibbons for cruelty, and
Olga Kroeger against J. C. Kroeger for
desertion.
Suits for divorce were filed by Nettle B.
Craig against Cyrus O. Craig and ChriaÂ«,
tian Gerniuiller against Julius John Ger
muiller. Mrs. Craig, who was married at
Warren, Minn., three years ago and who
has one child, charges neglect and ask's
for $30 a month alimony. Mrs. Germulller
charges desertion, alleging that her hus
band abandoned her more than a year
ago. C
Chief Emergency Surgeon Edwin Bun
nell was granted a divorce for desertion
from Mary R. Bunnell by Judge Kerrigan.
It was provided by stipulation that the
two children of the couple should remain
in the custody of Mrs. Bunnell and that
the doctor should pay her $50 a month for
their support and education. It was also
provided that a further sum of $50 a
month should be paid Mrs. Bunnell by her
former husband for her own support, this
to remain in effect for the rest of her
natural life, provided she doea not marry
again.
Judge Graham made an order giving
Ferdinand . L. Ramon permission to visit
his child, who is In the custody of his di
vorced wife, on every other Sunday and
as often as he likes on week days. The
order was made, on complaint of Ramon,
who claimed that Mrs. Ramon insulted
him when he made the visits. The whole
Ramon family, as well as the relatives
of Mrs. Ramon, were in court during the
proceedings and made it a lively session
by air striving to talk at once.
Judge Graham granted W. F. Becker a
divorce from Mae Becker on the ground
of habitual intemperance.
Captain Going's testimony was that he
was married at Yokohama , in October,
1895. He lived there with his wife until
September, '1901, when he came to this
city and took up his residence. His wife
refused to accompany him and in re
sponse to one of his letters requesting
her to Join him here wrote and curtly in
formed him that she would not live In
California. His evidence was corrobo
rated by that of Bemiss and Kelsey and
they both testified that they were posi
tive the Goings had not lived together
since September, 1901.
} Philip Going, captain of the steamship
America /Maru, was granted a divorce
*rom Mary Going for desertion by Judge
Murasky yesterday. The testimony was
taken by a commissioner and was fur
nished by Captain Going and L. E.
Bemiss and N. E. Kelsey, respectively

intense pain low in the abdomen

had a heavy, depressed feeling
which made my work seem twice

The medicine the doctor gave me
did not do me one bit of good, and
I was thoroughly discouraged. The
doctor wanted me to stop work, but,
of course, I could not do that. I
finally began to take Lydia E.
