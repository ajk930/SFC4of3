GERMAN KAISER UNDERGOES
OPERATION FOR REMOVAL OF
A GROWTH ON THE LARYNX
VtEW YORK, Nov. 8.â Dr.
jf \ Peter J. Gibbons, the well
known throat specialist of
this city, when shown the cable
dispatches telling: of the opera
tion on the - Kaiser, ' said Â¦ to
night: "A polypus is a small
tumor which may occur on any
mucous membrane, most fre
quently Â¦ in the nasal cavities.
: In substance ; it is soft, spongy
and gelatinous, resembling the
structure and formation of an
oyster. As 1 to its being consid
ered innocent, no growth or sore
in the throat can be regarded as
such, for the most benign or in
nocent growths niay become the
most malignant and cancerous
nature in time. This is true
especially in that part of > the
throat where the growth was
found.
"If this growth is as simple
as ascribed by the surgeons,
time only will prove if it is ma
lignant. â¢Â¦ - It will assert "itself
within eighteen ! months. While
a polypus; speaking generally,
should ;' not of itself cause any
great^ alarm," yet in\ the case of
the\German Emperor, -when his
family"' history is \into
consideration, there is j cause for
some apprehensibn. If you re
member,? in .the case ) of Presi
dent Grant/; the ; growth . vtm at
first considered - of a harmless
nature,- but^it â¢ turned^ out later
-toibe a cancer.
"I infer â¢ from the \ cable} dis
patches 'that the surgeons in* at-^
tendance* are suspicious that the
rgrowth'is'or will ; become malig-,
nantjifor they have taken every
precaution _ to ascertain Â¦ its ; ex
act nature.'-' v :

succeeded the late Professor Vlrchow in
the chair of pathological anatomy In the
University of Berlin. Professor Orth made
a microscopical examination, which shows
that the polypus consisted of a very soft
connective tissue,' containing very few
cells. This tissue was covered all overby
a scaly epithelium, sharply^ defined \ from
the tissue. A portion of the connective tis
sue cells contained fine brown, plgmented
granules, which evidently were the result
of former slight hemorrhages. ' : The
polypus also contained a number of thin

but showed the effects of their hardship.
The Titania should arrive at San Fran
cisco to-morrow.
The Nelson's deckload appears, from
the statements of the rescued crew, to
have been responsible for the loss of the
vessel. The stanchions soon pulled out
after the vessel ran into the storm and
the deck was torn up in places. The seas
which swept over the steamer soon filled
her and'rendered her helpless. â¢; ..
All the vessels arriving yesterday and
to-day report . extremely heavy weather
off the coast, and it is believed further
maritime mishaps have occurred.
CREW WORKS HEROICALLY.
Speaking of the abandonment of the
Nelson, one of the officers of the Sea
Rover said:
"I am convinced that the loss of tho
Nelson can be attributed solely to the
Immense deckload which she carried. A
terrific gale was blowing and the sea3
were running as I have never seen them
before, and I have traveled up and down
this coast for many years. In such a
storm it Is almost impossible to prevent
a deckload such as the Nelson carried
from 'working,' as mariners call It, and
the Nelson's load proved to be no excep
tion to the rule. Her crew worked heroic
ally, but with such a eea on it was im
possible to prevent the load from slipping,
and first one stanchion was torn out and
then another.
"The deck seams opened and the water
poured Into her hold, washing about be
tween decks and rendering the steamer
all the more difficult to handle In a boil
ing sea. She was becoming water-logged
rapidly and finally the commander of the
Nelson gathered his passengers and the
crew about him and told them to prepare
to take to the boats. The calm demeanor
of the captain instilled, hope and con
fidence in the passengers and crew and
the preparations for abandoning the ves
sel were carried on coolly iand systematic-,
ally, with the result that when ' every
thing was ready, the passengers were' first
placed in the boats and the crew followed.'
The boats 'were cut loose from the
steamer and -the crew manned ! the oars,

sufferings of the shipwrecked persons
were terrible. The storm did not decrease
during the night and daybreak found the
boats, which had kept closely together all
night, out of sight of land and not a ves
sel to be seen. All during Friday and
during the night the unfortunates kept
watch for a friendly sail or the smoke of
a steamer, but not one appeared to raise
the hopes of the party. Hope was rapidly
deserting them when we sighted the boats
and bore down .upon them. It was with
great difficulty that we got them aboard
our vessel. Not long after the Titania
was sighted, and the passengers, who
numbered nine, and the Nelson's crew,
were transferred to her and taken to San
Francisco." .
The steamer Charles W. Nelson was
built at the yards of Hay & Wright in
Alameda, CaL, in 1893, and was christened
in honor of her owner. She was a stanch
schooner-tigged craft of 1057 tons gross
and 802 tons net register. Her dimen
sions were: Length, 196 feet; beam, 37.8
feet; depth of hold 12.8 feet. She was
built for the coasting trade and since
completion had run on nearly every route
from. San Francisco north and had also
made a number of trips to Alaska. On
her last inward voyage she brought a
general cargo from San Francisco to
Frank Woolsey & Co. and loaded back
with lumber from Westport. She had

CHEYENNE, Wyo., Nov. 8.âTo-mor
row Is the day set for the walkout of the
coal miners of District' No. 5, but so far
as the mines of Wyoming are concerned
very few men will quit work. There are
only a few j union miners scattered
throughout the State, but even, if 'they
all go out it will not affect the mines in
the least. Efforts were made some time
ago to organize the miners of Wyoming,
but it proved a signal failure.*
Few Will Strike in Wyoming.
General Pompilio Guiterrez, one of the
Colombian leaders who arrived at Colon
just about the time the revolution oc
curred, had orders to execute forty-seven
Nationalists, including Dr. Manuel Ama
dor, who is Minister of Finance of the
new Government; Jose A. Arango, Tomas
Arias and Federlco Boyd, the triumvirs
who are governing the republic; General
Huerta3, Carlos Mendcza, who Is now
Minister of Justice, and Senor Zubieta.
General Guiterrez was made a prisoner
upon arriving at Colon and was sent to
Cartagena with the Colombian troops
which were occupying the city.
The de facto Government has the per
fect confidence of the people and there
is great enthusiasm over the success of
the coup d'etat. The new Congress will
meet next week.
The gunboat Pad ilia, belonging to the
new Government, started from Panama
to-night to search for the Colombian gun
boat Bogota. The United States cruiser
Boston has arrived in Panama.
COLON, Nov. S.â Senor Porflrio s Me
lendez, the newly appointed Governor of
Colon, has received the congratulations of
the communitv.
Guiterrez Had Orders to, Execute the
Leaders in Panama.
SCORES MASKED FOB DEATH.
At Superior 100 men struck, while at
Marshall nearly 200 men are out. . At
Mitchell fifty men employed at the Joe
Mitchell have Joined the strike. This
makes the shut-down practically com
plete and only a few of the small inde
pendent mines will open to-morrow morn
ing.
The action of the miners of the northern
field was a surprise to the operators. Af
ter the conference held In this city in
which practically every demand except
the eight-hour day was granted to the
men, they determined to strike.
DENVER, Nov. 8.â A general strike in
the Northern Colorado coal field was de
clared at Louisville to-day. In all about
1725 men are idle or will be to-morrow
morning. At Louisville BOO men in the
Rex 1, Rex 2 and Hecla voted to go out.
At Lafayette 850 struck on .the Simpson,
fifty on the Garfleld and seventy-five on
the Mitchell. At Erie 400 men struck,
tying up all the mines except the Blue
Ribbon.
Men in Northern Fields Go Out De
spite Concessions Granted.
TTE-TJP ALMOST COMPUETE,
After a brief silence there were loud
cries of "Long live Plus." Then a cho
rus of clear voiced girls sang a hymn to
the Pope. As soon as this hymn was fin
ished another was begun by a chorus of
boy students. Including pupils from the
American college, led by Vice Rector
Murphy of New York.*
The Pope spoke for fifteen minutes. His
concluding words were:
"Times are evil, but the evil can be
cured by prayer." -
His Holiness 'imparted the apostolic
benediction to the ' gathering. Several
persons, including Booth Tarklngton, the
novelist, and Mrs. Tarkington and Mr.
and Mrs. Abel of Baltimore, were then
permitted to kiss his hand.
ROME, Nov. 8.â Pope Pius X this after
noon held another of the receptions begun
by him this autumn that the people .of
Rome might have his blessing. At an
early hour the large court of San Damas
was so full that not another person could
be squeezed in. It, Is, believed that there
were about 20,000 persons in the court and
many were turned away, while Raphael's
loggia was full to overflowing. The ap
pearance of the Pope was made amid
great pomp. Preceded by. guards and
surrounded by the prelates' of the court,
he took his position on the throne under
the clock, facing the entrance. As he
came in a * tremor of emotion was per
ceptible in the vast crowd, the present
generation being unaccustomed to any
public, view of a Pope. His Holiness
was visibly touched and hla eyes filled
with tears.
There is not one mine in this section
that can start up to-morrow with'halfa
crew of miners. All day the Colorado
Fuel arid Iron miners have been swarm
ing into Trinidad, nearly all of them hav
ing pay checks running from $187 down.
The checks were for such amounts that
business men could not cash them and
hence lost thousands of dollars in trade.
All day long the miners have been Join
ing the United Mine "Workers. The* po
lice, who were stationed near the office of
that organization to prevent any possi
bility of a clash between the union and
non-union men, estimated that at least
800 Joined and came out showing their
union cards. The Italians have quit'al
most to a man. They have not Joined the
union to any extent, giving as their rea
son that they were sold out by the labor
organizations on two or three occasions
and they preferred to go out on their own
responsibility on this occasion. They will
stay out, their officers say, until the last,
and when one goes back to work all will
go. All the railroads have laid off train
crews. The Colorado and Southern, San
ta Fe and Denver and Rio Grande have
reduced their crews nearly one-half, It la
said, while the Colorado and Wyoming is
practically out 'of business as a coal road.
So far as can be learned there has been
no disturbance at any of the camps, but
a clash Is feared at Hastings.
TRINIDAD, Colo., Nov. 8.â It is now
evident that the strike of the coal miners
in this, the first district of the Colorado
Fuel and Iron Company, is no small af
fair. In fact. It 13 a strike all out of
proportion to that even hoped for by. the
officers of the United Mine Workers of
America, and ten times greater than ex
pected by the operators. At the meet
ing of superintendents and pit bosses held
in the Colorado Fuel and Iron offices in
Trinidad last Thursday night reports
were made that in no camp would enough
men go out to cause a shutdown.
It is. doubtful if enough men can be
found in the whole district by to-morrow
to work the mines at Primero. At Gray
Creek every miner but one has quit and
that /camp is surrounded by armed
guards. At Bowen* the men are quitting
rapidly. At Tercio the men quit early.
At Starkville, one of the camps reported
as being wholly company men, nearly
every man quit. At Piedmont the new
Rocky Mountain Fuel Company men took
their tools home.
POPE'S BLESSING
ON HIS PEOPLE
Late to-night" Stone made a rambling
statement as to the experience of him
self and Loew during last night. Neither
was physically able to assist the other,
he said, although each thought the other
was dying in great agony. He claims that
the bruises on the bodies of himself and
Loew- are due to "hazing" by their class
mates, but admits that he and Loew had
been recently initiated Into the Phi Psi
Chi fraternity.
BALTIMORE, Md., Nov. 8.â The police
are now investigating the death of Mar
tin Loew, 27 years of age, a student in
the dental department of the University
of Maryland, whose lifeless body was
found to-day in his room at his boarding
house. His roommate, Ephraim Stone, 23
years 'of age, ' was lying unconscious be
side the bed. Loew is from Silesia, Ger
many, and Stone hails from Cape Town,
South Africa. Loew, it is said, has rela
tives in New York City. His body is at
the morgue.
j It is said that the men were initiated
last week Into the Phi Psi Chi, a college
fraternity. From bruises on the bodies
of the two men it would seem that they
had been roughly handled. An Inquest
and post mortem examination will be held
to-morrow. Stone has been removed to
the Maryland University Hospital.
Stanley B. Smith of St. John, N. B.,
president of the fraternity, was arrested
to-night on the technical charge of as
sault. Twenty-five members of the so
ciety have been cited to appear before the
Coroner's jury to testify.

It was learned in official circles to-night
that the United States of Colombia has
lodged a protest with the State Depart
ment against the action of the United
States in connection with the events that
have occurred on the Isthmus of Pan
ama. The terms of the protest could not
"be ascertained to-night, but it is known
that strong objection Is made to the at
titude of the United States In general and
against Interpretations made by this
Government of the treaty of 184fi between
the United States of America and the
United States of Colombia. The State
Department has the protest under serious
consideration, but the nature of the re
ply, if any. or the time when it will be
made, is not known. Other than admit
ting that such a document had been filed
in the State Department, the officials
there would say nothing about the mat
ter.
COLOMBIA MAKES PROTEST.
"Very shortly," was the reply. "France
has already indicated unofficially her
willingness to follow the lead of the
United States."
"How soon do you expect to be recog
nized by the other powers?" the Minister
was asked.
"I consider that the republic of Pan
ama to-day is fulfilling all the duties of
a regular government. I am ready to be
gin negotiations to-morrow with the
Washington Government, which already
has extended us practical recognition. I
should say from the present outlook the
conclusion of a satisfactory treaty need
be a matter of but a short time,"
"To the Isthmian Government the canal
is the cornerstone of its future existence.
To the United States its construction is
ffcÂ» great achievement on which the
world waits. Therefore, for the general
good, delay in this matter cannot be per
mitted.
Mr. Varilla was Interviewed to-night
at hi? hotel, whero he has temporarily
established his legation.
'"Ae to my plans." he said, "it is, per
haps, a little premature for me to speak.
I shall call at th* State Department to
morrow and it will depend largely on my
conference with the officials there how
rapidly the canal negotiations can pro
ceed. We wish to go ahead as soon as
possible and to show that we shall not
tolerate the delay and procrastination
with which the Colombian canal negotia
tions dragged along to their final failure.
It is my desire, and that of tbo people of
Panama, that unnecessary red tape and
formality, no far as dignity will permit,
shall be â¢waived and that we conclude and
sign a treaty with the Washington Gov
ernment at the earliest day possible.
The new Minister's first day in Wash
ington was a busy one. He had a long
conference with Secretary Hay at the lat
tÂ»T's residence. At this time he presented
Ms credentials and the formal reception
&t the State Department â¢was arranged
for. Secretary Hay and Minister Varilla
?>!Â«r went over in considerable detail the
necessary steps toward the conclusion of
a nrw treaty, which while following to
nonip extent the Hay-Herran treaty in
many ways will be simpler. As regards
the financial conditions the Washington
Government does not desire any change,
but the provisions of the new treaty re
parding sovereignty over the canal strip
nnd the extent of the United States con
trol will be less complicated and more
positive In statement than is true of the
Hay-Herran Colombian convention.
TELLS OF REPUBLICS HOPES.
Bunau-Varilla will be received by Secre
tary Hay to-morrow morning at the State
â¢Department, and. duly recognized as the
Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Ex
traordinary of the new republic of Pan
ama to the United States. The Secretary
has invltod the new Minister to luncheon
to-morrow. The presentation of Varilla
to the President has Yiot been definitely
arranged yet. but a date probably will be
agreed on to-toiorrow.
When he calls at the State Department
th<=> new Minister will take occasion to
express through the Secretary of State to
the Washington Government the profound
* ensr of gratitude of the new republic for
"all that this country ha? done in prompt
ly extending to It recognition and the oiler
of protection.
HAY TO BECEIVE VARILLA.
Phillinpe Bunau-Varilla, the representa
tive of the isthmian de facto government
to the United States, who arrived here
last night from New York, will act as ad
\1$er of the commission which Is to nego
tiate the canal treaty, a duty that he is
v.-ell able to perform, as he was one of
the engineers of the present unfinished
canal.
The report that the administration has
already been assured that the four islands
called Perico, JCaos, Culebra and Flamen
co, in Panama harbor, will be' ceded to
the United States is not to be doubted in
view of the known willingness of the dc
facto government to grant every conces
sion that will Insure the construction of
the canal.
The new treaty will give to the United
States actual sovereignty over a canal
strip six miles wide, or a lease In per
petuity of that strip, with the right to po
lice it and control Its sanitation.
PBOPOSED TREATY'S TEEMS.

Philippe Varilla came to this country a
few years ago In behalf of the sharehold
ers of the Panama Canal Company to ne
gotiate the sale of the rights of that com
pany to the United 'States.
The story of the part Varllla took in
the Dreyfus case is an interesting oneC A
dozen years ago Philippe Varilla set out
on an expedition to Central Africa, Upon
the eve of his departure he received a
letter from Dreyfus; who had been one of
a party of French engineers to explore
the country Varilla intended to visit.
Dreyfus' letter was written with the ob
ject of advising him of the character of
the country and telling him of the best
way to succeed In his mission. . Varllla
kept the letter and filed it away with his
papers. He returned to Paris after Drey
fus had been convicted and sent to Devil's
Island. At an officers' dinner in Paris one
evening a young subaltern came In with
the celebrated bordereau which had been
used as the basis of the evidence to con
vict Dreyfus and the document was
passed around among those present Va
rilla saw the Importance of the document
as a newspaper story and asked to be al
lowed to take it until the following day.
He carried the bordereau to his home and
compared it with the letter he had re
ceived from Dreyfus on the eve of his Af
rican journey. To his great surprise there
was not the least similarity in the chirog
raphy. He carried the two documents to
his brother, the editor of Le Matin, and
the two became convinced that the bor
dereau was a forgery. Editor Varilla
caused a fac simile of the bordereau to
be made, reproduced it in'Le Matin and
asked if there were any of the readers of
the journal who could identify the author
of the document, as it evidently was not
written by Dreyfus. In response to this
appeal a Parisian stock broker appeared
at the office of Le Matin with a number
of letters written by Colonel Esterhazy.
These letters were compared with the
writing of the bordereau and it was shown
beyond question that Esterhazy was the
author.
"Philippe Buneau Varllla and Philippe
Varilla are different persons," said a gen
tleman~who knows Panama's representa
tive at Washington, "and It is the latter
who has been sent to represent the new
republic of Panama at thÂ© national capi
tal."
NEW YORK. Nov. 8.â Philippe Varilla,
the newly appointed diplomatic agent at
Washington of the republic of Panama,
Is well known to many persons in New
York and- Washington as well as In the
Inner political circles of Paris. He is a
Frenchman by birth and was educated at
the famous French military school of St
Cyr, near Paris. At St. Cyr he was a
classmate of- Emile Dreyfus and took a
prominent part in producing evidence in
the defense of that officer at his trial at
Rennes, France. Varilla's brother is the
editor of Le Matin, one of the best known
Parisian journals.

Senator Mitchell of Oregon said:
"I believe the Nicaraguan Canal is su
perior for many reasons, but am such an
earnest advocate of the construction of an
isthmian canal that I would not stand in
the* way of its building simply because it
does not follow the rouu? I want."
Senator Cullom, chairman of the Senate
Committee on Foreign Affairs, said:
"The time is over now for discussion of
the relative merits of canal routes. All
men who really favor a canal will now
unite m support Of the route which the
administration has decided upon."
"Loyal citizens should support the ad
ministration in this step. We should
spare no effort to knit closer our relations
with the South American states. I think
they look to us as their protector from
foreign aggression, but they. do not fully
understand the ties that should bind us
tog-etherâ the community of national in
terest." '

ROME:, Not. 8.â Peasants, whllÂ© digging
near Palazzolo Acirelde, Sicily, found a
rich treasure of I ancient objects from
Syracuse. The most valuable were an
artistic diadem encrusted with precious
stones and a belt of gold and several rings
of beautiful shapes. There was also found
a number of coins of different values. The
Government authorities took possession
of the treasures on the ground that they
were national property, but they will com

cording to an estimate which will be made
by. experts.

the ships building by contract for United
States navy. On the contrary every ves
sel has fallen farther behind notwith
standing the fact that labor conditions
have improved and that there has been
but little mercantile work to prevent for
warding navy contracts. The appended
table, taken from the chief constructor's
report of 1901-02-03, shows a retrogression
of work on ell the ships, not alone in the
trust yards, but in all the establishments
"ranging from one month In the case of the
Tacoma to over eight months with the
Nebraska. It is evident that the contrac
tors' estimates as to time were too low
to start with and that strikes and non
delivery of material caused the delays up
to a year ago. but that all the yards
should have fallen still farther behind
during the past year is somewhat mysti
fying. The Illinois. Maine and Cleveland
were delivered at the dates indicated, but
the completion of all the other ships, as
estimated by the Bureau of Construction,
is likely to fall considerably short in
many Instances and there are strong indi
cations that the Government may have to
take several battleships and armored
cruisers out of the hands of the contrac
tors, as It did with the Galveston and
Chattanooga. rl

o'clock in the morning, the night being ex

"George nothing could be dene to avert
the collision. The ram of the Hannibal

The German cruisers Hamburg, Berlin
and a third not yet launched are of ap
proximately the same displacement as the
eix cruisers of the Denver class building
for United States navy and contracted for
in December, 1S99. The Hamburg class is
of 3000 tons displacement, 6000 horsepower
and a calculated speed of twenty-two
knots, carrying an armament of ten 4.1
inch guns and with a coal capacity of
800 tons. The Denver Is of 3500 tons, 4700
horsepower r.nd intended to have a epced
of 16.5 knots. The armament consists of
ten 5-inch guns and the coal capacity Is
700 ton*. The advantage of superior bat
tery in the American nhips is more than
offset by the increase of five and a half
knots speed in the German ships which
also carry 100 tons of coal more than
ours. It was confidently expected at the
time the Denver class was designed that
the ships would develop a speed of sev
enteen and a half knots, but neither the
Cleveland, Des Moines nor Denver recent
ly tried came up to the contract speed
owJng probably to the lack of stimulus in
the form of premiums. The Hamburg
was laid down April 1. 1902, launched July
26 last and will bo ready for commission
In February next, making her time of
construction twenty-two months. The
Clevelandâ the only one as yet acceptedâ
was begun June 1, 1500. launched Septem
ber 28. 1901, and turned over to the navy
October 30, J903. giving a total of forty
months to build.

of young women, who will keep a vig

when one is found to report his offense
to the nearest police officer. In addition
Miss Hardin proposes to organize the
young' women in offices and shops on a

a girl has a complaint against her em
ployer she can rely on the assistance of
many of her fellow employes to prove her
charges.
The details are being carefully worked

Major Pitcher says it ia of the greatest
Importance that the boundary lines of the
park, in addition to being surveyed should
be so thoroughly marked as to render it
impossible for any one to cross the line
without knowing that he has entered the
reservation.
The bear seem-to be about as numerous
as a year ago. They have done no harm
to any one during the past season.
The deer seem to be increasing more
rapld|y._than any other game in the park,
at least they arc becoming tamer and
more fearless than any other . species.
The new buffalo herd, which is under the
immediate charge of C. J. Jones, is do-
Ing exceedingly well, but the Increase in
the herd this year was not as great as
was ho^ed for.
The mountain sheep have increased con
siderably in number in the past yaar ana
there are now mpre than ICO In the park.
"Many of them are tired of waiting,"
says Captain Young. "These big trees
grow close to the country road. The
owners have cut them by the wholesale
and put the lumber upon the market and
where once was a flnÂ«. forest of magnifi
cent giants there is now but devastation
and ruin in the shape of stumps and
sawdust piles on either side of the high
road. It is but just to the owners and
for the best interest of the Government
that the purchase; of these patented
lands within the park -be authorized by
Congress if the parks are to be contin
ued."
'He says the lands can be secured for
reasonable prices. Captain Young says
game is increasing.
Major John Pitcher's report en Yellow
stone Park is devoted largely to the con
dition of the game in that preserve. He
recommends that provisions be made for
feeding game in the park in the winter.
The danger of loss by starvation, he
says, is increasing yearly, owing to the
fact that the country around the park is
settling up. thus limiting the range. He
thinks It would not be a difficult matter
to feed the antelope and sheep, as their
winter range Is close to Fort Yellow
stone. He places the number of ante
lope in the park at about 10OO.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 8.â In his annual
report Captain Charles Young, acting su
perintendent of Sequoia and General
Grant national parks, California, in
which many giant trees' are lo
cated, urges the acquisition by the
Government of the land in those
parks now owned by private Indi
viduals. In Sequoia Park there are many

Bhould the general financial condition remain

Joseph J. Mason of Berkeley â The realty
market in Berkeley is not so active as it was
at this time last year, although elnce the
opening of the new ferry I have had many in
quiries for home sites on the lines connecting
with the new ferry, and I think that property

in July, August or September, and the realty
market looks good at the present time .for a

J. 8. Myers of Austin & Myers â The real es
tate market has been very active during the
last month, and the indications are that the
present prosperous conditions will continue.
There Is a great demand for centrally located
apartment houses and suburban homes. In the
last ten days I have sold ten lots In the vi
cinity of Thirty-second and Thirty-fourth and
Adeline streets to San Francisco Investors, and
of fifteen houses that I am now building I have
already disposed of live, although none of them
are yet completed. There is a gre,at demand
for property along the lines of the new ferry,
especially in the vicinity of the new cross
town line on Fortieth street. One of the San
Francisco men who purchased property from
me says that he can reach his place of bust
ness quicker by the new ferry than he could
by the street cars from his home In San Fran
cisco.
The inauguration of the new ferry ser
vice has had a very appreciable Influence
in stimulating the demand for property
located on or near the lines of the com
pany, and a large amount of residence
property has been sold to former subur
ban residents of San Francisco, who say
that they can reach the business district
of San Francisco quicker by the new ferry
than they could by the street cars from
their former homes.
The condition of the local real, estate
market during the last month has been
good and the dealers agree that the out
look for the next year Is most encourag
ing. Property of all kinds Is in demand
by people who intend to locate perma
nently in this city, and the renting mar
ket has been very active. The demand
for cottages has been especially brisk.

VIENNA, Nov. B.â The members of the
Vienna Medical Chamber, to which la en
trusted the professional control of the
doctors of the; city, have resigned In 'a
body as the result of a lon* fight between
the anti-Semite members / of the Landtag
of Count Klelmansegg, Governor of Low
er Austria, on one aide, and thÂ© general
body of the Vienna professors and uni
versity professors on the other.
The conflict arose over the question of
vivisection, several members of the Land
tag accusing the doctors of contravening
the vivisection law In their experiments
on animals, and also alleging that the
doctors operated on poor patients, inocu
lating them with the germs of noxious
diseases.
The physicians declare that the whole
agitation comes from the anti-Semites,
wlfo are hostile to the scientists, a large
proportion of whom in Vienna are Jews.
The accident was caused by the driv
ing wheel of the engine mounting the
left rail on the trip in. Brakeman Dixon
was in the cab on the left side. Beside
him was Parker. On the right side stood
Engineer Hicks. When the engine raised
both Dlxon and Parker prepared to jump.
They waited too long, and landed on the
ground on the left side of the engine just
as the great locomotive tottered and
rolled over on her side. Both men were
caught beneath Its weight. The condi
tion of their bodies would indicate that
they died instantly.
The one injured man is J. L Hicks, the
engineer. His left arm Is fractured and

HOODLUMS RIOT
AT SAN LEANDRO
A section man walking on the track,
however, shot at a man whom he saw
slouching along the right of way, but the
fellow disappeared In the timber, run
ning at full speed despite an order to
halt.
About ten days ago the general offices
In Chicago received a letter directing the
road to see that J100Q was thrown off No.
6, the Denver flyer, somewhere in Iowa on
Saturday night.
! Superintendent Slif er came to Des
Moines and â¢ It was decided to, make the
appearance of acceding to the demand.
But a special was made up at Council
Bluffs toÂ» follow No. 6, about ten minutes
and it bore armed men and bloodhounds.
The engineer of No. 6 was given the mon
ey to throw from his engine at the given
signal, the explosion of three torpedoes
under his side of . the machine. The tor
pedoes were not exploded. ,. ,
; To-day , i t was rumored , however, that
No. 5,^preceding No.* 6 a half -hour, had
exploded the torpedoes. This, or some
other new Information, resulted in reor
ganizing the special force of armed offi
cers which went out on a special from
Des Moines to. Dexter and then patrolled
the right-of-way between Earlham and
that town all night. Nothing developed,
however, and the men remained in the
timber watching for the criminals in
vain.
DES MOINES, la., Nov. 8,-The Rock
Island officials to-night sent out a second
special train bearing armed officers and
bloodhounds to Dexter, Iowa, In the hope
of capturing a gang of dynamiters. The
officers spent the night in the woods along
the right. of way between Earlham and
Dexter, but had no encounter with rob
bers'. 1

The new tonnage dues promulgated by
Viceroy Alexleff provide that non-Rus
sians must pay twelve times the dues
charged to Russian vessels.
The correspondent of the Dally Mall at
Tientsin cables the Russian Government
that the reoccupation . of Moukden was
made necessary because ( Japan was
menacing the province of Shinkin.
The Chefu correspondent of the Morning
Post says a Japanese steamer has been
detained at Port Arthur for entering the
port without having a pilot on board,
pilotage being now compulsory.
YOKOHAMA, Nov. 8.-It Is said In of
ficial circles at Toklo that the rumor that
negotiations between the Russians and
Japanese Governments had come to the
verge of a final settlement is misleading,
but that the Tokio Government is now
awaiting Russia's reply, which is due at
any moment, but which will only advance
the question of the Far Eastern difficulty
to another stage.
The reports of the resignation of Vice
roy Alexleff,. his change of headquarters
form Port Arthur to Vladivostok and the
dismantling of the fort at Yongampho are
all believed to indicate a temporary weak
ening of the Russian war party, but those
incidents also will further delay, a final
settlement. - Â¦-..â¢Â«'

marriage he had mentioned that he pt?
sessed a fortune. After four months of
married life with him she left him and
refused to return. She applied to the Jew

spurning her husband's money. Her trou.
bles unbalanced her mind, and she was
taken to the County Hospital Friday to
be treated for Insanity, and a complaint
was to have been Issued against her to
morrow.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 8.-Mra. Baka
Roskowitz, a pretty Polish Jewess, &>
years old, committed suicide to-day in
the County Hospital by swallowing: a pint

only five months of married life with a
husband nearly thirty years her senior to
find life what she had expected and what
she had been promised before marriage.

HARD ARGUMENTS
Coffee Uses Them Whether One Likes
or Not.
The 111 effects of coffee arÂ« present In
many coffee drinkers, but some people
pay no attention to the warning signals
like dyspepsia, insomnia, nervousness,
fluttering of the heart, etc., until coffee
finally uses a knockdown argument, which
means collapse on the part of the coffee
drinker.
"I am SO years old and have drunk cof-
fee since I c^n remember until four year*
ago, when I broke down completely with
nervous prostration and indigestion. I
simply cannot describe the agony I suf-
fered.
?'Doctor told me, he could not help me '
if I did not Uave coffee alone, so I bought
some Postum to give it a trial. At first I
did not know bow to make it and was dis-
appointed In the taste, but after reading
the directions on the package carefully
made It right, and then I thought it bet-
ter than coffee. At that time I weighed
140 pounds and now I weigh 185 pounds.
That's quite a gain, isn't it? I never have
indigestion now and the headaches are all
gone, and I am otherwise entirely well
a/id strong.
"1 never had any troubles that were not
due to drinking coffee, and these disap-
peared and health came In their place
when I shut oft coffee and drank Pos-
tum." Name given by Postum Co., Battle

Hornets Are Defeated.
OAKLAND, Nov. 8.â The San Francisco
Independents defeated the Oakland
Hornets at association football this after
noon at Idora Park by a score of 2 to 0.
The- first half was well contested and ex
citing, although the Independents scored
their two points then. In tbe second half
the ball grew flabby and thÂ» men did not
try aa hard as In tbe beginning.

tained the brunt of the battle for the
Hornets. The teams were made up of:
Independents â Forbes. Mechels. Lynch,
Owens, Smith, Nolan, Ellis, E. Fay, Arter, T.
Far. Hussell.
Â¦ Hornets â Williamson, Shand. W. Pomeroy,
Chalmers, Bird. Hunter. Taylor. Foreat, E.
Pomroy, Cowell. Conception.
In the second . period the Thistles de
fended the north goal. Soon after the
ball had been put Into play the Thistle
forwards put the ball between the posts
from, a scrimmage. Three more goals
were scored by the Thistles before time
was called, making the score: Thistles,
10 goals; Albion Rivers, 0. The Thistle
forwards had all the best of the play,
Lydon in particular delighting the spec
tators by his tricky footwork. The teams
lined up: â¢ .

only ten men on the field. As soon as the
Thistle team was complete goals came
rapidly. At the end of the first half the
score stood: Thistles, 6 goals; Albion
Rovers, 0.
The Thistle eleven won an easy victory
over the Albion Rovers In the second
match for the championship of the Cali
fornia Association Football League yes

plucky game they had no chance against
the excellent team work and short pass
ing of the Thistle eleven. The Alb.'on
Rovers also lacked a good goalkeeper, as
fully half of the shots made by the
Thistle forwards might have been kept
out by a really competent player.

The Shell Mound Park rifle range was
thronged yesterday with marksmen. The
event of the day proved to be the wind
up of the exciting competition in progress
during the year to capture the handsome
gold medal presented by Captain L. Siebe
to the members In the Norddeutscher
Schuetzen Club who would make the best
three bullseyes of the year. As yesterday
was the final shoot the members who
were in the lead made strenuous efforts
to capture the trophy. Herman Huber,
one of the best of riflemen, was the lucky
winner by the good scores of 185, 159 and
238, the total of the three scores measur
ing- but a trifle over a half-inch from a
true center.
The San Francisco Schuetzen Verein
sent over 110 members to the range to
compete In medal and turkey shooting.
The of 448, made by August Pape
in his medal 6tring, was the highest of
the club. The day's scores:

Uncle Hank was lust about ready to say a
few nice things about himself and Invite hU
friends to take souk thing in honor Â«f the se
ries that the bome baseball slurgers were Ann
to win. It looked all right till yesterday, when
the Brownies started to break up the winning
combination. They won at Oakland, 4 to .;.
Not content with that they made it even worse
at Recreation Park, 3 to 0.
Jake Tblelman performed as ha was never
known to perform at the Eighth-street lot be
fore. His record was one of tbe most remark
able made by any pitcher in the league this
season. Not only did he blank the Natives.
but he allowed them only one scratchy hit and
walked one man. Lynch got the hit and the
base on balls, a remarkable coincidence.

Fourteen tennis teams competed for the
new challenge cup yesterday on the Cal
ifornia Club courts. It was a handicap
doubles event and brought out some clev
er work. At the end of the day's play
but two teams were left in the competi
tion. They are Harry Rolfe and Herbert
Schmidt and the Smith brothersâ Chester
and Grant.
Both of these teams won their matches
without losing a set and a great match
should result when they come together
next Sunday.
Schmidt and Rolfe, with odds of "over
13" from Drurnmond MacGavin and Frank
Mitchell, were thought to have little
chance of winning. They beat the scratch
team easily, having a big. lead la both
sets.

The injured lad was placed in an auto
mobile and taken to the Park Emer
gency Hospital, where he was examined
by Dr. Boscowitz. It was found, although
badly lacerated about the face and bodyi
he had escaped serious Injury. The doc
tor who attended him feared the lad's
spine had been injured, but the partial
paralysis of the limbs was evidently due
to shock. The boy was able to converse
and after being In the hospital for an
hour he eat up and moved his limbs. He
was detained at the hospital for observa

Ryus had shut off the steam and his
car was slowing down, but it was still
polng at a fast clip when it ran Into
Reilly. The boy was thrown a number
of feet and was picked lip by a policeman.
Ryus had a narrow escape from colliding
with the track fence.
Joseph Reilly, a lad 14 years of age. re
siding with his parents at 723 Laurel
avenue, was knocked down and Injured
by an automobile driven by H. D. Ryus
ju3t after the end of the final race. Ryus
was driving a White steam touring car
and finished at a fast gait. As soon as
the race was declared ended by the
judges a crowd of people started to cross
the track from the Inner field despite po
lice warning.
George P. Fuller, the crack Olympic
Club cyclist, who.hss developed Into an
expert, ran away from Oldfield In the
novelty touring car race. Fuller showed
consummate ekill in handling his machine
and won the admiration of the champion.
The race between the White machines,
handled by H. D. Ryus and W. Grothe,
was an Interesting feature cf the day.
First one led and then the other, and
when the fifth mile was nearly finished
both chauffeurs were even up. They came
down the homestretch at terrific speed,
both crossing the line almost even. A
shout went up that it was a dead heat,
but the judges decided that Grothe had
won by one-fifth cf a second.
BARNEY OLDFIELD again proved
himself the hero and the central
figure at the automobile races
held at Ingleside track yesterday
Â¦' afternoon under the auspices of
the Automobile Club of California. He nav
igated his 120-hors<?-power gasoline racer
"Bullet No. 2" around the track at less
than a mile a minute for ten miles, shat
tering the record he made on the previous
day. His time for the third mile was 56
seconds, one-fifth of a second outside the
American record he established on the
Empire City track. By making this time
Oldfleld won the $100 prize offered by L. P.
Lowe if he beat 5S 4-5 seconds.
Oldfield"s performance was sensational
in the extreme. The spectators breath
lessly watched the daring motorist steer Â¦
his phantom car within a foot of the
fence. With consummate skill Oldfield
drove the machine at high speed and In
passing the Judges' stand at sixty miles i
an hour cooly waved his hand as a signal
that he was after the record. His per
formance was one that once seen will
never be forgotten. It was an exhibition
of nerve and skill seldom equaled In any
competition. Oldfield likes the Ingleside
track and will strive in a day or two to
beat the record he established in New
Tork.

SUMMARY.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 8.â Dr. Newton,
the bijr left-handed pitcher of the Los
Angeles team, pitched a phenomenal
game against Oakland this afternoon. Ho
shut them out without a hit or a run,
gave no bases on balls, hit no one with
a pitched ball and struck out five. It was
probably the most remarkable* pitching
feat ever seen on the coast, and certainly
was the limit for the season. The Oak
land batters were given life- on first base
through errors by Wheeler and Smith,
but they failed to reach second. Not a
single Oakland player was left on bases.
McKay's brand of pitching would have
won most games, as ho scattered the
eight hits made by the locals along:
six innings. Los Angeles scored the only
runs made In the fifth on hits by Ro.Â«s
and Raymond and Moskiman's error.
Raymond's batting and fielding were
features of tho game. Eager was hit by a
foul tip and suffered a badly split finger.
It is said by the best baseball authority
in this city that Newton's feat has never
been equaled and that It establishes a
new record in the baseball world. There)
have been other no-hit games pitched,
but to-day's was the first on record
where there were no base* on l-alls and
no one left on bases. The gaixre that
comes the nearest to Newton's fca* was
pitched by Rube Waddell. also a lÂ«tt
hander and formerly a member of tho
Los Angeles team. /Waddell, however,
gave two bases on balls and consequently
two men were left on bases.

DISPATCHES from Budapest give news of Emperor
Francis Joseph's temporary bridging of the widening
rift between Austria and Hungary by granting im

tion of. the dual monarchy. After allowing the country to
be in a state of practical anarchy since September 30," the date
of the fall of j Count Hedavary's Ministry, the leaders; in the
Hungarian Parliament have at last become reconciled for the
nonce and the fractious wheelhorse of \ that, .remarkable
Hapsburg tandem will swing into the middle of the road for
a little while longer. It* is air because the old Emperor has
perforce decreed that the Hungarian tongue shall be spoken
in the military colleges of the eastern kingdom of the dual
monarchy instead of: German, and that Hungarian officers
shall be transferred from Austrian regiments to' those of their
native country. ''c'} '
The world at large knows very little of the political -moil
and trouble which has been straining the bands of union
between Austria and Hungary since June 8, 1867, the day
when Francis Joseph, Emperor of Austria, became King of
Hungary. The stormy meetings of the joint houses of both
countries have become a byword â¢ in - the mouth of the na
tions, but few besides the trained diplomats have troubled
themselves . to look below the. surface ' and see the funda^
mental causes of the long continued . strife between Teutonic
Austria and Slavic Hungary. The ;bitter quarrel over the
seemingly trivial question of whether the officer in charge
of a Hungarian regiment shall say "yorwarts" or its Magyar
equivalent is only a straw which points the wind.
~ The Austro-Hungarian state is .manifestly an artificial
union. There is a King over both component parts of the
empire who b/ his personality alone has been j able to ihold

watch was slow. The better timepieces
had lagged behind some seconds. The
cheaper watches were a minute or more
out of the way. Next morning every one
of the lot was exactly right.

I 'maintain most strongly that there is
a remedy for vice. And that remedy con
sists in making marriage possible among
the poor and in providing for such peo
ple a borne.
In this country. It is true, there is a
brighter side to the question than in Eu

In London out of every 1000 marriage

generally speaking, less -than one-third of
the marriageable population of -* London

Yet it is the right of the poor to have a
borne. With them that right Is as in
alienable and perhaps more precious than
with the rich. And social conditions
ehould be so arranged as to allow the
poor to escape from the burden of vice
through the blessed bonds of matrimony.
These conditions, which are rendering
marriage among the poor more and more
Impossible, are every day bringing more
and more sin into the world.
How, for instance, can a poor man take
to himself a wife when the cost of living
Is Â«o high that he can barely support life
in himself? How can he ask a woman to
share his lot when he knows he may at
any time be thrown out of work and per
haps he obliged to watch her etarve?
How can & man rear a family when the
chances may all be against his being able
to -maintain it? For a man cannot main
tain a family when he has no work. The
eight of a starving wife and children has
driven many a man to desperationâ even
to crime. Â¦: V. >.;
Conditions among the poor are in many
cases such that the rearing and the keep-*
ing together of a family are rendered im
possible. On every hand the poor man's
efforts to establish and maintain the sa
cred relations of matrimony are discour
aged.
I say this advisedly. Among the poor
Infidelity is far less frequent than among
the rich. The poor man and his wife hold
the . marriage relation more sacred than
do those of greater worldly wealth.
It is therefore doubly unfortunate that
a class so worthy of the blessings of mat
rimony Ehould be so frequently debarred
from those blessings; that the people who
maintain the sanctity of the marriage tie
and who. moreover, bring "up larger fam
ilies as a rule than do persons better able
to afford to do so, should be forced to re

marriages are of no advantage to the

"Marriage is an honorable estate" and
"not to be entered into lightly." But, too
often, under present conditions, the poor
man cannot afford to enter into it at all.
Yet he. perhaps far oftener than his
wealthier brother, recognizes the "honor
able" condition of that "estate."
or financial advancement; it may be a
mere matter of convenience; it may be
the outcome of idleness and propinquity.
But marriage among the poor is the
most cogent means of reform. By mak
ing marriage universally possible among
those who are not blessed with an abun
dance of this world's goods the most
deadly blow Imaginable would be dealt
to vice. The greatest step would by such
means be taken toward vice's utter elim

Whenever Alice sings a song she winds
it up with an injunction to her auditors
to "clap hands," no doubt feeling that
she is entitled to some sort of reward for
her effort. One night . when she began
her usual evening prayer she asked bless
ings on a number of people whom she des
ignated by name and then solemnly fin
ished the prayer with, "Now clap hands,"
much to the consternation of some of her
religious relatives, who had gathered in
force to see her safely off to sleep.
Alice, the two and a half . year old
daughter of a Western Addition resident,
has established quite a reputation for
naive sayings, considered remarkable for
one of her tender age. Alice's grand
mother undertook the task of teaching
the little one to pray, and one night, after
Alice; had been taught to bless herself,
she repeated the'words, "God bless papa
and mamma, Amen," after her grand
mother. The latter thought this was
quite enough for the first attempt, but
Alice looking gravely up into the old
lady's face said:
"Don't you want God to bless you, too,
grandma?"
As Alice grew more proficient she added
the names of many of her relatives and
acquaintances to the list of those whom
she desired Divine Providence to bless.
One night, however, she was feeling more
than usually tired after her day's romp
ing and she dismissed the subject of
prayer by hurriedly saying:
Baby's Idea of Prayer.

"The celluloid comes to the factory in
sheets 20 inches by 50 inches, and each
sheet is a transparent film five-one thou
sandths of an inch thick. The printed
paper, with a sheet of celluloid over it,
Is put in a hydraulic press, the bottom
of which is heated by steam or gas. The
hydraulic pressure, combined with the
heat, causes the paper to adhere so close
ly to the celluloid that they are practi
cally one sheet. The celluloid, besides
serving to protect the paper, makes the
print and color richer and brighter. If
the order for the buttons is small the
paper -is dipped into a solution of grain
alcohol or gelatine and is made to adhere
to the celluloid by a hot hand roller.
"The prints are next taken in hand by
boys, who, with rawhide mallets and hol
low punches, cut out each . round print,
and these boys are so expert that one of
them, working eight hours, can punch out
15,000 a day. A finished button: is made
up of the 'print,' the shell, the collet and
pin. The shell is a steel disk, and forms
the body of the button. The collet 4s a
tin ring, which holds the print over the
shell, and they are all brought together
in the button machine, which Is a simple
mechanism, whose principal features are
a plunger and two dies. The shell Is laid
In one die. with the print on top of it.
The operator brings down a treadle and
the print Is pressed over and around the

moves up it carries with it the print cov
ered shell. The collet Is laid in the other
die, which Is swung under the plunger,
the treadle comes down again, and the
tin ring Is crimped solidly- around the
shell and the button is formed. Then
the pin, made of brass : wire., fs . slipped
under the incurving edges of the collet
and is held there by its own spring.
"The beginning of a campaign button
is the candidate and next his photograph.
If the picture is to be printed a half
tone engraving is made, and if the order
is large enough to warrant it a number
of electrotypes are made from the half

printed on a sheet. If the candidate
wants something first class and doesn't
mind the extra expense a lithograph of
the photograph is made and the pictures
are printed on a lithographic press.
"Most of the men who have worn cam
paign buttons believe that the picture and
words are printed on celluloid. Few of
them know that the celluloid is trans
parent and that the printed part of the
button is on paper under the glossy cel
luloid cover. For some time this little
trick was kept as a sort of trade secret,
and a few years ago no outsider was
permitted to wander at will around a
campaign button factory. The ordinary
button for campaign use is seven-eighths
of an inch in diameter, and they range all
the way from three-quarters of a cent to
$1 50 each.
The button manufacturer was talking:

Making Campaign Buttons.
BY MALCOLM McDOWELI*
Colonel James A. Buchanan, for three
years in command of the American mili
tary forces In Porto Rico, recently paid
a hleh compliment to the military spirit
of our subjects there. He said:
"I left Porto Rico with genuine reluc
tance, modified only by the fact that I
probably remained on the island as long
as was wise on account of my health.
I organized the Porto Rico regiment and
was deeply interested in the organization.
The Porto Ricans make splendid soldiers.
They are amenable to discipline and learn
rapidly. Tfhey drill like seasoned veter
ans. They are willing to do any service
demanded of them. They are so+>er and
loyal to their officers. They have a pride
in the uniform and an affection for the
flag. The people of Porto Rico are also
very proud of the regiment. It has ex
erted a splendid influence upon the people
of the island and has been a great schoo!.
The men in the regiment have not only
learned to speak our language but are
now expert interpreters. They are nat
urally good penmen and they translate
the two languages back and forth with
great facility. I think It would be a
splendid proposition for the Government
to send the regiment into camp at the
St. Louis Exposition for two or three
months. It would be a liberal education
of the Porto Ricans In American life and
methods which they would lucidly explain
to the people on their return, and It would
afford those who visit the fair an oppor
tunity to become familiar with Porto Ri
can character under most satisfactory
conditions."

' "There is a certain prominent attorney
in this city," said a lounger at the Palace
Hotel a few nights ago, "who owes his
present position to the quickness of wit
he displayed at a banquet he attended at
the very outset of his career.
"This man, who for convenience sake
we will call Bob, was the protege of a
very prominent man. He shoved Bob to
the front every time opportunity offered,
and more than once he provided the op
portunity.
"Well, one night he informed Bob that
he was to be a guest at a banquet to be
given to a big railroad official, and told
him to "be prepared to make a speech.
â¢And, Bob,' he said, 'it's got to be a good
one, for the best talkers of the State will
be there.' Bob went to work on his
speech and when the night of the ban
quet came around he was prepared to
cover himself with glory. Really, his
speech was a gem, for I read it only a
few days ago.
"But it was never delivered. When he
was called Bob arose, assumed a correct
attitude, and started off with, 'Gentle
men.'" That was as far he. he got. for he
could not for the life of him remember an
other word of the speech he had spent so
many weary hours in preparing. He re
alized that he was done for unless some
thing happened. He suffered agonies for
a moment and then his quickness of mind
saved him. He allowed his knees to bend
slowly beneath the lable. closed his eyes
and grasping his heart with both hands
fell with a crash on the table."

MOVED by President Roosevelt's letter on race^sui
/ cide, the London Mail has collected statistics tend
â¢ ing to show that the English-speaking peoples of
the world have a birth, rate so rapidly diminishing there is
danger it will eventually approach the zero point and the
race now so dominant in the world will sink to comparative
insignificance. It is not in old England alone that the race
is dying, but everywhere. In Canada the English-speaking
people do not multiply like the French-speaking clement of
the population. In Australia the birth rate is very low and
in the United States, the ratio of births among the Anglo-
Saxon portion of the population is less than that among the
immigrants from Continental Europe.
In reviewing the statistics the Mail says: "What are the
explanations of the failing birth rate in the English-speaking
countries? Mr. Coghlan suggests Jn the case of Australia
that it is due to the love of pleasure and to the deliberate
limitation of families. ' His argument seems to be borne out
by some very striking facts noted by Mr. and Mrs. Webb in
their work on 'Industrial Democracy.' They state that
'there are many indications that the danger to be appre
hended in Northwestern Europe during the coming century
is not overpopulation, but a deliberate restriction of popula
tion by the more prosperous, more intelligent and more
thrifty sections, brought about by a rise in the standard of
life itself.' That is the admission that the superior race is
too expensive to multiply; it means the suicide of that race
; and its slow replacement by other human material."
* , A curious side issue to the subject is presented by the fact
that the decline in the birth rate of the Anglo-Saxon,
whether in the Old World or the New, coincides with a rise
in the birth rate of certain oriental races that were at one timg
supposed to be about exhausted. While no exact statistics
arc available on the subject there are good reasons for be
lieving that the Japanese and Chinese races are much more
fruitful than they were some years ago, and it would seem
they are better fitted to survive under modern industrial
conditions than are the higher peoples of England, Australia
and the United States.
In our own country the decline of the birth rate among
the Anglo-Saxon elements of the population is not notice
able because of the mixture of races here and the vigor of
the American race that, is being developed by the intermar
riages of men and' women from all civilized countries. In
Great Britain, however, the. decline is quite notable and is ac
companied by a decline in the physical strength of the peo
ple. Some authorities attribute the deterioration to the ef
fects of urban life and the objection of landlords in cities to
let their premises to families in which there are a large num
ber of children.
The Mail says: "Australia and England are both states in
which the huge city predominates, and it is at least a note
worthy fact that the marked fall in our birth rate coincides
with the, collapse of agriculture, which forced our country
population more and more into the towns from 1878 onward.
This may be a mere. accident, but country families are still
generally larger, if only because of the difficulty of housing
in -the towns. No point is more painful in Mr. Booth's
great study of London than his repeated reiteration of the
fact that large families are regarded by landlords as a
nuisance and that the large family, is too often refused ac
commodation where the small family finds no difficulty in
obtaining it." . ,
The problem is the more interesting because it is only a
generation ago since men were preaching in England the
doctrine that the welfare of the country depended on a
diminution of, the' birth rate, and one philosopher spoke of
the large families that seemingly handicapped the workman
frv his struggle to improve his condition as "a devastating
torrent â¢ of children." Times have changed since then.
Great Britain is now longing for British children to populate
her empire and is fearing a' devastating torrent of foreigners.

portance that he actually invoked the as
sistance of the old Emperor against her.
It was during the time of her first mar
riage to the late Count SchleiniU. Min
ister of the imperial house at Berlin, and
in those days her salon was not only the
meeting place, of everything that was
graceful, artistic and witty In the Ger
man capital, but likewise the headquar
terB of all thÂ« foes of Prince Bismarck.
"The Countess, who by reason of her pas
sion for Wagnerlan music used to be
known as 'La Princesse Thompette.*
never lost an opportunity of provoking
the old Chancellor, and I remember that
on one ocacsion, when M. de Sabouroff,
the Russian Embassador, was expected
to attend an important meeting at Bis
marck's palace In Wilhelmstrasse, the
Countess prevailed on the envoy to ac
company her to a garden party, and
thereby kept the Chancellor waiting for
him the entire afternoon. Bismarck's
rage at this treatment on the part of the
Muscovite Embassador was so great that
he actually went to the length of per
suading the St. Petersburg Department of
Foreign Affairs to recall a diplomat who
was frivolous enough to prefer tho so
ciety of a Countess of Schlelr.it z to that
of the Chancellor of the German empire.
"After the death of the old Count
Schlelnltz the in those days ethereal and
blonde Countess gave her hand In mar
riage to Count Wolkensteln Trostb,urg,
who had long been devoted to her and
who was the hero In the romance of her
life. When he was appointed Embassador
to Paris she found herself In her ele
ment and together with the Countess de
Greffuhle (formerly Princess de Chimay)
is responsible for having converted the
Parisians to Wagnerianism and for hav
ing aroused In their breasts wild enthus
iasm about the very German composer
who In his lifetime they had hissed off the
stage."

which is hard to explain. Now there wuz
the case of old Mokulumne Johns, who
died up in Washoe County. over Nevada

"Quarte" on Religion.
Railroad* operating east of the Mississippi are carrying
less tonnage than a year ago, and but few complaints of
scarcity of cars are now heard. Food products are easing
off, provisions are quiet at Western packing centers and the
packers are apathetic in supporting- their'.; local markets.
Trade in clothing is reported quieter and last year.
This applies more to woolens, as the cotton manufacturing
districts are sending in reports of an increase in activity.
It is interesting to observe that whereas cotton "lagged be
hind all other lines during the recent era of unprecedented
trade activity it is now making the best showing when busi
ness *is quieting down. In this connection the South is
sending in the best reports at present instead of the. reverse,
which characterised that region for several years.- The activ
ity in cotton is probably the cause of this. Another note
worthy feature in this connection is that while railway and
industrial stocks in Wall street have been going down the
cotton market. has been going up, with pronounced activity
and buoyancy during the past week.
The other staples show no important changes. What ap
plies to those already mentioned applies to almost all. Hides
are easing off in price and the markets are quieter. Wool is
dull and stocks of raw are accumulating somewhat. The
tendency in grain is downward rather than upward, though
the shrinkage is not especially marked. The wholesalers
and jobbers say that the volume of trade is not up to the
average of the past four or five years. But in spite of this
diminution in the volume of business money continues plen
tiful throughout the country and thus far there is no serious
impairment noticeable in collections. Failures,' however,
have been somewhat more numerous and larger during the
past month, although those last week were numerically
smaller, being 246, against 279 during the corresponding
week last year. There were several large suspensions in
Colorado, as mentioned above, but along the Atlantic sea
board there were few of first importance. The bank clear
ings of the country were still behind those of 1902, the de
crease for the w*eek being 15.3 per cent, with the gains and
losses about equally distributed among the largest cities.
Â¦ Wall street stocks continue unsettled, declining one day
and recovering the next. There is still some liquidation, but
the brunt of it is apparently over. In spite of the assurances
of bankers and other financial authorities that stocks are
now down where they can be bought with reasonable safety
and a fair promise of profit the public are' not taking hold of
the market. Money has not yet become tight, as expected
along in the spring, and with the regular fall exports of
grain, cotton and other products to Europe a tide of gold is
setting in from that part of the world toward this. A com
parison between this year and last shows an enormous
change in conditions during the twelve months. Then call
money ruled from 20 to 30 per cent and stocks were 40
points higher than at present, while money to-day is 4j4@6
per cent. Besides we were then exporting gold and now we
are importing it. There is certainly nothing panicky in this
showing.
On this coast business, although naturally exhibiting less
activity in sympathy with the East, is still good, without,
however, any signs of a boom. Local wholesalers and job
bers are not complaining, collections are fair, the banks are
abundantly supplied with funds and solvent borrowers find
no difficulty in securing all needed accommodation at nor
mal rates of interest. The export trade of the Pacific sea
ports continues satisfactory and the products of the farm and
factory are still bringing remunerative prices.-
CONSERVATISM continues the keynote to trade.
The word is now as freely employed as '-that. familiar
phrase, "undigested securities," was some, months
ago. One cannot pick up a trade report without finding
"Conservatism" emblazoned thereon. It is for the time
being a synonym for quietude.
The fact is that business is still slackening off throughout
the country, and from all quarters reports- of larger sup
plies of goods and a diminished demand for them are being
received. This particularly applies to iron and steel; and their
products, which are as prominent now in this respect as they
were in the boom of the past few years, when the whole
country was surprised at the enormous demand for iron in
its varied forms. The production of the has at last
overtaken the consumption, and mills continue to close
here and there, or suspend operations '-more or less. Per
contra, some mills have reopened. Steel billets have been fur
ther cut $4 per ton, and it is hoped that this radical reduction
will result in more business. Lumber is steady as a whole,
but building operations are decreasing throughout the East
and West and structural work is not showing the activity of
the past few years. Coal mining, too, has apparently re
ceived a check, and in some States, notably Colorado, mines
are being closed down, while labor disturbances, which
usually accompany dullness in any particular line, ar.^ break
ing out in the mining districts.
â¢'Place waste labor on waste land by
means of waste capital, and thereby con
vert the trinity of waste into a unity of
production."
From a sociological standpoint there are
many arguments for allowing the poor
man to have a home and family. "It is his
right. He Is fonder of his children, as a
rule, than Js his rich neighbor. His home
is dearer to him. Home ties are his only
Joys, his only recreation. â¢
When I find a man starving and unable
to support his family I do not believe in
tearing out his heart by proposing the
breaking up of his home and the commit
ment of his children to an institution. I
suggest to him, -rather, that he go into
the country, where work Is more plentiful
and living is cheaper, and I try to find the
means for htm to do so.
Perhaps the best maxim to solve the
marriage problem among the poor is:
During my recent visit to Kansas City
several married women applied to me for
positions on. the Salvation Army farms.
On investigation I learned that they had
not se^n nor heard from their husbands
for yearB.
I made inquiries, and in each case found
that the wage-earner of the family, un
able to get v/ork. had gone away, penni
less, to seek a livelihood elsewhere, and
had been forced to leave his wife and lit
tle ones to shift for themselves. The sto
ries were profoundly pathetic. For they
told of men and women whose right to
wed and rear families was inalienable and
yet who had been forced to part from all
that each held dear. Poverty, not more
rr.freiful death. dicLthem part. Can any
situation be lmaarlnecl that would be more
crushing to a man of heart and of pride
than to be forced thus to condemn to pov
erty and loneliness the woman he loved?
Could witnesses to such a tragedy require
a stronger deterrent to matrimony?
There is far more suffering of this kind
among the poor than the world at large
ever hears of. Poor people are proud, and
most of them have a passionate love of
home. I have seen whole families resign
themselves to probable death sooner than
t~" allow their homes to be broken up.
The great dread of the unfortunate poor
is lest their children be taken away from
them and committed to an institution.
" Domiclde." cr the breaking up of the
home, is to the poor man what regicide is
to loyal subjects of any king.
state of matrimony. More than two
thirds are single. The conditions for
marriage there are all against the poor
man and woman. They may fall in love
as utterly as could any millionaire, but
the gates of the Eden of matrimony are
closed against them and guarded. by the
flaming sword of poverty. They may sigh
for marriage, but they realize that such
a luxury is far and away above their
means.
In this country the marriage statistics
are almost exactly the opposite of Lon
don's. Here about two-thirds of the mar
riageable population are married, leaving
barely a third unwed.
Tariff and educational questions have been fought out in
cessantly. The growing influence of the German empire in
the Austrian half oMhe empire has estranged the nobles of
Hungary more and more. Hungary feels that the Aiistrians
have been encouraging the revolts of the Croats against her
authority. But the primal factor in the spirit of 4 disunion
springs from the eternal antipathy of race against race. The
tiheonquered Magyar with the blood of the Tartars still in
his veins and stiff with the pride of an ancient succession'of
Kings, cannot be ' yoked with the equally proud Austrian,
whose house of Hapsburg lias ruled since the Crusades.
Napoleon found the spirit of nationality first in down
trodden Spain and he was finally ejected from the peninsula.
The reactionary Congress of Vienna tried to weld Belgium
and Holland into an artificial state nearly a . hundred years
ago and their work was undone by revolution. Austria tried
later to make herself supreme over an Austrian Italy, but she
was turned back by Victor Emmanuel, the Sardinian. So in
evitably there must come the severance of the false bonds
which tether, the one to the other alien; nationalities. When
death remove? Francis' Joseph, the personal, factor which has
kept this inharmonious. union intact, Europe may see Hun
gary resume her position as an independent-power.

In speaking of his choice of subject,

That little passage of Bret Harte's struck

of his best work. Therefore I chose It as my
subject, because the sentiment should be one
of mourning. The plan also Includes medallion

urged him to a course of foreign study,

who has opened a delightfully plain studio
at 919 Ellis street. There are none of the

girl, deep In her clay from morning till
night, and fairly, bubbling over with the

THE most important recent produc
tions from local sculptors Is the
sketch presented by Robert I.
Aitken for the proposed monument
to Bret Harte to be erected by the
Bohemian Club and placed in one of the
public parks of this city. The movement
was started recently among the club
members and Charles Rollo Peters, the
painter, headed the subscription list with
an offer of one of his canvasea.- ; It is
proposed to raise a fund of $4000 for the
monument and members of the club have
been asked to subscribe this amount,
which It Is thought will be readily obtain
able.
The sketch of Mr. Altken has been on
exhibition in the Bohemian Club rooms
for seme days. Artistically tand emblem
atically it is a striking piece of work. Its
idea is based on the following extract
from Bret Harte's "Tennessee's Pardner,"
describing the burial of Tennessee:
Resisting any proffers of assistance, he be
gan to fill in the grave, turning his back upon
the crowd, that after a few minutes' hesita
tion gradually withdrew. As they crossed the
little ridge that hid Sandy Bar from view,
some looking back, thought they saw Tennes
see's Pardner. his work done, sitting upon the
grave, his ehovel between hie knees and his
face buried in Mb red bandanna handkerchief.
But it was argued by other* that you couldn't
Jell his face from hto handkerchief at that dls
"tance and this point remains undecided.
The monument proposed by Sculptor
Aitken is the life-sized figure of an old
miner, "his shovel between his knees"
and his face burled in one hand. The art
ist has solved the question of the ban
danna handkerchief. The figure is seated
upon a mound of loose earth, and a pine
bough, so emblematic of Harte's best
work, trails down over the edge of the
base.
The figure of the old miner Is the acme
of hopeless dejection. All of the tragedy
and deprivation of death Is conveyed in
the bowed head, with the face all but
concealed by the massive hand. It needs
no grave, no further suggestion of sor
row to indicate that the end of all hope,
Joy and love has come to the brawny,
gray old man "with his shovel between
posturing, of the hands and the draping
of the hair to convey the head, hood and
wings of an owl, so that from a distance
and from the rear the statue will typify
the Bohemian Club's emblem without 'in
any way destroying the symmetry of the
figure of the beautiful woman. The Idea
is strikingly original and daring and In
its present development promises great
things. . Other work in hand are two de
signs for mantels that have been accept
ed, some excellent arid original friezes
and a number, of other, architectural de
signs that show much artistic merit.

In a Elmple death notice the demise of
a locally celebrated character of a few
years ago was published In all the pa
pers of last Saturday. "John Harrington,
aged 62 years," is the manner in which
his passing was announced.
The deceased was no other than "Hap
py Jack," who from 1865 until ten years
ego was the subject of many a newspaper
wticle. Some of these comments -were
good, but as a rule otherwise. "Happy
.*ack" Harrington came in for words that
Â¦were hardly coming to a man whose heart
m-rs once in the right place.
W'hen "Jack" first reached California
lie at once added himself to the "gang."
He was a handsome, good natured fel
low anJ typical of the Ntw York rounder
ifho came to San Francisco to get the
money that was plentiful about the gam
bling-houses that filled the district where
the Hall of Justice now stands.
â¢Jack" was known then as a man who
r^uld bunko the verdant visitor to the city
with a frequency that was astonishing
to the more polished members of the fra
ternity that lived by their wits. Not that
he was a card player, or a sure-thing
rn2n. but with that suavity of speech that
is in this day designated as confidence
talk "Happy Jack" was In a class by
himself.
FATAL B.ESULT OF BRAWL.
Down at the southwest corner of Jack
son and Kearny streets one night "Jack"
pot into trouble with "Billy" Dwyer. and
the result of the quarrel was that Dwyer
was killed.
"Jack" at his trial claimed self-defense
and the jury took that view of It. For
a whale after that Harrington, by his un
ceasing energy, managed to accumulate
quite a fortune for one of his class, and
during his prosperity he was looked upon
as one of the best dressers along the
line of the tenderloin. In the latter
part of the seventies Harrington in\*ested
his money in a variety hall at the south
east corner of Third and Mission streets,
In the basement of the Crooks building.
Fortune was still kind to him and his
money, while much of it went to his
tailors and jewelers, was spent in charity
and in good times for himself and friends.
No becgar, however lowly, was ever
passed by by "Jack," and many a heart
was gladdened with the pieces of coin
that came from "Happy's" pocket when
the hand of friendship was extended.
When times changed "Jack," like other
old-timers of his ilk, commenced to feel
the difference, but tried hard to keep up
his end and display his usual spirits.
Finally business at his place waned to
such an extent that he was forced to give
up his theater, and before he realized it
he was again penniless.
EETTJBNS TO OLD LIFE.
"Happy Ja<:k." under the depressing
influence of hard times, soon again
became a "rounder." To vary the
monotony and In a spirit of earnestness
"Jack" joined the Salvation Army, and
in spite of the jeers of his friends kept it
up for some time.
He finally deserted the Salvationists, 1 re
joined his old associates again and one
night was arrested on a charge of robbery.
He was convicted and sent to San Quen
tin for a term of years, but after a short
time his frienda interested themselves in
his case, proved his innocence and pro
cured his pardon.
When "Jack" came out he had to de
pend on his friends for a while, until
he secured a job in a saloon.
About ten years ago Harrington fell
on the sidewalk, broke his leg and had
to have it amputated. Since then he had
eked out an existence by peddling lottery
tickets.
The funeral will take place to-day at
1 o'clock from an Eddy-street undertak

CONEY ISLAND BECOMES
CENTER OF ATTRACTION
"Birth of Christ" Is Special Feature
at New Resort Near Ocean
Beach.
A large crowd of people assembled at
Coney Island Gardens yesterday and en
joyed the vaudeville programme and side
attractions. Amateurs contributed to the
entertainment, and the spectators got
their* money's worth. The programme
ended with a four-round boxing contest
between Deacon Jones from Darktown
and Jim Brooks from Dundee. Owing to
a slight accident Miss Madge Emerson did
not make a balloon ascension.
The "Birth of Christ," a spectacular and
model exhibit, which Is shown in the old
depot building, is. a great attraction.
Every incident and scene In connection
with the coming of the Redeemer is shown
in miniature and is exceedingly realistic.
Giuseppe Costanza, who planned and
placed the exhibit, profited by the expe
rience of his father, he having been em
ployed to place the cribs and some of the
statuary in St. Peter's, In Rome.
Among the exhibitors, who number over
twenty-five of California's representative
artists, are such well-known painters as
Charles Rollo Peters, C. J. Dlckman, /.
"W. Clawson, Harry Stuart Fonda. G. Ca
denasso, Lucia K. Matthew, L. Maynard
Dlxon, John M. Gamble and N. W. Sea
well. The sculptors include A. Putnam,
R. I. Altken and A. Le Jeune.
About 150 canvases of various sizes in
oil, water color and pastelle will be hung,
showing the latest and best effects of
the various contributors who have been
preparing for some months to make this
exhibition notable as an artistic success.
The salon opens Wednesday afternoon
at 2 o'clock and will continue opened the
remainder of the week, both afternoon
and evening. The opening day will be
patrons' day. The rest oi the week the
exhibition will be open to the public gen
erally. No charge will be made for ad
mittance and all art lovers will be cor
dially welcomed.
George E. Saner, a druggist of Denver.
Colo., arrived in this city yesterday and
is stopping at the Russ House. The ob
ject of his visit is to Institute suit to re
cover real estate in this city claimed to
be valued at nearly $500,000 and which has
been In the name of the late Dr. I*. C.
Lane and comprises part of the large es
tate left by the deceased physician.
Saner claims that he and four other
heirs of the late Dr. E. S. Cooper of
Galesburg, 111., are entitled to this prop
erty under the will of the late Dr. Ellas
Cooper of this city, founder of the Coop
er Medical College and one of the most
eminent practitioners in the history of
San Francisco. According to Saner'a
statement, Dr. Ellas Cooper left to his
brother. Dr. E. S. Cooper of Galesburg,
certain parcels of land in this city which
the latter never conveyed to any one.
Saner is a grandson of the Eastern Dr.
Cooper and is one of five direct heirs.
After Dr. Ellas Cooper's death in this
city, Saner says, Dr. Lane bought out the
Interests of all the other heirs in the
estate except that of his grandfather, who
refused all of Dr. Lane's offers. Not
withstanding this, according to Saner, Dr.
Lane took possession of the holdings and
enjoyed all the profits from them, and
when he died conveyed them with his
own property to the beneficiaries of his
will. Saner's grandfather never made any
attempt to assert his rights, according to
his grandson, but told his grandchil
dren that the property was his and that
they would succeed to all his interests
In it.
Saner says he has not had an oppor
tunity to examine Into the exact status
of tha property as yet and was not in a
position to state more fully what his ex
act plans are. He has employed counsel
who will begin an Immediate Investiga
tion Into the records with the intention
of instituting such proceedings as may be
best to determine the proper ownership
of the real estate in question.
Says His Grandfather Owned
Property Conveyed by
the Doctor.

Movements of Steamers.
, The German I ship Wlllkommen, Captain
Freeze, arrived at Seattle yesterday. 136 days
from Rio de Janeiro. Ehe had been quoted on
the reinsurance list at 10 per cent.
There was only one change on the reinsur
ance list yesterday, and that was the with
drawal of the Willkommen,
Overdue^ Ship Turns T7p.
The steamer Aberdeen, from Portland, re
ports that on November 5, when off the Ump
qua Ilivrr. shs passed through a -large quan
tity of ties end lumber. A terrific gale was
blowing :ii the time and the waves were roll-
Ing mountains hlch. Â¦ ....
Lumber Floating at Sea.
The German ship Herzogln Sophie Charlotte
arrived at Honolulu yesterday, 138 days out
from Hamburg. This makes the chances of
the French bark Paris, from the same port,
bound to Honolulu, look rather ellm, as she is
already now cut 182 days.
Herzogin at Honolulu.
The schooner Mary Dodge, Captain Olsen,
which left here on November 5 for Eureka, re
turned to port yesterday. On the 7th lnst.,
when five miles northwest of Point Reyes, a
heavy squall struck her, which carried away
her jib boom, so the captain deemed it ad
visable to put back to port.
Hay Dodge Returns.
The â¢whaling steamer Alexander, fifteen daya
from Unalaska, arrived yesterday. She brings
12,000" pounds of whalebone, valued at $60,000.
Captain Tllton reports an uneventful voyage.
The bark left here April 1, hence her voyage
has lasted 7 months and 7 days. She Is con
signed to II. Llebes & Co.
Alexander in Port.
The old whaling bark Andrew Hicks arrived
In port late Saturday night. She brought 850
barrels of oil. Captain Williams reports that
on May 17 Gustave Mattson, a native of Ger
many, aged 50 years, died, and that on July 1
Ben Santos, a native of Guam, aged 40 years,
died. Both were buried at sea. On August
15, in Okhotsk Sea, she lost her starboard
quarter boat in a heavy southeast gale.
On September 20 the whaling bark John and
Wlnthrop was spoken and she reported that
she had caught one whale. The Hicks left
hero January 8, which makes the duration of
her voyage ten months.
She is consigned to the Western Repair and
Supply Company.
Whaling Bark 1 Arrives.
The masters of the ships have made
hosts of friends in port and this adds an
unusual amount of interest in the out
come of the race.
Great interest was manifested all along
the water front yesterday . in the sailing
of the two" llmejulcers Crocodile and
Lock Torridon, which passed out through
the Golden Gate at the same hour, both
bound for Liverpool.'. Both , vessels are
four-masted barks and both belong to
the class with painted ports. Both were
in fine condition and the race will be. a
keen one. The Crocodile is 2553 tons bur
den and is in command of Captain -W.
Wilson. She was towed to sea by the
tug Defiance. The Lock Torridon is 2081
tons burden and is commanded by Cap
tain R. Pattman. She was towed out
by the Sea King. The sight of two ships
putting to sea at the same time Is not
unusual, but the sight of two vessels of
the same style, class and build, laden
with the same kind of cargo and bound
for the same port is an occurrence which
rarely happens in any: harbor.

ARRIVED.
I At 1 noon yesterday the bridge over the
entrance to the lagoon at ; Tlburon was
raised, and the yach'ts" of the Corinthian
fleet began to (pass into r winter quarters.
The first yacht to pass under the up
raised : drawbridge l was Frank E.- Baker's
sloop Emille in charge of Frank A. Bart
lett. She 1 was followed by the sloops El
sie, Phoenicia, Emma, Clara, Freda,
Fleeting, May, Truant, Edna. Genesta,
the; yawl Frolic,, the sloops Amlgo, Mlg
non. Sans Souci, Villain, Merope, Aeolus,
Ruby, Discovery and Wawona, . The
yachts were followed by the arks Atlan
tis, Bat, Caspian* and four, others. The
ark Atlantis fouled the entrance and
some planks had " to" be cut away to en
able her to I pass , through." The launch
Leona, with Tom Jennings' and Hawkins 1
launches did good, service In towing the
yachts into the lagoon.
The sloops Cupid, Hiawatha and Nep
tune of the Corinthian Yacht Club and
the sloop Juanlta of the San Francisco
Yacht Club also entered the lagoon. The
bridge was raised under the supervision
of Port Captain John H. Keefe.
The yawl Seven Bells and the sloops
Thelma and Nixie are still at their moor-
Ings In Belvedere Cove, but will be taken
up on the ways at South San Francisco
for the winter.
The sloops' Harpoon and Presto were
hauled, out on Frank Stone's ways near
the Fulton Iron Works a week ago. The
yawl Phyllis has been taken up Peta
luma Creek and the sloops Belle and Jo
sie will be sheltered from the storms of
winter in Corto Madera Creek.
the parly morning tides are given in the left
band column and the successive tides of the
day In the order of occurrence as to time; the
fourth time column gives the last tide of the
day, except when there are but three tides, as
sometimes occurs. The heights given are In
addition to the soundings of the United States
Coast Survey charts, except when a minus (â )
sign precedes the height, and then the number
given is subtracted from the depth given by
the charts. The plane of reference Is the mean

Oldfield searched In vain for a police
man, but could find none. He said he
was willing to be arrested himself if it
would do anything toward bringing the
three toughs to justice. The daring mo
torist has two badly, swollen hands as a
souvenir â¢ of the encounter, but says he
will let the matter drop and will not
bother about having the hoodlums ar
reeted. V.:.;]
A large crowd had gathered and great
excitement prevailed. The mob seemed
to be In sympathy with the defeated trio
and threatened to wreck the two automo
biles and wreak ita vengeance upon the
victors In the fray. The two ladies in
the Oldfield party were badly frightened
and mortified at tha publicity the affair
created.
Alexander In the meantime was having
his hands full with the two remaining
members of the buggy party. He shouted
to Oldfleld for aid and Oldfleld responded
With a hard punch he laid out one of the
roughs, and a second later Alexander fln
iehed the other. Then the man whom
Oldfield had tackled first rushed to the
scene and was Just In time to receive a
punch from the champion motorist that
laid him low.
It was Oldfleld's lot to be pitted against
the largest of the three men. and he
made a merry set-to for a few minutes.
Finally the motorist ran his man down
the street, punching him all the while,
till the latter was nearly exhausted.
CBOWD DEMONSTRATIVE.
Oldfleld then slowed up and the three
men in the rig came abreast of the auto
party. They began to use foul and abus
ive language and threatened to wreck the
two machines.
Their threats angered Oldfleld and Alex
ander, and seeing that the only way out
of the difficulty was to right, they climbed
out of the machine and made a rush for
the buggy. The three men were Just get
ting but and they attacked the auto
mobiliats.
He shouted to Oldfleld to stop, but the
motorist, anxious to avoid trouble, paid
no attention to the signal. But Graham
was suffering intense pain and he cried
out to Oldneld for aid and at the same
time applied the brakes to the racing ma
chine.
Oldfield and his friends were going along
at a slow rate and in front of them was
a party of three men in a buggy, all
slightly under tbe influence of liquor. Old
field's machine eoon overtook the rig and
it seemed to anger Its occupants.
The men In the buggy quickened their
horse's pace and as they came abreast of
Graham one of them deliberately struck
the latter across the face with a whip.
It was an ugly cut and caused Graham to
cry out with pain.

It has been the custom in the month of/
November for a number of years for
Nathan-Dohrmann Co. to place on exhi
bition at their salesroom on Sutter street
an interesting display of dinner appoint
ments arranged upon tables for the ben-'
efit of their patrons and friends. Im
provements* have been made since last
year, making more room and allowing
the goods to be displayed to a better
advantage.
These exhibits are always largely at
tended and have been of great interest to
those housekeepers who are desirous of
new ideas for the beautifying of their
dining-room.
Â« This year's display is the most elabo
rate of all and the arrangements of
China, Rock Crystal. Silverware, Lights
and Flowers are exceedingly attractive.
A few moments spent sight seeing
these i days at Nathan-Dohrmann's will
be time well spent.
A Beautiful Thanksgiving Display.
Nelson reported the matter to the Har
bor police station and detectives were at
once detailed on the case. The brave sea
man was then taken to the Harbor Hos
pital, where an ugly wound on- his right
arm was dressed.
Knud Nelson, a seaman on board the
schooner Stofen, lying in the stream at
the foot of Third street, had a fight with
a gang of bay pirates last night. The
thugs were engaged in robbing the
schooner Champion, which was lying
alongside the Stofen, when Nelson ob
served, theml He succeeded In driving
them away single-handed, but received an
ugly gash in the right arm from a knife
wielded by one of the gang.
Nelson was standing on the deck of the
Stofen when he observed four men row
ing over to the Champion. No one was
aboard the boat at the time, and when
the pirates made for the captain's cabin
Nelson's suspicions were aroused. He
quickly climbed aboard the Champion and
caught the band in the act of ransacking
the captain's cabin. He jumped into the
midst of the pirates and began to use
his lists with telling effect. Finally one
of the thugs pulled a knife and cut Nel
son on the arm. The seaman kept on
fighting, however, and managed to rout
the band.
There was the usual Jam at the Or
pheum last night. Those who composed
the crowd were not disappointed at the
show. Not only the holdovers, but the
new features on the programme pleased
the audience immensely and were award
ed by the true old Orpheum stamping and
hand-claps. Truth is that the holdovers
were better than the new specialties and
deserve to be held over for a good week
more at least.

The man behind me shed a cynical
"Marvelous!" after each of Herrmann's
tricks last night. The gentleman evident
ly felt that he had to say something.
Like the rest of us, however, he kept his
mouth open while Herrmann burned up
a charming damsel in a paper torture
chamber, and so on. But "she"â as Billy
Van would say â was with him, and you
couldn't expect him. under the circum
stances to acknowledge that be was fooled
by a mere magician.
Herrmann the Great, however, succeeds
in fooling- all of the people most of the
time. That they enjoy it was evident
from the good house that turned up at
the California last night. There is some
thing delightful in these strenuous days
in seeing a man pick dollars from the
air, hook live fish from the carpet, ex
tract a rabbit from a handful of paper
shavings. Most of these stunts, of course,
have been done before, as well as the
wizard palming and sleight-of-hand, in
which Herrmann excels. But there is
much new, and the rest â In spite of the'
first great Herrmann's wife's naively ex
pressed opinion of her nephew's workâ is
all good.
Chief among the new illusions is the
"levitation" of the Princess Mahomeda.
Even the man behind gave it up. So
did I. The orientally named lady, enters
on a stage prepared for her reception with
a black screen against which Is placed a
small couch. The wizard walks around
this, then places the princess upon It.
She lies down. Then, with -the usual
hocus-pocus of passes, the wizard lifts
his. wand and the lady lifts with it. Grad
ually she rises to a height of perhaps
three feet from the couch, suspended ap
parently in air. The wizard walks around
her again, his figure seen plainly between
her and the screen. Then, as climax,
Herrmann takes a common wooden hoop
and encircles the princess with it, pass
ing it from her head to her feet, appar
ently completely demonstrating that
there is no support for the suspended
figure. The illusion is quite the best . of
its kind seen here. Another almost as
good is where a figure is made to dis
appear through a mirror. All the chil
dren should see the show, that goes only
for the week. â¢ ' . 'Â¦>

they heard the shot. Turning, they say
they saw a woman rush along Kearny
street in the direction of the bay and a
man come down Green street toward
them, but on the other side of the street.
The man ran as far as Dupont street,
then turned and was' lost to sljrht. The
statement of these three persons was all
the detectives were able to secure last
night. To-day the investigation will, be
continued.
Why Migalo was killed is a perplexing
question. He was a bootblack, about 40
years of age. and lived with his 17-year
old son at 15 Reed place. He had been
in this country but two years, and had a
wife and four other children in Italy.
He conducted a stand on Fourth street
and was always regarded as a peaceable
man. His eon states that he had no ene
mies and that he was a member of no
secret organizations. The boy was work-
Ing all day and does not know when his
father -left home or where he went. Rob
bery could not have been a motive, as a
purse and sack containing $68 were found
in his pockets and no effort had been
made to take thenvout.
The bullet struck Migalo In the fore
head and came out the back of his head.
It ranged upward and there are powder
marks on the face showing that the shot
was fired at close range. There Is a dis
position on the part of the Italians to
keep the matter quiet and an air of
mystery Is maintained by all who have
been questioned. The police believe that
the crime was deliberately planned, and
that the bootblack was lured to his death.
There is another story current that the
murder was the result of some trouble
that occurred at the corner of Dupont and
Green streets a short, time before the
shooting and that four men were seen
following Migalo to the scene of his death.
Witnesses, however, are lacking, but the
Investigation to-day probably will bring
all the facts to light.
Prospero Migalo, an Italian bootblack,
was mysteriously murdered shortly be
fore midnight last night. The crime was
committed at the corner of Green and
Kearny streets, and there la no clew as
to its perpetrator. Migalo was j shot in
the forehead, toppled to the street and
died Instantly. Three witnesses are de
tained by Detectives Ed O'Dea and George
Mulcahy, who have the case In charge.
The witnesses claim to have seen people
running from the scene of the crime and
two of them implicate a woman.
M. Baldocche, who runs a fruit stand at
the corner of Union street and Montgom
ery, avenue, was first to notify Policeman
Mattherson of the crime. He refused to
give his name and was taken to the Hall
of Justice. When questioned he said
that he was standing at the corner of
San Antonio place and- Vallejo street
when he eaw, a man rush out of the first
named thoroughfare from Green street
and continue In the direction of Dupont.
Baldocche then became reticent and the
police are positive that he knows a great
deal more of the case than he Is, willing
to tell.
