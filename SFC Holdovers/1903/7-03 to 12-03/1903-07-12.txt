Back In 1850, a young man of 24, he had
joined the rush to California, working his
passage as deckhand on a vessel that
doubled the Horn. Landing without cap
ital at San Francisco, â¢ the little seaport
settlement among the "~; shifting yellow
sand-dunes, he had worked six weeks
along the docks as roustabout for money
to take him back Into - the hills whence
came the big fortunes and the bigger tales
of fortunes. .'Â¦â¢ For six years he worked
over the 'gravelly benches of me Califor
nia creeks for vagrant particles of gold.
Then, In the late fifties, he Joined a mad
stampede to the". Frazer River gold fields
In BrltiHh Â§ Columbia. Tnence, in the
sixties, the mining world being still wild
over its first ! knowledge of silver \ sul
phurets, hÂ« was drawn back to . the won
der tales of the Comstock lode; '.â¢-;'- yr'^vj
times holes In the ground. One abode of
luxury, long cherished in memory, was
a Â¦ ten-by-twelve redwood shanty on
Feather River. It not only boasted a
window, but there was a round bole In
the "shake" roof, fastidiously cut to fit
a stovepipe..- That he. never possessed a
stovepipe had made this .feature of the
architecture not less sumptuous and en
gaging. : He lived chiefly on salt pork
and beans, cooked over smoky campflres.
Through It all he was the determined,
eager, confident prospector, never for an
Instant prey to even the suggestion of a
doubt that he would not shortly be rich.
Whether, he washed the gotuen specks
from the sand of a sace brush plain or
sought the mother ledge of some. wander-
Ing golden child, or dug with his pick to
follow a promising surface lead, he knew
it to be only the matter of time when his
day should dawn. He was of the make
that wears unbending hope as Its birth
right.
Some day the Inexhaustible placer would
be found; or, on a mountainside where
the porphyry was stained, he would care
lessly chip off a fragment of rock, turn
It up to the sun, and behold it rich in

It that to have' gone a few feet to either

picked it up and examined It leisurely.
It was rich in silver.
Somewhere, then, between him and the
mountain top was the parent stock from
which this precious fragment had been
broken. 'The sun beat hotly upon him as

enthusiasm that never faltered.

to do otherwise. He considered It no med
dling, however, to remember that Mrs.
Daniel J. Bines, widow of his late em
ployer, could appear neither young nor
beautiful to the most sanguine of news
gatherers; nor to remember that he hap
pened to know she had not accompanied
her husband on his last trip of Inspection
over t_e Kalso division of the Sierra
Northern Railway. '
. Besides the directions and the telegram
from Toler, Billy Brue took with 'him
a copy of the Bkiplap Weekly l Ledge,
damp from the press and containing the
death notice of Daniel J. Bines, a notice
sent out by the News Association/which
Billy Brue read with Interest as be started
up the trail. The item concluded thus:
"The "young 'and beautiful Mrs. Bine's,
who had been accompanying .her husband
on , his < trip of Inspection over : the Sierra
Northern. Is prostrated ' with grief at the
shock of his sudden death." .
Billy ,. Brue : mastered this piece * of In
telligence after six readings, but he re
frained from ' comment, beyond thanking
God, In thought, that he could mind his
own business under excessive provocation
would have tramped no great distance In
the ten days he had been gone. The
searchers, therefore, were directed to
beat up the near-by country. To Billy
Brue was allotted the easiest as being the
most probable route. He was to follow
up Paddle Creek to Four Forks, thence
over the Bitter â¢Root trail to Eden,
on to Oro Fino and up over Lit
tle Pass to Hellandgone. . He was
to proceed slowly, to be alert for signs
along the way, and to make inquiries of
all he met. *
"You're likely to get track of Uncle
Peter," said Pangburn, . "over along the
west side of Horseback Ridge, Just be
yona Eden. When he pulled out he was
talking about some likely floatrock he'd
picked up over that way last summer.
YouM-ought to make that by to-morrow,
seeing you've got a good horse and the
trail's been mended this spring. Now you
spread yourself out, Billy, and when you
get on to the Ridge make a special look
all around there." -,
It was thus Billy Brue found him at the
end of his second day's search. A little
off the trail, at the entrance to a pocket
of the canyon, he towered erect to peer
down when he heard the noise of the mes
senger's ascent. Standing beside thÂ© bowl

of the gnarled dwarf cedars, his hat off.

And so he loitered through the moun
tains, resting here, climbing there, mak
ing, always a shrewd, close reading of the
recks. .
Each spring the old man grew restive
and raw like an unbroken colt. And when
the distant mountain peaks began to
swim In their summer haze and the little
rushing rivers sang to him. pleading t&at
he come once more to follow them up, he
became uncontrollable. Every year at
this time he alleged, with a show of irri
tation, that his health was being sapped
by the pernicious Indulgence of sleeping
on a bed Inside a house. He alleged, fur
ther that stocks and bonds were but
shadows of wealth, that the old minea
might any day hecomo exhausted, and
that security for the future lay only in
having one member of the family, at
least, looking up new pay-rock against
the ever possible time of adversity.
"They alnt got to makln' calendars yet

would say. "A'most any one of them In

When he did go It was always under

two weeks. A list of his reasons for ex
tending the time each year to three or
four months would constitute the Ideal
monograph on human duplicity. When
hard pushed on bia return, he bad once or
twice been even brazen enough to assert
that he had lost his way in the mountain
fastnesses. But, for all his protestations,
no one when he left in June expected to
see him again before September at the
earliest. In these solitary tours he was
busy and happy. ~ working and playing.

CHAPTER L *
THE SECOND GENERATION IS RE
MOVED.
WHEN Daniel J. Bines died of
apoplexy In his private car at
Kaslo Junction no one knew
Just where to reach either his
old father or his young son
viith the news of his death. Somewhere
up the eastern elope of the Sierras the old
man would be leading, as be bad long
chosen to lead each summer, the lonely
life of a prospector. The young man.
tv. j years out of Harvard and but recent
ly back from an extended European tour,
was at some point on the North Atlantic
coast, beginning the season's pursuit of
happiness as he listed.
Only in a land eo young that almost the
present dwellers therein have made It
might we find Individualities which so de
cisively failed to blend. So little con
gruous was the family of Bines in root,
branch and blossom that it might, in
deed, be taken to picture En epic of West
ern life as the romancer would tell it.
First of the line stands the figures of
Feter Bines, the pioneer, contemporary
with the Etirrlr.gr days of Fremont, of Kit
< arton, of Harney and Bridger. the fear
less Etrlvers toward an ever-receding
West, fascinating for Its untried dangers
f.s for Its fabled wealthâ the sturdy, grave
men who fought and tolled and hoped,
end realized In varying measure, but who
led In sober truth a life such as the col
ors of no tale-teller shall ever be high
enough to reproduce.
Next came Daniel J. Bines, a type of
the builder said organizer who followed
the trail blazed by the pioneer; the genius
who, finding the magic realm opened,
forthwith beeamt Its exploiter to Its vast
renown and his own large profit, coining
Its wealth of minerals, lumber, cattle and
grain, and adventurously building the
railroads that must always be had to
'drain a new land of savagery.
Nor, would there be wanting a thirdâ a
figure, of this present day, containing In
potency at least the stanch qualities of
his two rugged forbearsâ the venturesome
spirit that set bis restless grandslre to
roving westward, the power to group and
co-ordinate, to "think three moves
ahead.** which bad made his father a man
ef affairs: and. further, he had something
modern of his own that neither of the
ethers possessed, and yet which came as
the Just fruit of the parent vine; a dispo
sition perhaps a bit lees strenuous. turn-
Ins back to the risen rather than forward
to the setting eun; a tendency to rest a
llttls from the toll and tumult; to culti
vate some graces subtler than those of
adventure and commercialism; to make
the most of what had been done rather
than strain to the doing of needless more;
to live. In short, like a philosopher and a
ffentlezcan who has more golden dollars
a year than either philosophers or gentle
men are wont to enjoy.

Penniless and constrained to a life of
privation, Peter Bines had been strangely
happy. Rich and of consequence to a
community where the ways were all of
pleasantness and peace. Peter Bines be
came restless, discontented, and. at last,
unmistakably miserable.
"It can't be because I'm rich, he ar
gued; "It's a sure thing my money can't
keep me from doin' Jest what I want tÂ»
do." t
Then a suspicion pricked him: for he
had, in his years of solitude, formed the
habit of considering. In a leisurely and
hospitable manner, even the reverse sides
of proposition* that are commonly ac
cepted by men without Question.
"The money can't prevent me from
doin' what I Jest want toâ certainâ but,
maybe, don't It? If I didn't have It I'd
fur sure be back In the hills and happy,
and so would Evalina. that ain't had
hardly what you could call a good day
Bince we mada the strike."
On this line of reasoning tt took Peter
Bines no long time to conclude that he
ought now to enjoy as a luxury what he
had once been constrained to as a ne
cessity.
"Even when I was poor and had to hit
the trail I Jest loved them hills, so why
ain't, it crafty to pike back to 'em now
when I don't have to?"
His triumphant (male was:
""When you come to think about It, a
rich man ain't really got any more ex
cuse fur beln* mls'able than a poor man
has!"
Back to the big hills that called him he
had gone; away from the cities where
people lived "too close together and too
far apart"; back to the green, rough
earth where the air was free and quick
and a man could see a hundred miles, and
the people lived far enough apart to be
neighborly. â
There content had blessed him again;
content not slothful but Indtlns; a con
tent that embraced his own beloved
West, fashioning first In fancy and then
by deed its own proud future. He nad
never ceased to plan and stimulate
Its growth. He not only became one
with its manifold Interests, but
proudly dedicated the younc Daniel to Its
further making. He became an ardent
and bigoted Westerner, with a scorn for
the East so profound that no Easterner's
scorn for the West hath ever by any
chance equaled It.
Prospecting with the simple outfit of
eld became bis relaxation, bis sport, and,
as he aged, bis hobby. It was said that
he haa exalted prospecting to "the dignity
of an art, and no longer hunted gold as a
pot hunter. He was even reputed to have
valuable deposits . "covered" . and certain
It Is that after Oeede made his rich find
on Mammoth Mountain In 1890. Peter
Bines met him in Denver and gave him
particulars about the vein which as yet
Creede had divulged to no one. Ques
tioned later concerning this, Peter Bines
evaded answering directly, but suggested
that a man who already had plenty of
monÂ«y might have done wisely to covet
up the find and be still about It: that Nat
Creede himself proved as much by going
crazed over his wealth and blowing out
his brains.

the pines before him, his bead and broad
Ehoulders In the easy poise of power,
there was about him from a little distance
no sign of age. His lines were gracefully
full, his bearing bad still the alertness of
youth. One must have come as near as
Billy Brue now came to detect the marks
of time in his face. Not of ageâ merely
of time: for here was no senility, no
quavering of fretful lines. The gray eyes
shone bright and clear from far under
the heavy, unbroken l!ne of brow, and
the mouth was still straight and firmly
held, a mouth under sure control from
corner to corner. A little had the years
brought out the rugged squareness of the
<hin and the deadly set of the Jaws: a
little had they pressed in the cheeks to
throw the hlch bonfs into broad relief.
Eut these were the utmost of their de
vastations. Otherwise Peter Bines showed
hi* 74 years only by tne marks of a well
ordered maturity. His eyes. It It true,

young seems always to betoken the futil

Tver* kind eyes, and humorous, with many
of the small lines of laughter at their
corners. Reading the ey^s and mouth to-
Beth^r one perceived gentleness and stern
ness to hÂ« well matched, working to any
given end in amiable and effective com
promise. "Uncle Peter" he had long been
called by the public that knew him. and
his own erandchUdren had come to call
him by the same term, finding him too
young to meet their Ideal of a grand
father.
Billy Brue. riding up the trail, halted,
nodded, and was silent. The old man re
turned his salutation as briefly. These
things by men who stay much alone come
to be managed with verbal economy. They
would talk presently, but greetings were
awkward.
Billy Brue took one foot from Its stir
rup and turned in his saddle, nulling the
ler up to a restful position. Then hÂ«* spat,
musingly, and looked hark down the
canyon aimlessly, throwing his eyes from
plde to fide, whpre the gray pranlte ledgfs
showed through the tall spruce and pine
trees.
But the old man knew he had been sent
for.

Billy Brue snufrm*>d In th^ saddle. sp*t
egaln, as with sudden resolve, and said:
"Whyâ uhâ Pan'l J.â he's dead."
The old man repeated the words, dazed
ly-
"Dan'l J.â he's dead;â why, who else is
dead, too?"
IMIly Bru?'s emphasis, cunnincly con
trivd by h'm to avoid pivinR prominence
to the word "dead." had suiriaregtÂ«Â»d this
inquiry In the first moment of stupefac

"N'rbody else deadâ Jest Dan'l J.â he's

Billy Brue turnrd from the stony inter
rogation of bis eyes and took a fpw steps
sway, wilting. A lit'lp wind sprang up
among the higher trees, the moments
passed, and still the Rreat fljrure stood
transfixed in Its curious silence. The
lfathers creaked as the horse turned. The
messenger, with an air of surveying the
canyon, stole an anxious glance at the
old face. The sorrowful old eyes were
fixed on thlnps that were not; they looked

"But all he'd ever say was that times
had changed since my day, and I wasn't
to mind him."
He had himself better in hand now.
"Why, I nursed that boy when he was
a dear, funny little red baby with big
round eyes rollln' around to take notice;
he took notice awful quickâ fur a baby.
Oh, my! Oh, dear! Dan'l!"
Again he stopped.
"And it don't eeem more'n yesterday
that I was a-teachin' him to throw the

none; Dan'l J. was a .man, nowâ" He
haind once more.
"The dead millionaire," began Billy
Brue, reading from the obituary in the
Skiplap Weekly Ledge, "was in his flfty

it says, Billy? Any one with him?"
"Why, this here dispatch is signed by

"Nobody else?"
The old man was peering at him
sharply from under the gray protruding
brows.
"Well, If you must know, Uncle Peter,
this Is what the notice says that come by
wire to the Ledge office," and he read
doggedly:
"The young *nd beautiful Mrs. Bines,
who had been accompanying her husband
on his trip of Inspection over the Sierra
Northern, is prostrated by the shock of
bis sudden death."
The old man' became for the first time
conscious of the tears In his eyes, and.
pulling down one of the blue woolen shirt
sleeves, wiped his wet cheeks. The slow,
painful blush of age crept up across the
iron strength of his face and passed. He
looked away as he spoke.
"I knew It: I knew that. My Dan'l was

They turned back dow.n the trail, the

In the parlor a few ornamental books
were grouped with rare precision on the
center table with its oval top of white
marble. On the walls ..of the "sitting
room" were a steel engraving of Abra
ham Lincoln striking the shackles from
a kneeling slave, and a framed cardboard
rebus worked In red zepl'yr. the reading
of which was "No Croes, No Crown."
Thus far noth.ng helpful has been
found.
Let us examine, then, the what-not In
the "â¢ittlng-room" and the choice Em
pire cabinet that faces it from the oppo
site wall of the parlor.
The what-not as an American institu
tion is obsolete. Indeed, it has be*n rath
er long since writers referred to It even
in terms of opprobrious sarcasm.
The what-not, once the cherished Â«hrlne
of the American home, sheltered the
smaller household goods for which no oth
er resting place could be found. The Em
pire cabinet, with Its rounding front of
glass, its painted Watteau scenes and Its
mirrored back, has come to supplant the
humbler creation In the fulfillment of all
Its tender or mysterious offices.
Here, perchance, may be found a claw
in symbol to the family strife.
The Bines what-not in the sitting-room
was grimly orthodox in its equipment.
Here was an ancient box covered with
shell m'ork, with a wavy little mirror in
its back; a tender motto worked with the
hair of the dead; a "Rock of Agss" In a
glass case, with a garland of pink chenille
around the base; two dried pine cones
brightly varnished; an old daguerreotype
in an ornamental case of haru rubber; u.
small old album; two small Chins vu*4f
of the kind that came always In paJrs,
standing on mats of crocheted worsted;
three sea uhells, and the cup and st-ucer
that belonged to gtandma, which no one
must touch because they'd beÂ«n broken
and were held together but weakly, ow
ing to the imperfections of homÂ«-made
c< ment.
The new cabinet, haughty in Us var
nished elegance.' with Us Watteau dames
and courtiers, and perhaps the. knowledge
that it enjoys widespread approval among
the electâ this is a different matter. In ev
ery American home that is a home to-tlay
it demands attention. The visitor, alter
e>lSC it with cautious side glances, goes
jauntily up to it, affecting to have been
stirred by the mere Impulse of elegant
Idleness. Under the affectedly care. ess
scrutiny of the hostess he fall* dramati
cally into an attitude of awed entrance*
ment. Reverently he gazes tyon the
priceless, bibelots within: the. mother-of
pearl fan, haif open; the tiny cup and
saucer, of Sevres on their brass ta*el: the
miniature Cupid and Psyche In marble;
the Japanese wrestlers carved In ivory;
the ballet-dancer in bisque; tht coral
necklace; the -souvenir spoon from the
Pans Exposition; the Jade bracelet: and
the. silver snuff-box that grandfather car
ried to the day of his death. If the gaz

character hC makes humorous pretense
that thv householder has done wisely to
turn a key upon these treasures, against

- The young man, not without embarrass
ment drew forth a Russia leather caM
cdse which the old man took from him as
one havlnsr authority.
"Here you are, Marthy Bines!" he ex
claimed, handing her a card: "here you
are! reau It! 'Mr. P. Percival Bines.' *<ow
don't you feel proud of havin' stuck out
for Pflrdval when you pee it In cold
print? You know mighty well his pa and
me agreed to Percival only fur a middle
name. Jest to please youâ and he wa'n't
to be called by.itâ only Jest Peter or 'Peter
P.", at most: and .now look at the way
he's gone and garbled his good name."
Mr. P. Percival Bines blushed furiously
here, but ; rejoined, 1 nevertheless, with
quiet dignity, that a man's name was
something about which he should have
the ruling voice, especially where It was
possible for him to rectify or conceal the
unhappy choice of his parents.
"And while we're on names," he con
tinued, "do try to remember In case you
ever get among people, that Sis' name Is
Psyche ar.d not Pish."
The blonde and complacent Mies Bines
here moved uneasily In her patent blue
plush rocker and spoke for the first time,
with a grateful glance at her brother.
"Yes. Uncle Peter, for mercy's sake, do
try! Don't ma*Â« us a laughingstock !"
"But your name Is Pish. A person's
namÂ« Is what their folks name 'em, alnt
It? Your ma comes acrost a name In a
book that shÂ« likes the looks of. and she
takes it to spell ?ish, and she ups and
names you Pish, and we all calls you
Pish and Plsby, and then when you tod
dle off to public school and let 'em know
how you spell it they tell you it's some
thing elseâ an outlandish name If spellin'
means anything. If it comes tp that you
ought to change the spellln' Instead of
the name that your poor pa loved."
Yet the old man had come to know that
he was fighting a lost fightâ lost before it
had eper begun. â¢
"If* will be a good chance." ventured
Mrs. Bines, timidly, "for Pishyâ I mean
Slkeâ Slckyâ to meet the right sort of
people."
"Yee. I should sayâ and the wrong sort.
The ingHgln' host of them lady and gen
tlemen dogs, fur Instance."
"But Uncle Petrr," broke In the young
man. "you shouldn't expect a girl of
Psyche's beauty and fortune to vegetate
In Montana City all her life. Why, any
sort of brilliant marriage is possible to
her If she goes among the right people.
Don't you want the family to amount to
something socially? Is our money to do
us no rood? And do you think I'm going
to stay here and be n moss-hack and raJst*
chin whiskers and work myself to death
the way my father did?"
"No, no," replied the old man, with a
glance at the mother; "not Jest the way
your pa did; you might do different and
some better: but all the came, you won't
do any better'n he did any way you'll
learn to live in' New York. Unless you
was to go broke there." he added,
thoughtfully: "In that case you got the
stuff In you and lt'd come out; but you
got too much money to go broke."
"And you'll *ee that I lead a decent

my father was a young man."
"Yes: that's what your pa told meâ

he'd 'a' listened."

hardest times of the soft material luxu

lesi marked in his character, too, was
the slightly relaxed tension of his
father; the disposition to feast as
well as the capacity to fast; to
take all. feel all, do all, with an avidity
greater by reason of the grinding absti
nence and the later indulgence of his
forbears. A sage versed In the lore of
heredity as modified by environment may
some day trace for us the progress across
this continent of an austere Puritan,
showing how the strain emerges from the
wilderness at the Western ocean with a
character so widely differing from the one
with which he began the adventurous
Journeyâ regarding, especially, a tolerance
of the so-called good and many of the bad
things of life. Until this is done we may,
perhaps, consider the change to be wlth-
to the Cfcrelem Creek smel

that a new herd of Gallows
had done finely last season on
the Bitter Root branch: that
a big lot of ore was sacked at

een-inch vein had been struck
In the Old Crow; that a con
centrator was needed at Hell
antlgone. and that rich gold
bearing copper and sand-bear
ing free gold had been found
over on Horseback Ridge.
Another day they would
drive far into a forest of
spruce and hemlock to a camp
where thousands of ties were
being cut and floated down to
the line of the new railway.

"Dan'l!" he said.
It was not a cry: there was nothing
plaintive in it. It was only the old man
calling his eon; David calling upon Absa
lom. Then there was a change. He came
sternly forward.
"Who killed my boy?"
"Nobody. Uncle Peter; 'twas a strok*.
He was goin' over the line and they laid
out at Kaslo fer a day so's Dan'l J. could
see about a spur the 'Lucky Cuss' people
wantedâ and maybe It was the cllmbln'
brought It on."
The old man looked his years. As he
cam* nearer Billy Brue saw tears tremble
in his eyes and roll unnoted down his
cheeks. Yet his \olce was unbroken and
he was, indeed, unconscious of the tears.
"I was afraid of that. He lived too
high. He et too much and he drank too
much and was too softâ was Dan'lâ too
softâ"
The old voice trembled a bit and he
stopped to look aside into the little pocket
he had been exploring. Billy Brue looked
back down the- canyon where the swift
stream brawled itself into white foam far
below.
"He wouldn't use his legs; I prodded
him about it constantâ"
He stopped to brace himself against the
shock. Billy Brue still looked away.
"I told him high altitudes and high
tlvln' would do any manâ" Again he was
â¢UtBt,
Billy.
Already, such was* his buoyance and
habit of quick recovery and readjust
ment under reverses^ his thoughts were
turning 1 to his grandson. Daniel's boy
there was the grandson of his grandfather
âthe son of his father-fresh from col
lege, and the Instructions of European
travel, knowing many things hi? father
had not known, ready to take up the work
of his father, and capable, perhaps, of
giving it a better Hnish. *..Â» *>*-<Â£*Â°

It did not occur to him that he and the
boy miKht be as far apart in sympathies
and aim* a* at that moment they were
in circumstance. For. while the old man
in the garb of â¢ penniless prospector,
tolled down the steep mountain trail on a
cheap horse, his grandson was reading the
first news of his father's death in one of
the luxurious staterooms of a large steam
yacht that had Just let down her anchor
in Newport Harbor. And each-but tor
the death-had been where most he wished
to be-one with his coarse fare and out-of

and Irreconcilable.

' Young Bines, at all events, was th4
flower of a pioneer stock, and him the
gods of life cherished, so that all the
forces of the young land about him were
as his own. Yet, though his pulses rhymed
to theirs, he did rot perceive his relation
to them; neither he nor the land was yet
become Introspective. So Informed was
he with the Impetuous spirit of youth that
the leant manifestation of life found Us
answering thrill In him. And it was suf
ficient to feel this. There was no time
barren enough of sensation to reason
about it.
Uncle PetÂ«r's plan for an inspection of
the Bines praperties had at first won him
by touching his sense of duty. He antici
pated no interest or pleasure in the trip.
Yet from the beginning he enjoyed it to
the full. Being what he was. the constant
movement pleased him, the out-of-docr*
life, the occasional sorties from the rail
road by horse to some remote mining
camp, or to a stock ranch or lumber
camp. He had been away for six years,
and It Dleased him to note that he was
treated by the people he met with a genu
ine resDect and liking as the son of his
father. In thÂ« East he had been accus
tomed to a certain deference from very
uncertain people because he was the son
of a rich man. Lere he had prestige be
cause he was the son of Daniel Bines, or
ganizer and man of affairs. He felt some
times that. the men at mine, mill or ranch
looked him over with misgiving, and had
their cautious liking compelled only by
camps off the railroad, where

such as:
"The Hon. Peter Bines and

Or it might be:
"Poker stacks continue to

CHAPTER IV.
THE WEST AGAINST THE EAST.
Two months later a sectional war was
raging in the Bines home at Montana
City The West and the Kast were met n
conrtict-the old and the new. the stale
and the fresh. And. if the bittern*, was
dissembled by the combatants, not less
keenly was it felt, nor less determined
was either faction to be relentless.
A glance about the "sitting-room
In which the opposing forces were
lined up. and into the parlor
through the opened folding doors,
may help us to a better under
standing of the issue involved.
Both rooms were large and fur
nished in a style that had been
supremely luxurious in 1878.
The house, built in that
year, of Oregon pine, had
been quite the most preten
tious piece of architecture
Jn that section of the West.
It had been erected in the
first days of Montana City
as a convincing testimonial
from the owner to his faUh
in the town'B future. The
plush-upholstered sofas and
chairs, with their backs and
legs of carved black walnut,
had come direct from New
York. For pictures there
were early art chromos,

prized companion pieces.

ble sequence, and a superiority of indif
ference to each was the only protection
against hurts from the unexpected.
This trained neutrality of Mrs. Bines
served her finely now. 8he had no lead-
Ing to ally herself against her children In
their wish to go East, nor against Uncle
Peter Bines In his stubborn effort to keep
' them West. She folded her hands to wait
on the others.
And thÂ« battle rased.
The old man. sole defender of the vir
tuous and stalwart West against an East
that he alleged to be effete and depraved,
had now resorted to sarcasmâa i thing
that Mr. Carlyle thought was as good as
the language of the devil. Â¦ .
"And here, now, how about this dog
luncheon?" he continued,, glancing at a
New York newspaper clutched accusingly
in his hand. "It was give, I see, by one
of your Newport cronies. Now, that's

believe, is the name of it?" he ended in
polite inquiry.
"There, there. Uncle Peter!" the young
man broke In, soothingly; "you mustn't
take those Sunday newspapers as gospel
truth; those stories are printed for Just
such rampant old tenderfoots as you are;
and even if there Is one foolish freak,
he ciotbii't represent all society in the bet
ter sense of the term."
"Yes, and you!" Uncle Peter broke out
again, reminded of another grievance.
"You know well enough your true name
is Peterâ Pete and Petle when you was a
baby and Peter when you left for college.
And you're ashamed of what you've dona,
too, for you tried to hide them callin'

umphs? Why is it that they Immediately
puck their carpetbags, take the first

the Investing, public by the manner In
which they bull the price of New York

The old man listened absently.
"And probably some day I'll read of
you In that same center of culture and
distinction as P. Percival Bines, a young
man of obscure fam'ly. that rose by his
own efforts to be the dashln' young co
tillon leader and the wtill-known club
man, and that his pink teas fur dogs is
barked about by every fashionable ca
nine on the Island."
. The young man continued to read:
'"These men are not vain fools; they
are shrewd, successful men of the world.
They have surveyed New York City from
a distance and have discovered that, in
spite of Tammany and in spite of yellow
Journals, New York Is a town of un

come; and their coming shows us what
we are. Not only millionaires, but also
painters and novelists and . men and

palpitates with life and ambition and
hope and promise; it attracts the great
and the successful, and those who admire
greatness and success. The force of nat
ural selection Is at work here as every
where; and it is rapidly concentrating in
our small island whatever is finest, most
progressive and best in the American
character."
"Well, now, do me a last favor before
you pike off East," pleaded the old man.
'.'Make a trip with me over the proper
ties. See 'em once any way, and
see a little more of this country and these
people. Mebbe they're better'n you think.
Give me about three weeks or a month,
and then, by Crimlni, you can go off if
you're set on it and be 'whatever !Â¦ finest

CHAPTER V.
Bo tht old man and the young man
the assurance that he was Indeed the son
of Daniel. They left him at these times
with the suspicion that this bare fact
meant enough with them to carry a man
of infelicitous exterior.
He was pleased, moreover, to feel a new
respect for -nele Peter. He observed
that men of all degrees looked up him,
sought and relied upon his Judgment; the
investing capitalist whom they met not
less than the mine foreman: the made
man and the laborer. In the drawing
room at home he had fei>. so agreeably
superior to the old man: now he felt his
own inferiority in a new element, and be
gan to view him with more respect. He
saw him to be the shrewd man of affairs,
with a thorough grasp of detail in every
branch of their Interests: and a deep man.
as well: a little narrow, perhaps, from
his manner of life, but of unfailing kind
ness, and with rather a young man's rad
icalism than an old man's conservatism ;
one who, in an emergency, might be re
lied upon to take the unexpected but ef
fective course.
For hia own part, old Peter Bines
learned in the course of the trip to un
derstand and like his grandson better. At
bottom he dec?dÂ»d the young man to He
sound after all, and he began to make
allowance for his geographical heresies.
The boy had been sent to an Eastern col
lege; that was clearly a mistake, putting
him out of sympathy with the West; and
he had never been made to work, which
was another and graver mistake, "but
he'd do more'n his father ever did if
'twa'n't fur his father's money," the old
man concluded. For he saw In their talks
that the very Eastern experience which
he derided had given the young fellow a
poise and a certain readiness to grasp de
tails in the large that his father bad been
a lifetime In acauiring.
For a month they loitered over the sur
rounding territory In the private car,
gliding through fertile valleys, over bleak
passes, steaming up narrow little canyons
along the down-rushing streams with
their cool shallow murmurs.
They would learn one day that a cross
cut' wai to be started on the Last
Chance, or that the. concentrates of the
True Grit would thereafter be shipped

find a ledge of dollar bills
than ho Is rood whisky this
far oft the main trail. The
late Daniel J. could have told
him as much, and Daniel J.'s
boy. who accompanies Uncle
Peter, will know It hereafter."
The young man felt whole
somely Insignificant at these
and other sisns that he was
taken on sufferance as a son
and a grandson.
He was content that It
should be so. Indeed, there
was little with which he was
not content. That he was
habitually preoccupied, even
when there was most move
ment about them, early be
came apparent to Uncle Peter.
That he was constantly cheer
ful proved the mattes, of his
musings to be pleasant. That
he was proner than moat
youths to serious meditation
Uncle Peter did not believe.
Therefore he attributed the
moods of abstraction to some
matter probably connected
with his project of removing
the family East. It was not
permitted Uncle Peter to
know, nor was his own youth
recent enough for him to sus
pect, the truth. And the mys
tery stayed inviolate until a
day came and went that laid
It bare even to the old man's
eyes.
They awoke one morning to
find the car on a siding at the
One Girl mine. Coupled to It
was another car from an
Eastern road that their train
had taken on some time In the
night Percival noted the car
with interest as he paced be

on the Bines car, told him the other car
had been taken on at Kaslo Junction, and
that it belonged to Rulon Shepler, the
New York financier, who was aboard
with a party of friends.
As Percival and Uncle Peter left their
car for the shaft-house after breakfast,
the occupants of the other car were be
stirring themselves.
From one of the open windows a low
but impassioned voice was exhausting the
current idioms of damnation in sweeping
dispraise of all land-areas north and west
of Fifty-ninth Btreet. New York. ,
Uncle Peter smiled grlmlv. Percival
flushed, for the hidden protestant had ut
tered what were bis own sentiments a
month before.
Reaching the shaft-house they chatted
with Pangburn. the superintendent, and
then went to the storeroom to don
blouses and overalls for a descent into the
mine.
For an hour they stayed underground,
traversing the various levels and drifts,
while Pangburn explained the later de
velopments of the vein and showed them
where the new stoplng had been begun.
CHAPTER VL 4
A MEETING AND A CLASHING Â£
As they stepped from the cage at the
surface Perdval became aware of a group
of strangers between h!m and the open
door of the shaft-houseâ people display
ing in dress and manner the unmistak
able stamp of New York. For part of a
minute, while the pupils of his eyes were
contracting to the light, he saw them but
vaguely. Then, as his eight cleared, be
beheld foremost in the group, beaming
upon him with an expression of pleased
and surprised recognition, the girl whose
face and voice had for nearly half a year
peopled his lover's solitude with fair vis-
Ions and made its silence to be all melody.
Had the encounter been anticipated his
composure would perhaps have failed him.
Not a few of his waking: dreams had
sketched this, their second meeting, and
any one of the ways it had pleased him
to plan It would assuredly have found him
nervously embarrassed. But eo wildly
Improbable was this reality that not the
daringest of bis Imagined happenings had
approached It His thoughts for the mo
ment had been not of her; then, all at
once, the stood before him in the flesh,
and be was cool, almost unmoved. He
suspected at once that her father was the
trim, fastidiously dressed man who looked
as if he had been abducted from a morn
ing stroll down the avenue to his club;
that the plump, ruddy, high-bred wo
man, surveying the West disapprovingly
through a lorgnon, would be her mother.
Shepler he knew by sight, with his big
head, massive shoulders, and curiously
short, tapering body. Some other men
and a woman were scanning the hoisting
machinery with superior looks.
The girl, before starting toward him.
had hardly waited longer than it
took him to eye the group. And then came
an awkward two seconds upon her whose
tact in avoiding the awkward was reputed
%o be more than common.
With her band extended she had ut
tered. "Why. Mr. â " before it flashed
upon her that 6he did not know the name
of the young man ehe ~7as greeting.
The "Mister" was threatening to pro
long itseif into an "r" of excruciating
length and disgraceful flnalitv, an "r"
that is terminated neatly by no one but
hardened hotel-clerks. Then a miner
saved the day. /
"Mr. Bines," he Bald, comlnc up hur
riedly behind Percival with- several speci
mens of ore, "you forgot these."
"-r-r-r. Bines, how do you do?" con-
I eluded the girl with an eye-flash of grati
tude at the humble instrument that had
prevented an undue hiatus in her salu
tation.
They were apart from the others and for
he moment unnoticed.
The voung man took the hand so cor
u.ally offered and because of all the things
ne wished and had bo long waited to Bay,
he said nothing.
"Isn't it Jolly! I am Miss Milbrey," slie
idded in a lower tone, and then, raisins
her voice. "Mamma, Mr. Bines â and
papa," ar.d there followed a hurried and
but half-acknowledged Introduction to
the ether members of the party. And, be
hold! in that moment the young man had
schemed the edifice of all his formless
dreams. For six months he had known
the unsurpassable luxury of wanting and
of knowing what he wanted. Now, all at
once, he saw this to be a world In which
dreams come more than true.
Shepler and the party were to go
through the mine as a matter of sight
seeing. They were putting on outer
clothes from the 6toreroom to protect
them from the dirt and damp.
Presently Percival found himself again
at the bottom of the shaft Durine the
descent of twelve hundred feet he had re
flected upon the curious and interesting
fact that her name should be Milbrey.
He felt dimlr that this circumstance
should be ranked among the most inter
esting of natural phenomenaâ that she
should have a name, as the run of mor
tals, and that it should be one name more
than another. 'When he discovered fur
ther thÂ»t her Christian name was Avice
the phenomenon became stupeniomly be
wildering.
They two were in the last of the party
to descend. On reaching bottom he sep
arated her with promptness and iruile
from two solemn young men, copies of
each other, and they were presently
alone. In the distance they could see the
others following ghostly lamps. From
far off mysterious recesses came the ifcuf
fled musical clink of the sledges oa the
drills. An employe who, had come down
with them started to be their guide.
Percival sent him back.
i "I've Just been through; I can find my
â¢way again."
"Ver* well." eal<S the man. "with the
exception that it don't happen something
âyes?" And he Btayed where he vas.
Down ore of the. cross-cuts they started,
stepping aside to let a car of ore be
pushed along to the shaft â¢
"Do you know." began the girl. "I sun
bo glad to be able to thank you for what
you did that night?" /
"I'm Klad you are able. I was begin
ning to think I should always have those
thanks owing to me."
"I misrht have paid them at the time,
hut It was all so unexpected and so sud
den â it rattled me, quite."
"I thought you were horribly cool
beaded."
â¢*I wasn't.**
"Your manner reduced me to a groom
who opened your carriage door."
"But grooms don't Â«of ten pick strange
ladies up bodily and bear them out of a
pandemonium of waltzing cab horses. I'd
never noticed before that cab horses are
so frivolous and hysterical."
"And grooms know where/to look for
their pay."
They were Interrupted nervously, and
bestowing furtive side looks upon each
other.
"If I'd not seen you," said the girl,
"glanced at youâ beforeâ that evening. I
shouldn't have remembered so well;
doubtless I'd not have recognized you to
day."
"I didn't know you did glance at me,
and yet I watched you every moment of
the evening. You didn't know that, did
you?"
She laughed. ' .
"Of course I knew it A woman has to
note sucn things! without letting it be seen
that she sees."
"And I'd have sworn you never once so
much as looked my way."
"Don't we do It well, though7"
"And In spite of all the time I rave to
a study of your face I lost the detail of it.
I could keep only the effect of its expres
sion and the few tones of your voice I
heard. You know I took those on a record
so I could make 'em play over any time
I wanted to listen. Do you know, that
has all been very sweet to me, my help
ing you and the memory of itâ so vague
and sweet.
"Aren't you afraid we're losing the
others?"
Ehe halted and looked back.
"No; I'm afraid we won't lose them;
come on. you can't turn back now. And
you don't want to hear anything about
mines; it wouldn't be at all good for you,
I'm sure. Quick, down this way. or you'll
hear Pangburn telling some one what a
stopÂ© is. and think what a thins that
would be to carry in your head."
"Really, a 6tope sounds like something
that would 'get you' in the night! I am
afraid!"
Half in his spirit ehe fled with him down
a dimly lighted Incline where men were
working at the rocky wall with sledge and
drill. There was that in his manner
which compelled her quite as literally as
when at their first meeting he had picked
her up in his arms.
As they walked single file through the
narrowing of a drift she wondered about
him. He was Western, plainly. An em
ploye In the mine, probably a manager or
director 'or whatever it was they called
those In authority in mines. Plainly, too,
he was a man of action and a man who
engaged all her instinctive liking. Some
thing in him at once coerced her friendliest
confidence. These were the admissions
ehe made to herself. She divined him,
moreover, to be a blend of boldness and
timidity. He was bold to the point of
telling her things unconventionally, of be
guiling her into remote underground pas
sages away from the party; yet she un
derstood; she knew at once that he was
a determined but unspoiled gentleman;
that under no provocation could he make
a mistake. In any situation of lone
liness she would" have felt safe with himâ
"as with a brother"â she thought Then,
feeling her cheeks burn, s-e turned back
and said:
"I must tell you he was my brotherâ
that manâ that night"
He was eorry and glad all at once. The
sorrow being the lesser and more conven
tional emotion, he started upon an awk
ward expression of it, w-lch she inter
rupted.
"Never mind saying that, thank you.
Tell me something about yourself, now.
I reallv would like to know you. What
do you see and hear and do In this strange
life?"
"There's not much variety," he an
swered, with a convincing droop of de
pression. "For six months I've been see
ing you and hearing youâ seeing you and
hearing you: not much variety in thatâ
nothing worth telling you about"
Despite her natural caution, intensified
by training, she felt herself thrill to the
very evident sincerity of his tones, so that
she had to affect mirth to seem at ease.
"Dear, dear, what painful monotony;
and how manv men have said It since
these rocks were made; and now you say
itâ well, I admit "
"But there's nothing new under the sun,
you know."
"No; not even a new :cuse for plagiar
ism, ia there?"
"Well, you see as long as the same old
thing keeps true the same old way of
telling it will be more or less depended
upon. After a few hundred years of ex
periment, you know, they, hit on the few
est words that tell the most, and every
body uses them because no one can Im
prove them. Maybe the prehistoric cave
gentleman, who proposed to his loved one
with a war club Just back of her left ear,
had some variation of the formula suiting
his simple needs, after he'd got her
home and brought her to and she said it
was 'all so sudden;' and a man can work
in little variations of his own to-day. For
exampleâ"
"I'm sure we'd best be returning."
"For example, I could say, you know,
that for keeping the mind active :-nd the
heart working overtime the memory of
you surpasses any tonic advertised in the
backs of the magazines. Or, that â '\
"I think that's enough: I see you 'could
vary tha formula, in caseâ"
"âhave varied Itâ but don't forget I
prefer the original unvaried. After all.
there are certain things that you can't
tell in too few words. Now, vouâ "
"You stubborn person. Really, I know
all about myself. I asked you to tell me
about yourself^.
"And I began at once to tall you every
thing about myselfâ everything of interest
âwhich is yourself."
"I see your sense of values is
gone,' rjor man. I shall question you.
Now you are & miner, aau I like- men
of action, men who do things: I've
often wondered about you, and, seriously,
I'm glad to find you here doing some
thing. I remembered you kindly, with
real gratitude, Indeed. You didn't seem
like a New Yorfc man either, and I de
cided you weren't Honestly, I am glad
tD find you here at your work In your
miner's clothes. You mustn't think we
forget how to value men 'hat work."
On the point of saying thoughtlessly,
"But I'm not working heroâ I own the
mine," he checked himself. Instead he
began a defense of the man jvho doesn't
work, but who could if he had to. "For
example," he continued, "here we are at
a place that you must be carried over;
otherwise you'd have to wade through a
foot of water or go around that long way
we've come. I've rubber boots on, and
so I pick you up this way " He held
her lightly on his arm and she steadied
herself with a hand between bis shoul
ders.
"And staggering painfully under my
burden, I wade out to the middle 'of this
subterranean lake." He stopped.
"You see, I've learned to do things. I
could pick you up from that slippery street
and put you in your carriage, and I can
pick you up now without wasting words
about it "
"But you're wasting timeâ hurry, please
âand, any way, you're a miner and used
to such things."
He remained standing.
"But I'm not wasting time, and I'm not
a miner in the sense you mean. I own
this mine, and I suppose for the most
part I'm the sort of man you seem to
have got tired of; the man who doesn't
have to do anything. Even now I'm this
close to work only because n.y grandfa
ther wanted me to look over the proper
ties my father left" \
"But hurry, please, and set me down."
. "Not until I warn you that I'm Just as
apt to do things as the kind of man you
thought I was. This is twice I've picked
you up now. Look out for. me; next time
I may not put you down at all."
She gave a low little laugh, denoting un.
ruffled serenity. She was glorying se
cretly In his strength, and she knew his
boldness and timidity were still Justly
balanced. And there was the rather as
tonishing bit of news he had Just given
her. That needed a lot of consideration.
With slow, sure-footed steps he reached
the farther side of the water and put her
on her feet.
"There. I thought I'd reveal the dis
tressing truth about myself while I had
you at my mercy."
"I might have suspected, but I gave the
name no thought Bines, to be sure. You
are .the son of the Bines who died some
months ago. I heard Mr. Shepler and my
father talking about some of your mining
properties. Mr. Shepler thought the 'One
Girl* was such a funny name for your
father to give a mine."
Now they neared the foot of
the shaft where the rest of the
party seemed . to await them. - As
they came up Percival felt himself raked
by a broadside from the maternal lorgnon
that left him all but disabled. The father
glowered at him and asked questions in
the high key we are apt to adopt in ad
dressing foreigners. In the instinctive fal
lacy that any language can be understood
by any one if It be spoken loudly enough.
The mother's manner was a crushing re
buke to the young man for his audacity.
The father's manner was meant to inti
mate that natives of the region In which
they were then adventuring were not
worthy of rebuke, save Euch general re
bukes as may be conveyed by displaying 1
one's natural superiority of manner. The
other members of the party, excepting
Shepler, who talked with Pangburn at a
little distance, took cue from the Milbreys
and aggressively ignored the abductor of
an only daughter. They talked over,
around, and through him, as only may
those mortals whom it hath pleased
heaven to have born within certain areas
on Manhattan Island.
The young man felt like a social out
cast until he caught a glance from Miss
Milbrey. That young woman was etlll
friendly, which he could understand, and
highly amused, which he could not under
stand. While the temperature was at its
lowest the first load ascended. Including.
Miss Milbrey and her parents, a chatty
blonde, and an uncomfortable little man
who, despite his being twelve hundred feet
toward the center thereof, had three
times referred bitterly to the fact that
he was ''out of the world."
"I shall Bee you soon above ground,
shall I not?" Miss Milbrey had asked, at
whfch her mother shot Percival a parting
volley from her rapid-fire lorgnon, while
her father turned upon him a back whose
sidelines were really admirable, consid
ering his age and feeding habits. The be
havior of these people appeared to inten
sify the amusement of their child. The
two solemn young men who remained
continued to chat before Percival as they
would have chatted before the valet of
either. He began to sound the spiritual
anguish of a pariah. Also to feel trucu
lent and, in his own phrase, "Westy."
With him "Westy" meant that you were
as good as any one else "and a shade bet
ter than a whole lot If it came to a show
down." He was not a little mortified to
find how easy It was for him to fall back
upon that old cushion of provincial arro
gance. It was all right for Uncle Peter,
but for himselfâ well. It proved that he
was less finely Eastern than he had im
agined.
As the cage cafne down for another as
cent, he let the two solemn young men go
up with Shepler and Pangburn, and went
to search for Uncle Peter.
"There, thank God, is a man!" he re
flected.
CHAPTER VIL
THE RAPID-FIRE LORGNON IS
SPIKED.
He found Uncle Peter in the crosscut,
studying a bit of ore through a glass, and
they went back to ascend.
"Them folks," said the old man, "must
be the kind that newspaper meant, that
had done something in practical achieve
ment. I bet that girl's mother will achieve
something practical with you fur cuttin'
the girl out of the bunch; she was aw
ful tormented: talked two or three
times about the people in the humbler
walks of life bein' strangely something or
other. You ain't such a humble walker
now. are you, son? But say, that yellow
haired woman, she ain't a bit diffident, is
she? She's a very hearty lady, I must
say!"
"But did you eeo Miss Milbrey?" .
"Oh. that's her name, Is It, the one that
her â¢ mother was eo worried about and
you? Yes, I saw her. Peart and cunnin',
but a heap too wise fur you, son; take my
steer on that. Say, she'd have your pelt
nailed to the barn while you was wonder-
In' which way you'd jump."
"Oh, I know, I'm only a tender, teeth-
Ing infant," the young man answered,
with masterly satire.
"Well, now, as long's you got that bank
roll you Jest look out for cupboard love â
the kind that the old cat has when she
comes rubbln' up against your leg and
purrln' like you was the whole thing.".
The young man smiled as they went up,
with youthVgodllke faith in its own suf
ficiency, aVbeit he smarted from the
Blights put upon him.
At the surface a pleasant shock was in
store for him. There etood the formidable
Mrs, Milbrey beaming upon him. Behind
her was Mr. Milbrey, the pleasing model
of all a city's refinements, awaiting the
boon of a handclasp. Behind these were
the uncomfortable little man, the chatty
blonde, and the two solemn young men
who had lately exhibited more manner
than manners. Percival felt they were
all regarding him. now with affectionate
concern. They pressed forward effusively.
"So good of you, Mr. Bines, to take an
interest in usâ my daughter has been so
anxious to see one of these fascinating
mines." "Awfully obliged, Mr. Bines,"
"Charmed, old man; deuced pally of you
to stay by us down in that hole, you
know." "So clever of you to know where
to find the goldâ"
He lost track of the speakers. Their
speeches became one concerted effusion of
affability that was music to his ears.
Miss Milbrey was apart from the group.
Having doffed the waterproeffs, she' was
now pluming herself with | those fussy
looking but mysteriously potent little
pats which restore the attlro and mind
of women to their normal perfection and
serenity. Epon her face was still the
amused look Percival had noted below.
"And, Mr. Bines, do come in with that
quaint old grandfather of yours and lunch
with us," urged Mrs. Milbrey, who had as
it were spiked her lorgnon. "Here's Mr.
Sheplei to second the invitationâ and then
we shall chat about this very interesting
West."
Miss Milbrey nodded * encouragement,
seeming to chuckle inwardly.
In the spacious dining compartment of
the Shepler car the party was presently
at lunch.
"You seem eo little like a Western man,".
Mrs. Milbrey confided graciously to Per-.,
cival on her righL
"We cal'late he'll fetch out all straight,
though, in a year or so," put in Uncle
Peter, from over his chop, with guileless*
intent to defend his grandson from what
he believed to be an attack. "Of course,
a young man's bound to get some foolish
ness into him in an Eastern college like
this boy went to."
Percival had flushed at the compliment
to himself; also at the old man's failure
to Identify It" as such.
Mr. Milbrey caressed his glass of claret
with ardent eyes and took the situation in
hand with the easy confidence of a mas
ter.
"The West," said he, affably, "has sent
us some magnificent men. In truth, It's
amazing to take count of the Western
men among us In all the professions. They
are notable, perhaps I should say, less for
deliberate niceties of style than for a cer
tain rough directness, but so adaptable is
the American character that one frequent
ly does not suspect theirâ erâ humble ori
gin."
"Meaning their Western origin?" In
quired Shepler, blandly, with secret In
tent to brew strife.
"Wellâ erâ to be sure, my dear fellow,
not necessarily humbleâ of courseâper
haps I should have said "
"Of course, not necessarily disgraceful,
as you say, Milbrey." interrupted Shepler.
"and they often do conceal it. Why, I
know a chap in New York who was posi
tively never cast of Kansas City until he
was 25 or so, and yet that fellow to-day"
âhe lowered his voice to the pitch of lm
pressivenessâ "has over eighty pairs of
trousers and complains of the hardship
every time he has to go to Boston."
"Fancy, now!" exclaimed Mrs. Drelmer,
the blonde. Mr. Milbrey looked slightly
puzzled, and Uncle Peter~chuckled, affirm
ing mentally that Rulon Shepler must be
like one of those tugboats, with* most of
his lines under the surface.
"But, I say, you know, Shepler," pro
tested one of the solemn young men, "he
must still talk like a banjo."
"And gargle all his *r's,' " added the
other, very earnestly. . "They never get
over that, you know."
"Instead of losln' 'era entirely," put In
Uncle Peter, who found himself feeling
what his grandson called "Westy." "Of
course, he calls it 'Ne' Yawk.' and prob'Iy
he don't like It In Boston because they
always call 'em 'rawroystahs.' "
"Good for the old boy!" thought Perci
val, and then, aloud: "It is 'iard for the
West and the East to forgive each other's
dialects: The Inflated 'r' and the smoth
ered 'r* never quite harmonize."
"Western money talks good straight
New York talk." ventured Miss Milbrey,
with the air of one who had observed In
her time. /
Shepler grinned, and the parents of the
young woman resisted* with Indifferent
success their twin impulses to frown.
"But the service is so wrÂ»tchcd In. the
West." suggested Oldaker, the carefully,
dressed little man with the tired, troubled
eyes, whom the world had been deprived
of. "I fancy, now. there's not a good
waiter this side of New York."
"An American," said Percival, "never
can make a good waiter or a good valet.
It takes a Latin, or, still better, a Bri
ton, to feel the servility required for good
service of that sort. An American, now.
always Sails at it because he knows he
Is as good as you are. and he knows that
you know it, and you know that he krowg
you know it. and there you are, two mirrors
of American equality face to face and re
flecting each other endlessly, and neither
is comfortable. The American Is as un
comfortable at having certain cervices
performed for him by another American
as the other is In performing them. Give
him a Frenchman or an Italian or a fel
low born within the Eound of Bow Bells
to clean his boots and lay out his things
and serve his dinner and he's all right
enough."
"Hear, hear!" cried Uncle Peter.
"Fancy, now," said Mrs. Drelmer, "a
creature In a waiter's Jacket having emo
tions of that sort!"
"Our excellent country," said Mr. Mil
brey, "is perhaps not yet what It will be;
there is undeniably a most distressing
rawness where we might expect finish.
Now in Chicago," he continued in a tone
suitably hushed for the relation of occult
phenomena, "we dined with a person who
served champagne with the oysters, soup,
fish, and entree, and for the remainder
of the dinner â you may credit me or not
â he proffered a claret of 1S75 â I need hard
ly remind you. the most deljcato vintage
of the latter half of the centuryâ and It
was 6erved frappe." There was genuine
emotion in the sneaker's voice.
"And papa nearly swooned when our
host put cracked ice and two lumps of
sugar into his own glass â "
"Avice, dear!" remonstrated the father
in a tone Implying that some things posi
tively must not be mentioned at table.
"Well, you shouldn't expect too much of
those self-made men in Chicago," said
Shepler.
"If they'd only make themselves as well
as they make their sausages and things,"
sighed Mr. Milbrey.
"And the self-made man will talk shop,"
suggested Oldaker. "He thinks you're dy
ing to hear how he made the first thou
sand of himself."
"Still, those Chicago chaps learn quickly
enough when they settle In New York,"
ventured one of the young men.
"I knew a Chicago chap who lived East
two vears and went back not a half bad
sort." said the other. "God help him now,
though: his father made him go back to
work In a butcher shop or something of
the sort."
"lost thine I ever heard about Cal
cago," said Uncle Peter, "a man from
your town told me once he had to stay
in Chicago a year and, says he, 'I went
out there a New Yorker, and I went home
an American/ he savs." The old man
completed his anecdote In tones that were
slightly Inflamed.
"How extremely typical!" said Mrs. Mil
brey. "Truly the West Is the place of
unspoiled Americanism and the great un
spent forces: you are . quite" right, Mr.
Bines."
"Think of all the unsment forces back
in that silver mine." remarked Miss Mil
brey, with a patent effort to be signifi
cant.
"My perverse child delights to pose as
a sordid young woman," the fond mother
explained to Percival, "yet no one can be
less so. and you, Mr. Bines, I am sure,
would be the last to suspect her of it.
1 saw In you at once- those sterling qual
ities "
"Isn't it dreadfully dark down in that
Bterling silver mine?" observed Miss Mil
brey, apropos of nothing, apparently,
while her mother attacked a second chop
that she had meant not to touch.
"Here's hoping we'll soon be back In
God's own country," said Oldaker, raising
his class.
"Hear, hear!" cried Uncle .Peter, and
drained his glass eagerly as they drank
the toast. Whereat they all laughed and
Mrs. Drelmer said. "What a dear, lively
wit, for an old gentleman."
"Oldaker," said Shepler, "has really
been the worst sufferer. '- ills is his first
trip West."
"Beg pardon, Shepler! I was West as
far as Buffaloâ let me seeâ in 1878 or
'p." Â¦ .. Â¦'. ' â¢ - Â¦
â¢"Dear me! is that so?" aueried Uncle
Peter. ."I got East as fur as Cheyenne
that same year. We nearly run into each
other, didn't we?"
, Shepler crlnned again.
"Oldaker found a man from New York
on the train the other day, up in one of
the emigrant cars. He was a truck
driver, and he looked it and talked it, but
Oldaker stuck by him all the afternoon.
"Well, he'd left the old town three
weeks after I had, and he'd been born
there the same year I wasâ in the Ninth
wardâ and be remembered as well as I
did the day Barnum's museum burned at

talk. Why. it was a treat Just to hear
him say Broadway and Twenty-third
street, or Madison square or City Hall
Park. The poor devil had consumption,
too. and probably he'll never see them
again. I don't know if I Bhall ever have
it, but I'd never leave the old town as he
was doing." â¢
"That's like Billy Brue," said Uncle
Peter. "Billy loves faro bank Jest as this
gentleman loves New York. When he
gets a roll he has to play. One time he
landed in Pocatello when there wa'n't but
one game in town. Billy found, it and
started in. A friend saw him there and
called him out. 'Billy/ says he, 'cash in
and come out: that's a brace game.*
â¢Sure?' says Billy. 'Sure,' says the feller.
â¢All right.' Bald Billy, 'much obliged fur
pn^tln' me on.' And he started out lookin*
fur another game. About two hours later
the feiler saw Billy comin' out of the
same place and Billy owned up he'd gone
back there and blowed in every cent.
'Why, you geezer,' says his friend, 'didn't
I put you on that they was dealln' brace
there?' 'Sure,' says Billy, 'sure you did.
But what could I do? It was the only
game in town!' "
"That New York mania Is the same
sort," said Shepler. laughing, while Mrs.
Drelmer requested everybody to fancy
Immediately.
"Your grandfather is so dear and
quaint." eald Mrs." Milbrey; '^ou must
certainly bring him to New York with
you, for of course a young man of your
capacity and graces will never be satisfied
out of New York."
"Young men like yourself are assuredly
needed there," remarked Mr. Milbrey
warmly.
"Surely they are." agreed Miss Milbrey,
and yet with a manner that seemed al
most to annoy both parents. They were
sparing no opportunity to make the young
man conscious of his real oneness with
those about him. and yet subtly to inti
mate that people of Just the Milbreys'
perception were required to divine it at
present. .
"These Westerners fancy you . one of
themselves. I dare say," Mrs. Milbrey had
said, and the young man purred under the
strokings. His fever for the East was
back upon him. His weeks with Uncle
Peter going over the fields where his
father had prevailed had made him con
valescent, but these New Yorkers â the
very manner and atmosphere of them â
undid the work. He envied them their
easier speech, their matter-of-fact air of
omniscience, the elaborate and cultivated
simplicity of their dress, their sureness
and sufficiency In all that they thought
and said and did. He was homesick again
for the life be had glimpsed. The West
was rude, desolate and depressing. Even
Uncle Peter, whom he had come warmly
to admire. Jarred upon him with his crud
ity and his Western assertiveness.
And there was the woman of the East,
whose presence had made the day to
seem dreamlike; and she was kind, which
was more than he would have dared to
hope, and her people, after their first cu
rious chill of indifference, seemed actually
to be courting him. She, the fleeting and
impalpable dream love, whom the thought
of seeing ever again had been wildly ab
surd, was now a human creature with a
local habitation, the most beautiful name
in the world, and two parents whose com
plaisance was obvious even through the
lover's timidity.
CHAFTER VIIL â¢ '
. UP SKIPLAP CANYON.
The tneal was ending in smoke, the
women, excepting Miss Milbrey. having
lighted cigarettes with the men. The
talk had grown less truculently sectional.
The Angstead twins told of their late
fishing trip to Lake St. John for salmon,
of projected tours to British 'Columbia for
mountain sheep, and to Manitoba- for elk
and moose.
Mr. Milbrey described with minute and
loving particularity the preparation of
oeufs de Falsan, avec beurre au cham
pagne. \
Mrs. Milbrey related an anecdote of
New York society, not much in itself, but
which permitted the disclosure that Â«he
habitually addressed by their first names
three of the foremost society leaders, and
that each of these personages adopted a
like familiarity toward her.
Mrs. Drelmer 'declared that she meant
to have Uncle Peter Bines at one of her
evenings the very first time he should
come to New York, and that, if/he didn't
let her know of his coming, she would
be offended.
Oldaker related an incident of the ball
given to the Prince of Wales, traveling
as Baron Renfrew, on the evening of Oc
tober 12. 1S60, in which his father had fig
ured briefly before the royal guest to the
abiding credit ofAmerican tact and gen
tility.
Shepler was amused until he became
sleepy, whereupon he extended the free
dom of his castle to his guests, and re
tired to his stateroom.
Uncle Peter took a final shot at Old
aker. He was observed to be laughing,
and inquiry brought this:
"I Jest couldn't help snickerln' over his
idee of God's own country. He thinks'
God's own country is a little strip of an
island with a row of well-fed folks up
and down the middle, and a lot of hungry
folks on each side. Mebbe he's right. I'll
be bound, it needs the love of God. But
if it is his own country, it don't make
him any connysoor of countries with me.
I'll tell you that."
Oldaker smiled at this assault, the well
bred, tolerant smile that loyal New
Yorkers reserve for all such barbaric be
littling of their empire. Then he politely
asked Uncle Peter to show Mrs. Drelmer
and himself through the stamp mill.
At Percival's suggestion of a walk, Miss
Milbrey was delighted.
After an Inspection of the Bines car. In
which Oldaker declared he would be will
ing to live forever, if It could be anchored
firmly in Madison square, the party sep
arated.
Out into the clear air, already cooling
under the slanting rays of the sun, the
young man and the girl went together.
Behind them lay the one street of the lit
tle mining camp, with its wooden shan
ties on either' side of the railroad track.
Down this Btreet Uncle Peter had gone,
leading his charges toward the busy ant
hill on the mountain side. Ahead the track
wound up the canyon, cunningly following
the tortuous course of the little river to
be sure of practical grades. On the far
ther side of the river a mountain road
paralleled the railway. Up this road the
two went, followed by a playful admoni
tion from Mrs. Milbrey, "Remember, Mr.
Bines. I place my child In your keeping."
Percival waxed conscientious about his
charge and insisted at once upon being
assured that Miss Milbrey would be warm
enough with the scarlet golf cape about
her shoulders; that she was used to walk
ing long distances; that her boots were
stoutly soled, and that she didn't mind
the sun \n their faces. ThÂ» gtrl laughed
at him.
Looking up the canyon with Its wooded
sides, cool and green, they could sea a
gray, dim mountain, with patches of snow
near Its top, In the far distance, and
ranges of lesser eminences stepping up
to /It. "It's a hundred miles away," ha
told her.
Down the canyon the little river flick
ered toward them, like a btllowy Â«llvÂ«r
rilbon "trimmed with whit* chiffon
around the rocks," declared the glrL

she said, as they crossed a foot bridge
over the noisy little stream and turned
up the road. "I don't believe I ever drew
a full breath until I came to these alti

what a great old fellow he Is."
"I admire Uncle Peter much more. rm' (
sure, than he admires me. He's afraid
I'm not strong enough to admire that
Eastern climate of yoursâ social and
moral."
"I suppose it's natural for you to wish
to go. You'd be bored here, would you
not? You couldn't stay In these moun
tains and be such a man as your grand
father. And yet there ought to be so
much to do here; It's all so fresh and
roomy and Jolly. Really, I've grown en
thusiastic about 1L"
"Ah. but think of what there Is .to the
Eastâ and you are there. To think that
for six months I've treasured every little
memory of youâ tuch a funny little lot as
they wereâ to think that this morning I
awoke thinking of you. yet hardly hoping
ever to see you, and to think that for
half the night we had ridden so near
each other In sleep, and there was no sign ,
or signal or good omen. And then to
think you should burst upon me like
come new sunrise that the stupid astron
omers hadn't predicted.
"You see," he went on. after a moment,
"I don't ask what you think of me. You
couldn't think anything much as yet. but
there's something about this whole af
fair, our meeting and all. that makes me
think It's going to be symmetrical In the
end. I know it won't end here. I'll tell,
you' one way Western men learn. They
learn not to be afraid to want things out
of their, reach, and they believe devoutly
âbecause they've proved It so oftenâ that
if you want a thing hard enough and
keep wanting it. nothing can keep It
away from you."
â¢ A bell bad been tinkling nearer and
nearer on the road ahead. Now a heavy
wagon, filled with sacks of ore. came Into
view, drawn by four mules. As they
Etood aside to let It pass he scanned her
face for- any sign it might show, but ha
could see no more than a look of Interest
for the brawny driver of the wagon,
shouting musically to his straining team.
"You are rather Inscrutable," he said,
as they resumed the road.
She turned and smiled lntc hi* eyes
with utter frankness.
"At least you must be sure that I Ilk*
you; that I am very friendly; that I want !
to know you better, and want you to
know me better. You don't know me at
all, you know. You Westerners have an
other way of accepting people too readily.
It may work no harm among yourselves,
but perhaps Easterners are a bit more
perilous. Sometimes, now, a very East
ern person doesn't even accept herselfâ
hlmse;:â very trustingly; sheâ heâ finds It
so hard to get acquainted with himself."
The young man provided one of those
silences of which a few discerning men
are Instinctively capable and for whlcn
women thank them.
"This road," she said,, after a llttl* time
of rapid walking, "leads right up to the
end of the world, doesn't It? See, It ends
squarely in the sun." They stopped where
the turn had opened to the west a long
vista of gray and purple hills far and
high. They stood on a ridge of broken
quartz and gneiss, thrown up In a bygone
age. To their left a few dwarf Scotch flrs
threw shadows back toward the town.
The ball of red fire In the west was halt
below the rim of the distant peak.

bushed tone that moved him a step nearer '

From up ;he canyon came the sound of
a pufliug locomotive that presently
Homestead" quartet sings "Where is My
Wandering Boy To-night?" I could see
she was annoyed and a Iltt!i worried, be
cause he was past taking notice.
The man kept' yelling the number of
their carriage from time to time, while
the others he'd called were driving upâ
it was 243 if any one ever tries to worm
it out of youâ and then I saw from her
face that 249 had wriggled pretty near to
the curb, but was still kept awav by an
other carnage. She said something to the
drunken cub and started to reach the car
riage by going out into the street behind

their carriage started forward and the
inebriate, instead of going with hir, start

she was alone on the slippery pavement
in this muddle of prancins horses and
yelling terriers.
If you can get any bets that I was more
than two seconds getting out there to her,
take them all. and give better than track
odds if necessary. Then I guess she got
rattled, for when I would have led her
back to the curb she made a clash the
other way and all but slipped under a
team of bays that were just a< htng to
claw the roses off her hat. I saw she was
helplees and "turned around. ' so I just
naturally grabbed her and she was so

.Well, this morning when 1 came up from

as if she had been waiting for me. She

of a party Rulon Shepler has with him

In manner, I suspect; a little too San
Francisco, as so many of these Western
beauties are, but you'd not mind that,
and a year in New York will tone her
down anyway.
Now if your dear uncle will only confer
a lasting benefit upon the world and his
title upon you, by paying the only debt
he is ever liable to pay, I am persuaded
you could be the man here. I know nothing
of how the fortune was left, nor of its ex
tent, except that it's sa!d to be stlrlish and
out here, t.at means a Â«is, round sum.
The reason I write promptly is that you
may not go out of the country just now.
That sweet little Mllbrey chitâ really,
Avice is far too old now for ingenue parts
âhas not only grappled the son with
hooks of steel, but from remarks the
good mother dropped concerning the fine
qualities of her son, she means to convert
the daughter's dot into Milbrey prestige,
also. AVhat a glorious double stroke it
would be, after all their years of trying.
However, with your title, even in pros
pective, Fred Milbrey is no rival for you
to fear' providing you are on the ground
as soon as he, which is why I wish you
to stav in New York.
I am iudetd gratified that you have
broken off whatever affair there may have
been between you and that music-hall
person. Really, you know, though they
talk so about us, a young man can't mess
about with that sort of thing in New
York as he can in London. So I'm glad
she's gone back, and as she is In no posi
tion to harm you I should pay no atten
tion to her threats. What under heaven
did the creature expect? Why should she
have wanted to marry you?
I shall see you probably in another fort
night.
You know that Milbrey girl must get
her effronterv direct from where they
make it. She pretended that at first she
took young Bines for wnat we all -took
him. an employe of the mine. You can
almost catch them wlnl"Ing at each other,
when she tells It. and dear mamma with
such beautiful resignation, says, "My
Avice Is so Impulsively democratic."
Dear Avice, you know, is really quite as
impulsive as the steel bridge our train
has lust rattled over. Sincerely,
look at, one of those broad, high-cheeked
faces one sees so much in the West, with
the funniest quick yellowish gray eyes,
and the most disreputable mustache I
ever saw, yellow and ragged. If he must
eat it, I wish he would eat it off even
clear across.. And he's likely to talk the
most execrable slang, or to quote Brown
ing. But he was making real love, and
you know I'm not used to that. I'm ac
customed to go my pace before sharply
calculating eyes, to show if I'm worth the
asking price. But here was real love be
ing made off down in the earth (we'd run
away from the others because I liked him
at once). I don't mind telling you he
moved me, partly because I had won
dered about him from that' night, and
partly because of all I had come to feel
about this new place and the new people,
and because he seemed such a fine, active
specimen of Western manhood. I .won't
tell you all the wild lawless thoughts that
scurried and sneaked through my mindâ
they don't matter nowâ for all at once It
came out that he was the only son of that
wealthy Bines who died awhile agoâ you
remember the name was mentioned thai
night at your house when they were dis
cussing the exodus of Western million
aires to New York; some one named the
father as one who liked coming to New
York to dissipate occasionally, but who
was still rooted in the soil where his mil
lions grew.
There was the son before me. Just an
ordinary man of millions, after allâ and
my little toy balloon of romance that I'd
been floating so gayly on a string of sen
timent was pricked to nothing in an in
stant. I felt my nostrils expand with the
excitement of the chase, and thereafter I
was my coldly professional self. If that
young man has not now a high estimate
of my charms of person and mind, then
have my ways forgot their cunning and I
be no longer the daughter of Margaret
Milbrey. nee Van Schoule. Â¦
But. Mutterchen, now comes the dis
graceful part. I'm afraid of myself, even
in spite of our affairs being so bad. Dad
has doubtless told you something must
be done very Eoon, and I seem to be the
only one to do it. And yet I am shying
at the gate. This trip has unsettled me, I
tell you, letting me. among other things,
see my old sc.f. Before I always rather
liked the idea of marriage, that Is, after
I'd been out a couple of yaarsâ not
1nn wnll V.,,f .,Â¦.., it i. __.. _ -
him no, or shall I steel myself to go In
and hurt himâ make him writhe?
And yet do you know what he gave me
while I was with him? I wonder if women
feel it commonly?, It was a desire for
motherhoodâ a curiously vivid and very
definite longingâ entirely irrespective of
him, you understand, although he inspired
it. Without loving him or being at all
moved toward him. he mad* me sheerly
want to be a mother! . Or Is it only that
men we don't love make us feel motherly?
Am I wholly Irrational and .elfish and
bad, or what am I? I know you'll lov*
me, whatever it 1., and I wish now I
could snuggle on that .oft. cushiony
shoulder of your, and go to sleep.
Can anything be more pitiful than
"a fine old family" afflicted with dry
rot like our.? I'm always amused
when I read about the suffering in
tho tenements. The real anguish i. up in
the homes like ours. We have, to do with
out so very many more things, and mere
hunger and cold are easy compared to
the suffering we feel.
Perhaps when I'm back to that struggle
for appearances, I'll relent and "barter

anything but money. We met the son
and the old man at one of their mines

there's no cnnul here. Some one said the

I am cursed not only with consistent
feminine longings and desires, but, in
spite of my training and the examples
around me, with a disinclination to be
wholly vicious. Awhile ago my marriage
meant only more luxury and less worry
about money. 1 never gave any thought
to the husband, certainly never concerned
myself with any notions of duty or obli
gation toward him. The-girls I know are
taught painstakingly how to get a hus
band, but nothing of how to be a wife.
The husband in my case was to be an in
convenience, but doubtless an amusing
one. For all his oppression, if there were
that, and even for the mere offense of his
existence, I should wreak my spite mer
rily on his vulgar dollars.
But you are saying that I like the pres
ent eligible. That's the trouble. I like
him so well I haven't the heart to marry
him. When I was 20 I could have loved
him devotedly, 1 believe. Now something
sf ems to be gone, some freshness or fond
ness. J can still loveâ I know it only too
well night and dayâ but it must be a dif
ferent kind of man. He is bo very young
and reverent and tender, and in a way so
unsophisticated. He is so afraid of me,
for 'all his pretense of boldness.
Is it because I must be taken by sheer
force? I'll not be surprised if it is. Do
we not in our secret soul of souIb nourish

her face did more things to me In a min

was full cf little kissy places. Her lipÂ«

white, and I couldn't tell about her eves
born of her long practice, in the depths
of the earth, somewhere near China, I
fancy. Her dear parents were furious.
Dressed as one of the miners they took
him to be an employe. The whole party,
taking the cue from outraged parent

from one of those subterranean galleries

It's enough to say now that though I
heard his name It recalled nothing to me,
and I took him from his dress to be a
workingman In the mine we were visiting,
though from his speech and manner of a
gentleman, some one in authority. Dear,
he was bo dear, and so Westernly breezy
and progressive and enterprising and so
appallingly candid. I've been the "one'
woman" to him, "the unknown: but re
membered ideal," since that encounter.
Of course that was to be. . said, , but
strangely enough he meant it. He was
actually and unaffectedly making love to
Â¦ me. He's not so large or tall, but quick
and springy, and muscled like a panther.
He's no' beautiful, either, but nleasant to
not enough. He has a pretty talent for it
but no genius. If I were married to him
to-morrow, as surely I am a woman I
should be made to Inflict pain upon him
the. next day, with an insane stress to
show him, perhaps, I was not the Ideal
woman he had thought me â perhaps out
of a jealousy of that very ideal I had in
spiredârational creatures, aren't we?â beg
pardonâ not me, then, but I. Now he, be
ing a real likable man of a man, can I
do thatâ for money? Do I want the money
badly enough? Would I not even rather
be penniless with 'the man who coerced
every great passion and littlest impulse,
body and soul â perhaps with a very hate
ful insolence of power over me? Do you
know, I suspect sometimes that I've been
trained down too line, as to my nerves, I
mean. I doubt if It's safe to pamper and
trim and stimulate and refine a woman In
that hothouse atmosphere â at : least if
she's a healthy woman. She's too apt
I some time to break her gait, get the bit of
tradition between her teeth and then let
her impulses run away with her.
Oh,' Mutterchen, I am bo sick and sore,
and yet filled with a strange new zest for

"Not a bit of It you won't." Abby's voice
was low and tranquil, but Roger marked
the firm undercurrent. "You are not go

are perfectly well. You must drink this

Give me the hot water bottle, Mr. Ster
lingâthere, now."
As Abby tucked down th* blankets and
patted them Mrs. Gardener settled sub
missively and sleepily Into her pillows.
After a week of Abby's care and cod
dling Mrs. Gardener was allowed to sit up
on the shady porch. She leaned back in
her big rocker with a delightful sense of
some protecting Influence about her.
"How nice it Is to think there's som*
one to depend on In a pinch," she said to
Roger, who was making a lattice for Ab
by's late flowering bean vines. "Who'd
ever thought Abby d turn out such a good
nurse and housekeeper after all her fail

her now to help me with the work."
"Oh, no; you can't, ma'am," said Roger,
pausing suddenly In his task, "because,
you see, she has secured a position."
"Hey?" gasped Mrs. Gardener, blankly.
"Abhyâ a position!"
"Yes." returned Roger, calmly, driving
in a nail. "I have engaged Abby myself."

those of the weighty Mrs. Gardener. He
looked in the door and beheld Abbyâ poor,
limp. Incapable Auby; but she was nei
ther limp nor Incapable now Her face,
which usually wore an expression of
amiable discouragement, was beaming
rosily through the hazy steam of- some
fragrant beverage she -was brewing over
the gas stove. Her slim figure, always at
a disadvantage in lawn and lace, was
shapely and trim In a tidily buttoned
cooking apron; she was supple and
springy and alert; she was brisk and alive
with purpose and energy.
She saw Roger all of a sudden gazing at
her in wonder through the steamy mist.
"Mother has a chill," she explained con
cisely. "I've got to fix 'her up and then
get 6upper for you." In spite of her filial
anxiety, .her eyes shone.
He came forward as she started away
like a rosy spirit In a cloud of vapor.
'.'Can't I help you somehow?"
"Yes, bring that hot water bottleâ and
come quick." '
"Jerusha! She didn't asK meâ she or
dered," said Roger to himself with a grin
of amusement,. as he tagged along after
the skimming goddess-like form.
"More hot stuff!" groaned Mrs. Gar
dener, as the odor of Abby's brew smote
her from afar. "I'm warmer now, Abby,
In this mountain of blankets you put over
don't know as it's worth while to hunt
another place for you. I reckon you was
cut out for a failure."
Mrs. Gardener settled back into a dis
pleased silence, rather more depressing
than her previous harangue had been.
Abby arose with a patient sigh, gathered
up her hat, gloves and parasol and trailed
limply away.
Roger Sterling looked after her with
more pity and less amusement than she
usually excited in his mind.
"If she would only let me stay quietly
at home and help her," meditated Abby,
"I wouldn't always feel so superfluous
and guilty. We don't need the money,
and I'll never get a position in a century.
Well, if I am a failure, as mother says, I
might as well make the best of It and be
as good a failure as I can. so I guess I'll
go to work and darn my stockings."
Roger Sterling, passing down the. walk
on his way to town, saw her at the win

below the great mountain on which
Michau and Le Hardy dwelt, but he had
forbidden LÂ« Hardy to be seen on his

the lover hurriedly retreated.
To his surprise the young man burst
into a fit of laughter.

sides. "After all. though, one must ad

It had happened just Wore daybreak
that very morning. Luckily for Le Hardy
himself his own cottage was not damaged,
it being on the edge at one side. His as
tonishment when he discovered the plight
of the irate parent soon gave way to glee
when he thought how neatly Michau
would be forced to forswear himself. But
Michau had no such intention.
But Le Hardy, eating his own ample
meals, could not enjoy them for thinking
of Michau's rapidly diminishing: larder.
On the noon of the second day he filled
a tray with food and carried It himself
to Michau's door.
"Voila, mon voisin," said the young fel
low good temperedly. "Thou must not
starve. I will Bhare with thee whilst
thou remainest in thy chicken coop. Thou

The hunger-clouded senses of the pris

dignified method of exitâ he was saved.
Reaching for his cane he stepped coldly
down and walked al6ng the fresh trail,
his feeble feet making Irregular prints
that stirred Le Hardy to fresh pity.
At the edge of the path he paused and
turned to the man who followed him.
"Why didst thou do this for me? Thou

surprising Bight met his view.
Le Hardy was standing close beside the
pteps, panting and resting on the handle
of a broad shovel. From the steps to the
outer edge of the field which marked the
confines of Le Hardy's propeitv, ran a
narrow trail of fresh, soft earth, richly
dark and about an inch thick.
'"Tia Lempriere," he muttered, as he
hastened to open It; but it was not Lem
priere. It was a slender, girlish figure
with drooping head, that half whispered:
"Mone pere would speak with thee."
The sweet tones were seconded by a per
emptory command from his late prisoner,
who once again stood on the fresh trail
and called to him, "Come."
Le Hardy ' came â doubting his senses.
"Tiens," said the old fellow brusquely,
"I hope I am a man," said Le Hardy
proudly. "And as a man I wage fair

I shall strive to gain her. â¢ But I will
never stoop to take a mean advantage of

"Hast thou nothing kinuiy to say to me,

The old man, now safely off the Le

"I have this to say to thee." he snapped.
"That thou are a vile scoundrel for steal

fields:"
He vanished in the distance and Le
Hardy, red and disgusted, went back to
his work.
It was sunset when Le Hardy stopped
for that day and went into the house to
get his simple supper from his bachelor
cupboard. He was setting'out the viands,
not a little sadly, when a rap on his door
startled him.

EZRA BRIGGS' REVENGE
-BY D. H- TALMAGE.
In flanking the mountains the redskins
must fall back through Trappers' Pass in
the foothills. We knew it to be a bushllne
gorge fifty feet wide and three miles long,
and at the south end It debouched upon
the plains. We made camp within half
l*r, "lifted" t'nuli and followed 'after,
and tberÂ« was no sending him back.
There wasn't a private soldier or teamster
who wouldn't have shared rations with
him, and such officers as knew of his
presence winked at the breach -of orders
and said nothing. The boy had made sig
nal flags for himself and had them with
him, but they were looked upon as play
things by most of the troopers.
We swept across the valleys of th* Big
Fork and the Big Salt, scattering th* hot
tiles whenever they made a stand, and
at length crossed the Canadian River and
forced th* red men back on the Wichita
Mountains, down on the Indian Territory
line. We had them on the run and meant
to keep them going. Just at sundown one
evening, as we were almost under the
shadow of the mountains, Wig-Wag was
cut off and captured. His mule had gone
lame and .was lagging behind. An effort
was made to rescue him, but his captors
got away with their "prisoner, and many

boy's fate. Our long and fierce pursuit

they continue their flight, or wait for us
on the plans beyond and have It out? The
general idea was that th* morrow would
witness a big fight, and daylight had
scarcely dawned after a night without
alarm, when our cams was astir. But
for the Indians being too cute we should
certainly have fallen into the trap they
had set for us. We were almost ready
for boots and saddles when a score of
warriors came riding out of the pass to
defy and taunt us. A troop was sent
against them and they retreated In haste,
but as soon as the bugle blew recall the
warriors were mocking us again. It was
a scheme to get the entire command on
the move and after them without having
taken due precautions. It was so Inter
preted by the general, and he ordered a
scout to climb up a spur of the mountain
and see what could be seen. When the
man had reached a height of fifteen hun
dred feet he signaled for a flagman to
come uo to him. Looking away to the
south he had caught sight of flags wig
wagging In the clear atmosphere of the
morning. The person waving them was
stationed on another and higher spur, and
for Rome time it was looked upon as a
mysterious proceeding. The signal man
had scarcely climbed up beside the scout
when the mystery was solved. It was
our Wig-Wag trying to open a "talk"
Bprlng came, and we set off, 600 strong,
to give the Indians a rub. No one was

Camp Supply, and but for the excitement
ef campaigning he would have been sent
â¢fit somtwhere soon. As It was, he hung
about with the teamsters for several
weeks, no one-giving him any particular
attention, and then a sutler took him on.
Wig-Wag was not enthuslastlo over
horses, guns or uniforms, but Queerly
enough he took to the signal corps. From
the first moment he saw the men talking
with each other through the medium of
the signal flag* his admiration was ex

' EAR PIERREPONT : Now, I want to give you that tip on the market. There

gPi seems safe and easy at first, but before a fellow knows it he has stepped off the
wwrn^lal edge into deep water. The wheat pit is only thirty feet across, but it reaches clear
Â¦ down to Hell. And trading on margins means trading on the ragged edge of
nothing. When a man buys, he's buying something the other fellow hasn't got. When a man sells,
he's selling something he hasn't got. And it's been my experience that the net profit on nothing is nit
When a speculator wins he doesn't stop till he loses, and when he loses he can't stop till he wins.
You have been in the packing business long enough now to know that it takes a bull only
thirty seconds to lose his hide; and if you'll believe me when I tell you that they can skin a bear just
as quick on 'Change, you won't have a Board of Trade Indian using your pelt for a rug during the
long winter months. <
Because you are the son of a pork packer you may think that yoU|know a little more than the
next fellow about paper pork. There's nothing in it The poorest men on earth are the relations of
millionaires. When I sell futures on they're against hogs that are traveling into dry salt at
the rate of one a second, and if the market goes up on me I've got the solid meat to deliver. But, if
you lose, the only part of the hog which you can deliver is the squeal. .
I wouldn't bear down so hard on'this matter Jf money Jwas the. only thing that a fellow could
lose on 'Change. But if a clerk sells pork, and the market goes down, he's mighty apt to get a lot of
ideas with holes in them arid bad habits as the small change of his' profits. And if the market goes
up, he's likely to go short his self-respect to win back his money.
I dwell a little on this matter of speculation because you've got to live next door to the
Board of Trade all your life, and it's a safe thing to know something about a neighbor's dogs before
you try to pat them. Sure Things, Straight Tips and Dead Cinches will come running out to meet
you, wagging their tails and looking l as innocent as if they hadn't just killed a lamb, but they'll bite.
The only safe road to follow in speculation leads straight away from the Board of Trade on
the dead run.
Of course the Board of Trade and every other commercial exchange have their legitimate
uses, but all you need to know just now is that speculation by a fellow who never owns more pork at
a time than he sees on his breakfast plate isn't one of them. When you become a packer you may go
on 'Change as a trader; until then you can go there only as a sucker.
I hear a good deal about men who won't take vacations, and who kill themselves by over
work, but it's usually worry or whisky. It's not what a man does during working hours, but after
them, that breaks down his health. A fellow and his business should be bosom friends in the office
and sworn enemies out of it. A clear mind is one that is swept clean of business at 6 6'clock every
night and isn't opened up for it again until after the shutters are taken down next morning.-
Some fellows leave the office at night and start out to whoop it up with the boys, and some
go home to sit up with their troubles â they're both in bad company. They're the men who are al
ways needing vacations, and never getting any good out of them. What every man does need
once a year is a change of work â that is, if he has been eurved up over a desk for fifty weeks and

mm^^^^ m^ mT h**rt good to ice the way the
ofeXsQB Christian people of this great and glor
/ra/*/m\l\ lÂ° Ui republic are protesting against tha
/ HbssIwIh outrages to them poor Jew* oarer in
I |KI3Q?i18 Russia. It ihows that *re are not yet
so dragged down by our mad rush for
sordid gold that we forget the debt we
owe to humanity. In oar eagerness to pile up dollars on
top of one another we can still pause to put up a good,
â¢tiff protest against barbarism, if It happens to.be the kind
we don't like. If there is anything we won't stand over in
this country, this land of the free and home of enlighten
ment, if s outrages against the Jews in Russia. That's one
thing that makes our blood bubble right off till our under
clothes fairly sizxle. Let the Turks boil Christiana in oil
if they have to do It for the purpose of not letting time
hang too heavy on their hands. That's legitimate, because
the Turks haven't anybody but Christians to torture, and
we as a nation don't believe in meddling with the business
of European nations anyway. We are goin' to stick to the
Monroe doctrine through thick and thin if Turkey tortures
every Christian to death that can't move out. What business
is it of ours how many Macedonians or Armenians are
roasted at the stake or tied up to gate-posts where they can
watch while their .wives and children are bein'^ tortured?
The Macedonian vote over here ain't worth lookin* out for
and the Armenians have no political influence that anybody
cares two cents about "V = â¢
- Then, again, what business is it of ours how many Hot
tentots the English kill off tryin* to get more land in Africa?
I hope nobody over here will be foolish enough to ever get
the colored brothers to take up the cause of the Hottentots
and threaten to vote against the party that didn't express
sympathy for them. If they ever do that England may as
well prepare to get licked by us once more just to make
it about three times and out
Another thing that we can overlook without botherin* our
conscience is what the French are doin' in Africa. Who
cares how many of them greasy people down there get killed
off if they don't know any better than to hold out apinst
a great and enlightened nation that wants their territory?
And they are nothin' but a lot of bow-legged Mohamme
cani, not believin' in our religion, any way, so why should
we care how many of them get wiped out? The Moham
medan vote over here wouldn't be enough to elecj a justice
of the peace in a country district if it- was all bunched to
gether. They can't expect us to run the risk of stirrin* up
foreign complications by advisin' France to go easy. France
might point the finger of sympathy at a few hundred thou
sand Mohammedans that needn't be named here and want
to know why a Mohammedan in Africa ought to have any
more tender treatment than a Mohammedan in the Philipâ
I mean than a Mohammedan anywhere else.
Once in a while part of the Russian army goes over into
China and burns a town or two and shoots and drowns
the people, but them are some more of the little acts we
haven't any right to meddle with, as long as they don't in
terfere with the open door policy. Of course, if they fol
lowed up the killin* by interferin' with our business interests
it would be perfectly right and just that we should protest
Why should a great Christian nation be expected to set
excited over the killin' off of a few hundred, or, may be,
thousand, idolaters, specially as long as there was millions
and millions of 'em left to idolotate?- If they'd adopt our
religion they might have some reason to think they had
our sympathy, but there's where they'd miss their guess.
Bigotry is not among our faults. We never let religion in
terfere in matters of this kind. We are a broad and liberal
minded people, ever puttin' humanity before creed and
freely acknowledgin' the right of the Russians, who have
always been friendly to us, to kill as' many Chinese as they
please in pursuit of healthful recreation and exercise as
long as the Chinese vote over here ain't worth goin' after.
I am pleased to say that the people of this beautiful and
enlightened village have put the stamp of their earnest dis
approval on the Russian horror agin the Jews. We held a
mass meetin' in the town hall last Thursday evenin' at which
I had the honor to be one of the vice-presidents of the
occasion. Judge Miller presided, and the meetin' was
opened with an earnest prayer by the Baptist preacher, who
said it was a time when all questions of race, creed and color
should be forgot. Then the judge took the floor to deliver
one of the eloquent speeches that make him justly famous
all through this county and some of the â¢adjoinin* town
ships.
Shivers of horror run through all of uÂ» as he told about
ihe awful things that had been done by the Russians and
there was hardly a dry eye in the hall.
"How can we as civilized people look. on this terrible
scene unmoved?" said the judge, in one of his beautiful
bursts of eloquence. "It is enough to make the star of civ
ilization quiver in its orbit and tumble in a million atoms
from its socket The picture is worthy of the darkest ago
that ever dawned. Here at the beginning of the gloriouscst
century within the memory of man is a great nation goin*
back to savagery and in a frenzy of blood-thirsty self-abner
gation forgottin' all the laws of progress. In a moment
it goes from the age of reason to the age of â "
At that point the judge was interrupted by Orrin Hitch
cock, who rushed into the hall yellin' that Ira Hooper and
a nigger by the name of Hicks Rowan had got in a fight
over a game of cards and the nigger had shot Ira in the
back end of Turner's livery stable.
â¢ After a hot chase of about two hours we caught the brute
and me and the judge had the honor of helpin' to pull on
the other end of the rope, the preacher not bein* there

Â¦ BOTTT all the use citizens of a free re
ifcAK^uaSj public have for kings to-day is to gaze
jSpfSv^rTjCJ at them from a distance when they are
OM| crowned or assassinated. The cable ac
fr^^^vK^ counts of such ceremonies and such trag-
Wfif'rS edies make interesting reading for a day
JSÂ£*Â£\Sv^h| or two, and then we go on our way, con-
| gratulating ourselves that a different
; kind of regime prevails in this coun
try. And yet for a good many hundred years the business
of making and of unmaking kings and of fulfilling royal
functions furnished the chief occupation for millions of
human beings, and constituted the chief interest of their
lives. With the growth and diffusion of democratic ideas
all over the world, the king business seems to be an out
worn industry. It appears most incongruous when the gen
tleman who happens to bear, the title of king ranks on the
moral scale only a notch or two at best, above a New York
Bowery tough, even though a thin veneer of court manners
may cover up his rottenness.
j Thank God, say I, that we have reached a point in the
development of public morals when we are demanding of
the few kings left in the world that they shall be kingly.
That is the only quality which can give them peaceful
slumbers when they lie down at night. That is the only
thing which can prevent them from being tumbled uncer
emoniously down their palace stairs either by cunning pre
tenders or by rivals'with more legitimate claims, or by out
raged public opinion. We can stand a good qlieen like
Victoria. We can even get up some enthusiasm over roy
alty, its trappings and flashing jewels, the profound salaams
and all the niceties of court etiquette, provided the sovereign
himself corresponds in bearing and .character to our child
hood's ideal of kingship. But when we have reason to be
lieve that Emperor, Mikado, Sultan, Czar or King is a
weak, flabby, dissolute, cruel, hateful specimen of a man
then for us all the glamour and glory traditionally associated
with the kingly calling vanishes.
Plain John Smith, citizen and gentleman, is a good enough
title for you. and for me. Yet while the kingly title and
function has little attraction for us, we should not disdain
the chance to help preserve in the world the true ideal of
kingship. One place yet remains in America where every
man of us may set up his throne and that is in the sacred
privacy of his own home. To all intents and purposes the
true husband, the faithful father, is king over his own house
hold. He may not claim, he never should exact any homage,
but if he has a. royal, generous nature, if through mastery
of self, he has acquired a right to rule others, if his law is
the law of kindness, if he incarnates before the eyes of his
household truth and justice day by day, then he cannot
help being the virtual monarch of, that little circle
If it is a complete circle the probabilities are that the
sovereignty will be shared by the one who sits opposite
him at the table. We hear so often to-day of the women
who shine as "queens in societies" that it sometimes seems
as though that distinction were the chief ambition of our
wives and our daughters. But for every one who 'thus
ignores her kingdom right at hand and plunges into the
artificial, fevered. life of society in the hope of making con
quests there, ten women are to be found, I believe, each
one of whom is amply content to be the guiding star, the
balance wheel, the inspiration andxthe acknowledged and
revered 'queen of her husband and her children. Once a
little lad, after being trained by his mother to say a Bible
verse in a Sunday-school, appeared on the platform and
spoke up boldly: "My mother is the light of the world."
Everybody laughed, of course, but the tactful, quick-witted
superintendent said at once, "Why, yes, my little man, of
course she is the light of your world.arranged Maltland Invited the baron and
Mabel to the same' luncheon.
Mollie came first and her brother fol
lowed. Something In the man's face or
figure seemed very familiar to Maitland
and yet he did not remember to have
seen him- before. But as the brother
raised a glass of wine the detective al
most leaped from his chair. There clasped

money taken at that time. Had the

Yet here, he was spending It openly and
In a mariner to attract the greatest pos
sible attention to himself. Then there
was the imprint of the hand on the dust
under the carpet. That was left by the
real thief.' Who was he and how did he
learn of the secret hiding place? Could
It be Molljeâ yes, why not? j The belief
that the hand under the ' bandages was
the guilty hand had blinded him. She
was an accomplice of the real thief and
was helping him to get the money that he
had somehow lost to the tramp. It was
throurh her that he must work to catch
the real criminal. _ . ,/
With Tthls end In view." Maitland visited
dally with the baron and'encouraged the
letter's attentions to Mabel. This was
not a. difficult task: . Mabel was such a
sweet little body that the baron was soon
head Cover heels In love with' her. He
showered: her with presents, dressed her
in Bilks and laces, took her to drive dally
and gave out everywhere that they were
to be married. Mollie: was /furious, but
her hold on the baron was gone. He re
fused her entrance to -his. quarters, eent
back her letters unopened and passed her
on the street with scarcely a nod of re
cognition. Maltland kept Mollie informed
as to their love affair. He wished to make
the baron so hated by his former sweet
heart that she would try to ruin him. At.
the same time he was gaining her confi
dence. After several weeks of this ma
neuvering he made an engagement with
Mollie ' to meet him at dinner. She was
also to. bring her brother, who had but
recently turned up and who Maitland was
very anxious to see. When this was all
anyway?"
"Could you put It up again so that he
wouldn't suspect?"
"Right and tight as a package of tea."
said the detective, draining his glass.
The baron poured out some brandy and
drained it at a gulp.* "To it then before
Mollie gets back. Â¦ I half suspect she
stands in with the doctor to keep me
housed up here for fear I will see the lit
tle girl." :
Maitland needed no- second Invitation.
With his penknife he quickly cut the
stitches, and rapidly unrolled the ban
dages. -His hand, shook and his face
flushed as fold after fold was wound
away. The other , watched him coolly
without once. wincing. At last the splints,
lay bare. Maltland lifted them gently
away, his gaze riveted on the fingers.
i "What's the matter with you, i-\nian?
It's the arm that Is broken, up hereihThe
fingers are all right."
"The fingers are all right." repeated the
detective, setting his teeth to hide his
disappointment, "It isn't the same at all."
"What Isn't the same? They ..haven't
changed hands on me, have. they?"
. "I could almost believe they had," Mait
land rejoined under his breath.- '.'But, say,
you needn't be cooped up here any long
er. That old doctor is a fraud. Your arm
is in fine shape. I'll put on the bandages
and we'll go out together for'an airing.
What do you say to a drive out to the hill
to see Mabel?" ' .
"I'm with you," cried the other. "Hurry
up and we'll get off at. once."
That night Maltland paced his room for
hours, trying to find the end of the thread
that j would unravel this mystery. Tho
deeper he had* gone into it the more he
was puzzled. The hand of the baron was
not the hand of the robber. Of that he 1
was certain,. And yet the money be was
"I wish I . might . have a look at your
bruised'member," said Maitland, careless
ly. . "I studied surgery once and might
find reasons for disagreeing with this old

That this was the money taken from
the express car Maltland felt confident
and yet he had no proof. If the man on
the couch was the real bandit, how came
the imprint of that hand in the dust?
Had he robbed himself to create a sen
cation, or was he after all, innocent?
That hand under the bandages!. He must
see that at any cost, and without delay."
Mollie went out and left them nipping
wine together- Maitland looked across
the table at the arm lying "stiff in its
splints and bandages. Then he got up
and went to the window, standing with
his back to his companion. When he re
turned there was a look of stern determ
ination on his face. '"Let us drink' to
the health of the little flower girl," he
cried. "What a little beauty she Is." --:..
"A strange creature, surely," replied
the other with interest. "I had hoped to
see her and thank her for the flowers she
sends. But Mollie has frightened her so
that she dare not come. When this cursed
arm is out of the splints I shall be free
and then â "
"And then you will find your little ad
mirer ready to receive you. Gad. baron,
you are a lucky fellow* And patient, too.,
If I were in your place I should be
tempted to defy that old doctor and get
out at once. Your arm must be well knit
by this time."
"That's how it seems to me, but he is
an obdurate old ass." .< ,
found more." Then he sent for a clerk
of a bank, had his man remove some
bricks from the chimney and take out
$20,000 in gold twenty-dollar pieces which
he had deposited to his credit. _
Mait'.and had b*>#n succesful In â¢work
ing up some hard cases, and he was jjiven
this cne with permission to work it out
as he pl^as/d. That suited him exactly.
He had peculiar theories and found it im
pofs:b> to work *ith any cne else suc
cessfully.
F^r two months MaStland waJked the
streets of the coast dri^t, studying the
han^s of t!iÂ» people h<Â» met. He was de
termined to find the robbers through the
lines cf that t'.oody hand. He had built
up from them the form and characteris
tics of the man who had left the impres
sion and his whole theory depended on
the solution of the problem throuph those
m^ans. H* scanned the white hands of
culture and refinement, the hands of
eports. the coarse, rouph hands of toll;
everywhere ar.d always he was locking
for that peculiar hard with Its long third
finger and stroncly marked character

One <Jay on Markrt street 1n San Fran
cisco he came upon a crowd greatly ex
cited cv#r a df<rd of heroism Just per
formed. A p*Â»ntlÂ«men had reÂ«cu#d a
young Eirl from ur.'iiT the feet of a run
awsy team at the risk of his own life.
His arm had be*Â»n broken In the-adven
ture and |m had b*en carried. away. bl*fed-_
ing and ins*>rsib>, to his lodpinp* near
by. TbÂ« girl, who was evidently from
th*> country, had insisted on going with
them to nurpe the sufferer if needed. But
what interested Maltland most was the
story to!d of the man himself. He had
upp^ared in the city several months be
fore from no one knew where, set him
self up in expensive lodgings and had
since been speeding -money lavishly, all
In 52-1 gold riÂ«-ces. He . was known as
Hugo Van Staal and ncsed as a German
baron.
Htre was a clew at last. The money
tal:e-n from the express company had all
been in <I20 g'jid piece*! The hand of the
rcbb*r was the hand of the man who
Â¦wou!^ take just such chances as this man
had taken in the rescue of the girl. Mait
lend got a boy to point out the location of
the '"taron's " loggings and then went
home to stuiy up a line of action.
A three days' investigation by Malt
land developed the startling and almost
incredible fact that Baron Van Staal was
none other thun John Bohm. a former
tramp, wha had long been a familiar fig
ure on the coast, o'-cr.sionally working for
a short tirr.e and then with his scanty
earnings poir.R off Â»ith a dog ar.d a tent
to the woods, whf-re he lived a gipsy life
until his money was gone.
This transformation could be accounted
for on no ordinary hypothesis. A hobo of
yesterday living to-day the gilded life of
a profligate nobleman. Nothing was too
pood for the baron. He fell in with the
game ts one to the manner born; that he
knew of better days before becoming an
outcast Tvas evident. With a retinue of
lackeys ever at Ms heels, fawning syco
phants to flatter, he did the swager wiLh

gold he ehowered upon his friends. Car
riages fcr drives, yachts for outings,
everything responded to his beck. What
jolly days ar.d nights there were for the
ladles of the ballet. And the suppers
with carte blanche to the chefsâ there
were none like them in town. 'Wine,
women, mirth ar.d laugi.ter," and the
barcn paid the freight with a conde-

to successfully plan and carry out daring
train robberies? Did he ha\-e a third
pbue of existence, that of the fearless
hirhwayman?
Maitland determined on a bold venture.
The next cay he called on Baron Van
Ktaal. As he was going up the stairs to
his lodgings he met a slip of a girl. There.
wrrÂ« t*ar* in her blue eyes and her lips
wer<Â» trembling with suppressed sobs.
"What's the matter, little girl? Can I
be of service to you?" he inquired gently, b;
"No, sir. I have b^cn bringing flowers
every day for the gentleman who saved
my life. They told me he was pleased to
pet them. But to-day a lady Is with him
and ?he threw 'my flowers out of the win
dow and told me I must not bring any
more, for they annoyiii him."
"That Is too bad. There may be some
mistake."
"Oh. Pi! ; do you think so?"
"I will try and find out for you. What
Is your name?"
, '"Mabel Davis, sir. I live with my aunt
over on Telegraph Hill. We are too poor
to buy flowers, but I gather them for
him."
'"Wei:, don't worry. I am on my way
to call on the baron and will make in
quiries and let you know. Meet me here
to-morrow at this hour."
The girl thanked^ him an^ Maltland
went on. He rang the bell and sent in a
card with tho message that he was an
Eastern tourist who had. heard of the
baron's heroism, and called ft> pay his re
spects. A tall, dark woman received him.
She whs beautiful and was drejsed ex
travapantly, but there were lines of dis
sipation in her face, and the keen eyes of
the detective discovered cigarette stains
on her taper white flngerr.
"I beg pardon for this seeming intru
sion, baroness, but I did not wish to leave
the city without paying my respects to
your brave husband. I hope he has suf
ficiently recovered to receive me."
Flattered by the distinction of being
taken not only for a wife but a baroness
the woman ushered the visitor into the
room where a roan lay on a richly draped
couch. His rale face was kindly and pre
possessing-, although certa'n lines about
the mouth and chin betokened indolence
and wfaknefs of character. Not the face

wavÂ»d him a welcome with his free hand
and hp sat down. The rlpht arm of the
prodigal tramp was swathed in splints
and bandas-es so that the hand was- en
tirely concealed, but the left, which lay
upon the counterpane, was slender and
well formed, with the second ringer ex
tendirjr the usual lenpth beyond the oth
ers. Tf on'y the other hand wer* visible.
What mysteries dfd those handasros con

satisfy himself. If thie man was giiilty
he was fast snendinp the money of the
express company. If he was not. the de
tective was Wing valuable time. But
there was nctbins: to do but wait.' A
wrong accusation would discover his
plans to. the world and bring down ridi
cule instead of .praise. He mentioned
meeting a cirl on the stairs and saw a
new light come into the man's eyes. But
those of thiÂ» woman flashed with hatred.
"I sent her anay" she said curtly. "She

She is nothine but a street waif at the

"I told you I would like to see her when
she came aga!n. Mollie." he paid weakly.
She frowned at the name' and apologized
for him.
"A pet name the baron has given me.
He forgets there is a stranger present."
The baron turned his head on the pillow
and Maltland thought he saw the shadow
of a smf!e flit across his features. Then
he turned h's attention to the woman and
was successful In winning from her an In
vitation to call apaln the next day.
That nleht thieves entered the baron's
lodpinps and carried away some. $1800 in
gold that he had secreted under the floor.
When Maltland heard of It he hastened
to his n**w acquaintances to offer his
sympathies. He was shown the place
where the carpÂ«t had been ripped up to
pet at the hidden treasure. And there In
the dust upon a board was the Imprint

At the trial the baron, with Ingenious
complacency, confessed his part tn thÂ«
affair. He smilingly acknowledged his
identity: that Baron Van Staal and John
Bohm, the tramp, were one-and the same
person. His remarkable rise In thÂ© world
he- explained to be the sheerest accident.
It happened a few weeks earlier when
hoboing through a mountainous district
out on the Southern Pacific. He had left
the railway track intending to take a
short cut through seme timber to a ham
let near by. Tired, footsore and hungry,
he had never, before been so down on his
luck. A few mouthfuls of food he must
beg and If possible find a shed to protect
him from the cold. Night was coming on,
but he struck out Into the woods unmlid
ful. On and on he wandered into the
gloom until black night enveloped him.
Lost; beVildered. almost fainting with fa
tigue, he tumbled over a hollow log and
lay there In a state of coma until awak
ened the next morning by the warbling
of the birds in the trees. Opening his
eyes and In a dazed sart of way realizing
he was chilled, lie noticed the hollow log.
Viewing it as a possible shelter he reach
ed in his hand to discover its feasibility.
His hand struck something. It was round
and hard and cold. Withdrawing the ob
ject he found It to be a $20 gold piece.
Half crazed with delight he made another
dive and dragged out handfuls. ,
The rest of his story Is easy. There
was J60.C00 in the log. It Jaad been hidden
there by the real robbers at the time of
the crime, but before they returned the

daring thieves and highwaymen In ths

Mabel Davis declared her belief tn th*
man who had saved her life, gave up all
the Jewels and finery that Van Staal had
presented to her and pleaded so hard with
the Judge for his acquittal that he was
discharged on the promise that he would
give up his roving and settle down to earn
an honest living. He and Mabel were
married and are now living happily on a
little farm in California.

"Not Just yet." said Maltland, stepping
between the two men and covering both

under the force of it. but drawing a re

caught his hand and wrested the weapon
from him. But he was now mad with

he cried: "Tramp! thief! devil! It Is my

At last they came: the baron, tall and
courtly, his companion fresh and pretty

had laid aside her new finery and wore a
simple dress, no ornaments save a bunch
of violets at her throat. At the entrance
Mollle'9 eyes Cashed fire and the man be

could be said Maltland sprang up, and
prasplng the baron's hand, cried: "My

Ornament is one consideration, but there
is another thing that recommends the
brilliant creature in a more practical way.
Some one discovered not long ago that
there Is no watch dog equal to the pea

| "What I want the girls tÂ» realise above
all la that they can have prettily ap
pointed homes for, very Uttle money,"
says Mrs. Cornwall. "It's all nonsense to
be discouraged just because you can't
call In the swellest upholsterer In town
and give him carte blanche. I know," be
cause I furnished a simple little country

â¢with some dainty sprays of marguerites,
and you'll aee a bed that would lull any
body to sweet slumber." .? "
"What will you do with it after it's
flnlshed>'
"Well, in such cases the girls usually
draw lots for a thing that they've all
worked on; but In this case I want to
keep it at the club." You' see there are
times when a girl Is detained down town
by a pressure of work and she lives so
far away that it's hard to set home; so
it would be a boon to her to have a,plac6
where she could sleep near tier work. As
it is, the girls often drop in here and set
themselves a meal in any. emergency. The
gas-stove is always ready, you see."
"-.'â¢! Euro â¢:. enough. In ; the other room 1* a
trim little gai-stove flanked by everything
needful to a meal In the way of pots,
pans and kettles. Across the room Is a
shelf laden with shining china and glass.
A long array of pretty blue and white
cups shows that the club's afternoons at
home are well attended.
While the quarters are still small one
corner of the kitchen has to play library
and there Is a good array of books and
magazines. This, with a soft couch and
a good drop lightâ can you think of any
thing more cozy and restful for an over
worked girl?
"We want more room and we'll have It
some day," Mrs. Cornwall says. "Several
dressmakers have offered to teach the
girls to make their own â¢ garmentsâ but
we are too crowded here to lay them out
and cut them. Even the attempt at shirt
waist making was difficult. Just now the
girls are economizing like thrifty house
wives, for they are paying for the piano."-
They are buying it themselves, these
enterprising young workers, and It is the
life of the club. Mrs. Ross has worked
faithfully giving the girls vocal lessons
and some of the talent developed Is worth
while listening to.
. On cooking night the place Is full of
savory odors that would make any epi
cure's mouth water. You see these girls
are preparing themselves to be good
homemakers In every sense of the word,
whether married or single.
They carry home to mothers and
fathexi and brothers and slaters all sorts
On Wednesday night comes the sewing
elasn. which Mrs. Cornwall conducts. But
what she teaches them Is only a part of
what they learn. They give each "other
â¢n sorts of points. One girl Is a profes
sional milliner and she showed the whole
club how to make and trim its own hats.
Every Easter hat that those girls wore
was made by the wearer at not more
than a dollar's cost and some of the crea
tions were enough to keep every neigh
bor's eye off bis or her prayer book.

The Porteous girls work all day and
when night comes they seek the little
clubrooms for relaxation. There Is both
pleasure and profit In what they find
there.
For the girls come from here, there
and everywhere, from Point Lobos ave
nue to the heart of town, from North
Beach to the Mission. They come from
all sorts of professions, too: one Is a
hairdresser, another a milliner, another
answers to your "Hello" every ttme you
call up a certain private exchange.
That is the one requirement if you want
to enter this clubâ you must be a wage
earning girl. The age limit Is drawn at
25, eo evidently the Porteous Club does
cot consider that girlhood may pass be
yond that crucial point.
The graceful, dignified girl who ex
plained that she was a hairdresser
brought her sister along the other night
as a visitor.
"She wants to join the club," said a
member, "but she can't. She doesn't
work,** and there was a deal of pride
went with it.
But the location was not altogether
convenient. Many of the members found
It remote and one of them savs with a
reminiscent shiver. "It was such a
spooky walk to the car I used to be afraid
when I had to go alone, and I met some
body one night that I'm sure was a foot
padâhe had that expression." So for the
better convenience of everybody the club
moved to Larkin street and has remained
there ever since, within easy reach of sev
eral car lines.
The club is named for Mrs. Janet S.
Porteous, who has played Lady Bountiful
from 1U birth In 1898. The club was
formed then by the California Club and
the motto adopted was, "Not what we
have, but what we share." Mrs. Porteous
lived up to the motto as much as the girl
members are expected to do. and since
she found herself blessed with many of
this world's goods she did a great deal of
â¢baring. For the first two years she fur
nished cory rooms for tne girls over in
South Park, and wtth these as headquar
ters the work got under promising head
way.
Now. Mrs. Arthur Cornwall is the good
fairy of the little club and she has been
Â«ver Bince its beginning. Never a Wednes
day evening but finds her In the club
rooms in the Supreme Court building: so
she ought to know all there is to know
about the aims and hopes and methods of
the work.
"Try mÂ«itally to look into the faces of
the members of the Porteous Clubâ young
girts' faces; full of life. Instinct with the
capacity for enjoying life.
"And then remember that these girls
spend the long day in the grir.d of office,
shop, factory, faithful monotonous ser
vice of one kind or another. Sick or well,
fair weather or foul, they must be at the
dally routine, many of them earning a
bare pittance In return for their labor.
"In many a case the pittance has to be
?arned not alone for self-support, but to
aid the aged relative or the young brother
and sister who cannot help themselves.
"And thry plod on and on. but mere
plodding does not absorb their faculties.
The desire for self-culture is upon them.
In their young hearts ptlrs the American
Instinct to forge ahead, the America n
faith that there is a higher place in the
working and social scale for every one
who earnestly peeks to rise. Strong in
this faith they allow themselves no waste
time, but spend their few leisure hours
In the effort to fit themselves for that
higher place."
â¢*^f CLUB that helpsâ whom and how?
f I There are so many club* that help.
f~f There we those that help the
VÂ» I climbers to climb, for instance.
Â¦A The Porteous is none of these.
Others help the poor to remain poor.
There is no charity about the Porteous.
Tou can't really appreciate its ways and
means unless you visit it. Then you can
bear it speak for Itself. You will realize
that It helps a lot of brave, cheery. *el'
supportlng girls to be braver and cheer
ier. Mrs. Cornwall has written:
Think of all these privileges to be- had
for the fee of twenty-five cents a month.
What other club offers so much for so lit
tle? "What it lacks In worldly wealth It
makes up in other ways. Girls give a
helping hand to one another. The spirit
of friendliness prevails. One girl who**
mother has died and who is left alone and
sad says: "I thought there wasn't any
thing to live for at first. But now I've
joined the club and I can hardly wait for
the meeting times to come."
The club is entirely Independent now,
looking bravely after Its own Interests.
But it has many friends of greater pros
perity than It3 own and these have helped
cheer the little rooms with pretty and
useful gifts. Rugs, chairs, tables, cur
tains, lamps, china, books, palms, glasses,
a. clock, a sewing machine, teaâ all these
and more appear on the long list of gifts.
The world has been good to the Porteous
Club, for the world Is always Inclined
to copy after Providence and hel> taoee
that help themselves.
The club fa governed by officers ehosea
from and elected by the club members.
Miss Louise Bemmerer U the president
and she swings the gavel with a parlia
mentary precision that would put tÂ»
shame the officers of some larger club*.
Vice president, secretary and treasure*
are all drawn from the ranks of the girl
members and each looks after her du
ties with the greatest punctiliousness. A
business meeting takes place ones a
month and then the girls pat on their
most seriously businesslike faces. But
during the sewing and the cooking and
the hat trimming the faces are anything
but serious and the tongues go as fast as
the fingers.
Although self -improvement be the aim.
It Is not to be supposed that the girls do
nothing but learn to take themselves se
riously. They have their social pleas
ures as well. Mrs. Porteous recently In
vited as many of them as possible tÂ»
spend a happy day with h*f"at her coun

another pleasure which a friend has giv
er, them. Then they play hostess thenv>
selves and entertain like society women

days they always Keep open N house for
their friends. Twelve members of the
California Club look back to the pleasant
memory of a dinner given them by the
girls, who cooked and ..erved every dish
themselves. Every now and then a dance
comes off. and then the piano and the
feet fly. The corridors of the building

haps some lucky man will profit by the**
same Ideas later on.
Strawberry night cornea once a year,
and then the fragrance of preserving
ascends from the little' gas stove and
floats out faintly through the corridors of
the building: whenever the door is opened. t
One happy night In June the girls all roll
up their sleeves, don their aprons and
put up strawberry preserves better than
anybody ever tasted. They have a deli
cious recipe of their ownâ so delicious,
â¢las, that onlv one member who took
home a Jar of* It was able to reoort on

The girls take a tremendous pride In

matter how late, without every dish be

rags and scraps brushed up. all the furni
ture in place. Their curtains must be
spotless and their furniture dustless to
come up .to their standard.

In the afternoon you see such a variety
of pretty footgear, and one of the pret

Skirts are worn shorter than they were.
The walking skirt Is in every woman s

And old ribbons can be used ta so many
ways this year. The ribbon drawer can
be completely cleaned out In the search
for odds and ends and the whole caa be
turned Into such very pretty trimmings.
Ribbons are aewed together with hem
stitching and with fagottlng. They are
shirred and used as rufSes, no matter how
wide the ruffle may be or how narrow.
Ribbon Is ssttde Into ruchlng and is used
for the tops of flounces and for applique
work, and there Is another kind of ribbon
niching which can be turned to account in
the making of a ribbon boa for the neck.
But the way the French dressmakers
like best to use ribbon Is to shir It on
each edge and to use it as a pufong upon
waist or skirt. It can be placed In such
a way as to form a very pretty pattern.

design.
It Is In this way that the economical
French woman utilizes the old materials
with which her patrons provide her and

best effects.

of baby ribbon and sewed It to the edge Â»f

"Then I took the ribbon and used It
upon the skirt, putting it en ta points,
row after row. until the whole bottom of

A I been In such clover as at the pres
( ent time. While the coverings of
V V libraries have always been neat,
strong and durable, they have re
s&alned rather plain and sedate Instead of
running to the fanciful and grotesque.
It has been but comparatively few years
since a gay binding and illustrations sig
nified a book exclusively for the amuse
ment of little folks, but now you have to
read the title and In addition scan a few
pages before being absolutely certain Just
who the book was written for. anyway.
When publishers on this coast, and we
have a few of themâ although they are
precious fewâ needed a fine book bound it
was no end of trouble to place an order
with the famous Guild of Women Binders
of London, not only on account of the
time consumed by the distance, but in the
actual expense, for while the members of
this guild know every trick In their busi
ness they know also how to charge as

Just fancy. If you can, paying anywheie
from VS> to S30 for a single book! Yet this
Is what people are doing every day, and
apparently thinking little or nothing about
It. For instance, "Mother Goose," "Little
Bed Biding Hood" and a score of nur
sery rhymes are English productions. The
leather that binds them is white nad very
flexible to begin with. The designer Is
permitted to use her own Judgment as re
gards the cover, only it must be submit
ted for approval before being finally chos
en.' After that she turns her attention
and skill to the color scheme. Two, three
and frequently four tones are selected,
according to the text of the book, and
the way they are used demonstrates her
ability.
In the rhymes the rays of the eun are,
of course, gold, and Mr. Sun is a mass of
bright gold beaming and smiling upon the
youngsters as they have little chats with
the people of his world. The winding
path, the trees and the children are bits
of green and brown, with now and then a
touch of red. And because the outside
has received bo much attention does not
mean that the other side of the cover has
been neglected by any manner of means.
"While it is not as fanciful, it is lined
with a soft brown silk that is stretched
over the paper and does not quite reach
the outer rim, yet when the book is
opened in the least the rich brown makes
Itself known.
Perhaps no better or no more attractive
books have ever been issued from the
press than this series, for it certainly ful
fills the ideal of every child that chances
to see them, and pleases the fond mam

consider that its market value is the
good, round sum of $50 it seems like a wee
bit of extravagance to epend so much for
a mete bauble when a tenth of the price

And there is another thing to be consid

Advertising for Models.
One man, after hunting for two months
to eecure the right sort of beauty for an
advertisement for a champagne house,
hung out on his showcase a glaring sign,
which read:
"Beautiful women will be paid liberally
for posing for photographs."
The result was, according to the pho
tographer, that every woman who pasted
by and read the sign then bolted upstairs
into the etudio. For two weeks his place
wsi overrun with women who believed
that they were dreams of loveliness, and
wrre Indignant and called the photog
rapher a "mean, horrid brute" when he
politely intimated that their style of
beauty was not suited to the work in
hand.
It was on the morning of the day that
the photographer, in- despair, had decided
to give up ihe quest for the golden girl
that a petite, eparkllng-eyed. chestnut
haired, rosy-cheeked and vivacious girl
of about seventeen summers'' tripped
gracefully up to the photographer and
litped in a. frightened sort of way:
"Maybe I'd do?"
"For full five minutes." said the pho
tographer, "I stared at that child. It was
rude, but I couldn't help it. After two
weeks of gazing at streams of distorted
ugliness I couldn't keep my eyes from
feasting on that dainty bit of beauty.

The girl at first was inclined to be in

a policeman, when the man's all too evi
dent embarrassment convinced her of his
good intentions, and she burst out laugh-
Ing.
Her display of merriment over, she said
she'd "ask mamma," and the result was
that a few days later she appeared In the
photographer's studio.
Her first poses made her career. Other
Â¦ photographers and artists beheld the pic
tures, waxed enthusiastic, hunted up the
original, and swamped her with orders.
And on the top of it all a well known
theatrical manager sent for her and of
fered her a remunerative place In the
beauty line of his star company.
Stores the Best Source for Models.
This is not an exceptional case.
"Of the thirty or forty models that I
am now working with," said a photog
rapher, "nearly every one has been found
in this manner. Let's see. I can recall
that I secured seven. of them by ap
proaching them in the street, at the Im
minent risk of being taken as an insulter.
In the stores I got twice that number, but
there the task is not so delicate. Â° A wo
man behind a counter does not have the
fear of the masher that the woman walk
ing along the street possesses. Several
of the rest I engaged at the theaters,
where mv wife and I go four times a

"Fact is, 'the big stores are the best
places to secure beautiful girls, and the
majority of the most used models are
graduates from the men's furnishing and
perfume counters. They far outnumber
the actress models, popular opinion to the
contrary notwithstanding.
"The young, vivacious and pretty act
ress makes a good model when she is
scarcely more than a beginner behind the
footlights. But after two or three years
she loses her natural bloom, owing 'to Â¦
hard work and the irregular life, and then
she can no longer be suitable for an all

Little Real Authority

Tho position of commanding general of
the army has always been an anomalous
one, the incumbent havlnr a high sound-
ing title and wearing a gorgeous uniform,
but possessing little real authority. He
has had no control whatever over the
funds and it has been almost impossible
for him to escape friction with the Sec-
retary of War.
When George Washington was appoint-
ed to the place he came almost imnwdl- ro
ately into conflict with the War Secre-
tary, Mr. McHenry. - Every' commanding
general since then has had the same sort
of trouble, and General Sherman found
his situation so exasperating that he
moved the headquarters of tho army to
St. Louis. As for General Miles, he has
hardly been on speaking terms with
either Alger or Boot and has been prao
tlcally Ignored. , \- -' >

The staff will tee that the bureau of the
quartermaster general Is at all times In
a thorough state of preparedness, . and
likewise the commissary bureau and other
branches of the War Department. No
such thing as being taken by surprise will
be possible.'
It Is probable that this governing body
will take Incidentally the place of the
General Fortifications Board and will su

our seacoast defenses. In this way It will

These are only a few suggestions of
what the general staff will do. but they

promptly to the points where they are
most needed. ,

enough for ambition to ask.
Even down to recent times they have
remained of high rank. The modern Von

something deeper than a whim? Was it
a life tragedy? Surely no ono would think

contentedly In his hammock, puffing con

some out-of-date raper that has reached
his isolation.
He had been finely educated, aa tho
German youths are. He was already well

Germany was scoured for him. No
trace was found. Ho had mysteriously
dropped out' of sight. The disappearance
was common talk at the time, but the

strength, come to the four score mark,
and still he has never told.
Was it av^tory of a beautiful and cruel
German maiden? We have always been
warned, "Cherchez la femme." Did she
refuse to listen to the wooing of the
handsome young nobleman? Did he take
a bitter heart away with him to the far
corners of the earth? Or was it, as Wil
liam Anderson says, the boyish lovo of
wandering that was upon him and drove
him away from the vaterland, where his
rosy path was laid out lor him by the
hands of his forefathers? Did he have -a
brave young longing to seek new worlds
andÂ» their difficulties for himself? Did
he rebel at the slavery to tradition ' that
"position" Imposed upon him and long
to be as free as a wandering gypsy?
However, whyever It was. he cut loose
from all that was his by right of heritage
and ability and betook . himself as a
stranger in a strange land to places that
the old and distinguished family of Von
der Goltz might have had to search the
msp for. - Â¦ ~-i * Â¦

From Polonia they went to Germany and
kept their distinction. The Emperors

Only the old people remember the story
of the vanished boy. .
While the search waa going on he was
making his way to America. That was
the new world that promised all sorts of
dreams fulfilled to the boyish heart. New
York and the East were not new enough
for him. After some two or three years
of restlessness be made his way to Cali

He was full cf good spirits and the love
of adventure and the daring to woo It,
but he found no fortune In the mines.
Perhaps he did not much want It He
liked' to seek new lands, to see for him
self, to take risks, but the greed for gain
seems never to have been strong In him.
So he made his venture and staked his
claim, but the earth yielded up very little
to htm and ho never made much more
than a living. . '
Before he left America ho marriod an
English girl. She knew that she had a

After a period of wasted effort at min

The charm of a girl In her first season
lies In the novelty of situations. If she
Is wholesome mentally and physically
she enjoys everything; that comes her
way. The. games, the sports, the out-of
door exercise all add to the charm, and
she sees life through the clow pf her awn
buoyant spirits.
On a yacht the wind may blow until
her gown flaps a merry measure with
the sails, and her hat may take wines,
but she laughs a half embarrassed laugh
at her own discomfiture.
Life beyond the school room Is busy
unfolding new sensations and creations
and she lives and loves It all.
It Is then that a girl should be taught
to control her feelings yet without too
much repression, and parental Influence
should mold a girl's character.
So many young people encourage the
Idea that they must show their likes and
dislikes, despite all other considerations.
Mothers of debutantes are often fearfully
mortified by a girl's bluntness. who does
not care what she says, and has not had
the experience that teaches that polite
ness rules the outside world rather than
the honesty recognized by the school girl's
code.
Tho too free expression of opinion Is onÂ«
of the most fatal mistakes of tho newly

dulge her likes and dislikes too plainly
and thus finds herself at times unpleas

to treat every one with the same courtesy

ONCE upon * time there was a Bear who was forever poking his nose into obscure placea, apparently in search of something. Just what he was after no one eoold tell till one day he
poked his nose into the moutn of an Alligator, whereupon the Alligator immediately closed his jaws upon the Bear's head, and would not release him until he made the following confes
sion: "Ohl most noble and kind sir, it is very distressing to lay bare the secret of my life in this painful manner, but as there seems to be no help for it, I will proceed at once. As you will
perceive by my color. I am what is known as a Cinnamon Bear, and, whether justly or otherwise, you will be able to judge better later on. Now, it so happened when I was a cub that
one day my parents left me alone while they went in search of food, and as they never returned I now take it for granted that instead of obtaining what they sought they became food for
somebody else. Many, many weary days I spent in vain search for them. I became thin and careworn, and out of sympathy for me I was one day seized by my friends and made prisoner, lest
I should lose my life in the fruitless search for my father and mother. By some oversight I was soon forgotten by my friends and left to die in solitary confinement Hunger began to. gnaw at my
vitals, and in a little while I fell exhausted. I became delirious, and imagined that I was beset by a great multitude of wild beasts from a strange land of a kind which I had never seen before
and on seeing my helpless condition they were about to devour me. Then there came a Grasshopper, who offered to provide me with a light lunch, that I might strengthen myself. On accepting
his apparently kind offer I was soon provided with a bountiful repast, which I learned afterward was composed of glowworms. Being thus strengthened. I was about to escape from my torment
ors when lol I discovered that I had changed into a snow-white bear. The light of the glowworms which. I had eaten- shone through and made my body as light as day. From that time forth
life was a' burden to me. for everywhere I went I was taken for a ghost, and so driven from place to place. I found no rest till at last I reached the solitude of the frozen North, and there in
the midst of ice and snow, I passed my days. I found shelter and plenty of food in an old wreck which had been abandoned by some exploring party. One day, to my surprise, I discovered
that I was gradually assuming a different color. I immediately investigated the matter, and found by examining the labels of the boxes that I had been living on cinnamon cake. In a little while I
made iuch a presentable appearance that I was able to return to mv home and friends, and here I am." "Yes." remarked the Alligator, "but why do you go about continually poking your nose
Into obscure corners and places?" "Ohl" replied the Cinnamon Bear, "that's easy; I'm looking for the Grasshopper who filled me up with glowworms, so that I can eat him."-' .â¢ -
The moral of this fable is: "We are angry with those who trick us. because they seem to have more wit than ourselves." ' \V. M. GOODES

"A few weeks ago D. W. Mulvane went
to Washington to press the claims of
Charles Bloodsmith as a candidate to suc

that as Senator Long and Mr. Leland and
Governor Bailey had been recognized la
the appointment of Judge Hook to a Cir
cuit Judgeshlp, it was only fair that Sen
ator Burton and Mulvane and that wing
of the party should be recognized in the
appointment of Hook's successor.
"Last spring Senator Burton called at
the White House and told the PisÂ»ident
that he (Burton) was interested in a high
class Christian exhibit at St. Louis, to be
an exact reproduction of the City of Jeru

"The President was enthusiastic and
gave Mr. Burton a letter to some friends,
speaking very highly of the scheme as a
moral agent. Burton took the letter,
which was a personal and private one. put
it in the center of a big advertisement of
stock of the Jerusalem scheme and sent
'Â¦i to a ma?a?.ine, making the President,
by the jrtcdlns of the advertisement, ad

to learn if the letter was genuine.

C, July 11.â The political atmos
phere of Japan during the. last
week has , been | t riickv wltb/"ru
mors of i impending war. The
signal for their birth was the
arrival of General Kouropatkin, Russian
Minister of War, who is expected to leave
on the warship Askold-for home to-day,
thereby considerably curtailing the an
nounced term of his stay.
The immediate cause of the angry senti
ment is a succession of reports of Chi
nese diplomatic intrigues with Russia at
Peking and of the Russian encroachment
upon Korea. On the 17th it was reported
in Peking that Prince Cbing, while, pro
fessing to, be ill, was negotiating with
the Russian -Minister through Lien Feng,
Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, who
acted as interpreter at the first confer
ence between the Prince and Minister
Lessar on the 10th.
On the 19th it was wired that Mr.
Uchida, Japanese Minister at Peking, the
day before filed a formal demand on the
Chinese authorities to open Moukden and
Tai Tung Kout -to ; foreign trade and ex
horted them not to accept even one article
of the Russian demands. As to the open
ing of the ports in question, the Chinese
authorities replied that the circumstances
were not favorable for compliance. The
British Charge d' Affaires, Mr. Townley,
was reported to have taken the. "same
stand as Japan. The United States de
manded the opening of the harbor In ad-
said that when the Japanese Minister in
.tercogated,Prince Ching on. June 22 that
the Prince flatly, denied the existence of
any secret agreement with -Russia. Later
it was announced that the agreement,
containing four parts, had been forward
ed to St. Petersburg for imperial sanction,
whereupon 'it would go into immediate
effect. Â¦ . .â¢.:Â¦- '
The belief is that the convention exists,
but that it was concluded . between the
Russian Minister and the Chinese Vice
Minister, so that Prince Chins will be
able to disclaim any' official knowledge of
its existence, in the .meantime it was
stated that Prince . ChlRÂ£* informed Mr.
Townley, British . Charge , d 1 Affaires at
Peking, that he had not seen M. Lessar,
but that Vice Minister Lien Feng had
been conferring 'with the Russian Minis
ter, and an arrangement wholly satisfac
tory to the powers concerned would be
concluded shortly. ........
Russia still maintains its grasp on the

Continuing, he said he was interested
personally in the proposed Wheeling,
Waynesburg and Eastern Railroad, which
would connect the great mills of the Wheel

Gould's assertion that he is back of it
means its success. In that case the Ohio
will be bridged here and connection made
with the Wheeling and Lake Erie, already
dominated by Gould interests. Before his
train left Gould said, smilingly:
"Times will continue good; it looks that
way to me. and I do not think the view
is too optimistic. The entire country
seems to be solidly prosperous."
"One good feature about the railroad
will be its lack of dangerous or even
heavy grades. None will be so hard as
to prevent the hauling of seventy or
seventy-five cars in a single-head train,
and this is saying a great deal," said
Gould. . " f.

Special Dispatch to The Call,
view of thf fortieth anniversary the Em
j>eror hed seen fit to elevate his wife and

The father of Emily Brown was a Pres
byterian missionary and the first Pro
testant to settle in Seoul, the capital of
Korea. His youthful daughter, who pos
sessed a beautiful voice, sang frequently
Tn the mission church. The beauty of the
maiden was reported to the. Emperor, and
the ruler commanded her to enter his
harem, which she indignantly refused to
do. Two years later she concluded to
move into the palace after the Emperor
had promised to marry her.
Emily Brown, with true American
fhrewdness. alter the tragic death of the
first wife of the Emperor of Korea and
her own elevation to imperial rar.k, made
it a condition that she should re{ain her
Christian name. Although previously only
the "first favorite" of the Emperor, she
nevertheless was always greatly honored
by the courts of Tokio and Peking.
At the beginning of this year, to the
surprise of every one, the Korean Official
Gazette announced that the favorite had
been laised to the rank of Imperial
Princess, with the full title of Empress-
Queen. The official announcement also
stated that after the death of his first

His cries became incoherent and before
the enraged citizens could be checked the
skin was literally cut from his body and
distributed among the villagers. He died
with his e7es on the little girl whose
life he had ruined. His heart was then
cut out with jack knives, his toes and
fingers chopped off and carried away as
mementoes. His bloody and mangled form
was then soaked with kerosene and fired.
He would have been torn limb from
limb on the spot, but the horrible crime
seemed to demand a more cruel death
and cool heads kept the enraged mob

the mob gave vent to its wild desire for
revenge and it was by the greatest efforts
of the leaders that it was kept back.

his little victim was then placed before
the glaring eyes of the brute, while will

WHEELING. W. Va., July 11.â A spe
cial to the Register from Bluefields says:
The little town of Devon, Mingo County,
was the scene yesterday of an attack
upon a 14-year-old girl by a negro, fol
lowed by his lynching by a mob number
ing more than 200 men. The little girl
was caught a short distance from her
home by the r.egro and carried to a
neighboring wood, where she was tied to
a tree and gagged. Her absence was no
ticed by neighbors, who immediately
formed themselves into a searching par
ty. She was found in an almost dying
condition, but was able to tell the story
to the horror-stricken searchers.
Wild were the cries for vengeance, but
rafter a consultation it was decided to qui
etly lay in wait for the fiend. In a short
time he appeared and was about to re
new his attack upon the helpless child
when the entire mob of concealed search
ers emerged and made for him.

not difficult to comprehend. It is grad

men of China that a knowledge of the
Confucian classics is no longer what it
was from a commercial point of view.
And the comprehension of this fact is
sufficient to account for the diminishing
interest that Is being taken in the ac
quisition of Confucian learning. It must
also be admitted that, as the broader and
deeper knowledge Introduced and incul

assimilated there is an ever increasing
realization of how inadequate Confucian-

Careful observers in China are noticing
the gradual decay of Confucianism. Its
sway over the minds of the Chinese liter

recently as twenty or thirty years ago.
It is true that there is apparently *\o
marked diminution in the number of an
cestral halls, the .existence of which all
over the land serves as an indication of

nevertheless, the more the country is per

The Romans are determined by all
means to ascertain every thinsr possible
about the Pope. It is announced that
the local spiritualists have been in coun
cil, have implored spirits to tome to their
aid and were replied to by the shade of
Pope Pius IX. which declared Leo XIII
had. a tumor In the pleura, of a papilloz
nature, and that- the cyst, for which the
Pope was operated, upon some years ago,
was reforming.
Professor Charles P. Grannan, profes-
; In view of the serious condition of the
Pope the Neapolitans have had recourse
to their most Bacred and seldom used
method of rendering him assistance. St.
Gennaro is their greatest saint and his
miter is preserved at Naples. It is said
to work. miracles. The aristocracy and
clergy of Naples begged the Archbishop
to send the miter to Rome, and he al
lowed It to leave the city for the first
time in many years. The precious relic
was intrusted to Mgr. Prince Caraccloto,
who arrived with it Baiely in Rome to
day. At the Vatican the miter was re
ceived by Cardinal Rampolla and Mgr.
Blsleti, who, with great ceremony, thank
ed the Neapolitans for their piety and
self-sacrifice in allowing the miter to
come here.
After the . Cardinal had Invited Mgr.
Caraccioto to remain for some days in
this city the sacred relic was deposited
In the sickroom.
"I know all about it. The news was
spread by an American doctor in Rome.
I authorize you to deny it emphatically
and to make the following statement:
The disease of the Pope is pneumonia,
followed by pleurisy, or, as it is com
monly called, .pleuro-pneumonia. To have
nephritlp, which means inflammation of
the kidneys, the latter must be diseased,
while those of the Pontiff are healthy."
The following bulletin was issued at
7 o'clock this evening:
' "After a rather quiet day, the patient' s
condition is generally, easier. The thorax
was again examine'd. There was, no in
crease of liquid in the upper portion of
the thorax to give indications of pleuritic
irritation. , The pulse was stronger and
fuller at 86; respiration, 23, and tempera
ture 36.9 centigrade. His mental condition
was brighter. "ROSSONI."
"LAPPONI."
HOPE TO WORK A MIRACLE.
A rumor circulated to the effect that
the Pope was suffering from inflamma
tion of the kidneys was denied by Dr.
Mazzoni, who said:
It was explained to the Pontiff that the
excitement of the last few days had over
come Monsigneur Volpini. who was quite
unwell. But the Pope was not informed
that Monsigneur Volpini was dead.
"What Is the matter? Why does he not
come to see me?"
NOTES V0LPINTS ABSENCE.
Later in the day the Pope received the
Countess Canall and the Countess Moroni,
hy? nieces, and after a short chat with
them asked about Monsigneur Volpini,
saying:
Pope's doctors after this morning's visit
and they assured him that the ameliora
tion which had taken, place in the condi
tion of the Pope since the last operation
was more noticeable than any which had
occurred since the Pontiff became ill, but
it was not sufficient to enable them to
consider the patient out of imminent dan
ger. The probability was that liquid will
again gather In the pleura, rendering nec
essary, perhaps. Several new operations.
The whole question was, they said,
would the' patient make constant progress
and thus during the intervals between
each operation gain strength enough to
gradually absorb the liquid which formed
in the pleura, or would his .weakness aug
ment, which would mean, ultimately, a
catastrophe.
To understand the sudden and' radical
changes occurring, not so much in the
P6pe's condition as in the feeling of the
publlo when rumors are circulated about
the improved or retrograde state of the
Pontiff's health, it is likened to an elec
trified condition of the atmosphere, which
has been aroused throughout Rome and
especially around the Vatican during the
past week of trepidation and anxiety. A
general desire to see Pope Leo win an
other battle and accomplish what would
appear to be a miracle, against all former
experiences and the laws of science, is
uniting everybody, Catholics as well as
others, In one supreme wish to see the
Pope out of danger.
A representative of the press saw the
Having expressed a desire hear mass,

to the sickroom, leaving the door open
so that the Pope could follow the service.
Shortly afterward Dr. Mazzoni, visited
the Pope and .confirmed, the .relatively
good condition of the patient, as observed
by Dr. Lapponi, with the exception of
the working of the kidneys, which con
tinue to cause apprehension. The Pope's
pulse was better. ;
On leaving the sickroom Dr. Mazzoni
Â¦was surrounded by the church dignitaries,
who were waiting in. the. ante-chamber,
anxious for news.. A picket of the Noble
Guard, in their gorgeous uniform, stood
silently among the somberly gowned pre
lates, giving a pleasing touch of color to
the scene. Cardinal Rampolla waited for
Dr Mazzoni in tho throne-room, and
when the physician appeared the. Papal
Secretary of State requested him to make
a detailed report of the Pope's condition.
After complying, Dr. Mazzoni complained
to the Cardinal of the gossip and criti
cisms concerning the doctors diagnosis
of the illness of the Pope and the treat
ment being administered. In reply. Car
dinal Rampolla said he had complete and
unbounded confidence in the physicians.
"This is why." the Cardinal added, I
never interfered in any way in the con
sultations." 1 . "iv"'-'
-On leaving the Vatican Dr. Mazzoni
was stopped. and asked, for the news by
Cardinal Cavagnis. who. with a number

Vatican for information, while other Car
dinals sent their secretaries for the lat

After this the Pontiff's face again as

Hope for the Pope's recovery has again
risen in the Vatican. Even his attend
ants have been able to enjoy much needed'
rest. Dr. Lapponl paid his lirst visit of
the day to the Pope at 7 o'clock this
morning. The Pontiff, at first, was not in
a good humor, saying he could not stand
remaining so many hours in bed. never
having been accustomed to He clown for
longer than four or five hours at a time.
The doctor, however, succeeded in con
vincing him that when persons were ill
it was necessary to change their habits,
even if they seemed not to be so com
fortable. f\<. ..'Â¦..Â¦
"But is it really necessary?" asked the
Pontiff. ,'
Dr. Lapponi replied: "It Is not- indis

efforts." ' f . :' " .

Pope Leo excuaimed, "Then we must ap
point a coadjutor." and he thereupon
solemnly declared that Mgr. Marini should
act as assistant to the man who was bur

situation was heightened by the coinci

ThrÂ«c expressions accurately represent
the difference cf opinion exhibited by
those who have to rely for information
regarding the Pontiff's illness on official
bulletins.
Cardinal Satolli. in a conversation with
a representative of the press, said that
life was kept in the tired body of the
Pontiff only by the constant use of power
ful stimulants, and othrr persons equally
reliable who saw the Pope yesterday and
fKho had seen him in previous days of his

ing that d^ath has made all its ravages
save the reparation of the soul and the

public that Pope Lt-o's general condition J
is satisfactory. i
PHYSICIANS ARE MYSTIFIED.
An explanation of the apparent contra
diction lies in the fact that the doctors
expected his Holiness to die long before
this and now are exercising in their bul
letins an excess of caution and a com
j^arative method of expression which is
incomprehensible to the Jay mind. More
over, the extraordinary of their
patient has. so to speak, annihilated every
medical theory held by doctors in Italy, so

The British Government has been
obliged to forego its custom, dating many
years, of holding no diplomatic inter
course with the Vatican. To-day the
Government cabled direct to Cardinal
Rampolla, as Secretary of State, saying a
cable message had been received from the
Government of New Zealand, inquiring
about the Pope's health and requesting
an answer in order to transmit it to

surprised if the see-saw between life and
death, continued for another fifteen days.
This afternoon the extraordinary nono

one to the Order of Deacons, in the pri

A dispatch from Turin announces that
even in that cradle "of the house of Savoy,
which wrested temporal power from, the
Vatican, the .inhabitants to-day formed
an imposing procession, headed by priests,
and slowly marched through the streets,
chanting intercessions. At the Church
of the Consolata, the Archbishop of Turin,
Cardinal Rlchelmy, himself a possible
successor of the Pope, addressed a multi

XIII. declaring that his death would be
an irreparable loss to tho Church of

The meeting will be one of the most

Interests of the wine lndustrv.
i Special Dispatch to The Call.
XAPA, July 11.â Congressman Bell is
making arrangements for a meeting of
viticulturists and wine makers to be held
in St. Helena August 15. All of the grape
growers and wine makers in the State
will be invited either by special or gen
eral Invitation, and as many members of
the California Congressional delegation
as can conveniently attend will be asked
to do so. The purpose of the meeting will
be to discuss and agree, if possible, upon
some course of action toward the passage
of legislation to prevent the sale of adul
terated wines in competition with the
pure juice of the grape.
Millions of gallons of spurious wines
are manufactured in this country every
year. It is made in California, and in
other States of the Union, and its contin
ued and unrestricted manufacture and
sale is going to result In the ultimate
freezing out of the small pure wine man
ufacturers for the reason that they have
not sufficient capital to fight the rich cor
porations that are selling the adulterated
wines in competition with them.
Attempts have been made from time to
time to pass a pure iwine law, but the
opposition has been so strong that all
atttmpts to gain relief by the means of
a State law have failed. The manufac
turers of adulterated wines say that a
State law, while it m|:jht prevent the
manufacture of adulterated wines in Cal
ifornia, would not prevent the shipping in
of such- wines from other States, and that
therefore the public would be no better
protected than at present.
On the other hand, an amendment to
the interstate commerce law which will
prevent the shipment of adulterated wines
from one State to another will protect
the makers of purÂ»Â» wines more effectively.
It is said that those who are now en
gaged in the manufacture of adulterated
wines in California will favor such a
measure.

DR. PIE3CE'S B.EMEDIES.
Sickness steals more savings than tae
burglar. Slowly, coin by coin, the
money that has been so hardly earned
is paid out for drugs and doctors.
Sickness is the worst enemy of the work-
ing man, and the common cause of the
working man's sickness is disease of the
stomach often involving the heart, lungs,
liver, or kidneys.
The use of Dr. Pierce's Golden Med-
ical Discovery will stop tlie stealing of
the savings by sickness. It cures dis-
eases of the stomach and other organs of
digestion and nutrition. It cures dis-
eases of heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, etc.,
when these diseases are caused by the
diseased condition of the stomach and
its allied organs.
" About ten years ago I began to have trouble
with my stomach," writes win. Connolly, <ff 535
Walnut Street, IÂ«oraiu, Ohio, "It rot so bad I
had to lay off quite often two and tnree dajÂ» in
a week, ray stomach would bloat, and I would
belch up gas, and was in awful distress at such
times. I have employed and been treated by
the best doctors in the city but got no help
whatever. By some way or other I happened to
get hold of a vial of your ' Pellets,* and I thought
they helped me. It was then I wrote to you Tor
advice. You told me that by my symptom* you
thought I had liver complaint, and advised the
use of your 'Golden Medical Discovery' and
'Pleasant Pellets' in connection. These medi-
cines I have taken as directed, and am very
happy to state that I commenced to get better
from the start and have not lost a dav this
summer on account of my stomach. I fetl tip-
top, and better than I have for ten years."
Accept no substitute for "Golden Med-
ical Discovery." Nothing else i3 "just
as good."
Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets regulate
the bowels.
Facts about our
TO substantiate our claim that we sell reliable
clothing at the lowest prices of any store on the
Â» Coast, we merely mention the following facts:
We buy our materials direct from the mills. The
cloth i? purchased in immense quantities for our work-
shops that manufacture clothing for our retail stores
in New York and San Francisco and for the trade
throughout the United States.
We sell in our retail stores direct to the wearer,
thus saving customers the middleman's profit.
This immense i volume of business reduces the
manufacturing cost. You buy at but one fair profit

For forty years we have been regarded in San Fran- W
cisco as the most exclusive house in the carpet and furni-
tijre business. We nave maintained a high standard and
our prices have been warranted by the grade of goods we
have sold. We have not catered to the custom that seeks
for display without sterling value; we have, made no
effort to secure the trade of those who can gloss cheap-
: We have deserved and held a conservative trade
among the people who appreciate real value, who know
; the difference between the true in art and the imitation,
! who understand exclusive designs and workmanship and \
Â¦ desire to possess them for their homes.
But San Francisco is now a great city where it was a
town when we began business. There are 435,000 people
! now where there were but 50,000 forty years ago. With j
i this growth in size has come a corresponding growth in j
I culture and art knowledge, and a great body of people
has sprung up who appreciate the best and know it when |
1 i they see it. . v ;
: To these people we intend to afford the opportunity
! of possessing what they desireâ^the highest grade of
I furniture, carpets, draperies and wall pa"per â at prices
they can afford to pay. To do this we will begin a sale
of our large stock on the fifteenth of this month and will
inaugurate a new scale of prices. % â¢*
j On those goods that we wish to dispose of before the
arrival of our fall stock we are marking prices one-fourth
to one-half off bur former prices. Everji one will have
the opportunity to add to their household goods some
piece of exclusive design in furniture, carpets or draperies.

July 11.â Firm protests to China from

resumed June 19. The significance of the
proposal of China to change the scene of

that Russian influence was behind the
proposal. It was held that the Russians
sought to have the Commissioners sit at

The court held that, notwithstanding
the ruling of Judge Kirkpatrick that Re

the New ' Jersey statute covering insol

gated all State insolvency proceedings,
and therefore Judge Kirkpatrick was
without the Jurisdiction to appoint a re
ceiver for the United States Shipbuilding
Company. Judge Putnam aded that the
practice of appointing receivers had been
so much abused that he was not at all
sure that he would allow it any way. He
said, that he certainly would not appoint
a receiver .unless some- provision was
made for the payment of all the receiver's
obligations, as well as his compensation.
Counsel for the Sheldoa . reorganization

a receiver, won a temporary victory to

The latest of . his exploits to be made
public shows that Woods frequently at
tempted to mulct fire insurance compa
nies, and that a rigid Inquiry into .Ires
tended to make insurance companies look
upon him with suspicion. After one fire
lit was found that some of the property
he included In his list as having been
burned had previously figured in a claim
which his wife had brought against a
railroad company, saying It was In a
trunk which had gone astray.
â¢ Colonel Best's sons have proof that
Woods was preparing to obtain money
from their father. When the young men
went into Woods' room in the Atlantic
City Hotel on the night when many of
Colonel Best's belongings were found in
Woods' trunk the woman threatened that
if they pushed the matter any further
she would produce letters which would
blacken Best's character. In her excite
ment she said Colonel Best had made love
to her and had* proposed that she get
a divorce from her husband, and then
they could be married. She produced a
package, of letters, some of which were
typewritten and had a signature which
the sons declare was a forgery of* their
father's. She asserted that the letters
were written by the colonel, and became
angered when his sons said they did not
believe her and that the signatures were
forgeries.

have acted in the last dozen years comes
to lieht daily.
Ever since Woods was deposed from the
pastorate of the Methodist Episcopal
Church in Port Allegheny, Pa., after a
court of clergymen had found he had
two wives, he seems to have relied on
his wits for a. livelihood. There is evi

SAN RAFAEL. July 11.â Each day
brings forth new evidence, against "Dr."
John Donald Woods and Alice Cloy
Wood. The authorities are piling up
proof of guilt and when apprehended the
couple will have to defend themselves
against a long line of circumstantial evi
dence. Up to a late hour to-night nothing
has been heard from the authorities -in
the East as to the : Woods' whereabouts.
Sheriff Taylor has been brought into the
case and is diligently looking upjletails.
He. will, 'It is believed, go East In a very
few days. If, in the meantime, Woods is
located, Detective-de Pue will accompany
him, otherwise he will make a hunt him
self for him. He is well acquainted with
the man wanted.
Just before the HIckmott expose of the

a case in which he had reason to belfeve
Woods was implicated. During this in

man and learned much about him. He is
in possession of certain data which He
will not disclose, but which, it is asserted,
will tend very mat6rially toward appre
hending the couple.
EMBALMER ON GRILL.
Deputy Coroner William Ward was on
the grill this afternoon. District Attorney
Boyd had him in his private office for
several hours and during that time close
ly interrogated him. Ward made a state
ment fully setting forth the details of the
embalming of Colonel Best's body. He
stated that he did cut the body open and
remove all the organs. He further said
he put some of them back, just what ones
he does not remember.
Boyd informed the Deputy Coroner that
he was liable on a felony charge; that un
der section 290 of the Penal Code no body
could be mutilated, and that from evi
dence obtained Colonel Best's remains
were most certainly mutilated. In an in
terview Coroner Sawyer said:
"I see that the Eastern papers claim
my process of embalming Is unknown. ,1
also notice they attempt to roast me for
using something that is not known to the
profession. If they never use it in the
East it is also strange, but I am informed
the best undertakers all over the country
use the same stuff.
"I have only been In the business about
six months and this case was about the
first good case I had. up to that time. In
fact, it was the Urst shipping case. Nat
urally, I wanted to make a good, job of it.
I told Ward to make the very best job he
could. Of course there are secrets in all
lines of business that the public do not
know of. Â¦.'â¢'â¢
CORONER'S STATEMENT.
"We opened the body and then tapped
an artery. Ward found that the artery
tore whenever he attempted to pump fluid
into the body: He tried it several times,
but the artery tore each time. Finally. he
told me it was no use. that way and that
he had better remove the organs and
work direct. I told him to go ahead and
do the best job ne could. He did. I do
not know just what organs he removed,
but he removed no more than was necess
sary."
"Do you think the fact that those ar
teries were tearing so often was any in
dication of poison being in the stomach
or blood?" was asked.
"Well, of course, I do not know. It '
might have indicated it, but Ward did not
tell me it did. I have had other cases
since which acted the same way. I will
say this, however. Just as soon as we
opened the body we telephoned to Dr.
Jones, who signed the death certificate,
and asked him if he wished to see the
body open. He said it was not necessary,
so we went ahead and finished our work."
"Did Dr. Woods give you any instruc
tions as to how to prepare the body for
shipment?"
"Absolutely none, except that he want
ed a good jobâ that the case deserved it."

Cioak and Suit Sale for the Second

"Why not take a Httle advice from
Beattle, an official of which said: 'We
Seattle officials have no City Hall ror
luxurious apartments, but are contented
to build up one thing at a time. Right
now we can boast of better schoolhouses,
better utr^etR, a better hospital and a bet
ter sower system than you have In San
FranHsro. Show the taxpayers that you
are putting their money to good use, and
they will not hesitate to go down into
their pockets for more when It Is need
ed.* " .-;â¢ '. "
"One of Seattle's leading citizens and a
high public official said to me: 'You peo
ple have a great park and a grand City
Hallâ perhaps two of the greatest in the
world. But that's all. In everything else
we can discount you. San Francisco has
been asleep, and especially so with the
business men of your city, who seem to
be afraid to devote some of their time
to municipal affairs cr politics. Many
would consider it a sort of a disgrace to
be associated with San Francisco politics
âthey may have cause; but let me say to
you San Franciscans that unless you do
ss we have doneâ remodel the weak parts
of your charter, do away with expensive
commissions and high-salaried political
positions and with a certain amount of
politics, and place in office men who have
business and professional ability Instead
of Ignorant political job huntersâ you can
never make San Francisco the great city
it should be, and Seattle will continue to
give your city the laugh.'
"I must confess that Seattle is right in
some particulars. Many of our officials
are only visionary howlers, who wi'.I or
der plans and specifications which most
ff the time prove a wasteful expenseâ for
instance, purposing to move Chinatown,
to beautify and tunnel Telegraph Hill or
to build a park on Twin Peaks. We mean
well enough, but are attempting to do too
many things at once. We are now con-
Kidering owning and rebuilding the Geary
s.trÂ«-t railroad, also municipal water
v.-orks and an electric plant; building new
isohoo! houses, a new hospital, streets and
rw.erf- and a. hundred other things all
at onec. This calls for an army of em
ployes at an enormous expense to prepare
plans and gather data, and what have
been the results?
FEARFUL OF POLITICS.
"The best part of Seattle was once oc
cupied by this e'.ement. but they were all
moved to an out-of-the-way district,
â¢where they are herded together and are
thus easily kept under control by the
authorities. The district where a few
months ago was the center of the tender
loin is now beir.R built up with fine large
buildings and being occupied by large
business firms.
"There is another point upon which
these cities deserve credit, and one which
Â¦we have not as yet remedied, and that is
the moving of their tenderloin districts.
On my trip I was told more than once
that our tenderloin was in spots, and that
the largest spot was in the heart of our
most respectable business center, includ
ing some of our best theaters. I had to
learn this from outsiders, and we are
laughed at because we drive these poor
unfortunates, which one might call a
necessary evil, from pillar to post with
out providing a place for' them, like all
other cities do, knowing It is impossible
to drive them out of any large city like
San Francisco.
vinced taring my investigations of these
municipal departments that there were
very f*w figureheads drawing salaries,
which I am sorry to state is not the case
hrre in San Francisco.
arPa ff forty square miles which these
< Jncials must cover, whereas we have
onlv forty-one. I was thoroughly con-
'â¢These northern towns have shown
that they believe ln municipal ownership,
as most of them own their water works
and other public utilities. All these cities
claim that they make at least 49 per cent
profit on their water supply and furnish
the consumers at one-half the rates
charged in this city.
"Portland has had bad streets for some
time, but the new executive board, which
consists of fifteen of Portland's leading
business men, who serve without salary,
now has nearly a million dollars of street
contracts und<>r way. This city has no
Board of Public Works Commissioners.
The City Engineer, at a salary of $200
per month and with only few assistants,
attends to all the construction work, both
;mb!ir and private, including 227 new con
structions under way. Portland has an
OWN PUBLIC UTILITIES.
Former Commissioner of Public "Works
A. Van der Naillen Jr., who has just re
turned from a three weeks* trip In the
Northwest, pays that after having vls-
Jted the different municipal departments
in Seattle, Portland and Tacoma, and
e\-en smaller towns, he has learned that
we are behind the times ln San Fran
cisco ln the administration of some of
our municipal offices.
"In Seattle I noticed." Bald he, "that
the members cf the Board of Public
Works, which Is composed of three mem
bers among whom perfect harmony ex
ists, do all the work themselves. One
Commissioner Is Superintendent of
Streets. Sewers and Parks, besides hav
ing: foil chare* of the street sweeping
and also the street sweeping p\ant which
the city owns. This plant Is said to do
splendid work, and that at a savins: to
the city cf at least S3 per cent.
"Another Commissioner is the- City En
gineer, who personally attends to all the
city work. Including all constructions and
buildinps, public or private, and also an
immense water system owned by the city.
The third Commissioner has full charge
cf the light ar.d power departments.
"These eentlemen I found are very
competent, and consequently good work
er^ being out in their buggies from 8
a. m. until 6 p. m. They do more work
fcr their city at an expense of $220 per
month than what we get at a cost of
5321 per month.
"There are a few of o-ur municipal em
ployes who are not paid enough, and yet
high Falaries are raid to a number of
offlc'.als and figureheads who could eas
ily be eliminated, thus saving our city
at least $135,000 per year. Seattle has
no figureheads in the municipal depart
ments drawing large salaries. It has
pchoolhouses and streets which are far
above anything in San Francisco. Many
Mocks of the main street, upon which
travels the heavy freight traffic, were
paved eight years ago, and appear to
me to be good for eight more. Seattle
Is undergoing vast improvements, and it
seemed "to me that more construction Is
under way there than In our own city.
Finds Sound Cities Ahead of
San Francisco in Public
Affairs.

REGULAR REPUBLICANS
OF FORTY-FIRST MEET
Besolutions Expressing Sentiments
on Leading Issues Are Passed
by the Club.
A meeting of the Regular Republican
Club of the Forty-first Assembly District
was held last night at 2768 Octavla street.
Ii was largely attended by members cf
the organization. As a means for can
vassing names for delegates to thi Re
publican municipal convention the fol
lowing resolution was adopted:
"Resolved, That the several committees
of the clubâ the executive committee, the
enrolling committee and the five primary
piecinct canvassing committeesâ be em
pewered and instructed to meet together
on the call of the president. and canvass
names to be reported to the club at the
next meeting for nomination as debates
to the municipal convention. Nominations
shall be, made, however, in open club
meeting at a meetlne of the club to be
held Saturday evening, July 25, 1903."
As expressing the sentiments of the club
in reference to the leading political ques
tions of the coming campaign, the follow
ing resolutions were adopted:
"Resolved, That this club disapproves
of- any Â¦ movement calculated . or intended
to prevent the holding of an official pri
rrary election for delegates to the ap-
p-np^ HE exhibition to be given by the
I Olympic Club at the Mechanics"
1 1 Pavilion on the evening of July
** 30 promises to be a memorable
event. A= a ladies' night it will
surely command the universal approval
of society. The club, appreciating the
importance of the function and realizing
that an immense audience will attend,
has resolved to put forward Its best tal
ent in every department.
In speaking of the proposed entertain
ment for the benefit of the Grand Army
encampment. William Greer Harrison,
president of the club, said: "The mem
bers of the club are taking an active in
terest in the coming exhibition at the pa
vilion. They deem it an honor to assist
the Grand Army of the Republic. All
Figns point to a notable success. The
members, inspired by the spirit of patriot-
Ism, are giving their time and energies
to the work in hand."
John J. Gleason. leader of the Olympic '
Club, is quite as confident and enthusias
tic as President Harrison. It Is an assured
fact that the club will present the most
attractive and interesting programme of
events ever unfolded to the ladies of San
Francisco. Moreover, the boxing bonus
â¢will not consist of make believe cuffs.
The club has decided that genuine hard
hitting, close up to the knockout limit.
Mrs J. Sewell Reed, now of Dorchester.
Mass.. will revisit her former home in
California during the National Encamp
ment of the Grand Army in this city. She
is the widow of the late Captain J. .Be^ell
Reed, commander of the famous Califor
nia One Hundred. Mrs. Reed was reared
in San Francisco and accompanied her
husband East when he led those, young
California heroes to fight the battles of
their country.
Mrs. M. Anna Hall, the national presi
dent of the Ladies of the Grand Army of
the Republic, will be among the distin
guished visitors during the national en
campment. She is a resident of Wheel
ing, W. Va., and has organized almost
every circle of the order in her native
State. She expects to head a delegation
of about 400 from her section of the coun
try, besides thousands who do not belong
to the order, but are coming to San Fran
cisco at that time.
Inquiries have been received from vet
erans from Wisconsin, Wyoming and
other States about land in California with
a view of purchasing and settling. John
J. Moser of Plum City. Pierce County,
Wis., writes for 1 information about locat
ing a colony of practical and experienced
farmers and orchardlsts. Moser and his
party are coming to attend the Grand
Army encampment, but wish to find land
suitable for farming and fruit growing
at reasonable figures in order to locate in
California permanently. Similar inquiries
from other sources have been received at
headquarters.
The California State Horticultural As
sociation proposes to hold a floral exhibit
in this city during encampment week as
an object lesson of California's floral
wealth for the benefit of the Eastern
visitors. The exhibit is to be held in the
grand nave of the ferry building, if ar
rangements can be made with the Board
of Harbor Commissioners and the State
Board of Trade. This is to be independ
ent of the exhibit of fruit and flowers
to be had by the Grand Army posts in
the old dining-room of the Lick House.
This is to be a joint exhibit of the choic
est products of the Sacramento Valley and
the foothills, held under the joint aus
pices of the Grand Army posts from Sac
ramento. Marysville, Orovllle. Chico, Red
Bluff,* Corning. Colusa, Woodland, Wil
lows and other places along the river.

candidate for the office who may be idea
tlfled with some other party, but becau.se
we believe in the Republican party and
in Its ability to wisely administer the gov
ernment and because we believe that r.o
one but a representative Republican
should* receive the nomination from the
party."
After the business of the meeting had
been transacted the following members
of the club made brief addresses on thÂ©
issues of the campaign: Judge Henry C
Dibble, Edward J. Prlngle. Silas A.
White. John Corbett. Captain Birlera,
Thomas W. Collins, Henry Parker. ThÂ©
secretary reported that the club mem
bership showed 300 names.
"Resolved. That this club favors the
nomination by the Republican municipal
convention of a Republican of unquestion
ed party allegiance as our candidate for
Mayor. We make this declaration not
because of any personal opposition to any
proachlng municipal convention on the
call of the Republican County Committee.
While this club opposes and will continue
to oppose all outside interference in the
Forty-first District, we are not oppos>!g
the Republican party organization as rep
resented by the official and authorized
committees of the party. We are Renub
licans and will support the Republican
ticket to be nominated by the Republican
convention. - ,,'
Governor Bulkeley, department com
mander of Connecticut, in asking for ad
ditional , rooms for, the use of the Connec
ticut headquarters, says: "We are going
a long distance, and more people are Join
ing our party as the time draws near."
J. S. Wisner, department commander
of Montana, has a party of forty, veter-
"Let. our delegation from the State of
Washington be so' large .that the. citizens
of the Golden Gate city will be compelled
to acknowledge that. we are a great and
mighty commonwealth, destined . In the
near, future to be the foremost State in
the. Union."
The Department of Rl\ode Island has
secured headquarters at the St. Nicholas
Hotel, where most of its delegates will
be accommodated during the encamp
ment., The party Is headed by Depart
ment Commander James S. Hudson, a
prominent merchant of Providence. A
number of the most prominent citizens
and officials of Rhode Island are coming
with the Grand Army delegation. They
will remain a few days and then go to
the Yosemite, thence south, and spend
several days in Southern California.
The Department of the Potomac will
come on a special train composed of seven
Pullman sleepers, commissary, baggage
and observation cars, leaving Washing
ton, D. C, on the evening of August 9,
going via Chicago, Denver, Colorado
Springs and Salt Lake City, and arriving
in San Francisco August 16. A very

ington, D. C. â¢
The Department of Washington and
Alaska has established joint transporta
tion headquarters at Seattle for the ac

TOPEKA, Kans., July 11.â Five young
men reached Topeka this afternoon from
New York City in answer to calls for har
vest hands. They say they have been em
ployed as clerks. They admit they are
practically without funds. Forty more
will arrive here to-night, they say, from
New York City and at least 500 men are
en route and will reach here, before Mon
day.

RAWLINS, Wyo., July 11.â All hope of
reaching the bodies of the dead miners in
the Hanna mine has been given up, at
least for the time being. When the
rescuers tapped the brattice which had
been built in the hope of smothering the
fire in the seventeenth entry, the gas
drove them back. As soon as the air
reached the smoldering tire it again burst
into fierce flames and the workers were
driven back to the fourteenth entry. A
new brattice was made and all attempts
to recover the bodies will be abandoned
for at least a week in the hope the fire
will by that time be smothered.
None but the most experienced are now
permitted to go into any part of the
mine, as the danger of a second explosion
has become too great to permit of any
carelessness.

at some unexpected results; After exam

come to the conclusion that Â» these crea

not possessed by human ' beings. They
seemed capable of going direct to a body,
of water of the existence of which thÂ«y

that the woman was found by the ghoul9,
who kept her a prisoner fourteen weeks

to death, expecting to sell her body. This

the body.
It is also said that Cantrill has informa

they are usually not well cared for by

which they are liable to contract blood

1000 of them are now Imported here In a

bird is $15. In regard to their linguistic
abilities, the importer spoke of an Afri

French, High German and Low German,

and the "red-head." The former are the

$15 or' $20, while the red-heads fetch the
same price as the Cuban parrots.

ages, but it Is doubtful if it is ever again
so much enjoyed as in childhood. A little
girl of most angelic disposition has just
given the whole thing away. She had
fallen on a brick walk and bumped her
chin. To her next door neighbor, who in

Computed upon the basis of deposits
less those of $37,274,500 of public funds,
the surplus reserve is $17,325,100.
Circulation showed a comparatively In
significant Increase of $1100. The daily
average of bank clearings was $218,000,000,
against $274,000,000 in the previous week;
the decrease reflected the partial stagna
tion of speculation on the Stock Ex
change and also the ending of the semi
annual settlements for Interest and divi
dends, which contributed to the large avr
erage of clearings In the previous week.
The loans of the banks were $17,3S5 ,500
in excess of deposits, against $13,551,300 in
the week ending July 3. Comparisons of
loans show that six of the downtown
banks decreased this Item by the amount
of $8,300,000. Five of these Institutions
lost $9,200,000 of specie.
The loss of cash shown by the banks
was largely accounted for, however, by a
reduction of about $10,000,000 in the item
of specie by one of the banks; this most
likely reflected payments on account of
the subscriptions to the new stock of the
Pennsylvania Railroad.
Loans were last week decreased $7,915,
200, and 'the deposits were reduced by
$11,749,600. Adding to the decrease in loans
the loss of cash would call for a reduc
tion of $11,221,800 in deposits; the state
ment, therefore, was not far out of proof.
The required reserve was diminished by
$2,937,400 through the decrease In deposits,
and deducting this sum from the loss of
cash, leaves $369,200 as* the decrease In
surplus reserve; this item now Is $8,003,
400.
NEW YORK. July 11.â The Finan
cier says: The official statement
of the ' New York Associated Banks
last week showed a loss of $3,306,
600 cash, while the estimates, which were
based upon the traceable movements of
nioney during the week ending with
Thursday, indicated a net loss to the
banks of only $434,000. The discrepancy
between the amount of loss as disclosed
by the bank statement and the estimated
loss was in part due to the fact that the
estimates took no account of the with
drawals from the banks on Friday of
$2,840,000 gold for shipment to Europe on
Saturday: The discrepancy also was
probably caused by tho fact that the week
covered by the bank returns embraced
the six business days ending with Friday,
while the estimates covered the six days
ending with Thursday.

Week's Close Is Par

This brick was the result of a fourteen
days' run at the 200-ton cyanide plant of
the Spearfish Company on ore that assays
from $5 to $7 a ton. At this rate the com
pany is able to clean up- over $40,000 a
month. The Increase In the amount of
the clean-up Is attributable to greater
richness of the ore than formerly, and to
the fact that the company Is able with
experience to get a greater efficiency In
the milllne facilities.
A gold brick that in fineness is equal to
that deposited by the Spearflsh Company
has Just been brought down to the Dead
wood Standard Gold Mining Company. It
Is worth between $4000 and 55000, but in
its perfect proportions and the luster of
the metal it Is the Spearflsh bar repro
duced on a small scale. It represents a
two weeks' run at the 125-ton plant, on
ore identical in character with the Spear
fish ore, the two properties being adjoin
ing.âMinneapolis Journal. .
The largest and most perfect gold brick
to be received at the United States Assay
Office has been deposited at Deadwood,
S. D., by the Spearflsh Gold Mining and
Reduction Company, from the cyanide
mill in the limentone belt. It weighs 1175
ounces and is over 900 fine, being worth
approximately $22,000. It Is seldom, that
gold of such fineness is brought to the
Deadwood office from plants In the hills,
and, while the office has received bars
weighing about as much, they have not
possessed the same value or anywhere
near it. The gold is usually associated
with silver and copper. The last bar
from the Spearflsh weighs over ninety
pounds, troy weight, is well formed and
the gold is of a particularly bright yellow
color.

Whether the tribe would ever consent to
the partition of their lands is doubtful.
They are a proud race, Jealous of their
customs and civilization. They trade with
the white man, but never mingle with
him In intercourse. Few of them have
ever taken the trouble to learn English
or Spanish, preferring to use the sign
language whenever necessary, and are
generally able to make themselves under
stood In this for all trading purposes.
What their life 13 In the recesses of the
reservation nobody here can tell. They
have not taken to the vice of drink,
which dominated other tribes, and refuse
to take the charity of the white man, re
ceiving the allowances from the Govern
ment only as payment for the lands that
have been taken from them. The men are
generally over six feet in height, tall,
straight and handsome, while some of the
young squaws have rare natural beauty â
New York Times.
Other men are said to have entered the
reservation and penetrated for a uay a
Journey, ooly to be met by tribesmen and
told in the language of signs that they
must turn back. They were escorted out to
the edge of the reservation, perhaps with
only enough of their .property left to
make it certain that they could reach
some ranch In safety, and warned never
to return.
There are traditions about men who
have ventured to explore the Navajo
country and get some of the gold that
Is believed to lie there in the beds of
streams. There is one that a prospector
once did find the mines of the chiefs
and returned to civilization with a burro
laden with gold, which brought him thou
sonds of dollars. He fell into the hands
of the gamblers here and lost his money
and set out again to duplicate the feat.
Within a month a Navajo came to Flag
staff wearing a hat like that worn by the
prospector, and persons who visited the
agency told of other Indians who had a
saddle and other possessions that seemed
very similar to those that had been
taken away try the venturesome prospec
tor. Nothing was ever heard of him and
the Indians always professed ignorance
of any visit when asked about hin f**Â«
The Navajoes, however, are extremely
jealous of their lend. They have been ap
proached at times by men who wished to
buy the privilege of exploiting their
mines, but the head men of the tribe have
always placed an emphatic veto on all
such schemes. They have paid constantly
that if the white men should once learn
of the riches In the mountains they would
take away the land from the Indians. In
consequence the only trading that the
tribe does with outsiders is in Navajo
blankets, which are woven by the women.
The gold and silver they mine Is beaten
into fantastic shapes with great skill and
worn by tribesmen. When the Navajo
takes a trading pilgrimage, however, he
lays aside hia riches and appears only' in
In the clothes of white cotton stuff, using
one of the blankets made by the squaws
to keep him warm. Asked of his wealth
he draws himself up to his full height of
six feet or over and gives reply only with
a contemptuous stare.
It is probable that at the coming ses
sion of Congress a movement will be in
augurated for the removal of the Navajo
Indians from the great reservation in
Northeastern Arizona. For years men
who wish to make fortunes in mining
have been looking with longing toward
the lands held by this tribe and it is now
hoped to interest President Roosevelt in
a plan to set aside certain valleys in par
tition to the Indians and throw open the
mountains to the prospectors.
There has always been resentment
among the citizens of Flagstaff because
one of the richest parts of thefTerritory
was sot apart for the redraen. This feel-
Ing has not been diminished by the fact
that the chief men of the Navajo tribe
and their so-called princesses exhibit u.t
the settlements at times bridles, saddles
and clothing weighted down with gold
and silver, which they admit have been
taken from mines on the reservation.
Far away In the middle of the tract
they hold can be seen a high mountain
which shines brightly on a sunny day as
it rises abruptly from the plain, and tra
dition that comes from the Indians says
that in this are found rich veins of sil
ver. It is called Silver Mountain because
of this fact. On a clear day it can be
seen for a hundred miles In Utah, Ari
zona, New Mexico and Colorado, and
many are the men. eagerly hunting for
gold and silver, who have looked at it
and wished that they might explore its
recesses.

Payne said that tho incident of Mad
den's publication of a communication re
flecting on. other officials in connection
with charges against the registry con
tract may be regarded as closed. He had
received a letter from Madden in reply to
a request of the Postmaster General for a
letter of explanation of the circumstances
attending the publication, but the letter
was not to be given out at present.
The Postmaster General added that in
spectors had not reported on the investi
gation of the manifold contract affair.
BALTIMORE, July 11.â In the United
States Court here to-day Judge Morris re
fused to quash the indictments of C. Ella
worth Upton and Thomas W. McGregor,
charged with participation in the mail
pouch frauds. The court held that "the
motion does not set forth facts of suffi
cient moment to allow of such extreme
measures as setting aside the findings of
the Grand Jury."
WASHINGTON, July 11.â Postmaster
General Payne to-day said that the end of
the postofflce Investigation was in sight.
"I am unable," he said, "to fix any par
ticular date when the investigation will be
completed, but matters have progressed
to the extent where I can see an end to
the laborious work."
The lieutenant's plea of- guilty was
withdrawn, the magistrate dismissed the
charge and the couple will sail for their
native country to-day.
"Now they have received a remittance
from home and 1 have raised additional
funds, which will enable them to sail at
once for home."
"He had a prescription for his wife that
he could not get filled. The medicine
would have cost only 15 cents. Being des
perate he took a blanket from the rooms
where he and his wife were staying to a
pawnshop. All he asked on the blanket
was 15 cents, just enough to buy the med
icine.
"When his money was gone his wife
became ill and he tried to get employ
ment as a teacher of languages. He was
in debt to his landlady and his sixteen
trunks had been held up at one boarding
house. It was impossible for him to get
a cent. He had been getting money from
home, through the German Consul, but
the remittance had failed to come.
NEW YORK, July 11.â Stealing a blan
ket to buy 15 cents' worth of medicine for
his bride, instead of meaning prison for
him, has brought money, friends and a
trip home to Lieutenant Friedburg, for
merly an officer in the Germany army.
The lieutenant was arrested a few days
ago on the charge mentioned. He admit
ted the theft and the case was held up
ponding investigation of his story. AVhen
it was called again a probation officer
said to the magistrate: "The prisoner
was a lieutenant in the German army on
furlough. I rind that he is of excellent
family and ha3 a splendid record at home.
His lather is colonel of an infantry regi
ment stationed at Hanover and when this
young man came here with his bride
early in the year he had plenty of money.

Why Are
Diamonds
So Brilliant?
Because they are the hardest mineral
known to nature. Science has proven
that they are of. a carbonaceous origin
and at some period have been subjected
to an intense heat and pressure.
The Sapph-Diamond is constructed as
near on the same lines as it is possi-
ble to follow nature. Sapph-Diamonds
are cut by diamond workers Â¦^exactly
the same as the Renuine and have that
prismatic fire so characteristic of the
diamond. Never sold under electric
lights. ...Their hardness is a guarantee of
the retention of luster.

"My lungs are free, my cough is gone, my breathing is natural, with
not a touch of asthma. I can see better and can hear better than I have
been able to do for a long time. My appetite is good and my food agrees
with my stomach and my bowels are regular. During my five weeks of
treatment at the Institute I never took a dose of medicine, and my treat-

BERLIN. July 11.â A medical writer in
the Frankfurter Zeitung gives some cu
rious particulars about .he white lines
which cross finger nails. These are signs
of disturbance In ' the organism at the
time they were formed. They often form
during serious illness. The proportion of
normally constituted persona who have
these lines on their finger nails Is from 10
to 11 per cent, while 46 per cent of crimi
nals have them, 47 per cent of the demi
monde, 43 per cent of idiots and 50 per
cent of lunatics. Sufferers from melan
cholia show a large percentage, but the
larxeqt percentageâ 75â is among those
who are periodically dangerous lunatics.
The writer comes to the conclusion that
these lines denote some degeneracy of the
upper nervous system; that they are not
purely physical, but are connected with
physical, moral and Intellectual change.
Are Marks of Degeneracy.
A still more difficult undertaking was
the great obelisk now standing beside
the Church of St. John Lateran, ln Rome,
with a height of 108 feet and a weight of
450 tons. But the crowning example of
Egyptian engineering was the colossal
statue of Rameses II at Thebes. Before
it was broken It was a single block of red
granite sixty feet in height, and it has
been computed to weigh 887 tons. These
The matter in which they excelled was
the transportation and manipulation of
heavy weights, a feat th^k appeals strong
ly to the lay imagination. Among the
chief examples of such work are tho col
umns of the temple of Karnak. To cut
a block of stone in a distant quarry, to
work it to a cylinder twelve feet in diam
eter float it down the Nile, land it and
place it on the top of a column of similar
stones, making a total height of sixty
feet, was no small enterprise.
Further, there Is a tradition that in the
dim past the Nile flowed at the foot of tn e
Libyan Hills, and that It was diverted
from that course to its present bed, and,
if the account be true, the work was of
enormous magnitude. The engineers of
the past directed the forces of nature on
a large scale, but to compare their work
with ours to their advantage "Shdws a
complete Ignorance of the science of en
gineering.
When the "laudator temporis act!"
wants to silence the engineer he says:
"After all, Egypt can show the biggest
engineering works in the world, and they
are all four thousand years old. When
you can surpass them, you will have
something to boast of." It is undoubtedly
true that Egypt contains the largest
structures in the world, and probably will
for all time. It is not likely that we shall
again see a building with 7,000,000 tons of
stone In It, as has the pyramid of Gizeh,
and it will be long before we have an irri
gation reservoir of greater capacity than
Lake Moerls, which, accepting the figures
of Major Brown, R. E., held 11,800,000,000
cubic meters (tons) of water between high
and low water marks. What the Laby
rinth was like we do not really know, but
Herodotus classed it as a greater wonder
than the pyramids, although lesser than
Lake Mocris.
According to the French leveling, the
height' of Niton above the sea at Mar
seilles Is 373.63 ; meters: according to the
Italian leveling, its height above the
waters surrounding Italy is 373.76 meters;
Four countries. France. Italy, Austria
and Germany, have each run lines of
leveling across their domain from the sea
to the frontier of Switzerland. Tha re
sults obtained have now been discussed
in an exhaustive monograph by J. HI1
fiker. Â¦ In this discussion he conclusively
deduces Â¦ the following figures for the
height of the stone of Niton above mean
sea level:
Ho reached this result by subtracting
from 1609.57 meters, the height of Chas
6eral above the sea, as determined , by
Echmann, 1232.71 meters, which was the
difference between the height of Chas
seral and the bolt at Niton. The figures
for the elevation above the sea of all the
mountains in the country were based upon
this determination of the height of the
stones of Nitron above the sea.
More exact means of determining ele
vations above sea level have been "de
veloped. The first great lines of level
ing were carried out by Bourdaloue ln
France in 1857-64, when j his levelings ag
gregated a length of over 6200 miles.
The art of making extremely accurate
levelings has improved as observers have
gained experience and their instruments
have been perfected so that for the exact
determination of elevations above sea
level, lines of leveling are now regarded
as more satisfactory than the best sur T
veying instruments in the hands of the
most skilled engineers."' :
For many years the basal point from
which all heights in Switzerland have
been determined has been a bronze bolt
which General Dufour affixed to one of
these rocks in 1820. Colonel Siegfried fig
ured out in 1879 that the actual height of
this point above mean sea level was 376.86
meters. .
In the port of Geneva, a little southeast
of the Jardin Anglais, are two erratic
blocks firmly bedded in the bottom of
the lake and projecting a little above
the water. They are known as the Plerres
de Niton, and it is said that in Roman
times sacrifices were offered up to Nep
tune upon them.

a plea to Judge Lynch when the Vigil

throat. It was the only case on record
in the county where the Vigilantes gavÂ«

the Austrian levelings give a height of
373.72 meters above the sea at Trieste.
The German levelings show a netgnt of
373.43 meters above the sea at Swine

The average of these four determina
tion gives the height of the bolt affixed
to the stone at Niton as 373.53 meters
above the mean height of the waters
washing the coast of Europe, with a pos
sible error of .07 of a meter.
The height of all the mountains of
Switzerland, according to the figures now
printed, must thus be reduced by 3.3
meters In order to make the figures con
form with the present determination of
sea level. Dr. E. Hammer, the well

torship of the Daily Telegraph, and his
wife, Mrs. Harry Lawson, is one of the
most popular women in London society.
Sir Edward Levy Lawson Is the owner
of a splendid country seat at Beacons
field, called Hall Barn, where he has fre
quently entertained royalty. Among the
many treasures which Hall Barn contains
Is the famous dagger which Burke flung
on the floor of the House of Commons to
testify his abhorrence of the principles of
the French Revolution. It is a mere toy
affair, made of wood, which was sent
from France to Birmingham as a pat
tern.
LONDON, July 11.â Of all the birthday
honors announced recently, the peerage
bestowed on Sir Edward Levy Lawson
fs undoubtedly the most popular. It Is a
recognition of the influence of Journalism
in public life and a personal tribute to
the proprietor of a paper, the Daily Tele
graph, which has always been in close
touch with the great middle class of the
country-

NEW PEERAGE A TRIBUTE
PAID TO PUBLIC PRESS
Master Mains was out shooting on April
33 a year ago in company with his friend
Charley Green. They had one parlor rifle
between them, and for the lack of birds
and something else to do Master Green
aimed the gun at his friend's head and
fired. The shot took Mains squarely in
the middle of the forehead, and in' a lit
tle while after he was lying on a cot at
the Oakland Receiving Hospital.
Dr. R. T. Stratton and his brother phy
sicians could. do nothing for the boy and
decided that he could live only a few
days, as the bullet had penetrated the
brain. But Charley did not die the next
day, nor the next, and kept right on liv
ing so hard that the doctors changed
their minds and said he had a chance.
At the end of a month the boy was play
ing on the streets, and last term he went
back to school and to the head of his
class. As the bullet, which is of 22-cali
ber, is doing no harm it is likely to stay
where it Is until its owner is overtaken
by a natural death.
These unpaid rebates amount from
$75,000 to $100,000 a year, which is almost
sufficient to pay the entire expenses of
the association and its bureaus.
CHICAGO, July 11.â Another aggressive
step was taken to-day in the contest now
being waged between the Rock Island
road and a number of its competitors over
the que5tion of interchangeable mileage,
when that road filed notice of withdrawal
of membership in the Individual Mileage
Bureau of the Western roads. Notice
was also given that en and after Septem
ber 1, the date on which two of the other
i cads have given notice to change the
form of interchangeable mileage used on
their lines, it will ray the rebates on the
individual mileage books used on Its own
lines. Furthermore, it has asked for an
accounting with the bureau to determine
what portion of unpaid rebates it is enti
tled to receive since it withdrew its mem
bership in the Western Passenger Asso-

'â¢Doesn't it give you a headache or make
you feel dizzy or drowsy?" the boy was
asked.
"Why, no," he replied; "I think I am
much smarter than I was before. I know
I can remember things better. I never
feel it. At first It usÂ«?d to bother me a
little, but now there is never the least
sign of it."
BERKELEY. July U.-To live with
a bullet in the middle of his
brainâ that is the experience of
a young lad named Charles
Mains, who lives with his people
at Fifth and Grayson streets. Young
Mains has carried the bullet for a year
now without the least discomfort. In
fact, the lodgment of the lead instead of
having a bad effect t:rÂ»ori him has im
proved his mental faculties, so that he" Is
now at the head of his class ln the Gray
son School. "

CURIOSITY
The Motive That Leads to Knowledge.
They say curiosity once killed a cat,
but If it were not for curiosity little pro-
gress would be made. A Texan tells the
following good etory about his curiosity
and what he learned about food: "One
day down at the store I noticed a yellow
package with a curious name, ' 'Grape-
Nut?.' The name fascinated me and
aroused my curiosity. I didn't like to
display my ignorance by asking, bo
bought a package and took it home,
where I read all about it. When wifo
and I tried It we thought It delightful
and commenced using It morning and
evening with cream.
"Before this I had suffered from lack
of assimilation of food and my stomach
was so weak that what I ate for break-
fast seemed to lie there a long time be-
fore being digested. I was usually in
distress and had no appetite for dinner.
All this has changed since my diet has
been largely on Grape-Nuts. I have
Gained steadily in strength, health and
weight, rlecp soundly at night and get
up refreshed in the morning. Wife says
I look like a new man and she herself
has been greatly benefited by the food.
"After my breakfast of Grape-Nuts I
don't need anything ln the middle of the
day as a rule, but I always keep a little
of the food handy and If I have any
cense of exhaustion I Just take a few
mouthfuls of it. It gives me Immediate
relief and does not destroy my appetite^
for dinner, but seems to sharpen It. It
surprises me that we never seem to tire
of Grape-Nuts, although we have now
been using it for several years." Name

THE Republican party needs to guard against losing an issue to the opposition. Fortunately
for it Mr. Bryan compelled the gold standard to, be a Republican measure, and the immense
influence and benefits that have come to the Republican party as a result may not be esti
mated. But the adoption of the gold standard- by no means exhausted the money issue. It
assured the equality of all currency, and made every dollar worth a hundred cents, but there is left
the question of equal distribution of that sound currency which is necessary to the economical use
of credit.
The Iowa Democratic Convention, in a cowardly way, it is true, but still in a way, recog
nized the need of more equal distribution and the equalizing of interest rates. The conventions in
the Southern States will probably be more honest and outspoken in the same direction, and Republi
can hesitation may make a gift of an issue to the Democracy, which is about the only one in sight that
can secure for it the confidence of the business classes of the country.
Mr. Cannon, who is to be Speaker of the next House, is in the field f against such legislation
and makes humor of it by calling it a "rubber currency," which is witty but not wise. We desire
to wara the party that this currency reform is a â¢Republican issue; made so by the * declarations of
McKinley and Roosevelt and the pledge of many platforms. If \Mr. Cannon can blow that issue
out of the party by one shot, the party will have rieisure, in. which to repent.
CURRENCY LEGISLATION
ism the poet inveighs against the mod
ern love, which considers offspring a mis
fortune and motherhood a millstone. 1 He
says:
God' g pity for the thine of lust
That bears a frail babe to be thrust
Forth from her arms to alien thrall.
As Ehutting out the light of day.
As shutting off God's very breath!
To love rightly Is then the poet's mes
sage. In some of the passages of the
poem where the charms of love are
chanted Miller shakes down his hoary
locks and waxes Byronlc.
The poem is aglow with artistic color
ing. The shifting scenes of the Golden
Gate, the Klondike. Honolulu and Japan
give a wide canvas to his brush. In verse
form, which is as a rule metrically
happy. Miller gives some wonderfully
vivid pictures.
Possibly the finest of his portraitures
depicts the frozen north In the clutch
of winter, where the vividness of the pic
ture needs only the stage green calcium
to complete the effect. The scenes of the
poem show that Miller can wander away
from the Sierras and still please.
"As It Was in the Beginning" is not a
great poem; it is a very good one. Its
name will never live for the philosophy
it teaches, fcr that is nothing but old
sentiments revamped. But it will be
eagerly read for the beauty, the riotous
color of its verse.

rectly by Messrs. Methuen. who are pub
lishing an illustrated pocket library of
plain and colored books. The binding is
of unadorned red. with those paper la

who loves his bookshelves. The specialty
of this series consists in the fact that
it contains fac simile reproductions of
the illustrations which accompanied the
literary matter in the first Instance. The
current volume, for Instance, Is "Handley

found seventeen colored plates and 100

Messrs. Methuen have paid very heavy

Whatever Justification may be found

SOME TIME ago a London scientist discovered by accident that a long-continued mechanical
vibration would cause the death of microbes even in an environment that was. otherwise
highly favorable to their propagation. Now comes an American scientist announcing that a
musical vibration of the right pitch will kill mosquitoes. Evidently we are on the verge of
great things in the way of dealing out life or death by vibratory methods, and perhaps in the end
we shall have vibrations of tine intensity used as a medicine, and those of another used as a means
of executing condemned criminals. ; .
There is nothing in the way of a joke in either of the two reports. The London scientist was
doing his best to cultivate certain disease germs in a laboratory near a large factory. He noted
that the most carefully tended of his pets perished when the jarring of the machinery made itself
felt, and experiments demonstrated that the death was due to the jarring. The American discoverer
of the deadly effects of music on mosquitoes has also succeeded in demonstrating the validity of his
statements, and in Massachusetts steps have been taken to put the method into practice. .
The Boston Transcript, in describing the 'discover)', says : "The new system has been given
practical application, and it has been discovered that a' certain musical note, raised to a great num
ber of vibrations per second, will cause the mosquito to experience sudden and complete paralysis;
and not only does this intensified note arrest the insect in flight or hurl it from ceiling or wall, but*
also because of a strange construction of the mosquito's auditory system it causes it to plunge un
deviatingly toward the spot whence the music issues. It has been found that the practical application
has been effected by raising to a great number of vibratiori?"per second the particular note to which
the mosquito is most sensitively attuned. This intensified note was produced by sudden electrical im
pulse upon a musical instrument, whereupon it was noticed that even'- mosquito in the room had
plunged headlong to the instrument; and that when the windows were opened the room was soon
filled. Again the amplified note was sounded and instantly in a cloud the mosquitoes, apparently life
less, were precipitated against the apparatus."
These demonstrations of the effect of vibrations upon living organisms tend to confirm the
theory now so widely accepted among scientists as well as among . philosophers that. what we call
"substance" is but a manifestation of energy, and that all life can be reduced to one elemental force
which science may some day discover. That phase of the subject will, however, not be so interesting
to the public as the promise that in the near future it may be found possible Â¦ to strike out tones that
will summon flies, fleas and all other. abominations of the insect world to their destruction as po
tently as that which hurries the mosquito to his doom. '

As contrasted with this Arcadian ideal-
Against the hollowness the poet finds
in twentieth century wedded life Joaquin
Miller has lifted up his voice. In no
treble key is it pitched either. From the
lofty crag of his inspiration the poet, like
Carlyle's clothes philosopher, fulminates
upon the huddled pack of degenerate
moderns.
As a thread whereon to hang his didac
tic utterances the poet runs a slender
wlfp of story through his poem. A great,
strong man, true eon of the West, stands
on the shores of the Golden Gate, look
ing outward to the stars of opportunity
which beckon him ever farther. In the
flame of his purpose he fails to heed the
caresses of the maiden, his companion,
who would keep him by her side.
The poet carries his idealized hero to
the ice fields of the north, there to fight
for gold until the cruelty of nature brings
him to death's door. He is nursed to life
by the maiden and learns to love her.
It is the natural man, the man of Rous
seau, whom Joaquin Miller makes his
Wealâ Rousseau's - savage, tempered by
th<? esthetic influences of all the world of
poetry and thought which is our posses
sion. The primal passion of love he would
have thus:
the mad course which his Pegasus
will run finds ample confirmation in the
last fruits of his unwearied pen, "As It
"Was in the Beginning." a didactic poem
in ten cantos just from Robertson's press.
The nature poet of the Sierras, the
painter of snow crag and mountain tor
rent herein manifests himself in the new
light of a champion against the sociolog
ical evil of race suicide, so vigorously
enunciated by that vigorous man who
holds the highest place In the nation's
Government. In a prefatory note the
poet declares that while Roosevelt was
yet in swafidling clothes he was cham
pioning the cause which has recently
pained weight by the oracular words from
the White House. With a frank recog
nition of the impetus given to his theme
by its latest advocate. Joaquin Miller sets
Mmself to the task of upholding the
hands of the President.
What Roosevelt has said in all the
baldness of a census bureau report the
poet has endeavored to clothe with idyllic
verse. "As It Was in the Beginning" is
a heroic effort to revive In the painfully
materialistic modern aspect of love and
the relation of sex some essence of the
romanticâ a bit of the Idealistic which
might soften the hard gray monotone of
these evil times upon which we have fall
en. The poet would introduce love songs
on a Jute into a third-story Cat. acces
sible by an electric elevator.

gangways, which are placed at the bow
end of the dock, hinged so as to swing
together. The side walls are fitted with
platform and protecUng hand rails to
provide a means of passing from one sec
tion to the ' other. Convenient ladders
and stairways are placed on the inside of
the side walls to reach the upper decks
from the pontoon deck. Light swinging
hand cranes are provided on each gang
way deck for handling material. There
are also provided fair-leads and other ap
pliances for handling the necessary lines
required for docking the vessels.
The original cost of the New Orleans
dock was $810,000. but since It was built
many costly and Important Improvements
have been made, addinggreatly to its ef
ficiency.
The New Orleans floating drydock has
the greatest lifting capacity of any dock
of Its type. In workmanship, equipment
and machinery, as well as in facility of
operation, it is considered superior to any
floating dock yet built.
Since the docking of the Illinois a nat
ural scour has set in under the dock, and
the continuous flow of water under the
structure has carried away all of the soft
material, leaving a splendid foundation
of clay at even a greater depth than Is
necessary for the extreme sinking of the
dock even at the lowest stages of the tide.
Several months' observation Indicate that
the scouring under the dock Is perma
nent, and that no future trouble may be
anticipated from lack of required depth
for sinking the dock sufficient to enter
any battleship that we possess.
The whole dock is operated from a cen
tral station-house on each side wall. In
these stations levers are placed by means
of which the valves are operated. Signals
are arranged by means of which the posi
tion of every valve can be known at a
glance. Each station is in direct commu
nication with those in charge of the en
gine and fire rooms by means of speaking
tubes, and thus the dockmaster has com
plete control of every^pump and valve.
The docking of the ship can thus be
manipulated without the dockmaster
leaving his central station. The dock is
moored by four stud link chain cables, to
each of which are attached mushroom
anchors. These anchors are handled by
capstans connected to winches which are
installed on the upper deck of the side
walls. The dock is also connected to
shore steel columns by two. steel lattice
booms, which are free to move in all di
rections to accommodate for the rise and
fall In the river, which is Bubject to great
fluctuations. These connections also per

walks and continuous trains, which were
in operation at the Chicago and Paris ex
positions, and which carried millions of
people along at a good rate of speed and
in absolute comfort without accident. The
method of operating these platforms is
well known. There are two so-called
"stepping" platforms running alongside
the train platform. The passenger steps
on one platform moving at the rate of
three miles an hour. He then steps on
one Vnoving at six miles an hour. From
that he steps on the continuous car mov
ing at nine miles an hour and takes his
seat. The seats will hold three persons
and will be three feet apart. To alight
from the "continuous car," the passenger
simply steps from one platform to an
other of diminishing speed, and finally
gets off at his station.

When some such a process as this Is
available, or a new substance found in
which radium abounds in larger quanti
ties than in pltchblend. the exact amount
of radium required to produce results
equal to an X-ray machine of standard
size will be necessary to fix the commer
cial value of the product. It is believed
that radium-barium of the highest activ
ity can be produced at the rate of K01
per gram, or $100,000 for 500 grams,' which
equals one and three-twentieths pounds.
In Utah there are large deposits of
radio-active uranium ores and compounds
that are about to be opened up. and by
analysis it has been shown that the
radium contents of these ores are about
one gram for each ton of ore. The de
tails for the chemical reduction of these
ores are being perfected, when metallic
uranium will be produced and radium as
a by-product at a very slight Increase In
the first cost of reduction.
The first practical ose to which radium
has been put since its discovery by ths
Curies is announced from Paris. Profes
sor Curie some time ago found that a dia
mond would phosphoresce beautifully in
the presence of radium, but that the
cleverest imitation of the diamond failed
to emit the light waves. Parisian dia
mond experts are now employing It for
this purpose. No critical examination is
necessary for the operation, as formerly.
All that is required 13 a small, dark
room, into which the expert steps with

at a glance If the object he holds Is gen
uine or a base Imitation. The price of
radium Is being gradually reduced, and
the price, which was recently announced
to be $300,000 per pound, is nÂ«w fixed at
a sum considerably less. Another Im
portant feature Is that this rare product
of the earth Is b*Â»ing produced in this
country by a Buffalo firm, which states
that It will aoon be prepared to furnish
It in quantities, but at the rate of $73,000
per pound.

rri HE prevalence of the divorce is a subject of increasing discussion. The frivolous reasons
Â§ for divorce which have been made good in law have been the means of multiplying the
I legal cutting of the marriage tie. The rising percentage of divorces to marriage is causing
*Â¦ alarm among those who study the social structure and the means for maintaining its equilib
rium. The growing objection to divorce threatens a reaction which will cause much human distress
by making divorce so difficult that it Jwill â¢ be . practically impossible in cases where it should be
granted. No woman should be compelled to live with a brutal man, who by drunkenness en
dangers future generations, risking blemishes both. physical and moral in their nature, or with
one whose infidelities humiliate her. Nor should she remain in legal contract with a man who re
fuses to contribute to her support. '
These causesMor divorce were recognized as legitimate in the beginning of the judicial sep
aration of the married. Their rise and overshadowing of the married relation were not inconsistent
with the entrance upon that greatest of all contracts from the most proper motives; for say what
th% practical people may, romance and conjugal affection only can sanction marriage. Without these,
no matter how many sacraments may supplement the civil contract, nothing can hallow it in the high
court of nature. If divorce were given only to those who married with right motives, with affection
and romance playing their part in the relation, divorce would be less of a scandal than now.
One needs only to read the court reports of trial of divorce cases to realize that a majority
of them are for the dissolution of contracts, that should never have been entered into. An astonish
ing number of marriages are contracted through fear. We have called attention frequently to the
number of women who are slain by erotic lunatics. Those tragedies represent the resistance to the
threats of the wretches who cause them. But threats often compel compliance and women marry
through fear to find that death would have been preferable. The erotic lunatic or fool never can
make a good husband, and rapidly progresses to. brutality, and neglect. Such marriages should never
be permitted. The man who threatens to murder a woman unless she marry him is unfit to live,
and there should be some way to remove him, legally or otherwise, and women should know that
there is efficient protection for them against such beasts.
Fraud vitiates all contracts and the marriage contract is too frequently entered into by fraud.
In a recent case the woman advertised for a husband, representing herself to be worth a quarter of a
million. A sucker took the bait, to find himself in the claws of a cat who proceeded to make life as
miserable as a man deserves it who will make such a contract for mercenary motives. He vAnts a
divorce, but the law should compel him to live with the Xantippc he married in the hope that she
was a female Croesus, and she should have the assistance of the town Constable in turning him up
and spanking him with a wet paddle once a week.
There should be more safeguards thrown around the making of the marriage contract, as
a means of curtailing divorce. Fear and avarice, as the motives for such .contract, should be for
bidden, and the state, being concerned vitally in the families that compose it, should be satisfied that
the contract is based on the only motive that hallows it, romance and affection. Nature cries out
against undue disparities in age, and the state being concerned in the future generations that are
to compose it, may well interfere to prevent those revolting sacrifices which have cupidity as their
motive. Divorce will never be less, nor the scandal of it be limited, nor the injury to the state pre
vented, until the cause is dealt with at the origin of the contract which divorce dissolves.

PARK IS GIVEN
TO THE STATE
SAUSALITO. July 11.â John S.
Nunes, one of Sausallto's oldest
and mo3t prominent citizens,
died this morning after a short
illness. Mr. Nuncs was a prom
inent member of the large Portuguese
colony In Marin County, and always a
factor in any enterprise for > the ad
vancement of his people.
The deceased settled in Sausalito
over twenty-five years ago and had been
prominent in social and political circles.
It was decided to abandon the art gal
lery feature of the State Fair for a year
or two. and next year the products of the
pumpkin patch will take the place of the
usual landscapes from the brushes of
amateur artists. The patrons of hus
bandry will conduct the exhibition In this
department of the pavilion. An effort
was made to have a secretary elected be
fore the State Fair, but It was decided to
abide by the previous resolution to lay
the matter over until after the September
exposition. Harry Lowden will continue
to act as secretary. .
The board appointed WY.S. Carlyle of
Wisconsin University and E. W. Majors
of the State University to judge the cat
tle exhibition at the coming State Fair.
Later on an aerlminous discussion took
place * between Directors Johnson and
Fox. the former charging Fox with at
tempting to bulldoze him, while Fox as
serted that Johnson had made strenuous
efforts to secure payment for a perferred
Creditor named Culv.er, a friend, while less
favored creditors had to wait for their
money. Johnson retorted that this was
an untruth and for a time things looked
squally.
Johnson said he had received an offer
from P. C. Drcscher and other Sacra
mento citizens to buy the Agricultural
Park property from the State for $40,000,
and to provide at the same timo, without
cost to the State, a choice of three sitra
for a new park. Johnson pleaded for a
postponement of sixty days to enable t)?!Â«
offer to be considered, but his motion was
lost. The vote on the deeding of the prop
erty stood as follows: Forâ Fox, Johnston
of Richland. Paine, Wilson, Whlttakrr
and Rush; againstâ Burke, Howard, John
son of Sacramento and Land.
Johnson assertf-d that it would bÂ« found
the society would not be able to realize
the benefitR of the full appropriation even
after the transfer, and he intimated that
thÂ« act presaged the removal of the fair
from Sacramento. â¢
cultural Park and pavilion property to
the State In return for the $45,000 appro
priated by the Legislature of 1901 toward
".he payment of the society's debts, which
amount to over $60,ou0. Governor Pardee
na.d urged this action on the score that
the terms of the appropriation required
that the property of the society should
be turned over to the State.
Director Grove L* Johnson of Sacramen
to acted as spokesman for the opposition,
maintaining that the deeding of the prop
erty would leave the society in worse con
dition than ever, since it would not en
able it to pay its Indebtedness, while it
would cause it to part with its posses
sions. Director Johnson paid he had
heard that Governor Pardeo would . re
move the directors "if they did not vote
to deed the property to the btate, but he
declared the Governor had no more pow
er to do this than to change the course
of the sun.
Besides being a member of the Portu
guese Union and the Socledad Corpus
Chrlsti, he was a member of the local
lodge of Foresters.
Mr. Nunes for .\ears had been a
prominent member of the Board of
Town Trustees, and to-day the flags of
the town are flying at half-mast out of
respect for the deceased official. He
was born on the island of St. George,
Azores, in January, 1855. The funeral
services will be held on Monday next
from his late residence here.

the transport Thomas Thursday from the
Philippines were a large number of
wounded men j four of them being minus
an arm besides being otherwise maimed.
Corporal G. H. Styles has lost his left
arm. Sergeant R. H. Brown his left arm,
Private Louis Lewsson his right arm and
Quartermaster Sergeant S.' S.- Hafer his
right arm. while his left arm Is badly cut
and crippled.
They were all taken to the General Hos
pital at the Presidio. They had partici
pated In the battle of Bacolod, which
took place April 3, on the island of Min
danao. The fight was a very fierce one,
and was led by Captain J. J. Pershing
against the Sultan of Bacolod. who had
constructed an almost impregnable fort
on the banks of the lake. The fort was
surrounded by deep ravines and high
walls eight feet thick made of gumbo
clay. Deep cellars were dug and numer
ous tunnels were bored, some to the lake
and others to the ravines. Here the Sul
tan intrenched himself with his forces;
armed with Remington rifles, Mausers
and death dealing bolos. He had plenty
of supplies, consisting of Jars of upland
rice, comote^ and water, and was pre
pared for a 11 long siege. His men were
constantly makinr raids and It was de
cided the only way to put a stop to the
ambush warfare was to make a furious
attack and reduce the fort to ruins.
In the movement on the fort were two
troops of the Fifteenth Cavalry and four
companies of the Twenty-seventh Infan
try, which had been stationed at Camp*
Vlckers on Lake Lanao; The battle last
ed two days, and finally it was decided
to scale the walls, where hand to hand
encounters took place. Most of the Mo
ros'took to their underground passages,
but In the melee Sergeant Hafer' was
struck several terrific blows with a bolo,
one of which cut his right arm off at
the;elbow: several cuts slashed Into his
knees, while his left hand was nearly
severed from his body and is! now In a
tadly crippled state. Corporal Miller had
his arm rendered useless and Private
Cosser of Company C of the Twenty-sev
enth Infantry was terribly slashed. The
place was fired and is now In a demol
ished state, and 'few if any- of the "Mo
ros escaped . unless they, managed to get

Eut while Mayor Olney says that these
published stories are not true, he still
refuses to say what the report contains.
"When asked for the substance of the
document he contents himself with say
ing that It will be jjiven to the people
in due time, and that inside of a month
the entire matter will be presented to
the citizens of Oakland. It was just a
week ago that the rumfcr started on the
streets that the report of Mr. Fitzgerald
had been received from Boston, where he
had .gone to prepare it, and it was as
serted that the report stated that the
only source of water supply in jHis
neighborhood that was sufficient for the
city of Oakland was controlled by the
Contra Costa Water Company, and that
the plant was worth in the neighborhood
of $10,000,000. The story carefully stated
that the figures placed upon the plant by
Mr. Fitzgerald, the expert of Mayor Ol
ney # were in excess of the valuation fixed
by Judge Hart In his famous decision
upon water rates. Mayor Olney refused
to discuss the matter at all at that time,
and so the belief grew that there might
be something to the rumor, and that the
famous engineer might have agreed with
Judpe Hart.Â« But Mayor Olney has punc
tured that belief, and now gives out for
the first time a sweeping denial of the
rumors both published and verbal.
The statement, emphatic and compre
hensive as it is. is most Important, for
up to the present time Mayor Olney had
refused to either affirm or deny the
rumors that have been floating around
Oakland. It means that the story that
Mr. Fitzgerald had said that the Contra
Costa Water Company held the only
source of supply for Oakland and that
its -plant Is worth between $8,000 000 and
$10,000,000 is not true.
The first and only official statement
that has come from the administration
upon the rumors about the report of Des
mond Fitzgerald upon the water supply
of Oakland is here made by The Call with
the full authority of Mayor Warren Ol
ney. Mayor Olney's statement is:
"The rumors and stories that have been
published about the report of Desmond
Fitzgerald upon the water situation In
Oakland are wholly without foundation,
and are merely a stock-jobbing proposi
tion with the hope of affecting the quo
tations of the Contra Costa stock."

It is the rarest thing for Mr. Sargent to
pair.t a tight skirt and the other por
traitists are following his lead. Does this
mean folds and gathers and full petticoats
for us all? The mode of the voluminous
pkirt does not accord with the fussy,
strenuous lives we all lead to-day. Im

committee meetings, boarding yachts or

Full Skirts and Fussy Lives
All the maimed soldiers are doing well,
but none of the wounds have entirely
healed. The patients are able, however,
to walk about the hospital grounds and
in a month or so expect to be discharged
and be placed upon Uncle Sam's list of
pensioners.
Corporal Claude E. Reed was nearly
cut to pieces, but survived two hours in
a semi-conscious state. Private Northam
was fearfully boloed and slashed from
head to foot. Corporal Styles was struck
a powerful blow on the left shoulder
blade and before he could recover him
self a fierce, burly Moro aimed a well
directed blow at his left arm at the el
bow and completely severed it from his
body. Two operations were necessary,
as symptoms of gangrene made their ap
pearance, and later on it was deemed nec
essary to take the -arm away from the
socket.
Some time ago Colonel V. S. Patton re
quested the Secretary of War to give him
an assignment in the Philippines when
it could be conveniently done. This was
before^Seneral Humphrey relieved Quar
termaster General Ludlngton, and as
Colonel Patton's knowledge of the routine
of the office of the quartermaster gen
eral required his presence in the War De
partment no action was taken by Sec
retary Root on the request for active duty
in the Philippines. . It was said to-day,
however, that Colonel Patton's request
will soon be granted and that he will be
assigned to duty either. In Maniula or in
San Francisco. Â¦ '
vSnce guard, composed of A Troop, Fif
teenth Cavalry # was passing down a
small ravine between bowlders and tall
grasses, it was set upon by Moros, all
armed with bolos. Lieutenant Manguri,
who was walking in advance on the nar
row trail, saw the enemy hiding and gave
the alarm, but It was too late. In an in
stant the blacks were on them, cutting
right and left, and all members of the
guard were slashed up before the blacks
were overcome.
It is probable that several changes wiy
be made in the offices of the quarter
master general shortly, but it is officially
denied that the changes contemplated are
the result of any charges relating to army
contracts.
Inspector General Burton left Washing
ton to-day for an extended tour of inspec
tion In the West. General Burton will
make an inspection of all soldiers' homes
on the Pacific Coast, but this, it is
learned, is only a minor part of the work
he will perform while away from Wash
ington. Secretary Root has received com
plaints from business men on the Pacific
Coast In regard to army contracts and it
is proposed to have General Burton make
an investigation of a number of such
cases. This will include an examination of
several contracts entered into by the
quartermaster's department in Seattle
and San Francisco, where, it is charged,
the law was not strictly observed in the
purchase of equipment and supplies.
WASHINGTON, July 11.â Colonel E. A.
Garllngton, inspector general of the De
partment of the East, has concluded his
preliminary examination of the records of
the quartermaster general's office relat
ing to Government contracts with E. R.
Lyon for glove's and gauntlets for the
army. All correspondence relating to the
Llttauer case Is referred to Colonel Gar
llngton by direction of Secretary Root
and It is made plain In the office of the
Secretary of War that he has placed the
matter entirely In the hands of Colonel
Garlington for a thorough Investigation
in accordance with the regulations of the
army. It is not believed here that ex
aminations of witnesses will begin before
next week, as it is said that Colonel Gar
lington will first Inspect all documents
filed with the referee in bankruptcy pro
ceedings.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
Contracts for Local Supplies
Are to Be Thoroughly
Examined.
Army Inquiry Is to Be
Extended to This
Several attempts were made last night
to Identify Zimmerman as one of the men
Implicated in the robbery of the Mills
residence and Frank Stenke's grocery
store on Point Lobos avenue. Stenke and
his wife, who noticed two men loitering
in the neighborhood on the day of the
burglary, went to the City Prison and
were confronted with the former convict,
but they stated that he was not one of
the men. George Shikaku, the Japanese
servant in the Mills residence who was
bofand and thrown Into a closet by rob
bers, said that Zimmerman somewhat
resembled one of the two men, but waa
not enough to nil the description.
A 'little boy named Allen, who lives
with his parents in the vicinity of Hayes
and Gough streets, says that about the
time the Hughes robbery was committed
he saw two men running down the rear
steps of the flat In which Mrs. Hughes
lives. He., will be taken to the City Prison
to-day to see if he can identify Zimmer
man as one of them.
After three days of Investigation the
police have come to the. conclusion that
the brutal robbery of . Mrs. Thomas
Hughes In her residence at 314 Gough
street was committed by Fred Zimmer
man, a former convict, now held on sus
picion, 'and a confederate whom the de
tectives have been unable to identify.
They have . knowledge that Zimmerman
has been working with a confederate, but
so far as can be learned the latter has
no police record. The detectives hope to
effect his capture within a day or two.
Jf. is said by the police that Zimmer
man has been In the habit of visiting
Mrs. Rubenstein, who lives in the sama
house With Mrs. Hughes and who is sup
posed to have had knowledge of the re
ceipt by -the latter of the $500 from the
street car company. On the day of the
robbery Mrs. Rubensiein was summoned
to Captain Martin's office and subjected
to a severe questioning, which developed
nothing, however, that would connect her
with the crime. Yesterday the alleged
visits of Zimmerman to her rooms came
to light . and' it is probable she will be
made to undergo another examination
and possibly be held in custody pending
the completion of the investigation.
Zimmerman will be taken before Mrs.
Hughes to-day or to-morrow in the hope
that she may be able to identify him as
one of the men who assaulted and robbed
her. This Is regarded as doubtful, as the
woman declares she got only a fleeting
glimpse of the man who threw her to the
floor and covered her face with a cloth
and the only 'impression she has of him
is that he wore a black beard, which ap
peared to her to be false.

The progress In the study . of con-

has resulted In my advanced methods
of securing permanent results." In my
practice 1 use special methods of Irrl-
' gatlon. and a method of my own devis-
ing for installations that cure gonor-
rhoea PERMANENTLY in from 3 to 10
days. I make frequent Inspections Â¦Â¦ of Â¦
the canal by means of a small elÂ«>ctrle-
light.- which enables -me to see and to
i treat each inflamed part separately,
Â¦ and I am also enabled to show the pa-
tient himself the conditions that actu-
ally exist Following my treatment
there are no evil after results. There
Is no stricture to fear, not the slightest
chance of a chronic condition . (some-
times called gleet), but there is COM-
PLETE healing of the Inflamed and
poisoned tissue. Never. use harsh in-
jections or drastic slnternal remedies Uf*
stop the discbarge, for if you do it is
certain that In the future you will find
your state worse than ever. I guaran-

borne Society, took the chata: at the recent
annual meeting; and conversazione. He al
luded to several of the many lines of
work upon which the association is en
gaged, to wit, the interest which it is tak
ing in the home counties nature study ex
hibition, the bird sanctuaries arranged
for and the protection of plants. Lord
Avebury claimed that near London plants
now needed more looking after than birds,
and anoted instances from his own ex
perience; he also pointed out how easy it
was for country clergymen to follow In
the steps of the great Gilbert White. Sir
John Cockburn also alluded to plants and
the advantage of the study of flowers to
children, saying that in this respect we
might as well be children. As chairman
of the nature study exhibition held last
year, he wished all success to the new
undertaking mentioned by Lord Avebury.
Sir George Kekewich said that of all the
objects of the Selborne Society he would
put nature study first. Dr. Bowdler

In spite of prejudice, the Japanese paper
serviette is making headway, and perhaps
it would become even more popular If it
were not for its . brilliant decoration,
which rather jars upon the taste of people
who associate the refinements of the ta
ble with spotless white linen. But the
paper handkerchief has . even greater
claims upon our approbation. A hand
kerchief which is merely an ornamental
adjunct to a lady's toilet is all very well,
but there is no innate daintiness about
the mouchoir and its uses. The washing
of one which has seen the service for
which it was Intended Is by no means a
task for the fastidious, and with our in
creasing: knowledge of the spread of dis
ease it is a question if it is not a reason
able sanitary precaution that all Buch
should be destroyed. If that idea once
got into the public mind the future of the
paper handkerchief should be assured. It
is portable, it is not - unpleasant to use,
it is sanitary and it is cheap. At the
price of a farthing apiece four of them do
not cost more, than- the price of launder
ing a cambric handkerchief, and there is
the original cost of the linen in addition.
Besides, as ev.ery one knows, our hand
kerchiefs have a mysterious way of van
ishing at the wash. â The Hospital.

The successive developments of diffi
culties in the financial affairs of the
newer industrial combinations keep
alive a somewhat indiscriminate feeling
of distrust of that whole class of secur

has been considered favorable and the
Weather Bureau's weekly summary re
ported the most favorable, week of the
season. But prices of the cereals have
advanced, and the fear of an unfavor
able showing of conditions by the Ag
ricultural Department s . monthly re
port has proved the dominant factor in
the grain and stock market. The ele
ment of risk for the corn crop by rea
son of its lateness has also been much
dwelt upon in stock market circles.

Understanding these distinctions the
visitor at a college function, watching the
long procession of notables file to their
places upon the platform, can recognize
at a glance the degree attained by each,
the faculty that recommended him for it,
and the university that conferred it Oc
casionally he may err in the last point,
for a man officially connected with a col
lege courteously displays Ub colors in his
hood instead of those of his own alma
mater.â N. Y. Times.
Matriculation at the college entitles the
Ftudent to wear a sown and a mortar
board of black woolen material, usually
serge. When he wins his bachelor's de
gree he may attach a hood three feet long
to his gown, made of the same woolen
Ftuff and lined with the colors of his
alma mater. When the bachelor attains
the master's decree or the doctorate he is
entitled to wear a silken gown and hood,
the latter four feet long. The doctorate
entitles him also to wear a panel, out
lined with his college colors, beneath his
hood, and to exchange the black tassel
on his mortarboard for one of gold.
Even thÂ« sleeve changes with the value
of the degree. The open pointed sleeve of
the bachelor's gown is closed for the mas
ter, and the doctor wears a round one
trimmed with bars of velvet. The doctor's
degree being the highest In the gift of a
university, his attire is the most distin
guished In appearance. He may.' if he
choose, adorn his gown with velvet'fac
ings, black, or of the color that indicates
the Fpecial faculty which recommended
him for the degree. White stands for the
school of arts and letters; blue for phil
osophy; scarlet for theology: purple for
law; yellow for science, and green for
medicine. Â¦ * .
The casual glance notes little if any
difference in the appearance of the vari
ous gowns, but the initiated eye can tell
instantly not only the exact degree of
scholarship attained by the wearer, but
also the faculty of learning that awarded
it and the university where it was ob
tained. There are other distinguishing
points, but the main ones may be sum
med ud as follows:
Some persons may call this peculiar at
tire a piece of antiquated flummery, but
even they admit that the sombre robes,
relieved here and there by the brilliance
of the hood lining* and of the many hued
velvet facings, lend beauty as well as dig
nity to the assemblage gathered upon the
platform.
At most college functions, and particu
larly fo during commencement festivities,
thÂ«Â» academic cap and gown are in con
ptant evidence. Undergraduates and
newly fledged bachelors proud of their
right to the distinctive garb, visiting al
umni glad thus to link arms once again
with a vanished past, the august faculty
body, and those of the official guests
whose scholastic attainments entitle them
to the privilege, al) don the flowing robe
and toj) it with the quaint and taaseled
mortarboard.

The effect of this development upon
the stock market of- the latter part of
the week has been aggravated by the
heavy liquidation manifest in the United
States Steel stocks in -face of the offi
cial claims of satisfaction with the quar
terly earnings of the corporation pub
lished during the week.
The decline in net earnings, compared
with the corresponding quarter of last
year. Is explained . by the prevailing
freight blockade in the railroads, which
But the most striking Indication of
this condition of the money market has
been the action of New York Central
stock in face of the needs of the cor
poration to raise capital for carrying out
the extensive terminal Improvements
which it has undertaken. The infer
ence that the J17.000.000 of stock In the
company's treasury might be coming on
the market has resulted in a precipitate
downward plunge in the market price
of the stock. The general mortgage 3 1-2
per cent bonds of the -company, of
which a residue in the treasury are
available for issue, have, also broken
through par. for the first time in their
history *o several points below.
The renewed weakness of Pennsylvania
and its breaks through the previously pro
tected minimum at 123 to 121% had al
most as much effect on speculative senti
ment as the slump in New York Central.
St. Paul's drop to li4VÂ£ was of almost
equal Influence. These stocks, as well
as Southern Pacific and Amalgamated
Copper, broke through their previous low
levels for the year and thus began the
uncovering of fresh stop-loss orders,
which had been pretty well up
above the year's previous low levels.
ONI/Y A TEMPORARY RALLY.
The temporary rally on the bank state
ment was of little significance, as the
loss of cash, which was expected to be
nominal, ran to $3,306,000, with to-day's
exports of gold still to figure in the av
erages. The satisfaction over the loan
contraction was an offset. Neither could
it be said that the weakness of the mar
ket was due to the Government crop re
port, the conditions disclosed by that
statement being about as was expected,
with the known progress of the crops
since the first of the month as an offset.
The reactionary tendency of the grain
markets to-day was evidenced against the
supposition that the crop report was dis
appointing. The market closed active and
near the lowest, the few late rallies not
being well held.
The dullness and hardness which char
acterized the stock of the early part of
the week gave way to sharp declines la
ter. The outcome pointed to the inference
that hopes were entertained that the eas
ing of the money market, which is usual
at the turn of the fiscal year, would bring
some demand for securities into the mar
ket. This hope was disappointed and it
became obvious that efforts to liquidate,
were awaiting any increase In the ab
sorptive power of the market. Whatever
favorable developments occurred in the
general situation were Ignored and the
selling of slock of all classes was freely
pursued.
The most notable of these favorable de
velopments was the showing of railroad
earnings made in the reports for the
fourth week of June of gross earnings
and the net returns for May. The coal
ers were conspicuous in the general ten
dency toward Increases over the corre
sponding period of last year, both in' the
net returns for May and the gross earn
ings for the later period. As a conse
quence there were some early advances in
the price of this class of stocks. The in
crease in gross earnings for the fourth
week in June, for the roads reporting,
was 25.54 per cent, compared, with the cor
responding period of last year. The In
creases in net earnings for May, compared
with the preceding May for the roads so
far reporting amount to more than 11 per
cent.
SPECULATORS ARE PESSIMISTIC.
This encouraging showing was ignored
In the general speculation and attention
was concentrated on the more unfavor
able factors in the outlook. The surface
ease and quiet in the money market were
regarded as somewhat illusory and prob- '
ably due to some other cause than abund
ance of available funds. For one thing,
money lenders are inclined to keep a large
proportion of their holdings in easily ac
cessible form, and, as a consequence,
there aro free offerings of. call loans and'
time loans for the shorter periods. It is
known that large stock commission
houses In Wall street, which have sup
plied themselves with time money for a
prolonged period as a precautionary meas
ure, are keeping much of it "out on call.
For periods of six months and longer
there Is an active demand for money and
extreme conservatism In placing It. The
situation is complicated with the week's
large outgo of gold.
The week's break in the cotton market
was regarded hopefully in the financial
district as promising to put an end to
artificial conditions existing in that mar
ket, but the later cotton market seemed
to show the speculative forces still In
control.
Another symptom of the underlying
hardness of the money market is the re
ported difficulty of securing funds by
financial syndicates and the high interest
rates which it is understood are being
paid. The current reports in Wall street
are that notes issued by the various rail
road companies sharing In the new con
trol of Hocking Valley bear interest at the
rate of 6 per cent, and a high rate of In
terest was rumored also on the money
borrowed in the change of control of a
portion of the Oregon Short LJne system.
NEW YORK CENTRAL'S SLUMP.
The closing out from time to 'time of
old standing underwriting syndicates
shows a considerable portion of the un
derwritten issues left In the hands of the
syndicates, and efforts to market these in
the open market have resulted in some
quick declines. The offer to extend a ma
turing 7 per cent bond of the Burlington
system for two years on a 4 per cent ba
sis was regarded as Indicative of the dis
inclination to attempt Â¦ the Issue of new
securities at this time. ;.V\;:
â¢ NEW YORK. July 11.â The stbek mar
ket was again subjected to severe selling
pressure to-day under the impulse of the
same motives that have \ prompted the
selling for the two days previous. The
pressure upon New York Central was the
most conspicuous feature of the market
and carried the price down to 114%. an
extreme decline from yesterday of 4Â»Â£ and
from last week of-11%. The attack upon
the markej was obviously in professional
hands, but It was equally evident that the
bear tactics were based upon knowledge
or conviction of the existence of large
orders to liquidate in the market. Beyond
the unshaken conviction of the necessity
of an early increase In New York Central
capital Issues, there was no immediate
news to account for the general decline
and it seemed to be based as much as
anything on a general belief that a read
justment of the price level of securities
must be made to conform to new condi
tions In the money market and industrial
affairs before any real demand for securi
ties can be attracted.

Hamilton L. Moulder, second son of
the late Andrew J. Moulder, died at the
American Hospital, City of Mevlco, on
the evening of July 10. He was a well
ltnown mining engineer, and his career
seemed exceptionally promising. Al
though only 29 years of age he was a
member of the American Institute of
Mining Engineers, and was engaged in
professional enterprises of great im
portance. Six weeks ago he was taken
ill with malaria at the mining camp of
El Oro. He was conveyed to Mexico City
and placed in the hospital. Subsequently
the malaria turned to typhoid. He had
been in the country of Mexico following
his profession for the past five years.
A few days ago his mother, who re
sides in San Francisco, was informed
by letter that the crisis was passed and
that he was entirely out of danger.
Shortly after this encouraging report
came the message by wire announcing
his death. He was a young man of
genial characteristics and eminent
ability.

For any one who will investigate it Is
impossible to make a mistake in the se-*
lection of a liquor cure. To all thinking
men it is evident that a treatment must
be established some time before the per
manence of a cure can be demonstrated.
My treatment has been established thir
teen years, and stands to-day the only
one with a proven record of permanent
cures. Others have attempted to imitate
my famous treatment, but not one can
show more than a few months' existence
and with indefinite results.
I refer by permission to the following
prominent men: C. G. Jones, Mayor; M.
A. O'Brien, Sheriff; Samuel Murphy,
Postmaster; R. W. Cochran, Chief of Po
lice, and State National Bank, all of
Oklahoma, O. T. John Hayes, Chief of
Police, and Judge Wofford of the Crim
inal Court of Kansas City, Mo.
Their knowledge of the cures effected
by my treatment goes back for years, and
they are thoroughly conversant with }ts
immediate beneficial effects and the per
manence of my cures. I will also give to
any one asking for them 'the names and
addresses of any number of r patients
whom I have cured and who have re
mained cured for years.

Captain Harts had been given a printed
form to fillrbut with the declaration re
quired by the Treasury regulations, name
ly, a statement as to the dutiable gbods
purchased abroad in his possession. Cap
tain Harts, after drawing his pen through
half a dozen lines of the declaration,
handed it back blank to the custom offi
cers. Inspector Stephens then proceeded
to search the trunks of Mrs. Harts, and
found tucked away in the Interior of
dresses and skirts 143 pieces of dutiable
articles, the products of Japan and China.
The goods were not laid between the
dresses, but were tucked within them.
â¢ The articles embraced two Satsuma
vases, one cloisonne vase, bolts of silk,
elegantly embroidered pieces of silk, sev
eral silk kimonas, drawn work, lace and
embroidery, gold lacquer work and silver
boxes and jewel cases. The goods were
sent to the Appraiser's store for appraise
ment. The law provides for confiscation
in such cases and the payment of a fine
amounting to three; times the duty paid

In a complaint for divorce filed by Susie
M. Mann against Joseph A. Mann, she
charges him with being a cruel husband
and also an unfaithful one. She says that
last January, less than a month after
fheir marriage, he struck her and knocked
her down on the street. She charges also
that last March he assaulted her on the
street and was only prevented from do
ing her great bodily harm by the Inter
ference of passers-by. Mrs. Mann charges
further that her husband spends too much
of his time at the corner of Polk and
Austin streets in company with Jennie
Mill. She asks for a divqree and permis
sion to resume her maiden name, Gwin.
In a cross-complaint filed by Julia
Blum yesterday rtie denies that she ever
treated Isadore*Blum in a cruel manner,
as he charges4ri his suit for divorce. She
says that on' the contrary, she has ever
been a dutiful and faithful wife and he
is the cruel one. They were married at
Napa in January of last year.

This is Mrs. Meyers' second appearance
in court. A few weeks ago she filed a
suit for maintenance against her hus
band, charging him with failure to pro
vide for her and their child.
One year ago. alleges Mrs. Meyers, her
husband's treatment of her was such that
she became fearful of her life and left
him, taking their one child with her.
She was gone two days, she alleges, when
her husband came to her, and, after
acknowledging his error, begged her to
return, promising to behave in the fu
ture. She returned, she says, and for one
week Meyers kept his promise. He then
became as bad as ever, she alleges, ne
glecting her shamefully and even rettis
ing. when she was ill, to allow her any
other care but that of a 14-year-old child,
who lived in the house with them.
Another woman who has found that
marriage has not brought her all the hap
piness she expected is Nevada Meyers,
wife of Jr. Albert G. Meyers. She filed
a suit fo^divorce yesterday, charging the
physician with treating her in a cruel and
inhuman manner almost continuously
since their marriage on September 9, 1894.
According to Mrs>. Meyers' compalint
Meyers has made her life miserable by
finding fault with her. She says that her
every act provoked him into outbursts of
viciousness and a tirade of Insulting and
abusive language. She says that he has
constantly treated her in a cold, cruel,
tyrannical and oppressive manner, and
has, notwithstanding that he knew she
was a frail, weak and nervous woman,
abused her most shamefully. Mrs. Mey- I
ers also charges her husband with in- ;
gratitude. She says that when he com-j
rr.tnced practicing in this city he v;i&
penniless and that she, to further his
ambition to build up his business, gave
him $500, every cent she possessed, and
that thereafter she stinted herself and
deprived herself of luxuries to enanle him
to get along. Now, she says, he enjoys
an income of from J300 to $700 a month
and refuses to give her funds, except such
as she finds herself compelled from time
to time to ask of him.
The couple were married at Butte,
Mont., December 19, 1900, or less than
three years ago. For a time, Mrs. Mc-
Elroy does not pay for how long, theirs
was a happy life. Then came a change
and from that time up to within
a few months ago, when they separ
ated, Mrs. McElroy's happiness was
but a dream. Their troubles date from
the day. when, alleges the plaintiff. Mc-
Blroy applied to her a vile and oppro
brious epithet. Blows followed the harsh
words and finally a beating that left her
a bruised, maimed and heartbroken wife.
Such treatment, alleges Mrs. McElroy,
destroyed her lo\e for her husband, but
she remained with him, hoping that he
would become the loving and affectionate
husband of the early days of their mar
ried life. But. she alleges, he continued
cursing and reviling her and adding to
his abuse threats to kill her. Her love
turned to fear, and after a particularly
violent outburst, which, she says, made
of her a nervous wreck, she left him.
Mrs. McElroy says her husband earns
$150 a month and she asks the court to
award her suitable monthly alimony.
Laura Charles is suing Charles Charles
for divorce for desertion. They were mar
ried at Sacramento in 1S06 and have one
child. Mrs. Charles alleges that her hus
band wilfully abandoned her and their in
fant child in July, 18&.
MBS. MEYERS UNKAPPY.
The matrimonial experiences of Edna
It. McElroy. as related in a complaint for
divorce filed by her yesterday against
Wilbur A- McElroy,/ are, if true, proof
conclusive that matrimony is indeed a
game of chance. Judging ffom Mrs. Mc-
Elroy'Â« allegations, she played a losing
game.
Mayor Schmitz said further that he had
no doubt that his brother, Frank Schmitz,
could take care of himself in the matter
of â¢ Mershon's charges. Frank Schmitz
when . seen designated the charges of
Mershon as being utterly false and ma
licious.
"The letter that Mershon desired me to
sign and thus exonerate him from the
charges against him is now in my safe.
I sealed the letter up, and do not intend
to open it unless there is good reason to
do so."
"When Mershon requested me to exon- r
erate him from certain charges his attor
ney intimated that unless I signed the
letter of exoneration he would publish an
affidavit which he had with him at the
time. I refused to be forced to exonerate
him, knowing the serious charges against
him, and I told him to go ahead and pub
lish that affidavit if he so desired.
"Mershon's affidavit is false" and mali
cious In every detail where he says I
asked him for the scope of the questions,
and I think this statement from me will
cover all that Is mentioned in that docu
ment.
James R. T. Mershon, ex-Clvll Service
Commissioner, who stands Indicted for
having- changed the rating of examination
papers of a candidate for a position in
the fire department, has made public an
affidavit in which .he makes serious
charges against Mayor Eugene E.
Schmitz and the Mayor's brother, Frank
Schmitz.
In the affidavit Mershon alleges that
the Mayor sent for him early in April and
asked him to. secure a copy of the ques
tions to be officially used in the examina
tion of flremjn for positions as captains
'in the department. Mershon further al
leges that he gave a copy of the ques
tions to the Mayor, who had the sama
copied. *-Â« Â¦
In his affidavit Mershon claims that the
Mayor's brother, Frank Schmitz, was a
partly to a scheme by which certain
candidates for positions as captains in the
fire department were given copies of the
questions previous to the official exam
ination, thus enabling them to secure the
right answers.
In speaking of the affidavit sworn to by
Mershon, Mayor Schmitz made the fol
lowing statement yesterday:
is absolutely no truth in any
portion of the affidavit sworn to by Mer
shon. You will notice that he claims that
I asked him to furnish me with a copy of
the 'scope of the questions.' Now, the
scope of the questions is something that
is absolutely public property. Any one
desiring to take a civil service examina
tion can go to the office of the Civil Ser
vice Commissioners and secure a copy of
the scope of the questions. Even if I had
asked Mershon for a copy of the scope of
the questions it would not have been
wrong to do so.
"I emphatically deny that I ever sent
for Mershon and asked him for a copy of
the scope of the questions, or the ques
tions themselves.

Two married sisters of Mrs. Schmalholz
corroborated her as to acts of violence
on the part of her husband. Schmalholz
denied making any threats, and said his
wife had him arrested so as to get pos
session of their property. As soon as
he had been arrested, he said, his wife,
accompanied by her attorney, went to the
house and took possession. He admitted
carrying a revolver, but satu it was al
ways empty. â¢ . .-.
The Judge reserved his decision until
Wednesday, but asked that the revolver
be produced in court to-morrow.
The marital : troubles of Theodore
Schmalholz, a retired sea captain, and
his wife, Sophie, of 425 Precita avenue,
received an airing In Police Judge Fritz's
court yesterday, when the husband was
placed on trial on a charge of threaten
ing to Kill his wife. During the cross
examination of the wife by Attorney
Bahrs she made the startling assertion
that their son was driven to commit sui
cide by the conduct of his father.
Mrs. Schmalholz testified that for the
last four years her husband had quar
reled with her constantly. At times he
would catch hold of her, she said, and
threaten to choke her, and he always
carried aÂ» loaded revolver. On May 26
he threatened to "lay her cold on a slab,"
she testified, and fearing for her life, she
sought protection from friends. On cross
examination she was asked if she had
not charged her husband with having
driven their eon to commit suicide. She
denied It at first, but finally said: "If
my son did the deed his father drove him
to it."
Messrs. Lahan and Doerr stated that,
having learned what they wanted to
know, they would present their report,
and that the San : Joseans will . give the
visitors a . reception that all will feel
proud of, and that with the aid : of " the
Representatives from Sequoia, Preclta
and other parlors stated that their organi
zations will hold open "house at parlor
headquarters for the entertainment of
their friend3 and guests and that the
celebration will be the equai of any held
in the past.
O. M. Blackman. president of the joint
committee., stated further that the com
mittee at this - end will make arrange
ments for a parade in this city on the
way to the special train and it is expected
thafr the San Jose Natives, will make ar
rangements for a parade in their city,
literary exercises appropriate to the day
and . such arrangements as . they may de
sire for the'* entertainment of the large
number of. visitors:
The visit of the Native Sons of the
Golden West from the parlors In San
Francisco, Alameda and Marln counties,
thirty-three in all, to San Jose, will not
be in the nature of an excursion, but will
be for the purpose of celebrating Admis
sion day on September 9. That was the
assurance given to a committee from the
Garden City at. .a meeting of the Joint
September 9 . celebration committee, held
last night in Balboa Hall, Native Sons'
building.
The parlors in San Jose appointed
Grand Trustee Barker, J. T. Lahan and
Frederick Doerr a committee to wait on
the joint committee to obtain definite in
formation as to what is to be done, as
the parlors they represented did not wish
to make any arrangements until they
knew how far they should proceed.
For their Information it was stated that
the parlors referred to will visit the cele
bration city on, the night of September 8
and on the next day will take part in the
parade in that city in uniform and will
do all In their power to make the day a
success.
- Another new body has been added to the
higher branch of Masonry in this -city.
This was the organization of California
Council of Kadosh, Ancient and* Accepted
Scottish Bite Free Masonry, under a dis
pensation from Sovereign Grand Inspector
General for California W. Frank Pierce.
The council was instituted with all the
ceremonies of that degree last Thursday
evening in Golden Gate Hall. The fol
lowing named were sellected as the of
ficers for the current term:
Frank B. Ladd, commander; Fred J. H.
Rlckon,- first lieutenant commander; A.
J. de Lamare, second lieutenant; C. E.

urer; Louis A. Murch, master of ceremo
nies; Harry R. Hathaway, lieutenant of
the guard; Frederick S. Laferty, first
deacon; I.- Rafenel Alkin. second deacon,
and William H. Hindle, sentinel.
fiie commander and first lieutenant are
thirV-third degree Masons, while all the
others except the lieutenant of the guard
and the sentinel, who are members of the
thirtieth, are thirty-second degree.
This is the third new body of the Scot
tish Rite instituted In this city since Oc
tober last. The first was California
Lodge of Perfection, which already has a
membership of nearly 200. This indicates
strenuous work on the part of the organ
izers and the members. The second body,
California Chapter of Rose Croix, was in
stituted on February 10. The membership
of this body has grown to' such a degree
as to call for the next higher rank, which
is that of the Knights Kadosh, or the
thirtieth degree, which will be conferred
July 22. '
. The organizers of the Kadosh are the
same who organize the other bodies, with
the exception of First Deacon Laf arty,
who is a demit from the Portland bodies,
and Second Deacon Aikln, who is the'su
perintendent of the Masonic Widows' and
Orphans* Home at Decoto. The new of
ficers have perfected ' themselves In the

KSATZ BROTHEES TO STAND
TRIAL IN SUPERIOR COITRT
The Supreme Court yesterday sustained
the claim of David Jacks to about 00,000
acres of land surrounding the city of
Monterey. The property cost a trifle more
than $1000 and is worth approximately
1200,000. The dispute has been in the
courts for many years.
Monterey was founded on a pueblo
grant before California was ceded to the
United States. After annexation the title
to the property on which the town was
located was vested in the municipal cor
poration. Early in the '50's the United
States contested the title of Monterey to
a portion of the pueblo grant. An attor
ney named Asher defended the suit. After
extensive litigation be won his point. He
presented a claim for services, and the
city's governing body ordered that he be
paid. There was no money In the treas
ury with which to satisfy the claim,
however. Finally it was decided to auc
tion off come land which was a part of
the original pueblo grant In order that
money might be raised with which to pay
Asher. ThÂ» attorney bid in the property
himself for $1053 85. Subsequently he
transferred his holdings to David Jacks.
That all happened more than half a cen
tury ago, when land was not worth quite
what it is at present.
When a charter was granted Monterey
it was explicitly stated therein that the
citv had disposed of the lands claimed
by Jacks. The Supreme Court holds that
this fact would make the sale valid, even
if the previous transactions had not been
legal, which in the opinion of the court
they probably were.
When the property became valuable
both the city and Jacks laid claim to it
and carried their dispute to the courts.
Every point has been bitterly contested,
and the litigation has been In consequence
very protracted.
The claims of Jacks were sustained in
the Superior Court, and an appeal on be
half of Monterey was taken to the Su
preme Court. The higher tribunal re
fuses to order a reversal. As some Fed
eral points are involved in the case an
other appeal is likely to be taken to the
United States Supreme Court
In the opinion rendered yesterday the
claims of the contestants are reviewed at
length, and almost every argument intro
duced by the various attorneys interested
is considered. The land which Jacks has
won lies on the outskirts of the city and
is of great and constantly increasing
value. It will give good returns on the
thousand and odd dollars invested.
The decision of the court implies that
the title of the city of Monterey is de
fective. Other suits would have to be in
stituted before that point could be settled,
however. Prominent attorneys who have
studied the case are of the opinion that
the courts would uphold the title of Mon
terey to the site on which the city is
built

Aidridge, a bartender, while the detec
tives are busily engaged in an effort to
dig up evidence to show that the woman
end her corrrar.ien are guilty of stealing
more than SIM worth of goods from Wil
liam Baron, who keeps a cloak store on
Market street.
The women and her consort wece ar
rested yesterday afternoon by Detective
O'Day on complaint cf Baron, who has
fuJTered the loss of a number cf high
rrieed dresses and skins since he cm
ployed the fair one as a Faleslady in his
Â«:-tab!ishmerit a few we*-ks ago. The
v.oxr<an admits her guilt, but says nothing
fcrther. Baron fays he will be satisfied
If be gets the stolen property back and
; V.> that he will not prosecute her, no
matter what turn affairs take.
Three wrt-ks ago Baron placed an ad
rertlsessesxt in the papers for a saleslady.
The r.t-xt morning bright and early Mrs.
.Aidridge applied for the position. She
made a good appearance and Baron hired
bet D the spot.
The new saleslady had not been in the
p'.ac<-- very lnr.g ere the proprietor began
to miss things. First a' skirt disappeared,
then several yards cf cloth dropped out
cf sight. The thefts became more numer
ous as the- da>s went by and the propri
etor became j.prplexed. lie had an idea
that his oew saleslady was robbing him,
liut had no evidence to base his suspicions
on.
COSTLY DRESS DISAPPEARS.
Matters came to a climax, however, on
Friday afternoon. One of Baron's cus
tomers left a handsome drrss, valued at
$75. to be altered, stating that she would
tall for it in ;i few days. That afternoon
the young lady who did the wrapping at
the store wa^ off. M Miss AJdriÂ£ge asked
for the place and was given it.
Shortly afterward a messenger boy
called at the place with an order presum
ably from the lady who left the suit, ask
ing that it be given .to the bearer. Mr?.
Aldridge was In charge of the wrapping
desk, at the time and immediately gave
the euit to the boy. Barcn asked her if
the charges against it had been paid and
hhe replied In ;l;e affirmative, at the same
time Â¦bowing him a tas\ correctly made
Â«;ut. That night when Baron was (eroins
over his accounts he discovered that he
was short and that the suit had not been
paid for. His tUi-jiScions became aroused,
fo he huntod up his new saleslady and
taxed her with making away with the
hull.
WOMAN ADMITS GUILT.
The woman admitted that she was
guilty and stated that the had sent it to
a man named H. Lewis in Los Angeles.
ThÂ«-n Baron reported the matter to- the
police and Detective Harry ODea was
*ent out to investigate. He found the
woman In company with her companion
In a bowling alley In the tenderloin dis
trict and placed them both under arnÂ«Â»t.
The man admitted that he had received
feveraJ stolen articles from the saleslady
and he produced one of the stolen skirts.
It is the opinion of the detective that the
woman has been working her game for
tome time i>a.in and that the goods were
turned over to Aidridge, who disposed of
them.
The woman Is tall and striking-, of the
brunette type and apparently about 22
years of age. She claims to have arrived
only recently from Los Angeles, but it
1* aliened that she has been a familiar
J.gure on the tenderloin for some time
pa.-t.
When seen at the City Prison last night
Mrs. Aidridjre stated that she had been
leu astray by H. Lewis, the man to whom
the had sent the stolen suit at Los An
geles. She says that the man has exerted
tome kind of Influence over her all the
time and that she could not resist him
arsd had to do his bidding whenever he
a.-ked her. Mrs. Aidridge added that
Lewis had left the city several days ago,
but she expects that he will soon return.
The Commissioners had applications
from many convicts who had long terms
to serve, and owing to this fact they
declined to free them, despite the fact
their conduct in prison been exem
plary. They deemed it better to wait
until the aDDlicants had not more than
a year to serve before granting them a
parole.
The application for parole of A. C. Wid
ber. ex -Treasurer of this city;" who was
convicted t>f embezzlement, was not
reached. Wldber desires to be paroled
although his sentence expires next Janu
ary- Wldber is at present employed as

ment.
John Heitel, convicted of arson in Napa
County, who had five months to serve.
secured his release. John Buchanan, con
victed of robbery in Colusa County, who
had two months to serve, was allowed
his liberty. W. F. Rau. cpnvlcted for
assault in this city, secured freedom. He
had a year and a half to serve, but on
the earnest recommendation of Judge
Lawlor he was granted a parole. Wal
ter Brady, convicted for burglary in San
Joaquin County, was also released. Wal
ter Thompson, who was given alx years
for robbery in Sonoma County, and who
had two years to serve, was allowed to
go. Jesse T. Sutton, convicted of man
slaughter In Colusa County, was also
given his liberty. He still had two year3
to serve. Relatives appeared before the
board in behalf of the prisoner and their
appeals were heeded. Frank Lewis, also
convicted .for manslaughter, was given
the liberty he coveted. He had eleven
months more to serve, but the Commis
sioners deemed it advisable to give hftn
another chance.
Minor matters were discussed in open
session. After the approval of the min
utes of. the last meeting the Commis
sioners went Into executive session and
remained until adjournment.
Fourteen applications for parole were
examined and seven were granted.
The meeting was attended by Commis
sioners Fitzgerald. ex-United States Sen
ator Charles N. Felton. Don Ray and
James H. Wilkins. Senator Robert T.
Devlin Is traveling in Europe and was
therefore absent.
f "The current monthly business relating
to both prisons took up so muoh of the
board's time to-day that we did not get
an opportunity to consider the Warden
ship at San Quentln until It was about
time to leave for the city. The subject,
however, was briefly and frankly dealt
with. I suggested a special meeting next
Tuesday, but after interchange of viewa
concerning the time most convenient for
all the members cf the board, it was re
solved to defer action until next Satur
day forenoon. The meeting is called for
that time and for the purpose cf electing
a Warden at San Quentln and for that
purpose only. No other business can In
tervene to divert attention of the board
from the main issue. There is no objec
tion whatever to a public announcement
of this fact. The members of the board
impose "no obligation of secrecy in this
respect. We are to meet next Saturday
to settle the question of the Wardenship
at San Quentin."
Owing to the pressure of accumulated
business the State Prison Directors at
their session yesterday were unable to
reach the Important question of the San
Quentln Wardenship until but a few min
utes before evening train time.
Director Charles N. Felton. however,
brought the subject to the attention of
the board, and it was agreed that the
question should be taken up and finally
settled at a special meeting to be helfl at
Fitzgera!d"s law office in this
city next Saturday forenoon.

evening Mr. Felton said:

sert that they are more than ever con
vinced that the company has suffered
through the acts of, unknown miscreants.
They do not hesitate to place the respon
sibility for the disasters upon wreckers of
trains, who, for some reason unknown to
them, sought to destroy lives and prop
erty. The identity of these alleged per
sons has not been discovered, even in the
remotest degree, but the detectives are
working on fragments of evidence which,
they hope will be fruitful of results.
What object any one could â¢ possibly
have had to endanger the lives of passen
gers, as well as'to cause tremendous loss
to the company, is unexplained, but the
detectives think some discharged em
ploye may have permitted his resentment
to reach to that extreme of revenge.
Inquiry among the residents of the com
munities adjacent to the disaster has not
so far aided the company in the detection
of enemies. A thorough scrutiny of the
Implements most. recently used in the ob
struction of the tracks furnishes no clew
to the perpetrators of the crime. In fact,
the only tangible evidence that has thus
far been obtained by the detectives is
some, copper wire, which was used to
SAN RAFAEL, July 11.â The' detec

Shore Railroad who have been
With all this, however, 'the company
has been most unfortunate, and within
the last month four lives have been sacri
ficed, nearly thirty persons have been
badly inured and the company has sus
tained property losses approximating
5X50,000.
The company has, according to its state
ment, been bothered with obstructions
upon the right of way as far back as
May 1. The Inspectors were continually
finding something wrong on the line.
Fishplate bolts were often loosened, grass
llres were frequently encounterea In
proximity to high trestles and various
other obstacles seemed to be ever In the
way of the train service.
In the early part of May cordwood was
found upon the rails and trackwalkers
had to be most diligent in order to avert
disaster. Pony trucks of engines some
times jumped the track without apparent
cause. Nearly all of these occurrences
were noted between Camp Taylor and
fasten the piece of rail to the- track on
July 1, and which was found the follow
ing morning by Trackwalker Gamanlni.
No such kind of wire can be found in any
of the company's warehouses oc machine
shops and the officials believe it was ob
tained in some other county. The wire
cannot be matched in any of the country
stores in the various tov/ns along the en
tire system, but it is used extensively by
San Francisco electrical workers. By this
piece of wire and by the footprints" adja
cent to the track where the cow caused
the derailment, of .engine No. 8, the de
tectives will endeavor to run down the
supposed criminals.'-'.
"When the present management took
hold of the narrow-gauge system the en
tire roadbed on the'Cazadero branch was
overhauled and improved,, while the line
from Sausalltb ;to San, Rafael, including
the Mill Valley branch, was entirely re
built.' The' up-country â¢ track- was relaid,
the trestles repaired and various other
improvements were made. Telegraph sta
tions were established at new points along
the line and operators were installed, to
prevent collision of trains. Trackwalkers
and road Â¦ inspectors with motor cycles
were innovations under, the new regime.
All precautions, the company declares,
were taken to avert disaster.
Three days later the up-country Caza
dero passenger train, with 175 passengers
on board, was wrecked near Tocaloma.
about' three miles from where the . other
wreck occurred. This time Engineer John
Williams was killed, Fireman Robert
Clark was seriously injured and other
passengers were more or less bruised.
On July 2 a large piece of rail was
found fastened to the outside rail of a
curve near Camp Pistoles!, but caused no
damage. On Sunday night, July 6. a pas
senger train was derailed near Camp Pl3
tolesi and Engineer Fred Hamilton was
killed. This time a dead cow upon the
track was accounted the cause. It was
supposed at the time that the bovine had
died on the companys right of way. but
investigation is declared to have shown
that the cow was placed there. Marks of
where it was dragged from a gateway
are said to be in evidence still, and the
company's detectives claim they have a
clew to the identity of guilty persons.
Two days later. July 8, the up-country
passenger train collided with a large
iron "drawhead," which had been placed
upon the track, and Engineer Cannady
narrowly averted a disaster. As It was,
the locomotive was derailed.
These numerous accidents and seem
ing attempts at the derailment of trains,
occurring within a few miles of one
another, have made the railroad officials
suspicious of designs upon the corpora
tion by persons, who in malice hesitate
not at murder. The authorities of the
railroad say they will leave nothing un
done to ascertain the facts.
It was on May 21 that a special train
conveying mourners from the funeral of
John Dutton was hurled off a high trestle
near Point Reyes and Anton Roman and

CHICAGO, July 11.â Monarka, at odds
of 10 to 1, won the Young handicap at
Washington Park to-day in a desperate
drive from Lucien Appleby, with Hood
wink a length back. The event was the
best betting race of the season, all of the
horses having backers. It was also one
of the best races seen on the local tracks
this year. Monarka was given a perfect
ride by Jockey Helgesen, who placed his
mount in a rear position until the stretch
turn was reached, when he began over
hauling the leaders, winning at the wire
by a neck from Lucien Appleby.
Starter Dwyer made tho worst start of
his career in the first race, of eight en
tries: The s heavily played favorite,
Stuyve, was practically left at the post.
Stuyve was turned the wrong way when
the barrier went up, but Adkins set sail
for the leaders, rating his horse along
with good judgment and finishing second.
The defeat of Stuyve is said to have
cost John W. Gates, John A. Drake and
other big bettors about $50,000. They
backed the horse from even money down
to 7 to 10.
Fifteen warrants for the arrest of per
sons connected with the Washington
Park Club were sworn out to-day by
Herman Coakley before Justice Bradwell.
The warrants charged the offenders with
keeping a common gaming-house. War
rants were eworn out also for the arrest
of three Pin^erton detectives who are al
leged to have interfered with constables
while in the discharge of their duties
yesterday.
Before Attorney Cantwell and his ret
inue of constables arrived at the race
track Constable Roebuck was arrested at
the entrance on orders from Inspector
Hunt of the police department. Roebuck
had attempted to enter the track and was
repulsed. He became unruly, according
to the police, and thereupon ensued a
lively struggle.
Later a squad of constables arrived at
the racetrack entrance and demanded ad
mittance. At first their efforts to enter
the grounds were prevented by detectives
under orders of the park officials, but
upon the arrival of Inspector Hunt- the
constables were permitted to enter after
they had promised to serve no warrants
until after the last race. There was no
disturbance and betting was not inter
fered with. The bookmakers arrested at
the close of the day gave bonds at once.
As a sequel to the events at Washing
ton Park, the gambling resort of James
O'Leary was raided by the police late
this afternoon and about fifty persons
were arrested. Summary:

NEW YORK. July ll.-Early visitors to

the day's profcTamme. He was one of
those down to ttart in the Islip Handicap,
haiidiea.rped at 117 pounds and required
to concede eight pounds to Golden Maxim,
of the same age. According to the scale
of weight for age, Africander was giving
15 pounds to Roehampton, IS pounds to
Com Paul and "6 pounds, exclusive of sex
allowance, to Sadie S, too much to con
cede for a stake worth no more than
Golden Maxim, the favorite, was sent
right along at the fall of the flag, and in
the riret furlong had a slight advantage,
which, he increased to five lengths in the
next half mile. It could hardly be called
a contest, so much of a load did the colt
Cain. and. while Rothampton and Oom
i'aul seemed to be closing on the leader
as they made the stretch turn, it was
merely on sufferance. Golden Maxim
again drew away in the stretch and won

These scores, brought America's grand
total up to 1570, beating last year's record
by eleven points.
Keough tied Sergeant Major Wallingford
of the Hythe Schoolof Musketry for the
best individual score, a total of 206.
The announcement of the American vic
tory was enthusiastically. cheered by the
large crowd of Americans present, and
the Americans were also congratulated
by the British and other competitors.
The scores at 1000 yards were
The totals for the second stage were
America, 515: Great Britain. 504; Canada,
434; Australia. 492; Natal, 447; Norway,
408; France, 404.
Interest in the later firing centered
chiefly in the Americans and the British.
The Canadians had been regarded as dark
horses, but their shooting did not justify
any hope of their success.
The shooting of the American team was
notably quicker than that of the others
and the Americans strictly followed the
instructions of their commanding officer
to refrain from the unnecessary conversa
tion in which some of the other teams in
dulged. The fact that the Americans had
gained a substantial load at the end of
the first two ranees elated them ryid
made them confident of their ability to
maintain the advantage in the last s'.age
and recover the trophy. ' %
Embassador Choate and Naval Attache
Stockton were among the spectators.
After the lunch interval the shooting of
the last stage commenced. During the
first twenty shots America added two to
her lead over the United Kingdom, and
added another three before the close:
In the second half of the 900 range the
Americans gained another two points,
making the aggregates at the end of the
second stage as follows:
America, 10G6; United Kingdom, 105$;
Canada. 1040; Australia. 1001; Natal, 960;
Norway," 355; France, S45.
The scores of the other Americans at
900 yards were:
- Short, 66; Cook, 63; Holcomb, 61; Wells,
59.
America. 266: United Kingdom, 257.
By the time half the teams had shot
off at 900 yards the Americans had gained
nine points, thus giving them a lead of
six points, after deducting the three they
were behind in the first stage.
To the total 266 Keough contributed 69;
Casey 68; Doyle 66 and Winder 63.
The Canadian first squad was second
with 262; the British team was third with
257.
The clearness of the atmosphere made
the shooting conditions ideal. There was
a variable breeze, which was blowing at
the average velocity of six miles an hour.
The scores of half the teams at 900 yards
were:
When the shooting in the second stage
commenced the Americans soon over
hauled and passed their British competi
tors. In the first N twonty shots the United
Kingdom dropped sixteen points, against
eight dropped by the Americans. As the
shooting progressed the keen Interest In
the contest was shown by the number of
spectators continually arriving.
' BISLEy, England, July 11.â America to
day captured' the Palma trophy. \ Her

board, which was good enough to put
him on second. Krug hit the" ball to the
pitcher, who- seemed to become dazed at
the honor and instead of throwlng.it to
third and forcing Lynch, he lined the
sphere to the first bag and Lynch made
third on the play. Then Delmas hit to
short, and while he was being retired.
Lynch landed with the third run for
Uncle. â¢ .
They made one more In the eighth just
for the fun of scoring a parting shot at
Mike. Irwln accepted a pass to first and
then proceeded to pilfer second. Graham
was in a hurry to intercept the rapid
course of the runner and he shied the ball
out Into the center garden, giving Irwin
a chance to get to third. He scored right
away on Leahy's out. shorty to first.
It was Fitzgerald'3 lucky^two-bagger
in 'the eighth that saved the Senators
from the white coating that seemed due.
The lad opened the inning with a fair
smash to deep center and went to third
on Doyle's wallop out to Lynch. While
Shay was busily engaged in retiring Mc-
Laughlin at first. Fitzgerald arrived with
the lone Senatorial tally.
There were several bits of flashy fielding
that tended to enliven the bleacherltes
and make those in the stands cry with
glee. In the fourth, with a man on first.
Truck Egan walloped out one that
soared away out against the left field
fence and looked good for three sacks,
but Lynch was right there and nabbed
the ball just as it was about to hit against
the fence.
Then again, in the seventh round, Del
mas saved a run by a pretty piece of fast
fielding. Townsend had just singled and
was tearing down the line to second when
Egan hit the leather squarely over the
second bag. No one ever dreamed that
Delmas would get it, but he did, and
forced Townsend at second with a per
fect throw to Shay, who was covering
the bag. The score:

WHEN the last man had sent
the sphere whirling safely into
the mits of the waiting fielder,
the hope that lingered within
the noble chest of M. Fisher
vanished as if by magic, for the game
was over and victory had paid another
visit to the camp of Uncle Hank, making
the fourth In a row for a week.* Score.
4 to 1.
'Twas a "gingery little exhibition with
the Senatorial gang on the short end of
the result even from the first inning.
Never during the progress of the set-to
did they make even a strong bid for the
battle, and the finish could plainly be
discerned through the clouds of several
rounds yet to come.
And the situation as it now stands is
beginning to assume a serious aspect for
Mike Fisher and a cheerful one for the
home magnate. San Francisco has been
steadily climbing up the pennant ladder,
till at present only one game separates
the local team from the, Senators for sec
ond place in the chase after the flag.
A fortnight ago the Senators were com
ing up strong and many of the wise fans
were willing to make a small-sized bet
that Mike Fisher and his followers would
nose ahead of Los Angeles for the leader
ship before they played many more
games. But they have met foes worthy
of their steel. since that time, and now It
is an even money bet that the Senators
will be in third, place by to-morrow night.
The home team played errorless ball
again yesterday i for the second day In
succession, and this, -with the swell pitch-
Ing of Eddie Herr,- left the Senators- but
a small chance to win. They were un
fortunate to bunch three errors, two of
which were costly and practically gave
the game to the home team.
Shay, the first man up for Uncle, suc
cessfully worked Fitzgerald for a base
on balls. Then Pat Meany shot a hot one
in the direction of Tommy Sheehan.
Tommy grabbed hold of the leather and
aimed at the first bag. But his wing was
not working to a nicety and away the
ball went out into right field, while Shay
tore around to the third cushion and
Meany rested safely at second.
Then the troubles of Fitzgerald com
menced. He took an aerial voyage for a
minute and forgot himself long enough to
hit Irwln a crack i in the ribs, which
filled the bags to overflowing.
Then the fans began to shout at Tommy
Leahy as he advanced to the rubber. But
Tommy wanted to please the crowd too
much and in his anxiety he produced a
pop fly which went into the mitts of Gra
ham. But Pabst fared better, sending
Shay home by forcing Irwin at second.
There were still two left to adorn the
sacks and Lynch let loose with a beauti
ful swat out in left field. Meany came
galloping over the ground and registered
the second run. but Pabst, who Is suffer
ing from a bad attack of "Chartey horse,"
was nailed at the plate while trying to
make the score 3 to 0.
The locals did not . wait long ere they
got busy again. In the fourth spasm
Lynch led off with a clout to the score

Regarding the blood stains, it Is thought
that Hausel may have received the knife
wound In the throat and walked to the
place where he met death, bleeding as he
went. The two men who followed are
thought to have been instrumental in giv
ing him the injury. It is admitted that
presence In the city recently.
MURI CLEARS HIMSELF.
Hausel was formerly an employe of the 1
Seattle Brewing and Malting Company ir/
Seattle. He married a niece of Mrs An
drew Hemrich. wife of the president of
that corporation, about a year and a half
ago, and moved to this city a few months
later."
Advices from San Jose are to the ef
fect that Hausel and Emil Muri. with whom
he had quarreled., -"worked in the malt
house of the Eagle brewery in that city
three years ago. One day they had a list
fight, in which Hausel came out second
best. As he was the aggressor, the man
ager discharged him. Muri was well
liked, while Hausel, on account of his
habits, was unpopular. >
is one of suicide, but are unable to ex
plain why a man with a knife wound in
his throat would visit a strange neighbor
hood and leap to death from a stairway
twelve feÂ«t high. There is only one little
piece of evidence that could assist in solv
ing the manner of the brewer's death. A
brass collar botton. badly crushed, was
found alongside of the body. This was
not the property of Hausel, as he wore a
soft flannel shirt. Which was fastened
by fixed buttons. Whether in a strug
gle this button was dropped by an assail
ant is "as yet unknown. The initials In
the hat that was found with the body also
arouse suspicion. They are "G. A," while
the dead man's were "J. H."
SCENES THAT FIGURE IN THE POLICE INVESTIGATION OF THE
DEATH OF JOSEPH HAUSEL. DETECTIVE WHO IS TRYING TO
SOLVE MYSTERY AND FORMER ENEMY OF DECEASED.
TKE mystery of the death of Joseph
HauFol if as far from a solution
as â¢when the body of the unfor
tunate brewer was discoverel on
!the sidewalk in front of 2j23 Gough
.rtreet Friday afternoon. The police pro
nounce the case one of suicide. They as
euroe that Hausel hurled himself from a
landing twelve feet high in front r.f the
house -where the body was found and that
-fatal injuries were- the result. There are,
however, circumstances which will net
conform to this theory. The presence of
the knife wound in the throat has n< t
been explaine-d and bloodstains, traced
many blocks from the scene of the caat'i,
give rise to the suspicion that murder
Â¦was done.
The supposed crime may be fixed upon
two men. both of whom are still unknown
to the police. They were seen following
liau&cl just before he was killed and jtr
terday it was ascertained that two stra^
Â«rs were se-en in a nearby saloon about
that time. A theory has been advanced
that the brewer rush*d up tne stalrway
to escape his pursuers, was followed, cap
tured and thrown from the top of the
ftairway. Ju*t what happened before this
time and what ltd up to the trouble, if
there wÂ«f any, forms the mysterious por
tion of th*Â» Ftory.
MENTALLY UNBALANCED.
One thing was proved by Detective
Ti'-alK's investigation. Hausel was ec
ceutTic and slightly demented. His re
utti from Vallejo was occasioned by the
fact that (he proprietor of the Solano
!BJWWfry believed him insane and dis
chkr^pd him. His leavetaking of his
wJTe in Los Angelc-s is also counted pc
rdlar. Up departed without h*Â»r knowl
e<lpe and- the only missive he ever penned
tq her was found unmailed in his trunk.
UJ3 associates nnd acquaintances talk of
tho .man's peculiar ideas. Those who
kse'w him bast say that he was demented.

The California Club courts were In
great demand yesterday afternoon and
some interesting matches were played
by the experts. Two very clever doubles
matches were played, the result in each
case being a tie. In the first Harry
Haight and Sidney Salisbury were Â¦ op
posed to Drs. Hill and Both
sets were close, the nrs\going to Haight
and Salisbury, 7-5, and the second to
the medical men, 6-4. The latter are im
proving rapidly and will make a for
midable doubles team. McChesney is
an old University of California cham
pion, and at present is playing a much
stronger game than in his college days.
In the next match Haight's place was
taken by Norman Hodgkinson, but even
with this reinforcement the doctors
were not beaten. They won the first set,
6-4, but lost the next, 7-5.
In singles A. W. Worthington again
distinguished himself by taking W. F.
Bull into camp. The latter lost four sets
out of five. Worthington is undoubtedly
the strongest of the lower class men.
and the latter find it a very difficult mat
ter to get even one set out of five from
him. The features of his game are his
well-placed serves and speedy drives.
Hill and Salisbury also played an ex
citing singles. They quit with honors
even, each winning a set. Hodgkinson
allowed odds of SO to Glenn Cogwlll, but
the latter won, 8-6.

Michael hasn't seen his German friends

Bing! A hot one to right . centerâ a
clever scoopâ a line throw to. first and
then "You're out!"
"Rotten! Rotten! Rotten!" from the
German" duo, and then chaos reigned. The
fat policeman was on top of them In an
instant and, with a pop-eyed German's
coat collar in either hand, he bumped
their heads /together until all became a
blank. Then he hauled them to \he exit
and booted them into the street. Mean
while the wretch who had caused all the
trouble was rolling in the sawdust,
screaming with devilish delight.
They saw and promised to obey.
A minute before the game started Fish
er was seen in close consultation with a
husky policeman. With extended fore
finger he pointed out his two friends.
"There," he explained to the officer, "are
a brace of Dutch loafers who came here
to break this game up in a riot." I heard
'cm talking: about it. There are others
scattered about in the audience, but
they're the ringleaders and they intend
to start the trouble by yelling 'Rotten.' "
"Holy Moses!" interrupted the law's
guardian. "Say no more, Mr. Fisher.
I'll fix 'em the minute they start in to
roar. Leave it to me. I hate the Dutch,
anyhow."
"Batter up!" called the mask and chest
protector man and a sprightly athlete of
the Fisher combine stood at the plate,
bat in hand.
Those who have been told the story are
laughing over the discomfiture of two
German grocerymen who, until a few days
ago, boasted of the intimate friendship
which existed between themselves and
Mike Fisher, baseball manager, practical
joker and so forth. The boast has been
called in and they are now out after Mike
with bung starters and things. Here's
how it happened:
Mr. Fisher's Teutonic friends had never
witnessed a baseball game. After per
sistent persuasion Mike prevailed upon
them the other day to accompany him to
the Harrison street lot to see his Senators
wipe the earth with a rival bunch of
ball tossers. Fl/lding seats for them down
in front of a big audience of the grand
stand cranks, the suave Michael gave
them a parting word of instruction prior
to hurrying away to attend to his man
agerial duties.
"Now listen to me," said the brazen
hypocrite, "what you want to do is this:
You see that big fellow out there with
the mask and chest protector on? Well,
he's the guy we call the umpire. Now,
you watch him; for. Just as likely aa not,
as soon as one of my men hits the ball
and starts to run that fellow will holler
'You're out.' If he does so I want both
of you to stand right up in your seats and
yell 'RoUen.' Keep yelling 'Rotten' as
loud as you can, for that'll help me to
win the game, see?"

Chemists have long ago told us not only,
what is the exact composition of the air,
but also that this composition is prac
tically constant, whether the air be that
near the mountain top or the sea, or from
the country or of the town. So far, then,
chemistry would not appear to offer any
explanation of the benefit gained from a
"change of . air." Similarly, every one
knows the sweetness and freshness of the
early morning air, attractive properties
which disappear as the day advances; but
eo for as analysis goes the composition
of'Arly morning air is not different from
that of air at any other time. â¢
It will bo . remembered, however, that
during the passing of night to day and of
day to night several physical changes
take place. There is a fall in temperature
at sunset and a rise again at dawn, and
consequently moisture is alternately being
thrown out and taken up again, and it is
well known -that change of state Is ac
companied, by electrical phenomena and
certain chemical manifestations also. The
formation of dew has probably, therefore,
far. more of dew effects that merely the
moistening of objects -with water. Dew

King to his friends in the priesthood
Father Michael King, pastor of

half a century in the service of the Lord.
With his parishioners, the, beloved priest

In 1SG5 Father King was asigned to the
parish of the Immaculate Conception on
this side of the bay to succeed Rev. Fath
er John Qulnn, who passed away a short
time previously. Father King's clerical
field then extended from San Pablo, in
Contra Costa County, to Mission San
Jose, in the eastern end of Alameda
County. When Father King arrived here
in 1865 he found an humble frame build
ing for a church and dwelling in course
of construction. It stood on the north
side of Seventh street, between Jefferson
and Grove, and was used for religious
worship until the present church of the
Immaculate Conception was built some
years later. The parish now Is among
the largest In Oakland. It was Father
King who established the Sacred Heart
Convent on the shores of Lake Merritt
In 186S, the Sisters being brought here from
Montreal. The Sacred Heart Convent
now has a staff of seventy-five Sisters and
ranks with the first of educational insti

After ten years of zealous work among
the early settlers and soldiers then In Ore

priest endeared himself to believers and
unbelievers by his self-sacrifice and de

others, Father King was recalled to San
Francisco and appointed an assistant at
the old St. Patrick's Church, then located
where the Palace Hotel now stands.
Is vitalizing, not entirely because it is
water, but because it possesses an Invig
orating action due partly, at any rate, to
the fact that It is saturated with oxygen
and It has been stated that during its
formation peroxide of hydrogen and some
ozone are developed.
It is not improbable that the peculiarly
attractive and refreshing quality which
marks the early morning air has its origin
in this. way. Certain, it is that the brac
ing property of the early morning air
wears off as the day advances and it is
easy to conceive that this loos of fresh
ness is due to the oxygen,' ozone or per
oxide of hydrogen (whichever it may be)
being used up. The difficulty of inducing
grass to flourish under a tree In full leaf
Is well known, and it is generally explain
ed by saying that the tree absorbs tho
nourishing constituents of the soil or that
it keeps the sunlight away from the_grass
and protects It' from rain. It is doubtful
whether any of these explanatlpns are
true, the real reason most probably being
that the vitalizing dew cannot form upon
the grass under a tree, whereas as a rule
both rain and light can reach it. Dew is
probably essential to the well being of
both plant and animal to a greater extent
than is known and the beautiful expres
sion in the prayer book, "Pour upon them
the continued dew of thy blessing," may
be' remembered in this connection.âLon

them to their lair, where, the detective
alleges, cruel acts have been performed. Â»

pang of juvenile robbers, were taken into
custody to-day by the police, but their

Three large canopic vases of alabaster
are especially fine. They are crowned by
carved llda representing human heads and
were used by the Egyptians to contain
the viscera from bodies that were to be
embalmed. These were put In the tombs
with the mumtnv. There are also'sev
eral mummy masks painted and decor
ated In brilliant designs, with colors that
all the ages since have scarcely dimmed.
One entire case is filled with statuettes
and small human figures, some made of
red unburnlshed terra cotta, others of
hard enameled porcelain, colored in light
green pale blue, yellow and brown and
bearing hieroglyphics. They are funeral
figures and were buried with the dead.
The Inscriptions upon them correspond to
the modern tombstone inscriptions. One
of them reads, "In the name of Psametlc,
born by Amenixites," Psametlc being the
name of a king of the twenty-sixth dy
nasty.
There Is a necklace In the collection
taken from the mummy of a daughter
of the great Pharoah. One of the rarest
specimens is a clay stele, or writing tab
let covered with hieroglyphics which rep
resent King Amosis of the twenty-sixth
dynasty making an offering to a god.
All the articles of the collection were;
gathered by Emll Brugsch Bey from
among the tombs and sarcophagi of the
old Egyptian kings, unearthed among the
ruins of Memphis. Thebes, and Saggarat.
These places are thÂ» principal sources of
all the Egyptian archaeological antiqui
ties yet discovered.
" Doubtless the most historically impor
tant, piece in the entire collection Is a
small, rude clay model of a dwelling such
as was built durinsr the twelfth dynasty,
about 3000 B. C. It shows a cubical, two
storied house with exterior stone steps
leading to an upper chamber In which
a human figure reclines upon a mat. In
front of the building is a courtyard with
high walls of terra cotta and a fountain
In the center.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. July 11.â
Of the collections recently added to the
Iceland Stanford Junior Museum the most
Interesting and valuable Is a group of
Egyptian antiques that has Just been in
stalled in one of the newly erected wings |
of the building. The antiques arrived
from Egypt last week, but were shown
to the public for the first time to-day.
Many people visited the museum to view
the curious relics of a lost civilization.
The specimens formed the most Impor
tant part of the private collections of
Emil Brugsch Bey. the noted Egyptian
archaeologist, who has lately retired
from the curatorship of the famous Glzeh
Museum and is disposing of his many
collections, after a lifetime spent in
searching for them among the buried cit
ies of the Nile. Mrs. Stanford procured
the present consignment from among nu
merous bidders through a strong friend
ship which existed between the venerable
M. Bey' and young Leland Stanford while
the latter was gathering curios abroad.
The collection consists of about 330
pieces, arranged in six large cases, and
Includes some of the most remarkable
archaeological remains ever _ taken from
the Egyptian field. There are specimens
of the handicraft of men who lived 6000
years agoâ handicraft that shows by its
finish and delicacy of workmanship that
even in that remote period civilization
had long ceased to be young. There are
stone images of men and gods, some won
derfully wrought in detail. There are
toys with which the little brown skinned
Egyptians amused themselves 3000 years
before Christ, miniature wooden boats,
carved, painted and manned by sailor
figures, Just as the little ship that de
lights the twentieth century lad.
There are Implements and articles of
the toilet from which some of x>ur mod
ern vain conceits might easily be traced,
small stone mortars, for Instance, in
which pigments were prepared for black
ening the eyebrows and heightening the
complexion; metal mirrors in which
young Egyptian girls gazed upon their
own beauty, beads of carmelian and the
precious lapus lazuli, silver bracelets of
the most delicate structure, wonderful
rings of soft, pliant gold that almost
crush in the hand.
Then there are many household uten
sils and warlike weapons, amulets,
shrines, vases, bowls, etc., made of baked
earth: enameled porcelain, alabaster,
marble, stone, silver and bronze, all mak
ing up an array that is like a momen
tary kaleidoscopic n'inipse back through
Roman culture and Greek art to the very
threshold of civilization, where that cul
ture and art was taking first shape; back
to the time when great cities stretched
along the Nile, when the ancient Egypt-
Ian empire had Just begun, and Menes,
the first king, yet lived fresh in the mem
ory of hl3 people.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Renton was on the oldest employes of
the company on this side of the bay. He
denies that he said anything to Flemming
or his son.
The first arrest growing out of the
strike of the linemen of the Pacific States
Telephone Company occurred ' 'â¢" this
afternoon, when Robert Flemming, su
perintendent of the company in this city,
arrested H. D. henton and turned him
over to Policeman Gardner on a charge
of using vulgar language. Renton was
at once released on JÂ£5 ball.
The sidewalk in front of the telephone
building on Twelfth kreet was filled with
striking linemen, who were using every
f-ffort to get the non-union linemen who
"were at work to desert the company.
When one of the non-union men would
come from the shop in the basement of
fhe building to the repair wagons at the
rurb the union men would argue with
him and try to induce him to quit his
work. The two policemen who are sta
tioned at the telephone company's office
every day did not attempt to stop this, so
long as it was carried on in an orderly
manner, but the officials of the company
resented this interference with their men.
There was a special effort made this
afternoon to get a man by the name of
Ester to leave the employ of the com
pany, and in the midst of the argument
between Ester and the union men Super
intendent Flemming arrived. He told Es
ter to go into the repair shop, which he
did, and then suddenly reaching Into the
crowd he grasped Renton and turned him
over to Policeman Gardner. For a mo
ment the crowd thought that it was for
something that Renton had done at that
moment, but Flemming explained that it
wp.s because Renton about an hour before
had shouted some insulting words
through the window at his son and him
eelf.

In the holder. "It's terrible," he nald.
"how ink corrodes pens. In six or seven
hours a new p^n will begin to scratch. It
keeps me busy changing them. There's
money In it for the man who will Invent
a non-corrosive ink." An old manâ a bill
collectorâ remarked to him: "My young
friend, take a few rusty Iron nails and
put them in your Ink welL The Ink's
corrosive acid will play Itself out on the
nails,, and in consequence your pen will
escape. A pen that only lasts you a day

Spanish Politeness.
Bokayeff is the bridegroom's name and
Neshkho that of the girl of sweet sixteen
who had the misfortune to find favor in
his eyes. His pockets being empty, he
persuaded three comrades to kidnap the
maid, whom he then took off to another
village as his wife. But her father, on
discovering her whereabouts, had her sent
back by the police, and then demanded
Â£30 for the loss of her services, as we
should say. Bokayeff, to whom the de
mand was made, would not or could not
pay. The girl's father thereupon claimed
that sum from the bridegroom's com
panions, who are equally liable. They ad
mitted the justice of his claim and called
upon Bokayeff- to hand over the sum to
them. On his refusal they shot him dead,
that being the custom of the country, al
though daggers are also allowed to take
the place of bullets. The three youths
were forthwith arrested and will, of
course t be tried and deported in due
courije^But that, far from being the end
of'the matter, is only the very beginning.
The kindred of the slain man are now
preparing to "wipe out" the relatives of
the murderers, while the family of the
dishonored girl is bound by the custom of
the country to wash away the stain on
her reputation in the blood of the clans
of both the murdered man and his mur
derers. And Russian law Is powerless to
Intervene.â London Dally Telegraph.
In the Northern Caucasus nearly half
the death rate of the inhabitants is
caused by vendetta, and at least three
fourths of the vendetta cases are the re
sult of a curious marriage custom which
is now decimating the population. The
native of those parts who wishes to take
unto himself a wife cannot arrange the
matter in the Elmple offhand manner in
vogue in western Europe by "popping the
question." He must go home, sell his be
longings, and buy .her fairly and squarely
of her parents, the price ranging from
Â£35 to Â£200. This Is a costly custom in
many ways* for It Is not every young
man who can afford to Invest such a
large sum in a wife, however accom
plished. What generally happens in such
cases is that the. indigent candidate for
the order of Benedick induces a few stal
wart comrades to seize the maiden and
carry her off. "What too often follows
then may be gathered from a case in
point which has just taken place In Sos
slambek.

â¢ Wireless telegraphy could not spread the good
news that Strauss & Frohmann's annual sale
Is here again any quicker than It is going 'to

Is what makes Strauss & Frohmann's annual
remnant eale so popular; the ladles tell each

And the cause ie not hard to find. Strauea

"Wireless Telegraphy.
The director of the Sheffield Scientific
School, Professor Russell H. Chittenden,
throws a little new light on. an old ques
tion in the Popular Science Monthly for
June. He mentions a discrepancy which
he has observed between fact and theory
regarding the amount of food a man
should take. Volt of Munich and Atwa
ter of Middletown. Conn., for instance,
have set up certain standards, which are
fairly close together. A person doing
"moderate work," say these experts,
should take from US to 125 grams of pro
telds and enough fats and sugars to raise
the total fuel value of his rations to be
tween 3000 and 3500 "large calories." For
"heavy work" they recommend a diet
yielding from 3370 to 4500 calories daily.
Careful experiments with a laboratory as
sistant at Yale showed that forty-five
grams of proteids, with'fat and sugars
sufficient to develop only 1600 calories,
would keep him In splendid condition. He
maintained his weight perfectly, and met
physical tests in the Yale gymnasium in a
surprising fashion. The comparison sug
gests the possibility that the, food allow
ances of Volt and Atwater are wasteful
in a pecuniary sense, and hamper the
system* by involving unnecessary work In
digestion and elimination.
Probably no fact in everyday life is bet
ter established than that the majority of
people eat too much. Medical men are
continually declaring that far more harm
comes from dietary excesses and careless
ness than from starvation. A large va
riety and amount of sickness result from
that cause. Moreover, even when he Is in
apparent health, a man's activity is ofien
sensibly Impaired for two or three hours
by a hearty meal. Professional men in
particular are thus affected. Efficiency is
influenced by other factors. Exercise,
ventilation and sleep, or the lack of them,
tell on one's capacity. Nutrition depsnds
on the way in which one eats as well as
on what he eats. Again, taste or some
social obligation, rather than a recognized
need of nourishment, will often dictate
the character of even an ordinarily ab
stemious man's repast. If he wants to get!
the largest amount of work and the besc
quality of work out of himself, however,
he is almost sure to cultivate 'moderation
at the table, at least until tho conclusion
of his day's labor.
Whether the example cited by Profes
sor Chittenden should be accepted as a
standard is another question. Possibly
the requirements of that individual are
exceptionally small. No one man's ex
perience can be safely taken as a rule for
others. Two persons of the same weight
and performing precisely the same duties
and eating their food with equal delibera
tion may differ sufficiently In other ways
to demand dissimilarity In the amounts
they consume. One may have a good di
gestion and the other a poor one. If, on
the other hand, there is a difference In
the character, amount and ( hours of their
work, a still greater disparity In their
needs might be expected. Professor Chit
tenden does not himself consider the ques
tion settled. He wants it to be studied
further. It is to be wished that a series
of tests might be devised in which the
conditions would be altered so as to rep
resent a variety of types. Occupation,
sex, age, general health, leisure hour
pursuits and other circumstances ought .to
be taken into account. A sliding scale
would probably be the outcome of the
research. Instructive as such a result
would be, it might be necessary, even
then, for some people to act a little inde
pendently. It would hardly be correct to
say that every one is capable of working
this problem out for himself; but, since
no two persons are exactly alike, it would
occasionally be judicious to rely largely
on observation of one's own needs.â New

To make any campaign entirely effec
tive, all breeding places must be dealt
with; and for this purpose there Is no
more effective destructive agency than
kerosene oil of a low grade. Though the
mosquito larva is strictly aquatic, it de
pends upon getting its air supply from
above the surface through a short tube
at It* anal extremity. If the surface Is
coated with kerosene, access to the air
Is barred, exceot at the cost of a dose
of oil, and there Is for the unfortunate
wriggler only a choice of deaths; It
either stifles for lack of air or It is poi
soned bv the kerosene which gets into
Its breathing system. The method is a
good one, and absolutely effective; but
the oil Is offensive, and the applications
must be repeated at short Intervals. A
better method, therefore, is to destroy the
breeding places altogether, so as to get
a permanent result. A little grading and
filling here and there, to get rid of de
pressions that fill vwth the rains, a ditch
or two to drain a low plaee, and local
exemption may often be gained. Water
barrels and imperfectly closed cisterns
majy be kept quite safe by placing in
them a few little fish of almost any spe
cies; gold fish will do. or the little min
nows that may be found in almost every
stream or pond throughout the country.
âHarper's Weekly.
In the Eastern United State3 there is
only one speciesâ the salt marsh mos
quitoâof which it is positively known
that It travels great distances. Any
point between twenty and forty miles
from a marshy coast is liable to inva
sion by this species, though at the lat
ter distance their occurrence is only oc
casional and their stay usually short. In
the highlands at point3 away from the
coast, and even In cities, towns and vil
lages near the shore, the presence of any
considerable number of mosquitoes con
tinuing steadily through the season indi
cates the existence of some local breed
ing place; and such breeding places may
occur even In our very houses.
A forgotten bucket of water in the
cellar or Just outside will serve to de
velop hundreds; a rain barrel Is good for
thousands per week unless securely cov
ered, and any vessel, even a tin can, m
which water remains continuously for
more than a week may serve as a source
of supply. It must be realized that no
pool Is too insignificant to be utilized by
a female mosquito who has a batch of
eggs to be olaced.
TO FIGHT THE PEST.
We have thus narrowed the problem
materially, and ran say that. In general,
mosquitoes either breed close to the
places where they occur In numbers, or
that they corr.e in like a thief in the night
from shore points.
THE SAXTMARSH MOSQUITO.
We may *ay with certainty that no
mosquito thus -far known can devolop
without water enough' to breed In: but
we cannot eay that In all waters mosqui
toes will thrive. In fact, we are now
learning that there are many swamp
areas, once supposed to be prolific pro
ducers of the insects, in which practically
none at all develops. We have also
learned that the ugly looking pools and
ponds covered with green duckweed are
always "safe," because no larva can ex
ist where it cannot freely come to the
surface; and we know that the great
area? covered by "cat-tails" are also
harmless from the mosquito standpoint,
though the reasons for this are not yet
clear.
There is a difference in mosquitoes, as
there is in men, concerning the places in
which they like best to live. A feware
really domestic, in the sense that they live
by preference with man and about his
habitations; but many are strictly sylvan
and do not molest him unless he runs de
liberately Into their way. A very few
have never been known to bite under any
provocation, while others need no urging
whatever and appear to be literally blood
thirsty. Most of them are home bodies,
straying little or not at all from the im
mefllate surroundings of the point where
they first reached the adult stage, while
others travel many miles and supply re
gions where none are native. This argues
quite a variety of mosquitoes, and, as a
matter of fact, it is a poor locality that
cannot turn out twenty or more species
of the pest. It is the failure to realize
this pointâ the tendency to consider that
all mosquitoes are alike and equally pes
tiferous â that is responsible for unsatis
factory results among mosquito crusades.
What benefit can be expected from
local work when the dominant mosquito
breeds twenty or more miles away, and
what good does It do to oil ponds and
streams unless we know that mosquitoes
breed in them?

Property and Franchises Greatly Increased Since
Vl 1898 and the Worth of the Banks in the City
More Than Doubles During the Same Period
THE assessment roll recently presented by Assessor Dodgre to the Board
o'f Supervisors discloses some Interesting figures as to the value of per
sonal property, real estate and franchises upon which quasi-public cor
porations and banks must pay taxes,
As compared with the assessments for 185S the figures for 1903 show
a marked Increase. In the followlne table showlne the assessment of quasl
public corporations the figures include the estimated value of franchises. The
value of" the franchises- is estimated according to the market value of the stock
of the corporation. The decrease of the assessment of the San Francisco Gas
and Klectric Compuny is due to the decline of the value of the corporation's
franchise, based on falling stock, caused by the competition of other companies
and decreased earnings. The franchise of this company was reduced in esti
mated value from $2,065,442 in 1898 to 1250,000 in 1903.
The total assessment of the quasi-public corporations is as follows:

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Two-thirds of the inmates of our hospitals are women. They are in most cases either for treatnteni
or for an operation, made necessary by advanced stages of female troubles which have resulted in OYaritu,
a tumor, or displacement of the womb.
"AN OPERATION NECESSARY."
How these words after the examination strike terror to a woman's soul, and with what regrets s"h8
hears them, when she considers that the operation has become necessary through her own neglect. Female
derangements cannot cure themselves, and neglecting the warnings of nature only means putting it off until
therMs no cure. The woman who lets her trouble make headway pays the penalty of a dangerous opera-
tion/and a lifetime of impaired usefulness at the best, and the operation often proves fatal when her lifo
might have been saved by jLydla E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
When women are troubled with irregular, suppressed or- painful menstru-
ation, weakness, leucorrhosa, displacement or ulceration of the womb, that
bearing down feeling, inflammation of the ovaries, backache, bloating (or flatu-
lence), general debility, indigestion and nervous prostration ; or are beset with
such symptoms as dizziness, faintness, lassitude, excitability, irritability, ner-
vousness, sleeplessness, melancholy, and " want-to-be-left-alone " feelings, and
the blues, they should remember that there is one tried and never-failing
remedy; Lydia E. Pinkham's Compound at once removes such troubles.
READ THE FOLLOWING LETTERS.
â¢Dear Mrs. PnnraAM: â I cannot tell you how much good you have done me and how thankful I
am to you for it. For five years I have not been free from pain for a day. I have had backaches, headaches,
and those awful dragging sensations with leucorrhcea, and when menstruation appeared I was in such a
condition I could hardly sit up. I doctored all the time, but nothing helped me, and I was told that an
operation was necessary. \
" Two months ago a friend suggested that I try Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound. No
one knows what it has done for me and how thankful I am for k. It brought me the first well days I have
had for five years. It did for me what doctors could not do, Ind I want every suffering woman to know
about it." â Louisa Natheb, 751 E. 166th St., New York/City. Â£ '
"Dbab Mrs. Pinkham: â I wish to thank you for what Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
has done for me. I had terrible hemorrhages, being lacerated from the birth of my child. The doctor told
me that if I would have an operation I would be well and strong. I submitted to it, but was worse than
before : no one knows what I suffered. Finally a friend advised me to try your Vegetable Compound; I did
so, and commenced to feel better * x I continued its use, and it has done for me what doctors could not do. I
am strong and well If women with any kind of female troubles would only consult you before submitting
to an operation they would be spared many hours of pain and suffering. 1 cannot thank you enough for
what you have done for me."â Anna Ktrchhoit, 150 E. 100th St., New York City.

Dr. Willey, for the Government, has I
been conducting for some time a food j
test, six young men being the subjects.
In the four weeks they have been tak- !
ing it their freckles, moth patches and '
pimples have disappeared, and their '
cheeks have become a pretty pink. This â¢
hint to the women need not be pointed
out. They would find such a hint buried
under a ton of statistics.

ATLANTA. Ga.. July 11.â The forenoon
session of the International/ convention
of the Baptist Young People's Union was
largely taken up by the Interesting exer
cises of the salutation of the flags, con
ducted by Rev. Dr. Walter Cafley of Chi
cago. This ceremony consisted of a large
procession of banners, borne by young
ladies, representing all sections of the
country. Following this was a call of
the roll, with responses by delegates from
the various States. Territories and
provinces, detailing the progress of the
work in their districts. The afternoon
session was devoted to the Junior branch
of the society, the exercises being upon
the general subject. "The Light of the
World."

Sunrise quiet hour services In five city
churches at 6 o'clock this morning were
attended by thousands of delegates, al
though they had been occupied until late
last night with convention business. From
8:30 to 9;30 sessions of the Christian En
deavor School of Methods were held In
eight churches.
At 10 o'clock a conference of State, dis
trict and local union officers began at
Central Presbyterian Church, President
Clark presiding. Well considered ad
dresses, containing many valuable sugges
tions to Christian Endeavor workers,
were delivered by Henry H. Marcrusson
of Chicago; H. N. Lathrop. Boston; John
A:; Rockwood, Portland. Or.; Fred W.
Chamberlain, Detroit: Rev. C. H. Hub
bell, Columbus, O.; Rev. Joseph S. Ro
dey, Harrisburg, Pa.;' John R. Clements.
In taking the initiative in the advocacy
of such union the Christian Endeavor So
ciety points to Its priority of establish
ment as justification.
"To 1 Evangelize the World," this is the
keynote of the pleas of the noted minis
terial orators of this country and of Eng
land, who, 4 by their zeal and eloquence,
are stirring the souls of the large audi
ences which attend the sessions of the
International Christian Endeavor conven
tion and the numerous auxiliary meet
ings. That a definite plan for carrying on
the work will be adopted before the con
vention adjourns Is probable.'
Complete registered returns of accred
ited delegates have not yet been compiled,
but at the lowst estimate there are now
fully $000 in the city, and the total number
of visitors Is not less than 20,000.
Two pleasant Impromptu features of the
convention have been the presentation by
Chaplain Robert E. Steel of the United
States navy to President Francis E. Clark
of a small American flag, said to be the
first raised by American troops over
Cavite, and the expression, given by Rev.
R. J. Campbell of London, to the senti
ment of unity- growing between Great
Britain and the United States.
DENVER, July 11.â A movement of sig
nal Importance in the rellgiou3 world
has been launched by the Christian En
deavor convention, now in session here.
It Is a tentative proposal to work for the
amalgamation of the Christian Endeavor
Society, the Epworth League and the
Baptist Union, and It will be presented in
the form of a petition from the Endeav
orers to the other two national bodies.

Both suffered ugly lacerations as a re
sult of their encounter with the animal.
They immediately summoned a physician
and had their wounds cauterized. The
accident is likely to put the champion
back several days in his training.
The bear was captured by the proprie
tor of the springs and Fitzsimmons built
him a house. When he tried to induce
the animal to enter the place he refused
and would not budge., Fitz then called
upon Jeffries to aid him in the task, but
the combined strength of the two boxers
failed to budge the beast.
While they were busily engaged in try
ing to induce the bear to enter his new
quarters Fitzsimmons' pet fox terrier,
thinking that hia master was in trouble,
went .to the rescue. The dog bit the bear
on the nosa and this aroused the ani
mal's ire and he Immediately attacked
the canine, chewing it up badly.
The two pugilists tnen went to the res
cue of the pet and .finally succeeded In
tearing him from the grasp of the angry
bear. No sooner was the dog set loose
than the bear turne'd on the men and
succeeded in biting botn of them ere they
could make their escape.
Word has been received In this city of
an encounter which Champion Jim Jeff
ries and his trainer,' ex-champion Bob
Fitzsimmons, had with a big bear at
Harbin Springs. The two noted pugilists
were both badly bitten by the vicious
animal, Fitz In the leg and Jeff In the
arm and lee.

The vacation season ls^now at its height
and the great number of absentees from
San Francisco has taken the edge tem
porarily off all lines of business. The ef
fect of absenteeism Is felt among the
realty brokers, but the outlook for the
immediate future is bo good that no one
grumbles. During the last Week approxi
mately 200 transfers of real property in
this city were placed on record, -which
makes up a fine showing. These records
represent transactions that took place a
little earlier In most cases. Some sales
cf importance are announced that have
just been made.
Concerning the general trend of realty
in San Francisco, as manifested by ac
tual transactions, G. H. Umbsen & Co. In
their Real Estate Records say:
"For some time the 100-vara quarter has
been neglected; after having marked the
revival In local real estate, but as other
districts have been worked over by in
vestors, attention is being brought once
more to the point of departure, and by
the means of street improvements south
of Market street it is sought to invite in
vestment and further improvement there.
The flfty-vara section has much better
reflected the general trend of the mar
ket during the last six months, while
much on a parity with It has been the
Western Addition, which latter, however,
has developed a tendency to take the first
rank as the spring has passed and the
summer has commenced. The Mission
district has increased In public favor,
showing more and more activity as the
Beason has progressed, a notable evidence
of strength, and promises still better
things when the autumn sets in. Most
striking, however, has been the record of
the outside lands district, both to the
north and south of the park. Ocean beach
purchases have been very numerous and
the prices of real estate commanding a
view of the Pacific have wonderfully ad
vanced. There Is a decided movement
also north of the public pleasure resort,
particularly in the Pacific Heights dis
trict, which Is spreading rapidly as an in
habited quarter of this city. Richmond
proper has been hampered in its growth
for peveral years by the lack of proper
opening to the beach, as Is the case to the
south of Golden Gate Park, but a move
ment, has been Inaugurated which gives
the best promise of success, Involving the
extension of D or Fulton street to the
ocean and the making of other improve
ments which will make residence in Rich
mond very desirable. The number of
pieces of outside lands rfalty placed on
record each month has been about the
same, but there has been a notable in
crease in the total of the considerations
therefor, showing a general advance In
values In the outlying sections of the city.
The terms "outside" and "outlying" are
only justified by usage, for with the
streetcar, service and the growth of the
population such designations have be
come only comparative."

Chicago Grain Market.
CHICAGO, July 11.â Cables and weather
conditions were rather disappointing to the
bulls at the start and there was much wheat
fi.r sale by local traders at the opening to
day, which resulted In an easier feeling. Open-
Ing sales of September were %c to %c lower at
7S%c to 78%c. but the price quickly raillled to
79%Â®79Uc on an active commission-house de
mand. Although the crop reDOrt was con
sidered somewhat bullish, lt showed more fa
vorable Drospects than had been anticipated
by many traders, but reports from the South
west were still disappointing in the amount
of the yield, arid this fact contributed mainly
to the strength. The advance at St. Lculs was
also a bull factor. Temporary declines were
experienced at various stages of the trade, but
each decline was met by additional buying
orders, and the market was not slow In
responding to the demand. Trading was ac
tive the latter Dart of the session and the
close was strong, with September %c higher
at 79%c. >
The Government report had a depressing In
fluence on the corn market to-day, September
closing %@%c lower at 61%c.
OatH ruled easier on a rather bearish Gov
ernment crop report and in sympathy with
corn. September closed %@Vic lower at 34%c.
Provisions were firm early, but ! selling . of
pork and ribs later In the session caused a re
action. September pork closed 20c lower, Sep
tember lard was a shade lower and September
ribs were off 2%e.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

OATS â Offerings continued light and the
market was steady. The Go\-ernment opened
bids for the first lot of 2000 tons on the ocder
several times mentioned of late. The Chicago
letter of Bolton. De Ruyter & Co. said: "Thia
market maintains Its previous steady tone. The
Government report Indicates a crop of about
725,000,000 bushels. This was about as ex
pected. Weather conditions are on the whole
very favorable for the crop and the movement !
of new oats is not far off. In the meantime
the cash demand is poor and prices in" this
market aro sustained by manipulation for the j
July option. Unless something new comes Into
the conditions we -are inclined to thlnk^oats
are high enough."

The Government report indicates . a crop of

large as the trade had expected. The weather
throughout the entire corn belt since the 1st
inst. has been most favorable and the crop has
made rapid progress. It Is of course still back
ward, and continued favorable weather Is ab
solutely necessary. This . market Is almost
wholly a speculative one at the moment. The
cash position la poor, with liberal receipts, fair
Ktocks and a poor demand. We do not look for
higher prices." _ .:',Â«!'..

WHEAT â The foreign markets were not ma
terially changed. Chicago was higher. A wire
from Minneapolis said: "Total failure In some
districts, two-thirds of a crop in others and
a short crop in all parts of the Northwest is
the burden of a Northern Pacific crop report
issued Friday."
This market was unchanged, with easier
futures. The Chicago letter of Bolton, De Ruy
ter &, Co. said: "The market Is again active
and strong. The Government crop report In
dicates a crop of about 670,000,000, or 50,000,000
less than the June report. We are Inclined to
think that the thrashing returns which have
developed since the 1st inst. and since the re
port was made. Justify a still further shrink
age In the estimate. The Northwest crop is at
the moment having desirable weather, but" is
still in danger. Stocks of wheat aro practi
cally exhausted and there is every Indication
that movement of winter wheat will, as com
pared with last year and the year before, be
light. The crop Is of good quality, wheat Is
the cheapest thing on the farm and the farmers
are In good financial condition. We look for
ultimately much higher prices Â«nd think wheat
should bo bought on the breaks."

Most descriptions under this head were in
free supply, but the market was rather steady,
as retailers were buying freely for Sunday re
quirements and there was a fair inquiry for
shipment on the Portland steamer, out to-day.
RecelptB of Apricots from the river continued
light, but there were liberal receipts from
Sonoma County and liberal purchases by can
ners that kept the market steady Fresh arriv
als of Peaches from the river sections were
also light, but there was too much carried-over
stock on hand to permit any advance In prices.
A few lots of fancy In baskets and boxes com
manded a small premium over the maximum
quotation. Apples were steady, trashy stock
being well cleaned up. Well colored Graven
steins packed in 4-tier boxes sold readily at
$1 50 per box. Bartlett Pears of good quality
and size were in demand at the quoted figures.
Windfalls were offered freely on the wharf
below the quoted rates, but found few buyers.
Plums. Prunes, Figs and Cherries stood about
as previously quoted, supplies being more than
sufficient for requirements. There were no
fresh receipts of Grapes from Yuma, but car
ried-over stock was offering freely and
dragged at easier rates. The cool weather
operated against the sale of Melons and prices
ranged lower. A car of Watermelons arrived
from Fresno, the first of the season from
that quarter, but was not marketed. Changes
in Berries were slight. The j best offerings
were In fair request, but poor and soft stock
dragged and was cleaned up to peddlers and
canners at easy figures. The best grades of
Oranges and. Lemons moved freely, but the
cheaper grades were dull. Limes and Bananas
were easy and unchanged.
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Silver continues to creep up slowly. Ex
change is still weak, with the banks shading

Receipts of new Potatoes were liberal and.
as there waa no inquiry for shipping, the mar
ket had an easier tone. Prices of fancy stock
were fairly well sustained under a good local
demand, but cheap stock drar^ed and there was
Quite a surplus unsold ut the close. One lot
of strictly fancy in sacks sold at auction for
$1 70 per cental and occasional lots in boxes
sold at a premium. Old Burbanks were firmly
held at the recently reduced prices, but trading
was generally light. Onions arrived freely and
prices were unchanged.
Trading in vegetables was brisk as usual
on Saturday and desirable stock moved freely
in the early morning at good prices. Green
Corn in crates was generally poor and wormy
and sold at lower rates. Choice stock in sacks
cleaned up quickly at higher figures. Prices
of Tomatoes and Cucumbers in small packages
ranged lower, but large open boxes continued
to bring good prices. Egg Plant was selling
by the box at a decline and Green Peppers were
in free supply and lower. Asparagus, Peas and
String Beans were steady for good stock, while

St. Paul Leaves for North
Captain Xclsnn of the Annie John/an
takes an opposite view of the case.^ He
declares that cm the outward passage the
real traveling qualities of his vessel were
given a fair show and that coming home
was no race at all.
"I will admit." he said yesterday, "that
the Irmgard can drift faster than ray
boat. The Annie was built for sailing."
On the outward passage, when the An
nie Johnson made what Captain Nelson
believes to be the record trip, there were
two days on each of which she logged 3G0
knots and there was no day on which she
dia not travel more than 260 knots. On
th<Â» homeward run all the traveling, he
says, was done during the last seven days
of the voyage and that there were some
days shortly after leaving Honolulu when
the distance made was too insignificant to
note on tho chart."
THE bark Annie Johnson, which
left Honolulu In company with the
barkentlne Irmgard, arrived here
yesterday, twenty-seven days from
the Island port and more than two
days behind the barkentine with which
ehe was racing for a homeward-bound
record. Captain Schmidt of the irmgarG
declares that the Annie Johnson's run to
Honolulu in ei&ht days sixteen hours was
a mere fluke, and that the rpal test of the
vessels' respective sailing qualities was
on the return passage, which the Irmgard
made in a little more than twenty-four
days.

cific. S. C. Nash, who, was employed In
the Texas Pacific office in' this. city, until
recently, has gone to Los Angeles, where
he will report for duty under T..D, Con

Jl movement has : been inaugurated by
the representatives of - the.- various roads
in Los Angeles to have the American As
sociation of General;- Passenger. ' Agents
hold its next annual meeting in. that. city.
Jay Adams, coast agent â¢ of < the Nickel
Plate line and president of the Pacific
Association of ' Railway Traffic Agents,
has promised to interest the local .mem
bers of his organization in the. matter,
and other representatives of Eastern lines
in this city are working in' the same di
rection. The idea is to have .the general
passenger agents meet- in the south at
the same time that the Knights '.Templar
conclave is being held in ihis 'city. It be
ing argued that the majority .; of , ; the
agents will come West to attend the con
clave and will llnd r lt convenient' to drop
down to Los Angeles to confer.with" their
railroad associates. ...
AFTER THE; CONVENTION.
eenger agent of the Southern Pacific
Company, has gone on a camping trip in
the southern paWof. "the" State. It is the
first time that he, has enjoyed' a ; vacation
in twenty-six ye'ars. " .

' Ford had been playing the races and
.was rendered .desperate for the lack of
funds. His defense was insanity, but at
his first trial he was convicted and-sen
tenced to serve ten years In San Quentin.
He appealed to the Supreme Court for, a
new trial and was successful, but was
again convicted. The Judge - sentenced
him to serve three, years Jn, San Quentin,
and in passing sentence took into account
the fact that he had been l in. custody
about two and a' half years; ' that .'his
previous record, aside-' from: the race
track. habit, was good and that his,con
duct in the penitentiary was exemplary.
Frank Murphy, who "was convicted of
an attempt to commit - burglary of the
first degree, was sentenced to serve seven
and a half years in San Quentin. He was
caught Centering, the bottling .establish
ment at 811 Brannan street on 'April 20.
There .were several prior convictions
against .him -for petty larceny. 'Â¦"Â¦Â¦'
Charles Murray, who = pleaded Â¦ guilty to
two charges of 'Â¦ grand -larceny, was sen
tenced to serve ten years in Folsom pen

RACES . CAUSE DOWNFALL.
The Judge passed sentence ' upon five
prisoners 'yesterday, one of them being
Marvin Ford, the well 'known' shoe sales
man, who, on February 16, 1901, assaulted
and robbed Lee Leon g, a Chinese mer
chant, on Sacramento' street, after fol
lowing him from the ; Nevada Bank. . .
The defendants held up and robbed Ben
jafeihv Farber, a peddler, at the point of
a revolver. on the San' BrunOj road on the
afternoon of April 9. They were tried for
robbery, but were convicted of grand lar
ceny. J,
When Arthur McGee and William Mc-
Carthy, both about 20 years of age, ap
peared before Judge Lawlor for sentence
yesterday on a charge . of grand larceny
their fathers begged for clemency. . and
also asked for delay, as the mother of
one of the boys was seriously ill. The
Judge deferred passing sentence for two
weeks, but said that he would be recreant
to his trust if he did not mete out severe
punishment to the defendants, as such
crimes ' as they had committed must be
stopped at all hazards. It was young men
of their age who were committing most
of the crimes of robbery and burglary in
the city and they must be taught 'a les
son. Â¦ ;^.,;;
Word was received in the city last night
from Omaha to the effect that as a result
of the recent conference there of the traf
fic representatives of the Rock Island and
Frisco roads a decision had been arrived
at whereby the offices of the two lines,
wherever possible, are to be merged and
that among those affected by this ruling
will be the offices of Atlanta, Cincinnati,
City of Mexico, Louisville, New York,
Pltsbur?, Salt Lake and this city.
The representatives of the Frisco line
in this city have been awaiting news of
the results of the meeting with consider
able anxiety and it would seem their
worst fears have been realized. The
Frisco line, which is now practically part
of the Rock Island system, has been rep
resented in this city for a number of
years by J. F. Edwards and H. E. Need
bam, the first named holding the title of
Pacific Coast agent and the other that of
commercial agent. The agency has sim
ply been maintained for freight purposes
and that it should be merged into the
Rock Island office, as reported, is not sur
prising to local, railroad men, although
naturally disappointing to the two of
ficials whose positions are jeopardized.
It Is, however, generally believed that
Edwards and Needham will be taken care
of in the Rock Island office.
PRESIDENT METCALFE HERE.
J. G. Metcalfe of Durango, president of
the Mexican International Railroad, ac
companied by the members of his family,
arrived from the south in a private car
yesterday and registered at the Palace.
It is Mr. Metcalfe's first visit to Cali
fornia.

tomed annual trip for the purpose of
gathering data.

SUPERVISORS' EXPENSES
NOT A COUNTY CHARGE
Attorney General Webb So Holds In
an Opinion Requested by Dis
trict Attorney Robinson.
In response to an Inquiry from A. K.
Robinson, District Attorney of Placer
County, Attorney General U. S. Webb has
rendered an opinion to. the effect that
under the county government act of 1901
the traveling and other personal expenses
of the Supervisors of Placer County in
curred in the performance of their du
ties as ex-offlcio Road Commissioners do
not constitute a county charge; that such
expenses must be oorne by the Super
visors, and they are not entitled to be
reimbursed therefor from the" county
treasury.
The opinion further stated that under
the county government act as to a num
ber-of counties it is provided .that the
members of the Board of Supervisors, in
addition to the compensation fixed by the
act, are entitled to their traveling and
other personal expenses incurred in the
performance of their duties as Road Com
missioners, but that in several ' other
counties, including the county of - iacer,
the provision providing for the payment
of â¢ personal expenses is omitted, and in
such counties claims for such expenses
do not constitute a county charge.
In response to a t request from L. N.
Peter t District Attorney, of Plifmas Coun
ty, the Attorney General holds, under the
same reasoning, that Supervisors are not
entitled to their personal expenses'in
curred in visiting the county hospital.
These opinions affect the Supervisors j of
a number of the counties of the State.

The "important business" which calls
the Rev. Mr. Jn.'iis from a charge which
is paid to be very congenial to him Is. ac
cording to a statement made by a promi
nent clerjryman of the Episcopal church,
neither more nor less than matrimony. T!ir!
rector of the church that has always been
Jhe representative In the whole West of
â¢what is - hishÂ«st" has. it is said, fallen
a victim to the bright eyes of a devout
little communicant, a daughter of an
army officer ami one of the fairest of all
the young damsels that have graced the
historic post of the Presidio. Forgotten
iire the vows of celibacy and Father Innis,
has decided to become a benedict.
Rumor is busy in. the church as to the
identity of the bride-to-be, but the secret
has been well kept. It is said that the
wedding will take place somewhere in the
East and before long. Whether Father
Innis will return to his present charge Is
problematical.
The congregation of the ritualistic
Church of 8t. Mary's the Virgin, at Union
and ' Steiner streets, has been of late
greatly perplexed over the incompre
hensible actions of its esteemed clergy
man. Rev. Stephen Innis, wb<y for the
past three years has been conducting the
services of the parish.
Though not in accord with the Bishop
of the diocese on the question of ritual
and church practice, the Rev. Mr. Innis
has met with no Interference from his
ecclesiastical superior "and might have
continued as rector of St. Mary's Indefi
nitely as far as Bishop Nichols was con
cerned. Tht*n it was announced that the
Rev. Mr. Innis had experienced a change
of heart and was about to join the Roman
â¢ â¢ommunion. This was afterward spe
cifically denied by the reverend gentle- 1
mau himself, who announced tha.t
he had askod for a year's vacation in
order that he tnipbt attend to certain
'"business" matters, the nature of which
he would not disclose.

One of the most popular of the younger
set now In London is Miss Fullerton, a
daughter of Vice Admiral Sir John Ful
lerton, G. C. V. O., who was so long in
command of his Majesty's yacht, Victoria
and Albert, and who is now Groom in
Waiting to his Majesty. Mlsa Fullerton's
mother is the daughter of the late Colonel
Edward Samuel Capel. and it will be re
membered that two of her sisters were
recently married to two naval officers.
Another young and lovely member of
the aristocratic set Is Miss Beatrice Pa

Lady Howard of Glossop, who, perhaps,

The Howards of Glossop are a branch of
the Duke of Norfolk's family, and the
present peer's sisters are severally Lady
Loudon, Lady Herries and Lady Bute.
Lady Churchill, like her clever and dis
tinguished husband, has long been a fa
vorite at court. She was, before her
marriage, Lady Verena Maud Lowther.
She and Lord Churchill elected to be
married on the New Year's Day of 1SS7,
and, doubtless owing to the fact that the
Dowager Lady Churchill was one of the
most intimate friends of Queen Victoria,
her late Majesty showed great interest In
the new peeress, and became sponsor to
both her children. Both Lord and Lady
Churchill are high In the favor of the
present sovereign, and Lord Churchill

occasion of the coronation.

commissioned by the Czar to make a

A number of persons previously dis

The Frankfurter Zeitung says it learns
from the same source that former Gov

correctly during the massacres.
WASHINGTON. July U.-Information
of an entirely reliable character concern

appears that the protests which are made
in the United States and many other civ

tacks upon the Jews in Kishenev last
spring have not been without practical ef

Kussian Government has been moved to
vigorous action in the matter of investi

Eight hundred arrests have been made
and as a result of the preliminary exam

PARIS, July 11.â One of the most In
teresting and decidedly the most
useful and popular groups of
American personalities in Paris is
one that is not to be measured by the
size of the coupon cut or the monthly
output of a Western wealth belcherâ by
the show made before the many-eyed
whose gaze the glitter draws and holds.
With the people of Paris, from Premier
to populace, no one American, however
voluminous his roll or lavish his spend-
Ings, is more generally known or held in
better esteem than Consul General
Gowdy, whoso genial face and affable
bearing win for him favor on every hand,
r;ora foreigner as well as fellow country.
it. an.
Having won his present honorable and
responsible position by his own merit,
Mr. Gowdy has since his appointment by
PreEident McKiiJey in 1S37 fulfilled the
multifarious duties of his office, Incl-
dental as well as official, fn a manner
that has won the approbation of all
Americans who have come into contact
with him, andc ommanded the respect and
confidence of both the Government which
accredited him and the one receiving him.
In the ultra-official demands that come
upon him, which aie not few and often
of great urgency, the Consul General has
the hearty and able support of his good
and helpful wife and daughter. The lat
ter is the inseparable companion of her
father and mother and their efficient aid
in all they take in hand to do.
To them comes the first complaint of
the stranded traveler away from home,
broken, discouraged and maybe sick unto
death. Never are their ears deaf- to the
pica of a needy countryman, and never
do they fail to aid materially, as well as
otherwise, the distressed in mind, body
or estate. ;
To the sick and dying they have been
ministering angels; to the erring they
havÂ« been good Samaritans, indeed. It
is not at all strange that they 1 are be
loved by all that know themâ that every
American returning from Paris should
have "a good word" for the Gowdys.
And with all the demands made upon
them in connection with the consular of
fice the Gowdys have found time to en
dear themselves to a wide circle of
Parisians as well as the members of the
American colony. The Consul General is
a most approachable man In his office, as
is the family in the home, in the Rue de
la Pompe, where the generous hospitality
engendered and practiced on the broad
acred farm back. in Rush County, In
diana, welcomes without stint.
At their receptions are to be found the
artist, the musician and the writer, as
well as the people of the society world,
and all are made to feel at home.
, In this phase of the family life, as her
mother is of a naturally retiring dispo
sition, Miss Fanny Gowdy takes the lead.
Endowed with many natural attractions,
well educated before leaving her Indiana
home, where she had all the refining ad
vantages 'that wealth could, give: with
wide experience of travel in America and
in Europe, of "quick observation and re
fined judgment, she is . in every degree
competent to fill the position of semi
official aid . and ' social director for her

VIENNA, July "; 11.â In official eyes.
Princess Hohenberg is a personage, of no
importance whatever, for, : although she
is the wife of the heir to the crown^of
Austria, her marriage was a morganatic
one. Moreover, before the ceremony was
held she formally and in the most solemn
fashion renounced any rights or privileges
or claims to precedence which it might
give her. .
Nevertheless socially her position -is
very different from that of other morgan
atic wives, for whereas thejvare for the

cess Hohenberg belongs by birth to the

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, JULY 12, 1903.
PARIS, July 11.â An American million
aire whose name has not been made pub
lic is stated to have purchased the for
mer mansion of the Governor of Paris in
the Place Vendome for 2,700,000 francs
($540,000).
It is said that he will transform the
building into a handsome theater, give it
his own name and erect a bust of himself
on the staircase. Only lyric plays will ba

Free Musical Library.
OF greatest interest to tho music
lover is the new musical depart
ment that in a few days from now
will be thrown open in our Free Public
Library. As some will remember, the
question of such a collection for tho Free
L!brary was pretty widely discussed some
months ago. To Mme. Kmelia Tojettl,
whose presidency of the music section of
the California Club has been variously
and pleasantly memorable, belongs tho
honor of having set this ball rolling. The
importance of such collection In the form
ation of musical taste in the community
has, of course, long been recognized; lo
cally, however, the question had been Ig
nored until a few months ago, when Mme.
Tojettl made her plea to the authorities.
Bristling with statistics from libraries all
over the country, of the demonstrated
usefulness of the music library, of its
popularity, of the character and extent of
the various collections, the lady then elo
quently voiced the local need. That was
at Christmas time, and now, a day or
two hence will see the modest opening of
our free public library of music. , : .
It will, in truth, be quite a modest af
fair. Our city fathers have as yet been
able to devote only $200 to the purpose,
but that the fund has been most wisely
expended the following list will witness.
Here again many thanks should go Mme.
Tojetti's way. Not only to her is owing
the suggestion for the choice of the
music thus far, but the admirable repre
sentative list of operas that the collec
tion contains has been enriched by eight
een works from her own library. Let you
and I do so much, good music lover, and
the San Francisco library will very short
ly be a thing of pride. ...
Inevitably, and quite properly In San
Francisco, the operatic element was
given in Mme. Tojetti's list,
but lt /! wlll be noted that there is also a
.A Â¦ â¢Â¦-.--*-Â¦Â¦
rate what we might send them.
"They say that it is never too late to
learn," said Lillian Burkhart the other
day. "but I must confess that I had never
thought that it would bo necessary for
me to take up stage dancing. No. I hava
no ambition to become a premier dan
seuse. but I have just purchased a new
sketch entitled The Man and the Bur
glaress,' which I will uso In the vaude
ville houses this fall, anJ In it I am re
quired to dance. A dancing burglarÂ«s9
ought to be something of a novelty. It
is terrible, though, to think of having to
practice several hours a day In the hot
summer under an unfeeling danclns mas
ter. My new sketch was played at a
benefit performance at the Waldorf-As
toria by Blanche Bates and Robert T.
Halnes, where it scored a great hit. I
expect it to be one of the most successful
sketches that I have ever U3ed."
Henry W. Savage has announced that
Raymond HitchcQck will create the lead-
Ing role In "The Yankee Consul." the new
comic opera by Henry M. Blossom Jr.
and Alfred G. Robyn. Mr. Hitchcock is
at present in Italy and will visit Paris,
Berlin and London before he returns to
this country In August. "The Yankea
Consul" will be produced upon an elabor
ate scale by Mr. Savage early in me comÂ«
ing season.
J. H. Stoddart, who is starring In "The

useful oratorio and cantata selection and
a goodly set of four-hand symphony ar
rangements for pianoforteâ those next
best things to the scores. But here end
eth the fair beginnings of our library.
Some talk there is already, however, of
adding the pianoforte and violin and
pianoforte sonatas at an early date, but
the appended list is complete up to to
day. It is designed to add to the collec
tion from time to time at the suggestion
of prominent musicians, and certainly no
more useful outlet for private beneficence
will suggest itself.
And now. What is done by the trustees
in the future will depend almost wholly
upon tho public Interest taken in the mat
ter, and if I knew my San Francisco, it
will not be lacking here. A matter of
large moment is the circulation question,
that will immediately present Itself to the
trustees on the opening of ' tho music
shelvesâ that is. as to whether the music
shall be put into circulation or kept for
reference only. If the latter, its "useful
ness will be seriously impaired until a
music-room with a pianoforte is part of
the library equipment. Again, if it Is put
Into circulation its referential value will
be nil. Here a double set of scores, one
for reference, one for circulation, is the
only completely satisfactory solution of
the difficulty. But in default of the
double series, and of the music-room,* it
would certainly seem wiser to put the
present collection into circulation. In the
Eastern libraries, where there are refer
ence and circulation departments both, it
is usual to reserve for circulation operatic
scores, oratorios, cantatas, piano, piano
and violin and song literature. And now,
with best wishes to the new library, I
give with pleasure the following list of
its modest riches:

Writing In the Theater Magazine for
July, Albert'E. Lancaster, the playwright,
says:
What is the reason that England and
the Contingent continue to exercise over
us a fascination, as far as the stase is
concerned, which we are very seldom _able
to exercise over them? Irving, for in
stance, has been visiting this country
continually for tho last twenty years.
Does any one suppose he would do so un
less he made a good deal more money
here than in hie native land? But. do we
ever hear of Mansfield acting In London,
and then making a successful tour of the
British provinces? Yet, Mansfield is. In
many respects, as good an actor as Ir
ving, and there are those who think him
better. Miss Terry has been received
here with delight on Innumerable occa
sions; yet the late Augustln Daly sank
very many thousands of dollars in trying
to establish Miss Rehan in Londonâ and
she is. In various roles, as oharmin* as
the English actress. Upon very rare oc
casions an American star, through a for
tunate combination of circumstances,
makes a successful London appearance,
and may count upon a cordial rewelcome.

"Sangsfor Scotsmen Far Frae Hame" is
the self-explanatory title of a quaint pub
lication that comes to me this week. The
songs, four in number, are a product of
local genius, the words by James Smith,
the music by George St. John Bremnerf
Both aro wholesome and pleasing and will
doubtless prove of interest to the Scot
"far frae hame." "The Thistles" pos
sesses more than ordinary merit. It Is
very singable and has an unmistakable
Scotch lilt, which, ( indeed, is common to
the series. "The : St. Andrews" has a
fine patriotic swing and words that will
warm the cockles of every guid Scotch
heart. The get-up of the little sheet Is
very attractive, with its brave tartan and
thistles. (Publishers, Smith & Brenmer;

Ciore of. the wonderful old similes our
grandmammas used to make come up as
one looks at Miss Mabel McKinley. For
a variety of reasons I decided that "the
favorite niece of the late President Mc-
Kinley" was to me the most interesting
figure of the moment. Last Sunday saw
her debut into vaudevilleâ from a person
cf privileged privacy to a star commer
cially worth $12j'3 a week. I wanted to
know how it felt to become suddenly so
valuable. Then Miss McKinley"s papa,
Abner McKinloy, offered his daughter
JCC'.OOQ, and her husband. Dr. Baer. offered
liis wife S10.0UO to abstain from the foot
light career. I wanted to know the young
lady's determining motive in setting aside
their wishes. Again, there is a lively dis.
russion afoot as to the relative values of
the singer's voice and name. I wanted
her opinion on the subject. Further, there
are thoseâ not a fewâ to whom the use
of the late President's name in the con
nection is strongly distasteful. I thought
his "favorite niece" must have something
cf interest to say in the matter. Then
those pathetic little crutchesâ the fact
that it would be Miss McKinley's debut
interview â a score, indeeÂ«i, of interests de
tided my choice of Fubject for the week.
Accordingly 2 p. m. on Tuesday last
found me, with my artist accomplice. In
the Palace elevator. There was not far
to go. A suite on the first floor, facing
Market street, is one of the accompani-
Ti.ents of a tl'JM a week salary. It was
n borer of roses into which we were in
troduced, f Hosts, roses everywhere, ex
cept where there were carnations â on the
l:iano, on the mantelpiece, all over the
tabics. and Miss McKinley in the midst
of them like a great central blossom. She
came forward, smiling, on her crutches
and gave us greeting. She had first to
decide upon her next week's programme
at the Orpheum, and said so.
"How wouid the 'Jewel Song' from
'Faust' do for the first number?" Miss
McKinley appealed to the company.
The "Jewel Song " was decided upon,
and then came the question of the other
numbers. Miss McKtnley thought "La
Danza" of Chadwiek would be delightful
for the second song if it were sufficiently
popular in character, though recognizing
the reasonableness of Mr. Morrisey's re
quest for the imminent "Violets." Her
own song, "Anona," that has got Into
the gallery whistle, she thought, "there
had been enough of."
"There is a darling little Japanese love
fong that might go for the third." she
f'na'ly suggestedâ "all about a maid who
lived on a lantern and her swain on a
package of tea."
But whether this is the programme you
will get this afternoon at the Orpheum is
not for me to say. Mr. Morrisey may
yet get his "Violets," and Miss McKin
kfjr may have changed her mindâ she is a
woman.
And there I'm wrong. Miss McKinley

In thingsâ in her success, in her fiowers,
in her hats, in her singingâ is purely
charming. She is the essence of good
rature, even as radiantly amiable as she
looks, and unaffected naturalness itself.
I began unconventionally: "Miss Mc-
JCinl^y, you have a very charming black
hat that I know Mr. Cahill would prefer
to the one you are wearingâ he tells me
he likes them that way. May we please
have it?"
"Certainly," she gurgled, and handing
the handsome erection, all ingenuous blue
feathers and spreading brim, to the maid,
change it for the black "creation" that
an-ears in the portrait. Then she pouted:
"But I did all that for your benefit. This
black hat has b^en used in so many pic
tures. Still, it goes with this gown and
that's something."
"This gown" was of black velvet, and
eminently characteristic of the wearer in
its quaint, ornatr mode. It left the plump

brown, was worn in what I am informed
is a "Norma Whalley dip" in front and
with two coquettish curls falling from
the knot at the back.
"You like clothes, don't you?" I asked.
Bl^ss her! I knew she did!
"Indeed I do," she laughed, her face
about the lips crumpling Into dimples by
the down. "But I had to put this dress
on to keep warm. There you sit in a lawn

I held one of the little cold hands for a
moment and then said: "You're frigh

"Indeed I'm not." cried Miss McKinley,

"Bui it is your first inter%-iew?"
"Ye6," Ehe beamed, "but it's lovely."

"Now will you pleaee tell Jhe public how

replied, fingering the Irregular gems with
their golden links with a childlike pride.

however, an Irreverent flash of reminis

quite weepy about It"â and the large, blue
eyes filled with quick ingenuous tears.
"President McKinley's niece could hard
ly have received any other kind of recep
tion here," I venture.
But Miss McKinley was silent for a
moment.
"I don't like to say anything about
uncle," she said at length, hesitating and
suddenly grave, yet all anxious candor.
"You know, I can't help being his nieceâ
and, of course, I am intensely proud of

to succeed on my own merits."
"You will," I interpolate.
"Then they have said." and Miss Mc-
Kinley's pink cheeks grew a little pinker,
"that I am in this work just for the sake
of the money."
"How dreadful!"
"Why," she went on, in eager refuta
tion, "I hadn't the least Idea how much
money could be made in this wayâ though
1 am not telling the managers so* now!
But to me It's the greatest thing in the
world to please people with singing. And
I'm so humbly grateful for my success."
"How do you like Orpheum audiences
compared with the concert crowds?" I
question.
"Oh, I like them!" and the singer's eyes
glistened in testimony. "This is the
grand public, the big, big people. They're
with you. They're a thousand times more
responsive than the concert crowd. What
with patrons shoving concert tickets
down one's throat all thÂ« time, no won
der the audiences are cold. The Orpheum
people are there to enjoy themselves, and
when they do, they do. â¢ â¢ â¢ I was
frightened of the gallery, to tell the
truth. Mr. and Mrs. Morseâ our relations
hereâ kept telling me the gallery might
hiss me, and 'then you're done for," they
said. But they didn't, did they?"
"Hardly," I said t remembering the tu
multuous whistles that had greeted the
singer on Sunday night. "And now, what
is to follow?"
"Oh, everything is just beginning." the
little singer cried. "Just think what I've
got lo do yet"â as if a ruck of hard work
were the pleasantest thing in the world
to contemplate. "It means study, study,
study! One thing I'm A. little bit proud
of. I've always studied people's manner
on the stage, comic opera, grand opera,
all kinds of manner, what made them
pleasing to the audience. And I think
really that mv deportment is not very
awkward for a beginner."
"Please remember I said so," I gently
insist, beginning to find the rosy jass
before me more mature than I had imag
ined.
"Yes, what you 6aid was lovelyâ please
put that in." as I obediently do. "I've
sent lots of your notices East Funny.
I never read the newspapers much be
fore, but I read hardly anything else
now."
"Aren't you a pupil of Victor Capoul?"
I then ask.
"Yes. and of Margaret Elliottâ to whom
Melba recommended me, and of Isidore
Luckstone, whom I think splendid," she
answered. "I believe you can get all
you need in Americaâ tone placing and
that sort of thing, perhaps better than
on the Continent. We are more practi
cal here. Of course we haven't the musi
cal atmosphere yet, and that's a great
thing. But I think you can get as good
teaching here ae anywhere."
"Nordica told me the same thing," I
said.
"Did she? How lovely!" said Miss Mc-
Kinley. showing all her white teeth in
a delighted laugh. "$>
"And now tell me just how you made
up vour mind to take the final step to
the stageâ your people didn't like It?" I
ask.
The full, red mouth drooped a little at
the corners a<= the young vaudevillain an
swered: "I don't know. I Just did it.
Really, I had rather a hard timeâ but
they're all resigned now." and I thought
that resignation was probably the part
of wisdom where Miss Mabel's whims
were concerned. She resumed thoughtful
ly, "I think it is the fear that one will
l>e' hurt by not succeeding that makes
one's friends eo averse to seeing one go
on the stage. Don't you? 1- allure seems
to be even harder on one's friends than

"And so th;y are all resigned now?"

that one would be so beautifully treated

"And am I also to have an autograph?"
I smiled. "JL'd like one on one of those
