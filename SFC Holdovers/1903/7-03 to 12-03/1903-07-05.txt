than Noel Brent, whom I used to think
the nnest-lookinff man I had ever | seen

on his shoulder, just shutting my eyes,
without speaking a word. I thought then
âfor I was so worn In body and soul with
the strain of keeping up â that after death
the best naradlse would be to lean my
head on Maxime's. shoulder, like this, for
two or three hundred years. But even as
the peaceful idea came into my head back
darted remembrance like a stinging adder.
I remembered how little I deserved paxa

because It amused me; oftener because I

As I left the stage at last, having re
turned for five curtain culls at the end
of the first act. I met near my dressing
room men carrying large harps and
crowns and wreaths of flowers which had
been thrown to me on the stage, or sent
round from -the stage door. I hardly
looked at them, for Maxine was there,
too, waiting for me. He had come from,
the box, and he followed Into the boudoir
which, adjoins the dressing-room. There
we, were alone. And I have five minutes
to spare him before I need dress for the
next act.
I felt myself color up under Margot'*

stammered out my answer like a school

hardly knowing myself in my loutish
awkwardness; for usually I am a cool
hand enough, or at least have the nerve
to appear so. Yet now, when I would
have given a finger to control myself. I
went to pieces under the' battery of Mar

something was amiss.
"Ha. haV he laughedi -"Well.- go, my

Somehow I got away, my ears tinsjlinr.
I did not look back, but the last thing I
heard was Margot' a laugh, which, sweet
as it was. went through me like a knife.
It wanted five minutes to 13 . when I
reached the street. Midnight was striking
by the time I was seated in a cab and
driving toward the Rue d'Anjou. I was
late for the appointment after allâ only
a few minutes which General Gawain had
Judged so insignificant ; yet what a dif

Told by Juliette de Never* -
CHAPTER VIL^." ; V
COWARD CONSCIENCE AND A GAMB
OF BLUFF. ,
How I got through my part on that
awful night I don't know. .
When I first went on the stage, to take
up my cue at the end of the first act,
my. brain was a blank. I could not re
member a single line that I had to say
when I tried to project my mind ahead.
I saw no one on the stage. I did not even
see Maxine de Ribaumont. though X
knew he was in the box: but I seemed to
feel him looking at me. I felt hl3 great
love coming down to my chilled heart
like a warming ray of sunlight. I felt
the Influence of his desire for my success.
For him. I must not fall. I had never
failed, and I would not now.
So it was. though I could not have re
peated a word from nay part before X
went on the stage. I found myself an
swering cue after, cue as I received them.
Applause came surging up to my ears
like a great tidal wave. The ' audience
was mine to do with as I would; yet for
once I feared it. as If it had been a great
tiger purring as It crouched to spring,
for I thought. "What if it knew the thinif
that I had done? What if a voice should
cry out that Juliette dc Nevera had be
trayed France and the ally of Franceâ
that she had stolen the treaty of alliance
and sent it to the enemyâ England ! How
those hands which beat themselves to
gether, now to applauding me would itch
to grasp my throat.
Still. I went on. An actress can always
go onâ till she breaks. I think thut she
cannot be bent like other women; ah, I
envy the other women who are not skilled
to hide things. It seems to me that they
must suffer less. . ; .V,
tn the season," hreke fa Lady Oairata,
looking smilingly at the traveling clothes
which I still wore. "1 think, Margot. 1*
you and Marlon and I join your uncle In
asking Mr. Brent to stay and drink suc
cess to the motor-car deal that he won't
refuse."
She was the kindest woman on earth;
but If she had deliberately tried to clothe
her. Invitation in the terms most em
barrassing to me, she could not have
chosen her words better.

my reasons for wishing Margot to be
anywhere rather than here at this hour. I
could not h^lp rejoicing in the sight of
her. and especially in. that blush.
"It's a good wind that blows us all to

hearty, but rather absent-minded way.
"Sit down with us and have some
supper."
"Mr. Brent has Just finished his supper,
don't you Â«Â«e, Uncle Robert," remarked
Margot. hastily. - .
"What does that matter?" retorted the
old officer.' "Can't he eat another, or if
he can't do that, what's to prevent him
from sitting with us while we eat ours?"

not help fancying was mingled with wist

obliged to come to France on important
businessâ that is, there's" a wonderful

I thought. It was a good omen that ehe
should have consented to come to France
to-day. Of course, the could not have
known at what hotel I meant to stop, and
even if she had she would probably have
tried to persuade the Gawains to go to
another. Still the very fact that, after
what had passed in the morning, she; was
willing to breathe the air of Paris with
me was something. She must have
known that we might meet, and she had
been willing to run the risk. â¢
I hardly needed the small comfort to be
pot from this reflection; for the moment
Lady Gawain mentioned the. name of
Captain Menzies I remembered something
which Miss Sltgreaves had said to me not
long ago. She had "told me " that there
was a Captain Menzies. a godson of Lady
Ga wain's, - of whom aunt waa
always talking to her. They had never
met, but when he came back from South
Africa. Lady Gawain would (according to
"I am even more surprised to -see you
than you can poEs'bly be to eee me." I
said to Lady Gawain and* at Margot.
And I was wondering for all I was worth
who could be the new man with them.
HÂ« was a good-looking chap, like a sol
dier, and he stood close to Margot. I was
vilely jealous of himâ for one bears of

Instead of doing something to regain my

make matters worseâ If they could, be
worse.
But at least I had one moment to spare
â or to stealâ from that grim fate, and I
resolved to make ' the most cf it.
She was not alone, but for an Instant
In which we looked straight into each
other's eyes I saw no one else. There
was only her beautiful face in the world;
but in a few seconds, when I had come
to myself, I heard familiar voices and
realized that Margot was one of the
party. She was with her aunt. Lady
Gawain. and her aunt's husband, General
L*>rd Gawain; her cousin, Marion Slt
greave.*. and e manâ a young manÂ«â whom
I had never : 'seen before. And It was
IxÂ»rd and I^ady Gawain, not my darling
girl, who spoke to me in amazed recog
nition. They were old v friends of mine,
and. in -fact, it was at Lady Gawaln's
house near Marlow that I had first met
the Horn* Secretary's daughter.

thought Margtot Revelstoke's ' the - most

dimple flashes into each, cheek, and her
great eyes turn suddenly into stars. It is
the most bewildering effect imaginable,
and it made my -pulses give a bound to-

her heart was not in the smile. She only
wished to eeem exactly the same as ever
before her companions, in whom she had
evidently not confided either our under

had so swiftly followed. As she smiled

not resist the temptation to press it. But
though I hoped for jtift the faintest, re
sponse, her little fingfrs lay stiffly in my
grasp for the fraction of a second, then
relentlessly freed themselves. She meant
me to see that, no matter how conven
tionalities might force her to behave, she
had not forgotten nor forgiven. I was
horribly unhappy, just at the timeâ had
all ben well with meâ when I ought to
have been the most deliriously ecstatic

In some as yet -inexplicable manner; and
while I might have been striving after a
reconciliation, I was imperatively called
by the voice of honor to go somewhere
else â that somewhere else the one place
of all others where Margot would be the
angriest with me for going.
By the time Monsieur Dubols had been
primed with such facts as .1 ventured to
give him It was after 11 o'clock. I could
do nothing more for the moment, end as
I was half famished (I'd bad nothing to
eat since a very light luncheon on the
boat) I returned to my hotel not far off
and had a hasty supper. When I had
finished I knew that the first perform
ance of the new play at the Theater de la
Republique was over, and that If I went
to Juliette de Never*' house In the Ru<
d'Anjoul should find her alone., waiting
for me. eagerly expecting me.
In ordinary circumstances there would
either have been a supper on the stage
with Juliette as hostess, or she would
have taken guests home with her. or 6he
would herself have been the most distin

night she would have made some excuse
to escape as soon as the play was over,
and eo to her house unattended. 1 waa
as sure of this as that I was alive. \ '
My watch told me that It was a quarter
to 12. In a cab I could reach Juliette's
6treet in seven or eight minutes. I would
leave the vehicle at the corner and go to
the house on foot, as it would not be well

The detective, still with rather an odd
expression on bis face, promised to do his
best, and to keep his mouth shut. On the

like a person who knew his business, and

claimed It to Noel Brent; yet I knew,

I had forgotten. Desperate perplexity and
nerve-killing excitement had driven the
recollection from my mind. I could feel
'the blocd rush up to my face, then ebb
;away again, and I knew that Maxime saw
the change with surprise â for, unlike most

my complexion bears the glare of the

love me less?" X asked, dwelling upon the
subject with a kind cf fearful fascination,
such as I have found in hanging over the
brink of a sheer precipice.
"Nothing on God's earthâ while you
were true to me."
"And If I deceived you?"
"Thenâ I think I would kill youâ and kill
Â»yse!f. But why speak of such things?
I knowâ strange as It seems that you can
âhow you do love me, or you would not
have given to much to save me from
rum."

He thought It was but my excitement
In playing for the first time a heavy and
trying part. X could see In bis eyes, hear
In his voice, that never had he worshiped
me as on this night Since he had brought
himself to accept the loan I had insisted
upon rnf Mrg, to help him out of the dif
ficulty in which he had been Involved
by the loss ef the necklao*. be had re
garded me as th* angel of his salvation.
Now I had news Cor him t* fill his heart
with Joy. He woold love me more than
before, if possible, and X would take his
love as my right, and hid* th* secret of
ray treachery as long as I could. But how
long would It be? How could I tell that
at this moment th* theft of the treaty
bad not been discovered, aad that the
avalanche was not about to overwhelm
us both?
â¢ What can be worse for a woman than
the secret knowledge that to hold her

no future puniFhment. She has all â all
thf deserves while on this earth. I real
ized it at that moment and the realiza

Maxime. I could only shudder and sob
In his arms.
put me away in horror If he knew me
lor the Judas that -I was.'
For years I had been a political spyâ
yeÂ«. But I owed a grudge to Franc* and
Russia, which I had promised my father
to pay. And besides, it is different to de
Â«he a country from what it Is to de
ceive the man you adore. We women are
true to Individuals. For them we would
all sacrifice a cause; and never had I suf
fered Buch acute torture as I did at that
moment in the shameful thought that
Maxime de RJbaumontâ honorable, noble
cherished In me a traitor; that even If
*uin did not overwhelm us, nothingâ noth
ing on earth could wash the stain from
the heart he believed to be pure.
He bowed acquiescence and moved back,
that the groom might receive his instruc
tions; and five minutes later he was sit
ting in the brougham beside me, with
Agnes seated opposite.
"Now," I began, : abruptly, in Russian,
cutting short bis fulsome praises of my
acting, "what have you to say. to me?"
I was determined to stand cautiously on
the defensive, letting each decisive move
be made by the adversary. "My maid
speaks only French." -.-_ ' .
"Why are -you bo cruelly, harsh?" he
exclaimed. "How have* I ever offended
"I will stop for you at the corner of the
Rue Boulanger: it would not do, as you
must know, for me to take you In here,"
I whispered, hurriedly. â¢ .. Â¦Â¦',
I was veiled, and I did not turn my eyes
to the right or left as I walked from the
stage door to the brougham, which, as I
had expected, was in its place. It was
not for me to look about for Ipanoff: It
was for him to be awaiting me, and so it
fell out As my groom opened the door
for me. the Russian stepped forward with
a "Good evening, mademoiselle," softly
pronounced in his hated voice.
My brougham would be waiting for me.
I knew, and my plan, was to speak to
Ipanoff. and then take him up a little
later, allowing him to drive with me and
Agnes, who always accompanied < ma
home. We would talk, together In Rus
sian, of which Agnes did not understand
a word; but her presence would be. a pro
tection, and, In case Ipanoff dared to ex
ceed the limits of my forbearance, I had
but to press an electric button close to
my hand for the carriage to be stopped
and the English groom (a stout fellow
and devoted to me) to appear at the win
dow.
"That is more easily promised than
some other things," said Maxime, smil
ing. "And I thank you a thousand times
in advance. Shall I tell you *hat I hope I
Ehall find?â the miniature of yourself In
a frame, and with a chain to hand round
my neck over my heart, such as you have
eaid you would give me some day. It
feels like that in my hand." As he spoke
he thrust the little bag with Its precious
contents into an Inside pocket of his coat.
Then there was nothing more for him to
say except the good-night which I was
waiting forâ hating, yet longing to hear.
When he was gone I made Agnes hurry
me out of the gold and white brocade of
Helolse. and into my own inconspicu
ous black dress and cloak which 1 had
worn to call az>on Noel Brent at the
Elysee Palace Hotel. Already it was half
past 11, and I had to see Count Ipanoff
and reach my own house by midnight. In
time to receive Noel. I was thankful that
Maxime's unselfish and trusting love for
me had rendered him for once .bo easy to
manage, and I could only hope that no
prying person might witness my meeting
with the Russian to make mischief \a the
future. ''.-9. t . -w ~'>
I went quickly, as I finished speaking,
from the . boudoir to â¢ the dressing-room,
where Agnes was putting away my things
for the night She never leaves the room
when I am out of it. lor she is a dragon
in guarding my jewels, which are pretty If
not very valuable. To-night the famous
necklace was in the box with such of my
own things as I had not sold or pawned
for Maxime. I had left the queer red
leather case with Noel Brent, and brought
the diamonds away with me in my
pocket; but as soon as I reached the thea
ter, unseen by Agnes, I had slipped the
necklace into a little embroidered eilk bag
in which I sometimes carried a purse and
handkerchief. This I had thrust into. the
jewel-box, eo that unconsciously my maid
was guarding 600,000 francs' worth of dia
monds, not counting my few trifles.
Earlier In the evening I meant before
leaving the theater to give the necklace
to Maxime and enjoy his surprise and re
lief at the sight of it. But now I had
changed my mind. It was necessary to
get rid ef Maxime (hateful as those words
sound in connection with one so dearly
loved) aa soon as possible, lest he and
Count Ipanoff should meet and Maxime
entirely misunderstand the nature of my
appointments with the latter. "Besides, I
was unprepared with an answer for the
questions Maxime was certain to ask me
In connection with the mysterious recov
ery of the diamonds. After having talked
with Noel Brent everything might be dif
ferent, and at all events I should know
better what to say.
With this resolve. I took the embroi
dered bag from my jewel-box and gave It
with Its ribbons tightly knotted, to Max
ime. "This holds something which you
will think precious," I announced, "par
ticularly as I have been at some trouble
to get it for you. So, for my sake, don't
open the bag to see what Is Inside until
you are at home In your bedroom with
the door locked."
"Only that I think I love you more
than I ever did before, andâ I suppoie It's
the fault of that last sceneâ I have a
wretched, inexplicable sense of impend
ing lots."
The words had a specially sharp edge
for meâ one that he did not dream of
giving. But I dared not let him see how
they pierced me. "It will be all the
eweeter to meet to-morrow." I assured
him. "Promise me that you will ge
straight home and dream of me as I shall
of you. Then to-morrow before you begin
the day's work stop and see me. I shall
be up and ready to receive you, no mat
ter how early It may be. But now, to
reward you for being good, I have some
thing for youâ something that you will
like very much."
"Don't think that X do not want yon to
be with me," I said.' "I d* want youâ
oh, more than you can guess! But I am
so tiredâ I am almost 11L When I asked
you to have supper with me I did not
realize how utterly worn out I was."
"My dearest!" he exclaimed. "Then X
will not be selfish. You will go home and
straight to bed. But you will let mo
drive with you to the door?"
"Even to that I must say no," X In
sisted, miserably, straining every nerve
to be plausible, to convince him of my
wisdom, and not to pain him too much.
"You see," I went on. "I did not mean,
evea whea I first asked you to suppe*
to let you drive home with me from th*
theater. We are engaged to be married*
and If people knew that they would be
disarmed, for aa actress may do, many
things which a woman ef society could
not do without scandal But they do not
know and must not know quite yet,
therefore I must be prudent I must not
appear to grant you favors which I will
-not grant to others; and I have never re
ceived any other man alone after the the
ater. You should be glad that this Is
true."
"Of course I am glad and proud," said
Maxime. "But It's horribly hard to see
no more of youâ to-night of all nights."
"Why to-night of all nights?" I was
suspicious in my guilty cowardice again.
man X pretended to be had died on the
stage, and been resurrected Into the wo
man I must be In real life, all the press-
Ing problems had to be solved at once.
First there was Maxime to be put off
and pacifiedâ Maxime, whose help and
loving protection I needed so much, yet
must deny myself, and hurt him Instead.
He wa* waiting for me again at th*
door of my boudoir, and I had at least
one thing to be thankful forâ I had denied
myself to everybody else, refusing all In
vitations for the evening after th* thea
ter. He took my hands and kissed them
passionately; but his face was pal* and
aad. and my coward conscience gave m*
a quick stab of fear.
"What Is the matter?" I asked, whll*
Inside my head there was a shrieking
question! "What If the news had come
to him? What If already something has
happenedâ the beginning of the end?"
X could have cried with the snapping of
the tension when he answered: "It was
only that terrible sceneâ your death, as
Helolse, my dear one. It was so horribly
real. It was all X could. do to sit still In
the box and bear It I wanted to spring

Henri is a well-trained, old servant, and
his face was. expressionless; yet I knew,
as his "eye moved about the drawing room,
that he was surprised to find me alone.
"If the person knocking is the Comte

said. "Andâ Henriâ nobody else has been
here to-night since I returned from the
theater." , *',v>'
1 "Very . well, mademoiselle: I quite un

movable countenance.
He went without another word into my
boudoir, which adjoins the drawing room.
The key was in the door. I turned it in
the lock, snatched It out, and t slipped it
into my pocket Hardly had I done so
when Henri appeared at the only' other
doorâ the one leading into the entrance
hall.
. "Mademoiselle." he quietly announced,
'.'somebody knocks. Is it that you left the
gate unlocked? -And am I to admit any
one?". f.r-.'l';- '^-V-'i : Â¦
"Don't stand there arguing and advis
ing!" I cut in. In a fierce whisper. "He's
knocking again for the third time. Go
goâgo!" .
"I daren't. I'd forbidden him to come
here. I told him I was ill. and must go
straight to bed. He saw me with Count
Ipanoff, and now. if he finds you with
me what wilt he think? Yet the door
must be answered. Listen to that knock

Henri let him In. Oh why do you delay?
Go into the next room. You can get out
through the window and leave the house
while Maxime and I are talking;."
"I'll do what you wish," said Noel. "But
I beg of you take my advice, and don't
attempt to deceive him. Better let
mÂ» â " â¢ ,
"Let him in, and tell him that I came
to see you on important business from a
friend in England, which could not await
till to-morrow."
As I spoke there came a knock at the
front door. Maxime's knock, I was cer
tain. I grew giddy, and my presence of
mind deserted me* " If only Noel had
come when he promised by this time he
would have been gone: but now I knew
not what to do for the best. I had suf
fered to much that my power of prompt
decision seemed dead.
"It is Maxime, I know," X whispered.
"What is to be done?"
We were standing In the drawing-room,
and the silk curtains were drawn across
the big bow window, yet mechanically
my eyes turned to it, and my heart was
beating fast "What if it should be Max
ime?" I exclaimed.
"Hush!" I broke in. catching him by
the arm. "I heard a step outside on the
gravel. I forgot to lock the gate. Did
you do it?"
"No," he answered In a low voice.
"I was very sorry to be late." said NoeL
"Iâ met some friends at the hotel Just
as I, was leaving, and was obliged to say
a few words to them. Then, when I had
got into a cab the wretched hone fell
down, and I had to walk after all, as
there wasn't another In sight, and "
"If I had known he would be so late,"
I said, rather reproachfully, "I might
have allowed him to come home with me
for a few moments, but as It was I
dared not; for Maxlme's one fault is
Jealousy."
"Even if Dubols . Is IpanofTs friend.**
said Noel, "it Isn't likely that the Rus
sian would be fool enough to confide his
designs against you to any one, no mat
ter how great the intimacy.' ' The chances
are that Dubois. will know no more of this
affair than a strangerâ beyond what I
have told him; and if he's a man of honor
he's bound to do the best he can for me
as his employer. Hav* you seen - the
Comte de Ribaumont?"
"Yes; and h* had heard nothing;. But
that fiend Ipanoff has mad* mischief be
tween US." â¢Â£!
And I told Noel Brent all that had
passed between me and the Russian. I
told him, too. how. I had given the dia
monds so mysteriously recovered to Max
ime, with the understanding that he was
not to open the bag which contained them
until he reached home.
"Jove!" ejaculated NoeL "What . an

"You could not** I admitted. "Nothlnf

2I had put the thought from me and dis
claimed It to Noel Brent; yet I knew,
deep down In my heart, that this was
what I had feared ever since Noel had
denied having both the treaty and the
diamonds: this-t hat-that Ipanoff's own
agent, not the police, had stolen the docu

I know that I am not a coward; yet it
was only by the strongest effort of will
that I forced myself to open It. Whenâ

.' My heart eprang to my throat at the
: w0rds. Never before had I forgotten an

I had forgotten. Desperate perplexity and
nerve-killing excitement had driven the
recollection from my mind. I could feel
'the blocd rush up to my face, then ebb
;away again, and I knew that Maxime saw
the change with surprise â for, unlike most
'actresses 1 , I wear no "make-up" on the
etage: I think it destroys expression, and
my complexion bears the glare of the
footlights well.
Â¦ "Had you forgotten?" Inquired Maxime,
reproachfully.

Â¦be impossible for me to keep my prom

lor the Judas that -I was.'
For years I had been a political spyâ
yeÂ«. But I owed a grudge to Franc* and
Russia, which I had promised my father
to pay. And besides, it is different to de
Â«he a country from what it Is to de
ceive the man you adore. We women are
true to Individuals. For them we would
all sacrifice a cause; and never had I suf
fered Buch acute torture as I did at that
moment in the shameful thought that
Maxime de RJbaumontâ honorable, noble
cherished In me a traitor; that even If
*uin did not overwhelm us, nothingâ noth
ing on earth could wash the stain from
the heart he believed to be pure.
He bowed acquiescence and moved back,
that the groom might receive his instruc
tions; and five minutes later he was sit
ting in the brougham beside me, with
Agnes seated opposite.
"Now," I began, : abruptly, in Russian,
cutting short bis fulsome praises of my
acting, "what have you to say. to me?"
I was determined to stand cautiously on
the defensive, letting each decisive move
be made by the adversary. "My maid
speaks only French." -.-_ ' .
"Why are -you bo cruelly, harsh?" he
exclaimed. "How have* I ever offended
"I will stop for you at the corner of the
Rue Boulanger: it would not do, as you
must know, for me to take you In here,"
I whispered, hurriedly. â¢ .. Â¦Â¦',
I was veiled, and I did not turn my eyes
to the right or left as I walked from the
stage door to the brougham, which, as I
had expected, was in its place. It was
not for me to look about for Ipanoff: It
was for him to be awaiting me, and so it
fell out As my groom opened the door
for me. the Russian stepped forward with
a "Good evening, mademoiselle," softly
pronounced in his hated voice.
My brougham would be waiting for me.
I knew, and my plan, was to speak to
Ipanoff. and then take him up a little
later, allowing him to drive with me and
Agnes, who always accompanied < ma
home. We would talk, together In Rus
sian, of which Agnes did not understand
a word; but her presence would be. a pro
tection, and, In case Ipanoff dared to ex
ceed the limits of my forbearance, I had
but to press an electric button close to
my hand for the carriage to be stopped
and the English groom (a stout fellow
and devoted to me) to appear at the win
dow.
"That is more easily promised than
some other things," said Maxime, smil
ing. "And I thank you a thousand times
in advance. Shall I tell you *hat I hope I
Ehall find?â the miniature of yourself In
a frame, and with a chain to hand round
my neck over my heart, such as you have
eaid you would give me some day. It
feels like that in my hand." As he spoke
he thrust the little bag with Its precious
contents into an Inside pocket of his coat.
Then there was nothing more for him to
say except the good-night which I was
waiting forâ hating, yet longing to hear.
When he was gone I made Agnes hurry
me out of the gold and white brocade of
Helolse. and into my own inconspicu
ous black dress and cloak which 1 had
worn to call az>on Noel Brent at the
Elysee Palace Hotel. Already it was half
past 11, and I had to see Count Ipanoff
and reach my own house by midnight. In
time to receive Noel. I was thankful that
Maxime's unselfish and trusting love for
me had rendered him for once .bo easy to
manage, and I could only hope that no
prying person might witness my meeting
with the Russian to make mischief \a the
future. ''.-9. t . -w ~'>
I went quickly, as I finished speaking,
from the . boudoir to â¢ the dressing-room,
where Agnes was putting away my things
for the night She never leaves the room
when I am out of it. lor she is a dragon
in guarding my jewels, which are pretty If
not very valuable. To-night the famous
necklace was in the box with such of my
own things as I had not sold or pawned
for Maxime. I had left the queer red
leather case with Noel Brent, and brought
the diamonds away with me in my
pocket; but as soon as I reached the thea
ter, unseen by Agnes, I had slipped the
necklace into a little embroidered eilk bag
in which I sometimes carried a purse and
handkerchief. This I had thrust into. the
jewel-box, eo that unconsciously my maid
was guarding 600,000 francs' worth of dia
monds, not counting my few trifles.
Earlier In the evening I meant before
leaving the theater to give the necklace
to Maxime and enjoy his surprise and re
lief at the sight of it. But now I had
changed my mind. It was necessary to
get rid ef Maxime (hateful as those words
sound in connection with one so dearly
loved) aa soon as possible, lest he and
Count Ipanoff should meet and Maxime
entirely misunderstand the nature of my
appointments with the latter. "Besides, I
was unprepared with an answer for the
questions Maxime was certain to ask me
In connection with the mysterious recov
ery of the diamonds. After having talked
with Noel Brent everything might be dif
ferent, and at all events I should know
better what to say.
With this resolve. I took the embroi
dered bag from my jewel-box and gave It
with Its ribbons tightly knotted, to Max
ime. "This holds something which you
will think precious," I announced, "par
ticularly as I have been at some trouble
to get it for you. So, for my sake, don't
open the bag to see what Is Inside until
you are at home In your bedroom with
the door locked."
"Only that I think I love you more
than I ever did before, andâ I suppoie It's
the fault of that last sceneâ I have a
wretched, inexplicable sense of impend
ing lots."
The words had a specially sharp edge
for meâ one that he did not dream of
giving. But I dared not let him see how
they pierced me. "It will be all the
eweeter to meet to-morrow." I assured
him. "Promise me that you will ge
straight home and dream of me as I shall
of you. Then to-morrow before you begin
the day's work stop and see me. I shall
be up and ready to receive you, no mat
ter how early It may be. But now, to
reward you for being good, I have some
thing for youâ something that you will
like very much."
"Don't think that X do not want yon to
be with me," I said.' "I d* want youâ
oh, more than you can guess! But I am
so tiredâ I am almost 11L When I asked
you to have supper with me I did not
realize how utterly worn out I was."
"My dearest!" he exclaimed. "Then X
will not be selfish. You will go home and
straight to bed. But you will let mo
drive with you to the door?"
"Even to that I must say no," X In
sisted, miserably, straining every nerve
to be plausible, to convince him of my
wisdom, and not to pain him too much.
"You see," I went on. "I did not mean,
evea whea I first asked you to suppe*
to let you drive home with me from th*
theater. We are engaged to be married*
and If people knew that they would be
disarmed, for aa actress may do, many
things which a woman ef society could
not do without scandal But they do not
know and must not know quite yet,
therefore I must be prudent I must not
appear to grant you favors which I will
-not grant to others; and I have never re
ceived any other man alone after the the
ater. You should be glad that this Is
true."
"Of course I am glad and proud," said
Maxime. "But It's horribly hard to see
no more of youâ to-night of all nights."
"Why to-night of all nights?" I was
suspicious in my guilty cowardice again.

stage, and been resurrected Into the wo

Ing problems had to be solved at once.
First there was Maxime to be put off
and pacifiedâ Maxime, whose help and
loving protection I needed so much, yet
must deny myself, and hurt him Instead.
He wa* waiting for me again at th*
door of my boudoir, and I had at least
one thing to be thankful forâ I had denied
myself to everybody else, refusing all In
vitations for the evening after th* thea

passionately; but his face was pal* and
aad. and my coward conscience gave m*
a quick stab of fear.
"What Is the matter?" I asked, whll*
Inside my head there was a shrieking
question! "What If the news had come
to him? What If already something has
happenedâ the beginning of the end?"
X could have cried with the snapping of
the tension when he answered: "It was
only that terrible sceneâ your death, as
Helolse, my dear one. It was so horribly
real. It was all X could. do to sit still In
the box and bear It I wanted to spring

doorâ the one leading into the entrance
hall.
. "Mademoiselle." he quietly announced,
'.'somebody knocks. Is it that you left the
gate unlocked? -And am I to admit any
one?". f.r-.'l';- '^-V-'i : Â¦
"Don't stand there arguing and advis
ing!" I cut in. In a fierce whisper. "He's
knocking again for the third time. Go
goâgo!" .
"I daren't. I'd forbidden him to come
here. I told him I was ill. and must go
straight to bed. He saw me with Count
Ipanoff, and now. if he finds you with
me what wilt he think? Yet the door
must be answered. Listen to that knock
ing! I can't' send him away. Hide your
self!âquickly, quicklyâ and I'll have
Henri let him In. Oh why do you delay?
Go into the next room. You can get out
through the window and leave the house
while Maxime and I are talking;."
"I'll do what you wish," said Noel. "But
I beg of you take my advice, and don't
attempt to deceive him. Better let
mÂ» â " â¢ ,
"Let him in, and tell him that I came
to see you on important business from a
friend in England, which could not await
till to-morrow."
As I spoke there came a knock at the
front door. Maxime's knock, I was cer
tain. I grew giddy, and my presence of
mind deserted me* " If only Noel had
come when he promised by this time he
would have been gone: but now I knew
not what to do for the best. I had suf
fered to much that my power of prompt
decision seemed dead.
"It is Maxime, I know," X whispered.
"What is to be done?"
We were standing In the drawing-room,
and the silk curtains were drawn across
the big bow window, yet mechanically
my eyes turned to it, and my heart was
beating fast "What if it should be Max
ime?" I exclaimed.
"Hush!" I broke in. catching him by
the arm. "I heard a step outside on the
gravel. I forgot to lock the gate. Did
you do it?"
"No," he answered In a low voice.
"I was very sorry to be late." said NoeL
"Iâ met some friends at the hotel Just
as I, was leaving, and was obliged to say
a few words to them. Then, when I had
got into a cab the wretched hone fell
down, and I had to walk after all, as
there wasn't another In sight, and "
"If I had known he would be so late,"
I said, rather reproachfully, "I might
have allowed him to come home with me
for a few moments, but as It was I
dared not; for Maxlme's one fault is
Jealousy."
"Even if Dubols . Is IpanofTs friend.**
said Noel, "it Isn't likely that the Rus
sian would be fool enough to confide his
designs against you to any one, no mat
ter how great the intimacy.' ' The chances
are that Dubois. will know no more of this
affair than a strangerâ beyond what I
have told him; and if he's a man of honor

Comte de Ribaumont?"
"Yes; and h* had heard nothing;. But

And I told Noel Brent all that had
passed between me and the Russian. I
told him, too. how. I had given the dia
monds so mysteriously recovered to Max
ime, with the understanding that he was
not to open the bag which contained them
until he reached home.

no man has been with you since, why did
I see you at the gate, opening It your
6clf, and admitting a man?"
I wonder that I kept myself from faint
ing. He had seen that, and waited all
this time to spring the mine upon me?
There was nothing else to do. I Instant
ly determined to deny it. and at every
hazard stand by my own falsehood.
"You could not have seen that,
Maxlme." I eaid. very slowly and quiet
ly, though my lips would scarcely form
the words, "because it did not happen.
Tell me exactly what you think you did
eee. and then we shall, perhaps, be able
to fathom the seeming mystery together.
Meanwhile, I ask you to give me at least
the benefit of the doubt You arrived at
this house. You stood near the pate, in
the street Is It not so? Well, what
then?"
"It Is so." Maxlme confessed. "I had
to come. I could not keep away. I was
on thÂ« othfr side of the street, for I did
not let my cab set me down before your
house. I got out and walked a short dis
tance, on the darker side. Just as I came
to a standstill, or a minute later, a man
came along, walking very fast I could
not see his face, or even recognize his fig
ure, but he was tall and well built. It
might have been Ipanoff, though ho
seemed to me slenderer. He rang the bell
ânot very loudly-and with scarcely any
delay the gate was opened for himâ
opened so wide that I distinctly saw a
woman's form 6ilhouetted against the
light which streamed from the entrance
hall of the house, thirty feet away."
"A woman's form!" I caught him up
quickly. "And are there no other women
in this house but its mistress? vDId it not
occur to you that I have a maid, who is
young and pretty, and human enough
for a flirtation?"
The blood rushed up to Maxlme's fore
bead. "I confess that I thought only of
you," he said.
"That is scarcely flattering, since you
thought of me only to doubt me."
"Then it was not you I saw at the gate?
You did not open it and let some one In
a Quarter of an hour ago?"
"If you were so sure It was I why did
you not try to prove your theory, right
or wrong, by following the man you
thought you saw me admit?" (It was
sheer bravado to ask this question; but
bravado was my line of defense.)
"I was on the opposite side of the
street and the gate was quickly shut
Btill I would have crossed and tried the
lock If there had been no one near. There
was, howe\'er. a coupe in the street,
which etopped in front of your gate.
There were two women In it, and they
appeared to be excitedly arguing some
question. While they were there I would
not attempt to enter, lest they were spies,
and you should be compromised. I wait
ed in the shadow until the coupe drove
out of the street then I tried the gate,
found It unlocked, and came in."
"To accuse me of sins against you which
I never dreamt of committing! Yet, if
you still believe me guilty, I know not
how to prove to you that I am Innocent
Blessed were they who believed with-
to resign myself to the knowledge that,
for Juliette's sake, I must be helpless.
And yet it was for her sake that I was
Impatient to be off.
My nerves prickled, an<L though it was
a cool night I grew as hot in this close,
airless room as if I had been in a Turk
ish bath. The sweat started out on my
face, and Irritably I searched for my
handkerchief, which I was accustomed to
wear tucked into my sleeve. It was not
there, and I felt In my coat pockets, find
ing It in a moment in one where I must
have thrust it in a fit of absentminded
ness. As I pulled it out something crisp
was crushed into the cambric folds by my
fingers; a small thing which to the. touch
was not unlike a creased bank note.
On this strange night of a strange day,
rothing in the least unexpected was to be
regarded as Insignificant. With a quick
thought of this, I did not let the crisp
thing fall to the floor, but with my left
hand separated it from the folds of my
handkerchief, and having secured it, ex
amined into its nature as well as I could
with the unaided sense of touch. As my
fingers still tested the rough edge of the
paper, I became aware that the excited
murmur of voices had ceased in the next
room. I even fancied that I had heard
the opening of a door.
For a moment I waited, and as the si
lence remained unbroken, I told myself
that Maxlme de Ribaumont 'had gone and
my chance had come at last Then fol
lowed a few seconds of Indecision, while
I debated the wisdom of lingering. In the
hope of a further explanation with Juli
ette; by the time one could have counted
twelve, however, I had made up my mind
to run no more risks of delay, but to get
out of the house while I could.
I pushed up the squeaking window sash
and dropped on to the grass, which, owing
to an Incline, was 6ix or eight feet be
low. Then I skirted round to the front
of the house, moving cautiously lest De
Ribaumont should not yet be out of the
grounds; and it was fortunate that I did
so, for as I came in sight of the front
door I saw It standing open and two fig
ures walking slowly along the path to
the gate, bending down as If searching for
something.
The two walked to the gate, opened It
passed out, and presently returned again.
I now had cause to be thankful that I
had not waited in the boudoir for Juliette
to come along and let me out for she and
her lover entered the house and closed the
door. As they moved up the steps which
led to it, I was not ten feet distant from
them In my hiding-place, and heard Ju
liette say aloud: "There Is witchcraft in
it " With that they passed into the house
and De Ribaumont's answer was lost to
me. I could not help wondering what it
was that they had searched for so eager
ly, and whether their quest were in any
strange way connected with the stolen
treaty; but as far as I was concerned
this last mystery must also remain un
solved, since the one course for me was
to put myself on the other side of the
high wall which shut in that garden as
soon as might be. Â¦
The gate was still unlocked lit had
probably been left so for De Ribaumont).
therefore I could walk out without leav-
to rejoice that our trouble was over at
last : . S:<:^^t-:l.
Gladly I would her* rone back to the
house in the Rue d'Anjou with toy news;
but as De Ribaumont was probably still
there, I was sure that. evÂ«n in the elr
cumstances, Juliette would thank me to
keep away. I determined to make all
speed to keep the offered appointment
with "H. J.," not returning to my hotel
until I had the treaty safe in my posses
sion. If the detective were there he must
wait or go, as he pleased. I could not
stop to consider him now, and perhaps
when the treaty was in my hands I
might risk calling Juliette up in the
small hours, for certainly there would
be no sleep for her to-night . .
I walked on through quiet street* for
so far without seeing an empty cab that
I gave up the Idea of looking for one at
all, absorbed in thinking over the affair
of the strangÂ© exchange which had been
made, and little dreaming what an amaz
ing difference In events the simple matter
of not taking a cab was to make.
The thli.s which bothered me most was
the effect likely to be produced upon "H.
J." when he discovered that I could not
hand him over the diamonds for the
treaty. Of course, I did not believe for
an instant his story about being a Jew
eler's messenger, though possiMy I might
have credited it had I not been acquaint
ed by Juliette with the history of the
diamonds and the loss. I had very little
doubt that the rat of a man who had be
trayed such panic terror in a railway
carriage was the expert thief who had
relieved Do Ribaumont of the Duches.se" s
necklace on the way to Amsterdam. Fol
lowing out the theory I thought It possi
ble that the fellow bad had confederates,
whom he contrived to dodge by traveling
to London with a view of cheating them of
their promised share In the spoil. Tri
umphant in the thought that he had put
them off the scent, yet too prudent to take
chances, he had reserved a first-class car
riage for himself as far as Dover; but,
after all, he had been followed by his ex
pals, who had provided themselves with a
railway key in case of the very emer
gency which had happened;, and If I had
not chanced to be late and forced my way
Into the same compartment "H. J.,
Juiller's Messenger," might have been
found murdered when the train reached
Dover.
All this was only deduction, of course,
as "H. J." did not explain the. nature of
the peril he so much meared. and so far
as I had seen, our two traveling com
panions had not even attempted to accost
him. Still, the theory accounted for
everything which had seemed mysterious
and made it plausible that a man should
risk the honesty of a stranger rather than
fall a victim to the revengeful greed of
those he knew too welL
I had resolved to put forth all my pow
ers of diplomacyâ my line of action to Be
more or less decided by "H. J.'s" method
of beginningâ when I arrived in the Rue
de la Tour, an ugly street of which one
of the least attractive houses was No.
117.
Not a light was to be seen, but a ring
at the bell had the effect of causing -a
liquid which lay. thick and greasy on the
surface of uncarpeted boards.
There seemed to be a good deal of It,
for as I felt my way along I still found
' the floor wet and slippery, and In the
: midst of the pool I stumbled against
something .heavy and soft. As. I struck
this object with my foot a queer thrill
went creeping through my veins, as If the
physical part of me had the first warn
ing of what was to come.
I stopped, and laid my hand on the
thing which had checked my progress
across the dark room. It was the body
of a man. and my searching fingers bad
descended upon his -. upturned face,
which, though not yet Icy cold to tfie
touch, was clammily chill: and wet with
the sticky fluid which smeared my fin
gers. . . ' . x . .
I had a sudden queer sensation as if
my heart had been squeezed hard and
then freed again, so that it gave a great
bound. I knew what the blackness hid
now, as well as If I had the eyes of a
cat to see In the dark. This thing that
I had touched was the body of a dead
man, and the blood his murderers had
made to flow, was on my fingers. Lit
erally I had walked to the discovery*
through blood; and though I have fought
as a volunteer and been acclimated to
horrors, the thought of what lay. before
me unseen turned me sick.; .
I km ashamed to say that my first Im
pulse was to get away as quickly as I
could, since I was not directly* concerned
in this . bad business, and spare myself
unnecessary dlsagreeableness. But the
prompting voice was bidding to be still
as soon as heard.
I . had got to concern myself In the
business, and duty , called upon me to
face a task almost 'as grim as could be
allotted to a man.
I could hear myself breathing hard as
I stood there rigidly upright in the dark
ness.
But instead of hurrying off to give the
alarm or disappear, leaving the secret of
the dark room to corns out in Its own time
and way, I must stay at my post until
I had discovered what was lost or given
up all hope of it
Setting my teeth to the task I avoided
the grim obstacle on the floor and got to
the mantelpiece. J There was a litter - mt
things on' it, pipes and bottles and other
miscellaneous debris, out of which I se
lected at last a small jar containing
matches. I struck one, and before turn
ing round, lighted an end of candle stuck
in its own grease on the mantelshelf.
Then I found the thing that had to be
faced.
It was what I thought, and it lay in the
midst of the Â¦ wildest confusion. I had
only missed catching sight of it and the
disorder of the, room in. the first flashing
glimpse afforded by, my own wax vesta
because of ' the large table covered with
a cloth which stood in the foreground
near the door | and . had formed a screen
for what lay between it and the stove on
the opposite Bide of the room.
There had . evidently been & struggle,
for chairs were' upset and the wretched
victim had apparently tried to escape by
running round the table, as the doth was
disarranged and a lamp was turned over
coat sleeve wen over It, consoling myself
with the. thought that after to-night I
need never see these clothes again.
Everywhere I looked among the scatter
ed papers on the floor, and at last I
could hardly restrain a cry of excitement
when I came upon my letter-case lying
half under a crumpled rug. When I had
snatched It up, however. It was only to
see it spread open and empty; but, fling
ing back the rug, my eyes lighted upon
a folded piece of parchment One glance
showed me its nature, and with a sigh
of lntensest relief I was about to thrust
It into the very pocket whence it had
been filched, when a groping noise outside
the door seemed to strike violently at
my consciousness like a box on the ear.
What was to come I knew not, but my
one thought at the instant was for the
treaty, so dearly reclaimed. I was kneel
ing on the floor, close to the stove, the
candle in one hand, the folded parchment
in the other. The aperture in the stove
front for regulating the draught was
open. Within was a gray blur of the dead
ashes. On a quick Impulse I thrust the
treaty through the hole as If I were post-
Ing a letter in a pillar-box, pushing it so
deeply that the cold ashes swallowed it
up. leaving no visible trace of its pres
ence. Then I turned my back to the
stove, thus facing the door as it opened. .

CHAPTER X.
A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.
I am not a bit nervous, as a rule, and
I should be ashamed to confess it if I had
ever been silly enough to Indulge in hys
terics; but I hadn't felt like myself since
that day, and, when Noel Brent went out
of the room at the Elysee Palace Hotel,
leaving us to sit down to our late supper,
the strangest feeling I ever had came
over me. It was Just as If he were going
out to meet some awful danger and some
thing was forcing me to call him back.
My blood seemed all going up to' my
head and drumming In my ears, then It
flowed back on my heart; and Instead of
being warm, healthy blood any more, it
turned to cold, heavy lead; and I felt sick
and faint and was seized with the most
unaccountable desire to burst out crying.
"Why, Margot, what is the matter7"
exclaimed my cousin, Marlon Bltgreaves.
And I did think It would have been more
tactful of her not to call every one's at
tention to me, if I looked odd. But I sup
pose she didn't stop to think.
I had to struggle to control myself, just
as I've struggled sometimes with a
vicious or frightened horse when riding,
and I managed to speak In quite a decent,
natural sounding voice, though my lips
were quivering.
"Why, am I paler* I asked. And I
laughed a little.
"You're awfully white," Captain Men
zies answered for her, looking at me as
if he were immensely concerned. It made
me so nervous I should have liked to say
something cross to him, but I didn't
"Poor child," said my dear, kind aunt.
Lady Gawain; "I'm afraid the rough
"Golng out?" I echoed In surprise
"Why, Marlon, you can't. ; Do you realize
it's after midnight?"
"I can't help that," said she. "I'd go
If it were the 'dark hour before dawn.' I
tell you I should die if I stayed Indoors.
Ob. don't be afraid that I mean to walk
the streets of Paris. I'm going to have a
closed carriageâ a coupeâ and drive and
drive till I feel better, if it's till dooms
day. The coupe's ordered already; they
won't say anything about It to our peo
ple. Of course, Lady Gawain would make
a fuss, she's so conventional."
"She isn't." I retorted, defending my
favorite aunt. "But any one would make
a fuss about such a plan. It's perfectly
mad. Don't go. Marlon. What you need
Is a draught to quiet your nerves."
"The air will quiet them better than
anything," she said, "and the bigness and
darkness of the night. I know myself
and what I need. I always was a sort of
changeling. Calm people like you don't
understand my moods."
Calm! If Marlon really thought* me
calm, either I must have better self-con
trol than I'd fancied, or she be less ob
servant.
By this time she was putting en her
hat. stabbing in the sparkling hatpins
viciously.
I had not taken mine off when we went
to supper, but I took up my Jacket,
which was hanging over a chair. "Very
well, you are older than I am, and your
own mistress." I said. "I can't prevent
you from doing what you choose. But if
you are determined to go for a drive se
cretly, in Paris after midnight. I shall go
with you. I'm sure that father would at
least approve of that."
I was afraid that Marion would object,
as she is often very > contrary, but she
didn't, and Judging from the expression
of her face, which was less tense and
drawn for a moment, one might even
have thought this was the thing she had
wished for.
"All Tight, come along." she said. "It
will do you a lot of good, Just as much as
It will me, if you only knew It."
"If Aunt Clem sees , us, of course she
won't let us stir a step." I remarked, at
the door.
"She won't see us," returned Marlon,
"They are all gobbling their supper as If
they hadn't eaten anything for a week."
This was very rude of her. but there
was no good in telling her so. and I said
nothing. . We went quietly down In the
lift, did not meet any of our party, and
we had not a minute to wait at the door
before a very nice coupe drove up, almost
a* private one.
What the hotel people thought of us I
don't know. Marion said that she had
made a perfectly good excuse, but I felt
so annoyed and nervous I wouldn't even
ask her what it had been.
She made me get in first, and gave some
directions to the coachman in rather a
low voice, so that I could not hear. I
didn't know whether she had done this on
purpose or not, but for awhile I wouldn't
give her the satisfaction of being uues
tioned. I sat leaning back against the
cushions, pretending to be perfectly in
different, and I don't think I did care
very much. After awhile, though, it be
pnn tn i!avn praHimllv ltnnn ttia that w.
out seeing, Maxlme."
"I do believe. I must believe!" he cried,
flinging himself on his knees at my feet.
With his lips on my hand my pulse gave
a leap, for in the next room I heard, or
fancied I heard, a sound. Noel Brent was
there still: and If Maxlme' s cars should
tell him what mine had told me I was
lost. I hastened to co\'er the sound by
rushing Into speech, saying the first thing
that sprang into my head. I had not
meant to mention the Duchess' necklace
again to-night, but. to my own surprise,
I heard myself speaking of it as though
the voice belonged to some one else.
"Then, if you believe in me, I will heap
coals of fire on your bead by permitting
you to look at the thing I save you in
the theaterâ looking at it now, without
waiting."
Still on his knees, Maxime thrust his
hand into the pocket where I bad seen
him place the little silk bag. His quick
obedience rose from a desire to please
me. I knew, rather than curiosity, for
there was no eagerness in his face, and
his eves were on mine, asking forgive-
ing suspicious traces or departure; and
my first idea was to go straight back
to my hotel, where Dubois might be wait
ing. But by the time I was out of the
Rue d'Anjou I had remembered the bit
of paper which I'd dragged from my
pocket with my handkerchief a short
time ago.
Curiosity prompted me to examine it
without delay: and in the next street I
stopped under a lamp and produced It
from my pocket again.
It was a leaf torn from a notebook, the
paper being almost as thin as that which
goes by the name of "Bible paptr." The
light was strong enough to show me that
the scrap was' covered on both sides with
small writing;, so evenly done as to sug
gest the work of a stylographic pen; but
I could not make out the tiny, cramped
words, liji'j
Here was a new stone in the amazing
puzzle-mosaic. Some one had slipped the
paper into my pocket without my knowl
edge! Why not the same somebody who
had put into another the case of dia
monds, and. presumably, removed the
crossing had upset you. though you
weren't 111 at the time. You're beginning
to feel it now. and I half repent making
you come. I know you didn't want to."
"Oh! yes, I did," I conventionally pro
tested, though I'm not sure whether I
was telling the truth or not. Perhaps,
after all. in my heart I had been a lit
tle glad of the excuse to come to Paris,
where Noel was to be with another
womanâ a woman he had vowed he
"wouldn't go across the street to see"â
though I shouldn't have confessed that
anything but good nature had brought me
If Marlon had asked. "I wanted to come
with you. of course. Aunt Clem, but I
certainly do feel queer; and If you won't
mind, I think I'd like to go up to my
room. I couldn't eat anything, andâ no,
please, I don't want any one to come up
with me. I'd rather be alone; and I know
I shall be all right In the morning."
"Very well, dear, you shan't be bother
ed," said Aunt Clem, who is an old love,
and always understands. But Captain
Menzies would go with me to the .lift,
and I really believe he was stupid enough
were not being driven aimlessly, but as
if with an object; and I remarked It to
Marion. "We seem to be going to some
place in particular, not Just driving about,
and we're driving fast," I said.
"I suddenly thought of a place it would
be Interesting to go to," Marlon replied,
with a kind of sharp dryness. "Oh. you
needn't look frightened; I don't mean to
go In, but only to watch the people mov
ing In and out."
- Her mood was to very queer that I
asked no more questions, and supposed
that she had told the coachman to drive
near some place of amusement which
closed very late; though why she should
be amused by watching the audience I
could not see, especially as she had said
her longing was for fresh air and great
dark spaces.
My knowledge of Paris Is mostly con
fined to the hotels, shops and theaters and
drives In the Bols de Boulogne: and Ma
rion's is exactly the same, as she has
never been to Paris without me, at all
events since she was a little child. I
thought she had made some mistake in
ness. But suddenly a look of blank
amazement dawned In them. "It's gone!"
Told by Noel Brent.
CHAPTER IX.
WHAT I FOUND AT THE HOUSE IN
THE RUE DE LA TOUR.
Never had I been caught in a situation
more repulsive than finding myself locked
Into Juliette de Nevers' boudoir^ iu the
hour after midnight, while In the next
room she assured her lover that no man
was there.
I had never been 1Â» the same bouse be
fore, end. In trying to discover another
door or a window in a dark room ab
solutely strange to me, I ran great risk
of betraying my presence by stumbling
against the furniture or knocking down
an ornament.
I dared not strike a match for fear of
the noise, and even If I could have found
an electric lamp and switched it on I
would not have. ventured to do so, lest
the light should be seen through the
crack of the locked door. -
Juliette, I knew well, was praying for
me to be out of the house, and I was
certainly far from wishing to linger.
I moved slowly, and with infinite cau
tion, despite the pressing need of haste,
and even so only saved myself over and
over again from upsetting one of those
useless little silver-loaded tables that
women loveâ a tall jar of flowers or a
light chair.
At last I found a window and believed
for a moment that the worst of my trou
bles was over, for the boudoir, being on
the ground floor, though rather high
above the level of the garden, I could
easily let myself down. But when I had
clipped In behind the heavy satin curtains
(which were drawn, as I had guessed) it
was only to encounter a new difficulty.
The window, unlike most windows in
France, was of the kind with sashes that
push up- and downr A careful servant
had doted and locked it for the night,
evidently not expecting the room to be
In use again; and when I had pressed
back the * fastening which held the two
sashes in place I discovered that the cord
which lifted the lower one was broken.
As the window was very large, each sash
containing one huge pane of plate-glass.
It could only be opened by the exertion
of considerable strength, and, as my first
cautious essay proved, also with a tell
tale squeaking noise that was not to be
avoided.
After one such rasping squeak I
stopped, my forehead growing damp at
the thought of the effect It might already
have produced in the adjoining room.
But after standing motionless for two or
three minutes I was convinced by the
continuance of the conversation beyond
the locked door that no harm had been
done. I then began a further tedious ex
amination of the walls, my only guide the
knife blade of yellow light under the door
through which I had been thrust itito this
place of darkness.
As I expected, the time occupied In the
Eearch was lost: and still the voices in
the next room talked on. Therefore I had
letter-case with the treaty? Keyed now
to a high pitch of excitement, I took out
my matchbox, lighted a wax vesta and
protecting the flame as well as I could,
proceeded to study the hanud writing.
"On Bord the Fome," were the three
ill-spelled words at the top of the first
page. And the Foam was the name of
the boat in which I had crossed the
Channel.
"I'm taking big: risks," were the next
words which I eagerly read, "but needs
must when one is drove to it. I am drove
to what I've Just done, for it's that or
worse. You saved my life and a lot more
to-day, though yem didn't know it, and
I'd bet my last qu&* that you're a gent'l
man and an honest man. I am a julller's
messenger, sir. trusted with a thing
worth many thousands, and from my first
start I knew I was in terrible danger.
Just before I seen you I thot I was done
for, but you saved me, and the only way
is to make you save me agen without
your knowing, for there's reesons why I
ean.'t epeak to you in private or make
sines. On this bote I'm safe, but when I
get to Paris it's worse than before, so
what I done was this: I'm a bit of a ven
trlloklst, and I throw my voise as if it
come from somewhere else on the gang
wax, so, making a disturbance, and in
that way by stumbling agenst you, I
managed to slip a cigar case. In which V I
carried valable Julls for my master, iir
your pocket. But, In t=o doing. I was
obliged to take out a case which you had
there, or you would at once have felt the
thickness, and pulled out what was there,
and then my fat would have bin in the
fire. Besides, you would have bin in
dainger, which was not fare. But hanged
if I'll look in your case, which may have
letters from your sweetheart for all I
know. You can have it agen by giving
me what you have of mine, which is fare
exchange. I can't call on you, for the
reeson I don't know ware you are going,
and dare not hang round to see on ac
count of the terible dainger I run.
"My hope Is to get as quick as I can
to a place where I expect to find a great
friend who will help me to keep it off,
and I must try to reach It without axi
dents. The best I can do is to slip this
note into your pocket like I did the julls,
and that I shall manage In the raleway
station, for I am clever in- those kind of
things. You see how I depend on you to
bring back my master's valable propetty,
like the gent'lman you are; and there
was no other way for me> I have no
time, to explane why. Come as soon as
you can when you have read this to the
back room on the left-hand side of the
passage, top floor. No. 117, Rue de la Ture,
Boolvard St. Michel. I'll be there all
right and I hope my friend; and there are
no words to.expres my gratltood in ad
vance.âYours trustingly, H. J., Juillers
Messenger. P. S.â for heaven's sake
don't fale. and ask the conserge for the
name of Polsson." *
"By Jove!" I Involuntarily exclaimed
aloud as I finished reading this extraor
dinary communication, and so furious
â¢was I at not having discovered it before,
thus saving desperate anxiety for Juliette
and myself, that I hardly remembered
Blight "click" that meant the opening of
the door. I passed Into a dim entrance,
to be challenged by a sleepy voice. pro
ceeding from the concierge's box. A head
showed itself behind the grating, and
monsieur the stranger was requested to
state which resident of- the house , he
wished to see at an hour so late.
I replied that my object was to call
upon Monsieur Polsson, who occupied the
back room at the left, on the top floor,
and if he were not at home I would con
tent myself with the society of his guest,
a gentleman from England who had ar
rived that night.
"Ah, yes, monsieur has been 'here be
fore already," remarked the sleepy con
cierge. "He now returns, as he said he
might do?"
I reflected for the fraction of a second,
then decided that It would be wise not
to correct this impression. It would be
simpler to let the man suppose me to be
this person with an evident right to ad
mittance, rather than run the risk of
Inquiries or a row. It is upon such trifles
as these that the issues of a life hang,
but It is a lesson never learned even by
experience.
"Quite right," I assured the. somnolent
guardian of the house, and pressed on up
the stairs, ascending flight after flight,
and meeting no one.
The upper story, which was the sixth,
was In darkness, though dim lights had
burned In the 'â¢ passage below. I had -to
resort once more to my wax vestas before
I could be quite sure of the door. When
I was sure I knocked, but there was no
answer.
I knocked again and for response had
only-silenceâ a silence that .got on my
nerves. I pounded once more, very hard,
and then when no sound from within fol
lowed I tried the door.
Somewhat to my surprise. It was not
locked. â¢ I opened it. , and crossed the
threshold, stepping from' darkness Into
darkness and smelling a strong odor of
paraffin. I lighted another vestaâ my last
âand had just time to peer about, gaining
a vague idea of the arrangement of a
bare, disorderly and shabby room, when a
draught of air, evidently from an open
window, blew out the little flame and
slammed the door which shut behind me
at the same instant.
My glance around had not .assured me
whether or no the room were occupied;
but if there were an occupant he must be
a sound sleeper not to have been
awakened by my entrance and the strik
ing of a match. I stood still and called
out in English: "Hullo! is any one here?"
No answer came, and I determined to
find my way as best I could to the man
tel, where I might hope to come across
some matches. .
I struck out for this landmark, but was
not sure whether I- kept my sense. of di
rection . clear or not a'fter. I ; had bumped
against a table, and something ' else,'
which proved to be a chair, turned over
on the bare floor. Once I caught my foot
In a rug which had got twis ted up in a
heap, and hardly had I extricated myself
from. this when I slipped and almost lost
my balance by stepping in tome spilled
in the center, the globe and chimney both
broken in pieces and the spilled oil giv
ing forth the strong odor Â¦ of paraffin
which I had detected on opening the door.
But the struggle for life did not account
for all the confusion. The pockets of the
murdered man had been pulled wrong
side out, his waistcoat had been torn
open, I showing the gay blue ' and pink
checked shirt- which I remembered no
ticing In the morning, deeply dyed now
with blood. Papers were scattered ever
the floor, some spotted red, some half
concealed under tangled rugs which had
been roughly kicked out of the way. The
drawers of an escritoire had been. jerked
" out and their contents thrown here and
there: a wardrobe stood wide open, and
various garments flung on the floor with
the pockets in the same condition as
those of the corpse. A chest of drawers
. had also' been ransacked in a fury of
haste, and even the cot-bed had been vio
lently dismantled. ...The whole, room
looked as if a whirlwind had swept
through it; and I, being in the dead man's
secret, needed no explanation of motive
for the deed that' had been done, or the
search which had followed. All the cun
ning of the. poor wretch, who- lay "with
glazed eyes staring up to the ceiling, . a
grin of terror on the lips from . which
. blood had oozed, had proved in vain. He
had saved the diamonds for another man
himself, and lost his life while triumphing
in the expedient that had preserved
them. The glimmer of the candle, which
I had dislodged from its saucer of grease
to hold in my hand, threw grotesque fllck
erings over, the ghastly .face, making the
features live again in a leer so.disquiet
ing that . I threw the - Illumination else
where, turning it by chance upon the
door, and discovering that the bolt which
evidently had fastened it hung half off.
This threw a light upon the past hour of
mystery, enabling me to reconstruct the
scene. , . â¢ Â¦ â¢
I imagined the arrival of the fugitive,
hoping, praying that he had succeeded in
. dodging his pursuers; his disappointment
in finding his friend away; bis precautions
against being disturbed; his ignorance of
the stealthy work being deftly done out
side the bolted door; his start at the sud
den, horrifying sound of Its opening; his
choked protests that he had not the Jew
els with him; his wild struggle to escape,
and thenâ the end.
' It was a hateful picture for the imagin
ation, so luridly vivid here on the spot
where the drama had been enacted that
I resolutely shut my eyes upon It and con
centrated my. thoughts on the work before
me. . '.')
The state of the room did not promise
much for my purpose, since the murderer
or murderers had gone ; through every
thing in their hunt for the diamonds;
- still, ; it was not Â¦ impossible \ that' In their
mad ; haste for the one thing, they had

â¢ I moved about the room with the flaring
candle: end,; avoiding the pool of ; blood
into which I'd blundered In the dark, and
' disgusted . at seeing the 'Â¦* horrid ' signs of
"contact on my feet and the hand .which
â¢, had .touched; the corpse." Even -ray shirt
; cuff was smeared; i but Â¦Â¦_ I ,. hid . the red
smudge from my own eyes by putting my
to murmur pretty things on the way,
though I heardly heard them.
I was thankful to be in my own room;
but when I was there I didn't begin to
undress, or even sit down to rest,
though I was still rather shaky. I went
to one of the windows, opened It wide,
and stood looking out. c ' -
Down there somewhere, under the sky
turned black by the electric lights that
glared up at It, was Noel Brent, who at
this very hour last night had been tell
ing me, at our dance, that he loved me
more than the whole worldâ that I was,
had been, and ever would be, the one
woman on earth for him. Here was I re
membering every. word he had said, hear
ing the very sound of his voice; down
there was he*, going to keep a midnight
appointment with that other woman, for
whose sake he had broken with me.
With what a strange sorcery she must
have bewitched him! I thought with a
sad bitterness. It was almost Impossible
not to believe that he had meant what he
looked and said last night; yet a few
hours later at a call from her he forgot
me, enmeshed by the old fascination. The
only grace left in him now had caused
him to flush and stammer a little as un
der my eyes he refused Lord Gawain's
invitation to stop with us, making an an
nouncement of a prior engagement, which
he must have known to my ears virtually
amounted to a confession.
I was still at the window when at the
door between my room and the next I
heard a knocking, which was accompa
nied by the voice of Marlon.
"Dearest, please let me in," she said. "I
want very much to see you." .-.Â¦â¢'
Now, I had never liked Marion less in
my life than I had to-day, though really
I think she bad meant to serve me. But
always when she has irritated me, and I
have, nearly been cross, I feel so remorse
ful that I try to be nicer to her than be
fore, for I am very sorry for Marion, who
Is not quite like other girls In her looks,
and Is besides so delicate that almost
anything she does ought to be excusable.
I didn't want at all to see her, but I
went to the door/ which separated her
room from mine and let her in.
She thanked me and flung herself down
on a sofa. "I don't feel very well, either,"
she said, "and I couldn't eat, so I thought
I. would come upstairs too." With this she
Jumped off the sofa and began walking up
and down. "I'm so restless I feel as if I
should die," she exclaimed. "It's just as if
the air were full of electricity. Don't you
feel it so?"
"Yes, I do." I answered. "I suppose it's
the change." - : vi j
"No," said Marion, looking' eerie and
haggard as a witch. "It's because some
thing's going to happen."
This was really, curious, for it appeared
that she had exactly the sensation I was
trying to control.
'.'I'm superstitious," she went on; "more
so to-night than I ever was. . It's just as
if a voice were calling meâ somewhere;
and I'd got to obey it I know now how
the sailors felt when the sirens _ lured
them. Do you guess why I came to your
room? It was because when we washed
our. faces before going In to supper I left
my hat here. I'm going out, Margot."
giving her orders to the cabman, there
fore, when at last he drew up In a dull
little street, with hardly a light In any of
the houses, and began to walk his horse
very slowly.
"What are we doinsr here?" I exclaimed.
"This Is where I want to see the Inter
esting people go In and out." said Ma
rlon, In a defiant sort of way.
"Why. what street is It?" I asked.
' "It is the Rue d'Anjou." she answered,
but the name suggested nothing to me.
"I don't think it looks very promising,"
said I.
â¢ "Don't you? Walt a few minute* and
you may change your mind. Ah I " she
thrust her head from the window with a
whispered ejaculation of such excitement
that I peered curiously over her shoulder.
A closed carriage was driving into the
street. It stopped before a gate set In an
ugly high wall, and our coupe was in
such a position on the opposite elde of
the way that we could see a groom Jump
down, open the door and help a woman in
a long white evening coat to get out.
The street was rather dark, but there
was enough light from a lamp near by to
give us a glimpse of a beautiful profile
and shining waves of heavy auburn hair.
I drew back as if I had been struck*
"Marlon," I exclaimed, "what does this
mean? That was Juliette de Nevers!"
"Yes. that Is her house. I read an In
terview with her in a paper not long ago
which spoke about It and described it. I
remembered the name of the street." an
swered Marlon, as calmly as If she had
been talking of the weather.
Her manner and the trick she had
played upon me made me so angry that
my heart beat very fast and my breatS
came quickly.
"I don't know why you earn* here," X
said; "but I do know that I'm not going
to stay another momentâ spying upon a
person whose movements can't possibly
concern me."
Suddenly, to my surprise, from being
defiant Marion became pleading. "Oh,
Margot darling," . she implored, "for my
sake and your own rake don't go. It is
entirely for you that I came, but I dared
not let you guess what was In my mind,
for I knew you wouldn't listen to my
persuasions. All day I have been feeling
horribly guilty lest It was my fault that
you were giving up Noel Brent. I did
what I thought right this morning, and
I still believe it was right. But suppose
it were all a plot of Juliette de Never*
to get Noel away from youâ how should
I feel if I ever found out I had been play
ing into her hands and spoiled your lifer*
"You need not reproach yourself," I
said. "I* heard all that was necessary
from his own lips at Charing Cross."
"But if there were a misunderstanding
and he was' too honorable to defend him
self at that woman's expense? One never
can be quite sure till one* sees with one's
own eyes. He may merely have seen her
at the theaterâ perhaps, bound by a prom
ise which he'd forgotten, till she remind
ed him of it. It may be all over and done
with now. Very likely that appointment
he spoke of at the hotel was not with
her. Can't you understand how my part
in this affair has been on my conscience?

no man has been with you since, why did
I see you at the gate, opening It your
6clf, and admitting a man?"
I wonder that I kept myself from faint
ing. He had seen that, and waited all
this time to spring the mine upon me?
There was nothing else to do. I Instant
ly determined to deny it. and at every
hazard stand by my own falsehood.
"You could not have seen that,
Maxlme." I eaid. very slowly and quiet
ly, though my lips would scarcely form
the words, "because it did not happen.
Tell me exactly what you think you did
eee. and then we shall, perhaps, be able
to fathom the seeming mystery together.
Meanwhile, I ask you to give me at least
the benefit of the doubt You arrived at
this house. You stood near the pate, in
the street Is It not so? Well, what
then?"
"It Is so." Maxlme confessed. "I had
to come. I could not keep away. I was
on thÂ« othfr side of the street, for I did
not let my cab set me down before your
house. I got out and walked a short dis
tance, on the darker side. Just as I came
to a standstill, or a minute later, a man
came along, walking very fast I could
not see his face, or even recognize his fig
ure, but he was tall and well built. It
might have been Ipanoff, though ho
seemed to me slenderer. He rang the bell
ânot very loudly-and with scarcely any
delay the gate was opened for himâ
opened so wide that I distinctly saw a
woman's form 6ilhouetted against the
light which streamed from the entrance
hall of the house, thirty feet away."
"A woman's form!" I caught him up
quickly. "And are there no other women
in this house but its mistress? vDId it not
occur to you that I have a maid, who is
young and pretty, and human enough
for a flirtation?"
The blood rushed up to Maxlme's fore
bead. "I confess that I thought only of
you," he said.
"That is scarcely flattering, since you
thought of me only to doubt me."
"Then it was not you I saw at the gate?
You did not open it and let some one In
a Quarter of an hour ago?"
"If you were so sure It was I why did
you not try to prove your theory, right
or wrong, by following the man you
thought you saw me admit?" (It was
sheer bravado to ask this question; but
bravado was my line of defense.)
"I was on the opposite side of the
street and the gate was quickly shut
Btill I would have crossed and tried the
lock If there had been no one near. There
was, howe\'er. a coupe in the street,
which etopped in front of your gate.
There were two women In it, and they
appeared to be excitedly arguing some
question. While they were there I would
not attempt to enter, lest they were spies,
and you should be compromised. I wait
ed in the shadow until the coupe drove
out of the street then I tried the gate,
found It unlocked, and came in."
"To accuse me of sins against you which
I never dreamt of committing! Yet, if
you still believe me guilty, I know not
how to prove to you that I am Innocent
Blessed were they who believed with-
to resign myself to the knowledge that,
for Juliette's sake, I must be helpless.
And yet it was for her sake that I was
Impatient to be off.
My nerves prickled, an<L though it was
a cool night I grew as hot in this close,
airless room as if I had been in a Turk
ish bath. The sweat started out on my
face, and Irritably I searched for my
handkerchief, which I was accustomed to
wear tucked into my sleeve. It was not
there, and I felt In my coat pockets, find
ing It in a moment in one where I must
have thrust it in a fit of absentminded
ness. As I pulled it out something crisp
was crushed into the cambric folds by my
fingers; a small thing which to the. touch
was not unlike a creased bank note.
On this strange night of a strange day,
rothing in the least unexpected was to be
regarded as Insignificant. With a quick
thought of this, I did not let the crisp
thing fall to the floor, but with my left
hand separated it from the folds of my
handkerchief, and having secured it, ex
amined into its nature as well as I could
with the unaided sense of touch. As my
fingers still tested the rough edge of the
paper, I became aware that the excited
murmur of voices had ceased in the next
room. I even fancied that I had heard
the opening of a door.
For a moment I waited, and as the si
lence remained unbroken, I told myself
that Maxlme de Ribaumont 'had gone and
my chance had come at last Then fol
lowed a few seconds of Indecision, while
I debated the wisdom of lingering. In the
hope of a further explanation with Juli
ette; by the time one could have counted
twelve, however, I had made up my mind
to run no more risks of delay, but to get
out of the house while I could.
I pushed up the squeaking window sash
and dropped on to the grass, which, owing
to an Incline, was 6ix or eight feet be
low. Then I skirted round to the front
of the house, moving cautiously lest De
Ribaumont should not yet be out of the
grounds; and it was fortunate that I did
so, for as I came in sight of the front
door I saw It standing open and two fig
ures walking slowly along the path to
the gate, bending down as If searching for
something.
The two walked to the gate, opened It
passed out, and presently returned again.
I now had cause to be thankful that I
had not waited in the boudoir for Juliette
to come along and let me out for she and
her lover entered the house and closed the
door. As they moved up the steps which
led to it, I was not ten feet distant from
them In my hiding-place, and heard Ju
liette say aloud: "There Is witchcraft in
it " With that they passed into the house
and De Ribaumont's answer was lost to
me. I could not help wondering what it
was that they had searched for so eager
ly, and whether their quest were in any
strange way connected with the stolen
treaty; but as far as I was concerned
this last mystery must also remain un
solved, since the one course for me was
to put myself on the other side of the
high wall which shut in that garden as
soon as might be. Â¦
The gate was still unlocked lit had
probably been left so for De Ribaumont).
therefore I could walk out without leav-
to rejoice that our trouble was over at
last : . S:<:^^t-:l.
Gladly I would her* rone back to the
house in the Rue d'Anjou with toy news;
but as De Ribaumont was probably still
there, I was sure that. evÂ«n in the elr
cumstances, Juliette would thank me to
keep away. I determined to make all
speed to keep the offered appointment
with "H. J.," not returning to my hotel
until I had the treaty safe in my posses
sion. If the detective were there he must
wait or go, as he pleased. I could not
stop to consider him now, and perhaps
when the treaty was in my hands I
might risk calling Juliette up in the
small hours, for certainly there would
be no sleep for her to-night . .
I walked on through quiet street* for
so far without seeing an empty cab that
I gave up the Idea of looking for one at
all, absorbed in thinking over the affair
of the strangÂ© exchange which had been
made, and little dreaming what an amaz
ing difference In events the simple matter
of not taking a cab was to make.
The thli.s which bothered me most was
the effect likely to be produced upon "H.
J." when he discovered that I could not
hand him over the diamonds for the
treaty. Of course, I did not believe for
an instant his story about being a Jew
eler's messenger, though possiMy I might
have credited it had I not been acquaint
ed by Juliette with the history of the
diamonds and the loss. I had very little
doubt that the rat of a man who had be
trayed such panic terror in a railway
carriage was the expert thief who had
relieved Do Ribaumont of the Duches.se" s
necklace on the way to Amsterdam. Fol
lowing out the theory I thought It possi
ble that the fellow bad had confederates,
whom he contrived to dodge by traveling
to London with a view of cheating them of
their promised share In the spoil. Tri
umphant in the thought that he had put
them off the scent, yet too prudent to take
chances, he had reserved a first-class car
riage for himself as far as Dover; but,
after all, he had been followed by his ex
pals, who had provided themselves with a
railway key in case of the very emer
gency which had happened;, and If I had
not chanced to be late and forced my way
Into the same compartment "H. J.,
Juiller's Messenger," might have been
found murdered when the train reached
Dover.
All this was only deduction, of course,
as "H. J." did not explain the. nature of
the peril he so much meared. and so far
as I had seen, our two traveling com
panions had not even attempted to accost
him. Still, the theory accounted for
everything which had seemed mysterious
and made it plausible that a man should
risk the honesty of a stranger rather than
fall a victim to the revengeful greed of
those he knew too welL
I had resolved to put forth all my pow
ers of diplomacyâ my line of action to Be
more or less decided by "H. J.'s" method
of beginningâ when I arrived in the Rue
de la Tour, an ugly street of which one
of the least attractive houses was No.
117.
Not a light was to be seen, but a ring
at the bell had the effect of causing -a
liquid which lay. thick and greasy on the
surface of uncarpeted boards.
There seemed to be a good deal of It,
for as I felt my way along I still found
' the floor wet and slippery, and In the
: midst of the pool I stumbled against
something .heavy and soft. As. I struck
this object with my foot a queer thrill
went creeping through my veins, as If the
physical part of me had the first warn
ing of what was to come.
I stopped, and laid my hand on the
thing which had checked my progress
across the dark room. It was the body
of a man. and my searching fingers bad
descended upon his -. upturned face,
which, though not yet Icy cold to tfie
touch, was clammily chill: and wet with
the sticky fluid which smeared my fin
gers. . . ' . x . .
I had a sudden queer sensation as if
my heart had been squeezed hard and
then freed again, so that it gave a great
bound. I knew what the blackness hid
now, as well as If I had the eyes of a
cat to see In the dark. This thing that
I had touched was the body of a dead
man, and the blood his murderers had
made to flow, was on my fingers. Lit
erally I had walked to the discovery*
through blood; and though I have fought
as a volunteer and been acclimated to
horrors, the thought of what lay. before
me unseen turned me sick.; .
I km ashamed to say that my first Im
pulse was to get away as quickly as I
could, since I was not directly* concerned
in this . bad business, and spare myself
unnecessary dlsagreeableness. But the
prompting voice was bidding to be still
as soon as heard.
I . had got to concern myself In the
business, and duty , called upon me to
face a task almost 'as grim as could be
allotted to a man.
I could hear myself breathing hard as
I stood there rigidly upright in the dark
ness.
But instead of hurrying off to give the
alarm or disappear, leaving the secret of
the dark room to corns out in Its own time
and way, I must stay at my post until
I had discovered what was lost or given
up all hope of it
Setting my teeth to the task I avoided
the grim obstacle on the floor and got to
the mantelpiece. J There was a litter - mt
things on' it, pipes and bottles and other
miscellaneous debris, out of which I se
lected at last a small jar containing
matches. I struck one, and before turn
ing round, lighted an end of candle stuck
in its own grease on the mantelshelf.
Then I found the thing that had to be
faced.
It was what I thought, and it lay in the
midst of the Â¦ wildest confusion. I had
only missed catching sight of it and the
disorder of the, room in. the first flashing
glimpse afforded by, my own wax vesta
because of ' the large table covered with
a cloth which stood in the foreground
near the door | and . had formed a screen
for what lay between it and the stove on
the opposite Bide of the room.
There had . evidently been & struggle,
for chairs were' upset and the wretched
victim had apparently tried to escape by
running round the table, as the doth was
disarranged and a lamp was turned over
coat sleeve wen over It, consoling myself
with the. thought that after to-night I
need never see these clothes again.
Everywhere I looked among the scatter
ed papers on the floor, and at last I
could hardly restrain a cry of excitement
when I came upon my letter-case lying
half under a crumpled rug. When I had
snatched It up, however. It was only to
see it spread open and empty; but, fling
ing back the rug, my eyes lighted upon
a folded piece of parchment One glance
showed me its nature, and with a sigh
of lntensest relief I was about to thrust
It into the very pocket whence it had
been filched, when a groping noise outside
the door seemed to strike violently at
my consciousness like a box on the ear.
What was to come I knew not, but my
one thought at the instant was for the
treaty, so dearly reclaimed. I was kneel
ing on the floor, close to the stove, the
candle in one hand, the folded parchment
in the other. The aperture in the stove
front for regulating the draught was
open. Within was a gray blur of the dead
ashes. On a quick Impulse I thrust the
treaty through the hole as If I were post-
Ing a letter in a pillar-box, pushing it so
deeply that the cold ashes swallowed it
up. leaving no visible trace of its pres
ence. Then I turned my back to the
stove, thus facing the door as it opened. .

CHAPTER X.
A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.
I am not a bit nervous, as a rule, and
I should be ashamed to confess it if I had
ever been silly enough to Indulge in hys
terics; but I hadn't felt like myself since
that day, and, when Noel Brent went out
of the room at the Elysee Palace Hotel,
leaving us to sit down to our late supper,
the strangest feeling I ever had came
over me. It was Just as If he were going
out to meet some awful danger and some
thing was forcing me to call him back.
My blood seemed all going up to' my
head and drumming In my ears, then It
flowed back on my heart; and Instead of
being warm, healthy blood any more, it
turned to cold, heavy lead; and I felt sick
and faint and was seized with the most
unaccountable desire to burst out crying.
"Why, Margot, what is the matter7"
exclaimed my cousin, Marlon Bltgreaves.
And I did think It would have been more
tactful of her not to call every one's at
tention to me, if I looked odd. But I sup
pose she didn't stop to think.
I had to struggle to control myself, just
as I've struggled sometimes with a
vicious or frightened horse when riding,
and I managed to speak In quite a decent,
natural sounding voice, though my lips
were quivering.
"Why, am I paler* I asked. And I
laughed a little.
"You're awfully white," Captain Men
zies answered for her, looking at me as
if he were immensely concerned. It made
me so nervous I should have liked to say
something cross to him, but I didn't
"Poor child," said my dear, kind aunt.
Lady Gawain; "I'm afraid the rough
"Golng out?" I echoed In surprise
"Why, Marlon, you can't. ; Do you realize
it's after midnight?"
"I can't help that," said she. "I'd go
If it were the 'dark hour before dawn.' I
tell you I should die if I stayed Indoors.
Ob. don't be afraid that I mean to walk
the streets of Paris. I'm going to have a
closed carriageâ a coupeâ and drive and
drive till I feel better, if it's till dooms
day. The coupe's ordered already; they
won't say anything about It to our peo
ple. Of course, Lady Gawain would make
a fuss, she's so conventional."
"She isn't." I retorted, defending my
favorite aunt. "But any one would make
a fuss about such a plan. It's perfectly
mad. Don't go. Marlon. What you need
Is a draught to quiet your nerves."
"The air will quiet them better than
anything," she said, "and the bigness and
darkness of the night. I know myself
and what I need. I always was a sort of
changeling. Calm people like you don't
understand my moods."
Calm! If Marlon really thought* me
calm, either I must have better self-con
trol than I'd fancied, or she be less ob
servant.
By this time she was putting en her
hat. stabbing in the sparkling hatpins
viciously.
I had not taken mine off when we went
to supper, but I took up my Jacket,
which was hanging over a chair. "Very
well, you are older than I am, and your
own mistress." I said. "I can't prevent
you from doing what you choose. But if
you are determined to go for a drive se
cretly, in Paris after midnight. I shall go
with you. I'm sure that father would at
least approve of that."
I was afraid that Marion would object,
as she is often very > contrary, but she
didn't, and Judging from the expression
of her face, which was less tense and
drawn for a moment, one might even
have thought this was the thing she had
wished for.
"All Tight, come along." she said. "It
will do you a lot of good, Just as much as
It will me, if you only knew It."
"If Aunt Clem sees , us, of course she
won't let us stir a step." I remarked, at
the door.
"She won't see us," returned Marlon,
"They are all gobbling their supper as If
they hadn't eaten anything for a week."
This was very rude of her. but there
was no good in telling her so. and I said
nothing. . We went quietly down In the
lift, did not meet any of our party, and
we had not a minute to wait at the door
before a very nice coupe drove up, almost
a* private one.
What the hotel people thought of us I
don't know. Marion said that she had
made a perfectly good excuse, but I felt
so annoyed and nervous I wouldn't even
ask her what it had been.
She made me get in first, and gave some
directions to the coachman in rather a
low voice, so that I could not hear. I
didn't know whether she had done this on
purpose or not, but for awhile I wouldn't
give her the satisfaction of being uues
tioned. I sat leaning back against the
cushions, pretending to be perfectly in
different, and I don't think I did care
very much. After awhile, though, it be
pnn tn i!avn praHimllv ltnnn ttia that w.
out seeing, Maxlme."
"I do believe. I must believe!" he cried,
flinging himself on his knees at my feet.
With his lips on my hand my pulse gave
a leap, for in the next room I heard, or
fancied I heard, a sound. Noel Brent was
there still: and If Maxlme' s cars should
tell him what mine had told me I was
lost. I hastened to co\'er the sound by
rushing Into speech, saying the first thing
that sprang into my head. I had not
meant to mention the Duchess' necklace
again to-night, but. to my own surprise,
I heard myself speaking of it as though
the voice belonged to some one else.
"Then, if you believe in me, I will heap
coals of fire on your bead by permitting
you to look at the thing I save you in
the theaterâ looking at it now, without
waiting."
Still on his knees, Maxime thrust his
hand into the pocket where I bad seen
him place the little silk bag. His quick
obedience rose from a desire to please
me. I knew, rather than curiosity, for
there was no eagerness in his face, and
his eves were on mine, asking forgive-
ing suspicious traces or departure; and
my first idea was to go straight back
to my hotel, where Dubois might be wait
ing. But by the time I was out of the
Rue d'Anjou I had remembered the bit
of paper which I'd dragged from my
pocket with my handkerchief a short
time ago.
Curiosity prompted me to examine it
without delay: and in the next street I
stopped under a lamp and produced It
from my pocket again.
It was a leaf torn from a notebook, the
paper being almost as thin as that which
goes by the name of "Bible paptr." The
light was strong enough to show me that
the scrap was' covered on both sides with
small writing;, so evenly done as to sug
gest the work of a stylographic pen; but
I could not make out the tiny, cramped
words, liji'j
Here was a new stone in the amazing
puzzle-mosaic. Some one had slipped the
paper into my pocket without my knowl

weren't 111 at the time. You're beginning

"Oh! yes, I did," I conventionally pro
tested, though I'm not sure whether I
was telling the truth or not. Perhaps,
after all. in my heart I had been a lit
tle glad of the excuse to come to Paris,
where Noel was to be with another
womanâ a woman he had vowed he
"wouldn't go across the street to see"â
though I shouldn't have confessed that
anything but good nature had brought me
If Marlon had asked. "I wanted to come

certainly do feel queer; and If you won't

if with an object; and I remarked It to
Marion. "We seem to be going to some
place in particular, not Just driving about,
and we're driving fast," I said.
"I suddenly thought of a place it would
be Interesting to go to," Marlon replied,
with a kind of sharp dryness. "Oh. you
needn't look frightened; I don't mean to
go In, but only to watch the people mov
ing In and out."
- Her mood was to very queer that I
asked no more questions, and supposed
that she had told the coachman to drive
near some place of amusement which
closed very late; though why she should
be amused by watching the audience I
could not see, especially as she had said
her longing was for fresh air and great
dark spaces.
My knowledge of Paris Is mostly con
fined to the hotels, shops and theaters and
drives In the Bols de Boulogne: and Ma
rion's is exactly the same, as she has
never been to Paris without me, at all
events since she was a little child. I
thought she had made some mistake in
ness. But suddenly a look of blank
amazement dawned In them. "It's gone!"

CHAPTER IX.
WHAT I FOUND AT THE HOUSE IN
THE RUE DE LA TOUR.
Never had I been caught in a situation
more repulsive than finding myself locked
Into Juliette de Nevers' boudoir^ iu the
hour after midnight, while In the next
room she assured her lover that no man
was there.
I had never been 1Â» the same bouse be
fore, end. In trying to discover another
door or a window in a dark room ab
solutely strange to me, I ran great risk
of betraying my presence by stumbling
against the furniture or knocking down
an ornament.
I dared not strike a match for fear of
the noise, and even If I could have found
an electric lamp and switched it on I
would not have. ventured to do so, lest
the light should be seen through the
crack of the locked door. -
Juliette, I knew well, was praying for
me to be out of the house, and I was
certainly far from wishing to linger.
I moved slowly, and with infinite cau
tion, despite the pressing need of haste,
and even so only saved myself over and
over again from upsetting one of those
useless little silver-loaded tables that
women loveâ a tall jar of flowers or a
light chair.
At last I found a window and believed
for a moment that the worst of my trou
bles was over, for the boudoir, being on
the ground floor, though rather high
above the level of the garden, I could
easily let myself down. But when I had
clipped In behind the heavy satin curtains
(which were drawn, as I had guessed) it
was only to encounter a new difficulty.
The window, unlike most windows in
France, was of the kind with sashes that
push up- and downr A careful servant
had doted and locked it for the night,
evidently not expecting the room to be
In use again; and when I had pressed
back the * fastening which held the two
sashes in place I discovered that the cord
which lifted the lower one was broken.
As the window was very large, each sash
containing one huge pane of plate-glass.
It could only be opened by the exertion
of considerable strength, and, as my first
cautious essay proved, also with a tell
tale squeaking noise that was not to be
avoided.
After one such rasping squeak I
stopped, my forehead growing damp at
the thought of the effect It might already
have produced in the adjoining room.
But after standing motionless for two or
three minutes I was convinced by the
continuance of the conversation beyond
the locked door that no harm had been
done. I then began a further tedious ex
amination of the walls, my only guide the
knife blade of yellow light under the door
through which I had been thrust itito this
place of darkness.
As I expected, the time occupied In the
Eearch was lost: and still the voices in
the next room talked on. Therefore I had
letter-case with the treaty? Keyed now
to a high pitch of excitement, I took out
my matchbox, lighted a wax vesta and
protecting the flame as well as I could,
proceeded to study the hanud writing.
"On Bord the Fome," were the three
ill-spelled words at the top of the first
page. And the Foam was the name of
the boat in which I had crossed the
Channel.
"I'm taking big: risks," were the next
words which I eagerly read, "but needs
must when one is drove to it. I am drove
to what I've Just done, for it's that or
worse. You saved my life and a lot more
to-day, though yem didn't know it, and
I'd bet my last qu&* that you're a gent'l
man and an honest man. I am a julller's
messenger, sir. trusted with a thing
worth many thousands, and from my first
start I knew I was in terrible danger.
Just before I seen you I thot I was done
for, but you saved me, and the only way
is to make you save me agen without
your knowing, for there's reesons why I
ean.'t epeak to you in private or make
sines. On this bote I'm safe, but when I
get to Paris it's worse than before, so
what I done was this: I'm a bit of a ven
trlloklst, and I throw my voise as if it
come from somewhere else on the gang
wax, so, making a disturbance, and in
that way by stumbling agenst you, I
managed to slip a cigar case. In which V I
carried valable Julls for my master, iir
your pocket. But, In t=o doing. I was
obliged to take out a case which you had
there, or you would at once have felt the
thickness, and pulled out what was there,
and then my fat would have bin in the
fire. Besides, you would have bin in
dainger, which was not fare. But hanged
if I'll look in your case, which may have
letters from your sweetheart for all I
know. You can have it agen by giving
me what you have of mine, which is fare
exchange. I can't call on you, for the
reeson I don't know ware you are going,
and dare not hang round to see on ac
count of the terible dainger I run.
"My hope Is to get as quick as I can
to a place where I expect to find a great
friend who will help me to keep it off,
and I must try to reach It without axi
dents. The best I can do is to slip this
note into your pocket like I did the julls,
and that I shall manage In the raleway
station, for I am clever in- those kind of
things. You see how I depend on you to
bring back my master's valable propetty,
like the gent'lman you are; and there
was no other way for me> I have no
time, to explane why. Come as soon as
you can when you have read this to the
back room on the left-hand side of the
passage, top floor. No. 117, Rue de la Ture,
Boolvard St. Michel. I'll be there all
right and I hope my friend; and there are
no words to.expres my gratltood in ad
vance.âYours trustingly, H. J., Juillers
Messenger. P. S.â for heaven's sake
don't fale. and ask the conserge for the
name of Polsson." *
"By Jove!" I Involuntarily exclaimed
aloud as I finished reading this extraor
dinary communication, and so furious
â¢was I at not having discovered it before,
thus saving desperate anxiety for Juliette
and myself, that I hardly remembered
Blight "click" that meant the opening of
the door. I passed Into a dim entrance,
to be challenged by a sleepy voice. pro
ceeding from the concierge's box. A head
showed itself behind the grating, and
monsieur the stranger was requested to
state which resident of- the house , he
wished to see at an hour so late.
I replied that my object was to call
upon Monsieur Polsson, who occupied the
back room at the left, on the top floor,
and if he were not at home I would con
tent myself with the society of his guest,
a gentleman from England who had ar
rived that night.
"Ah, yes, monsieur has been 'here be
fore already," remarked the sleepy con
cierge. "He now returns, as he said he
might do?"
I reflected for the fraction of a second,
then decided that It would be wise not
to correct this impression. It would be
simpler to let the man suppose me to be
this person with an evident right to ad
mittance, rather than run the risk of
Inquiries or a row. It is upon such trifles
as these that the issues of a life hang,
but It is a lesson never learned even by
experience.
"Quite right," I assured the. somnolent
guardian of the house, and pressed on up
the stairs, ascending flight after flight,
and meeting no one.
The upper story, which was the sixth,
was In darkness, though dim lights had
burned In the 'â¢ passage below. I had -to
resort once more to my wax vestas before
I could be quite sure of the door. When
I was sure I knocked, but there was no
answer.
I knocked again and for response had
only-silenceâ a silence that .got on my
nerves. I pounded once more, very hard,
and then when no sound from within fol
lowed I tried the door.
Somewhat to my surprise. It was not
locked. â¢ I opened it. , and crossed the
threshold, stepping from' darkness Into
darkness and smelling a strong odor of
paraffin. I lighted another vestaâ my last
âand had just time to peer about, gaining
a vague idea of the arrangement of a
bare, disorderly and shabby room, when a
draught of air, evidently from an open
window, blew out the little flame and
slammed the door which shut behind me
at the same instant.
My glance around had not .assured me
whether or no the room were occupied;
but if there were an occupant he must be
a sound sleeper not to have been
awakened by my entrance and the strik
ing of a match. I stood still and called
out in English: "Hullo! is any one here?"
No answer came, and I determined to
find my way as best I could to the man
tel, where I might hope to come across
some matches. .
I struck out for this landmark, but was
not sure whether I- kept my sense. of di
rection . clear or not a'fter. I ; had bumped
against a table, and something ' else,'
which proved to be a chair, turned over
on the bare floor. Once I caught my foot
In a rug which had got twis ted up in a
heap, and hardly had I extricated myself
from. this when I slipped and almost lost
my balance by stepping in tome spilled
in the center, the globe and chimney both
broken in pieces and the spilled oil giv
ing forth the strong odor Â¦ of paraffin
which I had detected on opening the door.
But the struggle for life did not account
for all the confusion. The pockets of the
murdered man had been pulled wrong
side out, his waistcoat had been torn
open, I showing the gay blue ' and pink
checked shirt- which I remembered no
ticing In the morning, deeply dyed now
with blood. Papers were scattered ever
the floor, some spotted red, some half
concealed under tangled rugs which had
been roughly kicked out of the way. The
drawers of an escritoire had been. jerked
" out and their contents thrown here and
there: a wardrobe stood wide open, and
various garments flung on the floor with
the pockets in the same condition as
those of the corpse. A chest of drawers
. had also' been ransacked in a fury of
haste, and even the cot-bed had been vio
lently dismantled. ...The whole, room
looked as if a whirlwind had swept
through it; and I, being in the dead man's
secret, needed no explanation of motive
for the deed that' had been done, or the
search which had followed. All the cun
ning of the. poor wretch, who- lay "with
glazed eyes staring up to the ceiling, . a
grin of terror on the lips from . which
. blood had oozed, had proved in vain. He
had saved the diamonds for another man
himself, and lost his life while triumphing
in the expedient that had preserved
them. The glimmer of the candle, which
I had dislodged from its saucer of grease
to hold in my hand, threw grotesque fllck
erings over, the ghastly .face, making the
features live again in a leer so.disquiet
ing that . I threw the - Illumination else
where, turning it by chance upon the
door, and discovering that the bolt which
evidently had fastened it hung half off.
This threw a light upon the past hour of
mystery, enabling me to reconstruct the
scene. , . â¢ Â¦ â¢
I imagined the arrival of the fugitive,
hoping, praying that he had succeeded in
. dodging his pursuers; his disappointment
in finding his friend away; bis precautions
against being disturbed; his ignorance of
the stealthy work being deftly done out
side the bolted door; his start at the sud
den, horrifying sound of Its opening; his
choked protests that he had not the Jew
els with him; his wild struggle to escape,
and thenâ the end.
' It was a hateful picture for the imagin
ation, so luridly vivid here on the spot
where the drama had been enacted that
I resolutely shut my eyes upon It and con
centrated my. thoughts on the work before
me. . '.')
The state of the room did not promise
much for my purpose, since the murderer
or murderers had gone ; through every
thing in their hunt for the diamonds;
- still, ; it was not Â¦ impossible \ that' In their
mad ; haste for the one thing, they had
passed the treaty.; over ' as : of no ; import
ance. - Â¦ Â¦-' - Â¦ . V..'* .'Â¦ :"..". ' â¢
â¢ I moved about the room with the flaring
candle: end,; avoiding the pool of ; blood
into which I'd blundered In the dark, and
' disgusted . at seeing the 'Â¦* horrid ' signs of
"contact on my feet and the hand .which
â¢, had .touched; the corpse." Even -ray shirt
; cuff was smeared; i but Â¦Â¦_ I ,. hid . the red
smudge from my own eyes by putting my
to murmur pretty things on the way,
though I heardly heard them.
I was thankful to be in my own room;
but when I was there I didn't begin to
undress, or even sit down to rest,
though I was still rather shaky. I went
to one of the windows, opened It wide,
and stood looking out. c ' -
Down there somewhere, under the sky
turned black by the electric lights that
glared up at It, was Noel Brent, who at
this very hour last night had been tell
ing me, at our dance, that he loved me
more than the whole worldâ that I was,
had been, and ever would be, the one
woman on earth for him. Here was I re
membering every. word he had said, hear
ing the very sound of his voice; down
there was he*, going to keep a midnight
appointment with that other woman, for
whose sake he had broken with me.
With what a strange sorcery she must
have bewitched him! I thought with a
sad bitterness. It was almost Impossible
not to believe that he had meant what he
looked and said last night; yet a few
hours later at a call from her he forgot
me, enmeshed by the old fascination. The
only grace left in him now had caused
him to flush and stammer a little as un
der my eyes he refused Lord Gawain's
invitation to stop with us, making an an
nouncement of a prior engagement, which
he must have known to my ears virtually
amounted to a confession.
I was still at the window when at the
door between my room and the next I
heard a knocking, which was accompa
nied by the voice of Marlon.
"Dearest, please let me in," she said. "I
want very much to see you." .-.Â¦â¢'
Now, I had never liked Marion less in
my life than I had to-day, though really
I think she bad meant to serve me. But
always when she has irritated me, and I
have, nearly been cross, I feel so remorse
ful that I try to be nicer to her than be
fore, for I am very sorry for Marion, who
Is not quite like other girls In her looks,
and Is besides so delicate that almost
anything she does ought to be excusable.
I didn't want at all to see her, but I
went to the door/ which separated her
room from mine and let her in.
She thanked me and flung herself down
on a sofa. "I don't feel very well, either,"
she said, "and I couldn't eat, so I thought
I. would come upstairs too." With this she
Jumped off the sofa and began walking up
and down. "I'm so restless I feel as if I
should die," she exclaimed. "It's just as if
the air were full of electricity. Don't you
feel it so?"
"Yes, I do." I answered. "I suppose it's
the change." - : vi j
"No," said Marion, looking' eerie and
haggard as a witch. "It's because some
thing's going to happen."
This was really, curious, for it appeared
that she had exactly the sensation I was
trying to control.
'.'I'm superstitious," she went on; "more
so to-night than I ever was. . It's just as
if a voice were calling meâ somewhere;
and I'd got to obey it I know now how
the sailors felt when the sirens _ lured
them. Do you guess why I came to your
room? It was because when we washed
our. faces before going In to supper I left
my hat here. I'm going out, Margot."
giving her orders to the cabman, there
fore, when at last he drew up In a dull
little street, with hardly a light In any of
the houses, and began to walk his horse
very slowly.
"What are we doinsr here?" I exclaimed.
"This Is where I want to see the Inter
esting people go In and out." said Ma
rlon, In a defiant sort of way.
"Why. what street is It?" I asked.
' "It is the Rue d'Anjou." she answered,
but the name suggested nothing to me.
"I don't think it looks very promising,"
said I.
â¢ "Don't you? Walt a few minute* and
you may change your mind. Ah I " she
thrust her head from the window with a
whispered ejaculation of such excitement
that I peered curiously over her shoulder.
A closed carriage was driving into the
street. It stopped before a gate set In an
ugly high wall, and our coupe was in
such a position on the opposite elde of
the way that we could see a groom Jump
down, open the door and help a woman in
a long white evening coat to get out.
The street was rather dark, but there
was enough light from a lamp near by to
give us a glimpse of a beautiful profile
and shining waves of heavy auburn hair.
I drew back as if I had been struck*
"Marlon," I exclaimed, "what does this
mean? That was Juliette de Nevers!"
"Yes. that Is her house. I read an In
terview with her in a paper not long ago
which spoke about It and described it. I
remembered the name of the street." an
swered Marlon, as calmly as If she had
been talking of the weather.
Her manner and the trick she had
played upon me made me so angry that
my heart beat very fast and my breatS
came quickly.
"I don't know why you earn* here," X
said; "but I do know that I'm not going
to stay another momentâ spying upon a
person whose movements can't possibly
concern me."
Suddenly, to my surprise, from being
defiant Marion became pleading. "Oh,
Margot darling," . she implored, "for my
sake and your own rake don't go. It is
entirely for you that I came, but I dared
not let you guess what was In my mind,
for I knew you wouldn't listen to my
persuasions. All day I have been feeling
horribly guilty lest It was my fault that
you were giving up Noel Brent. I did
what I thought right this morning, and
I still believe it was right. But suppose
it were all a plot of Juliette de Never*
to get Noel away from youâ how should
I feel if I ever found out I had been play
ing into her hands and spoiled your lifer*
"You need not reproach yourself," I
said. "I* heard all that was necessary
from his own lips at Charing Cross."
"But if there were a misunderstanding
and he was' too honorable to defend him

can be quite sure till one* sees with one's
own eyes. He may merely have seen her
at the theaterâ perhaps, bound by a prom
ise which he'd forgotten, till she remind
ed him of it. It may be all over and done
with now. Very likely that appointment
he spoke of at the hotel was not with
her. Can't you understand how my part

your lover comes to call at this actress'
house after midnight Then, whatever
happened, I need no longer blame my
self." -: .
"You reason very strangely," I said,
as quietly as I could. "And there can be
no excuse for spying. That is all I have
to 6ayâ except that I am going hdme
now."
â¢"Then you will leave me here alone?"
cried Marion, with a shrill sound in her
voice as though she were on the point of
bursting into sobs.
That sound made me rather gentler, for
father and I have always schooled our
selves to be gentle with Marion, no mat
ter how difficult. "No. of course not,"
I said, soothingly. "I shouldn't dream of
leaving you alone. We will simply tell
the coachman to drive us back to the
hotel."
"If you go in the coupe," returned
Marion, beginning to gasp ominously, "I
shall have to stand here In the street
and goodness knows what may come of
It at this tima of night I must etay.
I've vowed to do that, and I always keep
mv word, even with myÂ»eif. I am deter
mined to know for duty's sake, if nothing
else, whether or not injustice has been
done Noel Brent; and I will know, at
whateveT sacrifice."
I was so aghast at her. and so at a loss
what to do with any one who seemed so
Insane, that for a moment I could not
think what to say. And In that moment
something happened. A very handsome,
tall, dark young Frencnman appeared in
the street close to where our coupe was
drawn up at the pavement In an In
stant he had disappeared again; but as
he passed us I heard something fall on
the asphalt with a soft thud that had a
subdued undertone of a "chink" in It
I was looking out of the window on
that side, for I'd been ready to direct the
coachman to take us home, and, I saw
that a little silk bag lay on the pavement
I was sure that the young man must
have dropped it and was Just on the
point of calling after him when Marion
gripped my arm very hard. "Sh!" shÂ«
whispered, "unless you want Noel Brent
to know. There hÂ« is, down there at
Juliette de Nevers' gate; and oh, Â«ee!
somebody's letting him In. Somebody
must have been waiting."
There was a queer note In her voice
that sounded more like Joy than sorrow;
but to do her Justice, I was In no state
to Judge of other people's feelings and
motives. I even forgot about the young
man who had dropped the silk bag close
to our carriage. I started back from the
window, though it was on the wrong side
and we were almost at the far end of the
street from Mademoiselle de Nevers*
house.
I sat shrinking against the cushions for
a few minutes in. a perfect panic for fear
Noel should suspect and think I had come
to spy upon him; but after awhile I re
covered myself a little, and said that If
Marion wouldn't drive home with me I
would leave her and get out and walk.
"I must wait and know how long he
stops with her," she exclaimed, with such
a greedy, curious air, that I could stand
no more. I flung open the door. Jumped
out of the coupe and almost stepped on
the little Â«llk bag.
Quite mechanically I stooped and picked
tt up, looking first one way and then the
other; but the young man who had. I was
sure, dropped it was nowhere to be seen.
It Is queer how, when you are only inter
ested in one thing in the world, still an
other part of your brain goes on acting
Independently of your real thoughts. I
suppose there must have been a vague
idea In my preoccupied mind that it would
be better to take home the bag as the
owner was gone, and then advertise It In
the paper, rather than let it lie In the
street perhaps to be carried off by some
dishonest person.
Anyway, I kept the bag In my hand,
though at the time I scarcely seemed to
be thinking about It I was listening to
Marlon, who begged me to come into the
coupe again and she would do anything I
wished. So I did, and we drove back to
the hotel, where I got out feeling as if the
whole experience had been a hateful
dream. And It was not until I had betn
In bed for nearly an hour that I remem
bered I must have left the silk bag In the
coupe, as I had no recollection of it after
getting Into the carriage and laying it in
my lap. I was sorry that I hadn't left it
in the street instead of taking responsi
bility upon myself and then failing to
carry it out But of course, it was too
late to do anything until next day. and I
could only hope that there had been noth
ing of real value in the bagâ unless the
coachman proved scrupulously honest
It was a wretched night Never once
did I close my eyes. I was thoroughly
ashamed and humiliated, as well as un
happy. Maybe I had been vain, and
needed the punishment for my self-con
celt for I had been conceited enough to
believe that Noel loved me, and would be
true to tne even in spite of the fascina
tions of a beautiful woman like Juliette
de Nevers. Of course, though she is an
actress, she is received in society, and Is
tremendously admired for her beauty and
wit as well as her cleverness, so that she
Is a very formidable rival for any girl.
EU11, I am afraid I've been rather spoilt,
for I thought that Noel would prove true
to me, notwithstanding the .flirtations
Marlon mad* so much of with Made
xdolselle de Nevers and several other
women more or less prominent In the
world. But he himself had shown me un-
all three complimented tne on looking ex
tremely well; and already I tried to be
gin flirting a little, according to the agree
ment I had made with myself.
After breakfast I slipped away for a
minute while the others were planning
about going out, and told the people in
th9 bureau that I had lost a little silk
bag in the coupe last nightâ it would
have been useless to particularize about
its not being mine.
They said that they would sand to the
stables at once and see if such a thing
had been found: but I could not wait to
learn whether the cabman was honest or
not. I ran in to see Marion, pretending
to be very bright and gay, and ief using
to talk of what had passed last night.
She did not want to drive with us to see
the motor car, but it was arranged that
Aunt Clem and I should come back, for
her afterward, and we would go out to
gether shopping and luncheon at some
nice amusing place where our two men
would meet us.
We were a long time looking at the mo
tor car and deciding, for Lord Gawain
and Captain Menxies were both enthu
siasts about that kind of thing, it seemed.
Then came our calling at the hotel for
Marion, and a stroll through several shops
in thÂ« Rue de la Paix: and it was two
o'clock when we got to Ritz's, although
we had promised Lord Gawain to be there
at half-past one.
He and Captain Menzies were waiting
for us, and Lord Gawain had a newspaper
in his hand. They both looked 6O queer
and grave that the minute we met Aunt
Clem asked what was the matter, wheth
er they had news that any of our friends
were ill or dead.
"Noel Brent is accused of murder," said
Lord Gawain. in his abrupt, tactless way.
But I couldn't believe my ears. I stood
listening stupidly, with a foolish half
smile on my face, while he went on ex
citedly to tell things which hardly seemed
to mean anything to me. '
"What nonsense!" I heard Aunt Clem
exclaim. "Why. we were talking to him
last night in our own hotel. He was all
right then."
"I'm afraid it was that appointment of
his which wasn't all rigM." her husband
said. "Anyway, it seems to have got him
into trouble. It's in this afternoon's Echo
de Paris, and no doubt the other papersâ
the most extraordinary story I ever came
across in my lifeâ reads like melodrama.
It seems Brent wanted to find a certain
man here whom ho couldn't find, and
went last evening: to a private detective
chap named Dubois. who has been giving
evidence to the police; lost no time In be
ginning the hunt, got hot on the scent at
last, followed it to a house in a street
near the Boulevard St. Michel, and there
in the room where he had been led to ex
pect he would find his quarry came upon
Noel Brent (who had. after all, been clev
er enough to get ahead of the detective
In the search) ransacking the room, and
covered with the blood of the wanted
man, whose dead body lay on the floor."
CHAPTER XI.
"FOR MORE THAN LIFE."
It seemed as If It were another person,
and not I, who went back that afternoon
to the Elysee Palace Hotel after hearing
that Noel Brent was in prison on a charge
of murder.
Naturally we were all certain that there
was a monstrous mistake; but If he had
been a stranger to us and we had read
the report in the newspapers we would
have thought the evidence very strong
against him. Dear Aunt Clem, who likes
and admires Noel immensely, tried to
laugh angrily and say how horrid and
ridiculous these French people were, al
ways doing something sensational and
stupid, having to eat humble pie after
ward. But Lord Gawain and Captain
Menzies did not think that the authorities
would have to eat humble pie at all,
however the case went, for they could not
do otherwise than they had done In the
face of the evidence. I did hate them so
for talking like that Men are horrid
when they parade their sense of Justice,
not making any difference whether it's an
affair of a friend or an enemy. But, of
course, no one in the party except Marion
dreamed that there had been anything
more than friendship between Noel and
me, so they talked quite freely.
As I listened to the evidence given so
far, which Lord Gawain explained to us.
as we did not care to read about It In the
paper, and realized the danger in which
Noel stood, all my proud resentment
against him seemed to be very trivial. No
matter what his behavior toward me had
been, he must have been sorely, tempted
by that other woman, and he was inno
cent of this crime with which they
charged him. I could not help forgiving
him everything, down deep In my heart,
and loving and yearning orer him with a
great tenderness, though he was nothing
to me any moreâ not even . a friend. I
wanted more than anything In the whole
world to help him, and as Lord Gawain
discussed the dreadful affair, I thought I
saw a way in which I couldâ Marion and
I together.
At least, Noel was splendidly loyal to
that woman at whose gate we had seen
him. When questioned he nad refused to
say where he had been between midnight
and ten minutes to 2. at which time the
detective had found him by the body of
the murdered man. among a heap of scat
tered papers, which showed that the room
had been ransacked In --Â»-~n of some
thing.
It h* ha/4 />Vif>eÂ»n in foil narViann ViÂ«
crime, whether It was likely that after
committing a murder he would choose to
come back and remain* for some time in
the room with the dead body of his vic
tim: but that went for nothing because
of the disordered condition of the room,
which proved that a long and exhaustive
search had been made. And a motive
was supplied apparently through a state
ment of the detective, Dubols, who said
that Noel's object In having the mur
dered man "shadowed" was because a
thing of enormous value had been stolen,
which must be recovered immediately on
pain of the most disastrous consequences.
I was bo anxious to speak . alone with
Marion that when we got back to the
hotel I made her come into my room and
began at once upon the subject which I
had refused to discuss with her earlier in
the morning. I said very excitedly that,
as we knew Noel had been with Juliette
de Nevers at the time when the murder
was being committed, it seemed to me
that we ought to come forward and prove
an alibi, or whatever they call it, in spite
of himself.
But Marion had been thinking the thing
over more calmly than I had. She point
ed out to me that even If we took so bold
a course as to bring Mile, de Nevers'
name into the case when Noel was sac
rificing so Â¦ much to save ,her, we could
do him no real good. I flew to the con
clusion at first that this argument .was
mere sophistry, because Marion was
ashamed of what we had done and could
not bear to be compromised; but she
went on to remind me that it was only
about twenty minutes or so past twelve
when Noel had gone In at the gate In
the Rue d'Anjou, and for all we. could
prove to the contrary he might have come
out again ten minutes later, for we had
not remained in the street longer than
that after seeing him.
If I had not been so obstinately deter
mined to go away, she said, but had con
sented to wait as she begged me to do,
we might actually be in a position now
to save Noel In spite of himself; but as It
was we could do nothing which would
help him in the eyes of tne law, for there
would have been plenty of time for him
to go from the Rue d'Anjou to the Rue
de la Tour between half-past 12 and the
tfcne when the man there was murdered.
I couldn't help seeing that Marion had.
right on her side, still I could not give
up the hope of doing something, when we
seemed to know so much; and it was so
dreadful to be told that our helplessness
was "all my fault" that I had to beg
Marion to leave me alone for a few min
utes, feeling that I should not be mistress
of myself.
She was angry at being asked to go
away, and slammed and bolted the door
between our roomsâ but I did not care.
I wanted to thinkâ and perhaps to cry.
However, I hadn't time to begin before
there was a knock at the other door, and
a servant of the hatel handed In a little
parcel.
It was something which I had lost the
night before, he explained, and had been
sent to me, as I had left instructions at
the bureau.
I gave the man ten francs for the hon
est coachman, and almost mechanically
(not being in a mood to take interest in
irrelevant matters) I opened the brown
paper wrappings. Sure enough, inside
was the silk bag which I had so stupidly
forgotten in the coupe, and I untied the
ribbons, peeping in with. the idea of find
ing an addrass.
Even In my preoccupation I was aston
ished at what I did seeâ a wonderful
necklace of diamonds, or at least, if not
diamonds, a marvelous Imitation.
At any other time I should have been
curious and excited, and my first thought
would have been to put an advertisement
in the paper; but as it was It didn't seem
to matter very much whether the hand
some young man who had dropped the
bag got his property back to-morrow or
next week, though, of course, . he mustâ
if thÂ© Jewels were realâ be In a terrible
state of mind about it by this time.
I simply put the bag into a writing-case
that was in my big, fitted travelling bag,
locked it up, and went on working out
the plan that had come into my head
even before I had sent Marion out of the
room.
Perhaps the idea was an absolutely mad
one, but I wanted more than I had ever
wanted anything to see Noelâ not as a
lover, oh no I but merely as a friend
falsely accused of a crime whom I might
be able to help.
I had no knowledge of French police
procedure, but it seemed just possible
that I might be allowed to see him in
the presence of others, if the authorities
knew who I really was; and I thought, as
father liked Noel, he would not object to
my making use of his name as a sort of
passport, provided I could manage it.
Then it occurred to me that, as the police
people might not believe me If I went and,
announced that I was the daughter of the
British Home Secretary, I had better jo
to our Embaasador, who is a friend of
father's and ask if he could do anything
for me.
I could see that Sir George was reluct
ant to do anything for me in the matter,
perhaps because if he had a daughter he
would not thank my father to interfere
in such a way. But I persuaded him that
If he didn't help me I would try what I
could do without any help, which would
make things a lot worse. So he wrote a
letter to the Chief of the Police in Paris,
saying who I was, and asking as a favor
that I might be permitted a few minutes'
conversation with the accused man.
before it becomes more disagreeable. And
as for me, I saw you in the street after
you left us all in the hotel; that is why
I mention the other matter, because you
can guess that the two might be con
nected, and If there Is anything I can
I spoke very, very fast, hoping that the
warder might not be familiar enough with
English to catch every word, and only
hinting things Instead of saying them
straight out. But when I had gone so
far, Noel cut me short.
"I can't tell you how much I thank you
for this," he said. "It's ( far | beyond
thanks, though it's like you to have come,
Margâ Miss Revelstoke. It's comfort
enough formfc to think you should do It,
but as for what you propose it must not
be. Nothing would be gainedâ rather the
other way. Believe me when I say that
I know this. And neither you nor any of
my friends whoâ who are kind enough to
careâ must be troubled about me. Every
thing will surely come right, sooner or
later, though I may have to suffer a lit
tle annoyance for a while."
"Annoyance!" I echoed. "If only it Is
no worse than that."
"It won't be. I shall be well defended.
It will all be shown up as a huge mis
take."
"Is there nothing Iâ we can do, then?"
I asked, miserably conscious that he was
determined not to have Juliette de Nev
ers' name brought in.
He hesitated for a moment. "I sup
pose." he said at last, "that there's no use
hoping you will believe me innocent of
something else whichâ hurts me worse
than the accusation that has landed me
here?"
"I think there's not much use talking of
that." I answered.
"Well," sighed Noel, "I won't talk of it
then, though I hopedâ oh, don't misunder
stand meâ I know that after all this dis
graceful publicity I would not have the
right to press for anything beyond bare
justice. I wouldn't do it even if I had the
right. But I hoped you might have come
to say that, though nothing could be as
It might have been, you believed me
true!
The tears started to my eyes and I
turned away. "This wouldn't have made
any difference," I said in a muffled, brok
en voice. "But there even are more rea
sons why I can't believe what you ask
me to than you know. That's partly why
I came, for I would give'anythmg to help
"I regret to inform mademoiselle that
the five minutes permitted for her inter
view with the prisoner have expired." an
nounced the warder in French. "She will
have time but for adieu."
I held out my hand to Noel, and he
grasped it. pressing it so tightly that it
hurt. "Anything!" I repeated.
Suddenly a light flashed into his eyes,
and his face flushed up to his forehead.
You are an angel of generosity." he
said, in a conventional tone, though a
quiver ran through his voice. Then, very
low and au.ck-so quick, so unexpectedly
that I could scarcely understandâ he spoke
In Italian. "For more than my life, go to
the room of the murder; get in somehow,
and take from the front of the stove, un
der the ashes, a parchment. Give it to
Juliette with your own hands. Every mo
ment counts. I've no one else to ask, or
I'd cut off my hand sooner than put it on
you.' 1
With a swift. resentfHl movement of
suspicion the warder came close to us.
"That is forbidden!" he said sternly. "In
what language did you speak?"
"He spoke in Italian." I answered has
tily, looking as Innocent as I could "and
he only bade me good-by. We' have
been very dear friends. It Is hard not to
have a last word for purselves alone."
Â¦ "That may be true; but it is neverthe
less forbidden," replied the warder, glar
ing reproachfully at Noel. "I must re
port this: and no further communication
can be permitted."
With this, Noel was so Bharply ordered
to go that my ears tingled, and I should
have liked to kill the whole French police
force. To hear a little wretched police
man speak like that to my dear, brave,
big Englishman, and to know that It
would only be childish of him to resistâ
oh, it was unbearable!
Noel only held his head rather high, and
pressed his lips together^ and at the door
as he was going out he threw me back
one look. It said as plainly as if he had
spoken: "Remember!"
I did Indeed remember; but it was not
until I had driven part of the way toward
home that I entirely realized the full
meaning of those few hurried, stolen
sentences in Italian, with which Noel had
defied the law.
I was to goâ I was to doâ oh, it wasn't
possible that Noel should have asked such
a thin* of me!
But the protest of my soul could not
change thfe thing that was. He had asked
it, and he had said that it meant "mote
than his life." He had dared to send me
on a mission to that woman for whose
sake he had flung my love away, andâ I
would go. Oh, yes, I would go, if it killed
me. I had told him that I would "do any
thing," and he had taken advantage.
A kind of fury possessed me. If I had
known that death in some ghastly form
awaited me in the horrible house to which
Noel .was sending me, still I would have
gone. . â¢
When the first confession of my. mind
had passed I thought very clearlyâ as
clearly as I ever had in my life.
Noel's wordsâ "get In somehow"â were
in themselves a warning that I should
, have . difficulty in getting aamitiance to
the room where the murder had been
done. '
I tried to think it all out, ignorant as
I was of such things. The body, proba
bly, would have been taken away by the
time, but perhaps the house would be
guarded by the police.. If not thatâ since
many people lived there and would be
inconvenienced by such a proceedingâ at
all events It was certain that strangers
would not be allowed to prowl morbidly
at their own sweet will about the room
where a great crime had been committed.
To get in and do what Noel wanted done
without being seen in the act, and more
harm than good accomplished, I would
have to bribe somebody very heavily.
Even that might not succeedâ but it
would surely be the only hope; and I
turned my attention to considering my
resources.
I had left home at very short notice
and had only brought with me to Paris
what I had at handâ enough to do a little
shopping, which would be more a cloak
for my state of mind that a genuine
pleasure.
This morning I had started out with
about Â£20, after giving Marion the same
amount, and I had bought a couple of
expensive hats, some silk stockings and
some smart handkerchiefs in the Rue de
la Paix, so that now I hadn't much more
than Â£5 left. Marlon had spent quite as
much as I had, and I rembered laughing
at Aunt Clem's slang, when she had ex
claimed on the way to Ritz's that she was
"cleaned out."
If I found that I had to bribe some po
liceman In charge, or even the concierge,
it would be worse than useless to make a
stingy bid. I must offer so large an
amount that, even if the bribed official
were discovered and dismissed, he would
have at least what we could have earned
in his situation in a year. That might
really tempt him. The sum that suggest
ed itself to me was Â£100. I might begin
with offering less, but I would want to
have that to work up If necessary. Yet
how was I to get it?
Of course, I might apply to Lord Ga
waln, but he is such a reckless man
about money, always forgetting to take
enough when he goes anywhera, that it
was doubtful if he would have half as
much to spare in a hurry; and even if he
had he would be very curious and sur
prised at my asking for it at a moment's
notice. And I must have it at a moment's
notice, for Noel had said, with a desper
ate look in his eyes, that "every minute
counted."
There wasn't time to telegraph home
there wasn't time to do anything; but
suddenly in the cab I clapped my hand*
together and gave a little cryâ for the
queerest idea had darted into my head.
They knew in the hotel who I was, and
that If I said I could get money at a cer
tain time it would be all right. I couldn't
ask them very well to U-nd It, though,
with no security at all. But there was
that diamond necklace I had found. It
wouldn't be claimed till to-morrow some
time, even if I sent an advertisement to
the papers the first thing when I got
homeâ which I shouldn't really -take time
to do; and, meanwhile, I would ask the
manager to loan me Â£100 on it. If it were
real, as I hoped, he might do that as a
favor; and I could get the money from
home in twenty-four hours; yet if It were
not real? Well, I could but try!

CHAPTER XII.
ON THE RACK.
We had looked everywhere for the dia
mond necklace, Maxlme and I, and to him,
poor fellow, its loss for the second time
seemed all-important He did not see in
red letters, always before his eyes, these
two words. "The Treaty," as I did. He
was in happy ignorance of that other loss
which Iâ I, of all people in the world
had inflicted upon him. He was satisfied
with my statement that by means of a
person employed by me the necklace had
been recovered and given to him as a sur
prise. Â«
We searched the garden, the whole
street, and came back to search for the
second time the drawing room where we
had talked together. But it was all in
vain, and at last he left me to retrace his
steps along the way he had come, and to
make inauiries for the cab In which he
had driven part of the distance.
As for me, there was no thought of
steep, but when I had unlocked the door
of the boudoir, found the room empty and
the window j open, and talked with old
Henri (who admitted having seen the
English gentleman stealing cautiously
away). . there was nothing left for me to
do save wait in the. dim hope that Noel
Brent might return with news.
Clinging to this hope, I would not go
to bed. But when five o'clock came and
he had not returned, it seemed that for
an hour or two at least I must give. up
the Idea of seeing him. I undressed, there
fore," and went to bed.
When I awoke and looked hastily at my
watch, to my dismay it was after eleven
o'clock. I was wild with fear lest the
servants in their well-meaning stupidity
had sent important visitors away, refus
ing to disturb me. But when Agnes came
flying In answer to my violent ringing of
the bell, she said that no one had been.
There were letters, and a telegram, and
Henri had bought all the morning pa
pers.
The telegram proved to be from Max
lme, saying that he had not recovered
wumi w*s !.Â»., ui itutrnea anytmng cuu
cerning it. From Noel Brent there was
no word at all: and I could not under
stand his silence. Not to come or to
write, or even to wire!â it was cruel :i
less something had happened to him. i
determined to send Henri to the ElyÂ«-e
Palace Hotel to inquire, and did so, about
12 o'clock-
Henri was not long In doing his errand,
though U seemed forever to me. When he
came, however, it was but to tell me that
which sharpened my anxiety.
"Mr. James Quest of Birmingham"
(that was the name, of course, for which
I had directed Henri to inquire) had gone
out after supping about midnight and
had not yet returned to the hotel.
The only delay of which my poor, affec
tionate old servant had been guilty was a
short ope. He had stopped and bought
all the evening papers, which, when he
had given me the news, he thrust into
my hands with a beaming countenance.
I would have flung the papers aside
without a glance when Henri's back was
turned had it not suddenly occurred to
me that, if Noel Brent had had an acci
dent of any sort. It might be reported.
When I read what had happenedâ how
he was accused of murder and while de
claring his innocence had refused to state
how and where he had spent the time be
tween midnight and a quarter to 2 in the
morning, my heart -went out to him In
a wave of gratitude for his brave loyalty.
Here was a man! He declined to speak
the words which would prove me a liar
to Maxlme and compromise me beyond
repair in the eyes of my lover.
My first Impulse was to hasten to the
Chief of Police, with whom I was per
sonally acquainted, and say: "Monsieur,
this gentleman cannot have committed
a murder in the Rue de la Tour between
midnight and a quarter to 2. for at twenty
minutes past 12 he came to my house and
did not leave till nearly half-past 1, as my
servant can prove."
I even sprang from my chair to ring
for Agnes and call for my hat and gloves
and order my carriage. Butâ I sat down
again and deliberately crushed the im
pulse. I could not yield to It. I dared
not.
It was after 3 when Agnes, who had at
last despaired of inducing me to take
food, came again to the door of my bou
doir where I sat.
"Mademoiselle, the Count Ipanoff Is
here," she announced.
The words aroused me. "Send him
away. I will not see him!" I cried, an
grily.
"But he has sent a note, mademoiselle,
which he begs you to read. Here it is."
Curiosity born of fear made me open it.
I yielded to its bidding, and thenâ I
changed my mind, as doubtless he had
foreseen. I told Agnes that Count Ipan
off should come to me in the boudoir.
He entered, smilingâ and the door was
softly closed.
"Well?" I said shortly, thrusting my
hands behind me when he held out his.
"My note told you the truth. I have
news for you. Of course you have seen
the papers? You know that your English
friend is in trouble?"
"The English friend whom you would
have liked to see arrested last night on a
ridiculous, baseless charge," I sneered,
boldly assuming my suspicions to be
facts. "This, no doubt, will also soon bÂ«
shown to be baseless, because It Is equal
ly ridiculous."
"Ridiculous or not," said Ipanoff, "it Is
likely to cause you trouble, as well as
your discreet friend."
"I do not see that." I answered. "My
name does not enter Into the affair at all.
You have saidâ my friend Is discreet. Be
sides, It is nothing to me. What have I
to do with it?"
"As to that, you know best. But I com*
to you, as before, out or friendship, to
warn you, to help you, if I can."
"Your friendshipâ your help!". I echoed,
scornfully.
"You may need, and be thankful to
avail yourself of both. Would you not be
glad, to begin with, if you could know
what questions the Juge d'Instruction has
put to Mr. Noel Brent and what answers
Mr. Noel Brent has made?"
Strange that this very thought had been
torturing me before the man appearedâ
the thought that questions had been asked
and answers given which might mean
everything â¢ to me if I could only bear
them. But I answered, "That is impossi
ble. No one can know except the two
men present." .
"Three men were present. Besides those
two there was the lawyer whom the Eng
lishman has employed to see him through
the case. It is permitted now that the
accused shall be accompanied by his law
yer when he comes before the Juge d'In
struction. The gentleman whom your
friend has chosen is an acquaintance of
mine and is Indebted to me for his first
successful case. It is odd, Is It not. what
a fancy Monsieur Brent has for employ
ing my friends? Last night It was Du
bols. To-day It is Duplessis."
"You keep yourself singularly well In
formed of the movements of your friends
âand your enemies," I said. "But I ques
tion whether your information is often
trustworthy. I have reason to know that
you haveâ made mistakes."
"It would not be difficult for you to be
lieve If you understood the formalities.
Monsieur Brent's only need of a lawyer
to-day with the Juge d'Instruction was
to have a man who' would see that his
client's ignorance of French law did not
plunge him into stupidities which would
prejudice his cause."
mutaKaciy now roonsn nan wen my con
fidence In my own poor little power of
holding him. and I told myself over and
over again that I was completely dis
illusioned, that my love for Noel had
come to an end with my faith In him. I
even made up my mind that I would flirt
desperately with Captain Meniies, who Is
very good looking and nice; and if It ware
really true, as Aunt Clem said, that he
had been In love with my photograph for
a. year and carried It about with him in
South Africa, I would try to make him
more in love still with me, so that he
might propose as Quickly as possible.
He had done such brave things in tha
war that people were talking a great deal
about him, and if I decided to accept him
(which would please dear Aunt Clem),
Noel would be sure to see lots of para
graphs about the engagement In the pa
pers. I thought I should like to come out
very soon, ao that Noel would believe I
had not cared at all seriously for him.
In the morning, when It was time to get
up (it seemed as if it never, never would
be, the hours wer* so long), I stared at
myself critically in the glass, but I didn't
look as badly as one might have sup
posed. I was only a little pale, and my
eyes seemed somehow extraordinarily
large. I was glad I hadn't brought a
maid, for it was Just as well to be alone;
and after I had a cold bath and dressed
and pinched my cheeks, I really looked
very fit.
Marion didn't $et up for breakfast, but
I went down because I knew that Aunt
Clem and the others meant to be early,
on account of seeing the new motor car.
Sure enough they were in the cafe be
fore ne, and Aunt Clem had been so
anxious about ,my "attack of falntness"
that I . felt wretchedly guilty, thinking
of what Marion and X had sneaked out
to do after I had excused myself. But
might have saved himself, for several doc
tors gave evidence that the murder must
have been committed nearly an nour be
fore the crime was discovered by the very
detective whom Noel had employed to
seek the dead man.
Yet he would only say that he had left
the hotel at such and such a time and had
been walking the streets since, mention-
Ing some of the streets through which
he had passed. But nobody had come
forward who had seen him there, and the
concierge at the house where the murder
had been done made matters look very
badly for Noel by saying that, though he
had not been In the room during the
whole hour which must have elapsed,
when he came at about half -past 1, It
was for the second time. It seemed that
somebody had called an hour earlier, ask
ing In very English sort of French for a
Monsieur Poisson, an English friend of
hif. The concierge had been already In
bed in his little box, and had been too
sleepy to notice this man's face. The
only thing he had thought of was the
English-sounding accent, and as Monsieur
Poisson (who was away for the day)
often bad callers in the middle of the
night, he (the concierge) had not been
surprised that the little gentleman, who
had come to stay till Monsieur Polsson's
return, should also have a visitor at a
late hour.
When the concierge had been sound
asleep again for a while the English caller
went out, saying . he might come back.
And then the bell rang again and a man
came in for Monsieur Poisson, whom the
concierge supposed to be the same, but
would i.ot have been absolutely certain
(as he was very tired and sleepy) if he
had not asked and the man had ad
mitted it.
Noel had demanded. In denying the

what it would be to come suddenly face
to face with Noel in circumstances so ter
ribly changed, or what his opinion of me
and my motives would be for coming to
him without being asked, now that we
were not even friends.
But all the terror of it came over me
while I waited In an ugly little bare re
ception-room, and every nerve and vein in
my whole body was throbbing, so that I
couldn't make up my mind what I meant
to Bay.
While I sat waitingâ a perfect mass of
electric wiresâ there was a sound of foot
steps outside the door, and when It opened
there stood Noel himself, with two men in
uniform. One of them came in with himâ
I suppose he must have been the warderâ
and he stopped near the door of the room,
which was so small that everything one
said in an ordinary tone of voice could
be heard from one end to the other.
I sprang up. from the chair In which I
had been sitting and began to talk as
quickly as I could, for there was a
strange look in Noel's eyes which pierced
my heart, and I did not know What he
might say before he understood my posi
tion. .
"We were all so dreadfully sorry for
what has happened, Mr. Brent," I stam
mered, trying to be quite cool, like an
ordinary friend, though suddenly I loved

and I would not fall' her; but before my
promise was kept there wan something
else. to doâ something else upon which de
pended far more than my lifeâ Maxime's
honor, which I (deluding myself with the
thought It was for his sake) had dared to
risk. *
As I drove, having told my coachman to
take me to* the Foreign Office, thoughts,
plans, hopes and fears beat in my bruin,
like the fluttering wings of imprisoned
birds. , . â¢ . .
How was I to make all rightâ If all
"there was a paperâ or rather a parch
ment of some Importance to you, per
haps "
I darted at the girl and caught at her
wrist, hardly knowing what I did. "For
Heaven's sake," I gasped, "what do you
know of the parchment?"
"If I could get it for you "
"What, you would bargain still, at such
a moment? If you but guessed! Any
thingâask anything you like for the
parchment. If it is yours to give, and you
shall have It."
"I ask ybu to tell the authorities that
Noel Brent was here last night from
twenty minutes past 12 untilâ until "
"Until half-past 1," I finished, thought
lessly; then I saw by the lightening of
her face that, young as she was, child
ishly innocent as she looked, she had all
along been cleverer, more self-controlled
than I in this matter, and had been lead
ing me on.
"You will tell the police that?"
"I must. If you will sell me the parch
ment at no less price. Yet, if I do what
you ask it will spoil my life. The man I
love will know, and he can never know
the real truth."
"Let me take him the diamonds and
say to him that Noel Brent and I found
them. That we were at your house last
night. That would be true, for I was at
the gate. I misjudged Noel as you say
your lover may misjudge you, but I see
more clearly now. And though I hadn't
quite given him a promise before we
quarreled, to make up to him for every
thing, I would marry him as soon as he
was free. It Is for you to help free him.
Have I made it easier for you to do
that?" ,
"A trifle," I said with a sigh. .'/I must
risk it Anything for the parchment, for
that may save me yet. Though how you
can possibly have got It into your pos
session I cannot imagine. Surely the po
lice must have searched their prisoner be
fore he "
"No. not before he had time to save It.
He hid it In the stove In the room where
the man was murdered. When I went to
him to-dayâ for I did goâ he implored me
quickly in Italian to find and bring It to
you. And obi Mademoiselle de Nevers,
he did not bid me sell It to you for a
price. That was my thought. Yet you
have promised now. Andâ Noel would
not forgive me for thisâ I cannot let you
have what I have gone through so much
to get for nothing. It was awfulâ that
roomâ the horror of itâ the stains of blood,
all the frightful disorder of . the death
struggle; everything as It had been ex
cept that the dead man lay there no long
er. I had to buy my way In; it cost me
a hundred pounds, which I had to borrow
until to-morrow; but that was nothing.
The terrible part was going Into the room.
I was not there five minutes, but it seem
ed an hour and there was the fear of be
ing caught, of having the parchment seiz
ed after I had unearthed It from among
the ashes. And the concierge waiting
outside the door, pale as death, his eyes
big and his great white face damp. Oh,
I have a right to set my own price upon
the parchment."
"I think that you have. You are a
brave girl and a loyal one," I said. "The
price I will pay. But trust me. For
Heaven's sake don't keep back the parch
ment until I have paid."
"I do trust you," she answered. "And
here Is the parchment." She whipped
from her pocket the treatyâ for I was
sure of Its Identity at a glanceâ and put
it Into my hand. To feel it in my fingers
âto know It safe, after all I had suffered;
to know, too. what Its blessed safety yet
might mean for me. was almost too much
of joy. I trembled at the touch of the
folded parchment .
"Do you know what this Is, Miss Revel
stoke?" I asked.
"No," she said. "It was your property
or Noel's. Of course Z did not open It
I tried to brush and shake the ashes
away without that"
She said the words with such pretty dig
nity, such quaint primness, that I could
have broken Into a shriek of hysterical
laughter. She had tried to clean Itâ this
thing worth nothing, yet worth millions â
this Franco-Russian Treaty I I could
have kissed her. But Instead I was going
out to keep my word. Now that I had
the parchment In my hand, ashes and all,
I could do anything.
But the danger was not half over yet I
had the healing medicine In my grasp,
yet I dared not think how many a slip
might be between the cup and lip.
"If there were still another Inducement
to offerâ to buy your help. If you will not
give It." continued Miss Revelstoke,
THE LAST HAND IN THE GREAT
GAME.
CHAPTER XIII.
The girl was shaking like a leaf, and at
my last words the tears sprang to her
eyes. She held out her hands to me.
"Thank you!" she exclaimed.
But I did not take the hands. "I do this
for him, not you," I said. "You have de
served little from me; but for the sake
of my loyal ' friendâ your loyal loverâ I
forgive you. And now I have done all I
can do. It is useless to ask more, for I
cannot do It. If you canfe to plead with
me. I am sorry that you must go away
My eyes were still reading hersâ and
the language of changing red and white
on her cheeks. "Andâ did you believe that
we were lovers?" I demanded.
"That is neither here nor there. I "
"It is much. I will not let you go away
making that mistake. I am engaged to a
man whom I love more than ail the world
besides. I would die for him. And he
would kill me If he knew that Noel Brent
was with me last night, though the busi
ness we had together was all for ray
fiance's advantage. He would never be
lieve me. because he Is. a man; yet you
will believe It, because you are a woman â
and, I think now, the woman Noel Brent
loves."
Her color answered me. "Did he tell
you so V she stammered.
v"He told me that he loved a woman. I
begin to understand. Last night was not
the first time he had sacrificed himself
for his chlvalrle idea of honor. I owe you
nothing. Miss Revelstoke, and I believe
you to have done me an Injustice of the
sort women rarely forgive. But I owe
Noel Brent much, and as far as I can re
pay the debt I will. We have never been
more than friends; we were never less
to each other than when he came to me
last night He could not tell you why he
came, nor can I; but I at least have made
no promise, which, perhaps, he did; and
I will be Imprudent enough to admit to
you that his business with me was of a
political nature. More, he was sent from
your father's houseâ not by your father,
but by a colleague of his. Ask Sir Gor
don Revelstoke from me If that be not
the truth, and say I thought his daugh
ter might be trusted with. the secret since
it concerned the man who loved her." x
The girl raised her head proudly. "You
have nothing to fear from me as a rival.
Mademoiselle de Nevers," ehe said. "Mr.
Brent and I are friends no more."
"For your sake," she put In, "he is
brave and chivalrous. If you care for
him at all it Is for you to speak. It Is the
part of a true women."
I gazed at her steadily. "If I care." I
repeated. "I see now, It Is you who care
for him."
"It wasn't a question of daring," she re
plied* simply. "I thought of him more
than of you, perhaps; but I thought of
you, too. I knew that If It were I, no
matter how much harm I did to myself,
I would tell that he had been with me. I
couldn't let him suffer and keep silence
for anything in the world."
"There are reasons why I cannot well let
It be known that he was here last night,"
I said, "though the visit was entirely one
of business. Mr. Brent knows my reasons
and approves them; therefore he has re
mained silent."
Strength came to me again as If with
an electric shock of new vitality, and I
rose confronting her. "You would dare?"
I said.
My heart had been soft to her, for her
youth and beauty's sake, but now It hard
ened. Miss Revelstoke! This girl, then,
was the British Home Secretary's daugh
ter. I knew, through a friend, that she
had been told a story against meâ a story
which was not true, and had believed It,
as butterflies of society are ready to be
lieve such stories of actresses.
"Is It possible that Mr. Brent has sent
you?" I coldly asked.
She did not answer Immediately. She
was looking at me with a strange expres
sion on her lovely face. Her eyes seemed
to question me. "I wanted very much to
see you." she said. I knew not If with
the purpose of evasion or whether she
had been too preoccupied with her own
thoughts to hear my words. "Iâ saw Mr.
Brent come to your house last night," she
went on with an effort, the blood rushing
up to her forehead. "It Is more honest to
admit that In the . beginning. I did not
dream of Bpylng uponâ either of you. It
Just happenedâ It can't interest you to
know how. But when I had seen the
papers to-day, at first I wanted to 'tell
the police or somebody that he could not
have committed the murder at the time
it must have been done, because he was
in this house."
Ipanoff bowed, and, shuddering, I let
him kiss my hand under Henri's placid
eyes. When he had gone I. plunged the
polluted fingers into the water which fill
ed a bowl of roses, and had scarcely
dried them fiercely on my handkerchief
when Henri ushered in a girl whom I did
not know, yet felt that I had seen be
foreâa beautiful, tall girl. In a gray Eng
lish tailor-made traveling dress. There
was something so lovely and lovable
about her, so true a light in the great
long-lashed gray eyes under the shining
yellow-brown hair, that the Eight of her
was welcome to me. Her presence in the
room, after the agonizing scene I had
gone through, was like a breath of fresh
air when one has been half suffocated by
some noxious gas.
I was In no condition to give a conven
tional greeting to a guest. I had dropped
into my chair again in sheer exhaustion
as Ipanoff left the room, and I could not
rise, though I made a slight effort to do
so. "Forgive me," I panted. "I am not
wellâ I am not fit to see strangers. I
would not be rude. But I confess you
were admitted as an excuse to send away
aâ troublesome person. Iâ If we have met
before Â¦ " â¢ *
"We met once or twice In London," she
broke In. In English, though I had ad
dressed her In French. "We never spoke
to each other. I am Miss Revelstoke, I
amâ a friend of Mr. Brent's."
I will acknowledge to the police that I
blundered. I know what to say to save
you, and I will say It."
"I would kill myself sooner than break
with the Comte de Rlbaumont In such a
way," I said. "Ifâ I am to give him up,
I must tell him with my own lips. This
I will do to-morrow. If I find that In the
meantime you have held your hand. You
have given me your ultimatum. This is
mine."
We looked at each other for a long mo
ment in silence. Then Ipanoff spoke.
"You swear to break with him. then?"
"If you have kept your bond."
"I will wait. I can ray no more than
thatâ I wait to test your word."
"It has never been broken."
"And afterwardâ when you are rid of
thatâ entanglement, you will be mineâ at
last. To-morrow at this time I will come
back. But understand thisâ I shall know
whether you have kept the oath you have
sworn now."
As he finished old Henri appeared at the
door. "Mademoiselle, a young lady to
see you," he announced.- "She would not
give her name, but eald her business was
of Importance."
My lips opened to answer that the lady,
whoever she was, must go away without
seeing me; but I checked myself In time.
Here was a method of ridding myself of
Ipanoff. "Her business is of importance,"
I echoed, as If I knew who my visitor
was. '"When you have shown Count Ipan
off to the door you may bring the lady
In."
"I am not afraid of youâ for myself." I
gasped. "Andâ there is nothing against
him. He has done nothingâ yet some plot
of yours may make him seem guilty. And
âand until I can explain to him I would
not have Maxime hear my name coupled
with that of Noel Brent. Give me till to
morrow to decide. To-morrow, at this
time. Do nothing till then. It Is not
long."
"No." answered Ipanoff. "I must have
my answer now. I have been patient long
enough. Give me a ring from your hand
and a letter to take to De Ribaumont
and not only will I bald my hand against
him. but my. Influence shall be used to
keep your name out of this murder case.
I can do what I promise, for It was
through me that the commissary of po
lice caught you with Brent at his hotel.
"That remains to be seen. And even so,
he may have been tricked by a woman.
Choose. Juliette. Shall he curse you as a
traitress (If, as you say, he Is a true
man), will you doom him to wear out his
life on Devils Island or some such place,
or will you let him believe you merely
fickle? You can never be his wife. Will
you be mine, and save yourself and
him?"
"Yet you Intimate that Monsieur Du
l>!eÂ«*ls has within the hour betrayed the
confidence of his client."
"Not at all. I called upon him as soon
at I learned what had happened and ex-
Pies^ed myself as extreme^ interested in
the fate of that client, whose Intimate
friends were ray friends. I even offered
to serve him in any way consistent with
ray position. Certainly. If I had not
formerly acquired a good amount of ln
..uence with Monsieur Duplessls he might
rot have trusted me even eo far as he
did. But he told me nothlnjr that could bÂ»
u?<-d to Injure the accused man. even if
my Intentions were malevolent, as my
presence here would prove that they are
r.rtâ rather the contrary."
"I do not read the proofs that way." 1
sneered. "But you have called here to tell
rr.e certain things. It will save timeâ will
<t not?â to come to the point."
"In a word. then, the point is this: One
of the most important questions asked by
the Juge d'Instructlon. after hearing
'rom Mnr.ftleur Brent an explanation of
a letter found upon him by the police â
ah. you start! The thought of a docu
ment being found upon the prisoner Is
nnt arreenble to you?"
I braced myself desperately to self-con
trol under the cruel fox-eyes which
watched me hungrily. "It may be that
Mr. Brent had a letter from me," I an
swered. "It is never agreeable to have
one's name bandied about among stran
gers, even If one Isâ an actress."
"Ah. only a letter! BÂ»t the public Is
your slave, it would forgive you any
Indiscretion, especially If the romance of
the situation Is to be Intensified by an
other avowal ruch as was made to the
commissary of police last night. There
would be few%xceptlonÂ«': yet there might
be one or two. Comte de Rlbaurribnt, for
Instance. He !Â¦ eald not to be of a for
giving disposition."
I Cinched under this blow, but I trust
not visibly. "You Interrupted yourself In
speaking of the scene with the Juge d'In
structlon," I remarked. Icily.
"To be sure â since that Interests you
more. The Important question which the
Juge d'Instructlon sprang upon the ac
cused murderer was In relation to a let
ter found upon him. It was In English.
ill-spelt, and made an appointment at the
very address where the crime was com
mitted. It was. In fact, a reauest from
a person styling himself a Jeweler's as
sistant or messenger, for the receiver of
the letter to call and return a case con
taining valuable jewels committed while
traveling from London In very eccentric
fashion to his careâ Indeed, without his
knowledge, another packet being ex
changed for itâ if I make my meaning
clear. Monsieur Brent explained this let
ter to the Juge d'Instruction by the sen
sational rtatement that his pocket had
been picked In the train of a letter-case
containing papers entirely personal, *>f no
value to any one but himself.
" "What was In the case which the mur
dered man slipped into your pockotr
asked the Juge d'Instructlon.
" 'A necklace,' answered Monsieur
Brent.
" 'A necklace of diamonds?
" They looked like diamonds.'
" 'Ah' Was this the necklace which
you gave to Mile, de Nevers at the Elysee
Palace Hotel last night?' was the nexi
question fiung suddenly at Monsler
"Am I to hear from your lips what fol
lowed according to your informant?"
Monsieur Brtnt attempted to convince
the Juge d'Instruction that, if he had
brought you a present. It had no connsc
ticn whatever with the case in hand.
'Are you not Mile, de Nevers 1 lover?' de
manded the Juge d'Instruction. 'I ad
mire her m common with thousands of
others.' was the answer. And now. ma<l
ensoiselle. do yon understand what there
Is In these questions and answers whlcu
I have repeated to bring me here to
you?"
"No. I do not," I returned steadily. Yet
I did begin to see what might be In that
scheming mind of his.
"Then I must speak dearly and, above
all. frankly. Comte de Ribaumont Is your
lover. You hope, perhaps, to marry him.
But he Is a proud man. He will have all
or nothing; and he would never take fcr
bis wife a woman who accepted diamond*
from another, boldly avowing them the
gift of love."
"He would not believe It of a woman
he loved!" I cried, almost repeating my
words of last nightâ as I remembered in
uttering them now.
"I know a way to make him. believe.
Oh. I shall not tell him! He shall see all
that passed between Monsieur Brent and
the Juge d'Instructlon In writing un
less^â"
"Unless whatT"
"Unless you give him vp and put In his
place a man who adores you as he never
has and never willâ as no other man
can."
I sprang from my chair as Ipanoff flung
me his ultimatum, and he also leaped to
his feet. Would that the lightning in my
eyes could have burnt his black heart!
â¢â¢Tigress!" he exclaimed, under my look.
"Beautiful tigress. You cannot kill me
with your eyes. Would your Count de
Rlbaumont love you If he knew you for
wfcat you are? Yet Iâ I would love you
if you were a murderess Instead of a
spy." J
"It Is yon who are a spy!" I panted.
"Then, If I am, I have not spied in vain.
Not only can I rein you with Rlbaumont,
but I *â¢*" ruin him with the world.".
"Noâ no!" I barely articulated. "You
boast of what you cannot perform."
"Not at the moment, perhaps. I had^
not proof enough at first of what I sus^
pected; but this affair of Brent has
played zny game. Its complications are
links for my chain. In one way be was
distinctly unfortonate. Dubols, the detec
tive, was the very man I had sent to
England to watch the Foreign Secretary
for a certain reason. He followed Brent
to Paris en suspicion, and It was while he
was actually preparing a report for me
that Brent called to engage him In his
own affair. ? strange coincidence, was It
not?"
"Nothing will be missing," I breathed.
"Maxime de Rlbaaxnont U a man of
honor.
For a moment Maxime spoke In a low
voice with a young man at the door., Then
Instinctively my fingers tightened on
the scrap of paper. I drew back hastily.
Maxime pushed the door of the safe, shut
and locked It, and when' he called "En
trez!" I was at the other end of the
room In a chair meant for visitors. My
bag in which I had brought the treaty)
was open, and I had In my hand a tiny
mirror, before which I was adjusting my
hair with a confused and coquettish look.
This It Is to have been an actress half
one's life!
"Give It to mÂ© then."
"Ah! but that is not what I want to
do. Oh! Maxime, be kind to me. Give
me my own way, just this once, to atone
for last night. It Â¦will atone. Let me
put the note I have written for you In
your safe, among the great and Import
ant state documents which you gave me
a peep at the other day. Mine Is as im
portant as they, I promise you; but I
shall not believe you think it so unless
you let me lay it there, not to be read
until I have left you."
â¢ "Is the news good or bad?" he demand
ed. "Jf it is bad. I will not wait in sus
pense. I will hear It now from you."
"It Is good v " I said.
"Then It can wait, for I have you now â
that is enough of good at one time."
"But it cannot wait to be put in the
post-box," I cried, pushing him away
when he would have taken me In his
arms, and laughing nervously. "Am I to
have my way?"
"There need be no great difficulty in
that," laughed Maxime, "since you are
you. and I know that I could trust you
with my soul." ~
Oh, how the words hurtâ though I loved
him for them I
He opened the safe from which I had
stolen the treaty with a quickness which
would have seemed to himâ If he had
knownâ sleight of hand. But now I was
trembling all over and terribly afraid of
bungling at the last. His loving eyes hurt
my face. I laid one' band over them.
"Don't look at me like that," X whispered,
"or I shall tell you and spoil my plan."
With my palm softly pressing down his
eyelids, as he held open the door of the
safe, I kissed him full upon his lips with
a long, long kiss. And kissing him I laid
the treaty where I had found it. So great
was the relief when It left my fingers that
I could have fallen Into weeping. But I
only sighed as I kissed my lover, and
was In the act of dropping the twice
folded note I had written in the carriage
Into the safe, where Maxime would be
sure to see it, when there was a knock at
the door. -^V V;
"It was only to say that I have no news
of the necklace, though I have done all
that I can. I do not deserve to see you
after my hateful conduct last night and
my brutal carelessness, which is costing
us both so much. Yet I was going to ask
If I might come to you after the theater
to-night. 6hall I send your telegram for
you, and then we can go to the office,
since you are so good, so exquisitely for
giving?"
Send the telegram! Lightning shot
through me at the thought, yet I forced a
6mile. "No, I thank you, dear one," I
said quietly, "since it concerns a surprise
for you, I do not wish to have It spoiled."
(Which was true, If ever I spoke the
truth.) - *
I drove him back to the Foreign Office
â lt;was not five minutes' driveâ and for
tunately because! looked pale and my
eyes showed sleeplessness, Maxime for
got In his loving anxiety for my well
being to ask what brought me to him.
I wished to leave the explanation until
we had arrived, t*-at I might try my
plan.
As soon as we were In Maxime's office,
and alone together, I said: "Have you no
curiosity as to why I came?"
"I hoped it was because you longed to
see me a hundredth part as much, per
haps, as I to see you," he answered.
"It was partly that, and partly some
thing else," I returned, smiling at him
with eyes full of love and longingâ long-
Ing for the happy calm which might be
ours after storms If onlyâ only all went
well within the next hour. "I have news
for you," I went on. "I want you to
learn it In a certain way, not from my
lips, but from something I have written."
"You have written me a letter?" he
asked.
"A very little one,"
"I went to you at the office," I said,
my voice trembling a little. "You were
not there, so I came to send a wire. Now,
if you will, we can go back together.
You shall tell me what you were mean-
Ing to telegraph. That will be better."
I dreaded to learn my fate. "Was the
Comte de Rlbaumont In?" I asked. He
was notâ and down went my heart. But
he was expected back again, as he had
an appointment a little later. In ten min
utes, perhaps, he would return. There
was still hope for to-day, then!
I would not wait, but left word that I
also in ten minutes would be back for a
word with the Comte de Ribaumont.
There was another card now to be
played, since the ace must wait. I drove
to the nearest telegraph office, and had
written out the message which I wished
to send, when a voice well known and
loved spoke close behind me.
â¢'Juliette!" exclaimed Maxime. "I had
Just come to 'telegraph to you. And now
I find you!"
I turned with a start, laying my hand
over the telegraph form on which Count
Ipanoff's name and address were written,
also these words: "I have changed my
mind. You need wait no longer. All
stands as before. Do what you choose.â
J. de N."
My purse has a notebook attachment,
with a tiny gold pencil held by a ribbon
loop. I wrote a few linesâ shakily, as the
wheels traveled fastâtore out the leaf,
folded into a tiny square, and slipped It
Into my glove. Three minutes later my
carriage drew up before the Foreign Of
fice.
Suddenly, however, an Inspiration came
to roeâ a plan by which I might Induce
Mm to unlock the safe door for me.
The fear of finding him gone was so
absorbing that I could scarcely collect
my thoughts; but I must think, and
clearly.
I had got the treaty in the first place
by a ruse; but what excuse could I make
to-day to wheedle Maxime again Into
opening the safe from which I purloined
It? Even a lover would scarcely be so
good-naturedly reckless of his trust for a
second time.
could yet be right? Could I cave himâ
and myself for him?
I had in my hand the ace of trumps
for that desperate game in which I had
staked Maxime's honor and my happi
ness. Miss Revelstoke held another high
trump for me (strange that they should
both come back through her!), but all
the other trumps, and many a good card
besides, were still the enemy's. Every
thing depended now on, the way the next
hand was played, and it was I who must
lay down the first card.
I had ordered my coachman to drive
fast, for if I missed Maxime It would be
too late to replace the treaty In the safe
to-day, while who could tell what to
morrow might bring forth? and I might,
too, easily miss him at this hour. It was
but a chance that he/ might still be at
the office.
"Not even to get back the Jewels, whose
loss was the beginning of all our misfor
tune. Noel Brent would not wish me to
sacrifice myself. His silence shows thatâ
and It shall not have been in vain. He
must be saved without me."
"Somethingâ yes."
â¢Then you know, perhaps, that It Is of
great value. Can you give him informa
tion which would help him to find it?"
"I might give you the Information. But
for a reward. A finder Is always entitled
to a reward. That which I ask for Is
your promise to save Noel Brent."
"I tell you I cannot," I cried. "Youâ
surely you do not demand a bribe?"
"A reward. I know where the thing Is
which was lost and to-morrow it can be
In your hands, if you will do what I Im
plore. Tell the police that Noel Brent

mitted."
disappointed. But I am tired and 111. It
would be better for us both to part now."
"I came for more than to plead," the
girl persisted. "That was only the begin
ning. I won't keep you long. But there
are two things I must say before I go.
You yourself would wish it. For oneâ
that photograph In the frame of brilliants
âIs it a friend of yours V *
She was pointing to a photograph of
Maxima which stood on my writing desk.
"Yes," I answeredâ for I saw no reason
to hide the truth from her. "A deer
friend. One for whomâ If necessaryâ I
would sacrifice all others."
"Pardon me for asking," said Miss Rev
elstoke. "It was because he lost some
thing last night." -
"And you know something of it?" I
caught her up quickly, taking a step to
ward her.
As he clasped me the world outside
faded away. I forgot that I had been
all my life a woman who dared. Z was
nowâ I am nowâ only a woman who loves,
and has more than she deserves.
(THE END.)
"I have listened to Ipanoff for the last
time," said Maxime. "That dogl He
had better not speak evil of you!"
"I hope he will see that It is useless,"
I answered. "I am so tired of storms. I
want loveâ and peaceâ and you."
"You shall have allâ and for always."
said Maxime.
But the necklace " I breathed. "You
will be glad to have It again? A lovely
girl will give It to you to-morrow. 8he
Is to marry my old friend Noel Brent
who Is accused of murder here in Paris.
She was here last night, and her lover,
too; they found the necklace which Noel
Brent himself had got back from the
thief, who was murdered, but not by
him. She will explain: I could not have
told you. as It was not a conventional
proceeding for her. No one knows but
myself, and now you and one other,
Ipanoff- If he ever tries to make you
believe lies of me and Noel Brent, you
will understand now how little truth
there Is In them, since he adores another
woman, almostâ but not Quiteâ as I
adore you."
The traitor Ipanoff had managed that
trick somehow. He must have meant all
along to win over my promise and de
ceive me. ruining Maxime; though he
would have vowed. If anything in the safe
had been missing and Maxime disgraced,
that he had had nothing to do with it.
The fear of the terrible man, who had so
nearly checkmated me, came over me
again.
"You mean that, thank heaYeo. you
were too late, don't you?" he corrected
me. He was thinking of the note; I was
thinking of something elsel But when I
heard his Innocent remark I gratefully
assented.
"Thank heaven that I was not too later*
I had cried out before I knew what I was
saying.
"That tiresome fallow who parted ns!"
he exclaimed, when I was In his arms.
"He was gone In fifteen minutes. Butâ
it Is Just as well you were prevented from
putting your precious little note about the
finding of the necklace Into the safe ac
cording to your whim, for the man came
with an order from the President to copy
a cltCuse In the Franco-Russian treaty,
which is kept there. It would have been
rather awkward when I opened the safe
to take out the treaty If your note had
tumbled out. It wouldn't have looked
exactly official r*
this Comte de Ribaumont was announced.
I was obliged to force Mr. BTent to con
ceal himself In my boudoir, which he re
luctantly did; and I can prove to you by
one of my servants, if you do not care
to take my word alone, that he was not
able to escape until nearly half-past 1. He
could not have called twice in the Rue
de la Tour, as the papers say that the
concierge believed, for he was in my bou
doir. How he found the address of the
man he suspected as the thief I cannot
tell you "
"We already know that. It was through
a letter."
"Ah!" (I made the exclamation Inno
cently as if I did not remember all I had
heard from Count Ipanoff.) "Now, you
see why he went to the house. It was to
get my letters which he hoped to find
there. And you see also why he has kept
my name out of the affair, refusing to
compromise me even to save himself great
trouble, perhaps danger. How could he
ruin my happiness when he knew that 1
had lied to the Comte de Rlbaumont. say
ing: that I was alone?"
"It see. And I applaud his chivalry."
said the chief of police.
"You are the man to understand it.

he be released? It is clearâ Is It not?
that the murder must have been dom.
long before the time when he could have
reached the Rue de la Tour after leaving
my house at 1:30."
"That is clear. There are still certain
formalities to be gone through before the
accused man can be released; but I may
as well Inform you, dear mademoiselle,
that not ten minutes before you came in
I received news of the arrest of two men
â one an Englishmanâ who are believed to
be concerned in this strange affair. They
certainly traveled with the murdered man
from England yesterday, and a friend of
his named Poisson, Just returned from
Marseilles (It was In Poisson's room the
murder was committed), haj given Infor
mation regarding these two persons and
their late association as partners with the
deceased, which throws grave suspicion
on them. If the man Jackson who has
been murdered stole the necklace you
speak of from the Comte de Rlbaumont.
with this pair as his accomplices, and
afterward endeavored to cheat them out
of their share of the booty a motive for
the crime Is easily evident. You have
helped Monsieur Brent bravely. Made
moiselle de Nevers, and I hope that In a
day or two he himself may be able to
thank you. You have supplied all the
missing links."
"I am gladâ glad!" I exclaimed. "And
must I suffer for what I have done for
him with the man I love?"
"No. dear mademoiselle; I will see that
you do not. The Comte de Rlbaumont
need never know the circumstances as
you have to!d them to me. or that the
Englishman's alibi has been proved by
you. The arrest of these others will
make It easy for the police to keep the
secret. Now, will that assurance render
your heart lighter on the stage to-night?"
"You shall see, if you will accept a
box," I said. And I let him press my
hand. Then I drove home. Hardly had I
reached there when Maxime came.
"He came under another name."
"Because, It arrears, he Is engaged to
be married also within the last few days,
and wished to keep his meeting with me
a 6ecret- I only learned that last night."
"He came to you after calling at the
house of the British Home Secretary In
London. He was seen to enter there by
a private detective, and though he cer
tainly was not seen coming out, he must
have done so, as he was In Paris in the
evening."
"But It Is to the daughter of the British
Home Secretary that he Is engaged; and
Bhe, too, is in Parts now. She came, I
think, a little later, and with friends, so
that the situation was dangerous for him.
You say you know what happened at the
hotel, but I will explain the Inner mean
ing of It. Mr. Brent was to have
brought me my letters. He gave me a
letter case, saying they were In it; at
that instant the lights went out. whether
by design or accident I don't know."
"It was not design on the part of the
police," the chief interrupted. "It hap
pened, it appears, all over the % hoteL"
"When the case was opened by the
commissary of police, and I saw the dia
monds, I was much surprised; the more
so as they had been stolen from the
Comte Rlbaumont a few days ago. Again
I confide In you as a man of honor. They
were the property of a dear friend, an
elderly lady well known In Paris, who Is
an inveterate gambler, but a charming
woman.
"She dared not tell her husband of her
losses, but begged Maxime to sell the
jewels for her In Amsterdam and have
them replaced with paste. On his way
there to carry out this mission the neck
lace was stolen from him. You can Im
agine his state of mind and my surprise
on seeing It reappear In io extraordinary
a way. I believed that somehow Noel
Brent had recovered It; and it wu only
to keep my letters (which I had not yet
received) out of the affair, and also the
Comte de Rlbaumont's name In connec
tion with the diamonds, that I told the
commissary of i police that the necklace
was a gift from my lover. The Instant I
had spoken the words I regretted them,
for fear of consequences, but lt.wu then
too late. '
"When the police had gone I asked Mr.
Brent for my letters. He said he thought
he had given them to me; and he knew
no more of the diamonds than I didâ far
less, indeed.
"I was In despair at discovering . that
my letters were gone, though I was
thankful, for the Comte de Rlbaumont's
sake, to have the necklace, which since
I have given to ~*m. Mr. Brent believed
that the letters must have been stolen
from him In the train, though he could
not account for the presence of the jewels
in his pocket: but as he suspected a man
who had traveled with him, he determined
to try and find him, promising to bring
news to my house after the theater at 12
o'clock.
"He came a little later, having been de
tained with friends at the hotel till mid
night. One of these friends was Miss
Revelstoke. He had employed a private
detective named Dubols, but had learned
nothing yet and, while he was telling me
"In England I had what might be called
a slight flirtation with Noel Brent, who la
popular In society. We exchanged letters,
which were a little foolishâ nothing more.
Yet when I became engaged to the Comte
de Rlbaumont, only a short time ago (It
was to have remained a secret until next
year, on account of my professional en
gagement), I was distressed that such let
ters should be In another man's posses
sion. I would not be satisfied with being
told that they were burnt, at my request.
I wrote and asked Mr. Brent to bring me
the letters and I would meet him at the
Elysee Palace Hotel to take them from
him."
"You say he could not possibly have
committed It, dear mademoiselle T' smiled
the chief. "You are a stanch partisan."
"But Mr. Brent was at my house when
the murder was committed." I said quick
ly, it Is hard for me to come and tell
you this, because If the Comte de Rlbau
mont, to whom I am engaged, should
come to know it, he would not easily for
give me. Monsieur Blanchard. if I tell
you the whole truth frankly, cannot you
save me from exposure, yet at the same
time free the man whose Innocence I can
prove to you? It would kill me to break
with the Comte de Rlbaumont,"
"Dear mademoiselle, trust me to do the
best for you." said the chief, moved al
ready, as I could see, by the tears In my
eyes and the touch of my hand on bis
arm. "You have been frank. I will be
equally so. I should have communicated
with you on the subject of the accused
Eugllshman, as I was aware of what took
place between you at the hotel, but I re
ceived a reauest from a very high quar
ter Indeed to hold my hand for the mo
ment. How comes It, If you are engaged
to the Comte de Ribaumont, that you
made the statement you did at the Elysee
Palace concerning this Monsieur Brent?"
"It Is that which I have come to tell
youâ that, and much besides," I answer
ed. "I'll throw myself upon your mercy.
\ou shall have all my confidence:
A gallant man is the chief of police I
His first words to me were In congratu
lation upon my success It the new play
last night. This gave me the cue I
wished for. It was well. I said, that I
had not to act the part for the first
time to-night, or I should fear to dis
grace myself, so much anxiety had I
suffered since seeing the papers and
reading what had happened to a friend
of mine who was accused of a murder
which he could not possibly have com
mitted.
My brain was clearer nowâ now that
the treaty was In the safe at the Foreign
Officeâ and I could think. On my way
to the chief of police I devised a story
which should render one of the enemy's
trump cards useless. It would depart but
little from the truth; and, thanks to the
revelations made to me In malice by
Ipanoff, it would exactly fit In with the
tale which Noel Brent had told to the
Juge d'Instructlon. It would. In fact,
supplement his.
I was sure of an audience with the
chief of police, who Is a gentleman and
a patron of the theaterâ when he finds
time.
the young man went away, and In an In
stant returned to usher Into the room an
elderly, official-looking personage.
If only 1 could have escaped two min
utes sooner! But there was no actual In
discretion In my being here, with my car
riage waiting at the door. I rose, bade
Maxime adieu in a formal manner and
slipped Into his hand the note which I
had intended to put into the safe.
"At 7, then, Monsieur le Comte," I
added, as If I reminded him of an. ap
pointment; and I knew that he would
take it so. He would come to my house,
and I should see him for a few minutes
before leaving for the theater. Then I
.would tell him what I had hoped to tell
him now â about the beautiful English
girl who had called upon meâ the fiancee
of my friend Noel Brent. That would
pave the way for Miss Revelstoke, and
help me to make him believe in me If
Count Ipanoff tried to take such re
venge as lay still In his power.
Then I had to goâ there was nothing
else for me to do. And at last I had
time to keep my promise to Miss Revel
stoke.

THE ORACLE OF

CENTER
By S. E. Kiser.
PwniBMBm E hear an awful lot of talk about \
Â¦ SFSP^&r^Sfl l^ c sc tt~ assert Â» v< ?h css Â°f the woman \
Ifc2i S^uS/ExE wJl Â° ' vvor^ s ' * >ut * confess that in my
IliviU^ ui^*H o P' n iÂ° n Â£ he ' s often more sinned <
l*r^^J$rt.l course, there are all sorts and |
1 ficSs's^iSia H kinds of people, but women who .
IkanBBBUKaal ' iave had to learn in a measure the
lesson of self-control are apt to be re-'
flcctors of the treatment they receive. !
About the hardest lot that can befall one woman js the 1
necessity of having to work for another, and this is the >
rtason that servants so frequently rebel. A woman is more *
petty, enters more into details and will make fewer allow- '
auces for another than will a man. Besides, while a man
ir.ay swear and get so mad that he can hardly contain him
self, yet his bluster will blow over and a woman can laugh
at it and his exhibitions of temper, while the cool, in
cisive jab of another woman would set her wild. If you
let a man alone, giving him time to blow off his pent-up
tteam, he will simmer and sizzle down most beautifully, but
rot so a woman; she wiil keep it up and chew the rag for
cays at a dead stretch. '
A man will get mad and say a lot of real bad words, but
he nvill not become personal, while a woman will reap up
all that she knows, good, bad or doubtful, that another wo
man ever did or did not do from her cradle up.
One very funny case, where a man whose business makes \
him rather dependent on his stenographer, has a little way '
of discharging her every time that he gets ruffled. The
next morning she as regularly appears at her desk and tells,
rum that she will only stay until he finds some one to take
her place. He blusters and tells her that he won't have
her around, when the fact is that he would be at a dreadful '
loss were she to take him seriously.
On one occasion she did absent herself for several days,
when he took a carriage and went after her himself. Wo
man-like, she forced him to gulp down huge lumps of hum
ble pie before she consented to return. '
Now, under such circumstances, a woman would act so
petty telling the other about seventeen times a day that
she "was glad enough to get back" that the position would '
be unbearable; while this girl has sense enough to know 1
that she has sized him up most perfectly and understands
him so well that it would be a hard matter for him to re
place her. Then, too, a woman hates to make a change
after she has once been broken in to a man's ways.
The most pitiful woman among those forced to earn a
livelihood are the women who havc seen better days. t
Such women are, as a rule.^-ery helpless until misfortune >
develops them; meanwhile it is a bitter task to become as- ]
similated to surroundings. The lesson is a hard one to '
learn, and is taken to heart through a pathway of tears. \
People seem to resent the intrusion of a refined woman t
who seeks work, and such a one is treated with a coldness >
amounting to incivility. ]
A refined woman who finds herself suddenly confronted '
with the problem of self-support merits all the graciousness \
that good breeding accords, and yet she seldom receives it.
Rich women dislike dealing with such a one, giving the <
excuse that it is embarrassing to give orders to one whom (
they cannot but acknowledge an equal both by birth and |
breeding. This may be very true, as there can be no ques- ,
tion that the employed is often far superior to the employer,
which should be to her credit, but it surely is never to her'
advantage. Let such a one try to make use of any accora- I
plishment or skill in certain lines, and the richer the woman \
patron the meaner is she apt to be when it comes to the,
question of compensation.
Many of us have heard women abundantly blessed with '
this world's goods unblushingly boast of the pittance paid (
for some exquisite piece of workmanship done by the wo- \
man who must rely upon her skill for a living, and the cold- <
blooded manner in which a woman tells laughingly of such ]
bargains is little less than shame. '
Women work either through necessity or the love of in- 1
dependence, but a woman of refinement would never work!
for other women unless it were a question of direst ncces- 1
tity.
When I hear women discussing the incivility of shopl
girls I am constrained to think that if they would stand for (
an hour or so at a shop counter and listen to the arrogant /
rudeness of shoppers and note the total absence of consid- ]
eration, thcy would feel sorry for the girl rather than for'
the shoppers. If one approaches one of these tired standing <
women, who are not allowed to sit down during the hours {
cf labor, politely and with a smile, they are very apt to be i
met with an answering smile. *
If you have a penchant for studying character, watch one^
of these girl's faces as women file up to be waited on. {
One woman approaches with a supercilious hard-cash air {
and gives her order as if afraid of microbes or some other |
dark and yellow contagion. The girl is polite and obliging. !
Then there looms in sight another who perhaps is equally'
well groomed, but wears a pleasant smile with her good <
clothes, and immediately the girl's face is transfigured. The \
las* woman sits at the counter, leans over, and while the girl t
displays samples of her wares she tells her some pleasing ;
anecdote, and the girl looks perfectly happy, as if an electric {
light had been turned on beyond the wall of her face and<
shone through it.
Now, I do not think it lessens a woman's dignity, no
matter who or what she may be, or how much cold cash
she may command, to be pleasant to these tired little
women, who earn more than they will ever get this side
of heaven. Many of them are little less than angels, or
they would not be able to cope with the purse-proud, dis
agreeable women who file in with their noses in the air as
if sniffing an abattoir rather than seeking pretty things in
a busy mart
And the newspaper woman. Let us pray for her.
At a recent large public function my chojer was aroused
by the rude snubbing of some women anent the pretty little '
representative of a local paper. She timidly approached'
seme ladies in quest of names and descriptions of the hand- \
some gowns -worn. Being a stranger myself, it was im- ,
possible to assist her, but the rudeness of one woman
aroused me to champion her at all hazards.
"Don't bother with her," said one matron who figures '
largely in philanthropic schemes.
, "Look here," I put in, "that child has her living to make 1
and she must turn in her story to-night before the morning
paper goes to press. If she does not get it she will probably
lose her job."
The woman seemed rather ashamed then of her rude-'
ness and called the girl back, treating her very graciously,!
and she got her story all right.
Now, while newspaper work is very fascinatin< in the
main, yet the reporter of the lociety column often has a
pretty hard time of it. When sent out she must get her 1
story, and if she does not the editor will tell her very plainly 1
that if she cannot he must find some one who can. Conse
quently she is entirely dependent on the courtesy and good
breeding of the ladies for information that she must obtain.
If she is refined she is often hurt to the quick and snubbed'
by women who cannot hold a candle to her either, in brains 1
or breeding, and her very culture . makes her more sensitive
to slights. It is a very trifling matter for a society matron
to treat such a one with courtesy when she is often glad
enough to race after the editor, begging for notice to ad- 1
vertise her pet schemes. She would feel highly indignant 1
xtere she refused, yet she will try to snub the girl who rep
resents his paper. Unless one has known society people so
cially, the lot of the society reporter is not enviable by
any means. . - ...
-- - Â¦ - HE remarkable fact has just been
&7!D C^teS notc^ that within a short time two
Wf/n f?0^1 great missionary organizations whose
Hi IN If Ib9 operations cover the whole of the
|k\\l] WJMi Unit . cd . States have selected as their
KÂ»So L^hIh administrative heads men over 60 years
KSg>Â» fairaBqjfl of age. The action has caused sur
â-Â¦ prise in some quarters, because the
modern business world, and especially
the modern ecclesiastical world, does not appear to have
a surplus of remunerative positions for men who have
passed the three-score milestone. In my judgment, 'one
great reason why they were selected in . preference to;
many younger competitors is that they possess a cer
tain elasticity and sprightliness of spirit arid a great
fund of cheerfulness. It has shone in their faces for
many years and carried uplift to all who have come in
contact with them. In the language of the street, their
cheerfulness is a part of their stock in trade.
Once a week I go to a club where the young man in
charge of the coat room is a polite, capable, well appearing
fellow. But he carries about with him an atmosphere of
gloom from whose effects I do not recover for, several min
utes after my brief business with him. To my feeble at
tempts to open conversation he replies in monosyllables and
with averted gaze. I am confident that were I on a board
of directors considering his claims to promotion, I should
ask "Why in the world is he so desperately morose? Is.
not'this trait going to handicap him all his life?" .
Making due allowance for inherited and temperamental
tendencies, I nevertheless make bold to assert that cheer
fulness can be cultivated just as easily and' to just T as great
an extent as muscle- or memory. There is no event or inci
dent of life from which it is impossible to ' extract some!
reason for cheerfulness or hope. , Try the experiment to
morrow morning. See if : there cannot be put -a favorable
and an inspiring construction upon everything that- befalls
you, or at least upon nine-tenths of the matters that make
up the warp and woof of the day. If you can look at them
cheerfully, if you can interpret them in a way to make
yourself and those about you happier, then it is foolish, nay,
wicked, for you to see only the distressing elements in the
situation and to brood over them until all the joy and glory
have vanished from the day. . Â¦
More than such an attitude as that, . I honor the cool
bravado of the man/ who, when things look bad. says satiri
cally to himself arid his friends, "Cheer up, fellows, the
worst is yet to come." Butv the. truth is in most cases the
worst is not to come; worse may have already come to
worst and from now on there is to be a turn in the tide. At
least that is" a good working hypothesis anyway, and it
may serve to keep a man steady and hopeful when he seems
to be altogether hemmed in. ;
.Deliver, me, however, from a mechanical kind of cheerful
ness. No automatic smile, no forced gayety can take the
place or accomplish the work of the inward joy. I remem
ber that on one of those rare occasions in my, life when I
visited the theater, the hero and the heroine in the play
had a temporary disagreement. They parted in high
drdgeon and. the. girl, after he left, went to the piano and
sang sobbingly a song whose refrain was "Oh. I am so
happy, I am so happy." The audience roared of course.
And the great discerning wc-ld will always see through the
person who puts -on a mask of cheerfulness. In the long
run he will deceive nobody but himself.
And I ambound to say in this "connection, not because I
am a parson," but; because I believe it with all my heart,
that theone great, source of unfeigned and abiding cheer
fulness is religion. -To believe that there is a God and that
He is near and fatherly and forgiving, that He holds our
lives and the lives of ;the whole human family in his own
wise and tender keeping,. and .that under, his guidance the
lives'of all of us may. move on to happy issuesâ how such a
faith begets and nourishes cheerfulness in a man. Phillips
Brooks once said to a great congregation in Trinity-Church.
Boston, "Oh, never "'despair of a world over, which God
rules." Blest indeed is he who in the "darkest night can
trust this power, for if he does cherish such" a trust, the
morning will find him with a smile on his face.
ULBERRY CENTER, June 291â Our
mmmmmmmmmu Â¦ nq carpenters have went on a strike and
/L-jÂ£-Sn *h e town seems a Rood deal like a fun
/tfj^kjJS* eral. I haven't been able to find out
IIIELHMlm exactly what's the matter with ths
I &*^T H boyS) but thcy havc my sympathy - Its
I (uLJLJsyj |B the fashion to always give people on a
strike your sympathy. Sometimes
other things would do them more
good, but sympathy's better than nothin', and if there's
anything that the average citizen who ain't neither one of
the downtrodden millions nor yet a member of the bloated
aristocracy has plenty of it's good, plain, old, everyday
sympathy.
Sometimes I can't hardly help wondering where us
common people that don't belong to unions and ain't mem
bers of any of the trusts get a show that's worth men
tionin*. When times are hard and prices a^ "cheap we're
s'posed to get out and whoop for the return of prosper
ity so the business interests can shove up the cost of
things. I don't blame the business interests for wantin'
high prices, mind you, ncr the laborin' men for askin' for
higher wages. That's all right so fur as they are con
cerned, but where do us people that stand between the cap
italists and the laborers come in? We don't get any more
money than we had when times was hard, and they make
us pay about three times as much for everything we cat
and wear and have done.
Still we're s'posed to yell for joy because the glad old
prosperous days are back again. And we do it without a
kick. When the tailors strike to have their share of the
prosperity, which they'd' never git if they just waited
around for capital to hand it to them, it's our duty to keep
from comolainin' if the two sides that's fightin* each other
over our heads happen to hit us a few good hard welts now
and then. We can't blame capital, because we all have
the good sense to realize that without the capitalists thU
country would be like a wheelbarrow without the whceL
So we respect the pusiness interests and stand up loy
ally for their protection. But at the same time we know
the laborer is worthy of his hire. If he didn't alwav* take
it into his head to go to the polls and vote every time there's
an election troin* on mebby we wouldn't think he was so
blamed worthy of his hire. But we must be careful to keen
his waees up while our party is in power or he'll vote for
the other side the next time. If we let him do that we
would be traitors to our glorious country, the land of the
free and the' home of the brave, where everybody but peo
ple who work for salaries and don't belong to unions or
combines stands a fair show.
So we must stand up for the protection of capital and
sympathize with labor. Uncle Mark can tell you how to
do itN Sometimes I can't hardly understand the way it
works. Capital always has to stand up for principle by
refusin' to grant labor's demands. Then labor strikes, and
after a long, hard fight that makes lots of trouble for a
good many people who are not to blame, labor gives in.
Sometimes it seems to me as though principle mizht have
been stood up for iust as well by lettin' the men have what
they wanted at the start. But of course us common plugs
of citizens that^stand between the two fighting classes
can't expect to see through these things. After capital has
fought till the stock of goods it had on hand is all eone
it gets ti'-ed standing up for principle and r_ises prices so
us peoole that do the buying will have to make uo what
was lost by the delay. The extra that the strikers eit in
wages is expected to be furnished by us, too, and it's
never expected in vain. - ; ;'
So we whoop for joy because the trouble is settled at
last and prosperity has come once more to the community,
and at the same time cuttin' ourselves down to a meal and
a half a day so the children won't need to eo naked. It's
terrible srlorious. We praise the ttrikers because they
struck for their rights, we stand up for capital because we
can't deny that it has the right to run its business to
suit itself, and we git clubbed from both sides and pre
tend we like it
Here is my brother-in-law, Joe Parker, gittin' a new
house built with money he's been savin' up for about
twenty-seven years. The strikers have struck, not because
they have anything 1 agin Joe, but a contractor over in one
of the adjoinin' counties didn't'treat his men right and a
general tie-up's been ordered to punish him. Toe ex
pected to eit into his new home next week and give uo the
house he'd been rentin'. If his place is finished by Christ
mas he'll be in luck. Between now and the time he can
move in he must take his family to some boardin* house
or hotel, so it'll cost him about four times what it would
to keen house. I met him yesterday and hÂ« was lookin'
kind of blue.
"Joe." says I. "you must take 1 lensible rtcw of this
thing. There's no doubt in my- mind that the contractor
who started this trouble is a mighty mean man tnd de
serves what he's gettin'."
*t. " l u k ? O , w ,-, U -" s * J s .7? e * .â¢cratcbin' his head kind of

Sometimes I almost wish we didn't have strikes in this
country." u
â¢ "Can it be possible,- I says, "that you are sidin' in with
the^ plutocrat against giyin* the workin'man his rights?"
"No. no." savs Toe, gettin' scared and lookin' around to
see if anybody-happened to hear us. "You know blamed
well that although I always vote to uphold the business in
terests of the country I am in favor of givin' the laborin'
man the highest wages in the history of our splendid re
public. Don't tell anybody I complained, because I don't
want to be looked down on as an enemy to the business
interests or the labor element of the community. That
contractor had to stand out" for principle, and of course it
would of been a fatal blow to labor if the men had sub
mitted to his terms. So I stand up for one side and ap
prove of what has been done by the other. Thank heaven
I am still a loval citizen ever ready to sympathize with the
downtrodden masses and demand that capital shall be fullv
protected." ; : ..._
ThereVonly one class of peoole in this country that
don t get any sympathy and can't command respect
That s us who are between the two fightin' elements and
have to take knocks from both sides. It shows what or
ganization will do. The other fellows are organized.
We am t. and that s what's the matter with us. If we had
a union or something for self-protection and the advance
ment of our own interests maybe they'd ask what we
thought of it once in a while before sroin* ahead and
dom things that rmke it disagreeable and costly for us-
What we need is hard times with low prices and our sal
aries and incomes left as they are. Here's what our
minister thinks about it:
The men below and the men tbova *
Fight on day after day, " _
And when they'll cease to knock and prod
No mortal man can say.
But it isn't the ones above who feel
The sharpest, keenest woes.
And it isn't the ones below who reel
From the hardest, heaviest blows.
Between the ones at war there stands
A great and patient horde
That gets it from both sides at once
How long, how long, O Lord?

CHEERFULNESS AS AN ASSET.
By "Tf)c Parson."
Â¦ i EAR PIERREPONT: Of course you're in no position yet to think of being en-
Jjâ¢ 3 **!?! gaged even, and that's why I'm a little afraid that you may be planning to get mar
g r$|svÂ§ ried. But a twelve-dollar clerk, who owes fifty-two dollars for roses, needs a
I sUlP " keeper more than arvvife. I want to say right here that there always comes a time
JÂ«Jj^*^^ to tke fellow who blows fifty-two dollars at a lick on roses when he thinks how
â LI - many staple groceries he could have bought with the money. After all, there's
no fool like a, young fool, because in the nature of things he's a long time to live.
I suppose I'm fanning the air when I ask you to be guided by my judgment in this matter,
because, while a young fellow will consult^ his father about buying a horse, he's cocksure of him
self when it comes to picking a wife. Marriages may be made in heaven, but most engagements are
made in the back parlor, with the gas so low that a fellow doesn't really get a square look at what
he's talking to. While a man doesn't see much of a girl's family when he's courting, he's apt to see a
good deal of it when he's housekeeping; and while he doesn't marry his wife's father, there's nothing
in the marriage vow to prevent the old man "from borrowing \money from him, and you can bet 'if
he's old Job Dashkam he'll do it. A man can't pick his own mother, but he can pick his son's
mother, and when he chooses a father-in-law who plays the bucket shops he needn't be surprised if
his own son plays the races. * f
Never marry a poor girl who's been raised like a rich one. She's simply traded the virtues of
the poor for the vices of the rich without going long on their good points. To marry for money or
to marry without money is a crime. There's no real objection to marrying a woman with a for
tune, but there is to marrying a fortune with a woman. Money, makes the mare go, and it makes
her cut up, too, unless she's used to it and you drive her with a snaffle bit."
While you are at it, there's nothing-like. picking out a good-looking wife, because even the
handsomest woman looks homely sometimes,? and f so -you .get, a Jittle variety; but a homely one can
only look worse than usual. Beauty is only skin deep, but that's deep enough to satisfy any reason
able man. (I want to say right here that to get any sense out of a proverb I usually find that I have
to turn it wrong side out.) Then, too, if a fellow's bound to marry a foolâ and a lot of men have
to if they're going to hitch up into a well-matched teamâ there's nothing like picking a good-looking
one. .
I believe in short engagements and long marriages. I don't see any sense in a fellow's sitting
around on the mourner's bench with the sinners, after he's really got religion. The time to size up the
other side's strength is before the engagement. ) Â¦
Some fellows propose to a girl before they know whether her front #nd her back hair match",
and then holler that they're stuck when they find that she's got a cork leg and a glass eye as well. I
haven't any sympathy with them.
They start out on the principle that married people Have only, one meal a day, and that of fried
oysters and tutti-frutti icecream after the theater. Naturally, a girl's got her better nature and her
best complexion along under those circumstances; but the really valuable thing to know is how she
approaches ham and eggs at 7 a. m., and whether she brings her complexion with her to the break
fast table. And these fellows make a girl believe they're going to spend all the time between 8 and ir
p. m., for the rest of their lives, holding a hundred and forty pounds, live weight, in their lap, and
saying that it feels like a feather. The thing to find out is whether, when one of them gets up to
holding a ten-pound baby in his arms for five minutes, he's going to carry on as if it weighed a ton.

the courtiers. The : chief, calling to his
piper, commanded him instantly to com
pose a pibroch for the King, and that
ready musician, . swelling with pride,
marched . up and down and round and
round the great hall pouring forth a tri
umphal quickstep with many wonderful
flourishes and variations. Then at a
word' from the chief each man placed his
flagon on the table, whipped out his
sword, swung it overhead, to the amaze
ment of the courtiers, for It is not in ac
cord with etiquette to show cold steel to
the eyes of the King. Down came the
blades Instantly and together, each man
splitting in two the goblet he had drunk
from. . Â¦ . .
".You must all come to Loch Tay,". cried
the. chief, "and I will show you a ban
queting hall In' honor of James V such
as - you'have never before seen." .Then
to the horror of the courtiers he suddenly
smote the King on the back with his open
palm and cried, "Jamie, my - lad' - you'll
come and visit me at Loch Tay?"
The smitten King laughed heartily and
; â¢;Â¦ "Yes, Finlay, I will."
; The next day the MacNabs set faces
toward the north on their long tramp
home. . ; . â¢
"What proud 'deevils' <they are!" said
Sir David Lyndsay to the King after the
company, had departed. "I have been
through the . MacNab country from : one
end of it to the other, and there is 'not
- a decent hut - on the hillside. let alone '. a
castle/ fit, , to -; entertain - a king, yet T the
chief glves> an invitation in _the. heat, of
wine and", when The. is sobered l he .is too
proud to admit that he cannot make good
the words he has uttered."
On the last night there was a banquet,
which was the best that Stirling could be
etow, in honor of the Clan MacNab. The
great hall was decorated with the colors
Cf the clan, and at the further end had
been painted the arms of the MacNab.
Five pipers of the King's court had
learned the "Salute to the Chief.", and
now, headed by . MacNab'a own. they
paced up and down the. long room, mak
ing It ring with their warlike, music. The
King and the chieftain came in together,
and as the latter 'took, his place at his
host's right hand bis impassive face be-
The captain of the guard brought the
chief his sword and would have presented
it to him, but the King himself arose and
took the weapon in his own hand, tender
ing it to Its owner. The chieftain accepted
the sword and rested its point on the
floor, then in dignified native courtesy
he doffed .his broad, feathered bonnet.
"Sire," he said, with slow deliberation,
"Scotland has a King that this good blade
shall ever be proud to serve."
For three days the MacNabs were the
guests of the King in his castle, while
the legal documents were being prepared.
King and chieftain walked the town to
gether, and all that Stirling had to show
MacNab beheld.
In hand, how would you have treated me,
Finlay the Fifth?"
â¢â¢If you had come with only twenty
men behind you I should treat you with
all the hospitality of Glendochart, which
far exceeds that of Stirling."
"It ha* all been a mistake." said the
King with great cordiality. "The parch
ment you seek shall be gi^n to you, and
I trust that your generosity, Lord of
Glendochart, will allow me to amend your
opinion of Stirling hospitality. I shall
take it kindly if you will be my guests in
the castle. until my officers of law repair
the harshness of my ancestor, Robert.",
Then, turning to the guard, the King con
tinued:
"Unbind these gentlemen and return to
them their arms." ..' , Â¦Â¦";Â¦ 5 . '../'.:. : r .v'C. .

. "tout some of them hav* wounds they will
not forget in a hurry; the Highlandmen

Â¦Â¦; Â¦ ot many are there of them?" asked
the King.
"Scznethlrg mor* than a score, with a

though I must say he knows what to do
with a swerd."
"All anaed, you say?"
Â» "Every oa* of them but the piper.

"Certainly, your Majesty."
"Verr wall; bring them la. and let us

The doors were fiu&g open, a sharp
ccmziand was given, and presently there
entered th* group cf Highlanders, dis
armed and with their elbows tied behind
their backs. A. strong guard accompanied
' them on either side. The Highlanders
Â¦were men of magnificent physique, en
hanced by the picturesque costume they
were, in spit* of the fact that in some
. Instances this costume was In tatters and
the wearers cut and bleeding. The King
Â¦Fazed with undisguised admiration upon
t he foremost Highlander, and eaid quietly
to the captain of the guard:
"Unbind him!"
' On finding his arms released the moun
taineer stretched them out twice, then
folded them across his breast, making no â¢
: motion, however, to remove his plumed
bonnet, although every one else In the
. room except himself and his men was
uncovered.
â¢â¢You have come In from the country."
. began the King, a suspicion of a smile
.bovermg about his lips, "to enjoy the

The big Highlander made no reply, but
Crowned heavily.

"Yes. bring him in."

bowing low to the King, said smoothly:
"Thi* man humbly begs to Inform your

the King. 'Translate faithfully exactly

The red wine of Burgundy, grown old in
the King's cellars, they drank like water,
emptying their tankards as fast as the at
tendant could refill them. Soon the ruddy
fluid, whose- potency had been underesti
mated, began to have its effect, and the
dinner table became noisy as "the meal
progressed, songs bursting forth now and
then, with strange shouts and cries more
familiar to the hills of Loch Tay than to
the rafters of Stirling. The chief him
self lost the solemn dignity which had at
first characterized him, and as he emptied
flagon after flagon, he boasted loudly of
the prowess of his dan; foretold what he
would do in future, fields now that he was
allied with the King of Scotland.
At last MacNab sprang to his feet, hold
ing aloft bis brimming flagon, and called
for cheers for the King of Scotland, a
worthy prince who knew well how to en
tertain a brother prince. Repeating this
in . Gaelic his men. who had also risen
with their chief, now sprang . upon the
benches, where, standing unsteadily, they
raised a series of yells so wild that a
shudder of fear passed through many of
â¢That rery thing is troubling me." re
plied the King, "but it's a long time till
July, and between now and then we will
make him some excuse for not returning
his visit, and thus avoid putting the old
man to shame."
"But that, too, will offend him beyond
repair," objected the poet.
"Well, we must lay our heads together,
Davle," answered the- King, "and think of
some way that will neither be an insult
nor a humiliation." â¢ .' â¢.:!'
Affairs of state gave James the valid
excuse he required and so he sent a com
mission to the chief of the MacXabs.
"His Majesty," said the head commission
er,- "Is entertaining the Embassadors from
Spain and from France, and likewise a
legate from the Pope. If he came north
he must at least bring with him these
great noblemen with their retinues, and
while he would hav* been glad to visit
you with soma of his own men he could'
not Impose upon your hospitality by
bringing also a large number of strangers
and foreigners."
"Tell his Majesty," replied MacNab
with dignity, "that whether he bring with
him the King of Spain, th* Emperor of
Franc* or even the Pope himself, none of
these princes Is. in the estimation of Mao-
Nab, superior to James the Fifth of Scot
land. Th* entertainment, therefore, which
the King graciously condescends to ac
cept, is certainly good enough for any
foreigners that may accompany him, be
their nobility ever so high."
When this reply was reported to th*
King h* first smiled and then sighed.
"I can do nothing further," he said.
"Return to MacNab and tell him that the
Pope's legate desires to visit the Priory
on Loch Tay. Tell the chief that we' will
take the boat along the lake on the day
arranged. Say that the foreigners are
anxious to taste th* venison of the hills,
and that nothing could bo better than to
give us a dinner under the trees. Tell him
that he need not be at any trouble to pro
vide us lodging, for we shall return to
the island Priory and there sleep."
In the early morning the King and his
followers, the Embassadors and their
trains embarked and sailed from the
island Priory the length of the beautiful
lake; the numerous craft being driven
through the water by strong northern
oarsmen, their wild chanting choruses
echoing back from the mountains. The
evening before horses for the party had
been led through forests, over the hills
and along the strand to the meeting place
at the other end of the lake.
A summer has* hung in the valley, and
when the King came In sight of the
stronghold of th* MacNabs he rubbed his
eyes in wonder, thinking the misty uncer
tainty of the atmosphere was playing
tricks with his vision. There, before
them, stood the most bulky edifice, the
most extraordinary pile h* had ever be
held. At one end a great square keep
iarose, its amazing height looming gigan
tically in the gauze-like magic of the
mist. A high wall, machicolated at the
top, connected this keep with a small oc
tagonal tower, whose twin was placed
some distance to the left, leaving an
opening between for a wide entrance. The
two octagonal towers formed a sort of
fram* for a roaring waterfall in the back
ground. From the second octagonal tow
er another extended lofty wall connected
it with a round peel as high as the keep.
This castle, of a size so enormous that it
made all others its beholders had ever
seen shrink Into comparative insignifi
cance, was surrounded by a bailey wall;
outside of that was. a moat which proved
to be a foaming river fed by the volume
of water which came down the precipice
behind th*- castle.
"We have a great many strongholds in
Italy," said the Pope's legate, "but never
have- I seen anything to compare with
this."
"Oh." said MacNab. slightingly, "we are
but a small clan; you should see the High
land castle* farther north; they are of
stone; Indeed, our own fortresses, which
are further inland, are also of stone. This
is merely our pleasure house, built of pine
trees."
"A castle of logs!" exclaimed the Pope's
legate. "I never before heard of such a
thing." #>
They crossed the bridge, passed between
the two octagonal towers and entered the
extensive courtyard, â¢ surrounded by th*
castle Itself; a courtyard broad enough to
afford maneuvering ground for an army.
The interior walls were as attractive as
the outside was grim and forbidding. Bal
conies, ran around three sides of the in
closure, tall, thin, straight pine poles, ris
ing three stories high, supporting them,
each pole fluttering a flag at th* top. Tha
balconies were all festooned with branches
of living green.
Inside, the King .and his men found
"Chieftain," said the legat* In an awad
whisper, "is this conflagration aocldeot or
design?" '- :Â¦
"It is' our custom." replied MaoNab.
"A monarch's pathway must be . lighted,
and it is not fitting that a residence once
honored by our King should sver again
be occupied by any one leas noble. The
pine tree is the badge of my clan. At my
behest the pine tree sheltered th* Kins;.
and now, at the blast of my bugle, it
sends forth to the glen Its farewell of
flame." '
At the next blast thosa on the bailey
wall thrust their torches, still burning,
among thÂ» chinks of the log* and
swarmed to the ground as speedily and
as safely as those on the main building.
Now the lighted torches that had been
thrown on the roof of the castle, disap
pearing a moment from sight, gar* evi
dence of their existence. Her*' and there
a long tongue of flams sprang up and
died down again.
"Can nothing be done to sav* the pal
ace?" shouted the excitable Frenchman.
"The waterfall! the waterfall! Let us go
back or the castle will be destroyed."
"Stand where you are," said the chief,
"and you will see a sight worth coming
north for."
Now, almost with' the suddenness of an
explosion, great sheets of flam* ros*. tow
ering into a mountain of fir*. TbÂ« logs
themselves seemed to redden m the; light
glowed through every crevice between
them. The bastions, the bailey- walls,
were great wheels of flame, encircling a
palace that had all the vivid radiance of
molten gold. The valley for miles up and
down was lighter than the sun ever made
it. : â¢'
And with that, bowing to the Kinf as if
to ask permission, he raised his bug!* to
his lips and blew a blast. Instantly frora
the corner of the farthest bastion a torch
flamed forth, and that torch lighted tha
one next* to it. and this Us neighbor, so
that speedily a rim of flre ran along the
outlines of the castle, marking out the
square towers and the round, lining thÂ«
curtain, the smaller towers, turrets and
parapets. Then at the top of the bailey
wall a circle of Highlanders lit torch after
torch, and thus was the whola castle il
lumined by a circle of flre. The huge edi
fice was etched In flame against the som
ber background of the high mountain.
"Confess, legate." cried the King, "that
you never saw anythnlg more beautiful,
even in fair Italy."
"I am willing to admit aa much." re
plied the Roman.
Another blast from the bugle and all
the torches on the castle itself disap
peared, though the flre on the ballsy wall
remained intact. From . machloolated
tower, keep, peel and curtain, tha nimble
Highlanders, terchless. scrambled down,
cheering as they came. :
For a moment the castle wall* were
alive with fluttering tartans, strongly Il
luminated by the torches from the outer
bailey. Each man held +Â£s breath while
this perilous acrobatic performance was
being accomplished, and silence reigned
over the royal party until suddenly
broken by tha Italian.
"Highlander." he cried, "your castle I*
on flre."
"Ay," said the Highlander calmly,
raising his bugle again to his lips.
"A bulwark of bones U better than a
castle of stones," Â«aid Sir Flnlay. "That
Is an old Highland saying with us, which
means that a brave following 1* the best
ward. I will show you my bulwark of
bones."
Bo they all- stayed progress! â¢Â»* turned
their eyes toward the wooden palace they
had left. Â¦ A .
"If It were built of stone," said the>
Pope's legate, "it would bÂ« the strongest
house in the world a* It is thÂ» largest."
It was evening of the third day when
the cavalcade set out araln for the priory.
Â¦The chief. Flnlay MacNab. accompanied
his guests down the- valley, and when
some distance from the castle, of logs
James smote him. on the shoulder, copy
ing thus his own astonishing: action.
"Sir Flnlay." he cried, "a King's hand
should be no less potent than a King's
sword, and thus I. create thee a knight of
my realm, for never before has monarch
been so royally entertained." and now I
pause here to look once more on your cas
tle of pine."
emp:Â« accommodations: their room* wwi
carpeted with moss and with flowai,
forming a variety of color and yielding *
softness to the foot. which the- artificial
piles of Eastern looms would have at
tempted to rival In vain~ HerÂ© for three
days the royal party was entertained.
Hunting in the forest rave them prodig
ious appetites, and there was no criticism
of the cooking. The supply of food and
drink was lavish in the extreme; fish
from the river and locn, game from the
moors and venison from the hills.

THE household rubbish and the
streetsweepings of New ..York are
carted to the thirteen river dumps.
The j most \ important of these are
the ones at One Hundred and Tenth

the foot of. Carial street. * The former re
ceives the waste â¢ of the . Immense apart

For bubble-blowing without pipes lm
meiws the hands in a bowl, of water and
rub one band lightly, with a bit o"f soap;
avoid lathering as far as possible. 7i Now
close the hand and then open it so that
the tip of the thumb and first finger join
to form a ring, across which a soap film
is stretched. Then blow upon the liquid
film. It dilates at once, and if the stream
of air is kept' up the bubble may crow
to quite huge proportions. As soon as the
blowing etops. the hand must be closed or'
the stretched elastic film will shrink to
its original blze. After closing the hand,
the, bubble Is detached by elevating the
wrist, and allowing It to slide off the fin
ger^ tips.
The most successful -babbles 'are f made
of soft water, rain or 'spring water, to
which a little glycerine Is added; this
gives tenacity and brilliancy. -A better
solution still Is to dissolve castllo soap
In about ferty times Jts weight in water
and adding about bne-hrth ItÂ« bulk of gly
cerine; after three days *Â«"a"t the solu-
large film and then disengage the funnel,
after, having first turned It at right aJi
gles. This trick always mystifies and de
ligntE, and helps to make the soap-bubble
party something out of thÂ« ordinary.
Another trick is to blow a bubble upon
n. flower-a stiff . petaled flower Is best,
particularly one of .brilliant hue. Dip the
flower into the soIuUon of soap and water
and then, with a pipe, blow the bubble
upon the top of itJ â¢
Only last summer," â¢ under the all-search

Suppose you'are sitting about a table
with a dozen friends, and some subject la
started in .which you are deeply Inter
ested. Toy engage in'an earnest and se
rious dialogue'with one of them at the
other end of the table. Too are perfectly
at ease. You forget yourself, you do not
care in the least for your manner or tone
of voice, but only for your thought. The
tone you adopt then will ordinarily be the
best tone for you rn public speaking. You
can, however,: learn from teachers or
friendly critics to avoid any harsh or dis
agreeable fashion of speech that you may
have fallen into and that may be habitual
to.you in private conversation.
Next, never strain your vocal organs by
attempting to till spaces which are too
large .for; you. Speak as loudly and dis
tinctly as you can do easily, and let more
distant portions of your audience go. You
will find in that way. very soon, that your
voice will Increase in compass and power,
and you will do better than by a habit
of straining the .voice beyond it natural
capacity. Be .careful to avoid falsetto,
either in tone or style. Shun imitating
the tricks of speech of other orators, evea
of-those famous and successful. The**
may do for them, but not for you.
Never makV a gesture for the sake of
making one. I believe that most of the
successful speakers whom I know would
find It hard to tell you whether they
themselves make gestures or not, they
are so absolutely unconscious in the mat
ter. But with gestures as with voice, get
teachers or friendly critics to point. out
to you any bad habit you may fall into.
I thinlc it would be. well if our youaj
public speakers, especially preacher**
would have competent. Instructors and
'critics among their auditors, after tSey
enter their profession; to give them the
benefit;; of such and counsel
as may be suggested In that way.

A Holland Season.
' One might declare it to be a Holland
reason, for eo many things are set forth
In a style Hollandaise. and a pretty style
Is the Dutch.
There is. for one thing, the roun-i
Dutch neck, the neck which is simply cut

many of the afternoon gowns end is worn
much for evening by those who do not
like the decollete gown. It is the fad.
too, for the summer dress and, if you
would be right in the ewini you must
have a Dutch neck, rounded and finishei
with a littl* knife plaiting of ribbon no
Â¦wider than a straw.
Another l>utch feature is the wea-'.rs

that seen In China blue. It makes up
beautifully in the linens and can be com
bined with a touch of black or with a
touch cf white, or, if one wishes to be
very smart, with a touch of red.
While Londoners go to Holland for their
pretty things, Wllhelmina goes to Paris
tor hers. The little Dutch Queen is par
ticularly fond of French gowns, and, with
her Prince, with whom she seems to be
enjoying a second honeymoon, she selects
dresses that throw the Paris modistes
Into ecstades of delight, so elaborate and
Intricate are they.
One of Wilhelmina's new gowns is a

blue and white, a beautiful chain going

they are out in great numbers. The old
tones seem to have been forgottfn in the
maze of the new or.es and the standards
are lost behind the glory of tne novelties.
Pearl gray, wood color and corn color,
three of the good o!d favorites, remain,
but one sees them combined - witb

fÂ«.rever. but which Is still such a novelty
that Its life has scarcely been fully test
ed. But being < light and pretty, it haÂ»
caught on in fancy's eye.
All the World Wears Pink.
Pink seems to be taking the piacj of
gray to a considerable . extent and very
pretty it is. Matrons who have worn Ihe
Quaker tone have slipped into pink with
out realizing it, while the debutantes
have gloried in it. Pink canvas makes a
very nice dress for nlorning or afternoon
and pink linen is a fabric that is much,
seen.
The utility of pink as a general color
has been questioned, many declaring that
It is neither durpbie nor becoming. But
is it not as durable as gray? Will a pearl
gray canvas afternoon dre-s wear longer
tl-en one of pink? And if for summer
wear, will jiirik not be as pretty as gray?
That Is a series of questions which the
modistes are putting to their patrons.
A pretty innovation much noticed in
London is found in the method of usins
the flounce. The skirt flounce has chang
ed to a degree, and while most skirts aro
flounced, they are treated quite differ
ent ly- t from before.
Thu deep lace flounce Is given a touch of
great elegance by putting it. on in littU*
dips. The flounce should dip here aivl
there at regular intervals, 'each dip mak
ing a point.
To accomplish this take your lace,
which should be deep and pretty, though
it need not be a precious lace, and cut it
1p sc-alloDS around the top. Go the full
length of the flounce, cutting the top out
in great scalloped sweeps. Now take and
sew the flounce upon the skirt. When
done the bottom of the flounce will dip in
points. For this a close mesh is better
than a very open one, as the top keeps
its shape better.
A flounce that trims a summer gown is
pointed in the same manner. But in this
case it is made of lawn with a narrow
lace edge. The top of the flounce is cut
in curves, and the flounce is then sawed
on the skirt. When the skirt is put on
the flounce Is a pointed one, and the little
"dips" set out in a very pretty fashion. .
One Nice Silk Pe'tticoat.
The summer woman should endeavor to
Invest in one nice silk petticoat. Indeed,
this seems almost a necessity. In the way
of a nice petticoat is meant one that is
all little frills and ruffles and which has
a veritable cascade of flounces around the
feet. A billowy skirt of th'.s kind sets
the drts? out well and makes it hang
much better than the # plain little drop
ekirt with its stiff foot 'ruffle. But. alas,
such a petticoat is expensive, and the wo
man who desires one may have to go to
work and build it for htrself.
When one does possess a skirt with
the billowy effect around the foot, she
must be sure to lift the dress skirt suffi
ciently to let the billows Bet forth in
silhouette. The petticoat itself is not lifted
but cascades and billows as it will. The
fashionable petticoat silhouette is a fea
ture of dress not to be neglected by any
woman with an eye to her good looks.
It is a surprising thing to note, yet a
true one, that stockings are growing more
and more vivid, and this upon women who
have been wedded to black since black
cess of Pless, wh,o does everything In *
way that is ultra, wears a dress of pluck
and white etrlped summer silk. The skirt
Is made very tight-fitting right down to
the knees, and the stripes run up and
down. This upper part of the skirt -is
tucked also, and the tucks are so ar
ranged that only the dark stripes ore
visible with occasional flashes of thÂ»
white. . ' 'Â¦" Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢/;. '-'.:
Then comes the great foot flounce which
in this case is a veritable flounce, 'kne*

the. back. ' It Is made of th* striped blsck

top with bands of black silk ribbon, and

you that the foreign stylet AT* not aa

Th* American modistes have a way of
making a gown that is pronounced by th*
drees artists "faithful." .* They follow on*
motif throughout; and where there ar*
pintucked skirts there is a pin tucking oa
the waist; and. where th* skirt yoke Is a

rood thing. General Hughes Issued from
army headquarters an official order to
that effect. The commanding officer of ;

training of the men and the games. The
department appointed . an athletic' board
to supervise this new feature of soldier
life. One day In every month was ordered
set Aside for a field day. on which the
enlisted men Â¦ should compete for prizes.
On field days all drills were ordered
omitted,' so that all might enjoy the oc

the men look forward from one month to

THE WRAPPED WEFT type of wear-

Mission Indians of California. The Pimas
now have a carrying basket in which the
net Is used.
TOOLS AND TERMS UBED.-The bas
ketmaker should be provided with the
following tools. A needle (about a No. 9
tapestry, needle to begin with), strong
scissors, an awl about four inches long, a
small hammer, a yard measure and a
foot rule; a sharp knife, a small plat
pliers or pincers; a narrow piece of heavy
iron or steel that can be used as a ham

Rattan is one of tbe most popular of
basket-making materials, because It is
light, long, tough, flexible and fissile. The
rt'eent awakening to the importance of
basketry has brought rattan into marked
prominence. Prepared for. commerce rat
tan is stripped of its leaves and bark and
is put up in bundles or round " or - fiat
strips, numbered from 1 to 15. No. 1 be

Buckeye splints are good and several
kinds axe well adapted to this purpose.

Raffia is the name given to a Madagas
car palm. It has a long leaf, over fifty
feet in length, and thus the tree Is often
from elxty to seventy feet high to the
tips of the leaves. The leaf Itself Is very
brittle end would be useless for this
work, but the f.bers stripped from its
outside, it rough and pliable.
Professor James has written a book
entitled "How to Make Indian and Other
Baskets." which is the most complete and
authoritative treatise ever published. It is
from this excellent source that the fol
lowing Is reprinted:
The batket to the uncontaminated In
dian meant a work of art. in m-nlcn hope,
aspiration, desire, loi-e. religion, poetry,
national 'pride, mythology, were all more
or less interwoven. Hence the work was
approached in a tplrit as far removed
from that of mere commercialism, pass
ing whim or fancy, as It was from that
of levity, caretebsness or Indifference.
RafSa is ideal wea\*ing material for un
trained fingr is. It is soft and flexible and
easily handled. As strength and digital
dexterity increase stronger materials can
be used. ep;>ecially as they afford bo much

Plunged Into en all sides by the girl who
regards It es a fad. by the girl who
wishes to add to her collection and by
the girl who would do anything to keep
ber firgerr busy and kill time.
There used to be a time when the bas
ket that you cou'.d purchase from an old
trader was considered finer than one
picked up In a chop, and one made by
a "white" was not to be thought of for
a moment. Perhaps the people most to
blame In this transformation are the
tourists that yearly flood the southern
part of the State. A thrifty eoul. capable
to the ends of her fingers tipÂ« and with
an eye to business, learned the art of
making and coloring and then she
promptly hied herself to th* various
hotels and kept herseif busy teaching the
folks of the Kastern States what the
Cailforniar.s didn't know themsetve*.
Never trust one woman to keep to her
self anythirjr especially interesting. While
her intentions may be absolutely g-Â»od
the temptation to impart news is too
ctrorg to be resisted, and besides it Is
much more sociable to chat anJ work at
the eatne time. So It was oniy a matter
of a very few months until everybody of
the south was making baskets, and what
Is more to the point, making them so
well that they defied detection.
BROWN AND PURPLE.â Logwood ex

with ammonia a , good purple. Walnut

dissolve the ctick, and alcohol must be
ufced for . â¢Â« purpose. The powder is
much easier to handle.
RED.â Cochineal, though animal. Is sug
gested for a aark, deep red. Combined
with cream of tartar it gives a bright red.
Madder gives a dull red and 'can be bought
from the druggists in powder form.'Cran
berries give a dull red. and beets a color
similar but more satisfactory. The poke
berry gives a purple red. You will not
care to handle the poke berries, as they
stain t..e hands badly.
When the slum is well dissolved place
the liquid in a small tub and soak the ma
terial to be dved for fully two hours.
This allows the fiber of the raffla or rat
tan to take up the mordant, and thus
prepare for the permanent fixing of the

GREEN.â Indigo, to be purchased from

tt roust be confessed It Is difficult to han
dle without experience. Learners will find
that indigo will not dissolve in water. Sul
phuric acid will dissolve it, but the add
will rot the material to be used. Bo be

must be neutralized by an addition of soda.
The sulphuric add is poured on the in

causing the liquid to foam in an alarm
ing manner. There is nothing to fear.
however. As soon as the indigo is fully
dissolved, add water and put in the soda
until It stops, foaming. Be sure to keep
your bands out of this mixture. Use a
slick to rtlr It with. It is well to make
plenty of this mixture, which keep stir

pletely neutralize the sulphuric add. and
the dye can be used with safety, diluting
with water when used.
As a rule all materials and dyes n*ed
a mordant. This Is to "fix" the dye.
Aluir Is a good ordinary mordant and can
be had. cheaply, anywhere. As a general
principle, however, chemistry teaches that
where you have an acid dye it is well to
have an alkali mordant, end when an al
kali dye an scid mordant. Some suggest
the use of a solution of alum dissolved in
a auart. of water. Others prefer much
less, preferably about four ounces to two
gallons of water.
To learn to dye well is a liberal education
in many things. One basket-maker found
in the purple iris a dye almost as deep as
Us own blossom. The faded flowers are
full of the purple liquid, and, when they
are rubbed on rattan, color it a beautiful
fhade' which is quite as fast as most
dyes.
cutting implements are uied. The broad
ttrlp Is placed Inside the groove of the
"elicer." which has three or more tiny
but sharp knives protruding from its
base. As the splint is drawn through the
cutter It is cut into the desired width, the
knives being set by gauge or screw.
Where no cutter is to be had the strips
may be made with scissors, but this is a
slo^y and laborious task.
In the matter of dyeing set firmly and
forever in your minds that aniline dyes
are "anathema" to all all true basketry
lovers. They are the "accursed things"
which bring sorrow into the camp of the
unfaithful. Do not touch them. Dtscour
agÂ» their use In others.
Vegetable dyes are softer in tone, more
harmonious, more permanent and better
in accord with basketry work. The loud
trumpet tones of aniline colors do not suit
euch soft and flexible work as basketry.
L Three-ply twined weaving and braid
ing In several styles:
1. PLAIN TWINED WEAVING.â The
primitive mode of wea-vin* requires a. set
â¢f warp elements arranged parallel to
each other. Two splints or weaves com
pose the woof and they are twisted with
tv half-turn around each warp stem. The
Aleut and Halda baskets are made In
this weave.
*. DIAGONAL TWINED WEAVING.â
The only difference between this style and
the plain Is In the manner the woof
weavers cross the warp strands. The
technlc consists In passing over two or
more warp elements at each half turn;
there must be an odd number of warps,
for in the rest round the same pair of
warps are not Included In the half turns.
The ridges, therefore, on the outsids. are
cot vertical as In plain twined weaving,
fcut pass diagonally over the surface.
t. WRAPPED TWINED WEAVING.â
In this weave element the twine Is
passed bbrixontally along the uprlgut
warp stem, generally on the Inside, while
the other Is wrapped around It and the
trprlght warp. The variations of one row
â¢X stitches Inclining to the right and the
other to the left Is caused by the weaver's
wxappÂ«g from above or below. Wben.the
rows of these stitches are forced closely
Â«pon one another the effect is the exact
method followed by the Neah Bay weav
ers. '
4. LATTICE TWINED WEAVING.â It Is
believed that this form of weaving Is con-
6. THREB-PLT TWINED WEAVING.â
The three-ply twined weaving Is the use
of three weft splints and other kinds of
weft elements Instead of two. and there
are four ways of administering the- weft,
vlr.: (a) three-ply twine, (b) three-ply
braid, (c) three-ply false, embroidery.

â¢ ' The first sign of loss of form In woman
is the depression between the point of the

'following exercise is suggested. The arms
are held rigid, the toes turned out and
, legs rigid. The shoulders are lifted up
toward the ears with great pressure.
Take a long breath as the shoulders- are

arms are pressed against ths stomach.
The next beauty exercise Is as folio tee:
Place the hands on the hips, lifting ths
chest clean up from the hips, inhaling
and throwing the elbows as far back as
ybu can. In expelling the breath, bend

For an even, development of ths arm
without muscular knots, hold the arms

The same movement may be executed
with the legs. Stand perfectly upright

patients without danger of injury to themselves.
They all wear bloomer costumes while exercising. The room **t
aside for them is a large, airy apartment. There is little or no appa
ratus for them to use, and it was this lack that led Mr. Harrison, tÂ©
formulate the following course of exercises tr meet the demand.
Mr. Harrison is president of the Olympic Club, one of the great
est athletic institutions in the world. He has made a life-long study
of the upbuilding of both sexes. He is a shining example of what
proper training will do for a man. Although over 6O years of age, hÂ»
is as nimble and dear skinned as any man of 30. He is capable of out
walking any athlete in the dub.
Therefore the following artide from his' pen, specially illustrated
by the nurses at the City and Counts' Hospital. U of rare scientific value,

TRAINING NURSES FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY
HOSPITALTHE TIGER'S BRIDALâ CAN YOU FIND THE TWELVE WEDDING GUESTS?
ONCE upon a time there was about to occur in the jungle an event of unuÂ»ual importance, and never, within the memory of the oldest inhabitant had there been any such doings before,. for
this affair was to eclipse all previous efforts of the kind. - It had been the one topic of conversation for weeks, and all the anxious mothers and longing daughters looked with envy. on the
Tigress, for she was to be married. The only creature who showed evident displeasure at the approaching nuptials was the father of the bride-elect, and he waj unreconcilable.. She hav
ing been the idol of her father's heart since she was knee high to the measles, it was only natural that he should feel grave concern -'for her future welfare. Her fiance, the Leopard, had
proven himself distasteful to his intended father-in-law on many occasions, and, in the language of the up-to-date youth. of that period, he was "on to him." The Tigress had been reared in the
lap of refinement and luxury, and her intellect and gentleness of disposition had won for her many admireTs in. her own circle, so that she might easily have chosen, for her companion ' in life one
more worthy of her than the Leopard, for he was very much her inferior in every way. -Her father had repeatedry tried to convince her of the folly of an alliance with one so far beneath her, but
because she was in love she failed to see it that way, for "love is blind." While the mother was a good and 1 worthy creatitre in most ways, she seemed to lack the foresight possessed by the
father, and, although the difference in station and natures of the young couple may have caused her some slight apprehension, still she lost no sleep over it, and went on with the preparations for
the wedding with unabated , delight. At last the wedding day arrived. The affair passed off nicely,. and was conceded to be the most gorgeous and brilliant event since the funeral of Cock Robin,
and amid the usual deluge of rice, old shoes and good wishes the happy pair went forth into -the' world to enjoy their honeymoon, and, presumably, many, many years of wedded bliss. After
all the excitement incidental to such affairs had passed away the young couple settled down in life and waited for the stork to pay them a visit Of course, at with, most married people, there
arose little differences between them, and had the Leopard been of the same gentle and refined turn of mind as his bride, they mightihave passed off as only little misunderstandings, but, alas! his
true nature now began to assert itself, and things went from bad to worse. Instead of being able to exalt hit nature to the level ofner own. as ihe had planned, she found herself sinking to his
place, and she began to realize to her sorrow that the only way to get along with her spouse was to be a brute like he was. To .one of her gentleness and refinement such a thing was ao re
pugnant that she went back home and got a divorce... . , . .;
The moral of this fable is that "A Leopard Cannot Change His Spots." Â¦ ' \ W. M. GOODE2L \

I r Â¦ l Atr > H^ cn -~ Â°' Manila was put into
j W^ direct telegraphic communlca-
B tion with San Francisco shortly
after 8 o'clock laEt night, when
President Roosevelt's message
was flashed across the great Pacific cable.
Then It was that the fondest hope of the
late John W". Mackay was realized, for
the first wave sent across the longest
stretch of cable in ell the world signal
ized the fact that the wonderful Pacific
cable was at last a reality. v ';.:-. j
. The opening of the cable. to Manila. was I
a success in every way. The weather
conditions were ideal and there was noth
ing to mar the occasion so long looked for
by the people of this city and the Philip
pines. After the first message was trans
mitted the cable was found to be.work
ing perfectly, and, beginning to-day,
regular messages can be transmitted over
the long stretch of wire as fast as the
operators can handle them.
No excitement marked the opening of
the great wire that is acknowledged to
be the grandest triumph in mechanical
! skill since the completion of the trans
! continental railway. Only a few tit the
jLoperators and one official of the Postal
Telegraph Company were present when
the wire began to tick off the first .words
of greeting between the two cities, sepa
rated from each other by 8300 miles of
water.
Superintendent Storrorof the Postal Tele
graph Company and the cable operators
were the only persons present at the time.
They waited arid 'watched eagerly for the
first throb of the little needle against the
tape. When the first sign was visible
each nodded to the other and then
breathed a sigh of relief, for this was the
signal that the cable worked well and
that . the vast undertaking was a suc
cess.
Piles upon piles of telegrams of con
gratulation were received during the day
at the office of the Postal Company, to be
transmitted to various persons in Manila
from persons of more or less importance
in this nation and city. It. was Impos
sible, however, to send them last night
and only the more important of the tele
grams were ticked over the wire. *(
A message from Mayor Schmitz was
sent and another from the Chamber of
Commerce of this city to the American
Chamber of Commerce of Manila. These
were the only local messages sent last
night, for the reason that the officials
of the cable company did not wish to
crowd the cable with an abundance of
matter that was of no" great importance.
Mayor Schmltz's message was as fol
lows:
SAX FRANCISCO - July 4 1903.
Goxernor Taft, Manila. .Philippine Islands-.
Accept San Francisco's heartiest greetings and
conjpra-tulntlon*. - May this'; new achievement
of *nterprise and science .finally completed

Our Cure has been earnestly endorsed by distinguished Judges of San Francisco and L*>*

Our long- experience in the treatment of victims of Alcoholism enables us effectually to de-

Pope becam? suddenly worse after yes
terday's drive In the Vatican gardens,
when, notwithstanding the temperature
was 93 degrees Fahrenheit he caught cold,
which settled in his chest and head, pro
ducing shortly afterward bronchial ca
tarrh, accompanied by a slight cough,
thirst, lassitude and watery eyee.
Feeling his responsibility. Dr. Lap
ponl would have liked to have a con
sultation with the best physicians in
Rome, but the Pope absolutely refused
to acquiesce to this. Ho said he had
every confidence in Dr. Lapponl and add
ed that the- only other person he would
allow to te called was Dr. Mazzoni, who
operated on the Pontiff In 1899. When
Dr. Lapponl remarked that Dr. Mazzoni
was a surgeon and that therefore his pro
fessional services were not needed the
Pope replied:
"It does not matter; it is not for his
profession that I want him, but because
I like him."
It. has therefore been decided that Dr.
Mazzoni shall visit the Pope to-morrow
mornins.
TWO CARDINALS KNOW TRUTH!
An 'official statement of the true condl:
tlon of the Pope has been made only to
Cardinal Rampolla, aa Papal Secretary of
State, and Cardinal Oreglia dl Santo Ste
fano, a3 dean of the sacred college and
Camerlongo. In the latter capacity Car
dinal Oreglia, in the event of the Pope's
death, will perform an important cere
mony. Assuming violet robes of mourn
ing, 'he >' will proceed, to the death room,
where,'; while all'are kneeling, he will un
vcll: the. face of the departed and strike
the forehead of the dead Pontiff with a
silver hammer,; calling the. deceased by
name/ and* then- will solemnly announce
that the" Pope Is^ really dead.
"It-Is alleged that Cardinal Oreglla went
to tho Vatican, .hammer in. hand,- when
Popo Leo was operated on for the removal
of . aS cyst in 1899, and that his . Holiness
had disliked the. Cardinal since that time,
showing this- dislike even last Ma"rch,
when, in answering an address . of con
gratulation -upon . the ninety-third, .anni
versary of his birth, which was read by
Cardinal Â¦ Oreglia as deaiv the Pope; con
trary to ; custom, combated- the opinions
expressed by the .Cardinal on several
questions.. .. , ', il
.. The other Cardinals received private In
formation'of the Pope's illness and some
of them .went to the Vatican, but. they
were .not" allowed to! enter: the sickroom,'
Dr. * La pponl .having given- the strictest
orders that all conversation and cause for
excitement should be avoided.
POPE'S NEPHEW INFORMED.
Practically Pope Leo is nursed only by

o'clock, making the time of its transmis

Mackay replied as follows, his message
going around the world eastward:
"To the President, Ov*ter Bay: I thank
you deeply for your mÂ«Ssage. and I earn
estly hope that the Pacific cable, by open-
Ing the wide horizon of the great East,
may prove a useful factor to the com

"CLARENCE H. MACKAY."
President Roosevelt received the mas
sage at 12:04Â«4 o'clock. The time con
sumed in passing around the world was
nine and a half minute*.
ROUTE OF THE CABLEGRAM.
The course of President Roosevelt's
message around the world was by the
Postal Telegraph Company's land line
from Oyster Bay to San Francisco, thence
by the Commercial Pacific Cable to Hon
olulu, to Midway, to Guam and to Manila.
From Manila to Hongkong the message
passed by the cable which was lifted and
cut by Admiral Dewey in 1898., From
Hongkong it went to Saigon, to Singapore,
to Penang, to Madras, to Bombay, to
Aden, to Sues, to Alexandria, to Malta,
to Gibraltar, to Lisbon and to the Azores.
Between Hongkong and the Azores It
passed by foreign cables. At the Azores
the message was taken up again by the
Commercial Cable Company and sent to
Canac. to New York and to Oyster Bay.
A message starting around the world at
5 a. m. to-day would arrive at Hololulu at
11 p. m. yesterday, at Midway at 10 p. m.
yesterday, at Guam at 1 p. m. to-day and
at Manila at 6 p. m. to-day. It would
pass through India at 3 p. m. to-day and
would return to New York before 6 a. in.
Thus It would have made an excursion
from to-day into yesterday and have ar
rived back at New York within an hour
of the time it started.
Another message leaving New York at
a p. m. to-day would arrive at Guam at
7 a. m. to-morrow, apparently fourteen
hours after it started. Continuing Its

and member of the Veterans' Home
here, shot and killed himself yesterday.
He was 30 years of age and had served
in the Philippines in the Twelfth United
States Infantry. He suffered from a
severe ailment, which was greatly ag
gravated by fits of melancholia. Im
pressed with the idea that there was
no cure for him and feeling that he
might linger and suffer for many years,
the unfortunate man determined to take
his life.
Knowing that a rule of the home
prohibited the members from having
firearms in their possession, he secret
ly wrote to San Francisco and had a
p'istol sent. him by express. No suspi
cion was aroused at his receiving the
package, and he was free to commit the
rash' act.* All hie plans were made and

n^HE man who exercises taste in the selection of
X his clothes need not spend a great deal in grati-
fying his desires, if he uses good business judg-
ment and makes every dollar count.
The clothes we make combine taste and economy.
They are designed, cut and made by skilled crafts-
men and the assortment of sizes in which they are
made insures a perfect fit for any customer. The
patterns are seasonable and arc suited to San Fran-
cisco's climate and necessities.
The ciothes are economical because we make
them in our own workshops and sell direct to the
wearer. This eliminates the middleman's profit and
gives you the clothes at but one fair profit over the
cost of making. In round figures you save fully
twenty-five per cent.
To make the clothes more economical we repair,'
sponge and press them free of charge any time they
are brought in. This alone will save you I5 or $10.
Our stock of ready-to-wear clothes comprises every
sort of garment. The prices range from $8.50 up.
We offer the same advantages in the boy's and
youths' clothing as in the men's.

He bent ovÂ«r Mamie and resumed his
chit. It was all nonsenseâ something
about the silver knob of his cane-^-but it
took hold of the child's fancy and com
forted her. At the next station the .pas
senger across the way had to alight, for
it wa.i the end of her Journey. But look
ing closely as she stood up to leave her
seat she paw Mamie bending forward over
the cane, following the fantastic pattern
of its silver work with one small flusar.
Her face was turned from the bid gen
tleman'a. And behind hfcr little black hat
his tyes were glistening.â New York
.When the passenger across the way
looked again a change had ? come over the
old gentleman's fa"ce. He had taken the
child or. hia knee and was .talking to her,
as. perhaps, he had never talked before.
"Are you hermother?" he asked, look
ing up suddenly and addressing the
woman who had. been holding her.
"Her mother's been dead over a year.
I'm h*r aunt, an* -I'm takin' her home
to rear alone with my own four.- child-
The old gentleman moved uneasily and j
looked harshly at her without. answering, j
"Shame, shame. Mamie!" the woman .
whispered a second time. But the pas- 1
ser.ger across the way saw- her lean back, ;
whhe a tear started and rolled down her
rough cheek.
"Please, sir." repeated Mamie, "won t
ye beat Mr. -Brown wi' this?" , ,
He started around and in -his eyes, be
hind his gold-rlmmed glasses, you could
read the question: "What, in the devil's j
name, does she mean?" The rough- j
cheeked woman rtad it and answered j
huskily:
"Poor little one! She buried her father
this mornln'; an' Mister Brown's the un- |
dertaker." . - . . i
It was a slow local train, and when
they got in the car were pretty well
crowded. They were poor. kln 5 fol Â£;
all dressed in black, and they brought
with them an overpowering smell of crape
and camphor. One of the women in the
party dropped into a seat next to an
aristocratic old gentleman and lifted a
child into her lap. The child was & gray
eyed, pale-haired little* thing of o years.
Her dusty shoes rubbed against the old
gentleman's trousers. He shifted his po
sition, grunted, stuck hia walking stick
upright between his knees and glared at
its fantastic silver knob.
Just here the attention of a fellow pas
senger who sat directly opposite was di
rected by a curious little piece of panto
mine. The child, whose pallor was em
phasized by the crape which smothered
her. was looking closely at the old gentle
man leaning forward on his heavy cane.
He seemed quite unconscious of her
scrutiny' and was tapping one foot im
patiently on the floor.
After a moment the child bent forward
and touched him gently on the knee, lie
took no notice beyond moving closer to
the window and uttering a slight growl.
The woman put out an arm and drew
back the child's hand reprovingly.
The child paid no attention to this. In
another minute she leaned forward agatn
and tapped lhe old gwulemanjs kpee
This time she fetched a louder growl from
him"and a flinty stare, the least
abashed, she took hold of his silver
knobbed cane and shook it to and- fro in
her tiny hand.
"Madam. 1 wish, to heaven you d keep
your brat to yourself!" he growled.
"Shame, shame. Marnier 1 admonished
the poor woman, cowed by. the old man's
looks. The child did not seem to hear.
Instead she pushed the cane toward its
owner, say ins in a shrill little voice:
"Please, sir. won't ye beat Mr. Brown
wi* this?"

SANTA ROSA. July 4.-An attempt is
evidently being made by incendiaries to
destroy a section of this city. â¢ Twice
within less than two weeks the flre de
partment has been called late at night to
cope with a blaze, the origin of Â¦which
has not been explafned. Saturday even
ing a week azo an alarm sounded and
when the firemen arrived they found that
a quantity of bedding had been saturated
with coal oil and lighted in one of the
rooms of a two-story frame structure
on li etieet. The promptness of the de
partment prevented a conflagration at
that time.
The buildings in the vicinity are cloie
together and had the blaze progressed it
would have been difficult to subdue it.
Friday night shortly before the midnight
hour another alarm summoned the fire
men to the eame vicinity to extinguish a
blaze in a house on First street, near D.
The fire bad been started by an incen
diary and was burning fiercely when the
department arrived. After a stubborn
light the flames were stayed, but not mitil
considerable damage had been done.
. In addition . to these fixes' there have
been several other Incendiary blazes in
this city recently, three attempts having
been made to destroy the blacksmith shop
of Robert Ross by flre.

THE second week of the July Clearance Sale will be most remarkable in the Suit and Cloak departmentâfor to-mor-
row morning will witness an array of bargains that has never been equaled, from a value-giving standpoint, in this
city. The reductions that have been made are most comprehensive, including as they do, suits, coats, skirts and
waists of: almost every desirable style and material. In some of the lines the numbers and sizes are limited, so the early
comers will have an advantage. You will find these values to be the best you have' ever been asked to consider, for every
garment is marked to close out â we will not c*arry over a single one into another season. l " .

Referring to the . American eagle, he
said the British lion had tried him twice
and had found him indigestible. Mr.
Choate struck a serious note In the course
of his speech by declaring that all. the
talJc of Anglo-American unity ought to
be more than talk, and he advocated thei.
erection of a statue of Washington in
London - in "the mutual admiration of
both countries." gÂ»

NEW lORK, July 4.â The usual- Fourth
of July celebration was held in. Tammany
Hall to-day under the auspices: of the
Tammany Society. Grand Sachem James
A. O'Gorman. Justice of the Supreme
Court, delivered the address of welcome.
There were two "long talks," the first by
former Senator Charles A. Towne of Min
nesota, the other by Senator J. W. Bailey
of Texas.
Towne made a Dlea for "the old Amer
icanism." He held that the Government
had departed from the high ideal of its
founders, and committed a crime against
the Declaration of Independence and the
constitution bv its treatment of the Fili
pinos. The constitution, he contended,
nowhere Drovided for a colonial system.
He Eaid:
This new policy of colonization is trying to
masquerade in the borrowed -garments of
Democracy. It has labeled itÂ«elf "Expansion,"
but the disguise Is transparent. The new pol

and healthful growth of an organism. The
Imperialistic procÂ«cs of enlargement is by the
extraneous grafting of alien and unsympathetic
tissue, between which and the parent life thsre
can never be any organic relation.
The tendencies that, under the party In pow
er, have led to a repudiation of the Declaration
of Independence ami- Â» a partial Imperializa
tion of the constitution, have naturally pro
duced a corresponding revolution in the tra
ditions of the Government. Ths corruption

Tom L. Johnson. Mayor of Cleveland, was
the principal speaker. Howard S. Taylor.
City Prosecuting Attorney of Chicago,
also spoke.
Eryan Introduced Johnson, who took as
his subject "Local Self-Govemment," and
th'-:, devoted hlÂ» speech almost wholly to
his tvorSi In Ohio. The JeJTersonian doc
trine of equal rights for all and special
privileges for none was the speaker's key
note. In Cleveland, ho said, he and his
fii*-r.<lÂ£, supponrd by a majority of the
people there, were striving to secure to
all the people of the municipality equal
rights. That was tne kind of practical
nvrk. he proceeded, which needed most to
be done at the present time.
"For." said he, "if our municipalities.

HONESTY IN PUBLIC SERVICE.
In conclusion Moody touched upon the
necessity of honesty In the public service.
Th*re was. he declared, no disease of the
body politic eo subtle, so powerful, so
dangerous, so fatal as the corrupt be
trayal of a public trust, whether the trust
be great or small. He could not but be
lieve, he said, that in the main those who
did the people's work were honest and
true, but when the malignant ulcer -of
I corruption appeared It was no time for
Hurfac*Â» treatment. Tho knife must reach
under the very poisonous' root, that each
might be cut out and cast away. He
asked that wo not easily believe charges
which were made lightly.
"Let them," the Secretary added, "be
investigated with the calm Impartiality of
a court of law; but if the offense be
proved let the displeasure of the people
come like a thunderbolt from on high.
Let not the hands of justice be stayed or
Its edicts be tempered with misguided
mercy." <
â¢ Tho remainder of the programme in
cluded music by the United States marine
land and Hinging by an adult chorus, a
chorus of school children and by the audi- ]
ri.ee. This was the first time a ceremony
of this character has been held on the
White House grounds.
Secretary Moody spoke of the equality
of all men before the law and held that
the laws, which were enforced equally for
and against all, should be respected by
all. The remedy for any wrong should
be sought under the law and in the
rourts, which represented the majesty of
thfj people's will. Any departure from
thi3 sound principle in any part pt the
land was a contempt not only of the
rourts themselves, but of the people who
had created the courts. He added:
Secretary Moody made an address In
teha'.f of the National Government. He
reminded his hearers that without the co
operation of the French fleet under De
Grasse the victory over Cornwallis at
Yorktown. which virtually determined the
Independence of the colonies, would never
have been won. Briefly the Secretary
dwelt upon the circumstances of our his
tory, if we would k*ep what we have
won, if v.-e would maintain and strength
en our position among the nations, he
said, we should purify the sources of na
tional life and guard well the qualities
upon which our continued strength as a
nation depend. In a government in which
all the people equally participate uni
versal Intelligence is demanded; without
it government by the people must be a
failure.
The fight for better things is an endless one;
we shall fight It. you and we. with eyea fixed
on the earr.e idea!â the very same marked out
by our ancestors long agoâ and our flags will
move en. always toward the light; and while
we follow them we shall bs pleased to-remem
ber that If their denlgns are different, vet they
diKpiay over our beads the same colors."
SECRETARY MOODY'S SPEECH.
These dut!Â«f> we have in common with you.
Endowed with institutions similar to yours,
pursuing elmiiar a!tns. we Intend to vie with
you no longer on the battlefield. In view of a
liberty which has been won forever, but in
constant attempt* to improve the condition of
the mar.y. to spread the spirit of brotherhood
between men and between nations; to remain,
in a word, true to the principles proclaimed
in ycur revolution and in ours.
Ambassador Jusserand then made a
speech, paying eloquent tribute to the
Americans of the early days. He referred
to the he!p which France so willingly ren
dered the new republic in its struggle for
freedom. Congress had decided that. an
appeal should be made to the foreign na
tions for an alliance. Amid the silence of
nations one voice, he said, was heard to
say "Adsum"â the voice of France. He
concluded as follows:
The natlcn r.hcse life began 127 yeara ago
has become an immense one and eyes are more
and more fixed upon her. On the day we now
eommfrir.orate <!n a ceremony to which I am be
>*ond words proud to be associated) your an
cestors bestowed upen you gifts and framed
for you duties, the ones and the others equal
ly t-piendld. Th*y bestowed upon you that
pÂ«-erleÂ« giftâ liberty: they left fcr you rulis
of life, obligation* and responsibilities which
will beccire more and more binding as you be
come more and more powerful.
The parade was witnessed by large
crowds and was reviewed by General S.
M. B. Youdj, the grand marshal. ' It

President Roosevelt, accompanied by
Mrs. Roosevelt and a party of about
thirty, left Sagamore Hill pier shortly
; after 2 o'clock on board the navy yacht
Sylph. The Sylph was Immediately pre
ceded to Huntington Bay by the steam
yacht Belle Moore, having on board her
owner, Samuel T. Shaw of New York and
the members of the Oyster Bay Board of
Trade.
On the arrival of the Sylph the Belje
Moore saluted President Roosevelt with
twenty-one guns. As the President landed
I at the pier in Huntington harbor he was
I greeted by Joseph Irwin. chairman of the
reception committee, and he and his yarty
were escorted in carriages to the town,
two miles away. The harbor presented a
beautiful sight as the party landed, be
ing alive wjth pleasure craft of ell sorts,
including a dozen large steam yachts, all
in holiday dresa.
Arriving at the stand erected in the
center ot the town. President Roosevelt
j was accorded an ovation. The welcoming
address was delivered by William McKln
ney and to this the President responded.
At the conclusion of the address three
rousing cheers were given for "Neighbor
Roosevelt." The President and his party
entered carriages and returned Immedi
ately to the pier, boarded the Sylph and
fteamed for home, arriving at Sagamore
j Hill sJfortly after 7 o'clock.
The President spoke as follows:
In greeting alt of you I wish to say a
word of ri>eclal greeting to those whom no
i others will object to my greeting first, to the
men because of whom we have to-day a coun
try and a President, to the men of the Grand
Army, and I thank the men of the National
Guard wearing the uniform I have worn my
self for having turned out to serve as my es
cort to-day.
After paying a tribute to the bravery
and devotion of the men in blue and talk
ing strongly for good ' citizenship, the
President continued:
The cloistered virtu* is net th* virtue that
I counts in our American life. The virtue that
counts Is the virtue that is able to hold lta own
in the hurly burly of actual life. We need
j In civil life Just as much as ever It was nÂ«*d
| *d In military life, as ever it v.as needed In
the time of the great Civil War. the robust
power which were against wrong instead of
insuring It.
The other day r spoke at the dedication of a
monument to the sailors who followed Dewey
into Manila Bay. I spoke by the side of the
Pacific Ocean in the great city of San Fran
cisco. We ctraÂ« there to speik proudly togeth
[ fr as Americans because on that first of May
flve years ago our people had won In one of
those fiirhts which have a far-reaching effect
oh ail history.
Why were we able to join together in pride
and Joy to commemorate that great riet-d of
five years before? Partly because of the valor,
the -seamanship, the rklll and prowess dis
played on that tlrst of May by ths men la the
ships that sailed into Manila Hay. but partly
also because there had been the wisdom which
made ready that fleet in advance. At present
there is. not a cloud as big as a hand's breadth
on the horizen. We are on terms of good will
with all the peoples of mankind. I think that
they feel well disposed toward us. I want a
good navy, not as a. provocative of war tfut
as a guaranty against war. I want It as th
cheapest Insurance of peace I want to sÂ»e
reace always with this country, but the peace
that comes not to the coward who flinches
from the fight, but the Just man armed, who
will neither wrong the weak nor suffer wrong
from the strong. I think that Is good Ameri
canism and sound common sense. â¢
We only need a small regular army, but we
need a first-cUes navy, a navy equal to the
position we have in the world, and it Is abso
lutely neceteary that we should keep on with
the building up of that navy, that we should
keep the navy that we have at the highest
point of efficiency in ships. In guns, the men I
in them and behind them. Then w9w 9 shall go j
steadily on along the course we have'mapp^d 'Â¦
out for ourselves a* a people. j

on that May morning in 1808 was flashed around
the world the news of Dewey's great naval vic

citizen were turned toward this land by the

o'clock one of the best parades ever seen
here passed through the principal streets.
The naval reserves, . Red Men in Indian
costumes, Columbia Park Cadets of San

floats and floral decorations made up the
long line.
: After the procession literary exercises
were held at the armory. The oration, by
Bishop Thomas Conaty, was a masterly
one and patriotic. In the afternoon an
other parade was followed by games and
races at thÂ« beach and concerts by the
three bands. This evening there was a
great display of fireworks. There wer*
also concerts on the beach and a dance at

of the day. Father Kenna delivered the
invocation. An original poem by George

The Hon. J.' R. Knowland of Alameda

There was no lack of enthusiasm. A
couple of thousand Native Sons and
Daughters of the Golden West Joined in
the celebration. The morning was a sort
of a reception to the visitors. Shortly
after 11 o'clock the parade, with H. A.
Pflster as grand marshal, began to move.
It consisted of four divisions and was the
largest pageant ever seen \n the college
town. There were about 3000 persons in
line. Miss Clara Roll, the Goddess of
Liberty, occupied a throne on a beautiful
float of green. Societies and firemen from
nearly every town along the peninsula
were represented in line.

were in the historic mission town. No
better place could be selected in the val

DISCOVERY OF GOLD.
On July 7. 184*â and It should have been
on July 4â the banner of enlightenment and
progress was unfurled over the old Custom
house at Monterey, and a new era dawned for
California. Oth4r flags had been raised and
lowered over this historic building, but the
Stars and Stripes, the Insignia of the mighty
American nation, when once flunj to the
breeie, was there to remain, to be displaced
by the emblem of no nation upon the face cf
the globe. -'.-. -
Great changes were continually taking place
In this "land of easy miracles." as It has been
termed, and world history was being made.
The sovereignty of Spain gave way to the sov
ereignty of Mexico, and rulers changed with
bewildering rapidity. In 1834 R. H. Dana
Jr. visited this coast and declared that Cali
fornia was at the ends of the earth â a country
where there was neither law nor gospel. But
this chaotic condition was soon to end and a
stable government to be established.
The lives of those devoted padres are an in
spiration. In that city of the southland,
whose shores are kissed by the waters of San

landed In 1761), and from that period, enduring
hardships which tongue cannot describe, they
struggled on unfalteringly until the last link
In the chain of twenty-one missions had been
completed. Civilization followed in the wake
of thÂ« Franciscans, and the history of the
Far West began.
foundation of "this future commonwealth.
It is particularly fining that we should as
semble !n this city, which bears the name of
one of those historic old missions-, and under
the auspices of the Native' Sons or this now
(treat commonwealth, to celebrate tht one
hundred -and twenty-seventh anniversary of
our nation's birth. This occasion and these
environments call to mind the fact that In the
history of this mighty nation our State has
played a most Important part, and It would
seem propitious at this time to touch upon
those events In the history of California which
have been far-reaching In their effects, influ
encing national policies. Awaken an Interest
In local history and you instill Into the hearts
of the people a love of State, stimulating a pa

Affidavits of members of "the wrecking
crew stated that some of_the cars were
found Jn a cornfield 200 yards from -the
track, and that the track was Intact and
In good shape after the accident. On
.'July 8 'the Galveston, Harrisburg and
' San Antonio j asked authority to repair
the two damaged cars at the Erie's ex
pense." which was refused.: The bill of the
Erie for the value of the destroyed car
was returned unpaid by "the Galveston.
Harrisburg and ..San Antonio, as It
' claimed that the car was destroyed
through no fault whatever, on its part,
v but the two damaged cars were subse
quently repaired and no . bfll " rendered.
The Erie claimed that the Weather Bu
reau report for June 27 showed nothing
In tf?e weather conditions â¢ that would
cause such damage and that the accident
must have been from some other cause.
The bill for the^ destroyed car was pre
sented, to the arbitration committee with
! the evidence on both sides,, and Its dccla
i Ion was that the' bill of tho Erie should
b^- paid. -It was made on. the grounds
that' the preface to the : rules of Inter
change j provides that . railroad companies
handling cars aro responsible for damage

RESPONSIBILITY FOR
DAMAGE BY CYCLONE
Professor Thomas of Columbia Univer
sity has discussed in the June number of
the Popular Science Monthly nearly 20,
000 records, of college graduates with re
spect to their age at graduation. The
general belief Is that the American boy
takes his A. B. degree. a good deal older
than his father took his and a great deal
older than " did . his,, grandfather. The
data lead to the conclusion that the in
crease in" age has been much exaggerated.
It exists only for certain institutions,
while others jshow a decrease. The nor
mal age at graduation Is about 22'Â£ yearsi
If entrance into professional life Is later
than formerly the reasons must be sought
elsewhere, than .In the. college.- ...It Is, how
ever, no longer possible, as It once was,
for a lad to-take his degree "at lti years
of age. But the young man now leaves
college with very much higher attain
ments than his father or grandfather pos
sessed. . Â¦ * _ ; f..' :...'- ',,

Sugared Timber.
Among new uses to which sugar has re
cently been put is In the preservation of
timber. Much interest has beecn aroused
by the* announcement, as the result of a
prolonged scries of experiments, of a
method of so treating timber as to secure,
even from soft wood, a largely increased
toughness and hardness. . The treatment
to which the timber Is subjected Â» is,
roughly speal^ng, that of saturation tat
boiling point with a solution of sugar, the
water being afterward evaporated at' a
high temperature. The result is to leave
the pores and Interstices of the wood
filled In with solid matter and the timber
vulcanized, preserved and seasoned; The
nature of moderately soft wood, It "Is
claimed, is In this way changed to a tough
and hard" substance, without brittleness,
and also without any tendency to splitor
crack.â London Globe.

ALL ot the get rich quick concerns get rich quick themselves through the prevalence oi cre
dulity, the universality of the. gambling spirit and the desire to get . something for nothing.
Horace Grecley said the saddest moment in a young man's life was not when he lost his
father or his mother, or writhed in the pangs of unrequited love, but was when he took a
dollar that he had not earned. All of the buck etshop business of the different produce exchanges;,
the betting at races on private tips; the losses in stocks through getting a "hunch," depend upon
credulity and the desire to get something for nothing. Somebody gets it, but not the credulous
investor.
There is recently disclosed a painful case of credulity in which unfortunately the innocent and
defenseless suffer with the credulous and the foolish. A pseudo medium in Southern California saw
piles of gold iii, Central/ American soil and stone, and a considerable party of men, women and chil
dren packed off in: search of the treasure/ They were "spiritually guided" to the midst of a poison
tropical forest, twenty miles* from the coast in. Guatemala, where the only "color"' they found was
yellow fever, and where even the natives are a race of mosquito-bitten and malaria smitten pariahs.
These credulous fortune-seekers had but little when they started out on this fool's errand, and now
they are. marooned in the tropics with nothing" to support them there and nothing to take
them away. . . : Â¦ â¢
If only those responsible were suffering' the case would hot be so bad, but among them are a
number of small children, who were dragged; into the forest to perish. The spiritual guidance has
ceased and its victims will mostly cease, too, before they can get back. The press should give as wide
circulation to this great-folly as possible, but the lesson will be lost upon the kind of people who have
furnished it. The seers, and revelators of hidden. treasure will find material upon which to ply their
trade as long as there arc in the world people looking for the quick fortune and willing to touch, the
dollar unearned. ; ': "
THE PREVALENCE OF CREDULITY.
JULY is young yet, but seems determined that the months preceding shall not excel it in the
sensations produced by natural and artificial causes. Named for the great Julius who shook
thc world from the Indus to the Scheldt, and so shone in all positions that he assumed and
all places that knew his presence that his personality will be embossed upon the world until
the firmament is rolled up like a scroll, this month of July not only has monopolized the anniver
sary of American independence, the fall of the Bastile, the battle of the Boyne, the fall of Vicksburg
and Santiago, and the nativity of the Dominion of Canada, "Our Lady of the Snows," but has also
in these first days furnished human calamity enough to surfeit the wires.
There are July snows in Montana, killing heat and lightning in New York, men and beasts
struck dead by the sun in Philadelphia and Washington, people drowned in, cloudbursts. in Texas,
chilly weather in Chicago, cyclones in Iowa blowing buildings aiid humanity into giblets, grass
hoppers eating all the grass in Montana that is not under snowdrifts, and floods in the Southern
rivers sweeping crops and houses down streams.
In California there are forest fires at Guernevillc. grain fires at Davisville, Dixon. Stockton
and other points. Angels Camp is nearly burned up. A hot wind from the north has thinned our fruit
and shelled the standing grain. A miner lit his pipe with his Davy lamp in AVyoming and blew up
the mine, killing 200. Since the first of the month there have been three lynchings, and it seems as
if the month of Julius, like him, proposes to have no rival in the calendar as an object of
human interest.
If the rest of it is to keep up the record may the days pass quickly, that we may enter the
month of the' gentler Augustus, who was not so great a figure but a better politician than his uncle.
He was to Julius what Van Bitren was to Jackson, and his namesake month partakes of his charac
teristics. Give us, then, August and the dog star, to let us rest after these windy, fiery, watery and

P. D. Keim and hi* son Clyde of Rand.
Colo., says the Scientific American, went
upon a mountain hunting trip last sum
mer. While the party was ascending a
steep incline a storm came up. As he
walked into a clearing the elder Keim
mat struck by lightning. Nearly every
article of clothing that he wore was torn
â¢off; even his shoes were stripped from his
feet. His son Clyde, who was about fifty
feet away, wai also struck. He regained
consciousness, and. despite the fact that
one elde was paralyzed, he managed to
<rawl t* hiÂ» father, whom he supposed
deadâ pulling himself along by. means of
the long trrass. using but one hand and
arm. When he reached nis father he
fodnd that he had not be;n killed. For
tunately, the remaining members of the
party came up and worked over the un
conscious man for two hours, finally suc
ceeding in reviving him.

She resembles an ancient cy

fragments of architecture that remind us

Minor such relics meet the eye of the
traveler at every step, while on the Eu

wonderful that the people who were con- .
temporary with Pharaoh and Cyrus
should survive in undiminished vitality
snd demand to be reckoned with our
Ktatctmen of to-day? In lieu of broken
arrhes or crumbling walls is presented
the accompanying view combining the
permanent and the ephemeral. The per
manent elements are this noble river
<Tang-tse-Kiang>, the longest in Asia,
and the hills on its banks, which, though
not remarkable for height, are prominent
features in the scenery. The more fragile
â¢ Icmcnts are two pagodas, which have
nothing permanent but their style.
These are so perishable that it would
l.e safe to assert that they have renewed
their youth a dozen times within the last
T000 yearsâ reappearing each time as a
fresh print from an old block, so that the
present pagodas seen in the accompany
ing illustrations are exact reproductions
of those occupying the same site centur
ies ago. One cf them in factâ that which
overlooks the river â is just now rising
from a bed of ashes into which it was
transformed by a. spark from a fire
cracker. In front of it Is a pretty little
iowÂ«?r of solid stone, said to be In the
style of Thibet, crowning the principal
gate of this city (Wuchang). They have
ihe advantage of rising from the extrem
ity of a long hill, whose backbone, the
Chinese say, was broken by the impetuous
flood.
A chief feature of this locality â one that
ha* made it the symposium of Central
Chinaâ is the junction of the river Han,
which flows into the larger stream at a
point nearly opposite this pagoda. Han
kow owes 5tÂ» existence to this fact, as its
name Indicatesâ signifying the "Mouth of
Han." On the other bank of the Han
stands the city of Hongkong, the two,
with Hanyang, forming a trio somewhat
Jike the three great cities that have
sprung up at the mouth of the Hudson.
Our earliest notice of this locality dates
back 4S00 years, to the days when Yu
Wong, that model engineer, opened the
water courses and drained the fields after
the occurrence cf a flood which the Chi
nese compare to that of Noah or Deu
calion. Nine years were spent in the task
and it is said that, although he thrice
passed his own door, he never stopped to
'sleep at homeâ so absorbed was he by the
" magnitude of his enterprise! In recom
pense for this achievement he was raised
to the imperial throne.
Fifty years ago last week may almost
be said to have been the birthday of
modern American railroading, for on May
17, 1853, the New York Central Railroad
was. incorporated, and shortly afterward
took over the components of the first im
portant railroad consolidation. Prior to
that period the traveler from New York
westward worked his way up the Hudson
by boat or by the Hudson River Railroad,
then a powerful Independent line, and
then headed fcr Buffalo via a group of
ten little roads operated on more or less
discordant terms, according to circum
stances, and with difficulty managing to
irhuftie passengers across the State. "West
of Buffalo the outlook for progress 'was
harder still. It was another and an
earlier era In transportation, and it is al
most impossible for us now to realize how
incomplete and weak were the links that
bound together the interests of the con
tinent. . Still harder is It to realise that it
was fourteen years later before the rail
route from New York to Buffalo was un
der one coherent management. Evtn
then the ways of travel were crude; in
deed, the sleeping car v.-as almost an un
known quantity, and the hapless traveler
was shuffled from car to car along his
devious way in a fashion that would now
lead to riot. If the virtues at consolida
tion are anywhere more consplcu<nis than
in the promotion of through railway traf
fic, we have yet to find the place. To
day travel is a pleasure instead of a bur
den, and the coast is nearer then was the
Mississippi a generation ago., It is the
shrewd and wise enterprise that formed
the New York Central which set the pace
for future develonment and' has enabled
the .nation to grow without losing com
mon Interests, and to develop a homoge
neous whole. No cne man or railroad can
claim all the credit, but the New York
Central has been a road of rare irn^-jr
tance In the national growth.
Professor John Milne. the wcll-knnwn
seismologist, has published pome inter
esting facts concerning the crust and in
terior of the earth At the present time
it is only possible to Imagine the forma
tion of the earths crust from the stiata
present in the jnatttr thrown out by vol
canoes. How thick the earth's cru!Â«t i*
we do not know, but as it Is an estab
lished fact that earthquakes and similar
earth tremors pass right round the
v.-orld. through the Interior in waves, it
Is possible to deduce the medium they
have traversed by their quality and veloc
ity According to Professor Milne, . the
denser this medium the greater is the
speed of the propagation of the waves,
varying from 3 kilometers to ?.3 kilome
ters per second, the, velocity increasing
the nearer the course of the wave to the
earth's center. Assuming the world to
weigh more than five and a half times
an ecual bulk of water. Professor Milne
concludes that a lighter crust of approxi
mately 200 miles and a denser medium
fairly uniform and about five and a half
times the density of water would satisfy
the seismolcglcal conditions. To such a
core as this, which would be somewhat
lighter than iron, he hn.^ supplied the
special name of "g^Ite." and continues to
explain that what seiamologlcal observa
tions lead us to suspect Is that beneath
the lighter crust there is a magnetic me
dium of greater density, which during
penetration slowly passes into a fairly
homogeneous "geite." and he anticipates
that it will be possible in time to deduce
the physical and chemical composition of
the white-hot matter i:i the interior of the
earth with the same certainty that we
now know the composition of the various
bodies of the solar system.'

Mr. Hutton..by forsaking the authori
ties and the guides has succeeded In gath
errng together an agreeable cento of anec
dotes from Investigations, personally con
ducted, through hundreds of volumes of
local history, biography, autobiography,
correspondence and reminiscence. .
Here. Is a letter that mlgnt have been
written In this century and in this coun
try by President Wilson of Princeton ;.- by
President Eliot of Harvard, or. by Presi
dent Hadley of Yale. In point of fact It
was written early in the seventeenth cen
tury by Archbishop Abbott of Oxford,
England. It Is addressed to the under
graduates of All Souls*, and it says:
"The feast, of : Christmas drawing now
to an end doth put one in mind of the
great outrage which., as I was Informed,
was last year committed In your college,
where, although matters had formerly
been conducted with some distemper, yet
men did never before break .into such In
tolerable liberty as'.to t tear down "doors
and gates and disquiet their neighbors,
as if it had been a. camphor a town In
war." *. ...
We all know that Arthur Penryhn Stan
ley was the original Tom great
est '"'.friend; . Arthur. We all know that
Tom" Brown was ; Tom Hughes himself.
Therefore'Mr. Hutton springs a surprise
upon us when he quotes from a letter
vrltten by Dean Stanley, In 1360:
"Oxford's ignorance of Oxford." he-com
plains, "is in many respects phenomenal
and startling: and a book might easily be
written about 'what Oxford does not
know about Oxford.' In too many trying,
exasperating instances, the only difference
between the authorities and the local per
sonally conducted guides is the fact that
the authorities know less, at no pecuniary
expense to the Inquirer, than do the
guides know for the regulation fees. But
while the authorities are generally and
frankly uncertain/ the guides are almost
universally incorrect. The authorities
rarely assert. The guides invariably in
vent." '
This is the latest and also the freshest
and most unique of Laurence . Hutton's
anecdotal histories of famous literary
centers. If we are to take Mr. Hutton's
word for It. there is no place which will
find it fresher and more unique than Ox
ford Itself.
Sir Lewis Morris, a new edition of
whose poems is now coming out. is an
other instance of the close association of
literature and law. of which the history
of letters offers so many examples. Sir
Lewis pactked for a number of years at
the Chancery- Bar. chiefly 'as, a convey
ancing counsel. The drafting or perusing
of documents of title Is not usually es
teemed a very exhilarating ocupation. al
though it is recorded of one old convey
ancer that he occasionally came across
a brilliant deed. Uninteresting though
conveyancing may in general be. it did
not prevent Sir Lewis Morris cultivating
the poetic muse with much success.

THE news that J. M. Barrle is to
be represented in London by a
third play calls attention to the
extent to which he has deserted
literature for the drama. Mr.
Barr'.e's first essay in dramatic
composition was in 1891. but his first suc
cess wan attained in the production by
Mr. Toole of a little skit on Ibsen. In
the last twelve years Mr. Barrie has pub
lished only four books, whereas in the
preceding four years he published seven.
Since 1S90, on the other hand, he has
He was admired, he was respected, he
was loved, he was gently satirized. One
of the most popular and 'possibly one of
the most apocrypal of the stories that
were told about him was to this effect:
A certain irreverent and waggish under
graduate was once, showing visitors
around Ballol College.
"There la the library." said he. "there
the chapel: there is the buttery; ther* Is
the master's lodge, and there"â throwing
a stone through the window of the lodge,
at which the surprised and indignant
Jowett at once appearedâ "and there Is
the master himself."
One of the most familiar and one of the
most distinguished figures In Oxford of,
late years, nnd for many years, was that
cf Benjamin Jowett. lie was student,
fellow, tutor, professor and master of
Baiiol. Entering with a scholarship from
St. Paul's in JSS6. he was intimately as
sociated with Oxford until he died. In 1S3C.
His fellow students, hla pupils and hi3

I THE WRITING OF BOOKS FOR THE BUILDING OF PLAYS. IN

Our merchants expected great advantages to follow China's participation in the St. Louis fair.
Mr.' Barrett was sent to Peking to secure it. Tsi An gave out of her private purse nearly half a mil
lion to aid the exhibit. The Chinese colleges and technical schools were interested and were resorted
to to secure the skilled workmen and the intelligence required in installing and maintaining the ex
hibit. There is no doubt that it would have been one of the most novel, interesting and useful of all
the exhibits. Just now we needed to. encourage China in making it. We needed in all ways to show
our friendship toward the commercial classes of a country which can easily take all the surplus prod
ucts of California and pay welt for it.
Rut a shadow has fallen upon a prospect in which California is so vitally interested. Dictated
by that mistaken sentiment here which identifies all Chinese with the coolies whose exclusion we
desire, the treasury regulations for control of the Chinese who must accompany the exhibit put upon
them the brand of ignominy, treat them as prisoners from the moment they land, put them under
bonds, under police supervision, confine them to the grounds of the exhibit and brand them with in
feriority and inequality among the nationals of many countries who will be there.
The only possible way of changing this is by a representation from the commercial bodies of
this State. The few hundred Chinese wlio must follow the exhibit would make no harmful impres
sion if they should all stay after it^ is over. But they do not come to stay. They will return. They
come as students of our affairs and to study all nations in their exhibits. We invited them by spe
cial embassy, and it is to make a spectacle of ourselves if we treat them as prisoners when they come:
There is no industrial or legal necessity for such treatment. The regulations are in supposed re
sponse to public sentiment here, and the' authorities at Washington should be at once undeceived.
China acquiesces in our policy of excluding coolies, but if her trade is worth seeking or her
people deserving to be our guests at this fair, they will resent the humiliation put upon -them -by
these regulations. .
The people that come to install the Chinese exhibit are entitled to the same freedom of action,
the same mobility, as those of the other nations we have invited to be our guests. In that way we may
retain the hold we now have on the friendship and trade of China. By unnecessary humiliation we will
lose it, and deserve to. Whether we want Chinese trade or want to throw it away will be shown by
the action of our merchants and our rhembcrs of Congress in advising the Government at Wash
ington in this matter. -
CALIFORNIA has the greatest interest in Chinese trade. China is to us what all Europe is
to the Atlantic seaports of the country. There is nothing for us in India, but little in the
Straits Settlements, less in the Dutch East Indies and bare pickings in French Cochin
China. Japan is able to supply most of her own wants and is ambitious to do so. . Her
food supply is ample and will for years to come keep up with the increase of her population. China,
with 425.000.000 people., already grown beyond her own food supply, just ready to emerge into con
ditions that imply new wants which we may supply, is our field.
Why are we nettled at the lying and intrigue of Russia? The reason is not sentimental. It is
commercial. It is selfish. We know that left alone China will give us the open door in Manchuria;
while, put under duress by Russia, our trade will be excluded. In China, England, France and Ger
many all enjoy advantages superior to ours. They own coast points. They have extensive zones of
influence. They are on the ground., and though their base of supplies is farther from the demand
and consumption than ours, they overcome that by possession of points of advantage. The ukase of
the Czar, issued three years ago, made it. perfectly plain that whenever Russia controlled a Chinese
port it would be closed* to all except Russian ships and Russian trade. Therefore we arc angered at
Russia for her Chinese policy, because we want our share of that trade, and California wants it
more than any other part of thc;Union.' â¢

They were not the work of one or of sev

began, with the glossesâ that is,- the ex
planations in easy Latin or Englishâ of
hard Latin words, written by the monks
between the lines of the manuscripts. The
glosses grew Into translations, and col
lections of glosses by this monk or that
from all the sources available to him
made glossaries or dictionaries. Little
by little English supplanted the easy Lat
in explanations, and the words were ar
ranged in a rudimentary alphabetical or
der, thus forming, so long ago as 1000 A.

Scientists have speculated in vain as to
the use of the boomerang among these
Indians. No other tribes of the West pr
Southwest use this weapon, which has
figured so long 4 In the. history of the
Pueblos. Some scientists have claimed
that the boomerang shows the Pueblos to
be descendants of some of the remote
Asiatic tribes that used similar weapons.
This, however, Is regarded as mere specu
lation, though the ancestry' of the Pueb
los, as well as of several other tribes of
the Southwest, Is so shrouded in darkness
that one guess Is seemingly as good as
another. At. any rate, tho Pueblos can
not be Induced to part with their ancient
and favorite weapon. They use tho im
proved agrcultural Implements of tho
white man, but they have no use for the
white man's gun. They cling to the
boomerang in prefernce to the revolver or
the repeating rifle, and in all probability
this primitive weapon wjll be in use as
long as the Pueblos exist as a nation.â
New York Tribune.
The real featufci' of an Indian rabbit
hunt Is the dexterity shown by individual
boomerang hunters. A 16-year-old boy,
straight as. an arrow and as lithe as a
young panther, will frighten a rabbit
from a clump of sagebrush. To the eye
of the Inexperienced there is no rabbit
there, but the Indian lias "not been de
ceived. As eoon as the jackrabbit Btarts
from his place of concealment and goes
in long bounds, which speedily carry him
away from an ordinary enemy, the Indian
youth gives a shrill cry nnd draws back
the hand holding the deadly boomerang.
Like a baseball pitcher he poises for an
instant, and thep. with an overhand
swing, the boomerang Is sent forth, cut
ting the air with a' swish, and almost in
variably sending the rabbit head over
heels. Inasmuch as the sportsman must
manifest a fair degree of skill with the
shotgun to shoot a Jackrabbit when it is
well underway, the precision necessary
to kill one of the animals with a club can
be readily understood. The average white
boy, however he . may pride himself on
his skill in throwing the baseball, would
owe it .purely to luck should be bring
down a Jackrabbit with a boomerang.
Yet an Indian' boy thinks nothing of
killing ten or a dozen rabbits in a day's
hunt and not having a single miss scored
against "him.
KILLING JACKRABBITS.
The Pueblo Indians, the most civilized
of all Southwestern tribes, have suffered
severely owing to the depredations of
rabbits. The Pueblos are expert farmers.
They had the science of Irrigation at their
finger tips before the Spaniards first in
vaded America. . To-day their Irrigated
farms are models which the white man
can follow to good advantage. Conse
quently these aboriginal farmers have
taken to rabbit hunting not only for
sport but as a means of self-protection.
The, Indians when hunting rabbits scat
ter over a broad area with shrill cries
that frighten the rabbits from their bur
rows, and then the well-aimed boomer
angs never fall to bring down the leaping
animals. Where a rabbit refuses to come
from his burrow the Indian boys gather
about with sharpened sticks and die un
til the animal Is forced to make- a break
for liberty. The Indian dogs have their
share in' the hunt, of course, and the
scene is a stirring one as the tribesmen
scurry over tho plain; -searching every
arroyo for Ihrklng rabbit's. - '
The Indians begin practicing throwing
the boomerang at an early age. Mere in
fants can be seen on the sagebrush plat
eaus, imitating their larger brothers and
sisters and hurling tiny sticks at each
other, shouts of glee going up as some
particularly clever shot' Is made. Some
of the older Indians manifest a degree of
skill with the boomerang which Is little
short of amazing. It is a common sight
to see a skilled boomerang thrower bring
down a bird on the wing, and to miss a
Jackrabbit in the open is ..uie short of
a disgrace. The ranblt hunts, which are
held every winter, are made the occasion
of festivities in the pueblos of the tribes.
The . Indians have peculiar dances in
which they indulge Just before the arrival
of a rabbit hunt day. -These rabbit hunt
ing dances vary little from the deer and
corn dances and other picturesque cere
monials of the tribe.
The New Mexican boomerang throwers
have been using this, primitive weapon
for countless . generations." When the
Spaniards first penetrated New Mexico
in search of gold in the mining districts
of tho territory the Pueblos were using
the .boomerang almost exclusively as I a
weapon. The Pueblo Indian boy to-day
occasionally snllies forth with his bow
and arrow, but most of the tribe stick to
the ancient boomerang, especially when
at their favorite sport of rabbit hunting.
The boomerang is no.t, properly speaking,
the returning boomerang of the Austra
lian savages, but is a variation of that
deadly instrument.' It Is simply a curved
club, which is thrown - with wonderful
skill and precision by the Pueblo Indians,
even to the smallest boys and girls.

The Santa Clara Pueblo Indians recent
ly held a. rabbit -hunt of enormous propor

ing, the summer she is quite willing to

Busy, wealthy parents who desire their
children to expand mentally and physi

perhaps to work on lines denied to them
during their childhood, prefer a college

WORKING FOR A MILLIONAIRE.
Frequently girls of small incomes club
tcgether and camp out in the wooda of
Maine or other picturesque sections of
New England, living an outdoor life at
an extremely low figure and gaining
strength to take up "coaching" during
the opening months of the school term.
Even a chaperon Is dispensed with by
these strictly modern camping parties,
and they live as simply and frugally as
men do under similar circumstances.
CAMPING IN THE WOODS.
A New England girl has doubly solved
the problem of summer employment by
using both her newly acquired stock of
learning and her ancestral farm. The
latter Is a picturesque but barren hillside
in the heart of the Berkshlres with an
cld-fashioned, rambling house. Here she
gathered the .members of her summer
ciass for a month's work, combined de
lightfully with outdoor life. Her mother
acted as chaperon and- was a capable
housekeeper \ for the family of eight. A
neighbor's boy did the rough work and
tended the garden, which supplied' fresh
fruit and vegetables for the table.
Some of the pupils had their cycles, and
horses,could be hired at reasonable rates
from neighboring farmers. Fishing and
boating were enjoyed on a pond at the
foot of the hill and the woods abounded in
wild berrlea and "specimens.",' Certain
hours r were set aside, for studying and
reaching and nothing was allowed to In
terfere with the work, though Eienox was
.enticingly near.
When the first month was over, several
or" the girls decided to remain longer and
were Joined by other friends, and, though
"coaching" was abandoned, mother and
daughter made a substantial sum from
their summer boarders. This year they
will conduct, the summer school on a
larger scale and the- farm, which hitherto
had grudgingly yielded enough to pay
the taxes, will now help to put the girl
through college.
The member of a college or school fac
ulty whose daughter has failed or been
conditioned feels personally disgraced
and will make almost any sacrifice to
have her properly coached during the
summer. He does not coach her himself
for two reasonsâ first, because she may
have failed In a branch remotely removed
from the line he teaches, and, second,
because the student who has just passed
the examinations ln which hia daughter
failed Is up-to-date on the topic and
posted on "trick" questions.
CONDITIONAL STUDENTS.
The young woman who Is determined
to work her way through the four-year
college course regards . the summer vaca
tion as a vertitable harvest time; with
dollars for her crop. From the middle of
June until the middle of September she
executes those little triumphs of inge
nuity v/hieh Dave . the way for nine
months more at her beloved Institution
of learning. If she Is wise as well as in
genious, she has her plans made before
the college ' doors shut for the vacation
period.
Naturally, she first turns her attention
to lines of work ln which she can make
use of the learning acquired during the
past, term. One of the most popular
means of raising funds Is "coaching"
students in the same college who have
been "conditioned" or have failed utterly
ln their examinations. Strangely enough,
the majority of these summer pupils are
not drawn from the homes of the
wealthy; they are not girls whose Interest
ln social matters has Interfered with
their work, but children of college pro
fessors and educationists. Just as the
sons of Industrial magnates frequently
develop into most Irresponsible business
men, so the children of very learned men
show a singular inaptitude for the arts
and sciences.
With this approach of commencement
day the all-important Question .which
comes to the graduate is, "What shall I
wear?" The self-sustaining undergrad
ulate faces a more difficult, and serious
problem, "How can I support myself
through the vacation and lay aside some
thing toward my. expenses for next
term?"

crowded the erand stands and watched
the athletes strive for prizes. The races
were highly exciting. There was dancing
by the kilted laddies ' and laesles. The
judges were impartial in: their decisions.
The applause that greeted the contestant*
repaid them when there were not enough
prizes to bo around.
Kilted laridies and bonnte lassies danced
and made merry at the twenty-second an
nual gathering and games of the San
Francisco Scottish Thistle Club at Shell
Mound Park yesterday. Fully 10,000 peo
ple attended the outing and watched thÂ«
gayly attired. Scotch people enjoy them
selves. They joined heartily in the pleas
ures of the day and^also had an agree
able time. , Had the dancing pavilion been

A VAIN THOUGHT.
,!,No land, no people have received such bene
fits as our people havÂ» refelved from the.Dec

orportunltles for every one to rise? Its laws
and â¢ its free institutions- teach that no roan
should r<Â»ly upon the deeds of his fathers. He
should try to surpass them. Â¦â¢ He who relies on
dead ancestors Is lost. I can picture the toiler
looking at his little baby boy as It lies rocked
In a cradle by the mother, and saying to It:
â¢â¢Child, you can one day aspire. If you please,
to be President of the-Unlted States." In no
part of the world can you And such conditions
t-xcept here. Such conditions and such chances
are only to be found In free America.' Abra
ham Lincoln., with scanty education, emulated
the best authors In style and rose from a ralf
*plitter-to be the President of the United
States, but his chief claim .to fame Is that- he
was 'the lover of his fellow manâ the liberator
of. four millions of slaves. In what land' will
you. flnd a parallel equal to the life of Presi
dent James A. Garfleld. the canal boy. or to
the life of 'President- Andrew Johnson, the
tailor? Nowhere, I say. except In these United
States. '. - : .-..-..
IVhile American institutions can 'produce
s'ich men and - snch sentiments then we can
proudly claim that our country will endure.
This federal constitution. Is as dear \o forty

capital, as such, can always take care of
Itself. It has money and it ran rurchase bntn
to make out a good case before the world. Ex
perience has shown that unless It is cuTb*d it
will treat its employes as mere machines. It
will not regard their health, their dependent
families, but will force these poor men to work
over hours an<J at a low rate of wages on the
pretense that competition and the law of sup
ply and demand compel such action to pre
serve its property. In this free land no man
can call property absolutely his own. The law
says that be holds It subject to the public wel

It means that as a free man each person Is
entitled to an equttable and fair hearing In

This equal justice means the moral elevation
and happiness of the greatest number. It does
not mean the triumphs of the Intellect, of art,

ANGELS WIN BOTH GAMES.
EDGARDO TAKES
FEATURE EVENT
p jjv^ HE banks of Lake Merritt and the
1 1 boathouses on the Twelfth-street
11 bridge at Oakland were crowded
Â¦*^ j-esterday afternoon with pleasure
seekers to view the annual chanj
pionship rowing regatta of *thc Pacific
Athletic Association.
The Alameda Boat Club won the lion's
share of honors and prizes, taking first
place in the senior and junior barge races
and in the Junior outrigged Ekiff race; The
club lost first place in the Intermediate
barge race by the narrowest margin. Of
the seven events that constitute a full
championship regatta three did not fill,
these being the senior and -junior shell
and the senior outrigged skiff races. The
barge races were the main feature of the
afternoon's snort, the intermediate event
being an unusually close contest.
The first rowing event on the pro
gramme was the four-oared barge race
in the Intermediate class. In this there
were three starters. The Dolphins had
the outside, the Alamedas the center and
the South Ends th<Â« inside. Tlu; Alamedas
started off at <S strokes to the- minute,
keeping this rato up pretty well all over
the course. After turning the stakes the
South Ends and Alamedas came down the
home stretch neck and neck, the Dolphins
being considerably in the rear. The fin-
pic Boat Club and Stockton Athletic As
sociation had entered crews for this race,
but they did not appear at the -starting
line.
Before the senior barge. race was called
a man dressed as a farmer went out in a
rowboat with a person in feminine cos
tume. The latter fell out of the boat and
the man made ludicrous attempts to res
cue her. Another boat, in. . which wero a
policeman and a sculler, put out to the
scone of the confusion and the country
man was taken into custody. Tills little
divertlsement, arranged by S. J. Pem
broke, assisted by D. Carroll and C.
Clough of the Olympic Club, created much
amusement.
A 100-yard swimming race brought out
four competitors, E. Scott Leary winnlnp,
D. Carroll being second and C. Clough
third. A. W. Taylor was distanced.
In the senior barge race the Ariels had
the inside station, the South Ends the
center and the Alamedas the outside.
At the drop of the flag the Alameda crow
shot away, rowing an exceedingly rapid
stroke of 50 or 51 to the minute. After
turning the stakes the Alamedas had a
long lead and were still maintaining a
stroke of 48 to the minute. The Alamedas
won easily, boating the South Ends by
three or four lengths and the Ariels by
nearly twice as great a distance. Time.
,8 minutes. The winning crew was made
up of George Lewis, bow: E. B. Thorn
injj. No. 2: John Lewis. No. 3. />ml Vr*A
ish between the South Ends and the Ala
medas was so close that .most of the
spectators were unable to- tell which had
won. The South Ends were " announced
as winners by a few feet. Time, 8 min
utes 22 seconds. The winning crew was
made up as follows: Charles Jenkins,
bow; M. C. Cashman, No. 2; Matt Harris,
No. 3, and E. Pallas, stroke. The Olym-
P. J. Cadogan. who had been appointed
referee, not appearing, "\V. B. Hinchman,
chairman of the regatta committee of the
Pacific Association, took his place; W.
A. Patch, utarter, was also an absentee.
Robert McArthur of the South Ends per
formed the duties of starter, using a flag
Instead of a pistol. J. A.' Geddes was
marshal and M. J. Calnan assistant mar
shal. . The timers were A. P. Rothkopf,
George James and Major Charles H.
Smith. The judges at the turning stakes
and at the finishing line were chosen from
the following: Z. T. Thorning. W. P.
Nell, J. J. Gleason. Kenneth Melrose.
James Wilson, Len Frank?, Isaac Tuck
ler. F. Baker, A. G. Bell, C. A. Merz,"J.
S. Earls and C. M. Farrcll.
W. Ayers, stroke.
In the junior barge race three crews ap
peared at the starting line, the Olympics
having the inside station, the South Ends
the center and the Alamedas the outside.
The Olympic crew made a poor start,
though Boland, the stroke, seemed quick
er with his hands than any of the.strokes
except Fred Ayers. The Alamedas* turned
the stakes flr?t and won as they liked.
The Olympics took second place.
The junior outrigged skiff race was dis
appointing. The only com'petitors were
E. B. Thornlng of the Alameda Boat Club
and F. J. Sherry of tho Dolphin Boat
Club, who are old antagonists. On the
way to the turning point Sherry was
fouled by a rowboat wandering over tho
course and stopped pulling. Then he
went on. and rounded the stakes, but on
the way homo caught a crab and fell out
of his skiff. On coming ashore he stated
that on catching tho crab he was too tired
to recover himself. : ?-:';*
The tide was fair on both legs of the
course, as it was ebbing on the beat out
to the windward mark and flooding on
the run home. The time made was thus
The sloop Thelma. owned by S. S.
Marshall, W. W. Thompson and G.
Meserole. of the California Yacht Club,
maintained her winning streak yester
day; capturing the annual race for the
Wallace trophy.
A preparatory gun was fired at 11:50
a. in. and the starting gun at 12 noon.
The sloop Thelma crossed the line at
12:01:05 p. m.. and the yawl Iola, sailed
by Robert Vincent, at 12:01:23. There
was a moderate breeze at starting, but
after half an hour had elapsed the wind
freshened considerably and in the chan
nel it blew hard, with a heavy sea run
ning. Â¦* :'H "'*,
Â¦ The yawl Iola would have done better
had she been reefed down, as she re
peatedly put her decks under. Within
three minutes after rounding 1 the Pre
sidio shoal buoy the spinnaker boom of
the sloop Thelma snapped in two. but
in spite of this drawback she finished
Ilrst at 2:24:29, tho Iola . crossing the
finishing line at 2:28:28. * , '
The skipper of the Iola lost some
time by setting. a course toward Sau
salito and overstanding the windward
mark so that he had to ease off sheets'
to round the buoy. The elapsed time of
Thelma was 2:24:29 and" her corrected
time, deducting an allowance of 2:51.
was 2:21:38. The elapsed time of Iola
was 2:2S:2S. Thelma won the race by
6 minutes 50 seconds corrected time.
The course vras from the southerly
pierhead of the Oakland broad-gauge
mole to and around Presidio shoal buoy
(passing Goat Island on the starboard
hand), leaving it on the port hand.
thence back to the starting point (pass
ing Goat Island on the port hand). The
course is reckoned as twelve nautical
miles.

When the came, was over they piled

hands was cut by somebody who tried
to puncture his chest protector with a
knife. Police officers. President Joe Car
man and Mrs. Warner escorted him down

srew in size every, block, followed the
party through the streets to the Donnelly

pursuing the unfortunate umpire to thÂ«
elevator. The crowd informed offloer3 of

away and Flannery and Glendon umpired

Moskiman in Poor Form.
.. i ne morning game at Oakland was
carily won by T'ncle's team by a hcore
iff i to I. Dr. Moskiman, who served up
the shoots for the Cripples, wan in poor
form. Ilr found it exceedingly difficult to
Locate thf> rubber. He walked six men in
in. In the seventh round four hits in a
r^w gave San Francisco" three runs and
the game. The Fcorc:
'San Kranrirr^n â I OaU-ianrl
visibly disappointed. The ppectators went
xway sore at the Fpectaele of a dopey
came, in Â¦which the home team never had
Â» chance. All the way through the cn
"tire rir.e Innings it was one continual
dra*. and good luck alone Kept the score
down as low as it *a?.
â¢The whole San Franriseo team was full
of the real dope and n^t a. single man
played the frame even as well as they
do out on the park green. They could
not hit, while on the bases and in the
field they were something: awful. Only
iii one inning did the pride of the
metropolis Fhow any f-peed and then the
prayers quit before the score was iiny
wh<~re r.ear being 1 a tie.
. The Cripple started in early to hit the
â¢ ball hard -and they never quit for a mo
, m^nt till th^ same was easily theirf.
: T*hoMÂ» who diÂ«i not connect safely with
"Oie ball pot lives <_.n errors and they
rrrtrrd runs. In all. twelve came in and
â¢Vhat seemed to satisfy them for the time
being at least.
The home team *.vs crippled by the
le^s of Tommy Lemby, who was forced to
â¢ k^'p out of th<? camp on account of a bad
Â¦knef. Kelly, the utility man. went behind
the bat and mad'' a porry showing. He
.could not throw the ball ten feet. The
"â¢'ripples profited bv this and stole eight
*ba. c cs on the bewildered backstop.
.Th<- game was practically cinched in the
fim inning, when the Cripples started in
Â»ti<1 sent five of their number over the
rubber on four hits and a brace of errors.
Tr.f-y kÂ»pt adding to thÂ«5 until they had
the whole dozen runs rolled up and the
gamr- wfis theirs in a walk. The score:

t> The reason so many become chronic sufferers from Dyspepsia and Indigestjon is because they
5 depend on drugs, which occasionally give temporary relief between meals. Drugs do not cure; if they
Bi did, what need of their continuous use? .Why they do not cure is because they^fail to reach the source
â¢ of the trouble, viz.: the pneumu-ga'tric nerve,, which alone gives power. to the stomach to digest .food.
5 When the nervous system;is weakfrom overwork or imprudence, the prieumo-ga^tric nerve',- which
Â¦ is an important member of the nervous system; 1 suffers, its share of the' general weakness. â¢â¢ Then' the
S stomach fails to perform its function^, and the "doctors term this conditions" Nervous Dyspepsia.

DENVER, Colo.. July 4.-Thc managers
of tne Denver smelters were taken com
pletely by Kurprjse last night when, at a
meeting; of the emeltermen's union, a
strike was declared taking effect at once,
and they were wholly unprepared for the
walkout which followed. By the drawing
of the fires from under the furnaces at
the Grant and Globe smelters the risk of
a heavy Ioeb to the American SmeltlnK
and Refining Company was Incurred. At
the two cmelters there were eleven fur
naces full of ore and should they "freeze
up" they will have to be blasted out and
rebuilt. It is 8aid by those Informed on
the situation that this strike la the first
move in a general campaign for an eight
hour day-for all unions affiliated with the
Western Federation of Miners and that
the fifflit will be made to a llr.ish. There
arc 2500 men employed in the three smelt
ers of Denver, but the Argo plant, which
is Independent of the trust, will probably
not be involved in the strike. There is
an immense amount of ore to be smelted,
and if the furnaces are not attended to
in a few hours they will grow cold and it
will require an outlay of about $300,000 to
repair the damage that will be done.
A train of twenty-seven ore cars was
derailed at the entrance of the Globe
smelter to-day by a calked switch.
In the disturbance attending the with
drawal of the men Engineer William Ed
wards was struck on the head with a
club and badly injured.
The polico department was called upon
for help by the smelter people and fifty
specials were sworn in and taken to the
Glebe smelter under command of Chief
Armstrong. An equal number of specials
were sent to the Grant smelter. The
smelter people are considering the advis
ability of requesting the Governor to call
out the State troops to guard their plants.
General Manager Guiterman of the
American Smelting and Refining Com
pany said to-day that the two plants
would'tje operated in spite of the strike
and that the men who go to work in place
of the strikers will be protected ' at . all
hazards. â¢ Â¦
The number of strikers at the two
smelters Is 873.
A strike was also inaugurated to-day at
the United 8tates Reduction and Refining
Company's mills at Colorado City and la
bor leaders say that the Cripple Creek
miners will bÂ© called out liveympathy. j? 'i
When asked to-day if the companyjin
tended to continue running Its plants in
the face of the opposition of the Western
Federation of Miners, former Governor

FOUR VICTIMS
The Brady Glacier Is two and, a half
mlks wide and thirty-five miles long. It
is unlike the Muir Glacier in that Its ice
does not break oft' and fall Into the bay.
The glacier was easy of access at higl}
water, when they went in, but coming
back to shore again they found the ship's
boats high and dry and the water nearly
two miles away. Some of the party got
through, but the mud was too deep for
the women. Governor Bratly, Mr. Parker,
a director of the St. Louis Exposition;
Captain Ntcolson and others made pack
horses of themselves and carried the la
dles through mud and water, sometimes
waist deep. .
Thirty passengers of the Spokane land
ed, and for the first time several women
went to the top of the big ice field. Cap
tain Nicholson had anchored the Spokane
two and a half miles from ahqrc, Tho
party went under his direction in the aft
ernoon, expecting to return at 6 o'clock,
but it was 11 o'clock at night before they
reached the steamer, after several excit
ing adventures.
- TACOMA. July 4.â The steamship Spo
kane, which arrived to-day from Alaska
with many tourists, made a special trip
to Brady Glacier, named after Alaska's
Governor, who was on board the Spokane
on this trip. The glacier, which wad dis
covered by Governor Brady twenty-five
years ago. is in Tuylor Bay, about thirty
miles out of the usual course of steam
era. . . â¢

Without seeking to detract in the slight
est degree from the heroic actions of
William Christian, the colored miner who
assisted In savins; many lives after the
explosion, the people here agree that the
pre-eminent hero of the day of the dis
aster was Frank Collins, an expert Eng
lish miner. He was one of the first men
to enter the mine after the explosion and
he carried out eleven men before he was
himself overcome by this firedamp.
CHEYENNE, Wyo.. July 4.â The people
of Cheyenne, Rawlins. L.aram!e and other
cities of Wyoming are preparing to give
liberal cash aid to the families of vic
tims of the Hanna disaster. All who want
to go to. their old homes will be sent free
of expense.
The coal company is supplying the fami
lies of all victims with food. Later, how
ever, financial assistance will be needed
by many women with families of. small
children.
HANNA. Wyo.. July 4.â The fire in the
Union Pacific mine is now confined to a
small space and has been shut off. Many
new experienceu miners are here and it is
believed that by Monday or Tuesday the
bouies of me 230 victims will be reached.
The interior is terribly damaged and work
of clearing up proceeds slowly. It fs pos
sible that the lower workings may be
sealed up and thus become tombs of tho
unfortunate miners.

NATIONAL LEAGUE.
Realizing that there v/as no hope of
covering the whole course Sir Thomas
recalled the tug Cruiser, which was
acting as mark boat, to a point eleven
miles from the starting 1 line. After
roundlnsr the tug the yachts were taken
in tow for Sandy Ilook. The summary:
Klapsed
Start. Finish. Time.
Shamrock III 12:22:40 4::tt:-Ml 4:11:W)
Shamrock 1 12:20:20 8:02:50 4:42:10
Shamrock III won by 31 minutes 10 seconds.
The trial was planned to be over a
thtrty-milo ciwue to tho windward and
back, but t:iebrei-zÂ« held so light that
tho trial -was finished after tho yachts
had sailed eleven miles to windward.
Starting .In the lee of the old boat
Shamrock 'III slipped by her. and soon
after the start the new challenger tried
to pa>s to windward of Shamrock I.
Captain BeviB luffed the old boat and
Captain Wring gave it up and tacked.
Bucking a Ions swell that often shook
the wind out of her sails,. Shamrock III
worked out to windward, and half an
hour later, when not more than three
miles had been sailed, the new boat had
the windward position and the lead. In
two hours' sailing the old boat " was
more than a mile astern and dropping
behind. After, that Shamrock III gained
every mile.
NEW YORK. July 4.â The Shamrock
III to-fiay proved herself a .veritable
ghost in light winds by defeating Sham
rock I moro than thirty-one minutes in
an Eleven mile beat to windward.* It was
a drifting match In a wind averaging
no better than three or four, miles an
hour. If Shamrock I,- as reported, Is ten
mlnu ten faster than ever before, on a
thirty. mHo course, to-day's performance
of tho new cup challenger was- little
short of marvclouB. To-night the men
on Sir Thomas' fleet were of the opinion
that if the Reliance could huvo btfaten
Shamrock III to-day the days of \ nilr
acles are not pant. Changes that vastly
improved the new boat had evidently
been made /Jlnces yesterday. !
Movement of Steamers.
Every steam schooner that could got into
port yesterday and between sunrise and 5
o'clock a dozen coasters had made. port. Only
half a dozen vessels sailed during the day.
Many Steam Schooners Arrive.
Nearly every, vessel in the harbor, whether
alongside the wharf or In the stream, was
gayly decorated yesterday In honor of the
Fourth. Sailing vessels and steamships al'kc
donned their brightest an.l best and from
Mefggs wharf to the Pacific Mail dock buntlhg
In infinite variety of shape and. color flutter*. I
on the holiday breeze. . The Wyoming nnd
Concord, only representatives of the navy In
the harbor, outdid themselves In the decorat
ing- line. The 'Wyoming, with strings of flag*
from el;nal mast to forward rail and to the
extremity of port and starboard boat booms,
appeared a solid triangle of many colors, and
the Concord, with a string of bunting frvm
after rail to bowsprit and stretched from truck
to truck of her two masts, was equally ?\>r
rpoue in her Independence clay display. The
HrltisK ships, as usual, were elaborately dsr?
rated. b--t not more so than Â¦ the steamships
Marlpose, Herodot,. Hongknnff Maru, the
Spreckels tugboats and other vessels of all
sorts anil sizes.
Dressed in bunting In honor of the day,
the Oceanic Steamship Company's liner
Alameda sailed at 11 o'clock yesterday
morning for Honolulu. She carried more
than. fifty cabin passengers and in splfe
of tho fact that she sailed on a holiday

NEW YORK. July 4.-Sweltering heat
somewhat handicapped the "athletes to
day in their efforts to win the all-around
championship title of the Amateur Ath
latic Union of the /United States at Celtic
Park, Long Island City. In all of the
events the competition was keen.
Ellery H. Clark, Boston'Athletic'Asso
ciation, won the title with a total of C318Vi
points. He was'" the champion in 1897.
Adam B. Gurin. Central Young Men's
Christian Association of Buffalo, N. Y.,
the champion of the last two years, was
second with 580SVi points, and F. W. C.
Fester. Harvard, third, with 6348# points.
The performance of the old champion,
Gunn, was most remarkable, consider
ing that he competed in the defense of his
title with a badly Injured foot. His right
foot had been spiked while he waa prac
ticing for the championship.
Up to the last two events, the running
bread lump and tho one-mile run, Clark
was ahead of the world's record for the
point contest, mado by Harry Gill jj of
i Toronto In 1900. At the close Clark was
only a little behind the figures made by
Gill, which were 6360^4 points.
In the 100-yard dash, the flrBt event,
Clark and Foster each won his heat In
10 4-5 seconds. Gunn was away poorly In
his race and finished last, limping badly.
The next event, the shotput, proved
easy for Gun. who won it with forty feet.
Gunn held up well In the high. jump,
Â¦which developed at the close into a pretty
contest between Mahoney, New York Ath
letic Club, and (Jteen of Baltimore, each
clearing 5 feet 6% inche*.
Clark took the mile walk in the easiest
eort of fashion, beating Gunn 'by nine
seconds.
Clark proved his cuperiority in the next
test, the hammer-throw, by throwing the
weight 122 feet \i inch, while Gunn. who
was next best, scored second with 96 feet
2>4 inches.
The nnal point score 'follows:
SMELTERMEN
DECLARE STRIKE
As the twelfth round opened Root re
served his ebbing strength for an attempt
at Gardner's Jaw. f Root was almost lifted
off his feet by a wicked one in the wind.
Another smash .to the etomach made Root
proggy and swlnps on the Jav/ sent him
down. He took the count, got up and was
floored again. He sot up and Gardner
stepped up to him carefully, aimed care
fully and sent his right through Roofs
weak guard to the jaw. Root was on hia
knees when the referee counted ten. Ho
was up a second after and put tip his
guard, but the referee sent him to his
corner. The twelfth round lasted two
minutes and twenty seconds.
The crowd was not large. The expen
sive seat3 showed very bare. Manager
Herman had banked on a J20.000 gate, but
he says he broke only a little to the good.
The men pot into the ring for the main
bout shortly after 4 o'clock, after a sec
tion cf the roof had been taken off. A
hot sun beat down on the resincd can
vas. Referee McBride called the men to
gether and warned them about tho Can
adian law and the necessity of avoiding
hitting in the clinches. The gong then
rang and the men were at It. From the
tap of the bell Gardner showed his bu
pericrlty over Root. He forced the fight
ing, Root leading only when he had to
do so. Gardner opened with a wicked left
to Root's face and followed It up with
swings to the body. Gardner had Root
weary when the round ended. The Lo
well man's most effective blows were the
left to the stomach and Root winced with
pain every time they landed. From the
first round to tho ninth Gardner kept up
the pounding: on Root's stomach. The
men fought very fairly, but the referee
had his hands full separating them in the
cjinches.
AVith the ninth round came the begin
ning of Root's undoing. Gardner rapped
a smashing right to the body and Root
came back with two rights to the jaw,
but George rushed In and sent a long
right swing to Jack's jaw. Root was
dazed. Two smashes in the. etomach
brought his guard down and a clip on the
jaw sent him to the floor. Root took nine
seconds on -his knees and when he got
up he ran into another smash in the
wind and the gong saved him. Root was
worried as Gardner came to him In the
tonth round. Gardner wa3 short in hl3
swings and they wrestled a bit. A left to
the wind lifted Root off his feet and an
uppercut shook him. but he fought back
derperateiy. Gardner rushed Jack around,
fighting wildly in his eagerness. " The
round ended with Root much distressed.
As the gong sounded for the eleventh
round Gardner eent a left to the jav and
Root came back with two swings to the
face. Gardner rushed Root about the
ring, beating a merry tattoo on his ribs.
Root rallied ana sent his right and left to
the head hard and his crowd cheered.
Gardner seemed dazed, but in the clinch
he winked a long-drawn wink to his sec
onds and as soon as the clinch was broken
he Kent three rights to Jack's head. Koot
ran away, but a long swing caught him
back of the car and he sprawled on the
floor, almost rolling out of the ring. He
took the count. Two punches to the jaw
staggered Root again and a couple of up
percuts sent him flat on his back as the
gong founded. His seconds dragged .him
to his corner.
BUFFALO, N. Y., July 4.â George Gard
ner of Lowell. Mass.. defeated Jack Root

tional Athletic Club at Fort Erie this af

Fourth of July turned out to be a sad
day for Clarence Nlto of 1270 v Grayson
street. West Berkeley, for it cost him a
large portion of his left cheek. It seems
the boy was curious to know why a cer
tain blank cartridge in his toy pistol did
not go off. In order to discover the whys
and wherefores of It he looked down the
barrel of the weapon. At an unfortunate
moment, however, he pulled the trigger
and the weapon was discharged. The wad
and powder tore a big hole in his cheek,
just a little below the eye, and so lacer
ated It that it required the services of a
physician and a large amount of thread to
sew it together again. The boy will bear
a scar for the rest of his days..
Willie Vass. aged 14 years, shot off the
Index finger of his left hand with a can
non this morning in front of his home on
Ashby avenue. | The weapon went off pre
maturely while the boy was repairing It.

"Of this country's history you rnen r of
its army have written a glorious page.
Most of you fought that this great nation
might not be sundered. For many of you
the long shadows have already begun to
fall across your mortal path. For those
of us who remain behind more .and more
pathetic becomes the celebration of the
Fourth of July at the Soldiers' Home.
The nation ia eager to manifest to you Its
debt of gratitude, one it can never repay.
For you we twine the wreaths of laurel.
We, the younger generation, salute you.
Thank God. you have not lived in vain.
One comforting thought I would | leave
with you to-day, one thought of exulta

survive and grow strong and expand un
til the dream of Cyrus Field and the
prophecy of Baker have come true."
During the evening about an hour was
given over to a fine display of fireworks.
The grounds were crowded with delighted
spectators. Fireworks of all descriptions,
a forty-foot balloon, dozens of sky rock
et?, innumerablo large night bombs ac
companied by a deafening report were
pent off for the edification of the onlook
ers. At the conclusion of- the exhibition
of the fireworks an electric ?ign. reading
"Good night." appeared and the band
stand suddenly became decorated with
red. white and blue effects. The fireworks
nnd electric display was under tho super
vision of Captain R. D. Clark, chief engi
neer at the home. Inspiring music was
rendered by the homo band during the
afternoon exercises, preceding and during
the pyrotechnical display.
Judge John.F. Davis thrilled the audi
ence,with,as fine an oration as has ever
been delivered at the home. His re
marks throughout were punctuated with
applause, showing the appreciation of the
old boys and their friends. He said in

The Italian quarter was ablaze with
bonfires and a great deal of money was
spent by private individuals for fireworks
of every sort. From balconies were
thrown unlimited quantities of crackers
and whizzing "chasers," while skyrockets
and showers camo from roofs as well as
balconies.
During the display in Washington
Square a band discoursed some very
pleasing selections and national airs,
which delighted the big gathering.
With a determination not to be left out
in the cold, and bearing in mind that
there are possibly more children In that
quarter of the city than In any. other
part, a number of merchants contributed
a purse with which to gave a patriotic
display in Washington Park.
Being the result of private contribu
tions. It was not to be expected that the
fireworks displays this year would equal
those pyrotechnical 'exhibitions which
have gone before and for which an ap
propriation had been made.
Nevertheless, there were enough of the
rockets and Roman candles and plnwheels
to please the adult as well as the Infant,
and one display, the head' of President
Roosevelt, in sparkling stars of fire and
in the national colors, was sufficient to
elicit the most enthusiastic applause and
loud and long continued cheers. The dis
play did credit to those who arranged
the exhibition.
The people of the North End of tha
city were disappointed this year because
of their failure to obtain an appropriation
for a fireworks display in that part of
the town.
It was generally remarked that in fu
ture It would benefit the public If the
set pieces should be placed on high
ground. \
The fact that the set pieces were placed
on low ground interfered with their be
ing properly seen by many people. Men
lifted women bodily in order that they
m'ight see over the heads of those in
front, and children were perched upon the
shoulders of their fathers, while the less
fortunate had to be contented with the
rockets and pretty red, white and blue
balls, which were sent scattering high up
In the. air in hundreds.
The wind blew half a gale over the park
during the display, but the great crowd
stood at its post, never budging tintil the
last set piece was shown with the words.
"Good Night," emblazoned in variegated
colors.
There were set pieces In the square and
plenty of rockets and cascades bf fire and
a band accompanying the display with
musical selections.
Every window was occupied and the
small boy and the little girl attended In
goodly numbers with their adult escorts.

LESSONS OP THE DAY.
In conclusion, let us remember that this an
niversary of the Declaration of Independence Is
not alone a love feast of the Ajnertcan people
to enable them to recount the past glories of
their country, its present greatness and Its
mighty future. It Is more.
This day Is a means of keeping up a nation
â an Indestructible, union of indestructible
States. It matters not how the day may b*
celebrated. If It causes some degree of en
thusiasm It has accomplished its purpose. If
It recalls to the American the trials and serv
ices of the Revolutionary Father* and the rea
son of their sufferings It will not bave been
celebrated in vain.
If it contributes. In a small way to the af
fection of our people for & united America It
will have accomplished its work. The Ameri
can who can remain unmoved on the Fourth
of July is unworthy of his birthright. "That
n.an " says Dr. Johnson, "Is little to be en
vied whose patriotism does not gain force upon
the plains of Marathon, or whose piety does
not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona."
So, I srÂ»\ tlie American, native or natural
ired. Is little to be envied who does not respond
with beating heart and glancing eye and ar
dent desire to the memories of :.-ls day and he
rau't Indeed be dtad to honor, detd to virtue
and dead to all those subtle qualities which
distinguished the freeman from the down
trodden stave.
As for us. let us pray that during our lives
we shall never forfret those who guaranteed
life, liberty and happiness to us and on this
day, when we see the Stars anJ Stripes float
ing majestically from the housetops, let us
repeat the words of Webster. . "'Liberty and
fnlon. Now and Forever, One and Insepara
ble."
At the close of the address the
speaker was again given hearty applause
and congratulated by those upon the
platform.
Miss Annie Rooney then rendered a
pretty ballad, and Miss Bertha Clark re
cited "The Flower of Liberty," from the
pen of Oliver Wendell Holmes. Both the
ladies mentioned were cheered.
To the music of the orchestra the en
tire audience joined in singing "Amer
ica." all present rising In their places
wlien the first 'strains of the glorious
song were sounded by the musicians.
PRONOUNCES BENEDICTION.
The exercises closed with the bene
diction, pronounced by Rev. Father
J. P. ilcQuaide. who spoke as follows:
Omnipotent. Kternal God. by whose power
all the tribes of men and the nations of the
earth are moved, governed and directed accord-
Ing to infinite wisdom, we, thy people, bowed
down before thee to-day raise our hearts to
the* to thank thee for the Innumerable favors
bestowed on us in mercy and love from the
dawning of our national liberty to this hour.
From the tyranny of the oppressor thou hast.
O Lord, delivered us. and raised us up Into
thee, a people who are grateful to thee. who
acknowledge thee. who confide in the* and call
upon thee In all our woes.
When battles raged about us on land and
sea thou didst not. O Father, disdain our hum
ble cry for help and the tide of war was
turned back; and the billows of the angry sea
heard thy voice and lulled themselves to rest.
In the throes and agony of civil strife and In
our struggles for the rights of man thou hast
most sweetly smiled upon us and permitted us
ta stand a nation, according to the production
of thy foreknowledge.
Receive, then. O Faithful God. the humble
thanks of thy children here to-day and bind
us all with go!den chains about thy feet. Let
brotherly concord reign and fill our hearts.
Father cf Light, from whom all power In
heaven and earth descends, direct our magis
trates in the way of peace and fill their hearts
with the spirit of thy wisdom, love and fear.
On account of our sins enter not. O Lord with
us into Judgment and deal not with us In thy
anger. 'Lead, kln.lly light, lead thou us on"
aÂ« of old thou didst lead thy people out of
boTHlage.
May *e walk In the light of thy counten

thee. Send forth then thy holy spirit, O God.
over the face of the earth and all th* works of
thy hands â the earth, the sea. the sky and air
enkindled at thy touch shall utter forth thy
praise, and may the praise, too. of us. thy peo

CALIFORNIA'S GREATNESS.
But l<-t Vf remember that California Is great
elmpty because she Is a member of the glorious
unk n of t-tate,. To call ourselves CWIIornliM
jÂ« Juet To call ourselves Americans Is better.
Vrlted with the other great States of the
Vnion *e are invinclWe. By ourÂ»elvee we are
nothing. We are proud cf our State, but we
are -still rmu'ler of the I'nlon. Together we
â¢can meÂ»t any foreign foe, aeparated we would
be ft prey for an auds<-ious adventurer. Let us
â¢rio our duty ty prpserviiig her preat rivers her
p"*r.t trÂ«-eÂ«. her water ehtds. and the crumbling
memorial* cf the miMior.ary period, and thus
kÂ«-Â»f her a Etate to be loved and to be ad
in1 red.
The citiiens cf Fan Francisco have alrÂ»acy
rr.aae their declaration of Independence by the
Hdoptlon of the charter. Lei them continue to
VÂ»<Mt themselves tree from corrupt Influence In
political affairs. It Is a natter of surprise to
ill* Duropeass that In the United States, where
tbe popular will is supreme, cltie* are so badly
a-overned. They ask how It Js that we elect
good Governors and good Majors, but cannot
*>ucÂ«-e*d In elc-ting good legislative councils.
Tlie recer.t <ilÂ«< 1'isures In St. Louis. Mo., give
point to this judgment. The answer, however.
Is that such corruption is not the fault of the
American eystpm. but the fault of the people
<vho for t!iÂ» time belr.g are r.ot aroused to the
t-erise cf danger. The real cause shown by
Folk the brave District Attorney of St. Loul*.
is that public utilities are In the hands of
<-ap;talicts. and. secondly, that the laws are not
properly administered through the mantrfcla
i:on of capitalists, and thirdly, the boss who Is
the Intermediary is regularly paid l>y capital
ists, to corrupt officials.
But the change Â¦will come. "Tou may fool
nil the pÂ«ople part cf the time, you may fool
*'-roe of the people all tbe time, but you can
r-rt fool all the people all the time." How true
,nrÂ» the words cf Lincoln. Vet, u can be trutn
?u!!y taJd that If the people as tiuch are left
!rÂ«> to %-ote as thÂ«-y pleased, without lnterfer
Â»-n<-e of corrmrt capitalists, they would always
vote for that which U ;ust and right. The
-.*<1 herring Is always drawn across the right
prTA by an agent of associated villainies who
penÂ»rally passes as a friend Â«t tHe i>eople until
ofter clecticn. What. then. Is the remedy?
SUGGESTS A BEMEDTT.
Tr.e remedy. :ny friend*. lÂ» a new declara
t'nn of Independence for ourselves. We rbould.
Dike our father*, mutually pledge our Jives, our
snd our eacred honor to acquire al!
public utilities in the name of the people. lyet
\i* f.rn our own water works, let us own our
â¢oÂ»-o gee and electric works, let us own our
MreÂ»-t railroad', our telephone and telegraph
Â»!r*Â» and lart but not least, let uÂ« control
Â«ur oV/n Â«eÂ«port. Then and not till then will
*e be free from the pernlciou* rule of monopo
lies whene system Is to browbeat, and. where
.Lrowbeatlng Is of no avail, tÂ» bribe. This Is
t!io day of a!! others when we ehould make a
.*o>nin vow to change this condition of af
fair*.
Thts le the <5Â«y for uÂ» to re--! against thin
uk:;' : â¢ â¢ir.n of power. It is naJd by Interested
â¢ parties that *re cannot make a auccesa of
Tt, <Â¦â¢".â¢ public utilities and that politicians will
â¢â¢ontrol them. I answer that many communi
ties in the Old World and In the United States
liave already succeeded, with the aid of civil
service. I do not tee why we should not do
n unless Â»" concede that the rights of man
'." life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness has
made us Inferior in ability and In executive
; Â¦'Â». -r to other men. This 1Â« tbe dilemma of
jhe or.pc.nent* cf popular control. ' .
I? t\icy admit t!yst the i>eople of a commu
nity like Pan Francisco are as capable as
thoMS of other municipalities where public
utllltie* are managed with suewss they eon
<*de their <-ase. If on tbe other hand, they
deny that the people are unfit to manage their
own affair*, then they virtually admit. that our
ryrttra of government Is a failure, that popu
lar governmert In s tnlrtake and that we
ehould be left Â»t t!<e mercy of a few rich men
ntrollln* trurts end, monopolies. They would
Li;;i'y act Â«* our guardians. - .tit. my friends.
It indeed the inmost deelre cf the enemy of
jtopular control. 1/ut he does not put the point
in that way. He prefers to argue otherwise.

The trouble originated in the refusal of
young Starks to submit to arrest. He
was charged with having offended the
daughter of Benjamin Ogles, a wealthy
farmer, who filed complaint against him.
When Sheriff Taff approached Starks
warned htm away, saying there would be
trouble if he attempted to take him into
custody. Robert Starks came up at the
moment and after learning that his son
was about to be arrested, hurried home,
where he procured a revolver. He re
turned to the Crawford County Bank
building, where the Sheriff and his son
were standing.
"Here, take this." said the elder Starks
to his son. "and If Taff don't leave you
alone you know how to protect yourself."
The Sheriff triÂ«Â»d to argue with the el
der Starks. but to no puB^ose. He then
took Her^chel by the arm and as he did
so the prisoner began firing. One of the
bullets struck Taff In the stomach and
he sank unconscious to the ground. Ivca,
who was attracted by the shots, ran up the
street with revolver in hand and opened
fire as he aaw young Starks brandishing
his weapon. Herschel Starks fell at the
first shot and his father then wrested hia
pistol from him and began firing on the
deputy Sheriff. The latter was shot
twice, the first bullet taking effect in his
mouth, the other lodging in the right leg.
City Marshal Weeds came to the rescue
of the officers at this point. A few mo
ments later the elder Starks fell dead
with a bullet through his heart. .
It is believed that Deputy Sheriff Ives
Is the only one of the four shot who has
any chance to recover. The shooting oc
curred on one of the principal business
streets and threw the little town into a
furor of excitement.
STEEL.V1L.LE. Mo., July 4.â One dead
and three perhaps fatally, injured is the
result of a duel with revolvers which took
place here this afternoon between Sheriff
W. R. Taff of Crawford County, hisyiep
uty, Perry Ives; Deputy Marshal John
Woods, and Robert Starks, a farmer, and
his son. Herschel. aged 23 years. Robert
Starks was shot through the heart, death
resulting instantly. W. R. Taff, the Sher
iff, was shot through the stomach and
will die: Heischel Starks was fatally shot
and PÂ«rry Ives, deputy Sheriff, was shot
In the mouth and leg." His condition is
dangerous.

DETROIT, Micb., July 4,-With the ob
servance of regular Sabbath morning ser
vices, the fourteenth annual meeting of
the ' Central Conference American
Rabbis came to an end to-aay. The con
ference sermon was preached by ' Rabbi
Samuel Himchberg of Boston, on the ap
propriate subject for the Fourth of Julyâ
â¢â¢Judaism; Americanism, Cosmopolitan
ism." Rabbi Hirschberg said:
"The Jew, as far as nationality goes,
shares a common identity and in equal
degree with . all his fellow residents of
this or any other land. His religion has
naught to ho wrtfi his citizenship, unless
it be to make "that citizenship the better,
the truer and more devoted. Judaism, in
the largest universal sense, truly, right
fully spells cosmopolitanism. If 1b only
the â¢ unconscionable and unconvlncible
anti-Semitism that cannot and will not
see it. There is no people to-day so read
ily assimilative of the national character
istics, truly cosmopolitan, as -the Jews."

MANY USES MADE.
OF OLD TIN CANS
Worked Over Into Weights for Elt
vators, Window Sashes
and Such. ' ' '
Â¦ I was much surprised and greatly In
terested a few days since when shown
through a certain establishment near Ne'er
York city to find that the "raw material"
used consisted chiefly of cmpty'frult and
vegetable cans 'rescued by the cart load
from the dumps of the city. I had sup
posed, up to that time, that the only pur
poses for which such material was suited
was food for goats or to be attached to
the tails of unfortunate canines. The
principal products of this establishment,
which Is a foundry, are window-sash
weights, elevator weights and ballast for
boats. The weight castings are very hard,
and when struck with a hammer ring Ilka
steel. About the only tool which can bo
Â¦used for removing sprues and flns Is thÂ«
hammer, as a cold chisel or flla will not
stand up to the work. The fracture of the
round sash weights Is smooth, and shows
crystals radiating from the center llkÂ»
spokes of a wheel.
After delivery at the foundry the cans
are first piled into a large iron grating lo
cated under a sheet-iron hood which ter
minates in a smokestack. They are
sprinkled liberally with crude ell. which
is set on fire. This process consumes the
labels, loosens the dirt and melts the
solder, which falls through the grating, la
collected, washed and melted, cast Into
Ingots and sold to be used again. Some of
the cans, which have simply l.;rp<"d and
soldered joints, melt apart completely.
These arc sorted out and the sheets' form
ing the sliell are straightened and bound
into bundles to be sold to trunk makers,
who utilize them for protecting the cor
ners of Saratoga trunks. Thev are also
bought by button manufacturers, who
stamp from them the disks used In cloth
covered buttons. -The remainder of the
cans, being machine made. Â«!o net come
apart. These are loaded Into large carts,
taken to the charging floor on an eleva
tor and dumped into the cupola. The
cupola is fed with coke and cans in alter
nation. .....
There Is occasionally an old wash boiler
or a bundle ot tin roonns: used, but cans
/orm the bulk of the material. The. cans
are so light that some, of .them are car
ried out at the top of the stack by the
force of the blast, and a large screen has
been arranged to prevent the pieces from
falling on the roof. If among these read
ers of the American Machinist to whom
these facts are. new there are any who
have occasion to use the elevators In the
skyscrapers of New York I can imagine
such . wondering how many en;pty cans
it took to make the, weights which balanc*
the car In which they rlde.-Araerican

TREMBLING MOUNT â Subscriber.
City. "Trembling Mount" is the name
given tcr a slngular^plle of rockw-in the
valley <tf Rouge River, almost directly
north oj Montreal, Canada.. It la also
known as the "Devil's Mountain." It' is
the highest point on the Laurentlan range
of mountains- It is said that at certain
seasons the. mountain trembles and that
peculiar, noises issue from it. There is
an Indian tradition that the thunder god
used to "sit on this' peak for three days
In the'iprlng, seven In 'the 'summer, 'five
in the iÂ»ll and two in winter, and that
during 1he time he was present,^ great
chasms would open In the sides, of. the'
mountain .from, which .i streams 'of fire
would finw during the mid-summer nights'
for hours at. a t|me. It is probable that
thU tradition., is based on ,the 'fact that
In the line ago there was volcanic action
at that aocallty. The volcano beneath the
rocks Is no longer, actjve.. and- geologists

PEOPLE HAVE QUEEK
DWELLIJIO PLACES
, Yesterday there wes another Ions line
or callers at the Pa'.aot for Abbott. The
Inquiries were ra*t with the response that
hÂ« was no longer a guest of th* hotel,
and surh provfd to be the case, for in the
afternoon the management, for reasons
*vhich It does not deem itself obligated to
explain, put an extra lock on. the London
syndicate agent's rooms and closed his
accounts on the books.
â¢ What has been Abbott's source of reve
nue durir.c- his stay here no one seems
able to explain, but it IÂ« generally bc
li*ved by those who became acquainted
u!th him that the money which' he had
<3?j>C6lt<?d in the f'a!ace Role] nafe was
the extent cf his finances and when that

CLOSED AGAINST HIM.
In the evening it developed that Abbott
had . not been occupying his rooms for
several days, b-Jt had been eecreted in a
notorious house on Ellis street, to which
a part of his baggage had beca conveyed
a few r.Ishts before.
On Friday Abbott was the most sought
for man around the Palace. Men were
waiting for him in nearly every nook of
the bis court, but, apparently, he scented
danger, for he slipped into the hotel and
up to his room by way of the front ele
vator without encountering those who
were ca the lookout for him. On leaving
the hotel later, however, he was confront
ed by a chauffeur who in no pleasing
jnanner reminded him of an obligation
which Abbott had overlooked.
'no lunds." Hardly had this message ar
rived before another and similar one was
received frcm the Orient Bank of New
York City. The "proprietor of a roadsido
resort having cashed one of Abbott's
checks and hearing that they had been
dishonored by the Eastern financial con
cern, made telegraphic inquiries of his
ow-n and fully confirmed his suspicions.
Quickly securing the services of an officer
the ar.gry boniface overhauled Abbott and
rr.Â£<1e him redeem the worthless piece of
paper. Then others who had cashed Ab
bott's freely circulated pape: began to
hunt him vp. but In the majority of cases
he pur.gled vp the cash and temporarily
stemmed the tide of trouble that was com
ir.g his way.
Â¦presented to him for consideration he
would c;ve the papers b. casual scrutiny
acd then turn thtm over to "his expert,'"
Â¦who accompanied him to the city.
WAHKIUG FEOH THE NOBTH.
Abbott was at the height of his pace
;hree days ago. when a warning note
came from the nortr. to the effect that his
checks, cashed there several weeks ago,
bad been returned from the Eastern bank
upon which they had been drawn marked
For a time Abbott kept a reserve fund
la th* Mfe cf the Palace Hotel, a fact
which he was disposed to emphasize
whenever the opportunity afforded Itself.
He always rode when he visited the local
French restaurants at night and showed
e. strong penchant for the more expensive
automobile when a conveyance was need
ed to cr:3ble him to make the round3 of
various resorts which he iratronized.

cf fciÂ« acartments aad several creditors
"had overhauled him and forced him to
diegorge ecae of the money he la accused
cf having eecured from them on bad

Abbott arrived in the city about five
Â«-eekc ago and has since cut a wide swath
elong the cocktail route, spending meney
lavishly and et the same time incurring
debts In a reckless manner that was
bound to sooner cr later rour.d him up la
a lot cf trouble. He reeTistered from Lon
don., but informed his newly made ac
cuaintaaees th*t bis home was in New
Tork. where he described his offices as
among the most luxurious cf the great
metropolis. He explained his presence in
the city by stating that he had come di
rectly frcm the East In Quest of mining
properties. Price would cut no figure, he
declared. If the property would stand a
thorough examination, for his company

ery day cf the week. At night he showed
conspicuously about the court of the Pal
ace in a well-fitting "evening dress coat
end immaculate shirt front, and carried

With the knowledge that they possessed
of the fortune Allman had Inherited from
his father, It was natural that the busi

frequently cash the youns saaaV checks
when hla needs demanded.
Until recently Allmcr.'s paper was re

dayo as-o. however, he Importuned a num
ber of acquaintances, among them the
proprietor of the L!ck House, a neighbor

cash his checks aa usual, for various
amounts. From that day hla absence
from the street has been noted and goner
ally commented upon and has been fol
lowed by the Information, given out by
those who accommodated him with
money, that his checks were worthless.
The Xevada Bank, upon which they were
drawn, repudiated them with the custom
ary stamp, "No funds."
That Allman Is not far away and fully
appreciates the seriousness cf h!s offenie
Is evidenced by a note lately addreesed to
one of his victims, in which he appeals to
the latter to extend to him a little len
ier.cy and assures the holder of the chec!c
that It will be redeemed in time. Friends
of Allman have also Interested themsslves

The absence lately of George D. Allman
from his customary haunts about ths Lick

street has given rise to ugly rumors con
cerning his methods of financiering and tp
intimations cf prosecution In the event of
his failure to reimburse a number of
business men whom, it is alleged, he has
victimized with worthless checks. .
Allman Is the son of a pioneer, stage

years ago. he left his wealth, including
his stage lines, running out of Cazadero,

Shafnv.ald, Burkbee & Co. have also
made other good sales, notwithstanding
a he summer holiday season, which is
usually the dullest period of the year.
Among- their sales, just reported, are the
following:
The figur** fcr th<? month of June as segre
gated from thÂ» figures for the Fix months were
HO f"**|*f*1. amounting to |1.!K)4,7P2. v. h0Â»
r.ix rcleascfi were recorded, amounting to

years 1*76 and 1S33. ><Â»ars of dept^tsion. when
the release* amounted to only .v> or W) per cent
at the mortgages. Even tlirn ownership of real
**tate had decided advantages, as ability to
borrow on Jt paved many from financial rufn.
The increase In mortgages on city real estate
tollows so closely the increase in the amount
of sales that it is not surprising that the mort
gages recorded on city real estate for the first
half of the year exceed by $3.57<3,M<> the mort
?aRT?fi for the last half of 1902. There were
1"S3O mortgages and deeds of trust recorded in
;h_e fix months endinjr June 30, 1903, amounting
to' *l<j,37%.rÂ»Cy, and 22C5 releases were . given
Â»or a- total of (I2.CM.en. There was, there
:otp, nearly CXOQ&flOB more loaned than was
released. These figures show that this half
>ear hzs witnessed the largest totals of money
loaned on r^al estate in the same period in the
hirtcrr of the city. Repayments of old loans
continue to amount to about 75 per cent of the
mortgage?. Tlie increase of mortgage indebt
r-duess has therefore kept pai-e with the tn
â¢ T'ate In Ealo* of real estate. Substantially
liiis relatioa brtwet-n the amount of mortgage
indelitedn*** and thÂ» amount of repayments of
*!d mortgages has hÂ«>en maintain^ for many
and lias conic to be considered a reliable
indication that the loaning of money on i-an
Trancisco real 'Â¦state is bÂ»inff done on con
wrvative *nd tafÂ«> lines. The only notable dr
!<artur*-s from thiÂ« condition occurred in the
LOANS AND RELEASES
Concerning loans and releases during:
the first half cf the year, the Real Estate
Circular says:
Â£a2e* in outside land and homesteads have
increased materially and were MS in number,
amounting to SI, 448.643. Improvements, both
of aclusi building erected and of street work
done, have made this possible. Larg* sums of
# monry have been thuÂ« expended ln the Rich
mord and south of the park districts.
The purchaa* of real estate fcr tn-restment
during the present period of prosperity, vrhieh
hÂ«Â« been *pr*reat in reÂ«J estate transaction*
!Â»r tsearly two yeÂ»rs. has been oonnnea *lm<>Â»t
â¢â¢uUrely to business properUes. SÂ«JeÂ« In tnÂ«
50 \-Â«ra Â»ectjoa were 355 ln number. Â«n<l
to J7,4W,Â«2 for tte past six months;
This 1* CO per cent cf the sales for the whole
<-ity for the same period. The total sale* in
the 100 vara district for the past sir months
were 2x6 in noaiber. and amounted to |5,4bi.-
The total number of sales mad* la the "West
Â«-rn Addition the nret half of the year 1902
Â»aÂ« *7 476.C13. Even this hiBh total hae been
'Â¦scoeded by over a half mlUioa dollars for the
firÂ«Â«t half of lÂ»03. The cumber of sales were
uu for a total of $8,202,522. The business
l.lotis of the Western Addition aloag Larkln
and Polk streets and Van ICees avenue have
increased in value and Importance durinr this
half year. In the best residence district* of
the Western Addition prices are firm and con
tinue to advance. Here It is simply a case of
vrupp!y and demand; the demand is rood, the
5t;pj-.ly comparatively light. Purchasers who
are acenstomed to refuslr-Â«; property east of
â¢ Vntral avenue because the price was $250 to
S..30 per front foot now find that even ln the
Presidio Heights Duirict these prices prevail
for the best properties orÂ« the north side of the
ttrect and with unobstructed views.
The Â«-Â«].!> in the Mission district were S6S ln
number and amounted to S2.546.O45 for the
half year Just closed, a uniform incrÂ»asÂ« over
the totals lor any half year ln the last two

Exiles Appeal to the Czar.
LONDON, July 3.â Grand Duke Michael
of Russia and his morganatic wife.
Countess* Torby, have made a final appeal
to the Czar for forgiveness and permis
sion to return from exile. They have
taken Kelle Hall, in Staffordshire, for a
residence. The Countess Is one . of the
most beautiful women In Europe and a
granddaughter of the celebrated Russian
poet Pushkin. They have two children.
The Countess does not appear at any
court function because the Czar refuse.*
to recognize the marriage, but She Is well
received in society. The last appeal by
the exiled Grand Duke has again caused
gossip concerning the Czarowitz, Grand
Duke Michael, who is brother of Czar
Nicholas and heir to the throne If no male
children are born to the Czarina. The
Czarowitz Is still seeking a bride among
the royal houses of Europe. A match
with Princess Victoria, daughter of King
Edward, once seemed probable, but the
near relationship of the two has been a
barrier.
Her voice is a fine soprano of dramatic
tone and magnificent quality. Her
friends are predicting for her a grand fu
ture on the opera stage.
She learns a part well and has a good
repertoire, but her principal roles are
Marguerite in "Faust," Juliette in
"Romeo and Juliette," Elsa in "Lohen
grin." Elizabeth in "Tannhauser" and
Alda. .
Mrs. Becker Is a woman of most pleas-
Ing appearance, being tall and well built,
with graceful and refined bearing. She
has a splendid head of hair, dark blue
eyes, fine nose and very pretty mouth
and chin,â Indeed a perfect combination
of features in a very mobile face.
Mrs. Becker Is a daughter of Dr. and
Mrs. C. V. J. Ludwig of St. Louis, Mis
souri. As a child, she showed much talent
and aptitude for music, and later devel
oped a taste for the stage. After much
opposition on the part of her parents she

very tenderly. "Of course, there are nice

as elsewhere. There are all. kinds. There

only you hear more about the submerged'

But I did not go on the stage untllafter
I was married. I wanted to be a painter,
my, father was an artist. No, a course in
a Methodist university, where I was edu
cated, is hardly suggestive training for
an actress!"- ; . . *; >
""You are not of an acting family, I un
derstand, Miss Bingham?" :
"Not at all," x and the actress rippled
outright. '"My dear old grandmothers,
both of them. . have never been in a
theater in their lives. My mother' has
been there only less seldom. She had many
wrong ideas about the stageâ like all peo
ple who know little about it. and it hurt

; "She is proud?â Â¦â" *
"Thank you,", said this other manager.
"He's a dear, fine fellow, and one of the
cleverest stage managers we have."
"What did v you do - with Frohman
mostly?"
"Everything," " Miss . Bingham replied,
smiling -a gain. "I was what he called his
producing leading , woman. I would ap
pear in three, four, . five plays during
the season, creating all "my part3. Peo

curious situation* And one must have
new plays. The revivals will not pay.
Where a play formerly ran for five or six
years it will hold now only one or two
seasons. That. is one of the reasons for
the Shakespearean productions that are
now so happily plentiful. But there Is so
much money involved, in s this matter.
With what you spend on a production,
such as one cares to have, that you peo
ple can damn into disuse by a few strokes
of your pen, you could- get a nice piece
of real estate fn the heart of New York.
That is how I put It to myself when I'm
reckoning up. Still, I am going to put on
the first effort of a new playwright next
season, 'The Canterbury Pilgrims,' by a
son of SteelÂ© Mackaye. I hope It will
go. No, People should take this amuse
ment question more seriously."
But 'here Mr. Bingham, hungry, ap
peared to remind his wife that she haa
had no luncheon, courteously inviting us
to join them. Our refusal brought out a
humorous: "Oh, well, you newspaper hi
dalgos always scent a bribe in a cup of
tea! We'll be friends after the story ap
pears."
And so we said our good-byes.
"Yes,J'm happy in it," acknowledged
their manager. "I am rather proud of
myself in securing Mr. Abingdon, for in
stance. He is a London favorite, and I
thought could hardly be persuaded to
come over here. Â» â¢ â¢ And how he does
revel in your scenery! He has enjoyed
every minute of the tour, I think. We all
think it'* wonderful enough."
We talked mountains and things awhile
and then I asked: "You are to give us
other plays besides 'The Climbers'?"
"Yes. another Fitch comedy, adapted
from the French. 'The Frisky Mrs. John
son.' and 'A Modern Magdalen.' adapted
from an old Swedish play by Haddon
Chambers," the actress replied. "The
Chambers play is on something of the
Ibsen order, wonderful body, I think."
"Have you played any Ibsen?"
"No, not yet," and the actress put a
pensive finger to her pale cheeks. Then
came to me the impression of her extra
ordinary renosefulness. Beyond resting
her cheek for a moment on her hand, and
leaning slightly forward at times. Miss
Bingham had preserved her graceful still
ness, since we began to. talk. Her voice,
low, sweet, almost a caress, added elo
quently to the impression. Then she went
on: "Tbe financial end of Ibsen is so un
certain, and one must have money to do
things"â there is. by the way, a strong
practical strain In Miss / Bingham's
make-up.
"It Is only good for a matineeâfinan

"But I must tell you an odd Ibsen hap-
"Five hundred nights." Miss Bingham
said, gently proud. "It was my first

original . company has turned out six

"Who are " <
"Oh, Robert Edeson, Annie Irish. Minnie
Dupree. Madge Carr Cook andâ who are
the others?" she puzzled. Later I found
they were Arthur Byron and Clara Blood
good, a little band of which any man
agerial instinct might reasonably, be
proud.
"Yotu- company now is excellent," I
testify*
"It is a great responsibility," she said
gently. "One feels a little like the old
woman in the shoeâ so many children she
didn't know whatMo do, you know. I
think a woman takes It, too, less easily
than a man. She sees littlei thingsâ just
as you <1Â» when you go about your- horned.
"It must be- tremendously hard work?"
I say, looking at the pale. . thoughtful
face before me. the eyes a little tired, the
mouth a. little sad.
"Yes, then came my\five years with Mr.
Frohman," she recalled, "and then,.- then
came my own managerial work. Three
years ago I began on my own responsi

"Do you kriow that It was with Mr.

asked. "We did 'The Danltes,' 'The Wife'
and a number of other things. How long

pale sunlight, broke out.. "When we were

beyond Cripple Creek. We didn't know
if our play would suit, or anything. But
we went. Oh! and the glorious ride
there. I never expect to see anything
more beautiful. Mother Nature has sim
ply surpassed herself. â¢ â¢ â¢ We played
'The Climbers,' and would you believe It,
we never had a brighter audience. But
that's not it. After our play was over
what do you j think we found? Mary
Shaw's 'paper.' She had played 'Ghosts'
there two weeks before to crowded
houses!" ,- ~
"That's nothing," I boast. "We have
had 'The" Lady Inger of Ostrat' here."
"No really," Miss Bingham smiled. "We
have not had that pleasure yeL in New
York." /
"Nance O'Neil produced it," I supply.
"Ah? She is. a variously courageous
person, I hear " *
"A talented one."
"You people. , partly," she said, bowing
# to me. "You critics. You are too hard on
'the young playwright. If the young writ
ers are :.not encouraged where are the
dramatists of to-morrow to come from?

They've got to eat to live. Food is the
public encouragement of talent. Look at
this play of Richard Harding Davis, 'The
Taming of 'Helen,' "that Henry Miller
brought out this year. Every one but the
critics seems to have liked it, but they
pulled it to pieces unmercifully." They may
be right. But it was Davis' first effort.
Can he go on now?. Will he have- the
heart foe it? And the scarcity of writers
makes those who are known almost pro
hibiilvo in tbejr prices* All round i$ is a
town just now. He'll probably come back
with something wonderful soon."
Here Mr. Blngham, brown-haired, brown
eyed, brown-faced, brown-suited and even
brown-tied, came in beaming: "Oh,
mamma, I've - got you the prettiest
kimono you ever saw!- 1 â oh, how do you
do?" Then, with the information that he
would await his lady in 'the grill. Miss
Bingham's husband discreetly vanished.
"Didn't I tell, you so?" she laughed.
"He has furnished our house almost com
pletely with antiques. â¢ ? â¢ You know
that It was under my husband's manage
ment I first went on the stage?"
"Yes. In a theater on the Bowery

a moment's notice, taking the part of the
leading lady, who hadV fallen ill. as Lu
cille in 'Passion's Slave'â doesn't the story

in to make fun, stayed to praise. He
headed his story next day 'A Diamond

"Where did you get all that?" she
laughed.
"Your press agent," I replied. "But we

"And it to also very difficult to get

he read me the first act. I said 'That

him my check."
'"How do you account for its refusal by

"Oh." she said, thoughtfully, "it was

'IWasn't 'The Climbers' frequently re

"Oh, they almost all Bay that you do

ingly. "It is not that But a New York

"So you were afraid?"
"Well, it is a long wayâ do you realize
how far and how expensive?â to bring a
large organization of players to a possible
failure." the actress said seriously, and I
realized that before me was the woman
manager, with the hap of two score peo
ple upon her feminine shoulders. "But
they did not let us stay long in doubt last
night as to how they liked us," she con
cluded, happily.
"I am a very happy woman." Miss
Bicgham returned, seating herself In a
graceful, slightly conscious pose. She
wore a glove-fitting black silk gown,
quiet smartness itself, with its latticed
spaces, embroidery and yellowed lace
yoke. The hat was of white straw, with
a demure wreath of roses, for those who
care to know, and her chief Jewelry was
a. wedding ring. "I feel," she went on.
solemnly happy, "that I could take San
Francisco right into my arms for its
kindness. You know they tell such
awful stories of you peopleâ that you are
cold, peculiar, most critical and so on. I

Like ail fanatics â and your fanatic and
genius are the only people who do

earnest. Everything matters. I relt while
with her that the Bingham production
of "The Climbers" m San Francisco, Just
ftn the map of the Americas, on a juvenile
planet in the midst of a thousand thou
sand solar systems, was the one thing of
import in the whole universe. I humbly
respect Miss Bingham for making me
feel thus. I greatly respect the result of
this her attitude toward -her art. I re
spect and wholly envy its tremendous
â¢Optimism.

The air was piquant with the contrast.
JHrs. Campbell had forgotten the Inter

â¢ see the sudden shimmer of tears in the
Einile, feel the silent spilling of blood upon
..the pitiless altars of perfectionâ at the
feet of a god who is dumb. â¢ â¢ â¢ Every
'word from Miss Bingham's eober lips
proclaims her belief that life is worth
living. She walks with the feet of faith
to a goal that she has determined to 2nd
pood. Her conscienceâ worn on her
sleeveâ is comfortably, thoroughly, whole

Bingham rejects a Clyde Fitch play be
cause the star part is "not nice." Mrs.
Campbell willfully plays whatever she
pleases. Miss Bingham wisely produces
what the public wants. And so it goes.
The physical difference is not less
â¢marked. MJss Bingham, with her pale,
gold hairâ worn In the unusual curl, her
clear, pale skin with its tiny gold
freckles, her cool, thoughtful, green-gray
eyes, her small, firm mouth and Jlmply
waisted, trimly molded figure, is the
foil perfect for the somber, careless
beauty of Mrs. CampbelL She looked
tired the other day as she greeted us, but
it. was the happy weariness of the artist
conscious of splendid work done, and, per
suaded of the value of the task, grateful
also for its handsome appreciation by the
public
"You must be pleased to-day," I said,
as we shook hands.
Most seriously. Miss Bingham herself
takes the amusement question. "The
Climbers" production of the evening be
fore, handsomely complete from the
uast's brains to its shoestrings, had
prepared me for any amount of con
science in its producer. It is all there.

In her own country when she returns.
" 'Yes, Bispham was right. To keep in
the first-class the singer or musician,
even though he or she be American born,
must not settle down here. That is al
ways fatal. If they are willing to fall
into the second rank of our local church
and concert singers it will do them no
harm to re here.* "
" 'And he was right. Only a few years
ago a young soprano came to me for ad.
vice. I had already declined to book her
again because I found that the last tlma
I tried it there was very little demand for
her services. I could not even get half
the fees that had formerly been paid to
her. She asked me what in the world to
do.
â¢ "I prefer to remain In England," he
said, "and come over for several months
every year as a singer from Europe. I'm
afraid there would not be much interest
in me if I stayed over here too many
months in the year."
" 'There was a time when not only the
American slngere lived in their own coun
try, but the foreigners stopped here as
well during the summer. Christine Nils
son used to spend her summers between
tours here, while Clara Louise Kellogg
and Annie Louise Cary were never
ashamed to live in their own countries for
some years. But now the shrewd singer
knows enough to fill her professional en
gagements in the United States and have
her home In Europe so she may return to
it just as she. would if she had been born
in Poland, France or Croatia.
" 'In England it makes no difference
whether an artist lives there or not. Mme.

" 'Somebody tried to persuade Ben Da
vies, the English tenor, to settle in tha
United States. But he Reclined laugh
ingly.
" 'For that reason Mme. Nordica. too,
gets away as soon as she can. and so do
all the other American singers who are
able to go. They know how important It
is commercially for them to be identified
with the foreigners who come over every
winter. If they stopped here during the
summer and had their permanent resi
dence in New York they would soon find
themselves left to sing in oratorio, sec
ond-class concerts and musical festivals.
" 'Even the foreign artists who have de
cided to settle here soon find that the pub
lic estimate of them changes. They be
come a part of the local crowd and that is
enough. I remember how popular Del
Puente used to be as long as tie was an
occasional visitor to this country. Once
he settled down here to live the publio
seemed to pay very little attention to
him. Look at the experience of Mme.
Fursch-Madl and Emll Fischer. They
were certainly appreciated enough when
they were on the operatic stage. But one*
they were regular residents of New York
the feeling toward them was very differ
ent.
" 'The opera singers all realize that and
try to get out of the country as soon as
they can after the last performance. They
are more eager about it than the foreign
ers. Suzanne Adams went abroad this
spring because she was going to stag at
Covent Garden. But it is highly Improb
able that either Mme. Nordica or Jim?.
Eames will sins before returning here
next winter. David Bispbam appears oc
casionally In London nowadays, but ha
sings here twenty times for every one ap
pearance in England.
" 'Mrae. Eames has practicallyappeared
during the past ten years only at tha
opera-house in New York. So one would
suppose that residence in this country
would be much more convenient for her.
But she is shrewd enough to see that her
professional value would diminish Imme
diately if she became Identified with local
singers.
" "There is very little doubt of the truth
of it,' the agent said. 'The wisest Amer
can singers are those who can find em
ployment for a certain part of every year
in Europe, and then return here for the
musical season only. I could give you the
names of several American singers who
had acquired very good places in England
âI don't mean the very highestâ and then
to their grief came to this country to live,
thinking that, .being Americans, they had
best settle here. They soon realized that
the people here are very loyal in their de
votion to American singers, but take a
great deal more interest in those who live
abroad than those who stay in the United
States.
"A,8un reporter asked one of the beat
known musical agents in this country
recently if' Mr. Bispham's contention
was true and that musical artists would
suffer by residing permanently in their
own country.
"David Bispham's statement in a Lon
don court that it would be professional
suicide to live in his own country may
sound exaggerated to persons unacquaint
ed with the business phases of a singer's
profession, but it is comprehensible
enough to singers and other musicians
who live abroad and come here only when
their business calls them."

Subsequently the great /sachem visited
the # tribe at Fort Bragg and there the
work of the order was also exemplified
by the adoption of four palefaces. After
the closing of the tribe's council there
was a feast of corn and roast pig and
many toasts were eloquently responded
to. The enthusiasm in Mendocino Coun

probable that In a short time a new tribe,

This report was adopted by a vote of
475 ayes and 87 noes. It is said that the
recommendations are based on an elab

to every member of- the order; that the
"old men" will have several propositions
to choose from and that while "the rate
has been raised to cover the actual cost
of protection" it will protect them in
their old age instead of trying to force
them out as many supposed It would.
The excuse given for not making public
the details of the plan Is that It was
deemed wise not to say anything about
the matter until the plan In detail was

effort was made to have the rate for old
age members Increased from $3 58 for

from the following report:

Cue. Sixth Infantry. U. S. A., being
charged with bigamy, spoke wisely when
Ehe said: "Never marry a man

tons on short acquaintance." Per
haps while she is struggling to forget
the episode she will put it somewhat
stronger. This should certainly be a les
eon to girls never to accept a man whom
they do not know a great deal about. Of
course, members of the fair sex are very
much handicapped in making a just de
cision partly owing to the innate trust
that goes with the feminine temperament
and further because they cannot learn
much about a man's private life if he is
clover. The dull ones we would not want.
