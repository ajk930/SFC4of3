LONDON, Nov. 17.â The Board of
Trade to-day issued an interesting blue
book, containing the report of. Henry
Birchenough, a writer on statistical
and political subjects, who was sent to
South Africa as a special commissioner
to inquire into the present condition
and prospects of British trade in that
'country. ...
In his report Commissioner , Birch
enough lays . stress on the magnitude
of the South African market, which he
says has increased 250 per cent. in the
last ten. years, , the [greatest increase,
however, having been shown in the last
two " years. -The annual value of this
trade now exceeds. the sum of $235,000, -
000, and the commissioner says that the
rapidity, with* which South Africa has
come to the' front; as a great market
for the exploitation, of British manu
factures Is almost startling.

NEWPORT, Or., Nov. 17.â The bodies
of two more men. victims of ths wreck
ed steamer South Portland, have been
washed ashore near the mouth of thÂ»
Siletz River. To one of them a life pre
server was partly fastened, which
bears the words "Steamer South Port

a gold watch was found In the pockets
of one, but with this exception noth

would Indicate their identity.
The finding of the life preserver tends
to confirm the supposition that the

ly TON, Nov. 17.â M. Bunau-Varilla, MinisteiLof Panama,
to-day notified all European powers, through their Embas
sadors and Ministers, of the formation of the. "independent , and
sovereign state of Panama." The French -Embassador, Jusser
and, received the Minister of Panama at the French embassy this
'morning. 1 This reception constituted, it is explained Â¦ by Bunau-
Varilla, .full recognition of the government ,de jure.
Negotiations. for the new canal treaty are well under way al
ready between Bunau-Varilla and Secretary Hay. The commis
sion which arrived in New York to-day is not charged 'with the
negotiation' of the treaty. That power, Bunau-Varilla explained,
is fully vested in himself . But during the negotiations, should he
find it necessary to ask his Government for specific instructions
on any point, he will save time by turning to the commission,
which is expected here to-morrow, instead of cabling to Panama.
It is said, at the State Department ; that Admiral John G:
Walker is charged especially with a solution of the physical
phases of the canal problem, and that he will not interfere in the
present arrangements unless Consul Gudger seeks his advice. The
Panama Canal Company has been prosecuting the work of canal
construction for many months past,' under an agreement with the
State Department, which tacitly -admits the liability of the United
States Government for the cost of continuing this work. It is re
garded as extremely, desirable that there shall be no loss of prop
erty "or 'deterioration in the work' already accomplished, and Ad
miral Walker, who -undoubtedly would be president of the per
manent Canal Commission, if. the United States assume the work
of construction, is crfarged particularly to look after this phase of
the case. 4
//As some part of the French press continues to urge the Pana
ama canal directors to cancel their engagements to.sell the property
td'the United States., it is pointed out at the- State Department
that no such cancellation can be effected without a breach of con
tract that could not be tolerated by, either the French Government
or the Government of the .United States. The nature of the en
gagement between the United States Government and the Panama

t , "Representative Daniels of Riverside,
presidert of the Orange Growers' Na
tional Bank" of that place,' said to-day
that he Is almost entirely Without in
formation as to what has happened to
;H.'T. Hays, who was cashier of the
Orange Growers' Bank and Major Dan
iels' political manager in his fight for
Congress. . He said that whatever had
happened , to Hays had nothing to do
with him politically, personally or
financially."
Representative Daniels said that be
fore he left Riverside for Washington
and while Hays was in New York on a
visit he heard that there had been some
land transactions with the Salt Lake
Railroad,, in which Ilays got a "com
mission." Before It developed Just, what
had been going on Major Daniels came
East. Since then he has heard nothing
except that the Salt Lake Railroad peo
ple were making inquiries with a view
to ascertaining what Hays was doing.
Captain Daniels says that whilg_he
regrets that Hays has got" himself
into trouble it will-have no effect upon
him or upon the Orange Growers' Bank
âthat neither he nor the bank had
anything to do with the matter in any
wayV- - '
known to have personally taken part
in the preliminaries. Shortly before the
scandal became public Diss and Vice
1 President Gibbon were in Salt Lake,
and there Gibbon demanded of Diss a
written statement of the exact status
of Hays with the company. It - was
given him and it stated that Hays was
a confidential agent and described his
duties and powers. It had been intend
ed to spring this upon Hays as a sur
prise when the time came. Hays, how
ever, obtained a copy of the statement
and knew that he was tfeing investi
gated, long before the company was
ready for him to know it. Major Diss'
private secretary .has told the whole
story, although he'lat first denied it.
The rumor will not down that there
are prominent politicians implicated in
the, deals and that certain members of
the Legislature profited, but if the
railroad officials have evidence of this
they have not made It public. They
will not deny the truth of the rumor,
however, but simply refuse to discuss
it. It is not even suspected or hinted
at. that Congressman Daniels, president
of the bank with which Hays was con
nected, hadvany knowledge of the ques
tionable deals in which his cashier was
implicated.. A dispatch to the Times
from /Washington to-night says:
BANK NOT AFFECTED.
Attorney W. M, Peck, who represents
the railroad company in Riverside, ar
rived in Los Angeles to-night and to
morrow will attend a conference of
the leading officials of the road for the
purpose of deciding what oourse shall
be pursued. At this conference will be
decided the question as to whether the
company will proceed criminally
against certain persons who are known
to have been implicated in the steals.
It was learned to-day that there was
one big deal in which the company
was mulcted and that two agents ap
peared personally. The two represent
atives of the railroad company wanted
to . purchase a piece of property in
Riverside owned by Mary J. Mann of
Erie, Pa., on which B. B. Bush had se-'
cured an option for $6000. Bush de
manded $7000 for the property and
finally was told that $500 would be;
given him for his bargain, it being un
derstoo"iiwthat the papers should show
that he had sold for $7000. He agreed
and $500 was placed to his credit In the
Riverside Bank and $6000 sent to Mrs..
Mann. Through the right of way de
partment the railroad company / paid
$S000 for the property, somebody mak
ing $1500 thereby. '
Other similar cases have been discov

have been made public, has Dlss been
ZOS ANGELES. Nov. 17.âAl
though the investigation into
the land frauds by which the

has been made to pay thou

turn has not been completed, the most
Important development thus far since
the sensational denouement which re
sulted in the forced resignation of H.
T. Hays from the Orange Growers' Na
tional Bank at Riverside is evidence
which seems to point to the fact that
many others are involved In the ques
tionable transactions. ,
The railroad officials say. that it will
not be necessary for Major Diss to re
sign, that the investigation which he
invited is now in progress and has. been
In progress for two weeks and . that as
a result . of it the scandal and fraud
were discovered. They, declare^that.if
Diss knew nothing of the gigantic
steals in the department of which he is
the head he is not the man for' the
place, and therefore whether he resigns
or not he must go.
Major Diss has engaged an attorney
to look after his interests, and to-day
there were summoned from Riverside
a number of persons who -have been
close to Hays. To-night for several
hours this party was closeted j with
Diss, but what was done none of those
present would give out. The only state
ment made was that Diss will have
ample defense.

This was confirmed by N. N. Strahan,

The initial cars on the Cottage Grove

to the center of the city without serious
difficulty. As a result the street rail
way officials claimed practically to
have mastered the strike on a second
trunk Jine, the first to be brought under
control being the Wentworth avenue
electric line. r '\ r <
Five trains left the barns near Thir
ty-eighth street, on Cottage Grove ave
nue, for the downtown loop at 9:45
o'clock, a heavy police brigade attend
ing each train. The gripmen were pro
tected by heavy wire screens, while
nearly 1000 patrolmen guarded the line
and kept the crowds moving. Wagons
were hurried along and kept off the
street so far as possible.
A number of pistol shots near the
barns at Thirty-ninth street and Cot
tage Grove avenue startled the non
union employes housed within. For a
rhort time the strike breakers believed
that an attack was being made upon
their stronghold. The shots proved to
have been fired by men who brought
two wagonloads of supplies. Within a
half block of the barns pickets halted
the drivers and demanded that they
turn around and drive back. The driv
ers immediately opened fire and drove
Quickly to the barns. After unloading
the provisions they returned to the
company's headquarters, followed by a
brigade of union pickets.
Tb* object of the* meeting was to
bring the two sides to a point where
arbitration is possible. This the Mayor
believes has been accomplished.
Despite the promising outlook for a
peaceable ending of the trouble in the
near future, the management of the
road will to-morrow renew its efforts
to break the strike. Announcement
was made to-night that an effort would
be made to-morrow to open another of
the branches of the system. The at
tempt will be made on the electric line
running through Indiana avenue, and,
if successful, this will make a total of
three branches that have been opened
for traffic since the inception of the
strike last Thursday.
The Cottage Grove avenue line was

The Peace Commissioners left the
Mayflower at 2 o'clock in the after
noon, accompanied by a number of of
ficers of the vessel. ! On reaching the
landing of the Royal Mall dock the
Commissioners walked by the side of
the officials to the steamer Trente, only
a few yards distant. They presented
the appearance of being prisoners,
: Senors Arosamona and Morales then
delivered addresses In which they ex
pressed views similar to those enun
ciated by Senor Arias.
â¢ The threat of Senor Insignares that
the republic of Colombia would, e^n
force Its alleged rights In isthmian ter
ritory did not cause apprehension, to
the Panaman commissioners, who re-'
celved it with equanimity and did not
give it any serious consideration.
."Colombia will always find in this
country the most sincere brotherly
feeling. The political ties binding' the
isthmus to Colombia have been broken,
but the fault is not that of the isth
mus. TKe ties of affection, however,
can never be broken."
Senor Insignares, in answer, ex
pressed his deep sorrow at finding that
the hopes of reconciliation were im
possible of realization and that the ac->
tiona of the people of the isthmus of
Panama were irrevocable. He de
clared that all the people of Colombia
would unite in an effort to enforce the
rights of the republic on the Isthmus
of Panama even at the cost of great
sacrifices. : U/v
The Panamaians replied that they
woul#l not return to the republic of
Colombia and declared that the assur
ances came too late, as Panama's posi
tion was so advantageous that they
could not see any reason for changing.
During the conference Nikano Insig
nares, a brother of the Governor of the
State of Bolivar and who was the
spokesman of the Colombians, made a
strong appeal to the Panamans not
to disrupt the republic of Colombia,
and he supplemented his appeal by the
solemn assurance that Colombia would
grant all the rights demanded by the
isthmians and eventually carry out
their grand project of building .the
canal.
Replying to Senor Insignares, Tomas
Arias, representing the junta, said that
the Bogota Government and the Co
lombians generally did not appear to
grasp the actual coifcitions prevailing
on the Isthmus. The revolution, Senor
Arias said, was born absolutely ' of
the unanimous desire of the people of
Panama and was irrevocable. Con
tinuing, Senor Arias said:
COLON, Nov. 17. â The Panamaian
Commission, composed of Senors
Arias, Morales and Aiosemena, which
left Panama yesterday to meet the
Peace Commission from the Depart

to-day and held a short conference
with Colombians, who represent only
the Department of Bolivar and. the
Governor of that department* and who
have no credentials from Bogota. The
Colombians asked the Panamaians if
they would return to the republic of
Colombia, assuring them'- concessions
and considerations on the passage of a

I The population of the new republic is
composed of â¢ various elements â Span
ish, Indian, negro and -a limited num
ber of persons â¢ from the European
countries' and the United States, espe
cially those engaged in commerce and
transportation and the operation of the
Panama Railway. A considerable num
ber of the population is composed of
persons brought to the isthmus as la
borers for the construction of the ca
nal, and of their descendants. Since
the abolition of slavery in Jamaica a
considerable number of blacks and mu
lattoes have settled on the isthmus as
small dealers and farmers, and in some
villages on the Atlantic side they are
said to be in the majority. Some of the
native population have retained their
customs, speech and physical type, es
pecially those in the western part of
the province, and claim to be descend
ants of the natives found in that sec
tion by the Spaniards when they dis
covered and conquered the country.
Of the commerce of Panama, the
United States supplies a larger share
than any other country. The importa
tions at the port of Colon during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1903, as
shown by the report of the United
States Consul, amounted to $952,684, of
which $614,179 was from the United
States. $119,086 from France, .$118,322
from England, $76,386 from Germany.
From the port of Panama the exports
to the United States in the fiscal year
1903 amounted to $193,342, of which $56,
767 was hides, $49,974 India rubber, $27,
805 cocobolo nuts, $16,593 ivory nuts.

Colon, or Aspinwall, as it is some

3000 persons. The city of Panama has
a population of about 25,000. It was

built in 1673, while Colon is of much
more recent date, having been founded
in 1855.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â The com

of the State of Indiana. These figures
are supplied by the Department of
Commerce and Labor through its Bu
reau of Statistics, and are the latest
available data on commerce, popula

. The principal ports are Panama, on
the Pacific Coast, and Colon,', on the

SOMETHING ABOUT PANAMA.
For two days, November 4 and '5,
great excitement prevailed in Colon
and many of the foreign residents
sought shelter with their families
aboard the City of Washington. ; .
The Commissioners, on arrival here,
did not know their exact status and de
clined to talk until they had received
the latest intelligence from Washing
ton. They could not say whether they
would go direct to Washington or riot.
Dr. Manuel Echeverri of New -York
met the Commissioners at quarantine.
After some parley the troops went
down on the pier to the British Royal
Mail steamer Atrato to embark for
Cartagena. The commanding officers
in the meantime had gone to. Panama
and the troops were without comman
ders. Colonel Black, with the marines;
taking advantage of the fact that the
troops had all. passed down . the pier,
changed the cotton bale barricades un
til they blocked the pier and refused to
allow the troops to come back to shore.
A fund of $8000 was collected and the
troops were sent, passage prepaid, by
the Atrato to Cartagena.
NEW YORK, Nov. 17.â From, the
foremast * head of the steamer City of
Â¦Washington, which arrived to-day from
Colon, flew. the flag of the republic of
Panama and on board were the. special
Commissioners sent by the new repub
lic to the United States. The Commis
sioners- are Dr) Manuel E. Amador and
Federico Boyd, and with them are Car
los Arozmena, secretary, and Archibald
Boyd, attache. Â¦
The City of Washington was in the
center of the trouble at Colon; and re
ceived on board a large number, of
women and children because- of the
general fear of a clash between the in
surrectionists and the Colombian
troops. There were 500 of these troops
in Colon who demanded transportation
by rail to Panama,, but the railway au
thorities refused to take them. They
marched down to the railroad terminal
and were stopped by United States ma
rines from the United States cruiser
Nashville." The marines had run flat
cars laden with cotton bales in front of
the depot and filled the windows with
bales of cotton, forming barricades
which were manned by marines. . ' Â¦

Secretary Shaw had carefully pre
pared a speech, but toward its end he
departed from It, and he said in part:
"We are going to dig the Panama

"Without attempting to give the rea

stating the fact that forty years ago
we had only one-fourth as much for

now, yet we actually carried in Amer

times as much foreign commerce as we

Secretary Shaw was introduced and
said in part as follows: Â¦
"The only unprotected American in
dustry is its merchant marine. An act
of Congress approved by George Wash
ington, and never repealed, though fre
quently, assailed, gives the American
shipbuilder, the American shipwright,
the American shipowner and the Amer

trade, and we have not only the most
efficient service but the cheapest coast

the State Department. This act ter
minates Foster's connection w^h the
case. The report proper Is a succinct
statement of the issues presented to

Agent Foster Files Hia Report.
Two weeks ago Brockwell's condition
became bo serious that his relatives
became alarmed and asked Dr. Zan to
fee him. Dr. Zan to-day said that he
called at the hefuse of Brockwell and
was refused admission by Brockwell's
wife, a believer in "Dowleism." Dr.
Zan insisted and as an officer of the
law pecured admission. He found
Brockwell seriously ill rrom aggravated
biliousness, that could have been easily
cured by proper medicine.
Six years agro Brockwell was con
verted to Dowie'6 belief and though a
(storekeeper at the- time and a large
salesman of tobacco, he burned hla
stock, countermanded his orders from
the wholesale house for the weed, quit
using it himself and began to send to
Dowie at Chicago regular sums of
money for the advancement of the
work. His fanaticism resulted in im
poverishing his family to such an ex
tent that his wife and three children
are now practically destitute.
PORTLAND, Nov. 17.â Clinging to
his faith in Dowie aa Elijah H. A. Q.
Brockwell, a traveling salesman, died
yesterday after three weeks or more
of serious illness. During that time no
medicine would he taste, no doctor
would he permit to enter his house,
except under the authority of the law,
acd only the prayers of Zionists, who
gathered about his bed nightlyj were
opposed between him and d*ath. Dr.
Zan. the Health Officer, to-day canceled
the death certificate he issued and the
case will be investigated by Coroner
Finley.
Â£;~zl*l XX3?&tcb to Tike Call.
It was learned from papers among
the effects of the deceased that he was
a- landscape gardener. He had been at
Burlingame within the year. A small
sum of money, a watch and other per
sonal effects gave no clew to his iden
tity, but the name Henri Meier, written
on the flyleaf of a memorandum book,
is believed to be his.
SANTA CLARA, Nov. 17.â Lying
with hands crossed on his â¢ breast a
stranger, apparently 50 years of age,
whose name Is supposed to be Henri
Meier, was found dead in his bed at a
lofljring-house here owned by Martin
Dergans this evening.
The man came to Dergans' saloon at
11 o'clock last night and asked for
lodgings. He was told that all rooms
were taken but a small one at the back
of the premises. This he accepted, re
tiring about 11:30 o'clock and locking
himself in. He did not appear this
morning and at 6 o'clock this evening
Dergacs, with assistance, forced the
door and found Meier lying dead on
the bed. There is no evidence of poison
or violence done himself and the con
clusion of Ofllcer D. A. Toomey is that
heart disease was the causÂ« of death.
Coroner Kell was sent for, but had been
called to Madrone.

Is patrolling some of the streets of Ba

Â¦a man known as the "kisser." .The
operations of the latter have terrorized
the female contingent of the New Jer

to go Into the streets unprotected after
nightfall. Those who have fallen Into
his clutches have not been harmed, but
they object strenuously to being sud
denly embraced and kissed against
their wishes. When the husbands
learned of the attacks they determined
to run down the miscreant, some even
going so far as to disguise themselves
in women's clothing,. but the search so
far has been fruitless. ;

TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 17.â Agitation
is in progress In the First Methodist
Church of Tacoma to require women to
remove their hats during worship. The
movement was started by Dr. Daniel L.
Rader, pastor of the church, who in
sists that he cannot preach to the best
advantage when he doesj not see the
eyes of his parishioners. Modern head
gear, with its overhanging effects, does
not permit the pastor to see the faces
or at least the eyes of members of his
congregation. He feels that he is not
obtaining their full Interest and sympa
thy. The men of the congregation ap
prove the stand taken by the pastor,
while strenuous objections are being
raised by members of the gentler sex
and particularly by the young women
who wear new hats which they are not
averse to displaying.
For several months Pastor Rader has
been making a quiet but determined ef
fort to have all female church-goers
doff their bonnets. The point is also
made that if they can remove themln
theaters as required by a city ofai
nance they can also do so in church
while worshiping. The agitation is
rapidly approaching a point where a
flat decision one way or the other must
be made. Possibly a vote of the con
gregation will be taken.

WASCO, Or., Nov. 17.â The people of
this town are congratulating them
selves' that the conflagration that vis

overcome before the whole place was
reduced to ashes. As matters stand
$134,000 worth of property waa de

providentially died out the loss would
have reached to five times that amount.
Fire started In the Oregon Trading
Company's big store about 12:30
o'clock this morning and soon became
unmanageable. The Oregon Trading
Company's store is a total loss, as well
as the opera-house and the Venable
residence. The Oregon Trading Com
pany was the largest general merchan
dise house in Sherman County. George
Crosfleld of the company was severely
burned .in an attempt to save some
valuable papers. At present the ex
tent of his injuries cannot be ascer
tained, but it is thought that they are
not of a fatal nature.

Superintendent H. M. Yerington of
the Virginia and Truckee Railroad Is
a guest at the Palace Hotel, and when
seen last night said:
"My advices from the scene of the
fire have been meager, but from what
I have been able to learn the fire has
about ruirved the tunnel. It is an old
one and demanded the greatest care
to prevent its timbers from becoming
Ignited by sparks from engines. For
that reason we had it lined with sheet
iron. Recently we discovered that the
Iron was becoming affected by contact
with the steam from the engines and
workmen were sent out to overhaul the
Interior. This work was in progress
when the fire was discovered.
"It is a bad time of the year to un
dertake reconstruction work and as yet
I am undecided whether to rebuild the
tunnel or make an open cut in its place.
The work will probably cost about
$40,000, but regardless of the cost we
will start It at once. Meanwhile traffic
over the road will not be interfered
with, for we purpose to run trains up
to the tunnel and carry freight around
the obstruction to the terminus of the
road. Passengers will also be cared for
In a similar manner."
The California and Oregon Coast
Railroad will be 191 miles In length
and will practically follow the line of
the Grants Pass-Crescent City stage
road for a distance of forty-five or fifty
miles south of Grants Pass. The road
will touch at Wilderville. Selma. Kerby.
"Waldo, Crescent City and other points
now reached by the stage road. The
road will also pass within five miles
of the copper mines of the Waldo.
Smelting and Mining Company of San
Francisco, and a branch line will lead
directly to the mines from Waldo to
TakiJma. Colonel Draper states that
hl3 company will build a smelter at
these mines next spring.
. \a has been previously stated in The
Call, the survey for the proposed road
has been completed and the grade
stakes have been set over a large part
of the route. Right of way has also
been secured for a greater part of the
line. Grounds for sidings and stations
have been* granted, and the company
Is ready to begin the actual construc
tion of the road with the arrival of the
spring months.
GRANTS PASS, Or., Nov. 17.â Never
were the prospects of. a railroad from
Grants Pass southward through South
ern Oregon and Del Norte County, Cal
ifornia, connecting with a line being
built north to Eureka, as bright as at
the present time. Colonel Draper, chief
engineer of the recently organized Cali
fornia and Oregon Coast Railroad, of
San Francisco is here and has given
out that there will be plenty doing In
new railroad building from now on.
The new company includes some of the
most influential men of New York,
Milwaukee and San Francisco.
The purpose of the California and
Oregon Coast Railroad is to build a
line from Grants Pass to Eureka. The
new company absorbs the old Oregon
and Pacific and is more extensive in its
scope than the former company, as it
was the original intention to build a
line only from Grants Pass to Crescent
City, while the new road will extend on
south, connecting with the northern
built line to Eureka or some point on
Humboldt Bay.

BAKERSFIELD, Nov. 17.â A most
dramatic scene occurred this afternoon
in the courtroom during the Hulse trial
when Mrs. Rebecca Tlbbet, the aged
mother of "William E. Tlbbet, the offi
cer who Is said to have been killed by
Hulse, took the witness stand,
Mrs. Tibbet is about 75 years old, but,
although feeble, her voice was firm and
calm and was heard in all parts of the
courtroom as she recited the sad scenes
at the side of her dying son.
"When I came to him," said Mrs. Tlb
bet. "he looked at me and said,
'Mother.' I said to him, 'Do you know
me, Will?' He said, 'Yes. mother. I
am suffering terribly. I can't bear It/
I said to him, 'Will, you must bear It;
put your trust In God. You have been
a dutiful son. How is it with your soul?*
He said to me, 'It is well with my soul,
mother. I'm dying.' "
During this recital there was a death
like silence in the crowded courtroom.
One could have heard a pin drop, so
Intense was the stillness.
Richard Smith, Edward Tlbbet.
brother of the murdered officer, and J.
B. Hunt testified to hearing the abov^
conversation and also the statement
of Tibbet that Hulse had shot him.
Miss Calla Wlthington, Mrs. George
Lemay and Mrs. Charles O. Daniel who
reside on K street, about one Nock
from the scene of the tragedy, testified
to hearing the shots fired and seeing a
tall man wearing dark clothes and a
white felt hat standing Just across the
street from the Josshouse. where Peter
Began yesterday testified that Hulse
stopped for a minute or two In his
flight.
Special Dtspatch to ThÂ« Call.
The ground Is of soft formation and
soon caved In, destroying the tunnel
at both ends. The entrances of the
tunnel are now blocked and the fire
will probably rage within for several
days. The loss Is estimated at about
$40,000. arid it will be probably several
weeks before the trains will asain be
running between this "city and Reno.
One of the Virginia and Truckee trains
is stalled at this end of the line.
It is not known here whether the
company will reconstruct the tunnel or
make a cut through the ground. This
wlll.be determined as soon as the engi
neers have gone over the ground and
Superintendent Yerington returns from
San Francisco.

High=Grade Tailoring
Any man, whether young or old, working on a
salary should exercise care in buying his clothes.
He should dress neatly, but at the same time avoid
paying fancy prices.
Exclusive tailors certainly charge exorbitant
prices for Tuxedo and Full Dress Suits. Their profit
â¢Â¦ is enormous, and wh'.le the garments are first class
they cost alrrjost twice what you need to pay.
If you want a fine Tuxedo or Full Dress place an
order here. We will make you a suit at $45 which
will give you perfect satisfaction, and we'll guaran-
tee to save you at least $20.
If you are not pleased you can have your money
back. If you are satisfied and keep the garments the
twenty dollars is well worth saving.

NEW YORK, Nov. 17.â James K.
Johnston, alleged by the police of Eu
rope and America, to whom he was
known as "Jersey Jim," to have been
one of the cleverest thieves in the
world, is dead at Trenton, N. J. He
was born there and grew up in the
church, but suddenly forsaking his
Christian associations, he went to Cali
fornia with the "4D-ers" and opened a
gambling house in San Francisco. In
a year or two he amassed a fortune and
moved to Paris, where he lived in
luxury.
When his money was nearly gone he
returned to America and a few months
ago was arrested for stealing a palp of
shoes.

A gas reservoir, of 80,000 cubic feet
capacity will be suspended pver the
car. This will resemble in shape the
back of a whale, designed so the wind
will under all circumstances strike at
an angle. This, too. will be made of
rawhide or aluminum."*
The contrivance will be raised and
made to soar and its course will be di
rected by power furnished by the gaso
line engine; On each side of the car
will be three wings, or oblong blades,
each with a fiat surface of eighteen
square feet, and each capable of one
beat per second. These will descend
from horizontal to vertical and return.
The first movement forces the car up
ward. Little power will be required for
this, as the gas eliminates the factor of
dead weight. A four-blade propeller at
the back of the craft furnishes driving
power. The steering apparatus Is in
the bow. where long and thin aero
planes direct the course from left to
ripht, up or down.
Â¦ Passenger cars may be attached to
the locomotive car. A parachute at
tachment is a part of the gas holder
and may be detached by pulling on a
rope.
Gilson believes that it will be possible
for a party to go from. here to the St.
Louis World's Fair next year at a
speed of 180 miles an hour. The pre
liminary work of organizing a company
to build the machine and demonstrate
its utility is now under way. A larger
machine than the model will be built
in a short time.
To the fact that other inventors have
depended on gas for their lifting power
Gilson ascribes their failure. In his
machine eras is utilized only to neutral
ize the weight of the contrivance. The
Gilson machine resembles the hull of
a racing automobile, with a rudder at
the prow. The car will be built of
aluminum or rawhide and will be thirty
feet long by ten wide. A depression
will be made in the center for a gaso
line engine to develop eighty horse
power.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Nov. 17.â Samuel
H. Gilson, discovery of Gilsonite and
a leading coal operator, has perfected,
after thirty years of experiment, a ma
chine which he confidently believes^ will
solve the problem of aerial navigation.
The model of the machine has finally
been completed and it works success
fully.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
Much, like a bigger Massenet of "M.a
nnn Lesoaut" is the Leoncavallo of
"Zaza." There is little to remind of the
composer of "rPadiacci," with its
ripe, red-blooded, big-shouldered genius.
Properly "Zaza" belongs almost to the
penus opera comJque. As an exposition
of the "Zaza" phychology the petting:
can hardly be said to be particularly
luminous. It lacks largely in the dra
matic element. Again, however, there
is a marked lyrical value, a melodious
quality, that is destined to make the
opera an easy favorite among audi
ences. Lyrics abound, whistleful in char
acter, and the orchestration â as one
can glimpse It from the Tivoli capaci
ties â is remarkably graceful.
The only Zaza the Tivoli list affords
is De Spada, who, piquant and intelli
gent enougrh. is hardly the passionate,
sultry locked person Mrs. Carter has
led us to demand. De Spada leaves the
led hair to her mamma and offers a
sort <>f gentle amalgam of Lucia and
Nedda on the dramatic Fide. Greprorettl
as Cascart has a very congenial role,
that he hasn't fully shaken into yet.
He has a song In the second act with
Zaza that was wildly applauded and
which Is one of the best in the opera.
Ischierdo has the lover's role. Dufresne,
and is sufficient, though not affable in
the part. There are a number of small
er parts excellently taken, Cloe Mar
chesinl as a comedy mother, Dado as
Bussy the Journalist, Cortes! as a the
atrical manager and Miss Barker as a
soubrette noticeable among them. Toto,
the child, done !>y a little Italian girl,
was one of the best bits in the opera.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Of course the conditions debar Justice
to any of those concerned, conductor,
cast, orchestra, and not least, the com
poser. But it may be Immediately said
that wonders have been done under the
circumstances. The opera went clearly,
smoothly, and with considerable spirit
liist night, and one cannot but believe
Mr. Pu-indorfTs reading of the work to
be pomethins? very like the composer's
intentions. The â¢"Zaza." is indeed one
â¢ if th# best things that has been done
in this not too brilliant season, and in
the circumstances extraordinary- On
the -wholp, too, the opera was received
with notable favor, some of the many
charming arias Immediately hooking to
the attendant par, and applause being
ppnerous.
The production is extremely interest
ing, therefore, as an example of what
the Tivoli can do purely on its own
"hook" â with, moreover, about one
tonth of the time needful, and perhaps
half the straw necessary for the
"Zara" brick.
The Tivoli cut a new notch in its his
tory last night, when the little opera
house produced for the first time in
America the new Leoncavallo opera
"Z&za." The task Is probably the most
ambitious the Tivoli has attempted. To
begin with the opera was new to all
those concerned in its presentation.
Neither Mr. Steindorff. the singers nor
the orchestra had taken part in it be
fore, nor ever heard the work, except
in 'the case of one or two of the princi
pals.
Mr. Coughlin has resided in Alameda
for the last eleven years. He leaves
five childrenâ Timothy C. and Robert
E. CouKhlin of Alameda, William C.
Coughlin of Annapolis. Mrs. W. U.

stone of Haywarda.
The funeral will be held Wednesday
at 9:30 a. m. from the undertaking par
lors of Smiley & Gallagher, thence to
St. Joseph's Church. Interment will be
at St. Mary's Cemetery.
Mr. Coughlin came to the United
States when a boy and began his ca
reer as a railroad man on the Boston
and Albany Railroad, running from
Springfield to Boston. He -was one of
the first railroad men to come to the
Pacific Coast and assisted In running
the first line of rails into Livermore
Valley and Oakland from San Joaquin
County.
Mr. Coughlln's demise was undoubt
edly hastened by the death of his wife,
which occurred only nine months ago.
Her passing was a bereavement from
the effects of which he never fully re
covered-

more than two weeks. The deceased
was a. native of Ireland, 54 years of
age.

The discussion of resolutions took 3 up
the entire afternoon. The final form of
the polygamy declaration was s fixed
after an Oklahoma delegate objected to
the proposition that no more States be
admitted to the Union until an anti
polygamy amendment to the national
1 constitution has been adopted. Mrs.
Weed insisted that Senator Reed
Smoot, as an elder in the Mormon
church, is under the most solemn obli
gation to uphold the doctrine and pur
poses of the Mormon church, which is
the overthrow of the United States
Government and the substitution of
another Government, which is that of
the Mormon church. The resolutions,
as adopted, follow: â¢ .

"We believe that all the women of

"We believe that polygamy is both
taught and practiced in the United

to substantiate the claim that Utah has
broken faith with the United States in
this matter. We ask Congress to J>ro

"We also believe that an apostle qt

co-respondent in the case, who, Mrs.

self into, a political party. Delegate
Max Hayes of Cleveland, one of the
leading socialists in the convention,
was on his feet in a moment to protest
against the report, and he was loudly
applauded by the spectators in the gal
lery. He moved the following substi
tute for the committee's report:
"Since wages can never be regarded
as the full equivalent' for labor toll, this
convention recommends that the work
ers use their political and economical
power-along- the. lines 'of their class in
terest to secure for labor the full pro
duct of its toil."

the bills were for pensions and the bulk
of the. petitions related to- the case of
Senator Smoot : of ' Utah. ; The Senate
then went Into executive session and
ten minutes later adjourned.
Senate's Session . Is Short.
Douglass of New- York and Morrell
of Pennsylvania spoke on the Repub
lican side in favor of the /bill and Ma
con of Arkansas, Thomas of North
Carolina, Hughes of New Jersey and
McDermott of New Jersey on the Dem
ocratic side also spoke In -favor of the
bill. ...;;-
Crumpacker (R.) of Indiana said re
ciprocity was not in harmony with the
tariff policy of this country, as ex
emplified in the last two Republican
tariff bills; It was not scientific, he
added, and a reciprocity policy based
on special agreements with all com
mercial powers arrested the operation
of economic laws. He said that if we
were to have a permanent reciprocity
policy we should put a tax on non
competitive articles, that we might
have something upon which to nego
tiate.
"Two years ago Cuba was on the
verge of bankruptcy and that she has
escaped luin is not due to any effort
on our part. That she has been able
to exist at all during the last two years
is because of two reasons: First, the
change in her government; second, the
marketing of an increased amount of
tobacco and sugar. In 1902 the spec
tacular and extravagant rule of Gen
eral Wood, having saddled upon Hava
na for ten years the infamous gambling
monopoly of the Sociedad Anonima Jai
Alai, gave place to the conservative,
economical, sensible and business-like
administration of President Palma.
who has proved himself an executive of
the very highest order."
After quoting figures, McClellan said:
"In other words, under President Pal
ma the cost of government is more than
$7,000,000 less per annum than it was
under General Wood."
In conclusion, McClellan said:
"And now, at last, after years of
awaiting, after the spectacle of an in
solent lobby practically dominating the
Congress, we propose to partially fulfill
our pledge to Cuba by giving her this
tupenny measure of relief that is war-,
ranted not to offend the susceptibili
ties of the most sensitive trust in exist
ence. We have made a % solemn promise
to Cuba. If a Republican majority in
its might is only willing to partially
keep that promise, the blame and the
shame rest with the Republican party.
But the bill is unquestionably a breach
in the wall of protection."
OPPOSED TO RECIPROCITY.
In the course of bis remarks McClel
lan said:
ASSAILS GENERAL WOOD.
Answering the statement that there
was no reason why the bill should be
passed because no benefits accrued to
the United States he said:
"In view of the formal obligations
which we are under to Cuba, this ob
jection is selfish; but even this objec
tion can be met."
He said the liberal concessions made
by Cuba In the treaty "should certain
ly permit the United States to obtain
virtual monopoly of the Cuban mar
kets."
McClellan of New York followed. He
said there was an argument in favor
of the enactment of the bill which rose
above all others and Involved the duty
and honor of the United States.
"As we have made it impossible for
Cuba," said McClellan, "to seek alli
ances elsewhere, it is a duty we cannot
shirk to permit her to enter into the
closest political and commercial rela
tions with us."
McCLELLAN'S
"Your Uncle Mark invented 'Let well
enough alone.' He afterward converted
this into f Stand pat.' and then the able
chairman of the Ways and Means Com
mittee (Payne) added a little 'Keep on
letting well enough alone'; and then,
when your Uncle Mark was being
punched over the ropes out in Ohio by
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt and Sen
ator Foraker, he added, 'For God's
sake, let's keep on letting well enough
alone.' "
Clark (D.) of Missouri, speaking of
the rule cutting off amendments to the
bill, said the probability was that the
Democrats would control the next
House and elect the next President,
adding:
"The more of these ironclad rules
you ram down our throats, Â£he more
you will have rammed down yours."
Turning his attention to the Cuban
bill, Clark declared with emphasis that
the Republicans could not pass the bill
without the Democratic vote in the
House, adding: "And you know it."
Clark then got back to politics and
quoted what he termed Republican bat
tle cries. Said he:
BOAST OF A DEMOCKAT.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â The House
to-day resumed consideration of the
Cuban bill. The only r.otable incidents
of the day were the speeches of Stev
ens, a Republican member from Minne
sota, who spoke in opposition to the
bill, and tha speech of Mayor-elect Me-
Clellan of New York. Stevens opposed
the measure for reciprocity .with Cuba
at the last session. To-day he argued'
that the bill was a "cruel blow" at one
of the most important agricultural in
dustries in this country and that the
measure would Imperil our vast foreign
trade. McClellan delivered his valedic
tory to the House, making an argument
in favor of the bill, during the course
of which he criticized the administra
tion of General Wood in Cuba and
charged the Republicans with Responsi
bility for what was lacking in the ful
fillment of the duty of the United
States to Cuba. Four hours were de
voted to-day to debate on the measure,
ten members speaking. Under the rule
two days more are given for speeches.
The engineer received warning and
stopped his train before reaching the
loosened rail. The military to-day ar
rested H. H. McKinney. who was held
a. .prisoner lr> the guardhouse for four
t**?n days in September, and several
others who are suspected of complicity
in the alleged p!ot.
CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo.. Nov. 17.â
An alleged attempt to wreck a passen
sor train, filled with miners returning
from work, by removing the spikes and
f.fh plates from a rail on the Florence
snd Cripple Creek Railroad In Eclipse
Gu'ch, was frustrated earlv to-day
The cold wave last night brought two
inches of snow, with the temperature
only four degrees above zero, but there !
is as yet no suffering from lack of fuel !
and practically no shortage, the dealers j
having abundance in storage. Â¦
DENVER, Nov. 17.â "We are not con- |
Fidering the question of bringing in coal I
from the East," said General Manager j
"Welborn of the Colorado Fuel and Iron |
Company to-day, "for the reason that j
our supply Is ample. We have more j
miners working now than at any time j
Fir^e the strike began and each day ]
Edds to our output."
Â¦ Retail coal- dealers who have hereto- {
fore obtained their supplies principally |
from the Northern Colorado coal fields)
decided at a conference to-day to bring
ooa] from the East for their customers,
and an order was telegraphed for a
large shipment from Missouri River
points. Th'.s coal will be sold to con
sumers in Denver at 57 25 a ton. Here
tofore similar cnal produced in Colo
rado has been sold here at $4 to $1 50 a
ton.
in Las Animus and Huerfano counties.
The cold weather to-day caused a great
deal of suffering among strikers' fami
lies, who are living in tents near the
coal camps. All strikers at Hastings
have been warned to vacate the com
pany's houses at once.
. Another large shipment of miners
left here to-night for the different coal
fields of the South and Middle West. A
large crowd at the station bid them
godspeed, and the demonstration when
the train pulled out was deafening.
The report reached here that 200 men
had returned to work at Hastings to
day, but this proved to be untrue. A
nan from that camp arrived in Trinidad
to-night and states that not a man is
Â¦working there. Hastings is a Victor
Fuel Company camp, and trouble is
feared there. Five extra deputies were
sent out to-night to join a large num
ber of guards already at Hastings.
Major Hill of the Colorado National
Guard has been in Trinidad the past
three days investigating the conditions
for Governor Peabody, but succeeded
fo well in keeping his identity hid that
only a few knew of his presence until
to-day. No trouble of any kind has
been reported to the Sheriff's office up
to to-night.
PUEBLO, Colo.. Nov. 17.â Officials of
tf;e Colorado Fuel and Iron Company
claim to-day that the coal miners'
Ft like will now be solved effectually in
their favor by aid from the steel and
iion works men, who have been laid off
here and who are going to the coal
mines. More than 2000 of the workmen
in several departments of the steel
works were laid off on Saturday, when
those departments were suspended on
account of the cutting off of the coal
supply by the strike. Many of the men
determined that they would go to the
company's mines and dig coal. A car
load of them was taken yesterday to
the big Walsen mine, near Walsenburg,
and began operation of the coal cut
ting machines. Officials of the com
pany state that they will now soon
have plenty of coal and that they will
altogether Ignore the Miners' Union.

NEW ADVERTISEMENTS.
This remedy, which is sold by all
druggists at . the low price of fifty
cents, is in suppository form, is ap-
plied directly to the parts affected, and
performs its work quietly and pain-
lessly. The Pyramid Drug Co/, Mar-
shall, Mich., will mail free to any ad-
dress a book telling 'all about piles or
hemorrhoids.^their cause and cure.
A suggestion is offered that. if the
reader is afflicted, or knows any one
who is, this book be sent for, as, it will
be found invaluable. : >' ; : â¢ '
The writer personally knows people
who were afflicted with the worst form
of bleeding and protruding piles and
who were permanently cured by the
use of Pyramid ; Pile Cure. In every
one of these cases the attending phy-
sician ' had assured ' the sufferer ; that
only by an operation could he rid him-
self of the disease; so much for the in-
fallibility of the doctors.
The present day surgeon appears to
be possessed by a mania for operating,
especially in cases of hemorrhoids or
piles, and while the greater number of
the profession do not recommend this
"last resort" unless they honestly be-
lieve It necessary, the fact remains that
much needless operating is done, - and
the patient put to much expense and
suffering for what? ,
To obtain a possible temporary re-
lief; these words are used advisedly,
because in nine cases out of ten the
affliction returns and the patient is
Just where he started from. Often-
times he could be cured much more
simply and easily by the use of such
a remedy as the Pyramid Pile Cure;
this has come to be recognized as the
best remedy on the market for
the painful disease named, and the
druggists now sell more of it than 'all
other pile remedies combined.
Has it ever been your unhappy lot
to be* told by your physician that you
must go to a hospital and submit to
an- operation? If so, you remember
Â¦with what dread and shrinking you
awaited the day when you must endure
the 'knife. '

NEXT SUNDAY CALL
Gold Weather Special in
UnderwearJohn Hays Hammond . telegraphed
that, he would attend the convention
if possible. President Belshaw in re
sponse asked Hammond to address the
delegates.
An invitation was received from
State Mineralogist Aubury to visit the
State Mining Bureau.
The delegates then settled down con-
Samuel Shortridge made a speech In
favor of the institution of a national
department of mines and mining, in
which there were flashes of fun. Presi
dent Belshaw appealed to the risibili
ties of the house by defining the differ
ence between the miner and the mining
operator. "The miner," he said,
"makes his money in the mine and
comes to the city to spend It. The
mining operator makes his money in
the city and goes to the mines to
spend it."
Colonel Hanbury and Captain Hart
of the California Debris Commission
spoke briefly. Colonel Hanbury said
that aa a member of the commission
he was pleased to meet the miners.
He wished to do what he could for the
miners. He also had the Interests of
the agriculturists to consider. Captain
Hart followed the lead of Colonel Han-
Bury In Baying little. Both commis
sioners were complimented with a
round of applause. ' Â¦
problems of mining through the
agency of papers read by men identi
fied with mining Interests. The day

on the color of humor on occasions.

were principally devoted to
scientific discussion of various
The mines on the mother lode were
minutely described by the speaker, who
compared the strata and fissures of the
mines of one county with those of other
counties, all proving the presence of
the mother lode. The structural and
geological formations were explained
with minute detail by the speaker, who
further stated that In some portions
of Calaveras County the gold bearing
veins ran down to a depth of 3000 feet

"Slate Making" was the subject of
the paper presented to the convention
by.C.H. Dunton of Placervllle, who is
connected with the Eureka Slate Com
pany, the only organization quarrying
for slate in California. The speaker
compared the formation of California
slate with that of Eastern States and
showed that the California product was
far ahead of, the Eastern formations
He stated that the -slate beds ; in El
Dorado County j were inexhaustible and
that , the slate possessed the qualities
demanded for good" roofing. The Cali
fornia slate also had the quality of
being a, non-conductor of heat It re
sisted acids, it could- be split into thin
sheets and also wrought into designs.
Ex-Senator E. C. Voorhies read a
very interesting paper on "The Use of
Crude Oil in Roasting Sulphurets."
He explained how the former wood
burning furnaces had been converted
into crude oil burners and spoke of
the vast Improvement achieved by the
new method of applying heaf. He de
scribed the power of the flame from
the oil burner and said It could be
thrown into any part of the furnace
where the ores were being treated.
Senator Voorhles stated that by the
use ,of crude oil the capacity of the
roasting furnaces had been increased
one-fifth over the capacity when wood
was used as fuel and that the new
method :was a decided success. He
also compared the cost of using wood
and crude oil as fuel for the furnaces
and the saving of expense by the wise
use of fuel.
"The Mother Lode" was the Bubject
of an address by ex-State Mineralogist
W. H. Storms. The address was lis
tened to with marked interest and the
speaker was heartily cheered at the
close of his remarks. He described the
peculiar formations in the various
counties of the State, which indicate
the presence of the mother lode, which
varied from a width of ten feet in Ama
dor County to three miles in Calaveras
County. Â¦' . '
In the fiscal year 1900 the income of
the 'mints of America was $12,381,966 51,
while all operating expenses were
$1,737,625 66, leaving a net profit of $10,
,644,340 85.

Superintendent' Leach then explained
how all the mints in America were on
the same basis, being under the super
vision of the director of the mint,
branch mints having been abolished
some years ago."
that it was impossible to return the
actual gold to the owner who brought
it to the Mint and who desired to have
It coined. Such a process would be
very expensive.
The speaker then described the pro
portions Â¦ of gold and silver usually
found In the bullion and dust. # He ex
plained that a person who brought gold
buUion to the Mint did not receive the
value -for the- weight of the metal.
Fifty ounces of bullion might contain
eight ounces of silver and the Govern
ment paid for the gold and silver sep
arately.
He then explained the various sums
charged by the Mint for melting and
for the proportion of silver that always
remained in the gold after it had pass
ed through the melting process.
"Fine, gold" was explained to be 990
parts pure gold in each 1000 parts, 990
being the standard* for fine gold. The
remaining ten parts of the 1000 would be
silver or base metals.

William C. Ralston, former president
of the California Miners' Association,
was spoken . of last evening as the
probable champion who would voice
the wishes and defend the attitude of
the miners. The statements made 1 by
Secretary Benjamin about "spies under
pay of the Anti-Debris Association" Is
a brand sure to communicate fire to the
controversy when it begins to rageJ
The fight will be to prevent the asso
ciation from putting itself on record in
favor of the hydraulic programme. The
miners say their purpose is to proceed
strictly within the terms of the Cami
netti law, but that they desire all, the
rights to which that law entitles them.
The events of to-day are eagerly awaitl
ed. The miners think there la ..little
doubt that their information is correct
and that Johnson will be on hand when
the proper time comes to make opposi
tion.
j as the champion or attorney of the
Anti-Debris Association.
Professor Christy then detailed freely
in. a paper that will be published by
the California Miners' Association the
various processes and results involved
in his experiments which covered a pe
riod of years. He told of apparatus; of
determinations concerning what is
commercially valuable or otherwise in
the line of sulphurets; in fact, opened
to the wondering and scientifically in
clined miners a new domain. The gen
eral public may not be Interested in the
methods, but the significance will ap
pear from some general statements
made, by Professor Christy In the be
ginning. ; ,
This was in substance th'at he had
been engaged between six and seven
years experimenting at the laboratory
of the University of California. There
was a time when a mine would not be
worked unless the free gold was suffi
cient to pay a profit. There were limi-
tentedly to a day of listening to pa
pers regarding mining problems. The
first of the series was by E. A. Rix,
in which the subject of "Compressed
Air in Mining" was admirably treated
from the purely technical point of view.
Then came an address by Professor S.
B. Christy of the University of Califor
nia on "Cyaniding of Sulphurets."
Miners who listened to this address
declared that the information imparted
by Professor Christy would be worth
millions of dollars to the mining in
dustry of California. The speaker pre
faced his remarks regarding cyaniding
by the statement that he had been in
vited by capitalists to engage with
them in enterprises based upon the dis
coveries made by him in laboratory
relating to the cyaniding of sulphurets.
He had made no engagement ' with
them. . . .
' F. 'A. Leach," superintendent of the
San Francisco Mint, addressed 1 the con
vention on "Modern Mint Methods."
He told how bullion and gold dust were
received at the 'mint and the various
stages they went through before the
owners were paid for their gold. He de
scribed- the methods of . receiving;; the
gold; the weighing, melting and assay
ing and coining. the precious ijietal Into
money for general use. He explained
Professor Christy said that he had
discovered that one pound of Iron, es
pecially where it was in a powdery
form, was capable of destroying seven
pounds of the cyanide of potassium.
He had found that the old-fashioned
arastra was an excellent agency for
crushing the ore. Huge blocks of stone
were dragged over the ore. The aras
tra was lined with cement. -Coarse sul
phurets carried the values. . Fine ones
yielded readily.
A flint mill was used^successfully in
the processes. This device could be im
proved by a revolving cylinder of Iron
lined with concrete. The best form of
apparatus would be a cylinder with a
cone. Professor Christy said, that he
had extracted 99 per cent of the gold in
pyrites in half an hour. It-was not easy
to remove the cyanide solution from the
ore. The mode of decantation as com
pared with filtration was preferable.
Filtration was physically possible, but
impracticable.. Ninety to 95 per cent of
the gold in sulphurets could be extract
ed profitably where five to ten/ tons
were worked , per day. A smaller
amount,, as the 'cost would be large for
facilitfes, would not pay.
Samuel Shortridge *spoke about the
various departments of the . Federal
Government and declared that no one
man could run the Governmentâ "no,
nor any Individual newspaper either."
This thrust at the Hearst newspapers
brought forth laughter. Various inter
ests in the country,,, Mr.. Shortridge
said, had secured, by keeping at It, de
partments to foster their work. | The
agriculturists had a department.
Recently the Department j of . Com
merce had been created. The farmers
of the. country were said to have been
born "like native sons, kicking." They
make their kicking good by securing
the institution of the Department of
Agriculture. There was good in kick
ing. The miners should keep at what
they are seeking to have accomplished
and should kick some. Mr. Shortridge
said that while the 'resources of Call-,
f ornia" were varied and to j some -Â¦ .ex
tent independent, the mining industry
could, If agriculture, commerce' and
manufacturing in California should sud
denly be stricken with disaster, go it
alone. Concerning the value_of kick
ing, a story was about v the two
frogs In. the milkpan. One grew faint
hearted, sank and was drowned. , The
other frog kept kicking until the milk
was turned to butter. Then he climbed
out onTthe butter. ' . Â¦ -

tatlons to â¢ chlorlnation. There were
many mines in the- State where the per
centage of -sulphurets" was not high;
many more in which ..there were $25
sulphurets to the ton. than'*125 to the
ton. There were ores in" which the gold
ran only $3 to the ton, whereas the sul
phurets, if extracted, .would be worth
many times that sum. How to get* out
the sulphurets profitably? That has
been one of the great"problems of mod
ern mining. Professor Christy proceed
ed to tell about that.
Sulphurets, he said, are not all the
same. The simplest are those that con
tain only iron pyrites -and gold. In
some sulphurets the gold Is mechani
cally inclosed. In others it is chemical
ly combined. Where the gold is chem
ically combined the difficulty of treat
ment is greater. Ore at $3 per ton had
been determined to contain sulphurets
worth $27 per ton. S
DAMAGE BY LEON. '
In closing his address Mr. Dunton
stated that $1,000,000 worth of American
slate roofing had been exported in the
last year and that there was a good
opportunity for the investment of cap
ital in the industry in California, but
it would require a quarter of a million
dollars to properly equip and operate
a quarry.
F. W. Griffin dealt with the subject of
"Gold Dredging" in the paper- he pre
sented to the convention. He described
the dredgers now in use In California
and in other parts of the world and how
by their use it was possible to work on
land that was formerly considered of
no value. The machinery of the dredg
ers was explained and the method by
which gold-bearing sand was drawn ud
and passed over screens and tables with
Mr. Dunton then dwelt upon the "pro
cess of pressure in ages of long ago
that resulted in the formation of the
slate deposits and gave a description
of the quarries with which he Is con
nected and the method of -using an
aerial tramway for conveying the slate
to the railroad at fPlacerville.
The advantages of slate for roofing
were shown by comparative figures,
proving the life- of slate to be seventy
years, as against fifteen years for
shingles. The cost of repairing a slate
roof was one-third as much as that of
its cheapest competitor, the shingle
roof.'

SACRAMENTO, Nov. 17.â In resolu
tions unanimously adopted at a meet
ing of the State Anti-Debris Associa
tion in this city to-day the association
declares the hydraulic miners should
realize that the conditions that form
erly prevailed In California can never
be resumed and that the navigable
rivers and agricultural Interests of the
Sacramento Valley must not be sacri
ficed to private gain. The resolutions
were brought forth as stated in the
preamble by the published reports that
an effort will be made at the Miners'
Association Convention in San Fran
cisco to take steps to prevent the Anti-
Debris Association in the prosecution
draullc mining injurious to the rivers
of the Sacramento Valley and adjoining
lands.
The resolutions declare that the Anti-
Debris Association shall not be deterred
in the work it is doing by any such
threats; that it has no war against any
other kind of mining than hydraulic,
and only then when such mining is in
jurious to the valley Interests. The
resolutions assert that the association
has no power to stop any hydraulic
mine, unless it is run contrary to law,
and that the declaration made by the
officers of the Miners' Association that
efforts should be made to stop the Anti-
Debris Association in the prosecution
of suits against hydraulic miners doing
injury is a declaration that they will
not be bound by the laws of the coun
try.
"All that we ask," the resolutions
proceed, "is the protection tc the prop
erty interests of the valley guaranteed
us by the constitution and laws of the
land, and that protection we shall
have."
The resolutions were presented by
Dr. D. P. Durst of Tuba County. M.
J. Dillman, chairman of the Board of
Supervisors of Sacramento County, pre
sided at the meeting. The association
is made up of representatives from val
ley counties.
OPPOSES i HYDRAUUCSINO.
"Hydraulic mining would be exten
sively renewed within the area drained
by Weaver Creek and Its branches if
suitable provision could be made for
preventing the resulting debris from
reaching the navigable rivers of the
Sacramento Valley. With the view of
determining the feasibility of the erec
tion of such a barrier In Weaver Creek
as would successfully bring about this
result, your committee has made care
ful examination of a site for a dam
on that creek which is admirably
adapted to such purpose.
'Tour committee estimates that a
dam constructed at this point fifty feet
in height would back water up Weaver
Creek for about one mile, and that It
would have an average width of about
one-half mile, thus covering an area
These general facts are known to the
members of the Anti-Debris Associa
tion, through the complete report of
Betehaw's rpeeeh as it was reported in
The Call yesterday morning. The re
port of the El Dorado County Miners'
Association committee was published In
the mining news of The Call last Sat
urday morning. Some extracts from
the report are repeated that the sit
uation as represented may be fully un
derstood by the general public. The
report contains the following passages:
WHAT EL DORADO WAITTS.
Subsequently Mr. Plckett from El

Weaver Creek dam. and it was referred
to the committee on dams, which will
report favorably. The committee on

was about the Lick House, the head
quarters of the delegates to the con
vention, lact night that Grove L. John-
Bon of Sacramento, appearing as a del
egate, will oppose. In bahalf of the Anti-
Debris Association, the aim of the mi
ners, as set forth in President C M.
Belshaw'e address, referring to hy
draulic rowing. The words spoken bj
Belshaw are here repeated:
"During the last year nothing has
been doao along the line for which the
association was first formed, that is to
make hydraulic mining onoe more pos
sible In this State. I believe that good
work should be done along this line.
"I have been credibly Informed that
by placing a dam In Weaver Creek, El
Dorado County, at a cost of not to ex
ceed $35,000, a majority of the hydraulic
mines in that county will be enabled to
resume work. In my judgment this as
sociation should appoint a committee to
Investigate this matter, with power to
give the indorsement of the association
to the building of this dam, and if the
plan meets with their approval, to urge
upon the State and Federal officials the
necessity and feasibility of the work.
It is our duty to foster hydraulio min
ing under the Caminetti act, and we
Ehould lend financial aid, if need be, to
those who are endeavoring to mine un
der the law and are meeting with or
ganized opposition."
When Belshaw made these state
ments there eat In front of him the
chairman of the El Dorado .County Mi
ners' Association committee, instructed
to enlist the aid of the California Mi
ners' Association In Its attempt to have
a dam to restrain debris built on Weav
er Creek, that hydraulic mining may
lÂ»e resumed in El Dorado County on a
large scale. The delegates to the con
vention, who numbered about 250, as
reported by the committee on creden
tials, applauded the utterances of their
president. No one rose after the ad
dress to express any dissent. The con
vention, seemingly, was of the same
mind as President Belshaw.
IT Is predicted by the delegates that
the hottest flgnt that has ever taken
place on the floor of a convention
of the California Miners' Associa-
riffles while the tailings were deposited
some distance In the rear of the dredge.
Mr. Griffin stated that $4,500,000 was
Invested In gold dredges In California,
and of this amount only $200,000 had
been subscribed by residents of the
State. With a dredge having a month
ly capacity of 40,000 cubic yards, the
cost of dredging one cubic yard is 6!i
cents, while with a machine with a ca
pacity of 70,000 cubic yards the cost of
dredging one cubic yard is less than 5
cents.
SUPPORT OF CONGRESSMEN.
President Belshaw read letters from
Congressmen T. A. Bell and J. N. Gil
lette, who are now In 'Washington at
tending the extra session of Congress.
Both expressed their hearty sympathy
with the alms of the Miners' Associa
tion and pledged, themselves to support
any legislation that may be desired.
C. H. Dunton and Thomas Clark were
added by the president to the commit
tee on revision of the constitution . of
the association. â¢
A committee of three members was
.appointed to draft a memorial to the
members of the association who have
died during the last year. The presi
dent appointed Senator Voorhles, J. B.
Tregloan and C. S. Osborne.
Harry P. Stow of the Forbes .Town
mine, Butte County, presented afpaper
on "The Use of Canvas Plants in Con
centrating."
The principal points dwelt upon were
that length of canvas was more essen
tial than the width; that the gold-bear
ing pulp should be run over two tables
and that water should not be used un
der pressure in cleaning the canvas
sheets of their precious deposits. He
also advocated the use of many set
tling boxes under the canvas- plants.
The convention then adjourned until
this morning at 9:30.

A great stir has been caused among
the members of the Anti-Debris Asso
ciation by reason of these several ut
terances proceeding from the leading
officers of the California Miners' Asso
ciation, This has led, so the story runs,
to a determination to light the hydrau

of at leapt S20 acres, and having a ca
pacity when filled of more than 12,000,
000 cubic yards of material. Inasmuch
as the dam would be several miles
down the creek from where the prin
cipal mining operations would be car
ried on and the coarser part of the
dislodged material would never reach
the site of the dam. your committee be
lieves it safe to assume that such a
dam would provide for the dislodge
ment of at least 50,000,000 cubic yards
of material as it now lies in the banks
to be mined and would impound and
restrain the same above the proposed
barrier for all time to come."
In addition to this, the substance of
a letter by Secretary Benjamin of the
California Miners' Association has been
made public, In which the following
statements of purpose were made:
"It Is claimed by many that the Anti-
Debris Association is largely of the
blackmail order, and that mines are
permitted to run that pay tribute to
the spies of the association and that
legitimate miners are Â¦ estopped. It is
also purposed to urge at the next ses
sion of the Legislature of this State ap
propriations for the construction of
dams in various parts of the State that
will materially aid in rehabilitating the
great industry of hydraulic mining. An
appproprlation of $800,000 has been se
cured and the Government engineers
are at the present time engaged in con
structing barriers In Yuba County
which it Is hoped will materially aid
the hydraulic miners In the regions be
hind these structures. There are many
other places in the State where dams
can be built that will greatly aid the
mining Industry, and it is purposed to
urge this matter vigorously at the com
ing convention."

a pleasure trip to this city, but the fol-
lowing was his condition In- January of

He â¢was-, Insensible and had been for

swollen with dropsy that they could not
be crossed, and he was passing from
one convulsion Into another, being the
culmination of a chronic case of Brlght's

ly, and neighbors were in to be with his
wife at the end. The attending physi-
cian said medicine was powerless. An-
other physician was called in. and know-
Ing the claims made for Fulton's Com-
pound he euggested a trial. He did not
.have the slightest idea anything could
be done, but He knew the case was be-
yond orthodox medicine.
The compound was forced between
clenched teeth. The second day he be-
gan to raliy. -The third he regained con-
sciousness and declared that the head-
aches, (uraemic). which are at times
excruciating in thesÂ« extreme cases, had
disappeared. In a week he showed
marked improvement, bis sight began to
return, the dropsy started down and In
a month he was out and over his farm
as usual. He has - now felt well for
many months and his trip to this city
is purely for pleasure, but his recovery
was so remarkable he r.nd his wife call-
ed to relate their experience. The phy-
sician Is one of the best In Sonoma

anybody at this seeming miracle al-
though it was his own suggestion that
saved the patient's life, and he and the

HOW .TO CO-OPERATE.
families had recently established a col
ony and gone to farming, taking up
and dividing a l^rge area of land that
for years had been devoted to grain
raising. The Promotion Committee's
work is bringing many people to the
valley, Mr. McNear said, and the large
land tracts are gradually being cut up
into small farms. He, too, contributed
his mite of advocacy to the co-opera
tion plan.
Fred J. Koster spoke of the Intelli
gent and indefatigable work of the
Promotion Committee's executive staff,
and predicted still richer returns from
It as" its usefulness Increases with age
and experience. ; ;â¢'.. ; :
This exhausted the programme, and
President Sbarboro thanked the gentle
men present for their attendance, their
arguments and their attention. "riv^

"Sacramento, Nov. 17, 1903. Rufus P.
Jennings, executive officer â¢ California
Promotion Committeeâ My Dear Sir:
Answering your telegram of yesterday,
I find that It will.be. much to my re
gret, impractlcablevfor me to be pres
ent with you to-day. I, need not say
to you 'that I believe your committee
has done, ijp doing and will do good
work in, the building up of the State of
California. The results you 1 ? have al
ready accomplished remove any doubt
as to that; and ' the. earnestness of
your efforts .has established you ! in
the confidence of those who have
watched your course.
"There is no good reason why. the
State of California, north and | south,
should not advance with giant strides.
Our climate, our soil and all, that* God
has given us proclaim our ! State the
peer of. any land on earth. ,. And , all
that is needed to bring, millions here
where only tens of thousands now; re
side is to make our material advant
ages known to all men. Your commit
tee, it seems to me, is doing and . has
done Just what Northern California
long has needed.
"I hope that you will continue In
your good work.
"Very truly yours,
"GEORGE C. PARDEE." x
At the conclusion of the secretary's
remarks the following letter from Gov
ernor Pardee was read: ,
FROM THE GOVERNOR.
"The Boards of Trade and improve
ment clubs throughout California have
done and are doing great work for their
several sections. New organizations
have been formed during the past year,
and an increased activity and desire to
do things are evident all about us. The
committee Is highly complimented at
the spirit displayed by all of these or
ganizations. They ke"ep our headquar
ters supplied with good literature and
in many ways are of great assistance.
The committee on its side is constantly
referring inoulrers to sections of the
State they may be interested in and
the results of this method of operation
show more effectively all the time.
"The co-operation from the business
and professional men of San" Francisco
is of a very substantial kind. Money,
that powerful factor, has been con
stantly with us and mode it possible to
carry on the work. This work has de
veloped and requires still more money
which will be forthcoming. San Fran
ciscans take a deep interest because
they. realize that in upbuilding our
State we upbuild our city."
"The railroads are -Â± great factor in
the development of our State. The
committee has been in close and con
stant touch with all of the railroads In
terested in California and from their
officers received much advice of value
and hearty co-operation at all times.
USEFUL FACTORS
"The object of this meeting is to ob
tain advice from the members with
different interests and with diverse
views. Brief mention, however, of a
few things that are now being done in
the way of co-operation will not, I take
it, be out of place here.
"First and foremost, it has been rec
ognized by the committee that the
greatest assistance to Its work of State
development would come from the
press. This opinion has been Justified
and the press of California is co-oper
ating most heartily. To cement still
closer the relationship between this
committee and the California press
there is being established the Califor
nia Publication Bureau. This bureau
Invites all California publications to be
represented and many Eastern publica
tions will be on the list ,of associate
members. The California Publication
Bureau will be chiefly for the purpose
of exchanging articles and news items
so that different sections of the State
will become better acquainted, ami so
that people in the East will read re
prints from California papers.

by continuing along the lines adopted
the "knocks*^ in California will soon
be hard to find, and the fact that he
ever existed forgotten.
"We appreciate the work of counties
and clubs, of Boards of Trade and
Chambers of Commerce and women's
clubs. We are glad to have the mes
sage we have been preaching for so
long taken up by so many voices. The
"It is not out of place to remand you
that the Southern'PacIflc has long been
in the field. We are in the business of
promotion as a matter of necessity.
The interests of a great railroad and a
great State are mutual interests. One
wants traffic, the other wants popula
tion. One seeks passengers and freight,
the other the occupation of "Its lands
and the development of its resources.
A railroad therefore serves the State,
its policy is far-sighted, its plans
broad and . far-reaching, when to the
superficial-minded it seems but to serve
its own interests.
State Mineralogist Lewis E. Aubury
suggested that in the printed matter
for distribution among possible in
vestors the same be in as condensed
form as possible. He suggested, also,
that accurate maps of the various
counties be incorporated in the publi
cations; also the railroad systems; the
population of each county, according
to the last census, its assessed valua
tion, the various minerals found in the
county, with the yearly production of
the same, and naming particularly the
leading mineral products of each coun
ty. He advised the Promotion Com
mittee to issue a relief map , of the
State, depicting the county boundaries,
county seats, railroads, streams, moun
tain ranges, etc., accompanied by a
sketch map of the State, on which
could be shown the approximate loca
tion of the various mineral deposits,
and pointed out j that articles con
tributed from time to time on special
subjects covering the mining industry
in California would have a most bene
ficial effect.
James Hosburgh Jr., acting.for E. O.
McCormick of the Southern Pacific,
had this to say:
up first, but to fill them all. This, gen
tlemen, Is mv idea of co-operation."
THE MINING INDUSTRY.
Sergeant Helms, who has charge of
the local team, submitted to Chief
Wittman yesterday the names of the
Kix men making the highest scores at
the Harbor View range. The total rep
resents ten scores of ten shots each and
the average is 72 4-6. The lucky six
are W. R. Proll. 794; Smith Carr. 771;
F. W. French, 717. * J. E. Dolan. 705;
W. W. "Wilson, â¬30; Harry Hook, 665.
The alternates are R. P. de Guire, 624,
and W. H. Burkholder, 623. The losing
team will present a silver cup to the
winners.
For the last two weeks the /crack re

Secretary Jennings then explained
the purposes of the advisory- board of
the promotion committee, under' whose
auspices the co-operative movement
had its inception. He said:
"So sure as water seeks Us level will
California eventually fill up with mil
lions of people from less favored parts
of the world. The question Is whether
we shall let that event come slowly by
itself or by assisting it with such work
as we are doing, to fill up the State in
a comparatively short period of time."
CO-OPERATION THE WORD.
"This promotion committee generous
ly maintained by the enterprising men
and well wishers of our State, while it
has not as yet been in existence two
years, has done a remarkable . amount
of good. It has disseminated the true
facts of our capabilities throughout
the world. To-day millions and mil
lions of people are reading about our
country In all parts of the world.
"At a recent meeting our Â«:ommittee
lias added to its strength a number of
representative citizens as an advisory
committee. From you gentlemen here
assembled the committee expects to be
informed of your wants in the different
sections of the State and with the gen
erous contributions of our members we
are In hopes of being able to assist you
materially.
"Our State is larger than the King
dom of Italy, which sustains 35,000.000
Inhabitants. Our climate and soil, our
ocean frontage, and in fact, the topog
raphy even of our State is greatly sim
ilar to that of Italy. We can therefore
raise everything which is produced in
that sunny land and we have in addi
tion a great many industries, such as
mineral wealth, oil and an abundance
of water, when properly developed, for
Irrigating our lands and furnishing mo
tive power for our manufacturers.
President Sbarboro occupied the
chair, and the object of the gathering
was pretty clearly set forth in his open
ing address. He said:
"Gentlemen: We have met here to
day for the purpose of co-operating in
the development of the inexhaustible
resources of our great State.
PROMOTION WORK.
In addition to the valuable talks con
tributed by the foregoing gentlemen,
the meeting was treated to ringing
messages of encouragement from Gov
ernor Pardee, General Will S. Green,
president of the Sacramento Valley De
velopment Association, and James S.
Barr of Stockton, who had been invited
to speak in behalf of the San Joaquin
Valley Commercial Association.
To the suggested co-operation of all
the movements aiming at California's
material betterment not one opposing
word was heard. Each speaker ad
vanced logical argument in support of
the proposed "all for one and one for
all" policy, and in the course of the
proceedings that personified detriment
to the communal good, the "knocker,"
was severely dealt with. His sectional
narrowness was unanimously pro
nounced one of the worst handicaps
the State as a whole has to contend
with in Its effort to move forward, and
his suppression was advised without
equivocation or stint. It was the State
of California, and not any section of
it, that the meeting stood for and the
orators advocated.
RINGING MESSAGES.
Among those who had something to
say and said it well were A. Sbarboro,
president of the California Promotion
Committee; Rufus P. Jennings, the
ever-busy secretary of the same asso
ciation; W. R. Alburger, representing
the Atchison. Topeka and Santa Fe
Railroad; Lewis E. Aubury, speaking
for the California State Mining Bureau;
James Hoesburgh Jr., acting for the
passenger department of the Southern
Pacific Railroad; R. P. Lathrop of Hol
lister, delegated by the California Cen
tral Coast Counties Improvement Club;

J. Koster of the executive staff of the
Promotion Committee.
cussion yesterday afternoon at
the headquarters of the State Promotion
Committee, on New Montgomery street.
The Interest of the theme was en
hanced by the prominence and intelli
gence of the men that participated in
the Interchange of views. They includ
ed representatives of all the agencies
that are most active in the upbuilding
of the commonwealth. Each of the rail
road systems had a spokesman pres
ent, and there were emissaries qualified
to voice the opinions of the various or
ganizations that are laboring to .ad
vance the well being of their respective
sections. It was one of^ the most in
structive meetings ever* held for the
purpose of devising ways and means
to accelerate California's general pro
gress.
CO-OPERATION in the develop
ment of California's material
resources was the dominant
note of a very interesting dis-
George W. McNear told of the rapidity 1
with which the waste places of the San

"We are all in favor of co-operation
in this matter of- promoting Califor
nia's interests. We know that the
gain of one section of the State is the
gain of all."
FILLING WASTE PLACES.
C. P. Soule, representing the North
Coast counties, told of the work that is
being done by the Eureka Chamber of
Commerce to induce immigration to
the great redwood region. He said: .
"It Is astonishing how many people
In California know so little about our
part of the State. I have met folks who
have lived here/all their lives and are
presumed to be ordinarily informed on
matters concerning the geography of
their native State, and I have found
them laboring under the delusion that
Eureka is In Oregon. Our lack of rail
road communication may be responsi
ble for this extraordinary ignorance,
and we have hopes that the long-felt
want will soon be filled. With the
Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe
making eyes at each other, we may
soon have you gentlemen come to visit
us in Pullman sleepers.
"As you may know, we are in the
heart of the redwood region, but lum
bering is not our only important indus
try- We have dairies and we have
fruit, and all. we want is railroad fa
cilities to transport our products to
market.- But despite our so-called re
moteness our section is steadily grow
ing in wealth and- population. The Eu
reka Chamber of Commerce ha,s done
much to advertise our resources and
bring in desirable settlers. I have heard
that within the last thirty months the
population of San Francisco has in
creased at the ratio of 25 per cent.
Well, the same can truthfully be said
of Humboldt County. The people are
preceding the railroads, and. as a mat
ter of course, where the people are the
railroads will follow. . '.
"I think some of the suggestions of
Mr. Aubury as well as Mr. Lathrop's
should be acted upon. The principal
thing Is to get in harmony and not to
express ourselves against any locality,
and if we have nothing good to say
of a place, say nothing."
R. X. Ryan, representing the Cali
fornia Northwestern Railway, said:
"We believe this committee is a ne
cessity for California's growth, and
anything that this committee d<5es
must receive our commendation. Our
railroad is ever ready to help your
committee, because by helping It we
are helping ourselves."

Progress of State Is
Watchword of
Meeting.
Shortly before Christmas of last year
pretty Florence . Russell of this city
crossed the Pacific to Manila in re
sponse to a summons from Charles Je
rome de Witt, an employe of the quar
termaster's department of the United
States army, who had won her consent
to become his wife a few months before.
That was a trip destined to bring her
the great sorrow of her life. Accord-
Ing to a divorce complaint filed by her
yesterday within a month after she
reached the Orient she found herself
almost an outcastâ the dupe of the maa
she had loved and trusted.
Mrs. de Witt sues for severance of
the marital ties on the ground that her
husband was convicted of a felony.
She alleges in the complaint that he was
sentenced to serve a term of ten years
In prison.
According to the complaint she was
married to De Witt In the city of Ma
nila on January 3, 1903. On the 9th of
the following month he was adjudged
guilty of felony embezzlement, his crime
having been discovered within a few
days after she became his wife.
Mary B. Arnold is suing Francis P.
Arnold for divorce on the ground of
desertion. Neglect Is charged in the
complaint filed by Trinlta C. Brewer
against W. W. Brewer.
Interlocutory decrees of divorce were
granted to Bertram M. Pratt from Alice
Pratt for desertion, Fannie Blackman
from Harry Blackman for cruelty, and
Kate Sophia Teresa Varney from F.
H. Varney for desertion.
The explanation did not satisfy
Judge Troutt and he, informed Cousins
that he intended to keep in touch with
the office of Mr. Hanlon and that just
as soon as the latter returned from his
much talked of long journey he would
summon him into his presence and
learn, if he could. Just what was done
with the papers. In speaking of the
matter, Judge Troutt said:
Â¦ I am Inclined to think that some one
exceeded his authority in taking: those*
papers from the County dork's office.
It is true that I made a court order per
mitting their removal, but that order was
made on the 7th inst. and was intended
only to apply to that particular time, or
until such time as the case came up for
adjudication. The case was heard on
the 3th and decided immediately and the
order then became void. If the papers
were taken out of the custody of the
clerk after noon of the 9th, the hour the
case was decided, then the persons who
took them were to blame. I do not know
of any agreement by which it was under
stood that the papers were to be kept for
a year.
William Cou6ins, the I\andy man of
Attorney Charles Hanlon, who so suc
cessfully handled the court proceedings
In connection with the now famous
Whittell-Boyere case, was summoned
by Judge Troutt yesterday to appear
before him In chambers and explain
the mystery surrounding the disappear
ance of the papers In the case. Not
withstanding the fact that Cousins has
been accused by more than one per
6on of being the last person to have
handled the papers after the court pro

"Piano paralysis" is often brought on
by continued straining of the muscles
before they have had time to gradally
acquire the strength necessary to with
stand the demands made on them, and
more than one musical genius has had
his career nipped in the bud by Just
this very thing.
It may seem that I am overexplicit
in my directions and overparticular in
having them carried out. but, believe
me, it is absolutely necessary to go over
and over these little details as vie pro
gress from step to step until the whole
thing becomes second nature to the
child, and he relaxes without being
told, assumes the proper positions nat
urally and gracefully and, above all,
brings out a beautiful tone from the
piano.
In practicing this last finger exercise,
let the pupil raise and lower the first
and second fingers, counting "one, two,
three four, five, six" â "one, two, three,
four, five, six" as one continuous ex
ercise, relaxing between the count "six"
in the first group and "one" in the sec
ond (the finger upraised meanwhile un
til the count "one," when it drops and
the other one rises). Be sure that the
whole thing is rhythmic and not Jerky
and uneven. Let him do this six times
slowly, with the first pair of fingers,
then go on to the second and third fin
ger, third and fourth, and finally fourth
and fifth, trying each six times in turn.
When exercising the fourth finger,
both in connection with the third and
the fifth, he will find even more diffi
culty in raising it to the proper level
than he did in the single exercise for
the fingers given In lesson 2. It will
all come right by practice, however,
and the principal thing to guard
agai~st in the matter is the turning of
the hand. Do not let him attempt to
raise the fourth finger very high, if it
strains it at all. for it is better to go
somewhat Elowly than to risk injuring
the little hands.

For Colombia to demand that we prevent the secession
of Panama is to ask a vain thing, for which there is no
basis in fact. Panama has repeatedly been independent and has
as repeatedly remerged in the government of the continen
tal territory now called Colombia. It is useless for Colom
bia to remind us of our opposition to domestic secession.
The case of Panama is entirely different. Its analogy is
found in the case of Cuba. That island is near our shores;
the tranquillity of its people concerned our commerce and
touched our interests in a variety of ways. It was in con
stant uproar and revolution. While we had no treaty obli
gation to justify us. we had the general obligation to hu
manity and the world, which Europe has been reminded of
in the case of Turkey and Macedonia. In pursuance thereof
we demanded that Spain recognize the independence of
Cuba, and upon her refusal to do so we occupied the isl
and, and after tranquillizing it gave it over to its own peo
ple to govern.
We are under precisely the same general obligation as
to Panama, and added tc it is our treaty responsibility to
preserve the peaceful transit and neutrality of the isthmus.
We suppose that Colombia will hardly pretend that the
constant condition of revolution in Panama is the protest
of the isthmians against good government, justice and en
forcement of tKeir rights!
In his protest to Great Britain Marroquin accuses the
United States- of "fomenting the separatist spirit, of which
there is abundant evidence." That 1 is refrigerated diplo
macy, in view of all the facts. Our readers will remember
that in August last, when Panama was hoping that the Bo
gota Government would keep faith with the United States
by ratifying the Hay-Herran canal treaty, the military com
andante at Panama, a minion of Bogota, at midnight ar
rested and deposed the civil Governor, an isthmian, and sub
verted the civij government of the state. Next day he of
fered the governorship to the United States Consul, and then
it developed that he was on a drunk and was making sixes
and sevens of the affairs of Panama. For this act he was
not punished by the central government. Again, and bear
ing on the charge that we promoted the' separatist spirit,
when Obaldia pleaded for Panama that the canal treaty be
ratified, he said if that. were done "I am a Colombian; if it
be not done I am a Panamah."
The separatist spirit was promoted by Bogota and not
by Washington. If Colombia suffer it is her fault, and is the
punishment due to bad faith and misgbvernment. Mar
roquin confesses that in the recent past the United States
gave Bogota a chance to tranquillize the isthmus by land
ing bluejackets and policing the railroad in the revolution
that ended last year. That being done, it was his business
m r ARROQUIN and Jarmmillo have sent a protest to
\\l\ the Senate pleading the obligation of the United
X T 1. States 'to maintain Colombian sovereignty on the
isthmus of Panama. We have shown by article 35 of the
treaty of 1846 that if such be our obligation it runs to the
defunct state of New Granada, which was overthrown by a
revolutionary congress. The only fair interpretation of the
treaty is that we will uphold local sovereignty over the isth
mus, and will not assume it ourselves nor permit its aliena
tion to any European power.
THE COLOMBIAN PROTEST.
When the United States of Colombia asked Germany to
assume a protectorate over her she should have been brought
before the bar of nations on the ground of impugning the in

they would run would not be satisfac

advantage of the poor people of these
islands, who comprise fully 90 per cent
of the inhabitants.

to do all the work there is to do. If the

IT is * reported that the military superintendent of
Yosemite Park recommends that the Government take
immediate possession of all patented lands in the park
and in the forest reserves. Without the full text of the re
port before us this language must be taken in its plain in
tent. ,
Within the parks and reserves there are extensive pri
vate holdings, paid for and patented long before the reser
vations were made. The owners of these properties, and
they include timber and mineral lands and valuable riparian
rights, are now practically forbidden their use, which is bad
enough, but to take immediate possession' of them is worse,
if it were possible that such summary spoliation can be in
dulged in under the constitutional declaration that no citi
zen can be deprived of life, liberty ojr property without due
process of law.
It is quite easy to make the reservation policy so
oppressive as to blind the judgment of men to its vast bene
fits. Within the reservations in this State are located some
of the best of our hydraulic powers. They are usually in
private ownership, antedating by many years the creation of
the reservation. They were not of great importance until
the modern application of electricity. Now, they are im
portant to the economics of considerable sections of the
State. In many extensive mineral districts the operation of
mines is impossible without the use of power from such
sources.
To the ordinary mind no reason appears why such prop
erties, already long patented and in private ownership,
should not be used, under proper Government regulation,
to provide that such use shall not interfere with the object
of park reservations, which is to preserve impressive natural
scenery, or of the forest reservations, which is to preserve
the forests to conserve moisture, but permit the harvest of.
their r'pe timber.
This State is favorable and friendly to all these reserves,
but our people will oppose the summary and* immediate
seizure of private property recommended by the military
superintendent. The report also deals with the jurisdiction
of the Yosemite Valley. The park of the same name is com
monly confused and confounded with the valley. The val
ley is inclosed by the park, but it is administered by the
State as a trust conferred by Congress.
If the reports from the mountains last summer were true
there is danger in divided jurisdiction, for it was said that
when the most destructive fire that ever visited the vicinity
of the valley was raging the State superintendent of the val
ley and the military superintendent of the park stood for
days disputing whether the fire was on Federal or State
territory, until it gained such headway that their combined
forces could not master it until it had destroyed the fine
forest extending from the Wawona road to Glacier Point.

Since the organization of the Miners' Association there
has developed a more thorough method and a disposition
to patiently attack the harder problems of mining. By all
means let us kill the wildcats, put an end to swindling
schemes, dignify mining by protecting those who .invest in
it, and surrounding it with all the certainties that mechanics
and chemistry afford, and then let us go further and do
here ourselves and for ourselves all that needs to be done
in the economic reduction of every form. of combination in
which the precious metals and useful minerals are found.
PRESIDENT BELSHAW of the Miners' Association
in his annual address laid proper stress upon the
necessity of hunting down wildcat mining schemes,
by which distant investors, are swindled and a bad name is
extended to legitimate mining. The day has gone by when
mining is all chance. The progress made in the mechanical
and chemical features of mining has made it almost un
necessary to take the great risks that were formerly as
sumed by investors in deposits of the precious metals."
This progress has been promoted by the founding of
schools in mining and metallurgy. Science has come to the
aid of the miner, and nearly all of the former uncertainty in
the industry is canceled. In this State there already exists
a valuable safeguard against wildcat mining, in the State
Mining Bureau, which has its official headquarters and its
vast and valuable museum exhibit in the ferry building. If it
were more widely advertised and known that such an official
body exists, under the laws of California, Eastern people
and foreigners would more generally resort to it for infor-.
mation about the reality of mining. schemes that are put on
the market at a distance, l^;
The building of the isthmian canal will give an impulse
to California mining, because many of our valuable refrac
tory ores have to be sent to Swansea, the metallurgical cen
ter of the world, for reduction. But the Miners' Associa
tion may well inquire why there is not a strong school oi
mines in this State, and why the United States, the great
est mining country in the world, must export its refractory
ores to Wales for reduction, t
The proposition to have a Federal Department of Mines,
with a Cabinet officer at its head, and to include every class
of mining in its jurisdiction, may be an important step
toward the promotion of metallurgy by the creation of the
facilities here which arc now found only in Swansea. The
possibility of an all-water line from this coast to Swansea
will enable the sending of much more ore to that center for
extraction of its values, but it should not deter American min
ing enterprise from seeking to have that extraction done
at home. If the Federal Government will not undertake to
establish such an institution the State of California can well
essay its promotion. Our abundant electrical power, the
close relation of our ore bodies to the manufacturing center
of the State, on San Francisco Bay, and the desirability of
making the most of our mineral wealth, should inspire the
mining interest to move strongly for the establishment of
an American metallurgical center here.
Heretofore mining has followed, the line of least resist
ance. Beginning with the primitive processes that peopled
the placers with a swarm of hardy men, securing the treas
ure by the rudest means, with all the progress of science
we yet seek the precious metals by the easiest methods, and
have been content to leave to a foreign country the profit
of getting the most out of the most difficult ores.

that is, the position we acquired by the

click. Consequently when a pair of
lingers are moving up and down (as in
the exercise we are now studying) if
the letting go of the note by one finger
and the hitting of the next note by the
other finger be not absolutely simulta
neous, there will be two clicks heard
Instead of one, as will be the case if the
two fingers move in opposite directions
at exactly the same instant.
Not a second of time must be wasted
between the going down of one finger
and the coming up of the other. The
counting must be as slow and regular
as ever, but when th& time comes for
one finger to rise and the other to de
descend it must be done with lightning
like rapidity. This rapidity is just as
important as is the necessity for the
slow, even counting, and the relaxing
motion, between jumps, as it were.
When the' finger rises it should give a
regular "Jack-in-the-box" spring, and
its descent should be equally sudden.
If the movement of the two fingers
be not simultaneous, just so much time
is wasted and just that much weight Is
added on the wrong side of the balance
between clumsy, heavy playing and a
light, clean, clear-cut tone.
Now, we will turn our attention par

COMMISSION INTERESTED
SEATTLE. Wash., Nov. 17.â The
Alaska Packing and Navigation Company
has opened a large clam cannery in
Alaska within two miles or Wrangel, the
nrst output, consisting of 1000 cases of
clams and clam nectar, having been
placed on the market at Juneau. It is
stated that the company has received
orders for more clams than the can
nery can supply during the winter.
At tbe Federal building it was said
that a United States Senator, was im
mune from arrest on charges of the na
ture of those named In the Indictment
while Congress is in session. As a con-
fice for the benefit of the surrounding
property owners, it was suggested that
the difference in the rental be made up
by a subscription from the interested
parties.
At this Junoture the Senator was
called upon to indorse for the position
of postmaster one of the applicants,
the coit,i etition having narrowed dawn
to the Mayor, Jacob FiÂ«her, and the
editor of the Hastings Tribune, Adam
Breede. An understanding was
finally reached by which Fisher was to
receive th*> appointment of postmaster
on condition that he purchase the post
offlce fixtures belonging to the Grand
Army post at the price which It had
paid for them, and it is said Fisher also
agreed to reimburse the Senator for
the difference by which he had been
compelled to reduce the rental from his
original figure of 51500 In order to meet
the offers that had been made on be
half of a location at the other end of
the street. This difference of 5200, it Is
said, was to have been made up in
equal portions by the postmaster and
his deputy, and it is alleged that it was
paid for a few months, and then, when
the Senator discovered Its questionable
character, the money was returned to
Postmaster Fisher and Deputy Francis.
DISTBICT ATTORNEY TALKS.
The charge has been made against
District Attorney Summers that he had
not treated eome of the witnesses fair
ly, two of them. William Dutton and
Elliott Lowe, being mentioned in par
ticular. These men are said to have
asked the court for protection. Attor
ney Summers had this to say:
"I have never bullied or browbeaten
a witness In my life, either before a
grand Jury or elsewhere. I never had
a conversation with Mr. Dutton about
his testifying untir* he came to me in
person and said that he wanted to go
before the grand Jury and tell the truth
and all the truth. Mr. Lowe came to
me and said he did not know anything
about the matters that were the.sub
ject of inquiry, and I answered that,
such being the case, he probably was
subpoenaed by mistake. Mr. Lowe this
morning denied any connection with the
request for protection." .'â¢;'-
On the allegation that he was ani
mated by political differences against
Senator Dietrich, Summers said:
"I never asked him for.lndorsemenl.
As to the charge that I have brought
this matter before the grand Jury as a
means to compel the President to re
appoint me, there is absolutely nothing
in it. This investigation's made be
cause I believe it my duty as an officer
and for no other purpose whatever."
Postmaster Fisher to-day appeared In
Judge Munger*s court, gave a bond for
$1000 for his appearance later, and was
released.
The programme for Friday afternoon

WASHINGTON. Nov. 17.â Senator
Dietrich said to-day of his indictment
it Omaha on the charge of conspiracy

pointment of Jacob Fisher as postmas
t- r at Hastings, Nebr.:
.There is absolutely nothing to have

received a dollar or any property from
Mr. Fisher or any other person in ex
change for my influence. I have some
bitter enemies. As Governor, I re
fused to pardon Joe Bartley, the de
faulting ex-State Treasurer. I have it
from reliable authority that Mr. Sum
ixfjr-s, the present United States Dis
trict Attorney, is largely responsible
for securing the pardon of Bartley. It
Las been intimated to me for a long
time that Summers would make me
trouble if I did not cease my endeavor
to have him ousted from his present po
Â¦ttton. 1 do not know, of course, the
testimony given to secure my indict
ment. It must have been absolutely
false or I would not have been in
dicted."
Senator Dietrich, accompanied by
Senator Hanna and Editor Rosewater
of .the Omaha Bee, called upon Attor
ney General Knox to-<3ay for a confer
ence. The Senator said he intended to
go to Nebraska to stand trial, but felt
that his case would te prejudiced if
District Attorney Summers has charge
Â£>t the prosecution. As a result of the
talk with. the Attorney General the lat
ter will have a consultation with the
President about the case, and it is
probable that Summers will be relieved
from the conduct of the Dietrich case
ur.d that Assistant District Attorney
Hush of Nebraska or some attorney

the Attorney General.
FISHERS FRIENDS EXPLAIN.
OMAHA; Nebr., Nov. 17.â The indict
. meet of United States Senator Charles
â¢ H. Dietrich and Postmaster Jacob
Fisher of Hastings, Nebr., on charges
*)f bribery and conspiracy in connection
with the appointment of the latter as
postmaster, was a Fubject of extreme â¢
â¢.interest in Omaha to-day. At the Fed
eral b.uilding email groups of Govern- i
ment officials, employes and others j
- gathered to discuss the subject.
The details of the postmastership
transaction in Hastings, as given out j
trr-day by Fisher's friends, are as fol
lows:
The poFtoffice in Hastings, up to two i
years a^o, was located in a building â¢
erected by the local post of the Grand i
Azmy of the Republic. Previous to in- !
FtaiJarion in this building the postof- i
fue had been in other quarters and Â¦
Kucressive postmasters had provided
the fixtures themselves. The Grand i
â¢ Army bought the fixtures for 5500 and
their use was included in the Govern- |
rent lease.
â¢ About three years ago considerable I
effort was made to procure better ac- j
â¬Â¦< rr.modations for the postofflce busi- !
ress, the contention becoming one be- ;
tv.pen the opposite ends of town. Sen- :
at'or Deitrich, w-*io had then Just been
elected Governor, had put up a new Â¦
buildinp near the Grand Army building J
end, anticipating the removal of the.
T'ostoffice, took up the subject with the !
r r >stoffiee authorities during a visit to j
Washington. A lease was agreed upon, ;
subject to more specific terms, but the j
rest)tiations were not concluded until
after Governor Deitrich had been elect- |
ed United States Senator. In the mean
time property owners interested in the j
other section of the city made counter!
bffers at reduced rentals, and, in order !
to hold the postoffice in the vicinity of j
Peitrich's property a lease was finally j
drawn and signed at a rental of 51300, ;
omitting the requirement of the owner
to supply the fixtures.

his property for less than it was worth j

Only forty-three American clerks are
employed in United States consular of
fices. The salaries are so small that
only foreigners will take the places. To
underpaid foreign clerks, who are anx
ious to piece out their incomes, Pierce
says, much of the inefficiency of the
American consular service and many
of the charges of dishonesty are duÂ«Â».
He urges the j employment of only
Americans as Cpnsuls, vice-consuls
and clerks, and suggests that native
born Americans are much more satis
factory than men of foreign birth, who
are naturalized In the United States
and sent back to the land of their na
tivity for service.
Under the present system a fee for
certifying an invoice is $2 50. It mat
ters not whether the invoice is for $100
or $100,000 worth of goods." No charge
is made for certifying an invoice of less
than 5100, and no maximum limit is set
as to the amount which may be placed
on an invoice. In consequence large
shipments of goods are frequently list
ed in invoices of less than $100 and
scores of distinct invoices are often
combined in one to avoid the payment
of more than one fee.
Thomas W. Peters, United States
Consul at Plauen, Germany, reported
one case to Pierce, in which a promi
nent American merchant had combined
105 distinct invoices in one. Many cases
have been listed on separate invoices.
Pierce recommends a complete revi
sion of the method of certifying in
voices. He would have certificates of
every invoice worth more than 525 and
would not permit any invoice to exceed
5100.000. He would have a minimum fee
of 25 c*>nts and a maximum fee of 550.
The increased income of consular agen
cies under this system would make it
possible to employ additional expert
help, which would, in Pierce's opinion,
bring about an increase of at least
5100,000 a year in the Government's re
ceipts.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â Frauds
in the declarations of goods exported
to the United States, which cost the
United States 51,000,000 a year, are laid
bare in the report of Third Assistant
Secretary Pierce on the American con
sular service in Europe.
These frauds are made possible by
faulty methods of certifying invoices,
and, according to Pierce's report, are
the direct result of a short-sighted pol
icy in the payment of the Consuls. and
Consular Agents and clerks. Exporters
are taking advantage of the United
States at practically all ports wher.e
goods are exported to the United States
upon which ad valorem duties are col
lected. Shrewd merchants are especial
ly active at French and German ports,
where the exportations to American de
partment stores swell the volume of
business and make it impossible for the
overworked officials to go through the
invoices with care. The expense ac
counts of Consuls are shaved so closely
that they are unable to employ agents
who are expert in judging expensive
wares shipped to the United States.
Valuable laces and other finery pass
through the hands of inexperienced in
spectors and escape their share of tax
ation.
PARIS, Nov. 17.â Edwin Lord Weeks,
the American painter, died Monday
evening at his residence. 12 Rue Leon
ard de Vince. He had been ill about
two nionths, but was not thought to be
in danger. He had a complication of
ills resulting from fevers contracted
several years ago in India, where he
had passed much time studying Ori
ental subjects for painting.
"Weeks was about 55 years old. He
was a member of the Society of Ameri
can Painters in Paris, his colleagues
being Bishpam Brldgman, Melchior S.
Gay, Dannat and Vail. He was a pupil
of Bonnat during his early days when
he studied, in "Paris at. the same time
with Pearce, Blashfleld and Beckwith.
He was famous for pictures of life in
Oriental countries. On Monday he told
his wife he wanted to go into his stu
dio, where the sight of his pictures and
other familiar objects, it was thought,
would encourage him and give him
more strength, but after reaching the
studio he was obliged to lie on a couch,
where he remained until hfe died.
Weeks was born in Boston in 1849
and went as a youth to Paris, where he
entered Ecole des Beaux Arts. While
pursuing his studies there he frequent
ly visited the studios of Bonnat and
Gerome and acquired his love of Ori
ental subjects, decoration and- art from
his former master.
He afterward returned to Boston and
there lived for some years, making oc
casional journeys to Egypt, the Holy
Land and Morocco. He exhibited at
the salon and at displays of the Paris
Societe des Amis des Arts and received
many honors. At the salon of 1SS5 he
received honorable mention and at the
salon of 1889 he was medaled. He was
also, medaled at the exposition of 1889.
The artist found his subjects for the
most part in the Orient and has been
well called "the American Gerome."
He loved to depict the architecture,
interiors, costumes and street and
home life of the Arabs and Moors, as
well as the wild life of the same people
in the desert. He was a strong
draughtsman, a master of composition
and a good colorist. His pictures are
truthful, pleasing and strong.

"We soon learned that Postum does
not exhilaYate or depress and does not
stimulate, but steadily and t honestly
strengthens the nerves and the stom-
ach. To make a long story short, our
entire family have now used Postum
for eight years with completely satis-
fying results as shown in our fine con-
dition of health, and we have noticed
a rather unexpected improvement in
brain and nerve power." Name given
>fcy Postum Co., Battle Creek. Mich.
Increased brain and nerve power al-
ways follow the use of Postum in place
of coffee, sometimes in a very marked
manner.
"My husband had been drinking cof-
fee all his life until it had affected his
nerves terribly. I persuaded him to
shift to Postum and it was easy to get
him to make the change, for the Pos-
tum is so delicious. It certainly work-
cd wonders for him.
She says: "At the time Postum was
first put on the market I was suffering
from nervous dyspepsia and my physi-
cian had repeatedly told me not to use
tea or coffee. Finally I decided to take
his advice and try Postum and got a
pample and had it carefully prepared,
finding it delicious to the taste. So I
continued its use and very soon its
beneficial effects convinced me of its

SAN DIEGO, Nov. 17.â Dr. AlphonsÂ«

TACOMA. Wash., Nov. 17.â Martin
Voorhies, treasurer of the Kapowsin
Lumber Company and a prominent lum

a native of Detroit.
and a Darty of friends.
Lou M. Houseman, sporting editor of
the Chicago Inter Ocean and one of the
best known authorities in America on
boxing, gives this estimate of Canole:
"Far Eastern critics are unanimous
in pronouncing .Canole one of the best
boxers in the lightweight division turn
ed out in that section, of the country
for many years. His record includes
defeats of Martin Flaherty and Dan
ny Duane when those boys were at
their best, besides many minor victo
ries.
"In none of his battles has Canole
been compelled to extend himself, win
ning every engagement with compara
tive ease. His most notable achieve
ment was the defeat of Jack O'Keefe
the cleverest pugilist of his weight in
Chicago. As O'Keefe holds a decision
over Britt and a draw with him to his
credit, Canole, if he lives up to his
Eastern reputation, should manage to
carry off the big end of the purse when
he faces the crack Californian.
"It is also worthy of notice. that Ca
nole, like his prospective opponent, is
one of the few. light weights now be
fore the public who can reach the true
weight limit for that classâ 133 pounds
ringsideâ and do himself . Justice He
uses a clean, straight left when In ac
tion that is very effective In checking
a rush and scores up points with be
wildering-rapidity. At the same time
he is not devoid of punching ability and
cairies a knock-out -blow in the right
glove that should bring him the money
if he gets It across to Brltt's jaw. The
coast lad has no easy task before him.
If he whips Canole decisively he 'will
have earned the right to be considered
the best white light weight in the
countyâ in fact in the worldâ as none of
the foreign boxers are worthy of being
placed on a level with our ring artists."

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 17.
â The varsity diamond was the center
of attraction for the college community
last night when the students turned out
en masse in a rally in honor of the
varsity eleven. All afternoon the fresh
men were busy carrying wood for a
huge bonfire that last night served the
double purpose of furnishing light for
the rally and of tempering to a certain
degree the coldness of the night air.
Despite the freezing temperature al
most the entire student body appeared
on the bleachers to cheer the cardinal
eleven. Speeches were made by Captain
Bansbach and other members of the
team and by Trainer "Dad" Moulton
and faculty representatives. The spirit
of the meeting on the bleachers was
one of jollification, which included a
satisfied feeling that Stanford had
made the better showing in the game
on Saturday. The only regret the var
sity players could express was that the
field had not been perfectly dry in order
that the merits of the two teams could
have been properly tested and the
Stanford backs given an opportunity to
show to the best advantage.
Trainer "Dad" Moufcton has an
nounced that on Saturday will occur
the first track meet or the season on
the Stanford oval. A large number of
varsity track candidates have ap
peared on the cinder path for training
this fall and it is as a preliminary test
of the qualities of some of the new men
that the meet will be held.
Interesting Rally Is Held in Honor
of the Men Who Sported

games of the season this afternoon, but

noon In a close, featureless game.
Score: Los Angeles, 4; Portland, 3-

Angeles bunched hits off Shields In the
fourth inning and scored three runs.
Umpire McDonald Is still ill and Buck

The Cripples should have been fined
and imprisoned for losing the game
yesterday to Seattle on the Oakland
baseball field. In nearly every inning
they had chances to get runs, but they
passed them up and the best they got
was three, while the northern tossers
were there with four.
Cold weather and a rugged field made
good baseball a thing not to be thought
of* and also affected the players so
much that many of them seemed to
forget such a thing as a ball game was
on the boards. The few brilliant plays
that did happen received scant atten
tion, as the fans were not looking for
them and therefore did not care what
happened.
The Cripples had men on the bases In
nearly every Inning; but in only one
round vdid they show any kind of rally
ing form. That was during the pro
gress of the eighth. Then Brick Dev
ereaux brought in two with his third
double for the afternoon: There were
still two on the bags when Moskiman
came up and also two down. The best
the Doc had was a high fly to Brashear
and that gained nothing for Peter.
The northern stars generally made
runs when they needed them. They be
gan In the first by getting one. In the
fourth they increased it to three, and
to round out the contest they pulled an
other through in the sixth. Just enough
to win the game.
Devereaux met the ball for a fare-ye
well, landing for three doubles and a
single. Young Jansing furnished the
fielding sensation in the seventh inning
when Murdock lined a fast one over
the lad's head. He made a leap into the
air and corraled the sphere with one
mitt and then doubled Rockenfleld at
first. The score:

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
The Bakersfield veteran started to
close in hard in the fourth, but Cordell
kept the Mexican off and developed
some rapid lefts. As the round closed
a vicious right swing from" Herrera
was lost in Cordell's blocking.
The fifth round rang on to a quick
rally, in which Cordell rushed and
landed four or five jabs, â¢ jolting and
staggering Herrera. The Mexican
tried his swings, but failed to land and
Cordell kept up a steady left jab,
twice uppercutting heavily on the
mouth and hurting Herrera with a
strong right and left.- jolt to the head.
This was Cordell's round strong.
They fought hard in the sixth and
Aurelia seemed worried after missing
a couple of rights and receiving hard
rights on the jaw. Herrera grazed
Cordell with a right and at the bell
they were in a clinch. In. the seventh
and eighth rounds Cordell repeatedly
blocked his man and landed well. The
valley lad took a hard right. and left
on the head, but the blows did not stop
him. As the eighth ended Cordell was
driving Herrera around the ring.
Rounds nine, ten and eleven were
Cordell's without a question. They
fought with vigor and Cordell's left
gave Herrera trouble When it caught
him on the face. Cqrdell slipped and
went down in tlfe twelfth, but was up
and at Herrera, who was wild, with
both hands. Cordell jabbed him In the
face, but . did not have steam
enough to land a knockout
blow. The thirteenth was Cordell's.
In the fourteenth: the pair went at
it hammer and tongs from the Jump.
They smashed away with both arms
going. Cordell landed one heavy. right
on Herrera's head only to go down on
a return swing that did not hurt him
any, for he was up in a couple of sec
onds and, continued the gamey contest.
It was -a heartwarmer through the fif
teenth and last round.* Herrera caught
Cordell with a hot one to (he jaw that
sent the boy to the floor. He stayed
six seconds and after getting to his
feet rallied and drove Kerrera to the
ropes. They clinched and were parted.
Herrera sailed in again like a fiend. 1
Cordell was clinching for a few seconds
and sent back a few punches, but down
the boy went again under a stiff swing.
He was on his feet In a jiffy. Herrera's
last try missed and when the bell rang
they were both fighting stronglyâ so
strongly they, did not hear the bell.
Neither man was' damaged. ,
In 'the first preliminary George Wade
laid down to George ' Root , In the ' third
round. Wade was counted out. "Jock
ey" Bennett : failed to' show for the
scheduled go with â¢ Morite Attel. The
club substituted "Young" McConnell of
-the, Reliance Club and -Henry Lewis.
The pair, put up six rounds of red-hot
fighting that ; was .' called a . draw. Mc-
Connell is strong, but has ' yet â¢ to learn
that "roughing it" does not make a
fighter.
STAGGEES HERBERA.
In the opening round they .fought
carefully and lightly for a minute, Her
rera opening the way at once in a try
to land n swing. Cordell blocked, his
guard Ivetng perfect. The second round
began ivith Herrera's repetition of his
effort O drive in the swing. He got
In one that was so strong Cordell went
to the floor, though the blow landed on
his glove. They exchanged rights and
lefts, Cordell smiling at every rally.
The Hayes Valley boy started strongly
in the third round, leading and land
ing some stiff, straight lefts, with a
succession of jabs. Herrera tried feints
for the body, hoping to lower Cordell's
Impregnable guard, but the boy would
not be caught by the trick. Jn a mix
up things were even. It was Cordell's
round.
Cordell was first to enter the ring,
followed by Billy Otts, Tim McGrath
and "Spider" Kelly. Aurelio appeared
a few miutes later with Maura Her
rera, "Biddy" Bishop and Bobby John
son behind him.
Time and time again the tall boy
took the swing on his glove that was
always in place at the critical chin
point. In all of his blocking Cordell
displayed careful skill and went
through the fight without once losing
his head. As a boxer he clearly out
matched Herrera. As a hitter he is not
strong enough at this time to knock
out the Mexican, though Cordell had
the Bakersfield veteran in distress sev
eral times during the battle. Herrera
took many blows In an effort to get an
opening for his swing and a nasty up
percut that was smothered each time.
He fought to land that decisive punch
and the boy was too clever for him.
Cordell kept away, yet he was on hand
with straight leads that were clean and
went to the mark. He had a left jab
that was handy and bothered the older
fighter considerably.
Jack Cordell, the Hayes Valley boy,
secured the decision last night at the
Reliance Club, Oakland, over Aurelio
Herrera, in a flf teen-round boxing bout
that will stand as a landmark in the
history of fisticuffs across the bay.
To the astonishment of the men along
the line, who had made the IBakerstteld
lad a 1 to 2 favorite, young Cordell
for fourteen of the fifteen rounds
showed he could keep Herrera away,
could block the terrible rtgnt the dark
skinned southerner boasts of, could
punch and could take all the punish
ment the Mexican could hand out. In
the fifteenth round Herrera went to
work with demon-like desperation. He
hammered at the tall youth from the
valley and landed two heavy right
swings that sent Cordell plunging
groggily to the floor twice In quick suc
cession. But each time the youngster
recovered himself gamely and held on.
Both men were fighting hard amidst
a terrific uproar that drowned the
sound of the gong. The seconds fol
lowed Time Keeper George Harding
Into the ring just as Referee Eddie
Smith parted the fighters. As soon as
the ring had been cleared Smith yelled
"Cordell," and the decision was re-~
ceived with a storm of cheers from one
of the biggest crowds that ever packed
the gymnasium.
Cordell would not have been in
trouble in the last round had he not
suddenly changed his style of fighting
and rushed into Herrera as if trying
for a knockout. Throughout the fight
the valley lad kept Herrera away from
him and the Mexican did not seem to
wake up to the necessity of mixing
things until the last round. It was
early In the game that Cordell showed
he could stand off the right swing that
was his opponent's only punch.
CORDELL IS CLEVEB.

ENTREES FOB TO-DAY.
Green B. Monis was an onlooker at
the track yesterday. The veteran
trainer brought no horses with him,
but will purchase a few shifty platers
probably in this section of the coun
try.
XL J. Daly, owner of Claude and
other horses, arrived from the East
yesterday.
Tommy Butler rode three winners
one day at the meeting now in pro
gress at Latonia. and as he is here now
may take a turn In the saddle this
afternoon.
ANOTHER handful of feathers
was plucked from Harry Stov
er's Kenilworth, "the brown
bird with the sharp claws," yes
terday at Oakland racetrack.
He had "Willie See on his back again,
and as if that were not enough to ex
asperate the big horse nearly every
body liked Albula, the odds against the
latter sprinter falling: from threes to
3 to S.
It was a six-furlong handicap, to be
sure, and Kenilworth was asked to
take charge of 125 pounds, which Is quite
a care this early in the season. Albula
drew 110 pounds and, fortunately
enough besides, D. Hall. At a few of
the shopa where bargain sales were
held early purchasers obtained even
money about Kenllworth, but the pre
vailing; quotation at post time was 4
versus 6. See left the post first with
Stover's horse, but was outfooted by
St. Winlfrlde for slightly more than a
quarter of a mile. The first choice did
not appear overburdened with speed,
so Albula skinned along on the rail and
won by half a dozen lengths in 1:14*4.
Kenilworth finished second, three
lengths before St. Wlnifride. The
other two starters, Muresca and Scots
man, were not meddlesome.
TRACK IS FAST.
The track, while fast, was not at Its
best. While Arabo and San Nicholas
were the only successful favorites, the
ring did not benefit noticeably by the
wins of Eugenia B, Albula and Royal
ty, and laid away but little. The at
tendance was good.
Surprises began when Sterling Tow
ers, a 16 to 1 shot, ridden by J. Lewis, a
younger brother of the other Lewis,
took the opening eix and a half furlong
selling run. The mare made all the
running and was under three-quarter
speed from Marelio and Cherries.
Croeswaite piloted the favorite, Chi
leno, and while he undoubtedly did his
best, the little fellow has much to"
learn.
Barney Schreiber*s fllly Eugenia B
captured the flve-furlong scramble for
two-year-old fillies which followed.
Durbar, the favorite, was away from
the post poorly and had no chance, and
the Schreiber entry at 4 to 1 disposed
of the 25 to 1 shot. Targette. cleverly.
Red Cross Nurse ran third after cutting
"out the pace.
Arabo, from the stable of Walter Jen
nings, registered an easy winner of the
mile purse event. It was the first ap
pearance in several months of the big
chestnut three-year-old and, after
opening at 4 to 5, his price receded to
7 to 5. He later closed an even money
favorite. For half a mile the erratic
The Don made the running. The favor
ite then took command, scoring as he
liked from Heather Honey In 1:41%.
Schreiber's Lacy Crawford finished in
the show.
It took Old England to beat San
Nicholas when both were two-year
olds, but unfortunately San Nicholas
later on broke down. It took careful
>nursing on the part of Dan Stone to
get the black horse to a race and he
lined up one of nine starters In the
second six and a half furlong event.
With Adkins on his back, the ring laid
2 to 1 about him. and he breezed home
ahead of Rollick and Sugden.
A warm 4 to 5 favorite In Jack de
Mund was counted out In the closing
mile and a sixteenth selling number.
Sidney Bender's entry warmed up in a
rickety condition and could not raise
a gallop. In a hard drive Ferrell
landed the 6 to 1 chance Royalty first,
a length In front of Illowaho.

Cashier Donahue of the Board of
Public Works yesterday filed a flnan-'
clal statement of the expenditures for
the department during October, in
which he calls attention to the report
of Inspector Cowden relative to the
poor manner In which the streets are
being swept by Contractors J. G. Har
ney and McHugh Bros. The report
says:
The work of sweeping and cleaning
the streets for October has been de
cidedly unsatisfactory, in fact worse
than for any month of the present year.
This Is owing to the weather conditions
and to hurried work. Full schedules
were gone over, however, and
the monthly bulk shows but
slight diminution from those
of the previous month. The sec
ond-class portions of Montgomery ave
nue have caused considerable trouble
owing to rush work, and the foreman
has been notified to resweep the street
at least three times during the month.
Repeated efforts have been made to
have the sand and refuse removed from
the south side of Ellis street from
Powell street easterly next the curb of
the new Flood building, but bo far bur
efforts to have the contractor clean the
street have been unsuccessful.
The following are the expenditures of
the Department of Streets for the
month: ;n # .->
Basalt and cobble pavement, $4603 53;
cleaning and sweeping streets, $20,
750 28: corporation yard maintenance,
$471 45; reserved fund maintenance,
$217 91; cleaning Chinatown. $964 95;
general miscellaneous maintenance, $260;
salaries and wages, $2716 65; corpora
tion yard fund. $701 75; bridges, $675;
new construction work on streets and
sewers, $2252 55; street work on water
front, $24; San Bruno road work,
special. $1210 55; cleaning and repair
ing sewers. $6073 58; county roads,
$1722 07; repairs on bituminous streets,
$1985 42; repair and maintenance of
bridges, $225 42; total, 544,855 08.
The total receipts from all kinds of
permits issued by the Street Bureau
were $15. The report says:
City Engineer Grunsky filed a report
estimating the cost of putting down an
asphalt pavement on New Montgomery
street at $13,100. The City Engineer
says the Improvement is a desirable one
and recommends the use of asphalt as
the best pavement for the street, which
recommendation will be adopted by the
board. The cost of putting a basalt
pavement on Dupont street, from Cali
fornia to Sacramento, is fixed at $2600.
The board will ask the Supervisors* lor
authority to put both Improvements into
effect, the cost to be borne by the city.

A few nights later he again made his
appearance at the shelter. This time
he was accompanied by a younger
man. The two had a long conversation
with the army officers and at Its con
clusion the friend of Devillers informed
Captain Trembley that he would take
the wanderer to some hospital. Since
that time the officers at the shelter
have neither seen nor heard of the
wanderer nor his companion.
Instead of being a knight errant,
with a brilliant future before him and
numberless fair damsels weeping in his
wake, the police authorities have dis
covered that Edward Devillers is an
unfortunate wanderer, penniless and
with nothing but an unknown past and
a polished manner to recommend him.
Devillers is the owner of the mysteri
ous valise found by a boy at Bryant
street and Oak Grove avenue.
Devillers was admitted to the Alms
house on November 7. He remained a
ward of the city for several days and
finally left the place unexpectedly. He
wrote to one of the inmates to the ef
fect that he was on his way to San
Jose and from that place he intended
Journeying to Los Angeles.
Devillers is well known to members
of the Salvation Army shelter at 147
Natoma street. On November 2 he
went to the place and applied for a
room. He was under the influence of
liquor, but his dejected appearance and
refined manner. won for him the sym

The total enrollment for the last school
year was 52,906. The average dally at
tendance was only 36,965. In the large
number of absences here indicated it is
difficult to say how many truants were
represented, but it Is likely that the num
ber of occasional and habitual truants
was large. In the face of these condi
tions it is San Francisco's duty to make
early provision for the enforcement of the
compulsory education law.
These non-attendants are of three dis
tinct classesâ first, those children willing
enough to go to school if sent, but who
are attracted by the money earning* as
pect of the work, or who. are put to work
by parents eager for an economic return;
second, there are those who are unwill
ing to return to school and whose parents
are negligent of i their children's* school
ing, and third, there are those who are
unwilling to attend school and whom
neither the parent nor the teacher can
force into regular attendance at school.
The mere appointment of attendance offi
cers will force the large majority of the
first two classes Into school.
c The rights of willing children will be
preserved against profit hungry parents
by the attendance officers and. the Juve
nile Court. Negligent parents and truant
children who are non-attendants through
tolerance will-both. be compelled' to obey
the taw. It Is with the third classâ those
whom neither the home nor the Bchool
have been : able to control hithertoâ that
we find our greatest problem. Consist
ing of habitual truants that the school
could not interest in its work and of in
corrlglbles that the school has ; turned
upon the street for the protection of the
Incorrlglble's classmates, it forms at once
a class that the school can

"We have no means at present to -know
how many children between 8 and 14 years
of age attended no school, public or pri
vate, during t"he past year, but. judging
from the number of non-attendants be
tween 6 and 17 years, as shown by the
census report, we have reason to believe
that there must have been a great num

NUMBER IN SCHOOLS.
Provision Is made for the appointment
of attendance officers, who are authorized
to arrest 1 during school hours, without
warrant, any child between 8 and 14
years of ace found away from his home
and who has been reported to him as
a truant from instruction upon which he
i3 lawfully required to attend. He shall
deliver said child so arrested to its pa
rent or if euch child has been declared
aa habitual truant he shall bring the
child before a magistrate for commit
ment by him to a parental school. Any
child who shall have been absent from
school three or more days without valid
excuse la deemed a truant In the mean
ing of thin act and when reported for
truancy tHree or more times is classed as
an habitual truant.
San Francisco now stands confronted
â¢with the responsibility of enforcing this
law within Its own jurisdiction if upon
thorough Investigation the conditions
warrant action being taken. Before, how
ever, any steps are taken to establish
truant or parental schools the school
authorities must be assured of the num
ber of truants who come within the age
limits as provided in the compulsory edu
cation law and give enough to warrant
the extra expenditures that schools of
this character will entail.
Whether or not we need such schools
in San Francisco must be determined by
an investigation of conditions, which in
vestigation we have now well under way.
Certain districts in this city are being
canvassed for truants by the Associated
Charities and the Settlement Club and
two very efficient truant officers Inves
tigate all cases of truancy reported by
the principals of the several schools. Be
fore the next school year we should have
data before us that will enable us to out
line a policy upon this very important
subject.
It is further provided that any parent,
guardian or other person having control
or charge of any such child who shall
fall to comply with the provisions of this
act *hall # unless excused or exempted
therefrom' as hereinbefore provided, be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and
upon conviction shall be liable for the
first offense to a fine of not more than
$10 or to imprisonment for not more than
five days, and for each subsequent of
fense he shall be liable to a fine of not
less than $10 nor more than $50, or to im
prisonment for not less than five day3
nor 'more than .'twenty-five days, or to
both* such' fine and lmDrisonment.
PARENTS HELD LIABLE.
The compulsory education law provfdes
that unless excused as hereinafter pro
vided each parent, guardian or other per
ron in the State of California having con
trol or charge of any child between the
ages of 8 and 14 years shall be required
to send such child to a' public school dur
ing each school year for a period of at
least five months of the time during
which a public school shall be in
session in the city or city and county or
school district in which said child resides
and at least eighteen weeks of such at
tendance shall be consecutive.
Provided, however, if it can be shown to
the proper authorities that the child's
bodily or mental condition is such as to
prevent or render inadvisable attendance
at school or that the parents are extreme
ly ooor or sick and the services of the
child are actually needed to support such
parents, or that such child is being
taught in a private school or by a pri
vate tutor, or at home by any person
capable of teaching, in such branches as
are usually taught in the primary and
grammar schools of this State; or that
the child has completed the prescribed
grammar school course, then It shall be
the dutv of the Board of Education to
excuse such child during the continuance
of such defect or condition.
There was a time when a common
school education was the privilege of a
few. Later, in America, it became a
privilege for all, the rich and the poor
alike. To-day this matter of a common
school education is ceasing to be a privi
lege for child and parent and is becom
ing a duty for both. State after State,
recognizing that a society such a3 ours
is onlv stable so long as the public opin
ion is intelligent, have passed compulsory
education laws requiring the attendance
of children at school between certain
years, usuallv between 8 and 14. Call
fcrnia ( during its last legislative session,
joined' the long list of sister States and
declared not only that children must at

statute. '.
William Langcfon, Superintendent of
Schools of San Francisco, delivered a
very able and interesting lecture at the
California Club's weekly meeting yes
terday in the Young Men's Christian
Association building. His subject was
"Compulsory Education and Parental
Schools." He said in part:
There is a commercial side to inter
collegiate football as well as a eenti
mer.tal side. This was evidenced yes
terday when Student Managers Deco
to of Berkeley and Cowden of Stan
ford pave out statistics as to the at
tendance at the big game.
Thirteen thousand five hundred spec
tators passed through the gates at
Richmond field on Saturday. The to
tal receipts were $25,173, as against
$23,000 in 1902. This represented every
ticket printed for the game, not one
being left on hand.
Out of these receipts must be paid
the expenses of the game, which in
clude rent of field, posters, tickets and
other incidentals. When all these have
been paid there will be about $10,000 for
each university. Out of this will ba
paid the expenses of coaches, trainers,
uniforms and training tables for the
men of the teams. The balance will
po into the general athletic fund.
When the athletic agreement com
mittee, which is made up of represent
atives from each college, meets in Jan
uary the most momentous Question to
be decided will be the location of the
field on which next year's game will
be played. A football field is being laid
out at Berkeley. If played there the
game is expected to lose much of its
popularity with the general public, as
the scene of the contest will not be of
such easy access as would a field in
this city.

â¢ Edna Snappe, a striking looking

was an actress, came up for hearing
yesterday. She had been arrested on
Market Btreet by Policeman Duane In
the early hours of the morning because
she insisted on trying to kick oft the

Frank Straube was another milkman
who pleaded before the bar of Justice
yesterday. He was accused by W. J. B.
Mackey, deputy health inspector, with
having poured water in his milk and
then offering it for sale. The lactometer
told the tale of the absence of butter
fats. He was found guilty, and as he
â¢wandered from the courtroom Judge
Mogan leaned far back In his chair and
hummed the milkman's hymn, '"Shall
We Gather at the River?"
J. H. Cox was in the dairy business
for five days, and during that time he
succeeded in accumulating over thirty
cans belonging to other dairies. A. F.
Green, who gathers the cans on behalf
of the Dairymen's Association, told
Judge Conlan yesterday about the un
usual accumulation of Cox and be
sought him to find the defendant guilty
of petty larceny. From an expert's
standpoint he claimed that Cox could
not have accumulated the cans hon
estly. The courtroom looked like a
dairy with the accumulated evidence.
Judge Conlan wanted to hear more
about the milk question, and set the
case over until to-morrow.
Allen Ledet, a French woman, ap
peared before Judge Cabaniss yester
day on the charge of practicing medi

the prosecution brought forth a sign
with the inscription "Positive cure for

the French woman pretended to cure
skin diseases. On her own behalf she

thought that one who made a single

Joseph Cochrane, ivho welds steel
when it is at white heat when at work,
laid off on election day. After he had
cast his ballot he was overcome with
a desire for a cigarette. Following his
desire he invaded the election booth
and insisted that one of the judges give
him a cigarette. The judge. was bfisy
and ordered him out. He refused to go
and Policeman Blick assisted his exit.
He broke in again, still insistent on a
cigarette, and was thrown out once
more. During intervals of objection
his friend, Dan McNamara, slightly
more sober than he, tried to pacify
him. At the third invasion Policeman
Blick decided to send Cochrane to Jail
and started with him for the patrol
box. McNamara allowed his friendship
for the arrested man to overpower his
judgment, with the result that Coch
rane broke away from the arresting
officer and McNamara was taken in
tow instead. Both appeared before
Judge Fritz yesterday and were fined
$5. They were evidently hard working
men who had gone wild a little on
election and the Judge was inclined to
be lenient with them.
Patrick J. Curran, a baker by occu
pation, made all kinds of mistakes dur
ing a drunk that lasted from Saturday
night until Monday. First he mistook
the character of the food that was'
served him at a restaurant at 840 How
ard street on the last day of his spree.
To rectify this he went out and gath
ered his clothes full of lumps of coal,
which, on his return, he proceeded to
cast at the chef. The cook was agi!e
and managed to sidestep the coal, bul
the crockery and tinware suffered
some. Captain of Police Anderson was
passing and arrested Curran. Then
the unfortunate man made his second
mistake. He mistook the handsome
captain for Mayor Schmitz. "Please
don't put me in jail, Mr. Mayor," he
pleaded. Yesterday he came before
Judge Cabaniss for his doom. He de
veloped a deafness that was surpris
ing. The Judge stirred the echoes of
the prison upstairs and unstrung the
nerves of the waiting patrolmen on of

of Justice trying to get an explanation
from Curran of the reason he had for
throwing coal at the cook. Every one
in tlje corridors jumped at the conclu

broken loose and overpowered the bai

to the last redoubt and was fighting
for law and order with hands and

just arrest and then promptly assessed
them a fine of 510 or ten days. As one
of the defendants was connected with
a prominent lumber firm of Seattle and
the other was the manager of the Both
kin Real Estate Company they paid
their fines readily. But before they
were let go they had to listen to a sen
sible talk from Judge Cabanlss on the
rights of pedestrians.
The court told them that ignorance
of the law was often an excuse for
kniency in his court, but ignorance of
the rights of others never was. He
said that he had noticed the prevalence
of the idea among automobile drivers
that the streets at all hours were con
secrated to their use, which was an en
tirely false assumption. The streets,
he said, were tor the people, and a pe
destrian had as much right in the mid
die of one as he had lit his own horn*,
provided that he did not interfere with
legitimate traffic. Automobiles that
impugned on that right by traveling at
a hich rate of speed were a nuisance
and so far as he could he intended to
abate them. Accordingly he fined
Kaufman $10 and assessed the same
amount to Merrill. When the latter
pleaded in extenuation that he was a
resident of Seattle and unacquainted
with the local ordinances the Judge as
sured him suavely that he pitied him
sincerely for having to live outside of
San Francisco and assured him that a.3
a matter of hospitality he would accord
hÂ£u the regular domestic rates in the
jnatter of fines.

Conrad Keith, a street sweeper, whose
nine bank books show that he is worth
in the neighborhood of $20,000, received
a six months' sentence for petty lar
ceny in Judge Conlan's court yester
day. Soon after his installation as a
"trusty" in the City Prison he an
nounced that he would wed Miss Rosle
Burton of 1134 Green street to-day, and
asked permission to have the ceremony
come off in the jail. Since his arrest
two weeks"*ago he has told many tales
of his engagement to Miss Burton, and
love for her -seemed to be a particular
hobby with him.
Keith, who is .42 years of age, says
he met the young woman six years ago
and that they became engaged two
years ago. He said the reason the cer
emony was not performed sooner was
because he had deceived Her as to the
amount of his wealth and she desired
him to accumulate more. When Miss
Burton was seen at her home last even
ing she was preparing for her marriage
to Walter J. Rock 'of 1268 Union street,
which Is scheduled for to-night. She is
23 years of age, very pretty and has
been In the employ of the telephone
company. She says she was never en
gaged to Keith, nor had she been ap
proached by him on the subject of love.
She believes him demented. . â¢
â¢ When told of the girl's proposed mar
riage to Rock, Keith admitted that he
had not consulted her in regard to a
prison marriage, but still persists that
he was engaged to her. The police
think him insane.
First came Kate Gallagher, fifteen
years ago a belle of the town. She has
prominent relatives, who cast her off
years ago, and she has been arrested
on various charges, according to the
police records. 472 times. "When she
is good she Is very, very good, but
when she Is bad she is horrid." Judge
Mogan thought that six months in the
House of Correction was about due
her.
"Ninety out of a hundred of the
cases that come before me," said Judge
Mogan yesterday, "may be attributed
to overindulgence in drink." This was
plentifully illustrated in the Police
Courts.

Constantino Castiglione, who some
times used his name to file saws with,
was arrested yesterday on the com
plaint of Frank Morracci, whose ap
pellation somehow suggests the ragged I
edges of the Sicilian mountains. Both I
of them are of trans-Alpine birth. The
complainant says that" in front of the
building at 410 Broadway Castiglione
assaulted him with an iron bar. Under
the skillful questioning of Louis Ward,
assistant to the District Attorney, Mor
racci admitted that he was an agent
of the Italian Government sent to look
for anarchists. His instructions, ac
cording to his story, were to overlook
the Mafia and find only anarchists.
Castiglione and his 1 friends, says Mor
racci, are anarchists of the deepest dye.
They want to wallow in the blood of
rulers. Castiglione, after he was ar
rested and released on $50 bail, gave a
different story. He said that Morracci
was a "bum" who never worked and
was not a representative of the Italian
Government. In going to his work yes
terday, he says, he met Morracci and
the latter assaulted him. He had a
stick with him and struck the anarch
ist sleuth on the head. The clash is
to be refereed by Judge Mogan this
morning.

"AT WORK"
Free Sunday, Nov. 22, 1903
The publisher of The Call, in anticipating the tendency of the times
in giving more time to recreation, hunting "and fishing, has acquired for
their exclusive use a series of art pictures which, will serve as reminders
; during the busy months of those delightful days passed in the field. * â¢
"At "Work," the title of the next Sunday Call's offering, is a reproduc-
tion from an oil painting by J. M. Tracy, an artist whose paintings of
â¢ dogs have never been surpassed.
Mr. Tracy had for the subject of this study the celebrated Llewellyn
setter, "RODERIGO," who became famous in this country by his clean
sweep of bench and field events.
This picture, while it appeals strongly to those who know every point
in a dog, is perhaps Just as interesting to the many who lova the faithful
animal.
In handling, color and action, "At Work" is a most life-like study; a
picture that, when framed, could with difficulty be distinguished from
the original oil painting.
To overlook this is to miss one of the best of the SpoTtsmen'a Series.

James Kerwan, a well known charac
ter around the water front, died in St.
Mary's Hospital yesterday morning
from scalds received while taking a
tub bath in the Crystal baths on No
vember 7. He had been accustomed .to
the use of very hot water and when
he went to his home at 62 Bay street,
he informed his married daughter that
his back pained him. He grew rapidly
worse and was taken to the hospital,
where it was found that his akin from
the waist down had- been cooked.

JAMES KERWAN'S HOT
BATH CAUSES DEATH
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17.â Counsel
for for the Northern Securities Com
pany to-day filed a motion in the
United States Supreme Court to dismiss
the appeal of the State of Minnesota
from the decision of the United States
Circuit Court for the District of Minne
sota in the case of that State versus
the Securities Company. The motion Is
made on the ground that no question
of constitutional construction is in
volved in the case, and therefore no di
rect appeal from the Circuit Court to
the United States Supreme Court Is
permissible. In their brief in support
of the motion counsel contend that
while the suit was enjoined on Federal
grounds as well as State statutes, none
of the rulings of the Circuit Court in
volved the construction or application
of the Federal constitution. They said:
"To warrant a direct appeal from the
Circuit Court to this court on constitu
tional grounds the case must involve a
constitutional question really and sub
stantially and not imaginative. The
case involves a Federal question and
so was properly brought into the Cir
cuit Court as a case arising under the
laws of the United States. The sole
question is whether a direct appeal can
be taken from the Circuit Court to the
Supreme Court. It is not material that
a constitutional question might have
been raised here toy the appellees had
they been defeated below or if some
different decision had been made in the
case a constitutional question might
have become involved. The decision
of this court settled that the constitu
tional question must be in the case ac
tually, and not potentially; that is,
that the question must have been di
rectly decided by the lower court or
have been necessarily involved in what
was decided."

During the trip to-day these matters
will be fully discussed and in trme they
will be drawn to the attention of the
authorities for the purpose of having
them carefully looked into by the Fed
eral Government.
It is contended that if a light should
break down and at the same time the
patrol vessel should be "put out of
commission," there would be great
danger to vessels, because there would
not be any to place in the immediate
vicinity of the dismantled light. It Is
also desired that there should be light
buoys at different points to assist navi
gation in the night. As it is now the
vessels are compelled to follow the al
most obsolete custom of sailing by day
and dropping anchor at dark. It Is
claimed that there should be a light at
Point Agosta and that the one at Cape
Mendocino ought to be abandoned.
California proposes to ask for a num
ber of things that will result, if
adopted, in greater protection to prop
erty and human life. "The people in
the East," said Captain Parsons, who
was present when the captain general
was telling of his visit here, "get all
they ask for, and there is no good rea
son why California should not get what
Is absolutely necessary."
Among the things that California
wants is the removal of two rocks eas^t
of the Pacific Mail dock In the bay of
San Francisco, that are a menace to
navigation. At times there is but
four ar.d a half fathoms of water on
these rocks and that is too shallow for
steamers that have a thirty-foot
draft. It is true that these are mark
ed by buoys, but still they are danger
ous and ought to he removed. Another
is the necessity fcr a light and fog sta
tion at Army Point in the bay of San
Francisco. Still another is the addi
tional patrol ship for the lighthouse
service. At this time there is but one,
the Madrone. to patrol a coast 800 miles
long. It is the Judgment Â«of those most
interested in deep-water navigation
that there ought to be two such ships,
as the distance traveled is too great for
safety.
To-day the grand captain will be the
pruest of the State on an excursion
around the bay. a tug of the Harbor
Commissioners having been placed at
his disposal for a tour of observation.
He will be accompanied by some of the
State officers, who are interested in the
navigation of the bay and the inland
waters; by members of the United
States Engineer Corps, city officials
and prominent master mariners and
pilots.
His talks on the occasion of these
visits were for the good of each branch
of the parent organization and many
matters of interest for the betterment
of conditions were discussed, although
the harbors of this city, so said the
grand captain yesterday, have less
grievances than those on the Atlantic
seaboard. The rights and duties of in
spectors were explained and he im
parted a great deal of valuable infor
mation to the harbors which will be
assistance to them in the future.
John C. Silva, captain general of the
Grand Harbor of the Association of
ilaster Mariners and Pilots of the
United States and Territories, has been
the guest of the San Francisco harbors
since his arrival in this city on Friday
last. During his stay here he met the
two harbors of this city, California No.
15 and Golden Gate No. 40, in the
Pythian Castle, and to each he paid aa
oiliclal visit.
Mr. Woodworth filed complaint yes
terday to recover $18,000 from Frank A.
McKee and Pearley Maxwell, being the
alleged value of tan bark and tan oak
wood cut by them on Government land
in Humboldt County.
Manuel Fernandez, a seaman former
ly employed, on the steamship Daunt
less, filed a iibel against that vessel to
recover~$600 damages alleged to have
been sustsfined by the breaking of his
left leg while on duty on the vessel
on August 18. He charges the ship's
officers with negligence.
T. C. West filed a demurrer to the
indictment against Lee Sing Gee, Wong
Suey Quong, Choy Gut and Yee Lee,
the Chinese laborers who were substi
tuted for Chinese immigrants allowed
to escaoe by the late William P. Gam
ble, deputy United States Marshal. The
demurrer was taken under advisement.
On motion of United States District"
Attorney Woodworth the case of the
United States against the Tyro Mining
Company for cutting timber on Gov
ernment land was dismissed. It was
ascertained by Government experts
that the defendant had gone out of ex
istence and had never been incorpo
rated. The suit was instituted before
Mr. Woodworth became United States
Attorney.
In the United States District Court
yesterday the Progreso Steamship Com
pany, as owner of thS steamship Edith,
filed a libel against the steamship
Charles Nelson to recover $35,000
salvage for towing the derelict steam
schooner Charles IS^lson into the port
of San Francisco. The value of the
Nelson, as she now lies, is said to be
between $80,000 and $90,000, and that of
her cargo of lumber at $5000.
The waterlogged'" Charles Nelson was
placed on the Sixteenth street dry dock
late yesterday afternoon, and to-day
surveyors will estimate the amount of
damage she sustained on her semi
submarine trii> down the coast. The
water was pumped out of her late
Monday afternoon, and during the
night about a foot leaked through her
strained seams. As far .as can be
judged at present the coaster's hull,
although slightly "hogged," is in good
shape, and the salvage earned by Cap
tain Hall will probably amount to a
substantial sum.
Although the suit is brought against
John C. Lynch the Government is the
responsible defendant.
It is alleged further that for' the pe
riod from March 3, 1902, to October 9,
1902, Lynch collected the further* sum
of 515,324, whereas the gross recepits
from the business other than that of
refining sugar were $41,625, no part of
which is taxable under the act, says
the complaint.
It is contended that the act makes an
illegal, unjust and arbitrary discrim
ination, founded on the pretended dif
ference between the business of man
ufacturing sugar and that of refining
the same, between the complainant and
other firms â¢ refining Â» sugar. For this
and other reasons it is contended that
the act is invalid and unconstitutional.
The complaint alleges that Lynch by
force and duress and under cover of
the act collected that sum from the
complainant illegally as internal rev
enue war tax. It is alleged that from
December 15, 1S93, to January 28, 1902,
he collected $69,282 32 under protest,
whereas the gross receipts from the
complainant's business from other
sources than its business of refining
sugar, namely, $61,241 for interest on
losses and debts, was not taxable un
der the provisions of the act.
To test the constitutionality of the
act of Congress entitled "An act to
provide ways and means to meet war
expenditures and for other purposes,"
approved June 13, 1S93, the Western
Sugar Refining Company filed suit in
the United States Circuit Court yes
terday, through its attorneys, Morrison
6 Cope, against John C. Lynch, United
States Collector of Internal Revenue,
to recover $84,606 43, with interest at
7 per cent and costs.

the unfavorable weather and lower cables and
December opened a shad* higher to Uc lower

tons, against 197,Â«SW. During the past week a
number of grain carrying vessels have left this

WHEATâ The foreign markets continaed
quiet and featureless. Bradstreet's gave the
world's visible supply an Increase of 3.113,000
bushels.
Chicago reported cables easier and the crowd
short, with the market l^c higher. A dispatch
from there said: "'With exhaustion of Winter
Wheat and the rapid falling off in Spring
Wheat recently It will require heavy selling
pressure to hold the -market down much
longer." _
The Chicago wires of Bolton, de Ruyter A
Co . said: "Market is fairly active, with
strength mainly speculative and en profession
al trading. There was little or no change In
news or conditions. Cables were weak. Pri
mary receipts la excess of last year, and ex
port demand not much ia evidence. The trad
ing the last few days had created some short
interest and Armour is supposed to be a buyer
of May'wheat. Elevator people generally sell
ing December and baying May. BroomhaU ca
bles European crop prospects are in the main
favorable, and that the estimate of the Argen
tine surplus is U2.000.0w bushels. Northwest
reports flour demand good. We see no reason
to change our previous views that it will be a
difficult proposition to maintain a ball market
under present conditions."
There was no material chanse here. The
market continaed quiet. Futures were lower

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK. Nov. 17.â Trading ia the stock
market dmlAdled to a low ebb tc-day and the
- .;.:>.-= was prrcressfve. This was regarded
as a elgnlScact development following th* ces
sation cf bear pressure against stocks and was
accepted aa an Indication tfcat there was little
tnclisation to emtark In speculative ventures
ia the stock tnarket as yet. The awakenir.g
frcm a long dormant state of stocks o-f a num
ber of less irsrortait railroad companies and
their brt*k advance, so far from having aa en
couraging effect ca the buying of Etock*,
sÂ»enie>i to awaken suspicion. The notoriety ot
the exiztfcr.c* of *Â£>eculatlve pools in many oÂ£
thes* stocks which have a connecting
common interest caused many rumors
of developments la their aÂ£airs to
be suspiciously regarded. The small
volume cf the capital Israel cf corporations of
this class aad thÂ« narrow limits of the circle
within which they are held makes tbem spe
cially available tor manipulation. The rise ta
the call money rate to Â«> per cent late ia the.
day comtleted the disfavor with which the
movement was regarded aid retained the
course oj prices downward. The result was to
wipe out the earlier gains, which had reached
a point or over ia many reuresentatlve stocks.
Pennsylvania, especially, was ia demand, pre
Â«uâ ai'iy frcm the short interest left uncovered
ia th* stock after its extended decline. The up
ward movement of the morning was due to the
renewed feeling of coafldeace over the moaey
octlook. Announcements were made of a num
ber cf ergagemeats of gold ia London for im
pcrt. ccaSnrlng reports which were current
yesterday. Sterltar made a sharp recovery.
Part cf the demand was due to the purchases
of bllU agalcst the gold engaged for Import.
There was eaid to be Urge buying of sterling
Tor investment by bankers. Rates for time
leans even for the sixty-day period, were <juo
laiiy" easy to-day aad the demand for longer
pÂ«?r-.ods was wholly nominal. United States
Steel was held back by t>e London view that
further cuts ia steel products are likely. Mls
iourt Pacific's net Increase for September of
more than $Â£fi>).QtX> was favorably regarded, but
Its efTect en tie general list wan oCsÂ«t bv the

The market shows no further r>angÂ«. being
quiet and featureless.. Chicago was about as
before. The Chicago wires of Boltsa, De
Ruyter & Co. said: "Receipts of Hogs arÂ«
increasing somewhat, but thÂ« demand eca
tisues fair and there -is- not much selllag
pressure. ' Packing Interests are not leading
much support to prices and outside trade is
dull. We still, feel that after the great de
cline and with provisions selling at about a
4c basis fcr hogs they won't lose much money
if becght on the weak sscts. and - that later
the. market may do better."
Provisions.
Hay continues In good sfcase- for sellers, and
Oat is quoted slightly higher. Cars are still
scarce and the trade eay that. If they contlnua
so-there may be another advance in prices be

should be. and are hardly up to the demand.

Avers He Had Confidence ot Being
Elected as the Late Cam
paign Developed. -
Franklin K. Lane, Democratic nomi
nee for Mayor at the last election, has
issued a statement explaining the
statement he made regarding his
chances of being elected. Following. Is
Lane's statement:
- . November 17,. 1903. .
To the Editor of The Call: Since my
return to the city I find that a state
ment made by me the day after the elec
tion has been misinterpreted. I then
said that at the time of my acceptance
of the nomination for Mayor I told
friends In my office who were urging me
to accept that I did not believe I could
win. foreseeing a purely class contest
and doubting my ability to make the
public see what I conceived to be the
real Issues^of the campaign.' This state
ment has been misconstrued into an
expression of my belief throughout the
campaign that failure was inevitable.
A re-reading of the statement will show
that no such interpretation is warranted.
As the campaign developed my earlier
impression wore away and I ; came
toward the close to. believe the prospect
of success to be excellent, and this be
lief was shared by all whom I met after
the meeting at the Mechanics' Pavilion.
Respectfully. FRANKLIN K. LANE.

_CUST GIVE PARTICU_ARS
The benefit concert given by St John's
Episcopal choir lasteveningin the Guild
Hall drew a large and enthusiastic au
dience. Besides the members of the
congregation, there were many repre
sentatives from other churches present.
The programme was well arranged,
and? every number received an encore
and some of them , two or three. As a
musical treat it was a gem in- every
particular. Not only were the selec
tions of a high class, but they had the
distinction of being especially well ren
dered. Everybody present enjoyed the
entertainment and on all sides praise
was showered upon the participants^â
praise that was honestly and sincerely
earned.
.The two numbers by the full choir,
under the direction of George R. King,
was given in splendid style and were
received' with the . great enthusiasm
they deserved.
"Wilfred Glenn was in fine voice and
rendered both his selections In capital
style. R.' E. Keene has a big barytone
voice and he knows how to sing. His
song, "Until You Came," was splendid
ly given. Miss Broderick sang "Love
Is a Bubble" most charmingly. Miss
"Weston sang "A Red, Red Rose" most
artistically. The Press Club Quartet
came in for a great meed > of praise
and was compelled to respond to al
most seemingly endless encores. Among
them were "Simple Simon,". "Little
Willie,", "Laughing Gas." "April Fan
tasie"- and "Kentucky Babe.", Miss
King, who was the accompanist of the
evening, was most valuable" in all the
numbers in which she participated. -
The mixed quartet, composed of Mis9
Rose Broderick. soprano: Miss Ruth
Weston, contralto; A. E. McMillan, ten
or, and D. M. Warde, basso, sang ad
mirably. .
The Press Club Quartet consists of
A. E. McMillan, first tenor; R. H.
Hunt, second tenor; George- R. King,
first bass, and R.E. Keene, second
bass. - Â¦ Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦'. "â¢ .â¢â¢ - : * .-. -r;"::>
REDDING. Nov. 17.â In the role of a
friend ot her husband a burglar en-*
tered the home of Mrs. ' S." Evans at
Upton, Siskiyou County, last Wednes-'
day afternoon at 5 o'clock and told her
he came to advise her about investing
money in land. When she produced a
sack containing about $30 the stranger
knocked her Â¦ down, grabber the sack,
containing the money, then beat the
prostrate woman into insensibility and
made his escape.
Upton is a thriving little lumbering
town and the Evans home is situated
in .a central location. Evans is em
ployed in the camp . and had not re
turned from his labors when his wife 1
was bo brutally attacked. A knock at
the front door called' her and . as she
opened K she- was. greeted -by a man
well dressed and of polite bearing, but
a stranger. .He gave a fictitious name,
told her he was a friend of the family
and stated that "he came to counsel her
in regard to an investment "she was
really about to make. . .-, Â¦ ?
TRff^man gained Mrs. Evans* confi
dence to such an extent that she-went
to a back room -and returned with th*
sack of money. From this she intend
ed to give the man money for his ad -I
vice. As soon as she entered the rooia
he made the attack on her. " .; .. . \;
The people of Upton and vicinity are
greatly wrought up over the affalr.-
Offlcers and a posse of men have, beeni
scouring the country for the robber and*
should he be caught there will be very,
little ceremony regarain'g what, disposi
tion will be made of him. v - '

WOMAN TESTIFIES
AGAINST MOODY
Case of an Ex- Congress- 1
man Progresses in
Portland.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 17.â The tak
ing of testimony in the trial of ex-Con
gressman Malcolm M. Moody, indicted
for intercepting and withholding a let
ter addressed to Mrs. Margaret L. Con
roy, formerly of The Dalles, was com
menced in Judge Bellinger's Federal
court to-day.
Mrs. Conroy, the chief witness for
the prosecution, who was in the witness
chair most of the day, stated that at
the time of the failure of The Dalles
National Bank she had on deposit in
that Institution $2000. The batik, of
which Moody was president, paid its
depositors In full, and after receiving
what purported to be the final dividend
Mrs. Conroy testified that she took the
money and certain papers to her attor
neys and then learned that she had not
been fully paid, the amount received be
ing $92-35 short.
On the representations of her attor
neys and herself Moody asked her to
sign a receipt, which he would forward
to the Comptroller of the Currency for
collection. Mrs. Conroy stated that
while she was signing the document
Moody kept his hand over a large por
tion of it, hiding it in a measure from
her view. She noticed, however, that
the paper had borne another signature,
but that It had been erased.
After signing the receipt she conclud
ed to forward the paper to Washington
herself, and securing the document
took it to her attorneys and then for
the first time learned that it was a re
ceipt for the full amount, and should
have been presented to her by Moody
some time before. Her attorneys, she
stated, had never been able to obtain
it from Moody. Cross-examination de
veloped nothing of importance.
Previous to Mrs. Conroy being placed
on the stand- Postmaster Patterson of
The Dalles testified to having turned
over several letters addressed to Mrs.
Conroy to Congressman Moody, who
readdressed some of them to Mrs. Con
roy, who. had moved to Portland.
Moody took some . of the letters away
with him, but . the Postmaster could
not state that they had been forwarded
to Mrs. Conroy. \ V
Judge Bellinger, on objections being
made by the attorneys for the'defense.
decided that two of the counts returned
against Moody by the Federal Grand
Jury were unwarranted, and they were
thrown out.

In the case of Helen Sullivan, the 6
year-old girl killed by a street car at
the crossing of Twentieth and Ken
tucky streets, the motorman was exon
erated.
"And we further recommend that in
future in such cases a more modern
and suitable apparatus be devised and
used."
The jury returned a verdict to the
effect that the accident was "unavoid
able" and exonerated the attaches of
the hospital from all blame. It added
the following:
Coroner- Leland held an inquest yes
terday morning into the cause of the
death of Ivy Powell, an 11-months-old
boy, who was burned to death in the
Children's Hospital last Monday while
being treated for croup. Miss Ethel
Stafford, the nurse in attendance, tes
tified that while the vaporizing appa
ratus was In operation on the child she
was summoned to another room to an
swer a telephone call from the baby's
parents, and that when she returned
the child's gown was on fire, the ap
paratus having exploded during her
absence.
More Modern Apparatus for Vaporiz
ing in Children's Hospital Is
Recommended in Verdict.
Several cars had passed over the
body and the skull "was crushed to a
pulp a.pd many bones broken. The re
mains were removed to the Morgue by
Deputy Charles Meehan. Deceased was
41 years of age and resided at the
Niagara House, 763 Howard sfreet. He
was unmarried and his relatives reside
in Milwaukee, Wls.
Upon the arrival of the vessel at
Lombard-street wharf Wintrinser was
sent ashore by one of the officers to
look after some freight. As there were
no eye-witnesses to the tragedy it is
not known how the unfortunate man
came to his death. It is supposed that
in crossing the tracks of the Belt rail
road he fell in front of a moving train.
His body was discovered by one of the
trainmen, who notified the Coroner's
office.
Paul Wintringer, a deckhand em
ployed on the steamer Ukiah, was
crushed to death beneath the wheels of

ing Mr. Bourn was asked if the board
contemplated changes in the present
schedule of 4 rates for supplying light
and power. -,
He replied that he could not fore
shadow the course that the directors
would pursue, but he was of the opin
ion that the income under the present
schedule would enable the company to
pay a small dividend seml-annually to
the stockholders. . He fancied, more
over, that the growth of the city and
the increased demand for light would
bring the corporation a fair profit un
der the existing schedule of prices.
He remarked that he could not
speak definitely as to whether the di
rectors at the meeting to-day would
or would not declare a dividend.
PLANTS ARE MODERN.
DIRECTORS WILL MEET.
Subsequently deeds showing the
transfer of the properties were placed
on record in the Recorder's office. A
trust mortgage was also placed on rec
ord by the San Francisco (Jas and
Electric Company in favor of the Union
Trust Company to secure an issue of
bonds In the sum of $10,000,000, payable
November, 1933. with interest at 4Va per
cent a year. The security given com
prises all the property of the corpora
tion.
At the meeting yesterday the pur
chasing corporation, the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company, was repre
sented bjc its president, William B.
Bourn, Captain Payson and Attorney
Charles Page. Claus Spreckels was
represented by A. B. and John D.
Spreckels.
The .negotiationsâ initial, progressive
and finalâ were managed by the Union
Trust Company. I. W. Hellman presi
dent.
At the office of the Union Trust Com
pany, in this city, yesterday afternoon
a complete transfer was made to the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany of all the properties, including
stocks, bonds, machinery and appur
tenances, of the Independent Electric
Light and Power Company and the In
dependent Gas and Power Company.
This transfer consummated the sale
under the terms of an agreement en
tered into July 2, 1903. Cash and bonds
Â»'o the amount of $6,210,000 were paid to
John D. and A. B. Spreckels, as stipu
lated in the articles of agreement.
That they might secure the valuable
jade, the robbers hurled the stone
through the window and narrowly
missed breaking several articles of
lacquer ware valued at about $1500.
After they had made the Jbening they
reached in with a long stick and got
their treasure. Near the aperture made
by the stone were about ten articles of
silverware, the total value of which
would approximate $1000. Although
these could have been reached by the
hand, they were left untouched.
In speaking of the robbery, Marsh
says he is certain that it was commit
ted by Chinese or some thieves well
posted on the value of jade. The neck
lace or the bracelets would not have at
tracted particular attention from the
ordinary" thief and the latter would
probably have gone after the silver
ware. Captain Martin is of the same
opinion and believes that if the job was
done by a white man no effort will be
made to dispose of the stolen property
here, bu: that it will be shipped to the
Jiiast.
One of the most daring burglaries
committed in the downtown section of
the city for some time was reported to
Captain of Detectives' Martin yesterday
morning. Some time during Monday
night thieves smashed a large plate
glass window in the fancy goods estab
lishment of G. T. Marsh, 214 Post street,
with a cobble stone and then made
their escape with a jade necklace val
ued at $500 and a pair of jade bracelets
valued at $140. The police are of the
opinion that Chinese or some persons
well acquainted with the value of jade
did the work, as they seemed deter
mined to secure these articles only and
overlooked silverware that was in the
same window. . /â¢ -i
Judge de Haven can no longer assist
Judge Morrow because of the pressure
of business in the District Court.
The new judgreship will not interfere
in any way with United States District
Judge de Haven, who will continue to
preside in the District Court. This plan
is in operation in New York, Missouri,
Illinois and some other States, where
the Judges of the United States Court
qf Appeals are relieved from all other
court work.
[ At the present session of Congress
i a bill will be introduced on the sugges-'
j tion of United States Senator Perkins
and the remainder of the California
delegation to create an additional
United States District Judge in the
Northern District of California. Owing
to the fact that during the last three
years the business of the Circuit Court
has increased very largely, requiring
the whole of Judge Morrow's time, and
the further facf that the business of
the United States Circuit Court of Ap
peals has increased In a like ratio, the
Judge has been overwhelmed with
work, and it is the opinion of members
of the bar practicing in His court that
he should have assistance.
It was at first proposed to ask Con
gress to create a new District Court
for the eastern district of California,
with headquarters in the city of Sacra r
mento, but this plan was objected to
because of the great expense involved
for clerks, an additional United States
Marshal and other officials. The latest
propositionâ the one that meets with
more favorâ Is that of an additional
United States Judge in this district, to
preside in the United States Circuit
Court and relieve Judge Morrow of the
double burden under which he has been
laboring for many years.
There are said to be about twelve
candidates for the position, among
whom is United States District Attor
ney Marshall B. Woodworth, who has
the indorsement of United States Cir
cuit Judge Morrow and of the Califor
nia Congressmen. . i
