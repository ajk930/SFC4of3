General Stewart was loth to be Inter
viewed: He was unable to say who his
successor would be, and he declined to tell
-what his report to the national conven
tion would contain. This is the third time
he has been In this State. Seventeen years
ago he attended the annual encampment
here, and he notes with pleasure the im
provements that have been wrought In
that time. He was here last February to
complete arrangements for the encamp
ment that opens to-day. He stopped at
Sacramento and addressed the members
of the Legislature, and his reception was
a notable one. Both houses of the Legis
lature extended him marked courtesies.
He "delivered two splendid speeches, and
it was* then that the lawmakers.discov
ered that the general was as great en
orator as he is a soldier:

committee were also in the party.
Carriages conveyed the party to the
Palace, where the general and his family
will be quartered. The rooms of the com
mander in chief were beautifully deco
rated with flowers. The general was de
lighted at the warmth of his reception
and expressed his pleasure on being here
again.
and was welcomed by a distin
guished gathering of soldiers and civil

"It Is said in extenuation of lynching in
case of assault that it is an additional
cruelty to the unfortunate victim to com
pel her to go upon a witness stand and
in the presence of a mixed audience tell
the story of her wrongs, especially when
she may be subjected to cross-examina
tion by over-zealous counsel. I do not
believe this matter, but it znust be re
membered that often the unfortunate vic
tim never lives to tell the story of her
wrongs, and If she does survive she must
tell it to some, and the whole community
knows the fact Even In the courtroom
any hlchmir.ded Judge will stay counsel
from any unnecessary cross-examination,
and, finally. If any lawyer should attempt
it the community may treat him as an
outcast. I can but think that if the com
munity felt that the criminal would cer
tainly receive the punishment he deserves
and receive It soon the eagerness for
lynching would disappear and mobs,
whose gatherings too often mean not
merely the destruction of jails and other
property but also the loss of Innocent
lives would greatly diminish In number.
"One thing is certain, the tendency of
lynching Is to undermine respect for the
law, and unless it Is checked we need net
be astonished If It be resorted to for all
kinds of offenses and oftentimes Innocent
men suffer for wrongs committed by
others." -
CRUELTY TO WITNESS.
"What can be done to stay this epidemic
of lynching? One thing is the estab
lishment of a greater confidence In the
summary and certain punishment of the
criminal. Men . are afraid of the law's
delays and the uncertainty of its results.
Not that they doubt the Integrity of the
Judges, but they know that the law
abounds with technical rules and that ap
pellate : courts will often reverse a Judg
ment or conviction for a disregard of such
rules, notwithstanding a full belief in the
guilt of the accused. If all were certain
that the guilty ones would be promptly
tried and punished, the inducement to
lynch would be . largely taken away. In
an address which I delivered before the
American Bar Association at Detroit
some years since, I advocated doing away
with appeals in criminal -cases.
"It did not meet the favor of the asso
ciation, but I still believe In Its W3dom.
For nearly a hundred years there was no
appeal from the Judgment of convction of
criminal cases in our Federal courts and
no review except in a few cases in which
two Judges sitting, a difference of opinion
on a queston of law was certified to {he
Supreme Court. In England the rule haa
been that there will be no appeal In crim
inal cases, although \a question of doubt
might be reserved by the presiding Judge
for the consideration of his brethren. Hon.
E. J. Phelps, who was Minister to Eng
land during Mr. Cleveland's first admin
istration, once told me that while he was
there only two cases were so reversed.
Does any one doubt that justice was fully
administered by the English courts?
â¢at Is well to look the matter fairly in
the face. Many good men Join in these
uprisings, horrified at the atrocity of the
crime and eager for swift and summary
punishment. Of course, they violate the
law themselves, but rÂ«;ly on the public
sentiment" behind them ; for escape from
punishment. Many of these lynchings are
accompanied by the horrible barbarities
of savage torture, and all that can be said
in palliation is the atrocity of the of
fenses which led up to them. For a time
they were confined largely to the South,
but that section of the country no longer
has the monopoly. The chief offense
which causes these lynchinga has been
the assault of white women by colored
men. No words can be found to de
scribe the atrocity of such a crime. It Is
no wonder that the community Is excited.
Men would disgrace their manhood if
they were not. And if a few lynchings
had put a stop to the offense society
might have condoned such breaches of its
laws, but the fact is, If we may credit
reports, the black beast (for only a beast
would be guilty of such an offense) seems
to be not deterred thereby.
SWIFT JUSTICE NEEDED.
"Our Government recently forwarded to
Russia a petition in respect to alleged
atrocities committed upon the Jews. That
Government, as might have been ex
pected, unwilling to have' Its Internal af
fairs a matter of consideration by other
Governments, declined to receive the peti
tion. If, Instead of so doing it had re
plied that it would put a stop to all such
atrocities when this Government put a
stop to lynchings, what could we hav*
said?

to a terrible beating administered to
Frank Ortoff, the Wyoming stage robber
who led the jail break several days ago.

Dorval alleges he saw Ortoff kicked in

"I am determined not to discuss poli
tics and am sorry to see that some pa
pers have been accrediting me with the
statements on political lines that have
no authorization. I have made no state
ments that might have a political con

print are absolutely false. As to matters
of the army, I am cut Â«-f that nowâ I
have retired. I have no word to say
about President Roosr-clt or concerning
those who are identified with the mill

have gone on record as opposed to the
staff plan of the army, but I do not think
It proper to enter into a discussion of the
subject, for I have nothing further to
do with such matters. I opposed it when
I was In a position to do so, but that Is
neither here nor there."
NOT DISCUSSING POLITICS.
As a rule General Miles is retiring in
nature. Yesterday, however, he freely
mingled among the old soldiers, bowing
and shaking hands in response to their
greetings and entering interestingly into
their discussions of wartime incidents. He
smiled as one old veteran referred to the
battle of Fair Oaks, which marked the
beginning of the general's active military
career, and stood patiently before another
who was anxious to remind him that he
remembered the general at the final
skirmishes with WIlcox's and Heth's di
visions at Southerland Station, when
Miles, then a colonel serving under Gen
eral Grant, distinguished himself by put
ting to rout the Southerners after captur
ing 1000 of their number. He spent' an
interesting hour among the bluecoated
veterans and then turned himself over to
the newspaper reporters.
"Strange, isn't it, that I can never es
cape the newspaper men?" he remarked
as a sort of preface to the inquiries that
he anticipated. "Well, I will state for
your information that I am simply here
to have a good time with the soldier boys
and I intend to have It. As to my future
movements I am not yet ready to say
Just what they may be, for as a matter

He said the annual encampment brought
about the transaction of important busi
ness and that it. was held for the electJon
of national officers. He asid:
There Is no organization In the world which
Is built on thÂ« same lines as the Grand Army
of the Republic. No organization Is so gen
eral In its comradeship and its fraternal-
Ism. These encampments Â¦ bring the survivors
of the Rebellion together, and the meetings
of /he men who shouldered their musket* and
went to the front In their nation's defense are
conducive of great good. They recall the
days when they sat round the campfire and
heard the shots of the pickets in the dis
tance. They recall old scenes and brine up
memories. Tire Grand Army is gradually di
minishing In n,umbers. Fifty thousand men die
each year. It Is an organization which can
not avail Itself of recruits. ' Thirty-eight years
ago these brave men fought, and to-day there
are not more than 900,000 survivors. Every
encampment sees face* missing. There can
not be, in the order of things, many more en
campments. Every man that was eligible to
be a member of this magnificent organization
was in the army before 1S65. From that time
we have not been able to recruit. We have
had no sources to draw from. There will soon
come a time when only a remnant of a once
grand organization will remain. In a few
years the Grand Army will be a memory.
Notwithstanding these drawbacks you will
have at least calculation 50,000 visitors in this
city. They are coming from all parts of the
United States, and this encampment will be a
memorable one.

General Stewart said his trip was de
lightful. All along the route he^waa ac
corded receptions, though he tried to avoid
them. A stop was made at Albuquerque.
At the city of New Mexico the general
was met by the 'department commander
and by leading members of the organiza
tion. A campfire was held outside the
hotel and many speeches were delivered.
On Saturfiay' the general and party
stopped at Los Angeles. They spent the
day in sightseeing. On hi3 arrival In this
city to-night the general held a levee in
the corridors of the Palace. Scores of
comrades whom he has not seen In years
grasped his hand, and veterans from all
parts of the Union were Introduced to him.
In speaking about the convention, which
convenes Thursday morning, the com
mander stated that It would be an inter
esting one. He said many new laws would
probably be adopted and legislation touch
ing various sections would be regulated.
What that legislation will be he would not

ment and would have to be presented to

The general committee of the O. A. R.
Encampment urges upon all merchants
and persons occupying premises in the
business part of the city to afford ac
commodation of their stores to the visit
ors, and more especially to the ladies ac
companying the veterans. There is a lack
of public accommodation stations in this
cityâ unknown perhaps In any other city
of equal size and importance. With the
exception of the one recently constructed
at the east side of Union Square, there la
no place of public convenience in this
city, and in the present emergency, when
our city is crowded with strangers, it be
hooves our retail merchants to afford vis
itors every accommodation possible.

Every hotel and rooming-house in San
Francisco is reported to be taxed to -the
capacity and hundreds of the veterans and
their friends will' be accommodated to-day

j The mass of work with which the execu
tive and reception committees have had
to contend with for many weeks is near
ing completion and all concerned hope
that this morning will find everything la
good running order.
The finishing touches to the arches at
Third and Market streets will be made
this morning and the street decorations
will then be complete. Thousands of peo
ple*thronged the streets last evening and
witnessed the trial of the electric decora
tions. They are without doubt the most
effective ever seen in San Francisco and
are bound to evoke the plaudits of the
multitude during the week.
Chief of Police Wittman yesterday is
sued his orders to the Police. Department
for the week of the encampment. Every
precaution will be taken for the safety
and comfort of the crowds of visitors. On

KANSAS CITY. Aufc. 16.-Notwithstand-
Ing the fact that the Kansas River at
this point had risen a foot In the twenty
four hours up to 2 o'clock this afternoon,
when It became stationary, and that a
further rise is expected to-morrow, no
great damage is likely to result. West of
here, at Lawrence arid Topeka, the Kan
sas .River has risen slightly since last
night and at Sallna and Junction City its
tributaries, the Smoky Hill and Republi
can rivers, are rising at a steady rate and
sending their water this way. Most of
this water will reach Kansas City within
another twenty-four hours, but while a
further two-foot rise Is predicted, a fall
from that time on is looked for.
Traffic between the two Kansas Citys
is . still suspended, as the temporary pile
bridges are unsafe. A sand scow broke
away to-day, striking the James-street
bridge, the principal outlet between the
two cities, knocking several plies loose
and rendering that structure unsafe for
street cars or vehicles. At the Belt Line
bridge the current was so swift that it
became necessary to remove a section of
the bridge to let the great mass of drift
wood through. Fearing a temporary
abandonment of some of the railroad
yards in the lower part of the bottom%.
the Swift Packing Company moved se^j
eral tons of provisions to this side of thfe
river to-day. The water must reach flÂ£
teen f eÂ«Â»t before it can reach the plant
or the business houses, however, and this
ia not at all likely. ' .. HW
FALL OF WATER IN KANSAS
RIVER IS EXPECTED SOON
til the sun had disappeared beyond the
horizon.
"Yes, sah." remarked the man from the
Northwest, In accents pronouncedly
Southern, to a Call reporter, "I was on
the other side and -had a lot of fighting
to do. I live 'way up in Washington and
when I heard that the Grand Army chaps
were going to meet here, I quietly said to
myself that I'd go down to 'Frisco and
see some of the fellbws that were plump
ing lead at us back In the sixties. I put
on the gray clothes because I wanted to
get acquainted, and I knew that when
these chaps saw me coming they would
be pretty nigh keen enough to learn who
I was, and wo would have a good time
making up over our old troubles. ; ;i ;
OLD SORES HAVE HEALED.
"The war's over and we are all broth
ers and sisters again, ain't we, com
rades?"âand a chorus of voices respond
ed with "You bet."
"See that fellow over there?", suddenly
exclaimed Heater, pointing to a Union
veteran wearing a yeljow badge of In
diana's delegation, "I'll be dâ d if he
ain't one of the fellows who captured me
and a lot of our brigade in '61. It was
the First Indiana Cavalry. Say, old man,
I spent an hour blazing away at your
crowd, and If half of the bullets my gun
belched that day reached the mark I must
have killed a hundred of you.
"But," added Heater, rather thought
fully, "I guess they didn't. At any rate,
I hope they didn't. Wai, sah, on May 20,
'64, the Eighteenth Pennsylvania - In
fantry got me again, and do you know,
they came nigh keeping me fo' good, sah!"
âand as Heater's mind reverted to the in
cident' of forty years ago he glanced
slowly around him, scanning the features
of his newly made gray-haired acquaint
ances and added: "Well, : boys, we're all
getting pretty close to the grave. It's too
bad we ever fought as fiercely as we did,
g + j* OHN W. HEATER, sah,
â¢ â¢ M Thirty-first Virginia, Pe-
M gram's Brigade, Early's Di
mj vision, Jackson's Corps, and
a good one, sah. Line up
there on the left. Now, what shall it be?
Whisky? Good! Here's to you all, sah."
A gurgling sound, followed by a smack-
Ing of lips, and then fourteen men in
blue, preceded by a stalwart man in gray,
filed out of the liquoring place and reas
sembled around the veteran of Pegram's
Brigade.
It was an eventful day for John W.
Heater, a typical Southern soldier, dressed
in the Confederate gray, hailing from the
State of Washington, and eagerly search
ing for 6ome of the men who, in these
trying days, when lead poured into tho
ranks 'of the opposing forces and death
reaped an hourly harvest, kept him on
the move on the field of Gettysburg.
Heater has come to San Francisco to
witness the reunion of veterans. He has
forgotten the prejudices of the past and
yesterday he mingled with the men of the
Northern armies and received from them
assurance of good will, which he returned
in kind, and over the bar of the Grand
Hotel united with his former foes in
drinking to the health of a great and
glorious nation.
WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
In his familiar gray uniform, fresh from
a tailor's shop, a black slouch hat with
gilded tassel and bearing a ribbon upon
which Is inscribed in gold letters: "3lst
Virginia, Pegram's Brigade, Early's Di
vision, Jackson's Corps, '61-'64," the tall
figure of. Heater was most conspicuous
around the gathering places of the Union
veterans yesterday, and more so because
the latter, recognizing In the visitor a.
"Johnnie," from south of the line, eagerly
surrounded him and kept him in tow un-
"Amen," solemnly shouted a veteran
from Maryland, and the hero of Jack
son's Corps again marshalled his forces
before the bar for another drink.
On every side Heater was the recipient
of cordial greetings and frequently he
would meet an old soldier who would re
call some Incident of the war that would
precipitate an argument as to the merits
of the ppposlng armies, but it was a good
natured controversy and Invariably ended
in what will' undoubtedly prove undying
friendship between John Heater and j the
man with whom he engaged In counter
talk of the war long passed.
About 3 o'clock in the afternoon, while
Heater, standing In the midst of a gath
ering of old soldiers on New Montgomery
street, was describing some of the inci
dents of the battle of Gettysburg, and
was telling of his capture, " he was sud
denly grabbed by two Union men, who
shouted. "Throw down your gun. Johnnie,
you're taken!"â a*nd they rushed the tall
man from Washington out into the street.
One of the captors was R. M. Green of
this city, formerly of the Eighty-fifth
Ohio, the other Dr. R. M. Stewart lof the
Fifty-fifth Ohio, a resident of Kansas
City.
"Well, by gosh! If this don't beat the
drum. It was the boys of the Eighty
fifth and the Fifty-fifth that peppered us
so hard Just before Gettysburg. Golly!. but
I'm pleased to meet you," and again the
Heater brigade was deployed along the
bar.
. John Heater was the hero of the day.
HERO OF THE DAY.
A mighty good lot of chaps died on those
rough fields of battle. God bless them all,
and may we here thank God that we're
good friends again."
At that moment Colonel Currier was
crossing the room toward the speaker
and heard him say: "I was with Cap
tain Currier at the battle of Poplar Spring
Church. September 30. 1864. when he was
shot, the bullet going through his face.
I saw him fall and carried him off the
battlefield." Colonel Currier promptly
made himself known and the meeting that
followed was very pathetic. The visitor
who was looking for Colonel Currier Is
G. T. Ordway of Redlands. California,
where he owns an orange grove and Is
one of the leading citizens of his com
munity.
A pathetic incident occurred yesterday
when Colonel J. C. Currier met for thÂ©
first time, after thirty-nine years, the
man who carried him off the battlefield
of Poplar Spring Church near Petersburg.
Va. * Colonel Currier sauntered Into the
headquarters of the department of New
Hampshire, Palace Hotel. A vl3itlng vet
eran was seated, registering his name.
While registering he asked the comrades
near him whether any of them knew Cap

to locate him.
Comrades Meet After Many Years.
In the National Cemetery at Arlington
there is a burial plat presented to Rand
by the Government, and although it will
probably not be occupied for several years
at least, it will eventually mark the last
resting place of a man who, by his readi
ness to serve his country In time of trou
ble, lent inspiration to a cause that must
ever remain illustrious in human history.
: It was on the afternoon of April 13, 1S61,
that young Rand, then an 18-year-old
clerk, serving at Batavia, N. T., attended
a meeting at the old Eagle Tavern, where
there was a heated discussion in progress
over the possibilities of war. In the midst
of the debate a townsman suddenly
rushed into the tavern waving a telegram
over his head and shouting: "The Presi
dent has called for 75,000 men to go for
ward and fight!"
Henry I. Glowacki. who was presiding
at the meeting, took the message, and
hurriedly reading it. exclaimed to his
anxious fellow-citizens: "We have to
raise our quota to fill this call. Who will
be the first man to enlist?"
"I will." came a voice from the center
of the tavern, and. turning their heads,
the assembled people saw young Rand rise
from his -seat and proceed toward the
speaker's chair.
On a quickly Improvised roll Rand hur
riedly affixed his signature and with the
scratching of his pen he gave to the
Twelfth New York Volunteers their first
recruit and to New York State the dis
tinction of furnishing the first volunteer
for the Civil War.
Batavia was not slow In raising Its
quota, and not long after Rand was n
the midst of battle. Later, for a daring
act, Congress awarded him a medal of
honor, the first ever presented by Con
gress for distinguished gallantry on the
battlefield.
Among the advance guard of the Army
of the Potomac contingent, which arrived
early yesterday from Washington, was a
no less notable/ person than Charles F.
Rand, who proudly bears the distinction,
fully attested by Congressional inquiry,
of being the first man to enlist in the War
of the Rebellion.
First Volunteer of Civil War Is
Here.
WEARS AN HONOR MEDAL.
Though Once Foes,

as Friends.
Captain Loeffler is accompanied by" his
wife and daughter. This is their first
trip to California and they are delighted
with the State. Yesterday afternoon they
paid a visit to Golden Gate Park and the
Cliff House.
Captain Loeffler entered the army three
years before the Civil War. He was at
tached to the Second Cavalry Regiment
and first saw service in Texas. At the
breaking out of the war he was detailed at
headquarters at Washington and with the
rank of captain his duty was the bearing
of important dispatches from the front to
Washington. The work was irksome and
dangerous and he asked his regimental
commander to allow him to return
to his regiment and fight at the
front. The request was refused,
however, as Adjutant General John
Seth stated that he was too valuable a
man and could not be relieved.
In answer to the question as to which
of the Presidents he liked best, the cap
tain said that he had no preference. He
spoke cordially of all the Presidents and
said that they had all treated him with
kindness. ;'i -. "**â¢
In discussing his position yesterday at
the Occidental. Captain Loeffler said that
he had charge of all callers at the White
House and that it was his duty to see
that they receive proper attention. He re
marked that once In a while a religious
crank or a man with imaginary wrongs
would call at the White House and ask
to see the President, but that they came
few and far between and were of little
bother.
Captain Loeffler was appointed as door
keeper at the Whi^e House in March. 1863,
a few days after President Grant took
his oath of office. Two years and a half
ago Captain Loeffler reached the age of
sixty-four years and was forced to retire
from the active army list, and a special
act was passed in Congress to make pro
vision for the captain and his office as
door keeper, and a provision reads that
he shall hold office until relieved by the
President.
ter, known from one end of the
continent to the other, as for the last
thirty-four years he has held the respon
sible position of door keeper for the Presi
dent of the United States at the White
House at Washington.

ADMIRE DECORATIONS.
For the next twenty-four hours every
train that enters this city either at Oak
land or at Third and Townsend streets
will contain veterans who are coming to
this encampment. The railroad company
has made every arrangement for the
speedy transit of the soldiers and it Is ex
pected that every special now on the road
will be here not later than this evening.
Many favorable comments have been
heard on the streets from the visitors.
Although the decorations In their honor
have not been completed they express the
opinion that they have never seen any
thing to equal them. They are awaiting
eagerly for the night Illumination. The
thousands of globes glittering in the sun
light had attracted their attention and
they marvel at the number used to Illu
minate the streets.
every hour yesterday
trains bearing members of the
m^F Grand Army of the Republlo
â¢^ A end their families rolled into the
depot at Oakland pier. Wearied
by their long ride on the cars, but eager
to reach their destination, the veterans
marched on to the terry boats and en-
Joyed the ride on the bay. The weather
was Ideal and the visitors were charmed
with their first view of the city and Its
surroundings. The old soldiers were laden
with valises and grips. On their breasts
they wore the badge of honor aud printed
badges telling from whet State they
hailed.
Committees from thÂ© local posts met the
veterans cm both sides of the bay and
directed them to their hotels and abiding
places. In the Ferry building a committee
on registration toiled all dey. The visi
tors were assigned to rooms and directed
without loss of time.
The ecenes at the pier in Oakland and
in the grand nave of the Union Depot
were pathetic and many eyes were
dimmed with tears. Old comrades met
for the first time since the war and
brothers clasped hands of brothers and
sisters greeted brothers. Hand clasps
and embraces were numerous. Loud ex
clamations of Joy at seeing a dear one
were followed by anxious inquiries; about
the folks at home. .
PERRY-BOATS CROWDED.
The ferry boats were crowded to their
utmost capacity. Besides the visitors,
hundreds of residents took advantage of
the delightful day to cross to either side.
No accidents marred the day.
The trair.s. as were expected, were be
hind time. The train dispatcher at the
Oakland pier had a large force of men
at work and the air vibrated with the in.
cessar.t clicking of telegraph machines,
fiection followed section into the depot.
Every half hour the trains rolled in. The
cars, after being emptied, wers immedi
ately Fide-tracked and will remain on
the sidings until the visitors are ready
to return home. Within twenty-four
hours as many trains came in. Delega
tions came from all parts of the Union.
The veterans looked wan and worn and
dusty. Some were feeble- and pome car
ried heavy canes for assistance. There
were hundreds of the jrrizzled com
rades who were feeble and every one was
eager to help them along. Willing hands
assisted them up the steps leading to
the boat and carried heavy valises and
every kindness was shown them. True
California hospitality is being extended
the soldiers and they are delighted at the
v.armth of their welcome.
The first train to arrive yesterday was
a special from Connecticut. In the party
na? ex-Governor Morgan G. Bulkeley,
who is the department commander.
The party consisted of 150 men. The
tattered flasrs which were borne so
proudly in the front ranks of battle
were guarded jealously by the color-ser
peants. They were encased in leather
and the blood-stained and bullet-pierced
'mblems, which were followed by the
brave defenders of the Union, will be un
furled to the breeze Wednesday when the
big_ parade of the Grand Army is to be
held in this city.
The Connecticut veterans came here in
f.ne style. They had eight Pullman cars
and a diner attached. They nad a good
time across the continent and came
through without accident.
DELEGATION FROM IOWA.
The Iowa delegation arrived early in
th.* morning. They were greeted on their
arrival by Sergeant J. Brady, Corporal
Charles Rehn, Privates James Edwards,
J. Arling. L. Levy. Hanna, C. J. Smith
and Musician Alfred Ames, Veterans of
the Spanish War. A large delegation of
the young veterans went up the road and
boarded all the trains for the purpose of
registering the visitors and directing them
to find their hotels and giving all the in
formation they needed.
The Iowa special contained ten cars,
which were crowded. More than 200 vet
erans and their families came on this
train.
In the afternoon the Vermont contin
gent arrived. They were represented by
194 veterans, headed by Frank Kentfield,
the department commander. The latter
has surrounded himself with his aids and
other officers of the department. Ten del
egates to the National Convention are
with him. They have no choice for com
mander in chief and come here unpledged.
In the party were George W. Kenney.

Commissioner Ware Gives Interest
ing Statistics of His Bureau.
United States Commissioner of Pensions
E. F. Ware arrived here yesterday from
Washington, D. C, and is registered at
the California. He is here to attend the
National Encampment and will no doubt
be a prominent figure at the many meet
ings. In an Interview last evening he
gave many interesting statistics of the
Pension Bureau.
"The United States Pension Bureau han
dled more business last year than any
thing approaching it in the last ten
years," he said. "We handled 100,000 -old
cases and there are still 304,000 pensions
that have to be decided upon. In the
Pension Bureau there is a clerical force
of 1500, and the field force, that is, doc
tors and others all over the United States,
makes 5000 more.
"Ten years asro there were 1,000.000 pen
sioners. There are 3000 less now. I think
from this time on the pensioners will
gradually diminish. The death rate is
42.2 per year to the 1000. The amount
now paid annually in pensions and in run
ning: the office is $142,000,000. There are
eighteen different agents who distribute
eubagents throughout the United States.
Two agencies in the East alone pay out
to 100,000 pensioners. On the Pacific Coast
the pension office is located In San Fran
cisco, and at the suggestion of Agent
Fuller the pensioners of Hawaii, the Phil
ippines and Alaska are paid in the San
Francisco office.
"We have 9200 pensioners as a result of
the Spanish War and 3662 widows to care
for. There were in all 75.003 applications
from former soldiers and widows and
there are now 3000 cases pending."

â *-Tyndall's Lecture.
An Interesting lecture was given at
Steinway Hall last evening by Dr. Alex.
J. Mclvor-Tyndall. He took for his sub
ject "The Mastery of Fate," and dealt
with the problem of inherited conditions.
He quoted the achievements of Luther
Burbank, who has been called "the wiz
ard of horticulture," In defense of his
theory that because a person has been
born with disadvantages it does not fol
low that he must forever remain a victim
to what he erroneously terms his "fate."
Just as Mr. Burbank has been ' able to
cultivate and Improve a common weed
until it has finally blossomed into a beau
tiful flower, so, he claims, the human
weed can become an individual of power
and purpose. This he believes can be
accomplished through the purposes of
cultivation and selection of thought
power.

Corbett took the cheering modestly and
would have remained silent had not his

repeated and calls for a speech were
heard on every side. \Finally the big man
consented to appear and after being in
troduced by Stage Manager Harry Orn
dorff, appeared on the stage.
Corbett stood smiling as the audience
applauded and shouted. Finally a voice
from the gallery asked him to approach
the center of the stage. This was the
Callfornian's cue. "I do not think I be

afterward.
SAILOR IS KILLED
BY BLOW ON THE HEAD
But he brightened as the stage bullets
began to fly and brave warriors from tha
Presidio poured shot into unseen rebels.
"The old gentleman's smile was a. bit
tremulous as he replied simply: "They
wouldn't have me."
While It was being set the old gentle
man told how he had enlisted at 16â"be
ing a husky boy, and them not being too
particular those times if you half-way
looked the IS you had to swear to." He
was looking forward also to meeting here
an old comrade whom he had not seen for
forty-one years. "Do you think you'll
know one another?" 1 asked. "Don't know.
We don't look just the same as we did
then," and the veteran shook his head.
"Seventeen years ago we â¢ had our' last
encampment in San Francisco," he went
on. "Seventeen years more and some of
us will be setting, rather .'old-', to ''travel."
"Not you, I'm sure." I said. Then asked:
"You went to Cuba?"
/, "A good deal," said the old war dog.
"Butâ wait for the next actâ there's the
fighting!" This remark, of course, pre
luded the third act.
"Stripped, 'em." he said.
"Does the play remind you at all of
that time?" I asked, realizing what a
thing of vivid life even the single word
"Shenandoah" means to one of the bat
tle-anointed.
"What do those signals mean?" I asked
as the lights began to flash from Three
Top Mountain.
"Oh, we didn't understand' 'em: those
were the rebels' ' signals," he explained.
Then, as a prisoner was brought on and
subjected to the usual stage search for
dispatches the old gentleman chuckled
and said: "That wasn't the way we used
to search men in those days."
"But how?" I queried.
"That fellow knows his business," he
began, nodding toward the unseen bugler.
"Yes, I was at Shenandoah, and there are
about twenty others of us In the house
to-night. I was with Cuvier Grover. The
enemy came across that creek yonder,"
Indicating the stream In the middle of
the painted valley on the back scene, "in

"There wasn't anything of that kind,"
he went on, with a genial smile at the
lovers just then occupying the stage.
"Why, the women spat In our faces, poor
things."
"You were there," I said at last to the
brave old figure at my side. It was at
"Shenandoah," at the California last
night, and luck had placed me next to
one of the survivors of Cedar Creek. The
old warrior, bravely badged and medaled,
had stood it as long as he could, but at
the rousing calls of the bugle he turned
sheerly toward me and smiled his desire
"to tell about" it.

AT CALIFORNIA
Senator Gorman, since his return from
Europe, has persistently refused to dis
cuss financial questions .which may be
brought up in Congress. But some of his
friends have been talking for him, be
cause they do not wish him to be placed
In the attitude of opposing any measure
financial questions, Senator Ar
thur P. Gorman, the leader of the Democ
racy in Congress and its possible candi
date for the Presidency, will not be found
among those members of the minority
making factious opposition to remedial
legislaticm ; Indeed, It Is altogether proba
ble that before the extra session convenes
Senator Gorman will call a conference of
the minority leaders and urge them to
abandon their attitude of opposing any
thing and everything in the way of finan
cial measures proposed by the majority
party.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON, Aug. 16.
âWhen the United States Senate
again plunges into a discussion of
"Bravo!" he said, "I've seen 'Shenan
doah" done lots of times, but never a bet
ter fight than that!"
"Were you dressed like that?" I asked,
recalling some unholy incongruities of cos
tume among the feminine members of the
cast.
"Oh, I told some of the boys to-day they
ought to take' oft their blouses," the old
gentleman replied. "We used^to take off
our shirts."
Then as General Sheridan gaily rode In
on his black horse, the veteran confided
to me â In a whisper, so as not to hurt the
mimic Sheridan's feelingsâ that "He ain't
like Sheridan."
With the old soldier I also believe that
the fight's the thing in "Shenandoah."
It is an excellent bit of stage manage
ment, rank on rank of soldiers, and no
lack of powder. It Is a blessed relief
from the usual super horror and in itself
worth seeing. The cast is well suited in
its parts, in particular as to Charles
Wyngate, Frank MacVlcars, ' Thomas
Oberle and E. Gardiner Jones; Lillian
Kemble and Elsie Esmond. Miss Kath
erine Oilman, a charming young Cali
fornian who will be heard from some day,
made a modest and successful debut as
Jenny Buckthorne.
The house was enormous and generous
of its plaudits.

his staff will attend the performance.

that may abate or remove the present
financial Ills simply because It has been
proposed by members of the opposite
party. Senator Gorman was not alto
gether In sympathy with the members of
his party who talked to death the Aidrich
bill last March. There were features of
that measure which he did not approve,
but the manner In which it yas finally
disposed of he did not think" dignified or
was entirely advantageous to the Demo
crats. Neither is he in sympathy with
what appears to be the attitude of Sena
tors Daniel, Teller and Money In the pres
ent agitation. Mr. Gorman thinks that if
the question of politics Is to enter into it
at all it will be far better for the Democ
racy if the Republican leaders go before
the country as having failed to agree
among themselves on the desired legisla
tion than of having failed to muster suffi
cient strength to pass It. Any aggressive
action on the part of the Democrats to op
pose legislation in embryo or to adopt ob
structive tactics, as waa done last winter,
the Senator does not consider neither
statesmanship nor politics,

The President concluded by referring
briefly to the Civil War and touching on
patriotism. The applause at the conclu-
Elon of his address was enthusiastic and
the cheering: continued until he had en
tered his carriage and been driven away.
We have good scriptural authority for the
statement that it is not what comes into a
man's mouth, but what goes out of it that
count*. I am not addressing weaklings or I
should r.ot take the trouble to come here. I
am addressing strong, vigorous men. who are
engaged tn the active hard work of life, and
life to be worth living must be a life of ac
tivity and hard work. I am speaking to
men engaged in the hard, active work of life
end therefore, men who will count for good or
for evil, and it is particularly incumbent upon
you who have strength to set a right exam
ple to others. I ask you to remember that you
â¢-ennot retain your Â«elf-respect if you are loose
and foul of tongue, that a man who is to lead
a clean and honorable life must inevitably suf
fer if his speech likewise is not clean and
honorable. Every man here knows the tempta
tions that. beset all of us in this world. At
times anv man may clip. I do not expect
r-erfect-ion. but 1 do expect genuine and fin
cere effort toward being decent and cleanly
in thought, in word and in deed.
Just as I was driving up here a friend who
was with us taid that in his experience the
boy who went out into life with a foul tongue
was apt Â«o to go because his kinsfolk, at
";â¢ a--t his intimate associates themselves, had
a foul tongue. But while the life in the fam
ily cannot do everything, while the associa
tions or friendships cannot do everything, still
the friends the father, the elder brothers, can
do most toward seeing the boys as they be
come men become clean and honorable men.
I have told you that I wanted you not only
to be decent but to be strong. The boys are
not going to admire virtue that Is of a purely
anaemic type. They believe in courage, in
manliness. They admire those who have the.
quality of being brave, the quality of facing
life as life should be faced, the quality that
rr.ust stand at the root of good citizenship In
peace or in war. If you are to be effective as
good Christians you have sot to possess
strength and courage, or your example will
count tor lUtle with the young, who admire
strength and courage.
OYSTER BAr.N. Y., Aug. 16.âPresi
dent Roosevelt delivered the principal ad
dress at the quarterly meeting of the So
ciety of the Holy Name of Brooklyn and
Long Island, held here to-aay. "Decency
of Speech and Conduct" constituted the
theme of his address, which was enthusi
astically applauded by an audience of
more than 2000 persons, mostly men.
During the afternoon special trains
brought hundreds of members of the soci
ety to Oyster Bay from. Brooklyn and
Western Long Island. Threatening
weather kept many away, but although a
light rain fell durinc the exercises the
crowd remained banked about the flag
decked stand on a beautiful hill opposite
St. Dominick's Catholic Church.
As President Roosevelt drove up to the
stand in a closed carriage, accompanied by
Captain W. H. Brownson, superintendent
of the Naval Academy, Secretary Barnes
and a representative of the society, he
was accorded an enthusiastic reception.
a band meanwhile playing "Hall to the
Chief."
.After the audience had sung "Amer
ica" Father Power, rector of St. Domi
r.lck's, introduced the President in a felic
itous speech in which he spoke of the es
teem in which Mr. Roosevelt is held by
the Catholics of this country.
When President Roosevelt rose he was
greeted with prolonged cheers and It was
a full minute before he was able to pro
ceed. He said:
Very Reverend Dean. Reverend Clergry and
You of the Holy Name" Society: I count my
self fortunate in havlnr the chance to say
a word to you to-day, and at the outset let
ir.e. Father Power, on behalf of my neighbors,
your congregation, welcome you here to Oyster
Bay. 'I h*ve a partial right to Join in that
welcome myself, tor it was my good fortune
in the da,ys of Father Power's predecessor.
Father Belford. to be the first man to put
down a pmall contribution for the erection of
the church h^re. 1 am particularly glad to
see *uch a society as this flourishing, as your
society has flourished, because the future wel
fare of our nation dejtende upon the way in
which we can combine in our men. in our
young men â decency and strength. Just this
rooming when attending service on the great
battleship Ktarsarge. I listened to a sermon
addressed to the of fleers and enlisted men of
the navy, in which the central thought was
that each American must be a good man or
he could not be a good citizen. And one of
the things dwelt upon In that sermon was the
fact that a man must be clean of mouth as
well as clean of life â must show by his words
ag well as by his actions his fealty to the
Deity and the Savior If he is to be what we
have* a right to expect of men wearing the
national uniform.
The outdoor and Indoor attractions at
the Chutes are numerous and * enter
taining. There are five baby lions sport
ing in the zoo.
The Central Theater programme for this
week consists of the Civil War drama,
"Cumberland '61," which is billed as a
special Grand Army attraction.
The merry extravaganzas, "Quo Vass
Iss" and "The Big Little Princess," still
hold the bill at Fischer's Theater.
The rustic play, entitled "The Dairy
Farm," will be given at the Alcazar
Theater to-night by a cast which includes
Oza Waldrop, Edward Davis, Juliet Cros

Hartley and Theodore T. Rook, who ap
peared in the play during its run in the
East.
At the Tivoli Opera House CamUle

At the Grand Opera House Raymond

bills and her versatility is of a character
never seen before by a San Erancisco
audience. Last night Mlsa Fay changed
some of her work, but the substitutions
are as good as the work of last week. The
only anticipation that the audlence.did not
realize was the baby song that was sung
last week, as perhaps few other women
on the stage could sing It.
John Le Clalr as an artistic comedy
juggler is a master in his line. He did
work that is new in the city and his tricks
with* billiard balls were marvelous. Rosle
Rendel, England's eccentric ' transforma
tion dancer, took the house by storm. She
has a good voice and her toe dancing was
above the average. Heeley and Meely are
comedians, acrobats' and jugglers of the
highest order, and received a great recep
tion. Sidney Wilmer and company appear
in a comedy sketch, "A Strange -Baby,"
and are Just as popular. Miss Wynne
Winslow, soprano, and Lew Hawkins,
"the Chesterfield of minstrelsy," repeat
excellent holdover acts, and â¢- the great
Kaufmann Troupe of bicyclists continue
in their wonderful act.
Provision Is made for a Bertillion record
of; all Chinese laborers arriving and de
parting at ports of entry, copies of such
registry to be transmitted to the Commis
sioner General of Immigration.
Conditions are prescribed to which all
Chinese persons claiming the right of
transit through the United States to for
eign territory must conform as, a condi
tion preceding such privilege. Numerous
changes have been .necessary In the revi
sion of these rules to make them conform
to the transfer of Jurisdiction over the
subject from the Treasury Department to
the Department of Commerce and Labor.
Forms of blanks are prescribed and rules
made to govern the officers charged with
the enforcement of the exclusion laws.
WASHINGTON, Aug.- 16.â A. new set of
Chinese regulations, prepared by 'commis
sioner General of Immigration - Sargent
and approved by Secretary Cortelyou of
the Department of Commerce and Labor,
jurisdiction of the matter of the exclu
sion 6f Chinese having been transferred
from the Treasury to the latter depart
ment, were made public to-day and are
now ready for distribution. These rules

which Chinese, other than Chinese dip
lomatic and consular officers, may land
and, name the officers who have been vest

Chinese unlawfully within the United
States are included. All told, there* are
sixty-one rules embraced In the new regu
lations. Accompanying the regulations
are laws and treaties relating to the ex
clusion of Chinese.
One serious loss was the destruction of
hundreds of bales of hennequln and cot
ton which were on the docks at Progreso
ready for shipment.
Little by little the wind increased, and
soon it was tearing up great trees by the
roots, blowing roofs away and destroying
houses ahd plantations. Great damage
was done in a very short time.
Naturally the hurricane was more terri
ble along the coast. ,Grcat efforts were
made to save small vessels, but to no
avail, and twenty of those lying In , the
port of Progreso were cast upon the
shore. â¢
MERIDA, Yucatan, Aug. 18.â The ef
fects of the tropical cyclone in this city
and Progreso were widespread and ter
rible. The wind commenced in the early
hours of the night and, although every
body had been prepared for the gale, in
consequence of warnings given some time
beforehand, panic Quickly seized the
community.
OYSTER BAT, N. Y., Aug. 16.â With the
North Atlantic fleet anchored oft Oyster
Bay, this has been almost a fete day on
the bay and sound. Hundreds of pleas
ure craft hovered about the fleet through
out the day, notwithstanding the weather
was threatening.
Official formalities were begun at 9
o'clock this morning, when Rear Admifal
Barker, accompanied by Captain Hemp
hill of the Kearsarge and Flag Lieuten
ant Eberle, went in a barge to the Dol
phin to pay his respects .to Secretary of
the Navy Moody. An hour lifter Secre
tary Moody, accompanied by former Sec
retary Chandler, returned the visit. They
remained to attend divine service.
When Admiral Barker was Informed
that the President also would attend the
service, orders were issued at once for all
Officers to appear in special full dress.
Shortly before 11 o'clock President
Roosevelt arrived on the Kearsarge from
the naval yacht Sylph. As he came over
the side of the Kearsarge the band was
paraded, the marines presented arms, the
bugle sounded a fanfare and the drums
gave four ruffles. Then the band played,
"Hail to the Chief." as Admiral Barker
received the President on the quarter
deck.
A few minutes later a launch from the
Sylph conveyed to the Kearsarge a party,
including the President's family and Cap
tain Willard H. Brownson, superintendent
of the Naval Academy. The divine ser
vice was conducted by Chaplain Isaacs,
whose sermon was particularly addressed
to the officers and men. of the ship. His
especial theme was that the man who
served his country best was he who also
served God.
At the conclusion of the service the
President and Secretary Moody casually
inspected some parts of the ship. The
President then received Rear Admirals
Wise, Sands and Coghlan, who had come
from their flagships to pay their respects.
Mrs. Roosevelt and the other ladles were
shown over the ship.
When the President left the Kearsarge
at 1 o'clock the sides of all the ships were
again manned and every honor was paid
except the firing of the salute, which was
omitted because his visit was unofficial
and was made on a Sunday.
At 5 o'clock Sir Thomas Lipton, on
board his steam yacht Erin, passed the
fleet. Sir Thomas stood on the bridge and
saluted each ship as he went by. He will
be the guest of President Roosevelt on
the Mayflower to-morrow.
At the conclusion of the review to-mor
row the battleships Kearsarge, Illinois
and Alabama will go seaward at full
speed, which they wyi maintain until
they reach Race Rock, at the eastern en
trance of Long Island Sound.
It is understood that the first division
of the torpedo-boat destroyers, composed
of the Decatur, Bainbridge, Barry, Dale
and Chauncey. under command of Lieu
tenant Lloyd H. Chandler, son of the for
mer Secretary of the Xavy, after the
maneuvers of the summer, which will be
concluded on the 29th inst., will proceed
to the Asiatic station, via the Suez canal.
The cruiser Chicago, which has Just ar
rived from Europe, joined the fleet to-day
and will participate in the review.

It is said h'ere that Count Lamsdorf ,
the Russian Foreign Minister, advised
Mme. Rostkovski, widow of the mur
dered Consul at Monastir, to accept the
$80,000 Indemnity offered her by the Porte
and which she refused, declaring that she
did not want Turkish charity.
A Belgrade dispatch to the Neues Wel

A number of Greeks and Wallachians,
who joined the insurgents under threats,
have gone over to the Turkish troops.
Official information saya that the In

their arms and been pardoned.
The Times correspondent at Constanti

murderer of Rostkovski has greatly in
censed the lower classes in Monastlr. The
foreign Consuls there have been provided
with military escorts and their houses
are guarded. by Turkish soldiers.

By this and other similar acts the Ottoman
administration can be Judged. What must be
the result of all this? Tired of awaiting the
fulfillment of promises of better conditions and
driven to despair, the Bulgarian population
has thrown itself into a revolution, which is
now spreading in an Ottoman province 150
miles from the Bulgarian frontier. The causes
of this revolution are to-day known. The re
sponsibility is fixed and the Porte can no
longer accuse the Bulgarian principality.
The memorandum has made a strong
impression in diplomatic circles. The
Austrian diplomatic agent has already
called upon the Premier" to express his
anxety regarding the results that may
ensue from its publication. The French
and Italian agents also expressed uneasi
ness, although they took a less gloomy
view*
o . I .. I ..t.. I ,. : ..|.. I .. I .. I .. I ,. I .. I ..H, H . I .. I .. I .. I .. I .. I .^.
Not only has the Porte failed to observe- a
single one of the promises, but' it has en
acted sterner measures of repression. To give
only one example: It is prescribed as a condi
tion of release that a Bulgarian prisoner must
furnish financial or personal security, but in
the latter case the surety must be by a Turk
ish â¢ subject of non-Bulgarian origin. It is
easy to comprehend that the imprisoned Bul
garians find it impossible to obtain release un
der such conditions.
Not Ions ago the Porte denounced these rev
olutionary movements as being: fomented by
Bulgaria and tried to put the responsibility
on this principality. To-day it must ac
knowledge that it is its. bad administration
which is the only cause for the trouble. From
sad experiences the Porte must learn that
cruel injustice and bloody repression do not
restore order and peace in a country.
Lastly, the Porte formally promised the Bul
garian Government to cease the arrests of Bui
garian priests and schoolmasters, reopen the
churches and schools. . release the prisoners and
punish the officials guilty of exactions; in
short, to adopt a policy of Justice and amelior
ation.
In conclusion, the memorandum asserts
that the foregoing exposure once more
condemns Ottoman administrative gov
ernment in Europe. It says:
Encouraged by the Ottoman authorities,
the Greek bishops and archimandrites
forced their way into the Bulgarian
church, burned, the prayer books and em
ployed menaces to compel the people to
acknowledge the patriarch. The archi
mandrite of Salonica declared in a recent
sermon that the Sultan did not want Bul
garian exarches in his empire, and if*they
remained they would be exterminated.
In addition to the decree banishing the
Bulgarian tradesmen from Constantinople
and Salonica, the Porte adopted measures
to ruin the traders elsewhere. The Gov
ernor of Monastir issued an order on April
23 forbidding Bulgarians to go abroad, or
even to Constantinople. This order was
Interpreted to prevent Bulgarians going
to any large city and forcing them to deal
only with the Turkish merchants.
The provincial administration employed
every possible means to install Mussul
mans in the Bulgarian villages. On the
slightest pretext the Bulgarians were
forced to sell their lands to the Turks
at any price the latter chose to pay. Bur
dened with taxes, liable I to perform
statute labor for the Turkish land own
ers, the population is reduced to a state
of serfdom. This is one of the principal
causes of discontent, and, when the ex
actions of the tax gatherers are added,
it is not difficult to understand why the
wretched people should revolt from such
a despotic government and servitude. , .
FACTS CONDEMN THE TTJBK.
PERSECUTION OF CLEBGY.
the memorandum states that the Bulgar
ian merchants living in Constantinople
and Salonica were ordered to return to
their native villages and were hot allowed
any time or opportunity to dispose of their
business and property. Some of these Bul
garians, who with their families had been
established for twenty years or more,
were . utterly ruined. As the order ap
plied equally to professors and school
masters, the Bulgarian schools were
closed before the end of the school year.
The authorities rigorously enforced the
same order against the Bulgarian priests,
making every effort to paralyze the de
velopment of religious and educational
work, depriving the Birigarian patriarch,
of all of his privileges and forcing people
to come under the authority of the Greek
patriarch.
550, a grand total of 2800. As Information
is lacking- from many districts in these
vilayets it is believed that without ex
aggeration the number of prisoners may
be placed at even three times this total.

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 16.â The Rus

repeating the official statement without
comment. The Novoe Vremya, in an out
spoken editorial, says:
Bitter experience has shown the uselessness
and disadvantage of all concerted measures.
Now, since the murder of M. Rostkovski does
not concern Europe, we are proceeding with
out any concert, and, therefore, we can more
confidently predict complete satisfaction for
our demands of Turkey.

The officials here affect ignorance of the

divisions of the Russian Black Sea fleet,
which recently assembled ' for the usual
autumn maneuvers, left Batoum three
days ago and Bome of the vessels will
probably visits ports on the Turkish
Black Sea littoral, as was the case last
year, but the movement has no signifi
cance and they scout the idea of a Rus
sian naval demonstration.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Aug. 16.â The
Ottoman Government has con
cluded negotiations with the
Krupp works for the supply of
Mv mother. Mrs. Goodwin, and I never con
ducted a reading-room in Oakland together or
at any place else. In reference to Schafer not
having knowledge of the divorce, the fact that
his lawyer advised him not to kidnap his chil
dren because he would only get himself in
trouble, but to coax his daughter to go with
him to Oakland and then fight it out in the
courts there. Is sufficient evidence of their
knowledge of the legality of my custody of the
children. But he did not obey, and he took
his daughter forcibly away from her teacher
against her will, as any one who heard her
screams for help can testify. Schafer used his
political pull (as he is doing now in Nebraska)
to work the police of Sacramento, and as he
had done in every city where he supposed I
would locate, and his movements are not now
â¢nd never have been aboveboard. My husband.
Mr. Beck, never figrured In any way In my do
mestic troubles and any assertion to the con
trary Is false.
I went East because be threatened my life,
and also he told my mother that he had every
lawyer and Judge in the county of Alameda
"fixed" so that they would not dare bring a
decision contrary to his wishes, and this later
1 believed firmly, because my suit was post
poned many time against my express wishes.
As for the fraud charged about the Ne
braska divorce, I have ample proof and wit
nesses to prove my allegation of habitual
drunkenness against Schafer. The State law
of Nebraska Is somewhat different in regard
to summons in either civil or divorce case from
the California code, and the law was coirplled
with In every point, as the judgment roll of
the case shows.
The cause of our domestic troubles was
drunkenness and frequent absences from home.
These absences sometimes extended for a
month or more at a time and no excuse waa
ever given for them. The fact that he gam
bled and drank waa no excuse for them to me.
In September, 1901, I commenced a suit for
divorce against Paul J. Schafer in Oakland.
where I then resided, on the grounds of ex
treme cruelty and non-support, as my applica
tion there on Ale will show. Instead of Sehafer
being "the aggrieved party" in this affair. I
moEt certainly am, as I could have brought
suit under all the necessary allegations for di
vorce under the California law save that of
felony. Schafer made no cross-complaint at
this time, which he certainly would have done
bad he such facts as he now claims he had and
now puts forth to the public.
My. divorce was granted on the ground of
habitual drunkenness in Omaha, Nebr., Octo
ber 22. lim'Z. My residence in Nebraska was
bona tide, as I can prove, because I went there
with the avowed purpose of practicing Chris
tian Science, and was going to locate in the
Bee building, Omaha.

PL.ACERVILLE, Aug. 15.â Attorney
Fred Irwin of this city, who has been
camping at Phillip's station, near the
summit, in company with John F. Arm
strong, Register of the United States
I-Â«and Office at Sacramento, returned home
to-day and reported that last Friday
morning three men armed with rifles vis
ited their camp and. stating they had
gone two days without food, asked for
something to cat. The men appeared tired
and exhausted and they were given
breakfast, after which they left taking
eome provisions with them in a sack.
When getting their provisions, the women
and children of the camp gathered round
them to see who they were, and the
strangers suggested that they had better
not get too close to them as a sheriff's
posse might be in the neighborhood and
lire on them. They further stated that
they were escaped convicts and that they
would not intentionally harm any one.
They were extremely courteous to the
campir.g party.
Theron, who was recognized from a pic
ture, caught sight of Register Armstrong,
who in appearance and size somewhat
resembles Sheriff Bosquit, and, clapping
liis hand on his revolver, inquired. "Isn't
that the big sheriff?" He remained sus
jiicious after being told who Armstrong
was, for he kept his eye on Armstrong
until his companions had started off in
the direction of the Glen Alpine trail-
I^ater in the morning a boy named Pen
nick visited Irwin's camp and reported
that he had Feen two armed men a short
distance away. From their appearance
he thought them to be escaped convicts.
The two may have been covering the
camp while their three companions en
tered to get breakfast and provisions. The
oscapes evidently followed the Glen Al
pine trail, for a report was received from
Glen Alpine last night that the convicts
had taken dinner there.

Sheriff Norman Returns to Jackson
With His Man-Hunters.
JACKSON. Aug. 1Câ Sheriff Norman and
Deputy Jackson returned from the con
vict-huntirg expedition yesterday and de
tailed iho facts of their trip. Norman's
posse consisted of twelve men and was
well provisioned. He was the only Sher
iff who took the field after the band of
live convicts excepting one deputy Sheriff
from El Dorado. The other pursuers
were volunteers attracted by a promise
of reward.
Norman says the convicts were never
in Fight at any time, nor was the smoke
at their camptires visible. At Caples Lake
he discovered that they had passed
through a deep gorge which is the outlet
of the lake. He did not attempt to follow
them in the canyon, as the nature of the
country was such, he says, that it would
be like leading his men to certain death.
The first five days the convicts traveled
only fifteen miles. While securing a fresh
tuppjy of provisions and believing that
the outlaws would continue their easy
pace, they slipped by him, making nine
miles one night, heading toward Carson
Valley.
Norman had to bear the expense of the
posse from his own private funds, and
having followed them through two coun
ties, and neither being Amador, he did
not feel Justified, without some volunteer
help, in pursuing them further. He be
lieves the five convicts broke into two
bands after crossing the summit

SOFIA. Bulgaria, Aug. 16.â The Bul
garian Government has presented
a memorandum to the powers, set
ting out at great length the condi-
tion of affairs during the past
three months in Macedonia since the
Turkish Government undertook to insti
tute the promised reforms. The most pre
cise details, dates, places and names of
persons are given in the memorandum)
the whole constituting a terrible category
of murder, torture, incendiarism, pillage
and general oppression committed by the
Ottoman soldiers and officials. These
particulars were obtained entirely from
official circles, such as the representatives
of the Bulgarian Consuls and agents of
the Bulgarian Government, and, in many
instances, the reports made by Turkish
authorities. The Bulgarian Government
guarantees the absolute truth of every
statement and challenges the Porte to* dis
prove a single charge made in the memp
randum.
The memorandum begins by stating that
daring the past three months the'Ottoman
Government has taken a series of meas
ures with the alleged intention of inaugu
rating the era of promised reform and
of assuring peace and tranquillity to the
Bulgarian population of European Tur
key, but which have had the contrary ef
fect of further exasperating this popula
tion and reviving the revolutionary move
ment. Instead of proceeding solely against
persons guilty of breaches of the public
order, the military and civil authorities
have sought every possible pretext to per
secute, terrorize and ruin the Bulgarian
Inhabitants, alike in the large cities and
in the small villages. Wholesale massa
cres, individual murders, the destruction
of villages, the pillaging and setting fire
to houses; the arrests, ill-treatment, tor
tures, arbitrary* imprisonment and ban
ishment; the closing and disorganizing ot
churches and schools, the ruining of mer
chants, the collection of taxes for many
years in advance â such proceedings, the
memorandum says, are the acts of the
Ottoman administration of Monastlr, Us
kub and Adrianople.
PRISONS ARE CROWDED.
The memorandum next relates in de
tail a number of such cases in each vil
ayet. Beginning with the vilayet of Sa
lonica, it states that in the town of Sa
lonica itself the Bulgarian professors of
the university, the students and shop
keepersâIn fact, all the intelligent Bulga
rians in the cityâ have been cast Into
prison.
One hundred and twenty soldiers entered
the village of Gorna-Ribnltea on May 19
and tortured to death five men and two
women
During the first three weeks of July
twenty-five villages In the district of Tik
vesch were subjected to the depredations
of the Turkish soldiers and Bashi Ba
zouks. The villagers were beaten and
tortured, the women violated and the
houses plundered, while the administra
tive authorities took no action.
In the vilayet of Monastir, artillery bom
barded and razed the flourishing town of
Smerdesch, 300 houses being left a heap of
ruins.
At the beginning of July two Greek
bands with the connivance of the author
ities plundered Bulgarian hous-es.
In the vilayet of Uskub the entire Bul
garian population has been systemati
cally persecuted since lasl May. The di
rector of the normal school at Uskub
was imprisoned because his library con
tained the "revolutionary" works of
"Othello" and "Les Miserables."
In Palanja. Kollschini, Koumanovo and
Gostigar the prisons are filled w\th Bul
garian priests, schoolmasters a^jd mer
chants.
During June the soldiers and Bashi
Bazouks terrorized the inhabitants of the
Schllft district, torturing the people with
red hot Irons. Similar atrocities perpe
trated in the vilayet of Adrianople are
cited.
, Altogether, the memorandum gives par
ticulars of no less than 131 Individual and
general cases of excesses and outrages
committed by the Turkish authorities. In
summarizing the specific details of the
outrages mentioned the memorandum de
clares that wholesale massacres were
perpetrated by regulars and Bashi Baz
ouks in the town of Salonica nnd the vil
lages of Balevet, Banitza, Echourilove,
Karbinza, Moffhila and Smerdesch and
Enldje, while the scenes of carnage, pil
lage and incendiarism were everywhere
terrible.
MTJRDEBS IN SMERDESCH.
At Smerdesch, more than 200 Bulga
rians were shot, killed with swords or
burned to death. More than 250 houses
and the churches and schools were set
on fire with petroleum and pillaged, the
property being sold by the soldiers and
Bashi Bazouks In neighboring places
Similar scenes occurred at the villages of
Gorhnah-Rlbnltz, Igoumentz, Dobrilaki
and Nlkodon. The villaeers there aban
doned their homes and fled to the moun
tains. More than 3000 men, women and
children fled from the sanjak of Seres and
even more from the sanjak of Kirkk-
Iisse.
It Is difficult, says the memorandum, to
obtain the exact number of Bulgarians
â¢who were Imprisoned, mostly on the
flimsiest pretexts, as when they were re
leased others were Immediately arrested.
The estimates obtainable give for the vi
layet of Salonlca 900 prisoners; for Uskub
BOO; for Monastlr 850 and for Adrianople

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, August
15.â After a number of years epent
in work upon an Important new
book, Dr. Julius Goebel, head of the
department of Germanic languages at
Stanford University, has at last complet
ed the volume and it is now In the hands
of the publishers. The book, which was
prepared by Dr. Goebel at the request of
a noted publishing house in is
an exhaustive treatise on the conditions
and aspects of the Germans living In
America, and is one of a scries of similar
reports on the German colonies tn vari
ous parts of the world. The book is a
compilation of "facts gathered by Dr.
Goebel through many years of travel and
study; It will contain a great amount of
material heretofore unpublished, and in
effect will be a complete history of the
Germans in America, from the earliest
colonization until the present tfme, and
PERSONAL MENTION.
Other important books from Dr.
Goebel's pÂ«n have been published from
time to time during the past fifteen years
and he is now looked upon as one of the
foremost contributors in this clasa of in
ternational literature.
Dr. Goebel was a student at the Unl*
verslty of Liepzig and received the degree
of Ph. D. at the University of Tuebingen
in 1SS2. He was instructor of German at
Johns Hopkins for several years and at
or.e time was editor o? the "Belletris
tisches Journal" in New York City.
into the western wilderness. Further
more, the important part taken by tho
Germans in the wars 0? the Revolutloa
and the Rebellion is pointed out with his
torical citations which simply substanti
ate the author's words. Lastly the influ
ence of German science and literature is
set forth to emphasize the scope of this
feature of American culture. The new
work is dedicated to President Roosevelt.
The book is entitled "Das Deutschthum
in den Vereinlgten Staaten von Amerika,"
and is a comprehensive work. Perhaps
the most imDortant thought conveyed by
the author is expressed in a. chapter de
voted to the winning of the West by the
Germans. It is slfown that the German
pioneers from Pennsylvania, Virginia and
the Carolina* were the first to push out
the latter part of the work, especially. Is
a consensus of German influence in this
country at the beginning of the twentieth
century. Among other things, the book
contains statistics to prove that almost
one-half of the present population of the
United States Is of German descent,
either entirely or otherwise. The influ
ence of this element in our civilization is
shown in the opening and extension of
the resources of the country; in the de
velopment of our higher intellectual life
as expressed in music, literature and ed
ucation.
WHAT is entitled in its corporate charter as
"The Cash Buyers' Union First National Co
operative Society" has just been incorpor
ated under the laws of New Jersey. Our Eastern
exchanges say it is believed to be a department store
trust. Certainly the name is long enough and big.
enough to mean almost anything and to do almost
any kind of business, for if ever the cash buyers^
achieve a genuine national union they will wish to
include within the scope of their activity all thing's
that are offered for cash from a scat in the Senate to
a pint of peanuts.
The objects of the corporation as specified in its
charter are as wide and as varied as the title is long.
They arc thus set forth in the New York Times:
"To establish, conduct, and manage general depart
ment stores in every State in the United States and
Europe. To manufacture, buy and sell all kinds of
merchandise, animate or inanimate. To manufacture
all kinds of raw materials into finished products. To
own, acquire and conduct printing, lithographing, en
graving and publishing business. To construct, own,
operate or lease warehouses in every State of the
United States and in foreign countries. To organ
ize and operate schools of instruction and libraries.
To carry on any of the business of house decorators,
sanitary engineers, electrical 'engineers and contract
ing in all the branches thereof; gas fitters; coal and
wood dealers; land, estate and housfe agents; builders,
contractors, storekeepers, "refreshment contractors
restaurant keepers/dealers in drugs and medicines and
mineral waters, barbers and hair dressers, perfumers,
dairymen, market gardeners, nurserymen and florists,
photographers and dealers in photographic supplies;
printers, lithographers and engravers; dealers in do
mestic trained and fancy antnfils and in every com-,,
modity sold in general department stores."
With a charter like that there will be well nigh no
legal limit to the activities of the corporation. It :
seems that perimÂ«sion is granted to do everything
except practice law, issue marriage licenses and write
poetry. \ It appears' the start of the all comprehending
octopus is to be made in a comparatively modest
way, for it has an authorized capital of only $5,000,000.
As that sum would not run the department stores of
New York City alone it will be some time before
the outreach of the corporation will attain to this
city. '"'.".'
A curious feature of the charter is that it gives tta
directors of the corporation the right "to enter into
and perform any kind of contract with the company."
It will be seen that the directors are to have riot only
a big hand and agrasping one, but also a free arm
to swing it with. Altogether the Cash Buyers' Union
First â¢', National Co-operative Society has not only
given itself a large name, but intends to acquire a
1 larger reputation as speedily as it can.
THE LATEST OCTOPUS.
PARLIAMENT has 'been prorogued by a speech
from the throne which the dispatches describe
as of little interest to the world or even to
the British public. It was a non-committal address,
which pledges the Ministry to nothing, so the dis
patches say: "There has probably never been a pro
rogation of Parliament leaving the future of the
Government so uncertain as is the case in* this in
stance." By the King's speech the prorogation runs
to November 2, but in the debate upon it some of the
leaders of the opposition declared a conviction that
the present Parliament would never meet again and
ihat there would be a dissolution and a general elec
tion in the fall.
The uncertainty of the situation is due almost
wholly to the keen interest taken in Chamberlain's
proposal for the establishment of a system of cus
toms duties on imports which will enable Great Brit
ain to protect her home industries, give preferential
trade to her colonies and obtain commercial privi
leges in other countries by reciprocity treaties. Since
Chamberlain first submitted his plan it has been the
chief theme of political discussion in the press and
among the people. The education bill and the Irish
land bill, of which so much, was heard when Parlia
ment met, have been almost completely set aside by
the new issue. It is true there remains a faction that
holds the educational Dill to be the most important
measure before the country, but it is onlya faction,
and it is safe to say that if a dissolution take place
this fall the ensuing election will be fought out 'mainly
between the free traders and the protectionists.
The Prime Minister is to make a speech at Shef
field at the end of September and the nation is waiting
eagerly for the event. He has hitherto avoided a
definite statement as to his attitude toward the tariff
as one of practical politics, and as a conseauence he
has in his Cabinet, along with Mr. Chamberiain, sev
eral men who are in strong opposition to him. The
Sheffield speech is expected to clear up the situation
and it is predicted that when it has been made either
Mr, Chamberlain or the Duke of Devonshire and his
free trade colleagues will have to leave the Cabinet/
That would entail a reorganization of the Ministry
and tray compel a dissolution of Parliament.
While Balfour has not decisively expressed himself
upon the issue at point he has said many things
which give ground for the belief that he will favor
the Chamberlain scheme. Thus in discussing it in
Parliament he said on one occasion: "Many persons
have allowed themselves to be led into a belief that
this controversy is" simply a controversy as to whether
the food of the people should be taxed. That is not
the controversy. There is no logical or substantial
reason I know of why a policy, if it be wise and if it
be practicable in other ways, should not ; be carried
out without increasing the cost of living to the
poorer classes of the country." On -another occa
sion he showed that he is much influenced by Cham
jberlain's argument far a preferential tariff as a means
PARLIAMENT PROROGUED.
Professor Moses Assures us that the theory and
practice of our teaching in the schools of the Philip
pines are .eminently successful. Recent events indi
cate clearly therefore that this conclusion of an emi
nent educator proves that our instructors in the
islands of the Southern seas have not enrolled many
of the ladroncs in the public schools. . These rascals
appear to be imperious to sweetness and light.
IT is seldom that general business conditions arc
so thoroughly understood by the public as at
present. One reason is their simplicity, the other
ii that this is pre-eminently a commercial era and
commerce attracts more scrutiny and study than it
ever did before. History will probably designate this
as the commercial age.
\s for the first reason the situation is simply that
the merchandise trade of the country is proceeding on
quiet and well-ordered lines, while the great specula
tive mart of the country has been writhing in the
throes of an old-fashioned attack of colic. Legiti
mate trade, composed and well balanced, has been
contemplating this speculative convulsion with the
indifferent eye of a mastiff mother lazily observing
the antics of her puppy working itself up into a frenzy
over a newspaper or an old hat. Stocks have gone
down, down, down; recovered and gone down again,
and so on, while the farm and counting-room have
been as quitt as millponds. But, of course, this
cannot last forever; sooner or later, some time or
other, general business will be affected by these
stock-market spasms unless the country's legislators
provide an elastic currency adapted to the rapid ex
pansions and contractions of business characteristic
of modern times.
It is a case of tempora mutantur. Times change
and we change with them. Forms and methods of
business become modified through various causes and
the currency must conform to the demands of the
new conditions or there is trouble.
As far as individual staples are concerned there
have been but few changes during the 1 past week.
The clearings of the banks are just about what they
were a year ago, the difference being less than I per
cent. The failures were 175, against 148 last year.
The earnings of the railroads thus far in August show
a gain of about 8 per cent in favor of this year and
the railroads are becoming unable to handle all the
freight tendered them owing to insufficiency of cars.
This indicates an enormous distribution of merchan
dise, for the railroads have been stocking up with
new cars for several years back, and though the facto
ries have been working to their full capacity all this
time they have not yet caught up with their orders.
This condition says more for the state of business
than any other. The foreign trade, however, is not
making as good an exhibit as the domestic, as both
exports and imports have been decreasing of late.
The iron and steel trades are reported active without
any excitement and quotations show some slight
changes.
Fall business in the different descriptions of cloth
ing is expanding generally throughout the country,
which is a regular seasonal condition at this time of
the year. Hides and leather have been weakening
for some little time and provisions continue to drag
toward a lower plane of values, with the output of
hogs ?.nd other livestock steadily increasing. There
is nothing new of any consequence in the cotton and
woolen trades. The crop outlook of the country con
tinues excellent, though previous estimates of the
volume of the wheat yield have been materially re
duced during the past ninety days.
Wall street has shown considerable \ tendency
toward reaction during the past week. The general
trend of prices was upward, and on one or two days
?he recovery was very pronounced. The opinion is
growing that the decline, like the preceding inflation,
lias gone too far, and that a good many shares are
now selling below their actual worth as dividend
propositions. The public, however, has not yet re
covered from its recent nervousness and is not flock
ing freely to the bargain counter. The bankers are
reassuring them, but they arc like shy animals, slow
to approach.
Our local conditions remain about as before. With
excellent crop conditions, good prices for farm
products, a steady overland and foreign demand for
our State products, plenty of money, high wages,
labor fully employed, a steady immigration into the
State and active domestic markets, the condition of
affairs in California is not only cheerful but bright and
full of promise. Prosperity is still with us.

navy that has not been more or
less seriously injured by running Into
some hidden rock or other obstruction.
The accident of the Massachusetts on
August 12 Is the third to that battleship
since her first commissionâ June 10, 1S93.
On December VI, 1898, the ship scraped' her
bottom on Diamond reef In New York
harbor, necessitating repairs at a cost of
$138,000. On March 21. 1901, she ran aground
in Pensacola Harbor, sustaining slight In-
Jury and now the ship has located another
rock by bumping against it and getting
seriously damaged. Captain H. N. Man.
ney, her commanding officer, is evidently
not afraid of his ship, but takes great
chances. He took the same ship through
Hell Gate June 20. 1901, narrowly escaping
grounding and the Navy Department re
buked him for his rashness. On June 20
last the Massachusetts collided with a
schooner off Boston Light, and thus the
ship is acquiring a record of bad luck,
largely due to poor or reckless naviga
tion.
The office of naval Intelligence estab
lished inJ882 has up to the present time
Issued many publications relating to
naval matters at home and abroad. Un
der the* title of "Information From
Abroad," a yearly volume has been issued
since 1883, giving a synopsis of naval con
struction in, all countries, which because
of the evident care bestowed In making
the Information as reliable rs possible,
and because of the limited edition Is much
Bought for. This set of twenty-one vol
umes contains the . record , of . progress
made In the world's navies from 18S4 and
is the only work of its kind in existence.
It has been somewhat' Inconsistent in its
scope of information owing to the fre
quent changes of secretaries of the navy,
chief of the office and personnel of the
staff. Up to 1S93 it dealt with all navies,
but In the year named Secretary Tracy
eliminated all the data relating to the
United States navy: in 1895. under Secre
tary Herbert, the edition was cut down
to 1000 copies, and now. for seme unex
plained reason, its publication 1ms been
discontinued.
President Roosevelt has written a letter
to the recently organized Navy L-a^ue

bly in England and Germanyâ Is lacking

The reported! explosion of a water-tube
boiler, August 8, on board the British

the British navy. She was, fitted with six
ordinary boilers of the Scotch type and
there Is no record showing that new style

The new system of teaching languages
by means of gramaphones has been in
troduced at the Naval Academy. One hun
dred and flfty-flve of these machines,
each containing ten records, have been
placed In the rooms of the midshipmen
to Instruct them in the French and Span
ish languages. The lessons of the day as
printed in standard books used at the
academy are repeated by the records, so
that the midshipmen have their eye and
ear educated at the same time In the
language they are studying. A trial of
this new method is said to have given
very satisfactory results.
There is no delay on armor contracts
for the eighteen battleships and armored
cruisers under construction. All the or
ders have been placed and the shipbuild
ers alone may be blamed for non-delivery
of ships at the stipulated time. On August
6 six hundred tons of armor was tested
and accepted for the battleships New Jer
sey and Rhode Island, the snips being
only 40 per cent completed. The plates
tested were for the belt, 11 inches thick
at the top and 8 inches at the bottom, and
the penetration of our 8-inch capped pro
jectile fired at a velocity of 1608 feet per
second was only three -and one-half
inches.
Jn this country is quite evident. There is
an utter absence of publications, entirely
or largely devoted to naval subjects, and
the only information the public at large
receives is an occaasional item about the
launch of a ship or disaster to some
foreign or United States naval vessel- Tet
there is a respectable number of persons
interested in naval affairs. The r.avy per
sonnel, rank and file, numbers upward of
40,000, to which add the navy yard farces
and the thousands of persons cn;?aged in
building ships for the navy. In England.
France, Germany, Italy, and even Spain,
public interest is stimulated through semi
official or official publications relating to
naval matters with good results. The
United States Government should ex
tend rather than curtail its information
on what is going on in the several navies
and should not have discontinued the
"Information From Abroad.'.'
DR. JULIUS GOEBEL OF THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY
WRITES A HISTORY OF THE GERMANS IN AMERICA
no occasion to use steam except In her
donkey boiler.
The British Admiralty haa placed con
tracts for four scouts with Laird. Vlck
ers, Armstrong and Fairfleld. The new
ships are to be duplicated or those now
under construction by the builders named,
and vary In dimensions and horsepower,
but are all to have a speed of 25 knots.
The Pathfinder, building at Laird's, is
360 feet by 38 feet. 13 feet 3 inches draught.
2610 tons and 16,000 horsepower. The larg
est, named Sentinel, is 260 feet length.
33% feet beam. 11 feet 2 Inches draught.
2900 tons displacement and 17.000 horse
power. They have all a normal coal ca
pacity of 150 tons and carry a battery ot
ten 12-pounder quick-firing guns.
The Londow Times of July 24 states tiet
the Euryalus, an armored cruiser of 12,
000 tons, had proceeded to sea for the pur
pose of trying her 9.2-lnch guns on Ions
range with an increased charge of 25
pounds of cordite. The gun stood the test,
but the mountings and ail the machinery
in the vicinity were torn up. On the fol
lowing day the Admiralty denied the
above statement, asserting that no such
trial had taken place and that the Eurya-
Iu3 had not fired her guns since June
20. The Admiralty Is, of course, loth to
have any news of a disquieting nature
become public and its contradictions on
several occasions have proved to be mere
quibles, notably In recent accidents to
ships In thÂ« Mediterranean? In the
Euryalus case the Times has probably
again forestalled official Information.
All battleships and a largo number of
cruisers in the British navy are fitted with
wireless telegraphy, chiefly the Marconi
system. The present expense upon wire
less telegraphy is about 1100.000 a year,
and an agreement with the Marconi com
pany is pending by which the use of the
system would be greatly extended in. the
navy, as well as on coast stations.
The armored cruiser Donegal has at
tained the phenomenal average of 23.737
knots and 22.134 horsepower during the
eight-hour full power trial last month
and Is the fastest ship of her type in the
British and all other navies. The ves
sel's performance is so much more re
markable from the fact that the ship was
fully completed and ready for active ser
vice, a condition which the Admiralty
now exacts from the contractors. Her
maneuvering trials were also satisfactory.
The Donegal was built and engined at
the Fairfleld yard, near Glasgow, and Is
1 of 9S0O tons. Of the ten ships of this class
eight have been tried and accepted up to
the present time.
In fact public interest in the issue is now so great
that if the various industries injured by the fraudu
lent trades will, unite and present their demands
strongly before Congress it is well nigh certain an
effective bill on the subject wijl be enacted during
the coming term.
The Call has for several years been urging the
wine, oil and fruit men of California to look to Con
gress for a bill of the kind proposed by the wine
growers and has repeatedly pointed out the injury
resulting from the present license allowed to the
manufacturers of spurious goods. If nothing has
been done by Congress of a really effective nature to
prevent the sale of adulterated and falsely branded
articles it is only because the various industries af
fected have not yet combined to work for the common
good. The action taken by the wine men at St.
Helena promises good results because k represents
organization and union, but the prospect of success
would be brighter still if the fruit men and the oil
men of the State would form similar organizations tol
work for the same end.
It is not merely adulteration that should be forbid
den, but false labeling. A great deal of harm is done
to many industries by the practice of unscrupulous
manufacturers in labeling inferior goods as standard
brands. Comparatively worthless Eastern fruit is
sold in Eastern markets under the name. of Califor
nia fruits, and our oil men and our wine men suffer
similar wrongs. s
That the issue will be a difficult one to deal with is
conceded, but it is quite possible to frame a bill that
will injure no legitimate industry, while ridding the
country of the great mass of fraudulent food and
medicines now on the market. * The wrong affects
every consumer as well as the producers of honest
goods, and there is a strong public sentiment to sup
port the demands of the reformers. The conditions
of the time are therefore propitious to the movement
of the wine producers, and if they stay with the fight
they may attain the desired Federal law during the
coming winter.
CALIFORNIA^wine men have taken an oppor
tune time to organize for the purpose of peti
tioning Congress to prohibit the sale of adul
terated wines in the American market. The issue
has long been under consideration and in the general
form of a fight for pure food is now engaging the
attention, of leading. men in nearly every legitimate
producing industry in the United States. Dairymen,
flour manufacturers, fruit men, oil men, meat packers
and the manufacturers of pure drugs have all within
a comparatively short time declared themselves in
favor of- the; enactment of a Federal law which will
protect the honest producer from the unfair compe
tition of men whose goods are either adulterated or
are falsely labeled.
IURE WINE LAWS.
< It is seldom that Californians have so general a
community of interest in the movements of a band
of men now at large in our midst. The savage crea
tures who* escaped from Folsom prison and disap
peared no one knows where and apparently no one
knows how have become in our imaginations ubiqui
tous. We may meet them anywhere and at any time,
and under any condition they will be dangerous.
Reverence too will be given abundantly to the army
nurses, those brave women who left their homes to
minister to the sick of the camps and the wounded of
the battlefields. Their trials were not lighter than
those of the soldier at the front, their patriotism not
less. They too served their country well and the
story of their deeds will remain for all time as an in
spiration to the patriotic womanhood of the republic.
So for every grade and rank of the visitors and for
the families who have come with them to share in
the patriotic inspirations of the encampment and to
see the wonderland of California there will be a cor
dial welcome everywhere. San Francisco is not to
stand alone in the welcome, for from all parts of our
great State invitations will come to the veterans to
visit localities already notable for beauty and for
hospitality. Moreover thousands of Californians will
come to this city to take part in the events of the re
ception here; so that it is a literal Calif or nian wel
come that is extended to the veterans, and we may
be sure they will carry with them a thousand pleasant
memories of it when they return to their Eastern
DURING this week therchief business and the
chief pleasure of San Francisco will be that
of entertaining the veterans of the Grand
Army of the Republic. To that end the promptings
of loyal hearts and the ministrations of willing hands
will be given unceasingly until the encampment closes
and the veterans depart.
It is right and fitting that it should be so. In the
order of nature it is not likely we shall ever see again
a gathering of the Grand Army in this city. Many
cities will compete for the honor of entertaining the
veterans in future years, and their ranks are now so
rapidly diminishing that long ere it comes our turn
to again receive'them their numbers will be few and
it is doubtful if among the survivors there will be
many who can come across the continent from their
Eastern homes to assemble on this coast. Our wel
come this week therefore must be one of "hail and
farewell," and though it may not be openly spoken
the feeling will be in the hearts of all that we are now
as a city giving d\ir final greeting to the Grand Army
as an organization.
Among our visitors are many whose names are
familiar in. our mouths as household words. They
are the commanding ones on whose, lives and deeds
the light of fame has fallen. The youth of the city
will hold it hereafter as a precious memory that they
have seen and perhapslhave heard these famous ones
with whom history ana tradition will be busy. It
will delight them to recall that they have a personal
recollection of this or that man whose name they will
meet in reading the annals of their country. So to
the famous ones all eyes will be turned during the
week and San Francisco will feel a pride in doing
them honor.
It is not to the famous only, however, that the
hearts of the people will turn with affection. The
essential spirit of Americanism is that of a genuine
democracy that recognizes /worth wherever found,
and we know that in the ranks are many veterans as
worthy of honor as those whose high offices render
them more conspicuous. Americans have never
failed to give proper tribute to the privates in the
ranks, the men who bore the heat and the burden of
the day, whose pay was small, to whom promotion
never came, whose names are unrecorded save in the
annals of their homes, and who during all the years of
the war fought with an undimmed patriotism and an
unflagging courage from a sense of duty and of loy
alty to their country and to' the sacred cause repre
sented by its banner.

of conserving the empire, for he said: "There is a
side to this controversy which is. beyond mere politi
cal economy and the wisdom to be derived from sci
entific text books. That question is the question of
closer imperial unity. * * * It is an idea very
alien to the palmy days of free trade. Mr. Cobden
had, I believe, little regard for the colonies. Mr."
Bright said it did not matter to us to whom India
belonged. We have all passed beyond that. We
have passed beyond it as political economists; we
have passed beyond it as patriots."
From utterances of that kind the protectionists
draw the conclusion that when events force the
Prime Minister to declare himself he will be found
on the side of Mr. Chamberlain. Then the issue will
have to be met by ParliamenUand by the people.
Such being the case there appears good reason fpr
deeming that the present Parliament will have but a
short career even should it ever meet again.

Tug H. H. Buhne in Port.
The atmosphere oft the port yesterday was
clearer than It has been for some months and
the marine observers at Point Lobos were able
to make a wide survey of the approaches to
the Golden Gate. The day opened with a thick
fog acroes the harbor entrance, but as the
sun gained ptrength the mists vanished and
by noon the Farallones an'd Point Reyes were
plainly visible. Point Reyes Is about thirty
miles from Point Lobos and the Farallones
some twenty-four miles distant, but when the
Bun set last evening both points were still
plainly visible. : ; -x^

SCHOONER OTELIA PEDERSON, WHICH WAS ABANDONED BT HER
CAPTAIN AND FELL INTO THE HANDS OF SAVAGES, WHO
BURNED HER FOR THE IRON IN HER HULL.
The derelict Pederson was next sighted
off the coast of Formosa. A Japanese
gunboat was sent after her. The schooner
had beached herself on a desolate part
of the southeast coast of the island. The
commander of the gunboat had the cargo
taken ashore, where it still awaits a
claimant. When the gunboat went away
the savages who inhabit . the island
boarded the wreck and finding much
precious iron and steel lmbeddad in her
frames, set fire to the hull. The wood
was consumed and the metal is now in
commission in the form of weapons of
warfare.
The schooner J. H. Lunsmann, a vessel
much like the Otelia Pederson, built at
the same yard and managed by the same
people, also lost her rudder on the voy
age from the Sound to Hongkong, but in
her case a jury rudder was ilgged and
she reached her destination pafely.
more than 1,000,000 feet of lumber
on board, has been burned by the savage
inhabitants of the Island of Formosa,
who resorted to this method to obtain
from tr.: hull the rich harvest of iron
and sleel wnich entered into its construc
tion. Newb 01" the schooner's fate has just
reached tlii& city in a communication to

the vessel's cargo is piled up on the For
mosa beach, and unless the insurance pen.
pie make vÂ» unapt arrangements for so â¢
curing it tut Japanese Government will
; .ukt poha-j.-s.cm. â¢ As the location of this
balvage is very remote, it is more than
likely- that no effort will be made by the
underwriters to recover It. The loss has
been paid and will be pocketed with as
much philosophy as possible, and all that
will remain of the Otelia Pederson, as far
as the occidental* world Is concerned, wiil
be the memory of her desertion y Cap
tain John C. Hansen.
The Otelia Pederson, bound from the
Sound for Hong-kong with more than l,0OJ,
000 feet of lumber, had her rudder car
ried away in a typhoon. The Pederson
was only about a year old. Her cargo
was made up of massive lengths of pine
intended for ,the construction of a new
drydock at Hongkong. The disabled ves
sel was spoken by the United States gun
boat Princeton, the commander, of which
offered Captain Uansen all the assistance
he might require for the rigging of a Jury
rudder.
The carpenter of the Princeton prepared
plans for a temporary steering apparatus
and from the crew of the gunboat were
selected a number of skilled mechanics to
carry out the design and put the big
schooner in condition to be navigated to
port, but a few hundred miles away. The
Otelia Pederson was in no danger what
ever. She was new and tight and loaded
with lumber as she was, could hardly
sink. She was well manned numerically
and whatever was lacking of mechanical
skill in the Pederson's personnel was
more than made up in the assistance of
fered by the captain of the gunboat. On
the bark Homeward Bound, which ar
rived here recently, a jury rudder was
rigged during a gale off Cape Horn, and
time and again vessels have entered the
Golden Gate steered .with, emergency ap
pliances rigged under difficulties compared
.with which the plight of the Otelia Peder
son was but a slight, inconvenience.
Between the quality of Captain Hansen
of the Otelia Pederson and that of the
average master mariner, however, there
is a wide gulf. Hansen . declined the
Princeton's offer, but accepted the navy
captain's hospitality and leaving his ves
sel to her fate, went, with his crew on
board the gunboat and was carried to
Hongkong. The abandonment of the
Otelia Pederson is probably without par
allel in the history of the sea. When
Captain Hansen returned here he blamed
the Princeton's captain and declared that
his crew had deserted him. At the inves
tigation held in this city, however. Cap
tain Hansen's story was. punctured In
every detail. The testimony ot his offi
cers and men, the written report made
by, the commander of the Princeton and
finally, Hansen's own admission*, all told
the story of his lack of courage and hasty
abandonment of the property intrusted to
hi a care.
THE handsome new four-masted
schooner Otelia Pederson, which
was abandoned last October in
Asiatic waters with a cargo of
SAVAGES BURN ABANDONED SCHOONER

quit as a plain business proposition. The
idea seems to be to send us on a wild
goose chase around the country looking
for a team to play with. We do not like
the idea."

SARATOGA. Aug. 16.â Good as Satur
day's racing was â aad It was probably
the best day's sport ever seen at Sara
togaâthere Is no apparent reason why.
Â¦with a continuance cf the favorable con
ditions which exist at present, the racing
of the coming Saturday should not be
its equal Izi point cf excellence. The sport
for the week promises unusually well,
and if to-morrow's card can be taken as
a criterion there will be a decided Im
provement in the size of the fields.
The entries for the six races to-morrow
total nlnety-slx, the smallest field being
thirteen in the steeplechase. The track
Is now fast and owners who have been
compelled to keep their horses in the sta
ble owing to the bad going welcome the
opportunity to send them to the post.
The stakes throughout the week are
attractive and the week will wind u]i
with an especially brilliant list. The
Shillalah Steeplechase, the Grand Union
Hotel Stakes for 2-year-olds and the Sara
toga Cup for 3-year-olds and upward at
a mile and six furlongs, are scheduled.
The entries for the Saratoga cup are

The Cripples started in early to wallop
the slow offerings of Ham Iberg. How
well they succeeded is shown by the score.
In all, seven runs and twelve base hits
were piled up, almost enough to win any
ball game. "Ham" received support that
bordered on the real shad line. Shay alone
helped out considerably by his miscues,
making three in all. The rest of the in
fielders each committed one. Lynch let
an easy hit to left field go through him.
The Cripples fielded In grand form not
withstanding their three errors. During
the fifth inning they shut the home team
out, though the latter made three hits
and Dut a man on every bag. Shay
started the business with a hit and Meany
did likewise. Irwin followed the lead with
a bunt to third, which he beat out.
Leahy hit a foul against the stand, but
Gorton ran after it and although he hit
his head an awful bump against the wire
netting he got away with the ball and
started the crowd yelling. Pabst then hit
a liner at Francks. He promptly corraied
it and doubled up Meany at second base,
ending the round.
Graham was there all the time and
after, the first inning had his opponents
well under the spell of his south wing. He
walked few and had an assortment of
curves which seemed to puzzle the Na
tives all the time. The score:

VICTORY and defeat came to
both the Cripples and the Natives
in yesterday's contest on the dia
mond. A ten-Inning affair in the
morning at Oakland was won by
Uncle's followers. The multitude pulled
for the Cripples at Recreation Park and
they were steadily rolling up runs until
they ultimately cantered away with the
spoils. 7 to 2.
The oast week's series has been any
thing but beneficial to the percentage
column of the home team. Out of six
games San Francisco landed but two â
Wednesday's and Sunday morning's.
Jimmy Whalen steered them to victory
on both occasions. The Natives will have
to enjoy a whole lot of prosperity and
luck during the next two series In order
to get back some of 'the games they lost
during tho week.
In only one inningâ the firstâ did Uncle's
tossers* show any form yesterday after
noon. They opened the game with a dash
and for the time being the hearts of the
Oakland backers were about out. Shay
hit. Meany was safe on Franck's error,
Irwin sacrificed and Leahy was hit by the
pitcher, filling the bags. Pabst hit to cen
ter and Shay arrived. Krug filed to left
and Meany came inr the last man of the
home team to register.

"I want to see the fight patrons have
everything that is coming to tiiem. The
people elected me and I propose they shall
have their rights. Any complaint that
comes up before us regarding these al
leged methods of the Yosemite Club will
be sifted to the bottom. If the clubs don't
want to run the fights under the pre
scribed rules they will certainly be. denied
any further license. Mr. Boxton is chair
man of the committee, and I know he
will not for an instant countenance any
such dealings in tickets as Is alleged to
have taken place at the last fixht."
Supervisor Frederick Eggers was equal
ly positive in the position he took in the
case in nuestion. He said:
"The club officials must do what is right
or quit. The fight so far as the principals
were concerned was certainly fair and
straight. That part gave entire satisfac
tion. The Supervisors will permit no ac
tions that are not entirely within the
straight ruling of the law. The club offi
cials will find this out when they come up
for further permits. We wani the busi
ness dene straight and if It is trot done
that wav no further permissions for
fights will be granted."
The "gouging process" practiced upon
the public by the agents of the Yosemite
Athletic Club continues the topic of
much unfavorable comment. When the
Yosemite Club officials go to the Super
visors for a permit for another light they
may tind they overreached themselves by
their methods of last Fridays combat,
and that the r>ermit may not be forth
coming. Sunirvisor Charles Boxton.
chairman of the Supervisors' Police Com
mittet, was forcible in his remarks when
speaking of the club's actions. He said:
Coffroth's position In the City Hall
gives him a knowledge in advance as to
the decisions In all cases in the various
departments of the Superior Court of
which he is an official.
As a member of the promoting club
Coffroth shared in the distribution of
$18,702, the club's share of the proceeds.
The manipulation of the tickets meant
big returns to the men who were in a po
sition to control the traffic.
It is a matter of history that the
fighters' share of the receipts was $43,638.
Under his contract with Coffrpth, Jim
Corbett was not paid on this basis. In
stead of receiving twenty-five per cent of
this amount he received twenty-five per
cent of $25,0u0. Thus by "underwriting"
Corbett's share Coffroth made $4,659.50.
He approached Jeffries with the same
proposition as the one made to Corbett,
but the champion would not consider the
matter. '
Besides arranging all the details of the

He found Jim Corbett had a doubt as to
the drawing powers of the contest. He
went to Corbett with the proposition that
he would sign a contract to settle with
him on the basis that the fighters' share
would be 525.0W. If Corbett won he
would receive "5 per cent of $25,000 and if
he lost he wauld receive 25 per cent of that
amount. Coffroth handled the corres
pondence of the ilub and thus had a*de
cided advantage over Corbett, as he knew
the interest the contest had created.

The* work of Lewis in the third class
was a surprise. He has been Improving
steadily, but made a much better show-
Ing: than was expected '
In the third class Stewart Gayness-won
for the third, time. The class cup now be
longs to him. In the final he beat Fred
Adams three straight sets, 6-2, 6-2. 6-4.
His hardest match in the tournament
was in the semi-finals, in which he had a
narrow escape from defeat. After losing
the first set, 7-5, to J. R. Lewis, he man
aged to get the next two by a narrow
margin, both of them going to deuce. The
score was 5-7. 8-6, 6-4. In the other semi
final match Adams beat L. D. Roberts '6-0,
6-1.
It was an Ideal day for tennis, and
benches for spectators were at a premium.
At least three out of every five spectators
were forced to witness the matches stand
ing.
As wns expected, the final match of the
first class proved the most interesting of
the tournament. It was a long drawn
ou: afialr, going the full five sets. AXÂ«*T
winning the first two sets handily, George
Baker, the ex-University of California
player, lost the next two. He won the
fifth and deciding one quite handily.
Charles Dunlap, his opponent, was out
classed in the first two sets. At their
completion he appeared to be hopelessly
beaten. He took the third one by a nar
row margin. Jn the fourth his play im
proved as much as Baker's fell off.
Dunlap tried hard In the last set. but
Baker put more force into his strokes and
won by his clever drives and accurate
lobbing. The score was 6-2, 6-2, 6-8. 2-<>,
6-2. This is the first time the cup has
been won and must be won three times.
In the second class H. Russell, an ex
champion of Michigan, after an absence
of five years from the courts, had a com
paratively easy time carrying off the
honors. In the final he beat Clarence
Foley, after losing the first set, 9-7. The
score w*as 7-9, 6-2, 6-4, 6-4.
What was expected to prove the most
interesting match of the class was some
what of a failure. George Janes, who was
considered , Russell's most dangerous op
ponent, injured his ankle in a practice
game before the match and Russell dis
posed of him easily. In the other half of
the semi-finals Foley beat Norman Am
brose 6-4, 6-2.
The class singles tennis tournament,
commenced on the Golden Gate Park
courts two weeks aeo, was finished yes
terday. The honors were won by George

ALAMEDA. Aug. 16.â Railroad fran
chises, applications and ordinances will
occupy the attention of the City Trustees
at their regular meeting to-morrow night.
It is expected that the City Attorney will
submit two ordinances containing the stip
ulations upon which the Citizens' Commit
tee of Fifty recommended that the South
ern Pacific be offered the two local fran
chises it seeks. One of these, howeverâ
that for the north side of Railroad avenue
âmay not be necessary, for the Southern
Pacific management has intimated that
it will file a withdrawal of the application
for a franchise on that road. The com
pany has always operated the Railroad
avenue branch without a franchise and
has concluded that it is as easy to con
tinue to do so as to worry over additional
trouble before the application now on file
is acted upon.
Howard K. James, who refuses to say
who he represents, has been circulating a
petition to have the matter of the fran
chises referred to the people to vote upon.
Some of the City Trustees hold that under
the provisions of the referendum ordi
nance that measure cannot be invoked at
the present time.
Hermann Epplnger Jr. and Robert B.
Mott, who applied for the two local fran
chises, saying that they would pay the
city a bonus of $10.000. for the same after
they had been given the privileges free
of any.incumbrance, have not made any
move lately since the Citizens' Committee
of Fifty investigated the financial stand
ing of Eppinger. It is said that Eppinger
and Mott have had a falling out with the
principals of the American Surface Elec
tric Railway and Supply Company, wElch
corporation owns the patent and rights
of a" third-rail electric system, said to be
a mechanical and safe success. Eppinger
and Mott implied in their statements to
the City Trustees that if they secured the
franchises they would install the third

pany. '. . < .

BERKELEY, Aug. 16.â Trinity Sun
day-school Chapel, born and
reared within a week, was dedi
cated to the cause of religion to
day with appropriate exercises,
in the presence of such an audience as
threatened to burst out the sides of the
little building. The dedicatory sermon
was preached by the Right Rev. John W.
Hamilton, resident Bishop for the Metho
dist churches of California. With his us
ual eloquence Bishop Hamilton stirred his
auditors to enthusiasm and before the day
was over $1585 had been subscribed toward
paying off the indebtedness on the chapel,
besides that for an organ, chairs and li
brary.
The chapel was unheard of, unthought
of, a week ago. Then Ernest F. Barry
presented a petition to the Rev. C. K.
Jenness, pastor of Trinity Methodist
Church, In which the residents In the
neighborhood of College avenue and Rus
sell street agreed to send their fifty chil
dren to Sunday-school if a chapel was
built. That was enough for Mr. Jenness,
and on Monday he purchased a .lot at Col
lege avenue and Russell street for $3000
and made arrangements to buy a ready
made chapel for $500.
It seems there is a firm in Oakland {hat
builds portable; houses. It cuts them qut
in much the same way that dresses are
cut out, according to pattern, and in a
little while a house grows up, fitted with
doors and windows and hinges and all. If
the owners get tired of the site at ariy
time they can fold It up and cart it away
to some other place.
Such a structure was used in this case,
and now Trinity Chapel stands where a
few days ago there was nothing. It is a
little redwood building, 16 feet wide and
40 feet Ions and seats 100 people. It stands
on a lot 120x120 feet, a portion of which
the church people propose to sell.
At the morning sen-ice at the Trinity
Methodist Church J1591 was pledged by
the congregation to pay for the thirty
foot lot that the church has Just pur
chased on Fulton street, adjoining the
parsonage. With this addition the church
now has a lot 130x130 feet, upon which it
proposes to soon build. a $50,000 church.

All of the information thus collected has
been carefully compiled and prepared for
public consideration. And it is the result
of all of this effort that is embodied in the
message and other documents now ready
for submission to the City Council.
Through all of the preliminary work since
the citizens" committee report was pub
lished the Mayor has closely guarded the
facts obtained, in order that no undue ad
vantage might be taken of the effort to
gain an Impartial knowledge of the ex
act conditions touching the best interests
of the city with relation to a municipal
water supply.
"That under existing conditions the city
of Oakland should own and distribute the
water supply to its citizens."
The committee also reviewed existing
conditions touching available sources of
supply and recommended the establish
ment of pumping stations In the Niles
cone or gravel beds contiguous to Ala
meda Creek, with pipe lines and all other
equipment necessary for supplying the
city from (that* source.
Since the report was presented two
members of the committee have become
members of the Official governing bodies
of the city. Mr. Olney was elected Mayor
and John L. Howard was choseri to be a
City Councilman. In their official capac
ity both have continued the work of in
quiry and Investigation. To gain further
light on the vast subject. Mayor Olney
and Councilman Howard recently em
ployed Expert Engineer . Fitzgerald to
make an independent examination of
available sources of water supply, in
cluding the Contra Costa Water Com
pany's properties, and to submit a report.
Other investigation along independent
lines has been in progress since January.
Mayor Warren Olney has completed his
message to the City Council, covering in
most exhaustive manner the subject of a
proposed municipal w'ater supply for the
city of Oakland. The document, together
with a voluminous report on the subject
from Desmond Fitzgerald, the eminent
hydraulic engineer of Boston, and other
data will be presented at the regular
meeting of the City Council to-morrow
evening.
These reports and documents cover a
record of long and laborious investigation
of the subject of a municipal water sup
ply. They are the result of the work of
the citizens' committee of five reor
ganized a year ago by popular appeal
after former Mayor Anson Barstow had
dissolved the committee he named. The
quintet, composed of R. H. Chamberlain,
Sol Kahn, John L. Howard and Warren
Olney, submitted its report in January.
The money, 14300, required to pay the ex
penses of the expert engineering work re
quired by tne committee in securing data,
was raised by popular subscription.
In its report the committee unanimous
ly recommended:

IS COMMING WEST
unexpectedly at his home, 1530
Railroad avenue, at 10:15 o'clock this
morning, after an illness of less than
eighteen hours. An autopsy showed the
cause of death to have been stricture of
the bowels.
Hay was one of the pioneer and best
known builders of wooden vessels on the
Pacific Coast*. Born in Nova Scotia sixty
eight years ago of rugged stock, he came
to California in 1S58 and for a time fol
lowed his trade as a shipwright in San
Francisco, later going to British Colum
bia, where for ten years he followed the
fortunes of a miner. He then returned to
San Francisco and established shipbuild
ing yards at the foot of Sixth street,
where many of the famous vessels of the
Pacific Coast, notably the Handy type of
steam schooners, were constructed. In
1890 Hay formed a partnership with the
late Ellsha B. Wright, who died here six
teen months ago. and moved the plant in
San Francisco to Alameda Point. There
the firm built a large fleet of vessels of
various classes, Including barks, barken
tlnes. steamers, schooners, dredgers and
smaller craft. The oil-carrying barken
tlne Fullerton. launched from the yards
at Alameda Point about fifteen months
ago. was the largest vessel constructed
under the supervision of Hay. ;,
Hay was a warm personal friend of the
late Irving M. Scott, the two having been
roommates and workmen together when
Hay first came to this State. Hay was a
past maeter in the art of constructing
ALAMEDA, Aug. 16. â Alexander
Hay, senior member and the last
survivor of the shipbuilding firm
of Hay & Wright, passed away
wooden ships, having learned the trade
when he was a lad in Nova Scotia. It is
said of him that he would not retain a
man in his employ who would put into
a vessel an unsound piece of timber, or
who evinced a tendency to be careless in
his work. For this reason all of the ves
sels turned out under the supervision of
Hay were generally considered to be as
good as first-class material and workman
ship could make them. Hay was a man
of large stature, retiring disposition and
kindly manner. He never took an active
interest in political affairs, although he
had been requested several times to al
low his name to be used as a candidate
for City Trustee. He was a member of a
Masonic lodge in Nova Scotia, but had
never affiliated with any fraternity here.
When Hay left his office at the Alameda
Point shipyards last evening he was feel
ing as well as usual, but before he
boarded a car near the Webster-street
bridge he was taken â¢ with violent palna.
which increased upon his arrival home.
A doctor was summoned, but all attempts
to aid the sufferer failed and- he died in
great agony. Hay was a widower, his
wife having died in 1S92. He Is survived
by a son, Warren B. Hay, and a daugh
ter. 12 years old. Florence Hay. Opera

. But at this juncture Mrs. Julia Z.
Hayes, a daughter of Mrs. Hughes, made
her appearance, and she has determined
to make a fight for her mother's prop
erty. Mrs. Hayes claims that her mother
deeded ,all of her property: to her, as her
only heir, many months ago; that the
deeds were made out 'and â¢ delivered
through J. S. Meyers, a real estate ngeul
of Oakland, and she has retained At
torney. J. J. McDonald to protect her.in
terests. .Mr. McDonald will to-morrow
bring suit to recover for Mre. Hayes all
of the property of Mrs. Hughes^Barnes.
There has also been some talk of try
ing to secure a guardian for Mrs. Hughes-
Barnes, but it is probable that tho daugh
ter will rely upon the civil suit to recover
the property.
The property in question is worth some
$25,000, and it is claimed by Mrs. Hayes
that her mother secured the J1000 neces
sary to bail Barnes out of jail by mort
gaging the real estate.
The Hughes-Barnes litigation has be
come one of the important cases that
have fallen into the criminal courts of
the county. William E. Barnes was a
drummer and he boarded with Mrs. Anna
Hughes, a widow, who lived on the cor
ner of Twelfth and Jefferson streets.
Barnes was of an ardent disposition, and
Mrs. Hughes reciprocated. But Barnes
cooled in his affections and it was charged
that he finally "lifted" a watch and some
property owned by Mrs. Hughes and pro
ceeded to "blow" the proceeds in 'a lively
time in San Francisco. Mrs. Hughes ha<t
him arrested for grand larceny, but when
she called upon him in the County Jail
she relented. On Friday last she put op
$1000 bail for him, and then proceeded to
marry the : man whom she had had ar
rested. The marriage will prevent \ur
from testifying against her husband, and
the authorities of the county saw nothing
to -do when the case came up for triai
but to dismiss -it.
William E. Barnes has secured his re
lease from jail by marrying Mrs. Anna
Hughes, but. he has riot secured posses
sion of Mrs. Hughes' property by that
act. Mrs. Hughes' daughter, Mrs. Julia
'/â¢. Hayes, has retained attorneys to pro
tect her interests, and there will be a
suit filed to-morrow to secure possession
of all of Mrs. Hughes-Barnes' property by
Mrs. Hayes on the ground that it was all
deeded to her before the marriage witn
Barnes.

New Novels of This
Money-Mad World
THE world is money mad That statement looks absolutely start-
ling in cold type, but when r you realize that it is a sentiment em-
anatinjr from the foremost political and financial economists of the
world it is time to beein to sit uP and take notice. If you doubt its
truth just take a casual glance at the popular literature of the hour.
You will invariably find that the theme is wealth, and more wealth, and
yet again more wealth â wealth in the spending even as much as wealth
in the making. Not the fairy tale lore of wealth of bygone aees. but
modern wealth that has to do wÂ«tlÂ» empire building, the destiny of na-
tions, the struggle for commercial dominance and aristocratic social su-
premacy of the men and women of the hour. vea. almost of the very
minute, so vast and so rapid is the rise and fall of the bureauocracv of
wealth. No more the tales of buried treasure of picturesque pirates or
lost min,es and enchanted palaces stored with riches, but the gold that
glitters before our very eyes â rich, yellow gold that we watch in the
making â gold that is accumulated while you wait by men we all know,
and spent with greater ease and facility by women who are better
known.
Of such a dozen books that everybody is reading right now might
be mentioned at random. To begin with there is "The Spenders."
which is concluded in the Sunday Call to-day, and which not only shows
the excitement of modern money making, but the more subtle art of
spending it. -Then there is "The Octopus." Frank Norris* famous tale ,
of the building of vast wealth, and* his later book. "The Pit." which tells
of the awful struggle to corner that same vast wealth. Then there are
"The Autocrat." "The Thirteenth District," "Tainted Gold." "The Mis-
sissippi Bubble," etc.. etc. Indeed the list might be swelled indefinitely.
But of all these novels none are quite like unto that verv latest
creation, "Brewster's Millions." In point of fact "Brewster's Millions"
is absolutely unlike anything that has ever been written before, for in it
a perfectly adorable young fellow has 1 to spend a million a vear. get his
money's worth and yet have absolutely nothing to show for it at the
i d of that time in order that he may inherit six million more. Sounds
fascinating, doesn't it? Well, it is more than that. j*JH
Now you may think it is the easiest thing in the world to soend a
million. Never tried it. of course^ But wait until you have read
"Brewster's Millions." which begins in the next Sunday Call, and you
will see what a stupendous task it is to spend a million a vear â actually
spend it â not dissipate it or give it away or lose it in false speculation,
but get your money's worth as you would if you had only a hundred in-
stead of a cool million.
But the popular craze of literature of the bright, snaoov. uo-to-date
sort goes even further than this. Never before was there such a tre-
mendous demand for short stories of. the best sort. And what better
reading could you get? A eood short story is a complete novel in con-
densed form, and it is iust such excellent Tending as this that is pro-
vided ifi the Sunday Call's new "Half Hour Storiettes." of which, next
Sunday, you will get two full pages. Here are some of the titles:
"Mysterious Leofric." "In the F1 a Â«h of Strined Death." "The Secret of
the Jamaica Sink Hole." "The Beautiful Miss Marrnm." "Fables for
the Foolish," "Shorty. Mahan's Passing." "Love's Golden Tether."
"While the Train> Waited." "Wh't Tmy Peter Did." etc.. etc. Best of
all there is a new short story by A. Cnnan Doyle. "The Shadow Be-
fore"; "Millions in His Dreams." by MarV Twain: "Me-ows of .-Â» Kitty."
by KattfThyson Marr: "The Oracle of Mulberry Center." by S. E. Kiser.
etc. etc.
And besides all this there is the regular Sunday Magazine section,
giving you the very latest in everything that is going on in the world
to-day. The Sunday Call can't be beat.THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 1903.

Yesterday was a Quiet day among the
yachtsmen of San Francisco Bay. Some
of the boats of the California and San
Francisco clubs cruised in the upper bay,
dropping anchor at Paradise Cove.
Among the Corinthian yachts which
were cruising were the yawls Seven Bells,
Frolic and Phyllis, and the sloops Genes
ta, Clara, Fleetwing and Merope. Many of
the neet lay at moorings all day. Frank
Stone's sloop Presto was under way, as
also was Robert Vincent's yawl Iola of
the California Yacht Club.
The Corinthian yachts which were on
the annual cruise up tne Sacramento
River last week had a hard time to make
their moorings yesterday, as the breeze
was light and a flood tide was running
strongly. The sloop Clara started on Sat
urday night from Tiburon and dropped
anchor off Marin Islands. The Corinthian
yachts due to return yesterday were the
t-loop Emma, which carried Commodore
E. F. Sager's flag during the up-river
cruise; the sloops Speedwell, Belle, Josle,
Meteor, Aeolus and Sea Fox. A good
breeze was blowing in the channel, but
elsewhere little wind was stirring.

Webber was a member of the firm of
Webber, Butts and Weske and was one of
the foremost practitioners In Sonoma
County. He had been out with a party
cf friends Saturday night and did not re
turn to his apartments until after 7
o'clock yesterday morning. That was trrb
last seen of him by his friends. He had
partially disrobed preparatory to retiring,
but the bed had not been used. When
discovered one of his arms and his head
were resting against a trunk and the
other arm stretched out under the bed.
There was a slight discoloration oT the
neck as if made by striking the trunk in
falling.
Webber was born in Jefferson County,
Wisconsin, In 1S69. He served for a time
as claims' clerk of the Santa Fe Rail
road at Topeka, Kansas, and came to
Santa Rosa about twelve years ago. For
several years he sold sewins machines
in this vicinity -while pursuing the study
of law. Shortly after he Â«was admitted to
the bar he was elected to the office of City
Attorney. He was re-elected to the posi
tion, but resigned the office to become
District Attorney, having been chosen to
the higher position. He was prominent in
State and county politics and occupied a
high place in the councils of his party.
About eight years ago Webber was
married to Miss Anna E. Ross, from
whom he was subsequently divorced.
Webber's death is believed to have been
due to heart failure. He was afflicted
with somnolence and frequently would
fall asleep while talking. He recently
waa reported lost in the wilds of Mendo
cino County where he was hunting with
a party of friends. For several days he
was not heard from, but was finally found
enjoying good health.
Coroner Frank L. Blackburn of Peta
luma was notified of the death and will

ing, died at bis residence, 4230 Twenty

o'clock and the body was removed to the

death Charles Sullivan and John H. Pow
ell, thÂ« two young men arrested at the
tin* by Policemen Nobmann and Clark,
and who have been in prison ever since,
were booked for murder.
SampJe in his ante-mortem statement ac
cused Sullivan of having fired the two
shots that hare since proved fatal. He had
been notified by Martin Kelly that two
young men were beating a man at Second
and Clementina streets, and on going
there found the aggressors were Sullivan
and Powell. He told them to go home
and they walked along Folsom street to
ward First and stepped into a doorway.
Sample followed tnem and In his state
ment he said that Powell Jumped out of
the doorwar and struck him. He drew
his club to defend himself, when Sullivan
threw him to the sidewalk. SulUvan took
Sample's revolver from him and fired two
shots at him whi'-p he lay on the side
walk and both bullets pierced his head,
one lodging at the base of the brain and
fracturing the skull.
Sullivan and Powell were arrested about
100 feet away from where Sample lay and
the revolver was found near them. Sulli

nothing was previously known against

The car came to a standstill when the
fuse blew out. .The motorman and the
conductor soon regained their presence
of mind and assured the passensers that
they were in no danger. Mr. and Mrs.
Kenny and the other two ladles recov
ered after a time and proceeded on their
way in another car. Miss Vinal was sent
to her home. Her injuries though painful
will not prove fatal.
The passengers were terrified for none
of them knew the nature of the" sudden
explosion. Mrs. Kenny fainted, and the
two ladies from Sacramento became hys
terical, and were too frightened to make
their way from the car. .Miss Vinal re
tained her presence of mind sufficiently
to rush out on the platform and as a re
sult she was seriously burned about the
head. Â¦ â¢
The peculiar accident happened so sud
denly that the few passengers in the car
and the motorman and conductor were
taken entirely unawares, and for a time
the carmen were so excited that they did
not know what had happened. It is for
tunate that the car was not crowded, for
if it had ' been a panic would have re
sulted.
In the car at the time were Frank
Kenny and his wife, Miss Alice
and two ladles from Sacramento re
fused to give their names. The passen
gers had no inkling of what was about
to happen, when suddenly^ as the car was
rounding the corner, a n^me shot out
Â¦from the rear and enveloped the entire
car.

late yesterday afternoon, a fuse suddenly
ttlew out. In a twinkling the car was
enveloped in flames. One woman fainted,
two became hysterical and a young girl
was badly burned about the head.
In other words, he placed the entire matter
in my hands for adjustment. This person who
brings the suit against me* was duly notified
of my appearance in the nxtter. and not being
able to *ecure my client's address 6he sent
various parties to my office in an effort to
secure the fame. My client having finally
sent me $250 to be paid on the claim, I
promptly remitted it to the creditor, together
with a letter informing her that If she per
sisted In giving me any further annoyance
about the matter Â«he would be compelled tw
wait much longer.
She paid no attention to my warning, and
as a remilt she hat been forced to wait for
final settlement. I am informed that she con
tends that my letter to her is in effect a.
promise on my part that she would receive her
money and therefore the suit is brought
against me. It goes without saying that there
is no liability on ray part either in law or
in fact.
Attorney George D. Collins has in prep
aratlon bis answer to the complaint filed
Saturday by Norine Collins, In which she
prays for Judgment against the attorney
for $350, which sum, it Is alleged, the
plaintiff advanced defendant during the
last four years.
la the answer, in which Attorney Col
lins will dispose of the report that the
pialctiff is his sister, by citing the fact
that he has no sister, he will make the al
legation that the money involved was ad
vanced by Miss Collins to a client who
'will return shortly from the gold fields
cf .Alaska,
Speaking of the action yesterday, Mr.
Coll'ns said:
In the first place the person alluded to is not
my sister nor any other relative of mine. I
have not more than a business acquaintance
with . her, arising from the fact that she
loaned to a client of mine certain sums of
money. It was not convenient for him to re
pay at the times she demanded repayment and
he consulted me about the matter, stating his
willingness to settle and desiring time to do
so.
The Pilgrim Sunday-school offers to children
and young people great opportunities to be
long to a faith where you do not have to un
learn anything, do not have to discuss creeds
or theologies only to live a life of Godliness â
a life that shall make good living, good help
ing and cood service for all mankind.
Now, if there is anything larger .than we
have to offer we want that larger thing. The
universal fatherhood of God, the universal
brotherhood of man, the leadership of Jesus is
the personification of righteousness â the ulti
mate triumph of right over wrong.
What is there lamer?
The men that made the history of this Sun
day-school make up a splendid list. There has
not, Indeed, been a single movement for the
uplifting of this city for fifty years that has
not had graduates of this Sunday-school >n the
forefront. And let me eay that you might go
to any one of forty or fifty cities of America
and find that the men, insignificant in num
ber in proportion to the population, the men
who are in the liberal churches, are the cap
tains of the movements that go to make for
the moral uplifting of that community.
Forty.'or fifty years ago Starr King and Ho
ratio Stebbins preached in San Francisco the
very things that are being proclaimed by
every progressive thinker in the pulpits of this
city to-day.
What we need is to guard our children
against the gross selfishness; and rank injus
tices of society.
TO GUARD THE CHILDREN.
The social and political troubles of the pres
ent day can nnd their solution only in such a
spirit.
We as a people have been trusting too much
to smartness and mental acumen.. But what
our young people and children need is a tight
spirit, a sensitive conscience and a deep rev
erence.
The fiftieth anniversary of the Pilgrim
Sunday-school was celebrated at the First
Unitarian Church yesterday morning.
Hundreds of children attired in pretty
light gowns, alike appropriate to the oc
casion and the beautiful day, swarmed
around the handsome edifice hours before
the ceremony began.
At 11 o'clock the church, which had been
handsomely decorated, was filled to over
flowing, and with an organ voluntary and
hymn and prayer the exercises began.
Charles A. Murdock, the Sunday-school
superintendent, presided and led the
juvenile congregation in the beautiful
hymn, "'Come Forth and Bring Your Gar
lands," which was quite appropriate in
view of the gift of a bouqufet and a plant
to each child. â¢
At the conclusion of the first part of the
exercises a historical} account of the Pil
grim Sunday-school was graphically told
oy Mr. Murdock, who gave reminiscences
of men who had labored for the advance
ment of children in the cause of right
eousness and the upbuilding of upright
lives in the community.
Besides Murdock some other speakers
were Horace Davis, Wendell Easton and
George and Aurelius Buckingham and Dr.
Van Orden, each giving an interesting ac
count of the Sunday-school and telling of
Its progress from the day of its humble
origin to its present sturdy 'growth and
power in the community.
ADVOCATES MORAL TRAINING.
Murdock showed that numerous of the
most prominent men of the city had been
members of that Sunday-school, and not
a few had gone to other parts of the land
buoyed and strengthened by the religious
and moral training assimilated at the Pli
grim Sunday-school. \
Following Mr. Murdock came the Rev.
Bradford Leavitt with a stirring address,
in which he appealed for morality, for
%:>nscience and for patriotic training in
the youth of San Francisco.
Mr. Leavitt said among other things:
There Is a growing conviction that what
America most needs to-day Js not more smart
men, but more good men. fatudents of sociol
ogy, leading educators, university presidents,
clergymen and writers are proclaiming that we
must have Improved methods of teaching re
ligion and morality. Having taken religious
teachings out of the public schools, we must
see to it that it is taken care of somewhere,
either in the home or in the church. Â¦
