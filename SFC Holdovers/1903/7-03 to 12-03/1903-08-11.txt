Special Dispatch to The CalL
- LONDON, Aug. 10.â The social revolt In
South Russia continues to spread and Is
everywhere taking the shape of strike
riots on a great scale. Dispatches just re
ceived from Nicolalcff tell of a severe
fight between 10,000 strikers and a mili
tary force from Odessa. The strikers
were ordered 'to disperse, with the alter
native of having ball cartridges fired at
them. They . refused and thereupon vol
leys were fired straight into the mob.
Twenty- persons were killed and 300 seri
ously wounded. ';''W ~y\-
The Cossacks were then ordered to
charge the strikers. âThey rode up and
down through them, wounding many.
This occurred on. August 5, but the
strike was still maintained and the town
is .in a state of anarchy. The central ad
ministrations of Industrial towns through
out a great area are completely at a loss
to know how to deal with the present
labor rising. â¢
The general strike at. Odessa marks a
"new era In the economic history of the
nation. . The tramway 'employes there
have resumed work' on the appointment
.of a, commission by the Governor to de
cide, their grievances. The steamship
companies. It is believed, will take a sim

ed and a fourth was full of victims.
PARIS, Aug. 11.â An awful catastrophe
occurred last evening on the Metropoli
tan Electric Railroad, which runs mostly
underground, in which many persons lost
their lives. Up to 3 o'clock this morning
eleven bodies had been recovered, and the
search continues. Â¦ -
One of the trains broke down at Monil
montant, which is in a po6r and popu
lcus section of the city. This train was
promptly emptied and the train which
followed was ordered to push It to the
repairing sheds. On the way these two
trains caught fire, but the employes suc
ceeded in cscaains.
Meanwhile a crowded train reached Les
Charonnes, the preceding station,' and the
officials, seeing smoke pouring out of the
tunnel, gave the alarm. A panic ensued,
the passengers struggling to escape from
the tunnel. Amid the Increasing smoke
many attempted to return along the line
toward Belleville and were suffocated.
The officials seem to have lost their heads
and are unable to say how many passen
gers went out. The firemen for several
hours were unable to enter. the station or
the tunnel, owing to the dense smoke,
which poured out in black. clouds. -. ? â¢;

of Â¦ English- diplomacy- should "not forget

Now the Government will make itself
responsible for the proper carriage and
delivery cf this mail, and to this end will
commission and pay salaries to trainmen
over and above the compensation received
ty them for their rr-sular work.
The policy adopted by the Government
is really an amplification of the system
which has been in use for some time by
publishers of papers, who serve subscri
bers en rural free delivery routes where
the mail train facilities are limited. It
has been the custom of these publishers
to intrust bundles of papers to trainman
on trains which did not carry United
States mails, with instructions to throw
them off at certain points. This system,
however, has been very unsatisfactory.
Postmaster General Payne and Second
Assistant Postmaster General Shallenber
ger have had the plan under considera
tion for months. The agitation, however,
which really led to the adoption of the
r.ew policy has been growing for several
years and, like eo many other important
*t+pa Â«.j. i-:. d *>>â¢ the PosiofUce Depart
ment in late years, this is a result of
the tremendous growth of the rural free
delivery service.
The purposed step will be accomplished
by commissioning railroad conductors,
baggage Aasters and other trainmen,
Â¦wherever desired, as employes of the
United States, postal service and empow
ering them to handle a desired class of
mail.
WASHINGTON. Aug. lO.-Postmaster
General Payne decided to-day to issue
slt, order which "will have the effect of
making practically every train in the
"United States a mail train and of plac
ing the railroads in their entirety under
the protection of the United States Gov
Â«":.iaem. Incidentally this will obviate
the possibility of interference with inter
state commerce and passenger traffic by
strikers, as in times past.

Combines With Capitalist of

the Big Deal.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SPOKANE. Aug. 10,-Rockefeller Inter
ests have joined hands with Charles
Sweeny of Spokane In forming the Fed
eral Mining and Smelting Company, with
a capital of J3O.OOO.O0O, to control the Coeur
d'AIene lead mines and engage in the
smelting business. The deal, which is
now being perfected in New York, is the
most important merger that has been at
tempted In the mining Industry since the
flotation of Amalgamated Copper. John
A. Finch, representing the Standard and
the Mammoth mines of the Coeur
d'Alenes, which will go into the combine.
Is now in New York perfecting details of
the transfer.
A. B. Campbell, Finch's partner, said
to-day: "It looks now as if the consolida
tion will go through. I feel confident
that the Rockefeller interests are behind
it. The deal will take in the Rockefeller
mines (the Monte Cristo) and the Ever
ett smelter, which are owned by^ them.
The deal is on the stock of the Standard
Company and Is not .for the property it
self. I am not particularly anxious to
see it go through, and I have not given
any kind of an option to my personal
holdings in the Standard. However, If
looks now as if It will be closed. I under
stand that there is $300,000 on deposit in
New York now as an initial payment on
the deal. The options which Mr. Sweeny
holds will expire September 1. I do not
care to state at what price the properties
will be turned over. I understand the
capital is JCO.OOO.OOO."
The Standard Company owns a three
eighths interest in" the Mammoth and
the neighboring property, which Is also
under option to the Sweeny- Rockefeller
interests. The Mammoth is perhaps fhÂ«
most valuable silver-lead mine In the
Coeur d'Alenes and It is held at about
J2.00O.O0O. It has- been paying dividends of
from J20.000 to J4O.00O a month for the past
three and a half years. The Standard
Company has paid up to date J2.S50.000 In
dividends In ten years.
It is expected that the Standard will be
turned over to the now syndicate on the
basis ot about $8 a share, or J3.000.000 for
the company's holdings. That surplus
above $1,250,000. to be paid for the re
maining five-eighths Interests tn the
Mammoth, would make the two properties
stand a little more than J4.00O.O0O.
The consolidation would Include also the
Tlger-Poorman group at Burke, Idaho,
and the Last Chance group at TVardaÂ«rÂ«
Idaho, owned by the Empire State- Ida no
Company. It has an issued capital of
$5,500,000 and is paying dividends of 6 per
cent a year.
* The three properties under one manage
ment would form the strongest silver-lead
combination in the Coeur d'Alenes, which
produces about 60 per c?nt of the argen
tiferous lead mined in the United States.
The options on the Standard and the
Mammoth were secured by Senator Tur
ner, acting on behalf of Charles Sweeny.

BELGRADE. Servta. Aug. 10.âAccord
ing to the latest reports received here re
garding: the murder of the Russian Consul
at Monastir. M. Rostkovoski abused the
Turkish gendarme, who was doing sentry
duty, for not saluting him. and called him
a "pig. of a Turk." Then he struck the
sentry with his whip, saying at the same
time, "Perhaps you will know me." Tha
gendarme thereupon fired on the Consul.
It is said that M. Rostkovoski was
hated by. thÂ« Turks on account of his In
tense arrogance.
M. Rostkovoski has been In Macedonia
for twenty years. He knew the Inside of
almost evÂ«ry village In the province and
was regarded as a friend of the Chris
tian^. He was a belWver In the tradition
that an overbearing manner was best In
dealing with Orientals. , .
Last May the Consul had an experience
apparently similar to the ,incldent which
led to his death. He went to the village
of Mogil. six miles north of Monastlr. to
Investigate the Turkish excesses there.
The Turkish troops had cordoned the vil
lage and a sergeant seized the brldlc3 of
M. . Rostkovoskl'3 horses and attempted to
stop the Consul. ' The latter raised h!3
cane and struck the sergeant. His action
placed him In Imminent danger until hl3
identity was revealed.

Macedonian Delegates State Their
Grievances Against Turkey.
SOFIA, Aug. 10.â The delegates here of
the Macedonian committee have . ad
dressed the following appeal to eaÂ£h of
the representatives of the Powers:
Your Excellencyâ The delegates of the Mace
donian committee have the honor to bring to
your notice the following resolutions, with the
request that you communicate them to your
Government:
The Mussulmans', systematic persecution has
compelled the Christians In Macedonia and
the vilayet of Adrianople to institute a gen
eral rising. They have had recourse to thla
extreme measure . after exhausting, all pacific
means to secure the Intervention of Europe
to enforce the provisions of the Berlin treaty.
At the present moment intervention is the
only means of remedying the evil and stop
ping bloodshed. The sporadic efforts of the
powers to secure reforms have failed; they
have resulted merely in a recrudescence of
Turkish fanaticism and greater oppression.
It is evident that reform measures, to be ef
ficacious, must Include .the appointment of a
Christian Governor General of Macedonia â
some one who has never held office under the
Porte, and who must be' Independent of the
Turkish Government in the exercise of- his
functionsâ and the further appointment by the
powers ef a Joint permanent administrative
board, with full power to deal with *ny dis
turbance.
Having published the foregoing facts to the
civilized world and made known the causes
which have driven the Macedonians to despair,
the committee for the Macedonians now In
arms proposes to continue the fight until the
object of their uprising has been attained. >

On the Nogales branch a hundred foot

Sunday night and k long bridge at Hua

so that tranic has been blocked for forty
eight -hours and passengers are being
carried to Nogales from Tucson by stage.
On the El Paso Southwestern road traf
fic has been blocked by the washout of
an important bridge at Lewis Springs. On
the Southern Pacific a cloudburst washed
out a long stretch of track west of Red
Rock and through trains were delayed
for hours. Passengers on the Crescent
City express were without food until the
arrival of the Sunset Limited, carrying a
dining-car.
The Southern Pacific expects to have
the bridges rebuilt and trains running on
the Nogales branch by Wednesday. The
main line opened' this afternoon and the
delayed trains, which had been annulled,
were continued as extras. The rains
which have continued during the past few
days have been the heaviest and most
general of the season.
The Sonora Railroad and the Nogale3
branch of the Southern Pacific are the
greatest sufferers and traffic has not yet
been resumed on these lines. Half a mile
of track at Morena, near Ortiz Station,
on the Sonora Railroad, was swept away
by the storm and special work trains had
to be sent out from both Hermosillo
and Guaymas carrying men and material

Railroad traffic on all lines was paralyzed
by the storm and cloudbursts washed
away long sections of track and bridges.
All through trains over the Southern Pa
cific were deldyed from twelve to twenty
four hours and' on other lines trains were
delayed at small stations, where some of
them yet remain waiting for the track
to be repaired or bridges to be rebuilt.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
To the correspondent of The Call Keck
showed letters to prove that Llttauer had
sent him at least one check as a reward
for "fixing" his bid for a lot of gloves at
a figure that would not interfere with
the bid made by William Top, whose fac
tory here was practically owned by Llt
tauer.
- Previous to 1836, when Llttauer was first
sent to Washington as Representative in
Congress, Xeck had been a contractor,
dealing with the Government with more
than fair success. In ten years he had
had twenty-five contracts for supplying
gloves and caps for the army, every ona
of the contracts having been obtained
after an open competition and an award
ing to the lowest bidder. Since 1S96 he
ha3 had only three minor contracts,
though on several occasions he has sub
mitted bids lower than those of his com
petitors. He charges that favoritism has
been shown, and though It is Impossible to
prove that it was done at the suggestion
of Littauer, the contracts have been
awarded to men who are little more than
Littauer's dummies, at figures above
those sbumitted by other bidders. Ha
gives dates to proye what he says and he
gives figures.
Keck charged .Llttauer with having con
spired with himself and others to keep
the price of gloves for the army at an
unnecessarily high figure. So far as it
was possible. Keck supplied proof of his
allegations and said that he would make
affidavits. He hopes that the investiga
tion which has been ordered by President
Roosevelt into contracts in which Lit
tauer is believed to have had an Interest
will be thorough and he bas given the
names of various manufacturers ot gloves
and others, who, be says, can give in
formation that will be of value if the in
vestigation is not for "whitewashing"
purposes.
JOHNSTOWN, N. T., Aug. 10.â In the
most direct manner possible, Timothy
Keck, a prominent citizen and well

tive in Congress from this district, with
having had an interest in various con
tracts obtained from the Government.

The fish hatchery has been doing an
immense business this year and only
recently 300,000 young trout were planted
in Mendoclno County Btreams. Of these
73.000 were placed In Reeves Mill Creek
this week. There are countless thousands
of young trout ready for transplanting
and they are being sent out as fast as
possible. water in the streams of
Mendocino~ County Is unusually low for
this season of the year, which is a dis
advantage in the placing of young fish.
- UKIAH, Aug. 10.â For- some time past
there has been a strange species of
fish noticed ; In a pool near the fish
hatchery here. One of the same was
gigged recently with a common
hay fork and thrown from the spring
which is the source of the pool. The
specimen was taken to Colonel LaMotte,
at the hatchery, who Is regarded as an
authority on things pertaining to species
of fish. He at once pronounced it an
Austrian mirror carp. This is one of the
most toothsome fish known, but tho man
ner in which they came to be planted in
this spring is not known. Old settlers
have known of this fish being in the
spring for many years, but did not give
'it '"sufficient thought' to ascertain its
species. In color it is golden, has a
decidedly pretty contour and is almost
without scales. The few scales possessed
by the fish are a dark golden color, mak
ing a decided contrast with tho lighter
hue of its body. Colonel LaMotte in
tends to make an investigation and de
termine if possible the manner in which
the species came to be transulanted in
that vicinity.
It is interesting in this connection to -note
that the numerous lynchlnKs In the North ami
Northwest of late have brought forth such an
expression from the President, while the num
ber of them In the South has been so few
within the same -period as to attract little or
no attention.

I think President Roos*vÂ»lt is on the rijrht

there should be a prompt and epeedy trial of

Court to-day rendered its decision in tRc

Andrews. The court disbars ex-Circuit
Judge A. S. Humphreys and Georgo A.
Davis. Frank Thompson is suspended
from practicing for one year. Attorney J.
A. .Magoon is exonerated. Justice Gal
braith rendered a dissenting opinion in all
of the cases. The court holds that
Humphreys is guilty of attempting to in
duce Magoon to betray. his client,; Sum
ner, and also of opposing his ex-clterit,
Sumner. Thompson is found puilty of op
posing his ex-client. Davis i3 found
guilty of , abusing a legal process. It
was alleged that he forced the aged Sum
.ner to pay him an exorbitant fee through
intimidation.* Justice Galbraith says, that,
Davis and Thompson aie deservitij; of
lighter punishment and that Magoon,, on
the charge of collecting an exorbitant
fee. is deserving of some punishment.!
- The disbarment proceedings grew but
of the case of John Sumner, an aged cap

against the attacks -of relatives who/al
leged that he was ; mentally Incompetent
and unable to handle his property. Mfiny

GUTHRIE, O. T., Aug. 10.â As a result
of a neighborhood feud â¢ William Cooper
and. his son, James Cooper, are dead and
Samuel Barrett severely wounded. 'They
were farmers living near Oleta. Wood
ward County. The parties met at a pub
lic well, and in ' the altercation young
Cooper shot Barrett .in the head with a!
load of fine shot. Barrett then seized a
shotgun. and killed both the Coopers. The

Kills His Two Assailants.
One of the other . hold-ups occurred
Wednesday night at Lombard and Stock
ton streets and the victim was relieved
of several dollars In money and a watch.
The following night another man wa3
robbed at Montgomery avenue and Broad
way. Both of these latter hold-ups were
committed by two men apd the descrip
tion given by their victims tallies with
that furnished of his assailants by True
worthy. One is said to be a large, heavy
eet man with a slouch hat, with a hag
gard face 'and close-cropped- hair. The
other is said to be smaller, wearing a
derby hat and a small dark mustache
and who looks like an opium fiend.
After the second robbery was reported
Captain Martin concluded that the per
petrators might have been Gordon and
some companion and accordingly the
three watches of patrolmen were notified
to keep a sharp outlook for men answer
ing the descriptions given. Since the
robbery of Trueworthy extra precautions
have been taken and four detectives are
engaged in endeavoring to apprehend the
footpad*. It appears altogether likely
thet Gordon has sought refuge in this
city, which would prove his best hiding
place if he managed to reach here In
safety. If he be concealed here, it Is
likely that his desire for opium . would
stimulate him to the commission of just
such crimes as these to obtain mone" for
the purchase of the drug. ,
Three hold-ups have occurred within
the last week on the North Beach dis
trict and the police department Is con
siderably exercised over them, believing
that there Is a possibility that the per
petrators are "Red Shirt" Gordon, one
of the escaped Folsom convicts, and a
companion with whom he has sought
refuge in this city.
The last robbery occurred Saturday
night, when Alonzo Trueworthy, proprie
tor of the Palace Baths at 715 Filbert
street, was halted by two men armed
with revolvers on Leavenworth street
near Union and $35 and a valuable gold
watch were taken from him. Trueworthy
had been at the Baths making up hid
accounts and started for his home at
1414 Green street about 11 o'clock. As he
turned into Leavenworth street he was
halted by, a command to hold up his
hands and found himself facing a brace
of revolvers In the hands of two men.
One of them kept him covered while the
other searched v him. When they had fin
ished they ordered him to proceed and
not to look back under penalty of death.
After he had gone half a block he turned,
but the robbers had disappeared. The
following day he reported the matter to
Captain of Detectives Martin.

So far the Southern Pacific has been-ad
vised of the coming of about seventy-five
special trains, of Â«whlch forty- four will be
turned over to the company by the Rio
Grande system at Ogden. About sixteen
trains will come through under the super
vision of-the Union Pacific and the others
will come -by way of the Sunset route or
be turned over by the Santa Fe road at
some point near Los Angeles. In fact the
latter' road will not have many through
specials, the majority of its Grand Army
traffic, being booked on the western trip
to San Francisco by way of Los Angeles.
It is with considerable effort that the
passenger department of the Southern
Pacific is gaining correct Information re
garding the west-bound trains. In fact
the only direct information that it has as
yet received is concerning the trains com
ing by, way of the Denver and Rio Grande
road. According to the reports made by
that company the greater number of its
special ..trains will be delivered to the
Southern Pacific . Company at Ogden on
August 12, 13, 14 and 15, and will be hur
ried along as fast as possible, arriving: in
this city on the 14th, 15. 16th and 17th. A
number of. the excursion parties have ar
ranged to â¢ stop over In Salt Lake long
enough to see the sights of the Mormon
city, rfnd this will delay their arrival here.

SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 10.â State Prison
Directors Wllkins and Felton appeared
before the Mann County Board of Super
visors this afternoon and asked that ths
county road between San Rafael and San
Quentin, known as the "Hill Road." bÂ»
abandoned as a public highway and made
a private road.
"This," said Director Felton. addressing
the board, "will not only insure the resi
dents of Marin County from an outbreak
of the convicts, but will also materially
assist us in preventing ex-cenvlcts and
others from 'planting* opium where trus
ties can smuggle it Inside the walls. We
have plaps whereby It will be practically
impossible for any convict to escape from
San .Quentin and if we get the road asked
for our guards will have far greater Juris
diction and can stop the smuggling o"
contraband goods. We will build another
road for the county leading to San Quen
tin, but on a more circuitous route. Our
plan?, when consummated, will make Saa
Quentin one ot the finest penal Institu
tions in America. Folsora at the present
time is no more than a hotel or picnic
grounds, and 13 practically unprotected,
but our plans will also render that place
a prison to be admired and not ridiculed
as It Is to-day."
Director Wllkins to-night, in speaking
of the concession asked for to-day, said:
"Our beard has plans for a great many
changes in San Quentin. In order to carry
out ,our plans we will try to get a targa
appropriation from the next Legislature.
One of the greatest changes inside thÂ«
walls will be the demolition of the larg*
brick building formerly use 1 as a furni
ture factory. We will erect in its stead a
lcrge number of cells. More watch tow
ers will be built and the scope of terri
tory for the guards to 'cover will be In
creased. We have had a great deal of
trouble with 'Hill Road.' Ex-convlcts
and others' unknown have bo*n continu
ally using that read as a means of smug
gling contraband goods into the prison.
We have found opium in large quantities
buried alongside > the road as well as re
volvers and dynamite at different time*.
Our guards, as It now stands, cannot
stop this cacheing. as they cannot molest
people on the public highway." *

With this story as a clew a posse pro
ceeded toward the summit this afternoon,
but the general feeling Is that further
pursuit would be useless. Tho profes
sional trailers who joined the 7ZI Dorado
County posse yesterday separated from
the peace officers and each other to-day
in order to pick up the tracks again.
W'yatt and Gignac took different courses
in the heavily timbered section to the
kft abd Co!bin turned to the right.
The convicts were headed due east at
last accounts. The last actual trace of
the outlaws was at the old Plummer
fhtep ranch, where Berue and Bowman
v ere held up and robbed Saturday. Many
of the posse are certain, however, that
the convicts had surely been tracked to
Devils Elide. Norman would enter this
I>lace with his men, as though the El
Dorado County man-hunters were positive
that the fugitives had taken that course.
The Amador County posse was well provi
sioned at the time and comparatively
fresh, but the Sheriff was inclined to
think the quarry was going to Silver Lake
and took that course himself after argu
ment.
The Placc-rvlile officials are puzzled at
Norman's conduct on the chase.
The man-hunters to-day obtained what
â¢was considered reliable information con
cerning the location of. the convicts yes
terday afternoon Sxora W. . J. Rhoades,
who is in the employ of Easton, Kldridge
& Co. at San Francisco. He is camping
in the mountains with several companions
a few miles west of Silver Lake. In con
versation with a Call representative to
day Rhoades said: "About 3 o'clock yes
terday afternoon I went to the door of
oar cabin and looking up the hillside
eaw a man Etep cautiously from behind
a big pine tree and take a survey of the
surrounding country. I thought he acted
suspiciously, particularly as lie did not
approach our cabin, which Is the only
one for miles around. People always stop
there in pushing through this region. I
went to the rear of the house and called
to my companions to come and take a
look at the stranger. When we returned
to the door he dodged out of fefght and
dfd nut appear again. The innj\ Â«ai
armed with a rifle, but I could not tell
much about him."
TRAILERS LEAVE POSSE.
The Amador County and El Dorado
County pcsFtS met and compared notes
to-day* and it was decided after Â¦ lengthy
conference that Norman and his detach
ment of mountaineers should travel as
fi.st as possible by a short cut to Silver
LalieTwhich uiay be the objective point
of the fugitives, while Cook anl his men
will resume the chase at a slower pace.
C. E. Fcrrell, in charge of the blood
hounds, stated to-day that if the convicts
Â¦were r.ct located by to-morrow he should
advise that pursuit be abandoned.
PLACERVILLE, Aug. 13.â Tho El Do
rado County posse, commanded by Gilbert
Cook, has practically abandoned pursuit
of the five convicts, who are hastening
toward the Nevada line. The peace offi
cers are nearly exhausted and the* trail
was becoming blind this afternoon. Sher
iff Norman of Aniador County and his
posse have gone to Silver Lake to head
off and arsbush the outlaws. The fugi
tives traveled faster than the pursuers
and their present whereabouts is again
only a matter of conjecture. Cook's
posse started out en a fresh trail yes
terday shortly after daylight and con
tinued the pursuit all day with little rest.
The convicts showed remarkable' ability

FORT DE FRANCE, Martinique. Auf.
10.â The island of Martinique was swept
'by a hurricane of great violence last
night. Its duration was ten hours and
It was particularly severe during two
hours at Fort de France, where It caused
much destruction.
Martin says the robber was about five
feet seven or eight Inches tall. His hair
was black and there was about three
weeks' growth of beard on hi* face. Ue
wore no coat. His trousers, originally of
light material, were torn and grimy with
dirt. He was armed with a rifle and re
volver. He looked worn and haggard.
Frank Slinger claims that he saw a man
of the same description ir the same ppot
yesterday. He thought nothing particular
cf it. having seen so many wornout look
ing men with arms traveling through the
country lately.
Bosquit says that as Case is sick and
a dope fiend as well, there should be lit
tle difficulty in capturing or killing him.
The miner needed no second invitation,
and started down the read at a brisk
pace. He gave the .alarm immediately.
The scene of the hold-up was near John
Rawlins' house, and Sheriff Bccqult and
posse went there as soon as possible. The
ravine is covered with brush and timber
and affords many excellent hiding places.
It became dark shortly after the arrival
of the man-hunters and the pursuit had
to be abandoned. -
SEARCH MADE FOR CASE.
Sheriff Bosquit and his deputies feel cer
tain that Convict Frank Case is near this
city. A man answering his description
was seen yesterday, and again to-day.
James Martin, a miner, was held up by a
man supposed to be the convict at 5:30
o'clock this afternoop and robbed of a
dinner pall filled with food. A posse was
sent out and made rough but fruitless
search of the locality where the robbery
occurred. Pursuit will be resumed to
morrow. Martin is employed at. the I-an
decker mine. He set out from what is
known as Upper Town, In Placerville, and
was walking leisurely toward the mine,
in Cedar Ravine, which is less than a mile
southeast of the postoffice. *In a lonely
section of the road a man stepped out
from the bushes a few feet distant and
said. "Here, there, you fellow; come
hire." As the stranger had a rifle and
seemed determined Martin obeyed. The
highwayman grabbed the dinner pail and
said, "Now, you go, and go fast."
Devils Slide Is worthy of its name.
Those who have visited the locality state
that the place is filled with hiding places
and that at many points two men could
stand off fifty. Food and animal life is
scarce there, and human beings could not
remain there long unless supplied with
provisions from the outside. Devils Slide

bowlders, many of them as large or larger
than The Call building, are strewn, on

noes covers much of the ground. The
timber is heavy and the undergrowth is
almost impenetrable. The convicts have
supplies sufficient to last several days.
Cook says he will stay with the chase un
til the last vestige of hope has disap
peared. Many of his companions are con
vinced that the hunt should be aban
doned.
Word was conveyed to the men at work
and they followed the women to compel
a speedy return. Words were of -no avail
and resort was Jiad to force. The men
used the whips they had for their horses
and oxen and the unclad cortege was soon
broken and in homeward flight. Many of
the women were badly injured by the
blows of the lashes.

more than 2000 started on a pilgrimage in
search of Jesus, only to be called to a
halt by mounted police, driven into a cor
ral and bundled off to their homes on
closely guarded trains, religious excite
ment has been smoldering in the far
away villages of the colony of this'
Btrange Russian sect. About a week ago
a woman agitator named Sophia Stor
boloff managed to obtain a following
in one of the settlements back of Swan
River. The men were away at work in
the fields some miles from their homes
and in their absence she wrought up the
females to such a pitch that they all dis
carded their clothing and prepared to'fol
low her on a Journey in search of the
Christ.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
There was a profound silence in the
court room during Madame Humbert's
declaration, but her final words again
putting off the promised disclosures
aroused derisive laughter.' When the
court intimated that the statement was
vague, Maitre Laborl answered:
. "But Madame Humbert engages herself
to speak at the close of the hearing."
The court then began the examination
of the ninety witnesses j called, outside
the family, which will occupy many days.
Madame Therese's declaration that the
Crawfords actually exist \under another
name is generally regarded as only an
other of her ruses to gain time.
The Judge, interrupting her, asked:
"Then where are the Crawfords?" Ma
dame Humbert replied:
If the Crawfords do not come here I will
give their name and that will suffice. I have
already told Maltrtf Labor! that when the wlt
nessesâ-have been heard and the hearing is
concluded I will tell all.
1 have tried to C. 1. the Crawfords and their
millions. I have not succeeded in finding the
money, but I have found the Crawfords. They
have made a terrible revelation to me. I have
told Maitre Labor! all. He knows the real
name of the Crawfords. for they do not call
themselves by the name of Crawford. No one
will suffer any loss. 1 will pay every one.
Perhaps the Crawfords may not appear, but
they exist. It is only their name that _, does
not exist. :
Madame Humbert here made another
declamatory statement, protesting her
complete innocence. She said:
The examination of Romalne d'Aurlg
nac, Madame Humbert's brother, brought
out nothing new.
Romalne d'Aurignac testified that Ma
dame Therese commissioned him to trace
the whereabouts of the Crawford broth
ers. Once, he said, when Crawford vis
ited his residence he followed him to the
Grand Hotel de Louvre and located the
room occupied by Robert and Henry
Crawford. The former was sick in bed
and refused to get' up, but Henry came
to the door and after a brief conversa
tion accepted copies of some legal papers.
The Judge sought to bring out that Ro
malne himself impersonated the,Craw
fords and instituted suits in their name.
The defendant denied ever impersonating
the Crawfords or writing the letters
signed by the Crawfords.
"WILL FIND CBAWFOBDS.
Frederic' Humbert testified lengthily re
garding the affairs of the Rente Viaegre,
the insurance concern which the Hum
berts started and In the crash of .which
thousands of poor people lost all their
savings. , He .-maintained, that the opera
tions were conducted in good faith and
claimed that public prejudice a aroused
against the Humbert family ' brought
about the failure of the concern. He de
nied the Judge's statement that the
rooms in the palatial residence of the
Humberts in the -Avenue de la Grande
Acmes were connected by a system of
secret telephones. Madame Therese here
also -exclaimed: "Lies; more lies." Fred
eric Humbert said he had devoted most
of his time to art and poetry, leaving
the entire financial operations to hid
wife.
FBEDEKIC TESTIFIES.
The Judge, however, proceeded with the
examination of the other defendants,
despite M. Humbert's constant interrup
tions. During Judge Bonnet's searching
interrogation of her husband, Madame
Therese dramatically exclaimed: "Mon
ster le President: You are clearly show
ing by your manner that you are against
ur. You should disguise your feelings
and try to appear impartial."
The spectators were greatly amused at
this outburst. The Judge orderedN Ma
dame Humbert to be silent, but she again
shouted: "You are continually showing
your prejudice."
PARIS, Aug. 10^-The Humbert trial to
day drew another large crowd to the
Palais de Justice. Madame Therese
Humbert continued to dominate the pro
ceedings and created several scenes
when the court attempted to examine the
members of the family. M. Bonnet, the
presiding Judge, insisted on examining
Frederic Humbert, her husTxind, but
Madame Therese, rising, said: "I de
mand to be heard. I am strong to-day
and will explain where the millionaires
are." .'

Colonel Thomas C. Woodbury, who suc
ceeds General Coolidge in command of
the Dost and the regiment, is a West
Pointer, having entered the academy in
1868. He is regarded as a soldier of ex
traordinary gallantry and merit. Before
being assigned to the Seventh Regiment
he was a major of the Nineteenth , In

friends that he will soon succeed to a
full colonelency and bis present subordi

While the names of its battles have been

"Surely."- he Fay?, "we cannot deny the
rlpht we claimâ the right to organizeâ
and It is not aside from the probabilities
that through this era of organization may
come the era of peace."
The report refers to the arbitration
agreement with the American Newspaper
Publishers' Association, which has been
fn operation for more than two years, and
pays that all but two disputes have been
settled )n a fairly satisfactory manner
and that there is much better genera!
feeling existing between the two organ
izations. The International Typographi
cal Union, he says, wax -the first to nego
tiate a general arbitration agreement, and
adds that thus far the union has. car
ried it out faithfully and with an earnest
desire to promoÂ»fe and secure industrial
peace with their 'employers.
"If, however." the report says, "the
arbitration agreement is juggled with by
unscrupulous individuals and made the
vehicle for unjust and questionable de
cisions, through the . connivance of any
interested party, thus the cause of arbi
tration and necessarily the cause of in
dustrial peace will receive a' blow ifrom
which recovery will not be possible for
years."
The report expresses regret at the ten
dency on the part. of the trade unionists
to make light of the unions of employers
and questions whether it would not be
better to display a tolerant spirit toward
them in the hope of establishing friendly
relation?.

Etandstni In the manufacturing Jewelry trade
to-day as a result of the' lockout by the New
York Manufacturing Jewelers' Association. .
OAKLAND, Aug. 10.â The police , were
called this afternoon to take charge of
V. P. Mitchels, a sign painter, who was
found ln a vacant lot at Twenty-fifth
street and San Pablo avenue, apparently
under -the Influence of liquor. He was
taken to the city prison, being booked
there at 4:40, o'clock as drunk. The jail
ers noticed something wrong about the
man and sent for Health OflJcer Von
Adelung, but at 6:30 o'clock, twenty min
utes before the physician arrived, - Mit
chels was dead. The Coroner took charge
of the body and will hold an autopsy to
morrow. Mitchels was 40 years old. He
resided at 1804 Market street.
Sign Painter Found Dying.
OAKLAND, Aug. 10.â The condition of
William D. English, manager of the
Contra Costa Water Company, who is
critically ill at East Bay Sanitarium,
showed very slight improvement to-day,
although there was no gain that could
be reckoned as permanent. Since the
operation last Saturday the patient has
been in a semi-conscious state and all
of the symptoms show a very severe
prostration from, the shock of the sur
geons' second attempt to relieve the
serious disorder In the abdomen. With
a temperature that remains normal, the
pulse is very rapid, an indication of quite
unfavorable aspect. "Vitality generally,
however, is at a low stage and this gives
rise to fears very grave Jndeed for the
final result of the heroic efforts to re
lieve the sufferer's, serious affliction.
.While the attending physicians, Dr. D.
D. Crowley and Dr. Frank Adams, are
not ready to give a decision upon the
outcome, they do not announce any posi
tive declaration of hope for recovery.
The patient's chamber is closely guarded,
nurses being in constant attendance and
none other than physicians or members
erf the immediate family are permitted
there.
Little Improvement Is Shown in
Patient and Surgeons Give
Small Hope.. .

GUTHRIB. O. T., Aug. 10.â William
Henry, who was sent to the Illinois peni
tentiary in 1901 to serve a fourteen-year
sentence for forgery and who escaped
shortly afterward, was arrested in this
city to-day. He married here a short time
ago and quarreled with his wife, who in
formed the Sheriff of Christian County,
Illinois, of the whereabouts of the fugi
tive.

There is large Interest being taken by
the musical and x -lashlonable sets in the
Scheel symphony concerts, the first of
which will take place next Friday after
noon at the Grand ODera-house at 3:15
sharp. The affair promises to be a so
ciety event as well as a musical festival,
applications for tickets having come in
from the traveling fashionables from all
quarters. The local sale of seats has also
been highly encouraging, and a notable
success for the series Is confidently hoped
for. Rehearsals for the concerts are now
In active progress. Herr Ferdinand Stark
has been appointed concertmeister and
an orchestra of seventy is ranged under
Herr Scheel's baton. The programme is
excellent and runs as follows: Overture,
"In Spring." Goldmark: Symphony No. 2,
C major. Schumann: Suite Op. 43, No. 1,
Tschalkowsky (first time); overture,
"Tannhauser" (by request).
Seats for the concerts are on sale at
Sherman & Clay's, and applications /or
membership in the San Francisco Sym
phony Society may be made to Shatter
Howard, room 91, Crocker building.
This man who was lifted from a wagon to a
position of $4000 a year and smote the hand
which raised him. says with a humor all hi*
own that he UÂ» content with his present sta
tion. But wha^ will Casey do to-morrow night
when the votes arevcounted? (Voice, "Commit
suicide.").
We have contended that It was for the In
terest of ourselves to preserve this Union La
bor party as a club to be used against the ag
gressions of capital, and we believe the man
who would countenance the disintegration of
this party to be a traitor to our cause. Now,
Casey and his followers know this, but . they
are endeavoring to deceive you and to deliver
over to Phelan and McNab the party to which
Walter Gallagher arose, despite repeat
ed shouts for Schmitz, and gave Casey a
sound verbal drubbing. In part he said:
ONE COURSE OPE2T.
Thomas F. Egan of the Painters* Union
was the next speaker. He said in part:
' After having chosen for our utandard-bearer
end elected for Mayor "that gallant champion
of labo?, Eugene E. Schmitz. must we turn
back to official corruption the city now dom
inated by friends of labor? I *ay we must
go forward, and there must be no middle
ground, no compromise. There is no other
hope for the wage-earner. : 'Â¦-'-'
No official in the older parties dare stand
for labor. Then why should we look to either
of these parties for relief? Can it be urged
that the entire community has not profited by
the election of Eugene E. Schmitz?
The simple proposition Is: Has the adminis
tration of Eugene E. Schmitz been such as
to lead you. to continue him in office? If not.
you allow us to be dragged back to the con
ditions existing two years ago. and place us
again under the domination of Gavin McNab
and Phelan.
under Casey and they must do as he pleases.
That is why they passed a resolution de
nouncing Mayor Schmltz. The people na\e

The county committee appointed a commit
tee of three to draft a constitution for the
district clubs and all delegates elected by the
district clubs had to be submitted to this com
mittee, which had the power to accept or
reject the delegates. ?
A committee of five was also appointed and
called a committee on qualifications to pass
on the merits of the delegates elected by thÂ«
district clubs. That committee was composed
of Casey Mott. a teamster for the Board of
Public Works; Superintendent McLaughlln or

Now you can understand that Michael Casey
was the entire committee and the others had
to do his bidding. One man had the po Â»er to
pass on all delegates. If Casey had any sense
he would be ashamed of himself.

edged this fact their ticket would not receive
200 votes In this city. Their Intention Is to
elect a Democrat for Mayor and Michael Casey
or some of his Ilk for Sheriff.
When Mayor Schmitz was elected he pledged
that policemen would not be allowed on the
cars in case of a strike. Has he kept that
pledge? (Cries of "Yes, Yes"). Then If he
has failed in everything else, for that and that
alone, every worklnsrman In San .Francisco
should vote for him this year.
MAYOR SCHMITZ SFEAXS.
When Mayor Schmitz arose at the in
troduction of the chair a perfect pande
monium of cheers broke forth. Women
waved hats and handkerchiefs and - men
stood on chairs better to voice their en
thusiasm. He said in part:
If It needed any evidence to show your con
fidence In behalf of my administration an
Mayor of the city of my birth, tha reception
you have given me to-night amply furnishes
It. I stand here to-night not as Mayor, but as
a native born son of San Francisco, and from
the bottom of my heart I thank you.
A great deal has been said to-night of Mr.
Michael Casey. I do not wish to speak 111 of
any man. I do not wish to bolster up my
cause by tearing 'down another. In the words
of Shakespeare, <"God made him for a man;
therefore . let him pass." But I do want tr>
say that the contests brought about In the
ranks of the Union Labor party were engineered
not by the friends but the enemies of the
party. . I am content to stand before thÂ« peo
ple of San Francisco and be denounced by the
bosses and vile sycophants who are now abus-
Inc me.
We stand on record as being pledged to put
a pure Union Labor ticket in the field, ard
the delegates sent out by the faction I repre
sent have the audacity to pledge themselves
to my renominatlon as Mayor. That la the
whole issue. If you are satisfied with my ad
ministration, if' you believe in my efforts to
bring about a better understanding between
employer and employe. If you believe I hav*
done . anything- to engage your support, then
vote for the delegates put forth by the faction
I represent.
Much has been said of the carmen's Ktrik*
in this city and of the part I took in it I
wish to say here that whatever be the atti
tude of the president of the Carmen's Union
In thin present flKht. I have not lost the least
faith In the carmen themselves, and I am con
fident that ninety-nine out of one hundred will
cast their votes for the ticket representing me.
I want to say in conclusion that I am will-
Ing to place myself In your hands. I am will
ing to leave it with you as to whether or not
I shall continue my service. I sincerely be
lieve that my renomlnatlon Is for thÂ« best In
terest of the wage-earners of San Francisco,
and if I did not not. I would not seek renom

Attorney W. J. Bajtnett, who represents
the Western Pacific Railroad Company,
will also attend the hearing, as'lhe navi
gability of the Mokelumne River Is likely
to affect freight ratos of the corporation
when it is ready for business.
The matter of the navigability of the
river has been agitated by Fred Harvey,
a large landowner, and the Supervisors of
Sacramento and San Joaquin counties are
opposed to having the river declared
navigable, as it will entail considerable
expense to build a new bridge at Benson
Ferry or convert it Into a drawbridge to
allow the passage cf a dredger. Sacra
mento County will be represented by
Chairman of the Board of Supervisors M.
2. Dillman, Supervisors Thomas Jenkins,
County Surveyor J. C. Boyd, Judge H.
McCune and Peter Glann. Fred Harvey
is thought to be back of the agitation, for
it is said he wants a job of dredging, or
has axes to grind.
San Joaquin County will be represented
by Supervisor Kewton. District Attorney
Â¦of the county, Arthur Thornton, and a
number of witnesses will also be on hand.
The question as to whether the Mokel

Cfcairman Frank Otis of the executive

however, was made that strong opposi

Late yesterday afternoon opposition was
put forward in the Thirty-seventh Dist

day, although M. Jasper McDonald,
chairman of the Democratic County Com

concerning the opening hour, but all au

at 5 p. m.
The fight in the Union Labor camp is
extremely bitter. The onlookers incline to
the opinion that the Schmitz wing will

meeting at the Alhambra last night than
Casey had at the same place last Satur

may come up in time to save the day at

1 Forty-fourth District â J. George Eoyne,
It Is not difficult, to see through the crooked
acts' of ' the so-called leaders of the Union La
bor party who . are opposed - to us. I know
what I am talking about, for I was a mem
ber of their county committee until two weeks
ago I knew that there was dissension and
strife' but I thought that the opposing fac
tion would finally return to the support of our
standard-bearer. Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz.
I was mistaken and that is why I have left
them and havÂ£ thrown my lot In *wlth Mayor
Schmitz and his lollowers. It has been. said
by the other faction that we are pirates and
lob-chasers. - They lied. They are like the
thief who seeks to divert attention from him
self by running down the street and calling
an honest man . a thief to fool the pursuers.
The other faction Is composed of Job-chasers,
and I will tell you why.
MJchaer Casey is a hypocrite and a traitor.
The Mayor made him chairman of the Board
of Public Works and that position placed him
on the Board of Health. Casey no sooner was
In power than he swelled up and got the big
head Michael Casey the teamster was a far
different being from Michael Casey. Commis
sioner of Public Works and member of the
Board of Health. He showed his crafty meth
ods at once. He saw the opportunity to build
up a. political machine and he made a combine
with the Board of Health, and you know what
a Board of Health It was. The attacks made
on the Board of Health bv a certain newspaper
ceased just as soon as Michael Casey became
a member Casey also made a combine with
Manson of the Board of Public Works, who is
a Democrat. Then Casey came to a meeting
of the county committee of the Union Labor
Darty which he controlled, and he tendered
the committee a long list of the places he
desired to fill with his own supporters. This
committee which calls us pirates and Job
chasers, grabbed at that list like a hungry
cat after a piece of liver. tThey went down
.1,. - ti ne . and as each place was Â¦ mentioned
there was an applicant for 1U Some of the

School Director A. Roncovieri was then
introduced to the gathering and ho re
ceived a hearty welcome. In part he said:
I rejoice to see this great outpouring of the
followers of unionism and supporters of our
valiant and true standard-bearer. Eugene B.
Schmitz. This meeting is a rebuke to those
who seek to destroy the Union Labor party by
dividing it into factions. The few misguided
men and traitors who have created the op
posing faction seek . to turn you against our
true and loyal leader. If you take their ad
vice and turn down the Mayor, you invite de
feat "and disaster to the union cause.
True unionism means the betterment of
American workmen, and it is necessary for all
lovers of unionism to march In solid array and
solidify our principles. There is no better
way to do this than by giving all our support
to the valiant standard bearer who led us to
victory two years aco.
I believe In unionism being in politics, for
it is most necessary. There is nothing our
workmen can ask If they will only stand to
gether at the polls. The ware-earners have
been buffeted between Republicanism and
Democracy. The time has now arrived for
the permanent existence of the Union Labor
party and It must bo preserved and perpet
uated in San -Francisco if you desire peace
and prosperity. Its defeat at the present time
will be a sign of weakness, and If the enemy
can defeat our leader the party will be de
stroyed. We shall and must elect Eugene E.
Schmitz. for we have every reason to feel proud
of him and what he has done. You cannot
without disgrace and base ingratitude with
draw your support from him at this time.
He has proven his worth and you must stand
by him. By his election trades unionism now
receives its proper recognition on all sides.
This condition should prevail all_ over the
country If Mayor Schmitz Is riot re-elected
the Union Labor party will never be heard
Â° He^has been faithful to all his pledges and
he has well stood the test of public . of flee.
None can say aught against him. He stands
clean and pure in public and private life and
he has been a faithful man to all.
Where would Michael Casey be If the Maypr
had not taken him from obscurity? TVhere
would Richard Cornelius be but for the firm
stand taken by the Mayor during the streetcar
strikes? Would the streetcar company and
the telephone company be ready to arbitrate
their differences but for the attitude of Mayor
Schmitz? The Mayor refused to allow the
hlrelmgs of the corporations to be armed In
order that they might bludgeon and perhaps
kill the men who went on strike.
Remember these things to-morrow when you
go to the polls. San Francisco, has never had
a Mayor who arbitrated so many dif ncultles so
satisfactorily as Mayor Schmitz has done. The

SCHMITZ THE ISSUE.
In calling the meeting to order Chair
man Mlllmore said:
I have been requested to act as chairman this
evening, and It affords me great pleasure to
do Â»o and to have our worthy Mayor on this
platform. There Is much discussion as to
which faction of the Union Labor party Is
the right one to support and which one Is in
the right. Your gathering here to-night shows
which faction you evidently think is the right
one. As chairman of the first convention
held in this city of the Union Labor party, it
gives me pleasure to preside here to-night.
There is no need for me* to eulogixe the acts
of Mayor Schmitz. for you all know what
he han done since he assumed office. He has
faithfully carried out all the pledges he made
before elecjUon, and has given special privi
leges to none and equal privileges to all. I feel
sure that the teamsters of this city will not
forget the man who kept the police from being
armed and placed on the street cars during
the big strike, despite the claims of certain
so-called labor leaders. By your votes to
morrow you must announce that Eugene E.
Schmitz shall be Mayor of this city for an
other term, and thus support him as our
valiant standard-bearer of the Union Labor
party.
THE wing of the Union Labor party
supporting: Mayor Eugene Schmitz
In the pending: campaign lield a
ratification meeting last, evening
at the Alhambra Theater, which
was crowded to its capacity.
The various speakers who addressed the
gathering dwelt . upon the qualifications
and record of the Mayor and. vehemently
denounced Michael Casey, who is at the
head of the labor faction that is opposed
to the re-election of Mayor Schmitz on
the labor party ticket. Â¦ .
Previous to the opening of the meeting
a band discoursed popular airs in front
of the theater, and a large quantity of
campaign literature was distributed to
those who entered the theater. A large
number of police officers was on hand to
preserve peace in case members of the
opposing factions might clash, but there
was no sign of disorder, either inside or
outside the theater. A man who was dis
tributing circulars which contained an at
tack on Mayor Schmitz was arrested for
violating a city ordinance. Beyond this
incident the meeting was not disturbed in
any manner.
The /eftrences by the speakers to Mayor
Schmitz*"were all loudly applauded, while
the mention of the name of Michael
Casey drew hisses and groans from all
parts of the house.
Joseph Mlllmore presided at the meet
ing, and among those on the platform

The Board of Education has resumed its Sway over
â¢the schools, newly opened, and not a single sugges
tion of nepotism or scandal has yet marred the scene.
If experience be any teacher this is. probably the lull
before the storm. We can always rely on the School
Board for several sensations during each school
term.
The young lady of Oakland who has been forced
by the police, at the intercession of her mother, to
stifle her ambition to go upon the stage, is hardly
old enough to realize wfiat a sweeping benefit has
been won to her and an enduring public. Some day
she will reflect what some Oaklanders have done to
the stage and she will be glad that she was not an
accessory.
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S letter to Gover
nor Durbin of Indiana commending him for
his resolute action in upholding the law of the
land against a mob of lynchers'will do much to con
firm and to augment the growing public sentiment in
favor of dealing summarily with violent offenders
against the good order of society and the dignity of
American law. ,
It is to be noted that Mr. Roosevelt writes not, as
President of the United States but as a citizen. His
opening words are: "Permit me to thank you as an
American citizen for the way in which you have vin
dicated the majesty of the law by your recent action
in reference to lynching." That of course is the
proper way .for Mr. Roosevelt to> speak. Our system
of government does not admit of a President so far
interfering with State affairs as to either condemn or
approve officially of what a Governor has done or
left undone, and accordingly Mr. Roosevelt carefully
avoided all captious objections on that score by ex
pressly stating that he wrote hot as President but.as
a private citizen, exercising the American right of
declaring his conviction on every subject of public
concern. Â«
While the people will recognize the tact of Mr.
Roosevelt in avoiding anything like an official super
vision of the conduct of the. Governor, they will none
the less bear in mind that he is after all President of
the United States; that his letter is an expression of
the commendation of the chief magistrate of the re
public, and as such the great mass of the American
people will approve and indorse it. â Â¦'
In truth the frequency of' lynching of late ; has
become a matter of serious import to the country.
As the President says: "The well beingâ indeed the
very existenceâ of the republic depends upon that
orderly liberty under the law which is as incompatible
with mob violence as with any , other form of des
potism. Of course mob, violence is simply one form
of anarchy, and anarchy is now, as it always will be,
the handmaiden and forerunner of tyranny." â¢> That
truth isone which for some strange reason consid
erable numbers of people* seem to have forgotten. It
is therefore imperative to have it reasserted sjgainfarid
again by every man whose voice commands public at
tention. Â¦ Â¦ '
ROOSEVELT TO DURBIN.
P^ ROFESSOR LANGLEY and Thomas A. Edi
son are men who have done much, but each of
them has promised so much more than he has
done that they may be rightly spoken of* as the two
most promising men in America. If we could have
had prompt realization of all the promises of these
gifted men we would ourselves as a people have been
gifted by this time, and fish would not be in it with us
as navigators of the under depths of the' sea, nor the
birds as travelers along the trackless wastes of air.
For a long time past Professor Langley has been
promising a flying machine that would make the
dirigible balloon look like a summer toy with a
string on it, and only a few days ago he went down
the Potomac to "make good." With much curiosity
and some large expectations the public waited for the
next news. First we learned that a storm had come
along and shaken some of the mechanism of the craft
out of gear. Next came a report that certain bel
ligerent clubmen had ordered Langley to take his
machine out of their house and their grounds. Then
came the climax. The machine when released on her
experimental trip rose gallantly and swiftly in the
air. For as much as three minutes the experiment
was a grand success. After that time something hap
pened. The spectators saw the soaring machine sud
denly turn her tail up and her nose down and make
a plunge for the river. Driven by her powerful en
gines she struck the water with such force as to cleave
clean through it and bury her nose so far in the mud
that if took a dredger to get her out.
So disappointing a result from an experiment of
which so much was promised would unquestionably
have saddened the American people for at least nine
days had they been left to meditate upon it. Fortu
nately no meditation has been permitted them. The
same day that brought the news of the failure of
Langley's promise brings us news of another promise
from Edison, so we can turn from the spilt milk of
the flying machine to enjoy the cream of what prom
ises an automobile for every family and two for those
who are greedy.
Mr. Edison now promises to construct immedi
ately a motor and a battery of such a design and so
light that it can be fitted to the body of any existing
four-wheeled vehicle and which, when thus attached,
will drive. that vehicle over an ordinary country. road
at a rate of twenty-five miles an " hour. There is a
promise big enough to console us for the loss of our
expected flying machine. Perhaps Mr. Edison may
in a few weeks try his motor. .Then we shall see
MEN OF PROMISE.
It is expected that in a few days a Seattle news
paper man will have finished a trio around the world
in fifty-five days. Even the extravagance of tha
riotous imagination of a Verne was not equal to the
possibilities and wonders of modern progress.
A new plot of murderous design has been hatched
in Servia because the assassins of Alexander and
Draga have not been honored by promotion in of
ficial service. It is not altogether improbable there
fore that King Peter, reflecting that murder placed
him upon a throne, may decide that the same expe
dient shall keep him there.
It is not a far cry back to 1896, only seven years,
but what greater change could be than the abandon
ment, even by silver countries, of the divine ratio of
r6 to I insisted upon by Mr. Bryan as necessary to
the prosperity of nations and the industrial salvation
of the world!
His party proposes to repent of its sins of that
time. But when one measures the offense by its pos
sible and natural consequences had it been crystallized
into a policy by the success of its advocates it rises to
such awful stature as to require that repentance be
impressed by penance, probation and apology.
In the progress of the commission through Europe
there h2s been no manifestation of life in the free
silver movement. The followers of'Henri Cernuschi
in the states of the Latin union have all disappeared.
In the honeymoon of Mr. Bryan's career he was
actively supported by that school, and even Balfour
in England moved uneasily and unwisely toward the
Nebraskan's position. European socialists, too, were
impressed by the arguments of the Democratic
leader. But now there is no like sign from any quar
ter. The 1896 phase of the issue, which had such
sympathy and support abroad, has been settled by the
United States in favor of the gold standard. Since
that world adjustment was made there have been
steady accessions to the roll of gold standard coun
tries. As soon as an international ratio is settled it
ma? be expected that more recruits will come. Ap
parently .Mexico is only waiting for that event. In
every capital visited by our ratio commission its
members have found the representatives of China
keenly and intelligently alive to the issue, and it may
well be that that vast empire^ will begin its needed
internal reforms by following Japan into the gold
standard camp.
titments arc cut out to the clean question of ratio.
The gold standard countries use, as we do, silver for
currency and for token or subsidiary coins. Like the
United States they arc all subject to the fluctuations
of silver bullion, and as their coinage ratio at present
is so far from the commercial ratio they find their
silver currency an element of disturbance.
Our commission finds the European powers quite
ready to discuss the question and reach a solution
which will leave less margin between the artificial or
coinage ratio and the average commercial difference
between the two metals. There is a general conviction
that actual values will never again closely approxi
mate the former and existing coinage ratio. For a
long time France, even under the gold standard, has
stubbornly insisted that her ratio of 1S 1 A to I Was the
best that could be reached. The other gold countries
have disbelieved this, but have made no move for %
ratio reform. France now seems to willingly give it up,
and ;vith the others agree that silver will never again
have the commercial value of $1.2929 per ounce as
when she set her existing ratio. It is reported by our
* ...
commissioners that she assents to a new ratio of 31
to I or one-half her present standard.
The attractive reason for a new ratio, offered by the
American*, is that it is necessary to the financial' sta
bility of the Oriental countries. The leading Euro
pean nations and the United States have a partnership
of interests in the Orient through territorial pos
sessions there, and all have a community of interest in
the Oriental trade. For both reasons they should
desire a ratio that will for a long time closely approx
imate the actual value relation of gold and silver. The
commission has found encouragement in London,
Paris, The Hague and Berlin, and is in St Petersburg
to sound the Czar on the subject. If all those nations
agree with us upon a ratio there will be nothing in
the way of its adoption.
THE United States, with the sympathy of Mex
ico, has a commission abroad to arrange an in
ternational coinage ratio for silver and gold.

Alaskan wildernesses will be brought into connection
with one another. When that is done the task of
uniting the systems of America with those of Asia
by the northern route will hardly be more difficult
than that of connecting the North American , lines
with those of South America across the mighty
mountains that interpose. Neither project is to be
expected speedily, but each is within the scope of the
energy of the century which has opened with such
great expectations and some of the children of this
generation may live to make the grand all rail trip
from Paris to Buenos Ayres in first-class cars and
at a rate of speed that will admit of making the jour
ney as a mere holiday trip.
AMONG the many vast enterprises which now
engage the attention of speculative men none
are more imposing " in their dimensions or
more interesting in their possibilities than the two
great railway projects now before the American
people. One of these projects aims at the construc
tion of a Pan-American railway extending from Can-^
ada to Patagonia, while the other aims at the con
struction of an all rail route from New York to Paris
via Alaska and Siberia.
Neither project seems feasible to the conservative
mind, and yet no intelligent man will, pronounce
either of them to be impossible or even impracticable.
As a matter of fact the only serious obstacle in the
way of either is one of finance rather than of engineer
ing. Capitalists abstain from undertaking them solely
from a well grounded .fear that they will not pay
interest on the investment. If it could be assured
that a railway across the wilds of Alaska and Siberia
would pay dividends right along there would be no
great difficulty in finding men to embark upon the
enterprise. * """
As a matter of fact it appears to be quite probable
that the Pan-American road will come of itself, as it
were, without waiting for any grand combination of
capitalists to finance it. The Canadian railway sys
tetr. is closely connected with; that of the United
States, and our system has close relations with the
Mexican lines. Several of the South American lines
are within reaching distance of the isthmus and a
few connections here and there, made from time to
time, will eventually bring the systems of the two
continents nearer and nearer to a common meeting
point.
Recent reports show that considerable improve
ment is going on along the South American lines
even now. A summary of the work going on in that
continent says:
"The Government of the Argentine Republic has'
pushed the building of its railway lines from Jujuy,
formerly the northern terminus, till they are now
close to the boundary of Bolivia, and Bolivia also is
encouraging the extension of its system south along
the route of the intercontinental survey so as to con
nect with the Argentine system. Chile, which has a
most extensive railway network, is encouraging the
trans-Andean project that will bring Santiago into
through rail connection with Buenos Ayres. Peru
is also having an era of railway building, some actual,
more in prospect. By the. end of the present year it
is likely that the gaps between New York and Buenos
Ayres on the intercontinental route will not aggre
gate more than 4700 miles, as against 5200 miies when
the last reports were made."
The grand project of an all rail route from New
York to Paris appears much more formidable and
impracticable than the Pan-American, and yet it may
prove to be less so. Russia has now in operation a
line across Siberia. Canada is talking ' of a great
northern road to extend her lines to Dawson and the
Klondike country. American energy has built several
lines in Alaska. It is not improbable that at a time
not very far distant those scattered roads in the
BIG RAILWAY PROJECTS.
The two triple-screw Â¦ cruisers Columbia
and Minneapolis are being fitted out fcr
service* at sea after, a rest of nearly five
years,, during which they. have served as
receiving ships at New York and League
Island. They are not, as some naval ex
perts in this country assert, failures, but
they are unquestionably uneconomical as
cruisers." The triple-screw system," while
apparently' abandoned in our navy, has
grown In favor In the navies of France,
Germany and | Russia, and all the recent
battleships and armored cruisers of those
powers are fitted with triple screws. The
defect in our two cruisers is due solely
to the Doilers, : and not to the . principle
of dividing 22.000 horse-power between
three engines. . The slightly - increased
space, weight and 1 personnel required are
fully -compensated for by decreased liabil
ity, of breakdowns and saving in fuel
when using only one engine or.one-thlrd
power under. ordinary cruising speed. In
foreign navies, except that of Great Brit
ain," these r; latter advantages evidently
outweigh all other alleged drawbacks,
and it is to x be : assumed that the 'foreign
naval experts have thoroughly ! studied
the military and "economic i value of the
triple-screw Â¦ system. :1*gjg?jlBfflHHI
The cost of the new Naval Academy at
Annapolis will far exceed the original
estimated cost of $4,000,000. Considerable
progress has been made on the buildings
proper, such as officers' and cadets" quar
ters, but the contracts for accessories
have not yet been awarded. Bids were
opened last month for building the chapel,
the lowest being $365,000. The gymnasium
bids ranged from $222,800 to $230,000, and
the building .of 'a sea wall will require
$141,000. The total cost of the entire In
stitution will be very close to $3,000,000
when finally completed.
The President has Issued an > order In
creasing the pay of enlisted men serv
ing, in gun crews. Heavy gun pointers,
from 13-inch to 7-inch, are to receive from
$10 to 56 a month extra pay. 'Thos.2 of
7-lnch to 4-inch, or intermediate gun
pointers, $8 to $4, and secondary gun
pointers, comprising batteries of 3-inch
down to 1-pounders, are to have $4 to $2
a month extra pay. New ratings of lead
ing men of gun's crews are also estab
lished f with corresponding ; pay. Chief
turret 1 captain, $60 to $70; turret captain,
first class, $50, and enlisted men ; in pri
mary batteries serving a gun captain will
get $5 a month Increased pay. This order
goes. into effect October 1 next."
Two light draught river gunboats are
being built at Elbing Intended for service
in the German possessions In China. One
of these boats, named Tsingkau, ia near
ly ready for shipment. It is of 200 tons
displacement, 164 feet in' length, 26 feet
3 inches beam and draws 2 feet fully
equipped. The armament consists of one
12-pounder, one 1-pounder^ and three ma
chine guns. The motive power is by twin
screws developing about 1400 horse
power, giving a speed of 13% knots, and
the coal supply is sufficient for steaming
2000 miles at 12 knots. The complement
is 53 officers and crew. The several naval
powers have of late years built a num
ber of these serviceable river craft which
acre likely to put a stop to the depreda
tions of the pirates infesting the rivers
and coast of China. .

The French naval budget for 1904 is $62,
586,365, which is a decrease of only J107,
935 on the amount for, the current year.
This slight reduction affects the ship
building programme mainly. Among the
many changes made in the administration
and regulation of naval affairs the most
important one is that reducing the term
of service of crews to two years. It was
adopted by the Senate by a vote of 217
against 23.
The French armored cruiser Sully, 10,
000 tons and 50,000 horsepower, built by
contract at La Seyne, has made its full
power- steam trial and developed 20,110
horsepower and 21.4 knot speed. Its nat
ural draught trial of twenty-four hours
failed. 00 account of the breaking of a
cylinder head. The Desalx's full power
trial had also to be discontinued on ac
count of damage to the port engine. The
Marseillaise fared even worse on her trial,
owing to the carelessness of a workman
who had left some tools' in one of the
cylinders, causing a general smash when
the ship got under steam.
The change in propellers of the armored
cruiser Drake made quite an Improve
ment in the speed. With the first propel
lers, having a" blade area of 152 square
feet, the highest speed was 23.05 knots,
with 30,864 horsepower.. The new pro
pellers have an area of 210 square feet
and gave a speed of 24.11 knots, with 31.4C0
horsepower.
According to the London Times of July
17 the new armored cruiser Donegal of
9800 tons averaged 22.3 knots for thirty
consecutive hours and averaged 23.73
knots in four runs over the measured mile
course. * /
John Thornycroft & Co. of Chiswick,
England, have made another Irecord in
shipbuilding. On April 3 last the Japan
ese Government placed an order with the
firm to build a shallow-draught river gun*
boat as quickly as possible. The vessel
was launched July 14 and made its steam
trial on July 23, making a speed of four
teen knots, or one knot over the contract.
The boat is a duplicate of the British gun
boat Woodcock, built In 1898, and is 145
feet In; length, 24 feet beam and 2 feet
draught fully loaded.
An airship of war is being built in Eng
land, under direction of the War Depart
ment, and is expected to be ready for an
experimental ascent during the month.
The hull proper of this ship Is 180 feet in
length, 75 feet in height and 50 feet wide.
It is composed of an arrangement of
bamboo poles lashed together with ropes
and wires. This framework will riarig be
low the balloon and will carry, in addi
tion to the crew of five men, three fifty
horsepower petrol motors, working a set
of fans on each side of the ship. Each of
these fans has screw blades twelve feet
in length, turning at 1000 revolutions a
minute. The steeripg- is done by a rud
der twelve feet In length. The balloon
has a capacity of 200,000 cubic feet and is
calculated to lift seven tons.
This makes a total of 191 vessels-of-war
of .all types, besides auxiliary crafts, such
as dispatch vessels, colliers, etc. The to
tal complement will be about 4S.0O0, of
which 9000 will be drawn from the Naval
Reserve. .
Thirty-two battleships, including three
old ones for torpedo operations; eight
armored cruisers, including one of an old
type; seven first-class protected cruisers;
twenty- four second-class protected cruis
ers, nine third-class â¢ protected cruisers,
U..rteen torpedo gunboats, sixty-one tor
pedo-boat destroyers, thirty-seven tor
pedo boats.
The armored cruiser 'Berwick has ex
ceeded her calculated speed of twenty
three knots during a continuous run of
eight hours by .613 knots, with 22,000
horsepower. Under one-fifth power the
average horsepower was 4676 and the
speed 14.85 knots for thirty hours, and un
der four-flf ths power the average was 16,000
horsepower and 21.64 knots during thirty
hours. The coal consumption during these
runs was 1.92 and 1.97 pounds for the
thirty hours' trials and 2.10 pounds per
unit of horsepower during the full power
trial. The ship is fitted with Nicclause
water-tube boilers, and their performance
proved quite satisfactory, giving econ
omic results fully up to those. of any other
water- tube bo Jlers and better than the
old Btyle box or Scotch type.
The British naval maneuvers are to be
on a larger scale than ever before, as will
be seen from the following number of
ships that will take part in the opera
tions:
A Washington gambler, who, in order to test the
constitutionality of a law which made gambling a
felony in the State, brought a test case, has been sent
to the penitentiary for a year. This possibly suggests
an exception to that rule which provides that every
man should have the courage of his convictions..
Every city and county election is a matter of im
portance to all citizens, but this one is especially so.
Propositions to issue bonds for large sums of money
for various public improvements have been submit
ted to the popular vote, and it is quite probable that
many, if not all of them, will be carried. That will
mean a large extraordinary expenditure in addition to
the ordinary expenditures of city and county admin
istration. The spoilsmen of politics see before them
ah opportunity for obtaining richer spoils than were
ever before possible in San Francisco, and very nat
urally they will do their uttermost to get control of
the offices for the ensuing term. Their schemes can
be defeated only by the energy of good citizens.
Apathy and indifference to-day may mean a loss of
millions of dollars to the city. It may baffle all the
movements tending to municipal progress and im
provement and bring about a period of stagnation or
worse.
While there are evidences of vigor and of hopeful
ness in the ranks of all parties the general prospects
of the time are more encouraging to Republicans than
to either of the rival organizations. The nomination
of a good ticket by the Republican convention would
virtually assure victory for the party. It therefore
behooves Republicans to make sure of good nomina
tions by electing honest, independent and public
spirited men to the convention. That is the issue
confronting them to-day, and no loyal member of the
party should permit any private business or pleasure
to interfere with his performance of his political duty.
The choice submitted to Republican voters in the
different districts is not a difficult one. The United
Republican League, which was organized to unify the
Republicans of the city and to eliminate factional dif
ferences and boss control, has done its work well by
proposing in every district a list of candidates who if
elected will worthily represent in the nominating con
vention the best traditions of the party and the best
hopes of the city. It is to be borne in mind that the
gentlemen proposed by the United League are
pledged to no faction and are subservient to no boss.
They will have no other aim in convention than that
of nominating a ticket which will merit the support
not only of all loyal Republicans but of all inde
pendents who sincerely desire the welfare of the city.
The opposition tickets are either directly controlled
by ward bosses or are indirectly playing into their
hands. For Republicans then the issue is simply that
of voting for genuine Republicanism as represented
by the United Republican League or voting for
bossism.
The appeal of the league to Republican voters says:
"Do your duty as a citizen and interest yourself in
the selection of delegates to a convention which will
name a ticket to command the respect and confidence
of the community, which will stand for a new and'
better San Francisco, which will give us an admin
istration based on business principles, which will im
prove our streets, 1 our schools, our hospitals and our
other public institutions instead of wasting our taxes
on extravagant and unnecessary salaries, and above
all will be the advance guard of the battle for con
tinued prosperity to be fought under the leadership
of Roosevelt in 1004."
To that appeal The Call has only to add an appeal
to voters of each party having candidates in the field:
Go to the primaries, vote against the bosses, elect
honest delegates to your party convention. Let us
have clean politics and good men to the front all
along the line in the campaign that awaits us.
UPON the voters of San Francisco there rest|
to-day the important duty of attending the
primaries and doing their uttermost to pro
cure the election to their party conventions of dele
gates who can be relied upon to nominate fit men
for every office to be filled at the approaching elec
tion. The duty affects equally men of all parties. It
is a duty inherent in the citizenship of a free country,
and the man who ignores it or evades it fails in one
of the essential characteristics of genuine American-

THE CIVIL WAB IN
PICTORIAL PANORAMA
IN all the gamut of human emotions there b nothing that stirs the
inmost soul of man like the clash of war. Civilization may cul-
tivate lamblike virtues, but it does not eradicate the instinct for the
heroic and the ferocious. In music it is the crashing martial strain that
makes the strongest appeal to the greatest number. In mythology the
greatest warriors are given most reverence. In history the battle cry
ever sounds the loudest, most sensuous note; while in art it is the wild
scenes of blood and carnas:e-^of daredevil attack and desperate defenseâ
in the awful shock of contending forces that rouses all the passions to
fever heat. And thus it is that around the spirit that will do and die for
a principle the tenderest sentiments ever cling. And thus it is. too.
that the coming Encampment of thÂ« Grand Army of the Republic in
our city stands as the symbol of all America's present grandeur.
To those whose names make up its roll of honor that stupendous
struggle must ever be a vivid reality, but to those of the younger gen-
eration the hope and despair of that fierce conflict must be seen through
the eyes of the artist and the painter. And it is a remarkable fact that
some of the best battle scenes ever painted are those depicting our great
Civil War from beginning to end. â¢
* ; It is this fact that has enabled The Sunday. Call in its special
G. A. R. Edition next Sunday to present its readers with the best pic-
torial panorama of fiercest . battles of the war that can be offered by a
modern newspaper^ Beginning with General Grant's victory at Fort
Donelson, these pictures carry you through the entire war to its, spec-
tacular close with the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox. which
scene alone, replete as it is with historical characters, is one of the most
notable pictures ever reproduced on a modern color press. There is
"The Battle of Shiloh." "Chattanooga." "The Siege of Vicksburg."
"Sherman's March to the Sea." "The Battle of Gettysburg," "Grant's Ca-
reer From West Point to Appomattox," etc
And in the line of fiction the greatest popularity has ever been given
to tales of love and. war. Just think what themes the Civil War had to
offer! And what sentiment, 'too! There is "Forty Years After" in the
next Sunday Call, for instance. It is a story of the wavering tide of
battle at Vicksburg. *with a thrill ingly pathetic denouement in this citv.
Then there is "A Girl of the South," "Fate's Pence." "A War Vision"
and "Trying Him Out." which latter will bring back the most stirring
memories to any one who knows anything about war.
And in a different way, how many know anything about the
speeches that created that awful slaughter. There are two pages of fervid
eloquence that will simply amaze you who* read them now,- so many
years after.
. And even more strangely appealing are the two pages of. anecdotes
from the hospital, the bivouac and the battlefield told by women who
consecrated their lives to ''nursing. It is warâ actual warâ from the
point of view of over fiftv of these ministering angels.
And last but not least, there is that magnificent Supplement â t-nder
sentiment crystallized into colorâ "The Old Army Chest." wherein a
hardy Vairtor of the rebellion is showing his treasures to his beautiful
fair-haired daughter. Just register a deep- voiced complaint with your
earner if you do not get this picture with your G. A. R. Edition of the
next Sunday Call. .Robert T. Baker, drayman, 857 Bryant
street, secured a warrant from Police
Judge Cabaniss yesterday for the arrest

witness admit that they might have been

whether . there would â¢ not : be considerable
difference", in a man's signature on the
morning after ho had attended a late ban
quet' and-' on the Â¦Â¦ morning after- having
gone to bed sober and early on the even
ing of the preceding day. The expert re
plied, to make a stronger illustration of
his idea, thatif axnarffrmade^his signa
ture while seasick " orj riding " on horse

the individual peculiarities of, his writing

added that * business ; men * never change
their handwriting, unless designedly, and
for the purpose of disguising it.'
THE MARTIN CASE.
Mr. Shortridca than put a hypothetical
Drawing Teacher Wanted.
An Interesting lecture on the subject of
handwriting, as exhibiting the individual
ity of the writer and the modes by which
a forged signature may be distinguished
from a genuine one, was delivered yester
day forenoon\in the United States Dis
trict Court, with Carl Eisenschimmel as
lecturer, Samuel M. Shortridge as teaser,
United States District Attorney Marshall
B. Woodworth as backer, United States
District Judge de Haven as peacemaker,
a jur.y of twelve as referee and William
H. Dillard In the blackground as the
prisoner at the bar, accused of forging
the signature of Internal Revenue Col
lector John C. Lynch to fraudulent Chi
nese certificates of registration.
Expert Eisenschimmel had testified on
the preceding day of the trial, that the
signatures of Collector Lynch on four
teen of the fraudulent certificates were
forged. Mr. Shortridge, on cross-exami
nation, attempted to break the force of
the testimony by impugning Eisenschim
mel's motives, as well as attacking his
competency. The expert, however, was
cautious in his replies as well as posi
tive, and took pains to impress the jury
with the fact Xhat x he had made up his
mind after careful examination before
giving his testimony, and that on the sub
ject of which .he had spoken he was as
Infallible as the Delphian Oracle." Not
withstanding that the witness appeared to
be of a nervous, excitable temperament,
he avoided the trap set for him by the
<*>unsel and kept well on his feet during
the whole time of the seance. Mr. Short
ridge asked him whether he did not tes
tify always in favor of the side that em
ployed him, and the reply was given that
such was not the fact, that he had often
given an opinion adverse to the hopes of
the persons who Had called him in and
thereby lost the opportunity of employ
ment at a good fee.
CHANGE OP OPINION.
"Have you not sometimes' on further
examination changed your opinion as to
the genuineness of ' a signature?", ques
tioned the lawyer. â¢ .
"Never, sir," was the emphatic answer
of. the expert, "because ray opinion Is
based up<Jn careful \ investigation aria
therefore cannot be changed."

general ordinances prohibited. Lane re
fers to a former opinion of his on the
subject, which says:
. There la no power In the Board of Super
visors to make laws denying a. privilege to the
people at large and granting to one or more
Individuals the right to disobey the general
law. It is within the power of thÂ« board to
amend the tire ordinance so as to permit
broader privileges than those therein granted,
but such amendment must be made applicable
to all and subject to the same conditions.
Instead of proceeding upon the assumption
that the Board of Supervisors Intends to go be
yond lta legal authority, let me suggest that
you confer with said boardta* to the enacting
of such legislation as wouiu obviate any con
flict and clash of authority.
The following ordinances were finally
passed:
Imposing a license of $100 per day on ev*ry
owner or lessee of a circus.
- An- adjournment was taken until this
morning at ; 10 o'clock, when' Kytka will
ba further cross-examined.
Shortridge: expressed gratification that
the question was asked the witness, as
it gave him an unlooked for opportunity
; to* show, a few facts. He proved ; by Kyt
ka's own ' lips . that the expert would have
acted .as exoert for the defendant had
Shortridge been able to pay -him a retain
ing fee of $50. Kytka said he was ready
and willing to accept the employment, but
had received an i offer '. from the Govern
ment and 1 had accepted. Â¦ -, ".
Â¦ Kytka r testified it took him two days
to discover that the signatures were for
geries. 'Â¦ : Â¦â¢* v: :'â¢ t&sSSSQBSB&B&BfBBtM
This unexpected reply surprised Short
ridge and caused the Jury to smile. Eis
enschimmel was allowed^ to depart, and
Theodore Kytka, another handwriting ex
pert, was called by the United States Dis
trict Attorney.
â¢ Attorney Woodworth asked Kytka
about various exhibits handed him, and
the witness said he had examined them
and v/as of the opinion they were for
geries. Counsel for th# Government turn
ed Kytka over to Shortridge and the lat
ter asked three or four preliminary ques
tions, when Woodworth interrupted and
asked leave to put a question to the ex
pert.' * v = Â» Â¦â¢".'..
'."Didn'P Mr. Shortridge try to employ
you in this case?" asked Woodworth.,.
"Yes, , sir," replied Kytka.
OFFER FBOM BOTH SIDES.
"Do you know David Carvalho and Pro-'
fessor Ames, the eminent handwriting ex
perts?" asked Shortridge.
"\es, sir," replied Eisenschimmel.
"Did they testify against you in the
Davidson will case?"
The court interfered again, and Short
rldRe took an exception. In order to have
his exceptions noted in the record Short
ridge asked:
"Do you know Professor Max Gum
pel?"
"Very sliphtly," was the reply.
"Is he an expert?"
"No, sir: he's a fraud.".
JUDGE DE HAVEN rOBJEGTS.
Judge de Haven refused to allow the
expert to reply. He said it was an im
proper question, and Shortridge took an
exception to the voluntary ruling.
The attorney for the negro defendant
attempted to belittle Eisenschimmel's tes
timony by asking him about cases in
which he had appeared as an expert and
the, result had been against his testi
mony. The court sustained all objections,
but Shortridge succeeded in getting,
enough before the jury to weaken Elsen-'
schlmmel's testimony.
Eisenschimmel reiterated that John C.
Lynch's original signature was full of
life and animation, whereas the "C" in
the two forgeries showed that they were
slowly manufactured and full of artifi
ciality. The expert stood before the black
board and lectured like a college profes
sor. Ho was vehement in his statement
that Lynch's signature had been forged
and attempted to prove, it by illustra
tions. The jury was greatly amused at
Eisenschlmmers earnestness. The expert
grew irritable when interrupted In hl3
analysis and Shortrldge had to appeal to
the court for the right to take a hand.
Eisenschimmel was in his element before
the, blackboard and he made the most of
his' opportunity.
"Children in -/.school," returned Mr. Eis
enschimmel, "Â».re not taught to write.
They are taugfit to draw letters. After
they reallv le.*rn to write the physical
characteristics { of their handwriting do
not chanKe. Take twelve boys in the
same class, taught- by the same teacher,
and you will llnd that the handwriting
of each of thein varies from the rest. It
will be found that the style of each one
of them has Its individuality." .
At this stage; of the trial a recess was
taken until 2 t>. m.
In the afternoon Eisenschimmel was ex
amined very minutely as to his ability
to te.ll a genuine signature from a forged
one. The witness claimed the right to
avail himself of his memoranda before
answering the interrogations put to him
by Shortridge.
"You have had considerable experience
in cases where handwriting was in dis
pute?" asked Shortridge.
"Yes, sir," replied the witness.
â¢'You were a witness in the George N.
Martin case?"
"Yes, sir. That was the case where
Martin disguised his signature to a rail
road pass and was thrown off the train
at a lonely station and suffered locomotor
ataxia. He sued for $75,000."
"And did not the jury give him a ver
dict of $25,000 against your testimony?"
question. "Suppose," he : asked, "that a
child eight years of age were taught to
write bv a certain teacher in a certain
style, and that after he had reached the
age of 12 years his father placed him
under another teacher and had him
taught to write in a different style, would
not his later . handwriting be different
from the first T;'
The Health Board submitted a progres
sive report of the work done in China
town, showing that forty-nine structures
were, condemned and destroyed, 105
plumbing nuisances were actually abated
and thirty-five buildings were vacated un
til renovated and repaired.
The Supervisors' Public Utilities Com
mittee yesterday referred to the Board of
Public Works the communication from
the Bay Cities "Water Company. The let
ter calls attention to the company's ex
tensjfve water sheds and adequate and de
sirable reservoir sites and water supply
centralizing in Santa Clara County within
sixty miles of San Francisco and invit
ing an examination of its water facilities.
The board named Is requested to in
vestigate and report upon the availability
of the source mentioned for the purpose
of furnishing this .city with a sufficient
supply of pure drinking water.
The Barber Asphalt Company was
granted an extension of ninety days from
August 18, 1903, within which to complete
its contract for widening and repaying
Third street, between Mission and Berry.
The extension is granted because there
have been numerous delays in the prose
cution of the work due to the reconstruc
tion of the railroad tracks and the reset
ting, of poles, - conduits and gas mains,
matters over which the contractor has no
control. The Pacific States Telephone
Company and other corporations were di
rected to remove . and reset such poles,
mains or conduits as interfere with the
work of repaying Third street.
The Bdard of Works was directed to
set aside out of its "county road fund"
the sum of $500 for the repaying of that
half of Buena Vista avenue abutting
Buena Vista Park provided the property
owners of the other half contribute an
equal amount. > ' .

ficient Water Supply for
TBTJSTEES OF SAUSALITO
HOLD IMPORTANT MEETING
SAUSALITO, Aug. 10.â At a meeting of
the Town Trustees held this evening the
much discussed question of securing a
sufficient supply of water came up for
consideration. The committee of citizens
appointed to confer with the different wa
ter companies in the county reported that
at least two of the companies were will
ing to supply all the water required If the
town would build a necessary storage
reservoir and lay water mains. The
building of a reservoir and the laying of
mains would necessitate the bonding of
the town. ,
After a lengthy but Interesting discus
sion a resolution favoring the bonding of
Sausallto to secure the needed water sup
ply was passed by a majority vote of the
Trustees.

SARATOGA. Aug. 10.â What promised
to be an excellent day's sport when the
entries closed on Saturday afternoon was
spoiled by the heavy rainfall of Sunday
and the fields were v*yy smalL
By far the most interesting event of the
day was the steeplechase, in which
"Jimmy" Mara again proved that he is
worth his weight in gold as a rider of
steeplechase horses. He had the mount
on J. W. Colt's Amur, only recently sold
by John A. Drake to the present owner,
and on which Drake wagered heavily. The
top weig-ht, Foxhunter, one of the hand
somest henses in training, made the run
ning, in company with J. E. Widener's
Caller. The latter retired after two-thirds
of the race had been run, and then Amur
went on, in company with Foxhunter.
The two fought it out desperately to the
very last Jump. They appeared to be
dead tired. By main strength Mara kept
Amur's head in front of Foxhunter. and
the two passed the finishing point almost
locked together. Ten or a dozen lengths
behind came Caller, which was stopping at
every stride, but managed to last long
enough to defeat Manilian a bead. Sum

HARBIN SPRINGS, Aug. 10.âMoun
tain fires in this vicinity made the heat
almost unbearable, notwithstanding
which Jim Jeffries worked hard in the
gymnasium for more than an hour this
afternoon. He pounded away at the
punching bag until dripping with perspir
ation and then indulged in three severe
rounds j of tugging and wrestling with
Joe Kennedy and Jack Jeffries. While
both of his trainers were well winded at
the close Jeff showed slight signs of
fatigue. To-morrow and Tuesday he will
again * indulge in gymnasium exercises,
but boxing with his sparring partners
will be eliminated. Wednesday morning
the champion and his camp followers will
depart for Oakland. Thursday afternoon
Jeff will strip at the Reliance Club, but
will not put on the gloves.
In his corner Friday night the cham
pion will be looked after by Bob Fitz
-simmons, Manager Billy Delaney, Joe
Kennedy and Jack Jeffries. A club man
from San Francisco, who Is a visitor here
at the springs, said to-day that the re
ports of Jeffries partaking of an occa
sional bottle of wine and otherwise
slighting his training had caused plenty
of short end money. to come to the sur
face. Inferentially the club man said he
would bet 1100 against $200 on Corbett.
Almost immediately Jim Hayes, proprie
tor of the springs and unquestionably
the most enthusiastic admirer the cham
pion has, offered to bet $1003 agafnst $500
that Jeff would win and the discussion
ceased. Hayes thinks the contest will
not go ten rounds, so impressed has he
become wfth the champinon's fast work
and terrific punching power.
F. E. MULHOLLAND.
As the hour of the battle draws nearer
Corbett is easing up in his physical
labors at his camp in Alameda. Yes
terday he boxed twelve rounds in the
open air with Yank Kenny and Sam Ber
ger, taking each man one alternately.
After pulling oft the gloves. Corbett went
into his gymnasium and took a turn at
the various muscle developing machines
and wrestled with the large leather bag
filled with wheat, which is much heavier
than Jeffries and bulkier. In the after
noon the big boxer took part in the usual
baseball game.- Corbett expects to con
tinue work until Thursday morning, but
If the mood strikes him he Is apt to in
dulge in light exercise Friday morning.
"Jim thinks that he will weigh about
1S5 pounds when he clambers through
the ropes Friday night." said Professor
Dare, "but it is my opinion that he will
be closer to 1SS. He is now in fine form
and as his general disposition 13 Jovial
he will pick up a few pounds with but
little to do before Friday night."
Professor Tommy Dare, to whose abil
ity as a conditioner more than to any
other person James J. Corbett owes his
present splendid physical condition, ven
tures ! the statement that the ex-cham
pion will enter the ring Friday, night to
do battle with Champion James J. Jeffries
weighing:' close to 188 pounds. He flgurea
that with the discontinuance of vigorous
training work Corbett will take on several
extra pounds between now and gong
time. Yesterday Jim tipped the beam
at 1S6 pounds, and that after he had
taken a fourteen mile run on the day pre
vious and sweated off Jthree pounds.

Rheumatism
Is Not a Skin Disease*
Most people have an idea that rheumatism is contracted like'a cold, that the
damp, chilly air penetrates the muscles and joints and causes the terrible aches
and pains, or that it is something like a Bkin disease to be rubbed away -with lini-
ment or drawn out with plasters; but Rhuematism originates in the blood and is
caused by Urea, or Uric. Acid, an irritating, corroding poison that settles in mus-
cles, joints and nerves, producing inflammation and soreness and the sharp, cutting
pains peculiar to this distressing disease.

Special Dispatch to The CalL
CHICAGO. Aug. 10.â Clinging in her
dying hours to the name which she had
chosen to save an honorable Southern
family from the disgrace of the life Into
which she had been led, Mary Lytle. who
shot herself on Saturday evening In the
Auditorium, gave an ante-mortem state
ment to the police this afternoon,' signing
to it her adopted name of "Marie Gordon,
Montgomery. Ala," The statement Itself
is a mere catalogue of the events of her
stay in Chicago since her arrival on July
29, which the police and public already
knew something about, but In occasional
explanatory remarks made to detectives
who were standing about her bedside she
revealed the tragedy which blighted her
life and brought sorrow and disgrace
upon the Lytle family of Tennessee, Into
which the late ex-President Benjamin
Harrison married.
A trip through the red light district
with her brother, W. R. Lytle,' his shoot
ing of a porter and her own attempt at
Miiclde form the last chapter of her sad
life.
In her younger days Mary Lytle was a
belle of Murfreesboro. Tenn. Among her
admirers was a young man now said to
be prominently connected with a South
ern railroad. Whether through his Influ
ence or not she did not say, but at all
events she became involved with a fast
set and finally became a social outcast,
moving at last to Montgomery, Ala.
Despite her downfall, she etill retained
her affection for and admiration of the
man for the love of whom she sought
death in her room at the Auditorium on
Saturday evening. Their attachment was
the talk of their circle of acquaintances
In Montgomery. Then he deserted her
and she left Montgomery in the .' latter
part of July with the avowed intention of

During hia journey President Wheeler
met former President Cleveland at his
home in Princeton. From Mr. Cleveland
he gathered that the former President
would not be a candidate for re-election,
though he expressed satisfaction that
the Democracy was returning to its old
time conservatism and was likely to again
become, a power in politics.
Regarding the changes that would oc
cur In the faculty of the University of
California this year. President Wheeler
said there would not be as many new
men as last year. For the vacancy in
the civil engineering department he said
he had secured Professor Charles Der
leth of the University of Colorado. The
two vacancies in the history department,
due to the resignations of Professor K.
C. Babcock, who has accepted the presi
dency 'of the University of Arizona, and
Professor G. T. Lapsley. will remain un
filled for the present. Professor Lapsley's
place will remain vacant until after the
present term, but Professor Babcock's
place will be filled In September.

Yale and Princeton and most of the lancer
universities and State universities are satisfied
with the four-year course. They are all willing
and anxious, however, that Harvard should
try the three-year course. It Is recoirnJred
that there is too much of nameness In the
character of the American colleges. Wo have
(tone too far In leveling out the Individuality
cf our institutions. We ought to find some uni
formity of standard, so that students may hÂ»
abl* to movi^from one Institution to another
without beinic hampered by a great many petty
restrictions In the way of requirements to bo
met. When a student comes to us we ask
"what has he studied?" but it seems to me it
would be far more rational to aek If the etu
dent is able to go on with the work he wants
to do.
President Eliot's theories were not convinc
ing enough for the convention anil the general
feeling of the representatives of the State uni
versities was that the four-year course should
prevail.
ment that the lengthening of the high school
course to four years really shortens the bacca
laureate term by one year. His ideal of cul
tural studies is, however, not the literary stud
ies to much as the scientific studies, and hU
culture is not bo much in the humanities as in
the control that comeS from scientific culture.

It is the intention of the committee to
have a special boat run from' San. Fran
cisco direct to the foot of" Broadway,'
where the veterans and their families
will be met by the members of the recep
tion committee and escorted to the "Wil
lows," on the shore of Lake Merritt,
where an open air lunch will be served.
If the necessary funds are subscribed
to cover the expense of the entertain
ment, the ladles of the various auxilliax
ies of the Grand Army posts in Alameda
County will be requested to assist in
serving the refreshments, but owing to
the uncertainty of the committee as to
the programme, no official action 'has as
yet been taken In the matter.
Arrangements will be made with the
Oakland Transit Company whereby every
veteran will be presented with a ticket
entitling himself and the members of his
family to transportation to any of the
following Berkeley, Alameda,
Haywards,* San Leandro or Fruitvale,
over any of the lines of the company.
The committee does not intend to have
any parade as it would only result in an
unnecessary amount of fatigue to the old
soldiers, but it may be decided later to
have a line of march- from the foot of
Broadway to the lake shore.
In appointing the citizens' reception
committee Mayor Olney endeavored to
avoid, as far as possible, the appoint

the reason that he as a member felt that
the members of every Grand Army post
In Alameda County should consider them

President Eliot of Harvard was strongly op
posed to this plan. He ttands for a baccalau
reate course of three years/ making the argu-
The most Interesting session was that in
which the baccalaureate degree was discussed.
This Is a question upon which the "University
of California . has already taken a
decided stand. I was glad to â¢ note
that thts general, trend of opinion
was directly In line with the solution of the
question as practiced here â that is, toward the
maintenance of the four-year course, with the
distinct demarcation at the ejid of the two
college years. By making this sharp division
of the college course the two first years are
devoted to general culture and the two last
years to specialization, these last being also
the basis for a professional career. This plan.
I believe, corresponds more truly to the actual
demands of the facts In American education
and offers the genuine American solution. .
"That Embassadorship story must have
been suggested by my visit to the White
House," he said. "There never was any
thing of the kind thought of either by the
President or myself."
"How about President Eliot of Har-_
vard? They say he is going to retire and
you will probably take his place?"
"Well, that's the first I've heard of it,"
replied President Wheeler. "The last
time I saw President Eliot he was in ro
bust health and 1 am sure there's no pros
pect of his retirement for a long time."
President Wheeler then seemed to think
he ought to make one sweeping, unequiv
ocal statement as to his position and.
after pausing to gather himself together,
he proceeded to unburden himself of thu
words quoted above.
The primary purpose of President
Wheeler's Eastern trip was to preside
as chairman of the sessions of the Na
tional Educational Association at Boston.
This is an immense institution, including
as It does representatives of every edu
cational Institution in the country,' the
membership being about 40,000 people. Its
progress was watched by educators ev
erywhere, as Its conclusions have an im
portant part in shaping the conduct of
all educational institutions. Speaking of
the gathering. President Wheeler said:
EMBASSADORSHIP STORY.
In (his brief but unmistakable state
ment President. Benjamin . iA} Wheeler,
just after his return this morninsr from
a two months' absence. in. the East, set at
rest, for once and: all the' rumors that he
â¢contemplated, retiring * from \ the univer
sity to accf'pj'* a diplomatic or some other
university position: .V Â¦ ~.
Rumor' always takes liberties with
Presfdent^wheeler when he Is in the East
and. during . each of his., three annual
absences from the Pacific Coast his name
has been coupled with all sorts of absurd
possibilities, ' Ills' visit to President
.Roosevelt, with.. whom he. spent a night
at 'the White HouVe this summer, started
the rumor that hf had been offered the
post of Embassuojr to Frame, though
there was no Â¦ vacancy there, or likely to
be. A little later hi* visit to Harvard
University set a rumor a-going that
President Charles W. Eliot contemplated
retiring and that President "Wheeler was
being sought after by the trustees of the
university for the vacancy anticipated.
Thess absurd stories followed President
"Wheeler all through his. travels this sum
mer and he smiled when the representa
tives of the press, to whom he gave audi
ence this morning, asked him to deny or
affirm them.
â¢|â^. ERKELEY, Aug. 10.â "Just say I
1Â»=4? nm devoting my life to educa-
LJ/.tlon in California; and I never
will think of any other career."
Just before the shooting Folsom-street
car number 1005 passed on its way to the
ferry. Motorman W. H. Bookman and
Conductor I. Watsoti consulted for a mo
ment, then ran the .car to the scene of the
shooting and" took Sample to the Harbor
Hospital. Their presence '.of ,'mlnd en
abled the wo'unded man to reach the hos
pital and -make' a dying statement.- It
is believed he'- will --die #arly to-day r ,. ;Â¦.â¢;.
Sample's dying statement was taken by
Assistant District Attorney Flood. He
pai<l .the two men were lighting a third,
who was a boilf>r-maker> When he tried
to break up the fight h*Â» was atacked and
shot down. Dr. Miller said Sample could
not live.
The suspects werfi taken to the Harbor
station, where Sample lay.in great pain,
a bullet wound in his brain, his face
powder burned. He identified Sullivan as
the man who fired the first shot, possibly
the second, though of this he was not
certain.
The prisoners are men of scare 21 year*
of age.
\ The combatants at once attacked him
and Sample fought back with his club.
During the struggle two shots were fired
and Sample fell to the sidewalk. The dis
turbance made a great noise and Patrol
men N'obman and t Clark, and Special
Bcatty arrested ' Powell and Sullivan as
they ran from the scene. !
Robert Sample, a special policeman who
lives at 4330 Twenty-third street, was
fatally shot at a late !rour last night, and
John Henry Powell and Charles Sullivan
were arrested for the crime. Sullivan was
once arrested for robbery, anu he bears a
hard name. . 'â¢Â» .Â¦â¢'Â¦*Â¦.' Â¦.
The shooting occurred ; â¢- on Folsom
street, between First arid Second. There
had been a political meettngJn the vicin
ity, and after the crowd had dispersed
Powell and Sullivan got into a' fight.
Martin Kelly, It is, said, told Robert
Sample that the men were fighting,
whereupon Sample attempted to separate
them. .,'Â¦-.
Capitalist Charles R. Lloyd never for
gave his son Frederick for the â¢ stand
t: . latter took In connection with thÂ«
shooting of Lloyd by his nephew,
William Boxall, at San Bernardino last
January, and In his 'will, which was filed
to-day with the County Clerk, the senior
Lloyd expressly states that he makes no
provision for his son Frederick. The will
was dated June 19. 1903. and was mada
Just prior to the senior Lloyd's sailing for
t! ? Orient. He was under $100,000 bonds
to appear at the trial of his nephew on a
charge of assault to commit murder.
Representatives of Lloyd's estate say
he was worth close to Jl.000,000. The will
was filed to-day by Attorney Arthur W.
Goodfellow, who, with Thomas Addlson.
Is named as executor. The entire prop
erty is left In trust to them for ten years.
One-third of the Income Is to go to the
widow of the deceased and the other two
thirds Is to be divided among: three of his
children. Charles R., Mabel F. and Ethel
Mary. At the end of ten years me prop
erty is to be divided in the 3amÂ« propor
tion. In alluding to his son he says:
"For my son, Frederick XV. Lloyd. I ex
pressly make no provision." There Is no
allusion as to the reason why Frederick
is said to have sided with the Boxall
forces in the troubles of the capitalist
last winter.
Certain small legacies are left by Lloyd
as follows: To Matilda Buttner of Sunot.
$500; to Lcie H. Wilkinson of Los Angeles.
$500; to Elizabeth M. Nix. wife of Samuel
Nix of Oakland. $3000, and her mother,

SAN RAFAEL, Aug. lO.-Owing to an
Increase in its assessment of more than
$100,000, the Marin County Water Com
pany, Is at outs with the city of San Ra
fael. The company will make strenuous
efforts to have its taxes placed at the
same figure as last year, while the mem
bers of the City Council who are opposed
to the corporation will put forth every
endeavor to have the assessment In
creased over former years. ' .
William Vanderbilt, City^Assessor, in
making up the assessment roll for the
present year, appraised the water com
pany's property at J11S.0OO more than It
was appraised last year.
The Board of Equalization met in the City
Hall to-day to examine the assessment
roll and to listen to San Rafael taxpayers
who had grievances. Several large prop
erty-owners asked for a reduction of their
assessment,' but the water company made
the "strongest plea for a cut. Attorney K.
B. Martlnelli appeared in behalf of the
corporation. In asking for a decrease Mr.
Martlnelli stated tljat the company had
not improved its property to warrant any
such increase in the valuation, and as
the Council would not permit the cor
poration to raise the water rates. Its in
come was, he said, necessarily decreased.
For that reason, he argued, that the prop
erty should be assessed' at the same flg
ure as last year.
The matter was taken under advise
ment.

VANCOUVER.. B. C. Aug. 10.â A storm
swept down the Gulf of Georgia early
this morning while 3000 fishing boats were
out and it is estimated .that a Rcore of
Japanese were drowned. Thlrty-flve boats
failed to report at the canneries this
morning and each of these boats con
tained two men. Later in the day it was
found that eight or ten of the boats had
sought shelter in the small bays among
the islands, but It Is probable that at
least ten of the fishing craft were either
overturned or else = battered against the
rocks and their occupants drowned. The
identity of many of the lost men may
never be discovered. â¢

This decision gives any party to litiga
tion a right to enforce the taking of
depositions of the' opposite party before
a notary.
That part of the decision in the Leztnsky
case which holds that the power to punish
for such contempts Is not given to the courts
In which the' action Is pending by the provis
ions of sections 1B8S-1891. Code of Civil Pro
cedure. Is Inconsistent with this conclusion.
Thore sections do not attempt to give such
power In the case of depositions, except to the
officer taking the deposition, but in so far
as that case holds that the court in which
the action is pending baa no power, under
section 1209. to punish as a contempt of its
authority a refusal to obey the subpena of a
notary engaged In' the regular proceeding of
the taking of a deposition In the action com
manding the attendance of a witness for the
purpose of. giving his deposition, we are of
the opinion that it is founded on too restricted
views of the nature and origin of our courts
of general Jurisdiction, and of their powers
as set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure, and
that it should be overruled.
It follows from the reasons we have stated
that the court below had jurisdiction of the
proceeding for contempt, and the writ of re
view should be denifd and the proceeding of
the court below affirmed, and It Is so ordered.
SUSTAINS LOWER COURT.
Thin question was decided in the negative in
the Lerinsky vs. Lezlnsky case. There can
be no doubt that the decision has been the
caute of great and numerous obstructions to
the proceeding of our trial courts In the ad
ministration of Justice. That it has not met
with the approval of the profession Is mani
fested by the frequent attempts that have
come to the notice of this court to compel
obedience by resort to Â¦ other methods. The
effect of nuch a rule Is that the power of a
court to compel a witness to testify Is limited
to those cases where he is required to be per
sonally present at trial. In the matter of giv
ing his deposition a witness may exercise his
own pleasure and may obey or disobey the
subpena of the examining officer as his con
eclenoe or inclination may dictate.
The conduct of the petitioner in refusing to
answer the mbpena. Issued by th^ notary and
willfully refusing to attend at the time and
place fixed for the taking of the deposition
was an Interference with that proceeding.
The Supreme Court yesterday rendered
a decision reversing the decision in the
Lczinsky case. The opinion was written
by Justice Shaw and was concurred in by
Justices Henshaw, Beatty and Van Dyke.
In the case of the Union Collection
Agency vs. the Fire Dispatch Company it
was sought to take the deposition of one
E. O. Burns before Notary Public A. J.
Henry. Burns ignored the subpena, and
an order of the Superior Court was made
directing Burns â¢ to show cause why he
should not be punished for contempt of
court for refusing to appear and give
his deposition. The court thereupon ad
judged Burns guilty of contempt of court
and the matter was taken up to the Su
preme Court on certiorari to review the
order of the Superior Court in adjudging
the petitioner guilty of contempt The
higher court said:
The Question is whether the Superior Court
in which an action is pending has the au
thority to punith for contempt a witness who
refuses to obey the subpena of a notary. Is
sued in pursuance of regular proceedings un
der the code for the taking of his deposition
to be used In the pending case.
ANNOYING DECISION.

Port Townsend says that preparations are
under way at Forts Flagler, Worden and
Casey, commanding the Straits of Fuca,
tOv prevent the Pacific squadron, under
command of Rear Admiral Casey, from
entering Puget Sound waters unknown to
the forts named. Under instructions from
Washington, Colonel Grimes, command
ant at'Fortw'lagler. is on the lookout for
the cruiser New York and other vessels
in Admiral Casey's -eet. The mimic war
fare'in contemplation has for its object
the determination of the alertness of the
officers and men at the forts command
ing the entrance to Puget Sound. The
test will be quite as difficult as those re
cently made on the Atlantic coast, and
especially since dense fogs prevail almost
daily on the lower Sound at this season.
The Pacific squadron left Bremerton
several weeks asro for a practice cruise
in the Notth Pacific Ocean and inciden
tally to select the most available site on
the Aleutian archipelago for coaling sta
tions to be visited by warships coming
and goinc from the Orient. The entire
absence of telegraphic communication
precludes all possibility of intimation
either as to the movement of the fleet
there 'or the possible date of its return.
These ideal conditions are thus being
made use of by the Washington authori
ties to determine whether a hostile fleet
could run the sauntlet of the triangle
of defensive works off Port Townsend and
capture the Bromerton navy yard.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
Livernash replied that Moore's chair un
occupied was as pleasing a sight to him
as when the lawyer was present.
The hearing will be resumed this morn
ing and should be closed by, the end of
this week.
During the afternoon Livernash began
filing statements of several hundred car
men who complained of the raise in their
rent. This action on the part of the
carmen's counsel brought out' a. strong
protest on the part of Attorney Moore.
He said these statements should have
been tiled when Livernash. was handling
his case in general. The filing of the
statements took up too much time and
overfilled the records, he said. . He wound
up by sating that he did not intend to sit
at the desk and . listen while Livernash
read from the big mass of documents in
front of him. . .
MOORE BECOMES WEARY.
The strurmre of this Government rests upon
the broad base of popular rights and culture.
T.'io ancient Siatfs, for the most part, did not
contemplate the elevation of the people, antl a
competency %nd culture were the privileges sf
the few. The Egyptian and Roman monuments
â¢Â¦â¢/ere largely constructed by slave labor. Their
civilization was top-heavy and superficial and
hence not deeply rooted. The American Idea
Is to diffuse these benefits and not concentrate
them. The Government rests upon the lntelll-
K?nce and morality of the people, because man
hood suffrage la the aource . of all political
power. â¢ . â¢ Â¦Â¦
I therefore consider the effort Inaugurated
by lab*:r to procure more leisure and the
means to meet a higher standard of living, al
though it be selfishly made, results In advanc
ing; and preserving American civilization. This
demand cannot go any further than the ability
of the country In Its resources and business en
lerprl.-es to meet it. without discouraging anu
embarrassing production and manufactures. So
long as it servce the purpose of effecting a
more generous distribution of wealth, leaving
ample ar-.d legitimate, though not excessive,
pronto to th<* employer, then and In that event
it preserves and promotes the i>ermanent lntÂ«^r
cbts of the cmintry.
POPULAB RIGHTS.
The greater the number who. may pessess,
c\en In a small degree, the leisure and the
meanc of enjoying cultivated life, or of Im
proving themselves, the greater is the commu
nity's contribution to -civilization; and, I be
lieve that every manÂ«who haa the industry to
work, should claim leisure as a right to Im
prove hlmrelt outside of the employment In
wrlch he is enrased. and that It is the Inter
tf.t of the community to see that he Is pro
tected in that right.
If it Is possible for more '.work to be done In
this climate in comfort the year round, that
fact should not wholly be used for greater
productiveness, but should also serve to confer
stradler employment and greater leisure. In
other words, the people and the community
should b* the beneficiaries, not only In a mate
rial sense, but In an education and patriotic
sense, of the favor of nature.
Third â The remunerative employment of the
people leads to culture and civilization. In
which every member of the community has a
right to participate. Where a country Is rich
in natural resources or made prosperous by
the enterprise of Its citizens In commerce,
trade or manufactures, reasonable leisure anil
the means for culture should naturally follow.
Families of workingmen are better cared
for and educated and there Is, comparatively
spesking. nc evidence of life in the slum*,
which, unfortunately, is a part and parcel of
metropolitan. existence on the Eastern seaboard
and in Europe.
I think the people of this city live more out
of doora on account of the favorable climate,
and that the standard of dress and the need
of nourishing food are more exacting on that
account. The care, dress and education of a
family imposes considerable expense upfin the
wase-earner, and it would be unwise to check
this expansion of culture and civilization.
NEEDS GREATEB HERE,
Livernash followed with his rebuttal,
which* included more affidavits from car
men to the effect that their rents had
materially increased In the last few
months. Livernash also filed statements
from Dr. Jerome A. Anderson. Dr. "Wash
ington Dodge and James D. Phelan in ref
erence to carmen and the cost of their
living in comparison with Eastern cities.
Ex-Mayor Phelan's statement follows: ~
I desire to Â»ay. drat, that aus compared with
other ulaces which have come under my ob-
KTvutlon. the present material situation of
the working classes In general In San Fran
cisco is good. In most employments wages
nave beep. Increased to meet the Increased coat
of living.
Second â The standard of living Is hither In
San FrancUco than In the cun/tested districts
ot the East and Bur&pe. There are better
men â¢ enmloyed In, for instance, street-car ser
vice of San Francisco than In New York. Phil
adelphia cr Boston, for the reason. I believe,
that It requires courage and thrift to bring
thorn to the remote West, seeking to better
their fortunes; and men of California nativity
are affected by the higher standard which our
remote position and other circumstances have
created. - â¢ Â¦
The arbitration proceedings between the
carmen and . the United Railroads opened
again yesterday morning . after several
days' suspension. Attorney Moore on be
half ofc^lhe street car corporation filed a
number of affidavits relative to the cost
of living and also. in reference to the num.
ber of unemployed men In. San. Francisco
at. different times, and then rested his
case. 7. . Â¦ - '. : V.;.'- :

With ths exception of Figs and choice Plums
all descriptions under this head were In ample
supply and there was not much change In
prices. The situation In Bartlett Pears
showed some improvement. The river boats
continued to bring large shipments of contract
supplies, consigned direct to canners, but sup
plies In the open market, while plentiful, were
less liberal and choice lota in bulk continued
to command good prices. . No. 2 stock moved
off more freely, owing . to the shortage oX
higher grade offerings, and the wharves were
pretty well cleaned up. Choice Pears in wrap
pers from Martinez and highly colored â¢ Four
tier Gravennteln Apples were . in fair request
for ubisment and readily commanded the top
limitation. Good Plums, too, were wanted for
chipping, and desirable lots found quick sale
at full figures. Peaches Rnd Apricots were in
free supply and unchanged. Only a few small
boxes of Figs came In and they were quickly
disposed of. The cool, cloudy weather checked
trade in Melons, and as supplies were large,
prices ranged lower. Cantaloupes and Nut
meg Melons arrived freely from the river and
the /carry-over from Saturday was 1 large.
There were eighteen cars of Watermelons on
the railroad track and It was rumored that
the' Growers' Association would, shortly com
mence to cut' prices." Grapes 'wers dull, even
the very best offerings being hard 'to dlspos;
of. Berries stood about as previously quoted,"

selling en the closing out of collateral, and
there were indications of Investment buying
and of buying on a large scale by influential
capitalists. There was said to be an important
investment demand for foreign account. This
was a factor in the further . weakening of the
exchange market, which renewed talk of pos
â¢ible gold Imports. Fears of an unfavorable
Government crop report to be published after
the closing was an influence in weakening
Missouri Pacific and Atchison. The success
which attended the effort to check demorali
zation, following the similar success of last
Thursday, had an encouraging effect and there
was a more cheerful feeling at the clobe of the
day without an entire passing of nervousness
and apprehension.

SAN* BERNARDINO,. Aug. 10.â "Man
found one mile south of Helen. Think
was killed by train." is the message re
ceived this evening by the Coroner from
Oro Grande, a station on the desert side
of the range. Helen is a siding a few
miles from Oro Grande. Coupled with the
telegram is the fact that the conductor
of an incoming overland train to-day was
short a passenger upon arriving here.
The name of the passenger is unknown,
but he came from the East and was
ticketed for Temecula and should have
changed ears here.
Body Is Found on Bailroad Track.

A franchise asked for by the San Jose
and Santa Clara electric road over the
same routes on Market street from Santa
Clarar street to the depot will be sold next
Monday. There 13 much speculation as to
whether Beggs will bid on this.
Many believe that the Germanla Savings
Bank of San Francisco, which owned the
First-street road here, was trying to block
Rea's road. Beggs would not say whom
he represented, . but declares it was not
the First-street road. He says outside par
ities with plenty of money wanted the
franchise and were prepared to build the
road.
SAN JOSE. Aug. 10.â President James
W. Rea of the San Jose-Los Gatos Inter
urban Electric Railway, was forced ta
pay S5C3O for a franchise at the meeting
of the City Council this afternoon in or
der to secure a city terminal for his road.
This is fifty times the usual price of fran
chises in San Jose. It is considered a big
price, as the franchise only extends three
and one-half blocks from Santa Clara
street, down Market street to the broad
pau=re depot.
Rea had submitted the usual Jl<Â» bid.
but when it was opened William M.
Beggs, an attorney of this city, raised
It the required 10 per cent. ,
Rea responded with a like bid, and
Beggs kept bidding until it reached $49001
Rea then raised it to $5290 and the fran
chise went to him.

SANTA ROSA. Aug. 1Â».-Mrs. A. C.
Drayeur, wife of the aged wine maker
whose mysterious death in Healdsburg-'
Saturday is now being investigated by
the authorities, to-day confessed to
Sheriff Grace that she and her husband
had quarreled last Thursday evening and
came to blows, and that after he had
struck her she finally felled him with a
stick cf stovewood. According to her
story Drayeur soon regained conscious
ness. On Friday he arose from his bed
and started to walk across the Â£oor.
when he suddenly fell backward strik
ing his head violently against the win
dow sill. She elaims that it is from the
effects of the latter blow that death re
sulted. . An autopsy reveals the fact that
death was caused by a fracture of the
skull. The woman la being detained by
the authorities and in all probability will
bÂ« arrested to-morrow. The couple lived
at Healdsburg near the cannery and for
years have quarreled and drank to ex

addressed a communication to the Board
of Public Works in which it states that
the safety station. recently erected at the
Junction of Market, . Kearny and Geary
streets has met with the public approval
and demonstrated the necessity for more
of; such . conveniences at crowded Inter
sections along Market street. The com
munication also calls the attention of the
board to a resolution adopted by the
Board of Supervisors, which directs that
a similar station be erected at the Junc
tion of Market, Powell and Eddy streets.
The f. Merchants' Association earnestly
urges -that the Board of Public Works
'attend to the building of this new sta
tion as soon as the meeting of the G. A.

a safety station at this Junction becomes

was a creditable effort, 'the part was not

was not. what it should have been. How

Possibly- Blake has it in sheer, classic
Eilliclsm. In his white baby dress, with,
its pale blue sash, his golden curls tied
up with baby blue and his infantile, foot
gear, Mr. Blake's six feet are an 4 un
limited "license for laughter." He lives
up to -his get-up.. bravely, with a joyful
grotesquerie that governs the whole per
formance. , ...
Bernard -as Miss Pinchin is excruciate
ing. His make-up stopped the perform
ance for several hilarious seconds. He
looks like the schoolmarrri our dreams
used to make after* we had 'played
hookey, in his sour black gown, vicious
collar and ill-tempered wig.- He acts.it,
too. with unctuous relish. â¢
Dill is another delight, as the naughty
Erminegarter. who never learns her les
sons. He takes off his beard, but leaves
on his accent for the occasion, and looks
too sweet for anything in his rosy wig,
organdie frock and ' striped * stockings.
His prowess with the "spit ball" aroused
a ruck of reminiscent-admiration.
Kolb as the serving lady, Specky, adds
yet another to the figures of fun and has,
perhaps, nevc,r been more^ comically cast.
Maude AmOer, too, . as the little prin
cess, Is fetching as usual, particularly
well cast, in fact. Â¦ She has a charming
song, "Bug-a-Boo," that is most "prettily
chorused and set and tastefully sung. ;
There are many smaller parts, all well
taken, and a spirit and gayety about the
performance that is of the best one gets
at Fischer's. .The chorus,- dressed as
schoolgirls, looks Its prettiest,? sings its
best and adds largely to thclnterest.

, / y^. UO VASS ISS." the "first
fi II round " of tne n - w bin - at
\l it Fischer's, is good for five
minutes, its first live. But
it is not worth, hurrying din
ner for. "The Big Little Princess," that
takes up most of the evening, however,
spells another stunning success- for the
house. It is a burlesque, on .Mis. ; Bur
nett's new play of "The Little Princess.'"

York the management thoughtfully pro
vides Its synopsis.

abounds in .thrilling situations and. the
interest never" lags for a second, during,
the four acts. The hero of this melo
drama .struggles against the hereditary
curse of drink, and "Man's Enemy" de
scribes the course; of the "downward
path" from step to step with a vividness
that is startlingly effective. Tho play
show3 drink as a source of tears, an
guish, poverty, .crime, murder, and as a.
contrast to sin and its- folly -the glory of
virtue is happily illustrated. The pathos
of the piece is relieved by an abundance
of genuine humor,' but the whole play is
certainly a moral sermon In action. In
dealing with the drink . evil, the author
has held- "the mirror, up' to jiature." The
glamour and agreeable colors. that often
surround . temptation are ' set forth, and
the retributive effects are portrayed with
a master hand. "Man's Enemy" is a big
hit and will be'a strong drawing card all
this . week. Herschel Mayall, as Harry
Stanton, gavo-'an impersonation that was
strongly realistic. Stanton "goes the
pace," weds an adventuress, is disowned
by his father, but. is 'saved on the brink
of the abyss by the love of a noble
woman. Eugenia Thais Lawton, as Grace
Lisle, the girl whose self-sacrificing love

thetic, while Genevieve Kane portrayed
the adventuress In a strikingly clever
manner. Henry Shumer made a Â¦ vUIaln

Manager Newman of the Russ House
yesterday had his first experience with
the more serious side of managerial re
sponsibilities.. At an early hour in the
morning seven of -the house chamber
maids refused to proceed with their daily
duties unless an advance of salary was
forthcoming, and failing to get it they
walked out of the establishment. An
emergency corps ti composed mainly of
guests of the hotel and headed by Mrs.
Newman, was organized, and within an
hour's time the affairs of the Russ House
were running along smoothly.
Just about the time, however, that Man
ager Newman was congratulating himself
upon the ready manner in which he had
been able to overcome the difficulties that
had confronted him the lunch hour bad
arrived, and with it developed new and
more serious troubles for the new pro
prietor of the hostelry. The waiters had
decided that they should have more
wage3, and so informed Manager New
man. They would not take no for an an
swer, and five minutes after the noon
hour, while guests were pouring into the
dining-room for their meals, the waiters
were filing out through a rear entrance.
Again was \ the quick wit of the man
ager's wife brought into play. Marshaling
her husband, his brother and a score of
clerks, bell boys and porters into line,
she led them into the kitchen, whence
they were deployed out into the dining
room, and with words of encouragement
from- Mrs. Newman, and many of ths
guests the amateur waiters managed to
serve the hotel patrons, who were per
suaded to accept the inconvenience they
experienced In a good-natured way. In
the evening a new crew of waiters had
been secured and the day's troubles for
Newman were at an end.

The boy was carried to his home, a
block away, and left to the care of his
little sister. Her young mind grasped
the situation and the emergency spurred
her to action. Without hesitation she
started in search of medical aid. The
boy could not walk, for his foot pained
him and his ankle was already swelling.
With unusual foresight, gentleness and
devotion, she lifted her brother into a
toy wagon and started for the Park
Emergency Hospital, nearly a mile away.
It was a. peculiar party that halted be
fore the door of the hospital In an im
provised ambulance and requested the aid
of the doctor. After his wounds had been
dressed John and his sister departed for
home.
Trembling with fear, her girlish face
wet with tears of anxiety, little Kather
ine Walsh pulled the toy wagon contain
ing her injured brother John up to the
Park Emergency Hospital at 7:30 o'clock
last evening and sought the aid of the
physician in charge. '
Little John had been playing with-some
other children around the McAllister
street cars, and in some unaccountable
manner he fell in front of one that nearly
cost, him his life. The car was quickly
brought to a standstill and the crew,
aided by the passengers, pushed the ve
hicle back and extricated the little fel
low from his perilous position. On ex
amination It was found that his leg had
bten. bruished and his ankle sprained.
Alfred Schiele, a machinist, aged 32
years, who roomed at the home of Mrs.
Julia Schroder at 2026 Folsom street, sent
two pistol balls into his body yesterday
at noon acd died on his way to the City
and County Hospital. Schiele committed
suicide when he was about to be taken
into custody charged with an attempt to
commit an assault on the 15-year-old
daughter of his landlady.

house Schiele had been rooming for the
last feTT years, was away from her home
attending to her duties as a Janitor in one

ecd just as they were about to reach him
he fired the pistol again into his left tem

it is proposed to erect a clubhouse, was

D'Ancona held that the suppression of
the bulletin would look as'though there
is an attempt to conceal the true sanitary
condition In the city, but the Mayor dis
agreed with him and the discussion came
to an end.
"I have vetoed the appropriation for
the bulletin in the budget." said the
Mayor, "and I have refused to sign a de
mand for stationery for the purposs be
cause I think the board haa other funds
it can use."
The board ordered that the dome of tEe
City Hall be illuminated on the night* of
August 17 to 22, Inclusive.
D'Ancona desired to know the status
of the matter of the publication of the
monthly bulletin by the Health Board.
Mayor Schmitz answered that the board
had sufficient money -for the purpose of
printing the monthly bulletin without
making specific provision for it.
Mayor Schmitz then selected Super
