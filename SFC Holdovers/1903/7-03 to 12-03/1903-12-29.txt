ISSUE WITH PRESIDENT
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 28.â In offi
cial circles here* the delay ir. presenting
Russia's^rejflbr Is not regarded as omi
nous. 'Oii'ffi'. contrary, the fact that
Russia, in accordance with Japan's re
quest, Is actually reviewing the matters
in dispute. Is' regarded as a favorable
sign. It is pointed out that, had Rus
sia replied immediately, unfavorable
dfductions might have been drawn, and
although Russia believes her proposals
were extremely' conciliatory, containing
all the concessions Â»she can make, this
does not exclude the possibility of find
ing alternative propositions In some
portion of the general scheme of set
tlement, which may more closely coin
cide with Japan's wishes. If careful
consideration discloses the 'possibility
of such' a course, it is said, there is
every reason to believe it will gladly be
embraced. '"v"
.-' The consensus of opinion of those as
sociated .with the Government is th.it
the Czar Is so peacefully disposed "that
he will make such concessions to Japan
as are necessary to prevent* war, pro
vided r.o unforeseen events force the
hands of the Governments concerned.
At. the same time the Czar, it is pointed
out, agrees with those who believe that
preparation for war is the best safe
guard for peace and that apparent wil
lingness to allow matters to be sub
mitted, to a test of arms Is more likely
to lead to a satisfactory compromise
than an exhibition of overmuch peace
fulness. This unofficial opinion, how
ever,, believes the controlling party in
Russia; regards Korea as necessary to
the consolidation of Russian interests
in the Far East, and, therefore, is de
termined to prevent the peninsula fall
ing Into Japanese hands, and that any
concessions Russia now makes to Ja
pan, will be only with the object of'de
ferring "the difficulty untila^more sea
sonabieHlme. ..
There is not .likely to be much diffi
cultingiiT finding money in case of war.
A foreign j loan on acceptable \ tftrms Is

LONDON. Dec. 29.â Bennett Bur
lelgh In a cable message to the Daily
Telegraph from Tokio says:
"I confess my inability to see in Rus
sia's present attitude 'any other mean
ing than to precipitate a conflict. Rus
sia is not fully ready and cannot for
at least three months be able to main
tain her position If determinedly at
tacked. Time therefore is essential to
her, unless she utterly despises the
prow^-- of Japan. '
"It is true Count Lamsdorff long ago
openly declared that Russia consid
ered Manchurlan occupation to be a'
matter concerning o-nly herself and
China. Instead of temporizing, Russia
has employed plain language with Ja
pan.
"More than a fortnight ago Russia
again emphasized the same response
at Tokio. Yet Japanese statesmen ha,ve
since asked her to reconsider her re

It is evident that Jarecki was at

in the corridors, but none heard any

checkmate that group in the Northern
Pacific contest and the resultant panic
of May 9. 1901. Is the first attempt of

Harriman's plan is to vest absolute

City, one of its Eastern termini, and
Chicago; and which virtually 13 Us

CHICAGO. Dec. 28.â With pneumonia
establishing a new death record in Chi
cago and the County Hospital so crowd
ed that patients are sleeping on mat
tresses on the floor and less serious
cases being turned away, a serious prob
lem confronts the. Chicago health au
thorities.
The many varieties of weather from
which the city has suffered during the
last week are blamed not only for the
many pneumonia deaths, but for the
crowding of the hospitals in another
way. Within the last few days an un
usual number of persons injured by
falls on icy sidewalks have been taken
to the county institution, and though a
new emergency ward has been opened
all cai.not be cared fqr properly.
Last week's alarming increase in
deaths from nneumonia is made the
subject of the latest health bulletin.
During the seven days ending Saturday
pneumonia claimed 139 victims in Chi
cago, or 27 per cent of the total mor
tality.
PARIS, Dec. 2S.â In the Chamber of
Deputies to-day during the debase on
the amendments to the budget propos
als adopted in the Senate, Premier
Combes raised the question of confi
dence in the Government and obtained
a majority of 100. The point at issue
was the appropriation for the* special
service magistrates, which was sup
pressed by the Chamber and restored
by the Senate.
Several Deputies insisted that the Sen
ate in restoring the appropriation had
acted unconstitutionally, as it had not
the authority under the constitution to
propose financial expenditures.
Premier Combea cut short the debate
by declaring that he would not discuss
the constitutional question involved. He
said that the appropriation was essen
tial and that if it were not voted he
would tender his resignation.
The Chamber then restored several of
the appropriations suppressed by the
Senate, and consequently the budget
will go to the Senate again.
Delegates of the Ministerial groups in
the Chamber of Deputies held a meet
ing to-day and considered the candi
dates to succeed M. Bourgeois, who on
account of ill health has declined a re
election as President of the Chamber.
Paul Doumer, president of the Budget
Committee, and Dtienne Brisson are
prominent candidates. M. Jaures will
riot again' be a candidate for the Vice
Presidency of the Chariiber.

PEKING. Dec. 28.â Lien Fang, First
Secretary of the. Board of Foreign Af
fairs, visited Russian Minister Lessar
to*day and requested information con
cerning the intentions of the Russian
Government regarding the evacuation
of Manchuria.
Minister Lessar, in reply, said that
nothing could be done at present with
a view to evacuation for two reasons.
In the first place, the Minister point
ed out, the cold weather made It im
possible to -remove the troops from
the4r present position, besides which
there were no barrack accommodations
to be had elsewhere; and in the sec
ond .place, he said, it would endanger
Russian interests to undertake evacua
tion during the progress of the nego
tiations between Russia and Japan,
for the reason that Japan might seize
the opportunity to invade Manchuria.
The Chinese Government is so alarm
ed at the prospects of becoming in
volved in the seemingly prospective
war that it would prefer that Russia
remain in ] control of Manchuria. As
an alternative the Foreign Office has
indicated to the Ministers that a set
tlement- satisfactory to China would
be Â»he to the effect that Russia and
Japan should retain their respective
treaty rights in 'Korea and Manchuria
if they agree not to attempt to obtain
further advantages in either country.

Special Difpatch to The Call
Governor Wells, in an Interview, ap
proved President Cannon's attitude and
said that if such a course as outlined
would break the strike it would be a
desirable end.
A special to the Tribune from Win
ter Quarters, Utah, says that the
timely arrival of soldiers prevented
serious trouble between striking min
ers and ji number of company guards,
who were evfeting families from com
pany houses. The unmarried strikers
submitted quietly to eviction, but
when the company guards attempted
to force the married men to leave
their homes they were attacked and
routed by 150 Finns, who had been
watching the evictions. The arrival
of the soldiers quelled the disturbance.
Twenty of the company g-uards were
budly beaten. The evictions will con
tinue until the end of the year.
"The Mormon church has openly de-,
dared war on organized labor in Utah,
especially tht? United Mine Workers of
America, having, called upon members
to take the places of Carbon County
coal strikers. The State administra
tion, militia, courts and peace officers
have been turned ever to the Utah Fuel
Company at the behest of the Mormon
church. United States Senator-elect
ReeJ Smoot, one of the twelve men who
control the Mormon church, owing al
legiance to this hierarchy that has at
tacked us. would be a. dangerous and
powerful enemy to organized labor in
the Senate. In self-defense union labor
should do all in its power t<r prevent
the seating of Smoot as a rebuke to
the Mormon church for its uncalled for
interference in this industrial dispute."
KELLIHER AND WELLS TALK.
Kelliher paid to-night: "This official
action of the Mormon church against
the coal strikers -is the final blow. We
have endured things that the people of
other States would scarcely believe. In
Carbon County justice has been blind
folded and led around by the Utah Fuel
Company; strikers and organizers have
been arrested on trumped-up charges
and railroaded to jail or out of the
country: witnesses have been terrorized
and abused; even the Governor of the
State has declared against us."
National Organizer Kelliher, who has
been directing the fight in the coal
Holds of I'tah for the United Mine
Workers, to-night sent the following
telegram to President Mitchell of his
organization and to Samuel Gompers.
president vt the American' Federation
of Labor:
This address has created a sensation
in union labor circles and Â«tcps are
being taken to retaliate with an at
tempt to array organized labor
throughout the country against Sen
ator Smoot. To-night, following a
lengthy conference of labor leaders, the
machinery was set in motion for an
organized fight against Smoct by union
labor throughout the United States. A
call was issued for the assembling of
the Utah State Federation oÂ£ Labor in
special meeting and special sessions of
every labor union in the Stacr? will be
called to pass resolutions "ot protest
against the utterances of thi Mormon
leader and probably against the seating
of Senator Smoot.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Dec. 28â From
the pulpit of the Mormon Tabernacle
has come an official declaration of war
against the United Mine Workers of
America and an appeal . for recruits
frum the Mormon membership to fill
the places of the striking coal miners
of Carbon County. This action has re
ceived the indorsement of Governor
Wells., who is a son of the church. .
For several weeks the operators have
had the active support of <hÂ» Mormons
in attempting to nil the places of the
strikers at Winter Quarters. Clear
Creek. Sunnyside- and Castle Gate, but
openly the leaders of the Latter Day
Saints have not heretofore taken sides
in the controversy. All Uoubt of their
attitude has been set at rest i:y Angus
M. Cannon, who, speaking in the great
Tabernacle, asked that every tffort be
put forth by the faith to fill the mines
of the Utah Fuel Company. He said
the company . wanted 400 coal- minors
and announced the wages offered and
the conditions of employment. Presi
dent Cannon called upon the bishops
and other officers of the church to make
the call known jit their ward arid dis
trict meetings and to do all in their
power to keep the mines open".

; KANSAS CITY, Mo., Dec. 28.- 7 The
i Russian Government has just placed
: an order with Armour & Co. for 1,500.
| 000 pounds of messmeat. The order
calls for the delivery of the .meat at
I San Francisco by January 22. The
; meat, it is said, is for the use of the
! Russian army and its destination Is
| said to be Port Arthur.
j It appears that the order was re-
I ceived in this city last week and al
j ready a third of the quantity of meat
| has* been started west. The order came
; through a San Francisco firm. The
â¢ management of the packing-house here
' was unable or unwilling to say whether
j future orders from the same source
i were expected, nor could rt state the
I exact destination of the shipments. The
: order was for mess beef, or that class
! of meat capable of being kept for a long
| period. * .
! Getz Bros. & Co. of this city have
: received a contract from the Russian
: Government to supply 3,000,000 pounds
of beef. The beef is to be packed for
j army and navy use. According to the
; statements* made yesterday by a rep
i resentative of Getz Bros., the contract
'Â¦ with the Russian o6vernment was
San Francisco to Be Supply Depot for
Far Eastern Forces.
RUSSIA'S BIG BEEF ORDER.
One reason why the British alarmist
news fails to convince the Russians is
the perfect understanding here of the
benefits Great Britain derives from the
strained situation. It was known here
a year ago that Great # Britain was
planning to occupy Thibet and extend
the railroad to a point in the Yangtse
Valley which is reachable by gunboats
from the sea. Great Britain's forward
movement at this time excites both ad
miration and rage, the former for the
clever political move, the latter because
Russia is so much occupied in the Far
East that she is unable to prevent
Great Britain creating her own Man
churia in the Yangt o provinces. It 13
pointed out here that the present situa
tion affords Great Britain the same op
portunity as actual war between Rus
sia and any third power.

The fact that the contract was given

A wedding is on the cards for Thurs
day night that will come as a pleasant
surprise to the younger members of the
smart set, when DK A. D. . Prentice
will take unto himself a bride. Miss
Florence Long, an Eastern girl of much
beauty and social prominence. And
therein lies a tale of a wedding hast
ened by the stern demands of duty.
Dr. Prentice has for three years been
practicing in the Philippines, where he
has achieved a splendid reputation. Re
turning to this city on a visit to his
mother, Mrs. H. C. Botsford, he jour
neyed to New York to spend some time
in the Gotham hospitals, and it was
during this sojourn that the young
physician lost his heart.
A few days ago peremptory orders
arrived from Manila summoning him
back to his post. There was much use
made of the wires that stretch away to
Gotham, and the result is that the wed
ding day was named and the fair bride
is now speeding on her way to this city.
It is expected that Miss Long will ar
rive this evening, when she will be
greeted by the family of the groom.
The wedding will necessarily be a
very quiet affair and will be witnessed
only by members of the family. It is
sincerely to be regretted that so little
time will elapse between the coming
and going of the fair bride, as it is cer
tain that many courtesies would have
been extended to her. , \
Speculation over his probable suc
cessor in the purchasing and supply
department of the road centers around
Richard .Stevenson, who has been
Manger Schwerin's assistant for a
number of years and was connected
with the department when the* latter
assumed charge of it.
The employes of the Southern Pa
cific Company are looking forward to
the announcement in a few days of
the retirement of R. P. Schwerln from
j the position of manager of. the pur-
I chasing and supply department of
i that corporation. With his new duties
j as general manager of the Portland
i and Asiatic Steamship Company,
j which were imposed on him two
weeks ago by E. H. Harriman/and his
responsibilities as vice president and
general manager of the Pacific Mail
j Steamship Company, Mr. Schwerin is
â¢said to have concluded to sever con
! nections with the railroad corpora
tion. â¢ Â» .
â¢ As a matter of fact, the office of
manager of the purchasing and sup
ply department of the Southern Pa
cific is no longer the inviting position
of several years ago, for it has been
made subordinate to the place recent
ly created in Chicago for Harriman's
friend, W. S. V. Thorne, who has been
given the title of director of purchases
of the Harriman lines. . Through the
latter's office all purchases of material
for the Harriman lines are to be made
hereafter, when the work of standard
izing the different roads is completed.
Mr. Schwerin does not take kirfdly to
the proposition of dividing responsi
bilities with some one else and It is
said that this fact has had some in
fluence in his determination to give
up â¢ his present position with the

General MacArthur had. a busy day
yesterday. He has been away from
his post for a month and a large pile
of work had accumulated for his in
spection and supervision. His,atten
tion was largely occupied with look
ing into the new division and depart
ment commands, which will go into
effect January 15, 1904. The Pacific
division will then embrace the De
partment 0$ California and the De
partment-of. the Columbia, with head
quarters at San Francisco.
The Department of California in
cludes the States of California and

coincides closely with, the length meas

420 feet. This may be called low water
level, as the river is about at its lowest

measurement will make the bridge the

Heavy Penalty Imposed Upon Union
Men Who Violated an Injunction.
NEW YORK, Dec. 28. â Vice Chan
cellor Pitney denied an appeal for
mercy in Jersey City to-day for the
strikers of the Frank & Dugan silk
mills in Paterson, including two men
and six girls, who were found guilty
of contempt of court by him in the
summer or 1901. The contempt lay In
the disregard of the court's injunction
forbidding the strikers from interfering
with the employes of Frank & Dugan,
or to "make ijt uncomfortable" for
those who desired to work.
The case was carried to the Court of
Appeals and the United States Su
preme Court, which held that it had
no jurisdiction. An appeal was then
made unsuccessfully to the Court of
Pardons.
The defendants also were ordered by
the Chancery Court to pay costs
amounting to $540. The court re
iterated with 'emphasis that it is illegal
to make it "uncomfortable" for any
body who wishes to work.
"That is the law of the land," said
the court. "It has always been the

The officers were in no way molested
or annoyed by the crowd, "which fol
lowed them closely all the ' time.
Neither by words nor looks did the
populace display any hostility. The
Colombian battery fired a rear admi
ral's salute as Admiral Coghlan drew
off for the Olympia.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon Gov
ernor Insignares, accompanied by a
numerous retinue, boarded the Olym
pia for the return visit and remained
for fifteen minutes. When the Gov
ernor and his retinue were disem-
NO DISPLAY OF HOSTILITY.
Governor Tnsignares; surrounded by
â¢x large number of secretaries and aids,
received Admiral Coghlan' in the large
salon of the palace, to which the popu
lace was admitted. The latter, however,
were srparated from the dignitaries by
a railing.
Admiral Coghlan and Governor In-
Eirnarcs exchanged the regulation for
malities, the crowd listening attentive
ly. The Governor said he would re
turn the visit immediately, whereupon
Admiral Coghlan and party returned
to the Olympia.
Admiral Coghlan then arranged to
pay an official visit to Dr. Jose Insig
nares, the Governor of Bolivar, which
he did in the afternoon, accompanied
by Captain H. G. Colby. Both officers
were in full dress uniform. A big crowd
gathered at the docks to meet Admiral
Coghlan and Captain Colby, and it si
lently followed the carriage containing
the â¢bfflcera. through the streets to the
pai&ce, where another big crowd as
sembled. * ;Â¦ . *
AdmiraJ Coghlan then sent a bpat
ashore to communicate with United
States Consul Orr, but it was learned
that Orr had left Cartagena about a
fortnight ago for Barranquilla. The
British Vice Consul at Cartagena, who
Is very sick and is not expected to live,
had undertaken to look after the
United States' interests pending the
arrival of Orr's successor.
The Olympia passed the Colombian
warships and proceeded to Cartagena,
which is eight miles from the entrance.
Anchoring about a mile from the town,
the Olympia hoisted the Colombian flag
at her main and fired a salute of twen
ty-one guns. Shortly thereafter the Co
lombian battery at the edge of the town
returned the salute.
j COLON, Dec. 28.â Admiral Coghlan's
flagship, the cruiser Olympia, arrived
. here this afternoon from Cartagena,
! bringing A. M. Beaupre, Minister to
1 Colombia, and Mrs. Beaupre. Mr. and
, Mrs. Beaupre arrived at Cartagena from
i Bogota last Saturday, and boarded the
I Olympia on her arrival yesterday aft-
I ernoon. The Olympia immediately sailed
â¢ for Colon. Minister Beaupre will sail
j for New York on the steamer Yucatan
: to-morrow.
The reception of the Olympia at Car
1 tagena was friendly. As the Olympia
j ran in toward the entrance Â«to Carta
j gena harbor she descried the Colom
â¢ liian < ruiser Cartagena, four miles dis
; tant. making every effort to reach the
entrance and to pass into the lagoon
: ahead of the Olympia, which she suc
â¢ ceeded in doing.
The Olympia steamed slowly to the
' t< rtuous entrance between two old
Â¦ Spanish forts, which apparently were.
j deserted, and found that the Colombian
: t miser had taken up a position a short
; distance inside, but commanding . the
Â¦ entrance. It was learned subsequently
â¢ that the Cartagena had grounded there
and that later she was towed into port.
SALUTES ARE EXCHANGED.
It can be safely said that the influ
ence of tirne and a calmer considera
tion of the situation are bringing
about, though slowly, a greater readi
ness on the part of Colombia to ac
cept the inevitable and to get all she
possibly can from the republic of Pan
ama by diplomacy.
Beaupre said he thought any trouble
between the United States and Colom*
hi?, was improbable and that the Amer
icans in Colombia â of whom there were
very few, there being only about ten
in Bogota and some prospectors in An
tloquia and other placesâ were in^ ho
danger of molestation.
General liafacl Reyes has been bitter
ly criticized in Bogota for having in
vited the Panaman commissioners to
breakfast when here aboard the Canda.
The General's action is considered un
dignified and a sign of weakness. Gen
eral Reyes' continued absence at Wash
ington is resulting In a certain slight
weakening of his influence and pres
tige.
Minister Beaupre had a good trip
down the Magdalena River and was
greatly gratified to find that the Olym
pia had been sent to Cartagena to bring
him to Colon. The Bogotan authori
ties extended every courtesy to the
Minister, who left Bogota on a special
train and was carried down the river
on a special steamer. He made the
trip frdm Bogota to Cartagena in seven
days.
Comparatively little information as
to the general situaton could be gained
at Cartagena. * There are probably
SoOO troops there, and there ar"e report
ed to be 5000 at Barranquilla. The
Government! is doubtless slowly con
centrating troops at Barranquilla and
moving them toward Titumali. in small
numbers. There are 1200 Colombian
soldiers at Titumali and vicinity to-day
and this number is gradually being in
creased.
It is expected the Bogota Govern
ment had spies in -Cartagena, who
were carefully watching for any evi
dence of disloyalty, since the Cacta
genian authorities evidently desired to
avoid all unnecessary friendliness with
the Americans.
No political references were made
during the interviews, except by the
chief of the Cartagena customs, who.
while aboard the Olympia, proposed
with great earnestness a toast to the
continuance of the = frierfdly relations
between the United State 3 and Colom
bia, .^k
coxcextkatim: op troops.
While Admiral Coghlan and the
other Americans were treated civilly
and courteously, and while their visit
was not marked by the slightest un
pleasant or untoward incident, it was
evident that the authorities in Carta
gena were not very glad to see the
Olympia and were pleased when she
took her departure.
Admiral Coghlan was careful to leave'
at the earliest possible moment, evi
dently remembering the absolute loy
alty of. the Department of Bolivar to

entertain hope of a satisfactory re
sponse by this Government. Already,
most of the legation files have been
packed and arrangements completed
for placing them in storage here. Gen
eral Reyes for several days has denied
himself to callers. It. is believed that,
while the reply of Hay has not been
made, sufficient information has been
obtained by the Colombian representa
tives* in the interviews they have had
with pie Secretary to enable them to
forecast its conclusions.
The preparaions going on for closing
the affairs of the legation would seem
to indicate that General Reyes and Dr.
Herran are awaiting, as a< matter of
form and diplomatic courtesy, the of
ficial communication of Hay setting
forth the reasons why this Government
cannot accept their view of the Pan
ama situation before severing diplo
matic relations with the .United States.
The statement of M. Bunau-Varilla,
the Panama Minister, that his Govern
ment is willing to assume a portion of
the Colombian 'debt, has been received
at the British embassy and transmitted

appeared In The Call:. -

"To the Honorable Board of Super
':â¢â¢â¢ visors of Alameda County:
SUPERVISORS INVESTIGATE.
This -story is known to several offi
cials and it has been told by Mr. Burke
to more than one and there is plenty
of corroboratlon.
â¢ The first chance that this Ftory had
to come to the surface*. In full public
view Was when the first MacMullan
claim was put through last week. Up
to that time and even at that time the
Board of Supervisors had absolutely
no Information of what MacMullan had
been doing. HJs reports had been made
to Assessor Dalton and there was noth
ing to show when the tax rolls were
turned over last July whether Mr. Dal
ton's regular deputies or MacMullan
had discovered the large Increase In
taxable property In Alameda County.
The work was supposed to* have been
that of Mr.' Dalton's office and Jt passed
for such until Saturday last when Mac-
Mullan finally came out of the brush
and openly declared ' that he was the
man that had "discovered" the ferry
boat franchises, the water in liake Cha
bot and a total of about. <3.000,000 of
property upon which he wanted his
commission, the first Â¦Installment of
which he had applied for in hio claim
for $1099 15. ' *
This angered MacMullan, Who,- being
facile of pen, proceeded to write sundry
letters to the Council criticizing, abus
ing -and threatening su'ch men as Presi
dent Dbrnin.and Chairman John L.
Howard of the Finance Committee and
others of- like character. This did not
help MacMullan in the eyes of the city
officials nor the public, and when the
Council refused to receive any more
communications from him* unless
couched in proper language MacMullan
reached the end of his rope In that
quarter. .
Since tho county expose there are
many happy officials around the City
Hall of Oakland.
City Council became aware of these
events, and. they made some Investiga
tions of their own, and exactly the same
story was told them. Thereupon the
City Council promptly threw MacMul
lan. and his proposition to "discover"
unassessed property out into the cold,

Although frequent stories of the pos
sibilities of Stockton and Fresno. being
connected by an electric line have been
repeatedly denied by those whose
names have been connected with the
reported projects, it is again rumored
that K. H. Harriman of the Southern
Pacific Company is prepared to under
take the construction of a line between
those two cities, and it Is said that that
project was what prompted him to re
cently acquire the majority of the stock
in the Stockton Street Railway Com
pany, whose office is soon to be moved
to this city.
Frank W. Webster, former* â¢ chief
clerk of the construction department of
the United Railroads, who recently re
signed to accept the suDerintendency
of the Stockton street road, and Henry
Lynch, who has just retired from the
head of the construction department of
the United Railroads, have been in
Stockton for several days looking care
fully over the street road. The latter
it is said, Ip to be completely over
hauled In the near future, and the
plans for the improvements are' to be
prepared under the direction of Lynch.
While In the Slough City Lynch and
"Webster have heeit Inspecting outlets
from the southern end of Stockton. It
is" reported that surveys southward for
several hundred miles in the direction
of Fresno have already been made, and
the work of construction of an exten
sion of the street road in that direction
could be Inaugurated on very short no
tice. Those who pretend to know rs

aration for this new line In order to
anticipate any similar enterprise that
might be projected by other parties.

leaped the dog. striking Cameron and

, Whereupon, so Mr. Burke told Mr.
Mitchell, he had an interview with Mac-
Mullan. At that interview MacMullan
Informed him of the work '"that' 1 had
been delegated to him by the "Alameda
County Board of Supervisors, and add
ed that he knew where the Southern
Pacific Company was not paying the
county of Alameda $2700 in taxes that
was due the county, and that under his
appointment he J:vould be compelled to
report the samq to the Assessor, but
that he once mere wanted to en.terf.he
field of Journalisfh. and if $500 could. he
secured with wftlch he could start- a
paper In Alami/da County he might
overlook this assessable property, or give
up his position altogether.'
With cautious! regard for the affairs
of his company Mr. Burke ; took the
matter under, advisement, and he. re
ferred the whole proposition .to William
F. Herrin. then general solicitor for the
corporation. Mh Herrlri's reply, as re
peated by Mr. J*urke to Mr. Mitchell,
was that if the' 'Southern Pacific Com
pany owed Alampda County $2700 taxes
it would pay It. Hut.it. would not put up
a cent for blackball. That was an ugly
word, but as.thif story finally reached

According to the story. told by Mr.
Burke to Mr." Mitchell, and since re
peated to others, 5500 was asked by
MacMullan from the Southern Pacific
Company in consideration of which. he
would refuse the position of "tax ex
nert," to which he had been appointed
by the Alameda County Supervisors.
As this story ran. various communica
tions, Innocent In themselves, passed
from MacMullan to various officials of
the big railroad corporation, from Pres
ident Harriman down, and \ In -the
course of railroad events these commu
nications found themselves- In the tax
department of the company and In the
hands of Mr. Burke. â¢ . â¢ <
The letter from Mr. Kruttschnitt did
not contain the contents of the letter
sent by MacMullan to Mr. Harriman,
but Mr. Mitchell began to wonder what
MacMullan was doing and why he was
writing to Mr. Harriman. and who au-'
thorized him to communicate with any
one connected with the Southern Pa
cific Company. Still, as nothing more
developed, and as there was nothing In
the action of MacMullan to arouse
suspicion, the Kruttschnitt- letter was
allowed to fade from Mr. Mitchell's
mind for the time being.
The matter was forcibly revived when
an accidental meeting between Jere
Burke of the Southern Pacific Company
and Mr. Mitchell occurred in the Pal
ace Hotel In San Francisco. Mr. Burke
immediately wanted to know from Mr.
Mitchell what kind of a tax expert he
had appointed In Alameda County, and
in reply to Mr- Mitchell's question, of
"Why?" he told a story that hung upon
the mysterious communication received
from General Manager Kruttschnitt by
Mr. Mitchell.
.4 .
OAKLAND. Dec. 28.â Investigation
of the remarkable claim of C. S. Mac-
Mullan for discovering unassessed
property in Atameda County was be
gun by the Board of Supervisors to
day at the demand of Chairman' John
Mitchell. As a basis for the investiga
tion the board, upon the motion of
Chairman Mitchell, rescinded all action
that had been taken, both upon the
MacMullan claim and the alleged
agreement, that was made last April,
and the matter has been placed in tlie
hands of the Finance Committee to
complete the investigation.
But there Is an' infinitely more, se
rious phase to this matter than th*
mere trapping of the Supervisors into
authorizing an unmerited agreement.
Various county and city officials assert
that they hold in their possession evi
dence that C. S. MacMullan, after he
had been employed by the Board of
Supervisors to look up this unassessed
property, offered the Southern Pacific
Company, for a consideration of $500,
to divert his attention from. any of its
unassessed property. :
The storv of this attempt upon the
part of MacMullan to trade upon the
agreement he secured from the Super
visors last April is best told by describ
ing the way in which the discovery wa3
made by the officials in question.
Some time ago John Mitchell, chair
man of the Board of Supervisors, re
ceived from Julius Kruttschnitt. gen
eral manager of the Southern Pacific
Company, a communication, addressed
to him as chairman of the board. The
letter announced that E. H. Harriman,
president of the Southern Pacific Com
pany,' had received a communication
cent him by "your county tax expert"
and that the communication in question
had been referred to him and by him
had been referred to the tax depart
ment of the Southern Pacific Company.

meeting for a renewal of his license.
The Trustees will then set a time for
the hearing of the charges of the church
people against him.
The' matter came rp in the form of a
recommendation from the License Com
mittee, Trustees Hoff and Staats, for
the renewal of the licenses of nineteen
saloons. Fisher's name was not on the
list. Trustee Dowd said Fisher .ought
to be given a license to run his place
until the board had" investigated .the
charges of the church people against
him, and Fisher's attorney also de
manded that privilege for his client.
BERKELEY. Dec. 2S.â The Board of
Trustees to-night refused to renew the
license of "Sam" Fisher, the West
Berkeley saloon-keeper, who assaulted
the men and women of the Trinity
Church while they were conducting a
"rummage sale" near his place. Fish
er's present license will expire with the
end of the year and then he will have
to shut the doors of his place.
While the question of Fisher's license
is not'allogether seftled, as he intends
to renew hfs application, .it is unlikely
that"he will receive any favors from the
Trustees, the majority of them being
against him. The. vote to-night indi
cated that when the matter comes up
for final . settlement Fisher's friends
will be Trustees Hoff and Down, and
his opponents Trustees Rickard, Con
nor. Ferrier and Ryder, with Trustee
Slaats uncertain.
The retirement of these men will
create a total of three vacancies In the
regular police allotment. That which
was caused 'by the killing of Policeman
James II. Smith has not bÂ»en lllied. At
to-day's meeting of the Commissioners
the matter of appointments tr, the reg
ular force was laid over until the next
meeting, which will be held on Monday.

Chief of. Police Hodgklns has report
ed to. the Police Commissioners that
Patrolmen C. E. Kentz and William
Tlllotson, recent appointees of the
board, are physically disqualified from
proper performance* of thrir duties.
Kentz, according to .the Chief's state
ment made this afternoon to the Com
missioners, is a sufferer from varicose
veins. Tlllotson is ailing from rheu
matic gout and the Chief nsserta cannot
do patrolman's duty efficiently because
of his trouble.
Based upon that report tho Commis
sioners directed the Chief to nsk- both
men for their resignations.
Kentz and Tlllotaon were appointed
to the force on November 1. They each
worked about three weeks during No
vember and were compelled tr. lay off,
not returning to the beats until De
cember 15. But since* then both men
have been regularly on duty.

Dr. J. P. Tormey performed an au
topsy this afternoon and he found
that Moran had died from exposure.
The inquest will be held at 10 o'clock
next Sunday morning. . .
For thirty years the old man had
lived alone in a little two-room house
on the Mulford Landing road and he
was seen last night as he got off the
Haywards car and started toward his
home about 9 o'clock. At that time he
was returning from a visit to U'.s
brother. Darby Moran, who lives at SOI
Jefferson street.
The deceased was unmarried, and
besides hie brother he leaves one Bister,
who also resides in Oakland. The body
has been removed to James McManus'
undertaking parlors and the funeral
â¢will be held from the home of Darby
Moran.
Tho dead body of James Moran, an
old resident of San Leandro. was found
in a pool in San L^andro Creek shortly
before 9 o'rfock this morning by Petc-ina
Santos, a 14-year-old clrl, who resides
on Alvarado street, at the foot of which
the body was lying. Moran, who was 79
years old, had evidently become con
fused in the darkness and had fallen
over the bank of the creek in the night.
The body was found leaning against
the bank of the pool with the head and
Fhoulders out of the water, showing
that the old man had not been
drowned, but had died from exposure
after sliding into the water, from which
owing: to his age he was unable to es
cape.
-.Petcina Santos, who found the body,
was badly frightened and ran home,
Bcreaming that there was a "dead man
In the creek." After she had become
calm enough to tell her parents what
ehe had seen Deputy Coroner Morgan
Â¦was notified and the body was removed
to the branch Morgue.

An event of importance to men en
gaged in carpentering was the jomt
meeting of San Francisco fcouncil,
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and
Joiners of America, and San Francises
Branch, Amalgamated Society of Car
penters, last Saturday evening at the
headquarters of .the Building Trades
Council. It was the first gathering in
accordance with the decision of M. A.
Strasser. the umpire to whom the two
central. bodies referred their differences
last August in Chicago, and It meant
another step in the evolution of union
ism in the building trades.
The .union of the two great bodies of
carpenters is to be effective for o.i 3
yfear. The trade rules are to be fortntfj
immediately and the constitution
adopted a twelvemonth hence. Tho
brotherhood is strictly an American in
stitution, while the Amalgamated Car
penters have their headquarters Jn
Erigland.
The step taken here Saturday night
was taken in every other city in the
United States. 1
J. C. Williams, vice president of "the

FLORENCE. Colo., Dee. 28.â Manager
Hower of the Dorcas mill, who recently
discharged all his, employes who be
longed to the Western Federation of
Miners because of the threat of the
Cripple Creek Mine 'Owners' Associa
tion to shut off hi3 ore supply if he did
not, was to-day notified by the owner
of the Morganstein coal mine that no
more coal could be procured for thcÂ»
mill at that mine. The coal miners had
threatened to strike if the Dorca.^ was
given coal. The Morganstein is one of
the mines that acceded to the demands
of the men, and has been supplying
many plants here with coal.
Colonel Verdeckberg at once dis
patched Major Xaylor with a squad to
capture the attorney and his weapons.
The lawyer's office was found barri
caded and G'over appeared with a re
volver, declaring that he would shoot
the first man who attempted to break
down the door. The place was sur
rounded by troons and orders were
given to shoot Glover if he appeared
again with his weapon.
Later Glover reappeared and several
shots were exchanged, the attorney
being wounded in the arm, after which
he was captured. *
TELLtTRIDE. Colo.. Dec. 25.â It i3
reported here to-day that former At
torney General Eugene Engley of Crip

tified that unless he leave the district
at once he will be arrested. He is said
to have asserted that he would ijot go.
and that if arrested he would make no
effort to secure bail.
CRIPPLE CREEK. Colo., Dec~J!8.â
Attorney John M. Glover, formerly a
Congressman from Missouri, defied the
military to-day, barricading himself in
his office and surrendering: only after he
had received a bullet in the arm.
Colonel Verdeckberjr. commanding the
militia foi<!es in the district, to-day re
ceived a letter from Glover denying the
legality of the recent order for the sur
render of arms by the citizens of the
district In hi3 letter Glover referred to
Governor Peabody as "a cheap anarch
ist." He declared that he had two suns
in his office and defied the military to
take them from him.
This is not the first time that GasÂ°n
has been arrested on a charge cf burg
lary. About two months prior to the
time he was shot by Mrs. Fitzgibbon
he was discovered in the Var. Ness
bazaar on Market street, near Van
Ness avenue. When arrested he said
he had entered the place to gret some
rice, as his stepsister was to get mar
ried. He was charged with burglary,
but Police Judge Mogan reduced the
charge to petty larczny and pjt Gagen
on his good b?havior. Tho case had
not been finally disposed of when he
was shot, but later it was stricken from
the calendar.
A citizen notified Policeman J. B.
Charlostoo about 6 o'clock yesterday
morning that the cigar storÂ« of Nor
man A. Brown. 20/ Marshall squafe.
Had been entered by a burglar. Charles
ton hurried to the place and discovered
a pane of glass broken in the front
window. He went inside and found
Joseph A. Gagen, who could not give
any satisfactory explanation of his
presence there. The proprietor was
sent for : and he said that a box of
cigars and several packages of cig
arettes were missing. The cash register
had also been forced open and twenty
seven slugs had been stolen. Nothing;
was found upon Gagen, but he was
booked at the City Prison on a charge
of burglary.
Gagen is the man who was shot five
times by Mrs. Etta Fitzgibbon in her
rooms, 872 Market street, on May 3.
She claimed that Gagen attempted to
choke her and she shot him in self
defense. On December 12 she was sen
tenced by Judge Cook to serve four
teen years in San Quentin for the
shooting. There was some question as
to her sanity, but Medical Superintend
ent Stone of the Napa Asylum, to
which f=he was sent, reported that she
was sane enough to be punished for
her crime. Gagen is lame from the
effects of one of the' wounds in his leg.

Evangelical entireties in Philadelphia.
In Xew York, in Baltimore, Boston and
other cities, such as St. Louis and now
Chicago, were carrying forward active
vÂ»ork. and the tinv-s showed there was
a great force behind and above them,
he continued. There never was a time.
Fajd Dr. Macintosh, when the spirit of
prayer obtained as to-day; there was
n<Â»ver an hour in the Ja^t twenty years
vhen. fo many men and women were
wrestling for tho souls of brother and
sister.
' There was a general movement of the
kind all over the country, said Pro
fessor Macintosh, and in Oakland the
evanjreljcal bodies had combined, as
had been the case in some of the great
er cities of the East. The reports which
had been received of the united move
ment were wonderful, and they had
reat-on to be thankful.
KKUCJIOrS HOIHES COMBIXK.
They must be agreed to labor for the
pood name of the city, and he ventured
to say that no man had a right to live
in a city for whose good name he had
no care. As .Christ's men they must do
something: aggressive for the Master:
it was higrh time that they did some
thinp for the souls of men. He asked
the question whether they were pre
pared to do anything cs a united body.
It meant work, said Dr. Macintosh,
continuous work. He admitted that
they had to count on the cost. It might
cost them a deal of mortification and it
would cost them self -consecration; it
would cost them in practical, continu
ous ministration. He a?ked them while
in mass-meeting to consider whether
they were prepared to follow the plans
for a deliberate "holy war."
Professor Macintosh. D. D., was the
first to s=peak on the subject, and he
drew a parallel between San Francisco
and Ephesus, a city the center of which
was given up to vil^ness and the
haughty and devoted worship of Diana.
That city, was converted, he said, by
twelve men filled with the spirit of the
Holy Ghost â twelve men who were
plowing with fervor that came from a
new vision of God. If those twelve men
<ould effect that change in Enhesus. he
doubted not that the union evan
gelistic movement could effect the up
lifting and the salvation of- souls in this
city. Dr. Macintosh drew a picture of
the vast importance of San Francisco
in the future history of the nation. He
asked that the ministers band them
selves together in combined spirit and
love to win ihis splendid West for Jesus
i.nd the Master.
A mass-meeting of clergymen of this
<.ity interested in union evangelistic
work met yesterday afternoon at the
Young Men's Christian Association
luilding. the Rev. Dr. H. H. Bell, in
the absence of Bishop Hamilton, tem
porary chairman, presiding. There were
nearly fifty clergymen present and
many stirring addresses were delivered
in support of a great religious revival.
Filcher was going along the trail,
which is unused and lies not more than
half a mile from Auburn. He was in
search of a spring that was ence fa
mous, its waters being credited with
the power to restore hair to bald heads.
As he walked, talking with his brother,
who accompanied him on his jaunt, he
saw before him the telescope basket,
in which there were several articles of
clothing, moldy with long lying. Among
the articles were several shirts that
had on them thÂ« imprint of the Ex
celsior laundry in Oakland. A pair of
trousers was found, witn thv creases
in them and looking unworn. There
were also a pair of sleeve buttons and
some other trinkets. F rther'down the
trail was a bunch of collars, aldo moldy.
All the clothing was In fair condition
and the inference was that the owner
thereof was in comfortable circum
stances. But where was he?
Mr. - Filcher went directly back to
Auburn and notified the Sheriff and
the Coroner of what' he Iiad seen. A
party of, men was organized and the
entire country in that section was ex
amined: aÂ«s clossly as tlie density of
the foliage would permit, but no trace
of. Henrietta was discovered.
One- of. the letters was addressed to
Henrietta.. This had been written by
his mother and In it was expressed sor
row that Henrietta and his brother had
parted. In another letter !t was dis
covered that the brother, Georg-e Hen
rietta*, was, in Montana., The letters
were taken* to~ the Coronet*** office.
Filcher has no theory concerning the
fate of Hepriet^ar* He "told the story
yesterday oh his return 'from Auburn.
Henrietta was unknown in Auburn.
The letters in- the basket indicated that
he formerly lived in Canada.
J. A. Filcher, commissioner to the
St. Louis Exposition, made a find while
visitins his old home at Auburn last
Saturday that -farms the foundation of
a mystery now receiving the attention
of the Sheriff and other peace officers
of Placer County. Mr. Filcher found
on a trail articles that point to the
disappearance of a man by the name
of Frederick Henrietta. This name was
found on letters in some clothing that,
together with a telescope basket, lay
on the trail. '

DEEMED BAD AS EPHESUS
SHERIFF ' INVESTIGATING
The tangled marital relations of Dr.
John A. Frits were the subject of adju
dication before Judge Cabaniss yester
day. Mrs. Jennie Fritz testified that
last October the defendant had threat
ened her life. She was hardly positive
enough regarding the language used in
the alleged threats. In addition she
said that her husband had invaded a
house of worship she was . attending
and hissed at her like a real stage vil
lain. The defendant on his own behalf
stated that he. had been induced .to
leave a wife and four children by the
present partner of his sorrows in order
to marry her. Within the last ten days
he has applied for a divorce in order to
reunite with the woman who was his
first helpmate and -who bore him four
children. The discarded, and regained
wife was present to inform the couVt
that she was willing to assume again
her marital relation with the physician.
The first wife conducts a drug store on
Corfland avenue. .
Judge Cabaniss warned both the,de
fendant and the ', complaining . witness
that hereafter their, trails ; in life must
never 'converge under the penalty. of
his severe displeasure. "Go back; to
your wife and four children," said the
Jons C. Madsrn. who is also known
as Fred Nelson, is opposed to long en
gagements and is also a disciple of the
doctrine of force. He is an ex-convict,
having been sent to San Quentin for
burglary committed in Fresno. For the
last three weeks he has made his abode
in the Winchester House, on Third
street.
During his excursions in search of
the satisfying hamburger with Java
his heart's attentions were attracted by
a pink-cheeked and pretty girl named
Anna Krumrn, who assists her father
and mother in conducting a restaurant
at the corner of Third and Stevenson
streets. Madsen concluded that she was
his affinity, and he wrote her two let
ters.-The first was rather profuse. In
it' he said that he believed in taking the
world by etorm. Then he asked her
what night she would go to the theater
with' him. The second letter was more
terse, but insistent. It said: "Dear
Annaâ What time can you marry me
to-morrow?" Miss Krum consulted Po
liceman Jack Tillman. who is the friend
of mankind on Third street. She said
that she could not. possibly have met
Madsen unless in the way of serving
him v/ith coffee and doughnuts, and she
knew of no reason why he should write
her that kind of letters. Tillman ar r
rested Mr.dsen for vagrancy and he
was tried before Judge Mogan yester
day. It did not appear to the court
that the defendant was thoroughly
well balanced mentally. "I think he's
got spinning wheels in his head," said
the Judge aside. "I'll continue this case
a few days. and let. the insanity sharks
try to probe the six days' bicycle race
that I think is going on under his hat."
Henry Jackson, a negro, nearly es
caped the strong arm of justice yes
terday because he possessed a bursrlar
proof nerve. The stunt came off in
Judge Mogan's court. Henry had been
arrested on the charge of purloining
a sold watch and a bankbook from
Mrs Julia A. Taylor, who conducts a
lodging-house at 25S Minna street. Pat
rick Kearney was arrested on the same
night by Policeman Cavanaugh on the
charge of vagrancy. The case of Kear
r.ev was called for adjudication and a
burly negro arose in the dock and was
let out. Cavanaugh called to the
stand and testified that Kearney was
not a bad fellow. The policeman said
that the accused was a nuisance on
Kearny street when he got drunk. In
view of the fact that the defendant
had been in jail for forty-eight hours
Judge Mogan dismissed him. The art
ful neÂ«?ro started on his way to free
dom.
"That isn't Kearney," whispered Cav
anaugh to the Judge as he noticed the
receding form of the colored man.
"Kearney is a big Irishman, and not a
coon." . . ,
"Bring that man back!" thundered
the Judge, and Bailiff Hickey laid his
strong arm on ihz artful negro.
A harried search of the records was
made ar.d it was found that the real
Kearney had defaulted his bail. Jack
son was haled before the bar again *.o
answer to the crime or theft. He ad
mitted that he had stolen a watch and
bankbook from Mrs. Taylor. He said
he hid the plunder under the stairs and
when he looked for it he found it was
gone. Judge Mogan told Jackson that
during the lonely hours he spent in his
cell before his appearance again . to
day he would better consult the shades
of his "African ancestors and find out
what became of the missing property,
otherwise the limit for petty larceny
would be coming to him.

"1 tried to carve a turkey myself in
my young and salad days," he said,
"and I know exactly how you felt. I
nearly committed manslaughter on a
long-necked waiter who was watching
the operation, and I made a saute of
the gravy bowl and the bunch of white
hyacinths in the center of the tabl*.
I'll take this case under advisement for
a day."
W. A. Adams started to carve a tur
key in his Valencia-street demesne on
Christmas day. He secured a half
Nelson on the breast of the bird with
the carving fork and felt for the place
where the joint of the wing should be
in properly reared turkeys. The bird
sliji out of the platter and landed in
the lap_of his wife, who was wearing
her best ;own. It was recovered and
Adams smiled* peacefully, while hi3
wife broke into tears. He concluded to
tackle a leg when he had resumed a
strangle hold on the holiday fowl.
Somehow the turkey was deformâ¬d in
that particular quarter and caromed
off again. It hit Mr. Adams' daughter
in her nicely braided hair and broke tho
glass in a beautiful etching. There was
gravy enough left on the etching to
turn it into an oil painting.
Adams again regained the bird and
searched for an opening through the
breast with his carving knife. His
language was something awful by thiy
time. The cook fled to the back yard
and buried her face in her apron. Hi3
wife and daughter withdrew to the
bedroom in tears. The turkey w.is
dressed by this time with Axminster
trimmings and plugged with glass.
Frightened neighbors rushed in,
thinking a tragedy was being commit
ted. Amons them was Mrs. Louis
Spencer, who lives at 1331 Valencia
street. She told Judge Mogan yester
day that on her entrance Adams hit her
on the head with a beer glass. Theo
dore v Ross of 1523 Sanchez street, also
invaded the premises, intent on pre
venting crime. He was also assaulted,
he claimed. J. Johnson, a next d'<or
neighbor of Adams, told the court that
he had also fallen a victim to Adam.V
wrath when he reached the dining
room in order to rescue a woman in
distress.
Altogether three charges of battery
were preferred, against Adams. The
turkey didn't appear against him. The
Judge was inclined to take a lenient
view of th? case.

Thomas Perdon. a diamond setter, is
known as "Jack the .Shouter." When
overcome with strong drink he displays
his fondness Jfor the fair sex by going
up to them afld shouting in their ears.
The entire neighborhood jh the vicinity
of his abiding place was alarmed at his
peculiar actions until Policeman . M.
Brady appeared and took him to tlio
City Prison. There are certain places
in the' prison where darkness and a
coating of redwood make a "shouter "
forget his vocation and Perdon spent a
night in the narrow confines of one of
these. He had lost his voice when he
appeared before Judge Mogan yester
day. The only explanation , he couid
make was that he was so drunk he did
not realize what he was do'.ng. His case
wascontinued until this morning in â¢)_â¢
(der that he might produce witness's
to prove his general good character.
Paul E. Barloy was held for assault
with a deadly weapon by Judge Fritz
yesterday. Ho is the wayfarer trvnn
Chicago who shot Charles Constantine
through the leg while the latter was
beating a woman at 36 Geary street.
Barloy deposited $750 in geld coin with
the clerk to insure his appearance be
fore the Superior Court- The Police
Court lawyers, who are unaccustomed
to clients with such a display of wealth,
clustered around him like bees around
a hive, begging for the privilege of de
fending him.. He laughed them oft and
will probably get along without their
help when the trial comes off.
Fred N. Gardner's birthday came on
Christmas And the two events were
too much for him. When he had re
ceived his full quota* of liquid presents
he stood on Market street at the Ninth
street crossing and walloped everybody
he could reach on the passing cars.
Policeman Pat Brady passed, in citi
zen's clothe3, hanging oh to an 'outside
rail and intent on getting home to bi<>
turkey dinner. Gardner caught him in
the ear. The policeman climbed .1 Â»wn
and found his assailant. He told Gard
ner he. was an officer and showed his
star. The defendant had a few swinss
left, however, and he gave the police
man a battle before he would submit to
being taken into custody. Judge Mo
gan found Gardner guilty of battery
and will mete out the proper punish
ment this morning. Gardner is a clerk.
John O. Burns imagined a vain thing
when he thought he could convict John
Vehy and Dan Shaugnessey of battery
before Judge Cabaniss yesterday.
Burns is a watchman for the Santa Fe
and was engaged on Christmas night
in guarding two carloads of turkeys.
He claimed- that other cars of fowls
had been tampered with during the
holiday season and he was especially
watchful on the night In question. He
found two men loitering on the tracks
and ordered them away under pain of
being made to look like pieces of Swiss
cheese from the holes he would bore
in V with his trusty gun. One of
the men "smoked his lamp" with a well
directed blow and' the- gun proposition
was forgotten in this moment of ex
citement. Vehy proved he was far from,
the scene where the watchman had his 1
mix-up and Shaugnessey- showed very
clearly that he was in no way aggres
sor in the conflict and Was not intent
on stealing fowl. Both men were dis
missed.
L. B. Whitney claims to be a com

traveler. $5*0 -on a check that was only
worth 4 cents a pound when weighed
on the scales of commercialism. There
was no money to meet the demand.it

continuance in order" that he might
communicate with friends resident
on the island called Manhattan. Judge
Cabaniss continued. the case for three
weeks, at which time Whitney believes
he will- bft able to secure funds suffi
cient to satisfy the claims of Doolittie.
The police say that Whitney has been
in difficulty before.
William C. French, ; president and
business agent of the Bridge and Struc
tural Iron Workers' Â¦ Union, who l was
arrested Saturday night on the charge
of felony embezzlement, set forth his
case before Judge Cabaniss yesterday
through his attorney. He was accused
of withholding $100 which the organiza
tion appropriated for the burial of
George Nottingham,- the footpad who
killed himself at 128 $Coe street. It
was shown that the constitution of the
order provided that the money should
be paid to the decedent, and French
claimed that ho really did not know
Nottingham's present address and had
no means of ascertaining how to for
ward the money to him. Under his
counsel's advice he had retained the
money pending proper disposal of it.
Prosecutor Hanley asked for a contin
uance until Wednesday and intimated
that there were other charges of irreg
ularities that would be preferred
against French by the union.

English statesmen are evidently exercising every pos
sible element of statecraft to find a way out of the diffi
culty into which their alliance with Japan has involved
them. It is not particularly gratifying to throw one's self
into a row for new found friends, but it, is a reasonably
safe wager, that England will find a way neither to of
fend Japan nor to harass Russia.

the use of which is an economical feature in the con

some quarters that a bond issue, adding to the interest

Among the most interested consumers
are those working for low salaries, as
shown by your reports, and many of
them have more than ordinary intelli

earthed that deprive them of food that
ought to be easily within their reach.
All churches and benevolent institu

The hip lock is of use at all times
and has many variations. But its
chief value occurs when your oppo
nent leads, especially if he is also
rushing you.
You can work the trick either on
the right or left side, according as ho
leads with right or left. The one grip
ii obtained in like manner with the
other, except that it is tried from op
posite sides and with opposite hands.
Let us suppose, for instance, that your
antagonist leads for you with his left.
Bring your head far enough to the
right to avoid his blow and step for
ward past him with the left foot.
Step far enough beyond him to allow
your left hip to come just behind his
left hip. As you step forward throw
your left arm around his waist and
bring up your right hand across your
body until it lies across his throat.
Now you are in position. Push for
ward simultaneously with both arms
And' bend the upper part of your body
forward, thus throwing him across
your left leg, your hip acting as a
lever. He must fall, and fall hard,
especitlly If you do the whole thing
too quickly to permit him to steady
himself by catching hold df , you.
Should a man try to work this "hip
lock" on you simply move your left
leg to the left far enough to prevent
him from stepping past you. This is
an absurdly simple guard for so clever
a trick, but it is absolutely effective.
Speaking of feet brings me to a
very dangerous trick in the street
fighter's scanty repertoire, namely,
the kick. If a tough gets a
chance to do so he will kick.
If his kick lands as he in
tends it to your share of the fight will
be at an end. Therefore do not allow
it to land. Be on the lookout for a
kick. When one is. aimed at you you
can do one of two things: First, jump
in, too close to him for the kick to
have any effect, and floor him while he
is on one foot and consequently, off
his balance; or jump back out of
reach and seizing his foot as it is ex
tended pull him over; or else, pulling
the foot upward with both hands you
car. whirl about, bringing the man's
whole body over your shoulders to the
ground by bending suddenly over and
drawingJhe imprisoned foot sharply
forward^"o do the latter a knowledge
of leverage is necessary. I will deal
v ith this question of leverage a little
further on. .
For the present let us go back to
the subject of the hip lock.
In a street fight, nine times out of
ten, your opponent will lead with his
right hand instead, of with his left.
The knowledge of this peculiarity
should give you a great advantage
over him. He will lead with the right
because to the average untrained man
the use of the right hand in striking
cftmes more, natural than does that of
the left. Be prepared then for a pre
ponderance of right-hand blows, and
study beforehand how best to block
and counter them.
The street fighter will usually (es
pecially if he be a workingman who
is strong but does not understand box
ing) strike downward from above in
preference to sending in a straight
blow. ' All you have to do, thus, is to
catch his blow with a high guard and
land on him wherever you please with
your other hand. Here is where a
knowledge of the straight counter
(described In the previous lesson)
should stand you in good stead.
He is also likely to be clumsy on his
feet, which will make your footwork
the easier and the more effective.

The extent to which our shipbuilding industry has
declined by reason of the sweeping of our merchant
marine from the deep seas may be estimated from the
statement in the report of the committee that the inves
tigation was undertaken "at a time when American
ship building is in a state of unprecedented stagnation,
when not a single new steamship has been contracted
for in an American shipyard for nearly three years."
The report goes on to say:
"We find that American vessels engaging in our ocean
trade are to-day compelled to meet a more serious and
a more destructive competition than ever before, largely
through the vast subsidies and bounties that foreign
Governments are now paying to their merchant ships.
We realize that the purposes for which these subsidies
and bounties are paid to their merchant ships by foreign
Governments are chiefly military in order that there shall
be available auxiliary cruisers, scouts, transports, col
liers, supply ships and such other vessels, with their
trained and experienced officers and men, as are essen
tial to the uses of the Government in time of war. And
we further realize that the unprecedentedly low, freight
rates resulting from these subsidies and bounties re
ceived by foreign merchant ships render successful and
profitable competition on the part of unprotected vessels
built in the United States and officered and manned by
our own citizens absolutely impossible."
Referring to President Roosevelt's recommendation
that the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of Com
merce and Labor and the Postmaster General be in
cluded in any commission Congress may authorize to
investigate ways and means for promoting pur merchant
marine, the committee recalls the interesting fact that
under the administration of Washington Congress asked
that Jefferson, who was then Secretary of State, prepare
a report on "the privileges and resTrictions of the com
merce of the United States." The report made by Jef
ferson at that, time is in many respects pertinent to the
situation to-day. Among other things he said:
"If particular nations grasp at undue shares of our
commerce, and more especially if they seize on the
means of the United States to convert them into aliment
for their own strength and withdraw them entirely from
the â¢ support of those to whom they belong, defensive
and protective measures become necessary on the part
of the nation whose maritime resources are thus in
vaded, or it will be disarmed of its defense; its produc
tions will be at the, mercy of the nation which has pos
sessed itself exclusively of the means of carrying them
and its policies will be influenced by those who com
mand its commerce. /If we lose the seamen and artists
whom it now employs we lose the present means of
marine defense and time will be requisite to raise up
pthers when disgrace and losses shall bring home to our
feelings the disgrace of having abandoned them."
Jefferson is renowned among men of his time as a far
sighted statesman. More clearly than any one else"of
high station he foresaw the coming greatness of the
Union and the difficulties that would perplex its people.
Rarely, however, was he more far-sighted than when he
wrote those words. Indeed they now appear almost like
a prophecy. Our commerce has been made to serve as
the support of the merchant marine of other nations
who have grasped at undue shares of commerce. We
have seen our country deprived of the merchant fleets
that should be rightly counted among its maritime de
fenses. The situation is such as to call for the imme
diate earnest attention of Congress , and the matter
should be taken up at the present session.
LAST June the Maritime Association of the port of
New York appointed a committee to investigate
the decline of American shipping in the foreign
, carrying trade of the country and to report upon the best
means of promoting the industry. The committee has
now submitted its report to the President and the facts
'disclosed show a condition of affairs that is by no means
creditable to either our patriotism or to our reputation
for business sagacity.
The facts disclosed by the investigation are briefly
summarized thus: "We find that despite the quadrupling
of our foreign commerce our tonnage under register has
declined from 2,496,894 tons in 1861 to 873,235 tons in
1902, and that while, American vessels carried 72.1 per
cent of our exports in 1861 they carried but 6.6 per cent
in 1902."

that I thought Schmitz would be re

" 'Do you think so?' he said.
" 'Why, I certainly do.'
" 'Well, there is a big coon down at

Crocker will be elected,' said the negro.
I told him to go and bet the $5 on
Schmitz; that it was a sure bet. 'Go
and bet him the ?5 and If you losa I
will make you a present of $5.' said I.
"The colored fellow left the booth

As one passes up the Mohawk Valley
upon the New York Central Railroad
he cannot well help noticing extensive
deposits of well-rounded pebbles and
gravel, rising from fifty to 100 feet
above the river and marking the glacial
floods which poured over from Lake
Ontario into the Mohawk Valley
through the low pass at Rcme, which is
only 200 feet above the lake. During
the period of this -overflow; into the
Mohawk Valley Lake Ontario was
greatly enlarged, and its shore line,
marked by a ridge of gravel and sand
thrown up by the waves, can ba traced
continuously from the Niagara' River
along the level of the " Rome outlet
through all the towns and (ities of Cen
tral New York. This ridge has been
known from the earliest settlement,
since it furnished a convenient location
for roads and building places. ' .
But before the ice had melted from
the Mohawk Valley there was an enor

over the higher passes leading into the

of drainage compelled to tarry off the
double portion of water annually fur
nished by the rainfall of the two drain
age basins, but they were charged with
several times this amount through the
final melting of the ice which had been
accumulating through many thousand
years. If the spring freshets of each
season are great, the spring freshet of
the glacial period must have been enor
mous, furnishing probably four or flvÂ»
times the anK-unt of water furnished
by the annual rainfall.
The terraces of the Connecticut River
have long been famous, consisting of
deposits of gravel nnd sand rising upon
either bank of the river from fifty to
100 feet cr more above present high

they exist as brick clays, extensively
v.orked Jn various places above NÂ«'V
York City, but spreading out into ex
tensive gravel deposits where the Hud-
Bon River comes out from the Adiron
dack Mountains. The sandy plains of
Saratoga were spread out during that
stage of the glacial period, while im
mense streams o? water were turned
over into the Hudson Valley through
Lake Champlain and Lake George. Thâ¢

But great as are the direct effects
upon the drainage of Ice of existing
glaciers those brought to light by study
of the glacial period in North America
eurpass them all in wonderful measure.
Naturally the accumulation of ice dur
ing the glacial period began at the
north, and early clogged up the great
lines of drainage^ which lead in that
direction, while after the ice had
reached its farthest limit and began to
melt back the northerly direction of
the drainage could not be resumed un,-"
til the ice had all melted away. Thus
for long reriods the drainage of the
great lakes, which now 'parses down
the St. Lawrence River, was turned
over to swell the volume of the Sus
quehanna and the Ohio rivers, while
all the drainage that now enters Hud
son Bay was turned over Into the val
ley of the Missouri and the Mississippi.
This, any one can see from a slight

has in some sections become N lhe terror of horticulture.
The enormous benefit of such work as Mr. Craw's is
seen by a glance at the statistics of our fruit export,
which during the last year has been a thousand carloads
A week. It is estimated that this season's orange export
will reach the high water mark of 36,000 carloads. For
weeks past the tonnage capacity of regular freight trains
out of the Northern California orange belt has been ex
ceeded, and special orange trains have been resorted to
to carry the fruit to~market. The land around the county
poorhousc of Butte County is planted to oranges and the
crop supports the poor of that county. The courthouse
park in Merced is planted to oranges and the crop this
year is 300 boxes. Think of what this means, not only by
way of showing our obligations to theentomologists and
the beneficial insects they have discovered and applied,
but as an evidence of our climate.
Eastern courthouses are surrounded by a few decidu
ous trees, which stand bleak and bare against the cold
winter sky at this season, while in California the statue
of Justice queens it over evergreen orange trees on which
the yellow fruit and the white blossoms for the next crop
appeal to the eye and the taste for the aroma of flowers.
Even the pauper in this State basks in the sun of Decem
ber, in the midst of orange trees laden with fruit, which
provide for him the comforts he requires, and relieve
the taxpayer of a burden which is borne by our climate
and the ladybird. The rest of the horticultural world
will come to California to learn how to fight bugs with
bugs, and .out of that knowledge the grasshopper, the
chinch bug and the Hessian fly, the weevil, and perhaps
the terrible boll worm that threatens to make cotton
growing impossible, will finally be overcome.
We got the San Jose sale from*China. It arrived be
fore we had our immigration laws against such aliens,
and was unfortunately named the San Jose scale, to the
injury of the good name of that splendid fruit region in
the Santa Clara valley. It is now nearly exterminated
here, thanks to another internal parasite and a ladybird
bearing the royal name of Rhizobius Toowoombae. The
San Jose scale was carried East, and as the use of bene
ficial insects is not as well understood there as here it
THE account of the insects beneficial to California
horticulture, written by Alexander Craw, and pub
lished in The Call, is the story of victory over the
minute enemies of the State's prosperity. Time, was
when insects', from grasshoppers down to the chinch bugs,
and still down in the scale of measurement," assailed
crops in the United States, the farmer and planter
folded his hands and lamented, borrowed money to .sub
stitute his Jost crop and waited for the pest to pass by.
The country owes to Horace Greeley and the New
York Tribune the first impulse to the study of ento
mology which is now making man the master of the
; petty enemies of his prosperity. The Tribune had for
! one of its most interesting writers Mrs. Tupper, widely
known as "the bee woman," whose studies of the bee
were the beginning of all our modern honey industry.
Out of them issued the Langstroth movable comb hive
and all of the beneficial devices which have taken the
place of the old haphazard way of robbing the bees and
leaving them to their own devices, without assistance
against their insect enemies and without protection
against famine.
Those studies in entomology turned attention* to the
ravages of our insect enemies/ as well as to the labor of
our insect friends, and now the Agricultural Department
in Washington has in Dr. Chittenden and its other, ento
mologists a skilled corps of, scientific men who devote
themselves to the study of every insect known in the
country, and California has in Mr. Craw a scientific in
sect quarantine officer, who stands guard over all im
ported trees, vines and fruits, to see that foreign insects
injurious to us are. kept out. He is the most important of
ail our foreign immigration agents, and the aliens he
excludes and to which he denies asylum are among the
most dangerous of immigrants.
To the subject of insects, harmful and beneficial, more
attention is given here than in any other State in the
Union. Here was first applied the discovery that there
were insects that feed upon and destroy the various
white, black tind purple scale insects that kill the orange,
olive and other fruit-producing trees. This discovery
has resulted in importing and breeding the various lady
bugs which have made our citrus crop safe. We have
learned the use of another kind of useful insect. The
ladybugs swarm upon scale covered" trees and keep up a
perpetual picnic, increasing as they go, until the orchard
is cleaned entirely. Then Mr. Craw found that we have
a minute insect, a native son of the Golden West, which
properly encouraged moves into the black scale, inhabits
it as a place of residence and proceeds to eat up its habi
tation and then moves with its increased family into
others. This little friend of ours does not increase fast
enough to entirely overtake the black scale, which out
breeds it, but it does destroy from one to three quarters
of the black scale every year, and the black ladybird
from Australia does the rest.
While the verdict was being recorded
he coolly walked out of the room and
went to his quarters, where he packed
his trunk and, after treating all of the
friends whom he met about the hotel,
took the fir3t river boat to San Fran
cisco and there took passage on a Pan
ama steamer for Central America. He
died there a few years ago.
In the meantime the Judge set a
day for judgment and when that time
arrived he ascended the bench and was
about to pass the sentence of the court
on the supposed prisoner, but there
was no prisoner. The Sheriff was called
upon, but that official stated that the
man was on bail and had not been
placed In his custody. The District At
torney was next Interrogated and he,
too, showed that no order had been
given by the court remanding the pris
oner into custody. A convicted mur
derer had simply walked away from
justice through the laxity of its officers.

was such that he was admitted to ball,
it being considered only a mere matter

ing from the Maumee into the Wabash
River about a mile wide, revealing an
abandoned river channel, which is still
almost as distinct as when the mighty
current of Niagara, increased by the
annual melting of the mountains of
ice. made this its course of exit to the
pea.
Before the ice had melted from Cen
tral New York the drainage of the
Great Lakes was held up to the level
of the passes from Lake Erie and Lake
Michigan, leading into the valley of
the Mississippi. At first, before the
Ice had melted from Northern
Michigan, where the lakes are united,
there were several independent out
lets. These can be easily traced from
Lake Chautauqua down Conewango
Creek into the valley of the Alleghany,
and down French Creek to a similar
destination, and from Grand River in
Ohio into the Mahoning at Warren,
reaching the Ohio, through Beaver
Creek, twenty-five miles below Pitts
burg. The Ohio River all the way
down is lined with gravel terraces, fre
quently rising more than 100 feet
above the" river, which furnish build
ing sites for the most of the cities
along its course. Fourth street, in Cin
cinnati, is on one of these terraces, 120
feet above the river.

ley are clearly seen at Harrisburg and
other places further down.
subject for congratulation and should appeal to Ameri
can pride, because this is the only nation on earth at this
moment that can reach into its surplus for the money
to pay for such a purpose. Besides this it is clearly
possible that the treasury will be equal to the task of
supplying the money for construction of the canal as the
work progresses. What more forcible object lesson for
the world could be given expository of our resources
and our power than this?
Another fact equally gratifying is that this money, re
leased from the treasury to pay Panama and the French
company, will remain with us, because of the large bal
ance of trade in our favor and against Europe. The
money will simply be turned over to the agents of the
recipients and become a large transaction in interna
tional exchange, and our own money is used to pay the
balance Europe owes\us in trade. This is another fea
ture which could exist now. in no other country. It
comes as near as possible to eating our cake and keep
ing it.
American patriotism is inspired by the appearance of
such possibilities, at a time so favorable for the in
crease of our prestige. Other nations are girding and
belting for destructive war, and are making overtures
for loans in the bourses, to be spent in destruction,
while we reach into our own pockets for the many mill
ions which will begin construction of a work for the
benefit of every nation and the use of the peace promot
ing commerce of all the world. It is one of the con
spicuous triumphs of republican-democratic institu
tions, and will long stand in history to the honor of an i
American President and his administration. j

Remove Wasons From Streets.
By order of the Board of Public
Works thirty-six wagons were re
moved from Main, Beale and Spear
streets Sunday and conveyed to the
city corporation yards, where they will
be held until the owners pay the ex
pense of their moving. The manufac
turing and business houses have been
warned repeatedly by the Board of
Public Works to cease using the city
streets as wagon repositories and have
ignored the orders. It is the intention
of the board to see that the city ordi
nances relating to the blocking of
streets are enforced. Among the firms
that werÂ«Â» guilty of this practice and
whose wagons were removed are the
Judson Manufacturing. Company and
Henry B. Schindler's wagon factory.

The question agitating the minds of
many members of the department Is
what will the Commissioners do in re
gard to Captain Dunlevy?
The Police Commissioners at their
meeting to-night will take up the mat
ter of filing the vacancy caused by the
death of Captain Birdsall. The pro
gramme was mapped out to place Cap
tain Dunlevy on the retired list at the
regular quarterly meeting of the Pen
sion Board and assign Lieutenant
Duke to fill the vacancy, as 'he is fa
miliar with the district. This would
enable the board to assign Lieutenant
Burnett to take charge of the Central
district.
The only drawback to the carrying
out of the programme is the desire of
Captain Dunle\~/ not to be retired for
another three months for pri%*ate rea
sons. This question will be settled at
to-night's meeting. If the Commis
sioners decide to grant Dunlevy's re
quest Duke will have to be assigned to
the Central district, with which he is
unfamiliar, and at the end of three
months Burnett would be assigned to
the harbor district, with which he is
unfamiliar.
Police Commissioners Will Take Defi
nite Action on the Matter at To-
Nijrfifs Mentis.

Dr. Donald McLean was taken to
the City Prison yesterday by Detec
tives O'Dea and Mulcahy and will be
booked on a charge of grand larceny.
He is accused of having stolen several
instruments, valued at 5250, from a
physician at 8 Mason street, with
whom he was employed as an assist
ant. The instruments were recovered
by the detectives.
McLean claims to be a graduate of
the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.
He came here some years ago, got
married and was divorced. He has
been a slave to the liquor habit and
has not been in active practice for
some years. The physician ?at 8 Mason
street took pity upon him and gave
him employment. McLean, it is al
leged, broke open the cases contain
ing the instruments and sold them.
Dr. Donald McLean Is Accused in
Complaint of Stealing Instruments
From His Employer.
Chinese Laborers returning to the
United States from Hawaii or the*
Philippines will be treated by the Chi

Hongkong or any other foreign port.
Such is the substance of a decision
transmitted to United States Immigra
tion Commissioner Hart North by
James R. Garneld, acting Secretary of
the Department of Commerce and La
bor.
The decision was rendered in the
matter of Cheng Fong, a laborer who
obtained a certificate of residence at
Fresno in this State. He shipped on
the United States steamer Pathfinder
on October 12, 1901, for the voyage
to Manila and return and therefore
did not obtain a return certificate. At
his own request he was discharged at
Manila, where he remained for some
time. He arrived here on the Logan
on November 14 and was denied a
landing on the ground that the Phil
ippines were foreign territory so far
as the operation of the Chinese ex
clusion act was concerned.

The recent benefit performances at
the Grand Opera-house in aid of the
widows' and orphans' fund of the
Fire Department resulted in a profit of
510,000 to the worthy cause. With the
private subscriptions, including one of
$5000 from Claus Spreckels. the firemen
now have more than $15,000 in their
treasury.
With the tickets sold by the firemen
and the cash taken in at the doors of
the opera-house, the gross receipts cf
the week amounted to 515,000. The ex
penses of renting the theater and pay
ing the company that appeared there,
together with the cost of putting the
famous fire scenes, totaled up to a little
more than $5000, leaving a handsome
balance for the widows' and orphans'
fund.
Chief Sullivan and Assistant Chief
Dougherty and all the men of the Fir-Â»
Department feel deeply gratified at the
support given to the benefit by the
general public.
Assistant Chief Dougherty personally
supervised the staging of the famous
fire scenes and Dominick R. Conniff of
the Fire Commissioners' office super
vised the business end of the week's
benefit.
The desire to witness the thrilling
work of th<Â» firemen, as presented on
the Grand Opera-house stage was so
great that it would have been possible
to continue the fire scenes for a second .
week.
The firemen, however, feel that th3
public has responded so generously
that when the second annual benefit is
given the citizens will- again give
hearty support to the cause of tho3Â»
left behind by the men of the depart
ment who risk their lives in fighting
fire and saving life.
The firemen do not depend upon the
public entirely to help the funds of the
widows' and orphans' fund. The men
contribute $1 each a month out of their
pay in addition to their contributions
to the sick benefit fund which they
maintain.
The officials of the Widows' and Or
phans' Aid Association of the Fire De
partment are:
President, J. W. Reilly: vice presi
dent, Charles Murray, engineer, of en
gine No. 2; directors, Frank Cummings,
driver truck No. 2; E. A. McKittrick,
battalion chief; Captain James Rad
ford, captain engine No. 25; E. I.
Church, Commissioner's office; James
McGowan, engine No. 28; John Doher
ty, captain engine No. 17, and D. R.
Conniff, Fire Commissioners' office,
treasurer and secretary.
The ordinance provides for the man
ner of the sale of the bonds, which are
to bear interest at the rate of- 3& per
cent per annum, payable semi-an
nually. Accounts shall be kept of th?
funds created for the redemption of the
bonds and the payment of the interest
thereon, for which a special tax shall
be levied at the same time that the
general tax levy is fixed.
Any purchaser of the coupon bonds
may avail himself of the privilege of
exchanging the same for registered
bonds as provided for in an act of the
Legislature entitled "An act in relation
to municipal bonds," approved Feb
ruary 28, 1903, the provisions of which
are made applicable to tile bonds pro
vided by the ordinance.
While provision is made for the is
suance of 29,778 bonds, it is not intend
ed to sell them all at once, but only in
such amounts as are- needed to carry
out the improvements.
The Mayor's veto of the ordinance
taking from him the appointment of
the position of poundmaster, now held
by H. O. Irwln, and placing the power
in the board's hands, was ordered
printed for one day and referred to the
joint Committee on Finance, Police and
License and Orders, from which it Â¦em
anated. The clerk of the board was
directed to furnish each Supervisor
with a copy of the transcript of testi
mony in the hearing of charges
brought against Poundmaster Irwin.
The resignation of John S. Banner
man, assistant clerk of the Board of
Supervisors, was accepted and Super
visor Loughery, whose term expires on
January 8, 1U04, was elected to fill the
vacancy. The appointment of Lough
ery is to take effect January 9. Ban
nerman, who was a faithful clerk, re
signs to take up the practice of law.
The position pays a salary of 5125 per
month and Loughery, who was thus
honored by his colleagues, Is in every
way fitted fqr it.
The Boar.d of Supervisors yesterday
passed to print a proposed ordinance
providing for the issuance, sale and re
demption of several bonds in the a.q
aggregate amount of 51",771;000, for
which the people voted at a recent elec
tion, for the purpose of constructing
new schoolhouses, a hospital and sewer
system, repairing accepted streets, con
structing a new county jail and a pub
lic library and acquiring lands for pub
lic parks and children's playgrounds.
Resolved, further, that said commission be
and is hereby requested and directed to furnish
a list Fhowlnir the numes, salaries and posi
tions of all temporary appointees who are
subject to the civil service provisions of the
charter. In each of the departments in the
city government, as certified December 1, 1003.
Braunhart said that the resolution
was preliminary to another he would
introduce at a later date directing that
civil service examinations be held im
mediately ft>r the positions not now in
cluded in the merit system.
"It seems to be- the opinion of the
people and of the members of this
board," said Braunhart, "that sufficient
time has elapsed since the charter went
into effect for the holding of all the
examinations for positions in the vari
ous city departments. I believe that the
proposed bond issue ;w r ould not have
been successful at the polls if the peo
ple had not been under the impression
that the expenditure of the money
would be carried out under civil ser
vice regulations."
The board postponed action for one
week on the proposed ordinance pro
hibiting the operation of the com
pressed air carpet and house cleaning
machines on public streets, to give the
opponents of the measure an opportu
nity to be heard.
City Attorney Lane filed an opinion
that it is within the power of the board
to regulate the' operation of such ma
chines on the public streets by the
passage of the ordinance, but the
clause "this ordinance shall not affect
engines or machinery used in the pros
ecution of public work" would render
the measure invalid. Lane holds there
is no power in the board to permit such
engines when used for one class of
work and prohibit them as to other
classes of work. The ordinance would
only be legal if made applicable to all
engines operated by motive power upon
any sidewalk or public street, Lane
says.
Resolved, That the Board of Civil Service
Commissioners be and It is hereby requested and
directed to inform this board what examinations
have been held for eligible^ in the public serv
ice in accordance with the provisions of arti
cle XIII of the charter, other than for pro
motions In the Police and Fire departni|nts, for
the calendar year begtnning January^, lUOi;
and
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
began preliminary proceedings toward
a proposed Investigation into the al
leged slowness of the Civil Service Com
mission in holding examinations. The
Supervisors adopted, under suspension
of the rules, the following resolution,
introduced by Supervisor Braunhart:
Grades were ordered established on
Potrero avenue. Central avenue, Go
deus street and Waller street.
The roadway of Fourteenth street,
between Noe and Sanchez, was condi
tionally accepted.
The ordinance granting the Asso
ciated Oil Company permission to lay a
pipe line from a point on Berry street,
between Sixth and Seventh, to Sixth
street, to Townsend and to the storage
tank of the San Francisco Gas Com
pany- was passed to print, with the
amendment that the pipe line be laid
on the northerly side of Townsend
street.
Kruttschnitt also filed a memoran
dum of property owned and controlled
by the Southern Pacific Company front
ing on the northeasterly side of Fourth
street southerly from Channel street,*
and fronting on the easterly side of
Kentucky street. Commencing at Chan
nel street the property includes blocks
43, 44. 4r,, 47, 418, 417, 41C. 415. 414, 413. 412,
also the southerly 250 feet, of Mock 406
and the northerly 200 feet of block 405.
The company will file deeds to the strip
of land ten feet wide to be taken from
the blocks named to widen Fourth and
Kentucky streets, this being another
condition under which the franchise
was granted.
City Attorney Lane advised the
Board of Park Commissioners that the
market place lots bounded by Channel,
Hooper, Irwin. Fifth and Hudson
streets are under the jurisdiction of the
Board of Supervisors and are scheduled
among the city and county properties.
The Park Commission held that the
lots had been reserved for park pur
poses and the Board of Supervisors had
no right to lease them to the Southern
Pacific Company for terminal purposes
in connection with the new bay shore
franchise.
Julius Kruttschnitt, general manager
and fourth vice president of the com
pany, filed a communication with the
board, in which he states that the ap
praisement made by City Engineer
Grunsky of damages aggregating $75,
000 to property in the district affected
by the proposed changes of street grades
along the line of the bay shore route is
acceptable to the company, which will
pay to the property holders the
amounts respectively awarded to them.
The company will also bear the ex
pense of putting each of the improved
streets affected into a like condition of
improvement at the proposed new ele
vations. Written agreements to that
effect will be filed with the board im
mediately. Attorney Kierce, represent
ing several property holders, asked if
the stipulation to improve the. streets
applied to t!fr sidewalks. City Engineer
Grunsky said that it did, and to this
Jere Burke, attorney for the company,
assented. .â,
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
finally passed the ordinance granting
to the Southern Pacific Company a
fifty-year franchise to operate a steam
railroad along the bay shore as a "cut
off" line. The vote on final passage was
unanimous.
Supervisor Wil?on also conducted a
personal investigation on his own ac
count and found that Po-me of the ma
chines had been used for the entire
quarter and the owners were cited con
tinually by the Police Commission for
failing to take the machines out. The
ordinance authorizing the refund of the
licences will come up for final passage
next Monday, but will be withdrawn
to permit the Finance Committee to
investigate further before allowing the
claims, which Supervisor Wilson says
will be materially reduced.
The proposed investigation in the al
leged excessive demands of J. J. Doyle
tor $2000 for ten horses and 52475 for
nine horses purcha^-d by the Fire De
partment was not held at yesterday's
meeting of the Board of Supervisors
owing to the fact that none of the Fire
Commissioners had seen lit to heed the
Invitation of the board to be present
and give testimony regarding the pur
chase of the horses. Braunhart called
attention to the fact that horses had
been purchased last year for 5165 each,
and he desired to have it explained
why the price had been raised to $300.
Braurt" art wanted subpenas issued for
the Fire Commissioners- and other wit
nesses, but It was decided to request
their presence at the next meeting,
when the matter will be fully threshed
out.
As a preliminary to the fixing ot^rates
to be charged for lighting during the
next fiscal year the board adopted a
resolution directing: the chief of the
Department of Electricity to furnish
the board not later than January 5,
1904, with a list of all persons, com
panies and corporations engaged in the
business of supplying heat, light and
power to this city or its inhabitants.
"The 'money' machines are prohib
ited; the '.hunter card' machines are
not. They are not designat/>d by the
petitioners^ and neither the Police De
partment r*iÂ»r the license office can ver
ify the claims as being 'money' ma
chines."
Expert Cyril Williams yesterday filed
a report with the Supervisors* Finance
Committee in the matter of the petition
of slot machine owners for the refund
of licenses paid for the quarter ending
October 1. 1902, on the plea that the
machines had been ordered out by the
Police Commission before the expira
tion of the quarter. Williams says in
liis report that the amount paid on 422
machines was $4220. and claims aggre
gating $4550 for the return of the
licenses have been filed. The report
concludes:

MEASUREMENTS OF LADS.
"I have no excuses to offer," said the
champion yesterday. My condition is
perfect. I fee! strong* and will be able
to go the route at a fast clip. If Han
lon straightens up and fights me the
battle will be a short one. He will find
a different man in front of him this
time. When I fought Hanlon before I
vÂ»as woefully out of condition. Even
at that I stayed twenty rounds. The
very next month I went against Mc-
Govern, and people who saw me battle
with Hanlon and Terry ought to know
how good I am when fit. My wind is
good, my hands are in fine shape and
I really believe I am punching harder
than ever. Hanlon is a god, boy, but
1 think I have him sized up and can
beat him.. My money is up and I am
ready to back myself to the extent of
$S000. I have had little trouble making
the weight and will weigh in to-morrow
n'pht all right." ,
Corbett was a pound overweight
when he arose yesterday morning and
he took to the road to rid himself
of the superfluous weight. Accom
panied by Billy Otts and his "kid"
brother he ran down the ocean boule
vard, filling his lungs with ozone and
feeling as chipper as a lark.
Corbett did light gymnasium work
in the afternoon and enjoyed a swim
in the surf. He was in high spirits and
certain of victory.
The betting on the contest is 10 to 6,
with Hanlon on the short end. Both
men are in perfect condition and a ter
rific battle is anticipated. The sale
of seats for the contest is very larse
and a big attendance is expected.
"I have trained Young Corbttt nine
teen months for championship battles
and I pledge you my word I have never

so much to condition the little feather

ST. LOUIS, Dec. 28.â Captain P. J
Carmody. general manager of the new
St. Louis Jockey Club, which proposes
to fight the Western Jockey Ciub next
season in this city, to-day received
from Jacob Holtman, one of the best
known starters In America, an accept
ance of the Cnion Jockey Club's offer
to pay lloltman $30 a day, aix days a
week, for seven months, to start at thi
new St. Louis track.
Carmody reserves the right to farm
out Holtman's services when he does
not need them for his own racetrack,
the contract which Holtman has signed
being similar in many respects to those
usually made for crack jockeys.
Holtman is now starting at the Cali
fornia tracks. He is conceded to be
one of the best starters In th-= business.
Undoubtedly he will be outlawed by
the Western Jockey Club for allying
himself with Carmody, but as Holtman
does not intend to do- any more start
ing after next season outlawry has no
terrors for him.

Jack Monroe, the heavyweight pu

Champion Jeffries, arrived in town
last' night. He was visiting relatives
in Butte, Mont., and came down to
see the Hanlon-Corbett mill. Monroe
renewed old acquaintances.. He once
played football here as a member of
the Olympic and Reliance club elev
ens and also trained Jack-Moffatt and
"Philadelphia" Jack O'Brien for con
tests. Monroe has been matched by
Harry Pollock, his manager, to fight
Tom Sharkey. Sharkey. declines to
fight here. The contest will probably
be brought off m Boston, where fif

For a time the Southern Pacific
Company ran aN. day train , tHrough
irom Chico. but this was taken off the
route several months ago. Later the
company promised thai? the service
would be resumed on December 1, and
failing to get it. the indignation of the
townsmen was aroused and they fin
ally sent Nichols to this city to ask the
Southern Pacific officials why they
were not shown more consideration.
Nichols v.-as given assurance yester
day that the grievance of the northern
1-eople would be promptly investigated.
In presenting the matter to Good
man Nichols stated that if the com
pany could not rearrange its time
schedule the people would be con
tented if it would leave a sleeper on
the siding so that people bound for
San Francisco could retire to the coach
early and be picked up by the through
train when it arrives after midnight.

The last vestige of the original Little
Neck clams will disappear if the United
States Government decides to jxrant the
petition of a number of wealthy men
who own summer rss'denres on tha
shores of Little Neck Day.
These mei> are iireparing a ottition
which is to be forwarded tu Congress
man Scudder, requesting: that an ap
propriation be granted Dy the United
States Government^ for the dredging
and Improvement of Little Keck Bay.
N'o improvements of this character
have ever been made in this- body of
water. This has been due io the fact
that no*^request has ever been made to
the. Government that it giv?^any at
tention to the bay. There was a very
good reason for this recieence on the
part of the residents and land owners
in the vicinity of the bay.
It wag in Little Neck Bay ihat the
< . icinal clam of that* ram? was se
cured. Immense beds covered the bot
tom of the bay. Thr-se beds have all
but disappeared, owing to persistent
working and dredging of thÂ£ bay by
the clammers and the action of the
tides in washing into the bay the dirt
and refuse from the many towns along
trie shores of Long Island Sojnd. so
that the clams that were not taken
were killed. The business of clamming,
v.hich eight or ten years agi supported
whole communities in th:s vicinity, has
disappeared. There is therefore no
reason now why the bay should not be
improved.
The work of the tides has fo fi!!ed
in the bay that at the present time
yachts of any draught can make land
ings only at high tide. In th<; summer
time the bay is dotted with these craft,
for nearly every resident has at least
one boat of considerable size. For that
reason there is a desire for the im

T-he part of "Jinny" Austin, whose
jealousy has earned for her Mr. Fitch's
apt title, is not devoid or opportunities.
Mrs. Austin is discovert-d taking leave
of her bridesmaids and parents in the
opening act and becomes je&lous even
at the auspicious moment of one of her
bridesmaids, it' is in the family. Papa
is jealous of "Jinny's" confidences with
mamma. Brother is jealous of sister's
newly aco.uircd husband. And so on.
Ths husband, John Austin, is an hon
est, fine, if somewhat thick-headed per
son, and wholly in love with his wife.
Mr. Fitch had here good material to
his hand. Given a logical and original
complication the play might have been
developed upon thoroughly interesting
lines. But the playwright denies the
possibility of sympathy with either the
husband or the wife and uses the
weather-beaten incident of the crime
of the wife's brother with the hus
band's shielding of him to bring a>bout
his catastrophe. The wife is jealous,
r.ot unreasonably, but stupidly. The
husband expects an equally impossible
faith through his ambiguous perform
ances. The play ends in n suitably
banal fashion with (he lady turning on
the gas and the family breaking down
the door to rpscue her.
Mrs. Bloodgcod seems to havo made
a portrait of the green-eyed lady suf
ficiently vital to dominate the weak
ness of the play. Miss Ida Conquest
has not yet arrived there. However,
Miss Conquest appeared to greater ad
vantage than she has before done here.
To her gracile charm she last night
added a variety and depth of emotion
hitherto un!ooked for. In the comedy
she was, however, distinctly happier,
but showed throughout a fine sincerity
and intelligence.

An Apollo Belvedere and a pianola
are star a'ctor3 in Clyde Fitch's latest
play. "The Girl With the Green Eyes,"
presented for the first time here last
night at the Columbia Theater. Possi
bly the play may have carried some
I kind of conviction with Mrs. Clara
Bloodgood, who created and played the
part until last week, in the name role.
Charming as is Miss Conquest, who
made her third appearance as the "girl
with the ereen eyes" last night, she
fails of the power to disguise the lean
ness of Mr. Fitch's material. This Mrs.
Bloodgood must have had to persuade
to the acceptance of the play, as the
charm of Kthel Barryrnore begilded
even "Captain Jinks." Still, Miss Con
quest's essay was a distinctly plucky
affair. She arrived from New York
in Salt Lake City on Friday last, played
the part without rehearsal on Friday
and Saturday evenings, arrived here at
1 o'clock yesterday, had her -first re
hearsal at 2 o'clock and last evening
appeared in the Western metropolis
with no small success.

NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Mildred Sehuitz, the English bred
mare owned by Hugh Wilson of Butte,
no longer belongs to the "Oregon short
liners." She dispossessed all firm be
lievers of that idea at Ingleside yester
day by her ridiculous win of the seven
furlong selection, fifth to be rendered.
In the ring there was no more demand
for her than there Is for carrots at a
Sixth street market on St. Patrick's
day, for from 5 the odds went to 16 and
20. Bell rode the Wilson entry and when
Silent Water had done with shaping up
the pace, Mildred Schuitz picked up the
running and won switching her tail
and pricking her ears, four lengths
ahead of Pierce J., an uncorking, with
Tommy Burns in the saddle. Jane Hol
ly, the six and a half furlong record
holder, and an 8 to 5 favorite, formed
one of the select company, dropping
in behind the winners.
Favorites made a stand-off of it, cap
luring, three of the purses run for. The
attendance was right up to the s-tund
urd and the betting or!Â«k. bin not )Â».ir
ticularly heavy.
There .were no apo'.rtjr'C-S Lo make for
Cardwellton, which went to the post fa
vorite for the opening Futurity course
sprint. Otis had him in front stepping

ning third. Nonle came out after a long
rest and, heavily played at i\<> to 1,
was beaten a nose by Optimo, another
good thing piloted by Tommy Burns.
Garnet Ferguson's colt The Mighty,
at odds of 13 to 20, took the two-year
old race. Telephone was the contender

SAN DIEGO. Dec. 28.â P. A. Ed
wards, a carpenter, was found dead in
his room in a lodging-house here to
day. The body, fully clothed, was
lying on the bed. In the right hand
was a revolver from which a bullet
had been fired into the left temple.
It is believed the man committed sui
cide through despondency.
The unauthenticity of the telegram
could have been established had the
rourt at Rennes appreciated the im-
I>ortance of the error. Finally it de
veloped that in the telecram where
the words "Co canaille de D â " appear
the Initial ''D" had been substituted
for the letter "I*." The original copy,
written by M. Oribelln. the keeper of
the archives of.%he War Office, carried
the letter "P." The scratching upon
th^ paper was apparent,, but M. Der
iiilon. the handwriting expert, testified
that the letter "D" was correct. It is
row claimed that he was in error.
PARIS. Dec. 28.â The grounds upon
which Dreyfus depends for vindication
and restoration to the army have been
communicated to the Associated Press.
Dreyfus charges that a telegram from
Colonel Schwartzkoppen, the late Ger
man military attache here, to Colonel :
I'anizzardi, formerly Italian military
attache at Paris, as presented to the
court-martial at Rennes, bore the date
at April, 1834, when he was occupied
v.ith the details of mobilization of
troops of which the. telpgram treated,
whereas the actual date of the tele
gram was the last of March, lbljj, aft
er he (Dreyfus) had been tried. 'A
copy has been found and has estab
lished the correctness of Dreyfus' claim,
in the opinion of the commission which
recommended a revision of the case.
The statement of the case against
Dreyfus, containing the telegram when
it arrived at the Ministry of' War, was
dated ADril 1. 1S95. which Dreyfus
tlaims thows the telegram was Â¦writ
ten in the latter part of March of that
year. With a pair of scissors the late
<"olonÂ«M Henry clipped on* a corner of
the telegram, and thus the actual date
disappeared. Then Colonel Henry in
his own hand annotated the telegram
April. 1W4. The colonel, however, neg
lected to remember that the month of
April had only thirty days, for in the
document th<-re is a mention of the 31et
or the current month.

house is neaFly two miles from the

PHOENIX. Ariz., Dec. 28.â Because
Secretary Horace Harrison of the Live

hours of extra work this evening in his
office In the Territorial- Capitol build
ing is the only reason the offices of that
structure were not gutted by fire be
fore midnight. As It. Is, the furnace
room is charred and the build in/; has
been. damaged by smoke to. the extent
of several hundred dollars.
It could not have burned to the point
of a structural ruin, as It is practically
a fireproof building, with the exception
of finishings and furnishings, the
frame being of steel and th'eâ walls of
granite and tufa. But had the fire not
been discovered till ten minutes later
it is likely that many valuable docu
ments would have been destroyed.

Rush has found what Is believed to be
the wreck of the lost .steamer Discov
ery. Near Indian Island the hull was
located with the bow- out of the water,
but no name was found which would
indicate positively fhat the wreck was
that of the Discovery. ; ,.' : V*V:
The vessel found is about 100 feet In
length, with a winch visible, but posi
tive marks of Identification are want-
Ing. So sure is Agerit Butterfleld of
the Chlopeek Fish Company, however,
that the Discovery was found that he
offered to return en the Rush from
Juneau to complete proof. The officers
of the cutter consider It possible that
the Â¦ wreck discovered Is that of the
steamer Rainier, which was lost <jn
Sasskalg Island, seventy -miles distant
from the hulk now found. Photo
graphs of the wreck brought to Sitka
indicate that the hull Is that of the
Discovery.
When the finding of the. DiscoVery
was reported by an.. Indian, from the
Cross Sound- the Rush
steamed there and made a hurried in
spection of the region. Last week^she
returned to Sitka where her officers
desired to spend Christmas.-,'- John

REDDING, Dec. 28.â John C. Lyle.
a miner, "who hag gone under the name
of Quinn, shot and killed Frank Sav
age, a popular miner, near Carrville,' in
Trinity County, Saturday afternoon. in
a quarrel over, a trade. A few minutes
before he had threatened 'to shoot Jim
"Wright, a miner, because Wright at
first declined a proffered drink.
To escape certain lynching Lyle, who
has always been unpopular, was rushed
by officers to the Trinity County. Jail
at Weaverville. where he is now either
insane or acting the part of- a maniac.
Savage, the man killed, and James
ITrsher were traveling in a buggy be
hind two horses over the road .from
Trinity Center to .Carrville when they
met Lyle on foot. â¢ This was a short
distance from where Lyle had threat
ened to shoot Wright for declining, the
drink of whisky offered from Lyle's
flask. - , '
Lyle carried a roll of blankets on his
back and a shotgun on his shoulder.
A trade was struck- in which^ Savage
was to give a watch and a small sum
of money for Lyle's shotgun. The dis
cussion of the. trade was friendly when
Ursher drove on to the borne of James
Gillette, distant one hundred yards, to
borrow the money for Savage. When
TJrsher returned Lyle Â¦ was in the act
of raising his shotgun to hl3 shoulder..
He fired, sending a charge of large
shot through Savage's body and caus
ing Instant death. â¢ -.
Lyle then swung the weapon on
TTrsher, threatening to kill' him, too.
Ursher jumped behind a tre-e and Lyle
passed on. He was captured two hours
later without a show of resistance by
Deputy Sheriff Bert Bassham. On ac
count of high feeling over th- tragedy,
caused jointly by its cold blnodedness
and tho -popularity- of the dead man
and the unpopularity of the slayer, the
officer hurried him to Weaverville. Just
what occurred between Savage and
Lyle during Ursher's brief 'absence is
not known. Lyle refuses to make a
statement.
It is allege "at Colonel Evans Ioe^
J1H0O at rou!e. a few nights ago at
a eingle sitting and was compelled to
give notts to Frcure payment of the
money to the gamblers, and the charges
against the treasury agent are based
on this gxeen-cloth transaction.
Evans has* been in the service thirty
years and has heretofore been consid
ered a man of exemplary habits. He
incurred tha enmity of several Federal
officials here owing to his searching in
vestigations into Onvornmon: affairs
and it is eaid that somo of these caused
the charges to be filed.

SALINAS. Dec. 28.â A surprising
burglary took place here last evening
and when the perpetrators were cap
tured they proved to be two "boys, Sid
ney Ross, aged 12 years, and Harold
Ross, aged 8. _
H. H. Mason, a stationer and fancy
goods dealer, does not keep his estab
lishment open on Sundays. This fact
was known to the boys, who some time
during the afternoon went down the
alley in the rear of the store and broke
a window in a small addition. Harold
crawled In and opened the back door,
allowing Sidney to enter. They then
broke a window In the store and en
tered. â¢
From the cash register they obtained
$18. They then helped themselves .to
pocket knives, pencils and harmonicas,
and departed as they had entered, un
observed.
The mother missed the boys and re
ported to Sheriff Nesbitt. who had Just
been informed of the robbery. He found
the youngsters on a passenger train
about 10 o'clock at night with tickets
for San Jose. The stolen property was
found on them and they confessed.
They were barefoot at the time they
were caught. They confessed also to
having committed two other burglaries
during the past fortnight. They* will
probably be sent to the Whlttier Re
form School. :?...
The change in rates will take effect
on January IS. The agreement to this
effect was "made some weeks ago and
the various freight agents were noti
fied of the contemplated change.. The
lines* in the combine to advance rates
arevthe O. R. and N.. Union Pacific,
Southern . Pacific, Northern Pacific,
Great Northern and Santa Fe. The in
creased rates will be charged on all
shipments from New Ytfrk and com
mon ' points, Chicago and common
points, Omaha and Missouri River
points and from the St. Louis terri
tory. In fact, everything brought to
the Pacific coast from the district be
tween the Missouri River and the At
lantic coast will cost about 10 cents
more per hundred pounds. On some
articles the advance amounts to as
much as 25 cents.
The new rate covers carload -lots in
most instances and mixed shipments
cannot be made even at the advanced
rate. A comparison of the old and new
rates on some of the principal articles
shews something of what the extra ex
pense is going to be. The Increase of
agricultural implements per 100 pounds
from all Missouri River and Eastern
points is 10 cents; jars and glasses, old
rate S5 cents, new rate $1 10; drugs,
carload lots, old rate $1 25. new rate
$1 40; plate glass, old rate $1 25. new
rate ?1 50; building material and steel
and Iron structural'material, old rate
75 cents,. new rate 85 cents.
The announcement that the 10 per
cent raise will go. Into effect
18 will no doubt cause a great activity
in shipping from the East between now
and then. Those who have large or
ders in the Eastern markets will en
deavor to get their material delivered
before the rate goes Into effect. ,
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 23.â The
transcontinental \ lines and Western
roads - have prepared the schedule for
the advance in freight rates to the ex
tent of t more than 10 per cent. The
announcement has caused some con
sternation here. The advance will af
fect'almost every commodity shipped
from the East and the whole coast
from British Columbia to- Southern Cal
ifornia will be affected by the raise.

NORTH GERMAN LLOYD'S
FAMOUS TRAINING SHIP
HERZOGIN CECILIE.
Considerable interest has been mani
fested in the German bark Herzogin
Cecilie. now due here from Newcastle,
England. She is bringing merchandise
for the Iota! market, but it is not the
cargo that marks the vessel as some
thins different from the scores of other
windjammers that blow In and out of
tUe Golden Gate. The Herzogin Cecile
is owned by the North German Lloyd
Steamship Company and is used by
them as a school for training officers
for the company's big passenger steam
ships. On the voyage that should now
be approaching an end the ship carries
about sixty cadets. Some of these are
first voyagers, others are almost ready
to be transferred to one of the fast
liners for the completion of their nauti
cal education and the commencement
of their professional career.
Tho cadevs are carefully selected in
the first place and their education is
in the hands of a corps of competent
instructors. As the Herzogin Cecilie
engages in ocean freight carrying, the
same as any other merchantman, go
ing wherever the best freights offer and
carrying cargoes according to the will
of the charterer, the horizc-n of cadet
life is wide and the opportunity for
learning the business part of sea life
almost without limit.
The Herzogin Cecilis has not been in
San Francisco, but last year visit9d
Portland, Or., where the German col
ony showered the cadets with atten
tion. During her stay at Portland nore
than 25,000 people visited the schcrol
Â»=hin. She is a four-masted bark of
ZH2 tons register and was built in 1902
at Bremerhaven. She is commanded
by Captain Warneeke and as she 13 a
very fast' sailer is due here any day.

"Ylang-ylang exports have shown
marked increase and give promise of
substantial growth in the future as one
of the rising products of tht; Philip
pines. It is reported to be an almost
certain crop and to yield a profit as
hish as $5 a tree a month."
"Sugar and tobacco have shown sub
stantial increases, but the exhortations
of cigars and cigarettes have shown a
considerable decline.
"The increase of exports for-the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1903. over the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1902, is $12,517,241â
a most gratifying showing, all circum
stances considered.
"Hemp (as commercially called, but
technically 'Manila fiber') mav well be
ranked, as king of exports from the
Philippine Islands, as it nmounts in
value to about two-thirds of the entire
exports! Hemp exports have 3hown a
steady Increase during the last four
years, the value for the fiscal year end
ing June 30. 1903. being an increase of
$5,860,259 over the, fiscal year ending
June 30, 1902.
"The copra industry, too, has shown
a most remarkable increase of more
than' 200 per cent over ih* previous
year.
"The above products of the Philip
pines were exported to fifty-one coun
tries, of which more than one-half went
to the United States and England.
"The United States rises 'from the
second to first place, leading England
to the extent of $5,063,730, whoreas for
the previous year England led the
United States to the extent of $40S,733.
"Excluding sold and silver coin
France stands third in the list of coun
tries to which exports wore made,
Japan fourth and Hongkong fifth.
"The abnormal exports of Mexican
silver coin >to Hongkong .give- that
place a prominence in the list which
it would not otherwise occupy.

"Th<"- appellant alleges that there was
rv> chart ta!Â»le on the Iaqua. and in lieu
thereof he made use of his berth. This
should be remedied by the owners of
that steamer, and of all other steam

"As I lind that the appellant, whose

"During the trial in the lower court
it was Eboxrn by the log of the Iaqua,
as well as by the evidence of the aj)
l>iieant, that there had been no fire or
boat drill en that vessel while under
command of the appellant, as required
by law. for more than two months prior
To th^ disaster. It was mainly for that
reason that the lower court revoked his
license. There was no other course left

ed when li'-r-nses to officers were issued
for 'W year only, and should have

brought about by the authorization of

thereafter for five years.

There was continued firmness In strictly fan
cy offerings of Burbank Potatoes, but common
and inferior offerings showed no improvement
and such stock was steadily accumulating.
Three car3 of choice Sweets came In and prices
were higher, as receipts are expected to be light
during the rest ot the week. Onions were firm,
at unchanged rateÂ«. â¢
Los Angeles vegetables arrived freely and as
the demand was nothing extra prices of several
descriptions were lower. Tomatoes were the
most plentiful and they were very weak at
sharply reduced price*. A. considerable portion
of the receipts were soft and overripe and had
to be disposed of quickly. Green Peppers were
still in excessive supply and prices had a. fur
ther decline. Mushrooms were firmer under
limited supplies.

NEW YORK, Dec. 2Vâ Beginning in a
. somewhat irregular and uncertain way, to
ll day's etock market gained strength and breadth
and made a comprehensive advance in price.
A react!.?.* on proflt-takins la the last hour
was followed by a. recovery and a firm closing,
although prices were not at the be?t all
around. The movement during the early part
of the day was not very convincing owing to
the cnaracttr of the stocks which made the
most r.rtl!;ant movements, meet of them being
rarely seen in a conspicuous place In the
market and the wid* movements j n thP , r
prices t^ing affected on a light volume of deal

United States Express. New York Airbrake
RÂ«*lty preferred. North American, Colorado
Fuel and some of the stocks of minor rail
roads were among those which moved upward
from a to 10 iKMnt.". This failed at nrst to
overcome the position of the rext of the market
f-aused by the threatening outlook In the Far

while the Stock Exchange was closed Th4
market turned definitely upward, when the an

KÂ£Ef-tiients brought the toial for the day up to
Sl.iOU.O'J". and this *u the persisting Influence
in lifting price* of the more prominent stocks
and overcoming the doubts caused by the bank
statement. The loan expansion v.as generally
attributed to corxwratlon borrowing and wai
MippoÂ»"d to be the forerunner of new issues
of tecurltles, *uch a* the $40,000,000 of Lake
J-here bonds offered for sale. The offering

waÂ» interpreted as *Â«pressing the opinion of
the banking community that the 4 per cent

Mail reports from New York say that Coast
holders of Prunes have recently turned very
firm, and are turning down Eastern bids

CHICAGO. Dec. 28. â The wheat market
opened strong to-day and for a time prices con
tinued to advance on a erood demand from
commission houses, local bills and shorts.
Reasons for the advance were various. The
one most frequently mentioned at the start
wp.s the possibility of war between Russia and
Japan. Something of more immediate influ
ence, however, was a report from Argentina
that heavy rain was again prevailing in the
wheat districts, and that harvesting was be
ing delayed. Foreign markets showed gains
as a result of these advices, and' the higher
prices abroad were largely responsible for the
strength here. After opening V*c to Vic higher
at K)%c to S4',sC, May advanced steadily to
S4TÂ»c. an advance of 1 cent from the low
point. Liberal selling by longs and some
by shorts resulted in an easier tone. General
selling set In during the last half hour on a
rumor that tlie big bull operator was unloading
and much *of the advance was lost. A firm
undertone, however, prevailed at the close,
and final figures on May were at 84ViÂ®%c.
Corn was firm at the opening, due to higher
cables and light receipts. The market in
creased In strength throughout the session,
with onlv small offerings. The close was
strong, with May at 45^0.
Oats were firm with local shorts doing con
siderable covering. The close was strong at
37
With hogs selling- at 10c advance and grains
all acting strong, shorts in provisions deemed
it wise to cover, and their efforts in this di
rection caused a strong opening. There was
good busing for investment account, and prices
were well maintained, despite im;jortant~ sell
ing In the way of profit-taking. The close
was strong, with May pork 12ttc higher, lard
up Vic and ribs were 5c ttfgher.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

WELCOMES TEACHERS.
Every seat was occupied when Wil
liam H. Langdon, the popular Super
intendent of Common Schools of the
city and county of San Francisco, called
the convention to order. His address
was a formal welcome to the visiting
teachers on behalf o-f the local School
Department. It was a vigorous speech
and was listened to with deep interest by
the big as-emblage. In part he spoke
as follows:
Schoolteachers from every county in
this State crowded the Alhambra The
ater yesterday in response to the call
for the annual institute of the San
Francisco city and county teachers and
the California Teachers' Association.
The latest in winter Â«o\vns and milli
nery was displayed by the- fair peda
gogues. The fair sex predominated at
the gathering.
Members of the local School Depart
ment tendered a reception to the visit
ing teachers last evening in the maple
and marble rooms of the Palace Hotel.
The two rooms were brilliantly lighted
and decorated for the occasion. The
guests were received by members of
ViÂ«itins Peilnenjrucs Gneats of Honor
at Function in Palace Hotel.
RECEPTION* TO TEACHERS.
C. H. Xeilsen reported for the com
mittee on "What Will Be Done With
the Teachers' Institute?" He state;!
that owing to lack of time it had been
found impossible to obtain a consensus
of opinion of members of the committee
and asked for further time. A commit
tee of five will accordingly be appoint
ed to report back next year.
The report of the committee on tho
preparation of teachers for State nor
mal schools for the work of public
schools, which was first on the list, will
not be ready until to-morrow morning
and in its place Superintendent J. W.
McClymonds of Alameda County gave
an interesting address on "The System
in Use in California Cities for Promo:
ing Pupils."
The rooms in the Mission High School
are very tastily decorated, particularly
the gymnasium, in which is a special
display of the work of students in the
Polytechnic and oth^r schools.
Professor E. P. Cubberley, while rep
resenting the majority, agreed with
Professor Jenkins on many of the sal
ient points. He disagreed, howevir,
with Professor Jenkins on the point
that members of the faculties of uni
versities might be adjudged competent
to select certain men as instructors in
specifie.d branches.
scribed collegiate course than that he
should be permitted to practice law or
medicine under the same conditions.
"Tho ; true* tÂ«Â»st of friendship Is that
we feel that the friend is truly another
self; that we prefer the other, the
friend to the self.- There is no test for
love except of the complete preference
of 'Â¦ the other to self. -So the feeling of
kin is everywhere. The world's history
is written in the growth of the feeling
of kinship."
The speaker then illustrated at length
by story, precept *.nd . example how
human beings have a feeling of kin to
dumb^animals. to flowers and to each
other. His address abounded in quaint
anecdote, poetry and. wit, and was
greatly enjoyed. It was the- first ad
dress of its kind., and the teachers are
counting on the, other. addresses to be
up to its standard.*: ""
; Another session will be held this aft
ernoon. Mr. Tompkins is scheduled to
speak again and he is assured of a
pleasant reception, because he has won
the hearts of the school teachers of this
State." The. association will hold a busi
ness-meeting and elect officers for the
ensuing year. - -
When President Erlowine had con
cluded fifty bors from the Clement
Grammar School, ranging in age from
7 to 10 years and taught by Miss Nelly
F. Sullivan and AJiss Esther Simms,
sang wonderfully well together. Their
voices blended beautifully and their
singing was appreciated. Miss Carpen
ter led the youngsters. The first song
sung was "The Star-Spangled Banner.'"
As the youthful voices rendered the
national anthem every person in the
hall rose and remained standing until
the patriotic melody was 'concluded.
The youths also rendered "Believe Me
if All Those Endearing* Young Charms."
by Moore, and English's "Drink to Me
Only With Thine Eyes."
Arnold Tompkins. president of the
Chicago Normal School, was introduced
and. delivered a splendid, address on
"Altruism as a Law of Education." It
was a diversiljed talk and aroused a
great deal of enthusiasm. Mr. Tomp
kins discussed marriage, language, bot
any, arithmetic, reading and, writing.
The speaker's facetious remarks, deliv
ered dryly, created a great deal of
laughter. .
"True altruism," he said, "is found
in the term motherhood. A mother
does "forget herself in the child.
This is not fiction or poetry, it is. a
reality. There is no hardship too great
for a to. endure for her child.
Motherhood is a great word, because it
is an idealization of altruism.
it was with the fear that T would find the
labors somewhat Irksonle, but I am p"(easÂ»ed t<j
state that such has not been the case; will-
Ing hands to assist were extended from every
direction, and with' their assistance the work
has not been only easy but pleasant. - .
And now we hope and beljeve that we have
prepared a programme to present that will
prove second to none in the history of this
association.
In concluding my remarks . I - will r say that
.when I accepted the honorable position as
president of this association,- one year* ago.
Such a reduction would Increase tho trtfvel
to our meetincs to such an extent that - tho
Tallroads would ' receive more for fares . than
they do at present rates;' therefore* I do not
consider that such a request would be unrea
sonable. â¢ , , , . Â¦ .". r. . . . '
â¢ There seems to be some good reason to be
lieve that many teachers lack-In their* ability
to do the very -beat work for the schools be
cause they are too local In their personal observ
ations and personal knowledge of what ' the
world affords and of what Is going on out
tÂ»!de of a very small circle extending but little
beyond the schoolroom and the horn*:, .' j
In most 'cases, however, this is not the fault
of â *uch teachers, but is the result of affairs
beyond thetr * control. The salaries they > re
ceive, are but little Â«mor*- than -sufficient â¢ to
support them with the absolute ' necessities o!
lite; and It matters not-how strong their de
sires may, be to acquaint themselves Â¦ person
ally Â» with the educational and other features
of our State. It is* beyond thei* power to do t,o.
:I have been informed that the schoolteachers
of one of-our States, feeling -.th* .necessity; of
this opportunity to Improve themselves .and
become better prepared for the work- of teach
ing, have '. obtained a very liberal - reduction
In railroad 'fares to travel at any time to any
part of that State. '. Â¦"Â¦â¢.''"
Â¦Such a privilege, to l the * schoolteachers of
any State i would mean ;. much, to .the. benefit
<Tf Â»the Â¦ schools â¢ of â¢ that Â¦ State. ' It ' would give
to ..them >a I much : broader field in ' which . to
become personally acquainted with the manage-'
merit, methods, and results In. the work: of^ the
schools. "Not only would they profit' by observ,
ing â¢ the work.' al the schools, but also by- be
coming acquainted with all the other features
and. affairs. at., their --State, - of - which,- -in- my
opinion. ; every schoolteacher should have seme
personal -knowledge. . -: â¢ . :
After, a. tour of t Imitations and inspections
of this kind such teacher* would return to
their schoolrooms Inspired with- new life, .new
thought.-- new methods, "and in . many .ways
better prepared for their work.
.As a step-in this direction I would recom
mend, that the executive committee of this as
sociation, bf requested to ' do all in - its -power
to -*ecure . from the railroads a one cent per
milu fare to the teachers of' this State to at
tend tho annual meetings of this association.
Should such a fare be obtained, I am satis
fied that there would he. five time* the num
bet attend these meetings that are attending
them now. This would give our associa
tion the means , to supply the ways to make
these annual meetings great educational feasts
that would be within the reach of every teach
er in this State. - .
The, people of " California have 'always 'Â¦ been
fairly generous In the support of our â¢common
schools, and have, a right to expect much of
them, but not the. very best without a more
liberal .support, , ,Â¦Â¦ ,
PEOPLE ARE GENEROUS.
The character and ability of the men and
women who will be called upon to manage
the affairs of this country In the near future
depend largely upon, the schoolteachers of to
day. Therefore it becomes our duty to, strive
by, all possible means to raise the standard
of our proficiency to the very highest degree
possible. â¢ . . . . .
The highest proficiency In the art of teaching
cannot be obtained in a few years of prepara
tion or a few years of experience in .teaching:
it is necessary as well that one should keep in
touch with th9 many sources of valuable in
formation tha,t are continually being developed
along the lines of progress. There Is no time
when we can afford to sit down .and fold our
firma with the thought that "we have acquired
all the knowledge and skill that is necessary
for the great work that Is before us. Â¦ - .
'â¢. After all. In connection jvith the work of our
common >chools, do we not find that as the
teacher is so Is the school?
. It .matters not so 'much* what the'eourse of
study may be, what the textbooks may be,
what the principal or superintendent may be;
if the teacher is good the school Is good, if
the teacher is bad the school Is bad. .
Perhaps by far the most valuable service
that can he rendered to our schools is,' that by
boards of* education and boards-of trustees in
electing good. ' competent teachers and- paying
sufflcitht salaries 'to retain them in the work
To knowingly elect an Incompetent or Indif
ferent teacher to whom a class of helpless, in
nocent children are year after -year assigned
and whose welfare suffers thereby can hardly
be considered le.Â«s than a crime.
The teachers fresh from the normal school or
the university can often profit by this sort of
information as well as the teacher of less op
portunities from the rural districts. ' â¢
Some of the most valuable knowledge we gain
is from those who Beldom If ever appear before
our meetings as Instructors, but are generously
distributing among the members valuable In
formation, gathered from the fields of their la
bors, which Is often far reaching In its effect
for good.
Teachers' county Institutes, district and State
meetings are. in my opinion, very valuable in
many ways to those engaged In the work of our
common schools. They bring about that sort of
information to the main body of teachers that
could hardly be obtained In any other way.
While these Is much to be learned at these
meetings from set lectures and the presenta
tion of special methods, there is also much In.
formation gained from the conversations pnd
discuwions that are continually going on anrong
the members. Â»
Its objects are to Improve the educational In
terest c-f the Stale by assisting those who are
engaged In the work to become more proficient,
and to give efficiency to our school system by
encouraging needed legislation.
ciation, and we believe that we have many rea
sons to feel proud of the work it has accom
plished during its entire existence.
The membership of this association is com
posed of those who are engaged In the work of
the public and private schools of this State and
others who are especially interested in the
cause of education.

PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS.
Some one has said that the hand that 1 rocks
the cradle rules the world. .*I believe, that- if
we, . have control of the education of, the youth
of 'our country we need not fear who govern
its destinies. As I said before, we must have
the bent material and then I believe 'that laws
fhould be framed a^. to make It-compul

aÂ£. AVe make laws for the protection; of -the
\flTak against the: aggressions of the ' strong,
and we make laws for the apprehension and
punishment of criminals, but' there is an -old
saying that an ounce of Is: worth
a pound of cure, and the greatest prevention
to crime Is education. I believe that;on*qur
public sehool'syste-mâ on the standard that we
make for Itâ will depend the. future '..welfare
of our country and the : citizens* of .SaniFran

BELIEVES IX
I firmly believe that we should find the best
material and when we do -â¢ find it, in the
teachers, we should . do everything Jin our
power to uphold them in their good work and
also to make provision for thenj In the future,
after their-time iÂ» past â when they, are In
capable of' managing and educating our chil
dren. And .herr In San Francisco our-teach
ers are very much interested at the present
time In a proposition to provide for the^utnre
and have asked that a monthly allowance # he
set aside in order to provide a fund to be used
for that' ourpose. ,1 say to you to-day, ladies
and gentlemen, that -the Board of Education
of Â£an Francisco has been and Is in sympathy
with the movement, and I Intend ; to Â¦ do â¢ all
I can with' the Board of Supervisors : to hav*
them provide In the next budget in order to
establish this fund. (Applause.) â¢â¢Â¦Â¦:.
Upon me has fallen a most pleasant task
and duty 3nd one that I do not underestimate.
As the chief magistrate of San Francisco and
on tjchalf of our citizens I extend a welcome
to this great representative gathering of edu
cators. Our able, amiable and generous Su
perintendent of SchooTs has In his address left
me troor, indeed. He has taken away 100,000
welcomes. <l,auzhter). Hut I want to say
that the welcome that lies In the hearts of
every one of the citizens qf San Francisco Is
not measured liy numbers, but is extended to
you to the fullest extent. (Applause.)
â¢ I have, during my short term of * office,
tried to do everything to build up the.' public
echool system of San Francisco and I ever
will be p.n ardÂ«nt advocate, of. our " public
school 'system. (Applause.) . . .
Toadies and Gentlemen and Members of the
California Teachers* Association:
Superintendent Langdon paid. a high
tribute to Mavcr Eugene E. Schmitz,
who, he said, had ever been interested
in public school education and a' good
friend to the teachers of San Francisco.
He then introduced the city's chief ex
ecutive, and when the applause, had
subsided the Mayor spoke as follows: 7
At the conclusion of the opening ad
dress Superintendent Langdon an
nounced a chorus from the eighth

Department, under the direction of
Miss Estelle Carpenter, supervisor of
music. Miss Fannie E. Bliven was the
accompanist. The curtain arose, dis
playing the bright faces of more than
100 children. At a signal the little boys
and girls marched, company . front, to
the footjights. and the teachers ap
plauded heartily. Miss Carpenter was
given a pleasant greeting as she took
her place on the rostrum. .The singing
of the youngsters was the feature of
the day. Their fresh young voices were
in perfect tune and they filled the the
ater with melody. Three songs were
rendered. The first was Gounod's
"Praise Ye i the Father," after which
they sang: "Calmly Sleep," by Schu
mann, and Brinkworth's "Birds' Valse."
The children sang so beautifully that
the teachers clamored for more," but
the length of the programme would not
permit ah encore.

There is a strong impression among
well-informed Republican politicians
that Victor H. Metcalf will be in the
field as a candidate for United States
Senator long before Senator Perkins'
term expires. It is now ciearly under
stood that if the programme to elect
Mr. Metcalf chairman of thÂ» Repub
lican State Convention had prevailed
at Sacramento Dr. Pardee would not
have been nominated for Governor and
Mr. Perkins would not have been re
elected to the Senate. Sever".', power
ful influences which were invoked. to
assist Metcalf's candidacy for chair
man of the convention are ready to
sustain him in a campaign for the Sen
atorship. In the gossip touching the
Senatorphip the point is raised that
Perkins dwells in Alameda County and
therefore it would not be right or
proper to give that county two United
States Senators. San Mateo, a smaller
county than Alameda. was once the
dwelling place of two United States
Senators â Charles N. Felton and Le
1-ind Stanford. Many polfticians hold
that the question of residence ought
not to be raised, provided the aspirant
is a known resident of the State. Down
in Ventura k is said that Henry Ox
nard. who is frequently mentioned as
a.n aspirant for the Senatorfchlp, Is a
bona fide registered resident of Cali
fornia, but business engagen-ents else
where have intervened to deny him the
opportunity of exercising the right of
suffrage in Ventura County.
There is a deal of conjecture con
cerning candidates for tho United
States Senate. Word comes from the
south that U. 6, Grant Jr. would like
to be President Roosevelt"? running
mate in the next campaign. The San
Diego statesman may not express his
views on th" Senatorship until the Re
publican national convention nominates
a candidate for Vice President. Sen
ator Bard's attitude in regard to the
Scnatorrhip is not understood by the
members of the Legislature who
brought about his election. Senator
Rowell hears that Mr. Bard will not
er.gage in a contest for re-election un
less-requested to do so by a majority
of the members of the next Legislature
frofn Southern California.
METCALF IX THE FIELD.
Th<re will be another Tinted States
Marshal, another United States District
Attorney and also a number of assifl-
Jng attorneys to be appointed. No
doubt Alam<vJa County, represented by
Senator Perkins and Victor H. Metcalf.
will ask for the office of Marshal, as
well as for that of Judpe. There is talk
along the line that Senator Bard, rein
forced by Repre5entatives Gillette.
Needham and Daniels, will insist on an
equal division of the new patronage. It
is said that Alameda will get every
thing created if Bard. Gillette and
Daniels exhibit *the slightest sign of
weakening. Senator Perkins is now
said to be insisting on the appoint
ment of W. C. Flalston to the position
of Naval Officer, contrary to the wishes
of Senator Bard and against the de
sires of a majority of the Republican
Representatives of the California dele
gation.
The salary of the Judge of the new
district will doubtless be fixed at $CMQ
per annum, the same as John J. de
Haven. District Judjre of the Northern
District of California, receives. It is
P"*->ip in political camps that Fred S.
s-'tratton v. ill resicn from the office of
Collector of the Port of San Francisco
to accept the Judgeship >â¢'' the new dis
trict. The salary attaching to the of
fice of Collector of Customs at this port
is JTOOft per annum, or $1000 a year
more than a Federal District Judge re
ceives, but the fact is always consid
ered that a Federal Judge holds for life,
whereas the ordinary term of a Federal
officer in other departments is only
four years. Rum^>r goes that George
Hatton or W. B. Hamilton will be ap
pointed to succeed Collector Stratton.

Stones come from Washington. D. C,
to the effect that there will soon be an
increase in the supply of Federal loavos

Congressional delegation have soundol
their associates in tho Senate and

Several minor attachments were en
tered yesterday at the Sheriffs office
against the fr?n of Sproat Eros., on
which several fteavy attachments were
levied last Saturday. All of the claims
entered yesterday were for labor. Theyj
are as follows: J. N. Albright. $1S: Jl
Kohn. $18; C. -Mvarado. $14; E. Ho
chette, *1S; S. fthine, $15; J. J. Hall.
$18; I* I* Armstrong, $18: A. Constini,
$15; A. I.. Partington. $14; C. Prindle.
$15: J. K. Pralle, $15; L. Goldman, $20;
R. B. Orr. $1.1.
At a meeting of the creditors of tho
Sproat brothers, which was held yes
terday at the rooms of the San Fran
cisco Board of Trade, it was decided
that the concern should not be allowed
to continue in business on payment of
any percentage of the claims against
them no matter how large an offer may
be made., This conclusion was an
nounced Sit the close of the meeting
by William Cluff, chairman of the as
sembled creditors. Mr. Cluff named a
committee of seven of the principal
creditors of the Sproat brothers, wUt"4
will meet to-day and determine upon
a definite course of action and take
the preliminary steps to have the con
cern wound up.
â¢â¢We have determined," said William
Cluff last evening, "that Spioat Bros,
shall not be permitted -, to continue.
This conclusion has bejn reached as
a matter of justice to the trado in
genera!. I say for the creditors that
there are only two ways that will suit
us. We must have a bill of tale of the
business from the Sproats or else we
will rroceed at once against them in
insolvency in the courts. Neither of
the Sproats was present at our meeting
to-day, although they were Invited to
be present for we wished to ask them,
some questions. We do not yet know
the full amount of the indebtedness."
There was a rumor yesterday that
Samuel Sproat had left tov-n. Last
evening this was demea and it was
said that ho was ill. The creditors were
of the opinion that neither of the
Sproats would disappear. ThÂ« meet-
Ins of the creditors yesterday was
characterized by warm remarks, show
ing that they were angry.
