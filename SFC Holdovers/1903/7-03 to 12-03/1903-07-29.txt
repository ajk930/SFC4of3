when they turned all the free men

had taken the direction of Lotus.
After much delay an organiza

all proceeded to Lotus and claim
to have tracked, the convicts to

Guard McDonald of Folsom,
who is in this vicinity with^eleyen

escaped prisoners are jj trying to
get into the country north of
Greenwood, some sections of
which are admirably suited, for
hiding and defense purposes.
Posses are now in pursuit of
the men and the residents of
Greenwood have* been warned of
the direction taken by the con
victs and it is reported from there
that a defense party, will be or

accurate reports of the doings! of

After breaking from the prison
the convicts and their captives
went as far as Pilot Hill, and
there a desperate battle was
fought shortly after 5 o'clock. The
convicts lost one of their number
and all their food and the wagon
in which they were traveling.
They would have been shot to
pieces at that time by the marks
men in the posse, but they were
protected by the gathering night.
Under cover of darkness the
convicts, with five guards and two
civilians as "human targets," pro
ceeded into the dense brush that
exists between Pilot Hill and the
south fork of the American
River. The posses were gathered
at Pilot Hill for a few hours' rest,
while bands of determined . men
watched the river bank for the
approach of the desperadoes. The
wait was not a long one, and at
daylight this morning the chase
was renewed, with but one deter
mination on the part of the of
ficers of the law â to wipe out of
existence the human bloodhounds
who had fought their way to free
dom by staining already befouled
hands with the life blood of a
brave officer of the law.
The return of Guard Klenzen

was hailed with delight by their
brother officers at Folsom prison.
From the lips of these two men
the first authentic news was
learned of the dread happenings
of the past twenty-four hours that
have startled the entire county.
The machinery of the law is once

it will not be long till justice will

any of the desperadoes are free or alive.
It waa in pursuance of these instruc
tions that the conductor of an inbound
freight train notified the Oakland police
at 2:30 o'clock this morning that a gang
of suspicious men were on his train and
that he would like to have a squad of po
lice meet the train at the Sixteenth-street
station. Captain of Police Petersen de
tailed eight men under Sergeant Green,
and at 3:30 o'clock they attacked the train
in force.
With drawn pistola the bluecoats de
scended on a freight car where the sus
pects were supposed to be hidden. Out
of the darkness they drafted three men.
but the trio were not fugitive convicts,
only a lot of perambulating "hoboes."

ford was arrested here to-day by Post
office inspectors on the charge of using the
mails in a scheme to defraud, as a result
of an Investigation of land swindles that
have been In progress since last Decem
ber. The investigation has been pursued
in Colorado, Michigan. Pennsylvania,
Missouri, West Virginia, North Carolina,
Tennessee and Texas.
Bradford's arrest resulted from, com*

was fixed at $2000. but up to a late hour
to-night he had failed to give bond.

WHEELING, W. Va., July 28.â But for
the timely arrival of policemen John Pos

have been strung up by an enraged mob
on Wheeling- Island to-night. Postecs,
who was drunk, caught in his arms and
embraced a well known and respected
woman residing on the island as she was
returning home over the bridge. The wo
man's ciles were quickly answered by
citizens who rushed from their homes.
The man ran, pursued by a crowd which
was growing every minute.
When the mob drew close to the for
eigner, he turned and drew a dirk and
held the mob at bay for a time. A stone
was thrown, knocking the knife trom his
hand and another struck him on the head
and knocked him down. A rope was sent
for by the enraged citizens. Vengeance
had been decided upon and a tree picked
out when a force of policemen arrived
upon the scene and rescued the man from,
the mob. He was badly used up and is
in a serious condition.

menced the convicts tried to make the guards get ir^ front of them to act as shields.
I crouched in the bottom of the wagon, but the convicts kicked me pretty hard and
tried to make me get up. I feel sure that Allison is the convict who was killed in
the fight at Pilot Hill. ' He was shot in the body,' and when he realized that he
was mortally wounded he cried out to the rest of the convicts : 'Well, boys, it is
all up with me. Here goes.' Then he placed a revolver to his head and fired," and
he blew almost the top of his head off. Klenzendorf says that it was Murphy who
was killed, but I am sure it was Allisqn, as I knew him well by sight. -
"While the firing was continued from the sides of the road the convicts made
General Overseer McDonough wave his white handkerchief as a sign of truce, and
after a while the posses stopped 'firing on the wagon. As the cdnvicts jumped from
the wagon the posses started firing again, killing one of the horses and wounding
the other three. The convicts realized then they would have to go ahead foot.
They grabbed the guards ,and held on to them wifti one hand, and each held his
rifle with the other. They all threatened us with instant death if we tried to get
away from them and" join'. the posses.
"The men of the posses must have recognized us, as they knew when to fire.-

GUARD SEAVEY TELLS OF THE PILOT BILL FIGHT.
The convicts started to march up the road, with the guards as their prisoners. We
got into the brush and then it grew very dark. We would go for a little distance
and then stop, and then go on again, then rest; and this went on for more than an
hour and a half.
"Finally, at half-past 9 at night, the convicts held a council as to what was
the best thing to do. Convicts Woods, Theron and Eldridge said the game was
up, and the best thing to do was to let us go and for the prisoners to scatter.
Seavis, the colored convict, was not satisfied with this and demanded that all the
guards be killed first. Finally the better counsel of the majority prevailed, and
Woods, Theron and Eldridge took their rifles and disappeared in the brush. The
rest of them would not allow Seavis to shoot, and it was about 10 o'clock last night
that they told us to get out of their camp and get away.
"We did' not waste any time, but struck the road and stumbled along on the
road we had come over. We rested for a time and then as soon as it commenced
to get daylight we hurried as best we could for the hotel at Pilot Hill. We met
some of the posses coming along the vroad, but we soon convinced them who we
were, and we finally reachejd the hotel. We walked about six miles in the night
back. to the hotel.
"What became of the convicts after we left themlast night we do not know.
Their guns were damaged' and many of them were useless, as they had used the
wrong ammunition, and the weapons; had jammed. They have no food with
them, unless they have secured some this morning. The country up there is very

"In all probability the company now
with the posses will soon be dismissed,"
General Stone said yesterday, "for the
men in charge of the campaign against
the outlaws have discovered that it is
simply an ordinary man hunt on a. large
scale and that the troops would do more
harm than good. The Sheriffs and the
men under their command know the coun
try well, while the soldiers would soon
get lost in the wilderness and their mili
tary skill would be utterly worthless in
a case of this sort."
GREAT excitement prevailed for a
while yesterday at the National
Guard headquarters at the Grand
Hotel. Adjutant General Stone was at his
post early, expecting news every moment
from the troops which had been ordered
out to pursue the fleeing outlaws at Fol
som. From the nature of the dispatches
received it was soon apparent that the
soldiers could do but little in the way of
taking up the trail.
About noon General Stone received a
dispatch from Nevada City stating that
the company ordered from that place had
been dismissed, as telegrams from the
Sheriffs conveyed the intelligence that the
posses could handle the chase better than
the troops and that the services of the
latter were not needed.

SCENE OP THE TERRIBLE CON
FLICT THAT OCCURRED AT FOL
SOM PRISON AND A PROMINENT
OFFICIAL WHO PARTICIPATED
IN THE FIGHT.
The supposition that Gordon was
wounded at Mormon Island bridge was
discussed to-day when his red shirt and
other clothes were brought into the pris
on. Gordon stripped off 'his red shirt
just before the convicts arrived at the
bridge in order not to attract special at
tention to himself. The number 5345 is on
the shirt and there are many blood stains
on It. The shirt, like all the others aban
doned by the convicts, is ripped right
down the front. The convicts took no
chances of being taken at a disadvantage
by the guards they held prisoners by re
moving their shirts by the usual method
of pulling them over the'ir heads. No word
has been received from the prison posses
to-day by the Warden and the informa
tion gathered here has been secured by
t^lcfihone from points near the scene of
action in El Dorado County.
Late to-night a message was received
from Pilot Hill from Captain Swisler, who
is in command of the National Guard.
He said that the convicts were reported
to have doubled on their tracks from
Granite Hill and to have recrossed the
American River.
A r.umber of guards have been searching
the wooos near Mormon Island bridge in
hope of petting some trace of "Red Shirt"
Gordon, who dropped from the ranks of
the convicts when Guard Ryan fired on
them at that point. Some of the guards
think that Gordon was killed.
MYSTERY OF GORDON.
"I made my way as far as the hotel at
Pyot Hill and I laid down there. The con
victs did not molest me while they were
at the hotel, and from that place I heard
the- sound of the firing. I remained at the
hotel all night with the posses that gath
rre-d there and I came back with Guard
Klcnzendorf in a wagon to the prison.
Garfield Hicks, a young: colored man
who works in a store at Folsom, was se
lected yesterday to drive the supply
wagon of the company of the National
Guard that came here from Placervllle by
special train and then proceeded to the
front under command of Captain Swlsler.
Kicks tells an interesting story of the
journey of the guardsmen to catch up
with the prison posses and the convict
band.
"We started from Folsom yesterday
;upt about 6 o'clock In the evening," he
paid, "and we followed the road taken by
:h#Â» convict.*?. It was very dark and we
had trouble at times to find our way.
XSje arrived at Pilot Hill about midnight.
There were a lot of prison guards, deputy
.^hrriffs and armed men gathered there.
They told us of the battle that had taken
place earlier in the evening between the
<-onviets and the men who were sent out
to capture them. I left there at daylight.
r.t'er th<Â« soldiers and other men went on
ahead after the soldiers. They said they
â¢lid not need me. as they had men from
Placc-rville to meet them at Pilot Hill. I
cprae back here to Folsom to return to
my work."
Everything is "very quiet at the prison
t "-night. Â» No definite information" has
reached the prison as to the identity of
The convict killed at Pilot Hill. Some of
the guards who were captured by the
convicts fay that the dead man is How

that the dead man is Convict Eldridge-
SOUNDS OF BATTLE.
"After we were captured yesterday and
we cot as far a"3 Mormon Island bridge
the convicts forced Guard Jeter and my
self to carry Convict Case, who was lame.
When we arrived at the bridge and Guard
Ryan fired at the convicts there was con
siderable excitement. The guards waved
their hands in the direction from which
the shots were fired in order to attract
attention to themselves and show that
they were unwilling members of the band.
"When we got in the wagon that the con
victs stole and we were within one mile
of Pilot Hill I was taken sick and vomited.
The convicts threw me over the back of
the wacon onto the road.

Jgf raided by the band of es
dfnfl caplng convicts and- his
wagon and four nbrse
team stolen, and who was
forced to drive for the desperadoes, re
turned to Folsom at 6 o'clock this even
ing. His story is as follows:
, "I was . coming down with two four
horse loads of wood toward Folsom from
my place when I was met by the band of
escaped convicts; This was right above
the house of Mr. Norris at Nigger Hill.
One of the convicts came up to my wagon
and told me to stop and unhitch 1 my team
and hitch the horses to Mr. Slotman'a
wagdta, of which they already had posses
sion.
"Slotman's wagon was loaded with
wood and they made myself and his two
hired men unload the wood. Then they
made me climb on the seat and drive.
They forced me to rush the horses from
the place where they captured me, up to
Derrington's . ranch, where they let me
take my time until they got to^Pilot Hill
in the afternoon. ' . Â¦ '
LOOTING OF A STORE.
"When we got to Pilot Hill all the con
victs got out and made me drive down to
the hotel. They then walked to the hotel
and made the people there prepare dinner
for all of -us, convicts and guards and
others. They helped themselves to every
thing in the store. They remained there
from 2 till about 5 o'clock in the evening.
When the stage from Auburn passed,
shortly after 5, they ordered me to get on
the seat of the wagon and for the rest
of the captured men to get on board.
They ordered me to take the road which
led to Lotus.
"When I was going around the corner
of the schoolhouse one of the convicts
accidentally discharged his revolver. I
went about one hundred feet farther on.
when all of a sudden bullets began to
fly on all sides of us from all directions.
The convicts spoke up and yelled at me
to whip up the horses and said they
would shoot me if I did not hurry.
"The convict who was on the seat with
me Jumped off the seat to the ground and
punched the horses in the ribs with a rifle
to make them, go faster. Then one of the
wheelers was shot by the posse in the
forward foot. It fell down and got up
again and then the animal was shot
through the stomach and dropped dead.
Two of my other horses were also shot
and injured. Â¦
"In the meantime I Jumped off the seat
and then the tiring stopped in a little
while. The negro convict, Seavia, then
wanted to have the convicts to each grab
one of the captured men by the neck,
hold him In front of them and return the
fire. 'Frenchy* Theron. and Woods order
ed Seavis not to do this, but to get to
the woods. Then we all got out of the
wagon and the convicts took hold of us,
but they did not fire on the posse in the
trees on the sides of the road.
TRAVEL OVER HILLS.
'TVe got Into the wooos and started to
climb the top of a hill. Some of the con
victa became exhausted and we had to
stop until they could go on. They took
us across the hill to a place called Rock
Canyon. The ground was so steep it was
Impossible to walk. We had all of us to
slide all the way. "We got into the can
yon and then the convicts got us into a
growth of large willow trees. Some of
the guards accidentally slid over a rock
into a pool of water. "We then went over
another hill and the . guards were com
pelled to help some of the convicts, as
they were completely exhausted.
"When we 'got to the top of the second
hill we all eat down to rest, as we were
almost played out. They kept us there
until after 10 o'clock last night when> they
held a council among themselves. They
then told us to take to the woods and
go. We left them there and we came
back. We followed the ridge for about
three miles and came to some open
ground. As we were afraid we might
come across some strange officers who
were hunting for the convicts, we laid
down and slept until daylight. Then we
came back to the hotel at Pilot Hill and
passed the posses going along the road
and we told them where we had left tha
convicts. At Pilot Hill we all got some
thing to eat and I came Into Folsom with

ramento to take revenge
upon Superior Judge E.
C. Hart for sending him to Folsom prison
for the long term of forty-flve years.
Late to-night Chief of Police Sullivan I
was visited and asked if he had heard
the story of Gordon's alleged threat.
Chief Sullivan replied that the story had j
reached him and that he was taking
every precaution to protect Judge Hart
from possible harm.
In the gar.g of desperadoes for whom
"the officers and soldiers are searching the
foothills of El Dorado are four convicts
'sectenced to Folsom by Superior Judge
Hart of this county. Their names, with
.the duration cf the sentences imposed
upon them by Judge Hart, are as follows:
Richard M. Gordon, forty-flve years, for
robbery; Fred Howard, fifteen years, for
robbery; Albert Seavis. twenty-five years,
for robbery; Ray Fahey, life imprison
ment, for robbery.
The name of Judge Hart h&s been a

has presided over the criminal court. The

During his service on the bench Judge
Hart has sent more than a score of dan
gerous criminals to terms the equivalent
of life Imprisonment. To this public ser
vice, with that rendered by Chief Sullivan
and his officers In ferretinsr out the
crimes, the citizens regard as due the
ridding of this community of the class of
desperadoes of whom Gordon, Howard,
Seavls and Fahey are types.
Under the name of Harry. Freer Gordon
served two terms in the Illinois peniten
tiary. In the crime which he committed
in Sacramento he had two confederates,
Fred and Amos Spellman. Judge Hart
sent Fred Spellman to the State's prison
for thirty-five years and 'Amos Spellman
for thirty years. One of the brothers got
into a fight In Folsom and was killed. '
Auburn saying a story had reached his
office that Gordon and another man,
whose name was not given, had deserted,
their fellow convicts in the hills and had
boarded a train some distance from Au
burn for Sacramento. I Immediately de
tailed officers to appear in plain clothes
In the neighborhoods which, from his past
history. I was sure Gordon would seek. I
remained on active duty until nearly
daybreak for the purpose of aiding In the
capture should Gordon strike town."
However, there Is little use to worry or
repine. The throat cf the splendid West
has been clutched by the bloodless fin
gers of Eastern conventionality. Why,
not so long since this same Judge Reeder
fined a cowboy 110 for punching the eye
of a barkeep who didn't mix his toddy
properly! It is only a question of time
when Western gents will be expected to
take off their hAs to Western ladies.
There was a dance at Hays City recently

A brief note in a Russell paper states
that Judge Jim Reeder of the District
Court haa informed the members of the
local bar that they will no longer be al
lowed to appear in court in their shirt
sleeves. Probably Judge Reeder is not to
blame for this. He seems to be simply
the helpless instrument of that effete
clvlllration of the East which Is over
whelming the primitive democracy of the
boundless prairies. But nevertheless this
order will sorely try the souls of a few
remaining members of the ancient West
ern bar who did not consider themselves
equipped for business until coat was off,
suspenders down and shirt thrown open
at the neckband. Coatu. indeed! Time
enough has not yet elapsed to make us

used to come to this selfsame court in
overalls, army shirt and bare feet, often
giving slight annoyance to his brother at
torneys by working the mud from be

elevated above the common table. And

PROMCCEN'T OFFICIALS OF SACRAMENTO WHO ARE MUCH CONCERNED OVER THE REPORT THAT ONE
OF THE DESPERATE CONVICTS WHO ESCAPED FROM THE FOLSOM PRISON WILL MAKE"*AN AT
-"â TEMPT ON THE LIFE OF A FANCIED ENEMY ON THE BENCH.
Now that the excitement of yes
terday has partly subsided and a
careful review of yesterday's out
break is made, it is . .the. general
opinion of all that no blame can
be attached to any . one : person.
Evidence is ; already in the pos
session $1 Warden Wilkinson
showing that the outbreak was
planned a year ago and also to
take place six months ago. On
both of these occasions some of
the band of convict plotters weak
ened and gave certain information
that led to the frustration of the
plots to break for liberty.
One year ago dirk knives were
found in the cells. of some of ,'the
convicts, and a similar discovery
was made six months ago. Con
vict Wqods boasted of the plots
yesterday to Guard Klenzendorf
while the officer was a captive of
the escaping prisoners.
"You thought you were pretty
smart, Jack," said Woods, as he
brandished a big dirk in the* of
ficer's face, "but we were too
smart for you this time and your
band of stoolies. We could have
turned the trick a year ago, and
also six months ago, but your
stoolies peached on us and you got
our knives. But this time we
fooled you all."
Guard- Klenzendorf is the of
ficer who on the above mentioned
occasions discovered the knives in
certain cells and portions of the
prison. There is no doubt but
that certain convicts enabled the
band to make a successful break
for liberty. While some of the
long dirks that were wielded yes
terday were made out of files, the
presence of razors showed that
outside aid had been secured. A
piece of broken razor was picked
up in the prison yard last evening,
and it must have belonged to one
of the weapons used in the battle
in the office of the captain of the
guard. It is blood-stained and its
edge is keen and smooth. The
razor and many others must have
been smuggled into the prison at
some time, as' it is- impossible to
make such weapons out of any of
the prison implements used in the
rock quarries.
PLOT A YEAR OLD.
John Wild, S. A. Stewart, George
P. Gerber, C. Rigney, Michael
Cooney, C. H.' La France and E.
Sinas. The evidence of Warden
Wilkinson, Captain of the Guard
Murphy and other officials told
how the break from prison took
place and how Cotter and Joseph
Cochrane had been slashed with
razors and stabbed with dirks by
the band of desperate convicts.
The jury quickly returned a
verdict that Cotter came to his
death at the hands of the thirteen
convicts, whose names were
added to the findings. A charge
of willful murder was recorded
against the thirteen men and other
unknown accomplices who are
said, to have been cognizant of the
plot and who will be forced out by
a rigid investigation.
The body of Cotter was shipped
on this morning's train to his
home in Sacramento, one of his
sons being in charge of the re
mains. Joseph Cochrane is lying
at the Warden's house mortally
wounded. Everything is beiijg
done that medical skill can ac
complish, but his condition is very
grave and the doctor will not ex
press a definite opinion as to his
chances of recovery until the
next twenty-four hours have
elapsed. Most of the prisoners
here were locked in their cells to
day, and only a few% necessary for
certain work, were seen about the
yards and grounds.

A Petaluma
Miracle
This week we announce the re-
covery from Bright's Disease of
Mr. Jorgensen, farmer, well
known in Two Rock Valley, near
Petaluma. His wife, Mrs. M. C.
Jorgensen, transmits the follow-
ing facts: v\
"In December my husband was be-
lieved to be dying. Was nearly blind,
and in convulsions, passing rapidly
from one to the other, when the Ful-
ton Compound was administered, the
first few doses having to be forced
down him. ,The third day he began
to clear up. Improvement was con-
tinuous, eyesight returned and he is
now about and over the farm as usual..
The whole neighborhood knows all
about it, as does also the attending
physician, one of the best in the
county." .

the north and east In a moment and
which would have taken an Indefinite pe

seven-foot pole at the corner of-Wlnthrop
and Puyallup avenues carries two 100-wlre
cables, besides many local exchange wires
and all out of town wires. This pole, near
the ground. Is three feet In diameter and
was found on Sunday morning to have

LONDON. July 29.â The Dally Chronicle
this morning, en authority of "a usually
well-informed correspondent." hears that
peace will be preserved in the Far East
throughout the coming winter. The cor
respondent says that Russia has made im
portant concessions to the United States
and Japan, while Great Britain, which
has conducted her negotiations on more
sober lines, also has obtained her desires.
The Chronicle adds that an Important
Russian statement will be issued. shortly.
Meanwhile, the paper adds, it is signifi
cant that two British warships have Just
left Wolhalwel.
"It is understood," says the Chronicle,
"that the strained situation In the Far
East was discussed in council In London
last week, and that the present happy
issue of negotiations was announced at
the council."
The Influx has become so great that the
Mexican Government is said to be seri
ously considering issuing a decree re
straining further immigration. Informa
tion in the hands of United States author
ities shows that the object of many of
these Chinese who are brought to Mexico
Is to reach the United States and that
they cross, the border without detection.
Since the new steamship line that plies
direct between China and ports on the
Pacific Coast was put into operation sev
eral months ago Chinese are being
brought Into this country at the rate of
about 10,000 a month. It ia said that more
than 100,000 Chinese will have been
brought "over, by the close of the present
year.
.AUSTIN, Tex.. July 2S.â It i3 stated by
the United States authorities of this dis
trict, which borders on the Rio Grande,
that there is more smuggling of Chinese
into this country from Mexico now than
ever before and that it is found necessary
to greatly increase the force of inspectors
on the border, with the view of checking
the violations of the Chinese exclusion
act.

OROVILLE, July 28.â One of the most
successful hunting trips for some year3
occurred lately in Bucks Valley, Plumas
County. Lee Rutherford and Roy Woods
of Modesto visited the valley prepared to
hunt any kind of game. Rutherford as a
boy knew the country thoroughly. He
and h 4 is companion were very successful
in hunting deer, and one of the bucks
killed was the largest seen in Plumas for
some years. Cows and yearlings had been
killed in the valley by bears, and a num
ber of men were engaged in hunting them.
Rutherford and Woods set traps and were
successful in catching three bears. These
were shot while still held in the trap with
the exception of one very large one, which
had been caught by one foot in a steel
trap. The bear gnawed at his foot until
he ate it off. and was thus enabled to es
cape.

SAN. MATEO. July 28.â The Rev. How
ard Osborne arrived here June 10, accom
panied by his wife. He is taking a spe
cial course at the Episcopalian . Divinity
School. He said this evening that the
Portland warrant had probably been is
sued at the instance of a photo supply
house there to whom he was Indebted for
lantern slides he had. used in illustrating
a course of lectures. He owes, he says,
J3S, and is willing to pay that sum. The
Portland firm, however, claims 532, and a
few days ago sent him, he says, a letter
in which they .threatened criminal pro
ceedings unless he settled promptly for
the larger sum.
The specific charge upon which the
warrants for his arrest are issued is the
mortgaging of his farm and other prop
erty at Independence and then selling the
same as free from incumbrance at a high
figure. Besides this, he has several other
charges against him gaining publicity," all
of a financial character and Involving his
honesty. Osborne recently left his Meth
odist church membership to pursue post
graduate study in the Episcopal Seminary
at San Mateo, where he now is.
Osborne is grand lecturer of the Order
of United Workmen of Oregon and
prior to going to California had been giv
ing illustrated lectures along the South
ern Pacific -Railroad, from Portland to
Ashland, at a salary of $200 per month.
He is a magnetic speaker and a fine
singer, and as far as yet known has al
ways borne a good reputation. By friends
It is believed that the unhappy event will
turn out to be only spiteful work of those
who dislike Osborne's defection from
the Methodist denomination.
Osborne is an Englishman by birth and
is married. He has no family. His
change of church membership, he claims,
was at a great personal sacrifice finan
cially, involving the loss of salary as lec
turer for the Workmen.
PORTLAND, Or., July 28.â Warrants

raised money recently by fraudulent
means, on the occasion of bis resignation
and removal from there.

Deputy Sheriff Butts refused to allow
the young men in Jail to be interviewed,
but stated that thev came to his office
about 3 o'clock and surrendered them
selves, saying they had killed a boy while
shooting at a mark. They were shooting

V HAMHf'ON / \ LIN^LN / V MORAC^MANN / V EViiSfNQ /s-y TATISTICS of street and electric railways have
just been issued in an elaborate bulletin from
the Census Office. They give figures of rail
ways for the year 1902 and for 1890, and thus show
the developments that have taken place in the indus
try during the intervening period. The showing is
in many respects- a remarkable one, but is chiefly no
table for: the figures relating to the substitution of
electricity forother forms of motive power, and the
tendency toward combining small companies and cor
porations into larger ones. .*
For the purposes of the bulletin the term "street
and electric railways" is used to include "all electric
railways, irrespective of their length or location, and
all street-railways, irrespective of their motive
power." It is noted that in 1800 the railroads that
used any motive power other than .'steam were con
fined almost exclusively to urban districts and were
therefore properly classed as' street railways;- but
the use of electricity has enabletl operating companies
to extend their lines into the rural districts, and a
large percentage of the track in 1902 was found but
side the limits orcitics, towns or villages. An effort

Mr. Crawford says there are three phases of sen
timent among the Cardinals and those who are sup
posed to have influence with them. Of those he says:
"Some people can see no safety for the church* ex
cept in skillful policy, and they accordingly desire
a 'political' Pope, a statesman, at peace with -all the
states and their rulers, upholding their authority and
himself upheld by them. Others hope for a 'theo
logical' Pontiff, who is to defend the dogmas of the
church and of Christian wisdom, fulminating against
the errors of all such reasoning as they consider over
free and rebellious against the will of God. Lastly,
there are many who dream of a humble, charitable
pious Pope, who shall renew the miraculous con
version of mankind by truly apostolic means."
Of course there is no prominent candidate for the
succession who <ioes not in a measure possess all
the desired characteristics, but still each is identified
more or less with one of them. Rampolla is the
favorite of those who desire a political Pope, but
Crawford does not deem his election likely.. He
says many persons believe he will be elected because
of the immense influence he gained under Leo, but
adds: "I believe a different political tendency is
expected -from the next Pope, and that the great
power so long wielded by Cardinal Rampolla will
in the end do him more harm than good" in the
opinion of the conclave."
Reviewing one by one the characteristics and the
prospects of other prominent Cardinals, Mr. Craw
ford concludes that Gotti is most likely to
succeed, and says: "The obscurity of his monastic
life enhances the affectionate esteem in which he h
held by the other Cardinals.. He was suddenly
brought from the silence of his cell to Rome, to be
raised almost directly to the cardinalate, after one
short mission to Brazil, and the monastic humility
and simplicity which are a second nature with him
make his high merit more conspicuous, and confer
upon him the sort of power which is not- feared but
I loved." <*;- V:
"Public interest in the election is of course far
wider than the widespread reach of the church itself,
for the character and the aims of a Pope are matters
of universal concern and affect Protestant peoples al
most as much as Catholics. It will therefore be a
matter of great moment whether the successor of
Leo be a political, theological or an apostolic Pontiff,
and the world waits the result with aÂ» feeling far
deeper than that of curiosity. ; ; r Â¦
/-> PECULATIONS concerning the probable suc-
ccssor to the Papal throne are too conflicting to
be of much value, but a contribution to the
subject by Marion Crawford is of interest because,
as he has been selected to write the official life of the
late Pope, it is fair to assume that his relations with
the Vatican are sufficiently close to afford him, a
fairly accurate knowledge of the situation. For that
reason his recent article on the subject is deserving
of notice, and while it does not undertake to fore
cast the result or to predict the .winner, it throws' a
good deal of light upon the issues at stake.

In view of the mixed nationalities in Chicago the
rules might have gone further. It is the habit of
Russian cooks to spit in the soup. A Russian Minis
ter in Washington once gave a diplomatic dinner.
When soup was served his wife assured the guests
that they could take it safely, for it had not been
*pat in, as she made it herself. This singular re
mark provoked inquiry, when it developed that the
lady thought every one knew that Russian cooks al
ways spit in the soup. As that is the only kind of
soup to be had in Russia the people learn to eat it
without objection and the cook is permitted to spit
in it for luck. Chicago cooks may under the agree
ment spit in the soup if they like, under the legal
rale that what is not forbidden is permitted; but
they, must keep clean hands and not scratch their
heads over the gridiron, like Dr. Sam Johnson's
Scotch boy, whose mother had taken his, cap to boil
the pudding in.
The barkeepers joined in this strike out of sym
pathy and emerge from it regulated, like the rest.
They are compelled to abstain from the use of to
hacco while on duty and from all intoxicating drinks.
The segar "on the house" and regular beers are no
more. When the '"barkeep" is off duty he can re
tire to the outside of his fortification and order his
drink and pay for it, like any other customer. For
and in consideration ol obeying all rules, regulations
and conditions the employes concerned receive an
advance of io per cent in wages. The public, in
view of the addition to its comfort and sense of
greater security in the cleanness of what it cats
and drinks, will be willing to have that small addi-
As far as known it is the first time that a strike
h2s ended in the fixing of a code of ethics for the
occupations concerned. It is to be hoped that the
example will spreads for there are many occupations
that have contact with the public in which good man
ners and attention are the last thing thought of, and
usually are left out entirely. The public is a poor,
patient, raw-boned beast, with its withers wrung so
constantly that they are used to being galled,- and
the poor old thing is glad to know that it is not to
have cigar or cigarette ash or tobaceo spit with its
steak and chops, and is not to have cuds of chewing
gum in its soup. Chicago has done many original
things, from using Lake Michigan for a Teservoir and
the Mississippi River as a sewer, but none of its
originalities is likely to be of more useful example
than the conditions on which the great hotel and
restaurant strike is settled.
THE conclusion of the strike of occupations re
lated to hotels and boarding-houses in Chicago
is of interest because of the review of the issues
presented in the of the final settlement. The
tirst demand was made by the Waitresses' Union, and
was for the right to chew gum while on duty. This
habit had been forbidden by the employers because
a gum-chewing waitress was offensive to their
patrons. The girls struck for the sacred right to
chew gum, and a sympathetic strike, boycott and
much inconvenience and loss followed. Finally a set
tlement was made by which the waitresses go gum
less while on duty, and cooks are forbidden to smoke
or chew tobacco while cooking, and agree to ob
serve other regulations required for cleanliness.

Rebellion's torch is again raised in Venezuela and
Castro is once more on his mettle. If press reports
of casualties are to be as exaggerated as they have
been in similar diversions of the Venezuelans the
Government will have to import victims to kill as

LONDONDERRY. Ireland. July S.-
King Edward and Queen Alexandra were
accorded a great reception on their ar
rival here to-day. Large crowds from
the su^roundlns districts assembled to
greet the first English sovereign who had
ever visited Londonderry. Their Majrs-
Jies were met at. the railroad station by
the Mayor and Corporation. The usual
number of addresses were presented rÂ«>
pTyTns to which thÂ« King expressed his
pleasure at the references to the spirit of
good feeling and harmony pervadng a
classes in Ireland, adding Â£at *f Ws jls t
helped to extend and consolidate this fee
ing he would be richly "warded
Their Majesties subsequently tooL
luncheon at the Guildhall and attended a
variety of functions. Among the pleasan*.
incidents waa the presentation of a special
address to the Queen from the women of
Londonderry. The King, replying in be
half of the Queens expressed the opinion
that the "hicher education of women 13
one of the happiest features of our time.
After the King had laid tnÂ» foundation
of Brooke Park their Majesties left Lon
donderry for Buncrana. where they em
barked on the royal yacht Victoria and
Albert for a cruise along the coast.
Mr. Cannon's "grave doubts" whether there is any
present necessity for financial legislation are not
shared by those who are most familiar with the situa
tion. The demand for an clastic currency comes not
from the brokers and speculators of Wall street, but'
from the business men and bankers of the whole
country. The Call has repeatedly directed attention
to statements of leading bankers in the various agri
cultural States pointing out the danger of the pres
ent strain upon the banks in handling the crops.- R&
cently another important declaration has been made
on the subject which is worth noting. Mr. Charles M.
Harger of Kansas in describing the conditions in that
State says that the State Employment Bureau esti
mates that 20,000 extra men are employed during the
harvest season in Kansas, and that their wages alone
amount to upward of $200,000 a week. Mr. Harger
calculates that the States of the Mississippi Valley
require something like $50,000,000 to handle their har
vests, and as Western money has been sent. East for
deposit during the winter and the spring, the har T
vest money will have to be obtained by withdrawing
the loans, thus putting a heavy drain upon the East
ern money centers.
It is not the harvest wages, however, that consti
tute the heaviest strain upon the currency. A Kan
sas Danker is quoted as saying that during the wheat
selling season his bank handles. $50,000 a day, one
fifth of it going over the counter in cash. That sort
of thing of course is going on all over the country
during the selling season, and as a consequence a
much larger sum of money is needed then than at
other times. The country is growing, the harvests
are increasing, the demand for money during the
summer and fall to handle and market the crops is
augmenting. Under such circumstances an elastic
currency has become, a genuine necessity of the
time.
It is gratifying to learn that Mr. Cannon has no
intention of making an obstinate fight against the
desired legislation. It would be a serious evil if the
Senate and the House should get into conflict over
the issue. Differences of opinion exist as to the best
means of providing elasticity, and those in themselves
are sufficiently formidable to make it doubtful
whether agreement cao be reached during the extra
session. It would then have been almost equivalent
to a foregone defeat had another opposing force
been thrown into the conflict. As the matter now
stands there is reasonable hope of the desired legis
lation during the extra session, and almost a cer
tainty that if denied at that time it will be enacted
during the regular session before the winter is over.
FROM New York comes a 'suggestion that a
national convention be called to consider the
currency problems of the country and to rec
ommend definite legislation- on the subject to Con
gress when it assembles in extra session. Such a con
vention of course would do no harm and might do
some good, provided it were thoroughly representa
tive of the business interests of the whole country.
There is, however, a danger that if it were held in
New York City it might become associated in the
public mind with Wall street, and in that way rouse
prejudice against any 'measure it might indorse.
As a matter of fact no convention is needed. At a
time when the issue was new and its problems were
not understood by the people a national conference
on the subject was held and a campaign of education
started. That campaign has now been carried on ex
tensively, and til persons who are at all interested in
currency and banking questions have virtually made
up their mind,s as to the importance of immediate
legislation. A national convention at this day, there
fore, would come almost too late to be of any value
so far as the country itself is concerned, though if if
were thoroughly representative it might have a bene
ficial influence in hastening the action of Congress.
Reports from various parts of the country tend to
encourage the hope of those who look for effective
legislation this winter. Mr. Cannon, who was quoted
not long ago as being positively opposed to any
change in our currency laws, has since that time mod
ified his original statements and now declares himself
willing to promote the passage of any good bill .on
the subject, provided the necessity for it can be
shown. . .
The new attitude of Mr. Cannon was made known
after his recent conference with the President.
While denying that any official or formal conference
on the currency problem had taken place, and refus
ing to give out an interview, he made statements
which authorized the New York papers to say: "As
a result of Mr. Cannon's ilisit to-day it can be said
that the report that he is opposed to any agitation
of the financial question at present and will use his
influence as Speaker of the House, when elected, to
block measures tending in that direction, is not ac
curate. Mr. Cannon has a very strong opinion as to
the advisability of changing the currency laws at
present, and does not approve of some proposed
financial legislation. Personally he has grave doubts
whether there is any present necessity for financial
legislation, but it is possible, he thinks, that condi
tions may be such before the extra session con
venes as to make the passage of financial measures
necessary. If at that time there are such conditions,
and if there is a sound public sentiment in favor of
the legislation, he will not stand in the way of the
administration's desire for a change in the currency
laws."

was made to segregate the figures of urban from
those of rural lines, but it .was found impossible to
do so with any accuracy because in the' more thickly
settled States towns and villages are so close to
gether that a distinction between urban and .rural
with respect to railways could not be always ob
served.
The figures show that in 1890 there were 1261 miles
of elcctjric track, while in 1902 there were 21,920.
During the same .period the track on which animal
power was used diminished from 5661 miles to 259
miles. Cable tracks diminished from 488 to 240
miles, and steam track from 711 to 169. Thus the
percentage - of increase for electric roads was 1637
per cent, while the decrease in other lines was 86 per
cent for animal power, 50 per cent for. cable power
and 76 per cent for steam.
The progress of "combination"- is revealed* in the
figures showing the average mileage operated per
company. In 1890 the average was 7.41 miles, while
in 1002 it was 20.38 miles; thus the average operating
company in 1902 controlled almost three times the
length of line controlled by the average company,
in 1890. In the former year there were only eight
companies operating more than fifty miles of line,
while in 1002 there were sixty-nine such companies.
It is added: "While there are still a' large number of
companies that operate less than twenty miles of
track, the portion of the total length of line operated
by them is not half so great as in 1800."
Efforts to obtain accurate statistics relating to^
cost of construction, capitalization, etc., were unsuc
cessful. The .-bulletin says: "A large number of
companies reported th?t it was impossible to give
an itemized statement. * * ? It appears that a
number of companies reported the cost of construc
tion as equalized with the amount of capital stock,
funded debt, bills and accounts payable, etc. In such
cases the comparison of the cost of construction
with the capitalization loses all significance. Many
large consolidated companies also reported as their
cost of construction and equipment the amount paid
by them in cash and securities for the roads pur
chased, an amount based on earning capacity rather
than on the cost of construction." While figures of
that kind are of comparatively little value, the bul
letin notes that the total reported cost of construc
tion increased during the period under review 456
per cent, as compared with an increase of 382 per
cent in the combined par value of capital stock and
funded debt.

HISTORY OF SOCIETY
OF THE CINCINNATI
Organized in Georgia at the Close of
the War of the Revo
lution. \
The Society of the Cincinnati was or
ganized in the State of Georgia in Sep
tember, 1783. On May 13, 17S3, officers of
the continental army met at the Verplank
house, near Fisbklll, on the Hudson river,
to organize a military order to commemo
rate the securing of peace and independ
ence to the United States anu to form a
tie of friendship among the brother offi
cers; the right of membership to "descend
to the oldest son, says the Sunny South.
The following constitution was then
adopted and never chanced:
"It having pleased the Supreme Gov
ernor of the Universe In the disposition
of human affairs, to cause the separation
of thÂ« colonies of North America from
the domination of Great Britain, and
after a bloody conflict of eight years to
establish them free, independent and sov
ereign states, connected by alliances,
founded on reciprocal advantages, with
some of the greatest princes and powers
of the earthâ
"To perpetuate, therefore, as well the
remembrance of this vast event as the
mutual friendships which have been
formed under the pressure of common
danger, and, in many Instances, cement
ed bv the blood of the parties.' the offi
cers of the American army do hereby,
in the most solemn manner, associate,
constitute and combine themselves into
one society of friends, to endure as long
as they endure or any of their eldest male
posterity, and in failure thereof, the col
lateral branches who may be judged
worthy of becoming Its supporters and
members.
"The . oflicers of the American army,
having generally been taken from, the
citizens of America, possess high venera
tion for the character of that illustrious
Roman, Lucius Quintus Cincinnati^, and
being resolved to follow his example by
returning to their citizenship, they think
they may, with propriety, denominate
themselves the Society of the Cincinnati."
There were thirteen State societies con
stituted in the United States and one in
France. In 17S4 the French naval officers
sent General George Washington the In
signia or eagle of the order set in dia
monds. This has been worn by each of
the presidents-general.
In 1S54 the society decided to admit as
members the proper descendant of a con
tinental officer who had a right to become
an original member but who did ncr^
on the payment of a certain sum to bÂ©
fixed by each State society. Thus In
MassacKusetts - the amount required 13
$700, while in Rhode Island. New York,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania $50 is
charged.

to increase the flavor of the tobaccq.it
is then treated with a decoction of mar

pared as above described differs in no
way from that of ordinary tobacco.
At the four corners of the catafalque
burned candles ten feet high. Beside
these stood Noble Guards, motionless,
with drawn swords. Other Noble Guards
were placed at the entranoe. Immediately
beyond, in reserved places, were all the
diplomats. The intermingled uniforms of
France, Russia. Prussia, Austria, Spain,
Portugal, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Guate-
It will cover an area of 1240 acres, or
nearly two square miles, containing more
than 200 acres under roof, composed of
some seventy-five buildings varying in
size from one to eighteen acres. * There
will be more than two miles of water
ways, with beautiful - landscape ' and gar
den effects. A railway will skirt the
grounds within its limits and there will
be countless jinriklshas, automobiles,
chairs and other ' movable conveyances
for the comfort of Â» world's fair patrons.
When the gates of the .world's fair are
thrown open next May over $35,000,000 will
have been expended.
The different State buildings will oc
cupy a section of the grounds by them
selves, located admirably on broad ave
nues, but California's State building will
be apart from that locality. It is splen
didly situated on a commanding knoll of
ground and, adjacent to the special pavil
ions of the foreign countries up near the
Administration building. AH- eyes are
turned to the display California will make
and it is confidently expected that the in
defatigable efforts of Messrs. Filcher and
Wiggins, California's commissioners, | will
lead to results that 1 will ' surpass * those at
Chicago in 1S33. ,___,,__...- â
. In the Sistine Chapel stood a huge white
catafalque, ten feet high, and on it, updn
two cushions, rested the triple crown of
gold, shining brightly in the light of a
hundred candles. The catafalque com
pletely hid the altar. Flanking the cata
falque, on benches, eat all of the Cardin
als of the Sacred College, who wore scar
let caps. At their feet, on stools, were
the conclavists, or secretaries, in violet.
In the narrow aisle behind, between the
benches and the walls, the Archbishops,
patriarchs, monsignors and monks knelt
or stood in picturesque confusion.
ROME, July 28.â The first of the three
great requiem masses under the auspices
of the Sacred College for the repose of
the soul of Pope Leo was celebrated this
morning in the Sistine Chapel. All of
the Cardinals now in Rome, the diplo
matic corps, the Roman nobility and
many other distinguished persons were
present. No such mass had been said in
Rome since the death of Pius IX.
Remarkably Impressive Ceremony in
the Sistine Chapel.
SOLEMN REQUIEM MASS.
LOS ANGELES. July 28.â Mass for the
repose of the soul of Pope Leo XIII was
said in St. Vlbiana's Cathedral to-day.
Bishop Thomas Conaty was the celebrant.
The cathedral was crowded. Bishop Con
aty delivered a sermon upon the life and
character of the late Pope.

church doors he shouted "Death to the
P6pe." A crowd of counter-manifestants
followed the police, but the would-be dis
turber was safely lodged In Jail.
The exit of General Andre and his staff
brought out hisses and resulted in the ar
rest of the most prominent of those who
expressed their disapproval of the Minis
ter. - ,\>
The' Abbe Perosi, Italy's famous ora
torio composer, waved his baton and the
slknco was broken" by the notes of the
Dies Irae. Those who know the Vatican
well say the matchless Sistine choir never
sang as it did to-day: Through the his
toric chapel the voices of boys and men
rose and fell and swelled triumphantly,
as If with songs of paradise, the voice
dying almost to a whisper at thejmentlon
of death. The Cardinals sat spellbound at
this perfection of Gregorian chant. Not
a note of instrumental music was heard
throughout, the mass.
At the altar Cardinal Seraflno Vannu
telli was assisted by Cardinals Agllardi,
Vincenzo Vannutelli, Satolli and Rich
ards, wearing white miters and glisten
ing vestments. Cardinal Satolli, always
erect' and swarthy, looked doubly so be
side the feeble \ frame and snow-white
head of the aged Cardinal Richards,
Archbishop of Paris.
As the fifty Cardinals and fifty con
clavists gathered around the catafalque
and alternately knelt and arose their
movements resembled an amazing kaleid
oscope of crimson and violet, with colors
so bright as to be almost trying to the
eyes.
Then "came the singing of the "Sanc
tus," modulated almost into | a whisper.
All' present knelt as . the choir ceased In
toning its grand chant, and the dead si
lence of the consecration which followed
was suddenly broken by the clash of arms
as the Noble Guards presented swords.
Then there was : another clatter of arms
a& the soldiers' â¢ scabbards clashed on the
marble flooring when tkey dropped on one
knee, lowered their swords and brought
their left hands to j their helmets in' rigid
salute /.,,.â¢â¢"* / \ -â¢-./'Â¦
Clouds of incen3e arose from the censers
until Michael Angelo's famous "Last
Judgment" was almost hidden from view.
Suddenly the sharp tinkling of a bell
rang through the edifice and told the wor
shipers that the, host had been elevated. Â« â¢
At the conclusion* of the mass the choir
a gain burst r out into song, and Cardina I
Seraflno Vannutelli, preceded by, the cross
bearer, passed â¢ solemnly around the . cata
falque ; after \ j sprinkling it with .;, holy
water. - The other - Cardinals . followed Â¦ in
turn,' and' the' ceremony was concluded
with the chanting .of the "Oremus." It
was after j midday; when Cardinal Vannu
telli pronounced the final absolution. -;CÂ»
- Cardinal Gibbons 'had no part in the cel-
I ebratlen of the mass. He sat beside Car-
mala and Bavaria formed a vivid contrast
with the simple evening dress of the.Ro
man Princes and crape veils and black
dresses of the Princesses who sat directly
across the aisle.
â¢ In addition, *two salleries had been
erected. In the gallery on the left were
about a hundred ladles, all in deep black.
In the right gallery were the special mis
sions, among them being Sir Thomas Es
mondeand Captain Donelan, represent
ing the Irish Parliament. *
Beneath the galleries the priests and
laymen who had been fortunate enough
to obtain tickets, but who were not d!s*
tinguished enough for special places/were
packed in dim seclusion. Swiss and Noble
Guards, chamberlains and other Vatican
officials lined the aisles. Michael Angelo's
frescoes on ceiling and walls seemed
merely faint reflections of the brilliant
maze of color that stretched below from
door to pltar. '
During the ceremony one of the Noble
Guards on duty beside the catafalque was
overcome by the heat and had to be led
out. Another guardsman instantly took
hi.Â«Â» place.
The clear, strong voice with which Car
dinal Vannutelli chanted the mass created
no little admiration.
dlnai Martlnelli among the extraordinary
array of Cardinals, among whom Cardinal
Gotti, who instead of a scarlet cape wore
the white mangle of the Carmelite order,*
was one of the most prominent.
Cardinal Oreglia, dean of the Sacred
College, sat at the head of the left row
of Cardinals, near the altar steps. It was
noticed that he walked with an erectness
which, belied his years.
Cardinal Rampolla, one of the hand
somest of these princes of the church,
walked with a set face and with his head
held down.
CALIFORNIA'S BUILDING.
The plan of the Louisiana Purchase Ex
position is the most ambitious yet devised
in the history of exhibitions by reason of
the fact that its distinguishing charac
teristic Is to show not only the finished
products, but also ; the process of - their
manufacture; in other, words, to depict
life and action In their essential features.
The scope of the exposition- li immense.
Thte railway companies will convey dis
plays to St. Louis on a basis of full freight
rates going and no charge for '. return.
The fire equipment is admirable on the
exposition grounds and extraordinary pre
cautions have been adopted to guard
Â¦against fire. The work on the buildings
Is progressing at a rapid rate and what
has already been accomplished Is now the
marvel of the architectural .world;
The f purteen terminal companies run
ning into St. Louis are spending an ag
gregate of $7,000,000 for depot and switch
ing facilities, etc., to handle the big
crowds. The street rajlway companies
which will carry the bulk of the traffic
to and from the interior of the city are
also doubling their- facilities, and when
it Is remembered that St. Louis Is one of
the best and most completely equipped
cities in the world for street transporta
tion, a reasonable idea can be obtained of
what this means. The two' problems that
seriously concerned the exposition man
agement at first were thoee of accommo
dations and street - transportation, as the
fair grounds are some miles from
the heart of the city proper, but by
bending every energy to overcome the ob
stacles confronting them abundant ad
vantages will be offered the public.
There will be no "Midway," so. called,
but instead there will be the "Pike," upon
which all the concessions will be located.
These will be of a high order and will not
embody anything objectionable. The man
agement has been especially conservative
in this respect. The exposition wilh be,
closed e\-ery Sunday of the seven months
of its existence," from May 1 to December
1 This was provided by the act of Con
gress creating it. - /
The main exhibit buildings will be closed
at 6 o'clock every night, as it has been
learned by experience at. past exhibitrons
that people do not come at , night for
other than the amusements offered in the
concessions. . '. â¢ â
TRANSPORTATION - TO FAIR.
The reason for the postponement from
1903 to 1904 was due entirely to the wishes
of foreign countries, which declared that
if given more time they would be enabled
to make a far more creditable and desir
able showing.
Another point of Interest is the matter
of accommodations. There will be plenty
of room for the immense crowds that are
expected. There are at present In course
of construction a number of large, perma
nent hotels and apartment houses, in ad
dition to which numerous temporary
structures will be erected to meet the ne
cessities of the occasion. Besides 4hls,
there are countless private dwellings that
will afford excellent accommodations.
There need be no concern on the subject
of rooms and living at St. Louis during
the exposition period.
The question of transportation is an
important one and in this connection a
good idea may be gained of the steps be
ing taken by the railway companies to
provide for the enormous travel expected.
secretary of the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition, who Is now In San Francisco
on a private visit, states that the exposi
tion will positively be opened on May 1,
l?04, and that there will be absolutely no
delay or further postponement.
Harde* accompanied the world's fair
commissioner general, John Barrett, on
a circle of the globe In the interests of
the exposition. During the journey they
visited over two score cities and covered
over 40,000 miles of territory.
They succeeded In Inducing the nations
of the Orient to appropriate over $2,000,000
for their participation in the world's fair.
Mr. Barrett has recently been appointed
United States Minister to Argentine'Re
public, and at the request of the exposi
tion authorities Mr. Hardee has under
taken to complete the work Mr. Barrett
was obliged to leave unfinished.
IN order to dispel any misapprehen
sion as to the time when the* St.
IxjuIs world's fair will bo opened
Theodore Hardee, assistant to the
OFFICIAL OF THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE EXPOSITION WHO SATS
THE GREAT FAIR WILL. OPEN ON TIME AND THAT THERE WILL
BE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR ALL.
That there is a conviction at the Vatican
that the conclave will be of short dura
tion is proved by the fact that all those
who are to enter the conclave to minister
to the wants of the Cardinals have been
engaged for just three days.
It is officially announced that in addi
tion to the will of the late Pope, and
separate from it, Leo XIII left a trifling
present to each of a long list of relatives,
members of the papal household, prelates,
directors. Cardinals, etc. As many for
malities have to be observed it probably
will be some time before the gifts are de
livered.
As the fisherman's ring, which could not
be found after the death of the Pope,
may be discovered in some drawer which
is sealed up and cannot be opened until
after the election of the new Pope, the
camerllngo, Cardinal Oreglia, has ordered
a new one for use in the symbolic cere
mony which will occur after, the suc
cessor to Pope Leo XIII is chosen.
Cardinal Oreglia called him to the desk
and gently chided him for not greeting
the president on his arrival. Cardinal
Richelmy apologized and the two Car
dinals cordially embraced.
One of the Cardinals said that he had
first learned the terms of Pope Leo's will
from the newspapers, and he protested
against this. Cardinal Oreglia replied
that it was the fault of the executors,
one of whom later explained that It was
considered a private matter. The object
ing Cardinal responded that as the Sacred
College had inherited the whole property
it would have been more fitting if the
heirs had been informed before the news
papers.
To-day's congregation was marked by
two Incidents. Cardinal Rtchelmy," Arch
bishop of Turin, attended for the first
time. When he entered he went directly
to Cardinal Rampolla, conversed with
him for some moments and then took his
seat.
ROME, July 28.â It Implies no disrespect
to say that a papal caucuses developing
on much the same lines as caucuses held
on the eve of an -American nomination
and nominating convention. It is now an
open secret that the supporters of Car
dinals R&mpolla and Gottl will vote for
their respective candidates on the first
ballot, after which the one who leads in
the vote will receive the unanimous sup
port of both parties.
The College, as a whole, is fast divid
ing for and against Cardinal Rampolla.
There are, however,' three classes â Car
dinal Rampolla's direct supporters, those
who will vote for him; those who will
vote with him, but not for him, and those
who will vote against him and his policy.
His supporters argue that if the policy
of the late administration was Pope Leo's,
then Cardinal Rampolla is the best man
to continue it. If it was dictated by Car
dinal Rampolla, then there is greater rea
son that he should continue it. His op
ponents urge that the outgoing adminis
tration sought to ingratiate the Papacy
with governments, 'not with peoples.
Hence, when the French government
showed its teeth the church did not have
the French people back of it.
The Cardinals who argue thus, includ
ing the supporters of Cardinal Vannu
telli, agree with Cardinal Gibbons that
the church will be strongest when it is
absolutely independent of all political
powers.
Those who oppose Cardinal Rampolla
are divided in supporting Cardinals Van
nutclll, Oreglia anÂ«W Agliardl. Should the
contest become strenuous, it is probable
that some neutral candidate like Sarto,
Satolli, Cvampa, or Ferrari will finally be
selected.

sible by actually performing it -with steel
flying machines nearly 1000 times heavier
than air, , driven by steam These ma
chines weighed from thirty; to forty
pounds, and flew from one-half. to three
quarters of a mile at speeds varying
from twenty to thirty miles an hour. It
is believed by Dr. Langley that the time
is now very near when human beings

conditions, such as are demanded in the

"The committee finds that there exists
upon the wards, among the attendants,
careless practices in the handling of pa
tients, that frequently amount to unwar
ranted force and punishment and some
times to cruelty. There exists among the
attendants a kind of secret understanding
which has the Influence of restraining one
attendant from informing the superin

conduct and abuses on the part of other
attendants toward the patients."

"In a financial institution, the tempta
tion with which the clerks are beset, and
the opportunities for wrongdoing are so
multiplied that great care and discretion
should be exercised in the selection of
men to fill these positions of trust. Thus
the prime qualifications for a bank clerk
should be strict integrity of character. It
matters not how much ability a man may
possess, how favorably he may Impress
those with whom he comes In contact,
how much zeal he may exhibit in the
performance of his duties, if he lacks this
one requisiteâ Integrity of characterâ the
institution is far better off without him.
It is only as they tend to indicate the
character that the habits,, appearance and
associations of an employe affect tho in
stitution. The man who is cultivating
bad habits, who is indulging himself In
things which hinder rather than help him,
Is not the man who will be found ready
in a time of emergency to bear great re
sponsibility or to overcome obstacles in
the accomplishment of a great work. It
Is the man who has been trained by con
stant self-denial and self-control, and
who realizes that only these habits which
build and strengthen the character are to
be cultivated, who is chosen to accom
plish these difficult missions."â New

ner of Avenue B and Seventh street to
day while trying to prevent a soldier

Adolph Schloss, 22 years of age, of the
Eleventh Battery Field Artillery, station
ed at Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn. After
shooting the policeman the soldier turned
the revolver on himself, but without seri
ous damage. Mulvey was shot in the cen
ter of his forehead, the bullet passing en
tirely through his skull and out at the
back of his head. Schloss was arrested
Immediately.- His sweetheart, Louise
Freedman, 18 years old, ran. away,
screaming, after the shooting, but was
found later.
She said that her father -wished her
three older sisters to marry first and she
had therefore broken her engagement
with Schloss, who shot at her after she
had refused to renew the engagement.
Schloss has been in the army for two
months and was on leave of absence. He
declared that he had been away four
days over his leave, but said he had no

the defense that he had been terrified into
making these accusations by the police
and disclaimed all knowledge of the af
fair.

In fact, he would not take him at any
price. Lubelski suggested that Loverich
take him and the latter replied that he
might employ Warfleld to take tickets,
but not to entertain his patrons.
Warfield now says he will stick to
plays. "I felt entitled to all the bad eggs
in town before I was half through having
fun with the booking agent," he said,
"but I kept a wary eye on the empty
seats, for fear they might fly over the
footlights at me."
FAMOUS HEBREW CHARAC
TER ACTOR WHO FOOLED A
SHARP BOOKING AGENT.
* Lubelski was the only one in the place
who was net on to the joke. His reputa
*tion as a booking agent was at stake and
he watched Warfield's work critically.
When the latter had concluded his act
he Turned to Lubelski and asked his opin
ion. The critic quickly replied that he
could not dream of giving him $45 a week.
Warfield apologized to Lubelski for
songs without pictures and words
r:lthout music. He said he would like to
Jet $43 a week and board. Lubelski invit
ed him to "make good" and the comedian
eald he would give imitations of Dave
Warfield.
He sang a song about an aged mother
whp stole a horse and was convicted. He
xnaae it up as he went along and ended
Jby striking a dramatic pose and singing
"â¢She was once my mother, boys." He
then told a few Hebrew stories, and his
accent was awful.
Varfield dropped into the Novelty The
â¢ater and watched a number of performers
â¢doing '. their "stunts" for the benefit of
Lubelski, who is a booking agent, and
"Sim Loverich, proprietor of the show
house. Peeling in a jocular mood. War
field turned to Lubelski and asked him if
hÂ» would engage Beerbohm Tree to do a
"turn" and the agent replied that all ap
plicants had to be tried out before being
engaged. Loverich then introduced War
field as "Mr. Williams of New York,"
and "Williams" asked Lubelski for a try
out. Dave did not want to rehearse be
fore a large crowd, so the others were dis
missed. Th.cn the famous actor, who com
mands a weekly salary as large as the
yearly ones of many men, mounted the
stage and. aided and abetted by the piano
player, who knew him, went through a
stunt.
LUBELSKI thinks Dave
II * \Varf.eld is too inferior an actor
Â¦* .11 to shine in vaudeville. Tony had
*"~^ â¢. an alleged sample of Warfield's
work yesterday morning and when
'called* upon to pass judgment threw both
.hands in the air and said, "Rotten."
We have a large number of Infirm old men
in the home, and In his mania Beale was an
likely to attack one as another. He might
have killed tome of them. He was foisted on
us without giving us any warning as to his
habits or the nature of his malady. If it had
not been for the police he would. surely havÂ«
killed me Thursday when he attacked me in
my office. I consider this one of the most
damnable outrages that was ever perpetrated.
The facts of Beale's mental condition
were not explained to the authorities of
the home, but he was not long in the in
stitution before he began to act queerly.
His infractions of the peace were settled
by the home police.
On Thursday, however, he went down
to Yountville, where his wife is stopping,
and presently a telephone message came
to Dr. McAllister, the medical director,
telling him that Beale was having a fit.
Dr. McAllister sent his assistant and sev
eral police down to town and they found
Beale in a state of coma. They carried
him up to the hospital and he soon recov
ered consciousness and made a savage
attack upon Dr. McAllister. He also at
tacked one of the paralytic patients.
Dr. McAllister came to Napa and lodged
a complaint against Beale for insanity.
He was brought to Napa and was exam
ined yesterday before Judge Gesford. As
he was being taken into the Courthouse
he broks away from Deputy Sheriff Hot
tel and tried to attack several . citizens,
among them Assessor Meacham, but they
found safety In flight. Beale Is a well
proportioned man of 285 pounds, and he
gave the officers a lively tight before they
got him handcuffed.
Miss Hanley, the nurse, was one of the
witnesses who testified at the examina
tion. She Baid that she left Agnews Hos
pital for the Veterans'. Home about May
28. and before she left Dr. Leonard Stock
ing, the medical superintendent, told her
that she would have Beale for a patient,
as he was to be sent up to the home-
Miss Hanley asked Dr. Stocking if he
considered the home a proper place for
Beale, for the latter was known as a trou
blesome and violent patient. Dr. Stock
ing thought that it would be all right,
and seemed very much pleased at the
prospect of getting rid of Beale.
Yesterday during the examination Dep
uty Stieriff Hottel called up Dr. Stocking
by telephone and asked him if Beale had
been discharged from the Agnews Hos
pital. Dr. Stocking replied that he had
discharged Beale, not as cured, but at the
request of some of the latter's friends,
who thought pe would be better off at the
home than at the asylum. Dr. Stocking
suggested to Hottel that it would be bet
ter to send Beale to the Napa State Hos
pital than to commit him to Agnews
again, and Hottel promised to convey the
suggestion to Judge Gesford. The Judge,
however, said:
No, they will have to take him back. They
can't foist him off on some other Institution In
this manner. This is one of the most flagrant
abuses of authority on the part of a hospital
superintendent I have ever heard of. That man's I
record chows that he has been an epileptic for
more than forty years, lie was discharged
from the army, after serving but four months,
on account of epilepsy, and he draws a pen
sion of $12 per month for the same disability.
So Beale will go back to Agnews to
day. Dr. McAllister waxed very indig
nant when discussing the case. He said:
NAPA, July 25.â Do the Insane hospitals
discharge troublesome patients In order
to be relieved from caring for them? The
Veterans' Home authorities believe that
this has been done in at least one case
by the Agnews asylum, and that thereby
the lives of the aged and Infirm veterans
have been jeopardized.
On June 15 a young man giving the
name of Peter Donnelly came to the Vet
erans' Home having in charge a veteran
named William B. Beale, who, he said,
was sick and wanted to be admitted to
the hospital. To the hospital steward,
Captain Clarke, Donnelly confided the /act
that he was an attendant, and Beale a
patient, from the Agnews State Hospital,
and that Beale was a hard man to
handle. One of the nurses at the home
hospital, Miss M. J. Hanley, was former
ly an attendant at the Agnews asylum.
Donnelly called on her at the home and
said that he must get away quickly be
cause he was afraid Beale would have a
crazy spell and he would have to take him
back.

City Attorney Lane filed an opinion
yesterday that the Civil Service Commis
sion must certify more than one name in
answer to 1 each requisition for certifica
tion from an elieible list. The-Commis
sion adopted a rule providing that only
the highest name shall be certified.
The Health Board refused to appoint
a plumbing Inspector so certified and
raised the Question that it is entitled to
the certification of more than one name
from which to choose. The City Attorney
holds that by certifying but one name the
commission takes away all right^ of se
lection and itself becomeB in fact the real
appointing power. Lane says that Judge
Sloss' decision in the case of Muller
versus the Health Board should be ac
cepted as determinative of the law and
that the appointing power !s entitled to
the certification of more than one name
from which to choose.
Notwithstanding Lane's opinion Com
missioner Rogers says the commission
will continue to certify the name of the
highest eligible for any appointment.

filed a libel against the California Navi
gation and Improvement Company to re
cover $100,000 damages for the loss of the
steamer Dauntless by being run down by
the steamer Mary Garratt in the San Joa
quin River on August 24, 1901.
The accident occurred ten miles above
Antioch. The complaint alleges that just
prior to the collision the steering gear of
the Mary Garratjt was defective and she
was also overloaded, so that it was im
possible to handle her properly or to steer
her. It Is also alleged that the pilot, mas
ter and crew were "untrained, undrllled
and Incompetent, wholly without skill in
the management of the steamer and the
navigation of the river." and that no look
out or watch was kept on the Mary Oar
ratt. The Dauntless was sunk and bo
came a total loss.

The Board of Public Works held a spe-;
cial meeting yesterday for the purpose of
considering the safety of the cables at the
Junction of Market, Kearny and Third
Btreets, where the Grand Army of the Re
public memorial arch is in course of con
struction. Chairman Casey of the board
took occasion to take Chief Hewitt of the
department of electricity to task for not
filing complete specifications for the work.
Casey assured the Grand Army commit
tee, headed by Horace Wilson, which was
present that the board did raft desire to
obstruct the performance of the work,
but was concerned in the safety of the
public, as the board alone was responsible
for any damages that might result from
Insecure cables or improper splicing.
Hewitt promised to prepare the new
specifications at once, and Casey informed
the committee that work on the arch
would be stopped If considered dangerous.
In the afternoon Officer Beach warned
pedestrians away from the vicinity of
the colonnades.
Though competent engineers agreed
upon the security of the cables, it was
deemed advisable to increase the margin
of safety and additional cables were put
in place last night. This action will re
assure all who had any doubt as to the
security of thÂ« arch In course of con
struction.

Captain Martin says he has not yet lo
cated Northrup but expects to do so
soon.
The specific charge is for embezzling
$19 85 on July 28, 1900. The money was
paid to Northrup by Attorney R. H. Cross
for probate fees. No entry for the receipt
of the money was ever made in the cash
book. The actual amount due for fees
was $18 and when Attorney Cross made a
demand a few days ago for that $1 S5 the
defalcation was discovered.
The District Attorney said there was no
need for issuing the warrant till North
rup was apprehended, but the complaint
had been sworn to and the warrant pro
cured as a precautionary measure, al
though there was a clause In the Penal
Code that prevented the statute of limita
tions from applying to the embezzlement
of public funds.
District Attorney Bylngton instructed
his assistant, Louis H. Ward, yesterday
afternoon to draw up a complaint charg
ing Vernon F. Northrup with embezzling
public funds during the time he was act
ing as deputy County Clerk under Wil
liam A. Deane. The complaint was sworn
to by Detective T. J. Coleman before Po
lice Judge Cabaniss and a warrant was
Issued for Northrup's arrest.

Judge Lawlor's court, was before Judge
Troutt yesterday on an order to show
cause why he should not pay alimony to
Agnes Barbee, his wife, who is suing him
for divorce. The result of the"* examina
tion was the. issuance of an order direct
ing Barbee to pay her $30 alimony, $50
counsel â¢ fees j and $15 costs within five
days.
'Barbee testified that though he was sup
posed to receive $125 a month as Deputy
County Clerk, and signed for that amount,
he only received $75. He refused to state
who got the balance of his salary. Mrs.
Barbee testified that she did not get any
of it.

The refusal of the court entails a heavy
loss upon the plaintiffs, as, according to
their complaint, they have leased the
place for five years at an enormous
rental. They claim that they have agreed
to pay $18,000 for the first year, $36,000 for
the second year and $48,00 for "each of the
succeeding three years.
No promise being forthcoming, the court
notified the plaintiffs that on Friday It
would set the case for trial.
Because B. Ferner and F. J. Drake,
lessees of the notorious Hotel Nymphia,
refused yesterday to promise Judge Mu
rasky that they would not use the prem
ises for Immoral purposes pending. the
trial of ' their suit for an Injunction re
straining the police from Interfering
with them or the occupants of the prem
ises, the court refused to issue a tempo
rary order preventing the police from, en
tering therein as they saw fit.
The. decision came as a t surprlse to At
torneys Miller and Schooler, who repre
sented the plaintiffs,. for It has been the
custom of some of the Judges to Issue
f emporary orders preventing the police
from raiding such places pending a trial
of suits for permanent injunction. It
means that until the case is tried on Its
merits there will be no court interfer
ence with the police.
Murasky, In giving his decision, said
â¢that In view of the fact that the plaintiffs
would not give the required promise he
could not hold otherwise than that they
were not in court in good faith, and that
therefore he could not grant their prayer.
"I will issue the.order," said the court,
"if I am given that promise, otnerwise
you must wait until the merits of the
case are gone into."
The principal heirs of Mrs. Cogswell are
Harry Skellinger, a nephew, who resides
in this city, and Laura Robley. a sister,
and Laura Richards and Elizabeth Rob
ley, nieces, who reside in Connecticut. It
is claimed that Henshaw, accompanied by
Attorney Reed, visited the Eastern heirs
a short time after the death of Mrs.
Cogswell and. taking advantage of their
ignorance of the law, prevailed upon them
to sign the alleged cdntract. He also se
cured Ekellinger's signature, it is said, to
a similar document, but the latter a short
time ago brought an action in Oakland to
have it set aside. The suit is still pend
ing.
Several weeks ago. when the second
contest of Mrs. Cogswell's will, filed by
Alexander O. Richards, was compromised,
the helrÂ« It is said, made a demand upon
Henshaw' that he Institute distribution
proceedings. H* refused, it is declared,
and they filed the petition which was on
yesterday's calendar and which led to the
making of thÂ« charges.
Attorneys Mansfield and J. S. Partridge,
who represent the heirs, claim that Hen
shaw, contrary to the law which provides
that an executor shall not receive for his
services any more than the statutory
fees, has entered Into a contract with the
heirs for 10 per cent of their legacies. For
the extra compensation they say he
agreed to hasten the estate through the
courts. They say he has been guilty of
double dealing and has, instead of living
up to the alleged contract. Illegal though
it Is, delayed matters in order that the
percentage might be increased. The law
allows executors as fees for handling an
estate a percentage on each $1000. For
his care of the Cogswell property Hen-
Fhaw would, under the law, receive about
515,000. The ai.rged contract would bring
him at least $40,000 additional.
The half-million dollar estate of the
late Catherine D. Cogswell seems fated
to become, like many other large estates,
a bone of contention. Though
Mrs. Cogswell died a year ago
last February only it has been the sub
ject of two bitter legal struggles, which
ended in costly compromise, and now
there is in prospect a battle royal be
tween the executor of her will and the
four principal heirs. In fact the battle
commenced yesterday in Judge Troutt's
court, when a hearing of a petition for
partial distribution of the Estate filed by
the heirs was granted. The hearing was
short, but while it was on charges were
made by the attorneys for the heirs that
reflect upon W. G. Henshaw. the Oakland
banker, who Is executor of Mrs. Cogs
well's will. The charges were to the ef
fect that Henshaw. to further his own
ends, and in direct violation of the law,
was obstructing the distribution to the
heirs of their legacies. The charge was
Indignantly denied by Reed & Nusbaumer,
Henshaw's attorneys. They asked for a
continuance of two weeks i however,
claiming that Charles S. Wheeler, who is
associated with them, was unable to ap
pear in court before then, and that for
that reason alone they desired further
time. The court put the matter over for
a week.
Assistant District Attorney Hanley sug
gested that an attachment be issued
against her, but Attorney Low said that
If the case were continued till 1:30 o'clock
he would have her present. In court. This
suggestion was adopted.
Meantime the charge of battery upon
Leopold Jordan, who went at the request
of Mrs. Benham to rescue -the girl from
Hewlett and was struck on the back of
the head by Hewlett, was called. Jordan
was called to the stand and said he did
not wish to prosecute the case. At the re
quest of the Judge he detailed the inci
dents that led jip to the battery upon
him. The Judge dismissed the case.
At 1:30 o'clock Miss Ethel Relbenstein,
accompanied by her father and sister, en
tered the court room. In answer to the
Judge she said she had no desire to prose
cute the case; she had sustained no seri
ous injuries; the defendant did not use
any weapon and she was not rendered
senseless. She had Just been a little bit
excited. The Judge dismissed the case.
As the girl's father left the court room
his eyes lighted upon Hewlett for an In
stant and there was an ugly gleam In
them, but that was all.
The Judge said that she had sworn to
the complaint charging the defendant
with an assault to do grievous bodily
Injury and he observed at the time that
there were no apparent marks upon her
to show that she had been injured, al
though she said that her body wu
bruised.
When the case was called, Attorney
Charles A. Low, who represented the de
fendant, said that Miss Ethel Reibensteln
of Stockton, whom Hewlett was accused
of having dragged from the residence of
Mrs. Benham, 1127 O'Farrell street, to his
rooms at 1124 O'Farrell street about 1
o'clock on Monday morning and of hav
ing choked and otherwise .maltreated
her. was sick from the effects of her ex
perience with the defendant and was un
able to appear in court. Her sister had
told him that she would not prosecute
Hewlett.
Harry Hewlett, cashier of the First Na
tional Bank of Stockton, charged with
battery and assault with Intent to do
grievous bodily harm, has escaped prose
cution. Police Judge Cabanlss dismissed
both of the charges yesteoday, the com
plaining witnesses having, refused to
prosecute him.

Laying aside the pugilistic * end ; of ; it
for the nonce Bob . Fitzsimmons and his
charming, bride are making a. neck and
neck finish of it with the, champion these
days for the admiration of the summer
boarders. The voice of "the talented mem
ber of the "When Johnny Comes March
ing Home" company^' has proved * a 'wel
come addition to the^springs ' talent.' Â¦ Bob
looks as - happy' as . on the occasion when
that Bolar. plexus" punch retired Jim * Cor
bett at Carson, bringing . Fitz : fame ' and
fortune. Bob has his troubles,* too.:-: His
pet gopher. snake is seriously- ill from an
pen from this time on. Brownie,
the poor little mountain bear that caused
a sensation in the sporting world by. help
ing himself to a hunk out of Champion
Jim Jeffries* off leg, "has been- expelled
from the kindergarten class and' in his
solitude appear3.t0.be keenly feeling his
disgrace.
The champion began light work again
Monday and Trainer Billy Delaney says
the big boiler-maker from the land ' of
oranges and steep hotel rates will bo
ready to step into the ring on! August 11,
fit and ready. Manager "Kid" Eagan did
not appear quite so sanguine, but De
laney says Jeff will be on hand if he has
but one leg to stand on.
In sizing up the situation and referring
to Jim Corbett's statement that he would
claim the 52500 forfeit money if a post
ponement were asked for, Delaney said,
"Of course, Corbett would be entitled to
the money and eo would the club, but
there is no need for any anxiety on that
score." Both Eagan and Delaney. ap
peared nettled over Corbett's contention
that Jeffries was endeavoring to side
step the ex-champion. "If our man. is
afraid of Corbett," said Eagan, "why
didn't Corbett sign 'winner to take all..';'!-
In the mind of both manager and. trainer
that seemed an argument strong enough
to preclude any shirking on Jeffries'
part. In all, the champion- has enjoyed
a respite from work of about four : days
and his trainer says it has done ' him
good. Jeffries certainly has not the look
of an invalid or a convalescent. Hla'face
is the picture of health and with the short
runs he will soon indulge in on the road
Delaney claims he will do to ; face any
kind of a battery of ripping upper cuts,
straight lefts or right-hand wallops.
To illustrate that the champion ' is ' rap
idly "setting .back to his feed" he^was
the central figure in a game of. baseball
played in front of, the hotel after dinner
Monday evening. Â¦ Jim's terrific slides be
tween bales have been a' feature
of the game here, but at Trainer â¢ Dela
ney's request he. occupied the pitcher's
box throughout ' Monday night's , contest,
lest the injured limb. might receive a set
back. Judge Quinn' of Emeryville ; picked
files from the clouds that seemed, an im
possibility! : Billy Delaney, on first/looked
for air the world like "Big. Bill' Everett
of the Colorado Springs team.. Mine Host
Jim Hayes held down the "second bag in
a manner that, would set (Hank . Harris
seeking his signature. . Â¦ Dick Adams, a
well known San Francisco hotel man,
made some pickups at short that brought
down the v bleachers. ;Jack- Jeffries han
dled his brother's drops and curves after
the style of Leahy of the Frlscos, while
Fitzsimmons batted as fiercely as - Lajoie
ever did. . ' â

MITIOATINQ EVIDENCE
IN A BATTEBY TBIAL
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, July 28.
Four small boys, all of them less than
ten years of age, tried to steal Thomas
Stevenson's beehive yesterday morning at
Calais and Falrview streets with results
disastrous. The bees, It seems, were
loaded for boys and they weren't partic
ular Into which part of their anatomies
they sunk their fangs. Now the boys'
faces are swollen so that their own
mothers wouldn't know them. Besides
all this agony, as if it were not halt
enough punishment in the way of retri
bution, the owner of the beehive has
sworn to complaints charging them with
malicious mischief.
The boys are Daniel Alden, Eddie AI
den, Joseph Real and Max Lorett, all of
them having homes in South Berkeley.
Eddie Alden conceived the brilliant idea
yesterday of eating the honey; in Stev
enson's beehive, so they fixed it all up
that they would go after It this morning
before the bees got out of bed.
Before 7 o'clock the boys were on the
scene with. a. single horse and wagon,
prepared to grab the beehive and run off
with it. But the bees were right there
with the stings. The boys first tumbled
the cover of the hive over with a long
stick, having counted on the bees taking
to flight as soon as this was done. But
the bees stayed with the honey. Then
the -miscreants tried putting the whole
thing into the wagon and driving off.
By the time they got it.into the wagon,
however, ..they were, covered with bees,
the horse^ was covered with them and
there was a great yelling and screeching.
The boy a kept brushing the beÂ«s off and
the horse made a break to run away.
Just at this Interesting Juncture the
Rev. W. H. Scudder, pastor of the ' Park
Congregational Church, looked out of his
window : and saw -what was going on.
He v knew the hive did not belong to the
boys, so he | ordered them ] to put it back.
Putting it back was an excruciating job,
but the Rev.: Mr. v Scudder was kind
enough to help; them . by giving them
gunny sacks for protection against the
stings. 'â¢:Â¦ . Â¦ . .'.-'. .â¢'Â¦â¢.'.. Â¦; ' '
The would-be robbers . finally retrated
from ; the,' scene* of . their defeat, with no
honey; but lots' of stings. Â¦ Now they wait
in fear 'of the constable, and his little
warrant- '' * " ' ''
ALAMEDA, July 2S.â Members of the
Board of Trade are preparing to call
another mass meeting to discuss the mat
ter of the two applications for local
franchise's asked for by the Southern Pa
cific Company and also the plans of the
City Trustees to bring about a speedy
and satisfactory settlement of the rail
road agitation. Some of the merchants
are understood to be opposed to the ac
tion of the City Trustees In selecting
fifty representative residents and proper
ly owners to advise and confer with them
before the City Trustees take any action
on the applications. Thus far the Board
of Trade and the "West End Improvement
Club have managed the public discussions
of the franchises, but the City Trustees
desire to hear every one who wishes
to express himself in the matter and for
that reason adopted the plan of choosing
men who are heavily interested in Ala
meda and concerned with her welfare.
Thus far this, element among the resi
dents has not expressed itself, and the
City Trustees feel that it should be heard
before any decisive action is taken.
It Is intended by the Board of Trade to
call the mass meeting for the latter part
of this 'week If the necessary arrange
ments can be made.
Since the railroad agitation commenced
some local business men, particularly
those interested in realty and building,
say that It has affected them and created
an unsettled condition in the market.
More than, one person who contemplated
building- has -deferred commencing until
the railroad franchises and agitation shall
have been â¢ disposed of, .one' way or
another.

Heretoforeâ and the same Is practi
cally true of to-dayâ the ranks of femala
"hands" In Japan are recruited from
among the rural population by agents,
who /nduce the country lasses to sign
contracts for quite a number of years
âthe best portion of their lives. And
the wages average about three-pence per
day!
For that miserable mess of pottageâ
about six centsâ girls not only labor hard
during working hours, but permit them
selves to be wholly isolated from the. out
er world, just as If they were In a pris
on, a hospital or In a nunnery. Thus they
are entirely In the power of their employ
ers, the least scrupulous of whom take
an unfair advantage of their helplessness.
Thanks to the initiative of the press and
to the high spirit of a few wealthy firms,
a strong and lurid light has been thrown
upon those dark places of Japan, and
redress Is already .In sight. ThÂ© Man
chester of the Mikado's realm Is Osaka,
and it was the terrible state of things
In vogue in the mills and works of that
city that first attracted attention. The
slaves of the southern states of North
America had a better time than some of
the wretched girls of Osaka, the prod
ucts of whose labor were thrown upon
European markets at nominal prices.
Happily the Guild of Weavers Jias now
set to work to better the lot of these he
lots and Its efforts are being reinforced
by Government employes.
Curiously enough. In the higher call-
Ings and professions that require skill or
scientific, training Instead of mere man
ual labor- there was hardly any field for
woman's activity. Thus, in none of the
ministries of Government offices was a
woman to be found as a clvtl servant.
Xhe respectable firms of merchants like
wise rigidly excluded members of the fair
sex, refusing to employ them as sales
women; only in a few cheap bazaars
where the work was very fatiguing and
the pay utterly inadequate were women
to be seen behind the counter. But here,
too. a beneficial change Is now being
made. The firm of Mitsui, the weavers,
for example â one of the wealthiest In Jap
anâhas Just decided to take on girls.
For a considerable time past women
have been engaged at railway stations,
especially in dealing with passenger traf
fic, and now the Sanul line, which had
hitherto eliminated the female element,
has completely broken with Its traditions,
and in future the passengers by that com
pany's line will be looked after by women
conductors, and perhaps , women con
trollers as well. The Crown Prince of
Japan takes a keen Interest in this move
ment, which alms at making life less mis
erable to his future female subjects, .and
he has begun by setting an excellent ex
ample. He has married but one wife, and
has allowed it to be generally understood
that he is, and intends to remain, a mon
ogamist to the end of his days.â N. Y.

The next structure to be erected In the plans
for the greater University of California will be
the botany building. The drawings are being
prepared by John Galen Howard, supervising
architect of the university. It had been care
fully planned to add an addition to the present
botany building and $7500 was set aside for
this purpose. It was ascertained that before
an adequate addition could be erected $15,000
would have to be expended and the building of
an entirely new structure was then decided on.
The university will soon be asked by a num
ber of the high schools of the State to -demand
that the institutions which seek to be acc>pd-
Ited have a uniform school year. This move
ment has found support among those high
schools which have a full year of ten months,
the argument being that It is unfair to give
recognition to schools giving Instruction for a
shorter period. The proponents of the pro
posed new rule ' are chiefly in Sacramento.
While there has been no organized attempt
thus far to force a declaration from the uni
versity on .the subject. It Is probable that the
matter wjll be seriously considered by the fac
ulty.

-The effort on the part of the Contra
Coeta Water Company to have the 11.500.
000 assessment en Its franchise Btricken
from the rolls of this county was the oc
caEion of much argument before the
â¢"Hoard of Equalization this morning and
was put over again for final decision next
Thursday.
' Attorney Glasccck, for the company,
lasts his hopes of a decision on an opin
ion rendered in the case of the Spring
Valley Water Company against Tax Col
lector Barber of this county, in which de
â¢citiqn the^ court states that "a water
Vompany. whose franchise has been as
i-etsed in the county where it has its prin
, Â«'|paj place of business, cannot be assessed
v.poii. Us franchise for a mere right of
.'.way in another county, through which a
portion cf Its pipe and pipe line passed,
'entirety unconnected with any privilege
granted by said county to take tolls or
! collect water rates, or enjoy any other
special. prerogative. Such mere right of
vay is rot a franchise."
Arrrssor Dalton takes the view that
.while the opinion quoted states that a
Â¦right of way or franchise cannot be a?
fretsed in another county where there is
r.fi distributing Fystem. if there is one
â¢it may be assessed. "If the franchise is
i: # ot assessable in this county we want to
know it," he raid, "that we may have
the fact established by the courts, so that
.'the company can be forced to pay taxes
.on the true value of Us plant in some
county.** v â¢
in regard to the assessment of the fran
chise in San Francisco by Assessor Dodge
Dalton eaid to-day that the explanation
he had received from San Francisco was
to the effect that it was not the franchise
which had been assessed at $300. but that
this was a nominal sum assessed to the
' company for the rigrht to do business in
San Francisco. In former years this priv
ilege hfcs been assessed at $150, but this
ftfT it had been doubled.
The entire matter lies just where it did
art the beginning of the discussion. The
Assessor and "water company are no near
â¢ r a solution of the question, which in
volves legal points that can be dcter
1 mined enly by a court.
The Assessor stated to the board to-day
that he had been Informed that the
. Fprinjr Valley "Water Company would not
. protest the raise of its assessment from
JflW.ftp to $3,310,000. The explanation of
this company's passive acquiescence in
:h* matter is said to He in the fact that
Is trying to show in the San Francisco
courts that Its holdings in Alameda
â¢ County are worth $10,000,000 and any tes
timony to the contrary put in here could
Â»*- used â¢ against It In its case there.
The matter of listening to the argu
ments for and against the raising of the
â¢ sfcsessment of the Oakland Transit Con
solidated frcra $2,000,000 to more than $10,-
W.OOO * was set by the board for next
Thursday morning at 10 o'clock.
Barnes had not long been Jn prison be
fore he was visited by the repentant Mrs.
Hughes. She brought him fruit and flow
en and spent a? much time with him as
the jailers would allow. Then she went to
the District Attorney and asked to have
the case against him dismissed, but^ she
was passed on to the Judge. Several
week? passed without her gaining any
Fatiffactlon. but to-day's developments
showed she had not given up hope. With
Harnes free she could marry him; as his
wife her Hps would be sealed and she
could not testify against him. They went
from .iail to court house, where a mar
riage license was secured, and then sum
moned Justice of the Peace Geary to tie
the knot.
According to attorneys the case against
Barnes has collnnsed.
William E. Barnes, erstwhile prisoner
In the County Jail, was willing to marry
In order to secure his release, even if the
woman In question was talr and 40, while
Mrs. Anna B. Hughes, who was the cause
of his arrest and Incarceration, signified
her willingness to effect his release to
gain a. husband.
She had him arrested for stealing her
watch and purse, but her resentment
changed to tender pity and to-day 6he ef
fected his release bv depositing: a $2000
fcond with Judge Hall and a short time
later was joined to him for life.
Prior to his trouble Barnes boarded at
Mrs. Hughes' home at J110 Jefferson
street. One day In the latter part of
JunÂ» he disappeared and It was alleged
by Mrs. Hushes that he took with him
her purse containing $35 and a gold watch
which she valued at 5200. and with the
money thus obtained went on a three
days' spree in Pan Francisco. He returned
to her house and she had. him arrested.

Revenue Agent Eldridge Dies
j: Lnited States Internal Revenue Agent
Bert M. Thomas was notified yesterday
of the death of United States Internal
Hevrnue Agent E. W. Eldrldge, who pass
rd away at Garrett Park, Maryland, on
July a. after a brief illness, caused by
raraiyeis. Mr. Eldridge was formerly in
charge of 'he United States Internal Rev
rnue agency in this city, and was trans
ferred to the East about seven years ago.
He was an authority on internal revenue
matters and he left a textbook on the
subject that is highly prized.
played her heavily to arrive
and M. A. Newell, the broker, who han
dles nearly all the local reinsurance spec
ulation, was for several hours taking
money as fast as he could count It. When
the British speculators found so much
faith in the overdue vessel and such
ready acceptance of their money at the
advanced odds they acquired a discreet
shyness and the last cablegram received
by Newell from London reduced the rate
tfÂ» 50 per cent.
When the rate went down the play
stopped, but the knowledge that^ San
Francisco speculators are ready 'for a
big plunge on the next advance is hav
ing its effect and yesterday the rate was
further reduced to 40 per cent. The Brew
er Is now out 145 days from Sourabaya
for Delaware Breakwater.
The rate on the Milton Park remains
at 25 per cent.
WHEN the rate of reinsurance
on the Helen Bretver was ad
vanced on Monday morning to
60 per cent local speculators
Superintendents employed by the United
Kallroads were t ailed yesterday by Attor
ney Moore to testify on behalf of the cor
poration to the arbitration proceedings
which are now pending betwem that cor
poration ar.d the Carmen's Union.
They all told practically the same slory, i
anU when cross-examined by Livernash [
they cculd not be shaken. The fact de- |
vÂ«Â»lcpcd that there are quite a number of '
>vung mei 1 employed as motormen an-J I
conductors by the United Railroads who
are at the eair.e time studying to become
doctors and dentists. The superintend
ents testified that these young medical
students were all given early morning and
i evening runs, as far as practical, so that
the work would not interfere with their
lectures or studies. The superintendents
denied that the early runs of theses stu
dents injured in any way the earnings of
the extrame n in the different barns.
The superintendents testified that an ex
traman's wages averaged from $50 to $73 a
month. How- much the men earned rested
a creat deal with the individuals them
selves. Some men the moment they were
through with their work !eft the barn,
while others would remain around seek
ing to make extra trips.
F. F. Allen, one of the superintendents
who pave testimony, said that he learned
how to run a table car in a little over
three days. After that he felt fully com
petent, and the on:y new things he
learned after those three days was the
knack of starting and stopping a car with
less jerks than when he first started in.
Superintendents J. C. Skinner and E. M.
Frank gave testimony corresponding to
Allen's testimony.
Just before the close of the afternoon
session Moore made the confession that
he was beaten on one point. The confes
sion was brought out by a remark by Liv
.*Â«rnash that there was something he
could not quite make out.
"There are lots of things I can't make
out." replied Moore. "Take you, for in
stance. I have MCa you every day for
two months and I haven't made you out '
yet."
The case will be resumed this morning
at TO o'clock.

Commissioner Filcher says that he fa
vors a. wine, structure in the form of a
canopy upheld by many columns and
roofed with bottles 'of wine instead of
tiles. At either end would be placed i
huge wine cask capable of containing
thousands of gallons of wine, and in the
center would be a wine vat large enough
to be used as a sampling-room. The ex
pense to each wine man would be smallâ
probably not mbre than $100 to each ex
hibitor. If desired each vineyard could
have the exclusive occupancy of one co"

affair would be made showy and bÂ« one
of the leading attractions of the big expo
sition.
One hundred and thirty of the leading
wine men of California have been invited
to meet In this city at the rooms of the
San Francisco Chamber of Commerce on
Thursday, August 6, for the purpose of
ascertaining the best way to have Califor
nia wines and brandies exhibited at the
St. Louis Exposition. The invitations for
this conference have been sent out by the
California St. Louis Exposition Commis
sion. Commissioner Filcher says that the
attendance promises to be large and that
Important action Is likely to result.
In the agricultural building at the St.
Louis Exposition there will be central
spaces reserved for special exhibits that
are illustrative of the peculiar resources
of the United States and that arÂ» of
ing Importance. Three large spaces havo
already been allotted to the corn Indus
try. Almost in the center of the great
building, which covers an area of twenty
acres, is a space of large size, Including
In all 4732 square feet, which the wine
men of California can occupy for their
exhibit if they wish and if they are ready
to make the proper move to assure the
management that they will, avail them
selves of the fine opportunity offered to
them to advertise one of the leading In
dustries of the State.

NEW YORK. July 28. â The stock market
this morning showed the continuing effect of
the clearing atmosphere which resulted from
yesterday's and Friday's (allures and the
market became quite generally strong. But
the brighter sentiment over the outlook did not
hold its full force throughout the day. There
was a rather pronounced reaction at the last,
which wiped out the most Important part of
the day's gains and took a few of the grain
carriers a point or more below last night.
New York Central was the conspicuous leader
of the advance, rising at one time 2% over
laft night on buying reputed to "oe of the best
character. The sentimental effect on the mar
ket of the buying of this stock and of Penn
sylvania and the affiliated stocks as well as
of the coalers and of the' high-grade railroad
stocks was considerable. Atchison suffered
most acutely among the market leaders and
its drop to 1% below last night upset the late
market and led the whole list downward. The
grain carriers were not strong at any time
and were presumably affected by the 1 reports
of hot winds In the corn belt and by the
Weather Bureau's weekly bulletin on corn
and spring wheat. Reports of crop damage
were reinforced by the upward movement of
prices in the grain markets and the develop
ment of profit taking in those markets did not
save stocks from the late react kn. The im
proved sentiment this morning was. largely due
to the understanding that the closing out of
hypothecated securities for loans, both of the
failed firms and of others under pressure for
payment of loans on collateral for which the
market Is not active is to be suspended for the
present to await a more favorable market.
Late in the day there was indication of a re
sumption of selling out of collateral In rome
loans. The buying throujrh commission houses
was reported to he better than for many weeks
and was hopefully regarded. But this buying
did not follow the market upward. There was
evidence of a purpose to drive in the bears
In the calling In of stocks loaned for delivery
on short contracts, and in the character of
dome of the rumors which wert set afloat.
There was a report of a private settlement be
tween the Union Pacific Interests and of last
week's failed firms, looking to taking over of
large holdings of Southern Pacific and a re
sumption by the firm. This was denied when
the Union Pacific directors assembled to de
clare the regular dividends. Toledo, St. Louis
and Western was reported to have passed to
Grand Trunk control. An offer of 50 for
Evansvllle and Terre Haute control was al
lered to have been made by an anonymous
bidder. Colorado Fuel was said to have ac
quired the Utah Iron Company and its price
shot up nearly a dozen points on a few; Inter
vening sales Just at the last. The -other sto
ries were effective In varying degree In i*aus-
Ing sharp bidding for the stocks. The renewal
of 'the *teel billet pool seemed to be hopefully
regarded among Iron and steel companies'
shareholders and stocks of that rroup were
quite generally strong. The time money mar
ket was reported appreciably higher and some
long time loans were reported to have been ne
gotiated below Â« per cent. â¢ Sanguine hopes
were expressed of a strong bank statement 1 on
next Saturday. But the obvious fact was that
the demand from the shorts was growing satis
fied and that the Investment was not follow
ing the price In stocks. When traders at
tempted to take profits on the day's rise the
market rave way and closed unsettled and Ir
rerular.
Bonds were strong and higher. Total eales,
par value. >3.4%5.OOO.
United States bonds were unchanged on the
last call.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO. July 28.â After considerable
strength at the start prices in the grain pits
ruled easier and September wheat closed %@
%c lower, September corn and oats were each
%@%c lower, but provisions were strong, the
September products closing from 10c to 15c
higher.
Trading In wheat was active at the be
ginning of the session and opening prices were
strong, with September *Â»@%c highsr at 78%@
78%c. There were a good many buy'ng orders
to be filled at the opening and under this
demand the market was strong the first half
hour and September sold at 78&C. but the
better prices brought out many selling orders
from commission houses and there was also
plenty of general liquidation, which soon
started prices on the down grade. Later in
the session the Belling movement was in
creased under the influence of an Increase of
39,000 bushels in the world's visible and also
by the bearish construction put on tho weekly
Government croo report, and in consequence
the market ruled quite weak. After selling
down to "%c September rallied a) iÂ«Â»htly and
closed at 77%@77%c. a loss of Vi&'isC.
There was a larse volume of trade In corn
and although opening prices were strong the
advance was not maintained owing to heavy
realizing by prominent operators. Private re
ports of rain in Kansas with predictions â¢ of
further precipitation for that State, together
with the rather bearish tone of the weekly
Government crop report, were partly responsi
ble for the selling movement. Late in the
day the selling became more pronounced and
the close was at the bottom, September being
Â»i<ii%c lower at 52Vic, after rangins between
52V4c and 53%c.
Although oats opened fairly firm In sym
pathy with the strength in other grains the
heavy receipts, good grading' and Improved
crop reports caused weakness later In the day
and lower prices prevailed the remainder of
the session. After selling between 33%e and
34c September closed %Â©%c lower at 33%c.
Good buying by shorts caused strength in
provisions at the opening, with general ad
vances in all' products. The strength In grains
end the smaller hog receipts were early In
fluences. Realizing sales caused a loss of
part of the gain. The close was firm, with
September pork up 12%c at $13 02 M.. Septem
ber lard was 10@12%c higher at $7 62%@
7 65 and ribs were ud 12%@15c at $7 50.

COMMERCIAL NEWS
"One very peculiar thing about banking
is that, although a person may have S50Q
In bank, his check for $505 would not be
honored by paying out all the money on
deposit, unless, of course. It was under
stood by the bank that ths depositor
could at times overdraw to a small ex
tentâa check iSypaid for its face value. I
once knew a man who kept a balance in
a bank. He got into some trouble and
gave a check to cover the sum of money
needed. He gave a check for $10 more
than his balance, knowing full well that
the bank would not allow $1 overdrawn.
He thought he could get to the bank In
time to draw out his money before it
could be attached by law, for he knew his
check would not be honored.- But he
reckoned without his host. While the
man to whom the check was given was
waiting for the paper, he inadvertently
saw by the check book that the balance
In bank was $10. less than the amount of
the check. He knew the check would not
be honored at the bank, but said nothing.
He realized that he was 'up against' a
fraud, and determined not to be outdone.
He accepted. the. check, gave a receipt and
bowed his thanks profusely. He hastened
to the bank for his money. Did he pre
sent the check to the paying teller? Nay,
nay. He walked to the desk where the
deposit slips were, made out a deposit slip
for $10 in favor of the man who had given
the check, to him and presented it to the
receiving teller. This, of course, added
$10 to the balance, for any person can de
posit money to the credit of another.
Then he went over to the paying teller
and presented his check. The books
showed the balance $10 \ short of the
amount of the check, but upon inquiry
the receiving teller made entry of the $10
deposit, and the. whole amount was paid.
You never saw a more surprised or more
chagrined man in your life than the man
who gave the check when he came to the
bank a few minutes later, and, upon pre
senting a check for his exact balance, he
was told that there was no balance, as a
check had' just been honored for the
whole amount of his account. Then he
was told of the deposit. He left the bank,
and has never done business with us
since."â Washington Star.
A TRICKSTER OUTWITTED.
"When checks are negotiable and pass
by indorsement and delivery the same de
gree of diligence will be required of each
person to whom they are indorsed, in
order to hold those indorsing them, as is
required of original payees to hold orig
inal drawers of checks. But by putting
checks in circulation the liability of the
drawers cannot be prolonged. They must
be presented within the same time by In
dorsees as by payees.
"The principal case in which losses oc
cur from failure to use due diligence in
the collection of- checks is where the
banks on which they are drawn fail in
the meantime. If the banks continue sol
vent the drawers will remain liable to pay
their checks for months at least after
they are drawn. Presentation and notice
of dishonor will also be dispensed with
where there are no funds to pay checks
and where the banks on which they are
drawn suspend payment before they can
be presented with proper diligence. After
receiving checks they must be presented
for payment unless such presentation
would be useless, before the original
claims can be sued on, for by accepting
checks there is an implied agreement to
use that method of procuring the money
for which they are drawn. /
"After duly "presenting the checks it is
also the duty of the holder, if they are
not paid, to 1 notify the drawers before the
close of the next secular day following
the presentation and dishonor. No par
ticular form of notice is required. 'It may
be written Or verbal.
"Checks must be dated.' If not dated
at all and they do not contain any state
ment as to whom they are to be paid,
they are never payable.- They may be
ante or post dated, as well as. dated on
the day of delivery. By being antedated
they may be made to cover prior trans
actions and in a measure determine the
relative rights of the parties to them, pro
vided that no fraud is Intended or done.
Postdating in the main determines the
date of payment.
"When postdated so as to fall due on
Sunday they are payable on the following
Monday. Checks postdated or maturing
on legal. holidays should be presented the
day before. When postdated checks are
paid before the dates mentioned the
money paid on them can be recovered.
If blanks are left for date the holders of
checks are thereby authorized to insert
the true dates of delivery, but no other
dates, and If they insert other dates it
makes the checks void. Changing the
dates of checks without consent of the
drawers will do the same.
BULE AS TO PBESENTATION'.
"The presumption is that when checks
are drawn funds will be provided at the
banks on which they are drawn to meet
them, but presentation for payment must
be made within a reasonable time. If not
so presented the holders will be charged
with any consequent loss. When persons
receiving checks and the banks on which
they are drawn are in the same place,
they should be presented the same day or
at the latest the day after which they
are received.
"Checks possess a great many advan
tages in conducting business, but it must
be understood they are in nature but or
ders' for the payment of money, and are
payable In the order In which they are
presentedâ that is to say, a man may
pay bills with checks numbered 100, 106.
122, etc., but at the bank, number 100 would
not have precedence over number 122. :
MUST BE DATED. .
"A man may give a check in payment
of a bill' and obtain a receipt, but the ob
ligation is not liquidated until after the
check has been received and paid at the
bank on which it is drawn," said a Wash
ington bank teller this morning. "In
other words, If the check becomes lost,
then the amount, for which It was drawn
still remains. under the control of the man
who owes the bill, although he may not
know it until his account is balanced and
his canceled checks -returned to him. **

FACTS ABOUT
BANK CHECKS
Inasmuch as all boxing 1 contests which
terminate speedily are, as a rule, ended by
this character of coup de grace, the phys
iology of it is of great Interest. A man
struck with any degree of force upon the
mental area of the jaw. although he may
be in perfect physical condition, instantly
collapses and falls to the ground. The at
titude assumed in recovery, which may be
Instantaneous or delayed some minutes.
Is ntbst characteristic. He squirms about,
raises his head and rolls bis eyes in an
attempt to locate himself. He tries to get
on his side and elbow. He endeavors to
rise upon his bands and knees. If he re
gains his feet he staggers like a drunken
man and should he proceed to reopen hos
tilities he Is usually promptly "put out"
by his adversary. The blow is practically
never fatal, the heart's action is never
unduly accelerated, the pulse and respira
tion are normal, the pupils are normal,
there is no headache, no sweats, no cold
extremities, no pallorâ none of the ordi
nary signs of shock or concussion.
James O. Duncanson (British Medical
Journal, April 4, 1303) believes the condi
tion to, be due entirely to a shaking uf
of the endolymph in the semi-circular
canals. When the blow is administered
there is a violent overtwisting of the head,
which is held in its anteposterior position
by muscles which, compared with those
inflicting the blow, are small and puny.
The result Is that the head files around
with a jerk and the fluid in the canals is
subjected to a greater disturbance than
by any other trauma. There is little rea
son to doubt that this is the Interesting
pathology of the well-known but little un
derstood coup de grace. â Medical News.

Arrested on* Serious Charge.
United States Marshal John Shine ar
rived from Lake County last evening,
having in custody Edgar Burke, a 16-year
old lad who is accused of havine at
tempted to "burglarize" the postofflce at
Lakeport. The youth was locked up at
the City Prison and will be taken before
Commissioner Heacock to-day. It Is al
leged that Burke attempted to enter the
Government building by boring holes
through the floor and was discovered at
work under the structure by the Sheriff.
It is understood that owing to his youth
he will be committed to some reform
school. The United States officer while
In Lakepovt also arrested Dr. H. O. Brent,
accused of sending obscene matter
through the mails. The medico was re
leased, however, upon $2000 bonds.
Sustains Fractured Skull.
Charles Kostering. an employe of Dyer
Bros? at 360 Second street, met with inju
ries last night which may result in his

when In some manner the lever which he
was operating slipped and struck him on
the head. He was rendered unconscious
by the blow and removed to the Harbor
Emergency Hospital In the ambulance.
An examination by the physicians In
charge developed the fact that he had
sustained a fracture of the skull. He was
subsequently taken to the Central Emer
gency Hospital, where an operation was
performed. Kostering Is a married man
and resides at 900 Michigan avenue.

Dr. Jordan declined to submit to an in
terview last night anent Mrs. Jane Stan
ford's recent statement regarding the
Ross controversy: He ' expects to go to
Palo Alto to-day.
Professor Jordan left his party at Sltka,
where they will continue the work until
the fall. Observations will be made by
men who have been stationed along the
coast and through this method it is ex
pected that some valuable data will be
obtained and will bÂ© incorporated In the
report which he - will make to the Gov
ernment.
In our dredging many beautiful marine speci
mens were brought to light and twenty new
species of fish were discovered. The worst
thing that ever happened to the salmon Indus
try In Alaska was the early barricades placed
In the â¢ streams. They were . removed by the
Treasury Department six or seven years ago.
We discovered many interesting facts along
this line. We found that the sockeye salmon
go farthest out to sea, while the silver salmon
go the least, although' no salmon go very far
from shore. Up the Yukon River the sockeyes
go as far as Caribou Creek, 2250 miles from the
ocean. Â¦
â¢ Besides the purely commercial object of
perpetuating the salmon the party had
another, -that of studying the life and
history of the salmon, of which the pro
fessor says little is known, and he added:
IJJE OF SOCKEYE SALMON.
GOVERNMENT AID NEEDED.
I was sent out 'to report on the steps that
must be taken. I have established these two
facts, and after a thorough Investigation of
every available place for a â¢ hatchery I shall
report three places where they should be es
tablished In Alaska. . Â¦
In support of his contentions for Gov
ernment hatcheries Professor Jordan cited
the fact that the packers' association
has maintained two hatcheries 'in Alaska
for several years, one at Karluk and tha
other at Loring, both of which have done
much good, for the industry in the north.
What Is most needed is encouragement
of the 'propagation of the sockeye sal
mon. - i'^i',1
Professor David Starr Jordan cf Stan
ford University, who for the last two
months has been studying the fishery
conditions in the north, returned last
evening and is registered at the Occi
dental Hotel. As a representative of the
United States Fish Commission he was
sent north with a party of experts in
the revenue cutter Albatross, mainly for
the purpose of "Investigating the salmon
hatcheries in the Alaskan waters, and
will make a report upon the results of
his observations to the Federal author
ities. Although he Is not prepared to
state Just what his report -v!ll contain
Dr. Jordan's remarks indicate that it will
include a strong suggestion of the neces
sity for the immediate establishment of
hatcheries. Upon this subject he said:
The key to the whole situation Is hatcheries.
Thus far the nockeye salmon Industry has not
been badly overdone and can be perpetuated by
hatcheries. Another fact our efforts established
if that the work must be done. by the United
States Government. There are . few places In
all Alaska -where hatcheries can be placed and
we cannot ask canneries to maintain them,
therefore the Government must do it. .

wood, but their efforts were futile. The
Coroner was notified and the deputies
went to the house and upon learning the
cause of death allowed the body to re
main. In the afternoon the Coroner's jury
visited the house and took a view of the
remains and examined the room where
the deceased had taken his life.
Mr. Hey wood was 66 years of age. He
was in the habit of rising: early each
morning and taking a bicycle ride
through the park. He failed to put in
an appearance yesterday morning and
Mrs. Woodward went to his room looking
for him and noticed the odor of escaping
gas. She opened the bathroom door and
found him sitting in a chair with the
tube In his mouth. Although greatly
frightened she Instantly gave the alarm.
Deceased was apparently in the best
bodily health up to the time of his death.
The only reason that can be ascribed for
his act is that he was suffering from aber
ration of mind. It is said he had lately
suffered lapses of memory and he feared
his reason was leaving him. On one occa
sion, it is said. Mr. Hey wood could not
remember his place of business and was
found wandering aimlessly on the water
front. On another occasion he was un
able to tell where he had been during the
day. Mr. Heywood recovered from these
attacks and attended to his business.
I^ast Sunday he visited his wife and
adopted daughter, who are in Santa Cruz,
and on his return expressed himself as
being in splendid health.
Mr. Heywood was president of the
Gualala Mill Company and had large lum
ber interests In Mendocino County. Hi3
fortune is estimated at J200.000. He came
to this city in 1S50 and was identified with
big business enterprises. He was also
well known in commercial circles and the
news of his tragic death has caused a
sensation.
his bathroom with one end of a
rubber tube in his mouth and the other
end attached to an open gas jet. Life
seemed already extinct when he was dis
covered by Mrs. Woodward, the house
keeper. C. M. Hunt, a brother-in-law of
the deceased, was called and he telephoned
for Drs. Brune and Carpenter. The physi
cians labored a long time over Mr. Hey-

capitalist who lives at 1430 Hayes
street, ended his life yesterday by
inhaling gas. He was found in
A motion to the effect that the Board of
Police Commissioners should hereafter
reject all applications to open new sa
loons was put and seconded. A vote was
taken. Howell and nutton stood to
gether, but Drinkhouse refused to vote
aye, yet, without hi.v sanction, the major
ity prevailed and the edict went forth.
Finally an application came in to open
a. new saloon. Immediately Commissioner
Hutton objected. When asked his reason
hÂ«* stated that there were a sufficient
number of retail liquor houses in San
Francisco and that he proposed to tol
rraie no more. He said that established
houses should be given an opportunity to
earn interest from their investments and
that the overcrowding of the city with
f^aloons could result in good to no one.
The liquor traffic, he said, had already
exceeded its bounds and that it was the
duty of himself and associates in the
commission to adopt a positive rule by
which it could be regulated.
Hutton said that there were 3102 saloons
in the city. An Increase over this num
ber would certainly mean disaster to
all concerned and he called upon Howell
and Drinkhous* 1 to support a motion that
in future the board should refuse to
grant licenses to new applicants.
There was some discussion over the
matter. Commissioner Drinkhouse was
not in favor of the measure and so ex
pressed himself. Hutton Insisted and
Howell stood by him. Secretary Cadwal
acier was called upon for a report on the
number of saloons and it was found that
In one block on Pacific street there were
but two places of business that did not
pell liquor. In the Mission district some
blocks have as many as twelve or four
teen saloons and the same is the case in
the section north of Market street.
The ill effects of the grocery and bar
trade was emphasized. The hundreds of
dollars expended by workingmen for beer
and whisky that should be contributed to
wives and children was one of the strong
est arguments Commissioner Hutton
made.
Oily three Commissioners were present
when the board convened at the Hall of
Justice. Drinkhouse presided and Hutton
and Howell occupied their regular seats.
Little business was transacted an,d the
Â¦usual crowd of saloon men and attorneys
Â¦were absent. The long rows of benches
in the rear of the room, usually crowded
with anxious applicants, were vacant.
Xc one lingered in the corridors and po
licemen who had been detailed in charge
of the expected crowd were recalled and
bjsi Igned Â¦ to regular duty.
For the -first time in years the custom
ary throng of liquor men who desired
either to renew their licenses or to ex
plt:n away their faults had no occasion
to eppear. But a single man asked for a
transfer from one place of business to
another.
An edict went forth from the Police
Commissioners last night that no new
BaJ or.s shall oj>en in the city of San
Franci6co. It was the result of Commis
sioner Huttons suggestion. He called the
attention of the board to the 1 fact that at
the present time there are 3102 retail liquor
houses within the precincts of the muni
< ipallty and that their supply was suffl
rlent to quench the thirst of the most
thirsty traveler and keep the inhabitants
in cood cheer.

The story of Captain Howard's persist
ent efforts to enlist the capital of San
Francisco parties has already been traced.
But there is a pitiful shadow behind the
story In the shape of letters from the
wife and daughter whom Captain Howard
had left behind him In Victoria. Their
letters tell of bills piling up which could
not be met, of absolute necessities of life
denied them and of the mortifications
born of penury.
Among the- dead man's papers arc a
paid-up policy of the Phoenix Insurance
Company for $1000 and a bankbook show
ing a deposit of $170 In the Victoria branch
of the Bank of Montreal. These are all
the evidences shown" that the man who
met his end in West Berkeley left his
family the means wherewith to buy
bread.
By the papers of the dead man it is
shown that on Ma.rch 22, 1901, George S.
Clay, the New York attorney who watch
ed the interests of Captain Howard, sub
mitted the purchase of a half interest in
the concession to Frank Gould, the capi
talist. This first venture was set to the
price of $50,000. It failed. Next followed
the disastrous dealings with the corpora
tion headed by Daniel Cohalan of New
York, in which the mining expert, George
T. Taylor, acted as the agent by whom
Captain Howard believed he was defraud
ed. After this Captain Howard tried
to enlist the interests of William
Wainwrlght, general assistant and
comptroller of the Grand Trunk
Rrailway, but again failure greeted
him. H. H. Grotschle, a mining
expert of Alaska, showed a fleeting in
terest, as attested by several letters. He
said the concession was rich, but he went
no further. '
If ever the last mysterious chapter in
the history of Captain Thomas Howard
of Victoria can be added to the tale of
the life which came to Its terrible end be
hind Brennan's barn in West Berkeley on
the night of July 17, there will be com
pleted a story as tragic as a Hugo classic.
At present the sinister climax which re
mains veiled in mystery darkens all the
previous events in the sad life history of
the gallant old soldier and gentleman.
From the tell-tale papers left behind,
there can be gathered the pitiful recital
of Captain Howard's determined pursuit
of a glittering fortune, which, like the
will-o'-the-wisp, led him on and on over
hidden pitfalls until at last he was en
gulfed in the dark tragedy which occur
red in the lonely Berkeley surburb. Yet
by the letters of those who should know.
Captain Howard was hibued with the be
lief that his 1600 acres of mineral land on
Indian River in Alaska was all that his
fondest hopes imagined and he never gave
up hope.
It was from the land office of the Canad
ian Government that Captain Howard
gained the concession on the Indian River
in 1901. Before that time he had lived for
several years in retirement after an act
ive life as a soldier and politician. With
the advent of this golden dream the
clouds began to darken until they have
at last engulfed their victim in a mist
of mystery.
