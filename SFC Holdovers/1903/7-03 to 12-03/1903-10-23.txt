LONDON, Oct. 22.â Many lives were
lost In a railway accident this evening
at Sowerby bridge, in the West Riding
of Yorkshire. An express train running
from Leeds to Manchester was thrown
from the track in the tunnel by striking
a detached locomotive which for some
unexplained reason was in the tunnel and
both tracks were obstructed by wreckage.
Meanwhile an express train, from Man
chester for Leeds,- entered the tunnel at
high speed and almost Instantly crashed
into the obstruction, badly wrecking It
sclf.
The tunnel Is filled with a huge mass
of shattered locomotives and coaches and
the work of clearing it away Is neces

WASHINGTON, Oct. 22.â
Five United States Senators, as
manv members of the House of
Representatives and a large num
ber of employes of the Land Of
fice are involved in the land frauds
which have been unearthed , by
agents of the Interior Department
and the secret service in Western
States, according to the informa
tion received by Secretary Hitch
cock. The Secretary declines to
discuss the frauds until he has had
full reports of the agents, who
have just completed their investi
gation. He does not deny the ex
tremely serious allegations which
the report will contain against
High officers of the Government.
Secretary Hitchcock has had
personal charge of the work of
running down the frauds. The
actual work was in charge of A.
B. Pugh, attorney for the Interior
Department, while the secret ser
vice men were undety-the. direction
of W. J. Burns. Pugh and-Burns
are now on their way to Washing
ton, and it is expected that the
Secretary of the Interior will be-
gin criminal proceedings against
those involved in the frauds
within a few weeks.
Whether the position and polit
ical influence of the Senators and
Representatives involved will be
sufficient to protect them from
prosecution remains to be seen.
Some of them, it is alleged, actual
ly profited by the land frauds and
are actively interested in the ring,
which had ramifications in Cali
fornia, Oregon, Washington and
other Western States.
Secretary Hitchcock hopes not
only to send the ringleaders in the
fraud to prison, but to restore to
the Government millions of acres
of valuable timber land which has
been obtained* by fraud.

ST. JOHN, New Brunswick, Oct. 22.â
The Conservative newspapers in Eastern
Canada say that the Alaska boundary

Some of the papers declare that Cana
dians are to blame for the decision un
favorable to Canada and they place the
responsibility upon the government at
Ottawa for permitting the boundary
question to be arbitrated, in view of
what is. termed the anti-Canadian make
up - of the commission. Little fault is

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22.â The isthmian
canal question will make its appearance
In Congress almost immediately after the
extra session begins. While the President
has confined his call to Cuban reciprocity,
there is no limit on the power of Congress
to consider any question that may be in
troduced. The Republican leaders will
not dodge the canal Issue, but will try to
prevent any action taking the canal ne
gotiations out of the President's hands or
instructing him as to his duty and power
under the Spooner act.
Senator Morgan has announced that be
will introduce a resolution of inquiry, as
to the fate, of the treaty negotiated with
Colombia, last - January if the' President
fails to give that information in his mes
sage. -The 'President will give the Infor
mation that the treaty was not ratified
within the prescribed time of eight
months from the date of signature. There
will be no pretense that It is -not dead,
but the President does not consider that
he must at once accept the alternative
and negotiate for the Nicaragua route.
He haa consulted several Republican
leaders who were responsible for canal
legislation, among them Senator Spooner,
the author of the bill which passed, and
they have advised him that" he should
take a ' reasonable time j to consider
whether the Panama canal is impossible
before he turns, to the Nicaragua route.
Should Congress adopt a resolution in
terpreting, the phrase "reasonable time,"
and instructing the President to negotiate
for the Nicaragua route, he will do so,
and be relieved .to have Congress assume
the responsibility. .. : ';?-.â¢Â¦Â¦
Senator Morgan and other advocates of
the Nicaragua route will try to have
Congress adopt such a resolution. There
will be a vigorous debate, which will
cover much ground, but wllf especially
deal with the "reasonable time" to elapse
before the President is required to aban
don Panama and take up the Nicaragua
route. This debate will.be in the Senate,
and, as the Republicans there were re
sponsible for the change from the Hep
burn ;biirto! the, Spooner bill, they are
confident ' that â¢ there will be no new in
structions given' to ; the President.
The House will not have to deal with
the question at once, for there will be no
committees until' the Speaker < names
them, and even then, under the House
rules, the Speaker can control the situa
tion and prevent, any consideration of the
canal questlonuntilsuch time as he shall
elect to have It brought. forward..
"Now," said Sir Mackenzie, "the United
States will command Fort Simpson, la
every case Canadian Interests were sac
rificed."
Senator McMullen said that the decision
would create as much dissatisfaction in
Canada as there was In the Transvaal and
in Ireland.
The Colonial Office expressed Its regret3
and urged the acceptance of these gentle
men rather than the breaking off of nego
tiations. Chamberlain asked Canada'.)
consent to this, but, apparently without
waiting for that consent to be given. Sir
Michael Herbert, for Great Britain, and
Secretary Hay, for the United States,
signed the treaty. There was nothing for
Canada to do then bu^protest and agree.
In the Senate to-dfy Sir Mackenzie
Bowell, leader of the opposition, asked for
Information concerning the Alaska boun
dary award.
Scott, for the Government, replied that
the most important reason why the Cana
dian commissioners did not approve o!
the award was that it was not a judicial
decision. Lord Alverstone had In the
first instance agreed that the center of
the Portland canal should form the boun
dary line. The four islands should have
gone to either the one country or the
other, depending upon the position of the
line through the Portland channel, but
Lord. Alverstone deflected the line so as
to throw two of the islands Into the Unit
ed* States and two into Canada.
Sir Mackenzie Bowell said that It wai
unfortunate that in every case when ne
gotiations have taken place between the
United States and England, where Canada
was affected, the United States' dlplomau
had succeeded In securing islands whicn
commanded most important points of the
Dominion. There was the island right op
posite the harbor of Port Arthur. la
case of difficulty, he said, that island
would have to be secured by the Britten
people, for, if fortified, it would command
the entrance to that harbor. Unless that
was done the United States could secure
It, and with the guns they had at pres
ent, would be able. to destroy the whole
connection between east and west. It
was the same with the island of San
Juan, another secured by treaty negotia
tion.
and Turner were appointed by the United
States.

MINNEAPOLIS, Oct. 22.â The Minneap
olis Cold Storage Company has filed a pe
tition In bankruptcy and John Kunz has
been appointed receiver. The total Hbili
tles may reach $400,000, while the assets
are about $260,000. It is said the company
has been handicapped by the lack of
working: capital. The company probably
will be reorganized. The slump In the
Eastern butter market Is assigned by
Vice President McMullen as one of the
causes t>f the failure.
The principal creditors are the Kunz Oil
Company, of which Receiver Kunz is a
member, the Iowa Dairy and Separator
Company and A. I* Flanders. The prtn-^

buying cream from farmers and making
it into butter.

Some weeks ago I received tha letter from
Fresno. It suggested that he murder a cer
tain wealthy man and that I draw up a. will
leaving the estate to both of us. Aftev I had
read the epistle I was surprised and, as quickly
as possible, I turned it over to Captain of De
tectives Martin, requesting him to notify the
Fresno authorities. The communlcattpn seemed
Illogical and appeared to have been the work
of a crazy man. Its language denoted, insanity
and I rave tt little heed. As a precaution I
did notify the police, fearing, that Metcalf
might commit some act of violence and that I
should be held responsible for it If I did not
notify thft authorities.
The utmost secrecy has been maintained
by the police departments of this "fcity
and Fresno to prevent" the inside facts
from becoming public .regarding, the ar
rest of Metcalf and his associates.
Attorney Sanderson " was interviewed
last night regarding the case and made
the following statement:
Metcalf carne to my office several months
apo. He was Bent by friends who desired to
Joke with me. lie consulted me regarding an
itnposrlble case and as quickly as I could I grot
r:i of him and allowed the matter to drop.
Shortly before September 1 Metcalf came to
my office and said that he declred euf ticlent
moner to go to San Jose. I cave him what
hf> wanted and I supposed he' arrived , at his
stated destination.
Since his imprisonment Metcalf has
made a clean breast of- the .affair and
threatened revenge on the man who be
trayed him to the San, Francisco police.
The first accomplices of Metcalf have dis
appeared and Chief,.Mprgan has. notified
the local department to keep a close
watch for them.
.By diligent inquiry Chief Morgan
learned that Metcalf had planned to mur
der Sibiey on the night of October 6. The
criminal had waited in vain for a reply
f rom Sanderson' ' at San Francisco. The
fact that the letter he had written to
Sanderson had been submitted to Captain
Martin was unknown to him. Two of his
supposed accomplices were shadowed,
and one of them confessed. He told how
on September 1 the residence of Sibiey
v.as burglarized and die small safe taken
away. Metcalf and the other suspected
accomplices were partners in the job.' He
â¢told Chief Morgan of the contemplated
raid on October 6. Both accomplices
promised to remain until the final job
was attempted. All this Information was
contained in a letter from Chief Morgan
to the Chief of Police of this city.
According to advices from Fresno re
ceived by the Police Department of this
city, the two accomplices evaded the sur
veillance of Chief of Police Morgan and
disappeared the day before the contem
plated crime. â¢ Metcalf persevered and se
cured the assistance of two other .men.;
At noon on October 6 the conspirator:
appeared at the home of Sibiey,-. which Is.
Jn the extreme western part of "Fresno."
Elbley was away and the three burglars,
instead of murdering the old man, . as
contemplated. merely ransacked ' the
premises. Chief Morgan and Policeman
Hartlgan were secreted In the back yard
and when the marauders emerged from
the house they overpowered them. Met
calf fought like a wildcat, but was finally
subdued.
Acting on advices from Chief of Police
Wittman of this city, the authorities of
Fresno have placed under arrest Arthur
Metcalf, a saloon loafer and all round
hard character of that place, and J. Ga
brlef.and J. Jordan, charged with being
accomplices* in a burglary.
About four weeks ago Captain of. De
tectives Martin was Interviewed by At
torney YVV "W. Sanderson, candidate on
the Democratic ticket for City Attorney
for the City of San Francisco. The at
torney chewed him a letter signed by
Albert Metcalf, dated at Fresno, in
which the offer was made to create San
derson a eharer in half of the proceeds
if he would draw up a will making Met
calf the sole legatee of the property of
William Sibiey, an aged resident of
Fresno, who from his lonely life and the
habit of keeping a small safe in his
house had gained the reputation of being
a wealthy miser.. In the letter it was pro
posed that the signature of Sibiey be
forged. The hints of violence were va^ue,
but evident, and Chief of Police Wittman,
to whom the matter was submitted at
once, telegraphed Chief of Police Morgan
of Fresno the contents of the letter, and
warned him to keep a lookout for a pos
sible murder.

The Denver is the only one of her class
contracted for 17 knots, all the others be
ing required to make 16.5 knots.
BOSTON, Oct; 22.â The second-class
protected cruiser Denver was given her
official trial tripvon the Cape Ann. course
to-day,* but failed to maKe ; the -. speed
called for In her contract. . Commander
Cowles * of the trial board gave out 16.28
knots, as, the average epeed made by the
cruiser during the day's run over ', the
measured course, while her contract calls
for 17 knots per hour for four consecutive
hours. Tidal corrections may help the
cruiser out a little, but will. not bring her
up to the required speed.
The Denver began her race against time
at 10:48:22 this forenoon, when she blew
her whistle and crossed the starting line.
She passed the Baltimore, -marking the
northern end of tho course,' at 12:47:36,
making the elapsed time for the 33 knots
1 hou/ 69 minutes and 14 seconds, and giv
ing her the average speed of 16.606 knots
per hour.
Turning a wide circle, the cruiser head
ed back for the starting line, but Just be
fore she repassed the Baltimore the pis
ton rod on j a low pressure rotary en
gine connected with the circulating
pump broke_ and the vessel had to be
slowed down for repairs. -Â¦'-'.
Af ttr twenty minutes' delay the pump
began working again, and the Denver
headed back to the southward over- the
course. . She went by the Baltimore at
2:03 and ran. into a stiff southwest wind
and quite a Jumpy sea. How much effect
these conditions may have .had on the
speed of the vessel could not be calculat
ed, but it could not have been anything
of great importance. The leg was finished
at 4:12:11, making the elapsedftlme for the
thirty-three knots 2:04:09^, and her aver
age speed on the southern leg 15.27 knots
an hour and her average speed per hour
for the whole course 16.28 knots. . â¢ ;
Members of the trlal % board did not care
to express an opinion as to the cause of
the slowness of the cruiser, but President
Seddinger of the shipbuilding * company
was told that another trial may be given
the vessel in a month or so. /

tive by six men has stopped all traffic for
twenty miles south of Janesville.

news that the artesian well being drilled

NEW "FORK, Oct. 21â Letrta Nixon oc
cupied the witness stand again to-<3ay at
the hearlnc of the United States Ship
building Company and gave much valu
able testimony concerning the general af
fairs cf The corporation. He testified that
he had opposed the Sheldon reorganisa
tion plan and had as a counter proposition
urged that the stock be assessed In or
der to raise the amount necessary to save
the combination from default and bank
ruptcy. His plan for assessment was op
posed by Charles M. Schwab, holder at
that time- cf ttOfiOOfiM of the stock, who,
according to Nixon, declared that thÂ«
stockholders would not pay the assess
ment.
Schwab, so Nixon swore, declined to
pot up any more unless the Bethlehem
bonds were given preference as a lien j
upen the shipbuilding plants to the first
mortgege bonds.
Nixon's testimony also dereloped the
fact that there wes a wide discrepancy
as to the estimated earnings In letters
written by Treasurer Gary to the mem- j
bers of the reorganization committee. !
Samuel Untermcyer. counsel for the bond
holders, asked If it did not show that
there had been an attempt to minimize
the value cf the shipj-ards and magnify
the value of the Bethlehem plant, but
the witness would not cay so.
Much time was taken up In an unsuc
cessful effort to get at the history of a
mysterious check fcr CjO.QOO found at the
Trust Company of the Republic. It was
drawn to "Louis Nixon or ourselves" on
the same date the checks were made out
for the payment cf the cash given to the
vendors for their plants and properties.
Nixon swere that he had never seen the
check before and that he knew nothing
at its history. Both &Ides disclaimed
knowledge of Its history and tie destina
tion of the emcunt of money for which
It was drawn, and the only explanation
frcm any source was that it had simply j
been put through the banks by the Trust
Company cf the Republic The effort to
eet the history of the check will bÂ« re
newed later in the hearing.
Nixon testified that he know as early
as last April that unless the combina
tion could get some money from the Beth-
Ifhem property or elsewhere It must fall.
and warned his associates on the direc
torate that they must husband their re
sources. It was brought out oa cross-ex- I
amination that the share of promotion I
profits ect eside for Schwab, of which i
Nixon told yesterday, had never been paid. I
Ncse of the commitments on account of
promotion were paid. 10 Nixon testified.
The hearing will go en to-morrow after
noon and at the close probably will bÂ«
edjourned fcr ten days on account of eet
engagements of counsel. This adjourn- I
meat probably will prevent the taking of i
the testimony of Schwab and Paa until I
eome time week after next. '

PARIS, Oct. 22.â The first Important de
bate in the Chamber of Deputies to-day
resulted in a victory for the Government.
Premier Combes demanded that the inter
pellations, of which there are* many, on
the subject- of religious congregations, be
united with those on the general policy
of the Government, and the religious in
terpellations were withdrawn. The oppo
sition speakers. MM. Gauthier and Dan
zite. dwelt chiefly . on the recent strike
riots at Armentleres and Honnebont, re
proaching the Government for not taking
measures to prevent disorder, to maintain
liberty to work and for not ordering the
troops to interfere until houses had been
pillaged and burned.
The Premier replied that the Cabinet
had determined to govern with the entire
Republican party against the reactionary
coalition. - â¢
Referring to the situatipn at Armen
tieres, he said there had been plenty of
troops there" and the fact that no action
was taken was due to the' military com
manders. The civil authorities had neg
lected no precautions.
The Government intended, the Premier
continued, to carry on the war against
the congregations, as well as a war of
free thought against slavery of the Intel
ligence.
In conclusion, M. Combes announced
the Government's intention to repeat the
Falloux law, thus finally destroying con
gregational education. The Chamber
voiced its unqualified confidence by a vote
of 332 to 233.

"When Judge Stoddard asked the witness
If Bennett had ever made any Investment
for him, Bryan replied that he had made
Investments of the Commoner fund, buy
ing Government bonds with the proceed
of the subscriptions which came in ad
vance. He also said that Bennett had
never made an lnvesMnent for Mrs.
Bryan.
Lawyer Newton then asked Bryan:
"Was it ever suggested by yourself or.
Mrs. Bryan that he give you the J50.CC0?"
"No, sir, we never suggested It. It
came as a surprise to U3 when Bennett
made the suggestion himself."
James D. Dewell, a wholesale grocer,
stated that for many years he had
known Bennett. Bennett, he said, ap
peared to be ln good mental condition at
the -time he last saw him. which was
shortly before his death.
Bryan then made a statement which
somewhat modified his answer that no
money had been Invested for Mrs. Bryan
by Bennett. He said that when he re
ceived the royalties on his book, "Tho
First Battle," he gave Mrs. Bryan, who
wrote the biographical sketch, a sum
amounting to $4000. This was invested for
her, he said, but he could not recall
whether It was by Bennett or by a Chi
cago firm.
The case was adjourned until Monday
evening.
The witness was next asked why he had
received 1300 from Bennett at the lime
the will was drawn and he stated that
while there was nothing said about It. ha
supposed It to be for drawing up the doc
ument.
NEW HAVEN, Conn.. Oct. 22.â William
J. Bryan again occupied the witness

tion of Bryan. Judge Stoadard. counsel
for Mrs. Bennett, the widow, spent con
siderable time in questioning Bryan why
it was that in the letter which was lelt
for Mrs. Bennett by her husband direct
ing her to give Bryan VjO.000 for himself
and family it was not stated that a cer
tain part of the fund was to be given to
Mrs. Bryan and part to the children.
Bryan replied that he did not know, but
that It was so understood between him-,
self and Bennett and that after Bennett's
death he told Mrs. Bennett about the ar
rangement.

The colony brought, suit to recover the
difference In a price at which they had
contracted for, the crop of grapes and
the price at which the defendants sold
them. Purrington refused to deliver the
grapes to the plaintiff, alleging there was
a verbal agreement, by which he was to
have the benefit of any rise in the market
price of grapes in 1902. The price did
raise, and when the plaintiff refused to
give the advance over the contract price
with "PiirrinKtbri, $24. per ton, the latter
disposed of. his crop elsewhere. He sold
a portion of the crop for $28 50 and the
remainder for $30, making a difference of
$444. ; The, plaintiff sought to recover this
sum, but % was only awarded a dollar. A

It Is shameful that persons in the pay
of the Government should be allowed to
circulate foul libels on citizens, but after
on experience of thirty-one years in this
business I think my reputation will with
stand any such attacks. F. A. HYDE.
Under the present policy of the Land
Office, special agents are swarming all
over the United State; at enormous ex
pense to the Government, and they may
send as many of them out here as they
please to work on my land business the
rest of their natural lives. I know the
law, and know what I can and what I
cannot do legally. I am used to the
methods of these special - agents, and I
pay but little attention to them. If they
wish to intimidate me, I would suggest
that they take up some case that is not
as aged as the one they have in hand,
and especially something in which the
United States Is a party, for these special
agents- have no more business investi
gating the methods by which the States
sell their school lands than they have to
investigate the validity of transfers of
titles to city lots. . .

Fourth â It Is alleged that these pur
chases of lands in Oregon were made in
anticipation of their being included in
forest reserves, and that a combination
was formed between the San Francisco
rirg and certain State and Federal of
ficials to fix the boundaries of such re
serves and secure their adoption by the
Interior Department.
Answer â The facts are that the Cascade
Range Forest Reserve was created in
1&S3. the forest lieu land law was passed
In 1837, and my purchases of land there
occurred in 1S98, over five years ago.
Since then I have done no business there
of any kind. All of the large reserva-i
tions on this coast were' crtated prior to j
3837. and why, therefore, would any one '
corruotly conspire to do an act which i
could" be of no benefit? There is not a !
particle of evidence before any special :
agent of the department of any combina
tion to create forest reserves, or to fix
their boundaries, and the suggestion is
an absurdity.
My business In Oregon was perfectly
legitimate. I would do it again it I had
the. chance; and I wish I had the chance,
for I would go in on a bigger scale.
"who attended to the business of se- .
curing title," "what did you get for the i
land." etc. If the answers were not sat- I
Isfactory. they were classed as "dum- j
znict."
I conceive -that a -man has the right to
sell what he own?,' and If he had no pre
vious contract, but was perfectly free to
sell to any one, he Is not a "dummy."
It seems that several of the "dummies"
were called before the special agents and
could remember only that they had sold
their lands. In this connection, I might j
mention that the word "dummy" has a <
variety of definitions. In the timber land j
entry cases at Eureka, recently noticed j
in the papers, the Government seemed to j
consider the man who admitted that he i
might sell his place after he had paid
therefor to be a "dummy," and Messrs.
Pugh and Burns have conceived the idea ;
that the same rule applies to State lands, j
for they have been Interviewing purchas- !

Answerâ I have studied the careers of I

have been on the coast for several^
months. Up to the time they went to
Portland, ten days since, I know that
they haa not discovered any fraud in my
land business, and I know equally weil
that they did not discover any while
there.
Third â The special agents are said to
have discovered that one J. H. Schneider'
secured title to vast 'tracts of land j
through dummies, who deeded their lands
to somebody, anu that somebody or his
grantee conveyed to Schneider.
Answerâ I find by my recoras that the
total amount of land in Oregon deeded to '
Schneider was a little over live thousand Â¦
acres; certainly not a vast domain, but. j
whether large or small, he had a right i
to purchase the land, either for himself
or others. !
siecondâ it is alleged that two special
agents from the -Interior Department
have been in Portland, Or., and nave un
earthed land frauds of great magnitude,
and that the head of the ring Is In San
t rancisco.
Jt is alleged as follows:
First â "ihat the Government has been
defrauded out of millions of acres of land
b> speculators who purcnased lands
within forest reserves at low prices and
eold them at large profits.
Answerâ If this be a rraud, then I must
plead guilty, for it is Just wnat I have
Uen doing' since the passage .of . the act
of Congress of June 4, ISHi, wnich pro
vided tnat the owners of patented lands
in forest reserves might surrender the
same to the Government and select an
equal area of land 'elsewhere -. In lieu
thereof, 'ihe papers trequently speak ot
this "lieu land fraud," but. while the
wisdom of the act might be questionable,
It is still the law, ana 1 for one will try
and get all the benefit I can therefrom
while it lasts. Â¦>
In this morning's papers, I find, "tele
graphic ieports trom Oregon connecting
my name with alleged land frauds in
Oregon which I cannot allow to pass

which attract attention for the day and

STOCKTON*, Oct. 22.'â Early " yesterday
morning a burglar entered the home of
Mrs. Daniel McCormlck and, despite her
screams, proceeded to ransack the house.
Mrs. McCormlck ran upstairs and locked
the doors and the burglar remained In full

for some time. .#
About 1 o'clock Mrs. McCormick heard
a noise downstairs. Thinking that a
screen had fallen, she lighted a lamp to
Investigate. As she entered the dining

HUNDRED yards distant rusty masses of ironstone preceded
f I an undulation in the flat country, and toward the base of one
I "tall block Lord Winstone descried an object which made him
. X rub his eyes with frank amazement, v'j > ! -.; *Â¦Â¦* - - <'
"Near the foot of the rock, his back against it, and shadowed/entirely-,
from the sun's light by a natural grotto in the stone. 'sat 'an ,e*iprmous T
man- or ape. Its stature ; was colossal, though smaller bv far than
the natives of Maoora had described; its naked body was bright srreen;
its -hands were folded over its breast; its misshaped head was bent for-
ward, and wild, snaky hair, also of vivid green, fell luxuriantly around it.
while pressed upon its crown was a wreath of flowers."
> "In the midst of this strange kingdom, silent, motionless and alone."
with uncouth face and distorted limbs, reigned this huKejrreen monster
in mortal shape. .
"Lord Winstone trot out his field glasses, without which, he . never
; hunted, and trained them on the grotto. He stared awhile, and then his
breath left his lungs in a gasp of surprise, as he returned the glasses to
their case and pushed forward.".. u â¢"Â«';;Â¦

SPEAKS TO-DAY
Continued on Page 7, Column 2.
The ramifications of business In all parts of
the world are so Intricate and far reaching
that what affects the money market in any
large way reaches us all. It is true that
there has been over-speculation, much of it
wild and foolish; some of It fraudulent and
dishonest. It does no good, however, to scold
and blame the speculator. He always follows
and participates In such a movement and al
ways will until human nature changes. The
purely gambling speculation on margins Is only
the fringe of the great trading and dealing In
stocks and securities tn Wall street, which is
a necessary part of modern business. Do not
misunderstand me as defending or even ex t
cusing this speculation. There is entirely too
much of It and too many business and profes
sional men, bankers and bank officers, have
been tempted and acquired the habit of specu
lation during the last few years of rapidly ad
vancing prices. - It should be stopped If there
is any way to do it, and you, as bankers,
can do as much to discourage. If not prevent.
It as auy one can. This sort of speculation,
however, Is not by any means a chief or lead
ing factor in the situation. The whole move
ment since the revival In business came has
been more or less speculative, and Just . as
business .has been unduly depressed and prices
tower than they should have been, we have gone
to the other extreme. Wall street and the spec
ulators are perhaps not so very much more to
blame than the rest of the country. Where Is
the man or the bank entirely free from sin to
cast the first stone? You may not speculate
on the Stock Exchange, or underwrite promo
tions but It Willie hard to find the bank
whose officers or chief customers are not In
some local promotion or combination which is
more or less speculative. Properly enough, too.
in many cases perhaps, for It is often one of
the best services a bank can render Its own
community to encourage local enterprises which
are legitimate and which are to be in honest
and competent bands. Tbe strongest claim
which Is made for our. system of locally owned.
Independent banks is that they develop local
institutions Â¦ end are able to lend .their credit
to worthy local enterprises and deserving men
where personal ' knowledge of the moral risk
Justifies Â¦ credit which would not otherwise be
granted. The interests of the whole . country
are so bound up together that no one section
can truthfully say we have plenty of money
and can take care of. ourselves no matter what
happens in ' Wall street. The manifestations,
of course, come in the financial centers' where
there are daily quotations of prices and rates
of Interest and weekly statements Of bank
conditions, but people in ail parts of the coun
try are doing business and' lending or borrow-
practical bearing on the present business situa
tion. We have another very different system
In force' and it Is with it we have to meet and
cope with our present problems. It has two
very great advantages. Our people are used
to It and have had no experience with any
other. Only the veterans in business remember
anything different- Its greatest advantage is,
however, its absolute safety and soundness.
Realize what this has meant in the last year or
two and efpeclally In the last few months. If
there had been the slightest doubt or uncer
tainty in regard to any of our currency, our
standard of value, or our national finances, th*
squalls we have thus far stood fo well would
have developed into a cyclone that would have
swept the whole country, leaving r^iin and dis
aster on every side. It is a very 'good system
which resists such strains, and there is great
force In the argument that this is not the tlnje
for any very radical change If we should now
attempt any at all. What is needed now 13
business sense and good Judgment, not legisla
tion. We may need currency legislation as we
have needed it for years, but It Is not to meet
this situation, and there Is no use to delude
ourselves with the hope that legislation will
help us out of trouble due to overex
pansicn and speculation. We need all tbe
reserve money we can g&t. but legislation will
not produce it. We must wait for the accumu
lation of gold, the only real reserve money. It
will be no real help to make a further large
increase in bank note circulation and no one
would think of adding to tbe volume of the
greenbacks. No legislation can change fixed
capital to productive capital. That Is merely
a question of time, and there Is nothing to do
but to wait for tt.
â¢ There is also a tendency toward recrimina
tion and placing the blame for the present busi
ness conditions on some one else; for one sec
tion of the country to blame another; for the
West to say It is all the fault of the Bast and
Wall street. Some very foolish people eay
they are glad to see the speculators lose be
cause they alone are to blame and the rest of
the people will not be hurt. There can Hiardly
be any more mistaken view than this. There
Is no man. woman or child in the civilized
world Â«o poor, so remote or obscure as not to
be more or less affected by the large move
ments In the financial centers. Very recently
I have known personally of enterprises In the
mountains of North Carolina. In California, in
Hawaii, in Alaska and in the Philippines whose
proposed pperations have been curtailed on ac
count of the uncertainty of the^money market.
The result Is that the amount of money to be
spent for wages and supplies among- people so
widely E?z>arated In different parts of the
world has been reduced and these people who.
if they have ever beard of such matters, regard
themselves as far beyond their reach and Influ
ence, have been directly affected in the amount
of their wages and Incomes and the prices of
their products. These are only examples of
thousands of similar cases and no one can say
he Is not concerned.
HONEY MARKET SENSITIVE.
economically and paying his debts. Not only
the j total amount of loans, but the portion" of
loans absorbed for fixed capital was at a min
imum. .The ; loaning capacity was, therefore,
available for \ employment , In any . way which
promised ; safety ; and - profit, and perhaps we
were ' for a whlie' more intent on the . profit
than the safety. , Now, however, we have had
a period of , extravagant living . and working,
and prices of ; all kinds are â¢ high. !'Â« It takes
more money or credit,, which is what Is used
in business, to do the same . volume . of busi
ness. What Â¦ Is more serious, a vast : amount
of this loaning capacity has gone into fixed
improvements, which: are either unproductive
or very. slowly, becoming productive. r
FARMS AFFECT LOANS.
There is one field In which the loaning power
has been absorbed which is not so fully appre
ciated because there I are no figures I to show its
amount and the facts are not so widely known,
and that ia in the purchase of farming . lands.
It; has been Â¦: very 'largely r a" movement from
some of the~ older Western States, f , where : the
prices . of \ farming lands Â¦- have become com
paratively ' high; :into the 'States ; farther Â¦ West
or into Canada,' where a man can buy two * or
"There exists to-day no one fact, and no
combination of facts, the logical sequence of
which suggests disaster. If disaster comes
it will be psychological and not logical. The
microbe. It tt exists. Is in the mind; It is
not elsewhere." ' . , Â¦ . ' Â¦ . '
It has been evident to any careful observer
for more than a year past that our bank loans j
have been expanding too fast;- The total loan-
Ing capacity of the banks of the country, as I
a .whole, Is limited by the amount of cash!
available as reserves for the deposits created
by the loans. The credits loaned by the banks
stay in the bank as deposits. The money may
be - transferred from bank to bank, but, as a
whole, the money stays in some bank and the
deposit" continues as a deposit. In the report
of the Comptroller of the Currency for 1002
there is a table given showing the amount- of
coin and all forms of currency In circulation
and the proportions held In the United States
Treasury,. In the banks, and now In either the |
treasury or the banks; in other words, in cir
culation among the -people. Except 'in unu
sual year* like 1893 and 1896 these propor
tions do not vary much. The treasury holds
12 per cent to 13 per cent; the banks 32 per
cent t;> 33 per cent, the people 83 per cent to
55 per cent of the cash, and these propor
tions have hardly varied at all, . while the
total money in circulation has Increased from
eighteen hundred million to twenty-seven hun
dred million dollars. The great bulk of thÂ«
loans remain as deposits In some bank, and
the chief limit to loans is the reserve for three
deposits, and the total loaning power of tho
banks, therefore, depends upon the amount of
deposits for which they can supply reserves.
In the- article I read before your convention
in New Orleans, a year ago, I gave the fig
ures showing the decline t In the percentage
reserves in | all the national banks at the fol
lowing dates:
December, 1896' 32.42 per cent
October, 1897 :: .31.70 per. cent '.
September. 1808 ; 30.27 per cent
September. 1809 ; 20.38 per cent
September,- 1000 ....29,67 per cent
September, 1901 .27.65 per cent
September, 1002 ......25.74 per cent
At the date of the last', call. September 0,
1003, the national banks showed 26.60 per cent. '
exactly similar figures' for" all the banks,
State and private â¢ and national, are not so ac
curately compiled, but about the same propor
tionate decrease in percentage of reserves has
taken place in all the banks of the country.
In this same period, while, the percentage, oi
reserves to deposits was continuously > on th*
decline, the amount of cash held by the banks
Increased from $074,000,000 in 1806 to
f 1,411,000,000 In 1902. In about â¢ the
same time the total loans of banks Increased
from about four billion to over seven and one
half billion dollars.. This available loaning
power was a very potent factor in tbe < great
business revival which we have seen in . the
last' few years. Its existence could ' not have
produced the revival without the aid of favor
able ' Industrial and commercial conditions, but
without this available expansion, of loans 'and
credits the revival would not have taken place.
There has, however, been another and perhaps
more important change in this loaning power
than -Increasing loans and the lessening, per
centage of reserves and Â¦ that . is . the way -In
which It Is now employed. The loaning- power
still exists; in fact, it Is in operation, as the
loans are now outstanding. In. 1897, when: the
expansion bejran, >we had' passed through- a'
period of most drastic and thorough liquida
tion. Every one has been living and 'working.!
no lion â¢ of disaster:

business has been going for the paÂ«t few years.

that the country has stood it. all so well, and
that there has been no panic, so little trouble

Beginning with the stock panic In May, 1901.
there have been repeated, and tremendous
slumps in. the prices of stocks and securities,
collapses and failures in railroad and indus

and a disastrous commercial depression. That
we have stood it all so well Is the best possib.e
ground for the belief that It need go no further

Able Address Is J>elivered on Busi
ness and the Currency.
The address of Comptroller Ridgely was
a long one, but the delegates listened to
it with marked attention and at its close
hearty cheers were given to the speaker.
The cheerinc was renewed again and
again, and Comptroller Ridgely was
forced to come to the front of the plat
form and bow his acknowledgments A
resolution of thanks to the able Comp
troller of the Currency was carried by a
rising vote. His address was as follows:
During the years of very active and pros
perous business which we have had since
the country began to recover from the depres
sion following the panlo of 1833. there- has
been a very marked Improvement in the funda
mental condition of our people and the amount
or both capital and wealth they have produced
and saved. This is especially true among the
f arming and producing classes, who have not
paid off a vast amount of debt, but have
accumulated money and property cf all kinds
to a greater extent than ever before. There
has been a great increase in the volume cf
money in circulation among the people and
there Is more money in the banks to their
credit. Since 18Â»C there has been a greater
increase In the amount of money in circula
tion than during any other like period and
about 80 per cent cf this increase has been In
told. We arÂ» continuing to add about *80 -
000.000 a year to our gold In circulation and
about one-half of all the currency In circu
lation Is gold. Our prosperity In business has
been baaed on the very best foundation. It
has been the result of the most legitimate
causes and forces, and all these are not only
etlll in operation, but give every evidence of
continuance. As la always the case, however,
in euch 'times, this movement of activity has
been accompanied by a large amount of spec
ulation, not only In stocks, bonds and secu
rities, but in many other lines and credits
have become more and more expanded- In
stock speculation and promotion especially we
have gone too fast, with the Inevitable result
of a serious collapse, and such a. decline ia
prices that people are becoming alarmed and
beginning to ask It this may not end thÂ«
whole movement of prosperity. This causes
doubt and Increasing hesitation in business
circles. There U also a demand for financial
and currency legislation, or Governmental aid
In meeting the situation as It exists at the
present time. While these Important ques
tions are all more or less connected and ln
t< rwovfn, the business situation Is not to any
very great extent due to currency or financial
causes, and tt is not to legislation we should
look for permanent relief. If we had a bet
ter, and especially a more elastic, currency
s-yMom. we might have been spared from some
disturbances. If ;he surplus revenues of the
Government had not been ta!:Â»n out of gen
eral circulation there might not be so much
fear of a tight money market. But. on the
other hand, if there had not been the most ab
solute confidence In the soundness of our cur
rency, the disturbances In the markets for se
curities in the past two years would proba
bly have spread very much farther, and doubt
less ended In a serious crisis with severe In
dustrial and commercial depression. If there
had not been a large surplus revenue and
plenty of money in the United States Treas
ury, the Secretary might not have been able
to render the assistance he has to the money
market on neveral occasions when he checked
trouble due to causes entirely apart from all
questions of currency or Governmental finance.
It Is true that there are some changes in our
Government financial system and paper cur
rency which are needed and which might be
made to very great advantage. If they were
in force. the?e changes might now be very
useful, but thts situation is not due to the
lack of them. We should make such a change
In the collection and disbursement of the na
tional revenues as will prevent the with
drawal of vast rums of money from business
juft when most needed. There is nothing so
raered about Government funds that they
should not be handled through the banks like
other people's funds so they m-ould produce the
least possible derangement of business. If any
of the great corporations should handle Its
funds Â«as the Treasury of the United States
does and lock up such a vast sum of cash In
Its own vaults, legislation would immediately
be demanded to stop it. We should at . once
;>ass men legislation as is needed to have the
Treasury stop it and let money and business
alone as much as possible. The lees the Gov
ernment has to do with business and business
with tbe Government, the better for both. .
CURRENCY REFORM NEEDED.
RIDGLEY SPEAKS.
The figures presented by Comptroller
Ridgely showed that the United States
has gone forward by leaps and bounds
since the general depression of ten years
apo and that the fictitious Inflation of
securities and their decline has not caused
any material effect upon the prosperous
fond-ltion of the community.
PROSPERITY and the; enormous
resources of thÂ« United States
were the themes discussed at tbe
session of the American Bankers'
Association yesterday at tbe Cali
fornia Theater.
There was a large attendance of dele
gates and visitors when President CaJd
well Hardy called the convention to or
der, as there was a general desire to hear
the address of Hon. William B. Ridgely,
Comptroller of thÂ© Currency of the. United
States, oa the topic, "Tbe Business Situa
tion and thÂ© Currency," and the paper
presented by J. E. McAshan. cashier of
the South Texas National Bank, Hous
ton. Tex., on "The Money Supply of the
United States."
Homer S. Kinsr, president of WellÂ»-
Fargo Bank cf San Franciaoo. waa to
have delivered an address, but he waa not
able to be present.
Considerable Interest was evinced In
the "call of States," which Is a feature
of the conventions of the Bankers' Asso
ciation. Each State selects a speaker,
who is limited v> five minutes, and state
ments are made of the conditions In the
section of the country from which he
comes. There -was but one keynote to
the statements yesterday. All told of
boundless prosperity and enormous in
crease In business and products.
The question as to whether the banks
of the association should do tbe bonding 1
of their employes in place of accepting
bonds from fidelity and guarantee com
panies was again brought beforo-the con
vention yesterday.
The matter has been under considera
tion for the last five years and on Wed
nesday last a special committee presented
a report favorine the association taking
steps to form a bonding branch. A vig
orous fight ensued on Wednesday over
the committee's report and It was de
feated In its recommendations to amend
the constitution, as it failed to secure a
two-thirds vote, as required, from the
membership.
A resolution "was Introduced yesterday
that the enecial committee on fidelity in
surance be continued for another year
and that the resolution be sent to the
executive council. The resolution carried
by a large majority.
A- resolution was also passed and re
ferred to the executive council that an
appropriation of $10,000 be allowed to the
educational committee in order that It
may continue Its work of educating bank
employes in a uniform system of work.
There Was some opposition as to tbe
amount of the appropriation suggested,
but the resolution finally prevailed.

three, or even five or ten, acres of the cheaper
lands for the selling price of one acre of his
old farm.* j This 'movement has not only taken
accumulated savings out of the older commu
nities, but large sums have been loaned to
make these purchases of lands. This Is a very
important factor to-day in many of the Mid
dle Western States. It Is not an unusual
thing to hear .from a local banker or from a
bank examiner that fifty to a hundred thou
sand dollars has thus been taken from a small
town, and the total amount of this must run
up Into many millions of dollars. Much of
the loaning power of the "Western banks has
been thus absorbed I which was formerly-, used
in the. purchase of brokers' - commercial paper
and loans on collateral In Chicago and New
York. (. Another â¢ large proportion of the. loan
ing cower ia absorbed In . carrying Increased
quantities of old' and new securities,, some of
them of more or. lens' doubtful value. This Is
the 1 situation which has called a halt and set
us all to thinking â not the.. lack of a compara
tively Â¦ few millions of currency to â¢ move the
crops ,or the accumulation of the surplus In
the treasury. Of course, those are factors of
great Importance, but they are not the leading
or controlling factors in this situation.
The power to loan still exists, the money is
still In the banks for reserves and there is as
much money as ever In circulation outside of
the .banks and the treasury. The question now
is. not so much the, power as the disposition
or willingness to loan. How far will the
country ko. in. the tendency .to contract the^e
loans? That tea question ' for the bankers
mainly to decide. For about a year thsre has
been a steady, almost uninterrupted decline In
the. prices of all stocks. ,and bonds, t It has.
however, . been f so | comparatively .gradual that
there have. been no bank failures and very few
stock exchange failures ; as the result and so
far general business has I not been _ seriously
checked. From a strictly banker's standpoint
his' situation has been in one respect . much
Improved. Â¦ However hard It has been on those
who have made the ' losses, the bank loans on
stock exchange collateral are now readjusted
upon the. much lower basts with at least as
much marjrln and probably more than on the
higher range of values. -. . A break In Â¦ prices
which If a banker knew it -was coming would
be- terrifying. Is 'now past and the banks have
not been hurt bv It. ' The explanation of this
Is that most qf the. people who have made: the
losses i had ' the ' money, to lose without losing
the money of the banks. ; Many of them made
it on the rise In Difws and only have, given
up part of the profits. â¢ There probably never
was a time before In the history of the country
when such a decline In stock prices could have
happened . and .found the people so Â¦ well pre
pared for it and the whole country with such
powers of resistance and I recuperation. We
are In an entirely different condition and this
Is what gives such foundation for hope and
firm faith In. the future. The way business
has' stood the decline. In stocks is an evidence
of strength, not weakness. There may be- and
doubtless will be some hesitation and curtail
ing of other line* of business aa the result, but
there is no-occaslon to be nervous or hysteri
cal about It. We should keep cool, and where
our calm judgment approves be bold and
courageous. - If we have been too hopeful, do
not let us all at once become too. pessimistic.
Let each bank stand ' by Us Â» customers and
stand by the country, as It deserves. It never
was In better condition when . facing any such

'compared with a few years aso, when more
' than a fourth the mileage and many of - the
Â¦ most . Important line* were^ in the receivers'
Â¦ hands You have no more of railroad receiver
ships. -The roads are on an entirely different
basis. The country has filled up so that they
have a vastly Increased volume of permanent
traffic; their tracks, machinery and organisa
tion are so Improved that they can handle their
business tar , better than ever before. There Is
no comparison which - can be .- made - of the
condition of the country to-day with what It
was only a few years ago which does not show
ithe surest foundation for enduring prosperity,

of which -this is not true. Â¦â¢ â¢-. . :Â¦â¢ â¢Â¦ : ..
BALANCE IS FAVORABUB.
'; -During. the last Â« ten . years the balance of
trade Â¦ In Â» favor .Â¦Â¦: of , the United States â¢ has
amounted to . over Â¦ three and three-quarter bil
lions i of dollars. For ; the single year : 1001
this .was $679,000,000. Although the alarmists
complain of a considerable 'Â¦ falling off for . the
year 1802. ' it : was v still almost half a billion
dollars, or about twice as much as It. had ever
been In any year of. our history previous to
1808. The aggregate wealth of tbo country
lias increased fully SO .per cent since 1S9O.
We are producing and adding to our stock of
gold every year about $80,000,000. and almoat
an equal quantity of silver. The annual value
of our farm products steadily Increases and
for the year 1003 it will be at least five billion
dollars. The deposits of all banks In the
United States have Increased since lv.tr> from
4900 millions to 9525 millions, almost double.
The deposits of all banks In the State of
Texas for this same period have increased
from $35,000,000 to over $80,000,000. about 228
per cent. In the State of Iowa- the Increase
has been from $78,000,000 to $211,000,000, over
270 per cent: in Kansas it has been from $35,
000,000 to $84,000,000, or over 250 per cent:
In Nebraska from $35,000,000 to $54,000,000,
or 228 per cent: in California from $200,0i^).000
to $iOCOOO,000. or 203 per cent. In Oklahoma
and Indian Territory, where, in 1S95, the total
deposits were considerably under $2,000,000,
there are over $27.0CO,000 on deposit In the
banks. The aggregate ' deposits In all the
banks In the States west of the Mississippi
River have increased from $701.000.1.00 In. 1S95
to $1,700,000,000 In 1!XW, or 242 per cent. The
three States of Minnesota. Iowa and Missouri
have more bank deposits now. than all the
States west of the Mississippi had In 1S9O,
and the States of Washington. Oregon and
California have $40,000,000 more bank deposits
than all the other States we3t of the Missis
sippi had In the year 1S90.
But it is almost unnecessary tÂ© quote figures
and statistics to you who are the custodians
of the funds and Viorouehly familiar with all
the business of your Home communities. No
one knows better than you bankers what a
great Increase there has .been in the wealth
and prosperity, of your own people at home;
how many of them are out of debt and have
money In your banks who ten years ago
seemed hopelessly buried under a burden of
debt they could never pay. Â¦ You of the South
know that . the change in Southern conditions
Is a revolution, and that with good crops of
corn and cotton your people are better off
to-day than they have ever been before. You
of the farming States, the West, the mountains
and the Pacific Slope, have seen whole States
which were apparently bankrupt, where farms
would not cell for the mortgage on them, raise
year after year record-breaking bumper crops,
and many of these mortgages paid off with
the proceeds of one or two years" harvest.
-You have seen farms produce in one year
crops of greater value than the land would
have sold for before the crop was planted.
You have seen your people P 3 *" on " their mort
gages and your bank deposits double and
treble wltMn the last few years.
You of the reserve cities, who are at the
centers of business and commercial life, have
seen equal prosperity among your merchants
and manufacturers. You know how your
country bank customers have prospered and
how their balances have Increased with you :
how many of them who used to have to borrow
of you are competing with, you and lending
money to your own city customers! -Every
State in the Union, every section of the coun
try has shared in all this. It Is no sudden
effervescence or bubble of speculation, but the
natural, inevitable result of potent existing
and continuing forces. It Is not going to dis
appear or vanish In a day because of a slump
In stocks or the collapse of a few underwriUng
syndicates. . It may be necessary to pause a
little to get our breath after the pace we
have rone, but If there Is any serious check
It will only be because we have lost our nerve
and ' courage. The course of business to-dav
very largely depends upon the bankers.- if
the banks Continue to act wisely and con
servatively, as they have, they can avert any
thing like serious trouble and keen the coun
try in shape for a - continuance of very pros
perous times. In doing this they can perform
a most patriotic service to the country, and,
as Is usually the case, the patriotic thing to
do is tbe wise and sensible business course
as. well. The banks have only to stand by
and . look out for the best interest* of tlTeir
customers and stockholders. If fach bank
takes care of Its own business and own people
and stands by them now there need be and
will be nothing more serious than a period of
waiting and perhaps^ some readjustment of
prices which might, in the end be & good thing
for every one. The speculations, promotions
and combination* which have run their wild
course were caused by and were not the cause
of prosperity. Prosperity came as the result
of the . productivity of our. fields and forests,
our mines and factories, the tremendous energy
and activity of our people applied to the mint
wonderfully productive country in the world.
It should not and will not eea,Â«e because the
speculative attempt to discount the future and
over-capitalize earning power has met with
fore-ordalned and Inevitable failure.

was by J. E. McAshan. cashier â¢ of the
South Texas National Bank, Houston.

Supply of the United States." The speak-
J. E. McAshan of Texas Deals With
Important Financial Question.
NATION'S MONEY SUPPLY.
THE latter part of yesterday's ses
sion of the bankers* convention
was taken up by the "call of
States." As the various divisions
of the Union were called the ap
pointed delegates arose and lauded the
prosperity of their sections of the coun
; try. some of them going into statistics
showing the resources of their home
States as to finance, agriculture and man
ufacture.
Almost every speaker waa thoroughly
convinced that his particular State was
the greatest in the Union. Some spoke
at length, and if any State was specially
noted for any one particular product,
whether it was men, finance, corn, wheat
or sugar, the convention was made aware
of the fact. In many instances indis
putable evidence In the way of lengthy
statistics was hurled at the listeners.
Most of the facts produced, however, had
to be accepted, out of courtesy if for no
other reason, the enthusiasm of the speak
er behur considered. ' "- .
It was evident from thÂ« remarks of the
first few speakers that those who came
afterward would not be able to do much
tooting of their trumpets without blur
ring some of the pictures painted by their
predecessors.
One old gentleman representing a West
ern State dwelt at length upon the In
telligent and beautiful women which his
home produced, all other chances to claim
prestige for It as a producer having been
completely eliminated by his predeces
sors.
Time and asraln some delegate waxed
so enthusiastic over his State that he
failed to hear the chairman's call of
"Time's up." As a consequence the meet
ing had to adjourn until 9:30 this morn
ing, so that the remaining States might
1 be heard from.
The call for the report of Alabama was
responded to by Pains B. Farley, cashier
of the M. and P. Farley Xatlonal Bank.
Montgomery, Ala. He said: "Alabama
is in a very prosperous condition. The
labor question is one that never perplexes,
wages being good. The crops have been
exceedingly good this year. Money is
plentiful and the banks are lendins tr>
our Eastern friend3. The banking capital
has Increased by three million -dollars.
Wildcat banking is now at an end in
Alabama."
To thft call for Alaska there was no
response.
Delegate Jacobs of Tuscon. Ariz., said:
"The people of Arizona are progressing.
There Is only one element of exchange
we would like to make. We woti!d like
to get oyt of our Territorial condition and
join the great galaxy of States."
Arkansas was represented by John G.
Fletcher, president of the German Na
tional Bank of Little Rock. He said: "I
bring you good tidings. We have more
fertile land than any other State In the
Union. There are 200 banks In the State.
Every village has one or more banks, all
in a reasonably prosperous condition. Ar
kansas Is the center of the United States
and one of the main pillars of the Union."
President J. M. EUiot of the First Na
tional Bank of Los Angeles delivered an
address of welcome on behalf of the peo
ple of California.
Colorado was not heard from.
Connecticut was represented by A. J.
Sloper, president of the New Britain Na
tional Bank. He said: "Connecticut is a
State of steady habits. We are in a very
prosperous condition. Our banks have a
capital of twenty-five million dollars, a
surplus of eighteen millions and a deposit
of sixty-five millions. Eighty per cent of
all the hardware manufactured in' the
country is made in our State. We make
nearly all of the tack supply of the United
States. 65 per cent of all the carpenters'
tools. 60 per cent of all the cutlery. 85- per
cent of the brass work and many oyier
metal appliances. Why. when you are
dead, the coffln you occupy will be bound
with brass and the lid screwed down
with screws from Connecticut, for we
produce 55 per cent of all the Union's
screw supply. Our savings banks have a
deposit of 525.0CO.00O for a population of
1.000,000 people."
The Delaware delegate was absent.
The District of Columbia was repre
sented by M. E. Ailes, vice president of
the Rlggs National Bank of Washington.
In part he said: "Of course, the District
is prosperous. Washington is the most
beautiful capital of the world and In the
greatest country in the world. We havs
no strikes and have the best paymaster
in the world. Uncle Sam. who. never de
faults on pay day."
Delegate Engle lauded the merits of
Florida. 'He said: "It would be bad taste
for me to dwell on the products of our
State, as the fruits are the same as those
raised here in California. I would gay,
however, that our orange groves are re
covering from the severe freezing of 1S93.
We produce one-half of the United States
supply of spirits of turpentine and resin.
The State is in a prosperous condition."
Colonel Robert J. Lowry, president of
the Lowry National Bank Atlanta. Ga..
responded to the call for Georgia. *HÂ»
said: "The crops of the staples, corn, cot
ton, tobacco and fruits. ! are very good
this year. Our cotton crop this year will
be over a quarter of a million bales.
There are 125 cotton mills in Georgia
manufacturing from the raw product. W^
raise tropical fruits and considerable Hve-J
stock, and are the foremost State In
manufacturing in the South."
"It has been a prosperous year, said
William George of Aurora. 111. "The
wage-earner is prosperous and Is putting
money in the banks. The farmers and
stock raisers are wealthy and the banks
are in good condition. Illinois boasts of
the largest Bankers' Association of Its
kind in the United States.'
According to Representative Smith from
Indianapolis, Indiana is ln*a prosperous
condition, as Is evinced by the fact that
she has 600 banks, all doing well and 417
of them are members of the Bankers'
Association. â¢â¢"
Indian Territory s call brought forth
none to laud her.
Frederick Heinz of Iowa spoke at length
on the many and varied resources of his
Edward Carroll, cashier of the Leaven
worth National Bank, dwelt upon the
glories of the Cyclone State. He said:
"Kansas produces from thirty-five to fifty

Why does this condition exist? The Demo
crat will tell you that it Is by an abuse of
the taxing power of the Government; that a
larger proportion of the people's money is
withdrawn from circulation than is needed for
the expenses of the Government. ' TTiey are all
Democrat a down our way, except Federal of
fice holders and other wards of the Â¦ nation.
The Republican will say that such is not the
case; that this preponderating preponderance
of veclth is due to a laudable effort - on the
paternal part of our paternal Government to
protect our little Infant Industries such as
the United States Steel Corporation. Mean
time, tbe banker !â¢ up against It. He who
would give the glad hand must show the
marble heart. His few days are full of mis
cry.
The banker is a hybrid in politics; be Is nel
thelr a Democrat nor a Republican. He la
composed mostly of legs and baldness. Liegs.
the more conveniently to straddle political
fence*, and baldness brought on by herculean
mental efforts to know on which side of the
fence to fall at tbe right time. It Is a tremen
dous Job for a banker to think; when he does,
â¢something Is sure to drop. Two of my friends
were running for office. They met In our bank
one day. One said the other was no Demo
crat. The other said the Â©ther was another.
The air became blue; the temperature began to
rise; the electric fans fairly churned hot air.
I saw that I bad to speak or lose both their ac
counts. Unlefs I did, each would think I had
said all the complimentary things which ea<5h
had said of the other. So at the first pause in
hostilities I said. "Gentlemen, don't, you think
that in the discussion of such gigantic ques
tions we are liable to run tbe economic center
of Immensities Into the political conflux of eter
nities?" They both said they did. and at the
same time with a paralytic smile bade me good
by and went away my Â¦ friends. I - had fallen
on the right side of the fence, but Just consider
the waste of gray matter involved in such an
effort! No, my fellow tyrants! We are not ex
pected to discuss the money supply of Uncle
Sam. That will be all right so long as he has
unlimited powers of taxation and requires
United States bonds as . security .. for United
States deposits.
The money, supply under discussion Is that
of the country at Urge; the money which is
available for business; the money .which is
available for paying deposits when our depos
itors withdraw a part of our working capital
to work on themselves. It is a mystery to me
what becomes of the money at certain seasona
of the jestr. There are time* every year when
; Coming as I do from the busy life of a
banker in whose never ceasing grind I have
epent a third of a century. It can scarcely be
expected that ray remarks will be as academic
as those of other men who have made the
study of theoretical finance a epeclalty. There
are. however, some things to be aald of the
money supply that will be recognized as truth
by a majority of bankers In this magnificent
commonwealth, whether they be from the city
or from the country.
Volney. in bis great work on thÂ« ruins of
empire*, classes tho banker with the tyrant,
and other oppressors of mankind. At a recent
banquet In New York given to bankers, one
of the orators, under the Influence of enthu
siasm, . patriotism, remorse and other stimu
lants, eald: "It is a good thing for us bank
ers occasionally to get together for the pur
pose of seeing what we can do. whom we can
do. and how we can do them." I see before
rae representatives of this honorable profes
sion of tyrants and doers, from all parts of
this great country. Â¦ I see before me those who
angle for trout and suckers in New York, and
thos<e who. with equal impartiality. Â«kln the
festive cat and larger fish on. the shores of
the Great X^akes. I eee my fellow doers from
the prohibition woods of Maine. Kansas and
Carrie Nation, to the boundless hospitality of
wide open San Francisco.
We. who represent the tyrannical profession
of bankers, are gathered here from the land
of icicles and bicycles, from the home of ar<>
matjc wooden nutmegs, from the land of the
magnolia and the home of the mocking-bird.
In fact, from everywhere I see before me mem
bers of that noble profession who do others
for fear that others will Co thero, and I am
confronted with the question. '"The Money
Supply of the United States."
. What are we going to do about it? What
can we do about it? Secretary Branch in his
letter to me suggesting this discussion in
vited me to limit my remarks to 2000 words.
so if I leavÂ« anything unsaid on this question.
Just lay it on my time limit. The request of
the secretary reminded me of one of my
friends. Tne friend had a little boy who ask
ed a great many questions. One day his father
said. "Dick, you take up too much of my
time asking questions." "Well," said Dick,
"Just answer rne one question and I will let
you off. It will only take you a minute."
"All right, if it will only take a minute, fire
away*" "Well." said Dick. "Just tell me
hon to work tnlracles and how to make con
densed milk." Dick's question remained un
answered. I am inclined to think that I
would show you a miracle if J should make a
thorough discussion of the, money supply of
the United States in 2000 words.
What do we mean by the money supply of
the United Et*.teÂ«? We do not mean the sup
ply of monf-y that has accumulated In tho
vaults of tbe Government. This needs no dls
cuaelon. We - all know that the Treasury of
the United States Is overflowing with money.
It baa even been suggested that the reason
the banks are so short on cash is because the
Treasury is to long on it as to have about
one-fourth of our circulating medium under
its control. It Is even hinted that Wall street,
with Its matchless ability and vulpine cun
ning â this last phrase is not original â disap
proves of the independent Treasury system. It
Is even spoken in whispers that our great cap
tains of finance rprnd days and even nights
in brain work trying to, evolve some' plan by
means of which they can do the Secretary, es
tablish a community of interest, as It were,
between Wall street and the Treasury and ex
change some Treasury fatness for Well street
leanness. The courting is all done by the
financiers.
er dealt with his theme in a skillful man
ner and Mr. McAshan was given a round
of applause at the close of his speech;
His a/Jdrres was as follows:

It seems to me that a perfectly satisfactory
emergency circulation could' be devised - alonK
the -following lines: Authorize the Secretary
of tbe Treasury to Issue treasury notes to the
national Â¦, banks to the extent of 25 per cent of
their paid-in capital on the following, terms
and conditions: The loan of these .notes to the
banks to be a general liability of the banks
secured by the several and proportional obli
gations of the stockholders of the banks to
whom the notes are loaned.. This pladge ot the
stockholders to be In the form of. a stbclc-
I would like to make a suggestion, not as a
cure-all, but -simply as -a suggestion subject
to fewer, objections . than any I have seen
brought forward. The relief should. be on the
emergency plan, pure.and simple, and. permissi
ble only In emergencies and . for . the public
pood. It should be In the interest of the peo
ple, and not classes, and should be taxed out
of circulation the moment the emergency , is
past. It should be safe and elastic. It should
be uniform. It should be of euch a charac
ter aa not to weaken public confidence In
banks. In ahcrt. It should be a currency based
upon sound economics and patriotism. :An un
secured bank circulation would be as safe as
are the deposits of the bank, for the resources
of the banks are guarantees of their payment,
and whoever. would deposit money In a bank
wou d accept the bank's note. This, of course
would only operate locally. . â¢
We then write our central correspondents to
find if they have any money; that while we do
not expect to use our credit. Oh! no! as a mas
ter of form we write to them, and they write
back that they have none, but In case our
scruples are removed against using our credit,
that we are ouch valued customers that they
will Impair their reserves for our sake. Now
the question Is. how can we avoid charging
prohibitive rates of interest, when our deposits
are melting like the beautiful snow? How can
we avoid that nwntal strain that is required
to make a banker look cheerful when the
whole beautiful realm of nature seems hung
with crape and in mourning; when the waves
of the sea wm to chant dirges; when the
winds In the woods seem to whisper requiems;
when the thunders on the mountains seem to
growl funeral marches, the prairie breeies howl
lamentations, and even in sea, and wood, and
prairies, and mountains, make our vacations
a travesty and a farce.
How can we relieve our central reserve cor
resijondents from the embarrassment of Im
pairing their reecrvea out of mere politeness to
us? How can we do these things and not vio
late the fundamental principles of American
liberty and sound economic*? I believe that
the creation of money is an, attribute of sover
eignty, and should not be delegated to private
persons. I believe. that assets currency Is an
Injustice to depositors. Nothing should ever
be done to Impair the security of the depositor.
I believe that the right to issue unsecured cur
rency by individuals is monopolistic and un-
Amcrlcan. It would be the bestowal of unjust
and unequal privileges and would be wrong.
These are the fundamental doctrines of my
financial creed. I am. however, not a dreamtr,
an idealist or an enthusiast. Kmergency con
ditions require emergency remedies. I recog
nize conditions as they exist and would like to
see a remedy devised, for it would result to
the Interest of agriculture, manufacturing, com-,
nerce mining and transportation, which con
stitute the entire circle of human enterprise.
There are times of the year when the volume
of money la not sufficient, and no one knows
this btttec than the farmer, tbe country mer
chant and the country banker.
When the earth has yielded her increase,!
when the harvest moon hangs -high in the
heavens, when the sound of the thresher is
heard in the rice ilelds, when the darkeys etng
amid the sugar cane, when the great North
west pours Its grain In golden floods all over
the land, when old King Cotton holds his Im
perial court In the snowy fields of the fleecy
staple; when the withered banners of the corn
are still, and gathered fields are growing
strangely wan; while death, poetic death, with
hands that color whatever they touch, weaves
in the autumn wood his tapestries of gold and
brown; when everywhere In this mighty nation
from the icefields of Alaska to the shimmer
ing glory of the Mexican gulf, ' from the un
friendly woods of the distant Maine, where
the God of Day sheds his beams of gold at
dawn to the radiance of the Queen of Night,
who at the self fame hour sheds her silver
light over tbe Philippine Archipelago, then it
Is that the banker realizes that our currency
needs rt-llef in order that the American banker,
the American farmer, the American merchant,
end the American manufacturer may handle
to the bÂ« st advantage the fruits which have
been bo bountifully provided under the provi
dence c! God. How can this be done and not
violate sound economics?
tbe whole country has an abundance, or seems
to have. Interest rates teem searching for
zero: loans are paid off and from New York
to San Francisco and from Maine to Texas all
the banks seem loaded with awag. There are
other beasons when tber* is' a. great scarcity
of It. TVbere doea it go? New York does not
have it; Chicago does not have it. Â¦ 1 think
from all appearances here it emigrates to Ban
Francisco. The country does not have It. It
exists," but is so nimble that we cannot find it.
The fact that the whole country, under normal
conditions, has at certain- seasons of the year
an abundance of money. In spite of all financial
piracy and buccaneering, is proof Â¦ that under
ordinary conditions Â» the money supply of the
United States la sufficient for our commerce.
The comparative volume of money in circula
tion compared to the volume of trade Is greater
in the United States than- in any other country
of the world. I make this as an assertion. I
am not going Into statistics. Figures never lie,
but statistics are sometimes misleading. A rail
road company sometimes borrows money for
yeara to pay its dividenda, still expert account
ants can figure out that the stock la a gilt
edged security.' . Â¦ Â¦
Under normal conditions our money supply
Is ample: even now circulation is being retired
more rapidly than the law permlta. In Febru
ary and March, with large deposits, we some
times carry a reserve of 80 per cent and blazon
to the world our great riches. The solvency
of a bank Is gauged by the magnitude of its
debts; the Insolvency of other corporations is
gauged by the came standard. We see thla re
eerve melt In the balmy days of May to CO per
cent, and in the beautiful poetic June to 00 per
cent, in businesslike July to 40 per ocnt and
in the deg days of August to a poor, pitiful 25
per cent, down to the disgraceful level of New
York, and we wonder how the mighty have
fallen so low.
I^>t u r hope that the glory and fame of the
T'nltrd States may not be tarnished by unwlst
financial policies. May this nation whose vic
torious arms on land and sea have astonished
tins- world. "whose triumphs In mechanical arts
and" sciences have won the applause of nations.
who*e far-reaching commerce has invaded and
subdued by gentle. yet compelling force Europe,
the 'Orient and the Isles of the sea, making It
the" arbiter of the world's' destiny, while not
aiming at the world's empire: may this nation
which. In civil liberty and education, uplifts
and upbuilds the human race, and shall be the
luminary, for all the ages yet to be poured Into
the la? of empires from the secret caverns of
time; may this nation, which seems to have
been reserved by- the god of nations for the
manifest destiny of dominating and. redeeming
the globe, which has evinced a spirit of patriot
ism and whose battle hymns have rekindled the
altar fires. of the earth; let this nation formu
late a financial theory at least not narrow, per
verted or RelHsh: not tainted with the odium
of caste or lnx with the taint of unsoundness
but such a i theory as may be In keeping with
the sublimity of our history and 'the magnifi

treasury notes should not bÂ« made indiscrim

and has been ascertained by the treasury

Thus, when a bank showed among its liabili

would promote confidence, and be a badge of

THE bay excursion tendered to the
visiting bankers by the bankers
of San^ Francisco was one of the
important events In the enter-
â¢ tainment of the city's visitor*.
The ferryboat Berkeley, which was
tendered by the Southern Pacific
Company for the excursion, was gaily be
decked with flags, which were strung in
profusion from stem to stern.
Shortly after 2:30 p. m. she pulled away
from the dock at the foot of Market
street and headed for Hunters Point,
where the only stop was made In order
that .those of the party who wanted to
take photographs might land and obtain
desirable views of the steamer. From
there the cruise was to the Alameda
mole. Oakland pier. Oakland transit pier,
naval training school, Terba Buena Isl
and, the Brothers lighthouse, . Raccoon
Straits, Angel Island. Tiburon. Belvedere,
Sausallto, Golden Gate, Fort Baker, Fort
Slason,, Presidio. Telegraph Hill. Alcatraz
Island and water front to starting point,
where the boat arrived at 6 o'clock. There
were on board about 1500 v.3itors, all of
whom were loud in praise of the gran
deur of the bay and Its environments and
equally loud In the manifestations of the
royal hospitality that had been extended
to them on all sides. The ladies of tne
party were especially enthusiastic in
praise of the kindnesses and the cordial
ity that had been showered on them.
Foremost among those who were loud
in their expressions of praise of San
Francisco and its hospitalities were
Charles O. Austin, vice president of the
National Bank- of North America of Chi
cago; Frederick Kasten, the second vice
president of the Wisconsin National Bank
of Milwaukee; William F. Kettenbaeh,
president of the Lewinton National Bank:
Claude Meeker of Meeker Bros." Bank of
Columbus. Ohio, and John T. Harrington
of Youngstown, Ohio.
They all stated that the convention
could not have pqsslbly been attended
under, more pleasant auspices and that
they were more than surprised at the
size and beauty of. the city.
The day was comparatively dear and
the visitors were enabled to see the prin
cipal points of interest in the harbor to
excellent advantage.
In the main cabin a splendid stringed
orchestra played. On tbe lower deck a
fine luncheon was served at the pleasure
of the guests.
The excursion was actually under the
supervision of H. R. Judah. assisted by
William McMurray. who has charge of
all the details of the side trips of this
convention.

Thus whatever effect Mayor Olney's call to the
women v raay- have had in Oakland/ its result' on the
other side of the continent has been that of reviv
ing the suffrage question. Doubtless it-will be of ad
vantage to the Bostonians to -<atch the Oakland ex
periment and learn what can- be achieved by women
of. brains, energy. and beauty without the use of the
ballot. In: fact, Boston will learn. much by studying
Oakland and her people at all times, and now that the
study has begun it should. continue; steadily.
MAYOR. OLNEY'S appeal to the women's
clubs of Oakland to assist him in building up
public institutions and in making his admin
istration more successful than ' it could be without
such co-operation has been heard clear across the
continent. From far-off Boston comes a- response
through the medium of theT Woman's Jouni.al of that
city. It commends the appeal of the Mayor and
heartily indorses the adoption of a policy of co
operation ofwomen.'s clubs with municipal govern
ments for good purposes all over the Union.
The Boston authority^ however, docs not believe
there, can be an effective and full use of woman's
energy in the advancement of municipal life without
conferring upon women the. right to vote. It says:
"When the women's clubs of any State try to im
prove the civic conditions of towns and cities in
which they have their homes, as they are beginning
to do, they will soon become alive .to their- need of
the suffrage as the thing required and indispensable in
order to make our efforts effective. And when these
organizations have thus been convinced they will
soon unite with the suffragists. in a demand for the
municipal ballot, and the joint demand will be heeded
by the Legislature. This was strikingly evidenced
here in Massachusetts two years ago by the success
of our bill making mothers equal guardians with
fathers of their minor children." It was introduced by
the Suffrage Association and supported, by the
women's clubs. The combination proved irre;
sistible." . " ...\ ',-.;.. -' . "

the serious charge of having accepted bribes from

bribery to accept money from them.

The Republican ticket is an excellent one in every
respect. It was nominated by a convention whose
delegates were thoroughly representative of the city.
In the Republican primaries at which the delegates
were elected more votes were cast than in the Demo
cratic and the Labor Union primaries combined. It
stands for all classes of the people, or, as it would be
more correct to say, it stands for the people without
recognizing any class divisions among them. The
head of the ticket is one of the foremost business
men of the State and his integrity and capacity are
indisputable.. The candidates for other offices are
each and all well fitted for the performance of the
duties of the positions to which they aspire. There
is every reason, therefore, why the support given
them should include every independent voter and
every conservative Democrat; every citizen, in short,
who knows the evils of class politics and social dis
sensions, and who seeks to have a community whose
motto will be, "One for all. and all for one."
The vast powers of the Mayor have been repeat
edly enumerated- and are now well understood by in
telligent voters. An unscrupulous Mayor holding
ihrough two successive terms would have virtual
control of every administrative board and commis
sion of the city. He would dominate the great de
partments of administration, and through the Police
Commission woultl have almost arbitrary power
over all saloon-keepers and others who require li
cense? to carry on business. We have seen how
great Abe Ruef has become by two years of exer
cise of . a partial control of the various boards and
commissions, and the results arc sufficient to con
vince any one that it will be a bad day for San
Francisco should he have full control over them all.
The conservative Democratic party has no more
place in the politics of to-day in San Francisco than
the old Whig party had in the slavery and anti
slavery fight of i860. This community is face to
face with a movement to establish a class party,
founded upon discontent, representing no avowable
political principle nor any definite policy, either
cicic, State or national; having no means of main
taining itself other than that of stirring up strife
between labor and capital or making use of municipal
offices as spoils to be distributed among the fac
tional leaders according to their subservience to
Schmitz and Ruef. To defeat that scheme and to
clear the Â«ay for straight politics on normal lines in
future is the prime duty of every good citizen at this
time. The appeal for a response to such duty runs
to workingmen, professional men, business men and
capitalists alike, and the right response should be
forthcoming from every intelligent and thoughtful
man.
friendship, to vote for a candidate foredoomed to
defeat when by doing so they will imperil the
chances of electing a conservative Mayor and greatly
increase the menace of the possibility of two more
\ ears of Schmitz and Ruef.

WHEN* the friends of Mr. Lane take a fair

no reason for voting for him beyond that

him on any other ground, nor indeed does any work

election. He is distinctly out of place in the field
and has hardly a possibility of success.

Mrs. Kate O'Donnell. 476 Eighth street,
a widow and the mother of three email
children, became suddenly Insane yester
day afternoon. The woman's .condition
was noticed by several of the neighbors,
who sent word to the Southern Police sta
tion. Patrolmen Hennessy and Morlarlty
went to the home of the unfortunate
woman and removed her to the detention
ward of the Emergency Hospital. '
The ca*e of Mrs. O.Donnell is a pitiful
one. About a year ago her husband died,
leaving, her with three children, all under
12 years of age. Since that time Mrs.
O'Donnell has had a hard time to sup
port herself and her little ones. The fam
ily has been in destitute circumstances of
late and the unfortunate woman found it
impossible to administer to the wants of
her children. '
Mrs. P'Donnell brooded over her troubles
for a long time and of late her mind has
been wandering. She never showed any
signs of violent insanity, however, tin
yesterday afternoon. The three children
have been placed in charge of the matron
at the Emergency Hospital till a home
can be found for them. Â»
Sad Plight of Mrs. Kate O'Donnell,
the Mother of Three Small
Children.
DIVINING JRODâ W. W., Watsonvllle,
Cal. No good reason has yet been given
why a divining rod, usually a forked
willow or hazel branch, used to locate
water or minerals, will turn in the hands
of some people and not In the hands of
others. Not long since nine gentlemen
went to Santa Clara County searching
for water on a tract of land by- means
of the. divining rod. In the hands of
eight different . men, at various spots on
the tract, the rod turned and was vio
lently agitated, while in fhe hands of the
ninth, the same rod on the same spots
was always inactive.
IN the land of steady habits and wooden nutmegs
lived Mr. Bennett, an admirer of William'. J.
Bryan. Mr. Bennett by keen industry had made
a fortune, and advised Mr. Bryan by letter that he
proposed to lea.ve of the same the sum of $50,600 to
him. Bennett is now gathered to his hard-fisted
fathers and Mr. Bryan is in court in New Haven
claiming the legacy. Its payment is resisted by the
widow, and during the hearing of the case Mr. Bryan,
who seems to appear in court as his own attorney,
has, in substantiation of his claim, read a large num
ber of letters from the testator, from which it ap
pears that during his lifetime he was a liberal do
nator to Mr. Bryan's funds. One donation of $3500
is mentioned.
Mr. Bennett seems to have been impressed with,
the divine ratio of 16 to 1 and with Mr. Bryan as its
expounder, hence this effort .to get $50,000 as evi
dence of that impression. Mr. Bryan stated in court
that he. would not make personal use of the money,
unless the widow consents thereto, but proposes, if
the court gave it. to him in spite of the widow's re
sistance, to devote it to charitable and educational
purposes. Nothing is easier than to be philan
thropic with the money of another. But people who
have "wholesome ideas of propriety will conclude
that if Mr. Bennett's money is to be invested in
philanthropy his widow, the wife who wrought by
his side in the acquisition of that wealth, is its proper
almoner, and not a stranger.
It is revealed in the hearing of the case that Mr.
Bryan consulted with - Bennett about 'â¢ this bequest
and suggested means of foffifying it -and making it
sure. Had he Tendered service to the testator de
serving such a recognition his present eager pur
suit of the money would have a better appearance.
But there was no such personal service, so that the
affair has a sordid appearance not creditable to Mr.
Bryan. The revelation of Mr. Bennett as a cheerful
giver to Bryan during his lifetime suggests^ that the
peerless orator may have hypothecated his figures of
speech to many others during his scintillant and me
teoric career. .

serpents to bÂ« able to fascinate the small
animals on which they prey hai been
often ridiculed, but It is supported by *
great deal of evidence and has been fully
accepted by a . number of scientific ob
servers. Numerous Instances of fascina
tion are given in the works of Kalra. LÂ«
Valliant, Dr. Andrew Smith and Ell'.s.
noted scientific writer*. Snakes do not
fascinate human beings.
Stricken by conscience, a Wyoming man who par
ticipated as among those present at a recent lynching
has confessed to the authorities 'and has implicated
thirty-five otherwise reputable people" of the State
in the crime. His self-satisfaction, conscience in
spired, is" somewhat clouded by the uncomfortable
fact that every one of the other thirty-five fellows is
possessed by an animated desire to murder him.
8NAKE BLINDNESSâ Z., Petaluma.
Cal. Snakes become partially blind sev
eral times a year, at the time they shed
the skin. The skin is always thrown off
by reversing it, so that the ' transparent
covering of the eyes and" that of thÂ»
scale* are always found concave in the
exuviae, Previously the whole cuticle be
comes somewhat opaaue. the) eyes arÂ»
dim and thÂ« animal is evidently blind;
also becoming more or lesÂ» Inactive.
GAME IN ALASKAâ Hunter. City. The

or on the Alaska Peninsula, we3t of
Lake Ilaimna (except for scientific pur

General Alger and his party will pro
ceed north to-morrow, going direct to
Portland.
Mr. Bliss is much impressed with what
he saw of California Journeying from the
.south, and said that the residents of the-
State have good reason to be proud of the
vast territory of rich lands that they con
trol. Of the country in general he said: .
"Prosperity shows Itself everywhere
you go. We have more money than we
really need and this great surplus is a
splendid guaranty against the develop
ment of a panic." Wall street flurries
mean nothing to the country as a whole.
Through the efforts of speculators artifi
cial values have been given to some of
our market securities, but these have
finally been forced , to a normal basis of
legitimate business and hereafter we will
have less cause to worry about infla
tions."
.'General Alger's prime purpose in com
ing West at this, time was to inspect his
mining: properties in Arizona, t This- he
has already done and he is now bound for
the Northwest to look over his' timber
holdings in .that section. '[; It was his orig
inal j intention, to - spend \ several . weeks on
the coast and most of it in this State, but
the"' recent call for a ; special session of
Congress has caused him. to shorten his
visit. He was not inclined yesterday to
enter Into a diBcuselon of politics, .but he
remarked that everything in the East
suggested that that section of the United
States is solid for Roosevelt, and he said
that he confidently expected' that a re
nomination would be- secured without op
position. Referring to the . canal propoal-.
tion, the General said:
"I am in favor of a canal and will be at
all times. As to a route, I personally
have no choice except one that will prove
the most feasible. If I had my way'tho
Government would set about, building a
canal at once. Th8 cost j of construction
should be a matter of second considera
tion." â¢

'npHERE was recently published an interview
I with Federal engineers- concerning the use of
* the waters of Clear Lake in an irrigation
scheme in charge of the United States in the Sacra
mento Valley. The Colusa Sun says that the en
gineers have disavowed this interview, and adds that
as the Federal law, contemplates the distribution of
water to tracts of only 160 acres, its application to
the lands of the Sacramento Valley is impossible.
As the editor of the Sun> 'General Green, is the pio
neer irrigation engineer of California, and has knowl
edge of water laws unusual for a layman, his opinion
is entitled to credits The valley lands of this State
have long been in private ownership. It has .been the
popular understanding of the Federal irrigation law
that it applies .to lands in public ownership, which
are to be withdrawn from entry, until the water i$
impounded and ready for distribution, when the
lands are to be opened for entry in tracts not to ex
ceed 160 acres, to be sold at a price which returns the
cost 'of irrigation to the Federal treasury as a re
volving^ fund to be again "applied to the building of
irrigation works elsewhere where the conditions are
the same.
Now, if it be true that the limited holding of 160
acres is applicable to the use of water impounded
and distributed under the Federal law, # and. that the
present owners of our Â»valley land can â¢ get water for
only that amount of land, no matter how much more
they may own, the policy of depending at all bn the
Federal Government is open, to doubt and debate.
On one hand it may be urged that the effect would
be to break up larger Holdings than .the limited
amount. ' This is desirable. We, like many other
States, inherited the system of land-holding in large
tract?. It"impedes the settlement and population of
the State. Our climatic conditions are such that in
dustrious and intelligent tillers of the soil make more
on less land than elsewhere in the Union. We have
the best field for intensive farming, for the ceaseless
production of high-priced crops of all kinds, and,
over most of our tillable area, for the making of sev
eral crops instead of only one a year. So we pre
sent advantages to the small land-holder that he does
not elsewhere enjoy.,.
But our people have the pride of possession. They
like to own much land, and some stubbornly maintain
their large holdings though their profits from -them
may be small or even though they keep them at a loss.
Those who have this spirit strongly developed are
usually the older settlers of the State, who remem
ber the past profits of stock ranging or wheat grow
ing .on their large pastures or plantations and look
upon intensive farming pf smaller tracts as a modern
innovation which they are not inclined to favor. So
it is probable that they would be disinclined to ac
cepr Federal irrigation if within their reach, and the
law does not compel them to accept the use of the
water. But the availability ot such water would'
make their lands too valuable to lie idle, and business
sense would compel' them finally to cut up their es
tates and sell small tracts to holders who desire to
put the land to its best use by irrigation.
There is a demand for irrigated land in the West
that' promises to increase rather than diminish. In
the valley of the Snake River, in Idaho, from. Idaho
Falls far up beyond St. Anthony, irrigated land sells
readily for $40 to $60 per acre, and the trains from
the East are filled with buyers at that price. Yet
that land was primitively a sagebrush desert, not
even producing wild grass, until it was made fertile
by irrigation. The desert entrymen combined and by
co-operation built- canals, taking the water of the
Snake River, and though the first settlements were
made only fifteen years ago the region now is a pic
ture of rural abundance and resembles the old farm
ing regions of the Middle West. But the altitude
is high, the season is short and the land yields but
one crop a year, except in alfalfa, which may be cut
twice. It seems reasonable that if such land on
those high plateaus commands that price, all irri
gated land in California, with our long season, the
absence of winter and the capacity to produce a great
variety of crops, is actually worth twice or thrice
as much, \ if it be equipped with equal facilities for
irrigation.
As to that equipment, its possibilities are every
where present, but are not always used. General
Green is of the opinion that the district system,
which is co-operative, will again come in vogue, be
cause the land will bear Jthe expense of any irriga
tion works which its owners choose to adopt. But
the problem is, how to get them to act. The Butte
Canal Company has just been compelled to aban
don, its project to take water from Feather River
in a canal to cost $200,000. carrying it down the west
side of that stream, and furnishing* it at $1 50 per
acre for the first ten years and Si per acre thereafter
in perpetuity. That is cheaper than in any of the
plans so far proposed by the Federal Government,
and yet the projectors could get contracts covering
only 4000 acres of land. Twelve year? ago, when the
same system was proposed by other parties, the
contracts covered 12,000 acres.
There should be some means, of ascertaining why
the popularity of irrigation in that fine region has de
clined by two-thirds when measured by. the acreage
willing to accept it. If it be found that in the mean
time individual irrigation by wells and pumping has
taken the place of canal supply by gravity, that will
account for it.- If not, the -present situation implies
retrogression. We are of the opinion that if the
land-holders of California could witness the rush of
buyers to the irrigated deserts of Idaho and Montana
we would see such a revival of irrigation, enterprise
in this State as would not leave out a single acre
that could receive water.

say that a -'trade school' upon such; lines and devoted

of a different character."- Â¦ \'%
We did not so classify the San Luis Obispo schools
nor in any way suggest 'a' semi-penal character, which
if surely has not. Time was that two polytechnic
schools â one in Troy, N. Y., and one in Boston â
supplied the entire demand of the country for train
ing in higher mechanics. But that was in the days
of the open shop and unlimited privilege of appren-,
ticeship. ; In that period of our history the semi
penal State reform school was also practically un
known. But' the open "shop has disappeared: The
enormous immigration -to- this country: has closed
the shops to our native-born youth, and the privilege
of apprenticeship is denied and abridged, so that it
is worthless.. The result is idleness of our youthj
wi^h its rices finally crystallizing into crime, making
necessary the semi-penal institutions "'Â¦ for the re
straint of incorrigible youth. .
6ut of this condition, caused. by the closed shop,
comes the opportunity that â¢ the *>pen shop formerly
furnished, but which now is had in the excellent'

Performance at Tivoli Seems lake
Dress Rehearsal, Stage Manage
ment Being Lacking.
A performance amazingly amateurish as
a. who'.e for the Tivoli was the "Andre
Chenicr" of last 'evening'. The first two
' acts of the opera were literally nothing
more than a dress rehearsal, with an oc
casional gieam of the ensemble spirit.
Principals, chorus and orchestra shared
alike In the general slackness, with the
; exceptions of Greeoretti, Ischierdo and
Cortesl. who were sufficient and sympa
thetic. The stage management was want-
Ing and the whole thine lacked in tone and
ppirit. It was not until the third act that
things pulled themselves together, and
then came an achievement that was as
pood as the preceding acts were bad.
True, it would be a wooden company in
deed that would not rise to the inspira
tion of . the scene, but it waa eiven all
around with a brilliancy that recalled the
wonderful performance of last year.
Gregoretti's Glrard was eminently ca
pable. He fulfilled handsomely the ex
acting dramatic requirements of the role
find pang nobly. Ischierdo, though his
Chester lacks the vocal sweetness and
eomething of the poetry o f Agostinl's in
terpretation, has perhaps a more vivid
dramatic thrill. Like all his work, it
was notably intelligent. Benedetto, who
suggests with difficulty the young and
beautiful inamorata of Chenier. redeemed
the uncertainty of her earlier work of
the evenir.e: with a splendid third act.
She has done nothing better this season.
Her voice, at its best of notable beauty,
came out sslendidly. and she lifted to
the tragedy of the scene. Marchesini's
blind mother w?.g an excellent bit and
deservedly gained much favor. Miss Bar
ker was the Eersi. and, though unsure of
her part, yet showed' a pleasing vocal
equipment, temperament and cultivation.
Dado, always useful, filled In In small
parts, with Cortesi competent in the
others.
The opera itself gains largely on ac
quaintance, and when it gets to going
at Tivoli le\-els. and at tne height of last
night's third act, will rival even "La Bo
heme" In popularity.

alone interestinc but at times was thor
oughly humorous. He was heartily ap
plauded at the close of his remarks.
The Rev. E. E. Baker, D. D., also ad
dressed the assemblage on "Home Mis
sions."
The session will be resumed at 9 o'clock
this morning and will be continued
throughout the day and evening.
HEAR ENCOURAGING WORDS.
; The afternoon session of the synod was
i devoted also to hearing reports and some
: stirring addresses. It was decided that
; the home mission committee shall meet
j twice a year and that the railroad ex
penses of one of these meetings shall be
, paid by the church.
The Rev. W. G. White read a report of
the committee on foreign missions, in
which lt was stated that the work had
proved to be a triumphant success. The
call from the whole world, said the re
port, had never come with such force as
now. In response to the call for 214 men
something less than 100 had offered them
selves for missionary work. Addresses
were delivered by the Rev. Thomas Mar
shall, D. D., field secretary representing
the board of foreign missions; the Rev.
Richard Willey. D. D.. and the Rev.
James M. Newell, D. D.
The evening session was devoted to ad
dresses on "Home Missions," the Rev.
James Mitchell presidine.
The report shows that the board of
California had but fourteen missionaries
in the field In 1S97. while to-day it is rep
resented by twenty-one" missionaries and
possesses a constituency in the State of
Calif ornia* of more than 10,000; that during
the year the board had received and dis
bursed 920.636 47. The sum of $11,520, lt
was announced, had been apportioned to
the Occidental board by the general as-
Eembly for the purpose of conducting and
increasing mission work in foreign lands.
Besides supporting missionaries and
schools in foreign fields the board is spon
sor for three schools in. San Francisco,
where boys and girls are educated.
Mrs. Gow Wing, the house to house
visitor and the first convert to Christian
ity under the guidance of the board, is
reported to be doing heroic work, having
visited 230 Chinese houses, 395 rooms, 500
women and 798 Chinese children, with
the result that the congregation Is
growing and the number of scholars in
creasing.
Mrs. Cyrus S. Wright announced the
contemplated purchase of a twenty-five
foot lot at the east side' of the mission
home, 920 Sacramento street, and earnest
ly appealed to the friends of the work to
aid in the purchase by procuring blocks
of stock.
The assemblage heard tho annual re
port of Mrs. L. A. Kelley, the general
secretary of the Occidental board, which
gave the information that there were
three new missionaries this yearâ the
Rev. Clarence D. Harriott, who has gone
to Hanchow; Miss Ednah Bruner, who
has departed for Bankok, and Dr. and
Mrs. H. C. Whiting, who will sail this
morning for Korea on the Siberia.-

STOCKTON, Oct. 22.â The High Court
of the Independent Order of Foresters
voted this morning to recognize compan
ion courts in the order. The action was
taken just prior to adjournment and was
about the most important thing considered
during the* whole session.
The admission of women into the order
had been talked of and the delegates
came to Stockton fully prepared for the
issue. Past High Chief Ranger -O. S.
Cooper of Valiejo, who presided at the
session, was one of the foremost in ad
vocating the recognition of companion
courts. He appointed the following com
mittee at the beginning of the session to
consider thÂ© matter: F. F. Skelly, John
FairweÂ»ther,.J.. P. Murphy, M. F..Qulnn
and G. ,W. Hoyle. The committee brought
in a favorable report this morning and it
was adopted with but slight opposition.
The installation of the new grand offi
cers who were eWcted yesterday also took
place this morning. Deputy Supreme
Chief Ranger William R. Uber of Los
Angeles installed the California officers.
The session of the High Court finally ad
journed at 12 o'clock.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 22.â The most sen
sational episode . ever witnessed In the
Los Angeles Police Court was the en
forced appearance there to-day of beau
tiful Mrs. Max Basch, who faced Judge
Chambers as she lay on a airetcher. One,
night last week Mrs. Basch told a har
rowing tale about having been gagged,
beaten, robbed and chloroformed by a
tramp. Her tale was discredited, but she
swore to a complaint accusing John .8.
Hennessey, a former fireman, of the
crime. Hennessey was arrested and
made affidavit that he bound and gagged
the woman at her own request, and pro
duced a note from her to that effect. Her
purported object waa a ."josh" , on her
husband, but lt came ; to the police that
there are other things- back of the strange
proceeding.
To-day. Hennessey was arraigned and
Mrs." Basch and her husband positively
refused to appear. The woman pleaded
illness, 'disrobed, went to bed and the of
ficers were turned away. The. family doc
tor was called upon by the police and he
gave a- certificate to the effect that Mrs.
Basch was not too ill to appear. There
upon a bench warrant was issued for the
couple and an ambulance sent to bring
her In and she was taken to court with
out dressing. She declared that she would
rot in Jail rathtr than appear; but 'she and
her husband to-night gave $500 bond each
to be on hand Monday, when the case, will
be called again.' ' â¢.
The police declare there Is too much
crime to work out false alarms and they
propose to make an example of this case.

San Francisco People Receiving^ the
Fall Benefit.
There have been many cases like the
following in San FrancisOo. Every one
relates the experience of people we know.
These plain, straightforward statements
will do much toward relieving the suf-
fering of thousands. Such testimony will
be read with interest by many people.
A. C. F. Bernecker, miner of 742_Iioward
street, says: '.'There came to my notice
some time ago an undoubted case of kid-
ney and bladder trouble, where the party
was so annoyed from the kidney secre-
tions, particularly at night, that it en-
tailed loss of sleep and as a consequence
lack of energy ensued the following day.
The kidney "secretions contained so much
acid that they scalded; in fact, some-
times were particularly painful. A course
of the treatment of Doan's Kidney Pills
was taken and much to the surprise of
ttie party and more to Ms, gratification
the incontinence ceased. '

Interesting Experiment in a Restau-
rant. Â¦
An advertising agent, representing: a
prominent New York magazine, while on
; a recent western trip, was dining one
evening in a Pittsburg restaurant.
While waitine for his order he glanced
over his newspaper and noticed the ad-
vertisement of a well known dyspepsia
preparation, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets; a3 he himself was a regular user
of the tablets, he began speculating as
to how many of the other traveling men
In the dining room were also friends of
the popular remedy for indigestion.
He says: I counted twenty-three men
at the tables and In the hotel office I
took the trouble to Interview them and
was surprised to learn that nine of the
twenty-three made a practice of taking
ona or two of Stuart's Dyepepsia Tab-
lets after each meal.
One of them told me he had suffered so
much from stomach trouble that at one
time he had been obliged *to quit the
road, but since using Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets had been entirely free from in-
digestion, but he continued their use, es-
pecially while traveling, on account of
irregularity in meals and because like all
traveling men he was often obliged to eat
what he coud get and not always what
he wanted.
Another, who looked the ' picture of
health, said he never ate a meal without
taking a Stuart Tablet afterward be-
cause he could eat what he pleased and
when he pleased without fear of a sleep- |
less night or any other trouble.
Still another used them because he was |
subject to gas on stomach, causing pres- ;
sure on heart and lungs, shortness of
breath and distress in chest, which he
no longer experienced since using the
tablets regularly.
Another claimed that Stuart's Dyspep-
sia Tablets was the only safe remedy he
had ever found for sour stomach and
acidity. He had formerly used Common
soda to relieve the trouble, but the tab-
lets were much better and safer to use.
After smoking, drinking or other ex-
cesses which weaken -the digestive or-
gans, nothing restores the stomach to a
healthy, wholesome condition so effectual-
ly as Stuart's Tablets.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain the
natural digestives, pepsin, diastase, which
every weak stomach lacks, as well as
nux, hydrastin and yellow parilla, and :
can be safely relied on as a radical
cure for every form of poor digestion.
Sold by druggists everywhere.

to know of the wonders accomplished by
Lydia E* Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
" Deab Mrs. Phtkham : â I cannot tell you with pen and ink what good
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound did for me, suffering from
the ills peculiar to the sex, extreme lassitude and that all gone feeling. I
would rise from xnr bed in the morning feeling more tired than when I â¢went
to bed. but before* I had used two bottles of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound. I began to feel the buoyancy of my younger days return-
ing, became regular, could do more work and not feel tired than f had ever
been able to do before, so I continued to use it until I was restored to perfect
health. It is indeed a boon to sick women and I heartily recommend it.

Sustains Fatal Injuries During a

ST. LOUIS. Oct. 21â The first fatality
to occur on a local football field had Its
climax. to-day, when John WIthnell, quar
terback of the St. Louis University team,
died after an operation at St. Anthony's
School.
Withnell's Injuries were sustained in
practice Tuesday, . when he was kicked
on the spine and his neck wrenched. The
Injury was entirely accidental. Â¦
QUARTERBACK WITHNELL
DIES AFTER AN. OPERATION
â¢ It will be only under harmonious condi
tions that prominent turfmen will go to
the Los Angeles track and a definite an
nouncement Is" anxiously awaited. Some
will race at both Los Angeles and San
Francisco during the winter if such a
campaign is found feasible, but there are
few who would attend any. meeting that
would clash with the older and estab
lished meeting.
Jockey Arthur Redfern, who has been
at the head of the Jockey force in the
stable of W. C. Whitney for the past sea
son. Is one of the prominent Jockeys who
will race at Los Angeles should the con
ditions be favorable, although he will
also be seen during the season at San
Francisco. Los Angeles was chosen on
account of the condition of Mrs. Red
fern, his mother.
In the steeplechase division such horses
as are raced during the winter will be
seen at California and it is assured that
this picturesque end of racing will have
many representatives. Many of the good
crosÂ»9 country horses are always retired
at the close of the metropolitan season,
but this year a greater number than
usual will be seen with the colors up.
Many stables will remain in the East
until the close of the New York season at
Aqueduct before making the trip across
the continent. Others will pot leave until
the close of the meeting at "Washington.
There is a general desire among horse
men to' go to San Francisco and many
Eastern stables that have ln former years
gone into retirement for the winter
months will put in the season there.
In the matter of Jockeys there Is the
same excellent prospect and when Oak
land opens its season next month It is as
sured that most of. the best riders of the
East will be on hand. Among those who
have already definitely announced that
they would ride at San Francisco are
Frank O'Neill, Tommy Burns, John Bull
man, Charlie Gray, J. Daly and M. Daly.
This list will be . considerably swelled
within a few days.w
HORSEMEN ARE INTERESTED.
President Thomas H. Williams of the
New California Jockey Club has. been ln
New York for several days Interesting
horsemen. He has met with rare suc
cess. "Jake" Holtman, the starter. Is
also on the ground for the purpose of us
ing his efforts. Both gentlemen have said
that never was missionary work easier
nor more pleasant. All the stakes have
received liberal entries and in the mat
ter of quality as well as quantity the
East will have an excellent representa
tlon. Starter Holtman visited St. Louis
before coming to New York and he re
ports that there will be an unusually large
number of horses leave for San Fran
cisco from that city.
. In discussing the Los. Angeles racing
venture for the winter Holtman expressed
the opinion that such a meeting would
be thoroughly successful. He does not
consider it would be a business rival of
the San Francisco tracks, for the reason
that there is every prospect of having
horses enough to - keep all the racing
plants exceedingly busy. Each year there
has been great additions to the ranks of
horses that race the season round, and
in his opinion the' more reputable winter
tracks there are the better It will be for
the sport ln general. '
President Williams has been quoted as
being at perfect harmony with the Los
Angeles track, provided Its promoters
agree to race under the rules and Juris
diction of the New California Jockey
Club. The Impression is general that this
demand will be promptly met and that
there will be perfect harmony throughout
the winter season.
The season* has seen several valuable
recruits to the sport and many of them
will race during the winter months. E. R.
Thomas, who purchased Hermis for $60,000
as the head of his stable, will probably
have his colors at San Francisco, al
though he has made no definite announce
ment of his intentions. Alex Shields has
the care of his horses, and as he has
been a coast regular It is assured that if
the Thomas horses race at all this winter
they will perform on the California
tracks.
In the many recent changes made by
Eastern owners new stables will spring
up this winter and California will get the
lion's share of the patronage. Trainers
who have found themselves without an
occupation by reason of the retirement of
their employers are branching out as
owners and most of them will race horses
thl3 winter. _

own with the Eastern cracks. "Doc"
Rowell followed with San .Francisco as

The performance of Dan Patch was a
surprise to even his most ardent admirers.
The betting on the. trial was 3 to 6 that
he would not boat his own record "of 1:59.
He went the mile with so little apparent
exertion that .to-night his admirers are
predicting he will .still further lower' the
world's record should he start against It
with weather and ;track conditions . favor
able as they were. to-day. Summary:
against time. The pacer clipped
three-quarters of a second from the
world's record of 1:57, held by Prince
Alert, and lowered his own record by 2%
seconds. The mile was paced Â¦ without
wind shields and at the finish Dan Patch
seemed fresh and vigorous.
The demonstration that greeted the, new
world's pacing champion as he flashed
under the wire was a memorable one.
Worse owners who stood about the track
had caught the time with their watches
and before . the official time flashed out
across the track they set up a shout and
threw their hats and caps In the air. The
shout was caught up by the people In the
grand stand and on the clubhouse grounds
and the victory of the new pacing idol
was proclaimed in shouts of applause
that reached their climax as Driver Mc
.Henry pulled up before the judges* stand
and doffed his hat In acknowledgment.
The trial was made with two runners to
set the pace, the sulky preceding the
pacer carrying a canvas strip between the
wheels. The quarter was reached in :29,
th,e half in :58 and the three-quarters pole
ln 1:27%} As the horses swung Into -the
stretch Dan Patch was pressing the for
ward runner so closely that scarcely a
hand's- breadth Intervened between his
nose and the back of the driver ln the
forward sulky. Â¦

Peter's baseball cripples were nosed out
at the finish again yesterday, afternoon
at Recreation â¢ Park, and, just aa on the
precei'.llng day, they m rallied at the
eleventh hour. It came too late, however,
and furthermore, Oscar Graham did not
rc-eporid with a Â¦ bingle when the sacks
were all decorated with tailenders. Score â
Sacramento 4, Oakland 3.
The cripples should have won In a
walk !f hitting counts for anything in a
ball game. . Twelve times did they land
on the offerings of the budding Mr. Keefe
and, besides,' he issued many passes. But
for; all that, the Senators brought homu
the money with half the number of hits.
Fourteen, men left on bases proved dis
astrous for Peter.
, I Both teams made a run in the fourth.'
Then, during: the progress of the fifth,
the cripples landed with another one and
held the lead till the eighth, when the
Senators broke up the game. Sheehan
led off with a single and Graham bunted.
Gorton executed a wild throw and both
were safe. Keefe and Hogan died with
out a struggle, and it soomed the Sen
ators might not make good.^
Casey then beat out a little dinky hit
and tilled up the bags. The crowd yelled
for 'action and Hildebrand gave It to
them In the shape of a, dazzler to left,
which sent Sheehan and Graham sprint
ing home and sent Casey to third. Then
Graham took a' trip In the clouds, and
while he was making a wild pitch Casey
sneaked in.
The cripples looked strong In the ninth.
Messerly slid in a hit to the right
garden and Martinke shot one out to
left.' Moskiman forced Messerly at sec
ond, but Gorton drew a pass and filled
the bases. It was Graham's try at the
club and the best he had was a fly to
Doyle, and that ended it all.
- Ike Rockenfield, late of Tacoma, made
his first, bow In one of Peter's suits. He
played left field, as he said that his wing
was a little stiff, after his long journey,
and he did not want to butt into third
base without a chance to rest up. Dever
eaux and McDonald indulged in a little
battle of words at the end of the eighth
round and the brlndle one left the lot on
the arm of a copper. The score:
Oakland â 1 Sacramento â

After knocking at the door on several
occasions. TroyÂ» from George Gilbert's
string, finally made connections with a
purse. The gelding got mixed up with
a ragged lot in the third selection and at
odds of 3 to 5 came home on the thin
strap. Judge Napton, the pacemaker,
lasted out long enough to down Achilles
for the place.
In the Introductory two-year-old scram
ble Rudolfo, from the stable of W. J.
Spiers, spreadeagled his field. The Amlgo
youngster was held on an even money
chance, and Waterbury rode him as if
his life depended on the result. Half a
dozen lengths behind the winner at the
finish. El Corteza caught and beat out
the tiring Lady Usk for the place.
Bookmaker Caesar Young's filly, Little
Margaret, met defeat again in the six
furlong run following. She was a heavily
played 7 to 10 chance and was beaten In,
a gallop by Maresa, the -third choice. On
Wednesday Maddox rode Maresa, finish
ing third. To-day Prawley had the
mount. Skirmish, the second choice, ran
an indifferent third.
IjOS ANGELES, Oct. 22,-Owner Harry
Stover's trained bird. Kenilworth. had
his wings clipped in the seven-furlong
handicap at Agricultural Park this after
noon. The official adjuster ot weights
asked him to pick up 12S pounds, and,
even with this amount of freight to han
dle, the public pounded his price down
from even money to 7 to 10.
For three quarters of a mile his notes
were sweet and clear as ever, then he
gave up the lead to Warte Nlcht and
hopped up on hla perch. Big Bill Knapp
rode a waiting race with Warte Nlcht
and breezed in by the stand In 1:28-%.
With twenty yards more to cover Kenil
worth would have been third, for he Just
did get a head decision over Solon for
the place. Princess Tltania showed to
advantage in the race, and next time out
will be hard to subdue*. Constellator ran
disappointingly.
The harness horse* were offered no op
portunity to parade. Six running events
were decided, of which number favorite's
took half the card. The weather was
fine and the track in excellent condition.

fSd Jo*ThirdÂ°i CaU aRANT Bfeua ca. *iQUARRELS WITH HUSBAND,
THEN SWALLOWS POISON
Mr?. Corina Robinson, . a handsome
young woman. 20 years old, ended her ex
istence by swallowing a- two-ounce bottle
of carbolic add last night shortly before
midnight. The woman was taken to the
Harbor Hospital, where she died soon aft
erward. A trivial quarrel with her hus
band prompted her to end her life.
' Mrs. Robinson and her husband. Thomas
Robinson, an employ^: of the American"
Biscuit Company, were seen on Broad
way late Ia3t night. They were engaged
In a heated argument and finally the
young wife abruptly left her husband and
went hurriedly to their home.
A few minutes after the woman had en
tered her house Deputy Coroner Tom Da
vis, who resides next door, heard groans
coming from the direction of the Robin
son abode. He hastened to Investigate
and found the woman lying on the door
step, an empty bottle at her side. She
was removed to the Harbor Hospital, but
died a few minutes after her arrival there.
The husband of the woman was,grief
stricken over the tragedy and stated that
Ive had only . spoken one cross word to
his wife and that he did not mean to
abuse her. She had never threatened to
take her own life, according to Robinson's
statement.
". Probably the most effective address de
livered during the evening was that made
by Thomas McConnell. He Is a Union
Labor man. yet he espoused ' the cause of
Henry 'J; Crocker because of - the \ alleged
perfidy of Mayor E.'.E. Schmitz and the
false position occupied by , Franklin J K.
Lane/ the candidate of Gavin McNab.' .
John S. Partridge, one of the party
orators, made an effective speech to the
assemblage. He pointed out the absolute
necessity of uphofding the party of Roose
velt, as it meant bread and butter to the
workingmen of the city. He declared that
prosperity had come to this city because
of the wisdom of the Republican national
policy. He extolled the candidates on the
municipal ticket and advised his auditors
that it would be to their, interest to elect
the entire ticket.
Theodore 8. Lunstedt also addressed the
voters and was^ given a kindly reception.
Mr. Lunstedt said, if elected Supervisor
he would administer the duties of his of
fice In a manner that would be an honor
to the city and himself. ' Fred Eggers,
candidate for Supervisor, Harry. . Baehr,
Louis Jacobs, William E. Lutz and other
leading candidates addressed the meeting.
LABORER INDORSES CROCKER.
Judge Van Nostrand presided over a
very good Republican . meeting in Ein
tracht Hall on Twelfth street, near Fol
som, last nigh$. This district is strong
ly union labor, but the citizens turned
out and listened to the standard bearer
and judged for themselves what manner
of man he ia. That Mr. Crocker- Im
pressed his audience is putting it mildly.-
He aroused them to enthusiasm and even
those who are opposed to his candidacy
listened attentively to his address and
applauded his sentiments.
Mr. Crocker made an appeal to the vot
ers In behalf of good government. He
said this would not be his last visit to
their section of the city, as he wanted to
learn of its needs and see that they are
looked after. His address was short and
to the point. He did not assail the other
candidates, nor did he praise them. He
simply made a manly appeal for the votes
of his constituents and promised If elect
ed Mayor of the city he would give the
people an honorable administration. Mr.
Crocker was cheered at all times and
was gratified at the generous reception
he received. < . ;
Thomas McConnell Says the Mayor
Is Not a Friend of Labor.
CRITICIZES SCHMITZ.
Henry turned and said: "Xp, don't do that.
I guess I had better Rive you five hundred
more." He had already subscribed $1000 to
the fund, but he sent his check In promptly
for the extra ?000, as he had suggested. Now
don't that show that Henry J. Crocker has al
ways been liberal and thoughtful of the labor
ing man when he Is In distress? In my opin
ion it 4oeÂ» decidedly, and I think he deserves
credit for It. There is not the least doubt in
my mind that he will be th- next Mayor of
San Francisco.
I see that lots of men are busily enraged
now in raking up all the good things they
ever did In the way of generosity or benevo
lence of some eort, and it seems to me- that
Henry J. Crocker ought to get his share of
the credit for a few things that I know he
ban done to help the city and its worklngmen.
A number of years ago, when tho hard times
were uron us and everything was being done
that could be to give the po<ir Idle men work.
I was president of the Boulevard Association
that was employing Idle men to build the bou
levard, now known as the Dewey Houlevard,
extending from the Almshcuse to Inglesldn.
The money to pay these men a dollar a day
and tlve them an existence Instead of soup
house charity, wa* beln* subscribed by citi
zens of San Francisco. The Boulevard Asso
ciation had an arrangement with . the Mayor
whereby the money being raised by subscrip
tion wa* to be turne* over to the association
through William W. Bunker, and ex-Mayor
Ellert, John McCord and myself hired the men,
superintended thorn and paw that they did
their work, while Ellert and Bunker paid them.
We were employinc from 200 to 7W men,
who would otherwise, have been idle, and Mc-
Cord and myself were at the scene of opera
tions early every morning and spent a good
part of the day there. One morning Henry J.
Crocker drove out to this boulevard, as he
wus in the habit of doing frequently. He
asked McCord how we were setting along. The
answer was, ' J Very well." Crocker then asked
how many men we were employing;. We re
plied. "About 700." but we were much afraid
we should have to let some of them go, as
Ellert and Bunker, had reported that the sub
scription funds wherewith to pay them were
coming in much more slowly than they had
been.
Every day as the campaign progresses
It brings forward some business
man who is S anxious to show his
appreciation of what Henry J.
Crocker has done for the city
and its worklngmen in the past. The lat
est is Charles C. Bemis, president of the
Consolidated Giant Powder Company,
who knew whereof he epoke when he said
at his office in the Hayward building
yesterday: â¢

CROCKER'S GENEROSITY.
LOCAL LIQUOR DEALERS.
Sixteen Nominees for Supervisor In
dorsed by Association.
The California Liquor Dealers' Associa
tion and the Royal Arch met at B'nai
B'rith Hall yesterday afternoon. Four
hundred dealers were present. The asso
ciation indorsed the following Republican
nominees for Supervisor: Theodore Lun
stedt, FrÂ«d N. Bent, George Alpers, Fred
Eggers. L. A. Rea, Edward H. Algeltin
ger and Charles Eoxton.
The following Democratic nominees
were indorsed: John A. Lynch, A. Comte,
S. Braunhart, Edward R. Rock. George
B. JlcClellan, A. A. d'Ancona, H. U.
Brandensteln and Oscar Hocks.
'Thomas F. Finn, a nominee for Super
visor on the Union Labor ticket, was also
Indorsed.
After considerable discussion the liquor
dealers decided to make no Indorsement
of other candidates. It is reported that
Henry J. Crocker would have received In
dorsement for Mayor if a vote on that
issue had been taken. There was, how
ever, a strong array of Schmitz men
present. Neither side was # qulte sure of
the result, hence by common consent a
clash was not precipitated.
Bahrs Club Organized.
, The Bahrs Club of the Thirty-sixth As
sembly District was organized at Har
mony Hall last night. "W. A. Stone was
elected president. Three hundred voter3
attended, signed the roll cf the organiza
tion and pledged themselves to work; vig
orously to bring about the election ut
George H. Bahrs to the office of Assessor.
In the course of his speech Mr| McCon
ncll said: .
Mr. Chairman, Ladles and Gentlemen: It is
not often that a worklngman is called upon a
public platform to address his fellows.Nind as
sptechmaklng in not in our line of . business,
I therefore would beg your Indulgence for a
few minutes while I answer in my own way
the question I have been asked, "Why am I
not /In with the Union Labor party?"
When the Union Labor party was formed
two years ego my union, the Journeymen Ship
wrights' Association, was not In politics alid
never had been and never will be, I hope. But
when the. union men of this city did form a
party and put a ticket in the field the mem
bers of my union considered It their duty to
"buckle on their armor" and get on-tha firing
line with their fellows and assist In every way
to make a nurceFS of the Union Labor party
and to elect the Union Labor ticket. During
that campaign our union did something that
It had never done before during the nfty years
of . its existence in this city. We called a spe
cial meeting for the purjiose fit inviting Eugene
E. Bchmltz and the other Union Labor candi
dates to attend and address our members... '
Mayor Schmitz and the other candidates at
tended and we gave them a very enthusiastic
reception. I presided at that meeting and dur
ing the campaign I attended numerous other
meetings and spoke In favor of the Union La
bor ticket. It did not take us long after elec
tion to find that the Union Labor party was a
bubble and a snare. At that" time our union
had a serious problem to solve. It was a mat
ter that was Etrlklng at the very existence of
our union. It was a matter of two scab
Fhipyards, one in Alameda.and the other in
Oakland, endeavoring,- nnd succeeding In . a
great measure. In taking away from San Fran
cisco and the union men of this city generally,
and also the business men. the work on the
repairing of shlpn ' on the water front of this
city.* to be done In Oakland and Alameda by
scats.' They were endeavoring to rob us ship
wrights of our means of obtaining â¢ a living.
They were endeavoring to take the. very bread
and' butter out of the mouths of ourselves and
famlllfe. â¢ " ' . . , .; - .:' ...' ".
SOHMITZ'S DEAF EAR.
Naturally, - we were greatly agitated .over
this. We called several meetings and wrestled
with the question as best we could. The names
of several prominent men were, mentioned. In
cluding Mayor Schmitz, to whom we might
look for assistance and advice. We looked upon
Schmitz as our Mayor, the Union Labor man
for whom we had aone so much and whosu
expressions of grand sentiment in his Inaugural
address carried us away. He promised us that
he would try to Â«ee that the water front should
be brought -under the control qf the city ami
that goods . of home manufacture should have
the preference. Our union finally decided to'do
everything In Its power to hold the work in
San Francisco. ; A large Bum of money was
set aside | to pay . the ; expenses of having , that
business : properly attended Â¦ to, and I was ap
pointed and given full power to act in all mat
ters concerning this business. My first act was
to address the following letter â¢ to Mayor
Schmitz: -Â¦ .. ' ....

And there the rjuasaion rested so far as
Mayor 8chmitz and our association was con
cerned. Neither our nssoclatlon nor myself have
ever heArd a word or received a line from
Mayor Schmitz on the subject. But we grot
along very well without. Mayor Scfcmltz. We
made a erallant 'fiRht Rzalnst those scab ship

the City Federation, we won out, hands down,
and succeeded In making: Union yards and men
in both places.
A HOT AIB MA YOB.
That Is our experience with the Labor Union
Mayor.' Now we arc told that there is a Labor
Union ticket in the field, with that "tried and
true" hot air dlsoenser at Its head, aftd he Is
trying- to make the worklnsmen of this city
believe that there Is a Union Labor party now
In existence.
A v short time aero the Union Labor men de
cided to watt upon Mayor Sehmltr and ask
him the question whether he was â¢ with them
or against them. On August ~T, 1D02, the Union
Labor Central Club ; told the worklnsmen of
this city, over the slsnatures of their commit
tee â T. Zante,;H.M. Burnett and Harry A.
Knoxâ that the Ruef- Parry wing of the Union
Labor party were pirates. Â¦â¢;.:<.-
George Ahlers of tf.e Teamsters* Union and
Mr. Morlarity ; of â¢ the Engineers' tells us that
Ruef and Parry are bolstering up a tottering
cause, and Mr. Holland of > the Hackmen de
nounce* Parry and Ruef as traitors.
And now that noiseless inventor of the polit
ical machine, 'Gavin McNab, puts forward onco
again his man, 'Franklin K. Lane, and the Ex- 
aminer, tells us why Franklin K. Lane should
be elected Mayor ; of . this city. ' and ' tells the
people of San Francisco that they are fortunate
on this occasion to have at their service a man
who understands the powers of the office, and
that man U Franklin K. Lane, and Gavin Me-
Nab la saying nothlnsr, but ' is sawing wood.'
Mr. Lane te'.is. us that the City: will not be
turned over to -the bosses who want graft. The
Examiner telU us that Mr. Larip's chief oppo
nent is Mr. Henry J.- Crocker, a man who, Is
untrained. But theJStaminer told us last year
that Franklin K. Lane wa_ trained by Gavin
McNab and that he has for a long time been
one of McNab' s trusted lieutenants.
; We nre - told that Mr. Lane ia touring the

that Mr" Lane, considering his backers ' and
trainersâ the Bulletin, the Examiner and Gavin
McNab â would be ashamed to put his nose near

REPUBLICAN RALLY Td-NIGHT I
SCHMITZ'S* CAMPAIGN.
Mayor Spends Evening After Votes
in Mission.
Mayor Schmitz is making a vigorous
campaign. Last night he spoke at two
large meetings, one in Ocean View and
one In the Mission. The first meeting was
held at Wolfs Hall at Ocean View. There
was a large crowd present and when the
Mayor arrived It gave vent to a series of
cheers. % -â
Schmitz spoke at length on the issues
and his speech was received with much
applause. He said:
We have no newspapers with us in this
fight. Hut we care not for that, we shall be
victorious without them. I care not . to sea
my name written In the black headlines of
any paper, what I want and what I have
striven for during my two years' Â«Â«imlnhtra
tlon is to have my name written deep in the
hearts of the wage earners, the plain people
of o'Jr city.
I Bald two years ago that if I was. elected
I would deal lalrly and squarely with all. I
did so. There were no police rldln- on the
street cars at the time of the strike, as there
was during the teamsters' strike under the
Phelan-McXab rule. When the officials of
the street car companies came to me and
asked for policemen to act as motormen and
conductors on their cars I refused them. I
told them that I would keep peace without any
such measures. After eight days of peace, the
carmen acting as peace committees them
selves, the strike was peaeeaoly settled with
satisfaction to both sides. /
We have had many labor troubles during my
administration, but the police were never neces
sary to Insure peace and order. There was
no bloodshed nor rioting.
I am proud to act as a representative for
you men. you wage earners, and I am ever
your servant, to do your bidding. . 1 shall al
ways consider it an honor to senre the people
from whose ranks I have risen.
I am not making a mud-slinglng campaign,
as my opponents are doing. Do not place any
credence in the lies of the paid newspapers,
for they are paid. That is the reason we
have no newspaper to back us in this fight,
because we are not millionaires. Pay no at
tention to the lying circulars that are being
scattered broadcast about the city.
Place In office men who will, look out for
all the people and not grant favors to any
class.
I have done all I could to better the roads
in this district and would have accomplished
mora had I had a Board of Supervisors to
work in harmony with me. I always believed
In giving the small property owner as much
consideration as the lame one. The laws are
madÂ« for the weak and not the strong. The
strong can take care of themselve?. They
were made to protect the weak from the op
presylon of the stronst and we nev><! men la
office to see that they are enforced.
If I am re-elected I intend to go on with
the good work I have been doing.
On tie one side you have a millionaire, the
tool of the moneyed men of the city, on the
other your humble servant. I do not consider
Lane in the campaign at all, as he has not
a possible chance of election.
The conditions are better to-day than they
were two years ago. Don't chantre for some
thing you know nothing about. ' Don't change,
but help the Union Labor ticket to be elected
straight down the line. Do everything for
the party which stands for your people. Don't
let any paid emissary mislead you. or even
come among you. Vote the .atralsrht ticket
and help me to keep up the good work for
this great cause. I am your servant and al
ways will be the friend of. the plain people.
Powel Fredrick made a brief speech. In
which he pointed to an alleged deficit in
the funds of the 'present County Clerk's
office to the extent of S30.0CO and a short
age of $70,000 In the fees of the office.
G. I* Antagne acted a3 chairman, and
others "who. spoke were Harry Knox,
Frank Conklin, Frank Jewell. J. J. Con
nolly, John "Rutherford. Miles Farland,
W. W. Coff ey and G. G. Vickerson.
The other meeting was held at Silk's
Hall on Preclta avenue, near Mission
street. A large crowd was present and
the same speakers that appeared at
Ocean View addressed the. meeting.

Franklin K. Lane addressed three meet-
Ings last night and at each one he was
received by an enthusiastic audience.
He made his y first speecji to the voters
of the Fortieth' Assembly District at Oak
wood ; Hall, 1805 Devlsadero street. He
opened up his talk by refuting the
charges of Judge A. P. Van Duser, made
in his speech on Wednesday night. He
stated that he had never received . one
cent of the $25,000 provided- by the city
for the city's suit against the Spring Val
ley Water Works. He then referred to
the manner In which the. Union Labor
party was being managed and wound np
by. stating, that he was pleased to see . In
his audience * many voters k who had .de

election now returning ' to ; their old field.

be granted one. The commissioners I shall
appoint will be appointed with due regard to
their fitness for the office and not to any
political pull. I thank you.
The meeting closed with cheers for the
standard bearer and the rest of the
ticket. . ; " ,
REPUBLICAN STANDARD BEARER, CANDIDATES FOR PUBLIC AD
MINISTRATOR AND AUDITOR, AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE
SHIPWRIGHTS' ASSOCIATION WHO EXPOSED NOMINEES OF THE
UNION LABOR AND DEMOCRATIC PARTIES.
HENRY J. CROCKER, Republican
nominee, Is steadily gaining
strength in the race -for Mayor
1 of San Francisco. Members of
the Republican campaign . com
mittee meet daily at headquarters, 16
Geary street, and carefully consider re
ports from the various sections of the
city. The purpose of the committee Is to
ascertain the exact truth regarding
situation, and every member of the com
mittee understands that the biggest fool
in politics is the man who deliberately
deceives himself. The reports received at
headquarters from trustworthy sources
justify the prediction that Mr. Crocker
will receive a handsome plurality on No
vember 3.
The Democratic papers are bending
their energies to discover a few Repub
lican business men who are not actively
supporting # the candidacy of Henry J.
Crocker, but success Is not attending the
effort. Two men have'been Introduced to
the public as Republican merchants who
favor the election of Mr. Lane, but space
largely In excess of two columns has
been employed in presenting their names
to' the people.
DEMOCRATS FOB CROCKER.
The Republican campaign committee is
in possession of definite Information that
many leading Democratic citizens have
resolved to vote for Mr. Crocker. Posi
tive intelligence is received to the effect
that many prominent worklngmen who
supported Eugene E. Schmitz two years
ago intend to vote for Henry J. Crocker
on November 3. The names were not ob
tained for publication and may not be
published.
The reports published In the McNab
press to the effect that Lane Is drawing
considerable strength from the Union
Labor ranks are not true. McNab may
the business men to have confidence in the way
that our city government Is conducted. We
wont to encourage them to Invest their money
and thereby make work for ourselvrj and
bring prosperity and happiness to all the peo
ple of this city.
To do that we will have to place a business
man at the head of our city governmentâ a
man that we know to be manly, courageous and
jlncere, broad, liberal and truly American.
The Republican party has placed such a man
at thÂ« head of the ticket, and that man is
Henry J. Crocker. The Republican party has
placed a ticket in the field with Henry J.
Crocker at Its head, that we know carrlea the
confidence of all the people with it, and we
know that every interest of the city will be
safe in its hands. Therefore, it !Â» our duty on
election day to go to the polls and vote the
straight Republican ticket and then go on our
way rejoicing.
have a few men staked out for transfer
to the Democratic column when Lane
begins his "whlrhvind finish." but the
facts are that Schmlfz's candidacy is for
midable. The contest now on Is between
Crocker and Schmitz. The betting men
have sized up the fight. They figure
that Lane's chances of success are very
remote. This talk of a "whirlwind fin
ish"* for Lane is nonsense. Politicians
saw Lane's finish the very Instant the
Union Labor party put a candidate of
its own In the field.
LANE'S FINISH.
The original McNab programme was
framed on the presumption that Casey
would win the works In the Union Labor
party aAd stand In for Democratic
fusion with Lane aa the nominee for
Mayor. The triumph of the Schmita
forces at the primary fight upset all the
calculations of Boss McNab. The Demo
cratic boss saw Lane's finish when he
held him In the flght. and It matters
little whether it Is called a whirlwind
finish or a mild blowout. Sensible Demo
crats, desiring the prosperity and bet
terment of the city, will lend their sup
port to Mr. Crocker In this campaign.
Votes given to Lane will be thrown away.
There are Indications at this time that
the Republican vote on November 3 will
approximate _5,000. The number of regis
tered Republicans Is about 30.000. The
good attendance at Republican meetings
In the very heart of the big Union Labor
districts signifies a change in public sen
timent which Is exceedingly favorable to
the Republican cause. The party organ
ization in every district of the city Is ef
fective. The prediction is made at Re
publican headquarters that Crocker will
carry the Twenty-eighth Assembly Dis
trict. Big Republican majorities In the
Thirty-eighth. Thirty-ninth. Fortieth,
Forty-first, Forty-second and Forty-third
districts are foreshadowed.
Louis Samuels acted as chairman of the
meeting. Others who spoke were Judge
Cabanlss. Dr. Dodge. P. J. Curtis. T.
Carey Friedlander and Judge Mogan.
Candidate Lane next addressed the vot
ers of the Twenty-eighth Assembly Dis
trict at the Sailors' Union Hall, on East
and Mission streets. While his speech
here was listened to with rapt attention
for the most part, there were cries from
the audience of "We don't want _ Abe
Ruef to manage us!" and other ejacula
tions of a similar nature. Lane caught
the spirt and sentiment of the occasion
and told his auditors that now there was
really no Union Labor party. Schmitz
represented merely an outline of the real
Intention of that party, and the vital In
terests of that organization had practi
cally gone back to the source from which
they came and that was the good old
standard Democratic party.
His third meeting was at Saratoga Hall,
on Geary street, near Larkin. where he
spoke to the voters of the Forty-second
Assembly District. Here ho received a
fine greeting, although It was very late
when he arrived.
Just as he was about to begin his re
marks a lady In the gallery called out.
"Lane's the man!" He Immediately took
this for a cue and started his speech by
saying. "This is the greatest compliment
that has been handed to me since I en
tered into this campaign. When the wo
men of this county come to our political
meetings it shows that they take an In
terest in the welfare of the city's govern
ment and that they want to see an honest
administration of the affairs of this great
municipality. I wish all the women In the
city would come and take a hand In the
proceedings and voice their sentiments at
these meetings."
He wound up his remarks by asking all
good Democrats and all hia honest Repub
lican friends to come to the rescue of good
law and good administration and help
swell the Democratic vote at the coming
election. "â¢â¢-"'''
J. M. Burnett was chairman of the meet
ing. Among those who spoke were Judge
Mogan. E. Godchaux. William Brodeiick.
Dr. D'Ancona, P. J. Curtis. A. H. Wche,
T. Cary Friedlander and Oscar Hocks.
eral Salomon was interrupted time and
again with applause and when he con
cluded he was given hearty applause.
Harry Baehr, candidate for Auditor,
proved himself a popular man. When he
was introduced to the big audience the
enthusiasm was remarkable. The as
semblage never seemed to tire of calling
his name and applauding him. In his ad
dress he told his auditors that ho had
kept every promise he had made them
while running for the office two years
ago and reiterated that if re-elected he
would continue to conduct his office in an
honorable and efficient manner.
HEABTY RECEPTION.
Maurice L. Asher was also at home In
this district and his reception was a
hearty one. Asher made one cf his usu- i
ally good campaign speeches and was ap
plauded throughout by his friends. Rob
ert Vance and Fred Eggers, candidates
for Supervisor, were given warm wel
comes and spoke at length. They devoted
much of their speech to a eulogy of Hen
ry J. Crocker. Louis Jacobs was in the
midst of telling- the assemblage that the
Fortieth Assembly District would give the
largest majority for Henry J. Crocker,
and thus capture the banner, when the
Republican standard bearer made his ap
pearance in the hall. The scene at this
juncture was an animated one. Every one
was standing and cheering. â¢
Flags and handkerchiefs were waved by
the ladies and the men swung their hats
and yelled for the nominee. It was with
difficulty that Mr. Crocker could make his
way to the platform. Hands were out
stretched to grasp the next Mayor's hand
and he smilingly paused to receive the
personal greetings of his friends.
When quiet was once more restored
Isidore Golden was introduced, and In
clear cut sentences paid his respects to
Franklin K. Lane and Mayor Schmitz. He
said that Lane had not attended to busi
ness during the five years he has held of
fice and was unfitted for the office of
Mayor of a growing municipality. He
said some very Â«3harp things about the
Democratic candidate, that muBt have
burned the lattcr's ears.
In speaking of Schmitz he eaid the
present Mayor had appointed Commis
sioners who had proved false to their
trust. He raid Mayor Schmitz was per
sonally responsible and should not be
given another opportunity to make mis
takes. He said that Franklin K. Lane
had charged during the present campaign
that corruption existed in the city gov
ernment Young Golden assorted that the
Democratic and Union â¢ Labor parties
were responsible for this, as they have
been in power during the last six years.
He said this would be changed If the Re
publicans were given a chance. Golden
aroused a great deal of applause and was
highly complimented by older Repub
licans for the able manner In. which he
had set forth his views.
Judge Joachimson was cheered and
made a short speech. He reminded his
auditors of his record on the bench and
suggested in a modest way that if they
de<?med he was worthy of their support to
vote for his election to the position to
which he aspires. Theodore Lunstedt,
candidate for Supervisor, made a clean
cut speech in which he proved to the sat
isfaction of the crowd that Henry J.
Crocker was not an aristocrat. He told
those present that it was the duty of
every Republican to go to the polls on
November 3 and vote the entire Repub
lican ticket. Dr. T. H. Morris, candidate
for Coroner, was introduced and promised
if elected Coroner he would do nothing
that would bring discredit upon his ad
ministration. He promised many reforms
and the doing away of present conditions
that are In vogue in the City Morgue.
THE LEADER SPEAKS.
Chairman Cross next introduced Henry
J. Crocker and the audience let out Us
pent-up enthusiasm for the candidate for
Mayor. It was some timp before he
could secure stillness In the hall. When
the noise had subsided he spoke as fol
lows: â¢
If I have the united indorsement of the peo
ple of San Fr&ncUco as I have the united In
dorsement of the candidates who have spoken
to-nlrht we know what we will do to the
other people. (Applause and laughter.) In
talking to the people of the Fortieth District
I am talking pretty close to my home. I
am talking to people whom I see nearlv every
day and I guess they have seen a great deal
more of me than they have heard me talk. I
don't think you will hear me talk very much
to-nicht, but what I do 'say comes lrom my
htart. I am a candidsAe before the people
of Ban Francisco at this time because I am
prepared to lay aside all business duties and
to give my entire time and attention to the
civic affairs of San Francisco. (Applause.)
In the old country It is customary for the
government to a.-k of the young men who. grow
up two or three years of tnetr service imd
it is compulsory that they perform It, but
here in free America no such law exists, but
that does not prohibit a man who la toiling
along and making his way In the world, happy
and contented in his present situation, and
who is willing, dropping the cares of business
for a few years and devoting; some 1 of hit
time and attention to the community of which
he Is proud to be a member. (Applause.)
Ban Francisco has framed a charter and we
have heard a great deal about that charter.
We have been toid how that charter has got
to be eavod. but there is one thing that we
have not been told and I wish to impress this
upon the minds of the voters of Ban Fran
cisco, that for the first time In the history of
that charter it is going to be administered
by the Republican party.' (Great arplause.)
The Democratic party has spent two terms
upon it and the Labor party on< term.- and
both adm't that It Is a formidable document
in the hands of any one but themselves. I
tmr.lr. to use a slang expression, we will give
them "a touch of high life" as to how the
charter is to be administered. (Laughter and
great applause.)
In regard to the bond Issue â you have heard
nr.d read a great deal about It. but' you have
thoucht more. You are the people who voted
for them and you are not going to take those
bonds and pux them Into a bankrupt concern.
You are splng to put them in a pa-ty's hands
whom you have known a lifetime: you are
going to put them In the hands af those who
can pay you the best interest; you are going
to turn them over to a party who will ad
mlnleier to the good of the c!ty In a business
like manner. (ADDlaune.) â¢
I don't want to appear egotistical If I men
tion myself for a few minutes. You have
chosen me from the ranks of the people
Mayers are Instances. They have existed be
fore and they will exist after this term, but
the people of San Francisco are going to give
more care and~attentlon to that office than
ever before in the history of the city. They
are going to do It because m national affalra
we look for appropriations from the Govern
ment: in municipal affairs we must look for
our own Improvements. Therefore, without re.
rard to party "if filiations, every voter Is going
to the polls and he Is going to vote as he
thinks.
WILL DEMAND CAPABILITY.
If I am elected Mayor of San Francisco I
will rive you es perfect an administration aa
it is poetlble for any one man to eive. (Ap
plause.) On behalf of my party, on behalf
of the candidates of that party, I ask your
suffrage. I ask you to indorse the nominations
of the Republican party and I will ack you
to indorse those who are not here to speak
for themselves. I have a particular friend,
vhOM voice has left him. He has been cam
paigning too hard. Percy V. Long. (Ap
plause.) I wish to say that Mr. Jxmg will
be an able man to take the City Attorney'*
office. I wish to eay In behalf of Judge Bahrs
that he is one of the strongest nominees on
the ticket (Applause.) Judge Bann has lost
his voice, but he has a son " here who will
speak for him. Â¦ I wish to" lay for "Henry J.'
Crocker, If* you choose, that I will , not try to
run the city officers that have been elected
by the people. They "each have. their duties;
they each have gone before the : people ; each
will have fata duties to perform and I believe
that with the co-operation of . the Mayor and
assisted by their proper officers they will 'give
you a perfect and harmonious administration.
I want to : say In regard to the particular
office of Mayor that no man In my estimation.
WITH waving flags and echoing i
shouts Kcnry J. Crocker, the
Republican standard-bearer, -was
enthusiastically greeted In
Franklin Hall last night by the
voUTB cf the Fortieth Assembly District.
The meeting was by far the most repre
s-native and effective one yet held In any
of iht districts during the present cam
paign. The meeting by the Union Labor
party a week ago was a frost compared
to last night's outpouring. Thero was
genuine enthusiasm displayed and every
;hing points to a rousing majority in this
district on the day of election.
Despite the fact that a physical culture
professor was putting his class through i
Delsarte movements and the meeting: was !
not called to order until 9 o'clock, the j
crowd waited patiently and forgot fatigue
when craters let flow their eloquence.
Mr. Crocker did not arrive at the hall
until late in the evening. He was
escorted to the platform by Jesse Marks,
a Republican who at the primaries fought
the delegates who nominated the well- j
knpwn business man as the leader of the |
Republican party !n the coming municipal
election. The Republican nominee was j
Immediately recognized and hundreds j
sprang *up to get a good look at the can- i
didate and cheor him. The hall resounded" ;
with cheers and the volume of sound I
Feenud to increase as the nominee for j
Mayor got closer to the platform. The '
climax was reached, however, when Mr. i
CroeUer appeared on the stage and bowed j
his acknowledgments to the applauding ,
hundreds who crowded the place. Louis j
N. Jacobs, the candidate for Recorder, j
attempted to continue his speech, but he i
.was constantly Interrupted by some en- j
thusiast calling for "Three cheers for I
Henry J. Crocker." .
Edpar D. Pelxotto called the meeting j
to order and In the course of his wel- j
coming address expressed himself as be- j
ing gTeatly pleased at the large\ attend- i
ance. la part he said:
The voter* cf . the Fortieth District cay
remember that in the primary election held j
net !on_ aÂ«ro one of the tickets n-.is defeated ;
in a friendly contest. The eontert Is over i
and I am glad to say that the Fortieth District j
FJajidjt to-nlrtit united for the Republican
ticket, from Henry J. Crocker flown to the feet j
man en it. lApplause.)
There are no bolters In the Fortieth Dis
trict. (Applause.) It is one of the banner
Republican district.* in this city, and Judging
by the excellence of the Republican ticket
placed In the field this campaign we are as
sured from every source that it wll! be elected
*'}â¢ one of the largest majorities ever had in
this city. (Applause.)
Th!s meeting phcxrg that there 's that ap
preciation for the ticket. Ladles end gentle-
DUs, it Is not my province to emlcavor to
tnt^rtaln you with any remarks. We have a
number of candidate? here and a number of !
-"leakers, who will endeavor to entertain and !
instruct you upon the issues of this campaign
Â¦ad rive you reason* why we expect you to
-i:ppnrt the ticket. I take great pleasure in
Introducing Dr. C. V. Cross, who will act as
Â¦hairman of this me-etinz. _____
CHAIRMAN SPEAKS.
I>r. Cross expressed himself as being
hishlv, honored in presiding over such a
pple&dJd meeting. He 6aJd such an out- I
pouring of voters augured well for tho [
success cf th<" ticket. He took ; great j
pleasure introducing Senator Edward I. j
Wolf* 1 , who delivered a good campaign j
speech. Mr. Wolfe proved to be a forcible
rpeaker and held his audience to the end.
In :>art he said:
1 congratulate the Republicans of the For- I
ttrth AfjinWy District upon the magnificent i
at--5=cmblape of ladies and gentlemen that I Â«Â¦Â« j

(Great enthu*iaym.>
I at-k you. latfie* and gentlemen, is there any
r<arrn In this cam;>*;xn why eay Republican
rhould refrain from voting his riarty ticket?
Go buck two or three yÂ«ara ago and what did
,Â«f find in the Republican party? We found
t^e party b.-j?s-ridden. We fcund the politics
controlled in n back room by \t>e or two m.en. !
We found thf- convention dominated by Influ
rncr-t that did net ter.d to the good of this
municipality, and this condition continued along
until the better element in the party " deter
mined that thine? must chance. Out of that
fir-tenr.inatiop came the United Republican
I^npuf. (Applauw.) Men worked unselfishly
f<ir the pood of the party. A ticket was put up
!n the primary composed of R.eoublic*n men !n
the various districts ard more than 13.000 votes
v.rrr- nc!!M for the ticket. The United Repub
lican I>-ajru*"e ticfeat was triumphant; the con
mtvOtm was on panlrÂ»d bee from corporation
tnfiernre. free from bor? rule, and it nominated
a defect from top to bottom that should chal-
Vnp*- t)w admiraUon of every citizen In San
Francises. * â¢ â¢ Â¦ '! '
rf Mr. <"Yock'T is elected Mayor he will give

A TRUSTED MAN.
We can safÂ«'.v trust the administration of the

â¢ ip^ -to-night Indicates anything, and It is one
of the Â«me kind of mertings that are being
held all over San Francisco the Republican
'ticket will be elected by a large majority vote.
(Applause.)
Maxwell McNutt. a ris'njf young lawyer
of San Francisco, who is n candidate for
Supervisor, was next introduced and was
tjiven a fine reception by the assembled
voters. He had many friends in the hall
: and they shouted that they were In his
â¢ fight and would help him achieve a vic

It U unnecessary for me to â ttempt a dls

Captain Armstrong; who is to succeed Rln

at this port and is as well known and highly
considered In all the ports of the Orient. He
T.-as here for many yearÂ« as chief officer of
the Belglc, in which vessel he> returned to
England. He i& at present In command of
the Persic, one of the White Star Line's Aus
tralian liners. Armstrong wan probably one
cf the most universally liked officers that ever
Bailed out of this port and when I he left tlu
mantle of his popularity fell upon the broad
ehoulder* of his shipmate. Harry Gaukroger.
row chief officer of the Doric. Armstrong and
Gaukrogrr are both peculiarly gifted in the art
of making friends for themselves and for tho
company In whose service they are risinj. ar.d
in a popularity contest their names would
rtand side by. side at the head of the li-t.
Nobody Is more pleased than Captain Rlnder
at the selection of his successor. "There in
nobody." he said yesterday. "to whom I
would sooner surrender my command than to
Armstrong." Th*Â« Mongolia will be here about
the end of the year.
Captain John H. Rlnder. commander of the
steamship Coptic, has resigned from the serv
ice of the White Star Line to accept the com
mand of the Pacific Mall Company's new liner
rfcr-KcIia. Chief Officer Bcudnell will com
mand the Coptic for the next voyage, but upon
her return to this port Captain F. H. Arm
strong, who has been appointed to relieve Rin

known here. His first vlelt was In 1875, when
he came as an apprentice on the British ship
Golden Gate. He was here later as captain
of tfce lark Childwell. He cntpred the service
of thr White Star Line In 1860 and has for
thirteen years been on the steamships char
tered to the Occidental and Oriental Steamship
Conir&ny running between this port and the
Orient. Eight of thoee thirteen years Rlnder
has Iven in command. His appointment to
the Mongolia came as a surprise In the little
world .interested, in , BUch matters and may
cause rome heartburning among those Pacific
Mall officers whose ambition caused them to
count themselves In line for one of the new

The Automobile Club of California now
has 125 members, but hopes to double or
treble that number. It was suggested
that the directors lease a suitable build
ing in the environs of San Francisco to
Y>r used as a clubhouse, where members
rr:ay rest, refresh themselves and get
their automobiles attended to. â¢ Some of
thp members are strongly of the opinion
ihat some inducement of this kind is nec
essary to get new members into the club.
It is Dropoiifcd that the clubhouse phall

the Automobile Club and their guests. It
is= believed that a clubhouse would induce
many owners of automobiles who reside
in Alumeda, Oakland. Berkeley and other
towns to become members of the Automo
bile Club of California.
If any profit results from the meet to
be held under the management of the Au

Mrs. Marchand Owns Land.
Judge Seawell decided yesterday that
Evelyn Marchand. wife of Eduard March
and of restaurant fame, is the owner of
a block of land between the park and the
ocean beach. Her title was disputed by
her husband, who claimed that when he
deeded the property to her he did so
with the understanding that the prop
erty was to remain his until his death.
The testimony showed, however, that he
had given the property to her outright.
He did not question her title until after
she sued him for support.

No useful purposes, therefore, would be sub
served by such determination. An afflmative
opinion could not bs followed by a vindication
of the law;*a negative one might be regarded
as an affirmance of the validity and propriety
of methods dealing with the Government in
cases where, after all, the form of the trans
act len is not to be so much considered as its
substance.
: By "any further action." you mean, I pre
sume, criminal action. There is no occasion,
however, j for me to determine whether the
transaction called in question, and which, you
say is the only one v.-herein there is any evi
dence of violation of law, presents suf Hcient
guarantee for a criminal prosecution under sec
tion 3700. Revised Statutes, since the statutory
period of limitation within which such a prose
cution could be brought elapsed more than a
year ago.
The Attorney General, after discussing
the case in all its phases, says he is of
the opinion that "no part of the consider
ation paid by the Government is subject
to a demand for repayment."
Secretary Root asked the Department
of Justice whether any. further action Is
called for on the part of the Government
and upon the point the Attorney General
says:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22.â The text of
the' opinion of Attorney General Knox in
the Littauer case was made'public at the
War Department to-day. A considerable
portion of the opinion Is devoted to the
Question asked Secretary Root as to
whether suit should be entered against
Littauer for money paid for the glovea
furnished, the point hinging upon the con
struction of the word "advanced" in the
section of the Revised Statutes which au
thorized suit "for the recovery of any
such sum of money so advanced."
The death of Father Nugent comes as a
great loss to the parishioners, for he was
dearly beloved by these who had known
and appreciated his good work.
Father Nugent leaves a brother and a
sisterâ Father John F. Nugent and Mag
gie Nugent.
Funeral services will be held In St.
Rose's Church Saturday morning at 10
o'clock, after which the body will be laid

Michael King of St. Mary's Church. Oak
land; Father Hugh Lagan of Sacred Heart
Church and Father T. Caraher of St.
Francis Church. Father McAuIiffe and
Father Collopy will be the sub-deacons.
Father Nugent had suffered from gen
eral debility for some time and for the
laat six weeks had been confined to his
house. His work, however, was continued
up to a few moments before his death,
as he was conscious to the last.
The body pf the dead priest will lie in
state in St. Rose's Church until Satur
day morning, when high mass will be
celebrated by Bishop Montgomery, who
will be assisted by Archbishop Riordan.
On hi3 arrival in this State Father Nu
gent was appointed Vicar General of the
diocese of Marysville, which office he held
until he was made pastor of the parish
of San Leandro several years later.
Subsequently Father Nugent was trans
ferred to St. Mary's Church of this city,
â¢where h4 served with the late Archbishop
Alemany up to the year 1873, when he was
appointed pastor of St. Rose's Church on
Brannan street. , . -Â¦-,
The late Father Nugent waa born in
Newtown, County Hamilton. Ireland, in
1839 and at the age of 23 was ordained
at Chicago, but shortly afterward he
came to California. . â¢
Father Dennis Nugent died yesterday
morning in the parish house of St. Rose"s
Church on Brannan street.

"Shipments of Hay show a marked falling
off for the past, week, the total with to-day'a
arrivals being 2400 tons, a decrease from, the
week preceding of 800 tons. There is some
little complaint about the. scarcity of cars, oth
erwise shipments might have been a trlno>
heavier. Trade is not overbrlsk, however, and
It seems to be the determination of all holders
of Hay to realize pome profit on their country
fetor Its. A lull Is always to be expected this
time of the year, for mo5t consumers have been
busy stocking up their barns during the sum
mer and early fall. A fairly good export trade
can be noted, however, and a continuous move,
ment of Hay toward Interior points is re
ported. It is yet too early to speculate about
the weather, but the way the rain Is holding
off is exciting some speculation as to what the
season will be. - â¢
"On our market here nothing of interest can
be reported, the retail trade taking Its usual
quota, which demand is mostly for choice
wheat Hay. Straw Is In rather light supply
and is selling fairly well. Alfalfa Is a trifle
easy, owing to more plentiful shipments. In
some districts the fifth crop Is now being har
vested and in due time will be marketed If
the weather remains clear. The cheaper grade
of Hay, what Is termed stable Hay, is a trifle
easier in price, although very few concessions
have been made In figures to effect^ sales.
Therefore, although the market Is a bit quiet,
we can report no change from the quotations
of last week."

CHICAGO. Oct. 22. â General selling In De
cember wheat was the chief feature of trading
In that pit to-day and lower prices were record
ed. Opening Dricea were barely fÂ«teady on
favorable weather for the movement of grain
and on ea.Â«ler cables. December belnt: %c
lower to %c higher at SOgsOHc. The heavy
selllcs of yesterday was also a bear factor
early In the day as also was the easier tone
in all outside markets. Elevator interests and
longs sold freely the first hour and with
Ecarcely any demand December slumped off to
79%c. A report from Minneapolis to the effect
that there was little demand' for cash wheat
from millers was a factor In depressing prices.
The market was quiet and prices steady the
latter part of the day and December closed
at 79Vi<570%c. The May. delivery was firm
throughout the entire session on a good com
mission-house demand.,. '
A better demand for corn existed than for
some time past and the market ruled firm.
Closing prices were steady, with December %c
higher at 44c after telling between 43%c and
44ViÂ®Â«vic.
Firmness characterized the trading In oats,
due largely to the better tone In corn. After
ranging- between 3."Â» 1 4@35 : };<rK?5 1 %e December
closed %c higher at 35% c.
Provisions were extremely quiet, but a
trifle firmer feeling prevailed. Influenced by an
ad\-ance of 10c In the prices of hogs. Tht
only feature was a fair demand fcr lard by
brokers. Pork closed 60 higher lard was up
2U,c. and ribs were 10c higher.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

Though trading was still light on the Stosk
and Bond Exchange, there was more fluctua
tion on the afternoon session than for some
little time. The gas stocks were strong. Gas
and Electric advancing to $67. the Trustees'
Certificates to $66 75. and Mutual Electric to
$11 25. Contra Costa Water was higher at
$4CÂ®42 50. though the transactions were small'.
California Wine declined from $93 60 to $92 50

The local demand for most description* of
fresh fruits was -slack and there was very
little inquiry for -shipping. .Apples and Grapes,
which formed the bulk of the * receipts, were
easy, and there were large lines unsold at the
close of business. Some dealers were still ask
ing $1 25 per box for some varieties of fancy
Apples, but sales at that figure were rare. In
fact. $1 was considered, an extreme price for
this general run of fancy stock. Wine Grapes
continued dull and depressed, with only strict
ly fancy stock bringing the quotations. Soft
and leaking stock was freely offered at prices
ranging from $12 to $13 per ton, but found few
takers. Receipts of Flga were very light and

GARDEN CITY, L., I., Oct. 22.â With
foui> men left in after the qualifying and
first rounds of play ln the Individual
championship contest of the Intercollegi
ate Golf Association, Harvard seems to
have a good" chance of winning double hon
ors again this year. Harvard sent seven
of her strongest players to j battle for
honors In the individual championship,
which began to-day with a qualifying
round of eighteen holes, and all of them
qualified. In the first round of â¢ match
play three of them met with defeat, but
the strongest men, H. C. Egan, W. E.
Egan, W. B; McBirney and "W. C. Chick,
survived. .
H. Chandler Egan, who won the indl
vldual championship last year, again is
well to the fore. After winners play win
ners, Egan will meet McBirney in* the
first semi-final match to-morrow, but this
fact will not weaken Harvard's chances
to any extent.
In the afternoon Miss Rhona Adalr,
champion woman golfer of Great Britain,
with Devereaux Emmett as a partner,
played against Walter J. Travis, the am
ateur champion golfer of America, who
played against the best ball of the Pacific.
Miss Francis C. Griscom of Philadelphia
was to have j been Travis' I partner in a
mixed foursome, but she withdrew at the
last moment and the other match was
speedily arranged.
Travis won the match by one tip. The

William S. Devery, who had originally
procured a bondsman for Parks to the
amount of $18,000. has declined to aid him
any longer. In a long statement, issued
to-night, Devery gave his reason, say
ing: Â¦ â¢ ': â¢â - Â¦ Â¦ .
I had already Drocured bondsmen for Mr.
Parks in the sum of $18,000. This wag. done
merely as a matter of .friendship to . htm and
because I believed he was a persecuted man.
I have not Â«ee.n Parks since October 7, when
he returned from Kansas City.. Since that
time he has been consorting with Mr. Murphy
and his friends and <hey have been undertak
ing his defence, so I am Informed. I, will not
etand for any man who carries water on both
shoulders and who in not as straight in his
friendship to me as I am to him. Parks has
acted the part of an lngrate to me. v; y.V
NEW YORK, Oct. 22.â Samuel J. Parks,
the convicted walking delegate, slept in
the Tombs to-night, with prospects of
staying there several days. Confident
that John J. Byrne, his bondsmen for
118,000, would supply $5000 additional for
his appearance to answer to a charge of
perjury, he walked . into .the Criminal
Courts building and was at once placed
under arrest. He was a disconsolate fig
ure when # after waiting for hours for
Byrne to "come to him with one of the
many messengers he had sent scurrying
after him, he was taken across the bridge
of sighs and into the Tombs.
"Why do they not take me out at sun
rise and shoot me?" he asked. "I might
as well go to the Tombs,- and I suppose
I will stay there until they are ready to
send me away."
He. did not know that Byrne had been
in the building while he, was there. Byrne
is now practically relieved of obligation
under his bonds, as Parks is in custody.
It was this phase of the situation that
compelled Parks to go to prison,, for he
readily. could have given bonds on the
perjury charge and had $2000 In bills to
offer. When his lawyer arrived Parks
was taken before Judge Foster, where
he pleaded not guilty to the charge of
perjury, with permission to withdraw this
plea or make any motion before next
Thursday. Bail was fixed at $5000. Parks
was informed that his former bonds of
$18,000 must be renewed before he would
be released.

IN THE TOMBS
Compatriot Pugsley, vice-president of
the New York Society of the Sons of the
American Revolution, who is here with
the Bankers' Association, delivered greet
ngs from his ' compatriots in New York
to their brothers of California.
Compatriot "Warren Olney, Mayor of
Oakland, responded to the toast, "Was
the Loss of Her American Colonies a
Blessing or a Detriment to Great Britain?"
Mayor Olney in eloquent terms paid to
the mother country every tribute of re
spect and treated the subject of the toast
impartially. ' He considered that the loss
of her American colonies had been a
beneficial lesson to Great Britain, as was
evidenced in the treatment of Canada and
Australia. He reminded his hearers that
they were "the bone of her bone and flesh
of her flesh," and while criticizing Great
Britain's policy of the past declared that
he and all Americans would stand shoul
der to shoulder with her should It ever
transpire that she was in need of support.
The â¢ declaration was received with
cheer and hurrahs. .
Battle with its clashing saber and goer
record was vividly fought over again last
night at the Merchants' Club when the
valiant deeds .of the men who laid down
tfieir lives in the American Revolution
were recounted by a goodly assembly of
the California Society of the Sons of tha
American 'Revolution. The occasion 'was
the celebration of the one hundred and
twentieth anniversary of the proclama
tion disbanding the Continental army.
It was a peaceful, law-loving set of
men that graced the festive board around
which tales of the deeds of their brave
ancestors made the heart bound with pa
triotic pride.
After a sumptuous menu had been dis
cussed there were speeches from states
men and soldiers, preceded by an Invoca
tion by the Bishop of California, the
Right Rev. W. F. Nichols, D. D.. A wel
come address to compatriots, and guests
was then delivered by Giles H. Gray,
president of the society. The response
to the toast, "The , Disbandment ,of the
Continental Army, 1783," was given into
the hands of Compatriot George C. Par
dee, Governor of California-
Governor Pardee responded in a man
ner that aroused his hearers to the height
of enthusiasm. Â«He said that he con
sidered the disbandment of the army in
17S3 one of the greatest achievements that
had ever happened, i ' Â¦
GO VEBNOB'S VIVID PIOTUJfctE.
The army was reduced to a mere BOO
in number, at a time when the country,
was' torn and dismembered by" bloody
war; trade had gone, commerce had gone
and a debt of $8,000,000 was on the United
States and $30,000,000 on the States them
selves. The Governor drew a vivid pic
ture of the condition of the period. There
was no trade, there were no industries;
indeed, he - said, there was nothing to
which that disbanded army could return,
yet when discharged they were absorbed
into | the body politic and left behind no
sign of the military life that they them
selves had led. The Governor traced from
that time on to the present, when pros
perity â¢ and every blessing abounded for
every man and woman and child *of the
land. He told of the" great institutions
that had arisen, molded and been brought
to a state of perfection by the patriotic
men of the nation.
At the close of his remarks the Gov
ernor was lustily cheered again and
again.
Major General Mac Arthur, U. S. A., who
ably responded to the toast, "The Dis
bandment of Other United States Armies',"
was given a hearty greeting both before
and at the conclusion of his remarks.

One local banker remembered that there
was an offer by one New York concern
some time ago to pay within 1 per cent
of the ruling rate on the New York Stock
Exchange for money. As the rate ran up
to 30 per cent there was no surprise when
the company failed.
One of the best informed bankers of
San Francisco is authority for the state
ment that there is probably less San
'^Francisco money now in New York than
there has been for some time. . The large
amount cf ready money needed for ex
pensive bulldine in San Francisco dur
ing the year 1903 was assigned as one
reason for this condition. Another was
that there hav e been large investments
In enterprises in this city and In the State
at large during the last few months. The
names of moneyed men like those of the
Goulds. Goelet and J. Pierpont Morgan
are connected with the trust companies
in New York that have sent out circular
letters soliciting accounts from San Fran
cisco.
Some of the largest trust companies in
Gotham are sending circulars to this city.
If they have received a favorable re
sponse from San Francisco that fact is
not acknowledged here. Bankers with
Eastern connections said yesterday that
there would be no application to them
in San Francisco. If money was worth
4 per cent in New York unquestionably
their New York representatives would
know the fact and would do as they
thought best. The savings banks did not
think that there was any chance that they
would be approached.
Discrimination has been exercised by
the New York trust companieÂ» In mak
ing applications for San Francisco ac
counts. President William Alvord and
Vice Prpsldent Anderson of the Bank of
California said yesterday that they had
not received any letters on the sub
ject. In come quarters it -was said
that 4. per cent was not an unusual price
for the New York trust companies to
offer, as the reports of the New York
State Bank Commission show that returns
have been made of transactions at 4 per
cent.
Various New York trust companies
have recently eent letters to commercial
and national banks in San Francisco,
making offers to pay 3V& per cent on
daily balances to secure new accounts.
The savings banks have not received any
communications of this sort, so far as
can be learned. All banks having connec
tions in New York are also exempt
from this sort of solicitation. There was
a rumor on the 6treet yesterday that one
letter had been received in which the rate
of 4 per cent was offered for new ac
counts.

smokes eight or tÂ«n cigars a day, alleges
J-ess, and has taught their three children

children are now in charitable institutions,
having been placed there by him, after his

rr.ee he drove- her out of their home with
A shotgun. He also threw a large knife
at her, she says, and aEsaulted her with
a hatchet. It is also alleced by Mrs.
Fcott that her husband frequently re
irained out all night, coming home in the

Shepherd stated that he would not pro
duce the books of the company showing
receipts and expenditures, as it would
give information to competitors who
would bid for. the regular franchise.
Braunhart thought a temporary permit
should be granted until June 30, 1904. Su
pervisor Loughery said it would be un
just to compel the company to. give fig
ures as to its financial condition, as it
proposed to bid for a new franchise. . At
Troy's suggestion -the company will be
required to abandon any rights It may
have after November 6 and to keep the
streets on which the road runs in good
repair. The City Attorney's advice will
be asked \ before any final agreement is
made. Formal action on the permit was
postponed until next Thursday.
The California Outdoor League re
quested- that all provisions for an over
head trolley system be eliminated from
any franchise that may be granted for a
street railroad on Geary street or any
other thoroughfare.
Braunhart characterized a suggestion of
Troy that the city run . automobiles on
Geary street as ridiculous and the latter
accused the Supervisor of "doing' up" the
Geary-street road : proposition. , Braun
hart retorted that any one who accused
him . of any sinister purpose in his ad
vocacy of public ownership told a de
liberate falsehood.
Then Troy spoke as follows:
"The Geary Street Company is not en
titled to any favors from this board, be
cause it made threats at one time that
It would prevent the acquisition of the
Geary-street road. I ask. that Mr. Platt
bring the books of the company, for I be
lieve I can. prove that the reason why
the proposition did not .receive a two
thirds vote was because of corruption.
The company has paid at least $1,500,000
in dividends." . ' Â¦
NOT ENTITLED TO FAVORS.
"In the absence of the necessary funds
to run the road," said Braunhart. "we
must find other means to operate it for
the accommodation of the public, and you
will please refrain from criticizing the
committee. I see no legal way for the
city to operate the road."
"It seems a great hardship to close this
road down," said Shepherd, "and all we
ask is a temporary permit until a new
franchise is srranted."
The suggestion of the Richmond Im
provement Club that the city' rent the
Geary T street road or run a system of
buses to accommodate the public was
deemed not feasible as there are no funds
available for such a purpose. E. P. E.
Troy thought some $240,000 collected under
special levy for schools and hospital could
be used, but the committee held that the
money could not be utilized.
"Judging from your attitude here," said
Troy, addressing the committee, "you
seem to be inclined to do an illegal act
by giving the company a temporary fran
chise."
PLAN NOT FEASIBLE.
"There are legal obstacles in the way of
granting . a temporary franchise," said
Braunhart. "A taxpayer might protest
against the grant and I do not see how
the charter could be complied with In a
temporary franchise. There is no dif
ference of opinion regarding the public
convenience resulting from the operation
of the road."
"We are," replied Shepherd, "and will
.conform to the requirements' of the char
ter, which call for the payment of a per
centage of the gross receipts to the city.
We think thai, an affirmative vote of the
Board of Supervisors is all that will be
required."
','Are you ready to pay a percentage of
the gross receipts?" asked Supervisor
d'Ancona.
A. D. Shephejd, representing Horace G.
Platt. president of the roal, who is ill,
addressed the committee and pleaded for
permission to run the cars on Geary street
until; such time as a new franchise is
granted. . . .
The Supervisors' Public Utilities Com
mittee decided yesterday In . favor of
granting the application of the Geary
Street Railway Company for a temporary
permit to operate the road from. Novem
ber 7, 1903, the date of the expiration of
the , present f ranchtee, until a new fran
chise is granted. The company was re
quested to file a communication stating
what it would agree to pay for the per
mit. The committee took action with the
condition that the permit is revocable at
the pleasure of the board and that the
company file a stipulation that the tem
porary permit is in no sense to be con
sidered a franchise.
Mr. Van Ness in his argument related
the history of the case. James Mervyn
Donahue, at the time of his death the
husband of Belle 'Wallace, now Mrs.
Sprague, bequeathed to various charities
$165,000, exclusive" of $25,000 for the erec
tion of a monument and fountain to the
memory of his father, Peter Donahue.
After all the debts of the estate- were
paid there remained $600,000, out of which
the $165,000 bequests were to be paid. If It
were to be decided that the fountain be
quest was a charity the sum would be in
creased to $190,000, which would be more
than one-third of his separate estate.. Of
this sum $100,000 was bequeathed to Ro
man Catholic orphan homes. He had be
queathed also another $100,000 to buy land
and erect a building for poor old men and
women, but this was stricken out, be
cause the law does not permit more than
one-third of a testator's estate- to be de
vised for charitable purposes.
Mr. Van Ness spent the greater part of
his time in commenting upon the commu
nity and the fountain- agreements execut
ed between the parties to the suit, and ar
gued that if the contention of the defenso
be true that Ryland T. Wallace did not
hold a power of attorney from his sister
to execute" that agreement it waa very
strange, to say the least, that an able
lawyer and business man, such as he was,
should have signed his sister's name to
the agreement by himself as her attor
ney.
Peter Dunne will reply for the defense
this morning at 10 o'clock.
DISCUSSES AGREEMENTS.
In reply to a question by Peter Dunne,
of defendants' counsel, Mr. McEnerney
admitted that during his argument before
Judge Angellottl he had not produced the
fountain agreement. He said, further,
that am appeal had been taken, not by
Archbishop Riordan, but by Peter J. Mc-
Glynn and J. F. Burgln, executors of the
will, to recover for the executors of the
will $5000' extra compensation which had
been denied them by Judge Angellottl,
who had allowed them only $2000 on a
claim for $7000. They had argued that the
fountain was not a charity and the wit
ness had argued that it was. Ryland T.
Wallace had told the witness that his sis
ter "stood to- lose" $8333 and that he would
advise his sister to pay that sum. Mr.
Wallace had also told the witness, "All
that my sister and her daughter lose is
$16,666 66."
Mr. McEnerney explained that on A'ug
ust 1, 1896. Judge Angelottl decided not
only that the fountain was a charity, but
a preferred charity, and "that it came out
100 cents on the dollar ahead of all other
legacies." So far as the witness was con
cerned, he had said to Ryland T. Wallace
that he would not take an appeal because
it was a matter of no importance to his
fide under the contract.
I told Mr. Wallace that so far as we were
concerned It was a matter of no moment
whatever what the* Judge would do in respect
to that property, because his sister. Mra. Belle
Donahue, was obligated to make good the dif
ference. We had the contract with Mrs. Don
ahue holding us harmless. We could have
taken an aopeal and could have claimed that
as a charity it could be scaled down, in which
event the $25,000 would no lonircr be a lien
upon the charity fund. For tf we could es
tablish on appeal that Mr. Wallace's argu
ment before Judge Angellottl was a Rood argu
ment we could have got $25,000 out of the
charitable legacy and would have put our
selves in the t>ame position that the contract
now places us. I should not have argued
that It was a charity If we had not had this
agreement. If it was not a charity It would
be charged against the whole estate, one-third
against Mr. Donahue, one-third against Isabel
Donahue and one-third against the remainder.
Mr. McEnerney continued:
Mr. McEnerney's testimony took up the
greater parjt of the forenoon. He said
that Ryland T. "Wallace never claimed at
any time that there was. a want of con
sideration for the fountain agreement or
that that agreement was without consid
eration, or that he had been without
power to execute the agreement. The
witness had never heard any one else say
so; he had relied implicitly upon the va
lidity of the fountain agreement.. On June
16, 1896. in Superior Judge Angellotti's
court Ryland T. Wallace argued that the
legacy of $25,000 for the Donahue fountain
was a*charltable bequest and Mr. Hanlon
argued that it was in the nature of a fu
neral expenseâ a monument to the mem
ory of Peter Donahue, the father of
James Mervyn Donahue, and that it
should be ordered paid for out of the as
sets of the estate, just the same as if it
had been erected over his grave.
McENERNEY'S TESTIMONY.
Archbishop Riordan, Ryland T.' Wallace
and Garret McEnerney. occupied the
stand in the morning. The Archbishop
testified that he never gave George R. B.
Hayes, one of hie attorneys, authority to
draw up the fountain agreement exclu
sive of the community agreement, 1;he
latter agreement being the consideration
for the former.
At noon yesterday the taking of testi
mony In the suit of Archbishop Patrick
W. Riordan against Mrs. Belle Spragrue
and her husband, Richard Sprague, yraus
coucluded in the United States Circuit
Court. T. C. Van Ness made the opening
argument to the jury on behalf of the
plaintiff and occupied the time from 2 un
til 4 o'clock, at which hour an adjourn
ment was taken until 10 o'clock this
morning.
