About midnight,' "however,' a cry rang
over the vessel, and Ogilvie. swinging a
lantern and clad only In his night attire,
appeared upon the deck. One name was
on Ms lips, and he called for Lord Win-
His criminal weakness, his unmanly
lust for this cursed drug had gone far to
endanger the life of the vessel and every^
soul upon it: because, thouga neither re-'
eponsible for the storm nor the broken
screw ehaft. Captain Dgilvie had certain
ly been to blame for much else, and his
absence from duty was still a cause of
deep uneasiness to those who knew the
critical position of the ship and her dan
grerous situation with respect to the coast.
His knowledge and experience would
have been of the most vital service at
.this period; but he kept his cabin, with
k locked door, and 'appeared oblivious to
the welfare of his craft, and bis crew, bis
passengers and hteielf.
Meldrum had been neither sick nor
sorry from the first onset of the. storm,
but he was concerned enough for his
sweetheart; while she, though well In
body, found herself oppressed .beyond
measure with the fate of her uncle, and
knew full well the contempt'ln which he
waa now held by every honest man on the
Â«h5p.
TILE night crowded down, and sail
was shortened. Double watches
were aet despite the Weariness of
the men, and . Hook himself was
seldom far distant from the fo'c'ale
bead. Meantime the passengers, many of
whom had suffered no little fear and
misery, took heart once more.
General Podesta had steered his lady on
deck Just before dark to look at J.he
eeas, which, though trifling compared
with what they had been, were still run
ning high; Eignor Poltl had also come up
from his cabin to give one shuddering
glance at the waters and then retire be
low: and Tracy Fain, with whom the
heavy pitching had sadly disagreed, also
appeared on the lee side of the deck
saloon, and found himself the better for
a breath of air.

He fought like a maniac, with purpose
to hurl Lord Winston* overboard, and so
sudden and. tremendous was his onslaught
that but for the assistance of the first
engineer and Tracy. Fain, his lordship
might indeed have followed the hypo
dermic syringe and the glass tubes of
poison. The four struggled together; then
a blow, on the head dropped Ogilvie, and
at the same moment from forward came
a loud, thrilling cry of danger.
Hook's keen *~ eyes and ears Â¦ had > aaen
and heard what he now . announced in a
voice that rose like the roar ' of . a ; wild
beast across the night. Â¦**;- â¢ â¢ "â¢ '
With an awful , cry. like some, spirit
dropping into eternal torment,' the ; suf

Winstone bv the throat. , , > "â¢Â¦.-. "...
"Fetch it backâ you shall fetch it back
âby the angels. of. light, I swear It, or
I'll strangle you!" :
Lord Winstone faced " tha other un
flinchingly, but threw away his cigar 'and
made ready. J
"Your syringe is in the sea and all your
morphia, too," he said.
"You knowâ none better. Where is it,
I say? Quick, for the love of heavenâ
the syringe and my morphia. I'm In rag

possible. Only' be sure of thla". you will

"My morphiaâ my morphia, or I'll tear
the heart out. of you!"
"What is amiss?" asked Wlnstone, al
though he had divined the . truth after
a -first glance in the lantern light.* Â¦'.;'
The other spoke with passion in his
voice, but his articulation was vague and
his nerves evidently suffered from fright
ful tension. '.. , Â¦
Ogilvie had turned a sort of leaden gray,
and out of a face like that of a dead man
his eyes burned _ with living 'fire. His
cheeks had fallen in, his beard was un
shaven and he shook and tottered in his
walk. An appearance of greatly Increased
age had come upon him. His countenance
was deeply wrinkled .and an expression of
anxiety and terror, such as oftentimes
appears upon the. face of the dying,
marked his features. ' '. â¢ -^ â¢'>:Â»;-
In better health. But . the. other's face
told him that he hoped In Vain.
Â»teoÂ« with harsh persistence.
It happened that his .lordship had . not
turned In. but was himself on deck, walk
tng. up and down with . Tracy Fain "and
the- first engineer." ' .:
The sea was now much calmer, and the
chip being on an even keel, many who
had not slept for the last eight and forty
hours were . glad of the. opportunity to do
ao. The Morning Star: was for the most
part a home of sleeping, men. therefore,

â¢But what landâ what land can lie here?"
. Captain Ogilvie waa running forward,
and passed them as Winstone spoke. He

himself and this man not twenty minutes
"before.", Â¦ â¢' . ' â¢â¢Â¦. Â¦ Â¦-'' â¢ , ' : ','; :
Every body', was now up and awake; and
Captain Ogilvie. his fit of madness appa
rently, dispelled before' this countershock,
.'appeared upon the bridge, ghostly and
grim, like, some dark incarnation of the
storm. 'Â¦ .
\ "All over, bar : the last pinch, I'm
afraid,"' said Winstone to ' Meldrum, as
!the two " men stood staring at the death
''before them: * - _'Â¦' . '
Dan Hook yelled his terrible news,' and
the first officer called all hands to save
the ship, but human power was vain In
such a 'strait, and every experienced
man on ! board knew; that the Morning
Star had come to the end of her last voy
age.
â¢ Before they could bring her round, for
she answered but slowly and sulkily to
her helm under present circumstances,
the gray chaos of broken water had crept
close out of the night, and then deep cur
rents gripped the doomed hull with hands
of iron," and she wallowed, -broadside on,
100 yards from the breakers..
.The hoarse growl of the breakers and
the sudden- gleam of them not half- a
mile distant set the seal on his growing
alarm, yet staggered him Immeasurably.
There, right -away, to' the : east, on the
port bow, extended a hideous hell of
broken water wherehe had supposed only
the; deep sea rose and. fell, and, right
ahead, the- sea waa . also * splashed ; and
streaked with foam. ,
darkness, and what he had heard was
the tumble and roar of heavy seas beat-
Ing against j stone. , ' For some time ] his
anxiety had deepened, because there was
that in the Increased leap and wave beat
of the sea which told, him, despite the
darkness, that- the; Mornlnc. Star was in
shallower: water. And yet, as she had
been steadily-- standing to the southeast
he supposed that she should now be far
from shore.;
"'Delicate flush and glow of rose at length

Hearts took, hope as the time length
ened out and 'the sheets of white water

and seen It float on ahead clear of the

position he . bid them make Â¦ no effort - to

A sad vision of terror succeeded upon
this disaster. ' Two men were carried
overboard with .'. the foremast, and now
the great spar, held alongside by the
oordase, ;'. began to pound at the side ' of
the ship like a" battering ram. Astecn she
was settling, . as .: it ; seemed, . and " that
rapidly, but her bows rose well out of the

Here crowded the life of the ship. Mme.
Podesta, In the last agony of fear, clung
to her husband and rent the air with hys
terical shrieks: Signor Polti,' white to the
lips, knelt by, himself and bowed his head
and prayed; Dan Hook, roaring for aid,
was at work upon the broken mast, chop
ping and hacking at the heavy ropes
which bound; It alongside.
A strange white light from the wilder
ness of seething water, made darkness
visible, and against it might be seen the
huge form of Meldrum with the' lesser
shapes of Fain, Winstone and some of
the sailors struggling at a boat and en
deavoring to "turn 'her on the davits and
make ready for launching. Elizabeth
Ogilvle stood by her uncle, pale and
breathless, but silent.
Each moment of that terrible crisis
seemed; a century to all not actively en
gaged In manual labor. Those sweating
and struggling -with ax or rope suffered
least. The others stood mute and ready,
awaiting that last: plunge when the ship
would sink to her long home. .
But the Morning Star was hard and fast
and showed no "sign as yet of breaking
up. : She .would; not sink unless buffeted
from heriPresent position by the seas, and
this seemed an Improbable event, at any
rate for -the V present, as every moment
the waves decreased and the wind fell/
to the mainland of Mafia Island.
All too soon, however,' the end came.
Land,'; or, lofty rocks, had suddenly
loomed out of the night, and In the first
â¢ glimmering premonition of dawn, while
yet the stars shone diamond bright In a
clear sky, â the Morning Star touched
ground. So slight i proved the Bhock that
scarcely a Â¦ man was thrown off his feet;
but a sharper, , harsher Impact followed
and then the ship heeled over to star
board . and the foremast parted . twenty
feet i from the deck. . .

Captain Ogilvie presided at this confer

attend ' it. but declined to do so o- " the
ground that his, opinion upon such a ques
tion'could possess no value. Moreover,
he was entirely of one mind and frankly
admitted he could not approach \the ar

prejudice. , â¢ < '
At 3 in the afternoon Captain Ogilvla
and Mr.' Crouch appeared from the smok

that on the to-owing day all passengers
would â¢Â¦ be sent ashor* .' and effort* made
to save at least part of the freight. That

"You shall know. If we had absolutely

though the Morning Star had become a
total wreck, no danger to any aboard of
her could now be said to exist.
So the shipwrecked souls lifted up their

one and all, of the danger close at hand,

vie been aware of the exact positions of
the rocks on which she: now reposed-a.
Sad shin with a broken back-he could
hardly have navigated her into a safer
position from the point of view of the
human life aboard her.
She lay due north and south, was pro
tected on the west by Â«-. grinning" ridge
of rocks like, teeth, to the east by slmi
far but lower ridges. The channel she
had entered before striking shelved shore

from the ship, extended a bank of land-
of the passengers knew better, and Mr.
Messenger prayed on his knees In secret.
"Irough many hours that the unfortunate
Scotchman had passed the crisis of his
tribulation and might yet save his soul
and his body alive.
The night closed down without any in-,
terval of twilight, and flares were rigged
fore and aft to facilitate the nocturnal
work." Three boats were made ready, one
for the island, to be manned by Mr.
Crouch and a crew of four men; the
others, which were considerably larger
and carried big sails, for the passengers.
Of these" the second officer was to com
mand one, Dan Hook the other.
. Captain Ogilvie. Mr. Macabe and the
bulk of the crew would remain with the
ship and transfer cargo to the shore; and
as it was impossible to get steam for the
donkey engines to work the crane3, wind
lasses were rigged to bring up on deck
that portion of the freight which was
not alreadÂ£_under water. . -
There was no danger for those who
remained by the Morning Star, as in
the event of a return of bad weather the
men aboard could easily reach the shore
of the low islet on which they had been
cast. To this, indeed, a boat had already
put off, and after an examination the
crew of her reported an easy landing and
,the presence of some caves In the low
cliffs above high-water mark, where
/goods from the ship might . be safely
housed for the present.
Never in the memory of any on board
/had a big vessel been wrecked under
more fortunate conditions. As Hook
said;..
advanced, and when It, became a qua*
tlon of what each passenger should taJu
ashore, both Lord Wlnstone and Roy
Meldrum, after packing necessaries, de
clded for their batteries of guns, while
Tracy Fain, who was no sportsman, took
for his portion several * cases of beads
and knives, looking glasses and bright
trinkets, to be - used as gifts In their pro
gress across the countries of the various
savage potentates. No great anxiety ac
companied these decisions, as It was as
sumed that another visit would certainly
be paid the Morning Star before the ex
plorers finally set forth to the Interior.
The boat for, Mafia > Island had already
started before , the passengers came to
breakfast, and * as soon as possible after
that meal was finished Captain Ogllvla
bid Dan Hook pipe the crews of the two
whaleboats destined to convey his pas
sengers to the shore.
Soon both -floated alongside, and while
the passengers' luggage was being stored
and all necessary tackle shipped, the
skipper sent along a message to Lord
Wlnstone, desiring hl3 company. The
sportsman . Instantly complied and waa
soon hidden In the captain's cabin.
Alister Ogilvie looked a trifle stronger
than he had done for many days, and
though weak and thin, a very obvious
change for the better appeared In his
manner. His eyes were less wild, his ges
tures and speech more calm and dignified.
"Lord Wlnstone." he said, "before you

poisonous berries, and two others lay sick
from 4 the same cause, but were" expected
to recover. Other serious Illness there
was none. As for, food, it had been plenti
ful thus far, although the friendly na
tives, from whom Indian corn, fowls,
goats and bananas were purchased, knew
the value of beads and brass wire as well
as Lord Wlnstone himself.
For two 1 weeks all went well enough and
the little company settled down into a
military regularity and smartness. The
weather was fair; no danger threatened,
and the river in its lower reaches proved
tolerably easy. But the last few stages
were so- difficult and slow that, on a cer
tain day, near Furhanl, In tha Usagara
country," Lord Winstone decided that the
Mukondogwa' was no longer navigable,
and Meldrum called a halt for camp.
'Â¦' On the morrow the boats would return
whence they had came, and for purposes
of navigation the expedition would de
pend in future on chance canoes, either
occupied without permission or borrowed
by arrangement with friendly natives. One
hundred and twenty miles had been ac
complished in sixteen days on the river,
giving a fair average of more than seven
miles per day.
It was the 7th day of January when the
Meldrum treasure recovery company, as
Bessie called it, set forth by boat upon
the wide waters of the Waml. afterward
called the Mukondogwa Rrlver. The port
ers and fighting men were told their des
tination, but no more, and they regarded
the expedition as one to be devoted to
sport alone. Good progress was made at
tho outset and the last Indications of civ
ilization speedily vanished behind the ex
plorers as they pushed westward upon
their way.

"That's so. As for organization, you
hadn't thought of that; but j we must
have a sort of military system, for It's
the only thing a Zanzibari understands.
You're the commanding officer. I'm your
first lieutenant, and will go ahead with
my nigger hunter, Blackbird, and tha
little regiment of Soudanese righting men.
Then Fain, with the Arab, Omar Laluzl,
must lead one body of the Zanzibars, and
Dan Hook, with Raalt, the othe^r head
man, who's a rascal, If I'm not mistaken,
will head tho other."
"All right I'll tell Dan to watch the
chap pretty closely."
"Your grand difficulty with Zanzlbaris
Is to get common sense Into their asses'
skulls. At first they're the biggest fools
on earth, and quite obvious to danger
until it stares them in the face; and then
they turn into the biggest Â¦ cowards - on
earth, and will drop their guns' and fall
on their faces and let a naked savage
cut their throats single-handed, as though
they, were sheep.
"Now, good : night; and one more hint;
begin . with ; short marches i at first, no

On the eve of departure ' his ; Lordship
defined the position and the nature of the
expedition before them. : .
No mention of the treasure of precious
stones they, went to seek had been made
at Zanzibar. Indeed, Lord Wlnstone
frankly declared that the expedition must
be regarded as one of sport and adven
ture, for heads of heavy game and Afri
can curiosities were, in his opinion, the
only likely returns from the trip. He was
not, of course, aware .that Roy Meldrum's
finances had now become much diminish

Roy much desired Wlnstone to assume
the command, but bis Lordship declined
to do any < such thing. He pointed out
that Meldrum by all right must lead; that
he was a far more picturesque and com
manding figure than any in the â¢ column,

enced followers. He then made other
purchases, including three pack donkeys
and a riding ass; two tents, dipped in sul
phate of copper to preserve them from
rotting, a chest of various drugs and
three huge bottles of quinine. Cloth he
also purchased in large quantities, with
fifty pounds of brilliant beads and a mile
or so of bright brass wireâ an enormously
popular commodity with the savages.
Lastly he had the good fortune to meet
a former servantâ one Blackbird, a full
blooded Ethiopian, who had served him
faithfully on a former expedition. The
man was free and Joyfully Joined his old
master.
After dark the boat from Mafia Island
returned, and those aboard of her were
horrified at the terrible fate whi<h had
overtaken their companions. They them
selves brought the news that a little trad
ing schooner was leaving Mafia for Zanzi
bar two days later and. that she could ac
commodate half a dozen persons with
their luggage for that Journey.
Mr. Crouch, who was now in command,
declared his intention of returning to
Mafia Island in a few days, when those
at present in Ill-health had recovered ;
and after the wbaleboat returned: at
dawn to report tremendous surf off the
mainland and no possibility of making
shore in their craft, the first officer was
all the more, fixed In his "determination.
Early next day, therefore, the remain
ing passengers put off once more for the
island. ten miles distant, and with them
went . Dan Hook, whose wound . was ap
parently healing by first Intent. Â¦ He had
accepted Meldrum's offer to accompany
Then it transpired that neither Mr.
Rhodes, nor even President Kruger, were
the objects of their wrath. Polti's mis
sion was to destroy the Sultan of Zanzi
barâan example of the aimless and fat
uous policy usually adopted by anarchists
who, when they do pluck courage to
strike, usually destroy the le'ast powerful
or most amiable leaders cf men. .
Fain, who knew a little Italian, made
out that Polti had once been an assistant
in the laboratory in the scientific institu
tion of Bologna, had Joined the brother
hood, and had been drawn by lot to carry
out their policy in Africa. Others, whose
names were given, had similarly been se*
lected to destroy prominent personages
elsewhere, but against whom Poltl j de
signed to use the infernal machines of his
construction did not appear until several
leaders of his party were arrested and
made confession.

He brought out the heavy pocketbook
and the three men fell to carefully study

The incident of the anarchist Poltl Is.
"Never, Fred. She'll be our mascot.
God bless her!" declared the lover in a
fervor of conviction.
"It's no good arguing with you," an
swered his Lordship. "I only hope you
won't regret a foolish action when it is
too late."
"Perhaps she'll be the very one to find
them! A' woman's always got an eye for
gems."
"You're idiots, both of you. Such an
event as a young woman going on a big
game shooting expedition Into Central Af
rica dosn't often happen."
"BÂ«t it's going to happen."
"Yes, I know. You're taking your dia
mond with you, and I'm afraid she'll bad
ly handicap you in your search for the
other precious stones. That's tha truth
of the matter."
"Well. I hope things will be all right,
but I should feel a good deal happier If
she were not going," declared his Lord
ship. "It's a fool's trick, if you'll forgive
me for saying so."
"But she will come. What can a chap
do?"
JMeldrum refused
to avail himself
of it.
"I daren't, and
that's a fact," he
said. "You see the up
shot of this business is
very uncertain, and if I
don't find anything to pay
me at the other end. be
tween ourselves, Fred, I
shan't have even a home to
offer the girl when we come
back to civilization. Not, at any
rate, immediately. I've pot money
enough to see this business through,
and that's about all; so I'll put off
matrimony till I find where we are at
the end. It's only fair to Bessie."
At this moment Poltl, attired In a gray
suit and big gray hat of light felt, ap
ptared at th*Â« ten of the ladder.
"I ccrne this Instant." he said. "You
sadly fluster me, M. Meldrum, with your
hupe shoutings; and Capltalr.e Ogilvle, he
sadly fluster me also. One little portman
teau Is all else. I get him this instant.
Take this for me. Then I fetch my little
portmanteau quicker than lightning."
So saying be droped a small packet into
the boat and Meldrum caught it and put
It into his pocket until the owner should
arrive. Poltl again vanished to his cabin
and there began a further delay.
At this moment, thirty yards from the
ship's side, a big turtle appeared awlm-
"Ah! Now we see why this great In
dignation!" laughed Mme. Podesta, and
her little wrinkled face became as full of
lines and cross lines as a pipe rock melon.
"But as for Signor Poltl, though he Is a
man cf mystery, and was very, very
frightened when the great waves came,
he has a tongue of honey, M. Meldrum,
and the manner of an aristocrat. Far
more than the Lord Wlnetone. Is It not
so? '&r as dlabo a sua parte. We must
give sven monsieur the prince of the
gTeat warm place his due"
"Stupid Idiot." said Meldrum. "Why the
deuce should everybody be bothered like
this? And 'he other boat out there roast
ing, and Miss Ogilvleâ"
After being told the extent of the lug
gsge that he might take as his share,
Eignor Polti had disappeared to his cabin
and only once reappeared therefrom to
drink a cup of coffee at the hour of
breakfast- Now. they still waited for
him, and Roy shouted and Dan Hook
made irr.polite, asides.
In the other boat were to sail General
Podesta and his wife. Roy Meldrum and
Elgnor Poltl. The first officer, with four
men, had gene in the little vessel al
ready dispatched to Mafia, and Dan Hook
was therefore appointed Eklpper of the
second boat for the mainland.
The awful incident that followed could
only be dimly realized by those who be
held it. The first boat had pushed off,
proceeding cautiously clear of the rocks,
and was now waiting rather less that a
quarter cf a nolle distant for her com
panion.
Time passed end still the Eecor.d boat
did not come. An awning was rigged to
keep the terrible vertical sunshine from
Uessle'i head and Lord Winstone' grum
bled an echo to the growling comments
of the sailors, fcr the day grew each mo
ment more fiery hot. the wind was In
sufficient to fill th% boat's sail, and the
prospect of a thlrty-flve mile pull In a
heavy and deeply laden craft became less
and Ices pleasant to men alrcsdy weary
with a night of work.
"I'll give 'em five minutes more to fol
low," said the second officer, as he turned
In the stern sheets, and tried to get a
eight of the dawdling craft behind him.
"Now they're coming, I believe," he add
ed. "They're clear of the ship, anyway."
Meantime those in the second boat were
quite :-s irnpatien* of delay as their lead
ers and the more eo that one man only
was responsible for it.
"That I do, and I believe that though
your ship's a wreck, your soul will soon
be in derp water again. Forget the past
end look forward cheerfully to a Ufa of
health and honor and happiness â a life
worthy cf a man."
They shook hands heartily and Lord
Winstone bid his patient farewell.
"We shall meet to-morrow," he said.
"for I design to come back to the ship. If
all is well. There are several things I
canrot take with me now, but would wish
to have them before our expedition starts.
Indeed, if all Is well ashore and the of
ficers of the boats decide to come back to
the ship to-night. I shall probably re
turn with them, supposing they make no
objection."
So the interview ended and Lord Wln
6tone left the captain's cabin, little
dreaming that he had seen the last of Al
ister Ogilvle.
Soon the boats were loaded and man
red and a hearty cheer greeted the de
parture of the first under the command
of the second ofScer. With him he took
four men, while the passengers who ac
companied him were Miss Ogilvle, Tracy
Fain, Lord Winstone and Mr. Messenger.
Elizabeth had wished to stop with her
uncle, but she yielded to his desire and
the entreaty of PÂ»oy. It was proposed
that ehe should remain at Slmbaxanga
until everything possible had been saved
from the wreck, and then return with
Captain Ogllvie and his crew to Zanzibar,
from which port It would be possible to
get a vessel bound for Europe.
"Think no more of It, my dear fellow.
You would have done Just as much for

THE EXPEDITION IS FIT

Thus qutstloneu, Mel

cidents of thÂ« mornim;
in review, aaÂ«i uien
CHAPTER IX.
Happily, ample stores had already bÂ«en
taken off the ship to the island and now
a flre was lighted and a meal prepared.
Thus, out of a total of /orty-elght souls,
less than half were alive, and twenty-six
had perished. Of the former, one rescued
Bailor never recovered consciousness; Dan
Hook had received a heavy flesh wound
in his leg and the other men were suffer
ing In a less degree.
There was nothing to be done for the
rest, as most of those upon the ship had
been literally blown into their elements
by the explosion, and the few In the sec
ond boat not accounted for were either
drowned, destroyed by sharks, or slain
by the falling spars.
The survivors landed and a brief, hush
ed conference took place. Then the boat
was lightened and a small party, under
the second officer, set out for the main
land. Only sailors accompanied him and
It was hoped, as a lljjht breeze had now
sprung up, that they might make the
coast before dark and return on the fol
lowing day.
Captain Ogllvie, Mr. Macabe, his junior
officer In the engine room; General Po
desta, his' little wife, and Signor Polti
were all destroyed, together with not less
than twenty men.
Three men (two firemen snd a ship's
steward) were happily ashore, taking
cargo on the Island beach, at the time
of the explosion, and three others, In
cluding Dan Hook, were now dragged
into the boat, one at his last gasp, and
unconscious. But these represented the
sole survivors, and a terrible heavy death
roll remained.
Roy had already effected one rescue,
and a small cabin boy,, who was right
forward at the time of the explosion and
escaped by a miracle, had been dragged
Into safety as he rose half strangled to
the surface. . ..v
At last the boat reached the scene of
the catastrophe snd parsed hastily to
whore evidences appeared of life. Three
men had swum to the rocks, and the first
sound In Bessie's ears was the sound of
her sweetheart's voice, crying to them
that pc was safe and unharmed.
The awtul tension of th^se endless mo
ments which passed before their boat
could return chiefly tried tbose among
the rescuers who were inactive, for the
men at the oars h^d no time to think.
But to one beyond all the rest this
â¢vent appealed with crushing and dis
tracting significance, nnd into the mind
of Elizabeth Ogllvie fell such a night of
horror-stricken grief as happily descends
upon the life of few yomr-n.
In a moment all that was dearest to
her in tbo world had bÂ»en ewept away.
Roy, indeed, might still ll\-e if hÂ« hart
escaped the descending spar, but in that
eea of sharks the chances were against
the escape of any one who had occupied
the sunken boat; while as for those on
the steamer it was mere hope run mad
to believe a single soul could have sur
vived the explosion.
Bessie uttered no sound, gave no sign
of her agony; but she kept her straining
eyes on the sea, while Fain and Lord
Wlnstone watched her closely, fearful
that she might lose her self-control.
The watchers saw more than this, for
their sister boat, though happily out of
reach of the original explosion, being well
clear of the ship at the time, was now
struck and sunk by a heavy spar drop
ping into it from aloft.
The sulphurous clouds rose and hung
like a pall over the scene of death and
ruin; screams and groans came c.?arly
to the awe-etricken spectators, and the
sea, as It grew smoother, was covered
with bisck ppecks and streaks of bloody
foam, little lakes or oil, fragments of the
thousand things that had filled the ship,
barrels, patches and shreds of canvas,
shattered timbers, a torn red ensign,
gaudy cotton goods floating In ribbons,
fragments of books and papers, the dust
of cinders, the stain of coal, dead fish,
awful fragments of the flesh of the dead
and living men fighting their last battle
and losing It.
Seablrds shrieked over the desolate
scene and the sunshine filled the smoke
with a dazzle of light as each billow of
It expanded and thinned and ro^e highf-r
and higher above the theater of the
tragedy.
Kven within fifty yards Df thoÂ«-Â« who
mercifully escaped heavy masses of wood

fallen; but now the startled and heavins
fiea grew calm again, save by struggling
life, and the boat, driven by stout arms
and bending oars, came racing bark to
save any who had not already passed be
yond salvation.
The note was sharp and clear. It fell
like a knife on the ear, like a heavy blow
against the heart. For a moment they
sat dazed and stunned; then, gasping and
with faces grown pale, they looked in the
direction of the Morning Star.
The ehlp had vanished, and In her place
a tremendous column of yellow pmolte
ascended Into the blue sky, then billowed
hugely out, as a cloud billows to meet a
waterspout. A hell of stinking vapor had
suddenly burst from the Morning Star,
and now, after ghastly moments of si
lence, came the thundering smash of
heavy objects falling into the water.
An awful chaos of tumbling waves, bat
tered and lashed to foam by falling tim
ber and iron, now spread where the great
mass of the shio had laid. The catas
trophe had blown her afterpart to pieces,
hurling huge masses aloft, while the stem,
now completely separated from the rest,
had gone down entire and a great whirl
pool hissed and yawned above it.
It was at this moment that the second
officer In the distant boat had uttered the
last remark recorded: and now a horri
fied cry escaped his lips and every ear
was hurt by the sound of a terrific ex
plosion.

Incident distracted those on the boat for
a moment and they paddled In the direc
tion of tho reptile, while Hook Instantly
began to relate picturesque yarns con
cerning' turtles In general and his own ex
periences with them in particular.
Captain Ogllvie, however, did not share
this distraction. Polti's continued delay
angered him. It was already long past
â¢ o'clock and, according to his original
plan, the boats ere this should have been
ten mflcs on their way. Now he used
some sailor's language and, hurrying to
the top of the companion, shouted a few
sharp words down it
"If rou're not In the boat In . half a
minute, Signor Poltl, It goes without you.
Now, oneâ twoâ three â four" â
"Stayâ stayâ arrest the boat! I come,
but I must be slowâ I"â
He appeared at the bottom of the lad
der, forgot the list of the ship, slipped
when half way up and uttered a shrlli
scream of terror as the big leather case
he carried dropped from his hand and fell
fifteen feet to the deck below.
Few had appetite for food, but the
wounded suffered terribly from thirst. To
these Lord Winstone and Tracy Fain min
istered as best they could, spreading for
them In the little caves along the shore
some of the bales of cloth already taken
out of the Morning Star and thus giving
them comfortable couches out of the sun's
glare.
Meldrum was wholly occupied with
Elizabeth, who now suffered severely
from the after, effects of the shock and
the consciousness of her uncle's terrible
death. W
Roy, himself absolutely unhurt, tramped
the hot sand and found ty his great de
light some turtle's eggs. Of these he
made a sort of dismal mess in a tin pan
and patiently cooked it under the impres
sion he was preparing an omelet for Bea
dle.
Not until the evening, when the grirl
was peacefully sleeping in a little cavern,
high and dry above thu sea, did Meldrum,
Winstone and Tracy Fain meet together
and discuss the past and future.
vThe guns are all right," said his Lord
ship, "and nothing else matters."
Conscious from Boy's stars that this
remark sounded unutterably cynical to
other ears, ho proceeded:
"I mean nothing else matters to us now.
God is aware how bitterly I deplore the
awful loss of life, and he know3 that i
would have gladly given myself if any
one of those poor fellows coutd have
lived; but the reason of Providence's acts
la bidden from man. We ara permitted
to remain, while others, as good and bet
ter, are snatched to their last account.
Now we must look forward. And, as J
said, the guns are left." .
"How did it happen.'" asked Fain. "You
wcro nearer than we were, Roy. Can
you add anything to what we know?" >
I>ord Winstone, who was h!mÂ«elf fa
miliar with Swahlli. the vernacular of
Zanzibar, chose a couple of head '
men for his troop and bade
each collect five and
twenty experl-
Seeing the expedition was one of peace,
Lord Winstone did not entirely agree
with the German, and it was finally set
tled that fifty porters and a small party
of ten or twelve Soudanese under arms
would bÂ« sufficient.
As for the remainder of the crew, with
the first and Second officers of the Morn-
Ing Star, it may here be said at once that
they, too, reached Zanzibar from Mafia
a fortnight later, and conveyed to that
port the cargo eaved from the Morning
Star before she was blown up. Subse
quently all returned to England, being
conveyed as distressed British seamen In
a British steamer.
Once at Zanzibar, Meldrum found much
to do before he could depart into the In
terior, and his modest ideas were quickly
shown to be too small for the task and
Its dancers.
Permission to take a hunting party to
lake Mweru was granted by tho German
representative at Zanzibar, but he urged
the employment of a considerable number
of Zanzlbarl or Wamyamwezl porters, to
cether. with a dozen at least of well
armed fighting men: and he assured the
leaders of the expedition that the greater
the number they took with them In rea
son, the smaller would be the fear of
savage attack.

The ahort Journey to Mafia Island was
â¢oon completed. , and the longer one to
Zanzibar occupied a week in a fast little
sailing ship and proved wholly unevent-
.''Speaking' roughly, â¢ It Is 750 miles as a
crow files from this place. Saadanl. to
the southern shore of Lake; Mweru,
where â¢â¢ we shall hit the river Luapula.
The country to be traversed Is very di
versified and we shall make most un
equal'progress, sometimes doing our five
and even bIx miles a day on the plains,
more often putting in three to three and a
half miles.";. We. will add to the 750 miles
of {'total -distance another 200, which Is
f airly, liberal, and we get 850 miles. Add
fifty more for the distance down the Lua
pula to the Wambasl tributary, which
leads Into the Bacontas country, and we
get 1000 miles. Assume a progress of
three miles a day and we have about 333
days to complete the outward Journey.
That, as a matter of fact. Is pretty much
what we shall do, if things go reasonably
right, though, of course, at times we shall
push along a good deal faster. I will ven-:
ture to prophesy that the total trip takes
rather more than a year and a half; that,
if fate is kind, we shall get to the Ba
toncas early In December, and that we
are home again Inside two years."
Meldrum gasped.
"Oood heavens, Fred, you don't mean
that?"
"Is It possible, my dear fellow, you
made no calculation before you started?"
"Rather so; any amount; but they were
Jolly different ones."
"Based on your own powers of walk-
Ing along a turnpike road plentifully
dotted with places of refreshments â eh?"
"Not exactly, but I certainly reckoned
on ten to twelve miles a day."
"Walt till you see the countryâ the for

we must eat. and to kill game for a big
party means a long halt and a rest and

"Mrs. Baker went with her husband to
the lakes," aha said, "and there are many
English ladles In the very heart of Africa

thing I've got now. You mustn't ask me
to. Just think what my life would ba

Argument was vain, and as a sign of de
feat Meldrum finally bought a fine white
riding ass for Bessie's especial benefit and
a snug little doublet for her. while an ex
perienced German lady at Saadanl assist
ed the girl to make a variety of necessary
purchases, and a smart Knfflr boy of fif
teen, to whom she toqk & fancy, was
appointed hor special servant.
Lord Wlnstone, finding Miss
Â¦ Ogilvie absolutely determ
ined, advised Roy to
marry her before" the
expedition started,
but. though the
suggestion was
pleasant enough.
ThÂ© expedition was f now fully equipped
and on the mainland, 'at Saadanl, and the
following morning I would | see It set forth
down the river Mukcf.dogwa in five boats.
One ; startling Incident has . yet to be
mentioned: Elizabeth Ogilvle begged to
be allowed to accompany the party. Hex
pluck* none doubted, but Mcldrum loved
his sweetheart too 'dearly to agree to such
a petition. ? \
Lord Winstone was of the same mind,
while Fain, on the contrary, supported
the girl's plea and saw no reason why one
so intrepid, so courageous and so strong
should not accompany them; He now af
fected a purely platonic attachment to
Bessie, and she, ever ready to credit all
men with good motives, was glad to pos
sess, his friendship and thankful that the
painful incident of the past had been bur
ied and forgotten.
But no arguments, other than those ad
vanced by Bessie herself, would have
moved Roy. He dimly guessed at the ter
rible difficulties and dangers before them,
and he hated the thought that the girl he
loved better than anything In the world
should be exposed to so much unneces
sary misery; while Lord Wlnstone, who
knew .better than Meldrum the nature of
the task before them, was also strongly
opposed to the suggestion. Bessie had
carried her way, however, and reminded
Roy of many reasons why she should go.
One other painful Incident, besides the
death of the carrier, had occurred during
Ihe preliminary stages of- the expedition.
The advance guard were armed with
Remingtons, and 'one of these -men was
caught in the act ;of sailing bis ."weapon to
a chief of a small. tribe for Hfty.hea.ds of
Indian corn'. .* The "awful danger of such
a course could not be over-estimated, as
the safety, of the entire company might
many times depend upon their defensive
powers. Â» "Â«/
Wlnstone reluctantly advi?ed hanging
the robber, as a necessary lesson to the
rest, and Fain agreed with him, but Mel
drum pursued a more tender course. Aa
yet his followers were untried, and his
heart was not so hard as experience of
the foolish Zanzlbaris and sh:fty Souuan
ese presently promised to make it
"He shall be flogged," said Roy.
It was explained to the sinner that only
his master's mercy had saved his life, and
he was then flogged by his own head
man, a lean and wiry Arab. who. with
Dan Hook's eye upon him. did his work
well. The warrior stood his punishment
stolidly, but next morning it was reported
that he had deserted, and with him went
his Remington and half a box of ammu
nitionâas much as he could carry.
This happened two days before they
reached the last stage, that the boats
could make; and then came a morning
when, rounding a bend in the; river, a
great horseshoe-shaped fall, nearly forty
feet high, barred further progress.
Others, only less tremendous, had been
successfully passed below, but after a
survey of the ugly and rock-scattered
rapids that saread above the- M'posa
Falls, Meldrura determined to carry tha
boats no further. -
Â¦ The spot was well salted to tha making
of the usual camp, and tha leaders of the
party decided upon a stay of a week, to
put all In order, prepare the system of
loads and lay in an extra stock of food
against the unknown forests and prairies
before them. The routs was also to bÂ«
carefully studied and planned and the
tents and camp furniture overhauled.
These things were dons and at tne end of
three days the boats set forth for home,
their departure reducing tha expedition
by fifteen men.
The future route was mapped put. and
ample stores collected from adjacent vil
lages. Indeed, matters progressed so sat
isfactorily and speedily ' that lleldrum
changed his Intention and declared an
earlier start than that determined upon
might be mad*.
Lord Wlnstone, with a couple of Zanzi
baris and Dan Hook, had gone afield that
morning, however, and on returning his
Lordahlp reported the tracks of heavy
game within two mile* of camp. There
a mass of mingled spoor had delighted the

"We have a clear day," he said, "and

Of course Meldrum Immediately aban
doned his n'ew notion of pushing forward
and It was decided to spend one day with
big garce.
That night the two sportsmen made" 1
ready their batteries and each selected
three men to accompany him as bear
ers. Fain and Dan Hook were to remain
in cam?, and Elizabeth, though desirous
to join the shooting party with a light
shotgun that Roy had bought her at Zan
zibar, wag, of course, not permitted to
do so.
In her neat dress of holland, with short
skirt and long gaiters to the knee, Bes
sie had her special servant, Bungani, a
bright Kaffir lad, and Raalt. an Arab, the
head man of the second Zanzibar detach
ment, had a little Â»oort on her own ac
count, but she ran no risks and never
strayed far from the "boma"' or fence
of brushwood which encircled the camp,
having promised Roy not to lose sight
of It.
Meantime Tracy Fain, who was ap
pointed chronicler of thÂ» expedition,
spent a day en bis diary, wbi'e thfe hunt-
Ing party with provisions for a four and
twenty hours' excursion, had already set
out at daybreak.
They had made their way to neighbor
ing high land, beneath whfch lay the wa
ter hole and beyond which to the skyline
extended fine hunting country , of alter
nate bush and prairie. The former pre
dominated around the water hole, but
beyond It a blrdseye view of plains, tree
dotted, could be observed, and with his
glass Lord Winstone made out a few buf
falo and jimall antelope grazing peace
fully in company not more than two
milts distant. The wind necessitated a
lengthy stalk, but taking their bearings
carefully both men descended from the'
bluff, passed the water hole upon their
left hand and then, getting through the
scrub belt below, which was chiefly com
posed of prickly acacia, separated until
half a mile parted them.
Each had his bearers behind him and
so began their stalk. For an hour' they
pursued a snakellkfc way within sight of
each other, then a high bed of reeds cam*
between them, and beyond It tha prospect
was altogether .hidden.
Roy had now to pursue hiÂ» way by
compass through a bed of sere grass three
feet high. This proved difficult and pain
ful, for the stuff was harsh and tough
and cut the big man's face and hands aa
he pushed steadily forward, mnir^r for
a point where a tree stood.
Unknown to Roy, a, little clearing here
existed; the grass grew green and lush
and a streamlet wound sluggishly through
narrow channels of red mud. As ha strug
gled out upon the bank of It a cry of
birds rang in his ears and he found that
Immediately ahead of him stood the mi
mosa tree he had striven to reach.
Dimly through the grass at It* foot
heaved up a round mass of soma dark
ish substance and Roy, believins; It a
sort of ant heap different In kind to any
he had seen as yet, was about to Investi
gate, when, aroused by the shrill hissing
and din of the birds, the mass moved,
turned and lifted an enormous 'head oa
which two lofty horns appeared.
Meldrum had surprised a- rhinocerosâ
a big cow. as the length" and thinness of
Its front horn testified; and now the awak
ened monster, with a grunt like a huge
pig. slowly rose to Its feet, sniffed the
air, then fixed small eyes on the disturber
of Its siesta. Only thirty yards separated,
man and beast, as It was difficult to say
at that critical moment which showed
greatest surprise.
Instinctively, though never before that
moment In the presence of big game, the
Englishman dropped his .577 express and
stretched his arm behind him for his
heavy four-bore', which should have been

rhino, had fled like one man. each leaving
his load where he turned.
Meldrum fell bacK, keeping his eye on
the rhinoceros. Then his foot struck the
four-bore, and as he bont to pick It up
the great animal before him suddenly be

its head down, Its lean tail In thÂ» a!r.
The sportsman had barely time to get
his gun to his shoulder and discharge it
at a range of fifteen yards. Luckily for
Roy the shot saved his life, though not by
destroying bis foe. He had never fired
the four-bore until that moment, and the
terrible recoil nearly broke his collar bone
and hurled him headlong backward to
the ground.
The rhinoceros always charges the

straight ahead, with gathering velocity."
and as Meldrum rose a scream behind
him announced that one of his flytng
bearers had been overtaken.
The smoke cleared, the rhinoceros pur

had escaped returned, one from an aca-

rta up which he had climbed oblivious to
Its awful thorns, the other from the bush.
But Achmet the poor wretch who had
been running madly forward In the track
of the rhinoceros, was smashed as by
the blow of an express train. The brute's
greater horn had gone through his back,
and then lifting its head, it had tossed
him ten yards behind It The man's body
was mangled to a jelly and his neck brok
en In his fall.
The discharge of the big gun had, of
course, frightened the game which Roy
and his friend were stalking; it had also
summoned Lord Wlnstone, who quickly
appeared to help if possible, being pretty
sure that Meldrum must have come sud
denly upon something more Inviting or
more pressing than the buffalo.
He heard the story, assisted to remove
from the dead man's corpse his accou
terments. then directed the awe-stricken
bearers by bury their comrade and read
them a sermon on obedience and cour
age as they did so.
"Never forget this lesson." he said.
"Remember the reward of him who flies
from his master In the hour of need. Do
your duty and all will be well; fail in it
and death will reward youâ death at the
hand of our enemies or in the Jaws of
fierce beasts."
This sudden destruction of their serv
ant naturally changed the plans of the
party. Three of the /remaining bearers
were quite unnerved by the sudden death
of their companion, and clearly would be
of little further use; while even had that
not been the case, iueldrum might have
hesitated to pursue sport after this un
fortunate event He himself was unin
jured save for a tremendous bruise on bis
right shoulder.
They returned slowly toward camp,
and Wlnstone, carrying his own heavy
rifle, followed the track of the galloping
rhinoceros until it reached high reeds
that rose to a tall man's shoulder. The
entrance of the beast was marked by a
v.-lde downtreadlng of this growth, but
no drop of blood or other evidence that
Meldrum's shot had st-uck her appeared.
"End on, the horn of a rhino shields
his brain," explained the elder sports
man. "Now, we'll climb the bluff again
and see what that reed patch looks like
from above. With luck we may have her
yet"
They passed the water hole and then
began to climb the steep ground beyond
It Raised a couple of hundred feet his
lordship swept the ground below and
satisfied himself that the spot In which
the murderous foe wa*> now concealed
extended for some fifty yards in one di
rection and a hundred in the other. It
was surrounded by open ground and no
forest or other obstacle approached
within a quarter of a mile of It Lord
Wlnstone shut up his glass with a snap.
"The brute's there and to be bagged,"
he saii. "You've had enough for one
day, Roy, eo call a halt and look on,
and I'll take Yosef down with me and
etlr her up. The other men are all
showing the white feather. They're only
born to be beasts of burden; but they'll
get braver presently."
"If you go I go," answered Meldrum.
"I'm all right and I owe the beggar one
surely."
"With two guns, she should be a cer
tainty. Either you hurt her. In which
case she'll be on the lookout and dan
gerous, or else you missed her, in which
case her burst of temper at being waked
wp is over, and she's very likely to *e
going to sleep again. We'll give her
half an hour, then start and revenge the
poor devil she smashed. Look through
my glasses and tell me If you see any
buphaga. birds clustering over the place."
"Yes," eatd Meldrum, after a careful
Inspection.^ "The birds are there; and,
what's more," he added, "I believe; I can
see the beast Itself lying down."
He pointed to the spot, but his friend
would not commit himself to a definite
declaration. Together with the native,
Ycsef, and Blackbird, a practiced hun
ter, they Bet out each carrying his
heaviest gun, while the servant held
their eight - bores, and the expresses
were left behind on the bluff. In twenty
minutes they had reached the reed clump
and begun their search. Then, guided
by the fluttering of birds, the proceeded
Inch by inch until a well-worn and miry
wallow in the heart of the brake showed
evidences of regular occupation.
"With luck we may find more than
one," whispered Lord Wlnstone. "But It's
your first shot, so come along. If the
birds only keep quiet ycu'll find her as
easy to kill as a milch cow.
In ten minutes the gray bulk of thje rhi
noceros was distinctly visible through tbe
grass. Two birds were busy picking tbe
ticks off her; the rest had fluttered some
distance away.
"She'll run up wind," whispered Wln-
Etone, "so you stand here and give her
the shoulder shot as Boon as she's on her
legs. I'll go along a little; you could al
most walk up to the brute now and kick
her while she sleeps the sleep of the Just!
Tell Yosef to shout and fling a stone at
her when I wave my hat That'll wake
her up."
A few moments later loud shouts dis
turbed the silence, from where Yosef
stood by a little mimosa on rising ground,
and rhipo bicomls arose In her wrath.
Her forehead was spattered with gore and
her horns were still red with the life
blood of unhappy Achmet
As Wlnstone had predicted, the beast
prepared to go off up wind and presented
a fair shoulder shot to Roy. The heavy
rifle crashed out and rhino, with a
smashed shoulder blade and four ounces
of lead In its heart fell to rise no more.
The delighted hunter pushed forward
and was Just approaching his fallen prey
when a second shot echoed close at hand
and the thundering charge of another rhi
noceros made the ground shake. It came
galloping on, bleeding from the mouth,
and ran straight into Its fallen compan
ion, then recovered Itself and whirled
round and round helplessly, after the
manner of those beasts when shot
through the lungs.
It did not see Meldrum, who was with
in five yards of It upon the other side of
the dead rhinoceros, but suddenly mark
ing Blackbird, who stood not fifty yard's
off. It put Its head down, its tail up and
charged him, while blood epouted upward
through Its nostrils. '
Yosef fired and fled; while the negro
hunter also flred twice, missed with his
first bullet which screamed dangerously
close to Roy, but staggered the enemy
with a second ehot, and then, showing
wonderful ability and nerve, swung him
self Into the fork of the young mimosa
tree behind him and prepared to mark
the direction of the wounded beast when
it regained the reeds.
He reckoned without his host for his
coign of vantage lay directly In the road
of the rhinoceros, and a moment later,
with head down and quite oblivious as
to where be was going, the great crea
ture had struck Blackbird's mimosa fair
ly and squarely and swept the slight tree
before It like a straw. It snapped off two
feet from the ground and the huntsman
aloft came down on hands and knees
upon the back of the rhinoceros.
This was probably about the' best place
be could have fallen upon, at In another
moment he tumbled 'to earth dear of the
creature and out of reach of molestation.
But rhino's days were done, his last
mimosa leaf eaten, his last rollick in the
red mud ended. After the collision with
the tree ho slowed down, then staggered
on his knees, still blowing blood, and
finally rolled over upon his side and
kicked away his life In a few mighty
gasps and struggles.
Lord Wlnstone arrived well pleased, for
the creature proved a fine bull, half as
large again as the cow which Meldrum
had slain. His front horn was twenty
eight inches, his second horn but three
inches shorter.
It transpired that the hunter, all eyes
for his friends and ready to help Roy In
a moment if necessary, had nearly
walked on top of the second beast shot It
in the shoulder at a range of ten yards,
then leaped aside as rhino charged the
. smoke and shouted to his companions, in
time to warn them of the oncoming dan
ger.
Now they returned to the bluff from
which, their other bearers had witnessed
the scene below and, later on. having re
gained camp, sent half a dozen men, with
Yosef for the horns of the dead monsters.
To carry them forward was out of the
question, but the trophies were buried two
feet under ground, at the camp, in hope
that did the expedition return by the
same route. It might be possible to re
cover them in the. future. -
That night, while Bessie lay asleep in
her snug little tent and the wood fires
glimmered In the camp Roy sat and
smoked and listened to Wlnstone, while
the Zanzibaris, save the watchmen on
duty, slept and snored under the stars.
CHAPTER XL
The Rubeho Mountains lay as a mist
on the southwestern horizon as Roy Mel
drum's expedition set forth upon Its first
foot march at dawn on the following day.
The road proceeded not far from the
slaughtered rhinoceroses, and as the col
umn passed within 200 yards of them a
few started to see the sight while a halt
was called. Among these were Bessie and
Tracy Fain, but they quickly returned to
report that the dead monsters had at
tracted other attention than that of vul
tures and hyenas. They had been sys
tematically cut up and their hides were
removed, doubtless for making shields
and utensils by the fortunate native find
ers.
"We are now in a land where doubt
begins to exist as, to the nature and dis
position of the aborigines," said Lord
Winstone. "Fifteen miles or so of open
country lie ahead and then we come to
the forest All's well until we get there;
but once In it danger hides behind every
tree, and the man who falls out or strays
to right or left is as good as dead."
The sullen green fringe of woods was
reached in two days, and his Lordship,
at Meldrum's request, solemnly addrassej
the column, urged every member of it to
take no risk," assured them all of the
awful danger and almost certain
that awaited the wanderer, and pointed
out how disobedience would most cer
tainly be followed by a terrible punish
ment
"It is not from the anger of your lead
ers that you will suffer, but by the heavy
hand of Allah," he concluded. "Here
any error, any act of folly, must be in
stantly punished by nature, and the sav
age deities of these wild places. Obey,
and all will be well with us; disobey and
the hyenas will gnaw your bones; poison
will rot you; death will make his dally
feast of you."
With this grave caution, the expedition
set forth, and In half an hour, led by
Meldrum, the pioneers were hard at it
cutting, chopping and tearing a way
through the tropic vegetation. Roy him
self labored at this heavy task until
urged to desist The more methodical
Zanzibaris, though possessed of half his
strength, yet made better progress, and,
foot by foot the expedition wormed itself
Into the gloom of the woods.
Under r their luxuriance no sun could
penetrate. Aloft, indeed, sun glints like
stars twinkled in the dense foliage, but
It was only on rare occasions that the
bewildering, seething, fighting armies
of trees and creepers, hosts and para-
Bites, thinned out to give the sweeter
air and purer light any opportunity to
penetrate.
At such places, where some tree that
was young when Christ was hung on
the cross had fallen In Its old age to
the lightning and tempest and now lay
extended, a bleached giant whose rot
ten wood fed a million ants -and crawl-
Ing centipedes, at such spots a mist of
golden sunlight indeed winnowed
through the woods, and aloft small
apes leaped and chattered and parrots
screamed and flaunted their gaudy col
ors as they climbed among the scarlet
berries of the Dhryna and hunted for
nuts and fruits. But glimpses of such
a sort were rare and progress proved
slow Indeed â a belt of forest some fifty
miles across occupying fifteen days In
transit ,
On the third day, dead to the warn
ings poured out for their benefit two
Zanzibaris. Salem and Ferez, weary of
the rations of rice, plantains and plan
tain flour, fell out and went foraging
for mushrooms and wood beans to vary
the monotony of their food.
When camp was pitched both men
were missing, and not until the follow
ing day did one crawl Into the protected
circle of the encampment Ferez had
been slain and fallen to a dozen simul
taneous spears; Salem had escaped with
life, but was severely wounded In the
thigh and arm.
He described the natives as of dark
color and great stature. Bee them he
could not until they were almost upon
him, for they pressed their bodies upon
the ground like snakes and hid themselves
with extraordinary cunning in shadows
or at the roots of trees.
Often in his struggle to get back to
camp he had passed near a savage and
believed the man a stock or stone until
a sudden movement and the scream of
a sp%ar had convinced him of his error.
Salem had slain two savages and his
life was saved by the fact that he had
never allowed his rifle out of bis hand;
but hÂ« explained that the other unfortu
nate, weary of the weight of It, actually
set his weapon against a treo stem and
wandered, unarmed, until death suddenly
overtook him.
Five days after the entry into the for
est of Roy's expedition came upon a na
tive village In a clearing. The savages
had fled to a man, long before Meldrum
and his party arrived; but a woman,
lurking In a plantain grove, was captured
and brought before the explorers.
Lord Wlnstone could not make her un
derstand Swahili, but the Arab, Raalt
whose private slave-dealing adventures
had acquainted him with divers different
dialects, found out the woman was a Ma
pora; that the main stronghold of the
tribe lay right ahead, far beyond the for
est and that her people were very strong
and would certainly show flght
"They know the flre medicine and do not
fear it," eaid the woman. "They will ao-
swer your guns with 10,000 spears, for they
flght to the death against those who
would take their children into slavery."
Meldrum tried hard to explain that his
party had nothing to do with the slave
raiders, but the woman evidently disbe
lieved him. Finally, however, she con
sented to proceed to her friends, who lay
hidden two miles off In the forest A
necklace of large glass beads was given
her, and a present, which she promised
should be conveyed to the monarch of the
Mapora, whose headquarters were twenty
days' march from the village In the wood,'
was also intrusted to her. She was prom
ised further handsome gifts if her kin.
Kanatto, should prove friendly.
The woman departed and, at any rate,
so fax* as her own little community was
concerned, the gifts did good, for soon
the savages came flocking back fearless
ly, helped the Zanzibaris to cut plantains
and showed great friendship.
Their head manâ a grandson of Kanat
to'sâassured Meldrum that his grandfath
er, once convinced that the column had
nothing to "do with the cursed Arab slave
traders, would welcome it gladly in so
far as his own territory and nation were
concerned. Then Meldrum received wel
come gifts In the shape of two goats and
a fowl. Bessie had the latter; it made
three meals for her, and was an invalu
able change.
At the Mapora village a halt of two
days was called, and plantains sufficient
for ten days' provisions per man secured
at reasonable cost of beads and wire.
Such a store, with an occasional dip
into the reserve stores of tinned meats
and milk for the white men, would en
able the expedition to reach I the head
quarters of Kanatto, supposing that mon
arch returned a favorable answer to their
petition.' ' , . Â¦ .
During the brief halt at this spot the
natives made great mystery about a for
est god known as the Elephant spirit,
who . had his home a few miles distant,
near a deserted village. The spirit, which
was very powerful, had been seen by hun
dreds of adventurous Mapora and .ap
peared well known to the whole \ tribe,
though whether a good or evil demon
none could tell, g
It appeared in shape like a man, but
of huge stature, and .while some natives
maintained that it sat motionless and
made no sign, others declared that they
had Been It signal them to depart from
ita presence, ' and others again solemnly
sw^re that the monster had leaped to
ward them and chased them from the for
est with unearthly cries.
The Elephant Spirit was said to be
green In color and 'of forbidding aspect. It
dwelt where the elephants were most
wont to congregate and was supposed to
be their guardian and protector. No Ma
pora would have dreamed of attempting
to slay an elephant within a considerable
distance o.f the green monster's domain.
These th'ings were explained to Wln
stono and Meldrum and while listening
with all respect to the narrative as told
by Kanatto's grandson, they yet permit
ted themselves some doubt in" the privacy
of their own tent after the chieftain re
tired.
"I had suspected a big ape," said his
lordship, "but for the fact that no such
thing is recorded hereabout Chimpanzees
have bfeen known to grow to an awful
size, and gorillas are of course still larger,
but the last named monster is a west
coast customer, and though chimpanzees
are reported pretty far east, yet none
have ever been heard of, to my knowl
edge, near this district If they are here,
my zoology is all wrong." "
"Beside, the brute la ereen." .
"That's nothing. These people are
vagueness Itself about colors. Some nig
ger orica vtfwed the' thing,' whatever fit
may be, was green; -then all the rest
stuck to it forever afterward. The legend
appears to me too widespread to be "whol
ly false. Nine-tenths of their talk is lies,
but there's some more or less Interesting
foundation In fact for most of their sto
ries, I fancy; and as to-morrow will be
our last halt of any duration for a con
siderable time, I'll go and see if I can get
an Interview with their prize hobgoblin."
Next morning Roy, much to his surprise,
had a touch of fever, and Fain, not car
ing for the proposed excursion, stopped
with him. while Lord Winstone, Dan
Hook, with three Zanzibarl carriers, two
native hunters of the Mapora and Black
bird, set out to the regions ruled by the
elephant spirit
The aborigines led them a trying Jour
ney over a deserted -clearing, where the
road extended along slippery tree trunks,
above fetid marshes and through gor-.
geous tangles of climbing convolvulus, or
chids and dense undergrowth. At last
the guides arrived at a little patch of
plantains and refused to proceed.
The place was the site of an old village,
but had been deserted for countless years,
and the ruined hutÂ» were now absolutely
obliterated under tangles and torrents of
wild living things. Only here and there
through masses of lush green stuck Â»up
the rotten. Bun-bleached - skeletons of
poles and props indicating the work of
man; but all soon promised to, vanish, for
nature had already sown the clearing
with young trees which rose above their
ancestors anS dominated the last evidence
of man's presence.
Elephant tracks were plainly visible on
the edge of the plantain patch, and,
through the deep silence of the desolate
place, their heavy bodies could be heard
crashing through the woods not a quarter
of a mile off.
But Winstone was after the green
eplrit, not the pachyderms it was sup
posed ' to protect, and he had to pursue
his lnveÂ«tlgatlon alone, for even the Zan-
Eibari boys and Blackbird now declined
to accompany him. The welrdness of the
place had awakened fear In them, and
the latter said: . *-''
"Big game me know and savage beasts
me fear not but what is dls? Who be
fore or since de Prophet hab heard ob a
giant green elephant spirit more huge dan
de tallest man, more vast dan Bana
Mkuba, our Great Master?"
"All right â as you please. Tou'll come,
Dan, of course?"
But Mr. Hook was not, at all sure.
"It's like this," he said, scratching his
head. "Blame me If I doan't reckon these
heathen toads to be in the right for once;
I ban't. 'feared of anything. In reason;
but theer*s a good deal in these here
plaguy plantations as have made me

"Well, give me the four-bore, and wait,
all of you, until I return. If I fire, you'd
better push on after me; if not, flre your
selves every ten minutes or so to tell
me where you are; and flre in the air.
He > departed alone, pushed forward
through the purple stems of the plan- J
tains, and soon found himself In unut
terable loneliness and desolation. Three
hundred yards from the starting point
the shining stems and tattered foliage of
the grove thinned out somewhat, and
after proceeding some fifty yards further
the explorer discovered himself In an
open space ringed about with trees and
having some rising land at the center.- A
hundred yards distant rusty- masses of
Ironstone preceded an undulation in the
flat country, and toward the base of one
tall, block his Lordship descried an ob
ject which made him rub his eyes with
frank amazement. Â¦ â¢
Near the foot of the rock, his back
against It, and shadowed entirely from
the sun's light by a natural grotto in the
stone, sat an enormous man or ape. Its
Â¦ stature was colossal, though smaller ,by
far than the natives had described;' Its
naked body was bright green; Its hands
were folded over Its breast; Its misshaped
head was bent forward, and wild, snaky
hair, also of vivid green, fell luxuriantly
around It, while pressed upon Its crown
was a wreath of flowers.
So natural appeared the pose that Win
stone, contrary to his reason, almost ex
pected to see the huge hermit rise, stand
upon Its feet and. approach him; but the
thing did not do so. .Its position was curi
ous, for It sat in a sort of niche on the
red sandstone boulder. There was no
. sound but the tinkle of falling water and>
.the distant intermittent echo of great
beasts, with an occasional crack like a
pistol shot, where an elephant had broken
a heavy bough or young tree.
In the midst of this strange kingdom,
silent, motionless and alone, with un
couth face . and distorted limbs, reigned
this huge green monster in mortal shape.
Lord Winstone got out his field glasses,
without which he never hunted, and
trained them on the grotto. He stared
awhile, and then his breath left his lungs
In a gasp of surprise, as he returned the
glasses to their case and pushed forward.
\ To reach the Elephant Spirit proved
difficult, for its grotto In the] mass of
stone opened twelve feet above the ground
and could only be approached after a
difficult climb up ladders of wild vine.
Falling water gushed in a beady stream
from the cavity aloft, and its path was
densely coated with small and slippery
vegetation, but the wanderer finally
reached his goal and * stood beside the
huge sitting figure. It moved not, nor
had it moved through years unnumbered
. and unknown, for it was the skeleton of
a man densely coated with more than
half a century's growth of tough green
moss and apparently bound together by
branches of a small water-loving and
flowering creeper, which, falling in a
stream from the skull, suggested green
hair bound about with bright blossoms.
Lord Winstone assumed that no man
would have perished in that position so
naturally, and some investigation showed
that the corpse had been' artificially
placed within this funeral niche.
Scraping the heavy growth of 'moss
from Its skull and neck, he discovered
that the bones were all fastened together
with stout bark thread. This had held
except in the case of the left foot, and
the little spYing, which, as it bubbled,
from the ironstone, had spattered the
dead body, served to explain the dense
and close accumulation of moss and
green lichen. on every bone,
j The dead man's skull, in the eye of
which , a yellow orchid flourished, was
of negroid type, but extraordinarily
larre; his only companions in solitude
\ were "some, unwholesome .looking efts,
iBpotted' like toadstools, which crawled
.quickly," away to their fastnesses In the
ferny, pool of the spring.
Other, evidences enabled the discoverer,
to arrive at a theory of this gigantic
corpse, for scattered about, each coated
as thickly with dense and rank mosses
as the skeleton Itself, lay various articles,
which superstition had there' burled with
the defunct savage.
A glimmer of red rust was all that re
mained of his spearheads, and the han
dles were nearly rotted ; awk', though
enough remained to identify tnem, while
an earthern Jar, doubtless containing
malwa. or native beer, in the far past,
now stood at the hand of the Elephant
Spirit, fyll of dead wood and rank trail
ing vegetation.
Lord Winstone had discovered the
quaint burial place of a chief and solved
the prime mystery of the Mapora.
But his Lordship knew the character of
the natives too well to present them with
this rational explanation of their precious
1 tradition. Instead, he patted the moss
down on the rotted bones again and stuff
ed the skeleton's broken ribs and jaws
with living green things; then, captur
ing one of the hideous newts, rully a foot
in length, he made It prisoner, worked
his way cautiously down the precarious
ladder of wild vine stems and soon reach-
At this moment a sound of the first dls
tantv gun signal reached the explorers
ears.^and, though the report came from
further off than he expected, he set his
face for it steadily and pushed forward
as quickly as possible.
Ten minutes later the gun fired again,
and he corrected his line of march by It;
but then, within the space of three min
utes from the last discharge, came a sud
den fusillade, the shots following each
other in rapid succession and sometimes
simultaneously.
Fearing a savage attack, he sped for
ward at a remarkable pace, considering
bis heavy rifle and the. nature of the
ground, but long before he could regain
his companions all firing ceased and he
moderated his pace, feeling that for his
own safety a careful approach to the
scene of action must now b$_ essential.
The road his little party pursued from
the main camp of the expedition had been
carefully blazed and the hunter was not
fearful of losing it, even without the na
tive guides, but to traverse it alone, sup
posing there had been treachery and his
friends slain, would be to court death.
Permitting himself no more gloomy re
flections until the realization of his fears.
Lord Winstone proceeded with the utmost
caution and it was only a loud shout of
two voices raised In laughter that caused
him to improve his pace with a lighter
heart
A strange scene met him, for his friends
had Indeed been Invaded during his ab
sence, though not by the -Mapora. A
small herd of elephants, pursuing their
resistless march, had crashed out of the
banana plantation within fifty yards of
the waiting party and Dan Hook.
Without a moment's reflection the mar
iner had opened flre and attracted the un
pleasant attention of a bull who received
the shot In the flank "and promptly
charged.
Far from hastening to his rescue tha
two Mapora, confident that the gree-n
Elephant Spirit would take terrible toll
for this outrage, fled with screams of fear
and the three coast men wavered, then
ran after the natives.
Blackbird alone stood firm and it was
lucky - for Hook that he did so, for the
sailor must have been overtaken and de
stroyed to i few moments had not the
hunter, with one of his master's rifles,
brought the infuriated beast to the
ground. With perfect nerve he awaited
the charge, and as the advancing ele
phant hesitated a moment at thirty
yards between its two enemies, shifted
his aim like lightning from the body shot
he had meant to fire and pointed his rifle
at its head..
One vulnerable spot on the forehead,
where the bone is thin, was his mark,
and as he fired, the Instant fall of the
big brute showed his aim was true. At
the same moment the Zanzibaris, who
had fled, began discharging their weap
ons, and the forest echoed to the rattle
of guns and the shrill trumpet of the
stampeded elephants. Â¦ .
When Wlnstone arrived Hook had scaled
the huge mass of his fallen foe and was
dancing-a hornpipe on It Blackbird clam
ored for the tusks, which proved a heavy
pair/ and would have amply repaid him
for his pluck and straight shooting; but
Wlnstone, 'when he heard of what had
happened, absolutely refused permission
to take a hair of the elephant Into camp.
"We dare not," he Mid. "As it is, you
cannot remove the ivory without help,,
if we brought a fragment Into camp it
might lead to grave trouble. I shall not
forget this day's work, and the Master
will not forget it, and Mr. Hook % wiU.not
forget It, either, my good Blackbird, but
you must wait for your reward until
later. We dare not tell the Mapora that
we have slain one ' of the Spirit's
elephants. They would do I know not
what, and Kanatto might refuse us a
peaceful march through his territory at
the very least."
/Hook was already heaping gifts upon
his preserver. - ~
"Tou'm a gude-fashloned heathen, any
way.-Blackbird, my son; an' I thank 'e;
an' my kids an' the missis, down Devon
shire way, would thank 'e If they knawed
what you'dt done. Here's my auld jack
knife, an' here's my tobacco box wi' a
butlvul plcter o' Plymouth harbor in the
lid of un; an', here's myâ" -
Lord Wlnstone Interposed, while Blade
bird, to whom Dan's conversation was
double Dutch, grinned and showed his
great yellow teeth and stretched his hand
'for more.
"That'll do, Dan, that'll do. Mr. Mel
drum will be responsible for the rest.
No call to beggar yourself."
"Well, then, I'll do more still for the
bloke. Tell un I'll tattoo his black hide
wi' a pair o' love birds a-flyin' in the
air an' a anchor an" a holy cross, an'
such like rare devilriesâ all free, gratia'
an' for nothin'."
The . expression of Blackbird's face at
the offer to tattoo a Christian cross up
on him had doubtless been Instructive
enough, seeing that he was a firm Mos
lem; but his Lordship attempted no trans
lation. V
Together the trio returned, and, thread-
Ing the difficult way, reached camp at
nightfall to find all well. They cowardly
Zanzibaris were disrated and deprived of
the distinction of weapon carrying, while
the Mapora were assured by Mr. Hook
that the elephant had made a mistake,
and seeing that it was a white man who
fired, had accepted an apology and as
sured him in elephant language no harm
was done.
As for the Green Spirit, Lord Winstone
reported his interview with the monster
most solemnly: It had showed him great
kindness, spoken well of the white men
and s^ht a gift of a wondrous spotted eft
to King Kanatto. It had also directed
that the expedition was to be allowed to
pass in peace through Mapora territory.
These things and the wretched newt in
a wicker cage were duly transported by
runners to the capital, and when Meldrum
and his friends made their march next
day it was with high hopes that the Im
mediate future might be considered prom
ising.
As, for Roy, Bessie's tender nursing and
a few doses of quinine had done him much
good, and, when the time came to start,
he was quite equal ,to the task of leading
his column forward through the aisles
and avenues and Jungles of the great for
est. A few cases of fevers and ulcers
were reported, but In the main the health
of the expedition continued excellent.
CHAPTER XIL
THROUGH KANATTO'S.
The long and weary struggle with the
great forest tract ended at last, and once
more the travelers stood under the clear
sky and breathed sweet air upon the grass
lands. They had plodded through won
drous wildernesses of lush andr reeking
green; they had faced the fevers that
arose like ghosts by'mgnt from the bogs
and swamps; they had struggled day after
day with the snake-like vegetation, the
wild vine and innumerable other creepers,
the pepper bush and huge arum; the wild
mango, almona, sword grass, gigantic
tree ferns, acacia, mimosa, phrynium, livid
fungus and thick moss, bedewed with the
warm moisture of the natural hothouse.
And yet, save for half a dozen cases of
fever and one death, the expedition was
sound.
Once on the rising plateaus that ap
peared after forest was past, the invalids
quickly recovered; and It was well that
they did so, for three days' march from
the mountain strongholds of Kanatto mes
sengers arrived from him. They came
empty-handed, but their mouths were full
of bad news.
Kanatto refused to believe that a party
of more, than fifty persons, with nearly
as many guns, could be engaged In any
peaceful enterprise. He denned the east
ern and southern confines of Mapora ter
ritory and expressed a hope the expedi
tion would follow them. He absolutely
declined to permit them to set foot In his
country, and declared that If any attempt
was made to do so. he should resist It
with 6000 Bpears. -x?i :".~;
Kanatto's messenger was polite, but
firm, and the white leaders, conscious how
much depended on It, treated him with
every courtesy and gave him presents of
considerable value. Winstone explained
to Roy that the route Indicated would ex
tend the total journey by at least 250
miles, a very serious consideration, and a
further halt was made, therefore, until
the natives bearing the eft and the mes
sage from the Elephant Spirit should
reach Kanatto and return.
It was hoped that Lord Winstone's ex
pedient might prove effective, and as the
first envoy from the monarch seemed
enormously Impressed by the Incident and
evidently attached much importance to
the green deity of the wood, both Fain
and Meldrum felt sanguine, though his
Lordship did not share their hope.
"It's good enough at least to wait for
his answer,' Fre'd," declared Roy one night
at a council of war held by the four white
men. Most of the expedition slept, and
strange eyes, like precious stones In pairs,
crept about outside the zareba; while now
was heard the howl of a hyena and now
the deep thunder of a lion's roar:
"I shouldn't wait If you ask meâ not
after to-morrow. Time is precious k and
we must make friends pretty soon or we
shall be in a fix for food and have to
take without . asking. We're not strong
enough to bluff Kanatto and march
through his kingdom without leave, for
the Mapora are a tremendously powerful
tribe, and If he'd said 19,000 spears Instead
of five X should have believed him. .But
he's cot enemies all round him, his first
messenger, told me yesterday. That' a a
rood thins as far as It goes, tor to be his
enemy will prove an excellent Introduc
tion to other tribes. If bad comes to
worse." - "**wâ
â¢Tll give Kanatto Â©as more day, then,
.Both Fain and I hoped a rood deal from
that speckled, toadllke beast yoa sent
to the monarch; we do still, for that mat
ter." i
Early In the morning Lord Wmstoosrs
fears were proved Ill-founded, and for
once a" hopeful view proved the correct
one. Kanatto. .powerful monarch though
he was. evidently, bent the knae to the
elephant spirit, and was disinclined to
disobey Its express order. He sent, though
with evident reluctance, to say that the
expedition mlgat pursue Its way through
his country, but must turn neither to
"right nor left, must neither hunt nor kill
game without the permission of the bead
men of the districts, and must pay fair
prices for plantains, goats and Â©the*
food. -*â¢Â¦-*
To make his permission the more era*
clous he sent one ox as a gift, and ex
plained that from the capital Onward 'to
the river Ruaha he would lend the ex
plorers a guard of fifty fighting Mapora
to be their escort. He also lncjulred the
course he was to pursue with the gift
from the Elephant Spirit.
To this fairly amiable message Mel
drum returned another as friendly. He
forwarded a selection of the best gifts
at his command, a brilliant scarlet coat,
lacÂ«d with gold braid, a cocked hat wi;h
red', feathers, and a picture book of wild
animals. He also, at Faln's suggestion,
directed Kanatto to slay the eft on the
third day of the new moon and anoint
the portals of Its capital with Its blood,
as a sign of friendship with the Elephant
Spirit and a promise of prosperity.
The rainy season was now at hand and
WinstonÂ© hoped that before the middle
of March, when steady and heavy down
falls must begin, the expedition might
find Itself on somewhat higher lands,
where there would be abundant cover,
but of a more healthy sort than that af
forded by the forests.
Five hours after the arrival of the mes
sengers camp was broken up and within
â¢an hour the expedition entered Kanatto's
territories. A sharp, lookout was kept
and military order maintained, for though
Wlnstone had Uttle fear of treachery, the
possibility yet existed.
Crowds of natives assembled on either
side of the moving column and here and
there a youngster flourished his spear and
looked warlike, but blows or sharp re
bukes from some oldei man speedily
Quieted tha most pugnacious.
As for Kanatto's messenger, a native
of fine aspect and almost Intellectual fea
tures, he marched at the head of the
Soudanese fighting men with Meldrum
and Lord Wlnstone.
Bessie, riding her white donkey, accom
panied them, for their road now lay upon
broad, well known tracks, and Kanat
to's envoy at his special request was per
mitted to walk beside her. The girl ex
cited his profound admiration, and Indeed
the spectators, ten deep on either side of
the line of march, showed similar wonder
and pleasure.
Lord Wlnstone, quick to catch a hint
from any incident of the passinr moment,
instantly realized that Bessie might be a
power; and during a halt for luncheon he
mentioned his opinion.
"She must be queen." he said, "and we
are her subjects. The idea will appeal to*
the average savage mind everywhere and
carry weight in our negotiations."
"She's a Jolly sight too retiring," said
Roy. f
"We must rive her a lesson then. Some
of our Zanzlbarls will show her how to
put on side." declared Tracy Fain.
"For that matter they call Miss Og!lvle
'queen' a'ready," explained Dan Hook. "I
mean our own squad do. 'Twas that Arab
cove's .idea, they tell me. Raalt thought
of it. She be called Silver Sunrise by 'em,
an* a purty name enoughs come to think
of It."
"I'll swear you never thought of any
thing so nice as that when you were
courting, Roy; come now?" laughed Lord
Wlnstone; and Meldrum admitted no
such poetio fancy had ever crossed his
Saxon mind.
"But it's a Jolly good name for all
that," he declared. "Queen of the Silver
Sunrise must Bessie be henceforth.".
"She will look the part, but won't play
it," declared Fain; then the bugler blew
his blast and the column moved forward
steadily.*
Splendid progress was made over the
healthy open and undulating lands of the
Mapora; Indeed, eight miles proved an
easy day's work, and on several occasions
ten was exceeded. Then the palisades of
Kanatto's capital appeared, perched, on a
little hill at an elevation of some 3000 feet
above the sea, and the monarch himself,
with his medicine man and retinue, came
forth to the wooden and monotonous thud
of drums and the blare of a huge Ivory
trumpet.
Kanatto wore the scarlet coat/ and
cocked hat, while a sky-blue petticoat
sent with special respect to his favorite
wife, had also appealed to his* fancy
and now covered his middle and descend
ed a trifle below his knees.
. He proved polite and self-possessed, but
nof cordiaL Upon hearing that Bessla
was the queen of the expedition and that
her territories were peopled with white
men and women and extended beyond the
sea he treated her with Increased respect
end refused to address anybody else.
The Interpreter, a Zanzibar!, turned the
monarch's speeches Into Swahlll, and Lord
Wlnstone then translated them Into Eng
lish for Bessie's benefit, while her re
marks were translated Into Swahili by his
Lordship and then Into Mapora for the
ear of Kanatto. Thus Lord Wlnstone
was In a position to say much that he
pleased, for the interpreter knew no Eng
lish.
An agreement was quickly come to and
twenty days' rations were promised by
Kanatto on reasonable though not gener
ous terms. He furnished millet, sweet pota
toes and some hundreds of heads of ex
tremely large plantains. He spoke with
reverence of the Elephant Spirit, and In
vited Queen Bessie and her white medi
cine men to be present at the ceremony of
slaying the giant eft.
This proposal was agreed to with sim
ulated gratification and Lord Winstone,
in his character of the mighty hunter who
had seen and spoken with the green deity
of the forest, received very great honor,
both from Kanatto and his medicine men.
Two nights â¢ before the expedition pro
ceeded the wretched eft was duly slain
while a young moon shone like a silver
sickle In the sky. Then the Soudanese
fired a volley and the ceremony concluded
with a war dance, which Bessie and her
followers .witnessed and duly admired.
Asked if her own fighting men could
have equaled this display, she hesitated,
then admitted the superiority of the Ma
pora, but Lord Wlnstone translated to
different purpose, knowing well that noth
ing more Impolitlo than to acknowledge
a savage's superior skill, craft, wealth,
beauty or honor.

Presently she swam toward the dock
and Morris saw her climb the slippery
stairs and run lightly up to the bath
house.
Twenty minutes later he found hit com

with her hair down drying it In the sun.
Morris ctlll wore the disreputable
trousers, but his white sweater was pass
ably clean, and he wore golf stockings
and yachting shoes. It was noticeable
that he had Just had a remarkably clean
shave. He was meaning to take a little
sail before breakfast.
Morris was in time to see her throw
her bare arms above her head, spring
lightly upward and descend in a straight
limbed dive into the rippling water.
"Great Scott!" he remarked to himself,
"that was a corking dive, all right."
He waited until she appeared on the
surface, swimming on her side, and then,
with a run and a leap, was after her.
She glanced back as she heard hi* splash
and smiled as he came up blinking.
"Good morning." she called.

She turned over on her back and float

The tide was high, the air filled with
the sweetness of honeysuckle and musical
with the call of birds. A girl in a red
bathing suit stood at the end of the dock
in the early sunlight.
Accordingly, when Holbrook and Sea

rocks. Holbrook and Seaton marched off
up to the house, carrying dress suit cases,
and Morris saw them no more that night.
He cooked his solitary supper, *moked

Solomon P. F,ogy was the gentleman's
name; If you hadn't known It you could
probably have guessed It on the- first
trial. In his old age this highly respect
able person was all that any could have
v/ished, and a whole let more than some
people liked, but we deeply regret to state
that when he was younger ho was not
only a boy but also one of the boys,
which, is a very different proposition.
They treasure his memory >*et In the llt
tlo old town where he was wont to Infect

they bring it out to aswist the village

fidently expected that he would be hanged'
before he was. 30 years old, and the life
insurance company that would have con
sidered him a desirable risk would' have
ccnvlcted Itself in the eyes of the popu
lace of imbecility in- the first degree.
However, it fell out In the course of
time and inhuman events of one sort and
another 'that Solomon contracted a case
of chronic matrimony and put, all his
other evil ways far behind him. , Some
men take the Keeley cure and aome try
matrimony; It all depends on the temper
amentâand the wife. In fact, some try
matrimony first and the Keeley cure af
terward. As a" result of Mr. Fogy's mat

soon appeared on the scene. This event

and set up in business as general guide,
counselor and friend of the young and
erring. There Is nothing that so quali
fies a man to point out the way of life
to the perishing as to have perished a
little himself in his youth. Thus it waa
that Solomon Sr. exchanged the spirituous
for the spiritual and became in his declin
ing years â declining because that was
what he always did now whenever he
met any of his old but unregenerate
friendsâ a pillar of the church and one of
the principal props of an otherwise lop
sided social system.
As young Solomon grew to manhood h*
began to display tendencies that filled
his father's heart with sorrow, mixed with
anger. He had never been allowed to
mingle in any social gathering more ex
citing than the giddy whirl of the straw
berry festival at the Methodist church
or to Indulge in any beverage more stim
ulating than the common .or garden birch
beer. Yet, In spite of his father's fre
quent injunctions to associate only with
people who could do him good, he be
gan to be found in the company of dis
solute youths who foregathered with
strong drink when It was raging and could
look a full house in the face without bat
ting an eye. When his father remon
strated with him for his* waywardness he
replied that he was obeying the paternal
injunction to bo found only with those
who could do him good. The ambiguous
nature of this exceeding soft answer was
not revealed to the stern parent until he
discovered the exact extent to which his
offspring had been done. |
It happened that about the time that
the injured father was seriously contem
plating the advisability of severing dip
lomatic relations with his erring offspring
the said injured father paid a visit to
the town of his birth. It will be remem

"Want to come?" said Morris suddenly
to the girl on the dock.
"Oh, may I? Do you really want me?
she cried. .
"Sure!" said the laconic Morris.
Out they danced into the sparkle of
bright waves. The wind swept the girl's
hair from her face in a long shining
banner. She sang to herself, too happy
to talk. Occasionally her eyes met Billy's
as he 6at contentedly at the helm, and
were met by an answering smile. He liked
her silent good-fellowship. She didn't
.talk you to death the way most girls did.
Tie whistled an accompaniment to her
gay song.
"It is awfully good of you to take me
along like this," she said at last. "Espe
cially when I know your opinion of girls
as a race. The boys told us, what you
said when they' broke the news of our
arrival to you."
"Ohâ ohâ did they? I beg your pardon,"
stammered Morris.
"Oh, don't apologize, I understand how
you felt," said his companion laughing.
"We are in the way, I know."
"If girls were all like you I wouldn't
care how often I found them in my way,"
remarked Morris boldly.
"Was the fishing good yesterday?" she
inquired wickedly. "You seemed bo in
terested In it."
Morris blushed. "Oh, come now, don't
rub it In. I see what I missed all right."
"We were dreadfully hurt," she went
on In mock sadness. "We tried to think
it was unintentional, but the boys speed
ily set our minds at rest oft that score."
"You must have thought me a regular
boor. What can I do to prove to you
that I'm sorry?" Morris asked, waxing
tender In the sunlight of her mischievous
smile.
His companion was evidently practical.
"I know. Let me steer for a while," sho
said eagerly. .
"Why, sure!" he answered, and gave
his place at the helm, he, the self-elected
skipper, never known before to relinquish
the tiller to any human being. He showed
her how to steady thÂ© course over the
sunny soundy She was an apt pupil and
laughed gleefully as they met the waves.
Morris, watching her, resolved, that he
would breakfast at the big house if suf
ficiently urged. , *
When Seaton and Holbrook came down
to the dock some time later for their dip
they held their breath In astonishment at
beholding the sloop heeling over to the
breeze, a girl at the tiller, while the cyn
ical Billy sat beside her and dried her
hair with a Turkish towel. :
"Gee whiz!" exclaimed Holbrook, "will

an' play; with an' teach to fish, an' pad

and Krowed,, pretty as some flower put
down here in/a crevice, of the rocks. An' :
then one dayâ I mind. it wellâ I seed she
was a woman an* that I loved her. Thar
wasn't neve* no spring like that spring,
nor no day like that day..
"I didn't tell her so-4 was feared al
most to touch her. I was so rough an'
rude an' she so like; a flower, but I
thought on her a heap. It didn't make no
difference whar I was, layin' out on the
mountain side with only the stars for
roof, workin' in the shaft or settin' in my
shack listenin' to. the wind howling
through the timber an* the crackling of
the fire, Mary was everywhar. She was
In the first star that came shining out at
night, in the first flowers that sprung up
In the bottom lands. The voice of the
river In the shallow places was like her
laughter."
The old man pointed a sinewy finger
down toward a clump of trees below us.
"It was thar on' that point, with the
river on one side and the lake on the
other, that I built my house, setting up
here of an evening. It was to be- a real
houseâ not a log shackâ an' vines all over
it, an' a garden. Many a night I've built
that house, an* lived in it, an' watched
Mary rockin' the cradle.. I used to travel,
too, them nights, me an' Mary, to the
East an' far off kentrles what she'd read
about. ' i
"Jim ueed to wonder why I left 'him an'
come out here by myself, but It was be
cause I wanted to be alone an' think
about It all. I never told him nothln' of
how I felt.
"An 1 then one evening I went down to
Mary's house for to tell her. It were
gettin' dark, as It might be this very
'evening. I landed quiet an' came up the
path, an' then I knowed what I might
have knowed all along, for Jim" an' Mary
was settin' lookln' jit the sunsetâ an' each
. otherâ an' I knowed they loved each
other an 1 that was nigh ten years ngo.
"I had forgot that I was old an' rough,
an' she was young, an" that it was as
natural for her to love Jim as flowers to
love the sun, but I didn'f think of that
then. I was wild like as I paddled away
up the lake an' climbed the trail to the
shack an' sat thar In the dark cursin'
him. God forgive me.
"He come home by and by, did Jim.
I could hear him whistling way down the
mountain side as if he was happy. He
sat In the doorway, lookln' up at the stars
an' talkln' about the claim we had, an' If
the mine panned out, an* of the money
we'd get for our red cedar logs. An' then
he said, shy-like, as if 'twas something
wonderful, 'What do you think. Jack,'
says he, 'I'm going to bo married soonâ
toâ to Mary,' he says.
"It was after Jim had quit an' gone to
bed an' I roaming abroad through the
dark that I felt it. All night I tramped
through the timber, thlnkin' an' flghtin'
with the wild beast in me. I had loved
her first. Thar was plenty, other women
for him to be happy with. What right
had he. with his good looks and youth to
come between us â he, my pardner, to steal
the flqwer I had watched and tended.
"I was crazy that nightâ plumb crazy.
Along toward day I come down the moun
tain straight as a stream for the cabin,
an' with my, mind made up. I would kill
him whar he ' was. He should never have
Maryâ a p for me, I warn't thlnkin' about
myself. I went into the shack an' found
my hunting knife. Jim was lyin' in â¢ his
bunk, the faint light from the window on
his face, an' he was smIllnV:-.Once I tried
to send the knife : down an' failed, an'
â¢â¢twice I tried, but again the strength in
my arm seemed to give out. I stood thar
lookln' down at him, an' then I flung the
knife away, an' came out here an' watched
the dawn come up over the mountains an'
the mist roll offer the lake, an' thought of
all that Jim had been to meâ an" of Mary.
It was natural she should love him an'
not me. Me! I was right old enough to
be her father, let alon* bein* rough and
Ill-favored. As ; for Jimâ how was he to
know that I cared, or if he. did know, he
couldn't help lovin' whar nature told him
to. Like to like. Youth to youth, who
could help lovin' Â¦ Jimâ or Mary. .
"I wrastled it out here with the sun

At last I seen how foolish I had been, an'
"After little Mary diedâ so pretty, so
tinyâ I brung her here in my arms, an'
laid here tharâ Mary cryin' beside me â
an' now I love to come here an' set after
the day's work is done. No, I couldn't
go East. I couldn't leave her," he said
simply.
The blush had died from the sky. The
crests of the mountains shone out cold
and white. The night had come â but it
was a night radiant with the light of
myriads of stars.

"They was married an' lived here for a

"That will bring her.V he exu.ied to
himself.
"But I thought your children wer*
grown?"
"They're over twenty," he admitted
boldly, "but that Is the very age at which
young people most need the controlling
Influence of home."
He could see that she was weakening,
and he wisely refrained from further per
suasion, murmuring only, "We need you,
dear."
On the steps of her new home, as the
carriage dashed up the drive, she noticed
that a small group awaited them. A mo
ment later she was clasped in a bear
hug by a bright faced girl, who said,
"My dear little new mother," so warmly
that she loved her on the spot, as well
as the manly youth who laughingly took
her next, pleading, "Me, too."
"And this Is my husband. Ralph," the
girl explaintd as another young man step
ped forward. "And this, Janet, Harry's
wife." ..
Then a nurse moved forward into the
circle, holding a bulky armful.
"And this, mother,", continued the girl
proudly, "Is your little granddaughter."
. So these were the "children" who need
ed her.
â¢ The second Mrs. Mallory swept the
group with an eye that sought her per
fidious husband. He had disappeared.
Then aha burled her convulsed face in
the soft, sweet smelling bundle contain
ing her new grandchild to smother her
laughter.
With a business-like air that sat amus
ingly on her she showed him the rooms
that she and her mother rented to eke
out their small and uncertain Income, and
the next day found him Installed In them.
Often during the following months he
would spend an hour with the mother
end daughter, noting with hidden amuse
ment the latter's unnatural little air of
el dirtiness. She would forget and laugh
and chat gajly at times. Then, In a mo
ment, the seemed to remember that she
was nr> longer young, and ehe became
in a trice the prosaic, careworn woman
tea in, drawing her mantle of years un-
Fif.cicuely about her. It was as if she
had determined not to be surprised by
o!<1 age. and eo had rushed out to meet It.
His speculative glance now told him
that shÂ« could not be more than 40, If
she were that. But by the way In wi*ich
she was always putting forward the
young girls of her acquaintance it waa
evident that she thought herself too old
a woman to be of interest to any man.
"She belonps to the old regime," Mal
lory soliloquized, "and has probably con
sidered herself an old lady ever since she
emerged from her teens. She hasn't been
able to assimilate this bachelor-woman
idea." and he smiled to himself.
"By the way. Miss Marion," he said
nonchalantly, "I ha%*e tickets for the
opera to-morrow night. Be good and
come, too." â¢
There was a flash of surprise in her
face that fcr one brief, fleeting moment
raid frankly that he must have taken
leave of his tenses. Then courtesy pre
vailed, and after hesitating for an ap
preciable moment, in which it was ap
parent that she was casting about in her
mind for Fcrr.e plausible excuse, she ac

laughing comment. All this Mallory di
vined and he put forth every effort to
make her forgpt herself to such good pur
pore that by the end of the evening she
was laughing and chatting as unconcern
edly as if Mrs. Grundy did not exist.
With this excellent beginning things
In the midst of his reverie Miss Foster
appeared, her delicate sttghtness height
ened by the massive doorway In which
che etood framed for a moment As he
ro6e to greet her he wondered Idly what
could have given her that harassed lookâ
this little woman with the oval face and
the piled up hair. Her smile, he thought,
was oddly shy and girlish, and In a few
minutes they were talking with the ease

pointsâ th* advantages and th* disadvan

b*twe*n bis lips, he would consider all
ave.ila.ble methods of securing th* thing
desired.
He wu a handsome, vigorous man of CO
years when business affairs making It
necessary for him to spend a number of
months In New York a letter of Introduc
tion secured him the very delightful privi
lege of rooms with the Fosters, whose
story cf waning fortune* he had heard
from the friend who sent him to them.
The ominous length of his upper lip was
hidden under a short, gray mustache, or
Miss Foster would have known from the
first that It was useless to oppose him
once his mind was set upon anything.
The romance of his youth was a beauti
ful memoryâ a thing as faint and elusive
as the scent of lavender. But he had been
loyal to It for twenty years, having been
left at 20 a widower with two children.
As he sat in the great dim drawing-room,
â¢v her* everything vu eloquent of other
Cays, awaiting* Miss Foster's appearance,
he noticed several thingsâ touches unusual
In stiff city drawing-rooms, but which
made for homeness. He sighed with a
pudden wlstfulnees altogether out of keep,
ing with his height, breadtb and florid
ness.
She held out* both hands to Allyn
Hardln. and as his own closed over hers
a sudden picture flashed before her. She
heard again those peals of childish laugh
ter, saw again a man's head bend swiftly
down, like a great boy's, beneath the tug
of baby's hands: saw a face, habitually
cold, alight with something divinely warm
as It had looked at her across the sunny
head of little Alice, from the narrow
doorway of a fast receding train. Her
heart gave a bound that frightened her.
and, drawing her hands away, she turned
and -looked again upon the ntoonlit
water.
"I was called home unexpectedly on
business," Allyn was explaining, when he
noted that she was not listening.
He stepped nearer to her side.
"Miss Ellison." he began, then he saw
how the moonlight was caught and shim
mered In the tears that lay on her cheek,
and which she could not help any more
than she could have told the reason why
they fell.
"What's th* matter, Alice?"
There was a long pause, and when she
answered her voice was like a tired
child's.
"Nothing. Only I'm so tired."
She had turned and. Involuntarily,
stretched forth her hands again, but
Allyn's hands slipped past her's, and htÂ»
folded her in his arms.
"Oh, Alice," he murmured; "Alice, you
don't know how I love you."
She raised her wet face to his, and as
he bent low over her the weight slipped
from her heart, and the old life, that had
so tired her, became a thing of the past.
"Whyâ whyâ where did you come
from?" Her voice trembled, but she did
not care.
Alice turned about quickly.
"Oh!" she gasped. "I thought you .were
in Wisconsin." She moved tow f rd â¢Â«
train not losing hold of the little hand
that lay In hers. jCr'Vi ~~Â«
"I could not get off. Wish I had known
you were aboard"â the train was moving.
"Good-by. good-by." .
"Bon voyage!" called Alice. ThÂ«n bend-
Ing toward the child, "Wave by-by to

and Alice, raising her head, looked up at
Allyn. Thev both laughed.
On the rest of that north-bound trip
all that Allyn saw was a little country
railroad xtatlon. with Its usual motly
setting. Standing forth from it all were
the same two figures, the Madonna and
the childâ one in gown of soitly clinging
blue, the other in ruffled white apron.
The two weeks* visit to her brother
came to an end. and the train was fast
drawng Alice Ellison away from the sweet
peace of the country into the rush and
whirl of that old life In the city. Leaning
back in her chair, dreamily looking out
of the window, she came to the conclu
sion that she was tired of herself.
She sighed and rose wearily. Swaying
with the motion of the car, she made her
way toward the Pullmans. It was Octo
ber: perhaps she might find some of her
friends returning to the city. Pausing a
moment on the threshold of the sleeper,
she looked down the red-plush aisle. *
A few feet in front of her a man was
seated, with his back turned toward her.
He had light hair, "Just like Mr. Har
dln's." and standing on the seat beside
him was a little child. The car lurched,
and the little fellow swayed, only to be
caught by a strong arm that threw him
downward; then the man's head darted
down and Alice smiled at the screams ot
childish laughter.
She watched them for a moment, then
the child, peering over the man's shoul
der, called out. "Pretty lady, pretty
lady!" and she, feeling too weary to more
than smile at the little fellow, turned to
go back to her uninteresting book.
The train was crossing the long bridge
over Lake Ponchaxtrain. and Alice paused
in the vestibule between the Pullman and
the chair car. Standing at the window
she looked out upon the, vastness of the
moonlit lake and sky and felt very tired
and small and useless. She was not blue,
nor was she morbid: but, somehow, her
heart rebelled at going back to that old
life In the city, so empty, so shallow, soâ
"Alice! Miss Ellisonâ"
Ing off with a young man and woman
who had loined her.
"Miss Ellison! How do you do?
As before, he divined the meaning of it
all. Some idle word that had aroused all
her dormant sensitiveness, and she was
writhing under It. She doubtless Imag
ined that people were saying that that old
maid. Marion Poster, li trying to catch
Mr. Mallory, and her manner was her
fierce, wordless refutation of it. The line*
of care were deepening in her face day
by day, and his heart ached for her.
"I want to speak to you, Miss Foster,"
he said In a determined way, as she was
about to pass htm In the hall one day
with her usual brief greeting.
"Certainly," she replied somewhat.un
comfortably, and they sat down la the
quiet drawing-room together.
"Something is bothering you," he began,
fixing his glance searchingly upon her.
"Come now, be frank. If there Is -any
way in which I can be of service to you,
tell me."
"It's nothing," she protested hastily,
"or, at least, nothing much." Then with
an attempt at lightness 'she added,
"Women who have neither fathers nor
brothers to look out for them often have
to worry, you know." . -
Another sort of woman might have
said "husbands," but to Miss Foster,
whose consciousness upon the subjects of
love and matrimony was as shrinking as
that of a young girl, such a remark
would have b**n Impossible. Even In that
moment Mallory chuckled to himself, yet
would have liked to take her in his arms
and put himself between her and the
world forever.
"Marry me," he said softly. "Give me
the right to take care of you. I should
count it a great happiness."
Her face went scarlet.
"Such a subject seems scarcely the
proper one for Jest," she retorted with
dignity. "If you will excuse me, I have
duties to attend to," and she rose to
leave him.
"One moment."
His voice rang a trifle sharp and clear
with command. The Mallory who achieved
Â¦what he wanted in life was speaking.
Miss Foster seemed to feel this, and she
Â¦at down again as obediently as a child,
though he could see that her hands were
quivering nervously.
"You have misunderstood me," he aald
In a calm, decided voice, which somehow
thrilled her with the certainty that he
would bend her to his will.
"I have no Intention of indulging In the

and theaters followed and apparently
Miss Foster's fear of appearing "kitten
ish" slumbered. To Mallory each hour
ipeat la her society' made htm long for
more. She was so dellclously contradic
tory.
Then, of a sudden, all the old, prim re
straint returned to her manner. Three
consecutive Invitations were refused with
excuse* so flimsy that even the most ob
tuse person znuit have seen through
them.
her. and her heart grew tender. And then
something- would crop up like weeds in
the parable, choking out these tiny seeds
of love. And that something was piti
fully like the vision that had but Just
.caused her a momentary gladness. But
the clear blue eyes were so cold, the fine
mouth so firmly set with determination,
the chin so square that she would rise
impatiently, crying out:
"Ah, no, he would never be tender, nor
sweet, norâ norâ " â¢
For she, too, had her picture of what a
home should be. and while she scarcely
dared dwell' on it, as he could do. It waa
there, in the clouds above her head. A
home in which there waa a woman whose
life's one aim was to keep the tired lines
from her husband's face, the worrying
cares from his heart, to maintain forever
.the smiles on those little upturned faces
at her knee. But the husband must be
one with a heart warm enough to take
and profit- by the sympathy she held out
to him In such good abundance, a man
who could understand the hearts of thoso
little children, in the arms of that woman.
So, thinking much but understanding
little of each other, they went their sepa
rate ways, until one morning early, when
a train drew out from the depot, Alice
seated In the chair-car, Allyn swinging
on to the step of 4he last coach. ,
He was off on his vacation, and in the
curlings of the smoke he saw not the ta.ee
of Alice Ellison, but cool, green nooks
by running streams.. He heard the crunch
of thn dried leaves beneath his feet, and
felt the tugging of the trout upon his
line. â¢ .
He had bid Alice good-by two evenings
before, expecting to leave the city then,
and he recalled* her look of good, frank
friendship, as she had put her hand in
his. "What a pity there is not more to
her," he mused; "she Is so attractive, but
Â¦he lacks weight.""
The. train was coming to a stop, and
Allyn rose and went out on the platform.
They were slowing into a picturesque lit
tle town, with green trees In sight of the
depot, and big, sprawly southern homes,
white and green in the sunlight.
Was that Alice?
Yes, there on the lower step of the
coach ahead of him she stood, with an
impatience barely hidden by her quiet
manner, waiting for the train to stop.
She was smiling, oh, so brightly, and
the train had scarcely come to a stand
still before she had sprung down and was
running across the platform to meetâ
Allyn Hardin could not believe his own
eyes.
A little girl, with brown legs flashing
bare above low socks, and face, left bare
by the bonnet that hung about her neck,
reflecting the brightness he had seen on
Alice's, came rushing down the platform,
too. With a shriek "of Joy, she threw her
self into AUce's open arms.
The whistle blew again. Alice was movl
"My dear Miss Foster," he said per
suasively, "we won't talk of that phase
of the matter at all. I should not be say
ing this to you if I had not a very deep
regard for you â and you, I fancy, would
not be listening."
There waa a little Incoherent murmur
which ho took for absent. Then he con
tinued with an anxious air:
"But there is an ethical side to the mat
ter that persons of our age should con
sider. You would be doing a beautiful
act if you would take my children and
me in hand, and I could make things so
Mallory could have roared with laugh
ter at the Innocent "only." As he had
supposed, then, it was not that she really
thought herself outside the paleâ it was
only that of one sensitively afraid
that she ought to think so. He could not
entirely banish the teasing smile from his
eyes, and she felt vaguely that she had
walked into the trap he had set for her.
"But, of course, lt'a absurd for you to
say such things to a woman of my age â
and for me to listen," she continued cour
ageously, though Mallory noticed that she
no longer made as if to leave him.
sentimental talk of a man of 25," he went
on, taking one of her slim hands in his
and looking at her a bit quizzically.
"Love, of course, Is a matter of year*. A
man and woman of 60 would only be
ridiculous If they essayed to speak that
language."
"But I'm only 89!" she exclaimed, sur
prised into protest.

I months ago they combined tor aa
I era of accomplishment. Their rp-*
, dal object was a campaign of edu
cation in art. They took hold with such
vim .that next week tha association will
hold Its first convention and special pho
tographic exhibition at the Mechanics'
Pavilion to demonstrate the value and at
tractiveness of the new movement.
In point of fact it will be something:
more than a mere formal convention. It
will be a perfect art feast and general
Jollification combined. During the three
days that the association will be in con
clave there will be publio exhibitions and
concerts, a theater party, baseball game,
lectures on art, excursion on the bay and
a grand banquet. Indeed, on next Satur
day, the last day of the convention, San
Francisco will experience the novelty of
having every photograph gallery in the
>dty closed. For full twenty-four hours
t" even the most vain mortals among us will
have to suffer the hardship of not being
able to assume their moat fetching poses
before the camera. During all that time
not a bulb will be pressed, not a single
negative marred. For one day at least
the stentorious "Look pleasant, please,"
will be heard no more. This will be the
very first time that this phenomena has
.occurred in the history of art in the
West.
And all this to the end that the big
display, at 'the- Pavilion may receive the
attention that the photographers think
It deserves. And those well versed in art
from the standpoint of knowing just what
the great public likes declare that It will
be a rare exhibition indeed.
To begin with, the portrait work will be
given the place of honor, and it Is from
among this vast array that the photo

(JrMffiBiaff-AjSiiBaffa .- written about noth
ing: else for the past thirty years: Itf is
jtrue that a great many of my race^o
not agjee with me as to my solution of
the race question. The few leaders of
our race who are preachers and teach
ers or are settled in comfortable berth*
naturally say, "Stay: where you are."
But the negro demands a national
life. Why did the colonists leave
England? Because : they â¢ were op
pressed â they wanted freedom, nation
ality. The result ' is that they : have
built the greatest country in the
world.. The negroes can and must do
likewise. . If every : -negro in- America
were a teacher or a prcache^ there would
still be a shortage of preachers and
minions o i li errors in /\ tries,
I am not unmindful of the benefits derived by us from the white V-ce! " They are vast, inestimable.. We Â¦ have
learned work, a most important lesson, and we have been shown the graces-of civilization. But we have gone so far
and can go no farther, because there are laws and prejudices that hold us back in America. If we are to advance we
must set up our own government elsewhere. â- J . Â« . .-Â¦'.- r ; --.- â¢, : -
Of course I cannot approve the murders and lynchings which have taken place for the last thirty years. But
even aside from these conditions no sensible man can envy the negro his lot in America. I have- offered many
a white man from $100 to $500 a day to blacken their faces and undergo for a few days what the -negro docs all his
life â namely, to attempt to go to first-class hotels, restaurants and business places. and receive a* few of the insults
which it is the negro's lot to receive. So far I have found no white man willing to take the jab.-
And here's another illustration: A prominent Senator, whose name I do not care to mention, said to me a
few years ago in Washington: â¢. Â¦Â¦'.' . r v "- -
"Turner, your ideas about emigration arc all wrong. The negroes ought to stay among us and work.. America
is the place for them." After a pause the Senator added. with a smile: "This, of course, - is ; the .'white .man's
opinion â the question as looked at from the white man's side, for we really /want and. need you"_here.:' Your work
is cheap and when the boss curses you you simply smile. A; foreign laborer, would probably face about and fight.
Yes. as a white man I think the nigger ought to stay in America, but if I were one I'd get out of America before
6undown." Â¦ \ \> Â¦, y~Â»r ':
These are a few of the reasons why negroes should go to Africa. Now 1 what | does; Africa offer? I >was for
eight years a missionary to that so-called dark country. It is immense in its resources and has climates to suit every
temperament. Its soil is adapted to every, form of agriculture. There are now 37,000 civilized negroes in Liberia.
No white men are there except a few who have married negro women! A, negro is President of the republic and
there is a full Senate and House of Representatives and Cabinet officials. The lands sell from 5 cents to $10 an acre
and all products except wheat grows abundantly. It is the ideal country for a negroâ a 1 country which offers nat
ural resources and liberty to develop them. -
American negroes are steadily going there â from three to ten necrocs a week are leaving the ports of New York,
Boston and Baltimore. In 1878 a shipload was sent from Charleston, and three years ago two others were sent by
the Liberian Colonial Association of Birmingham. So far as -I know, none of these cqjjpnists have evinced a desire
to return.
The Colored National Emigration and Commercial Association, of which 1 am treasurer, has already raised
$26,000 for emigration purposes. When we have raised $100,000 we shall buy a ship, which will ply between Amer
ica and Africa, carrying on its trip to Africa colored emigrants, and, on its return bringing back African products
to be sold in America. In this way the enterprise will prove a money-making investment, as well as a satisfactory
help toward the solution of the race problem. The work is, progressing slowly, but, I think, steadily and surely. We
meet obstacles, of course â some of our colored brothers say they will patronize our ship when x it is built, but are
unwilling to contribute to the building of it.
Booker Washington and I do not agree, but whenever I go to his town he tells me to speak to the people
in Â«ny own way. He is a man of great conservatism and good sense, though he has made enemies among the
Boston and Chicago element of the negroes. He has done a big work in Tuskegee.
But, to repeat myself. I believe the future of the negro race lies in independence. Therefore I agree with the
speech made by John Temple Graves at Chautauqua, N. Y. The races must be separated. â¢'- It is also my belief that
Providence sent slaves to America that the negro might learn the value of work and become imbued with civiliza
tion; returning later to Africa to save the millions of their savage brethren. The time for. the return has come. The
negro demands national life. He is at last prepared for it, but will never have it so long as he stays in America.

UsJr^^Â°ESsa the group of the La
drones, known as Tinian, the others
being Farallon de Pajaros, Assump
tion, Agugan, Pajan, Alamagan and
Gugan. This island, which is inhab

the Philippines very: many years ago, is;
known' to every whaler as- a place
where fresh provisions can be ' obtained^
and there - is a Â¦ good * supply; of . witer ;
there. Beyond , these facts, but; little : is
known by the civilized nation's, about
the island. Whalers' as â¢a; rule are; not
explorers or. discbyerers, : and they. have
never taken. the trouble, to see Twhat
there was on island/, except that
there was that which theyTrieeded. ..On
one of my whaling trips; I dropped 'an- , , , . : ,, . --_-.,,..
chor off the northwest side of "the island /â¢ ' / :'Â¦Â¦: ' ,*â¢ â¢'Â¦; ?'â¢â¢ ' . . Â¦Â¦ Â¦-J : ,^ '',-; V , *
to get fresh 'supplies' and 'decided: to go\ashore and have a chat with the natives and to learn the lay of the land. . I
landed in a small, shelving cove to the right of which there is a small village of thatched huts, the Governor's house,
a little more pretentious as* to> size,' but of- the bamboo and straw construction, and beyond that the village church,
standing on what I : call, stilts.^ After haying had, a pleasant chat with the Governor, a descendant of old Spain, I
started on a tourof I examinatio*n of : the island for exercise and pleasure. It" was while on that tour that I made a
discovery on a plateau about half a-'mile from the village of something that I never expected to find and which I
have never been, able to learn anything about/ v.; ' ;-?'â¢-
What I-discovered were twelve stone. monoliths, four of which are still standing. The pillars are of uniform
shape and size^being twelve feet in height, with one face six feet in width and the other four feet. Those that are
standing rest on a circular stone ; disc, one ; foot in thickness and eight feet in diameter or twenty-four feet in circum
ference In each" of the discs, fromnvhich the pillars have fallen, whether from ..the effects of earthquakes or other
causes I cannot say, there is an 'eight-inch square opening, evidently cut to receive a dowel to keep each pillar
m . "Â¦These twelve -'pillars' had been erected in the form of a parallelogram at equal distances apart, they occupying
along the sides a distanced sixty feet and being thirty feet apart atthe widest On the top of those that arc stand
ine there is an immense "stone vase : in- the shape of a tea-cup. These vases are eight feet in height and ten feet in
diameter at the top'i Each is hollowed out and there is evidence to prove that they were filled. with earth and that in
them grew shrubs aikl trees that'attained a height of twenty feet -^ tii&t-
Â¦*â¢ % The nioholiths.Â»-e black with age. but, when I chipped off several pieces from those that were dismantled I dis
covered that they are^ of sandstone. They, were cut with great accuracy and set up with precision in straight lines,
showing that whosoever" put. them up were masters of the mechanical arts and of applied mechanics. For let me
tell you the pillars;'weigh .no less than six! and a half tons and the vases four tons.
â¢ The stone isentirely different from any that there is on the island, which is limestone and granite, showing'
conclusively that they, were brought there/but wherefrom or by whom is what I have been trying to discover. There
is no such stone on any of the islands. of the Ladrones group, nor is there any even at Guam. The island is fertile
and abounds in tropical fruit. . . *> Â¦; VV : ' t-- tu *u v -ij a
The natives are neither mechanics . nor artisans, as may be gathered from the style^of houses they build, and
thev themselves say that they are' not hewers of stone and that their ancestors were not None of the natives, not
even the Governor, could tell anything about these monoliths. All they could say was that they had always been
there because their fathers, grandfathers, great-grandfathers and great-great-grandfathers had all said so.
' I suggested that if one of 4he stones and vases with the disc were removed to some civilized center possibly
something could be learned about them. The Governor told me that I could have them all if I wpuld only take
them away as that would give so much more for cultivation. They are in the way and the natives do not know
how to move them. The natives also say that there is no legend about them. The "people of Guam heard of these
monoliths but could not 'tell anything about them and did not seem to care to interest themselves in the matter.
"i That the stones were cut by professional hewers of stone there can , be no doubt, but who cut
them who transported them to an island wheTe there is at this time no evidence of an advanced civilization, and
what'was the purpose of bringing them to the island and taking them half a mile inland and erecting them where some
still stand are questions that suggested themselves to me, but I received no more satisfaction than has been accord
ed to those who asked who it was that built the Pyramids of Egypt. . â¢ . .â¢ . . -.
They certainly arenot the Tuins of a Druidic temple, for all such were circular m form, and there is nothing
visible in the shape of sacrificial altars, nor is there anything to show thaftherc ever was a city or town on the island
that might, have been inhabited by modern civilized people.
MANAGIG SMALL CHILDREN BY ARTIFICE
*SiktH Talk by Wm. J. Shearer, A.^l. Ph. D.^
T"J>-j| ANY mothers, and not a few fathers, endeavor to manage
iT^G^^iicr their children by aid of tricks, and by other means which
' mm\^/r\v will enable them to avoid direct conflicts with their chil-
J"' llwtv/^Mr 1 dren. In this way they hope to secure compliance with
* '^ U$sc\U& l^ c ' r vv ' s^ es w^hout unpleasantness.
S^ i^^ffljâ¢^i I l^ cy avc decided lo BO out and leave one or more
of the children -at home they will sometimes send to a dif
ferent room those to be left, behind. Sometimes they will tell de
liberate untruths as to where they are (going. At other times they
may pretend to be going one place and fully intend to go to another. The
parents who make use of such methods should not expect to, be held in : re
â¢pect by their children. Not only .will a child soon learri to look with positive
distrust upon everything the parent says or. does, but the disappointment
will be so much increased that it will scarcely ever be forgotten.
Worse than all, the children will be trained in habits of - deceit and
falsehood, so that irreparable injury will be done. Parents . who have used
such means in the management of their children will acknowledge that -not
only did the children soon discover the deceit, but also that^in a short time
they become more successful than their parents in reaching desired ends by
means of artifices, if not by positive falsehoods.
Management by Reason.
Other parents regularly rely upon managing their children by giving rea
sons for their actions. Before these parents have gone far they discover
that they have little time for anything else. The children will soon insist
upon having explanations at every point. Very soon the parents discover
that such a method of management is as impracticable as the method by
artifice. The probability is that, becoming thoroughly disgusted with them
selves and this method, they will suddenly change to some more stren
uous plan. There are times when reasons may and should be given; but,
without doubt, it is a great mistake for parents to give children grounds for
expecting reasons whenever they see fit to insist upon them.
As before stated, others will object because they wish to govern the
children by reason. Such are unmindful of the fact that judgment is de
pendent upon other faculties, and is therefore the last to develop. It is
generally acknowledged that a child 10 years old may have strength enough
to earn a living, but the law does not consider his reason sufficiently devel
oped to trust him to himself until he is 21 years old. Not only is it a duty
of a parent to support a child until he can support himself, but it is equally
binding upon the parent to give a child the benefit of the parent's mature
judgment. To expect a young child to provide nourishment for himself is
just as reasonable as to think that he should furnish Â¦ reason for his own
guidance and direction.
The question which naturally arises in the mind of every thoughtful pa-
rent is, ''.When shall I give reasons?" This is not an easy question to
answer.
* , As before stated, there are times when reasons should be given. There
are other times when reasons should not be given. It is very doubtful if a
reason should be, given to a young child when the question of obedience is
pending, if offered as an inducement to procure obedience. After the child
has done as requested is a good time to call' the child and explain why some
thing was insisted upon. If done in the proper spirit it will make matters
much more satisfactory in the future. Again, it may sometimes be found
best to give reasons to an older child of strong will for the purpose of help
ing the child to come to a correct decision concerning something which
has been left to the child to decide. No young child should ever feel that
he has a right to demand arcason of a parent. . â¢
Management by - Harshness. ,
Most of us know that the parent who strives to manage a child by tricks
or simply by reason will soon find these methods altogether unsatisfactory.
Unkindness, scolding, harshness, threats, injudicious punishments and, other
ill-considered methods will soon take the place of government by artifice
and reason. That these last mentioned methods are used by many all must
admit. That they are not proper none wiUdenv.
Those who have endeavored to manage their children by any of the
methods mentioned will need no. argument to convince. them that they have
made a mistake. Happy the parent who, before it ' is. too late, realizes the
fact that the only parental government which is worthy of the name is that
founded upon absolute, unquestioned authority. In the training of children
the first duty of the parent is the establishment of authority over .them.
Very early each child should discover the absolute necessity of obeying the
wish of the parent. Very early the habit of complying with the parent's de
mands should be firmly fixed.
"Some will object because they wish to .use nothing but gentle means with
their children. Their intentions are good. The great effort of all parents
should be to manage their children by such measures. However, parents
will soon find that it is impossible to manage children by gentle means un
less they first secure absolute authority over their children. Let this be se
cured and_there need be no trouble thereafter. Thus alone can they ever
realize their desire to secure the desired end by gentle measures. l
.'â¢â¢ . Others object to governing by absolute authority because of the belief
that 4hus the parent may lose the child's love. Above all things parents do )
and should desire to forever keep the warm love of their children. The love
which aTnild feels toward a parent will depend, in great measure, upon" the
sympathy shown in their joys and sorrows, v This Jove will not only not be
lost, but \t will most certainly be more firmly established by" the 5 exercise of
a kind, just, absolute authority. What person can remember a case of .a
child's caring more for a parent who permitted him to do as he pleased than
he did for the parent who. in all kindness, but with much firmness, required
him to comply implicitly with his directions? j
Many parents who read upon this subject may express doubt as to the
truth of the statement that if taken in time most of, the very worst children
could have been managed auite easily. It seems hardly possible to them that
a child possessing an unusually great supply of nervous energy, sometimes
of a very troublesome disposition, at other times very stubborn, and once
in a while showing signs of absolute insubordination, could ever have been
reached by any but the harshest methods of management. However, there
is but little if any doubt that the most gentle measures would have proven
perfectly satisfactory had they been tried in time, and followed with firmness
and perseverance.
If proper care is taken during the first years there will be no, cause to
worry about the rest. If this time is lost it" will be refrained only with dif
ficulty. After these years the parent will need to be the lighthouse to guide
away from hidden dangers. . z ;â¢'
Children JD espise Their Parents.
The parent who fails to govern his child is apt not only to lose the child's
Jove, but also to teach the child to despise him. it is, yet too true, that
' in a very short time children will. understand the weakness of; a parent, and
utterly despise the one who cannot manage even a child. As such children
grow older they will grow unmanageable, and will hold in supreme con
tempt a loving parent who has sacrificed parental authority in the hope of
winning the child's love.
In later years, when, perha'ps, the mother has gone from them, children
will begin to feel ".gratitude for. her self-sacrificing love, and contempt will
turn to pity. Then they may say, "Poor mother; she tried to manage us,
but she was too kind." Let it not be' forgotten that the parent who fails to
-govern a child loses the child's respect, wins his contempt when young, and
its pity when older. Since this is so. surely no parent should hesitate to
strive to bring his child under absolute authority by gentle means.' if possible,
but. by some;mea*hs without fail. . J ' .
One great cause of trouble is that parents do not fully realize the impor
tance of beginning pearly enough. They say they do not wish to interfere,
with the child's" freedom. They say they wish it to be perfectly natural.
They are probably unmindful of the fact that the child naturally passes
""through the severaljistasres of civilization thfjSugh which the race has passed.
Left to himself he would probably take several ages for his passage through
the savage,' half-civilized and enlightened stages. Because of the influence of
parents and,others heis expected to pass quite rapidly through the first
* stages. Parents should appreciate the importance of beginning early, in or
der that they may help the child to almost entirely skip the first two stages.
Too often the^child is permitted to do just as he pleases for months or
even'years.. Though childhood is the time. for freedom, under some circum
stances, it is of all times the one time. when training. can be made most ef
fective.^ This being the case, parents should appreciate the importance of
beginning at the beginning. ,

ten years the Irishman's Junior, with his

According to the electrician's story as
told to Mr. Fitch, the explosion melted
out all the fuses throughout the building.
wHlch had to be entirely rewired. The
man who tells this remarkable story firm
ly believes in the great electrical resist
ance of the mineral. â¢ ?''--'iÂ«.
A most remarkable feature of this min
eral, so new and strange to science is
that after putting It through hydrofluoric
Since beginning his experiments Mr
Fitch is of the opinion trat the unknown

great use in the' field of electricity, but
on this point opinions differ. Mr. Fitci.
gave some of it to a man in Chicago who
thought he would like to see what the
stuff was good for In the electrical line.
He thought it would make a good storage
battery, and accordingly ho ground up the
ore end after putting it thiough nltio
muriatic acid washed the residuum and
filled a little U-shaped electrhal lamp,
which he had made expressly for the ex
periment. Having exhausted the air from
this. hÂ« screwed it on to an electric wire
in the place of the electric bulb light In
his room. Simultaneously with the turn
ing on of the current there was an ex
plosion like that of a pistol, and -what
seemed like a grotesque flame flew in tlie
experimenter's face. Not a j.lece of the
lamp was to be found.
Aside from its many other qualities. Mr.
Fitch is assured that there will be great
profit found In extracting many of these
metals from this strange compound. So
many tire they that the only way to ex
tract them would be to do so by chemical
processes, and Mr. Fitch has already hid
a proposition from wealthy capitalists to
put up big chemical works to handle the
ore.

making a rotary motion on the powder
with the bottom of an ordinary glass- or
tumbler a circle of flashing light followed
Â¦every motion. Putting a piece of the
mineral under water and scratching it
with a penknife produced the same bril
liancy. . â
A few days afterward Mr. Fitch took a
quantity of the eerie stuff to E. B. Pres
ton, mineralogist at the State Mining Bu
reau, for analysis. From 'this analysis It
was found that the mineral contains
among its constituents gold, silver, cop
per, antimony, sulphur, zinc, manganese,
bismuth, cadmium, arsenic, iron, alu
minum and resolves into an unknown
precipitate, which possesses the power of
emitting light In the same marked degree
as before the extraction of these many
other elements. According to Selby's fire
assay the mineral goes from $30 to $80 in
gold to the ton and contains 20 per cent of
zinc.

Since the discovery of this, mineral,
which much resembles black oxide of
.v>Â£per when first taken from the mine
and later turning to a dull gray, the
theories that have flown about concerning
It have been enough to set the most ac
tive statistician in a wild flurry. It has
bee-n said to contain radium. On this
theory as much as eighty or a hundred
thousand dollars a ton has been quoted
for it by the tongue or gossip. As
there is probably no one In this country
competent to extract the radium from
tht mineral, should It contain it. a quan
tity cf it was sent some weeks ago to
Franc* to pass through the Â»earching
hands cf Professor and Mme. Currie.
It was in last May that Mr. Fitch was
prospecting for copper near Webb's sta
tion. In Marlposa County, where he now
has 130 acres under bond. He was not
averse to finding gold or silver, though
now he thinks he has found a. mineral
more valuable than either, and also con
taining a large percentage of these pre
cious metals. Down the shaft, fifty feet
In depth, while making a crosscut of

strange black ore seven feet In width
that Is puzzling laymen and scientists
alike by Its strange performances. On
the banging ledge 1Â» a thirty-foot wall of
b!ue auartx. Over to what seems to be
the footwall the formation Is porphyry.
The ledge so far as uncovered extends
ISO feet or more in length, and for a
distance of eleven feet to the west of It
everything is very heavily mineralized so
far as uncovered. \x.'^l *â¢'
Mr Fitch took specimens of the ore to

Frank was surprised to see a zigzag trail
of light follow the knife. All lights were
extinguished In the office and the mineral
was subjected to other tests to make It
show off. Scratching it with the finger
nail or with a wooden toothpick produced
the tame trail of sparks-a fluorescence, if
it can be so termed, lacking only the
cuallty â¬f actual heat. Some of. the min
eral which is of moderate hardness, was
ground to a powder, and upon putting a
Professor Hayr.es of Heald's Buslneis
College, who has been very much inter
ested In the mineral, takes a different
view of it. He finds that the mineral
shows quite an effervescence under adds
and that one of tha alkalies lÂ» present In
Its makeup, but cannot yet determine
which one it is. He says It has been found
to be a good conductor of electricity, but
It has not been proved that It Is a natur
al storage battery, as claimed.
< Several other electricians and scientists
are working upon the mineral, and further
developments are expected as they go
deeper Into the matter: On top of all this
comes the record of the telephone com
pany, who have been making experiments
looking to find an electrical us* for the
mineral. They have made a test of thÂ«
stuff with a galvanometer with thÂ» wires
an inch apart and found an Insulation of
ten megohms, which proves conclusively
that the mineral can never be used as an
electrode for batteries. The orÂ» used in
these experiments was crushed to a fine
powder. In the opinion of the electrician
of the company the mineral can only bo
used as an Insulator.
Meantime the discoverer Is serene In the
belief that if nothing else develops ths
mineral contains enough of valuable and
precious metals to bring him a fortune
by extracting them. He also believes that
his find will yet prove to be something
more wonderful than zinc blend.
"It may be zino blend combined with
som<j copper-arsenio mineral found In
quartz. It shows no radium or radio act
ive qualities. It has the strong; reactive
qualities of zinc blend, and It has been
known for many years that zino ' blend
with quartz has the luminous Quality on
friction, which is present In this mineral.
If It contains radium It has In it the most
expensive thing In the world."
"As to the luminous Quality," said Pro
fessor Lewis. "Dana In bis mineralogy
mentions this Quality In slno blend. I
cannot see how the mineral could bo used
for storage battery purposes."
Professor Eakle, also of the untTertity,
in so far as he has looked into the matter
Is of the opinion that Mr. Fitch has not
found a new mineral. He said:
acid or aqua rejrla and fiÂ«itroytag all tit*
metals found In it tha pracipltats (till
gives forth tn* same bright light by fric
tion. It Is claimed by tha finder that It
will make ono of the finest carbons for
lighting purposes, and h* also supposes It
will make a good storage battery when
properly handled.
Though many havÂ» been working upon
this mineral, no one yet seems to have
found out exactly what It Is and many
and widely differing are the opinions aa to
Its value. Its use and . properties. Some
believe that It may be a zinc blend with
a slight showing of radium. Others say
that It shows an electrical resistance of
1.57 volts. Still others have found It to
be a great resistant when In It* natural
state, but not when fused. It has also
been found to show great spiro-electrlcl
ty caused by the presence In It ox" consid
erable zinc
E. B. Preston of tha Mining Buxtau is
of the opinion that It Is not a new min
eral, but a phenomenon caused by un
known electrical conditions. Specimens of
the mineral have been sent to Edison
and to the Smithsonian Institution. Edi
son has given it as his opinion that It Is
tine blend. . Experiments In photogrraphy
have been made by Mr. Fitch with the
mineral In the hope that he may succeed
In finding radium present, but the color
plates so far have shown no signs of tha
presence of radio, active ore.
At Berkeley several student* are work
ins upon this mlneraloglcal problem un
der the direction of Professor Christy. Ac

Exasperating as it was, Joy Molineau's
laughter was pretty to hear. Harrington
did not mind it. He had long s'r.ce been
broken in. Besides, he was no exception.
Ehe had forced all her lovers to suffer In

then, her lips parted, her color heightened
by the sharp kiss of the frost, her eyes
\ibrant with the lure which is the great

nowhere save in woman's eyes. Her sled

again.
"What do you say. Wolf Fang? If him

Wolf Fang picked up his ears and
growled at Harrington.

with feminine Irrelevance, rising to her
feet and straightening out the team.
Her lover looked on stolidly. She had
kept him guessing from the first time they
met, and patience had been Joined unto
his virtues.
"Hi. Wolf Fang!" she cried, springing
upon the s!ed as it leaped into sudden
motion. "Ai! Va! Mush-on!"
From the corner of his eye Harrington
â¢watched her swinging down the trail to
Fortv Mile. Where the road forked and
crossed the river to Fort Cudahy, she
baited the dogs and turned about.
"Oh, Mlstalre Lazy Mans!" she called
back. "Wolf Fang, him say yesâ If you

But somehow, as such things will, it
leaked out. and all Forty Mile, which had
hitherto speculated on Joy Molineau's
choice between her two latest lovers, now
hazarded bets and guesses as to which
would win In the forthcoming race. The
"camp divided Itself Into two factions and
every effort was put forth in order that
their respective favorites miQht be the
first In at the finish. There was a scram
ble for the best dogs the country could
afford, for dogs, and good ones, were es
sential, above all, to success. And it
meant much to the victor. Besides the
possession of a wife, the like of which
bad yet to be created. It stood for a
mine worth a million at least.
That fall, when news came down of Mc-
Cormack's discovery on Bonanza, all the
Lower Country,, Circle City and Forty

kon-at least all save those who. like
Jack Harrington and Louis Savoy, were

Then the clear voloo of Joy '"""TttflU

Wolf Fang heard. He left the trail
sharply, heading directly for his mis

He obeyed, shrugged his shoulders in
token that he yielded not to the dictate

nodded to reassure him.
All noise ceased. Men paused In tho
placing of bets.

Here the first relays waited, but here,

covered that Olaf Nelson* had -failed to
make the down- Yukon trip to file upon
his property. Men cast hungry eyes upon
the ownerless claim, where they knew a
thousand-thousand dollars waited but
shovel and sluice-box. Yet they dared
not touch It; for there was a. law which
permitted sixty days to lapBe between the
staking and the filing, during; .which time
the claim was Immune. The whole coun
try knew of Olaf Nelson's disappearance,
and scores of men made preparation for
the Jumping; and for the consequent race
to Fort Cudahy.
But competition at Forty Mile was lim

to the equipping, either of Jack Harring

enough to enter the contest single-handed.
It wai a stretch of 100 miles to the-Re

two favorites should have four relays of
dogs stationed along the trail. Nat
urally the last relay was to be the crucial
one, and for these twenty-live miles their
respective partisans strove to obtain the
strongest possible animals. So bitter did
the factions wax. and so high* did : they

**Ofc, chCdrtn, do wait a minute. Don't

Crocker as sh* placed -a dainty linen cen
ter-piece on the polished table and
crowned It with a pot of ferns. "Walt
- until . I get some plates," and she flew
about like a busy housewife, putting
doylies here and there under the plates
and looking out , for everything In gen
eral. "Now, pop," she said when all was
ready, "you sit In your own place and I'll
play mamma, because she Isn't here.
What do you want Kate? Grapes? What
kind, the green ones?" and Florence, a
black-haired, merry-eyed lassie of 1*. or
thereabouts. Imitated the gracious hostess
to a nicety. Not one thing escaped her
watchful eyes and the new found dignity
that clothed her chubby person was
charming to see.
"Huh. You'd better make the most of.
your time," Harry calmly remarked be
tween bites aa he punished a rosy cheeked
apple. "I am," and Just then, catching
his father's eye, the two went oft hi a
perfect peal of laughter that set the rest
of us pondering for a minute and then
eating faster than ever.
"Really, .Miss Moore, I'm afraid we
won't have much of an opportunity to
talk over tike situation unless X send tha
children upstairs," remarked the candi
date as he rose from the table, and I
really didn't think it worth while to tell
him that I had tucked up my sleeve all
the politics I needed or wanted to know
about during my three hours' visit It
was the man himself I wanted .to study
and not the theories that he was advanc
ing.
As he went out the front door a tall,
slender boy came in the side gate and I
would almost be willing to wager my
very head that I solved another solution
of the man's popularity.
"Hello, Uncle Henry," called out the
chap cheerfully as he sauntered toward
us. "How are you?"
"Fine, old man. fine,** came the quick
rejoinder as he shook hands cordially
with the newcomer. "How's everybody at
home?"
This little episode conveyed a great deal
to me, although It seemingly was but an
everyday occurrence. As I -watched the
two it suddenly dawned upon me that I
had known mighty few men who treated
a boy In his first long trousers as a "Â«Â».
and I could keenly appreciate how such a
thoughtful act would be a balm to tha
tormented, sensitive nature of â¢Â» a half*
grown boy. , ' -â Â¦ *r
"No go. Stay wif me," cam* from a
totally unexpected quarter, and the des
pot of the house commenced into
my arms. ."Baby likes "oo." But alas

showed that her training had begun early
in life, for she exercised her woman's
prerogative of changing her rniw^ and de
serted the hairy bowwow about my neck
for the real, four-legged one that trotte4
around the corner Just then.
The last glimpse I caught of the Crocker
family as the ear whirled me away was
the would-be Mayor trotting about thsj
lawn holding "Babe's** wee, short skirt aa
she rode triumphantly on Carlo, the old

Marian, the second daughter, held back
as we were about to take a< picture, and
when no one was looking slipped into the
house. .'^A- v
"Florence, I wish you would ask Ma

then when the deserter returned he said
very simply, "I'll consider it a favor, Ma
rian, If 'you'll be in this one. 'However,
if you don't want to, all weh and good."
That struck me as being a mighty clever
way of gaining his point for In treating
her as an equal he tickled her vanity and
she led very gently where she might havo

,. It's a strenuous piece of business trying
to get a word In edgewise with this nom
inee, for the bell rang constantly and the
telephone kept up a mad burring as
though it were possessed, to gay nothing
of the busy stump speakers within his
own walls.
Once as w passed the phone it clam
ored so persistently that Mr. Crocker took
the receiver off the hook, more to pacify
it than anything else.
"Hello. Yes. :-Â¦ . Why, hello, eld , man.

"Two. five, six," X counted Just above
my breath, scarcely believing my own
eyes. t
"Yes, that's "right" laughed Mr.
Crocker as he stooped and picked up Miss
Mary Julia, a. small lad v of some three
summers. "Roosevelt can't complain
about our family. We have the maglo
number, haven't we, B^abe?" But "Babe"
in a flt of shyness burled her yellow curls
under her father's arm like a small os
trich and no amount of coaxing could
make her do more than shake her head
decidedly and emphatically. It's very evi
dent she has a will of her own, and fur
thermore she has discovered it was given
her to use.
"Mrs. Crocker and I think there's
nothing like a good-sized family," he
added as he righted her ladyship and set
her on his arm head up j and feet down,
and the smile on his - face leaped from
one to another until the entire six were
nodding and beaming their utmost ap
proval.
There they were lined up as for a bat
tle royal, with the rank of every man
duly designated In buttons, until Clark,
who couldn't keep still three consecutive
minutes to save his life, broke file In a
very unsoldierly fashion.
"Come see the new bird Â¦ cage," he
chirped as he slipped his hand Into mine
and skipped along toward a bright,
sunny room "See! It's a new one and
we had to get It because the cat got in
the other night and killed ten of our
pretty birds. We've onlf got sixteen
now. See that little one flying about?
That's a strawberry bird and he's so lit
tle he slips through the wires, but he
don't go out of this window. Isn't that
funny? And see here." as he piloted me
to a sheltered spot, "this Is a blind bird."
Instantly his little face changed and
grew all solicitation as he gently stroked
the afflicted canary. "Poor blrdy."
"But Clark," his father asked as he
tousled the fair head that leaned conn
den tly against him, "do you think every
body wants to hear about the blrdy's
troubles?" - â¢ â¢
"Why, pop,", in a perfectly astounded
fashion, "aren't you sorry V and the child
looked anxiously Into the face bent over
him.
"Why, < *yes, son, I'm very, sorry." came
the aulck response, "but It's hardly fair
to make Miss Moore sorry, too," and after
turning It over in his mind for' a second
the two seemed to understand each other
perfectly, and all was ; serene again.
â¢It's a positive pleasure; to see the great
simplicity and kindness with which this
father treats his children. There isn't the
faintest suggestion of discord, search for
it as one may, but Instead there's a feel

not only respect him, but who will rise up
and call him blessed.
While they are perfectly. behaved chil

Evidently electioneering Is tight In his
line, for I could scarcely see him behind
a barricade of "Crocker for Mayor" but

"Hav* a button?" he suddenly asked as
he spied X was viewing his decoration.
**I think they're rather good," he added
with the wisdom of a sage as he solemnly

when X nodded and assured him that I
would be delighted to be so adorned he
magnanimously ruined a cherished '. geo
metrical design that ran from the top of
his shoulder to the bottom of his short

"What makes you do it?" I Impulsively
asked Crocker senior as Crocker Junior

"Well, I think It's high time some man

Woman and Children SectionBut after you get used to them all, and
learn how to adjust them, and how to
wear them, you grow accustomed to your,
style of dress and you like It better than
the old waUt and skirt plan.
The picture coat of fall Is very much
like a French garment in that It is all
detail. One coat which is a sample of
the pretty things of autumn is of a shaue
of claret red cloth. It is fitted in the
back and thera Is a cape which comes
below the elbows. The coat is sleeveless,
being more like a cloak- or shoulder cape,
except for its fitted back, while the front
bangs down in perfectly straight lines.
The front of the cloak which hangs
open shows a facing in blue satin cut in
Grecian pattern, with seed pearls set in
the pattern. The entire cloak 1b lined with
white taffeta, and though dark In color
la exceedingly light in weight
Mrs.' Reginald Vanderbilt, who has been
considerably entertained in Paris, wears
a cloak which -would answer nicely for
an evening cloak for fall. It is mad o of
a black brocade, with a small rose col
ored design running 1 over it There is. of
course, the inevitable shoulder cape, or
very deep collar, and this is edged with
fur, laid on in the very narrowest strips.
The bottom of the cloak has three silk
muslin ruffles and the front is trimmed
with a Jabot of silk ruffles.
The French dress Is distinguished by
the' bows that hook over and fall Into
place, by the frills that fasten 'invisibly
and hang as they should hang, by the
many lltue lace ends, by the narrow bor
derings of fur which the French like so
well, and by the abundance of chiffon
ruffllngs.
Mrs. Vanderbilt's Cloak.
The French are exquisftely feminine In
their methods of dress, and this is per
haps the reason why they for so many
years led the world in all dress matters.
If anything they suffer from too much
dress, from too many frills, from too
much detail and too much- fuss. The
woman who puts on a French dress for
the first time wonders how she will ever
get out of it, for there are fastenings In
numerable.
It Is not necessary to be masculine in
order to be trim looking or In order to
be tailor made, and the best dressed wom
en are those who have found it out and
are neat and smart but not mannish.
The; picture coat is left unfastened Be
that the picture gown is visible and tha
girl of? autumn can" take her choice be
tween matching her fall hat , to her coat
or matching her hat to her gown. The
picture coat flies wide open and many of
the coats have actually no way of fasten
ing. ;
But a much better style Is. the double
breasted picture coat which Is Intended
to.be worn wide open with both lapels
rolled back. On occasion, however, " the
coat can be closed in a double breasted
manner and the front made as secure as
possible, and as tailored In effect as any
coat that was ever made. 1
After the picture coat Is closed, and Its
double breasted fronts are lapped, it is
fastened Invisibly. To fasten such a coat
invisibly there must be fiat buttons of
crocheted material ' and little . loops also
crocheted. . The loops are slipped over the
buttons) and there you - are. You can
scarcely see the fastenings. '
Still another way to fasten the picture
coats is with , very large crocheted orna
ments, which can be In striking contrast
to the coat. Upon the ecru: colored coats
there are black crocheted balls and hang-
Ing crocheted cords and tassels," balls and
looping* of all sorts. , ~ These make very
handsome fastenings for the coat.
Â¦ But the jewelers, and those 'who enjoy
seeing ; a ; woman spend money Â¦ for ' her
decoration, are encouraging* the wearing
of 'the handsome Jeweled â¢ ornament, < and
there are the loveliest : fastenings . con
nected. by chains . and placed upon the
front of the newest of the picture coats.
Ornaments Jof this kind can lie trans
ferred from coat to gown and from gown
to â¢ coat, and bo kept forever ' bo that they

How- to Fasten Your Coat.
They have a way now Â«f trimming the
fall coatis with fur that' is very pretty.
"and -as It takes only a suggestion of fur,
It could be, adopted by any woman. The
fur Is cutâ arid cut fur, always cut on
the wrong sideâ In strips that measure no
more . than a quarter of an Inch. This
makes a very . delicate edge. And the
strips are laid side' by side, an Inch apart

down the front of the coat.
It Is particularly", swell to trim your
Bklrt with very : narrow bands of fur, tne
narrower you can -cut It the better, so
that your, skirt and your coat match each
other. Â¦, But. this -Is not necessary.
â¢In the making, or In the buying of a
picture coat for fall wear the woman
Â¦who buys it must endeavor to preserve
the feminine appearance of the coat.
Every woman knows a feminine coat
from a masculine coat. There is nothing
bo repulsive as a masculine looking wo
man, masculine in dress and In manner
of wearing it, and it must be confessed
that some of the coats of fall have a man
nish look which must be done away with
before the coat will be pretty.
A young woman strode up Fifth avenue
the other day with a rolled silk umbrella
in her hand, swung smartly as a cane.
Bhe wore a long ulster shaped coat of
ladles' cloth In deep gray and on her bead
there rested a mannish felt hat adorned
Â¦with a ribbon. Her gloves were castor
gloves and her boots were the heavy ones
which 6ome girls affect The result was
not pleasing, though probably intended to
be swagger.
A pleasant contrast to this was a young
woman who took her constitutional up the
avenue In a very trim peacock blue glazed
taffeta skirt, cut .to walking length, and
laid In many little box plaits around the
hips. The upper part was a three-quarter
r ilk coat with a very neat belt.* There
were wide lapels, profusely, embroidered.
and embroidered cuffs. An Immense hat
of the new Gainsborough type, which
shows a caoare crown with or without
the feather, Mt her off.
A very fine picture coat of broadcloth
was lined with chiffon, all laid in the
tiniest ruffles. This is a decided luxury,
but the woman who wants to own such
a ccat can line it with shirred Bilk, or
Bilk muslin. If chiffon is too dear.
The Feminine Instinct.
Of course the fur coat will come In,
and. on the snapping days, there is noth
ing bo becoming, nothing bo cheering,
nothing so rich as a nice coat of seal or
â¢Persian lamb. But winter is a long way
cU and womankind loves to revel In a
tittle between season coat, which shall
net as a mediator between the lawns of
eummer and the furs of winter.
Yet this may be an extreme statement,
for a Fifth avenue modlstÂ© only yesterday
showed one of. her customers a delightful
little picture coat of pongee in blue, with
a little shoulder cape and with a braided
front. Inside there was a very com
fortable lining cf silk with a little wad
ding, showing that the coat could be
worn all winter. A stunning monogram
was embroidered Inside.
The picture coat Is made of no particular
material, for it is equally picturesque if
made of ladies' cloth or of silk. It is also
excellent in pongee, but pongee, ss a fall
material, is a little light and. as autumn
deepens pongee, poplin and the alpaca
revivals will be laid away until next
rprlng.
1 Y OU have heard of the picture hat
/ I and the picture dress. But have
M you heard of the picture coat?
Nearly all the coats of fall are
-" picture coats; Eharp, distinctive
and beautiful.
These are the main features of the
lecture coat:
It will be long, so as not to spoil a
woman's lines.
It will be belted or not, , as may please
you.
If belted the belt will be worn very
loose, as a mere girdle.
If unbelted the coat will 6weei> away
from the figure, making the most charm
ing curve that can be Imagined.
The picture coat will invariably be worn
open, for one of the principal points in
its favor is that it is designed to show
off the gown over which it is worn, in
stead of concealing it.
There abounds in Paraguay a tree,
growing to the stature of an ordinary
chestnut tree, from which a kind of vege
table silk Is obtained. Mr. Ruffln, United
States Consul at Asuncion, says he be

"Oh, yes, we are selling the fall pic
ture hat weeks in advance of the season
and .the reason is - this: The high
crowded .. Gainsborough Is back; women

with a little bow of velvet at one side.
That Is the only trimming and all is In

The Coming Big Hat.
"Take your old cloak, madame, and
have a pattern stamped upon It. No
matter how soiled the cloak may be nor^
how worn. Tou can have It cleaned and -
the worn places will not show.*
"Now take narrow taffeta ribbon and
applique It to the cloak in such a manner
that you trace the entire pattern. Do
not embroider It, except a few stitches
here and there, where It Is necessary to
keep the design. But let your ribbons
carry out the pattern. Keep all In one
color, 'for It Is dangerous to try different
colors upon It/
'["When this Is done your cloak is trans
formed. But you must add a deep collar
which shall come down . to a very long
low point In the fronf and lie flat over
the shoulders and across the ' back.
"If you add velvet cuffs your coat will
be complete for fall wear, but If you
Â¦till desire more ' you can transform thÂ»
cloak Into something extremely dressy
for evening wear.
"Taking enough chiffon ruffling for the
purpose you can trim the whole foot of
your cloak with It and you can border
your wide cape with' It. You have now
something that is really dressy."
This may be a hint to the woman who
would be right up to the scratch in fash

At a luncheon given to Sir Thomas Lip- '

"And then." the hatter went on to say.
"hats are treated to different trimmings
Just as waists are changed by putting
on one day a white lace collar and an
other day a new stock. - It takes but a
minute to unfasten a feather and to ad-
Just a rose and the hat Is Â» new" one."
A word to the wise woman Is sufficient
in this respect.
Speaking of the new cloaks brings one
to a pretty wrinkle which is being Intro
duced in many of the nicest of the fall
garments. It takes a practical form, but
a form that is certainly much appreci
ated. It is prosaic for it is nothing more
nor less than a new dress shield, designed
to protect the delicate fabrics trom the
heat' of the body. That such a shield 1Â»
necessary all who have worn the chang
able. silks, the Louisines and the light
materials will attest.
To make. one of these new shields, as
they are now made by the best of dress
makers, you buy an .ordinary pair of
shields and cover them on the outside
with a bit of material tha same color as
the coat. Tou then set them Into the
armholts with invisible stitches or with
tha smallest of safety pins. They are now
absolutely Invisible and that they save
their weight in diamonds before the sea
son is out there is not the slightest doubt.
Once the trick is learned you will never
forget it.
The Hew Shirt "Waist Suit.
There Is another autumn wrinkle for tha
picture woman with the picture hat and
the picture coat and this la the autumn
shirt waist suit which goes under the
coat. It matches the coat In color and
often In materials. But Its point is that
It Is a dark suit with the waist and the
skirt just alike. They are made in one
piece, that is, they are sewed together
at the belt line, so that one belt answers
for both, and a woman puts on her skirt
and waist all at once, hooking the skirt
and buttoning up the waist.
After ; the long wrestling with waist
bands, to keep skirt and waist from sev
ering their diplomatic relations, a depart
ure of this kind is hailed with tearful
gratitude by the woman of progress who
hastens off to purchase such a gown at
once.
A very large spider web formed the con
necting link between a handsome fall
calling dress and a fall calling cloak. The
"dress, which showed a beautiful royal
blue tone, was embroidered In front with
a gray spider web done in silk. The cloak,
which was also of royal blue, had three
small webs running up each side of It.
The top of the hat, the crown, also
showed a spider web. thus making the
whole suit match.
At a dinner siven to Sir Thomas, for
dinners . galore have been spread before
the Knight, there was a guest in a con
servatory cloak, which Is a cloak with
wide sleevesâ a dinner coat It might be
called. It Is worn with a decollete gown
and is designed to protect the shoulders
from draught. It can be slipped off dur
ing the dinner.
This conservatory cloak was made of
piece lace over a lining of the same color,
all in ecru. The only contrast was found
in a bunch of black knots upon the bust
where the cloak fastened.

10. Provisions From TreejL
There Is a tree which crows tn Sumatra,
Algeria and China which Is known as ths
vegetable tallow tree. From Its fruit large
quantities of oil and tallow are extracted.
and the fruit Is gathered In November or
December, when all the leave* have
fallen. Excellent candles are made from
the berries of a tree which grows In soma
parts of South Africa and tha Azores.
At Sierra Leone Is found the cream fruit
tree, the fruit of which is very agreeable
In taste. In Ceylon there Is the: bread
fruit trÂ«e. from which a food ts made tn
the same way that we make bread. It Is
said to be equally good and nutritious. In
South America we find the milk tree,-*
decorated with tufts of the lone hair,
and on the other is the imag* of a bear,
emblem of th* mountains, laboriously
carved In the lone winter *venings by the
light of th* fire In an Alpine hut. On the
other hand, doesn't this great German
apparatus suggest steins and Jollity?
Whenever I look at It I remember a Jour
ney up th* Rhine when the passengers
drew about the tables on deck and drank
Bavarian beer ; and puffed at Just such
pipes as this all the way from Mains to
Koblents, that Is for the better part of
a . long, lazy summer's day."
"So the pipes typify th* lives of the
peopleâ at least the pleasure-loving side of
them?" I asked.
"Exactly! And from what side can one
better see the real people themselves? In
their working hours aren't they controlled
by circumstances less natural \ and free?
But on their pleasuring, in the German
Gardens or alons* the Boleâ there their
true selves have a chance to eome to the
surface, "there you can really make the
acquaintance of the world and his wifeâ
and his pipe. . - .
' ."But to have your pipes of any value,"
Mrs. Marlowe went on, Jthey 'must have
been smoked, must have had a history.
Now in buying Indian pipes you will at
first fall ; a victim < to, th* much-painted,
many-plumed carving ' of an Indian such

"Of course th* finest work of a pip*
la usually on the bowl, but even the
stems have a history. Many of them, per-
haps the choicest, are made from cnerry

SOCIETY WOMAN'S FAD FOR
PIPES
Yhctos laj Btuftmail.At sundown everything was shipshape.
There hadn't been an engine failure In the
district for twenty-four hours and every
handcar was running smoothly. More
over, there were no extra sections marked
up and only one special on the division
cardâ a theatrical train eastbound with
Henry Irving and company from 'Frisco
to Chicago. The Irving special was heavy,
as It always is; that night there were five
just a firlaxle of rain falling- through the
mountains when I got down to the depot
at seven o'clock that Sunday evening. I
don't know how much sUep Blackburn
had had during the day. but he had been
at Fred Norman's bed most of the after
noon with Doubleday and Carhart Â«o he
couldn't have had much. About halt-past
seren Maxwell sent me over there with a
note and his storm coat for him, and the
turee men were In the room then. Boy
like. I, hung around until it was time for
Blackburn to take his trick, and then he
and Doubleday and I walked over to the
Wickiup together.
The west-bound Overland passenger No.
1 was due to leave Ames at 12:40 a. m..
and- ordinarily would have met a special
like the Irving at Rosebud, which is a
good bit west of the river. But No. l's
engine had been steaming badly all the
way from McCloud. and on her schedule,
which waa crazy fast all night she did
The -lights in the yard were low and
the drizzle bad eased into a mist; it was
a nasty night, and yet one never promised
better for quiet Before midnight the
switchmen were snug in the yard shan
ties; In the Wickiup there was the night
ticket agent and the night baggageman
downstairs. Upstairs every door was
locked and every room was dark, except
tho dispatcher's office. In th$ Blackburn
sat at bis key; near by. but closer to the
stove, sat the night caller for the train
crews, trying to starch his hair with a 10

the roundhouse; Doubleday had gone
back to sit with Fred Norman.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
burn and the tall master mechanic sprang
at each other In a silent fury. No man
dare say where it might have ended had
not Fred Norman staggered between them
with his , hands upâ but the blood wu
gushing from his mouth.
It was pretty serious business. They
caught him as he fell and the boy lay on
Blackburn's arm limp as a dead wire; no
body thought after they saw that hemor
rhage that he would ever live to have an
other. I was scared sick, and I never saw
a man so' cut up as Doubleday. Black
burn was cool in a second, for he saw
quicker than others and he, knew there
was danger of tho little dispatcher's dy
ing right there in his tracks. Blackburn
stood over him. as much at home facing
death as he was in a fight or In a dis
patcher's chair. He appeared * to know
It was a gloomy day around the depot
Everybody was talking about the trouble
and the way it had begun and the way It
had ended. They, talked in undertones,
little groups in corners and In rooms with
the doors â¢ shut There wasn't much of
that in our day there, and it waa depress
ing. I went home early to bed, for I was
on nights. But the wind sung so, even
in the afternoon, that I couldn't quiet
We were handling trains then on the old
oingle-order system. I mention this be
cause in no other way could this particu
lar thing have happened; but there's no
especial point In that, since other particu
lar things do happen all the time, single
order/ double order or no order system.
The * wind . had dropped and . there wsa
baggage cars, a coach and two sleepers.
I am particular to lay all this out Just as
the night opened when Blackburn took
his train sheet, because sometimes these
things happen under extraordinary pres
sure on the line and sometimes they
don't; sometimes they happen under pres
sure on the dispatcher himself. It waa all
fixed, too, for Blackburn to handle not
only his own trick but the first two hours
of Fred's trick, which would carry him
till six o'clock In/ tbe morning. At six
Maxwell was to double Into a four-hour
dogwatch and Callaghan was to sit In till
noon.
There was nothing to hold the big fel
lows around the depot that " night and
they began straggling home through the
rain about nine o'clock. Before ten,
Bucks and Callahan had left the office;
not make Ames tin some fifty minutes
late. While there were no special orders.
It was understood we were to help the
Irving train as much as possible, anyway.
Bucks had made the acquaintance of the
great man and his fellow* on the west
bound run, and as they had paid us the
particular compliment of a return trip,
we were minded to give them the best of
itâ even against Ne. I. which was atwaya
rather sacred on the sheet This. I say.
was pretty generally understood; for
when it was" all over there was no criti
cism whatever on Blackburn's Intention
of making a meeting point for the two
trains, as they then stood, at O'Fallon's
siding.
Between Ames and Rosebud, twenty
miles apart, there are two sidingsâ
O'Fallon's, west of the river, and Bait
It wasn't the kind of a timeâ they
weren't the kind of menâ to ask or volun
teer explanations. Blackburn waa on
Doubleday in a wink, and before Walter
could tight himself the night dispatcher
had thrown him headlong across the
room. As the operators rushed in Black-
Doubleday was right in his device, as
time has proved; but- It was unheard of
then, and moreover the assistant master
mechanic, sensitive to criticism at any
time, was a fearful man to run against.
Sunday morning he and Norman met in
the trainmaster's office. They went at
each other like sparks, and when Double
day, who had a hard mouth, began curs
ing Fred, the poor little dispatcher, rank
ling with the trouble, anyway half slcR,
went all to pieces and flew at the big
fellow like a sparrow hawk. He threw a
wicked left Into the master mechanic be
fore Doubleday could lift a guard. But
Walter Doubleday, angry as he was,
couldn't strike Fred. He caught up both
the boy's hands and pushed him, strug
gling madly, back against the wall to
slap his face, when a froth of blood
stained, Fred's lips and he fell fainting;
Just at that minute Blackburn stepped
into the room. /
Whfn the investigation came it was
pretty near up to Fred Norman right
from the start, and he knew it. But
Blackburn, who shielded him when he
could, Just as all the dispatchers did, be
cause he was a boyâ and a sick one
among menâ tried to take part of the
blame himself. He could afford it, Black
burn; his shoulders were broad and he
hadn't so much as a fly speck on his book.
Bucks looked pretty grave when the evi
dence was all In, and around the second
floor they guessed that meant something
for Norman. Fred himself couldn't sleep
over it, and to complicate things the en
gineer of the stalled train, who hated
Doubleday, hinted quietly that the
trouble came in the first place from
Doubleday's new-fangled idea of putting
the driver shoes behind instead of in front
of the wheels. Then the fat waa in the
fire. Fred got hold of it and, boy-likeâ
sore over his own share in the trouble
and exasperated by something Doubleday
was reported to have said 'about him over
at the^ houseâ lighted into Doubleday
about the engine failure.
There was only one tendency In Fred
Norman's dispatching that anybody
could criticise: he never seemed, after
handling trains on the plains, to appre
ciate what our mountain grades really
meant, and when they pushed him he
sent his trains out pretty close together.
It never bothered him to handle a heavy
traffic; he would got the business through
the mountains Just as fast as they could
put it at the division; but occasionally
there were some halr-curllng experiences
among the freights on Norman's trick
trying to keep off each other's coat tails.
One night In July there was a great press

the stuff came in late, on Blackburn and
part of it early on Fred, who was almost
coughing his head off about that time,
getting up at 3:30 every morning. Fred,
at 4 o'clock, took the steers and sent
them, train after train, through the Kat
River country like bullets out of a Alex
lm gun. It was hot work, and before he
had sat in an hour there was a stumble.
The engineer of a big ten-wheeler pulling
twenty-five cars of steers had been push
ing hard and, at the entrance of the
canyon, set his air so quick he sprung
one of the drive shoes and the main rod
hit it. The great steel bar doubled up
like a man with a cramp. It was showing
daylight; they made a stop and, quick
as men could do it, flagged both ways.
But the last section was crowding into
the canyon right behind; they were too

it. The hind section split Into the stand

with his laugh all in a smile, but never
a noise or a word. He enjoyed it all; not
a doubt of that; only It was all tampered.
1 reckon, by something that had gonÂ« be
fore. At least that's the way it now
strikes me. and I watched thi^se b'g fel
lows pretty closeâ the fellows who were
to turn, while I was growing up among
thtm. into managers and presidents and
magnates; and some of them from every
day catch-as-catch-can men with the
common alkali flecking their boots Into
dead men for whom marble never rose
white enough or high Â«nough.
Blackburn waÂ« four years at the Wicki
up on the night trick; it wouldn't have
seemed natural to see him there in day
light. It needed the yellow gloom of the
old kerosene lamp In the room; the
specked, knotted, warped, smoky pine
ceiling losing Itself in black and cob
webbed corners; the smoldering murk of
the soft coal fire brooding in the shabby
old salamander, and, outside in the dark
ness, the wind screwing down the gorge
and rattling the shrunken casements, to
raise Blackburn In the dispatcher's chair.
Blackburn and the lamp and the stove
and the celling and the gloomâ in a word,
Blackburn and the night trickâ they went
together.
Before the Short Line was opened the
No. 1 and No. 5 trains caught practically
all the coast passenger business. They
were Immensely heavy trains; month af
ter month we sent out two and three sec
tions of them each day and they always
ran Into our division on the night trick.
Blackburn handled all that main line
business with a mileage of 806, besides the
mountain branches, say 400 more; and the
passenger connections came off them,
mostly at night, for 1 and 5.
Now three men wrestle with Blackburn's
mileage; but that was before they found
out that dispatchers, although something
tougher than steel, do wear out. More
over, we were then a good way from civ
ilization and extra men. If a dispatcher
took sick there was no handy way of till
ing in; It was Just 'double up and do the
best you could.
One lad In the office those days every
body loved: Fred Norman. He wu off
the Burlington. A kid of a fellow who
looked more like a chore boy than a train
dispatcher. But he was all lightningâ a
laughing, restless^ artless boy, open as a
book and quick as a current There was
a better reason stilt, though, "why they
loved Fred; the boy had consumption;
that's why he was out in the mountains,
and his mother In Detroit used to write
Buck asking about him,' and she used to
send us all things in Fred's box. His
flesh was as white and as pink as moun
tain snow, and he had brown eyes; he was
a good boy, and I called him handsome.
I reckon they all did. Fred brought out
a tennis set with him, the. first we ever
saw in Medicine Bend, and before he had
been playing an hour he had Neighbor,
big as a grizzly, and Callahan, with a pipe
in one hand and a tennis guide in the
other, chasing all over .'the yard after
balls; and Halley trying to figure forty
love, while Fred taught Bucks the Law
ford drive. I don't say what he was to
me; only that he taught me all I ever
knew or ever will know about handling
trains; and, though I was carrying mes
sages then, and he was signing orders, we
were really like kids together.
Fred for a long time had the early trick.
He came on at four In the morning and
caught most of the through freights that
cot away from the river behind the pas
senger trains. There was 'no use trying
to move them In the night trick. Between
the stock trains eastbound and the both
way passenger trains. It a westbound
freight got caught in the mountains at
night the engine might as well be stand
ing in the house saving fuelâ there wasn't
time to get from one elding to another.
Bo Fred Norman took the freights as they
came and he handled them like, a ring
master. When Fred's whip cracked, by
Joe! a train had to dance right along.
I was just a boy around the Wickiup
then, but I remember the crowd; who
could forget them? They were Jolly good
fellows; sometimes there were very high
jinks. 1 don't mean anybody drunk or
that sort, but good tobacco to smoke and
food songs to sing and good stories to
tell â and Lord! bow could they tell them.
And when tbe pins slipped, as they would,
end things went wrong, as they will,
there were clear heads and pretty wit*
and stout hearts to put things right.
Blackburn, as much as I can remember,
always enjoyed It, but In a different war.
He had such times a manner like nobody
When Blackburn came from the plains
he brought a record clean as the book
of life. Four years on a station key; then
eight years at Omaha dispatching, with
never & blunder or a break to the eight
years. But it was at Omaha that Black
burn lost the wife whose face he car
ried in his watch. I never beard the
etory, enjy tone rumor of how young
the was and how pretty, and how he
burled her and tbe wee baby together.
It was all Blackburn brought to the West
End mountains, his record and the little
face In the watch. They said he had no
kith or kin on earth, besides the wife
and the babv back on the bluffs of the
Missouri; and so he came on the night
trick to us.
It was in tbe golden days of the bat
tered old Wickiup that the Btory opens;
when Blackburn eat In the night chair.
The days when the Old Guard were still
there; before death, and fame, and cir
cumstance had stolen our first comman
ders and left only us little fellows, for
gotten by every better fate, to tell their
gTeater stories.
Bailey had tbe bridges then, and Wet
xnore the locating, and Neighbor the
roundhouses, and Bucks the superlntend
ency, and Callahan, so he claimed, the
work, and Blackburn had tbe night trick.

well to state frankly at the outset
that this tale, in its inexplicable psycho

based on an extraordinary happening that

that the circumstance on which the tale

With the words the ball door opened and
Bucks, storm-beaten in his ulster, threw
It wide open and stood facing us both.
The wind that swept in behind him blew
out the lamps and left us in darkness.
"Jack, will you light up?"
It was Blackburn who^ spoke to me.
But Bucks broke in instantly, speaking
to him:
"Callahan called me over his house wire
a few minutes, ago, Blackburn, and told
me to meet him here right away. Is any
thing wrong?" he asked, with anxiety re-,
strained in his tone.
I struck a match. I was so nervous that

counter lamp and dropped It smash to

made me worse. I struck a second match.

Bucks, .uncertain with amazement,
stared at him again.
"Blackburn, If you're sane I don't know
.what you: mean. Don't stand there like
that. Do you know- what you have done?"
. Dispatcher! Don't speak: ask no quea

sharply, pointing to the Instrument. #"It

And: it was newsâ news ?rom Ames Sta

ary sending. He sat and took and sent
like one again master of the situation.
"Ask Engineer Sampson to come to tho
wire," said he to Rosebud. Sampson, not
Maje. but his brother Arnold, was pulling
Number One that night.
"Engineer Sampson here." came from
Rosebud presently.
"Ask Sampson where he met Special
202 to-night."
We waited, wrought up, for In that re
ply must come the answer to all the mys
tery. There was a hitch at the other end
of the wire: then Rosebud answered:
"Sampson says he will tell you all about
It in the morning." ; .>
"That will not do," tapped the dis
patcher. "This Is Backburn. Superin
tendent Bucks and Callahan are here.
They want the facts. Where did you
meet Special 2027"
There was another wearing delay. When
the answer came it was slowly, at the
engineer's dictation.
Bucks put up a hand and without a
word of comment repeated Blackburn's
Â¦tory Just as the dispatcher had told It.
"In any event there's nothing to do now;
It's on us or we're past It. Let us wait
for Number One to report."
Callahan pored over the order book.
"Maybe," he said after a while, "didn't
you send the orders right'and copy them
wrong in the book, Blackburn?"
The dispatcher shook his bead. "They
went as they stand. The orders lapped,
â¢Callahan. Walt till we hear from Num
ber One. I feel sure she is safe. Walt."
Bucks was pacing the floor. Callahan
stuck silent to the key, taking what little
work came, for I saw neither of the
chiefs wanted to trust Blackburn at the
key. He sat looking; for tho most part
vacantly into the fire. Callahan meantime
had the orders repeated back from Ames
and Rosebud. It was as Blackburn had
said; they did lap; they had been sent
Just as the order book showed. There
waa nothing for It but to wait for Rose
bud to hear from Number One. When the
night operator there called the dispatcher
again It brought Blackburn out of his
gloom like a thunderclap.
"Give mo the key!" he exclaimed.
"There is Rosebud." Callahan pushed
back and Blackburn, dropping into the
chair, took the message from the night
operator at Rosebud.
"Number One In 2:03 a. m."
Callahan looked around. "Gentlemen,
what does this mean? Somebody here is
Insane. I don't know whether it's me or
you, Blackburn. Are you horsing me?"
he exclaimed, raising his voice angrily.
"If you are I want to say I consider it a
damned shabby Joke."
Ueved. The Irving special e&stbound,
safely past Number One westbound, on a
Â¦ingle track, when their meeting orders
had lapped! Passed without a word of
danger or of accident, or even that they
had seen Number One and stopped in time
to avoid a collision? Exactlyâ not a word
ânothing. In at 52; out at 64. And the
actors hard asleep in the berthsâ and on
about Its business the Irving specialâ
that's what we got from Ames.
' He took their hands; started to speak;
but they pushed him into Callahan's room;
they didn't want to hear anything.
' All the night it stormed at the Wickiup.
In the morning the Irving special, flying
toward Chicago, was far down the Platte.
No. 1 was steaming west, deep in the
heart of the Rockies;. Blackburn lay In
Callahan's room. It was 9 o'clock, and
the sun was streaming through the east
windows when Fred Norman opened tha
office door. Fred could do those things
even when he was sickest. . Have a hem
orrhage one day, scare everybody to death
and go back to his trick the next. He
asked right away for Kit. as he called
Blackburn, and when they pointed to Cal
lahan's door Fred pushed it open and went
in. A cry brought the operators to him.
Blackburn was stretched on his knees half
on the floor, half face downward on the
sofa. His head had fallen between his
arms, which were stretched above it. In
his hands, clasped tight, they found his
watch with the picture of his wife and bis
baby. Had he asked, when he first went
Into that room that nightâ when he
wrestled like Jacob of old In his agony of
prayerâ that his life be taken if only
their lives, the lives of those in his keep
ing, might be spared? I do not know.
They found him dead.
"Not a word, Blackburn," put In Bucks,
resting bis big hand on the dispatcher's
shoulder; "there's no harm done; nobody
knows It. Bury the thing right here to
night. You're broke up* Go in there and
He down."
"Go in there and He down," Bald Calla
han to him. "You're used up. old fellow,
I can see that. I'll take the key. Don't
say a word."
It waaâ possible. Just possible. But to
figure once in how many times a vista
would have opened for a single second so
one engineer could see the light of an
other would stagrger a multiplying ma
chine. Chance? Well, yes, perhaps. But
there were no suggestions of that natur*
that night under the dispatcher's lamp at
the Wickiup, with the storm driving down
the pass as It drove that night; and yet
at Peace River, where the clouds never
rested, that night was clear. Blackburn,
getting up, steadied himself on his feet.
The threa men in front of me made no
comment as they looked at each other.
How was it possible for one train to have
seen the headlight of another among the
buttes of the Peace River country?
"24t orders were to hold at O'Fallon's 1
for Special 203." clicked the sounder, re
peating the engineer's halting statement.
"When we cleared Salt Rocks siding and
got down among the Quakers I waa cut
ting along pretty bard to make the can
yon when I saw, or thousht ,1 saw, a
headlight flash between the outtes across
the river. It startled me. ror I knew the
202 Special could not be very far west of
us. Anyway, I made a quick stop, and re
versed and backed tight as I could xaaka
it for Salt Rocks siding. Before we had
got a milÂ© I saw the headlight again, and
I knew the 202 was against our order.
We got into the clear Just as the Special
went by humming-. Nobody but our train
crew and my flreman knows anything
about this."
THE SUNDAY CALL.
The mystery lay, I knew, In the order
book. Curiosity gradually got the better
of ray fright, and I walked from the
cooler over to the counter to get cour
age, and I shoved the .. train register
around noisily. I crossed to the dis
patcher's table and made a pretense of
arranging the pads and blanks. The
train order book was lying open where
he had left It, under the lamp. With my
eyes bulging, I read the last two orders
copied In It: . .
C. and E. No. One. Ames. *
No. One. Eng. 871. will not hold at
O'Fallon's for Special 302.
C. and E. Special 202, Rosebud.
- Special 202. Eng. 636, will run to Salt
Rocks regardless of No. One?
SALT ROCKS! I glared at the words
and the letters of the words.
I reread the first order and read again
the second. O'Fallon's for Number One.
That was right. O'Fallon's 1* should be
for the Special 202, of course, to meet
her. But it wasn't; it was- the first sta
tion east of O'Fallon's he had ordered
the Special to run to. It was a lap order.
My scalp began to creep. A lap order for
the Irving Special and Number One pas
senger, and it doomed them to meet head
on somewhere between O'Fallon's and
the 8alt Rocks, in the Peace River
Canyon. â¢
My mouth went sticking dry. The sleet
outside had deepened Into a hall that
beat the west glass sharper and the win
dow shook again in the wind. I asked
myself, afraid to look around, what
Blackburn could be doing in Callahan's
room. The horror of the wreck impend
ing through his mistake began to grow on
me; I know what I suffered; I ask ray-
The first suspicion I had that anything
waa wrong was an exclamation from
Blackburn as he stared at the book. Put
ting it down almost at once and holding
the page open with his left hand, he
plugged Callahan's house wire and began
drumming his call. Callahan's "Aye,
aye," came back Inside cf a minute and
Blackburn tapped right at him: "Come
down." And I began to wonder what
waa up.
There was an Interval; then Callahan
asked, "What's the matter?"
2 got up and walked over to the water
tack for a drink. Blackburn again
pressed the key and repeated to Callahan
precisely the words he had used before:
"Coat down.**
When he had fixed the meeting point
Blackburn rose from his chair and sat
down by the stove. I lazily watched him.
tm, falling Into a doze as 1 eyed him
drowsily, he began to loom up In his
chair and to curl and twist toward the
roof like a signal column; then the front
legs of his chair struck the floor, and
with a start I woke. Just as he steppei

then, and from my boy's heart, in the
face of the' error, in the face of the
slaughter,, I pitied Blackburn.
Callahan'g room door opened again and
Blackburn came out of the dark. I had
left the table and was standing in front
of the stove. \He looked at me almost ea : *
gerly; the expression of his face had com
pletely changed. I never in my life saw
such a change in so few minutes on any
man's face. and. like all the rest, j it
alarmed me. It was not for me to speak
if I had been able, and he did not. He
walked straight over to the table, closed
the order book, plugged Callahan's house
wire again, and began calling him. The
assistant superintendent answered, and
Blackburn sent him Just these words:
"You need not come down." .
I heard Callahan reply with a question:"
"What is the matter?"
Blackburn stood calmly over the key,
but he made no answer. Instead, he re
peated only the words, "You need not
come down."
Callahan, easily excitable always, was
wrought up. "Blackburn." he answered
over the wire, Impatiently, "What in
God's name is the matter?"" But Black
burn only pulled the plug and cut t him
out, and sunk into the chair like a man
wearied.
Â¦ " Â¦ .
"Mr. Blackburn," I said, my heart
thumping like an-jnjector, "Mr. Black
burn?" He | glanced vacantly around;
saemed for the first time to see me. "Is
there anything," Waltered. "I can do?"
Even if the .words meant nothing, the
offer must have touched him. "No.

â¢Blackburn answered the .superintendent.
"Something serious has happened," be re
plied to Bucks. "I aent lap orders at 1
o'clock for No. 1 and the Irving Special."
Bucks stared at him.
"Instead of making a meeting point at
O'Fallon's I sejnt One an order, to run to
O'Fallon's and ordered the special to run
to Bait Rocks against One."
â¢'Why, my God!" exclaimed Bucks, "that
will brine them together Inâ tho Peace
Canyon. Blackburn!âBlackburn!âBlack
burn!" he cried, tearing off his "storm
coat.- He walked to the table, seized the
order book and steadied himself with one
hand on the chair. I never saw him llkÂ»
that. But It looked as If the horror long
averted, the trouble In the Peace River
Canyon, had come. The sleet tore at the
old depot like a wolf, and with the sash
shivering', Bucks turned like an execu
tioner on hli subordinate. . ., Â¦
"What have you done to meet It?" He
drew his watch, and his words came
sharp as doom. "Where's your wreck
ers? Where's your relief? What have
you done? What are you doing? Noth
ing? Why don't you speak? Will you
kill two tralnloads of people without an
effort to do anything?"
His voice rang absolute terror to me.'
I looked toward Blackburn perfectly help
less.
"Bucks, there- will be no wreck," he
answered steadily.
"Be no wreck!" thundered Bucks, tow
ering In the dingy room dark as the sweep
of the wind. "Be no wreck? Two pas

They sat on the stone doorstep in the
twilight of a late July day. Tha girl was
looking pensively at the red sky.
"I am Adam," he announced, presenting
tha card, "and this is Eden I am making.
I fear I'm doing It badly," he added, with
a deprecatory wave toward the gouged
hedge.
"Rather," said the girl, her eyes spark
ling. "If you like, papa will lend you the
gardener."
"Oh, no," said Adam: "this is to be
an Eden of â¢ my own making. Therein
lies tha charm."
"Eve, by Jove!" he asserted, as she
entered. . Then he returned to his hedge
trimming with a vigor which threatened
to exterminate it. f
After that they entered into the Jol
llest sort ; of friendship. Every morning
she called across the fence, "Good morn

was awkwardly lopping off the twigs,
when he became aware some one was
watching him from the other side of the
fence. He turned and saw a girl looking
at him ' from the depths of a sunbonnet.
She was an amazingly pretty girl, and
the laughter lurking ln her eyes was a
trifle disconcerting.
"Good morning," she said. ."Are you
our new neighbor?"
Breck doffed his hat and. fishing in his
vest pocket, found a card. He approached
the girl. :
The father seemed old and feeble. Les
lie saw him in the evening wandering
among the rose bushes on the lawn. A
girl of thirteen or fourteen was with him,
but "Elizabeth" did not appear.
In the morning he was starting for the
fields, when her voice came to him over
the high stone wall. "Madge." she called,
"come here and help me<carry this rug;
it's so heavyl" Madge was slow ln com
ing, but Leslie vaulted over the wall, and
ran up the steps of the little cottage. A
shapely head, covered with braids of soft,
brown hair, and two great, dark eyes
looked at him inquiringly.
, "Pardon me," he said, "but you called."
1 t'Yes," she replied; "I called my sister.

farm, for Jimmy Cregar had ; closed the >
deal then and there, and a deed to the"
place, duly drawn up; and recorded, had
reposed in a pigeonhole of Adam's desk
since' November.
That evening Adam sat on the stone
doorstep of his Buttonwood house. He
had been most happily disappointed In
the place. The house was a low, ram
bling story-and-a-half affair, in an excel
lent state of repair. An inviting piazza
ran along the northern side; the western
end . was half hidden , under : rambler rose
bushes . Just ' coming . Into bloom, and a
box-hedge divided his ; domain from the
road. To. tha 'left he 'could see the cozy
house of a nearby .neighbor, Dr. Thurs
ton, as Breck. learned from the lantern
above the gatepost next door. The peace
and quiet ; of the ; place appealed ; to him.
Seated there" ln the red twilight, Adam
suddenly, felt a desire to remain hereâ to
build up the place by his own efforts. Sell
it, rent it, give it away? No, Indeed. He
would build it into .a Jlttle . Eden of his
own devising.' And, the mood being strong
upon him, he trudged the mile and a half
to town;to telegraph for his effects.

"Thank you," she said, and she thanked

Madge and her father came up, and she
introduced him to them, "Mr. Leslie,

members and invited guests. I was not

to enjoy tha dinner without being pos
sessed by tha awful apprehension that X
would forget my extemporaneous speech.
The first toast of the evening was *The

ha didn't buy any Sierra Nevada for ma.
and It was Just as well for me and a food
deal better. for him, for If hÂ» had don*
so, and carried it. he would have carried
It down hill, for it went from eighty dol
lars a share down to a dollar a share*
with certainty and celerity. .
. The next day Jacket stood at $8 per
share until just before the close of the
board, when It advanced to $10. The suc
ceeding morning It opened at $12 and ad-
maw prevented^me rrom becoming a mil
lionaire. It was ' in the middle '70's,
when the Comstock mines were yielding
their treasures at the rate of several mil
lions in silver and ,gold each month, and
the San Francisco stock / market was
booming with a mighty, boom. I was at
Virginia City on a business visit, when
there came a tap at my. room door about
10 o'clock at riight, and there entered a
miner from the Yellow Â¦ Jacket mine,
whom I had successfully defended some
years before from a homicide charge and
who was grateful for the service. He in
formed me that he had charge of the
drilling machine in the mine," that he had
kept and assayed a handful of the bor
ings and that there was a large body of
rich ore that would soon be uncovered.
Jacket was then quoted at $S per share
on ,the San Francisco board. I had no
telegraphic cipher and was afraid' to send
an open dispatch, so I wrote a note to the
head of the firm of brokers In San Fran
cisco who had my account directing them
to sell all my holdings at market rates
and buy Jacket, and keep buying it to
the margin limits. This note I sent by
the midnight train, knAHng that it would
reach San Francisco before the close of
the stock market next day. A sale of my
stocks would have realized $2000 or $3000 â
enough to secure the purchase of a thou
sand shares of Jacket.
Several years afterward, on my return
from Arizona, I met on Montgomery
Btreet the head of the firm who I sup
posed had availed himself of -the secret
that the miner confided to me and so
robbed me of fortune. I .greeted him
coldly. He took ma by the arm, "Come
with me to my office," said he, "I have
something to show you." Arrived at his
vanced to $20, at which figure It closed.
If my brokers had purchased a thousand
shares at $10 the advance .would have se
cured the purchase of another thousand
shares or more ' and I telegraphed ' them,
asking, "How much Jacket did you buy
for me?" The answer was, "Do not un
derstand you. Have bought no Jacket,
for you." I took ." the train that night
and found on arrival that news of the
discovery- of bonanza was out and Jacket
was selling at $40 per share. The stock
brokers disclaimed the receipt of any let
ter from me. I believed that they had
really received it and had kept for their
own account the purchases made for me.
The next morning.^ Jacket opened at $80
per share. The proceeds of sales of all
my other stocks would not have served
to margin more than a hundred
and I did not invest at all, but watched
advance 510 at a time, until within
a week it reached $250 a share. If my
letter had been received and its instruc
tions followed, I would within fifteen days
have realized over $2,000,000. These figures
are not conjectural for those who, like
myself, were in the s secret, made five
times that sum out of > the strike In Tel
low Jacket i ,
. I related this incident to a friend, who
eald, "Don't you know I was in that
Jacket deal? I had a tip from one of
the Nevada Bank crowd and I ran a
thousand dollars up to a. hundred and
fifty thousand." "What did you do with
it?" said I. "Oh, I bought a raisin vine
yard for my wife down Fresno way with
twelve thousand of it, and as for the rest

special election t fill a vacancy, and to
the astonishment of everybody was de

a few months in San Francisco. "I ac

"those who knew my opponent and did
not know me voted for me. Those who

With old Crookneck left so far behind he looked much like a speck. ;;*
But when the final stretch was reached the leaders tripped and fell
And threw their riders over their heads in a way that I can't telL
While Gherkin and young Sugar Plum were sprawling on the track, '
.Old Crookneck taw his one last chance and gave Ms hone a whack.
The dapple-gray sped toward the wire like a streak of lightning bluÂ»,

It grieves me, pets, to tell you that the joyous day was marred,
And the ones that caused the trouble should have been quickly tanned
and tarred.
Immediately ; after the running race young Garlic, rough, uncouth,
Picked a quarrel with little Pepper red, a sweet and harmless youth.
* After a desperate mix-up, in which Tomato was badly maimed, --
Young Garlic was roughly rushed to jail and before a judge arraigned.
He was sentenced to spend c month or two in a dungeon dark and drear,
1 Where the solitude and spooklings chilled his heart with greatest fear.
!?oor Tomato, 'twas later found, was so seriously mashed and bruised'
That the doctors put â¢ m in a jar and to all admittance refused.
The sufferer, sweets, grew worse and worse, and the doctors gave up hope,
u.nd in connection with young Garlic the populace talked of rope.
1 Tomato went to pieces before they strung the miserable wretch up,
And the doctor's jury said it was simply a serious case of "ketchup.'*
' The committee on arrangements made plans a later day
To hold- a baseball tournament and named the ones to play.
'Twas decided that one nine should be composed of players lean
' And that fat and chubby players should make up the other team.
The committee chose old Water Melon to wear a captain's cap,
. And old Water Melon said that he would drive the lean team off the map.
: Tommy Parsnip, slim and tall, was to lead the other nine,
And these selections, said every one, were wise and good and fine.
The committee named as umpire the Honorable Grandpa Prune,
Who didn't know the difference between a baseball and the moon.

With its wealth of dainty handiwork and things so very nice.
Among the fine exhibits was a quilt by Grandma Prune,
Which was by far the craziest thing shown there in many a moon.
Among the jams and marmalades that occupied great space
Were the best things that could be produced by the housewives of this

Won a prize and brought great comfort to old Auntie Sassafras.

And the /exhibits there were quite the best e'er seen in Pumpkinton.

: "On my plan . and with my methods an
expedition which would in all probability
reach the -pole can be fitted out for two
years at a cpst of. $150,000. The only ex
pensive item * In that outfit will be a
powerful, ship which sha:r carry me to
the northern shores of Grant. Land. We
have spent and . are spending hundreds
of thousands of dollars for an idea or a
principle. Taker a single example,' the
national^ yacht 'Â¦ races. ', A* reliable New
York paper said recently , that the cost
of the' last yacht races to the American
side alone was in , the â¢ neighborhood of
$900,000, and that *it' has cost us to defend
the cup in the last five years about $2,
200,000... . , . . .; ., , ; .
"For less than one-fourth. of- the- former
sum- and less "than one-tÂ«"htti of the lat
ter, we can get the pole. The ayndlcate
that 'lifts the pole' will have no successor
and. can never be beaten. The winning
of a yacht race Is a matter of to-day;

SOUTHWOOD. N. J.. Oct. 24. â As
suddenly as he disappeared last April,
wandering, demented, his mind a blank,
all over the country. Dr. Henry H. Cate.
the proprietor of a sanitarium here, has
recovered his memory. It all came back
to him while he was reading a medical
book in a sanitarium In Goshen, N. Y.,
where he had been sent several weeks
ago. Dropping the book he started up
and exclaimed. "I have been a physician
and had a sanitarium at Lakewood."
Dr. Cate then described what had oc
curred from the time he left Lakewood
on a visit to New York, where he regis
tered at the Hotel Albert. The day
after his arrival he went out for %
walk and did not return. His empty
pocket-book was found early the next
morning under a pile of lumber. It was
said that the pocket-book had contained
$2000. There was notning but the phy
sician's cards and the return ticket to
Lakewood in the pocket-book. Although
his friends had a general alarm sent
out for him all over the country no
word of his whereabouts was received
until he was discovered by, his brother
in-law in Poughkeepsie. N. Y. It was
said he had visited Norfolk, St. Louis
and Kansas City in the course of hia
wanderings.

mainly for want of proper foresight in
providing arms and equipments for the

trial, acquitted by a jury of his country
men, but in the latter he was sentenced

At 8 o'clock to-night the fugitive's
buggy was seen a mile and a half from
town. The pursuing parties were nearly
all together at the time and closed in on
the kidnaper. Citizens snatched the
horse's bridle, while officers piled over
the wheels of the vehicle and quickly
bound Castro. Little Adelaide' was by
his side and seemed much alarmed at
such an extraordinary proceeding.
A fast trip was made to Martinez and
the child was returned to the much-com
forted parents. Castro was seen in his
cell later, but would not talk of his at
tempt to steal the infant. He appears not
to be able to converse in English.
Wrapped about him under his ccat were
a number of pillow Blips and portions of
a woman's garments. . .
"He asked me to take a ride and I took
It," is little Adelaide's explanation of bow
the affair happened.
CAPTURE OF FUGITIVE.
A thorough search of the town was
made, but no trace of Castro and the girl
was discovered. Then the firebell was
sounded and the populace assembled to
ascertain what the trouble was all about.
The story of the kidnaping was quickly
told and a couple of hundred men were
divided Into posses to continue the search.
Buggy riding has its charm for even so
tiny a miss as Adelaide, and. she readily
consented. Castro jumped from the buggy,
lifted her Into it, and soon the ill-as3orted
pair was speeding toward the town limits.
A neighbor had noticed the departure of
the stranger and after a considerable time
made known the facts to persons who
were assisting the parents to rind the
child.
Four-year-old Adelaide Chatam. daugh
ter of a blacksmith who has lived here
for many years, was playing near her
home at about 5 o'clock this afternoon.
Presently Castro drove up in a buggy,
which, it was afterward learned, he ob
tained in Concord," anÂ«Ffftirttft!Pthe -little
girl to ride with him.
PURSUIT FOR CHILD.
The authorities for a time were appre
hensive, but the jail was reached without
more serious incident and Castro was
placed under strong guard. During the
night a larg crowd of men stood about the
structure, but no effort was made to use
violence.
Nearly 150 men, enraged almost beyond
the limit of respect for law by the magni
tude of the- crime and the audacity of its
perpetrator, followed the terror-stricken
prisoner for a mile and a half from, the
point where he was captured to the jail,
denouncing his abominable conduct and
suggesting In no uncertain words that
lynching should be the Immediate pen
alty.
PRISONER IS GUARDED.

an attempt to kidnap the pretty little
child of D. W. Chatam.

SAN ANDREAS. Oct. 24.â The particu
lars, have Just been received hereof an
atrocious murder supposed to have been
committed Thursday afternoon..
Jose Nandlna", an old Mexican rancher,
was found dead in his cabin down on| the
Calaveras River yesterday morning with
every proof of having been stabbed to
death While outside the house and then
dragged inside, where kerosene was
poured over the prostrate form and' ig
nited.'
The intention was to burn the house and
destroy all evidence of the crime, but in
this regard the murderer was foiled, as
the fire went out after burning part of the
clothing and flesh.
Judge Clancy, by whose decision the
mines of Butte are tied up, appeared on
tho street this morning guarded by two
Deputy. Sheriffs, with two others in the
rear. It is said Judge Clancy fears vio
lence. Attorneys for the Amalgamated
Copper Company to-day requested Judge
Clancy to expedite matters in order to al-,
low the caee to go to the Supreme Court
by hearing their, arguments on the ob- )
Jections to the bond to be given to the !
MacGinniss injunction, which shut down '
the Boston and Montana.. Judge Clancy !
said he was too busy to take up the mat- '
ter at present. . j
A report that MacGinniss had left the!
city shortly , after the decision of the '
Miners' Union to purchase his stock in
the Boston and Montana mine was .made j
known created . considerable' excitement!
among the ' miners to-night " and thou

A notice of appeal to the Supreme Court
was filed in the District Court to-dav in
one of the injunction suits that was
brought by John MacGinniss against the

ficers. This is one of the Cases in which
Judge Clancy granted an injunction

The resolution that created the sensa

.without a dissenting vote, was the one
objecting to the establishment of free
souphouses for the benefit oS the idlo
! miners, as was suggested by prominent
officials of the city. â¢- . . Â» r,
The meeting was orderly throughout.
MacGinniss and Forester bought their
stock in the Boston and Montana and

Boston and Montana shares costing $116
each. Their holdings constitute one-fif
teenth of 1 per cent of the whole. 1
SOUPHOITSES NOT WANTED.
BUTTE, Mont., Oct. 24.â An unexpected
move was made in the Amalgamated
Copper situation to-day when a proposi
tion was made by the Miners' Union to,
John MacGinniss, vice president of the
United Copper Company,' and his asso
ciates connected with the Montana Ore
Purchasing Company, to purchase their
etock in the Boston and iContana Com
pany. The union would ' then dismiss
the proceedings against the Boston and
Montana Company to the Â«nd that there
would be a general resumption *of. the
Amalgamated mines, smelters and -various
other plants throughout the State of
Montana. â¢ ,
At a special meeting, of the uhion, at
which about 3000 miners attended. It was
decided to offer MacGlnnlSs. and Forester
$500 a share for their 100 shares of the
Boston and Montana stock. Another of
fer was made for the 100 shares of stock
MasGinniss and Tamm hold in the Par
rott Copper and Silver Mining Company
at a rate not to exceed 5100 a share.
United States Senator Clark, A. J. Da
vis, acting in behalf of the First Na-
I tional Bank, and John D. Ryan, president
of the Daly Bank and Trust Company,
joined in a communication to the Miners'
Union under date of October 24, offering
to furnish the organization with sufficient !
money to purchase the stock at the fig
ures stated. They agreed to hold, the
stock only as security for the money ad- Â¦,
vanced and will not ask the union, to pay \
any deficiency arising from the sale of the
stock or any interest on the money in- j
vested.
Members of the Miners' Union figure
that the purchase of the MacGInniss-For
ester-Tamm-stock will immeditely* set at
rest all talk of a shutdown for an indefi
nite period. The shares they hold in the
two companies were the cause of the gen
eral suspension of work In the Amalga
mated mine, Judge Clancy's injunction or r
der having the effect of preventing the
latter company from voting half their
stock of the Boston and Montana Com
pany and the Parrott Company.
At the close of the meeting a committee -

union; Daniel ,Dqhoyan. u 'secretary; John I

: EXPECTS SETTLEMENT.
! Thousands of men stood in front of the
I Miners' Union hall- all the afternoon
j awaiting developments. It was thought
there would be an open air meeting, but
none was held. After, the. executive ses
sion inside the hall President Long ; mÂ«,de
a short address to the crowd In the street.
He said he felt certain -that the trouble
would be settled within the next twenty
four hours and advised the miners to be
on hand to-morrow night with their din
ner buckets.'
No one but men holding cards in the
Miners' Union was permitted to enter the
hall. What transpired at the meeting
was known only to members of the organ
ization, as the session was a secret one,
except what information was given out
after adjournment. The first matter to
come before the meeting was the proposi
tion of Senator Clark and the local
banks to furnish money for the purchase
of the MacGinniss stock. The offer was
accepted with little or no opposition.
A resolution was passed suggesting the
need of adeauate laws to meet emergen
cies such as now confront the people- of
Butte and the entire State. Reference is
also made in the resolution - to the ju
dicial officers of Silver Bow County, whom
the resolution accuse of bias and preju
dice in favor of one of the principal par
ties to numerous suits involving millions
of dollars. In conclusion the union calls
upon Governor Toole to convene an ex
' traordinary session of the Legislature for
; the purpose of enacting legislation that
will correct the evils mentioned as well
as for the purpose of trying and Im
peaching any public officer in the' State
i who may be proved guilty of malfeasance
i in office. :

Harry Westmascotte, who was carrying

knocked a revolver from his hands. Fri
day afternoon 150 citizens formed at this

bloody rags across a plowed field, finally
located the robbers on a wooded Island in
the Arkansas River, fifteen miles from
Burrton. A party of thirty heavily armed
men, lead by the assistant cashier of the
bank, L. A. Shiever, then proceeded to
wade across, while the rest of the pur

against them, the robbers waved a white

The Pittsburg incident was also ex
amined in its illustrative aspect. The
enormous "accretion of wealth in Pitts

THE PITTSBTJBQ PAILUBE.
The failures at Baltimore and Pitts
burg have not failed, i.owever, to arouse
an unrasy feeling over the possible con
sequences. The growth of trust compa
nies has been one of the most -notable
features of the recent era of prosperity.
The enormous consolidations of capital
of the last few years and the financial
operations have been widely extended into
panded the field of operations for these
institutions even among the lines of their
original operations. But besides this their
opinions have been widely extended into
the banking field by 'the increase of de
mand deposits, for which liberal Inter
est is often paid, while the legal require
ments upon banks for reserves do not ap
ply to these Institutions. Another field
of operations for the trust companies
which has been much criticized has been
the promotion and exploitation of enter
prises by., underwriting. The tone of the
discussion at the bankers' convention at
San Francisco is sufficient evidence of the
frank recognition of abuses in this field
among bank and trust company officials
themselves.,. The controversy between the
New York clearing-house and the trust
companies over the maintenance of trust
company reserves, has brought the ques
tion to the publio view long since. There
have been episodes In New York finan
cial affairs that have Illustrated the
abuse on the promotion side, including
the ship building case in the public eye.
The Baltimore example of the conse
quences of overcommitments by trust
companies In promotion projects therefore
caused a keen impression In the financial
world owing to the doubt of how far a
similar state of affairs Â¦ might be extend
ed . in the trust company situation as a
whole.
TRUST COMPANIES.
In the case of shares of stock it cannot
be said that the present situation has ex
tended beyond a marked cessation of the
recent persistent pressure to liquidate.
The week's events in the stock market
offer some indication of a contrary ten
dency to buy stocks on bad news. This Is
largely due to demand fronvan uncovered
professional short interest, and has not
been impressive as an investment de
mand.
London's uneasy feeling over the war
outlook In the Far East had some slight
effect on the local market, and there was
a repetition of rumors in circulation for
several days, which has as often been de.
nied, of an institution in trouble at St.
Louis. There was a deposit of $100,000 atÂ«
the sub-treasury to-day for telegraphic
transfer to St. Louis.
The variety of the demand for bonds
was as conspicuous as for several days,
and the number of quotations on the tape
for bonds exceeded in number and va
riety those for stocks for a good deal of
the time. A recession to 58 In Unfted
States Steel preferred was an unsettling
Influence at the close.
There is a general agreement in "Wall
street that the stock market has offered
surprisingly good resistance to the devel
opments of the week, which were un
doubtedly serious in their^ aspect. The ap
pointment of receivers for two trust com
panies in Baltimore, although not wholly
unexpected, proved a shock, and there
was a decline of prices In consequence
on Monday. This was the more marked
by reason of the considerable commit
ments to the long side made by profes
sional traders during the latter part of
last week, which were hurriedly thrown
back upon the market on Monday. But
Thursday saw a hasty repurchase of
stocks, and the bank failures at Pitts
burg were practically ignored in the trad
ing.
STRONG DEMAND FOR BONDS.
During the period of greatest depression
In the stock market several weeks since j
it was pointed out by Jacob II. Schiff, :
the head of the banking flrm of Kuhn,
Loeb & Co., in an Interview on the situa
tion for the Associated Press that a de
mand for securities was likely to develop
while the process of liquidation and con
traction was still In progress in the coun
try at large. There has been undeniable
evidence of some such condition in the
stock market this week, more notably in
the bond market, in which there has been
a considerable investment demand notice
able at advancing prices.
As pointed out by Mr. Schiff as likely
to occur, the prolonged liquidation has
produced some accumulation of banking
reserves, with resulting '.-effect -on the
money rate. Another effect of the pro
cess of contraction has been to withdraw
some of the expected demands on the
money market for which resources had
been conserved. This is true of the dread
ed heavy demands from railroad corpora
tions for betterment work already under
way. Borrowing of this kind at high in
terest rates was a feature of last fall's
money market. That it has not developed
this fall is corroborative of the evidence
from other sources that such works have
been greatly curtailed in all directions.
With the prospect of lower rates for
money, the rate of return on many rail
road bonds at present prices has made
them attractive for Investment.
NEW YORK, Oct. 24.â To-day's stock
market was almost inert throughout. The
appearance of the bank statement caused
sluggish recovery from early depression,
but the movement was merely fractional
and was. not maintained, the closing being
irregular and still very dull. The failure
of the customary demand from the "West
at this season has been the subject of
much comment in banking circles, but
that there should have been so consider
able a movement in the contrary direction
in the middle of October Is quitÂ© unprece
dented. It was suggested as possible that
local trust companies had made transfers
of cash deposits to the clearing-house
banks.

Diamond.
TMs tern Is cut by diamond workers with
a#xact number of facets as the genuine, and
Its excessive hardness causes It to receive that
high polish which throws the same prismatic
fire as the real, thus productnsr a luster and
brilliancy . which by far outclasses all former
efforts of science. Guaranteed to wear and re-
tain Its brilliancy.
The Sapph-Diamood appeals only to a class
that would appreciate a near- facsimile of thÂ«
real diamond at a moderate price.

he was the most powerful chief of
Southern California Indiana and fre
quently displayed great bravery In pro
tecting the white settlers from massacre
at the hands of Mexican outlaws and
renegade tribes from Nevada.
On one occasion he and his captain, one
Antonio, with a handful of warriors sur
prised a band of outlaws who were col
lecting In San Timote Canyon, northeast
of here. Intending to-inurder the settlers.
After a sharp battle Cabazon's band ex
terminated the- Mexicans, though with
great loss to his followers. Forty of Ca
bazon's tribe were killed . and many
wounded. Only a few years ago the
bones of those slain in this battle < were
gathered by the pioneers and Riven de
cent burial. All the pioneers and their
families have signed Cabazon's petition
for aid. ,

unheralded. About the time that he reach
ed Boston,, at 5:30 o'clock this morning,
reports came from- New York that the
prophet was about to leave America and
go with his wife to Australia, and Dowie
was kept busy denying his intention to
flee from his work ! and his followers.
Dr. Dowie and party were driven from
'South station to the steamship docks in
East Boston, and after the steamer sail
ed Dowie ; returned directly to his car.
There was no demonstration during â¢ his
stay in the city. He left for New York

to-day. There were about 150 of Dowie's
followers on the train when it reached
Zloh City. Of this -number twenty-five or
thirty were suffering from severe colds
but- none^ were In a serious condition!

of the restoration^ host were false The
statement was made by one"' of Dowle's
lieutenants to-night that 250 recruits

NATIONAL CONVENTION.
As the campaign had only fairly start
ed when the postal cards were sent out
and cyclonic "changes are always likely to
take place In the last week of New York
campaigns, the Herald makes no predic
tion.; It merely records the fact that the
canvass seems to Indicate that Low will
be elected. On the' face of the data re
ceived he will carry Brooklyn by 55,538
plurality and Richmond by 2463 plurality.
McClellan, on the face of the replies re
ceived, will carry Manhattan by 2004 and
Queens by 872 plurality. The figures in
Manhattan and Bronx, showing that
<3rout, for Controller, will run 19,000
ahead of McClellan, are surprising.
The poll was conducted jointly by the
Herald and the Brooklyn Eagle. Trie
Eagle canvassed Brooklyn and Queens
and the Herald Manhattan and the Hronx
and Richmond. Each paper tabulated its
return's and each took the figures and
made its own calculations.

r THE REASON. â There is no medicine
equal to Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Dis-
covery, for purifying the blood. It carries
off the poisons which contaminate the life
fluid. It increases the activity of the
blood-making glands and gives the body
an increased supply of pure, body-building
blood. It builds up the body with sound,
healthy flesh instead of flabby fat, pro-
motes the appetite, feeds the. nerves, and
so gives, to weak, nervous people vitality
ana vigor. .
"Afiouta year ago I had a very bad cough
and feared 'it would -run in\o consumption."
writes Hon. Geo. W. Lynch, of 57 Mason Street.
Worcester,- Mass. ' "When a severe attack of
coughing -would come on vomitingf would set in.
Matter accumulated in nose aud .my,- tonsil*
were irritated. After reading cf the wonderful'
cures resulting from Dr. Pierce's Golden Med-
ical Discovery Degan to use it, with some doubts
as to the good it would do me, I am frank to
say.- But; after I had used one bottle I noticed
quite a change for the better. Ordered five more
bottles and before I had used them all the cure
was complete. There is not .now. a trace of
cough or cold in my system and my health is
perfect."

IS FINED IN ITALY
Declines to Ask Clemency of King to
Escape Punishment of His
Offense.
ROME, Oct. :4.-Richard Pearson, for
merly United States Consul at GÂ«noa and
now Minister to Persia, has been fined
>60 and tlB costs for Insulting an Italian
railway offlcial last December, previous to
hlÂ» appointment as Minister. The Gov
ernment was desirous of settling the In
cident by pardoning Pearson but the lat
ter refuted to ask for the king's clem
ency, as prescribed by law.
Pearson, on December 2. had some
Â¦words at Genoa with some other passen
ecrs about eeats In a car, and an em
ploye of the road intervened, whereupon
Pearson, U is aaid, used insulting lan
guage in addressing the employe. The
train left and the Incident would have
been closed If Pearson on returning to
Genoa had not made a report to the sta
tion master against the employe, repeat
ing the alleged insults in writing and
tinning his name as Consul General of
the United States, thus compelling the
employe to defend himself. The .latter
used the Consul General's letter as evi
dence before thÂ« Judicial authorities and
Pearson, not appearing, he was sentenced
by defau't.
HALIFAX, N. S., Oct. U.â Replying to
& reference rc2<Se in the Canadian House
cf Commons by Senator Pierce of New
Urunswick to the possibility of the United
.Slate? obtaining possession of Greenland,
to the detriment of Canadian interests,
the Halifax Chronicle, the leading news
paper support of Sir Wilfrid Leurier la
Nova Scotia, advocates the purchase of
the island by Canada. ThÂ« Chronicle
ea ye :
"Unless prompt action la taken, â â¢
shall no doubt awaken eome dark morn-
Ing to find that our neighbors have en
compassed us on the east also, and that
v-e have another 'arbitration' to face. At
; 'u>. if we cannot secure Greenland by
purchase Tor Canada, let us have some
Ofinlte imperial pronouncement with ref
erence to it. analogous to the Monroe
Doctrine.
"The northern half of this continent is
by choice and by right British. The
Americans bought land on our northwest,
solely for the purpose of annoying us and
lessening the value of our country. They
ero quite capable, if unchecked, of pur
euin* a similar policy in the east. Now
Is the time to take action, or. at least,
to rpeak out a plain warning."
MONTREAL. Oct. 24.â Sir Charles Tup
per~ predecessor of Sir Wilfrid Lauiier In
the Canadian Premiership, returned to
Canada to-day after having taken part
in Chamberlain's fiscal campaign. In an
interview on the Alaskan award he said:
â¢ "The loss of Canadian territory Is due
p.!most entirely to the policy adopted by
Sir Wilfrid Laurier. If Sir Wilfrid had
maintained the position he took in com
pany with the late Baron Herschell be
fore the High Commission in Quebec,
when the proposal of the United States
that the boundary question should be left
to three arbitrators of the two countries
v;&B made, there would have been no euch
decision In the matter of the Alaskan
V-oundary. The loss of this territory Is
/Â¦ntirely due to the vacillating: policy of
P-ir Wilfrid Laurier. Before I left for
England in the early part of the summer
1 trxpiessed the opinion that the result
of the arbitration could not be other than
disastrous to Canadian Interests, and the
"award fully justifies the opinion that I
hÂ«ld. I am glad to see that Sir Wilfrid
l^aurier now proposes to do what I pro
rrscd to do before I left Canadian poll
tics, and which proposal I made to the
Premier across the floor of the House,
that is, the buildine of a railway from
Dawson City to the head of water navi
gation. What I proposed four years agro
he is now prepared to crant."
LONDON, Oct. 24.â There has not been
much comment thus far on Premier Laur-
Ws expressions of regret in the House
of Common* in Ottawa on Monday at the
fact that Canada did not have treaty
making powers. The newspaper head
lines refer to It ?.s a "striking" and "re
markable" utterance.
The St. James Gazette argues that "the
demand is somewhat unwarrantable and
:mj>o6s5ble eo long as Canada Is depend
ent Tor txternaJ defense upon the mother
country.** and expresses the belief that
the Canadian aspirations for greater In
dependence â ould be most practicably
realized bf working for the Institution of
a federation throughout the country.
The Globe says Premier Laurier's
"present indiscretion â to call it no worse â
if it stood alone, might be charitaJaly at
tributed to a momentary gust ef unpatri
otic Impulse, but upon previous occasions
similar ill-considered language has slip
ped from his lips and tends to cast doubt
on his loyalty and devotion to the British
crown."

-Owing to the visit of 'President Roorf
velt in May and the encampment of the
Grand Army of the Republic 'in â¢ August
the general committee, composed of of
ficers of the regiment and Interested cit

of collection of funds for the proposed
monument in memory of Father McKin
non to slumber till the autumn. The at
tention of the public was engrossed in
those unusual events and the city was
generally canvassed for subscriptions to
entertain the guests. The committee,
however, neither forgot nor neglected
the work in hand.
Under its auspices Capitol Council No.

entertainment in June at Agricultural
Park at Sacramento, on which occasion
the citizens of the capital city turned out
en masse as a tribute to the memory of

PRELATE WHO WILL ASSIST
AT THE McKINNON MONU
MENT BENEFIT.
Young Monserat was the only son of Ju
lian Monserat, a prominent planter of
Honolulu, and a nephew of Samuel Mon.
perat, superintendent of a telephone com
pany in San Francisco. He was 17 years
old and In the lowest class of thÂ« upper
school at Belmont, thl3 being his first
year there. He was prominent in the local
pports and was the fullback on the third
football team of the school. . .
Young Richter is a son of Dr. Erwin
Hichter of Belmont, and Mr. Reid states
that the father and son are utterly
crushed over the unfortunate accident.
He also stated that the boys were trying
to â¢ carry out his standing instructions,
which are that they shall not enter or
leave a boat with shells in their guns'
while hunting. But for the untimely
swinging around of the boat Â¦while Rich
tcr was relieving his shell no accident
would have occurred.
Three doctors, Bardncr and McClanahan
of Be!ir.or.t and Korris of San Mateo, did
all that medical science could do for the
patient's relief, but three hours had al
ready elapsed since the accident, which
occurred at 9 o'clock. Amputation was
necessary and the limb was removed, but
the loss of blood, the shock and the un
avoidable delay had been bo great that it
was impossible for to rally, and he
died at 3 o'clock, two hours after the op
eration.
The two young men, accompanied by
V.'ard Wells of Honolulu, also a Belmont
student, were Just finishing their morn
ing's sport on the bay and were removing
the shells from their guns when the acci
dent occurred. Richter still sat in the
boat, from which the others had alighted.
The craft Imperceptibly swung around
and at the moment of discharge his sun
was covering Monserat. The full load of
duikshot penetrated the left thigh of the
young man, fracturing the femur and
fearfuly lacerating the flesh.
The students were remote from any habi
tation and a high tide was running, so
tnat Richter and Wells had great difficul
ty in getting their wounded companion in
land where assistance could be obtained.
After binding up his leg as well as they
could they carried him by boat and in their
arms until a wagon was secured, in which
he was conveyed to Gardner's Sanita
rium at Belmont.
SAN MATEO. Oct. 24.â While out duck
shooting on the bay marshes this morn
ing Melville Monserat. a student of Reid's
iielmont School, was accidentally shot by
E. E. Richtcr, another student, and died
from the effects of the wound six hours
later. -

CHICAGO, Oct. 24.â A petition has been

It was brought before Judge Kohlsaat to
day in the United States District Court
here.
The application to have tho concern ad

was unwilling to act at once and the hear

petition was filed In the name of three
creditors, whose claims aggregate $27,000.
They cite several preferential payments
as grounds for making the application,
and make the additional charge that the
company is insolvent.
On Thursday last the Harvester Com- !

the hands of a committee representing the
creditors. The assets at that time were
approximately $4,000,000, and were believed

PETITION FOR BECEEVER
NEW YORK, Oct. 21â The Financier
says: The most surprising feature of the
official statement of the New York As
sociated Bank* last week was the almost
unprecedentedly small change of only
13000 In the cash reserve, there being a
loss of thjs amount. This seems quite
Inexplicable when the fact Is considered
that the trmceabl* movement* of money
during tho week showed an estimated loss
of $3,834,000 of cash. On the Inter-bank
movement alone the loss was J5.185.000,
and this Included the transfer through
the sub-treasury of $800,000 to Baltimore
and 11.275,000 to New Orleans.
It Is possible that the average system
may partly account for the difference be
tween the estimated and the actual loss
of cash, the movSment to Baltimore
through the sub-treasury and directly
from tho banks having been heavier in
the early part of the week, but that to
New Orleans was continuous, each day
recording transfers to this point. Large
receipts by two of the banks aided in off
setting losses by other Institutions. The
required reserve was reduced $514,200
through the decrease of $2,056,800 in de
posits, and deducting from this sum the
loss of $3000 cash as above, leaves $511,200
as the Increase in surplus reserve to $17,
Â£44.44-}. Calculated on the basis of de
posits lees those of 537.300.400 of public
funds the surplus Is $27,244,550. It may be
noted that the statement falls to bal
ance by $SS7,300, the total resulting from
the decrease of $1,166,500 In loans and the
less of $3009 cash calling for $1,169,600 less
deposits, whereas the decrease in this
item was $2,056,800.
The surplus reserve of $17,914,440 as
above compares with $17,751,475 in the cor
responding week a year ago. It should be
stated, however, that thÂ© surplus was
augmented in that week of 1902 through
the disbursement by the Secretary of the
Treasury of about $17,800,000 for bonds,
which' he had purchased with the object
of relieving the monetary situation. The
total reserve was thereby Increased $17.
063,100 and the surplus reserve by $12,
173.225, compared with the previous week.
Amonc the minor changes shown by
last week's bank statement was an In
crease of $129,400 in circulation. The loans
exceeded the deposits by $17,354,400, an in
crease of $830,300 compared with the pre
vious week: the excess Is the largest re
ported since July 1. The public deposits
show a decrease of $37,600. The daily
averages of clearing last week were $1S9,
000,000, against J1S7.OW.000 In the previous
week, and the clearings on Saturday, re
flecting the business of Friday, were $166,
216,137, or $23,000,000 below the dally aver
age. Comparisons of changes In the item
of loans show that five banks gained
$200,000 net, and one of these Institutions
largely increased Its discounts. Three of
these banks lost $900,000 net In cash.
Excess of Loans Over De
posits Is Largest Reported
Since July 1.
Change of but $3000
Is Apparently In
explicable.

Newbro's Herpicide effectively cures
dandruff, as it destroys the germ that
causes It. The same germ causes hair to

The detectives believe from the^r inves
tigation that two men who were living
on the same floor as Miss Jensen and who
disappeared â¢ the day previous to her re
porting the theft of the articles, took
them. They say there are two warrants
out for one of the men's arrest on charges
of misdemeanor embezzlement.
Fred G. W. Paige, who has a piano
store at Post and Stockton streets, swore
to a complaint before Police Judge Ca
baniss yesterday charging "Jane Doe,"
"John Doe" and "Richard Roe" with
grand larceny. The articles alleged to
have been stolen are a piano, piano stool
and scarf of the value of $350.
It is alleged that Miss Jensen, who is
employed in Robert Wallace's fur store
at Â£15 Grant avenue, rented the articles
from Paige about four months ago and
they were taken to her room at 617 Ellis
street. Since then she had paid $15 on the
instrument. About two weeks ago she
reported to the police that during her ab
sence in the country the articles had been
stolen from her rom. Detectives Dlnan
and Wren were detailed on the case and
they reported to Paige that they were
satisfied Miss Jensen knew who had taken
the articles from her room, but they de
clined to make any arrests unless a war
rant was secured.

PIANO DISAPPEARS IN
A MYSTERIOUS MANNER
It is also set forth that for the purpose
of carrying into effect the fraudulent
plan the promoters and their associates
caused to be selected as directors of â¢ the
defendant a number of irresponsible per
sons, who were under their influence and
control and who acted merely as dum
mies for them, and thereupon caused John
W. Young to offer to sell to the defendant
these properties in consideration of the is
suance by the defendant to Young of $16,
000,000 of bonds of the defendant, its pre
ferred stock to the amount of $10,000,000
and its common stock to the amount of
$15,000,000, making in the aggregate $41,000,
000. The promoters and their associates
thereupon caused the directors of the de
fendant who were under their control to
accept said offer and to issue the afore
said bonds and stock, in form, to John W.
Young, but in reality to the promoters
and their associates, and for the purpose
of securing the bonds caused the directors
to make, execute and deliver to the com
plainant the mortgage or deed of trust
referred to in the bill of complaint, and to
deliver thereupon to the promoters .and
their associates $16,000,000 of bonds, $15,000,
000 of preferred stock and $10,000,000 of
common stock of the defendant. There
upon the promoters returned to the de-
DUMMY DIRECTORS CHOSEN.
It is alleged that Henry T. Scott, Lewis
Nixon. John S. Hyde, E. W. Hyde,
Charlea R. Hanscom, Irving M. Scott,
Charles J. Canda and Horace \V. Gause,
the promoters of the enterprise, had the
several companies under control that
were afterward blended into the trust,
and that on June 14, 1902, they, acting with
the complainant and Daniel Le Roy
Dresser, president of the Trust Company
of the Republic, combined and confeder
ated for the purpose of transferring the
property of the various corporations to
the defendant for a consideration which
they knew to be largely in excess of the
market value of the properties of those
corporations, and for the purpose of
causing to be issued to themselves and
their associates for the stock and proper
ties of the several corporations stock and
bonds to whlcb they were not justly en
titled, in fraud of the public and the cred
itors, actual and prospective, of the de
fendant.
It is further averred that the promoters
named and their associates represented to
the defendant that the properties owned
by those corporations were of the aggre
gate value of $41,000,000; that the plants
were worth more than $20,000,000; that
they had on hand contracts for work
showing a profit of over $5,000,000; that the
busines of each was prosperous and
profitable, and that each of them pos
sessed current assets largely in excess of
its current liabilities and had an adequate
working capital, and that ajl of the fore
going statements and representations
were untrue.
CONTEDERATION AXLEGED.
s â¢
. Charges of extensive and deliberate
fraud are freely made In the answer of
the United States Shipbuilding Company
and James Smith Jr. as receiver of the
United States Shipbuilding Company and
others, filed yesterday In the United
States Circuit Court in the foreclosure
suit brought by the Mercantile Trust
Company.
Charlea M. Schwab and his associates,
the promoters of the shipbuilding- trust,
are accused of having defrauded the trust
out of more than $30,000,000, of having
elected dummy directors and of having
confederated to wreck the trust for their
own selfish ends. â¢
The answer denies that the bonds which
the complainant alleges were authorized
to be issued under the mortgage or deed
of trust, amounting in the aggregate to
$16,000,000, were duly executed by the de
fendant or were duly certified by the com
plainant or are now lawfully outstand
ing, but, on the contrary, it is alleged
that no portion of said bonds has been
lawfully issued or is lawfully outstand
ing. The averment is denied that on July
1, 1903, there became due and payable upon
the bonds the semi-annual interest, to the j
amount of $400,000, or that default was
made on the coupons by the defendant In
the payment of the interest. It is denied
that the complainant is entitled to the
appointment of a receiver of any of the
mortgaged premises or property referred
to by reason of any act done by the de
fendants or either of them.

shares of the capital stock of the Beth
lehem Steel Company. It Is alleged that
that stock was owned by Schwab and was
issued about April, 1899, and was of the
par value of $30 per share, of which the
stockholders had not 'paid to exceed $1
per share, or $300,000' in the' aggregate.
The 300,000 shares were acquired of
Schwab on July 1, 1901, for $7,200,000, and
were not worth to exceed, In August; 1902,
$7,600,000. It is charged that the promot
ers fraudulently represented to the. de
fendant that these shares were worth $30,
000,000 and that the Bethlehem Steel Com
pany-had, during the fiscal year ending
J>uly 31, 1902. made a net profit of $1,441,208;
that it had surplus current assets on July
31, 1902, of $4,001,018, all of which state
ments were false, said stock not being
worth more than $7,FOO,000, the annual net
earnings ending July 31 not exceeding
$1,000,000 and the surplus current assets
not exceeding $3,500,000.

According to the answer the promoters
are still holders r of upward of $10,000,000
of bonds, $9,000,000 of preferred stock and
$9,000,000 of common stock. ; The preferred
and common stock received by the pro
moters represented an : amount greatly
exceeding the value of the stock and
properties so transferred \ and | conveyed
and considered as full payment for the
properties. It is averred also thdf'the
$16,000,000 of bonds issued to the promot
ers were without , any conslderatlon,<and
were illegal and void, and the mortgage
executed to secure the bonds became null
and void. It is alleged that the holders
of the $25,000,000 of preferred and : com

TH^ VALUE OF CHARCOAL
Few People Know How TJseful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that charcoal Is the
safest and most efficient disinfectant and pur-
ifier In nature, but few realize Its value when
taken into the human system for the same
cleansing purpose.
. Charcoal is a remedy that the more you take
of It the better; it Is not a drug at all,' 1 but
simply absorbs the rases and impurities always
present in the stomach and intestines and car-
ties them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after smokln*.
drinking or after eating onions and other odor-
ous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Improves the
complexion. It whitens the teeth and further
acts as a natural and eminently safe cathartic
It absorbs the Injurious gases which collect
In thÂ« stomach and bowels; it disinfects the
mouth and throat from the poison of . catarrh.
AH druggists tell charcoal in one form or an-
other, but probably the best charcoal and the
most for . the money is in Stuart's Absorbent
Lozenges: they are composed of the finest pow-
dered Willow charcoal, and other harmless an-
tiseptics In tablet form or rather in the form
of large, pleasant tasting lozenges, the charcoal
being mixed with honey. '
* The dally use of these lozenges win soon
tell in a much improved condition of the gen-
eral health, better complexion, sweeter breath
and purer blood, and the beauty of it is that
no possible harm can result from their con-
tinued use. but on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician In speaking of the bene-
fits of charcoal says: "I advise Stuart's Ab-
sorbent, Lozenges to all patients Buffering from
gas in stomach and bowels. Â¦ and to clear the
complexion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat: I also believe the liver is greatly bene-
fited by the dally use of them; they, coat but
twenty-five cents a box at drug itors, and al-
though In some sense a patent preparation, yet
I beliei e * I get more and better charcoal ' In
Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges than* in' any of
the ordinary charcoal tablets." j

BERKELEY, Oct. 24.-The Berkeley
High School football eleven won the
championship of the Central Academic
League this afternoon at Idora Park by
defeating the Oakland High School eleven
by a score of 6 to 0. The game was full
of excitement from the kick-off and the
outcome was In doubt up to the last few
minutes. In the first half neither side
scored. Oakland held the ball most of
the time, but the play was nearly all In
its part of the field. In the second half
Oakland tried a field goal from the thirty
yard line. The ' ball missed ! going over
the bar by a foot. Then while about to
try another kick Oakland fumbled the
ball, a Berkeley man got it and, having
a clear field before him, ran through- for
a touchdown. The fumble was made by
Roberts, who let a ball that was passed
too high by Center Gage pass through'
his hands. Patton, Berkeley's fullback,
saw the mlsplay and, catching the ball,
ran to the goal line without opposition,
Shingle, the right end, interfering for
him. Patton afterward kicked the goal,

Dr. Tyndall's Lectures.
Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall will lecture at
Steinway Hall to-night on 'The World
Invisible." Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall has the
advantage of belonging to no special
creed or cult or Ism. and whatever- he
has to say about psychological research
will be both scientific and convincing.
That there is an invisible world about
us, unpercelvable to the ordinary
physical senses, is a hypothesis
that is Just now attracting the
attention of experimental science.
What Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall has to
say on the subject will be eagerly
awaited by the inquiring. Unprejudiced
thinker. The lecture alone should at
tract an immense audience. There will
be, however, a programme of fascinat
ing, mystifying phenomena In .the realm
of thought vibration, clairvoyance and
psychic impression, so arranged as to
make it an entertaining and Instructive
feature of the evening.

LOS ANGELES,' Oct. 24.â From . and
after next Monday there will be a closed
season for prize ' fighting In Los
Angeles twelve months in the year. As
a result of recent disgraceful exhibitions
of pugilism in this city and certain fake
fights, a' crusade against all prize fight
ing has been Inaugurated, which is al
most certain to result in shutting this
city against pugilists.
City Attorney Matthews has been di
rected by the City Council to prepare an
ordinance forbidding, under heavy penal
ties, all glove contests. If that ordinance
Is passed In Its present form prize fight
ing, boxing contests and all similar sport
ing' events will be barred. At a meeting
of a committee of the City Council to
day it was determined to Issue instruc
tions to make the ordinance as drastic as
it was possible to draw it, and it is certain
that elx of the nine members of the City
Council will support it and that Mayor
Snyder will approve It.
On tbe part oi those who manage pugi
listic contests there is almost certain to
be a contest In the court. Inasmuch as
they will endeavor to secure the recogni
tion of licenses already issued to them
and which are good for one year. The
terms of the ordinance will be such as to
revoke all existing licensep.
The penalty- provided in the proposed
ordinance will be a fine of not less than
$1000 for engaging in a glove contest, and
there will also be a section of the new
measure which will make it a misdemean.
or for any person to attend such a contest
under penalty of a fine not to exceed $100.
Los Angeles has long been a Mecca for
fake fighters, and numerous bouts^ have
been held here In which tbe result showed
that the fights were fixed and that the
affairs were simply intended to part the
public from its money. The result will be
that prize-fighting in Los Angeles will be
forbidden by law. The crusade against
pugilistic events has been carried on by
various organization*, lastly by the lead
ing commercial bodies, and with the sup
port of such the City Council is expected
to make it impossible lor a repetition , of
recent fake fights.

CHICAGO. Oct. 24.â The Lake-street
Elevated Railroad Company, capitalized
at $10,000,000, .was placed in the hands of
a receiver to-day in pursuance to a reso
lution passed by the board of directors
asking for the appointment. The order
was entered in the Cook County Circuit
Court by Judge Tuttle, who appointed the
Equitable Trust Company receiver for all
property of the company. In the bill,
which was filed by James Bolton and
Daniel E. Crilly, stockholders in the com
pany, it is alleged the company is hope
lessly insolvent and that this condition
has resulted "from the reckless extrava
gance and fraudulent conduct of Charles
T. Yerkes and his associates, and the
mismanagement of Clarence A. Knight
and his representatives."
The complainants further declare that
the purpose of Yerkes and his associates
"is to wreck and destroy the said road,
with the view of acquiring the same at a
sacrifice and thereby eliminating and cut
ting off the rights of other stockholders."
Yerkes and his associates, it is averred,
control a majority of the stock of the
company and have the power to continue
their hold thereupon through the election
and retention of a board of directors sub
servient to their wishes.
President Knight to-night ridiculed the
charges made in 'the petition for the re
ceivership.. "I should not dignify these
charges with a serious answer," said he.
"If the court proceedings are based' on
charges of mismanagement against the
officers of the company, then the direc
tors, who authorized the filing of the bill
are charging themselves with mismanage
ment, because they constitute a majority
of the board, and they approved all the
acts of the officers.
â¢ There hns been a threat of litigation
for soma. time in order to attack the
lease made by the Lake Street Company
In 1S96 to the Union Loop Company. . This
probably Is behind the present proceed
ings. The charges of mismanagement
were in all probability made for. the pur
pose of giving the .'court jurisdiction to
appoint a receiver.
"The allegations about .Charles T.
Yerkes' domination of affairs ...of this
company are also ridiculous. In 1901 Mr.
Yerkes practically . severed his connection
with the Lake Street Company and a
year ago he ," sold his ' few remaining
shares.. He has not now, a dollar's worth
of interest in the company either, In stocks
or bonds." In ' my, opinion* there was Â¦ not
sufficient' ground shown for. the appoint
ment of' a receiver.. We certainly shall
resist this proceeding."

RECEIVER HOLDS
A FAMOUS MINE
The introduction of men's corsets will
be attended with many difficulties. That
much is to be expected. There is preju
dice against it. deep-rooted, long-lived
prejudice, but its champions are certain
this prejudice will pass away.
Of course, the corset custom would
furnish the masses with new food for
ridicule, and especially would this be
true if the corset impaired the health of
the wearer. But it does not do this, nor
will it ever.
A man's physique can be trained Into
its proper lines by the use of a proper
corset. This would, at first, be a virtual
disguise for the figure, but what at first
will be a disguise will become a natural
form, and instead of being round
shouldered, flat-chested, and with promi
nently protruding stomach, the corset
wearer will possess the form of a real
man. more like the Romans or Greeks of
old than like our slovenly appearing,
stooping men of to-day. . .
Corset-wearing men have always been
ridiculed because a few fops have at
times affected the article and have taken
pains to make the fact known. In the
time of Queen Elizabeth there was a fop
at court who wore a corset, the purpose
of which was to compress the waist and
give the man an effeminate appearance.
The corset was more like a coat of armor
than anything else. The new American
Gentleman corset in no way resembles
that old atrocity.
Corset Has Coma to Stay.
"If there Is any ridicule to be pointed
at any one It Is at the man who does not
wear a corset," he said. "I feel more
comfortably dressed than ever I did in
the days when I was a-'scoffer like oth
ers. Now I unconsciously stand erect, my
chest, you will see, is thrown out and I'
feel perfectly at rest. Were there noth
ing else to recommend these corsets this
alone \ would Insure their permanent ac
ceptance."
This man is a corset enthusiast, and
yet he is a sane, sensible fellow, who
does .not run to fads or to ridiculous
things. He wants, and gets, what gives
him comfort, and that is why he is wear-
Ing a man's corset. He says it is rest
ful to the spine, that it makes him stand
rrect. step more lightly and breathe
deeper. Â» *
Corsets for men are not altogether a
new thing. In Europe, and especially in
Germany and France, the men in the
armies wear them. The striking, erect
figure of the European soldier can, in a
great measure, be attributed to the wear
ing of a corset. Following the lead of
the soldiers, many of the best dressed
and most highly cultured gentlemen of
Europe have found them comfortable
and essential. They 'have learned what
American men will in time learn, that
they are a great aid to correct poise and
splendid appearance. . â¢
Slonchiness Will Disappear.
But it Is not merely for fashion that
this new article of wear has been de
vised. The health and comfort of the
wearers formed the first consideration.
The same rule applies to men's corsets
that applies to women's corsets. Women
accept corsets as ordinary articles of at
tire. Though they sometimes misappro
priate them by tight lacing, yet any wo
man who wears a well-fitting corset will
say it never bothers her. but that It does,
on the contrary, produce agility of
movement in walking, and Is really an
exhilarating brace. For the new men's
corsets no more than that is claimed, but
just that much is claimed.
Now, these' men's corsets are not
aimed to give to men any ridiculous
shape or to make them appear effemi
nate. Yet it is possible to give shape to
the figure, but whether or not the form
is given a curve at the sides and back re
mains wholly at the will of the wearer.
The other day the writer met a well
built man who is a wearer of the new
corset. He unblushingly confessed to
wearing it.
Not Merely a Fashion.
After years of ridicule, Parisian and
other foreign makers of fashions have
at last decreed that corsets for men
shall become a reality. They are being
made and are being worn, and while the
adoption will no doubt be made with
some trepidation on the part of men,
they are, nevertheless, being called a
blessing by those who are daring to be
come the pioneers In making corsets a
regular part of their attire.
These men's corsets are the product of
an American Lady Corset Company lo
cated at Detroit. Mich. This concern,
whose name is known wherever corsets
are worn by either sex, has set about the
task of popularizing men's corsets,
knowing full well the existence of the
false prejudice and of the ridicule they
are courting and must overcome.
The promoters of this innovation do
not expect the Immediate arrival of a
masculine corset craze. Realizing they
are offering an article that for genera
tions has been held up to scorn, there Is
something more than sentiment in their
intention. They believe that corsets for
men are absolutely practical and essen
tial. They know that a campaign in fa
vor of men's corsets must be a campaign
of education, and that is what they are
inaugurating.
If the average man were asked the
question: "Would you wear a corset?"
he would throw up his hands and quickly
answer, "No." But that would probably
be because he knows nothing of the arti
cle, of Its uses or of its value. Many
men who said six months ago they would
not wear corsets are wearing them to
day and swearing by them, and declaring
the one great mistake the arbiters of
fashion have made has been in not de
creeing long, long ago that men should
be corset clad.
BAR HIE BOXERS
IN LOS ANGELES
PORTLAND, Or.,' OcL 24.â Upon the as
sembling of the Federal Grand Jury this
morning United States District Judge
Bellinger expressed his displeasure at the
publication in local newspapers of fairly
accurate accounts of the- \ proceedings
within the Jury room.
Since the Grand Jury convened special
agents of the Government who are pre
senting evidence in many land fraud
cases have complained that some Jurymen
were giving information to the newspa
pers. In his remarks to the Jury Judge
Bellinger said:
"The newspapers of the city are pub
lishing what purport to be proceedings
that have taken place before the Grand
Jury. Some of these publications purport
to give verbatim reports of the testimony
heard by the Grand Jury. If these are
true reports some person is disclosing se
Â« ets of the Grand Jury known only to
its members, to the witness and to the at
torney for the United States. By whom
soever disclosed, these reports have a sin
ister look. They tend to hinder the course
of Justice, if that is not their purpose, and
to bring the administration of the law
Into contempt- No such thing has ever
to my knowledge happened In this court
before. And if it happens again it will
become my duty to remedy the evil and
to punish those responsible for it."
JUDGE BEBTTKES JTJBY.
As Schneider has dismissed J. A. Sea
briskie, as attorney, who had been first
associated Â¦with him, the secret service
officers took him into the case as special
prosecutor and a thorough Investigation)
of the case was begun all through the
Pacific Coast States in which "land
grafters" have been engaged in business.
Seabrislde recently returned from two
months* absence spent in San Francisco,
where he met Burns, Pugh and three
other secret service officers working on
the case and wbere.be also consulted Bin
ger Hermann, who was commissioner at
the time the charges were first brought.
Seabri&kle expects to leave for Washing
ton shortly. Special Agent Holslnger is
now In Tucson, but he refused to talk
about the Investigation.
When they encountered Schneider they
found that he regretted having brought
the matter to the attention of the de
partment and they were referred by him
to his attorneys, who are also attorneys
for land operators. The only reason they
would give why Schneider should thus go
back on his former statements and re
fuse to give any further evidence, was
because he had found that a number
of his friends would be drawn into the
matter and at least one had threatened
to commit suicide if expcpr.ed.
Commissioner Hermann advised Colonel
Beabriskie, attorney for Schneider, that
an arrangement by which testimony could
be taken would be made, and S. J. Hol
slnger, special agent of the Land Office,
was sent to Tucson, where Schneider laid
the whole affair before him, giving In de
tail the plan of operations for years past.
The papers went on to Washington and
William J. Burns of the secret service di
vision of the Treasury Department and A.
B. Pugh, Assistant Attorney General for
the Interior Department, were sent to
Tucson to Investigate.
Seabrlskle advised .Commissioner Her
mann that he had a client who could ex
pose great Irregularities In the taking up
and disposing of Government lands.
Schneider had been connected with land
operators in California for a number of
years and was familiar with the methods
of taking up land Just before it was re
served. He had fallen out with his asso
ciates, and after coming to Arizona agreed
to expose them.

Into the operations of "land grafters" by

The conference did not take a vote on

Interesting Experiment in a Bestau-
rant.
An advertising agent, * representing a
prominent New York magazine, while on
a recent western trip, was dining one
evening In a Pittsburg restaurant.
While waiting for his order he glanced
over his newspaper and noticed the ad-
vertisement of a well known dyspepsia
preparation, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets; as he himself wlas a regular user
of the tablets, he began speculating as
to how many of the other traveling men
In the dining room were also friends of
the popular remedy for Indigestion.
He says: I counted twenty-three men
at the tables and in the hotel office I
took the trouble to interview them and
was surprised to learn that nine of the
twenty-three made a practice of taking
one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets after each meal.
One of them told me he had suffered so
much from stomach trouble that at one
time he had been obliged to quit the
road, but since using Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets had been entirely free from, in-
digestion, but he continued their use, es-
pecially while traveling, on account of
irregularity in meals and because like all
traveling men he was often obliged to eat
what he coud get and not always what
he wanted.
Another, who looked the picture of
health, said he never ate a meal without
taking a Stuart Tablet afterward be-
cause he could eat what he pleased and
when he pleased without fear of a sleep-
less night or any other trouble. . -
Still another used them because ho was
subject to gas on stomach, causing pres-
sure on heart and lungs, shortness of
breath and distress In chest, which he
no longer experienced since using the
tablets regularly.
Another claimed that Stuart's Dyspep-
sia. Tablets was" the only safe remedy he
had ever found for sour stomach and
acidity. He had formerly used common
eoda to relieve the trouble, but the tab-
lets were much better and safer to use.
After, smoking, drinking or other ex-
cesses . which . weaken the -: digestive , or-
gans, nothing restores the stomach toa
healthy, wholesome condition so effectual-
ly as Stuart's Tablets.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, contain the
natural digestives, pepsin, diastase, which
every ' weak â¢ stomach lacks, j as well as
nux, hydrastin - and yellow parilla, and
can ' be' safely .relied, on as a radical
cure for every form Â¦ of pbpr digestion.

Â¦ . â¢-
â¢Just one year ago today the doors of the CORDES FURNITURE CO. were
opened to the public. All that energy and enterprise could accomplish was
done to make that a Red-letter Day in San Francisco's history. The magnif-
ioent reception accorded us by the public then and since, ha3 more than
demonstrated that our declaration, "Your credit is good," was appreciated,
and that there was a field for a store with a liberal policy.
The year's business has far exceeded our fondest expectations. We
have been compelled to add two immense galleries to the salesroom on Geary
Street, making it practically ten floors. In addition to our present ware-
house at Fifth, Bluxome and Townsend Streets we have leased a warehouse on
the northwest corner of Fifth and Townsend, giving us enormous storage
facilities, though even now we are cramped for space for our mammoth stock.
â¢ We believe the phenomenal growth of The New Store is due to the
people's* appreciation of a progressive and liberal policy as well as our
untiring efforts to please, and in return we have endeavored to repay the
publio by giving them better service, better goods at lower prices than 'ever
before poseible on the Coast*
therefore, -through this means, upon this occasion, . our First Anniver-
sary, we extend, to our friends and patrons, the general public, our sincere
thanks; for their very liberal patronage and trust lo retain their continued
confidence and respect* '
With best wishes for' the continued health, wealth and prosperity of

The Mayor pf San Francisco who will be elected on November 3 will have the appointment of

Huntington and Harriman are again at war in the railroad field in Southern California' Each is
projecting competitive improvements and the financial atmosphere is thick with flying rumors of what
is to be done to advance the rival interests. The greatest element of compensation in the entire situa
tion is that whatever the railroad magnates may do in this kind of warfare the public reaps an advantage.
An Oakland Judge, sanguine, intrepid, daring, has risen in his might to the solution of a prob
lem of national moment. He has decided, without an if or an and, that all the ante-election promises
and buncombe indulged in by candidates cannot be held against them after election for good or evil.
While we knew th^ all the time, it is particularly consoling at the present time to have "a judicial opin-
MR. SARGENT, the Commissioner of Immigration, reports an increase of nearly one-third
in this year's immigration over that of last year, which broke all previous records.
Of the 921,315 aliens who came in last year 572,726 were from Southern and South
eastern Europe. Mr. Sargent "sees no menace in this alien flood, except that these immi
grants form themselves into non-English speaking colonies in our large cities, where, he admits, they
endanger the "physical, moral and political security of the country." In order to cure them of what he
calls their "radical theories of government and individual rights,", he proposes that the Government
assist them in diffusion over the country and in the acquisition of homes, when, he thinks, they "will be
come conservative supporters in theory and practice" of our institutions.
It may occur to others that it would be wiser to exclude this mass of ignorance and disease en
tirely, rather than incur the expense of inoculating the whole country with it, in the expectation that the
blister will burn less if spread thinner. The population we. have, by natural increase, rises by several
millions a year of native-born Americans. Mr* Sargent's proposition that by Government agency the
vacant land of the country be-ptit into the hjyids of immigrants in order to soothe them into support of
our institutions leaves these natives a cold prospect. How will he soothe their discontent when they
find their inheritance given to the stranger, in order to pacify him toward a country that he has sought
voluntarily, and^to which nobody invited him?
The Federal Government is embarking upon the investment of many millions to irrigate land that
will provide homes for three millions and a half of people in order to relieve the congested population
of our great cities. None of this irrigated land will be ready for occupancy within three years, and dur
ing that time at the present rate at which Europe is vomiting its "moral, physical and governmental"
disease and discontent upon us, we will add more aliens to our population than the number of our own
.people who hope for homes founded upon irrigation. What we want is not the laws for benevolent dif
fusion proposed by Mr. Sargent, but a law to shut off the supply of aliens until we digest what we have.
If this is not done the country will have something-worse on its stomach than undigested trust stocks. \
I3STOR.EA.SEID IMMIQRATION.
His pick struck through the flooring of
the corridor from which the prisoners
used to enter their cells. Behind these,
latter and corresponding with the main
one, ran, arid still remains, the little se
cret corridor along which eavesdropping
officers tiptoed to listen to conversations
between captives, for the purposes of
evidence, A few blows from the pick
brought to light the mouth of a pit.
Sixty feet down was waterâ thirty feet
of it The mason had happened upon the
historic well fdr which search had been
made in vain for centuries! It was as
perfect as the day that the Conqueror
sunk it. To-day it still carries its thirty
feet of sweet spring water, and should
ever the Tower be beleaguered, its gar
rison would still be independent of out
side supply. We have our holy wells
our miracle-working wells, and wells of
medicinal waters. If this historic old
shaft which tbe mason brought to light
were distant 10,000 miles, Londoners would
make pilgrimages to drink Its waters.
For ages antiquary after antiquary
found himself baffled by a simple prob
lem at the Tower. How. In the old days,
did the garrlBon g*t a supply of drinking
water? The antiquary could show you
the original fireplace at which William
the Conqueror wanned his hands, oould
point approximately to the epot on which
the murdered Princes fell; he could lead
you to the place where Henry VIII's
Queens were butchered, and to the tomb
stones that collapsed upon their poor
bones: he knew the tiny dungeon In which
Sir Walter Raleigh spent twelve dread
ful years hidden from the light; and
could have you In a twinkling in the
stone dog kennel where still remains the
ring to which they chained Guy Fawkes
But how these unfortunates and their
janitors drank, none could tell. The
Thames hard by was not the source, they
were sure. Organized search was 'vain.
Then there came a thick-headed, unlmagl
inative mason, to whom and his fellows
the work of converting certain of the his
toric dungeons into storehouses for war
material meant nlnepence-halfpenny an
hour and no more.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Many other Improvements have been
made, too. in the way of the dirt eleva
tor, which plows up the earth and then
lifts the loose red material into wagons
or conveys It to the center of the road
way. .
The convenient and economical handling
of stone in up-to-date road building de
mands not only crushers and elevators,
but storage bins as well, eo that the en
tire handling of the material may be ac
complished without the use of manual
labor from the time the stone is fed Into
the crusher until it is discharged into the
wagon or cart. For email crushing plants
the portable bin on wheels is now beinc
used almost exclusively. It has a capacity
of twelve tons, but when empty weighs
but 2500 pounds. It is made of seasoned
lumber, the bottom being lined with steel
and the 6tone discharged through auto
matic gates. It majj be quickly attached
to the elevator; In fact, the whole outfit,
consisting of crtisher, elevator, screen and
bin, may be set and ready for work in
side of fifteen minutes. In such equip
ments the thirty-Inch revolving screen
preferably six feet in length, is usually
used. When a larger storage capacity for
crushed stone is required, it is now cus
tomary to provide semi-pertable bins,
ranging In capacity from forty to'seven
ty-flve tons. These bins are fastened to
gether by bolts so that they may be taken
down quickly for shipment
may be transported with ease. Such an
elevator raises the crushed stone fifteen
feet from the ground, although the high
est point when folded is less than ten
feÂ«t. "
A. machine such as has been described,
when in use a? a traction engine, will haul
at least fifui-ii tons of stone over an or
dinary roa<:\ When desired for use as a
stationary engine in connection with a
etone crusher, the simple unclutching of
(the tlriving gear insures its Immovability,
and power can be secured sufficient for
crushing ar.y ordinary rock. Another ad
junct of the latest modern equipment for
road making Is found In a lately devised
and very ingenious dump car. with an
attachment for automatically spreading
on the road any required thickness of
Â«tone or gravel. The Etone Is dumped
from the crusher into the car. hauled to
tiny desired point on the road by means
of the roller-traction engine, and spread
over the surface undergoing improvement
Jnuchmore evenly and rapidly, as well as
much* more cheaply, than would be dos
elble by the use of men and teams. The
dump car may be so adjusted that the
sheet of crushed stone, irravel or sand
spread upon the road will be of any de
sired thickness from one to eight inches.
An engine tender with sprinkling attach
ment fastened to the tank, for use In
Sprinkling during the rolling process. Is
ttlso included in this equipment.
* Notable advances have been made of
late 5n the provision of complete portable
rock-crushing outfits, including not only
movable rock crus-hers proper, but port
able bins on wheels. The latest achieve
ment in this line is found In the rolier
bearins truck and folding elevator, in
which steel castings fcr frame lever and
Jaw of crusher reduce the weight, and
roller bearings for the truck wheels re
duce the draught, so that a crusher having
- Â«Â»Â«acity of fully twenty tons per hour
On the other hand, much has been ac
complished in the evolution of methods
to enable first-class road construction at
a monetary expenditure much lower than
has heretofore been possible. The impor
tance of this latter achievement will be
more readily appreciated when It Is un
derstood that many of the sections of the
United States most sorely in need of bet
ter roads embrace townships and counties
where the value of land and the financial
condition of the residents will not Justify
any heavy assessment on the taxpayers.
One of the most Important steps, from
an economic standpoint, has been found
In the invention of a road roller which is
also a traction engine. A permanent rood
road cannot be made without the use of
a steam roller and yet the provision of
ruch a machine, available for but one
function, involves a rather heavy ex
penditure. The new combination outfits
which have lately beep Introduced cost
only about half as much as an ordi
nary roller, and by reason of the fact
that the machines may, by the mere in
terchange of wheels, be converted from
road rollers into traction engines, they
can be used for the several purposes of
operating the crusher, hauling: stone to
the road and rolling the latter.
THERE _are few, if any, of the
many fields of activity in the
United States in which, during
the last few years, such compar
ative progress has been made and
such a large amount of work been
done as in that of road making. Yet the
country to be covered is so vast that
what has been done seems to be but a
beginning. We may hope, however, to
gee at no very distant day long stretches
of pood roads in our more sparsrly set
tled Western States such as they have in
the older and more thickly populated
Eastern sections.
Late progress In undertakings of this
class is doubly interesting from the fact
that the improvement is equally notice
able In two separate and distinct lines.
On the one hand there has been intro
duced machinery of great power and effi
ciency which has proven an Influential
factor in bettering the quality of the
roads constructed and at the same time
reduced the time involved in the opera
tion.

AUTHOR WHO HAS JUST FINISHED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
NOVELIST'S WISH, THE COMPLETION OF THE BOOK LEFT BY
STEPHEN CRANE, CALLED "THE O'RUDDY."
If he has been telling the truth about Rockefeller, instead of gladly beckoning his railroad to San
Francisco the Examiner should be pledging; Lane to keep it out, by the use of the police and all of the
power of the city government. Instead of the sumptuous picture of prosperity, rise in real estate, rapid
increase to half a million of people, and the vision of expanding commerce, as a result of the coming of
Mr. Rockefeller with a railroad in his trousers pocket to fling at our feet, rails, right of way, terminals,
Pullman coaches, dining cars and all, the Examiner should warn its readers of the sinister designs of
the Standard Oil Company, which is coming to turn their bread into a stone and their fish into serpents.
When did the Examiner get converted to the benefit of railroads to a city? Only a few days ago
it was upholding certain Socialists in Alameda in the attempt to drive from that town the one road it
has. It sided gleefully with the proposition that Alameda would be better off with no road at all. Then,
by what sorcery is it now convinced that every new road built to San Francisco is a source of abundant
prosperity? Now its campaign cry is: "More railroads; up with Lane and Rockefeller, Hearst and
Standard Oil!"
Every sensible man knows that there is no opposition here to the entry of the Western Pacific,
when' Mr. Rockefeller is ready to come, unless, when he is ready, Mr. Hearst turns the other side of his
Janus face, and trusting to the short memory of the people, proceeds to lampoon the Western Pacific,
as he has every constructive enterprise in the State.
The Beckwith Pass is the best gateway for a railroad over the mountains/ and there is a. vast
unoccupied country on both sides of the Sierra Nevada range to be developed by a railroad. But if the
Examiner policy had become the law of the State, no rail could be laid in Beckwith Pass. Only a few
years ago it advocated a law forbidding a California corporation to build a railroad across the line to
get out of the State, and also forbidding an outside corporation to build across the line to get into the
State ! It made that law a test of Democracy and read out of the party ever}' man who opposed it. Now
its test of Democracy is approval of Rockefeller's railroad and support of the Standard Oil Company.
THE Examiner finds it necessary to change the drift of business men to Mr. Crocker by claiming
that if he is elected the Western Pacific Railroad cannot build into San Francisco, but will be
shut out by the Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe. On the other hand, Mr. William Randolph
Hearst declares that if Lane is elected the Western Pacific will come sailing in on the wings of
the wind.
The Western Pacific has been one of the permanent railroad mysteries for a long time. It is
abundantly equipped with money and has secured terminal facilities on Oakland harbor and is seated in
other points of vantage arid its line is pretty definitely known. Whenever there has been any unwilling
ness to endow it with right of way or franchises it has been due to the lack of certainty of the bona fides
of the project, giving rise to a suspicion that it may be only a jobbing operation, projected to be bought
off. In this view, however, those with the most knowledge of its affairs do not concur. Such men
have reached what is believed to be the right conclusion as to its ownership by a process of cancellation
of the parties suspected of owning it, but who have, one by one, entered such public denials as to leave
no doubt of their good faith. This process and certain facts make it entirely sure that the backer of the
road is John D. Rockefeller.
Since he became associated with Gould in the attempt to get control of the Pennsylvania line and
oust Mr. Cassatt from its presidency it has been held as probable that he and Gould are together in this
far Western project." The great advantage to the coast of such a combination is easily apparent. We have
now no continuous through line to the Atlantic coast under a single management and ownership. , Pos
sessed of the Pennsylvania line from New York to Chicago, and the Gould lines westerly from Chicago,
the proposed Western Pacific in Mr. Rockefeller's ownership will join the two oceans by an unbroken
rail. The Standard t)il Company has interests stretching clear across the continent and its own trans
portation line becomes a necessary part of its business. With such a line Mr. Rockefeller can promote
the interests of the Standard in a variety of ways.
But what a spectacle we have in Mr. William Randolph Hearst pleading for the election of a
Democratic Mayor of San Francisco in the interest of Mr. John D. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil
Company! Mr. Hearst's associated organs of sweetness and light in San Francisco, Chicago and New
York have established his reputation and made him a candidate for the x Presidency, by . persistent lam
pooning of John D. Rockefeller and all his works and ways, and of all those whose works and ways are
like unto his. He has been represented as blighting all that he touches for the use of others in order
to convert it to his own purposes. Hearst has attacked William C. Whitney and libeled members of
his family because he was the son-in-law of Senator Payne of Ohio; an associate of Rockefeller. The
celebrated cartoons of the trusts, representing them with the paunch of a cow and the face of a baboon,
would be lacking in even Hearst's conception of a point if Rockefeller and Standard t)ii were not
prominent. < .

In the complaint that the physician treat
ed Mrs. LJndholm so unskllif ully that she
suffered great agony for four months and
was compelled to expend large sums to
obtain relief.
Just as soon as the ordinances changing
the grades have been printed for ten
days, City Engineer Grunsky will begin
his Helf-Imrfosed duties as arbitrator in
the matter of assessing the damages sus
tained by small property owners In the
vicinity of the propsed grade changes.
Under an agreement with the Southern
Pacific Company at the time when tho
franchise was under consideration In the
Supervisors' Street Committee, Grunsky
will have absolute power in determining
the amount .of damages to be .allowed.
This power was delegated to Grunsky at
the particular request of Chief Coun&elor
Herrln of the Southern Pacific Company.
The company, as well as the property
owners affected by the changes of grades,
is anxious that the matter of damages
be settled before the final passage of the
ordinance granting the franchise on De
cember 21. when the final proceedings bo
far as the city is concerned will have
been taken by the Board of Supervisors
in the grant of the franchise for the bay
shore road.
At to-morrow's meeting of the Board
of Supervisors ordinances will be passed
to .print ordering the changes of grades
on certain streets adjacent to the pro
posed route of the bay shore line of tho
Southern Pacific Company. The ordin
ance granting the franchise Is to be fin
ally passed on December 11.
How far, and to what extent, the public
stretts may be occupied 'or the purpose of
public meetings, la a matter largely regu
lated either by statutory provisions or local
ordinances. In this city we have an order of
the Board of Supervisors, adopted June 8. 1903.
which forbids the obstruction of a street or
sidewalk "except on occasions of public meet
ing." ' -. :Â¦
Unless the Socialistic meetings In question
are conducted . in some manner Â¦ violative Â¦ of
law ' unless they offend against decency or fo
ment violence, or disturb the public peace, or
otherwise offend against - some statutory or
local . law, it would - seem that the assemblage
In question Is not unlawful. Â¦
In view,' however. ; of the order Â¦ last refer
red to. and of the circumstances that the de
murrer confesses the Â¦; truth of the allegations
of the complaint Â¦; that the meetlnrs In ques
tion were not. unlawfully. conducted, tho ques
tion &s to the right of a political party to con
duct Its meetings . on ! the public streets of a
municipality does not arise, and cannot be de
termined upon this demurrer. Â¦
Demurrer overruled ; ten days to answer.
REGULATED BY STATUTE.
Following is Judge Hunt's opinion:
The complaint herein charges that defendant,
as Chief of Police of* this city and county, ar
rested thu plaintiff for addressing a public
meeting, on political topics, in the public
streets. The complaint charges that the
plaintiffs and other speakers in addressing
such meetings violated no law of the State or
ordinance of tho city. The prayer Is that the
defendant and officers of the Police Depart
ment be enjoined from arresting such speak
ers or breaking up- their meetings. The
plaintiffs and their associate speakers;Â»re mem
bers of the Socialist party.
The defendant demurred to the complaint on
the ground that it stated no cauee for the is
suance of an injunction. In support of the
demurrer it was argued that the plaintiffs
unlawfully obetructed the public highway by
gathering about them a large concourse of peo
ple whom they addressed; that such assem
blage under such conditions, was Illegal, and
that the defendant, in his official capacity,
had & right to disperse such assemblies, and
if need be, to arrest the upeakera.
The complaint alleges that during a period
of three months last past the members of
the Socialist party have been engaged "in ad
dressing public Â¦ meetings assembled upon the
streets of the city." ' ,
For the second time In the Superior
Court of this city and county have the
Socialists defended their right to deliver
speeches on the street corners. Some
months ago Judge Seawell decided that
street orators are acting within the law
In addressing crowds on the streets. Yes
terday Judge Hunt rendered a similar de
cision in the case of Von Braun et al.
against the Chief of Police. He/over
ruled the demurrer of the police to Von
Braun's complaint for an Injunction re
straining Chief Wittman from arresting
certain Socialist orators who nightly de
liver addresses on political and other sub
jects at various street corners.
Judge Hufit did not go Into the ques
tion of the right of political parties to
hold meetings on the street. He decided
the case on contention of thc plaintiffs
that they were not unlawfully obstruct
ing the streets, tho truth of which con
tention was admitted by the defendants.
He held that, in view of such admission
and because of the fact that It was not
shown that the plaintiffs conducted meet
ings violative of law or offensive to
decency, or that they fomented violence
or disturbed public peace, the police had
not the right to arrest them.

DAMAGE CLAIMS
TO BE ADJUSTED
C. E. Hill was appointed to confer fur
ther with the committee as to preliminary
steps. California literature will be sent
to all the delegates to the St. Louis con
vention, and a special train will carry
California butter makers to the exhibition
city, so that a fight may be successfully
waged for the convention of 1905.
J. A. Fllcher of the World's Fair com
mission explained the hope of the com
mission in securing an exhibit that would,
if possible, exceed that of any other
State. Mr. Filcher stated that California
will have a floor space of 8x8 feet for
dairy purposes In the refrigerator, with
an additional shelf space. The general
exhibit space for dairy purposes in the
California building is 84x13 feet. It was
suggested that this space be devoted to
the reproduction of an ideal dairy farm
in California. Both Mr. Fllcher and the
committee were decisive. that the exhibit
should be distinctively Callfornlan.
The committee suggested that an ex
hibit in butter of the Yosemite Falls
would be one of the most interesting ex
hlbits ever prepared. As the work of
j preparing many details for the dairy ex-
I hibit will be laborious, a resolution was
j passed recommending that the exposi
tion commission create the position of
superintendent of the dairy exhibit of
California, whose duty is shall be to co
operate with the California Creamery
Operators' Association and the dairy In
terests of the State, and shall organize
an exhibit and be In attendance at the
fair.
WISH OF COMMITTEE.
Hamilton Wright, representing the Cal
ifornia Promotion Committee, spoke of the
j wish of the committee to co-operate In
bringing the National Butter Makers'
convention to San Francisco in 1905. It
â¢ was decided that the Promotion Commlt
j tee and the California Creamery Opera
j tors' Association should begin an Imme
dlate campaign toward securing the con
vention.
The California Creamery Operators' As
sociation is planning for a representative
exhibit of dairy products at the World's
Fair, and also expects to capture the Na
tional Butter Makers' Association con
ventionâto be attended by between 6000
and 8000 delegatesâ in 1905. The conven
tion of the National Butter Makers' ..As
sociation for 1904 will be held at St. Louis,
and it ia hoped that the California ex
hibit, together with the work of repre
sentatives of California, may result In
securing this convention.
An Important meeting of a special com
mittee appointed by the annual convention
of the California Creamery Operators' As
sociation In Sacramento last month was
held yesterday afternoon at the office of
the State Dairy Bureau to consider both
the getting up of an exhibit of dairy
products at the World's Fair and also the
best means to secure the butter makers'
convention, which, if held in California,
will be the biggest and most important
agricultural convention ever held west of
the Rockies..
The special committee of the State
Dairy Bureau consists of C. E. Hill, E. T.
Fitzpatrick, H. F. Lyon, W. H. Ronssel,
Thomas Hodge, George G. Knox of Sacra
mento, E. H. Hageman of Fresno, Pro
fessor Majos of Berkeley and W. Hi Say
ler, secretary of the California Creamery
Operators' Association.
FltCHER EXPLAINS.
The Board of Public Works is preparing
to take up the proposition of treating
Point Lobos avenue, from Central to
Twenty-fourth avenues, with crude petro
leum, and will shortly receive a report
from City Engineer Grunsky outlining the
cost and method of the proposed improve
ment. The board will take action as the
result of a petition filed by the Point
Lcbos Improvement Club, which consid
ers the improvement a desirable one.
The City Engineer In his report will
consider the matter from three points of
view. The first will be the oiling of the
avenue for its entire width of seventy-six
feet, together with the admixture of rock
or gravel screenings designed to make a
roadbed almost as hard as a bituminous
rock pavement. The cost of the improve
ment in that shape the City Engineer
says will approximate $25,000. This will
include 'the thorough mixing of the .oil
and the screenings, together with the roll
ing of the same by machinery until the
compound has developed into a perfectly
smooth surface.
The second method of treating the ave
nue will De to oil the same for a central
width of sixteen feet in the same mannei
as the first method outlined. The City
Engineer estimates the cost of this par
tial treatment at from $5500 to $0000.
The third method suggested by the City
Engineer will be to sprinkle the central
width of sixteen feet with oil Instead of
water, and the cost of this treatment
would be but $600 yearly. Of course, the
same results could not be obtained as in
the other method, but a smooth and dust
less pavement could be secured at a small
cost.
The question as to who shall stand the
cost of the improvement is one for the
Board of Public Works to decide at a
future time. Assuming that the property
owners were willing to treat the entire
road, or even the central width, by the
first method named, it might be that the
city would stand half the cost and the
property owners the other half. Should
that not be the case the Board of Works
may expend the money now utilized out
of the "county roads fund" to keep Point
Lobos avenue in repair to treat It with oil
at a cost of $600, as suggested by the City
Engineer In the third method.

VITAL FORCE
"Is Crushed by Chronic Troubles.
One of the most weakening, undermin-
ing troubles which mankind is heir to is
hemorrhoids or piles. The victim is care-
less and neglectful of the disease at first
because the pain Is slight and the bleed-
ing may only occur occasionally, or he
may be reassured by the occasional disap-
pearance of the symptoms. And yet if at
the very start he had found a rational
remedy to soothe the inflammation he
would probably never have had a return
of this irritating malady.
Piles may develop at any season of the
year, and at almost any age of the vic-
tim; the abuse of cathartics often causes
this trouble and a period arrives when
the dread of pain at stool becomes so
great that the sufferer begins to neglect
the calls of nature and the bowels aro
either forced to retain the feces or are
only partially cleared, on account of the
suffering attendant upon a thorough
movement.
Before you reach this stage use a rem-
edy which removes the cause, ihereby
eradicating the disease, and that is the
Pyramid Pile Cure, which is sold by all
druggists at 50 cents a package; it is in tho
form of a suppository, is applied direct-
ly to the parts affected ajid brings about
a complete cure, quickly and painlessly.
A valuable little book on the cause and
cure of piles is published by the Pyramid
Drug Co., Marshall, Mich., and we ad-
vise every sufferer to send for a copy of
it.
People who have suffered from piles for
years are often astonished at the instant
relief experienced from the first applica-
tion. Another important advantage is
the fact that any one can use the remedy
without detention .from business or inter-
ference with daily occupation.
"I feel it my duty to recommend the
Pyramid Pile Cure, for after suffering ten
years _with a most distressing form of-
Piles, I am entirely cured, thanks to this
remedy. Any one doubting this can write
to Margaret Brady, 156 Whitman street,
Cleveland, Ohio."

Reception to the. Blind.
The reading-room and library for the
blind at Fourth and Clara , streets was
crowded yesterday afternoon, ' the occa
sion being an annual reception tendered
to the eightless by the Ladies' Auxiliary
connected with the institution. A number
of the blind of this city and Oakland were
present and the hours were spent in pleas
ant greeting. Mrs. Josephine Morris de
Greayer, president of the auxiliary, con
ducted the reception, and was asisted by
many other ladies. Some fine Specimens
of handiwork by the blind were exhibited.
Among them was a doll dressed by Miss
la Barraque and a model plow made of
metal by- Hans Hansen. The place was
artistically decorated, and after refresh
ments had been served the reception came
to a close.
The Presbyterian Synod of the State of
California, which has been in session in
this city at the Calvary Presbyterian
Church, Fillmore and Jackson streets,- for
the last four days, adjourned last night.
The reverend gentlemen who were in at
tendance pronounced the synod one of the
most successful ever* held on the coast.
The business transacted and the sugges
tions gathered will < be of great use in
church affairs and all present express
themselves- as having profited by their
attendance.
Much pt the work yesterday was rou
tine, atany committees were heard and
the suggestions they had to offer for the
betterment of religious conditions were
discussed and acted upon. There were
three sessions during the day. The first
opened in the morning with devotional
exercises and the last,. which closed the
synod, ended with a benediction. All of
the committees reported progress in var
ious affairs but some explained where
evils could be remedied. In the evening
three brilliant addresses were delivered
and after devotional exercises to-day the
delegates will depart for their respective
homes.
When ' the session opened yesterday
morning a sacramental service was held,
the moderator presiding. Then came a
narrative on the state of â¢ religion. The
report on temperance was then read and
the committee reported that much had
been done ln this regard during the last
year. It was stated that several corpor
ations, Including . the J railroads, had re
fused to employ men who over-indulged
in liquor and that such action had a de
cidedly moral effect. The report of the
committee on young people's work was
very creditable. This especially referred to
Endeavor work and showed little delin
quency and rapid progress.
RECEPTION IS HELD.
Soon after 11 o'clock a reception.to*dele
gates from corresponding bodies was held,
and reports of such delegates were re
ceived. Then business' affairs generally
were discussed and at the noon hour an

give him a farewell shake of the hand.
John McDermott Jr., for many years a
clerk of that big- hostelry, retired yester
day afternoon, having, as already pub
lished, resigned his position several
months ago. It was the original Intention
of McDermott to follow' his leave-taking
with an extended trip through the East,
but yesterday, shortly after he left the
Palace, he was summoned to the office of
Allan Pollok, the manager of the new St.
Francis Hotel.. A half hour's conference
between the two was followed by a state
ment from Manager Pollok that McDer
mott had accepted an offer of the posi
tion of chief clerk of the new hotel and
will enter upon his duties as such when
the establishment Is opened about Feb
ruary 1.
Mr. McDermott's engagement with the
St. Francis Company, however, â¢ begins at
once, and prior to the opening McDermott
will assist Manager Pollok in completing
arrangements for the same. Under sal
ary he will make a trip to the East, but
lt will not be as extended as he had con
templated, for the reason that he Is
needed here before the new hotel Is ready
to receive its patrons. "

after which came a report on the freed
men. Then the committee on Sabbath ob
servance read a paper, which was full of
Interest, and thc committee on systematic
beneficence submitted its report. Con
siderable stress was laid during the ses
sions on mission work, and the thoughts
expressed on the subject were many and
deep. The report of the financial commit
tee on financial status of the San Anselmo
Seminary was elaborate and well received,
though a deficit was reported owing to
the failure of some of the investments
made .by the church to realize an an
ticipated sum. v
At thc evening session evangelistic and
educational aff&lrs were discussed by Rev.

tion finally won their point, and a resolu
tion to that effect was adopted.

"The committee inquired into this par
ticular cose at the time of the investiga
tion, ar.d we were shocked that any one
should have removed such a girl from the
care of people who knew how to 'treat
her. Sha was ordered to be returned, and
that she was not sent back ln compliance
with that order was an act of defiance of
Ptate authorities that should be severely
cVaJt with."
FRESNO, Oct. C4.â Concerning the sui
cide of Rose King, the half-caste Mexican
C'-r't who was taken out of the Glen Ellen
Home'by C. Walter Gould, then a director
of the institution, and employed by him
as a domestic in his home in San Fran
cisco, where she killed herself, as report
ed m Thursday's Call. A. M. Drew of this
city, who was chairman of the special in
vestigation of the Assembly at the last
session, is very indignant.
"The board of directors of the home,"
he said to-day, "has been shown by this
unfortunates suicide to have been dere
lict in ita duty. The girl should never
have been taken out of the institution, aa
she was a mental wreck. The board could
h&ve got her back ln the home very easily
by commencing habeas corpus proceed
ings, and this is what ought to have been
dene.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Gall.
The Police Commissioners will no doubt
subpoena Rulfs to appear before them on
Tuesday night and give his testimony
against Sergeant Wolf. Lieutenant Glee
son denied all knowledge of the matter
when seen last night.
The records of the Police Commission
substantiate Rulfs as to the action taken
on the application for a transfer and the
subsequent renewal of his license. Ac
cording to the minutes the application
came up on September 24 and was denied
on October 1, 1301. On October 8 a license
was granted to Rulfs for the saloon at
513 Natoma street.
"The matter came up before the Police
Commissioners and was laid over for one
week, so the Commissioners coula com
municate with Mrs. Morris and ascertain
whether or not the building into which I
â¢wished to move had ever been used for
ealoon purposes. At the next meeting the
transfer was refused, and the following
week I secured a. renewal of my license
at the old place. Sergeant Wol? never
appeared before the Commission to testi
fy in my behalf. I went to the license of
fice to see Sergeant Gleeson, and asked
him about the money. Several officers
were present, and he Hskcd me in a very
peculiar manner to what money I referred.
I supposed that he did not wish any one
to know about the matter, and that was
the reason he spoke as he did. I am
ready and willing to substantiate any
thing I have said before the proper au
thorities."
"In September. 1901. I was conducting
a grocery and bar at 6-19 Natoma street,
and owing to the fact that my landlady.
Mis. Morris, refused to give me a lease
I determined to seek another location.
Alterations were being made on a build-
Ing at 531 Natoma street, and I deter
mined to apply to the Police Commission
for a transfer of license. I had in my
employ a young man who was a game
keeper at the Baldwin Annex. I spoke
to him about the matter and he advised
me to see Sergeant Wolf, who, he claim
ed could have the matter fixed for me.
According to my clerk. Wolf made the
Baldwin Annex his headquarters. The
affair occurred during the teamsters'
strike and I went to see Wolf, who was
on duty at the Mail dock. I v explained
the matter to him and he told me it
would cost $20. '
"After I had seen Wolf, a fellow named
â¢Young Dutchy* Hansted came to my
Â«=aloon and stated that he was the 'go
between' for Sergeant Wolf and collected
for all the crap games in the district. I
told him that 1 would pay the money to
Wolf. 'and he left- On Monday, a day be
fore the meeting of the Police Commis
sion; Wolf came to the saloon in citizen's
attire, collected $20 and said everything
would be O. K. There were two or three
of my fr'ends in the saloon at the time
and they saw me pay the money. Wolf
told be before he took his departure that
he would have to divide the money with
Strgeant Gleeson of the license office.
TRANSFER IS REFUSED.
ADVISED TO SEE WOLF.
The complainant in tnls last allegation
of crookedness that has been lodged
against Serceant Wolf is at the pres
ent time employed as a bartender. He
made the following statement of the af
fair last night:
Rulfs alleges that while engaged in the
liquor business at 549 Natoma street he
was advlaed to seek the assistance of
Wolf to. secure a transfer of license to
KlXatoma street, and that he made a
payment of $20 to the sergeant for his
influence. The alleged transaction took
place in the fall of 1S01. and Rulfs de
clares that Wolf told him at lhat time
that Sergeant (now Lieutenant) Gleeson
was to receive half of the amount.
â¢Young Dut<?hy" Hansted figured in the
deal as the emissary of Wolf, but the
saloon man, notwithstanding the alleged
declaiatlon by "Young Dutchy" that he
attended to all of the collections for Wolf,
refused to pay the money to any party
but the police officer.
John F. Rulfs of 820 Valencia street Is
the m*.v\ who claims that he was called
upon to contribute to the sergeant's ex
chequer, and his story tends to implicate
another police official and a well known
character who, it Is alleged, acted in the
capacity of "go between" for Sergeant
Wolf and a number of crap games.
Sinoe the filing of charges with the Po
lice Commission against Sergeant Reuben
Wolf, who la accused by a bartender
employed by Neill & Simpson of having
levied tribute for protection furnished to
the resort at Seventh and Mission streets,
another accusation of "graft" has been
made against the officer by a former sa
loon proprietor, who alleges that he paid
J20 to Wolf to secure the transfer of a
license.

10 THIRD ST., San Xrandsco.Cuban Editor Convicted.
Last night a gang of men were on duty
at 6 o'clock. At 10 o'clock preparations
were made for blasting. According to
the story of a colored man employed on,
the 'work, an electrician went into the
mouth of the tunnel to string wires. He
was followed by about seventeen or
eighteen Italians. The men had scarcely
entered the tunnel when three blasts were
heard, followed by a rumbling sound, and
down on top of the men fell tons upon
tons of rocks which had been toosened.
Seven of the men had time to escape, but
the greater number were caught and
buried before they had time to stir.
The noise of the blasts alarmed the
neighborhood and brought crowds to the
scene. Hurry calls were sent for police
reserves, firemen and hospital surgeons
and they responded quickly and began the
work of releasing the entombed laborers.
In a short time four baaiy injured Ital
ians were taken, out and two dead men,
but the others remained pinioned beneath
the rocks. Two of these, who were near
est the rescuers, were so badly crushed
that it was evident they could not live.
To relieve their agony the hospital phy
sicians administered morphine.
Another incident was the amputation of
the leg of an imprisoned workman.
Across his limbs rested a huge rock,
which was so heavy that It could not be
moved. In an effort to save hi* life it
was decided to amputate his leg, which
was badly' crushed.
The subway at this point is deeper than
at any other place, its floors being sixty
feet- below the surface.. ..;.- â¢- :
The work was in the Immediate charge
of General Superintendent Hunt and Gen
eral Foreman Richard Baers for the con
tractors, L. B. McCabe and brother.
Police Captain Hal pin said they would
be arrested when the work of. rescue had
proceeded far enough to permit of their
being taken away without hindrance to
the work.;
At 1:30 o'clock this morning three bodies
had been taken out and three more could
be seen half-buried beneath rocks. Su
perintendent. Hunt made the statement
that the list of dead would reach seven
teen. The work of excavating the bodies
will continue during the night.
The section of the tunnel where the fa
tality occurred is one of the â¢ most diffi
cult in the whole lin^, being built through
the Bolld rock. All through the twenty
four hours of the day men are working
there and progress Is slow. .. .
NEW YORK, Oct 25.â The total of lives
lost in the gigantic undertaking to pro
vide New Yorkers with rapid transit
know\i as the "subway," was materially
added to last night when a series of

ened many tons of rock iwhlch fell on a

LOS ANGELES, Oct 21.â A large two
story frame building at the southwest
corner of Adams street and Central ave

The supposition Is that the fire was

$10,000. The building was Insured for

WASHINGTON. Oct. 24.â The signifi
cant and Important feature of the selec
tion of Sir Henry Mortimer Durand,
British Embassador at Madrid, as Em
bassador to Washington, is the fact that
it Is the first time the British Government
has sent an Embassador directly to
Washington. Heretofore Washington has
been looked upon as a post ranking at
the foot of Embassies; hence it has been
the custom to promote a Minister to be
Embassador here. The action of the
British Government in this case marks a
growing sense of appreciation of the im
portance of Washington as a diplomatic
post. , , , . ,
PRECEDENT ESTABLISHED.
Durand First British Embassador
Sent Directly to America.
The two adjacent buildings on each side
were not damaged worth mentioning, but
this was due to the fact that the depart
ment put up a very hard fight and com
bated the flames before they _ could
epread.
The building was insured for $10,000.
This will hardly cover the damage, al
though the plate glass front was not In
jured. The stock of furniture was valued
at about $30,000, with insurance of $20,000.
This is practically a loss, for the damage
by smoke and water was great. The build
ing was stored full of goods and the
basement filled with furniture.
FRESNO, Oct. 24â One of the most dis
astrous fires that has occurred in Fresno
in many months destroyed the stock in
W. Parker Lyon's large furniture store at
about noon to-day. Serious damage was
also done to the building. The- fire orig
inated from electric wires in the rear

A SEVERE FIRE
Sir Henry, . who was born in 1850, is a
son of the late Major General Sir Henry
Durand. He married, in -1875. 'Ella Reeve,
daughter of Teignmouth Sandys Esq., of
the British civil service. Sir Henry was
appointed to the British Privy Council in
1901. Ho is the author of a life of his
father. Sir Henry Durand, and of "Helen
Trevelyan."
The selection of Sir Henry to succeed
Sir Michael Herbert was a surprise to
most persons here, chiefly because he has
never had any official connection with
Washington.
Sir Henry has expressed a great liking
for Americans and a desire to go to the
United States. His promotion comes more
or lees in the ordinary course of diplo
matic changes, but one of the strongest
recommendations which appealed to For
eign Secretary Lansdowne was Sir Hen
ry's reputation of being an excellent law
yer. A similar Qualification had much to
do with the late Lord Pauncefote's selec
tion. . . :
The .new Embassador will speedily bid
farewell to the Spanish court and pro
ceed to the United States without delay.
Lady Durand is not very strong, "but It
Is hooed that the American climate will
benefit her health and enable her to com
pletely fulfill her duties as hostess of the
British Embassy. The daughter of Sir
Henry Durand is much liked in Madrid
society. Their son Is an officer In a
Lancers regiment.
Sir Henry Howard, the British Minister
at The Hague and Luxembourg, and Sir
Nicholas O'Connor, the British Embas
sador at Constantinople, were â¢ among
others considered for the post, but Sir
Henry Durand was finally selected as the
most suitable.
While British Minister to Persia Sir
Henry was regarded in St. Petersburg as
being the most astute diplomat Great
Britain ever sent to Teheran. â¢
Sir Henry is an expert shot and has had
many adventures with big game while
hunting In India, where he was closely
connected with General Lord Roberts,
now Field Marshal, serving as his secre
tary during the famous Cabul campaign.
LONDON, Oct 24. â The Associated
Press Is able to announce the appointment
of Sir Henry Mortimer Durand, . the Brit
ish Bmbassador at Madrid, as Embassa
dor to the United States; to succeed the
late Sir Michael Herbert. Announcement
of the appointment, however, will not be
made until Monday, when the Kins will
duly stem his commission.
Sir Henry Durand left London yester
day for Madrid, where, at his own desire,
he will personally announce his promo
tion.

it appears that Mungla became infatu

Liquozone Cost $100,000
Yet We, Will Buy a 50c Bottle and Give'lt to You.
This company, composed of business,
professional and medical men of abilitv.
paid $100,000 for the right to make
Liquozone. That is the highest price
ever paid for the rights in one country
on any scientific discovery. It was paid
by USj after years of experiment with it.
because Liquozone alone can kill inside
germs without killing the tissues, too.
Nothing else can destroy the cause of
Liquid Oxygen.
Liquozone is simply liquid oxygen â
no drugs, no alcohol in it. It is the
discovery of Pauli, the great German
chemist, who spent 20 years on it His
object was to get. such an excess of
oxygen in staple form into the blood
that no. germ could live in any mem-
brane or tissue.
Liquozone does that. ,We spend 14
days in making each bottle of it. but
the result is a germicide so certain that
we publish on every bottle an offer of
$1000 for a disease germ that it can-
not kill.
Kills All Germs.
Any drug that kills germs is a poi :
son to you and it cannot be taken in-
ternally. Medicine never destroys in-
side germs. Liquozone kills them with
oxygenâ a tonic to youâ the very
source of vitality. It kills them because
germs are vegetables, and an excess of
oxygen â the very life of an animalâ^is
deadly to vegetable matter.
\ Liquozone is employed in the largest
hospitals, and prescribed by the best
physicians the world over. It is essen-
tial in any germ disease, for the cause
must be destroyed," and nothing else
can do it. Liquozone, then acts as a
tonic to bring back aicpndition of per-
fect "health, for oxygen,, is Nature's
greatest" tonic Its effects are exhilarat-
ing, purifying, vitalizing., It "does some-
thing that all the. skill in the, world can-
not do. without it . . â¢:'. % i -,','. ',." .';.>Â¦; \v
vGepm Diseases.
These are the known germ diseases.
Allthat medicine can do for these trou-
bles is to help : Nature overcome the
germs, and such results are indirect
and uncertain. â¢ Liquozone kills the
germs, wherever they are. and the re-
sults are inevitable. By destroying the
cause -of the trouble "it invariably ends
the disease and forever.

Inez M. Merithew, who became the wife

always a loving and dutiful wife and gave
him no reason for leaving her. .."'
Fetdinand Habermacher, a clerk, who
became a benedict only last December, is
already tired of the joys of matrimony.
According to the complaint for divorce
he has filed against Esther W. Haber
macher, his bliss was short lived. He
says that a few days after she became
his wife she began treating him with in
difference and contempt and* said things
to him in the presence of outsiders that
humiliated him and caused him to suffer
keen mental agony.- He also alleges that
she left him September 9 last and on the
following day addressed a letter to him
at his place of business, in which she re
ferred to him In the most contemptuous
manner possible.
. All such alleged conduct, says Mrs.
Paynter, caused her the most intense suf
fering. Â¦ She says she Is a. woman of re
fined and delicate sensibilities and is
therefore easily shocked. Her friends are
also refined and sensitive, intelligent and
delicate, she says, and she suffered be
cause they were scandalized when they
heard him refer to her as a pup. Payn
tar is also a drinking man, according to
his wife. She says In disposition he is
"morose, gloomy and ugly.'^and when In
his cups would think nothing of cursing
and reviling her.',
MEBITHEW LEFT HER.
Mrs. Bishop was taken el.ck in Denver,
in 1900,:,.Ehe says, as a result of the strain
upon her mind. In the winter of 1900,
she says, and in the summer of 1901, she
suffered from nervous prostration because
of the manner in which she was com
pelled" to live, and though her husband
well knew the cause of her illness, he re
fused to allow her to resume her proper
name. She was* so sick, she says, that
she had to go home to her folks in the
summer of 1902. She remained there for
four months and then returned to this
city, where she joined her husband. He
still persisted In compelling her to travel
under a name not her own, with the re
sult that she was again taken sick and
was compelled to send for her Â¦â¢ siBter to
come out here and take care of her.
Mrs. Payntar says that though her hus
band was very particular about the name
she bore in public, he was not so choice
in selecting the names he applied to her
in private. His common method of ad
dressing her was .to call her "pup,"
"idiot" and "fool", when. they were alone
and she says he sometimes applied these
"epithets to' her in '"the presence of others.
He' would frequently, she says, threaten
to kill her and often cursed her. Â¦
SICK IN DENVER.
According to Mrs. Payntar's complaint,
her husband's habit of cutting and slash
ing his name, and in consequence hers,
commenced during their honeymoon,
which was spent in this city. Slje says
she .left Brooklyn: as Mrs. Payntar, and
that after she arrived here he compelled
her to adopt the name of Mrs. ; Eugene
Bishop. He told her that because of cer
tain unpIe'asantrUs that happened dur
ing a former residence here he. did not
desire to be known by the name of Payn
tar. ThiÂ«s was after she had .worn it for
three months and as she rather liked it
it shocked her greatly to have to give it
up. . "When a few months later,' she says,
he adopted the given name of Guy and
compelled her to "'travel aboutVwlth him
under- the name j of Mrs. Â¦ Guy Eugene
Bishop, the blow almost killed her. She
objected strenuously, she says, but with
out avail. She says the very idea of
traveling about. the country under an as
sumed name worried her to such an ex
'tent that she became, a physical wreck.
She declares it cut her off entirely from
au 1 .iiitnus and relatives and - made her
feel like an outcast.
Just because Eugene Bishop -Payntar
chose to drop the name of Payntar and
travel for a time as Eugene Bishop and
then assume the given name of Guy and
tour the country as Guy Eugene Bishop
is one of the reasons why there was yes
terday .filed a suit for divorce by Dorothy
Brockway Payntar. She has no objec
tion to the name -of Mrs. Eugene Bishop
Payntar, the name she assumed when
she married Payntar In Brooklyn In Jan
uary, 1900, and she wants the 'court to
declare that such is her name, . but she
decidedly objects to changing it almost
as often as her . husband changes his
clothes. â¢ ,:-,-.Vv. ;-â¢ < -

Manager Brlgga of thÂ© California Stata
Board of Trade has sent out a circular
letter to fruit growers of the State and
to boards -of trade and chambers of com
merce In which the resolution recently
adopted by the board in reference to hav
ing an investigation of the fruit market
Is Included. The text of the letter Is as
follows:
'â¢The interest which the fruit growers
of California have in the thorough car
rying out of this resolution will, I think,
be apparent to all. It has long been an
established fact that with all the splen
did reputation of. California fruit In the
Eastern market, the readiness' with which
it finds sale, and the great wealth which
has been made by those handling It, the
grower himself has received proportion
ately but a poor return. . ;
"There is certainly. no lack of demand
for the California product and no good
reason for believing Â¦ that it should not
yield the producer a good profit, but there
is a pretty firmly established belief that
certain interests standing between the pro
ducer and thb consumer, have by man
ipulation of their varied powers and ad
vantages for their own emolument, work
ed to the disadvantage of the men who
by their skill "and industry have made
the State's great wealth in horticultural
resource possible. . .-...â¢ .r-

SCENES ON MOUNT TAMALPAIS YESTERDAY DURING THE EXCUR-'
SION OF THE VISITING -BANKERS TO THAT POPULAR RESORT
AS THE GUESTS OF THE LOCAL FINANCIERS.
"I see they hunt the records of candi
dates for many, years back. There are a
great many things that a. man does for
which he does not expect to be rewarded
and he does not seek, to be rewarded. I
am sure. If I have done anything. for thl3
State and for this city it Is my friends
who come forward and tell you. rather
than -myself. If I-have helped the Indus
tries of California, or if I have .helped the
workingmen. I did" not do.lt in the hopÂ«
of future reward or In hope that I might
some day' be a candidate for ' office, and
would use It*- for my personal, benefit. I
did not do it in order that It might re
dound to .'my credit. I never expected to
run for office. I am no politician and I
have no string of people to push me Into
office. If I am elected Mayor of San Fran
cisco I will be elected by you people. I
am your candidate and I will not be the
tool cf any boss or set of bosses.
"It is the people I address to-night, and
I will -tell them what I expect to do if
elected Mayor. I don't propose to have
a set of men say this, that and the other
party, and the other candidates on
the ticket. The reception tendered Mr.
Crocker evidenced his popularity in this
district. On his arrival in the hall early
In the evening the nominee for Mayor
was received with hearty enthusiasm.
Many of the citizens present knew him
personally and grasped his hand and
wished him luck In his contest.
The meeting was held under the aus
pices of the Young Men's Republican Club
of the Thirty-third Assembly District.
John D. Daly presided at the meeting and
fulfilled tbe important position in a very
creditable manner. In Introducing Mr.
Crocker to his audience, he told of his
generosity to the workingmen. He said
Mr. Crocker gave $1500 to feed the men
who were toiling on a boulevard because
of lack of employment in the dreary day
of Democracy, when souphouses filled the
land. In part Mr. Daly satd:
"I want to Introduce the next Mayor
of San Francisco, Henry J. Crocker. (Ap
plause.) You can talk about Mr. Schmitz
and yon can talk about Mr. Lane, but
Henry J. Crocker is the man.' While Mr.
Lane may be a good, square, honest man
and Mr. Schmitz is a fine man and I have
nothing to say against him. Mr. Crocker
has proven himself a public benefactor.
When the workingmen were starving and
were laboring in the park for money to
buy food Mr. Crocker gave his check for
51300. Is there any record of Mr. Schmitz
or Mr. Lane doing anything for them?
A friend In need is a friend indeed. It Is
a. matter of record that Mr. Crocker did
this and we find no record of the other
two candidates doing anything."
Mr. Crocker was greeted with cheers and
he had to wait some time before the notae
subsided. He. then took the audience Into
his confidence and told them some things
in his usual modest way, that gained him
many new converts. In part he said:
NO BOSS CONTROLS HIM.
THE voters of Ocean View crowded

cheered for Henry J. Crocker, the

BRILLIANT SCENE.
When Del Monte was reached all the
puests enjoyed lunch and then were taken
over the famous seventeen-mile drive.
Every vehicle in Del Monte, Monterey and
I.'aciflc Grove was utilized and on the re
turn trora the drive loud expressions were
heard on all Bides as to the beautfes and
charms of Del Monte. So impressed were
many cf ths visitors that a number will
rrmain here for come time.
Many .had not had an opportunity of
rrelrg- the scenery of California as the
overland trains on which they came from
the East passed through California at
right. Everything possible was done to
make the excursion trip a great success.
On the train coming down there were
flowers, refreshments and fruits in large
Q-iantlties and points of Interest were
explained by members of the reception
tommittee. The train stepped ten minutes
?.t San Joee and the citizens there sent
1-resents of fruits s.nd flowers to the train.
DEL MONTE. Oct. 24.â More than 200
visitors to Del Monte were entertained
here to-fiay as the guests of the bankers
.of California, the guests comprising dele

The eun had not been long up when
FpeeJal trains bearing the distinguished
quests rolled away on widely diverging
lines and the fields and vineyards, valleys

flowers for the enjoyment of the strang
ers.
At the Attl colony vineyards in Sonoma

smacked lips over the rare wines that
have added to the fame of California.
They caw the picturesque Sonoma Val

end the excursionists thoroughly enjoyed
the trip.
The romantic beauties of Old Monterey
contributed to the enjoyment of another
party. Del Monte was the headquarter*
of the party, which will return to this
city this morning.
The New York bankers, traveling on
their famous "train <Ie luxe," also visited
Monterey and before leaving the State
uJll stop at Los Angeles and Santa Bar

â¢the grand panorama that stretches on
every side. They will long remember the
tr^at. Stanford I'nSvttsity and San Jose
were inspected by still another delegation
that returned to this city last evening.
Expressions cf appreciation for the
courtesies extendc-d the bankers were
voiced by them on every side, though
their appreciation of California hospitality

with. Initial steps for the formation of
the league were taken early in the cam
paign and it was then resolved that the
powerful strength, .of . the organization
should be cast for a. candidate who could
defeat Ruef's man Schmitz and give to
the city "a: creditable administration of
municipal affairs. . From . day to day the
league increased in membership... The
trend of campaign events clearly^ demon
strated to the workingmen that Crocker's
prospects of success were steadily grow
ing brighter, while Lane's chance was
not much more than a remote \ glimmer.
Moreover, Henry J. Crocker's record was
carefully and impartially reviewed. The
result of the investigation is a declaration
upon the part of a very large and influ
ential army of workingmen that the Re
publican nominee should be elected Mayor
of San . Francisco. The reasons for the
supreme . confidence . of the Republican
Campaign Committee, as to the result of
the election are now obvious.
OFFICERS OF LEAGUE.
THE great swing of voting strength
to Henry J. Crocker Is taking
place. Yesterday the Henry- J.
' Crocker Worklngmen's League,
It was stated in the circular that nine
tenths of the teachers must sign the new
1 agreement to make it binding. The Board
of Education was much chagrined to find
later. than less'than one-half of the teach
ers in the, department were willinc to
double their contribution and the, plan
fell through. Now the result will be that
the annuitants 'will' suffer a, loss of $5 or
perhaps $10 in their monthly . annuity:
There is no remedy for the case, either,
except iri the manner outlined in the cir
cular issued by. the. board.
The report of the ' City Treasurer for
the quarter ending September 30, which
has Just been made public, shows ' the
actual condition of 'the fund, the greater
portion of which is' in the permanent
fund and cannot be "used to pay annui
ties until it amounts to $50,000,. and then
only the interest thereon can be applied
to annuities. .The figures follow:

A serious condition confronts the teach
ers of the Pubilc School Department who
have been retired on annuities, Â¦ for the
reason that at thÂ« present rate of ex
penditures for the purpose a deficit is im
â¢pendlng, which will compel a , material
reduction In the amount paid monthly to
each individual annuitant. The situation
was not improved by the fact that at a
meeting of tb^e Teachers' Annuity and
Retirement Committee held ... yesterday
Miss Laicrezia. Burnham of 'the Horace
Mann School was at her own request rec
ommended to the Board of Education for
retirement on an annuity.
With Miss Burnham's retirement there
are forty _ teachers who are now paid
monthly annuities. Twenty-eight, of
these are paid the maximum of $30 per
month and twelve are paid various
amounts based on a pro rata for services
rendered, they not having served the full
period of thirty years In order to be en
titled to the maximum annuity.
The teachers in the School Department
to a number of S39 pay the sum of $1
monthly each' for t the support' of the an
nuity fund. Three-fourths of this sum
is used to pay annuities and the other
fourth goes into a permanent fund, which
has been limited to. the Bum of $50,000.
The monthly incom^ which can be util
ized for the payment of annuities is there
fore # but $704 25, which, with interest from
moneys In bank, is Increased to $931 35,
but this sum. 'Is inadequate to- pay 'the
annuities of the forty teachers . on the
list, as tbÂ® permanent fund -cannot. -be
irseft"for. tH&rpirtposeV. Â¦ : ~. t% ,~ ' â¢'. :
MUST REDTJCE ANNTTITIES.
The Teachers' Retirement and Annuity
Fund ConxmiS6loners, composed of Mayor
Schmitz, Treasurer. McDougald and Su
perintendent of Schools I I^angdon, are
consequently 1 confronted with the dis
agreeable duty of reducing CTie annuities
of the retired teachers in order to. bring
the total expenditures within the income.
It is almpst certain Hhat unless the ac
tive teachers themselves come to the res
cue the maximum annuity that can be
allowed in future will be but $25 monthly
and may go as low as $20. Those who are
drawing a pro rata for services rendered
will experience a corresponding reduc
tion in their annuities, owing to the def
icit in the fund.
OnÂ© reason why the income is not suf
ficient to ' pay the maximum pension al
lowed by, law is due',to.the fact that 134
teachers in- the department do not pay
their 'monthly duesvbf T$l into the fund.
The sum so cellected would be sufficient
to pay nearly \ five annuitants. Some
time ago. the Board of Education, fully
alive to the prospective deficit, issued a
circular calling o"n the active teachers to
contribute $2 monthly: to the fund Instead
of $1. \ This would create an income (with
939 teachers. contributing) of $140S CO to the
annuity fund and $469 50 to the perma
nent fund every month. The* first named
sum would be more than sufficient to pay
each annuitant the 'maximum annuity.

HOLDS PACKED MEETING.
Mayor Schmitz Addresses Voters at
Duveneck's Hall.
Mayor Schmitz spoke to a packed meet
ing of Union Labor party men last night
at Duveneck's Hall, 3008 Twenty-fourth
street. The meeting was highly enthus
iastic and when the Mayor appeared It
was several minutes before the cheering
subsided sufficiently for him to be heard.
He spoke in the usual vein of his cam
paign orations, pointing to the fact that
Industrial lines during his administration
had been peculiarly prosperous. He re
verted to the increase in building opera
tions, with the increased wages accru
ing to men engaged' in that occupation
and assured his hearers that his election
presaged a continuation of the present
conditions.
He emphasized his position of trying to
act as an intermediary between employer
and employe, stating that his <fiim had
been not to uphold the laborer in unjust
contentions, but to adjudicate disputes
with the single idea of justice to both
sides and claimed that during his admin
istration he had succeeded in settling
many important strikes by bringing the
contending parties to an equitable basis
of understanding.
Nearly all of the candidates on the
Union Labor ticket preceded the Mayor
with short addresses. An attempt was
made to continue the meeting after he
had finished, but the great majority of
the crowd followed him out of the hall.
Eyton Will Beferee the Fight.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 24. â The advance
sale for the Johnson-McVey fight Tues
day night has been unprecedented and
Manager McCarcy expects a $10,000
house. All the best seats in the house
have been sold. The betting thus far has
been light. . A, few small wagers were
made to-day at odds of 10 to 8, Charles
Ejton has been chosen referee.
ENTHUSIASM HI CROCKER MEETINGS
Lane cannot draw support from the
ranks of the workmen of San Francisco,
but Henry J. Crocker has successfully
invaded the labor field. Intelligence of
the organization of the Henry J. Crocker
Workingmen's League creates consterna
tion in the camp of Schmitz and Ruef.
Thousands of active workingmen have al
ready Joined the league.
In search of political support Lane next
turned to the liberal German element of
citizenship. He attended a German social
gathering at Eintracht Hall one Sunday
evening. Mayor Schmitz also attended
the same meeting. Both candidates were
introduced to the audience. Schmitz was
greeted with marked cordiality. Lane's
appearance did not evoke applause. When
his name was mentioned the silence was
almost oppressive. Candidate Lane, per
ceiving that he must look elsewhere for
enthusiastic support, turned his attention
to the Ministerial Union, and. now, with
the moral influence of the McNab morn
ing-press behind him, he is soliciting the
indorsement of local clergymen.
There may be some .Democrats of the
Ingenuous sort who entertain the notion
that Lane possesses positive strength'. If
they want to know the truth concerning
Lane's chances, let them ask what As
sembly district he can carry. The Repub
licans will win in the Thirty-fourth,
Thirty-fifth, Thirty-seventh, Thirty
eighth, Thirty-ninth, Fortieth, Forty
first, Forty-second and Forty-third.
Schm'tz is stronger than Lane in the
Twenty- ninths . Thirtieth, ' Thirty-first,
Thirty-second and F.orty'-flfth.' There is
Just a possibility that Lane may carry
the Twenty-eighth District, as Boss Mar
tin Kelly is behind him.
When the clergymen indorse Lane they
will of course include Kelly in the" in
dorsement, because no one stands in
greater need of a clean bill of moral
health than Lane's chief lieutenant, Boss
Martin Kelly of the old Twenty-eighth.
The boss has possession of the old roll
of the Republican Mutual Alliance, and it
is understood that he is ready to use it
as a campaign document and publish the
names thereon as supporters of the Demo
cratic nominee for Mayor. It Is. common
knowledge that the Alliance and the Pri
mary League were consolidated into the
United .Republican League. The only
thing left for Boss Kelly was the roll of
membership, and he Is quite at liberty to
present the same to Candidate Lane.
Sam Rainey cannot very well Join hlB
old partner Kelly in presenting this testi
monial of boss esteem to Franklin Kandl
date Lane, because the enterprising
Samuel is doing Fire Department politics
for Ruefs versatile friend, Mayor
Schmitz.
Lane is weak and is getting weaker.
Early in the campaign his supporters ad
vertised that a Lane Union\ Labor club
would be organized at Turk-street Tem
ple. On the night appointed for the or
ganization Lane expected a large audi
ence, but by actual count only twenty
men attended. The. raid on Schmitz's
forces was a failure. No other effort has
been made by Lane's manager to organize
a labor club.
The Call is in possession of trustworthy
information that the union labor men.are
not deserting their own party and going
back to the Democratic camp. Such talk
is McNab buncombe. The Schmitz follow
ing is still formidable. The Mayor him
self Is appealing to class prejudice for
support .
and the "whirlwind finish" for
Lane do not diminish the odds In Crock
er's favor. The Republican campaign
committee, W. J. Dutton chairman, holds
daily sessions. The committee is In con
stant touch with the party workers in
every district of San Francisco. The in
formation brought to headquarters con
vinces the committee that the fight for
Crocker is already won. A member of
the committee remarked yesterday: "We
know that Crocker will be elected. The
battle is won, but this knowledge will not
cause any cessation of work on behalf of
the ticket, We are also of the opinion
that Henry H. Lynch will win in the
hard fight for Sheriff, and that Judge
Bahrs will succeed Dr. Dodge in the As
sessor's office. Positive information is at
hand that many Democrats of prom
inence and influence are lending their sup
port to Henry J. Crocker. There are sev
eral good and sufficient reasons why we
tfo not give out the Democratic list for
publication." ' "
HENRY J. CROCKER, Republican
nominee for Mayor, is slated as
the winner by the betting frater
nity. The shouting for Schmitz
palgn purposes and gladly turned it over
to him. Mr. Daly's indorsement of Ash
er*s action earned the latter a'great deal
of applause when he appeared before the
crowd. Asher made a good talk and was
promised many votes from the residents
of Ocean View.

Voting Machines.
} The Registrar will have' on exhibition
; in 'his office on Wednesday a voting ma
chine which has been perrected for use
| in r San Francisco. -There has been some
doubt as to the . possibility of arranging
a machine that would permit of voters
making a selection 'of eighteen Super
visors at will from seventy-two nominees,
but this obstacle has been overcome. v The
Board of Election Commissioners had
hoped to use the voting machines at the
municipal election, November 3, 1903, but
the fact of their not being available for
the selection of the numt>er of Super
visors to be elected prevented their use.
Now that this obstacle is removed they
hope to have them, in operation at the
Presidential election in 1904, and in all
future elections, introducing them grad
ually throughout the city. On election
day, 'November 3, 1903, the election depart
ment-will Â¦ have the machine in a booth
on, Hyde street, near the City Hall, with
a staff of clerks to explain , the working
of the same. The representatives of the
press and the;^Merchants' Association
and citizens generally who are interested
in this remarkable improvement ' on" the
present methods of voting will have â¢ an
opportunity to learn its utility. â¢

"A Union Labor party was formed two
years ago at a convention composed cf
representatives from various labor or

"Our duty is plain. We must cast from
our municipal temple the money grabbing

E. Schmitz, who is Ruefs partner, and
we must scatter the band of 'grafters'
that have helped to make the Schmitz-
Ruef administration Fmell to heaven.
With increased power and with Ruef
owning all the commissions, the number
of thes<> 'grafters' will Increase and mul
tiply. The public is familiar with the
Men-hon scandal; the public knows all
about the scandal which is linked to the
name of Parry, the doormat of Abe Ruef;
the public knows who drove out Mahoney
end who appointed Drinkhouse to the Po
lice Commission. Return Abe Ruef to
power and there will be a repetition all
down the line of the scandalous appoint
ments. Do the citizens of San Francisco
want an exaggeration of the Mershon.
the Parry and the Drinkhouse scandals?
Thes-e appointments are only the enter
ing wedge to the grand system of 'graft'
that has crowned St. Louis and Minne
apolis with Infamy.
"Of the twenty-two Ruef appointees
only four or five are union men: the oth
ers never saw a union and never did any
thing for the union cause. And yet on
the Schmitz banners we read the words
"Trifd and true." True to whom? To
the unions? Surely not. if we can reach
any conclusion from the list of ap
pointees. To whom then is Schmitz true?
To Abe Ruef. who is bending all his en

system that will make the 'grafters' of

accomplish this end, we must elect Henry
J. Crocker.
"But apart from Mr. Crocker's personal
quaUttcations for the position to which he
aspires we who are engaged in the build
h)S industry are peculiarly interested in
Ms candidacy. Those of us who have ob
â¢enred the signs of the times cannot but
nave reached the conclusion that hard
;irnes are coming and that during the
next two years there will be a lull in all
the industries affecting the building
trades. 'If. as we believe, the election of
rrocker will have a tendency to minimize
'.ocally the hardships begotten by the
contraction of the money market and by
the reaction that follows an era of in
flated prosperity, surely we should be the
last" to throw any impediments in the
way.

F. G. Wilson called the meeting to or

chairman. Among the other speakers
were Thomas Hlckey, "Billy" Hynes, W.

The Columbia Quartet, composed of.J.
H. Davies, Fred Grifflng, James E. Dona

proceedings with a number of fine vocal
selections.
"I believe in high wages and I believe
in hard work. And now I want to entreat
you all to look well into the characters
and purposes of all the different candi
dates before you cast your ballots and
pick out those who will give you a good,
clean government, which will be an honor
to the city and to the future generations
to follow." i
"This is a great city and it is going to
be. greater. I want to see improvements
en all sides and I want all good citizens
to come forward and eupport this ticket,
which if elected will see that the right
foundation is laid for tne stepping stone
to the greater San Francisco. The op
portunities for the beautifying of this city
are unlimited, and we must see that every
opportunity is utilized for the develop
ment of this beauty. We are progressing
fast. The eyes of the whole' country are
turned upon this city by the Golden Gate.
The country Is watching this election
with great interest.
"Let us show them that from now on
we are going to have a good, clean gov
ernment; let us show them that we have
no boss: let us show them that we have
men in office here who own themselves
and are not owned by others. Let us
show them that we have no Abe Ruef
in our party. And I want to cay right
here, and I want to say it emphatically,
that if you want a government to be run
by a class or run by any political boss,
then you don't want me.
"I want you all here, irrespective of
your political affiliations, to break away
from the bonds of party and vote for San
Francisco and the welfare of San Fran
cisco, and to do this you must cast your
ballot for the men whose names are on
the Democratic ticket, which ticket I
have the honor to head. I am simply tell
ing you the plain truth when I say that I
am here in this fight for the good of this
city and its future welfare, and not for
any personal aggrandizement. I wonder
what Abraham Lincoln would say If he
were alive to-day and knew that in some
of these campaign meetings of our-op
ponents beer had been freely passed
among the auditors. I wonder what Lin
coln would say if he knew that the civil
service questions had been sold prior to
the examinations.
"I, want to see more playgrounds . for
our children. I want to see fine school
houses. I want to see the money spent
to the very best advantage. This city
in a few years hence will have a popu
lation of 1.000,000 people. I want to in
dorse my friend, W. W. Sanderson, for
he is an honest man and well qualified
to fill the position to which he has re
ceived the nomination.
"I want to brand the. statement of Van
Duser that I received a portion of that
$25,000 the city appropriated to fight the
case in the question of the Spring Valley
Water Works as an absolute falsehood.
I suppose I sha*ll be compelled to let the
jackass bray.
Franklin K. Lane addressed a great
crowd of voters of the Forty-thinlikAs
sembly District at the Alhambra Theater
last night. In the audience were many
representative people of the community
and men of affairs, who took a keen inter
est in the proceedings.
He opened up his remarks by saying: "I
know what is uppermost in your minds,
and th'at is the question. 'Who will win?'
It is not F. K. Lane who you want to
have win this election; it is the policy of
the true standard Democratic party that
you want to have win. The Chronicle has
recently been attacking me in regard to
my decisions in certain cases. I want to
say right here that none of us are infal
lible, but I do say if at any time I have
erred in Judgment I have always done
what I thought was right, and that is
the principle I have always worked on,
and If I am elected Mayor of >his great
municipality that is the principle I shall
maintain from start to .finish.

tingle question that I have passed on.

XANEÂ»S CAMPAIGN.
"Let us look back, late though it be.
Let us think of what the Union Labor
party was, not of what the Union Labor
party is. Two years ago the unions were
emerging from great struggles, from stu
pendous difficulties. A party was formed
âa party based on principles that ema
nate from a lofty patriotism. What has
become of this party? What relation does
It bear to union labor? A party that
sprang from lofty Ideals, from pure pur
poses and from a faith in human nature,
has become the catspaw of Ruef and
Schmitz and has been made the entering
wedge of one of the greatest systems of
municipal evils that ever disgraced a re
spectable city. Let us draw the curtain on
this pitiful sight, let us take courage and
fight for the cause of union labor by de
feating Schmitz and by relegating the un
speakable Ruef to the obscurity from
which he should never have emerged."
that the formation of the Labor party
would best subserve the Interests of or
ganized labor. If the party had been able
to carry out the promises which heralded
its birth the organization of a Henry J.
Crocker Workingmen's League would
have been unnecessary. But, as was pre
dicted at the time, the Union Labor party
was destined to become the victim of in
triguing, unscrupulous and unpatriotic
political manipulators. *â¢
â¢ Fred â¢ Eggers spoke in his own behalf.
He reiterated that he was ; a union man
and stood for unionism in; the .strictest
sense of the word. Mr. Eggers modestly
dwelt on "what he had done for this city

When Judge Bahrs had concluded his
scorching criticism of the Incumbent the
voters cheered lustily for him. He was
compelled to leave the hall and attend
another meeting, and as he moved down
the stairs the cheers of the Ocean View
residents rang in his ears.,
William E. Lutz, candidate for Public
Administrator, was introduced to the
gathering and made a hit. He talked
plainly, to the assembled voters. He as
sured the citizens that he was no come
dian.and could not entertain them with a
laughing song or tell them funny stories.
He was simply a veteran of the Civil War
who had lived among the people of this
city for a score of years and during that
time had always lived an upright life. He
said 'he was a candidate for. Public " Ad
ministrator and If he was elected. the of
fice would be conducted in a businesslike
and honorable manner.
LTJTZ DOES NOT SING.
Judge George H. Bahrs made another
of his characteristic speeches in support
cf his candidacy as Assessor of this city
and county. The Judge his recovered the
use of his voice again and 1b again deliv
ering vigorous speeches against his opjx>
nent. He does not mince words and up
to date has torn a few more pages out of
the record pf Dr.. Washington Dodge.
Within the past five days the "George H.
Volunteers," which was inaugu
rated with ten members, has grown to a
membership of 12,000 and will undoubtedly
reach "a membership of 23,000 before elec^
tlon day. These members have- signed a
roll to use all honorable methods and
means to secure the electloh of'the Judge.
In his speech, to the voters of Ocean View
last night. Judge Bahrs said:
"There never was a time in the history
of the Republican party, so .far as mu
nicipal politics are concerned, where the
prospects for the party's success were as
propitious as they are now. Wherever you
go the Indications point in the same di
rection. We have many attended meet
ings throughout the city, every one > of
which was: crowded to the doors and In
which the: enthusiasm was unmeasured
and the public- seemed to be waiting but
for an . opportunity to give, final expres
sion to it. . The history of the Republican
party! of- the United States Is- the history
<* the ..United States. The inspiration and
the mainspring of that success is to be
found in the slogan 'Protection to*Ameri
can labor and American Industries.'
"In this municipal campaign we , can
have the slogan of protectionâ protection
to the taxpayer. The protection of which
I speak will be wielded In the greatest
measure .by*. the man who occupies the
Mayor!s chair. The Mayor's office is, in
deed, a complicated piece of machinery,
which .may be best represented to the
mind by' the mechanism of the wheel. The
Mayor represents the hub and the various
municipal -officers the spikes. There may
be a weak spoke here and there and- yet
the substantial strength of the wheel be
not Impalred;;but let the hub be insecure,
of weak material, and the wheel is unseri
viceable. So it is with the office of Mayer.
If the right man is -chosen the municipal
wheel will be serviceable; if he is not, it
will be useless. Surveying the whole po
litical field, it appears to me that there is
no man who is better qualified to occupy
the part of the hub of this wheel than the
Hon. Henry J. Crocker. (Applause.)
"Now a few words for myself. I was
nominated at a time when the sentiment
was universal throughout the city that'
my opponent was practically invincible. I
was not discouraged or disheartened by
any such remark, because I was satisfied
that that rumor was being industriously
circulated by no one other than Dr.
Washington Dodge and cohorts. I felt
that with the nomination of the Republi
can party went the pledge of the party to
support the nominee. The Democratic
standard bearer in his opening speech ad
mitted that the Republican party, was
numerically the strongest in this city and
county of San Francisco. If this be .true
and there is any merit in the pledge of the
party then in God's name how can the
Republican ticket be defeated? (Ap
plause).
"Aside from his claim of invincibility
he has placed himself upon the pedestal
and thrown about himself a mantle ap
parently of immaculate purity. Let us
tear out a page or . two of his political
record and see If he, is Justly entitled to
assume that virtuous position. Dr. Dodge
was himself one of those who evolved
that provision of the charter which, pro
vided that the Assessor should be paid
$4000 a year in full compensation for all
his services. This provision of the charter
was ingrafted therein for the purpose of
substituting the conditions which were in
vogue in the consolidation act, namely,
which gave the Assessor $8000 a year sal
ary besides 15 per cent of the poll tax
collections, amounting to $16,000 a year.
Being elected upon a platform pledging
him to support that new charter, he was
certainly the last person any honorable
man would find an opponent of the char
ter. But the very first thing he did on
getting into office was to appropriate to
himself the sum of $16,000 per year, which
in the aggregate of his term would have
amounted to $64,000, and he would have
appropriated this entire amount to him
self had not the Supreme Court of Call
fornia said to him, 'Dr. Dodge, that
money does not belong to you; it belongs
to the city and county and you must dis
gorge it.'
"I might cite other indications of his
violation of the charter, but this will suf
fice, for a man who will commit such a
violation of his pledge Is fully competent
and capable of violating many others.
"Dr. Washington Dodge has sent thou
sands of circulars to the taxpayers of this
city, informing them that he had reduced
their taxes and demanding of them the
return favor of their vote. If he Justly
reduced the taxation, he did the taxpay
ers no favor. If he did not, he granted
them a favor at the expense of the other
taxpayers, and thereby he has forfeited
the favorable consideration of the voters."
(Great applause and ,. cheers for Judge
Bahrs.)
BAHRS SUBB OF SUCCESS.
Robert A. Vance, candidate for Super
visor, Bald he had the Interests of the city
at heart and wanted to see It progress.
He. hoped ..he might be elected, that he
might do his share in making the city one
of the finest in the Union.
Sweeney, his colleague on the ticket, and
Percy V. Long, nominee for City Attor
ney, who are confined to their homes and
are unable to make a vigorous campaign
In their own behalf. The Judge also told
about his past record and appealed to the
voters to support him If they thought he
merited It. He also asked that they sup
port the entire ticket.
Republicans Will
Stand by the
Ticket.

CITY OF PARIS DRY GOODS COMPANY,
Geary and Stockton Streets, Union Square.Mrs. Hudson's WilL
OAKLAND, Oct. 24.â An Inquest held on
the remains of Daniel Rogers, 103 years old,
who sustained fatal injuries from being
knocked down at Third and Townacnd
streets In San Francisco, was held this
evening and resulted In the bringing In of
a divided verdict. Eight out of a Jury of
nine decided that Rogers had died of
pneumonia, while the - ninth man stated
that he believed that the man had died
from the effects of the Injuries sustained
through the negligence of the Southern
Pacific Company. Rogers had only ar
rived here recently from Watsonville on
a visit to his daughter.
Coroner's Jury Disagrees.
"Well," said the Judge, "the only thing
will be for me to get another license to
morrow."
"Maesa," said Sam, "did yo* pay any
t'iner fur dem license?"
"Yes, Sam; a dollar and seventy-five
cents."
"Will another license cos' anyt'lng?"
"Yes, Sam; a dollar and seventy-five
cents more." replied the Judge.
After scratching his woolly pate for a
few minutes, Sam replied:
"Well, massa, I done axed Kyarllne an*
she sed "Yase," but fo" de Lawd dere ain't
no dollar an' seventy-five cents difference
In dem two nlggars, so I'll Jus' take Lu
cindy." â Lippincott's. , ;
"Yes, Sam, you old fool. Tou didn't tell
me whom you want to marry, but I re
membered how you're always hanging
around courting Lucinda and got the li
cense in her name."
"Lawd. massa!" exclaimed Sam, " 'taint
Lucindy, it's Kyarllne. Â¦What's I gwlne
tcr do, massa?"
Oen morning, as Judge C of N County,
Va., was starting for the town, he was
approached by one of his negroes, who
with more or less confusion asked:
"Massa, when yo' goes to the co'thouse
will yo' git me a license? I'se gwlne to
be mar'ed." â¢ ,";
"Married, are you. Earn? All right,"
called the Judge as he hastily drove off.
Arrived at the courthouse, he spent a
very busy day, and it was. not until he
was preparing to leave that he remem
bered Sam's license and realized that he
had not been told the name of the bride
elect.
. "The old idiot, he never told me whom
he wants to marry, but. of course, it's Lu
clnda; he's always making eyes at her."
So saving he returned to the courthouse
and had the license made out In the names
of Sam and Luclnda. Sam was the first
to greet him upon his return with the in
quiry:
"Git my license, maasa?"
The License Won.
It* la a curious thing, and one that re
mains a standing puzzle even to those
connected with the business all their
lives, that tightrope, trapeze and other
daring performers who chiefly work in
the open air at galas and so on are far
more liable to "stage fright," If it may
be so .called, than are their fellows who
only show their prowess under a roof.
Another fact equally well known la that
once a woman performer has heard the
ringing shouts of an applauding public,
once she has learned some dangerous
feat, she 'will run risks and quite fearless
ly perform tricks that no male in the
same line would ever dream of. The wo
man athlete has not to be urged on; she
has to be restrained, more often than not
It may be said at once that few among
the Dubllc know how near death such
people occasionally are. /
As illustrating both the facts stated
above, the. writer can never forget seeing
a woman tightrope walker whose rope
had been left too slack. She was per
forming at a great height, and when she
got to a certain distance along, the rope
the latter sagged so that she could neither
advance nor retire. The public knew
nothing of the danger until the manager
In an agpny - tried , to get two . Immense
ladders, tied together, up to the rope. But
this arrangement fell short, and even if
it had - not i done bo no one " would have
dared to rest it against the swaying rope.
At last the ladders were held bodily up
right by strong men till the topmost rung
just touched the rope; then . a gallant
young fellow, a sailor, went up, while the
ladder swayed about as though In a
breeze. He snatched â¢; the woman' on the
rope and held her, just as she fainted and
dropped the balancing pole.â Tit-Bits.

"If the two proceedings for warrants
for removal," said Judge Holt, "resulted
In an order for removal, it is obvious
that such orders could not be complied
with at the same time. My conclusion
Is that the arrest on the second warrant
will be vacated."
NEW YORK. Oct. 24.â Two decisions in
the case of George W. Beavers, the In
dicted postal official, were handed down
to-day by Judge Holt. In one, the appli
cation of Beavers to have United States
District Attorney Youngs of Brooklyn
and Miss Amy Wren, his stenographer,
punished for disobeying a subpena of
Commissioner Hitchcock, 13 denied.
The application for a writ of habeas
corpus and certlorarl asked In behalf of
Beavers in the second charge against him
based on the Washington Indictment Is
granted, and the arrest is vacated. The
Judge holds 'that a second arrest made
on the Washington Indictment when
Beavers was already In court on the
Brooklyn. Indictment was illegal.
If this decision Is applicable to the other
three Washington indictments, it will re
sult in his arrest on all four indictments
returned against him J by the Federal
Grand Jury in Washington being vacated
pending the final decision by the Federal
Court of the New York District on the
proceedings In the pending indictment.
Beavers had been arrested in the New
York District on a bench warrant calling
for his removal to the Brooklyn District
to be tried on this indictment. He had
demanded examination here and had
given bail when he was again arrested
on a warrant calling for his removal to
Washington for trial on the first Wash-
Ingtoivindlctment. At first he demanded
examination and gave bail, but later his
surety surrendered him, and his attor
neys swore out a habeas corpus on the
ground that his simultaneous removal to
Brooklyn and Washington was impos
sible.

: It has been said of the American navy
! that the officers are more exacting In the
I observance of etiquette and the proper
I courtesies than those of other navies, and
I that the minute distinctions of punctill
! ousness are more marked among the of
| fleers of the navy than among the officers
I of the army. However true this may be,
! it is not to be denied that officers of the
; military and naval services are apt to be
' more scrupulous and exacting In etiquette
I than are civilians, and there have been
I some humorous incidents related of this
i practice of naval officers.
It would seem, perhaps, that the smaller
! the vessel of the navy of half a century
; ago the more emphatic or more exacting
' were the officers in command In what
I they considered was due to their rank
i and* station. An incident of this character,
related by one of the older officers a
couple of evenings ago "at the club,"
was that during the Mexican War the
i fleet In front of Vera Cruz was Joined by
1 several gunboats of the most diminutive
I typeâ Improved affairs.
An officer of one of tbe larger vessels
j had occasion to visit one of the little fel
lows in his official capacity, and. ranging ;
: up alongside in his barge (which, by the
1 way, was nearly as large as the vessel he ;
was officially visiting), he stepped over j
the port quarter, when the lieutenant in â¢
command, in a tone of offended dignity,
Informed the visitor, who was his su
perior by two grades, that his vessel had !
a gangway on the starboard side, and <
that it was not only proper, but that the j
navy regulations prescribed, that officers ;
of and above a certain rank should board
by that gangway.
The young officer added that, while his
vessel might not be much bigger than the I
visitor's barge, so long as it was In com- j
mission and he was in command he did ;
not propose to have any of the usual j
rules of etiquette disregarded. The vis
itor fully comprehended the intent of the !
rebuke, and he at once returned' to his J
barge and went around to the starboard I
gangway and Â¦was received by " the !
"piping" of the boatswain's mate.
It happened that this same lieutenant
was subsequently rebuked by hia own j
Fon, soon after the latter received his
first commission. The son was on duty*
at the New York navy yard, and the .
father was in command of a vessel Jhat !
had just been put into commission, "and j
he was anxious to get his provisions and !
stores on board that he might get away
on his cruise. Going through the navy
yard to call on the commandant of the
station, the captain saw his son in uni
form walking toward his headquarters in
the storehouse, and he shouted "Henry!"
two or three times, without getting any
response. Finally the son turned about
and said in a dignified tone: "Are you <
aduressing me, sir?" j
"Yes," replied the father; "I sent in a;
requisition for my stores, and I wish' you 1
wou"fd hurry it through, bo that I can j
have the things delivered as promptly as j
possible, for I am anxious to get to sea."
"Very well," replied the young officer,
"I will look into the matter; but please
bear in mind that when I am on duty I
am to be addressed as mister or by my
military title; when I am at home or at!
pome unofficial affair I am Henry or any
thing you please." /
That the father recognized the propriety
of the rebuke by his son was shown by'
his often telling the story afterward at]
his own expense. "Henry or anything
you please" is still alive, and is
yet in the navy.â New York Tribune. j

While a section of tbe Federal statutes
provides that officers of national banks
shall brand counterfeits as "counterfeit"
or "worthless." it has been found that
the national banks in some Instances Ig
nore this provision, while State and pri
vate banking institutions habitually dis
regard It. The reason for this Is that a
bank which rigidly enforced the law us
ually found that the owner withdrew his
account and put It in some bank where
the officers were less particular in this
regard.â Express Gazette.
Chief Wllkie of the United States se
cret service has called on the officers of
the New York Clearing-house to assist
his men In the detection of circulating
counterfeit notes. The officers of tha:
association have been asked to require
all the banks Â©Derating under Its rules
to properly deface counterfeit money
whenever It Is presented. Chief Wilkla
finds that a great many banks refuse to
do this, for fear of offending patron*-.
and that as a result many a dangerous
counterfeit goes back Into circulation aft
er its spurious character has been pointed
out.
Chief Wilkle says that in tracing the
history of "counterfeit notes It has been
discovered that in many instances hold
ers of notes had submitted them to bank
officers for opinions as to their genuine
ness; that the bank officers had described
the notes as Counterfeit and then re
turned them to the holders without brand
ing them as "counterfeit" or "worthless."
Similarly counterfeit notes detected in
dally remittances were returned to de
positors unbranded. This practice not
only lengthened the life of the note in
circulation but was a direct incentive to
the holder to commit the crime of pass
ing a note when he knew it to be coun
terfeit. ; â¢-â¢: ;"

After passing another town of three or
four mud huts, says a writer in Harper's
Magazine, we enter the famous desert of
Islay. on which are what I consider the
ir.ost remarkable natural curiosities to be
BÂ«Â»Â«n on this globe, for we are now among
hundredsâ nay, thousandsâ of pure white
cand crescents, on a plateau of 4500 feet
above the level of the sea and fifty-four
miles from the coast, where all else Is of
r dark red or chocolate color. Whence
comes this sand and why always In a
crescent shape? Professor Bailey, whom
I afterward met at Arequipa. in charge of
the Harvard University observatory, told
me that pcicntific men do not agree as
lo the reason why the sand always forms
the eame crescent shape, although it is
generally believed that the whirling eddies
hereabouts are responsible; some, how
ever, argue that such is not the case,
elr.ee each one of these crescents has an
opening toward the northeast. At any
rate, the Inner circle Is an almost per
pendicular wall of the finest pure white
rand, and from the upper edges the cres
cent slopes gradually away on the out-
Bide. Ttiey average twenty feet In height,
the inner circle having a diameter of some
fifty feet, although I 'have seen one at
least a mile and a half in diameter, which
was. however, not much higher than the
average. These crescents move. It Is es
timated, at the rate of three Inches every
twenty-four hours; and when, on the
eiow Journey, one- comes near the rail
road. It becomes necessary to shovel the
eand across tbe tracks, after which It
travels on, forming new crescents or
mingling with some of the others.âBalti

The Wonderful "Whizzers."
*1 AVE you ever seen the new "whizzers" and felt the almost mad-
L-J deriing thrill of seeing them go flying by like meteors? The
J[ I sensation is strange beyond description, as strange as the new
w/ "whizzers" themselves, which are monsters of the most freakish
sort â monsters the like of which never were seen before. And how thev
sing as they gol And with what terrific speed they cleave the air! Just
think of annihilating distance at the rate of less than a mile a minute!
That is how the "whizzers" go. Long, lean and low like a gray wolf
some of them are. while others speed on their way like gh9Stly wraiths â
but with such catapult swiftness that the senses are first bewildered and
then intoxkated. It is a sensation that nobody ever escapes. If you do
you will be as superhuman as the new "whizzers" themselves.
Of course you haven't felt the thrill yet, for the new "whizzers" have
not yet reached San Francisco. But they are coming â coming fast now
â and next week the town will be full of them. And if vou don't know
what a "whizzer" is like it is a foregone conclusion that you will buy the
next Sunday Call, which will print two full pages telling you all about
themâ where they come from, why they are here and where the> are
going and. best of all, what keeps them always in such a tremendous
hurry/and why they sing so as they go. Indeed the new "whizzers"
will simply fascinate you.
Almost as remarkable as the "whizzers" is the new artillery drill now
performed by Uncle Sam's boys in blue stationed in the West. Just
think of seeing a batterv of light artillery go clattering and bumping
over the ruts of a stubble field and after careening madly around a shock
of new-mown hay come into action, shoot holes into a dense fog and
knock into smithereens the kneeling figure of a man four miles away,
which they could not see by a good two miles. And yet it is not so much
what they do as the way thev accomplish such remarkable shots that
makes the new field, drill truly wonderful. Just see the pictures in the
next Sunday Call. <
And still there is more to interest you. For instance, there is the
third installment oT the "Golden Fetich," which tells you more of the
Africa of to-day than has been revealed by any explorer since the great
Stanley gave his discoveries to the world. Then there is "The Cough in
â¢Lower Seven," by Frank H. Spearman, which is as fascinatingly myste-
rious as tl^ title itself, and â but of course you know what excellent
railroad stories Spearman writes. Then fhere are the "Me-ows of a
Kitty," clever, witty, charming little bits that you will quote to all vour
friendsâ and your lover. And the "Drawing-room Gowns for Winter";
and the beautiful "Child Model." (This is a full-page picture that will
make the same strange appeal to you that it does to everyone else who
has seen it.)
But â and here is genuine news for youâ do you know about the big
golden jubilee of the. Catholic Church that will be.celebrated in this
city next Sunday. It will be one of' the most notable events in all the
history of the church. in this State. This article has been written
specially and exclusively for the Sunday Call.CAMBRIDGE. Oct. 24.â Harvard had no

BRIGHTON BEACH, ft. T.. Oct. 24.â
Notwithstanding the discomforts attend
ing outdoor eport to-day, there was an
excellent attendance at Brighton Beach,
where the autumnal season of racing
twelve days In duration, was brought to
a close. The card Included the colt divis
ion of the Produce stake and a handicap
at a mile and a Quarter.
The latter contest was of the most
thrilling description, three racf rs finishing
so close together that, while many
thought that they could name the wln
n<r, none was certain until the official
verdict web rendered. This was that Wil
liam Astor Chandler's SaJva.tella had won.
She was on the outside, or nearest to the
public. A majority of the onlookers were
of the opinion that Eugenia Burch had
won. She was in the center. From the
clubhouse it seemed as if Hurstbourne
had won. He was next the rail. The
Judges declared that it. was by far the
closest finish of the meeting between
thr^e horses. Summary:

THE SUMMARIES.
LOS AXGKLES. Oct. 24.â Weather fine
track fast. Summary:
On top of this came another single-horse
race. Seven faced the rubber In a seven
furlong jaunt, and Sherry, a 4 to 1 chance,
ridden by Waterbury, wa's not headed
from the first Jump. Limber Jim, the 3 to
4 favorite, piloted by Ikey Fullett, lost the
place to Adrea, a 30 to 1 outsider.
Although Meteora finished on three legs
he was good enough to capture the third
purse. The distance was five furlongs,
and Frawley, who had the leg, got his
away first to a ragged start. Phyz, the
favorite, under Henderson's indifferent
handling fought it out for the place with
Adnor a couple of lengths behind Meteora
at the end. Roltalre was left again.
El Plloto had the honor of being In
stalled favorite, and once more the brown
gelding met with defeat. "With Frawley
In the saddle, as usual, he closed a 3 to 4
favorite for the fourth number and fin
ished second to Myrtle H. On the stretch
turn Krawley lost an acre of ground,
while See, astride Myrtle H, hugged the
rail. The latter mare was heavily backed,
and In a driving finish received the ver
dict by a head. Sir Christopher ran a
poor third.
Powell followed up his victory on Solon
by landing the concluding mile selling run
with George Dewey. Billy Moore cut out
thepace, but faltered noticeably the last
sixteenth, succumbing by nearly a length
finally. Chandler, rider of the last-named
horse, was fined $25 by the Judges for
Jostling the winner. Searcher, which
opened favorite, would prove more ser
viceable in the express wagon business.
It is reported on good authority to-night
that John F. Morse, presiding judge at
"Washington Park, Chicago, will act In
that capacity when Ascot Park opens on
December 24. F. E. MULHOLLAN'D.
Blue Miracle, a 3 to 2 favorite, with big
Bill Knapp on his back, made a cathop of
the introductory sprint. Behind him
tracked a dilapidated cluster of cheap
ones, and the first chance was with
Knapp taking him up. Achilles, piloted
by Lee. beat the late Mr. Frawley, astride
Tamm.
Strictly speaking three favorites got
home first. The. feature event of the day
wan the Mott handicap, decided over one
mile and a sixteenth, with a field of five
starting. Solon, carrying top weight, 116
pounds, had first call in the betting, and
under Powell's clever horsemanship led
M. P. Tarpey out half a length In 1:47.
Bragg made all the running, but after be
ing bumped In the stretch was willing to
give It up. M. F. Tarpey, which had but
96 pounds to negotiate, appears .to have
suffered a return of his best form. Dr.
Sharp, the 90-pounder, with a better start
would have been a contender. Grail could
not untrack herself.
LOS ANGELE8, Oct. 24.â There was an
other large crowd at Agricultural Park
this afternoon, and the syndlcators were
kept busier than the peanut merchant at
a Harbor View Sunday picnic Neither
the choke nor strangle hold was barred,

The firat round, of the Henry H. Lynch
cup stake for greyhounds was run yester
day afternoon at Ingleside Coursing Park.
There were a number of upsets In the
betting. In one trial thÂ© showing made
by one of the hounds was so unsatisfac
tory that Judge Tierney declared all' bets
off, "for which action he was applauded
by the spectators. This was the course
between October Lad and McHenry. The
former was the offender, and his poor
showing will probably result in an in
vestigation by the stewards as ' to the
cause. . r ., ...
The. dogs which are thought to have a
chance for a share of the big money this
afternoon are Queen's Motto, Homer Boy,
Our Motto, J. E. H. and Little Plunger.
The trials were of a more even charac

ing their -way to the escapes, and not
taking -the dogs all over the field. Few

CHICAGO. Oct. -24.â Colonial Girl,
backed from. 6, to ldown to ,4 to 1,. won
the Fort Dearborn handicap at Worth to
day. It was the most sensational race
run at the local- tracks this year, as five
of 'the nine were compactly bunched at
the wire, probably not more than two
lengths separating them all. . Â¦
There was a long delay at the post and,
when finally sent away, the field was
strung out. with Toah a length in front.
At the turn Haviland took command and
he held the lead to the far turn, closely
attended by Toah and Sidney C. Love.
Jockey Gray in the meantime had Wlt
full pocketed, while Colonial Girl had
clear sailing. Turning into the stretch
Colonial Girl passed Toah. leading him a
neck. The two raced together, with Sid

The track was fast, the weather clear

MEMPHIS, iTenn.,' Oct 24.â Lou Dillon,
the peerless trotter owned by C.K.' G.
Billingg;of Chicago and driven by" Mil
lard Sanders/proved her right to the
proud title of queen of the turf this after
noon by trotting a mile under ' adverse
conditions .In the remarkable tlme : of
1:58%. The daughter of, Sidney Dillon was
paced by a runner driven by Scott Mc-
Coy and another runner followed closely
to urte- the. mare to a supreme effort.
The track of the Memphis Driving Club
never, showed to better advantage.
Sprinklers were employed throughout the
day putting on finishing touches and
when the time: for Lou Dillon's -trial ar
rived the course waq perfect. -A. strornj
wind from the. north swept down the long
back stretch, however, and Judge Newton
announced to - the : spectators * that too
much should not be expected of the game
little trotter.
Lou Dillon appeared on the track v at
5:10 p. m. and after a preliminary spin
Sanders announced he was ready for the
start. The two. runners were aligned in
position and It was noticed that a strip
of board about one yard wide was fas
tened to the pacemaker' 3 sulky directly
under the seat. This, it was announced,
was used to keep the dust out of the
mare's face. â¢ â¢ * .
OFT AT FIBST ATTEMPT.
At the first start Sanders nodded for
the word and the flag dropped. After go-
Ing an eighth of a mile Sanders yelled to
McCoy to drive faster, nnd it looked as
if the mare would catch the runner. Mak
ing the first turn the remarkable work
of Lou Dillon could be better seen by tho
thousands present and like a piece of
perfect machinery she reached the quarter,
pole in :30. The turn for the back stretch
was now reached, and many expected to
see the champion falter because of the
wind. To the surprise of every one Lou
Dillon seemed to travel faster and when
the half-mile was reached the timer's
slate clicked out :59V6- A great cheer arose
and many horsemen predicted that a new
record was making. On the far turn Mc-
Coy was forced to whip the runner to
keep clear of. the trotting marvel which
was pressing him closely. The three
quarters pole was passed in 1:28V4 and the
mare had turned for home.
The wind was an advantage now rather
than a detriment and with a superb burst
of speed Lou Dillon, urged on by tho
shouts of the drivers of the : runners,
dashed under the wire In 1:58^.
When the time was flashed to the spec
tators hats were thrown Into the air and
cheer followed cheer. Sanders was liter
ally lifted from his sulky by an admiring
throng, while Mr. 1 Billings was showered
with congratulations. : It was a noticeable
fact that watches of the three official
timers agreed to the fraction, and many
horsemen standing in the Infield caught
the time as officially announced to a
fraction. The timers j were. Budd Doble,
Fred Hartwell of Chicago and John Dick
erson of New-York. .: - â.,â.-, x . ,

DRIVER SANDERS' PREDICTION.
"I am not a bit surprised at the result
of Lou Dillon's effort. 1 expected to
break the .world's record despite the ad
verse conditions. I desire to say that it
Is my candid opinion that Lou Dillon can
trot as fast as any horse in the world
can pace, and next year I will demon
strate this statement. With perfect con
ditions to-day I would be afraid to say
how fast the mare would have trotted
the mile."
Two other world's. records were broken
this afternoon. Dariel, a bay mare by
Alexander, driven by McDonald, paced a
mile in 2:00^4. The former pacing record
for a mare was held by Fanny Dlllard,
2:03%. ..â¢Â¦Â¦'...

Special Dispatch* to The Call,
NEW YORK. Oct. 24.â President Thom
as Hi Williams of the New California
Jockey Club of San Francisco has com
pleted his labors in New York and began
his journey to San Francisco Thursday.
He will spend three days in Chicago to
complete some details of his mission to
induce Eastern horsemen and those from
the Middle West to attend the winter
racing season and then head" for his home
city, where he Bays all is in readiness for
what promises to be. the most, successful
racing season ever -seen in California.
Never before has there been a. better
outlook so far as the horses about New
York proper is concerned, and while never
before have there been four tracks bid
ding for patronage it is assured that the
coast will secure the "class" of-the horses
in training. Many owners who have an^
nounced their intention of racing, at Los
Angeles will do so largely as an expert'
ment, with San Francisco In view should
the new association fail to live up to any
of its many promises.
President Williams would make no pub
lic declaration of the attitude he intends
taking toward the Los Angeles track, .al
though he has never been worried over
the rival in the Far West. It is thought
he will throw no obstacles in the way of
the new association so long as its man
agers are content to conduct a thoroughly
reputable meeting, although it will be
asked that the rulings of the San Fran
cisco tracks be respected In the manage
ment of the new meeting.
RACE PROMOTER ACTIVE.
With Sheridan Clark doing the advance
work for the meeting of the Crescent City
Jockey Club at New Orleans, Tom Wil
liams exploiting San Francisco with the
able help of "Jake" Holtman, J.' W.
Brooks, Ed Cole and other lieutenants
holding forth on the many advantages of
racing at Los Angeles and some misison
ary work done on behalf, of the proposed
meeting at Hot Springs, the horsemen
have never had such a variety offered for
the winter months. Horsemen thus far
have been loth to take the Hot Springs
meeting seriously. This condition of af
fairs practically put that track out of the
running so far as securing promises from
horsemen was concerned and It has been
a pretty contest between New Orleans,
San Francisco and Los Angeles for the
patronage. San Francisco has more than
held her own in this contest and when
the season opens next month it will be
with all the old stables and with a goodly
percentage of new ones, who have long
looked forward to a season at the coast.
One plan that will be put into opera
tion as a. saving of the expense of the
long trip across the continent is for a
single trainer to gather a string of con
siderable dimensions and formidable class
from several racing establishments. He
will be a public trainer and the composite
String will .be composed of high-class
horses that will perform In many of the
stakes. â¢ No 1 horses-wtJr' be-taken except
for an active racing campaign. The
trainer has not yet been named for this
duty, but It is assured that every care
will be taken in his selection, and; that
he will have, the Fervices of one or two
of the bÂ»?st jockeys now riding in the
East. ,
IIACKEY DWYEE TO START.
Sandy McNaughton. who ! brought
Jockey Connell from San Francisco oarly
this season, will return to the coast with
a good string, to which he has added
while in New York. One of the best of.
the lot and a horse which should give a'
good account of himself during the long
season is the three-year-old Mackey
Dwyer. Thi3 colt was ' purchased from
Senator McCarren and is a good stake
winner. He has engagements in the San
Francisco stakes and is the best Mc-
Naughton will have in his care when he
leaves.
"Doc" Kyle has announced he will racf.
In San Francisco. One of the fastest of
his lot Is Ahumada, winner of the Carter
handicap and several other high-class
handicaps. T. H. Healey will spend the
winter in California, but is one of the
horsemen who will go to Los Angele3
should conditions be favorable. William
Oliver will be seen at San Francisco, al
though he will depend upon purchases in
the West for his winter racing string.
Morris Donovan, who has the handling
of the steeplechase stable of W. F. Mac-
Lean of Toronto, Canada, has announced
that he expects to have a small and select
lot of jnmperB on the coast during the
coming season, although as yet he has
not brought the stable together. He \i .11
handle horses cf different interests.
E. E. Smathers, the millionaire owner
of McChesney, the champion four-year
old of the year, is said to be particularly
favorable to the San Francisco meetings
and an effort may be made to send the
pon of MacDuff to the coast. In the event
that he should decide to race in the
Western city Sam Hildreth will be the
trainer chosen and his presence hinges
largely on the question as to whether or
not Hildreth would be welcome. In New
York Frank Taylor has been handling the
horses for Mr. Smathers, but it was onl>
because of Hildreth being in bad odor
with the New York Jockey Club. This
fact would have kept Smathers from rac
ing in the East at all had it not been
for his eagerness to meet HermJs and Wa
terboy. He met and decisively defeated
Hermis. while Waterboy has carefully
avoided a meeting. â¢
HEAVY, PXUNGERS COMING-.
Bookmakers will attend San Francisco
in the same number as former years and
there â¢will be a newcomer in the person
of Plunger John J. Ryan, he of ."get-rlch
quick" fame. Ryan will not operate un
der his own name in the San , Francisco
ring, but he will have a book and possi
bly two throughout the entire racing sea
son. In the i>ast month the operations of
Ryan on t the Eastern turf have been of
the most*glgantlc nature. He has been a
thorn in the. side of the Jockey Club,
whose great desire Is to call as little at
tention as possible to the betting end of
racing by reason of the existing j laws.
Some of the ethers who will have slates
in San Francisco are George Rose. Joe
Rose, William Jackman. J. H. Davis and
several members of the Metropolitan Turf
Association, the governing body of the
reputable bookmakers in the East.
Manager Brooks while in New York
has been using every endeavor to secure
the services ' of "Jake" Holtman ." and
"Dick" Dwyer to start at the Los An
geles'meeting, and this fact may result
in complete harmony in the racing situa
tion of the West. Both of these starters
are engaged to alternate at Oakland and
Ingleside. and.it is up.to President Wil
liams, whose permission is needed. â¢ Mr.
Williams has expressed a willingness to
share his officials should the Los Angeles
association "agree to conform with the
rules of the New California Jockey, Cldb,
the governing body of racing on the coast.
No answer has been Â¦ reported from Man
ager Brooks, but It Is thought. this con
dition will: be accepted and the starters
will b*Â» appointed. Â¦ . '..'.Â¦Â¦'Â¦''Â¦Â¦ '.-â¢'.

The victorious march of the Polytech

checked by the team from the Lick High
School yesterday morning, when the for
mer team went under by a score of 10 to

but the latter players were game and
fought every inch of the way.
â¢ The Lick eleven played the better foot
ball all along the line and profited by the
costly fumbles of their opponents. They
also bucked the line with a deal of force
and were effective on the defensive. The
Polytechnic players made several at
tempts at field goals and failed each time.
Yesterday's game evened up the three
high ' school elevens, . Lick, Polytechnic
and 'Lowell. ..."..-.
After the game the Polytechnic - giants
were remembered by the fair young ladies
of the school in the way of a quiet little

By far the best match was that between
Frank Mitchell and Sidney Salisbury.
Each won a set, the score being 6â3, 3â6.
Salisbury Is improving steadily and has
one of the fastest drives In the city. Ho
passed Mitchell repeatedly, but the latter
v.as stronger on overhead worfc.
Dr. Lovegrove, the most regular attend
ant on the club courts, showed how rap
idly he has been improving. He gave Gus
Lisser odds of "20" and played a tie with
him. The doctor's peculiar service was
hard for his younger opponent to handle.
Harry Halght and Herbert Long played
four fast sets. Halght won all four, but
the youngster crowded him and made him
play his best to do so.
A. W. Worthington maintained his win
ning streak by taking W. F. Bull into
camp. The winner has not lost a match
in several months and seldom loses a set.
In "doubles Worthington and Bull joined
forces and proved too strong for Dr. No
ble and R. B. Daggett, whom they beat in
straight sets. The matches played result
ed as follows:
A. \V; Worthington beat W. F. Bull,
6-4, 6-4; Herbert Long beat Melville Long,

The California Club tennis courts were
as well patronized yesterday as Is usual on
Saturday. In the afternoon it was a dif
ficult matter to get a court. The poorer
players had the courts to themselves, as
most of the cracks did not appear.
In the seventh inning, with two on the
sacks and as many gone; Sheehan hit one
to the third base line that looked like a
double; but, as luck willed It, the un
speakable Martinke grabbed the ball with
one mitt and made a play that was a
wonder. .
By winning yesterday's game the Sen
ators Jumped into second place, as San
Francisco was beaten at Portland. It
seems the native stickers will come home
In fifth place. They have not won a game
since they left here, and their chances
of one victory; in' the north are exceed
ingly slim. The score:

After the first period had 'passed, Peter
banished Cooney. Young McKay came to
the front and pitched good ball. Of
course, he could not . win the way the
team was playing ball behind him. but
he did the best he could. In addition to
twirling a steady game, he boosted the
leather over the right-field fence In the
last spasm f or* a home run. ;
Mike Fisher's latest, Killilea, went Into
the box for the first time, and he shone
brightly nearly all the time. The Crip
ples did not make a run off his delivery.
In the middle of the sixth inning he com
plained of a sore arm. There were a
couple of men on the sacks at the time,
and as soon as Phil Knell entered the
box the Cripples got to him for three
runs.
Peter trotted one Cooney out on the
slab to toss up a few, and It is to be
hoped that this gentleman will never try
to play ball again. He has had tries each
year, and he gets worse as age creeps
upon him. He began the game yesterday
by walking three men In the first inning.
Then he allowed a hit, and Martinke
aided ,the good work by committing three
errors' in that round; so, In all, Mike's
Senators started off with a lead of four
tallies. / Â¦ . Â¦

The performance at the Eighth-street
baseball lot yesterday afternoon was a
sad and distressing one. It would be. a
crime to call it a ball game. Such an ex
hibition would not be allowed in the corn
cob league. The young gentleman who
plays third for Oakland made only five
errors, and the rest of the team com
mitted six more, so the way thf y played
can be more easily imagined than de

Young Corbett, the boxer, has accepted

were signed by Hanlon and by Morris

Corbett. They call for a twenty-round
contest on Tuesday, December 29,- the

The home team had the best of It from
a scientific standpoint and the interfer
ence was splendid. The line players, how
ever, will appear to better advantage if
they learn to get low. The visitors show
ed best in bucking the line. Neither side
showed how well It could punt. Both
teams were slow In getting into form
when the ball had been declared down
The playing was clean throughout. No
one on either side was Injured, although

The result was a distinct disappointment
to Stanford. The opposing team was not
unusually strong and did not have the
ability to stop end runs. Stanford's right
was extremely weak and the Nevadans
made stupendous openings on that side
between center and guard, guard â¢ and
tackle and tackle and end.
The Nevadans kept pounding away at
the Cardinal .rlsht guard and right tackle,
making good gains three times out of
four. Stanford got the ball on downs on
her own thirty-yard line and after buck
leg the center for gains made two more
disastrous and inexcusable fumbles. It
was Nevada's ball on downs and a Stan
ford man got overanxious on th*e Inst
play, with the result that his team was
pushed back five yards nearer the danger
point. .
The visitors were on the right side of
Stanford's field, twenty yards from the
goal line. Friezell tried a place kick,
which almost won the game. The ball
went just under the cross bar and the
cardinal -got out of danger by making
a touch-back and kicking. The game end
ed with a struggle for the ball in the mid
dle of the field.
Stanford held for downs !n the center
of the field. Then" there were a couple
of rushes, followed by a twenty-yard" run
close around the enemy's left end by
Chalmers. The rooters with the cardinal
banners cheered lustily. The lads - from
across the border got together a few min
utes later and dropped the next fotir line
buckers on the same degree of latitude.
The Nevadans could not make the dis
tance on three downs and had to punt.
One of the Cardinals made a fair catch.
The next scene was a horrible fluke on
the. part of I. Steckle of Nevada in at
tempting to catch the ball. The whistle
sounded at the end of the first half with
the ball In Stanford's hands on their op
ponents' thirty-five yard line.
Coach Lanagran gave his pupils a grill-
Ing in the intermission and started the
last half with three new men in the game.
Nevada kicked over the line. Stanford re
turned the compliment from the twenty
five yard spot and Friezell caught the
ball and ran fifteen yards. The Cardinal
held for three downs and blocked a kick.
Stanford was soon penalized for an off
side play. I. Steckle of Nevada carried
the pigskin around the enemy's right end
for a fifteen-yard gain, but his team was
held for two more downs in the same
place In attempting to find a hole in the
left of Stanford's line. Sprott of Stanford
made a splendid break through the line
and blocked a place kick. When the
eighty-eight limbs were untangled the
children of the desert had the ball. ,
Stanicrrt kicked to the goal line on w:e
â¢tart and a Nevada man carried the ball
to the twenty-yard line. The Cardinal
secured tne ball on downs after their op
ponents had made some slight gaalns. A
few line plunges and an end run netted
about ten yards and Nevada rallied.
Stanford tried â¢ a . fake . kick and lost ten
yards and the ball.
The Nevadans found some weak spots
on the right of thejine and Friezell and
Steckle did some good bucking and hur
dling.

Ever since the tournament started it
has been considered almost a certainty
that McNaught and McLaren would meet
in the finals. Even when Gray defeated
Craig, a crack bowler, by the one-sided
score of 21 to 3, the wise ones still picked
McNaught to win. Cook's chances
against McLaren were considered even
poorer than these of Gray against Mc-
Naught. The two losers were undoubted
ly off in their play, as Gray and Cook,
no matter how well they bowled, could
not beat such experts so easily.
As was expected, J. C. Moffat beat J.
M. Earsman rather The score
was 21 to 11. Only one other match re
mains to be played in this round, that
between Joseph Gray and J. McLa'chlan.

The fourth round of the Scottish bowl
ing tournament at Golden Gate Park was

prises of the season in bowling circles.

Naught rather easily, the score being 21

more point against Wallace A. Cook. The
score was 21 to 13.

the Berkeley campus. It was the
weight that told ag-ainst tne Inoians, for
there wÂ«rÂ« only two men emenjr them,
Schlldt ar.d Saur.dcrs. who could measure
up with such men as Overall. Stow,
Stroud. Heitmuller and Howard. The
rest of them ranged from 110 to 153 pounds !
!n weight and so handicapped that they '
rou!d not hold their heads up under the j
fierce charges of the enemy. Only once)
did the Indians gain their five yards on '
downs ar.a that was more the fault of |
California than theirs. The only thing !
that caved them from a worse beating !
was their quickness, which had been |
brought up to express speed by Schlldt. j
their coach, who played at one lime with
the Carlisle Indian eleven. The score at
thÂ© end was O to 0.
Stow kicked off. Chemawa caught and '
kicked it back. Geary ran it in ten yards I
Mini ran twenty yards. Whipple fumbled

Three more. Howard one yard* Forse two

That waiÂ» the way the game went all
the way through. California was not
held on downs more than once or twice.
The disaster would have been greater but
for California's frequent fumbles and
losses on account of offside play. - The
p<ore st the end of the first half stood
t3 to 0, the scarring being helped along
!>y Captain Overall's field goal from the
twenty-five-yard line Just before the
whistle sounded time.
In the second half the California eleven
was almort entirely substituted by other
players and the score did not run up so
iron. The timekeeper announced
the end of the second half before either
side had put the pigskin on the green
sward beyond the enemy's goal line.
Friezell, on* of the halfbacks from the
sagebrush State, sent the hearts of the
Stanford rooters into their mouths by
nearly kicking a field g>al Just before the
close pÂ£ Hit last half. That wa.i the on!y
time when there seemed any. lmmeJiat-:*

It is well known now that nearly every drug contains from one-half to nine-tenths alcohol, and the rest poison. I'm no advocate of the intemperate
use of alcohol, but if 'you have to take it, why can't you take it without the poison? It is proven that in thirty minutes after a drug is taken the physical vi-
tality is five per cent lower than before taking the drug â that is after the stimulation has passed off. %
Taking stimulants is like borrowing money for half an hour at five per cent interest â you borrow a dollar and pay back a dollar five in half an hour.
If that scheme kept up would break vour bank account it will just as surely break you down physically. Wouldn't it? :.Â»\:
Nature will stand a eood deal of punishment, but she will not stand it always. She gives you a strong body to start with, and demands an ac-
counting.
My method is to, help natureâ to add artificial vitality to that vou already have. Every one of us has a certain amount, according to our strength,
because vitality is strength. When vou lose some of this vitality vou are weakâ a weak man. My appliance pours a fresh supply into your body while vou
sleep. It generates electricity and pumps that into your nerves. Professor Loeb says that it is the basis of vitality, and my cures prove it.
Mr. EmileDore. Ivy, 'Modoc County, Cal., writes me: "I have had no indication of my old weakness since I have worn your Belt, and thÂ« rarlcocele Is
yielding nicely., 1 am well pleased." .;.'.;<
Now if you don't feel right I can cure you with my Electric Belt. If you are full of rheumatic pains I can knoclc them out I can pour oil into
your joints and limber them up. I have often said that pain and electricity can't live in the same house, and I prove it every day.
Mr. L. J. Barnett of Tillamook. Or., writes: "Tour treatment certainly does what no. other can. for it has cured me. I cannot praise tho Belt too highly,
and 'gladly recommend it in any case of vital weakness."
If it were not for the prejudice due to the great number of fakes in the land I would not be able to handle the business that would come to
me. The "Free Belt" fraud and the "Free Drug" scheme, which are not free at all, have made every one skeptical, but I know that I have a good
thing, and I'll hammer away until you know it.
One thing every man ought to know is this: Your body is a machine. It is run by the steam in vour blood and nerves* When you begin to
break down in any way you are out of steam. â¢ That's just what I want to eive you back.
Mr. A. Hubbs of Callstoga. Cal., says: "My rheumatism has entirely disappeared, my digestion is perfect, I have gained eight pounds In weight and all
the symptoms of weakness are gone, which is remarkable, considering my age." 'V
I have a cure in every town. Tell me where you live and I will give you the name of a man I've cured.
Tell me vour'trouble and I will tell you honestly whether I can cure you or not. If I can't cure vou I don't want your money. I have been in this
business 22 years, and I am the biggest man in it to-day by long odds, and I am growing yet, because I eive every man all he pays for. ?
Now, wouldn't you rather wear my life-ziving appliance while vou sleep every night, and feel its elowine warmth pouring into you. and feel your-
self takine on a new. lease of life with each application, than to cloe vour intestines up with a lot of nauseous drugs? Surely! Try me.
Mr. Abraham Spady of Alcatraz, Cal., writes: "I am cured of all my former ailments, and you have my heartfelt gratitude for what your treatment
has done for me."
If you will come and see me I'll explain it to you. If you can't call let me send you my book, full of the things a man finds inspiring to strength and
courage. Free if you send this ad.

Filipinos for San Diego Schools.
-SAN DIEGO. Oct. ti.â County Superin
tendent cf Schools Huph J. Baldwin has
received from Bernard Moses, head of the
department cf history in the University of
Calif orr.Ia. a letter asking him. to provide
ft>r tuition and care in the county schools
In this county of twelve or fifteen Fili

eigr.ISed his intention to do so. The pupils
will arrive in a few days.
The drafting season was arranged as
follows: From October 15 to November
15 for class A. from November 15 to De
cember 15 for class B. from December 15
to January 15 for class C. The drafting
season for the National and American
leagues runs from September 1 to October
Id, coming before any of the drafting sea
sons of any of the minor leagues
The National Association did not give
out anything in regard to the drafting
price of players from the clubs in Its Ju
risdiction to the National or American
leagues and the latter will undoubtedly
remain at the present figure. $750. The
drafting prices from each league in the
association, however, were fixed as fol
lows: From class B. $500; from class C
$300; from class D, $200.
A committee composed of President P.
T. Powers. M. H. Sexton and Secretary
Farrell was appointed to attend the
meeting of the national committee in
Cincinnati next Monday and take care of
the Interests of the association there,
the drafting price of players and other
matters pertaining to the National and
American leagues being left to the com
mittee. In regard to salary limits it waÂ«
decided that for class A this should be
placed at $2400. for class B at J1S00, c!ass
C at $1000 and class D $800.
The penalty for a violation of this is the
release of any player making complaint
from the club which has exceeded the
limit and the fining of the club guilty of
offense in the sum of $500. In case a club
refuses to pay this penalty the protection
of the National Association will be with
drawn from the league until satisfactory
arrangements have been made to assure
the payment.

During the ride up the mountain the
utmost amazement wag expressed at the
engineering skill developed in construct
ing "the crookedest road in the World."
One delegate from Wyoming declared that
a "big rattlesnake would break his buck
trying to climb along the rails."
When the "double bow knot" on the
road was reached and the full grandeur
of the view dawned en the excursionists
a Jolly party of staid bankers in the rear
scats of one of the trains arose in a body
and sang, "Oh, It Is Beautiful," para
phrasing a well-known church hymn.
Conductor I. A. Compere, who was in
charge of the train, Bald that if they
handled money like they did music he 1
The accommodations were perfect, and
not the slightest hitch occurred In the
transportation facilities. The day was
delightful, but, much to the disappoint
ment of the sightseers, a heavy*, fog drift
ed in through the straits, obscuring the
view of points in the distance. Before the
party left the summit the fog lifted suf
ficiently to give a good view of the ocean
and the lower part of San Francisco. To
the east a splendid idea of the configura
tion of the country could be gafned, and
the visitors feasted their eyes on the out
look. The cloud effects of the fog in the
valley below were beautiful, and 'the
women especially were in raptures over
the panorama, gleefully exclaiming; that
they were "above the fog at last."
Those of the visiting bankers and their
families who chose the trip to ; Mount
Tamalpais as the fitting climax to a pleas
ant "visit to San Francisco' and its envi
ronments went into ecstacies over their
experience yesterday. The ferry-boat left
its pier at 10 o'clock and landed its pas
sengers at Sausalito in time to connect
with two Bpeclal trains at Mill Valley
bound for the summit of the mountain.

BANKERS GO TO SAN JOSE.
Beauties of Santa Clara Valley De
light the Visitors.
The excursion to Palo Alto and San
Jose tendered to the visiting bankers by
the bankers of San Francisco yesterday
was a success In every way. The train
pulled out from the depot promptly at
9:15 a. m. with its complement of 400 pas
sengers. The first stop was made at Palo
Alto, where the visitors were shown the
Interiors of the beautiful chapel, the mu
seum and the library that form such im
portant factors, in the Leland Stanford Jr.
University. When' this inspection was
concluded, some fifty vehicles were
brought Into requisition, and the entire
party was driven about the spacious
grounds,' after which the train was again
boarded, and the objective point, San
Jose, was reached shortly after 1 o'clock.
Here, lined up in front of the depot, was
a magnificent collection of swell traps,
drags, four-in-hands and superb carts of
every kind and description, awaiting the
pleasure of the distinguished visitors. A
large majority of these private turnouts
were driven by their respective owners.
The party was immediately whirled out
to the Sor'osis fruit farm. Here the great
packing-room had been cleared out and
tables spread to accommodate 500 people.
The luncheon was sumptuous, and was
composed entirely of the products Of the
Santa'Clara Valley. The tables were rich
with wines and luscious fruits. Each
guest was presented with a bottle of El
Quito wine and one of El Quito olive oil.
The return drive to San Jose through the
orchards and , vineyards was a rare treat
in itself, and brought forth unbounded
praise from the visitors. A. Randolph
Howard, president of the Bank of Middle
sex of Fredericksburg, Va.. was most en
thusiastic over the trip. He said:
"This visit to the fruit regions of Cal
ifornia was a great revelation to us, and
the immense- wealth of this agricultural
district is amazing. This - excursion - has
been absolutely perfect. The hospitality
of California seems to be unbounded, and
the wonders of the State are certainly
limitless."

BANKEES VISIT ASTI.
It is universally acknowledged that the
visit of the King and Queen to Ireland
has been a great success. Much has been
written about the lavish beauty of the
Dublin street decorations, about the vast
crowds that lined the streets and about
the enthusiastic welcome given by thOM
crowds. Before" the excitement has all
died out, let us listen to remarks made
by units In the crowds. "Sure, he must
be as proud as Punch this minute; there
was niver a King that got such an re
ception, and sure he deserves it." "He's
a beautiful man. God bless him!" "Sure,
there's the Duke of Connaught. The poor
fellow! Good luck to him!" The King's
visit to the Guinness Trust buildings and
other tenements touched the hearts of the
dwellers In those .back streets, and will
for long be the great topic of conversa
tion. "Sure, he's a nice man. a rat*
glntleman. You'd know that by the way
he came walkin' up the lane, so quiet and
so simple." "Wait till I tell you what
two young girls did, and they all dressed
up In green. As soon as Iver he came
near them they shouted out. Three cheers
for Ireland!' and what'd he do but turn
round and take his h.at oft and shake it
at thlrn. and he breakln' his heart
laughin.' Oh! he's .a grand man .intire
ly!" "I declare I got so excited whin he
come ud that I don't know what I was
doin', leppin' up and down on the side of
the street and clapptn' me hands and
shoutln" 'God bless you! God bless you!'
and what'd he do but look me full In the
face and give me an lllgant salute." "To
think of him walkin' up into the houses
and spakSn' so friendly and not mindin'
a bit whin anny one made free wid htm.
let alone shakln" hands wid him! .: I de
clare he's beautiful. Anny one 'ud be fond
of him." Did you see the Quten. too?
And she dressed In a lovely violet boa
and a toque to match, and a white veil on
her; a beautiful young woman!" "I de
clare I spent, all me days ruanln* after

preferred to keep his savings In the
house.
The trip was the purest kind of a holl
. day proceeding. Business was entirely
forgotten, and the bankers and their fam
ilies fraternized with the crowd of tour
ists on the train and at the tavern, asking
'questions . and comparing views In the
most democratic fashion. C. A. Hunt of
the London, Paris and American Bank of
this city did everything In his power to
make the visiting bankers and their fam
ilies'appreciate-the enjoyable features of
the trip.
.A. lunch was served at the tavern, and
after^atiating themselves with the view
of the surrounding country the excursion
ists Reluctantly boarded the train and
went?! back to the city. Many of them
were so entranced with the beauty of the
scene that they waited over one train to
obtain fuller enjoyment of the unique ex.
perlence. Among the most enthusiastic ot
the visitors was L.. Drake, president of
the American National Bank of Omaha,
who was nearly won to missing his East
ern train in his desire to enjoy a longer
look from the top of the mountain.

Associated Banks' Statement.
The fruit market was quite active under the
usual Â«8aturday demand amonar retailers, who
were stocking up for the Sunday trade. Sup
plies however, were ample and prices were no
higher. Prices of table Grapes in small pack
ages ranged lower, as there were two days' re
ceipts on the market owing to the railroad
accident and the consequent delay of the
southern train . on the preceding day. Large
open boxes, too. were easier, and the top quo
tation was obtained only for strictly fancy
Muscat and Cornlchon. $1 being about the top
for the general run of supplies. J_Tokajr was the
weakest variety and Â«old slowly at 80Â®85c
There was very little Inquiry" for Wine Grapes
and off stock was offering freely below the quo
tations. Melons were plentiful and only
strictly fancy stock received -any attention.
With the exception of Figs, which were scarce
and firm, all descriptions of tree fruits were
plentiful and stood about a* previously quoted.
Raspberries were easier, as supplies, includ
ing Friday's belated arrivals, were large. The
canners reduced their bid to $3 per chest and
secured quite a quantity at that figure, straw
berries and Huckleberries were In ample sup
ply and unchanged. * Cranberries â¢ were steady
with stock* of Eastern well cleaned up.
There was nothing new to report In Citrus or
Tropical fruit*, supplies of all descriptions be
ing amole for requirements.
STRAWBERRIESâ Longworth*, - 14010 per
chest: Urge berries, $1 60Â®3.
RASPBERRIESâ $3Â®5 per chest.
Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The easy feeling already noted In Eggs was
again manifest. ' but there was , no actual de
cline. . The scarcity was less pronounced, how
ever, and every dealer had some cases for sale.
Largo retailers reported that some wholesalers
who have hitherto refused to sell under 55c are
now letting go at 63c, which shows the ten-
deney of the market. The public demand for
choice ranch has fallen off sharply since the
recent advance.
Butter and Cheese show no variation, both
being in sufficient supply for current needs.
Receipts were 14,100 lbs Butter. 650 cases
Eggs and 7100 lbs Cheese.

Prices of Potatoes were without quotable
change and trading In all descriptions was
rather quiet. There was a continued light
demand for cheap river Burbanks for ship
ment to the Southwest, but receipts were large
and continued in excess of the demand. Sweet
Potatoes were- In fr<xÂ».eupply and ruled weak
nt previous prices. There was nothing new In
Onions, supplies being more than sufficient for
requirements.
Trade In vegetables was active, but as sup
plies were unusually heavy prices of several
kinds ranged lower. Tomatoes were the weak
rst and most plentiful description and prices
had a wide range. The canners were not In
the market Â«nd there was a heavy surplus
unsold at the close of business. Marrowfat
Squash sold off well in a peddling way at 1
cent per pcund. while round lots were offering
at an easier figure on the wharf.

CHICAGO. Oct. 24. â Buying of both Decem
ber and May wheat by houses with St. Louis
connections was the feature in the wheat pit
and the demand from that source became ro
urgent with only light offerings that the mar
ket was strong throughout the day. Local
traders showed more disposition to buy than
for some time past, although there was noth
ing in the situation to warrant such action.
The only eemblance of bull factors was the
possibility of war In the Orient and the small
movement In the Northwest, but this was suf
ficient to create a strong demand. December
opentd %c lower to Vic higher at sr*gSOÂ»ie.
and soon after the opening, when the price
of December at St. Louis began to advance
by big strides, due to the congested condition
cf the market, the price here followed suit
and ruled strong the remainder of the session.
TTie high point was reached Just before the
close whÂ«n December sold up to 81%c. The
clo?e' was at 81H@91?Â»e. a gain of VÂ»@V;c for

Kansas lawyers feel that they must at
least make .a noise, use bis words and
make a show for their money. Recently
one had a divorce case in hand, and tha
petition which he filed read: "This faith,
ful and loving husband tried to soften
the asperity of his tumultuous wtfa with
extravagant sympathy, and in return he
received naught but opprobrious epithets."
Another Kansas divorce petition seta
forth that a woman can no longer live
with her husband because he insists on
reading dime novels when he should be
plowing corn.â New York Tribune.

fruit lntÂ«rests of the valley *could staf
fer. The Bay Cities Company has of-
fered to supply San Francisco and Oak
land with ICtXCCO.OOO gallons of water
dally and It was the firm determination
of the meeting- to prevent this if possible.
An injunction will be applied for In the
courts shortly.
It was reported at the meeting that a
notice was recently served* en the Bay
Cities Company that they must not take
the water out of the county and that If
they persisted the courts would be ap
pealed to. This, however, has had no ef
fect, as since the notice was served more
large wells have been commenced and the
work of development has Â»one right
along.
Two more claims to the water of Santa
Ctera County were filed to-day by E. G.
Wheeler, the promoter of the Bay Cities
Water Company. In the office of the
County Recorder. One is for 100.000 Inches
of .water in the Uvas Creek through the
Dunne ranch, and the other data?- 1SO.C00

in the vicinity of the Lion ranch. These
waters are to bÂ« conducted by means of
canals Into a big" reservoir to be built at
Coyote station. Dimensions of the canals
are to be sixty-five feet wide asd serea
feet deep. It is claimed the waters are to
be csed for irrigation purposes and for

cisco and Oakland. About 2Q0 of the
large property owners of the section af
fected were present at the meeting in

acres of land In the vicirAy of the water
cornpany's.Â«development work at Coyote

Cordes and D. L. Flyndt. The executive
committee will name a secretary and take
further steps to advance the organization.
Another, meeting will be shortly held at
the call of the chair.
A. T HerrmaniTmade a speech explain
ing the plans of the Bay Cities Company
and claimed that the erection of an un
derground dam at Coyote Station as pro
posed would rob the ranchers of the val
ley of their supply of water. It was
claimed the artesian wells would be af
fected and If the company was allowed to
la a plaster of paris' mold. After havlrg

departed. leaving word for his father to
come and sÂ«e me upon bis return and to

Â¦would explain the case as I. had femnd It..
"But at that time the. plaster of raris
method had Just been Introduced, and the
father was so pleased at the nice appear
ance of the limb that he asked rae to take
the case. This I gladly did. There was a
successful recovery.- no shortening of the
limb or . evil results, and this triumph
made my reputation la that .neighbor
hood. From this case I date the begin
ning cf my career.**
"I well remember my first case," *aid
another, "for it came only after long
and anxious waiting. At the beginning of
ay career I settled near the hospital,
-where I was an externe, to practice there
during Intervals In my professional duties.
But the presence of several old physicians
in the neighborhood, together with my ex
tremely youthful and Inexperienced ap
pearance handicapped me. and I was com
pelled to speed most of ray time at the
hospital. As this work was purely gratia
It gave little material . satisfaction.

A - STJCCESSnrL CASE.
"During the operation r sent the police
man for some whisky, and he soon re
turned with a Quart bottle. I adminis
tered a few teaspoonfuls to my patient,
and laughingly told the policeman to help
himself whenever he felt faint. He was a
brawny Irishman, and his occupation
should have destroyed any squeamish
weakness he might possess. But It was
marvelous the number cf times he felt it
necessary to resort to the bottle, and
at the end of the operation the bottle
was empty and the cop .was glorious.
"However, I am glad to say that my
patient recovered and my operation- was

"And the policeman **
"My first case," said another well
known physician, "was an amputation,
and that I was summoned was due en
tirely to my proximity to the place- of the
accident. It was late, about 3 o'clock,
and there was no other physician near,
and It Is to those favoring circumstances
I owe my first case.
"A policeman, at present well known In
this city, came for me and hurried me to
the scene. The patient had caught hi3
hand in a Gy-wheel and his arm was
crushed to the elbew. An immediate am
putation was necessary. But not know
ing- the nator* of the case when sum

had brought only a pocket case and did
not have the necessary Instruments for
the operation. However, perceiving a tool

secured a saw and with this accomplished
the amputation.
A BIBULOUS OFFICES.
"Shortly afterward I came to Washing

of my visitors was the negjo operated
upon, and I was humiliated .beyond ex
pression at the appearance of my first
successful case. Successful as far as the
healing Drocess was concerned, but a
pronounced Cyrano de Bergerac nose. The
skin had thickened, the nose did not have
the support I had expected and had drop

really whenever I saw the negro I would
Immediately turn In the opposite direc

"I felt very proud and highly e!ated
over the result and anxiously awaited the

that I was censpetent to undertake even
the most dellcat* operation. On his re

when I made the operation known as the
Indian method, selecting a leaf as a pat

of the greatest deformities that could
happen to mankind â a Ios3 of the noae.
I examined the condition very carefully,
thought over the authorities I had read
on the subject and informed the patient
that I could easily make him a new nose
of any form desired. I asked him what
shape he preferred â Roman, African or
pug. He replied that it did not make any
difference, so that the hole in his face
was covered. Next morning I met my

*'ily duty as an assistant was sim-pry to

I most certainly- was not trusted by the

I secure patients who would trust me. In
the special department of surgery my
preference was for that known as plas

like all other public men, have dif

demonstrate their ability," said a prom
inent surgeon whose name la a house
hold word in Washington. "My inclina

operation was humorous in the extreme.
In my earlier professional life I had few
opportunities to gratify my desire â I

"FLEEING FROM THE FLAMES,"
A trild. unreasoning' panic often seizes r pea Ben ia tlie presence ct
danger, or even wh.en danger is only imagined. Among the lover ani-
mals the greater the intelligence they possess the xacre they axe sub-
ject to tenor. It is said that elephants tremble at the sight of a noes*.
and horses, -which are credited with more intelligence thaa most domes-
tic animals, show more fear.
In the picture of Adolpb. Schreyer, reproduced in The Call art sup-
plement, there is vividly depicted a stampede cf tenpr - stridden horses
from a bnrning stable. In their blind gallop into the darkness they have
crashed into a barrier and are plunging and struggling in confusion,
some entangled In the splintered wood, while ethers crowd upon, t^^^n, It
is a scene which gave the artist abundant opportunity for dramatic effect
and vigorous action. He has also displayed his ability as a colorist. In
its variety and richness cf color the greatest merit lies, asd its color
makes this picture one of the artist's masterpieces.
' Bomantic tendencies are strong in all of Schreyer's painting, and
' sentiment, color and effect were more important to hin than, accurate
draftsmanship. He possessed the power to express strongly what he felt
â¢ more than the ability to depict truthfully what he saw.
"Fleeing From the Flames*' is owned by the Chicago Art Institute,
and is included in the splendid collection bequeathed to the museum, by
the late Albert A. Hunger in rS98.
Reproduction of one other picture by the same artist, ''The Arab
Scout," has been issued by The Sunday Call, and biographical notes

PERSONAL MENTION.
Frank E. Golden, a prominent Nevada
Jeweler, being the owner of â¢ stores in
Reno, Carson City and Tonopah, filed a
suit yesterday for $40,000 damages against
O. A. Turner, a promoter of the famed
Tonopah mines. He bases his suit' on al
leged breach of contract on the part of
Turner, alleging that the latter In failing
to keep his promise to sell him stock, In
the Tonopah Mining Company caused him
to suffer a loss : of the amount sued for.
It appears from the complaint that Tur
ner, v in July, 1901, agreed to sell Golden
2500 shares of common and 2500 shares .'of
preferred stock in the Tonopah Mining
Company, a corporation formed in Penn
sylvania by Turner. Golden' says he paid
$250 to Turner to bind th$Â» bargain, rely
ing on the latter's promise , to ,' give him
the stock as soon as he: returned from
Philadelphia. The stock, alleges 'Golden,
was issued in September and he demanded
that Turner keep his promise. The'lat
ter refused, according to Golden, with' the
result that he ' lost ; a profitable invest
ment.

called attention to the necessity of offi
cers being prompt with all papers which
must be transmitted and said all papers
should; be absolutely correct. No officer,
said he, should affix his signature to any
paper unless sure that it was absolutely
correct, for the- honor and integrity of an
organization depends upon the correct
ness of all signed papers. If this sugges
tion Is carried out it will put a stop to
the method Jn many units in the past of
signing reports that show fifty on parade

twenty, he said.
Next Wednesday Colonel "Wilhelm will
visit the armory in Oakland, where he
.will inspect Companies A and F of Oak

fantry, and then give the officers and the
men a talk on military, duty.
If ideas that have been expressed are
carried out there will be a difference In
the . methods followed by the lieutenants
In the different bodies of the guard. It
has been observed that In many instances
they are too timorous and more apologetic
than commanding. .It, has been observed
that instead of directing the 7 men, A3 the
tactics expect they should, they approach
the me,n , and ; whisper that which they
seem to be/afraid to express In a manner
that Is expected of them. It Is thought

He gave his ideas in the matter of im
proving the guard as a whole, and, .while
he admitted that there were units â¢ that
were, deserving; , of Â¦; commendation, still
there -; was . so ; much that ..was not. good
that it tainted the ", whole, organization.

said " the recruit" should be instructed in

he is a soldier.' The fact that he is told he
is a soldier does not make him oneâ he
must be trained : in setting-up exercises

the care company commanders should be
stow upon their men, which is of Â¦ far
more importance than it is to teach them
"fours right" and "fours left" in the arm
ory, , he held.. .The best commander, he
saidj; is the one who looks after the wel
fare of his, men.
The men' in the ranks are those who are
to be depended upon In time of need, and
it is most essential that they should be
looked after and taught how to take care
of themselves, whether in the armory or
on the field. Company commanders, : . he
eaid.* should devote attention to Instruct
ing, the officers, and men In the duties of
sentinels, and that on drill: nights men
from the ranks should be posted for the
purpose â¢ of . ascertaining 1 what they - do
know, 5 and ; if they are ; deficient* to give

The judges were Thomas F. Graham,
Thomas F. Dunn and Louis T. Hengstler.
Judge Graham, when announcing the
decision, stated that tne debating was
very 'even, but that the decision should
go to the Commercial Evening School, as
their team work and delivery was far su
perior to that of their opponents.
The debaters from the Commercial
Evening School were Louis T. Diebels,
Adolph Becker and Walter E. Trefts.
The winning team was loudly cheered
end applauded when the judges an
nounced the decision.
The Lowell High School's representa
tives were Lewis K. Underhill, Henry
Mehrtens and Maurice E. Harrison, who,
though defeated, put up a splendid ar
gument and spoke in a manner that
showed they were thoroughly familiar
Â¦with the subject under discussion.
The balcony at the rear of the audito
rium was crowded with rooters from
both schools, and as each speaker ad
dressed the audience he was greeted with
three cheers and the school's yell and a
general "rough house."
The affirmative side was presented by
the Lowell High School, while the Com

ENGAGE IN DEBATE
La Grille is a carpenter, and a few days
p.r>, made application for a union card.
He is a good-looking man of about 15
yecirs, 5 feet 8 Inches in height and weighs
about 145 pounds. He is well dressed and
has the appearance of a professional man.
He says that he Is from Memphis, Term.
The officers could find no trace of the
badge, and La Grille admitted that he
threw it away a few days ago when he
became suspicious of inquiring persons.
La Grille maneuvered around Loa An
geles for a while longer and finally left
;with the woman for tht^ city. Before
; leaving he showed Thomas a supposed
r $20,000 United States bond and promised to
i have It cashed as soon as he reached San
. Francisco and send Thomas 5200 he owed
elm for board. Thomas Is still awaiting
the arrival of the money.
When La Grille left Los Angeles the
United States Secret Service agent was
notified to look out for him. Hazen got a
clew, and last evening he spotted his man
at Third and Market streets. He was
followed to his room at 770 O'Farrell street
and placed under arrest.
La Grille made no resistance, but asked
Hazen to be careful when searching him
and not touch a wound over his heart.
Hazen looked at the alleged wound and
became suspicious. Finally he tore off a
piece of plaster on La Grille's chest, but
could find no scar. f
The prisoner then admitted that he had
been faking all the time, and his woman
companion was very much surprised when
the officers pulled off the plaster, for she
Â¦was under the impression that La Grille
. was suffering from a wound that nearly
cost him his life.
L& Grille first Cashed bis badge on a
L/cs Angelea druggist, when, ho secured
some medicines and plasters for a sup
posed wound received during a conflict
with counterfeiters In Mexico. Shortly
after this he went to the home of Ben
jamin Thomas in Los Angeles and made
arrangements for room and board at the
place.
He went there, he said, on recoxnmenda
tloa of Mrs. Bessie Porch, who was stop

he threw it wide. Just as the children had

After ceven or eight hundred yard dashes
of the kind, the youngsters, perspiring

clasped him around the waist and begged
to be let off from further play. Then the

RECALLS THE LOVE OF BALFOUR'S YOUTH
DAUGHTER OF GERMAN EMPEROR, WHO. IS BEING TAUGHT TO COOK: HER MOTHER, THE EMPRESS,
WHO SUPERINTENDS HER INSTRUCTION IN PRACTICAL HOUSEWIFERY; HER BROTHER AND PLAY
MATE, PRINCE JOACHIM, AND THE ROYAL PALACE AT POTSDAM. . _.' - .
Chester's purchase of Kylemore Castle
continues to be a nine- day wonder. Tha
World's correspondent now hears that tt
was wholly the enterprise of the youn?
Duchess, who Insisted on acquiring tha
place in the teeth of the strongest oppo
sition of her father and of her husband's
mother. The transaction was carried out
by Mitchell Henry's son. Lorenzo, who is
an old and Jntimate friend of the Zim
merman family, wRsm he frequently vls-
Ued in Cincinnati. He has known tha
Duchess since she was a child.
The Duke Is a mere cipher In the house
hold, where the Duchess is established as
absolute mistress. The purchase money
for the castle (about 5300.000) was paid
only In part, $150,000 remaining on mort
gage.
As she is the only girl in so big and bo
affectionate a family, and Is besides the
youngest of the Kaiser's seven children,
Princess Victoria Louise Adelaide Ma
thllde Charlotteâ to'give her the full bene
fit of her nameâ would be badly spoiled
If It were not for her father's stern super
vision. Even as It Is, Bhe is an uncom
monly lively and headstrong little miss,
and time and again has made things un
comfortable for palace servants whose
duty it is to keep her under restraint and
never to let her out of their sight for a
second, day or night.
She delights especially In the farm life
at Cadinen, and used to dodge her at
tendant and slip away to the farmyards
whenever possible. One day last summer
when the Empress, had callers the. Prin
cess, bubbling with pleasure, dashed sud-'
denly into the drawing-room with a lit
tle pink object squeezed tight In her arms.'
Before any one could interfere she had
unceremoniously dropped her burden. Into
her, imperial mother's lap. The Empress,
who was wearing a choice gown, was not
overjoyed to find herself holding a suck
ing pig, and the guests gave up In despair
their attempts. to swallow their laughter.
The Empress got rid of the. pig as soon
as possible, and retired in haste to change
her dress. The Princess was ordered off
to her room In disgrace. What happened
to her there is a court secret.
The Princess has a tender heart, how
ever, and great confidence in her mother's
charitableness. She was deeply touched
the other day when walking out with her
governess by the distress of an old
woman who was weeping ostentatiously
In tho royal path. It appeared on ln
quffcy that the bereaved dame had lost
"her only cow," and had naught, left in
the world. The Princess felt in her pock
ets In vain for. stray coins, and the gov
erness declined to assist. :. V: ! '.
"Well," said the little girl, sympa
thetically, to the old woman, "you really,
mustn't cry any more now,' 'specially as
my mother is coming, and she â¢ will buy
you a nice new cow. She's not like my
father's loyal subjects â¢ lift their hats in
salute.' The most popular picture of the
little Princess is that showing her upon
the lap of the Crown Prince, her brother,
surrounded by her other five brothersâ a
devoted and astonishingly good looking
set of royal children.
SOMEWHAT WILLFUL.
Many Interesting stories of the Kaiser's
children are afloat in the Fatherland, but
none is more eagerly retold and none so
common as those which indicate the wide
personal Interest which their Majesties
have always taken in the upbringing of
their big family. The Kaiser especially
has ideas about the efficacy of example.
It Is related of Princess Victoria Louise
and Prince Joachim, the youngest of the
children, that they were once playing a
game of ball in the palace yard at Pots
dam, at a point where they were directly
under their father's eye as he sat at a
window smoking his morning cigar. His
Majesty noticed that the favorite feature
of the game seemed to be throwing the
ball wide, in order that a sentry on duty
near by, in a spirit of royal obedience,
would each time have to chase it and re
turn the ball to the hands of one of. the
royal players. In the course of fifteen
minutes the faiu-ful sentry, the Kaiser
noticed, would be obliged to perform this
act as many as ten or a dozen timesâ a
somewhat fagging exercise for a man
As an only girl, of course, the Princess
has come In for an unusual amount of
personal attention from her mother, and
Is on that account a somewhat more than
model Sunday school scholar, for her Ma
jesty is deeply religious and of most char
itable and philanthropic Instincts. Indeed,
the Kaiserin's personality is little known
In German life beyond routine court ac
tivities and her constant affiliation with
church and sociological endeavor.
A favorite amusement of this busy lit
tle Princess is to visit the village school
at Cadinen and listen to the exercises.
She takes the liveliest interest in the
arithmetic classes and is accustomed to
nod her head approvingly when a small
pupil answers a question put by the
teacher and which the Princess knows is
correct. Like all royal children of ten
der years, Victoria Louise's training so
far has been at home at the hands of
private tutors. Besides the three R's
and the neyr cooking venture, she has al
ready become adept at plain sewing, and
gives promise of decided piano talent,
while a course in horseback riding, of
which her mother is passionately fond,
and of pony driving are i en her coming
year's programme.

Echloss.
Visitors to the beautiful castle gardens
of Potsdam in the spring and summer of
any of the past three or four years have
often encountered Victoria Louise wheel-
Ing her doll family about in, dainty white
end-gold baby carriages as earnestly as
the most serious mamma In the Fatherland,
stopping now to tuck away at the quilts,
then stealing a fervent kiss from some
blue-eyed waxen figure beneath them. But
the Erapress, true to her own domestic'
Ideals, and those indeed of every typical
German mother, thinks the time has
come to fit the Princess out for real
household duties, and the miniature kitch
en at Potsdam is the immediate result.

MODEL KITCHEN.
Her kitchen is a model on a reduced
6cale of the court kitchen. It Is equipped
with a tiny range of Its own, with sink
end racks of utensils, barrels, boxes and
chests, just as one finds them In the typi
cal, well-ordered German hausfrau's es
tablishment. It Is understood the Princess
Intends spendlns two hours in her kitchen
each forenoon, with the faithful and ex
pert Huebner at her elbow exposing the
Fecrets of the humbler recipesâ tea, coffee,

v.-ants her to get the fundamental princi
ples of the chefs business first.
None of her Royal Highness' productions
has yet reached the imperial dinner ta
ble, ss far as the public's knowledge
goes, but I am told that the Princess has
affectionately warned her father and
mother that the is going to surprise them
EhortJy with something ell her ownâ and
epoch-making will be the day wtten she
".tries it on" her fond parents and broth
,crs. As the only girl In the Kaiser's big
family of boys, Victoria Louise has al
v.ays been very much of a pet and favor
ite, and it Is rsie to assume that the
Kraiser will watch her progress at the
pans and kettles v.Ith almost as much
I aternal interest as h*>. bestows upon the
development and destinies of his tine
navy.
The cooking lessons were suddenly in
urrupted a few weeks ago owing to an
outbreak of scarlet fever among some of
ttie castle Fervants, necessitating the re
moval of the court to the Kaiser's flne
country place at Cadir.cn. As a consola-
Uan^ for the loss of culinary Instruction,

Princess Victoria Louise is about to
emerge from the doll and dollhouse stage
of her brief career, which numbered
eleven years exactly a week ago. Her
mother has humored her, of course, in
this most feminine of pastimes, and many
are the stories of how her Royal Highness

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1903.
Pages 49 to 52* It has been several years since an actor
and a play have been accorded the hearty,
spontaneous and unanimous praise that
greeted Richard Mansfield in "Old Heidel
berg" on the occasion of the first pres
entation Monday, October 12. Our actor
not only raised his audience to a high
pitch of enthusiasm, but the critical fac
ulty fell in as they have not for Mansfield
or any other actor , heretofore. They
agreed that Prince Karl , Heinrich is the
most charming' as well as the most ' ar
tistic creation of Mansfield's since "Beau
Brummel," and "Old Heidelberg" they
stamped as the best comedy of a genera
tion. "Impersonations of wilder, stormier
force he has often accomplished," writes
William Winter, "but, , as ; the. old Â¦ fable
aptly. teaches, the sun is stronger than the
wind; the highest power is marked not by
violence, but by serenity. Achievements
of this order maintain 'the dignity of the

ker of the Sun, among many enthusiastic
bursts, said: "Mansfield seemed very
youthful. He is quite slender and romped
gayly over the scene. His wig Is auburn
and he kissed his sweetheart so long, so
lingeringly that henceforth the 'Mansfield
kiss' shall be blazoned in history with the
Abbott and Nethersole kisses." The im
personal critic of the Telegram wound
up a three column paean with this tooth
some paragraph? "To the disillusionized
and the world weary 'Old Heidelberg' is
recommended. It will drive away the
blues, it will bring back summer and the
sun and those dear lost days of one's
tropic youth." Whoever writes on the
Herald said: "It was the universal ver
dict at the last curtain that a more ar
tistic, reljned and finished production of
a play of the kind has rarely if ever been
given In New York. Through all moved
the central and lovable figure of the
young Prince, splendidly played by a fin
ished actor in full sympathy by training,
association and feeling- with his role." A
scholarly, scribe on the Press liked every
thing as well as his fellow critics and re
ferred to "Mansfield's amazing versatility
and inexhaustible \ resource," and the
World thought "Mansfield was at his
best in 'this brilliant play, so charming
ly produced." In the Evening World
there was a patter of superlativesâ "As
actor and manager he fairly outdid him
self. â¢ â¢ * There wasn't an instant when
Mansfield wasn't supreme."
This critic had. a good deal to say
about the Mansfield kiss, too. Â¦ In the
Times was a scholarly report. It was
keenly appreciative of the fundamental
human note in "Old Heidelberg" and of
the artist's grasp of the many opportuni
ties for differentiation. Among other
things he said: "Mr. Mansfield's Karl
Heinrich is a worthy portrait In a gal-,
lery of worthy portraitsâ one which will
possess a permanent charm for all those
who love good acting, who can enjoy in
the theater something more than a pret
ty story, prettily told and who find
pleasure In the revelation of a character
study that is as convincing as It Is
charming.". ,A11 in all, t!here has not In
years been such unanimity in praise of
a player and play. Mansfield . remains in
New York only until November 9. Then
he goes to Pittsburg for a week on the
way to Chicago. On his way to Boston
for the holidays he plays "Old Heidel
berg" in ; Buffalo,- Rochester, Syracuse
and Albany. In January and February
he plays the larger cities of the Atlantic
seaboard and New Orleans. St.* Louis,
Cincinnati and Cleveland . will also see
"Old Heidelberg" in the. spring, and
then Mansfield goes to San Francisco,
where he appears for the first time in
nine ; years.
And then, after I had learned his ideal
and hobby, I discovered the dream of
Mr. Edesonâ truly notable. It is some
day, when he is rich enough, to find an
American Stephen. Phillips to write a po
etic Indian play, and to produce it In all
possible beauty. " "Not that I wish to
act In it," he said, "but that would be
my way of contributing something, to the
American drama."
"And what did you do with them?" Mr.
Edeson gravely Indicated -the cavaliers
in attendance.
"Took them with us," Mrs. Edeson
laughed.
"You are braver .than I, gentlemen,"
he bowed, as with " Miss Tennant they
went out again into the morning sun
shine.
Mrs. Edeson told me then several things
that her husband had neglected to men
tion, one that his chief hobby was pic
ture "making. In their home at Sag
Harbor he has a great studio under the
roof, covering the entire space of the
house, where he betakes ' himself and
makes things beautiful sometimes, but
always Interesting to the painter.
"You do not tell about my portrait that
you threw out of the window," the actor
added, looking proudly at the little lady
at his side. "I painted a portrait of my
self In a mirror, that I thought the finest
thing that ever happened. She threw it
out of the window."
"It wasn't like you a bit," Mrs. Edeson
murmured.
Then, tiny and plump, and with a dark,
vivacious face, and brilliant gray eyes,
little Mrs. Edeson (Ellen Burg) came In,
followed by slim Dorothy Tennant, Mr.
Stirling and another member of the
Edeson company.
"She has bought only fourteen dresses
and sixteen hats," Miss Tennant gaily
told Mrs. Edeson's husband.
"No, I'm not built for it." and then he
made the critical appreciation before al
luded to as to his "baby grand piano
legs." "Why should every one want to
do Shakespeare? One is always up against
an impossible ideal In attempting it, to
begin with. That is not fair to the actor.
One remembers only the good" of former
players, the Booths, Barretts, McCuI

OF THE AMERICAN DRAMA, AND A SCENE FROM THE DRAMATI
ZATION OF "BEN HUR.".
"That book, by the way," indicating
the London book, "contains one of the
strongest ideas for a play that I know
of. If the author had the genuius to
take a man, put him through the same
experiences, relatively, as those through
which the dog of the book goes, he would
have one of the strongest plays ever writ
ten."
"Wouldn't it border on the problem
play that I understand you do not like?
You don't like them?"
"Hate 'em like the deuce â pardon me;
there's some slang one can't deny one
self. One has to use it and apologize
after," he ingeniously put it. "But I
think not as to the play. No, I don't
like problem plays. Maeterlinck, Suder
mann, and so on. I neither like nor un
derstand them. I . eet back after them
to a Rood American cowboy and say,
'Thank God, there are such people." I
believe you should keep the morgue and
the sewer off the stage."
"And yet you are not at all against the
matinee Kirl's hero."
Mr. * Edeson looked hurt as he said:
"There are no more matinee girls."
I dragged up several examples of the
caramel contingent near home, only to be
met with: "They've all gone, then, to the
ten, twenty and thirty houses. The high

no more a worshiper of the man beau

By the way," he laughed genially, "did
you see that Billy Faversham was 111?
No? It was In to-day's paper. And what
pf do you think? He is a great matinee
hero. Of all the unromantic thingsâbil

me."
"How did you come to be an actor?"
I asked.
"Well, I was no good at anything else,"
Mr. Edeson owned. "I tried everything.
I was a nice boy, I believe, but didn't care
to work. I had ranched in Texas, done
all sorts of outdoor things, and ). could i
not settle down to commercial monotony.
The direct way of my coming to the
stageâ the story has the fringe of the
press agents â was through newspaper
work. I used to do , the theaters for fua

is his strongest characteristic.
"Yes, I want American characters and
American plays," the actor said earnest
ly. "I have just made arrangements now
for the dramatizing of an American
storyâ Califomian-made, by the way, 'The
Conjuror's House,* by Stewart Edward
White."
"I'm ashamed to say I don't know it."
"Fine story,'* the actor said. "Hudson
Bay story, 600 miles from anywhere. And
White's lived it all. Do you know, him?
No? He's a bully, corking American!
I've just been at his place in Santa Bar

him. It was about this play. There wai
some misunderstanding and I telegraphed
him to come to me at Baltimore. He
came. He had on a rattlesnake hat, that
he told me he had not had time to change.
We settled up the business in ten min
utesâwe're neither of us business men.
He sat on one side of the table, I on the
other, and wrote each other a letter.
That was all. Thenâ White is seemingly
a thinnlsh chap, ndt strongâ I asked him

"That's his book," and Edeson nodded
to the top of the little desk at which he

the circumstances may warrant. There
are very enthusiastic reports concerning
not alone the quality of "Mile. Napoleon,"
but the magnificence with which Mr.

Before John Drew terminates his en

It may be said that the dramatic topic
of the season thus far in New York has
been the appearance of Mrs. Fiske in
Ibsen's "Hedda Gaoler" at the Manhat
tan Theater. This Is the second Ibsen
play in which Mrs. Fiske has won dis
tinguished success, the first being "A
Poll's House." Her success in "Hedda
Gabler," however, has been most remark
able from all viewpoints, transcending
that of any player in an Ibsen drama in
this country. And having carried into
effect a long contemplated design to ap
pear in this play, Mrs. Fiske, when op
portunity offers, will produce another Ib
sen drama, "Rosmersholm," in which
also her success may be predicted. "R/js
mersholm" is even stronger in its appeal
than "Hedda Gabler," and the character
of Rebecca West, In which Mrs. Fiske
will be seen, Is probably unequaled among
Ibsen's women roles for its strength and
dignity, while it has a wider sympathy
than most of his other women.
Now Miss SchenT can speak English as

Box office figures are not in the best of
repute, so that when occasionally you find
honest and truthful ones they are chary
about thrusting themselves forward for
fear they will be treated with the con
tumely that their less scrupulous fellows
have brought on the whole class, and
for that reason it is difficult to make dear
the unprecedented success that Maxine
Elliott has made at the Garrick Theater,
New York, in Clyde Fitch's best play,
"Her Own Way." The theater is crowd
ed to its Utmost at every performance and
every record for the amount of money
received through the box office window
has been completely eclipsed. To meet
the demand Wednesday matinees were in
augurated last week and the theater was
crowded just the same. In the audience
of 1909 people on Wednesday afternoon
there were only ten men present. V

performance in the city prison. The pa

I^ackaye, who happened to be in town, re
marked: 'Smith ought to be satisfied
now, for he has an audience at last that
can't get away.' "
Now, "Warfleld goes farther In regenera

Macklin played the part along the lines

Warfield insists that the unpopular Ve

merely actuated by an honorable desire
to get all that "was coming to him."
Previously to Macklin's time. Shylock
had always been represented as a funny
old man wearing three hats and bearing
a low comedy knife with which to scrape
Antonio's wishbone. The failure of his
plans was always discounted by the audi
ence, which regarded the situation, not
as a catastrophe averted, but merely as a
ludicrous episode.

Macklin, tho associate of Kitty Clive, Peg

been supposed that most of the profits of
amusement enterprises were derived from
their tours outside the metropolis. More
over, "Belasco himself has been carrying
through the country in the oompletest
possible fashion some of the very heaviest
dramatic productions ever shown upon
the American stacre.
Many of these have drawn enormous
audiences, and it was generally supposed
that the author-manager was entirely
satisfied with the results of his labors in
ottfer cities as well as New York. Ques
tioned upon the subject the other even

IT WAS beautifully apropos; almost
miraculously to. ThÂ» thine could
not have been better stage managed
by David Belasco himself. But for
the almost Impossible unstaginess of
Mr. Edeson, who is "Bob." one- might
even have suspected rehearsal.
It was this way. When I betook myself
to Mr. Edeson's hotel, the elevator boy,
receiving credentials of my right to be,
and there, trustfully pointed out "room
SO. to the right." He did not seem to think
It necessary to waste the card that I was
lightly fingering, and who was I to doubt
his judgment? Bo to "room Â£0" I went,
and meekly did my own* knocking. ,\. Â¦
"Come in," the cheerful Edeson voice
said, to a probable ganymede with ice
water.
"I"â I hesitated, slightly opening the
door.
"Oh!*' said Mr. Edeson, flinging it wide
open. "You are â of course â yes! Come
in."
He stood there, coatless, looking in his
breezy negligeeâ gray- tweed and tan
shoe? as to his lower lengths, blue tie and
lightly-striped soft shirt for the rest â as
well as a clean-limbed, bravely-shouldered
American gentleman may, and as finely
unconscious of the fact. It was the Gib
son-Davis Ideal to the letter. OnÂ© even
glanced Involuntarily around for a som
brero and a neat gun, but found only a
pair of heavily beaded moccasins that Mr.
Edeson later confessed to finding very
comfortable. I was quite regretful when
the actor be-tweeded his broad shoulders
t'Â» match what he uncivilly calls his
"baby prand piano less." but acutely con
vinced that the former picture had not
been posed.
Mr. Edeson was by way of being de
lighted with his and "The Soldiers of
Fortunes" reception of the evening
leforeâ this was Tuesdayâ not more de-
Ifphtr-d than surprised, however. West
ern judgment had developed even more
than its usual piquant novelty, he con
fessed, and dropped into his coat, a chair
ar.d the discussion at the same time.
"Pleased? Delighted:" he replied, as I
asked if their San Francisco welcome had
not satisfied the Edeson company. Then,
v.ith his quick, boyish. Infectious laugh,
that begins and ends anywhere and
everywhere, he said: "Perhaps you can
not understand jwst how pleased we are.
You can't! For you haven't played
through the woods from Texas here!"
"Too true," I confessed.
"Curious what a difference it makes,
â¢playing up' to San Francisco and down
from it"â
" 'Playing up? 1 "
"Oh. beginning with the smaller towns
instead of San Francisco," Mr. Edeson
explained, settling comfortably into his
chair. He flung his arm lightly over the
back of it. crossed his legs in charac
teristic attitude, all to the furtherance
of the Gibson illusion. "San Francisco
sets the time for all the West," he went
on, "no doubt of it. Though we were
successful enough on the road, it would
have made a considerable difference if
we had played here first. And we felt
somehow that we did not know Jus! where
we stood last night. We were all as nerv
ous as could beâ you think not?"
I had looked a little natural Incredulity
as I recalled the sparkling performance
of the evening before.
â¢ "Wait until you have played one night
stands from Texas to here," Mr. Edeson
threatened, then repeated and empha
sized. "We were all nervous, but the
thing began to go so well that we soon
felt it was all right. Then came the sur
prise. Do you know that San Francisco
Is the only place where our last act fell
flat?"
"Noâ nor why you should look so
amused about it?" I queried. The actor's
clear, direct eyes held unmistakable ap
proval.
"Becauseâ well. I think that way my
self. " he said, flinginc up his head in a
hrave. boyish way. Mr. Edeson's sturdy
honesty is not his least marked trait.
"Not that the act could well be differ
ently handled. But I said to my wife
last night in the middle of it, 'They're
on to the act.' and you were. Other
places, too, they have cried In the third
act, where the President's wife throws
the people's money back to them while
Hope waves the auction flag out of the
window!"
"And we didn't?"
"You didn't." Mr. Edeson echoed with
sympathy. "The first two acts are of
course the brst."
"They are excellent" â
"And really, the others usually carry,"
he continued. "But it needs a snap and
zip that weren't there last night. What
mi it that appealed to you as particular
ly inconsistent, by the way?"
"For one thing, the charming insouci
ance with which Miss Langham and King
make love while Miss Langham's sister
Â«s !n danger of her life, and the collected
ness of Papa Langhamâ whose anxiety
about some impending tamales under the
same circumstances is truly touching.
Also, their picnicky way of saving their
own fkins while the young girl's fate is
still undecided." I replied. "And why, by
thp way, did Mr. Thomas decide to ignore
Mr. Davis' fact that Clay's first love was
Alice LAngham?"
Mr. Edcson's manner boded the reply
unanswerable as he said: "Well, do you
like the vacillating man?"
I couldn't help it, and blandly answered,
"Yes, why not?"
My reward was immediate in a delight
ful gasp from the actor. He sat up very
straight, opened his gray-blue eyes their
widest. then slapped his knee and
laughed: "Well, I never heard a woman
fray that before. If it had been, a man
nowâ. But that is why Mr. Thomas
changed the stors", the average dislike â "
"Feminine â "
"Feminine, for the vacillating man," he
closed, and set me down a type â mea
culpa!
"You have been a Thomas' hero before,
Mr. Edeson."
"I -was the first Denton In 'Arizona,' "
he replied simply.
Then I remembered that before me,
after Nat Goodwin, was the strongest,'
most distinctively American personality
on the stage, that Mr. Edeson's ideal Is
the exploitation of the purely American
character, and his dream the encourage
ment of the purely American drama.
Then it was that I asked him concerning
these things.
"The American, pure and simple, al
ways appealed to me. ' Why not? There
Isn't anything on earth better than a
good American." he said, and I wondered
if there was anywhere a more earnest
American face as he said It. "The out
of-door American particularly appeals to

Americanism more strongly in London,

"I think, though, that xny London ex

Edeson's broad shoulders straightened
over lungs that have drunk deep of the
wide air of the prairies, his eyes deepen-
In a barren valley Amrah comes upon
the leper mother and sister. She Im
plores them to go with her to meet the
Savior. They consent, and on the road
pass Ben-Hur, who, worn out with seek
ing them, has fallen asleep on a rock.
Tirzah stoops to kiss him. Her mother
draws her back and whispers "Unclean "
The lepers and their faithful servant
kneel and pray upon the hillside. The
Christ Is not visible, but a great radiance
that emanates from him floods the pic
ture. It falls upon the kneeling figures.
The hideous whiteness of the lepers
changes to the hue of health. They rise
proclaiming themselves healed. Ben-Hur
leads Esther to them. She kisses the
women. A chorus of "Hosanna, Ho
sanna, Hosanna, In the Highest," closes
the scene and the play.
To Ben-Hur In the old palace of the
Prince of Hur comes Amrah, the ser
vant who has followed the sad fortunes
of the Prince's outcast mother and sister
She kneels before him and tells him that
they have become lepers. The grief of
the Prince at this new and greatest blow
Is pitiful. He remembers that the Narza
rene has healed such Ills as these. "With
Amrah he sets forth to find him;
Iras, a beautiful and dangerous Egyp
tian, in whose company the young HeÂ«
brew Is, notes this look and smiles. But
Iras knows well her power. She hears a
desert sheik invite Simonldes. E3tnpr
and Ben-Hur to a feast. She sees Ben-
Hur follow the father and daughter from
the tent, but leans back easily among her
cushions, toys with the silken fringe of
her tunic and softly sings. Ben-Hur hears,
flushes and turns back and Joins the
Egyptian- charmer. Simonldes screens
Esther's eyes as Ben-Hur floats past In
an Egyptian barge, with Iras, among her
cushions, Btlll smiling and softly singing.
The picture of the exterior and great
gateway of the circus of Antioch comes
next. Messala has seen Iras and coveted
her smiles. Ben-Hur, angry at the small
triumphs of the man who had so deeply
injured him, remonstrates with the lady.
Angry In turn, dazzled also by the Ro
man scarlet and gold, Iras discards Ben-
Hur for thÂ© Roman, and the Hebrew's
Ecore Is yet one deeper against Messala.
Then we see the arena. The Jew and
the Roman are driving for what la
sweeter to them than their livesâ revenge.
Messala bends far over his 'chariot. His
horses seem to have wings. He is ahead.
He shouts triumphantly. Ben-Hur too
leans far over his chariot. His Arabian
horses plunge forward in a grand "spurt"
and pass the goal. The Jew has won.
and the curtain falls upon the flush of
his victory.
The ship is then attacked and sinks.
Ben-Hur seizes the wounded tribune In
his arms and Jumps with him into the
sea.
The next scene la In the house of SI
monldes, an aged merchant of Antioch.
Simonldes is lamenting that his magnifi
cent surroundings are a mockery. "Slave
you are In spite of all," they seem to
shriek at him. He confides the secret of
his slavery to his daughter, Esther. "Rich
as we are, you and I and all of this be
longs to. the house of Hur." he say3.
Esther kneels and prays.
Then follows the picture of the Grove
of Daphne, wherein beautiful nymphs
weave their spells. It is to this grove
that Simonldes and Esther have Jour
neyed In their search for Ben-Hur.
Prayer had shown Esther her and her
father's duty. They must find their
owner, and render up themselves and
their riches to him. In the Grove of
Daphne they meet Ben-Hur, returned
from the seas. He Is touched by tha
magnanimity of their sacrifice. He raises
the father and daughter to their feet,
looking reverently and tenderly at
Esther.
A Roman officer appears and looks In
differently at the crew, his careless eye
stopping at the Jew's figure. He per
ceives that Ben-Hur Is a man of gentle
blood and asks him of what crime he is
accused. Ben-Hur tells him, and also
states that he Is innocent. "They all say
that," replies the tribune; "go back to
your oar â but forward there. Unlock
this man's chains."
Next follows the picture of the galley
In which Ben-Hur Is chained. The interior
of the big brown vessel Is shown. The
slaves at either end, half naked, each
handling a single great oar. show white
against it as the cloth wrapped about
their weary bodies. A big. brutal Roman
sits on a low platform, beating time for
the strokes of the oars.

clash inevitably comes, Messala leaving
In hot anger. Looking then from the roof
on a passing procession of Roman sol
diers, Ben-Hur and hl3 sister see that a
stone has been thrown and has felled a
soldier. In an Instant the cry is raised-
It seems to come from Messala â "that
stone was thrown by Ben-Hur, the Jew."

TWO BRIDES OF THE PAST WEEK
AND A BRIDE-TO-BE, WHO IS
BEING FETED.
That was a pretty conceit of the Haz
ard-Gerlinger wedding on Tuesday, when
the bride was preceded by twenty girl
friends to the chancel rail. While cer
tainly a charming feature, does it not
seem that the groom was entitled, to a
like guard of twenty men?. Really, some

the proper equipment of a wedding,

Dr. Pawllcki served the groom as b*est
man, while the brothers of the bride con
ducted the guests to their seats. Con
spicuous among the guests was Mrs. Joe
Tobin, whoâ always stunningâ wore a
white lace gown and a large white hat.
Few women in San Francisco possess
that rare qualityâ styleâ to a more
marked degree than does Mrs, Joe. Miss
Caroline Russell, daughter of Mrs. de

gown and mink hat. Miss Russell will be

hair and eyes she has!

It is a noteworthy factnhat the bank

figure as a belleâ and a radiant oneâ at
the Confederate ball on Friday night.
What a function that was! Who can
ever forget the beautiful women and
their sumptuous gowning?
Miss Julia dÂ© Laveaga. the affianced
bride of Andrew Welch, whose wedding
takes place on November 11. was the

What a brilllaht bevy of buds we will
have this winter! Unlike ye olden day,
these maidens fair entertain with the
sang froid of their matersâ sometimes bet
ter, and no longer wear the aspect of
downcast eyes and miscalled "modest"
air of "gentle Annies"; they are self
possessed, confident and almost without
exception prove good company. The osten
tatious display of "modesty" that formerly
obtained was largely a physical affecta
tion, while the mind of the maid who
possessed temperamentâ and the ability to
express It legitimately-oftentimes was
cleaner and sweeter and more wholesome,
though not accounted "modest" because
of her frankness and honesty. That kind
of alleged "modesty" is* becoming passe
with the girl who faints at the Eight of
a mouse.
George Downey, was entertained by her
aunt. Mrs. W. H. Cluff, at her home at
a luncheon during the week, which proved
a delightful affair.
Will some one who Is familiar with the
mysterious workings of the human mind
explain why a woman at a church wed
ding so often conducts herself like a small
boy at a circus? Craning of necks, titter
ing, talking aloud and actually Jumping to
her feet In her mad endeavor not to miss
anythingâ and the chances are 10 to 1 she's
"that addle-pated" that when she comes
out she couldn't describe what she saw.
Women should remember that a church,
even if It be a pagoda, or a mosque, or a
JosEhouse, Is sacred to the sentiment of a
peorle and therefore demands our re
rpectful deportment within it- Any other
conduct stamps the offender with 111

Â¦ " i\ battalion of brides and
fi"*^ brides-to-be has never been
* % known before In one season
âand still they come! Mr.
ZlcAdie, the weather man. has attributed
the torridity of the past month to the
exuberance of youthful protestations of
undying affection. Of course, he may be
mistaken; he sometimes Is. But when In
the annals of San Francisco society have
v.e had bo many betrothals and imminent
marriages â dating our calculations since
"pociety" In San Francisco has become a.
jreneric term â as we have had in the last
few moons? It has been asserted that
matrimony breaks out sporadically In
communities, like the measles, and then
l-ecomes epidemic. This diagnosis Eeems
to stand.
It surely seems to be a psychological
principle that when a pair becomes en-
PEged In a social set, their "radiant ec
stasy Is secretly observed by their un
loved and unloving friendsâ and whether
the observation develops a microbe, as in
the measles, or whether there be a dimun
itive mental microbe that does this sort of
â¢workâ the effect upon the friends is just
the same. So are the results. Calls upon
the fair ones soon become regular, and
by the time the "real original" lovers
betake unto themselves each other. )here
jare other souls who. too, long for unity,
sn<l lo! the engagement Is announced,
then the merry wedding. Thus, in logical
sequence, others follow, and bo the merry
mating goes cheerily on. "On." did you
cay. "till whenâ till the divorce court geUi
them?" Well, really, that prognostication
csn hardly be made Â¦with any degree of
success, for the divorce episode depends
almost wholly upon the personality of
principals, suitability in financial and
social position, however, cutting" a large
figure. Generally speaking, the time has
gone, by when men and maids may mate
happilyâ save for the first few weeks or
months â whose education, environment
and financial status are greatly at vari
ance. Matrimony, In Its intimate rela
tlonShip, has a mighty hard time to over
come the disillusionizing that must and.
dees come from all close contact, and any
farther reefs in the course â such as med
dlesome relatives or a giving up of pre
vious comforts and lifelong friendships
is ofttlmes too much for the man at the
wheel, or the woman, as the case might
be, and the bark Is steered for the port
of divorce. But given two people per
fectly mated and, come what may â
mother-in-law or failure -they will steer
thrir little bark outside the Ehoals of
false standards, and journey to the end
together. Thus personality is the quality
that counts and since it is birth, educa
tion and environment that make for per
sonality, let us. hope that the loving
hearts now plighted to each other possess
the personality to weather the storms
that material or spiritual strength seem
powerless to avert. â¢ ;. i-> ;'-*"
