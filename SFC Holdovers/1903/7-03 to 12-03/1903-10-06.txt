DEVONSHIRE'S LETTER.
The Duke of Devonshire's, letter to Bal
four, to which the foregoing was the
response, was communiucated to the press
to-night. It Is as follows:
"My Dear Balfour: I have, since we
last met, felt Increasing- doubt whether I
had been .well advised in consenting to
separate myself from those of our col
leagues whose resignations were tendered
and accepted last month, but until some
new developments should have taken
place I have not thought it necessary to
trouble you with these doubts. The
speech, however, which you delivered last
night made it necessary for me to defi
nitely decide whether I am so near an
agreement with yourself, on the question
of fiscal policy as to make it possible for
me, with . satisfaction to myself or ad
vantage to the community, to remain a
member of your Government
"I must, especially as the representative
of the Government In one of the houses
of Parliament, in forming this decision,
have regard not Only to the different
statements of policy contained In your
speech, but also to Its general tone and
tendency. As to the fqrmer. It was pos
sible to arrive at a clear, understanding
without discussion, but as to the latter

Special Dispatch to The Call,
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 5.â Charles Bock
rath and his wife were arrested to-day on
charges of battery preferred by Philip
Douglas. The arrest disclosed the iden
tity of the parties to a sensational horse
whipping scene on a public street late
Saturday night. The cries of a young
man were heard by the neighborhood and
were mingled with the swish of a horse
whip, but when the curious bestirred
themselves they discovered that the par
ties had driven away and their identity
was not learned.
Douglas had been paying attention to
Miss Eva Harmon, the pretty young step
daughter of Bockrath. Her mother and
Bockrath objected to these attentions and
resolved to put a stop to them.
When found, Douglas was engaged in
conversation with Miss Harmon near the
telephone office, where she is employed.
Alighting from their carriage, Mr. and
Mrs. Bockrath accosted the young couple.
Bockrath seized Douglas' wrists while
Mrs. Bockrath rained terrific blows upon
his face and head with tho butt end of a
horsewhip. When the angry woman felt
that she had punished the young man
sufficiently she gave her daughter a rath
er severe taste of the whip.
Douglas broke and ran, but he had not
gone far when two unknown men as
saulted him with such violence that his
face is a mass of bruises where it does
not show the cuts of the whip.
Eockrath admits the participation of
his wife and himself in the horsewhip
ping episode, saying the measure was
resorted to because Douglas would not
keep his promise to cease his attentions
to Miss Harmon.
van. Scarcely had the call been sent in
when Elliott became violent. The officers
and attendants after a brief but strenu
ous struggle overpowered him. Officer
Ciscle made a cursory examination of his
pockets, but found only a pair of shears
and a large penknife. The man became
quiet, but refused to leave the White
House until he was forced to go. The of
ficers conveyed him to the police van,
which by that time was waiting at the
gate of the White House grounds.
The struggle in the van occurred almost
immediately after Elliott had been placed
in the vehicle. He drew his revolver from
a pocket which seemed to be an enlarged
watch fob. As that Is a most unusual
place in which to carry a pistol, Officer
Ciscle in his hurried search had over
looked the weapon. The pistol was an or
dinary bulldog: five-shorter of a cheap
pattern
SENT TO AN ASYLUM.
At the Emergency Hospital, where his
wounds were dressed, Elliott said he was
sl Swede and that his home was in Min
neapolis. At the St. James Hotel It was
said that Elliott arrived there last
Wednesday evening. He registered as
"P. O. Ell, New York." He had no bag
gage and paid for his room In advance.
He conducted himself about the hotel in a
quiet, gentlemanly manner, and nobody
with whom he came Into contact Imag
ined that he was insane.
Late this afternoon the police surgeong
after a careful examination of Elliott
certified that he was insane. An order
was issued immediately for his removal
to the St.. Elizabeth's Hospital for the
Insane.
Among Elliott's possessions were nu
merous clippings from newspapers
throughout the country, describing an'd
relating incidents In the life of President
Roosevelt, and cards of the Minneapolis
Patent Company of 2S Central avenue,
Minneapolis. In one pocket were manu
scripts written by him in the Swedish
language, with his pictures in different
poses at the head of each. These con
tained lectures on political and religious
subjects.
On one of them was an address to the
American people, written in a rambling
and Incoherent fashion. It was laudatory
of President Roosevelt. The address
spoke of the growing slavery to arid
shameful acts in "grafting" and robbing
by the millionaires and capitalists on
every side. and said that "before it is too
late the President wants to save the
neck of the millionaires in their exist
ence, and their sons and daughters from
the bloody hand of rebellion." Finally
he wants to "crush the trusts in their
childhood." Reference of a pleasant
character is also made to former Presi
dent McKinley.

WOKDS CONVEY A REBUKE.
DUKE BREAKS A PROMISE.
"Do you remember the circumstances?
It was on September 16 that you in
formed me of your resolve to remain In
the Government. This decision was pre
ceded by much confidential correspond
ence, and much intimate conversation.
There was no phase of policy which I was
not prepared to discuss and which, in
fact, 1 did not discuss with perfect frank
ness. Men and measures alike. were sur
veyed from every point of view, bearing
on the present course and future fortunes
of the party.
"The decision arrived at after these
preliminaries I had a right to consider
final, and final I certainly considered it.
Accordingly I consulted you, as far ' as
the circumstances of the time and place
permitted, as to the best methods of fill
ing the vacancies in the Government, of
which you are the most distinguished
member. You were good enough to ex
press some weighty judgments ' on the
delicate matters submitted to you. You
initiated proposals of your own, which I
gladly accepted.
"Our last communication on these sub
jects was in the letter I dictated during
my journey to Sheffield on Thursday
afternoon. Less than forty-eight hours
thereafter 'I received, in Edinburgh,
telegrams which first announced your in
tention to resign and your desire to see
the process of resignation consummated
without delay and without discussion.
STRANGE CHANGE OF FRONT.
"The principal occasion for this sin
gular transformation was, you tell me,
my Sheffield speech. This is strange, in
deed. In intention, at least, there was
no doctrine contained in that speech
which was not contained in my note on
insular free trade and in my published let
ter to Mr. Chamberlain. The first of these
documents you had in your possession
before the generality of the Cabinet. The
second you saw the manuscript of beforo
It appeared in the newspapers. With
both, therefore, you were intimately ac
quainted during the whole fortnight in
which you lent your countenance to the
Government after the recent resignations.
"I must suppose, therefore, , that it is
some discrepancy between the written
and spoken words which now drives you
to forsake the administration. Such.un
intentional discrepancies without doubt
are very hard to avoid. No one, certainly
not I, can always be sure of finding on
the spur of the moment, before an eager
audience of 5000 people, the precise phrase
which shall dexterously express the exact
opinion of the speaker on difficult and
abstract subjects, to foil his opponents,
who would wrest ' It either to the right
hand or to the left hand.
"My Dear Duke: I received, this after
noon, two telegrams forwarded in quick
succession by my private secretary in
Londonâ the first from you, asking how
soon your resignation might be an
nounced, and tho second giving a full
summary of the reasons which moved
you to resign. I am not sure which of
these unexpected communications I sur
prised me most. On the whole, perhaps
it was the second. The llrst, however,
was sufficiently strange. Â¦

reasons for his resignation, which he at

he has had to contend with In the task

hopes of such an administration living
many months, and the prevalent Idea id
that there will be a general election be

The withdrawal of the Duke of Devon
shire is a heavy blow. Had he remained
the Government might have survived an
other Parliamentary session by avoiding
legislation dealing with the fiscal prob
lem, but with him goes the support of the
strong party of Liberal Unionists In the
country. Balfour's extraordinary letter
reproaching the Duke of Devonshire with
breach of faith is the theme of universal
surprise and comment. Though it is gen
erally admitted that it Is difficult to un
derstand why the Duke did not resign
when Ritchie and the others seceded, it
Is recalled that he publicly announced
long ago that he considered it his duty to
hold office as long as possible in the In
terest of free trade, and the curiously
plaintive and bitter tone of Balfour's re
ply is regarded as altogether unjustified
by the circumstances.
LANSDOWNE GAINS POWER.
One consequence of the Duke of Devon
shire's retirement is extremely unfortun
ate for the Government. It will bring the
leadership of the House of Lords to the
unpopular Lord Lansdowne.
No successor has *yet been appointed to
the Duke of Devonshire, and several
minor Government offices still remain
vacant.
Of the few appointments announced to
night the most surprising is that of Hon.
Alfred Lyttelton as Secretary for the Col
onies.. Lyttelton is a man of acknowl
edged ability and a good speaker, but he
has had no ministerial experience what
ever. He Is better known to the colonies
as a cricketer than as a politician. He
and his seven brothers were famous
cricketers at Eton, while Alfred and his
brother Edward displayed even greater
prowess at football, racquets, etc. Al
fred Lyttelton was always an enthusias
tic cricketer and has taken several teams
on colonial tours. He was for ftftoen
yeara the champion tennia player and has
won international football honors. '
Alfred - Lyttelton Is related to Balfouf
by marriage. He has been twice mar
ried. His first wife was a daughter of:
Sir Charles Tennant and his second Is' a
daughter of Archibald Balfour. He la a
cousin of Herbert Gladstone, and his
brother. Sir Neville Lyttelton, is com
mander of the forces in South Africa.
Lyttelton presided over the commission
sent to South Africa to deal with tne
Boer claims, and he also took, a promi
nent part In the Reid Newfoundland ar
bitration.
OTHER APPOINTMENTS WEAK
Although his appointment Is likely to
be keenly criticized, the new Colonial
Secretary Is almost sure of a hearty re
ception In the Ministerial ranks. He 13
credited with being In full sympathy with
Chamberlain's colonial policy and Lord
Mllner's South African ideas, and he is
personally popular.

the Chancellorship of the Exchequer has

were Btandlng just within the vestibule
at the time. Stone told the man that he
could not see the President just at that
moment, as he was engaged, but that he
might possibly arrange to- see him after a
while. - SCSI
At 10 o'clock* this morning he appeared
at the executive offices. Entering the
vestibule, he inquired for President Roose
velt. One of the doorkeepers asked him
why he wanted to. see the President.
"Oh, just for fun," he responded. "The
President sent for me, and I just want to
see him."
Elliott was told to return next month.
He smiled and walked away, not offering
the slightest objection to the rebuff which
he had received. His appearance attract
ed very little attention, and he gave no in
dication at that time of Insanity.
All of the officers, both at the White
House and at the executive offices, how
ever, were warned again to be on the
lookout for the man and not to take any
chances with him. Shortly before 12
o'clock Elliott walked up to the main
door of the White House, stepped inside
and inquired of Officer Ciscle if he might
see the President.
Without slackening his walk, the Presi
dent removed his hat and held out his
hand, saying: "I am glad to meet you,"
and passed on.
ASKS FOB THE PRESIDENT.
"Roosevelt, shake hands with Elliott."
Elliott went to the church early and
during the first part of the services oc
cupied a seat in the gallery overlooking
the pew in which the President sat. He
left the church at the beginning of the
communion cervices and leaned against
the fence of the house Just across from
the church. "When the President emerged
from the church he walked suddenly up
to the President and put out his hand,
eaying:
Several days ago Secretary Loeb re
ceived a letter, postmarked Washington
and written on letter paper of the St.
James Hotel of this city. The letter in
closed a photograph of Elliott and an in
coherent request for an interview with
President Roosevelt. The letter was
signed "Peter Ell," the statement being
made immediately under the signature
that the writer was registered at the hotel
as Peter Elliott. It was evident to Secre
tary Loeb that his correspondent was in
sane and he Issued directions at once that
the officers on duty, both at the White
House and at the executive offices, should
be on their guard against him. The
photograph was turned over to the secret
service officers.
Nothing was seen of the man until yes
terday, when the President attended
morning services at Grace Reformed
Church.
Elliott was overpowered by the officers
on duty at the White House entrance and
carried to a police van which had been
summoned. He was placed In the van in
the custody of two officers. Seeming to
realize then for the first time that he
was under arrest, Elliott began a furious
struggle with his captors. He drew a
revolver and attempted to shoot Officer
James Ciscle. The officer grabbed his
hand and wrenched the weapon from his
grasp. Elliott's struggles were so fierce,
however, that the two officers, in the
cramped quarters of the van, were un
able to overcome him.
Officer Ciscle then drew his revolver
and fired two shots to attract .attention.
Chief Usher Thomas Stone and Officer
Parker of the .White House force, who
had assisted in carrying Elliott to the
van, rushed back to the vehicle and as
sisted in overpowering him.
In the struggle within the police van
Elliott had broken a glass panel with his
head, severely cutting his head and face.
Officer Ciscle sustained a serious cut on
his right arm, two inches .of flesh being
cut out of the fleshy part of it. He
suffered considerably from loss of blood,
but his wound is not serious. The van
was hurried to the Emergency Hospital,
where the injuries of both Ciscle and
Elliott were dressed.

The most ancient specimen of wood
carving known to exist, a statuetteâ it is
of sycamoreâ is In the museum of Glzeh,

very nearly 6000 years old, and still the
wood Is as sound and good as if of re
cent date. It was found' at Sakkarao,
and Is supposed to represent one of the
overseers of the workmen engaged In
building the pyramids which abound In
the Immediate neighborhood and which
compartively recent dlscoveres have
proved to be the oldest of all the pyra
mids of Egypt. The statuette Is known
as the "Skeikd-el-Beled," or "Sheikh of
the Village," a name given to it by the
Arabs who found it, because its features
represented very closely those of the man
who was their own sheikh. In this spec
imen is seen a wonderful Instance of how
human nature, through the roll of thou
sands of years, keeps on repeating itself.
The statuette is distinctly a portrait,
showing a well-fed, closely-shaven man
of 50 or thereabout, altogether nude save
for a cloth bound by *- a leather girdle
about his loins and reaching down to his
knees. He stands erect and In the right

NEW REFORM PROGRAMME.
Foreign Consuls May Act as Council
of Administration.
PARIS, Oct. 5.â It is the expectation in
official quarters hero that the Russian-
Hungarian note to Turkey will soon have
practical results in the creation of the
foreign Consuls In Macedonia and other
disturbed districts as a council of admin
istration to carry out the reformatory
plans of the powers.
The Foreign Office is gratified at the
presentation of the Russo-Hungarian
note, as it fully takes into consideration
the wishes of France and Great Britain.
Therefore the note may be said to be
expressive of the desires not only of
Russia and Austria, but of air the Eu
ropean powers. The organization of a
council of the foreign Consuls Is already
under consideration.
The Turkish Embassador here pub
lished a note received from the Porte
declaring that Bulgaria has falsely rep
resented to the powers the situation in
Macedonia, and that the reports of vil
lages destroyed and of massacres are
untrue.
A Democratic Darkey.
A vear or two before his death Alex
ander Stephens, Vice President of the
former Southern Confederacy, told the fol
lowing to the writer with considerable
glee:
"I had to visit a certain Georgia town,
and before eoing there a friend men
tioned to me that there was an old negro
In the place who had never voted any
thing, but the Democratic ticket since the
right of suffrage was conferred on him.
He made his living carrying trunks to
and from the station. I obtained a de
scription of him and determined to throw
the usual fee to him. A Democratic ne
gro was a rarity down in Georgia then.
A dozen or more rushed up to me, but I
asked for the Democratic darkey. He
came forward smiling. After my arrival
at the hotel I asked if it was true that
he was a Democrat. He t,ald It was. I
then asked him if he knew the differ
ence between the Democratic and Repub
lican parties.
" 'Not came as you does, Bah, but ter
my mln' dar sho'ly am a dlfunce 'twix*
'em.' Being pressed further for Reasons,
he went on: 'Well, you see, sah, I makes
my Hvin* totin' tr. s, an* I ain' been
at de bizness long 'fo' I skivered dat
Democrats in dis neck er de woods, at

fer me to tote. De 'Publicans mor'ly had
nan' satchels which dey toted deyse'f,
an' I come to de 'elusion monst'us quick
dat my intrusts was wld de Democrats.' "
Mr. Stephens thought the statement so
ludicrously logical from 'a business stand
point, and It was such a. lively hit at the
"carpet-baggers" of the Reconstruction
era in the South, that instead of 23 cents
he handed the. darkey a two-dollar bill.â

to the witness chair. Looking him over
carefully the Coroner asked: "What's

The Conservative organs admit that
there was nothing In the Duke's conduct
to JuBtify such ah outburst, and they ex

Liberal papers believe that after the reve
lations of Balfour's conduct toward
Ritchie and Lord George Hamilton re
garding the concealment *of ghamberlaJh's
resignation, there is still hidden much of
the history of the Duke of Devonshire's
action, and they, point out that, having
sacrificed Chamberlain with the special
object of securing the Duke, the Premier
now finds himself deserted.
The Conservative Standard voices the
party regret that within six months a
great party and a strong Government
have gone to pieces, leaving only chaos,
and it expresses surprise that Balfour
hag the Idea of facing Parliament with
his Cabinet so grievously weakened.
Only one opinion is expressed in the edi
torials this morning on Balfour's letter,
namely, that it is a manifestation of his
dismay and disappointment at the loss of

With regard to the standard of weight
for growing children, that usually given
by authorities in the matter is that at 5
years of age a child should weigh about
as many pounds a3 it is inches high. As
a rule this will not be" much over or under
forty pounds. Children who come of largÂ»
families should weigh something more
than that. The rate of Increase should be
about two pounds for every inch of
growth, with a tendency for the weight to
exceed thl9 standard proportionately
rather than to fall below It. When a child
is rather heavier in proportion to its
height than this standard it is a sign of
good health. If the child is growing rap
idly, it should not be allowed to fall much
below it without being made to rest more
than has been the custom before. A defi
ciency of weight in proportion to height is
always an unfavorable sign. Any Inter
ruption in the progress of increase of
weight, especially during the continuance
of growth, must be a danger signal that
should not be neglected by those Interest

John J. Barrett represented the Chinese
Consul General in the matter and pro

that the policeman first insulted Colonel
Tom and then felled him to the sidewalk
with a blow in the face. The witnesses
swore to the same story without varia

Pung, Foong Sun, Owyang King of the
Chinese Consulate, Dong Gong and others
who professed to have been eyewitnesses
of the affair. Their testimony was to the
effect that on the day preceding the sui

Coroner Leland, in view of the serious
aspect of the testimony against the
patrolman, continued the inquest until
Friday, at 10 a. m., In order to enable
Officer Kreamer to produce his -witnesses.
The question was asked of several of
the witnesses whether it was the custom
in China for innocent men accused of
crime to commit suicide. They replied
that It. is the custom when a man of
noble character is falsely accused, where
it is difficult for him to obtain Justice or
a vindication, to commit suicide to prove
his innocence.
He was met by Policeman Kreamer in
full uniform, who took hold of him rudely
and made an Improper remark in pigeon
English. The Colonel shook off the po
liceman's grasp with an angry gesture,
whereupon Kreamer struck him a severe
blow in the face, knocking: him orone on
the sidewalk. Then Kreamer, placing two
fingers in his own mouth, whistled for
another policeman, who was near by.
The Chinese witnesses nearest the scene
called upon Colonel Tom to get away
from the officer and escape into the Con

so, but could not break away from his

SESOS' BITTER LETTER TO DUKE
"In Japan's viewpoint the commercial
point of the whole situation Is Korea.
Russia knows that we will fight to the
death rather than let any foreign power
occupy Korea. Russia's timber conces
sions there and the other recent initiative
she has exhibited in Korea render the
present negotiations extremely difficult,
but the horizon shows no cloud so dark
aa to threaten war. Great Britain, as our
ally, Is naturally cognizant of the trend
of our present negotiations, all of which
look toward peace. We have no reason
to believe that Russia's activity in se
curing dockyards for her Far Eastern
fleet is actuated by an Intention to pre
pare for hostilities any more than our.
own necessary provisions for the best
equipment for the convenience of our
army and navy." -^
Â© â¢i"i"i-i"i"i-:"i"i"i-i"i"i--i"i"i"i"i"i"i"i-i"i-o
The Japanese embassy in London has
given out the following statement of the
prevailing conditions:
"We are forced to believe that it is
physically Impossible for Russia to fulfill
her promise to evacuate Manchuria by
October 8, but we do not anticipate a
crisis on that account. It would be a
case of making the lesser include the
greater were we to break the negotiations
now In progress at Tokio because of Rus
sia's failure to keep her promise on the
exact date. So far as known here no
naval or military preparations have been
undertaken by Japan to meet any expect
ed emergency. We have hopes that a final
settlement may be reached between Rus
sia and ourselves that will settle once for
all our outstanding disputes.
WOULD FIGHT FOB KOREA.
No treaty however, has yet been signed
and it is unlikely that the negotiations
will be concluded by October 8, the date
on which Russia was to evacuate Man
churia. Russia's failure to evacuate
Manchuria on that day. however, will not
precipitate a diplomatic crisis, as Japan,
rather than break off the negotiations
covering broadly all the Issues between
herself and Russia, is willing to strain a
point regarding Manchuria in the hope of
arriving at a satisfactory settlement. In
all of this the British Government ac
quiesces.
Such features of Immediate danger as
the Far Eastern situation at present ap
pear to be confined solely to the popular
agitation in Japan against Russia after
October 8. This, however, Is being taken
into consideration by the Japanese Gov
ernment, whose diplomats have warned
Russia that while the Japanese Govern
ment will not allow its hand to be forced
to the extent of entering into hostilities
over the Manchurian evacuation question,
it cannot Indefinitely prolong the present
negotiations at Tokio in face of the ex
pected popular clamor..
JAPAN YIELDS A POINT.
LONDON, Oct. 5.â No apprehension ex
ists in the minds of British Government
officials or the diplomatists in London
that the Far Eastern situation will bring
forth any immediate aerious develop
ments. This feeling of temporary secur
ity on the eve of the day that Russia
should, but admittedly will not, evacuate
Manchuria, Is due to assurances on the
part of Japan that so long as the negoti
ations now^proceeding between herself
and Russia "present a reasonable prospect
that a settlement will be reached Japan
will take no action hostile to Russia in
the matter of Manchuria. It is learned
further, that tnese negotiations, looking
to a final settlement of the Russo-Japan
ese sphere of influence In the Far East
and especially dealing with the situation
in Korea, are progressing satisfactorily
at Toklo.
PARIS, Oct. 5.â The Russian Govern
ment has made It known that Japanese
mobilization of troops for transportation
to Korea does not, up to to-day, consti
tute an unfriendly act against Russia.
At tha same time the Russian Govern
ment is being kept fully advised as to the
extent and nature ot Japan's military and
naval mobilization. It appears from these
official sources that Japan *hus far has
embarked three divisions of troops' and
the Japanese fleet is now between Chem
ulpo and Fusan. The ships continue un
der steam, but nothing is known beyond
this concerning their purposes. ,, 'â¢; i
It is paid that the Catholic Archbishop
of Phllippopolis has sent the Pope a long
account of the situation in the vilayet of
Adrlanople and has begged his Holiness
to intercede to prevent the continuance
of the massacres and atrocities. The
refugees at the Rila monastery are now
said to total 5000. . rV
The frontier authorities on the Phlllp
popolis frontier announce that the
Turkish forces have retired from their
pests, to a distance of several kilometers
Inward. This step is regarded as a ruse
to allow the crossing of the bands, in
order to throw the responsibility for
subsequent occurrences in Macedonia
upon Bulgaria.
Between the election and the war prepa
rations, the Ministry is confronted by an
awkward constitutional predicament. The
time of a large p.ortion of the reserves
called to the colors should expire three
days before the election, but the consti
tution provides that all temporary ser
vice men should be released five days
before the election. It appears that the
Government must either discharge the
men and leave the country exposed to the
danger of a sudden Turkish invasion, or
risk a state trial and a conviction, which
would mean long terms of imprisonment.
Such a contingency cannot be lightly re
garded In a country -where party strife
Is so bitter as in Bulgaria. Apparently
the Government's only salvation lies In a
political victory, after which the Sobranje
could set aside any convictions.
According to a dispatch from the Rlla
monastery, a large party of fugitives
from Razlog and Godlevo, while crossing
the frontier on Sunday morning, was con
tinuously fired upon by" the post at
Aiguedik. The Turks followed the fugi
tives into Bulgarian territory and killed
two of them.
An Identical copy of the Austro-Russian
note to Turkey has been presented to
Premier Petroff and the Austrian and
Russian representatives received instruc
tions at the same time to make serious
representations to the Bulgarian Govern
ment to the effect that the powers ex
pect Bulgaria to take such action as will
prove that she is making- a loyal en
deavor to assist the work of pacification.
Falling this Bulgaria was warned that
she will be exposed to the most cruel dis
aster. This letter cf warning Is "held to
mean a Turkish invasion of Bulgaria and
a repetition of the Macedonia atrocities
in Bulgaria itself. The foregoing, com
bined with the continued reports of small
frontier conflicts, haa renewed the war
rumors and induced the feeling that the
situation is precarious.
Dr. Tartajcheff, the president of the
Macedonian committee, says he does not
regard the new note more seriously than
the former or.es. He declares that any
By8texn of European control is useless,
unless it has the power to enforce the re
forms, entirely independent of the Porte.
SOFIA, Oct. 5. â The Austro-Russian
note to the - Porte, published yesterday,
has been received somewhat skeptically
in official circles here, and, among the
Macedonian organizations, with utter
disbelief that any good can come from it.
One point on which all parties
are agreed is that action la the
only satisfactory pledge of reform
that the Ottoman Government can
give. The Bulgarian Government Is
anxious to see> the promised details of
the new measures, but it is argued that
if they are too stringent Turkey may pre
fer war to accepting them, while If they
are not stringent enough they certainly
will be useless. \

The adherents of William S. Devery
held a convention to-night and formally
nominated him for Mayor. â¢
At the convention "of the Independent
Populist party, held to-night William S.
Devery was nominated for Mayor.
Fornes broke silence to-day by issuing
a statement that he,, like Grout, had con
sulted with the Mayor relative to his ac
ceptance of a Democratic nomination to
which he says, the Mayor appeared to per
ceive no objection. Fornes also said that
he would not retire from either ticket,
although he- would take no legal action
to compel his retention on that of the
fusionists.
NEW YORK, Oct. 6.â The only decisive

the course of the Citizens 1 Union and Re

organization now stood on a purely party
basis and pledging its support to the
Democratic ticket headed by McClellan,
Grout and Fornea.
The Citizens' Union adjourned until to
morrow without coming to any decision
regarding the fusion candidates for
Comptroller and Aldermanic President.
It Is now ," definitely settled that, what
ever action the fuslonists may take,
Grout and Fornes will remain on the

BISSEIX'S CONDITION
SAID TO BE CBITICAL
A reign of tenor exists everywhere at
Ciudad Bolivar, and consequently trade
Is paralyzed.
President Castro's representative at
Ciudad Bolivar was reported as saying:
"Germany and the other foreign pow
ers obliged the Venezuelan Government to
pay millions. Now it is Venezuela who
forces the Germans and other foreigners
to reimburse her."
PORT OF SPAIN, Island of Trinidad,
Oct. 5.â Emissaries of President Castro of
Venezuela have arrived at Ciudad Boli
var, Venezuela, with orders to collect
forcibly not only the taxes, but custom
house duties already paid by Importers
from May, 1902, to August 1, 1903, the
period during which the revolution
ists occupied that city as Government de
facto. The amount demanded is about
$1,000,000.
The foreigners, especially the firms of
Blohm & Co.. German; Palazzl & Co.,
French; Boccardo & Co., Italian, and Dal
ton & Co., American, have refused to
pay, claiming the duties had been already
legally paid.
Menaces and vexatious tactics are em
ployed against the foreigners. Heir
Sprlck, a German, refused to pay back
duties, and a cargo of rum belonging to
him, which was being landed from a
steamer, was seized by the Government
and sold at public auction for almost
nothing. The German merchants in this
manner lost 525,000. Venezuelan mer
chants who refuse to pay, having no pro
tection, are Imprisoned.

PASO ROBLES, Oct. 5.â Each train
to-day brought its contingent to

Lions, Monkeys and Parrots Give
Many Proofs of the
Tendency.
Professor Cesare Lombroso, the Italian
scientist skilled In detecting traces of ab
normality, explains In the North Ameri
can Review the Imperfections of the left
handed.
People who are' more agile with the
left than with the right hand are most
numerous among "women, children, sav
ages and criminals." The percentages Is
about 4 per cent among men (operatives
and soldiers), 5 to S per cent among wo
men and about the same among lunatics.
But among criminals Professor Marro
found 13 per cent of the men and 22 per
cent of the women left-handed. Swindlers
offered a greater percentageâ no less than
33â and murderers and ravishers only
from 9 to 10 per cent.
Professor Lombroso also discusses the
far more complex subject of "left-sided
ness." Certain people are more sensitive
upon the left side than upon the right.
This condition has no connection with
left-handedness, and Is highest In lunatics
â44 per cent. V
Parrots are left-handed and so are lions.
Rollet found in twenty- seven monkeys
the left shoulder heavier than the right
Women, children and primitive races
make gestures and simple movements
from right to left. This is why women
button their garments In a different direc
tion from men, and why early languages,
like the Arabic, are written from right to
left. Very old chronometers were wound
from right to left, not from left to right,
as at present.
However, Professor Lombroso hedges
by saying: "One- can without difficulty
find among good 1 * men real left-hancled
ness, as among the great evil-doers there
are some who have not that characteris
tic. I do not dream at all of saying that
all left-handed people are wicked, but
what left-handedness, united to -many
other traits, may contribute to form one
of the worst characters among the human
species."â Baltimore Herald.
There are occasional signs of anxiety
for fear that John D. Rockefeller will get
all the money there is, says Harper's
Weekly. Mr. Rockefeller has not lately
seen fit to publish his estimate of the
value of his posessions, but sanguine
guessers rate him nowadays as pretty
nearly a billionaire, and the most conser
vative computers believe he has more
than half a billion. It would be impos
sible to say what is the total wealth of
the United States, but the assessed valua
tion of the several States for 1902 amount
ed to about thirty-five billions. Even if
Mr.' Rockefeller has a whole billion, there
is something left for the rest of us. But
his fortune, they tell us, is probably in
creasing by as much as fifty millions a
year, and is not unlikely to double within
ten years. Already his financial power is
enormous, so that he could influence stock
values very materially if he chose, and,
at times, make or unmake ordinary mil
lionaires by mere whispers at the tele
phone.
. Malevolence Is not attributed to him,
nor is he felt to be a mischief maker, but
the feeling is that his business abilities
are so surpassing and his business Judg
ment so unapproachably sound that he
can't help seeing and Improving chances
to make millions more. To. discuss him Is
as little' of an impertinence as to discuss
the comet. He is a force. 64 years old,
moving through the earth's atmosphere,
and believed to be rapidly increasing in
weight and velocity. Persons who fear
they are in his orbit and may be pinched
may -find some relief, in considering that
even though :his. fortune increases very
rapidly 'its growth may long be fed by the
increase of wealth in the. country.

notwithstanding it three times exceeded
the limit. City Attorney Brown had given
it as his opinion that as It was an emer

Mayor Worswick, however, to-day re
fused to sanction it. He claimed that
Byron could not be a contractor, as it was
an illegal contract. He said Byron was
entitled to $31 50 for material furnished
and superintending the work, and the em
ployes who worked on the chimneys were
each entitled to their pay, but that the
bills must be separate.

Tyner had been connected with the
postal service In many Important capaci
ties for many years. He was Postmaster
General from July 12, 1S76, to March 12,
1877, and subsequently held the offices of
First Assistant Postmaster General and
Assistant Attorney General, from which
office he was dismissed by Postmaster
General Payne last spring, following Mrs.
Tyner's abstraction of papers from the
safe. Tyner is nearly 80 years old and is
in grave physical condition from paraly
sis. Barret is a nephew of Tyner and
was appointed from North Carolina. He
was Assistant Attorney General until De
cember 31, 1900, when he resigned to take
up his law practice.
Metcalf has been in the postal service
since February, 1SS2, and was superin
tendent of the money order system from
September, 18S7, until his recent summary
dismissal. He was appointed from Iowa,
The gathering of evidence in Barret's
case proved more difficult than In any
other postal case. This is attributed by
the postoffice authorities to Barret's legal
knowledge, his familiarity with depart
mental matters and more especially to
the plea of administrative discretion
which he set up in defense of his acts.
Attention was called to-day by the au
thorities to an opinion which Barret ren
dered as acting Assistant Attorney Gen
eral regarding the use of the mails in so
called bond Investment schemes. In that
decision. Barret said that while certain
of the plans of the operation then before
him were In some instances against the
postal laws, he was thoroughly convinced
that the base underlying the bond invest
ment proposition was sound, and suggested
the elimination of several features of the
schemes in order to remove objections.
This decision was Issued In circular form
on December 5, 1900, and at the close of
that month Barret entered upon his pri
vate practice, in which he is alleged to
have represented bond investment compa

secured in the investigation had now been

on and approximately thirty different per
sons indicted as the result of the probing
that has been in progress since last

Congress, but that many reforms had
been made from time to time as the in

BIG COMPANIES

The charge against. Hallenbeck and the
Metcalfs is that of conspiracy to defraud
the United States. The company of which
Hallenbeck Is at the head had a contract
with the United States to furnish the
postal service with its money order
blanks. The new charge against Machen
Is that of accepting a bribe in connection
with the delivery of badges worn by
rural free delivery carriers, which were
made by Charles J. Heller of Philadel
phia. There are two new indictments
against Beavers, one of them charging
him with accepting $25 each on a number
of books sold to the Government by Scott
Towers and others, alleging misconduct
In the purchase of stamp canceling ma
chines from W. D. Doremus. Towers is
also indicted in connection with Beavers
on the charge of agreeing to pay Beavers
$25 on each machine. Doremus is indicted
for defrauding the Government in the sale
of his canceling machines.
PLEASED WITH JURY'S WORK
Postmaster General Payne expressed
great satisfaction to-day at the conclusion
of the postofflce Investigation, culminat
ing In to-day's Indictments. He said that
he expected to have the report of Brls
tow in his hands within ten days, and
that Jt would undoubtedly soon.be given
to the President. The report will consist
of about 350 typewritten pages of approxi
mately 300 words each. The next steps
now, he said, were the trial of August
W. Machen, former head of the free de
livery system, which Is to be in this city;
the trial of Daniel Miller, formerly law
clerk In the Postofflce Department,- and
of Attorney Johns, who was indicted with
Miller, that trial taking place in Cincin
nati. The case of George A. C. Chris
tiancy, who was acting as Assistant At
torney General of the Postofflce Depart
ment during Tyner's prolonged absence. 1
and who was given an indefinite leavfe of
absence as a result of permitting Mrs.
Tyner: to remove papers from the safe in
his office, will be disposed "of soon. His
resignation has been In the hands of the
Postmaster General for months, but ac
tion on it was deferred until the conclu
sion of the Investigation. Payne will call
upon Assistant Attorney General Roberts
for a report and it will be decided then
whether Christlancy's resignation will be
accepted. â¢
Payne said to-day that all the evidence
The principal charge against Tyner and
Barret is misconduct In office, in ob
structing and preventing the due and or
derly administration of the law. It is
stated that there were no less than eighty
of the so-called bond investment com
panies to which the opinion of the depart
ment was sent, together with the circular
Intimating that Barret's services as at
torney could be secured.
CHARGE AGAINST MACHEN.
It is charged that Barret had entered Into
an agreement with J. H. Nelson of the Bal
timore bar for a partnership In law, the ob
ject being to share in the profits which might
arise from representing bond investment com
panies before the Postofflce Department; that
In pursuance of a conspiracy with Tyner. Bar
ret investigated the schemes of the concerns
and wrote and signed the report; that this
report declared the business in Its existing
form to be illegal and not entitled to the use
of the mails, but that Its base was sound
and that it could be made over so as to be
lesal.
It is chaired that this opinion was sent
to every known company, with a circular let
ter to each stating that the business of that
company was Illegal; that at about the same
time, December, 1900, Barret sent to each
company an announcement that he had re
signed his. position and entered into a partner
ship for the practice of law at Baltimore and
Washington. The purpose of the conspiracy
is alleged to be the sending of business to
Barret's firm, and the opinion gave no in
structions as to the proper way of making
over the contracts, but showed that Barret
knew how it was to bo done. In pursuance
of this conspiracy it is alleged that Tyner and
Barret refused to consider or approve new
contracts submitted prior to, the time Barret
retired, except for the one or two concerns
that had already retained his services.
The indictments cite special cases in which
Barret, while Ptlll in office, sought or received
fees, or in which, after Barret retired, Tyner
referred clients to Â¦ him and approved new
contracts at his suggestion without even read
ing them over.
ILLEGAL USE OF THE MAILS.
Concerning the indictments against Ty
ner and Barret a statement was made
by the Postofflce Department, which is
in part as follows:
Three Indictments charge Tyner and Bar
ret with conspiracy and two additional In
dictments charge Barret with agreeing, while

founded upon the treatment by Tyner and
Barret of the business of the so-called bond in
vestment companies.
It was the duty of Tyner and Barret to In
vestigate the methods of concerns charged
with Improper use of the malls and in case of
guilt to report to the Postmaster General. In
this connection they investigated the busi
ness of the bor.d investment companies and
learned that they wire all carrying on a busi
ness that involved fraud or lottery, or both;
but instead of recommending to the Postmas
ter General the issue of an order that would
prevent the delivery of mall or the payment
of money orders to these concerns they con
nplred to tive, them unobstructed use of the
malls in order that Barret might profit
thereby.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 5.â Fifteen new in
dictments were brought into the Supreme
Court for the District of Columbia to
day as the final result of the investigation
in the Postofflce Department. Several of
these findings were against persons who
have already "been Indicted. The Indict
ments involve James N. Tyner, the late
Assistant Attorney General for the Post
office Department, and his assistant, Har
rison J. Barret; James T. Metcalf, super
intendent of the money order system, of
the Postoflice Department; Normal Met
calf, son of James T. Metcalf; Harry C.
Hallenbeck,' president and general man

Crawford Company of New York, the firm
which for several years supplied the de
partment with its money order blanks,
and William D. Doremus, who is con

supplying the stamp canceling machines.
There were additional indictments against
August Machen, former superintendent of
free delivery; George Beavers, formerly
chief of the salary and allowance de
partment; W. Scott Towers, who was in
charge of a eub-statlon of the Washing

A. Green of New York. In some cases
there were several indictments against
one person.

ANDâ OTHERS.
The better class of druggists, everywhere, are men of scientific attainments and high integrity,
who devoto their lives to the welfare of their fellow men in supplyiDg the best of remedies and
purest medicinal agents of known value, in accordance with physicians' prescriptions and
scientific formula. Druggists of the better class manufacture many excellent remedies, but
always under original or officinal names and they never sell false brands, or imitation medicines.
They are the men to deal with when in need of anything in their line, which usually includes
all standard remedies and corresponding adjuncts of a first-class pharmacy and the finest and
best of toilet articles and preparations and many useful accessories and remedial appliances.
The earning of a fair living, with the satisfaction which arises from a knowledge of the benefits
conferred upon their patrons and assistance to the medical profession, is usually their greatest
reward for long years of study and many hours of daily toil. They all know that Syrup of
Figs is an excellent laxative remedy and that it gives universal satisfaction, and therefore they
are selling many millions of bottles annually to the well informed purchasers of the choicest
remedies, and they always take pleasure in handing out the genuine article bearing the full
name of the Company â California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package.
They know that in case3 of colds and headaches attended by biliousness and constipation and
of weakness or torpidity of the liver and bowels, arising from irregular habit3, indigestion, or
over-eating, that there is no other remedy so pleasant, prompt and beneficial in its effects as
Syrup of Figs, and they are glad to sell it because it gives universal satisfaction.
Owing to the excellence of Syrup of Figs, the universal satisfaction which it gives and the
immense demand for it, imitations have been made, tried and condemned, but there are
individual druggists to be found, here and there, who do not maintain the dignity and principles
of the profession and whose greed gets the better of their judgment, and who do not hesitate
to recommend and try to sell the imitations in order to make a larger profit. Such preparations
sometimes have the name â u Syrup of Figs" â or "Fig Syrup" and of some piratical concern,
or fictitious fig syrup company, printed on the package, but they never have the full name of
the Companyâ California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of the package. The imitations
should be rejected because they are injurious to the system. In order to sell the imitations
they find it necessary to resort to misrepresentation or deception, and whenever a dealer passes
off on a customer a preparation under the name of "Syrup of Figs" or "Fig Syrup," which
does not bear the full name of the California Fig Syrup Co. printed on the front of the package,
he is attempting to deceive and mislead the patron who has been so unfortunate a3 to enter his
establishment, whether it be large or small, for if the dealer resorts to misrepresentation and
and, deception in one case he will do so with other medicinal agents, and in the filling of
physicians' prescriptions, and should be avoided by every one who values health and happiness.
Knowing that the great majority of druggists are reliable, we supply the immense demand
for our excellent remedy entirely through the druggists, of whom it may be purchased every-
where, in original packages only, at the regular price^ of fifty cents per bottle, but as exceptions
exist it is necessary to inform the public of the facts, in order that all may decline or return
any imitation which may be sold to them. If it does not bear the full name of the Company â
California Fig Syrup Co. â printed on the front of every package, do not hesitate to return the
article and to demand the return of your money, and in future go to one of the better class ot
druggists who will sell you what you wish and the best of everything in his line at reasonable prices.

It is a very significant fact that when my

to win tho fight. (Laughter.) But the situa
tion is not one to be picked up in a Joking

business men, wholesale men, retail men, men
from every part of the city at a municipal elec

Frank H. Powers was called to the plat
form and was loudly cheered. Mr. Powers
delivered a forcible speech and entertain

of the subjects he discussed. In part, he
spoke as follows:

The meeting was opened by Congress
man Julius Kahn. He was given some
hearty cheers when he stepped forward
to address the big assemblage and when
quiet was restored he epoke as follows:
Ladies and Gentlemen : I see that tha good
I*ople of San Francisco have lost none of
thÂ»ir enthusiasm. I don't know how to suf
ficiently thank them en behalf of Mr. Crocker
for their kind outpouring to-night, and this
fiiyt beginning in this campaign shows that we
â¢w-ill carry en a political fight that will termi
nate In absolute victor}"- (Applause.) The
city of Â£an Francisco has entered upon a mag
nificent era. The people of this city within a
week have voted to materially improve our
beautiful city. (Applause).
It has been my good fortune to visit many
rarts of this globe, but I am free to say that
never In my Ufa have I vicited any place that
has appealed to me as has this glorious city.
And when San Francisco fhall have seen the
improvements for which you have voted she
will lr.fieed become the most magnificent city
upon the face of God's green footstool.
The people of thia elty are inter

The candidate that will appear before you a
little later this evening. Mr. Henry J. Crocker,
is a. representative man in every sense of the 1
Â¦word. (Applause).
During this campaign we will have many
meetings. His entire career will be presented
to you. He lias **>own his splendid public
Fpirtt In taaur efforts for the good people of
this State and of this city. I don't propose at
this time to dwell uixm them at length because
there is to be a great ratification meeting of
the Republican party on Saturday evening
next at the Alhambra Theater, and there you
will be told ail about Mr. Crocker and his fel
low candidate* on the Republican ticket.
But thU tneetlnr to-night is called by the
business men of San Francisco, and by that.
as I have been given to understand, is not
meant alone the men in the wholesale part of
thÂ« city, but the men In tha retail part of this
city, who have interests afst&ke Just as other
men ' In Fan Francisco.
They are taking an interest in this fight
and they are going to fleet Mr. Crocker on
JCorember 3. < Applause.) It is simply my
j l-.-isurt- this evening to call this meeting to
order. Tbe purpose of the meeting is to or
ganize the Henry J. Crocker Club, and I am
ready to receive nominations for chairman.
Julian Sonntag arose and said he had
the honor and pleasure to name Charles
Laumeister. Before the . nominations
could close. C. B. Rode was recognized by
the temporary chairman. He said he did
not believe in haste. He said he knew
Charles Laumeister for many years and
was his friend, but he thought there were
other candidates. He therefore nominated
Honorable Julius Kahn. Mr. Kahn smil
ingly declined the honor and Mr. Lau
meister was elected. The chairman was
escorted to the platform by Messrs.
Sonntajr and Rode. Mr. Laumeister was
Kiven a hearty reception. He called for
nominations for secretary and C. B. Per
kins nominated Robert S. Aitken. There
â¢was no Deposition and Mr. Aitken was
elected. Bdgar Peixotto nominated Mar
shall Hale and Llppman Sachs as first
and second vice presidents of the club
and they were elected.
The following telegram received from
Governor Pardee was read by thÂ© secre
tary and loudly cheered:

His statements were sensational and
created a furor among bis auditors, He
spoke as follows:

Julian Sonntag was the next speaker in
troduced by. Chairman Laumeister. Mr.
Sonntag at the outset of his address said
he had known Mr. Crocker for many
years and was qualified to speak about
him as a man. In part he said:
" "All that you have got to do is to follow
the progress of Henry J. Crocker from the

Mayor and Mr. Casey clof They

and walked out of the room, What
would Henry J. Crocker have done
or Raid hod I said that to him? It
is a b ii sin ess man that we want.
CApplaase.) We want more busi
ness men In this City Hall.
Shortly after tbat I took a trip through the
north at my own expense. I was surprised
how far behind the times we are In our busi
ness affair?. But that is a thing of the past
We know it is a difficult matter to bring the
business men to a political meeting, and this
Is a erf at one, and it shows in -this matter
this is only the beginning; but I, want to say
this:
There was a howl. (A voice: "Who made
the howl â Casey?") (Laughter.) But tho
system was inaugurated there, and while we
Ehould have had at least four or five bids from
business people they were complaining that all
this patronage was going into one channel. I
assure you, gentlemen, I had an up and down
fight all the time I was there. It was because
my constituents were business people. I went
to the present Mayor and complained .to him
and he said: "You are doing well, Van; keep
it of>. Go to it. Tou are one of the few
Commissioners who is a credit to my adminis
tration." (Laughter).
Then a few davs before the reappolntment or
the new Commissioners the present Mayor said
that he was going to reappoint me and news
paper men came down to my office and con
gratulated me. A few hours before a gentle
man lold me that I was on the toboggan.
(Laughter.) I went to the Mayor and I Bpoke
to him and asked him if It was so. "Well,
Van. -I don't know, but I will gee you later,"
he answered. (Laughter.) I demanded an ex
planation and asked him if be did not say that
I was doing right. "Didn't I bring up a box
of bills and show you that the city was being
charged exorbitant prices?" 1 I showed him
that the city was being charged twice as much
for putting on a leg of a wheelbarrow as was
needed to buy a new barrow. He called up thÂ»
Honorable Michael Casey. (Laughter.) Ha
said: "Now, Mr. Casey, what is it you have
against Van? I think he is doing all right."
"Well, It don't make any difference." said
Casey. (The speaker imitated Casey's man
ner of speaking end his auditors laughed hear
tily.) He says: "I don't loike ther mon;
whin I don't lolke ther mon I don't want him
around." (Laughter.) I eald: "Ib that all?"
"No, sir," he says; "I told yer whin yer foist
came in here the newspapers were hostile to
us. One of the first things ye did was to call
the newspapers into your office and ask what
they wanted."
I did. 1 called the- newspaper men, as I
thought it was customary to let them know
what was going on In public affairs. I asked
them .what they wanted to know and they
told me the public had a right to know what
was gclng on in a .nubile way and it was my
fluty to tell them in order that the public
might learn what was going on. I said to the
members of the press, "Gentlemen, you shall
know," and they did. And anything that was
going on In the public meetings I gave to
them. And that is what Mr. Casey objected to.
1 then requested of the Mayor, in the pres
ence of Mr. Casey, that I be allowed to write
out my resignation, and that it take effect
thirty days later â on the 8th day of February.
PITIES THE IO.YOB.
CORNER ON PATRONAGE.
It Is due a crrrnt deal to the lack
of business methods that makes it
farce of the Hoard of Public Works
to-day. I could tell you many in
stances and different things that
have oecurred there. Some of them
would make yon laugh and some of
them would make you sick. (AiÂ»Â«
plause.)
I first found that the business man was
greatly abused. Under the charter you can
purchase, anything bo long as it is below the
amount of $500 without any bid*. It made
no difference whether the city wanted to buy
a bale of hay. a pair of rubber boot* or a keg
of nai!s, it seemed to go to one party. When I
saw that this patronage was unfairly distrib
uted 1 undertook to remedy the evil In order
to save the city from paying exorbitant prices.
One of Che grreatent plank* I be
lieve ihv-t the Republican party has
lnnerteJ ft it* platform in that to
purify i'je Hoard of Public Works.
< Applaune.) It la the most important
commlMHion of all the coiiimiKwioiiN
in Sun Francisco. Upon that com
iuiv<ioii certainly a ffrent deal de
pends for the nnccess of our good
nnd better San Francisco. (Ap
plaune.)
I only wish you all could havo had the ex
perience that I have had while I was there.
It was 8.i unsolicited honor. It was a great
surprise to me. The duties I knew would be
new, but I went in there as a Republican with
a firm determination to do that which was
right and to protect the many taxpayers. I
knew that In protecting their interests I would
be protecting my own.
short, but I assure you it was hot whils I was
in there. (Laughter).
The charges against the other promoters
are, in brief, that they knowingly ac
cepted \ $41,000,000 in bonds and stock for
properties and plants not worth $10,000,000,
and that- the same was effected through
false statements concerning the proper
ties and their respective values. '
he sold to the ship-building company, the
Bethlehem Steel Company,, taking in pay
ment JIO.OOO.OOO in bonds, $10,000,000 of pre
ferred stock and $10,000,000 of the common
stock of tho defendant ship-building com
pany, "well knowing that in truth said

Company, was not worth, at most," $10,

man of this city, was introduced, and
when the applause had ceased he spoke,
in part, as follows:
I am not a professional lawyer accustomed
to speaking and cannot interettt you as has
my predecessor. I have not had the experi
ence in tne party ranks and cannot interest
you, but, as a uuslneos man, who has grown
up In San Francisco, who feels an interest in
the advancement cf her affairs, I feel that it
Is a duty to each of us to bear a hand In im
proving the conditions of this city, in placing
its management in such hands as will control
the expenditure of our money In a way that
we will get the full benefit of it.
In times past San - Francisco has had its ex
perience with all kinds of government and

thnt will cost you $35,000,000. Yon

newer that will stand' the teat.-'
This is â¢ not a talk to 'run down * Mayor
Bchmltz. He Is a lovely man. A good man.
He la a neighbor of mine and is a very good
musician. .His fault is . trying to be a good
politician. We don't want a good politician.
We want a good Mayor. We want some real
business enthusiasm in this campaign. Not
the enthusiasm that hollers on the corner and
paints red signs on other people's fences
(laughter), but the enthusiasm tbat comes to
the lunch table and talks over what is best
for the community we have here.
This campaign is going to recolvo itself into
a fiKht for Schmitz and the strongest candi
date on the other side. South of .Market
street to-day is behind Schmitz almost to a
finish ; but Joe Tobin only got 11,000 votes.
Franklin K. Lane is going to get more than
11, C 0. Schmitz is not going to get as many
as he got before, but it lies with you busi
ness men to say whether the Republican party
is KOing to stay true to itself and get behind
Henry J. Crocker, (Applause.)
The last week t>f the campaign they will
go down the etreet and say that Franklin K.
Lane has the whole south of Market street
behind him. Are you going to be stampeded?
(Cries of "No, No.") Show them that the
Republican party to a man is behind a busi
ness man on some of these commissions. Are
you going to tight for some of the principles
you fought for In the Presidential campaign
and which one year from now we have to get
behind and elect Theodore Roosevelt? Â¦ You
want to get away from your "isms." Get
down to earth. Get behind a business man;
don't gret behind Ttuef'Â» man; don't get behind
McNab's man; get behind a man who knows
himself â Henry J. Crocker. (Great applause.)

All they had to do was to call upon Henry
J. Crocker and he was always ready. He was
never found wantine. In the Forty-first Dis
trict In this city he has erected one of the
most beautiful homes in our city.
Henry J. Crocker did not speak at great
length, but what he did say was to the
point. Before going to Union Square Hall,
he addressed a large meeting of his fel
low citizens at Richmond Hall in the
Thirty-ninth Assembly District. His brief
address at each meeting produced a very
favorable impression.
the cause of progressive and hon
ost municipal government. Seven hundred
or more citizens crowded into the hall, and
hundreds finding: the crush so great that
they could not get in went away with a
determination to go early next Saturday
evening to Alhambra Theater on the occa
sion of the big Republican ratification
meeting. The enthusiasm of the audience
last nlg-ht was boundless. Tbe reception
accorded to Mr. Crocker attained the
spirit and force of a great popular ova
tion. The audience was representative in
character, embracing many active retail
merchants as well as prominent men of
the large commercial concerns. Every ref
erence to the urgent necessity of a practi
cal and economical business administra
tion of the affairs of San Francisco
evoked instant applause. Candidates Lane
and Schmitz were not reviled, but the in
experience of one and the incompetency
of the other were briefly dwelt upon.
The demonstration in support of the Re
publican ticket was significant in several
respects. Xo invitation to attend the
Meeting was given, other than that con
tained in the public announcement. The
attendance was unexpectedly large. Party
loaders fancied that not more than three
<>r four hundred citizens would rally, as
the campaign was hardly under way.
"When it was s=een that a thousand repre
sentative citizens had assembled and that
the enthusiasm of the audience in support
of Sir Crocker was unbounded, the spec
tators readily perceived that the current
of public approval was favorable to the
Republican nominees.
THE buslnes* men's meeting at
Union Square Hall last night
that was called to organize the
Henry J. Crocker Central Club

RICHMOND BEPTJBLICANS.
A great Republican demonstration took
place last evening at Richmond Hail, cor
ner of Fourth avenue and Clement street.
The occasion was the first open meeting
of the Crocker- Vance Club of the Thirty
ninth Assembly District. The attendance
of voters was large and the ehUitJsJasm
great. The address of Henry J. Crocker,
candidate for Mayor, was the event of tho
evening. In the Thirty-ninth District and
throughout that region of the city north
of Golden Gate Park he is more than a
party nominee. He is the candidate of
the people for Mayor of San Francisco.
as he is in sympathy with the spirit of
progress and development which animates
the residents of that beautiful section of
the metropolis.
In his speech last night Mr. . Crocker
traced the development of San Francisco
from Powell street west to the ocean.
His remarks convinced the people that ha
knew what kind of an administration* o?

of the decision of the voters in favor of
expending eighteen million dollars in pub

Henry J. Crocker entered the hall while
Mr. Dutton was speaking and almost
every person present arose and cheered
him. Mr. Crocker was escorted to the
platform and took a seat and waited until
Mr. Dutton had concluded. When Intro
duced to the big gathering Mr. Crocker
was cheered again and again. He spoke
In part aa follows:
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen and
my friends: This Is a little bit embarrassing
for a new candidate, but new candidates gen
erally make - new records. I have just come
from the outlying Th'.rty^niath District, and
I left" there with the tame music in my ears
that I encounter In this hall. I have not
heard what has been said by the various
speakers, but I don't think I will make any
repetitions, because I have very little to say.
I am your candidate for Mayor of San Fran
cisco and I Intend to win out. (Applause.)
We will take all tbe figures of the past and
wa will make a new record in this campaign,
because we have a rood legitimate right to
do so.
The Republican party that has tendered mÂ«
tha honor of thia nomination Is the party of
the people. Th* Republican party Is the party
of Theodore Roosevelt. (Applause.) And
Theodore Roosevelt has laid down to all of
us rules which we can easily " follow. Mr.
Roosevelt believes he is, and I believe him
to be, and every one knows htm to be the
candidate of tho whole people, without any
party lines, without any favoritism, without
any degree of favoritism of his party. He
has taken every line. He has taken the la
boring man. the Democrat, the Republican, the
non-partisan and every citizen of this United
States and given them a standard that we
all ' can easily follow.
It is very true that I have been one of the
workers in the ranks in the upbuilding of
San Francisco and looking' for her great fu
ture, and at this time I have the honor to
be before you as a candidate for Mayor, which
is the ercatest honor the citizens of San
Francisco can extend. I pledge myself that
I will, if elected, be the Mayor of the people

HENRY J. CROCKER
RepublicanOn Saturday last, October 3, the Exam
iner published an editorial entitled "The
Need for Honest Government." Some of
the extracts of this editorial are as fol
io w=:
JLANE IS PRAISED.
That the voters may judge for them
selves as to the inconsistency of the Ex
aminer and its chameleon-like change.
The Call publish* s to-day a few extracts
from the Examiner, leaving the. task to
the public to render its decision as to the
sincerity and trustworthiness of the Ex
aminer's advocacy of Lane on the one
side and its attacks on Republican candi
dates on the other.
A campaign of abuse of certain Repub
lican nominees has been started by the
Examiner, and day after day its pages
have been filled with fierce denunciation
of candidates on the Republican ticket.
That the Examiner will continue its cam
paign of abuse is a foregone conclusion.
It will be interesting for the voters of
San Francisco to compare the utterances
of the Examiner made one year ago and
those made at this time.
Then Gavin McNab was denounced as
the avowed enemy of labor, and his se
lection of Lane for Governor was pre
dicted as a disaster to the Democratic
party.
Then the Examiner used all means to
secure members of the labor unions to
vote against Lane, the nominee of Gavin
McNab, the enemy of the workingmen.
To-day the Examiner is supporting
Lane and beseeching the Union Labor
party to unite with the Democracy and
elect him Mayor of this ctty.
CAMPAIGN OF ABUSE.
L.ane was mentioned one year ago
as the probable nominee of the Demo
cratic party for election as Governor of
California, the Examiner bitterly attack
ed Lane and those who were associated
with him in his campaign.
Then Lane and Gavin McNab were de
nounced with fierce Invective. To-day
Lane is hailed as the Moses who will lead
the Democratic party to the promised
land of victory.

PROMINENT CAXIFORNIANS

Yet the Examiner is now championing
the cause of Lane and asking the labor
union men to vote' for him. The public
can judge for itself the inconsistency of
the Examiner's policy at this time as
compared to Its policy of last year re
garding its support of Lane.
In _the recent Democratic convention
that nominated Lane for Mayor of San
Francisco, it was known that McNab con
trolled the majority of the delegates. The
Examiner is perfectly aware of this fact
and that Lane was and is his candidate
for office.
On this page The Call reproduces an
editorial that appeared In the Examiner
on "Wednesday, September 3, 1902. The
Examiner then stated that it would not
support Franklin K. Lane, as he was the
personal candidate of Gavin McNab,
whom it designated as the avowed enemy
of labor. \
TUBNS A SOMERSAULT.
Thereupon the Examiner said:' "These
dispatches have been shown to many del
egates, so they might be Informed of the
campaign of fraud being carried on
by Gavin McNab to secure the nomina
tion of hJs candidate."
"That's their game, lies, lies, lies. They
are making a campaign based on lies. If
McNab told the truth he couldn't elect a
yellow dog. Their position, strength and
assumptions are false."
On page 2 of the Examiner of the same
date a story. was published that at Lane's
headquarters at Sacramento statements
had been given out that men were in that
city from San Francisco representing the
Retail. Clerks' Union and the Machinists'
Union. Telegrams from the president and
business agent of these unions were se
cured, denying that any representatives
were in Sacramento and stating that any
one posing as such was an Impostor.
The display of type was headed "Gom
pers refutes bold canard put In circula
tion by McNab." McNab is quoted as de
nying that he ever received such a tele
gram from Gompers or heard of such a
document.
Ex-Governor Budd was interviewed and
Is quoted as saying of the Incident:
On September 3. 1902, the Examiner dis
played in bold type on Its front page an
article stating that McNab was trying to
secure the nomination of Lane by a deli
berate fraud. It asserted that JIcNab had
displayed a telegram purporting to be
from Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, in which
Gompers indorsed the candidacy of Lane
for Governor of California.
"W. D. Englishâ I do not see how the
friends of Lane expect him to win if he
receives the nomination, with a large ma
jority of organized labor against him and
other powerful elements of his party in
opposition to his candidacy."
The Examiner now desires the members
of the Union Labor party to support
Franklin K. Lane for election as Mayor
of San Francisco. Gavin McNab has
been the means of Lane securing the
nomination on the Democratic ticket.
Contrast the present attitude of the Ex
aminer to its utterances one year ago.
CAMPAIGN OP FRAUD.
McNab played an important part in the
Democratic primaries and in the munici
pal convention of the party. The Exam
iner editorially urges the Union Labor
party to affiliate with the Democracy, yet
one year ago this is what the Examiner
published with reference to Lane's candi
dacy for Governor:
"W. D. English and John Daggett are
of the belief that if Lane be nominated
It will mean disaster to the party.
"John Daggettâ The candidacy of Lane
would be suicidal to the hopes of the
Democracy in this campaign.
In urging the election of Franklin K.
Lane as Mayor of San Francisco the Ex
aminer knows full well that Gavin McNab
is his trusted adviser.
The following day the Examiner pub
lished an editorial entitled "Where Union
Is Strength It Is Folly to Divide." The
members of the Union Labor party were
urged to affiliate with the Democracy,
whose standard-bearer waa to be Frank
lin K. Lane. The worklngmen were urged
to associate politically with the party to
be led by Lane, whom the Examiner had
denounced a year ago as being a "trusted
lieutenant of Gavin McNab, the avowed
enemy of labor."
This is what the Examiner said In its
editorial of September 24 last:
"We regret especially that the Demo
cratic Convention should have taken the
position that it cannot Join hands with
the Union Labor party. The interests of
the Democratic party and of the labor
men are the same. Opposition to privi
lege, regard for the interests of the com
mon people, are common to both. Both
place the interests of the great public
above the interests of aggregated wealth.
"There should be the same union be
tween the Democratic party and the
workingmen as there Is between the Re
publican party and the trusts.
"For this reason the Democratic party
and the Union Labor party should logic
ally be behind the same ticket. They are
both looking to the same objects in State,
national and city governments."
NOMINATION IS DISASTER.

Franklin K. Lane for Mayocof San Fran
cisco on the Democratic ticket.
During the afternoon a delightful pro
gramme was rendered. Miss Alexander
gave some of her inimitable darkv dialect
stories. The vocal renditions were greatly
appreciated by the delegates, and thus
ended the first day of the conventionâ a
day of peace, pleasure and mutual bene!U.
To-morrow the delegates will meet at
Century Hall for further deliberations
and to elect officers. It Is generally con
ceeded that the southern Dart of the State
will obtain the high offices. At the con
clusion of the routine work a presentation
will take place, when the retiring presi
dent will be tendered a flag of the lost
cause wrought in flowers.
At the meeting it was decided that Mrs.
Selden S. "Wright and Mrs. Voorhles
should attend the national convention to
be held in November at Charleston. S. C.
to which the ladles will bear every port
able evidence of California's allurements,
that the Daughters may be induced to
come to California for their national con
vention In 1903.
On Wednesday morning at o'clock
a private car, chartered by ' the Albert
Sidney Johnston Chapter, will be placed
at the disposahof delegates and Daugh
ters for an Inspection tour of the city.
On Wednesday evening, at the residence
of Mrs. R. E. Queen, 2212 Sacramento
street, the Jefferson Davis Chapter, Mrs.
Van Wyck president, will hold a reception
for the Confederate veterans and Con
federate Daughters. On Thursday after
noon at the home of Mrs. XV. A. Clark
and Mrs. William O. Minor, 2317 Dwight
way, Berkeley, a reception will be ten
dered the retirinc and incoming officers 1 ,
delegates and members of chapters.
These functions will terminate the official
affairs of the third convention of Daugh
ters of the Confederacy.
An interesting fact was developed In
regard to the table at which the delib
erations took pface. The gavel rapped
upon the very table upon which President
Madison signed the treaty of Ghent in
1S14. This interesting: relic has been an
heirloom in Mrs. Voorhles' family slnro
that eventful dar.
The Daughters of the Confederacy met
yesterday for their annual convention
at the home of Mrs. Alfred Hunter Voor
hies, on California street. The State or
ganization, composed of seven chapters,
was called to order by Mrs. Selden S.
Wright, the popular State president, who.
in a felicitous speech, welcomed the dele
gates to this, their third convention. In
a manner that would reflect credit upon
any legislative body the women set busily
about reading and listening to reports,
principal among which was that of Mrs.
Voorhles, president of the Albert Sidney
Johnston Chapter. This embodied a
resume of the good work done during the
yearâ notably the relief and comfort be
stowed upon the veterans of the warâ
they who wore the gray. And that there
are many who stand in need of succor
Â¦in the evening of their Hve3 was evident.
One had lost his homeâ his a.'lâ by fire.
Others were ill and friendless. These had
been relieved by the Daughters by the
very best means at hand, but the report
showed the manifest necessity of a per
manent system of reliefâ hospital beds,
the availability of a home, etc.. such as
is enjoyed by veterans of the Xorth. and
for this purpose the charity ban of the
23d is to be given at the Palice. The
report further stated that a compilation
of historical data of the war was one of
the duties of the coming year, when
every Confederate Daughter was to pre
sent in manuscript form such events as
she personally encountered. As the door
yards of many of these women became
battlefields these reminiscences will be of
vital Interest to us of to-dav.

the value of religion to him and expressed
a desire to go on the lecture platform.

moved to a town made up largely of God
fearing people. That was a revelation to
me. I shudder to think what I should
have been If I had remained in Rlchford
all my life.
"There are so many men who hunt a
little, fish a little, drink whisky a lltte and
only attain a little success in life and
all for the lack of a little religion. The

W., WASHINGTON, Oct. 5.â More foreign
wines have been excluded from the
United States on account of adulterations.
This time the Rhine wines have come un
der the ban of the Bureau of Chemistry
of the Agricultural Department upon cer
tification from the Secretary of Agricul
ture that the samples examined showed
the use of salicylic acid as a preserva
tive. The Secretary of the Treasury to
day directed the exclusion of a consign
ment of Rhine wine that had been shipped
from Mainz, Germany, to an importer in
Philadelphia. The exclusion of the wines
was on the ground that they were adul
terated so as to be injurious to health and
also on the ground that the sale of wines
in which salicylic acid is used is forbid
den in Germany.
1 The department also excluded to-day a
consignment of olive oil shipped from
Florence, Italy, jj to Baltimore, on the
ground that it was adulterated with other
vegetable oils and was falsely labeled as
"Pure Olive Oil." Another consignment
of olive oil shipped from Maine to Balti
more was also excluded on the ground
that It waa fasely labeled, the analysis
showing that It contained cottonseed oil
and peanut oil. These exclusions of wine
and olive oil, the officials say, cannot fail
to be of immense advantage to Califor

McNab was denounced as a foe of union

Lane was handled as a candidate for
whom the Union Labor party has no sym
pathv and no use.
"As for 'Lane himself, he worked late
and early to persuade impatient labor
leaders to believe him not allied with Mc-
Nab. In this line of toil he accomplished
nothing, for of course the labor leaders
are familiar with the situation and are

not offered.
"Knowing full well that a lot of earnest

the construction and adoption of the San

fire of the South is dying.
A MASSACHUSETTS QUESTION.
SCIENCE has done much to instruct people in
the necessities of and to point out the
things we eat that do not enter into the
nourishment of the body, but are taken to satisfy
the palate only. These surplus articles that are not
food are, as a rule, the most expensive part of the
diet, and they do not aid digestion nor assimilation,
but clog and hinder both. Americans are the greatest
caters in the world, and also the greatest wasters.
It is estimated that our population of 80,000,000
everj' day wastes enough to feed an equal number and
keep them in prime condition for all the duties of
life. It is an unpleasant reflection that any among
us should lack food, where it is so abundant and needs
only a proper distribution to fill every mouth that
craves it. The waste we make, if put where needed,
would fatten every rib on every man, woman and
child that is now in need of daily bread.
A gentleman in the Argentines is reported to
have been experimenting with his diet, with aston
ishing results. He was formerly an officer in the
navy, but does not say whether his attention was
drawn to dietetic reform by eating hard tack and
canned soup. He announces the discovery that he
can live well on five cents a day, eating only oranges
and bread. This diet amply sustains his strength and
he finds no impairment of any of his physical or
mer.tal .force resulting from its use.
His experiment proves that the cost of the neces
saries of life has increased in the last fifty years.
When Horace Greeley edited the Tribune and made
it one of the greatest newspapers ever published, he
ceaselessly taught the ways of economy in diet. Solon
Robinson was his agricultural writer, and the files
of the paper during the fifties will "disclose many of
Solon's sage observations on, domestic economy in
diet. He wrote and published in pamphlet form:
"One dime a day; how 'twas earned: how 'twas spent,
and how five mouths it fed." As we remem
ber it. he proved that at the then current market
prices in New York City ten cents sufficiently dieted
five in a family. That was two cents apiece, and beat
the Argentine gentleman by three cents a day per
head. Respecting an exclusive diet of oranges and
bread we are inclined to think that the ex-naval
officer is a case of individual physiology, and that
such a diet would not prove universally suitable.
Then the amount and kind of food necessary to sus
tain life at working pitch is affected by conditions of
climate and occupation. The Chinese laborers are
perhaps the best example of a people who can live
and toil unceasingly on the same diet from the
equator to the polar circles. With their rice, varied
but little by occasional fish, flesh or fowl, they resist
all weather and work well under a vertical sun in the
tropics, or at Nome or Dawson City.
Such experiences as that of the Argentinian, while
not to be accepted as of universal application, are use
ful in calling attention to the needless expenditure
rrade by nearly all our people upon- a diet that is not
necessary to satisfy or to strengthen them.
MASSACHUSETTS is discussing with great
ardor whether or no the Democrats of the
State should declare to the country that they

New England will probably find it difficult to under

upon such an issue, for in any other State a similar
one would be looked upon merely as a controversy
over the political prospects of a favorite son and no

The irresistible deire of a militiaman to carry into
uniform the familiarises of every-day life and to hail
his colonel as "old hoss" may be entirely consistent
with good fighting qualities when their presence is
needed. In the fine and minute points of discipline
the militia can never be brought to the precision. of
regulars. The regular does not constantly oscillate
between civil and military experience. Once enlisted
his civil experience is confined to getting drunk on
pay day. Otherwise he is constantly absorbing from
his officers and drillmaster the rigid discipline neces
sary to the professional soldier.
With the militiaman it is different. The pomp and
circumstance of military life are exceptional and his
civil life the rule. He cannot be expected to carry
over into his civil life his military discipline, to walk
as part of a formation and hold his chin at the mar
tial elevation. On the other hand his civil freedom
is inevitably carried into his occasional military ex
perience. Yet he makes a good soldier. In our
civil war the million volunteers had learned some
thing of formation and the manual of arms in the
militia, and wHt'n the hard work came they put their
heroic shoulders to it and never winced. The Na
tional Guard of California need not be ashamed of
the record of the First Regiment in our Spanish war,
nor of the patriotic patience of the Eighth, which
took arms and with other of our militia bodies stood
at attention waiting to be called into actual war.
The inspector need hot be criticized for wanting a
little more starch in our militia manners, but no one
must conclude from his strictures that our National
I Guard is lacking in the stout-hearted American ma
terial upon which the country relies for defense in
time of trial.
INSPECTOR KOSTER has gone through the
National Guard of California and doesn't like it.
The men wobble while standing: at "attention,"
are, deficient in the manners and morals of guard

AKRON, O.. Oct. 5.â A color rush at
Buchtel College to-day resulted In the
faculty suspending every man In college
except three, and they remain because
they did not reach the college until after
the rush was over. Friday night the up
per classmen initiated the freshmen, put
ting them through a severe course, and
when the latter appeared at the chapel
this morning wearing their colors. Presi
dent Church made a speech prohibiting a
color rush. He stated that the freshmen
had been initiated in a more severe man
ner than any class ever were in the in
stitution, and he upheld them in wear
ing their colors. 'As soon as chapel was
over the upper classmen went after the
freshmen and tore their colors off, and
bloody noses and torn clothes were in
evidence. The faculty then suspended
both classes.

PORTLAND, Oct. 5.â The heads of all
colleges in Oregon have taken action to
check the excessive devotion of students
to football. December 1 has been adopted
unanimously as' the close of the season
and it was decided to organize a senior
and a junior league of all the colleges and
secondary educational institutions, with
the object of preventing games with out
side clubs, which are considered as in
jurious to the students.
A committee has been appointed to in
vestigate all cases of professionalism and
with power to reinstate members as ama
teurs for the purpose of the proposed
leagues. Some of the students from in
terior towns have infringed the rules of
amateurism by competing for money
prizes at Fourth of July meets and in
other unimportant events. An effort -was
made to discourage games on Thanksgiv
ing day, but no motion on the subject was
carried. Other subjects discussed were
the relationship of athletics to study and
their control by the faculty. No action
was taken on these matters, but the sense
of the conference of teachers was that
absolute control of athletics should rest
as a final resort in the faculty.

Many accidents happen through the carelessness
or negligence of street railway employes. The cars
frequently start while a passenger is getting on
or off. Children, in playing upon the streets, are
run down by the cars. Vehicles are collided with and
their occupants thrown out. In all these injuries,
when inflicted upon any railroad operated by private
parties, the courts are open to the injured for redress,
and if he establishes the negligence of the railroad
company's emploves juries are very quick to award
" .... . "Â¦Â¦-:;
ample damages. If these injuries happen on the rail
road operated by the city, the injured party would
be demurred out of court and his wTongs go unre
dressed. It therefore would behoove people to ride
on the cars of the United Railroads which parallel the
Geary- street road rather than on the Geary-street
road if it is operated by the city.
It is true the charter may be changed, but we can
only act under the law that is in existence, and this
law exempts the city from liability for any such
injuries. t
TÂ»HIÂ£ charter provides (section 5, article I) that
I there shall be no recourse against the city and
county for damage to person or property suf
fered or sustained by reason of accident on any street.
If the city constructs and operates the Geary-street
road it will be no more free from accidents than are
other street railroads. In fact, if its supervision over
the street railway is as lax as is generally the super
vision of political officials over their subordinates,
there will be more accidents, more injuries inflicted
by the negligence and carelessness of the employes
of this railroad than of other railroads. The city,
however, by reason of the charter, is exempt from
liability for such injuries. The result will be that the
people injured on the Geary-street road will be un
able to recover damages for injuries suffered thereby,
however serious and permanent may be these in-

Street railways are proper objects for
the investment of surplus capital, and
many of our citizens hold the bonds of
this road, by means of winch they draw
dividends and thereby add to their small
revenues. The laboring man, the me
chanic, the man of small means, the man
who paves and wishes to advance him
self in this world's prosperity, by the pur
chase of a few bonds has his Income in
creased. If he is taxed in order that the
city may become the purchaser, he has to
put his money into the road whethpr or
no, but it would puzzle even a Philadel
phia lawyer to find out when he is going
to receive a corresponding benefit. The
city has no. surplus fund by means of
which it could become the owner, and the
only way it can get the money Is by
means of a compulsory loan, or in other
words a direct tax.
'Whenever there is a sufficient surplus
in the treasury to warrant the city in be
coming an Investor in private enterprises,
it will then be time to consider what will
be most profitable, and at the same time
be that which will benefit every citizen,
to whom the money properly belongs.
There is another view to be taken of
the matter. It would be an unjust dis
crimination. If the charter of the Geary
street road is renewed until the charter
of the United Railroads expires, and then,
if it should be deemed wise and safe, let
the city assume the ownership and con
trol of the entire system, there would be
at least a semblance of consistency and
fairness in the proposition. But until
then ordinary justice would suggest that
the Geary street road be placed on the
same plane with all others and that no
unwise or unjust experiments be made at
this time.
The colored vote of this city is suffi
ciently large to have an influence In the
result of election. Let him put on his
thinking cap for a moment and ask him
self this question: "Wherein am I to be
benefited by passing the control of thi3
road to the citv. and what Injustice to
the rights of others may I not assist in
doing if I should vote in the affirmative?"
The right minaed thinking man will vote
"No." Go to the polls on Thursday. Oc
tober 8 and put your cross opposite the
word "No."-The Pacific Coast Appeal.
On Thursday, October 8, the voters of
this city will be called upon to . s&y
whether they will be taxed to obtain what
private enterprise has already secured
them, or whether they will be content
to enjoy the privileges they now have
without the additional luxury of being
taxed for it. v The acquisition of the road
by the city will not inure to the advan
tages of any other than the few politi
cians who are figuring for political power
and personal aggrandizement. One thing
is certain, and that is that under no con
sideration or in any manner will the col
ored contingent be benefited by the own
ership of the Geary street railroad. On
the contrary they will find it to their ben
efit to vote "No" to the proposition sub
mitted to them.

THE city campaign is just warming up and will
scon be in the lurid stage. It is a triangular
fight. At two of the corners stand Mayor
Schmitz and Mr. Lane, respectively. Their places
on the diamond may be known without putting an ear
to the ground. They are identified by vociferation.
Each of those gentlemen has circumnavigated him
self and each submits a chart for public approval.
Mr. Lane has notified the public of his entire satis
faction with himself. He has looked himself over
and fearlessly declares that he is satisfied with him
self. He finds no flaw anywhere, and sees no reason
why his office-holding career shall not be indefi
nitely extended, inasmuch as he is convinced that he
is unique, the only article of the kind now in stock,
and that h*e is a public necessity. If the people will
only agree with him, accept him as a phenomenon
and as one of the necessaries of life, he will confer
upon them the favor of continuing in office.
Mayor Schmitz is not backward on his corner.
He has announced his approval of hinfself and all of
his works. He has gone somewhat further than Mr.
Lane, on a line that Lane has perhaps reserved for
future exploitation. The Mayor has approved of his
own oratory and tells his constituents that he is en
tranced by the echo of his- own eloquence. He has
uttered the opinion that his oratorical efforts in rep
resenting the city before the facejof distinguished vis
itors have been fine, and have received the approval
of all hearers, including himself. He insists, in fact,
that he, and not Mr. Lane, is "It" when it comes to
the parts of speech.
While these two gentlemen are telling all they
know about themselves, and each is tugging away
at the boot straps of his own good opinion of him
self in the effort to lift himself into office, Mr.
Crocker is silent on his corner and does not venture
to ratify himself at all. He has lived his life here,
and his daily walk has been among the people of
San Francisco. Some approve of him and some do
not, as is the fashion with men. He may have quali
ties in their line as remarkable as those that the
other candidates have discovered in themselves. If
so, it is enough for the people to discover them in
his acts and not in his words. He is a business man,
and such are men of deeds and not of words.
So, while the Labor party and Democratic corners
of the triangle resemble the stocks of gay flowers
for sale on the Chronicle corner, and Mayor Schmitz
and Mr. Lane are throwing orchids at themselves,
the Republican corner is not in bloom with that class
of flowers.
But for all that Mr. Crocker is not left without
witnesses, though he does not testify in his own be
half. From all over the State rises testimony to his
useful service in behalf of the rural industries and
J production of California. A few years ago the vin
; tage of this State languished. The vineyards were
without profit and their owners without credit. Vines
were being uprooted and grape-growers were in the
agony of sacrifice of their costly plantations to change
their industry in the desperate hope of saving their
lands from the prevalent mortgage that rested upon
the vines of hill and valley throughout the State.
To revive that industry, make it "profitable, save
the homes of the growers and save to the State mil
lions of investment, was a task as great and in some
respects more difficult than the righteous government
of San Francisco. To that task Mr. Crocker set him
self with energy and intelligence. Almost before thl?
State knew what had happened the change came, the" 3 ;
transformation was effected. The vineyard industry
was regenerated, and profit and contentment took the
place of loss and disappointment. This was done by
Mr. Crocker's skill in business organization. The
trouble was not lack of fruitfulness in the vineyards,
of skill and industry in the planters, but it was in the
lack of proper commercial organization of the in
dustry. The grape-growers had been in the grasp
of a monopoly that controlled commerce in the vin
tage. He carried commercial principles, and a just
share of the profits, back to every vine that purpled in
the sunshine of California, and when it was done
he did not mount an eminence and cry out to all
passers: "Come, all ye gallant gentlemen, and take a
look at me! I did it," but he was content to have
done something, to have acted well in an emergency,
and left approval and praise to others, if they were
minded to approve and praise.
Now these planters, from far apart sections of the
State, noting his nomination for Mayor of this city,
unable to vote for him, yet unwilling to be silent,
are formally expressing their unforgotten obligation
to him, and from every vineyard in California rises
a note of approval of Henry J. Crocker. What the
planters say he did for their industry was a material
benefit. It was not thrilling audiences with oratory,
nor was it seeking the emoluments of office and
posing in the public eye as an object of interest.
But it was a real service, that turned loss into profit,
lifted mortgages, paid debts, built better homes, sent
sons and daughters to school, effaced the hard lines
of life and made a brighter light in many a window.
It also had its favorable reaction upon many lines of
business in this city. It put cash in place of credit
at myriad country stores, and cash in place of credit
into the dealings of the country merchant with the
city jobber. Yet Mr. Crocker did not brag about it,
and if it cause bouquets to be thrown to his corner
they are cast voluntarily by others, by men of all
parties, and are not thrown by himself to himself.
We by no means minimize the merits of Mayor
Schmitz and Mr. Lane. If we wanted to, they
would not permit it. Their trombones are in
too good order for that. No one can get
even a small word in edgewise in regard to
them, for they monopolize all the- language of
eulogy in describing themselves. There is not a
single adjective, verb or adverb employed in laudation
left idle. They are working the ascriptive part of
the language into that tired feeling upon themselves,
their qualities, their merits and their virtues. But
above all this auction at which they bid upon them
selves at their own estimate of their value comes the
clear, far note from hill and valley, raised by volun
teers, that Henry J. Crocker did something of im
portance to his fellow citizens and the State and
didn't brag about it.

New England it is different. TJie issue there runs
beyond Mr. Olney and Democracy and takes in the
big question of the availability of New England men
as candidates for ijhe Presidency.
The issue arises in this way: Aniong the domi
nant set of politicians in the New England States
there has grown up a belief- since Blaine's time that
as those States are sure for the Republican candi
date, no matter who he may be, it would be poor
politics for the Republicans to nominate a New Eng
lander. They argue that the same set of facts make
it equally inexpedient for Democrats to nominate a
New Englander. Hence they say to present the name
of Olney as the choice of Massachusetts' Democ
racy would be self-stultification, since it would de
prive the delegates from that State of a chance to
make advantageous trades with candidates from other
States. Under such circumstances it will be seen the
Olney question becomes a New England question/ or
rather a question between the practical politicians
and the theorists of New England. To nominate
Olney as the candidate of the State for the Presi
dency would be to put Massachusetts in the field of
President-makers, and, according to the politicians,
that honor belongs exclusively to doubtful States like
Ohio, Illinois and New York.
The Olney men assert with vehemence that the
nation is really yearning for a return of their fa
vorite to politics. Henry Nelson Loomis says: "I
have crossed the continent twice within the last two
months, and I say what I know to be the truth when
I state that Mr. Olney is the ideal candidate in the
thought of the men of the West, and of the North
west, and of the Pacific Coast, who prefer a man of
character at the head of the republic to a boy of noise
and confusion* Day by day the issue is settling
down in the minds of the people, here and every
where, between character and furious exaltation; be
tween a real and understanding love for the demo
cratic institutions of the republic on the one side,
and, on the other, the shouts of a multitude led by
a man who has no regard for constitutional principles
or for individual liberty if the rights of man inter
fere with his impulse to establish an arbitrary pa
ternalism."
That is a brave statement bravely made, but a man
who has been across the continent and has found
along the route a boom for Olney is evidently a man
who is liable to see visions in the night.: No slight
est sign of a boom for Olney has been seen or heard
of outside of New England. In the South and in the
West his name is never mentioned, and even in New
York and Pennsylvania it is seldom noted by the
Democratic press. The issue is, in short, a strictly
New England question; and even there the interest
in it is doubtless mainly of an academic nature.

he did not consider the racetrack a proper
place to raise a youth. Since the hearing
young McGowan has not been seen by
any one interested in his welfare and it

Words of censure burst sternly from the
lips of United States District Judge de
Haven yesterday when First Assistant
United States District Attorney Banning
asked for a postponement of the trial of
I the case of the United States againxt
i Jrmes M. Engle and others for conspiracy
and subornation of perjury. The judicial
censure was directed against the office
of the United States District Attorney,
because several very important witnesses
for the Government had not been served
with process compelling their attendance.
Mr. Banning said afterward that the
court's censure was unjust and uncalled
for, because the District Attorney's of
fice had filed the summons with the
United States Marshal on September 7.
and the District Attorney's office should
not have been held responsible for the
failure of the Marshal's deputy to find
the witnesses. Since the beginning of
the prosecution, he said, the missing wit
nesses, all of whom were employes of the
defendant at Loyalton, Sierra County, had
gone to other parts of the State and could
not be found.
On behalf of the United States Mar
shal's office, it was said that the office
force ia too small to do the work re
quired of it, Deputy De Lancie being con
fined to his home by sickness and the of
fice being in the throes I of the Chinese
substitution scandal at the time the pre
cipe was issued.
The defendants, James M. Engle, Wil
liam S. Lewis, Richard H. Lewis and Ar
thur M. Keddle, are wealthy and respect
ed citizens of Sierra County. In conjunc
tion with Captain J. H. Roberts, a well
known steamboat man, they erected a
large sawmill at Loyalton and built the
Boca and Loyalton Railroad to connect
their mill with the heart of the big pine
timber. Captain Robert* advanced them
$40,000 for the purpose of buying timber
lands to supply the mill with work, and
in consequence of the establishment of
this new industry the population of Loy
alton leaped from 50 souls to 2000 within
a few years.
Denson & Schlesinger, who appeared for
the defendants, strenuously objected .to
any postponement of the trial, Mr. Schles
inger calling the attention of the court
to' the fact that the case had been hang-
Ing fire for more than a year. Judge
de Haven remarked that up to the pres
>crit day the defendants had not seemed
very anxious for a speedy trial, where
upon Mr. Schleslnger retorted that he had
waited for three months for a decision on
a demurrer.
The court fixed November 6, peremptor
ily, for the trial. .

The Hoard of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution requesting the City
Attorney to advise the Board of Super
rfaton what action and procedure is nec
tssary on Its part to bring the question
of the validity of the bond issue before
the Supreme Court of the State of Califor
nia at the earliest possible date. The
preamble of the resolution says:
The electors of the city and county of Kan
Francisco, at th# election hold on September
;S<. l!KiS. rxjiressed themselves In favor of the
The first step In a determined effort
to take the management of tha public
pound cut of the hands of Harry Irwln,
the eppolntee of Mayor Schmitz, was
taken yesterday at a meeting of the Su
pervisors' Finance Committee.
Two propositions were considered by
the committee, either of which will de
prive Irwin of his Job. The first is to
turn the pound over to the police de
partment, the second to place Its man
agement In the hands of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or
the Pacific Humane Society.
Chairman Brandensten expressed him
self in favor of the police department
managing the public pound. Chief of
Police Wittman stated that ho had con
sulted with the Police Commissioners,
who said they were willing to take the
responsibility.
"It would be necessary to appropriate
sufficient money to maintain the pound,"
said Wittman. ""I could delegate a ser
geant to supervise the work, and I think
the pound could be handled in satisfac
tory manner. All fees, of course, would
be turned over to the city.
"1 am of the opinion that the police
should operate the pound, even if. it
would cost the city some money. The
fees could be materially Increased by col
lecting them on dogs that are kept housed
up by owners to escape the payment of
license."
Representatives of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and
the Pacific Human* Society offered to
run the pound If the city would appro
priate 5500 per month for the purpose, and
agreed to turn all foes collected back to
the city and to keep it free from criti
cism.
Poundkeeper Irwin asked that the mat
ter go over for one week, as he desired
to present evidence to show that he had
turned more money into the city treas
ury than his predecessors. To a ques
tion of Brandensten Irwin replied that
he had been appointed poundkeeper by
Mayoft Schmitz.
"How do you explain that the pound
cost the city $3000 in addition to $5000 ap
propriated originally under your manage
ment?" aBked Brandensten. "These gen
tlemen offer to do the work free of cost
to the city, and if we can save $3000 we
propose to sacrifice you."
"You will not sacrifice me," replied
Irwln, "for I am able to take care of
myself. I would like to have a week to
present my side of the case," said Irwin.
Further consideration was then post
poned for one week.
May Put It in Hands of Police
or of Some Humane
Society.

Investigation developed the fact that the
Foresters had held a meeting and dance
in their lodge rooms Saturday night and
that Olivera had attended the celebration.
Directly above the spot where the man
was found several hours after the close
of the dance, is a balcony which connects
with the lodee rooms. It is presumed
that Olivera, fell from this balcony
and that the accident was not per
ceived by any of the persons in
side. The rail of the balcony was broken
and bears evidence of having sustained
heavy outward pressure, several of the
supports being parted from their fasten
ings.

CALL, BUREAU. 1406 O STREET. N.
W., WASHINGTON, Oct. 5.â President
Roosevelt, without any intention of
taking one side or the other, to-day dealt
a blow to the Addicks faction In Dela
ware by appointing John D. -Nlelds of
Wilmington United States District Attor
ney, to succeed William Michael Byrne.
Nields was the choice of Senator Ball,
while Senator Alice, known as an Ad
dicks Senator, had recommended another
man. Both Senators conferred with ftie
Presl3ent last week over the appointment,
and failed to agree. The President told
them at the time that If they could not
come together he would take thÂ© matter
into his own hands and make his own ap
pointment. This he did to-day.
In the White House announcement, It
is said, that as the two Senators had dis
agreed on the matter, the President had
examined the indorsements of all the
candidates recommended, taking into first
consideration the opinions of the judiciary
and bar. He found that both Federal and
State Judges and members of the Dela
ware bar were overwhelmingly In favor of
Nlelds. It is known that Judge George
Gray, chairman of the Coal Strike Com
mission, was strongly In favor of Nields.
but there is no reason to believe that this
had much weight with the President in
making his selection.

EUREKA, Oct. 5.â The recent order
from the United States Land Office at
Washington withdrawing from settlement
or appropriation 806,400 acres of timber
land in Humboldt, Trinity, Tehama and
Shasta counties has fallen with crushing
effect on the local land office here, and
on hundreds of citizens who have filed on
the lands withdrawn but have not yet
proved up on their claims. About all that
will remain for the local land officers to
do now^_since this large tract of timber
Is to go" into the Klamath River forest
reserve will be to pick up the fag ends
of the business, hear the contests that
are pending and attend to the littl^ drib
ble of business that may come.
At one stroke the Eureka office will
shrink from one of the best paying of
fices In the country to one the fees from
which will hardly pay running expenses."
The Register and Receiver will suffer
greatly by this withdrawal of about all
the available timber in the county. Their
salaries are in great measure dependent
on the amount of business done in the
year and the revenue turned over to the
Government.
Most- of the land that has been with
drawn by tills order would soon have
been proved up on at the local land of
fice at Eureka. About 400 claimants have
proved up on IGO-acre claims In this tract.
The Commissioner, however, has not
passed on them and they are being held
up pending Investigation by special
agents.
At the local land office it is learned that
the telegram withdrawing the land de
scribed from "settlement or any appro
priation" may and quite likely will pre
vent those who have timber land applica
tions on which proof has not been made
from making proof or getting the land,
as it has been held that applications un
der the timber and stone act are not
based upon bona fide settlement and are
not such claims upon the land applied for
as would effect a segregation thereof.
This being the case, it is a question if
every timber claim advertised for proof
in all the land withdrawn by this tele
gram is not lost to the applicant.
It is also learned that there Is In the
neighborhood of 100,000 acres of lieu scrip
In the Eureka office which the owners
have applied to place on the vacant lands
In the withdrawn district. As the local
office does not pass on the scrip locations
It Is not known whether they will be al
lowed to stand or not As regards the
timber land claimants, it is believed they
will not be allowed to prove up and will
lose their publication fees, locator's fees
and all expenses they have incurred. The
land office here will ask by wire for defi
nite Instructions from the Oeneral Land
Office In regard to allowing proofs to be
made on claims already advertised, and
they must be governed by these instruc
tions.

This prisoner protested vigorously
against his arrest, but Hazen paid no
heed and took the prisoner to the Federal
building and turned him, over to the post
office inspectors, by whom he was after
ward taken to the City prison.
McDoonell is 59 years old. He was ar
rested s^n April 24, 1901, by United States
Secret Service Agents Hazen and Moffltt
for counterfeiting.
He and two others rented a basement on
Bush street and - for two months they
experimented with steel dies and silver,
one of the gang being an engraver. All
the while they were under surveillance of
the Government detectives. A drop
weight of 190 pounds was used In the
basement to try the dies and they were
cracked three times by the weight.
A female relative of McDonnell, who
occupied the upper portion of the house,
became suspicious and ordered the gang
out of the house. They shipped the ap
paratus to San Diego by steamer and set
it up In the rear of a shooting gallery in
that town. McDonnell then approached
William A. Pinkerton, the private de
tective, and requested him to sound Hazen
as to what reward Hazen would give him
for informing on his pals. After the ar
rest of the gang McDonnell's companions
testified against him. Judgo de Haven
charged the Jury that no crime had been
committed as the dies had not been cut
sufficiently deep to make a counterfeit
coin that would deceive a person of ordi
nary intelligence. The jury, after six
hours' deliberation, returned a verdict of
"not guilty."
On searching McDonnell's trunks last
night Agent Hazen found letters from all
parts of the country from parents and
other relatives of soldiers in the Philip
pines stating that they each had for
warded to him $1 for a photo of their be
loved one. In return McDonnell sent
them a group picture of a transport
leaving the dock with a crowd of soldiers
on deck. For this offense he Is charged
with having used the mails to defraud.
gang yesterday at the corner of
Kearny and Sutter streets. McDonnell Is
wanted by the Postofflce authorities for
using the United States mails with In
tent to defraud the gullible. When Mc-
Donnell saw Hazen he attempted to break
away through the crowd', but tho agile
detective had him by the collar in a
twinkling.

than that tendered Fuller upon his. return
to the stewards' stand after having won
the second race on Irene Lindsey. That

ran away for half a mile, taking two

caught hurriedly and brought back to the
actual start and went on in pursuit of

"Irtne Lindsey wins!" The news seemed
too bochI to be true, for many had given

FEDERAL ORDER
CUTS THE FEES
At the Sausalito poolrooms yesterday
all tickets on The Fiddler, aggregating
more than $13,000, were paid without pro
test.
The Jockey Club officials were able to
obtain from the Prince his oral descrip
tion of the horse, which corresponded ex
actly with The Fiddler's marks. The in
vestigation is v still poing on, the Jockey
Club stewards having wired for informa
tion to various parts of the country.
NEW YORK, Oct. 5.-After the fifth
race at Morris Park to-duy hundreds of
curious horsemen Inspected in the pad
dock the horse that on Saturday under
the name of The Fiddler won for his
backers so much money 4 from the Western
bookmakers that some of the layers at
Chicago declined to pay off the bets until
the officials at >rorris Park had made an
investigation and confirmed the identity
of the horse. An Investigation has been
in progress s!ncc rumors began to circu
late that there was something wrong with
the race. The point at issue was whether
the horse that won Saturday was the
same animal which raced under the name
of The Fiddler at St. Louis and San
Francisco. All horsemen now in this vi
cinity who had seen The Fiddler run In
California were requested by the stewards
to examine hin- Among these were G.
B. Morris, Matthew W. Storn, long con
nected with California tracks and former
ly trainer for Frederick Gebhard; R. A.
Smith, trainer of Articulate, and others.
All these men said that to the best of
their knowledge It was \the same horse.
Morris stated that in California the horse
was light In flesh, but allowing for Im
provement due to good care there was no
doubt in his mind that The Fiddler of
Morris Park was The Fiddler of Califor
nia. Oddly enough, Prince Poniatowskl.
who should of all others be able to Iden
tify The Fiddler, was within an hour's
journey of Morris Park, but was unable
to reach it because he was booked to sail
for Europe to-day. Poniatowskl at one
time owned The Fiddler.

POLITICAL PLUM
GOES TO NIELDS
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 5.-J. Weller Reed,
formerly cashier of the Loa Angeles
branch of the California Fruit Canners'
Association, has been arrested here on
the charge of embezzlement. He lodged
a coniDlaint with the police against a
woman whom he charged with robbing
him of $2000. The police arrested him on
descriptions from Los Angeles, where he
is wanted- for embezzling $5000 from his
employers. He was placed under arrest
and confessed, saying he would return
to Los Angeles without a requisition.
Reed has beÂ«n stopping at a hotel here
under the alias of "Johnson."
Reed carried the stolen money in two
rolls and in different pockets and the
woman or women who robbed him took
only one roll. Reed is 46 years old- The
association will recover $2067 found on
Reed when he was arrested.
LOS ANGELES. Oct. 5.-J. Weller Reed,
the absconder arrested in St. Louis, had
been for fourteen years cashier of the
Los Angeles branch of the California
Fruit Canners' Association, having been
connected with the association long be
fore the amalgamation of interests. He
enjoyed the confidence of the entire busi
ness community and was so Implicitly
trusted by his emp;oyers that when the
manager went out of town for any length
of time he left signed blank checks with
Reed for the latter to fill out hi paying
bills. On September 26 Reed filled out
checks to the amount of $4330, cashed
them and disappeared. ' He left a wife
and seven children in almost destitute
circumstances. The cause of Reed's
downfall has been a mystery to his
friends and family. There were persist
ent rumors that a young Spanish girl
was at the bottom of the trouble and
bad accompanied Reed, but she was found
Tiere a few days ago. The Canners' As
sociation offered a reward oÂ£ 5300 for
Reed's capture and this will "go to the
St. Louis officers. Requisition papers
will be made out and a detective sent
to bring Reed back to Los Angeles*

refused to tell where he had buried it.
Beeler left for San Antonio to-day. The
two detectives were at his side. They are
not limited as to the tlme^pf their ser
vice in this particular cas^ They will
shadow the former convict for years if
necessary to discover where the stolen
money is hidden in order that the Judg
ment now pending against Beeler may be
executed. Under these circumstances
Beeler may not be able to obtain the rest
and enjoyment that he anticipated before
his release from prison.
Beeler was met at the prison door to
day by two of the most expert detectives
In the employ of the express company.
They are detailed to watcn every move
ment of thÂ« former convict and follow
him until they discover where more than
$50,000 of the stolen money Is hidden.
Only $200 was recovered from Beeler. al
though he was captured a few days after
he had committed the robbery. He Is not
known to have had any accomplices.
Wells, Fargo & Co. obtained Judg
ment aeainst him for $50,000. This Judg
ment Is still In effect and it is the pur
pose of the two detectives to enforce its
collection. They are at least determined
that Beeler shall not get hold of his Ill
gotten gains.
Beeler was driving an express wagon
for Wells. Fargo & Co. In San An
tonio when the theft was committed. One
evening In December, nearly four years
ago, Beeler started on his wagon for the
Southern Pacific depot with a safe con
taining $53,200 In money, which was to be
shipped to Houston. The money was in
bank notes and gold and Beeler never
reached the railroad depot.

Those who have ever felt its keen, cutting pains, or witnessed the intense
suffering of others, know that Rheumatism is torture, and that it is right-
ly called "The King of Pain."
* Alldonotsufferalike. Some are suddenly seized with the most excrucia-
ting pains, and it seems every muscle and joint in the'body was being torn
asunder. Others feel only occasional slight pains for weeks or months, when
a sudden change in the weather or exposure to damp, chilly winds or- night
air brings on a fierce attack, lasting for days perhaps, and leaving the pa-
tient with a weakened constitution or crippled and deformed for all time.
An acid, polluted condition of the|blood is the cause of every form and
variety of Rheumatism, Muscular, Articular, Acute, Chronic, Inflammatory
and Sciatic, and the blood must be purged and purified before there is an
end to your aches and pains. External applications, the use of Hniments and
plasters, do much toward temporary relief, but such treatment does not reach
the real cause or cleanse the diseased blood ; but S. S. S., the greatest of all
blood purifiers and topics, does cure Rheumatism by antidoting and neutraliz-
ing the poisonous acids and building up the weak and sluggish blood. It is
S^mm^ safe and reliable in all forms of Rheumatism. It makes

Baker, a workman, into a section of the
pipe 300 feet in length. Baker went first

try. We have more than 400,000.000 people,
and with civilization and education we should
be the greatest power of the world.
At the conclusion of his speech Mr.
Iieong was greeted with congratulations
and compliments for the progress he has
made and the bravery he has shown in
connection with his work.
Following Leong's speech was a short
address by President David Starr Jordan,
in which he expressed his sympathy . for
the unfortunate conditions that prevail
in China and his encouragement for the
man who has risked hla life and is doing
so much good for his country.
Mr. Symmes, president of the Mer
chants' Association, also delivered a short
address,' In which he compared our condi
tion with that of China, the decay of
many public improvements furnishing the
theme. .

THE GBEATEST POWER.
It Is tho nlm of our association to brins the
Chinese subjects to a colnt wherp they can
realize the necessity of reforming the present
Btyle of government. There was never a
country reformed without a great loss of blood,
and though we may be accused of belnc over
arfldous to cause bloodshed It U only our own
blood that w,o stand ready to see shed. We
have shed blood and. gentlemen, we are^fady
to shed more to the last dror>. but we must
have a change, and It must talc* ptaca soon.
You may say. gentlemen, that the world U
civilized. It Is not civilized. China is not
civilized, and until It la the world Is unciv
ilized. YV*l:at we want this evening is your
sympathy and your appreciation of the critical
condition that my poor country is now in. The
United States is one of the greatest powers of
the world and it is a new country. All things
must have a beginning. Georjy Washington
was the beginning of this country. He was
your first President, and who knows but that
some one of these young countrymen of mln*
you see hera this evening, who are . now being
educated at your finest university, the Uni
versity of California â who knows but one of
them may In the near future be the beginning
of his country? A new China? We need edu
cation, we need railroads, we need telegraph
systems, telephone systems and newspapers.
All these are necessary to a great country,
and we must have them.
ASSOCIATION'S AIMS.
China is composed of two classes of people:
the class that is hearted by the Empress
Dowager and is trying to keÂ«p the country In
the stato cf uncivilizatiori and barbarism that
It is In to-day and the r.laJS that Is and has
been busily at work for the last four years
Btrlvtnjr to ralsa China to a footlne with other
great nations.
Leong Kai Cheu, who does not speak
the English language, addressed the as
sembly and his remarks, which were as
follows were interpreted by his secre
tary, Pow Chee.
The Chinese Empire Reform Associa
tion was organized four years ago, but
the six persons who were instrumental in
the starting of the association were Im
mediately arrested and put to death with
out trial by tne order of the Empress
Dowager of China. Leong Kai Cheu. who
is still a man In the early thirties, imme
diately took ud the work where It was
left off by his unfortunate predecessors,
and though a large reward wa3 immedi
ately onered by the Empress for him,
either dead or alive, he continued the
work, and at the present time the society
boasts of 4.000.CGO members.
The dinner was served at the restau
rant of Chan Mun Shanjj, 710 Jackson
street. Many Chinese merchants
were present. Mr. Leong Kai Cheu
has for the last four years made
a tour of the leading countries
of ;the world â¢ In behalf of the asso
ciation he represents, which is organized
for the purpose of reforming China and
putting her on a footing with other coun
tries.
A large banquet vras given last evening
by the members of the Chinese Empire
Reform Association to their grand vice
president, Leong Kai Cheu. The banquet
was attended by several of San Fran
cisco's most prominent men. Among
those present were Professor David Starr
Jordan, Mr. Symms, Professor Haskell of
the University of California and Mr. Hart
North, chief of the Immigration Bureau.
This all happened about 10 o'clock at
nigrht, while the family including the
housekeeper, Mrs. Christina Madsen, were
in bed. The housekeeper had previously
hoard some one moving about in the base
ment. The house was soon filled ' with
smoke and Thompson ran down to see
what was the trouble. The basement was
ablaze then and Thompson thought his
house was doomed, but he used a hose
with so much effect that the flames were
soon put out.
Krie Thompson, a ship carpenter resid
ing at 1213 Haskell street, believes that
his formfr wife, Mrs. Christina Thomp-
Fon, tried to burn himself and two child
ren out of house and home Saturday
night and to-day he applied to Justice
of the Peace Edgar for a warrant for her
arrest on a charge of arson. Justice Ed
gar advised him to apply to the District
Attorney for a warrant and he did so,
but as he had no direct evidence con
necting his former wife with the crime
the application was denied.
The Incendiary made a determined ef
fort to burn the roof from over the heads
of what remains of the Thompson family.
Four firts were started in the basement.
One was a blazing pan of shavings buried
In the coal bin, another wa3 a burning
pile of kindling wood, another was a bot
tle full of blazing oil and still another
was a hemp curtain being slowly eaten
by flre.

that it had no jurisdiction in the case of
Walter N. Dimmick. who is attempting to
secure prison credits to shorten his term
at San Quentin. The prisoner alleges that
he is entitled to whatever credits are al
lowable under the laws of the. State, al
though he is serving a sentence Imposed
by a Judge of the Circuit Court. Dlm
mlck's attorney will carry the case to the
Unittd States Supreme Court on a writ of
error.
Two petitions for writs of mandate were
filed in the. Supreme Court yesterday re
questing that Auditor Baehr be forbid
den to continue making calculations for
the collection of taxes on the assessment
of the State Board of Equalization. It is
desired that he make two separate cal
culations, one for the city and county,
based on the assessment approved by the
Board of Supervisors, and the other for
the State, based on the assessment of the
Board of Equalization. B. P. Oliver and
D L. Buckley are the petitioners. An
alternative writ has been granted and the
hearing will take place next -Friday morn
ing at the Supreme Court.
Supreme Court Decides That It Has
No Jurisdiction in the

Â£^-r^ HE chances for the Coating of the
jl bark Gifford. stranded near Mus
jj eel Rock, grow brighter daily.
**Â¦ Yesterday Captain Woodside had
. " a big jrang of men at work and
the cargo of coal was being rapidly
thrown overboard on the shore side. An
additional crew of twenty men was pent
out late in the afternoon, and to-day,
when the second donkey engine is put to
vork on the after hatch, it will not take
long to jettison onough of the cargo to
cause the vessel to float.
Three treat mushroom anchors have
been placed cut in the open sea by the
tug Relief, and thc-Fe are attached to the j
Gifford by heavy iron cables, which pre- |
vent her from moving further shorev.-ard. ,
Captain Mctcalfe is very sanguine of >
success in the undertaking, and if the;
present fine weather continues he fee!s j
pure that success will reward his under- i
taking.- The sea, which had been swash- j
Ing over the bark's decks, has now i
calmed down, eo that only the Fpray of !
en occasional breaker flashes over. At â¢
present there is about e'.ght feet of water j
in her hold, but her pumps are fully ade- I
quate to reduce this the moment she com- j
mences to raise.
Crowds of people have been on the beach
Â¦watching the work on the vessel and |
speculating ns to the outcome of the
wreckers' attempts at saving the ship.
With twenty-four hours more of fine j
weather and a comparatively smooth f=ea j
the Gifford will in all probability be lifted j
from her rocky nest, and under the tow
Of the two powerful tugs, the Relief ami i
Alert, that are standing by, will be hauled {
into the open sea and brought in through j
the Golden Gate.

In the appeals of Percy P. Moore, aa ad
ministrator of the estate of Frances J.
P. Moore, deceased, vs. the Bank of Brit
ish Columbia and Walter Young, and of
the Bank of British Columbia vs. Percy
P. Moore and others, the Court of Ap
peals affirmed the judgment of the United
States Circuit Court in one particular and
modified it very substantially in another.
The original action was brought to re
cover 5000-% shares of the capital stock of
the Sanger Lumber Company, which It
was alleged Mrs. Frances Moore had
given to the bank in trust for a certain
purpose with permission to reissue the
stock. The stock was reissued in the
name of Walter Young and when Mrs.
Moore or her representative demanded the
stock the bank exacted J98.750. which in
cluded assessments and interest. The Cir
cuit Court rendered judgment to the ef
fect that upon payment to the bank of
JS8.G00 the bank should deliver the stock
to Mrs. Moore. Both parties to the con
troversy were dissatislied with the judg
ment and appealed. Tho United States
Circuit Court of Appeals decided yester
day that the bank should surrender the
stock to Mrs. Moore's estate without the
payment of money "or any other thing";
that the bank itself had failed to pay the
i assessments on the stock: that it had
j failed to notify Mrs. Moore of the assess
ments, and that the stock had been given
to it by Mrs. Moore as a cestui qui trust.
; The following cases were also decided:
I United States of America vs. Montana
Lumber and Manufacturing Company, the
i Northern Pacific Railway Company et al.;
action to recover " $15,000 for lumber cut
! on Government land in Montana. The
j lower court decided in favor of the Mon
tana company. It was decided to submit
several questions of law â¢ to the United
States Supreme Court, for the reason that
' several other very important cases of a
j similar character were pending before the
JrCourt of Appeals.
Judges Gilbert, Ross and Hawley opened
the session of the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals yesterday and handed
down decisions in six cases.

APPEAL COURT
OPENS SESSION
Mr. Preston, assayer for the State Min
ing Bureau, told the history of the gray
ish substance and its iridescent adorn
ments. The gray bulk was volcanic tufa.
It waa discovered In the tastnessea of the
dreary Funeral Mountains, that loom
above Death Valley, In Inyo County. The
sample forwarded to the Mining Bureau
was small. The deposit from which it
waa taken waa in ledges of large size,
deep and wide. The opals that were vis
ible to the naked eye were brought out
more distinctly with the aid of a micro
scope. There could be no question con
cerning their Identity.
Probably there arc as many opals In
the middle of the ledge as on the out-
Bide. Very likely throughout the great
ledge of volcanic tufa there may be spe
cimens much larger and valuable com
mercially. The interesting point from
the scientific attitude is that this geologi
cal formation carries such gems.
A few opals have been dscovered In
San Bernardino County and In Shasta
County. The output of Mexico Is com
mercially valuable. The specimens from
the Funeral Mountains, now under exam
ination at the State Mining Bureau, were
picked up by C. E. Showalter at Rialto,
Cal, Mr. Showalter writes that the ledge
from which they were taken Is near thÂ«i
ninety-seventh line post marking the
boundary between California and Nevada.
The ledge Js of white rock and very
Thls news may set prospectors living
In Inyo County to making some search
for opals of larger size. The region in
which they are reported is so dismal and
uncomfortable that no man voluntarily
goes there unless there is some buslnc-ss
Inducement or necessity to prompt him.
An opal Is silica, like quartz, but In a
different condition, having a lower spe
cific gravity and hardness, and being
without crystalline structure. The tufa
in which the Funeral Mountain opals have
been found is calcareous rock, rough and
cellular. From Us gray surface peer out
changeable reflections of green, blue, yel
low and red. such as may possibly indi
cate the presence of what is technically
known to lapidaries as the "noble opal.
At the State Mining Bureau there was
received yesterday a mass of grayish
Igneous matter, hard as a flint, on the
face of which, emitting the unmistakable
light that Indicates the presence of gems,
are at least half a score of opals. They
are small, but Â»!gnincant. The hope wa3
thereby raised that an opal industry may
be created In California.
Discovery Is Made That May
Lead to Exten3ive Ex
ploration.

graph operator at Selma, charged with
assault to murder, was called In Police
Judge Cabanlss' court yesterday the-
Judge, after reading a letter he had re
ceived from Dr. William W. Kergan of

ago Hubbard fired a shot at a man who
had struck him on the mouth, and tha
bullet hit Mrs. Kergan. who was standing
at Grant avenue and Market street wait
ing for a car to take her to the ferry.
Dr. Kergan In his letter said that ho
had "Carefully investigated Hubbard's
story and his past history and had comÂ©
to the conclusion that Hubbard was tell

flcdently recovered to be told the story of
the shooting, and she had absolutely re

was a rhrinkace In the dealings to about the
daily average. The price movements were
very distinctly s'.JCKish and phowed little in

closing. The bullish professionals who hal
tormed a hope that the cjnÂ»:<Je-ab!e streryfth

this to-d&y. Wall street continues to puzzle

The year's expansion In loans of tr.ore than

the same period of ever $40,000,000. is the
ground for :-â¢ :..u uneasiness over the gentral

a conclusion that tn rplte of the enormous
liquidation there is etlll much borrowed money
tied up. In the case of stocks which have
been Hired from sacrifice by response to calls

The Potato market was overstocked and easy
except for fancy Salinas Burbanks. The dally
receipts of river Burbanks are too heavy for
the market to absorb, aa there Is no outside
demand and stocks are steadily accumulating.
Four cars of Sweet Potatoes were received
from Merced and there was a sharp drop in
prices. Fancy Onions were fairly steady at
the quotations, but there were large quanti
ties of poor etock offering, which could not be
sold at any price.
Freeh arrivals of Tomatoes were rather light
as the trains from across the. bay were de

carried-over stock, which arrived late on Sat
urday. The demand was fair and the quo

obtained only for some special brands. 40c

plentiful and prices were shaded. Â»The other

CHICAGO. Oct. .">. â There was only a mod
erate amount of trading and the undertone was
of a decidedly weak nature. The news in tren
eral was extremely bearish, foreign markets,
being lower on laiger world's shipments than
had been expected and on th4 flood of Rus
sian and Danubian wheat which is being
thrown upon the European markets. These, in
fluences, along with the increased receipts in
the Northwest, caused weakness in this market
at the ptart. December opening Hi&%c to %?/>
S.C lower at 76% 1 877c The break at St. Louis
was another factor in discouraging holders, and
more particularly in discouraging any active
support of thei market. There was heavy sell
ing during the openinsr hour by St. Louis
houtes and prices gradually declined. Decem
ber selling off to 76%c before the. noon hour.
A somewhat better tone developed on a partial
recovery at St. Louis, but the liberal Increase
in the visible supply, amounting to 2,460,000
bushels, with renewed weakness in .the South
west, caused a decline and December closed
%<5!sc lower at 76%c.
Corn was weak nt the opening on favorable
weather, lower cables and the decline in
wheat. December closed %c lower at 44%c.
Oats were weak in sympathy with wheat and
corn. December closed with a loss of a ehade
at 3.1 %c.
Provisions were rjuiet and prices showed lit
tle change throughout the session. January
pork and ribs closed unchanged and January
lard was 2%c lower.
The leading futures ranged as follows:
Chicago Grain Market.
Business on the local exchanges continued
very quiet and the only fluctuation worthy of
note was an advance in Gas and Electric to
$67 in the afternoon.
Ex-dividend yesterday: The Chutes Company,
regular monthly, 5c per share, amounting try
$3000; Pacific Lighting Company, regular
monthly. ?,5c per share, amounting to $14,000;
Onomea Sugar Company, regular monthly, 40c
per share, amounting to $2O,C0O.

CASH WHEAT,
WHEAT â Liverpool and Paris futures were
both lower. The world's shipments for the
week were aÂ« follows, in quarters: Russian,
628,000; Danubian. 118.000; Argentine, 2000;
Indian. 80,000. Broomhall ! cabled that the
Liverpool market was depressed by large Rus
sian offerings.
The American visible supply Increased 2.
250.000 bushels. Chicago was quiet and %c
lower. The export demand was Insignificant.
There was a better cash demand in the North
west.
In this market futures were lower, but the
cash grain waÂ« unchanged. The feature of
the market was the clearing of a cargo for
Europe. It is the first full cargo to be clear
ed for Europe this crop year, and shows the
HfeleEsness of the export movement from this
port this year. Of course it is understood
that along In the closing weeks of the last
crop year the Wheat was not here to export.

any advance in prices. Muscat in large boxes
were in rather light receipt and cleaned up
better than the other varieties, which were
abundant. Receipts of Wine Grapes were
heavy over Sunday, and prices of the black
varieties declined sharply under a slack de
mand. There were over ten cars on the track
unsold at the end of thÂ« day. Fanoy Apples
continued to move freely, and fine Pears, too,
were In good request* at steady rates. Some

rather dull, with nearly all descriptions sell-

The situation in Cheese remains precisely as
before. Eggs are a point higher again, with
a marked falling off in the receipts of choice
ranch. The advance in fresh good* enables
holders of cold storage stock to obtain higher
prices for these goods.
Tho situation in Butter Is unsatisfactory to
the houses which are well supplied with Cali
fornia creamery. The Eastern markets are.
declining and a3 stocks of Eastern here are,
large and continually being added to by daily
arrivals and the retailers are running on the
Eastern to the neglect of the California goods,
the latter are becoming demoralized. Large
handlers see no other way to work off their
stocks than to offer their holdings down to
tho Eastern basis, and cards are accordingly
being sent out making cuts of from lc to 2o
from the quotations ruling at the close of last
week. The Elgin quotations came through lo
lower again yesterday.

LOS ANGELES. Oct. 6.â This was a
day of sacrifice by train wrecks here. In
three separate accidents on the Southern
Pacific lines five men were killed out
right, four fatally injured and more than
twenty painfully hurt. The dead:
MARTIN SAYRES, laborer, aged 65,
San Francisco: skull and body crushed.
JAMES McCONNELL, laborer, 45, Los
Angeles; head crushed.
UNIDENTIFIED WORKMAN, 60, Los
Angeles; nearly every bone broken.
HENRY VOGT, 20, legs and arms
cut off.
CHARLES JOHNSON, laborer; crushed
under locomotive.
The fatally injured are: George Evans,
laborer, 29, Leadville, Colo., Internal
organs ruptured; Jose Vasques, 21, fore
head crushed in; Oscar Lucas, 30, San
Franciaco, buggy painter. Internally in
jured, was stealing a ride; C. T. Travel
llan, Cleveland, Tenn., Internally hurt.
On the Chatsworth cut-oft a work
train crashed into two cars loaded with
steel rails standing on the main line and
there three were killed. In the canyon
above Saugus on the valley division an
oil train left the track and Vogt was
killed and Lucas fatally Injured. The
track was torn up and trains were delayed
many hours. At Port Los Angeles a
switch engine ran upon C. Johnson. All
the accidents occurred within three hours.
The Chatsworth cut-off horror was most
peculiar. A hundred workmen were hud
dled on top of a pile of heavy tools aboard
a flat car, which was at the head of a
long construction train. The train flew
at giddy speed upon the loaded steel cars
and the men made frantic signals to the
engineer to stop, but failed to catch his
eye. The poor creatures rushed up and
down, warning and screaming, and finally
stampeded madly to the end of the- car to
get as far as possible .from the point of
collision.
The sudden crash shot them off their
feet as from a catapult. Some went high
in the air and one man flew fully eighty
feet. Upon them came the load of heavy
tools and construction material, crowbars,
picks, shovels, spikes, ties and angle bars,
which fell like hail upon the unfortunates.
Some of the victims were actually gouged
in mid-air by the flying missiles, while
others were battered to death on the
ground.
Though the men and debris were scat
tered over an acre, by strange coinci
dence all the deaths occurred in one lit
tle heao of scraps about four feet high.
It was as if the wreck killed, buried and
erected a monument to its victims at one
fell stroke.
At the bottom of this mound lay Mar-

tin Sayres, the pioneer railroad builder of
them, all, who had worked as a camp
boss throughout the whole* West for
thirty years.
All the dead were brought here and
twenty Injured are in the Sisters' Hos
pital. Engineer Milton Nicholson and
Conductor L. Burns were in charge of the
train and the survivors are unanimous In
placfng the blame for the disaster c*i
Nicholson. The officials refuse to make a
statement.
Major Ducat openly complimented Col
onel Thomas F. O'Neil and the officers of
the regiment upon the discipline of the
command and its general knowledge of
camp and field dutfl Major Ducat's re
port was made direct to the Secretary of
War.
Colonel "Wilhelm's report was also com
plimentary to the regiment. In the courso
of his report he says:
The g^iard duty waa well performed, except.
In a few Instances by the recrulta. â¢ â¢ â¢
The- discipline of the re*lnv â .t was good; the
men were Very respectful ai... well behaved, as
well as neat in their appearance, both in and
out of camp, an evidence of material not found
In every regiment.
The colonel and many of the officers and
men of the regiment have had valuable experi
ence In the Government military Â»ervicÂ« dar
ing the recent war with Bpain. â¢â¢â¢>Â»!â¢
rank and rile no better men can be found to
make up the enlisted strength of a regiment
than those of the First Infantry- As a rule
they are quiet, respectful, obedient and with
out complaint; they surely had soznÂ« cause for
the latter during the trying inspection, lasting
from S o'clock in the morning until 12 o'clock
noon, on the open field in the oppressive heat
of the 27th day of June last at the camp la
Santa Rosa.
General Bisbee, U. S. A. (retired), was
present at the Inspection by Colonel Wll
helm and. the guardsmen say, was loud
in bis praises of the regiment's discipline
and knowledge.
Tha report of Colonel Koster. Division
Jnspector X. O. C. criticizing what, ho
terms lack of discipline and want of
knowledge of duty on the part of tha
National Guardsmen, has aroused the Irs
of the officers and members of the First
Infantry Regiment.
ThÂ«y oar that a few weeks after tha
Inspection by Colonel Koster, at which
he formed his opinion, the regiment was
thoroughly inspected by Colonel Thomas
"Wllhelm. U. S. A., detailed by the War
Department to Inspect the guard of the
State, and by Major A. C. Ducat, Seventh
Infantry, IT. S. A., specially detailed for
inspection duty by General Arthur Mac-
Arthur. U. S. A., pursuant to orders .from
the Secretary of War; and these officers,
it Is said, reported most favorably upon
the discipline, instruction and knowledge
of both officers and men of the Guard.

Entire Market Street System Is Tied
Up by Accident at Power
House.
Residents of the city who are in the
habit of patronizing the cable lines of the
United Railroads in their dally travels
were forced to a full appreciation of the
convenience j of that system . yesterday
afternoon.
Shortly before 6 o'clock. Just at one of
the busiest times of the day, the cars
stoppe'd moving. It was soon learned
that a shaft, used to hold in place the
pulleys through which the cablfe is con
ducted in and out of the power-house at
Valencia and Market streets, had broken
and that traffic would be discontinued for
many hours.
Late last evening It was announced by
the railroad officials that the cars would
be running again this morning. .

The final trial of the night was between
the plasterers and the bricklayers and
proved a most stubborn match. From
the sound of Referee Sullivan's pistol the
bricklayers bent to their work with a vim
and before their opponents could get to
gether grained a cleat on them. For more
than fourteen minutes the indicator was
at a standstill, when suddenly the plas
terers, with mighty effort, backed up and
pulled their opponents over the line

In the other contests the carpenters de
feated the carmen in twenty seconds the
teamsters outpulled the bridge workers In
forty-five seconds and the longshore lum
bermen, after a stubborn trial that lasted
rnore than two and a half minutes
dragged the team of laborers over the
line. The electrical engineers defaulted to

that it was handicapped without him.

Fischer's.
"The^ Paraders" broke the record for
successes at Fischer's Theater last night.
The little playhouse has never been more
crowded, and never has one of its audi
ences been more liberal with its applause.
After the first act a couple of wagon
loads of floral pieces and bouquets went
over the footlights, and the stage had the
appearance of a conservatory. Then every
one made a speech, including Charles
Jones, the stage director, and Raymond
W. Peck and Robert Hood, the authors
of book and music, respectively.
The songs are all new and the tunes to
most of them will soon be whistled on the
street. "My Alameda Rose," sung by
Miss Amber, scored the biggest hit of
them all last night. The audience seemed
Â¦to want to keep the throat-weary young
lady singing until daylight, but the cur
tain finally put a stop to it.
The musical comedy Is an agreeable
change from the burlesque, which has
had so long a run at Fischer's. The new
style of entertainment furnishes opportu
nities for all the stars to cast forth as
much radiance as before, and there are
just as many humorous sayings and com
ical absurdities as ever.
The scene is laid at Coronado Beach
and the characters are summer girls and
sailors from the California training ship
Mohican.
The- chorus has made a great stride for
ward from a vocal standpoint. Its mem
bers execute a difficult drill very cleverly.
Bernard played the part of a bad man
from Texas, and was never funnier. Kolb
and Dill worked together. They held to
their linguistic gymnastics and horseplay,
but " did plenty of laughter-provoking
stunts besides. Winifred Blake and
Maude Amber never appeared to better
advantage. The latter, incidentally, had
some exceptionally stunning: gowns. Ger
tie Emerson and Flossie Hope had some
new and bewildering dances. Harry
Hermsen and Eleanor Jenkins sang hu
morous songs, which were greatly appre
ciated. .
The costumes are rich and appropriate.
The stage settings, particularly that rer>I
resenting the deck of the man-of-war,
are unusually fine. The music Is all ex
cellent and the singers do it justice.
Chutes.
Fischer and "Wacker, the comic Tyro
lean duetists, and Larkins and Patterson,
the clever colored couple, are the head
liners at the Chutes this week, and they
pleased large audiences afternoon and
evening yesterday. Louie Dacre, the "fun
ny lady," sang new parodies and made
fun of herself In a way that brought
down the house, the Grierson sisters
changed their songs and dances and Ex
cella, the pretty contortionist, continued
to tie herself in knots. May Lamson, the
popular contralto, in illustrated songs
and the animatoscope with new and amusl
ing moving pictures completed the pro
gramme. The amateurs will appear on
Thursday night.
Columbia.
The audience at the Columbia last night
did not commence to enthuse over the
production of "Florodora" until the double
sextet began the familiar strains of "Tell
Me, Pretty Maiden," and the singers
earned three encores for a clever rendition
of the ditty, which does not seem to have
lost any -of its power to please by fre
quent repetition. The ladies aro decidedly
handsome and possessed of graceful car
riage, and with their six beaux as an off
set made a pleasing: picture.
Isadore Rush as Lady Holyrood Is eas
ily the star of the piece and possesses a
style that is not only dainty, but chic as
well. Her singing of "Tact" was one of
the best things on the programme, and
her dancing accompaniment was prettily
done. Miss Rush has a smile that puts
one in good humor in spite of oneself.
Joseph Phillips as Frank Abercoed dis
plays a fine voice In the song "Under the
Shade of the Palms" and plays what
there is of the part with intelligence. R.
E Graham is unctuously amusing as Cy
rus W. Gilfaln, and Is at all times con
scientious and painstaking. His little ex
hibition of yodellng at the conclusion of
the "Florodora" sextet recalled the days
some two decades ago when Graham used
to shine In that particular line. Philip
Ryley Is all that could be desired as An
thony Tweedlepunch, and his exhibition
of phrenology in the first act and of a
drunken man In the second created no end
of merriment. Donald Brine did not have
much to do as Captain Arthur Donegal,
but his singing of "I Want to Be a Mil
itary Man," aided as it was with a large
and efficient chorus, was no small feature
of the evening's entertainment. In fact,
the chorus work throughout was eminent
ly satisfactory. The girls, and there are
many of them, are pTetty in the main,
and Greta Rlsley makes a stunning ap
pearance upon her entrance in the 1 second
act. For one who is not too exacting
"Florodora" is something to be enjoyed,
with its pretty stage pictures and its
handsomely gowned women.
The Central Theater seems to have
capped the climax of its successes with the
L. R. Stockwell series of comedies. "My
Friend From India," Du Souchefs great
est of laugh-provokers, was the new bill
last night, and the packed house laughed
and applauded and gave enthusiastic evi
dence of its delight in curtain calls for
the star and his clever fellow players.
There is not a dull moment In "My Friend
From India," and the sallies of humor
and flashes of wit are enough to banish
the most serious case of the blues. The
performance is a genuine treat, a banquet
of health-aiding amusement, and Stock
well la the bright particular luminary
that radiates fun as the sun does heat
and light. In the role of A. Keene Shaver,
Stockwell Is a circus and several side
shows rolled into one. The part of the

Testimonial to Erwin
The California Camera Club has ar
ranged for this evening an elaborate en

served the organization in that capacity
for nearly five years. The programme,
which promises td be exceptionally in
teresting, will Include vocal and instru
mental music, moving pictures and stere

nied by a descriptive lecture by Presi

OPENS FALL TERM WITH
INTERESTING PROGRAMME
When Casey was asked why Nerio's sa
loon had been ordered demolished and the
obstructing platform of the Union Lum
ber Company had been untouched he said-
I gave orders for all these obstruc
tions to be removed, and the men started
in with Nerio's ealoon. â¢ The platform of
the lumber company will be pulled down
later on. It does not matter if the Super
visors did not pass any resolution regard
ing these obstructions on Hooper street
or if no special complaint was made. For
that matter, I can make a complaint."
Casey was asked if there was any truth
In a statement that the Union Lumber
Company desired to get Nerio's saloon
out of the way and then ask the Super
visors to declare Hooper street closed to
traffic, so that the company could use
the entire street for its business.
"That is the first I have heard of It,"
replied Casey. "We propose to remove all
obstructions on streets in that vicinity as
there is a lot of. traffic there. The board
has acted, in a perfectly legal manner in
this matter, and Nerio was given every
chance to state his case before the board
and remove his building."
CASEY MAKES STATEMENT.
The records of the Board of Supervisors
show that no one has ever filed a com
plaint concerning any obstructions on
Hooper Btreet. When the officials of the
Board of Public Works were confronted
with this fact they replied that the board
had a perfect right to declare Nerio's
building an obstruction and to remove it
from the street.
It was admitted by Michael Casey of
the Works Board that the lumber com
pany had refused to remove the platform,
claiming that Nerio's saloon was also an
obstruction, and - that until Nerio com
plied with the law the lumber company
would not act.
the Board of Public Works was disclosed
yesterday by an investigation of the evic
tion proceedings. It was claimed by the
secretary of the Works Board that Nerio
had been served with notice to vacate
pursuant to a resolution passed by the Su
pervisors, which body acted on a petition
by Magee & Son.
Documents were displayed by the of
ficials of the Board of Public Works
showing that Nerio, together with the
Union Lumber Company, had been served
with notices to vacate and remove ob
structions on Hooper street. The lumber
company had a large unloading platform
in the rear of Nerio's saloon, and the
platform is built over the street.

the life of the policeman, and his wife
and one of her sons are accused- of ob
structing the squad and disturbing the
peace.
The affair was â¢witnessed by a large
crowd of men employed In the. lumber
yards in the vicinity of the saloon and
excitement ran high for a time. Nerio
was arrested on a charge of threats
against life and his wife and John La
gomarsino, his stepson, were arrested
for disturbing the peace. The arrested
persons were taken to the City Pris-r.,
the woman being accompanied by one of
her young children. Mrs. Nerio and her
son, Lagomarslno, were released on $10
bail each, while Nerio was detained in the
prison awaiting bondsmen.
TBOUBLE OF LONG STANDING
The trouble between Nerio and the city
authorities is of long standing. Mrs.
Nerio's- first husband built the property
in dispute some 30 years ago, long
before Hooper street was dedicated to
public use.
The building was owned by the present
wife of Nerio when he was married and
for 22 years --ie couple have run a saloon
in the place. Attempts. to oust them have
repeatedly failed. Six years ago Nerio
was twice arrested for obstmictins: the
streets, but he was acquitted in the Police
Court. - '
Some of the streets In the vicinity of
Nerio's saloon are similarly obstructed.
Many of the lumber companies in that
district have been in the habit of piling
lumber on the streets and some of them
have erected stables sheds and unloading
platforms on the public highways.
Magee & Son, the real estate dealers,
filed a petition with the Board of .Super
visors in February, L02, and in April, 1903.
complaining of a saloon obstructing' the
corner of Sixth and Irwin streets, which
is a block away from Hooper street. ,'
J. end A. Frlppo, who kept . the saloon
In Question, removed their building, but
Nerio claimed that he was legally entitled
to remain In his premises at Sixth and
Hooper streets, having lived there a long
time before Hooper street was dedicated.
Nerio secured an attorney to appear be
fore the Board of Public Works, and the
matter dragged along for many months.
Finally Michael Casey, president of the"
Board of Public Works, ordered that Ne
rio's building be removed, and It was this
order that led to the trouble of yesterday
morning.

There was consternation for a moment
and then all present, including Howell,
burst into hearty laughter. Cabaniss
was full of apologies to the Commissioner,
assuring him that he was unaware of the
fact that the cigar was loaded, and Fritz
had to get out of the difficulty as grace
fully as he could. He said, however, that
it would be a long time before he kept
a loaded cigar in his desk again.
Howell laughingly said. "Well, I will
try it, anyway." He lighted it and as
Fritz returned from the telephone and
approached Howell. who had the cigar in
his mouth, there was a loud report and
the cigar ppread out like a duster and
then unrolled like a bunch of currency.
Police Commissioner Howell was the
accidental victim of a practical joke yes
terday afternoon, but he took it good
naturedly, although his dignity was for
the moment somewhat ruffled. He was
handed a loaded cigar, and when it ex
ploded his face was a study.
The Commissioner called upon Police
Judge Fritz in his chambers after court
had adjourned. Judge Cabaniss happened
to be there and two of Judge Frltz"s
friends. One of the Judge's friends had
given him a loaded cigar some time be
fore, and while the Judge was called to
the telephone for a minute the friend took
the cigar out of a drawer in the Judge'*
desk and handed it to Judge Cabaniss.
At that moment Commissioner Howell
entered the chambers, and Judge Caban
iss, not knowing the nature of the cigar,
handed it to Howell with the remark.
"This Is one of Fritz's cigars, and I can't
vouch for it."

PROVES A NOISY ONE
Two letters addressed to his wife were
found on a table near the body. One
makes reference to the fact that his rent
was up yesterday and he had packed her
belongings In a trunk. The letter con
cludes with. "God bless and protect you
Is the wish of your loving and heart
broken hupband, Tom." The other letter
relates the story of her departure from
the house and his subsequent search of
Oakland to locate her. He mentions his
penniless condition and states that he
eto!e some money to take him across the
bay In search of his wife. Reference is
made to several telephone calls which he
failed to receive and believed were from
his wife. The letter breathes love and af
fection aiSl indicates that brooding over
the disappearance of his wife was pri
marily responsible for the rash deed.
Deceased was 42 years of age and a na
tive of Washington. D. C. The present
whereabouts of Mrs. Fisher is not
known, but it is presumed that fhe is lo
cated in some interior town. The dead
xnan was a member of Morse Lodge No.
257, I. O. O. F.. of this city.
The discovery of the tragedy was made
by M. Anders, a roomer In the house, who
found the deceased lying on the foor, fully
dressed. A tumbler on the washstand
that had contained carbolic acid bore
Elleut testimony to the cause of death.
The Coroner's office was notified and the
body removed to the Morgue.
Fisher, accompanied by his wife, arrived
in this city from Fruitvale four months
ago and took up his residence at TOS^
L&rkln street. He secured employment
with" the New York Life Insurance Com
pany in the capacity of a solicitor. Two
weeks ago. according to the landlady, he
and his wife quarreled and the disagree
ment culminated in the woman leaving
her husband. Since that time Fisher had
been very despondent and last evening
went to a saloon at b Mason street, where
he attempted to crate a bottle containing
carbolic acid, but was prevented by the
alertness of M. C. King, the bartender.
He no doubt went from the saloon to his
rooms and there accomplished his self
destruction without the fear of molesta
tion.
Heartbroken over the fact that his wife
had left hlra. distracted by his subsequent
Inability to ascertain her whereabouts
and despondent by reason of his pennl
lees condition, Thomas W. Fisher, an In
surance solicitor, ended his life shortly
after 7 o'clock last evening In his rooms
&t TCSVs Larkin street by swallowing a
quantity of carbolic acid. A pack of play-
Ing cards scattered on a table seemed to
Indicate that he spent his last moments
on earth playing a game of solitaire to
decide his fate.
Agostinl, star of the first "Boheme"
given here, still shines undlmmed. He
seems to be slnginz even better than
usual, and was last night treated to a
stormy welcome to that effect. He is
by much the best Rudolfo of my acquaint
ance, voiced tenderly and without a trace
of a bleat, splendidly equal too to the
vocal climaxes; and with a manly and
poetic appreciation of the character.
Agostlni does nothing better than this, if
anything so well.
The Mlmi was new. The little Duchess
ina de Spada made her debut in the role,
and sang and smiled har way into the
heart of an audience already very favor
ably inclined to the little lady. There is
more coquetry^ and less poetry in her con
ception than in Montanari's, whose little
Parisian grisette is her best work. And.
too, measured against Agostini's smooth,
virile voice, De Spada's hardly balanced
in the climaxes. But, well used as this
soprano's voice always is. It Is rounding
out, and will soon be equal to the vocal
exactions of the role. She : sang very
charmingly, very tastefully, however, and
gave a thoroughly pleasing performance.
Miss de Spada Is happy in looking the
part very prettily.
Of the immortal quartet Zanini was tne
Marcel, and a very good one. One has
noted before the salutary effect of this
role on the barytone, and Zanini shows
himself very sensible of it. He Is vocally
adequate and a good fourth In the fun
going. Zani Is the Schaunard. the musi
cian, and, like a good many other musi
cians with the tail of his eye glued to
the beat. Take it off, Mr. Zani, and your
Schaunard, with his round rumble and a
bass, is quite happy. Dado's "Farewell
Song to the Coat" was one of the gems
of the evening., and his Colline altogether
handsome. The dancing scene shows
Mr. Dado tripping a heavier fantastic toe
than last year.
' Miss Tromben's Musette was another
novelty of the cast, the dainty morsel of
a soprano a very pretty picture, and a
chic and piquant Aiusette so far as the
acting goes. Her voice was, however, not
heavy enough to balance those of the
other singers. Cortesi was doubly useful
as Benoit and Alcindoro.
As before said the chorus was very
good, but the orchestra needed the soft
pedal badly in places, the first act par
ticularly. Its last act was, however,
carefully and f.nely shaded and the work
throughout spirited. To-night "Otello"
goes with Gregoretti as Iago.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Those curious to hear the first bad per
formance of " j-ia Boheme" at the Tivoll
would better stay away this week. Since
the opera's putting on two seasons ago
at the little opera shop I have been wait
ing for it, but it hasn't arrived yet. From
Agostinl to the humorous lass who does
the Sis Hopkins of the crowd in front of
the Cafe Momus, every member of the
cast simply basks in the opera. They
would rather sing it than eat, and it
Bounds that way. Nor wonderful Is this.
"La Boheme," with Its human, pitiful.
Joyful little crowd of folk one has rubbed
elbows with, offers a chance to get down
from the stilts of the older opera. Its
people come in out of the rain, and other
wise act like humans. The chorus escapes
the deadly semicircle, the principals the
three gestures of conventional opera. It
is only to be natural and the opera goes,
and they do know how at the Tlvoli.
Every time one sees the opera they
have added or changed some effective
bit of detail In the "business," even down
to the chorus, that the management sen
sibly leaves here to Its own devices. Not
in the Grau. edition of the opera was
there the fun, color, point that the Tiv
oli gets into the Cafe Momus scene, for
exampleâ though the young woman who
wandered In last night from 1903 in a
shirt waist might be expurgated. But the
scene was full of life and color, as was,
and always Is, the Tivoli "La Boheme."
Neither must Its difficulty be underrated.
The quick dramatic movement of the
piece doubles its vocal difficulties, and
the handling of a moving chorus like that
of the aforesaid scene Is a herculean task.
But the chorus sang, and loved, and
Jested in excellent time last night to Mr.
SteindornTs beat, and -added much also
to the picture with its quaint costumes.
Hoffman put all the blame upon his wife
for their quarrels, saying that now his
fortune had gone glimmering his wife
wanted to get rid of him. He promised
the Judge that he would not have any
thing further to do with her. and on that
understanding the Judge continued the
case till Saturday to see if he kept his
promise.
Buddhlstlcal barber gives him plenty of
opportunity for those farcical side plays
that never fall to set the house in a roar,
while the lines themselves are the essence
of humorous absurdity. Stockwell as "the
light of Asia," robed In an omelette-col
ored bed spread. Is the most laugh-com
pelling spectacle imaginable. Herschel
Mayall, with his usual ability, portrays
the leading juvenile role of the son in an
ocean of trouble, who seeks to escape the
wrath of his sire by working off the bar
ber as his "friend from India." Henry
Shumer proves himself as good a heavy
comedian as he can be a heavy villain,
and Is enjoyable as the western pork
packer determined to get his daughters
into the New York smart set. Eugenie
Thais Lawton was a delightful Marion
Hayste, and Genevieve Kane and Myrtle
Vane were good as the candidates for
Vanity Fair. Marie Howe has a comical
maiden aunt part, and Georgle Wood
thorpe makes the most of her chances aa
a German, servant girl. Ernest Howell
and Edwin T. Emery serve up minor
parts acceptably, and the whole cast
works in a praiseworthy manner. "My
Friend From India" Is one of the very
best comedies- of Its kind, and It 13 a win
ner this week at the Central.
ThÂ© preliminary examination of Charles
Hoffman, a confectioner, living at SS Her
mann street, on a charge of assault with
a deadly weapon, before Police Judge
Fritz yesterday brought out the fact that
he is another victim of the matrimonial
bureau marriages. He was accused of
throwing a champagne bottle at his wife
on the night of September 29.
Mrs. Hoffman, who is a professional
nurse, testified that she had told her hus
band that morning that either he or she
would have to leave the house. When she
got home at night from attending a sick
woman her husband held the bottle over
her head and threatened to knock out
her brains. As she was running to the
door he threw the bottle at her, but It
etruck the wall.
On cross-examination Mrs. Hoffman ad
mitted that she was conducting a matri
monial bureau in Germany twelve years
ago, when Hoffman applied to her for a
wife. She told him the supply of pretty
maidens was exhausted, but that she her
self was ready and willing to become his
bride. They were married and came to
this country, and had been separated
three times, owing, she alleged, to his
cruel treatment. Last Christmas day he
had cut her with a knife, and she showed
the scar on her forehead. She admitted
that he had a small fortune when they
were married, but she added that she also
had a small fortune.
Earnings per year, $200,000; operating ex
penses for same car service as at present,
$122,000; maintenance, deterioration, etc.,
$30,000; profit 54S.OO0.
Philip B. Anspacher let off a number of
Jokes as frisky as a bundle of flre crack
ers on July 4. He said he was on a car
and fell into a lady's lap. The lady asked
him whether he was a "Highlander or a
Laplander." He rejoined that he thought
he was "a laplander." He then recounted
how a 2olt of a car caused him to swal
low a nickel which he had in his mouth
at the moment the conductor asked for
his fare. When taken to the doctor, the
skillful practitioner made him "cough up
five dollars." He continued by picturing
an ideal road which would be constructed
should the city control the railroad. He
also considered that such control would
be the means of purifying politics.
James H. Barry spoke In favor of the
city owning the road, and was followed
by Frank Sullivan, who was of the same
opinion.
While speaking In glowing terms of cit
ies of Europe owning their street cars, a
voice from the back of the theater called
out, "Yes, they own them, and they don't
give you cushions, either."
After Sullivan's speech, which was
noted for its witticism, there was a rush
for the doors, and the combined pleading
of Secretary Troy and Chairman Clinton
for the audience to remain to hear Grun
sky's letter had no effect on those who
were leaving the theater. They went, and
left a handful to hear the contents* of the
epistle. Grunsky placed his opinion as
follows: â¢ Â¦ N
ANSPACHEB'S JOKES.
Sweigert began his address on the ad
visability of the city acquiring the
Geary-street road by announcing that
"his voice was in a sling." He got it un
tangled, however, which gave him the op
portunity to say that "Mr. Cornelius had
telegraphed his good wishes to the Car
men's Union and Mr. Platt had also re
ceived a telegram containing good wishes
from his associates." Sweigert then an
nounced to his hearers that they were
going to turn the cars on the Geary-street
road over to the Landmarks League
branch at Carvllle. He characterized the
Geary-street line as a chartered member
of the "associated villainies."
William Goldkuhl. vice president of the
Carmen's Union, spoke in favor of munici
pal ownership of the road and he had no
doubt that such a course would be
benefit to the city. He appealed to the
common sense of the people and asked
whether capitalists would desire to re
main in possession of the road unless it
was a paying concern. By the city hav
ing control of the road the pay of the
men on the cars would be increased, he
said, and their hours would be less than
they were now.
G. B. Benham, president of the Labor
Council, read a lengthy speech. Speaking
of municipal ownership he said that
through the establishment and extension
of publicly owned utilities "the buying
of Supervisors will pass away." "Honor,"
he said, "will be where knavery has
been." Benham said further that capi
tal removed from activity in these semi
public utilities seeks new enterprises
apart from the monopolization of streets
and in order to gain new enterprises for
itself, enters Into new fields and also de
velops new industries capable of employ
ing the people and bringing remuneration
for the Investment.
Troy apologized for the absence of
Gutte, and introduced Dr. C. A. Clinton,
who had conssnted to preside.
The doctor was in the midst of remarks
which plainly showed that his inclina
tion was toward the city owning and
conducting the Geary-street Railroad,
when the band of eight pieces was heard
outside, but approaching nearer and near
er and at last it entered the theater
ahead of about eighty carmen from the
Carmen's Union, led by William Gold
kuhl, vice president of the union.
Dr. Clinton, resuming his address, de
nounced corporations as being arrogant,
evilly so, and giving poor service. By
owning public utilities he said there would
be no strikes of employes, for, he said,
under municipal ownership such a condi
tion could not exist, for the men would
be well paid and their hours would meet
with their approbation. The doctor felt
that these corporations were monstrous
evils. He spoke of public servants being
willing tools of corporations, forgetful
of honor and of manhood. They were
Judases who betrayed their city and
branded their souls. He considered such
men should be "snowed" under when
again seeking office. He asked what
remedy there was for "the deplorable
state of affairs in our city?" "The solu
tion is to be found," he said "In public
ownership."
Dr. Clinton's address was received with
meager applause from the small audience.
The chairman then introduced Charles
Sweigert.
SWEIGERT UNTANGLES VOICE
CLINTON THE
RÂ«d flashes and huge bonfires, whose
sparks floated on the gentle autumn night
air -without the Alhambra Theater, to
gether with the efforts of a band of eight
pieces, failed to attract the people of San
Francisco to a mass meeting which had
been announced to be held last night for
the purpose of giving support, coun
tenance and an Impetus to the adopting
of the Geary-street Railroad bonds.
There was woeful disappointment all
around, for I. Gutte, the announced chair
man, became Indisposed and sent a letter
with his regrets, but expressing sympa
thy with the object of the gathering.
C. E. Grunsky. the City Engineer, who
had been invited to attend, came to the
theater at 8:05. The house was almost
empty and Grunsky after looking around
left a note for the chairman with his Idea
of probable profits and expenses should
the city take over the road, and he then
took a hasty departure from the building.
And still the band played at the steps
of the almost vacant playhouse, and Sec
retary Troy, anxious and energetic, has
tened to the small crowd of little boys
who guarded the red flre to ascertain
whether it was necessary to replenish the
conspicuous blaze.
Instead of 8 o'clock, it was threa=quar
ters of an hour later before there was
anything like an assemblage of even small
size to address.
