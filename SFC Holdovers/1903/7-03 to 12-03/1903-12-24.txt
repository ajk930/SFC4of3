LOS ANGELES, Dec. 23. â James C.

inost famous educator in California,
had a narrow escape from death at
his own hands to-night and only es
capf-d by the prompt administration
at th~ proper remedies. He is more
than SO years of age. very deaf and
almost blind. He has been suffering
from bronchitis for some time and
yns taking eucalyptus oil to secure
relief. In the semi darkness of his
room to-night hf got hold of a bottle
containing a solution of carbolig acfd
and took I a dope sufficient to have
killed him had the acid not been di

mouth and throat and he rushed to
the bearest'jdrac i;tore. where alcohol
t. as administered. Then he was tak

further treatment was Riven him. The
physicians think he will recover.
Polton is a forty-niner and first

JAMES C. PEXTOX TAKES
CARBOLIC ACID BY MISTAKE
The result of- the test shows that, in
ease of, trouble with boats under water,
the crews could find an exit in this
manner and -that the danger of injury
would be , very . small.
NEWPORT. R. I., Dec. 23.â An im
portant test was made with one of the
submarine torpedo-boats a few days
ago, which sets at rest'ths idea that it
would be impossible for the crew of. a
submarine boat to escape if anything
were to happen to the boat while sub
merged. It was suggested that the
men could escape through the torpedo
tube at the bow of the boat, but many
naval officers thought this could not be
accomplished without Injury. It was
finally decided to have a test in this line
and two . large dogs were secured ' as
subjects.
The Holland boat Shark, attached to
the torpedo statjon, was selected for the
test;' and, "under the command of Lieu
tenant C. T. Nelson, went out into the
bay. After the craft was submerged,
one of the dogs was placed fn the tor
pedo tube, a wooden wad placed behind
the animal and the whole expelled in
the same manner as a torpedo. Many
thought that the force of the com
pressed-air charge wouU kill the ani
mal, but it came to the surface and
swam ashore as if nothing had oc
curred. The other dog was then ex
perimented upon and it 'likewise came
to the surface uninjured.

PEKING, Dec. -'3.â The optimistic
feeling in some quarters concerning war
between Japan and Russia is not
shared by the. other diplomats at Pe
king, whose knowledge of the present
situation entitles their opinion to the
highest consideration. It is positively
known that the Japanese Government
has drawn the line for a settlement,
beyond wfiich it will not make any ma
terial concessions, and that it is deter
mined to fight before yielding what it
considers to be Japan's vital interests.
It is believed that unless Russia con
cedes important points, another ex
change of notes will precipitate the
crisis.
It is also believed that Japan will
refuse any arrangement holding in
abeyance the question of the evacua
tion of Manchuria, which was one of
the terms of the proposed arrangement
recently announced from St. Peters
burg and which, it Is now supposed,
was intended by the Russian Govern
ment as a "feeler." This would be' a
violation of express pledges given to
Japan and China. Minister Uchlda is
reported Â¦ to have said he would be
obliged to resign his post in the event
of such an agreement.
The most dangerous factor in the
situation is the confidence of the Rus
sian officials in the Far East that a
war would mean an easy victory for
Russia and the challenging tone of the
Russian officials and newspapers.
The intelligent Chinese officials await
developments with the deepest anxiety.
They foresee the many perils menac
ing China in the event of war and the
possibilities that a partition of the em
pire may result from China's inability
to maintain the neutrality of her har
bors and subjects.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 23.â Rear Ad
miral Walker to-day informed the Pres
ident that in his opinion it would be ex
pedient to leave to the marines the pro
tection of the republic of Panama, and
that it was unnecessary to increase the
force of marines already in Panama or
in isthmian waters. Regarding the
health of the marines, Rear Admiral
Walker told the President tljat it could
j scarcely be better. He said that while
the marines were welcomed and their
presence was realized to be for the best
interests of the republic, the sending
of regular troops might cause a feeling
of uneasiness.
Despite the peaceful report made by
Rear Admiral Walker, the probability
is that two more battalions of marines
â¢will sail next week on the Dixie from
I Philadelphia for Colon. It is felt at the
Navy Department that it will be well
to have a sufficient force in isthmian
' waters to permit of frequent reliefs for
the force ashore. Between now and
Monday the question will be decided
definitely.
The official announcement is made
that General Elliott," commandant of
the marine corps, will go to the Isth
mus, as the administration wishes him
to make a thorough inspection of con
ditions there, both from a military and
a sanitary standpoint- The Dixie will
carry a number of rapid-fire guns.
Commanding the two battalions will- be
Lieutenant Colonel William P. Blddlc
and Lieutenant Colonel L. W. Walter.
Among the other officers selected to go
are Captain C. S. Radford as chief
quartermaster. Captain H. L. Matthews
end Captain E. K. Cole. General El-
Hott will be accompanied by his two
aids. Captain Frank E. Evans and Cap
tain Harry Leonard. It is expected the
Dixie will sail from Philadelphia on
Monday. -.,...
A long cablegram was prepared for
Rear Admiral Glass to-day under the
personal supervision of Secretary
Moody. It was largely one of inquiry
as to conditions on the isthmus and
the probable . need for more marines.
On Rear Admiral Glass' reply witl de

the two additional battalions.
"You are hereby instructed to accept

points in the .republic of Panama, and

lie of Panama, through its Minister,
Bunau-Varilla, has filed its first pro
test against the action of a United
States official affecting matters pertain
ing to that republic. In a long dis
patch to the Minister the Panaman
Consul at San Francisco, Feraud, has
notified him that the postal authorities
of that city had refused to accept reg
istered mail or parcel post addressed
to the republic of Panama. The Con
sul states that these authorities insist
.on mail being addressed "Republic of
Colombia."
The Consul refused to comply and
referred the Â¦ matter to the Minister,
who promptly laid it before Acting Sec
retary of State Loomis. The latter at
once notified the Postmaster General,
asking him to take such steps as would
rectify the action of the San Francisco
authorities.
The Postmaster General, upon receipt
of the "communication from the State
Department, sent the following tele
gram to the Postmaster at San Fran

NEW YORK. Dec. 23.â The Hamburg-
American liner Bluecher docked to-day
after the most exciting voyage in the
history of ocean ' going steamships.
During midnight. of the first day out
from Hamburg, while she was running
in a dense fog at only half speed, with
foghorns blowing, she was run into,

and a big hole was stove in her bows.
The forward compartment was flooded

The ill luck did not end here, how

The leading financiers know nothing
of any Russian overtures to float a
loan of $125,000,000 in Germany, and
the report to that effect, published by
the Tageblatt in a dispatch from St.
Petersburg is regarded as unfounded.
Sir Frank Lascelles. the British Erny
bassador, who returned here from Ens
land three days asi>, is understood to
have imparted his impression unof
ficially to the German Government
that the British Cabinet apprehended
that war would result if Russia per
sisted in her present attitude toward
Japan. This expression of opinion by
the Embassador was stripped of all
suggestion that Great Britain might
participate, but great significance is
attributed to it.
BERLIN, Dec. 23.â The German For
eign Office, in estimating the probabil
ities of war in the Far East, fixes its
attention at this moment on Great Brit
ain rather than on Japan, for it is rec
ognized that Japan is only waiting for
Great Britain to give the word before
beginning hostilities. A new ami even
portentous element In the situation, aa
It is looked upon here, is the rising feel
ins In. Great Britain that Rus3<a mu*t
yield or Japan and Great Britain ought
to licht ner.
From the highest diplomatic source
it is learned that the German Govern
ment, while refusing to believe that
war is certain, is convinced now that,
if war between Russia and Japan
comes. Great Britain will take a part
in it, because the British Government
looks upon war as possibly the only
means of savins and re-establishing
her position in the East.

CA.USE OFTHE DISASTER.
The moment the cars stopped rolling
there was a wild scene. Many persons
were pinned beneath the wreckage and
screams and cries rent the air. Many
of the injured, in their mad panic,
plunged into the river. Others, pin
ioned beneath the heavy timbers,
pleaded in agonized tones for release.
So terrific was the force of the collision
that nearly every passenger suffered
a moment's unconsciousness, and many
of the able-bodied men were unable to
assist in helping the injured from the
wreck because of having fainted.
The killed ' were mostly foreigners
who were in the smoking car, just back
of the baggage car. They were literally
roasted to... "death, the baggage and
smoker telescoping the engine and im
mediately catching fire. Many of their
bodies are lying burned to a crisp in
the baggage-room of the Baltimore and
Ohio depot, to be removed later to the
undertaking shops in the city.
A peculiar feature of the accident was
the fact that not a woman was seri
ously injured.
Suddenly the engine swerved to the
left and the coaches plunged down
over the embankment to the edge of
the Youghiogheny River.
I'lXMCD UXDER WRECKAGE.
The train was made up of. two bag
gage cars, two day coaches, one sleeper
and one dining car. and at the time
was carrying at the lowest estimate
lÂ£0 passengers. The train plowed along
for a considerable distance and the
cars were torn to pieces, passengers
jumping, screaming or falling from the j
wreck as it tore along. â¢
The train left Pittsburgthis evening,
running h few minutes late, in charge
of Engineer William Thornley of Con
nellsvillp. When approaching Laurel
Run. over a particularly fine piece of
roadbed, the train was running at high
speed. Suddenly the passengers were
thrown from their seats by the light
ning-like application of the air brakes
and a moment later there was a terrific
crash.

General Barrett is a Democrat and
Charles Rice a Republican, but political
affiliations are hardly ever considered
in Grand,, Army contests for leadership.
It Is noted, however, with more regret
than surprise, that ItX popular elections
both parties turn down the veteran sol
dier.
Politicians take enough Interest In
Grand Army affairs to note where the
honors of leadership are bestowed 'in a
Presidential year. General John C.
Black, thjÂ£ national commander, is a
prominent Democratic statesman. Gen
eral Barrett has not yet attained prom
inence as a statesman, but he has an
excellent record as a soldier in time of
war and an office-holder m time of
peace.
It Is remarked in Grand Army circles
that General Shafter has displayed en
ergy and ability as a department com
mander. He has visited many of the
posts throughout the State and will
visit many others before his term of of
fice expires.
Grand Army men living north of the
Tehachapi range are receiving many
letters from Southern California in
which the candidacy of Charles Rice
of Riverside for department command-'
er, to succeed General Shafter. is com
mended. The encampment will be held
in Los Angeles next April. General A.
W. Barrett, formerly of Los Angeles
but now a resident of San Francisco,
will be supported for commander by
many delegations. It is common talk
in Grand Army posts of Northern and
Central California that the south is en
titled to the honors this year, but it is
added that the comrades dwelling south
of Tehachapi cannot win with two can
didates in the field. Success, will read
ily follow a union of forces In favor of
one aspirant.
General Barrett Is an old-time South
'ern Callfornlan. He was a resident of
Los Angeles when Governor Budd ap
pointed him to the office of adjutant
general. As Bank Commissioner his
appointment was accredited to the
south. He has quite a large personal
acquaintance in Los Angeles, and his
friends there continue to regard him as
a citizen of that city. , f

rey County mystery has been solved.
About twelve months ago an eccentric
old German, John G. Kloughman, ,who
is also known as John Klarman and
as "Dutch John," suddenly disappeared
from his cabin near the Los burros
mines, where he had been at work. As
several weeks of strict search failed
to reveal his whereabouts, it was
thought that he had been crossed in
something and had walked to Soledad
and taken a train for other parts. He*
was almost forgotten, when yesterday
afternoon William Crinkshank, while
out hunting, noticed some clothing in
the bushes just off the t trail near
Klc-ughman's cabin and proceeded to
make an investigation. To his horror
he discovered the bones and clothing
of a man and through the latter iden
tified the remains as those of "Dutch
John." The bones were strewn around
as though the body had been torn by
vultures and beasts of prey. â¢

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 23.â Ascot Park,
Los Angeles' new racetrack, is con

,the management not to employ mem
oers of a labor union exclusively in
any department. of the place.
Employment in the park is closed to
union men, according to a committee
which was appointed to interview the
racing association officials with a view
to obtaining consent for union waiters
to work in the restaurants that will be
part of the new resort. The committee
says it was informed by the Ascot man
agement that instructions had been
given not to hire. members of any labor
organization. Whether or not other un
ions will be drawn into the matter has
not been determined.
Secretary Lemuel Biddle of the Coun
cil of Labor says the subject is sched

meeting to be held this evening. He
had not learned to-day w ; hat the report
of the grievance committee appointed
for the purpose of interviewing the

MAY BOYCOTT ASCOT PARK.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â The Secre
tary of the Interior to-day refused the
application of the city of San Francisco
for permission to begin the necessary
construction toward obtaining a water"
supply from the^ Yosemlte National
Park. *
The city proposed to expend about
$39,000,000 on the waterworks, and had
a hearing before the Secretary of the
Interior some months ago, at which au
thority to take the preliminary steps,
so far as they applfed to the park, was
asked.
The Interior Department's adverse ac
tion is based on the fact that the organ
ic act creating the park requires the
government to keep it in its natural
condition.
It was pointed out tliat the law un
der which the application was filed
could grant' only a temporary privi
lege which would be revocable at the
will of any future head of the depart
ment. The city wished to build a dam
at the end of Hetch Hetchy Valley and
convert that valley into a reservoir.
It was also proposed to dam up the
end of Lake Elenor. The department
holds that such works would obliterate
or deface the natural wonders of the
park.
Special Dispatch to The Call
PHILADELPHIA. Dec. 23.â Judge
Kirkpatrick's order for the levy of a
$24,000,000 assessment upon stockholders
of the American Asphalt Company
threatens several capitalists of this and
other rities with financial annihilation.
The decree opens way for suits that
Biay mulct three men â George W. El
kins,, George Crocker and William J.
Lattaâ in no less a sum than $4,000,000.
It is certain that Elkins and Crocker
eould survive this blow and still have
a few millions on which to live, but
with William J. Latta the disaster
would be complete. Although promi
nent as a successful promoter, Latta,
according to repute, is not a rich man,
and the decreed assessment of $40 up
on each of his 3000 shares in the de
funct asphalt trust foots up a total
that menaces him with ruin.
F. A. B. Widener and his son,
George M., are among the hardest hit
of the original asphalt group. ! The
father stands to lose $2,000,000 and the
son $1,500,000.
Whether or not these suits in recov
ery can be successfully prosecuted re
mains to be determined. Receiver Tat
hall is certain that they can, while the
menaced millionaires say that they will
nght to the last ditch.
George W. Elkins, George Crocker
and William J. Latta have a special
grievance. They claim to have sur
rendered cash to the amount of $2,500,
000 and stock worth $1,000,000 to the
F.iddle-Cuyler Asphalt Company and to
have received nothing in return. It
was taken as an act of restitution and
It is alleged that Elkins, Crocker and
Latta were guaranteed against fur

Assistant Attorney General Campbell
Gives Important Opinion Con
cerning Reclamation. *
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â Assistant
'Attorney General Campbell of the In
terior Department has rendpred an
opinion to Secretary Hitchcock sustain
ing the latter in refusing to approve
the segregation of between 40i\000 and
600,000 acres of arid lands in Idaho,
which it was proposed to reeiaim. The
Commissioner of the General Land Of
fice had held that in view of an act
of tho Idaho Legislature of llarch 18,
1901, no further contracts between the
State and the United States could be
entered into so long as the State law
was in force.
This law provides that when a com
pany improved tracts of land by the
building of extensive irrigation canals
and within two years had not found
the necessary settlers for each 160 acres
of land, the lands should be deeded to
the companies making the improve
ments. This was said to be contrary
to the Federal laws. Under the decision

before the Interior Department at the
expiration of the two-year clause for
settlement of the lands.
capacity arid all of the passengers were
cooked alive. Not a single passenger
in this car escaped and it is estimated
that at least forty of the dead were in
the smoker.
Baggagemaster Thomas J. Baum of
Hazelwood, who was on the wrecked
train, proved himself a hero. With hls ( .
head and body frightfully cut, he man
aged to crawl* from the wreckage .and*
groping his way in the darkness) flag-"'
ged the west-bound passenger train No.
49. He had nothing with which to sig
nal the train except matches, and
these he made use of in his despera
tion, taking off his coat and setting
fire to it. He stopped the train just :
in time to prevent it plunging into the;
wreck and adding further horror to an;
already indescribable disaster.
COLLAPSES ON THE RAILS.
Baum collapsed when he saw he had
succeeded in stopping the train and
when the engine stopped he was lying
within a few feet of it. i"
An operator at "VR" tower on the
Pittsburg and Lake Erie Railroad,
across the Youghiogheny" River, was
the first to send word of the accident
and to send for relief. He was watch
ing the limited as it was speeding
across the river. He saw. the cars pile
high in the air and then sink back on
the tracks. . The screams of the injure^
and dying were plainly^ heard. Jn an
other second he was sending word to
the railroad* officials at Daweoh and
Connellsville. .'
For more than 500 feet both the east
and west bound tracks are torn up.
The engine was completely demolished
and the big 7000-gallon tank on the ten
der was thrown 100 feet ahead from
the wreckage. The baggage car was
thrown into the river, but was only
slightly wrecked.. All of the cars were
derailed and the trucks of all excep^
the diner were, torn completely from*
underneath the cars. Few persons were
seriously injured in the Pullman cars
and the diner, although few escaped ;
without at least some slight injuries. \
SURGEONS HURRY TO SCENE.
As soon as the wreck was reported
in Connellsville all the available physi
cians, were summoned^ including Balti
more and Ohio surgeons, and a special
train was made up and taken in charge
by General Superintendent Sims and
Superintendent Irwin of the Pittsburg
division. The relief train was run at
full speed and t}ie scene of the wreck
was reached at 9 o'clock. The injured
were looked after immediately and
every one was made as comfortable as
possible. They were loaded upon the
relief train and taken to the Cottage
State Hospital here. The dead were
placed in a long row on the embank
ment opposite the wreckage,, and in a
single line thirty-eight forms lay on the
frozen ground" Another row on the op
posite side of the wreckage contained
eleven, and scattered here and there
through the., underbrush were the bod
ies of many who had been able to crawl
from the wreckage but died before aid
reached them.
Under his engine lay Engineer Wil
liam Thornley, mangled almost beyond
recognition. It was impossible at the
time to extricate his body, and it will
be several hours before the wrecking
crew will be able to remove the engine
which pinions him' under Its huge mass
of steel.
Hardly had the bodies of the dead
been removed from the coaches before
thieves began robbing the dead of jew
elry and money. Special officers were
deputized, and with the aid of the Bal
timore and Ohio police force and Con
nellsville officers the work of the ghouls
was stopped. Several persons are under
suspicion and arrests will occur, to
morrow.
One man, after rushing into the
woods, came back again, went Into the
baggage car of the relief train and, sit
ting down, said, "My God!" The next
instant he dropped over dead without
another word. There was not a scar
on him. He had inhaled the steam.

HARRISBURG, Pa., , Dec. 23.âHaz
ards of railroad . life are sharply em
phasized In the annual report-.of I. B.
Brown, secretary of the Department of
the Internal Affairs, in which a parallel
is drawn between the casualties among
railroad employes in this State during
the last year and the Union losses on
some of the great battlefields of the
Civil War. The casualties among steam
railway employes in Pennsylvania for
the year covered by the report were 15,
382. The combined figures for steam and
street railways' show a greater number
of casualties during the year than oc
curred to the Union army in any one of
the great battles of the Civil War.
During the year the number of pas
sengers killed was 41 and injured 1727;
of the employes of the street railway
corporations 21 were killed and 252 in
jured; of other persons 185 were killed
and 1090 Injured, making the total num
ber of fatal accidents on the lines of
these corporations 227 and the total
number of non-fatal 3059.
In discussing the casualties figures
reported by the various roads, Secre
tary Hrown calls attention to "the sig
nificant fact that there was a decrease
in the number of employes injured last

The Princess, who is a daughter of
Don Carlos, the Spanish Pretender,
was reported some time ago to have
eloped with her coachman, but this
was denied from several sources, and
she began divorce proceedings against
Prince Frederick on the ground of
bodily injury and forcible deprivation
of her liberty. The Prince and Prin
cess were married by the present Pope
while he was Patriarch of Venice, and
the Prince and the Princess expect
that the Pontiff will agree to the dis
solution of the marriage.

REMEMBERED
The theater was brilliantly lighted
and rich in gold and artistic decora
tions. Crowded as it was last even
ing, the spectator who gazed upon the
scene of life and color from the top
balcony was carried av.ay by the spec
tacle! The side boxes surrounding the
orchestra, and opening directly into
the foyer, were filled with beautiful
women. In all parts of the house the
fair sex added brilliance to the scene.
It was like a first night of the Grau
grand opera season. Many of the fair
sex were attired in evening costumes
and their escorts were in full dress.
Between acts first nightcs crowded
the cafe and lounging places and dis
cussed the house. Little was said
about the extravaganza, every one
seeming to be ready to say something
nice about the interior furnishings, dec
orations and commodiousness of the
house. Many said the new playhouse
had come in the nick ot time and oth
ers expressed themselves as being de
lighted that this city now ha? a cen
trally located theater that can be
pointed out as an ideal place for the
drama, burlesque or oueral
The audience began to arrive early.
Before 8 o'clock the theater vÂ»-as com
fortably filled and by the time the cur
tain arose for the first act there was
not a seat vacant. Hundreds stood in
the back of the house to watch the
performance and to gaze upon the au
dience- Many came early and went
from floor to floor to examlns :he place.
The view from the top balcony Is a
splendid one and those who filled it last
evening saw the performance from a
point of vantage. The big theater was
nicely heated and the ventilation was
excellent.
"What a glorious place for the Grau
opera season." could be heard on
every side, and this was the highest
tribute that could be paid, for the
grand opera season is after all the one
event in the lives of the music-loving
people of San Francisco.
BRILLIANT SPECTACLE.
The new Tivoli was opened to the
public last night. A more auspicious
opening could not have been desired
by the management. From pit to
dome the handsome playhouse was
crowded by an appreciative audience.
It was a critical gathering, and withal
a charitable one. It overlooked delays
and condoned incidents that brought
discomfort. Instead of complaints and
criticisms the management heard
praise. Kind words were showered on
those interested In the temple of music,
and the praise was deserved. There
is not a handsomer playhouse in this
city, or west of the Rockies. It. is
modern in every particular, and, what
is most important, its acoustics are re
markably good. Every word uttered
by those on the stage, every note of
the catchy music sung or played by
the orchestra could he heard in all
parts of the house. The seats are
roomy, the aisles wide, the seating ar
rangements highly satisfactory.
The opening of the new playhouse
marked an epoch in the annals of the
stage in San Francisco. The bf.st peo
ple in this $lty attended the opening
performance' and admire^ the beauti
ful interior.
/'The musical fame of San Francisco
has been maintained on many an occa
sion by the Tivoli management. Once,
I remeinber very Â¦well, and I am sure
you all remember. It; I allude to the
time we were visited by that great
composer, Pietro Mascagni. (Applause*.)
Coming here as he did from Eastern
cities of the United States, that did not
accord him the treatment he should
"Don't be alarmed, ladies and gen
tlemen, I am not going to sing. (Laugh
ter.) I have been asked by the man
agement this evening to say a /ew
words for It and on behalf of the city
of San Francisco on this occasion, the
formal opening and dedication of the
new Tlvoll. San Francisco, as probably
you all know, is known all over the
United States as the greatest musical
city on this continent; not because it
has a musical Mayor (laughter), or, as
some of my opponents in the last cam
paign called me, 'a fiddling Mayor,' but
because the people of San Francisco
know what is and appreciate the best
In musical art. (Applause.)
"This great outpouring to-night is
not only composed of the best citizens
of San Francisco, but is composed of
the music loving: people of the city, j
those who love art for art's sake. The
Tivoli Opera-house in the last -thirty
years has done much to educate the
people in the art of music.
MUSICAL. FAME OF CITY. j
The llsror took his cue, and when
the greeting he received had subsided
spoke as follows:
Ferris Hartman. attired in a box
overcoat and posing as a man of let
ters, strode on the stage after the cur
tain had fallen on the first act. He was
followed by Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz,
who was on the management's pro
gramme to deliver a speech. The Mayor
did not know this until after he had
taken his seat in his box, and the sum
mons to appear behind .the scenes was
as sudden as it was unexpected.
"I wish to introduce," Hartman start
ed out to say. but the applause over
took him and he rhymed his short
speech by exclaiming, "Oh, what's the
use!"
Manager William H. Lejtliy was busy
the entire evening looking after the
comforts of the patrons of the house.
MAYOR SCHMTTZ SPEAKS.
Unlike the old Tivoli the house was
free from tobacco smoke. This inno
vation was greatly appreciated by the
ladies. The true bohemian who likes
to sit and blow rings in the air while
listening to the music of his favorite
opera had to seek the cafe or the
lounging-room on the top floor to
smoke.
An elevator that will carry ten peo
ple without danger of breaking down
or stalling between floors is .1 pleasing
feature of the house. Many availed
themselves of the opportunity to ascend
to the second balcony by modern meth
ods. When the performance was over
there was no crowding. The stairways
are wide and the audience was able
to descend without crushing.
Conductor Paul StcindoriT and his
orchestra received a tvarin welcome
when they took their seats before the
opcrJng of the performance?. Many
handsome floral pieces were s*nt to the
leading peotÂ»!Â» in the cast. Â¦
DRESDEN. Dec. 23.â The court has
dissolved the marriage of Prince Fred
erick and Princess Alice of Shoenburg-
Waldenburg. The court simply an
noilnced the decree of divorce without
"explanation of the reasons. The pro

have received, San Francisco opened
her arms and honored him and the
Tivoli management did much to make
the great artist feel that he was at
home and among people whose hearts
beat as warmly as those at his native
land. (Applause.)
"In passing to-night I feel it a duty
to say a word for the orchestra of the
Tivdli Opera-house (applause), that we
in San Francisco have always looked
to as the best of its kind in our city.
We have, had at the head of piafc or
chestra men of world-wide reputation,
but, ladies and. gentlemen. I say to
night that we have never had a more
capable cr conscientious man at the
head of it than we have now in the per
son of Paul Steindorff. (Applause.)
"Now this great temple dedicated to
song belongs to you. It is true that
it will be managed by the Tivoli Com
pany, but it belongs to you and through
your patronage and by the giving or
withholding of it you can. compel the
management to rater to your wishes
and to give you the best. Let us hope
that this outpouring to-night is only
a sample of what will continue, and
let us hope that those who love art
for art's sake will, by their patronage,
show their appreciation of the manage
ment of this place, that has done so
much in the past for music. Ladies and
gentlemen, I thank you." (Applause.)
At the time the first bids were open
ed the suspicion prevailed that a ring
had been formed for the purpose of
forcing the Commissioners i to pay an
excessive price for the work, but if
this suspicion was shared by the
board it did not make known the fact,
although its rejection of the bids
strengthened the ganeral supposition
that it was inclined to take that view
of the matter. At -all events, it -was
satisfied that the bids were excessive
und this conclusion was fu!ly con
firmed when Gray Bros, yesterday

The Board of Harbor Commission

the bid of that firm it clearly vindi
cated its members in their recent re
fusal to act upon previous bid? for
the same work. Â£ome weeks ago the
board opened a number of bids, the
lowest of which was SI 11.100. As this
bid exceeded by a large figure the esti
mate of the harbor *>r.gineer, the Com
rr.iÂ«ior.er?. after a careful considera
tion of the matter, finally rejected all
of them and advertised again on the

The prettiest theater in town opened
last night, its name the new Tivoli.
There wasn't a thing to remind of tbe
farrous old house across ths way only
Frederick McGreer's fine drop curtain.
The cheerfulâ and kipperedâ scarlet
and green of it has given way to a
delicate pistache and goia, the crook
kr.ee chairs to luxurious eeats, the
small stage to the Becond largest In
town, and the queer old auditorium to
one of the finest in America. For the
must of thirty years* beer and smoke
there is the smell of fresh paint, for
the crush of the tiny old foyer the
spaciousness of fine promenades. There
are perhaps half a dozen seats In the
house from which the sta^e may not
be fully seen; there are none where
everything may not be admirably
heard. Acoustically the new theater
is as fine as the Gr,eek Theater in
Berkeley. Ferris Hartman even looms
up as something within shouting dis
tance cf a barytone. Can more be said?
Everybody -was there, three thousand
of them, comfortably crowded into the
new theater. The play was not the
thing last cfghtâ rather luckily for
* Ixion." It was the theater. It was
the opening night of a house that from
its heredity should make history of the
noblest for our city. And nobody
missed it who was able to get in.
Musicians, theater managers and the
great army o' music lovers were out
:n force, with the Mayor at the head.
It was r.or wholly the fault of "Ixion"
that the spectacle fell somewhat fiat.
The occasion was felt to be grand op
eratic. The audience was a grand-op
rra audience, and Mayor Schmitz's
speech pitched in grand-opera key.
And -'Ixlcn" is only a Christmas ex
travaganza and net one of the best in
its present shape that the Tivoli people
have given.
And now one wishes again to the new
house that it may be a worthy descend
ant of the o!d.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
In a day or two. when the piece be
gins to go more aulcklyâ j t goes now
very smoothlyâ ard Mr. Hartman in
jects a few gags and jokÂ»s, -Ixion"
will doubtless be much funnier. But it
Is as pretty ass it can be now.
But the ballets are the chief attrac
tion of the piece. They are excellently
planned and prettily executed. One,
the -Wines of California," in which
children and young girls clothed in
wine colors dance round a May pole, is
particularly pretty. The -Early Days
of California" is another very success
ful one. It is both elaborate and orig
inal. The lighting effects also are par
ticularly good and the scenery excel
lent.
decided that the old Tivoli comic opera
company was about as good as there
was going.
The additions, however, are valuable.
Anna Lichter is an old favorite and
looking prettier than ever, and Schus
ter's big basso will be handsomely use
ful when he gets something to do with
it. Bessie Tannehill is also favorably
known here for her work with the
Dunne & Ryley company, and Wallace
Brownlow, the new barytone, shows a
good voice, handsome presence and the
ease of experience.
Mr. Stelndorff drew first blood in the
applause. The popular conductor was
warmly cheered as he took up the
baton. Then Annie Myers, -who Is the
Ixion of the cast, came In for a hearty
round. Annie is the same plump and
piquant person as of yore, but even
this' gingery little soubrette cannot do
much with Ixion. Then followed Hart
man, who also hasn't enough to do with
the case, to the tune of a warm wel
come. Each in turn was bo greeted; In
fact, the audience clapped whenever it
had a chance.
Webb has the tingle opportunity of
the piece, and is ravishingly funny as
Minerva, in a blade psyche knot, and
breastplate. He drew the first laugh
and most of tbe rest, and certainly
makes the most of his material. He
has some good songs; one particularly,
"Oh. Be Careful," was hilariously en
cored. Arthur Cunningham has an
other good song. "When Jupiter Leads
His Own Brigade." He is in fine form
and set the heels stamping to his spirit
ed song. Wallace Brownlow Is cast as
Apollo and has no great chance to show
his mettle. He has a pleasant, rather
light barytone, and as before said, the
manner of an accomplished actor â also,
a penchant for stepping upon trains.
Anna Lichter's one song was one of the
bright spots of the evening. She is cast
as Junoâ though it makes no â¢ differ
ence. Others of the cast are Eunice
Gliman. a clever small girl; Aimee Lei
cester. Flora Norris. Nettie Deglow and
a tiny premiere danseuse. Baby Agnes
Russell.

SALEM, Or.. Dec. 23. â The extraor
dinary session of the State Legislature,
called primarily to enact remedial
laws to the tax laps, which in thfir
present state fail to provide for levy-
Ing and collecting any taxes for the
ensuing year, came to an end just be
fore midnight to-night, after re-enact
ing the old tax law, appropriating
$100,000 to purchase a right of way
for the Government's ship canal
around The Dalles of the Columbia
River and passing a number of bills
of minor importance. Many of thÂ«
members of the House have left for
their homes and to-morrow will see
the last of them depart. A bill to
place the Governor and other S^ate
officials on a flat salary was pas3ed
by the House to-night, but when it
came to the Senate it went down to
defeat. An act designed to regulate
railroad transportation and traffic,
principally to compel railroads in
Oregon'to furnish cars for movement
of freight, with a penalty of $10 for
each day"s delay after cars are order
ed, -was killed in the House. The anti
gambling bill, a radical measure pro
viding extreme penalties for violation,
which passed the House this afternoon
by a bare majority, failed when it
came before the Senate.

Councilman B.H. Pendleton expressed
the hope that the matter of a public
playground for the young people of
West Oakland would be taken up and
carried forward by every resident and
property owner in that portion of the
city. He said: N .; ; . Â¦Â¦ .
Every question has two Bides and It ia al
ways well to consider both. The city owna
nearly ten acres of land situated between
Eighteenth and Twentieth atreets'on Peralta,
and at present this land is useless to the city
and an eyesore to the resident* of this section.
This might be- filled In and sold or leased and
the city derive an Income from its holding, or
It can be improved and turned into a recreation
park and .playground for children. In my
opinion the greatest benefit would be derived
from the playground. At present the boys of
the High School have to go out to Emeryville
to practice baseball and football. We all know
what the surroundings are there and It Is
doubtful if wo would care to have our brothers
and aonn thrown into close contact with such
associations. Why not provide a park for Just
?uch purposes as thin, where the pupils of the
public . schools may come for their games and
sperts? s .. . . Â¦ . . â¢
However, this improvement will not be car
ried through unless the people of . West Oak
land with it, . The Council will not force nor
foist anything upon them â¢ and the matter rests
Wallace Alexander, president, of the
Aloha Club, opened the meeting this
evening with a brief address, stating
the object of the gathering. He said:
"The proposition of establishing a
recreation park and children's play
ground on this piece of marsh land
owned by the city is not a new one,
but although it has been talked about
for a number of years by the people
of West Oakland up to the present time
ho definite action of any kind has been
taken. The members of this club have
resolved to make an attempt to bring
about a realization of the project and
if we are successful we feel sure that
not only will the young pe6ple of this
section of the city be directly bene
fited, but that the property owners in
this vicinity will find that the improve
ment of what is at present a piece of
worthless swamp land will materially
increase the value of their property."
Mr. Peixotto, who is at the head of
the Columbia Park Boys' Club in San
Francisco, gave an interesting account
of the establishing of public play
grounds for children in many of the
large cities in the EÂ£st and in San
Francisco. After explaining the system
of management of some of the largest
of these playgrounds he said:
"If the expense of improving the en
tire property is too great for the city to
assume at one time, it could be done a
section at a time as the money was
forthcoming. Of course, it would take
longer, but if rightly managed the re
sult would be the same in the end."
LAND NOW USELESS.
STATES PROPOSITION.
The suggestion of Mr. Pendleton that
a mass-meeting of the property owners
of West Oakland be called to consider
the proposition of presenting a. petition
to the City Council asking that body
to take! some action in the matter was
finally adopted, and as soon as possible
after the holidays a meeting will be
called, at which Colonel John P. Irish
and other prominent residents of the
western portion of the city will be
asked to speak. The question will be
thoroughly discussed and such action
as is approved by the majority of the
taxpayers of West Oakland will be
taken. .
OAKLAND, Dec. 23.â The Aloha Club
of West Oakland, which is a social set
tlement organization backed by a num
ber of philanthropic people of this city,
has undertaken the laudable labor of
turning the ten acres of unimproved
land in West Oakland owned by the
city into a recreation and play ground
for the youth of the western end of
the city. The matter was discussed this
evening at a meeting of the members
of the club, at which Wallace Alex
ander, its president, Councilman Ben
jamin H. Pendleton, Sidney L. Peixotto
of San Francisco, William Walsh and
a number of others expressed their
views on the subject and suggested
various plans for carrying on the work
begun by the club.
At the close of Councilman Pendle-
Jon's address William Walsh, one of the
oldest supporters of the club and a
well-known resident of West Oakland,
spoke briefly in favor of the proposed
playground. He said in part:
"The people of West Oakland are not
in the habit of talking very much. We
pay our taxes regularly and attend to
our own business. I think, however,
that in consideration of the fact that
there Is not a single park in this part
of the city which is maintained at pub
lic expense we should interest ourselves
in this park, and when the residents of
this part of Oakland are ready to take
the matter up they will find that I am
ready to do all that lies in my power
to bring the matter to a successful is
sue."
AVEST' OAKLANDER SPEAKS.
entirely with themselves. The Southern Pa
cific will soon lmr>ro\> Its depot at Sixteenth
street and If this Improvement Is carried
through this section of West Oakland w:K be
a spot of beauty instead of an area of waste,
unprofitable land. Such a course would add
much to the value of property in this part of
the city.
If this proposition Is carried to a successful
end I would recommend that the park be put
In the hands of a commission of representative
citizens of West Oakland and I am sure that
if this Is done every dollar appropriated for
the playground will be wisely expended.

OAKLAND, Dec. 23. â The Western
Union Telegraph Company began suit
against Alameda County to-day to re
cover $133 96 taxes it paid, upon it3
franchise, which it alleges was illeg-al
ly assessed by County Assessor Dal
ton.
The company makes .the contention
that its franchise is a Federal fran
chise; that it transmits messages for
the Government at a rate fixed by the
Postmaster General and that these
messages have tire right of way over
all other matter. It contends that it
is thus exempt from taxation so far
as its franchise is concerned. Dalton
made a departure this year and as
sessed what had never been assessed
before.

ALAMEDA, Dec. 23.â Principal John
W. Young, who has been cennected
with the school department for fifteen
years, has filed his rrs:gnation with
the Board of Education and left for
Carpenteria, Santa Barbara County,
where he will engage in horticulture.
His retirement from local educational
work comes as a surprise to his many
friends and the School Directors, as he
had not intimated that he intended to
leave Alameda.
Principal Young explains that his re
moval from this city is made necessary
because of the ill health of his wife,
who has been advised to seeK a climate
that will be more agreeable to her.
Principal Young is the owner of a large
walnut prchard near Carpenter5a and
will henceforth devote a!i of his time
to improving the property.
For many years Principal Young was
in charge of the Porter School. When
the high school was located temporarily
in the Porter School building he was
transferred to the principalship of the
Haight School, from which position he
now retires. He was regarded as an
able instructor by trfe Board of Educa
tion and was popular with students.
No successor to Principal Young has
yet been selected.
The Pacific Incinerating Company's
new plan to establish its garbage cre
matory on tha West Oakland marsh,
west side of Wood street, between
Twenty-second and Twenty-third,
was recommended for acceptance
at a meeting to-night of the Ordi
nance and Judiciary Committee of the
City Council. A proposed lease of the
plant to the city and an ordinance to
cover the rates to be charged and regu
lating garbage collections were also
recommended. Under the lease as
amended to-night the city will receive
$750 a year and an option of purchase
at the end of ten years. Attorney Eells
of San Francisco, representing the In
cinerating company, said:
"The company has invested to date
$37,000. It is estimated that $30,000 will
be expended in moving the plant from
Twenty-sixth and Magnolia streets to
the new location. Of this amount $2000
or $3000 is for the site, $10,000 for a
foundation and the remainder for re
construction."
Under the ordinance the average
householder will pay 33 cents a month
for the removal of a ten-gallon can of
garbage weekly. The rates generally
are the same as recommended under
the first ordinance, which was indorsed
by the Merchants' Exchange and the

But the student can thank his lucky
stars that the drill was not increased
to three times a week instead of two,
as was suggested in the council meet
ing this morning. Only the voices of
some professors, who protested against
such an action, prevented tlte adoption
of such a rule, although the sugges
tion is likely to come up again.
The reason given for the change of
hours is that the 11 o'clock drill inter
feres too much with the lecture pe
riods.
The Academic Council of the Univer
sity of California to-day decided to
change the drill for the university cadet
regiment from 11 o'clock in the morn
ing to 4 o'clock in- the afternoon. This
will be unwelcome news to the stu
dents who have to drill, and desertions
and mutinies are expected to occur
when the new term opens. To most.pf
the students 11 o'clock drill or any
drill is looked upon as a monstrous
imposition, but 4 o'clock drill will be
nothing less to them than a degrading
serfdom. The 4 o'clock drill will come
when every student will already have
done a hard day's work, in his estima
tion, and rob him of the pleasure he
used to count on for the rest of the
day. It will be hard on the man who
gets through at 2 or 3 o'clock, but still
must linger around until 4 o'clock and
then strut along in soldiers' clothes for
another hour, finally winding up on the
way home at 5 o'clock. It will be still
harder on the football squad next year,
because practice begins at 4 o'clock.

It appears from a memorandum sub
mitted to the Secretary of War by Gen
eral Young, chief of staff, that the de
tail system Is a failure so far as ap
plied to the ordnance department and
the signal corps of the army. It is said
to be almost Impossible to obtain offi
cers for those branches under the pres
ent, method of selection. In the ord
nance department there are nineteen
vacancies and but little hope of filling
them. Vacancies in the signal corps
have been partly provided for by ar
bitrary detail from the line of officers
graduated this year from the general

"I asked what possible inducement
there could be to forfeit his life for

NEW YORK. Dec. 23.â Following the
announcement in London a few days
ago that an EngliFh experimenter had
found that his vacuum tube emitted
light for days after it had been discon
nected from his battery, W. J- Ham
mer, an electrical engineering expert of
this city, declared to-night that he had
obtained sounds from a vacuum tube in
the same way. After disconnecting it
he laid it down on a pasteboard box
ri'lcd with excelsior, in which It was to
be sent to a factory. Suddenly he heard
a low note in the room and traced it. to
the discarded tube. He called his wife
to hear the sound and both timed the
duration of tlu; murmur.
After five minutes had elapsed Ham
mer reconnected the tube with his in
duction coil and reheated the perforated
disk for a period of twenty 'seconds.
Then he disconnected It and laid it on
the board. This time the disk had re
sponded to the heat more readily, or
for some other reason kept up the sound
fifteen minutes. He said to-night:
"Evidently the unusual conditions in
the damaged X-ray tube made it pe
culiarly sensitive to sound waves in the
surrounding ether. .Mme. Currie ob
served the same sort of. phenomena in
connection with experiments with ra
diumânot that it gave forth heat and
light Indefinitely without loss of bulk or
weight spectroscopieally, for that con
tradicted all ideas of the conservation
of energy, but that the light waves In
the ether stimulated the radium so that
the radium gave forth Its wonderful lu
minosity." /

BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 23.â The three
story brick buildins at the corner of
Nineteenth street and Chestnut avenue
owned by George Hopkins of San Fran
cisco was to-nisht destroyed by a fire
of unknown origin. As a result from
$10,000 to $15,000 worth of property was
destroyed and 'John Ramirez, a volun
teer fireman, lies in a dying condition
at the County Hospital.
The fire started in the third story,
which had just been furnished as a
lodging-house, and it had gained con
siderable headway before an alarm was
given. The firemen soon had four
streams playing on the blaze and the
first and second floors were saved from
destruction, but are badly damaged by
water. It is impossible as yet to form
an accurate estimate of the loss on the
building, but the furniture, valued at
several thousand dollars, was com
pletely destroyed. The loss is partly
covered by insurance.
A hose line was being run from the
roof of an adjoining building, and it
was while handling this that Ramirez
met with an accident. In the dark he
stumbled on the skylight and fell
through to the iloor beneath. His head
v.as badly crushed and he was removed
to a hospital in an unconscious condi
tion. A physician who examined him
stated there is not the slightest hope of
his recovery.

Th*; address of Cardinal Oreglia was

LADROXFS LOOT AND MAI3I
In common with other diplomats in
London, Baron Hayashi shares the be
lief that Russia's reply i3 not likely to
be decisive.
A dispatch to the Reuter Telegram
Company from Tokio says:
"Incessant activity prevails at mili
tary headquarters. The transport and
other arrangements are complete. The
Government is calmly awaiting the
Russian reply, which, it is hoped, will
be" forthcoming without delay. Pre3s
dispatches from Korea report continued
disturbances at Mokpho and the out
break of a Tong Haik insurrection in
Chol-La-To province. The Tong Haiks
are a party of malcontents, whose act
ivity was the immediate cause of the
war between China and Japan. These
reports create uneasiness."
Baron 'Hayashi, the Japanese Minis
ter here, in an Interview said:
"Nothing has actually been arrived
at between Great Britain and Japan
regarding the course of action that
will be pursued in the event of a Rus
so-Japanese war beyond the stipula
tions of the Anglo-Japanese treaty."
The Minister, while admitting some
such arrangement for the support of
Japan by Great Britain, fails to see
how Japan's demands can be modified.
"I am getting very pessimistic re
garding the e%'entual outcome," he said,
'"but 1 do not expect the question of
peace or war to be settled until after
the new year. If the dispute can only
be settled, by war, the present delay,
of course, is greatly to Russia's ad
vantage."
LONDON. Dec. 23.â The British For
eign Office declined to discuss the state
ments made in dispatches from Berlin
to-day. At the German and other em
bassies the impression prevailed, not,
however, based on any official infor
mation from the Eritish- Government,
that the Russian-Japanese negotiations
have reached such a point that it would
not be at all surprising if Great Brit
ain expressed her willingness, provid
ing Japan agrees to accept certain spe
cific compromises, to guarantee to back
up Japan, if necessary, by force of
alrns.

'Â¦ given the vice presfdency of the Board
of Commerce. The president of this
important board is Prince Tsal Chen,
a youth, whose only qualification for
the position is the fact that he took a
hurried trip around the world when he
: represented China at the coronation of
| King Edward. Yet he vetoes most of
the practical proposals made by the
other members of the board.
Th,e greatest discouragement prevails

'These laws are calculated to materially
' cripple the borrowing capacity of the
railway companies and to restrict the

security holders. The regulations fur

foreigners to a maximum of 50 per cent,

j three years has represented the Brit
! ish Government in Peking, sees only a
j faint prospect of war being averted.
Minister Satow was connected- with
the British diplomatic service in Japan
fcr a quarter of a century. He is one
| of the greatest living authorities on
j Japanese history ard literature and Is
in constant communication with the
i foremost statesmen of Japan. He is
; quoted as saying that any one who
imagines that Japan will not fight for
' v.hat she conceives to be her greatest
1 interests does not know the Jap'anese
: people.
Sir Richard Hart, director of the Chl

to-day that he feared China would be

Kerr was sent to the Emergency Hos

bullet by means of the X-ray and sub
sequently extracted the leaden missile.
Kerr would not talk of the shooting,
and when pressed he -claimed that it
was an accident. Phemister was in a
drunken stupor when seen in his cell
at the Southern station, and he denied
shooting Kerr, who, he said, was an
old friend.

A delegation of police sergeants
waited on Mayor Schmltz yesterday
to urge himno use his influence to in
duce the Civil Service Commission to
hold the examination for promotion
from sergeant to lieutenant immedi
ately. The commission h.aa a rule
that an eligible must be six months
in his position before he can take an
other examination and this will pre
vent the newly appointed sergeants
from taking the examination if it is
held before six months have passed.
The old sergeants told the Mayor they
thought it unfair to bring the new
men in competition with them for
further promotion. The Mayor, while
inclined to the opinion that the new
men should have a chance, promised
to take the matter up. with the com
mission. It is more than likely that
another examination will be held be
fore the expiration of six months.
There is no eligible list of lieuten
ants arid as there are at least two
prospective vacancies it will be nec
essary to hold the examination soon.
Before taking action, however, the
Civil Service Commission will await
a request from the Police Commission
that the necessity exists for an eligi
ble list of lieutenants.

UXIOXTOWN, Pa.. Dec. 23. â Con
victed of murder in the second degree
and then restored to his family, James
Swaney will pass Christmas with his
wife and twelve children at his own
fireside on Â¦ the mountain . side near
Haydentown, where the crime was
committed. Then Swaney will return
to Uniontown to receive his sentence
And go to the penitentiary. The kind
ness shown by the court was agreed
to by the prosecution and four brothers
of the prisoner went on his bond for
$10,000. .*
The conviction grew out of the feud
between the Turner and Swaney fac
tions, which has been bitter for years.
It is said that William Turner, who
was the victim in this instance, was
sentenced several years ago to a year;
in Jail for a petty crime, and that, ow
ing to the inability of the Sheriff to
escort him at the time fixed. Turner
went alone to Pittshurg and presented
himself to the jailer 'for incarceration.
Convicted of Murder, James Swaney

TACOMA, Dec. 23. â Arthur Whal
ley, a news agent of Dawson, has gone
to San Francisco to spend the holidays
with friends, including a young
woman, who will become his bride
next month. The bride-elect is Miss
Eleanor Soper, daughter of a San
Francisco physician. The marriage
will be the culmination of a Klondike
romance, though Miss Soper has never
been in the ndrth.
For a number of -years Whalley has
been associated in business at Daw
son with his cousin, Ernest M. Whal
ley, who was married in Dawson last
February to a young lady of San Fran
cisco. For business reasons it was im
possible for Ernest AVhalley to go to
San Francisco for his bride. Not der
siring that she should go north alone,
it was arranged that Arthur Whalley
should spend a month's vacation in
California last winter and on return
ing take his cousin's bride to Dawson
over the ice. He went south from
Dawson heart and fancy free. In San
Francisco he met the sweetheart of
the days of his earlier youth, with the
result that when he "left the Golden
Gate for the Klondike his former girl
friend wbs â¢ wearing an engagement
ring. After their wedding in January
Whalley and his bride will spend a
part of the winter in Southern Cali

PORTLAND, Dec. 23.â Shackled with
leg irons and attired in nothing but
his night clothes, Thurlow W. Parker,
alias Brown, the aJleged forger, who
has been eluding the Portland police
for weeks, walked off the sci;thbound
Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
pany's train early this morning at
Umatllla station and made IrTs escape
while Detective Day slumbered in a
Pullman palace car berth. The officer
retired at 9 o'clock last night, leaving
his prisoner in charge of a negro por
ter, who went to sleep. Parker took ad
vantage of the porter's slumber to
make his escape.
Parker, who is but 21 years old, is
the son of -well-known residents at
Deer Lodge, Mont. He is accused of
forging more than $500 worth of checks
in Portland about six weeks ago. He
was located in Helena and arrested and
was being brought to Portland for trial.
Another man of national fame who
will address the assemblage is E. Ben
jamin Andrews, chancellor of the State
University of Nebraska. During the
campaign of 1896 Andrews was forced
out of the presidency of Brown Uni
versity for advocating the free coin
age of silver and the election of
Bryan.
Governor Heber M. Wells, a bril
liant orator and extensive stock raiser,
will have a place on the programme.
Another speaker who will attract wide
attention is Colonel John P. Irish of
San Francisco.
Paul BlcCprmlck of Montana, who
owns between 40.000 and 50,000 head
of cattle, will speak on "Market Condi
tions in 1903 and Their Remedy."
The local entertainment committee
has outlined a programme which pro
vides for one night's exploration of the
Chinese quarter, a theater party, a re
ception to the ladies, a Press Club
Fmoker and an excursion down the Co
lumbia River to th,e sea.
Perhaps the most interesting of the
many speakers will be Jerry Simpson
of Kansas, who rode into the halls of
Congress on the Populist wave of 1S92
and became widely known as "Sock
less Jerry." He w&s retired from poli
tics in 1S98 and went Into the cattle
business on a large scale in South
western Kansas. A year ago he sold
out his interests there and removed to
Roswell. N- M. For years lie has been

SAN JOSE DE GUAYMAS, Dec. 23.â
Abraham Morales, who has just re
turned from Buenos Ayres, reports
that the savage Seri Indians who raid
ed the El Poso ranch about two weeks
ago, killing James, Fox and a number
of his men, have been cornered in the
Santa Ursula mountains by a pursu
ing party under Jose Marfa Diaz, pre
fect of police of this placed The In
dians have been pursued for days by
the persistent party under. Diaz, who
intercepted them and prevented them
from coming out in the open along the
coast and crossing to their native is
land of Tiburon. It Is believed that the
Indians are not well armed, as they
have, evidently feared to engage in a
fight with Diaz and his men.
' The band passed within a short dis
tance of Lamanga and Los Algodones
but. did not disturb the inhabitants of
either- place,- -who were prepared for a
fight, j Those . who saw the Indians say
they are all Serls and that there are
no Yaquis with them, as -was first sup
posed.* There are about thirty in the
band. The party under Diaz came up
on the remains of four horses which
had "been eaten . by the starving In
dians., When- last heard from Diaz and
his men had the Seris completely
hemmed in ' where they must either
fight or surrender, in which case their
leaders will undoubtedly be executed
and the remainder deported to Yuca
tan.
TOMBSTONE, Ariz.. Dec. 23.-Sheriff
Lewis of Coch!se County has given up
the hunt for Alvord and Stilus. He has
withdrawn all of his posses from the
field and except for the Arizona Rang
ers, ' under Captain Rynning, who is
still believed to-be in pursuit of the
escaped felons somewhere west of the
Huachuca Mountains, there are no
posses on the trail of the desperadoes.
. Deputy Sheriff Larrleu returned to
Fairbank this morning and reported
that Stiles and Alvord stopped at the
stone house of the Boquillas Cattle
Company Monday night and at the
point of two sixshooters compelled the
bookkeeper, the" only man there at the
time, to turn over two fresh horses.
They threatened to return and kill him
if he informed the officers that.thsy
had stopped there. It is now generally
believed that the outlaws havu doubled
back on their trail, dodged Uie rangers
and are now concealed at some of the
ranches In Cochise County, where they
have friends.

How is this possible ?
Because Scott's Emulsion,
is one of the richest and most

Because Scott's Emulsion
makes all good food do good.
Nothing of value to the body
is allowed to go to waste.
Because Scott's Emulsion
makes the stomach strong,
the appetite keen and the

BERKELEY. Dec. 23.â Feliclen Vic
tor Paget. emeritus professor of the Ro
manic languages and literature at the
University of California, passed away
to-day at his home, 2737 Dwlght way.
after a long struggle against illness.
Apoplexy is given as the immediate
cause of death, though Professor Paget
had been in failing health for more
than a year from other causes. His
illness was so weakening that he had
been unable to participate actively in
the university's work r and at the April
meeting of the Board of Regents, that
he mieht be relieved of some of his
burdens, he was made professor emeri
tus. He did not resume his work, how
ever, when the fall term* began, as he
became gradually weaker. A hamor
rhage three weeks ago decided his fate
and hastened the end that came at an
early hour this morning.
Anxiety for her husband and a long
period of nursing have had a grave ef
fect upon the health of Madame Paget,
and she is now so ill that she is not
expected to survive for long. She had
lately been unable to care for her hus
band and lies a hopeless invalid.
Professor Pacet had been a member
of the faculty of the University of Cali
fornia fc-r sixteen years. He* came to
the university in 1SS7 as an instructor
in French and Spanish, being the first
instructor in the department of Ro
manic languages, which was enlarged
from time to time under his direction.
In 1S91 he was promoted to an assistant
professorship. In 1893 to an associate
professorship and in 1S94 he was ap
pointed professor of the French and
Spanish languages. In 1S98 his title
was extended to include the French
and Spanish literatures, as weJl as the
languages, and in 1900 the wording was
changed to "Professor of the Romanic
languages and literatures." During his
long service Professor Paget endeared
himself to his many associates and stu
dents and was much revered for his
kindliness and generosity.
The nativity of Professor Paget was
Petit-Villard, France, where he was
born on June 27. 1833. his age being,
therefore, 70 years. His was an old and
honorable family of Franche-Comte.
He studied at the University of Stras
bourg, which gave . him the degree of
Bachelier des Lettres on November 6.
1S62. The University of Grenoble grant
ed him the degree of Bachelier des Sci
ences on November 7, 1S65. In his col
lege education his attention was de
voted particularly to the classics and
history, his researches carrying him to
many places about Europe.
When thÂ« Franco-Prussian war broke
out, young Paget joined the French
army as an officer in the Francs Ti
reurs. In 1S79, while in Paris, he mar
ried Emmanuel Marie Jacquet, who
survives him.
At the close of the war Professor
Paget came to America and later to
San Francisco. He taught the French
and Spanish languages and lectured.
He was particularly interested in the
exposition of Victor Hugo and the phi
lology of old French. In collaboration
with Professor Edward T. Owen of
the University of Wisconsin, formerly
professor of French at the University
of California, he published annotated
editions of the "Les Travailleurs de la
Mer," by Victor Hugo; of "Ursule
Mirouet," by M. de Balzac, and " ot
"Cinq-Mars," by Alfred de Vigny. .
The funeral of Professor Paget will
be held to-morrow afternoon at 2
o'clock from the Jate residence. Rev.
A. R. Wooster of the Swedenborgian
Church o*f San Francisco will officiate.
The contract for bituminizing Dupont
street from Pacific to Broadway was
awarded to the City. Street Improve
ment Company, and that for construct
ing sheds and doing the yard work of
the Noe Valley School to J. J. Dowling.
The board was served with injunc
tion papers restraining it from inter
fering with the tearing up of Filbert
street for the purpose of laying a spur
track thereon, for which a permit was
granted by the Board of Supervisors to
the St. Mary's Help Hospital.
The petition of the Baldwin Contract
ing Company for permission to grade
Lombard street between Sansome and
Winthrop was denied. G. Folsom com
plained that the company had used ex
cessive charges of dynamite in blast
ing on the street and Officer J. N.
Beach was detailed to stop the opera
tions, as the Board of Supervisors had
rescinded all former blasting permits.
Action on the proposed grade changes
on Parnassus avenue from Third to
Seventh was postponed until . next
Tuesday. Protests were registered by
tht? Sutro estate and Attorney Snook,
representing the Regents of the State
University.
This decision on the part of the Civil
> Service Commission Is practically an
' ; approval of the star.d taken by the
; Board of Public Works in refusing to
; comply with the request of the Board
I of Education that James B. McSheehy.
! inspector of school buildings, be dis
j missed. The Board of Works insists
i that McSheehy, who is a civil service
| man, be retained to supervise neces
; sary repairs to seventy-five school
j buildings.' As McSheehy was certified
' from the list of inspector of school
j buildings, the board is fortified in its
! position by the mandate of the Civil
I Service Commission.
Attorney Garoutte and Assistant En
| gineer Forbes of the Spring Valley Wa
i ter Works appeared before the board
relative to the opening of Nineteenth
avenue. They stated that the directors
of the corporation will meet shortly
to take steps to convey the necessary
land to the city for the purpose, an ap
propriation having been made to pur
! chase the land.
TOO MUCH DYNAMITE.
The commission suggests that requi
sition bo made for the certification of
an aDDlicant from any of .these lists
for appointment as storekeeper of the
Board of Education. The comm>slon
has approved Commary's appointment
for December, but says that in* view of
the statement of the duties of his posi
tion such approval is not to be con
sidered a precedent for the future ap
pointment of Commary, who is a tem
porary nc-n-civil service employe, to the
position he now occupies.
UPHOLDS WORKS BOARD.
The Civil Service Commission yes
terday notified the Board of Public
Works that th^ duties now performed
by W. F. Commary as storekeeper for
the Board of Education should be per
formed by an eligible applicant from
any of the three following lists: In
spector t! school buildings, bookkeep
ers. Board of Public Works, and expe
rienced clerks". Board of Public Works.
The case of the "Xymphia." "decided by
Juijres Hebbard and Murasky, Is !n no way a
parallel case to this; the same 1* true of th<?
rase of Pon and Vincent and Lair, decided re
spectively by Judges Seawell and Kerrigan;
likewise the case of Sellinger. decided by my
self. None of the**, cases presented anything
having the best analogy to this. The case of
Paris, hereinbefore referred to, decided by
Judge Seawell, is similar to this case and. as
before stated, for the reasons given In Judge
Seawell's opinion in that case, the injunction
hÂ«re prayed for must be granted. Plaintiff
will prepare flndlncs.
I can see no distinction between this case
and the case of Paris vs. Wltfman, tried and
decided in Department No. 1 of this court: and
for the reasons given by Judge Seawell In his
opinion filed In that case I am satisfied that
plaintiff herein ehould have judgment as
prayed for in his complaint.
Of course the injunction can only prevent
trespass and the unlawful acts of the defend
ant; that whloh the law permits him to do he
can continue to do. He undoubtedly has the
right to enter the premises for the purpoee of
serving a warrant, order, wriP or crocess of
court if any he bas. or to make an arrest for
a crime committed within his view or presence,
or to prevent treason, felony or breach of the
peace: but no man. whether he b-; an officer or
mere citixen, has the rleht to picket, blockade
or interfere with the legitimate business of
another, and to place officers or nen In front
of a man's place of business and stop every
person entering the premise?, to take th-ir
names or In any way to Intimidate those seek
ing to enter ruch premises, as an unlawful in
terference with the business therein conducted,
and can unquestionably be srevented by in
junction; it is unlawful and It is a trespass
against the rights of another.
It 'Is no answer to say. as does defendant's
counsel, that no place can be made a sanc
tuary for crime. It Is clear from the evidence
in this case, that no crime is even charged to
have been committed In the restaurant or
ctuar store of Dlalntlff, and If crime is com
mitted in the rear of the premises In which
plaintiff's business Is located the law Is am
ply sufficient to prevent Its becoming .a sanc
tuary for crime: a warrant of arrest will meet
the situation: or If the arrest is to be for
treason, felony or breach of the public peace
by loud and tumultuous noLses. the arrest can
be made without any warrant, because for
such ruryioses private premises may be law
fully entered.
Judge Cook handed down n decision
yesterday afternoon on the application
for an injunction made by Jean Pon,
owner and proprietor of a restaurant
and cigar business at 1129 Dupont
street to restrain the police through
Chief Wittman from trespassing upon
the entrance to the premises en which
his places of business are located, al
leging such trespassing to be an injury.
The Judge granted the injunction and
ordered the plaintiff to prepare findings.
At the same time the Judge handed
down a decision in the case of George
Sellinger against Chief Wittman deny
ing Selllnger's motion for a new trial.
Sellinger *s the lessee of th? buildings
in the rear of Â«Pon's restaurant. They
are used for immoral purposes and Sel-
Unger applied for an injunction to re
strainHhe police from trespassing upon
his premises, but the Judge refused to
grant it.
In regard to the Pon case the de
cision says: â¢
The tow completed to-night is the
longest ever undertaken on the Pacific.
Few tugs could have lived through tha
storms encountered by the Tyee on her
voyage north. She rode out gales
which wrecked the Nome steamer Dis
covery, with. the loss of twenty-five or
thirty lives, and which tested the sea
worthiness of such stanch vessels as
the Nome City and the Bctha. So rough
was the weather that it took the Tyee
nearly as long to make the run to
Dutch Harbor as it did for her to bring
the heavy and unwieldy tow back. The
tug reached Dutch Harbor November
18. She set out oh the return voyage
November 22.
SEATTLE. Wash.. Dec. 23.â Complet
ing one of the longest and most diffi
cult tows on record, the tug Tyee, with
the disabled freight steamship Meteor,
arrived to-nisht from Dutch Harbor.
Since leaving Seattle two months ago
the Tyee has completed more than 50<X>
miles of sea travel. Three months ago
the Meteor, in command of Captain
Charles W. Ames, set sail from this
port under charter to the North Ameri
can Transportation and Trading Com
pany with 2400 tons of coal and gen
eral freight for St. Michaels. She got
within less than 100 miles of her desti
nation, when en the morning of Octo
ber 6 she broke down in Bering Sea at
a point sixty-seven miles south of
Nome. Her mishap consisted of the
loss of her rudder and rudder post,
which in clearing the ship carried away
the flukes of the propeller. Thus dis
abled, the Meteor drifted sixteen miles
down toward the Yukon fiat, where
she was picked up by her sister ship,
the steamship Eureka, and towed back
to Dutch Harbor. The Eureka was at
that time under charter to the North
western Commercial Company, though
she and the Meteor are owned by the
Globe Navigation Company. At Dutch
Harbor the Eureka left the Meteor and
it was to tow the latter on to this port
that the Tyee. with Captain John S.
Boiling as master, was dispatched
north.
J. J. Aghew. husband of the preced
ing witness, gave similar evidence. He
acknowledged Dunsmuir as an intelli
gent business man with none of hi3
faculties impaired. The only business
transaction he had with him was in
regard to buying a pair of horses for
him. He testified as to the signing of
the will and gave evidence, as did his
wife, that Dunsmuir did not wish either
Willie ei\Edna (Mrs. Wallace's children)
to have any of his money, and that
Dunsmuir intended James Dunsmuir,
his brother, to be his heir.
The wedding of the late Alexander
Dunsmuir and Mrs. Wallace was a dry
affair, so said John K. Agnew, on cross
examination. Mrs. Wallace had sent
some champagne, but it was not open
ed. He had not. thought, he said, that
this was to prevent Alexander Duns
muir from getting it. After dinner the
will had been signed in his presence
and that of Messrs. Lowe, Taylor and
James Dunsmuir.
Mrs. Agnew was questioned at length
by counsel, tending to show there had
been a break in their friendship. She
said she had not visited Mrs. Duns
muir much after that, they having
been estranged on account of some
slight differences. She had tried to
see Mrs. Dunsmuir when she was dy
ing, but had been told Mrs. Dungmuir
would not see her.
Mrs. Wallace j had made a will in
1898. or in the early part of 1S99.
whjch the witness witnessed. This had
been given to Alexander Dunsmuir to
read. He objected to it. stating he
would not allow her to leave any of the
property to Mrs. Hopper, and tore the
will up and threw it into the fire.
As to Dunsmuir drinking, witness
said he was ill occasionally and Mrs.
Wallace had told her this was due to
excessive drinking.
In answer to a scries of questions in
regard to witness having consulted at
torneys who were preparing a defense
in this action, she said he ha,d expressed
strong disapproval of Mrs. Hopper's ac
tion In bringing suit on one visit paid
her by Attorney Heinman a^t her house.
She denied having said to some people
that ""two- words of mine one way or
the other would settle this case."
Counsel questioned at length regard
ing the interview of James and Alexan
der Dunsmuir when arrangements were
made for an allowance of a thousand
dollars a month to Mrs. Wallace. Wit
ness sa!d" Mrs. Wallace had often inti
mated tc her her anxiety regarding fu
ture financial arrangements, and al
ways had implicit reliance in James
Dunsmuir's good intent toward her.
VICTORIA. Dec. 23.â In the Hop
per-Dunsmuir will case to-day Mrs.
Ajrnew, who yesterday afternoon gave
evidence that Alexander Dunsmuir had
always spoken, to the effect that he
intended James Dunsmuir to be his
heir, was cross-examined by counsel
for Edna Wallace Hopper. She said
that as an intimate friend of Mrs.
Wallace she had known her relations
to Alexander Dunsmuir. Mrs. Wal
lace always. told witness she expected
Alexander Dunsmuir' to marry her.
The reason why he had not done so
at once was because he hacTfeared his
mother (who is an intervener in this
case) would cut him off.
Mrs. Agnew also told of having gone
to Rev. E. B. Shaw of Oakland about
a couple of weeks before the mar
riage at the request of both Alexander
Dunsmuir and Mrs. Wallace. She had
at that time told the Rev. Mr. Shaw
that Dunsmuir and Mrs. Wallace had
been living together under contract to
each other.

Claim Revived.
When the United States Government
was an infant just setting up shop on
the banks of the Potomac there wasn't
enough money in the national strong
box to build a shelter for it. The com
paratively venerable commonwealth of
Virginia helped the struggling young
ster out by lending it $120,000. The loan
was authorized by the Virginia Gen
eral Assembly on December 27. 1790. and
the money was to be used by the young
Government for public buildings. For
sixty years the creditor made no ef
fort to collect this loan from Uncle
Sam. but In 1850. the Federal Govern
ment appearing to be prosperous
enough to Justify it. Virginia asked to
be reimbursed. The Washington au
thorities didn't pay, and now Senator-
John Warwick Daniel has taken up
Virginia's claim and introduced a bill
in 'the Senate for its payment with in
terest since 1850. The creditor State is
willing to have Uncle Sam deduct from
its claim any money due him, but It
believes it is time the advance was re

Spain and South 'America.
It Is declared on the authority of thÂ»
Madrid correspondent of the London
Times that the movement for closer
commercial relations betw?en Spain
and the South American states has
reached a stage which Is attracting
attention. It is a movement In which
the United States is directly concerned.
Racial and linguistic ties play their
part in commercial affairs, and it is
probable that the issue which has
arisen with Colombia over the canal
does not tend to improve th** relations
of other South American communities
with the United States. The South
American countries would find it con
venient to appea.1 to the United States
to assert the Monroe doctrine against
European aggression, but the political
relation which the doctrine implies has
heretofore contributed but little toward
the commerce of the United States wit*

Hour of Deaths.
A French physician has utilized ex

hcur of death of 1830 persons of all ages
in a mixed population and during a pe
riod of several years. The statistics col
lected by him show that the greatest
number of deaths occur In the hour be
tween 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning,
the smallest between 9 and 11 o'clock
in the morning. From 10 a. m. to 3 p. m.
the mortality Is not high, and tho most
fatal hours are from S to 6 a. m. These
figures coincide with >on&M?stnblished

A Broken Sky.
A downtown merchant has a little
boy whom he rates as one of the
brightest youngsters in thi3 city. A
few days ago, while at lunch, as was
his custom, he began, telling how
bright the little fellow was. "Why,"
he said, "you remember, here a few
weeks ago. we had a light thunder
storm. I happened to be in bed when
the storm began. Just when the
storm was at its height and the rolling
of the thunder loud enough to fright
en most any one, my little boy rushed
in. His eyes looked as big a saucers
and he certainly was frightened. He
crawled into my arms and commenced
to sob. Finally he got his breath and
told me he was frightened because
'the. sky was all broked.' "
THE lover of the picturesque in nature will joy to
learn of pathways to the summit of Mount Whitney
and to the head of the Kings River Canyon that
will make it easier to reach those famous places. The
Inyo Independent tells of the Mount Whitney trail. The
people of Lone Pine, it says, "have made a direct trail to
the top of Mount Whitney from Lone Pine, which is easy
of ascent with paddle horses and pack mules. It is a
two days' trip by this trail from Lone Pine to the summit
and back, but the trip can be made in one day with a
good saddle animal."
The informant of the Independent is E. H. Edwards.
While fie reports that the trip can be made in one day he
suggests that to do justice to the scenery a longer time
should be devoted. "Parties not in a rush and wishing
to admire the beauties of nature should take three days
for the trip, camping at Lone Pine, Whitney Canyon, at
the Panaway Falls in Ibex Park, also at Deer Glen Mead
ows, near the timber line."
Other plans are in view to make Mount Whitney's lofty
peak accessible from another direction, the route to con
nect with the present trail by way of Visalia or Porter
vilie. It is also proposed by the people of Visalia, Porter
ville and Tulare to make a trail from the Saw Teeth
Mountains, gradually ascending the summit of Mount
Whitney, there to connect with the Lone Pine trail. Those
who wish can then descend to Lone Pine and complete
the circuit. Mr. Edwards writes to the Independent
that "if any party is not satisfied with being at the place
nearest to heaven in the United States, the summit of
Mount Whitney, it will be able to secure animals to Lone
Pine and a guide to lead in two days into the sink of
Death Valley, 500 feet below sea level, nevt to Hades."
The Visalia Times describes the new means of access
to the head of the Kings River Canyon. A new road will
probably be completed by the ist- of July next from
Happy Gap through the General Grant National Park to
the head of the canyon at Copper Creek. "This," says
the Times, "will make a direct route from Visalia and
from Sangcr to the Kings River Canyon. The grade
from Happy Gap into the park being eliminated, the trip
from Visalia or Sanger can be made to the canyon in
two days. The projected route from the park is by way
of the Tornado Meadows to Bubbs Creek."
These localities are familiar to the thousands of active
Californians who have at one time or another penetrated
to the Kings River Canyon to contemplate its indescrib
able grandeur. A hint of other path making to great
scenery is suggested by the Times, which says:
"When the proposed road has been completed to the
Kings River Canyon it will be in order to construct an
other from the latter to the Giant Forest, so that the
circuit could be made by conveyance, the road into the
forest having been completed early this fall."
PATHS TO GREAT SCENERY.
Berkeley, well equipped in all the advantages that en
dow and adorn the intellect, is now determined that she
will place her shoulder to the wheel of effort and make

movement justifies already the high hopes of its success.
'A Poser for the Jurist.
None ranked higher at the bar of
California than the late Judge E. W.
McKinstry. In many respects he
stood head and shoulders above his
fellows in the law. His counsel was
sought by men who handled millions
in money and property. But the great
jurist was badly stumped once and
was compelled to go forth for assist
ance to save a humble Chinese cook.
It was in this wise:
.Judge McKinstry was trying a cele
brated land and riparian rights case,
involving $1,000,000. With him as as
sociate counsel was Walker C. Graves,
who was a relative of some of the liti
gants on McKinstry's side of the bat
tle.
Just before the noon recess one day
word came to the eminent attorney
that Ah Gow, his favorite chef, an
apparently peaceable toiler In the
McKinstry domicile, had. been arrest
ed on a charge of murder. Now Judge
McKinstry could imperturbably wage
fights that took him into the deepest
intricacies of land titles and what not,
but a police case completely floored
the distinguished Blackstonian. He
showed his mental distress so keenly
that Graves queried.
"See here, Graves, my cook has been
arrested for murder. What in heav
en's name shall I do?" pleaded Mc-
Kinstry.
"Do?" echoed Graves, not a bit sur
prised. "Do? Why, get him out."
"Get him out? I can't get him out
I don't know anything about this sort
of thing," declared the now thorough
ly excited lawyer,
"Well, I'll see what I can do then,"
said Graves, leaving McKinstry to
wrestle wit,h the million dollar trial.
Off posted the associate counsel.
When court reconvened after recess
Graves returned. *
"What did you do?" queried McKin
stry.
"I got youri Chinaman out and he
will cook your dinner to-night," re
plied Graves.
"Thank heaven for that," came fer
vently from McKinstry, who buckled
to work with evident satisfaction.
Gas for Illuminating.
By MALCOLM McDOWELL.
(ttVtfccr of rgboj) Talk on the Wonderi of the
Crafts.')
(CoryrlEht. I0C3, Ly Joseph B. Bowles.)
Many gas experts believe that the
time is not far distant when artificial
gas will be "piped" anywhere from
fifty to a hundred miles from the point
of its production. This means that
X>rogressive engineers are planning to
give farmers and the inhabitants of
email towns and villages the blessings
of illuminatir.g and fuel gas.
Natural gas has been carried long
distances. When the initial well pres
sure was high enoujrh no pumps or gas
compressing machinery were required.
The fortunate dwellers in the natural
gas fields and in towns and cities with
ing reach of the wells were given the
comfort and cheer which goes with
the use of gas. Many gas wells in
such territories have gv n out, and
the natural sas consumers have been
obliged to fall back on coal and wood
and return to kerosene lamps. The
advent of high-pressure artificial gas
promises to restore to those people the
fuel and light they have lost.
Near Chicago are several gas plants
which distribute artificial gas under
pressures ranging from twenty to thir
ty pounds to the square inch. One of
them, the North Shore Gas Company,
has its works at Waukegan and sup
plies a territory some sixteen miles
long, in which are' half a dozen good
sized towns, the military reservation of
Fort Sheridan, Lake Forest University,
some golf clubs and several schools and
academies. Intervals of two or thre?
miles between tCtvns occur, in which
there are occasional farmhouses. The
line is over fourteen miles long, exclu
sive of branches, and is constructed of
four-inch pipes, (hrough which the gas
is forced at an initial pressure of twen
ty to thirty pounds to the square inch,
with surprisingly small loss in pressure
at the terminal of the line fourteen
miles away.
The plant has been distributing high
pressure artificial gas for several years
and the results led its general man
ager, George F. Goodnow, to write as
follows:
"Constant observation of this meth
od of distribution leads to speculation
regarding the field of operations and
the use to which it may be put. Large
cities and towns may be girdled with
high-pressure mains, and distant regu
lators branched off to feed existing low
pressure mains at points where the
supply is adequate, and much expense
be saved In construction of large feed
mains and a much more even distribu
tion be maintained. The reason does
not appear why coke oven plants or
other cheap methods of manufacture
cannot be located near coal fields or
near navigable waters, where cheap
coal or oil may be secured and the pro
duct piped long distances under high
pressure to centers of population. The
extent of gas compression has not yet
been determined, and whether thirty or
forty or 100 pounds is the limit only
careful Ftudy ajid experiment can dem
onstrate, but that twenty-five to thirty
pounds' pressure docs not commercially
deteriorate the quality of the gas for
lighting or heating purposes I feel con
fident."
Great care is taken in putting togeth
er the pipe for high -pressure gas. The
pipe Is stronger and heavier than or
dinary pipe, and all fittings and valves
sre specially made. Several hundred
feet of the pipe line is coupled up on
the bank beside the trench and tested
with an air pressure of sixty pounds
to the square inch â at least twice as
much pressure as the pipe ever will be
required to carry. If It is found tight
the pipe is lowered into the trench,
handled very much like a long line of
large hose.
There are several ways of distribut
ing gas under the high-pressure sys
tem. One way is to build gas holders,
or reservoirs, in each center of popula
tion; the gas is sent from the central
plant under pressure to these holders,
but is distributed from the reservoirs
under ordinary pressure. Another way
is to install what are called "district
regulators." A regulating device which
reduces the high to ordinary pressure
Ss put in between the main line and the
Fygtem of branches which make the
district, and all gas in this district is
supplied to consumers at ordinary pres
sure. The other method carries the high
pressure to the individual meter. Just
before it reaches the meter a regulator
reduces the pressure so that the gas
enters the meter at the ordinary pres
sure used in houses. Devices .are placed
v, hi ch allow the gas to escape to the
outer air should the regulator be broken
or disarranged, soithat it is practically
impossible for the gas to enter the
house under high pressure. An air com-
X>resser. slightly modified, compresses
the gas to the required carrying pres
sure, and daily observations and care
ful comparisons fail to show that con
densed gas loses any of its illuminating
powers by being compressed.
This is what is coming with artificial
gas distributed under .high pressure:
The principal country roads lighted
from end to end by incandescent man
tle gas lamps; farm houses with gas in
every room and a gas stove in the
kitchen: crossroad villages illuminated:
thrashing machinery, hay choppers,
dairy machinery, farm pumps, the little
village factories and isolated industrial
establishments operated by gas motors,
and far out suburbs with sparse popu
lation enjoying: all the benefits which
Rough and Ready Defense.
(Athletic Kxpert New York Evening World.
Author of "Muscle Building," Etc.)
(Copyright, 1903, by Joseph B. Bowles.)
The golden rule for street fights is:
"Keer> out of them."
The man who wantonly provokes a
fight of any sort is a rowdy. The man
who willingly indulges in a 'street fight
is doubly so.
Moreover, these lessons are for the
purpose of teaching the graceful and
strength-Imparting art of boxing.
Slugging or rowdyism 'has no part in
them.
Yet one of the main objects of box
fne is to teach its devotees How to de
fend themselves should th* occasion
arise. And no matter how peaceably
inclined you may be the time may come
when you will find i^ necessary to fight.
Therefore it is well to know how to
fight. The^ man who is carrying $10,003
to the bank also carries a revolver.
He does, not carry it with the idea of
firing into the crowd or of taking pot
shots at any enemy he may see on the
opposite side of the street. He is armed
simply in order to defend himself
should the treasure which he is guard
ing be attacked.
There is the same difference between
the boy who fights merely in self-de
fense when forced to do sd and the
rowdy who goes around "looking for
trouble" as there is between the armed
bank messenger and the cowboy des
perado who used to rejoice in "shooting
up the town a whole lot."
If a man or two men should attempt
to "hold you up" it is well to know a
few ways of protecting yourself. If a
tough, drunk or sober, should take it
into his head that a thrashing would do
you good, would you not like to know
how tt\utillze your boxing lore In such
a way as to avert that thrashing? '
Now, let us get to work, beginning as
iisual by going over all the various
points we have thus far studied, from
left lead for the face down to pivot
blow and back swing.
In the first place let* me reiterate that
it is always best to keep out of a street
fight when you can. Do not do any
thing to provoke one, and keep out of
such a row even at the risk of incurring
the charge of cowardice.
But when a fight can no longer be
avoided do not give up while you can
stand. Keep at it as long as an atom
of life remains in your body. Poor
pottering, verbose old Polonius knew
for once what he was talking about
when he said:
Coolness Is next U valv, to courage
in a fight. If you lose your head and
get rattled" your knowledge, of box-
Ing will forsake you and you will be
just a trifle more helpless than u new
b OT n baby, if, on the other hand, you
keep cool and bring into use the box
ing m tricks I have taught . you the
chances are in favor of your conquer
ing a fellow twice your size.
For one thing, the tough who goes
around picking fights is often more or
less under the influence of liquor In
such condition a man cannot do jus
tice to his muscles. Drink often makes
a man long to fight, but it always less
ens his fighting powers. You may thus
find assailants of that sort far easier
to dispose of by use of a little skill and
coolness than you would imagine.
Another point in your favor in such
a contest Is that the tough or hold-up
Is seldom in condition. His style of
life and choice of recreations do not
conduce to athletic form, endurance or
great science. The athlete who is a
good boxer and who trains and exer
cises regularly is not as/a, rule the sort
of fellow who holds people up or tries
to pick quarrels with them on the
street. The street fighter Is usually a
drink-weakened tough, a loafer whose
muscles are flabby and whose wind is
poor, or else a longshoreman or work
man whose science is ill developed, and
who, while frequently powerful, is slow
and heavy in his motions.
Against all such men the trained box
er has an Incredible advantage. Cool
ness, speed, precision, endurance and
science all fight on his side and help
him to win.
Up to this point, as you will see, the
odds are all in your favor, and they
may be greatly increased by free use
of that Yankee attribute commonly
known as "bluff." ""*"
You know, for instance, what cards
your assailant is likely to hold. You
know he is vicious and quarrelsome,
you know he is likely to be out of
training or else slow and unskilled.
He, on the contrary, knows nothing
a'- out you,. He does not know whether
you are a weakling or a famous light
weight pugilist. If you can impress
him at once wi^i the belief that you
are the latter he will often be as eager
to quit the fight as he was to begin it
Don't, therefore, wait for him to as
sume ' aggressive r-d rush you.
When you see that the fight is inevit
able and that you have no chance to
back out attack Tiim at once. J V?Â« V
Next to avoiding a street fight the
first, last and best rule to observe on
such occasions Is this: Always strike
the first blow; strike it with full force,
full skill and with full speed. Aim it
at the point of the jaw if you can, and
follow it up by an unceasing volley of
other blows. Don't stop lone enough
to let your opponent assume the ag
gressive. Keep him on the defensive,
and at every stage of the game let him
know you are there and that you are
there to stav.
Don't rush' wildly, swinging your
arms like flails and wasting the .breath
you mar need for a long flght. But
plant every blow _as skillfully as if
you were in a prize boxing bout: be
as wary Jn guarding and make each
motion count in your favor. Take ad
vantage of every opening. - You will
find the work easier than a boxing bout
with your sparring partner,, fir '/'.he
chances are that the latter knows much
more about boxing, is in better condi
tion and will leave fewer openings than
will your street foe.
And remember throughout to keep
on attacking and to give your enemy
no criance to recover from the surprise
your first blow imparted to him. *

THE CALL said recently that the question of sov
ereignty and the right of revolution, involved in the
Panama matter, could not be submitted to the
Hague tribunal. This view is now approved by the for
eign diplomats, and is expressed by one of them at
Washington, who says: "Nations can hardly be ex
pected to settle questions of sovereignty and national
honor at the Hague. Moreover, in my opinion, it would
not be within the province of the Washington govern
ment to grant such request from Colombia. It is to Pa
nama and not to, Washington that Colombia should ta>:e
such a proposition."
1 The Call also said that the assumption, of her due
share of the Colombian debt by Panama could properly
I go to the Hague, if not otherwise adjusted.' 1 The same
diplomatic authority indorses^this by saying: "There is,
however, a question between Colombia and Panama
I which with all propriety might be referred 19 the Hague,
and to which reference the United States will scarcely
offer objection. It is the question of the assumption by
Panama of a part of the Colombian debt. If General
Reyes should ask the United States to use its good
offices to have this matter brought before the Hague,
Panama might safely acquiesce in such a proposition."
Our views being so 'far entirely indorsed, we venture
further to say that the United States will effectively use
its good offices to prevail upon Panama to voluntarily
assume a just share of the debt, and we have no doubt
that the new republic will readily assent to that course.
It has merit that is not found in the alternative propo
sition, that Panama pay directly to Colombia a, part of
the $10,000,000 she will receive from us for the canal,
equal to her share in the debt. She will be far safer to
assume the share of the debt directly', because, with her
future prospects of prosperity and stability, she can
easily refund it. on longer maturity and lower interest,
and enjoy the use of what we will pay her, in the estab
lishment of. her nationality and institutions.
The diplomats also agree that when the European
powers recognized; Panama, they sealed with approval
the course of the United States. This was done in re
cognition of our right to realize the commercial needs
and expectations of the, world, in the building of the
canal.
Colombia's crude ideas are disclosed in the dispatch to
Reyes, in the statement that under the treaty of 1846 we
lack the right of initiative in protecting isthmian transit.
The language of the treaty is this: "The United States
; guaranty positively and efficaciously to New Granada,
I by the present stipulation, the perfect neutrality of the
before mentioned isthmus, with the view that the free
transit from one to the other sea may not be interrupted
nor embarrassed* in any future time while this tfeaty ex
ists." How can we make that guaranty good if the ini
tiative be left to Colombia? In transmitting the treaty
to the Senate for ratification, President Polk said: "The
importance of this â¢ concession to the commercial and
political interests of the United States cannot easily be
overrated."
In 1835 the United States Senate by resolution called
on the President to consider the expediency of opening
negotiations with New Granada, for the purpose of "ef
! fectually protecting, by treaty stipulations, such com
panies or individuals as may undertake to build a ship
canal across the isthmus, and of securing forever by
such stipulations the free and equal right of navigating
such canal to all nations." The treaty made that reso
lution effective. Mr. Polk said of it: "We are more
deeply interested in this guaranty "than New Granada
herself or any other country. Such a guaranty is almost
indispensable to the construction of a railroad or ship
canal across the territory. Neither sovereign states
nor individuals would expend their capital in the con
struct Jon of these expensive works, without some such
security for their investments."
It will be sden by all this that if we had no right to
protect the isthmus, except when requested by New Gra
nada or her sovereign successor, Colombia, our guaranty
was not worth the ink in which it was written. In fact
I the concession to us was absolute. Our guaranty was
not subordinate to Colpmbia at all, for if it were it
wo: id have been a vain thing and the treaty an idle trick.
If we did not acquire the right of initiative we acquired
nothing. As Polk made the treaty, and it was ratified by
a Senate in which sat members who voted for the reso
lution of 1835, there can be no doubt about the meaning
of the guaranty clause.
'We are particular in developing this, history in which
tV.c purpose of the treaty must be sought and the inter
pretation of its text found, because of the vast interest
of ibis city and coast in the construction of the canal.
We v.-j'-h the readers of The Call to know that the steps
taken by the administration are not only essential to the
success of the canal, but have been taken clearly within
our rights to secure that end. While we regret that par
tisan spirit has' appeared to block the way in the Senate,
we are persuaded that such spirit has no. sympathy in
the country. The administration needs to know that its
efforts are indorsed by the commercial interests of this
coast, and we again suggest that our commercial bodies
assert themstlves now, when their influence upon th-
Senatc may be necessary and useful.

tion, but our climate is as constant as t'le sun. The con
ditions which have produced the result are themselves
unchanging, and so must be the result."
It remains to reduce the value of this asset in climate
to terms understood. Mr. G. M. Wooster, director of the
State Board of Trade, does- this in. speaking of irriga
tion." .Irrigation is one of the results of climate. The
climate stores the waterj â¢ the mountain snows and for
ests, and releases it at the precise season when it is
needed. The profit of irrigation, as well as the water- to
supply it, depend on the climate. We needthe equable
heat and dry season of the summer to get the highest
results and profits from the use of water. Our: climate
permits the. growth and gathering of many crops from
the same land in a single season. Mr. Wooster says:
"Three 'million acres in wheat and barley, non-irrigated,
last year produced commercially $22,000,000, while the
product of 300,000 acres . of irrigated land sold for
$50,000,000." â¢
These are facts, such as the State Board collects in
fulfilling; its function of giving reliable statistical infor
mation about the State. What could more startlingly
develop the value of climate as an asset? The climate,
by furnishing water supply and heat and other produc
tive conditions, makes possible the irrigation of the
three million acres which yielded cnly $22,000,000 with
out irrigation. If Olir climatic asset is used, it will be
seen that the three million acres would yield three hun
dred millions -of dollars, and, v added to the product of
the 300,000 acres already irrigated, would make the total
product of three million three hundred thousand acres
of California land $330,000,000 per annum. In that pros
pect what ample scope is offered to the enterprise of the
future !^ Is there a State in the Union, or a country in
the world, that can by reason of its 'assets in climate
offer that certainty to the immigrants who will till the
soil?
The imagination' is always captivated by contempla
tion of gold and silver, and the fancy paints sumptuous
pictures when gold and silver. mines are mentioned. But
the average annual value of gold and silver produced in
the world since 1492 is only $213,000,000. So our asset
in climate in California has put a potential annual value
into the product 'of three million three hundred thousand
acres of land that exceeds the annual average value of
the world's whole product of silver and gold by $ri7,
000,000. Tell this to the world. It. is in figures of money
and not figures of speech.

In his law college, days Prosecuting
Attorney Isidore Harris was the enviÂ«d
of many of his classmates because of
the marvelous capacity he possessed
for absorbing the hard dry stuff in the
books. It is a college legend that Har

Blackstone without an effort end serve
it out to his lecturera and qulzzers as
fast as the questions could be put. Best
of all, Harris wasn't' a 'bit mean In
classroom and if a fellow student was
caught he was always ready to supply
an answer. It got to be a common oc
currence for the boys to depend on
Harris.
But one day Harris and his well-in

Somers was standing a "quiz" before
Judge Charles W. Slack. Slack was a
bit hazy that day and was floundering:
about as best he could.
"Now. Mr. Somers, what is a leading
question?" queried Judge Slack.
"One that can be answered by *ye3'
or 'no,' blithely replied Somers.
"No, no." excitedly whispered Harris.
"One that suggests the answer."
Unfortunately, In his haste Harris
had raised. his voice too high. Every
student in the classroom heard the
correction. Somers hesitated, looked
at Professor Slack and waited.
""Well, well, Mr. Somers," added
Judge Slack. 'The one who suggested

gagement of her daughter Nanette to
Mr. Henry Morgenthau.
the pending of the divorce proceed
ings and although he had a letter
from her inviting him to call, he was
refused admittance. This refusal
continued until he threatened to take
legal proceedings to see hia client. He
demanded that he be allowed to see
Mr*. Anthony alone and this permis
sion was reluctantly given him. Car
penter's testimony was introduced to
show that Mrs. Anthony was unduly
influenced by the husband.
The plaintiff rested and an adjourn
ment was taken until : Monday.
Attorney Carpenter then took the
stand and testified that he had at
tempted to see Mrs. Anthony during
"While talking with him," said Dr.
Lux. "Dr. Anthony said the woman
was non compos mentis. Mrs. An
thony evidently . understood what he
said, as she turned to me and said:
'Dr. Lux, do you think I am insane?'
and I replied: *I don't think .so."
"Whereupon she said:, 'I would like
you to give me a certificate to that
effect.' Upon leaving the room I ask
ed Dr. Anthony whether he could
classify her form of insanity and he
said he could not."
Upon being recalled to the stand
Mrs. Anthony testified that she was
made to believe by her husband that
he could obtain a divorce from her on
the evidence that she was in a man's
room in Chicago. She said she was
unfamiliar with the laws of this coun
try and relied on the statements.
The witness swore that some of Jhe
statements in the affidavit, signed at
the request of her husband, were un
true. Attorney Savage made her ad
mit that she knew what she was sign-
Ing and that she was not coerced. He
proved that no pressure was brought
to bear upon her and that she signed
the affidavit asking Judge Hebbard to
grant the divorce.
The question as to her conduct as
a wife was put to the witness very
pointedly by Mr. Carpenter. - "As a
matter of fact, Mrs. Anthony, were
you guilty of infidelity?"
"No, sir; never," replied the witness
with vehemence.
he did not use violence on the street,
but did use persuasion. She, said the
doctor walked with her ten blocks in
order to persuade her not to visit the
home of her counsel.
The witness left the stand in order
that Dr. Frederick W. Lux might be in
terrogated in behalf of the plaintiff.
The witness said he visited Mrs. An
thony in the St. Helena sanitarium
in response to a letter from her. He
said he found the patient much
wrought up and suffering from low
ered will power. He suggested light
diet and Dr. Anthony, who was pres
ent, talked cuttingly about the ethics
of the medical profession. Witness
said he then informed the husband
that he appreciated the ethics of the
profession and had not intruded by
his own desire, but In response to a
letter from Mrs. Anthony.

The Chinese Presbyterian schools
he!d their Christmas exerc'ses and
Christmas tree festival last night at
the First Presbyterian Chinese Church
at Sll Stockton street. The edifice was
crowded to the doors with curious and
intensely interested Chinese men,
women and children.
The following schools took part in the
exercises: The First Presbyterian
Church School, Evening School for
Men, Sunday-school, Infant Depait
ment. Mission Home of 920 Sacramento
street. Occidental School and the Clay
street Chinese Kindergarten. An ex
cellent programme was arranged and
its execution by the Chinese young and
old folks was e:uremely fascinating.
The audience enjoyed every number
and applauded in true American fash-
Ion. The church was prettily decorated
and next to the altar stood a beautiful
Christmas tree, laden down with gifts
for the women and children. The even
ing passed merrily away. Lattle Chi
nese tots got upon the stage and re
cited pieces in the English language in
a manner that was surprising and re
fiected gTeat credit on their educators.
The feature of the entertainment was
the choir composed whelly of Chinese
men and women, who sang so well that
one was compelled, out of sheer cu
riosity, to look again to see if the sing
ers were really of the Chinese race.
After the programme was completed
the presents were distributed. Not only
did the little ones and the children of
the schools receive some of Santa
Claus* goodness, but a vast number of
presents were distributed among many
heathen women, who were largely rep
resented there. The gifts were the do
nations of the Presbyterian churches of
the State.
The entertainment was given under
the direction of Rev. Dr. I. M. Condlt
and wife, who control the Chinese
Presbyterian church.
The programme was as follows:

CHARMING YOUNG WOMAN
WHO WAS PRESENTED TO
SOCIETY YESTERDAY.
Warrants were secured from Judge
Cabaniss on April 20 last and Dr.
Thrasher and Mrs. Funke were arrest
ed on the charge of selling a human
being. The case3 were dismissed on
May 5 on the ground that the corpus
delicti had not been proved. The prose
cution could not obtain the attendance
of Mrs. Beaglehole to give her testi
mony.
Since then Mrs. Fiest has obtained a
divorce from her husband and was
given the custody of the child, a" girl
now two years and two months old.
P*iest and his wife became reconciled
and she wanted to regain possession
of the child. She discovered that It had
been sold to a Mrs. Beagtehole, a .mil
liner, in Reno, Nev... the consideration
being JS5. The sale was effected by Mrs.
Funke through Dr. Marion Thrasher
of the " Donohoe building. Owing to
Mrs. Beaglehole's mistreatment of the
child, it was taken from her and given
to a family in Watsonville. where it was
recovered through the efforts of M. J.
White, secretary of the California So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children. .
A warrant was issued yesterday by
Police Judge Cabaniss for the arrest
of Clay H. Fiest, a motorman with the
Oakland Transit Company, on a charge
of child stealing. The complaining wit
ness Is Mrs. Laura 'Stoermer, 527 1-2
Birch avenue, sister of Fiesfs divorced
wife. Fiest is accused of stealing his
own child on Tuesday while the Iittje
one was in the care of Mrs. Stoermer.
The issuance of the warrants recalls a
sensational case that occupied the at
tention of the courts about seven
months, ago. Fiest and his wife had
been living apart and she, not being
able to take proper care of the child,
gave it into the keeping of Mrs. Eme
llne Ftinke, a midwife in Alameda. on
June 25, 1902. She promised to procure
a home for it.
Desertion is also charged in the di
vorce action commenced by Frank J.
Kreamer against Annie Kreamer. They
were married at Albuquerque in 1S30. .
Judge Hebbard annulled the marriage
of Elizabeth Kuenzel to H. E. Floyd
because at the time it was solemnized
at Marysville a few months ago she
was not divorced from William Kuenzal
the year the law reauires.
Interlocutory decrees or divorce were
granted to Edward L. Preston from
Mary L- Preston for desertion. Harriet
G. Meyer from Hose Meyer for neglect,
Mary Marum from Thomas Marum for
neglect, Andrew Tidell Jr. from Erne
Tidell for desertion* Isabella Williams
from Richard S. Williams for desertion
and Helen E. Davenport from W. A.
Davenport for intemperance.
Desertion is alleged in the c<" naplaint
for divorce tiled by Chella D. Garratt
against Milton D. Garratt of the firm
of W. T. Garratt & Co. They were
married at Chicago in May of iast year.
In November of last year Mrs. Garratt
sued her husband for support, claim
ing that he had abandoned her.
Thereupon Judge Graham ordered
the petition dismissed and consigned
the little ones . to the care of their
father, who, since he secured a divorce
last December, has kept the children
in a charitable Institution.
Police Otacer Charies B. Wedekind,
who is the defendant in a suit for di
vorce brought by Elizabeth Wedekind.
did not contest the suit. His default
was entered and Judge Mura^ky grant
ed Mrs. Wedekind a decree. She tes
tified that Wedekind wantedxher to
live on Third street in a room not fit
for habitation.
Helene Ericksen is the lawfully
wedded wife of Hans Pettersen. It was
so decided yesterday by Judge Gra
ham, who refused to grant the woman's
suit for the annulment of her mar
riage on the ground that what: it took
place in Sweden several year3 ago she
was under eighteen years of age. The
records offered in evidence in the case
showed that she had reached her ma
jority when she became Pcttersen'a
bride.
Clorinda Faccini begged for a word
of love or a sign of affection from her
four little children in Judge Graham's
court yesterday. She was anxious to
show the court that the little ones loved
her and would be happy with herâ if
the Judge would modify the decree of
divorce in which they were awarded to
the custody of their father, David
Faccini. But she begged in vain. " The
little ones turned their tig brown eyes
toward her, but vouchsafed rot a word
nor a look that would satisfy the long
ing in their mother's heart. Even
Judge Graham, try as he would, could
not get the little ones to express any
love for their mother.
"Do you love your mother?" he asked
repeatedly.
"No," was the answer invariably re
turned by the children, the oldest of
whom is a boy of about eleven and the
youngest a girr whose head reached but
little above the Judge's knee.
"There have beÂ«n a gTeat many re
marks that have not only annoyed the
witness, but counsel as well," said Mr.
Carpenter.
Attorney Savage was quick to inform
the ccrurt that he was not aware of
the laughter, and the court softly asked
counsel to proceed, as he did not think
it would occur again.
*"It is not right for them to do so,"
said Mrs. Anthony, with a sob in her
voice. "They are among friends, and I
em alonÂ» and have to defend myself."
The witness tertifled that the doctor
bad entreated her to pursue the
course she had relative to the 4ivorcÂ«
proceedings. She said that Dr. An
tbony prevented her from leaving the
house; that her wrists were blue from
strugsIirLg with him, and that her
children and llr. Siverson had watch
ed the struggles. Mrs. Anthony said
WOMAN" RKPRI3L\XDEl>.
"Why was it necessary for a divorce
to be granted if you were to remarry?"
"My impression was that Dr. An
thony had so much trouble tret he was
unbalanced. I thought it b-ifcc to do
anything he wished to please him."
At this juncture the witness turned
to Judge Hebbard and whispered, "Is
it right for ladies to laugh in the court
room?** Sho asked this question be
cause friends of Dr. Anthony seated in
the courtroom repeatedly smiled a.nd
laughed at her replies.
Jadpe Hebbard said it was rot verv
proper, and turning to the ladies sug
gested that they retain their smile's un
t.I tbc evidence was all In, for they an
noyed the witness.
"Yes, *ir; when I fell on my kne?s
and appealed to him. I was a proud
weman and I did not want to be sepa
rated frcm my children."
"Now, Mrs. Anthony, did you rely on
that promise?"
"To some extent I did."
"Did he premise to marry you after
he obtained the decree of divorce?"
ii5ked Attorney L. G. Carpenter.
"Since the divorce was granted he
has asked me a number of times. He
said once that after we left for Soutn
Atrica there would be no need of re
marriage, as we would live together as
husband and wife â that there was no
such thing as divorce."
PRO3IISED TO RE3IARRY HER.
'Did he make such promise to you
during the rending of the action for di
vorce?" asked Attroney Savage fcr thÂ«
defense.
Mrs. Christina Anthony says she was
actuated by four motives in signing the
affidavit prepared by her husband's at
torney requesting Judge Hebbard to
grant her husband a divorce from her
en the ground of desertion. These mo
tives, she says, were, first, to prevent
her husband from -bringing an action
against her on the ground of infidelity;
second, to save him from being prose
cuted for perjury: third, to prevent her
children frcm being taken from her,
and because her husband promised to
remarry her at the end cf six menths
:' she would live a chaste life.
The witness asserted that the doctor
promised to remarry her. and especially
after her fronds came to her assist
ance to save her from the harsh treat
ment she alleses she received at the
hands of her husband. The promises
vner* made both before and after the
divorce.
"When Try friends cane to my as
sistance." sh-? swore yesterday, 'I was
more anxious to stand by him than at
any other time."

FAMOUS CAPTAIK OF CAR
LISLE INDIANS AND THE
TEAM AT PRACTICE.
All cheap selling races should be
claiming races, and the jockey club
makes a mistake in not conditioning
them so. The exception should be only
In high class selling affairs.
Little Anderson rides a fair race over
a distance for a beginner. .He piloted
Silver Fizz in the last event, which
mare was played from 12 down 'Â¦â¢ to Â» 4.
The pace was slow enough to give -one
of Superintendent Bill Fieldwick's har
row horses an outside chance.

there returning after the races
The opening of Ascot Park to-day at
Los Angeles makes little impression on
the local game. Twenty-seven books
the largest number in several seasons,
cut in at Ingleside yesterday. This
does not include two field books and
one combination book.
Joe Yeaeer has wired his agent to
have Arthur Redfern. the jockey, re
pc-rt at Ingleside for duty. Redfern is
now at Los Angeles. Yeager is due
here to-morrow.
Tommy Burns was originally en
gaged to ride Position. Tommy had to
quit the track early to enable him to
catch the Owl for Los Angeles and
never knew what he missed.
Bummer warmed up sore, and if a
horse could not run over the track in
its condition yesterday he looks a poor
betting proposition in future.
Willie Haack is riding in excellent
form. He landed Ada N in front and
was placed *in three other events.
Tommy Burns, accompanied by Les
lie Cog&in. left for Los Angeles last
evening. Tommy will ride The Fog and
F. E. Shaw at Ascot Park to-day, re
turning in time to ride in the Christ

ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
In the opening six-furlong selling
eprint, with a field of eleven starting.
Ouatre was installed favorite and ran
a truly refreshing race. Hlldebrand
had the filly in a good position on the
back stretch, where she seemed to be
only galloping, but in the run home
was carried out on the undertow. Foley
pot away first with Sterling Towers, a
10 to 1 shot, and was not headed, beat
ir.g Sir Preston a neck. Elfin King ran
a fair third.
Misty's Pride, the "Queen of the Jun
plesÂ» defeated quite a collection of
t-pee'd in the third event, a five furlong
dash The Oregon-bred trick was 3
and. 4 to 1 in the betting and early as
suming the lead reached the wire a
length before Americano, the Baldwin
entry, a 15 to 1 fhot. The latter was
the contender throughout. Pierce J..
a 30 to 1 outsider, was third. Bummer
ruled favorite, but was sore and. after,
displaying an inkling of speed, dropped
back.
On paper Constellator looked a good
thing for the mile and fifty yard selling
Dumber, still 12 to 5 was obtainable
about the Keatinp entry. Hildebrand
had the leg up and, getting away well,
it proved only a breeze for the Brutus
gelding.
LIXARS DISAPPOINTING RACE.
Willie Haack landed the 30 to 1 shot
Arthur Ray in the place, a neck before
I O U. Lunar, with Oliphant in the
Fiddle, came in for steady support,
but rsna disappointing race.
A new comer in the game, Ada N.,
captured the seven furlong run. fifth
to be decided. The mare opened at 8.
but cieated no stir in ring circles and
the price went to 8 and 10. The race
had a most open look, lllowaho, Mee
hanus and Bill Massie. all being listed
Â£t about the same price. Bill Waldo
on Diderot cut out the running for the
Lunch until the stretch was reached.
Then Haack let out his wraps on Ada
N. and she downed the pacemaker with
*ase. Bill Massie and lllowaho both
ran miserable races.
A ragged bunch of canines lined up
in the concluding mile and a sixteenth
selling fixture. Kitty Kelly closed
*>qual favorite with Position. The
former showed some epeedL, even if she
did run only third, but Position could
not raise a frallop. The winner turned
up in Silver Fizz, a 5 to 1 chance, which
finished a head in front of Frank
Woods at the wire.
The entire card wore an uncertain
look and favorites were knocked down
with great regularity. Constellator, at
3 to 1. i mild public choice, was the
only one to win.
The crack Burns & Waterhouse colt
Rockaway is rapidly being shorn of
his peacock feathers, for twice within
a period of five days has he been de
feated when an odds on favorite in the
betting. At Insleside yesterday the
eon of Colonel Wheeler .was held a 3
to 10 chance. With Tommy Burns on
his back, he was outfooted through the
stretch and was beaten half a length
in the two-year-old event by Mendon,
an S to 1 shot, ridden by Foley.
During no part of the running did
the favorite's chances look any too
rosy, for Burns was hard at Â¦work on
him from the start. Now he has been
placed on the false alarm list, but it
is more than probable the slow track
was pot to his liking or else he is in
reed of a vacation. Instructor finished
third in the race at odds of 100 to 1.

Arrangements were comoleted yes

Indians, to be played at Salem on'Jan
uary' 4- " Reliance plays its â¢" annual
game with Multnomah at Portland on

have been filed at headquarters that it
has not been in use to any visible ex
tent. \
Before the last permit was granted to
the Sequoia Club its representatives
appeared before the Police Commission
ers and declared that It was a bona
fide athletic club. It was explained
that Bishop was acting as the club's
matchmaker. .Yet Bishop appeared the
night of the last fight as Woods' man
ager and chief second.
Mayor Olney's opposition to the con
tinuance of the contests is based en
tirely on his unwillingness to allow such
frequent affairs as the three clubs can
give. He considers that the West Oak
land Club, beyond question ,a legitimate
athletic organization, and the Reliance
Athletic Club were sufficient. But hÂ»
has not been able to make up his mind
to discriminate against any applicant
and therefore his Honor has taken the
flat stand against the continuance r'
the sport.
The proposed boxing bout between
Harry Foley and Jim Scanlan, which
was to have taken place before the Re
liance Club on January 6, has been de
clared off. Foley wants Scanlan to
scale 165 pounds. The latter claims the
best he can do Is 170 pounds. It is pos
sible Scanlan and Joe Millet, who is
coming to the front rapidly, may meet
before the Colma Club.
Foley-Scanlan Fight Is Off.
The Reliance team^enowed up half
an hour later yesterday than their pros
pective opponents. The Caucasians
caught punts for a time and then went
through signal ' practice, as had the
aborigines. Reliance has plenty of ma
terial and will send a strong eleven
Into the big game. Yesterday the Cali
fornians went through their' routine
work with great speed and accuracy.
Their lice averages more than 200
pounds and the team will outweigh the
opposing force by nearly twenty-five
pounds a. man. Reliance has an ag
gregation of stars of the first magni
tude and there will be some sensational
individual plays, by the whites, In the
game to-morrow.
What Reliance lacks most is team
play. ..The men have not practiced long
enough together' to secure the best re
sults, nor have, they had sufficient
training to 'get into, condition that will
permit" them to 'play as fast as they
might otherwise. Â¦
It is sure to be a great game. The
field is in ideal shape and if' it does
not rain before the 'game neither side
can justify itself by explanations after
the contest Is over. Arrangements are
being made at the grounds to accom
modate an immense crowd of specta
tors.' The advance sale of tickets is
heavy.
The officials' have not as yet been se
lected. , Mills, of this year's Harvard
team, happens to be in the city, and
he is likely to be requested to act- as
either referee or umpire. Another Har
vard alumnus, Reid of the Belmont
school, may also be invited to officiate.
Major' Collins of the . same institution
has been suggested as another likely
man for one of the important official
p'ositions.
Reliance will probably take a little
practice to-day, but it will be light.

Nlkofer Shouchuk, Carlisle's Eskimo
center, was of particular interest to the
spectators yesterday â mostly because
he is the only member of his race on a
football team. He laughs all the time,
as if the whole world were one big
joke. He is a solid little fellow, how
ever, and plays the game as if he had
inherited a talent for.it. Hauvermann
may*expect some trouble from him Fri
day afternoon.
S Charles Dillon, left guard, was also
closely inspected by, those who watched
the practice. He is the tricky lad who
hid the pigskin under his sweater In
the game with Harvard and ambled
100 yards down the field for a touch
down. It was related yesterday that
the eleven with the crimson hosiery
was asking for a microscope to find
the ball while Dillon was accumulating
that five points.

ESKIMO EXCITES CURIOSITY.
The strenuous redskins of the Carlisle
eleven and the Californlan gridiron
veterans who are to meet them in the
big game Christmas day were all out
for a good, hard practice yester
day afternoon on the Richmond
field: Eoth teams caught punts
and ran through their signals for
about two hours. When it was all
over .and the athletes were trotting
back to their dressing rooms the spec
tators did not dare to pick a winner.
The Indians put in appearance about
3 o'clock and went to work imme
diately. Coach Warner let his men
warm up by catching punts and falling
on the ball. Then they got into forma
tion and went through the signals for
routine play. Every man on the eleven
handles the ball in splendid shape and
if. the field i3 dry Christmas day the
Reliance team cannot expect to gajn
any ground as a result of furnbliog by
its opponents.
Despite their long trip across the con
tinent the aborigines are in the best
of condition. They are as active as
cats. There is no wait between plays,
for an soon as the ball is down the line
is ready for another rush. The quarter
gives his signals and puts the ball in
play in an amazingly short space of
time. The ends go down the field on
punts like a pair of comets. No one
has to hunt up* the center to 'give him
the ball. The backs start- like ten-sec
ond men.
It has been many a moon since the
California palefaces have seen such
team play. For straightaway, machine
football the copper-hued boys of Car
lisle are about as near perfect as they
make them. Coach Warner says this
team is superior to the one he brought
to the coast four years ago.

The Mayor thus expressed himself
concerning the strongly current rumors
at the City Hall that soon after the
holidays the boxing contest ordinance
will be repealed. "While Mayor Olney
pays he has received no intimation as
to the City Council's possible attitude
toward the recently enacted law, there
is no doubt that pressure is being
brought to bear at the City Hall to in
duce early repeal of the law.
Whence the influence i3 being exerted
has not definitely appeared. "W. B.
Fawcett, the Mayor's secretary, said
this afternoon:
"It looks very much as if the boxing
ordinance will be repealed and. In fact,
I expect to see the Council take that
action after the holidays. It does not
appear where the attack on the ordi
nance Is coming from, but there is an
opposition being manifested."
Behind the stir that has been made is
a story that the city officials would
have been content to allow the two
Oakland clubs, the Reliance and the
"West Oakland organizations, to con
tinue their monthly exhibitions without
disturbance. The Reliance Club con
fined itself to a main event of fifteen
rounds by professionals and a couple
of four or six round curtain raisers.
At the West Oakland Club the pro
grammes have Included four, five or six
four-round contests between amateurs.
Each club has a large following and
almost without exception the monthly
affairs have been more than satisfac
tory to those who enjoyed this form of
sport.
But into the fighting game came the
Sequoia Club, an organization which
has had much difficulty in establishing
its status as a genuine domestic, incor
porated athletic club, as contemplated
under the ordinance. The Sequoia Club
first appeared last March before the
contests were stopped and gave an al
leged fight at Dietz's Opera-house that
did not prove to be satisfactory. After
the -ordinance was signed, the club was
granted a permit In October, but one
of the principals failed to show and
again the club was in bad odor. Then
"Biddy" Bishop, an itinerant manager
of pugilists, sliowed as matchmaker for
the club and he handled the Woods-
Reilly fight last week.
It is the Sequoia Club that is the
disturbing element. There is a grave
doubt in the minds of some city of
ficials that the organization meets the
requirements of the ordinance. It ha3
a very limited amount of apparatus and
practically no gymnasium, using old
Dietz's Hall as its club rooms.
The police have kept a watch on the
hall to discover whether it was in ac
tual service as a club room, and reports
"I shall hot vote to grant any more
permits to conduct boxing contests,"
said Mayor "Warren Olney to-day.
"There are entirely too many of these
affairs going on in Oakland. One a
week or thereabouts is simply creating
a Mecca for the bruisers in this city,
and that is a very undesirable situa
tion."

HAVANA CIGARSSAN JOSE, DÂ«c. - 23.â An open verdict was
rendered In the case of thÂ« Italian found dead
In the htUa;near Morgan HtU yesterday, al
though Indications point to a suicide. D?ath
was due to Â» gunshot wound In the throat.
It is reported that Jonathan Hutchin
son has said that "when a man sneezes
heartily he may know himself to be in
the best of health," and that "no person
In poor health was ever known to
sneeze." The Scientific American, refer
ring to this reported statement, falls
foul of the English surgeon for making
so dogmatic an asertion when the fton
trary is so easily proved. The Journal in
question then goes on to relate many old
superstitions with regard to the ill luck
attending sneezing, some of which, while
proving nothing, are interesting.' It a.p
pcars that many savage, and. semi-civil
ized races of the Orient have, some curi
ous customs regarding the sneeze. When
the Sultan of Monomtopa sneezes, for in
stance, the fact is made known from his
palace by a certain signal. Instantly
every subject within hearing of Â¦ the sig

SALT LAKE, Dec. 23.â On account of
the peaceful, condition of affairs in the
Carbon County coal district/ two com
panies of militia were to-day relieved
of further active duty and ordered
home.

At an early hour this morning Louis
Eratziatino, an Italian laborer, was
ambushed and fatally shot by Louis-
Oreo in front of the latter's home at
2160 Glen avenue. Oreo stood behind j
a tree when he flred the shots and
made his escape when his victim, with
two bullet wounds in the neck, .fell
to the pavement.
Just what caused the shooting the
police have been unable to ascertain,
except that it was the result of a row
the two men had earlier in the evening.
Captain Peterson and a posse of offi
cers are searching for the would-be
murderer, but as yet have been unable
to locate him. /
Oreo,. who is also a laboring men. re
sides with his wife and family at the
house in front of which the tragedy
happened. Eratziatino has recently
been making his home at the same
place and the two were presumed to be
fast friends. Something happened to
sever their friendship last night and
a row was the result. From this point
mystery, which the* officials have yÂ« ;
been unable to unravel, arises. The
members of the family will not talk
and their neighbors, who are of the i
same nationality, remain silent.
Soon after midnight two reports of
a pistol were heard and when the po
lice arrived on the scene" Eratziatino
was found on the sidewalk, bleeding
from two wounds in the neck. He
was removed to the Fabiola Hospital, j
where the physicians pronounced his
injuries fatal. Captain Peterson, on
learning that the assassin had made i
his escape, picked a posse of men and
started for the seen*. Peterson found
that Oreo had stood behind a tree di
rectly in front of the house and fired
as his victim passed. Where the men
were after the trouble^ happened early
in the evening or what occurred be
tween them could not be ascertained.

CHICAGO. Dec. 23.â The Grand Jury
to-night voted indictments against four
men prominent in labor circles- They
are J. E. Johnson, business agent Brass
"Workers* Union; L. E. Fisher, secre
tary International Order Machinists;
R. S. Crane, business agent Interna
tional Order of Machinists, and James
L. Lamb, business agent International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
The indictments voted charge conspir
acy to wreck the business of the Kel
logg Switchboard and Supply Company
during a strike which was productive
of much violence during the early
spring. Testimony was presented tÂ©
the- Grand Jury to the effect that the
four accused men had visited officials
of the Kellogg Company and threat
ened to interfere with the business of
the concern unless the company came
to terms with it3 employes.
While indictments were votÂ«d
against these men the Grend Jury re
fused to return a tree bill against
Charles F. Lang, foreman of a local
printing house, who shot and killed
Emil Reichow, a picket allied with the
striking press feeders of the Franklin
Union. Lang was himself a union man
and was assaulted *by a mob of which
Reichow was one. He fired one shot,
which struck Reichow and caused his
death. Lang established a clear case
of self-defense.
"Do we still sell the old fashioned
family Bible, with pages in it for the
record of births, deaths arfd mar
riages? Oh, yes."' said the book
seller, "but not so many of them as
we once did.
"There are more Bibles sold now,
taking them all together, than ever
before, and the Bible is issued now
in an almost endless variety of forms
and styles; but the demand for it in
this particular form i3 now, I should
say, not more than one-third what it
once was.
"Still, we keep these record Bibles
to-day in a dozen styles, ranging in
price from $5 to $20. The blank rec
ord pages, these often illuminated,
are bound in between the testaments.
-In some of these Bibles there is
a blank presentation page upon which
may be written the name of the per
son to whom the Bible is presented,
with the name of the giver; and in
some of them is contained a blank
marriage certificate; and in some of
them are bound in with the pages for
the record of births, deaths and mar
riages pages for the record of tem
perance pledges. _ >
"These Bibles are more likely to be
bought nowadays by country people,
and it might be by people of the Ger
man race and by. Irish Protestants;
all likely to be substantial people of
comfortable means; conservative peo
ple who cling to time honored cus
toms.
"So, while the old time family rec
ord Bible, with pages for the record
of births, deaths and marriages, has
gone somewhat out of fashion and is
not sold to the extent to which it once
was, yet it is still sold, and the de
mand for it is stlU considerable. â

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 23.â Thomas
Mack, a plumber, whose home is in
Hollywood, is lying at the Receiving
Hospital suffering from a fracture of
the skull. He fell from the roof of a
two-story building on North Main
street this afternoon, and for a time it
v.-as thought that his injury was sus
tained wholly by accident. Investiga
tion by several detectives, however,
leads to the conclusion that Mack was
a victim of attempted murder, that his
injury was sustained as a result of a
blow from a chair and that when ho
fell he was in a dazed condition and
was trying to escape from his assail
ant.
During a lucid interval to-night Mack
stated to the officers that he had gone
to a room in the Grand Central Hotel,
accompanied by a man named S. A.
Parker, to see a woman friend. As
soon as he entered the room he was
struck twice from behind, and then he
remembered no more until he was
crawling from a window to the roof of
the adjoining building. When he tried
to reach around the corner of the
building to a window his hand slipped
and he fell fortv feet to the street,
striking J. R- Vogle, a well-known
druggist. Vogle broke the force of
Mack's fall and prevented his death.
Mack had entered the hotel early in
the afternoon, accompanied by a young
man supposed to be Parker. Nothing
was known of the fight in the room
and no trace of Parker can be found.
An examination of the room showed
that it had been the scene of a des
perate struggle. Blood was spattered
over the walis and a broken chair
showed what Mack had been struck
with. The detectives believe Mack was
a victim of the "badger" game, but
they have been unable to find those
who assaulted him. He has about an
even chance of recovery.

CASE PUZZLES
THE OFFICERS
Manager- of United Railroads
Intimates That Threatened
Demands for More Pay and
Other Concessions Will Fail
"The United Railroads has always f?n
fieaTcred to meet its men in a broad
spirit of fairness. The. twenty-five-cect
rate prevailing here before the last de
mands were made constituted the high
est rate general in any large city in
America. When the last demand was
made we submitted it to arbitration,
and Mr. Mahon, international president
3f the Carmen's Union, joined Mr.
Straus in raising the rate and creating
a graduated scale of wages, making in
certain instances no change and in oth
ers granting an advance to 26*4 and
27^ cents per hour. The decision signed
5y Messrs. Mahon and Straus expressed
thÂ» belief that the award ought to and
would brinsr about a permanent and
long continued peace. It should do so
in ail good conscience, for the rate is
higher than our former rate, which was
the highest rate paid men on any large
system in cimilar employment."
'"The employer vrho pays the highest
wage?," paid Manager Chapman, "is
entitled to the best service. We are
discharging no nan except for clear
violations of the rules of the company
and not then until after careful inves
tigation, and I cannot conceive how it
may be said that our dismissals are
producing strained relations. There is
a place, somewhere, where this con-
Ftant agitation must stop. The United
Railroads is entitled to a season of in
dustrial p^ace. We have pone as far
as a man can go and preserve his man
hood, and a mistake will be made if in
the sprrnie we are confronted with fresh
demand? ar.d fresh troubles.- Peaceful
methods of securing peaceful ends are
about exhausted and for the sake of
a!l concerned I hope that no one is
looking for trouble.
"I do net ear** to discuss in detail the
dismissals from our railway during the
last year." continued Manager Chap
man, for they are not out of the ordi
nary. But probably some attention
should be ?iven to a charge, publicly
made, that the relations between this
company and its men are strained in
co nseqjienc* of dismissals of employes.
FAIRNESS DESIRED.
Mr. Chapman's* statement followed
the story published yesterday morning
to the effect that dissatisfacion exists
among the members of the union over
the rulings of the board of arbitration
as regards the wage schedule and the
report that has gained wide circulation
that the employes are contemplating
rr.aking formal demand for a revision
of the vage scale and for recognition
of the union in the hiring and the dis
charging of m?n. The latter proposi
tion is said to be the result of the al
leged wholesale discharge of employes
from the company on various pretexts.
but in reality r>ecause of their activity
in the affairs cf the union.
TIRE OF TTR3IOIL.
In language that will not admit of
misinterpretation Manager Chapman
Of the United Railroads yesterday is
sued a statement that can only be ac
cepted in the light of an ultimaum to
the employes of the street railway lines
over which he has supervision. It is of
a defiant character, plainly intimating
that the corporation of which he is
the directing medium is prepared to
meet all future demands of the Car
men's Union with a firmness not here
tofore exhibited by the company in its
dealings with its men in matters per;
taining to thÂ»ir respective interests.
The quartet of criminals then .visited
the boot and shoe store of Max Wolf
at 820 Third street and looted it. They
took goods valued at $50. Then all
trace" of them was lost. The police were
at once notified and detectives started
to work.
Late last night Detectives Graham
and Fitzgerald, who were detailed in
the district, located four men who were
acting in a suspicious manner on Har
rison street and watched them. The
men appeared to be lying in wait for
somebody. A newsboy was then seen
to approach and give a signal to the
men and the four started off. The de
tectives were quickly upon the crowd
and had them* in irons. An old man,
who is supposed to have been another
â¢lookout." was also taken into custody.
At the Central Police Station, to
which the men were taken, it was
found that two of them were the no
torious Stafford brothers, who have
served terms in the penitentiary.
The newsboy also bears an unsav
ory reputation with the police. Some de
tectives "believe that they are the per
sons responsible for the crimes com
mitted on the previous night as well
as others which have recently caused
trouble for the police.
ENTER A SHOE STORE.
liOLD UP A MAX.
In South Park the burglars met Con
stantine Quasdika, who resides at 268
Brannan street. They ordered him to
! throw up his hands, at the same time
i placing two revolvers to his head.
| Quasdika complied with the command
! and two of the men went through his
'â¢ pockets, taking a small amount " of
coin. They then ordered the man to
; walk in the direction of Third street,
while they disappeared in the darkness
of a side street. Regardless of the
fact that the police might be searching
the neighborhood for them, they re
turned to' Brannan street, between
Second and Third, and entered the
Teamsters' Exchange saloon while the
proprietor was drawing a pitcher of
beer for a woman who was waiting
outside. One of the men went behind
the bar. opened the cash register and
pocketed about $28. , The proprietor
turned, but the robbers rushed from
the place and ran toward Third street
Soon afterward the men appeared at
the corner cf Third and Brannan
streets and approached Antone Galicia,
who was standing in front of a saloon.
They demanded money from the man,
but he informed them that he did not
have any. They then asked him to take
them inside and buy them a drink, but
he* repeated his answer that he was
without funds. One of the robbers then
struck him on the head with the butt
end of a revolver, cutting a gash two
inches long. Galjcia fell* to the pave
ment, shouting for help, and his assail
ants ran off. The injured man was
taken to the office of a physician in
the neighborhood and the wound was
stitched.
' About ,10 o'clock. the crooks went t<
the store owned by Niven'& Veeder ai
210 Brannan street and, with the use q!

They entered the store, went to tht
place where the guns were kept anc
secured two revolvers and severa:
boxes of ammunition. They also se
cured other loot, which was not of a
bulky nature. Loading the revolvers
they started for South "Park. Acros;
the street they saw a Greek laborer
whose attention they had attracted,
and who watched as thev committed
the crime. Approaching the man, thej
commanded him to move on, at the
same time striking him on the head
and knocking him down. The victirr
of the assault made his escape as
quickly as possible, but was too fright
eced to hunt for the police In the vicin
ity until some time .afterward,
Four desperadoes started cm a tous

record of six daring deeds was soon ii

The victim of one hold-uo was strucl

The proprietors of the bakeries say
they have DO fear of a bread famine^
as many bakers are not participating
m the strike movement. The butchers
and restaurant waiters are holding a
meeting to decide whether or not to
join in the strike. . ..
The bakers this afternoon attempted
' to make a demonstration in front of
the Luxembourg Palace, "where the Sen
: ate "was sitting, but 500 mounted po
: lice took possession of the surrounding
' streets and the Prefect of Police, M.
â¢ Lepine. personally conducted a rigid
j suppression of the disorder. All groups
' of. persons were prevented from gath
ering and a number of arrests were
made. The action of the police com
pletely broke up the demonstration.
j The strikers are gathering for another
I demonstration on the Place de l'Opera,
i where there are dense crowds of holi
i day shoppers. Mo-unted troops and po
j Hoe are preparing to prevent the dem
; onstration.
PARIS, Dec.* 23.â The strike here of
men empltjyed in the various branches
6fÂ» food supplies'"' began to assume se
rious proportions to-day. The bakers
assembled .at the Labor Exchange and
adopted resolutions favoring a strike
throughout the baking trade to begin
to-day, declaring in favor of a general
strike in all branches of the trade and
announcing their intention not to re
sume work until Parliament suppressed
the municipal r employment agencies.
The indications are that a 'considerable
number of "butchers, grocers and pastry
cooks will take part in the strike.-
Anticipating demonstrations, the mil
itary and police have taken elaborate
precautions. Large forces of guards
are held ready at the various barracks
and many police are oa duty around
the exchange. Many, thousands of bak
-ers are parading the streets. .
The city has taken on a martial ap
pearance. Squadrons of mounted troops
and police are stationed on. the main
squares and in the principal thorough
fares.
CHICAGO, Dec. 23.â The struggle be
tween the liverymen's and und ?rtaker3"
associations and the drivers' union,
which for the lasf few days has serious
ly interfered with the trtirial of, Chi
cago's dead, as no hiarses or carriages
have been available for funerals, is to
be a figrht to a finish, alj efforts looking
to a settlement of the strike by concili
ation having been abandoned to-nigrht.
For the last two days the prospects for
a settlement by arbitration seemed
bright, but to-day the contending par
ties drifted farther apart than ever and
all i>eace negotiations have been de
clared off by the employers.
At a meeting to-night of the employ
ers affected hy the strike it was decided
to open for business to-morrow morn
ing on the "open shop" principle and
employ union or non-union men. Be
fore this decision was reached ar
rangements were made to petition one
of the Circuit Court Judges to-morrow
; for an injunction restraining the strik
ers from interfering with the business
! of the employers. The conservative
element at the meeting: worked hard
to prevent the opening of the stables.
but was defeated. It was proposed to
make overtures to the strikers on an
arbitration basis. This was not given
heÂ«-d by the more radical element,
which expressed itself as being tired
Â¦waiting. The unions predict trouble
v> hen the '"open shop" plan is tried.
In anticipation of opposition by the
unions the employers to-night called
upon Chief of Police O'Xeil for further
police protection against violence and
picketing. In reply Chief O'Xeil said:
"The police have bee n ordered to ex
tend you the utmost protection in car
rying on funerals. If you experience
the slightest trouble call up the nearest
police station, and if that does not heip
call me up."
Chief O'Xeil's plan is to have police
men in cabs accompany all funerals.
Members of the association said to
night that should the police fail to
maintain order the Sheriff would be
called uron for protection, and should
that fail the Governor will be appealed
to to supply militiamen.
The driver of an ambulance which
was taking a body to a train to-day
w;is made the target of abusive epi
thets, and in another instance mourn
ers were delayed by pickets until the
body which they were accompanying
had been placed aboard a train and the
train had left the station.

It took all hands five days to clear the
wreckage, and during the operation the
rolling of the ship kept ih-j swaying
wreckage in constant motion. Axes
and cold chisels 'were plied with grim
industry. Sleep was at a premium and

bank's sailors were tired and dirty and
every man from skipper down bore on
hands and arms cruel scars and bruises
inflicted during the tussle by. the jagged
edges of buckled spar and frayed steel

Captain Henderson declined the ser
vices of a towboat on Tuesday, but
yesterday changed his mind, accepted
the services of a tug and is now safely
anchored off the quarantine station,
where she will remain until I>r. Cum
minjrs. with the aid of scientifically
prepared fumes, succeeds in suffocating
such disease germs as might have
stowed away in the ballast at Shang
hai.
Such repairs as could be made were
effected as well as heavy weather
would permit. Under ordinary circum
stances the bark might have made
Royal Roads with her spars intact, but
November 27, when about 1200 miles
west-northwest of San Francisco, or,
to be exact, in latitude 42.31 north and
longitude 148.17 west, a heavy north
easter was encountered.
The gale found easy prey in the
Olivebank, with her slackened shrouds
and generally strained rigging. The
main topmast came down with a crash
at 1 a. m., bringing with it the main
topgallant mast and all tho rigging.
The m-^sts and most of th Â» gear fell
overboard, but the main yard fell to
the deck, cutting a jagged hole in the
port bulwarks. The fore and mizzen
tops followed in rapid succession, and
within a few exciting moments the
Olivebank was lying helpless in a high
cross sea, dismasted, her decks piled
with junk stripped from aloft and the
wrecked steel spars still suspended by
the dismantled rigging, beating with
fearful force against the vessels sides.
All hands were on deck at the time
and that nobody was killed or even
hurt when that avalanche of spars,
blocks and steel stays crashed from
aloft is strange.
The Ollvebank left Shanghai October
IS, in ballast, for Royal Roads for or
ders. Everything went well until the
bark reached latitude 35.02 north, lon
gitude 154.24 east, which she did No
vember 9. A typhoon from the south
east struck the vessel on this day and
until late November 10 the Olivebank
had a wild time. While the typhoon
lasted the ship rolled heavily. From
port to starboard she wallowed. Down
on one side until the railtoo almost
leveled with the sea's surface, and then
back with a jerk and over on the other
side. As she rolled steel yards swung
and tugged at their fastenings, masts
swayed and the rigging groaned and
creaked at the unwonted strain. The
topmast rigging started and when the
typhoon had passed the OHvcbank was
in need of considerable overhauling
aloft. \_
bank, which was sighted on Tuesday
off the Farallones, was towed into port
yesterday by the ' tug Sea King and
later taken by the Dauntless to the
quarantine station, where her ballast,
taken at Shanghai, will be fumigated.
The vessel will be releassd to-day,
when representatives of th-e under
writers will inspect the battered hull
and count the cost of the Olivebank's
encounter with the elements.
The dismasted British bark Olive-
General W. T. Clark of the United
States Internal Revenue Department
at Washington, D. C, arrived in this
city yesterday morning and entered
upon on official inspection of the rev
enue office in this city. At all former
inspections during the incumbency of
John C. Llynch the office has been
rated Al.

Miss Caroline Lee of the Chinese
Methodist Home. The presentation
took place in the rooms of the Chinese

HELENA, Mont., Dec. 23.â The State
concluded its side of the Gravelle case
to-day and the defense will begin the
introduction of testimony Saturday, the
trial being continued* till that time.
Another witness testified to-day that
Gravelle told him of his dynamiting
operations and this witness brought
other threatening letters out of jail
written by Gravelle since his arrest.
This witness was John Reardou, a man
who was confined in the County Jail,
where he gained the confidence of Gra
velle. Two of these letter^ were to
the railroad people, one to th>; Northern
Pacific and the other to the Great
Northern, while one of the other letters
threatened the jury. Another was to
an acquaintance directing him what
to swear to and to deliver the jury
letter to its foreman.
Chief Special Agent McFYtridge of
the Northern Pacific, who has had
charge of the case and who has gath
ered all of the evidence, wwsj the last
witness. He identified many of the
exhibits used by the State and told
where they had been obtained. He said
that since the arrest of Gravclle there
had been no track disturbancs on the
Northern Pacific. *
The men declare they will not retur
to work until this is granted. The pa;
checks for last month were receive
to-night and are to be distributed i
the morning.
The strikers held a meeting this aft
ernoon and sent a committee to con
fer with Superintendent Burkhalter,
demanding that the company establish
an earlier and regular pay day Instead
of the irregular dates at which, men
say, they have been paid for year a
past. The superintendent expressed a
willingness to take the matter up with
the higher officials and see what could
be done.
BAKERSFIELD, Dec. 23.â The boil
ermakers, machinists and blacksmiths,
to the number of about 200, walked out
of the Southern Pacific Railroad shops
at Kern City, at 11 o'clock to-day, pur
suant to a threat made yesterday tc
Master Mechanic French that if the
pay checks did not arrive by that hour
they would quit work.
The switchmen employed in the rail
road yards at Kern joined the striking
shop employes in the afternoon and
the . work was badly tied up by theii
action.

STATE CLOSES ITS CASE
MEN ABE DISSATISFIE
. John P. Irish, president of the board
of directors Â«f the Industrial Home of
Mechanical Trades for the Adult Blind
at Berkeley, has {submitted to Gover
nor Pardcc a report of that . institu
tion's progress during the year ending
November "0, and some of the infur
hxation furnished is encouraging to all
tvho arc interested in the State's ef
fort to make sightless men and wome"
self -support ing.
Broom making was the principal in
dustry engaged in by the inmates, and
during the year the sale of brooms,
whisks, mattresses, pillows and chair
j-eating brought a cash return of $1S.
313 '.:'. a monthly average of $1528 65.
i^upf rint< ndont Joseph Zanders is large
ly responsible for this excellent show
ing. As the shops were closed during
the administration that preceded the
return of Mr. Sanders to the supcrin
tc&deiH v. in June. lS'.'J. of course the
ir^dc had all been lost and had to be
Bought and recovered again from the
< hannels to which it had been diverted.
Not only was the home under the dis
advantage of lust trade, but Mr. San
ders found its finances burdened by a
deficit of SSS77 40. The institution did
not emerge from these disadvantages
and acquire means t<Â» open the shops
until November 1. KKKt. A statement of
the monthly returns from that date
shoves that the work of blind men and
women has produced in rash the sum
of $41,700 i?> in thirty-seven months, or
an averase of $1127 per month.
"The blind have again become earn
ers," saya the icp<>rt. '"Their wages
are economized in making provision for
their future, and the sting of depend
once is taken out of their lives. This
result is gratifying to the humanity of
the commonwealth, and should maka
( rery Califorr.ian prouder of his State,
which takes the stone of stumbling
from the path of the helpless and un
fortunate blind."
During the year the institution has
been constantly filled with inmates up
to its present capacity, and if all the
qualified were now in its shelter the
number of inmates would be doubled.
It is the opinion of the directors that
the n<-xt Legislature should appropriate
the funds needed to make the home
available to all of its intended bene
ficiaries in the State and also reduce
the risk of life and property caused by
the old and infirm building by replac
ing it v.ith a modern and comfortable
structure.
At the close of the year the home
had 121 inmates. The total expenditure
was $40,329 61.

Chicago Grain Market. -
CHICAGO. Dec. 23â The wheat market was
more or less a one man affair to-day, being to
a !anre extent dependent upon the action of
the bi^ bull interest. The leading long sold
on all sharp rallies, <;nly to buy back 4gaLa en
all breaks. Opening prices were ?tea-1y on small
local rtceipu. May being unchanged to a
shade higher at yil^c to .Â« *i y s^ *a o. ThÂ« big
Ions bought rsenly at the start, but because
two or tfaree arominent commission housjus
were free sellers at the same time the tm
pressicn was created that he was selling more
than he bought. This belief led to a small de
cline. May going down to S24c. Shorts be
came active buyers at this figure and the price
rallied. During the latter Dart of the session
the market developed considerable strength on
advices from Dallas claiming that wheat is
dying all over Texas on account or drouth.
May advanced to i>34c, but heavy realizing
quickly caused a reaction. The close, how
ever, was firm with May 4c higher at S.'JUc.
Corn was influenced by the late strength In
whtat, but ciu: j Â¦:â¢_â¢ of thar 'there was little in
the way of news to affect prices. Closing
prices were firm. May cloac.t at 44 cents.
Fair buying of-oats by cash and commission
house?, together with the strength in wheat,
caused a firm market. The clo?e was firm.
May cicslng at 3"4c.
Provisions ruled strong on a good demand
from commission houses ani local shorts. For
eigners were moderate buyers of tart. May
pork closed .'JO cents higher, lard up 15c and
ribs 124irl5c better.
The leading futures ranged as follows:

WEDNESDAY, Dec. 23.-2 p. m.
The hats woven in one piece, and
which sell here at from 10 cent3 to 30
cents apiece, and the straw hat rang
ing in price from 23 cents to Jl. could
undoubtedly be exported to the United
States to advantage. It is rather
strange that some of our enterprising
hat men have never procured models
from the United States, so that these
various^ classes of hats may be braided
to suit the foreign taste. An order
was received In this city a few day3
since fron> an interior city of the
United States for something like 1000
gross of palm hats, if they could be
produced in the shapes desired. There
is no reason why this trade should not
result in the exportation annually of
hundreds of thousands of gross f^r use
during the hot season in the United
States.â Modern Mexico-.
A line of industry which i3 in its
infancy, but bids fair in the near fu
ture to be of considerable importance.
iÂ§ th? exportation of hats to the Unit
ed States. "While the wool and felt hats
will probably never bet a very impor
tant article of export, as their princi
pal market ia the extreme southwest,
and arnonsr the few who lik? to own
a "real Mexican sombrero," there la a
probability of extending the commerce
in straw and palm hat3 almost indefi
nitely. The finer grades of palm hats,
which are admirably adapted for th*Â»
summer season at seaside and In tha
country and in all picnic and puting
expeditions, can be laid down in the
American market at figures which will
enable them to compete advantage
ously with the various c!asse3 of:
straw ha.ts*in use there. Reference is
made to the classes known as "da
trenza," which rangre In price from Jl
to $20 (Mexican money), according to
the flnenes of the braid and quality of
the t>alm. â¢
Mexican Hats for Export.
There are now very few Cranberries left.
and they are firm and selling well.
[ Trading in fruits was leÂ£3 active than on the
preceding day, as nearly all dealers, whole
salers and retailers alike, were busy with
Turkeys. The Orange market was ta gocd
shape for fancy well colored stock, which
was still scarce. Poorly colored stock con
tinued abundant and moved very slowly at
unsteady prices. The Apple market was rath
er easy but prices of fancy stock were un
changed. Ordinary and medium grades were
offering at easy prices and were in good
demand amons peddlers. Stocks of Persim
mons are- stÂ«Â».iily d*creaslcK and prices have
a narrower range. Â¦ Strawberries arrived rather
freely and gold slowly at $2 BO03 3O per cheat,
and choice Grapes were in igood request at
$1 23Â® I 50 per crate. Trootcal fruits were

Receipts of Produce.
NEW YORK. Dec. 23.â Basing his
opinions upon data collected by several
explorers sent out by Morris K. Jes
sup of this city Dr. Frani Boas, curatsr
of ethnology of the American Museum
of Natural History, has announced his
belief that previous theories as to the
origin x>t the American and Asiatic
tribes around the north pole are found
ed in error. The curator declares that
ihe tribes around the Bering Sea and
east to Greenland are subdivisions off
one race, and that the Esquimau po
sition as a distinct race, so long con
ceded, can no longer be sustained. "It
seems clear," he said, "that the Isolated
tribes of Eastern Siberia and those o2
the northwest coast of America form
one race, similar in type and with many
elements of culture in common. Tha
invasion "of eastern tribes in America
has disturbed the former conditions,
but enough remains to lead us to thinlc
that the tribes of thi3 whole area must
be considered as a single race: or. at
least, that their culture i3 a single cul
ture, which at one time was found in
both the northeastern part of the Old
World and the northwestern part of
the New World."
Heretofore the dwellers of the Arctic
region were believed by many scien
tists to be the oldest existing race and
to be of pre-glaciil origin.

I asked for fancy prime stock, but as receipts
were heavy prices commenced to decline shortly
" after the opening and in the afternoon the best
stock could b*Â» obtained at 23Â§24c. while com
mon and inferior stock was bard to dispose
of at the minimum quotation. . Western chilled
and frozen stoÂ«k was being marketed freely
at &Q23e and this* had a tendency to weaken
the marittt for Californlan. The exact re
ceipts of Cajifomian cculd not be ascertained,
but a conservative estimate placed the amount
- at about 2S0 tons. The market closed rather
weak with a heavy surplus unsold, and there
was little or no buying on speculative account.
as many dealers were holding -eft in. expecta-^
tion of a break in prices. Th^ expectation
will be realized if to-day's receipts are large.

Men of influence are not the only
foreigners who receive the Sultan's at
tention. On the twenty-fifth aniver
sary of his accession to # the throne an
English tradesman who had long sup
plied tl.e palace with its cravats and
smaller sundries of raiment was sud
denly told that the Sultan wished to
know the man who had supplied him
with goods these twenty-five years. The
white-haired Englishman was dragged
from behind his counter, thrust into a
proper suit of broadcloth, and carried
to the palace as "fast as two fresh
horses could take him.'- He shook the
Sultan's hand with unrestrained en
thusiasm, expressing his sense of the
honor in such Turkish as he had
picked up in the course of trade. Then
the Sultan smilingiy expressed' his ap
preciation of the long years of
straightforward, honorable dealing,
and bestow.ed upon the shopkeeper

The police are actively employed at
the present moment in raiding those
wine shops in Paris where betting is
carried on. Innocent-looking wine
shops, these; and innocent looking the
proprietor as he stands behind the
bar serving out measures of thin red
wine, in his shirt sleeves. But his
pockets are full of betting slips, and
his cupboards contain betting books,
and the money passed over the coun
ter is more for betting than drink.
However, the police are a match fpr
the wine seller, and a match for even
less suspicious characters who secret
ly follow the profession of the book
maker. Recently, for instance, they
could not understand- why a certain
concierge received so many visitors,
and was so prosperous. Watched was
the concierge, and one morning he and
his visitors were searched, and the
usual betting paraphernalia was dis
covered. And our concierge was actu
ally attended by a valet and assisted
by a secretary. Among his clients
were a number of well-known and
influential people, and the servants
and small tradespeople of the quarter
deemed it an honor to transact busi
ness with so prosperous and distin
guished a concjerge. Unfortunately,
the fines imposed in such cases are
not severe enough to serve as a warn
ing, and it is hoped that a new law
will shortly be introduced which^wlll
deal sharply with the innocent-fook
ing wine seller %nd his fellow offend
ers. â London News.

The first report has been received
from the members of the expedition of
the Liverpool School of Tropical Medi
cine, which was sent to the Congo Free
State with the co-operation of the King
of the Belgians. Quarters have been
supplied in Borria. and will be provided
in Matadi and Leopoldville by the
State, and the local State physicians
have placed the native hospital, where
there are about ten cases of sleeping
sickness, at the expedition's disposal.
A missionary informed the expedition
that last year 4000 people died from
this disease in the district of Watken,
and it was stated that the depopula
tion of the country was feared near
Bundunda. at the confluence of thÂ«
Kwango and Kassai rivers. Pest
,eamps have been established in various
districts, in accordance with the Gov
ernor's orders, and cases are isolated
in them under the care, of soldiers aa
they occur. The Government hopes
by these measures to check the spread
of the malady.â New York Commer

They have not only gone through
the records of the department, but
have examined a number of* persons in
the department and in the bureau of
engraving and printing, which prints
the stamps, and have examined phil
atelists, including a prominent dealer
in this city, with a view to ascertain
ing the identity of persons who have
sold stamps to the dealers in those
articles. >' "
It has been the practice of the office
for a number of years to distribute
among department officials and other
prominent persons "specimen" stamps,
distinctly so marked to prevent their
use as postage, as an official courtesy,
and it is known that a large, number
of these stamps have found their way
into the hands of the dealers. The in
spectors are endeavoring to find out
who sold them to the dealers. The in
vestigation may be concluded this
week. â Washington Star.

REAL) ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Without going into a scientific dis
sertation on breathing, it may be
stated that the lower portion of the
stomach plays its part in the proces3
of respiration.
Now the ordinary man. says thi3
investigator, allows the lower portion
of the stomach to play too great a
part in the process of breathing,
whereas the corset confines -the
breathinar of the fair sex more largely
to the upper portion of the chest, and
woman retains her crown of glory.
In the pursuit of his investigations
the chemist selected various animals
which breathe properly, and fitted
them with an apparatus which forced
what is called exclusively abdominal
breathing. Dogs, cats and even birds,
fitted with these unique and wrongly
constructed corsets actually lose their
hair or feathers after a few months
of wear!
On the other hand it is argued that
millions of men who do not wear
stays have an abundance of hair.
It has been set forth on competent
authority that at least 50 per cent
of the men of the present day are
more or less afflicted with baldness,
and that the percentage is increasing
alarmingly.
This fact alone rather upsets the
argument that h^s just been set down
and to it must be added the further
fact that thousands of men habitually
wear a belt, not necessarily of leather
or worn outside the waistcoat, which,
although they are unaware of it, acts
as a pair of stays with' regard to the
process of breathing.
From inquiries made in this con
nection the w,eight of evidence is in
favor' of a good head *of hair in the
possession of men who wear these
belts, which are sometimes mere
strips of flannel. â Milwaukee Sentinel.

For the corset has found a friend.
It Is declared to be u certain cure
for baldness by a scientist who will
not be denied, but comes forward with
baldheaded facts. i
He blames baldness on exclusively
abdominal or "deep" breathing, which
men affect, and in which the corset
does not allow women to indulge.

tradesmen gave them a handsome clock
as a wedding present. The Duke heart
ily thanked the representatives of the
donors and expressed tho gratitude of
himself and the Dvfchesa for yester
day's splendid welcome.
Albert William McKowen. self-con
fessed embezzler of funds entrusted to
his temporary keeping as secretary of
the University of California, cut a sor
ry figure when he appeared for ar
raignment yesterday morning In the
court of Justice James J. Quinn-in Oak
land. His week's incarceration had i
shrunken his form and seamed his -face
with care lines, and consciousness of
the disgraceful position he occupied
was reflected in his shifting gaze as he
faced the bench and listened to the
reading of the complaint. His jaws and
chin were covered with a stubbly
growth of whisker, and he bit his
nether lip nervously and fiddled with
his fingers during tho perusal.
After informing him that Albert Wil
liam McKowen was charged by Nor
man McLaren with the crime of felony
embezzlement in having appropriated to
his own use the sum of $3315, the prop
erty of the Regents of the State Uni
versity, the Justice asked the prisoner
if he was the Albert William McKowen
there referred to. and the answer was
an affirmative nod. Then the court in
quired if the defendant had a legal ad
viser, and before a reply could be given
Deputy District "Attorney . Everett
Brown arose and stated that Attorney
Harry M. Wright, representing the de
fense, was ill at his home and unable
to appear, and had requested that the
examination of the accused be set for
January 6, 1901, a proposal which the
State was willing to accept. So the
hearing was accordingly continued. At
torney L. Church represented the
Board of Regents at the arraignment,
but took no active part in the pro
ceedings.
While waiting in the office of the pris
on to be taken to the courtroom Mc-
Kowen assumed an ill-fitting air of
nonchalance. He smoked a cigarette
and gazed listlessly through a barred
window at the street life, seemingly
oblivious to his immediate environment
until an incident occurred that tore
away his mask of pseudo indifference.
A ring of the telephone bell was .re
sponded to by Jailer Harry Clark, and
the ensuing conversationâ from what
could be ascertained by hearing one
side of it â was. evidently an exchange
of holiday greetings between the officer
and a friend. "And amerry Chrtstmas
to _ you", were the words that shattered
McKowen's., false .pretense. They
brought tears to his eyes that could not
be concealed, and- he paced the floor in
apparent agitatjon until Constable Bert
Hem'pstead arrived to escort him to the
tribunal. . . = â¢ j Â¦ ,
When the constable . produced the
handcuffs McKowen started and a glow
of shame suffused his '-features, but he
submitted without- protest to being
manacled to his custodian. The march
to the courtroom' was marked by only
one notable Incident. A- little boy ran
in front of the prisoner and,', laughingly
looking up at his face, piped; "How do
you do, Mr.' McKowen?" With a smile
of recognition McKowen replied. "Very
well, , Willie; how are you?" Then he
informed the officer that the child was
a friend of his. â¢ Â¦ \ .'. .;
W. H. Smyth, with whom HcKowen
has lived ever since he came" to Califor
nia, twenty years ago," was in the court
room, and 'accompanied his" protege
back to the jail, preventing him as
much as. possible from getting within
range of the cameras that awaited him
all along the route. * v ; f ' \ . .

The Dalles before he was retaken.
Small next turned his steps toward
Montana, and after making a search of
that State returned to Seattle and took
a steamer for this city. Accompanying
him on his remarkable pursuit are his
three childrenâ two boys and a girl.
Small plainly stated last night that
he had no intention of harming his wife

From his home town he journeyed to

reach that" town, however, they had
taken their departure, and after hear

that a couple answering their descrip

Finally, thp massive doors of the jury

emnly filed into ihe courtroom of Judge

John J. Caaddy. a. clerk in the claims
department of the- United Railways,
vas thr first witness called by the jury
during their extended session. His
testimony was, in fact, the only evi
dence of importance taken at the ses
sion, and he was closeted with the
jurors for half an hour.
CuHsfdy to!d how he had secured a
position in the office of the County
Clerk soÂ»^n a/tcr the latter took his
Ffat, dunns: the month of January,
1202. Caatfdy Eiate,d that he was to
have received a salary of $150 a month
for his serWws.
1 He -worked in the office but a. month
and two days and left v ithout having
received a .rent for his labor. He
B*<ore that he had no further tran
, saÂ«~tions v.'ith Mahony till the first of
the present 'year, when he was made a
clerk in the office once more, and this
time his was fixed at 5100 a
month.
District Attorney Byinglon was clos
eted with the jury during the greater
pa"rt of th^ session. When the jury
finally deckled' to adjourn tho tip was
passed around thÂ«Â» lobbies that Mahony
had be*n indi'*f>d and that the others
werp snfo for a few davs at least.
But swh was not the situation. "Wb^n
th<Â» Grand Jury had finish?*?, taking the
testimony of John J. C.issidy and
Frank French its members Jiegan their
confultation, which lasted for nearly
two hours. AH the evidence- presented
v &s carefully -weighed and the facts
were considered, and then the secret
indictment xemm -returned before Presid
ing Judge Murisky.
Yesterrlay afternoon tho Crand Jury,
sfter a long and tedious session, re-
Turned an indictment againsr County
Clerk Albert B. Mahony on a. charge of
felony; Contrary to exp>-jrta*.ir>nj:, no in
dictments were issued against Cassidy,
Brady, Pierce or Davidson, though it
is r/robable that they will share the
fete of Mahony when the jury meets
again.
It was known that the indictment
against Mahony would suncly be forth
coming, and when the jury remained in
seFsion for fo long a time the general
opinion prevailed that th<> others whose
rsmfs have boen linked ivith the scan
dals in the office of tho County Clerk
would certainly meet with the same
fate. "
Upon the disappearance of her moth
er Lona, a 16-year-old daughter, con
fided to her father that while at the
hotel Grant had taken advantage of
her. Heart-broken and thoroughly
aroused by what he had learned. Small
determined to â¢ leave no stone unturned
to hunt down the fiend who had ruined
his home, and his wife particularly, in
view of the fact that the latter was at
times subject to dementia.
The injured husband caused to be
printed a circular, of which the follow-
ritory, but rather to persuade her to
break off an alliance that will only end
in disaster. As for the wrecker of a
happy home and polluter of his daugh
ter Small does not say much, but a pe
culiar glitter in his eyes signifies that
if a meeting occurs the crack of the
pistol will be heard.
Small conducts a hotel at Oswego and
his lands cover many acres adjoining
the hamlet. In the early part of De
cember, 1902. John Grant, employed as
a section hand on the railroad, made
his appearance in the town and took
up quarters at the hotel. He was a
pleasant, sociable fellow and readily
made friends. After remaining in Os
wego about two months he removed to
Portland, but often called to see his old
friends, the Smalls. On .^August 13 of
this year Mrs. Small disappeared, and
upon investigating" Small ascertained
that she had eloped with their former
lodger, Grant.
