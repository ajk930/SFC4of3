wi Second Time in Three Years
Flames Leave Company
Without a Pier. %
NEW YORK. July 10.â The new pier of
the Scandinavian-American line at the
foot of Seventeenth street. Hoboken, was
destroyed by fire to-day and for the sec
ond time in three years the line is tem
porarily without a pier. It is believed the
loss will amount to almost $500,000. The
dock alone cost $200,000 to build.
The fire started in the store room of
the pier and when discovered the fire had
& firm hold. There was no ship of the line
In port. The steamship Island should
have dockec u to-day but did not arrive.
On the pier was a liirge part of the
cargo destined for Europe; which was to
be shipped on the Island, and this was
destroyed, causing a loss of over $300,000.
Comparatively few men were at work on
the pier at the time and none was In
lured.

CONSTANTINOPLE. July 10.â Official
r.tws received from Sofia yesterday was
more reassuring. Bulgaria has abandoned
her intention of reinforcing her troops on
the frontier. In diplomatic circles a calm
view of the situation is now taken and it
is believed the storm has passed away.
SALONICA. European Turkey. July 10.
âIn Epite of the reassuring official advices
from Constantinople, the belief prevails
here that war between Turkey and_ Bul
garia' is imminent. Bulgarian bands in
Macedonia are being reorganized under
officers sent from Sofia for use as scouts
and -guerrillas, and a large concentration
or troops is taking place in the hills near
Yenidje, though orders have been issued
to avoid an immediate conflict with the
Turk's, who are concentrating large forces

sometime.- It is 1 expected that the morn-
Ing bulletin will be given out soon. '

DOCTORS AT VATICAN.
1 For this reason no' opposition has ever
been raised by the Italian .Government
when foreign, rulers have visited Rome,
recent- examples being, the calls made on
"In view of the conditjon of the Pope,
which occasions deep suspense through
out the Catholic world, the visit of King
Victor Emmanuel to France has been
postponed until next September by a
common accord between the French and
Italian governments." ;
The report has reached here from.Ber
lin that Emperor William has expressed
an intention '. of , attending the Pope's
funeral. As the French papers have com
mented on this; news, saying that the
Emperor's action would offend the Ital
ians, it may -be as 'well to say that no
body here believes the report. '. :_Â¦Â¦
I It may be added further that Italy does
not look upon the papacy from this point
of view,', as the . Government, j as -well | as
the Italian people,: evince their desire . to
demonstrate to j the \ world that under the
present conditionsâ that' is, since; 1S70;
.when the temporal power fellâ the Pope
and the Vatican have enjoyed complete
liberty In the" exeVclse of " their spiritual
offices.
"My duty is to assure, not only, in the
interest of Italy, but of all Europe, the
most absolute 'liberty to the approaching
conclave, and the fullest assurance may
be entertained that this 'liberty .'will'; be
given." y ".. " * , . t
Pope Leo has manifested great interest
in the intended visit of King Victor. Em
manuel to Paris next week. To-day he
made inquiries regarding the plans for
the trip, but the person Interrogated was
unable to reply.
The Tribuna, the seml-ofllclal organ of
the Government, says to-night:
kept constantly advised of every
stage of the sickness. Immediately after
yesterday's conference Professor Rossoni
called on the Premier and made a state
ment regarding the condition of the Pope.
He again informed the Premier of^ this
morning's conference. Regarding ques
tions put to him Slgnor Zanardelll has ex
pressed his personar feeling regarding the
Pontiff. He added: " . . \

After the operation the Pope felt so re
lieved that he insisted on getting up
and took several steps toward ' his arm
chair and seated himself for a ; few min
utes. He then rose, and gomg to the
book shelves where. he keeps his, favorite
authors took down "Hermences' Ars Po
etica," returned to the armchair, and be
gan reading, holding one leg over, the
other. .He seemed to feel no Hi effects
from the operation.' On the contrary ho
appeared to have derived benefit from it.
ROME. July 10.â The Pope rose at 6
o'clock this morning. He said, he thought
the air of, his room was somewhat vitiated
and .wanted it changed. An attendant,
Plo Centra, after having been authorized
to do so by Dr. Lapponi, opened the win
dows of the whole apartments, including
that of the sickroom, the Pontiff having
previously been carefully covered wltn
extra blankets. After remaining open
for a short time the windows. were closed,
with the exception of the window of the
sickroom, Dr. Lapponi having decided
that the balmy, fresh air could only do
the patient good. The" opening and the
shutting of the windows was watched
from the piazza by the people who had
gathered there to \ hear the latest news
and some of them â¢ interpreted it as
meaning that the Pontiff was dead, which
necessitated a prompt official denial.
The Pope prayed for half an. hour, and
then had breakfast, partaking of the yolk
of an egg beaten up with sugar, hot cof
fee and a light biscuit. The Pontiff then
attended to hi* toilet, but he did, not
shave. He then received his private sec
retary. Mgr. Angell. who was again sur
prised at the Pope's brightness of mind
and display of energy.
On. leaving the sickroom Mgr. Angeli
remarked to those who surrounded him
and asked for news that, If It was not
known that the Pope was dangerously
UK from his appearance at that time one
would say he was In his normal condi
tion. The monslgnor added that the Pon
tiff referred to several different matters, .
recalling exactly the most minute de
tails, and remembering facts, figures arid
dates with marvelous promptness, and all
this to the accompaniment of snuff tak
ing. The same impressions were formed
by Count Peccl, who visited the Pope
after Mgr. Angell.
The operation this morning was almost
identical to that of Thursday morning.
The Pope lay on his couch with v his skin
exposed. The affected parts were washed
with a solution of alcohol, cocaine was
hypodermlcally injected and Dr. Mazzonl
inserted a Praval needle, which by suction
drew out the vitiated matter. The opera
tion was comparatively painless and was
performed .without recourse" to chloro
form.
Operation Leaves No Sign of Distress
or Pain.

through another door past the armed
guard and into the quiet street.
During the remainder of the day but
few of the public sought the Vatican.
Then came the night bulletin, and far
larger crowds than had gathered during
the day wandered to th? Vatican In the
cool of the evening.- The Swiss guarda
had received instructions only to admit
a small portion of the Inquirers prior to
the printing of the bulletin, and even this
restricted number almost filled the court
of the Vatican. while many waited in sus
pense on the steps of, St. Peter's.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., July lO.-The

the hottest of the year.
LOUISVILLE, Ky.. July 10.â This was

There were several prostrations.
PHILADELPHIA, July W.-The hot

the past week continues to-night- The
maximum temperature to-day was 94 de

heat and a large number of prostrations
were reported.

HOT WAVE CONTINUES
THROUGHOUT THE EAST
Thursday's record of 94 degrees at 4
o'clock, the high weather mark of the
year, was reached to-day at twenty min
utes past 1 o'cloik. without signs of re
lief. But by 2 o'clock the temperature
had fallen two degrees, where it remain
ed during the next two hours. At S
o'clock to-night the temperature had
fallen to W> degrees, six degrees lower
than at the same hour Thursday.
Between 5 and 7 o'clock the tempera
ture fell seven degrees, following a thun
der storm southeast of the city. The city
had been sweltering: so long in the hot
wave, however, that it was hours before
tbe offices and tenements began to feel
the effects of the cooler breezes. In the
ftreetE the cooling process was difficult.
Men, women and children crowded the
walks to recover from the heat of the
day. Many slept on the park benches,
and, where the police would permit it,
on the grass.
Daniel Lewis, a heat-crazed negro, at
tacked with a club two girls who were
carrying a large piece of lea. A mob
quickly gathered and shouted. "Lynch
him!" Lewis was rescued by detectives
and was sent to a hospital.
There was intense heat throughout the
State to-day, many prostrations being re
ported.
NEW YORK, July 10.â Thirty-eight
deaths and eighty-three prostrations In
end around New York and Brooklyn tell
the story of to-day's heat. It was the
hottest July 10th In the history of the lo
cal Weather Bureau, the highest previous
record being 91 degrees, recorded July
jo. ism.
Eighty-Three Prostrations
Is the Record of a Few
Torrid Hours.
Appalling Fatalities in
and Around New
York.
The same grim preparation Is apparent
on all sides. Count Peccl, a nephew of
the dying Pope, wearing a straw hat and
flannels, sat In the fire engine house, op
posite the private entrance to the Vati
can, chatting with the firemen. Carriage
after carriage drove into the court.' The.
French. German and other Embassadors
descended to make inquiries. , Â¦
Prince Massino, looking almost as ven
erable as the Pope himself, head of one
of the most ancient families of Rome, and
all the Cardinals and countless Bishops
and priests came to await the bulletin.
A small crowd of men, women and
children of all descriptions besieged the
door where the news was to be given out.
From the Castle of St. Angelo came the
boom of the midday gun. and then the
Palatine Guard gave . the signal for the
anxious ''crowd to be admitted. Passing
through the corridor, each received a slip
of white paper on which the morning bul
letin was already printed. Intently read
ing the papers, the â¢ crowd'-* filed - out
"Within there," said a Papal attendant,
"the rooms are all ready for Oreglia, the
Cardinal Deacon, who will reign during
the Interregnum."
The news of yesterday morning's opera
tion sent Cardinals and Embassadors
driving hurriedly to ' the Vatican. The
somber black carriages and horses of the
former, relieved only by glimpses of the
scarlet robes worn by the pale-faced oc
cupants, contrasted strangely with the
brilliant equipages of the Embassadors.
Outside St. Peter's the ordinary visi
tors hurried past the Swiss guards and
ascended the staircase leading to the in
ner court of the" Vatican. The sun beat
fiercely on the plain white shutters which
shelter the Pope's room and all eyes were
turned toward them. Compared with the
magnificence below, with. the bewildering
colors of the papal court and the rich at
tire of the guards the shuttered windows
are peasant-like in their simplicity.
Another window caught the eye. This
was open and the sun streamed In on
Raphael's priceless frescoes and lit up
the great marble portico.
The body of Mgr. Volponi seems to
have been permitted to remain almost In
the condition in which he died. Only two
lighted candles were provided, and they
were permitted to burn to the sockets
and had almost been extinguished when
a noble Roman lady came this morning
to view the body. She raised an Indig
nant outcry at such a condition of af
fairs. Hasty arrangements were then
made for the Interment. At 5 o'clock
the coflJn was brought down and placed
in a communal hearse of the fourth
class and taken to the cemetery.
A general feeling of tranquillity marked
the day in Rome yesterday, due to the
widespread belief that though the Pope's
days axe numbered, his hour has not yet
come. The sublime self-confidence of the
patient peremates the people, especially
the simpler folk, who go about their day's
work, postponing signs of sorrow and
mourning until from the sick bed itself
they hear that the unsual struggle is
nearing its end.
, The extraordinary confusion- prevailing
at the Vatfcin outside the immediate vi
cinity of the Pope's sick room is demon
strated by the remarkable neglect to
make even the most ordinary preparations
for the interment of Mgr. Volponi, the
secretary of the consistory and canon of
St. Peter's, who died suddenly yesterday
of syncope. Usually the .''funeral of so
high an ecclesiastic would have been a
prominent event in Rome, but to-day it
was completely forgotten in the shadow
cf the greater impending loss to the
church.
Shortly before midnight the condition
of the Pontiff was reported to have un
dergone no change, and it was added that
he had just dropped peacefully into
sleep. At that hour all within the palace
was quiet, the Pontiff's apartment alone
showing siffns of life. The Pope slept
until near 2 o'clock this morning, when
he awoke, seemingly more refreshed, and
asked for food. His pulse was taken and
was found to vary from 87 to V3. His
temperature was 96 degrees and his
breathing irregular.
The latter part of the night was not so
good owing to the restlessness and un
easiness of the patient. Dr. Lapponi has
been going almost every fifteen minutes
to look at the Pontiff, who did not notice
the presence of the doctor, being In a
drowsy state. Dr. Lapponi administered
a dose of chloral and gave the. patient at
the same time an Injection of camphor
caffeine.
At the examination last evening the
doctors could not perceive any re-gather
ing of serum In the plcural cavity, but
it was feared that the presence of serum
would be detected^ to-day, thus rendering
necessary, perhaps, another operation in
a few days.
Xews just received from the Vatican
says the Pose is now lying In a restless
condition after having had a good sleep
during the early hours of this morning.
As an immediate result of yesterday's
operation the Pope spent a quiet and al
most painless day, with, for his age, a
normal temperature, which only more
strikingly exhibited his strength of con
stitution and intellect.
h!s life being prolonged was In
creased, but It can hardly be said .that
the operation Improved his chances of re
covery.
â¢%OME, July 11. 4:50 a. m.â Another
jJM operation, performed yesterday,
frÂ£ has brought further relief to Pope
â¢ â¢ Leo and by it the possibility of

first peonage case to go to the jury In
this country is that of Fletcher Turner,
charged with holding Glennie Helms, a
negro. In a condition of peonage. Thia
case was given to the jury here to-night.
-The sensation of the trial was tha
charge of Judge Thomas G. Jones. It
was expected that he would be very
pointed, but none anticipated such a
charge as he gave. He reviewed the case
from beginning to end. analyzing the tes
timony of each witness, and came very
near telling the jury there must be a
conviction.
Judge Jones roundly criticized the at
torneys for the defense for trying to play
upon the feelings of Jurymen and declared
that if the negro was assessed at Good
water at nothing and sold, as was al
leged, it was a "damnable thing." Hs
emphasized his remarks by pounding upon
his desk. . '.*
It is believed there will be no verdict
reached by the jury. The Judge and Dis
trict Attorney are anxious to have a con
viction or an acquittal, so that they may
know what to do with other cases await

are that four jurors are for acquittal and

SPOKANE. Wash.. July lO.-Mlss Phil
ippina Smith, who two years ago was
separated from her newly wed husband
by her parents, swallowed strychnine yes
terday and died. Her father at the time
of the marriage was superintendent of
the Stevens County Poor Farm and tha
family resided there. Miss Smith, who
was then 17 years old, fell in love with
Bert Blair, who lived In the neighbor
hood. They eloped to Meyers, Falls and
were married, but a few minutes after
the ceremony was performed, the young
couple were overtaken and Philtppina was
separated from her young husband and
hurried tack to the parental roof. Thom
as Smith, the father, had the marriage
annulled by the Superior Court on the
grounds that his daughter was under age
and had not. the consent of her parents.
Since that day the young girl has re
mained at home and It is said has never
ceased to mourn the loss of her young
husband. It is presumed her mind was
unbalanced by disappointment.
She was a comely maiden and popular

OME, July 10.â Premier Zanar-
S B delll had a long conference to
ff*^ day with the Minister of Justice.
â¢ SIgnor Coccu-Ortu, under whose
jurisdiction are all religious af
fairs in Italy, about the eventual right
of veto "which the Italian Government
might exercise at the next conclave.
Three. Catholic powers. Spain, France
and Austria, enjoy this privilege, termed
the "right of exclusion," which entitles
them to' veto the election of a candidate
who Is not a persona grata to their Gov
ernments. In such a case a power which
may desire to prevent the election of a
certain candidate deputes a Cardinal of
Its nationality to announce the objection
at the conclave, but the announcement
must be made while the scrutiny is going
on, before the candidate has received the
majority of votes required to elect, other
wise tha protest would be Invalid.
This right has bÂ«en regarded as ex
tremely important, especially In the Mid
dle Ages, when Italy, being the largest
field of action for France, Austria and
Spain, the choice of a Pontiff was a ques
tion of supreme Importance, as he played
a large part in their disputes. Italy
claims the right referred to as the heir of
the kingdom of the two Sicilies, which en
joyed the right, but Italy did not exercise
it in the last conclave and may perhaps
find it difficult to do so now, as no Ital
ian Cardinals, even among those who are
most conciliatory, would undertake to
represent united Italy, which Is consid
ered by the church tojhave usurped the
temporal sovereignty of the papacy.- -."â¢'Â¦
Besides, Italy's policy consists in con
sidering the papacy to be meredy a spirit
ual power, which, enjoying under Italian
law complete liberty and Independence,
can without political , intervention exer
cise Its ministry in Rome, the capital of
the kingdom.
PortugaA..a]fiOuclaims^to-bÂ« entitled to
veto the election of* an undesirable Car
dinal to the papacy, but her right has
never been acknowledged. Austria tried
at both the last conclaves respectively to
prevent the election of Pius IX and Leo
XIII. but the two Cardinals deputed for
the task both arrived too late.
The last time the "right of exclusion"
was successfully employed was in 1SSS,
when Spain prevented Cardinal Giustin
ian from being elected Pope, when he had
already received twenty-one qut of the
twenty-nine votes necessary to reach the
required two-thirda vote for election.
Cardinal Giustlnian was so disappointed
that he died shortly after the conclave.
AUTHORITIES UNABLE
TO PENETRATE MYSTERY
Fail to Establish Identity of Mrs.
Lena Schneider, Who Died at
San Bernardino.
SAN BERNARDINO, July 10.â Who was
Mrs. Lena Schneider? This afternoon
and late into the night a systematic
search was made to discover some clew
that might lead to the solution of the
mystery, but nothing positive cou'.d be
found. A German resident of the town
who makes it a point to call on all new
arrivals of the German nationality stated
that he had seen Mrs. Schneider occa
sionally on the streets, and at one time
conversed with her in the park. He says
he learned from her that she had come
to this country from Alsace-Lorraine
about thirty-five years ago. that her
father was a lajge manufacturer of toys
at Strasburg, but was killed. She did not
refer to relatives in this country, and
from that It is supposed that with the
possible exception of her husband she
was quite alone. She had a habit when
alone of whispering to herself, and at
those times, it would appear as though
she was taking the part of some one. She
would , get quite worked up and gesticu
late as though earnestly trying to con
vince some one. ' â¢ t V A -
POSTMASTER GENERAL
PROPOSES TO RESIGN
Payne Wearies of Trials of His Po
sition Since the Scandal
Began.
WASHINGTON, July 10.â Personal
friends of Postmaster General Payne are
authority for the Information circulated
at the Postofflce Department to-day that
he is anxious to resign his position. HI*
friends assert that he intends to with
draw from the service " about the time
Congress assembles.
The reason assigned for Payne's desire
to resign is solely on account of ill
health. Payne was obliged recently to
take a few "days" rest In the Catskllls.
He returned to his duties last Wednes
day. It has been frequently reported that
Postmaster General Payne is wesiry of of
fice. The annoyance and trials of this
position during the last three or four
months while the postofflce scandal has
been In progress are understood to have
added to his determination to resign as
soon as he can without Inviting criticism
that would doubtless be provoked by his
resignation while the investigation U still

OLD-FASHIONED MINING.
Acting in the field at this time are sev
eral agents of the Government, who are
instructed to report particularly what
ground there is, In every case, for the
allegations of fraud that have been di
rected by the miners against the larger
timber claimants. The work of the De
partment of Agriculture and of the spe
cial agents who are looking into the min
ers' grievances in the California field is
considered to be most significant. Large
results may follow the reports of the
investigators if they^feturn the facts to
Washington exactly as they are known
to resident*' o.f California. J. N. 'High
is investigating the Plumas land district
Every land district In California will be
the scene of research before the present
year is ended.
Xow the Federal Government has sent
into California A. F. Potter, who'repre
sents the forestry division of the Depart
ment of Agriculture, with Instructions to
inquire into all the forestry conditions in
this State. The tracts of land that have
been set aside temporarily by the Govern,
ment for the enlargement of the forestry
reserve boundaries, amounting to several
millions of acres, will bo traversed by
Mr. Potter and the agents that he ap
points will assist. him. It will be report
ed to the Department of Agriculture
whether the lands in the temporarily re
served tracts are suitable for forestation.
I^ands that have been denuded and
burned over probably will be set outsido
of the reserves. If this expectation is
fulfilled it will do away with any chance
that the railroads or any other corporar
tlon or person will be able to so dispose
of comparatively worthless tracts to the
Government and securing for them bet
ter lands. Umber covered, in some other
locality or localities. Probably all lands
that cannot be advantageously forested
will be so reported on as ineligible to be
a portion of the forestry reserve system
In California.
POTTER TAKES CHARGE.
All the complaints of miners in Califor
nia concerning the taking up of mineral
lands on timber claims are about to be
investigated. Indeed, this work has been
started already without any unnecessary
noise, 'and in another fortnight special
agents of the Federal Government will
be traveling through several of the min
ing counties getting facts to report to
Washington, i-and grabbing has been go
ing on in California on a great scale. In
five years one Eastern man has succeed
ed in having 500,000 acres of land, all
classed as timber land, placed in his
name. Miners have complained that in
some of the tracts covered by these
claims there are mining properties that
have been worked for years. A great
tract in Butte and Plumas counties
amounting to 130.000 acres has been taken
up by one combination as placer claims.
This is reported to be timber land. In
the last few months the public lands
question In California has attracted a
great share of public attention.
The people in at least one county have
alleged that th<> extension of tho forest
reserves in California meant simply that
the railroads would prorit greatly by sur
rendering denuded lands on which for
ests once grew and taking in lieu for
Fuch lands fresh forests in some other
region. In Placer County there has been
so much excitement over the acts of cer
tain parties who are alleged to have
lapped timber claims over mining loca
tions that an association has been formed
and an investigation relating especially
to Piacfr County has been started. Shasta
County has been the sc*ne of much dis
cussion. The Supervisors of Plumas
County have adopted resolutions against
any extension of forest reserves in Cali
fornia. Those facts indicate the interest
that haÂ« been awakened.
Files Second Suit for Divorce.
SANTA ROSA, July 10.â Samuel C.
Hargreaves of Petaluma has brought an
other action for divorce against his wife,
Lizzto M. M. Hargreaves of San Fran
cisco. Recently Mrs. Hargreaves applied
for a divorce on the ground of extreme
cruelty, and her husband filed a cross
complaint asking that a divorce be given
him. Judge Burnett handed down an
opinion in the first case denying a divorce
to cither party, declaring that both were
at fault. Hargreavea expects to have bet
ter success with his second suit.
Will Collect Minerals for Museum.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, July 10.â
E. A. Austin of the class of 1905, in his
capacity of assistant to the curator of
the Leland Stanford Junior Museum, has
gone to the mining region about Slitter
Creek for the purpose of collecting min
erals for the museum. " Particular atten

SANTA ;ROSA. July 10.â Judge Burnett
handed down an opinion this afternoon
in which he . denied the motion to dis
miss the second amended petition of Cora
L. Wlckersftam, as executrix of the es
tate of the lata Frank P. Wickersham,
to revokÂ« the probate of the last will and
testament of I ..yd la C. Wickersham. Judge
Burnett wishes to hear the evidences of
alleged fraud and undue influence in re
gard to the contract entered into by
Frank P. Wickersham on August 29, 1S99,
and further proceedings In the matter of
revocation of the will will be stayed until
the determination of the Interest of Mrs.
Cora Wickersham and her minor son. I.
G. Wickersham Jr.. in the estate.
Prior to the death of Frank P. Wicker
sham lie entered into a contract with hi*
brother, Fred Wickersham. and his sis
ters, Mrs. May Bergevin and Miss Lizzie
Wickersham. to sell Kls interest In the
estates of his father and mother for $28,
000. The father's estate alone was val
ued at $150,000. He also bound himself
and his heirs to never contest the will
of either parent. Upon his death his wife,
Cora L. Wickersham, in behalf of her
self and her minor son. began proceed
ings to secure a portion of the property.
She alleged that the agreement to nell
his share of the estate was secured from
Frank Wickersham by means of fraud,
undue influence and false representations
on the part of the other heirs. It is also
alleged the amount given her husband
was wholly Inadequate. The charge has
been made that at the time of signing
the agreement Wickersham was in such
a condition from the use of liquor and
narcotics that he was totally unfit to
transact business.

GOVERNOR PARDEE will select
plan? to-day for the California
building to be erected by this
State at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition. Four architects have
submitted plans and the chief execu
tive of the State will select the best. The
names of the architects will not be ap
pended to the drawings and the Governor
will be unable to tell who the competitors
are. Â¦
The Governor notified E. B. Willis, sec
retary of the commission, that he would
be In Oakland to-day and Willis will take
the plans to hlm^ At the last session of
the Leglslature'th* co^imisBlon wasestaiv;
lished and was alloweaf"Â«30,000for exhibi
tion purposes. Of this^sum $20,000 was set
apart for the erection of a building at
the big exposition. Commissioner J. A.
Filcher visited St. Louis and selected a
site for the building and upon his return
invited leading architects to submit plans.
Mr. Filcher has been successful in get
ting one of the most desirable locations
In the entire grounds. It is on an emi
nence and overlooks all the concessions.
It Is almost in the center of tho im
mense tract of land set apart for the ex
position and is situated close to the Agri
cultural building, where all of Califor
nia's exhibits will be shown.
This building, as to size, will not com
pare with the State building erected at
the World's Fair in Chicago. That struc
ture cost the State more than $100,000 and
was ,used for exhibition purposes.
The plams for the' building to be erected
at St. Louis call for a building 60x80 feet,
two stories in height, and to be pat
terned after the old mission style of
architecture. The building will be used
for reception purposes only. The lower
floor will contain a large public reception
room, a -hall -for meetings and stereopti
con exhibitions, a general room for gen
tlemen visitors, a ladles' parlor, offices
for the secretary and commissioners and
a buffet. The upper floor will be used
for apartments for the commissioners and
other attaches.
The commission will no doubt select the
plans approved by the Governor. One of
the rooms in the building will bo finished
in California woods. The building will be
constructed of staff.

donia, Father de Smet Justice Belcher and
numerous others. In the passing years these
several mines, mostly owned and operated in
dividually, have been consolidated in groups
and finally absorbed by the central company
â the Homestakeâ until these mines; noted in
their day. have to a great extent lost their
identity. The principal mines and mills of the
group originaNy were the Homestake at first
nlth a mill of thirty-five light stamps, which
was removed in 187% and a mill of eighty heavy
stamp* built. This was followed by the High,
land Chief with 120 stamps and the Golden
Star with 120 stamps; the Caledonia had orig
inally twenty stamps some distance from the
mine, but later built a 60-stamp mill, at the
mine; the Golden Terra and Deadwood mines
had sixty stamps each. These mines after
ward were consolidated and the mills made
one by the removal of sixty stamps of the
Deadwood to the Terra mill. The Father de
Smet had originally ten stamps, but thla mill
was torn down and one Â»f 100 stamps built.
Many changes have since been made until now
the Homestake Company operates 90O stamps.
The Homostake mine has a record of gold
production exceeding $00,000,000. Of this sum
$30,000,000 has been profits. $18,000,000 of
which has been disbursed to stockholders Â¦ in
dividends and $12,000,000 In the purchase and

has paid over $12,000,000 in dividends in 296
successive monthly payments, covering a period
of twenty-four years, and eight months up to'
June, 1903. The Homestake Is not a wet mine

The attorneys for Rhea in a last effort
went before Judge Holmes of the District
Court in an endeavor to get the lower
court to prepare an injunction stopping
the execution. Before, the Injunction
proeedings could be prepared Governor
Mickey's order was carried out and Rhea
was hanged at 1:21 o'clock.
The crime of Willla^n Rhea was the kill
ing of Herman Zahn, a saloon-keeper, in
the village of Snyder. January 4. 1901.
With two companions. Rhea had been
carousing for a number of days. They
entered Zahn's saloon, flourishing weapons
and demanding that the inmates hold up
their hands. Zahn pleaded with the men
to leave his place. Rhea thereupon shot
him dead and kicked the body several
times as It lay upon the floor. The three
men escaped, but were captured after a
running fight, in which Rhea was slightly
wounded. Unusual pressure had been
brought on the Governor for a reprieve.
The name of Rhea was assumed. His
parents live in Indiana and his father
sent lawyers from that State to argus
with Governor Mickey. Petitions for
clemency were also circulated in Lincoln
and over the State and were numerously
signed. Rhea was but 13 years old when
the crime was committed.
The Supreme Court denied the applica
tion for an injunction, but expressed a
willingness to go into consultation re
garding the granting of a reprieve by the
Governor until a further hearing of the
application could be made. Governor
Mickey refused to grant a further re
prieve and ordered the Sheriff to proceed
with the execution.
LINCOLN. Nebr.. July 10.-iThe hangin*
of William Khea. which was to have
taken place at 12:30 o'clock, was post
poned nearly an hour, pending a decision
of the Supreme Court on an application
for an Injunction to prevent the hang-
Ing. The action before the court was
brought in view of the reprieve granted
Khea by former Governor Savage. The
reprieve imposed hard labor upon Rhea
as punishment. The attorneys for Rhea
argued that this Imposition nullified the
sentence for hanging, in that it served
two punishments for the same crime.

The Coroner's office was notified and
Deputies Fennell and Murphy hurried to
the scene. The police were also communi
cated with and Detective Harry Braig
was detailed cm the case. Pending the
arrival of the officials from the Morgue
several sacks were placed over the <ace of
the deceased to hide the distorted fea
tures from the curious gaze of the mor
bid crowd. The body of the dead man
was found lying on his back with the
feet toward the building and the head
toward the curb. The dead man's hat
was lying on the sidewalk near the body.
Inquiry in the neighborhood among the
residents of the various houses which
face on the street and the children who
were playing In the vicinity only tended
to deepen the mystery. 1 No one had seen
the man, and where he came from and
how he received the wounds which caused
his death were a mystery. On the north
east corner of Green and Gough streets
a" new' building Is in course of construc
tion, but-the score of mechanics employed
there could give no information that
would tend to throw any light on the
affair. . ...
MYSTERY DEEPENS
WHAT may prove to be one of
the most mysterious murders
that has ever engaged the at
tention of the police was dls
' covered yesterday afternoon
about 3 o'clock, when the dead body of
a man. later ascertained to be Joseph
Hausel. a German brewery worker, was
found lying on the sidewalk in a pool of
blood on the west side of Gough street,
between Vallejo and Green. A small punc
tured wound in the right side of the
throat and the skull completely fractured
left no. question as to the cause of death.
Shortly after 3 o'clock yesterday after
noon George F. Foster, a teamster resid
ing at 995 Valencia street and employed
by Arnold & Co.. while driving down
Gough street, was surprised to see the
body of a man lying prone on the pave
ment in front of 2523 Gough street. He
alighted from his wagon and "walked over ;
to the ; man. By this time a crowd of
children who had been playing in the
neighborhood, some carpenters from a
building In course of construction and
others collected at the scene.
Patrolman C. A. Landis at this Juncture
arrived and took charge. Dr. Frank P.
Topping of 1S26 Vallejo street, who had
been summoned by some youth, arrived
and upon examination pronounced the
man to be dead. Before leaving the phy
sician was attracted by what appeared
to be a scratch on the right side of the
throat. Upon closer examination he was
surprised to find that it was a punctured
wound such' as could be inflicted with a
small penknife or a stiletto. The use of
the probe demonstrated the fact that the
wound was about an inch and a half in
depth and had undoubtedly severed a
small artery.
From papers in the dead man's trunk
it is learned that he was a brewer and
formerly worked in the Bay View brew
ery, at Seattle. A- letter written to a
prominent firm of attorneys in Seattle, in
which Hausel stated that he had been in
jured In, the Bay View breweYy and of
fering the case to them upon his terms
was also found.. The letter bad undoubt-
WORKED IN SEATTLE.
Thinking no more of the matter, this
valuable witness continued on his way.
Somoi time afterward some one informed
him that a man had been shot on Gough
street. He arrived at the scene as the
Morgue wagon was driving off. At that
time he .was under the impression that
the dead man had shot himself. His in
formation will be thoroughly sifted to
day by the police.
Dr. Ba'cigalupl performed an autopsy
on the body at the Morgue last evening,
which developed the fact that the force
of the blow .which caused death was suf
ficient to shatter completely the skull and
drive the atlas into the brain. It was
found that the punctured wound in the
neck had extended to a depth of about an
inch* and severed one of the smaller ar
teries. An examination of the lungs
showed that this wound had caused quite
an internal hemorrhage. Dr. Bacigalupi
in discussing the case declared that it
was one of the moist mysterious that had
ever-come under his observation.
"I 'have never seen such a completely
shattered skull."- said he, "and it Is my
impression that the dead man must have
been dealt a most terrible blow or fallen
on his head frÂ«;m a great height to have
caused such a fracture. It would not
have been possible to nave sustained such
an Injury by falling to the sidewalk. The
wound in the neck, although not very
deep, severed one of the minor arteries,
which caused : a hemorrhage. I find that
the atlas was driven clear into the brain
by the force of the blow, and death was
instantaneous." ;
Detective Braig repaired to the wharf
of the steamer 1 Montlcello at the foot of
Mission ' street and upon opening thÂ»
trunk called for by the check found let
ters showing that the name on the pock
etbook was the correct one, and that the
dead man had arrived in this city on the
steamer Mo'ntfcello from Vallejo on the
evening of April 8.
At a late -hour last night the police
came upon a clew which tends strongly
to show- that Hausel was deliberately
murdered by two men. The name of the
police informant Is for obvious reasons
withheld. His story is to the effect that
while walking 'along Green street he ob
served a man whom he describes as Han
sel bplne followed- down that thorough
fare by two men. The pursued man was
walking fast and turned repeatedly to
sec if his pursuers were still keeping up
the pursuit. He appeared to be anxious
to escape from them and. according to
the police informant, turned up Gough
street with the two fellows at his heels.

his identity he was evasive and hung up
the receiver. The police from this were
inclined to believe that Hausel was a
non-union man working for the telephone
company and had perhaps been stabbed
and thrown off the roof of 2523 Gough
street, but the subsequent Information re
ceived precluded such a theory. Startling
developments are looted for with the ar
rest of the two men who followed Hausel
to his doom.

A few days later the proprietor had
occasion to look at the book and found
that thÂ«. page in question had been torn
O'Jt.
Among those who have written to Col
onel Best's son about his death is S. J.
Anderson, who during 1S95 and 1896 was
Chief of Police of Harrisburg.
"Will you kindly inform me," he says,
"wheth.r you know the present where
abouts of Di. and Mrs. John D. Woods
and child, from 8 to 10 years of age?
The Woods were residents of this city
in 1S9j and 1S%, and at that time I was
Chief of Police and had official business
with them."
The child Woods has with him now is
only 5 or C years old.
California detectives with warrants and
extradition papers will soon be here. A
description of Woods and his wife has
been sent out to the large cities.
It was learned from Atlantic Cjty to
day that the Woods were at the Aldlne
Hotel there in August, 1902. This hotel
changed proprietors recently. The :iew
manager it; looking over an old register
saw the name of Dr. John D. Woods and
wife. He mentioned this to Dr. Woods
and Woods said: "Oh, no, that was not
nie."
Woods had three trunks and wanted a
bj'gsagemaster at the railroad station to
check them to Pittsburg. As his tickets
were only to Philadelphia this was re
fused. The trunks were rechecked here
to Bethlehem. Pa. It is supposed that
Woods lias gone there; as Bethlehem is
only a few miles from Allentown, to
which town the doctor in a recent letter
to Colonel Best's son, stated he intended
to go soon;' '
home in San Rafael, Cal., Colonel
William J. Best died mysteriously, came
to this city on Monday from Atlantic
City.
PHILADELPHIA. July 10.â Police
officials here have received in

Woods and his wife, in whose

SAN RAFAEL, July 10.â A strong
, chain of circumstantial evidence
is Ix^r.jr forged around John Don
ald Woods and Alice Cloy Woods,
who are suspected of the murder
â¢f Colonel W. J. Best. Almost positive
roof is Sn the hands of the local au
horltlea shewing that the fugitives are
riminals of the first water. The record
â¢f Â¦Dr." Woods In the East is a most
jrifavory one. and the actions of the
V.'Fband and wife who passed themselves
>ff hÂ«--r* as brother and sister, are most
perplexing to the officials or Marin Coun
ty. Almost every hour brings to light
various little details in regard to their
life hero which shows them to be ex
ceptionally shrewd. But they have at
!sfÂ» overreached themselves.
The charge of murder which will be
jt' Tarred against Woods and his wife
Â¦ wh^n thÂ«^y arf- apprehended will be sub
stantiated by circumstantial proof, while
the charge of grand larceny upon which
they are now fugitives from Justice will
â¢ be si clearly established that a conviction
Is certain to follow. Forgery and perjury
are otfcer crimes that have been commit
ted by the fugitives.
The local authorities are working dili
gently upon the case. A most thorough
search was made to-day for Ichi Tonakai,
a Japanese, who was employed as a ser
vant in the Woods household at the time ,
of . Colonrl. Best's death. It is thought;
that the Japanese may be able to fur
nish some important evidence and every
effort will be made to locate him.
SEARCHING FOE EVIDENCE.
Mrs. J. I. Herspring. who at present oc
cupies the house at 723 Fifth avenue, in
which Colonel Best died, has fur
nished considerable proof against Woods.
Among other things Mrs. Herspring
claims that Woods' hair was dyed, and
she alleges that she has seen him touch
it up. She also states she learned much
of the couple's life through their liule
girl Kathleen. Mrs. Herspring in an in
terview to-<3ay said:
Vi*hen the Woods occupied this house I lived
juyt to the rear. My little child used to play
with little Kathleen, their child. From the
vr-ry first I wag cufplcioug cf the couple, and
from Kathleen I learned much about them.

something wrong. I <3id not believe they were

Incidentally the Lord Mayor made a
striking reference to, the Kishenev mas

United States, was not bound by diplo

hesitated to. raise its -voice "in pratest

, Admiral Cotton made a graceful ac
knowledgment of the kindly welcome that
the Americans had received from the
British fleet and people, and added:
"The squadron is here by direct order

I am sure 1 speak for the peoples of both
countries when I say I hope and I believe
that the Cross of St. George and the
Stars and Stripes will never be waved

Prolonged cheering greeted the ad
miral's speech.
In conversation with American officers
at the King's dinner at Buckingham Pal
ace yesterday evening members of the
Cabinet expressed a desire for an exten
sion of the Monroe doctrine. Recognizing
the paramount influence of the United
States in the Western Hemisphere, Great
Britain, they said, wants Washington to
exercise control in some way over the
financial obligations of the Central and
South American states. Apparently
Great Britain, not desiring a repetition of
the Venezuelan affair, favors the adop
tion of means whereby, the smaller re
publics will be compelled to meet their
obligations without pressure from Europe.
"Gentlemen," said the Lord Mayor, "in
the course of my term of office it is my
duty to entertain many people, but I wish
to tell you that this luncheon was not

American squadron go without showing
them, and I hope all the people of Amer

DOES YOTJB SCAXP ITCH?
Are Your Hairs Dropping One by
OneP
If your scalp itches you are doubtless
s-unvring from dandruff. The dandruff
perm is digging up your scalp In little
flakes, called dandruTf, and sapping the
life of the hair bulb. No hair prepara-
tion that is a mere hair stimulant and
tonic will cure dandruff because it won't
kill the germ that causes the trouble.
Nowbrc/s Horplcide is the latest scien-
tific discoverv and it will kill the dan-
druff perm. Df-stroy the cause and you
remove the effect: kill the Â«?erm and you
will have no more dandruff, falling hair
or baldr.t-ss. Sold by leading druggists.

STEPS ON A MATCH AND
IGNITES HER CLOTHING
A suit for divorce was filed Â¦ by David
W. Critchlow against Alice Oritchlow for
desertion.
Another reason given . by Mrs. Elliott
for a separation was ' the s manner in
which her husband treated their eldest
child.; She said that he once. abused the
boy In such a way that the little one be
came hysterical.' Mrs. Elliott's cup of
misery was filled to overflowing, she said,
when her husband cut off her relations
with her old friends and refused to allow
her, to visit them -or to give his consent
to their calling upon her. . i
Mrs. Elliott's story was that Elliott re
fused to allow her to accompany him to
places he visited, and last Christmas
when she asked him to take her with
him he brutally remarked in the presence
of a number of relatives and friends that
he was going to a placo not fit for her to
visit. â¢ >
Tho Elliotts were married at Berkeley
in 1S98. For a time they lived happily,
but there came a change in Elliott's de
meanor. She said yesterday that more
than a year ago he told her to go away
from him because he hated her. This was
followed by other, remarks of a like na
ture, and she* became sick and nervous.
She said she tried to act toward him as
'a dutiful and loving wife, but he no long
er lifted her and- her endeavors were
wasted.
Judge . Murasky decided yesterday that
Edward Bruce Elliott, who holds a lucra
tive position with Goldberg, Bowen & Co.,
did not- treat his wife, Lillian Elliott, in a
fit and proper manner, and awarded her
an interlocutor}' decree of divorce on. the
ground of cruelty. He also gave Mrs.
Elliott the 1 custody of' one of their two
minor "children and awarded her $50
monthly; alimony to enable her to defray
the- expense of clothing, feeding and
schooling tho child. The other child was
given to Elliott. - ' â¢Â¦':-Â¦$ "J-v--^"'

"Well, Mr. Cornelius; I suppose you
would prefer to work six hours a day if
you could," suggested Moore. -.â¢
"Yes, sir, I would," said- Cornelius, as
he stepped from the witness stand.
Frank E. Cluff , . a motorman, then pro
duced his time schedules , and explained
how it was practical to work all the car
men under, nine hours a day..
J. A. Bowlln, secretary of the carmen's
union, was the last witness of the day.
He, was once a conductor on the Califor
nia-street line, but last January he was
made the secretary of the-, union. His
salary Is 120 a week, "and his hours are
from 8 to 5. He knew of no work as nerve
racking as a car conductor's.
. The case will be" resumed on Monday
and Livernash expects to close bis case

WOULD ACCEPT . SIX.
President Cornelius of the "carmen's
union testified that after fourteen* years'
experience *as â¢ a , carman he considered
that eight hours was long enough for any
carman to work in one day. The men
had asked to have their time cut down
to'nine hours.as they did not wish to ask
too many sudden changes at one time.
He considered that the men now spend
all the leisure they have nursing their
strength to meet their work.'
"Do you think," asked Moore, "that the
nerve-racking is as much on a street car
man as on a professional man, say a law
yer or a doctor, who works fourteen hours
a day?"
"No, I won't say that," replied Corne
lius, "but then lawyers and doctors who
work fourteen hours a day generally re
tire after about twenty years'- practice."
* "Well, I don't know any lawyers who
retire after twenty years' work," replied
Moore, adding, "can you name any?" v *
"Why, there is Niles Searls, for In
stance," said Livernash.
"Oh, N lies Searls: why, he has been too
old to work for years and he is the only
case I ever heard of of an attorney who
could find time to quit practicing," said
Moore. â¢
At the afternoon session President Hol
land said he did not know previous to the
present proceedings that car cleaners and
others, such as oilers, worked without a
day off. In the future all men working
for a monthly wage would receive every
other Sunday off and they would still re
ceive full pay.
"Supposing that the nine-hour schedule
proved practical, would you accept it?"
Llvernash asked him.
"I can't say that," was the guarded an
swer. He thought the chief requirements
for a platform man In a streetcar com
pany's employ were honesty and sobriety.
At this juncture Livernash read a clip
ping from The Call giving a description
of a scene at the Palace Hotel during the
visit of the late President Harrison. In
the article in question Harrison praised
carmen and said he considered that their
responsibilities were more than that of 'a
pilot bringing In a ship from the ocean.
President Holland would not admit that
the men were as skilled as pilots.
EIGHT HOTJRS ARE ENOUGH.
MEN WILL .GE? A DAY OFF.
He said that he had no disposition to
overwork his men. He described the
world as "a hard-working world," and he
thought that no business man, lawyer or
other professional man worked Jess than
twelve hours a day. He said:
Personally I like hard work, and I also like
men with ambition and who are fond of hard
work. If I were a workman I would want to
work more than eight hour* a day. Men work-
Ing by the hour don't hurt our purses, and all
men who wish to work over nine hours a day
are gratified in their desire when we can ar
range it. The plan of the men working only
nine hours a day was shown to be impractical
by Mr. Chapman, the last witness.
In answer to the question whether he
believed the present overtime schedule
was fair he replied in the affirmative,
adding, "I think wages are extremely
high."
THIS IS A HARD WORLD.
t The carmen were allowed 5 per .cent a
year interest on their $25 deposit which
they had to put up when they enter the
service of the company. This rate -was
higher than they, could get in a savings
bank. He was -unable to get 5 per cent
for any of his investments, nor could he
think of being able to safely invest his
money and secure this rate of interest in
the future.
He had talked over expenses with his
wife, and she had remarked that the
actual cost of living here was much
cheaper than in cither London or Pitts
burg. The only thing he knew that had
gone up in price was the cost of tongue.
At the Palace grill they had raised this
article 10 'cents on the menu. He under
stood, however, that flour and vegetables
had advanced, but he fancied that vege
tables were cheaper here than in any
other market in the world. - Â¦ . â¢
President Arthur Holland of the United
Railroads was then called by Livemash.
He said he was a married man and re
sided with his wife at 2423 - Broadway.
Recently he held a conversation with Mr.
Baldwin of the firm of Baldwin &
Howell, real estate agents, and that gen
tleman then said that there had been no
material change in the last five
years in the rents of homes usu
ally occupied by carmen. The United
Railroads owned a few houses in this city
and rented them to carmen, but the rents
had not been raised since the company
acquired the property.-
RENTS ABE UNCHANGED.
If the men worked but nine hour* a day the
company would be compelled to put oo.a num
ber of extra* men. . Supposing. a carman working
nine hours a . day went to work at S in the
morning. He would be finished by 3 or 4
o'clock In the afternoon. The heavy traffic
commences late in the afternoon and conse
quently a large force of extra men who would
make only one or two trips a day would be
employed.
Some time ago I rot a petition from some of
the men asking that they be allowed to work
nine hours straight, without a rest or meals. X
refused this request in the Interests of the com
pany, for I thought that a man could not glv*
his best services to the company working nine
hours at a stretch without anything to eat.
The arbitration proceedings between the
carmen and the United Railroads yester
day were full of interesting' testimony.
Manager Chapman testified that | after
careful study of the ; situation he was
certain that It would .not be practical for

Chief Deputy Donovan of the Board of
Public Works has recommended that New
Montgomery street be accepted as a pub
lic highway and, if the claim of the Sel
fridge estate stands good in law, the city
will be obliged to purchase the disputed
portion of the street.
The property owners who petition that
New Montgomery street, from Market to
Howard street, be accepted by the city
for street purposes recite that for the last
thirty years the street named has been
paved, sewered and kept in repair for
use as a public highway. On December
22, 1869, the Montgomery Real Estate
Company deeded what is known 33 New
Montgomery streef to the city. This deed
was recorded on January 21, 1SS3, at the
request of William Sharon.
The claim of the present representatives
of the Silfrldge estate is that the por
tion of tne land on which the Gra$<l Ho
tel now stands -was leased by the " Sel
fridge estate to the Montgomery-street
Real Estate Company and that it did not
Include that portion of the street which
belonged to the estate and which is now
In contention.
Opposed to these petitioners are Mrs.
Minnie L. Selfridge and Lydia G. Sel
fridge, who filed a protest yesterday, in
which they claim that a portion of New
Montgomery street, for a distance of six
ty-eight and a half feet north of Steven
son street, is their private property and
has belonged to them for the last thirty
years.
According to documents filed yesterday
before the Board of Public Works, a por
tion of New Montgomery street does not
belong to the city, but to private parties.
A petition has been filed by a number
of property owners of New Montgomery
street, asking that the street be dedicat
ed for street purposes and accepted for
that purpose.
This petition is signed by the Sharon
Estate Company, Hubert E. Law, Hart

wards, Thomas Crellin and the Pacific

pany.
- The State Board of Prison Directors
will meet at San Quentin to-day and for
mally elect a successor to Warden Martin
Aguirre. The outcome of the meeting is
awaited in political circles with the keen
est interest, for not the slightest intima
tion has been J given by the directors as
to who their choice will be for the im
portant position. Â¦
Rumors have been circulated persistent
ly to the effect that the members of ttie
board had agreed to defer action in this
matter until Director Devlin returned
from the. East, but these stories are with
out foundation. It was announced last
evening from an authoritative source that
nothing will further deter the members
of the board, from making a change In
the management of the affairs of the pri
son to-day.
The directors, fully appreciating the
demoralizing influences prevailing at San
Quentinâ results of the unsettled condi
tions thereâ have deemed it their duty to
abandon all partisanship that may exist
among them relative to candidates for
warden and unite" upon some man on
whom they can count for a clean admin
istration. That further delay in the war
denship matter is dangerous to the in
stitution the directors readily realize and
they will at once bring about a much
needed change and see that the rules of
the prison are enforced without fear or
favor.
The directors insist that they have not
united on any particular candidate. With
out political prejudice when they meet
to-day they will consider the qualifica
tions of all candidates, especially as to
competency in the disciplining of crimin
als and managing an institution of the
character of San Quentin prison. They
will then decide who is the most capable
of those nominated.

STREETCAR MEN SWEAR
THEY ARE NOT ROBBERS
Judge Is Puzzled Over Case of Philip
Philipps and George P.
McCarrolL
The preliminary examination of Philip
Ihilipps. conductor, and George P. Me
t arroll, pripman, both of the Geary street
line, on a charge of robbery was held be
fore Police Judge Conlan yesterday. On
a motion to dismiss the Judge reserved

\V. K. Trimpler. the complaining wit
ness, repeated on the witness stand the
story told the police when he asked for
.->. warrant and swore that Philipps took
Ji out of his pocket at Point Lobos ave
nue and Wood street early Wednesday
morning while McCarroll held him.
Both defendants again denied commit
ting the robbery, and said they were
holding on to the rear of Trimpler's
wagon, when Trimpler jumped off and
accused them of throv/inp stones, which
they denied. Trimpler thereupon threat
en- d to "lick" them and struck at Philipps.
ivho retaliated. Trimpler got "cold feet"
and ran away. When asked what object
Trimpler could have In saying he was
robbed, they replied that he must be
crazy.
husband of the plundered woman, on the
afternoon of the robbery underwent a
scrutiny by the police and for a time it
was thought he might know more about
the crime than he was willing to admit.
He is a bricklayer and quit work on Tues
day afternoon. He arrived at the house
soon after the robbery and explained his
presence there by saying that he had a
premonition that something would hap
pen to his wife.' This arfected him so
strongly that he determined to return
home.
DISTRUST HUSBAND.
This story, taken in connection with the
fact that the robbery was committed by
person? possessing pass keys to the flat
and that their manner of seeking., the
money evidenced a perfect knowledge of
where Mrs. Hughes usually carried her
valuables, rendered the police skeptical
regarding Hughes' "premonition."
The husband did not know that Mrs.
Hughes had banked the money the morn
ing after its receipt. As soon as he had
left for work she went downtown and de
posited it without telling him of her in
tention. According to the neighbors the
couple frequently quarrel over money
matters. Although Mrs. Hughes says that
only she, her husband and little girl knew
that she had received the money, those
who live in the neighborhood aver that
the fact was generally known to most of
them. The little girl spoke of it many
times during the day to her playmates,
who repeated it to their parents with all
the picturesque exaggerations of child
hood, until the sum had grown to be a
fortune.
Last night the police pretended to be
lieve that Hughes was in no way impli
cated in the crime and stated that he
would not be arrested unless some new
developments occur to change the present
aspect of the case.
READY TO NAME
PRISON WARDEN
FORMER CONVICT ARRESTED
FOR BRUTAL ROBBERY OF
MRS. V HUGI1ES.
FORMER CONVICT PLEADS
GUILTY TO BURGLARY
Henry Bays Was Tried and Acquit
ted Years Ago for a Sensa
tional Murder.
Henry Bays, alias "Lucky" Bays, alias
George Johnson, pleaded guilty in Judge
Lawlcr's court yesterday to a charge of
burglary. He will be sentenced to-day.
On April 13 he entered the vacant house
at 211$ Pacific avenue belonging to Charles
K. Hsirley. Entrance was gained by
opening a window, and Bays stole a num
ber of glass globes, which he carried
away in a sack. , ,
A quarter of a. century ago Bays . was
the principal figure in one of the most
sensational trials ever held in the crim
inal courts here. He was tried for strang
ling a Mrs. Dre-11, an old German woman,
who kept a lodging-house at California
and Dupont streets. She was found dead
with a towel tied tightly around her
neck. Bays was one of her roomers and
he was suspected of having stolen money
from her on several occasions. He was
arrested for the murder, tried and ac
quitted, as the evidence was purely cir
cumstantial. After that he was called
"Lucky" Bays*.
There are two prior convictions against
him for burglary in the first degree. On
September 23, 18S2, he was sentenced to
serve one year in Folsom penitentiary,
and on April 21, 1SS5, he y/as sent to the
same institution for fifteen years.
AS a result of police investigation
of the brutal robbery of Mrs.
Thomas Hughes Thursday after
noon at her residence, 314 Gough
street, John Zimmerman was
taken into custody -yesterday by. Detec
tives Wren and Reynolds. He will be
held at the City Prison until further in
quiry into his movements on the day of
the robbery.
Suspicion was directed to Zimmerman
by the fact that on Tuesday last Detec
tive Wren saw him loitering on the cor
ner of Haves and Gough streets, near
Mrs. Hughes' home. After his arrest he
was questioned regarding his presence in
that vicinity and he said he had been
sent there by a hotel steward with a mes
sage to a girl. He gave the steward's
name but could not remember the girl's
name nor address. The steward denied
knowing Zimmerman and paid he had not
intrusted a message to any one that day.
Zimmerman is a former convict and
has a criminal record in this city. He
was arrested in March, 1S97, for stealing
$240 from John Young, a baker on Mc-
Allister street, for whom he worked. In
the Superior Court he was allowed to
plead guilty to petty larceny and was
I sentenced to six months in the County
Jail. On June 15 he was arrested for en
tering the" grocery store of William
Stenke, at Oak and Devlsadero streets,
and on August 26 of the same year was
sentenced to serve five years in Polsom
penitentiary. He was discharged March
2\, 1902.
BLAMED FOB OTHER CHIMES.
In addition to the Hughes robbery the
police believe they can fasten other
crimes upon Zimmerman. They think he
may be one of the two men responsible
for the robbery at the house of William
L. B. Mills at 2078 Broadway on the
I morning of July 2 and also the burglar
who entered the grocery store of Phillip
Bayen at Point Lobos and Eighth ave
nues and stole a large amount of money,
a check and some telephone slugs. A
pocket full of slugs was found in Zim
merman's possession at tne time of hi3
arrest. In his room at 123 Turk street
was a large caliber revolver, many keys
and a bundle of files.
Mrs. Hughes had almost entirely re
covered yesterday from the shock oc
casioned by her rough treatment at the
hands of the man v.ho held her while the
other searched the house for the JjO) they
thought secreted there. The story of her
ill usage was much exaggerated in the
first accounts. The man who held her
did not strike her, but in attempting to
stifle her cries he caused her nose to~"
bleed, which, apart from the shock, was
the most serious Injury she received. She
persists in her statement that three men
took part in the robbery, but the police
believe that only two were engaged in
it. for two men were seen leaving the
house.

WAMTS PORTION
OF THOROUGHFARE
The mutterings of a coming storm have
become audible from the direction of a
bevy of â¢well-known society folks com
prising the Semnervireris Club.
To the Governor of the State, as ex
pQcio member of the Park Commission
ers for the Big Easin Reservation, the
society â¢women have carried their com
plaint, which is a protest against the al
leged unfair discrimination by the Com
missioners, w'ho are said to allow favor
ites to camp in the new park, despite
the rulings to the contrary by the com
mission itself.
A rfior.th ago several San Jose people â
members of the Santa Clara branch of
the Sempervirens Clubâ petitioned the
Â«"cmmiFsior.crs fcr permission to camp in
the Big BaFin Reservation. It was re
fv.ned on the grounds that, with J. H.
Pi'kingicn. the sole guradian of the basin,
unaided in case of fires, no campers could
be allowed until the commission had made
a tour of infection and designated suit
able spots for camping places. The word
of the Commissioners was accepted with
some prumblir.g. since the Sempervirer.s
Olub had met every year at a camp of
th^ir own selection in the giant redwoods.
R.ecently it was discovered that a party
rt boys from St. Matthews' School at
San Matco were camping unmolested in
the former haunts of the club of nature
lovers and enjoying the very conveniences
that the club itself had installed therein,
and from which It had been Interdicted.
The boys said they were there by permis
sion of Professor Dudley of Stanford Uni
versity, one of the Commissioners.
Since it was through the vigorous and !
long fought campaign of the Semper- i
virens Club that the giant redwoods of !
the basin were spared from the woodmen :
and made eacred by the legislative en- i
BCtnwnt of UQL, much indignation has Â¦
b^n roused against the discrimination of ',
Commissioner Dudley.
A protest, drawn up by one of the club
members who is an attorney. Is now in Â¦
the hands of Mrs. Loveil White, press
dent of the club, and by her it will be j
transmitted to Governor Pardeee.
In the temporary absence of lies. White.
Mi^s Mary G. Gorham. the general secre- '
tary of the club, voiced the sentiments of '
h*r 't'.Iow club members when seen at ;
her hom? , TM Bush street, last night. She I
raid:
â¢'We were all disappointed when the i
commission refused us the privilege to go 'Â¦
to our old camp in the redwoods this ;
summer. We have a permanent camping |
spot there, fitted with conveniences at
our expense.
"When we heard that other people were '
rr.joying the right denied us. ar.d even i
using our camp, we were naturally sur- .
prised at the action of the Commissioners. '
Mrs. White has power to act and she '
can move without the formal sanction of ;
a club meeting. A meeting would be im- j
possible during vacation."
The snapping of a guy rope caused a
giant derrick at Third and Mission streets
to topple over yesterday afternoon. The
engineer of the machine, J. H. Smith,
was severely though not seriously in
jured, and it was only by a miracle that
the lives of a score of other workmen
were spared. In falling tne immense
boom struck a temporary sidewalk and
demolished it. Fortunately no one hap
pened to be massing au that particular
spot when the crash came, although thou
sands of people were on the thorough
fare. The mast of the derrick struck the
side of a building and ripped it to splin
ters. Again good fortune prevailed and
no one was injured.
The derrick was being used in the con
struction of a building on the northwest
corner of Mission and Third streets. It
was situated in the center of the lot upon
Â¦which improvements have just commenced
and heavy steel girders, fresh from the
factory, were being lifted about and
placed in position. One of the girders,
weighing about eleven tons, had been
raised p.r.d was in suspension, when a
guy rone cave way and the tall mast
and bocm topu'ed over sideways. The
donkey engine, which rested on the der
rick platform, pitched over also and Engi
neer Smith was thrown into an excava
tion and rendered unconscious.
On the Th'ni-strcet 3ide, where the
boom struck, is an elevated wooden side
walk. This is usually crowded with hu
manity, and especially at the hour of
the accident. Th<? mast struck the side
cf the Continental Tailoring Company's
buildlnc on Third street and snapped in
two pieces. The side cf the structure was
hacily damaged and goods in a show case
scattered la all directions.
S. 1 .2 ClvAr and C. Lair.bert are the
contractors in charge of the work. They
have been particularly unfortunate re
cently, and yesterday's accident v.'lll de
lay them a couple of days further. A
carload of steel, which has been badly
needed for some time, was lost some
where en ror.tfl from the East and only
arrived Thursday. The iron bases were
under water in St. Louis lor two weeks
and were also shipped late.

IS HEARST crazy with self-esteem? The con
stant praise of himself in his own papers is stock
for constant laughter to the general public, and
no doubt of grief to his judicious friends if he have
any. Taking him at his own estimate he is the uni
versal regulator of things. The readers of his papers,
if they believe all they get in them, must be the vic

blindness. Readers of Mr. Hearst's papers are in
formed that the whole country is waiting on the tip
toe of expectancy to make him President. Wher

all others as the favorite son of the republic, the
prophet, seer and revelator of all things, the suc

date and the next President.

as "the great champion of Democracy .to-day, of
great influence, an inspiring personality and of heroic
labors." Whereupon Mr. Hearst says, "There was

Only a few of our troops remain as guardians of
the peace and directors of the early life of republican

Worldly wisdom pointing the way to independ
encee is something men acquire with difficulty. One
need not look only in the ranks of the street-car men
for the lack of it. Everybody remembers General
Coxey and his industrial army that got in Washing
ton jail for not keeping "off the grass." He was a
man of property and after his army dissolved went
into business as an ironmaster and in other lines.
His profits soon rose to nearly $100,000 a year. But
now be is in the hands of a receiver. He may soon
apply for employment on a street car. He was not
content with his large profits but put them into spec
ulative enterprises, and now is ready to accuse some
body else, or society, or "conditions" for his losses.
But we may not go so far afield as General Coxey
for an example of the need of worldly wisdom. All
California was startled and disquieted by the failure
of Porter Bros. It was revealed that they had not
been content to be diligent in their business, but
had gone outside of it, to speculate in other lines
of trade, and so they went like General Coxey and
cannot stand before kings.
It is probable that if thrift and diligence were made
the rule of life by men who must work out their own
independence and abstention from outside specula
tion were their rule after their period of indepen
dence began, there would be less complaints of in
sufficiency of wages and fewer established businesses
in the hands of receivers.
One thing is sure, the man wl.o deliberately adopts
labor as a profession, never trying and never expect
ing to getbeyend the condition of a wage worker,
is a man destined to dependence all his days and to
stand before mean men
THE old and solemn book in which is the wis
dom of man and the philosophy of life for all
races and for all time says: "Seest thou a man
diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings;
he shall not stand before mean men."
As a rule diligence means success, and success in
dependence. In reading the testimony given by the
street-car men in this city one is struck by the num
ber of them who have followed a variety of occupa
tions. They have been farmers, mechanics, photog
raphers, lawyers, doctors and preachers. Some were
sailors, soldiers, stock raisers and speculators. Every
calling is represented in the list, and all of them say
that out of their other occupations they had saved
nothing and had nothing ahead when they entered
the service of the corporation for which they now
work. They all answer, when questioned on that
point, that their present wages make a better steady
income than they ever enjoyed before, and the super
intendent of the street railroads says that they have
a long and lengthening waiting list of applicants for
places in the same employment, which those who
now hold it say yields a wage insufficient for their
support.
One feature is very interesting. A majority of the
witnesses are single men, and "these testify that on
their wage of $2 50 to $2 75 per day they can save
no money. So, also, the married men with no child
ren complain that there is no margin for saving any
thing, and those with two children tell the same story
as the man with eight, though he bravely declared
that he was able to make ends meet by his wife doing
the mending and his cobbling the shoes. Now if a
man with eight children and a wife can make ends
meet the single man would seem to be able on the
same wage to save something against the getting of
a wife and the arrival of children. Perhaps if more
of the single men foresaw the time when ten people
would be supported and ends met on the wage they
get with only themselves to care for, they would be
diligent in their business and put by something on
interest or in prudent investment If this were done
persistently and thriftily it may be that the railroad
company would not have as large a waiting list com
poseaof those who cannot do as well in any other
employment.

PERSONAL MENTION.
A CONSIDERABLE number of Southern
sociologists have been discussing with more
or less pessimism the migration of white men
from the South to the Northern and the Western
States. The migration is large enough to constitute
Â«i serious drain upon the country -and the effect is
the more hurtful because those who migrate are in
many instances members of the most progressive and
enterprising element of the population. Those who
take a gloomy view of this white migration believe
that it will leave the South at last in the hands of
a white race too weak numerically and industrially
to bear the burden of the black race with patience
and success.
Of the serious extent of the migration there can
be no doubt. The census of 1900 shows that in that
year upward of 1,500,000 white "persons of Southern
birth were living in the Northern and Western States,
while only 750,000 persons from the North and West
were living in the South. Moreover the South had
only 350,000 persons of foreign nativity within her
confines at that time. Thus the South had lost a
balance of about 400,000 of her white people by the
migration. Of course a sparsely settled country like
the Southern States cannot lose so large a percent
age of its more intelligent population without suf
fering, and Southern thinkers are wondering how
the migration can be checked and what will happen
if it continue in the future as in the past.
The evil is probably not so bad as thÂ« Southerners
deem it. The South has no large cities, and, as a
consequence, men who prefer a metropolitan life
must of necessity leave those States. Secondly, she
has had in times past hardly more than a single in
dustry, and men not content to be planters or pro
fessional men have had to go North or West in.
search of a field suitable to their talents or their
tastes. Those conditions are rapidly changing.
.There is indeed no city in the South so located from
a commercial point of view as to justify any expec
tation that it will ever be a metropolis like the larger
cities of the North and West, but the development
of manufacturing industries gives assurance that
there will be in the South many considerable indus
trial centers capable of not only holding their own
youth, but of attracting immigrants from other
States. The percentage of migration is therefore
likely to be much smaller in the immediate future
than in the past; and it is not improbable that at a
future not very remote, the balance of migration may
turn the other way and show in the South a number
of white immigrants in excess of, the number of
white Southerners who, have gone elsewhere.
The extent of the recent industrialprogress of the
South was recently summed up by the statement:
"Between 1880 and 1900 the value of Southern farm
property increased by 72- per cent, against 62 per
cent for the whole Union; of farm products nearly
100 per cent, though the increase in population was
only 44. per cent. Its capital invested in manufac
turing increased 348 per cent, against a gain for the
whole Union of 252 per cent, and the value of the
manufactured products 219 per cent, against only
142 for the whole Union. From a production of
397,000 tons of pig iron in 1880 the South had in
creased to more than 3,000,000 tons in 1902; from
6,000,000 tons of coal in 1880 to 60,000,000 in 1902."
With progress like that going on the young South
erner will soon find work and wages enough at home
to render him content and he will not have to wan
der off in search of employment or of a career. There
is in fact no justification for the gloomy views which
some persons are taking of the white migration from
the South. We are a migratory people. Young
men are leaving Massachusetts and New York as well
as Georgia and Virginia. In the fullness of time,
when the population becomes settled, there will be
no section of the Union that will not have within
its confines a population sufficiently numerous and
sufficiently strong to develop its resources and as
sure its civilization.

. Our irrepressible and pugnacious friends the Ven
ezuelans have added another item of stupidity to
their record by seizing several American trading
boats. Some of these days they may have occasion
to look at the map of South America and find that
they are not on it.
Of course the affair was not perfect, for nothing
of the kind can be perfected on the first attempt.
A correspondent of the Republican in reviewing it
says: "Experience must be the teacher here as in
all ithings. We shall leave plenty of room in which
the small boy can have that joy on which he so much
counts, but for the hulking rowdy, who has hitherto
seized upon this day to invade the rights of society,
there will be a sharper and more thorough policy of
suppression. To him we owe the devilment which
has so wantonly distorted the day and made it so
far a national reproach instead of a blessing. Those
who love good order and peace and a rational cele
bration are in overwhelming majority against the
lawless element. The right of the majority has been
asserted this year beyond other years in Springfield,
and next year we shall do even better along the line
of civilization and good sense. Much remains to
be done. Why, in fact, should bedlam be let loose
on the streets of a city during so many hours of the
Fourth?" Â£
Springfield will have s better celebration next year
than this year because her people have started on the
road to reform. Experience will teach them how
to improve. Other cities however will be no better
off than before, because they have, not even started
to improve. It would be well therefore if we could
have a general following of the Springfield example.
When once begun progress will be steadily main
tained and by and by we, shall have a Fourth of
July to delight in and to be proud of, and the news
papers of the following day will be full of reports
of music, oratory, recreations and healthful games
instead of accidents, disasters, fires, injuries and
deaths.
t- v EVISED figures of Fourth of July casualties
|-r have been compiled by the Chicago Tribune
A \ for 197 cities and towns. They show that in
the celebration of the day in those localities 52 per
sons were killed and 3665 seriously injured. The
fire loss amounted to $400,625.
The list does not cover the whole country, but it
is sufficiently large to direct public attention to the
folly of continuing a form of celebration which, how
ever appropriate to the early days of the republic,
is no longer suitable to our time. With crowded
populations in large cities it is no longer possible
to indulge in a general license of fireworks and tjjy
pistol shooting with impunity. Stringent police
regulations have been enacted in almost every city
and town and yet it is impossible to have them thor
oughly enforced. Even where no regulation is vio
lated accidents happen and disasters follow. Bad as
is the list of this year it is by no means so bad as
many that have preceded it, oÂ«- as some that are like
ly to follow unless a change be made in the method
of celebration.
A critic of the day has referred to the customary
form of celebrating the Fourth as "a brutal debauch
of noise and stench and fire and death." That of
course is an unfair statement, but nevertheless it
describes accurately enough a phase of the celebra
tion which cannot fail to strike every observer. It
is all well enough to speak of the licensed uproar
of snapping crackers and blazing rockets as an evi
dence of patriotic fervor and a riot of genuine Amer
icanism; the fact remains that to most people it is
meiely a day of noise and danger. So disagreeable
is it that thousands of people leave the cities for
the sake of getting rid of the celebration as if it were
a nuisance. Surely there is neither patriotism nor
reason in perpetuating a custom that has become so
obnoxious to so large a percentage of the people.
A reformation in the form of celebrating the great
day is perhaps not so impossible as appears at first
thought. It is true we cannot abolish the existing
method of observing the day unless we supply some
thing better to take its place, but American enter
prise and ingenuity will not find that an impossible
task. The growing esthetic sense of the people ren
ders it quite feasible to substitute some form of
pageant and parade accompanied by sports and
games that would be more agreeable to the general
mass of the people than the present custom of pop
ping fire crackers and. so far from driving city people
out of town, would have the effect of bringing out
siders to the cfty to share in the general holiday.
The feasibility of the plan appears to have been
demonstrated by what was accomplished on the re
cent Fourth of July in Springfield, Massachusetts.
In that city there has been organized a permanent
"Independence Day Association," and it has arranged
a celebration which is reported to have been the most
thoroughly enjoyable that city has ever known. The
day began with parades, some stately and some fan
tastic, that led the people out of town to the' parks,
where music, orations and games were provided to
hold them not only through the day but through the
evening. Nearly the whole body of the people ap
pears to have taken part in the public celebration,
and the general verdict was one of approval and com
mendation of the work and the programme of the
association.
THE GLORIOUS FOURTH
tions Hearst, nor does his name appear in their de
tailed reports o^ the convention. The Associated
Press report of the convention makes no mention of
his name having been heard. Assuming that the
Democratic press of Iowa would not fail to note the
"greatest demonstration of the day" at mention of
Mr. Hearst's, "inspiring personality," we are led to
the conclusion that he was not mentioned at all and
that his report of his high 'qualities in his own paper
is a hypodermic revery.

son of the Confederate general of that
name and was for a time colonel of the

Among the soldier passengers were two
military bands, that of the Fifth Cavalry
and the band of the Sixth Artillery. Fine
weather was encountered throughout the
voyage and full advantage was taken of
the availability of good music. From 9
to 10 every morning one or other of the
bands and sometimes both gave a con

evening from 7:30 until 9:30 and on later
occasions there was dance music for all
who cared to make use of it.

KILLS PARTNERS
IN COLD BLOOD
Arthur McCartney, a sporting man. fol
h Â»tr of the ccg races, was found dead
icstcrday morr.inj; In his room at 2434
-Minna street with u bullet wound in his
head about three inches above the left
ear. The bull<rt !:ad taken a downward
course, passing closely behind the eyes,
to the right. A revolver With one cham
ber dischargfo was near his left hand.
Owing to tiie unusal position of the
wound the case was placed in the hands
of Detective Cody. It was learned that
McCartney had lived in that house for
five years and that for the last eleven
jears he had supported himself by betting
en coursing matches. His intimate friend.
T. Burns, who lives in the same house,
informed the Coroner that about a week
ago McCartney became morose and began
drinking heavily, desiring, as he told
liurnF. to drink himself to death.
Deputy Coroner Fennell found* In the
clothing of Â«he dead man $23 in coin, some
jewelry and a certificate of deposit for
$3OJ from a bank in Portland, Or. This
fact is regarded as evidence that the de
ppondency of the decedent was not caused
by financial distress. McCartney lost $300
:n Joe Harvey's poolrooms in Sausalito
two weeks ago. but he took the loss light
ly, according to Burns' statement, be
cause he was then $3j00 "ahead of the
game."
Burns said he was not aware that Me
.Cartnev was left-handed. This is the pe
culiar feature of the case. Should it be
learned that McCartney was right-handed
the presumption of murder would be
strong, but Burns says McCartney at
tempted to shoot himself about a week
before and that he then threatened to kill
himself eventually.
McCartney was about 40 years of age,
ur.rcan-ied and has relatives in Ohio.
If Fact Is Proved That Hs
Was Right- Handed He

Burglary is a serious offense in any

In Central America and when the bur

it becomes a capital crime, and only cold

This is the substance of the story brought
yesterday from Acapulco by the officers
of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company's
liner Colon.
The company's agency*at Acapulco on
the night of June 28 was burglarized. The
thief, after beating the watchman into
insensibility, broke open the safe and
stole the contents, about $400. Upbn re
covering consciousness Â¦ the ..watchman
gave the alarm and soldiers were sent out
In search of the burglar. After hunting
all night he was captured about twenty
miles east of Acapulco, on the road to
the City of Mexico. A careful search of
his person revealed only $S9 in his pos
session. He v<as taken back to Acapulco,
however, and there admitted his guilt.
He was sentenced to be shot.

: Ex-Chnmplon George Whitney, who
was dangerously 111 with heart trouble
and nervous prostration, is traveling In
Europe for his health. Mr. Whitney is
regaining his strength rapidly and will
possibly, be able to play again in a cou
ple, of vears. He will never figure in
tournament play again, however.
In, the tournament held at San Rafael
last week R.N. Whitney surprised both
players and onlookers , by- the strong
game he put up. He was in rare form
and it was a. pity he could nqt have met
Smith in the finals. The last named was

An interesting mixed doubles, tourna

San Rf.afel. The event is In honor of
Miss Sarah Coffin, the Newport champion,
who Is on a visit to the coast. Ten of
tho leadinir lady players have invited ten
of the gentlemen players to, participate
with them in the tournament. Two hand
some'silver loving cups will [uZ competed
for. :
The nearest teams to them are Routh
and.Dunlap and the Hotchklss brothers,
who will play from scratch. 'Handicapped
as they are, Allen and Smith probably
will not make much headway. Griffin and
Janes, the clever "pony" team, with a
handicap of "one-half of 13," appear to
have an excellent chance of winning.
George Baker/ the University of Califor
nia expert, and Ri N. Whitney entered
the tournament with rather weak part
ners and consequently received good
handicaps.
The Hotchkiss brothers lead In the race
for the trophies, having two wins to their
credit. The cuds have been 'won onco
by Clinch and McKay, Routh and Dun
lap and Allen and Smith. Clinch and
McKay no longer play together and are
out of the race.. The Tlotehklss broth

to eive much heavier odds, and conse

Twenty-one teams entered, and as the
new handlcapper is rather liberal the
matches will be closer than usual. i
When the new courts ' are completed
there will be five asphalt courts, and in
a short time it is expected the remaining
five will also be converted in asphalt.
The park can then boast of the greatest
collection of tennis courts west of Chi
cago. The success of tennis In the park
is undoubtedly due to the efforts of Reu
ben H. Lloyd, who first conceived the
idea of building public courts..
A delegation of park tennis players
waited upon the Park Commissioners yes
terday and urged the laying out of two
new asphalt courts. The Commissioners
favored the plan and work will be com
menced Immediately upon the new courts.
The site is the raised ground directly In
front of the . clubhouse. It is an ideal
spot for exhibition courts. Seats will be
erected on the sides, and it will be possi
ble to hold gome of the large tournamenls

they will put in a healthy bid for the

The Texans. who have had a desire to
bring the big meet to their State, are
feeling "anxious now that they have a
worthy rival for the prize, for they know
that the miners, with their long bank

the classic event decided In their town.
The Mlsslsippl Valley Futurity for 1303
gives promise of having the largest en
try of any stake ever run on a coursing
field. Already 225 first payments have
been made, and it is most likely that
California's record of 12S dogs will be
broken. .
Four stakes were run off In Butte on
Saturday and Sunday last, a class, spe
cial, reserve and puppy events. Among
the entries were many highly bred hounds
that have been purchased to add strength
to the already well filled kennels, includ
ing some importations from England and
such fliers as Cloudburst. Confidence and
Charming Thought, who have made rec
ords and annexed stakes on local fields.
Northern Pacific is another acquisition
to the Butte kennels. This young hound
was bred by II. C. Lowe of Kansas and is
the one that took the measure of Sacra
mento Boy In the St. Louis Waterloo of
last year. Local men figure Northern
Pacific a good one from the fact that he
not only led Sacramento Boy. but actually
outworked that wonder at his own game.
A month previous to this victory North
ern Pacific won the 1902 Mississippi Val
ley-Futurity, itself a big event.
The park now is under the right aus
pices and Is In the hands of moneyed
men, who are interested and behind the
sport for the good of the game. With
Buch leashmen as Tonkin, Blake and Mc-
Dougal adding 'their Influence It was a
simple matter to bring, coursing to Its
present high standard in Montana. The
principal business men of Butte respond,
ed liberally in the purchase of stock In
the new organization and are united in
the effort to make their city known as a
coursing center.
Coursing is enjoying a great boom
throughout the country. Butte has taken
a decided lead in the advancement of the
sport, and encouraged by the success of
its meetings last season has reached out
for further honors.
Aeolus, whose reputation as a courser
is familiar to followers throughout the
State, took first money In a thirty-two
dog event last week at Los Angeles.
Aeolus was formerly the property of
George MncK. Malcolm, but was recently
sold to E. Wright. This Is his first stake
since he has run in the name of his pres
ent owner.
When the Union Coursing Park was
closed temporarily, Charley Griswold, who
was in charge of the big field, found him
self with ah extra allowance of San Joa
quin jacks on his hands and was for a
time puzzled to know what to do with
them to keep them in condition for the
reopening of the park. To let them have
entire possession and with plenty of food
was out of the auestion, for at opening
time they would be easy picking for the
yellow dogs of the neighborhood and fat
enough to kill, so after a deal of thinking
Griswold hit upon a novel plan and car
ried It out. Securing two pedigreed sheep
dogs from the drivers of Butchertown,
Griswold had them brought to the park
day after day to herd the bunch of hares.
The dogs took kindly to the work and
the hares, being handicapped by the clos
ing of the numerous escapes, were forced
to run themselves into condition that is
far and beyond that of tho new consign
ments. 'Â¦<- 'Â¦."Â¦'Â¦Â» ;â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦
given some hard trials. Day after day
it has been noticed that the hares, after
reaching the escapes, instead of availing
themselves of the opportunity to crawl
under the fence, have turned about and
taken the dogs another circuit around the
field.
As the fast reason approaches It has
become noticeable that the strong dogs,
rather than the clever ones, have man
aged to get the flag. So plainly has this
been shown that the wise trainers, who
are ever alert for an opportunity to win
fame and glory for their kennels and in
cidentally to add to their bank accounts
the big end of the heavy purses that are
now being offered, have begun to realize
that stamina is the requisite necessary in
the greyhound that is sent out for the
coin.
Many of the yachtsmen will cruise
to-morrow morning to the upper bay, the
tide, which floods until 2:20 p. m. at tha
harbor entrance, serving well for a run
to Paradise Cove, Marin Islands or Mc-
Nears Landing. Next Saturday the San

TO-DAY and to-morrow are open dates
on the programmes of the San Fran
cisco and Corinthian yacht clubs.
The managers of the Astoria regatta are
very desirous to receive a visit from some
San Francisco oarsmen and promise that
the accommodations will be all that can
be desired. Some complaints were made
about the treatment received last year,
but the oarsmen are assured that there
will be no ground for complaint this year.
It is probable that two or three crews
will journey northward next month.
It eeems certain that no oarsmen or
scullers from San Francisco wil! visit
Santa Barbara for the tournament. Two
or three crews would have been quite
willing to do so. but the arrangements
about expenses of transportation and ac
commodations were not satisfactory. The
breeze that blew from the Southland was
too hot to suit the local oarsmen.
In a few months the Alameda Boating
Club, which already has the best waters
for training purposes, will have a greatly
improved location on Oakland Creek. At
present the end of the float at low water
is surrounded by mud and it is impos
sible to launch a boat from the clubhouse
at certain states of the tide. The United
States Government, however, has just
concluded a contract with a San Jose
firm for dredging out a channel in San An
tonio estuary. When this work is accom
plished there will be eight feet of water
at the end of the club float at low tide.
The completion of the work will add
greatly to the convenience and pleasure
of the oarsmen and swimmers.
At a meeting held early In the week
the members of the Ariel Rowing Club
adopted a resolution calling upon the Pa
cific Association of the Amateur Athletic
Union to provide that the championship
r?ces be rowed in shells instead of in
barges. The South End Rowing Club and
the Dolphin Boating Club are In favor of
this and it Is almost certain that the
Olympic Boat Club and the University of
California Boating Association will be in
favor of it also. The rowing clubs on this
fide of the bav are much dissatisfied with
thi results of the regatta. The new Ala
meda barce is so much lighter than any
barge owned by the cftj;- clubs that they
feel at a great disadvantage, j The Ala
mrda club has been keeping ahead of the
other local clubs in the matter of boats
for about ten years past. The barge was
originally adopted for rowing here be
cause It was supposed to be a stronger
and more weatherly boat and more suit
able for rough and lumpy water than a
shell. But for many years all the rowing
races on this bay took place In shells and
the old-time oarsmen say that barges are
even less weatherly than shells, as they
fill and swamp more easily. Another dis
advantage is that barges are peculiar to
San Francisco and are used nowhere else
in the country. If shells are adopted it
will be possible for San Francisco crews
to compete in regattas at Astoria, Port
land, Vancouver. Victoria and other
places in boats of the same kind as those
in use there, and it will be much easier
than it is now to induce oarsmen from
other places to visit San Francisco to
compete in regattas here. At present it is
impossible for local oarsmen to establish
records or even to know how their rec
ords compare with others, as the barge
is an unknown craft elsewhere.
No crew or single scullers appeared
from the Stockton Athletic Association,
though a barge crew wag entered in the
senior and Intermediate classes and R.
Chapman In the senior shell event.
A crew composed of R. IC Varney,

tered from the Olympic Boat Club In the
intermediate and senior barge races, but
did not put in an appearance. A. II. Bul
lion was entered in the senior outrigged
fkiff race, but it is hardly likely that he
would have beaten his only competitor,
F. W. Ayers of the Alameda Boating
Club. He might, however, have appeared
to advantage in the junior outrigged skiff
race against E. B. Thorning and F. J.
Sherry, the latter of whom fell out of his
boat on the way home from the, stakes.
with a light breeze, and the races
were pulled off with commendable
promptitude, the three barge races were
the only events out of the seven making
up a full championship regatta that really
came to anything. The Alameda Boating
Club won the championships In the senior
and junior barge races and also in the
Junior outrigged skiff event. In only one
of the four event* that came off did the
representatives of the Alameda Boating
Club fail to take first place. This was
the intermediate barge race. The Ala
meda crew for this event had not had
enough practice and was undertrained.
Then the cockswain did not steer as good
a course In this event ap he might have
done. But the crew did not deserve to
win, not having trained long or faithfully
enough for a championship race.
The Alameda junior barge crew, on the
other hand, was an excellent one, having
practiced regularly for six weeks and
having received the best care from their
fellow members during the fortnight pre
ceding the regatta. All the members of
the crew were in fine trim and fit to pull
twice the distance. The Alameda Club
representatives rowed in the new barge,
built by Al Rogers. It is the lightest
Srur-oared barged yeV constructed and
cost $450. It is the f^test boat of its
class on the waters of San Francisco Bay.

A report comes from Los Angeles to
the effect that President Garrat of thÂ©
Los Angeles club did not resign because
of the change In the schedule, as report
ed, but he had so much other business to
attend to that he could not do the club

The Los Angeles team will win a great
many more games from now on. The two
new players from Princeton University.
Hildebrand and Steinwald, are now with
the club and will strengthen It greatly.
Hildebrand Is a pitcher and one of th*
very bÂ«Â«t in the business. "When with the
famous Princeton Tigers two years ago
he made a great record, and many of tha
big league clubs were after him.
Steinwald is a second baseman and one
of the fastest fielders who ever trotted
on a college diamond. He is also a good
man with the stick, arfd wil undoubtedly
win many a game for Reilly ere the sea

MORE STAR PLATERS.
Seattle Is also turning out immense crowds,
and the fans there seem to have gone wild
over Dugdale's team. Every club in thÂ»
league is playing fast baseball, and that Is one
of the reasons why the people are patronizing
the games so liberally.
There is absolutely no truth In thÂ« rumor
that the Ia*t game of ball, for this season at
least, has been played at the Xhun-street park.
We will be back here on August 2tÂ». opening
up with the Seattle team. The season closes
on October 11. and we Intend to stay right
in the fight till the end. and our chances of
winning out row are brighter than ever â that
I am certain of.
One of the reasons why the schedule was
changed was to give the people, more ball in
the Northwest. At the very start the fans
there kicked at the schedule, saying they
would not see enough ball to suit them, and
that all the action would come off In Califor
nia. The schedule was arranged In a big
hurry, so after a great deal of consideration
we decided that we would remain north an
extra month and give the people what they
were craving for.
Then the weather conditions have a great
deal to do with the change la the schedule.
If we did not play up there now and next
month, we really would lose all the profit in thÂ«
northern country, for as soon as the rains set

end. while ball can be played here and in L03
Angeles all the year round.
GREAT CROWDS AT SEATTLE.
PRESIDENT HARRY HART of tha
San FraAclsco Nationals returned
from the meeting of the leagued
magnates in Tacoma a few days
ago. Hart states that everything at tho
meeting: was satisfactory to him. as well
as to the other magnates, and that tha
outlook for the league is brighter than
at any other time since tha season
opened. He said:
We are certainly havln* everything cur

tendance has been and Is at present a great
deal better than we ever dreamed of. All thÂ«
clubs are now making: money and biff money,
and we expect to quit the season a winner
by many thousands of dollars.
In Tacoma the attendance at all the camn
has been exceedingly large â larger In fact
that I could believe until I Â»aw for myself.
Although the Tigers are now a winning team
by long odds, still the fans have gone base
tall mad and turn out In droves at every
game. For a town of only 60.000 people. I
think It is the greatest baseball center In tha
country.

Higglns, the Irrepressible, curly-headed
steeplechase rider, Foster Jones and two
or three other owners Kot in here from
the Denver meeting^yestcrday. Higglns,
in referring to the Colorado meet, said,
"Any time we 'shooed' one in we picked
the best horse," and this in his mind con
stituted honest sport.
Hllderbrand, who continues to ride in
excellent form, had a fall while riding
Troy in a race on the Fourth of July, but
-as the track was mud the little fellow es
caped Injury. As Hilderbrand has a very
energetic manager in Vic Gilbert, it is
the general consensus of opinion that in
many races the youngster is the "medi
cine man." The. mounts of Hilderbrand
are always heavily supported and in
many of the events in which they are re
turned first some of the other riders ap
pear afflicted with a feeling of ennui that
is really alarming. There is one thing the
Seattle sport does like and that is "an
ace In the hole." To this fact can be as
cribed the popularity of Hilderbrand. On
an equal break the local gambler will not
bet he is alive, unless he first consults a
physician.
As "shoo-ins" were becoming tediously
frequent the judges one day last week
posted a bulletin in the ring to the effect
that R. Sullivan was ruled off the turf,
and Jockeys Tullett and Ashley were sus
pended for the balance of the meeting.
Sullivan was brought here by Ed Kripp
of Sacramento and the latter threatens
unless his rider is restored to good stand
ing to take the matter into the courts.
Kripp claims to be $?000 loser on the meet-
Ing and would undoubtedly have found
it more profitable had he journeyed to
Chicago and backed his horse Beau Or
monde.
Hill Alexander, well known to San
Francisco race goers, who was injured
in a trolley car accident some weeks ago
while returning from the races, died at
a hospital in this city Saturday last. Hen
ry Rich, another Friscoite, who received
injuries at the same time, is able to be
about. The railroad company has of
fered Rich $1200 as a balm for his hurts,
but he is holding out for $1SOO.
people attended the racing at Â«The
lleadows, which speaks very w^ell for the
sport loving qualities of the natives here.
Eight running events were decided, the
books handling altogether about $50,000,
of which sum $12,000 represented the win
ningra of the syndicate. Horatlus, the fa
vorite, carrying 109 . and ridden by Ira
Powell, took the principal fixture of the
card, the Celebration handicap, at one
and a quarter miles, beating Fossil, with
Hllderbrand up, a short nose. The Sat
urday previous Fossil finished two lengths
before Horatius for the Club Members*
handicap over one and an eighth miles,
owing to a bungling ride given the last
named colt by Alarie, Powell being on the
hospital list with a lame hand. Probably
the best break the book had on the
Fourth was when Mocorito finished ahead
of Glendenning. Sad Sam and E. M. Brat
tain (in Owners' handicap at 5 to S). Mo
corito at 4 was practically friendless, the
crowd unloading on Sad Sara and Glen
denning. The latter two sprinters went
out in front at a terrltlc clip and when
both began tiring about 100 yards from
home Holbrook, until this occasion a
maiden rider, slipped through on the rail
with Mocorito, beating Glendenning a
length.
With the exception of the continuation
of the warfare begun at Oakland last
winter between D. Cameron and T. Well
man, there has been little or no boosting
indulged in by. owners of selling' platers.
On June 25 Sheilmount won a five-eighths
mile scramble and when Wellman bid the
gelding up from $300 to $S00 Cameron did
not protect his entry. Wellman took the
chestnut over to Vancouver a few days
later and as his new purchase picked up
about $S00 in purses he feels' that he did
not grab the burnt end of the stick. Cam
eron retaliated by taking The Pride for
$S00 on July 3, after the old Ryan sprinter
had taken a six-furlong event in a gallop.
The win of the Dominion day. handicap
over one and a quarter miles at Vancou
ver by C. W. Chappell's Caronal with 105
pounds up, was a great shock to the Ca
nadian contingent. The latter love to un
limber on a short priced one as a hungry
dog likes a bone, and as"Pat Morrissey,
whose owner is well known over the line,
was backed to 1 to 3, it is not difficult
to imagine" the disappointment at the hot
favorite"s downfall. Pat, ridden by Lin
ton, twisted one of his plates and
Caronal proved an easy winner. Indeed,
Vassallo finished a neck before the tirst
choice for .place, 'tis claimed, but the
judges got the colors mixed and Morris
sey was awarded that position. * â¢
A story is going the rounds here that
Carson, who is "on the ground" for get
ting left at the post with Redwald. is sail
ing under false colors.'. It is said Cax
eon's real name is Farnum and that af
ter running away from "Snapper" Gar
rison in New York the boy rode on some
of the Eastern outlaw tracks, where he
was eventually ruled off. The story lacks
corroboration, however.

â¢ Without exaggeration it was the pret
tiest exhibition of the national rastime
i hat has been passed out upon the local
field In so many moons that one can hard
iy count them.
But the result was not satisfactory so
far as merits were concerned. Young
Cutter, who was appointed to pass up the
curves for the Senators, twirled a game
That would have done credit to any star
in the business, and yet an unfortunate
<rror lost the g^me for him, despite his
Vrilliant efforts.
Only two safe hits were made off the
delivery of the youngster and one of
them was exceedingly scratchy. He did
r.ot pass a man to first on balls nor hit a
batsman and never fcr a moment did he
rase up In his speed. He had curves and
r bewildering change of pace, and. Judg
ing from the way he pitched the nine
Innings, he could have gone as many
more without the slightest effort.
Hodson. for the home team, also went
pome himself, and although his work xrsg'
far from being up to the standard of the
jour.g college man's, still he worked well
enough to shut the Senators out without
a run. Then he had the support which
the youngster lacked at the critical mo
ment, as not one of his backers com
tritted the slightest semblance of an
error during the game.
Meany opened the ninth inning for the
locals and new to center. Then Captain
Charley Irwin advasced to the plate and
after a deal of experimenting with fouls,
drove out a long single to center. Krug's
out advanced him to second. Then Pabst
shot one down to Townsend and the lat
ter allowed the ball to go right through
him and out into right field. Irwin tore
around the bags and landed safely at the
plate ere the ball could be thrown to the
waiting hands of Graham, and the game
was over for keeps.
Just an hour and seventeen minutes
were required to finish the contest and
this record makes it one of the fastest
played at Recreation Park this season.
It was punctuated throughout with bright

ers and cattlemen in different parts -of
the State complaining of the Iorpps
caused them by bears and lions. In each
case we were invited to spend our vaca
tion in the neighborhood of the writer
and do some shooting. We accepted the
invitation of one man who dwelt near
Calistoga. He went straight to the point,
saying:
Phllo Jacoby, "the sharpshooter, left the
city yesterda, for a hunting trip. His
destination is near Ukiah, Mendocino
County. He will be away for two weeks!
On his way to the ferry with less para
phernalia than the usual huntsman car
ries Jacoby said that two friends of hisâ
brothersâ own adjoining ranches in Men
docino and that they were anndyed by
bear and California lions, that made
nightly raids on their cattle.
"They want me to go up there and kill
some of the 'varmint,' " he said, chuck
ling. "So I'm going there with my old
time 44-55 Winchester to see what I can
do and have a little needed recreation. I
suppose I'm traveling under false pre
tenses, for I don't think I can handle the
gun as I used to. This gun, too," he
added, "is not like the new-fangled_
weapons now In use, but It has stood by
me many times in years gone by.'when I
came back with big bags of game, large
and small.

- The Mayor said he took the position
that public necessity demanded the oper
ation of the telephone system: that it
could not be properly operated unless the
company could ' keep linemen at work;
that the employes â¢ now in the service
would not work without police protection;
that while there was no evidence that
strikers had assaulted these men, there
was danger of disturbances unless protec
tion were given.
City Engineer Turner and City Attor
ney McElroy were present during the
meeting. but,.Mayor Olney, under the
powers conferred by the city charter,
took full responsibility for his decision
upon himself alone. He announced that
he would keep the police on duty, but
would withdraw them if it were shown to
him during the next few days that all
danger of molestation of telephone com
pany employes had passed.
The Mayor declined to listen to* an at
torney for the linemen, preferring to hear
from the immediate representatives. Ed
Davis, for the strikers, said the linemen
had not assaulted any of the company's
men, and E. W. Petry, for the Federated
Trades, reasserted the argument that po
lice protection was unnecessary. J. P.
Burke of the Laborers' Piotectlve Union,
who was recently beaten at Berkeley by
George and William Schmidt, contractors,
made a demand for personal protection,
and denounced his Honor because Mayor
Olney said Burke's case was not in line
with that under discussion.
â¢ Robert Flemming. superintendent of con
struction of the telephone company, and
Eugene J. Ellis, manager of the Alameda
County department, cUed instances
where striking linemen had been abusive,
to the point of much vulgarity, to em
ployes, and declared that in one case an
arrest had been prevented only by the
flight of .a striker.
The chief contention of the strikers'
representatives was that the police guard
was a reflection on the men as law-abid
ing citizens.
When he gave his decision, the Mayor
said:
"This police guard was established as a
precautionary measure. It Is necessary
to prevent violence that the telephone
system shall be kept in working order.
While there is no evidence that the strik
ers have been violent, the fact remains
that without police protection employes
of the telephone company are in danger.
I have no doubt of the ability of Mr!
Davis to control his men. but he cannot
handle outsiders. I shall be only too glad
to order off the' police as soon as U Is
shown to me that need for Ihe guard is
unnecessary and that depends upon the
action of the men during the next few
days."
With that the conference adjourned.

Will Allen was well liked among the
newspaper fraternity, in fact, among all
people who came into touch with him.
Ills courage under the most trying of af
flictionâalmost total blindnessâ was his
most endearing quality. He groped his
way about the world, led often by the
hands of his friends, struggling for the
support of himself and the partial sup
port of his aged parents. The certainty
that the affection of the retina from
which he suffered was slowly but surely
darkening the world to him did not stifle
his naturally hopeful disposition and he
was constantly dreaming of the time
when his genius as a story writer would
lift him out of the daily grind of news
paper work. â¢ Â¦.
Only a moment before his fatal fall he
was talking hopefully of some children's
stories he proposed to send to an Eastern
publication. He had promised to read
these stories last night to a few of his
literary friends, but the trip to Oakland
was proposed and the reading was post
poned to another time. '
STORIES ARE OF .MERIT.
Allen's friends hurried back to find him,
expecting only to see his dead .body. He
was alive, however, but unconscious. The
next car returning to Oakland was hailed
and the broken body of the unfortunate
young man taken to the Receiving Hos

a great gash on the forehead and the left

safety and then paid no more attention,
thinking he was engaged lighting his
cigarette. A moment or two later, how
ever, they were brought to a realization
of an accident by the sudden stopping' of
the car and the exclamation of the motor

After Miss Beyland was safely en
sconced in her room Sellers summoned
the Rev. P. F. Bresee to perform the de
layed' ceremony. Then he went to the
house of "Cupid" Kutz and for a liberal
consideration induced veteran Eros to go
to the courthouse and issue a marriage
license. While approaching his rooni on
the third floor of the Van Nuys Sellers
met Brother Beyland, who was in a fu
rious mood. Detective Mclntyre says of
the ensuing altercation:
"I reached the hall in time to see Bey
land grapple with Sellers. He was en
deavoring to wrench the marriage license
from Sellers' hand. I ran up just as Bey
land reached for his back pocket and I
grasped his hand Just as It closed on a re
volver. Beyland cried, 'Police,' and made
a great racket. The porters and clerks
rushed In and separated us and Beyland
went away."
At 8:30 o'clock Sellers and Miss Bey
land were married and left the city last
evening. They will proceed to , Knoxville
to receive thg Judge's blessing and pos
sibly Papa Beyland's forgiveness. Sellers
is 23 years of age and a handsome youth.
His bride Is a beautiful brunette of 20.
LOS ANGELES. July 10.â Having fol
lowed the girl of hfs choice all the way
from Kncxville'to Los Angeles, whither
she had been brought by relatives who
opposed her marriage, R. E. Lee Sellers
found her here, braved her relatives and,
despite the fact that her brother made a
gun play, married the girl and is now
speeding' eastward to secure parental for
.giveness from those she left at home.
The groom is a son of Judge W. M. Sel
lers of the Criminal Court of lvnox Coun
ty. Tennessee, and the bride the daughter
of Superintendent Beyland of the Knox
vllle Iron Company. The objec
tions to Sellers- on the part of
the girl's relatives do not appear,
but learning that she had promised to
marry him her parents sent her away in
charge of a brother and other relatives
without Sellers knowing whither she had
gone. She attempted to write to him, but
her letters were intercepted and he re
ceived no news from her. He engaged a
detective and -the sleuth learned where
the girl had been taken. Then Sellers
told his father of the matter.
"Father handed me $1000 in cash and
told me to find her if I could and marry
her hi desired," said Sellers last night
after the wedding. He traced the girl
and her custodians to Chicago. Kansas
City. Salt, Lake. San Francisco and final
ly to Los Angeles. He was accompanied
by a Knoxville detective named Mclntyre
and, although they searched several days,
they had almost given up hope of find
ing the gjrl.
Detective Mclntyre finally found the
persons sought had been living at 718 1 ,*
Ruth avenue, but had removed yesterday
morning. He found the girl's brother was
working in the machine department of
the Pacific Electric Railway Company,
and he shadowed the young man to 806
Hill street. Through a young woman who
had grown friendly to . Miss Beyland it
was ascertained that the girl was work
ing at the Broadway,- department store,
and there young Sellers found her just
as the store was closing. It was a happy
reunion. The girl agreed to an immedi
ate marriage and her lover took her to
the Van Nuys Hotel, where she registered
as Minnie Sullins and secured room 520.
Meantime Mclntyre kept waich on the
brother to see if he got wlmT of the af

crowd nervous over the Government report
which was expected to reduce previous estl

late in the afternoon, and showed a condition
of 78%c for Winter Wheat and 82%c for
Spring. These figures Indicate a crop of less
than 700,000,000 bushels, whereas a month or
so ago 750,000.000 bushels was expected Dur
ing the past day or two, however, the thresh
ing returns have been coming In so poorly that
the estimates had been cut to 715,000,000, so
the reDort was not a surprise and had been
largely discounted. Good outside buying kept
the market strong. Crop returns were poorer,
even from Kansas, which has heretofore been
making a .brilliant showing. The Missouri
millers are still complaining of the poor thresh
ing returns.

publication of <?Btlmates of the weekly cash
cnanges. which showed an excess of receipts
over Khipmcnts in the Interior movement of
over S3.O00.0CO. This is larger than the $2,758.
â¢, ioss on Bub-treasury operations, thus indi
cating a small net cash Rain by the banks.
To-morrow e gold shipments of $2,600,000. how
ever do not figure in this estimate. The large
receipts on balance from the Interior were a
decided surprise in view of the movement of
interior exchange markets. The grain mar
icets reflected the large closing up of accounts
in expectation of the appearance of the monthly

speculators in stocks were not able to get much
light en the crop situation from the movement
of tne grain markets. The market closed about

Joseph. Kirk, son of Michael Kirk, who

were known he admitted'that several at
tempts had been made to wreck trains.
He said:
There have been several attempts made to
wreck our trains on the up-country branch,
and If possible we propose to arrest and con
vict the guilty ones. We. did not care to let
the matter become public, as it would hurt
the road, and would also hamper our detec
tion in their work. â¢ . /
As far back as two months ago . we found
obstructions on our right-of-way, but the first
serious offense wag July 2. Our. track-walker,
Valentine Germanlnl, who has charge of the
track. above San Anselmo. reported that day
that he had found a piece of rail upon the
track. We had the steel sent here and still
have it In our possession. The obstruction was
discovered upon the track north of Pistolesi.
Fortunately a wreck was averted.
Yesterday . morning up-country passenger
train No 1 collided with a heavy "drawhead,"
and a serious wreck was only averted by the
watchfulness of Engineer Cannady. The train
went up "heavy" yesterday morning with San
Franciscans en route 1 to the 'various . Bummer
resorts.
The obstruction was placed yesterday within
a mile of where the' attempt' was made July
2, near Pistolesi. The engine went over the
obstruction, as the dent in the steel will Indi
cate. How it was she did not topple over Is
strange, as the "drawhead" was set so as to
bring about 8 bad smash-up.
The train was not delayed any length of
time, and the company is very fortunate in
not having sustained very serious loss by this
attempt.
It is quite possible that the recent wrecks
were, due to obstructions " having been ' placed
on the rails. We have been unable to discover
any cause for those wrecks. They were so
complete that we could not find anything to
definitely show their cause.

a right to repair the same.
The Commissioners evidently fear that
the building will be again used for theat
rical purposes. Mr. Lankershim has been
advised by his counsel that the Commis

â¢ Some time ago a track walker discov
ered a piece of cordwood on the rails, but
removed It. He paid but little attention
to the matter, thinking the log had been
j6lted off one of the engines. On July 2,
while examining the roadbed to the north
of Camp Pistolesi, he found a piece of
steel rail weighing fifty pounds lying
alongside of the rails. It was fastened to
the rail with heavy copper wire and made
a most dangerous obstruction. Upon ex
amining the steel he discovered a deep
indentation where car wheels had passed
over It. One end of the steel had broken
loose. It Is believed that when the en
gine truck struck It one side of the fas
tenings gave way and thus saved the
train from being derailed. This attempt
to wreck the train was reported to the
railroad officials. Later a report was re
ceived that a down : country freight had
passed over an obstruction on the night
of July 1." The locomotive â¢ was a heavy

work of train wreckers. It was learned
to-day that on three occasions within the
last two weeks obstructions have been
placed on the tracks and serious acci
dents were averted through the watch
fulness of the track walker. The up
country Cazadero passenger train yester
day morning struck a large steel "draw
head," securely placed upon the rails.
Engineer Cannady did not see the ob
struction in time to bring the train to a
full stop, and before he fully realized the
danger the forward trucks of the loco
motive had passed over the steel barrier
and jumped the track. The air brakes,
however, prevented the train of six cars,
loaded with passengers, from going over
an embankment and into the river bed.
The last two attempts at derailment
were made upon curves, near Camp Pis

OFFICIALS ARE RETICENT.
The â¢ train was running 'about twenty
miles an hour and was due at Camp Pis
tolesi at 10:45 o'clock. When within
about a half-mile of the station and
while running along the river bank and
winding around reverse curves. Engineer
Cannady noticed something on the. track
which at first glance appeared/ to .be. a
log. He threw on the airbrakes,^ but was
unable to stop his engine until after he
struck the obstruction. The front truck
of the engine struck the bar, jumped up
and left the rails, but before the main
drive wheels hit it the j engine was
brought to a standstill.
The passengers in the cars were badly
frightened by the sudden stopping of the
train. .The engine was soon righted and
the train proceeded to Cazadero without
further accident. Â¦ Y*\v^
It was the up country Cazadero passen;
ger train that collided with the , "draw
head" yesterday morning. The train con
necting with the boat leaving San Fran
cisco at 7:45 o'clock yesterday morning
was on time. Conductor A. B. Murray
was in charge and Engineer J. II. Can

cab. Six cars made up the .train and
more than 100 passengers occupied the

tailed detectives upon the case. While
the sleuths were at work a larger and
more dangerous obstruction was placed
upon the track within a short distance of
where the attempt was made July 2.. An
iron drawhead about three feet long, six
inches in thickness and weighing 152
pounds, was found fastened to the outside
rail on a curve.
BETTER THAU" A BANK.
What sound judgment and years of
practical experience can accomplish was
never better exemplified than has been
done by Mr. Joseph A. Leonard, the well
known architect and builder, who as
manager of the San Francisco and Sub
urban Â¦ Home Building Society has just
announced a dividend of 13 per cent on Its
first year's business.
As one result of twenty years of expe
rience in the building business, latterly in
Alameda County, where he erected and
sold homes to the value of over three
quarters of a million dollars, Mr. Leon
ard conceived the idea that the interest
of both investor and homeseeker would
be best served by combining a money
loaning business with that of all
branches of actual homebuilding. A great
saving resulting from centralizing in one
company all the service, instead of scat
tering profits and commissions among
many. With sufficient capital to prove
his theory of concentration, the above
company was formed, and a 12 per cent
dividend was brought about by the so
ciety becoming Its own banker, or money
lending concern, supplying the lot. the
legal work, the architecture, the building,
the fire insurance and, finally, securing
at minimum rates the best form of life
insurance, in order to protect both the
home buyer and itself, so that the profits
hitherto divided among many have accum
ulated by this one concern and made pos
sible larger profits to the Investor, al
though the house cost the homeseeker
less than obtainable elsewhere.
Mr. Leonard expresses confidence In the
society's ab'ility, through the readjust
ment of homebuilding methods and
concentration of all the branches connect
ed therewith, to keep up the payment of
large dividends. These methods are open
to the closest investigation at Its offices

Death of an Army Veteran.
SAN JOSE. July 10.â Charles W. TVood

ever of a convention held either for purposes
of nomination or for purposes of selection of
a county or governing committee. It may Be,
and I am informed, it is a fact that a public
assemblage gathered In which these nominees
were in some manner agreed upon, as well as
the names of the committee, but there never
was any legal convention of an organized poli
tical body by that or any similar name tm
after the date of said petition. This fact Is
recognized In the petition Itself, which al
though tiled long after this public assemuiage.
made no claim whatsoever that any conven
tion had ever been held by the Union Labor
party. Th<*. pet-Mon proceeds upon the theory
that the nominees are entitled to a place upon
the ballot not by reason of any political con
vention, but by reason of selection by at least
three per cent of the vote cast at the last
preceding election, which, indeed, was a fact.
It la clear, therefore, that those who presented
or filed said petition did not consider that a
convention had ever been. held. . In fact. Â¦ If
such â¢ convention had been held and properly
held then there would have been no need of a
petition. The petition is only presented under
the terms of section 11SÂ» of the Political Code,
which Is a section providing for "nominations
otherwise than by convention." It would be
absurd in the face of thesÂ«s facts to claim that
up to that time, viz.: October, 1001. there had
been any legal convention which designated
these gentlemen as members of a committee
of any character.
2. Section 11S6 of the Political Code provides
that with certain exceptions not here involved
a county committee selected by a convention
continues as such for two years. So far as I
am advised there Is no legal record of any
convention of the Union Labor party until
September. 1902. It is not claimed that the
Ewell-Aubertine committee was selected by
the convention of 1902. but It Is conceded that
the Harders-Berger committee was selected by
that convention. It only remains, therefore,
to determine whether the convention of 1002
was a local .convention of the Union Labor
party. This inquiry. Is also answered by the
uncontested documents of the Union Labor
party Itself on tile In your office.
What is a local convention for purposes of
primary election law. Is denned in section 1353
of the Political Code In the following lan
guage: . "Conventions to nominate candidates
for county or city and county offices. Judges
of the Superior Court or Justices of the Peace
In' any city and county and members of the
Senate and Assembly representing districts
wholly within one county or city and county.
Supervisors and all township officers, will be
hereinafter In this chapter designated as local
conventions." The convention of the Union
Labor party In lÂ»02 admittedly was for the
purpose of nominating many of the officers
Just recited, and the certificate of nomination
filed by the Union Labor party In the office of
the Registrar September 30. 1902, specifically
enumerates them. Furthermore. It ta recited
in the certificate last mentioned that the as
semblage which nominated such officers was
"the Union Labor party local convention for
said city and county of San Francisco. State
of California." and the petition of the Union
Labor party filed in the Registrar's office June
30. 1002, requesting a place upon the primary
election ballot for the primary election Au
gust, 1902, recites In five different places that
the convention to be held and for which they
desired representation upon the primary ballot
was a "local convention." This was the con
vention which selected the ' Harders-Berger
committee. -. ' â¢"
It appears to me, therefore, upon the facts
presented, that the first governing committee
was a; temporary one. whose existence ex
pired upon the appointment of & committee by
the local convention of the Union Labor party,
and that the only designation of a committee
by the Union Labor party convention was the
designation of the committee hereinbefore re
ferred to as the Harders- Berger committee.
Respectfully. GEORGE W. LANE.

This law jÂ» to those of many
other States and is aimed to have the
public benefit to some degree by the
wealth nf those who amass gTeat for
tunes. Under the constitution of the
United States, if a man may make $1000
there is no way in which one may be
prevented from piling up 11.000,000.000. It
is the policy of much legislation, how
ever.- that t uch men may not perpetuate
their fortunes, but that, at death, a great
er or less amount may be given to the
public.
In settling the estate of one Mahoney
the Supreme Court decided recently that
the portion of the quoted law respecting
resident nephews and nieces was invalid
end that all such relatives of testators
must pay the collateral inheritance tax.
In the matter of the estate of J. C. John
son, the case at bar, the court reverses
itself and further exempts nephews and
nieces who may reside in sister States.
The decision of the trial court declared
that all nephews and nieces must pay the
tax. Resident and non-resident nephews
then, appealed. They have secured a re
versal and may have their- legacies free
of the duty.
The opinion is written by Justice Hen
tshaw. with whom Justices Shaw, Angel
lptti. Lorigan. McFarland and Van Dyke
directly concur. Chief Justice Beatty
writes a. dissenting opinion.
The Supreme Court decided yesterday
also that the $3502 83 left by James Miner
in 1S75 rightfully belongs to the State.
Twenty years after Miner's death and
â¢when the estate had been settled an heir
appeared and brought suit against the
State Controller for the recovery of the
money. A majority of the court holds
that the heir was too long about present
ing the claim. Chief Justice Beatty dis
sents.
The vital portion of the collateral in
hetitar.ee tax law of 1S93, as amended in
IS97. is as follows:
After the passage o< this act all property
Â¦which ehall pass by will â¢ â¢ â¢ other than
to the uee oj his or her father, mother, hus
band, wife, lawful irsue. brother, sister and
nitros Â«w nephew* when a resident of this
State. â¢ â¢ â¢ shall toe and is subject to a
tax of five cellars on every one hundred dol
lar* of the market valu/> of euch property
" â¢ â¢ lor the use at the State, â¢ â¢ â¢ pro
vified that an *-Ftat<> which may be valued at a
\t-rt sum than five hundred dollars shall not be
subject to such duty or tax.
ThÂ»Â» scope of the collateral inheritance
tax was narrowed by the Supreme Court
yesterday but the art was not wholly
Invalidated, as was expected by many
of the State's Iega4 authorities. Xephews
and nieces of tettaxors can secure their
legacies free of tha impost, provided that
they are legal residents of California or
any other State in this country. Such
rclatlvrs who may live in Territories or
foreign lands must pay the reauired 5
jkt rent .on money or property left to
them. The court stands six to one for
this decision.
1. As heretofore stated, your communication
recites tWat the Ewell-Aubertine committee
only claims by virtue of its designation in a
petition which first placed the Union Labor
nominees upon the official ballot. This pre
cludes the Idea of their selection by any con
vention. The records of your office confirm
this statement, as well as all the documents
filed by the Union Labor party. In the peti
tion of three per cent of the electors, hereto
fore referred to and which may be said to
have inaugurated the Union Labor party in
San Francisco, both Ewell and Aubertlne were
signers. That petition makes no mention what-
Two questions therefore arise: (1) Whether
the Ewell-Aubertine committee was selected
by convention? (2) Was the convention which
admittedly selected the Harders-Berger com
mittee a local convention?
The code section above mentioned which pro
vides-for. the creation of the flret governing
committee by petition does not name any pe
riod of. time whatever during which the com
mittee may exist. It must be conceded. I
think, that the governing committee selected In
a petition of a party theretofore unorganized
Is essentially but a temporary body, and that If
thereafter the party becomes duly organlzei
and a local convention thereafter selects a
county committee, the latter committee takes
the place of the committee selected by the peti
tion.
The Harders-Berger committee claims right
to represent the party locally by virtue of ap
pointment by the Union Labor party conven
tion held at San Francisco in September, 1002,
and, the fact of such appointment seems to be
conceded.
G. W. Lane, acting City Attorney in the
absence of Franklin K. Lane, advi3e3 the
Board of Election Commissioners that
the Harders-Berger committee of the
Union Labor party is entitled to recogni
tion as the governing body of that party.
This decision Is a straw In favor of* the
Union Labor faction headed bv Michael
Casey. The rival organization â the
Ewell-Aubertine faction-is supposed to
represent the supporters of Mayor
Schmitz and Fire Commissioner Parry.
Following is the text of the opinion
rendered to the Election ' Commissioners
by the acting City Attorney:

body of said political party in said city anl
county of San Francisco; the other petition is
signed by August Harders as chairman and
George J. Berger as secretary of a committee
of like name.
There is apparently no question as to thj
right of the Union Labor party to a place upoi?
the primary election ballot. The only question
is which committee legally represents that
party.
From your communication to me It appears
that the Kwell-Aubertlne committee claims to
be the governing committee solely by virtue of
the fact that It was so designated in a certain
petition illed in your office on October 5, liJOl,
under section 1U>S of the Political Code. The
petition last named was one purporting to be
signed by at least 3 per cent of the entire vote
cast at the' last election preceding its date and
requesting-' that .certain candidates therein
named should be placed upon the official ballot
at the election to be held In November, 1901.
The petition further designated twenty-five per
sons to constitute a governing committee. AH
of these matteis are required by section 11SS
of the Political Code.
