REDDING, Dec. 9. â The bodies of
two horses driven by five men, four of
whom were drowned by mistaking a
road and driving Into the Sacramento
River near Middle Creek Station last
night, were recovered from" the stream
this ' morning. A two-seated buggy
was also pulled out of the water, but
none, of the bodies of the men were
recovered, although the stream was
dragged for them.
Charles Diestlchorst of this city is
positive that one of the drowned men
was his nephew, William Knudson, of
Redding. He knows that young Knud
son got into the rig here to go to Kes
wick. He says his nephew had been
going under an assumed name at Kes
wick and believes the name to be Wil
liam Weiner, the name that was given
out in the list of victims. It was at
first thought that possibly Knudson
made the sixth member of the ill-fated
party and that five were drowned, but
H. Fitzpatrick, the sole suYvivor, says
there .were only four besides himself
in the ri^. If Knudspn was in the
party he was probably the one known
as Weiner.

Dr. Herran, . the Colombian Charge
d'Affalres, to-day authorized the state
ment that if "troops from Cartagena
had , landed -near the mouth of the
Atrata River, as , by r the
Fren6h steamer which has arrived at
La Guayra, it was directly in opposi
tion to the, advice of both. himself and
General : Reyes.
General Reyes has been fully in
formed by the President himself as to
the. intentions V of , the Government of
the United States" respecting ;the ; isth
mus. HeHwas^told by. the President
that, as was set- forth in j the Presi
dent's "message to Congress, the United
Stales had determined .to : maintain the
independence of ; the new - republic.' of.
Panama ; against all r comers. While
this guarantee, is contained in a, treaty
how pending before the United States

Although the statement heretofore
has been* denied, it is learned that the
department has taken notice of the re
peated reports ; that Colombian troops
were assembling at different . points
with the avowed purpose of making a
hostile demonstration against Pan
ama, and has perfected all military
plans to repeal such an invasion.
General Young said . that, should he
be called upon to assist the. navy, it
would not be necessary" to send to the
isthmus more than a' regiment or two.
Although . none of the : members of the
joint army and navy board, which met
to-day, would admit that the Isthmian
situation was under' discussion, it Is
known that such was the case and that
both the army and the navy are ,now
in a state of preparedness for any con
flict with . Colombia that may arise.
It is probable that the training ship
Prairie, with a battalion of marines
aboard, will be ordered to Colon. Â¦ The
vessel is now at Guantanamo.

guaranteed to keep transit across the

It has repeatedly been reported that
the Russians have, been fortifying
Yongampho, on the Yalu River, but
the reports to this effect appear to have
been greatly exaggerated. Japan and.
Great Britain on October 17, according
to a dispatch from Peking, asked for
the opening of Yongampho to the com
merce of the world, and the Korean
Foreign Minister consented, subject to
the approval of the Emperor of Korea,
which was withheld, owing, it wa3
said, to a strenuous protest made by
the Russian Minister to Korea, M.
Pavloff, although this subsequently
was denied. Korea was then said to
have strongly objected to Russia's in
terference as being a violation of Ko
rea's sovereign rights. Later It was
asserted that Japan insisted on recog
nition of h<;r influence in Korea, and
the opening of Ycngampho or other
ports to foreign trade. A dispatch from
St. , Petersburg on November 27 said
Russia was willing to concede some
thing, but she opposed the opening of
Yongampho. on account of its proxim
jty'to the mouth of the Yalu Rlrer,
taking the ground that It would
threaten her interests and complicate
her difficulties in Manchuria. SomÂ«i
days later it was announced that Ad
miral Alexieff, the Russian Viceroy in
the. Far East, had sent a number cf
warships to Chemulpo.
A dispatch' from Seoul. Korea, on De
cember 5 announced that American
Minister Allen that day had a long in
terview with the Emperor of. Korea on
the subject of the request of the United
States for the opening of Wiju, on th*Â»
Yalu, to the commerce of the world.
The Korean Government, It was added,
had been placed in a dilemma by the
demand of the. United States, it was
pointed out at the time the dispatch of
December 5 was received from Seoul
that Wiju was selected by the United
States as a prospective port instead of
Yongampho. because, lying forty miles
above the latter port, the country with
in that limit would be likewise opened
to traffic, and neutralized, a substantial
gain In the extent of market afforded.
CALL BUREAU, 1406 G STREET N.
W., WASHINGTON. Dec. 9.â Because
the Department of Commerce and La
bor, with its inquisitorial Bureau of
Corporations, has been the storm center
of the Standard Oil opposition to Presi
dent Roosevelt, peculiar interest awaits
the publication* of the first annual re
port of Secretary Cortelyou, which was
given to the press to-night. Secretary
Cortelyou does not even attempt to
thinly veil the purpose of his depart
ment to carry out the law with refer
ence to great corporations, whether
they be good or bad, but to do nothing
rash. He calls attention to the fact
that the creation of the Bureau of Cor
porations was- viewed by some with
suspicion and that it was feared the
powers granted to it might be used
hastily to the injury of legitimate en
terprise. No such purpose, he says,
will control the administration of the
law. Secretary Cortelyou uses this lan
guage in announcing his purpose of
carrying out the intent of the law:
â¢.'Many corporations have been grant
ed important privileges by the public
land some of these 'corporations,
through consolidation ; of , capital, have
acquired extensive lnfluej!ic& In JheJJn
dustrial affairs of the country. These
privileges, if ] improperly;, used, = not only
retard -the, progress of industry, but
frequently breed corruption in politics.
"The" legislation creating the Bureau
of Corporations was an expression of
the popular belief that further safe
guards should be provided for the regu
lation of business enterprises to which
special privileges have been granted
by the people. Publicity will disclose
unfair dealings, dishonesty anfc corrup
tion, but, if properly enforced, will not
disclose to trade competitors the fruits
of individual thrift and initiative, nor
permit in any other manner the inva
sion of private rights."
In rehearsing the operations of the
Department cf Commerce^icce it came
into existence on July 1, St-retary Cor
telyou puts at rest the rumors that the
Bureau of Corporations had already
come into collision with the Standard
Oil Company and that the Rockefeller
corporation had refused to give infor
mation demanded by the department.

The court has already taken evidence
of 566 witnesses. One of the leading
counsel, M. Smakoff. handed his' brief
to ; a colleague because he was jepm
pellcd to go to Moscow on official
business. This gave rise to a report
that the counsel for the defens^had

. "In declaring, that a Russo-Japanese
settlement is immediately at hand, the
diplomats base their opinions on the
well-established fact that during three
weeks there has been an exceedingly
active exchange of telegrams between
Tokio and Washington, .which suddenly

conclude from ' this circumstance that
the Governments' of ] the; United States

important negotiations regarding pos

"Attarian, a native of Kharput, who

Consul at Tamsui, Formosa, who is

misapprehensions concerning Manchu^

Manchuria, especially the Idahuo val
ley, is very fertile and has a dense
Chinese population. Much money, the
Consul says, is being spent between
Vladivostok and Port Arthur, in the
erection of many permanent buildings.
None of these buildings, however, is
on the East China Railway,- as has
been reported. Traffic between Port
Arthur and Vladivostok is very heavy,
calling for the operation of thirty
trains dbily.
The Consul confirms the report that
depredations have been committed by
Chinese robbers, calling for the em
ployment of Russian troops, with - a
view of suppressing the outrages.

Dr. Walter Dill Scott Says Red Lights
Are Responsible for the
Depravity of Chicago.
CHICAGO, Dec. 9.â A new scheme of
reforming Chfcago's red light district
has been suggested by Dr. Walter Dill
Scott, professor of psychology at the
Northwestern University, in an addres*
to his class. "Change the color of il
lumination in those sections," said he,
"andthere would doubtless be a change
in the morals of the community. Red
light has a peculiar effect upon thc3*
constantly in its presence.*
"Professor John Qulncy Adams citea
instances where a photographic factory
in France, illuminated with red light,
became so demoralized by the hilarity
of the workingmen and women that the
color of the light had to bs changed,
with the result that all became orderly
once more."

NEW YORK, Dec. 9. â The Mari
time Association's committee appointed
to Investigate ocean shipping, reported
progress to the association to-day and
asked for an extension of time for its
investigation.
"We; find," says the committee,
"that despite the quadrupling of for
eign commerce, American tonnage un
der register has declined from 2,496,
894 tons in 1S61 to 873,235 last year,
and. that. while American vessels car
ried 72.1 per cent of our exports In
1861 they carried only 6.6 per cent
last year." VV- .
The committee also says: "We find
that American vessels engaging in our
ocean trade are to-day compelled to
meet more serious and more destruc
tive competition than ever before,
largely through the vast subsidies and
bounties that foreign Governments are
now paying to their' merchant ships.
We realize that the purposes for which
these subsidies and bounties are paid
to their merchant ships by foreign
Governments are chiefly military â in
order that there shall be available
auxiliary cruisers, scouts, transports,
colliers, supply ships and such other
vessels, with their trained and experi
lenced officers and men, as are essen
tial to the uses of the Governments
in time of war. And we further real
ize that unprecedently low freight
rates^ resulting from these subsidies
and bounties received by foreign mer
chant ships render successful and
profitable competition on the part of
the United States vessels, built in the
United . States and officered and
manned by our own citizens, absolute
ly Impossible."
"After ; a. 'number : of ; other : professions
of ignorance Perkins was turned , over
to Guthrie'; f or, , cross-examinatibn.-
Guthrie asked two, questions about the
Sheldon syndicate and ; on Perkins-as
serting his lack of information" the wit
ness , was excused 'and > the : hearing
closed N until 'of '. next vweek,

sibillty. ; - â ,
Perkins professed ignorance on many
points, saying the negotiations
had been in the hands of Steele,. an
other of the partners.
The Harris,; Gates & Co. agreement
of August 11, 1902,, that the sale of the
Morgan and Schwab stock should 'pre
cede the sale of the rest, was men
tioned, but Perkins said that ' he ~ had
never seen' the agreement. Steele had
told him that there. was an agreement,
but he';(Perkiris) had not discussed -it
with- others/ nor had he anything to do
with Its 'Â¦ negotiation.
j.J. P. Morgan, : he. testified, kriewnoth
irig,~ to witness' knowledge, of the ship
building ' deal ' during'its . progress, and
was not . Informed of ; the negotiations
during his stay, In] Europe., . .
"But what information did you or
Morgan & Co. have of the value of the
stock you were taking in part payment
or of the value of the plants included
in the combination?" Untermyer asked.
Perkins replied that, so . far as he.
knew, "no investigation on this point
was made by Morgan & Co."
Untermyer was not.satisfled with the
word "investigation," and insisted on
an answer-in regard to "any informa
tion or knowledge of the shipbuilding
plants or their values."
Perkins insisted that he personally
had no knowledge on July 30, when the
cable was sent, of the plants, their
value or their earnings, and had no
concern with the shipbuilding transac
tion, nor did he, on August 12, when
the sale of Bethlehem was closed, have
any such knowledge to give him an
idea of the valueof the securities taken
in part payment.
Asked about Dresser, Nixon and
Pajn, . Perkins declared that he had
known them only in a general way up
to the time of the sale of the Bethlehem
plant and that he did not know that
Pam was ' representing Schwab. Dres
ser, in asking for the loan,, was speak
ing as president of the Trust Company
of the Republic, Perkins had consid
ered.' but he had not interested himself
in the question of whether that trust
company was responsible to the extend
of $2,000,000. '
McCook then askeU that the Paris
branch be informed that Schwab, Nix
on. Dresser and others were interested
in the company, that the properties
were valuable, and that the men in
terested were recommended. Perkins
consented to send a cablegram on July
30, to the purport that "Mr. Schwab
and his friends are interested in :thc'
new shipbuilding plant and would be
very glad" to have the Paris house
"take as cordial an Interest in it as is
consistent. '.,
Perkins did not recall that Colonel
McCook told him anything of the con
dition of the French underwriting or
why the recommendation was desired.
Perkins was asked what he knew of
the shipbuilding compa'hy at the time
of the sale of the Bethlehem plant, and
replied that he knew very little about
it, but the contract for. the sale pro
vided that Morgan & Co. would receive
the actual amount of cash advanced
for the Bethlehem company, the $5,000,
000 stock being taken In lieu of all
profits and interest on the investment.
Morgan & Co. were- by this contract
also to have a legal option on the or
ganization of the shipbuilding com
pany.
A copy of the Alexander letter in
closed in the Morgan, Harjes & Co. let
ter was marked for identification.
Perkins was then asked to tell in de
tail how he came to cable to Paris the
message introduced yesterday, refer
ring to the interest of "Mr. Schwab and
his friends ' in the shipbuilding com
pany. He tcld of three requests made
by Colonel McCook of /Alexander &
Green, the first asking that Morgan, &.
Co. cable to their Paris house an in
dorsement oÂ£ the shipbuilding company.
This was refused.
Guthrie characterized this statement
as "almost indecent" and the lie was
passed on both sides. Guthrie speaking
of "deliberate falsehood" on the part
of Untermyer, who retorted in terms
equally strong.
The first "question showed that this
letter inclosed a copy of a letter sent
by C. B. Alexander of Alexander &
Green to Morgan, Harjes & Co., and
over the identification and admission
of this copy another protest was made
by Counsel Guthrie for the defense.
Guthrie repeated this protest against
this letter being given to the press,
evoking a warm reply from Counsel
Untermyer, who declared that he did
not propose to submit to any more
"dyspeptic behavior" on the part of
counsel, saying Guthrie had himself
given out unintroduced testimony for
publication and making a formal
statement before the exaVniner in re
gard to Guthrie's protests about public
ity.
George W. Perkins of the firm of J.
P. Morgan & Co. resumed his testi
mony, his presence on the stand renew
ing the interest In the case. At the
opening Guthrie restored to the files In
the case the copy of the Morgan,
Harjes & Co. letter which he took
away with him yesterday, thereby pre
venting its publication, and Counsel
Untermyer resumed the examination on
this subject.
NEW YORK, Dec. 9.â A sharp, tilt
between counsel enlivened the opening
of the United States Shipbuilding Com
pany hearing to-day. Guthrie charac
terized a statement by Untermyer as
"almost. Indecent," and the latter re
torted in warm terms.

A brief in behalf of the Great North
ern Railway Company was filed by M.
D. Glover, who says that' the stock of
the Burlington Railway was acquired
in order to give the Great Northern
and the Northern Pacific access to im
portant productive centers, necessary
to place them on the proper footing
with other transcontinental lines. He
asserts that good service at low rates
is assured by the arrangements. "The
unity of ownership of their shares has
not," he said, "restrained the com
merce of either, and the extent to
which such unity can restrain it is as
nothing compared with the great in
crease in volume of interstate and in
ternational commerce which was in
tended and which will result from the
carrying out of the enterprise of the
two companies in the purchase of the
Burlington stock and the preservation
of the purchase."

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
As construed and applied by the Circuit
Court the antl-tron act Is unconstitutional
In that it discriminates between Dirsong in
the matter of property rights and privileges
on ground? that are purely arbitrary and with,
out Justification in reason.
The decree of the Circuit Court transcended
the authority of the court under the statute.
No indirect or remote effect of thtse lawful
transactions % upon competition between the
railway companies could bring them within
the Federal anti-trust law. The construction
claimed would make the statute unconstitu
tional, because it would HeprJve the securities
company of its property without due process
of law.
These transactions have "consisted merely In
the organization of a lawful corporation of
New Jersey and In the sale to and purchase
by it of property lawfully salable. All acts
done in relation to the organization of the
Northern Securities Company and to the pur
chase by It of the share* of stock of the rail
way companies and to the sale thereof by the
owners were expressly authorized by Jaw.
The legal effect of the transaction has been
that the owners of the stock In one of the
railway companies have sold the same to the
securities company and have receive'! therefor
stock of the securities company, which com
pany owns the stock not merely of cne of the
railway companies, but the stock of both. So
that each individual who has transferred his
property to the securities company has ob
tained therefor Eomerhlng entirely different,
namely, an Interest In a" company holding
stock of the other railway company as well.
It is manifest that In the fullest possible
manner this constituted a sale of tho property.
Other reasons for this position are
the following:
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.â A brief In
behalf of Messrs. J. P. Morgan, Robert
Bacon and Daniel S. Lamont, ap
pellants, with others, in the case of
the United States vs. the Northern Se
curities Company, was filed In the
United States Supreme Court to-day
by Attorneys Francis L. Stetson and
David Wilcox. They declare that the
so-called merger was entirely . lawful
and say:
try.' "
Morgan stopped . speaking at 4:03
o'clock and the Senate went into ex
ecutive session and ten minutes later
adjourned. ' '/ '
Morgan said that only yesterday he
had met a great Democrat who had
"had a place in our affairs only second
In importance to the Presidency and
had made a name for himself in diplo
macy (evidently meaning former Sec
retary of State Olney), who had bowed
his head as he said: "For the first time
in my life I have to confess that I am
ashamed of the attitude of my coun-
Morgan said that his whole purpose
was to warn the Senate against ratify
ing a treaty, the negotiation of which
he characterized as "a. most wretched,
a most abominable and a most horri
ble transaction." Notwithstanding this
was the case, the Senator continued,
"the Senate sleeps over this breach of
the Monroe doctrine, while the Presi
dent of France and the President of
the United States stand over the re
cumbent figure and intone in unison
their solemn and satisfied amen."
Mr. Morgan said that Cuba would
do well to give careful heed to our
purposes in the legislation under con
sideration. They should not forget the
old adage not to look a gift horse In
the mouth. "For in this case the gift
horse is a bronco which greets them
with a whinny and may send them
away with a kick."
Returning to the Panama situation.
Morgan said that the United States
was practically at war with Colombia,
as the result of the fact that the Presi
dent had fallen Into a trap. He want
ed, he said, to save the Senate from
this same trap. He again referred to
Bunau-Varilla, the Panama Minister,
and, after reviewing briefly that gen
tleman's history as an engineer and
contractor on the Panama canal, said
that he had "contracted wisely and
well, and had left the isthmus a^rich
man."
"He came." the Senator continued,
"as a swift winged messenger of false
hood dispatched on his mission by the
Panama Canal Company."
So far as the concession made to
Cuba in this bill is concerned, he
said, it would not be regarded by the
Cubans in anything but a serious light,
whatever the result may be.
"The Cubans will not," he said, "re
gard it as a ludicrous act in a French
vaudeville, but will accept It seri
ously." â¢
WARNING TO CUBANS.
He spoke of the negotiation of the
Panama canal treaty as a grotesque
act and declared that Panama had "no
more right to appoint a Minister to the
United States than that country had
to consecrate a saint."
Morgan took occasion to refer fre
quently to the Panama canal treaty
and in that connection again freely
criticized what he called "Presidential
usurpation." He declared that the
United States was becoming affected
to the core by covetousness, and he
said the country seemed to be quiver
ing with doubt as to whether it should
go over entirely or pursue -the better
coyjse followed by our national fore
fathers. .So far as he was concerned,
he would not be so mean as to yield
to a temptation simply to advance the
commercial interests of his State. He
asserted that the United States would
do as it might please with the island
of Cuba, and added:
"J5he is now fettered to the decks of
our warships as firmly as Professor
Langley's airship was ever attached to
his houseboat."
MORGAN' OX CAXAJj TREATY.
Teller, in resuming his speech on the
Cuban bill, took up the question of the
activity of General Wood, while acting
as Governor of Cuba, in behalf of Cu
ban reciprocity with the United States.
He said there were official records to
show that the Cuban Government had
paid to exceed $15,000 in that Interest
during General Wood's administration.
He declared that the press of both the
United States and Cuba had been util
ized in supporting the policy of reci
procity and quoted figures showing the
amounts paid for newspapers advocat
ing this policy.
In conclusion, Teller said the five
year clause could have no weight, be
cause no legislative body could bind
the act of a future body. That clause
was put in as ja. sop, Teller said.
WASHINGTON, Doc. 9.â Senator
Teller concluded his speech in oposi
tion to the Cuban reciprocity bill to
day and Senator Morgan also was
heard in opposition to that measure.
The Alabama Senator devoted the
greater share of his attention to the
Panama canal question. He charged
that the United States had broken
faith in failing to obey the Spooner
law, and warned Cuba that the same
course might be followed by us toward
that country in case the pending bill
should become a law.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.â When the
Wood investigation was resumed to
day, more than an hour was con
sumed in discussing some of the evi
dence submitted yesterday and also the
question of summoning witnesses asked
for by opponents of General Wood. .
Colonel Edgar S. Dudley, prefessor of
law and history â¢ at West Point Mili
tary Academy", who was Judge Advo
cate General in Havana during Gen
eral Wood's administration as Gover
nor-General, 1 to-day submitted a copy
of his opinion, rendered In Havana at
the 'request of General. Wood concern
ing the application of the Jal Alal
Company for a concession to operate
an amusement amphitheater. This opin
ion declared that the concession should
not'be granted, on the ground that it
would be a violation of the Foraker
amendment.
The committee decided that Colonel
Dudley would not be needed again, and
General Tasker H. Bliss was recalled.
General Bliss said, in answer to ques
tions, that he strongly opposed the ad
mission without the payment of .duty
of the silver service purchased in New
York by the Jai Alal. He received
mandatory instructions from General
Wood to admit the silver service, howr
ever, and obeyed them.
HAVANA, Dec. 9.â The House of
Representatives to-day continued the
discussion â¢ of the bill for the annul
ment of. the contracts made by General
Wood with the church authorities in
190V under which $190,000 is to be paid
annually for five years as the rental
of a number of buildings occupied by
the Government of Havana and in
other towns. The opponents of the
measure contend that the contracts
cannot be annulled. : .V '
In many States radical changes in
the water right laws will have to be
made before irrigation projects can be
undertaken under the act. Nevada al
ready hks charged her laws in con
formity with the act. It has devel
oped, continues the report, that the
States having the largest .fund are
those In which irrigation is least im
portant. A detailed report of the field
operations in progress is included in
the reoort.
Contracts have been let for three sec
tions of the work on the Truckee canal
in Nevada, and also on the Salt River
i:i Arizona. The policy has been.
..a report says, to divide the work .into
Email ucits, so as to engage a large
lumber of contractors and encourage
competition.
"The director has stated that a prac
tical application of the provisions of
the law during the one and one-half
years of its existence has shown them
effective, and that so far as can be
foreseen at the present time no further
legislation is required, the present law
having been found to be of such scope
as to accomplish its purpose of recla
mation." .
The report 6hows that while exam
inations and surveys have been made
on all sections of the arid region, Ne
vada is the only State where actual
construction has begun and Arizona
the only Territory. In other States and
Territories plans and specifications are
in various stages of progress and the
work is . being pushed. Criticism has
arisen in some quarters because the
law is not sufficiently elastic to author
ire various small projects of individual
interests and to permit a more general
distribution of funds throughout cer
tain States. What appears to be the
slow progress of the work is also stated
to bÂ» a matter of criticism.
The irrigation fund, accumulated
from the sale of . public lands in the
thirteen States and three Territories,
to which the irrigation act applies, now
amounts to a total of J16.191.636. This
fund has been accumulating in the
Treasury since 1901.
The question of drilling artesian wells
has been one of considerable moment,
in view of the fact that many persons
have importuned for such work, sim
ply, says the report, to develop the min
eral resources beneath the surface. A
ruling precluding such experiments has
been made on the ground that infor
mation possessed by the geological sur
vey on the subject does not warrant
the expenditure of the irrigation fund
for that purpose. Large areas of the
public lands have been withdrawn
from entry under the act pending fur
ther development.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 9â Secretary
Hitchcock transmitted to the House to
da;\ a report of the reclamation ser
vice, showing the work done and in
progress toward reclaiming arid lands
during "the season of 1903." The secre
tary says:
General Bliss Says Silver Set

Boring of Artesian Wells

Devotes Long Speech to Denun
ciation of American Attitude

HAVANA. Dee. 9.â The Cabinet at a
meeting to-nlsht ordered the estab
lishment of a custom-house at Nueva
Gerona, the principal port of the Isle
of Pines. The (Government thus com
plied with all requirements of the
United States residents of the Isle of
Pines, with the exception of that relat
ing to the American school. It is be
lieved that the school already estab
lished by the Americans on the island
will be given Government aid. It ia
thought that these. concessions will dis
pose of much of the opposition at
Washington to the ratification of the
reciprocity treaties. Â¦
â¢ Minister Zaldo said to-day that
United States Minister Squier3 had all
along urged compliance with the rea
sonable desires of the American resi
dents, and he added that the Cuban
Government would willingly supply
such convenience as might be found
necessary for the requirements of the
new population of the island, as it re
alized that the special conditions there
required considerate treatment.

a sack containing an assortment of hu

a bureau for $3. The furniture was sent
to her house -and it was not until yes

to look over her purchase. Upon open
ing one of the lower drawers', the sack
containing the bones came to light. The
Coroner and police were notified and
the grewsome relics were removed to

NEW YORK. Dec. 9.â By far the
most Jntercstins feature of the cur
rent sold movements has been the use
of British sovereigns as a form of re
mittance. Sovereigns are very rarely
used by gold importers owing to the
traditional dislike of London to ex
port them and to the (difficulty of se
curing coin approximately near enough
standard weight to make them profit
able. The 560.C00 of sovereigns engaged
abroad by New York bankers this week
brings the total movement to this
country of British coin up to $600,003
since November 21 last. This is gen
erally regarded as a most remarkable
movement, made possible only because
of the abnormally low level at which
the exchange market has ruled and
the very high price asked for gold bars
in London.

A woman's tongue In West Oakland
has caused no end of trouble and to
day was begun the hearing of a suit
for scandal in which Mrs. A. J. Hall is
endeavoring to recover $20,000 damages
for alleged Injury to her reputation on
account of things said about, her by
Mrs. Catherine T. Williams.
Mrs. Williams is an elderly woman
an.d accuses Mrs. Hall of leading her
niece, Gertrude Vincent, astray. She
believes that Mrs. Hall has a dominat
ing influence over her niece and has
blamed her for a world of worry- Ac
cording to the complaint in the case,
however, she has not stopped within
the bounds of decency- ' in* the things
she has told in retaliation and upon
motion of attorneys in the case Judge
Melvin ordered the case to be heard
behind c.'osed doors.
Gertrude Vincent, the storm center of
this woman's scandal, is a young wo
man 20 years of age and for the past
few years has given music lessons in
order to help support herself. She has
made her home with her aunt. Mrs.
Williams, whom she accuses, of having
abused her from childhood.
Mrs. Hall, the plaintiff In the ca3e,
lives at 1158 Fifth street, and was one
of Miss Vincent's pupils. The two be
came fast friends and when one night
Mrs. Williams came to the Hall home
and created a scene and called Mrs.
Hall names and said many uncompli
mentary things to her, Gertrude Vin
cent decided then she would never go
home again. She was given a home by
Mrs. Hall, who says on account of this
she has had visited upon her all of the
odium of the enraged* aunt.
"In a statement made this morning
she says that she was forced In self
defense to bring the action in order to
stop Mrs. .Williams from talking and
that her friends have cut her on-^he
street on account of the stories Told
about her by Mrs. Williams.
The case-will occupy several days be
hind closed doors.
Mrs. Anna Kleigel has been in the
asylum before, but. had recovered suf

permanent relapse. Arrangements
have been made to have her brought
before the courts in the morning and
have her recommitted to the Uklah
Asylum.
Complaint was made this afternoon
charging Mrs. Anna Klelgel of 1307 Pe

cousin of Mrs. Joseph B. Kleigel and

ALAMEDA.Dec. Â».â The sight *of his
mother-in-law, Mrs: Edwin J. Romer,
behind a big revolver, which she fired
at him while he was last night burst
ing in the door of her home, 720 Rail
road avenue, so affected E. W. Hesse,
an ex-oiTiccr in the German army, that
he wrote a suicidal note to the Coroner,
swallowed a bottle of chloroform and
was later trundled to jail in a. wheel
barrow for being drunk.
That Hesse's effort to terminate his
life failed is due to the fact that the
deadly drug was weak and that'there
was more whisky than chloroform in
his stomach after he had swallowed
and mixed the drinks. He was picked up
on Railroad avenue, near Eighth street,
after midnight by Policeman James Mc-
Donnell, who, finding it difficult, to han
dle his prisoner because of his limp
condition, secured a wheelbarrow and
utilized it as a horseless patrol wagon.
Hesse, who has been employed as a
steward on steamers running to the
Hawaiian Islands, married Miss Bertha
Roemer, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ed
win J. Roemer, about one year ago. A
few months previously to the wedding
his future father-in-law was arrested
and tried for tricing up his little son,
George Roemer, and lashing his naked
body eighty-five times with a knotted
rope. Hesse was then a boajrder at the
Roemer house, and during the trial,
which was sensational, appeared as a
witness for the defense. Now he says
his father-in-law and his mother-in
law have turned against him and are
the cause of him being separated from
his wife. Here is Hesse's story as he
related it in the City Prison:

Captain Hassett put the matter into
the hands of the Buffalo official*, and
while they were watching for the van
the accident occurred^
The woman came hVre and made ar
rangements with Reeves to haul her
wagon load of secreted Chinese, who,
she said, were coming from Canada a
few nights later, into his big barn.
The bargain was made at his bedside
on the night of November 22, after he
had retired.
Previous to her visit to the farm Mrs.
Simpson called upon Captain Hassett
and closed the' deal, as she supposed,
by which any word from United States
officials by mail or telegraph should be
put out of sight. She took the officer
into her confidence enough to let him
know that she was going to bring Chi

then send them West on one of the

alleging that she had "fixed" the Pull

WASHINGTON, Dec. 9â A petition
for the removal of E. T. McArthur, su
perintendent at the Npz Perce Indians
in Idaho, was filed at the Indian Bu
reau to-day by Senator Ueyburn of
Idaho. It is signed by lÂ»0 allottees
among thÂ» Nez Perces and is accom
panied by letters from G. W. Thomp
son of Leviston, Idaho. *ind A. J. Sho
valter of Lapwai, Idaho.
The petitioners charge that after an
nouncing lart summer that no rents
would be received or disbursed until
November 1. and after nearly all the
Indians had gone to the mountains.
Superintendent McArthur began receiv
ing rents and withdrew his deposits
from a national bank and placed them
in the^newly organized bank at Cul
de Sac, of which J. C. Martin, the
chief clerk of the agency, is president:
A. J. .Montgomery, assistant clerk, and,
the petitioners believe, McArthur him
self a heavy stockholder.
The petition also charges McArthur
with not attempting to suppress the
introduction of liquor on the reserva
tion; that he makes provisos in the
Indian leases that work hardships;
that he is ill tempered and threatens
to withhold rents from Indians unless
they eend their children to the Gov

Reformers Present Ten Items
Upon "Which Concessions May
lie Ajrreed Upon by Factions
NEW YORK. Dec. 9.â A joint com
mittee of' representatives of four
branches of the Presbyterian faith met
here to-day to discuss the question of
church unity, in accordance with a
resolution rassed by the General Sy
ncd cf the Reformed Presbyterian
Church at Philadelphia last year.
The delegation appointed by the Gen
eral Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church of the United States of Amer
ica consisted of Rev. Drs. William H.
Roberts cf Philadelphia, Robert F.
Coyle of Denver, moderator of the Gen
eral Assembly; Charles A. Dickie of
Philadelphia, Reuben H. Hartley of La
port e. Ind.; Douglass P. Putnam of
Princeton, Ind.. and Elders W/ M.
Fmlth of New York. Elias Perkins of
Baltimore. Edwin S. Wells of Lake
Forest. 111., and Reuben Tyler of Cin
cinnati.
The General Synod of the Reformed
Church in America was represented by
Rev. Dr? J. Preston Searle of New
Dninswick, X. J., and Rev. Dr. J. El
mendorff of New York.
From the General Assembly of the
United Presbyterian Church Â¦were pres
ent Rev. Dr. Andrew Henry of Jersey
City and Rev. Dr. J. C. Schulter of
Philadelphia.
The representatives of the General
Pynod of the Reformed Presbyterian
Ohurch in America were Rev. James
D. Steele of New York. Rev. Dr. David
Steele of Philadelphia, Rev. Dr. Thom
as Walters of Pittsburg and Rev. Dr.
David ilcKinney of Cincinnati. The
meeting organized by selecting Dr.
SearJe chairman and Dr. James D.
Steele secretary.
The subject of union was brought
before the meeting in an informal in
terchange of views, followed by the
submission of a formal proposition
from the delegates of the Reformed
Presbyterian Church embracing ten
distinct items regarding matters in
which concessions might be made by
one to another of the treating bodies.
This proposition was referred to the
executive committee with instructions
to report to-morrow.
A letter was read stating that the
body generally known as the Presby
terian Church, South, had declined the
invitation to take part in the confer
ence.

Prince, on the other hand, is an ardent
ndmirer of impressionism. The Prince
lately purchased a large number of
impressionist posters and caricatures
at a Potsdam art store, and, it is said,
rogruishly declared that part of them
were intended as a present to the Em
peror.
PACRAMKXTO. Dec. 9â William Ryan, con
victed of burglary, was this afternoon sen
tenced to five years' imprisonment at San
QuÂ«>ntin by Judpp Hart.
Four large produce commission
houses will to-day file injunction suits
fn the Superior Court against the
Board of State Harbor Commissioners
and will ask the court to restrain the
Harbor Commissioners from interfer
ing with the sale by them of perish
able produce in the city and county of
San Francisco.
The firms that will so act have ail
been deprived of their permits to sell
on the State property, this under the
provisions of the Woodward law. With
this will begin the test of the extent of
the jurisdiction and powers of the Har
bor Commissioners, as conferred by the
Woodward law. The suits will be filed
by Attorney J. B. Reinstein, who ap
pears for the commission men. No re
cent proceedings have possessed more
of interest for the whole State.
The Woodward law was enacted for
the express purpose of preventing the
formation of a fruit-selling ring or con
spiracy. The Harbor Commissioners,
when they voted last week to take
away the permits from Wolf & Sons.
L. Scatena & Co., Wetmore Brothers
and McDonpugh & Runyon, were aware
that a test of the law v.as threatened.
They held that the parties who had
lost their permits through revocation
had been given a right to permits upon
the fulfillment of certain conditions,
which compelled them to buy and sell
impartially, without regard to the af
filiations or non-affiliations of the par
ties with whom they did business. The
Commissioners believed that the condi
tions had been violated and so took
the permits away.
Scatena & Co., Wetmore Brothers,
Wolf & Sons and McDonough & Run
yon stoutly deny that they have vio
lated the law. Yesterday W. H. Wolf,
A. J. Runyon, John G. Wetmore and A.
Giannini, the latter representing Sca
tena &. Co., filed a long communication
with the Board of. Harbor Commission
ers. In that they submitted sugges
tions at^reat length for the considera
tion of the Commissioners. It amount
ed, in fact, to a circumstantial denial
of all the charges that have been made
against their firms and also contained
some reflections upon the Harbor Com
missioners' acts. It also embodied the
views of the wholesalers at large.
CASES NOT REOPENED. Â»
When this communication was pre
sented by President Spear to be read
to the board yesterday Commissioner
Kirkpatrick said that he supposed that
it amounted to a request for a rehear
ing. The four firms represented by the
signatures to the document had already
had a hearing and so far as they were
concerned the matter was closed and
their cases would not be reopened. He
asked President Spear if this was his
view of the case and Spear answered
In the affirmative. The board cour
teously listened to the reading of the
document, however.
It beg^n by setting forth that, inas
much as there was not a full board
when the four permits to sell were re
voked last week it was desired by the
signers "to submit suggestions for con
sideration."
Some of the "suggestions" amounted
to an attack upon the Commissioners.
For instance, it was said to the Com
missioners, in one place, that "natural
ly, under such circumstances we must
infer that your Judgment is clouded by
some error; that your action is due to
some passion, prejudice or ignorance,
or to some consideration of personal or
political advantage, which, of course,
should play no part in what should be
a judicial determination."
In another part of the communication
it Is asserted that "there is not now
and never has been 'any conspiracy or
agreement or understanding concerning
such prices (the prices' of perishable
products) and you know very well that
no one of such organizations nor iny
of their members, nor any combination
of their mambers, has the slightest
power to fix, modify, control or regu
late such prices."
Incidentally a threat was contained
in the long document, as follows:
"Your act (of the Harbor Commis
sioners) affects the wholesalers direct
ly, but indirectly it affects the growers
and consumers. The growers outside
of San Francisco have an association
and are members of the Wholesale
Dealers" Association, and are satisfied
with the present conditions. As to the
consumers, you may compel us to re
move from the' docks all produce of
the State that comes to San Francisco
every twenty-four hours. This will
simply mean that we must pay the en
tirely unnecessary cost of removal to
warehouses, storage charges and the
destruction in rehandllng these perish
able products. This loss we must add
to the cost to the dealer and he must
add it to the cost to the consumer."
SUGGESTS A TEST.
After the reading of the document.
Commissioner Kirkpatrick said that
the place to try the question of the
jurisdiction of the board was not be
fore the board, but in the courts. The
matter appeared to him to be directed
to the competency of the board to act
as it had acted and the validity of its
acts.
Commissioner Spear referred to some
statements made in the opening ot the
communication, in which it was in sub
stance asserted that the board had
acted in opposition to what the dealers
had Been led to expect by conversa
tion they had with him before they
took out their permits to sell on the
wharves. This inference Commissioner
Spear resented. He denied that the
committee, consisting of William H.
Wolf. Albert J. Runyon and James A.
Eveleth. who had waited on him, At
torney Davis for the Board of Harbor
Commissioners being present at the
interview, had any reason to assert
that the permits' were taken oat be
cause of any such agreement with him
concerning the interpretation of the
Woodward law. On the contrary, so
said Commissioner. Spear, he had at
the' Interview referred to taken up the
by-laws of the association of produce
commission men and had torn such
by-laws to pieces. He told the com
mittee that the law would be. enforced.
He also told them that > any man; who
was cited before the; board would have
the opportunity to withdraw his per-

with the Woodward: law as., it .was- construed
by,- the president of your â¢ board.' and your at
torney before we took out the permits.
We are satisfied ;. that upon further consid
eration you will appreciate the. certainty that
tn> Woodward law should apply , only* to thÂ«
wholesale' business done upon the. seawall and
docks within your Jurisdiction; aml-on or,be
fore March 2.- 1004.- your board will follow
the law and establish the free market. In which
market the producer, will sell at retail directly
to the ' consumer without ' the Intarventlon of
the' middleman. '- '. - Â¦ - ' -' '
ARGUES THQ CASE.
Fortunately for a'.l concerned, the holders of
your permits, and -cenerally the â¢ produce deal
ers of San (Krancirco will soon be relieved, of
the unjurt odium which has been stirred up
against them for raising the prices of vege
tables In which they da not even deal. There
are Just eighty-one .days within which your
board- must "set aoart uoon some convenient
portion of the water front of San Francisco'a
sufficient number of blocks, or parts of blocks,
belonging to: the State, contiguous to the docks
and wharves for a free market for the perish
able products of the State, of California ar
riving in San Francisco."
In this free market, pursuant to this law.
no commission rar.n"w!H be permitted to ap
pear, for you an> directed to "permit the sale
of Bi:ch Â¦ products urwn ssid blocks and por
tions of blocks of land by or for the account
of the nrodiicers thereof â¢, only." under "such
regulations as may be J prescribed by your
.board.; There should be no doubt that the "free
market will Â¦ be, established -within the tlmÂ«Â»
limited, to -wit.: March 2. 1004; because section
1 of the paid act; passed March 2, 1D03, 're
quires as follows: â¢ . .... ,
"The Board of State Harbor Commissioners
shall, within one year 1 from the passage of
this act."- set apart such -.blocks for such pur
pose..* Fortunately, also, under section 9 of this
art. there can be no question about the neces
sary funds for such free market, for.' according
to section 9. there is "hereby -appropriated out
of the San Francisco harbor Improvement fund
the ; necessary i moneys to enable the Harbor
Commission -to carry this act Into effect: and
th's appropriation shall have precedence 1 of a'l
other claims on such fund for Improvements."
: The only excuse or reason riven for your
decision, and the best one you could give, -was.
as the president ot your board said. '"to bring
this thine to' a head." The produce business
of this State done at the city of San Francisco
Is very large. The reason you give for seri
ously injuring this business is very small.
FREE MARKET BILL.
From the EtandrK)Int of law and common
sense. Justice and fair play such >a procedure
Is ridiculous and cannot be vindicated. From
ruch a procedure only an unjuÂ«t decision could
have been expected; and It followed promptly.
In declining to answer your questions aa to
our business outside of State property, we
proceeded under our Judgment that you, as
officers of this Government, should confine
yourselves to your official duties and neither
aid nor abet public or newspaper clamor,
which was without reason or right. We be
lieve that you are advised that the law re
stricts your power to State property; and wo
believe it to be both the right and the duty
of any self-respecting. citizen to refuse to an
swer you concerning matters which are none
of your official Â¦ business. We declined to an
swer your questions.- not because our answers
would Injure us. but solely because of the
ample reason that we believe you have no
right to ask. the questions.
After our examination was completed J. E.
Graves filed an affidavit which was sworn to
on December 2, 1003. five days after we were
cited to appear before yoÂ« to answer charge*.
In this affidavit Mr. Wolf. Mr. Runyon, Mr.
Wetmore and Mr. Kveleth were not even men
tioned; and this affidavit did not state one
word as to the business done on State propertv.
and made only vague general charges utterly
unworthy of consideration. You requested
him * to file this affidavit as a charge on which
to found a hearing, although the hearing had
already taken place and was finished; and he
then filed this affidavit as a charsre. after you
had taken all the testimony of all the persons
whom you cited. In other wordB. the charge
ws w.ere requested to answer was not In ex
istence until five days after we were notified
to answer it.
REASON FOR REFUSAL.
But there are numerous cases since thÂ»
adoption of the Woodward law where growers
of produce and dealers holding no permits
whatever, have sold perishable products on
State property; and we respectfully submit
that your board should restrain such sales
made in undoubted violation "of the law In
stead of revoking the permits of those who
have not violated the law in any regard.
On November 27. 1903. you sent us a writ
ten notice to appear before your board on De
cember 3. 1003. "for the purpose of Investi
gating the alleged violation of the provisions
of the law regulating the sales of perishable
products on the wharves and other State
property" In this city. On December a we
appeared. before you in answer to your cita
tion, and demanded a written statement of
cnarges. and requested only twenty-four hours
to answer the same. You did not answer our
demand because you could not; there was no
person who had filed or dared file any such
charge, because It would ' have 'been false.
You proceeded, nevertheless, to question i!Â«.
and our replies were that .we had not refused
to buy or sell produce Impartially on State
property and we denied your Jurisdiction to
Inquire into our' business outside of State
property; while Mr. Runyon denied your right
to question him at all, without a specific
charge showing wherein be had violated the
Woodward law,, â¢
On March 2. 1903. two laws were passed In
this . State, one known as the Woodward law,
to regulate the fales of perishable property at
wholesale on the seawall and docks, and one
known as the free market law, for the sale of
such products by growers only, at retail, on
some particular block or blocks to be set apart
for that purpose by the Harbor Commissioners
before March '-Â», 1904. At the meeting of our
committee with your president, early in May,
11)03, both these laws were discussed and the
understanding was reached between us that
the Woodward law was restricted In its opera
tion to sales on State property and at whole
eale and with that understanding we took out
the permits and we have never done anything
to forfeit such permit. *
TWO STATE LAWS.
If tiie state of affairs were such as to
Justify the revocation of 7 our Permits there
would be some explicit charge setting forth
the violation of the Woodward law. We have
demanded this charge and we now demand it,
but always in vain.
Your act affects the wholesalers directly,
but Indirectly ' it affects the- growers and the
consumers. Now, see. the growers outside of
San Francisco have an association and are
members of the Wholesale Dealers' Association
and are satisfied with the present conditions.
As to the consumers, you may compel Us to
remove from the docks all the produce of the
State that comes to San Francisco every twen
ty-four hours. This will simply mean that we
must pay the entirely unnecessary cost of re
moval to warehouses, storage charges and the
destruction In rehandllng these perishable pro
ducts. This loss we must add to the cost to
the dealer and he must add It to the cost to
the consumer.
We have said before that any reputable
dealer can Join any of the.su associations if
he comply with their rules. The associations
themselves must be permitted to Judge who
are reputable dealers. We are glad to submit
the rules and regulations of the flrat two as
sociations, which are the only ones of which
the holders of permits are members. Their
only regulation? are that produce shall be sold
only at wholesale on State property, and after
the hour of 7 o'clock In the morning. Any
reputable person who complies with these re
quirements is welcome to membership.
The Produce Dealers' Protective Association
alone restricts the buying and selling of po
tatoes and onions in wholesale lots to its mem
bers: but they restrict such membership only
by the requirement that the applicant be re
putable.
MEMBERSHIP RESTRICTED.
We affirm -that there Is Jto-day the freest
and iiercest competition among wholesalers and
retailern of produce in the first three associa
tions that was ever known in this city. You
will not even try to deny this statement.
any time: and they prove what we say if you
want proof.
There are nearly 1000 members o'tho Re
tail LeaUn' Association, over 100 of the Whole.
Balers' Association and about 100 of the. Pro
duce Dealers' â¢ Association. We submit to you
what sensible people will see at once, that there
cannot be a combination of so many members
scattered through so large . an area to fix
prices; And it is ridiculous to expect them to
have or to keep any agreement with reference
to the price of perishable products, the value of
which change* frcm hour to hour.
To rivet this home to you wo beg to say
that the Wholesalers' Association meets only
once a month; the Retailers' Association once
a month, and the Produce Dealers' Association
once a year.
," Ther?- Is . not now and , never has been any
conspiracy or agreement or understanding con
cerning such price*, and you know_yery well that
no one of cuch organizations nor -any of their
members. r,or any combination' of their;mem
bers, ha* .the slightest power to fix, modify,
control or rcgulatn such prices. "?Â¦Â¦+. "Â«Â¦.--
The articles -of Association ruleo.* by-law*,
agreements, etc.. of each of these associations
jou -have seen; they are at your disposal, at
The holders of permits, from your board are
all wholesalers, and all members of the first
and second associations. 'Any reputable dealer
can become a member of either association, and
there is no' reputable dealer who is not such
member. The etatus of membership In the Ue
tail Dealers' Association is exactly the same.
The Colombo Market limits . Us j members â¢ to
growers only. -
' There Is not one word in the rules . or regu
lations. . bylaws or papers of, any of Â¦ the first
three associations which mentions prices or
fixes or concerns itself with or alters cr modi
fies or controls, directly or indirectly, the prices
of any article bought or sold by .any of its
members. There, la no written â¢ or verbal , or
secret understanding, directly or Indirectly. In
reference f.o the cost or, price of Â¦ any -article
bought or sold by any member* of these "asso
ciations. - . ,
HOLDERS OF PERMITS.
And first to relieve the problem of the ran
cor from the charge that we have raised the
price of small vegetables and garden truck,
we beg to state one simple, single fact,
which of course you know: ihat none of the
holders of permits deal in such vegetables.
You know, of course, that we are wholesalers
and have nothing to d<5 with the retailing of
such vegetables, and do not deal in so called
garden truck or small vegetables in any way
whatever; and ir we need them we must buy
of the Colombo Market at their prices.
You know that the Colombo Market, which
Is an organization solely of growers handles
practically,; all of what is called garden .truck
or small veRe4ab>es. at least 05 per cent of.it.
and that no dealer is or can be 'member of
this market ond that the members of the
Colombo Market fix the prices of their prod
ucts each Saturday for the ensuing week. In
other words, the only combination to fix
prices and which does fix prices. Is tÂ»>zt of
the vegetable growers themselves: and you
know that we have no more to do with these
prices than the man in the moon. r Â¦
Veverthele.V . broadcast newspaper statements
have been rot*-? recently that there is a corrupt
and trapping a*s<viaticn ot which we are mem
bers which Â«Inc-esJ5*s the price of produce to
consumers in this city. This Is pimply and
unqualifiedly falfe. and In the. performance of
your duties as Harbor Commissioners It seems
to us impossible that you should not know it.
There are four associations â¢ whose members
deal In produce: First, the. Wholesale^ Fruit
and Produce Merchants' Protective Association;
E-cond, the Produce Dealers 1 Protective Asso
ciation: third, the Retail Fruit and Vegetable
Dealers' Association, and fourth, the Colombo
Market Association. . "'_*-â
Therefore we also requested in writing the
opportunity to present all the facts before
your board, and as you denied us that un
doubted right, we beg to present at least
some of the most important ones bearing on
the question. *"
PRICE OF VEGETABLES.
It is easy to raise a public clamor against
a dealer In food products whenever the price
of such products is high; and when a news
paper Inflames the public -opinion sufficiently
there is little use in trying to tell thÂ» public
facts which show that there Is not the slight
est reason for complaint: and sometimes of
ficials charged with public duties consider it
wise to make their decisions suit this public
clamor. . r,

Naturally, under such circumstances we
must Infer that your Judgment is clouded bv
Borne error; that your action is due to some
passion, prejudice or ignorance, or to some
consideration of personal or political advan
tage, which, of course, should play no part in
what should be a Judicial determination
Now. this cause of your error Is neither
hard to find nor far to seek. For several
months past one of the newspapers of this
city has devoted much of its time trying to
thow that we and othÂ»r produce dealers were
members of a' combination which had In
creased the price of vegetables in San Fran

JURISDICTION OF BOARD.
To tl^e noard of State Harbor Commissioner*
of California â Dear Sirs: Inasmuch as there
was not a full board present on December 3.
1JHX!, when ycu revoked our permits under the
Woodward law, ' we desire to submit the fol
lowing suggestions for your consideration:
On April 30. 1!W3. your board eent written
notices to us and others who are all wholesalers
requesting that v.e take cut permits under the
Woodward law. whereupon a committee of the
Wholesale Fruit and Produce Merchants, com
posed of William II. Wolf. Albert J. Runyon,
Jam'-s A. Eveleth. with their attorney, inter
viewed President Spear at his written request
In his office, Mr. Davis, the attorney, of your
board, being present.
This committee Etated that they did not de
sire to take out permits under this law, which
they were advised was not only unconstitu
tional, but so impracticable and ambiguous
that no one could tell what construction might
be placed upon the phrases In the law to the
effect that we should not "refuse to sell any
solvent purchaser, or buy from any person
whatever," and that we would 6ell "Impar
tially and nt the same prices to all who de
elre to purchase for cash."
We explained that we were wholesalers and
exhibited to you our rule* that we could not
sell to any one on the seawall or docks less
than fifty backs of potatoes or twenty-five sacks
of onions at one time; that we considered it
utterly impracticable to sell at such places- at
retail to any consumer who might want only a
pound of any article In which we deal. You
agreed that this v.as a reasonable construc
tion of the law. and that bo long aa we abided
by It we would not be deemed to have violated
the permit; and you promised to pass rules and
regulations In conformity with those of our as
sociation. With that understanding, and only
upon that understanding, and relying upon It,
we took out the permits, j â¢
1 mit. He resented the insinuations in
the communication.
Before the meeting of the board end
ed action was decisively taken in two
matters. L. G. Sresovich & Co., Gar
cia & Magginl, Mitchell* & Goodall and
G. Kerti & Co. were notified to appear
next Tuesday morning at 10:30 o'clock
to be heard relative to the revocation
of their permits to sell, it having been
set up in an affidavit that they" had
refused to sell to a retailer who was
not a member of the retailers' asso
ciation. To put the board more defi
nitely on record, so that- every one
might understand its purpose fully,
the following, prepared by Attorney
Davis for the board, was, on motion of
Commissioner Kirkpatrick, adopted:
"Whereas. This board desires to lend all aid
possible to carry into effect the provisions of
the act Known as the Woodward act. now
therefore be It
Resolved. That the rules and regulations for
the port of San Francisco adopted by the
Board of State Harbor Commissioners be
amended by adding a new section thereto to
be numbered 45 which section shall read aa
foilov.-s:
No person, firm or corporation shall bs per
mitted to sell any fruit, vegetables, poultry,
*8Ss. honey or other produce commonly known
aa perishable products over and upon any of
the public wharves or other property belong
ing to the State in the city and county of San
Francisco, within the jurisdiction of the Board
of Harbor Commissioners, who Is or who may
become a party to any conspiracy or agreement
or understdndir.gr whereby such person, firm
or corporation shall refuse to sell to any solv
ent purchaser or buy from any person, what
ever within this State: or who does not eell
Impartially and at the same price to all with
in the State who desire to purchase for cash.
without regard to their business or intended
disposition of the products, or who exercise
any discrimination whatever, between buyers
and sellers by reason of their occupation, af
filiations or non-affiliations.
An application for a permit was re
ceived from A. Bruman, 221 Front
street, but no action was taken. The
communication of the representatives
of,the four commission firms that^have
loit their permits through revocation
by the Harbor Commissioners is, in
full, as follows: Â¦>

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. 9.â
The last general assembly of the pres
ent semester was held in assembly hall
this morning and Captain Charles
Young of the Ninth United States
Cavalry, one of the very few negroes
who have graduated from West Point,
was the principal speaker.
President Jordan delivered a few re
marks in regard to the . diphtheria
scare, in" which he commended the
work of 'Health Officer W. F. Snow ; and
the Students'. Guild, and- assured the
students that all danger of a diphthe
ria epidemic was over, and that there
had not been a single case of. secondary
infection, hence the use of the word
"epidemic" in connection with the sit
uation.was improper. - . .-
Professor C. Searles o* the Romanic
languages department- addressed the
students on the subject of the support
of student activities, . and condemned
in strong language | the "deadheads"
who occupy the windows of Encinal
Hall during football games and other
athletic, meets instead of paying the
regular admission to the athletic field
and thus aid in defraying the expense
of carrying on college athletics.
Captain Young, the principal speak
er, made a plea to the students on be
half of the colored people of this coun
try. The welcome given the speaker
by the students showed very plainly
that they do not draw the color line in
judging a man. Captain Young aald
in .part: * "The theory of applying in
dustrialism to the negroes as practiced
by Booker Washington at Tuskegee is
all right, but when a black man Is
thus thoroughly trained Industrially
and goes out into the world looking for
work he ( runs up against a union and
is told that he need not apply.' People
who employ black men are often an
noyed by, their Â¦: neighbors. We have
been urged as a people to give up our
ideas of higher education, and yet you
know that Tuskegee and such institu
tions could not exist if men. trained in
higher education, men with high ideals,
were not .at the heads of such institu
tions. Even though . we have Â¦ great

PRESIDENT JORDAN SAYS
DIPHTHERIA SC/\RE IS OVER
Professor E. S: Twight addressed the
delegates on "Improvements in the
Bench Grafting of Resistant Stock."
D. D. Allison followed with an inter
esting talk on "The Handling and Mar
keting of the Raisin Crop." :
The last speech of the evening was
made by A. T: J. Reynolds, who spoke
of "The Growers' Co-operative
Agency." . .
A general discussion closed the day's
work. ,- -i.-
"The question of pest on your vines
and Irult trees is one receiving full
attention from the government of this
State. We believe that anything that
will militate against your efforts is
doing an injury to this State, which
State should do everything to work
against.
"Therefore, I wish to assure you
that the government is alive to the dif
ficulties of the situation you are facing,
and is willing, aye, is glad, and wel
comes the opportunity to do whatever
lies in its power to forward your busi
ness and make your ventures more
profitable."
There was a burst of applause when
the. Governor concluded, and Russ
Stephens and Senator Johnson of
Sacramento, respectively, moved' and
seconded a vote of thanks to the
State's - executive, which was carried
with enthusiasm. ;
Senator Rowell followed and spoke as
an observer of things connected , with
the raisin industry in this country and
Europe. . .
Percy D. Morgan read an interesting
paper on the prospects of the wine in
dustry.
â¢At the close of the afternoon session
Governor Pardee held an informal re
ception on the platform: ..
At the evening session raisin and
wine grapes again formed the general
subject of papers and discussion. Rob
ert Boot, president of the California
Raisin Growers' Association, spoke on
"The Raisin Grape."
"The chairman of this meeting and
horticultural officer of this State have
been good enough at various times to
come into my office * and endeavor to
discuss with me matters which are of
the greatest importance to you, and
therefore to the State. I say 'endeavor'
because the discussion is altogether
one-sided, I knowing little or nothing
of the matter and he being a past mas
ter, but I find there are various prob
lems which should receive and will re
ceive the due attention from the people
of the State and the government of thfa
State, as their magnitude deserves.
"The â¢ question of transportation
seems to me of the utmost importance.
We have two great railway systems,
both utterly unable to take care of
the business California offers them.
Instead of taking your products
quickly to the markets of the world,
it takes time which practically takes
from them a value which' should be
yours. . -I- Â¦
The programme contained the assur
ance of helpful papers and the promise
was not disappointed, for the addresses
of Professor Newton B. Pierce of Santa
Ana on the California vine disease,
which Is distinct from phylloxera; that
of T. C. White on the raisin outlook,
i and especially that of Percy T. Morgan,
] president of the California Wine Asso
ciation, were valuable contributions of
great Importance.
Governor Pardee appeared at the aft
ernoon session and his address was the
i feature of the day. He reviewed the
j history of the State during its pioneer
j and gold mining days and spoke of the
I wonderful changes that have taken
J place. He spoke of the part fruit grow
lers have taken in the development of
} the State and the great reward that
! is ours. He concluded as follows:'
FRESNO, Dec. 9.â The feature of the
day's proceedings of the Fruit Grow
ers' Associations convention was the
presence and address of Governor Par
dee. President Cooper took occasion to
mention that the fruit growers in twen
ty-nine conventions, had been honored
only three times by the presence of the
State's executive, and, as was also
pointed out by the chairman, it seemed
particularly appropriate that the Gov
ernor should be there this lime, in view
of the unanimity with which the fruit
growers appear to have agreed that
the problems of to-day are greater
and â¢ more momentous than any that
have hertofore confronted them. To
day was raisin day and was devoted
almost exclusively to the problems
which ar; looming large before' :the
people in parts of the State wheje the
grape is raised. " â¢
SAN DIEGO, Dec. 9â As a result of
thecoriviction of Florencia Jailles and
hie sentence on June 26 last to twenty
five years In prison on a charge of at
tacking an ' Indian giri, an investiga
tion is' to. be made of the .court pro
ceeding-sat the request of the Mexican
Government. The Mexican Consul in
this; city, 'Senor Lemeli. reported the
case to his, Government and as a result
the request; for an investigation comes
from the highest Mexican authority,
Senor Manuel do Aspiroz, Embassador
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of
the republic, of Mexico, who addressed
the matter to Secretary of State Hay,
inclosing the copy of the report of
the local Consul, Senor Lomeli, to his
Government. ' Secretary Hay trans
mitted the whole to Governor Pardee
of .this State, from him it was passed
over to the State's Attorney General
and has now found its way tp the of
fice of the District Attorney of this
county.' ,'i . . :
In making his report to ttie Mexican
Government the local Consul took oc
casion to draw a : parallel v between the
case of Jailles; who received a twenty
five-year sentence, and thfit;of H. E.
Proctor, an American, who was held
for an attempted attack on a little girl
at Imperial 'and through an unfor
tunate technicality of law escaped
punishment. In pointing these cases
out the local Consul directly insinuates
that this Avas a discrimination of jus
tice against the citizen of Mexico.
Embassador Aspiroz's letter to Sec
retary Hay states that the guilt of
Jailles appears not to be fully estab
lished and that no such severity has
been exhibited in the same country
and court to puni3h a like offense as
in the case of Jailles.
The Proctor case referred to result
ed in Proctor's release through a tech
nicality, the time limit for trial ter
minating while his attorneys were try
ing to free him in the preliminaries.
While; prospecting ' last September
Craigie ..came .near starving to death
while searching for. Bull. Bull left
camp expecting to return the same
night. After - waiting three days
Craigie' started out to flnd^him, and
for three, days he had only one small
whistler to eat.' Reaching camp nearly
starved he found Bull in the midst of
plenty. Bull had killed a number of
caribou and took time to build a raft
for transporting them before returning.

Craigie, explorer/ hunter and, trapper,
has arrived at Dawson from the Mac
kenzie Rivtr with a caravan of Peel
River- Indians. Craijgie led the Indi
ans through a ne\vly discovered pass
In the Rocky Mountains which brings
the Mackenzie River three hundred
miles nearer Dawsbn. The old trails
via Porcupine River swung around to
Dawson in a huare ssmiclrcle. The new
trail goes in an almost straight line. Â¦
Craigie reached Dawson from, the
new pass, which he named Seela, .in
four rfays. He was the first white
man to cross it and the Indians were
Ignorant of its existence. Craigie is a
partner of George Bull, another Mac
.kenzie River trapper. Four years ago
while Bull was hunting in Twelve Mile
district he looked for a new pass into
the Mackenzie ..River, country, reaching
conclusion that an pass could be
found in th(j vicinity of ' .what is now
known as: Peela pass.. He told Craigie
of his belief," csLusing/Craigle to exam
ine the rarigepn the Mackenzie; River
side and resulting in the discovery now
made! " Last /summer Craigie and Bull

utaries. In the Mackenzie River coun

SAN JOSE, Dec. 9. â An unknown
man was found in an unconscious con
dition In the Manila Hotel this
morning. Nothing was found in ths
room to lead to his Identity. He is about
40 or 45 years of age aDd either a Ger
man or a Russian. A couple of dol
lars in silver and a checkbook showing
that a check for $45 had been drawn
by J. C. Staats in favor of himself was
found. . Staats is probably the man's
name. He had been rooming at the
hotel for two weeks and had been liv
ing on canned goods. His condition is
believed to be due to excessive drink.
Found Unconscious in His Itoom.
At Milton the men were met by depu
ties and given supper and hotel accom
modations at the company's expense.
During the night the men were awak
ened and instructed to noiselessly fol
low one of the deputies, who was armed
with a rifle. After proceeding a quar
ter of a mile In the direction of the
mine, ten miles distant, half a hundred
strikers, armed with clubs, suddenly
made their appearance. The escort of
the laborers had his rifle behind him
and made no attempt to U3e it, and the
men themselves made no resistance to
the order of the strikers to leave the
vicinity.
i Thre are 150 strikers in Milton and
the town i3 greatly excited and trouble
is expected.
STOCKTON, Dec. 9.â Armed with
dubs, a mob of about fifty, strikers
from the ftoyal mine at Hodson held
up a crowd of would-be miners under
armed escort early this morning near
Milton, marched them down the track
about a mile and ordered them out of
the vicinity. The order, backed by
brandishing chjbs and forcible lan
guage,, was obeyed in haste.
Such was the story brought to Stock
ton to-day by one of the men who had
a thrilling part in what for a time
looked as though it would terminate in
a tragedy. The man, who had walked
from Milton this morning, stated that
he was one of the forty men who came
from San Francisco on the boats yes
terday morning, having been promised
work in the Royal mine at Hodson by
a San Francisco employment agency.

Admiration is a type of beauty essentially modern. The strong-
est element of modernity of this study, however, is to be found in its
composition. There arc styles in women as well as in everything
el?e. The type preferred to-day ha? not the same element of beautv
which our forefathers most admired, or perhaps that will be admired
by tne coming generation. Almost every year brings a new type of
the "Summer Girl" or the "Golf Girl," etc. The clothes, manner and
mode of dressing the hair contribute much to the creation of an im-
pression that there is an actual change constantly taking place in
the form and features of the fair portion of the human race. It is
possible that new thoughts, ideas and conditions have an influence
upon the form of the body and features and perhaps the color of the
bair and eyes may be affected.
The type portrayed with so n:uch grace and distinction bv Bry-
5on has the characteristic of up-to-date famininity. The-<efined type
of beauty in the figure, the grace of movement suggested in her pose
and the mingled expression of intelligence anj sweetness in her fea-
tures, combined criiii the artislic arrangement of accessories, the
da?h of color and the delicate flesh *ints. make this a"most>beautiful

The strike of. the butchers in the

Archbishop J. J. Harty of St. Louis,
recently consecrated at Rome and del
egated to the diocese of Manila, ar
rived in this city yesterday, accompa
nied by his secretary, Mgr. Fowler, for
merly of Sioux City, arid Is registered
at the Palace. The distinguished
Catholic prelate will leave for his new
see on the steamer China,. which sails
next Saturday, a fact which was cabled
to Bishop Guidi, the apostblic repre
sentative In the Philippines, Â«yesterday.
Archbishop Harty received his ap
pointment i.o Manila on June 6, it being
one of the last official acts of the 'ate
Pope Leo XIII. He was later called to
Rome and on August 15 he was duly 1
consecrated by Cardinal Satolli, acting
under the direction of Pope Pius, the
ceremony being participated in by the
members of the American colony and
the students of the American College
of Rome. As a memento of the solemn
occasion, the new Archbishop to-day
proudly carries with him a golden
cross of beautiful workmanship, pre
sented tb him by Pope Plus, who se
lected it from the relics of â¢ the late
Pope Leo, It being a present to the
latter at one of his Jubilees.
Regnrding his future work in â¢ lite
Philippines. Archbishop Harty said
last night that he had not as yet de
cided on anything definite.
PRELATE'S FUTURE PLANS.
"I have no plans," remarked he. "ex
cept that it is my intention to imme
diately take up the work as I find it
when I reach Manila. The Holy See
has already outlined the work of the
church in the Philippines. We are ex
pected to act along educational lines,
and it Is especially. to the improvement
of the schools and the colleges that we
are expected to give our greatest at
tention. Before his death Pope Leo ap
pointed Bishops to all the dioceses of
the islands. As to my own position in
the city of Manila, while it does not in
any way Interfere with the work of
the outside Bishops, it is, in a way, one
to which certain matters may be re
ferred. All the Bishops of the Philip
pines are. like myself, Americans. The
request was made to the Holy See by
this Government to appoint only Amer
ican Bishops and to this request the
Pope gave his full approval, for he
clearly appreciated the need of teach
ing the natives of the Islands to be
loyal to this country and its tlag.
Throughout \hfe war with Spain the
Catholic church of this country, as Is
well known, maintained its loyalty to
the highest degree to the United States
and it is endeavoring to inculcate the
same feeling in the new subjects In that
far-off possession."
PROUD OP HIS PAST WORK.
While Archbishop Harty leaves for
hia new see with the fondest of antici
pations, he nevertheless leaves behind
him some "regrets for the happy sphere
that he has been compelled to abandon.
He was born in St. Louis fifty-one
years ago and received his spiritual
education there, being a graduate of
the St. Lauls University and the St.
Vincent Theological Seminary.
"Twenty-five years ago," said he last
evening, "I was ordained a priest, and
for fifteen years I .presided over the
destinies of St. Leo's parish, which I
founded, and in.which I built a church,
a residence and a Â¦ school building,
which aggregate in', value something
like $250,000. I have patiently watched
my parish grow and naturally I feel
proud of the success that: I have
achieved In my clerical capacity. I
have left behind me a parish of loyal
people, who reposed in me their fullest
confidence and never missed an oppor
tunity to demonstrate the fact. It is
therefore but natural that I should
show some regret In bidding thesegood
people farewell, and the greatest con
solation I find is In the hope -that I
will accomplish as much good In my
new sphere."
Before leaving St. Louis- Archbishop
Harty turned over to his parishioners
his personal . property, amounting to
about $14,000, retaining only, sufficient
money to carry him through, to the
Philippines. He felt that he was about
to begin life anew, and wanted to start
afresh as he had done years. ago, wrieh
he undertook the building up of "St.
Leo's parish in St. Louis. The Arch
bishop's journey westward was by way
of Los Angeles, where he has a number
of friends, and where he received quite
an ovation on his arrival ; there last
week. Yesterday, shortly after, his ar
rival in this clty.-he and his secretary
paid their respects^o Archbishop, Rlor-^
dan and Archbishop Montgomery.' To
day he and his secretary will visit the
Catholic Theological Seminary at Men
lo Park.' ' i' A '.'Â¦'' ' . v*-

Eight restaurants that had closed
under orders from the Restaurant

rants. They are conducted by Ruedl
ger, Loesch & Co., Ill Larkin street;

All the other eating-houses, number-
Ing, about thirty-five > in all, remain
closed. The Restaurant Keepers' As
sociation is determined to win and' In
tends to stand firm. On the other hand
the Cooks' ' and Waiters' unions : be
lieve they will be victorious. Officers
of both unions say that the men and
women who have lost their places by
reason of the closing of certain res
taurants have secured employment
elsewhere. , , ..
Peter Peterson, a restaurant keeper ,
at 621 Kearny > street, has posted a
sign on his window Informing the pub
lic that he will reopen for business to
day. Shortly afterward the sign was
read by a walking delegate of the
Walters' Union and the latter entered
and tried to get Peterson to sign the
agreement. ' Peterson refused Â¦ and the
walking delegate ordered a union man j
to. walk out of the place. Peterson
gave up the plan. and tore down his
sign. He will remain closed.
Both sides are holding, meetings
dally. Each Is waiting for the other to j
make overtures and neither will start
the . ball . rolling toward a settlement.
M. Johnson, chairman of the executive
committee of the Restaurant Keepers'
Association, said last evening that it
was up to the unions to move. He
said the association had closed many!
restaurants and would not settle untli 1
certain clauses In the new agreement
were either stricken out or amended.
He reiterates that the unions have no
right to Ignore the association or try to
compel individual members to sign the
agreement. Mr.. Johnson is sanguine
of victory and actually claims one.
There is a rumor that both sides will
come together to-morrow for : confer
ence. ; : ' *
Gooch's oyster-house, on Ellis street,
near Powell, will close at 6 o'clock. this
morning in sympathy with the asso

The local joint executive board of
the unions involved in the difficulty Is
sued the following statement last
night: / . ,
Â¦ ''There has appeared in the dally
press as coming from Mr. Johnson,
chairman of the Restaurant Keepers'
Association, a statement to the effect
that they had notified the. ; Cooks' and
Walters' 'Union of a desire to meet with
their representatives.
"If any communications to that effect
have been sent to either the Cooks'
Union, the Waiters' Union or to the
undersigned executive board. ' such
communications have not reached the
above mentioned bodies.
"To the contrary, when the Restaur
ant Keepers' Association sent an ulti
matum to the unions that unless the
employes of the Central Restaurant, on
Ellis street, were ordered back by 10
a. m.. Saturday they would close their
places of business, the unions appointed
a committee to go before the Restaur
ant Keepers' Association,' which was
to assemble that same afternoon.
"Our request for a conference with
the Restaurant Keepers' Association
was refused by Mr. Johnson, chairman
of the executive committee.
"The unions are and always have
been ready and willing to meet the em
ployers." Â¦ . Â¦ ; Â¦ )' .
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.â Republican
national committeemen are arriving
in Washington for the quadrennial
meeting, which will open on Friday in
the Arlington Hotel. With this van
guard of the men who decide the date
and location of the next national con
vention come the convention boomers.
Some of them are already on the
gTound, comfortably located in head
quarters, and prepared, through the
proper committees, to talk eloquently
in favor of their respective cities. .
The question of representation In the
next convention, as expressed in circu
lar letters sent out by General Brayton
of Rhode Island, is a topic of no little
interest to the committeemen. Most of
the committeemen who have arrived
agree that they have no authority to
say what the basis of representation
shall be in the call to be Issued for the
convention. The most â¢ the committee
ca'n do, they say, is to pass a resolu
tion recommending that a basis w'hich
will reduce the number of delegates
from the South be adopted.
This view of the situation in part is
sharrd by Postmaster . General
Payne. member of the commit
tee from Wisconsin, and vice
chairman both of the national com
mittee and of the executive committee.
Payne is the father of the Idea for re
duced representation and urged It
stoutly In the Philadelphia convention.
â¢"I still favor my plan and believe it
ought to be adopted," said Payne to
night, "but I am aware that It Is a
matter which the convention must pass
upon. The committee may discuss It at
the approaching meeting If Mr. Hanna
chooses to rule it in order, but the
committee, as I understand it, cannot
take any decisive action."
The talk about the date for the con
vention seems to favor the Tuesday
nearest the middle of June. The senti
ment in favor of Chicago as the conven
tion city Increases, so that among the
delegates now here it is regarded as a
foregone conclusion that that city will
be selected.
not be easily overestimated. The United
States in entering upon its task in the
Philippine Islands enjoyed the very
great advantage of Spain's preliminary
work.
"Through Spanish influence and
precept the Filipinos have attained a
noteworthy ..distinction among the
peoples of the Far East for their good
manners and generally dignified bear
ing. As instructors and models- In
thlsdepartment Ihe Americans would
have been greatly Inferior to the Span
iards; for the American's manners do
not constitute a conspicuous claim to
distinction. He goes to t"he islands
as the representative of a superior civ
ilization, but his personal superiority
docs not appear In his manners. In
this respect the Filipino outranks
him. The American, however, jus
tifies his presence as a leader and a
teacher in the Islands by the fact that
his mission begins where the mission
of the Spaniard ended. The Spaniards
taught the Filipinos the forms of en
lightened society; the Americans are
expected to give them an opportunity
to acquire its open-minded, liberal
and humane spirit." Â¦ Â¦'."
SELF-GOVERXMENT.
After speaking of the civil govern
mental offices created in the Philippine
Islands, Professor Moses continued:
"In the municipalities or townships
the first steps were taken toward the
establishment of local self-government.
The president, vice president and the
members of the Municipal Council are
elected. But In view of the limited
knowledge and experience of the bulk
of the inhabitants, it was found to be
expedient to confine the privilege of
voting in the beginning to. a compara
tively few persons. It was confined to
those who had held some of the princi
pal municipal offices prior to the Amer
ican occupation, those who had prop
erty valued at 500 pesos, or who had
paid taxes to the amount of 30 pesos,
and those who could read, write and
speak English or Spanish.
"By granting this privilege to the lim
ited number of persons who had thfe
qualifications required an opportunity
was given to the people to acquire the
first elements of the knowledge neces
sary to enable them to govern them
selves. This provision was in marked
contrast with the law established in
Porto Rico and Hawaii, which con
ferred the highest privileges of citi
zenship alike upon the fit and the unfit
An important branch of the govern
mental organization is that which em
braces the system of public istruction.
DOUBTER AND CRITIC.
"At this point the doubter and the
critic apaear and wish to know the
reason and the ground of the author
ity which one* nation exercises over a
part or.the whole of an alien people,
as when the United States assumed to
Bet up a government in the Philippines.
Sometimes a reference to the political
tendency of the age suggests a reply;
and of the tendencies of this age none
is more conspicuous than the rise of
a few great nations to dominate the
world- In political as well as in ecd-'
nomical affair's the tendency is to de
velop larger effective units for control.
"One of thf- consequences of this *.ari
dency- is the hope which It brings of
permanent peace and order. -When the
small nations shall have become either
absorbed or relegated to positions of
virtual dependence, only the great na
tions amone themselves will be able
to disturb the peace of the world. But
these great nations will find*- peace,
with a mutual" understanding as to the
method of settling difficulties,- more ad
vantageous tb^an war, for. among the"
great nations of fifty years hence war
to ( a finish or, to the point of.subjuga
tion will be an impossibility.". .

Professor Bernard Moses, one of the
commissioners who represented the
United States Government in the Phil
ippines, and now of the University of
California, delivered a most interesting
address last night before the Channing
Auxiliary and friends at the First Uni
tarian Church. Every seat in the edi
fice was occupied long before Mrs. C.
E. Grunsky introduced the lecturer.
The : subject chosen by Professor
Moses was "The Old and the New
Regime In the Philippines." He began
with an illustration of the character of
Spain's policy with reference . to the
Philippines and to her colonies gener
ally.
Professor Moses said in part:
â¢Now that Spain has fallen from the
relatively high position which she once
occupies and her colonies have either
become Independent states of been
brought under the authority of other
nations, it Is almost inevitable that her
achievements should be* underesti
mated; for failure In politics and war
leads the world generally to think
Â¦lightly of all the t/ther products of a
nation's activity.
SPAIN'S ACHIEVEMENTS.
"The political and military decline of
Spain are likely to give rise to new
and lower estimates of Spain's achieve
ments in behalf of civilization, and it
is quite possible that these estimates
will be erroneous; that Spain in her
weakness will not receive just credit
for her great achievements in the days
of her power.
"It has, in fact, become fashionable
to speak lightly of Spain's work in ex
ploring and colonizing America and the
islands of the Pacific. But this flippant
Judgment, uttered a thousand times
daily, is not the final word respecting
Spain's contribution to civilization,
whether it is rendered in reference to
the .affairs of the peninsula or of the
colonies. The American has always
found it difficult to appreciate the
achievements of the Spaniards, partly
because of political rivalry and partly
b?cause of the wide divergence of their
aims and the unlikeness of their na
tional points of view. The Spaniard is
conservative, while the American is
radical. The Spaniard is polite, and
attaches grreat importance to forms of
speech and ceremonies in social inter
course. The American is unconven
tional in speech, and regards the cere
monious politeness of the Spaniard as
the manifestation of a certain human
weakness. The Spaniard is skillful in
formulating: rules and methods. The
Am^riccn is prompt fn action.
â¢"In estimating the results of Spain's
influence in the Philippine Islands we
have to take into consideration not
only the persistently benevolent inten
tions of the King, but also the uncon-:
trolled malevolence of subordinate of*
fleers and irresponsible private per
sons. The King might design the well
being of the islanders, but if his agents
had other designs, he was powerless to
carry out his intentions; for it must
be remembered that during the greater
part of the Spanish colonial period the
Crown had only the roost infrequent
and often indirect communication with
the Philippines.
GAIN PRACTICAL. IDEAS.
The Filipinos under Spanish influence
became formally Christians and the
church, in the course of the centuries
It has dominated them, has impressed
upon their minds a large number of
practical ideas. Through the influence
of these ideas the Filipinos have, to a
certain extent, been turned away from
the Oriental point of view and made
to see things as Spaniards see them.
â¢They have been brought with respect
to -many particulars to Â¦ 'occupy > the
Spaniard's point of. view, .
-. "As the Spaniard, through long con
tact with the Moors .and thelnfusion
of a certain amount" of Jewish : and
Moorish blood, has become something
of an Oriental, so the Filipino, through
long contact with the Spaniard and. the
infusion of a certain amount of Euro
pean blood, has become something of a
European.

WOOD, under life sentence at Folsom,
I combined and ...conspired with other desperate
N-^ prisoners to escape. "Their plans necessarily .in
volved murder of guards and officers;' since they were
to be carried out in daylight, and when'" tlic lawful
authorities were on duty.' They seized .the; Warden and
other officers. They^ committed murder .in-rcxeciiting
their felonious purpose. They were guilty' of" murder
again during their flight, and were armed and prepared'
to do murder from the moment of their flight to their
capture. They were all accessory â¢ to every murder that
was committed. They were, in law, all principals* in the
commission of that capital crime. ; ;
Wood, who seems to have* been the ringleader in
the series - capital crimes, was tried v for murder in
Sacramento by a jury, which has-found him guilty of
murder in the-second degree! ! This is equivalent to an
acquittal, since the punishment of .second degree mur
der is imprisonment, and V'.hc is* already" under -life
sentence,, so that 'ho penalty attaches, ttnderfthe verdict..
It is said that four determined jurors out of the Â¦twelve
bent the other eight to their wilTand secured a verdict
for a crinie^'which admits of no penalty. It is -difficult
to exercise patience with such a perversion of justice.

A Hero Unsung.
San Franciscans are well aware of the presence^ of
that obnoxious class of individuals. whose conceit allows
them to stand 1 on .the corners and ogle ladies a* they
pass. All too familiar .'are those men in flashy garb,
who believe that their very presence will so dazzle the
eyes* of femininity that they need but to display it to
good advantage to have women gladly accept their com
pany. 7,They are. those whose life is lived on the streets
and who,^therefore, are Avbnt to believe that the public
highway "-.is. the best theater for the -practice of their
wooing powers. - . . , ...â¢;..Â¦ * . Â¦
--The* nmSancc is great, but it lies with the ladies them
selves to cure the evil. " A mere scornful glance at J one
of these insulters profits V nothing -and only v provokes a
sally, of" bantering when the "masher" returns to the
corner from, which he sallied forth and* mingles again
,witlvhis kind. A remedy for the nuisance is provided by
the courts, and. ; one who has been offended by these
vulgar attentions has.only to report the matter to the
nearest to bring the" fellow to the punishment
which' is .decreed by law. .If ladies who are insulted by
these sidewalk gallants would, resolutely put their = pride
in their pockets and secure the co-operation of -the
police the nuisance would "be rapidly abated. It, is an

the city. Wei cannot' expect ladies from the country to

MASHERS ON THE STREETS.
Arthur Msy Knapp, owner and pub
lisher of the Japan Daily Advertiser of
Yokohama, believes that Japan could
teach Russia a lesson in fisticuffs if
the opportunity which has been hover
ing over the horizon 3hould finally ar
rive. To a New Tork interviewer he
recently said:
"Every man, woman and child in Ja
pan regards Russia as an enemy, and,
while the Government is disposed to
continue negotiations and avoid a con
flict if possible, the people are eager for
flict if possible, the people are eager
for the fray. Japan has a superb
navy, and her '. ships are manned
by splendid seamen. Russia must
have 50 per cent more tonnago
and men to stand "a show of winning
on the watar. And the Japanese army
is one of the most complete pieces of
military machinery in existence. The
quartermaster and commissary depart
ments are simply perfection, and tha
whole establishment will operate like
clockwork. The earller> stages of a
conflict, on both land and sea. would
undoubtedly be marked by success for
Japan, but the Government is undoubt
edly Justified in apprehensions as to
the ultimate outcome of the struggle.
Once, however, that it begins, the Jap
anese will fight to the last man and the
final ditch. It will be a contest of In
telligence . and agility on the part., of
the Japanese soldjery against the solid
ity and brute force of the Russians. It
i3 certainly not the intention of Russia
to relinquish Manchuria if only Japan
stands in her way. The Western pow
ers are, however, pledged to maintain
the integrity ot China, and if Russia is
not checked the United States will be
discounting the value of her achieve
ment in building the isthmian canal,
in so far as it may be intended to fa
cilitate trade In the Orient. .The Phil
ippines are- the gateway ta Asiatic
trade, but if Russia holds Manchuria
she will n.ixt appropriate Korea and
menace Japan. The United. States
should assprt herself,: and indicate to
Russia that the proper thing Is to go
"way back and sit. down."
The Doughty Jap.
A few months ago when night
prowlers were making their unwel
come presence felt in\th'e North Beach
section of the city the police were in
structed to keep a sharp lookout for
Pheir capture. It was a dark night
with only a few lamps shedding light
over the waters of the bay when a
young police officer in patrolling his
beat heard heavy breathing, accom
panied by long drawn out snores,
coming from an old shed on Mason
street. The of the peace
halted and placed " his . ear close to
the weather beaten boards; the longer
he listened the more convinced he was
that the gang- of prowlers had 'made
the place their headquarters. To capr
ture them single-handed would add
glory to his record, and perchance,
elevate him to 'the upper office. But
a trip to the Morgue was an item to
be considered; he might get killed in
the attempt.
He paused not long-, however, but
started off to the first call box and
sent a message for help to the central
office.. It was only a few minutes be
fore the patrol wagon and four burly
officers appeared on the scene carrying
with them bullseye lanterns and guns
galore.
The building was 'surrounded and
two of the bravest forced an entry,
with pistols drawn. The command.
"Surrender!" was-Â«iven in stentorian
tones and the light from the bullseye
lanterns was thrown all round the
shed. But not a human being wa3
seen. In one corner a dozen hog3,
snugly cuddled together, were snoring
Qeacefully.

The Paris correspondent of London
Truth tells an interesting story of the
manner in which the Russian. Govern
ment tested the efficiency of the French
detective police when the Czar was
about to visit Paris. The chief of the
Russian police went secretly â¢ to the
French capital with orders to lie quiet
ly by in a ho^el and only to report him
self at the embassy after, a stay of a
week. But he had not been three hour3
in Pari3 before the Prefect of Police
learned of his arrival from a French
detective. At St. Petersburg they
thought that a' satisfactory result and
the imj)erial pair ventured to go to-
Paris and drive down the Champa Ely
sees without cavalry around their car
riage. A similar test applied In Rome
had different consequences. The head
of the Russian police remained there a
v/hole week without his arrival beins
suspected^ On the evening of the sixth
day he called on Count Nelidoff to re
port himself, to the great astonishment
of that Embassador. They both agrreed
that If the Roman police had not scent
ed out the head of the greatest police
force in the world, they could not be
depended upon to know much about the
goings on of anarchists and nihilists.
â¢This is alleged to be" the true reason
why the Czar declined to trust himself
in the King of Italy's dominions.
v4 Crucial Test.
AT the annual banquet of the Merchants' Associa
tion, on Tuesday evening, a most cordial
response was given by the entire company to the'
arguments of the speakers of the evening in favor of
making a special San Francisco exhibit at the St. Louis
Exposition. There were even times when the cordiality
of the response approached enthusiasm; it was mani
fested by cheering that had a ring of genuine exultation
in it. Such responsiveness was, of course, not unexpected.
It was a festal occasion, the- report of the president of
the association on the work of the year had been grati
fying, the banquet had been excellent and the wine
abundant. Everybody was in good humor, and accord
ingly, all were ready to applaud every point made by
the speakers in favor of the good cause!
The banquet is over and gone, but the question of
the special display remains for discussion. It has
now to be discussed, however, not as Â¦ an after
dinner talk and a theme for flights of oratory,
but as a matter of business. If we are to
have an adequate display, there must be ample
funds provided for making it, and they should be
promptly forthcoming., It is not to be expected that
the response to the cold business proposition of raising
money, will be as enthusiastic as was the response to
rounded rhetorical flourishes of the post-prandial ora
tory, but, none the less 1 , it should be prompt arid liberal.
.; The issue is one of no little importance to the city.'
The: exposition will be the chief industrial and commer
cial feature of the decade. It will draw to St. Louis
thousands of enterprising men" from all parts of the
world and, ivhile most of the visitors will be there for
pleasure mainly and count for nothing more than casual
sightseers, there will be a host of men. studying the ex
hibits for the purposes of business in every department
of industrial and commercial activity. San Francisco
cannot afford to bo outside the arena of that great com
petition. We have much to show, and we should show
itl Our rivals' will be there, making their best efforts
at display. We, who are expecting great things from
the development of the Oriental trade, must' have on
exhibition . whatever products, natural or artificial, we
have to offer to that .trade, and also whatever ad
vantages, as a port, we have to facilitate It.
The exposition is to be nearer to San Francisco tfian
any other of its kind ever held. The visiting crowds will
b<v nearer to us than ever before and it will,- therefore,
be easier than ever to draw many of them westward, to
enjoy the coolness of our summer, the â¢ magnificence of
our scenery and to study the resources of our matchless
State and city. All these considerations combine to
strengthen the 'argument in favor of making a special
exhibit on a comprehensive scale. The work shoulcTbe
promptly supported and carried out with vim and vigor.
We must notpnly be at St. Louis, but we must be there
with a display that will attract attention, and compel
admiration. '
SAN FRANCISCO AT THE FAIR.
Business was particularly rushing
and the new clerk knew that he would
be expected to make a good showing
in the way of sales in comparison with
his fellow" clerks.
In the midst of the busiest hour an
important looking woman bustled up
to the counter and asked him to show
her some of his prettiest silks. Now
silks are expensive and a silk sale is
a big help to the day's receipts. Know
ing this the young clerk was very anx
ious to make good on the deal.
. As the time went by he thought how
hard some people to suit. Three
quarters of an hour was consumed in
the showing of the goods, but none
seemed to be just what the woman
was looking for. The clerk was con
scious of the floorwalker's penetrating
gaze and hastened in his efforts to
please the. prospective purchaser.
Finally when they had spent enough
time to take the entire stock of the
silk department the lady spotted a
piece that seemed to strike her fancy.
Her face lit up with a radiant smile
and the clerk got out his book prep
aratory to recording the record
breaker of the day.
To his chagrin the woman merely
said: "There, I knew it. I knew that
Mrs. Walker never sent to Paris for
that dress she wore the other night,
and I just wanted to satisfy myself.
That's the very same thing. Thank
you ever so much. I am sorry to have
taken your tim,e. If she "hadn't a dress
of that piece I'd get one myself."

And so â the friction grows less and
Ices. Fewer sparks fly. The teeth of
the cogwheels play together more
smoothly and quietly. The old energy
of conflict and contradiction has passed
into self-control and fine -nd noble
character is the resultant. It may seem

male heroes, and male gadflies : have

At any rate, however/self-mastery is
Complete self-mastery in matrimonial
conflicts is a long and difficult acquisi
tion. Probably it is fully acquired in
the fewcFt possible case?. But in. what
multitudes of houses it is developed to
such a point that daily life becomes
not only endurable, but blissful. Mar
ried people leara that they can control
themselves in the presence of each
other as well as in the presence of
strangers cr companions. "If I can
control myself before the meanest and
most aggravating boss in the world,
Â¦why can't I control myself in the pres
ence of my wife?" Brown asks his
conscience. "If I can goveni my re-
Fcntment over the cook's peculiarities,
why can't I over those of my hus
band?" Mrs. Jones inquires of her soul.
The thing to do with matrimonial j
friction is to transform it to character j
rÂ»ov.*-r. The transformation of the |
fierce^ energies of heat and light, of;
rushing: winds and falling waters into
beneficial potencies is the great prob- !
lem of modern science. It is accom
plished by a thousand wonderful de
vices, but not by any easy ones. It
took immeasurable genius and illimit
able consecration to discover and,per
fect them. Well â it is no easy thing to
tranFfoAi the friction of marriage life
into* beauty and strength of character,
but it can be done.
Xo quality in the sou! is nobler than â¢
that of self-control, and tt is this qual- i
ity that the quiet endurance of matri- ,
monial friction at last turns into. At j
first the sudden surprises of unknown '
traits of character, the differences of!
habit, of opinion, of taste, excite and ,
irritate the young married couple. Hot |
words follow and quarrels develop. !
There are tears of bitterness and re
gret. Days and perhaps weeks of
constraint and coldness ensue. But by
and by it begins to dawn on the mind
of ore or both that ihe other is also an
individual, with all an individual's'
right to his'or her personal identity,
judgment and opinion. And a sacred
moment it is when that lesson is fully
and finally learned. Probably nine out
of ten men expect to absorb a woman's
personality into their ownâ and the re
verse. We tvant that other will to be
submerged and shallowed up in ours.
It is madness, but it is human nature.
And so. when at last j we see and feel
the clear right of that other soul to its
individuality a first great step has been
taken.
.A second step is taken when we final
ly determine to endure in silence the
Incurable contradictions and opposi
tions in the characters of our husbands
and wives. "We have learned that noth
ing but discord end strife follows the
attempt to bend their wills or alter
their, temperaments to suit our own,
and we decide to Â£ake them as they are.
This involves self-repression. It is a
hard way to be taught it, but the worst
education which teaches self-repression
at the right time is better than the best
which teaches us everything else and
not that. Our poor self-love can be
reconciled to the sacrifice of everything
but itself. We are egotists, but each one
says: "Mine Is not, egotism, but con
scious power!" And when a irfan at last
learns to hold his own self down and

sometimes battering rams! These

den development of power in this fric
tion^ contact of which neither they

What is to be done with this new
power? Power is always either bane

ative. This incessant friction, in which

its mission be? I will answer this
question on the assumption that this
friction is inevitable on account of
temperament â for if life proves any
thing Â£t all, it is that there are tem
peraments that antagonize and irri

and perhaps unalterable necessity of
nature.

Germany's Brazilian colonies are

Now, most of the fluids secreted by
the glands which we have just dis
cussed are used in the process of diges
tion. . And in our next -article we will
describe some , interesting, features of
the digestive operation. . N \ . .
The glands of the stomach are' nu
merous and their function is" most im
portant. These glands are for the most
part simple or compound tubular â
that is, either a simple pit or tubular
opening, lined with filtering (epithelial)
cells, like a well lined with bricks; 'or,
a mere tubular opening with oth;rs
branching from it and called a com
pound tubular gland. The glands of
the stomach dip down into a fine, close
network of blood vessels (capillaries),
and absorb from the blood surrounding
them the elements required to form the
gastric fluid. In a state of hunger the
surface of the stomach is pale; and,
the blood flow being slight, the glands
are' also pallid and inactive. â¢' The taste
of. food, the introduction of food into
the stomach, or, in fact, even the
thought cf food, causes a striking
change in the appearance of the stom
ach lining and of the glands situated
upon it. There is an immediate and
marked increase in the amount of blood
sent to the stomach, its lining becomes
flushed and the gastric glands become
active ' and begin to secrete from the
blood and pour out into the stomach
the gastric juice.
The pepsin, which j is the principal
enzyme found in the blood, has the
power of changing proteid matters,
puch as white of egg and other sub
stances contained in meat, milk, le
gumes (peas, beans, lentils) and nuts
into what is called peptone, in -which
form they can be us^d by the body.
Then there are the intestinal glands,
which in form and operation are some
what - similar to the glands of the
stomach. The intestinal Juice is not
perfectly understood either as to its
composition or. its action. It is known,
however, to possess three enzymes, or
ferments, one an. amylolytic ferment
like the ptyalin of the saliva, changing
starch to sugar, the others changing
sugars into more digestible forms.
Among other glands in the body may
be mentioned the liver, the spleen, the
pancreas and the ductless glands. ;The
liver, 1 the spleen and the ductless
glands we will consider in other con
nections. The pancreas is an important
gland which V - in the abdomen near
the stomach and which, from its re
semblance to the salivary glands, has
been called the abdominal salivary
gland. It Is about seven inches long
and two in width. ,It secretes from the
blor " a fluid known as the pancreatic
juice., which has an important part in
digesting the food. The pancreatic
fluid contains at least four ferments,
amylopsin, which, like the ptyalin of
the saliva, changes starch to sugar;
trypsin, which, like the pepsin of ' the
gastric juice, changes- proteid to pep
tone; steapsin, which emulsifies fats,
and lastly, a ferment that, like the ren
nin of the gastric juice, causes milk" to
curdle.
This amylolysis, cr . conversion of
starch into sugar, is necessary before
the substance can be digested, .for
starchy foods, such as bread, cereals'
and most vegetables, cannot be digest
ed until they are converted into a spe
cial kind of sugar. The process is a
complex series of chemical changes, In
which the starch becomes in turn
amylo-dextrin, erythro-dextrin, achroo
dextrin. malto-dextrin and then mal
tose. This question will be more fully
discussed when we come to consider
digestion.
The saliva is a most important fluid.
Its chief value arises from the
presence in it of a substance
called ptyalin. Now ptyalin is an
enzyme or ferment. And a ferment is a
substance that has tha power of caus
ing certain chemical changes in other
substances. This particular enzyme,
ptyalin, is what is called an amylo
lytic or diastasic ferment, which simply
means that, when brought into contact
with starch, it has the power of chang
ing that starch into sugar.
First of all we may glance at the
glands of the mouth, the â¢ salivary
glands. These are very numerous.
There are three large ones, the parotid,
the sub-maxillary and the sub-lingual,
on each side; two small ones, Bland^n's
and Weber's, under the tongue dn each
side, and a great many minute glands
buried in the tissues of the lips, cheeks
and other parts. Each of these glands,
or perhaps n-e should say each* pair. of
tboee~ glands, elaborates a fluid pecu
liar to itself. These fluids combine to
form the saliva.
The glands of the body are so many
and so varied and the work they do is
so important that, besides the general
facts discussed in our last article, it
will be interesting to consider briefly a
few of the more important glands, how
they operate and whjit they produce.

Work of the Glands.
For the circumstances under which this treaty is
made the Democrats hav^ the authority of President
Monroe, who said the de facto government ot a country
is- the one for us to deal with. How? If not by diplo
matic recognition that carries the treaty-making, power
with it, how can we deal with a de facto government?.
The new treaty, as sketched by the President, is 'more
advantageous to us than any we can hope to make with
Nicaragua and Costa Rica, f6r the other route. It gives
absolute control of a strip across Panama twenty miles
wide, and equal control of three marine leagues 0>{~ the
water at each terminus, with 1 the right to fortify; and
exemption from taxation, other than the annual sub
vention of $250,000. ') It secures to us alsV the right of
sanitary control of Panama and Colon, that we may
exorcise from them yellow fever and other pestilence, as
we did from Havana. This is "of special importance, as
epidemics harmfully impair or entirely suspend trade.
The treaty of 1846 binds us as much-.to maintain .the
sovereignty of health on the isthmus as it does to secure
tnj- political sovereignty. It would be more than Vna
tionarfolly to reject this treaty, and. with it the oppor
tunity to complete the canal, which has been in the air
for a century and a half. It was the dream of Jefferson,
of Bolivar, of Humboldt and of every President of the
United States since 1801. It remained for opportunity
to knock at our door now and be invited in by Roose
velt and Hay. Let them be supported in a' spirit of
patriotism that forgets partisanship.
IT must be merely In a spirit of unreasoning partisan-,
ship that any one can oppose the* policy we have
pursued in Panama, after reading the President's
message on that subject. He has followed strictly in
the line of principles laid down by as eminent Demo
cratic authority as Polk and. Cass. The latter, ; as Secre
tary of State, said: "None of the local governments
having sovereignty of the isthmus; even if administered
with more regard to the just demands of other nations
than they have been, would be permitted, in the spirit
of Eastern isolation, to close the gates ot intercourse
on the great highways of the world and justify the act
by the pretension that these avenues of trade, and
travel belong W> them, and that they choose to shut
them, or, what is equivalent,, to incumber them with
such unjust relations as would prevent their generaT
use." . Â¦'':Â¦. : - Â¦:â¢Â¦;/:Â¦Â¦
Secretary Seward, interpreting the treaty of _ 1846, in
its guarantee of the sovereignty of New Granada over
the isthmus, .declared that its purpose was to guarantee
the isthmus only jfgainst seizure, or invasion, by a for
eign power. This view was concurred in by Attorney
General Speed,' and there exists nowhere any. dissent
to that view by any American statesman of any party.
It is entirely beyond dispute that; were either Cass or
Seward Secretary of State and Buchanan or Lincoln
President, exactly the same course would have . been
pursued that has been taken by Roosevelt and Hay.
Buchanan, in discussing this isthmian canal, went so far
as_ to declare for the seizure of the Sandwich. Islands, as
a safeguard to the Pacific' end of the canal, . and of
planting a protection of the other terminus by the same
sort \)f measures in the Caribbean Sea:
The governments of New Granada and Colombia
proved themselves utterly incapable, of maintaining
order on the isthmus. In the fifty-seven years elapsed
since the treaty of 1846 there have been fifty-two serious
outbreaks and revolutions there,, involving loss of life,
with an equal number of minor riots and disorders,
which disturbed commerce x and* rendered the use of
isthmian transit dangerous to all and expensive to. the
United States, since we have had to ' use our naval
forces to discharge our treaty, obligations and keep
faith with the world by keeping open the gateway of
intercourse.
Colombia failed to do her reciprocal duty. It is
easy to say that we must be policeman over the- sov
ereignty of Colombia,. on the isthmus, but she has done
nothing to dignify. that sovereignty, by making it -toler
able to those who were under it. Her dury was plain.
She had the opportunity -to discharge it by ratifying
the canal treaty, in requital of our half century
guardianship of her property. During all . that . time
Bogota was not in any way hindered or obstructed in
her isthmian- administration. She had every opportunity
to make it strong, enlightened and progressive, and she
took advantage of none.
The President tells the story concisely, forcibly and
with dignity. He makes it plain: that the whole peo
ple of the isthmus concur in the revolution and the
erection of the -new â¢* republic,- {'and that the< unpaid
national troops, enlisted" from other Colombian states,
who were on the ground when the change' was pro
claimed,, were in active sympathy with "the isthmians.
The de facto â¢ authorities of the new state being, by
the law of . nations, endgSi^d with the tr.eaty-making
power, â¢ have ustd .that power in concluding/ the new
treaty, which they, have jxow ratified, and â¢ the duty, of
the United States Senate to 'also' ratify it is now a
plain, patriotic and American duty, which we are' sure
will be discharged. -..."'
A cigar box, evidently containing:
something very precious, a little shov
el and a small tin bucket constituted
the burden cf a brave little tot who a
few days ago made her way into Gold
en Gate Park through the Haight
street entrance. She was a Very pret
ty little thing and attracted attention
because of the sad expression in her
big. blue eyes. *..'Â¦>
When but a short distance from the
entrance she left the path and disap
peared among the trees. An hour
later she eaine-out. She was minus
the box, but 1 the shovel and the little
bucket were still clutched tightly in
her chubby, dirt-begrimed little fists.
Traces cf te\irs were on her cheeks
and the big blue eyes were dimmed
by those unshed.
Prompted by curiosity a big police
officer Â¦ went down the path and en
tered the clump of trees where a
short time before the little mite had
gone with her shovel and bucket and
box. A little mound of freshly turn
ed earth caught his eye3 anjj stooping

hand. He soon uncovered the cigar
box and opening it found the body of
a tiny fox terrier puppy.

THE MESSAGE ON' PANAMA.
The critics' who are Â¦' fond of attacking courts would
better turn their wrathA upon juries. 'Such a verdict is
an encouragement of crime, an incitement to murder.
The crime of which Wood was guilty lacked none
of the elements of "murder in the first degree. It was
premeditated, deliberately : planned and cruelly exe
cuted. It had not "a single feature that, the law re
quires in murder in the second degree. It was not a
homicide committed in sudden passion. The plea of self
defense was inadmissible, since the murderer was com
mitting another, offense -when he- killed. The jury has
no justification in law, morals, decency or good citizen
ship. It simply forgot itsvoath, justified crime and put
a premium on assassination. It has made the duty of
every prison and jail officer in the State more difficult.
It has put the life of every such' officer in imminent and
constant peril. It has disgraced the administration of
justice and weakened the arm of the law. 1
If the jurors can contemplate all this with satisfac
tion, they are welcome to it. Such verdicts are one
cause of lynching, since they make even good citizens
despair of the criminal-law. The return of Wood to
prison, unpunished,' injures the discipline of the. peni
tentiary and nerves the arms of other desperate menTrj
follow his bloody example. But the people are power
less. The State has no recourse, no appeal, and justice
no means of getting satisfaction.

Robertson's body has beoii taken to
Oakland for interment. His wife Is ill
in a private hospital there. - '
' (Jororier Gormley said to-day that he
gave no Instructions whatever to BecÂ£
and that in fact he was' not. notified oÂ£
the death until- Monday evening, when
Hale stopped at his office to inquire
what he had done in the matter. Goim
ley expressed the opinion that. Beck's
purpose was to keep, the- death, quiet
until the body could be removed from
his house after nightfall without oc
casioning notoriety.
The autopsy on the body, showed
death was from tuberculosis. The Jury,
after questioning Beck closely concern
ing his practice, returned the verdict
disapproving Christian Science practice
when unaccompanied by a regular
medical treatment.
L. Cusanovich, a fellow employe of
Robertson, testified that about 4
o'clock Monday afternoon, while his
friend lay dead in the house, Beck told
him he could not see Robertson, but
that he was getting better, and Cusan
ovich went away, saying he would call
later in the day. Beck contradicted
Cusanovich'c statement and. defended
his own course before the jury by stat
ing that he had not tried to hide any
thing, but simply had not told all he
knew fo the parties who called. He
said he thought he was acting under
the Instructions of the Coroner in keep
ing the matter quiet.
Mrs. W. D. Kilborn, at whose house
Robertson had resided, testified that
she visited Beck's house at 4:30 o'cldck
MSnday afternoon and was told by
Beck that the patient wÂ«as resting
quietly and that she would be notified
of any chang-e In his condition.; At that
time Robertson had been dead more
than an hour.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 9.â In returning
a verdict on the death of William Rob
ertson, a bookkeeper. for Hale Bros. &
Co., a Coroner's jury has pronounced
against Christian Science practice un
less it is accompanied by treatment by
a member of the regular medical pro
fession.- The case which resultea in
this unusual verdict is one possessing
several singular features. Robertson,
while at work last Sunday, was sud
denly seized with illness. He refused
the aid of a physician, but at his re
â¢quest v/as taken to the home of Her
bert W. Beck, a Christian 'Scientist,
formerly a resident of Oakland. Rob
ertson died. at Beck's home* Monday
afternoon at 3 o'clock, according to the
evidence adduced "at the inquest.
But for some reason not apparent an
effort was made to conceal the fact 6t
the death from .the friends of Robert
son. . E. W. Hale, resident partner of
the firm of Hale Bros. & Co., testified
at the inquest that on Monday after
noon he went to Beck's house to see
Robertson and was denied admission
by Beck. Hale told Beck that Robert
son held an important position at his
store and he must see him. Meeting
with another refusal, Hale started up
the stairs uninvited, and then learned
for the first time from Beck that Rob
ertson was dead.

THREE REL\SOXS.

A Boston woman who is a fond
mother writes an amusing article
about her experience feeding her boys.
Among other * things she \ scys:
'Three chubby, rosy-cheeked lJoyB,
Bob. Jack and Dick, sigred 6, 4 and 2
years respectively, are three of our
reasons for using and recommending
the food, Grape-Xuts, for these
youngsters have been fed on Grape-
Nuts since infancy and often between
meals when other children would
have been given candy.
' "1 eave a package of Grape-Xuts to
a neighbor -.vhose three-year-old
child' was a weazened little thing, ill
half the time. The little tot ate the
Grape-Xuls and cream greedily and
the mother continued the good work
and it was not long before a truly
wonderful change manifested itself in
the child's face and body. The re-
sults were remarkable, even for
Grape-Xuts.
"Both wife and I use Grape-Xuts
every day and keep strong, and well
and have three of the finest, healthi-
est boys you can find . in a day's
march." Name given by Postum Co.,
Battle Creek, Mich.
Many mothers instead of destroying
Ue children's stomachs with candy
ar*i cake give the youngsters a hand-
ful v" Grape-Xuts when they are beg-
ging,/ for something in the way of
rvveett. The result is soon shown In
greatly-.VKcreased health,' strength and
mental activity.
There's Â» reason.

Consistency is all right, -but in ag
gravated cases it ceases- to be a virtue.
If only for the owner's sake, with the
public utterly disregarded, the Judges
should set down R. Wilson for incom
petency. The youngster has been rid
ing Byron Roge and The Je,w and has
demonstrated that he is still lacking
about three years of being a rider.

NEW YORK, Dec. 9.â Nearly all the
riders in the six-day bicycle race
showed evidence of strain at daylight
to-day. The sole topic of discussion
was the show of pluck made by W. C.
Barclay, who, rather than break his
contract with the management, con
tinued to ride while suffering from a
broken rib and numerous bruises re
ceived in a fall shortly before, mid
night. Barclay's pain was so great
that he could not reach out his hand
to take food from his trainers . while

out any attempt at concealment that
they had given him large doses , of
wha.t they termed "dope" before he
returned to the track. il.T.
Franz Krebs did all he could to re
lieve his partner by returning to the
track frequently. This rapidly, sapped
his strength and he, too, was forced to
lose^ome laps.
.At 6:30 o'clock Barclay and Rettich
retired from \ the race. Barclay had
then ridden nearly four hours after re
ceiving. his injuries. He was half car
ried to his quarters. Rettich's part

FOOTBALL GA3IE PROVIDES
THREE HOSPITALi SUBJECTS
Football Game on Xew Year's Day
Between the Big Colleges
: â¢ Is Assured.
BERKELEY, Dec. 9.â All obstacles
to an intercollegiate football game on
Xew Year's day between California
and Minnesota were swept away to
day, when a telegram was received
by Graduate Manager Ezra Decoto
from Minnesota, which contains an ac
ceptance' of the terms proposed by
California. - -
The game has been hanging fire for
nearly a week, " and at one time it
seemed there would be no game at' all,
as both sides were determined to carry
their point in regard to terms. Minne
sota wanted to pay its own expenses
and share in the gate receipts. To
this Manager Decoto objected, as he
preferred to pay all expenses and take
chances on there being a crowd big
enough to produce a surplus. For a
time the Minnesota people stood out,
but to-day settled the controversy by
wiring its acceptance.
Under the agreement California
promises to pay the expense of the
visiting party, which will include twen
ty players, and the coaches, trainers
and manager necessary to look after
the men and their interests. The visit
ors will be entertained in San Francisco
ten days, which means that it will
come to California ten days in advance
of the game and get the* advantage of
that time for practice and to become
acclimated. .
Manager Decoto says he will insist
on the Minnesota Varsity team. coming
to the coast, there having been rumors
that the Eastern university Intended to
send its second eleven. He will demand
a list of the players who participated
in the principal games in the East, and
unless a sufficient number come the
game will be called off. "
Medical and Dental Students Engage
in a Sanguinary Contest on the
Multnomah Field.
PORTLAND. Or., Dec. 9. â A game of
football played on the Multnomah field
between , elevens representing respect
ively the medical and the dental stu
dents of the city proved a sanguinary
contest. Three subjects for a clinic
were made in one down.
In the middle of the second half the
ball was downed in the center of the
field, and after the tangle of human
arms and legs had sorted itself out.
Right Guard Cree's leg was found to be
broken. Left Guard Gill's shoulder was
dislocated and two of , Left Half Rem
ington's ribs were caved in. The cas
ualties were due more to the players*
ignorance of how to protect themselves
against injury than to any unusual
fierceness of play. Â¦."';:

NEW YORK, Dec. 9.â The National
League of Professional Baseball Clubs
at its second day's session at the Ho
tel Victoria to-day decided to lengthen
the baseball season. This will not
allow the teams of the two major
leagues who win the pennants to play
for. the championship of the world.
The board decided that each club
shall play 154 games with each other
club, instead of 140 gaWes. as was
called for in last seasqpi's schedule.
The schedule committee will try to so
arrange the schedule that each club
will have enough off days so that
postponed games will not be played on,
the same day with schedule games.
The season will open about April
lo and continue- until October 10.
I The uniform contract approved by
the national commission was adopted
by the league. President Pullram was
instructed to vote at a meeting of the
national commission for a rule to de
clare Ineligible any player who Jumps
a contract with any league a party
to the national agreement.
The league adopted a rule that
clubs of the league must waive claim
to the services of a player before he
can be signed by a club for another
league. The rumor of consolidation
with the American League was denied
with a vehemence that seemed to set
tle the question for this year at least.

D. A. Phillips, who said he came from

shoe store from which he had been dis
missed because there was no further
need of his services. Two witnesses
testified that he devoted an entire aft
ernoon to hanging around the store
and pestering them, one of his acts of
annoyance being 'to pluck spectacles
from the noses of clerks who ( were com

so far did he go in this extraordinary

For not having a weeping wife and
two children, George Menoni, an Ital
ian, accused of having iottery tickets in
his possession, was fined $5' yesterday
by Judge Mogan.
When the case was called one of the
court attaches whispered to the bench
that the defendant's wife and twp young
children were in the corridor, weeping
piteously over the prospect of - being
deprived .of the company and support
of their natural protector. "Ah," said
the kind-hearted Judge, "I'm sorry, to
hear that. But we may restore thp
man to his helpmeet and little ones.
He has been in Jail all night, anyway,
and his offense is really trifling."
Thus prepared to temper justice with
mercy, the court requested the 1 Italian
interpreter to. have the woman and
children brought in. the evident inten
tion being to have them witness the
dismissal of the husband and father.
But no woman and/children could be
found, and then the court turned to the
defendant and asked where 'his family
had gone. An indignant denial that he
ever !iad or ever proposed to have such
an encumbrance as a wife, to say noth

against him, but the severity of his

J. K. Murakam, an Armenian, was
before Judge Mogan on a charge of
peddling chestnuts without a license,
a.nd pleaded his own defense with an
earnestness and wholesale quotation of
familiar legal phrases that impelled
the court to beg him to desist from the
mouthing of chestnuts. Then the de
fendant promised to equip himself with
the document necessary to the legal
selling of wares upon the streets and
the court dismissed him.
. George H. Buttle was driving, a pair
of spirited young horses on Market
street, opposite the Palace Hotel, last
Monday afternoon, when the team
crashed Into the rear of an automobile
of which Charles F. Tammany was the
sole occupant and necessarily the
helmsman. Then, as the evidence
heard yesterday by Judge Cabaniss
went to show, Mr. Tammany leaped
from his machine and grasped the
bridle of one of Mr. Buttle's horses,
whereupon Mr. Buttle struck Mr. Tam
many on the head with a whip. A
charge of battery was entered against
Mr. Buttle by .the^arresting policeman,
but Mr. Tammany and a special
pleader appeared In court and de
manded (hat an additional charge of
malicious mischief be filed against the
defendant, inasmuch as his horses, had
smashed the rear panel of the auto.
' Judge Cabaniss declined \to enter
tain the malicious mischief proposi
tion, and opined that carlessness was
the worst offense that " could reason
ably be charged against Buttle, who
apparently was unable to control his
horses when they smashed the choo
choo car. The charge of battery was
also pronounced not well made, as
Tammany had no right to arrest
Buttle, or to grab his horse's bridle
with that purpose, because it had not
been made " clear to Tammany that
Buttle had committed an offense jus
tifying his arrest.
In dismissing the case, the Judge
said that the conflicting rights of auto
mobolists and drivers of horses were
becoming more evident daily, and it
was the delicate duty of the court to
bar discrimination in its rulings' on
such disputes. "The autpmobillst . has
unquestionably come to stay," said the
Judge, "and in this court he will find
protection from imposition from ' per
sons who may harbor foolish preju
dices against the horseless carriage. At
the- same time, the driver of the time
honored beast of burden will get jus
tice, no more and no less, when he
comes before this court, either as com
plainant or defendant, in a case of
conflict with the driver of an automo
bile."

I'm going to give you a hearing to

George S. King, colored, told Judge
Mogan, that he. had acquired the pistol
carrying habit while he -was chasing
Morosin the. Philippines,, and became
so addicted to it .that in civilian life
he could not abandon it. .
Henry A. W. Clay, also colored, was
the complaining witness against Vet
eran King. It was adduced by Mr. Clay
that while he was a-walking the other
evening and "not intahfeahing wif no
body," he was met by Mr. King, who
cordially* suggested that they spend the
evening together at the residence of
Mr. Lampkins, likewise colored. Un
suspecting of treachery, Mr. Clay ac
companied Mr. King until they arrived
at an unfrequented spot somewhere on
Pacific Heights, where Mr. King sud
denly pulled out' a large pistol and,
presenting it at the head of the aston
ished Mr. Clay, demanded if that gen
tleman had uttered remarks derogatory
to the character of Miss Lillian Lamp T
kin, the daughter of the house to which
they were proceeding. As might have
been expected under the circumstances,
Mr. Clay pleaded not guilty, and suc
ceeded in appeasing the warlike spirit
of Mr. King sufficiently to have the
threatened shooting deferred until fur
ther inquiry could be made by that
gentleman as to the truth of Mr. Clay's
denial. So the twain resumed J their
journey Lampklnward until Mr. Clay
found opportunity to abandon his com
panion without dancer of being pur
sued and shotâ an opportunity which
was embraced as soon as presented.
Then Mr. Clay told his story to a po
liceman, who arrested Mr. King and
found concealed on his person a large
and fully loaded revolver.
: "A^lady | after. President Roosevelt's
own heart," was the court's comment
.The specific complaint of Mrs-. Flanni
gan, however, was that while, on her
way home from attending a wake she
overhQard Mrs. Hansen speak in dis
paragement of the worth of Mrs. Pe
ters,, and that when Mrs.. Flannigan
protested and attempted to defend her
daughter's character she was made the
recipient of a tirade of, abuse from the
defendant.
After hearing the narratives of Mrs.
Flannigan and others. Judge Cabaniss
told Mrs. Hansen that there was one
of three courses open to her â live at
peace with her neighbors, leave Decatur
street or go to prison. Then he gave
her a day in which to decide which of
the three courses she should follow.
Incidental to the hearing of Mrs.
Flanhigan's testimony it was learned
that eleven children have been born to
that matron and that ten of them are
alive.
Mrs. Isabella Hansen was the defend
ant on a charge of disturbing the peace
of Decatur street in general and Mrs.
Mamie Peters' tranquillity of mind in
particular.. Mrs. Flannigan, who is
Mrs. Peters' mother-in-law, was . wit
ness in chief for the prosecution and
her testimony depicted Mrs. Hansen as
a person who would be a disturbing
quantity in any well regulated neigh-,
borhood. Indeed, Mrs. Flannigan went
so far as to opine that if Mrs. Hansen
were sequestered on a coral island in
mid-Pacific she would manage to make
her environment lively.
Josephine Winship, convicted of hav
ing stolen $40 from William Duffey,
was fined $30, with the alternative of
fifteen days' imprisonment, yesterday
by Judge Cabaniss. Miss Briggs, an
agent of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, appeared in
court and requested that the organiza
tion represented by her be authorized
to take permanent charge of the de
fendant's four-year-old daughter, as
the woman did not seem to be qualified
to rear <the child properly. The appli
cation was taken. under consideration,
arid in the meantime the little one will

'Master and Journeymen Horaeshoers
and J. II. McCarty was president of
the executive, committee of the coun
cil, was the principal Witness yester
'day in the trial of the suit for damages
brought by McCarty against the mas
ters and the journeymen. His testi
mony was important In that it con
tained an admission that the Labor
Council had refused to indorse the
boycott against McCarty and that sev
eral of the masters and journeymen
had admitted to him that their, organ
izations were going to drive McCarty
out of business. ,
â¢ Benham's testimony .was not admit
ted without strenuous opposition by the
attorneys for the defendants. Most of
their objections were overruled. Re
duced to a connected tale, the evidence
of Benham is -as follows:
During the trouble of the hors<?*taoers t - the
masters and McCarty, I, as president of the
executive committee of the San Francisco
Labor Council, was waited upon by a com
mittee from the union and tne niuBters' as
sociation. They solicited from the Labor
Council an Indorsement of the boycott on Mc-
Carty. The Indorsement was refused and thÂ«
Journeymen were advised by the council not
to assist the masters in their tight asratnst
McCarty. They persisted, however, and told
mo that they were compelled to aid their em- ;
ployers under an agreement existing between
their union end the masters. Tom Parker. J
one of the committee and a member of the
union, told me such an agreement existed. I
was also told by one. of the commltteemen,
also by a Journeyman, that notwithstanding
the' refusal of the council to take a hand in
the row the fight against McCarty would be
continued. .' .
The petition of H. W. Jordan that the
sidewalks on Clement street from
Tenth to Fifteenth avenues be reduced
to fifteen feet wÂ»s referred to the City
Engineer for a report. .
The board will pass a demand to-day
for $27,287 34 In favor of the Barber As
phalt Company, which has completed
the renaving of Third street from Mis
sion to Berry.
The contract for the macadamizing
of the westerly side of Buena Vista
avenue, between Haight and Waller
streets, was awarded to Francis N.
Rodgers for $561 62.
The board approved the map confirm
ing and establishing the! extent and
boundaries of the district benefited 'and
to be assessed for the grade changes on
Fifteenth; Sixteenth.. Seventeenth,
Eighteenth, Nineteenth, Â¦ Twentieth
and Twenty-first avenues.
Action on the resolution to change
the grades on Parnassus avenue, J
street and Fourth avenue in the Byfield
Tract was postponed for two weeks at
the request of the attorneys for the Su
tro estate, which has protested against
the improvement on the ground that
it would, make the property of the es
tate difficult of access and . greatly
damage the residence value. A protest
against the change of grades was also
filed by the Regents of the University
of California on the ground that it is
undesirable and unnecessary, so far as
the best interests of the Affiliated Col
leges grounds are concerned.
City Engineer Grunsky submitted a
report on the cost of necessary repairs
to Market street between Second and
Sixth, which he estimated at $800, and
from Sixth street to Van Ness avenue,
ajt $300- Grunsky says the only method
that can be undertaken is to patch up
the breaks, regardless of the uneven
ness of the foundation, which has been
caused by the numerous trenches, and
raid repairs should be undertaken at as
early. a date as possible.
There was filed with the board the
approval by the War Department of
the location and plans for a bridge
over Channel street at Third and Ken
tucky streets.
The Board of Public Works yesterday
approved the map relating to the dedi
cation of Devisadero street, between
Fourteenth street and Duboce ave
nue. The land necessary for the open
ing of the street, a strip forty-eight feet
wid>2 and 560 feet long, was granted by
the Realty Improvement. Company for
the purpose. In recommending the
dedication of the street to the Board
of Supervisors, the Board of Works de
cided to Ignore the charter provision
that no street shall be opened up if its
distance from the "nearest parallel
p^reet is less than 200 feet. In this case
Devisadero street will be 180 feet dis
tant from Castro street, but the board
holds that it will be to the public in
terest to o^en Devisaderor street.
The board granted a permit to cer
tain property owners" for the construc
tion'of a safety station on Market
and Ellis streets,, with 'the provision
that it be sixty -feet long instead of
fcrty-eipl't feet, as sho'.vn In the plan
sul'initt?d. . . * :v*- '.'Â¦. '
The defense attempted to show that
neither Sullivan nor Powell fired the
shots that ended Sample's life and an
attack was made upon the character
and reputation of the murdered officer.
Sullivan was called to the stand and
testified that they had 'no words nor
trouble cf any kind with Sample at
First and Folsom streets and when he
advised them to go home they walked
quickly away in the direction of Second
street. When they had covered thre*Â»
fourths of the block, he said, Sample,
without warning,. struck Powell on the
head with his club from behind. Pow
ell grappled with him and Sample again
struck him with the club and said to
Sullivan, using a filthy expression,
that he would get him, too.
"I wrested the club from him," con
tinued Sullivan, "and threw it to the
ground. Then I hit him twice and he
fell. I saw three or four men running
toward us and I told Powell to run.
We had gone forty or fifty feet, when I
heard two shots fired in quick succes
sion. We slowed down, as we thought
the cops might be shooting at us, and
were standing when Policemen Clark
and Xobmann arrested us. I never
said to Officer Clark that Powell had
done the shooting. I did not hear Sam
ple say that I had shot him."
During Â¦> Assistant Attorney Ferral's
cross-examination of Sullivan, Ferral
protested that Attorney Coghlan for
the defense was coaching the witness.
Coghland said: "I was not coaching
the witness, and let me say that Juige
Ferral's conduct of this case from the
beginning has been outrageous," to
which Ferral retorted, "If my conduct
has been outrageous my friend's has
been ridiculous."
Charles Sullivan, who is charged,
with Jchn H. Powell, with the murder
of Special Policeman Robert A. Sample
on Folsom street, between First and
Second, early on the morning: of Au
gust 11, will soon know his fate. All
the last of the evidence was taken yes

counsel to the jury were* commenced
and will be concluded this morning in

The notorious "Jack" Evans was or
dered into custody yesterday by ."Judge
Fritz pending investigation of the con
stitutionality , of the law under which
he is being prosecuted by Mrs.Lovinia
'Raemsch, who alleges that he sold per
sonal property on which she held a
chattel mortgage. The woman man
ages an apartment-house .over the
saloon owned by Evans at 131 Taylor
street, and her complaint is a develop
ment" of the trouble which has existed
for some time between him and his for
mer mistress and her mother. Evans
has been in the courts â¢ on various
charges of assaulting women.

The petition of the pupils . of the
Polytechnic Kigh School that Mrs.
Irene D. Kteves be reinstated in her
position* as teacher in the department
was on file.
lamer B. McSherhy, Tr.sreclor of
School Buildings, .whose dismissal has
hcen crdered by the Board of Educa
tion, owing to lack of funfis, filed a
report yesterday with the Board of
Works to the effect that .ihere are
seventy-five school buildings which re
quire more or less repairs. McSheehy
states that the roofs of the Cooper.
Columbia, Garfield, Girls' High, James
Lick Annex, John Swett, Lincoln,
Marshall, Mission High, Pacific
Hefghts and Whittier schools are leak
ing: and require immediate attention.
There are 167 requisitions fcr various
repairs on file, and a new plumbing
system is only partly installed in the
Xoe Valley School.
The report was filed to show that
there is need of an inspector of build
ings in the* School Department. The
Board of Works, which employs Mc-
Shechy, has thus far failed to comply
"with the order of the Board of Edu
cation, and desires to retain him on
that account and because he is a civil
service employe. It would prefer to
dispense with the services of Assist
ant Inspector Connolly, whom the
Board of Education would return, be
cause he is a bookkeeper and can keep
the accounts.
The Board of Education, at its meet
ing yesterday, notified the Board of
Works that the salary of James B.
McSheehy, as Inspector of School
BuUdings, would not be approved after
December 2.
The grammar school certificate ' of
Mrs. Angie McManus was renewed by
the board, and a permanent grammar
school certificate was granted to Mrs.
Jennie Erkson.
Leave of absence was granted to
Miss Annette Murphy.
The petition of the Excelsior Im
provement Club, that an additional
portable Fchoo! building be placed on
the !ot of the Monroe Primary School
and an eighth grade class be installed
therein, was taken under adviseme'nt.

tition of the Excelsior Homestead

I Xelson was a native of Sweden, 28
years old and was a member of the
Bakers' Union. The body was dis
covered at 4:15 o'clock yesterday
morning by Chris Peterson, who occu
pied the adjoining room.
In the bed near his right hand was
a photograph of himself and a young
â¢woman .and the farewell message had
been written in pencil on her breast.
It is presumed that Nelson's inten
tion at first was to cut his throat with
the razor, but that he changed his
mind and resorted to a Ies3 gory
method of self-destruction.
"Good-by, dearest love," were the
last words written by Charles B. Nel
son, whose dead body was found in his
room at 2724 Twenty-fourth street
yesterday morning. The brief fare
well message was written on the pho
tograph of a young woman standing
side by side with him. In the room
where Nelson's body lay the key of the
gas burner was open and illuminating
gas niled the room. In the crevice at
the bottom of the door Nelson's trous
ers had been stuffed to prevent the gas
from escaping from the room. An
open razor lay on the bureau along
side a dirk knife. On the floor near
the bed was a bottle half full of
whisky.

Pride dies in the heart when love looks
out of the eyes.
ASTORIA, Or.. Dec. 9.â The Italian
bark Cavour, lumber laden, for East
London, South Africa, went ashore on
Peacock Spit last night and is a total
loss. The Cavour was lying In the
lower harbor and about 6 o'clock last
night began dragging her anchor// A
strong, ebb tide was running and an
easterly wind prevailed. Assisted by
the wind and tide the ship drifted rap
idly and all efforts to arrest her prog
ress failed. At 6:45 she struck on Pea
cock Spit and the seas pounded her to
pieces. Her cargo drifted out to sea
arid only the ribs of the ship are now
to be seen.. The members of the crew
were taken off in two boat-loads by
life-savers from Point Adams and con
veyed to this city on the tug Tatoosh.
Captain T. Loflanos of the Cavour,
in speaking of the wreck, said:
"We tried to get to sea Sunday even
ing, but the. rough condition of the bar
prevented, so we returned and anchored
near Sand Point Island. Tuesday even
ing about 6 o'clock we began to drift
toward the breakers, the anchors being
unable to hold the bark against the
swift current and the powerful east
wind. At 6:45 we struck Peacock fcspit
and the ship began to pound. The life
saving crews put out .to our assistance
at ihat time, but owing to the big seas
could not approach near enough to take
off the crew. At 11 o'clock last night,
however, this was done, every man be
ing saved. I alone was hurt, my right
ankle being sprained when the vessel
was pitching its wildest. The vessel
carried 1,036,000 feet of lumber."
The Cavour is owned by Domingo
Loero, by whom she was purchased in
1891. She was built at St. Johns, Nova
Scotia.
The cost of the building is estimated
on the basis of 60 cents per cubic foot.
Among the offices to be in the new
Custom-house building are those of In
ternal Revenue. Revenue Cutter Ser
vice, Lighthouse establishment. Har
bor Fortifications . Engineer, Rivers
and Harbors, Coast- Survey, Special
Agents, Chinese Bureau. Weather Bu
reau, Fish Commission, Livesaving
Service, Steamboat Inspection Service,
custodian's force and storage-room for
mes. ; \\ :â¢':/: \ .
Plans for:! the new Custom-house
building in San Francisco are required
to be in the hands of the supervising
architect of the Treasury Department
at Washington, D. C, by 2 p. m. of
December 16. The architect who repre
sents the plan selected will be appoint
ed architect of the building, arid will
be required to m^ike ail the drawings
for the work, his compensation to be
5 per cent of the actual cost of ,the
building, ri or $70,000 of the estimated
cost of $1,400,000. The unsuccessful
architects will riot receive anything
for their plans. The following are the
names of the competing architÂ«3ts, to
gether; with the location of their of
fices: D. W.-Willard, Redlands, Cal.;
A. F. Rosenheim, Los Angeles; Whld

On the completion of the new Post
offlce building in this city, the present
Custom-house will be, demolished and
the new one erected on its site. The
building will be fireproof and five
stories high, occupying all the ground
of the present building, including the

Great Good Is Done Sailors
by Kindlv People Who
Maintain Free Quarters
OFFICERS OF MISSION'.
The irstitute. or mission, is one of
these that have been established in
various seaport towns. The aim Â«>f
the mission is to provide a place for
the sailor so that he can have a home
and not be compelled to look to the
many grog shops and barrooms of the
water front for his amusement.
All of this work is done by contribu
tions from people interested in the
good work. Last night the weekly
concert was held. Captain Steel of
the British chip Simla presided and in
his amusing seaman's style announced
the various selections from the pro
gramme. The boys ably assisted with
songs, recitations and dances, and the
evening flitted away merrily.
The officers of the San Francisco
Mission to Seamen are: President, the
Right Rev. \Y. F. Xichols. D.D.. Bish
op of California; committee â John Met
c:alfe (chairman), "William Babcock,
W- J. Dutton. James Hogg, W. D.
Clark." C. F. Mullins. W. R. Sherwood.
C. D. Haven and A. B. Williamson;
treasurer, James Hogg, 13? Spear
street.
Meals are served to the needy at
Email cost. D'-wnstairs is one of the
neatest Mttlc chapels in ths city. Here
those who care to attend have the
privilege of hearing a good sermon on
a Sunday. In every way imaginable
these good people have made a home,
in the true sense of the word, for the
man who follows the sea.
Every Wednesday night there is a
concert participated in by the sailors.
Bongs, piano solos, recitations and
dancing form the evening's enjoyment.
On other nights the seamen enjoy fenc
ing, boxing end other athletic sports,
even football matches being played i:i
the large concert hall of the mission
by teams from the different ships at
anchor in the harbor.
For the men who. cannot write, let
ters are written. The chaplain banks
the extra money, of the sailor, and in
this way much good hard-earned coin
is saved instead of being "blown in."
Last year the institute banked more
tha" $14,000 for the man before the
. Â¦
mast.
Every night and day in the week the
place is thronged with the sailors who,
far from their homes, partake of the
hospitality Fhown them by Chaplain S.
H. Winfield Digby and Rev. R. Mac-
Liebenroorf end wife. There are games
of billiards, pool, ping pong, baths, pa
pers in the different languages, maga
zines of all ports and writing material,
bo that the men of the deep can write
home to met her and the dear ones.
SAIIXm IS BENEFITED.
Down on Steuart /Street, close to the
shipping of the city and in the midst
of the grog shops that abound there,
is a little place where the sailor far
from home can bo and enjoy himself
â¢withc-ut the aid of firewater. AH are
welcome, no distinction being made as
to a man's color or race by the good
people who control this place â the Sea
men's Institute. The objects of the in
stitute bs set forth in the prospectus
are "to enable men of all nations to
become cood citizens of every king
dom on earth now, in' order to make
them cood citizens of clod's kingdom
cf heaven in the future."

NEW "YORK. Dec. !>. â Another active and
exceedingly irregular market to-day gave evi
dence of a growth of variety and interest in
the speculation, although the total dealings
I fell slightly below those of yest< rday. It
was perfectly obvious to the most casual ob
server that there was an enormous unload
ing of stocks to take profits by ihcse who had
bouskt lower down, but the . sealing* was not
pursued at' the expense of values. - and there
were recurrent rallies In the eer>eral list.
There was a general agreement also that some
j of the most conspicuous strength of the mar
-I ket was due to flagrant' mcnlpulttion, and
that this was designed to cover nulling to
realize elsewhere. But there was fairly good
absorption of the selling and a growing hope
of an awakening interest in the market on the
Part of the outside' public. The professional
I element of stock speculators Is devjily imbued
with a conviction that no widespread demand
for securities is ever induced without the pre
liminary invitation of a spectacular and man
ipulative advance in prices. Th<- fact that
the conditions in the money market have be
come such as to allow- resources for this kind
of campaign and that conditions at large
have attained a state which relieves the stock
market from an overwhelming flooJcr liquida
tion upon any advance in prices are lyoked
. upon by the average speculator as quite 'sub
stantial grounds for bullish enthusiat-m. The
!eaderghii> of the market to-day shifted baefc
to Urooklyn Rapid Transit and Amalgamated
Copper. Brooklyn Transit roue ."t^. There
f is a deeply ingrained theory In the speculative
world that all the New York public utilities
i will be broueht ultimately under a single con
â¢ trol. giving opi>ortunlty for Important eco
j nomi<-s, especially In the matter of electrical
liower. This was the basis of to-<lay's great
PDeculatlon. but so far as coul.l be author
itatively learned there was absolutely no new
development bearing on the conjectured out
come. The adootion by the Montana Senate
of the so-called "fair trial" bill intended for
copper litigation was the only news affecting
Amalgamated Copper, and the speculation in
j that stock principally influenced by the
varying Burmlpes as to whether the Standard
OH interests were buying or pellmc in the
market. The stocks which were strongest and
most active yesterday during the pause for
profit-taking in the advance of Brooklyn Rapid
Transit and Amalgamated Copper -acre freely
pold to take profits to-day. The Â«elling move
ment became comprehensive in the last hour
and left net gains only for the stocks men
tioned for particular strength. Additional
Kold was taken in London to-day, but that
center cc.ntinued to send orders here to buy
stocks. It is -paid that these- holdings are to
be carried In New York and with money bor
rowed here. The real origin of the orders Is
cpen to conjecture. Chicago is credited with
lance buying of stocks and with some lend
ing of money here also.
A feature of the money market was the re
ceipt by telegraphic transfer of *1:}!>,<X>O from
Fan Francisco and a moderate outgc to New
Orleans.

"Th* hotter tone to the stock market antici
pated in these advices continues, and does nnt
jet appear to have run its cour*>\ During thÂ»
past Â»Kk the upward movement was stimu
lated by a class of tuying that previously
had been conspicuously wanting. Large in
terests unquestionably pave the' market
*tronÂ«rer support, and the change In sentiment
forced considerable buying on short account,
thus developing an additional element of
Â»trenjrth. Apart, however, from puch support
*s may have been derived from these sources,
the renewal of gold bSpOtta had a i^ronounted
*ff*rt upon 5perulative sentiment. Ne?r!y $3.
f.(i0.<iOO r old was ensas^d this week for im
|>ortation. making a total thus far this season
{ oT about Sl.i.'JUt.uO". Thlt is primarily due to
â¢the incrÂ»-af*-d pro<Juotion of Pouth African
tnines. shut off originally by the Transvaal
Â¦war. London. In consequence, ha? become dis
tinctly more ontimiptie. ar.d the revival of
tribulation in Kaffirs on thtA market ha? ex
erted a stimulating eff<ct upon oiher Fharep.
The intrrr.ational situation as a whole has also
distinctly imj>rovÂ«i during the iast few roor.ths
rÂ»sulting inevitably in a better tone in finan
cial circles. British Industry shows irfgr.s of
revival after recent deprt^ion while the in
dustrial recovery In Germany from the crayh
of two or thre* years ago has slso b?en quite
pronounced.- Foreign munufacturers now cn
trrtain less fear of the '"American peril" than
they did two yrars ago, their costs of pio
duction having fallen, while our? have ris^n;
Â¦ nd the result is. a moro cheerful feeling gen
erslly abroad, which affects the financial cen
ters favorably, and is finally reflected upon this
center through a greater willingness to send
"us grold. Thcrr is but one cloud oil the for
eisn horizon, and that is ih? strained condition
Of affairs in the Far East: though even there
no immediate trouble* are in sight.
OUR FOREIGN CREDITS.
" Another satisfactory element in the gold
movement is that we are accepting actual fay
Â¦mer.t for our products instead of extending our
credit* abroad, as we did at this season in
ltt*!2 and lÂ»ol. Then, it will lie remembered,
our borTo-uings abroad were rising higher and
higher, until foreign bankers began to hesitate,
Â«"Ven when considering our .magnificent re
sources. Then Wit krpt our hanK reserve in as
pood shape as possible by borrowing heavily
abroad w-here it could r.ot easily be detected.
Naw we have very largely liquidated these for
eign loans, eo that our financial situation has
improv.d much mere than indicated by cur
local bank stetemer.t. That illuminating doc
ument still shows loans at a very high figure
and reserves very low. Unquestionably, th^
J^anks i,Â»*hJ to Improve their txhibits in this
if-spÂ«-ct; anil yet it is important to bear In
mind that the situation is much better than â¢Â¦
such com2>arisons nith last yÂ»-ar nujrge.st. The
whclesjUe liquidation of the jjast -eleven raonthÂ«
has materially out down the over-extt rjsloa vl
tredit which then existed.
"Activity t.as befn rh'.efly centered upon j
railroads which are doing a profitable business. |
or upon thosÂ«Â» roads wh*-re the growth of traf- I
fie giies an additional element of stnrtgth. '
Shrewd invfgtrrwnt bu>-ers. who look for lower ;

class railroad shnres. which were unduly tie- !
pressed by forced liquidation. This rendered
upward manipulation the -more r-aay. At. the
higher prices there was considerable profit

progresses, though thus far it has failed to

opine Speculation, however. Is not confined
to the .--.'Â¦Â¦:. market. Cotton touched high
record prices on the short crop showing of the
Government report, and coffee now appears to
offer attractions to the speculatlvely minded.
As for cotton, it must h* said that white the
crop is unquestionably short the price has al
ready advanced considerably above normal, and
very soon the staple wiil have to face an in
evitable ehrlnkane in consumption. Coffee; on
the other hand, has been phenomenally low for
a dvriets of years, discouraging production to
a point that rr.'-ans shorter crops "-JThd better
prices until a larger growth iÂ« obtained â a mi:
ter of reveral seasons, not months.
THE MONETART SITUATION.
"The moneUry situation is satisfactory.
Finn rates appear likely until after th<? Jan
uary disbursements or the middle of next
month, when easier conditions are . likely to
prevail.' Funds are now returning from the
crop sections, and bank reserves ought soon
to be strengthened by this and the import
movement. "Hie January investment demand
has Â«Jso to be taken into consideration, and is.
no doubt, one of the factors in the present
rise. A good deal of interest is ehown in the
Panama payment. Its effect trpon the mar
ket, however,' like all events foreseen, will
probably be Flight, for the reason that tl-.e
Government -will aim to disturb it as little as
possible, while bankers will make their pre
parations in advance. Evidently they see their
way clear ehead. or gold would not be Im
ported so freely.
"Indications point to Increased speculative ,
activity for a period, largely the result of re
action after extreme depression. There is no
likelihood, however, of any extreme advances,
but rather a gradual evening up of priccÂ« after
the leaders have risen to their limit. Pur
chase* should therefore be made with discrim
ination and profits secured 00 good advances."

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
Hay. market continues firm and in good. shape
for sellers.- The circular of Somers'&' Co. 1 says:
Â¦ .; '.'Hay shipments for the last- week show a'to
tal | of 255<> . tons, an ' increase 'â¢ in receipts over
the past week' of 950 tons. The situation â¢ re
mains unchanged, however, for the interior de
mand is very good Â«and export trade . continues
faisly active, consequently prices are still hold-
Ing' firm at the range quoted last -week. Con
sumers of hay here, who filled up I their barns
during the summer and early fall, . are about
ready to go on the market again, and this,
with the large order â¢ the - Government is ex
pected to place here, is sure to have its effect
on prices. Inquiries Jiave .been received lately
from many points where it was supposed they
had sufficient hay to last them through the
season,* and It may bo that before the season is
over hay will be shipped from here to unex-.
pected consumers. Â¦ Â¦ ' After considering ! these
facts carefully and remembering that the ton
nage of hay available to this market Is not
.very large, we cannct see but one outcome : to
the local hay situation and that is that prices
will advance, perhaps to a figure that will sur
prise not a few. â¢
â¢â¢The good grades'pt wheat hay still const!-,
tute the bulk of present arrivals and are being
dlsf.osed cf readily. Alfalfa Is shipped in spar
ingly, but the (demand for this grade 'is not
very- brisk.- Straw is in Kood demand with
light -arrivoJe, ns - Is also Â« the case with . the
cheaper -grades of stable hav.".. , Â¦. . - (

KANSAS CITY JUDGE
WAXTS v GOO D PKOBDfQ
Jurist Gives Grand Jury Explicit In
structions Coaccrnins Bribery and
Malfeasance In Oder.
KAX3A3 CITT. Mo.. Dec. 8. â When
I the Grand Jury called to investigate
| alleged Doodling in Kansas City. Kans.,
f met to-day Judge Fisher of the Dis
i trict Court save explicit instructions
i regarding its work. '^.
"For yecrs," caJd he. "it has been
commonly rumcred and often openly
charged that public oSlcials of the city
of Kansas City. Kara., were in the
j habit of soliciting and receiving bribes.
â¢ In this community there has grown to
| be a sentiment that pure municipal
! government la an unobtainable thins;
that corruption in office is a conven
tional crime; that every man has his
price. Such a condition Qf affairs i3
i appalling and damoralizing. and no
[good citizen will refuse to assist in
I eradicating it.
"There is no offense more despicable
than the betrayal of a public trust for
private gain.
**I-et no bribegiver nor bribetaker
or corrupt public official escape."
j The instructions call for the investi
gation of the prohibitory Ian-, as well
as malfeasance in office. Attorney
General Coleman of Kansas was preÂ»-
I ent in court and will take charge of
the investigation.

Deputy Coroner P. J. McCormick
made an investigation into the circum
stances surrounding the fatality and
gathered the Information that Alex
bright was seated on an Iron beam on
the seventh story when the breast der
rick fell backward, and the presump
tion is that the workman. In trying to
get out of the* way, lost his hold and
was precipitated to the ground.
Henry Rosenbohm; who Is in charge
of the men working on the seventh
story of the building, told of the der
rick falling backward to the floor.
He saw Axelbright Jump over the
girder to get out of the way. At that
time Axelbright was holding onto a
rope attached to the derrick. Rosen
bohm did not see him fall. Rosenbohm
said that the derrick was in good
working order.
A. S. Ballantine, superintendent of
the stef-1 construction, was on the fifth
floor at the time of the accident.
Ballantine said the derrick fell back
on the . floor, but he could not ex
plain how it was that Axelbright came
to fall. Ballantine said that all ma
chinery used in the construction of the
building was in perfect condition.
Policeman T. P. "Walsh .was almost
the first at Axelbright'3 side after he
fflL Ho gave him whisky to revive
him" and the unfortunate man. who
was suffering acute pain, begged that
his leg should not be touched and then
became unconscious. He was uncon
scious when he arrived at the hos
pital, where an examination of his in
juries by Drs. Maher and Murphy
showed that there was no possibility
of saving his life. The right arm was
almost torn from its, socket, the right
hip joint was fractured and he was in
jured internally.
Axelbright had been married only
four months, and lived with his bride
at 904 Howard street. He was a Dane
and 33 years of age.
Within the period of two weeks two
men have lost their lives on the new
building in course of construction for
the Merchants' Exchange.
On November 2S W. D. Rankin fell
several stories to the ground, and yes
terday Fred Axelbright, not many
hours after he had been served with a
subpoena to give evidence as to the
cause of the ' tragic death of his fel
low workman, fell from a height of
seven stories, striking within five feet
of where Rankin. had landed. Axel
-bright's injuries were of such a seri
ous nature that he expired half an hour
after . his admission to the Central
Emergency Hospital.
Ij. B. Dutton, superintendent of the
building, who was on the ground floor
at the /time of the accident, heard an
exclamation and, looking round, saw
a man's hat falling, but did not see
the man.
Elfros was 65 years old and a na
tive of Russia. He had followed the
business of a building contractor up to
the time that he lost an arm by the
falling of a steel beam in the Mills
building, on which he had a sub-con
tract. Latterly he had been employed
at odd times as a watchman.
Landlord J. J. Sweeney of the lodg
ing . house at 114 Pacific street ad
mitted to Deputy Coroner Brown yes
terday that he had been in the habit
of turning the gas off at trie meter
between '8 and 9 o'clock in the morn
ing and turning it on again at 4 or
4:30 in the afternoon. The subject
that led up to that admission was the
dead body of Frank Elf ros. who had
been suffocated" in bed by the fumes
of illuminating gas which had escaped
during the night,, from a burner, the
key of which was partly open.

SEVEN STORIES
C. A. S. "Frost delivered an interest
ing 1 lecture to the members of the San
Francisco section of the Navy League
at the Chamber of Commerce building
last night. Mr. Frost went into details
regarding the Monroe doctrine and ex
plained how the' country could be en
tangled in war with other powers. A
large crowd was present. â¢ .
Talks to Xavy League.
The witness testified that all this
happened in Portland, Seattle, Spo
kane, Tacoma, Ellensburg ; and other
towns in the Northwest, where the
company played short engagements.
The affections of the two even con
tinued after their arrival in this city
and they were often together.
The trial will be continued this
morning at 10 o'clock. Mrs. Hawes
will again take the stand and tell
something else about Wilkerson. Other
witnesses will be examined.
According to the fair and forgetful
witness Wilkerson lavished attentions
galore on Myrtle Rosedale, one of the
members of the company. Miss Rose
dale was also smitten with the charms
of Wilkerson, according to the admis
sions of the witness, and together they
made a. happy pair. She was his "lit
tle squaw" and he her '"dear, old
daddy."
That they were on intimate terms
the witness swore. Miss Rosedale was
in the habit of forsaking them ' and
going with Wilkerson. Nor did she
seem abashed at her conduct .and
never tried to hide anything from her
roommates, the witness and Anna Gor
man.
MAKES LOVE TO SOUIJRETTE.
The witness' testified that she was
married but a short time ago and that
her former name was Ovite Leathe.
She stated that she sent the letter to
Miss Amber before she was aware of
the infidelity of Wilkerson. She learn
ed of this later, while the "Fiddle Dee
Dee" company was on the road in the
Northwest..
Mr. dc Forrest is mistaken when he says 1
saw your husband kiss Bertie. I did not.
He has always been a perfect gentleman and
has been friendly with all the girls and has
never treated Vny ot us but as ladles. Yours
sincerely, OVITA LEATHE.
She testified to having received the
following letter and sent the answer to
Miss Amber:
FRISCO, 11-20. 1902.
MIrs I^ath-s:
I want to ask you somethinR, and I want you
to tell me the truth. I>id you see my husband
kiss Birdie Starrett? You can rest assured if
you di<l. and say so. Your poeltlon will not be
Jeopardized In any way. Mr. de Forrest says
you said It one time when she fainted, and that
you, with acme of the other girls, said It was
perfectly disgusting. Wire me your reply at
my expense. Yours very truly,
MAUD AMBER.
Piease tell me the truth.
Witness testified to having sent the
following reply to Mis3 Amber:
Nov. 23, 1902.
Miss Amber â Dear Madame:
I never, as long as Bertie Starret was with
our cempany, saw Mr. Wilkerson treat her oth
erwise than as any man nf his age would treat
a child of her age who was away from home
for the first time in her life. . â¢
RECEIVES A LETTER.
The chorus girl got along very nicely
while being directly examined by At
torney William Humphries, but as soon
as Lawyer Newbrough began a cross
examination, her mind suddenly took
a wandering turn and it never ceased
to wander for a moment while she was
on the stand. She did not remember
any streets further west than Powell
and when dates were brought up the
poor girl was really mystified.
Miss Amber was the - first witness
called, and she said what was required
of her cheerfully. She stated that she
married Wilkerson in Kansas City
in December. 1S90. They lived for
a time in New York and various
places and came to this city in
1901. Miss Amber did not seem to
know much about the infidelity of her
husband, but she left all that to Mrs.
Hawes," who was quite familiar with
the Inside details of what happened oh
the road.
The entire day was taken up in ex
amining Miss Amber and the chorus
girl. The former was on the stand but
a few minutes during the morning ses
sion and had little to say. The chorus
girl was given a chance to talk freely
when her turn rolled around, but she
proved about the most forgetful sort
of person that ever evaded the court
room. ' k .
Maude acted as chaperon for a
bunch of fair ones from the O'Farrell
street playhouse. They were all
adorned with their swagger apparel
and wore picture hats for the finishing
effect. They seemed to have a grudge
against Wilkerson, and when not busy
craning their necks to catch bits of
spicy testimony, they varied the mo
notony by shooting needle-like glances
at the defendant, who sat a few feet
away.
,The trials and tribulations in the
married life of Ira Puerl "Wllkerson and
his wife, Maude Amber Wilkerson,
came up for their first official airing
in Superior Judge Murasky's court
yesterday morning. The footlight ' fa
vorite charges her spouse with infidel
ity and, according to the testimony of
Mrs. Ovita Hawes, a chorus girl, Wil
kerson was in the habit of making vio
lent love to Myrtle Rosedale while on
the road with the "Fiddle Dee Dee"
company.
Under the inscription .of "F. B,
Cook and wife, of " Sacramento,"
James A. Cunningham, a wealthy
mining man of Salt Lake," and â¢ his
fair young bride.aiso of the same city,
endeavored yesterday to conceal their
presence at the Palace Hotel, while
they entered upon their honeymoon.
The culmination of their marital ro
mance, which began' with ' the aged
capitalist's quiet departure from Salt
Luke, followed by. that of Miss Bessie
Glass, a former milliner of the Mor
mon City, who Joined him in this city
Tuesday, occurred yesterday after
noon, when the couple, despite the
protests from the mining man's chil
dren, secured a license and were
promptly . married.
Late yesterday afternoon Cunning
ham and Miss Glass visited "Cupid"
Danforth's office at the City Hall, ob
tained a marriage license and immedi
ately after repaired to the chambers of
Justice of the Peace Daniells, by whom
the nuptial knot was tied. In the ab
sence of friends of the bridal couple
Justice Daniells pressed into service as
a necessary witness to the ceremony
a courtroom clerk, and ten minutes
later Mr. and Mrs. Cunningham were
journeying back to the Grand Hotel,
where they had made their separate
abodes the night previous. In his ap
plication for a license Cunningham
gave his age as 60 years and that of
his bride as 2S.
Arriving at the Grand, Cunningham
promptly paid his bill and ordered a
porter to take his own as well as his
wife's baggage .to the Palace Hotel,
where it was ordered stored. This
move was apparently Intended as a
ruse, with the view of throwing in
quisitive people off his .track, tor a few
minutes later, the bride ana groom
quietly entered the Palace, where the
latter . registered "F, B. Cook and
wife, Sacramento," :.-. and they were
shown to their rooms.
Cunningham last evening expressed
himself as indignant qver the publicity
given to his matrimonial affairs, which
he attributes to the meddlesome dispo
sition of ssveral of his wife's acquaint
ances in Salt Lake. The fact that he
had been married before and was the
father of several grown children, he
said, was no reason why he should, not
be permitted to marry again, and in
doing so he remarked that he did not
think it within the. province of friends
or relatives to surest whom he should
engage as his fireside companion.
"This plan is now worthy of further ;
attention, for, if my memory, serves me [
aright, the depth Intended and already â¢
cut is insufficient for ships now being i
built; therefore, the so-called 'finished ,
part' must be gone over and cut to the !
required depth. Health conditions to I
be considered are not only those which j
concern the laborers now, but the crews :
and passengers of the ships going j
across the isthmus. A deep cut under a j
tropical sun, with its malarial atmos- {
phere, might soon become too unpopu- j
lar to use, except in exceptional cases. !
The covering with salt water of the ;
swampy, portion, thereby destroying |
malaria, and the crossing at a high alti- j
tude where : probably a strong draft of.
pure air would be In constant flow, is
no small advantage offered by the plan â¢
of M. Santareau." !
Civil Engineer Joseph Voyle, a'resi
dent of Berkeley, who has had many
years' experience in Central America
in mining and engineering work, said
in an interview, yesterday that he fa
vpred" the plan of M. Santareau for
cutting the Panama Canal.
Said Mr. Voyle: "About the year 1890
a variety, of plans were proposed for t
the completion \ of the Panama Canal, j
One of the most notable of these was ;
that proposed by M. Santareau, that !
instead of following M. de Lesseps' Â¦
plan of a sea level canal, there be made
a lake on the high level, with guick-j
acting locks to raise and lower the ves- {
sels to and from the level of the lake. |
This, body, of water, he estimated, \
would cover twenty-four kilometers of :
the distance, leaving only fifty kilome- j
ters of cut for docks and water levels. â¢
By this plan the largest portion of the i
swampy land would be covered, and |
thus nearly the whole, of the 500,000 .
hectares of land owned by the canal j
company would be rendered habitable. !
The waters of the Chagres River would j
be utilized also, and one of 'the most i
troublesome problems of the route j
would be disposed of. !
