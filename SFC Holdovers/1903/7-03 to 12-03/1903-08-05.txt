MINERS' NARROW ESCAPE.
The pos?e will go with the bloodhounds

place where they camped and the dogs
will be put on the trail.
A report was received In Plymouth to
r.ieht from OJeta that Edgar Malone, a
rancher, who lives at Cfdar Grove, had
feÂ£ five convicts last night. AH were
hravlly armed. Thry appeared extreme
ly, worn. After eating the outlaws took
a. course toward Volcano and are now
thought to be in Arnador County.
James A. George and E. J. Smith of the
Gamecock mine, a few* miles' from Lotus,
had a narrow escape from death at the
hands of a posse headed by Guard Sea
vey. The two men were returning from
fixing a water ditch and were on their
way back to the mill along the main road
when, they were fired upon without warn
ing. This occurred near Jacobson's ranch.
Seavey had ten men with him and a vol
ley of ballets were fired at George and
Smith.
EARLY MORNING HUNT.
The posse sent from here to-day with
the bloodhounds cf C. P. Ferrell of Reno,
New, has reached Lotus. J. A. Spencer,
formerly a {ruard of Folsom prison, tel
ephoned to-night to Sheriff Bosquit that
the posse had viÂ«!ted Ingram's mine and
verified the morning report that three
large cans of food had been stolen from
the Ingram stove In front of the cabin
during: the night. The trails showed that
two- men had gone 4(W yards from the
cabin and camped.
Sheriff Bosquit is highly pleased at the
prospect of the convicts being caught
by Ncwnan's posses. The country where
the. convicts are now Is not to heavily
covered by brush and there is not so much
danger cf the convicts ambushing the
posses.
The trail cf the murderers was unÂ»
mistakable and to-night it is estimated
that the convicts are on the way between
I>ogtown and "Westfalls. following the
middle fork of Cosumnes River and head
ing due cast toward Silver Lake. "
Sheriff Norman of Amadcr County ar
rived late to-night at Oleta, about ten
miles south of where the convicts are
thought to be. He will travel all night
with a large posse and Indians as trailers,
and will arrive at Loekwoods early in
the morning. Then he will travel along
the Amador County line, south of the
Fouth fork of the Cosumnes River and
will make fast time and get Into the
eastern portion of El Dorado County and
head the convicts off.

where he delivered a sealed niessace to

T. F. Garner, a plasterer, accompanied
by his wife, went to the services, arriv
ing quite early. Behind them Bat two
men, and soon Garner struck up a con

"Do you know anybody here named
Garner?"
"That's my name," said the man ad
dressed.
"What, are you the brother of Charles
and- William and Buck and James Gar
ner?" said the astonished stranger.
"Yes," admitted Garner, equally sur
prised,.as all but his youngest brother are
dead, and this man must have- been a
friend of his youth, as indeed ho was.
It turned out that the stranger was
Horace Harvey, a nephew of Garner, a
son of the latter's sister. The two had
not seen each other since 1851, over halt
a century ago, when Harvey, with his
mother and family, left Illinois and went
to Texas. Fourteen years later Garner
crossed the plains with an ox team, com

I think that to-day the steel company in all its
branches is intrinsically In a stronger and bet

The new president has entered on his

that with his election the steel corpora

be less centralization of power and In

various committees. President Corry will
devote his entire attention to thÂ« prac

Iron Industry, and will receive, material
aid from tho advisory committee, whose
members are especially well qualified to
art in that capacity.

BERLIN, Aug. 4â The details are pub
lished to-day of a court martial held at
Mctz on a non-commissioned officer
named Dunkel for maltreating private
jSoldiers at Moerchlngen. Five' hundred
and seventy-Fix instances of brutality, all
'occurring since last December, were cited.
The evidence showed Dunkel's fertile 'in
ventiveness in novel methods of punish
ment, such as compelling a soldier to
.run at full tilt across a room and ram
his head against a wardrobe.
The court decided that 306 counts of
.the indictment had been proved and sen
tenced" Dunkel to two years and a half
imprisonment and degradation to the
ranks.
* The scandal became known to the mili
tary authorities through the suicide of
one of the maltreated men which an
anonymous letter ascribed to Dunkel's
brutality.

A prolonged session of the striking tele

coast conference committee was held last
night, at which every phase of the situa

mood President John I. Sabln manifested
when speaking with the Mayor over a
possible agreement between himself and
the union was considered as an opening
wedge to a final adjustment between the
two bodies.
It is recognized that the local union of
linemen cannot alone adjust the differ

telephone company and Its employes takes
In the entire coast and must be settled
on a much broader basis than If it was
a purely local fight.
Whatever- agreement is reached by the

SANTA ROSA, Aug._JLâ The life was
crushed out of Henry Yandex Straten at
Fulton- late last evening: by some freight
cars on the California Northwestern rail
road. He lingered for several hours be
fore death came to. his relief. He was sec
tion foreman at Fulton, and was engaged
in the performance of his duty at the
time of the accident. The first his com
panions knew, of .the accident was when
they saw the urif6rtunate man "beneath
the wheels and. being rolled along the
ground. '
After receiving his Injuries he called one
of. his men" to him, delegated his autho
rity,'and directed how the work in hand
should proceed. He was brought here on
a special train, and .reported his action in
placing one of his men In charge of his
gang to Division Superintendent J. W.
Barrows. One of hl3 limbs was amputated
before his death, but his condition would
not permit the amputation of the other.
One of the distressing incidents connect
ed with the death of the young man was
the fact that In a couple of weeks he was
to have wedded Miss Hixon of Pieta. He
had been connected with the railroad six
years.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Less than half an hour before the rob
bery was committed the manager had
left the house for the night and had
transferred $1500 in gold from the faro
table to the safe. The robbery had evi
dently been carefully planned and the
thief was familiar with the house, for
he was evidently aware that Gibson did
not have a gun in the drawer of his
table. The man \ at the roulette table
had a six-shooter, and together with" the
barkeeper sent a bullet after the robber.
Half a dozen men were standing at
the bar not twenty feet away. When
Gibson gave the alarm the robber was
leaving by the back door. The bar
keeper rushed for his gun and pursued
the fleeing man, firing three shots, but
none took effect, and the robber escaped.
The officers have not the slightest
clew.
* The Cabinet Club is located on the
main corner of Tucson, not half a block
from the postofflce. Dick Gibson was
dealing at the faro bank and his look
out was standing with his back turned
talking to the dealer at the roulette
wheel when the thief entered by thÂ«
back door. He walked direct to the
faro bank, where no one happened to be
playing at the time, drew his revolver
and had Gibson covered and the money
in his pockets before the latter had re
covered from his surprise. In his haste
to get away he dropped a $5 gold piece
on the floor.
TUCSOX, Ariz.. Aug. 4. â A masked
robber entered the Cabinet Club gam
bling hall at 3 o'clock this morning,
placed a six-shooter against the fore

deed was done so quickly that the thief
had departed by the back door before
the men who were in the hall at the time
knew that the robbery had been com

DRYTOWN, Amador County, Aug.
j 4.â The trained mountaineers of
' Amador County have at last Bet
out upon the trail of the escaped
convicts. It has been decided
that the chase shall continue un
til tlio lives of the outlaws are ended, for
It wllf be a battle to death. The moun
taineers are determined to win success.
To-night Sheriff T. K. Norman and fif
teen followers are taking a course in the
direction of Fair Play. To-morrow they
will take the scent of the quarry on the
middle fork of the Cosumnes River.
Plymouth to-day presented a martial
appearance. Mounted men with guns
were ridlr/g through the streets. Great
supplies of provisions wero being packed
In bags and boxes by women, while men
were cleaning' rifles and examining car
tridges. Withal there was a feeling of
expectancy pervading the whole town.
Just before nightfall Norman and six fol-
Ibwers arrived from Jackson. Four men
from Plymouth joined them Immediately.
As the detachment departed after sup
per five half-breed trailers dropped into
the company.
Fred Jackson Is chief counselor of the
Sheriff. He walks with a limp, which has
been his portion since the historic battle
of Stone Corral when John Sontag went
his way to death. It was Jackson, too,
who fired the fatal bullet: Jackson . has
few words to say. He thinks his work is
only a matter of Interest to others. Af
ter much persuasion he said to-night:
"We are surely going after outlaws and
will stay with It. It makes no difference
if it lasts a week, a month or a year. I
shall do . my best to wipe the scoundrels
from the face of the earth. ' I have" no
fear of being ambushed.. .No experienced
mountaineer will' get Into any such trou
ble as that. I have been. trailing men all
my life and do not dislike it. I have
caught some and lost others. , There is no
telling from the start what will happen,
and thev may get me this time. It will
be all right, anyway. .
"The last man-hunting I did was after
a stage robber, two months" ago, and I
did not uet him. It" might bo the same
way this time, but I do not think we will
miss all of the rascals. ., We will Interest
them some, at least, before the wlnd.-up.

however, so you can wait until then and
perhaps I will have something to tell
you." t
Sheriff Norman is a little fellow with a
grizzly mustache and piercing eyes. He
looks as wlfy as an acrobat. In speak
ing of the prospective hunt he said:
"We are In this thing to the finish. 1
do not care where we wind up. I know
the mountains like a book. We have not
yet marked out our campaign. "We will
have to be guided by circumstances. You
can say that the whole crowd Is com
posed of experienced .trailers who arc
stickers as well. Nothing like that am
bush of National Guardsmen at the Grand
Victory mine will happen to us.' We go
at it in a different way. I am not tak
ing out these boys to have them slaugh
tered. Some of the men travel On horses,
some go afoot. I may possibly divide the
detachment further on. Reinforcements
will follow us from day' to day, as many
men we want are not able to go at pres
ent.
A. GIgnac, G. M. Wyatt and T. P. Col
bin, who started from Placerville last
night, are to' endeavor to drive the con
victs to the posse. Norman and his men
will try both to head off theÂ» fugitives and
to overtake them, as need may be. The
course will be to-night to a -point six
miles above Oleta.- After that no- plans
have been made except to catch the con
victs. A courier on horseback will be sent
to Plymouth or Jackson daily if practi
cable, but whenever anything interesting
happens in any case. Sheriff .Bosqult of
El Dorado County will be apprised of the
progress of campaign and will send as
sistance if necessary.
It Is now believed that the convicts will
make for the Blue j Lake region. Norman
and . his men also expect to get to Slip
pery Rock at Red Lake grade on the
summit of the Sierras. The Sheriff and
Jackson will have i with them, besides
half-breeds, E. J. Bonestell of Butter
Creek, "W. R. Covert of Amador, ,T. . M.
Danelson. Robert ' M. Carroll. Otto Pack
ard and Julius Fragulla of Plymouth, P.
W.Paller of lone and Lawrence Whfte of
Amador. ' Â¦Â¦:Â¦".'Â»<'
It is generally believed that â¢ the five
convicts whom Norman and his men are
pursuing axe Miller, Murphy, Theron,
Howard and "Woods. Old man Easty.
whose cabin near Copper Lead on the
Cosumnes Rives, was ; robbed Sunday
night, identified the photographs of the
first four named , above as those of his
visitors. Woods was known to have pos
sessed: opera glasses which 1 were dropped
on the hill near Grand Victory mine.
Silent, Strong Men of Amador's Mountain Region Assemble for a
Campaign That Promises Battles.
Another fatal mistake was made when
the convicts were located at Pilot Hill
the evening they escaped from Folsom.
It was known that they had mixed up
ammunition. One clear head to direct af
fairs and it would have been possible to
have drawn the fire of the convicts until
their useful ammunition Was exhausted.
Surrender or death must have then been
Inevitable.
Now that the Sheriffs see the errors
that have been made definite plans and
co-operation are being: carried oiy It looks
now as If the chances of some of the con
victs escaping death are becoming slim.
Sheriff Reese of Sacramento, Sheriff
Jones of Madera and Sheriff Stbley of
San Joaquln arrived here this evening
and will consult with Sheriff Bosqult as
to the best concerted plans to aid the
posses now in the field.
The various Sheriffs and posses were
Instructed to go to certain quarters by
Clerk Brainerd Smith of Folsom prison,
who continuously issued orders by tele
phone from the prison. Now that the
Sheriffs have had time to think over the
situation they see the absurdity of ever
having accepted orders from Clerk
Smith. Smith is an excellent bookkeeper
and penman, but his physical disability
has prevented him from being* able to
ever go through the country, and his
knowledge of It is absolutely nil.
It is the general opinion of the Sheriffs
and the members of the posses with
whom a Call correspondent has talked
in the past few days that If the militia
company from Placerville and all the
posses had been ordered to scour the Im
mediate territory around Folsom. prison
and then worked to a common center the
convicts would long ago have been wiped
out of existence.
MISTAKES AT START.
The increase of the reward for each of
the convicts to $500 has been hailed with
satisfaction here. The general opinion
among the law officers Is that an error
was made In not placing the hunt for
convicts in, the hands of some one ex
perienced person.
the two convicts. The posses working
from each direction are heading for head
quarters, which are situated north of Pil
ot Creek and below the south fork of the
middle fork of the American River.
" MARYSVILLE, Aug. 4. â The ques
tion pow is if at least two of the Fol-
. s j?om escapes may not be hiding some
where in this locality. "When the north
abound Oregon express passed Rosevllle
Junction this morning two suspicious
[characters boarded the train. One of
the â¢ men answered the description of
Kay Fahey. a life-termer, and the con
ductor telegraphed to the authorities
here to be at the depot when the train
arriv6d prepared to meet the suspicious
looking passengers.
Five police officers met the train
when It rolled In at 2 a. m.. and â¢ were
Informed by the train crew that the
men had got off at Lincoln, twenty miles
south of here. The conductor was
shown pictures of the escaped convicts
and. immediately picked out Fahey as
being that of one of the men. The brake
man was not certain, but believed that
the other man was "Red Shirt" Gordon.
Conductor Notifies Marysville Police,
.tut Supposed. Convicts Escape.
SUSPECTS ON A TRAIN.
Two of the convicts are known to be
northeast of Placerville, between Mos
quito and Soapweed. Their trail was tak
en up some days ago and was followed
by ex-Constable Bob Moherter of George
town. These two convicts were the ones
reported early last week to have been
seen near Greenwood. They have un
doubtedly been working east from Green
wood, with the intention of heading for
the road that leads across the county to
Lake Tahoe, near McKlnneys.
In a quiet manner, the . trial of the
outlaws has been followed by Sheriff
Mansfield of San Mateo County, and ex-
Sheriff Conroy of Placer County. Con-
PTTHSUIT FROM GREENWOOD.
From the location where the convicts
were last seen they must take the North
Fork or the Middle Fork of the Cosumnes
RJver. as if they work up the other forks
of the river they will be unable to go
ahead on account of the waterfalls and
heavy drops of the ravines.
Sheriff Norman of Amador County left
Jackson to-day and with fifteen heavily
armed deputies proceeded to Plymouth.
At Plymouth he will divide his forces and

After the service in the church the coffin
was again placed on the gun carriage and
the procession re-formed and marched
to Union Cemetery. Sad indeed was tho
final scene there and tears coursed down
the faces of the men who had fought side
by side with Rutherford on the fatal
manzanita hill last Saturday afternoon.
Many women were overcome by emotion
aj the last words of the funeral service
were uttered by the pastor and the cas
ket was lowered.
The firing squad advanced and at the
command of Captain Swlsler three volleys
were fired over the grave. Bugler "Wal
ters sounded "taps." As all stood with
bowed heads, the mournful sounds of the
bugle were caught up by the surrounding
hills and were echoed far and wide.
To a lively quickstep the militia re
turned to . town and the mourners and
friends of Rutherford sadly wended their
way home, to reassemble in the after
noon and pay their last honors to the
comrade of the' man who was to be buried
In the afternoon. The scenes witnessed at
the burial of Rutherford In the morrlng
were repeated when Jones was buried.
Every honor was given to the memory
of the brave fellow who had fought
through many battles in the Philippines,
only to find an awful death in this peace
ful community at the hands of the out
laws who broke from Folsom prison. As
the sun was sinking behind the hills the
sound of the volleys from the guns of
the firing squad told of the last tragic
chapter In the ' life of Jones. Though
there was no one of kith and kin to take
part In the final rites given bis remains,
there was no lack of tender love and sym
pathy. The men and women of Placer
ville did all In their power to give honor
to Jones In placing his body in the quiet
cemetery. A handsome monument will be
placed by the citizens of Placervlllle to
mark the resting place of the two young
heroes.
This morning the body of Rutherford,
which had lain all night in his parents*
home at Missouri Flat, was brought 'into
Placervilla. The hearse was followed by
carriages bearing the relatives of tho
dead man and their grief was pitiful to
behold. On â¢ arriving at the lower end
of the town the hearse was met by thÂ©
members of Company H, under command
of Captain Swlsler. The coffin was re
moved from the hearse and placed upon
the carriage' of a six-pounder 'field -gun
and it was draped by an American flag.
On the top of the coffin rested the uni
form, cap and the medals won. In shoot-

At the sound of the bugle, the military
cortege began its march through the
town. Ahead, the military band played
a dirge, then came the members of tho
militia, marching four abreast. The gun.
carriage bearing the flag-draped casket
was drawn by long ropes handled by
twenty friends of the dead man. On each
side of the coffin walked the pallbearers,
who were members of the military com
pany. They were John Harris, Oscar

The body of Rutherford . was burled

given burial, this afternoon. The funeral
services took place In the Methodist Epis

Rev. George C. King, the pastor. A sad
feature of the burial of Jones was the
absence of any relatives. The young man

Effectively framed either in

Cardinal Oreglia, as dean of the Cardi
nal bishops, called Cardinals Netto and
Macchi, the deans respectively of the Car
dinal priests and Cardinal deacons. They
approached the new Pontiff, saying in
Latin, distinctively but in a shaking
voice:
"Sarto," "Sarto," ran from mouth to

none seemed to know what to do, it be

amid visible excitement, tha eager faces
of the conclavists and prelates being seen
crowding about the door.
It is Impossible to describe the confu
sion in* the chapel. The friends and sup
porters of the new. Pope gathered around
him. complimenting and congratulating,
crying "Viva!"' and even clapping their
hands without ceremony. They appeared
to be unable to contain their joy.
The new Pope is one of eight children
two sons and .six daughters. . One of his
sisters is a dressmaker, another is mar
ried to a sacristan, a third is married to
a wine shop keeper and the others are
unmarried. The new Pope is the seventh
who has come from the region of Venice.
Among the Venetian Popes was Benedict
XII, who by . a . coincidence was . elected
Pope exactly 559 years ago to-day.
Regarding the veto power supposed to
be vested in Austria, Spain and Italy, this
Cardinal said that no attempt had been
made to exercise such a power and that
the Sacred College was greatly divided as
to the continuance of that tradition. A
Venetian might be objectionable to Aus
tria, but, the Cardinal said, he failed to
see why that should be so because the
ancient enmity between Venice and Aus
tria was confined to a small section of the
Italian 'people. Besides, Austria was
Italy's ally and there should be no mis
givings regarding the future "course of

He seems, however, to have a charmlnp per

of most of the members of the Sacred College,
who, being residents of Italy and' thereabouts,
are fully able to Judire. I am told he is de
voted to Venice and has frequently said that ho
could never be happy elsewhere. Poor man!

The dispute is over the new agreement

SALT LAKE, Aug. 4.â "The Roman

Naturally this does not mean that Sarto.
once Pope, will fundamentally change the
policy that the church has adopted to
ward the Vatican stated but certainly his
personal ' feelings will be favorable to

"Sarto" in Italian means "tailor," and

rather elegant in his priestly robes, hjs
companlons/'used to joke, saying that he
evidently knew the business.
FAVOBITE OF THE KING.
He has very modest tastes, having re
tained almost the same habits as when
he was a . mere curate at Salzano. He
was severe but just with his clergy. There
ia nothing he dislikes so much as pub
licity, detesting the praise and compli
ments of courtiers. Frankness is another
of his principal qualities, although he ia
somewhat timid.
As the Italians say, he has no harm on
his tongue or pen. Even so, Pius X often
wrote truths which were^ perhaps un
pleasant
He used then to say that he dfd not like
to go out of eight of the lions of St.
Mark, which now he will never see again,
if. as is almost sure, he follows the rule
inaugurated by his two predecessors,
never to leave the Vatican.
In a few cases in which he came to
Rome, on returning when asked If he en
joyed thp gorgeousnesa of the Papal* court
and the magnificence of the functions,
Sarto answered: ""When I am there I feel
like a fish out of water."
The relations of Sarto with the House
of Savoy are well illustrated by what
occurred two months ago, when the King
of Italy went to Venice to open the In
ternational art exhibition. King Victor
Emmanuel grave orders that the patri
arch be given precedence over.' all the
local authorities, but Sarto, having ar
rived, while the King was speaking to the
prefect, who is the highest Government
official . in the .province, refused to be
announced, and said he would not disturb
his Majesty.
Sarto became the Idol of the Venetians.
"When his gnndola went through the
canals the people rushed on the bridges
and. along the sides of the canals, kneel
ing and saluting, the women exclaiming:
"God bless the patriarch."
- Hi3- preferment to the Venetian patri
archate'was the solution of a very trou
blesome question. The Italian Govern
ment maintained that the presentation of
|the : candidate for the office was one, ol
'the prerogatives of the King as helr^to
the .ancient privileges granted by the
Pope to the republic of Venice. Sarto's
selection ended the contention, for though
chosen by the Pope he was a great fa
vorite with King Humbert himself and
entirely acceptable to his Ministers. So
the exaquatur, which, had been long with
held, was granted to him. The Italian
Cabinet had no feeling against Sarto per
sonally. In- fact, Â¦ he' might quite, well
have been their choice if the papacy had
not wished him, but it was a political
question on which, however, they soon
gave way.
In Venice he distinguished himself as
a thorough reformer, suppressing ail
abuses, restoring the dignity of the cler
gy and the earnestness of religion. To
him is due . the revival of a Gregorian
chant in the beautiful churches overlook-
Ing the lagoons, and to him is- due the
strict Hturgic rules.
IDOL OP THE VENETIANS.
Venice alone of all the important cities
of Italy has only patriarchal rank, while
many smaller cities are archiepiscopal
seats. The acceptance of the more hum
ble office, however, cost him but a little
patience, for on June 12, 1893, after some
two years' service as patriarch, he was
created and proclaimed Cardinal. He has
for his titular church In Rome St. Bar
nardo.
Greater preferment awaited him, how
ever. Pope Leo, who had highly appre
ciated his cleverness, piety and modesty,
appointed him in November, 1SS4, at the
age of 49 years, Bishop of Mantua, where
he remained until he was elected to the
patriarchate of Venice.
In 1875 ha was elected chancellor of the
bishopric of Treviso, then spiritual direc
tor of that seminary, judge of the ecclesi
astical tribunal, and finally vicar general.
HIS PIETY APPRECIATED.
In 1867 he was appointed parish priest
at Salzano, which was considered an im
portant promotion, being a village of 3341
souls. Still, he was exceedingly sorry to
leave Tombolo. having become attached
to the people. The peasants, when he left,
made a most enthusiastic demonstration;
crying "Viva Don Giuseppe," while many
women whose children he had nursed
wept copiously. He distinguished himself
so much at Salzano that he was kept
there only two years, which is remarka
ble in the career of an Italian parish
priest.' His talents attracted the atten
tion of the Bishop of Trevlso, who ap
pointed him canon of the cathedral of
that diocesan city. /

when he was called in the middle of a

to be nothing of the kind. He gave freely

THE history of the Papacy in the earlier centuries of the church is preserved altogether in the ecclesiasti
cal records of the Vatican, and there are no secular authorities on ; the subject. For many V years it was
contended by certain Biblical scholars that St. Peter's^.yisit to Rome was largely legendary, but more re
cently the best authorities, are at one in the opinion that the visit ia perfectly historical, and that Peter
idied at Rome in much the same way as the legends recite. Counting St. Peter as the first Pope, or rather as
the first Bishop of Rome, there have been, from Peter to Pius X inclusive, 264 sovereign Pontiffs of Rome, the
reigns of whom vary in length from a few days to the long and glorious reigns of men like Gregory XVI, Pius
IX and Leo XIII. A comparatively small number, of the .Popes have been canonized, and these are chiefly the
earlier ones. No saint has 'sat- on the throne of Peter since: 1566." when Pius V ruled'. The question of canoniz
ing the late Pope Pius IX has been long, discussed, but although the conditions seem favorable â in the way of
extreme sanctity, with accompanying miracles and so ohâ it may. be centuries before the church will take positive
action. The following is a complete list' of all the Popes of Rome from Peter to Pius X. The months and years
given here .will' be found to be inconsistent with- accepted dates, bu^ the difference is due solely to the variation
in the calendar. The list is from Gams arid is entitled "Series Episcoporum Romanae Ecclesiae," which is ac
cepted by the Roman Catholic church as being correct, and is recorded in the registers of the Vatican:

CARDINAL SARTO'S ELEVATION TO PETER'S THRONE
THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 5, 1903.
ROME, Aug. 4.â Soon after the conclave
.was dissolved one of the Cardinals who
had returned to his house in Rome said:
We. really were very well treated and, I feel
better than when I went Into the conclave. The
perfect rest wag a treat. We had good food
and the arrangements for looking after so many
persons could not have been better. After mass
every moraine we entered the Blstlne Chapel
and transacted our business. I can understand
that those ' outside grew impatient, but I
scarcely think we could have been' expected 'to
decide so weighty a matter by such a lengthy
method of procedure within a shorter time.
No doubt the appearance of the smoke waa
Irritating to those who looked for a speedy
conclusion, although, personally, I am sur
prised to know that the smoke was seen at all.
Looking Into the little stove in the Slstlne
Chapel and seeing the diminutive heap that thn
ballots made, one could scarcely think that they
would form, when burned, a cioud aa big as a
man's hartd. To-day, of course, there was no
smoke, as. all of the ballots were sealed Â¦ for
preservation. j
After each morning's session we had dinner.
During ' the afternoon - moat or us - spent â¢ our
time reading in our rooms, I varied my liter
ature with several . American periodicals and
.learned treatises on the conclave. All of these

INCIDENTS OF CONCLAVE.
Curdinal Gibbons,, speaking to a rep
resentative of the press, said that the
election of Cardinal Sarto had produced
the best Impression in the entire Sacred
College, because, being a man of . such
piety, tact and culture, he was best fitted
to be the head of the church at the pres
ent time. Gibbons . hopes that
the coronation of Piux X will take place
soon, so that the foreign Cardinals may
be able to assist. Others believe that the
coronation may bo â¢ postponed for three
months, to a more propitious time.
There he paused,- but the Cardinals
around him insisted that It was necessary
for him to answer "yes" or "no."
Thereupon he replied firmlv, "Yes."
Â¦"If this cup cannot pass from meâ" â¢
But from many sides Cardinals cried
out: "Continue." As the vote approached
fifty, however, the Cardinals, as of one
accord, surrounded the new Pontiff, and,
according to tradition, demanded to know
if he would accept the Pontificate.
Cardinal Sarto's lips trembled so that
he could hardly articulate, but after a
visible effort he said:
had to be revived by thÂ« use of salts.
He seemed happy but broken down even
after all the other candidates had re
tired and on the final ballot he looked a
statue of resignation. Cardinal Casseta,
as scrutineer, was reading out the vote.
When forty-two votes had been recorded
for the patriarch of Venice the scrutineer
arose and lifted his red zucchetto, saying:
"We have elected a Pontiff." â¢
When he pronounced his first benedic
tion to-day at St. Peter's his voice rang
out with splendid resonance. In every
Â¦wax. to-day ** e showed beyond a doubt
that he had dignity and personality in
keeping with the best traditions associ
ated with the famous Pontiffs who for
centuries hare ruled the Vatican.
All the members of the Sacred . College
declare that they are well satisfied with
the election of Cardinal Sarto, but. the
party opposed to Rampolla believe that It
is their epedal victory.
When the first ballot was taken it
f howtd that the Sacred College was di
vided Into two groups, the stronger one
tor Rampolla and the lesser one for Sera
nno Vannutelli. The other votes were
ecattered, but included four for Sarto.
On the subsequent ballots, while the
principal two parties were losing ground,
Sarto gradually gained, drawing strength
from both ends and ( the middle, until the
ballot .on Monday.; afternoon, .when his
vote had Increased to thirty-sevenâ within
six of the necessary two-thirds.
When the result of this ballot was arf
nounced in the conclave Cardinal Sarto
was so overcome with emotion and so
touched by the unlooked for confidence
reposed in him that he could no longer
control his feelings and to the surprise
of all he broke down, declaring that such
responsibility and honor were not for
him and that he must refuse It, if elected.
Tears rolled down, his cheeks and he
peemed firm in his determination to refuse
the dignity. He was so palpably sincere
that consternation reigned in the con
clave and the Cardinals spent the' whole
evening and much of the night in con
vincing him that his election was the will
of providence and that he must accept
Several times he^ almost fainted and

It agrees with La Patrla's opinion that
the relations of the church and state will
not chance.
The Trlbuna says:
.The election cannot be considered to be the
result of an agreement between the two oppoe
inK factions, though Cardinal Ram polla's fol
lower! are probably more pleased than those of
Cardinal Vannutelll. . .
The Patriarch, of Venice represents what
might he flpfined an a skillful, though reason
able, intransigreance.
The majority declare and we believe that he
Is a man of lofty intellect, vast knowledge and
exemplary piety â so much the better. In any
ease, it Is sure he will not Introduce any sub
stantial Innovation In the relations of the
church and elate and will not import, any
change In the Vatican. He will continue to
remain shut up. a willing prisoner himself, in
the roya: dungeon of the Apostolic Palace.
ROME, Aug. 4.â La Patria, commenting
on the election of Sarto, says: $

CHICAGO, Aug. 4.â General satisfaction
was manifested by the Chicago Catho
lics to-day over the selection of the new
Pope. The most ardent champions of
the Idea. of Americanism in the church
agree that the choice was a. â¢wise one.
Archbishop Quigley, who is a personal
friend of Pius X, directed that services
of thanksgiving be held in every church
to-night.
During Archbishop Farley's visit abroad
a year ago Cardinal Sarto asked a great
many Questions about the church in
America and seemed very much Inter
ested in this country.
CHICAGO*,. Aug. 4.â Archbishop Farley
when Informed of the election of Cardinal
Sarto said:
I am delighted that the conclave's choice has
fallen on eo acceptable a person as Cardinal
Sarto. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
So far as known. Cardinal Sarto, now elected
Pop<\ is a man of deep learning; and reccgnlzed
prudence of action. He enters into tjie pon
tificate free from all entangling alliances, free
in every way to carve out for himself hi a own
career.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Aug. 4. -Archbishop
Ireland in speaking of the new Pope said:
See in the Patriarch a Worthy Suc
cessor of. Leo XIII.
TRIBUTES OF. PRELATES.
In other quarters it was reftnarked that
Sarto was the only Italian Cardinal whom
the King of Italy, received. His repeated
visits' to the King and his aversion to pol
itics are regarded as an auspicious sign
for the triple alliance. Germany is also
fully satisfied that Sarto does not aspire
to the restoration of the temporal power
of the papacy. The officials believe that
the German Emperor will b'e well pleased
with the election. It is said that the Em^
peror received Sarto in audience while'
visiting the King of Italy.
All sections of the press regard the
election of Cardinal Sarto as wise, and
emphasize .the belief that he will be a
religious, rather than a political, Pope.
The Tageblatt fears that the selection
of the name of Pius augurB 111 for the
nr-w Pope's attitude^toward foreign gov
ernments, and Indicates an intransigeant
policy toward the. Italian monarchy.
The Post assumes that Sarto's previous
moderate and peaceable character may be
taken as a guarantee that the coming
policy of the Vatican will be , temperate
and conciliatory.
BERLIN, Aug. 4.â A . dispatch to the
Lokal Anzelger from Rome asserts that
Cardinal Gibbons played the chief: part
in frustrating the election of 'Cardinal
Rampolla. <
The election of Cardinal Sarto was
made known here at 1 o'clock this after
r.oon through the newspapers, which were
eagerly read. The Foreign Office at that
hour had no confirmation of the news,
but regarded it as true, it having been
learned that Cardinal Sarto had strongly
increased his vote yesterday. Replying
to the question whether the election was
acceptable to Germany, a representative
of the Foreign Office said:
Unqualifiedly so, from an official viewpoint.
Barto is a mild mannered man and has never

at the Result
GEEMANS WELL PLEASEDi
Surprise in Patriarch's Home.
VIENNA. Aug. 4.â The election of Car
dinal Sarto as Pope has occasioned . some
surprise here,- his name scarcely having
been mentioned among the possible suc
cessors of Pope Leo. In official circles
satisfaction and even pleasure Is ex
pressed at the result of the conclave.
CARDINALS ARE PLEASED.
LONDON, Aug. 5.â It is difficult to find
in London arfy member of the Catholic
church having personal knowledge of the
new Pope, Pius X, or one who ia willing
to give an opinion as to the Pontiff's
-probable policy. All. however, have high
opinions as to his merits, particularly as
If is known that a few years ago Pope
Leo favored Cardinal Sarto as his suc
cessor. The general belief Is that Pius
Jc will endeavor to increase the power of
the church rather as a spiritual than a
diplomatic organisation, and that his
feign will pave the way for better rela
tions between the Vatican and the Quir-
Inal. On this point, however, it Is be
lieved that & better idea can be formed
trben it is seen who the Pontiff chooses
fdr papal secretary of state. If Cardinal
Rampolla Is retained it will be taken as
en 111 omen.
Father Gasquet, Abbot of the English
* Benedictines, in an interview said the
English Catholics would welcome any
modus vlvendl with the Quirinal, because
the existing state of things was bad for
jt -very body. He thinks the present Pope |
is better able than any man who could
have been chosen to bring about Improv
ed conditions. , -
News of the election of Cardinal Sarto
as Pope reached England through an As
sociated Press dispatch from New York.
The information was communicated to
the Catholic church authorities, and Mon
uignor Johnson, who is in charge of
church affairs here, pending the appoint
ment of a Successor to Cardinal Vaughan,
said:
I am Els'! the election 1* over anÂ«l the sua
penee ended. Cardinal Sarto is . midway foe
tvvten the older and younger element of the Sa
cred Colleee, eo that he probably has many use
ful years to live. He li active and energetic.
To the Catholics of London the' election
v as a great surprise. The London papers
publish long and friendly reviews of the
new Pope'e career. They generally believe
that the election augurs well for better
relations between the Vatican and the
QUirinal. Stress Is laid on Cardinal Sar
to'* attitude when the King and Queen of
of Church's Power.
British- Catholics Look for Increase
EXPECT UBEBAL POLICY.
Â¦ PARIS. Aug. 4.â Monsignor Boeglin, a
pVominent ecclesiastical writer, has a
lengthy article in the Temps to-night on
.the political meaning of Cardinal Sarto's
election. He declares that it means that
the policy of Pope Leo will be continued.
Next to Rampolla, Sarto was the obvious
Fucceesor. he completing the edifice that
Leo 'began.
The writer asserts that the result of
the conclave indicates the complete col
lapse of the coalition of Austrian, Eng
lish, German and American Cardinals,
which aimed at the supremacy of the An
glo-Saxon-German races in the direction
of the Catholic Church and at the over
throw of the French policy of the papacy.
He makes sarcastic allusions to Cardinal
Gibbons taking part in this European
ctialltion in favor of reaction, and de
clares that Pope Leo foresaw this coali
"tion and. consequently strengthened the
Italian element in the Sacred College in
order to defeat it."
In conclusion, Monsignor Boeglin says
the defeat of the anti-French coalition is
most auspicious both for the republic and
church, which haye every reason to be
satisfied with the result of the conclave.
FRENCH WBITEIL'S VIEWS
Sees in Sarto's Election a Triumph
for Paris Government.
A leading official of the foreign office
who recently visited Venice said that the
cordial relations between Sarto and Dow
arer Queen Margherlta were particularly
noted by him. The Queen bestowed many
marks of favor, which he received with
out the slightest evidence of that tension
listing In other clerical quarters.
â¢ Outside of Government quarters, Sar
to's election is favorably received. The
leading exponents of the clerical element
point out his saintllness and declare that
iiis choice gives promise of a religious
rather than a diplomatic Pope. The
nuntlo here was advised of the election
end paid a tribute to the lofty charac
ter of the new Pope. Public interest in
the election was shown by the issue of
special editions of the' papers, which de
vote elaborate articles to the new Pope.
The current sentiment is entirely fav
orable to Plus X.
An official letter was received this
morning from Rome giving the prospects
of the various candidates. It placed
Raxnpolla first and Sarto eighth. Between
these two ranged Seranno VannuteUl,
Gottl, Agliardl. Dl Pietro and Capecelatro.
Although it is not known definitely how
the French Cardinals voted on the final
ballot, it Is known that they, with tha
Spanish Cardinals, favored the selection
of one of those considered to be con
ciliatory, which number included Sarto.

Jng of satisfaction which the choice of
Sarro has caused In Government circle*.
The foreign office had not received ad
vices from M. Nlsartl. the French Em
b&ssador to the Vatican, up to a late
hour this afternoon, but. relying on re
ports from other souroes, a notification
was sent to M. Delcasse, who ia sojourn
ing at a watering place in the interior
â¢f France, and to President Loubet, who
is at the Chateau Mazeno, near Monteli
mar, which he recently purchase^. Re
plies from the President and the Foreign
Minister soon followed and were trans
mitted through the foreign office to Rome.

The Standard, on the other hand, fears
that the new Pope sympathizes with and
to a large extent will be guided by Ram
polla's ideas, but admits that if he is
as tactful and conciliatory as his friends
represent there is no need to apprehend
any violent reversal of policy.
The â¢ Telegraph considers the choice ' of
the title of Pius X as strange, whVm the
character and career of â¢ the . last bearer
of the name of Pius are remembered. <â¢
LOJifDON. Aug. 5.â The papers this
morning comment on the . conclave's
choico as a wise and excellent one, and
say that, although the new Pope is less
brilliant as a scholar than his predeces
sor, there will be ample compensation for
this in his moderation, and single mind
edness on the Question Â¦ of the relations
of the Vatican to. England. Opinions;
however, differ. The Daily New* says:
We are at least preÂ»wed from questionable
lntrijHK-s of a RampoUa who Is not too friendly
to England,
Italy visited Venice last May and Sarto
went In state in his gorgeous gondola to
render them homage. It is deduced there
from that Plus X is likely to depart from
Pope Leo's policy of rigorous confinement
in the Vatican. , , , '.

LOXDON. Aug. 4.â While the House of
Commons was in committee on the sugar
coxn'ention bill to-day a long discussion
r'rose as to whether the Importation of
bounty-fed 6Ugar should be prohibited or
countervailing duties should be Imposed.
Many of the Liberal members referred to
the American imports, which, although
now insignificant, might increase If the
price of eugar rose. It was pointed out
that the prohibition of sugar from the
United States would be a violation of the
most favored nation clause and stress
was laid by the opposition on the same
question as it might affect Argentina.
Gerald Balfour, president of the Board

that if St **emed llkrly that a large sup-
My would be cut off by the prohibition,
the Government would consider the ad-
of applying countervailing du-

' Among , the seething mass below,
which never ceased waving hats, two

aloft American flags. These swayed
brightly around the nave as the bearers

PROCLAIMS SARTO PONTIFF.
Slowly Cardinal Maorhi, Secretary of
the Congregation of Apostolic Briefs, ad
vanced and exclaimed in a loud voice:
"I announce to you with great pleasure
that we have elected as Pope the Most
Eminent Reverend Cardinal Joseph Sarto,
who has taken the name of Plus X."
Then the bells of St. Peter's boomed
out, as did those of all the churches of
Rome, giving the glad news to tha world.
As Cardinal Macchi returned to the
Sistlne Chapel, after having performed
his pious duty, the new Pope arose and
an effort to form some kind of a proces
sion was made, but Pius X was literally
carried In triumph to his cell, followed
by a great concourse and preceded by tho
cross. He was stopped every step or two
by those anxious to kiss his ring and re
ceive the papal blessing, which Sarto ao
corded with great dignity and patience.
As the new Pope passed along many of
those present tried to prove that they had
always known what the result would be
and how satisfied they all were.
"Why, of course," shouted one, "before
the conclave gathered I always said it
would be he."
If any of these compliments reached the
ears of the Pontiff he gave no sign there
of. When he arrived at the door of his
cell the Pope turned, and. raising his
bands, gave in a voice almost suffocated
with emotion his benediction to the as
sembly, which received it on bended
knees.
After a short rest. Imposed by the
fatigue and emotion of his election, Pius
X joined his court in the Ducal Hall for
the solemn benediction which he was
about to give to the people of Rome.
Although to ordinary eyes the confusion
was as great as ever, to those practiced
In the mysteries of the Vatican order
was coming out of chaos, and the bear
ing of all in the presence of the : Pope
was much more formal. The babel of
voices sank at his approach, while none
addressed him unless he spoke first.
PROCESSION TO ST. PETER'S.
The formal salutations having termin
ated, a procession was formed. In the
center was the Pontiff, In his white
robes, his figure standing out above those
surrounding him, his silver hair gleam-
Ing under his white cap. He was sur
rounded by the Cardinals, still . In their
violet robes, and preceded by the pontifi
cal cross, the jewels of which flashed as
though they, also -triumphed in Sarto's
succession. i!'v.-;. : -~-
The procession traversed many noble
halls until it approached the window
looking into St. Peter's. From below arose
a murmur of voices, which, although sub
dued, because distant, denoted the. pres-r
ence of a large concourse of people. Tho
Pope was seen to grow pale, and then,
turning to Cardinal Bacllirl, who stood
beside him, he said:.
Now I understand tha emotion Pope Leo
always showed when going- Into St. Peter's to
have the eyes of a great crowd focused upon
him. It is almost terrifying.
Standing forward In the window, the
others having fallen back, he deliberate
ly controlled himself and looked , across
the great basilica. Crossing himself. Sar
to raised his hand and in a voice palpably
tremulous, he said, as soon as the cries
from below gave an opportunity:
"Hear us, in the name of the Master."
To this came in reply from thousands
of voices the cry: "Who made heaven
and earth!" â¢
In a thrilling voice the Pope responded:
"May the name of the Master be
blessed."
Then, raising himself to his full height
and leaning forward as much as possible,
he intoned:. "May the omnipotent God
bless you," which called forth such ap
plause that several minutes elapsed be
fore the Pontiff could retire. He then
drew back and turned to the Ducal HalL
At the moment of leaving the window
Pius SJ turned to Monseigneur Blslcti. who
happened to be beside him. and said:
"I shall never again feel just thÂ« same
.emotion." .
This afternoon, before opening the con
clave. Pius X repaired to tho Slstlna
Chapel. In full pontifical robes and wear-
Ing the mitre, he seated himself on tho
throne which he so little expected to oc
cupy, as he left the affairs of the patri
archlate at Venice in a certain confusion.
There on the throne he received the sec
ond obedience, or so-called "adoration"
of the sacred college, each Cardinal kiss
ing his hand and foot as a sign that ho
acknowledged the new Pope's sovereign
ty. Meantime the oration super ponti
ficem electum was recited in low tones.
Then the new Pontiff arose, and, extend
ing his hands, his powerful and magnifi
cent voice, which is much stronger than
that of the late Pope, reverberating
through the dim chapel, pronounced tha
apostolio benediction amid profound si
lence. Then the great door of the con
clave opened.
At about 5:30 o'clock Prince ChigJ, tho
marshal of the conclave, and many high
ecclesiastical and lay dignitaries went to
the Sistlne Chapel to kiss the Pope's hand
and foot. They were received with great
benignity. The commandant of the Nobla
Guard and the officials of the Swiss Pal
atine Guard also went to perform this
duty. Among these officers was Count
Camillo Peed, the brigadier general of
Noble Guards, and a nephew of tho lato
Pope. The new Pontiff received him with
special gradouaness, saying a few words
of welcome.
PopÂ© Plus then retired to his cell, whllo
the Cardinals all left the Vatican and re
turned to their respective apartments, in
Rome with a feeling of particular pleas
ure after their confinement in the same
rooms of the conclave. In his cell,
which was very small and dark, the Pon
tiff received the picket of guards on duty,
the imposing figure of the new Pope
seeming to embellish the modest sur
roundings. His pontifical robes changed
him from -a merely handsome man to a
truly stately embodiment of the Catholic
idea, the gorgeous robes adding dignity to
his person. Pope Pius' benevolent man
ner is gaining him friends from moment
to moment.
went to the cell of the sick
Cardinal Herrero. saying he wished thÂ©
first act of his pontificate to be a compli
ment to a brother laid so low. Cardinal
Herrero seemed transfigured by such
though t fulness and exclaimed: :
"Let me kiss your hand. Now I shall
die happy."
The 'Pope remained some time in thÂ«
cell, encouraging tho sick man, and said
he would pray for his recovery. Ho then
gave him the apostolic blessing.
The military bodies of the Vatican. havÂ»
assumed their full uniform and hoisted
the white and yellow Papal flag at the

Although the percentage method of stating results
is not always the most accurate, it nevertheless in
this case affords a pleasing proof of the rapidity with
( Â£> TATISTICIANS of the Department of Com-
merce, in order to make a striking showing of
' .progress and growth in our Asiatic trade, have
resorted naturally enough to the easy method of
comparing percentages. Our export trade with
China, for example, in 1893 was less than $4,000,000.
but in 1903 it was upward of $19,000,000. The fig
ures as they stand do not amount to much in the in
ternational commerce of our time, and are hardly
likely to give us pride. When, however, the perr
centage of increase during the decade is noted the
results show up in a way that seems almost like the
realization of the dreams of the most sanguine.
The Bureau of Statistics in a recent bulletin show
ing the growth of our commerce with China presents
the figures in this way: "Comparing this growth^
with that of our commerce with other parts of the
world, it may be said that our total exports to Eu
rope in 1903 aggregate a little over $1,000,000,000,
against $662,000,000 in 1893, having therefore in
creased less than 60 per cent during that period;
those to North America amount % to about $215,000,
,000, against $119,000,000 in 1893, having thus in
creased about 80 per cent; those to 'South America
aggregate about $41,000,000, against $32,000,000 in
1803, an increase of about 30 per cent; those to
Asia in 1903 aggregate about $60,000,000, against
$16,000,000 in 1893, an increase of 275 per cent.
Oceanica the total for the year is about $36,000,000,
against $11,000,000 in 1893, but the exports are not
properly comparable with those of 1893 because of the
fact that they do not include the commerce with the
Hawaiian Islands, which is considered as a part of the
domestic commerce of the United States. To Africa
the total exports for 1903 aggregate about $38,000,000,
against a little less than $6,000,000 in 1893."
It is noted in the bulletin that the figures given of
our exports to China do not represent the whole of
our exports to tnat country, as a considerable pro
portion of the goods exported to Hongkong enter
China indirectly and should be credited to our trade
with that country. Exports to Hongkong last year
aggregated in value something more than $8,000,000,
making our total exports to China and Hongkong
together about $27,090,000, as against $8,000,000 in
1893-

WE have already said that no general panic
was in sight as a result of Wall street's at
tack on the waterworks of the great} indus
trial combines. It is evident that a break in some
thing more substantial than water must come be
fore the general prosperity of the country will feel
a check. In an interview just after the cloudburst in
the street Mr. Ridgely, Comptroller of the Currency,
pointed out the solid conditions which make a gen
eral panic impossible. These conditions show that
prosperity has made vast and solid and general ad
ditions to the wealth of the people. â¢ *
In 1893 we had of money in the country $1,739,000,
000. July 1, 1903. we had $2,688,000,000, an increase
of nearly one billion in ten years. In 1892 the banks
held in cash $586,000,000. In 1902 this had grown
to $839,000,000. To show tire distribution and effect
of the wealth indicated by this increase in the money
of the country the increase in farm values may be
taken. In 1800 the value of land, improvements and
buildings was $13,279,000,000; in 1900 it was $16,674,
000,000. The value of farm implements and machin
ery in the same decade increased $267,000,000, and of
livestock $769,000,000. As farm implements and ma
chinery and livestock all belong to the land-owner
and are a part of. the rural wealth, 'we find the in
crease of that wealth in land, buildings, implements
and stock to be $4,431,000,000, and the' present total
of rural permanent wealth to be $20,513,000,000. Add
to this the value of the crops on the basis of 1900,
and the total rural wealth is $25,222,000,000. -
Every one must admit that tlie figures show that
in the distribution of the wealth of the country the
farmer hasÂ»secured his share and is Holding on to it.
The value of manufactures increased in ; one year,
ending July 1, 1903. in the sum of $1,950,000,000, and
wages increased $232,000,000. â¢
These figures are dry, as figures always are, but
they tell a story as interesting as a romance. The
effect is seen throughout the country by the most
careless observer, and there is every justification for
the most optimistic view of the future. . Another ele
ment which safeguards our financial' and industrial
stability is the rapid decrease y 1 our foVcign debt,
which is being extinguished by our foreign creditors.
Instead of needing foreign capital, our own is going
abroad for investment." ;
' On the whole,, the rain that fell out of Wall; street
was from a clear industrial and financial sky, and the
shower/ was localized.
Several Oakland boys attempted a few days ago
to steal a hive of bees. While the boys deserve a
modicum of praise for their excursion into the field
of original crime, truth compels the announcement
that the bees are still in the hive, which in no way
has been disturbed. Another record, however, has
been added to the intense individuality of Oaklanders
in everything they do.
NO PANIC IN SIGHT.
Meantime the situation in the Colombian Con
gress, so far as it can be studied from this distance,
is not encouraging. The Congress has a chance to
get $10,000,000 as a bonus, to start with and a good
big income every year from- the canal, and yet it halts
and hesitates to rattfythe treaty. The republic is in
need of money, and the troops arc demanding pay
ment. The Government is discussing the advisability
of adopting a gold basis for the currency so as to put
an end to the fluctuations that are so disturbing to
commerce and industry, and still Congress deadlocks
an enterprise which promises to provide the republic
at once with a sum of gold which to Colombian eyes
must teem very attractive indeed. Under such circum
stances it is natural a suspicion should arise that the
dominant factor*in the situation. is not apparent on
the surface, and it may be that some foreign power
is at work to beat the treaty. " '/i A '.- < %
If the champagne story be true, then we will have
the 1 paradox of an incident becoming more serious by
being proven more trifling. If- the Panama situation
is'so unstable and the government so insecure that
it may be turned over whenever champagne is opened
et military headquarters, then it is certainly impera
tive that the United States Government take cont^l
of the ifthmus before entering cpon the worjeof com
pleting the canal. Â¦ *Â¦Â¦"
That is evidently the view taken at Washington,
for one report from that city says: "The State De
partment sees in the trouble which has developed in
Panama proof of its contention to have control of
the canal strip. The provisions of the treaty which
provided for policing the strip have been criticized,
but if the caprice of a military leader is sufficient for
him to risk a revolution and dispossess civil officers
of their authority, 2nd even take them into custody,
the United States must have absolute control of the
isthmus."
DISPATCHES from Washington are to the
effect that both the officials of the State De
partment and Dr. Herron, the representative
cf Colombian affairs in this country, are of the,
opinion that the recent disturbances in. Panama are
more likely to hasten than to retard the ratification
of .the canal treaty. It is added, however, that at the
time Dr. Herron was interviewed on the subject he
declined to make any statement concerning the Pan
ama situation, giving as a reason that he had not re
ceived definite information as to the cause or the na
ture of the recent troubles.
The argument of the State Department, and Dr.
Herron is that no matter what may have caused the
conflict in Panama, the very fact that it has occurred
will convince all factions in the Colombian Congress
that the surest and speediest way to establish peace
on the isthmus is to have it guaranteed by a strong
government like that of the United States. It would
be easy for Panama to revolt against the Colombian
Government, and it would not be easy foi the Gov
ernment to suppress the outbreak. Hence it is as
symed that the Colombian Congress in the interests
of the republic will be inclined to put an end to the
present uncertain situation by ratifying the treaty and
leaving the rest to us.
Later reports from Panama do not confirm the first
â¢statements concerning the cause of the action of
General Cobos in removing the Governor of the
province and in attempting to arrest him and put
him in jail. The early report was that the troops
had demanded pay. and the Governor had declined
it, and that it was to satisfy his men that Cobos ran
thf Governor out of the country and imprisoned va
rious members of the Cabinet. The latest story is
thit the Governor had not defaulted in the payment
of the troops, ind was not at all to blame for any
thing that happened. The report' goes that General
Cobos had a dinner, at which champagne flowed
freely, and that, being under the influence of the
effervescent wine, the General effervesced himself and
went sparkling forth in a gay humor and upset the
government by way of a frolic.

The report of the impending novelty in industrial
conflicts comes from Germany and is contained in
a special dispatch from Berlin to the New York Sun.
It runs thus: "Berlin, July 29. â The combination of
German wireless telegraph systems professes its abil
ity to frustrate every . attempt of Marconi agents to
receive transatlantic messages in England by erect
ing a strong station on the German coast and pro
pelling electric. waves in the direction of the Marconi
current.* Members' of the combination repudiate
Marconi's assertion that willful interruption would be
chicanery, -contending that it would be self-defense
against Marconi's attempt to secure a world-wide
monopoly." . .
The scheme has a high and mighty sound, and. if
carried' out may result fn stupendous things. Should
the Germans erect stations along their coasts to hurl
forth electric waves across the ocean to shut off
wireless" messages from New York to Britain, then
of course the; Marconi company in- self-defense and
in the practice of scientific retaliation would erect
larger stations on the coasts of the United States and
of Great Britain and send forth on their side still
more potent electrical charges to baffle and blight
the German systems of wireless telegraphy. In the
end all great national or commercial systems of the
new form of telegraphy would have to follow the
example of the Germans and the Marconi people,
and then a telegraph war would be a very extraor
dinary affair indeed. VÂ»?Â»vÂ£
All must agree with the German assertion that the
proposed interruption of the rival system by a wire
less method wpuld not be "chicanery." Marconi
made use of the wrong word* when ht hurled that
charge against his foes. The best thing he can do
is to get the controllers of various systems of wire
less telegraphy to hold an international peace con
gress and agree upon a code of wireless ethics. Then
if the Germans or any other rivals set about pro
pelling electric waves across the path of his messages
he can denounce them for committing breaches of
etiquette and get them expelled off the earth for
violating the ethics of the profession. In the mean
time the public will* watch the progress of the con
test with a good deal of interest: it is a new kind
offight and promises to be thrilling.
t T , 7 IRELESS telegraphy has got safely beyond
Y/\/ the experimental stage and has entered the
â¢ y domain of things practical, and now troubles
multiply. Among the, rival and competing inventors
there are* fights of. many kinds with which'the pub
lic has long been familiar, and it now appears there
is. to be. a new kind of battle, one unheard of be
foreâa battle,- indeed, which could not' have been
waged prior to the invention itself, for it is nothing
more nor less than, a wireless conflict of .wireless
fo'rees operating in the atmosphere and mutually de
strdying.one another.

a distribution of the estate. Their peti
tion for distribution was set for hearing
yesterday, but was. continued until Thurs
day afternoon to allow Attorney C. I*
Wheeler, for Executor W. G. Henshaw,
to find authorities supporting the claim
of Henshaw that a contract he has with
the heirs, giving him 10 per cent of their
legacies in addition to his fees, is a per
fectly legal document.
The existence of the contract was ad
mitted in court yesterday by Wheeler.
With the admission came a request for
several weeks' time to provide proof of
its legality, and of Henshaw's unselfish
ness in the matter. Four days was all
the court would allow, however, after
listening to strenuous objections by At
torney J. S. Partridge for the heirs, who
said that his clients needed the money.
They were willing, he said, to allow the
executor to retain in his possession prop
erty .valuable enough to provide for the
payment of the 10 per cent commission, in
the event that the contract was held to
be valid; but demanded that Wheeler be
compelled to furnish his points and proof
of Henshaw's purity of motive without
further delay.
The heirs of Mrs. Cogswell are Harry
Skellinger, a nephew residing in this city,
and .'Laura Robley, a sister, and
her two daughters, Elizabeth Robley
and Laura Richardson, who live In Con
necticut. .They claim that Henshaw is
doing all "in his power to delay the dis
tribution of the Cogswell estate because
the longer it is held intact the larger his
fees will be.

A wedding of much interest in the so
cial world was celebrated yesterday at
the noon hour at Trinity Church, when
Miss Alma McClung, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. J. W. McClung, became the bride of
Lieutenant Frederick Home of the U. S.
S. Alert. The popular couple were en
gaged for 8ome time, but the date of the
wedding was not known, so this news
will come as a surprise to many friends
of the young- people.
Only a few of the more intimate friends
of the bride and groom were present to
witness the ceremony. It was simple-,
and after the vows the bridal party vu
driven to the home of Mr. and Mrs. Mc-
Clune:.
Miss McClung is a society favorite in this
city and she. has a host of friends. The
groom -is well known here and is a prom
inent naval officer. Mr. and Mrs. Home,
after a brief honeymoon, . will go to San
Diego. , . , .. :
MASTER MECHANIC-Subscrlber.CfT-
For such information as you desire aboit
th* master mechanic of the electric ro.d
!n pSscott, Ariz., address a letter of to
quiry to the company there.
'He has now managed to win his way back to the
Senate, and it seems has also managed to quietly work
his way to the front and. win a following strong
enough to give him a commanding position as a
Presidential candidate. It is said that not only will
his own State be for him, but. that Pennsylvania will
follow and the Solid South *will come trooping be
hind to sustain hjm in the convention'. With such z
showing to start with :t is announced he. will easily
obtain further support from the East and from the
West, and that Bryan himself will stand in and help
to make the thing unanimous.
So far, then, as party leadership is concerned Mr.
Gorman appears to fill the bill of Democratic needs.
When it comes to considering the popular vote, how
ever, it will be found that the Maryland boss is lack
ing in many things ; required of a candidate who is
to have a fair prospect of carrying a majority of the
Electoral College. His career in the Senate has not
been of a kind to win public confidence. His name is
associated with no great measure of public policy,
nor has he shown any of the elements of either a
great popular leader or a great constructive states
man. His candidacy would arouse no enthusiasm
among the masses nor give assurance of an adminis
tration devoted to the general welfare. - In short, he
would be a machine candidate merely and could
hardly count upon obtaining any support outside of
the dyed in the wool stalwarts, who would vote for
anybody the convention might nominate.
Moreover, as the issues of the time are now shaping
themselves it is more than likely that he would be
one of the weakest candidates that Democracy could
possibly select. In the Eastern States and in some
of the Mississippi Valley States there has been going
on for some time a strong agitation in favor of the
old Cleveland tariff reform policy, but the nomination
of Gorman would stultify that movement, for it is
known that Gorman was chief among the Senators
who were" accused by Cleveland of "perfidy and dis
honor" because of their opposition to the Wilson
tariff bill. Another important movement of the
time is that directed toward the suppression of il
legal acts on the part of the great corporations of the
country. Roosevelt has made a strong record on.
the popular side of that issue, but Gorman has none
that his friends would care to see exploited.
In Â«hort, Gorman can hardly be expected to win
the . support of any considerable percentage of the
independent vote. He will be strong neither with the
tariff reformers, the sound money men nor the anti
trust men. His record is against him on every issue
of the time, and his nomination would tesult in
nothing more than a charge of the old guard of
Democracy go::g up as a forlorn Â»hope against the
overwhelming sv.asses Â©f the American pe6ple.
OUT of the confusion of the Democratic camp
there has come another shout of joy, hailing
the discovery of a Moses to lead the wan
derers out of 'the wilderness of opposition into the
promised" land of Federal offices and spoils. This
time the shout comes from Pittsburg, and the man
hailed as the chosen leader is the old familiar Mary
land boss, Arthur Pue Gorman.*?:* "
That Gorman would make a good leader for the
machine is unquestionable. He is a past master of
the art of wire-pulling, and he knows all the intrica
cies of the mechanism of party politics. He knows
how to preach party discipline and how to practice
it on occasions. His reputation as a politician is not
surpassed by that of any man in his party, and his
adroitness in evading difficulties is remarkable.,. He
did not support Bryan actively during the campaign
of 1896, but neither did. he. bolt the ticket. He was
?iot among those who followed Palmer and Buckner,
neither did he like David Bennett Hill go into rer
.tireraent and pass the weary! months .sucking his
paws like an old bear in winter quarters. In short,
he managed to hunt with the hounds while running
with the hare, and emerged from the campaign with
a good party standing, but at the same time with a
record that led Maryland to go Republican and retire
him from the Seriate. ; ': â¢ r. ,

which our oriental trade is increasing.' As \compared
with exports of over $1,000,000,000 to Europe the
total Asiatic exports' of $60,000,000 is small. Still
the trade is growing. It will be a long time'before
the Chinese people become able to consume Ameri
can products in anything like the quantity and the
quality that now find markets in Europe; but "we
may reasonably expect a steady increase right along,
and perhaps with the opening of new ports and the
awakening of some of' the Chinese provinces to civil
ization the time may not be far distant when our ex
ports to China alone will .reach a value of $ioo,ooo,Â«
000 a year. In the meantime we must please our
selves with the big percentages shown by comparing
the figures of to-day with those of the comparatively
petty trade of a decade ago.

Daniel A. Ryan presented the second or
opposition ticket. He denied that it was
in opposition to. President Harrison, say
ing every member of the club loved him
and commended hls v dlstingulshed leader
ship and his policy. This ticket contained
the names of H. 8. Russ, Arthur K. Bru
man, T. I. Fitzpatrlck, Dr. O. B. Burns
and T. J. Powers.
Theodore F. Bonnet moved the adoption
of the ticket headed by Mr. Spreckels
and that the vote be by viva voce. . This
was seconded by'J. F. Cunningham. Upon
the question being putthere was a thun
der of "ayes" and a feeble , "no. 1 .' 'This
completed the business of the - evening
and the meeting adjourned.
When President Harrison called the
meeting to order he faced an unusually
large and representative gathering of
members. He prefaced his remarks by
saying that four hours before he left the
heart of a great forest where all was
peace, narmony and good fellowship. He
hoped, now that he was in the heart of a
great club, the same conditions would
prevail.
He then called for nominations and
Henry R. Mann presented the ticket
headed by the name. of J. D. Spreckels
and which was subsequently chosen as
the regular ticket. Frank H. Gould sec
onded the nomination. He was frequently
Interrupted by applauBe.
He said he was grateful to be afforded
an opportunity to second the nomination
and to testify to his admiration of the
present administration. He outlined the
many improvements which had iiieen
made and the spirit of progress which
had made the Olympic Club the best of
its kind in the United States. He said
tthis was no time for compromise and
asked the members to stand .by the offl
cers who had stood by them. He* told
them the club was "blessed with having
a man at its head who not only knows
but does. He paid graceful compliment
to President Harristti for hi* work in be
half of the club ana said he hoped there
would be no dissenting voice nor nomi
nation. . ,
The opposition vanished into thin air
at the Olympic Athletic Club last night
when the members met in the Post-straet
gymnasium to select a regular nominat
ing ticket for the forthcoming election.
The administration ticket was chosen
by an overwhelming majority. President
William Greer Harrison and his confreres
on the board of officers were given evi
dence of the high esteem in which they
are held by the members of the club.
The ticket nominated by the committee
chosen last night will go before the 'club
at the forthcoming election as the regu
lar ticket. The committee is made up of
J. D. Spreckels, W. H. Hanrahan/A. P.
Hampton, Hermann Oelrlchs and L. L.
Cooper.
An opposition ticket will bo placed in
the field, but it is not expec<ed to meet
with any more favor than it did last
night
Running home to the finish line, in such
a breeze as the old boat ought to be at
her best, the cup hunter added almost five
minutes to her victory, an astonishing
performance.

ATLANTIC HIGHLANDS, N. J., Aug.
4.â Captain Wringe oT the Shamrock III
and Captain Bev^s of the Shamrock I got
into a hot contest in to-day's race of the
two boats off Scotland Lightship, and the
masterly fashion in which* the * clever
skippers handled the big races delighted
Sir Thomas Llpton and Captain McKins
ley of the Teutonic and Captain Bertram
F. Hayes of the Arabia, his guests, as
well as the Erin's company. Captain
Wringe, who haa yet to discredit Sir
Thomas' word that he is the best of
Great Britain's skippers at getting a cov
eted position at the start, sent the chal
lenger over the line with the older boat
under her lee for a ten-mile beat to wind
ward and a run home on a rattling twen
ty-two-knot breeze from the southeast.
The conditions were the old boat's best
chance, and Captain Bevis fretted for fif
teen minutes while his craft was blank
eted by the fleeter-footed challenger.
Then he whirled the Shamrock I about
on the other tack. Captain Wrlnge fol
lowed, and again blanketed Bevis' craft.
The Shamrock I promptly tacked again
and Just as promptly the challenger
whirled about. Seven tacks were made in
three minutes, eac^h time the Shamrock
III holding the old boat under her lee.
The seventh, Captain Bevis got headway
on his boat, while the challenger was fill
ing away, and the Shamrock I slipped
through the challenger's lee and got her
wind clear, but she had not the heels to
hold it. The Shamrock III was still to
windward and soon overhauled her pace
maker, so that the latter had t* tack
again. Captain Wringe did not follow,
but gave his attention to getting to the
turnlny mark. Up to that time the old
boat had held her own well, but after
ward she rapidly dropped astern and was
beaten by two minutes seventeen seconds
elapsed time at the turn.

After the lunch hour the champion took
a. twenty-two-callber rifle and , tramped
the adjacent hills in' search of small
game. He participated in a game of base
ball after dinner and about 9 o'clock re
tired to the gymnasium again, where he
punched the bag for about an hour. He
next took a mineral water plunge, was
rubbed , down and then went to his bed,
thus completing* strenuous day.
As a preliminary to the evening exer
cise Billy Lyons and Dick. Adam's put on
the gloves. Luke Kelly _of San- Pedro
acted as referee. In the first round Lyons
laid away and Adams came up for the
second brimful of confidence. Then Lyons
cut loose, making Adams think everybody
in the gymnasium was tossing a* glove at
him. Lyons' footwork was superb and
his auger punch proved disastrous. Ad
ams, through clever ducking, made a
draw of it. F. E. MULHOLLAND.'
The Jeffries of the future will unques
tionably be a different man from the Jef
fries of the past. He will no longer take
matters quietly, permitting his opponents
to wear themselves out vainly endeavor
ing to cause dents in his anatomy or
puncture the skin on his face, but will
rush and mix matters as Sullivan of old
did. At this game ho looks invincible^ At
the conclusion of the go with Fitz, Jeff
boxed three rounds each with Joe Ken
nedy and Jack Jeffries, and he. spared
neither of them, finishing up apparently
fresh.
His breathing apparatus was good and
it was the opinion of all who viewed the
bout that the champion had never before
displayed such speed. Not only was he
fast with his hands, but his footwork, too,
seemed remarkably sharpened, until Fitz
simmons found it almost impossible to es
cape the big fo'.low's rushes, and this in
a twenty-five-foot ring. Jeff was well
pleased with himself, and says he will
continue to acquire speed.
Well, the champion unpacked a box of
jabs, hookn and swings to-day that no
body ever accused him of possessing.
Jeff opened hostilities by a short run on
the road, an hour's preliminary exercise
with the gymnasium apparatus, Incident
ally skipping the rope 1200 times. Then,
before a selected few. he went three
straight rounds with Fltzsiramons, and
they were corkers for sure. The big fel
low slammed punches in on Fltz's angular
frame and received some himself by reÂ«
turn mall, until, from the outside it must
have sounded like a carpet receiving a
thorough dusting in some cleaning estab
lishment. In the second round Jeffries
neglected to remove his chin and stopped
a half-developed left uppercut, - which
caused him to bite his tongue slightly.
At the close FiU's mouth was bleeding,
his reserve air chambers were exhausted
and he welcomed Billy Delaney's call of
time as a hobo does a turkey handout.
The elimination of long, tiresome runs on
the road ia certainly proving beneficial to
Jeffries.
advised his pre-empting a claim
on the Indio tuberculosis reservation
could not have been present on Monday
morning to see the champion at work.
All along Bob Fitzslmmons has felt de
pressed because Jeff did not box oftener
and "send them in," as the Australian
expressed it. "I never askedÂ»any of my
trainers to spare me," said Fitz, "and
that's the sort of work Jeff needs." '

and only one was down, but at that they
could not get a man over tha rubber.
Schwartz and Murdock each singled to
left field, -and Moose Baxter beat out a
hot ona to short. Dr. Moskiman drove
a hard liner right into the hands of Ros3.
The latter threw the ball so accurately
to the nlate that Murdock was afraid
to take a chance of being caught. Then
Messerly ended the agony with a short
fly to Toman.
Little Ross played a great game In left
field. He had five chances, two of them
at least beinsr good for hits on nearly
any one's ball field. Both Spies and Gor
ton threw well to second, and consequent
ly there was not a stolen base on either
side. The score:

SUMMARY.
Errors â Drinkwater. Smith, Messerly. Cra
vath. Schwartx. Sacrifice hits â Rosa, Toman.
First base on errors â Los Angeles 2. First baa*
en called balls^ â Off Lee 3, off Drtnkwater 1.
Left on bases â Oakland 6. Los Anvetcs 3.
Struck out â By Lea 1. Time of fame â 1 hour
and 30 minutes. Umpire â O'Connell.
O'Hara opened the game with a driva
past Dillon. Then Francks smote an easy
bounder right Into the mitts of Drink
water. In his anxiety to get tha ball to
the second bag in a hurry, and thua head
off the speedy jO'Hara, ho sent bal1
far Into center* field.
O'Hara reached third In safety and was
about to anchor there for a while, and
maybe for cood, when Dummy Hoy's
throw arrived. Big Smith was Indulg
ing in a siesta and he neglected to in
tercept the course of the rapidly travel-
Ing sphere. This gave O'Hara a chance
to sprint for the plate, where he landed
with the only run.
Lee was in wonderful form. Never be
fore since he linked his fortunes with
those of Peter Lohman at the begin
ning of the present season has the- lazy
twirler shown such quality. His control
was good, something remarkable consid
ering his previous record. In only two
Innings did tha Angels land on him. One
hit was .made each time and neither
counted. The Angels could hit pop flies,
but that was about their limit.
Drinkwater was also In the running
some himself. He allowed eight hits,
none of which counted. Ho practically
lost his own game in the initial round
by throwing the ball way to tha outfield
on an easy chance. After that tha young
man with the temperance namo tu him
self once more and not another Cripple
registered.
Not an Angel footstep imprinted Itself
on the path between home and third
basÂ« at the Oakland baseball grounds
yesterday, thanka to the elusive offer
ings of the easy going Mr. Lee. Only
one of the Cripples rounded the final turn
of the bases, still one was enough to win.
Score, 1 to 0.

Lasso was mads favorite in the third

down a point from 7 to 2. The win
ner unexpectedly turned up ln.MoMe T,
an outsider, at 15 to 1. She went to the
front at flagrfall and increased her lead
throughout the race, wfnning with great
ease. Lasso, in a drive, took, the place
from Hook Sea Oka. Evea G got off well,

Captain Martin Files Report for the
"WORK PERFORMED BY THE
DETECTIVE DEPARTMENT
Anna Erickson, who on April 30 last
was severely Injured in a collision be
tween a Larkin-stroct and a Mission
street car, filed a suit for $10,297 damages
against the United Railroads yesterday.
She charges that the collision was the
result, of .carelessness. *.
Says Company Was Careless.
Policeman Joseph Teutenberg was con
victed by Police Judge Conlari yesterday
on a charge of disturbing the peace and
wan ordered to appear for sentence this
morning. The, complaining witness was
Dr. M. H. Schord, a dentist, who used
to have rooms at Teutenberg's residence,
602 McAllister street. ; The trouble arose
over a sign which Dr. Schord put up In
front of the Teutenberg residence that
he had removed to 697 McAllister street.
There is also a charge pending against
Teutenberg on complaint of Dr. Schord
before the Police Commissioners.
Policeman Teutenberg Convicted.
Upon thlB letter the prosecution bases
its case. The Government alleges that
the photographic copy of Lynch's signa
ture sent by Foster in order to verify
the same was received by Dillard, who,
in order to cover up his tracks, replied
that It was genuine. The defense points
to thÂ« fact that if it was an attempt to
conceal anything Dillard would not have
made a press copy of the letter sent
Foster. It is asserted that Dillard would
not have been so foolhardy as to leave
evidence of his crime.
There are thirty-three counts In the In
dictment against the negro. Of this num
ber nineteen have. been presented to the
Jury. An attempt will be made to convict
Dillard. The evidence against him is very
Btrong, but his attorneys, Samuel M.
Shortridge and T. C. West, are hopeful
of an acquittal. Mr. Shortridge will cross
examine Collector Lynch this morning.
Lynch told how Dillard, who was a
deputy collector â¢ in his office, came to
him and begged for a few days off In
order that he might go to Los Angeles
to attend to urgent business. He also
Becured come money in advance and then
disappeared. Lynch swore he never saw
the colored man again until the first day of
the trial. He told how he discovered evi
dence of Dillard's wrongdoing and made
effort to locate him. Lynch swore posi
tively that the letter eent to United
States District Attorney Foster of Texas
in the-Yee Too You case was never writ
ten by himself. He said it was a forgery,
and accused Dillard of uttering it.
Documentary evidence was Introduced
yesterday in the case of William H. DU
lard, the negro Federal employe who Is
on trial before Judge de Haven and Jury
for the alleged forgery of Collector
Lynch's signature and for Issuing fraud
ulent Chinese certificates.
There was a large gathering in Judge
de Haven's court when the case was
taken up in the afternoon. John C.
Lynch, Collector of Internal Revenue for
the First District of California, was again
on the stand and underwent a direct ex
amination at the hands of United States
Attorney Marshall Woodworth.
Signed His Name to Letters
and Certificates.

The main entrance,"* which is now being
erected on the corner of Eddy and Ma
son streets, will be finished in metal and
marble, with staircases outside of the
line of the main building and not interfer
ing at all with the seating capacity. .This
entrance to the building will be con
structed entirely of fireproof material and
rise to a height of three stories. Each
floor will be devoted to the same purpose,
namely, as vestibule and staircase to each
gallery and cafe. The arches on the first
floor, the balconies on the second and
the grand colonnade running up and ex
tending to the third floor, the spacious
plate glass openings which will permit a
full view from the street of the grand
staircases and elevators make of the en
tire scheme of planning something very
satisfactory. The corner building is flank
ed on either side with towers passing up
to a height of 60 feet.
The manager, 'William H. Leahy, has!
exerted himself to the upmost to finish j
the building on September 15. when the
house will be opened with grand opera
by special talent from Italy.
Immediately off the foyer on either side
of the extreme end of the same are to
be found ladles' parlors, and on each end
of the foyer there are also to be found
two extra staircases above the main foy
er floor to upper gallery, with emergency
exits on either side of the main building.
The most commendable feature of the
entire building is the many j exits from
the main floor of the theater to the im
mediate streets, for In addition to the
main entrance on the street corner,
which consists of three archways 12 feet
In width, there are also two other side
entrances, one passing Immediately to
Eddy street and the other to Mason
street, each being 12 feet in width, mak
ing all told the very unusual total exit
width on a levÂ«Â»l of the streets without
steps from the auditorium of 60 feet, per
mitting of the instant exit of the people
from the auditorium to the street.
The building: will be completely heated
with hot water and ventilated after the
most approved forced draught system
and no expense is to be spared in mak
ing it safe.

structure in the interior with a top floor
beyond the line of the meater proper
and extending over the present buildings
on the street line, which will be devoted
exclusively to a crand cafe. This will
have access to the upper gallery floor
through arcades from the main audito
rium. This cafe on the outside will be
In full view of the street and it is In
tended to make it one of the moot com
plete cafes In the city. The main fea
ture to be commended in this building is
the fact that the auditorium is absolutely
free from all Incumbrances in the way
of columns on the line of sight.

Irishman's Ground for Suit.
Samuel Davis, court stenographer of the
Second Circuit, says that an Irishman
who, several years ago, tried to engage
the legal services of his father, had the
oddest ground for a lawsuit he has ever
heard of. The Irishman' wanted, to sue
his landlady for $15. He explained- that
he made a contract to pay her $3 a week
for board, but she was to deduct 25 cents
for every meal he missed. Having got
the contract duly signed, Pat began to
board elsewhere and charged the landlady
with whom he had contracted 25 cents for
every meal he missed. He figured that by
managing this way he missed $5 25 worth
of meals each week, for which his con
tract required him ; to pay only $3, , so
that, by staying away he made $2 25 clear.
The landlady refused to pay him his
"profits," and he wanted Mr. Davis to
bring suit against her- for him. "Father
laughed at him a bit," Mr. Davis says,
"and he got Indignant 'A conthract Is a
conthract,' said Pat. 'and she ought to bo

in town, and some of them were pretty

By N. JARTAL.L, Secretary.
The first tourists from the Eaet taking
advantage of the G. A. R. rates reached
the city last night and there is no doubt
that large numbers will arrive dally from
now until the expiration of the tourist
concession. Active plans are under way
to give the visitors a hearty reception
when the delegations are all in.
The reception committee of the thirty
seventh national encampment, Grand
Army of the Republic, Major General W.
R. Shafter chairman, met at headquarters
In the Grand Hotel last evening. The at
tendance of army comrades and other
representative citizens was large. The
chairman announced that it would be the
pleasure and duty of the committee to ex
tend a cordial welcome on behalf of San
Francisco to the incoming veterans, and
suggested that as many members of the
committee as could get - time to go out
on the railroad and meet the Incoming
trains should report for duty at the head
quarters of the reception committee.
The rooms in the Palace Hotel formerly
used by the Republican State Committee
have been assigned to the reception com
mittee. ; .
Many of the members present at the
meeting designated days on which their
Eervlces would be at the disposal of the
chairman. Among those that enlisted for
the campaign were:
Major General Dickinson, Major General
Turnbull. Jud?Â« A. J. Buckles, W. C. Van
Fleet. Charles Edelman. N. J. Brlttan, Elmore
C. Lefflngwell, George W. strohl, Jesse- B
Fuller, Dr. Voorsanger, A. W. Barrett, W. H.
A Triumph for the Motor Car.
The first trip across the American con
tinent In an automobile has beÂ«n made
and the result is a signal triumph for this
comparatively new means of travel. It
would test the powers of endurance of a
railway express locomotive to run an av
erage of twelve hours every day for two
full months, * but this is the feat per
formed by the automobile which carried
Dr. H. Nelson Jackson and 'his chauffeur
from San Francisco to New York.
That the Journey was made without se
rious mishap or accident, and that the
vehicle showed little signs of .wear and
tear at the end of the trip, speaks highly
for the quality of - the machinery and
workmanship. In crossing Northern Cali
fornia, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nebras
ka, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana some of
the worst highways in 'the United States
must have been traversed, roads that
would not be wholly compensated for by
those of Pennsylvania â¢ and . New York,
which; fortunately for the travelers, gave
pleasure to the last stage of the remark
able Journey.
As a- rule Dr. Jackson ran his ma
chine twelve hours" a day. Sometimes
the journey was continued at night, and
there were davs - when the .wheels were
kept going from 6 in the morning' until
midnight. This was 'an unusual strain
even for the best of roads, and none but
a good mechanical equipment could have
stood it. â¢ '
This Journey was made purely. for pleas
ure and to satisfy an enthusiastic motor
ist that It could be accomplished. But It
*ias demonstrated much more than this
It has shown the possibilities of the au
tomobile even with the generally disrep
utable highways which are characteristic
of nearly every rural district in: the coun
try. But when rood roads shall be the
rule instead of the exception.. in every
State It may be predicted with confidence
that such Journeys as that made by Dr.
Jackson will be far from extraordinary.
And while the entire trip across the con
tinent will not often be made with one
machine., it is entirely within the proba
bilities that before a great -while sturdy
touring 'motor cars will be at-the disposal
of travelers for successive stages of the
entire distance.
H. M. William*, chief steward of the
big steamship Algoa, now lying. in the
bay. is missing and a bride of four days
is vainly seeking to learn his where
abouts. Williams was married last Fri
day to a Miss Schoeder, who lives with
her sister, Mrs. Canlni, at 1812 Geary
street. Saturday afternoon he told her
he would have to report aboard ship again
and left her. She has not seen him $lncÂ«
and he has not been aboard the Algoa.
Captain Albert Lockett of the Algoa
was called upon yesterday by B. H. Vee
der, a sailor's outfitter on the front.
Veeder had a note for $30 given him by
Williams and purporting to bear the In
dorsement of the captain. .
Veeder sajd Williams had asked for a
loan of $50 on his note and Veeder said
the paper would have to bear a good in
dorsement Williams said he would get
his skipper to affix his name. He went
away and when he came back the note
bore what purported to be IÂ»ckett's "sig
nature. The name had been written with
an indelible pencil.
Captain Lockett told Veederthat he had
not indorsed the note, but that he would
stand good for the' amount, vs Williams
was all right. He rubbed out the pencil
signature and wrote his own In Its place.
Veeder went away satisfied.
Mrs. Williams has visited the front ev
ery day since her newly made husband's
disappearance, looking for him. Captain
Loekett fears something serious may have
befallen Williams.
Other friends of tha missing steward
express the belief that he Is on a spree
and will come back again soon if such Is
the case. Others say he never drinks to
excess.
When seen at her home last evening
the bride did not show any traces of anx
iety or Buffering. She Is rather a striking
looking woman of the blonde type.
"I havÂ© little to Bay." was her reply to
questions. "This matter haa all been
fixed up and I do not wish to have It ap
pear in the papers.
"No, my husband has not been home
since, nor do I know where he is. I know
that he will come back to me.. He must
be away on business, otherwise he would
not have been gone so long. I have noth
ing more to cay, for I dread notoriety."

WELX-KNOWN MERCHANT
IS CALLED BY DEATH
Henry Cowell Succumbs to the Ef-
fects of a Wound in the
Shoulder.
Henry Cowell, for many years a promi
nent merchant In this city, passed quietly
away at an early hour yesterday morning
at his late residence," 413 Hyde street.
The cause of death Is said to have been a
bullet wound received in the southern
part of the State several months ago.
At that time Mr. Cowell had been visit
ing his ranch in Merced County. He had
some trouble with a man named Ingolds
by over land. The latter shot Cowell
with a revolver, the bullet taking effect
in the shoulder.
The Injured man apparently recovered
from the effects of the wound, but lately
it had bothered him and is said to have
completely wrecked his nervous system.
He was taken ill several days ago and
became worse till he passed away yester
day morning. No arrangements have as
yet been made for the funeral.

THE importance of San Francisco
as a military center has Increased
rapidly within the last few years.
New army posts have been es-
tablished at different points on
the hnrbor shore and the old posts have
been enlarged and their garrisons in
creased. Once upon a time, and that not
very long ago, the little steamer General
McDowell made light work of maintain
ing passenger and freight communication
between the different harbor posts. As
the poFts grew in number and increased
in size, however, the McDowell's capacity
was taxed to the utmost. The growth
continued until It reached a point beyond
the McDowell's capacity and the army
authorities asked Congress for an adu3
tional boat. This request was granted
and the Risdon Iron Works has been
awarded the contract for the construc
tion of a steamer to be used In conjunc-
tion with the McDowell in maintaining
a regular Bervlce between thÂ« local army
posts.
This new boat Is now being built and
the accompanying drawing made from
the Government plans is presented to the
public for the first time, and by The Cafl.
The name the new boat will bear has
not yet been decided. When in commis
sion she will become one of Uncle Sam's
permanent harbor fleet and the details of
her construction will be of general in
terest.
She will be built of steel and over tn-o
thlrds of her length will be built a steel
"bouse with a cabin at the after end to ac-

was found roaming the streets this after
noon at Thirty-eighth street and Tele
graph avenue In a partly demented condi
tion. She was taken to the Receiving
Hospital, where she was held under ob
servation. The Indications are that over
work and using stimulants are responsi
ble for her condition.
The cold day had chilled her and the
exposure adding to her overwrought con
dition had the effect of making her
speech almost unintelligible. She stated
that she had been divorced from hex hus
band, whose name was" Scott, last Feb
ruary. The papers In the case show that
Scott got the divorce on the ground of
cruelty, she being addicted to the use of-
Intoxicants. She is 23 years of age. %

Vineyards of State Will
Suffer a Decrease
in Crops. ,
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Aug. 4.\
The grape vines of California have been
attacked by a new disease, that is, a
disease that has never before been noticed
by vitlculturists in this State. It is not
particularly destructive and now that it
has been discovered It may be checked,
but Its effect will be to decrease the grape
crop this year. The vlneyardlsts of So
noma and Napa counties are the greatest
sufferers by this latest visitation;
The disease manifests Itself by rotting
the roots and stems, beginning at the
top; turning the leaves red around the
veins, or wilting the stems of the leaves
or the tender young shoots that spring
up at the bane of the parent vine.
Professor E. H. Twlght, Instructor In
viticulture at the University of California,
has Just returned from an inspection of
the affected vines. He believes they can
be treated successfully and he has started
8. series of experiments to cure the dis
ease. Whether the trouble Is fungus or
bacterial In origin Professor Twlght has
not yet determined.

Various are the tools used by the tree
surgeons in prosecuting their labors,
many of. them not * unlike ' those used by
the M. D. There are scoops and spoons
Workers have proceeded by ridding the
tre.es Of all tho dry rot, then disinfecting
the exposed places with coal tar and fill
ing Â¦ them with California cement. The
cement takes the place- of the natural
wood and enough Is put Into the cavity
to bring It ; ta the edge of the bark. This
leaves a surface over which the bark
grows In time, thus enclosing the cement
If the cement was filled to the brim of
the bark the bark would \f>e retarded in
its growth and finally the tree would die.
The treatment of the trees has disclosed
some strange things. Most curious of
these is an oak i in- which the letters "G
R" werje cut years ago in the bark. This
left the* wood , exposed . to the weather,
which in time rotted deep, though it was
not apparent until the operators began
work upon it. In a few more years the
tree would have died.
FILLED WITH CEMENT.
In carrying out the instructions. Super
intendent Bolton, as chief surgeon, and
the surgeons under him have been ten
derly solicitous for the fathers of the
campus. In digging out the cavities and
filling them with more wholesome stun*
they have exercised the greatest care not
to hurt the tree, though there must be
inward groans when the drills pierce too
far. .Â»
Professor W. A. SetcheH of the botany
department of the university has been
watching with some apprehension the
encroachments of the dry rot on the trees.
Just before his departure for Europe re
cently he had a conference on the sub
ject with President Wheeler, to whom ha
said that something must bB done to save
tho oaks, and done at once. President
"Wheeler was alive to the necessity of Im
mediate treatment, and gave orders,
therefore, to Grounds Superintendent A*
L. Bolton to proceed according to Profes
sor Setchell's directions.
Tho most devitalizing affliction of the
oak is the dry rot. This usually mani-
Jests itself ax the places on the trunk
where the limbs have been broken or cut
off. Before the bark has had- time to
shield- the wound, the weather gets Into
It and the wpod rots away. Sometimes
there will be a hole several feet deep
where It Is least suspected. If this dls
ense Is not corrected It win eat Its way
into the heart of the tree, eventually kill
ing it.
ARRESTING DISEASE.
body In. the world has read or
heard about are submitting to a rejuven
ating process. It may not be as painful
as the surgery practiced on human be
ings, but It. Is doing a great deal of good
and the patient old oaks will come out
of the ordeal revivified and the better
equipped to withstand the Pacific winds.
Once in their lives oak treesâ the Cali
fornia kind, that isâ must be operated
upon. Like human beings, as they grow
older, . their vitality decreases. Their
withered limbs get more crusty, and the
dry rot takes hold of their trunks. In
their young days, say when they were
about 200 years oldâ for the university
oaks are estimated to be over 400 years
of ageâ they were strong enough to shake
off these manifestations of/ age. If the
wind made a wound in the. trunk of an
oak it soon healed over with new bark;
if a limb broke, It sent a new ono to take
its place. But in the infirmity of old age
the palsied tree can. no longer cover up
its injuries and it stretches out its
scraggy arms to man. appealing to him
for assistance In its distress.

cupied Is marshy and requires a heavy

Plans for the new terminus, which ad-.
Joins the property lately acquired by the
Western Pacific Railroad at the foot of

ment of Sixteenth-street depot and First

SUES TO GAIN
TERMINAL SITE
By the dismissal r to-day . of . aV- suit
brought' by Catherine ..Boogar "against
Philip Boogar the records of the Superior
Court were cleared of litigation, the his
tory cf which runs the gamut of excit
ing occurrences that put to- blush the
yellowest, of yellow backed dime, novel
literature. Accusations * from '. murder
down, poisonings, abductions, the clink
of much gold, an old man's Infatuation
for a buxom woman, divorce, bullets and
.a killing." police and detectives galoreâ all
contributed to the many chapters that
made Boogar vs. Boogar a case cele
brated In the annals of Alameda County.
Beginning with a battle between the
young wife and her aged^ spouse for pos
session of his fortune, the dramatic nar
rative closed with the shooting of. Philip
Boogar, bv Michael Collins, his wife's
father. .
The suit In point was brought by Mrs.
Boogar on a charge that the old man had
put his fortune out of her reach. A
divorce suit Instituted about the same
time was replete with sensation. Cruel
ties charged against old Boogar were met
by counter accusations that attempts had
been made by Mrs. Boogar to poison her
husband. Detectives by the dozen hov
ered about the couple. The old German
was hustled about from place to place,
hidden from his wife, who pursued and
for years kept open battle over the old
man's pots of gold, for it was estimated
he was worth $100,000.
The tension became so strong that one
day old Michael Collins met Boogar on
Eighth street In front of the Galindo Ho
tel and shot the old man. Boogar died
soon afterward. Then the fight of Mrs.
Boogar to save her father, who was ac
quitted, was followed by more battling
over the Boogar estate.
All of these years of litigation had cut
deeply into the bank accounts. Mrs. Boo
gar mannered to secure a house and lot
at the southeast corner of Franklin and
Eighth streets. The remainder of tl/e
fortune had dwindled to almost nothing.
To clear the records to-day's action was
taken. W. J. Dlngee and -Marie Reading
wene defendants named with old man
Boogar. the allegation being made that
they claimed an Interest In the property
for which Mrs. Boogar was fighting.

,N'EW YORK, Aug. 4-Tr.ngT^Eman Lit
tauer has made a statement, of which the
following is part:
VI am, of course surprised and disap- ;
pointed at the decision of the Secretary
Of War that there may exist even a prlma
facie ca*e of violation of statute. The
decision only creates an inquiry as to
whether a technical violation of law has
been committed, and removes from the ;
case entire ly any suggestion of dishonesty |
or- dishonorable action on my part, and
Of 'any improper use of my influence as
Â» .Congressman in regard to any glove
contracts.
â¢â¢Mr' Lyon m a general contractor to
Th/ War Department. There was award
fed to him a contract for 3000 muskrat fur
nuntleta, w^ieh he purchased from us at
B price of SI.^4 a pair. Subsequently Mr.
LytÂ»a hid, and his bid was accepted for I
BMgM similar gloves. After the acceptance
of "the bid he called on me to furnish him
1 xvft!? the goods. " I informed him that I ,
. would not furnish then at the price that
'â¢'.':, r i:>'i pairs had been furnished. Dur- Â¦
Â« \vg sonr conversation I took a sheet of
* paper Rr.d in my handv.-riting calculated
* the. price of the poods, which, with a 15 ,
y*r cer.t profit to my firm, would have |
flmourfic d to J1JS1 a pair, which was tue
price at which 1 had previously offered to â¢
make the gauntlets. During the discus- j
fri<ri I reduced thl? anticipated "profit to ;
20 r*:r cent, making the price 51.73.
"Mr. I,yon insisted that I had overesti- j
* mated the number of skins that would i
c enter in;o the production of a dozen ;
â¢fciovos and subjoined to my memorandum J
. in his handwriting his estimate of the j
! cost, which he fixed, after correction of I
his previous figures, at $1 46Â»i- I would j
* not acquiesce in his estimate of the cost ;
and he would not acquiesce in mine. He j
importuned me, however, not to leave
rtijm in the lurch, as he had already con- ;
vjraeted to furnlfh the goods to the Gov
ernment at 51 05. (It turned out that in
.fact hf had contracted for them at 51 70.
\ although I did not know it.) He finally
/ bought the goods at $1 C5, but I conceded
that- If it should be demonstrated after
the actual manufacture of thf goods that
they had cost me less than 51 C5 his ac
ri*unt would be credited with one-half of
the difference between the actual cost per
pair and $1 Co, at which we had sold the
" goods to him. This difference was ascer
tained to be $3507 05, and he. was credited
, with this rebate, which amounted to
i 51T6S 56.
"Our books save evidence In detail of
this transaction. Mr. LÂ»yon was charged
for the gloves at SI C5 a pair, and his ac
count was subsequently credited with the
rebate referred to.
"1 fall to see. and I am sure the com
* inanity will fall to see, how even a tech
.â¢ r.ica! or legal violation of any statute or
any code of moral cr commercial pro
priety or any invidious criticism or cen
Â«ure can be founded en this transaction."
That portion of the report dealing with
the Police Commission furnishes inter
esting reading. The total number of li
censed places in the city coming under
the Jurisdiction of that body is 3095. show
ing an increase of 43 far the year. Of ap
plications for permits 13.664 were re
ceived, of which 279 were refused. Res
taurants to the number of 360 hold li
censes to sell liquor with meals.
There are 678 employes of the Police
Department. During the year 102 were
appointed, 10 resigned, 9 died. 8 were dis
missed and 15 retired. The patrol wagon
made 23,318 runs and covered a distance of
39,249% miles.
The total amount of fines paid Into the
city treasury upon convictions In the po
lice courts was $22,831.
The amount of property reported lost or
stolen aggregated the large sum. of
$112,783 63. of which $68,072 03 was recov
ered. Ninety-eight fugitives from jus
tice were apprehended In this city and
taken back to stand trial. That the City
Prison Is a Mecca for the homeless is at
tested by the fact that 5146 were giv.en
accommodation. ' Fourteen prisoners es
caped. Chinese to the number of 2124 and
281 Japanese were brought In during the
year.
In addition to those arrested for these
specific offenses 2351 were arrested for va
rious misdemeanors and 421 on felony
charges. The most arrests were made In
December, 1902, when 2709 were taken in,
and the least in June of this year, when
2104 were arrested. A comparison of the
number of police and arrests made dur
ing the fiscal year ending June 30, 1S74. and
the one jU3t closed is interesting. Dur
ing the year 1S73-7.4 there were 121 police
and 13.C07 arrests, and during the last
year C43 police and 29.336 arrests.

Of burglars 261 were captured and 23
men came to grief while making attempts
at burglary. Three hundred and seventy
eight slaves of opium and 51 keepers of
establishments where the drug is enjoyed
were rudely disturbed by the ever vigilant
patrolmen. One hundred and twenty
seven deserters from the army were ap
prehended and turned over to the mili
tary authorities. Vagrants to the number
of 2233 came to grief.
The other causes of arrests were as fol

A report. that wIU.be of particular in
terest to all classes of. citizens and to
students of criminology in particular will
be submitted to his Honor the Mayor to
day by Chief of Police Wlttman. The
report Is a voluminous document and
gives evidence of careful preparation. It
deals minutely with all branches of the
department of which Chief Wlttman is
the official head, even the number of runs
made by the "municipal carriages," com
monly designated in the vernacular of
the street urchins as "hurry up wagons,"
being computed, and the number of miles
traversed along the highways and by
ways of thÂ«* city are given.
During theJ fiscal year ended June 30.
29,336 arrests were made and 10,111 per
sons were detained. Of this number
15,766 were taken into custody and incar
cerated for overindulgence in malt, fer
mented or spirituous beverages. For fail
ure to heed the expectoration ordinance
551 men suffered the indignity of being
compelled ' to appear before one of the
police magistrates. For disturbing the
peace and quietude of the municipality
1%8 were haled into court, and 368 mendi
cants were taken In for asking alma from
the sympathetic pedestrians.
CAUSES OF ARBEST.
GRAVE CONFLICT
IN THE EVIDENCE
Gibson also discovered that the stubs
in the | Eppinger check books show that
Superintendent Demming of the ware
house was paid his salary at the end of
every month. Some time ago Demming
put in a claim for $5000 said to be due
him for back salary, but Gibson asserts
that he has the stub books to prove that
Demming received all the salary that was
coming to him and that he is not, en
titled to another cent for his services.
While Gibson was at work in the ware
houses at Crockett, he discovered that
Edmund Friuend, the head bookkeeper of
the Pacific "Warehouse Company, one of
the holdings of the Dpplnger*. marked
the locks of " the Eppinger safe for the
American National Bank, two days be
fore the firm of Eppinger & Co. went to
the wall.
This evidence which Gibson, has col
lected will undoubtedly prove to be very
Important. In all probability it will tend
to show that Bookkeeper Friuend knew
that Eppinger & Co. were about to fail
several days before the nev.-s was made
public, though this as yet remains to be
proven.
Detective Thomas B. Gibson of the local
pcllce department, who has had charge
cf the Eppingrr failure investigation
since the shortcomings of the firm were
brought to light, returned to th!s city
from Crockett last night. Detective Gib
son Has been making a careful search
for more evidence at the warehouses for
several days past and now has on hand
facts that wlil more than likely lead to
Btartllng developments.

not be punished for contempt. La&t night
on the stand Winch declared that he
could not appear at the former meeting,
so his excuses were accepted, and he was
requested to be on hand next Wednes

DISABLED SCHOONER ABBIE
BEING ABANDONED BY
STEAM SCHOONER ALCAZAR.
WHEN Captain Martin cf the
Eteam schooner Alcazar re
ported on his arrival Monday
that he had been obliged to
leave the disabled schooner
Abbi* to take care of herself. A. W.
Beadle & Co. # the Abbie's owners, dis
patched the tug Sea Rover to the assist
ance cf the helpless vessel. The Sea Rov
er came into port yesterday morning with
the Abbie In tow.
The Abbie, while at Point Arena, broke
loose from her moorings and in the sub
sequent helpless floundering narrowly es
caped going ashore. As it was she car
ried away her rudder. The steam schoon
er Alcazar was towing the Abbie to port
when a heavy sea caused the parting of
the hawser with which she was pulling
the disabled craft. Three times the haw
ser snapped, and when the Alcazar's car
po took a sudden lurch to port Captain
Martin realized that the usefulness of
his vessel as a towbeat was at an end.
Captain Larsen rigged a jury rudder on
the Abbie and was getting along fairly
well, when, at 6:30 o'clock Monday even
ing, the Sea Rover came alongside. The
Rover remained In the vicinity of the
Abbie until daylight yesterday morning,
when she took hold of her and brought
her to port.
May Not Save Cargo.
The condition of the British ship Glencona,
which went aehore pome time ago at San Bias
and was later abandoned by captain and crew,
is worse than at first reported, and. It is very
doubtful if any or the vessel' e large cargo will
ever be recovered. The salvers report that on
Aucuct 6 seas wera breaking over the vessel,
which had become entirely submerged, and that
It was extremely improbable that any cargo
could be recovered. When wrecked the Glen
cona was on her way from Newcastle, England,
10 San Pieco with a cargo of firebrick, coke
and pig iron.

Hutchinson charges -that - Â¦'Â¦ the recent
slump in mining shares in South Africa
was â¢ artificial and effected ' by the mine
owners for the. purpose" of ' bringing the
public mind to favor Chinese labor. â¢
It was about this time, so Hutchinson
says, he went to England to agitate the
subject there. The plan of the mine own
ers is to Indenture the Chinese to Jo
hannesburg and at the expiration of their
indentures to expatriate them. As to
the possibility of terlous trouble between
the whites and the Chinese in the event
of the latter being imported into Johan
nesburg, Hutchinson remarked that hs
would not like to venture a prediction,
and he added:, .". .
I have explained to you the feeling existing
there and you know, what men sometimes do
wjiÂ«Â»n they see that their welfare .is being seri
ously Jeopardized, j What â¢ may happen in Jo
hannesburg will depend entirely upon the tem
perament of the white people who have Just
passed through one long, trying 'ordeal and are
now struggling for a peaceful future. Imagine
3C0.0O0 Asiatics, a class of people who will not
mingle with whites nnd who are 'In no way
their equals, taking up a i residence in the
Rand. That number would .almost equal the
white population, and suppose that some day
these Asiatics should rebel against, the mtne
owners and - eventually against all whites.
What would be our â¢ position?:. Certainly we
hate to contemplate .It. . â¢ i- Â¦
If the Chinese do come, it will only be after
a terrible struggle, but whether the- latter will
end' In bloodshed I dare not suggest.-
SERIOUS TROUBLE FEARED.
In April a- great mass meeting was held in
Johannesburg, the largest ever peld In that sec
tion of the world, and by a vote of 5000 against
2000 a resolution ' was passed pledging those
present to use every means to prevent the im
porting, of. Chinese. ..The meeting was followed
by others In neighboring" cities and towns, and
with similar results. . Until recently the Boers
held aloof, but a few weeks ago they united
with us and through their leader. General Bo
tha, expressed themselves absolutely against'
the Introduction of Chinese.-
The general Impression abroad has been that
the majority of the people of Johannesburg fa
vcred Asiatic labor, but quite the contrary is
the case. Agltat.on against the move has grown
stronger and stronger, and meetings have been
held to. emphasize the public protest.' British
officials have been appealed to and we have
received direct .assurance from Secretary Cham
berlain that he will- not approve of the intro
duction, of Asiatics into the colonies unless a
majority of the colonials give favorable voice
to It.'. The question before us. Is, how the pub
lic Is to be voiced,- for-we have no representa
tive Institution through which we can chow our
disapproval." The mine-owners, on the other
hand, while being in the minority in so far as
numbers are concerned, are possessed of power
ful influences. .
PUBLIC FEELING STRONG.
G. Hutchinson, a lawyer of Johannes
burg. South Africa, who has been figur
ing: prominently in the anti-Chinese agi
tation on the Rand and " who recently
went to England for the purpose of Im
pressing the British, home authorities
with the dangers that may result from
the wholesale importation of. Asiatic la
bor into the mines of f the former /Boer
territory, is at the Palace. He arrived
several days ago and is awaiting the de
parture- of the next- Australian steamer,
with a view of returning to South Afri
ca byway of the Antipodes. Three months
ago . two delegates, named Skinner and
Isoyes, of the- Chamber of Mlne3 of Jo
hannesburg passed through this city on
their way to China, where they are now
contracting for- thousands of Chinese to
operate the mines. ;
Hutchinson, Jn an Interview ye-sterday,
said that If the mission of these two del
egates was successful serious trouble
would result in South Africa. Continu
ing a discussion of the subject he said:
People of California have had their troubles
with the Chinese and they can readily appre
ciate our position in Johannesburg. Although
It was represented" at .. the time that Skinner
and Noyes started for China that they were
merely going to confer in the yrient as to the
possibility of getting Chinese, should they bÂ«
needed, we have since heard that they are ac
tually contracting for 300,000 Asiatics, who may
go to South Africa at any. time In the near
luture. â¢ Â»
MINE-pWNERS' CONTENTION.
The contention of the mine-owners' of Johan
nesburg originally was that the Kaffir labor of
the Rand was Inadequate for tne requirements
of the mines, and added to this was the asser
tion that the latter weie an Indolent race and
not to be depended upon. Those opposed to the
move of the mine-owners have taken the con
trary etand that labor in Johannesburg Is fully
adequate and that there Is no absolute neces
f-lty for the Importation of Asiatics on a scale
planned by the Chamber of Mines.
There are facts which the outside world
should know in order to clearly understand the
situation In South Africa. . Â¦â¢ .
After Lord Roberts entered and assumed con
trol of Johannesburg the. mine-owners proceeded
to reduce the price of labor nearly one-third.
The Kaffirs had a little money after the war,
and, being in somewhat comfortable circum
stances, they were not disposed to accept the
reduced wages, a fact which the employers im
mediately attributed to a disposition not to
work at all. In January the old schedule of
wages was resumed and the men began to re
turn to labor underground. Since .then the
number of men returning to the mines has In
creased* every month. The truth Is, the pres
ent wage scale wlll-.nqt permit the working of
the lower grade mines, and the owners con
ceived the Idea of Importing cheaper labor from
the Orient. ! ,,

Potatoes; Onions and Vegetables.
Potatoes ruled steady under a spirited local

i demand for lower-grade offerings for shlpmcu*
to the southwest. Heavy buying for Govern
! ment contracts also tended to strengthen the
' market. Sweet Potatoes and Onions wen
steady at previous prices.
I Nearly all descriptions of vegetables were in
free supply, and, although trade was active,
: prices tenSed downward. String and Lima
Beans ' and Green Corn were lower under in
creased, receipts, and Cucumbers, Summer
1 Squash, Egg Plant and Peppers continued very
weak. Receipts of Tomatoes were less liberal
than on the preceding day and as old stock
1 wa3 pretty well cleaned up, freshly arrived of
ferings moved off better at slightly firmer rates.
There was no shortage of supplies, however,
and sales of poor and old stock were still re
ported below the quoted rates. Green Okra
arrived freely and moved oft well at steady
i i prices.

Poultry and Game.
The Poultry market was more active than at
any time last week and the receipts cleaned
up well. The demand for fine large young
fowls was particularly brisk and large Broilers
' were quoted' higher. A car of AVestern, the
, '< first for the current week, was on sale and

I is scheduled for to-day's market.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter is weak at 24c as the top for almost
anything. The retailers are cutting up the
Eastern for their trade, which means just so
much less demand for the domestic product.
The demand is very Blow, and everybody is
complaining of the dullness of trade.
Cheese, like Butter, is very quiet, with deal
ers complaining of the prolonged dullness.
' Stocks are ample for all current needs.
The firmness in Eggs continues, with moder
ate stocks, decreasing receipts and a very fair
demand. There is no activity, however.
Receipts were 47,400 lbs Butter, bSO cases
Eggs and 0100 lbs Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The fruit market was still heavily supplied
with most descriptions of deciduous fruits and
aside' from a fair demand for choice, well
packed etock for shipment north on the Sound
steamer, market conditions ehowed but little
change from the previous report and were still
In buyers' favor.' The canners were backward
buyers of Peaches. Plums and Apricots, being
heavily Â«upplletl with Bartlett Pears, which I
continued to arrive freely. Peaches .in baskets
were In somewhat light receipt and ruled firm
at higher rates, but the general run of sup
plies in small and large boxes were plentiful
and weak. The top quotation for small boxes
was obtained only for choice shipping stock, 35c
j being the extreme figure for moet of theefferings
A few lots of Sawyer Seedlings in baskets sold |
i at 75Â©t>!ic per basket. There were heavy re
: celpts of Apples and Pears, chiefly low grade
â¢ stock, and lt was difficult to obtain $1 per
box for the best wrapped stock. Choice ship
ping Plums In crates were still scarce and
firm and Figs ruled steady under light re
ceipts. Cho!c*> offerings of Grapes were in fair
request for shipping account, but the local de
mand was slack and easy prices ruled. The
cool, cloudy weather had a depressing effect
on the market for 'Melons. Cantaloupes were
woak at !cwor nrlrcs. Nutmeg Melons and
Watermelons were unchanged, but prices con
tinued to have a wide range and dealers were
anticipating a lower range, particularly on
Watermelons, which were lrK excessive supply.
Prices of Berries . stood about as previously
quoted, receipts being light and the demand
steady. The only new feature in Citrus fruits
was the arrival of a car of fancy Valencia
Oranges, which cleaned up quickly at $2 75@3

The reipons* of Consolidated Gas to the an
nouncement of an additional stock lesuo cf
nearly $7,000,000 with subscription privileges to
stockholders rve<?mblÂ»-d that of Pennsylvania's
Â¦tock to the recent stock Increaae and that of
New York Central to the persistent rumors of
capital increase. Consolidated Gas sold off over
& poinu. The United States Steel storks
formed another center of disturbance. The
liquidation In these was met first with the
authoritative announcement of the resignation
of President Schwab. The persistence of tho
weakness gave rive to rumors of unfavorable
developments In the trade, especially growing
out of the building trade* lockouts, notably in
Pittsburg. Fears were also expressed that the
executive change In the corporation would give
rise to changes of policy, poesibly Involving u.
suspension of dividends on the common stock.
The decline of several points In Virginia-
Carolina Chemical and of in points in the pre
ferred was the occasion of some uneasiness.
Another supposed factor was derived from the
published reports of serious breakdown In the
health of an operator who has taken a very
prominent part In some of the great market
affairs of the last few years. It was not sup
posed, however, that the weakntos of the
market was due entirely to any special cauÂ«eR,
the general banking situation being considered
sufficient to explain the liquidation.
The Wail-street community has not relin
quished its study of the loan position of the
banks, which mi emphasized by the increased
ntrength In loans shown by last Saturday's
statement. The fact that large Increases in
failures in the general commercial nnd indus
trial lines reported by mercantile agencies gave
point to thÂ« depressing Influence of the com
plication.
The attention given- to rumors, which were
authoritatively denied, of the placing of a
la nrÂ« real eatate mortgage loan by tbe New
York Central indicated the dread In the specu
lative -world that the voracious demand by
great corporations for credits will continue to
enrrvach upon the available limits.
The Weather Bureau's weekly crop bulletin
was regarded as favorable, but its Influence
was offset by the renewed firmness in the cot
ton and erain markets.
Bonds were hravy, in sympathy with stocks.
Total sales, par value, $2,725,000. United
States bends were all unchanged on the last
cell.
NEW YORK. Aug. 4.â The stock market de
\-eloiH-d icute weakness again to-day, and after
liquidation throughout the cession, cloved ac
tive and weak at about the lowest for the day.
This rerresented also the lowest of the year
for a number of prominent stocks and near the
lowest for a much larger number. Union Pa
cific. AtchlEon. Erie. TÂ«xas Pacific, Wabash
preferred. Rock Island preferred. Consolidated
Ga*. Republic Stt*! and the Virginia-Carolina
Chemical etocks were among those which Bold
to-day lower than before this year. United
States Steel sold at 21. which Is the lowest
price on record. Th*re was an insignificant
rally In the final hour of the market, but the
eelllng wan renewed at the last. It was evi
dent that the process of selling cut collateral
In loans was resumed on a considerable scale.
The bource of the selling took on the myste
rious character of the recent period or liqui
dation, which lt was hoped had been com
pleted for the present. A number of stocks
broke sharply this morning on account of spe
cial news developments, and the renewal of
the . genera! declining tendency seemed to
prompt tbe liquidation as much as any other
factor.

I Prices fluctuated nervously' -the greater part
j of the day, but an unexpected advance In the
Northwest market with more damage reports
from that section, together ; with bullish re
ports from Europe, caused a strong tone late
in the "session and the close was near the top,
September closing at MiÂ»Â£c, a gain of %c, after
It had sold up to S0%'SS0V&c.
There was a moderate trade In corn and
priee % s were easier at the opening, due to fur
ther rains in the West. Tin; close was strong
with September %@%c higher, r.t O'JVi@32%c.
Disappointing threshing returns were largely
responsible for the firmness in oats, although
tho Ecarclty of offering's helped prices. Septem
ber closed U@?sc higher at .".4.14c.
Provisions were strong early, due to fyi ad
vance of from 5c to ITic in prices at .the yards,
but local traders sold on the advance and a
reaction followed. The close was a trifle
easier, with September pork 7^c lower, Sep
tember lard unchanged and ribs oft 214c.

The latest application of the principle
ofv the penny in the slot Is reported from
Australia. In the postofflces of the com
monwealth, if time or opportunity does
not permit the prompt purchase of a
stamp, the person In a hurry will lir fu
ture be able to drop his letter into one
orifice of a machine and his penny into
the other, and when this process is â¢com
pleted, "One penny paid." will be found
Impressed bn the envelope as an equiva
lent to the orthodox stamp. The innova
tion has its advantages. Attaching the
stamp to the envelope Is perhaps the
greatest nuisance connected with letter
writing. In spite of many sanitary warn
ings, the practice of "licking" is still con
siderably more the rule than the excep
tion.âNew York Commercial.

"Translating Is an art." said an In
structor at the university. "Carlyle
translated some fairy tales from the Ger
man, and these tales from TIeck and,
Musacus are examples of English prose
as beautiful as the heart could desire.
Swinburne translated Villon, and ao did
Rossetti, who gave us, furthermore, par
aphrases of the Italian poets that equal
the originals in charm. That is the test
of translationâ that it shall equal in
beauty the originalâ and I think there
should be a law requiring every great
writer to translate at least one great
book. But our good men can't afford to
make translations; the pay is too miser
able. It is impossible to get for translat
ing a novel of 125.000 words more than
about $250.. That Is only $2 per 1000 words
and there is no living in it at such fig
ures."âPhiladelphia Record.
Little Money in Translating.
The Hartfor Courant has started an
agitation . for the abolition of the term
"Wooden Nutmeg State," as applied to
Connecticut. The general opinion seems
to be that while the discussion is Interest
ing, from the academic standing it will
accomplish nothing. We are inclined to
think that it will accomplish a good deal.
We believe that it will cause the term to
be more generally used and accepted than
ever before. If the term ever had the real
significance the Courant assigns to It. It
was lost sight of years ago. Men whose
devotion to Connecticut is unquestioned
have been proud to wear the little nut
meg as an emblem at gatherings all over
the country. We venture to predict that
when the G. A. R. holds Its coming en
campment at San Francisco the Connecti
cut department will have on hand a large
supply of wooden nutmegs and these will
be most eagerly sought after as souven
irs. "W*e have attended a number of largs
conventions of, various kinds,' all over the
country, and we have noticed that the lit
tle nutmegs were always In great demand
and most highly prized. As a badge It
is neat, Ingenious and distinctive and we
can -see no good reason why any lover of
old Connecticut should waste his time and
energy in trying to establish a boycott
against It.â Utchfleld Enquirer.

i The Supervisor's Printing Committee

Company, to print 1500 municipal reports
for the fiscal years 1901-1902 and 1902-1903
at, 30 cents per. page and no charge for

â¢ The question of the legality of the ac
tion of the Board of Public Works In
abolishing the office of Chief - x of the
Bureau of Streets is to be tested in the
courts. Yesterday Benjamin Heath, who
formerly held the office, .filed a suit for
a writ of mandate, compelling the board
to reinstate him. He claims that the po
sition was under civil service and that
as no charges were preferred against
him, his removal was illegal.

Attorney General Approves Title.
Attorney General TJ. S. "Webb, in re
sponse to a request from Governor Par

the title to the Steffens residence property
in Sacramento, which the Capitol Com
missioners propose purchasing for a Gov
ernor's mansion. In accordance with a re->
cent act of the Legislature.
have procured the information from the parents
contained in the birth certificate, which. It la
claimed by counsel for the petitioners, was not
uÂ«d until the return of the mother the follow
ing year. Jfay 5, 1805. at which time It was
presented by the conspirators to secure the
landing of the fictitious daughter.
DENTAX OF PARENTS.
The opinion then goes on to say that
the father and mother denied ever having
seen the birth certificate before. But the
Commissioner found that the genuine
signature of Wong Lin In English was
attached to the certificate. Both parents,
however, denied that the signature was
genuine. On the following day the father
was recalled and admitted that he had
thought the matter over and that he had
been mistaken when he said that ' the
signature was not genuine.
The Commissioner added that in order
to assume that the story of the petitioners
was correct It would be necessary to be
lieve that the Chinese Consul, the steam
ship officials and all others involved were
members of a conspiracy against the pe
titioners. The Commissioner drove the
nail "home by adding:
Now this is what in fact actually took
place: Inspectors Lynch and Boyce called
upon the father and from the memorandum
signed by them at the time It appears that
the father stated that "Lum Shee is his wife
"and Wong Sew Tal is his daughter, and they
are now on the steamer Gaelic." This in Itself
exposes {the entire fallacy of the aj;ered con
spiracy. On its- face such a conspiracy is
wholly unreasonable.
The Commissioner next adverted to the
testimony of D. J. O'Leary. who made the
entries upon the departure record and
who swore positively that the entry con
cerning the scars on the girl's neck were
made by himself, and that Dick Williams
acted only as interpreter.
PERJURY ALL THROUGH;
The opinion then proceeds in the fol
lowing strong language:
In fact I am strongly Impressed that the
entire case on behalf of the girl Is perjury
from its Inception, and Illustrates what I
have had occasion to remark from my experi
ence in a large number of these Chinese cases,
that any number of Chinese witnesses can be
procured to testify to any fact it is desired
to establish; and that the testimony of white
witnesses whose principal business Is transacted
among Chinese must be received with great
caution.
If we take the records as recitlns the truth
In this case the matter Is very simple. The
mother did take back her daughter, who was
at that time 9 years of age and had the
scars as recorded by Mr. O'Leary at the time
of their departure and that such girl returned
with her mother and was duly landed on May
11. 1S05; that the letter written by the sec
retary of the Chinese Consul was fcona fide:
that he was not a party to any conspiracy
with Dick Williams: and that in fact there
was no such conspiracy and that these people
are now fraudulently attempting to land this
thirteen-year-old girl as the daughter taken
to China by the mother on April 10. 1S94, not
expecting that the records, some eljrht years
old. would bi discovered .and produced against
them.
The Commissioner ordered that the girl
be remanded for deportation to China-
Attorney McGowan stated that he would
take the case to the United States Cir
cuit Court of Appeals.

the Union-street line, in reference to a
statement that President Cornelius of the
Carmen's Union had made that the Union
street line was willing to pay its plat

Newhall testified that he believed that
his brother, Georce A. Xewhall. earlier
in the year, had held a conversation with
President Cornelius and had agTeed to
pay the carmen of the' Union-street line
$3 a. day. commencing from the 1st of
May, if the United Railroads would pay
the same amount.
'"Had you any expectation that the car
rr.en would work for less for you than
for the United Railroads?" asked Liver
rash.
"I think they might," replied Newhall.
At this reply L'.vernash dismissed New
hall from the stand with a show, of tem

at once raised an objection to Livernash's
remarks.

The Civil Service Commission filed its
annual report for the fiscal year ending
June 30. 19O3.\with the Mayor yesterday.
The report says that since January last
nine examinations have been held, mak
ing ten for the fiscal year. ; The commis
sion points with pride to the saving of
$6000 per year In the expenses of the Tax
Collector's office, which it claims Is due
directly to the employment in that office
of none but civil service men. On this
point the reports continues:
This result would not have been possible
without the excellent business management of
the Tax Collector, but he admits that if his
clerks were the product of- political patronage
not only is it certain that the saving of $b(W0
would have "been absolutely impossible but th.9
increase of his appropriation rather than its
reduction would have been probable.
The report also directs attention to a
letter from Registrar Walsh, who says
that since the operation of civil service
the average cost of elections .has been
reduced from $200,000 to $113,000. The re
port /ells of the litigation In which the

Expert Cyril Williams of the Board of
Supervisors filed a report yesterday with
Mayor Schmitz to the effect that there
is a shortage of $300 in the teachers' an
nuity and retirement fund.
Williams finds that the amounts re
ceived by the Treasurer and credited to
the annuity fund agree with those desig
nated In the minutes and entered in the
annuity books, with one exception. At
the meeting of the Commissioners held
on January 19. 1S97. two teachers were re
tired, each being instructed to pay $300
to the credit of the annuity fund, name
\i\ Mrs. Josephine Gerichten and Miss
Elizabeth M^ Molloy. Mrs. Gerichten's
subscription was paid and placed to her
credit on January 19, 1S97.
The amount due from Mrs. Molloy, the
report continues, does not appear on the
Treasurer's books, but on Inquiry Miss
Molloy stated that she holds a receipt
for $300 from the then Treasurer Wid
ber. signed by Deputy M. de la Montanya
under date of January 28, 1897. Williams
has written to Montanya. who is not In
the city, to ask if he can throw any light
on the subject. The report says the fol
lowing matters concerning the fund re
quire attention: .
A proper accounting of the contributions by
teachers.
The recovery of the amount of $000 depos
ited by Miss Molloy.
A list of annuitants to be made out and
sworn to Quarterly.
Adjustment of the permanent fund In ac
cordance with the receipts.
DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE.
The following are extracts from the
opinion: -'-'--Â¦'
In order to support the claim of the con
spiracy we must believe* that the following
sups were taken by the conspirators:
First, that Dick Williams, having been em
ployed by Wong Lln to prepare the papers for
the departure of his wife and daughter to
China, and having learned from the parents
that the mother Intended leaving eaid daughter
In China and returning alone, conceived the
scheme to fraudulently Import into the United
States a girl as the daughter of these people;
that. In pursuance of such scheme, he caused
the words "accompanies with her daughter, Sul
Hi, about 9 years," to be written upon the pa
perB which he prepared and which were to be
used by the mother In securing her landing at
San Francisco upon her return. â¢ â¢ â¢
The next step to be taken by Williams was
at the Mall dock upon the sailing of the vessel
upon which the mother and daughter departed:
that Williams, acting an Chinese interpreter,
caused the entry of . departure of the girl to
read "9 years of age" and bearing certain large
scars on the neck, instead of about 3 years and
rÂ» months and no such marks of identification.
Why did Dick Williams cause an entry to bo
made containing particular marks of Identifica
tion? This forces us to the conclusion, if we
are to maintain the theory of conspiracy, that
at the time Dick Williams wrote In the false
writing upon the affidavits aforesaid, and
caused the false entry and identification marks
to be made on the departure record, and pro
cured the fabricated birth (for It appears that
the birth certificate was procured before the
departure in 18t>4) that he intended to import
Into thla country a girl who would answer these
particular Identification marks and age, so that
we must conclude that the description of the
girl he Intended to so import was known to him
before the departure of the" mother, although
the mother remained In China for more than
one year. lie must also at the same time
In an exhaustive written opinion read
yesterday United States Court Commis
sioner Heacock .expressed his opinion of,
the worthlessnesa of Chinese testimony
and the unreliability of the testimony of
persons connected with Chtn/ese in busi
ness matters. The opinion was delivered
in the matter of the habeas corpus writ
issued on behalf of Wonjr Sew Tal, a
girl claiming to be a native of San Fran
cisco. .The putative father Is Wong Lin.
manager of the Oro Flno Cigar Factory.
The mother is Lum Shee, his second wife.
Wong Lln has three wives, the first liv
ing in China, the third in this city.
The mother, Lum Shee, took the girl,
Wong Sew Tai, to China, leaving here
April 10, 1S94, and returned on May 6, 1895,
with the same girl that she had taken
away. According to the birth certificate
on file in the Chinese bureau, the girl
would be 18 years old now. The father
went back to China and returned a few
weeks ago with a boy and a girl, which
he claims to be the Identical Wong Sew
Tai that the 'mother took away in 1S94.
She is only 13 years old.
George McGowan, attorney for the par
ents, produced Chinese and white wit
nesses to prove that the 13-year-old appli
cant was the girl that went to China with
her mother In 1894 and never returned un
til a few weeKs ago. He attempted to
show that the records of -the Chinese bu
reau had been falsified by Dick Williams,
at one time a Chinese Interpreter con
nected with the bureau, and who was
afterward Indicted by the Federal Grand
Jury for crooked practices, and falsified
for the purpose of bringing in the girl
that arrived on the same steamer with
the mother In 1S95.
