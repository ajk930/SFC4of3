When General Miles was asked if he

"We stand ready to take up the fran
chises of these roads, which I. understand
some Southern Pacific official said were
not profitable," asserted Maguire. "We
are ready to satisfy the committee of
fifty that we are responsible and can
furnish a better service than the South
ern Pacific Is now giving Alameda. Her
man Epplnger, R. B. Mott and Eastern
capitalists are ready and willing to oper
ate these lines either by steam power
or by electricity. We will guarantee to
start work within TTJirty days after ob
taining th'e franchises."
The second application . was from the
American Surface Electric Railway and
Supply Company, E. J. Russell president

company offered no bonus for the fran
chise, Maguire explaining that the con
cern would do so if the privilege was ad
vertised and opened to competitive bid
ders. Â¦
One application was from Robert B.
Mott of Alameda and Herman Epplnger
Jr. of San Francisco, who former Con

A feature of to-day was the cross-ex

for the defense, by Tom.D. Marcum, one
of the attorneys. for the prosecution- and

prosecution as to his actions on that fate
ful day. .'.; y.
Curtis Jett, one of the defendants, was
placed on the stand. He said that he
was friendly to J. B. Marcum, and with
the exception of a few words with him
some four years ago they had always
been friendly. Jett said after the shots
were fired he walked into the courthouse
and looked about, but, seeing nothing, re
turned by the side door, the way he
came, and went across the street. Jett
said he saw Ewen running around the
courthouse. A few minutes after this he
saw Tom White. on the street.' and with
njm went down town to a place near the
depot, where they crossed the river and
visited his grandmother Hargls mother
xif Judge Hargls. and there " had "dinner.
He said he met Mrs. Mary Johnson, who
asked him if he had killed her brother.
He told her he did not, but that they
would accuse him of it.
"I am sorry to be arrested on Sunday,
as I would not be taken to Winchester if
arrested another day. ' I could be taken to.
jail to Jackson, where I would j be all
right." .; .;Â¦'
Witness said he asked Jett where he
was when the killing occurred, and Jett
replied, "None of your business."
W. H. Blanton. who was recalled by the
prosecution, testified that In a conversa
tion with Captain Ewen the day after the
shooting of Marcum, Ewen told him who
did the killing.

WITH GENDARMES
The fugitive clerk was arrested several
months afterward In Victoria, . B. C. He
had been working on the Canadian Rail
way as-a porter, and his whereabouts
was made known to the United States of
flfcra by a horseshoe diamond pin which
Dillard had worn for luck.- Before leav
ing this city he pawned- the pin in a
pawnshop on Montgomery street, where
it was discovered "by United States Secret
Service Agent George W. Hazen, who
had been making. a,systematic senrch in
the pawnshops of this city for the same
pin, knowing that. Dillard did not have
much money when he departed. Hazen
claimed the pin, but allowed It to remain
In possession of the pawnbroker, . because
he 6uspected' that the fugitive would send
for it. At the end of one of his trips
Dillard sent money for the redemption of
the pin and ordered It forwarded to a cer
tain address In Seattle. Internal Revenue
Agent Thomas had the pin followed to its
destination, after which it was traced to
Victoria, where It was delivered to the
UNLUCKY HORSESHOE.
Shortly after the receipt of this intelli
gence Dillard Informed Collector Lynch
that he was about to go on his vacation.
The time expired, but no word was re
ceived from the clerk, and when an Inves
tigation was had Collector Lynch and
United States . Internal Revenue Agent
Bert M. Thomas felt themselves justitied
in asking United States District Attorney
Marshall B. Woodworth to procure the
indictment of Dillard.

Dillard was a messenger in the office
during j the administration of Collector
Osca M. Welburn. He was used as one
of the principal witnesses for the Govern
ment In the criminal proceedings insti
tuted against Welburn for embezzlement
of Government, funds. After the first trial
of Welburn. Dttlard was promoted to a
clerksnip under the new Collector. John
C. Lynch, with an increase of salary. He
was much brighter than the average of
his people and performed his duties in a
satisfactory manner. About, a year ago
Mr. Lynch was informed by United States
Internal revenue officers In New Mexico,
Texas and other places along the border
that they had found In possession of Chi
nese laborers certificates of residence
which appeared to be fraudulent and
forged and that they bore what purported
td be the signatures of John C. Lynch and

The strike leaders attribute the failure
to the stringent measures taken by the

Mr. Shortrldge did not neglect to sound
the jurors as to the existence of race
prejudice on their part. "You are aware
of the. fact." he said, "that the defend
ant Is a negro. As a result of your read-
Ing or experience have you any preju
dice acalnst the negro as a race which
would affect you as a juror? You would
give him the same benefit of a reason
able doubt as you would a member of
your, own race? Would you deal with
him as you would be dealt by?"
These questions were answered In a
Fatlsfactory manner and a Jury was se
cured before noon. After the noon re
cess Mr. Woodworth made a statement
to the jury as to. what the Government
expected to prove, and Collector John C.
Lynch was called as a witness. He de
scribed In detail the manner of Issuing
the duplicate certificates of registration
of Chinese laborers. He said that when
a Chinese person made application for a
duplicate the witness used to compare
the photograph and appearance of the ap
plicant with the photograph and descrip
tion on the diiDllcate certificate retained
in the office, and If convinced that the
applicant was the person to whom the
missing original had been issued he
O K'd the application. Then It was
handed to Dillard, who had exclusive
charge of the duplicates In the safe and
whose duty it was exclusively to make

shown to the . witness, who Identified the
handwriting of DIUard upon/ them and
testified that the signature of "John C.

had not authorized Dillard or any other
person to sign the Lynch name to the cer
tificates mentioned or to any other cer

Special Dispatch . 'to The Call.
Secretary Root, in. his indorsement of
the opinion of the Judge advocate general.
says:
I suppose there is no doubt that a manufac
turing; firm, one member of which happens to
be a membfr of Congress, has a, right to manu
facture and sell goods to Jobbers who are fill
ing Government contracts and that they do not
come within the prohibition of the statute so
long as the contract between the firm and the
jobber Is a separate and distinct transaction
from the contract between the Jobber and the.
Government. There appears to be no evtdenco
that in the manufacture of gloves by the
Messrs. Llttaur Bros., to be u*ed in filling Gov
ernment contracts made by Lyon and others,
there was any violation of the statute excepting
one case, the contract of December 7. ISM. It
is not the iluty or the right of the Secretary
of War to adjudicate that case or to determine
whether the statute was or was not violated
except in so far aa it may bo necessary for him
to decide what action, if any. should be taken
by- the War Department. In view of the facts
disclosed. I think the Indications of an Inter
est by the manufacturing firm la the Jobbers'
contract with the Government are sufficient
to require me to proceed upon the theory that
there is a rrima facie case of violation of the
statute. Â¦Â¦'*Â¦:Â¦Â¦
A case falling within the prohibition of the
statute Is clearly shown In the testimony,
which, in the opinion of this officer, charges
the department with tha performance of the
duty Â«et forth In section 3733 of the Revised
Statutes: and it Is. therefore, recommended
that a demand be made by the quartermaster
general upon the firm of Littauer Bros, for
the repayment of whatever sum is found to
hare been paid in consideration of the contract
of December 7, 1S0S. with E. It. Lyon. as ex
tended, in accordance with Us terms by thÂ«
quartermaster's department.
General Davi: .ecommends that the tes
timony of two witnesses who could not be
found by Inspector Carllngton is rather
Important and that the investigation be
continued with a view of getting their tes
timony. When taken, he says, it can be
referred to the Department of Justice
with the other papers In the case.
Some discussion having arisen as to the prtca
which Lyon was to pay for gauntlets delivered
under the contract of December 7. an agree
ment wai entered Into by Littauer Eros, and
Lyon to the effect that an accurate account of
the cost of manufacture- was to be kept, and
If. after the contract were completed. It should
prove that the cost of manufacture did not
equal $1 65 per pair. Lyon waa to receive one
half of the profits. There was a profit of $3137.
one-half of which was credited to Lyon en
the books of Littauer Bros.
Colonel Carllngton of the inspector gen
eral's department was directed by Secre
tary Root to make an Investigation, which,
he did, taking testimony and submitting â¢
a report as to the facts In, the case. This
report and the testimony were" referred to
Judge Advocate General Davis, who mado
an extensive review and submitted an
opinion to Secretary Root. In his report
and opinion General Davis says:
It Â«vpÂ«ars from the testimony that on Octo
ber 15. 1898.' a contract waa awarded to Lyon
for 3000 pairs of rauskrat gloves at $1 04 per
pair: on December 7. 1S98. a second contract
for 20,000 pairs waa awarded to Lyon at U TO
per pair, a stipulation belnir Inserted to the ef
fect that deliveries under It could be tncrÂ«as*a
60 per cent at the discretion of the officer
making the contract. Tha Government took
advantage of the stipulation and 3O,0rtl pairs
were actually called for and delivered under
the contract of December T. 18Â»8.
' "WASHINGTON, Aug. 3.â Secretary Root
to-day made public all of the papers re
latins to the investigation into the Gov
ernment contract for gloves with E. R.
Lyon. This contractor procured gloves
from Littauer Bros., the senior member
of the firm, I* N. Littauer. beins a mem
ber of Congress. Secretary Root has re
ferred the case to the Department of Jus
tice, in order that it may be ascertained if
the law has been violated, and, if so, that"
appropriate measures may be taken in
the premises. There is a statute .which,
prohibits contracts for the Government
being made either directly or Indirectly
with aÂ» member of Congress, and this was
the basis for the investigation by the War
Department.

Conflicting Tales
Vex the Active
Officers of Law
Cardinal Herrero is being treated by
Dr. Lapponl and nursed by his fellow
Cardinals, besides his conclavists. King
Alfonso of Spain has telegraphed to his
Embassador inquiring as to the condi
tion of the Cardinal.
The Osservatore Romano, the organ of
the Vatican, officially announces that Car
dinal Herrero y Espinosa, being gravely
111. has received the last communion. Mon
slgnor Boniface JIarin, the Vicar Gen
eral of his archdiocese (Valencia), was
admitted to the conclave to-day, the door
being opened for that purpose with all
the prescribed precautions. Outside were
the Governor and Marstr.il of the con
clave, assisted by captains ot the guard.
The Apostolic Prothenotarles and the son
of Prince Chigi acted as witnesses. In
side the door when It was opened were
Monslgnor Merry del Val, secretary of
the consistory; Monsigor Roggi. prefect
of r ceremonies, and Monaignor Marzollni.
The record of the admittance of Monslg
nor Marin was officially recorded in a
formal document, which will be placed in
the archives.
CARDINAL HEBBERO DYING.
Among the Embassadors and ecclesias
tics there exists a general opinion that,
if only for the sake of saving the aged
Cardinals, much may be sacrifled within
the conclave to arrive at a speedy con
clusion. On the other hand there are a
few pessimistic enough to believe tHat
the hostility among the factions in the
Sacred College is so bitter that the. strug
gle may be continued for several weeks.
Out of all the rumors and gossip afloat
concerning what is transpiring In the con
clave the most persistent report Is to tho
effect that the Rampolla and Seraflno Van
nutelli factions have remained compact
and that the attempt of one faction to
press forward a. new candidate In the
hope of breaking the strength of the
other has failed. The Italia says that
matters have reached a point which pre
sages the possibility of the election of a
foreign Pope and that Cardinal Kopp.
Bishop of Breslau. who is most frequent
ly mentioned in this connection, has the
support of the German Emperor. If this
is true, the Italia interprets it as a move
on the part of the Rampolla faction to
win over the Austro-German Cardinals
from Seranno VannutellL â¢
IHO BREAK IN" FACTIONS.
Rome Is becoming extremely impatient
over the delay in the selection of the new
Pope, concerning which there appears to
be no definite expression, owing to the
rigid secrecy with which thÂ© proceedings
within the conclave are being guarded.
To-day practically the only news that
came from the Slstlne Chapel was that
of the extremely grave illness of Cardinal
Herrero. It is presumed, however, that
the other aged Cardinals also are suffer
ing from their prolonged incarceration
and the Intense heat.
ROME. Aug. 3.â After three full daya
of deliberation, during which six ballots
have been taken, the members of the
conclave still remain shut up in the Vat
ican without having selected a successor
to LÂ«o XIII. Tha futility of both the
ballots taken to-day was evidenced by
the smoke which arose from the Slstina
Chapel. This mute signal Â»hls evening
was watched by a large crowd, which
partly filled the Square- of San Pletro,
and which, it was estimated, numbered
about 15,000. Great disappointment was
manifested, and when the little puff of
'smoke appeared there were loud cries,
not only of disappointment, bat even' of
derision. J â¢ Â¦ .

. "The Filipinos are being drilled by

gone over to the rebels, and some whites

tity at a Ranch.
VISIT OF FUGITIVES^
It is generally agreed that convicts
Case and Seavls at least are still in the
neighborhood of Webber Creek. Jolly be
lieves that more outlaws yet are wan
dering around in the same section. This
locality has been searched for five days
by different posses with no success.
Guards began work at daylight and toiled
until noon when they returned to Lotus
for dinner. A long conference was held
after which the wearied searchers rested.
Great secrecy was maintained about
maneuvers, as most of the leaders in the
great manhunt are certain that outside
aid and Information have been furnished
the convicts. At twilight guards set out
from Euhlenkamp's store for the cross
road three miles south of Lotus. The
plan is to station two men In eight lonely
houses in Webber Creek district In hope
of catching the convicts who may call.
in their hunt for escaped con
victs. The posse of sixteen men
was divided this morning into detach
ments of two 1>r three men each and hills
around Orellis and Jurgen's postofflce
were diligently patrolled, but results were
not encouraging. Tracks were found at
various points and some were thought
to be those of outlaws.

Webber Creek Soil
Shows Traces of
Traveling Felons
So with a report that the body of a
convict had been found near Auburn this
morning. Investigation showed that this
was founded on the report made in Pla
cerville yesterday that one of the con
victs who had ambushed the militia had
been found on the hill near the Grand
Victory mineÂ» The report from Placer-'
ville reached Auburn and in coins: from
one person to another it was distorted.
Ajsearch is being made of the hill where
the soldiers were ambushed in order to
see if one of the convicts Is lying dead
there, but so far no signs have been dis
covered. Every possible Â¦ outlet from El
Dorado County is carefully guarded by
600 armed men, but there Is still the pos
sibility of the murderers who killed the
two soldiers slipping through the lines.
VEXATIONS FOR POSSES.
The air Is still filled with rumors of
all kinds and the work of the Sheriffs
and posses is most arduous. Every ru
mor and report that comes In has to be
Investigated, for otherwise it would seem
as if the entire malodorous population of
Folsom prison was at large.
An instance of the hard work of the
Sheriffs is shown by the report that came
In here from Dutch Flat late last night
that shots had been exchanged between
the posse and two convicts near Dutch
Flat Cemetery. Sheriff Keena of Placer
County rode with his posse all night from
Lotus to Dutch Flat, while another posse
sped over the road from Auburn in order
to be In the expected battle this morn
ing. Early news from Dutch Flat this
morning showed that there was nothing
whatever In last night's report that a
convict had been wounded and one of
the posse shot.
"Red Shirt" Gordon has not been seen
since be dropped away from the band of
thirteen murderers when Guard Ryan of
Folsom prison fired on> the outlaws at
Mormon Island bridge. Gordon is prob
ably in hiding by this "time in some large
city.
Still three more of the convicts are
thought to be on the middle fork of the
American* River, northeast of the Span
ish Dry Diggings, which are near the
Placer County line. One of the convicts
is probably in . Nevada to-day, as all re
ports indicate that one of the outlaws
worked his way clean across El Dorado
County and struck out on the Tahoe road.
GORDON ENTIRELY LOST.
culations of the events of the past few
days, five of the convicts who ambushed
the militia at the Grand Victory mine are
somewhere on the middle fork of the Co
sumnes River southwest of the town of
Grizzly Flat. The convicts Seavls and
Case are still in the region of the Web
ber Creek district, where the creek runs
into the south fork of the American Riv
er. These desperadoes, one of whom is
the notorious and bloodthirsty negro,
were seen Saturday night about four miles
due 'east of Salmon Falls. They took
dinner at the Chapman ranch and ad
mitted their identity.

PLACERVILLE, Aug. S.â Flags
are at halfmast and an air of
mourning pervades this city on
account of the untimely end-
Ing, of Festus Rutherford and
GrifHth Jones, the two members
of Company H of the Second Regiment,
National Guard of California, who so
bravely met death whileMiuntlng for some
of the escaped felons from Folsom prison
last Saturday.
The bodies of the two men were viewed
by hundreds of people yesterday at the
undertaking . establishment of Coroner
WInchell. This morning Captain Wlster
of the militia mounted a guard of honor
and this guard* will be maintained during
the night. The body of Rutherford was
removed from Placerville this morning to
his mother's home at Missouri Flat, as
she and her children desired to have the
remains of their loved one In the home
for one night before the interment is
held. Jones* body remains at the Cor
oner's office and unless word is received
to-day from Jones' wife, from whom he
was separated, the militia company will
carry out Its plans and give the remains
a military funeral. The wife of Jones
and her little girl live in San Francisco,
but no one has been able to locate them.
The body of Rutherford will be buried
to-morrow morning and that of Jones In
the afternoon. Brief services will be held
at the Rutherford home and the body will
then be brought to Placerville, where It
will be met by the militia company and
members of the Fraternal Brotherhood.
Services will be held at- the Methodist
Episcopal church and the Rev. George T.
King will officiate. The funeral will be
a military one and all honors will be ren
dered to the dead hero. The Interment
will be at Union Cemetery. Tfie funeral
of Jones will take place in the afternoon
and military honors will be a tribute to
the heroic young man who gave his life
while serving as a volunteer to enforce
the law. .The body of Philip Stringer has
been taken care of by his friends and the
funeral of the man who was accidentally
shot will be private.
The outlaws traveled most of the day
and ,night following their departure from
Hanks' Exchange over the roughest kind
of country and arrived at a point a mile
and a half from the Copper Lead mine at
10:30 o'clock last night.
They visited the cabin of George Esty,
commonly known as "Dutch Henry," and
held him up at the point of a rifle. He
was compelled to prepare a meal for the
desperadoes, who ate heartily. After sup
per thev went .through the old man's
house and took practically everything he
possessed. Warning him that he would
be killed If he should report . the affair,
they strode, off in the darkness up the
bed of the river, whicn is nearly dry at
this season of the year. .
Seavis, the negro, was not in the gang,
and as he was- seen at, Chapman's only
a few hours after the fight it ; is certain
that he. was not with tne men who killed
the militiamen, as was at first thought. .
News of the hold-up in the neigbbor-
force of twenty men. I believe that we
will have a brisk fight."
Norman was with Deputy Sheriff Thom
as Jackson of Amador at the Evans and
Sonntag round-up. Jackson is one "of the
best known gunflghters and trailers in
California. He has a wooden foot, which,
however, does not impede his mountain
work materially. He is as happy as a
clam at high tide to get into so lively a
hunt, and asserts that he will come back
with some scalps.

about having aeen any posses, but were
on their guard, and were avoiding all

Amador Sheriff
and His Posse
Expect a Battle
"There is no road to that village and
the convicts must have taken a mountain
trail if they did not keep along. the river
bed. There are no houses to speak of
beyond the Fiat, and if the outlaws are
careful /they can get to the hills and over
into Nevada. They can grub stake most
any day, shooting game. Besides there
will not be any one who will tackle the
Job of hunting them in the mountains.
It is worse than looking for a needle in
a haystack. They came " down from
the Copper mine. to Fair Play, and then
up to Somerset, where he ran into me."
O. H. McCoughey, manager of a gold
mine two miles up the Cosumnes from
the Copper Lead mine, has been In Pla
cerville' for a. week,, and was much ex
cited yesterday when . he heard - that the
desperadoes wereV heading toward his
camp."- His wife and children and twenty
-employes are at "the mine and are In no
,way prepared to protect themselves from
the outlaws. McCoughey Bays that his
people will have sense enough to feed
reckless murderers if they, arrive and he
will make no objection if half the camp
Is carried away into the Sierras.
REGION VERY ROUGH.
"IÂ»cot into Somerset early this morn-
Ing and saw Dick Lyons riding horse
back 'down the road like mad. He shout
ed that he was coming for help to get
the escaped convicts who stood up and
robbed "Dutch Henry" a mile and a half
below the Copper Lead mine on the Co
sumnes River. He was after Sheriff Nor
man and four other men from Amador
County, who spent last night a^Bakers
Bar, and- who intended to make Grizzly
Flat to-day to. head off the convicts.
"Lyons said that the outlaws knocked
at the door of his cabin and when he
appeared they told him to dig up some
grub and be auick about it. They held
a sun on him while he cooked supper.
After they had eaten they went through
the shack. and gobbled up blankets, food
and even a lot cf clothes. They said they
were convicts. They lay around half an
hour or so and then took on up the Mid
dle Fork of the Cosumnes toward Grizzly
Flat.'

"Dr. Piercs's Golden Medical Discovery
seems to take the place of hard training in
developing strength, vigor and endurance
of the system and expelling all impurities,
with which the blood sometimes gets
clogged. I have found by personal experi-
ence that it enables me to do more hard
work, and at the same time endure more
physical strain and partake with greater
vim in outdoor sports than anything I
know of. It can always be relied upon
to increase the appetite, induce healuful
sleep, and tone and refresh a worn-out
system.
"A number of my friends who have osed
it speak in the same high terms, and we
have reason to consider it an office man's
friend."
Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery
is a blood - purifier and health - giving
tonic that contains no alcohol, opium or

of the Outdoor Art Club for
The people of the coast side will give
the projects their moral and financial sup
port. Messrs. Clsrk and Bowie are deeply
interested in the matter and predict a
great future for the coast side. Already
they have had preliminary surveys made,
presenting to-day to the inspection of the
board a map of the proposed routes made
by Engineer E. F. Haas, who was present
to explain them.
They agree that if they shall be award
ed the franchises work will . be com
menced as soon as practicable, though
.the ordinance will give them two years In
which to commence work. By its terms'
they must construct at least five miles of
track each year until final completion or
forfeit all rights under their franchise.
COAST FOLK WILLING.
Mr. Bowje Is well known as a wealthy
and conservative business man. Mr. Clark
is a roeent comer to this county, but
has already invested heavily In real
estate in and about San Mateo. having
rome time ago purchased the property
formerly owned by Walter Hobart. He is
the ton of the millionaire copper king.
Senator Clark, and has unlimited backing
in any enterprise he may venture upon.
If built the roads will open up one of
the most fertile spots In the State, justly
railed the "Jordan of San Francisco."
The electric line will follow the course
of the present county road, crossing the
Crystal Springs Lake. The steam road
will run farther south and instead of
crossing the Sake will be constructed
around it. From this point on to Half
moon Bay the general course will be the
same.
By the terms of the franchises ordered
advertised no portion of the roads will
be used except where it becomes neces
sary' to cross them. A number of times
in the Da6t companies have been formed
to construct a coast railroad, but in each
case obstacles have been encountered
which led to the abandonment of the en
terprise. This time, however, the people
are assured that if it Is feasible to build
a road it will be constructed.
COUNTY ROADS SAFE.
The Supervisors were all favorable to
the proposed routes and -directed their
clerk to advertise the franchises for^ale,
fixing September 7 as the time when they
would receive bids for the same. At the
laÂ«t meeting of the board these two gen
tlemen presented applications for fran
chises, but at that time the board desired

Janice Meredith was greeted on the
second night of its production by a full
auditorium of appreciative people who
enjoyed the humor of the .play and ap
plauded the heroic passages with equal
gusto. Lillian Kemble shows at her best
as Janice, the playful moods alternating
with the serious phases affording her the
required opportunity of displaying her
mettle. In both the grave and the gay
she was at home. She is well supported
by Elsie Esmond, one of the best sou
brettes ever seen at the California. The
two compose a team of grace, wit and
beauty that it would be difficult to match.
The hero, George Soule Spencer, grows
more into favor with the audience for his
manly style of acting - and won much
merited applause last night. A clever
bit of dialect Is furnished by Joseph
Dalley, who in fact -redeemed the play
from what " would otherwise have been
a dangerous approach to flatness. That
old time favorite Irish character, James
M. Ward, appears to advantage as the
father, of the incomparable comedian,
Frank MacVicars.

HONOLULU, Aug. 3.â The local political
situation is likely to be complicated by
the action, to-day of the -Republican Cen
tral Committee, which decided to hold
open primaries for the county election. It
is probable -that a third ticket, proposed
as a citizens' reform movement, will be
placed in the field. The Home Rulers,
consltlng mainly of natives, have already
gone into the campaign, and lt is asserted
that the Hawaiians and half-whites have
announced their Intention' of capturing
the Republican organization In addition
to attending to their own political inter
ests. If the Home Rulers triumph at the
polls the county will "be ruled by natives,
and if the Hawaiians secure the Republi
can organization they will' nominate a
mixed ticket of natives, half- whites and
whites who are friendly to them. The
citizens' ticket is proposed to obviate the
possibility of turning over all the offices
to the natives.
Decision Arrived At by Central Com
mittee of the Party May Com
plicate the Situation.
HONOLULU REPUBLICANS
TO HOLD OPEN PRIMARIES
! The Central Theater scored another suc
cess last night in Edwin Arden's powerful
Russian drama ",Zorah." Standing-room
was at a premium, and the play, founded
on a story of the persccutlqns of the chil
dren of the Hebrew race In the, land of
the Czar, created a large amount of en
thusiasm. The stage setting. of "Zorah"
Is unusually fine, the bazaar of antiquities
being a scene of Oriental splendor, and
the scene in the Siberian mines of striking
realism. Herschel MayalV' made an Ideal
Rabbi Francos. The rabbi is a physician
as well as a priest, and in the mines to
which a tyrannical Governor has con
demned him and his affianced wife, Zorah,
he performs marvelous cures during, an
epidemic of the plague. â¢ The Governor
child is stricken by the dread malady.
The rabbi is sent for as a last resort. He
sees his chance to be avenged on the en
emy who has broken his life, but. Zorah
pleads' the child's cause and he buries his
hatred and brings the little tme back from
the door Â¦ of Â¦ death. Miss Eugenia Thais
Lawton gave an Impersonation of Zorah;
that was convincingly effective. The cast
Is a very long one. To Henry Shumer as
the Governor, of I Moscow, however, more
than passing mention la due. Edwin T.
Emery has a capital part.In Mr.,Slaugh
ter, and Miss Myrtle Vane Is delightful
as Miss Smith of Chicago. These two
furnish-the comedy of the piece! "Zorah"
is , a -great attraction and will Â»â¢ run to
crowded houses all the week.
Central.
Griffith and Anna Wilksâ contribute their
quota to . the success of the piece, and
the drills of the pretty chorus girls con
tinue a pleasing feature of the produc
tion. . Â¦ . :
The. delightful comedy -"The Butter
flies," by Henry Guy Carletonâ first pre
sented here by John Drew and his com
panyâwas the attraction at the Alcazar
â¢ Theater last night. The piece was beau
tifully staged *nd Its production by the
clever stock company left almost noth
ing to be desired. It has more than one
good moral lesson in showing that there
is something to live for in this world
besides money, and that' pride can be
humbled by unheralded generosity. White
Whittlesey. as Frederick Ossian. was a
whole-souled lover and the part suited
him admirably. Bertha Creighton as
Miriam was lovable and charming be
cause she was natural. George ' Os
bourne was Hiram Green, who made hla
millions without any schooling, and his
work was artistic and effective. Harry
S. Hilllard in the ungracious part of
Barrington, his son, was clever and con
vincing. Charles Wyngate caricatured
the part of Andrew Strong, the wealthy
young Englishman, to such an extent as
to make it ludicrous. Oza Waldrop was
bewitching as Suzanne Ellse and Miss
Marie Howe as Mrs. Beverly Stuart-
Dodge and Miss Eleanor Gordon as Mrs.
Ossian were excellent. Fr,ank Bacon had
an uncongenial part as Roscoe Bllser.

"Should, however. Dr. Bollard take his
grievances "to the secular courts he would
probably find as little sympathy there as
he has so far in the Judicial bodies ap
pointed by church authority. In every in
stance where aggrieved clergymen have
appealed to the courts from canonical de
cisions of the church it has been decided
against them. Decisions affecting precisely
identical circumstances as the Bollard
case have always been to the effect that
clergy of a church are subject to Its law*
presuming that the canons governing the
discipline of that church have been right
ly observed."
What Dr. Bollard's next move will be is
not known.
A rumor is current among those clergy
men and others Interested in the proceed

that, the recalcitrant clergyman has been

from the Judgment of the court that ac
quitted the Bishop on all counts at the
trial in May last. The ruling 'of the Pre

charges was fairly conducted and its de
cision not subiect to review.
A member of the court said: "That is
the only possible decision under the cir
cumstances; in fact, there Is no one who
could either grant a new trial or reverse
the verdict of the first one. Aa far as tho
church is concerned, the case is con

DIAMONDâ A. O. S.. City. For many
years the Koh-i-noor held the lank of be
ing the most famous diamond in the
world. In the rough It weighed 900 carats,
but now after various cuttings it weighs
but 106 carats. It is said that a diamond
discovered by Captain Ed Jorgensen Jn
South Africa, and which was sent to Am
sterdam to be cut and polished, weighed
in the rough 971 carats. It has bÂ«en named
the Excelsior. The largest prior to the
finding of the Excelsfor was the one in tba
possession of the Rajah of Mattan, weigh
ing 367 caxat3. It is not known what the
Excelsior will weigh when cut. The price
of diamonds varies according to the sup
ply and change of fashions, but the gen
eral rule to ascertain the value of a gem.
is te square the number of carats the- dia
mond weighs and then to multiply by tbo
price of a single carat: thus, a diamond
of 12 carats. A single carat is worth, say,.
$10; the diamond would be valued at 12
times 12 times 10, equaling $1440.
CAPITAL, PUNISHMENTâ Subscriber,
City. In many of the German states
capital punishment has been abolished, in
Brunswick, Coburg. Oldenberg: and in
Nassau in 1349; in Saxe Meinlngen and
Saxe Weimar in 1862; in Baden in 1S63. and
in Saxony in 1SG8. But it was restored by
the Imperial Criminal Code in 1S72 in the
case of the life of the Emperor or of the
sovereign of any federal state in which
the offender happened to be. and . for de-.
liberate homicide. The various states are
allowed to choose their own instruments
of death. In the old provinces of Prus

in the kingdom of Saxony the guillotine

1S51. but they are now conducted privately

that he was naturalized would not confer

The duty incumbent upon the press and upon the
public to see to it that public administration is care
fully' and honestly performed carries with it not only
an obligation to condemn the inefficient and untrust
worthy, but also that of giving proper and public
recognition to those officials who have deserved well
of the people by reason of the excellence of their
work. In this case the fact that Tax Collector Smith,
Treasurer McDougall and Auditor Baehr are all Re
publicans will of course be gratifying to other Re
publicans from a partisan point of view, but the issue
is larger than that of partisanship. Municipal ad-,
ministration is mainly a matter of business that af
fects the immediate interests of all members of the
community, and consequently the commendation of
the good work done by the Tax Collector, the Auditor
and the Treasurer should come from their constit
uents generally regardless of party ties.
Having made up the record of the past fiscal .year
with a smaller delinquent tax list than ever before,
despite the increase in the tax rate, San Francisco can
face the immediate future with good cheer and with
an assurance of public prosperity, subject only to
the provision that good citizens do their duty in the
coming municipal election and' put the administration
of all city and county affairs in : safe hands. That % is
the issue before the peoples-day. It runs directly
to every man who has a righY'to vote and has an
interest in the general good. Whether we are to have
good government or bad -government depends pri
marily upon the voters, and for that reason it.be

FIGURES contained in the annual report of Tax
Collector Smith make a good showing for the
city and a most creditable one for the Collector.
'1 he* showing is the more notable because the work
of tha year- was exceptionally heavy, owing partly to
the i'jct that some 4000 taxpayers filed protests
iigainst thp legality of the levy for hospital and school
purposes, and partly to the increase of the tax rate
over that of the previous year, which necessitated
making out and mailing some 34,000 extra tax bills.
., Of the extra tax bills sent out the Collector ob
jairfed payments of upward of 24.000, ranging from
one cent upward. Of these the Collector says that if
liot collected they "would have entailed great expense
npoB the city by reason of tlfe fact that they would
have to have been advertised in the delinquent tax
Irst," Of the total collections the report says:
'"The entire amount charged against the Tax Col
lector was $6,124,654 15. of which the actual amount
delinquent Ivas the sum of $31,913 45. or a trifle over
fifty-two one-hundredths of one per cent. The
amount collected from licenses was $485,682 35, as
against. $495,061 50 for the fiscal year 1001-02. making
a deficit of $9720 85. owing to the action taken by the
Police Commission against nickel-in-the-slot ma
chines."*
The smallness of the percentage of delinquent
taxes*is one of the notable features of the report. It
is the smallest delinquency in the history of the city
and bears witness to the fidelity and the earnestness
with .which the work of the office was performed. It
is to be noted, further, that notwithstanding the in
creasing work of the office and the thorough man
ner in which it is being performed. Tax Collector
Smith will reduce the cost of operating it this year
by upward of $6000.
Irr the general confusion existing in so many de
partments of the present municipal administration, a
confusion which in some departments, like that of
the Board of Public Works, amounts to veritable
scandals, it is gratifying to note the excellent work
that has been <Ione by Tax Collector Smith and also
by Auditor Bachr and Treasurer McDougall. Their
offices have been efficiently and economically man
aged. The work has been well and promptly done,
and 'the records can be studied with satisfaction by

PERSONAL MENTION.
Charges of that kind made on such authority ought
not to be ignored at Washington. If it be true that
we are fitting our costly warships with cheap ma
chinery, and manning them with incompetent stokers
and machine men, we are likely to some day have a
disaster that will cost us dear. The charges are made
the more serious because Syren and Shipping hints
that the worthless machinery and fittings are accepted
"probably in accordance with an agreeable and con
fidential understanding with persons who know the
three degrees of perfectionâ addition, division and
silence.", â¢
Reviewing the reports of 'accidents, to ships that
.were disabled during the work performed under Ad
miral Dewey in the Caribbean Sea,- our New -York
contemporary goes on to say the disasters. were- due
partly to the incompetency of the crews employed in
working their machinery. and partly to the inefficiency
of some of the machine fittings, with which they were
equipped. To one of those two causes it is. $atd every
accident reported is primarily due.
In dealing with the first of these causes, Syren and
Shipping says:. "Four naval vessels under repair at
the present time "show by their' burned < boilers,
broken cylinders, leaky valves and Other defects in
machinery the results from handling by ignorant and
incompetent stokers and mechanics." Of the second
cause it says: "A number of officers of our navy
have told us that the breakdowns of certain sorts of
steam fittings in naval vessels on which they sail is
due to the purchase from favored contractors of in
ferior pipe, fittings, valves and packing. Flimsy, stuff
of this sort made especially for use in cheap excur
sion boats which are built to sell for low prices are
put on board naval vessels Nvhere the naval officers
have specified heavy goods of the best- grades."
' a 3CIDENTS to our naval vessels, even when
/\ cruising or going through maneuvers in Home
â¢* Â¦*â¢ waters, have been .so frequent as to have occa-.
sioned no little surprise' amoi)g people -who give any
heed to them at all. It is announced that since the
beginning of the present year they have been so nu
merous and of such serious nature as to have entailed
the expenditure of upward of $1,000,000 for repairs.
As a result of their frequency there has been a gcod
deal of curiosity concerning the causes, and efforts
have been repeatedly made to find out where the
responsibility for them rests.
As a rule the naval officers have placed the blame
upon the contractors who built. the ships, while the
contractors on their side have laid the blame on the
naval authorities. It will be remembered that not
long ago one of the largest of our shipbuilders when
asked to explain the breaking down of a warship
constructed by him, stated that he had built the ves- t
sel according to specifications to carry guns of a
given weight, but that when she was armed the naval
authorities placed heavier guns upon her, and thus
subjected her to a greater strain than had been cal
culated.
A new view of the is presented in a recent
issue of the American Syren and Shipping. That
paper, which holds a high rank as an authority on
shipping" matters of all kinds, places the whole re
sponsibility upon the naval department,, but not in
the way stated by the shipbuilder. After referring to
naval vessels "which broke down after a few days
of practice on home stations," it says: "As these ships
were put into trie best possible condition prior to
the orders to assemble for sea practice, it is as plain
as a pikestaff that there is something radically,
wrong with the manner in which these vessels are
handled at sea." .' â¢ ,.. â¢Â¦,-'Â¦

STOCKTON. Aug. 3.-At a meeting of
the directors of the Chamber of Com
merce this afternoon the matter of mak
ing an exhibit at the State Fair was dis
cussed, and it was detdded to make a spe
cial showing 'at the ioming event. The
resolution setting forth such Intention and
urging upon manufacturers the desira
bility of making individual exhibits was
jsarsed. Secretary Brown will go to Sac
ramonto in the morning to make prelim
inary" arrangements.
It is. probable that considerable of the
exhibit, which is to appear later at St.
Louis will be. taken to Sacramento. v It is
believed that the county and the local
business men -will make a very favorable
showing. The resolutions are as follows:
This gain of the negro is not confined to the South.
In the Northern States the blacks gained I7t,oi2 in
the decade 1890-1900. The problem is upon us all
and cannot be treated as sectional. So far, the best
mind of the North sees a solution in moral elevation
and progress in the civilized arts of self-support. Is
there any other alternative but the fee-faw-fumming
of the fire-eating Tillman?
From these statistics it is evident, given equal
physical conditions, the. negro population- will soon
vastly outnumber the white through superior fecun
dity alone. That is the true Southern problem and
the national problem as well. It is the reason for
Tollman's barbaric revolt against every proposition
to cleanse and humanize the negro, to lead him out
of the conditions in which his revolting crimes are
committed, but to slaughter him like a beast for not
"keepin' his place.'' The problem is one that may
attract and appall the most heroic philosophy, but its
solution is not helped by insisting that the whites in
contact with it shall abandon themselves to the mur
der of human beings merely because they do not
keep their place in conditions in spite of which they
make a steady gain upon the white population.
Referring to the causes of negro mortality and
the age of greatest loss, it is found that one-third die
in infancy, of preventable causes, under the age of
5. Between 5 and 10 the death rate is -small, but it
rises again at. 20,' the age of tubercular and allied
diseases.. Of. the 11 54 deaths of negroes 178 were
caused by' consumption and 95 by pneumonia, so that
chronic and acute-respiratory diseases claimed 253.
Bright's disease took 128, enteric and allied mala
rial diseases of , filth* called 156.. Here we have,
grouped. -deaths^ from preventable causes amounting
to 537, /directly refecSble to the immoral, habits and
bad \ sanitation -- prevalent among the blacks. If
taught^bei(te'r, last gear's negro death rate would
haver been reduced td 617, or to 160 less than the
birth-rate!.' Itjs'tq. be supposed that the whites of
Charleston; live, under more sanitary and better
moral -'conditions, 1 for/ their ; death rate per 1000 is
only, 18.08, which is< about normal for such a popu
lation oh the South 'Atlantic coast.
SENATORS' Tillman of South Carolina and
Burton of Kansas have arranged a discussion
of the negro- problem before the different Chau-
Kaifqun assemblies during the summer. It seems to
i have been a mistake to add Tillmau to the torrid
conditions of the, Eastern summer. In his first
speech lie advocated "'shootin' niggers who don't keep
their place." and* belched vocal brimstone like an-
It is a mistake in the South to put this person for
ward as an exponent of her views upon this : serious
issue. Granting all that is charged against the ne
gro's capacity for self-government, and all that is
charged against his bad habits, thrifty temperance and
morals, if we add to that denial that he is a human
being and refusal to grant himiany rights superior
to those of the beasts that perish, a situation is cre
ated that projects to the present "generation of white
people in the South, in intensified form, the evils
that worked upon them when the negroes were slaves
and as a result of that condition.
In fact, according to the programme offTillman,,
the negroes now arc to be denied rights which they
enjoyed in common with the domestic animals whose
subjection they shared. The slave's status as prop
erty was a protection, since slave-holders would,
neither destroy their own property nor- seriously
impair its productive power by ill-usage. Men in
the South continue to so protect their animal chat
tels, but that protection is withdrawn from the negro
by TiUman's proposition, and he may be shot for not
keeping his place among the beasts, though denied
the safeguards that are around his four-footed fel
lows. * _, . Â¦ â¢
Of course philosophy and philanthropy point to
the duty, not of elevating- the negro, but of teach
ing him to elevate himself *out of a condition of im
morality, bad sanitary and other habits, thriftlessness
snd wastefulness, to a state in which he may enjoy
the natural rights of humanity. There is no use gird
ing at the North on the subject of the negro's past
condition of slavery. When Jefferson wrote the
original draft of the Declaration of Independence he
put among its clauses damnatory of the English King
in accusation for introducing slavery into the colo
nies and importing negroes from Africa to that con
dition in the new country. If that had been left in
the completed document we would have had an earlier
and a peaceful abolition of slavery in this country,
but it would have left with us the precise problem
which Tillman is discussing so unwisely.
Tillman seems to derive his ferocity from the reve
lation of statistics, and to get thcYefrom a desire for
extermination of the black race. The vital statistics
0/ Charleston, in his own State, disclose conditions
which may well excite apprehension. In 1902 the
local census showed in that city 24,285 whites and
31.522 negroes. In that year the deaths were of 461
whites and 1153 negroes. Only 1 in 52 whites died,
while the negro mortality was 1 in 27. At such a
rate of mortality the negro would soon disappear.
But the aspect is changed by the birth rate. In the
3ear 751 negroes were born to 354 white?. Of the
whites 107 more died than were born; of the blacks
396.

cil the grand; officers and delegates,
as is the custom, will assemble at
St. Mary's . Cathedral, where a solemn
high mass will be celebrated in opening
the Grand Council.
Monday, August 17. The session
will continue four days, during .which
time consideration will be given to the
reports of officers for the last term, to
gether with reports of all standing com
mittees. It Is not thought that many
proposed amendments will be presented,
as the constitution and laws as they
now stand seem to. meet the needs of
the society. It is anticipated that much
discussion will be had regarding the
advisability of creating the office of or
ganizer. In any event it is certain that
the present satisfactory condition of the
order will invite discussion as to ways
and means' for further advancing the in
terests of the organization. Apart from
the legislative work of the session the
election of officers' for the ensuing term
will be a matter of general interest.
Grand Vice President James D. Whalen
of Alameda Council No. 47. Livermore,
Cal., will likely be advanced to the
grand presidency. Contests are certain
to result for the other offices, particular
ly ihat of grand director.
The year closing has been a satisfac
tory one. as the reports will .show a gain
in membership and finances, despite the
losses resulting from dropping all mem
bers not in good financial standing' in
the subordinate councils under a policy
in this direction inaugurated by the
last Grand Council.
The reception and entertainment of
the delegates will be arranged and con'
ducted by the board of management,
representative of the San Francisco
councils of the institute, and the pro
gramme as now determined upon will in
clude a reception and dance under the
auspices of the Young Ladies'Instltute
at Native Sons' Hall Monday evening,
August 17. Tuesday evening, the 18th,
will be the occasion of a theater party.
The banquet will be held at the Califor
nia Hotel on the evening of the 19th.
and the session will conclude with a ball
at Native Sons' Hall on Thursday even
ing, the 20th.

Ready said also that the officials of the
Union Lumber Company at Fort Bragg
had sent to him for men to take the place
of the locked-out mlllmen and that ho had
no difficulty in getting men to go up there
and take the places of the strikers. He
also said that, could he be assured police
protection, he could get at any time 1000
men to take the places of the carmen In
this city. He said that should he adver
tise for 1000 carmen thousands of farm
hands and others employed in the coun
try would come to the city at once.
A tailor filed an affidavit in which he
swore that the same carman's uniform
that he sold last September for $22 he was
now selling for $20. *
The case goes on this morning at 10
o'clock. . , .
Livernash turned back again to the
many thousands of men that visited
Ready's office looking for work.' He
wanted to be Informed how the place was
kept in order with such vast crowds of
men visiting there.
"Oh, I told you before." said Ready,
"the only trouble we' have is with dema
gogues and occasionally some poor, old
drunk that floats Jn." ,
"Well, you must think the demagogues
pretty bad citizens, do you not, Mr.
Ready?" he was asked by the carmen's
counsel.
"The trouble of it is that a great num
ber of them are not citizens at all," was
"the witness' quick reply. ,
Ready, was on the witness stand all the
afternoon and bitterly complained of trade
.unionism as a hindrance to the State. He
salÂ«l that thousands of men were forced
out into the country and compelled' to
work picking fruit and doing rough rail
road work, when they would like to re
main in the city. He said that these men
were forced out of the city, as they were
unable to put up the $10 or $15 necessary
to gain an admittance to a trade union.
USUALLY NOT CITIZENS.
THOUSANDS ASK WOBK
"I must admit I have heard the word
used on the street," said Ready.
Continuing under cross-examination.
Ready said that between 90,000 and 100,000
men called last month at his employment
office. Livernash tried to get Ready to
retract this statement, but the employ
ment agent could not be shaken.
"Well, if you have so many men calling
there, I suppose you need quite a force of
police to keep them in order," said Liver
nash.
"No, I have no trouble with the men at
all," replied Ready. "Once in a while,
however, I have to call a police officer
and get him to remove a demagogue from
the sidewalk."
"What do you call a demagogue?" asked
Livernash.
After deep study Ready replied: "I
think a demagogue is a man that raises
trouble. He does not know his own busi
ness, and tries to meddle in other peo
ple 6.
# JII J lk 1. to * ee a man work Â°y the sweat
of his hands and brow," continued the
witness. "I like to see a man make an
honest living by work, even if it is by the
pick and shovel."
"When did you last work with a pick
and shovel?" asked Livernash with a
sneer.
"I struck San Francisco sixteen years
ago with Just Jl in my pocket." replied
Beady proudly. "I had a roll of blankets
and I worked for a while with a pick and
shovel in the streets of San Francisco for
$2 a day."
Attorney Uvernash objected to the tiling
of Ready's statement on the grounds that
it was incompetent and irrelevant. Llver
nash also said that Ready was an un
scrupulous man, opposed to trade union
ism. He wound up his objection by re
questing that Ready be produced at the
afternoon session for cross-eaminatlon.
The employment agent was on hand as
requested and LJvernaah's first question
was: v.rv<v
"Your place is the headquarters for
scabs, is it not?"
"I don't know. the meaning of the word
'scab,* " answered the witness, seemingly
bristling for a fight.
""Well, you will know before I get
through with you," Livernash assured
him. /
At the arbitration proceedings between
the carmen and the United Railroads yes
terday a statement from Herbert V.
Ready of the firm of Murray & Ready,
employment agents, was read. In it he
stated that between 3000 .and 4000 Idle men
visited the employment office every work
ing day in the week, and that he could
.secure in two days 1000 men willing: to
work as motormen and grlpmen in this
city. , :\

Mr. Talleu's Statement:
"My doctors grave me up. They said
they could do nothing: for me. as I had
consumption. Their treatment did me
no good. I reduced In weight from, 137
to 108 pounds. I coughed, my blood did
not circulate, my feet and hands were
cold and I was so weak I could, do noth-
ing. In this condition I took up the
Electro-Chemic treatment.
"In eight days I have gained eight

agrees with me and my strength is rap-
idly returning."

the alarm, mounted a horse and called
for volunteers to wreak vengeance on the
fleeing negroes. Two hundred men and
boys joined In the , chase. Neighboring

hunt proceeded until nightfall. The Sher
iff with a detachment of deputies and
police followed the mob to prevent a
lynching if possible.

SARATOGA, Aug. 3.â It would re
quire great courage on the part of
any critic to decry the perform
ance of Waterboy, who ran the
best race of his career and won
the rich Saratoga handicap, worth $9000
j to the winner, after a drive through the
! homestretch with Hunter Raine. These
j two drew away on the last furlong, caus
| ing tremendous excitement when it ap
! peared for a moment as if the grand
i black horse, which had so nobly wlth
! stood the challenge of every contender,
| was In grave danger of losing the rich
I race to erratic Hunter Raine, who on
i seme of his performances was the very
last horse that the average racegoer
thought stood a chance. But, thanks to
Â¦ the energy and ability of Odom, this
catastrophe was averted, and Waterboy
! endured punishment, withstood the rush
1 of Hunter Raine and won by about three
: quarters of a length In 2:05 3-5, which
equaled the track record, made by G. 13.
Morris' Cunard last year. i
There was, however, great difference in
the weight carried by Cunard and Water
boy. The latter had up 127 pounds, and
the track was deeper to-day than it was
last year. Hence the merit of Waterboy'a
victory appeals to most onlooKers as
something far beyond any race recently
run.
Still old turfmen said, when the event
was well over and the enthusiasm had
thoroughly effervesced, that so many or
dinary horses were so close to the win
ner" as to discount the performance.
Hunter Raine, it is true, is hard for the
ordinary racegcer to properly gauge, but
when It Is seen that both Goldsmith and
Gunfire were decisively beaten, and that
Â¦there were no accidents that caused their
defeat, the fact remains that if Water
boy's record Is not a very high-class per
formance then there are no racers of class
in the East.
Hunter Raine's excellent race was to
have been expected, for his party played
him heavily to be third, and to a moder
ate extent to win. George Odom told
Willie Shields that at the head of the
stretch he feared Hunter Raine was go
ing to win, but Cochran took a steadying
pull on the Shields horse and Odom sud
denly stole away with Waterboy, which
move really won him the race. Summary:

A smart westerly wind Â¦ was blowing
when the fleet of cruisers started on a
thirty-mile course for a cup worth 60
guineas presented by the vice commodore
of the club. There were five entries. The
gaff of Sir James Fender's yawl Brunhllde
snapped just before she crossed the line,
while immediately after the Therese car
ried away her bowsprit, leaving Eckford's
Namara. Donaldson's Bona and Kerr's
Valdora to compete for the prize.
The race for the rear commodore's cup,
value 110 iruineas_ brought up three
schooners. The German Emperor's Me
teor led over the line, with Cicely on her
weather beam and Cayley's Adela close
astern. In the course of the first round
the Cicely carried awajr her gaff and the
Meteor led to the end of the round.
A number of other minor handicap races
started.
Â¦ The King landed at Cowes this morn-
Ing and visited the Duchess of Manches
ter, who, with her sister and the Hon.
and Mrs. George Keppel, are among the

Special Dlfpatch to The Call
Now that the rifie.has been laid awty
all expect to see Jeff indulge in his rou
tine work more consistently. No fault
can be picked In his condition. When
questioned about the weight proposition,
Billy Delaney said he did not think Jef
fries would weigh a pound less on the
night of August 14 thaji he does to-day.
In the past, with a fight ahead of him,
the boilermaker has laid awake nights
(/reaming of methods to remove adipose
tissue and suffered from nightmare in
which he imagined that in a single night
his avordupois had suddenly Increased to
that of Fatty Blodcs. Jeff seldom step3
on the scales now, and like all flghterj
13 as secretive about It as an old maid la
of her age. It \s doubtful, though,
whether the bar would balance at 230.
The weather here continues warm and
It would not be surprising to see the
champion order his traps packed up and
take his departure for Oakland before
the week has passed. In this respect he
is freaky and changeable as the schedule
on some jerkwater railroad. His good
humor, though, is contagious. Among
the recent arrivals here is Billy Lyons,
the silver-haired philosopher of O'Farrell
street, who recently invented a speed
developer, and hopes to induce Jeffries
to give It a trial. Billy himself is a rec
crd holder, and Jeff appears to look fav
orably on the invention. Morris H. La.no
of Kmeryville, an ardent admirer of the
man from Los Angeles, is a guest at the
springs. A. crowd is looked for to-mor
row. F. E. MULHOLLAND.
HARBIN SPRINGS, Aug. 3.-There wll]
be no more, tomfoolery or glossing ovei
in the Jeffries camp. While the glanl
bollermaker thinks it is a string of pearl*
to a string of Frankfurters that tht
championship lies In no danger, and ic
fancy's mind can already hear the chÂ«Â«rs
of the great crowd and picture hlmaell
counting over the winner's share of the
purse, trainer and manager Billy Delanej
occasionally reminds his charge that hot
favorites have been bowled over before.
"Jeff" went on his last deer hunt yester
day. Together with Eddie Hays, sod of
proprietor Jim Hays, the pair started ofl
on two mules at 4 o"clock a. m. and after
a long, tiresome tramp over the hills in
the scorching sun. returned home at din
ner time without having secured any
game. The hounds, according to th<j
story of the hunters, jumped three big
bucks, but never a chance for a shot.
No doubt this is true as the yarn of the
biggest fish being lost, but as JefT 13 an
unerring shot, it may require a pinch of
shot to be palatable. However, nobody
here disputed it with him.
Yesterday morning the champion again
put in six rounds at boxjng, two each
with Kitzaimmons, Joe Kennedy and Jack
Jeffries, after a couple of hours exercise
with the pulleys, light dumbbells, bag
and skipping rope. Bob^Fitzslmmons is
not a believer, in love taps and he and
Jeffries mixed things in lively fashion.
Speed, speed, speed, that is the desirable
quantity now, nnd Fitzstnamons kept the
champion chasing him continually, as it
is figured here that will be Jim Corbetta
plan of campaign. The work was so fast
that Jeff was somewhat winded at the
finish. It was mapped out for him to
box again in the evening* but he evident
ly did not think this necessary-
CHICAGO. Aug. 3-Rain fell in lor
rents for thirty minutes just before the
running of the Garden City Handicap at
Harlem to-day and completely changed
Â¦ the aspect of the race and caused the de
"feat of the popular colt, Dick Welles,
which, despite the sloppy track, was
made favorite at 3 to 2. With Welles
anchored by the sticky going, the handi
<appers went to- Jack Ratlin and on his
victory a tremendous killing was made.
He was eteadily pounded from 10 to 1
down to 9 to 2 ar.d then won easily by a
length and a half from Ahola. On ac
count of numerous scratches the sixth
race was dc-ciared off and the seventh

Diedrich Becker. ex-Supervisor and
well known among'the wholesale and re
tail grocers of this city, passed away yes
terday at his late residence, 837 Sutter
street, after an illness of but one week.
The late Mr: Becker's last illness was oc
casioned through an accident which hap
pened to him while on a visit to his
brother-in-law at San Pablo last week.
He was riding in a buggy and leading a
young colt by a halter. The animal shied
and In trying to escape, the rope of the
halter, which Mr. Becker had twisted
round the Index finger of the left hand,
could not be unloosened and the finger
was pulled apart from the first joint. The
wound was temporarily dressed by a phy
sician, but blood poisoning set In.
Mr. Becker, who was 57 years of age
at the time of his death, was one of four
brothers who came to America from Han
over forty years ago. He leaves a widow
and four daughters, Mrs. J. E. C. von Or
sen, Mrs. A. Hansen, Mrs. E. A. Groez
inger and Miss Edna Becker.
During the years of 1889 and 1S90 Mr.
Becker served as a member of the Board
of Supervisors,* representing the old
Eighth Ward. In which he had lived a
greater portion of his life.
The funeral will take place to-morrow
afternoon at 2 o'clock from St. Markus
Church on O'Farrell otreeU
BLOOD POISONING ENDS ,
THE LIFE OF D. BECKER
PLACERVILLE, Augr. 3.-A report
reached town* this afternoon that five
men went to a ranch owned by a man
named Pine, twelve miles east of here, at
daylight to-day, and demanded break
fast. Food was cooked for the supposed
convicts, one of whom was a negro. The
men talked but little and were extremely
nervous. They remained but a short
time and departed for the mountains to
the east. Pine is said to be entirely
reliable. A posse was sent to the scene
and will take up the trail.

Danny Lynch, Lind's partner, claimed
he had bet $250 on the mare and thought
she would win. All were questioned
closely by Judge Hamilton before the
ruling was announced. v^*
CHICAGO. Aug. 3.â The racing stable
of C. Llnd & Co. of San Francisco and
Jockey Treanor were suspended at the
Harlem track to-day. The cause of the
official action was the suspicious ride
upon Orsina In the fifth race by Treanor,
the Llnd mare finishing third to Postmas
ter Wright and McGee.
Orsina was given a poor ride, Treanor
taking her back from first position at the
quarter to fourth place. Then In the
stretch he made his run far too late, and,
although the mare was full of running,
he could not reach the leaders.
Owner Lind explained his orders to
Treanor by saying that in some of the
mare's races she had been sent to Ihe
front to race, but that she had faint
heartedness at that style and to-day It
was decided to have her come from be
hind. Treanor claimed those were his
orders, and that he tried to follow the
riding instructions faithfully. y

William Dougherty, a longshoreman, re
siding at 10 St. Charles place, was seri

evening. He was engaged in unloading a
vessel when a pile of boxes toppled over,
burying him and fracturing his leg and
arm. He was removed to the Harbor Re
ceiving Hospital, whet* his injuries were
Longshoreman Injured.
The accident occurred just south of
the main station while the locomotive
was rounding a curve. Engineer Grant
was slowing down speed, entering the
railroad yards, when t:ie left side driv
ing rod broke. It flew around, tearing

Sunset members will select two delegates to
complete the ticket. ,,Â¦
The chair was instructed to appoint an
executive committee, and a finance com
mittee for the coming campaign.
The following delegates were proposed:
Judge Aitken instanced many startling
scandals that had occurred In the mu
nicipal governments of Philadelphia, Mil
waukee and Chicago, without reflecting
on the civic government of San Francisco,
but showing how necessary, he said, it
was to have the best of men in office.
If they -could not send delegates to the
convention without consulting Martin
Kelly and other "bosses" he would ad
vise them not to send them at all. He
advised the voters to elect men who
would emulate the better things of the
Eastern cities and not tolerate a forest,
otherwise telegraph poles, on the public
thoroughfares of the city.
The permanent officers elected were:
Edwin T. McMurray. president: John J.
Cassidy, secretary, and John H. Gray.
treasurer.
Judge John R. Aitken. speaking of good
government and the necessity of select
ing the best of men as civic representa
tives, said that the party was going to
elect officers from the top to ,the t bottom
of thf ticket. In telling of the strong
sort of man desired as Mayor he alluded
to what he called the present condition
of tearing up streets and having streets
unrepaired. He denounced the want of
proper, school accommodation and cited
the condition of one school where the
stairs were actually rotten.

This district, like other parta of the city,

the light punching bag and bombarded It
for half an hour. Every movement of

a number of others.
Actor-boxer James J. Corbet* went back
to the gloves and punching bag at Croll's

ing the green sward of Sutro Heights for
two afternoons and nights as Charles the
Wrestler In Nance O'Neil's open-air pre
sentation of "As You Like It." His brief
surcease from training work caused the
pugilist to take on avoirdupois. Corbett
weighed 186>4 pounds stripped yesterday.
He expects to be near this notch, or a few
pounds heavier, when he goes up against
the bulky champion, James J. Jeffries.
Swift arm and foot work was what Cor
bett aimed at in his boxing and bag
punching yesterday. He flew around Yank
Kenny for seven rounds like a moving
picture, smashing his big sparring partner
at will and getting away without having
his hair mussed. It is thought that In the
plan of the battle he is to engage in with
the boiler-maker Corbett will do the mos
quito jabbing act. occasionally to annoy
the massive Jeffries into slashing the
atmosphere. In the game of clip, poke
and duck out of range of flying gloves
the ex-champion is generally regarded as
the peer of any of the heavyweights.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 3.â In the opinion
of officials of the Navy Department ex
perience Is the teacher from which naval
officers have learned the lesson that the
American neg-ro is unfit for service In the
Amfrican navy, and that the sooner he
is eihr.lr.ated the better it will be for the
â¢ Â»ervic*\ There Is no law on the statute
i?oo\f? against the enlistment of negroes
.in the naw, nor is it contemplated that
â¢ iny shall be put there.
; The negro's unfltness for the navy lies
.not in his color, but in his quality. He
has beerÂ» tried in the service and found
â¢ wanting, according to recruiting offi
cers, who declare that the class of ne
, sroes applying for enlistment is far be
â¢low the lowest class of whites that apply,
and as a result few negroes are enlisted.
In an enlisted force of nearly 29,000 men
lo-day only about 500 are negroes, and
"the number is said to be decreasing rap
idly owing to the large number of dis
charges which are made necessary by
their failure to make good as sailor
m'en.
Anticipating that these facts might be
used by enemies of the administration
with a view to political advantage, naval
officers have been instructed that they
:ire to examine carefully every applicant
'for enlistment, whether white or black,
and that the same requirements are to be
".applied to each-
In the hope that the negroes might be

maneuvers, the recruiting officers were
instructed to keep a sharp lookout for ap
plicants for such duty. Few negroes of
.necessary qualifications were found.

for a long time existed between the ne
pro eailcr men and their white associates.

rates went into effect commencing August*
1, and every train bound westward has
been crowded since that day.

promising for a successful financial cam
paign. Secretary of State C. F. Curry of
fered to make a canvass of Sacramento to
aid the committee, but it was the senti
ment of the meeting that the means could
be raised in San Francisco, as many of
the most generous minded mercantile men

ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS.
Report waa made last night to the gen
eral committee and also to the executive
committee of the Grand Armv that the
controversies over the construction of the
arch at the intersection of Kearny, Third
and Market streets had been adjusted in
a manner that would enable the con
tractors to complete the work according
to original plans and specifications' on
which the Board of Public "Works granted
a permit. The presence of employed
workmen on the arch was accented as
additional proof of settlement. The con
tractor was granted an extension of time
until August 16 to finish the arch. The
original contract provided that the work
should be finished August 9. At the con
ference of contractors, engineers and
Public Works' Commissioners yesterday It
was decided that the platform suspended
over Market street should be supported
by standards from the ground in order to
lessen the strain on the wire cables. The
executive committee appointed O. R.
Morris as consulting engineer. The stand
ards will not interfere with cable or
electric cars, but traffic in team3 will be
diverted for three or four days. Mayor
Schmltz said to the committee that the
police would be ordered to divert the
traffic. It was suggested cars passing
under the platform should move slowly
so that passenger* alighting would not
run against the standards.
MEETING LARGELY ATTENDED.

at the rooms of the California Promotion
Committee, 25 New Montgomery street,

ing the State appropriation of 525,000, had
been raised, and obligations amounting
to $49,000 had been authorized. The an
nouncement was made that an additional
sum of J15.000 would enable the commit
tee to carry out the accepted plans for
the encampment. The statement was
made by the chairman that very many
prominent merchants, business men and
manufacturers who usually contribute
liberally had not been called upon for
money. Volunteers then agreed to visit
leading firms. The opinion was expressed
by Major General Shafter. Major General
Dickinson, A. W. Barrett. F. E. Beck, W.
H. Jordan. Charles F. Curry. J. B. Fuller,
John C. Currier, Henry C. Dibble, A.

cally Instructed none of his men to bear
firearms.
The striking- linemen were not concerned la
yesterday's affair. They have given and have
kept their promise to the Mayor to maintain
peace and quiet. The telephone company
should not allow Its men to work on Sunday
and give sympathizers & chance to commit
overt acts.
Under present conditions we ar? obliged to
do line work when best we can. We are not
looking for trouble, nor are we trying to
foment disturbance. Far from that. We feel
that our men have Just as much right to
work as the striking linemen have to strike.
That is the situation in a nutshell.
E. W. Davis, secretary of the striking
linemen's grievance committee, said:
said: *
I do not believe the strikers themselves com
mitted this assault. I must say that during
the last week or ten days they have con
ducted themselves in & very gentlemanly man
ner and been very fair, but the men were
assaulted and the result Is that none of our
linemen will go out unless riven police pro
tection. As some of our old employes live
within a few blocks of where this trouble
occurred yesterday I questioned Mr. Shasteen
very carefully regarding the appearance of
the men -who assaulted him and am satisfied
that none of our old employes were mixed up
In the trouble. /
There is no question about these men hav
ing been assaulted. I feel that I must give
the company's linemen police protection against
hoodlums to avoid a possible repetition of
cuch a scene as waa enacted yesterday. I
feel that the telephone company Is alone at
fault in this matter in sending Us workmen
out on Sunday to do work In that particular
neighborhood -where .there Is pernaps more
danger of such an occurrence than there would
have been In any other of ihe city. I
do not blame the strikers for yesterday's
trouble and I believe they have kept faith
with me since they agreed to use enly quiet
methods, and to avoid violence H their en
deavors to persua.de the strike-breakers to quit
work.
Concerning the situation, Manager Ellis
Neither Mayor Olney nor Manager Eu
gene J. Ellis of the telephone company
blame the striking linemen for the dem
onstration. In restoring police guard to
the company's employes the Mayor said:
Mayor "Warren Olney to-day directed
the Chief of Police to furnish police pro
tection to telephone company employes.
The order Is the result of an assault that
was made yesterday afternoon at Twen
tieth and Market streets on R. S. Shas
teen and L. B. Tale, telephone men who
were stoned by a crowd of hoodlums.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
* 1113 Broadway, Aug. 3.
An opportunity for "doing politics" is
presented in the choice cf successors to
the Rev. Dr. Foute, chairman, and Major
W. B. Hooper, an influential member of
the standing committee of the diocese of
California. A position on this commit
ter, which is the next highest spiritual
and temporal authority in the diocese. Is
coveted by both clergy and churchmen.
The names of Dr. Middleton, Henry T.
Scott and, William H. Crocker have been
suggested with the chances of the elec
tion of the first named. Dr. Rellly of
St. Paul's or Rev. B. M. Weeden of St.
Luke's are spoken of as URely candidates
to succeed Rev. Dr. Foute. The stand-
Ing committee elects.
Another parish is on the lookout for
seme one to succeed the Rev.jreteTihon In
nis. the ultra ritualistic rector of the
church of St. Mary the Virgin.
A prominent churchman, commenting
upon the extraordinary difficulty of se
curing competent rectors for California,
is of the belief that it indicates the gen
eral scarcity of clergymen throughout the
country on account of the rapidly increas
ing population and the unexampled ex
pansion of the church itself. The 6pinion
was expressed that the embarrassment
was not temporary, but likely to continue.
PLACES ON COMMITTEE.
To these parishes there has been added
old St. John's, Oakland, whose last rector
left on account of parish dissensions and
accepted a church In the East St. John's
pays $1500 a year and Is considered a de
sirable charge. The parish is ritualistic
and will try to find a high church priest
if it can.
Trinity Church. San Jose, is without a
rector, though offering $300 a month for
the right man. A call to an Eastern cler
gyman was declined with thanks and the
congregation has to be content with a
substitute.
St. Paul's, Oakland, is another desirable
parish, offering $300 a month for a clergy
man, but so far without meeting with
success. A call was given Rev. Frederick
Stein of St. George's Church. New York,
but that clergyman was compelled to de
cline on the advice of a local physician,
who decided on the unsuitabillty of the
climate, Mr. Stein being a sufferer from a
disease of the throat.
OTHER DESIRABLE PULPITS.
An unprecedented condition of affairs
exists In the Episcopal diocese of Califor
nia at the present time, and churches and
authorities are very much puzzled to ac
count for the singular emergency which
has arisen. By resignation or decease
more churches have been deprived of their
rectors than ever before In the jurisdic
tion within the same period. Since Janu
ary no less than nine prominent parishes
have become pastorless. The Rev.
Charles Gardner resigned at Palo Alto to
become rector of Stanford University.
Christ Church, Alarneda, was compelled
to look for a successor to Dr. Lacy; Trin
ity, Oakland, lost its estimable clergyman
by resignation through the infirmities ot
age, and St. Stephen's of this city, by the
eudden death of Dean Lion, was forced, to
look elsewhere for a clergyman to worth
ily carry on the work. Fortunately all of
these charges have been filled to. the en
tire satisfaction of their congregations,
but there remain five other churches
which are on the lookout for clergymen
to fill the pulpits, and have so far been
unsuccessful. Now that Grace Is com
pelled by the death of Dr. R. C. Foute
to find some one to succeed him the diffi
culty of ail the other parishes is increased.
The pulpit is known throughout the
church as one of â¢the most desirable in
the United States on account of the enor
mous wealth of its congregations, past
and present, and its liberality and activ
ity in good works. The Huntingtons,
Stanfords, Crockers and Hopklnses were
at one time known as attendants and as-
Blsted in completing the beautiful edifice.
It has always been the church frequented
by the Gwins, Tevises and others of the
most exclusive Southern set, and Is pre
pared to pay a high price for a clergy
man. Hitherto It has paid its rector $500
a month, but, if necessary, It will go
higher.
California Is represented In this ar
rangement by the State Board of Exam
iners, for which Secretary W. S. Melick
acts, and the agricultural department U
represented by Professor Samuel Fortier.
the Pacific experiment station agent, who
makes his headquarters at the Univer
sity of California.
Professor Fortier Is the active head of
the Investigations now going on. In the
course of his work he will proceed upon
a well denned plan, which embrace*
studies of the duties of water in Irriga
tion; studies of methods of irrigation in
California with a view to better methods;
studies of losses of water from canals
through seepage and evaporation and the
best means to alleviate them, either by
improving the canals or removing the
surplus water by drainage; studies in tha
methods and cost of pumping water.
His investigations will have nothing to do
with the geological phenomena of the
country, that part of the work being
left entirely to the geological survey.
The investigations will carry Professor
Fortier from one end of the State to the
other and every agricultural center will
be visited. He has already turned his
attention to the San Joaquln valley,
where tire irrigation problem Is of such
immense importance. There the seepage
and evaporation of the canals Is demand
ing attention and a question has arisen
as to the comparative merits of the
check or pan system for flooding culti
vated land as against the furrow system,
either of which needs to be corrected.
In connection with the studies In the
cost of pumping Professor Fortier to-day
sent to the farmers of the State a circu
lar containing a series of questions rela
tive to their pumping plants, which the
farmers are expected to answer. ' This
branch of the investigation will receive
the assistance of Professor J. N. Le
Conte and A. J. Turner. The main pur
pose in collecting this Information Is to
compare the relative cost of Irrigation
by pumping and gravity plants and t*
furnish all those who are interested in
this branch of the subject with data
as to the best kind of plant to install
under particular conditions.
The farmers of California are about to
profit in the experiments that have Just
beÂ«n inaugurated by the United State*
Department of Agriculture and the State,
acting In co-operation, to Investigate thÂ«
beat methods of using and distributing
water for Irrigation purposes. Irrigation
is one of the hardest problems with
which the farmer or orchardlst baa ta
deal, for he does not always know what
is the most economical and beneficial to
him, and It is for this reason the Govern
ment and the State have agreed to work
hand in hand for his advantage.
The last Legislature passed a bill ap
propriating $10,000 to assist irrigation in
vestigation, with the understanding that
the Government would appropriate a UkÂ«
amount for the same purpose, which the
Government has since done. This makes
(20,000 available* for these Investigations.
$10,000 of which will bÂ« used each year
for two years.

Dr. Miles* Nervine and
Heart Cure Cured.
The reason Dr. Miles' Remedies care rach
a large percentage of cases is because they
are formulated to &nd actually do, go at once
to the root of .the disease. Doctors often
mzke the mistake of treating the symptoms,
a method which must always f a il. Dr. Miles'
Nervine restores health, strength and vitality
to the nerves. Dr. Miles' Heart Cure en-
riches the blood and improves the circulation
'so that the patient speedily regains health.
"I feel it is a pleasure as well as duty to in-
â¢ form my friend* the means I used to regain
my health. 1 have been troubled a great
deal with nervousness and headache; I be-
gan to observe enlargement of the neck until
it became so bad I felt it severely, especially
blood on the brain. The least excitement
gave me dreadful pain and I woold lose all
control of mj-self. I lived in this misery for
about ten years; consulted many doctors,
bet secured no relief whatever. I com-
. menced the use of Dr. Miles' Nervine and a
few days later began the use of Dr. Miles'
Heart Cure and within a week I felt very
tnuch better. The second week my friends
told me I was looking very much better.
This encouraged me and I continued the use
of the two remedies until now I am well
enough to do my own housework without
any trouble whatever. I consider my health
good, the cure permanent and I can do any
kind of work."â Mrs. CHARLOTTE Eia.

Tte steam schooner Alcazar, which left Point

undertook and only let go when to hold on
would have Involved both vessels In disaster.
At 4 a. m. of August 3. when twenty-nve miles
wert-northwest of Point Reyes, a heavy north
west swell was encountered, which made tow-
Ing almost Impossible. Three times the hawser
parted and as many times was a new rope
passed to the disabled sailing vessel. Mean
while, however, the Alcazar's deck load shifted
to port and heavily listed as she was the tsteam

DENVER, Aug. 3.â Govtirnor Peabody
to-day answered the petition of the Idaho
Springs Miners' Union asking protection
from the State against the- banishment of
the union miners by the Alliance organi
zation of Idaho Springs, also protection
by military for them in the event they re
turn to their homes. The Governor says
that the expelled miners will have to seelc
redress through the courts at Idaho
Springs, and that under the constitution
and laws of the State he is not veste-1
with the power or authority to act In tha
matter.
EXPELLED MINERS MUST
SEEK AID OF THE COURTS
Governor Peabody Says He Has No
Authority to Act in the
Matter.
parts of the-State during the past forty
eight hours are to-night practically at a
standstill, and no. further serious ri*' is
expected. The biggest of the streams, tho
Kansas River, Is rising slowly at Kansas
City and for- a* short distance Tvest of
here, but ,at no. place along its length is
the water near the danger line.
At Kansas City the Kansas River has
risen over three feet in the past twenty
four hours, and ths Jllssourt Is up two
feet, but it must go several feet beyond
this to do any material damage, and as
no further rains are reported from tha
West to-day, a j-radual fall !s expected.
TJ\?re was 3ome uneasinci t Argentina
and Armourdale, suburbs 01 i\ansas City,
that suffered during the great flood, but
it was unwarranted. The only damaga
likely at Kansas City is from driftwood ti>
some of the temporary bridges erected
here. The current is swift, and the men
were out all day steering the driftwood
clear of the structures.

was n>t held there. The selling was at
tritjuteJ to Professional manipulation for ef

general market was in lact heavy, but the
drift of prices was quite aimles? ana sluggish
tn a degree close to inertia. The enly isig
nitk-anee to be derived from the market is.
therefore a negati%e one. the extreme apathy
of the trading representing the profound doubt
in which the speculative outlook U shrouded.
! according to all the opinions that one can
I cather in the Wall street district. The total
dealings -.v.;s iuL iittle above the 'JM.uOu shares
mark. It is necessary to ko back to the sum
mer "i !!**> to*t preceding lhP lai<t Presidential
cl<vtion t.Â» find a kvel of acttvlty as low as
that now prevailing. There were several weeks
in August and September 'of- that ytar'wben
the daily average of transactions was. less than

tthe summer the dealings for a- full clay's ses<
i p-on fell to below lUO.uOO shares. The low
1 rec^Td for that â¢ wmwr was "on August 22.
[ Â»hfn .'nly Sti,<R:(> ghHres chaured hnr.'iF. The
I total tk-alinrg for the week ending August 24
J of that year were only Â«MÂ»,00<l sharej. .The
jirinrii.ai puzzle in the situation which was
dwelt on to-day was the astcnit-hin;; main
tenance of thÂ» volume of loans of the as
soi-Iated banks in face of the thorough liquida
tion to which the stuck market has u.^en sub

the basis of credits and the argent .-elling of
securities to make this fhrinkage in marsins
or to pay off loans outright lias -b<vn patent
to all ->bs-ervers for months in the stock market.
Conjecture loses itself in the attempt to gueÂ»s
what great sinkhole can have abtmued the
tropiâ¬niiL)Us proceed* of all this liquidation

I for a future contraction there similar to that
j which Wall street has been (join* through en.
j pagfs an increasing amount of attention. The
actic-n i.r ina'-lion of to-day's market reflects
the dist-osition of the ppoculative world to sit
down and auaH further liKht on tiieÂ»e ques

cotton over the previous month shown by the
Government report on cotton agreed closely
with expectations arvl falle.1 to weaken thÂ»

opinion 'that It-had its start near the boil

was : valued at : $50,000 and the stock at
$25,000, and will be a total. loss. Owing. to
the. inflammable nature of the' goods man

building Company. The lease,, of which so
much has been said, calls for no rental, and
It expires by Its own terms within a week. .
All the claims about. work ceasing If the re
ceiver is appointed Is absurd. The Secretary
of the Navy - will let the work go on, and all
questions as to the stability of contracts will
be settled. The receiver has been-, recognized
in all other Jurisdictions and we have.no doubt
of results here. '.'Â¦;â¢> "Â¦..'Â¦
In an incredibly short time a dozen
lines of hose were playing upon, the burn
ing building from all sides and the ef
fects of the streams soon became, mani
fest. Within an hour the blaze -was un

SPECTACUULR FIRE.
announced a flre at 660 Bryant
street. Two further calls and a' general
alarm told the gravity of the conflagra
tion and while fast runs to this spot of
danger were filling the streets with the
clangor of many bells two other fires
added to the excitement.
A fire on Brannan street, above Third,
and a blaze in a lodging-house at 29 Eddy
street increased the worries of the flre
department and the fears of the public.
Though the two last fires were not serious
the multiplicity of simultaneous calls
made the situation excltlne.
The first flre was* the only serious one,
and it consumed the buildings of the
Weston Basket and Manufacturing Com
pany, the losses reaching about $50,000.
The call was turned In at 5:50 p. m.
from box 1S6, by W. H. Fuller of the
Overland Freight and Transfer Company.
Upon the arrival of the department the
battalion chief saw that the limited num
ber of engines and men at his command
could not cope with the flames ' and ' a
second call was sent in. The building, a
two-story frame, on the north line of
Bryant street, between Fourth and Fifth,
became a veritable furnace and j the in
flammable material with which It was
stored, fanned by a fresh westerly bjreeze,
burned like" 86" much tinder. - _ Â¦: .
Chief Sullivan was on the scene within
a few minutes of the second alarm, and,
acting upon his Instructions, a third call
was given. The three alarms brought to
the flre fourteen engine-companies,, four
trucks, two chemicals, one water tower
and two batteries. Even with this array,
of fire-fighting apparatus it looked for a
time as if it would be necessary \ to call
upon ail the reserve force to keep the
flames from creeping through the . block
bounded by Fourth, Fifth, Bryant and
Harrison streets and duplicating the ter
rible flre of 1SS5, which swept over the dis
trict and entailed several million dollars
of loss.
THREE fire callsâ one a general
alarmâ startled the city early last
night.
Just before 6 o'clock the bells
Mr. Pillsbury contended that Judge
nratty had no lurisdiction. as it was
phown the proceedings were brought to
secure the apoointment of an ancillary
receiver: He said th,e court lacked the
power to appoint a receiver, because such
jurisdiction and power are vested in the
United States Pistrict Court, and the rem
**dy of the complainants, if there is any.
Is procurable in that court. He pointed
out the fact that the appointment of
James Smith Jr. as receiver was based
upon a New Jersey statute providing for
the winding up of insolvent corporations,
which was suspended by the national
bankruptcy act applicable to manufac
turing concerns like the defendant, and
the United States District Court alone
had Jurisdiction to take charge of the
property of the defendant, or wind up
Mr. Pillsbury said that the company he
represented was the trustee under a mort
page executed by the United States Ship
building Company to secure the payment
cf its first mortgape bonds to the amount
of $16,000,000; also that he represented the
reorganization committee of the stock
and bond holders of the trust, composed
of George R. Sheldon, Charles S. Fair
child. John E. Borne t Max Pam and
Charles W. Wetmcre, and the North
American Company, who hold and con
trol a majority of the bonds to the
amount of . $!> .iCa.OOO, and in their behalf
objected to the appointment of a receiver.
HAS NO JURISDICTION.
One phase of the big shipbuilding trust
f.ght that beran befcre Judge Kirkpat-
Xick cf Xejtr Jersey some weeks ago was
ended before Judge Beatry in the United
States Circuit Court yesterday. Attorney
E. S. Pillsbury of San Francisco and
Henry Wollman of New York were the
principal" fieures In the ferensic contest.
Pillsbury opposed and Wollman advocated
the appointment of a receiver.
Mr. Pillsbury represented the Mercan
tile Trust Company of New York, and
he argued for two hours against the ap
pointment of a receiver for the Union
Iron Works. Mr. Wollman. who won the
contest for a receivership in the primary
case in New Jersey, argued vigorously
for the recognition of the receivership In
this jurisdiction. He held that Judjre
Kirkpatrick of New Jersey went into
evjery phase of the Question and heard
every Interest before he acted, and that
the present contest, eo far as his adver
saries are concerned, i* but part of a well
planned programme for delay.
Assurances That the Union Iron
"Works Will Continue Work
y * Even if Receiver
Controls.
Serious Questions Presented
by Attorneys Pillsbury
and Wollman.
Attorney Wollman grew fervent in his
statement that the plan . of the [ reorgani
zation committee was a dishonest one ( an4
he appealed to the court to appoint Senator
Smith receiver, in order. that an honest
plan ' may be developed and Innocent
stockholders be protected. He spoke very
fast and to the point, reiterating no point
that he had once made. ' He said:
If the Mercantile Trust Company, had not
been under the absolute domination of Schwab's
SAYS PLAN IS DISHONEST.
Judge LJndley followed Mr. Pillsbury
and argued the question of this court's
jurisdiction over the United States Ship
building Company and quoted many au
thorities to refute thoso submitted by Mr.
Pillsbury.
Attorney Henry Wollman defended Mr.
Scott, though Scott and he had not dis
cussed the matter of accepting the posi
tion of agent of the receiver.- Mr. Pills
bury reiterated that he did not think that
Scott would refuse the position, as he
would be well paid, since- the receiver is
always highly remunerated.
"But, says Mr. Scott, receivers are not
regarded with favor, in this community,"
added Mr. Pillsbury.
WOLLMAN DEFENDS SCOTT.
Mr. Scott might be tempted to accept the po
dtlon of agent by the offer of a big salary. I
am sure he would not object to such a remu
nerative position. ... -;; : j
Mr. Pillsbury expressed the belief that
Mr. Nixon was behind the complainants
in their attempts to have a receiver ap
pointed. He said no benefit would come to
the Union Iron "Works by thC appointment
of a receiver. â¢ He pointed out that the at
torneys for the complainants. had not at
tempted to palliate it. He quoted extracts
from testimony given by Henry T. Scott
last week. He said:
. Now. Mr. Scott was asked If a receiver, was
appointed would he (Scott) not act as his
â¢gent and try to keep â¢ the ship
yard going, and he- replied that, he
would. But Mr. Scott Is protesting against
the appointment of a receiver. He is the ex
ecutive officer of the Union Iron Works and
bis position Is delicate. But Mr. Scott It not
the Union Iron Works. Â»ie Is merely a di
rector. Mr. Scott would simply become an"
agent of this receiver and the receiver the rep.
resentative of the United States Shipbuilding
Company. . .
"Whatever order I make will be made
with the qualification y that it can be
opened at any time," interrupted Judge
Beatty.
Mr. Pillsbury continued as fellows with
out interruption:
If in your 'conscience you can see no good
can be accomplished by such appointment
your Honor must certainly deny it: Suppose
your / Honor made a qualified appointment.
You would do no pood to anybody, but would
Jeopardize the situation. Immediately the
United States Government would make Inquiry.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company would
ask what is the Eituation here? I would say,
the court has appointed a receiver . and it
will be necessary to put a receiver In the
works, which will cause delay In preparing
your Â«teamchiDÂ« for service. Then the super
intendent of the company would say, "Xo
more ships of the Pacific Mall will go into
the Union Iron Works â we cannot take any
chances." In other words, your Honor, you
can prevent Injury to Innocent people If you
decline now to make -any appointment. We
are perfectly willing that you do It without
prejudice, with a right to renew it at any
time. If you do the condition will be this:
The Union Iron Works will be uncrammeled,
unaffected; but If you take a formal recog
nition of the complainant's petition you do
Injury, necessarily and Inevitably. Suppose
your Honor recognizes . the receiver here. The
of fleers of the United " States Government are
directed to take the receipts from the Union
Iron Work*. To whom will they pay the
money, to your Honor? Just as quick as this
application comes up there will be trouble. I
say it is the only safe course. . It Is an ex
ceptionally happy eituation for your Honor,
because there Is no obligation or trouble about
it. By failing to act you can do uo harm.
You hold the situation. You protect the In
nocent, you protect the Union Iron Works,
which Is not a party to these proceedings, and
you protect the rights, of all who have a
claim to the protection of this court.
NIXON BEHIND PROCEEDINGS.
Mr. Pillsbury argued that the appoint
ment of a receiver would be detrimental
to the interests of all concerned in the
property and affairs of the defendant, the
United States Shipbuilding Company, and
further because the property aff-cted is
under lease and because the appointment
of a receiver would be contrary to equity.
The Mercantile Trust Company's coun
sel wanted the court to deny the appli
cation without prejudice. "I desire, your
Honor, to hold this situation just as it
Is at present," said Mr. Pillsbury. "and
thus safeguard the rights of everybody."

ts affairs, or to appoint a receiver con-
cerning the. same.
The attorney said that the appointment
of a receiver was unnecessary. He based
this statement on the fact that his client,
the Mercantile Trust Company, had filed
Its b!!l in the Circuit Court and com
menced a suit on Julj r 22. 1903, for the
foreclosure of a mortgage upon the prop
erly of the defendant, and procured a sub
pena and made service of the same on
the Union Iron "Works. He said this was
prior to the commencement of the pres
ent proceedings to have a receiver ap
pointed, and his clients are therefore en
titled to the appointment of such receiver
if such action is deemed necessary by the
court, as the claims of the Mercantile
Trust Company are superior to those of
complainants.
OPPOSED TO RECEIVER.
W. J. Dutton will be the chairman of
the executive committee of the Mer
chants* Exchange for the current year.
E. W. Hopkins heads the committee on
finances, J. A. Hooper the committee on
arbitration, Henry F. Allen the commit
tee on appeals, R. D. GIrvin the commit
tee on grain. R. P. Scnwerin the com
mittee on trade and commerce. H. Sher
wood the membership committee, F. H.
Wheelan the information and statistics
committee, W. A. Soule the floor commit
tee and Juda Newman the committee on
margin fund. These anouncements ' were
made at a meeting of the newly elected
board of directors that was held yester
day.
This fs a great year for the exchange.
Construction work on the bis: building on
California and LeldsdorfT streets will be
far advanced. The grain business will
have some changes in rules, especially ap
plicable to warehousing. More than the
ordinary interest has therefore attached
to the annual selection of the commit
tees, which, in their respective fields, do
a large amount of work for the entire
exchange. The new grain rules that have
already been published have not been
adopted, but have been recommended and
will undoubtedly go into force soon. The
entire membership of the standing com
mittees of the exchange for the year Is as
follows:
Some months ago the sugar-pine men
formed an association in this city, which
has since served as a \ medium for-, all
sales of pine lumber from their various
mills. Now the redwood men purpose to
go a step farther and organize themselves
Into a small sized trust. During the last
two years the price of California c.'ear
redwood at the mill has steadily ad
vanced from $18 to $30 a thousand, and
the main idea of the proposed truÂ«t Is
to maintain this price. The four firms
mentioned are the biggest factor in the
sale of California redwood 'and can eas
ily effect a combine that will "have no
dangerous competitor in this State if
thej^see fit to agree upon terms.
Their interests, with those of the Nel
son Company, He entirely within Hum
boldt and Mendoclno counties, the rich
est timber section of the State. Ham
mond has about 75,000 acres; Smith, wfio
is supposed to be . backed by the Santa
Fe Company, has 50,000 acres; Johnson.
40.000 acres; and Nelson, whose company
only recently purchased for $1,000,000 the
Korbel tract and consolidated It with Its
Riverside property. Is supposed- to con
trol about 25.000 acres. Nelson .was not
In the original plans for the 'consolidation
of interests, but was Invited to :Joln the
other big holders of timber land aftCi* he
had acquired possession of the- Korbel
tract and was In a position to annpy*
them should they carry out their
project.
Although Messrs. Johnson, Smith and
Hammond have been endeavoring to
keep their movements a secret, it was
learned yesterday that they have been
holding frequent meetings at the Palace
Hotel and the office of Hammond &
Smith of late and have been making
steady progress toward a permanent com
bine. Their plan is to establish an* ov
flee for the four companies in this city,
independent of the regular oOTces of- the
concerns, and through this office transact
all business pertaining to the sale of the
lumber product of their respective mills In
the north. - -
The owners of the big redwood timber
tracts In Northern California are plan
ning to pool their interests with a view of
securing control of thÂ» market and regu
lating the prices to suit themselves.
Among the more prominent factors in
the move are C. R. Johnson of the Union
Lumber Company; Hyram C. Smith,
president of the Pacific Lumber # Com
pany; A. B. Hammond, president of the
Hammond Lumber Company, and Charles
Nelson of the Nelson Lumber Company.
Among them the companies, represented
and practically owned by the men men
tioned, control the output of California
redwood. tnelr annual cutting amounting
to about 70 per cent of the total number
of feet cut. in this State.
It was testified by Jacob Eppinger that
the firm was organized in DIxon, Solano
County, in 1868, and that the partners
were Jacob Eppinger, Herman Eppinger
and Bernhard Ettllnger. Otto Fox and
Schulze of Dixon had an interest in the
firm for a period. Here his memory
failed him and he could not tell when
Schulze went out of the concern. Jacob
Eppinger, so he testified, did most of the
buying of grain for the firm. It was de
veloped by the testimony that Jacob Ep
pinger engaged in some private specula
tions, but he said that these were intend
ed for the benefit of the firm.
When Attorney Friedenrich asked who
had charge of the financial part of the
business of Eppinger & Co. Attorney Ach
interposed and instructed the witness
that he could stand on his constitutional
rights and refuse to answer. Â¦
Attorney Friedenrich grew sarcastic
and said that "all one has to do is to com
mit a crime and seal his lips against
the bankruptcy court. While the honest
man has to disclose his business, the dis
honest man may escape."
There was considerable argument. Ref
eree Green finally decided that as Jacob
Eppinger had been indicted in the State
court he need Â¦ not answer who was the
financial head of Eppinger & Co.
Mr. Frledenrich asked Jacob Eppinger
whether he knew when the firm was
making or losing money in any particular
year. His answer was that he could tell
within $100,000 in any year by observation,
but he could not estimate any closer than
that. He never had given any order to
have the making up of a trial balance
omitted. He never gave any order con
cerning a balance sheet down to 1903. He
never prepared a statement of checks
drawn^for him and not entered up; nor
had he examined the books of Eppinger
& Co. to ascertain the total amount' of
such checks. He did not know how much
money he personally drew from 18D3 to
1903 nor how much he drew In May, 1903.
His losses had been $188,000 since 1897.
The testimony of the witness was of
the general hazy and Indefinite sort indi
cated py the foregoing. Attorney Henry
Ach was present and advised Jacob Ep
pinger not to answer certain questions on
the ground that the answers might tend
to incriminate him, Jacob being under In
dictment. "
Jacob -Eppinger . testified before Milton
Green, referee In bankruptcy, yesterday
that the. business of Eppingrer & Co. ran
into millions of dollars, but that no bal
ance sheet of the business had been made
since 18S3. "Whenever he needed funds for
his personal use he instructed his son.
Joe Eppinger, to draw checks. Joe did as
he^ was directed and sometimes Frank
Mitchell, the bookkeeper, might also have
been instructed to draw checks for Jacob
Eppinger'a use.
Other statements made by Jacob Ep
j>lnger were of more than common Inter
est to the . creditors j of Eppinger & Co..
who were represented by attorneys. For
instance. Jacob Epplnger testified that
Joe Eppinger had overdrawn his salary
to the amount of $1000 per month for a
considerable period and that between JCO,
000 and 170,000 had been charged up
against Joe Eppinger on this account.
Jacob also testified that he had lost about
$57,000 since September. 1902. He borrowed
$30,000 on his life Insurance policy of $50.
000 and gave hla wife $5000. He borrowed
$7000 from Rosen t eld & Co., $7000 from his
wife and $5000 from the "Wells, Fargo &
Co. Bank. The sums drawn by him on
personal checks amounted to more than
$170,000. He could not tell how much more
without seeing the books of Eppinger &
Co.

BABY'S ECZEMA
Top of Head Covered with Scales
Which Peeled off Taking
'/â¢>-- Hair with. Them.
CURED BY CUTICURA
"My baby was about six weeks old
when the top of her head became cor-
ered with thtck scales, which would
peel and come off, taking the hair with
* It. It would soon form again and b>as
bad as before. I tried sereral tilings aad
..then went to the doctor. He said It was
Eczema, and prescribed an ointment,
which did not do any good. A friend
* spoke of Caticnra Soap, I tried It and
read on the wrapper about Cutlcura
Ointment as a remedy for Eczema. I
bought a box and washed her head in
warm water and Caticura Soap and
gently combed the scales off. They did
not come back and her hair grew out
. line and thick. She Is now a year and
a half old and has no trace of Eczema.
Tou hare my permission to publish my
