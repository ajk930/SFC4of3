TjT ONDON, Sept. 19.â It
B is not surprising to find
B that cold water is al
ready thrown on the
story of the massacre at Kastoria.
The Monastir correspondent of
the Daily Mail, who is strongly
opposed to the Turks and who
was threatened with expulsion re
cently, telegraphs thus:
"It appears that the first mas
sacre at Kastoria . occurred Au
gust 7, when seventy Christians
were murdered.: All villages in
thcÂ«4district- have since been laid
waste."

PARIS, Sept. 18.â Unofficial but reliable
information has been received here to the
effect that the proposed congress of the
powers for the purpose of revising the
Geneva convention.^ establishing the right
and treatment of prisoners of war, neu
trals," wounded etc., which was to have
taken place shortly, probably will be In
definitely postponed. France, Great Brit
ain, Italy, Austria and Russia named
delegates, but Germany has not named a
delegate, as it is understood that she
does not desire any change in the present
status of prisoners of war, etc., during a
state of belligerency. Therefore, in the
absence of a general international accept
ance of the proposal to revise the rules
of war, the meeting of the congress has
been practically given up.

SOFIA, Sept. 18. â A
severe fight has oc
curred at Ulavitsa, in
the mountains of Krat
ovo, between 2000 Turks and 80
insurgents. It continued for eight
hours. The insurgents used
bombs with deadly effect. About
1000 Turks are reported to have
been killed and many more
wounded. The insurgents had
two men wounded.
A fight is also reported to have
taken place at Ruhelpase, near
Ceres, insurgent bands recently,
surrounding and annihilating a
whole company of Turks. The
bands then fled to the mountains.
Three battalions of Turkish
troops have been sent from Sa

"On this understanding as to <our
views," Mr. Chamberlain concludes, "I
wish the league success and the support
of every one desiring the union of the
empire and the continued prosperity of
British commerce."
Consternation and excitement caused
by the announcement of Chamberlain's
resignation of the Secretaryship of the Col
onies prevails among all classes in the
United Kingdom to the exclusion of every
other topic. The great majority of the
public only learned the news from morn
ing papers and their astonishment In
many cases was so great as to prevent
the expression of any coherent opinion.
The Pall Mall Gazette this afternoon
apparently sums up the general feeling
by describing the present crisis as the
"most extraordinary in the whole history
of constitutional government," adding
that what will happen next no one caw.
"I agree with your views that we have
sufficient material in the way of facts
and figures. We have now to state our
conclusions and endeavor to get the peo
ple to adopt them."
Mr. Chamberlain then gives his under
standing of the position of' the Tariff Re
form League under two heads as coin
ciding with his position. Their objects,
he says, "are, first, a closer union to en
deavor to make the empire self-sufficing
as regards its food supply; second, the
employment of a tariff as a weapon to
secure greater reciprocity with foreign
nations; or failing such arrangements to
prevent the Ioes to the home industrial
markets under the competition of pro
tected countries by retaliating upon them
the treatment they mete out to us."
UNION HIS PURPOSE.
LONDON. Sept 16.â Writing to-day
from his home at Highbury, Birm
ingham, Mr. Chamberlain made his
first official statement since his
resignation. His letter Is in reply to C.
A. Parson, chairman of the executive
council of the Tariff Reform League, who
asked if Mr. Chamberlain coincides with
his view that the examination of the tar
iff may be considered as sufficiently ad
vanced and that the league should now
use its resources to advocate the employ
ment of a tariff for the purpose of con
solidating and defending the resources of
the empire and defending the industries
of the United Kingdom. Mr. Chamber
lain says:

Reported Slain in
Battle.
forecast with any degree of absolute cer
tainty.
The Pall Mall Gazette states that Pre
mier Balfour will fill up the vacancies and
carry on the Government until he meets
Parliament in 1004. Mr. Chamberlain,
also, does not look for an immediate gen
eral election, expecting at least a twelve
months' propaganda before the electorate
can decide upon his proposals. Other ru
mors are current that Mr. Balfour is un
able to find men to fill the vacancies and
that he will be obliged to hand the King
his own resignation. This, however, does
not appear to be. likely.
MILNER TO THE TORE.
The Westminster Gazette and other pa
pers forecast Lord Milner, the High
Commissioner in South* Africa, succeed
ing to the Colonial Office, and it is def
initely announced that Lord Stanley,
Financial Secretary t6 the War Office,
and probably James Lowther, Deputy
Speaker, will be among those promoted
to the Cabinet, but the details of its rec
ommendation are not likely to be known
until Mr. Balfour has seen the King.
Almost every paper has its own candi
date for the various vacant offices, but
few of the papers agree. The attitude of
the Duke of Devonshire, Lord President
of the Council, being unknown to the pub
lic causes further uncertainty. Lord
Rothschild's statement yesterday, how
ever, can safely be taken as an indication
that the Duke Intends to support Mr.
Balfour, at any rate until Parliament
meets.
The prediction that the markets would
not be affected by the Cabinet crisis has
been fulfilled; indeed, consols exhibited a
firmer tone. From all parts of the United
Kingdom and the empire editorial expres
sions of opinion on the crisis are pouring
in. The Government organs frankly ad
mit that Mr. Chamberlain's withdrawal
came as a bombshell. The Liberal
organs, though announcing the '/wreck of
the Tory party," which is described as
being "Hamlet" without the Prince,
nearly all agree in saying that Mr. Cham
berlain's resignation does ' not mean (vic
tory for free trade.

ASTORIA, Sept. 18.â The British ships
Musselcrag and Pegasus, which sailed
some months ago for South African port3
from Astoria, had terrible experiences on
the trip, according to a letter received to
day from Captain Robinson of the former
vessel. Typhoons were encountered, and
for days the fate of the Pegasus hung in
the balance. She lost three of her life
boats and two sailors were washed Into
the sea and drowned. Heavy seas swept
the vessel fore and aft, and she was in
danger of foundering. She arrived at
Cape Town in a disabled condition.
The Musselcrag reached Algoa Bay
after losing two of her boats and jettison
ing forty togs of her grain cargo. Among
her men was one who had been shang
haied from this port under the namje of
A. Anderson. He had been taken aboard
by Paddy Lynch, now serving a long term
in the penitentiary for kidnaping, who
asked him if he wished to view the ship.
He was never taken ashore, but accepted
the situation philosophically and signed
articles after getting to sea.

LONDON", Sept. 18. â A member of The Call-Herald staff to-day had
a conversation with a well-known Londoner, who has been behind
the scenes in British politics for many years past, and who said
an idea was prevalent that Mr. Chamberlain's resignation is part
of a very carefully thought-out scheme.
"Austen Chamberlain," said this authority, "is going to remain in
the Cabinet and the father's voice is bound to be heard through the
son.
"It is almost certain there will be a general election when the Lib
erals will come into power, but the Liberals cannot count on a long
tenure of office. Then there will be a turn in the tide, and Mr. Cham
berlain will be carried on the flood to the Premiership."
This theory is of course purely speculative, and omits all consider
ation of Mr. Chamberlain's loyalty, on which Balfour in. his letter laid
such stress, but it is worth recording as the view of a personage who is
as well versed in politics as any man in London.

one of the rnen who took part in the

with hastening the tragedy. Captain

FRESNO. Seut. 13.â But for the assist
ance of the Fresno Fire Department this
morning, which violated rules by doing
work outside the city limits, all "Russian
town" would be in ashes. As it was the
houses of Peter Leider and Mike Mitz
ler, their barns and a barn belonging to
Adam Johanes were completely destroyed.
The fire took place just across the city
limits line and Chief Ward saw that a
few minutes' work by his men would save
thousands of dollars' worth of property
from being destroyed, so he sent the men
over the line. They worked just long
enough to stop the progress of the flames.
The property loss is estimated at from
52500 to $3000, covered, by insurance.

Colombia the cruiser Presidente" Pinto in
exchange for Colombia's support at the
Pan-American Congress, held at the city
of Mexico in October, 1901.
President Caro's policy, it is asserted, is
to attack the Colombian Government by

the Chilean treaty, is aimed also at Vice

The Foreign Office has no Intimation
regarding the rumor of the assassination
of the King of Servia. The report reach
ed the Bourse here through an agency
dispatch from Antwerp, saying a report
that the King had been assassinated was
current there, and it caused considerable
excitement and depression on the Bourse,
owing to the, absence of official informa
tion. The report was eventually attrib
uted to the excited conditions prevailing
at Belgrade. The evening newspapers
here published the report, but did not at
tach any seriousness to It.
PARIS,. Sept. 18.â A dispatch from Bel
grade states that the report of the assas
sination of King Peter of Servians with
out foundation.
Official advices from Belgrade Indicate
that King Peter's recent retirement of
Colonel Nichtich from the important posi
tion of Departmental Chief In the Minis
try for War Is the beginning of a move
ment looking to the separation of King
Peter from the conspirators who took
part In the assassination of King Alex
ander and Queen Draga. Nichtich, the
leader of Â¦ the conspiracy, was conspic
uously honored and Is now degraded as
the result of widespread Indignation at
the favor shown by the King toward the
participants in the assassination.

says the elections for members of the
Skupshtlna next Monday promise to re
sult in a majority favorable to the sepa

LONDON, Sept. 18.â A direct dispatch
received here from Belgrade says:
"The report of the assassination of
King Peter is entirely unfounded."
VIENNA, Sept. 18.â As far as is known
here there is not the slightest reason to
suppose that King. Peter of Servia has
been assassinated.
LONDON, Sept. 13.- When the Alaskan
Boundary Commission resumed its ses
sions to-day Attorney General Flnlay
was subjected by War Secretary Root
and Senators Lodge and Turner to a
fire of questions in connection with his
attempt to show that the boundary
should run from the head of Portland
Canal directly westward to the point
where the mountains, claimed by the Ca
nadians as the boundary. Intersect the
fifty-sixth parallel of latitude.
The contention of the United States Is
that the boundary continues up to Bear
River Valley, from the head of Portland
Canal to the llfty-eighth parallel. In
this connection Mr. Root called the At
torney General's attention to the fact
that Vancouver referred to Marsely Pass
as the head of the canal, and asked If it
was not natural to suppose that the sig
natories of the treaty Intended to follow
the Pass of the fifty-sixth degree.
The Attorney General replied that the
line under the treaty could not run far
ther than the water canal and from that
point must seek the mountains at the
fifty-sixth parallel. Senator Lodge sug
gested that this would mean that the line
must cross the mountains to reach those
points described in the Canadian case,
which the Attorney General evaded
touching upon.
The Attorney General passed during
the afternoon to the discussion of the
location of the line between the fifty
sixth parallel to Mount St. Ellas, assert
ing that if the contention of the United
States that the boundary should go
around the heads of inlets was admitted,
then correspondingly Canada should gain
by the tribunal deciding that â¢ the line
should follow ten marine leagues from
the shores of peninsulas.
Judge John M. Dickinson of American
counsel said the United States was con
tending only for the heads of inlets and
not beyond, the Attorney General having
raised the point that the American claim
for tidewater as the boundary might put
the boundary far into the Interior of
Canada.

Emperor Francis Joseph met Emperor

The criticism of the Email effect upon
the Government policy caused by Mr.
Chamberlain's withdrawal, and of the re
tention of h's son, is not confined to the
opposition. The St. James Gazette, which
warmly supports Mr. Chamberlain's pro

the "Unionist party will face the electors
disunited and open to all the attacks of
the free-fooders=. as it will be perfectly
apparent to the eiectors that the return
of Mr. Balfour involves sooner or later
the return cf Mr. Chamberlain and the
triumph of his policy."
Mr. Balfour has reitprated to friends
that his letter to Mr. Chamberlain was
not a formal expression regarding Mr.
Chamberlain's policy, but that he meant
what he eaid. On the Tace of it Mr.
Chamberlain and Mr. Balfour will con

"Everyman" to Be Given at Stanford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. 15.â
Tl>at Ben Greet's production of "Every
man" and "Twelfth Night" Is to meet
Â»!th an enthusiastic reception by the uni
versity community was evidenced by thÂ»
rush this morninz to secure tickets for
the performances. The p!ays will be given
under the auspices of the Stanford Eng
lish Ciub. "Everyman" will be presented
on Monday evening and "Twelfth Night'
on Tuesday evening. It is expected that
a larcc number of people will come from
nÂ«arby towns to witness the productions.
The four great timber-using industriesâlum
bering, building, mining and transportation â
are r>ecullarly dependent for their future pros
perity upon a sustained supply of timber from
the Government forest reserves and special pro
visions must be made to pieet their needs. {The
use of the mature timber is often essential and
almost universally advisable in a healthy grow
ing forest, and provision 1Â» made by the law
for Its disposition to those who need it. This
use of the reserves will grow steadily greater
and more essential as time goes on, and every
care phould be takn to safeguard the young
frowtb for the future.
In thÂ«? delicate and important task of ad
ministering the forest reserves, which are bo
vitally necessary to the well being of Indus
tries and communities throughout the West,
the Government is constantly met by the de
mands of conflicting Interests. In Its endeavor
to make the reserves as useful as possible to
all the people these interests must be most
carefully considered. In the region about a
particular reserve, Rheep grazing maybe the
most important industry, and therefore thÂ»
first to be protected and conserved. In another^
stock raising of other kinds may predominate.
In the ET*at majority, the Interests of the
email rancher and the irrigator come first. In
each case it is essential that the administra
tion of the reserve should meet the needs of
the people, and that each reserve should be
given its highest possible present usefulness
while protecting with the greatest care its con
tinued utility to the community. The Idea of
permanent usefulness is fundamental In every
case. *
CONFLICTING INTERESTS.
El Paso won out in its picturesque fight
for next year's congress on the first
ballot. There was a desperate effort
made by the Northwestern States to
bring the honor to Boise, but it was un
successful, and but one ballot was neces
sary. It was apparent that the desire to
go to Portland, Or., in 1905 had much to
do with this action in giving the honor
for 1304 to the Southwest.
Many delegates left for their homes to
night, although several hundred will go
on excursions to-morrow through Cache
Valley, viewing the State Agricultural
School at Logan and the great irrigation
works of the Bear River Valley.
On the suggestion .of Chief Engineer
Newell and the Government engineers,
only three of the addresses on the pro
gramme for to-day were delivered in or
der to give more time for discussion on
the land laws questions. All the other
addresses and papers of the Government
experts will be printed In the official pro
ceedings of the congress. The following
addresses were delivered: "Forest ana
Water Supply," by F. II. Newell, chief
engineer United States Government;
"Forestry," by Gifford Pinchot, chief
forester United States Government,
"Forest Reservations in Utah," by A. F.
Potter, Government forestry expert.
Pinchofs address was in part as follows:
President Roosevelt has said that the princi
pal object of the forest policy of the United
States Is, and n:uÂ«t be, to make prosperous
homes and to keep them prosperous. The ob-
JÂ«-ei of the Government in dealing with the
Jorest reserves Is, therefore, to give them their
greatest permanent usefulness to the settler
and the home-maker. Accordingly the officers in
charge of the administration of forest reserves
must acquaint themselves fully and completely
with the needs of the people in each locality,
as the most essential step toward the proper
management of each reserve. Wise forest ad
ministration Is impossible without a knowledge
of local conditions and local needs, and with
out the careful adaptation of the forest reserve
rules to meet those needs.
Over the adoption or rejection of the
clauses of the majority report requesting
that Congress repeal the desert land act,
the timber and stone act and the com
mutatio hclause of the homestead act
occurred a debate of four hours' dura
tion, exceedingly bitter at times and par
ticipated in by some of the most promi
nent men in the work of irrigation. The
opposition to the National Irrigation Con
gress committing itself in any such man
ner was led by former Senator Carey of
Wyoming, Congressman Mondell of Wy
oming and former Congressman Shafroth
of Colorado, and when a substitute for
these provisions of the majority report
was offered by Congressman Needham ot
California, simply requesting Congress to
modily the land laws, the whole strength
of the opposition was thrown in its favor.
The result Is regarded by them as a de
cided victory, in that the national body
of irrigationists did not come out in di
rect opposition to the laws they so
strongly defended. The debate was pro
longed until evening, and although a
number of interesting papers were to
have been presented by bureau chiefs of
the Department of Agriculture, the con
gress, tired out by the long and at times
acrimonious discussion, adjourned with
out listening to them.

was called and resulted in the adoption
of the Needham resolution by a vote of
212 to 113.
Congressman Brooks of Colorado of
fered several other amendments to the
majority report relating to State and na

on the ground that they are inconsistent
with the national Irrigation laws. The
majority report, as amended, was then
carried by a viva voce vote. Â¦'-Â»"

The report of the committee on resolu

and the delegates settled themselves
for the big fight of the congress.
Before debate on the report of the com
mittee on resolutions was taken up at the
afternoon session an amendment to the
majority report was made, commending
the plan of State commissions, such as
exists in Utah, to work in collaboration
with the Government in the great irriga

the Oregon Short Line for its courtesies,
and to Utah, the city of Ogden and the
press were also adopted. A motion to
limit the time of debate to three speakers
on each side, giving- each speaker fifteen
minutes, was adopted.
Former Congressman Shafroth of Colo

drance to the usefulness of the reserves;
third, the sudden disturbance of business con
ditions when a reserve is created has some
times in the past occasioned serious losses to
legitimate business enterprises. When, as
sometimes happens, the continued use of an
area set aside as a forest reserve as it was
used before is no longer compatible with the
public interests, then, unless the public Jjood
absolutely demands sudden action, which is
but rarely the case, these private enterprises
should be given time to adjust themselves to
the approaching change.
When ignorance of the objects of forest re
serves disappears, opposition to them disap
pears with it. It Is gratifying: in the highest
degree that the opposition to the forest reserve
policy of the Government, at one time so ex
tensive and important throughout the West,
has almost entirely disappeared. The West is
now practically united in support of the forest
reserves. Occasionally opposition still appears
where private interests or private desires con
flict with the best good of the people as a
wholo. or where ignorance of the forest re
serve policy yet remains, but general opposi
tion to that policy no longer exists in any
State. The sentiment in favor of the protec
tion of water and of other Interests in the
West, through the protection of its forests,
awaits but the adjustment of a few differences
to become unanimous.

Improves, but for the present a serious hin-
â¢There are two other mills operating
upon the slopes of Upper Pescadero
Creek. â¢ One is known Â»as the Ryder mill
and the other the Carmichael. It is evi
dent that within a few years the red
woods in' yjis section will be nearly all
destroyed.
The superintendent of the timber com
pany has had a survey made for a wagon
road down the Pescadero Valley to the
lands. of the San Mateo Water Company,
commonly known as Moore's place; thence
the present wagon road leads out to the
Alpine road to Menlo Park. He has also
had his" men clear a good trail for the
same distance. It is commonly reported
in the Pescadero region that this same
company .proposes to establish other mills
farther down the valley and that the
wagon. road survey has been<made with a
view to rendering the sites of such new
mills available.
At the present time the machinery has
been installed and is being run for the
purpose â¢ of manufacturing lumber with
which to erect the superstructure of the
mill Itself. About 125 men are employed,
but this number will be increased as soon
es operations have been begun in ear
nest.
MACH1NEBY IS INSTALLED.
A dam has been placed across Water
man Creek and a good sized ' mill
pond created. The mill is located on the
sidehill above this pond. No longer are
the logs hauled to the mill by teams of
gigantic oxen. A good sized donkey en
gine at the end of a skidway Is equipped
with two immense cylinders, upon which
wire cables are colled. The light cable Is
intended for hauling the heavy cable out
to the end of the skidway, which may be
a mile away up some gulch. The heavy
cable is then made fast to a row of im
mense logs fastened end to end by iron
chains. - A signal is given by the man In
charge of the log train, which at once
begins. its journey to the mill. At a cer
tain point the logs are uncoupled and
rolled into the mlllpond. A steam eleva
tor quickly raises the logs to the mill.
In which they are rapidly cut into board
measure. The mill has a .capacity of
60,000 feet per day.
The company Is the natural successor
of the syndicate which disposed of the Big
Basin grant to the State of California.
Having cut nearly all the timber In the
Boulder Creek region, except that con
tained in the 3900 acres sold to the State,
the syndicate either had to quit business
or seek new fields. ' As It happened the
Boulder Creek logging railroad reached
within a few miles of the San Ma^eo
County line and the headwaters of Pes
cadero Creek and all that was necessary
for the members of the syndicate to do
was to move their outfits over the ridge
separating Boulder Creek from Pesca
dero Creek and to begin operations in the
almost virgin forest of the Pescadero.
This they have done. They have buiit
a fine, wagon road across the San Mateo
County line and to a point in the south
eastern corner of section 22 on Waterman
Creek. Here they have installed one of
the most complete lumber plants in Cal
ifornia.
WAGON ROADS ARE BUILT.
REDWOOD CITY, Sept. 18.â The
days of the redwood trees
which have made famous
the valley through which
Pescadero Creek runs are
numbered. The principal owner of
the timber lands in the valley is Timo
thy Hopkins, who purchased them twenty
years ago at an average price of about
$12 50 per acre. He and his associates
own the larger portion of a thickly tim
bered . region more than eight miles long.
The land Is situated directly eouth of La
Honda and beyond what is known as the
Alpine Ridge. The Spring Valley Water
Works Company owns 640 acres in the
neighborhood and with the old San Fran
cisco Water Company controls the prin
cipal water rights of the Pescadero
Creek. There are also a few individual
owners of scattering parcels of land, but
the syndicate of capitalists of whom
Timothy Hopkins is the leader practically
controls the region. For twenty years
these capitalists have been holding the
timber arid have neither made any ef
fort to market it themselves nor have
they been willing to sell to others. With
Interest added the property now stands
them about $25 per acre, a price higher
than much of the surrounding property
will bring in open market at the present
time.
At last, however, the high price of lum
ber has tempted the capitalists and the
first energetic effort is now being made
to place the timber of the upper Pesca
dero Creek upon the market. The Cali
fornia Timber Company has been formed,
with H. L. Middleton. the lumber kins
of Boulder Creek region, at the head of
the corporation. This company has tak
en over the holdings of Middleton and a
portion of the land held by Mrs. W. H.
Dougherty of SaiFJose. It is further un
derstood that it either has or will control
the holdings of Timothy Hopkins and the
Other associates with him.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1903.
Opposition to the forest reserve policy has
arisen chiefly from three sources â first, mis
understanding of the Government's policy in
the creation of reserves; second, Vfxatious
and unnecessary delays and restrictions or-
SOURCES OF OPPOSITION.
For the present much the most important
use of the forest reserves Is to supply water
to the lrrlgator. and their utility In this respect
should be safeguarded In every possible way.
This use, too, will Increase with time, and It
will become n-.ore and more evident that the
foundation of the irrigation development of the
West lies in the wise administration of the
forest reserves. Not only can the present sup
plies of water be conserved by the rlsrht hand
ling- of the foie-t, but there is no questian wrat
ever that In many localities they may b*
largely Increased. From this point of view, as
well as from many others, protection against
fire is the first duty of the Government toward
the reserves. '< Â¦

SUMMER SCHOOL
IS A SUCCESS
President Dailey Files
Report at Meeting
of Trustees.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Sept. 18.â The State Nor
mal School Trustees met here yesterday,
Trustees Addison, Mastick, Jacobs, Dow
and Babb and State Superintendent Kirk
and President Dailey being present.
The board decided to contract with the
Standard Oil Company for 1000 barrels of
oil for heating the school at 75 cents per
barrel. Dr. Dow, one of the local Trus
tees, had already made arrangements with
the Associated Oil Company .for the same
quantity at 82 cents per barrel. The l>oard
unanimously repudiated the arrangement
made by Trustee Dow and accepted' the
Standard Company's offer.
The salary of Miss Belle Mackenzie,
head of the kindergarten department, waa
raised to $1500 per year.'
President Dailey filed a report showing
that the summer school just closed was
a success. There was an attendance of
175. which was considered large for the
first term. He recommended that here
after the session of the summer school
be six weeks instead of ten. The recom
mendation was adoDted.
It was expected that an attempt would
be made to elect Professor C. W. Childs,
a former principal of the Normal School,
vice principal. Childs waa . deposed - by
Governor Budd. Professor W. W. Wil
son is at present vice principal. 'Childs
has been after the position for some time
and has many influential friends. The
rules provide that the president of the
school shall nominate the teachers.
Friends of Childs had secured an opin
ion that this was not necessary and be
lieved that they had the Trustees pro
grammed for Childs' election.
It is said that a decision sent down
yesterday by Governor Pardee upset their
programme, as the Attorney General has
held that the nomination must come from
President Dailey, and the latter refuses to
make the nomination.

Chris Anderson, the proprietor of the

bers might have made a larger haul. The
leader of the highwaymen was more than
Bix feet tall and well proportioned. The

robbers left the place the ' Sheriff's of
fice was notified. Deputies Starbird.
Dreischmeyer and Bache were on the
scene inside of fifteen minutes, but no
trace of the highwaymen could be found.
It Is believed the men must have had a
rig near; by in which to make their es
cape.
Shortly before 10 o'clock a young man
about 23 years of age entered and pur
chased a drink. A few minutes later he
returned with two companions.
"Throw up your hands," ordered one
who appeared to be the leader, and in
rtantly ten hands Ehot upward. J. F.
Rose, the bartender, was In charge at the
time.
All three robbers wore masks and went
about their work methodically. The lead
Â«*Â¦ was the only one that displayed a re
volver, and he kept all five men, who
had been lined up against the wall, well
covered. The other two thugs did tfie
searching. From the till 514 in coin was
taken. J. F. Rose, the bartender, was

CARSON CITT,.Nev., Sept. 18.â District
Attorney Moody and Sheriff Walher of
Nevada County, California, arrived In this
city to-day to disinter the body of Charles
Calvin, who died at Hobart Mills some
months ago. The purpose of the exhum
ing Is to examine the body and determine
If poison was administered to Calvin. Dr.
Shoemaker of Truckee performed the
work of removing the stomach and Intes
tines from the body, and an examination
for poison will bÂ« made by a chemist In
San Francisco. The party left this even
ing for California with the portion of the
remains that they desired.
Calvin died . under peculiar circum
stances. Dr. Johnson of Hobart Mills,
the place where Calvin died, was the at
tending physician, and it is said he had
been paying secret attention to Mrs. Cal
vin before the death of her husband. The
fact that Calvin was sick but a few days
and was attended by Dr. Johnson created
more or less suspicion. Shortly after the
death of Calvin, Mrs. Calvin and Dr.
Johnson left the place and have been re
ported as living in San Francisco. Dr.
Johnson was married to the daughter of
District Judge Jones of this State. Before
he left her, it is said, he administered a
beating to her and told her to go home
to her mother. Judge Jones on hearing
of the Calvin case came to this city and
started the law in motion to bring the
doctor and Mrs. Calvin to time. The
Judge has announced that he will probe
the matter to the bottom, and . It Is be
lieved that he is instrumental In bringing
about the present action.
All of the parties are well known In this
city, where Mrs. Calvin was raised. She
left her son, a boy of 6 years, to be pro
vided for In this city before her departure.
The entire community Is agog over tho
suspicious circumstances of the entire
affair.
PORTLAND, Or., Sept. 13.â A Prine
vllle, Oregon, special to-day says: S. P.
Donkle, an old settler at the Pelton place,
on the Deschutes River, was murdered
some days ago and his body burled near
hla home by the person or^persons guilty
of the crime. The body, which was ex
humed by the Sheriff and Coroner of
Crook County, showed " that death was
due to a pistol wound behind the left ear.
In order to conceal the crime the mur
derers had built a big fire over. the grave.
The dead man's money was gone, but his
watch was on his person. Mystery sur
rounds'- the case. From the meager de
tails now obtainable, Donkle and his son
were camped on the bank of the river and
were engaged in putting up hay on the
James Pelton ranch. The son left ten
days ago on a cattle round-up and when
he returned Monday learned that 'his
father had disappeared.. Suspecting folil
play he started a search, but no trace of
the miEBirig man could be found for some
time. Finally the son found where the
earth had apparently been disturbed and
a flre built over the mound to divert at
tention. Digging down several feet at
this point a boot was uncovered and it
was found to be on the foot of the miss-
Ing man.

My Wife of Heart
Disease and
Myself of Nervous
Dyspepsia With*
Dr. Miles' Heart Cure
and Nervine.'
If I had but known what medicine and
what physicians were reliable I would be
about fijooo ahead today, For years mj
wife had been troubled with fluttering and
palpitation of the heart accompanied by
weak, nervous spells. We consulted several
different local doctors and tried nearly every
patent medicine I heard of and my wife had
almost given up in despair when my druggist
advised her tp pive Dr. Miles' Heart Cure
and Restorative Nervine a trial. After tak-
ing one-hali bottle of the Nervine sh felt
better than she had in twenty years. She
bought three bottles of each and is todav en-
ioyin? better health than she did in all her
life. I know it is all due to Dr. Miles' Re-
storative Nervine and Sew Heart Cure, I
think Restorative Nervine is the best medi-
cine on earth. As a stomach remedy it can-
not be beaten. It cured me of nervous dys-
pepsia and if from any cause I feel nervous
and I think tay stomach is Â£oine to trouble
me I just take a few doses of Nervine and
Nerve and Liver Pills and I soon feel all
right again. Dr. Miks' Anti-Pain Pills are
the best remedy for headache and pains I
have ever used. I always keep a box in my
house. One Pain Pill will knock any pain
in thirtv minutes. I have been using Dr.
Miles' Restorative Remedies in my family
fifteen years and think they are the best in
the world."â Isaac Headley, Station Mas-

THE tragic finalÂ© of Bizet's opera,
"Carmen." with its love and in
trigue, Its blood and passion,
promises sooner or later to be en-
acted in real life. Such a fore
boding might be commonplace were it not
for the fact that the principal roles in
the cast of realism may be filled by actor3
whose production of the scene of jealousy
and fury under the glare of the calcium
has brought emotion and animation to
many audiences.
Signer Domenico Russo swears to slay
Signorina Estefania Collamarini, not as
he has slain her a thousand times mimic
ally before the footlights, but with the
vindictiveness of a lover driven to madness
by the pangs of desertion. As in the play
an Escamillo has come between these two
gifted people and little Russo with the
blood of a Don Jose In his veins would
have) revense for the loss of his Carmen
at the poniard's point. V '
Many times Russo and Collamarini have
worked side by side through the mimic
situations of playdom. Russo wooes and
wins his love, loses her to the daring
toreador and then appeases his wrath In
murder. Standing at the gates of the
circus at Seville he Implores the fickle
Carmen to return his love. When she re
fuses to hear his prayers he kills her In
despair.
Since leaving this city, where they ap
peared together at the Tlvoll Opera-house,
the story of their lives has been the par
allel of the opera in which they won
plaudits.
RUSSO IS RUINED.
Russo loved and still loves Collamarini.
They found each other years ago and
traveled together from Italy to this coun-
Events have transpired that drove the
tenor to penury and misery and he Is now

John Smith and Dennis O'Brien, ex
convicts and suspected saloon robbers,
were able to present a complete alibi
before Police Judge Fritz yesterday in
regard to the charge of robbery against
them by Harry Elmers, a grocer at 1345
Sacramento street, and' were discharged
from custody. Â»
The Judre remarked that there had
been no hold-ups in saloons since the ar
rest of Smith and O'Brien by Detectives
Dinan and Wren, but he could not legally
take cognizance of that fact as evidence
against the defendants. He also pointed
out that Elmers did not identify either of
the men when he first saw them In the
City Prison and it was not until three
days later that he Identified Smith.
Smith on leaving the courtroom was ar
rested by Detectives Dinan and Wren
and taken back to the City Prison, as

Oakland. He was later taken across the

The demurrer to the petition of Frank
Russo for an order restraining the Board
of Public \ Works from interfering with
his bootblack stand on Seventh and Mis
sion streets was sustained by Judge Sea
well yesterday. He was given ten days
to amend and the temporary restraining
order Issued when the petition was filed
was ordered discharged. The demurrer
was on the ground that the petition did
not state sufficient cause for action.
Sustains Board's Demurrer.
Russo's friends have the greatest sym
pathy for him and are urging .him to for
get the contralto and commence life anew.
This he eays he cannot do and reiterates
his promise to some day or other furnish
the "Carmen" climax in reality.
Nor was this* all of Russo's troubles.
He disco\*ered that Collamarini had given
all his costly wardrobe away and taken
his jewelry, even visiting a Jewelry shop
and securing a watch that he was hav
ing repaired. Then the tenor found him
self without a dollar, but with the aid of
friends came to New York in the steer
age, hoping that he might find the wom
an there and call her to accoun|. When
he landed on the American shores he was
penniless and among strangers and a
search for Collamarini came to naught.
Then he turned toward San Francisco
and arrived a few days ago.
It was whispered that he came to take
a part in the production of "Carmen,"
which is to open at the Ttvoll next week,
but those who heard his words of bitter
denunciation, and yet of love, for the
woman soon found that this was not so.
"She will die like Carmen," he said, "the
first time I meet her on earth. We have
played the part before; then it will be
real." .,â¢ . .
TAKES HIS JEWELRY.
Collamarlni's tastes run in the direction
of glittering gold and fine dress. She
was an expensive companion for Russo,
but he catered - to her every desire and
humored her every whim. What he
earned was hers to dispose of as she
liked.
When the couple left this city they
traveled for a time on tbe road, then
went to Italy. In the country, near Milan,
they purchased a small villa and lived
among the sylvan hills a life of compara
tive peace. Russo never suspected dis
loyalty on the part of the singer and It
was not until recently that he discovered
what portion of her love was given to
him. With the Innocence of a child he
obeyed her command one morning and
started on a Journey to a point fifteen
miles from the villa. When he came back
at nightfall she was gone and with her
a man whose opulence was well kndwn
in Milan.
try. For a time they were parted, but
were reunited in this city and filled an
engagement at the Tivoli. So great was
the tenor's affection lor the contralto that
In Carmen he played with a burning heart
and in an air of reality seldom Imparted
to the theater. In the love parts he was
spontaneous and when the end came he
created a thrilling scene. Every word he
.â¢'poke and every note he sang conveyed
a mersase the depth of which the audi
ence never fully understood. On the
stage as well as In life he worshiped the
woman as a uoddess.
The undercurrent of the entire lecture
was an appeal to the citizens of this city
to save Telegraph Hill. The speaker
pointed out the magnificent view to be
had from this hisrh eminence which over
looks the bay. He told of its history and
also dwelt on the fact that certain con
tractors are gradually tearing away this
landmark. Captain Fletcher appealed to
the citizens to expend some money and
pave this famous spot. He suggested that
it could be fitted up as a park and he be
lieved there was no choicer spot in this
rity for such a purpose. The lecturer
told of the effort? of the women of the
rity to save the hill from destruction.
Mr. Fletcher's lecture was as instructive

of the famed spots of the country were
thrown on a big screen and the audience
applauded fr^-quently.

Divorces for desertion were granted to
Hattle Van Horn from Meldin P. Van
Horn, Mary Boone from Walter S. Boone
and Katherlne M. Shaw from Richard
Shaw.
Desertion Is charged in the complaints
filed by George P. Ralston against Clara
A. Ralston, John Schmitt against Isabel
Schmitt, Jennie Lloyd against Hubert
Lloyd and Hattle B. Sparks against
Frank Sparks. Cruelty is the allegation
in the suits brought by Katharina Braun
ag-ainst John A. Braun nad Luvemle
Shelton against Edward G. Shelton.
Carrie Taylor Schultz is suing W. A.
Schultz Jr. for -divorce on the ground of
Intemperance. She avers that he owns
property on O'Farrel! street and Steuart
street worth $15,000. but is so fond of
liquor that he is incapacitated most of
the time for caring for it, and allows her
to suffer for the bare necessaries of life.
She says he can easily afford to pay her
$100 a month, and she asks the court to
allow that sum as alimony.
Josephine -Beck is the plaintiff In the
suit for divorce brought against Sigmund
Beck. She charges that he has neglected
her for more than a year and has com
pelled her to depend upon the charity of
relatives and friends for her support. She
was Josephine Stein when she married
him in June of last year, and she asks
that she be given a divorce and permis
sion to resume that name.
She says she made the purchases in a j
store directly opposite the hotel. While !
there she was Introduced by the saleslady i
to a gentleman who happened in., She'
chatted for a few moments and then re
turned to her waiting spouse, confident j
that she wvuld receive his praises for her !

played in selecting his wearing apparel, j
She was therefore greatly surprised, she !
says, when her husband in a towering I
rage demanded to know from her how i
many times she had been fn San Jose be- j
fere, and informed her that he had wit- 1
nessed her meeting with the gentleman {
in the store. Shocked and hurt .to think !
that her heretofore loving husband shou!dÂ»|
think that she cared for another â¢
than himself and should display !
such Jea!ousy, says the plaintiff, )
she told him as best she could between
her tears that the meeting was accidental, J
that she had never been in the Garden]
City before they arrived on their honey
moon and had no interest In any man but j
himself. She says that he completed her j
humiliation by refusing to accept her ex
planation. He lost his temper and abused
her in' a shameful manner, calling her
names too indecent even for reproduction
in a divorce complaint. He kept It up
during their entire honeymoon, she says,
and has since their return to this city
been so cruel to her, even in the presence
of strangers, that she deems It for the
best interest of her health that she be
freed from the ties that unite her to him.
She says that it was only a few days ago
while they were preparing to -retire that
he showed her a loaded revolver and said
to her: "You see that. There are three
bullets here for you and two for me."
Elvlrs Giacopettl dates her marital un

Just two days after she became the wife
of Alberto Giacopettl. She says In a com

that on that date, while they were In San
Joee on their honeymoon, she left her
husband to go out and buy him some col
lars and shirts, leaving him. in their room3
at the hotel.
Fully twenty-five attorneys were re
tained by the plaintiffs and defendants
In the various actions. The principal ones
were D. M. Delmas, Walter Linforth, P.
F. Dunne and H. C. McPike.
The Wrights of San Joseâ My ra E.
Wright, her husband, W. H., and Frank
V. Wrlgfitâ who for the last two years
have occupied the attention of the Su
perior courts In three different counties â
San Francisco, San Joaquin' and Santa
Claraâ have settled all their differences
and have taken themselves and their
troubles out of the courts. Yesterday
more than forty dismissals of suits in
which the Wrights were plaintiffs and de
fendants 'sve re tiled in the of3ce of the
County Clerk here, and the announcement
was made that their various claims had
been adjudicated outside of the courts.
The announcement and the filing of the
dismissals is the closing act of one of.
the bitterest family rows that ever was
brought into the courts of this State.
It was early In 1901 that the three
Wrights first came into court. In that
year a suit was filed by Myra E. Wright
and her husband, W. H. Wright, against
Frank V. Wright to determine- the rights
of each in the holdings of the Jersey
Island Packing,- Company, in which the
three were interested. The defendant in
this action filed a counter suit, in which
he made charges equally as sensational as
those Incorporated in the complaint of
his brother and his wife. The actions in
volved the title to the possessions of the
Jersey Island Packing Company. Before
they were settled another action was
commenced, the second suit being due to
a tow over the actions of. Frank V.
Wright in connection with the Jersey
Island Dredging Company. This suit also
brought forth a bitter answer and counter
claim. Then came an action .over the
properties of the California A*sparagus
Company, in which the Wrights were In
terested. This was followed by a suit in
volving the assets and liabilities of the
Sah Jose Fruit Packing Company. The
last action brought was one to recover
posesslon of stock in the Bay and River
Dredging Company. The suit over the
holdings of the Jersey Island Packing
Company was bitterly fought, for it in
volved a large amount. It resulted in a
judgment for $S9,95S for Myra E. Wright.
The tntire property Involved is worth
5230,000.
After the jury had retired Attorneys

The real heroines of every day arq in our homes. Frequently, h<Trr-
ever, it is a mistaken and useless heroism.
Women seem to listen to every call of duty except the supremo
one that tells them to guard their health. How much harder the daily
tasks become when some derangement of the female organs make?
every movement painful and keeps tbe nervous system unstrung?
Irritability takes the place of happiness and amiability ; and weakness
and suffering takes the place of health and strength. As Ions as they
can 'dracr' themselves around, women continue to work and perform
their household duties. They have been led to believe that suffering
is necessaiy because they are women. What a mistake!
The use of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will banish
pain and restore happiness. Don't resort to strong stimulants or nar-
cotics when this great strengthening, healing remedy for women is
always within reach. ' . *
FREE MEDICAIi ADVICE TO TVOMEX.
If there is anything: in your case about which you "would 1Uir>
special ndvice, write freely to Mrs. Pinkham. No man will sec
your letter. She can surely help yon, for no person in America
has such :v wide experience in treating 1 female ills as she has hart.
She has helped hundreds of thousands of women back to health.
Her address is T^ynn, 3Ias>.. and her advice is free. You arc very
foolish if you do not accept her kind invitation.
For proof read the symptoms, suffering and cure
5 . recited in the following letters:
Â«' DEiR MB3. Pixkham : â I wish to express to you the great 'beneflt I
have derived from vour advice and the. use of Lydia E. Plnkham*s Vege-
table Compound. My trouble was female weakness in its worst form and.
* I was in a very bad condition. I could not perform my household duties, my
back ached. Iwas extremely nervous, and I could not eat or sleep, and tfce
bearing-down pains were terrible. My husband spent hundreds of dollar*
to get me well, and all the medicine that the doctors prescribed failed to do me
any good ; I resorted to an operation which the physician said was necessary
to restore me to health, but I suffered more after it than I did before ; I had
hemorrhages of the womb that nothing could seem to stop.
" I noticed one of your advertisements and wrote you for advice, I re-
ceived your reply and cnrefully followed all instructions. I immediately
began to get stronger, and in two weeks was about the house. I took eight
bottles of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and continued
following your advice, and to-dtyr I am a well woman. Your remedies and
help are a* Godsend to suffering women, and I cannot find words to thank
vou for what vou have done for me." â Mrs. 'Louie V. Xaylob, 1328 N. J.
Ave., N.W., Washington, D. C.
"Dear Mrs. Phtkham: â I write to tell you what Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound has done for me.
" I was suffering with falline of the womb and could hardly drag abo^t.
but after taking five bottles of iiydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound I was completely cured. I am now a well woman and able to do all
my work.
11 1 think your medicine one of the best remedies in the world."â Mm.
J. M. Lei, 141 Lyndal St., Newcastle, Pa,
"Dear Mrs. Pixkham : â Iiydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound has done a great deal for me. I suffered so much from falling of the
womb and all the troubles connected with it. I doctored for years with
doctors' and other remedies but received only temporary relief.
il I began taking your medicine, and had not taken it long before I rrnn
feeling better. My husband said that I should keep right on taking it as long
as it gave me relief from my suffering, as I could not expect to be cured bv
one or two bottles. I did so and am now able to be on my feet and -work
hard all day, and go to bed and rest at night. Thanks to your Vegetable Com-
pound I am certainly grateful for the relief it pave me. It is the mother's
great friend. I would not be without it in my house, for when I feel tired
or out of sort3 I take a few doses and feel all right.
" I would recommend your medicine to all tired mothers, and especially
to those suffering 1 as I was.'" â Mks. R. F. Chambers, Bonnet, Seb.

assassination, has been added to the list of Old World
monarchs who do not like their jobs. He has, how
ever, one distinct advantage- over the others. The

might be induced justly to reflect that the, candle is
not worth the game. There is some compensation in

The people of Panama indicate that they wish to
rebel against the Government of the United States
of Colombia because of the rejection of the canal
treaty, which meant so much of prosperity to the
people of the isthmus. It is not even within the
range of possibility that Uncle Sam would look upon
such a rebellion in any but the most complacent and
self-satisfied mood. We have some enemies that are
too annoying not to be noticed and too cheap to be
punished.

School Director Walsh made an Inves
tigation yesterday of a complaint that
Japanese children were being received
into the Pacific Heights schools to the
exclusion of white pupils. Walsh found
that there are only eleven Japanese pu
pils in the Pacific Heights School, dis
tributed in various classes, and three in
the Grant School. Walsh does not con
sider the complaint warranted by the
facts, but will pursue his inquiry in other
schools. He is of the opinion that more
Japanese pupils will be found In the
evening schools and the Polytechnic
School, which, however, are not over
crowded. The only remedy would be for
the Board of : Education to establish a
special school for Japanese as in the case
of the Chinese, but this will not be done
unless Japanese pupils are in sufficient
numbers to warrant the expense.
Few Japanese in Schools.

In most cases the resistance was strictly passive
and no attempt was made to interfere with the offi
cers in the sale of property seized for taxes, but at
times there were evidences of a feeling that may give
rise to trouble later on should the number of resisters
ever become large enough to encourage assort to an
active resistance in place of a passive one.
the movement in another issue the Gazette says: "In
large numbers of cases proceedings have not yet been
taken and several months must elapse before the full
extent of the resistance can be adequately measured."
A careful study of the summonses . shows that a
majority of the resisters who have thus far been
brought before the courts belong either to the Bap
tist. Congregational or Primitive Methodist churches,
but other free churches are well represented, notably
the Wesleyans. Some surprise has been felt at the
indifference to the issue of the Society of Friends, as
the members of that church were strenuous leaders in
the former battles against church rates. Members
WHEN the new education bill was under con
. sideration in Parliament a number of the
more earnest opponents of the feature of
the bill providing for the support of church schools
declared that if the Government undertook to collect
taxes for the support of such schools they would
refuse payment. The programme thus defined, be
came known as the policy of "passive resistance" and
was the chief object of political discussion in the
kingdom until Chamberlain's imperial tariff issue dis
tracted popular attention from the subject. The op
ponents of the measure, however, are standing by
their guns, and we learn from our London exchanges
that the passive resistance movement has already be
come formidable and is steadily extending through
out the country.
The Westminster Gazette deems the issue of suf
ficient importance to devote almost an entire page of
a recent edition to publishing a record of the sum
monses that have been issued to compel the payment
of taxes by the resisters. It appears that the first act
of resistance occurred on June 2, when four residents
of the parish of Wirksworth were summoned before
the local magistrates for refusing to pay the school
taxes. Warrants were issued against their property
and sixteen days later the sales took place without
disturbance. Since that time down to September 4,
the day of the publication of the Gazette, upward of
3000 summonses were issued and the number of dis
traint sales amounted to sixty.
PASSIVE RESISTANCE.

An Oakland man recently secured a divorce on the
score that his wife was an inveterate. and uniformly
unlucky gambler. The poor man evidently forgot,
?.nd the Judge did not choose to remind him, that in
his marriage he took a more desperate chance and
exhibited a more thoroughly inbred gambling spirit
in serious things than ever his spouse did in her
objectionable hazards.
Vogelsang reports also that four Chi
nese were arrested at San Pedro yester
day for having small abalone in their
possession and were fined J30 each. P.
Naba of San Rafael was caught with
one quail in his possession yesterday and
fined ?30.
State Game Warden W. F. Gray of
Montana wrote to Vogelsang in reference
to the matter, and the latter ascertained
that Pulitzer was to return to the North
west shortly after the conclusion of the
Grand Army encampment. The sports
man was caught 600 miles from the point
where the alleged offense was committed
and was compelled to make the long
journey back In the saddle,. The trial
will take place September 26.
Chief Deputy Vogelsang of the State
Fish Commission acknowledges that he
was a party to the recent apprehension
of Joseph Pulitzer, son of the proprietor
of the New York World, for violating the
game laws of Montana, The authorities
at Helena discovered that' the young mil
lionaire sportsman had indulged his taste
for shooting too far, but he was then
coming to San Francisco.

Consider Compressed Air machines.
The joint Supervisors Committee on ju
diciary and Streets reported back to the
board without recommendation the pro
posed ordinance restricting the operating
of compressed air cleaning machines on
the public streets. The ordinance Is de
signed to prohibit the operation of any
machine or engine on the streets for a
period of more than one hour at any
given point, provided, however, that thÂ«
provisions of the ordinance shall not af
fect machinery uspd in the prosecution
of public work. The committee was of
the opinion that the ordinance in Its pres
ent shape is invalid In that it is dis
criminatory. Cleve Dam. representing the
labor unions, who are advocating the or
dinance, said he was willing to take
chances on its validity. T*-e subject was

FOR a good many years it has been evident that
the white man would have to take up the bur
den of Morocco. The country is an important
one by reason of its relations to the Mediterranean
and the Atlantic and because of the rival interests of
France, Spain and Great Britain. When Lord Salis
bury made his famous speech some years ago about
"decadent nations" threatening the welfare of their
sound neighbors it was well understood that he in
cluded Morocco in the list. In fact the Morocco
problem has been quite a factor in European diplo
macy for a whole generation, and there have been
times when it threatened to become a cause of war.
Of late years the problem has been slowly solving
itself. After the war with this country Spain was
eliminated from the list of possible controllers of the
country. That war clearly demonstrated that Spain
can no longer be counted among the nations capable
of bearing the burden^ of empire. Morocco must
then pass to France W to Britain, for it seems to be
agreed that it cannot be much longer left in the
hands of the present incompetent possessors. For
the country as a whole the British have not had much
desire, but they have been looking with longing eyes
on a good port and harbor opposite Gibraltar. Some
of their naval authorities have declared the once for
midable rock fortress to be practically valueless in
modern war. It is true no power can take it, but
then no power except Spain wduld have any wish to
take it. Modern ships can steam through the straits
without coming within reach of its guns, and accord
ingly it no longer commands the passage as it <lid of
yore.
What is needed now by the British is not a strong
fort like Gibraltar, but a base of naval supplies and
a good safe harbor at the mouth of the Mediterranean.
Such a post can be obtained either in the island of
Minorca or on the coast of Morocco, but can hardly
be constructed at Gibraltar no matter how much be
the money expended. The facts have been frequently
brought out in discussions of the Morocco problem,
and it has been suggested that Great Britain should
give France a free hand in dealing with the country,
provided France agree to permit the British to take
possession of such a harbor as they wish.
No announcement has ever been made of any
agreement between the two powers on that or on any
other of their many points of antagonism, but it has
been more than once intimated that such an agree
ment is quite likely to be effected. It would seem
from the reports of the programme of French inva
sion of Morocco that some sort of understanding has
been reached. There are many ways in which France
could gain British consent to her occupation of
Morocco even without the surrender of a port as a
British naval base, for there are vexatious claims of
France in the Nile territory and in Newfoundland
whose settlement would be very comforting to a
British Ministry. It is therefore not improbable that
the French expedition into Morocco may be the-be
ginning of the end of that African kingdom' and that
within a few years it may be definitely annexed to the
empire of France.
THE MOROCCO PROBLEM.
There is thus ample evidence in the statistics of,
industry and of population to confirm the statement
of Mr. Northern that the race issue as it exists in
popular imagination is largely a bugaboo. With the
increase of wealth in the South there will corns an in
crease of schools and an increase of effectiveness in
the rural constabulary, and then lynch law will be as
rare in that as in any other section of the Union.
/^ INCE so much attention has been given to the
recent speech of John Temple Graves of
Georgia in defense of lynch law it is but fair to
note that he docs not in any way represent the domi
nant sentiment of the white people of Georgia, nor
did he accurately present the relations of whites and
blacks to one another in that State. His assertion
that the two races cannot develop a good advantage
while in contact with one another and his plea for a
programme of separation by a removal of the negroes <
from the South have been promptly refuted and re
pudiated by such rewspapers as the Atlanta Constitu
tion and by some of the most eminent men in the
State.
The most elaborate reply that has been made to
Graves comes frdm W. J. Northern, a former Gov
ernor of Georgia and one of the most careful students
of the race problem. In an extended discussion of
the subject, published in a recent issue of the Consti
tution, Mr. Northern begins by furnishing proof that
.i majority of the whites of Georgia do not believe in
lynch law as a remedy for any crime whatever. He
says: "During my administration I had occasion to
make a very thorough' official investigation that fully
satisfied me that the people of this State as a body are
n the fullest sympathy with the administration of the
law and that they are ready to uphold it at any and
all hazard whatever the nature of the crime demand
ing punishment."
Referring to the fact that lynchings have occurred
:n Georgia with considerable frequency he says:
"There have been in this State and in every other
State considerable violations of the criminal code, but
that does not indicate that the people are not pro
nounced against such iniquities." He added that the
undue prominence given in the press and in public
discussions to lynching cases leads to a. misconception
as to their frequency and that such outrages are by no
means so common as uninformed people believe.
Passing to a general consideration of the relations
of the two races Mr. Northern says they are now less
antagonistic and more co-operative than at any for
mer period since the war. He closed by saying:
'"We are now putting all the idle negroes to work and
the better negroes are helping to this end. Vice and
crime have greatly decreased ar/.ong them and we
are practically free from trouble. Let us stop the
continued abuse of the negro and rather help him to
be useful to himself and to the community. Com
mend him freely and generously and publicly, if you
will, when he docs well, and punish him severely in
the courts when he is vicious, and let that be the end
of it. We have no occasion for a constant crying out.
We have peace and abundant prosperity. Just let us
say so, publish the crimes of the people if it is best,
but let us be sure they have been committed before
we sav so."
Statements of that kind coming from men of known
influence in the South are far more cheerful reading
than the lurid rhetoric of men like Graves, who have
liardJy any other desire than that of making a repu
tation as lecturers. The problem of the races in the
South it unquestionably a difficult one, but the diffi
culties are being steadily overcome by the silent
workers who are going bravely about their work
â¢vrhile the orators are talking. The prosperity of the
South, which is so abundantly evident of late
years, is itself a proof that the two races are effect
ively co-operating in all departments of industry.
Moreover the latest census statistics show that for
the first time in many decades the population of the
South increased between 1890 and 1900 ih about the
fame percentage as that of "the North. That .fact
shows that the Southern people are not migrating to
the North and West in anything like the numbers of
former years. If the relations of the races were any
thing like 60 bad aj Graves and others like him de
clare we should have had a larger and not a dimin
ished exodus of Southern people from their homes.

PERSONAL MENTION.
The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that Amelia Harrington was not entitled
to any portion of the estate of John P.
Harrington. The evidence showed that
deceased and the plaintiff married
in Michigan, but that a separation took
place a few months thereafter. Mrs. Har
rington alleges that she thought that her
husband was dead and subsequently mar
ried James Carley.
Her contention was that the last mar
riage was void and that as the widow of
John Harrington she was entitled to a
homestead. The Supreme Court holds
that her second marriage was "voidable,"
but not void. Mrs. Harrington, or Mrs.
Carley, then, can get nothing from the
estate in auestlon.
The court also declared yesterday that
Sotoyome Tribe. I. O. R. M.. must i>.iyÂ»
a certain amount In sick benefits to Oith
edine Schou. The plaintiff's husband waa
a member of the order. He became in
sane and died.
She attempted to secure the benefit.-.,
which were refused on the ground that
Schou's illness waa caused by overindul
gence in liquor. The rules of the order
provide that no benefits are to be paid
in such cases. It was not proved that
Schou's Illness was caused by liquor ami
the court says that the benefits must bo
paid. ; . ' â¢

The board of officers of the First Regi
ment. L. C. C. announce a full-dress hop
on Thursday evening, September 24, at
Native Sons' Hall.
It is announced by telegraphic report
that Miss Ruth Bryan, daughter of Wil
liam Jennings Bryan, is engaged to Wil
liam Homer Leavltt, the artist who
painted her father's picture. Now, that
is really a very- pretty story. Artists are
dangerous things to have about, where
susceptible young girls linger â especially
when they wield an Inspired brush, 4 ds
did this young Lochinvar. Papa Bryan
has not yet substantiated the story of
the betrothal, but It Is safe to conjecture
what the spirited young miss will do if
worst comes to worst.
Not quite in keeping with the original
plan was Dr. and Mrs. Joseph Marshall
Flint's going away. Instead of starting
for the sylvan shades of Wyntoon after
their wedding, they quietly slipped over
to this city and went straight to their
new home on Green street, near Scott.
The following interesting programme
was rendered during the reception hours:
Jewel song from "Faust," Miss Helen
Heath; monologue, Miss Lillian Qulnn;
vocal solo, . Miss Vivian Bailey; vocal
solo. Miss Golden; piano solo ("Noc
turne," by Leybach). Miss Connolly.
After the rendition of these numbers a
dainty supper was served in Elks' Hall.
On Wednesday night the members of
the George H. Thomas Circle 'No. 32, La
dies of the G. A. R., presided over by
Mrs. Mary Merrill Miller, held an in
formal reception at Utopia Hall in honor
of Mrs. Belinda S. Bailey.
'Â¦ The guest of .honor has been recently
promoted to tho national presidency of
the Ladles of the G. A. R., and deep in
terest was manifested at this function,
the first held in her honor by her own
circle. -

The following guests enjoyed the hos
pitality of Mr. Harrison: Mis3 Margaret
Anglin, Mrs. G. Livingstone Lansing,
Mrs. Frank Grace, Mrs. Josephine de
Greayer, Miss Frances Jollffe, Miss Vir
ginia Joliffe, Miss Helen do Young, Miss

A. Joullln and A. Dalton Harrison.
The decorations were strikingly attrac
tive, an electric fountain in the center of
the table scintillating brilliantly. Water
lilies and La France roses Jent their
beauty and fragrance to the festal board,
and a mass of maplo leaves, with their
deep green, accentuated the delicacy of
the blossoms.
Amadee Jouillin had laid his skillful
brush upon the guest cards with very
happy results, and during the evening
presented the guests of honor with a se
rious bit of his skillâ a work In oils.
A charming supper was given on Thurs
day night in the red room of the Bo
hemian Club' by William Greer Harrison,
complimentary to .Miss Margaret Anglin
and Henry Miller. Seldom has a func
tion been* held beneath this rooftree ot
good fellowship that was more In keeping
with the congenial atmosphere identified
with these hospitable walls.
The food committee will also take up a
proposed modification of the standards
for ketchup^ and baking powders as a re
sult of so*hie samples being found deficient
In certain requirements.
Green believes that the Increase In but
ter fats will be' of Interest to the con
sumer and the decrease in solids, not fat,
will be of interest toÂ«the seller of milk.
Green is not as yet prepared to make any
recommendation regarding the specific
gravity to be reaulred and does not ex
press any pronounced opinion as to
whether a change In that connection is
advisable. He says that very few ar
rests " are made for deficiency In total
Bolids In milk.
Green has made a number of analyses
recently as a result of milk raids by food
inspectors and states that the milk has
been found In the majority of cases to be
pure. No arrests were made in the last
raid, when fourteen samples were taken
for chemical examination. None of the
samples examined contained any forma
line. .
Professor Green, after exhaustive an
alyses of milk samples, covering a period
of many years, is prepared to recommend
that the present requirement of 3.2 per
cent for butter fats be increased to 3.4
per cent and on the other hand that the
existing exaction of 8.8 per cent for solids
not fats be reduced to 8.07 per cent, and
the food committee. It is understood, is
favorable to Green's recommendation.
This will change the present specifica
tion of 12 per cent for total solids to 11.47.
which Professor <2reen believes should
rule, 'owing to the peculiar conditions
existing In the milk industry of this city.
He points to the fact that owing to the
lengthened dry season pecullaryto this
coast it is a hardship to exact such a
high percentage in solids not fat in milk.
The Board of Health has under con
sideration a proposed change In the pres
ent milk standard and In all likelihood a
revision of the same will be put in effect
at no distant date. The matter has been
referred to the food committee of the
board, consisting of Drs. Lewltt and
Baum, who are In consultation with City
Chemist Green regarding the contem
plated modification.
Kxpert Cyril Williams ascertained yps
terday that an error has been made in
calculating the SO per cent Increase mado
by the State Board of Equalization on
San Francisco's total assessment of $427,
&11.64S. According to the Pdlittcal CodÂ«Â«.
there is exempt from any raise which
may be made by the board named all
moneys, solvent credits, mortgages, deeds
of trust, contracts and other obligations
by which a debt is secured, it beins the
law that such assessments have a stable
value.
Williams has figured tr.at the raise of
30 per cent should be calculated on the
total roll less moneys, solvent credits,
etc., which would be as follows:
Real estate . . .' '^J'^'?^
Improvements 9S.Â»S*.1W)

Money, no! vent credits, etc., ex- rr
empt from ratse ,. 33..^H).0M>
Grand total assessed valuation $543,833.32*
Auditor Baehr is In receipt of a circular
from the State Board of Equalization giv
ing formal notification of the raise in the
assessment roll of this city, which con
tains the following Instructions:
In all cases -where the property Is subject to
a mortgage or trust deed the percentage of
increase must flrÂ»t be added to the. asanwrnent
of the property affected and the deduction
made from the increased aysesment, and the
change must correspondingly be made In thiÂ«
total vaiue column, otherwise there will be a
less amount of taxes raised than is necessary
for State purposes. To illustrate, if a man is
assessed for JtOOO on a tract of land subject
to a mortgage of $.VX> the "'> per cent In
crease would apply to the total valuation of
$1000 on the theory that the property has been
undervalued, so that the owner would pay
taxes on JGOO not covered by mortgage, plus
$20o raise, or $S0O. the mortgage of $500, of
course, to be assessed to the mortgagee.
The popular demand that the proposed issue of
these bonds, made a lien on the city, be voted down
and that another proposition be submitted making
them a lien on the road alone is not in opposition to
public ownership at all, but is rather in favor of it by,
forcing it into such strict business lines as will con
tribute to its success and lessen the chances for its
failure. If the Examiner can conjure any reasons
why this should not be done let it conjure and print
the result of its divinations in large black-faced type
on :ts editorial page, that the taxpayers may know
what it thinks it thinks about the matter. If
William Randolph Hearst will not buy the bonds
when based on the road only, why not?
As far as The Call's position is concerned it is un
affected by any speculation as to whether the road
will be operated by the city at a profit or a loss. We
merely insist that the bonds to acquire it be a lien
upon the road only and not upon the city. If the
Examiner have any objections to that it will please
state them and come down out of the air and into
Geary street. It is now quoting Mr. Horace Platt's
figures of the private operation of the road to show
that it will pay the city a profit. Mr. Platt's figures
are made upon what the road is doing and may do
under private ownership. They are positively no
proof that it will do better or worse under public
ownership.
We insist that the history of public ownership in
this country proves by analogy that the road will do
worse under public ownership, but that has nothing
to do with the demand of the taxpayers that the
bong's shall be based on the road and not be a lien
on the city. In Massachusetts eighteen cities were
lighted by gas and electricity by private companies.
Under the law of that State when public ownership
is undertaken all private property in the same line
that might compete has to be taken over, as in
England, so that public ownership shall have no pri
vate competitor. In the eighteen cities in question
the private companies were all making a profit. The
same cities have now had several years' experience in
public ownership, with the result that the cost of light
is double what the private companies charged, and
yet there is a heavy annual deficit that has to be met
by general taxation.
We are only holding aloft the lamp of experience.
San Francisco may be an exception in public owner
ship and may net a profit where other cities have
netted a loss. No man can say whether this will or
will not be the result of the experiment here. The
real opponents of public ownership are those who,
like the Examiner, insist upon an unbusinesslike be
ginning by wanting to burden the whole city with a
debt which the Geary-street road should bear alone.
The city proposes to go into the business of run
ning a street railroad and to do it just as a private
corporation would, by issuing bonds. The Exam
iner seems to think that it thinks the city will not
own the road unless these bonds are a lien upon the
city and not upon the road. By parity of reasoning
the private corporation would not own its property if
the bonds for it were based upon it alone. This is
rank nonsense from any business point of view. 1/
Mr. William Randolph Hearst is willing to buy the
bonds issued as a lien on the city, why is he not will
ing to buy them issued as a lien on the road alone?
He says: "If experience should prove that the city
cannot run the road at a profit there will not be much
lost" if the bonds are a lien on the city. We reply
that if the bonds are a lien on the road alone there
will be nothing lost if, as he says, private parties will
then be willing to lease it at a high price, for the
rent of the property must then pay the bonds and
interest and the taxpayers will lose nothing. .
THE Examiner, in the body of a page displayed
in large type, returns to a discussion of the
Geary-street Railroad bonds, in which it says:
"The opponents of the acquisition of the road make
the objection that it will cost the city more to run it
than the road will bring in."

It will be remembered that when the tariff question
was precipitated by Mr. Chamberlain some of the op

but there can be no doubt that the Ministers were
quite glad to get away from the denominational con
troversy which was threatened. Even as it is, how

In describing the manner in which the distraint
sales are received by the public the Gazette says:
;\ "There was some feeling displayed at a sale of the
goods of Passive Resisters at Colchester yesterday,
the Rev. T. Batty, a Baptist minister, and the Rev.
Pierrepont Edwards, locally, known as 'the fighting
parson,' entering into discussion in the auction room,
but being stopped by the auctioneer, who said he did
his work during the week and he hoped they did
theirs on Sundays. At Long Eaton the goods of
twenty-three Passive Resisters were sold amid demon
strations of hostility to the auctioneer. A boy was
arrested for throwing a bag of flour. Six distress
warrants were issued at Loughborough, in Leicester
shire, while at Brighton the magistrates made orders
in nearly one hundred cases. There was much
demonstration in the court, the magistrates after one
â¢outburst leaving the bench and ordering the room
to be cleared. Some people were put out, but others
clung to their seats and would not move. The chief
constable appealed to all to leave quietly, but realiz
ing the ugly aspect of things^ he consented to act as
mediator and ask the magistrates to proceed on the
understanding that there was no further disturbance.
Thus the situation was saved."

AMERICAN SHIP SUSQUEHANNA, THAT ARRIVED THURSDAY NIGHT 124 DAYS FROM BALTIMORE, AFTER
EXPERIENCING AN EXCEPTIONALLY ROUGH VOYAGE. THE BOATSWAIN DIED OF INJURIES RE
CEIVED DURING A STORM, AND ANOTHER SAILOR NARROWLY ESCAPED DEATH.
Captain Bcrmingham stated in his opin
ion that this was the first case of the kind
that had come to hi? notice; that the
next offender would be visited with the
full penalty of the law, and that the
local inspectors had no discretion except
to impose the full penalty, which was
revocation of the license.
The inspectors found that Captain Ja
cobs had neglected to enter in his log
book any record of boat or fire drills and
that in fact none of such drills had been
had for several weeks during the recent
voyage of the steamer.
The sentence imposed by I'nited States
I^ocal Inspectors Captains Bolles and
Bulger upon Captain Jacob D. Jacobs of
the steamship San Pfdro, whereby they
revoked his license, which had yet four
years to run, was modified yesterday by
Supervising Inspector Captain John Bcr
mingham by changing the sentence of
four years to fourteen days.

matter of the ubel of the Ames Mercan

The Chinese Bureau isÂ« occupying a
strategic point in the rear of the prose
cution and is engaged in praying that
the Marshal's oilier and the pecret ser
vice men may apprehend the fugitives.
The word has been passed ail along the
official line: "Tell nothing to the pub
lic." and the injunction is being literally
obeyed. Should the officers fail to make
any further arrests Gamble will be
obliged to stand trial alone or fb plead
guilty alone, without the extenuating cir
cumstances in his favor of having turned
over his confederates to the hand of jus
tice.
Although vigorous search has been
made tince Monday for Tom Toon and
Wong Tin, Gambles confederates in the
substitution game, the officers have
failed to find them, and it is believed that
they escaped from the city and went
into hiding in some town in the interior
as soon as they learned of the captura
of the six substitutes on Friday of last
week.
Former (Deputy I'nited States Marshal
William P. Gamble did not put in an ap
pearance at the office yesterday, all ne
cessity for hi? appearance having been
obviated by the publication of his con
fession in The Call last Wednesday
morning. Marshal Shine was asked
whether he had vuspended Gamble from
liuty. but he refused either to affirm or
deny the fact. There is no doubt, how
ever, that Gamble has severed his con
nection with the office.
H was not until a quarter of 5 o'clock
yesterday afternoon that United States
District Attorney AVood worth left his ot
lice after a day of very hard work with
I'nited States Marshal Shine and United
States Secret Service Apents \V. J. Burns
and Harry Moilitt. There was evidently
something important on foot, but the
mouths of all jiartlos were sealed. Short
ly before noon the junta called upon
I'nited Stales Court Commissioner Hea
cock with a signed complaint upon which
Judge Heacock issued a warrant of ar
rest. Two cuDies of the warrant were
made, one bting placed in the hands ol

As a rule the tournament games are
r'.ayed Saturday afternoons. No matches
are played on Sunday. l\zi\y of the bowl
t-rs who live near the park get out for a
little practice after working hours.
The following matches will be played in
ihe second round.
Those who know are of the opinion that
Thomas McNaught and John McLaren
will come tocether in the final round.
With Mr. Lawson out of It. the honors
should fall to one of these two men.
The second round of thÂ© Scottish bowl-
Ing tournament will commence this after
ncon on Golden Gate Park rinks. The
round closes October 3, by which time all
of the matches must be played. The com
petition of the flrEt round last Saturday
leaves thirty-two out of the original six
ty-four players entered to compete for
final honors. In the opening round there
was but one default and three byes, twen
ty-eight of the matches being actually
played.
~Z. C. Lawson. the winner of the last
tournament and considered by many the
best bowler in the club, was beaten in
the first round by a one-sided score.
Having won the previous tournament,
Mr. Lawson wished to stay out of this
one and give another man a chance to
win. He was finally persuaded to play,
Â»>ut did not exert himself and was beaten
by a man considered not nearly so clever
a* himself.

This Afternoon on Golden Gate

SCOTTISH BOWLZBS BEADY

Ike Walters. Eddie Householder and Bill
Gannon are still "bush leaguing" down In
the Santa Barbara district. This is quite
a come-down to men who rrere' rated as
stars a few short months ago.
There Is but one man now on the pitch
ing staff who is competent to win games,
and that is Mr. Whalen. The others do
not seem to have the goods that baffle
the opposing batsmen, and consequently
no difficulty is experienced in beating San
Francisco when the club goes up against
any team that Is in condition to play ball.
The chase for the pennant is about set
tled. Los Angeles has the flag copped,
artd in a walk. Interest* Is now centered
in the/race for last place and the race' for
second honors^ } At present the home .team
is secondâ a badUsecond, to be sure, but
still it holds the position. How long^it
will be there remains to be seen.
It seems Oakland's sudden burst of
speed will be stopped by. the Los Angeles
aggregation. The southern club-wlelders
are in the game at all times, and if they
do not 4 win one week they make up for
lost time the next. If Oakland can possi
bly get away with a majority of - the
games of the present .meeting. Peter and
his crowd will be rated as dangerous
enemies to the other clubs of the league.
If Mike Fisher can make Phil Knell and
Youngey Johnson pitch ball he may-have
a chance to do something. . It would be
funny, indeed, if the twtrold men got. in
and pitched Mike's team Into second
place. Had Fisher a formidable pitching
staff his team might be a beadllner, -but
those youngsters are not there when Uiey
are needed. V. ;v v
Any old kind of a ball team that plays
ball at all could easily get in and rout the
home bunch In their present condition.
Such a patched up ball nine does not look
good in a big city like San Francisco, and
consequently the home talent does not
draw the crowds it would with any kind
of a half decent line-up.
There is hardly a sound man in Harris'
Une-up at the present time. It is a pitiful
sight to see Zearfoss, Pabst and Iberg
hobble about the field when they begin to
play ball; lt.is just about the limit.
leaguers a run for second money.
Mike Fisher's team has been on the slide
so long that it is just about due to get
busy and come through with a little
sprint. If Fisher's tossers begin on San
Francisco they may keep up the spurt,
and then perhaps make a strong showing
against the northern clubs.
THE Senators are beginning to come
strongly now, and it "seems they
may give Uncle Henry and his bush
Only three teams are In the third class.
It is expected Miss Vera Beyfuss and Miss
Hazel Naylor, the holders, will again
prove victorious.
There will be no tournaments on the
California Club courts for some time.
The annual election Of officers will be held
next Saturday. There will be no radical
changes.
The women of the club will meet to-day
on the public courts. Play will be In
doubles and will be confined to the second
and third classes. In the second class all
the six teams entered are closely
matched. Miss Allberger and Miss K.
Lindstrom are favorites, but will have to
play their best to win.
The Baker brothers of Oakland will
play from scratch and with the hanSlcaps
allowed stand a good chance of winning.
They play a steady, safe game and the
handicaps should not bother them. Routh
and Dunlap, the other scratch players,
are In the opposite half and the- chances
are they will meet the Baker brothers In
the finals.
Some of the teams on the "2-6" mark
will prove dangerous opponents.. Foley
and Lewis, Janes and Russell and the
Hotchkiss - brothers all have a chance.
The Long brothers, wKh odds of "15 1-6,"
will be hard to beat.
Homer and Marlus Hotchkiss were In
the lead with two victories to their credit.
The former has left town and his place will
be taken by his brother, Miller. The only
teams which have won the cups and are
playing are Routh and Dunlap and Whit
ney and Brady. Smith and Allen and
Church and McKay, one-time winners,
will not compete in future.
The tournament to-morrow will be a
handicap doubles for the silver loving cups,
which must' be won three times. Many
new teams are In the tournament and It
Is expected two new names will be in

FOOTBALL PLAYERS OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY WHO ARE EX
PECTED TO PLAY A PROMINENT PART IN THE SEASON'S GRID
IRON CONTESTS, WHICH COMMENCE TO-DAY WITH A MATCH
WITH THE RELIANCE CLUB ELEVEN.
Bo"ynton and Sterns are rivals for full
back, with the chances leaning toward
Boynton. Boynton was full back and cap
tain of last year's freshmen team. By
some of the critics he is considered a
better player in that difficult position
than even Whipple was last year.
More finally got Into the gams again
Wednesday after flirting around for a
week or so making up his mind whether
he would play or not. He has played
three years with the varsity and knows
the game thoroughly. Belknap, -who has
played with Dartmouth and last gear's
alumni team, and Geary, who was a var
sity substitute and captain of the second
eleven lastVear, are More's opponents.
It Is hard to tell Just how the fresh
man team will line up. There are eighty
freshmen on the field every day, all de
termined to win a place on the. team by
exhibiting an immense amount of dash
and fight so that It Is no easy Job to
pick out a team.
Barton is the freshman most likely to
play center. He is a big. fellow, weigh
ing eomethlnu like 230 pounds and with
considerable speed notwithstanding the
avoirdupois. Allen will probably play
left guard. His weight Is 205 pounds.
Jackson, another big man, will play left
guard. The candidates with the best
chances of making: the team are: Cen
ter â Barton, Haley; guardsâ Allen, Allison,
Killian. Jackson; tackles â Eg-gers, Swee
ney, Clark ( Lachman; ei.dsâ CamanettI,
Gillis, Kleinschmldt, Stevens, Mlllard;
half-backsâ Tweedle, Kern, Taylor, Crow;
fullbacks â Gabriel, Booth, Schaufele;
quarter-backsâ Sell, j Hanna.
The first freshman game will be played
to-morrow, the Oakland High School
team lining up against Berkeley.
Stroud. center; Overall, right guard;
Stow, left guard, and Howard, left tackle,
are men whose positions are already as
sured. They have had the experience that
comes from Intercollegiate playing and
besides are bis men and clever. Howard
was a varsity substitute last year. He
went into the intercollegiate game after
Albertson had been Injured early In the
play.
It is a "toss up" between Heltmuller
and Forse for right tackle. Heitmuller.
however, was so confident that he would
get the place that he did not begin prac
ticing until Wednesday of this week.
Forse is a big man with a good head and
would have played last year had he been
eligible.
Hudson is a candidate for his. old posi
tion of rieht end, but as he has been ill,
for a week with malarial fever he may'
be prevented from playing altogether. In
his olace the coaches have been trying
various men of the second eleven.
The left end station will probably go
to Demeritt. though he has a sturdy op
ponent In "Craig, who is playing against
him on the second eleven. Demeritt was
a substitute last year.
Jack Whipple and Graves will fight it
out for the honor of playing right half.
Whipple played full back last year on the
varsity. This year he is making a try
for right half. Graves played for a time
last year, but got out of the game early
in tha season when other matters en
gaped his attention.
Three men â Muther > Risley and Snedi
erarâare out for left' half. Muther and
RHsley were varsity substitutes last year
and had the advantage of playing in
the preliminary games. Snedlgar Is play
ing a good, stiff game now on the second
eleven.
C. E. Maud, formerly of the Riverside
Polo and Golf Club and holder of the
amateur championship of the Pacific
Coast Golf Association, Intends to make
his home in Northern California. He will
join the San Francisco Golf Club. As
Mr. Maud Is generally regarded as the
strongest amateur In the West, his com
ing will bÂ« a welcome addition to the
strength of the Presidio team.
W. E. Falrlie, the brother of Frank
Falrlle, the Scotch amateur. Is a fine
golfer also. Recently on the North Ber
wick links he made a score of 71, which
Is a brilliant one. At the top of his game
he Is eaual to the best amateur or pro
fessional Kolfers. He is the inventor of
a patent Iron club with which It is im
possible to send a ball off at a tangent
through striking It with the "hose," or
neck, as the blade is set on In front.
These irons are extremely useful when
a ball is In a bad lie, but hardly a bad
enough one to call for the niblick.
A British newspaper Is offering $1000
for competition among professional golf
ers. Only members of the Professional
Golfers' Association are to be permitted
to take part and the competitors are lim
ited to thirty-two. .Preliminary qualify
ing rounds over thlrty-slx holes will de
termine the selection of the players. The
final tournament Is to be held on Octo
ber 13 and succeeding days at Sunning
dale, under match rules, over eighteen

the first day's play will receive prizes as
follows: Winner, $300; second, $150; third
and fourth, $75 each; next four, $50 each.
the second eight trophy of the San
Rafael Golf Club, between W. J. Casey
and Douglas Hardy. The winner will
hold the trophy until the next competition
for it take? place.
The golfers of the San Francisco Club
are engaged In another before-breakfast
handicap tournament, the five matches In
which must be played before 9 o'clock in
the morninK. The entry list closes to
morrow, and the five rounds of nine holes
each, of which the tournament consists,
must be completed before October 10. The
handicaps will be allotted by Robert
Johnstone, the professional of the San
Francisco Golf Club, who is thoroughly
familiar with the strength of the players.
A similar handicap of ten rounds was
completed recently. Dr. and Mrs. J. R.
Clark tying for the two prizes with net
scores of 418 each. L. B. Edwards was
third, with a net score of 419. In the
coming tournament, which Is a handicap
against "bogey," there will be a prize
for the winner.

One week from to-day the California
Coursing Futurity will be run at Union
Parjc. This is the richest event of the
year for young greyhounds. It bears an
unusually open look, r.o greyhound stand-
Ing out above his fellows.
T. J. Cronln's Fair Tralee, which was
thought to have the Futurity at his mer
cy,'will hardly be able to start owing to
an Injured foot. He had the speed over
everything In thÂ«? stake, being particular
ly fast out of slips. If he does pot atart
in the Futurity Mr. Cronln offers to
match blm against the winner for JTjCO a

be used in the advancement of coursing
on the Pacific Coast. The fleetest grey
hounds in America are owned in Califor
nia and the best twenty-four of these
were placed at the disposal of the mem
bers of the committee.
Many out of town coursing men will
make a pilgrimage to this city to witness
the running of the stake. The Sacramento

LAST ROUND
Last Sunday, the wind being light in thi
upper bay. many of the yachts cruised In
the channel. Among them were the flag
ship Thetis of the San Francisco Yacht
Club, the sloops Challenger and Annie
and the yawl Wave. Th? sloops Queen.
Ariel, Curlew and Halcyon, with the yawl
Royal, sailed to Paradise Covel The
schooners Chispa and White Wings went
out last Saturday afternoon, returning on
Sunday. The yawl Gypzie, the sloops
JessiwE and other boats of the Califor
nia fleÂ«;t were also cruising In the channel
on Sunday.
Percy Bun of the yawl Kittiwake, to
which the regatta committee of the Pa
cific Inter-club Yacht Association award
ed the second flag in the 20-fooJ special
race sailed on Admission day. has notified
a member of the committee that she
fouled one of the stakeboats anchored at
the starting line off Powell-street wharf.
This disqualifies the yawl and gives the
second flag to the Â»loop Mistral of the
San Francisco Yacht^Club.
The handicap regatta cf the California
Yacht Club for the cup presented by ex-
Vlce Commodore Robert Vincent, owner
of the yawl lola, will not take place to
morrow, as set down on the schedule, but
on Sunday, the 27th.
This afternoon the yachts of the Corin
thian fleet will leave TIburon Cove and
will make Vallejo to-night. As It Is high
water at San Francisco harbor entrance
at 10:14 to-night, the tide serves favorably
for a run up to Mare Island. To-morrow
the fleet will sail back to Its moorings at
Tiburon.
Next week the yacht owners will be
busy preparing their craft for the annual
regatta of the San Francisco Club, wnich
will take place on Sunday, the 27th inst..

be under the management of the regatta
committee, which consists of George E.
Smith, chairman, J. B. Levensaler and W.
L. Spencer. The start will be off Powell

marks. . ' / â
To-morrow morning the sloop Ariel,
chartered by the Haley In others, will eall
from Sausalito, bringing up to the cove
non-owners and yachtsmen who are not
able to make the trip this evening. When
all the yachtsmen and their guests arc
assembled to-morrow morning a big cook
ing range will be constructed on shore
from the bricks abounding in that region
and clam ' chowder, with other good
things, will be prepared under the able
supervision of "Jim" Logan, the chowder
chef of the San Francisco Yacht Club.
After a suitable interval the nautical
games and sports will begin. The first
event will be a swimming race for a suit
ably engraved cup and a rowing race In
yachts' yawls for a similar trophy.
There will be a race In which the con
testants. In a skiff, paddle with their
hands to a yacht, at the crosstrees of
which a prize will be hung. The man

will be a sack race, the winner receiving
a silver key ring, and a foot race for a
matchbox; also a three-legged race and
a partnership race. In the last event one
partner carries the other for half the

does not seem to be any great difference
between this year's team and last. The
list Is filled with the names of men who
made the varsity last year and with those
who nearly did so. A number of really

sity of California this week gave
One of the most promising: men in tHe
freshman equad is bis "Jim" Weller, who
Â« ntcred college last Christmas, and easily
won a place on the varsity track team
in the spring. He is eligible for the
freshman eleven and is a candidate for
the position of tackle. His speed and
weight make him a. possibility for the
vacancy on the varsity. In Goudy, Blood,
WDhelm, Chalmers, Minturn, Dole and
Stephenson the entering class have a
likely bunch of fast men from which to
choose a back field trio. Stott. Stagner.
Xing and Cole, candidates for quarterback
on the '07 team, will furnish an abundance
of material from which to select a man
for that position.
To-morrow's game with Reliance will
afford the lirst chance of judging of the
possibilities of the '03 varsity. The team
will bo almost a. new organization, prob
ably not more than 'five cf last year's

Mike Fisher, who Is ever original, show
ed the fans at Recreation Park yester
day that he is still young and in the
running. 'Twas tipped about the grounds
before the game - that the Sacramento
magnate would go Patrolman Harry
Hook a heat of fifty yards for a purse.
When the fourth round had been played
Fisher and Hook appeared near the Sac
ramento bench with their coats off and
each adorned with a baseball cap. They
lined up back of first base and as soon
as the rules of the footrace srarno were
explained to them the signal was given
and they were off.
A wild yell went up from the multitude
as the pair began to wabble away from
the mark and the earth began to shake.
On they came. Fisher leading by several
lengths, but the copper going gamely and
looking for a chance to sprint ahead.
Mike would have walked away with the
purse only his curiosity got the better
of him. As he'neared the home stretch
he turned around to see if Hook was com
ing. Hook was coming and so fast that
he caught the- magnate Just as he reached
the finishing line. The race was declared
a dead heat.

AS the banks of fog were beginning
to descend gently on the ball field
at Recreation Park yesterday, and
Umpire Jim McDonald was wait
ing to call it all off. the native talent
suddenly came through with a rally. It
did not last Ions, but when it was all
over the Senators were routed and all
the glory was Uncle's. Score. 5 to 4.
The Senators managed to cop out the
lead early in the flght and threatened to
hold It for a while. The home team did
not seem risht and could not stop tho
onward march of the Senatorial gang.
Iberg was pitching great ball for a sick
man. but somehow the Senators managed
to amass four runs.
Every one seemed to have conceded the
game to the Senators and no one held
out any hope for a rally till it came un
expectedly.
In thÂ« eighth, with the score 4 to 2
against them, the home sluggers took a
brace. A hit by Meany and two bases
on balls filled the bags. Then Pabst flew
to left field and Meany beat the throw
to the plate. Krus went out, and It did
not look good.
Delmas responded with a drive that
went through Casey and both Irwln and
Zearfoss registered, making the score 5
to 4 in favor of Uncle Henry. The score:

blood coursina through his veins. After
a pretty four-round exhibition he was
awarded the palm of victory over Bob

Cairns took the lead in the first round
and seemed to puzzle Grey with his
swings and Jolts. The latter came up
fresh in the second- and from that time
on he had no difficulty in showing Cairns
up. He blocked every punch which the
Olympic Club boy shot at him and met
his opponent with an ever ready left jolt.

Ex-Mayor R. W. Snow was attacked
and severely beaten last night in front of
his residence, at 914 Eighth street, by
Adolph Goldman, who conducts a crock
cry store at 307 Washington street.
Snow's face and head were severely
bruised and scratched in the encounter.
Goldman says Snow owes, him money.
The ex-Mayor thinks his assailant is la
boring under hallucinations.
The ex-Mayor said:
Goldman has been hounding me ever since I
was Mayor. I once did him a favor and he has
since been trying to strike up a friendship, and
his conduct is very offensive to me. When
I refuse to associate with him he becomes
angry and threatens my life and that of my
Â»Hf " I nave been living Jn constant fear
of him for more than a year. Â«
When I went to Chicago he followed me and
remain'd there a week, dogging my stepw.
Klnce my return to California he has still
hounded me. I^st January, while I was living
in San Francisco, I was compelled to seek po
lice protection. Chief Wlttman detailed a
bodyguard to protect me. To evade this insane
pursuer I have constantly changed my place
or residence. On three different occasions I
have taken pistols away from Goldman and
twice I have re'ieved him of razors. I have
been at a loss to know how to rid myselr of
his constant annoyance.
Last night I returned from an outing on the
American River. While there Goldman vis
lted . me three times, repeating his threats. Last
night as I stepped, from tho train he was
iL. 8tatIon to meet me. - He insisted on
walking with me and as we reached my home
at T L Eighth street he BUddenly assaulted me.
I have never been associated with Goldman
In business and I do not owe him any money,
unless he considers that I am Indebted to him
because In his excessive friendliness he has
spent his money in taking me to theaters and
dinners.
I may have the man arrested for insanity. I
can at least have him arrested for disturbing
my peace.

ALAMEDA. Sept. 18.â Lives were en
dangered and the efficiency of the fire
alarm system lessened by the criminal
act of some miscreant who connected the
tapper line of the system with a wire ot
the electric light department which car
ries 2300 volts. The connection was dis
covered last evening by Superintendent
G. A. Wiese of the municipal light works.
It was made with a copper wire in a
tree on Broadway near San Jose avenue",
through which the light and alarm lines
pass. From the workmanlike manner in
which the job /was done Wiese concludes
that the vandal was an expert lineman.
Why any person should seek to damage
the city is a ! mystery, and the general
belief is that the connecting was done
by some one bent on inflicting damage
to the local x telephone system and wno
made a mistake in joining the fire alarm
and electric light wires when he intended
to connect , the light wire with a tele
phone wire.' The result would have been
that the powerful current would have
burned out all the telephones on the cir
cuit. In speaking of the matter Superin
tendent Wiese said:

Cashier O'Connor states that he has no
knowledge that any employe has signed
the payroll before the amount of his sal
ary was filled in. He denies that a $1400
man had been replaced by a $600 man
who received the higher salary, and he
declares emphatically that wherever a
substitute was employed he received all
the salary that . was opposite his name
on the payroll. He says that Secretary
Richardson was placed on the rolls as
cashier about two years ago on an order
from Washington at a salary of $2600.
This statement effectually disposes of
the charge that Postmaster Montague
was directly or Indirectly instrumental in
having Richardson paid for services which
he never performed.
Richardson has been traced to Lacon
ner. In the State of Washington, where
he is sojourning with his wife. She Is a
resident of that town, and Richardson
went up there about three months ago
and married her.
It is also charged that 51100 per an
num clerks on sick leave for two years
have had their places filled by $600 per
annum substitutes who received $1400 per
annum for such services. Another case
is said to be that of a $1000 per annum
clerk absent more than a year with his
place filled by a JGOO clerk drawing the
salary of $1000.
Latest charges published against the
management ,of the San Francisco post
office are that Daniel S. Richardson has
been drawing $2600 per annum as cash
ier while acting as secretary to the
Postmaster and while the duties of the
cashier have bc n Â»i exclusively performed
by E. A. O'Conriui. who has been known
as the acting cashier for the last ten
years.

Troy had a battle with Dimmick night
before last during one of the dentist'f
violent moods. Of his experiences Troy
said to-day:
Dimmick showed no signs of improvement
during our stay at the camp. In fact" he grew
worse and we were compelled to watch him
closely. Wednesday night he became violent
and attacked us. Before I could restrain him
he struck me over the head with a bottle,
shouting:, "You're trying to kill me."
Then he scrambled cut of the tent, clad only
in his underclothes, and disappeared down the
road. He did not return for several hours.
Thursday morning Dimmick tried to attack
me, and we decided to bring him home. Brit
ton and Mrs. IMmmlck started for Oakland, but

Jumped out, yelling, "You're trying to send

TROY FIGHTS MANIAC.
OAKLAND. Sept. 18.â Violently in
sane was young Dr. Edwin F.
H. Dimmick, the dentist, whose
body was found in a creek bed in
Moraga Valley this morning by a
searching party that had been looking
for the young Oaklander ever since his
disappearance last night from a camp
near the Fish ranch, on the Contra Costa
side of the foothills. For weeks Dimmick
had been giving evidence of a mind de
ranged and it was in the hope that the
outing would do him good that the camp
ing party was arranged. With Dimmick
and his wife went R. E. Troy, Leonard
Campbell and Frank Britton of 755 Grove
street. Troy Is chief ranger of Court
Oakland, Foresters of America, of which
Dimmick was a member, and the latter
refused to make the trip unless Troy ac
companied them.
The remains were sent to Martinez and
are now at the Morgue there. Mrs. Dim
mick, Mr. Troy, and Dr. Dimmick's broth
er are there to testify at the inquest.
The Coroner summoned a jury last night,
but adjourned for a few days j because
he had word from Sheriff Veale, who
went to the place where the doctor was
found, to put off the inquest until his
return, as some things in the case seemed
suspicious. '"'v -
It is strongly suspected that Dlmmick's
insanity was caused by over-indulgence
in cocaine or morphine.
D. S. Mulholland. a rancher, found Dlm
mick's body in the creek near his ranch
house. An hour before the farmer saw
Dimmick running about as if in great pain
and then saw him fall and roll down a
hillside into the creek.
Dimmick resided at 1061 Willow street,
where it was said lÂ»e had been insane for
months.
The young man had been associated
with his father, Dr. Joseph Dimmick, in
dental practice at 473 Fourteenth street.
The parent felt positive that his son was
sane, but from various sources tile story
of the young man's mental condition was
verified. His friends, while averse to go
ing Into details, have said enough to make
it evident that Dimmick had not been of
sound mind for a long time. He was 30
years of age and had been with his father
for twelve years, ever since his gradua
tion from the Oakland High School. The
parents' home is at 2445 Channing way,
Berkeley. The body will. be brought to
this city as soon as the Coroner at Mar
tinez has completed his inquiry as to the
cause of death.

the "Horses and Carts" to come in, as
they were too noisy.
Colonel Choynskl, William Hoff Cook
and George Gallagher are resting their
voices and expect to take a hand In pro
ceedings at the next meeting.
There is a well-defined rumor In Demo
cratic circles that Judges Mogan and Ca
baniss, who were nominated on the Union
Labor party ticket, will be asked to stand
by their party. The plan is to make both
Judges declare they are for Democracy,
and if they decline refuse them the nom
ination on the Democratic ticket.
The "Horses and Carts" held an in
formal meeting at the California Hotel
last evening. Another meeting will be
held on Monday night.
The committee of eighteen appointed by
the various districts of the Union Labor
party held a meeting in Eugene E.
Schmitz's headquarters, at 993 Market
street, last night. All candidates for Su
pervisors on the Union Labor ticket were
present and were called in and interro
gated minutely by the committee. Each
candidate was subjected to a cross-exam
ination. He told his entire history. The
delegates made it a point to ask each
candidate whether he had been an elector
of this city for the past five years. They
will submit their report next Tuesday
night.
There are stormy times ahead for the
Democratic Municipal Convention, to
meet in this city next week. The minor
ity, or "Horses and Carts," as they are
usually called, expect to make things lively
for Gavin McNab. Despite the state'ment
of Chairman Thomas W. Hickey that he
will not permit any delegate to Insult the
convention by placing MeNab in nomina
tion for an office he does not aspire to,
the" O'Brien aggregation intend to carry
out their programme. They will do every
thing possible to delay the convention.
Motions, amendments and roll calls will
be as numerous as Job-chasers after an
election.
"Horses and Carts" Making Prepara

DEMOCRATIC MINORITY
READY FOR HOT SESSION
Toward evening the congress was the
scene of violent altercations between the
various deputies Interested In the election
of .the executive committee of the party.
For a full hour gross personalities were
indulged in.
Prior to adjournment Herr Singer, who
presided and at whose table throughout
the session sat three police officials, an
nounced that he had received informa
t'on that the numerous detectives in the
hall were trying to entice delegates and
others Into compromising conversations.
He therefore warned his comrades to be
extremely careful what they said. De
tectives are posted in all parts of the
town, and show particular interest in the
foreign journalists who are in Dresden
for the Socialist congress.
As fifty-five delegates have given no
tice of their intention to speak, it is prob
able that the congress will sit through
nxet week.
DRESDEN, Sept. IS.â At to-day's session
of iho Socialist Congress Her von Volt
mar spoke for four hours in reply to Herr
Bebel. The essence of his discourse was
that there was no crisis in the party ex
cept a personal crisis, Herr Bebel seeing
with grief his leadership In Parliament
threatened. Herr Bebel, the speaker
added, spoke to the congress as Cromwell
spoke to Parliament and exercised the
right to judge and condemn motives. He
desired to convert the party into a church,
with himself as supreme pontiff.
: NOT IN CONTEMPT.
j Commissioner Hitchcock ruled that his
: subpoenas were not operative outside the
i southern district of New York, except on
request, and that as a result the persons
Eubpoenaed in Brooklyn were not in con
tempt.
To a further statement that the defense
wished to subpoena George F. Miller,
manager of the Brandt-Dent Company,
and others to prove that there was no
evidence, as alleged in the indictment, of
the payment of money to Beavers, Dis
trict Attorney Burnett replied that from
what the attorney for the defense pro
posed to prove it was evidently the inten
tion of the defense to turn the examina
tion into a trial. After adjourning until
next Tuesday counsel for the defense, ac
companied by Commissioner Hitchcock
and Messrs. Bushnell and Wise, appeared
before United States District Judge Holt
for a process compelling District Attor
ney Youngs and his stenographer. Miss
Wrenn, to obey the subpoena and appear
before Commissioner Hitchcock Tuesday.
Judge Holt ruled that to bring the mat
ter before him the defense would have to
-make an application to punish for con
tempt the witnesses who had disobeyed
the subpoenas.
Later the application was formally
made. Judge Holt being asked to decide
the question at issue some time before the
next hearing, on Tuesday next.
No argument was made and all pro
ceedings closed for the day.
For the first time on record in this district
the Government seeks to have this accused
man sent to Brooklyn without the preliminary
examination that has been accorded every de
fendant arraJsiied for extradition in a quar
ter of a century-
We want to know whom the Government
seeks to shield by this Indictment. We contend
that ir permitted to go Into this case here
we will prove that there is not only a
lack of cause to believe that a crime has been
committed, but so far as Beavers is con
cerned it iÂ« a. cue of absolute lnnnocence and
we hoi>e to prove It. But for some reason the
Government seeks to suppreis the evidence.
General Burnett said the defendant had
been indicted in the eastern district and
would be given the opportunity to prove
his innocence there in due time.
NEW YORK. Sept. 18.â At' the examina
tion of George W. Beavers, the indicted
postal official, charged with conspiracy
I with the Brandt-Dent Manufacturing
Company to defraud the Government,
which was resumed to-day. Commis
sioner Hitchcock announced that lie had
decided to overrule the motion made' by
the defense at the previous hearing to
dismiss the proceedings because of the
' invalidity of the indictment. The defense
contended that the indictment charged
three separate and distinct offenses under
one section of the Federal statutes in
stead of one as required by law. He also
Â¦ repeated his ruling that the properly cer
tified copy of the indictment returned in
Brooklyn was sufficient evidence to make
: out a case of probable cause and to war
'. rent the return of the accused, properly
â¢ identified, to the district wherein the in
; dlctment was returned.
It developed in the course of the exam
; ination. and was admitted upon the rec
' ord by District Attorney Burnett, that
subpoenas had been served by the defense
upon District Attorney Youngs in Brook
lyn and his stenographer and a subpoena
for the production of certain papers upon
Postmasttr General Payne, the defense
! s-tating that It wanted the Government to
â¢ make out its case before the District
; Commissioner in New York, in order that
! the defense might prove that Beavers had
! nothing whatever to do with the making
' of the contract between the Government
, and the Brandt-Dent Company. The sub
; poÂ«nas had been ignored.
j DECLARES BEAVERS INNOCENT.
! Attorney Stivers for the defense said:
DANGER PASSES
FOR SIR THOMAS
Business has made moderate progress
during the past week, despite unusual
opposition from the elements. When all
other industries are to a considerable de
gree dependent upon agricultural condi
tions, reports ot serious injury to crops
by cold and wet weather are not calcu
lated to stimulate confidence. Subsequent
corrections indicated that the amount ot
damage had been exaggerated, as usual,
and prospects brightened.
The car shortage is beginning to be felt,
especially in the Pittsburg district, where
sufficient labor cannot be secured for
handling freight. Manufacturing plants
are well occupied as a rule, even the tex
tile mills reporting less idle machinery,
and at Chicago there is notable pressure
for implements and hardware. Lumber
is in better demand as structural ac
tivity revives. Payments are seasonably
prompt, except where the late crops de
lay settlements, and the outlook for fall
and winter business contains much that
is encouraging. Railway earnings thus
far reported for September show an aver
age gain of 10.36 over last year. In the
iron and steel industry quotations have
been declining for some months, and a
large tonnage of business Is held back in
the expectation that still better terms
may be offered. Uneasiness over the la
bor situation aggravates the difficulty,
although the latest developments In the
building trades are most encouraging in
this respect.
Failures this week were 219 In the Unit
ed States, against 199 last year, and 19
in Canada, compared with 25 a year ago.
Conditions still display Irregularity, but
except where crop and weather develop
ments have been distinctly unfavorable
the tendency is still to take a favorable
view of the general outlook for fall and
winter trade. Heavy rains and killing
frosts in the Northwest and In portions
of the West, with drouth, followed by
cool weather and destructive wind and
rain storms along the Atlantic coast have
tended to retard expansion in fall trade
In wide sections of the country. All sec
tions, however, have not been affected
alike. The Northwest returns relatively
the poorest reports as to the current
distributive trade, while the Southwest
and Pacific Coast and some sections ot
the South give excellent reports of busi
ness already booked or In prospect.
The outlook for average crops is still a
good one. Nothing in the nature of ac
tual shortages as occurred in 1901 is in
dicated, and while trade opinion prob
ably inclines to the view that the boom
is over in several industries, none the
less the belief is maintained that a good
average fall and winter business is in
prospect.
Wheat, Including flour, exports for the
week ending with September 17 aggregate
1,909,083 bushels, against 3,045,040 last
week, 5,435,323 this week last year, 3,840,574
in 1901 and 3,535,857 in 1900.
Business failures in the United States
for the week ending with September 17
number 170, against 165 last week, 182 in
the like week of 1902, 158 in 1901, 1S3 in
1900 and 147 in 1899.
In Canada failures for the week num
ber 19, against 12 last week and 18 in this
week a year ago.

ALAMEDA, SeDt. IS.â Resolutions dis
avowing the incendiary utterances of
Charles W*. Bassett, who urged at a meet
ing of the Board of Trade last Friday
night that tar, feathers and rope be ap
plied to the City Trustees because of
their attitude in the matter of the rail
road franchises, were adopted by the
Board of Trade at a meeting held to
night. Dr. J. A. Roberts wanted Baa
sett's statements supported end in tha
course of his remarks said that "kid
gloves and soft words should not be used
with thp City Trustees."
In the absence of Henry Rosenthal,
president of the Board of Tndo, Green
B. Majors, a non-member, acte.l as chair
man of the meeting. The following wers
appointed as a committee to Investigate
and report upon the cost of installing a
municipal train and ferry system: Georga
F. Weeks, E. H. Lancel. Henry Rosen
thai, I. N. Chapman. II. A. Thompson.
The resolutions adopted were introduced
by Halvor Haueh and were as lollows:
Whereas. We. the citizens of Alameda, are
and have been meeting under the auspices of
the Hoard of Trade of Alameda for the sola
and only purpose of Insisting upon our right*
to have the questions of granting railroad fran
chises reterred to a vote of the people; and.
The strikers during the afternoon sent
a committee to confer with President Fos
ter regarding the reinstatement of Watch
man McDonald, whose dismissal, they
claim, is their only grievance, but the
president of the road declined to receive
the committee. It was later announced
that the Sailors' T'nion of this city had
agreed to send men over this morninp to
take the places of the deckhands who had
gone out on a strike.
A dispatch from Santa Rosa last even-
Ing stated that the section hands all along
the line cf the California Northwestern
road "had quit work in response to an or
der from the strike committee of the U.
15. R. E.. but this bit of news did not seem
to worry the railroad officials, who said
that there are few men working along
the road and that th^se so engaged were
simply doinc unimportant repair work,
â¢which could be deferred.
Sheriff Taylor of Marin County kept a
force of deputies on guard at the Cali
fornia Northwestern Railroad's shops all
night and compiled the saloons of the
town to close at 9 o'clock, a measure
which the officer deemed advisable in
view of the fact that during the previous
day the majority of the strikers had been
paid o!T and the temptation to indulge in
lirjuor might lead to trouble.
At Tiburon during the early part of the
day the members of the C B. R. E. suc
<-eoded in inducing a few laborers to quit
work, but all efforts to persuade the Io
comotlre engineers to join the strikers
proved futile. About fourteen engineers
positively refused to go out or lend their
support in any way to the strike move
ment. Considerable ill feeline was ex
pressed by many of the strikers because
a number of members of the Marine Fire
men's Union went to work on the ferry
boats, but the latter claimed t*hat they
properly belonged there and would pay
no heed to the protests of the U. B. R.
E.. with which their organization has no
affiliation.
There was no material change yester
day In the strike situation on the Califor
nia Northwestern, a fact which both sides
frankly admitted, although the contending
forces differed somewhat as to the prob
able outcome. The representatives of the
I'nlted Brotherhood of Railroad Kmployes
declared that the strike would certainly
< xtend to all the departments of the road
unless Watchman McDonald was rein
stated in his old position, bat President
l'oster scoffed at any such possibility.
claiming 1 that he had the assurance of
numerous employes of the company that
they would remain loyal to the road.
Among these he eaid were the engineers,
tircmen and trainmen, who are not in
sympathy with the strike and are not
affiliated with the brotherhood. Review
ing the situation, President Foster said:
I f j*nt the greater Tart of the day over at
Tiburon and found matters very quiet there.
The men who are out on a strike have fhown
no diprotltinn to carry matters to an extreme
and I do not fear any serious trouble. Pursu
ant to a te!esrra!>hii % rÂ»quâ¬*t made by mo. our
niperintender.t at Tiburon t-j-day roi>orted that
the total number <,f n,Â»n who have struck at
our yards on that wide of the bay is sixty-Fix,
to which are to be aiid-d about n dozen men
r>n this t=ide. among them being the freiRht
â¢Â¦.: â¢Â¦Â¦ ' Â¦ !Â¦ Â»>nd deckhands of th<Â» ferry-boats. WÂ«
hivp received many applications for employ
ment, but as yet no effort has been ma<JÂ«> to
till the places of the fhojunfii or the freight
bandlers on this ?i<1Â» of the bay.
It is not the intention of the company to
< ir:;i!oy f-hotjrun men and bring about any
dash on the docks'. We will receive freisht sn
!nnÂ»r as we feel that Â«e are able to handle it
and nh<>n we find we cannot it will rest with
the public whether or not freight traffic is> to be
allowed over our lines. The only guards we
have are thr-se en our own property and any
trespassing there will, of course, be met with
proper resistance, but at ail time* within the
law. Our trains are a'.l running and tho only
lneom-enienoe the company is experiencing is
in its repair shops. It is possible that the
Ftrikers will carry the fight farther Â«p the
line Rj-.d induce pome of the Faction men to
join them, but I am net worrying a srrcat deal
over the matter. There is not the slighteFt
chance cf the Ftrikers tyin? tip the road, as I
p.m '.nformrd they have threatened to do.

The general list held well during the flirt

The shipping demand for Potatoes was
email, but local trading was fair and as re
ceipts were light prlcea were steady. Sweet
Potatoes continued easy. Supplies were large
and Included much poor stock, which dragged
at the minimum quotation. Onions ,. were In
free supply and unchanged. Changes'in veg-*
etables were slight. Supplies of all descrip
tions wore ample and the demand was nothing
extra. Tomatoes 1 arrived freely and were a
little easier. Occasional lots sold at 75c per
box. but the quotations cover the general run
of offerings. Lima Beans were offering more
freely than on' the preceding day and prices
had a wider range. The demand, however,
was good, and choice offerings cleaned up
readily. String Beans were In small supply
and cleaned up quickly at firmer rates. The I
other vegetables stood about as previously :
quoted.

sumptive demand was limited dealers contin
ued to exact high prlcrs for choice offerings.

that .the word "description" stood for the

this explanation Eisenschimmel sought to
prove that his statement yesterday in the
Police Court tallied exactly with his evi
dence given before the Coroner.
Alfred Voligny, a conductor on, the Cal
ifornia-street line, was then called to the
witness stand. His testimony was of lit
tle value to the prosecution. The witness
testified that as a member of the order
of Odd Fellows, to which Martin L.
Bowers belonged, he had visited Bowers
at his home and at the hospital, once a
week. The prosecution sought to show
by the witness that Bowers had not re
ceived the same proper treatment at his
home as he had received at the Waldeck
sanatorium, but Attorney Drury was suc
cessful in keeping out the testimony as
not being material to the case. The fur

While attempting to dodge between
cars headed in opposite directions on
Powell street. Dr. J. Coplin Stinson of 533
Sutter street wrecked his automobile and
with Miss F. Meyers, who resides at the
Kentlworth Hotel, was thrown from the
vehicle to the pavement. Neither was
Injured seriously. The accident happened
in front of the Columbia Theater about
9 o'clock last evening.
One of the cars which caused the ac
cident was standing in front of the thea
ter preparatory to moving on the turn
table. The other car. in charge of Grip
man Rellly and Conductor Tutt, was on
the .table.. Stinson came down Powell
street and finding the street to his right
blocked by carriages steered behind the
car going down and over the track used
by the car Just moving from the turn
table. He then attempted to Bwing to
his richt and cross In front of the first
named car. From the statements of the
railroad officials both cars were in mo
tion. Stinson says they were not, at least
until after he had crossed behind the
downtown car. At any rate his machine
was pinched between the two cars and
badlv- smashed. . .
Â¦ ,When the crash came both Stinson and
Miss Meyers were thrown out of the
vehicle. The gripmen, applied their brakes
immediately and prevented further Oc
cident. When the couple was picked up
by spectators,' who rushed to their as
sistance, it waa found that the physician,
with the exception of a slight bruise of
the knee, escaped unscathed. , Miss
Meyers, however, was not so fortunate.
She was bruised about the legs and hips
and the right' side of her head.. The
young lady refused to be taken to the
Receiving Hospital and was taken to the
Kenilworth.in a hack by her escort.

Yesterday Tuthill went down to the
Third and Townsend street depot and in
formed the passenger agent there that
he wanted to have his special aluminum
car put in order so that he might go to
Germany with his wife. He became such
a nuisance that the officials had him ar
rested. Since arriving at the hospital for
the second time Tuthill has lost his rea
son completely, and his condition has be
come critical as well as pitiful.
It was learned that the "unfortunate
man had been drinking heavily, and this
is thought to be the cause of his mental
collapse. â¢ Â¦ .
Tuthill is evidently a man of refinement
and means. He is about 40 years of age
and well dressed. From papers . in his
pocket it was learned that he Is a resi
dent of Seattle and that he is a property
owner in that city. A number of blank
checks were also discovered among his
effects, but only a small amount of
money.

The witness- testified that in his opinion
the word "arsenic" in the forgea prescrip
tion was in natural handwriting, while
the name "McLaughlin" was disguised.
The attorney for the defense con
fronted the witness with his evidence giv
en before the Coroner, the record show
ing that the witness had said that the en
tire prescription was in a natural hand
writing. Witness Eisenschimmel explained
ths.t the difference in testimony was due
to an error on the part Of the shorthand
reporter who took down the evidence giv
en before the Coroner. The witness said
that the word "prescription" in the rec
ord should have been "description" and
that the evidence before the . Coroner
chould read that there waa no disguise In
the "description." Toe witness explained
Carl Eisenschimmel, the handwriting ex
pert, was called to the witness stand by
the prosecution. He identified the forged
prescription for arsenic as being in the
same handwriting as the examples of
writing of Mrs. Bowers given to the po
lice and also similar to a letter written to
Harry Bowers by Mrs. Martin L. Bow
ers, one of the defendants.
Attorney Drury sought in cross
examination to prove that Drue
Clerk Peterson was mistaken in his iden
tity of Mrs. Sutton and that the descrip
tion he save to the detective led the of
â¢flcer to bring Mrs. Harry Bowers to the
drug store for identification.
?/Â£Â« * ?. Sergeant Thomas L. Ryan
testified to arresting Mrs. Bowers and
her sister. Mrs. Sutton. He also told of
pojng to the drug Ftore at the corner of
Fifth and Clementina streets on the night
of August 27 and finding the forged pre-
Bcripuon for arsenic to which the name
* McLau ShÂ»n" was attached
Xne witness recounted a number of
conversations held with Mr*. Bowerland
Mrs Sutton at the office of the Chief of
Police, which statements have been pub
lished the gist of the statement* of the
accused women being a general denial of
the theory of the police and prosecution
on the murder of Martin L. Bowere The
detective recounted how he had taken
Mte. Harry Bowers and Mrs. Sutton to
the drug store in question and that Drug
Clerk Peterson had identified Mrs. Sut
ton as the person who had presented the
forged prescription for the arsenic.
WRITING EXPERT OU STAND.
At the close of the examination of Ler
vey Attorney Drury moved to strike out
all the testimony of the witness, and
Judge Cabaniss took the motion under
advisement.
The prosecution failed to prove by Ler
vey a single Incident that would tend to
strengthen the theory that Mrs. Bowers
and her sister had murdered Martin
Bowers by administering arsenic to him
or that love for the witness was the
motive for the crime.
The grist of I^ervey's testimony was
that he had been acquainted with Mrs.
Martin L. Bowers for some months pre
vious to the death of her husband. He
admitted visiting her frequently at her
home and to keeping engagements with
her at a number of saloons. He also
reluctantly testified that Mrs. Bowers had
called on him on the day her husband
died and that he ppent the night at her
home and also the following night. Not
a particle of evidence was produced by
the prosecution to show that anv illicit
relations had existed between Lervey
and Mrs. Bowers, and the prosecution
failed to prove by the witness that he
had the watch of Mrs. Bowers in his
possession when he was arrested by the
police. He admitted that Mrs. Bowers
had given him the watch, and Detective
.Ryan later on testified that Mrs. Bowers
had informed him that she had given the
"natch to Lervcy for safe keeping.
DETECTIVE BYAN TESTIFIES.
Lervey, or O'Leary, hesitated to answer
the many questions put to him. He
ehowed that he was nervous and realized
the position he was placed in. Questions
had to be repeated to him arid read by
the court stenographer, and Judge Ca
baniss was kept busy in explaining the
questions propounded to Lervey and pass
ing upon the rapid-fire ODJectlons of at
torney for the defense.
HESITATES TO ANSWEB.
In order to strengthen the contention of
the u* fense that the actual cause of death
of Martin L. Bowers had not been proved,
the attorneys for Mrs. Bowers and Mrs.
Eutton placed Autopsy Surgeon Bacl
galupi on the witness stand. The doctor
tc-stified that he had only removed the
stomach cf Martin L.. Bowers at the au
topsy and twe portions of the brain for
analysis by" tho City Chemist. So far the
pros'-cutluii has not proved the cause of
death of Bowers to be arsenical
pcisoning. Tho evidence admitted proves
that Bowers' death was due to fatty de
peneration of the kidneys, which might
have been caused by arsenic or by natural
causes or from many other reasons.
Patrick I^rvey. alias O'Leary, was
thtn x>ut on tho witness stand by the
prosecution. Lervey has been in cus
tody of the police for some weeks, and
he proved either a stupid or an unwill
ing witness. His examination by Dis
trict Attorney Byington disclosed nothing
of material value, and the attorneys for
the defense declined to cross-examine
him.
Attorney Drury forced Expert Carl
Eisenchimmei. the man who poses as
as knowing al! about handwriting, to con
t'adict limself. He made the wltners for
the prosecution admit that the testimony
he save yesterday was not the Fame as
he gave before the Coroner in the same
case.
' The day's proceedings were mainly
taken up by Attorney Frank Drury for
the defense, who scored an important
point and succeeded in keeping from the
record considerable testimony that the
prosecution desired to cet in.
Tfte principal witness la the case, Pat
rick IxTvty, alias O'LÂ«eary. on whose tes
timony the prosecution relies to prove a
rnolSve for the murder, was made to
Frtcna a very uncomfortable hour on the
witness stand. Every question made
by the prosecution was met by
& cross-Sre of objections on the
part of th<_- attorney for the defense, and
though JuOge Cabaniss was willing to al
low every latitude in the introduction of
evidence, the defense scored at every
point. Lervty. or O'Leary. as he is
known, madf a poor showing and the
prosecution simply succeeded in proving
by his evidence that he had known Mrs.
Bcwers, the wife of the deceased, for
Fome months and had visited her at her
hem*- and met her at other places. Not a
particle of evidence was elicited from
Lervey to show that he had the slightest
connection with the alleged murder of
Bowers or that he figured in any manner
as a motive for the murder, if Buch took
place.
DEFENSE SCOHES VICTORY.
Further hearing cf testimony in the
case of Mrs. Martha E. Bowers and her
sister, Mrs. Zylphia C. Sutton. charged

husband, Martin L. Bowers, by the ad

A suggestion that hay and other ma
terial in the park be insured was consid
ered by Commissioners Lloyd and Sulli
van. The point was raised that the char
ter did not give the Commissioners au
thority to enter into a contract for in
surance and therefore the policy, if is
sued, might be void.
Bids as follows were received for sup
plying 1500 cubic yards of mission loam
for Columbia Square: Daniel O'Day. 90
cents per cubic yard; Sullivan & Sons. 63
cents; Peter McHugh. 84 cents: A. B.

The contract was awarded to Sullivan &

IN MEMORY OF SCOTT.
The following resolutions, introduced by
Commissioner Sullivan, were unanimously
adopted:
Whereas, Irvlns M. Scott, one of the former
Park Commissioners, has lately died: and
Whereas, He waa pre-eminently distinguished
for qualities that make for good government
and for a trust such as the Park Commission;
and
Whereas. The ability that wan shown in
the construction of the battleship Oregon was
freely ttiven to the care of Golden Gate Park,
to the end that it might be. with the leaat
possible expense, the pleasure ground of . our
citizens; and
Whereas. This talent was Joined to a nature
strikingly sociable an* gentle; therefore be It
Resolved. That we. the members of this
Park Commission, regret his death as a dis
tinct loss to the community.
Resolved. That this preamble and resolutions
be spread upon the minutes of the beard and
that an engrossed copy thereof be forwarded
to his family. '
Commissioner Sullivan, to whom was re
ferred the matter of the printing of the
report of the Park Commission, submitted
the following:
Every page of the report as printed is full
of grammatical errors and should be revised
and reprinted. There is no necessity far print
ing the long list of shrubs and trees and (low
ers, which fill many pages, and these can.
with advantage, be eliminated. I favor pay

pleted the Job, but I think he ought to make
the changes required at the laast possible ex
pense. Kay under $100. ' He tells me that the

The board, on motion of M. Jasper Mc-
Donald, authorized Superintendent John
McLaren to accept the honor of appoint
ment as member of the park census com
mittee of the American Park and Out
door Art Association. The correspond
ence soliciting the services of Mr. Mc-
Laren shows that he is recognized as a
park expert of national renown.
The superintendent was authorized to
purchase sixty-five stone lanterns of a
collection at Kobe, Japan. The price is
$225.
and mufflers should be applied to sup
press the noise. After full discussion, In
which all the Commissioners Joined, a
motion prevailed to refer tne subject to
President Spreckels with instructions to
select a route by which the automobiles
could be run to the Cliff House from the
south drive.
On motion of Commissioner Altraan a
vote of thanks was tendered to Mrs.
Grayson Crane for a valuable contribu
tion to the natural history department of
the Memorial Museum. The collection
embraces many birdskins. Commissioner
A. Altman said it was a beautiful col
lection. The plumage of the birds was
exceptionally attractive. Max Braverman
of Visalia was thanked for a gift of ob
solete paper money and many other
articles. The paper money package con
tained Confederate notes and State bills.
The secretary presented "a report of the
receipts and expenses of the children's
playground for thirteen months ending
July 31, 1903. The receipts were shown to
be 127.039 45. The disbursements were
S20.6S0 07. The profit was therefore $6353 3S.
The Question arose whether the charges
should be reduced or the attractions of
the playground enhanced. Commissioner
Reuben H. Lloyd said the figures of re
ceipt and disbursement were obtained in
order to bring the subject before the
board for definite action. Commissioner
M. Jasper McDonald favored new equip
ment for the quartersâ new horses and
new merry-go-round. President Spreckels
suggested the use of electric power instead
of steam and recommended the spending
of the surplus to make the playgrounds
still more attractive. Similar sentiments
were expressed by Commissioners Sulli
van and Altman. On motion Superintend
ent McLaren was authorized to get esti
mates of the cost of new horses, improved
equipment and electric connection.
POLICE PROTECTION NEEDED.
Failure of the city government to afford
adequate police protection in Golden Gate
Park was dwelt upon by the Commission
ers. The members of the board expressed
their minds with refreshing frankness.
President Spreckels remarked that he had
spoken directly to the Chief of Police on
the subject. Mr. Lloyd fancied that the
Chief was not to blame. The trouble was
that the number of policemen was not
sufficient.
SPEED OF AUTOMOBZLES.
Commissioner Lloyd held that the speed
should not exceed eight miles an hour
Commissioner Frank J. Sullivan spoke
of the restriction placed on automobiles
in Prospect Park, Brooklyn. N. Y., where
only one avenue was opened to such ma
chines; He remarked that the history of
the automobile was a history of blood
and advised that measures should - be
adopted to limit the speed of automo
miles on the great highway.
Commissioner Sullivan suggested that
the superintendent be authorized to ex
pend $500 in boring an artesian well to
make sure of more water in the event
of the surface. well becoming exhausted.
The â¢ subject of water" supply for the
park was discussed at considerable length.
The commission decided to invite bids
for another pump. The superintendent
was directed .to go ahead with artesian
well development. It was the judgment
of the board that the windmill had proved
remarkably successful. There Is no steam
or electric power connected with the plant.
The wind furnishes all the power and
the power is greatest during the summer
months, when water Is most needed.- ' t
The board on motion of Commissioner
Lloyd decided to open the iway for auto
mobiles to reach the Cliff House from the
Ocean boulevard or great highway.. The
automobiles are now allowed to. use the
south drive of the park out to the ocean.
It is proposed that an ordinance shall
be framed which will allow the machines
to run along the ocean beach highway
to the north side of the park and thence
via Forty-seventh avenue to Sutro
Heights and the Cliff House. It was
the judgment of the Commissioners that
the direct road from the highway to the
Cliff House was too steep and narrow
and so crowded with carriages and pe
destrians at certain hours that it would
not be prudent to admit automobiles to
that road.
WATER SUPPLY ABUNDANT.
Commissioner Lloyd expressed the opin
ion that the supply of water was abun
dant. There was no expense to speak of
attached to the pumping of the water, as
the wind eave the power.
The Park Commissioners met yesterday
afternoon at the lodge in Golden Gate
Park. All the members of the board at
tended and the president. A. B.' Spreck
els, presided. The board decided by unan
imous vote to put In another pump at
the windmill on the ocean beach. The
additional pump, together with an exten
sion of the well, will cost $2000. It' is
estimated that the pump will cost $1365.
The mill at present raises 20,000 gallons
an hour, lifting the water from the well
to the reservoir one mile distant and 150
feet higher than the plant.
President Spreckels explained that the
supply could be Increased to 40,000 gal
lons per hour by adding another pump to
the plant. He did not entertain the
slightest doubt concerning the capacity
of the well. The constant operation of
the pumps would not exhaust the flow.
â¢Commissioner McDonald asked if more
water was needed. Mr. Spreckels replied:
"We cannot get too much water, j "We
need all we can get to irrigate that sec
tion of the park near the ocean. We
need it for trees and meadows. There is
a continuous flow of water in the well.
The power of the mill, seventy horse, is
ample to operate another pump and 'we
can at very little expense double our wa
ter supply."
Success of the Dutch Wind
mill Is Recognized by
the Board.
