LAS PALMAS, Sept. 2.â It is reported
that the French cruiser Gallilee bom
barded Cape Juby on Monday last. No
confirmation of the report, however, is
yet. at hand. The attack on Cape Juby
is undoubtedly . connected with M.
Jacques Lebaudy's empire.
Lebaudy announced he was going to
found a new country on the west coast
of Africa, near this point, of which he
was -to be sole sovereign. He fitted out
an expedition and landed. But It hap
pened that the locality was in Moorish
territory and Morroccan authorities cap
tured five of his party, refusing to give
them up. An expedition was fitted out by
the Paris Journal to rescue them and the
French Government is also said to have
taken steps to that end.

Mrs. Wesley A. Tucker lives at 809 St
Paul street. She had been at Aix les
Bains, France, with her daughter, Mrs.
Howard Ridgley. Mrs. Tucker was noti
fied by cable that the safe deposit box
had been railed and she sailed Immedi
ately for home. Mrs. George H. Glover of

here. .
Tucker was connected with tlie former
shoe firm of Tucker, Smith & Co., of
which firm his father was a member. He

more and Elkridge Fox Hunting clubs.
He was recently made the defendant in
a suit brought by Miss Sarah G. Morris

J Â¦ Special Dispatch to The Call.
After hand-to-hand conflicts with the
Indians the cowboys succeeded in reach
ing open ground, where they soon proved
their superiority and compelled the In
dians to seek cover. They had lost only
two of their party, but the son of their
patron was among the slain. They had
experienced a hard fight, and although
they had. come out victorious, Diaz and
his men felt no inclination to follow the
Indians back again into the hills. They
retreated to the ranch, from which a
messenger was sent out summoning aid.
As soon as the news of the fight reached
Guaymas Federal forces of the militia
district were ordered to go in pursuit of
the Indians. It is thought that the Yaquis
exhausted their supply of ammunition In
the fight and the soldiers expect to have
little difficulty in breaking up the band.
HAND-TO-HAND STRIFE.
Diaz learned of the presence of the
Yaquis in the country from one of' the
men whom they attacked and pursued,
but who succeeded In escaping them. He
at once recruited an attacking party from
among his cowboys and went in the direc
tion of- the place where the Indians had
been seen. The Yaquls had fled to a
range of mountains several miles back of
the ranch, where they were strongly in
trenched, there being about twenty-flve
or thirty in the band, as far as the Mex
icans could estimate.
The Indians sent out a handful of men
to decoy the unsuspecting cowboys, who
believed they composed the entire party.
When attacked the Indians fled in the
direction of the. spot where their com
rades were intrenched, and in this way
Diaz and his men were" drawn into the
trap. . A hot lire was poured in upon them
from all sides and they would have be
come completely demoralized but for Diaz,
who rallied his horsemen after their first
fright and dashed at their head up a side
canyon.
FIGHT III MOUNTAINS.
The Mexican party had gone in pursuit
of the Yaquls and had been ambushed
and the whole party narrowly escaped be
ing massacred. Their leader kept a cool
head and this alone saved him. for the
men took courage and fought fiercely to
save themselves from the howling sav
ages.
The report says that many Indians, one
cowboy and Alejandro Diaz, the son of
the leader, were killed in the engagement.
A number of bodies of Indians were
found and more are believed to have been
fatally shot. ! ..-..â¢ *
GUATMAS, Mexico, Sept. 2.â A special

Monday between a band of Yaqul Indians
and fourteen cowboys, under the leader

The trip was made in forty-five min
utes. The party alighted and visited the
creek. Measurements were taken, after
which Mayor Thomas made known the
object of the visit as well as the result of
the investigations.
"We must do something," said Mayor*
Thomas, "in order that our citizens may
be supplied with water and so that our
homes will be protected in case of fire.
The present company Is all right, but it
cannot supply us with enough Water." At
the present time we are only getting
about 100,000 gallons per day. We need
250,000 gallons and soon will need 400,000
gallons. The idea is to pipe this water
down to Sausalito. a distance of about
twenty miles, when the North Shore Com
pany finishes its tunnel through White's
hill. The railroad people say the pipe can
be run through that way. If this plan
proves to be a feasible one, it will afford
us a great relief. Gentlemen, the engi
neers say that at the present time nearly
a million gallons of water flow down this
creek In the twenty-four hours. This is
a dry month. In other" months it will be
a much larger amount." :
Other short speeches were made by
Messrs. Kilgarif, Tiffany, Martin .and
Hughes and the party returned home.
Other sites will be visited and proposi
tions considered later.
Lagunitas Creek was the only place
visited to-day, but since the water cor
porations have found out that the Sausa.
litans mean business they too are anx
ious- that their works be investigated 1 .

The shooting, ; Dr. Edson declared, was
undoubtedly committed in a moment of
maniacal frenzy.
and Mrs. Pullen were absolutely, false.
His brother, he said, had recently been
acting - very strangely and had admitted
that he' was involved in financial difficul
ties. His . family, . Dr. Edson said, had
become. so alarmed , over his mental con
dition that arrangements had been made
to have him examined by an' alienist.
The examination of Weilbrenner was
held this evening. Dr. George A. Stewart
and Dr. Barnes conducted the examina
tion. Weilbrenner was declared by them
to be insane. He was taken to Mineola.
It. I., on an evening train and placed in
the custory of the county authorities..
Weilbrenner has been practicing with his
revolver recently, but he would give no
reason for his interest in marksmanship,
and to-day said he could not shoot very
well. â¢
The incident is the first serious occur
rence of the kind during the President's,
summer sojourn at Sagamore' Hill. It
has demonstrated completely, in the opin
ion of- officials here, the wisdom of the
close and systematic guard which Is. main
tained at all times over the President.
He is exposed frequently, it . is true, to
assault, but every care that human agen
cies can devise Is exercised constantly to
insure his personal safety and Immunity
from danger^ Personally he was not per-,
turbed by the Weilbrenner Incident, but,
although the maintenance of the guard
Is often distasteful to him, he thoroughly
realizes the necessity, . in the circum
stances,, of having made as certain as
possible' the personal safety of the Presi
dent of the United States. .-'_.-"
DECLARED INSANJE.
Weilbrenner was arraigned to-day be
fore Justice Franklin on complaint of the
secret service operatives who placed him
under arrest. Weilbrenner's brother, Wil
liam, was present at the examination. Jus
tice Franklin questioned the prisoner
about his movements last night. His re
plies were made in a quiet tone of voice,
but they indicated apparently beyond a
doubt that the -man Is crazy. Asked why
he went to Sagamore Hill, he replied:
"I went to see the President about his
daughter Alice." â¢ *.
"Had you an engagement with the Presr
ident?" Â¦' . '->.
"Yes." ~ Â¦ " - . :-r'.'V;
"How was that engagement made?"
Â¦ "I talked with the President last night,"
replied Weilbrenner.
"How did you talk with him?"
"Oh, I Just talked."
"A sort of wireless talk, was it?"
"Yes: that is. it, a wireless talk."
"Why did you want to see the Presi
dent about Miss Alice?"
"I wanted to marry her."
"Did you ever see Miss Roosevelt?"
"Yes; I saw her night before last."
"Where did you see her?" .
"At myhou8e." x \ >Â¦'.
."Did she go there?" . Â¦
: "Yes; she came in a red automobile."
"Who accompanied her?" l v -
"Her brother Theodore." />*">{-';
Justice Franklin, after the examination,"
said he would hold Weilbrenner until
an inquiry of lunacy could be held upon'
his case. ' '. ' .
WEILBRENNER ARRAIGNED.
Weflbrenner was brought to the village
and locked up.' While he talked ration
ally to the officers â¢ last night, it seems
evident from his conversation to-day that
he is demented. He said that He had re
ceived a. telegraphic communication from
the President, bidding him call at Saga
more Hill. Weilbrenner's buggy was ta
ken to a local livery barn. When asked
what had become of the rig, Weilbrenner
replied: - ' ...
"Oh, the President, has taken care of it.
That's all right."
WellbrenneT is regarded by those who
have seen him to be a dangerous lunatic.
At Syosset it is learned that the man Is
the son of a truck farmer and is- one of
three boys. He has two sisters, j The
family is respectable and is held in gen
eral esteem. -
Weilbrenner several years ago had a
nervous attack which rendered him men
tally helpless, for a day or two, but his
family supposed that he had been quite
restored by medical treatment. Since then
he had manifested no symptoms of men
tal aberration.,
Just before 11 o'clock the .man returned
a third time and demanded of the officer
that he be permitted to see the Presi
dent at once. " It was at this moment that
the President appeared and the officer's
quickness alone prevented Weilbrenner
from firing point blanfc at the Chief Ex
ecutive.
see him. As it was long after the hours
when visitors are received, the officer de
clined to permit him to go to the house.
The man insisted, but the officer turned
him away.
Soon afterward Weilbrenner returned
and again insisted that he be allowed to
seo the President, if only for a minute.
This time he was ordered away and
warned not to return. Â¦

In terror Mrs. Pullen started to run
from the room. She had gone but a few
steps when' four pistol shots rang out
in quick succession. The first bullet tore
Mrs. Pullen's left cheek and the second
entered the right side of her head.
According to Woods, Edson looked at
the woman for a moment and then turned
the muzzle of the revolver to his own
head, firing, two shots almost simulta
neously. Both entered about the middle
of the forehead and he fell, his head
striking and resting on the feet of Mrs.
Pullen's body. i
At the first' shot Dr. Edson and Mrs.
Edson rushed to the door of the dining-"
room, reaching there Just as Edson fired
the shots, that ended his own life. Mrs.
Edson fell to the floor in .a faint.
Coroner Jackson, after making a thor
ough examination of the house, said that
the evidence showed- that the murder and
suicide were . premeditated ; that . he had
found letters and other, papers in Ed
son's possession which showed that he
had had a love .affair.
Mr. Pullen, the husband of the murdered
woman and who is a vestryman of St.*
Michael's Church, made a statement to
night, in which he branded Edson as a de
faulter and forger and said that he had
stolen from the funds of St. Michael's
Church. Ho also declared that Edson had
attempted to- kill. Mrs. Edson, but missed
and killed Mrs. Pullen by error. Puljen's
statement was not borne out by the in
vestigation of Coroner's Physician : Han-
Ion, who found powder marks on the dead
woman's face, showing that the pistol
must have been held very close.' Â¦Â¦Â¦â¢.
Dr. Cyrus Edson; a brother of the sui
cide, said to-night that the intimations
of imprqper relations between his brother
FLEES FOB HER LIFE.
Mrs. Edson spent last night with her
friend, Mrs. Pullen. She was about to
go out this morning when a r.otÂ£ came
from Edson asking that Mrs. Pullen ac
conipany his wife to where he was. Ed
son, his'wife, Mrs. Pullen and Dr. David
O. Edson, a brother of Edson, met in
Edson's home. During the conversation
in the dining-room Edson is said to have
turned to Mrs. Pullen and suggested that
she leave her home with him and go to
some other State, where they could be
happy. Mrs. Edson was horriiled. Mrs.
Pullen turned away in disgust. Dr. Ed
son, after sharply rebuking his brother,
left the room with Mrs. Edson, but both
returned in a few minutes, when Edson
again turned to Mrs. Pullen and began
to- entreat her to elope with him. Mrs.
Pullen wae> horrified at the suggestion
and, possessed with fear of the man,'
rttn from the room. Edson, however,
seemed to recover his self-possession and
all went into the dining-room again. A
very few moments afterward Mrs. Ed
son, who was weak and trembling from
the ordeal, was assisted to another room
by Dr. Edson. A moment later, accord
ing- to Woods, a furniture man working
near by in the hallway, Edson pulled
a revolver from his pocket and pointing
it at Mrs. Pullen shouted: "You must
go with me. If you don't elope with
me I'll see that you go with me any
way." ". 7'-\' : l'~.
Mrs. Pullen lived with" her husband.
John F. Pillion, an auditor at the Grand
Central station, and her two children,
Trafton, 16 years old, and Mary, 14 years
old.
The Edsons were to break up their
home this morning as a result of an
agreement to sign articles of separation
reached the night previous. The life of
the couple had not been happy. Edson
had been acting in a peculiar manner.
For that reason furniture movers were in
the house packing lip furniture and bric
a-brac.
These are believed to be the "personals"
referred to. Dr. Peters of St. Michael's
Church, who knew the dead man well.
Is emphatic in his declarations that none
but the most honorable relations existed
between Edson and Mrs. Pullen. She
was, he said, Edson's "friend and ad
viser."
Fannieâ I am loyal and true; cannot go till
I see you; trust John; he will tell you where
I am; with love.
The following, evidently a reply to the
foregoing, appeared this morning:
The following "personal" was published
in a morning newspaper yesterday:

ANSWERS "PERSONAL."
NEW YORK, Sept 2.â Henry Townsend
Edson, s<5n of former Mayor "of New York
Franklin Edaon, at bis apartments at 292
West Ninety-second street, to-day shot
and Instantly killed Mrs. Fannie Pullen of
373 West End avenue, and then shot and
killed himself. The murder and suicide
appear to Â¦ have been premeditated and
followed a dramatic scene. In which Ed
son called upon Mrs. Pullen, a close and
honored friend of his wife and family, to
desert her husband and children and fly
with him to another State. Mrs. Pullen, a
very handsome woman, Is said to have .
been the daughter of a United States i
naval officer.
The double tragedy brought to the Bur
face the fact that Edson, who was comp
troller ot St. Michael's Protestant' Epis
copal Church, had been suspected of mis
appropriating funds "belonging to the
parish, and that expert accountants were
at work on his accounts. It was also de
clared by those related to the family
that Edson was financially distressed on
account of Wall street speculations.
Whatever may "have been the precise '
cause of the tragedy members of the Ed
son family insist that the man was in
sane. There were many indications that
Edson was madly in love with Mrs. Pul
len. On the body of the man was found
the following letter:
Mrs. Pullen â Darling: Trust John implicit
ly. He will always bo a gobetween and faith
ful. I know him thoroughly. He will tell
you where I am waiting for you. to see your
sweet face once more before I go. . I am go
ing far, far away, but will die true to you,
no matter how longr I live. I shall lead a new
life, and an honest one. and If I can ever
come back to you with my past cleaned up,
I will, dearest.' Oh. my God, let me see and
speak to you once more before I go. I can
not go until you do. I hop* and pray that
you put in to-day's (September 1) personal.
Anyway. I answered it in to-morrow's. I hope
you see It. I 'cannot sleep. I can only pray
and pray that you will come to me "once more.
Surely you will, after all y.ou have been' to
me for the past ten years. You do love me,
darling; I know you do. Come to me onco
more, darling, if only to ( say good-by. I
Bball wait here until you come, no matter how
long. John will tell you my hotel name. Aak

McLellan manslaughter case was com
pleted and submitted to. the jury late
this afternoon and after two and a half
hours' deliberation a verdict of "Not
guilty" was returned. The District At

The motion was granted.
The case was dismissed yesterday as to
the defendant, Brismo Martine, the man
who fired the shot that killed the boy
La Palme, in order that he might be
made a witness for the prosecution. Mar
tine then testified that the rifle was given
him by Howard at the direction of
George McLellan and that the latter or
dered him to shoot in the direction ot
four boys on the marsh.

the stand in his own defense. He denied
absolutely the story as told by Martine
and denied saying a word to Martine
about shooting except that when he saw
a bullet strike in the vicinity of the boys
he ordered him to cease firing. After giv
ing the order Martine firea two more
shots, one of which killed La Palme. In
this George corroborated the testimony
given. by. his brother Howard.
Grace and Mary McLellan, sisters of
George, testified that Martine was the
man who called for the rifle and that the
defendant did not order him to use it.

LOSES HIS JOB
AT SAN QUENTIN
There have been several efforts made to divide this party. There
have been some well meaning individuals who thought that the Union
Labor party represented by this convention was not to be perpetuated
and that probably it would be better to fuse with one of the old parties.
(Cries of No! No!) Our slogan at the last primaries was to the ef
fect that we advocated putting into the field purely a Union Labor
party ticket, having on its list union labor men representing the
Mr. Chalnrjan and Members of the Convention: I did not come
prepared to address you this evening, nor did I expect to be called
upon. I wish to say first of all, and I say it without any flattery
whatsoever, that this body of men assembled here la one of the finest
we have ever had in the history of San Francisco, and a good rep
resentation of what the Union Labor Party should be. (Applause.)
The earnestness and the dispatch with which you have entered
upon and carried out the work this evening shows a desire on your
part to go right through with the go.od work that was commenced two
years ago. And it also augurs well for the future of the Union Labor
party in San Francisco, when union men, representing the different
trades and the districts, come together in a body like this and ex
hibit such a determination of purpose, and I feel sure that to-morrow
morning, when this evening's proceedings are heralded forth, thera
will be no doubt in the minds of anybody that the Union Labor
party is here to stay; that the Union Labor party is here to be reck
oned with; that the Union Labor party will at the next election
prove its supremacy, as it did two years ago. at the polls. (Applause.)
. ed with a tremendous ovation. The hall echoed with the
shouts of his partisans and It was some time before he was
able to speak. When quiet was obtained Mayor Schmitz
spoke as follows: \
THERE was a unanimous request from the delegates that
Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz address the convention. The
Union Labor party's standard bearer at the coming elec
tion arose and as he stepped forward to speak was greet-
OFFICERS MAKE
A BIG CAPTURE
wage-earners of Sap Franciscoâ representing that large class of which
there are over 40.000 men and realizing: that they should have proper
representation. There have been 'Individuals who thought that this
body which is elected and represented here to-night was not Inter
ested in the perpetuation of that party, but I am glad to see the
chairman and ' the secretary of the old County Committee calling this
convention to order to-nlsht.
Whatever fighting we have had In the past must all be wiped out
now and forgotten. We must be as we always say In our unions, "One
for all and all for one," and not allow any difference" to divide us.
(Applause.) And as a union labor man â as the standard bearer of
the first Union Labor party In San Francisco â I say to-night that I am
proud to see that feeling exhibited. I am proud to see those who
were on the other side, those who were seemingly so much against us
that they could not be brough^over again â voluntarily say, we have
had our fight, we have lost and now we must come together and as
an undivided body go forth and win a great Victory at the coming elec
tion. (Applause.)
Keep up your enthusiasm, gentlemen. Go forward In the same
manner that you have started out, but be sure of one thing, and that
Is, be careful In the selection of your nominees. Be careful to place
men on your ticket who will command the respect of the entire com
munity and who unhesitatingly stand for your principles, otherwise
the Union Labor party will not be successful. Do not be satisfied to
elÂ«ct but two candidates, but -try to elect the entire ticket, because
the great body of tlie pepole are with you. (Great applause.)
I want to thank you for the kind support you have ever given
me. I want to thank you for the kind reception accorded me here this
evening and I want to assure you that as In the past as you will
find me now, ever at my post of duty, ever ready and willing to forget
all differences that huve existed between me and those who have been
my best friends In the past, and with the desire to further the Inter
ests of this party and the det>lre to do something In a practical way
that will encourage and benefit the wage-earners of San Francisco.

GIVE VOTE OF THANKS.
A vote of thanks was accorded Gus
Harders and George Berger for calling the
convention to order. They were the head
and front of the county committee, which
was bitterly opposed to Mayor Schmitz
before the primary election. Both men
thanked the delegates for their kindly act
and were applauded. This means that the
hatchet has been buried and Schmitz will
receive the. support of both factions of the
Labor party.
A recess was taken in order to give the
various committees an opportunity to or
ganize. Upon reconvening the committees
made their reports. The credentials com
mittee announced that the certified list
of the Registrar was accepted as the roll

adopted.
The committee on organization reported
progress, as did also the committee on

OPENS CONVENTION.
Schmltt. The storm of applause
Â¦which h:J3ed the Mayor's Introduction to
tho cCHventJon frightened the followers
of Michael Casey. Undeniably the Mayor
possesses somo rare Qualities of political
leadership. He Is ready and fluent in sup
portlns Democratic nominees for Con
gress, He is affable and brilliant In the
indorsement of Republican principles at
Republican gatherings and he Is quite
eloquent and Impassioned in his addresses
to Union I^ibor party audiences. The
convention which he addressed last night
is corsposed chiefly of active and intelli
gent young rr.ei: who were chosen at the
recent primary election as representatives
of the Ewell-Aubertir.e-.Parry faction of
the Union Labcr party. They dispatched
the routine business of the evening with
celerity. The smoothness of the work
caused the politicians to admire the skill
and sagacity of the chler programmer.
I< is probable that the delegates to-night
will a-dopt a platform of principles and
place Mayor Schmitz at the head of their

In the prevailing commercialism of the

INTEKNATIONAL UNION
HAS NOT GIVEN SANCTION
Telephone Linemen's Strike Is With
out the Authority of the Gov
erning Body.
SAN JOSE, Sept.' 2.â The telephone line
men's strike now on along the Pacific
Coast has not the sanction of the Inter
national Union of Electric Workers.
Word to this effect was received to-day
by Secretary Magulre of the San Jose
union. The local union had appealed to
the International for power to settle the
differences in their district -v..thout_con
ferring with the "Western conference.
Officials of the international union state
they have never received official notice
of the strike, have never been consulted
in reference to the strike and haVe not
sanctioned it. It is also stated that the
International does not recognize the West
ern conference, which ordered the strike.
Â¦ The local union is told that the linemen
must settle the strike among themselves,
and the San Joseans are told that as far
as the local union returning to work, In
doing so it is not jeopardizing itself with
'the international. Â¦ â¢
â¢ This decision, it Is thought, will have
some bearing with the district unions.
The San Jose union went out in the strike
six weeks ago, but nearly three weeks
ago the men returned/to wcrk. Monday
last they again walked out pending in
structions from the international union.
Just what action the San Jose union will
now take is not known, but it is believed
that the men will again return to work.

KANSAS CITY, Sept 2.â The | Western
cattlemen who propose to build a pack
ing-house , of their own held a meeting
here to-day and agreed upon artlclaB of
Incorporation for a packing company.
The, articles will be filed In Arizona, be
cause the lawyers say they can get great
er privileges there than - elsewhere.
As explained by C. E. Martin, secretary
of the National Livestock Association,
the purpose is not so much to fight the
packing-houses now In existence as to
establish competition and make the pack
ers pay a reasonable price for cattle.
"We want enough for our beef to en
courage farmers to continue In the busi
ness," Mr. Martin explained to-day.
When the new company i3 formed there
will be a sort of voting trust organized
to handle a controlling portion of the
stock. The intention is to have 51 per
cent placed In the hands of trustees and
trustees' certificates issued instead^ of
stock certificates. The cattlemen say
they can raise the money to buy tire
stock among themselves, although it will
be put upon the market and any one may
buy. The voting trust Is to keep the
property out of the hands of the big
packers. The talk to-day is that about
$500,000 stock will be issued at first to
build the plant on the Missouri River.
Later, if this plant shall succeed, another
will be built, probably at Fort Worth,
and more stock sold. The stockmen think
that some day the Oriental trade and the
growth of the livestock industry near the
Pacific Coast will Justify them building a
third packing-house somewhere In Cali
fornia. .
Ranchmen and feeders who are expect
ed to be named among the incorporators
are E. S. Gosney of Arizona, H. A. Jas
tro of California, Frank Benton of Colo
rado, R. R. Selway of Wyoming, J. L.
Smith- of Utah, F. J. Hagenbarth of
Idaho, and directors from Missouri, Ivan
sas and Texas, who are yet to be select
ed. G. W. Gllck of Atchison," former

Vlted to represent the Kansas interests.

THE SAN - FEANCISOO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3; 1903.
Ringllng Brothers offer a novelty this
year In a dramatic spectacle called "Je
rusalem and' the Crusades." ' They have
dipped Into theatrical formulas to make
this production different from all others
shown under circus canvas and to make
It the more telling. For Instance, the
equipments of a theater stage, such as
scenic drops, set property pieces, border
lights, calciums and other effects of the
atric use, have been adopted. This Is
new. The pageant and the ballet have
been seen before, but this Is the first
time an effort has been made to tell a
dramatic story with the scenic surround
ings of a theater. There are 1200 charac
ters In this spectacle, Including 200 chor
isters and 200 dancing girls. Two thou
sand costumes of costly texture and his
toric accuracy are employed. Altogether
It has been brilliantly effective as a de
parture from circus conventions and Is a
pleasing prelude to the unfolding of the
circus programme proper.
There are no mediocre numbers in the
ring performances. The list includes
about 300 acts. Many of, the artists ap
pear here for the first time. Among
these are the Dollard troupe, the Fortune
Brothers, the Rlos, the Alvo trio and the

"My husband and I formerly lived in
San Francisco and I was there visiting
in June. On the evening of the 14th I
went to Bowers' home to call, having
known them intimately. After I had
been there a little while Lervey came in
and then went out and got some beer.
Mr. Bowers came home about 9 o'clock
and did not say anything to Lcrvey, but
just looked at him. Mrs. Bowers said
to me, 'Introduce your friend.' I did not
remember hia name and Lervey spoke it.
Bowers said very crossly: *Ye3, I have
heard of you before,* but never offered
to assault him.
"About a week afterward I went, there
again, hearing that Bowers was sick. He
said he was poisoned and that it was
from eating ham which Mrs. Bowers had
purchased. Ho vomited and she told me
that she vomited, too, and then he said
he had terrible pains all over him."

Mrs. McCallum said:
Asked regarding the Presidential possi

"In my own State there is a bit of agi

the next Governor. When I left Chicago
there had been no definite turn in affairs
and no one was certain who would be the
choice of the Republican party."_
Discussing the canal matter, in so far

Senator said that the South American re

purposes to do. If she opposes the canal
project he thinks that she will stand in

the greater sufferer. Continuing, he said:
"The canal should be built for the ben

will permit small obstacles to stand in
the way of carrying out the plans for the

LABOR AND ADMISSION DAYS.
It is expected that the Duncans Mill
Lumber Company will donate a part of the
lumber to be used in construction. The
Rev. Mr. Parker has already received
some financial aid from Episcopalians of
the Northern Diocese of California, who
have no special Interest in Monte Rio,
but who favor the extension of the church
influence, and it is believed other lay
members will lend their aid when the
project becomes known.
It is proposed to raise $1000 for the
church edifice and later on to erect a neat
parsonage. The services will be conduct
ed by a missionary of the diocese of
which the Right Rev. William H. More
land is Bishop. Rev. C. A. Doane of this
city has a cottage in the neighboring vil
lage of Camp Meeker and held services
there during last summer.
St. Dorothy's Rest for the care of con
valescent children at Camp Meeker is
supported by charitable Episcopalians on
a non-sectarian policy as far as the ben
eficiaries are concerned.
The land company offered a site for the
proposed church edifice at the corner of
Middle way and Myrtle lane, while one
of the officials who owns a cottage at
Monte Rio tendered a cash donation to
the building fund. It is expected that
many of the cottagers will also contrib
ute to the fund. Charles F. Carr, propri
etor of the Hotel Monte Rio, recently en
tertained Rev. Mr. Parker and other
ministers of , the church, who visited
Monte Rio, and offered them a substantial
cash donation.
Episcopalians Plan to Erect Sacred J
Edifice and Strong Support j
Has Been Given.
The Episcopalians are planning to erect â¢
a house /jf worship at the new cottage vll- ;
lage of Monte Rio Park on the Russian !
River In the mountains of the western j
part of Soncma County. The Rev. O. ;
Parker, archdeacon of Sacramento, was j
a visitor in San Francisco yesterday In j
the" interests of the new project. He in- :

Railroad and land companies, where he Â¦

Young Whltwell Is a. member of a
wealthy family In New York, and no ex
pense was spared to make his life agree
able at college. Mr. Bonestell./ the grand
father, is one of the partners in the firm
of Bonestell. Richardson & Co.
"The young man is 22 years old and a
giant for his age. He was a member qt
the varsity crew at Harvard and was
prominent in ail athletics. One of the
very sad features of the case Is that his
father died in New York only two weeks
after his disappearance.
"I to-day received telegrams from Mrs.
Whitwell, who had been informed of the
Austin story, and I will co-operate with
her at once to send word to her son. She
has been greatly distressed over his mys
terious absence and is delighted to feel
that he is safe and may soon return to
her."
The discovery of the whereabouts of W.
S. Whltwell, the long missing Harvard
University student, who is now enjoying
the dubious luxury of cowpunching on a
Texas ranch, as was reported by tele
graph from Austin. Tex., in The Call yes
terday, has virtually brought to a plea
surable end the tireless and exasperating
ly ineffectual search made by, the boy's
mother and his other relatives since last
February.
Mrs. Whltwell, the mother, who resides
in New York, and L. H. Bonestell of this
city, the grandfather of the truant col
legian, had encountered so many ob
stacles and been disappointed so frequent
ly In their efforts to trace the young man,
that there seemed not the remotest
chance of success. Friends of the family
in the Southwest rendered them every
possible assistance and. a few had even
seen "Scolly" Whltwell in Texas some
months ago, but beyond the accumulation
of interesting but useless scraps of infor
mation, their work was profitless.
When the news of the location of Whit
well on a ranch thirty miles from San
Antonio appeared yesterday, Mr. Bone-
Btell Immediately made arrangements to
place himself in communication with his
grandson. Telegrams were sent to Aus
tin and doubtless a courier is now on hla
way to the place where Whitwell is em
ployed as a cowboy.
"This is the flrst satisfactory news we
have had in seven months," said Mr.
Bonestell yesterday. Since February 28
we have searched over half the continent
for the boy. He disappeared from, Cam
bridge on that date and we have not had
a word from him since. Some time pre
viously he had spent a year in Germany
and he said he would make that time up
at 'Harvard by hard study. I am con
vinced that he studied too bard and the
impulse seized him to get away from the
worry of his school work.
"One of his classmates saw him in New
York a few days after he left college, and
said he thought the boy might go to
Texas. The story of his disappearance
was later, read by Thomas Blodgett at
Waco, and he wrote to Mrs. Whitwell.
telling her that he believed he had seen
my grandson there. ]
"I was in New York at the time and
on my way out here 1 stopped at Waco
and heard that the boy was on the Co
burn ranch near Sin Antonio. I could
not locate him there, however, and was
told afterward that he had come to CaJl
fornia. This Call dispatch would seem to
substantiate that statement, for it says
that three weeks ago be returned to

Arsenic is not easily soluble, but Pro
fessor Morgan says that when a man
dies from arsenical poison and a consid
erable quantity remains in the victim's
stomach It is evidence that the dose must
ha\*e been a large one. It is the dissolved
arsenic circulating with the blood that
does the damage. Professor3 Green and
Professor Green and Chemist Morgan,
his assistant, have completed their analy
sis of the contents of the dead man's
stomach. They found two and a fraction
grains of free arsenic of the common
white crystal variety. There were no
traces of other poisons. Two grains of
arsenic is said to be a fatal dose, v
COMPLETE ANALYSIS.
John Schnoor of 366 Clementina street
came forward with the statement yester
day that on the morning after the death
of. the bridge builder he started for the
corner grocery at 5:30 o'clocn and saw
Mrs. Bowers, clad in her night clothes,
letting Lervey out of the door. As soon
as the latter observed that he was seen
he ran swiftly around the corner and up
Fifth street. This Is evidence that Lervey
and Mrs. Bowers both lied In their pre
vious statements to the police that they
sat up all night. Mrs. Magnan of 368
Clementina street Is said to have seen the
same occurrence.
Attorney Vaughn of Portland, Or., who
Is directing the defense, sa>'3 that he is
certain that his clients did not commit
the murder and that the truth will come
out during the progress of the prospec
tive trial. He has told the women not to
talk and they refuse to answer any
more questions.
Lervey when seen yesterday denied
that he had had trouble with Bowers
when the latter returned from Mare
Island the night before he was taken 111.
He said they were introduced and talked
together pleasantly. Lervey has become
defiant and declines to answer vital ques
tions. Â£
Chief of Police Hunt of Seattle has been
requested by the local authorities to set
a comprehensive statement from Mrs.
Dcedie McCallum of that city, who was a
close friend of Mrs. Bowers.Xand who
was present in the sick room on various
occasions.
Cunningham will be interrogated again
severely as soon as possible. It Is ar
gued, now the facts in the case have be
come known, that Cunningham as the
consort of Mrs. Sutton and the constant
attendant on the dying bridge builder,
ought to know as much of the real cir
cumstances of the case as Patrick Ler
vey, or O'Leary, the lover of Mrs! Bow
ers. The police theory is that Mrs. Sut
ton was to get a share of the $2S00 bank
account for engineering the affair and
that even if Cunningham did not know
that murder was being committed, he
would at least be cognizant of the fact
that his companion was expected to
shortly better her condition financially.
Cunningham will have an opportunity to
tell his story under oath at the Coroner's
inquest at 10 o'clock to-morrow morning.
WILL HAVE TO EXPLAIN.
A police officer saw him sitting on tfte
wall which surrounds Portsmouth square
yesterday afternoon watching for some
one to come from the Hall of Justice,
where Mrs. Sutton is imprisoned. It is
said that he was attempting to communi
cate with the woman through some third
person who is not at present known to
the authorities. He was visibly In a state
of alarm last night and refused to talk
of the Bowers murder. He was formerly
a waiter in the Olympia, where Mrs. Sut
ton was a constant visitor. She was a
notorious character, but was never ar
rsted for vagrancy, so says Police Of
ficer Callandun, whose beat has long be-en
on the lower portion of Eddy street, be
cause the woman declared that she main
tained a lodging-house and it would have
been hard to prove a case against her.
John Cunningham was just as notoriousfy
known as her companion. But to the po
lice he represented that he did not know
much of her and that his sole intttrest in
visiting 320 Clementina street was to as
sist the sick man.
Nothing was said about this watch un
til the fact that it was missing was dis
covered by a Call representative and re
ported to the police. Detective Ryan se
cured it from Cunningham late Tuesday
night. And now the authorities are ask
ing why John Cunningham attempted to
show that he was the closest friend of
the murdered bridge builder instead of ad
mitting his relations with the woman
who has been declared to have been the
person who purchased the arsenic at As
kenasy's drug store. When confronted
with \he statement that he had lived in
Mrs. Button's . apartments Cunningham
replied that the woman was simply his
landlady, which is not deemed likely by
the police. /
ACTIONS ABE SUSPICIONS.
It Is now learned that he has been liv
ing in Mrs. Button's apartments for more
than a year and is eaid by fellow
habitues of the tenderloin to be her con
sort. The people who live near the Bow
ers house on Clementina street say that
Cunningham never visited the place until
the bridge builder was on his death bed
and then in company with Mrs. Sutton.
He gavf\ much assistance in the care of
Bower3. When the latter was dead Cun
ningham, In the role of the grief-stricken
friend, took the murdered man's $140 gold
watch and chain. The story is that Mrs.
Bowers wanted to reward the waiter for
al! his trouble.
John Cunningham, a w/iiter In the
Oberon music hal!, has suddenly become
one of the most prominent figures in the
sensational Bowers murder mystery- His
misrepresentations of hla position in the
horrible affair in his statements to the
police authorities have become known.
Last night the officers were debating the
advisability of taking him into custody.
He will be subpenaed at any rate and
kept under the order of the court. He
is openly accused by the police of know
ing more than he has told.
Mrs. Bowers stated to the Chief of Po
lice immediately after her arrest that
the persons who gave food to the pois
oned bridge builder were herself, Harry
Bowers arS his wife. Mrs. Sutton and
John Cunningham. All of them were sub
jected to a severe examination and their
stories were kept for record.
John Cunningham asserted that he had
been a lifelong friend of Martin Bowers,
that he had but little acquaintance with
the women and that his frequent visits
to 370 Clementina street were for the pur
pose of nursing the sick man. He said
that he had visited the grocery
where the ham was bought for the pur
pose of discovering if there was anything
the matter with the rest of the meat on
the same bone. He visited the house
practically every day and did all he could
to help.

PERSONAL MENTION.
It is so seldom in our politics that a great party
speaking in a State convention singles out some one
man for denunciation,* that it is interesting to note
to what extent the Ohio Democrats singled out Sen
ator, Hanna as the sole object of their antagonism.
The task of sounding the keynote of the campaign
was intrusted to the Hon. G. M. Saltzgaber,
who was introduced as temporary chairman, and who
made the opening address of the convention. In the
course of his speech the orator denounced what he
called "tariff iniquities" and went on to say: "Con
vince the people that you are in earnest and will
carry this one reform into effect, and on that alone
the majority will sweep you into power. Why should
they continue to vote with Mr. Hanna? Nineteen
twentieths of the voters of Ohio are also righteously
opposed to Mr. Hanna's ship subsidy scheme to draw
money from the public treasury and bestow it on
those already rich. Will a majority of the voters
consent that Mr. Hanna shall remain in power to
further schemes by which some are enriche'd at the
expense of the many?"
Judging from the tone of the convention, Demo
cracy sees nothing in politics except Mark â¢ Hanna,
and has no other impulse to activity than a desire
WHEN Tom Johnson won out in the Demo
cratic State convention in Ohio there was a
triumph not only for Bryan's platform, but
for Bryan's latest method of making a political fight.
It appears that the campaign in Ohio is to be made
personal to a degree hitherto unknown in that State,
and just as Bryan now devotes himself mainly to a
fight against Cleveland, so Johnson and his follow
ers are to make their fight mainly against Senator
Hanna.
FIGHTING MARK HANNA.
If reports from various parts of California were
true one might suspect that there are a hundred des
perate convicts at large with murderous and thieving
intent instead of, less than ten. Frightened men and
women are seeing in every strange and passing face
and in every unwonted shadow desperate jailbird,
freed from his cage and bent on crime.
Quite an extensive programme has been arranged
for the six days of bragging and booming. A report
says: "Another Fort Dearborn will be set up in one
of the parks, within and without the counterpart of
the original. Four hundred real Indians will come
from Michigan in their canoes and when the cele
bration begins they will paddle up the river and
camp near the fort, upon which at stated times they
will make sham attacks. Then there will be an al
legorical and industrial parade. With myriad lights
and countless torches a procession of floats will rep
resent, successively, its Indian origin, its early set
tlement, the massacre of its pioneers by the red
men, its great fire and' its World's Fair; while its
commercial progress will be told in a series of tab
leaux and illuminated pictures."
The chief spectacular show of the occasion is to
be a celebration of the great fire. In describing it
the report goes on to say: "Over the great terri
tory devastated by the conflagration the roofs of all
the larger buildings will be arranged for red fire. Sim
ultaneously this combustible powder will be touched
off and a glare that will be -visible for many miles
around will be maintained for two hours. A bomb
display will also be given from the roof of the
O'Leary home on De Koven street to signalize the
spot wliere the cow kicked over the lantern."
Altogether the occasion is going to be a halcyon
and vociferous time. The visitor will not have to
expend any of his money or his energy in painting
the town red, for all that will be done for him by
his Chicago entertainers. All that he will have to do
will be to enjoy himself and every now and then
refer to the coming' exposition at St. Louis as a
prospective side show, ,
CHICAGO is going to do herself proud by cel
brating the centennial of her existence as a
home of white men. The first settlement
dates back to August of a hundred years ago, but
Chicago has postponed the festival until September
26, when she will begin it and continue it for six
days. Just why the postponement was made has
not been stated. Of course Chicago is not getting
to be so slow that she cannot keep up with the al
manac, so it is not probable the delay has been oc
casioned by any\ lack of ability to get ready at the
proper time. Possibly the August weather may have
had something to do with the change of date. Au
gust is a sultry, thirsty time in Chicago even under
the most quiet conditions, and it may be her leading
citizens felt that if a celebration were sprung upon
them at that time the thirst would be too great for
the supply of lake water to quench, and an impor
tation of beer from St. Louis might be rendered nec
essary. Such a fear would, of course, have caused a
postponement of the festival without further debate.
Chicago can do many things, but she cannot revel
with a true joy on beer bearing a St. Louis label.
Toward the close then of this month, at a time
when the weather is not utterly horrid, Chicago will
shoot rockets at the stars, burn red lights on the
tops of her skyscrapers, set her streets blazing with
e' .ctric lights, adorn her stockyards, slaughter-houses
and university with gay bunting, and be ready to blow
her horn of jubilation over the growth she made
during the hundred years that have passed since
the first white man settled there. because he could not
get away, having neither energy to go farther west
nor money to return east.
CHICAGO'S CENTENNIAL.
An Oakland murderer, self-confessed, noncha
lantly chewed gum the other day during the progress
of his trial. He probably knows better than any one
else that in the trial for his life nothing very serious
h at stake.
Taken as a whole, the Russian situation is by no
means, encouraging to those who desire the main
tenance of peace in that part of the world, and it
is clear that a new control is needed in the imperial
council. Whether the promotion of Witte means
that he is to have full power to act in dexling with the
crisis, or whether it means . that a new man is to
have charge, remains to be seen. -The one thing
indifputable is that it is high time for some one to
change the imjsrial â¢programme, v
GON'CERNING the meaning of the Czar's
promotion of M. .Wine from the position of
Minister of. Finance to that of President of
the Council authorities diner. Nominally the promo
tion places, him at the head of the imperial ministry,
but: thtre; is such a-thing as a presidency that has
very little, power and it may be that Witte has been
â¢pvtTl-aTf office of that kind for the purpose of de
priving h'itn of. his "former authority.
For some years past- the distinguished Russian has
â¢enjoyed*, a high. repute in western Europe and in the
.United States: He; has been credited with the au
thorship of most of the great policies of finance,
social 'reform ar.d internal development which have
keen 'undertaken, in Russia since he entered the min
istry/ Moreover, his work has been regarded as
"fcighly successful and mere than one panegyric has
i>een' pronounced upon -the statesman who could
achieve such marvels in ?uch a land.
.'While the tide of western admiration was flowing
in, his. favor,, little attention was given to criticisms
of his work and of his methods. Such reports of
antagonism as came from Russia were set down
as evidences of the opposition of a barbaric conser
vatism to a progressive statesman. Of late, how
ever, ihere has been a more serious study of the
-Russian situation by European economists, and the
fesul'u have been by no means favorable to Witte's
rej>iitat:on as a successful minister; for the showing
of.thc crnpire either from a financial or a sociological
pptnf of view is one of impending danger.
.Recently Bjoernson, the Norwegian statesman and
mar. of Letters, made an analysis of the financial sit
uatioh in Russia and pointed out that the public debt
has reached the sum of $3,450,000,000. Of this $1,
Â¦.7.3 j. 400, 000 was placed at home and $855,600,000
abroad In the past' four years Russia has borrowed
abroad Svoo.ooo.ooo' and this does not include the
loins for railways.. Taxes have increased to a
degree. of terrible exaction, in the same period. Bjoern
i>on,say$;' "Expenditures are steadily increasing, but
.the receipts can no longer keep pace with them. A
part of the railway system pays no dividends; does
not even, pay for: its running. Taxes have reached
their, ultimate limit. This* last point is confirmed by
Wit.te.iri his report to the imperial council."
Bad as is the financial condition, of the empire it
is- by na means the worst feature of the situation.
The- industrial and social conditions are even more
threatening than the menace of imperial bankruptcj-.
P.rofessbr Ernest Tixbouricch, who has made a long
sojourn- in Russia and a careful study of the people,
.has- recently startled Europe by the gloomy picture
which he presents of the Russian situation as a whole,
and by his delineation of the portentous signs of a
coming revolution or insurrection that may involve
'.sjl. eastern Europe in strife and disaster. Other au
thorities confirm the report of Tarbouriech. It is
ftated that at the present time in South Russia alone
.there are upward of 500,000 men on a strike, and so
jbtesse is the popular interest in the struggle that the
government for the first time in recent history has
beCa forced to permit the press to publish reports
of the. event and keep the public informed of the
developments in the various districts where the
; strikes -prevail.
A Berlin report of recent date says the strikes are
merely a covering for a social revolt of. enormous
proportions/which, starting in the Caucasus, has
spread rapidly in every direction. The cause of the
outbreak is s?id 'to have been a racial antagonism
among the people of the Caucasus excited by the
efforts of the. government to "Russianize" them. The
closing of Armenian schools is reported to have de
prived 20,000 children of their opportunities to ob
tain an- education in their native language, and other
races have been as badly treated as the Armenians.
It will be remembered that while the "Russification"
of the southern tribes has been enforced in that
drastic way, a similar policy has been applied with an
equal barbarity in Finland, so that the extreme north
of "the empire is almost as badly disturbed as the
THE - CRISIS IN RUSSIA.
IT turns out that the American vice-consul at Bei
rut was not murdered. The American Minis
ter at Constantinople misinformed his Govern
ment. The vice-consul himself answers an official
inquiry that he is "fit as a fiddle." Just what that
implies in diplomacy is for the experts of the State
Department to say. It would seem proper that he
be sent elsewhere to display his violincular fitness,
since it is a quite serious matter to mislead a govern
ment into making a costly naval demonstration
against a friendly power.
Concurrently with the report of the vice-consul's
assassination was a harrowing tale of crime against
the American college at Harput. That college is a
potent storm center. Many members of its faculty
are Armenians who are naturalized Americans. They
carry into their use of that missionary school their
violent racial and religious prejudice against the
Turks, and, sheltered by our flag, act in a way that
would not occur to native Americans.
When the clerical cry went up for the slaughter
of the Turks and their expulsion from Europe, it
was supposed that Harput had been or was about to
be put to the torch. The American Missionary As
sociation arranged for a â¢ cdnference with Secretary
Hay to secure another demonstration at Harput.
Now it turns out that the shot supposed to be in

While this phase of the question, in respect to
water, may be abridged in its seeming importance,
because the non-users are in a minority, the tax
ation of one man only for a benefit he does not share,
nor need to share, is a violation of his rights, which,
tolerated, may in other matters be indefinitely ex
tended so that large masses of taxpayers may be in
volved in confiscation. In the case of the Geary
street road there is no such mitigation. The large
majority are to be taxed for the benefit of a small
minority. The independence of our people began in
a protest against taxation without representation. Is
not taxation without benefit, or the possibility of
benefit, as bad, or worse?
Public ownership and administration of utilities was
not dreamed of by the statesmen who founded our
system and was left out of the calculations of those
who originated or adapted our scheme of municipal
government. Where it has long existed it is im
possible to ascertain its merits or its demerits be
cause its administration is merged so chaotically with
the purely political purposes of government that its
unraveling is the despair of accountants and actu
aries. Only one thing is known. Everywhere there
is extravagance and waste, which, so far as they are
measurable, prove that they equal corporate profits
in similar lines of business. When the cause of waste
is sought, the wisest advocates of public ownership
fc>in its wisest opponents in admitting that it lies
r.i separating the bonds for public plants and the
cost of their administration from the plants them
selves.
Recent investigations show that public utilities un
der city ownership are more costly than under pri
vate ownership. Chicago .runs a municipal electric
light plant A recent investigation by the city's ex
pert accountant discloses these facts: That during
the whole period of city ownership from 1888 to 1900
the average annual cost per arc light was $142 18, and
in one year it was $266 44. The private company
which supplies Cleveland charged only $94 80 per arc
light. The apparent cost per arc light supplied by
the public plant in Detroit is $78, but sinking fund,
interest and expenses charged off to the general fund
bring the cost up to ?oo 72 as -shown by the sifting
of the accounts by experts.
It will be seen that the taxpayer of Detroit was
deceived when told that his light was costing him the
lesser sum. That deception was made possible by
separating debt, interest and expense from the plant
and putting them upon the general fund. Surely
these experiences, which are common to the history
of public plants in every large city in the Union,
should teach and exhort this city and Oakland to
begin the public utility policy in the right way, which
is the business way.
Besides this there is a question of confiscatory tax
ation involved. Why should property remote from
the Geary street road be taxed to acquire and run
it as a public enterprise when it has no share in its
benefits and no use of the public convenience which
it supplies? ' Why should all the taxpayers south
of Market have their tax burden, already heavy, in
creased to supply those who live on the Geary street
road the means of transportation? Are the Geary
street people doing anything for those who live and
pay taxes south of Market street? No, they in no
way reciprocate, nor propose to reciprocate. So in
Oakland there is a very large number of taxpayers
who have their own water supply. The private water
company in that city does not reach them. It can
not charge them anything. They are beyond its
control. If citv water bonds are based upon the
plant to be created by them these non-users will con
th.ue to be independent, but if the bonds are a lien
upon the city every taxpayer must contribute whether
he is a user or a non-user.
I * I "Â»HE charter of this city provides that it may go
I into various branches of business by the pur
Â¦*â¢ chase or creation of public utilities. That term
, had in the beginning a definite and restricted mean
ing, but its meaning is now indefinitely extended. In
the experience of New Zealand it is taken to mean
public ownership of lands and the founding and ad
ministration of life insurance, the guarantee of work
and wages with the state as an employer, and a long
list of other things that were once considered far
beyond the purpose of government.
We are just entering upon a policy that elsewhere
has worked out to disuse or exhaustion. New Zea
land has borrowed money on her general credit for
the pushing of her business enterprises and is in
such a condition that failures and deficits are not
chargeable to the business in which they occur, but
pass on to the state and burden the general credit
until public creditors are clamoring for their money
or are protesting against further impairment of their
security. %

to down him. Of course, if the issue be made upon
the policies of protection to American industry, both
on land and, on the sea, Senator Hanna will hardly
need to take the stump, for the people of Ohio have
time and again declared themselves in favor of both
the one and the other. It is, perhaps, for that rea
son the Democratic campaigners have decided to
make the fight this year not so much against those
policies as against the personality of a man whose
successes in business and in politics may be sup
posed to have caused enmities and envies that will
incline a good many discontented people to vote
agaipst him just for spite's sake.
Whatever may be the differences of opinion con
cerning the expediency of making a personal fight
against Senator Hanna, it will be admitted by all that
such a fight is very small politics. With Bryan de
nouncing Cleveland as a "bunko steerer" and Tom
Johnson denouncing Hanna as the "heavy villain"
of American life, it is not strange the conservative
Democrats have resolved to save their party from
such leaders at the next national convention, or
leave it forever.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 3, 1903.

Me-ows of a Kitty;
' I "* HAT line above caught and chained your attention t& this article.*
I didn't it? Why? Not merely because it was startling or facetious.
â¢*Â¦ unusual or bizarre, but because â because it wasÂ» about a CAT.
That might seem an utterly absurd reason, now that it is brought home
to you so boldly, but it isn't It. is the most natural reason in the world
because â well â because everybody is interested in cats, particularly; those .
who hate them most. Why? That is one of the mysteries of the ages,
that has never bâ¬en explained. Like the riddle of the sphinx, it bids! fair
to be an eternal mystery, because like the sphinx a cat â any old catâ
will attract and hold your interest as nothing else can, cvenin ipite of
yourself. Â¦ .Â¦""'"
Through all the ages, in various countries/ cats have been" yen-*
erated as a diety. Deep in its nature is the spirit of the.unfathQnjible.
Take notice for yourself, no matter how fond you may be of yo;ur own
household tabby, there are times when it creeps into your presence with
an air of the uncanny in every sly, snake-like movement Again. brus.h
its shiny coat in the dark and every hair will emit an electric* spark. â¢ In
all the vast literary lore that clusters about it. it stands with equal adapt-
ibility for truth and falsehood. Purring lazily in the chimney corner it'
is the very embodiment of eternal calm and irreproachable dignity.
And yet how quick a fiendish metamorphosis. may be wrought No mat-
ter how tame, it can never be quite trusted. . Like half truths., it is <oo-^
tinually engaged in disarming suspicion, as for instance: ; â¢ â¢ .
"All the world loves a lover except the girl he is. chasing." :" .; â¢
"Love controls the matrimonial market, but money ;often cor-
ners it" â¢â¢;'.Â¦'. 'Â¦Â¦ .' . : . : . : ' ' ."
- 4 "A man who boasts of his morality needs watching." . -.'Â¦( . :
"Love is often" a poor paying hot-air investment." .. : â¢ â¢â¢ >" .. â¢
"Memory is both the hope and despair of life.** . â¢ . r â¢ .'* " .;
However, that is quite enough to illustrate the point in question,
namely the mystery and attractiveness of cats. If you want to hear,
moreâ and of course you doâ any time, all the timeâ you will see the
big picture of the particular feline about which the above is written Â«nd
read the strange article that goes therewith in the next -Sunday Ca}l. *
Even more fascinating arc the two pages of ''Half-Hour Storiette's."
"In the Mystic Wake- of the Red Canoe is one that you will rea.d with
distinct pleasure, nor will you be able to overlook "The -Wild Flight "of
Cupid and the Comet." Odd titles, eh? Yes. Bat they're both attairjt..
exciting stories. And there are others, you may. be *sure. Â¦'Tatters."
"Elsie's Gray Hat." "A Modern Pandora." "Finding of H-ef "* "Victims
of a Recoil." "Fables for the Foolish," "Aphorisms From '.the- : Silver
Poppy," "Fads and Phrases." "The Oracle of Mulberry Center/' â¢ ete.
These are not only unusual titles, but each is at the- top- of a. clever,
thrilling, new and novel story. You'll read every one of them, -anti rnore t '
because there is much more to read. Take note further. .' â¢' - :
There is a full-page story by Josephine Dodge Daskam. who", as every- .
body knows, won vast fame for her stories about childrenâ not -merely
â¢ namby-pamby child stories, but real flesh and blood, children, Â¦ Just
watch for "Ardeha in Arcadia" if you don't know the sort that Miss.
Daskam writes about. You'll laugh until your sides ache. * â¢. .
Then there is "Old John Gorgon Graham's Alphabet." This is t!ie
most original creation ever penned. Will you laugh? Yes. And do"
some serious thinking: besides long before you get down to X, Y, Z.
And then there is the third installment of "Brewster's Millions." .
which tells what that sorely perplexed but dead game young man didto
make up for lost time after his long, serious illness to spendâ actually
spend â not dissipate^ â his uncle's million in one short year to inherit six
more. He rushed off to the Mediterranean, .ndâ well just get The Sunday
Call and read for yourself. It is an installment that makes a complete-
story in itself. You don't have to know what went before to be fasci-
nated, enthralled. -""â¢.'.-. . *
Then there is a Sea Monster that gobbled forty-five tons at one

At a meeting of the Sunset Improve
ment Club, held on Wednesday evening,
a suggestion was offered by President
Edward Ewald, which- was accepted by
the club, to the effect that instead of
voting for a bond issue, as is proposed,
amendments to the charter would be an
easier way of securing the necessary
funds for city improvements. In the sug
gestion offered President Ewald recom
mends that a slight increase on the dollar
limit be added yearly until the necessary
improvements are accomplished. Particu
lar stress is laid on the need of keeping
the public streets and "Sidewalks in good
condition and also adopting a system of
general sewerage.

For Benefit of St. ' Catherine's.
I wish to suggest a method, and I sincerely
believe the only method by which we will ever
get our share of the commerce of South Amer
ican and South African countries and of the
Islands lying south of the equator. The policy
which resulted In creating? the commerce of
the Pacific slope was subsidizing lines of com
munication with the Pacific slope. When the
first transcontinental lines of railway were
built there was not sufficient commerce to pay
operating expenses, to say nothing of dividends
on Investments. Few business men and fewer
politicians objected to government aid to trans
continental lines during the development period
ot the commerce along these lines. These rail
ways need no assistance now. No business
man objects to Government aid to the com
merce of our navigable rivers, and no political
party objects to large expenditures of non-nav
igable streams Improvements to rivers and
harbors Is subsidy to the commerce of rivers
and harbors. If we ever secure the trade of
the countries to which I have referred, we
will first secure regular lines of communication
with these countries, and If we ever secure
these lines assistance must be afforded. Who
of you, owning a steamship, would divert It
from participation in trans-Atlanft commerce
where there is much to be done, and send It
on regular trips to countries where we have
little or no commerce?
Do not misunderstand me. I am not mourn
ing the defeat of any ship subsidy bill, but I
shall mourn exceedingly the defeat of a bill,
if any such shall ever be introduced, which,
if enacted, would insure regular lines of Amer
ican ships, flying the American flag, and carry
ing American merchants and commercial trav
elers with their wares and merchandise, the
product of American labor, into those countries
to which I have referred. Such a bill must
offer special advantages to ships plying be
tween our ports and countries where our trade
is undeveloped.

torium Hotel by the National- Association
of Merchants and Travelers. Lyman J.
Gage addressed the association on the
same subject Just before his retirement
from the Treasury Department and great
interest was attached to tho speech to
night of the present Secretary. In his
discussion of the financial question Secre
tary Shaw declared that what was need
ed was not an elastic dollar, but some
provisions by which, automatically, the
aggregate volume of dollars should in
crease whenever and wherever more dol
lars were needed and would as promptly
retire when not needed. He said in part:
TO those who are comparing 1903 with 1893,
and who think history likely to repeat
Itself every ten years, permit the suggestion
of a few radical differences In conditions. , Ten
years ago, whether wisely or unwisely, wheth
er with or without foundation In fact or rea
son, a very large number, and of that number
many close students of commercial and indus
trial conditions, believed our then financial
system not only unsafe, but absolutely vicious.
At least four kinds of money â United States
notes, treasury notes, silver dollars and silver
certificates â were believed to be dangerously
near depreciation. Grave doubts existed, and
were freely expressed, whether the Secretary of
the Treasury could maintain the parity of these
forms of money if he chose, and equally grave
doubts existed as to the wisdom of attempting
to maintain their parity. Aye, a very respect
able number of very good people, and a very re
spectable portion of a very good public press,
openly advocated the redemption of greenbacks
In silver and the refusal to exchange gold for
any form of money except gold certificates.
No euch doubt or desire now exists. By ex
press statute it has become the duty of the
Secretary of the Treasury to maintain the
parity with gold of all forms of money coined
or issued by the Government, and express
authority 1b given to negotiate loans. If neces
sary, for that purpose. *n other words, the
Secretary of the Treasury Is directed to ex
change gold for any and every kind and form
of money coined or issued by the United States,
and to bond the Government to the last limit
of his authority whenever such action is neces
sary to the maintenance of parity. A man is a
fool who sends his money Into hiding now.
It Is true that a very respectable number of
very good people, and in that number I desire
to be classed, believe our financial system,
good as it is, might be Improved by adding an
element of elasticity. I do not think there ex
ists any great number who believe we should
have an inflation. Eight years ago we had
$21 per capita. Now we have certainly more
than $29 and probably nearly $30 per capita.
Conservative business men and conservative
bankers do not generally consider this an in
sufficient normal minimum volume of curren
cy. I repeat, the only criticism now offered
relates to the want of elasticity. Not that a
dollar can be made elastic, but that the vol
ume shall be made responsive to the demands
of business. Of course the term is a misnomer.
Elastic majterial like rubber will expand in
one direction, but it contracts in the oppo
site direction, while the material, the volume,
is neither increased nor diminished. What is
needed Is not an elastic dollar, but some pro
vision by which, automatically, the aggregate
volume of dollars shall Increase whenever and
wherever more dollars are needed, and will as
promptly retire when not needed. â¢ â¢ â¢
The reunion came to ( a close to-night
with a campflre at the People's Church.
Governor Van Zant made an address in
behalf of the State and General Irving
Hale, retiring president of the Army of
the Philippines, responded. Captain Mail
ley also made an address and informal
talks were given by General King. Gen
eral Reeve, Colonel Metcalf and others.
ST. PAUL, Sept. 2.â The day for the
parade of the Army of the Philippines
dawned with cloudy and threatening
skies, and shortly before the hour set for
the start a drizzle of rain began to fall.
Nevertheless the programme waa carried
out and, headed by General C. McC.
Reeve as grand marshal, a column about
3000 strong marched through the down
town streets.
The Society of the Army of the Phil
ippines, under command of Brigadier
General Hale, was the last of the military
bodies In line, but by far the most im
posing. At the head of It rode Generals
Hale and King and Colonel Metcalf. They
marched well and were greeted with
cheers and waving hats all along the line.
At the business session this afternoon
officers were elected as follows:
President, General Charles King, Wisconsin;
first vice president. Colonel J. "W. Pope, Colo
rado; second vice president. Captain C. Locke,
Colorado; third vice president, Captain M.
Shute, St. Paul; fourth vice president. Captain

THISTLES AND DANDBT7FF.
An Interesting- Parallel and a Valuable
Deduction Therefrom.
Cutting: down thistles no more relieves
the land of thistles than does scouring
the scalp cure dandruff. In each case
permanent relief can only come from
eradicating permanently the cause. A
germ that plows up the scalp in search-
ing for the hair root where it saps the
Vitality, causes dandruff, falling hair,
and baldness. If you kill that germ,
you'll have no dandruff but a luxuriant
i suit of hair. Newbro's Herpicide is the
; only hair preparation in the world that
cures dandruff and falling hair by kill-
ing the germ. "Destroy the cause, you
remove the effect." Sold t>y leading drug-

INDOOR MEET
FOR ATH LETES
The veteran James Code set a fast pace
in his match with Percy Murdock.' He
won the first set, but in the next three
everything went Murdock's way.
Clarence Griffin, a promising young
park player, made an excellent showing
against R. N. Whitney. He won the first
set from Whitney and led at 4-0 in the
second. Whitney won an English love
set, taking the next six games straight.
After this the veteran was master of the
situation. Following is the summary:
Men's singles, preliminary roundâ S.C. Gay
ness beat G. K. Bates by default; A. E Bell
beat Clay Gooding. 6-2 6-1 6-2; J. D Mac-
Gavin beat Alexander Deyfuss, 6-3, 6-3, 7-5;
Harry Rolte beat Herbert Schmidt, 2-6. 6-3,
6-4 (withdrew); Xorman Ambrose beat C. Tel
ler by default; James Code beat Marius Hotch-'
kiss by default: Percy Murdock beat Guy Lyt
ton. 8-1. 6-3. 6-1; Paul Jones beat C. Dunlap
by default; A. C. Way beat Miller Hotchkiss
by default; R. N. Whitney beat Clarence Grif
fin. 5-7. 6-4, 0-3, 6-2.

Women's 'singles, semi-final round â Miss Vio
let Sutton beat Miss Myrita Seymour. 6-0, 6-1
Finalâ Miss Florence Sutton beat Miss Vio
let Sutton. 6-3, 6-3.
Harry Rolfe, a youngster of the Cali
fornia Tennis Club, - distinguished him
eelf yesterday. To. the surprise of all he
beat his club mate, Herbert Schmidt. He
then took Norman Ambrose of the Park
Club into camp In easy fashion.
The matches yesterday were nearly all
one-sided and lacking in interest. Most
of the poorer players were disposed of.
To-day and to-morrow some great games
are expected.
â¢ In the men's singles play was com
pleted down to the second round with
two exceptions. Those who won thoir
way into this round are: W. B. Collier,
Grant . Smith, Harry Rolfe, Percy Mur
dock, A. C. Way and Harry Routh. Bell
and MacGavin will meet in the first
round this morning, as will Whitney
and Russell.
The third day's play of the champion
ship tennis tournament on the Hotel Ra
fael courts was given over to the men's
singles and the completion of the women's
singles. In the latter event Miss Florence
Sutton defeated her sister. Miss. Violet,
In the final after the latter had beaten
Miss Myrita Seymour In the semi-finals.
Although Miss Florence Sutton won
from Miss Violet Sutton in straight sets,
the play was very close. Both players
stayed In the back court and consequent
ly long rallies resulted. Miss Florence
was the steadier and her victory was due
to this fact. The score was 6-3, 6-3.
In the semi-flnal Miss Seymour was no
match for Miss Violet Sutton. The latter
won with the loss of but one game in two
sets. The score was 6-0, 6-1.

SUMMAEY.
Held a 1 to 3 chance for the five-furlong
selling number, Caesar Young's gray,
sprinter E. M. Brattain was again beaten.
He had no excuse this time, for, away in
front, he galloped into the stretch, but
wanted to lie down the last sixteenth and
Hildebrand astride - Glendennlng scored
almost easily in fast time. There were
only five starters and Maresa experienced
no difficulty in securing show honors.
A cluster of cheap platers started In the
third run, with Hughey Jones' Legal
Maxim enjoying the honors of favoritism.
The gelding never could get to the front,
finishing an indifferent third. The gray
horse Gold Scratch,' a half-brother to old
Braw Scott, with Bennett in the saddle,
and Tamm, ridden by FrawlejOndulged
in a long drive, the latter being awarded
a nose decision. The winner was one of
the third choices.
Lee Jackson piloted Little Margaret for
his "old employer, Caesar Young, in the
five-furlong spin, fifth on the card, but
failed to put her over the plate. The filly
ruled a 7 to 5 choice and was beaten al
most easily by Royal F, the outsider of
the quintet, on which Willie See had the
mount. 'Hercules played his string out
and then fell backTrom the firing line.
A nose finish' which saw the number of
Kitty Kelly hoisted on top caused grief
among the backers of Judge Voorhies, fa
vorite for the las^ event at seven fur
longs. The duo ' locked . horns a furlong
from the stand and the mare, well han
dled by Charley Chandler, had it on the
colt just a shade as they passed the
judges. Illowaho . seemed sore and ran
disappointingly., F. e. MULHOLLAND.
SCOEES IN FAST TIME.
So good a thing for the trotting special
was Dan Frazler considered that the
books laid but 1 to 4 about him. Cuicello
had him in front from the time Dick Ha
vey gave the word, and Dollexa, driven
by Jack Groom, was the nearest contend'
er at the wire, the mile and a half being
covered in 3:32^. Third money went to
Mamie Elizabeth, with Walter Maben in
the sulky.
Samar, from the stable of Bianchi &
McGovern, was installed a favorite for
the maiden event, but was outfooted from
the Jump, finishing third. Wandering
Boy, backed from 6 down to 4^, passed
Royaycopper before the stretch was
reached and won as he liked. Piratical,
on which there was a steady play, stood
a long drive, beating Samar for place
honors. v-<.' ;;
The fields at the park were again light,
but seven carloads of horses are due from
Seattle and the sport ought to improve
later In the week.
Dan Frazler, an odds on choice, took
the trotting dash at one and a half miles
and In the five running events the fa
vorites, Samar, E. M. Brattam, Legal
Maxim, Little Margaret and Judge Voor
hles, all met with defeat. In disposing
of E. M. Brattain, Glendennlng created a
new track record for five furlongs of one
minute flat.
ond. The books at Agricultural
Park did not handle money enough to pay
clerk hire. All the Burplua currency In
the family treasury was carted out by Its
owners to the show lot to purchase red,
white and blue lemonade, gingerbread and
peanuts to feed the elephants. Then
again, if the mercury in the thermometers
continues its record breaking attempts
the proper promenade costume for J and
K streets to-morrow will be an abbre
viated bathing suit and a pair of san
dals.

LOS AKGELES, Sept. 2.â Carrick,. the for
mer bir. leaguer, who pitched such a' strong
game against Lcs Angeles last' week, was the
easiest proposition of. the season to-day.- The
Seraphs won by a. score of- 12 to Â«. The game
was notable for several things. It took lorige
to play than any previous nine-inning-game'evÂ»r
played on. the grounds and the locals made thV
record number of hit* oh the home grounds
this season. Drinkwater was batted hard "but
clever fielding kept the score down. Â¦ The game
dragged dreadfully at times. Spies and Cm

down richt field line and Heiny went out of

8HEEPSHEAD BAT. Sept. 2.-Thou
sands declared that Hermis should have
been beaten to-day by John Sanford's
game and faat fllly\ Molly Brant. The
noted racer, who gave evidence at Sara
toga of having returned to his best form
having defeated Irish Lad in the Mer
chants' and Citizens' handicap, was pitted
to-day against a field which was not as
strong as those he may be called upon to
meet before the season Is over. Never
theless, it numbered some fast racers,
among them Molly Brant, who on Au
gust 13, at about the same difference in
weight, had forced Hermis to do his beat
to win. If opinions of clever Judges count
for anything Molly Brant should have
won. Jenkins delayed his run too long
and there is no doubt that Sanford's mare
was going stronger and fast getting up to
Hermis as the Judges' stand was reached.
Many a plunger who had laid odds on
the Thomas horse breathed more freely'
as the race ended. Summary:

The game started well and for aw.hllÂ»
the fans had a chance to enjoy them
selves. This sweet condition of affairs waÂ»
put out of commission in the fifth round,
when "Willie O'Hara shamefully muffed

hand and the Browns scored three runs.
They had a few before that \ and were
well. In the lead from that time- on. Â¦

The most loathsome and repulsive of all NpSe^il/
living things is the serpent, and the vilest and
â¢most degrading of all human diseases is Contagious Blood Poison. The
serpent sinks its fangs into the flesh and almost instantly the poison passes
through the entire body. Contagious Blood Poison, beginninfwith a little
ulcer, soon contaminates every drop of blood and spreads throughout the
whole system Painful swellings appear in the groins, a red rash and
copper colored splotches break out on the body, the mouth and throat
become ulcerated, and the hair and eye brows fall out ; but these symptoms
are mild compared to tne wretchedness and suffering that come in the latter
stages of the disease when it attacks the bones and more vital parts of the
dy - H 1 *}*** 11 **?* B lood Poison is seen in all its hideous-
ness. The deep eating abscesses and sickening ulcers and tumors show
the whole system is corrupted and poisoned, and unless relief comes soon
this serpent disease tightens its coils and crushes out the life. The only
antidote for the awful virus is S. S. S. It is nature's remedy, com-
S / Â« s >*â^Â» posed entirely of vegetable ingredients. S. S. S
f^4 r<^Â»l destroys every vestige of the poison, purifies the

awful taint to others. Nothing else will do this.

dry up the sores and drive in the disease, but do not cure permanently.

The most popular mining : promoter and
raconteur r of the Pacific Northwest Is dy

traveled through the mining districts of

drank from a stream by. the roadside. A
cyanide mill discharged Into the stream
close above and he inadvertently swal
lowed a chemical solution used in the pro
cess. The poison entered his system and
he was ill for, several weeks, but finally
it was thought he had recovered. A- re
lapse occurred and he was sent to the hos
pital at Milwaukee, where his daughter
resides. The latest telegraphic reports are
to the effect that the physicians have
given up all hopes and this intelligence
has been broken to the sufferer.

Marshal Kerns Is trying to trace the
shooter and believes he has a clew In a
footprint found in front of the Hicks
home.
"With a reckless disregard of the conse
quences, some miscreants fired a volley of
pistol shots shortly after midnight this
morning on Benvenue avenue. OnÂ© of
the bullets crashed through a plate glass
window in the front of the residence of
Lewis Hicks of 2631 Benvenue avenue, and
that no one was killed was no fault of the
shooter, for he kept on firing- shot after
shot. After going through the glass the
bullet dropped to the floor, having been
nearly spent. The noise aroused members
of the family, who went downstairs and
later found the bullet - on the carpet In

Herons that cannot roost In Alameda
without annoying its residents will have
to leave town or suffer the consequences.
Dr. Kate P. Van Orden has complained to
the Board of . Health and Informed its
members of the bacchanalian revels of the
peace-breaking squawkers that take up
their abode nightly in the vicinity of Paru
street and San Antonio avenue.
"Thea.e birds are a nuisance," said Dr.
Van Orden. "They congregate in flocks
In the trees and -make night hideous with
their screams. They are a menace to
the neighborhood and especially annoying
and alarming to ladles and children after
dark. Something should be done to drive
.the herons away."
As Dr. Van Orden is herself a mem
ber of the Board of -Health it has been
decided to instruct Sanitary Inspector Eu
gene C. Malllott to confer with Chief of
Police John Conrad and arrange for a
war of extermination against the birds
that squawk. Maillott believes that the
herons can be driven from the trees with
a fumigating apparatus. Conrad favors
shooting the bipeds and City Electrician
G. A". Wiese asserts that he can string
a number of live wires through the trees
that will end the squawking of any heron
that essays to roost upon them.
ALAMEDA, Sept/2.-Hundreds of night
herons that equawk are causing more ex
citement and disturbance in the fashion
able residence neighborhood of Paru
street and San Antonio avenue than ever
did the arrival of a stork in that vicinity.
Officials of the health, police and electric
light departments have' been called upon
to suppress or capture, dead or alive, the
noisy feathered bipeds that go on a
"bird" of. a time every, night and Inter
rupt the slumbers and snores of law
abiding citizens and taxpayers living In
that section of the city. Several groves
of trees In the afflicted district afford the
loud-mouthed herons first-class lodgings,
and when great flocks of the squawkera
come home roost at. late nocturnal
hours, when even sober people are com
pelled to locate the keyhole with a match,
everybody in the neighborhood, whether
asleep or awake. Is apprised of the ar
rival of the blustering birds.
.PHOENIX, AriÂ«., Sept 2.â a. south
bound freight train on the Santa Fe,

she Epent the afternoon in the witness
chair. Attorney Moore attempted to con
tradict her statement in regard to the
brakeman calling out that the next sta
tion was JClles. To maintain his point

case. As the former suit was brought
by the plaintiffs stepfather, S. C. Man
pon. and this statement made by him to
the attorneys the court ruled she could
not be bound by It
The jurors trying the case are: "W. D.

when it suddenly started and she was
thrown off. The train had stoused be
fore reaching the station. The girl's head

The Epplnger case was resumed yester
day afternoon at 2 o'clock before Referee
Milton J. Green. The attorneys for the
creditors are still trying to learn who
has a valid lien on wheat based on ware
house receipts.
P. E. Bowles of the American National
Bank was thÂ« principal witness. He cer
tainly made an excellent witness for
himself and the bank he represented. For
nearly two hours Attorney Freldenrich
piled him with questions regarding Els
Interest In the grain in the Crockett
warehouse.
It was almost like pulling teeth to get
any answers. Even then many that he
gave were evasive and la one or two in
stances he gave no answers. When It
came to the question of the report that
Mr. Gove had handed to him on June 2
he was unable to say exactly what had
become of It. He didn't know where it
was. He thought it nv.ght have been
given to his attorneys. Again when
Freldenrich pressed the question of what
had become of that report the witness
was advised by his attorneys not to an
swer the question and ho promptly acted
on their advice.
When, it came to the subject of the pro
posal of the transfer of some of Herman
Eppinger's property at Dlnuba and Heed
ley to the American National Bank the
witness could hardly be forced to throw
any light upon the Incidents that in
volved that discussion. The interview
had taken place in Mr. Chickerlng'e of
fice and, although the witness was pres
ent, he apparently had vague Ideas of
what had taken place at that meeting.
When it came to the subject of this
disposal of certain amounts of wheat that
had been shipped from Monroevllle to
Port Costa for account of the bank, the
witness said that Moore, Ferguson . &
Co. had acted as brokers and had sold
the wheat for account of the bank. He
admitted that the amount derived from
the sale of that wheat was over and
above the amount due to the bank for
which that especial lot of wheat had
been given as collateral. The balance of
the money had been applied to some of
the other notes that the bank held
against the Eppingers. He could not say
to which ones.
Attorney Freldenrich wanted to know
just exactly how the matter stood and
wanted to see the books. A general
wrangle ensued and finally Freldenrich
won his point and a copy of the books
was ordered to be brought before the
referee.
The witness was very positive he had
never seen Mr. Demmingr until June 7.
Then the question of the marking of the
bags en June 4 came up. They had been
marked on that date with a stencil plate,
some in the name of the American Na
tional Bank and some in the name of
the Bank of Monterey. The witness ad
mitted that it had not been customary to
mark bags with the name of the bank
when grain was accepted as collateral,
but it had been done In this case.
Further hearing In the case will be re
sumed on Friday, September 11, at 2 p. m.

Hattie Van Horn is suing Melden Van

that for the last three years he has treat

has repeatedly told her he did not love
her and wished she would get a divorce.
They were married in 1888 and have three
children, the custody of whom Mrs. Van
Horn asks for.
Captain Martin, an army officer, is the
disturbing element in the family of Wil
liam J. Kohn and Gertrude Kohn, a
young couple who were married only four
months ago at San Jose. It developed
yesterday during the divorce proceedings
brought by Mrs. Kohn that she cared
more for the dashing trooper than she
did for her civilian husband and had not
hesitated about informing some of her
friends of that fact. It also developed
during the hearing that she had once told
her husband that she thought so little of
him that she would not wipe her dirty
shoes on him. The court granted Kohn
a divorce on his cross-complaint, his wife
not appearing to prosecute her charge of
desertion.
Minnie C. Juchter has been the wife of
Frank Juchter only since July 29 .last and
she is already tired of her venture. She
filed /suit for divorce against him yes
terdayv charging him with extreme cru
elty, alleging that he was brutal to her
during their honeymoon, which was spent
at Placerville. According to tho com
plaint their unhappiness is due to the
presence in the family of 'a child of Mrs.
Juchter by a former marriage. She
charges that her husband seems to take
a particular delight in abusing the little
one and that during the first week of
their marriage he made his dislike evi
dent by beating the child. When their
honeymoon was over, she says, and while
they were living In this city at 1207 Mar

The Board of Public "Works yesterday
decided to use an Ingenious plan to as
certain if B. Lantry & Sons, who have
the contract for grading the streets In
the Potrero contiguous to th* Santa Fe
properties, are causing any damage by
blasting operations. The plan as outlined
by President Casey Is to send an Inspec
tor In disguise at various times to the
scene and he will investigate for the
board as to whether the amounts of pow
der and dynamite used In the blasts are
within the limits allowed by the ordi
nance. Some practical man who knows
all about blasting will be chosen for the
work of inspection and he will be un
known to tho contractors or the residents
In the vicinity of the place where blast
ing Is carried on. On the inspector's re
port the board will determine whether
the blasting shall cease or be carried on
In a legal manner.
Action was taken on a petition of resi
dents of the Potrero that the blasting be
stopped owing to" the damage caused
thereby to adjacent residences. One peti
tioner testified that three roofs had been
caved in by flying boulders and that the
powder charges shook up buildings in an
alarming manner. Another resident tes
tified that Lantry & Sons had offered to
pay for the damage to the roofs at 70'J
and 711 Tennessee street.
A delegation of- property owners on
Buena Vista avenue, between Haight and
Waller streets, appeared before the board
.to urge the improvement of the block
described. It was represented that the
Board of Supervisors had passed a reso
lution requesting the Board of Works to
expend $500 put of. its county road fund,
the property owners to expend an equal
amount. '
"That resolution Is not worth the paper
it is written on," said President Casey)
"It is simply a recommendation. How
ever, we will take this matter up and I
think that in all likelihood the money
will be found to do the work."
The trial of J. J. Connolly, a plasterer,
who was suspended by President Casey
on the report of Chief Janitor Syron tha^
Connolly had been derelict in his duties.
was begun before the board. Connolly
was represented by H. McPlke as attor
ney and testified that on the day he was
reported by Syron as having been away
from his work he was occupied in another
part of the City Hall. Connolly was cor
roborated by Mike Dolan, his assistant.
Syron and Assistant Head Janitor
O'Brien both testified that they had called
seven times at the place where Connolly
was supposed to be working and each time
he was absent. It was also stated that
while Connolly was working at the City
and County Hospital complaints Were re
ceived that he was not an active work
man. The trial of Connolly was desul
tory, although at one time hostilities
seemed imminent between Syron and
Commissioner Schmitz, who Is trying to
save Connolly from dismissal. The board
then took the matter under a_visement
until the return of Commissioner Manson,
who is in Santa Clara County.

cific Company yesterday. Mrs. Ward was
treated at the Railroad Hospital for her
injuries and was operated on twice, each
time losing a portion of her foot. Ward
claims that the physicians were careless
In their treatment and that In February
of last year, when sh'e was far from well,
cruelly and heartlessly transferred her
from the Railroad Hospital to the County
Hospital of San Mateo County,
That his death resulted from an accident oc
casioned by an attempt on his part to traverse
the private property of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company, consisting of their right of
Â¦nay. The showed that he was run
over by two cars and an engine of the said
railroad company, causing injuries resulting in
death. In our opinion the said railroad com
pany, or their employes, were In no manner to
blame for the accident.
In the inquest on the body of John
Fleming of -M4 Brannan street, who was

An Inquest was held yesterday morning

Its verdict the jury said: - v
Tho deceased attempted to board a south

in motion shortly after it had started from
the stop made Just south of Sutter street. He
only partially obtained ,a footing on the car,
fell therefrom, his head struck the street pave

Hay remains about as before. The circular
of Homers & Co. says :
"Arrivals for the week show a total of 5100
tons, an increaee over the week preceding of 000
tons. With such heavy shipments, the situa
tion has not been at all firm and matters have
been dragging, especially with the medium an<l
poorer grades of hay. We still note a con
tinuance of the general endeavor to have every
thing Bnder cover at thÂ° earliest possible date,
but until the fields are olaned there will be
but little change In the situation here. Liver
more & Hollister are phlpplnf? but sparingly,
most of the wheat hay now coming being rather
coarse rummer fallow. Alfalfa is not In very
plentiful Fupply. the bulk of present arrlvala
being shipped on orders and not offered on the
market. Choice grade clover hay is also a bit
scarce and a limited quantity will sell at gooil
figures. Tame oat hay Is coming In very free
ly and in spite of its popularity is selling rather
slowly at jireaent.
The Government has just advertised for sev
eral thousand tons of hay for Manila. As yet
this has affected the market In no way, for
bids will be received both at Portland and at
the Sound ports, and It la a question as to
which district can furnish the order most
cheaply. Other than this, there has been
nothing of interest that will In any way affect
the future of our market, co much will depend
on the season from this time on."

AUGUST KEAI/TY BALES
ABE $2,794,108 I2T TOTAiL
Summer Dullness Causes Decrease in
the Number of Transaction* In
the Local Market. :
According: to Thomas Magee A Bom''
Real Kstate Circular. Isued yesterday, the
eales of realty in San Franctoc'o during
the month of August amounted to $2,7K
108. The transactions numbered 463. . Th*t
la a smaller number than for any other
recent month of the present year. The
Circular gives the following explanation
of the falling off: . i
The decrease in the amounts of sales' is due
to the usual summer dullness, and to the dis
turbed condition of the Eastern money market,
which, however, only affects us Indirectly.
Locally there seems to bÂ« no disturbing reason
for the smaller total of sales except the ques
tion of decided lack of supply of good in
vestment properties in the 60-vara. and 10O-.
vara districts. This lack has been caused
by very heavy buying for the past year and
by the continued advance in price of the bal
ance of properties .which are for sale. Many
properties are now In the market at prices
which present Improvements and present rÂ«nts
will not Justify, but which would be salable
If buyers were not prevented from erecting suit
able improvements by the prohibitive price of
labor and material and the uncertainty of both.
There were 355 mortgages recorded last
month, amounting to $1,757,450. with 2S3 re
leases recorded for $1,620,007. There is still a
fair demand for money, which is easily sup
plied by the banks. The Interest rate remains
at 6 per cent, the banks paying the mort-.
gage tax. Considerable money is needed at
this time of the year by the Interior of the
State for the harvesting and moving of crops,
but this demand is easily met by the county
banks, who have had an abundance of fund*
all through the prosperous times of the last
three or four years.

The yachts were not even seat across the
line. Both boats Â¦were towed out to. the.
Sandy Hook Lightship in a dense fog and
fiat calm at 10:30 a. m. and then waited
two hours In the hope of a.' wind " from
some other direction than the east to '
blow away the fog and give them spefed
enough to cover' thirty. miles within five
and a half hours. The accompanying fleet
| was reduced to- Just twenty- three traft.
Besides the New York Yacht Club's -tag.
the revenue cutters and, the newspaper
fleet, there- was only one excursion
steamer and a few yachts. * .'Â¦'
Sir Thomas Upton to-day emphatically
denied persistent rumors that, he 'had
made these two assertions: ' ."* â¢ "
Firstâ That if there was any chance* fpr
i the Shamrock III to win he would depose.
Captain "Wringe and put | the yacht in
command of Mate Bemia. . ' Â¦ Â¦ â¢

The order of modification of Judge Ker
rigan is drafted after the one issued by
Judge Murasky and simply eliminates cer
tain words so as to broaden the prohibi
tive measure to the end of the Union
Pacific line at Omaha and to include the
Rio Grande system's lines, practically es
tablishing an embargo on all brokerage
business with tickets this side of Omaha.
Daley, lot on S line of Eighteenth street 25
W of Utah. W 25 by S 100; 110.
It was mainly the question of jurisdic
tionâthat Is. whether the State court
had authority to abridge the rights of
brokers to deal in tickets applying to rail
roads beyond the Jurisdiction of the State
â that prompted Judge Murasky to modify
his Injunction confining it to the lines
of the plaintiffs. Under its provisions the
brokers could buy and sell portions of
tickets over lines beyond the terminals of
the Southern Pacific, Union Pacific and
the Rio Grande system, and they pro
ceeded to do so, until Judge Kerrigan,
without previous notice to the defendants*
attorney, yesterday again changed the
order, which gives the railroad companies
the upper hand for a time, in that the
only portions of tickets that tke brokers
can now handle are those for transpor
tation over lines east of Omaha. Judge
Kerrigan's order caused considerable talk
among the brokers, who are now prepar
ing -to bitterly fight the railroad compa
nies through all the courts. It is claimed
that a recent decision handed down by
Justice Parker of the Supreme Court de
clares that the business of ticket broker
is a legitimate one, and that' the
man who buys a ticket from a
railroad company and permits another
man to use it is not injurine the com
pany and is not guilty of an act of fraud.
This contention is to be one of several
which the local brokers purpose to in
corporate in their flght against the South
ern Pacific Company when the latter, at
tempts to again enjoin them against the
selling of excursion or regular tickets.
"An order modifying an order modify
ing an injunction" Is the titla of a ruling
made yesterday by Judge Kerrigan In
the suit brought by the Southern Pacific,
Union Pacific, Denver and Rio Grande
and the Rio Grande Western Railroad
companies on August IS against the local
ticket brokers for an Injunction that
â¢would prohibit them from dealing In spe
cial excursion tickets during the Grand
Army Encampment. . .
In making his order yesterday Judge
Kerrigan apparently forgot a previous
ruling made by him and upset one. re
cently issued by Judge ilurasky In the
same cases. An injunction against Ticket
Brokers Adolph Ottinger, Charles Conk
lin, Duffln & Welsh and others was Issued
by Judge Muraaky. and later the plain
tiffs went Into court and by affidavit se
cured citations against Duffln & Welsh
to show cause why they should not be
adjudged in contempt for alleged viola
tions of the injunction. Upon the repre
sentations of their attorney, Samuel M.
Shortrldge, Judge Muraaky afterward
modified his Injunction, agreeing that it
was too broad and general. He there
fore eliminated certain sentences which
practically left the order applicable to
the lines of the plaintiffs instead of pro
hibiting the brokers from handling tick
ets of any description on any of the many
lines throughout the country.
The contempt case was to have come
up for a hearing some days later, but
on the date set Judge Murasky was ab
sent, and Judge Kerrigan, sitting In his
stead, announced that be would not bear
evidence or argument in any contested
case during the absence of Judge Mu
rasky, and set the railroad case down for
September 14. Apparently this disposed
of the matter until Judge Murasky was
ready to hear It, and naturally the de
fendants and Attorney Shortridge were
greatly surprised yesterday afternoon
when they were served with an order
from Judge Kerrigan's court modifying
the order Issued by Judge Murasky, in
which he had modified his own original
order of injunction.

Justice of the Peace Daniels gave judg.
ment for $60 yesterday in favor of Samuel
Nichols, who sued S. G. Spier for the
rental of a room in the Argyle Hotel. The
testimony developed that Spier and Nich
ols were partners in the hotel business
and had a disagreement which is now
pending in the Superior Court. Nichols
was appointed receiver to carry on the
business and learned that Spier had
leased to himself for $5 a month a room
connecting with the cafe. Spier had
signed the partnership name to the lease.
Nichhls said the room was reasonably
worth $10 per month and Incidentally tes
tified that Spier was in the habit of using
the electricity from the hoteljn his cafe
business.

Brief remarks were made by Father
Sark and others and then volunteers
were called for to aid in distributing cir
culars setting forth briefly reasons for
the support of the section relating to the
St. Mary's square appropriation in the
proposed bond issue. Nearly everybody
in the meeting volunteered for this ser
vice and will report the progress they
make to the secretary to be read at, a
subsequent meeting.
The speaker paid a high tribute to
Father Stark for his indefatigable efforts
on behalf of the movement and also eulo
gized the late Rev. Dr. Foute for the
zealous stand he took in his lifetime- in
forwarding the work of the association.
An unusually enthusiastic and well at
tended meeting of the St. Mary's Square
Association was held last night in St.
Mary's Hall on California street for the
purpose of starting a campaign in favor
of that section of the proposed bond is
sue, which allots $205,000 for the purpose
of purchasing, that section lying between
Dupont, California, Pine streets and St.
Mary's place, which has been condemned,
and transforming it into a public park.
George D. Shadburne, president of the
association, occupied the chair and
Father Stark acted as secretary. The
chairman briefly reviewed the work of
the association since its organization,
telling of its small beginning away back
in lbSS and the struggle it had made for
decency and improvement. He spoke of
the first appropriation made by the Board
of Supervisors of $30,000, which was sub
sequently annulled by the bad faith of
certain city officials. Subsequently an ap
propriatioft of $75,000 was granted, and
after a season of struggle was ' made
available. Out of that sum was pur
chased the property running from Dupont
street to St. Mary's place, fronting on
California street, which now belongs to
the city. The speaker said that this
movement was the entering wedge for the
conversion of Chinatown into a vast pub
lic park.
The balance of the site* of the proposed
square, he said, has been condemned and
the Sl'05,000 granted in the proposed bond
issue, together with $30,000 still remaining
from the original appropriation by the
Board of Supervisors, will be ample' to
convert the former plague spot of vice
into a beautiful park, lit for the recrea
tion of children and the enjoyment ' of
older people. . ''
Coroner Leland was notified of the case,
but Inasmuch as the child had evidently
died a natural death and a Dr. Mason,
who had prescribed for it at one time, was
willing to eign a death certificate,
deemed it unnecessary to take an official
action.
The neighbors generally bear out the
charge that the parents are frequently
intoxicated and that the children are neg
lected. The Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children will make an inves
tigation and if it is thought advisable
will take steps to have the children
moved to more beneficial surroundlngc
Officers McMurray and ~oung for the
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to
Children were notified by the neighbors
and visited the squalid abode. In addi
tion to the dead and ill babies they found
three other children, the eldest being 7
years of age. They were unkempt and
neglected, but seemed to be sufficiently
nourished. The husband appeared to be
thoroughly sober, but the wife was ptlll
under the Influence of liquor and the
death cf her little one. seenu-d to have
made no impression on her.
Tuesday night, according to the testi
mony cf the neighbors, Kinsbay and his
wife indulged in a drunken carousal.
Yesterday morning the husband arose
and went to his work at thÂ»; tin shop of
Crexn & Co., at Druam and Sacramento
streets. A little later the landlady, living
across the hall, arouseU Mrs. Kinsbay
from a drunken stupor to place in her
arms the dead body of her child. The
mother was too befuddled with liquor to
comprthend the situation and the father
Â¦was sent for. He secured the services of
Dr. Poaps, who ministered ta the other
twin and gave some hope for its recov
ery. He said that the surviving baby
was suffering from acute Indigestion due
to "improper nourishment, and he thought
that the other one had died from the
same cause.
Neglect of two babies only three months
old by their parents, Robert Kmsbay and
his wife, was the cause of the death of
one of the little ones some time during
Tuesday night or yesterday morning in
squalid lodgings at 5:5 Howard street.
The other one was found in an almost dy
ing condition, but prompt medical assist
ance may save its life, provided It is giv
en proper attention.

Still another action growing out of the
failure of the grain firm of Epplnger &
Co. was commenced yesterday. It Is a
suit for 51500 rent, and the plaintiff Is
Jacob Levi Jr., owner of a one-half inter
est in the warehouse at Crockett wherein
the grain owned by the firm is stored.
The defendants are Henry "Wadsworth,
receiver of the firm, and the numerous
banks that claim an interest in the grain.
Permission to commence the action was
given Levi by Judge Kerrigan a few days
ago, though Gavin McNab. as legal rep
resentative of the Bank of Monterey,, took
exception to the ruling. Levi claims that
though" he has frequently demanded of
Wadsworth rental for the warehouse the
latter has persistently refused to pay it.
Judge Kerrigan also made an order em
powering Receiver "Wadsworth to sell the
grain owned by the Eppingers and stored
in the Crockett warehouse. The grain
is to be sold at private sale, in lots, and
return is to be made to the court twenty
days after the sale.

She said she met White when he was
employed in Curtin's dry goods store.
She said she freauently met White on
the street and asked t him how his wife
was, and he always replied that she was
well and was traveling in Europe, hav
ing a crand time.
John Merriman, an insurance broker,
testified that he talked with White six
months before the latter's death and he
said that he was living apart from his
wife. Attorney Treadwell tried to get
the witness to , admit that White might
have said "separated," but Merriman
stuck to his original statement.
The plaintiff's counsel introduced the
summons and affidavit of the White di
vorce suit, and then asked that the case
go over, as they had no other witnesses
on hand. Judge Troutt pu* the matter
over until to-morrow morning.
"When did Lloyd White cease writing
letters to you?" asked Judge Aitken.
"After the year 1SS5," replied the wit
ness.
"After that how did you receive com
munications from him?"
"ThrouKh his mother."
LLOYD.
LETTERS NOT PRODUCED.
Mrs. White explained that she wagered
$10 with "White's mother that if Jonathan
Lloyd White came to New York the first
one he wr.uld call upon was his wifp. She
wrote him, and he replied as follows:
Dear Jennie: I wish you had more sen^e.
Don't you know by this time that if I arrived
In New York to-morrow morning the first per
son I wouIJ call on would be yourself? I see
mother is too cute for you and she proposes
to win your- $10 from you. Why don't you
drop me a line or are you sick? Your last let
ter I got and I laughed well when I read It.
1 told mother the whole secret about us. I
could not keep it any longer from her, knowing
as I do how much she thinks of you. Huslness
is frightfully dull here and every one is com
plaining, ljut we must cheer up and trust to
luck. Write me a letter soon. I am longing
to go to New York. And it won't be Ions now
before I am with you all. With love. Yours,
WAGERED WITH MOTHER.
If this letter had been admitted in evi
dence the attorneys would have .show.i
that- "White "was corresponding with his
wife after the divorce.
The witness was asked her age and de
clined to >rive it on the ground that la
dies seldom tell how old they are. It
developed that the divorce was granted
White in November, 1884. The witne33
swore positively that she did not learn
of thÂ« divorce until Mr. Pierce had in
formed her by letter. She stated she was
then in Alaska conducting a boarding
house. It was called the White House.
A great deal of stress was laid on a
letter dated June 9. 1S84, by the attor
neys for plaintiff. The witness was posi
tive she received it in 1SS3. The court
declined to receive it in evidence, as it
was dated in June of the year the "Whites
weie divorced. The witness swore that
sne received it in 1885 and that the date
was wrong. The court examined the doc
ument and made out the figure to be "-I."
The receipt is dated Â«iay m, 18S3, which
is alleged to be the day before Mrs. Tos
ney became the wife of Jonathan Lloyd
White. The attorneys for the defendants
will try to show that White paid back
all moneys he borrowed from the de
ceased.
Mrs. White was on the witness stand
the greater part of yesterday. The at
torneys for the defendants devoted tho
entire morninsr to a minute examination
of the witness* past life. They Interro
gated her about her birth, her aee, na
tivity, marriages, births and friends in
an effort to find some flaw In her testi
mony. Attorney Treadwell sprung a sen
eation during the examination by hand
ing the witness a receipt for $6000 which
was signed "Jeannle Tosney." The wit
ness positively' declared that she had
never seen the paper before and dented
that It was her slenature. Treadwell
thereupon compelled her to write the
name as it appeared in the receipt. Mrs.
White declared she never signed her
name that way. She spelled it "Jennie,"
but the court directed her to write it as
the defendants' counsel desired.
In the afternoon Theodore ivytka, the
handwriting expert, visited the courtroom
and examined the original receipt and
the writing of the witness.
DECLINES TO GIVE AGE.
The attorneys for Mrs. Jennie "White
were greatly handicapped yesterday by
Judge Troutt's ruling: that no communi
cation between hugband and wife dur
ing their marital relations could be dis
closed on the witness stand. Much testi
mony that intent be material to Mrs.
White's cast was thus kept out of the
record.
