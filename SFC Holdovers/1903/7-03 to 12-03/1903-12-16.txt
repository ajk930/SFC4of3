ALICE. Tex., Dec. 15. â The an
nouncement that Lady 'Constance Mac
kenzie would arrive on a certain date
led to an amusing mistake. A tele
gram informed R. J. Kleberg of the
Santa Gertrudes ranch of Lady Mac
kenzie's proposed visit, the dispatch
having been sent by a Northern Texas
ranchman, whom she had b6en visit
ing.
Kleberg was absent and the boss of
his ranch received the telegram. The
ranch boss is not up on titles of no
bility and he concluded that Lady
Mackenzie was a thoroughbred mare
that Kleberg was sending, so he tele
phoned to J. B. Ragland, a livery
stable man, that Lady Mackenzie
would arrive, and that, as she was a
high-bred animal. Ragland would be
expected to take especial care of her
until she could be forwarded to Kle
berg's ranch. A fine stall was pre
pared and the mistake was not dis
covered until the train arrived.

, Regarding the report about the dis
patch of troops to the isthmus of Pan
ama, the press is authorized to make
this statement: Until the Senate shall
have ratified the Hay-Bunau-Varilla
treaty the administration will look to
the marines to protect the isthmus and
keep order there, unless, In the" mean
time, it Is learned that a considerable
force of Colombian troops is to attack
Panama. In the latter event the pro
tection of the republic could be best
accomplished by the army, and troops
would supplant the marines. It may be
stated, however, that this Government
does not expect such an emergency to
arise at present, and has prepared to
retain the present force of marines In
Isthmian waters until after the ratifi
cation of the canal treaty.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 15.â The Gov
ernment of Panama is willing to allow
Colombia a portion of the cash sum to
be paid by the United States for' the
canal right-of-way. The amount so [
donated must be applied to paying the
foreign debt of Colombia.
It has been the contention of Great
Britain, Holland and some-other Euro
pean powers that the^ev*:' republic of
Panama* should assjnne^a. .' PQrUibn. * of
Colombia's foreign- debt. It became
known to-day that, all of Minister
Bunau-Varllla's regent visits to the
State Department have been in con
nection with this question. A point lias
been reached where the Minister an
nounces himself ready to sign an agree
ment that one-third of the 510,000,000
paid for the canal zone snail be turned
over to Colombia for the payment of
her foreign Indebtedness.
In reaching this decrsion Bunau-
Varilla has been largely influenced by
the advice of State Department offi
cials, who have urged him tq make
such concession.
Minister Beaupre cabled the State
Department to-day that he would leave
Bogota on December 20 and asked that
a warship be ordered to meet him at

States. He expects to reach Cartagena

Alvord was turned over to Sheriff
Lewis of Cochise County this morning
by the Government officer, who has
maintained a guard about the jail while
he was in their charge. This guard
was withdrawn this afternoon. Stiles,
against whom eleven Indictments had
been returned, was to have been tried
at Phoenix and In the meantime the
United Stages Attorney had permitted
the Territory to prosecute him * upon
the charge of shooting Jailer George
Bravin when Alvord and Stiles broke
out of the Tombstone jail after the
Fairbank robbery and escaped to So
nora.
Alvord there remained in hiding un
til the first of this year, when Stiles,
who had turned State's evidence, be
trayed him Into the hands of the offi
cers. Stiles afterward refused to tes
tify against Alvord and was himself
thrown Into jail to be tried for his
many crimes. Alvord had been kept In
jail at Phoenix and Stiles at Tucson
pending trial and were taken to Tomb
stone only a week aeo.
United States Marshal McCord, who
is at Tucson, has ordered all line towns
to send out patrolling parties. Captain
Rynning of the Arizona Rangers wired
at 9 o'clock to-night that he was about
to leave at the head of a posse, while
custom-house officers and local officials
at Naco, Nogales and other border
towns have wired that mounted In
spectors, rangers and officers have gone
out to endeavor to prevent the jail
breakers from crossing into Mexico.
United States Marshal McCord said to
night :
â¢â¢I confidently believe that both Stiles
and Alvord will be dead by morning
and possibly others of the band who
broke Jail. The men in pursuit are
determined, the criminals are desperate
and I don't see how they can avoid a
fight with the officers, for they will
never give themselves up again alive,
as they have many times boasted if
they ever escaped again. Everything
possible has been done to prevent them
crossing the line and I hardly see how
they can elude our men. I am hourly
expecting news from one of the pur
suing parties."
JAIL NOT GUARDED.
In the party are Forest Hill and Jack
Foster, both deputy United States Mer
shals and former members of the Ari
zona Rangers. They will shoot the
desperadoes at sight, taking no chances
at night with such desperate men as
both Stiles and Alvord are known to be.

James Bennett, who was indicted for
smuggling, was released on bond and
thrown Into prison again for smug
gling tools to Stiles and Alvord to be
used In making an escape. Bennett
served six years at Yuma for highway
robbery. Louis James, Indicted for a
daring murder committed at Bisbee,
was also among the prisoners and is
no doubt with them. Jack O'Brien and
Bob Depriest are also members of the
party, both of them highwaymen and
as desperate as their confederates.

NO QUARTER TO BE SHOWN.
TOMBSTONE, Ariz., Dec. 15.â Burt
Alvord and Bill Stiles, train robbers
and all-round desperadoes, together
with eight other prisoners, made their
escape from the old jail at Tombstone
at 6 o'clock, to-night by cutting a hole
through the wall. They at once made
their way to a thicket on the outskirts
of the town, where horses, arms and
ammunition had been concealed by
confederates, vaulted into their sad
dles and headed for the Mexican line,
thirty miles away.
Alvord, who was sentenced to a term
at Yuma in the United States court two
days ago, was to be taken away
shortly after 6 o'clock, and when the
Sheriff went to get his prisoner he dis
covered every man confined in the jail
had flown. He at once gave the alarm
and, summoning together six of the
best officers In the place, set out in
pursuit.

NEW YORK, Dec. 15.â War between
financial leaders of the country looms
large on the Wall-street horizon and
petty money handlers dread the conse
quences of what may be the greatest
battle ever fought between modern
trust masters.
John D. Rockefeller, George Gould
and Andrew Carnegie, in alliance
against A. J. Cassatt and the Pennsyl
vania Railroad Company, have planned
the undoing of that corporation, and
the first assault is to be directed
against that branch which is engaged
in the manufacture of steel rails. It be
came known in Wall street to-day that
the Fteel rail pool was to be dissolved
at the meeting of the steel tryst to
morrow. The trust controls fully 60 per
cent of the producing capacity of the
country. Heretofore it has been re-
Ftrlcted to an output of only 43 per cent
and has b*Â»en forced to share its profits
with its rivals when the output exceed
ed this percentage. Now It is prepared
to swing into competition 'with the in
dependent?, with its great capacity and
its power to cut rates.
Steel rails at 512 a ton are expected
and when this figure is reached the in
dependents will be driven to straits
and among the Independents hit hard
est will be the Pennsylvania Steel
Company, owned and managed by the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company.
The old enmity between John D.
Â¦Rockefeller end Morgan and his ally.
Cassatt. is to be made a live thing
through this fight. The Rockefellcr-
Carnegie-Gould combination controls
the steel trust and has its individual
fight with Carsatt. He has not re
tired, as the Rockefellers ordered him
to do and he has not been frightened,
apparently, by the threat to build a
Southern Pennsylvania railroad from
Pittsburg to Philadelphia. The Penn
sylvania Railroad, so far as can be
*y*en, shows no disposition to be forced
into ' submission to Rockefeller.
A demoralizing reduction in prices
ran be expected if open war breaks
out. The first cut is scheduled for
next week, when prices, it is said, will
be cut to $26 a ton. The effect upon
the Pennsylvania Steel Company will
be most Revere, however. The steel
trust will throw all its power of compe
tition against this company and will
force It to manufacture steel rails at a
rate permitting of little or no profit.

evening. He was crushed between an
elevator ahd the heavy Iron sidewalk
doors.
The unfortunate man. who had
been employed "In hl3 position but
three weeks, was assigned the duty
of locking the sidewalk doors at the
closing hour of the store. The' fas
tenings are on the inside and in order
to reach them It is necessary to do so
from the basement. As there were no
eye-witnesses to the tragedy, it is sup
posed that Sheehan stepped on the
elevator with the intention* of raising
it a sufficient distance, to permit him
to manipulate the locks. In some
manner he failed to shut off the power
and was slowly crushed to death.
The discovery of Sheehan's body
was made by George Dussan. the head
janitor, who Immediately lowered the

STOCKTON, Dec. 15.â Robert G.
Paddock, who is believed to be a rep
resentative of H. E. Huntington, is in
the city securing data preparatory ta
filing an application for a franchise to
bring a new electric, power line into
this city.
It is considered that this is the first
step toward \ the construction of an
electric car road from Bakersfteld
through Fresno, Stockton and to San
FrOnclSco. Mr. Huntington owns the
street railroads in Bakersfield and
Fresno and with Mr. Harriman holds
the controlling interest in the Stockton
road. By connecting the valley cities
he could make one of the longest And
best electric roads in the world. Mr.
Paddock guarantees that when a fran
chise is granted work will be com
menced nt once.

SAN BERNARDINO, Dec. 15.âMar
ried and for two montns happy, and
then to find out that another wife held
a claim upon the husband, is the rather
sensational story told in a divorce com
plaint filed yesterday, wherein Mrs. Ad
dio Parker, a prominent woman who
, resides on Third and H streets, seeks
a divorce from W. H. Parker.
They were married, according to the
complaint. In 1S97. The end of the sad
romance came two months after the
[ marriage. It was then, according to
the complaint, that the wife learned her
husband had deceived her; that he was
the husband of another woman, and the
discovery caused the parting.
Mrs. Parker forced her husband to
leave her and since then they have
j lived apart. His present whereabouts
are unknown.

j .SEOUL, Dec. 15. â More rioting has
taken place at Mokphe and yesterday
a Japanese mob wounded seventeen
Koreans. High Korean officials are
hurrying to Mokphe to try to quell the
disorder. So far Russia has not inter
fered.
United States Minister Allen has de
manded a definite answer from the
Korean Government in regard to the
opening of the port of Wiju. Despite
American, British and Japanese pres
sure, Ru/s'-an Influence over the
Korean Government is apparently un
shaken, and It is expected that Korea
will procrastinate, and, possibly, re
fuse, eventually, to act at all.
A feeling, of unrest Is growing
among the Korean people, who fear
that, whether it be peace or war be
tween Russia and Japan, the extinc
tion of the empire is imminent. It is
believed that the outbreak of hostili
ties or the announcement of a protec
torate of any kind will precipitate
trouble. Foreigners in Seoul expect"
disorder and the American residents
desire a warship. The Korean army,
numbering 8000 men, is considered
.one of the most dangerous factors of
the situation, . an insubordinate ele
ment being beyond official control. In
case of trouble. It is feared, the sol
diers will be the first to lead the riot
ing and begin looting.
A part of the Russian squadron has
already departed for Port Arthur and
the remainder of the fleet will follow,
leaving no warships of that nation In
Korean waters.

In Cuba, and other data to support ths

course in the sugar trust, which he
accused of invading the sugar beet
fields fcr the control of the sugar sup
ply. Patterson was proceeding to say
that he wc-uld be willing to have the
tariff on sugar reduced af there could
be a corresponding reduction in other
articles of import, when Aldrich. inter
runted him to ask .'if he were -willing
to make ad valorem rates on sugar, as
on other articles. Patterson replied that
hÂ» was willing to take the present tariff
basis, and he asked Aidrlch if . he con
sidered the tariff Inequitable. The
Rhode iFlard Senator replied that he
considered the tariff too high,- and
when Patterson was aoout to congrat

party. -
To this the reply was made .that the
Democratic party had been in power
but very little during the past fifty
years. Senator Stone took Issue with
his colleague and. favored firm caucus
action. When the vote was taken Sen
ator Cockrell, on account of his views,
was excused from voting. Two other
Senators voted against the proposition.
Senator Mallory moved to exclude
from the operations of the agreement
the pending Cuban reciprocity bill and
the Panama treaty, but this was voted
down. It was stated that questions
on which caucus action was to be taken
I would be considered as they arose.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â The Demo
cratic caucus to-day, after considerable
opposition, passed a resolution declaring
that caucus action of this party here
after should be binding and that all
members should abide by such caucus
action. The caucus Â¦will assemble to
morrow, when, it is expected, the Pan
ama treaty will be taken up. The res
olution to make the caucus binding
provides that any action so Indorsed
must" have a two-thirds vote.
The Panama canal situation was dis*
cussed and it .was" developed', that a
sufficient number of Democrats- would
vote !for the treaty to insure its rati
fication.
The action of the Democratic cau
cus in making the future decrees of
the caucus binding was not unanimous.
Senator Cockrell opposed this propo
sition, saying that during the past fifty
years such a proceeding was not re
garded as necessary by the Democratic
"It does not He in the mouth of any
man of the Republican party to com
plain-when v.c ask for the protection
of an infant Industry wblch falls within
the rule laid down by the. Republican
party." saM he.
compared those who were controlled by
this influence to "a nest of young rob
ins, standing with mouths wide open
and readv to -swallow even a reciproc
ity worm if dropped by the parent bird
at the White House."

WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â Rural free
delivery, reciprocity with Canada and
the new republic of Panama were top
ics of discussion in the House to-day.
The subject of rural free delivery was
introduced by Maddox (D.) of Georgia,
who claimed that certain States had
been faYored in the establishment of
routes. This allegation resulted in a
lively discussion.
Crumpacker (R.) of Indiana defend
ed the course pursued by the adminis
tration in dealing with the Central
American situation and replied to criti
cisms which have been made on the
opposite side of the chamber.
Crumpacker, in a colloquy with Wil
liams, the minority leader, asked if it
Svan r.oi trufi the Democrats were will
ing to accent the stolen goods if per
mitted to cor.demn the act of taking.
Witliams reoMed that while they emild
not recognize the character of the child
they could treat it properly.
Maddox (D.) of Georgia, replying to
Crumpacker, said he had arraigned the
party for" statements made by a few
members of the minority. He then
spoke on the rural free delivery. He
produced figures and declared that of
the 15,000 routes established last June
more than one-third we're located in
four States â Iowa, Indiana, Ohio and
Illinoisâ and that the first named two
States had more routes than twelve
Southern States which he named.
Gardner .(R.) of Massachusetts re
plied to the remarks of Lind (D.) of
Minnesota relative lo freer trade rela
tions with Canada. He said the cot
ton interests of this country would suf
fer if thrown into competition with la
bor in Quebec, which he declared to be
underpaid, and where, he said, the
standard of living was lower than in
the cott6n manufacturing: districts in
this country. Gardner spoke of the
fishing interests and how they would
be affected, and said the Question of
reciprocity sheuld be approached se
riously ard studied with care.
Rainc-y (D.) of Illinois said the Pana
ma car.al now was an assured fact.
He had r.o criticism to make regard
ing the recognition of the new republic,
but expressed the hope that free gov
ernment would be given to the Philip
pines, which, he said, yielded unwill
ingly to American authority. He saw
no objection to- the landing of Colom
bian trcois. In addition to â¢construc
tion of the Panama canal, he contended
for^ the construction of a deep water -
way from the Great Lakes to the Gulf
ot Mex'.co.
WASHINGTON', Dec. 18.â The execu
tive council of the American Federa
tion of Labor held conferences to-day
with Speaker Cannon and Congress
man Gardner, chairman of the House
Committee on Labor, discussing meas
ures in which the labor representatives
are interested. They requested con
sideration of the eight hour bill and the
prison labor anti-injunction bills. A
conference was also held with Presi
dent (pro tem.) Frye and Senator Mc-
Cornas, chairman of the Senate Com
mittee on Labor.
Speaker Cannon Informed his visitors
he had no doubt they \vould be given
a full and free hearing on the bills in
which they are interested, and said It
would be his duty as well as his pleas
ure to co-operate with them to secure
fair hearing and a full discussion of
all legislation they might suggest. The
Speaker told his visitors that they
would find the House organized for the
full and free discussion of all questions
touching the Interests of the American
people without regard to class distinc
tion, and that the House could not af
ford to try to secure legislation for
one class to the detriment of another.
Legislation, he said, should be for thÂ»
benefit of the whole people. The
Speaker assured the members of the
executive council that he was not op
posed to organized labor.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â Two bills
were. Introduced in the Sennte to-day
by Senator Penrose designed to
strengthen the laws regulating the use
of the malls. One Is aimed at the "get
rich-Quick" concerns and at guessing
contests, and includes the District of
Colurrfbia and "all territory within the
Jurisdiction of the United States" in \
the law forbidding the use of the mails
for the transmission of lottery tickets.
The bills were drawn In the law di
vision of "the Postofnce D?partment.
The act of 18S0. forbidding lotteries, is
amended by inserting the following
language in the prohibitory section:
"Or any person or company conduct-
Ing any competition or contest Involv
ing the award of prizes and based upon
the relative accuracy of guesses or esti
mates; or conducting any Scheme or
device for betting, wagering or making
pools on horseraces or other similar
contests."
This amendment is held to be neces
sary by reason of the Attorney Gen
eral holding that contests which involve
the award of prizes obtained upon the
relative accuracy of guesses" or esti
mates as to the number of votes in a
political election . or the number of
beans that a certain Jar contains, etc.,
are not in violation of the present lot
tery laws.
It is sought by the amendment also
to protect the public against fraud as
well as to suppress gambling which
accompanies betting on horses. Betting
on horseraces has been held not to be
within the purview of the lottery laws.
Consequently it is held that the only
way by which these turf investment
schemes can be suppressed under ex
isting laws Is upon the ground of fraud,
in which case it Is extremely difficult
to obtain sufficient evidence to warrant
an action. Such evidence cannot be
obtained in any event u:;tll after the
scheme has been In operation some time
and after the company has Sn its pos
session thousands of dollars of the pub
lic's money. ' *

DR. SHOOP'S REMEDIES.
I
Dr. Shoop's
Rheumatic Cure
Costs Nothing ff It Tails.
Any honest person who Buffers from Rheu-
matism is welcome to this offer. For years I
searched everywhere to find a specific for Ilhea-
matism. For nearly 20 years I worked to thii
end. At last. In Germany, my search was re-
warded. I found a costly chemical that did net
disappoint me as other Rheumatic prescriptions
had disappointed physicians everywhere.
I do not mÂ«an that Dr. Snoop" s Rheumatis
Cure can turn bony joints Into flesh again. That
Is impossible. But It will drive from the blocd
the poison that causes pain and swelling, and
then that is the end of Rheumatism. I know
this so well that I will furnish for a full month
my Rheumatic Cure on trial. I cannot cure all
Â«ases within a month. It would be unreason-
able to expect that. But rncst cases will yield
within 30 days. This trial treatment will con*
vine* you that Dr. Shoop's Rheumatic Cure Is
a power asainst Rheumatism â a potent fore*
against disease that Is Irresistible.
My offer Is made to convince you of my faitn.
My faith is but the outcome of experienceâ of
actual knowledse. I know what it can do. - And
I know this so well that J will furnish my rem-
edy on trial. Simply write mÂ» a postal for my
book on Rheumatism. - I will then axranffÂ» wits
a druggist in your vicinity so that you caa seÂ»
cure six bottles of Br. Shoop's Rheumatic Cur*
to make the test. You make take it a full month
on trial. If It succeeds the cost to you is S3 50.
If It fails the less Is mine and mine alone. It
will be left entirely to you. I mean that ex-
actly. I? you say the trial is not satisfactory I
don't expect a penny from you.
I have no samples. Any mere sample that
can aftect chronic Rheumatism must be drugged
to the verge of danger. I use no such drugs,
for it is dangerous to take them. Tou must get
ths disease out of the blood. My remedy does
that even, In the most difficult, obstinate cases.
It has cured the eldest cases that I ever met.
and In all of my experience. In all of my 2000
tests, I never found another remedy that would
cure one chronic caÂ»Â« In ten.
Write me and I will send you the book. Try
my remedy for a month, for It can't harm you
anyway. If It fails the loss is mini*.
Address Dr. Snoop. Box 630. Racine. WIs.
HIM cases not chronic are often cured by on*
cr two bottles. At all druggists. .

ANSWERS THE
LAST SUMMONS
PARIS, Dec. 15.â Sardou's "La Sor
ciere" was produced by Sarah Bern
hardt to-night in her own theater and
.was a great triumph for both author
and actress.
The action of the play passes in To
ledo in the middle ages. Zoroya, the
daughter of a Moorish physician, Is
enamored of Don Enrique, a Spanish
captain, who returns her passion, thus
braving the risk of the terrible pun
ishment allotted to a Christian who
unites himself with a Moor, and for
getting momentarily his betrothal to
Juana, the daughter of the Governor
of the city.
Juana, who is a sleep walker, seeks
a cure for her affliction at the hands
of Zoroya, whose scientific accomplish
ments have earned for her the repu
tation of a sorceress. Juana inciden
tally reveals to Zoroya that the man
whom she is to marry on the morrow 13
Don Enrique. ( Zoroya determines to
prevent the marriage, and, obtaining
entrance to the Governor's palace, puts
Juana to sleep.
Don Enrique, on approaching the
bridal chamber, finds at the threshold
a veiled woman, who overwhelms him
with reproaches. He explains that he
was betrothed to Juana before he
knew Zoroya and that honor compelled
the .fulfillment of his pledge. Zoroya.
influenced by Don Enrique's informa
tion, is about to forgive him when the
officer of the inquisition arrives to ar
rest her for witcherv. Don Enrique re
sists the officer and he and Zoroya are
carried before J.he fnquisition tribunal.
Bernhardt has a splendid scene in
which Zoroya, in order to save Don En
rique, confesses whatever is required of
her. She declares that she bewitched
Don Enrique, and that she alone is the
guilty one. The court acquits the cap
tain and condemns the woman to the
stake.
Guessing the truth. Don Enrique ar
rives at the place of executfon at the
same moment the pardon for Zoroya
from the Governor is received, the par
don being given because this Moor
alone is able to reawaken Juana. The
mob is furious at seeing its victim
about to escape and tries to seize her,
when Don Enrique draws his sword
and defends her until it is seen that
his efforts are hopeless. Then Zoroya
conveys poison to the captain by a
kiss and the two die together, amid
the howling of the mob.
The dramatic interest was splendid
ly kept up and Bernhardt's impersona
tion of the Moorish girl was magnifi
cent. " The staging , and the accessories

General of Society of Jesus
Who Is Made Defendant
Says Case Is One of Blackmail
ROME, Dec. 15.â Editor Spadoni of
the Roman Herald caused a summons
to be issued to-day against Father Mar
tin, general of the Society of Jesus, for
the purpose of obtaining compensation
with costs alleged to be due the editor
for work done by agreement with Fath
er Martin in the propaganda against
the American portion of the Catholic
church In the United States.
The editc-r says that Father Martin
promised to obtain from Pope Leo an
encyclical condemning this American
ism in the church and recalling Arch
bishop Ireland to due obedience to the
Holy See, while at the same time Spa
doni was to arouse public opinion
through the paper which he then pub
lished, and which was called the True
Catholic American, issued berth in Eng
lish and Italian. Beginning in Febru
ary, 1899, several thousand copies of
the paper were sent to the United
States.
Spadoni asserts that owing to this
writing and the influence of his paper
Americanism in the church had disap
peared to a considerable extent and
he called for the alleged promised com
pensation, not receiving which he had
recourse to the law courts. . The case
will be argued December 18.
Father Martin says that Editor Spa
doni's allegation is false and the case
is one of blackmail. He said he would
not appear in court, but would leave
the matter altogether in the hands of
his lawyer.
SHAW EXPLAINS
TO EMBASSADOR
'roves to Baron Sternberg
That Germany's Exports Are
Xot Discriminated Against
BERLIN. Dec. 15.â Count von Lim
burgr-Stirum, during the debate on the
budg-et in the Reichstag to-day, sharply
criticized the Government for failing to
take vigorous measures against the
Socialists. He drew a parallel of the
Germany of to-day and France prior
to the revolution and said he saw in
Germany the same unconcern and care
lessness on the part of the Government
that had existed in France.
Count von Bulow, imperial Chancel-
Jcr. protested against the comparison
and said that personally he lelt him
self perfectly free from the carcless
nefs prevailing amors the French rul
ing classes at the time. Of course, he
said, the ruler of France did not be
lieve that a revolution was coming,
but it came swift and bloody. "But
where in Germany," allied the Chan
cellor, '"are there oppressive privileges
of the nobility and clergy; where here
can be found luxurious courts; where
ths tithes and the vassalage under
which the peasants and burghers suf
fered at that time in France? Thanks
to our great Emperor and cur great
Chancellor, Bismarck, we have a social
kingdom; we have social reform legis
lation in every nook and corner."
After outlining the policy of the Gov
ernment dealing with soc:a!ism Count
von Bulow expressed the hope that the
debates of the past few days would
strengthen the confidence of the burg
her classes in the Government and also
strengthen their self-confldence, be
cause the present order of society "is
really much stronger than society itself
th'.nks."
Secretary of the Interior von Posa
dowsky-Wehner said that the Socialists
couJd accomplish much more for the
interests of the laboring classes if they
laid aside republican allurements.
The first reading of the budget was
finished and the Reichstag adjourned to
January 1.
Previous to the budget debate the
house passed the third reading of the
bHl prolonging for two years the modus
vivendi in trade relations with Great
Britain.

Souci Palace at the head of the Sec
ond Company of the First Regiment
of the Guards, of -which regiment he
had recently been" appointed colonel,
a few days before, on which occasion
it is reported the Emperor said he

WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â A confer
ence was held to-night in the White
House at which Secretary Shaw and
Baron Sternberg, the German Embas
sador, talked with the President in re
gard to the consular invoices of goods
Imported from Germany. The German
Embassador said that many of the
German manufacturers were unable to
understand how it was the - invoice
price of goods imported from Germany
into the United States was frequently
advanced by the customs officers at
these ports and the feeling prevailed
In some quarters, he said, that German
goods were being discriminated against
by the customs authorities of this coun
try.
Secretary Shaw in explanation stated
that consular officers abroad could not
be expected to know the real or market
value of many goods shipped from
their ports and prices given could only
be approximated to the market price.
Under the customs laws of the United
States the value of goods upon which
duties are assessed is the market value,
and it often happened, he said, that
unscrupulous importers secure in
voices at a lower value than the market
value, in the hope of decreasing '.heir
customs payment. Secretary Shaw
stated to Baron Sternberg that nothing
could be further from the purpose of
his officers than to discriminate against
German exports. All nations were
treated exactly alike.
The Embassador seemed to be fully
satisfied that no discrimination was
made in the case of German goods. Â£
BOSTON'S VOTE
IS DEMOCRATIC
Patrick " Collins Re - elected
Mayor of the Hub City by
a Record Plurality of 27,000
BOSTON, Dec. 15.â The Democrats
won an overwhelming victory in the
municipal election to-day. Mayor Pat
rick Collins was re-elected by 27,000
plurality. This is the largest plurality
ever given a mayoralty candidate* In
the history of the city. The Board of
Aldermen next year will be solidly
Democratic, and that party will have a
large majority in the Common Council.
The citv. as usual, favored licensed
liquor selling by a large majority.
The election to-day was notable for
the Republican apathy. The vote of
George H. Swallow,, the candidate for
Mayor, fell oft more than..33.per cent
from that given the party candidate
two years ago, while it ran nearly 20
per cent behind the. vote of Governor
Bates at the State election last month.
HAXXA REITERATES HIS
REFUSAL. TO BE CANDIDATE
Yet.the Wording of His Letter Is Such
as to Revive Hopes of His
Friends.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Dec 15.âSena
tor Hanna's friends are building some
hope of his permitting himself to be of
fered for Presidential honors on a sen
tence of the following letter, which one
of them received from him to-day:
"I have read with 'interest your kind
letter of the 4th inst. and assure you of
my sincere appreciation of the senti
ments expressed in the same and of
your regard and confidence In me. Such
suggestions as you make with reference
to next year are, of course, highly com
plimentary, but -my position on this
subject is well defined and known." Â¦Â¦'. I
have no personal ambition to serve, and
cannot be considered in any sense a
candidate for the Presidential nomina
tion. Sly only desire Is to : serve my
party to the extent of my ability."

welcome them as the ones upon whom
the mantle of bur great organization
must fall after we have passed away."
After the address of the post com

"At the first muster after the instal

recognized as one of the best posts in

now be made use of. Through this system the
students of the university will be largely
profited, a* the State Library will supply an7
books that tne university library does not con
tain. It Is intended that only books that can
be duplicated will be used in this new system,
not books that could not be replaced If lost.
The Christmas vacation will begin after
next Saturday, when the last examinations will
be held. It will last until January 4. A great
many students have already left town, having
passed their examinations, and it is estimated
that during the holidays the population of
Berkeley will be decreased by 2CCO.

BERKELEY, Dec. 15. â Neither
President Wheeler nor the members
of the committee having in charge the
arrangements for an exhibit of the
works of the University of California
have received any reply from tne of
ficials of the St. Louis World's Exposi
tion in regard to the application for
more space in the N Educational build
ing.
Failing to receive a reply to the
telegram of inquiry sent ten days ago,
President Wheeler sent another tele
gram yesterday to ask what disposi
tion was intended of the university's
previous application, but up to a late
hour to-night no word had been re
ceived from St. Louis.
President Wheeler and the members
of the committee, are puzzled at the
silence of the exposition* officials and
do not know whether ,it' means that
they intend to ignore California's re
quest altogether or are really waiting
until a suitable space is found before
replying. At any rate the delay is
disconcerting and if it goes on much
longer it may be necessary to give up
the idea of a university exhibit entire
ly. The time in which a collection
could be gathered is now rather short
and the delay that has already been
sustained will make necessary com
plete, rearrangement of the plans the
committee had already tentatively
adopted.
Professor E. J. "Wickson, chairman
of the university's committee, says
that the university ought to have at
least twice the space allotted .to any
high school on account of its immense
importance. If this is not given he
thinks it will be useless to attempt to
make a showing.
Time for Making Exhibit Growing
Short and the Project May
Have to Be Abandoned.

self in the young son and to-day re
ceived a letter from the murderess re
questing her to call at the County Jail
and also to come fortified with recom

Mclnerny visited Justice of the Peace
F. S. Cone this afternoon and asked
the magistrate for letters vouching for
the responsibility of himself and his
sister to furnish the Ross boy with a
comfortable home and give him kind
treatment. Justice Cone referred the
petitioner to Superior Judge John Ells
worth. Mclnerny is an old-time resi-'
dent of Alameda and is engaged in the
business of distributing bills. Some
years ago he obtained possession of a
boy 11 years of age and because it was
alleged that he treated the lad harshly
and failed to supply him with the ncc- (
essaries of life the little fellow was
taken from him at the instance of a
local society and placed in St. Vincent's,
Orphan Asylum at San Rafael.

Frank Avery, a lumber tallyman for
the Southern Pacific Company, was
killed at 5:30 this afternoon at First
and Cedar streets by either the Ala
meda local train or a switch engine.
Avery was .. on his way home from
work and was crossing the First-street
railroad tracks when he was struck.
Railroad men found Avery dying by
the tracks. He was removed to the
receiving hospital, but died on the way.
His body was taken to the,morgue.
Two minutes before the accident oc
curred Avery had left a group of fel
low employes near the machine shops
at the West Oakland railroad yards
and had started to cross the tracks at
Cedar street, on his way out of the
yards. The railroad people were not
sure whether the train or a switch en
gine had hit Avery.
Examination showed that Avery's
skull had been fractured, his right arm
and right leg broken and his right
hand severed at the wrist.' There were
also internal injuries.
Avery has been in the railroad's em
ploy for twenty years. He was about
55 years old. His wife and two children
are in Seattle. A son is in the law
department of the Northern Pacific
Railroad in that city. A brother, A.
W. Avery, is a Southern Pacific Com
pany passenger conductor. The dead
man resided at 726 Fifteenth street.

Plucky little Laura Jorgcnsen, \Z
years old. compelled two burly tramps
to surrender the money they tad stolen
from the till in Mrs. William Ma3on s
bakery at 5867 San Pablo avenue this
morning.
The girl, who Is employed in the shop,
came upon the unwelcome callers just
as they had grabbed the contents of
the money drawer. With a coolness
and presence of mind that would have
done credit to much older heads the
child demanded that the thieves yield
their plunder. Miss Jorgerwen ran to
the front door, blocked the way out
and repeated her orders.
So unexpected was the firm jttand of
the youthful shopkeeper that it took
the pair off their guard and they sim
ply surrendered to the show of moral
if not superior physical force.
With an oath one of the men who
had the money* dropped a bunch of
small coins he had in his hands back
Into the till and then the child stepped
aside, allowing the thieves to depart.
Telling the story of her adventure
the little miss said:
"Two men came in the store at 7:30
o'clock this morning, shortly after we
had opened. They asked for a loaf of
bread. "While they were talking about
the price I was called out of the store
by a telephone ring. When I got back
I saw the men at the till and one of
them had his hands full of money. I
ran out to the door and ordered them
to put the money back.
" 'If you don't I shall have you ar
rested.' I said to them.
"One said, 'I guess you had better
put It back. Bill,' and then he did.
As soon as that was Clone the men
ran away. as fast as they could. They
got only a dollar."
The police were notified, but no trace
of the thieves was found. Little Miss
Jorgensen resides with her father,
Christian Jorgensen, at 1173 Twenty
third avenue.

Judge Trask has rendered a decision in
the casfe of the California Citrus Union
against three orange growers who had
signed contracts to- market their crop
through the union and then sought to
sell independent of the organization.
Judge Trask decides that individual
growers of citrus fruits who have
agreed to sell their products to the
California Citrus Union can repudiate
their contracts, which are held to be
practically void because the terms cf
agreement are not set forth fully.
Judge Trask, in rendering his decision,
laid down a principle relating to the
abuse of injunction proceedings and as
signs for part reason of denying plain
tiff's petitton that:
"Injunctions are not granted in cases
where pecuniary compensation would
afford adequate relief; nor to prevent
a breach of contract the performance
of which would not be specifically En
forced. In either of " these cases the
injured party Is left to his remedy at
law for damages."

VALLEJO, Dec. 15.â Cor siderable
mystery surrounds the death of a child
whose parents have been refused a
burial permit.
The dead child was the three-year
old girl of a family named Nicols, liv
ing on the Old Point road between
Vallejo and Benicia. During its sick
ness the child was attended by an os
teopathic physician. A physician of the
regular school was called in, but when
he arrived the child was dead. After
his return to this city the local health
official refused to grant a permit for
burial and reported the case to the
State Board of Health for instructions.
Neither the local physician nor the
health officer will make any statement
regarding the matter to explain why a
burial permit was refused.
union not to be recognized and no dis
crimination against union men.
Since the end of the last strike, how
ever, the industries of the county have
i remained somewhat shaky, as more
trouble has continually been feared.
On November 13 a walk out occurred
at the South Eureka mine situated at
: Sutter Creek and the mine was subse
quently closed. The Sutter Creek
Miners' Union took up the cause of the
miners of the South Eureka and de
clared a strike against that mine, de
manding the reinstatement of three
men or a sufficient reason why they
were at that particular time dis
charged.
At the special meeting of the Miners'
Union, held soon after the walkout,
the strike was formally declared on
the South Eureka and has since re
mained in effect. In accordance with
the agreement made between the mine
operators and employes on the settle
ment of the strike last April there was
to be no recognition of the union on
the part of the errfployers. Consequent
ly Superintendent Moore has refused to
treat with the union in any manner
whatever. He has offered the men the
opportunity to return to work indi
vidually, but will not hire them as a
union. For four weeks the situation
has remained the same, while all' the;
mines of the county and every other
industry as well have been on a very
weak foundation. Gold remains -at a
value of a little over $19 per ounce and
since the mine operators of the moth
er lode mines cannot increase the value
of their product, the expenses neces
sary ta operate the mines cannot be in
creased.
For several days past James H. Tib
bits, ex-Assemblyman from Amador
County and an old resident of Sutter
Creek has been trying to bring about
a settlement of the strike.' Mr. Tib
bits has spent his life in the county
and is well known. Recently he has
been conducting a smelting works in
Texas, but at this particular time Is
in Sutter Creek on a visit. He will be
remembered as one of the mediators
between the mine operators and miners
in the famous Keswick strike of Shasta
County. It is well understood to-night
that Mr. Tibbits Is meeting -with suc
cess In getting the strike declared off.

SPOKAXE, Dec. 15.â With a posse
hot upon his trail Joe Dilio, the fugitive
Italian murderer, left the road this
morning and took refuge in the brush
near Valley, Wash. Here he was dis
covered shortly after daylight.
As the posse advanced through the
brush Dilio, lying behind a log, raised
his head and'polnted a revolver at his
pursuers. The posse waited for no
further warning, but opened fire, rid
dling him with rifle bullets. Death
was instantaneous.
Dilio and Antonio Del Vecchio were
partners In a grocery and saloon In
Spokane. Saturday they quarreled.
Dilio 6hot Del Vecchio, mortally wound
ing him. Then Dilio fled. I^ast night
a mysterious Italian entered F. *W.
Weatherwax's hotel at Valley, forty,
miles north of Spokane. He came in
by the back door, kept his hat over his
eyes and turned his back on other peo
ple. When he went to his room he
locked the door and barricaded it with
his bed. Weatherwax, who is a con
stable, was convinced he was Dilio, but
tried to get definite facts from Spo
kane before arresting him. Weather
wax put his cot outside Dllio's door lest
the man should escape.
About 4 o'clock this morning Dilio
left the hotel. He went to a mill about
a mile and a half away, where he
bought breakfast and an overcoat.
Then he started down the road. Mean
while the constable got orders from
Spokane to arrest him. A posse of six
men, with two dogs, tracked Dilio
through the snow into the brush.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec 15.â A decision
upon a unique point by Judge Bellinger
of the Federal court has resulted in
the clearing of Frank â¢Wlnnlshut, the
Indian accused of murdering ! Officer
Pelatt on the Warm Spring* reserva
tion. The jury was instructed to return
a verdict of not guilty. \
No parallel to the point rffsed by the
defense could be found in the legal rec
ords. The point at issue was whether
a person could be held guilty of taking
the life of another by an Involuntary
act,, the same being an '. '. unintentional
reflex of another act performed In an
'attempt- to escape arrest. \
Winriishut became intoxicated at the
Indian. agency. He was racing about
on a horse, when two Indian officers
undertook to , arrest him. Policeman
Abraham seized the reirisof the bridle.
.Pelatt stepped up ., to 'â¢'. the horse's
haunches. Wlnnlshut objected to being
arrested and, : drawing a' kn' , at
tempted to cut the' reins, to' release his
horse. Abraham threw a handkerchief
about the neck of Winnishut and'trted
to drag him fromthe horse. The hand
kerchief, tore and the sudden release
caused Winnishut to. rebound back
ward in" the F3ddle, throwing him off.
The â¢ momentum of.' his- body threw his
hands backward and the knife inflicted
a. mortal v/ound upon Pelatt, who was
back of Winnishut.

i v Greatest in the World eajjJohn Dillon, a banker at Geary, owns
a medal alleged to be one of the eight
given by George Washington to eight
Arapahoe Indian chiefs in 17S9. The
medal is nearly two and a half inches
In diameter and made of unalloyed
silver. It was given to Dillon by an
Arapahoe chief, Jock Bull Bear, who
declared . that it was given originally,
to his grandfather, White Owl, by
Washington and transmitted by White
Owl to his son of the same name, who
was the uncle of Jock Bull Bear and
from whom Bull Bear received it.
On one side is the head of Washing
ton, encircled by the words, "George
Washington, the Father of His Coun
try." . Below is the date, "1789.'' On
the other side are two olive branches
inclosing two clasped hands with the
date, "17S9," and two crossed pipes be
neath. In the outer margin at the top
is the word "Friendship" with six stars
on each separating it from the words,
"The Pipe of Peace," in the outer mar
gin, at the bottom of the medal. * The
thirteenth Ptar is immediately beneath
Â».hc word "Friendship."
The story of the medal as told to Mr.
Dillon is that the Arapahoe tribe was
in , camp at Colorado Springs in 178S
when eight chiefs left on horseback
for Washington. They made the trip
successfully and returned in njnc
months from the da-y of departure. Mr.
Dillon does not know the value of the
medal, but has refused all ' offers for
It;? purchase. â Kansas City Journal. '

the words in the language in complete
ness does the same. The particular
dictionary referred to gives no less than
17,000 new terms or' new meanings of
old words! A large number of new
terms in the language always come
from scientific vocabularies. There is
also a considerable addition through
the adoption or modification of foreign

George B. Young followed on behalf
of the securities company. Young con
tended that the transfer of the stock
of the railroad companies to the secu
rities company had been entirely free
from the features which had operated
to throw discredit upon the formation
of trusts. The transaction was noth
ing more than a transfer of property.
"We are proceeding upon the theory,"
he said, "that an out and out sale was
made, and unless the court is prepared
to hold that Congress should exercise
exclusive control of all transfers of
transportation agencies engaged in in
terstate commerce we fail to see how
this transaction can'be"lie!d to become
a combination in restraint of trade or
agairst the anti-trust law."
"It is bad enough." he said, "to bring
the entire railroad facilities of an im
portant section of the country under
monopolistic control, but when to the
power to fix charges for transportation
you add the creation of scores of .mil
lions of flat stock upon which those
charges are expected to pay jJlvidends
you impose an unjustifiable burden up
on the people and exact too high a price
for a successful evasion of the law..
"While it may be true that the re
capitalization of these companies was
based upon existing market values for
their stock, yet existing market values
rested at that time upon total forgetful
ness of the fact that the progress of
material prosperity is not continuous
and that those values were lifted. upon
the v.lngs of an optimism that had con
verted into stock and stock values all
the prosperity in sight, as well as all
hopes and expectations of many future
years.
"This thing was done when men who
have been regarded as wise men and
safe men lost their hold upon their
judgment and failed to withstand the
temptation to gather for their instant
personal advantage the fruits which,
conserved, would have Iastea many
year? and been furnished many people.
'"The question in this case is not
whether Congress can regulate and has
regulated State corporations or the
ownership of their capital stork] The
question is: Can the owners of such
capital utook regulate interstate com
merce?"
YOUNG DEFENDS THE MERGEU.
Knox declared that Morgan and Hill
had the power to suppress competition
between these two roads when they
held the control of the majority of the
stock of the two. He asserted that they
executed that power and actually sup
pressed and destroyed competition be
tween them the moment they parted
with the legal title to their segregated
holdings and vested them in the North
ern Securities Company.
SCY)RES ri.VAXCIAI; KINGS.
Knox then discussed the end accom
plished by the merger of the railroad
interests, saying:
"The device resorted to in this case,
if sustained, defeats the policy of the
law, as it accomplished all and more
in the way of effectual destruction of
competition than was accomplished in
the trans-Missouri and joint traffic
cases. "You may call it a^merger, a
combination, a poo!, a conspiracy, a
consolidation. \ a contract, a securities
company, or what you like. The thing
it accomplishes is not varied by a var
iation In name or manner of bringing
it about."
WASHINGTON*. Dec. 15.â Attorney-
General Knox resumed his argument
in the Northern Securities case in the
United States Supreme Court to-day.
He declared that by the union of the
Northern Pacific and Great Northern
Reihvay Companies, .two competing
interstate railroads had been brought
irto such relations that their independ^
ence as competitive factors in inter
state commerce was destroyed. The
thing that had been done was declared
illegai. he said, when brought about by
the methods pursued in the Joint traf
fic and trans-Missouri cases. These
Â¦were cases of contracts or agreements
between independent and competing
lines of railroad for the regulation of
traffic charges. The Government
charged that these argeements re
strained interstate commerce, and the
Supreme Court sustained that conten
tion.

IN A BOX CAR
WASHINGTON. Dec. 15.â In the
; Genera! Wood case to-day Major J. E.
Runcie was the first witness. State
ments made by Ray Stannard Baker,
concerning the article reflecting upon
the administration of Major General
Brooke made it necessary for the re
call of Major Runcie.' He was asked a
number of questions concerning the
origin of the article in question and
stood by his former testimony, to the
eect that General Wood had knowl
edge of -the story and that it was pre
pared practically at his suggestion and
dictation.
The next witness was General George
\ R. Burton, inspector general of the
army. He occupied the position of In
i spector general in Cuba under the ad
ministration of General Wood as Gov
ernor General, and it was he who dis
1 covered the postal frauds. He was
called to give the date of that discov
ery and also the date on which Gen
eral Wood made the order revising tne
judicial 6ystem of Cuba for the admis
sion of ex parte testimony. General
Burton said that the discovery of the
postal frauds was made in April, 1900,
,and that it was two weeks or more
later when the order was issued by-
General Wood changing the jurisdic
tion and powers of the court.
Alexis E. Frye, formerly Superin
tendent of Public Instruction in Cuba,
told the committee that the schools of
Cuba were organized under laws issued
by General Brooke and that an order
making a cut in salaries of teachers
was issued by General Wood. He de
clared that there had been a breach of
faith on the part of General Wood
when he interfered with the efficiency
of the schools. He asserted that Gen
eral Wood was untruthful in many
matters affecting public affairs.

DIETRICH CASE
TO BE RUSHED
CONNELLSVILLE, Pa., Dec. 16.â A
reduction in wages averaging 17 per
cent, and affecting 30,000 men in the
Connellsville Â« coke regions, was an
nounced to-day/ The H. C. Frick Coke
Company takes* the initiative in this,
the first reduction since the great strike
of the early nineties, and to-day post
ed notices at all of its plants announc
ing the reductions.
The new rate is somewhat above the
basis of the former $2 coke; scale and
indicates that the Frick company in
tends ,to make a stand for something
like a $2 minimum price for furnace
coke,,", notwithstanding, the fact that
many sales have been . reported below
that figure. Simultaneously with the
announcement of a reduction in wages
the Union Supply Company, the owner
of all the company stores at the Frick
and allied companies, announced a
general cut in the price of goods.
GIRL ACCUSED
OF KIDNAPING
HELENA, Mont., Dec. 15.â The tak
ing cf testimony in the case of Isaac
Gravelle, charged with -sending letters
to the Northern Pacific officials'' de
manding money for immunity from dy
namite outrages, began to-day. Among
the witnesses was Warden of the Peni
tentiary Conley, who testified to Gra
velle having served two terms in the
penitenti{%^. The theory of the prose
cution is that three of the threatening
letters received by the railroad officials
wore, written in the penitentiary by the
cellmate of Gravelle, a man named
Harvey Whltton, who is serving an
eighty-year sentence for murder. Con
ley identified two of the threatening
letters as being in the handwriting of
Whittori. The paper they were written
on is sent out by a school ot corre
spondence and was identified by a pe
culiar water mark. One of the letters
identified was, addressed to the board
of directors of the road and was dated
July 16, 1903, the day Gravelle was re
leased from prison. It was the first
letter, making a demand for $25,000..
The second, was without date and'di
rected the railroad company how to
deliver the money and what the denom
inations were to be.
There are eighty witnesses in at
tendance on the trial and it will con
sume about two weeks.
The importance of finding these
bodies in scarlet fever, Dr. Mallory
said, lay in the fact that up to the
present time absolutely nothing has
been known in* regard to the cause of
the disease.
BOSTON, Dec. 15.â At a meeting of
the Boston Society of Medical Science
to-night Dr. F. B. Mallory, associate
professor of pathology in the Harvard
Medical School, explained in detail his
discovery of the scarlet fever germ.
He said that in the skin of four vic
tims of the disease who died in the.
eruptive stage, he found a series of
bodies which close'y resembled the va
rious development stages of a proto
zoan. In the course of his paper Dr;
Mallory said:
"While manv of the common infec
tious diseases are due to bacteria, the
lowest form of vegetable life, a certain
number are due to protozoa, the lowest
form of animal life. Of the latter dis
eases the best known and the most
studied are the malarial fevers, of
which three distinct varieties are rec
ognized. In these malarial diseases
the protozoa, or hemosphoridias, live
arid develop in the blood. Here they
pass through, however, only a sexual
development. If these micro-organisms
in the human blood are sucked up
by a certain group of mosquitoes they
then pass through, in the stomach of
the mosquito, their sexual develop
ment and are ready after a certain
length of time to infect other persons
when transferred to their blood by the
bite of the infected mosquito. *
"The bodies found in scarlet fever re
semble the different stages of the sex
ual development of the malarial organ-,
ism, but do not live in the blood. In
stead they live in the epithelial cells of
the skin and tongue, between these
cells and in the superficial lymph ves
sels and spaces of the corium. Like
the malarial. parasites they multiply by
forming segmenting bodies, or ro
settes. These rosettes are about one
third larger than the malarial rosettes
and the number of- segments would
seem to be about twice as many.
"Whether sexual development occurs as
with malarial micro-organism could
not be determined." ' .'- '

San Francisco Store, Cor. Geary and Stockton Sta.
There are 60 Regal Stores â 20 of them in Greater New
York, where the styles originate. The new styles arc on sale in
our San Francisco store at the same time as in the New York
stores.. . .Other dealers, get the same styles a year later.
bare % facts about Regal Shoes
are what we want you to know.
The trouble is that the facts are so
remarkable you find them hard to
believe. Jt does seem strange that nobody else can make
â¢and sell shoes equal to Regals at $3.50. Strange because
Regal, methods are as open as daylight. Any shoe
manufacturer could do as well for you if he followed the
Regal system. The secret of Regal success is really no
secret at all. It is simply the elimination of all superflu-
ous handlings and profits. We are tanners. We are
manufacturers. We are retailers. We sell our product
direct to the 'wearer. One sale â one profit.
The ordinary method is this: The tanner must have
a profit on the hides he sells through a commission
broker, who must also- have a profit. He sells to the
manufacturer, who sells to the jobber, who sells to the
retailer, who adds- thirty or forty per cent, profit to the
four profits already added, and by the time you get the
shoes your money pays for about $3 of profit and $3
worth of shoes.
If anybody can tell us how the shoes have been
improved by all this handling, and by all these profits, we
would like to have him do it.
There isn't over $1.75 worth of leather in the
best pair of shoes that ever came down street. One
dollar is enough for the making by the best modern
methods. Seventy -five cents for one handling and one.
profit is. enough to satisfy us.
And that is the way you get $6 shoes for $3.50.
We sell direct from tannery to wearer, and in no
other way, and no other maker sells direct exclu-
sively. That is one reason why you cannot get Regal
quality and Regal price anywhere but in the Regal
stores.

smiths of that city have been locked
out by prominent firms. The council
will confer with the firms with the ob
ject of reinstating the men and If they
cannot accomplish the result In this
way a strike may result.
A new law has been recently passed
by the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters requiring that every man
that holds an office in any branch of
the Teamsters' Union must be a work
ing member. This means that if th.2
new law is put into effect In this city
Michael Casey, president of the local
teamsters' .organization, will have to
resign, as he is no longer a working
teamster, but a political office holder."
The local teamsters are opposed .to
this new law and all of them are loyal
to Casey and want him to remain as
head of the organization. They will de
fer action tHUnext July, when the in
ternational . brotherhood holds another
session. Five delegates will be . sent
from the nnion in this city and they
will endeavor to have the new law re-

Mrs. Louis Mervin llaus, wife of
Colonel Maus, delivered a most inter
esting lecture in the First Presbyterian
Church Sunday school room last^night
on the Philippines, China and Japan.
Mrs. Maus,. was aided by remarkably
interesting stereopticon views consist-
Ing of pictures taken by herself and
soldiers of the United States army.
Many, new things were told about the
Philippine Islands. The material bet
terment of the Filipinos under the
beneficent rule of the United States,
the advancement in gducatipn and the
growth of the Presbyterian church In
the Philippines and army were de
scriptively told.
Pictures of grand old churches and
pictures of the native huts proved a
strong contrast and stories of the new
civilization were applauded.
Mrs. Maus showed views of Peking
and of the throne room of the Empress
of China and gave a most pleasant
glimpse Into the country of the Mikado.
At the conclusion of the lecture Mrs.
Maus was the recipient of hearty ap
plause and a vote of thanks for the
very fine and instructive illustrations
of the three countries.
The lantern was directed by J. F.
Leicester, who made a speech In
behalf of tMfe Filipino children, who
were, he said, eager to learn and took
advantage of the opportunities offered
them. He therefore asked the con
tinued support of members of the Pres
byterian church for a cause which he
said would In after years prove a bless
ing to the recipients of its bounty.
Interlocutory decrees of divorce were
granted to Marguerite Hunt from Ar
chibald Hunt for desertion, Maria Trol
ler from Herman Trpller for cruelty,
Ellas Lubronz from Annie Lubronz for
desertion. Myrtle B. Powenj from
Henry D. Powers for cruelty and Daisy
E. Moore from Harry J. Moore for de
sertion.
Hugh S. Carpenter, manager of the
Alameda branch offices of the Pacific
States and Sunset Telephone Com
panies. Is being sued for divorce by
Ruth F. Carpenter, to whom he was
mart-led at Alameda In 1894. She
charges that since 1896 he has been a
brutal husband, alleging that he has
frequently^ struck her and cursed her
and that he once flourished a pistol In
her face. She also says that he "has
maliciously lied about her. Mrs. Car
penter's maiden name is Seymour and
she asks for a divorce, permission to
resume it and 550 a month alimony.
Robert Jones wants a divorce from
Nellie Jones on the ground of deser
tion, alleging in his complaint that
she left him without any cause or rea
son just three months after she be
came his wife. They .were married
in September of last year. Desertion
Is also alleged in' the suit for divorce
brought by Meta Lages against C.
Lages. Infidenity is the ground upon
which David Truff elli is suing Jennie
Truffelli. John F. Brigman. better
known as J. \V. Critesj the jockey, is
the defendant in the divorce suit
brought by Hattie M. Brigman. to
whom he was married at San Rafael in
November of last year. She charges
neglect. Ethel -J. Robinson, who wag
married to Oliver P. Robinson at Reno
in April, 1S02, is seeking a divorce for
cruelty.
Harry E. Noland. defendant in a suit
for divorce brought by Hattie A. No
land, ha^s led a very strenuous exist
ence for the last three years. If the
allegations made by him In his cross
complaint are to be believed. He says
that from the unlucky day in Febru
ary, 1900, when he, a mere lad of 18,
succumbed to the blandishments of
Hattie. who, he says, is many years
hig senior, and consented to become
her husband, his peaceful moments
have been few and far between. It was
all her fault, too, says Harry, notwith
standing that his wife, in her com
plaint, alleges that he has been a cruel
and brutal spouse. He denies all her
charges and says that at various times
during the last three years she has
amused herself at his expense by pull
ing his whiskers, punching him In the
eye, cursing him. hurling beer bottles
at him and otherwise behaving In a
manner that gave him sorrow, pain
and a feeling of disappointment and
misery. Her principal amusement, he
says, was throwing her footwear at
him. He charges that when he least
expected It she would puLL from her
feet her shoe or slipper and hurl it at
him with great violence and "deadly
accuracy." He winds up his tale by
asking for a divorce and the custody
of their two children, a boy and a
girl.
Herman Hermensen of the Goodfel-
Icw's Grotto also resigned from the
association because he could not agree
to certain demands made by that body.
In an interview last evening he
etated that he intended to open his
business as quickly as he could. He
would employ union and . non-union
help and pay union wages. He further
stated that he would offer employment
to the men and women who have al
ready worked for him. He Eays he
does not court a boycott, but if there
is to be one. he will stand it.
M. Johnson, who had been chairman
of the executive committee of the as
sociation, and who bore the brunt of
the attack during the present struggle,
favored the "open house," and declared
Y.f- would not sign the agreement un
less he and his fellow members were
granted that privilege. The majority
of the association was opposed to Mr.
Johnson and he immediately resigned
from the association. He appealed to
the members to accept his resignation,
otherwise they might have to expel
him for not abiding by the will of
the majority. A vote was taken and
â¢he members refused to accept the res
:gr.ation. Upon reconsideration, how
ever, it was accented and Mr. Johnson
retired.
Immediately upon receipt of the let
ter a special meeting of the associa
tion was tailed and the agreement al
luded to was taken up and discussed.
A committee consisting of Max Wiesen
hutter, I. Cuensn. E. Hesse and J. J.
Olson was appointed by the association
to meet with committees from the
Â¦Waiters' and Cooks' unions.
The first objection the members of
the association had was the entrance
into an agreement with Cooks'
Union. .No. 110. The second objection
was to the â¢'walking delegate." The
association is opposed to the "walking
delegate" coming into the places of its
members and creating trouble. Prob
? bljr the most serious objection is to
that portion of the agreement which
relates to "closed houses."
This specifies that the restaurants
must employ union men and women
and provides for their wages and hours
of work. Various members argued
that the restaurants of this city were
entitled to an "open house" agreement.
This entitles them to employ union and
non-union help. Such places as Zln
kands, Techau's, the Louvre and the
Grotto are permitted to employ union
and non-union help. There seemed to
be a willingness on the part of some of
the members to accede to the demands
of the unions and have "closed houses."
JOHXSOX RESIGNS.
Further, that the Restaurant Keepers'- Asso
ciation ehall take up the consideration of the
r.ew agreement with the union* for the year
1W4 not later then Dec-ember 36. 1903. We
have appointed our committee and await your
imn-.ediate reply
OUMON T. X. LEDWITH. President.
MKCTING IS CALLED.
As was stated in the Call yesterday,
the lockout brought about by the
Restaurant Keer>ers' Association is no
longer in effect. As quickly as the eat
ing houses that have been closed can
open their places for business, they will
do so. The meeting of committees
from the association and the unions
Monday night aided materially in part
ly bringing about a settlement of the
differences between the proprietors and
their help.
The following letter was sent to the
association yesterday and is self
explanatory:
To the Restaurant Keeperts' Association â Dear
F!rÂ»- W> agrw that we will replace as far a*
possito!* the crews of the Central restaurant and
the TlvoU cafe, provided that a!l Restaurant
Keepers' Association houFe* will open up Ef
union houses. Any restaurant opening up as a
ncn-unlon or En oren-fhop houÂ«e will net be
protected by the Restaurant Keepers' Assocta
t.on.
The man is described as being tall
and slightly built. He wore a black
suit.
Miss Morris almost collapsed and it
was some time before she regained her
strength sufficiently to be able to pro
ceed on her \\*ay.
Speaking of the outrage, committed
on one of the city's most frequented
streets, Miss Morris said to a repre
sentative of the v fcall:
"I was on my 'way to see some mem
bers of my family and chose Van Ness
avenue, thinking that It was perfectly
safe. I cannot explain the terror that
seized me^ when the man grasped me,
and when he* murmured something I
could not make out and followed that
up with a threat to smash me to the
ground I feared for my life. It Is well
I had the presence of mind left me to
scream or there is no telling what my
fate would have been.
r "I never saw the man before. His ac
tions would indicate that he was a
madman. It is terrible that such an
outrage should happen in the city and
especially on a thoroughfare as public
as Van Ness Avenue." ,
The shrieks of a young girl and the
threats of a desperate man drew the
attention of pedestrians on Van Ness
avenue last night, and only the timely
arrival of assistance saved a young
woman from possible serious injury at
the. hands of an unknown ruffian.
Miss Lorette Morris, 17 years of age.
left 2334 Franklin street, where she had
been engaged as a domestic, to visit
some members of her family on Gcragh
street about 7:30 o'clock. She turned
into Van Ness avenue, .thinking that
she would be more secure .walking
alone on that thoroughfare than if she
had gone on the. more lonely street.
On reaching Sutter street Miss Morris
noticed some one following her. ' Im
mediately opposite St. Dunstan's a
man grabbed her by the shoulder and,
turning round, Miss Morris saw that
she was. in the clutch of a desperate
looking man. He murmured a few
words and bending over the terrified
girl said: "I will smash you to the
ground." ;
Miss Morris screamed for aid and
on the approach of a man who was at
tracted by the screams the girl's as
sailant ran swiftly across the street
and disappeared down Walnut avenue.
I Mrs. Clarke stated yesterday that the
! reason she had her marriage license
sent tp McLaughlin's offices -was that
she did not desire that her husband
: should get control of the document,
j which he might have had if the license
! had been mailed to the Lick House.
L Mrs. Clarke was obliged to borrow a
: small sum of money yesterday from a
friend. She stated yesterday that sÂ«he
would take legal steps to compel
Clarke to support her and that she
would find the means to get competent
i legal aid.
At that time she informed her friend
that "Dr." McLaughlin had secured all
her money and that she was practically
without means.
In July last the "Sweet Pea Girl"
went East with "Dr." McLaughlin and
it is claimed that the woman paid the
expenses of the trip. They returned to
this city anJ for the last few months
she has been seen constantly with Mc-
Laughlin. A few nights ago she spoke
to a friend and told him that Mc-
Laughlin seemed to exert a strange in
fluence over her and that she coyld not
get away from his seeming hypnotic
power.
Mrs. Bower, or the "Sweet Pea Girl,"
was warned by some friends not tj
have anything to do with McLaughlin,
but she ignored the warnings. The
woman's friends say that McLaughlin
benefited to a great extent financially
on account of his friendship with Mrs.
Bower, or Mrs. Clarke, as she now is.
\VEXT WITH McLAUGHLIX.
"Dr." McLaughlin first met the
"Sweet Pea Girl" when she returned
from Nome with considerable means.
McLaughlin is known to the police and
detective agencies of many cities, who
have investigated his record.
Clarke and his friends then left the
apartment and proceeded uptown to an
apartment-house, where every care
was taken to keep him secluded from
inquiry.
Through the scandal that has .at
tached to Clarke's sudden wedding to
the "Sweet Pea Girl" it has developed
that "Dr." Ivan McLaughlin, to whose
offices in the Starr-King building Mrs.
Clarke requested that her marriage
certificate be sent by the minister who
married the couple, is the very intimate
friend of Mrs. Clarke.
"I have no money whatever," said
Mrs. Clarke, and the tears glistened In
her eyes as she faced her husband.
"That is none of my business," re
plied Clarke, "and I don't want to have
anything more to do with you." .
E. K. Clarke, the well-known club
man whese sensational midnight mar
riage last Saturday to Mrs. Rosalind
Bower, the "Sweet Pea Girl," who fig
ured in the trial of Durrant, the noto
rious murderer, yesterday informed his
bride of a few days that he no longer
desired to have anything to do with
her.
The scene took place at the Lick
House, where Clarke and his fvife re
paired after their wedding. Clarke's
relatives, who succeeded in getting
him away from his wife on Monday,
kept him secluded at an uptown hotel
until yesterday.
Shortly before noon yesterday
Clarke, with his brother-in-law and an
attorney, visited the rooms at the Lick
House, where Mrs. Clarke received
them.
"We have called for the rest of Mr.
Clarke's effects," said the attorney. *
"If he wants them," replied Mrs.
Clarke, "let him ask me for -them. I
decline to deal with you."
"Yes." said Clarke to his bride, "I
want the rest of my things."
"Well, here they are," answered his
wife, and she scornfully placed some of.
her husband's clothes on a table.

The target practice at the Presidio
was interfered with yesterday by the
hazy weather, and after a little firing
from the mortar batteries it was de
cided to discontinue the work until to

might clear away sufficiently to enable
the gunners to get fair aim at the tar-
The Fifteenth Infantry crossed bats
yesterday afternoon with the Ninth
Cavalry, the former" winning. Score,
IT to 5. The game was spirited and
was witnessed by about 1000 people,
among whom were the officers of the
post, many enlisted men and a lot of
people from town. To-day the Fif
teenth Infantry will play the . Thir

ground. To-morrow, in all probability,
the Fifteenth will have a chance to
show its dexterity witti the crack Pre

Among those who arrived from the
Philippines yesterday and who are

I'antry, and James M. Lawrence, an
army veterinary surgeon.
BASEBALL GAMES.
Captain O'Connell was the first man
with his company to land in Cuba, ro
ing with the famous Gussie expedition.
He landed in the presence of a regi
ment of Spaniards with his little band
of fifty men. The object of the daring
act â the landing of the Cuban officers â
was successfully accomplished. His
little band drew the first Spanish blood
in that war, killing the commanding
officer of the Spanish troops and sev
eral of his men, and embarked on board
the Gussie without losing a man.
After that action Captain O'Connell
landed in Cuba with General Shafter's
Fifth Corps and on July 1 partici
pated in the battle of El Caney. The
same day his son, Lieutenant O'Con
nell, was engaged In the battle of San
Juan. Lieutenant O'Connell is now
Ccptain O'Connell of this city, and nas
neen active service in the Philippine
Islands. After his return from Cuba
Captain O'Connell was promoted to be
colonel of the Thirtieth Infantry. He
is very glad to be back in San Fran
cisco to meet his old friends of many
vears' standing.
" Colonel O'Connell, as a captain,
! marched out of the Presidio on April
'Â¦Â¦Â¦ 22. 1S98, to go to Cuba. San Francisco
; turned out to do the First Infantry
honor, for it regarded the First as a
; California regiment, it having been sta
j tioned in this city for about fourteen
' years under General Shafter.
Van Ness avenue and Market street
; were literally strewn with flowers for
this regiment, the oldest in the United
, States service.
FIKST ON* CUBAX SOIL.
The day was one of the most cheer
, less of the season and everything about
| the camp was black and drear, with a
heavy mist falling- to add to the gen
i eral discomfort of landing. Both of
| firers and men were in their khaki
; suits, and they: first attention on arrival
; was given to the building of fires in
j the tents and general precautions to.
I protect the men from the cold blasts
' of the winter dayâ in such distinct va
, riance with the warm and balmy cli
: mate they had just parted from.
Colonel J. J. O'Connell, the command
j ing officer of the Thirtieth, reports a
' fair trip and said his regiment was in
perfect condition, which statement was
; entirely upheld by the appearance of
j the men. Colonel O'Connell is
j well known to the people of San
j Francisco, having served here in the
I First Infantry, the old regiment of
â¢ General Shatter, for about fourteen
| years. He is well known to the Na-
I tional Guard of the State, having been
I its inspector for several years. He
i has many warm friends in San Fran
i cisco and throughout California.
The Thirtieth Infantry is now com
j fcrtably installed in Model Camp at the
| Presidio, which is unquestionably one
j of the best arranged of any of the tem
1 porary camps in the country. It was
in perfect condition to receive the men,
' and they all seemed grreatly pleased
j v.ith the quarters assigrned to them. It
j will probably be a week or more before
I the different companies of the regiment
j will be ready to go to the different
; posts to which they have been as
: signed. In the meantime they will be
j fully equipped with uniforms suitable
I to the rigorous climate into which they
; are going. They had a good taste of
| bad weather yesterday though.

DO NOT WEAR A LONG FACE.
It Is a Great Handicap In All Busi-
ness ana Social Relations.
The man -who looks as if he had lost
his last friend is In no danger of being
crushed by the jam of new onss un-
less he "cheers up." People are not
going out of their way nowadays to
associate with the man of mournful and
melancholy appearance. They are
afraid he will tell them his troubles
and they steer clear of him, as they all
have plenty of their own.
The most universal cause of the for-
lorn and hopeless appearance to-day Is
dyspepsia. - It unfits a man for every
duty of life and causes him to become
despondent and gloomy and necessarily
his looks do- not belie his feelings. He (
appears cast down and dejected -and
becomes a burden to himself and hu-
manity In general.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are the
dyspeptic's certain relief. They do the
work that his stomach Is unai>le to
do and by relieving that organ of its
burdens permit it to regain its health
and strength and again become active
and useful In its functions. They con-
tain all the essential ingredients that
enter into the digestive fluids and se-
cretions of the stomach and they act-
ually take ud the work and do it just
as a healthy, sound stomach would.
By this means a man can go right
ahead with h!s work and eat enough
to keep him in proper working condi-
tion. His system is not deprived of
its necessary nourishment as it is in
the case of the "starvation cure" or
the employment of some of the first
class chicken foods now on the market.
Starvation, even if it were a good thing-,
could not be continued long enough to
effect a cure: for a disordered and
worn out stomach is not going to be-
come strong and healthy in two or
I three davs.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets act nat-
j urally because they contain natural di-
gestives. The principal component
parts are aseptic pepsin, malt diastase
and other ingredients with like proper-
j ties that do the work regardless of the
condition of the stomach. There Is no
unnatural or violent disturbance of the
digestive organs as the result of their
action. In fact, the existence of the
stomach is entirely forgotten as soon
i as they have had time to begin their
! operations. They also possess very ,
[ curative and healing properties and as-
I slst the stomach in getting well, while
relieving it of its work. They perform
the duties of both nurse and physician.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by all druggists at 50 cents a box
and there is very little danger of any
druggist trying to sell you something
else in Its place that is "Just as good."
They are so well established and have
done so much good in the world that
their name has become a household
word: so the usual warning. "Accept
no substitute." is unnecessary in the
case of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.

WILLIAM TELLâ C. H. P.. City. Ac

a man as William Tell, who shot An
apple from the head of his son.
This was generally accepted as histor

Aryan races, found with all Its prin

sian poet, Farid Udden Allar; in the
Icelandic Thldreksaga: in the works of

Imagination, and that a bailiff of that*
name did not exist at the time Tell Is

to have shot the apple from the head
of his son was in 1307.
The exercises are all melodious, and are
interspersed with little "pieces," al
most from the beginning of the book,
which will make It possible for the
pupil to please and entertain his listen
ers, in a simple and unassuming way,
from the very start.
The first thing he must learn in or
der to know how to ncadis the "staff."
Take a piece of paper and with a pencil
draw five lines on it. Now add the
sign of the upper clef (called violin
clef) and explain to him that the sign
means that the piece, or study, as the
case may be, is designed to be played
on the upper half of the pianoâ that Is,
above "middle C," and Is ordinarily
given to the right hand. Until the
pupil becomes accustomed to the upper
clef and is thoroughly familhar with It
do not attempt to teach him the lower,
or baes clef. All his firet exercises and
pieces are intended to be played in the
upper clef, with both hands.
Now draw middle C, according to the
accompanying Illustration, ai.d explain
to the pupil that the note thus drawn,
and the middle C that he has come to
regard as an old friend, and from which
all his scales and exercises start*, are
exactly the same thing.
Now then let the boy draw ths five
lines, put the clef sign at the left side
of the lines and the" "middle C" under
them, copying yours, as ne does so, to
the best of his ability.
When this Is done he nas made a
"sta.fl," and must look !n the beginning

The Arcata Union discerns the fact that While boys

The Chico Record takes high scnopl boys to task who
create unnecessary disturbances in hotels while they are

the youth are naturally hilarious, but the Record would
have them respect the rights of others, Which is surely
also a part of the education of. the good citizen. "There
are some boys," says the Record, -'who when they are
out of sight of the people they know think it is smart to
take on a few glasses of liquor, not that they want- it,

she continues to comply with the law

The State Board of Trade has started a campaign for
the advertisement of the natural resources of California
in which each county is asked simply to display what is
best in it and to co-operate in a plan in which it will be
the- gainer. Any county so blind to its.own prosperity

L.O.S ANGELES has been so uniformly successful in
doing her own booming, and has" among her citi
, . zens so many men who are adepts and enthusiasts
in the art, that her people arc doubtless indifferent to
assistance in that line from the outside, and consequently
may not fully appreciate* the boom that has been given to
them as something in the way of a Christmas gift by
the establishment there of another daily journal of first
class rank. Nevertheless, the appearance' of the Los
Angeles Examiner is a matter of considerable moment
to the southern metropolis and will have a potent in
fluence in increasing its prestige throughout the Union.
Whatever differences of opinion may exist as to the
political adventures of Mr 4 Hearst and his various views
on how to, solve the problems of sociology, there can be
but one' estimate of his ability "to publish a newspaper
that pleases certain elements of the people, and to .that
extent supplies a public need. By his new venture. he fur
nishes Lbs Angeles with a type of journalism it has -lever
had' before, one whose appearance will undoubtedly spur
.the existing journal^ of the city to new efforts and new
enterprises. The city will be the gainer, therefore, in a
double measure.-. It 'is to be hoped the rivalry will never
go beyond the true; limits of journalistic competition, nor
need it ever do so, for the field is big enough for all.

A VOLUMEâ X. T. Z.. Sebastopol,
Cal. As a rule, a volume of a maga

Answers to Queries.
A woman of this city, variously accomplished and sin
gularly versatile in her efforts to murder specimens of
the opposite sex, has failed to prove her insanity and will
be sent to prison for perforating an unfortunate ac
quaintance of hers. This is wise. There are some habits
of the fair sex which even our courts cannot in conscience
afford to encourage. l
At this point it will be well for him
to learn that the number of beats to
be counted a measure are to be found
by reading the sign at the extreme left
of the stanTâ and that the sign for four
counts is either 4-4 (called â¢ four-four
time), or C (called common time).
These two signs mean the same thing
exactly, "common time" being simply
an older form of "four-four time."
"Three-four" time is indicated by the
fraction %. and means that only three
counts are to be gi?en to each meas
ure. '
When all this has been made perfectr
ly plain to the child he will easily be
able to read the simple little pieces
and exercises on the first few pages of
his exercise bock.
Take the first one and let him study
it, measure by measure, then two or
three measures at a time, being care
ful that ne does not neglect the posi
tion of his fingers, wrists or arms in
the excitement of playing "real mu
sic".
Watch his relaxing, too, lest his mus
cles tiehten; for now' is a critical mo
ment, and the pupil must learn to ap
ply his technique at once, if we are to
keep his touch sweet and clear. .,
Make him relax after each continued
effort, and do not foi'get to apply the
"circle motion'' at frequent Intervals. â¢
When he can play his first title theme
correctly â that is, without one mistake
â without tightening,, his muscles, rais-,
ing his fingers quickly each time, as in
his -scale, and causing; the keys to emit
a sweet, melodious -sound, he " must'
memorize the little piece or exercise, as
the case may be. . :
strike it when we say "one/; and hold
it down until we have said "four."
Show him plenty of whole notes, so
that he may fix them in his mind, and
then show him a half note, explaining
that it is only to be held half as long
as a who!e note, and that therefore
there are two half notes in a measure
where one counts four beatsâ that Is,
two counts to a note. Show him the
distinguishing mark of the half notesâ
the vertical line, called the stem, at the
side of the note â and the*n when he has
become able to pick out the half notes
on a page show him a quarter note.
Tell him that the difference in looks
between a half note and the quarter
note is that the quarter note 'is black,
being filled up inside, while the half
note is hollow. Both have the stem,
as do all notes but the whole note.
Now tell him that there are four
quarter. notes in a measure- where one
counts four beatsâ one to each count.
Make him draw a staff long enough
to hold several measures, then let him
fill these measures with different
groups of half notes, quarter notes and
whole notes, always being sure that he
understands perfectly the properties of
each and allows the proper number of
counts to each measure. If he puts one
half note into a measure he must fllV
the measure out with two quarter notes
or another half note, and so on.
A keen nature observer on the staff
of the Boston Transcript has given out
some interesting aquarium notes.
Is one which shows that behind the dull
fish eye there lies a warm paternal fire:
â¢ "The little stickleback, which is one
of the most pugnacious fishes although
one of the smallest at the Aquarium,
shows a degree of intelligence that is
remarkable. Uke the bass, the male
fish builds the nest, cares for the sggs
while incubating arid afterward guards
the young. One pair of these fishes
reared a family a short while since in
one of the smaller tanks at the Aqua
rium. The male fish built the nest by
collecting small bits of dead weed and
tiny fragments of debris, which he ar
ranged In a circle. When the recep
tacle for the eggs was completed it bore
a remarkable resemblance to the nests
of some birds, and was apparently as
well constructed. The eggs were de
posited in due time, and the father
stickleback settled down to a tireless
vigil until the little sticklebacks should
cast off the yolk-sac and swim forth
Independent into the watery world. The
little fishes grew.rapidly, and it lacked
a day or so before they would be en
tirely free from the cumbersome sacs.
The male in passing over the nest
where the young were swirled the wa
ter with his tall,' with the result that
two of the tiny fishes were swept sev
eral inches from the nest. Seeing what
he had done, the father set about to
repair the damage. He swam to the
nearest offspring and, seizing it care
fully In his mouth, swam with it back
to the nest. Then he returned the other
one In the same way and. as if satis
fied with this achievement, settled
iown beside the nest contented."

Let his practice hour be as much an
understood and immovable thing as his
breakfast hour, his school hour, or his
hour for retiring.
An excellent plan is, I think, to ap
point a little time before breakfast
<even if it i* only fifteen minutes) 'or
practice 'always insisting, however,
that the child shall eat a cracker or
piece of bread, in this ease, before be
ginning work): or In case of an early
breakfast, ha'.f or three-quarters of in
hour after breakfast instead, before
the child departs for school. Then a
practice period at noon, if he comes
home from school at that time, and
Â¦whatever ther* is left to be accom
plished, some time during the late aft
ernoon.
This, for the average child, is a good
division 'of labor. For a uetlcate or
highly nervous child, nowever, an
hour's practice altogether aunng the
day is quite enough.
rest of the ler?on. Plan every moment
of the practice hour â so many minutos |
for srales. so many for reading, so
many for technical exercises, and so on. 1
This will keep the child from practic- j
ing all one thing at the expense of the i
crherp, and will make his work more !
interesting and less monotonous, on ac- j
count of the frequent changes of occu- !
pation. For instance, in the case of a !
thrÂ»>e-quarters of an hour practice pe- |
riod, fl\*e minutes expended on tech- j
r.ical exercises, fifteen on scales and j
twenty-five on reading, for the first pe- j
riod. For the second (lat^r on in the j
day) ten minutes for the technical ex- |
ercisp*. twenty for the ecales and fif
teen for reading. If the child is able to
practice the other half hour (bringing
the who!<? day's work up to two hours),
this last period may be divided equally,
ten minuies for each kind of work.
"Of the many orders for queer things
received by New York exporters from
various quarters of the globe, perhaps
none Is more interesting than an occa
sional request for queen bees," says the
New York Evening Post. "Such orders
come principally from the West Indies,
and Inasmuch as the commission mer
chant is generally called upon to han
dle the honey and wax produced there
by the progeny of these insects, he
finds a safe business Investment in
shipping the bees, even though they
form no source of profit in themselves.
"There are many grades of queen beea
and the breeder must thoroughly un
derstand the highly organized insects
if he expects to produce vigorous,
healthy stock that can be depended on
to gather honey in large quantities.
To this end he selects for mothers none
but honey queens (usually imported) â
queens whose progeny have excelled
all others in the apiary. In placing his
order, the buyer is requested to specify
whether he desires a 'red clover' or a
'honey' queen. The first mentioned
stock is bred for red clover, while the
last named will show up well during
an ordinary honey flow from clover,
basswood and other flowers. The prices
vary according to the grades. An un
tested- queen costs $1, a tested queen $2
and those called select tested $3. Breed
ing queens and select breeding queens
bring J5 and $7 60, respectively, and an
'extra select' one year old is worth $10.
Imported Italian queens, furnished by
the best breeders of that country, are
the ones usually sent to the West In
dies, and they are thoroughly tested
in the Western apiaries before ship
ment. They cost from $3 to $3 each,
but common Italian queens, bred in
this country from pure imported stock,
can be bought at lower figures."

An item of the cost of smallpox la
suggested by the annual report of Dr.
Lee of the Pennsylvania State Board of
Health. The value of human lives,
the cost of death and of illnes3 have
often been estimated, and the results
are convincing arguments that the
public should, for purely politic and
financial reasons, do all in its po-wcr
to 'eradicate disease and prevent un
necessary death. In the last year there
were, according to Dr. Lee. 6504 cases
of smallpox in the State, with 503
deaths. A somewhat careful calcula
tion, bas-d upon these reports, leads
to the conclusion that in the counties
reporting, about 1.500,000 school day3
were lost during the period reported
on. This does not include the great
citlea of the StatQ. which would swell
the figures enormously. In Philadel
phia, for instance, seven elementary^
schools, with an enrollment of more
than 5000 pupils, were closed in a sin-*
gle day because of smallpox In the
families of pupils. In round numbers
we may therefore place the number of
lost school days in the State, from
smallpox, at not less than 2.000,000.-

IT is quite interesting that while his opponents are
daily despairing ,of the republic, because they say
the President is doing nothing to enforce- the anti
trust laws, he is moving steadily upon the works of the
trusts, in the only way possible, which is through the
.courts. The court below dissolved Mr. J. J. Hill's rail
road trust in the merger of the Burlington and Northern
Pacific and Great Northern, and Mr.. Hill has appealed
to the Supreme Court. Attorney General Knox ap
pears in "person for the Government, impeaching the
merger as a monopoly, in restraint of trade, placing the
three competing roads in one control, destroying all mo
tives for competition either in rates or facilities.
The Attorney General in his brief says: '"The final
result was that one and the same set of men, *Hill and
Morgan and *thcir associates, acting through corporate
organization, became invested with absolute power of
control over two parallel and competing systems of rail
way. It borders on absurdity to say that two railway
corporations which under normal conditions are nat
urally competitors for traffic will continue to compete
after both become subject to the same control. A more
effective way of suppressing competition it would be dif
ficult to conceive."
The -President's earnest pursuit of the railroad trust
means more thanUhe mere affirming of the court below
by the Supreme Court. When that is done he will have
established a principle that affects favorably to the peo
ple the entire transportation system of the country. Al
ready the good effect of the decision of the District
Court is felt, and that in. a way that makes it certain
that lawyers know that the President is right, and that
he will get the decision in the Supreme Court. So we
find Mr. Harriman prospecting for a line into the Puget
Sound country, to compete with Hill's roads for that
traffic, and the Western Pacific is buifdfng into this ter
ritory to compete with Harriman and the Santa Fe,
Sane policy in railroading is dictated by the fact that
a country's production and tonnage increase with facili
ties for transportation. In that sense a new road creates
its own business, and latent resources are developed,
which would otherwise remain unproductive.
The President, by destroying Mr. Hill's railroad
trhst, is stimulating the further development of the
country by making competition possible. He is also stim
ulating railway construction, and is touching with' life
those two great sources bf national wealth, production
*and exchange. His friends can afford to be amused at
the â¢tom-tomming of his enemies, serene in the belief
that only, a few of the people can be fooled all of the
time. â¢ ,

harmful to morais, and if we change this prominent,
luring signal of the tenderloin we will revolutionize and
purify its moral tone. The professor needs a new dose
of logic. He is wrong in both premises and conclusion.
He has forgotten the physical axiom that in the tender
loin all policemen are color blind.
WE have noticed the proposed Parliamentary in
quiry into the cause of industrial and physical
decadence in England. A writer, expert in so
ciology, has long observed the effect and finds the cause
in the permanent labor class, in which organization has
developed the idea that men must abide with their class
add not pass on and up. ...
Of every hundred men in London over 65 years of
age nineteen are paupers, and of every hundred women
twenty-two are paupers. It is estimated that the: liquor
bill of the English laborers is $550,000,000 a' year, and
that an English workingman spends four times as much
money for liquor as 'the American. The fires of ambi
tion are quenched in drink, and the children follow m
the class footsteps of their sires. Such conditions must
work out in industrial decay.
The economic ideas of the English labor leaders seem
to be defective. It is economic law that more produc
tion means more wealth and cheaper prices. : Casting
out all other features, the wage of labor is measured by
its productive power; wages rise and prices fall as in
dividual production increases. Some people find it diffir
cult to reconcile higher wages with lower prices. In the
cloth mills of New England seventy years ago five work
men made eight yards of cloth a day, and their wage was
20 cents a day, or $1 for the five, making the labor
cost of the cloth I2# cents a yard. The annual product
of the five workmen was 2400 yards of cloth. Now, by
the use of machinery, and power, and processes, five
workmen in the New England cloth mills produce in a
year 140,000 yards of cloth, but the labor cost has- fallen
to one cent and eight-tenths per yard.
The policy of organization in England seems to be
to limit productive capacity. The labor unions of Great
Britain seem to address'themselves to this abridgment
of production. Thirty years ago an English bricklayer
laid twelve hundred bricks a day; now he is permitted
to lay only four hundred, and on public work only three
hundred and thirty. This system extends to all produc
tive labor, and of course results in raising the labor cost
of buildings, which reacts upon labor in the rent,' and
in the increase of every manufactured product, which the
laborer in turn has to pay to the extent of his necessary
use of such products. In other words, by limiting pro
duction he lowered the purchasing power .of his own
wages. Here, then, is the secret of the success of the
American manufacturer in competing with Great Brit
ain. The American pays wages largely, in excess of the
Englishman, but his excess of production makes its labor
cost less, and raises the purchasing power of American
wages, scr that the American workingman gets not only
actually higher wage?, but relatively higher to the price
of products.
There is much in this for the American workingman
to study when he is incited to support the limitation
of production. He must beware of the faults that have
caused British decadence. Economically, greater pro
duction means greater wealth, less labor cost, lower
prices, and therefore a larger command of his wages
over what the laborer produces, and out of this issue the
better conditions of life .in this country and'the'oppor
tunity of the individual laborer to achieve independence.
The influence of the English idea has already been
felt in this country. There are influential advocates of
the theory that labor is benefited by limiting production.
These advocates are . not satisfied with the reasonable
limitations that arc effected by a shorter day, but insist
upon the right to decrease the product of the shorter
day. Such propositions have the singular demerit of
working grave injury to the workmen in whose interests
they are supposed to be advanced. If worked into prac
tice they mean higher rents, higher clothing, food and
fire, and finally an industrial decay, which by injury to
the country's commerce injures also its labor.
Such propositions appeal to the large foreign immi
gration, which is so rapidly filling our industrial vacan
cies, to the exclusion of native labor, and this makes
it all the more necessary that proper economic views be
inculcated here. This country can stand temporary com
mercial reverses and financial panics. They pass away.
But it cannot stand the slow-moving and permanently
destructive influence' of the theory and practice of lim
ited production as a proper economic theory. The
sooner a counter movement is felt the better it will be
for American labor and American commerce. *

she wore was Illy fitted to withstand
the November winds that, fog laden
and icy in their chilliness, blew in

she sat, moving only when- an extra
cold blast disturbed her thin, worn
little shawl and exposed her shrunken
shoulders. Then with fingers blue
with cold she would search for the
wind tossed ends of the garment,
wrap, the slight covering about her
and resume her lonely vigil.
Even the arrival of the officer of

the unusual sight of a strange figure
long after hours, did not disturb her.

Now explain to him that the single
vertical line, intersecting the staff at
intervals, divides it into "measures."
Tell him that a single large note, with
out any attachment, and hollow, like
an O, is what is called a "whole, note";
because It is to be held through the
whole measure* and no other notes are
played in that measure. For instance,
if we are counting "one, two, three,
four." and three is only one note, a
whole note in the measure, we must
Now let him turn to his music book
once more and try to pick out the dif
ferent notes of the staff, from the music
in some of the earlier pieces or exer
cises. For instance, tell him to find
all the C's on a certain page for you.
Then all the F's. then some C}% and so
on, skipping around among the notes;
and going backward and forward, point
to notes and ask him to tell you what
they are, and, as he gains confidence,
try to confuse him until he becomes so
familiar tfith the notes that he can
name them as rapidly as you call for
them.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Now it is time for him to understand
the real significance of the lines and
thi? spaces between them.
t Tell him that notes are to be written
on both the lines and the spaces, and't
that in going up or down ihe scale,
when we pass above. or below all the
lines little lines are added to continue
the staff, and to make this clear show
him the little line that "middle C"
is on. It is the first line below the
regular staff.
These little lines are called "ledger
lines."
Now, beginning with "middlo C" and
counting upward, the next note above
C would fall on a "space" â the space
between the first "ledger line" and the
lower line of the staff. The next note
will, of course, be D, consequently the
next note, E. will be on the lowest line
of the staff, F will be. on the first space.
G on the' second line, A on thp second
space, and so on. When the third space
is reached (in music one alwnys counts
up from the bottom) the pupil will find
that he has risen eight notes, or rather,
seven, in the scale, and is at C, the
octave above "middle C."
It is necessary that he should become
perfectly familiar with the notes on the
lines and spaces before going on with
his reading; therefore let him commit
them to memory at once. The "spaces"
will not trouble him if you explain to
him that they spell a word when taken
all togetherâ F, A. C, Eâ face! This
will help him to remember tho spaces.
The lines are E, G, B, D, F, and are a
little harder to memorize, but if he re

again and again, and then writes out
the whole staff with the appropriate
letters on the lines and spaces (like the
illustration) he will soon implunt them

"When, the Press Club of San Fran
cisco consented to accept the net pecu
niary proceeds of the performance last
evening at Fischer's Theater it did not
propose to furnish the stage attrac
tions, or any considerable portion of
them, but at the fifty-ninth minute fate
stepped in and decreed, that by long
odds the biggest feature of the show
should be a wearer -of the club button.
It was exactly 3:30 o'clock yesterday
afternoon when President Tyler and
Vice President Leffingwell, with tears
of anxiety in their united voice, asked
W. C. Hc-llhvay, the young newspaper
man, who is better known as "Cap."
if he would not fill the aching void in
the cast of "I. O. IX." created by the
serious illness of Max M. Dill. "Cap"
hesitated but a moment.
"I don't know the lines of the part,"
he said, "and I have no time to 'get
up* In them. But I'll do anything to
help out the club."
Tyler and Lefflngwell embraced, him
and Herr Fischer smiled gratitude.
"We'll all get in and push you
through," said Winfleld Blake, "and I'll
guarantee that you'll make the hit of
the performance." -
"Cap" at once plunged into the study
of the part of Iney Stuntz, and at 8:30
o'clock he made his first entrance in
the play with Kolb and Curtis. There
after while he was on the stage the
house â and it was one of the most bril
liant houses of the seasonâ was his.
Blake's prediction was more than veri
fied. Never did any comedian on any
stage provoke more vociferous laughter
than rewarded "Cap's" efforts to
amuse. Every time he said anything,
and numerous times when he was due
to say something and said nothing, the
audience fairly shrieked.
It was not Comedian Holliways fault
that the lighting arrangements of the
FUiRe made it impossible for him . to
follow the lines of the prompt book he
held, nor would it be fair to accuse
him of negligence because his atten
tion to the book precluded possibility
of his taking up the cues which his
stagemates so generously repeated for
his enlightenment. And if he was us
ually a couple of pages ahead of the
current dialogue the other actors might
have talked mere rapidly^ and caught
up with him.
At the close of the second act Kolb
and Curtis, and Blake and Amber, and
O'Ramey and Dillon, and the Althea
twins, and the other principals were
so green with envy of Holliway's hit
that he magnanimously, offered to re
tire from the cast and turn his part
over to a regular understudy who was
familiar with its lines and business but
did not look the character. Stage Man
ager Jc-nes promptly spurned the pro
posal. In all other respects the enter
tainment was a triumph.
Many interpolations relating to Press
Club persons and affairs brought de
sired appreciation, and the Press Club
Quartet sang popular selections while
the curtain was down. But "Cap" Hol
liway's deput as a Thespian will dwell
green in the memory of those who* wit
nessed it when all the other features
are forgotten.

sult in Owens' dismissal. Howard was
held in $5000 bonds for trial in the Su

The verdict of the jury is regarded
by the Board of Public Works as a
harsh one, owing to the fact that Mrs.
Heath, who secured the judgment, ad
mitted that she was aware lhat the
sidewalk was in bad condition when
she walked on it and sustained a frac
ture of the arm. Evidence also showed
that there were three street lights
brightly burning at the time and yet
the Board of Public Works is held re
sponsible for the accident and all sim
ilar ones that may occur in the future.

On the night of December 20 of last
year Mrs. Dora Heath stumbled over a
loose plank in front of the Vesidence
at 1511 Buchanan street. In falling
she broke her arm and chipped a
piece of bone from the end of the hu
merus. As a result of the Injury the
woman's arm will be stiff and almost
useless fbr the rest of her life. Upon
recovery she immediately filed suit for
$20,000 damages, basing her claim on
the fact that It was the duty of the
Board of Public Works to keep the
sidewalks in repair.
The board secured a stay of pro
ceedings for thirty days, during which
time an appeal will be taken on the
ground that the verdict is excessive.
the board is confronted with
the fact that the' Supervisors failed to
set aside any money for the keeping
In repair of sidewalks and therefore
it is powerless in the premises. An
other difficulty intervenes in that con
tractors are unwilling to enter into
contracts for the repair of sidewalks
and the charter requires that all public
work shall be done by contract.
The alternative which the Board of
Public Works now expresses it? inten
tion to avail itself of is the section of
the ordinance which makes it a mis
demeanor for any property owner to
neglect to put his sidevralk in good
condition, after being officially notified
to do so by the Board of Public Works.
The penalty for 3uch neglect is a fine
of $500 or imprisonment for six months,
or both. The Board of Public Works
in the past has been loth to carry out
the provisions of the ordinance regardr
ing the arrest of delinquent property
owners, but it feels that urtder the de
cision it would be liable for many thou
sands of dollars of damages ns the out
come of accidents from defective side
walks. In many cases ladles are the
offenders in this regard and the board
has hitherto refrained from taking un
pleasant action.
A simple compliance with the notice
of the board that bad sidewalks are
to be repaired will save much incon
venience and a' possible visit to the
Police Court, the Board of Public
Works think.
VERDICT DEEMED HARSH.
XO MONEY Â£OR REPAIRS.
The ordinance is very explicit in the
matter and simply states that after due
notice has been given by the Board of
Public Works to any property owner
whose sidewalk is in need of repair he
shall forthwith proceed to repair the
same. In the event thart the property
owner refuses or fails to obey the notice
the Board of Public Works may pro
ceed to do the work, but at the ex
pense of the city.
Smarting under the verdict of a jury
in Judge Kerrigan's court awarding
$5000 damages to Mrs. Dora Heath for
injuries sustained by a defective side
walk in front of 1511 Buchanan street,
the Board of Public Works decided
yesterday to take drastic measures
against property owners who neglect to
keep the sidewalks in rront of their
premises in proper repair. The arrest
of such property owners, after due
notification has been served upon them
to repair the sidewalks, is ordered.
By the verdict the commissioners of
works are made personally responsible
for any accidents resulting from dan
gerous sidewalks and in order to fore
stall the saddling of further damages
upon them they have come to the con
clusion to make property owners abide
strictly by the terms of the ordinance
governing the maintenance of side

Harry Howard, alias W. J. Watson,
exhibited an unexpected amount of
chivalry yesterday when he appeared
before Justice Mogan for a preliminary
hearing on the charge of highway rob
bery. Howard ,.is accused of having
held up the saloon of William Little at
760 Howard street and forced the pro
prietor to give him 520. Then he start
ed to run and was pursued by Police
man Skelly, who fired at the fleeing
man. The first bullet from the offi
cer's revolver struck George King, a
fifteen-year-old boy, seriously wound
ing him. Howard then fired at the po-
There is still a frontier in this coun
try, notwithstanding Owen \Vister and
other praisers of times past, who be
wai! the passing of the picturesque life
of the outer edges of civilization. MoTe
over, the frontier is right at the back
dopr of San Francisco, if the story of
Vincent Wallace, told under oath to
Judge Mogran yesterday, may be be
lieved. Wallace was arrested at an
early hour yesterday morning loitering
on Battery street, just *off Market. In
his pocket was found an elongated re
volver and to 50 in money. The arrest
ing officers watched him for nearly an
hour in his vigil before they ap
proached him. When they found him,
accoutered as he ivas. they concluded
they had a real, original hold-up man.
But Wallace had a different tale to
tell. He raid he came from Menlo
Park to this city in search of employ
ment. In order to economize his slen
der hoard of money, he concluded to
seek some dark, quiet neighborhood
and sleep in the angle of a building.
Accordingly he picked out Battery
street near Market as a resting place,
but did not retire at once because he
could find no cozy corner. When ques
tioned as to his reason for carrying
such a formidable weapon as that
found on his person, he appeared sur
prised to learn that the act was an
irregular proceeding. Everybody, he
said, In Menlo Park carried a revolver.
The practice was as common as carry
ing toothpicks or matches in one's
pocket. He said he had an uncle in
Menlo Park and other witnesses there
who would testify to his good charac
ter, so the case went over until FrlÂ»
day to allow them to be summoned.
Then it will be determined whether
or not Wallace is merely a foolish
country boy or that most dangerous
of all criminals, a footpad. If it shall
turn out to be the latter he will not
have to look for employment until
many moons have waxed and waned.

A new machine gun invented by a
young soldier named Eugene Dumor
tier of the One Hundred and Forty-fifth
Infantry Regiment is receiving the
close attention of the committee on
new inventions a*t the French "War Of
fice. Dumortier claims that the gun
will; completely sweep a given zone,
leaving no intervening space in which
It would be comparatively safe for any
body of troops to move. While one bat
tery of the gun is flrtng at a range of
2000 yards another will simultaneously
fire at 300 yards. Increasing or dimin
ishing its range as may be necessary.
The gun rests on a, four-wheeled car
riage and works on an adjustable
swivel- steel platform, so that it can be
turned^ in any direction. Each of the
two batteries has ten barrels, and the
magazine 'Is: loaded automatically, it
is said that 450' Lebel balls can be fired

The farmers. of the United States are
apparently- -making- no effort to reap
any part of" this golden harvest for
themselves. The census of 130C showed
t5ie total 'number of goats'iri the United
States to be less than two millions, and
when it is understood that the skins
of probably twenty million gcats were
required to make; the $15,000.000 < worth
imported last year Jt can. be -seen that
the supply from the United'States could
have formed but a small share, of the
total consumption. Yet the fact that
a large share of our supply Of this im
portant import comes, frnm India,
China, France and Mexico suggests
that there are large areas in" the United
States which might procace gnats suc
cessfully and in sufficiently large num
bers to supply the entire honv? demand.
âHarper's Weekly.
A new industry is offering itsalf to
the farmers and manufacturers of the
United States. The fact thai $1:5,000,003
worth of goatskins are now annually
imported into the United States and
that our enterprising manufacturers
are now obliged to send half-way
around the world for a large s^hare of
them suggest that the farmers of this
country have a great opportun:ty to put
a large share of this sum into their own
pockets ar.d that the entire turn may
be divided between our producers and
manufacturers. Importations of goat
skins into the United . Spates .now
amount to about $25,000,000 per annum,
ar.d a large share of these are brought
from India. China, Arabia ar.d South
eastern Russia. The increasing popu
larity of certain classes of kid leather
for footwear, as well as gloves, has
greatly increased the demand for.goat
skins in the United States within recent
years. In 1SS5 the value of goatskins
imported was aoout $4,000,000; bj* 1S90
it had prov.n to $9,000,000; by 189S it

The members of Golden Gate Park
Driving Association met last night in
the Palace Hotel and discussed the
raisins' of funds for the proposed new
speedway in the park. The Commis-
Fioners have outlined an ambitious af
fair, which will cost nearly $60,000.
This will include a sneed track of
three-quarters of a mile, a polo field,
football gridiron and cinder path. The
field will bo in an amphitheater,
around the Fides of which there will
be promenades and benches for spec
tators. It will be easily accessible
by street cars and is expected to prove
a marked attraction when completed.
It will start 'at the foot of Straw
berry hill and will include a part of
the present speedway. The polo en
thusiasts have volunteered to sub
scribe handsomely and it is expected
the necessary funds will be readily
forthcoming. The Commissioners do
not expect the entire amount to be
made up by subscription.
Only four players appeared on tne
Euriingame Country Club polo field
yesterday and instead of a match tnÂ«
gentlemen ] resent. Messrs. Driscoll,
Dunphy. McCreerj' and Carolan. took
the opportunity to put their green co
nies through pome --severe practice.
Beginning on Christmas day. it is the
intention of the club to give a polo car

Y.car's ciay. The principal events will
be on the bolld&ys and on the Sunday

which English and Hawaiian teams
will participate, as well as two from
the r-outh. Altogether the plans for

most elaborate character.
DISCUSS NEW PARK SPEEDWAY
The fifth round found Tommy forc
ing matters again, but the end was in
sight, as Woods put in a left to the
head' that made Reilly reel, while an
other to the body put Tom to the mat
for eight seconds. Tommy went to the
floor again and it looked all off- for
the white man, when he suddenly rallied
and gave Woods a stiff left swing that
caught the colored man on lie head.
A %ecc-nd later, though, another stom
ach puncft sent Tommy down for nine
seconds. Woods waited and a third one
all but settled It. the bell saving Tom.
Reilly was weak when the sixth and
last began. He tried to force matters,
but his blows lacked force. Woods
went in and floored the white man four
times, and up went the sponge.
Spike Foley get the decision in four
rounds over Paul Crum. Jack Madden
was given the decision over Jack Duffy
in the second round, after the referee
refused to allow. Duffy's claim of foul.
Woods fought Tommy into the Reilly
cc-rner in the , opening of . the fourth
round, but Tommy got out and gave
the colored man a bunch of stingers
to the face that drew blood freely.
Billy sent Reilly to the floor with a
left to. the jaw and Tommy took nine
seconds. The white man was floored
again, but pulled himself together and
Woods was missing body punches at
the end of the round.
REILLY'S BLOWS LACK FORCE.
Reilly opened up round one with live
ly leading and a cheer from the shoit
enders went up when Woods went to
the floor before the gong had barsly
ceased Its din. Then Reilly went to the
floor, but they were together in a few
seconds, driving their heavy rights and
lefts to head and body, hammering
without a second's let up. â¢ One stiff
left to the* body sent KeilTy to' the
ropes. Up he came at the colored rrian
and floored Woods in a. mixup of
punching. Tommy was a bit tired
when % the bell rang for corners.
j Barely was the second round on be
fore Woods sent Reilly to the ropes
with a stomach smash. They got to
gether and it was fast work. Xear the
end of the round Woods put in his
right to the stomach and Reilly was
all but gone when the gong sounded.
Tommy forced matters upon the
opening of the third round. There was
a hot exchange and Woods tried but
missed several stiff fines at Rellly's
head. In a rally Woods landed his left
on Reilly's stomach and the white man
went down. A second time he .was
joited to the floor, but was up again
in six seconds and fighting hard. In
the battling Reilly was damaged badly
and wer.t to his corner tired.
WOODS IS KNOCKED DOWN.
Billy Woods, the Los Angeles colored
middle-weight, finished Tommy Reilly
in the sixth round last night at the
Sequoia Club, Oakland. While Tommy
was being counted out by George Har
ding, the timekeeper, Reilly's seconds
threw up the sponge and Referee iSd
dle Graney gave the fight to the dark
skinned pugilist.
At no time did Reilly have a chancs.
That he was not knocked out in the
second and again in the fifth round
was due to the timely sounding of the
bell. Despite the manifest superiority
of Woods, the pair put up five and a
half rounds of as furious fighting as
any patron of the sport could hope to
witness in years. Wfjods did the trick
with his terrific stomach and body
smashes; They would have downed
better men than Reilly and the wonder
was how he lasted a second after tak
ing some of Woods' punches.
Billy Jordan's warning that beta
would be called off if there should be
any sign of "fake" was unnecessary so
far as the result showed. The veteran
announcer said there had been rumors
about that the fight did not look right.
There was not anything left of the
gossip after the contest ended. Old
timers set the bout as a mark for swift
work. Tommy did not show up phys
ically as strong appearing as Woods.
While the colored man was In fine fet
tle, Reilly seemed a bit fat and his skin
did not have a healthy glow. The
white fighter was extremely nervous
from the first. He forced the game
from the start of nearly every round.
His opponent took things more coolly
and waited for his chance to send in
those stomach Jolts that finished Tom
my. Woods covered better and Reilly's
drives at the head, were too oftsn
smothered to be effective.
The trouble is all over terms. Man
ager Ezra Decoto sent a representative
to Denver to meet Barnard, manager
for Minnesota, to arrange terai3 if pos
sible. The California â¢ representative
notified Decoto yesterday that an
agreement had been made and it
seemed nothing further stood in the
way of a game. Briefly, the terms were
that California would pay the traveling
expenses of twenty Mrnnesotana to the
coast and maintain them in San Fran
cisco for ten day,s, California to assuru*
all the financial burden.
Manager Decoto received a telegram,
to-day from Dr. H. L. Williams, chair
man of the Minnesota athletic commit
tee. Insisting that all the terms agreed
to by Manager Barnard be strictly
lived up to and enumerating some of
the articles he supposed were contained
in the contract. These articles called
for bringing the visitors out over the
Burlington route as far as Omaha,
thence over the Denver and Rio Grande
road to Oregon, with stopover privi
leges, and return by way of Los An
geles; incidental expenses amounting
to $250, telegraph expenses $30 and ex
penses for representative to Denver $40.
Manager Decoto at once placed him
self in communication with California's
representative, who had by this time
reached Na^r Mexico. He discovered
(he agreement called for none of the
luxuries mentioned by Dr. Williams.
He then wired Dr. Williams, demand
ing that he either accept the agree
ment as it stands or quit altogether.
Manager Decoto is awaiting a reply to
his last dispatch and upon it depends
whether there will be a game on New
Year's day or not.
The hesitating conduct of the Minne
sota representatives is thought to be
due to the failure of their Denver agent
to get more liberal terma, though he.
was clothed with full power to act
when he set out to meet the California'
representative.
BERKELEY, Dec. 15.â Complications
that arose to-day between the business
representatives on both sides threaten
to be the cause of the abandonment of
the proposed game between the foot
ball elevens of the University of Cali
fornia and of the University of Michi
gan on Xew Year's day.

Burns waited patiently for an open
ing cm the rail, but it did not come,
and at the head of the stretch he
found himself pocketed. Taking his
mount back, he intended to go around
the leaders, but just then Booker, on
Muresca, lay over from the rail, when
quick as a gopher dives into his hole
Burns was there with Rogue.
Then ensued a terrific drive to the
wire. Royal Rogue getting the decision
by a nose from Beau Ormonde. Mu
resca dropped back beaten and Arabo
took the show. When Burns came out
from the paddock the crowd gave him
a hearty welcome and after his superb
finish it swelled to the proportions of
an ovation.
No better card could be desired for
an ordinary day than the one fur
nished, and ,as four favorites won the
talent got the money. The weather
was cloudy and threatening. The
track was good, but not fast.
Four to five against Constellator in
the betting on the opening sprint looked
a liberal price. . Hildebrand had the
mount and the Brutus galdir.g won all
the way. Evander, after b^ing the
runner up for quite a way, fell, back
and Dora I downed Bee Rosewater for
the place.
LORD WADSWORTII IS CLEVER.
Garnet Ferguson's colt Lord Wads
worth took" the maiden two-year-old
purse. The youngster closed favorite
over Ebony and outbreaking his fie.d
at the start was never in difficulty.
Ebony came from behind urnl'-r HlluV
brand's urging, beating out Andrew B.
Cook for place honors.
Dupont, the Green Morris entry In
the mile and a furlong selling run,
proved a bitter disappointment. Bet
tors accepted 4 to 5 about him and the
best Jack Martin could do was to drop
the big fellow in third. Cougar, a 12
to 1 shot. r!Cdtn by Charley Kelly,
made all the running and scored clev
erly at the wire from Veterano.
The crp.ck Eastern mudlark, Ahunia
da. made his California debut in Uie
seven-furlong purse run. Dr. Kyle's
horse ran an excellent race under J.
Jones' niloting, but was held safe
throughout by the . favorite. Epicure,
losing in a mud drive by a neck. Lead
er, a- wellTplayed one from the Jennings
stable, finished third.
Because ot the presence in the saddle
of Tommy Burns, Forest King went to
the post favorite for the. concluding
mile felling affair. Tommy's mount
was prominent from the jump, but il
was r.ot in the cards, and he ran into
the show. Caronal. with Hildebrand in
the saddle, came from behind in the
stretch, running home an easy winner
over Illowaho.
NOTlA OF. THE TRACK.
Hildebrand piloted .. two winners.
-Cheeny. one of the starters in the
maiden "two-year-old event, fell at the
three and a half furlong pole with Iva
Powell. The latter was taken to the
track hospital and . attended by Dr.
Dunn, who. found the clever light
weight had suffered a fracture of a
email bone in one; of 'his ankles.
The $1000 handicap at one and a six
teenth miles is the feature yvent of
to-day's card. Among the starters are
the good Eastern performers Oarsman
and Faulconbridge*. Fossil, , another
starter, and winner of the Crocker sell
ing stake, meets'" his old rival, Ho
ratiue. on equal terms.
In the last event Jane Holly, holder
of the world's record of 1:18 3-5 for six
and a half furlongs, the entry of
"Plunger" Joe Ycager, makes her Cali

BURNS IS POCKETED.
As a curtain raiser, marking his first
appearance this season, Tommy Burns
rode a finish on James Nealon's horse
Royal Rogue in the six and a half fur
long handicap at Ingleside yesterday
that caused numerous spectators to
be seized with attacks of heart failure,
vertigo, spinal meningitis, lambitis and
sundry other diseases.
.. Originally Otto Wonderly was card
ed to ride the Nealon entry, but that

The prima donna was once more
given a chance , to 'take the center of
the stage. She made her entrance and
started to tell the audience that she
had r.ot asked her husband to write

As a result a compromise has now
been effected whereby, it is said, the
Orphans' Home will turn over to the
other beneficiaries the sum of $250,000,
and in addition agrees to have deducted
from Its share of the estate the indi

ened litigation is abandoned.
<At the time the executors discovered
that Norton's will was subject to the
laws of California the heirs were pre
paring to contest his will on the ground
that the captain was not of sane mind
when he executed the document and
were preparing to dig up from the past
the many peculiar traits of the de
ceased, which had made him a famous
character in Louisville. This suit, how
ever, will now be dropped, and Execu
tors Norton and Barr are on their way
home, where they expect to quickly re
lieve themselves of the responsibilities
imposed on them by the will of Cap
tain Norton.
The estate of the deceased was val-
I ued at over $800,000, and of this, as
| stated before, the bulk was willed t<>
; the Orphans' Home, the heirs of the
; captain receiving sums ranging from
$1000 to $15,000. When the executors
entered upon their duties with a view
of settling up the estate and made a
trip to California to look over the
property located in this State they
were suddenly confronted with a pro
vision of the California law that pro
hibits a testator leaving more than one
third of his estate to a charitable or
ganization. The discovery caused no
e.pd of excitement among the benefi
ciaries of the will and the legal repre
sentatives of the Orphans* Home In
Louisville at once took steps to carry
the case into the courts in order to pro
tect the interests of the institution In
the estate of the captain.
The prospects of a long siege of liti
gation caused Executors Norton and
Barr to make another trip to this State,
where they engaged local legal talent
to clearly interpret the law of the
State. It was found that Norton had
renounced his citizenship in the State
of Kentucky and become a citizen of
California. His will having been exe
cuted in this State, there was no reason
to Question further the right to apply
the law of California in the matters of
the estate, and the executors so set
forth in a comrrvunicatlon sent to the
interested parties in Louisville.
COMPROMISE EFFECTED.
LEAKX MOHE OF LAW.
G. W. Xorton and James W. Barr,
the former a banker and the latter a
prominent attorney of Lo'nisville, are
registered at the Palace. The gentle
men are the executors of the estate
of the late Captain W. F. Norton, an
eccentric character of Louisville, who
left a large fortune, the bulk of which
was bequeathed to the Baptist Or
phans' Home of Kentucky, and it is
this particular bequest that has led
to much trouble in the settlement of
the estate and eventually upset the
original provisions of the captain's will.
Captain Norton, shortly before his
death, came to California and located
at Coronado, where he built himself
a beautiful home, in which he finally
died. His will provided that his body
should be cremated in Cincinnati and
money was set aside for a special train
to carry his relatives and friends to
the latter city, the desire having been
expressed by the captain that his fu
neral should be an occasion of merri
ment.
The gallery was ready to applaud if
he said that Wilkerson was an "un
fair house," but again Kolb retained
his presence of mind and coyly an
swered "that Wilkerson was no gen
tleman and his reputation was the
worst ever."
Kolb was subjected to a close cate
chistai at the hands of Attomew New
bergh. who played the part usually as
signed to Barney Bernard.
"Have you ever read a 'unanimous'
letter written about him?"
"Haw, haw! Vot do you mean?" re
plied Kolb, in his best dialect. "Are
you playing theater or chust ' mean
anon-non-non-mbus letter, don't you?"
â¢The stage manager prompted Attor
neyNewbergh, and the play continued.
Newbergh sprang some more dialect
and the audience enjoyed it. Kolb was
allowed to depart, and he sat in the
wings and watched^the rehearsal with
deep interest. Â¦ Â¦'.
Al Williams, alias Lyle Murphy, had
his lines down fine and needed no
prompting. He spoke dramatically.
He did not blink 'neath the calcium's
glare, and he glanced toward the back
benches in the hope that he would get
a "hand" from the gallery. 'Wilkerson
was absent from court", otherwise he
would have "frosted" the rehearsal.
Williams told of overhearing a conver
sation between Mrs. Ovita Leath-
Hawes and Ira Puerl Wilkerson, ithe
It was a tired bunch of soubrettes
and supers that attended the dress re
hearsal yesterday morning. In the
glare of the gaslight some of them
looked passe. The glitter of diamonds
loaned by the glass works, the/ sheen
of silks and fresh young faces that
usually peer over the footlights were
missing. Shapely limbs that usually
pirouette to sprightly tunes were hid
den by trailing skirts and picture hats
covered the fluffy hair of the fair mem
bers of the profession.
Judge Murasky played the part of
the leader of the' orchestra and he soon
had the instruments playing in har
mony. -
Attorney Humphrey opened the re
hearsal by calling William Kolb to the
stand. The tall and willowy, form of
the <Jerman. comedian pushed its way
toward the center of the stage. Seat
ing himself, he was ready to do a mon
ologue or piny to the gallery. He did
neither.
"Do you know Ira Puerl Wilkerson?"
asked Attorney Humphrey, who was
cast for the part of the inquiring rela
tive.
... V Sure, Mike.'i-. Kolb started to say,
but rememberingf he was not talking
to Partner Dill, replied, "Yes. I know
him."
"How's his reputation?"
Kolb's View of Wilkerson.
SOUBKETTES WERE TIRED.
As the curtain was rung down in
Judge Murasky's court yesterday the
actors in the divorce suit of Amber
Wilkerson against Ira Puerl, Wilkerson
took their departure from the impro
vised theater and hied themselves to
other scenes. Quite a large crowd filled
the courtroom and waited patiently for
Maud Amber to sing "Bedalia." but
were disappointed. However, they saw
"Clarence" Kolb in the original. Clar
ence took the morning off to attend
court and say that Ira Puerl was an
awfully bad man, and he did not talk
in dialect in his effort to convince
Judge Murasky.
There was no matinee performance
yesterday. The rehearsal in the morn
ing brought out the strength of Fisch
er's Theater. Chorus girls vied with
the prima donna for the center of the
stage and the glare of the calcium.
Although the playlet entitled "The Lost
Pajamas" was not finished the pre
vious afternoon, the audience made use
of "rain checks" and came back to see
the finish of the local problem play.
Judge Murasky' at. one time in his
career strode the boards and looked
yearningly up to Juliet's window and
sighed 'or the moon. As stage man
ager of the original drama he knew
when to give the leading lady her cue
and prompt the absent minded actors
in the performance.
For nearly an hour the firemen bat
tled with the flames. A hose was run
through the main entrance and the
firemen fought the Â¦ flames from the
inside. Another stream played on
the roof and. into the burning apart
ments.
Mr. Babin was the heaviest loser
by the fire. He and his family occu
pied five rooms adjoining Mrs. Mar
tin's apartment and their contents
were totally, destroyed. lie had no In
surance on the personal property. His
loss is estimated at Â§10,000.
Mrs. Martin was also a heavy loser.
All her wedding presents were de
stroyed and her property was only
partly insured. The hotel property is
owned by H. Brandenstein and is fully
insured. Mr. and Mrs. Zan Beystain
conduct the hotel and whatever loss
they sustained is also covered by in
surance.
A swaying portiere in the rooms of
Mrs. Marie Martin became Ignited
by contact with a gas jet and caused
.a costly blaze in the Hotel Wellesley,
an apartment house, corner of Cal
ifornia and Larkin streets, yesterday
morning. Before the flames could be
extinguished by the Fire Department
the upper floor of the structure was
badly damaged. Guests lost heavily
by the blaze and there was great ex
citerflent in the house during the
progress of the fire.
Mrs. Martin had joined the other
guests at breakfast and all were en
joying their meal in the dining-room
on the first floor when the alarm of
fire was heard through the house.
Immediately there was great excite
ment. Many guests rushed to their
rooms to get their valuables and
others rushed into the street. The
halls were filled with smoke and the
flames could be seen licking their way
along the woodwork. Fortunately the
fire occurred when all the guests were
up- ,
. Adir.irrrs <if art thronged the upper
chamber of the Bohemian Club yester
day afternoon and inspected the paint
injrs constituting the seventh annuaJ
exhibition by the artist members of
that organization. It was en exclusive
invitation affair and from 2 til! 5 o'clock
the haJl was comfortably filled with
handsomely gowned women and their
escorts, while a steady countermarch
v.as kept up on the stairway. At least
one thousand persons went, saw ani
criticised. While there was variance
cf taste, of course, the criticism was
favorable as a whole. Comparison with
previous expositions was freely drawn,
and in no Instance was It in disparage
ment of the current show. Disciples
cf all "schools" were there, and while
each contingent gushed over the work
of its especial practitioners the output
of rivals was not belittledâ that is,
audibly. Even the deadly Â«niff of in
difference was absent.
Tet all types of the dilettanti wore
represented. The voice of the out
spoken iTiember, who assumes to say
â¢what he thinks, and defies, if he does
not challenge, contradiction, was heard
In the hall, but if he threw down any
r&untlets they were not picked up.
And the cautious member â mostly fem
inineâwas traditionally careful to ab
stain from venturing any comment that
might provoke discussion. Indeed a
more conservative congregation of con
noiFPeurs never inspected a collection
cf canvases in San Francisco.
There were numerous expressions of
regret that more of the exhibits were
not marked "Sold," and one richly at
tired matron, after she had exhaustive
ly viewed a picture bearing that much
desired Inscription, opsniy expressed
Borrow that she had not oeen afforded
opportunity to bid for it. Then she
Â¦wondered how many dollars had been
exchanged for it, who the purchaser
was and whether he would sell it again
at a reasonable profit. All of vhich
sounded as sweet music to thi tars of
the artist? who overheard and who saw
to it that the lady did not pursue the
remainder of her tour of inspection un
attended.
The statuary, too, came in for much
attention. The competing designs for
the proposed Bret Harte monument
were closely scanned, ana tho favori* -
ism for "Luck of Roaring Camp" as
a them*? was noted by all present.
The exposition will continue till De

Pure Cocoa of Undoubted Quality

THAT IS
f. Goodfellow, of the'London

f givingsome hints concern-
ing the proper preparation
of cocoa, says:
'"Start with a pui*'e cocoa of uiuloubtcd
quality and excellence of manufacture,
and which bears the name of a respectable
firm. This point is important, for there
are many cocoas on the market which
have been doctored by the addition of al-
kali, starch/ malt, kola, hops, etc."
Look for thh trade- Examine the package you receive and
mark on erery package sure u TS OUT trademark.
Under the 'decision of the U. S. Courts no other Cocoa
is entitled to be labeled or sold as "Baker's Cocoa."

The army transport Sherman, Cap
tain Bruguiere in command, arrived
early yÂ« -sterday morning from the
Philippine* with 1030 passengers, made
up principally of the officers and men
of the Thirtieth United States Infantry.
Colonel O'Conneil is a stickler for dis
cipline and the snJdlers that returned
on the Sherman were treated to daily
and liberal doses of drill. They were
kept busy from the time they boarded
the trooper until they landed at the
Presidio. "Xo wonder the ship looks
clean," raid one of the soldiers. "We
haven't had time even to strike a
match on the paint since we've been
abnerd."
Tho ship does look clean and the
credit for it was given to Captain Bru
guiere and Chief Officer Kidston. Tho
Shermnn will leave for the Philippines
January 1, it having been found i/n
possible to complete the repairs on the
Thomas in time. The Shbrman is in
pood condition and Major Devol Â¦Â¦â¢x
pects to have no difficulty in having
her' ready for sea by New Year's day.*
The Sherman brought 590 enlisted
men of the Thirtieth Infantry, 122
members of the Engineer Corps, S2 cas
uals, 53 sick, 3 ir.Ear.e, 23 general pris
oners, 23 discharged soldiers and 59
civilian employes.
When the Sherman reached port
Lieutenant George R. Sharon of the
Thirtieth was confined to his quarters
as a penalty for violating the 11 o'clock
light ordinance a few nights ago.
Sharon, it is said, was the innocent
victim of circumstances. A number of
passrncers. military and civilian,, on
the night in question celebrated the ap
proach to land in a manner so hilarious
that pome non-celebrant complained to
the officer of the day. It was past the
time when lights were supposed to be
out, and that officer reported the dis
turbance to Colonel O'Connell, who im
mediately proceeded to the seat of war.
News of the gathering gale reached
the noisy party and before the storm
broke the culDrits had found cover.
One of them, a civilian, entered the
rjoom in which Lieutenant Sharon was
sleeping. He aroused Sharon and had
just pulled him out ot bed to tell him
all about it when Colonel O'Connell
passed the room.
Colonel O'Connell said last night that
Fhaion would bo restored to duty to
day.
"You're under arrest," said the col
onel to Sharon. Explanations were
neither asked nor offered, but it is said
that Sharcn will have no difficulty in
satisfying his -superiors of his inno
cence.
Among the passengers on the Sher
man was Arthur S. Kelly, better known
as "Yellowstone" Kelly, who served
from 1ST5 to 1877 as scout under Gen
eral Miles!. He was commissioned cap
tain of volunteers during the Spanish-
American war and now holds ati office
under the insular government. --;1-^j
Thanksgiving was celebrated . on
board. Chief Steward Evans served his
passengers an excellent dinner and then
proved his versatility by managing a
musical entertainment, the programme
for which came from T*is clever pen
and to which he contributed music and
comedy in professional style.
The Sherman's passengers were as
follows:

In the center of the great agricul
ture building at St. Louis in the expo
sition of 1904 will stand the exhibit of
the wine men of California as a spe
cial feature. It will be, in fact, the
wine exhibit for the United States, it
having been determined that California
shall. alone make the feature showing
for the entire country in competition
with fifty other parts of the world
where wine is produced. Yesterday af
ternoon leading wine men of this State
met in the rooms of the Chamber of
Commerce in this city and conferred
with Commissioner J. A. Filcher and
Architect Maybeck relative to making
as attractive a showing as possible.
Mr. Maybeck had drawings which
had been previously seen by the Cali
fornia Commissioners to St. Louis. In
a general way the gorgeous installa
tion plan embodied in the drawings was
approved^by the wine men. The space
that the special wine show will oc
cupy will be 46 by 52 feet. This it is
proposed to completly fill as attractive
ly as possible. The general ground floor
plan may be roughly described as hav
ing four curved sides with an orna
mental projection at each corner, in
the center of the whole being a circular
space.
An elaborate design has been ap
proved to cover these outlines. The in
closure will be surrounded with a struc
ture highly ornamental, in which will
be inclosed a great array of California
wines in bottles and casks. The chief
attractions in the installation will be
found at the four corners, at each of
which will be a huge wine cask, dec
orated with a motto in several lan
guages, the cask resting on a broad
and high pedestal. High above this a
handsome superstructure will rise at
each corner. The supporting columns
will be crowned with figures of bears
and the faces of the columns will be
adorned with sculptured heads of large
size and playfully referring to the vine
and its fruitage.
Huge tinted banners will deck the
four corners. These will be entirely
fringed with bottles of wine and strings
of wir.e bottles will extend from the
banner tops to the superstructure. On
each banner will be a representation
in colored silk of a huge grizzly bear,
holding a goblet which the animal is
about to drain. The entrance to the
wine structure, it was determined at
the meeting yesterday, ought to be from
the floor level and it was also decided
that it would be better not to have any
steps to climb to reach it.
In the interior circular space will rise
a column or statue. Around the circle
will be seats for the visitors. An orna
mental entrance is also a part of the
plan of installation and California bears
are a part of the decorative scheme.
The wine men discussed the situation
somewhat, heard reports concerning
progress and adjourned to be called
together again later. Â»
William Miles, 17 years of age, and
William Hogan. 15, are in the City
: Prison charged with an attempt to
commit ro,bbery. They were arrest
ed on Monday night by Sergeant El-
and Policeman McGowan and were
booked at the City Prison yesterday
morning.
F. S, Fadelli and John Long, sail
| ors, who live in the Sailors' Home,
: were walking from the Seamen's In
stitute on Steuart street to the home
shortly after 10 o'clock Monday night.
When they reached Steuart and Mis
sion streets Miles, it is alleged, shoved
a revolver into Fadelli's face and or
dered him to throw up his hands. Fa
delli refused and Hogan, it is alleged,
struck him on the head with a bar
of iron, stunning him. When he re
covered his equilibrium he took ref
uge in flight.
The two young footpads thereupon
turned their attention to Long, who is
an old man. He was knocked down
by a blow on the head and his cries
for help scared the young rascals and
.they ran away without attempting to
rifle his pockets.
Fadelli informed Sergeant Cook and
Policeman Hayes of the attempted
hold-up and they reported.it to the
Harbor station. Sergeant Ellis and
Policeman McGowan were detailed on
the case and about 11 o'clock they
arrested Miles and Hogan at East and
Folsom streets. ' They were taken to
the Sailors' Home, where Miles was
identified as the "youth who had the
revolver and Hogan as the one who
had the iron bar.
The police say that Hogan was out
on probation from the Juvenile Court
on a Charge of burglary. He was sent
back to that court.

Apples and Grapes were the only . descrip

Tho supply and demand for Grapes about bal

no UrfTH boxÂ«s received from Martinez and the
quotations are withdrawn. The Apple market
was in fair shape, considering the heavy sup
plies on hand. Trade was confined chiefly to
high-grade stock and prices stood as previously
quoted. Pears. Â¦- Quinces and Persimmons were

Trade in Oranges was light, aa dealers were

Oranges from . the south are still , lacking In
color, and it was reported yesterday that quite
a quantity of well-colored Navels and- Tan-,
rerlncs, grown in the vicinity of Oroville. were
purchased for shipment to Los Angeles. The
steamer Senator, which arrived yesterday from
Victoria, brought down several consignments
of Japanese Mandarins, aggregating about 1000
boxes, which had be-^n purchased from the

NEW YORK. Dec. 15.â Except for the con
j sid^racle volume of dealings in one or two
I flocks to-day's market was dull and at times
I practically idle. The occasional pt-nods of
activity were buying movements for the first
part of the day, but prices elipjxrd back to
below last night's level before the closing, and
the cloying itseir was barely steady. During
the early periods of dullness holders of stock
seemod content to await the demand, and there
was no pressure ot offerings when- buyers
paufed in their operations. Amalgamated Cop-
W-r led the market In point of activity and
lifted 1"r at the top level. The strength and
activity of the London market for copper
seemed to be the inspiring cause of the buying
and ooppvr securities in other markets sympa
thized with the movement. Even United States
SteH preferred had seme share in the early
rtrÂ»ngth of the market, and the urgent borrow
ing demand for the stock for delivery pointed
to the necessity of a short Interest. The an
nouncement of the extensive economies contem
plated by the company were accepted as prom
ising well for the net earnings of the corpora
tion. The late reaction In the market, however,
centered in this stock, and its dron to over
a point below laft night's price upset the whole
marke-t. The passing of the dividend on Cru
cible Steel preferred was an Influence on the
stock, although that company is recognized as
the victim of troubles peculiar to Itself. The
pending meetings of the member* of the various
steel pools were subjects of Interested surmise
and Information of their probable action on the
eubjecl of maintaining present prices was hard
to gÂ»t. Rumors were heard of an intended cut
in the price of fteel rails and of difficulty In
holding the pool together, which may have
helred the weakness of United States Steel
preferred. The speculative element seemed to
have put aside any misgivings over the North
ern Securities case. It was argued that the
tÂ«>xt of the decision might serve to define the
legal I'mltatloM under which the purposes of
the merger could be accomplished and so clfar
up the present unstable condition on the mat
ter. Sterling exchange developed a very
strong tone on a strong demand for bills, which
was partly attributable to the need to cover
engagements of gold in London for import. Sev
eral hundred thcusand dollars additional was
engaged to-day and the first arrival of Jap
anese gold at San Francisco wat made available
to the New York banks bv telegraphic transfer.
The extraordinary showing of the country's
foreign trsde for November was studied with
satisfaction in the financial district. With an
Increase In value of export* over last year of
$35.<V)O.OOO nnd a decrease in value of imports
of $10,000,000. the powerful control of the In
ternational exchanges in favor of New York Is
mÂ«flÂ» ojear.
TV.nrf* were dull and steady. Total salts,
$1.7Rn.OOO.
UnitÂ«d States bonfls were unchanged on call.

Ther* Is now a fair movement In Hops, and
I during the past few days there have been
Mixnernus sales in Sonoma County, the move
ment being reported at 12OO bale*, at prices
I averaging 22c per lb for choice. It is esti
! mated that . not over 80o bale* remain unsold
in the county.' There has alÂ«o been consid
erable selling in OrÂ»gon and Washington, where
I the growers want to realize 1 to clo^ their
arcountH at the end of the year. It is re
ported that in the three Coast States there
are now only about 30.000 balea remaining in
growers' hands, while middlemen, commission
houses and speculators hold about 20.000 bales
rmore. The market 1st firmly . held; '. .

' port a firm market. During the past few

night, December 5.
Three musicians at the Chinese the

One of these musicians, Dare Fook,
swore to complaints before Police
Judge Fritz, charging the three men
Identified with murder, and they were
booked at the City Prison on the
charge.
Complaints against other wholesalers
who are still selling perishable products
on the State wharves will probably be
filed Boon. The entire matter will be
fought out ultimately in the courts.
The board directed Secretary Foy, In
each case, to call for each of the de
fendants to come before the board and
also to inquire if any one desired to
cross-examine the witnesses. No one
responded to these Invitations.
The commissioners settled down to
the consideration of what they should
do. They promptly revoked the selling
permits of the several firms named in
the foregoing. They also instructed
Attorney Davis and .Secretary Foy and
the chief wharfinger to carry Into effect
the orders of the board and prevent any
of the firms whose selling permits were
revoked from doing any more business
on the wharves of the State in this
city.
Secretary Foy called aloud the names
of the parties that were cited to ap r
pear. No one answered.
Attorney Reinstein went on reading
legal documents and made no response.
His attitude in behalf of the wholesale
produce men was outlined by the an
swer that had been submitted by him
In writing for each of the firms. No
testimony was brought In relative to
selling or refusing to sell perishable
products on the State wharves. Only
two witnesses appeared. These were
Nick Fundas, a retail dealer- in pro
duce on Third street, anc J. D. Graves
of 122 Ninth street.
Fundas testified in accordance with
the statements made by him In an affi
davit filed last week. The allegations
contained in the affidavit of Fundas and
also the affidavit of Graves were made
the basis of specific charges relative to
the refusal of wholesale dealers to sell
perishable products in their places of
business to Fundas and Graves on the
ground that these two persons were
not members of the Retail Fruit Deal
ers' Association.
Fundas testified that, he ,' had â¢ been
refused goods for which' he was ready
to pay the cash price at the 'Stores of
G. Berti & Co., Garcia & Maggini and
Mitchell & Goodall. Graves testified
to a like experience at the store of
Ivancovich & Co. >
If your board has any charge of violation of
said law by a refusal of the Â«ald firm to sell
puch products on State property we deny that
charge and are prepared to answer it upon ths
production of such a charge.
In reply to the charse made before eaid
board against Faid firm of violation of the law
referred to in said charge by a refusal to sell
jeriehable products at the place of business of
paid firm the said firm denies the right or Ju
risdiction of eaid board to Investigate or regu
late tales not on the property of the State of
California.
HEARING XEW CASES.
W r hen the proceedings before "the
Harbor Commissioners were opened
yesterday in the ferry building there
were very few persons present with the
exception of the commissioners, their
attorney and attaches of the board and
newspaper men. Attorney J. B. Reln
ste>n was present and paid strict at
tention to what was done In one case
and then went away. He took the
ground in an answer to the citations to
his clients to appear that the board had
no Jurisdiction to investigate or regu
late sales that do not take place on
the property of the State and also de
nied any charge of violation of the
Woodward law by refusal to sell per
ishable products on the State wharves.
The denial in the case of each firm
cited to appear was identical in sub
stance and was as follows:
The board then proceeded to consider the
evidence In the case, and after due considera
tion of the same found that said charges
against the plaintiff had been established by
the evidence and were true, and adjudged that
its said permit should be revoked and can
celed, and it then and there revoked and can
celed the same, with revocation and cancella
tion are the same complained of by plaintiff.
timony in said matter of said charges, where
upon the said John G. Wetmore and others
not parties to the proceedings were called as
witnesses, were questioned upon the subject
of raid charces and each made statements
enncrrnins the same and thereupon the tukinj."
of testimony was closed.
Later in the day Attorney Davis filed
the answer nf the Harbor Commission
ers in the Wetmore case. In this an
swer it was denied that the Wetn.ore
Bros, never received any notice of vio
lation of the Woodward law and of the
agreements contained in the permit is
sued to the firm by the Harbor Com
missioners.
"On the contrary," bo reads the an
swer, "prior to the cancellation of raid
permit they (the Harbor Commission
ers) gave to said plaintiff due notice
that it was c harged with a violation of
the agreements contained in its paid
application for said permit; and that
at a time and place stated in said no
tice said board would investigate such
charge and sive it a hearing; that such
notice and hearing: were duly g-iven
and had at Fame time and place so
noticed, as aforesaid."
Concerning the hearing that took
place just prior to the taking from
Wetmore Bros, of their permit to sell
on the State wharves, the answer says
In part:
That en December 3. 19C3, the eaid board
proceeded Trlih Fuch Investigation and hear
ir.K, said plaintiff appearing by its secretary,
John G. Wetmore. and its attorney, J. R.
F.einrteln: and other parties eharg-ed with
like violation of like agreements also appear
ing, the plaintiff and taid other parties pre
sented to and had r.led with this board their
Joint answer. That aftiÂ»r the reading 1 of eaid
tmwer the board proceeded to take tes-
Two rroves of interest were made
yesterday relating to the enforcement
of the Woodward law, the purpose of
which is to discourage discrimination
and conspiracy in the sale and purchase
cf perishable produce. The Harbor
Commissioners revoked the permits to
sell on the wharves of the State in this
city, earlier issued to L. G. Sresovich
& Co., Mitchell & Goodall, Ivancovich
& Co.. G. Berti & Co. and Garcia &
Magginl. wholesalers. The Commis
sioners last week revoked the permits
cf Wolf & Sons, Wetmore Brothers, L.
Bcatena & Co. and McDonough & Run
7cn. making altogether nine wholesale
firms that have lost their permits.
The four last named firms have se
cured from the Superior Court a tem
porary injunction to restrain the Har
bor Commissioners from interfering
with their selling perishable products.
Very likely the five firms that Io3t
their permits yesterday will also go
into court. Attorney W. H. Davis in
formed the Harbor Commissioners yes
terday of bis plan for meeting the
court proceedings already taken by the
wholesale produce dealers. He had pre
pared an answer to the suits in the Su
perior Court against the board in the
case of Wetmore Bros, and demurrers
in the cases of Wolf & Sons, L,. Sca
tena & Co. and McDonough & Runyon.
Attorney Davis explained to the Com
missioners that the matter at issue
could be reached more quickly by fil
ing an answer and pressing for an
early hearing than by moving directly
for a dissolution of the temporary in
junctions against the board. The Com
missioner? agreed with him and au
thorized him. on his own suggestion, to
associate with him in the case Judge
E. A. Davis and to request Attorney
General Webb to also *act with him in
defense of the Woodward law.

mencing with the performance next
Sunday afternoon. The regular attrac
tion, "The Little Outcasts-win beplay
ed by a New York company, but the
firemen will be the principal feature of
the bill.
Three flghtins men of the Hop Sing
tong have been positively identified' as
the murderers of Gee Gum, the musi-.
clan at the Chinese theater on Wash
ington street, shot and killed an Sat
urday night in. the presence of an au
dience of about 500 Chinese while play-
Ing in the orchestra on the stage.
The names of those arrested are Man
Lick, Lee Sem, alias Ah Hong, and
Louie Yow, alias Ah Wing. They were
arrested with four others in one room.
Late Monday night Detective George
McMahon and Sergeant Sylvester of
the Chinatown squad discovered that
several highbinders belonging to the
Hop Sing tong were making their head
quarters in a room in 'â¢ the building at
609 Dupont street. Yesterday morn
ing McMahon and Policemen Earle and
Owens of the Chinatown squad ' went
to the room and demanded admittance.
There was no response.
KNOCK HOLE IX WALL.
Owens and Earle were armed with
heavy sledge hammers and they tried
to batter down the door, but found
their efforts useless, a^ it was firmly
bolted and barred and covered with
sheet metal. They were determined
to force an entrance and attacked the
wall near the door with the sledge
hammers. The Chinese had made the
door much stronger than the wall and a
hole big enough for a man to crawl
through was soon made in the latter.
McMahon was the first to go through
the hole and he was followed by
Owens and Earle. Seven Chinese were
found in bunks, feigning to be asleep.
They were lined up against the wall
and searched, but no weapons were
found on them. A search was then
made of the room and a big revolver,
a Winchester rifle and a sandbag were
found. The search was continued and
under the flooring four more big re
volvers were found and two boxes of
cartridges. About fifty pawn tickets
were also discovered.
IDENTIFIED AS MURDERERS.
The police took possession of the
weapons and other articles and
marched the seven men, who were rec
ognized as notorious highbinders of the
Hop Sing tong, to the City Prison,
where they were placed In the tanks.
The names of the four not charged
with murder are Sup Poy, Louie Bing,
Lu Gin and How Soo Chy. The last
named Is a photographer at 17 Spofford
alley and it was in the doorway of his
place that a Sen Suey Ying man was
full view of the audience.
The second scene will show a three
story house on flre, with a squad of
Chief "Wittman's policemen handling
the crowds. The flre apparatus will get
to work, hose will be coupled, water
pumped, ladders and trucks run up and
everything done as at a real fire.
The most exciting part of the pro
gramme will be the "life-saving" scene.
Imprisoned men and women will be
brought down from the building by the
firemen, who will crawl up with Pom
pier scaling ladders. Women will jump
from the top of the building into life
saving nets held by the firemen and,
with the exception of the "stage
flames," the whole scene will be just
as real as the work done at a genuine
conflagration.
Chief Sullivan and Assistant Chief
Dougherty are working hard to make
the affair a success. The men and
horses are now training at the theater
and there will be a private rehearsal
next Friday for the press.
