the Government intended to send United States troops to the isthmus, but positive official denials were made that such was the intention of the administration, which, some time ago,
asserted its purpose to prevent fighting that would endanger free transit of the isthmus.

Detectives Martin was communicated
with. In response to the call Martin de
tailed Detectives Jerry Dinan. a&d Ed

the Stanyan-street Pol!cÂ« Station, which
is but a short distance away. Station
Keeper Dugan dispatched every avail

detailed were F. C. Krecke, John O*Shea
and George Clark. These officers rcda
along Hayes street for some distance and
were returning to the terminus when they
observed two men. standing la thÂ» shadow
of a telegraph pole near Clayton street.
ARREST TWO SUSPECTS*
Krecke and O'Shea slipped from the ear
and came upon the men unawares. Both
had their right hands in their pockets and
they were quickly seized and made prison
ers. It was found that each had re
volvers and ' that their fingers rested on
the triggers. The prisoners were taken
to tha Hayes-street carhouse and held

had been held up returned from their

asked if either had anything to do with

but Conductor Forrest would not bÂ« posi

gave the cania of Lester Good and tha
Both conductor and gripman were
startled and did not comply on the,in
stant. It passed through the conductor's
mind that the whole thins xnlzht be a
joke, but that Impression was soon
changed when the muzzle of the revolver
came closer to his head and In angry
tones the robber again, commanded both
to raise their hands and be quick about It.

"I guess you have," he said to the con

Forrest started to comply without ar
gument. He reached his hand Into his
pocket and drew out dollars, half-dollars,
quarters and coins of smaller denomina
tions. The robber took all of the money
and when the conductor's pockets were
emptied was about _to deposit it In his

tion cr any show of Irritation all ques- j

firm in the conviction that he had been }
deeply wronged by the man he had mur
dered.
He told a rambling story about a col
cred woman. Mrs. Bessie Davis, who. {
until about four months aeo, kept a lodg
ing-house for negroes in West Fifty-third
street, who, he said, haa circulated a
statement derogatory to his character,
and against whom he had been trying to
bring Â«utt for 133.000.
The tremble, he eaid, dated back to the
Â¦ year ISS5, when he was one of her lodgers.
; Her stories reached the congregation of
j the Mount Olivet Church, of which he
! was an attendant, and he was forced to
; give up his membership there because his>
', fellow-worshipers pointed the finger of
: scorn at him. Her slanders, continuing.
! he said, over eight years, cost him nearly
; all his friends. "I would have been mar- ;
ried now only for her." he added bitterly.
Continuing, he said he had not been ab!e
to find the woman, who had been spirited
away by powerful friends. He blamed
i Green for befriending the woman and en
Â¦ abling her to continue her slanderous sto
j ries. He said he had asked Green to "Get
; after her." but he had failed to do so.
PBOITD OF MURDER.
"I am not sorry I shot him." exclaimed
the prisoner. "He got what he deserved.
I may not" be justified by society, but I
i am justified in the eyes of God. I am
j willing to go to the electric chair if neces
; sary to vindicate my character."
Employes of the Murray Hill Hotel told
i the police that they had seen the colored
! man walking up and down the street in
I front of Green's house every day for the '
past week. They had heard him mutter- !
ing to himself and waving his hands about !
him. and decided that he was crazy.
Green," who -was a bachelor, lived with
his nephew, Timothy R. Green, and h!s
three nieces. Timothy R. Green said to
night that his uncle had never before seen
the man who shot him; that he had never
heard of the colored woman, Bessie Da
vis, and that he had never had any col
ored servants in his boose. The' story
told by Williams was, Â¦ said the nephew,
pure fiction.
No trace of the Davis woman could be
found. The police are disposed to believe
that the Davis woman ' was merely the
figment of an Insane Imagination.

was then ten* miles south of Cape Blanco
and about eight miles off shore. Her deck
load had been washed away, the aban
doned vessel was floating on a fairly even
keel and at first glance there appeared
little the matter with her. She was not
traveling, however, as goes a vessel con

her course is what attracted Captain
Hall's attention.

Chief Officer Austin carried a stout steel
hawser to the derelict Slow progress was
made at first, and shortly after nightfall
there developed a strong gale which kept
increasing in fury until early morning,

collier so that her big hull formed a wind

WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.â The State
Department has learned that Messrs?
Boyd, Amador and Arosn^gn, the com
missioners appointed by the Panama Gov
ernment to assist Minister Bunau-Varllla
in the negotiation of a canal treaty with
the United States, will arrive in New
York next Tuesday, In Washington the
following day. The treaty negotiations
are expected to begin formally at the mo
ment of their arrival here.
It is stated that the Panama Govern
ment favors the making of a perpetual
lease with the United States to cover a
canal stria ten miles wide across the
isthmus. It Is urged that this plan is
more politic than the original proposition
to . give the United States a fee simple
title to the land, a proceeding: which
would go far toward confirming the sus
picions of eotne of the South and Central
American countries respecting territorial
designs on the part of the United States.
It is expected that a call will be issued
next ' week for a constitutional conven
tion and that in thirty days the new Gov-^
ernment of Panama will be permanently
established under a constitution patterned
closely after that of Cuba. When this Is
done the President will accredit a Min
ister to Panama, but meanwhile work of
a diplomatic character will be intrusted
to Mr. Gudger, the Consul General at
Panama, who should reach that post
about next Monday.
Secretary Hay had a number of Con
gressional callers before the Cabinet meet

briefly the Panama situation, particular
ly with reference to possible action by

COMMISSIONERS EXPECTED.
In spite of oil and seamanship, however,
the derelict got away in the morning and
the Edith lay to for eleven hours, shelter
ing the waterlogged prize as much as pos
sible and watching for a chance to make
fast another line.
The second line'was in service yesterday
when the Edith brought her prize through
the north channel. Gales did their worst
on Tuesday and Thursday nights to rob
the Edith of her salvage. The steel haw
ser, the powerful collier and the seaman
ship of Captain Hall made an invincible
combination, which worked so well that
the Charles Nelson has been redeemed
from the list of the lost.
Captain Hall on Thursday afternoon
sent his son, William Hall, who is the
Edith's second mate, with three sailors
on board the derelict, and they remained
there, , watching the tow line until the
Charles Nelson" was safely anchored on
the flats of Mission Bay.
AH hands on board the collier were tired
out when the vessel reached port. Cap
tain Hall had had his clothes on since
Sunday morning. With sleep he had been
a stranger. His razor had been out *of
commission and the salt water and wind
had roughened and reddened his genial
countenance until the surface cracked
every time the skipper smiled. The barber
that shaves Captain Hall will earn his
money and the operation will not have
much of pleasure for the mariner, but he
will not mind a little thing like that' in
view of the substantial consolation he will
derive from cashing the check for his
share of the salvage.
The amount of the salvage will depend
upon the condition In which the surveyors
find the Charles Nelson. If her machinery
Is in good condition the owners of the
Edith may receive as much as $30,000. How
much of that will be distributed between
Captain Hall and the other members of
the Edith's craw', depends upon the own
ers' generosity. Representatives of the
underwriters boarded the Edith yesterday
and received Captain Hall's report of .his
experiences with the derelict. They made
a hasty inspection of the waterlogged
Nelson, but will postpone their official
examination of the vessel until she is dry
docked.
fused to appropriate even the small sura
necessary to secure the cutting of the
fever laden brush in the immediate vi
cinity of the isthmian port. Government
officials stationed at the isthmus, even
the men who collected the republic's rev
enues, had difficulty in getting even a
portion of their salaries, and it Is years
since a soldier stationed on -the isthmus
has received a cent of pay. The people
were tired of the burden and when the
Colombian Government refused to ratify
the canal treaty the isthmus decided to
strike for Its independence.
PANAMA'S FEAR AUjAJYED.

COLON. Nov. 13.-Cutters from the
American warships here were dispatched
this morning to stop the German steamer
Markomannia, which was seen two miles
off towing a launch toward the harbor.
It was thought that the Markomannia
was coming from a Colombian port but
it appears that she had been chartered
at Â¦ Bocas del Toro to bring: the Alcalde
of that port to Colon. There was a big
scare at BocaÂ« del Toro , on * the receipt
of the news via Port Limon, Costa Rica,
that the Colombian ! Government was
sending 5000 troops to retake the port
which had recently declared its allegiance
to the new republic; and the Alcalde left
on ; the ; Markomannia for â¢ Colon ; for the
purpose of obtaining arms and ammuni
tion with which to equip 500 volunteers

to resist the expected Colombian attack.
The Alcalde, however, has returned to
Bocaa del Toro to allay the fears of the
populace and to give assurance that the
landing of Colombian troops there will
not be permitted.
The naval collier which arrived here
yesterday has gone to Porto Bello to coal
the United States gunboat Nashville. It
is expected that the Nashville will re
turn to Colon to-morrow. The cruiser At
lanta will sail to-night, and it la under
stood she will go to Bocas.del Toro. The
Mayflower has not arrived.
This part of the programme was
outlined to The Call to-night by one
of the minority leaders. The Demo
crats say Secretary Hay's announce
ment that the action taken was for
the world's pood will not bear analy
sis in view of the precise wording of
the Spooner canal act. They insist
that the President was not obliged
Xo recognize the new republic because
it was not a question of canal or
no canal. It was only a question of
routes, and the Congress wisely put
in an alternative proposition to meet
difficulties which arose when Colom
bia neglected to ratify the treaty.
Senator Hanna, who is to be chair
man of the Senate Committee on
Interoceanic Canal to succeed Mor
pan, and who was at the White
House conference last night, said to
night:
"I still hope that this will not be
made a party question, but if it is to
be made such we will be ready for
those who are, for the sake of occupy
ing a position of obstruction, willing
to prevent any canal at all."
Secretary Hay is the administra
tion's most effective whip in the sit
uation. If the Democrats organize
to oppose the canal treaty they will
at least be able to block its ratifica
tion for a long time. Secretary Hay
is resolved not to send another treaty
to the Senate unless he is sure it will
escape the fate of the first Hay-
Paunccfote convention. So it is
practically certain tbat although the
negotiations of a new canal treaty
are eure to be quickly concluded, it
will not be sent to the Senate for ac
tion until the administration is sure
of its ratification.
Senators Bacon of, Georgia and
Cockrell of Missouri, 1 credited with
being radically opposed to tne admin
istration's Panama policy, were both
at the Department of State this
morning. The desire of the South
to have some canal built quickly is a
point on which the.Premier lays much
stress in his talKs with Southern
Democrats, whose support must be
obtained if the treaty is ratified.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.âWhat
ever Colombia may do, whether the
question comes up in Congress at
once or at the regular session, it is
certain there will be a fierce and mem
orable struggle over the administra
tion's action in recognizing the new
republic of Panama. Democrats and
Republicans alike are preparing for
the fray, and all the influence of the
administration will be used to break
the ranks of the Democrats.
The Democratic leaders are on fire
for the present and they wish to see
the correspondence for which Con
gress called before they finally deter
mine their position. It is known,
however, to a practical certainty and
not denied by a single Democrat in
Congress, that the roinority will con
test the issue at e\-ery possible step.
They wiil not only oppose the offi
cial acts of the Government in what
they call at present the "most re
rnarkable diplomatic incident in the
history of the world," but will criti
cize unofficial acts and alleged re
marks of members of the administra
tion and partisans of the Panama

THE HAGUE. Nov. 13.â The Venezuelan
arbitration tribunal to-day adjourned sine

ed. The court will consider Its decision
and will notify those interested of the
date of its delivery.
The closing proceedings were brief. Re

explaining 1 the blockading provisions in
the protocol of February 13, abandoned
all claims for preferential treatment. The
United States, he declared, would remain

though the decision rendered is unfavor
able to America.
The tribunal announced that complete

"I feel that I express the wish of Â¦ my
countrymen in assuring you and through
you the people of the republic of Panama
of our earnest | hope and desire : that sta
bility and prosperity shall attend the new
state and that in harmony with the Unit
ed States it may be the providential in
strument of ' untold benefit to the civil
ized world through the ; operation of a
highway of universal commerce across
"This way from Europe to Asia, follow
ing the pathway of the sun, is now to be
realized. The early attempts to find such
a way unexpectedly resulted In the great
est of all historic achievements, the dis
covery of America. Centuries have since
rolled by, but the pathway sought has
hitherto resulted in the realm, of dreams.
To-day. Mr. President, In response to
your summons, it becomes a reality."
In response President Roosevelt said:
"Mr. Minister, I am much gratified to
receive the letters whereby you are ac
credited to the Government of the United
States in the capacity of Envoy Extraor
dinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of
the republic of Panama. Â¦ .:.-..Â¦ .
"In accordance with its long established
rule, this Government has taken cogniz
ance of the act of the ancient territory of
Panama in asserting, the right of self
control, and seeing In the recent events
on the isthmus an unopposed expression
of the will of. the people of Panama and
the confirmation of their declared inde
pendence by the Institution of a de facto
government, republican in form and spir
it, capable and resolved to discharge the
obligations pertaining to sovereignty, we
have entered into relations with the new
republic. It is fitting that we should do
so now, as we did nearly a century ago,
when the Latin peoples proclaimed the
right of popular government, and It is
equally fitting that the United States
should be the first to stretch out the hand
of fellowship and to extend to the new
state the rules of equal Intercourse that
regulate the relations of sovereignties
toward one another.
"It owes itÂ« existence to the outburst
of the indignant grief which stirred the
hearts of the citizens of the isthmus on
beholding the despotic nation which
sought to forbid their country from ful
filling the "Oestinies vouchsafed to it by
providence. In consecrating its right to
exist, Mr. President, you put an end to
what appeared to be the interminable con
troversy as to the rival waterways and
you definitely Inaugurated the era of the
achievement of the Panama canal.
. "From this time forth the determination
of the future of the canal depends on two
elements alone, now brought face to face,
singularly unlike as regards their author
ity and power but wholly equal in their
common and ardent desire to see at last
the accomplishment of the heroic enter
prise for piercing the mountain barrier of
the Andes.
Secretary Hay formally presented M
Eunau-Varilla to President Roosevelt as
the accredited Minister of the republic of
Panama. Minister Bunau-Varilla in pre
senting his credentials delivered a brief
address, to which the President feelingly
responded. The exchange of addresses
was impressive by reason of the circum
stances and the addresses themselves are
regarded as felicitous and patriotic. Min
ister Bunau-Varilla spoke as follows:
"Mr. President: In according to the
Minister Plenipotentiary of the republic
of Panama the honor of presenting to
you his letters of credence you admit
into the family of nations the weakest
and the last born of the republics of tho
new world.
The Berlin Clinical Worchenschaft con
firms the statement of the doctors that
the operation on Emperor William was
for a harmless polypus. It is learned
from Bonn that Prince Henry of Prussia,
in a conversation with Burgomaster Spi
ritus, declared that the illness of the Em
peror was not at nil serious. Were it so,
Prince Henry says, the Emperor would
have revealed the truth to the people.
At a meeting of the Laryngological So
ciety, to-night Professor Schmidt was
greeted enthusiastically, the members
rising as he entered. The president of the
Bociety, Professor Frankel, congratulated
Professor Schmidt on the success of his
operation on the Emperor. Professor
Schmidt, in reply, said that the operation
was not concluded with any special view
to the exalted position of the subject.
When he put the knife to the Emperor's
larynx he forgot, as far as the operation
was concerned, who his high patient was.
\ arilla's young eon. Secretary Hay and
the new Minister, both attired in con
ventional morning dress, entered the
White House, accompanied by the Min
ister's Bon, and were shown into the blue
room. They were joined almost immedi
ately by the President and Secretary
Loeb.
Dr. Schmidt remains at the new palace
to make a more particular examination
of the wound by the laryngoscope and
sprinkle the wound. The Emperor is for
bidden to rise, epeak or to eat seasoned
foods and drinks. The feeling- at the pal
ace is nevertheless quite cheerful.
The result of the microscopic examina
tion was in the hands of the Emperor
and his physicians after six hours from
the operation. This unexcelled record in
rapid induration, coloring and preparing
of microscopic segments is due to a new
invention of Professor Orth, which was
used for the first time and is unknown
outside the immediate circle of his med
ical friends. The invention Is a very
rapid process of indurating tissues for
microscopic investigation where reasons
of jurisprudence require the speediest pos
sible determination of facts.
The Frankfurter Zeitung prints the fol
lowing details of the Emperor's operation,
obtained partly from Dr. Schmidt, who
belongs to Frankfort:
"The polypus had no stem, as usually
is the case, but spread itself on the edge
of the lelt vocal chord. For this reason
the Emperor's case was more complicated
than with an ordinary vocal chord poly
pus, inasmuch as it required cutting
around to make a stem. Cocaine took
effect on the patient excellently, so that
Dr. Schmidt could use a laryngal knife
with precision and separate the polypus
from the adjacent tissue with the excep
tion of a slight ligament. He inserted a
laryngal forceps and extracted the whole
polypus in the first effort.
"The operation made no disturbing mo
tion. The bleeding wa3 somewhat pro
fuse, but it did not require important
treatment to check. At first the vocal
chord was inflamed and reddish before
the operation, and it took considerable
time to restore the normal condition. Such
an affection of the chord is nothing un
usual. It is no Eign of a more serious
condition."
POTSDAM, Prussia, Nov. 13.â The fol
lowing bulletin was issued this morning:
"The healing of his Majesty's wound is
proceeding in bo satisfactory a manner
that the next bulletin will be issued the
day after to-morrow."

LOUISVILLE, Colo., Nov. 13.â As a re-r

strike in the southern coal fields, on the
condition that, if that strike terminated
without granting an eight-hour day by
the southern operators, the men should

CHETENNE, Wyo., Nov. 13.â In an In
terview this evening Governor Chatterton
made public the result of his investiga-
I tions during his recent trip to Central
Wyoming in regard to the responsibility
! for the Sioux outbreak.
The Governor ascertained that shortly
before the fight It was reported te Sheriff
Miller at Newcastle that a band of Sioux
Indians were not only illegally hunting
; game along the border of Weston and
! Converse counties, but were also slaugh
j tering cattle of the ranchmen. These re
ports were so authentic that the Sheriff
i organized a posse of six men and started
! on a search for the Indians, meeting them
on the dry fork of the Cheyenne river.
When the officers first reached the Indian
camp the bucks were out hunting. Upon
their return the Sheriff demanded their
' surrender. Some of the Indians were will
! Ing to come in, but others were not, the
i latter saying- that they were under Char
ley Smith, or Eagle Feather, his Sioux
name. Smith became defiant when the
Sheriff told him that the Indians were
', violating the law and replied that Miller
had not men enough to take them. He
then ordered his party to break camp.
As they started the Sheriff and his posse
went with them for some distance, urging
them to surrender and submit to the law.
Smith refused and the Sheriff retired and
added five ranchmen to his party. The
Sheriff again overtook the Indians on
Lightning Creek the day after about sun
set- Demand was made upon the Indians
to halt and surrender. This was repeated
three times, when the Sioux opened flre.
the officers replying immediately. The
Indians fled es soon as they saw that
some of their party were shot.
The Governor states that there can be
no question as to where the responsibil
ity lies. The Indians were violating the
laws of the State of Wyomingâknowing
ly and willfullyâ and the murdered officers
were martyrs to their duty.
The Governor declared that he would
Insist on a thorough trial, If for no other
reason than to vindicate the dead officers
and present their sacrifice in proper light
before the people.

CHICAGO, Nov. 13.â Twenty-ftve cars
run en the Wectworth-avenue line with
out damage to the cars or injury to the
cor.-ur.ion employes operating them was
â¢what the Chicago City Railway Company
was able to accomplish to-day, Â¦with the
E.5sistÂ£nce of the Police Department. The
rars were run at three different times,
leaving the Seventy-seventh-street barns
at 6:30 a. m.. ten leaving at 10 :Â« and ten
at 3:30. in the first two runs the round
trip was made in about three hours; in
the third, in about one and a half hours,
the usual time. During the entire trip, a
distance cf ovfr eight miles, only one
missile was thrown.
While there was no active interference
with the handling of the cars, such as at
tended the attempts to run cars yester
day, the crowds that lined the streets
;*ered and booted the police and the non
cstoa men almost without intermission.
But two stones were hurl^vi at the cars
during tr.e <iay. one being thrown by a
Â¦woman, who made her escape in the
crowd before the police could reach her,
end the other being hurled from the new
joEtcffice building now being built.
Neither stone did damajre worth mention
ing.
At nightfall the officials of the street
car ffflnpany were inclined to view the
day's work as being successful and on
the whole satisfactory. They announced
that cars would be run to-morrow on the
V.'tntworth-avf-r.ue lire at the same hours
as to-day, end that attempts Â¦would bÂ«
made to operate other lines which were, ;
however, not specified.
FIE.E3IEK" WALK OUT.
Shortly after this decision was an
nounced the situation was complicated for i
th< company by a sudden strike of the ;
Cresses employed in all six power houses j
owned by the company.
Tb* Firemen's Union made an ajrree
rr.-r.t two days ago with the company f
which was to last for a year. There was i
a clause in the contract, which gave the;
firemen the discretion to go on a sympa-
tr.etic strike if the company declined to ;
arbitrate with the employes now on i
Ftr:ke. The company explained its atti- !
tude en arbitration and said that it had j
always been willing to arbitrate the ques- j
t:on of wages.
The f.renv=n then signed the contract, ;
m-hich uas repudiated to-night. The of- '
ricrals of the Firemen's Union declared .J
that they had ordered the strike because ;
the company had declined their offer to
m*diate between the company and the ;
employes now en strike.
The calling out cf the firemen involves
cilers, water tenders, coal passers, ash '
handlers, ccal and supply inen, 230 in
all. The real danger in this last strike !
lies in the attitude of the teamsters. They j
may decline to deliver coal to the com- !
pasy if non-union firemen are employed j
and the company has but three days" I
supply on han-J.
ARBITRATION PROPOSED.
During the afternoon an effort was !
rr.c<2e to bring about a peaceable adjust- i
ment of the strike. The members of the |
State Beard of Arbitration called upon !
Manager McCulIcch and upon the latter's â¢
HSCeation went into conference with H. J
R. Bliss, counsel for the company, with '
the hope of arranging a settlement, cr at '
least a conference between the strikers !
and the cfScials cf the road. Nothing ]

The trip planned would consume several
months and would be on the order of
General Woods' pleasurable Jaunt to the
Philippines. Secretary Root, is now con
sidering the request. It is strongly sus
pected that the real purpose of General
Carter Is to postpone his arrival in the
Philippines until General Wade, now In
command there, has been relieved.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.â Brigadier
General W. H. Carter of the general staff
of the army, who was temporarily ap
pointed to that body when it was organ
ized with the understanding that he was
to go to the Philippines in December In
accordance with his own request made
several months ago, has asked that in
stead of being sent direct to the archi
pelago he be assigned to make an exten
sive tour of Europe to study military
problems.
His amended request was made directly
to Secretary Root o%-er the head of Lieu
tenant General Young, chief of staff, and
has brought to light a smoldering but
bitter row within the general staff.
There has been a disturbing element in
the general 'staff from the day it was or
ganized and the charge has been freely
made that it was General Carter's bicker
ings and rows that soon became too
much for General Corbin and he got out
by asking to be allowed to change places
at once with General Chaffee, then com
manding the Department of the East, who
is to be the next chief of staff.

YOUNG BRIDE
KILLS HERSELF
The facts were brought out during an
examination in the case of Mrs. Annie
Armitage Park Hilton against TV. S. Mc-
Cornick. Mrs. Hilton was once sealed for
eternity to Dr. C. H. Park. She afterward
married William Hilton for time. On Dr.
Park's death she sued for a widow's In
terest in the estate despite her second
marriage. The property, amounting to
about $40,000. had been bequeathed to the
University of Utah, but the Supreme
Court decided that "sealing for eternity"
constitutes lawful wedlock and she was
entitled- to her dower right. The suit
against McCornick. a trustee of the es
tate, is a sequence. Elder Penrose was
placed on the stand by N. V. Jones, a
Mormon,, attorney for Mr3. Hilton, to ex
plain the rite of sealing and its signifi
cance.
This and similar testimony is likely to
be used In the Senate's investigation of
the Qualifications of Senator Reed Smoot
to occupy the seat to which he has been
elected.
Elder Charles W. Penrose, editor of the
church organ, the Desert -News, declared
"celestial marriages" are being performed
daily by church authorities and that co
habitation under these marriages is not
considered unlawful. According' to the
laws of the church, as expounded, there
are . three forms of marriage. The first
is for both time and eternity, the .common
form of wedlock. This is supposed to> last
durinc ; the existence on this earth and
throughout the life In another sphere.
The second Is the marriage for time only,
lasting for the life on earth and ceasing
with death. The third is the "sealing"
.for eternity only. According to the teach
ing's of the church a person may be
"sealed" to one mate for "time" and an
other for "eternity," the second relation
ship beginning where the first leaves off
âat death. But Elder Penroso testified
that the celestial relationship cften be
came of a decidedly earthly character and
that pairs thus joined some times even
now live together on this earth as hus
band and wife, regardless of other nup
tial ties

NEW YORK. Nov. IXâ R. G. Dun &

to-morrow:
Chief among the depressing features
brought to light this week are the re
ports that finished steel products kava
been cut, that wages of iron and steel
and cotton mill employes must coma
down, and that some new strikes, notably
a general shutdown of Colorado coal
mines, are menacing Far Western, manu
facturing and railway activity. On thÂ»
other hand the fact might aa well bÂ«
faced that high prices have checked de
mand, that manufacturers of lroa and
steel believe that the demand can be re
vived if price concessions are made and
that the wage reductions are calculated
to render this policy more effectual, not
withstanding that a decrease in earnings
and consumptive power results tem

PEBjSONAL MENTION.
The Injunction which, for the last two
years has prevented Â¦ the Board of Su-,.
pervlsors from enforcing Â¦ its ordinance
prohibiting burials in Laurel Hill Cem
etery, was dissolved yesterday by Judge
Hebbard. The motion to dissolve the in
junction was mado by Attorney Garret
McEnerney and Assistant City Attorney
Sims, both of whom contended that the
recent decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of the Odd Fellows' Cemetery,
declaring the ordinance valid, practically
decided the case at bar.
Acting on the advice contained in a
communlcaticn frem City Attorney Lane,
the Board of Health stopped issuing cer
tificates for burials in Laurel Hill Cem
etery at noon yesterday. Lane said that
owing to the dissolving of the Injunction
by Judge 'Hebbard there were no legal
proceedings pending which would prevent
the enforcement of the ordinance prohib
iting burials in the city limits.

During a spell of absent-mindedness this
afternoon Mrs. Frances Weir, wife of
William K. Weir, First Ward represent
ative on the Board of Education, walked
in front of a Southern Pacific local train
at Berkeley station and received injuries
from which she died immediately. The
engine struck the unfortunate woman a
terrific blow upon the head, fracturing the
Â¦skull and knocking her under the wheels,
so that the engine and four cars passed
_over her body.
The tragedy occurred at 2:50 o'clock, at
which hour the local train was drawing
into the station. Mrs. Weir was crossing
Shattuck avenue with some bundles in
her arms, making in the direction of the
street cars then standing at the corner
of Center street. She was apparently pre
occupied and to spectators who saw her
danger did not seem to hear the ap
proaching train. She was in the middle
of the tracks when the engine thundered
down upon and crushed her beneath it.
After striking her down the train passed
over her and mangled the body fright
fully. .* â¢
Besides her husband Mrs. Weir leaves
two childrenâ Miss Louette Weir, a senior
at the Berkeley High School, and Robert
Weir, a civil engineer in the employ of the
Southern Pacific Company in Nevada
County. She was 40 years old and a na
tive of Illinois. The family lately changed
their residence to 1604 Scenic avenue. No
arrangements for the funeral have yet
been made.

Mr. McClymonds stated that the Juve

parental school is needed. In many.coun

enforced in Oakland. The truant officer,'
who is the principal of the evening school;
has already 6aved forty-three boys and

what children are delinquent. . He goes
immediately to each child's home to as
certain the reason. Â¦ >. .
The civic department of the California
Club is inaugurating a vigorous campaign
to enforce the new Juvenile court. The
first necessity is to see that the new com
pulsory education law is obeyed. ,_ .
On last Wednesday morning the depart

of the law by Professor J. W. McCly
monds, superintendent of the Oakland
public schools. Professor McClymonda
said that many do not understand that
the law is intended for children, who have
outgrown parental and are ' defiant of
school authority.
The ideal truant officer should be some
one loving, kind and who does not use
force unless absolutely necessary; in fact,
one who has the same qualities ' that a
good teacher possesses.
The California Club will hold an open
meeting on next Tuesday afternoon, when
the subject of "Juvenile Delinquency in
San Francisco" will be discussed by Miss
Landa Stebbens, Juvenile court officer of

The body of John Gerlach, a cabinet
maker, was found within a hundred yards
of his home at Third and Oilman streets
at daylight this morning by the crew of
the West Berkeley local train. Gerlach's
watch was stopped at 7 o'clock, and it is
believed he was killed at that hour last
night while on his way home. Just how
he was killed is a mystery that will prob
ably never be cleared up. Whether the
man was struck by the train while walk
ing along the tracks or fell off the train
in front of the 'wheels nobody knows.
The body was badly mangled, the head
being cut open, both legs fractured be

The. dead man was a native of Germany
and 60 years old. He leaves a widow and
two children. The Coroner will hold an

The Stevenson Fellowship Club, organ
ized by the friends and admirers of the
late Robert Louis Stevenson for the pur
pose of perpetuating the memory of the
famous writer, held its third annual ban
quet at the California Hotel last even
ing. The guests and members of the club
assembled early in the evening in Ports
mouth square, and after decorating the
Stevenson monument they adjourned to
the main dining-room of the California
Hotel, where, under the direction of
Chairman Alexander Sutherland of Oak
land, the ceremonies were carried out.
President David Starr Jordan of Stanford
University acted as toastmaster and de
livered an address, in which he eloquently
referred to the literary achievements of
the late author. The rest of the interest
ing programme was as follows:
George Querbeck was arrested yester
day afternoon on East street by. Police
man J. F. Mackey for the murder of
Mrs. Annie Wilson on the evening of No
vember 1 at 5 Capp street.
From the time of the unfortunate wom
an's death up to the hour of his arrest
Querbeck had been In hiding. He ven
tured out. only to bo seized for the brutal
crime laid at his door. Then, his nerve
falling him, he confessed that It was he
that left the black marks found on the
woman's dead body and that It was he,
angered at her final rejection of his suit,
in a moment of brutal ferocity, de
stroyed the wedding gown she had prom
ised to wear when she plighted her troth.
Mrs. Wilson was found dead in her
rooms on the evening of Querbeck'a last
visit to her home. She was lying on the
floor with all her clothing torn from her
body and several contusions established
the fact that she had been kicked to
death. She was engaged to marry Quer
beck and he had bought her a trousseau.
This was found cut to pieces when the
body was discovered. The autopsy show
ed that the woman had died of fatty de
generation of the heart, but shock from
the beating she received was' given as
the Immediate cause of her death.
Since then the ' police searched for
Querbeck. He remained In hiding and
shaved off his mustache to conceal his
identity. It was known that he had been
engaged to marry Mrs. Wilson and had
given her the wedding dress. When she
broke the engagement he demanded the
return of his presents. It was In an ef
fort to recover the marriage dress that he
inflicted the violence on the woman that
now forms the basis of the murder
charge. /
"When I was bending over to get some
of my things," he said when placed in a
cell, "she hit me on the back of the head.
I then got up and we engaged in a fight.
She was screaming and kicking all the
time. I did not intend to "hurt her when
I fought with her. . I knocked her down
and kicked her several times while she
was on the floor. Then I destroyed the
wedding gown and left the house,"
The friends of the home filled the house
very well and applauded enthusiastically
at the cleverness manifested by the chil
dren. No pleasanter amateur perform
ance by children has been given in the
city. Fcr the most part the children did
about as well as those who have had more
stage experience. This afternoon a mati
nee performance will be Riven. This even
ing "Dream Faces" will be performed.
In addition to the worthy motive sup
plied by a desire to aid the home attend
ants will be amply rewarded by what
they seÂ« and hear at both entertainments.
There were numerous ballets, a large
number of soncrs, many pretty costumes
and much pretty acting. Marguerite and
Rosalind Marx appeared in the quarrel
scene from "The School for Scandal,"
and made It Quite amusing. Little Nina
Frellsen showed her skill in toe dancing.
The "Flower and Storm Fantasy" was
performed by the older girls and boys.
A good orchestra was strongly and effec
tively in attendance.

LIST OF PBETTY DOLLS.
The entire performance hinged on the
rendering by the children and their adult
assistants of "A Day and a Night in a
Doll :Shop," which was adapted from the
German. "Die Puppenfee." George Denl
eon was the shopkeeper, Ed C. Wynne
the maid. Dr. Sieberst the Dutchman and
Charles Logan the expreesman and letter
carrier.
The children that participated were at
least two score In number and they
ranged in ace from very tender child
hood upward to misses and lads in the
higher gTa<JpÂ« of the grammar schools.
The charm particularly of the Ingenuous
ness of children was a great attraction.
No Email amount of labor was needed
to train the dancers and Elngers and to
contrive to make the many scenes in
which they appeared duly eatisfactory.
Miss Jean Logran was credited on the pro
gramme with the preparation of the en
tertainment. It did hÂ«r credit, and the
same general praise might be fairly ap
plied to "all those that were on the stage.
A v>ry pleasing entertainment was given
la*t evening In Lyric Hal!, on Eddy street,
for the brneflt of the Protestant Episco
pal Old Ladles" Home. The performance
*u in very large part Ly children of
the several Episcopal churches in the
city, but adults gave efficient assistance
on the Ftagp and in the preparation for
the event.
"The Presldent,has deemed the subject
of sufficient importance to convene an
extra session of Congress In order that
the convention, may become effective be
fore the commencement of the harvest
of the new sugar crop in December.
"This explanation will result in no harm
to any American industry. The product
of this country, like the articles embraced
in this convention now Imported from
Cuba, receive the very highest protection
of any in the same schedule. The duty
on sugar was placed above the protective
point- for the purpose of revenue. The
bill provides for a reduction in the in
terest of reciprocal trade agreement,
which it authorized the President to
make. The duty on tobacco has fcr years
been much higher than, any necessity re
quired on account of the competition of
Cuban tobacco. The reduction in this bill
leaves It amply protected."
The report closes with an argument
setting forth the advantages to both this
country and Cuba which will result from
a reciprocal arrangement provided in the
legislation.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13.-The House
Committee on Ways and Means to-day
authorized a favorable report on the bill
making effective , the Cuban reciprocity
treaty by a vote of 14 to 2. Metcalf (Re
publican) of California was present but
did not vote, , and Robertson (Democrat)
Of Louisiana and Cooper (Democrat) of
Texas voted against the bill.
Two amendments were offered in com
mittee, but both were rejected by the Re
publican vote. One extended the provi
sions of the treaty to all other countries.
The other abolished the differential duty
on refined sugar. The report says:
"The enactment of the bill into law Is
necessary to give effect to the convention
providing for reciprocal trade between
this country and Cuba. This results not
merely because the convention itself pro
vides that it 'shall not take effect until
the same shall have been approved by
the Congress,' but because the constitu
tion gives no power to the President and
the Senate to make a convention or treaty
changing the rates of revenue. That
power is now expressly lodged in Con
gress. It is not Intended here to cite au
thorities or advance reasons on this prop
osition. The records of Congress abound
with unrefuted arguments on the affirma
tive of this- connection, and the practice
of Congress has been uniformly in the
same direction.
Dr. A. J. Knox telephoned to the Soci
ety for the Prevention of Cruelty, to Ani
mals and Special Offlctr McGTurria an
swered the call. The Board cf Public
Works was in turn communicated with
and a barrier was placed about the dan
gerous BpoL Later In the day It was
found where the contact came from and
the defect was remedied.
About * five minutes afterward a milk
wagon, owned by Witt Bros., and drawn
by two horses, approached and the ani
mal to the left dropped to the street
as soon as it came in contact with the
water. The driver Immediately \ set the
brake and jumped to the ground. As In
the case of the first, animal that felt the
force of the current the horse lay mo
tionless, but had been dragged away from
the pool by Its mate. When the horse re
vived and was assisted to Its feet the driv
er reached up to release the brake and re
ceived a shock that threw him several
feet away. He did not lose consciousness
and in a few minutes was abla to drive
away. â¢
As early as C o'clock In the morning
canines ran howling about the streets
after they had stepped on the moist
ground near the pool, but the cause of
their torture was not known. Finally a
youth, riding a 'horse, came along, and
the animal stepped with his front feet
Into the water. Instantly he was thrown
to the ground and the lad was pitched
several feet away. For a time the horse
lay as If dead, but soon recovered and
was led off.
A pool of water over an electric wire
conduit at the corner of Mason and Ellis
streets became a menace to life yester
day morning. Several dogs, two horses
and a man received severe shocks, but no
fatalities resulted.

Victor took the young inventor in the
royal automobile, after which he further
honored him by taking him into Pisa and
leaving him at the Grand Hotel, where
the inventor is staying. The King and
Marconi were recognized and given a
great reception by the people.
ROME, Nov. 13.â Signor Marconi ar
rived at Pisa to-day to superintend the
arrangements for the erection there of a
powerful wireless telegraph station, which
is to communicate with the Argentine
republic. The station is to be erected on
the royal estate, near the King's hunting
lodge at San Rossore.
TRAIN KILLS
DAZED WOMAN
The young woman was taken in charge
by Matron Reed, and ten minutes after
the physician had finished his work Miss
Coffin was singing blithely and chatting
merrily with other inmates of the wom
en's department.
She refused to talk about the occurrence
except to say:
"I *-as so despondent over being taken
to jail again that I did not care what be
came of me."
Arrested several weeks ago for way
ward conduct, Miss Coffin, though barely
17 years old, has proved a puzzle to the
authorities and to a number of benevo
lent women who have tried to induce her
to forsake the paths of pleasure that
have been eo alluring to the headstrong
miss. Beyond the control of a heart
broken mother, the girl has defied all ef
forts at her reform. During a few weeks
of probation Miss Coffin has persisted in
her refusal to remain under the family
roof-tree. Hence her arrest last night.
Police Judge Mortimer Smith held an
interview with the young woman to-day,
but has not decided what action to take
concerning the case.
George Omerod, a boy who has a record
of fourteen charges of fighting and other
disturbance registered against him at po
lice headquarters, decided this afternoon
that he would rather die than serve the
four months' sentence imposed upon him
this morning In the Police Court. In the
midst of a crowd of other prisoners the
boy stood on a chair in a large cell,
wrapped a blanket around his head and a
gas fixture and turned on the flow. Not
one of Omerod's fellow prisoners made an
effort to restrain the youth, because they
were afraid he would give them a hard
battle. But the bravest among the lot
set up a tremendous yelling that warned
the Jailers of something wrong.
' Omerod was dragged to the open air
and resuscitated by the City Physician.
Miss Gertrude Coffin, pretty but way
ward, was the first of. the pair to at
tempt to end what was to her a miser
able existence. Wretched because she had
been ordered back to jail, the girl turned
on the eas in the captain's office at the
City Prison, where she had been tempor
arily detained. The jail officers do not
think the girl could have accomplished
much in the direction of self-destruction
because there was an open window In the
room and the gas escaped almost as rap-
Idly as it poured from the open burner.
Miss Coffin had not been in the room ten
minutes before an officer noticed the odor
of escaping gas, and quickly went to the
office and shut off the key. City Physi
cian von Adelung -was called and speedily
revived the desperate girl, who had, ac
cording to the police, simulated uncon
sciousness.
The suicide germ worked overtime to
day at the City Prison, a pair of despond
ent prisoners coincidently 17 years of age.
one a boy the other a girl, trying to es
cape earthly woes by gas Inhalation. That
both" the city's wards failed of their pur
pose was due to speedy action on the part
of the attendant jailers.

ASTORIA. Ore., Nov. 13.â Local salmon
packers are elated over the announce
ment from Washington that Senator Ful
ton has Introduced a bill making it a
misdemeanor to falsely label salmon or
other fish caught In any of the States. In
the past Pacific Coast salmon has â¢ been
falsely labeled to an alarming extent. It
has been the practice of unscrupulous
dealers to bring salmon to this city in
unlabeled cans and here to label the fish
with brands which would convey the as
surance that the salmon "was packed on
the Columbia River. Usually these false
labels have contained the name Astoria,
and this city being the center of the sal
mon Industry, the inferior product has
brought a much higher price than other
wise would have been realized. It is not
ah uncommon sight to see dozens of per
sons, whites and Chinese, at woVk on local
docks placing labels on canned salmon
shipped in from coast streams.
The more daring of the fraudulent lab
els announce that the packing-houses are
located at Astoria, while other labels bear
a fictitious canning company's name.
Hundreds of thousands of cases of sal
mon have thus been labeled.
The fraud is perpetrated at Astoria,
Portland. Seattle and San Francisco.
Believe That Bill Introduced at
Washington Will Prevent the
Use of False Labels.

Special " Dispatch to . The CalL
Taking heart at 'the rapid success qf
the San Francisco grocers, Spokane re
tailers launched the Inland Cracker and
Candy Company, and at the present time
are offering merchants all over the coun
try goods at a lower figure than the trust.
Now Tacoma comes to the front with
an appeal to the retail grocers to follow
in the steps of San Francisco and Spo
kane and break the trust. Seattle has a
small plant operated outside of the com
bine, and a proposition has been made to
establish a similar concern In Portland.
With these facts confronting the compa
n!es which have controlled the trade for
years. It is likely that a war of prices
will be instituted in a few days to compel
the outsiders to come into the fold.
"How eoon war will break out I do not
know," said the manager of the Pacific
Coast Biscuit Company to-day. "One
thing is sure â I will not stand idly by and
see the business ruined by a lot of small
fry who merely want us to buy them out.
Jset as soon as we find that the action of
these small concerns is injurious we will
meet them. So far as the Mutual of San
Francisco is concerned, it is a small fac
tory started by the retail grocers. We
have had propositions to buy them out,
but we have quit buying those kind of
plants." Â¦ â¢
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 11â War against
the cracker trust has been declared, and
some of thÂ« concerns connected with the
Â©omblnatlon arÂ» considering thÂ« question
of slashing prices.
Various retail grocers' associations are
responsible for the turmoil. For a long
tlmÂ» too cracker trust has had absolute
control of the trade on the Pacific Coast,
and included eight concerns. Schedules
of prices were signed by every firm In
tha business. Retailers claim that prices
at once Jumped from 15 to 0 per cent.
Retail grocers in Ban Francisco orga
nized the Mutual Cracker and Biscuit
Company. A plant was established and
tho products of the concern placed upon
the market at rates varying from 10 to 40
per cent below the figures quoted by the
combine. The business increased until
the Mutual had the temerity to enter the
Oregon field and cut prices up to the
threshold of the trust's factories.

NOTHING AHEAD
BUT VICTORY
__ j â
overtrained as teams have
been in the past. Only one
of our men â Hudson â is
injured, and he may be able
to play through the game.
I think the team is better
this year than last, all the
talk to the contrary notwith
standing. There was a
slump early in the season,,
but that happens on the best
regulated teams. Veteran
teams especially are given to
carelessness at times. We
have had hard work devel
oping our backs, because
they are not veterans. Mini
is the only man playing in
his old position. I think we
will si. jrise the people who
have been saying Stanford
has the swiftest backs. I
can see nothing else but vic
tory ahead of us." â Captain
Overall of University of
California, in an interview.
* V I \ HE team is about as
JL near perfect as the
coaches could get it. The
men are in the best physical
condition. They are not
\ X T E are not confi-
V V dent by any
means, for there are no
grounds for confidence, but
we are determined. I don't
think Berkeley has it on us
much, and if the men put up
the best game^they have in
them I shall be satisfied. I
am relying on fast, well-exe
cuted team work to score
against California. We will
play straight football and
rely on that to make our
gains. The players have it in
them to beat Berkeley and I
expect every man to play the
game of his life. The team
is united, has had good back
ing from the rooters and will
have! it during the game. . I
don't think weather condi
tions will make any difference
in the comparative showing
of the teams. They will be
as fair for one side as for
the other. A wet day will
favor neither." â Captain
Bansbach of Stanford Uni
versity, in an interview.
"STANFORD IS
DETERMINED,"
SAYS BANSBACH
*Cy- THINK we have just
J[ about an even break
for the intercollegiate game,
and that is as far . as I can
prophesy. We have no more
show to win this game than
,we had to win the freshman
match, and you know what
that means. The team has
worked hard and every man
on it is in good condition.
They have not been over
worked, and yet they have
done everything asked of
them. We shall -play
straight, hard football from
the beginning to the end of
the game, and ,if that can
not win it is not in the
eleven to do it, that's all.
Berkeley has an advantage
in the line that will be hard
to overcome. They have it
on us in weight about sev
enty pounds in their three
center men." â Coach Lana
gan of Stanford University,
in an interview.
COACH LANAGAN
SAYS TEAM HAS
AN EVEN BREAK
"/^ALIF.ORNIA is
\^ putting a better
team in the field than it did
last year. The men have
trained faithfully and con
scientiously. It is stronger
on the defensive than it is on
tile offensive, but that does
not mean the offense is
weak. Our backs, I think,
are every bit as fast as the
Stanford backs. Weller is
the best man Stanford has
behind the line, and he can
not play the whole game.
We have backs who will
be able to make ground
through S.tanford steadily.
I am afraid of trick plays,
though our men were taught
a lesson in the Nevada
game. If the field is heavy
it will make the playing
slower and will reduce the
scoring, evening up the
chances of the teams. I have
the greatest confidence in
the ability of our men to
play a good, machine-like
game."â Coach Whipple of
University of California, in
an interview.

now owned by Louis Rosenfeld, is hard
at work in his home at Alameda on a
floop, which will, no doubt, turn out an
able boat. John J. Sherry, another well
known member of the California Yacht
Club, has a model for a boat forty-five
feet long over all and with a length on
the water line of twenty-five feet. He
is putting the frames together, at his

will be enormous, and lucky is the man
who can purchase a seat this morning.
The field will be slippery, and. worst of

He asserted last night that a storm had
struck the coast in the north and was

was a possibility the moisture would get

he added ' that people must not expect
such good fortune.
If it rains the game will be slow and
every play will be uncertain. The men
will slip and flounder, and field goals will
be almost impossible. It will be hard for
the center and the quarter to make ac
curate passes, and harder yet >i. for '. the

runs will be barred. The play will neces
sarily consist of line plunges, with pos
sibly a few tricks. :
However, there is a chance the weather
will be clear, in the afternoon. The field
is sandy, and if Â¦> it does ; not rain this
morning an attempt will be made to dry
it with > sawdust. Â¦-. Owing to .the recent
rains the* gridiron cannot be put into the

tions may, be.

FOOTBALL. ELEVENS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY AS THEY WILL
FACE ONE ANOTHER THIS AFTERNOON : ON RICHMOND , FIELD IN THEIR ANNUAL GAME. THE
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE COLLEGE ATHLETES ARE BY BOYE.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 13.
Everything is In readiness for the
football contest of the year with
California. The men are trained to the
hour. They are la superb physical con
dition and capable of playing as hard and
as fast a same of football as conscien
tious, thorough coaching and a strict ob
servance of training rules can make them.
Whether the cardinal eleven wins or loses
In to-morrow's contest, the players have
the united support of a body of loyal root,
ers, who will leave the field knowing
Stanford has played Us best.
The spirit that pervades the Stanford
campus .to-night Is not one of over
confidence, or even - confidence, but a
dogged determination to win Is every
where in evidence. It is admitted the
chances are favorable to California, but
they were more so in the freshman con
test, when one presumptuous critic said
California was bound to win 20 to 0, and
yet the Berkeley youngsters were clearly
outclassed. The Stanford freshman eleven
had the "Lanagan spirit," which is but
another name for the true Stanford spirit,
and the rooters feel sure the head coach
has thoroughly instilled this spirit into
the varsity eleven.
The one thing that appears to be most
disadvantageous for the Stanford varsity
is the disproportionate weight of the cen
ter trios on the two elevens. California's
three center men will outweigh Stanford's
middle men at least seventy poundsâ a
large handicap for the lighter men to
overcome. Berkeley's center trio will av
erage over 200 pounds to the man, stripped
weight, making Stanford's 173-pound cen
ter men look like midgets. It does not
follow, however, that weight cannot be
overcome. The Stanford linemen have
been' trained for speed, and the coaches
depend on this quality to overcome the
advantage of weight. .
Hauverman, center; Thompson, left
guard; Sprott, left tackle, and Clark.. left
end, are all varsity veterans and have
proved their worth In Intercollegiate con
tests. Jacobs, right guard; Shields, right
tackle, and Smith, right end, have won
their positions this season as the result
of a hard and determined fight among a
large number of candidates. Although
none of these men are of the average ot
weight as varsity, linemen go, neverthe
less they have played In varsity form dur
ing the preliminary games this season,
and much is expected of them to-morrow.
Behind the line Captain Bansbacb at
quarter Is a veteran of four seasons. Be
sides using good generalship, the stocky
little quarter Is a strong man at backing
up the line and running interference.
"Savage" Dole, left half. Is the only vet
eran in the back field trio. He can be de
pended upon to play the most consistent
game of the eleven men who will repre
sent the cardinal. Chalmers, right half,
is a freshman, having entered Stanford
this fall from Portland. His college stand,
ing was not arranged in time to permit
his playing on the freshman eleven, but
his work during the season has justified
the coaches in placing him on the varsity.
"Jim" Weller, fullback, played his first
football as candidate for .the freshman!?
eleven this fall, but his work has been
so | brilliant that already he is rated as
one of the best fullbacks Stanford : ha3
ever produced. The cardinal backfleki
quartet will outweigh their opponents an
average of nearly five pounds to the man.
This additional weight rests largely with
the cardinal fullback, who weighs fifteen
pounds more than his opponent.
Trainer "Dad" Moulton is well satisfied
with the condition of the players. He
said to-night: "The team is in perfect
condition; there has never been a team
on the coast in better condition nor, one
better coached than the Stanford; eleven
has been this year."

Co ntinued on Page 10, Column 4,
FOR the next three months the
principal topic of the baseball fans
and the magnates will be about
players who are to perform on the Pacific
Coast next season. The present season is
as good as ended and every one who fol
lows the game of baseball is naturally
interested in the outlook for next year.
As usual, the magnates are all orating
about what swell ball teams they will
control, but this kind of a talk Is not al
ways taken with seriousness by the fans,
for is it not repeated year after year, and
how often do the gentlemen who do the
talking make good?
Mr. Morley seems the leader in signing
'em up for the coming campaign. Al
ready he has a pretty fair sort of a ball
team corraled. If he is successful in en-
CALIFORNIA is, apparently, the
Mecca of the prinicpal coursJng
men of the Middle West just now,
as many greyhounds are being sent on to
compete for the valuable stakes to be de
cided h*re this' winter.
Wilson & Allen of Kansas have sent
threeâ Barefoot Boy, Troublesome and
Apple Blossomâ which are already here.
The firm will also send on Tours Truly,
runner-up to Rubber Ankles in the Wa
terloo; Path5nder, winner of the Fu
turity; Advertiser, Crank, Corkscrew and
Bill Dugan. Advertiser was conceded the
fastest puppy in the Futurity, but he be
came eick after winning three courses.
Cecil Lyon of Texas Is sending twelve
greyhounds in charge of Peter Olnio.
Blake & Smith of Butte will send North-
cheered on by thousands of
college enthusiasts, the thoroughbred,
too, has his admirers, and another vast
crowd promises to pay tribute, rain or
shine, to the opening of the racing sea
son at Oakland track.
*It is no exaggeration to say that there
are more" high-class horses here and a
greater number of turfmen, riders and
bookmakers than ever visited California
before. Although may not all be
present at the track across the bay this
afternoon, there are plungers headed out
this way who bet thousands with the
sang-froid that a ferry-ticket seller passes
out 'your change. Not that plungers are
a necessity to good and clear sport, but
it demonstrates that the quality of rac
ing furnished here Is attracting the at
tention of the world.

ALTHOUGH many members of the
South End, Ariel and Dolphin
rowing clubs on this side of the
bay and of the Alameda Boating Club
on Oakland Creek have gone out for rec
reation, and practice in barges and skiffs
during the past few months, there has
been no regatta nor organized event to
attract the attention of the oarsmen.
At a meeting on Monday night in the
headquarters of the Pacific Association of
the Amateur Athletic Union in the Emma
Spreckels building arrangements were
made for a race that will excite great in
terest among the rowing men of San
Francisco Bay and the Pacific Coast. In
deed, years have passed by since a cham
pionship rowing event of equally wide
spread interest has occurred on the
waters adjacent to this city.
On January 3, 1904, A. "W. Pape of the
Olympic Athletic Club and the Dol
phin Boating Club, for several years
the champion single shell sculler of the
Pacific Coast, and F. W. Ayers of the
Alameda Boating Club, the Pacific Coast
champion in the outrigged skiff, will race
on Lake Merrltt, Oakland. The race will
be started at 9:30 1 in the morning and will
be over the regular championship course,
distance one and a half miles, with a
turn. Both contestants were present at
the meeting at which the arrangements
for the contest were made, W. B. Hinch
man . representing â¢ the Alameda Boating
Club and W. A. Remensperger being the
representative of the Dolphin Boating
Club. The prize will be a trophy
value $35â the most valuable permitted by
the rules of the Amateur Athletic Union.
-The following officials have been select.
fd: John J. Gleason of the Olympic Ath
letic Club, referee; Robert Me Arthur of
the South End Rowing Club, starter; J.
S. Earls of the Dolphin Boating Club, B.
G. Lyons of the Alameda Boating Club
and T.< J. Fitxpa trick of the South End
Rowing* Club, Judges at the turn; W. A.

Ariel Rowing Club. Judges at the finish;
Sidney Cavill - of thÂ« Olympic Club.
Charles H. Smith of the Alameda Boating

(Editor Health Culture Magazine. New Tork.)
Of all the wonders of cell life perhaps
the most striking Is the immense variety
of the cells, which may be divided into
four classesâ epithelial cells, connective
tlasue cells, muscle cells and nerve cells.
Of these the most numerous are the epi
thelial cells, which are of the greatest
possible variety in form and function., In
the skin and the lining surfaces of certain
organs, such as the mouth and throat,
they form a protective covering. Upon
the surfaces of the throat and bronchial
tubes we find, epithelial cells s provided
with tiny arms, or cilia, as they are
called. These cilia move incessantly back
and forth with a peculiar motion, like the
stroke of a swimmer's armsâ a short,
quick stroke toward the mouth, then a
Blow stroke backward. The object of this
movement Is to propel toward the mouth,
Â¦where they may be ejected, the dead cells,
particles of Inhaled dust and other mat
ters which adhere to the surface; of the
throat and bronchial tubes. These tiny
cells, so small that it would take many
thousands of them placed side by side to
reach one Inch, know their duty so well
that not one ever makes a false stroke
always a Quick push stroke toward the
mouth and a slow withdrawal. Were the
stroke to be reversed, were the â¢ mucous
and foreign matter adhering to the sur
face to be propelled backward into the
lungs, the result would be â¢ serious de
rangement of the general functions, if not
death. But the wise little cells know their
duty.

/.Thepast generations thaO felt] the .whblesorne discipline of
mamma's slipper ; when youthful mischief got the better of
youthful Â¦discretion were pretty good* generations 1 of people.
CANDIDATE HEARST lays the eggs of an idea
under every chip. When these are developed the
people will have a complete' ground plan and front
elevation of his opinions on sociology, government," morals;
manners and everything except .why, an ox sweats through
his nose and the nose of a dog is cold.
The latest is the elaborate statement of his idea about the
discipline of children. His feelings are : hurt by the occa
sional correction of unruly youngsters by their mammas in
public. If a mischievous little : one gets so full of ginger
that it insists on wiping its muddy shoes on the immaculate
skirts of a strange lady and refuses to desist until it becomes
r.ecessary for the mamma to slap its hands Mr. Hearst ad
vises that any one who sees this maternal atrocity shall walk
over and, hit the offending mamma a sounding thwack on
the head or a "right hander on the solar plexus, remarking
by way of explanation, "How do you like it yourself?" In
some cases he would vary the treatment by strangers calling
the mother "a' brute." â¢
The , proof ' of the string, is in chewing the pudding, or
words to that effect. A reformer should have the courage of
his convictions, and we beg to suggest that Candidate Hearst
try it on. The nextjtime he sees a mother correct an unruly
child. when; moral suasion has failed let him go up and^box
the offending mother's ears, or give her a punch "in, the cor
set, or call. her a brute. , We are of the opinion that as soon
as her husband or other male protector can identify him the
candidate will have an opportunity, to acquire s ecchymosed
optics and maybe a broken nose, 1 if not the sufferer by in
juries still more serious. â¢ - \ .
. No one advocates the whipping of children and the cases
of punishment in public or private are so rare that they rather
provetheruietobeabstention from that method of correc
tion: V, But Mr. Hearst sees the rule to be the other way. and
his' desire to mind everybody's business induces him ; to i ad
vertise American "motherhood .as a system of unfeeling
tyranny, requiringas; a remedy public assault upon
mothers in" street fears and other public p laces.'

PRESIDENTIAL IDEAS.
It is as hard to account for the popu
larity of certain tunes as It Is for the
popularity of certain books. One time it
was "McGinty" whose adventures at the
bottom of the sea took possession of the
whistling and organ-grinding world; later
it was "Mr. Dooley"; now It is "Hiawa
tha," which . is described as r "the mad
melody that will not stop." "Hiawatha"
has not yet crossed the ocean; "Mr. Doo
ley" has. During the summer just past
I spent a few weeks in North Wales.
While lying one day in. the heather at
the top of a mountain 1000 feet above
the village of Penmaenmawr, with noth
ing but the occasional note of a bird to
break the silence, up from the village
below came the sound of a hand organ,
and the strains of "Mr. Dooley" were
wafted to the mountain. top. . "Is there no
escape from this, all-pervading "tune?" I
thought, as I wandered farther back up
the mountain to get rid of it, but all the
way I stepped in time to the music that
I thought I had left behind me in New
York. Later In the season I crossed over
to Paris. One evening I was driving back
of the open-air; theaters that line the
Champs Ely,sees. Stopping the carriage
for a moment I said to the friend who
was with me: "Walt a minute and you
will hear a characteristic . French song"
I had scarcely spoken the words when
"Meester Doolee" floated out over the
lanterns and "fairy lights" and above the
noise of the popping corks.â The Lounger

THE spite shown against Americans in Bogota by ston
ing their houses and shutting them indoors is not dis
quieting, for it is nothing new. The opponents of the
administration will point to it as caused solely by the Pan
ama affair. 'But it is simply a fresh expression of the con
tempt for Americans and their" rights that has been the rule
for years in most of the Latin-American states.
Our citizens have \been 'robbed by Salvador and ordered
to leave. or stay and be, killed. They'have been imprisoned
in Honduras, while their property was being stolen, and then
released without trial and ordered out of the country without
explanation. American gentlemen have been attacked on the
streets of Central American capitals, insulted in clubs, de
spoiied and ] humiliated,'; and our Government has ; not ex
tended its protection because tKese outrages were committed
by "our w eak sister republics."- .. While we have Â¦'Â¦ protected
the integrity of their, te-ritory and sovereignty against Eu^
rope by. the Monroe doctrine the most unpopular and unsafe
man down there has always been the American. It; is time
to- change this. Once let^ it be understood that injury or
denial Â¦ of justice to an American will be', swiftly and sternly
punished and there will be a change. If the Panama' matter
be the means of such a change of policy it will be vindicated.
.Our people must \ be instructed in the nature and customs
of those Governments. "'They have excellent republican con
stitutions, which are, as much regarded as*tea_ chest labefs.
With few exceptions the administration is entirely autocratic.

COLOMBIAN RAGE.
In the scandalous into the charges that local
police officers thrive upon the bribery of saloon-keepers
nothing, strangely enough, has been said to indicate that
our Market-street dives pay dishonest, money to continue
their iniquities in spite of the protests of decency. Is it pos
sible that these dens enjoy protection more powerful than
that of ordinary policemen?
A New York widow, unduly impressed by the value of
money, died in squalor the other day and left five hundred
thousand dollars to two daughters. The young ladies will
probably correct the mistake of their parent and live justly
observant of the rights of society to share in a judicious
circulation^ of cash.
Old Jokes the Best.
"It must be very discouraging to the
menjwho^wrlte^ comedy, and especially to
the men "who 'write the librettos of the
musical comedies, to realize that the old
jokes are the ones that invariably get
the laugh," said the 'veteran theater
goer. "I have frequently observed this
state of affairs. The original humor that
the author places in the mouths of his
characters never seems to appeal to an
audience like the moss-grown Jests that
are evidently interpolated. In fact, the
older ar Joke is, the more welcome it
seems to be. I suppose it's on the prin
ciple that old friends are best. I at
tended a performance the other events
that was full of , laughs, and most cf
the lines were original; but the thing
that struck the audience as being tha
funniest bit In the show was when the
principal comedian drinks champagne for
the first time, makes- a grimace and says
â¢It feels Just like your foot was asleep.'
Then the people howled and nearly fell
out of their seats. And yet I'll venture to
say the joke, if you can call it a Joke

Some time before the year 1800 there ex

many , societies named Tammany, after

established May 12, .1789. Its object in
the beginning was wholly in the interest

The number of persons at t the noon meal
in Chicago's 1200 restaurants, 300 hotels
and numerous saloons with cafe accom
modations may be safely estimated at
300,000. or an average of 100 at each. This
is probably an underestimate. The Audi
torium serves on the average 2000 meals
a day.-yand in times of rush as high as
35(w a day (allowing one meal for each
person); and some of the. big restaurants
have from 500 to 1000 patrons at noon.
The cost of a meal varies from 5 cents tc
?5, but, by striking an average of 20 cents
a total of $40,000 is obtained as the amount
spent daily by the 200,000 downtown work
ers. This sum is considerably increased,
perhaps to J100.000, if we include what is
paid for breakfast and supper by persons
who regularly get those meals at hotels
and restaurants. This makes a yearly ex
penditure of {36,000,000 by patrons of hotels
and restaurants. It is hard to ascertain
the cost of living in families, at best no
more than a rough calculation Is possible.
The daily expenditure for provisions for
a family of five Is probably as much as
$1 on the average, of 20 cents a head
making a total of $400,000 a day for the
2,000,000 who regularly get two or three
meals at home. Here is a grand total of
$180,000,000 for feeding Chicago's. 2,200,000
people one year. The Item for meat alone
is $36,000,000, or $100,000 a day (for 1,000,000
pounds at 10 cents a pound). The item for
bread (and its equivalent In rolls, dough
nuts, cookies, etc) is $18,000,000, or $50 000
a day (for 1,000,000 loaves at 5 cents each).
As the number of persons accustomed to
luxurious living is continually increasing
the yearly outlay for the. city's food
may be as much as $200,000,000, or about $90
per capita.â The World To-Day.

r "Well, sir, the ,' way General Shafter
came down that slope was something to
remember. Finally he tore up to â¢ the
wagon and we hauled him in over the
tailboard. Then' one of the men shot the
bear. Â¦
"When Shafter had got his breath
some he turned to Miles and said: 'Miles,
I don't think much of your new carbines
out here. They, would not be of much
good in a forced retreat.' And he broke
the gun at the, breech and showed Miles
the empty shell, which had lodged In the
chamber."
After we had been on the road some
hours we spofted an old she one and her
cubs off on a little level flat some rods
% from the road. We let the general take
a shot at the bear, but he missed arid
she went off into the bushes. Nothing
would do but that Shafter must go af
ter her, so he started and the rest of us
staid In the wagon so that he could have
all the sport of bringing her down. Well,
Shafter disappeared in the bushes and
there was no noise for a minute, and then
we heard a shot. We were Just saying
that the general must have made his kill
when we heard a yell, and here comes
Shafter. "
Â¦ ''He came out of those bushes on the
jump, waving his gun and going over the
high places like a rabbit. You know that
must have been. going some for General
Shafter. Behind him about a hundred
paces was the she bear with her back
humped up and slapping at her sides as
she ran. The general was coming down
hill toward us and was right in line with
the bear, so we could not take a shot at
her. without being in danger of hitting
Shafter.
"Well, sir," began "Mitch," "I have
hunted bears several times myself and I
have seen others hunt them, but I will
never forget the time that General Shat
ter went after big game. I was with
Miles then, up In the Yellowstone coun
try, and Shatter came through the post
on a trip north. Shafter said he wanted
to get some, bear hunting and so

THE staid old Westminster Review of London has so
far relaxed its austere dTgnity" as- to dwell, at/some
length upon that remarkable freak, the American col
lege yell. As if it were dissecting a. new species'of star fish
the Review carefully analyzes the component parts of the
yell, segregates it into its elements and even goes so far as
to reproduceâ much to the evident discomfiture of the lino
type manâ several "college cheers" picked at random from
the rare assortment offered from the nine hundred and ninety
nine American institutions of culture. "Friends of religious
education," says the Review, "will sigh to learn that the
simpler 'cheers'- in the various cases enumerated are those of
non-sectarian institutions, while the more elongated and
cacaphonous are Baptist . and Methodist Episcopal respect
ively."
The specialist on the Review has done a great work, has
made a contribution to contemporary phonetics which
should live through the ages and find an honored place in
the British Museum so that coming generations may read
and have understanding. For what American writer, living
here in the midst of these fearful and wonderful phenomena
of latter day humanities, would dare to approach a task so
fraught with live interest but imposing such unlimited re
search in these bleak November days; when the chrysanthe T
mum blossoms and the football gear transforms our young
men into semblances of Normandy truck horses â days when
the dog crawls under the front porch and the college yawp
is in the air? * - /
The expert phonologist who seeks the derivation and the
historical usage of the college yell finds his path beset with
difficulties. At first blush it would seem to be of primitive
Indian, origin on account of the gutturals and the general
bloodthirsty import of its tenor." But the records of the
early pioneers tell us that the Indian war cry had a singular
sameness and d/finiteness of expression to it in^vhich the col
lege cry is lacking. ' Nor can it be conjectured that the slo
gan is compiled. as the result of the imitative instinct of
those residing in the vicinity of a nail foundry, for again
the ""diversified rhyme scheme .prohibits this theory. "Eat
'em up â chop 'em upâ give 'em the axâ Berkeley"; the crux
remains one of the seven days' marvels of modern culture.

Judges of the Superior bench, solid bankers, "ministers of

THE AMERICAN COLLEGE SLOGAN.
A startling fact connected with these
great lava flows is that they are so re
cent. Professor Miller of the United
States geological survey demonstrates
that near Lassen Peak, in Northern Cal
ifornia, vast eruptions of volcanic ash
and basaltic lava, covering many square
miles, have occurred in less than 200
years. Professor I. C. Russell, also of
the United States geological survey,
thinks that still larger volcanic outflows
occurred in Idaho within that short per
iod of time. Indeed, the geysers and boll
ing mud springs of Yellowstone Park
would eeem to be breathing holes of these
deep Internal fires which are still in ac
tion. An area in New Zealand, filled with
geysers similar to those In Yellowstone
Park, blew up a few years ago and dev
astated that whole region. Geologists
would not bÂ« surprised if similar explo
sions should take place anywhere in the
volcanic region west of the Rocky Moun
tains.
But the most remarkable outflowings of
lava In all the world are to be found in
North America west of the Rocky Moun
tains. In the Snake River Valley in Ida
ho about 12,000 square miles consist of
fresh iava plains through which the river
has in places cut a gorge 800 feet deep
through alternate beds of volcanic ash
and basaltic lava. The Shoshone Falls
have dissected this plain in a most inter
esting manner. For hundreds of miles
the river flows between perpendicular
walls of lava hundreds of feet in thick
ness, and at last plunges down 200 feet or
more and flows onward between walls of
lava 800 feet in height. SUll vaster areas
in Northern California, Oregon, Washing
ton and British Columbia are covered
with lava, in many cases thousands of
feet thick. In all more than 100,000 square
miles are thus covered west of the Rocky
Mountains.
Where the surrounding rock has been
cracked and lava has filled the seam this
is called a "dike." and the material filling
it "trap." In many cases of old rocks
the softer parts have since been worn
away and the dike remains as a project
ing ridge or mountain. The Palisades
above New York City. Mounts Tom and
Holyoke in Massachusetts, East and
West mountains at New Haven, Conn.,
and many similar prominences on the
esatern fringe of the Allegheny Moun
tains are trap-dikes. So also are the cel
ebrated Fingal's Cave and the Giant's
Causeway in Ireland.
The evidence of ancient volcanic action
is found in all the older rocks, and in
many that are of recent origin. Many
islands in the ocean are nothing but piles
of volcanic material thrown up from cra
ters in the bottom of the sea. The Azores,
the Canaries, St. Helena and many other
islands have been built up by volcanic
action from great depths. In 1S11 the cra
ter of a volcano suddenly emerged from
the sea near the Azores and ejected vast
quantities of lava, stones and cinders,
but the waves have since washed it all
away.
BT GEORGES FREDERICK WRIGHT. A.
M-. LL. D.
(Author of "Man and the Glacial Period." etc.)
The distribution of volcanoes is well
worthy of attention, "iv**:.
The Pacific Ocean 1b almost complete
ly surrounded by them. Volcanic peaks
rise as sentinels all along the mountain
chain running from Patagonia to Alaska,
and thence around through Kamchatka,
down the Asiatic coast to the Malay
archipelago. Nearly all the islands also
of the Pacific Ocean either contain ac
tive volcanoes or are of volcanic origin,
while in the interior of the continents
there ere few.
From this wide and peculiar distribu
tion of volcanoes it Is inferred that their
cause is very deep seated and that it is in
some way connected with the sea. Their
activity is doubtless often due to the wa
ter which leaks through the solid rocks,
arid upon reaching the heated mass is
turned into steam and thus an eruption
may be compared to the explosion of a
boiler. Great volumes of steam often is
sue from their craters, and in some cases
floods of water are vomited forth, though
sometimes such floods are produced by
the sudden melting of snow, upon the
sides of the volcano.

We state only a fact in human history, but not with the
remotest expectation that it is imminent in this country. We
believe that the law-abiding American spirit : in the labor
unions will see clearly that moral victories should be. won by
moral means and that their results are permanent only when
so won. If the country were now furnished the spectacle of a
Chicago strike, involving three or four thousand men and the
welfare of about twenty thousand dependents upon them,
peacefully begun and carried on to a victory, the benefit to
union labor would be incalculable.
The peril to human life in Chicago now restrains people
from riding on the street cars.. Crews and passengers have
been assaulted, incurable wounds have been inflicted, distress
has been caused to hundreds. Does not any one see that the
people in Chicago, the public, the third party to the. contro
versy, is forbidden to demonstrate its sympathy with, the
cause of labor, because it quits the street cars under duress
and does not use them through fear? Withdraw all violence,
make a moral appeal to the third party, the public, and per
mit the people to give the moral answer by avoiding the cars
voluntarily, accepting inconvenience and loss as an ex
pression of sentiment,' and union labor would win a victory
transcending all that has ever been gained by violence, homi
cide and boycott combined.
To do this would be. American. It would be in line with
the spirit of our political institutions. It would leave the
law supreme over the rights of all. The experiment if ever
tried at all by union labor must be tried in a community like
Chicago. It must be in the midst of a population passionate,
eager and busy. If under such circumstances the moral ap
peal succeed the cause- of union labor is established. But if
the violent processes continue and,the third party, th'e people,
restrained by fear, submit sullenly to loss and inconvenience,
nothing is settled except the power.of a physical combination
to defy the law and substitute itself for government for the
time being. We insist that the experiment of a peaceful
strike of great magnitude is worth trying.
This incident and the current events in Chicago are in their
essence putting popular institutions on trial. Under our
system the law is the sole protection of human rights. s What
ever wrongs men suffer have their remedy in the law. .If
that remedy be withdrawn and the protection of the law fail,
then we have no Government at all. When that is estab
lished who will suffer? When the law is no longer sufficient
to protect personal and property rights, then only the strong
hand can get and keep. Where that condition has appeared
among men heretofore the combination of strong hands
has built a substitute for popular government, overthrown by
refusal to be mindful of the law. Under such a substitute the
weak, who in combination created the necessity, have been
the sufferers.
IN a great city like Chicago, with the majority of its peo
ple of alien birth, the preservation of public- order and
protection in the : peaceful enjoyment of the rights of
person and property become matters of national importance^
It is a field in which union labor has a peculiar opportunity"
to prove that all of its processes and the accomplishment of
a.11 of its great purposes are consistent with complete ; obe
dience to the law of the land.
The claims of union labor are moral claims. 'Their pur
pose is -to effect a proper balance in hours and. wages that
shall align with the higher standards of American life, which
exceed the standards of other countries. \\ As these are moral
claims their peaceful accomplishment is a moral victory. -But
is an advantage secured by violence, by the use of force, the
destruction of life and property, a moral victory? Â¦[ This ques
tion will have to be soberly considered by the ; leaders' of
union labor.
Some of them made a mistake in the meeting of the Ameri
can'Federation in Boston by assailing President Roosevelt.
No one has answered his statement of the law, which forbids
that he discriminate between classes in Government employ
ment. The member at Boston who said that' every, man in
the convention under the same circumstances would have
done just as the Prcsident^did made a wholesome. statement,
for it meant that every one of them would'have been mindful
of his oath to enforce the law without discrimination. No
one contradicted it. No one denied that he would have acted
as the President acted. Therefore it is fair to assume that if
they pass condemnatory resolutions they will be censuring
the President for doing what they admit they would have
done themselves. k s ,Â» :

They learned a proper respect for the rights of others and
had notions of morality, that restrained them from shameless

it was the slipper : or not men and women were reared to

is rare and is'to be avoided as long as it can be without
harming the child by teaching it irresponsibility for its acts,
there are other things :'showni in-public and flaunted before

There* is a deal of philosophy In what
the Mining and Scientific Press says
about the gold miners, as follows: !
Of all the industries affected by the pretsent
condition of the industrial world minim; feels
it most heavily, particularly iron. Copper and
coal mining:. Gold mining, however, continues
in iu even course almost unaffected by either
the prosperity or the reverses of the country.
If Industrial conditions generally are sluggish
and times are hard the grold miner profits by
It. If he Is already established in business
he can then buy machinery and supplies at a
comparatively low figure. If, however, he
desires to secure money to equip and develop
a new enterprise he usually finds difficulty In
raisins the necessary funds. When the coun
try Is prosperous, as It has been since the re
cent Spanish war, all supplies are high, and
machinery, particularly, is much more expen
elve than a few years aÂ«x>. So heavy have
been the demands for structural Iron and stoel
that the iron mines have until lately scarcely
been able to keep ud with the constantly in
creasing demand. In view of thin condition
much old machinery has been remodeled into
new or has been melted In the furnaces to
supply material for constructing: newÂ» machin
ery designed on modern lines. Gold always
finds a. ready market at a uniform price, and
no matter what the condition of the times
the cold miner feels secure.
A LARGE EXHIBIT.
a half from Hawkins school houso and 32 miles
east of FreÂ»no City. The material Is pale
olive preen, translucent, with darker spots
in a paler mass. It breaks with an uneven
fracture, slightly epllntery and partly crys
talline, and hence much resembles tho Sieki
you County material. The other locality Is
apparently not very distant from the last
mentioned. It is said to be In Tulare County,
near the town of Selma, which, though in
Fresno County, Is not far from the Tulare
line. Here the mineral Is of even a richer
color, at times resembling the tint of apple
preen chrysoprase, for which It waÂ« at first
mistaken.

It Is not really, indeed, a new mineral spe
cies, but a compact,' massive variety of vesu
vianlte (idocrase). It is a hard and hand
some stone, varying from olive to almost grass
green and taking a fine polish. The outcrop
is along 200 feet en a hillside, about 100 feet
above a creek. Large mafe*B have fallen into
the bed cf the creek. Some of the fallen
pieces arc as large as five feet square and two
Uft thick, of excellent quality for polishing
and of. varying shades from light- to dark
green. The associated rock ' Js precious ser
pentine. It was at first supposed to be jade,
but analysis proves It to be vesuvlanite. It
admits of as handsome a polish as jade. .The
mineral exists in large. quantities.
What appears to be the same mineral has
recently been announced from two other locali
ties quite remote from the first. One of these
was reported by that indefatigable prospector,
M. Bravertnan, of Vlsalla, as existing in
Burro Valley, in Fresno County, a mile and
The Mount Hope group of mines, near
Grizzly Flat, El Dorado County, Is re

r.ame of Californite. This Is a new orndC
mental etone that was discovered In this
State. Kunz reports that It promises well
as an addition to the Increasing list of
semi-precious or ornamental stones .found
in the United States. The mineral was
discovered on the South Fork of Indian
Creek, twelve miles from Happy Camp
and ninety miles from Yreka, Slekiyou
County. The report follows:

Secretary Benjamin says that between
500 and 600 delegates are expected to at
tend the convention and that It will be
one of the most Interesting and important
ever held by the Miners* Association. The
reports of the president and secretary of
the association will also show, so the sec
retary says, that quiet and vigorous work
of the officers and committeemen of the
Miners' Association has saved the oil
lands of California and has brought in
hundreds of thousands of dollars of East

He subsequently took up the practice
of his profession In this city and won an
enviable name at the local bar. Later he
went to Sacramento and stands in the
forefront of the bar of that city. He Is
a deep student of criminology and his ex
perience will stand him In good stead in
dealing with the lawless element within
the walls of Folsom prison.
Robert M. Fitzgerald, president of the
board, found It was imperative to hold
the meeting yesterday, as It was the only
Warden cf Folsom prison. Yell
will not be elected until next Wednesday,
when the board will meet at Folsom
prison.
TIjo new Warden is one of the best
known Democrats in the State. At pres
ent he holds the position of Assistant
District Attorney of Sacramento County.
He was born in Fayetteville, Ark. After
the war he came to this State and took
up his residence in Ukiah, Mendoclno
County. He practiced law there and was
elected District Attorney. He was also
the county's representative in the State
Senate and during- the two terms spent at
Sacramento he did a great deal of good
for his section. It was due to his efforts
that the Jnsane Asylum was established
at Uklah.
TUB Board of Prison Directors at
Its meeting et San Quentin yes
terday selected Archibald Yell to
succeed Thomas Wilkinson us
Owing to the'press of business the vari
ous bills that were to be audited yester
day were laid over "until to-day, when
the board will meet In the office of Robert
M. Fitzgerald and look over the accounts.
After luncheon the board took up the
discussion of appointing a successor to
Warden Wilkinson. The names of ex-Sher
iff J. SL Stanley of Mendoclno, Thomas
J. Fallen of San Rafael, U. S. Gregory of
Amador and ex-Supervisor Handley of
Lob Angeles were considered, In conjunc
tion with Archibald Yell of Sacramento.
After a prolonged discussion the board
unanimously selected Yell and he will bÂ©
elected as stated. The board adjourned
at 3 o'clock.
Wilcox was prominent in Santa Clara
County, and ever since his Incarceration
In San Quentln every possible effort has
been made to get him out. At San Quen
tin he waa the most prominent and trust
ed Inmate there. He had been recom
mended several times to various Gover
nors for pardon, but without success, un
til Governor Pardee agreed on his parole
and eventually it is presumed will sign
his pardon. Several times Wilcox has
prevented dangerous riots and frustrated
p'.ans of escape. For such valuable ser
vices he was rewarded. He left for San
Jose to-night.
The applications for parole made by
life-termers Gllkey and Richards were de
nied, i
day his fellow members could be present.
Senator R. T. Devlin came down from
Sacramento to attend the meeting, Sena
tor C. N. Felton, James H. Wilkina and
Don Ray were also present.
The board held ao executive session in
the morning, when applications for pa
role were taken up and two of them
granted. The fortunate petitioners are
William Stanton, who was serving twen
ty-five years for murder in this second de
gree committed at Vallejo, and Charles
B. Wllcox sentenced for life for killing

Grand Jury Meeting.
The Grand Jury met yesterday, but
transacted no official business beyond dis
cussing in an informal way the shortage
in the probate department. The Grand
Jury Is now awaiting the report of the
experts on the matter.
Th<? twelfth annual convention of ths
Calif ::;ia MJaenf Association will be j
cpe.ifd on Monday next in Stcmwcy Hsll
at Â£3 Sutler street. The sessions will
c.^'Jir-ie Thro< days. This is the topic
that most concerns the miners at this
Â«iiite. In addition to the routine ma't-
U r?, roch a3 reports of committees and
the reading of set papers, therÂ« will be,
as aiuiou^eed by Edward IL Benjamin,
the secretary, several new xnntters to ba :
considered.
A If ifiiag announcement In this dlrec- '
tien is made by Secretary Eenjamin In
a circular letter, in which he writes: "It
is deemed advisable by a number of mem
bers of the association to take steps iia
ir.tiiateiy to stop, i* possible, the actions
cf the Anti-Debris Association in matters
jwriairdng to the regulation of hydraulic

WEAVES CREEK VAX.
Allusion has already been made in The
Call to the rrnposiiion of the miners of
El Dorado county to dam Webber or
Weaver creek. This is one cf the mat
ters ihat will come before the iliaers* As
sociation during the convention. That
the subject may be understood as it is
3 resented by the El Dorado County Min
ers' Association, the substance of the re
port of the committee is published here
with, as ' '.'. <v.!~:
HyiJracllc r=!rir:g would be extensively re
nmÂ«d wizjln thÂ« area drained by Weaver
Creek Â»n<l i'.s fcmche* if eultatle provision j
coold be made for preventing the resulting de- j
t ri* from reaching the navigable rivers of the
fscrtmpr.'.o Vailcy. With the view of deter- J
rr.ir.iZK tlae feasibility of thÂ« erection of such a I
terrier in Weaver CreÂ«>k as would successfully j
bitng about this r**u!t, your committee has |
rr.a<3e careful examination of a eite for a dam
cm that creek which is admirably adapted to
en eh purpose.
At the Junction of H&ngtown Creek with J
Â¦Weaver Creek thfre Is a flat, or valley, which j
Â«5.ter.ds dura Weaver Creek for nearly one
ir.ilfc. and Is about one-half mil* in width, form
inp a basin of flatiand but little above the
l*>ve! cf high water in the creek. At Its lower
fr.A this basin is inclused by abrupt hills,
through which the creek maices its way Jn a
rteep canyon or rorpe of bard metamorphlc I
r<-<-k, "..Â«â¢ -â¢.â¢-Â¦ an ideal eite for a dam acroes
the stream, a considerable portion of which
has b**en already constructed by nature, which
bas also pro\~ided an abundance of material
clo^e at hand and of the best quality for its
completion.
Tour committee estimates that a dam con
structed at this p?ist 50 feet in height would
tack water up Weaver Creek for abcut one
rri>. and thct it would have an average width
cf abcut one-half mile, thus "covering an area
> r . at '.cast 220 acres, aad having a capacity
ivhen BUed of more than 12,0Â«W.OÂ» cubic yards
('. mcunal. Inasmuch as the dam would be
several n-.iies down the creek from where the
pr;cc:p*J mining- operations would be carried
on and the coarser part of the dlslo'ged ma
terial would never reach the Kite of the dam.
}-our committee believes It safe to assume that
puch a dam would provide for the dislodge
merit of at Iea*t 50.00Â«\<yÂ«0 cubic yards of ma
terial as it now II** in the banks to be mined
and would impound and restrain the came
above the proposed harrier for all time to come.
The land that would be inundated ty the
criFtruction of the dam is mostly rolned-cff
bedrock, not fit for cultivation and r>f but lit
tle value, end without doubt the title to thÂ«
feme can be acquired for a moderate coneldera-
COST IS ESTIMATED.
â¢ From such pxdJaZtBaiy estimates as we have
been able tr, make in the limited time allowed
.f"r our work, your committee â¢Â« of the opinion
that the *am of $25,000, Judiciously expanded,
would *ufnce for the complete contraction cf
fv.ch a rÂ»>*tralninÂ«r harrier, and for securing
the title to all the lands to be inundated there

According to Saldanha the Hindoos put
themselves on an equality with the ani
mals of their towns. Should a foreigner
enter the house of a Hindoo he would
probably be somewhat surprised to see
the family seated at the evening meal
with a band of monkeys clambering over
the table for delicacies, a pet camel- coiled
tjp before the hearth or a young' elephant
or two going through kittenish antics.
Mr. Saldanha's remarks, which were
both interesting and instructive, were
given under' the auspices of the British
and American Union. The attendance
was large, and the speaker's wit i and
humor caused much ; laughter and ap
plause.
Â¦ AVhen a miscreant is arrested for a misde
meanor or minor offense. Instead of being sen
tenced to a certain period of confinement he iÂ«
placed in the insect ward in order that the
poor little creatures may not starve.
An interesting lecture on the unlqu9
customs and institutions of the natives of
India was "given last evening in Academy
of Sciences .Hall by, C. F. Saldaiha, late
of the University of Bombay. Mr. Sai
danha is a native of India and appeared
in Oriental costume. Hla remarks were
illustrated by a valuable collection of
stereopticon views, which gave a good
idea of the customs and mode of living of
the modern Hindoo. In particular the
speaker pointed out the- kind-heartedness
of the race. In speaking of their kindness
to animals he said:
In the small towns of India there are erected
what are known as animal hospital*. These
establishments are for the purpose of carins
for animals of all descriptions and sizes. In
one ward you will find elephants. In another
camels, and so on. There Is even a ward for
insects. When a Hindoo 'finds that he is a
victim of flea3 or other troublesome insects.
Instead of killing the tormentor, he carries it
gently to the hospital, where it is well cared
tor.
Interlocutory decrees of divorce were
granted to Sophie McNulty from James
McNulty for neglect, Augusta Baker
from Dr. Almyron Baker for desertion,
Clara M. Sheridan from Matthew Sheri
dan for neglect.
Desertion is charged in the complaint
filed by Bertha Long against John T.
Long. Mrs. Long alleges that her hus
band abandoned her in .August -of- last
year, just seven years after her marriage
to him. Since tha^ time, she says, he has
not supplied her 'with th3 necessaries of
life, though amply able to do so. He
earns, she avers,. $300 a month, and she
asks the court to grant her a divorce and
to compel hlnj to pay her $150 a month
alimony. ._
Desertion is charged in the complaint
filed by Â¦ Clara D. Cowell against Henry
C. B. Cowell, and Martin Hobbs against
Lulu Hobbs.
Mary R. Leibert of 259 Clinton park is
seeking a divorce from George B. Lei
bert on the ground of neglect. She says
that though he earns $180 a month he
does not provide for her or their four
children. They were married fifteen
years ago.
Jn accordance with his usual custom,
Judge Graham yesterday rehised to grant
a divorce on first hearing to two couples
with large families. He continued both
cases for a month, advising: the litigants
as they left the court to try to settle ttieir
differences and become reconciled. The
cases were those of Mary Clark against
James Clark and James McCormick
against Kate McCormick. The darks
have six children, the youngest of whom
Is still -a babe in arms andithe eldest a
girl of 10 years. They are all puny, sick
ly looking children, and their appearance
in court, dressed almost in ragsâ four
with the father and two with the mother
âpresented such a sad spectacle that the
court refused to consider the mother's
plea for a divorce and lectured her on
the advisability of trying to get along
with her husband. He also gave the
father a lecture and then made an or
der committing four of the children to an
institution pending the result of his ef
forts to bring the Clarks together again.
When the McCormick case was called
Mrs. McCormick, who is the defendant in
the action and the mother of three chil
dren, announced her willingness to for
give and forget. Her husband, however,
remained obdurate and refused to accept
her offer to "kiss and make up." The
case was continued.
J. O. Klewish, sometimes known as J.
O. Lewis and also known as G. Lowie,
is the defendant in the suit for divorce
brought by C. Klewish, also known as
Mrs. Lewis and Mrs. Lowle. The charge
ia cruelty. She says her husband is a
man with an uncontrollable temper and
that on the night of October 18, 1902, he
drove her and her 11-year-old child out
of the house and compelled her to seek
refuge with a friend. She also says that
In June of this year he threatened to kill
her with a beer bottle. They were mar
ried at San Rafael May 14, 1901. i Prior to
the marriage Mrs. Klewish was Mrs.
Coover, and she wants permission to re
sume that name.
Louisa Wilkinson wants a divorce from
W. J. Wilkinson on the ground of cru
elty. She says she suffers great mental
agony because Wilkinson cruelly mis
treats her three daughters by a former
marriage. According to her complaint
he choked Annie, her eldest daughter,
Beveral times last year, and in No
vember of this year he attempted to beat
her daughter Frances, and cursed Annie
when she interfered.

A rr.a.a made certain that coffee waa the
rtal cause of his kidney trouble and se-
vere backaches. He saye: "For fifteen
years I have been a coffee drinker, and
finally I proved to my own satisfaction
that the abominable stuff not only started
my kidr-cy disease, but was rapidly mak-
ing me sick all over.
"My tack used to pain and ache terri-
bly, and my wife was affected much the
pane way. A short time ago I became
very ill. I ordered coffee banished from
the house and began to drink Postum in
its place.
"We all began to Improve immediately
and to feel as though we had taken a new
lease on lift-. We kept on improving until
Postum has made us well and healthy
where coffee made us sick. Our back-
aches are gone and other troubles too,
thanks to Postum in place of coffee."

Coffee is a strong diuretic irritant and
jjffects the kidneys in a great many cases
jMere It is not even suspected. If you
value health and a sound body the wiss
thing to do would be ta quit coilee and

Frank Chance Is the latest Calif ornian
to arrive from his Eastern triumphs.
Chance got in the other night, " looking as
Â¦well as of yore. He had a successful sea
aon ,as captain, and first 1 baseman ot . the
Chicago Nationals. He has already been
signed to â¢ play the initial bag for the
Windy City team next year/v 1
tieinK some more stars to the land of the
orange there is a grave possibility the
Jennant of 1904 will also belong to the
southern gentleman.
Undo Harris has not commenced to talk
buÂ«iness yet, or if he has It has all been
done quietly. Uncle will surely have to
annex the signatures of a tew fast men
to his salary roll before they are all
taken up. Of course, Uncle will not take
any more chances such as he did at the
opening of this season. San Francisco
wants a pennant winning team next year,
or if not one that will be In the running
all the time. . i
There are a great many ballplayers
wintering in and about San Francisco and
some of them may be signed for, the
Coast League. Big Bill Everett, the old
Chicago third, baseman, has been looking
the ground over for a few weeks past
and In all probability he will not be
averse to become . a member of some
Coast League team next year. Bill is not
as young, as he was a few years ago, but
still he can field a little and can line out
the fast ones nearly as well as ever.
If we get two; more clubs in the league
next year it won't be a simple task to get
hold of enough fast ballplayers to go
around. Salaries out here are bound to
go up in the event of an eight-club
league and it may : be necessary for the
magnates to invade the two major or
ganizations in order to secure men who
are competent. to deliver the goods In a
community where fast ball must . be
served up. . . . .

The entertainment was in the form of
a concert by the Minetti string quartet
of San Francisco. The programme
throughout was splendidly rendered and
each number was roundly applauded.
Considering <he high class of music to
be rendered, the attendance at the open
ing of the concert was remarkably small,
although all the seats had been sold.
George Mullin, chairman of the entertain
ment committee, made a short address,
explaining that in consideration of the
large amount of money expended in giv
ing the entertainments it was not right
that tho fjrtists should play to empty
houses and that in future those who
bought tickets and who did not wish to
attend would confer a favor upon the
association by presenting their passes to
friends who would enjoy the entertain
ments. Mr. Mullin's remarks were loud
ly applauded. Later on in the evening,
however, the" attendance increased until
there was standing room only.
The programme was as follows:

Six years ago Rose Melville became
famous in an hour in New York by her
delightful picture of a gawky Hobsier
girl, who spoke with the oddest, most
alluring accent, overflowing with wit and
wisdom and a certain homely philosophy.
A year later "Sis Hopkins" was written
for her and with that the young girl, who
but a short while before was practically
unknown, began a stellar career that has
swept everything before it.
Rose Melville, the original Sis Hopkins,
who is conceded to be the greatest char
acter actress on the American stage, will
make her first San Francisco appearance
at the California Theater on Sunday
night. For five years this famous com
edienne has been accumulating a large
sized fortune in "Sis Hopkins" through
out the East and is probably the wealth
iest woman star now before the public.

acter of a Country Girl, Will

The distilling ship Iris arrived yesterday
from Manila end went direct to Mare Island.
where ehe will undergo aa extensive over
hauling. The Iris was bought by the Gov
ernmer.t during the Spanish-American war.
Ehe was fitted up with distilling machinery
and provided with eighteen tacks, each with
capacity for more than 4000 gallons of water.
She carried water for the army and navy
during the Cuban operations and accompanied
the Oreson and Iowa to the Philippines. In
the Orier.t it was found that her distilled water
was not required and ehe was used as a sort
of Coating repair ehop. (
Distilling Ship Iris Arrives.
On the down trip the Colon carried about
thirty soldiers from Acajutla to La Union in
Salvador. They were going to the frontier
of Nicaragua to be on hand, they said, in
the event of trouble between the two republics.
The Colon's passengers included the follow
ing named : Mrs. J. Butler. Miss D. Swartz,
Mrs. E. Carpenter. Mies M. Piper. Miss J. D.
Mara and K. Rogge.
linfT tritnessed the fall of a large meteor on
<he night Of November 1. It illumiratPd the
li.-avens for several seconds and its brilliancy
attracted the attention of those on board the
Marblc-l.ead. Concord and Wyoming, anchored
tt Acapulco. 100 miles away. William Pulli
\an, one of the Colon's oneineÂ«rs, was bitten
fry a scorpion during the voyage. Another en
gineer occupied Sullivan's room on the pre
mous voyage and he. too. suffered from the
bite of a poisonous insect. When Sullivan
went to Dr. E. H. Anthony, the lincr'6 sur
geon, to be treated for the bite, the medico
recalled the poisoning of the other engineer,
and recommended that the room be searched.
An investigation revealed beneath the wire
tnattress of the bunk a nest containing a
whole family of baby scorpions and a few
Â¦duKs. They were brought on board. It is
thought, in the cargo.
Th*Â« Pacific Mail Company's steamship Colon
arrived yesterday from Panama and way port*.
Â£he brought 7J5S tons of cargo and about a
dozen pa^senpers. The people on board tbe
Steamship Colon in Port.
Captain Tupican's summary of the dam
age rtacs like a record of harm done by
a powerful explosion. The after boats
were swept away; the bridge and gang
ways were washed overboard; the stand
ard binnacle was wrenched from its
stand; the poop ladder and ventilators
v.ere torn from their places and carried
overboard, and the cargo shifted.
Another big storm was encountered be
tween Staten Island and Cape Horn, and
all around the eiorm swept headland bad
weather beset the path of the windjam
mer. After reaching latitude 50 south, in
the Pacific, however, the elements took
en a kinder humor and in light winds and
calms the Wayfarer finished her long voy
age.
The British ship Wayfarer, which ar
rived yesterday, 152 days from Antwerp,
reached port sadly in need of repairs. She
was sighted seme months ago and re
ported as being in bad shape. Nothing
more was heard of her until shortly be
fore she arrived ar.d those interested in
her were growing very anxious about her.
She left Antwerp June 14, and on Au
gust 7 ran into a gale which did about
all the damage that could ba inflicted on
one vessel without sinking her. It was
a northwesterly gale and was accompa
nied by very heavy seas, the biggest of
which selected the Wayfarer's decks for
a playground. When the game was over
the Wayfarer was short of nearly every
thing that could be moved from her decks
and of ecme fixtures that were supposed
to be immovable.
Joe Thomas was too big and too strong
for J. Cooper. Cooper was plucky and
willing to mix things, but Thomas was the
heavier puncher. In the second Thomas
dropped Cooper and the latter's seconds
threw up the sponge.
Mike Synfy gained a decision over
George Murdock after four rounds of fast
lighting. Synfy used his right with ad
vantage and had Murdock, who was out
of condition, guessing. Synfy scored a
knockdown in the first round and had the
last round to himself. This won him the
bout.
W. Jansen and Frank Hardy, a sailor,
gave Referee Eddie Graney a merry time.
They tried to land on the referee as often
as they did on each other. Hardy was
awarded the decision for landing the most
blows
Joe Kelly was too big for Willie Carroll
and outpointed the latter. Carroll blocked
half the blows sent by Kelly and landed
some that shook up his lanky opponent.
Dick Cullen outpointed Billy Duffy for
three rounds. In the fourth Duffy came
to life and nearly had Cullen on the mat.
The crowd hooted the decision in Cullen's
favor.
Six good boxing bouts were presented* by
the Amateur Athletic Association last
night in Mechanics' Pavilion Annex.
George Peterson, the amateur welter
weight champion of the Pacific Coast,
nearly knocked the four masted ship' that
William Stewart sails on hl3 chest out of
the ring. Peterson is a sleepy looking in
dividual, but when the gong sounded for
battle he awakened and dealt out left
and right punches that hurt. He had
Stewart at sea and wondering whether he
was being tossed about in a rowboat or
jumping from the topmost yard. Peter
son landed at will for four rounds and
gained a well earned decision.

I LOS ANGELES, Nov. 13.â Portland won
to-day's game without much effort by
the score of 6 to 2. It was Portland's first
victory over Los Angeles on the local
1 grounds. Gray was an easy mark for the
Northerners. McFarlan was a puzzle af
ter the first inning. The local batters
were unable to do anything with his fast
ball' except to pop up high files to the
outfleld. Nadeau had seven chances in
left field and handled them all without an
error. Raymond has a bad hand and Joe
Corbett took his place at short. It was
announced that Oscar Jones of the Brook
lyn Nationals will pitch Sunday's game

OMAHA. Nebr.. Nov. 13.â Special mis
sion work carried on in cities having a
population of 40.000 Inhabitants or more
claimed the attention of the general mis
sionary committee of the Methodist Epis
copal church at its session to-day. Among
the appropriations were the following:
Portland, Or., $500; Denver, $500; San Fran
cisco, $1000; Los Angeles, $500.
Part of the afternoon was given to the
consideration of non-English speaking
work In the United States. For Welsh
work $3S4 was appropriated, Wyoming re
ceiving $200. For work among Swedes
$61,826 was appropriated, including $2100 for
California and $2000 for Puget Sound. For
the work among: Norwegians and Danes
$21,950 was appropriated. For work among
the Germans $41,503 was appropriated, in
cluding California German conference,
$3790; North Pacific German mission con
ference, $4400.
Interest at the morning session centered
In the discussion of the present conditions
of the colored people, especially in the
South. Two members of the general mis
sionary committee, who axe themselves
colored men, the Rev. Dr. Walter H. Nel
son of Huntsville, Ala., and the Rev. Dr.
Henry A. Monroe of Philadelphia, Pa.,
made eloquent appeals for the support of
the work among their people.
No suggestions were made by committee
members looking toward the withdrawal
of support where this was evidently need
ed, and in a number of cases additional .
grants were made above those of last
year. Especial attention was called to the
rapid influx into Oklahoma and an appro
priation of $19,500 was made for the work
in that Territory- 1

The bulky document of twenty-nine
typewritten pages closes with a petition
to the court for discharge from the suit
and judgment for the full costs of the
came.
DENVER, Nov. 13.â Answer was, filed
to-day in the United States Circuit Court
by Tyson S. Dines; Carl S. Chamberlain
and D. H. Rice, as executors; D. H. Rice,
Tyson S. Dines and Moses Hallet, as
trustees, and' I. Harry Stratton, as sole
heir of the VÂ£ S. Stratton estate to the
suit of Stratton's Independence Limited
Company of London for $6,000,000 damages
for alleged fraudulent misrepresentations
as to the value of the Independence mine
in the Cripple Creek district, in connec
tion with the sale to. British investors.
General denial is made of the allegations
of salting or other fraudulent acts on, the
part of Stratton or his agents.
It is further said that plaintiffs had
full opportunity to examine the mine, the
mill, the premises, the books Bhowing
smelter returns and all things pertaining
to the property, and that they did in fact
so examine them.
As a final ground of defense the answer
sets up that the cause of action "accrued,
if it ever accrued at all, during the life
time of "Winfleld Scott Stratton and
against the said Stratton and the same
did not survive his death and did not and
does not constitute any basis for a claim
against the executors of the estate."

NEW TORK. Nov. IX â A movement to cover
shorts among the profesrional traders developed
in the late stock market to-day and carried
prices to a level eubstastialiy over last night.
Ttis was after the failure cf an attemot on
the part of an organlxed bear party to depress
prices to a lower level. Tae activity of this
party has been very apparent all through the
week's decline, but they found themselves prac
tically Â»Â« one in selling to-day and finally gave
up their policy. Their plan of operations
swrned to be a kind of rotation of stocks. Hav
ing eold United States Steel preferred and Penn
sylvania as Jar down as witfcin their power.
they plckfcd out St. Paul to-<iay as the next
leading stock upon which to center operations.
The result was a decline in St. Paul of 1%.
Tb* rwt of the market was very little affected
in Eymparhy. At a result of the late covering
movement St. Paul recovered all of its loss,
and tte most prominent stocks recovered be
tween 1 and 2 pcints. Pennsylvania especially
Â¦was Inclined to recover from its recent de
pressed condition. To-day's gals is two full
joints. United States Eteel completely lost Its
rsc*nt prominence in the trading and fell well
down in the list of active stocks, though it
â¢tared well in the day's strecRth, Tfce baying
seeded confined to professional sources and
there was no evidence cf any large investment
<tf -r-.ar.-i. Neither was there any news to ac
couct fally for the advance In prices.
The *orecfcÂ»t of tie week's currency move
ment Indicated a marked failing off in the in
terior demand and New Tork exchange at Chi
cago recovered iharply. The week in the stock
market warrants tn inference that the loan ac
count cf the bcr.ks has undergone some con
traction. Rejxtfts that the railroads would
concede a reduction on export freight rates for
wÂ»-eei products may have strengthened United
&V*ates Steel preferred, although this news is
indicative cf the general process of contraction
In trade. Tne foreign trade statement for
October was considered gratifying in view of
ft showing of expansion In value in our ex
ports of domestic products of S17.7S2.243. eom
pared with last year, which Is more thaa ac
counted for by the increased value cf cotton

Miss Murray for unprofessional conduct
Superintendent of Schools Langdon would
have to decide whether the board should
try Miss Murray for the language used.
Superintendent Langdon stated yester
day that the principals of the various
schools had agreed to continue the draw
ing course as taught by Supervisor of
Drawing Ball until Thanksgiving. After
that the pupils will be put to work on the
drawing of Christmas cards. Beginning
with the new year a system of models
drawn by Miss Ball will be furnished to
the teachers, and the entire course will
be greatly simplified In deference to the
wishes of nearly all of the principals and
teachers.
the board, all of whom agreed that the
nine samples of drawing were among
those rejected by Miss Murray.
BOARD MAY TAKE ACTION.
The City Attorney yesterday brought
suit -' against Charles and Â«&rry Bush,
owners of a building on Eddy street, to
have the steps leading Into the premises
declared a nuisance. The steps encroach
on the sidewalk.
Would Declare Steps a Nuisance.
"Mrs. Ostrom tells a deliberate lie,"
said Miss Murray in excited tones. "I will
smash her face. I'll punch her head on
some dark night. Even if she substan
tiates it, she'll get it in the neck some
day."
iWoodward was thunderstruck at the
words, sure jthat he had.
heard aright "he' Jotted, them down and!
repeated them to Miss Murray, who ac
knowledged that she . had pronounced
them. President Woodward reported the
matter to the Board of Education, which
is now considering whether action should
be taken against Miss Murray. Mrs. Os
trom is deeply pained at Miss Murray's
verbal attack, and later brought several
of the teachers of the scfiool in a body to
"Those are not the drawings that Mrs.
Ostrom showed me and which I criticized.
They have been retouched, and are cer
tainly better than those that I rejected."
Woodward informed the irate Miss Mur
ray that Mrs. Â¦ Ostrom had assured him
that the drawings were those denounced
by Miss Murray, and it was then that the
last named made her threats of personal
violence to Mrs. Ostrom.
Mrs. Ostrom was advised to submit the
drawings to President Woodward for his
opinion. Unfortunately the drawings had
been returned to the pupils, but Mrs. Os.
trom succeeded in securing nine of them,
which she sent to Woodward, together
with a communication, in %whlch she
stated that she had submitted them to
an expert, who said they wereft'orthy of
pupils In the High Schools. Woodward
thought the drawings were meritorious
and sent for Miss Murray, who when she
saw them said:
The merry war that is now on in the
school department over the alleged diffi
culty of the drawing course under Miss
Katharine Ball's supervision had an un
pleasant culmination las't Wednesday,
when Miss Elizabeth B. Murray, assistant
supervisor of drawing, threatened to do
bodily violence to Mrs. I. D. Ostrom, a
teacher of the seventh grade in the Fre

her displeasure.
The' threat was made before President
Woodward of the Board of Education, in
the absence of Mrs. Ostrom it is true,
but It conveyed in no uncertain terms the
intention of Miss Murray to vent her dis
pleasure.
It appears that Miss Murray expressed
her dissatisfaction at the drawing work
as done by Mrs. Ostrom's pupils, and
complained to the board that good results
in the study were not being obtained by
Mrs. Ostrom. The last named took issue
with Miss Murray and called a council of
her associate teachers, including Miss
Rose Goldsmith, principal of. the school,
who agreed that the drawings were re
markably good.

"The plans, of course, were designed
to meet the requirements of the Aims
house tract and certainly will not do for
the present site on Potrero avenue, inas
much as the climatic and geographical
conditions are of an entirely different
character."
. There Is some doubt as to whether the
Board of Supervisors has the jlower to
change the location of the hospital from
that originally adopted. If it should so
(â¢ecide then the plans prepared by the
city engineer would be absolutely use
less for the purpose on the existing site.
Having no plans to work on the pro
ceedings would be estopped as the first
course in preparing for the bond issue
was the ordering of the plans by the
Supervisors. It would appear then that
if the site is changed and the plans are
not adaptable the proceedings would
have to be commenced all over again,
even to the submission of the proposi
tion to a vote of the people.
"The Board of Public Works." said
Manson, "has at great expense prepared
plans for a hospital on the Almshouse
tract, a site which I have all along con
tended was not a proper one to minister
to the needs of the afflicted poor. How
ever, upon the order of the Board of
Supervisors, City Engineer Grunsky pre
pared the plans which were adopted by
the Board of Public Works, but which
I now believe will never be used.
Commissioner Manson of the Board of
Public Works intimated yesterday that
this would be the practical effect should
the original intention of the Board of
Supervisors declared in the call for the
election fof public improvements to place
the hospital on the Almshouse tract be
changed.
If the Board of Supervisors accepts the
recommendation of the Board of Health
that the new City and County Hospital,
for the building of which bonds to the
amount of $1,000,000 -were vot*d by the
people, be built on the present site on
Potrero avenue instead of on the Alms
house tract, the bond Issue with respect
to the hospital will, in all likelihood, be
invalidated.

Arthur Davies, executor of the will of
his late father, Llewellyn Davies, the
well-known lumberman, was completely
exonerated of the charge of mismanaging
the estate yesterday by Judge Troutt,
and he was also found to be free of any
intent to defraud his mother, Jane Da
vies. The petition for his removal as ex
ecutor, in which the charges were made
and which was filed by his three sisters,
Belle Davies, Sarah St. Clair and Eliza
Thorrold, was denied, and the order tem
porarily suspending him, issued when the
petition was filed, was revoked. In deny
ing the petition Judge Troutt took occa
sion to state that there was not one of
the young man's acts that could be con
strued into an intent to do wrong to any
one or better himself at the expense of
the rest of the Davies family. "It is
true," said Troutt, "that he made a few
mistakes, but there Is no evidence show
ing that they were caused by anything
but an error in judgment. There has been
nothing Introduced here to show that he
intimated or threatened his mother, or
that she Is in any way incapable. On the
contrary, the evidence shows that the es
tate has been ably handled by the young
man."
Llewellyn Davies died several months
ago, leaving an estate worth $25,000. In
his will ho left It all to his widow, with
the exception of $5 to each of his seven
children. Arthur, and Llewellyn Davies
and Mrs. Davies were appointed executors
of the will in the document. The two last
named declined to serve, and Arthur was
given charge of the estate. The estate
consisted principally of the assets of the
Truckee Box and Lumber Company The
business was greatly developed by the ex
ecutor and was then transferred to a cor
poration called the Davies Box and Lum
ber Company, all the stock of which with
the exception of a few shares, was" held
by Mrs. Davies. For their services in
connection with the business Mrs. Davies
transferred one-third of her holdings to
each of her sons, Arthur and Llewellyn
Intending to provide for the other mem
bers of the family out of the remaining
third and the other funds of the estate
This did not satisfy the others, and they
immediately filed charges against their
brother, accusing him of exerting undue
influence over his mother. It developed
a family row, for the mother and Annie
Moran, another sister, defended the ex
ecutor and strongly objected to the inter
ference of the other children.

well knew that at the time of the

was mentally weak. The document was

Whether the woman took morphine or
whether it was administered to her, either
accidentally or with felonious intent, has
not been investigated by any official. Â¦
The city chemist will probably make
his findings to-day as to the analysis of
the stomach of Mrs. Upson and the con
tents of the pills prescribed for her and
found in her apartment. When the city
chemist has made known the result of his
analysis the date of the Inquest will be
Bet by Coroner Leland, and all parties
concerned will be summoned to give tes
timony.
Up to a late hour last night, the Cor
oner's office and the detective department
had not secured the slightest evidence to
throw any light upon the mysterious
death of Mrs. Upson.
Chief of Detectives Martin finally de
cided last evening to place Detective Ed
Gibson on the case, and instructed the
detective to find the woman's husband
and take him to police headquarters. Up
to a late hour last night Gibson had been
unable to locate Upson. - - â¢ .
The action of the Coroner's office and
the Police Department in the case Is
surprising. Though the doctors that at
tended Mrs. Upson have positively stated
that they did not prescribe morphine for
fhe woman, the statements of Dr. Pres
ton are that when he called' to see Mrs.
Upson early Thursday morning she was
dying from morphine poisoning and short
ly afterward succumbed.
Deputy Coroner McCormick stated yes
terday that until the report of the city
chemlst was made as to the result of the
analysis of the dead woman's stomach
and the medicines found in her room no
further action would be taken.
The mysterious death of Mrs. Irene Up
son early on Thursday morning from
what is presumed to be morphine poison
ing has been treated with startling indif
ference by the Coroner's office and the
Police Department.
No effort was made yesterday by the
Coroner's office to secure any definite
statement from the dead woman's hus
band as to the assertion made by Dr.
Preston that Upson had secured morphine
and had admitted that he gave the poison
to his wife.
No Evidence Is Secured
as to Demise of

ARTHUR DAVIES
IS EXONERATED
Heymans came into notoriety several
weeks ago when Mrs. Charles Colvln
claimed to have suffered the loss of her
diamonds in a lodging-house conducted by
Mrs. Emma Borland at 501 Geary street.
At that time it was alleged by Mrs. Col
vln that Heymans, who claimed to be' a
physician, gave her a sleeping powder
and upon waking from a lengthy slum
ber she found her gems missing. A Mrs.
Moore, Mrs. Borland and D. Christopher
were also mixed up in the transaction,
as the quintet were all drinking together
in the room. Attorney Charles L. Col
vin of Oakland, husband of Mrs. Colvln.
refused to prosecute if the gems were
returned, as he wished to avoid the at
tendant notoriety. The police made an
investigation, but no arrest followed.
Heymans has been arrested several
times for practicing medicine without a
license. He was a solicitor for the real
estate firm of D. Cranston & Son, 114
Montgomery street, up to the time of his
connection with the Colvln case, when ho
was discharged.
Ernest Heymans, who figured prom
inently In connection with the myste
rious loss of several hundred dollars'
worth of diamonds belonging to Mrs.
Charles L. Colvln, wife of a prominent
Oakland attorney, was arrested yesterday
afternoon by Detectives Ryan and Whit
taker for the passing of an alleged
worthless check, and his name entered
on the detinue book at the City Prison.
F. B. Galinde, proprietor of the Vienna
Cafe at 133 OFarrell street, made the
complaint that landed Heymans behind
the bars. The restaurant man alleges
that on September -20 Heymans tendered
a check for J20 drawn on the California
Safe Deposit and Trust Company in pay
ment for a meal and received the change.
Upon presenting the paper for payment
at the bank it was found that Heymans
had no funds in the institution.
Galinde did not report the matter to the
police until October 6, as Heymans had
presented genuine checks for amounts
not exceeding $5 on previous occasions
and it was thought that he would call
and settle. He failed to put in an ap
pearance, however, and detectives were
detailed to arrest the accused.
