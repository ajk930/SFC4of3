NEW YORK, Nov. 15.â William Zeig

said he knew absolutely nothing re
garding the indictments reported to
have been found against him in Jeffer

baking powder measure scandal in the
Legislature. A
Attorney General Crow left for ! St.
Louis last evening, and It is said his
mission was to arrange for the speedy
arrest and return to this State of Zeig

It is said that the arrest of Zeigler
will follow the disclosures and that it
is more than probable a' way has been
found to snatch Daniel J. Kelly, the
legislative agent of Zeigler, from his
haven of refuge In Canada. Should
this be accomplished, it Is believed

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Nov. 15.â
The indictment of William Zeigler, the
multi-millionaire baking powder trust
magnate, was the reigning sensation
here to-day. While it was generally
felt that a true bill would be returned,
yet the fact that the Indictment had
been found was not known until the
metropolitan papers reached here on
the morning train. It is true that the
bill was found mainly on the testimony
given to the Cole County Grand Jury
by Evelyn Baldwin, the Arctic explorer,
vrhom Zeigler sent to the far -north,
and afterward quarreled with; yet the
evidence of W. A. Cochrane, clerk of
the Planters' Hotel in St. Louis, greatly
strengthened the story of Baldwin and
seemingly clinched the case against
Zeigler. '-^'t
Cochrane had refused to come before
the Grand Jury and was brought in on
an attachment. He was fined $15 for
his failure to appear. Cochrane
brought the books of the hotel, show
ing the arrivals on 'March 19, 1901, and
it is believed that the name of Zeigler
was found among those who registered
on that date.

Having fortified themselves with

ond Vice President J. Ross Clark and
Third Vice President Thomas E. Gib
bon Journeyed to Riverside to have a
settlement with Hays. They sent for
him to come to the office of W. SI.
Prck, the Salt Lake Railroad â¢ Com
pany's attorney "at Riverside. He re
plied that he was too busy and asked
that another appointment be made.
Then a peremptory demand was sent
calling him there, and he came.
According to the statements of Clark
and Gibbon he at first made vigorous
denials, but when they presented their
proof be finally admitted that he had
received more from the company than
he had been obliged to pay out In pur
chasing the land for rights of way. He
agreed to make a settlement, and then
and there executed a, deed to the rail-
PROFITS OVER COMMISSION.
As the Investigation progressed other
similar cases were found In which Hays
had acted as agent for the company.
In this *jnnection It is asserted now by
the railroad officials that Hays' com
mission was agreed upon and that
these profits were over and above any
commission, and that the railroad com
pany knew nothing of his having pur
chased property at lower prices than
he reported.
The officials of the company found,
during the course of the investigation,
that in the purchase of rights of way
the company was being held up for
high prices for all kinds of property.
while in reality those who sold the
property 'were not receiving anything
like the amounts which the company
was paying for it. The discovers'
came through statements made by a
wealthy resident of Riverside named
Evans. He Informed the railroad of
ficials that he had been paid a certain
price for property which he sold the
company and reference to the com
pany's books showed that Hays, who
had been the company's agent, had .re
ported that the price was $1200 more
than what Evans had received.
Another case was found In which
Hays had reported that a certain piece
of property had cost 510,000, and that
amount was paid him. The seller of
this property was seen, and he agreed
to make affidavit that Hays had paid
him only 5ST00.
Third Vice President Thomas E. Gib
bon was placed in charge of all right
of way matters last September. Soon
thereafter Mr. Halstead. his law part
ner went to Riverside and found things
which did not look right to him. When
he made his report to the general of
fices of the company a quiet investiga
tion was begun, which culminated last
Tuesday in a sensational scene In
Riverside.
LOS AXGELES, Nov. 15.â As a result
of the discovery of the fact that the
San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake
Railroad Company has been held up
for large sums in the purchase of rights
of way through a portion of Riverside
County. H. T. Hays, cashier of the Or
ange Growers' National Bank of River
fide, has deeded to the railroad com
pany property said to be worth $12,000.
Another result of the same discovery
will be that Major J. W. F. DIss. right
of-way agent, will be dismissed, from
the service of the railroad company,
probably to-morrow.
Hays Is one of the best-known men in
this section of the State and his bank
is perhaps the best known outside of
those In Los Angeles. Congressman M.
T. Daniels is its president and Hays has
occupied a confidential position with
him for years. He managed his cam
paign and secured his nomination.
which assured his election. Daniels Is
now in Washington and .the affairs of
the bank are in the hands of Hays and
<J. Rouse, vice-president.
The bank is not in the least involved
in Hays' financial trouble and is backed
by millions of capital, but Hays' con
nection with It is to be severed within
a short time. To what extent Diss is
involved the officials of the railroad re
fuse to state, except that they assert
that he cannot remain longer in their
employ.

merits of both Colombia and Panama "the peaceful and equitable settlement of all questions at issue
between them." ,
The Colombian Government, according to Minister Beaupre, was disposed to ask for an ex
planation of the instructions, but the Minister informed it that he regarded them, as self-explan
atory.
Beaupre still appears confused about, the instructions sent to him regarding his leave of ab
sence, probably because of the delay. in the. receipt by. him of cablegrams regarding it. He has been .
again, informed that he is at liberty to leave Bogota whenever he desires, and it is expected that he
j will take early advantage of the opportunity. : --
Bunau-Varilla, the Minister from Panama, continued his efforts to-day to obtain recognition
of the new Government by the European nations. Twice he saw Jusserand, the French Embassa
do.r, and to-night Bunau-Varilla expressed the opinion that France soon would accord the recognition
desired. The French Government is anxious that the republic of Panama shall guarantee to the Pan
ama Canal Company and the French citizens interested therein all of the rights, privileges, etc., now
held by them. This guarantee is desired before any steps looking to recognition by France is given,
and to-night Varilla cabled to his Government for authority to make such representations.
To-day he received a long cablegram from Panama expressing thanks to the Government of
the United States for its courtesy in offering the privileges of United States warships to General
Reyes on his arrival at the isthmus of Panama should he desire to go aboard. The cablegram says'
the greatest enthusiasm exists throughout the republic of Panama over the reception given to its
Minister here and to the recognition of the new republic. The addresses of Varilla and 1 of President
. Roosevelt when the former presented his credentials have been published in the various papers of the
country. . â¢
The same cablegram gave authority to Minister Varilla to, make representations to the For
eign representatives here, necessary to effect a speedy recognition of the new republic. The Minister
has suggested to his Government that it clothe the commission now on its way from Panana with
such powers, but the officials there preferred that the Minister should exercise these offices, as he
already possesses diplomatic functions.
- In official circles here the opinion is expressed that the commission consisting of Generais
Reyes, Holguin and k Ospina, which went from Bogota on a peace mission to Panama, are embarked
on a hopeless task. It is now too late, it is said, for anything to be. accomplished.; It is felt certain
here that Panama will not treat with them, as it is not likely that the isthmians will care to become
again a part of the Colombian Government.

the manufacturers a plan of retrench

than a return to the schedule of 1902,
which means practically a 10 per cent
cut in wages. It is believed there is
â¢little likelihood that the manufacturers
can be prevailed upon to reconsider
their decision. That opposition to the
new schedule will take the form of a
strike is still more doubtful.

LOUISVIILE, Colo., Nov. 15.â The of

last night reverses the decision and
defeats the proposition for a settlement
of the Btrike. The sub-district board
met here to-day and canvassed the

The mistake occurred In counting the

and it took but a few votes to change
the decision. Several thousand entered
into the caucus that resulted in the
defeat of the ratification of the agree

During the latter part of the after
noon, however, the interference with
the progress of the cars had greatly
diminished and many of the cars were
half filled with passengers as they sped
along unmolested.
According to the officials of the
company, an attempt will be made to
morrow to operate some of the other
lines of the system if the police depart
ment can supply protection. . Enough
non-union men have been engaged. It
is said, to extend the service in all di
rections if police aid be forthcoming.
As far as. known, no further attempt
was made to-day by either the officials
of the company, the striking employes
or the State Board of Arbitration to
bring about a conciliatory settlement of
the trouble, and the indications to
night are for a protracted struggle.
More arrests were made during the
day than upon any previous day since
the strike was declared. The most
trouble was experienced between Twen
ty-second and Forty-ninth streets. In
the blocks bounded by these thorough
fares crowds of men, women and chil
dren hooted at the police and non-un
ion employes. This was soon followed
by more violent demonstrations. Huge
barricades were piled upon the tracks,
stones were thrown at the cars and
hand-to-hand conflicts between the po
lice and the crowd occurred in several
instances. Several patrol wagons
which had previously been called were
soon filled with prisoners.
One of the men arrested, who gave
his name as McQuade, is said to have
placed a cartridge of large caliber on
the track near Harrison and Clark
streets. Thousands of spectators were
on the street at the time and, believ
ing It was dynamite, became panic
stricken as they dashed for places of
safety. Assistant Chief of Police
Schuttler, who was near at the time,
removed the cartridge and arrested Mc-
Quade.
It being Sunday, the absence of
teams in the streets lessened the
trouble of the police In the matter of
blockades, but another source of seri
ous annoyance were the crowds of idle
sightseers and sympathizers who were
attracted by thousands to the streets
through which the cars had to pass.
CHICAGO, Nov. 15.â A victory, tem
porary at least, was scored to-day by
the management of the Chicago City
Railway against its striking employes.
From early in the morning until dark
to-night the company succeeded in
maintaining a regular service on its
Wentworth avenue line, which extends
from Seventy-ninth street to the down
town district, a distance of eight miles.
Twenty-five cars in all were put into
the service, but the schedule was fre
quently interfered with by delays
caused by obstructions being placed on
the tracks and by the 'inexperience of
men In charge of the cars. . The most
serious trouble occurred during the
morning, when a number of arrests
were made, but clashes. between the po
lice and the crowds that lined the
streets were frequent during the after
noon and when darkness set in it was
not considered safe to send more cars
from the barn. The last car returned
to the barns at 4:30 o'clock' and after
it had been safely- housed the day's
work came to an end.
PARIS, Nov. 15.â H. Kiekeu. an arch
itect, and Lulgi LoLr, a well-known art
ist, who were prominent members of
the Jury which returned a verdict of
guilty acalnst the Humberts on the
trial of fraud, in interviews had with
them declare that the papers submitted
during the trial fully justified an inves
tigation into the possible complicity of
certain politicians in the case and also
insist that the authorities were perfect
ly aware of the Humberts' whereabouts
in Madrid during the latters' stay there,
but were unwilling to arrest them un
til practically forced to <lo so. The re
moval of Madame Therese Humbert to
Rennes and of Frederic Humbert to
Thouars to-day was not attended by
any incident of note. The transfer of
the prisoners ends the regim3 of slight
favors which have been granted to
them at the Fresnes prisons and hence
forth they will both wear the convict
dress.
The programme of the minority is
well defined by the resolution adopted
at the Democratic caucus last night. A
rule cutting off amendments will be
opposed in order that an amendment
may be offered striking out the differ
ertial on refined sugar and eliminating
the five-year clause. The resolution
made it the sense of the caucus that
th<Â» Democratic members should vote
fcr the bill either "upon the adoption
or rejection of the amendment."
With the House- in committee of the
whole. Speaker Cannon will be gtven
an opportunity to further consider the
make-up of the House committees for
the present Congress. l V^- :
Payne of Xew York, chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee, in
accordance with the notice he gave
when he reported the bill on Friday,
will ask the House, as soon as It con
venes to-morrow, to begin Its-consid
eration. A rule will be reported by the
Committee on Rules providing 'for a
vote at 4 o'clock on Thursday without
intervening motion. On the adoption of
the rule the House will go into commit
tee of the whole and discussion of the
Cuban bill will be begun.
WILL VOTE ON THURSDAY.
In the House the bill making effec
tive the Cuban reciprocity convention,
reported by the Ways and Means Com
mittee, will be taken up to-morrow
and disposed of on Thursday. It prob
ably will be sent to the Senate on Fri
day.
Senator Hale, who is chairman of the
Republican committee on organization
of the Senate committees, expresses
the opinion that the organization will
be completed by the close of the week.
Other Senators say it will be impossible
to complete the work until the follow
ing week.
The Committee on Military Affairs
will meet during the week to consider
the nomination of General Wood, and.,
as soon as practicable after the com
mittee reports upon it, the question of
confirmation will be brought before the
Senate In executive session.
It is expected that the Cuban bill will
be received from the House on Friday
and it is probable that a session will
be held on that day in order that the
bill may be referred to the Committee
on Foreign Relations, which will begin
its consideration at or"'?.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.â It is the
intention of the Senate leaders to con
fine as closely as possible the legislation
of the present extra session to the bill
to carry into effect the Cuban treaty,
and with that end In view the daily
sessions of the Senate during the rest
of the week will be brief and another
adjournment will be taken on Thurs
day or Friday until^the following Mon
day. The work of introducing bills and
of presenting petitions will go forward,
but, with the exception of the Cuban
bills, neither bills nor petitions will be
taken up in committee nor for discus
sion in the Senate during the week.
It is quite well understood that Sen
ator Morgan is prepared for a lengthy
discussion of the situation on the isth
mus of Panama, but, while he does not
seem to have taken any one Into his
confidence, the general supposition ia
that he will defer his speeches until
the new canal treaty shall have been
sent to the Senate. There is an under
standing on the part of the Senator
that even though the negotiations for
the new convention be forthwith com
pleted, it will not be transmitted to the
Senate until the beginning of the regu
lar session of Congress in December.

; General Obaldia appeared on the
streets of Panama yesterday for the
first time since November 3, when the
independence of the isthmus was pro
claimed. He was greeted cordially by
friends and acquaintances.
It is "generally asserted that the isth
mians will eventually Insist upon the
separation of church and state, as sep
aration was one of the measures de
manded by the Liberal party in the
last revolution, and the population of
the Isthmus is largely Liberal. *
The question of the admission of Chi
nese Is being seriously discussed by the
press and In other quarters, the con
sensus of opinion appearing to be op
posed to such admission.
The Junta has invited designs for a
Panama coat-of-arms.
We hope the news is exaggerated, or.
if it Is not, that prompt redress will be
demanded for the wrongful seizure. !
The steamer referred to is, Marko
mannia. The same paper, after pub
lishing a telegram from Bogota telling
of probable fighting, says:
Even should a state of war exist, it
would , not Justify the seizure of' a
German steamer. .
America must not interpret the ab
stention from interference on the part
of European powers in Panama as a sign
of weakness.. It is her duty to avoid
any action prejudicial to the interests
of the powers.
We must take the contents of the
telegram -.received as a very ugly ac
knowledgment of that duty.
Should the dispatch prove true, the
holding up of a German ship is an act
which even at the time of the South
African war would have been taken as
an unfriendly act. It is less Justifiable
in this case, as neither a blockade nor a
state of war has been declared in those
waters.

Panama stating that the commander of

eral Plaza, President of Ec
uador, that Generals Reyes, Cabal
leros, Ospina and Holguln are now
marching on the isthmus to "suppress
the Isthmian traitors" has set the en
tire population of the isthmus laugh
ing. Protected by the impenetrability
of the land and the many leagues of
coast line separating the isthmus from
Colombia, and confident that the United
States intends to prevent the landing
of Colmobian soldiers from'the sea,, the
isthmians feel that their security is ab
solute.
The loss of the isthmian territory is,
of course, a tragedy for Colombia. The
Government at Bogota is probably ig
norant of* the attitude taken by the
Government of the United States dur
ing the last two weeks. In a frenzy to
"save its face," to appease an angry
and disappointed populace and to sat
isfy the public demand for some ap
pearance of activity and an attempt to
save the honor and the territorial in
tegrity of Colombia, the Government is
no doubt promising and threatening t^
send' forces to the coast and to take
other aggressive steps. The realization
by the Colombian Government of the
impossibility of sending troops to the
isthmus would not necessarily deter K
from taking those steps which, as al
ready stated, are intended merely to
satisfy the people.
TO FORESTALL REVOLUTION.
Well-informed people on the isthmus
believe that the Colombian Government
is going through all these forms of. or
ganizing expeditions not merely for the
foregoing reasons, but owing to the
necessity of forestalling or weakening
the threatened revolutionary outbreak
In Bogota.
The growing feeling against Presi
dent Marroo.uin Is believed to be due
to the fact that he did not show suffi
cient determination to effect the rati
fication of the canal treaty, which
would have saved the isthmus to Co
lombia, and because he appointed Gen
eral Obaldia Governor of the depart
ment of Panama after Obaldia had de
clared that he would remain a Colom
bian If the treaty were ratified, but
that otherwise he would only be a Pan-

expeditionary army from any port of
Colombia to the isthmus would be fu
tild Both coasts consist of impassable
Jungles, swamps and rivers, without
towns or roads or any. means for the
provisioning of an army. The members
of the junta have not the slightest fear
that any such expedition will be at
tempted, and 'they receive the reports
of such expeditions with equanimity.
What is described here in Panama as
the "United States' broad Interpreta
tion of the clause of the treaty of 1846,
regarding the protection of traffic
across the isthmus," is deemed ample
for. the preventing of the transporta
tion of troops by sea and consequent
hostilities. '
The Pacific Steam Navigation Com
pany, a British concern, plying between
Panama and Buena Ventura, has a
clause in its contract with the Colom
bian .Government which says that it
must "under normal conditions" trans
port Government troops. J.t can, how
ever, be said authoritatively that the
company will not transport Colombian
troops to the isthmus under present
conditions, and that it has not been
asked by the Colombian Government
to do so.

Other vessels which bring troops from
any Colombian port for any point In
the republic of Panama will be frocibly

income, as 'well as the fair yearly sums

gambling privileges in Panama and

sources of revenue do not include $5000

retained $4500, giving to the state of

"As to Major Diss, he was in a posi

to know what kind of a man he was
dealing with." *
Second Vice President J. Ross Clark
to-night fully confirmed the report as
to Hay's land deals and as to his hav
ing deeded to the Salt Lake Railroad
property worth $12,009 in settlement of
what he had collected from them while
acting as their agent. Ross Clark also
stated that the payment made by Hays
was not in consideration of the drop
ping of all proceedings by the railroad
company and that no promisee were
made to him.
Asked directly whether there would
be any criminal prosecution as a re
sult of the discoveries made by Mr.
Gibbon and himself, Mr. Clark stated
that would depend upon what further
investigation disclosed. Mr. Clark
said he had been told by officers of the
Riverside Bank that Hays will have
to resign from that institution and that
his resignation may be expected in a
few days.
"The only reason we have not made
this matter public and the only reason
we wish it could now be suppressed,"
said Mr. Clark to-night, "is on account
of the possible effect it will have upon
the Orange Growers* National Bank of
Riverside. This bank is one of the
most stable in this part of the State,
and there is no reason why this mat
ter should affect its standing, but we
cannot tell what will happen when It
is shown that the cashier of any finan
cial institution has engaged in such
questionable transactions. "We simply
want to protect the bank.
"Hays has secured us so far as we
know and he is going to get out It
would be better to permit him to resign
quietly and get away rather than
cause any trouble to the bank. Con
gressman Daniels, the president of the
bank, is in Washington and until he
can be communicated with and told
what has happened, I suppose Hays
will remain in the bank, but after that
we have been assured that he will
leave.
Third Vice President Gibbon of the
Salt I^ako road stated to-night that the
official! of the company have not de
cided what they will do about the mat
ter. The investigation has only begun,
he said, and it will be thorough enough
to cover every purchase of land since
the company was organized. If other
similar instances of double dealing are
discovered, and he more than suspects
that such cases will be found, he init
mated that resort will be had to the
criminal courts. He stated positively
that Major J. W. F. Diss will to-mor
row sever his connection with the com
pany and that he will no longer bÂ« em
ployed in any capacity. As to whether
Major Diss is in any way involved in
the matter. Mr. Gibbon refused to com
mit himself, but stated that the deal
ings with Hays were in the right of
way department and as the head of
that department Major Diss should
have known what was being done.
Therefore it was thought best for him
to leave the employ of the company.
Mr. Gibbon stated that he has found
other instances in which the company
has had to pay two prices for land,
but as yet he will not say through
whom the company made its purchase.
He asserted the sequel to the story
will be even more amazing than the
first disclosure if the company Is able
to confirm what it more then suspects.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 15.â The case
of the San Domingo Improvement
Company against the Dominican Gov
ernment has been one of long standing.
The Improvement Company, had con
tracts for making various improve
ments and for "certain harbors, privi
leges and dues, which contract the
Dominican Government afterward took
away from the company. The former
sought the assistance of this Govern
ment and asked it to secure its just
rights.
Confirmatory information of the at
tack on San Domingo by the revolu
tionists reached the State Department
to-day In a dispatch from Minister
Powell. He reported that the revolu
tionists were attacking the city on
three sides. There were no other de
tails in Minister Powell's cablegram.
The cruiser Baltimore, which was or
dered to "San Domingo waters, is now
there, so American interests were given
full protection.
United States Minister Powell has
finally carried his point against th.'
Dominican Government that it should
agree to the provisions of the protocol
regarding the San Domingo Improve
ment Company. The Government to
day informed him that it would accede
to his request, carrying out the publi
cations of the protocol and appoint the
arbitrators to-day. This is considered
a great victory for the American inter
ests.

of the lowest prices for food, was 16.1
per cent.
The figures of income and expendi
ture supplied in detail by 2S67 families

NEW YORK. Nov. 13.â The renewed
fall in the price of Pennsylvania Rail
road etock on Thursday and Saturday
of last week was caused by the
manipulation of the Gould-Rockefeller
interests.
The group of Philadelphia multi-mil
lionaires, of which President Cassatt of
the Pennsylvania Railroad is leader,
has suffered tremendous losses by the
recent decline in stocks. Some of them
are crippled. One is on the brink of
financial failure. All of them have suf
fered much more than most million
aires by the recent fall In stocks, for
ihe reason that they have been victims
of a campaign diluted especially
against the companies in which they
v ere most heavily Interested.
This campaign, planned, engineered
and executed by Gould-Rockefeller in
terests as an act of revenge upon
President Cassatt. is intended by them
to weaken President Cassatt with the
Pennsylvania Railroad stockholders,
and. possibly, threaten his control of
the company through a board of direc
tors, which for more than a generation
has been in complete harmony with its
president.
The Pennsylvania Railroad annual
meeting is not held until March and It
is probable that a Rockefeller director
will succeed the late William L. Elkins.
The Rockefellers have never until
this year had or sought to have an
Influential voice in the Pennsylvania
Railroad management, although it was
through that company that the Rocke
fellers made much of their great for
tune.
But no ; John D. Rockefeller's in
creasing desire to control greai rail
roads by ownership, his dislike of
President Cassatt and George Gould's
f:ght for revenge, coming on top of the
Lake Superior and asphalt bubbles,
have brought about a crisis which has
put into jeopardy the entire fortunes
of thÂ» nrroup of great Philadelphia mil
lionaires. Among th^f^e hard hit are W.

The altar proper is in the center of a
pyramidal platform thirty-one by
thirty-five feet with five steps running
along the "our sides of the temple. It
is expected that more statuary will be
brought to light and that the damage
done to the building by the fire applied
by Nero to the city of Rome, plainly
seen in ruins, will bÂ» easily repaired.
The excavating, which was begun by
the Italian Government last July, has
been vigorously prosecuted and now the
whole of what remains of the ancient
edifice has been brought to light.
The principal and most beautiful part
of the monument consists of a rectang
ular enclosure of marble surrounding
the altar proper, upon which the vic
torious Romans were wont to make
their offers to the Peace Goddess. It
has two entrances, one on the ancient
Flamlnlan road and the other on the
opposite side of Campo Alarzio, -where
the Roman soldiers used to drill.
All along the outside of the wall are
sculptured scenes which took place
when offerings to peace were made.
One beautiful carving represents the
procession of Augustus* friends, priests
and nobles on their way to the temple,
crowned with laurel and carrying olive
branches.
ROME, Nov. 15.â If the Czar had paid
his promised visit to Rome he might
have witnessed the uncovering of the
Temple of Peace, built by Emperor Au
gustus nine years before Christ was
born, which had lain buried for centu
ries and whose location was only re

The Pope declared his disapproval of
a rationalistic interpretation of the Bi
ble, not only by laymen, but by clergy
men, and conveyed the impression that
he intended to thoroughly repudiate
the views contained in the latest work3
of Abbe Loisy.
ROME, Nov. 15. â The annual con
gress of Italian Catholic Associations
assembled in Bologna last Tuesday.
The Pope, who considers this congress
of the greatest .Importance to the
church In Italy, sent a letter directing
that the associations lately started in
Italy under the specious profession of
"Christian democracy" be excluded
from participating in the meeting, and
that only those associations which had
been officially recognized under his
predecessors should be allowed to take
part in the work of the congress. Thus
with one stroke of the pen Pius X ably
prevented a rupture between the so
called extremists and the more liberal
elements of reunion.
Only a few weeks ago, when A. Laz
zarini, one of the most influential mem
bers of the Roman committee of direc
tors, started an independent publication
to defend his views on Christian so
cialism, Pius X had a letter written to
him disapproving of the step he had
taken and of the criticisms he was
flinging at the hierarchy.
Baron Braye, who has just arrived
here from the United States, was pre
sented to the Pope by Archbishop
Bourne of Westminster to-day. The
Baron had a private audience with the
Pope, who thanked him ror a scholar
ship of $500 for graduates of all Catho
lic universities, the prize winner to
come to Rome tp the international in
stitute for Biblical studies, which is to
be established.
During the audience with Baron
Braye the Pope spoke strongly on the
necessity for Biblical research and con
demned the efforts of modern writers
to separate the supernatural from the
historical narratives of the scripture.
He insisted that to do so would be as
futile as to deny the existence of the
soul while accepting the material fact
of the body.

Tailoring With Quality.
Our prices speak for themselves. You know that $15 is a
# small price to pay for a made-to-order suit. The question that
arises in your mind is : How is the quality of material and work-
manship?
In answer we say: First, the material is all wool and the
colors are fast. We buy only cloth of this kind. Second, the
making is done by expert tailors on our own premises, under
our supervision. Third, you get our guarantee, which warrants
both the material and the workmanship. We repair, sponge and
press all garments free of charge. Fourth, any dissatisfied cus-
tomer can have his money back.
If 'our $1 5 suits are not as good as the ones you find in
other tailoring establishments for $20 we will â¢ refund your
money, even after we have cut and made up the garments for
you.
Come in some day â let us talk this clothes question over at
close range.
Suits satisfactorily made to order for out-of-town customers

The rare issue was the most promi

Their leaders claim a clear majority
for nearly all their candidates on this
island if all the votes, many of which
were cast out for errors in marking
them, had been counted.
A new feature of the election was a
Chinese vote of considerable import
ance. There were nearly 200 Chinese
in Honolulu who voted. It is estimated
that the number of Chinese voters in
the next election, a year from now,, will
be twice as larse. as there .will be in

not ellclble to vote a year ago and no

In his conference sermon Bishop
Hamilton made a statement that pu
pils in the public schools are deprived
of a very important means of educa
tion through the absence of the Bible
in the schoolroom. In a paper he has
published Superintendent Warner has
combated Bishop Hamilton's position.
He says that if. the Bishop' is correct
the people of this State are not receiv
ing for their children all that they are
entitled to and to secure which they
pay taxes and undergo many priva
tions. He then endeavors to 'show that
Bishop Hamilton's statement is Incor
rect, producing arguments to prove
that the Bible is not a necessary means
of education.
Many prominent Methodists who at
first gave' only partial sanction to . the
declarations of. Bishop Hamilton are
now. disposed to disagree entirely with
Superintendent Warner. The matter
has some political significance because
the school election occurs in December.
The Methodists are . considering .the
nomination of an anti- Warner candi

ble in the public schools." * "i

Western â¢ Union Telegraph Company j
and the Sonoma Valley Expositor of
fice, was narrowly averted at Sonoma I
at an early hour yesterday morning.
During the heavy rain storm the tele- j
graph wires became charged with a :
heavier voltage than they are capable
of carrying and the instruments and
switchboard started a fire. The flames
spread to the woodwork. Mrs. Pauli,
the operator, saw the danger and ex
tinguished the blaze with a bucket of
water. Editor W. O. Hocker of the local
newspaper severed the wires with a
pair of scissors. Soon afterward the
wires started a fire in the woodwork
and it became necessary to have all of
them taken from the building.
Mrs. Pauli and her family and Editor
Hocker and his family occupy apart
ments in the building. Mrs. Pauli was
awakened by the odor of burning wood
and paper. She hurried to the office
and sent her son to alarm tho editor.
There was much excitement around the
office until the danger was over.

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 15.â The Times
has gathered information on the citrus
fruit crop for the season just begin
ning which warrants the statement
that the yield of Southern California
citrus orchards for the season of 1903
04 will be from 25 to 50 per cent
larger than last year, when 22,390 car
loads were marketed. The Times says:
"The most conservative growers and
shippers estimate the crop of 1903-04
Judged by present conditions and
counting on fairly good weather
throughout the season, at 28,000 car
loads, which is an increase over last
year of just about 25 per cent. . Others
predict that 33,000 carloads is not too
high an estimate if the weather con
ditions remain right for the next few
months. This would be an increase of
nearly 50 per cent over last season's
crop, and some optimists say prolonged
warm, growing weather and the ab
sence of frost would expand the crop
probably to 35,000 or 36,000 carloads.
"A few weeks of extreme low tem
perature between now and the middle
of January would do much to retard
growth and ripening of the fruit, so the
size and quality of the crop cannot
be estimated at the present time with
any degree of certainty.
"Whether the crop will amount to
upward of 30,000 carloads or fall below
that number will depend largely upon
the state of the weather during the
months of December and January. Ex
tremely cold weather or unusually mild
weather during the next few months
may easily make a difference of 5000 to
7000 carloads In the size of the crop."

world's production of cane sugar has
exceeded that of sugar made from
beets, the percentage of increase in the
former product for the five years being
about double that of the latter. The
four years from 1900-01 to 1903-04, inclu

BOXBURGHE'S WEDDING
TALKED OF IN SERMON
â¢ On several occasions she had visited
the Palace Hotel and on one of these
visits she met an acquaintance from
the East, who had warmly greeted her.
To this gentleman she said that she
had been married and when he ques
tioned her about her husband she re
plied that his name was Bronner and
that they were temporarily residing at
the Lick. At a later meeting Miss
Boyere appeared to be deeply worried
and said that she was going to live
with friends on Franklin street until
her troubles were over. Of their na
ture, however, she would not give the
slightest intimation. This gentleman
f tnted last evening that he had known
Miss Boyere in the East for seven or
eight years and was able to spedk of
her Jn the hiphest terms.
"She was always a busy little wom
an and for a Ions time she earned a
livelihood for not only herself, but her
father and mother, with whom she
lived in New York," he said.
In appearance Miss Boyere is an ex
ceedingly attractive woman. She is
possessed of a beautiful complexion.
v. h!eh was offset , last evening by a
Jarre black hat covered with a veil of
a similar color and a long opera cloak
of a cream shade, beneath which was
.t pretty frown of light hue. Â¦-Â¦.z^y i
MEETS ACQUAINTANCE.
A6 to her short residence at the Lick
House under a name other than that
given her by her husband when he mar
ried her. she said:
"When we went to the hotel, on Aug
ust 22. my husband told me to register
as Mrs. F. M. Bronner of New York,
and I did so, for I understood that he
was anxious to conceal from his father
the fact that I was here. I left the
hotel about ten days ago and imme
diately resumed my maiden name.
Since coming to the Marions I have
been chaperoned by Mrs. Marion on
the davs that I have gone out, and
they have beer. few. To-night I visit
ed some friends, ~ family which I have
knowri for a long time, and one of its
members escorted me home after the
theater."
Asked if there was any intention on
her part to reopen her case and engage
In further litigation with the Whittells,
Mirs Bovere would not give a direct
answer, but referred her interviewer to
her lawyer.
Although the young woman would
r.ot admit it, it was learned from a
friend of hers, or, at least she had eo
Ftated to him, that Whittell Sr. had
been furnishirs her with money for
romc time prior to the settlement of
(y.p <3ivorco case.
WHY SHE GAVE ALIAS.
"This interview." she paid, "may cost
me a big :;um of money, and for that
reason I would prefer that I should not
be asked to say too much. In fact I
would much rather that you would see
my attorney. I came to the home of
the Marions hoping that my where
abouts would not be known and that I
would escape further notoriety, but it
hefinfi that my plans have failed.
"But I cannot see any reason why
you should not deny that I have been
j,aid money to leave town or that I
agreed with Mr. Whitteil Sr. to do so.
I have no intention of going away from
San Francisco for at least several
months, and when I do go it will be
of my own accord. The story about
tne $1000 being paid to me in addition
to the $25,000 on condition that
I should immediately leave for
the Kast is untrue. Mr. Whit
tell paid me no such amount
and, for that matter the statement that
I received $25,000 as a consideration
in the agreement for a separation,
which might, if invested, also prove to
be considerably -exaggerated."
She refused to give the slightest ex
planation as to what trouble confronted
her. but it was plainly inferred by her
careful remarks that some agreement
as to silence exists between her and
the Whittell family.
ANXIOUS ABOUT MONEY.
Last evening she was the guest of the
latter av dinner and then at the theater,
and it was after she had been escorted
back to the home of the Marions that
she consented to be interviewed. She
was not inclined to fully discuss her
marital troubles or their culmination
further than to set at rest several
rumors concerning her future and the
amounts of money which It was said
had been paid to her to divorce young
Whittell. . .
The handsome young woman has sev
eral acquaintances in this city, among
them a prominent jeweler, a gentleman
who is a guest at the Palace, and a
family whose members reside in the
Western Addition.
About ten days ago. after Whittell
Fr. had undertaken the task of getting
his son divorced, the young wife, real
izing that she was about to face many
troubles and was sorely in need of a
friend and adviser, sought the shelter
of her friends' house on Franklin
street. Once within that welcome har
bor Fhe dropped the name of Bronner
ard has since been known as Miss
Boyere. which is her family name.
Emphasizing her remarks in a man
ner characteristic of a determined
woman, pretty Florence Boyere tolfl
last night of her coming to San Fran
csico with William Whittell Jr.. whose
lather, with the aid of lawyers and a
liberal donation of money four days
ago, secured for his son freedom from
the matrimonial yoke that bound him
to her.
Mrs. Whittell. or Miss Boyere, as she
now prefers to be known, has, contrary
to the desire of the Whittells. made no
preparations to leave San Francisco,
bul is living quietly with Mr. and Mrs.
C. F. Marion at S9S Franklin street,
where she has been residing for the
last ten days. Previous to taking up
her residence there Miss Bovere was
residing at the Lick House under the
name of Mrs. F. M. Bronner. a name
ghe assumed at the suggestion of her
husband, who feared that her presence

â¢You may state positively that I am
r.ot going to leave San Francisco; that
is, not for several months at least, and
you may add that all this talk about
me receiving $1000 from my husband's
father to get out of this city immedi
ately is wholly untrue, as is also the
statement that an agreement was en
tered into between Mr. Whittell Sr. and
inyself relative to my hasty departure
fur the East."
Fred Warren and Al Blanchard.
known in the world of footlights as the
comedian and the singer, found it dif
ficult to leave the stage. Notwithstand
ing the fact that the curtain was
wrung up on the following act several
times the audience demanded their re
turn, and the racket of the encores
would not cease until they did. Much
of their work Is new, and the popularity
they attained last week Is increasing.
Albert Bellman and Lottie Moore pre
sent their success "A Gallery Goddess."
It excels their sketch of last wee"k, and
the closing song is heartily applauded.
The "Village Choir" quartet sing new
songs, and the Jack Theo trio, in acro
batic turns, is well received.
A more than appreciative audience
greeted the new bill at the Orpheum
yesterday afternoon and evening. The
entertainments were of the. high order
and each number was greeted with ap
plause. The new turns were excellent
and the hold-overs the cream of last
week's performances.
Wright Huntington and his company,
including Florida Kingsley, opened in
a dainty sketch, "A. Stand-Off." Hunt
ington was at his best, and with the
able support of Miss Kingsley and Alex
Kearney gave the audience all it an
ticipated. Unlike many other playlets
that have been presented, the act has
a plot that- is cleverly worked out. It
opens with complications, that grow
deeper as the play proceeds, then come
to a happy termination in probable
and natural fashion.
The Brittons, colored vocalists and
dancer*, are back again and well earn
their title as America's foremost col
ored couple in vaudeville. Sara and
Bella Rosa, novelty acrobats, are giants
in strength and do wonderful work in
balancing and maneuvering with heavy
weights.
Phil and Nettle Peters present "My
Husband's Double." Why they find
such a title for their act is not quite
clear, but they afford a barrel of fun
while they are on the stage, and their
work Is more than good. The three
Zolars, European society gymnasts, in
troduce many new features in their
line, and their hand-balancing is ex
cellent.
All through the play there is too
much overacting, which is largely the
fault of the play Itself. Louis Morrell,
who played the part of Adison Vibret.
the villain, was so thoroughly villain
ous that the gallery laughed excitedly
whenever he was foiled and breathed
deeply during the periods of his
triumphs. Frank Minzey, as the true
and honest farmer who follows "Sis"
through her various peregrinations
and finally wins a vindication and her
heart, was one of the refreshing feat
ures from an acting line.
Under two acts of "Sis Hopkins" and
the villain the audience became restive,
but the dramatic climax at the end of
the third act atoned for everything.
There it was that Miss Melville
brought into play her best abilities and
with the skillful help of George M. Max
well, who played the part of a father
who had lost his memory through
worry over the absence of his daughter,
created a scene that thrilled every one
present to the heart fibers.
There is a scene in a girls' seminary
in which several specialties are
dragged in by the heels in the second
act. The atoning feature of their in
troduction is that they are all good.
Catherine Camp made an especial hit
with a yodel song and was recalled
several times. Edward Hume, who
bore with much ability an indifferent
part in the play, developed Borne won
derful dancing abilities and James Mc-
Duff, the funereal portrayer of the
character of Obadiah Odium, capper for
a village undertaker, gave some good
imitations. Throughout the play he
acted up to his comedy part in good
fashion and was one of the striking
characters of the play.
â¢Sis Hopkins" will run a week, and
owing to the large advance sale an
extra matinee will be given Thursday,
rather an unusual feature for the Cali
fornia, Any one that wishes to 6ee a
show that is humanely stirring must
not overlook Miss Melville during her
Fhort engagement here.
"Sis Hopkins" broke on the San
Francisco public last night and the
packed house at the California, from
boxes to the gallery, watched her de
velopment from the awkwardest of
country girls to the maiden finished by
a course of European travel with an
interest that went the full gamut be
tween laughter and tears. Rose Mel
ville, famed in press and prints as she
has been, is a revelation. Her art is
deeper than can be conveyed in words.
She must be seen to be appreciated.
More thaft that, she is the whole show.
The dramatic situations of the play
are saw-edged. They, remind one of
the old time dramas that are spending
their waning life in the cheap resorts
of Coney Island in the summertime or
blossoming on the north side in Chi
cago for the perennial joy of the thea
ter goer. Out of such material, cheap
as stage tinsel and tawdry as a painted
scene of a regal palace, Miss Melville
has evolved a series of striking pic
tures which cling to the memory with
all the tenacity of a tragedy in one's
own life.

The German financial world was com
pletely surprised by the announcement
of the combination, not the slightest
intimation of which had leaked out
until the matter was published In to

vague suspicion, however, that some

on the market were unable to explain.

R. C. Staats Company, Berkeleyâ Activ
ity Jn the Berkeley real estate market
is increasing, and the prospects are Rood
for a very busy winter. Our business
has increased considerably In the last
year, and more especially since the inaug
uration of. the new ferry system. ThÂ«
opening of the new system has increased
the value of Berkeley real estate very
materially, and we are receiving many
inquiries* from San Francisco people re
garding home sites. From present indi
cations I think that the northern and
eastern portions of the town will be rap
idly built up.
BIG SALE RECORDED.
To prospective purchasers, outside of
any business interests I might have In
the matter, I would certainly advise an
immediate investment, as property can
be purchased that will present three val
ues, viz.: horn**, interest producing and
speculative, and as we are restricted on
our beautiful little Island as to territory,
the chances for an advance In prooertv
is much mreater in our city than any of
the neighboring towns..
The time is shortly sure to come when
Alameda will have an electric suburban
system which tt!!! place it within shorter
communication with the business center
of San Francisco than many portions of
San Francisco County which are not
much more than half way to the tatter's
county line.
During the past month we have sold
eighteen vacant lots upon which a num
ber of substantial buildings are under
construction. We have also sold si.i
residences, one business block, four flatd
ana negotiated two exchanges.
The demand for property is not confined
to any particular district. We are re
ceiving numerous letters from our East
ern friends and others who are respond
ing to our newspaper advertising, nearly
all of which with a view of making Oak
land their future home. The indications
are that this will be the liveliest winter
seen in Oakland for many years.
W. K. Conger, Alameda â As a real es
tate dealer in this locality for many
years my observations lead me to believe
that the outlook of property on thlj aid*
of the bay, particularly In Alameda. waj
never brighter than at the present time.
The climate, soil and natural geography
of this suburban city cannot be sur
passed; and while we have experienced
no boom, the steady growth of this clt>
carries with It a confidence of real estate
values.
Activity in the Alameda County
realty market seems to be increasing,
in spite of the fact that the winter sea
son is usually dull. Since the open
ing of the new ferry system people in
San Francisco and other towns around
the bay are waking up to the fact that
Alameda County property is a good
investment and real estate speculators
also seem to believe that values In Oak
land and its vicinity will increase, a*
many are Investing heavily in su
burban property.
The papers in the interior of the
State are commenting upun the rapid
growth in the population of thla city
and the large number of handsome
houses within Us boundaries. Real
estate dealers say that every day they
are receiving: inquiries from old resi
dents of San Francisco in regard to
homesltes on this side of the bay.
Although the rainy season is already
at hand, there seems to be no decrease
in the activity in building circles.
People who have purchased property
for home building are going ahead
with the erection of their houses In
spite of the wet weather.
In Berkeley work has just been be
gun on the foundation of the new bank,
which will be erected on the corner of
Harmon and Adgline streets. The bank
building will Be a two-story brick
structure and will cost $10,130. Besides:
the new bank and several other busi

THE ELECTRICAL POWER.
The development of electric power
whereby the energy furnished by the
fall of mountain streams is converted
Into electrical energy serves In part as
a solution of cheap power in California.
Until petroleum and electric power
were developed it was a serious ques
tion as to whether manufacturing in
dustries could compete with those of
the East where there was an abundance
of fuel. Now, however, we have fuel
and raw material sufficient In most sec
tions to supply power to serve Indus
trial enterprises.. There Is now in the
neighborhood of 140,000 horsepower de
veloped in California from mountain
streams, and I understand that more
Chan 80,000 horsepower additional is
being developed. .
California's large import of beef cat
tle, poultry productions, swine and
manufactured goods has demonstrated
a home market that should be sup
plied from California resources. The
effort now being made Is to secure the
population to develop these resources.
Commencing at the Mendocino" line
the southern division is paralleled di
agonally from southeast to. northwest
by the . Chemise, Rainbow and Cooskie
Mountain ranges throughout its. entire
length of nearly fifty miles. This divis
ion is admirably watered by four prom
inent . streams â the Mattole River,
South Fork and main Eel River and
Larrabee Creek â and their scores of
tributaries. These streams/except the
last named, have their sources in Men-Â»
docino County, and all carry a con
siderable volume of water throughout
the summer months. A feature of this
division is that along the eighteen miles
or more of coast line, from Shelter. Cove
to the mouth of the Mattole River,,
thirteen streams flow from the Cooskie
Range to the sea. .
Dobbyn Creek and the south fork
of Van Duzen River are also promi
nent streams in the eastern portion."
In short, the water supply is equivalent
to any natural demand in the interest
of, many times. the present population,
and wherever water Is found fuel wood
as well as merchantable timber exists
in abundance. West of Bear River
and Rainbow ridges the surface. is un
dulating, often abrupt, and is chiefly
devoted to grazing. Generally the ter
ritory east of. the South Fork to the
Trinity line is given over to ' stock
raising, though a great portion of this
range land is admirably adapted- for
grain growing and orchard purposes.
The Woods ranch of some 15,000 acres,
now owned by James W. Henderson of
Eureka and extending from Garberville
into Mendocino County, has: testified

be made more instructive and compre

three divisions, the first including that
portion between the Mendocino line
and the mouth of Eel. Riverâ the line

such line to the south limit of Trinidad,
Klamath and Orleans townships,' and
the third from that line to the south

line, is over 100 miles In length
from north to south, and has an aver
age width of thirty-five miles. In
square miles its area is 350%. and in
acres 2.244.4S0. Fully one-half this.ter
ritory is covered by forest, 475,000 acres
of which is redwood.
With the above facts vouched for,
otherwise well-informed people fre
quently ask: "Is there room and In
ducement to invite any considerable
addition to the present population?"
One who knows the county familiarly
in its length and width, with its par
tially developed ' resources, could make
this candid answer: "Under favorable
conditions and with the promised
coming of a not far distant new era
in existence, there is room and induce
ment for five persons where there is
one now, and that without objection
able congestion."
In all this vast extent of territory,
there is only a small quota that will
not produce abundant crops with
minimum effort and without irrigation.
Land that has been denuded of red
wood timber will, with ordinary prepa
ration and care, produce abundant
crops of clover, fruit, grain and vegeta
bles, and this land can now be secured
at a much lower price than land. in the
great agricultural valleys where irri
gation is required to insure crops.

! The extreme northeast portion of this
division, including the valley of the

Is the entrance to Humboldt County's
mining domain, in which a gold harvest
has been reaped continuously for fifty
years. Most of this mineral territory
was acquired through the disorganiza
tion of old Klamath County, nearly
thirty years ago. The deposits are
mainly, of the high gravel class, though
gold is often found in paying quantity
in the: river: banks and bars.' In years
agohe the Chinese Flat mining district
contributed materially to the gold pro
duct of Northern California.
' Forty > years ago Â¦ Trinity River was

has a number of important tributaries,
all of which head in the South Fork
mountain range, while the south forjc of
Trinity River is the recognized eastern
boundary of the division and county.
' In this central portion the dairying
interest is largely in evidenceâ from the
point of Table Bluff to Yager Creek,
and in. the. Salmon Creek and Buck

along the bay shore from Ryan Slough

added more than 1000 acres between

no less is it intended to record the ad
vance of the units that make up the
These are some of the general topics
that induce The Call to provide for giv
ing to the public such Information on
material matters relating especially to
the welfare of -California, as may prqve
of profit. The growth of cities and the
lines of development along which they
are moving are of no less interest.
Writers will treat of the cities. The
extension of municipalities furnishes a
sure index to the general growth of the
prosperity of the country surrounding
them, and especially is this true in the
great agricultural State of California.
Cities have their problems that are of
interest to smaller communities." In
these problems is often immediately in
volved the question of prosperity in a
marked degree. Fortunately there are
organizations in the California dtie9
and towns competent to supply and al
ways willing to give information con
cerning all good citizens.
MATTERS. IN DETAIL.
Intelligent men see. that in the pres
ervation of the forests of tho Pacific
Coast means not only conservation of
water supplies, but also keeping timber
enough always for home uses and for
the home building of a great people.
Forestry has become a science engag
ing the attention of a great part of
the world. To cut trees judiciously pre
serves the forests. The thinning out
process, the elimination of dead trees
as a precaution against extensive and
vastly destructive forest fires has been
recognized as necessary. This is ?*> far
removed from the plans of the parties
who denude the land of all Umber of
commercial value and then burn the
lands over as not to be spoken of .as
at all similar in import. Ths National
Government Is taking an active part in
formulating a policy for the preserva
tion of the forests, such as will not de
stroy the timber supply nor yet de
prive the people of the use of such tim
ber as may be needed. This theme Is
capable of wide treatment and it will
receive, at competent hands, all the
attention that space will permit and
public interest demands.'
Regarding the conditions as a whole
prevailing in this State, there seems
to me nothing of which we have any
right to complain.
All lines of industry are active and
prosperous. The general health of the
State is first class. Business is stable,
money is plenty, enterprise is rife,
people are coming, more are being in
terested, and the general march of the
State, re i in sections but in its entire
ty, is onward, making rapid strides
toward the great destiny which we are
all convinced awaits California.
o:i::i::n : i:::::::
makes Chicago and other great Eastern
communities so thriving.
These general considerations involve a
vast variety of details that will be
treated of for The Call by special writ
ers who know whereof they speak. The
possibilities of the Sacramento and San
Joaquin valleys under irrigation Is a
theme to be treated. Special writers
will deal with the subjects of mines
and mining, of forestry, of electrical de
velopments and the various phases of
cheap power, the key to tho manufac
turing era that destiny has in store for
California.
The new industrial year opens up
under favorable conditions. The rains
of the last week, coming down gradu
ally so as to be absorbed by the earth,
which has lain parched all summer, will
not enly bring vegetation and give a
cover of verdure and new life to the
landscape, but will start the farmers
all over California to preparing their
ground and planting the seed for an
other harvest. Â» . ..
Another feature which has tended to
stimulate enterprise and add to the
prosperity of California is the steadily
increasing immigration to this State,
and particularly the increasing num
ber of tourists, made posible by the
good times prevailing throughout the
country.
past has been one favorable to
the California farmer. Wheat and oth
er cereals have brought good prices.
The fruit men, as a whole, have re
ceived such returns on their products
as have left them a margin on the
l>roflt side of the ledger. These condi
tions have reflected themselves on all
lines of business in California and have
resulted in a very prosperous year.
Added to this may be mentioned the
increasing commerce of , the Coast,
which has manifested itself in the way
of stimulated activity within our sea
ports and other trade centers.
As is natural under such conditions,
building in the principal cities has been
brisk, which, in turn, has stimulated
the demands for labor, for lumber and
for all the commodities that enter into
construction.

If a man is settled right he becomes
a tax producer and contributes, not
only to his own wealth, but to the
wealth of every one in the StatÂ«. If the
settler is not satisfactorily located he
becomes a. tax consumer. For this rea
son the-resources of California will not
be of advantage to the settler unless he
is well placed, nor will he be a factor
In the development of the State un
less he produces Â¦ as well as consumes.
The warm encouragement given to all
classes of producers on the part of Cal-
It is : largely due to the special ad
vertising of California's industries that
persons who have been previously en
gaged in those k industries elsewhere
take up similar callings in California
and pursue them satisfactorily^ If a
man wishes to go Into poultry raising,
we have In our interior section ad
mirably adapted to that industry. If
he wishes to engage in small farming
we can suit him. "If he wishes to en
gage in dairying there are ' many sec
tions- where he will not make a mistake."
The same rule holds true of many In
dustries.
Indeed there are dairymen- who pre
dict that in ten years California will be
the chief State in the United States in
the export of dairy products. With a
growing population and an Increasing
local demand there has been no serious
danger In California of overproduc
tion. In fact the demand for products
has been fully sustained, despite the
Increasing output.
When one considers that California is
the second largest State in the Union,
with a seaboard greater than the entire
Xen- .England coast, and that it has a
population considerably less than two
millions,' despite its natural resources,
a logical reason appears why a desir
able class of people should be invited
to come to this State. â¢ },
It Is not the purpose of any organiza
tion Interested In our progress to ob
tain an . unwilling settler: the idea ia
more to choose from the vast resources
present in this State what will most
suit the individual.
ADVERTISING RESOURCES.
RETURNS FROM FARMS.
Small farms In California have been
found to yield large average returns.
The cultivation of small fruits, berries
and vegetables, as well as dairying,
poultry and stock raising, etc., is to be
encouraged when local conditions are
favorable. Large tracts have been sub
divided and are now yielding, under in
telligent cultivation, great average
profits per acre.
No Industry has done more or will
do more to develop California than
dairying. Conducted on a scale of the
present it is of comparatively re
cent origin. A large acreage of alfalfa
amounting in California to upwards of
300,000 acres has encouraged this indus
try, while climatic conditions permit
cattle to be pastured throughout the
year without housing, giving favorable
contrast to the East, where it is neo
essary to feed and house cattle through
the winter.
This invitation on the part of Cali
fornia to the independent and resource
ful settler of small means is, to my
way of thinking, the greatest element
in the development of the interior re
gions of this State. It is by peopling
the great fertile valleys of the San
Joaquin and Sacramento, our Irrigated
stretches south of the Tehachepi, our
coast counties and the fertile grass
valleys of our mountain counties, that
California will yield the greatest of
which she is capable. This, to my mind,
is the finest thing which can be
achieved by any person, nation or
State; in other words, to put to good
use all resources.
THE GREAT ELEMENT.
is not to be found in the large
averages of a phenomenal year, but
rather it te in the steady growing in
many sections of the State and the in^
crement to average wealth, that tells of
substantial advance among the citizens
at large. j
The large addition to our rural popu
lation of a class of citizens. who farm
on a comparative small scale and who
cultivate the land intensively is not
only a favorable comment on the char
acter of the productive wealth of Cali
fornia's soil, but it is the most hopeful
sign of the capacity of this State to
support a great rural population.
Perhaps the clearest indication on the
part of California people to admit and
welcome among themselves, settlers
from other States, is the growing ten
dency t > break up large holdings of
land into small tracts so that there
may be an opportunity for the man who
wishes to cultivate a limited holding.
Of course, every one realizes that there
was for many years an inclination to
keep the land in great blocks, which
discouraged or made it impossible for
the Eastern farmer to get any consid
erable foothold here. This was partly
due to the fact that holdings were
through larze Spanish grants confirmed
upon California's entrance to the
Union. . *

In these few preliminary words th*
object that The Call has In view may
be sufficiently indicated. A weekly

eminently an agricultural and mining
State by reason of soil, climate and by
the wealth of gold, copper, petroleum,
coal and other minerals that are in its
ledges and sands, yet geographical pos
ition confers a wider destiny on Cali
fornia than being only the garden of
the world and source of supply of the
precious metal, gold.
Its relation to the Orient and the
islands of the Pacific, which have been
the theme for many years of those who
have seen the great harbor of San
Francisco and the seaward passage
afforded by the Golden Gate, may be
even dwarfed into Insignificance by
the new waterway to be opened up for
proud fleets moving between Califor
nia and the ports of all the world. This
phase of the new prospect for Califor
nia will be treated soon by an intelli
gent writer of prominence. So 6urely
is the canal through the Isthmus of
Panama to open great possibilities for
all dwellers on the Pacific Coast and
especially for California, that earnest
thought is directed to that measure of
public concern. â¢>;'-
The distance to all markets will be
shortened by water by thousands of
miles for all agricultural and other pro

important than this is the considera

who sits in the Presidential chair shall
have succeeded in making the Panama
canal an actuality, the day of high
freight rates between California and all
other parts of the world must fall in
both directions to meet the lower cost
and profit needed for Bea carriage of

teen grain warehouses in the city, with
an aggregate capacity for storage i?f
175.000 tons. Not all the grain in the
county is warehoused. Much of It is
shipped directly to San Francisco by
boats that load from the/ teams. But a
very considerable volume of both wheat
and barley finds its way into the Stock

twenty-five to thirty-five tons per year,
worth from $200 to $250 per ton. This
year his crop was about twenty-five tons

mining by hydraulic process and lessened the flow of detritus
into navigable streams in this State. Slickens could not,
however, be arraigned for all the impurities to be found in

a beverage remain and in the nature of river environments
will continue. The Sacramento Bee has undertaken to edu

Secretary Foster of the State Board of Health is first quo

cases of typhoid fever and also for many diseases. He urges
the citizens of Sacramento to provide some plan for the de
struction or disposal of sewage other than by turning it into
the river and also advocates measures. to prevent the defile
ment of the river above Sacramento. He has served notice
upon Sacramento that it must cease turning its unpurified
sewage into the stream that flows through it.
The Bee has called into council H. T. Cory, at one time
dean of the College of Engineering of the University of Cin
cinnati. According to Mr. Cory's view of the situation it
will be impossible to make the waters of the Sacramento
pure either below or above Sacramento and satisfactory for
drinking purposes without artificial purification. If Sacra

Causes of Failure.
Analyzing the causes of failure In the
United States in 1902. American Indus
tries finds that out of 9371 failures, 20
per- cent were due to incompetence. 30
per cent to lack of capital, 17 per cent
to special circumstances beyond the
business man's control, 10 per cent to
fraud and 7 per cent to inexperience.
Lack of capital, it appears, is the most
dangerous factor in the business life,
as it is the greatest obstacle to getting
into business. Incompetence, together
with inexperience, which amounts to
incompetence, accounts for a very large
percentage of failures. If to incompe
tence and inexperience we add "unwise
credits," we find that 30 per cent of
failures are explained. It amounts to
this, in brief, that nearly a third of
those who fail in business are not well
qualified for it; another third try to do
too large a business, and the rest fail
by reason of fraud, competition, ex
travagance, neglect, failures of others,
speculation and causes beyond the wla
est man's control.â Baltimore Sun.

The First Rains.
There is gladness in the canyon, there is
music there to-day:
A rippling and a prattling in the little,
baby stream.
The great, majestic mountains brood in
. cowls of somber gray;
And the Great Mother moves in sleep
with promise in her dream.
Like little maidens dancing.
Come the brown waters glancing
Where the fitful shafts of sunlight thro'
the Spanish mosses gleam.
There is music In the canyon. On the
laurel's glossy leaves
The rain comes pitter-patter with a
gentle, lulling: sound:
And old Nature's busy shuttle a varied
pattern weaves, _
Where tiny runlets wander o'er the
thirsty, sun-baked ground. .. Â¦
The wind comes softly over
With subtle breath of clover;
And a hint of little secrets that were
In its journey* found.
There is music in the wheatland where
the autumn stubble lies;
And laughter where the little stream
its greater kinsman joins;
Such Joy and Jubilation in the bounty
from the skies.
That cools the breast of brown old
earth, and laves her dusty groins â
And she thrills with passion's fire:
And she throbs with great desire;
To .release the life renascent In the deep
ness of her loins.
Ah! the music in the canyon finds in
yearning hearts to-day
An echo in the symphonies that deep
and dormant He:
For the sky that seemeth grievingâ the
.mountains mourning gTay â
Are segments of the promise of a har
vest by and by.
Like the prisoned life in earth,
Shall my soul renew its birth-
Rise to love and youth immortal tho'
Death croons a lullaby!
il -G. N. LOWE.
THE late C. P. Huntingtoh had a positive genius for
estimating the capacity of a country for future devel
opment. He and his associates built railroads for
developmental purposes, and halt the strength to retain con
trol of them and the patience to wait for the profit that was
sure when people came to touch latent resources into life.
He had a high idea of the future of the Congo Free State,
in Africa,. and showed his faith by investment in a railroad
in that region. He believed that there the United States
would find a field for commerce of such magnitude as to
deserve our sympathy with the King of Belgium in his ef
fort to make commercial conquest of the country.
The Congo Free State is in tropical Africa and its north
ern third js traversed by the equator. But, except the neck
that follows the Congo River to the coast it is a high pla
teau, densely forested and with a climate less trying than
other parts of equatorial Africa. Its area is 900,000 square
miles and its population 14,000,000. The world owes its
first knowledge of Congo to the explorer Stanley. In 1897,
in an address to the Savage Club, at Durban, he indulged
in this retrospection: \
"I have just come back from Victoria, that wonderful
country which ought to have been ours. But this was not
our only mistake in Africa. When I came home from my
exploration in Central Africa I was met at Marseilles by the
representatives of King Leopold, that most perspicacious
and well-informed monarch, with most brilliant and fair
proposals, but I thought it my duty to go first to England
and offer my countrymen that marvelous land I had trav
eled through. I gave ninety-nine lectures and presided at
almost as many meetings, and when I saw how little they
appreciated what I had done and how little they realized the
enormous riches of the Congo, I felt disgusted with my own
people, and, keeping my promise, I went to Brussels, where
I met King Leopold. Every one sees to-day the marvels
Leopold effected in that country, how well he was helped by
hii subjects, and the world is amazed at what Belgium has
done. There was our mistake, gentlemen. The Transvaal
ought to have been ours, and you refused the wealth I
brought you from the Congo River."
We quote this because we have been getting too much of
what we think we know about the Belgian administration
of the Congo from English sources, and it is apt to be
tinged with disappointment that what is probably the rich
est part of Central Africa was permitted to slip through the
fingers of Great Britain. Among the statements that have
been current are many absurdities, and it is worth the while
of the American press and public to seek the facts and to
acquire a better knowledge of the vast commercial possibil
ities of the Congo, which have for us a peculiar interest.
The Congo nati'/es were cannibals and had a lot of hideous
customs, such as mutilation of the dead, a system of slavery
and savage practices in war. While Belgium has had to
use stern measures to eradicate these barbarisms, there is
no evidence that the agents of King Leopold are using any
means that are unnecessarily harsh to effect the civilization
of the millions and convert their fine qualities and rplendid
energies into activities useful to themselves and the world.
It was the opinion of Mr. Huntington that they could be
transformed into a nation whose trade the world would
eagerly seek. Mr. Lerman, an Austrian and member of the
International African Asociation, says: "The natives had
long practiced mutilation of the dead. . It had existed for
centuries, and the state does its utmost to suppress it. But
the state has existed only eleven years. How can it be ex
pected to obtain in that brief time a result similar to that
obtained by Belgium herself after eighteen centuries in
building up a state out of a region where Caesar found hu
man sacrifice practiced by the Druids and where torture
prevailed in the middle ages? In my native country slavery
was abolished as late, as 1848, and did not cease in Russia
until 1862."
Mr. Brown, a Protestant missionary, writing to the Lon
don Times, says: "Things have vastly improved in the
Congo as far as the natives are concerned. During my nine
years' work there I have seen vast improvement in the gov
ernment of the country." Mr. Grey, the English engineer,
says the slav;e trade has ceased, the traders being afraid to
come near the Belgian posts. To such an extent have con
ditions changed with the advent of Belgian administration
that many small chiefs are now recovering individuals raid
eu" from their tribes by stronger neighbors, who had not
been already sold when Belgian control reached the country.
The late British Consul, Pickersgill, in his consular report,
said that credit is due to Belgium for the decline of canni
balism, though complete purgation from that evil will re
quire a long time. Â§0 it is evident that slavery, cannibalism
and the practices of barbarism are being dealt with by Bel
gium, and that kingdom should, especially in this. country,
get deserved credit for its work.
The natural resources , were evidently not over-estimated
by Stanley. The country is rich in rubber, in the valuable
hardwoods of commerce, in- minerals of all kinds, and the
density of its native population shows it to be probably the
best of all the tropical countries on the planet. . With . Bel
gium friendly, as she is, to American enterprise, there is in
the Congo a field for our surplus energy, and it is to be a
field for a share of our surplus production. When our
isthmian canal is finished this coast will be brought within
easy reach of the mouth of the Congo. By dropping south
through only, thirty degrees of latitude we will be on an
almost direct line with the Congo River, which, no doubt,
drains the richest part of Africa. -,.
Scarcity of Maple Sugar.
"The maple sugar crop, like every other
crop, is much below the average this
year," said a wholesale dealer in Murray
street the other day. says the New York
Times. "The supply from Vermont, our
main reliance for New York and the ex
port market, la about 40 per cent below
normal. In a good year we get 330,000
pounds of maple sugar from Vermont and
about 200,000 gallons of syrup. The Ver
mont supply is considered the standard,
both in quality and quantity, all over tha
United States. "We shall be lucky this
season If we get 200.000 pounds of sugar
and 150,000 gallons of syrup from that
State.
"Ohio used to come next as a reliable
source of staple supply. But shipments
from there to New York have been
dwindling so fast for five years that they
have virtually ceased. So far as I can
find out New York will not get ten pounds
of sugar from Ohio this season.
i "New York State comts third. The
sugar we get from the Adirondack region
is particularly good, but the quantity pro
duced this year is very much below the
normal. Shipments from Pennsylvania
are good this year. Since the Siate For
estry Commission put a stop to the whole
sale destruction of woodland, maples in
the Keystone State have been yielding
syrup of fine quality and in fair quantity.
"Naturally, scarcity increases the price.
There is so little competition that com
mission men have to give what the farm
ers ask. Five years ago we could buy all
the maple sugar we wanted In New York
at from 5 to 6 cents a pound by the
carload and syrup at 53 cents a gallon.
This year we have to pay from 10 to 13
cents a pound for sugar by the carload
and from 75 cents to $1 a gallon for maple
syrup. A cold and rainy summer is re
sponsible for it.
"Adulteration? Of course there la, lots
of it. Very little of the alleged maple
sugar sold In groceries and on candy
stands contains 20 per cent of maple. It
is not so easy to adulterate syrup, but a
great deal of it is done."

The forest conditions of the islands
are unlike any that prevail in this
country. William L. Hall of the Bu
reau of Forestry, who has Just returned
from a two months' examination of
the islands, reports peculiar and inter
esting problems which forestry must
Bolve there. The islands contain
scarcely any forest capable of yielding
timber of value for lumber. Nearly all
the lumber used for building purposes
comes Jrom the Pacific Coast. But
there are several hundred thousand
acres of forest land of the greatest
value for protective purposes. Indeed,
bo great is the importance of these for
ests that on their preservation depends
the existence of the sugar industry and
that Is equivalent to saying the con
tinued prosperity of the islands. The
sugar exports of the last fiscal year
amounted to $25,000,000, and sugar is
practically the only export. The rais
ing of sugar requires an enormous
amount of water, nearly all of which
must be supplied by irrigation, the wa
ter being carried in flumes and ditches
from the wet, mountainous parts of the
Islands to the dry plains on which the
sugar cane is grown. The rainfall of
the Islands is nearly all confined to the
northeast and east mountain slopes,
â¢where it is tremendously heavy, some
years more than 200 inches. On the
other Bide of the divide, and in the
plains beyond, where the sugar cane
grown., there may be no more than fif
teen inches of rain a year.
The Territorial Government of the
Hawaiian Islands will appoint as su
perintendent of forestry this winter a
man furnished it by the Bureau of For
estry, who will take charge of import
ant projects for the betterment of the
islands' forests. The man appointed
will have the responsibilities of deter
mining the location and the boundaries
of a system of forest reserves, and lat
er of superintending a great deal of
forest planting, both on public and pri
\-ate lands.
(From report of rr.U*d Ftatr>Â» Bureau of For
estry, date of November 3.)
The importance of finding a satisfac
tory substitute for spruce for the
manufacture of paper pulp led to a
commercial studv of the balsam fir,
which Ranhae! G. Zon of the Bu
reau of Forestry has Just concluded.
The rapid disappearance of spruce,
the best tree in the north woods for
the manufacture of pulp, has forced
pulp makers to use more and more
balsam, and has brought that tree, once
despised and neglected, into a very im
portant place. Four years ago prac
tically no balsam was used by pulp
manufacturers, many of whom are now
using from 25 to 50 per cent of it. The
amount of balsam used depends entire
ly on the spruce supply near where the
different mills are located. The smaller
the amount of cpruce available the
greater is the amount of balsam used.
Pulp manufacturers find balsam the
best substitute for spruce which can
be found in the north woods. Other
trees there are which might serve well
for paper pulp, but they are not native
to the country where the mills are lo
cated. Pulp mills are enormously
heavy and expensive, and the wood
must be brought to themâ they cannot
be takon to the wood. The pulp man,
therefore, in hs choice of a substitute
for his diminishing supply of spruce,
is confined to the very few species that
grow In association with spruce, and of
the.Â«e species balsam is at once the
most abundant and the most promis
ing.
The present method of making pulp
out of balsam is to grind it or treat It
with chemicals along with spruce. The
results are not satisfactory. Balsam
mixed with spruce produces an inferior
grade of pulp. Mr. Zon suggests that it
would be much better if balsam were
handled independently of spruce. The
balsam fibers are not nearly so tough
and strong as those of spruce, and the
pressure of the grinders, which are ad
justed for spruce fibers, is too powerful
for the fibers of balsam and they are
torn and weakened. For the same rea
son the chemicals used in the treatment
of spruce fibers weaken and dissolve
the fibers of balsam when used in the
same strength. Examples of what can
be done with balsam in the manufac
ture of- paper are found in France,
where the tree is made to produce good
book papers. There not only the main
trunk but even the top of the tree is
used. \ . ,
The silvicultural features of the bal
sam are related by Mr. Zon. who has
studied the tree carefully throughout
its range, but particularly in Maine
end the Adirondacks. Spruce has been
cut. for many years, while balsam has
scarcely been cut at all; hence balsam
has taken the place of and is crowding
out the spruce. This change In species
in the north woods is hastened by the
great superiority of balsam as a seed
tree, for balsam bears seeds every
year, while the spruce seeds only once
In seven years. These conditions make
it apparent how very desirable it is
that pulp manufacturers should use
balsam wherever possible, for in doing
po they not only lessen the drain on the
limited amount of spruce left, but they
give the tree a chance to grow and re
produce itself. This point Mr. Zon
brings out forcefully.
The results of Mr. Zon's work will
appear this winter in the form of a
bulletin published by the Bureau of
Forestry-

GENERAL recession continues all along the commer
cial line and includes merchandise, grains, industrial
branches and the 'stock market. Here and there
some improvement and even expansion is noted, but as a rule
trade is subsiding both in volume of'transactions and in
values. This is reflected by the country's bank clearings;
which showed a loss last week of 30.8 per cent from the cor
responding week in 1902, with most of the dozeVi great cities
on the wrong side of the exhibit, New York leading with a
decrease of 28 per cent. But the volume of clearings is keep
ing up remarkably well, exceeding $2,000,000,000, over half of
which is credited to New York. Still the general aspect is
one of apathy and unwillingness on, the part of the controll
ing interests to sustain prices. Thus the great packing con
cerns of the West decline to support their provision mar
kets, or at best their support is ianguid; the powerful finan
cial interests of New York are contemplating the steady re
cession in stocks with comparative indifference, contenting
themselves with reiterating that stocks are too low and that
they can now be safely purchased for investment; the im
mense iron and steel mills, no longer overwhelmed with rush
orders, calmly close down or greatly restrict their output,
while the speculating public cannot be induced to plunge
either in railroad stocks in Wall street or in grain and pro
vision futures at Chicago. There is no apprehension any
where to amount to anything, nor any indication of a spasm;
the feeling seems to be one of apathy, as if the whole mer
cantile and financial country regarded the current lull as
something long anticipated, "more or less discounted and
quite the proper thing under the circumstances, and it prob
ably is.
The fact is we are now experiencing what everybody has
been expecting for a year or two and it has been pretty well
discounted. It does not come like a thunderbolt from the
blue sky like the panic of 1893, and therefore exhibits no sin
ister features. We all knew that the boom could not last
forever and that quieter times would surely ensue, and those
quieter times have come. : â¢
Considering the staples individually we have a much
slower iron and steel market, with diminished production
and consumption and lower quotations; a weak and irregu
lar provision market, with increasing supplies of hogs and
declining prices; a wool situation characterized by heavy
and accumulating stocks and easy quotations; a weak and
slack hide and leather market, with plenty of supplies on
hand; a nervous cotton market, which is fluctuating fever
ishly according to the tenor of the crop reports, and sluggish
grain markets, due largely to the fine crop prospects
throughout the world and the statements from England and
the continent that they can get along without calling on
America for any very large quantity of wheat. This asser
tion is thus far affirmed by the fact that our exports for the
crop year to date are about 40,000,000 bushels less than .dur
ing the corresponding period in 1902.
But while the wheat exports show this deficiency the
general exports of the country are not making a bad exhibit
and have lately shown some expansion, the exports of the
leading products aggregating the second largest total ever
recorded in October. Still it must not be overlooked that
stocks of almost all lines are increasing with such steadiness
that cautious business men are looking forward to still lower
prices in the future. Cotton, as mentioned a week ago, is an
exception, as the South is marketing an enormous quantity
and. at excellent prices.
The situation in the Western coal fields is better than a
week ago, though still disturbed and uncertain. Labor
troubles are reported in different parts of the country and
predictions that wages must conform to the lower conditions
by declining in sympathy are being met by the labor leaders
with the assertion that labor will not consent to any reduc
tion in wages. This attitude, does not look very favorable
for peaceful labor conditions in the near future, which of
course is producing an unfavorable effect upon business.
In considering the business situation as outlined above it
will be seen that we are at last- apparently on the ebb tide
and drifting toward a lower plane of values all along the
line. Profusion^ of money will give way to profusion of
supplies, shrinkage of profits and less demand for labor, and
while there is nothing in the outlook to cause alarm there
is sufficient to lead the careful to keep their financial fences
in repair and conduct their business with discretion. In this
connection it may not be amiss to note that the failures
throughout the country last week, while not large or*espe
cially prominent, numbered 283, against 241 for the corre j
sponding week in 1002. .^

In his capacity as Judge to determine
upon the sanity of a great big husky
lumberman from the northern part of
Sonoma County. The relatives of the
man seemed very anxious to bave him
committed, and their anxiety aroused
the Judge's suspicions. He made up
his mind, after learning the man had
a little property, that they were try
ing to railroad him. This opinion was
strengthened after he had conversed
with the lumberman for about an
hour. The fellow was well read,
and talked fo rationally on a half dozen
different subjects that Temple, when
he left him. determined to take steps
to punish the relatives.
He even went so far as to tell them
that he would take Judicial notice of
their conduct. They protested that the
man was insane, but Temple would not
listen to them. He waxed angry and
threatened to arrest them then and
there. Just as he told them so, a mes
sage came from the alleged insane one,
requesting a short interview with the
Judge.
You may be sure the request was
readily granted and in less than ten
minutes the Judge was in the presence
of the lumberman.
"Well, my man," said the Judge,
"what can I do for you?"
"Nothing much," was the response,
"only for God's sake take that bell off

The annual consumption of firewood
at Mohegan Park from now on will
amount to about- 150 cords a year.
Heretofore the forest has been cut clear
to obtain firewood, so that the cutting
has been a menace to the appearance of
the park. Mr. Zon will change all this
by using for fuel trees whose presence
mars the beauty of the woods, thus
making the cutting a benefit instead of
a source of harm to the forest. Simple
rules are given in the report for the
selection of trees for removal, how to
get the timber out, the area which must
be cut over every year to obtain the re
quired amount of firewood, etc. The re
port concludes with a list of the trees
and shrubs found in the park.
Owners of private estates in the Adi
rondacks may profit by a report made
recently by Raphael G. Zon, of the Bu
reau of Forestry, concerning the man
agement of Mohegan Park. In township
5, Hamilton County, N. Y.. owned by
J. Pierpont Morgan. Mr. Zon re
cently made an examinaton of the for
ests at Mohegan Park, in response to
Mrs. Morgan's request to the bureau for
advice, and has outlined a simple plan
for their management which has been
accepted and ordered put immediately
into practice. Mr. Zon's plan of man
agement so well fits the special desires
of other private owners in the Adiron
dacks that it is apt to have a far wider
application than to Mohegan Park.
Mohegan Park comprises l.ir>0 acres,
of which 1410% acres are in forest. The
forest has never been lumbered, al
though it has furnished much wood for
building and heating the camps. The
trees are mainly hardwoods, most of
which are past maturity, and would,
under a system of forestry for the high
est commercial returns, be removed
gradually or at once and replaced by
a thriftier crop. The owner, however,
desires that the beautful old trees be
allowed to stand, so the system of for
estry practiced will consist mainly in
the removal of dead, dying, unsound,
crooked and other unsightly trees, to
gether with those trees which are im
peding the growth of others more val
uable and beautiful than themselves. In
other words, the kind of forestry prac
ticed in the park will be one shaped and
adapted to the peculiar desires of the
owner. It Is a kind that appeals very
strongly to many owners of small pri
vate estates in the Adirondacks whose
interest in forestry lies not so much in
the money returns to be obtained as in
the improvement in appearance of their
forests.
The Hawaiian public lands consist of
1,772.640 acres. All of these lands,
which are in forest, and many forest
areas privately owned which the Gov
ernment can gain possession of by ex
change, will be put into forest reserves,
cleared of cattle and goats, fenced and
preserved. Some compensation must
also be made for the great areas of for
est already destroyed. It will be part of
the work of the forester to plant to
valuable trees large areas of this de
nuded land upon which forests are of
most vital importance to the agricul
tural interests. Mr. Hall, who carefully
examined the climatic conditions, be
lieves that species of the Pacific Coast,
such as redwood and red flr, will do
well in most places at the higher eleva
tions on the islands. An example of
how a foreign species may succeed in
Hawaii is furnished by the mesquite
of our own Southwest, which was intro
duced into the Islands some fifty years
ago and now covers about 100,000 acres,
furnishing quantities of valuable fuel.
It is not called mesquite in Hawaii,
however, but goes by the name of al
garoba.
too rapidly into the sea.' The presence
of the forest cover, since It makes the
stream flow regular, preventing both
floods and periods of low stream flow,
is indispensable to the success of Irri
gating projects. The value of this for
est, strangely enough, consists not so
much In the trees it containsâ for they
are frequently low, crooked and sparse
ly scattered â as In the impenetrable
mass of undergrowth beneath them.
This undergrowth, composed of vines,
ferns and mosses, is of so dense a char
acter that it shades the ground, abso
lutely and holds water like a sponge.
It is, however, exceedingly delicate and
easily destroyed. Let cattle into such a
forest and they will speedily trample*
or eat down the undergrowth till the
bare ground is exposed. The soil then
rapidly dries out and becomes hard and
the trees soon die. Grasses, insects and
wind usually hasten the" destruction.
Cattle and goats have ravaged the Ha
waiian forests without hindrance for
many years and have worked further
each year into the heart of the dense
tropical growth.

and satisfactory drinking water from the river without puri
fying it, even if all sewage could be kept out of the stream
from above the city. It is equally clear, it says, that the
small number of consumers of river water below Sacramento
would likewise need to purify their water. To purify the
sewage of Sacramento would be very expensive and would
make necessary a double system of sewers, while "the re
sults to the people would be practically valueless." The
Bee thereupon urges the State Board of Health to rescind
its order concerning the turning of unpurified sewage into
the Sacramento River.

The citrus fruit of California is being
handled on an entirely new plan this sea
son. All the fruit passes through the Cal
ifornia Fruit Agency, which is made up
of the Southern California Fruit Ex
change and the Citrus Union.
The Southern California Fruit Exchange
Is composed of the growers who formerly
shipped their fruit direct to the markets
and did not do business through the
packing-houses. The Citrus Union Is
composed of the packing-houses which
contract for oranges from growers not
.belonging to the Southern California
Fruit Exchange.
Both associations, however, have to do
their business through the new Califor
nia Fruit Agency, thus doing away with
the former ruinous competition. By this
means the markets are not glutted, and
we hope to get good prices this year, to
the benefit of every one concerned.
METHOD OF HANDLING.
Our crop this year will sell for nearly
$1,000,000 in the Eastern markets. Of this
sum $360,000 will be paid for freight,
which Is a heavy tax on the growers.
After- paying expenses of marketing, sal
aries to Eastern agents and operating ex
penses of the orchards, the growers will
get from 10 to 30 per cent net profit on
their investments.
This proves that The Call is taking
great interest in the central section of
California. All credit for citrus culture
is not .given to Southern California.
There axe abundant opportunities in
Tulare County for citrus culture. We
have no frosts until after the oranges are
snipped, and then not sufficient to dam
age the trees. We have no scale, and the
growers are not put to the expense of
fumigation of trees and washing of fruit.
We ship our fruit just as it comes from
the trees.
I was delighted to read an editorial in
The Call of tnis morning, which comment
ed on the fact that the first shipment of
oranges this season from California came
from Tulare County.
Citrus land in Tulare County of course
requires irrigation, but we have an abun
dant supply of water that only needs
tapping. Large sums of money are now
being invested in sinking wells in our
section.
HAVE PLENTY OF WATER.
This year the crop of citrus fruits from
our county will amount to 120U carloads,
and the industry is yet in its infancy. We
have about 6ow acres of land in citrus
fruits. The orange belt extends from
Exeter to Lindsay, along the Sierra foot
hills thence to Porterville and back east
to the Worth, Globe and South Tule dis
tricts, also to Lemon Cove and Antelope
Heights.
There are several thousand acres of
good land available for citrus fruit cul
ture in Tulare County. Ours possesses
many advantages over the Southern Cal
ifornia citrus lands. Our fruits are ready
for the Eastern markets five weeks be
fore those of the southern counties. Our
lands can be bought for from $50 to $150
per acre, while in Southern California
land is priced at 5150 to $400 and more per
acre.
The growth of the citrus industry is
shown by comparing the shipments ol
fruit at the present time ana those of
some years ago. I was manager of the
first Porterviiie Citrus Fruit Kxchange,
ten years ago, and we were happy wnen
â¢we shipped twenty-four carloads of Iruit
to the Kastern markets.
The citrus industry In Tulare County
commenced about fifteen years ago In a
email way. A few oranges had been
raised, and Professor Hilgard of the
State Agricultural Department showed by
analysis that the oranges from Tulare
County were superior to the fruit from
Southern California. This report caused
the citrus industry to boom In our sec
tion and large sums of money were in
vested.
COJOIENCED IN SMAXL WAY.
Up to a few years ago It was gener
alyl thought that Southern California was
the only section of the State that could
successively raise citrus fruits.
Tulare is now the third county In Cali
fornia in the size and acreage of oranges.
The competitions at the Midwinter Fair
In San Francisco, at various State fairs
and in Los Angeles have shown that Tu
lare County can raise the best of or
anges Our growers have taken many
prizes in these competitions, beating the
entries from the southern portion of the
State.

reliable sources in regard to the 'ad
vancement of all localities and all in
dustries in this great State. There is
no new undertaking of public interest,
however small, that may not be sup
posed, in the light of the past history of
California, to possess the germ of much
larger things than appear at first.
No harm will be done in this connec
tion to remind the readers of The Call
that every enterprise In this State, with
perhaps the exception of placer mining,
has been begun on a comparatively
small scale and really tentatively in a
majority of instances. Fruit growing
was experimental at the first, except in
so much as it applied to the home con
sumption in this State and the mining
country Immediately adjoining Califor
nia. The experimental use of oil as
fuel at first was attended with disas
trous consequences. Â¦ Gold dredging/hy
draulic mining and quartz mining had
small beginnings relatively. The na
tive wealth of the State has caused ex
pansion that no one could prevent:
Nothing will ever fetter the growth of
the State again, for It Is becoming bet
ter known and better appreciated every
flay.
It is realized that to supply an accu
rate view of many facts in. many com
munities in California the editors of the
interior papers can perform a good pub
lic service by exploiting local resources,
reliably and fully. 5 The Call will assist
in making locality facts known as much
as possible. The aid of boards of trade
and chambers of commerce, of organ
izations cf shippers of fruits and grapes
and wines and all other California prod
ucts Is hoped for .by The Call, and such
assistance will be welcomed and en
couraged. To the California miners the
same assurance is given. The Call will
help in upbuilding the entire Pacific
Coast, but must necessarily give par
ticular attention to California.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Nov. 15.â Peter Al

on 'Adams street, was drowned In a
small wine tank this morning. The man
conducted a winery in the rear of his
hotel, and had put about 100 gallons oT
water in the tank with which to cleanse
it. He entered the tank without" pull-'

As soon as his head was in the man
hole he was overcome by the fumes.
He fell Into the tank and was drowned.
The cook at the hotel was with Al

ond year of its operation. The sand is
carried to Stockton from Tesla. The
fuel used is California crude petroleum.
The water distance from Stockton to
San Francisco is 85 miles. The rail
rates are kept down by- water competi
tion. The claim is made that the low
est freight rates for an equal distance
in the United States by water exist be
tween Stockton and San Francisco.
The county boasts three Irrigation
systems by which water is distributed
to farming lands. A good showing is
made for the banks of Stockton. Their
paid up capital is $1,708,560. Their de
posits amount to $5,446,181.
"Stockton banks," says the Independ
ent, "are among the safest institutions
in the United States. There has never
been a bank failure In Stockton. The
loans they have on lands were all made
at low valuations of the properties and
in every instance such values have
greatly increased. All lands, not only
in this county, but throughout the San
Joaquin Valley, have shown a stronger
increase in value during the last two
years, and their tendency is upward."
INVITING ENTERPRISES.
The flouring mills of Stockton are re
ported to have a daily capacity for
turning out 3500 barrels. The iron man
ufactures are large. San Joaquln Coun
ty ranks i seventh in Importance in
manufactures among the fifty-seven
counties of California. The number of
manufacturing 1 plants In the county, In
cluding Stockton, according to the
United States census of 1900, was 352.
The invested capital in these plants
amounts to more than $5,000,000. The
annual output of all the plants is near
ly $8,000,000. New industries that
might be made profitable in Stockton
are suggested by the Independent aa
follows:
A starch factory to work up the sur
plus potatoes and the culls which are
not put on the market; a jam or preserv
ing works for utilizing the surplus fruit
from about the Lodi country; a pickle
factory; a butchery and pork and beef
packing establishment. Of this latter
there is a great need even to meet the
local demand for fresh and refrigerated
meats. A sugar refinery Is demanded
to work up the sugar beet product and
encourage the planting of more acreage.
Sash and door factories are greatly need
ed, as none of the kind are yet located
here on any scale of importance. Chem
ical works, broom factories and cracker
factories would do well, as there are
none here; a silk mill would be a great
success apparently, eren if the growing
of raw silk were promoted: but aside
from that the neAtness to China and the
low freight rates gives the California
producer of this; commodity an import
ant advantage over Eastern competitors.
A carpet mills and furniture manufac
tory would both apparently do well.
Power can be generated from oil at small
cost, for oil in California now can com
pete with coal at $3 per ton. and natural
gas of great heat power is here. There
is as jarreat abundance of labor here as
there is in any city in California, and
any scarcity of that service can be sup
plied at once from the nearest place
where there is a surplus.
The birth rate in Berlin declined from

RAILROAD CONSTRUCTION.
The; salmon fisheries of Klamath
River have been a source of much
wealth, although the Industry has not
been prosecuted with the same system
as in other localities. In quality Kla
math River salmon are superior to
those taken in streams , farther south;
and the great river offers an open field
and enterprse to whoever desires to
venture.
Humboldt acquired this territory
through an act of the Legislature of
1873-74, which blotted Klamath County
from the State map. Indian troubles
during the first fifteen years of settle r
ment and the tedious and expensive
modes of transportation in vogue did
much toward retarding the develop
ment and growth of northern Hum
bc-ldt. I venture the opinion that the
Influx of new life and moderate capital
at this time would go far toward mak
ing good what ha3 been lost., I further
venture the belief that if a portion of
the lavish -expenditure of money for
road building in southern and south
western Humboldt more than a quarter
of a century ago had been devoted ,to
the building and betterment of trans
portation facilities in the region just
discussed, quicker and better returns
would have resulted.
On this point there is no difference of
opinion among those who have lived in
the county during the period indicated.
There is no consistent difference of be
lief as to the existence of a great store
of hidden wealth in the north extremity
of Humboldt territory-
Much mining is done along Trinity
River in Humboldt territory; vastly
more along the Klamath between
Witchpec and Orleans Bar, and on the
Sommes Bar and the junction of Sal
mon River with the Klamath at the
Siskiyou line. More important devel
opment work has been done at and in
the vicinity of Orleans Bar because of
the introduction of foreign capital for
actual development. The region is rich
in both gravel and quartz deposits. The
opinion that mining will be more exten
sively prosecuted along the Klamath
twenty-five years hence than it is at
the present time Is strongly held by
miners of long practical experience.
The beach sand mines along the
northern Humboldt coast, particularly^
at Gold Bluff, have been worked half a
century, usually with profit. Entangle
ment In the meshes of the law during
recent years has brought unprofitable
results. Nevertheless, the gold is, in
the sands, and sooner or later it will be
marketed.. . ' .-. .\\ '-:Â¦/, ; 'Â¦:'â¢
From a casual study of the State map
the writer is led to believe that no
other county in California is as liberal
ly watered by main and tributary
streams as Humboldt.
Between the redwood belt and Kla
math River is a vast expanse of bald
hills or grazing lands, including some
of the most productive though not larg
est stock ranges in the county. The
entire stretch of country north of Kla
math River and east of It to the-Siski
you line may be set down as mineral
land, which in the main yet remains
undisturbed.
The Hoopa Valley Indian reservation,
twelve square miles in extent. Is in the
southeast part of this divlson. Trinity
River passes through the center of the
reservation, with Tish-Tang-a-Tang
and Mill creeks flowing into it from the
east and Supply and Pine creeks Ji<jm
the west.
IS LIBERALLY WATERED.
As segregated, the third division com
mences at the south line of Trinidad,
Klamath and Orleans townships, mid
way between the township lines of six
and seven north, and includes territory
fifty miles in extent on the shore line
and forty miles therefrom to the Siski
you County boundary on the east. It is,
perhaps, a division of equal importance
with either of the- others, containing
as it does the chief mineral resources
of the county thus far ascertained, pe
troleum and coal excepted. The writer
is informed that nattering "oil signs"
have been discovered in some sections
of Northern Humboldt, a possibility not
beyond the bounds of belief. The coast
portion, for an average of ten miles in
land and almost entirely throughout its
north and south length, shows one of
the finest bodies tof redwood timber,
comparatively undisturbed, now stand
ing in the only State or country in
which that class of. material is known
to exist. To this, as merchantable, may
be added to a certain extent the ex
tensive growth of pine and tanbark, oak
and a vast acreage of such fuel woods
as fir, spruce, madrone, alder and other
varieties for which the lapse of time
will create a certain demand.

creeks are prominent streams in the
western portion of this division. Red
wood Creek passes through fully one
half of it, diagonally; Trinity River
through the southeast portion of it to
a junction with the Klamath River in
side the Hoopa Valley reservation; the
Klamath through the entire northern
portion from the Siskiyou lin-? to the
ocean. Salmon River and Red Cap
Creek are principal tributaries of the
Klamath on the east and Camp, Bluff,
Pecwan and Blue creeks on the west,
the source of the latter being in the
Del Norte Mountains, fifteen miles from
Its mouth.
So far as the search for minerals in
the eastern and northeastern portion*
of this division of the county is con
cerned, the surface has been merely
"scratched over," to use - a mining
phrase. Gold and copper ledges have
been located in the district above told
of and limestone abounds in the re
gion roundabout.
South Fork Mountain throughout its
entire length is covered with a heavy
growth of sugar pine timber, and
many thousand inches of the yet pure
water of the stream have been located
for power purposes, but are yet un
used. /
As the timber disappears on the west
and east extremes of this division and
the large stock ranges are broken into
small holdings, there will be scores of
homes where there are very few now.
The advance of railroads from the two
directions indicate that the change may
come sooner than many expect. Denu
dation of the redwood lands will pro
ceed much faster in this central portion
than in either of the others because
the spoliation commenced a third of a
century sooner and a sea shipping
point is close at hand.
When the pierhead lines in Hum
boldt Bay shall have been established
for all time, the channels are properly
guarded, encroachments defied, and Eu
reka has become the virtual terminus
of a transcontinental railroad, her lim
its must necessarily- expand, for at an
even more rapid rate than it has been
removed two centuries or more will
be reaulred to wipe away the redwood
timber now standing in the county. It
is safe to guess that the greater pro
portion of the manufactured, lumber
will take advantage of the , cheaper
transportation afforded by the ocean
which leaves Humboldt's shore.

SPLEHDID FUTURE ASSURED,
One promise of great moment to this
northern division of Humboldt County
must not be overlooked. It is the cer
tainty of a close coming State high
way from Weaverville, the county seat
of Trinity County, to Humboldt Bay,
a distance of about 120 miles; or, rath
er, the supplying of a missing central
link of road about fifty miles in ex
tent to connect already completed sec
tions at either end. At the last session
of the Legislature Assemblyman Lein
inger secured the passage of a bill ap
propriating $1800 for the survey of a
route for such road from the north
fork of Trinity River, following the
meanderings of the last named stream
to the south fork of Trinity River at
the Humboldt line. That survey will
be completed prior to the next session
of the, Legislature, during which an ap
propriation will certainly be made to
complete the road. In fact, this out
come is assured. Strange as it may
seem, after fifty years of continuous
business intercourse, the mountain
trail is still the only means of com
munloation between the two counties.
Completion of the road will be a won
derful promoter of the real interests of
both counties. It will open an outlet
from cheap sea transportation into a
region 100 miles in length where the de
mand for mining machinery is increas
ing every year and along which snow
never falls to a troublesome depth, as
it does on any other route that has
been suggested. It will mark the
dawning of a new era for Trinity
County.
neglected locations which are waiting
for occupants throughout Humboldt's
hundred miles of length. With the in
auguration of better facilities for
reaching a ready market the outlying
districts will multiply! in population
and there will be fewer neglected home
locations than there are to-day.
Why? Because everywhere the soil
is productive, the climate genial and
healthful and grain, vegetable, berry
and tree fruit crops mature with min
imum encouragement. The average
rainfall during the six months of wet
season is forty-six inches, yet during
these months the rainfall is by no
means continuous, many weeks of the
winter season being as pleasant as the
summer affords. And let it be remem
bered that Humboldt has" no Chinese
to compete with American labor, no ir
rigation, with its expense and litiga
tion; no codlln moths to destroy the
apples, and no crop failures from any
cause. . /

SACRAMENTO, Nov. 15.â In the
tenth inning of to-day's game, with the
score tied, the Senators developed a
preat batting rally which, aided by a
bad throw on the part of Devereaux,
allowed five runs to score. Keefe
pitched a great game and had it not
been for a slip of Doyle on a hard
thance, he would have shut the visitors
out with only two safe hits. As it was
he shut them out for eight of the ten
innings without a hit or a run. Score:

LOS AXGELES, Nov. 15.â Mr. Jones
of Brooklyn was opposed to Dr. New
ton of Los Angeles this afternoon. The
home pitcher won his game by the
score of 5 to L There was no choice
between the pitchers. Jones did quite
as well as Newton, but there was a
{Treat difference between the fielding of
the Portland and the Los Angeles
teams. Jones drove in the only run
ecored by Portland with a neat single
over short. Shea started in to catch
Jones, but one of the Brooklyn lad's
outshoots caught him on the fingers
and put him out of the game. Clark,
who succeeded him behind the bat, was
responsible for two runs because of his
poor throwing to second. One of the
biggest crowds of the season turned out
to see Jones and Newton work. At

WILLIE HAACK, a clever
lightweight jockey, who is
here from the East with his
father, was not seen in the
George Gardner is rounding into form
for his battle with Fitzsimmons. He
worked out before a big crowd yester
daV. and the wise ones came away with
a high opinion of the Lowell boxer.
George hammered theMnflated sphere
for ten minutes without a let-up and
then took on Harry Foley and Alec
Greggains in eight two-minute rounds.
Foley did the fast boxing and let loose
all his pet punches at George. The lat
ter blocked beautifully and hammered
Foley until Harry thought Dave Barry
was throwing rocks at him. Greggains
wore a heavy pneumatic pad and al
lowed Gardner to land with all his
force. Gardner took some hot punches
in return, a3 Greggain3 was there with
both hands. Gardner lifted Greggains
off his feet time and time again with
terrific punches which the recipient
could feel through the pad. It was
great work for Gardner and did much
to perfect his punching powers. Gard
ner worked for half an hour.
should not be 1 to 1. Canole
is a much better man than Selger,
and although Britt Is picked to win,
the Californian will have his work cut
out for him to achieve a victory.
Canole has not, apparently, extended
himself in training. He has a number
of Eastern sporting men with him who
are here to take as much coin home
with^them as possible. The odds suit
them and they will bank heavily on
Canole's chances of winning. , .
Canole is a big surprise when he doffs
his garments. His legs are big and
strong and his stomach is. ridged with
muscles that will save him in a de
gree from BrltCs punishing lefts.
Landers, who is training for Mauro
Herrera, landed a right on Canole a
few days ago and sent the Easterner
staggering against the wall. The Bos
ton boy came back and fought his spar
ring partner to a standstill. Canole has
a stiff left which he lands with unerr
ing aim. In boxing before' a big crowd
yesterday Canole refrained from using
his right hand. He devoted his atten
tion to straight Jabs and upper-cuts
with hisleft. Canole uses a shift which
Britt will have to solve before the fight
progresses far, as Canole is clever in
landing with it.
Alec Greggains, Harry Foley and the
balance of the men quartered at Lark
spur look upon Canole as a good man.
They also admit that Canole does not
extend himself in training. It remains
to be seen how much better he can do
in the ring.

ALAMEDA, Nov. 15. â Snappy and
scientific football was played by the
Vampires and the Hornets of the Cali
fornia Association League on the TVeb
ster-street field this afternoon, result
ing in a hard-earned victory for the
former kickers by a score of 1 to 0.
The goal that won the game
was made in the first part of the sec
ond half. In this half the sphere was
for the greater part of the time in the
Vampires' territory. It appeared sever
al times that the Hornets, who grew
aggressive toward the close, would tie
the contest. Bird, Williamson, Erskine
and Chambers of the Hornets "put up a
game that surprised their opponents,
and won many commendations for the
punters. Peterson and Wilding, of the
Vampires, were the men who attracted
the attention of the large crowd by
splendid work for their side. The
teams lined up as follows:
Hornets â Williamson, goal; Shand,
right back; W. Pomroy, left back;
Bird, right half; Chambers, center half;
McKay, left half; Lackie, outside right;
Cowell, inside right; Erskine, center; E.

The Independents put the ball be
tween the posts a second* time before
half time was called, but did not score
a goal.
After changing ends the Independents
worked the ball down close to the Pick
wick poal and Rushton, running out to
save, left his post unguarded. The In
dependents secured a second goal. A
little later another goal was secured by
a good shot at an acute angle. Though
the Pickwicks worked hard and had
several shots at the goal, none of them
resulted successfully and the match
ended without their scorins- C. ' W.

The heavy rain which fell on Satur
day had rendered the ground muddy, so
that the players slipped repeatedly on
Its treacherous surface.
The Independent Association Football
eleven easily defeated the Pickwick
team yesterday afternoon on the Pre
sidio athletic grounds in this city.
the conclusion of play the score stood
6 to 0 in favor of the Independents.
The number of goals scored by the
winners would have been considerably
larger had the losers not possessed an
excellent goalkeeper, Rushtcn, who
made many fine saves. The Pickwick
efeven was largely made up of new
men and lacked team work. The com
bination work and passing of the In
dependents were much superior to those
of their opponents and the Pickwick
goal was constantly in danger.
The ball was kicked off at 2:40 p. m.
by Taliesin Evans, president of the Cal
ifornia Association Football League.
After a good deal of back and forth
play two dangerous shots at the Pick
wick goal being cleverly kept out by
Rushton, the Independents took the
ball down the field with a rush and
I scored the first goal in about fifteen
I minutes.
Besides all the other pleasant things
that happened, the spectators had the
opportunity of looking on a game
which savored of genuine baseball
from the tap of the gong. First it was
San Francisco's game, then the score
was tied, after which the natives pull
ed up again, another deadlock resulted
and finally the northern stars beat
out Uncles followers.
Jay Hughes was given the glad hand
of welcome as he stepped into the box
to perform for the last time this year
against the bunch controlled by Uncle.
Jay was not as good as he might be
and the youngster Cutter, who mixed
'em up for Uncle, really had the big
league veteran beaten a city block
throughout.
Xot a run showed till the fifth, when
Cutter slashed one to right . field for
two bases. Shay maneuvered about
the plate for a while and finally slam
med down a bunt that he beat to first,
starting the crowd yelling. Meany
lined one at Dolan and Shay was re
tired at second and Meany at first.
Cutter sprinted for the pan and scored
while the double was being pulled off.
Seattle was right behind the home
puard with a run in their half of the
Fixth. Mohler drew a pass. Smith sin
gled, as did Brashear. and the kid
scampered in. Then the locals forged
ahead once more. Krug was passed
and kyneh came through with a bunt
that got past both Hughes and Moh
ler. sendinp the German to third. Del
mas popped up a little fly back of sec
ond and Mohler could not recover in
time for a throw to the plate, so Krug
arrived with the last run for his team.
Not till the seventh round did the
club swingers from the north strike
thpir gait. A little good base running,
aided by a few free passes, allowed
Dolan and Mohler to make the loop,
giving Seattle the game by just one
run. The score:

pion of Watsonville, was somewhat out
of condition and was taken into camp
by George Janes.
Some of the best matches resulted ai
follows: .
An interesting practice match was
played in the morning. The contest
ants were Frank Mitchell and Drum
mond-MacGavin on one side of the net
and Joseph S. Tobln and Will Taylor
on the other. Tobin and Taylor, who
were champions ten years ago, were
not figured to have a chance against
the cracks of the present day. The old
timers surprised everybody by win
ning two sets out of three. MacGavin
had one of his wild days and his er
rors and the steadiness of his oppo
nents are .accountable for their victo
ry. Taylor was fast and accurate at
the net, while Tobin did brilliant work
in the back court. The score was 6-4,
2-6. 6-4.
MacGavin was at his best a little
later in a singles match with Mitchell.
The latter has been playing a strong
game of late, but his younger oppo
nent beat him with ease, winning three
straight sets.
Ray Cornell and Professor Crawford
played the longest set of the day. The
score was 16-14 with the profejssor on
the long end.
Some of the matches played resulted
as follows:
The final match of the handicap dou
bles tennis tournament played on the
California Club courts yesterday after
noon resulted in an easy victory for
Grant and Chester Smith. They allow
ed Herbert Schmidt "and Harry Rolfe
odds of "owe 4-6" and won three
straight sets. The easy way in which
Schmidt and. Rolfe disposed of Mitch
ell and MacGavin last Sunday made
their chances look good.
The first set was the only one of the
three that was at all close. In this,
first one side was ahead and then the
other and nearly all the games were
deuce vantage. Y/oung Schmidt played
a spectacular game at the start, but
the steady and accurate lobbing of the
Smith brothers proved too much for
their younger opponents. The second
set was extremely one-sided. Smith
and Smith led at 6-0 and 30-0 and then
lost two games. The third and last
set at the start gave promise of being
close, but after 2-2 the Smith brothers
took four straight games. The score
was 6-4, 6-2, 6-2.
Most of the balls were played fo
Chester Smith and he handled them
cleverly. His; brother was not at his
best, his service being particularly
weak. Rolfe was too nervous- to play
his regular practice game, which is a
good one. The winners made few er
rors and undoubtedly won on superior
steadiness. They will hold the cup3
until the next handicap doubles tour
nament Is played, which will probably
be on Christinas day. This was the
second of a series of events for the
trophies, the first being won by Dr.
Hill and Will Allen.

Deciding course â P. J. Horgan's Tralee

(.same breeding).
Rubber Ankles, fresh from her
triumphs in the American Waterloo at
Oklahoma City, started in the open
stake yesterday at Union Coursing
Park and won cleverly. The fortunes
of coursing gave her three "bye"
courses, so she was called upon to beat
only Pepepf Hill, Tralee Boy and Van
dal. The long railroad Journey to Ok
lahoma did not dull her speed, as she
was at her best yesterday, showing a
great flight of speed.
The coursing was remarkable for the
length of the trials. Fifty of the
eighty-six courses lasted more than
one minute. Of this number nineteen
lasted more* than two minutes. Twenty
two favorites were beaten. Of these
four were one to five choices, while six
were one to three In the ring.
P. J. Horgan of Concord, who seems
to "have a monopoly of the "baby"
events," divided the puppy stakes with
Tralee Lass and Tralee Maid, two
promising- daughters* of Cronin's "Wild
Tralee. Each ran exactly 250 seconds up
to the deciding course. With the same
stock Mr. Horgan won the Futurity
and the Junior Champion. All the
Horgan youngsters run like seasoned
greyhounds, showing they have been
thoroughly tried on the up country
fields before making their debut here.
The results of yesterday's running with
Judge Andrew Dean's official scores

One of the most important military
matches that has taken place in the
State for a long time was held yester
day at the San Rafael military range.
The contesting companies were Battery
B, First Artillery Regiment, N.
G.- C, of San ' Francisco and Com
pany D, Fifth Infantry Regiment,
stationed at San Rafael. The match
was the first of a series of three
to be held by these companies. Battery
B was in charge of Captain W. S. Grat
tan, while Company D was taken care
of by Captain Newell Vanderbllt. Com
pany D proved the victors with 56S
points, against 563 for their opponents.
As the companies shot ten men each
the victors beat their contestants only
one-half a point per man. Company D
has long been known as one of the
best shooting companies in the Nation
al Guard, and Captain Grattan is to be
congratulated on getting up this series
of contests and bringing such a fine
team together. Battery B will next
shoot against the Alameda Company.

spent some hours watching the waves
as they dashed on the rocks. He wanted

gave the boy 25 cents on his promise
that he would stop playing. Another
man gave the boy a dime to begin play

The United States cruiser Minne

since the chip was laid up, during
meager and contradictory data found
in the reports of the Bureau of Con
struction and that of Steam Engineer
ing, The bureau first named gives the
displacement at 12.370 tons; horse
power. 15.5*0; speed, 18 knots. The Bu
reau of Steam Engineering gives the
displacement at 12,500 tons; horsepower.
35 640 B; speed. 18 knots. The discrep
ancies, while slight, leave In doubt
which of the figures are correct, and
as to the weight of machinery, there is
the choice between those of Assistant
Naval Constructor Powell of 1451 tons
and those of the Bureau of Steam En
gineering, which are 1599.03 tons.

The official speed trial of the battle
ship Maine took place August 23, 1902,
but up to the present time only meager
details have been published. It has
been the practice hitherto of the Bureau
of Steam Engineering to give in tabu
lated form the principal data of each
new vessel added to the navy, but the
recent report of the Engineer in Chief
f nils to give any such information about
â¢he Maine and the torpedo craft. It is
, nssible, however, that in the course of

43 men available for duty, namelj', 20
naval constructors end 23 assistant con
structors, of which latter three were
still at school. At the present time there
are 20 naval constructors and 27 assist
ants. As twelve of the latter are at
tending school, two of whom will not be
graduated until 1S04 and the other ten

Co, a reduction of eight in the course of
sixteen months. The law of Congress
providing for an increase to seventy
five In the constructors' corps within
the next six years appears to be inoper
ative, as thÂ° demand for regular line
officers for the navy is so urgent as to
make - any apportionment from the
graduates at Annapolis to the construc
tion corps impossible during three or
four years. The twelve young men de
signated as assistant naval constructors
will not be of much value to the service
for several years, as they have no prac
tical experience, and it Is not unlikely
that the Navy Department may find
itsejf compelled to adopt the recom
mendation cf Chief Constructor Hich
born. who suggested that graduates
from technological schools be admitted
to the constructors' corps. It is a case of
Hobson's choice, with the probability
of selection from civil life instead of
from the Naval Academy. The educa
tion of the latter institution is not in
dispensable to a designer and inspector
cf shlr>s.

The work of building a dockyard and
commercial harbor at Gibraltar is
making good progress, and will prob
ably be completed by 1909. One of the
three drvdocks will be ready for use
within a year. The several moves are
well advanced and already offer shelter
to shipping, as the entire Mediterranean
squadron recently found sufficient space
in the harbor and alongside the moles.
The plan was evolved in 1895, involving
an expenditure of $7,175,000, but subse
quent revisions have increased the esti
mates to approximately $30,000,000, of
which the colony of Gibraltar is to pay
about $2,000,000 for the commercial mole
and harbor.
* The pay of ofHcers of the line and
engineers in the German navy differs
greatly In the several grades holding
the same relative rank. Thus, a cap
tain lieutenant receives $840, while the
engineer of the same rank gets $1140, a
corvette captain's salary is $1230, and
the ranking engineer's $1320. It is to
be noted, however, that there is quite
a difference In the ages at which line
The increase of the enlisted force in
the navy from 11,500 in 1S93 to nearly
35,000 at the present time has necessi
tated making corresponding provision
for the retention of offenders against
the military laws. The naval prison at
Boston accommodates about 150; the
prison-ship Southerly, at Portsmouth,
X. H.. 150, and the prison at Mare Is
land has been extended to a capacity
for 52. In the Philippines prisoners are
confined at Cavite. Real criminals are
sent to Wethersfleld, Conn., or to San
Quentin, according to whether the
crimes have been committed on the At
lantic or Pacific Coast.
The old ironclad Audacious has been
fitted to serve as a base for destroyers,
and is to be stationed at Fellxtowe. The
cost amounted to $300,000, a sum which
may be designated as a clear waste of
money, instances of which are quite
frequent in the British navy.
DOCKYARD AT GIBRALTAR.
A naval prison is to be built at Ports
mouth, N. H., at an estimated cost of
$152,498 29. The administration building
is to be 76 feet square and 126 feet in
height. Two wings 263 feet in length
and r>2 feet wide contain 640 cells, di
vided into four tiers In two rows. Each
cell is 5 feet 8 inches wide, 11 feet long
and 8 feet in heicrht, and are provided
with a wash basin and a steel swinging
bunk at the side. On the basement floor
are the sick ward, shower bath (accom
modating SO men at one time), laundry,
kitchen and storerooms. The entire
building is to be of steel and concrete
construction, thus insuring the best
sanitary conditions, and making escape
of prisoners practically impossible.
which period It has served as a re
ceiving shin. The Minneapolis is to
make a training cruise along the coast
with upward of 400 men for the ma
chinery department, including firemen,
oilers, coal passers, etc. As the ship is
fitted with the old style Scotch boilers,
the experience gained by the firemen
will be of little use in future manipu
lation of the modern water-tube boilers,
which are exclusively used in the bat
tle-ships and armored cruisers under
construction.
WORK ON NEW "WARSHIPS.
Following is the status of progress on
vessels now building for the United
States navy:
The Swedish- marine budget for the
next meeting of the Riksdag provides
for an armored cruiser of the Fylgla
type, 4600 tons and twenty-one and one
half knots speed, to cost $1,750,000; two
torpedo cruisers at a cost of $500,000,
and nine torpedo boats of the first and
second class. By 1906 Sweden will have
fifty torpedo boats of all classes, and
in the future no boats are to be built
abroad, the last one being thÂ» Mode, a
destroyer of 400 tons, built by Yarrow
In 1902, which made the phenomenal
speed of 32.4 knots on her trial, but
which, after Its delivery in Sweden,
barely exceeded twenty-eight knots,
when fully equipped for service.
The Swedish balloonshipâ the first of
Its kindâ has been experimented with
for two months with satisfactory re
sults and two more are to be added as
useful adjuncts to the coast defense
service. The balloon is carried in a
specially constructed barge towed by a
steamer and sent up in the locality de
sired for observations over land and
sea. The longest time of ascension dur
ing the trials was eight hours, remain
ing at a heieht of over one mile. It
has been demonstrated that an Inter
change of crews is necessary and It is
also likely that the towing steamer may
be dispensed with and the barge will be
fitted with the requisite means of loco
motion.
General Ordonez, a distinguished
Spanish ordnance expert, has designed
a gun sending a shell weighing 560
pounds a distance of eight miles and
capable of penetrating eighteen inches
of modern armor at a distance of 3500
feet.
and engineer officers reach their re
spective promotions, for while the cap
tain lieutenant and the corvette captain
attain their ranks at- thirty and thir
ty-five years respectively the engineers
of corresponding rank are 42 and DO
years old.
The Germania yard at Kiel has built
a submarine boat from the plans of its
inventor, a Spanish engineer, and pur
chased the invention outright after its
first trial trips. The boat is propelled
by electricity and during its maneuvers
in Eckernfoerde Bay remained sub
merged for two hours. An ingenious
method enables it to maintain its posi
tion after firing its torpedo and It' is
as easily managed as a vessel floating
on the water.
Fourteen useless vessels have been
removed from the Italian navy list and
are to be sold or broken up. Among
these are the torpedo cruiser Ccnnenza,
built in 1887, intended to have a speed
of twenty knots, which was never real
ized, ahd the vessel proved an utter
failure. The gunboat Sebastiano Ve
niero, built inlSS4, is likewise con
demned. Two broadside frigates, Anco
na and San Martino, built in 1863, and
the floating battery Terrible, launched
in 1S62, are also on the list, and the
other nine vessels are gunboats which
have<long ago outlived their usefulness
and were only a source of expense for
care and maintenance.

Quartermaster J. de L. Lafltte said
that the day after they left Nagasaki
four Japanese were found covered up
by coal in the bins. They worked their
passage over and as the transport en
tered the harbor were placed in the brig
and will be deported when the trans
port returns, which will be about the
first of December.
Captain Lafltte said that not a .single
death had occurred upon the round
trip, which is a record that no other
transport in the service can boast of.
Following were the passengers:
The United States transport Logan
arrived early yesterday morning from
Manila. She brings the Fifteenth Uni
ted States Cavalry, thirty civilian pas
sengers, 1 thirty casuals, two insane and
four stowaways. The passage over
was entirely uneventful. The weather
was fine during the entire trip. The
Logan sailed from Manila on October
15, from Nagasaki on the 20th and from
Honolulu on November 7, making the
trip in thirty days.
The Fifteenth Cavalry was organized
at the Presidio in February, 1901. Five
troops went to Manila soon after, the
organization, and the remaining seven
went in January. 1901, in command of
their organizer, Colonel W. M. Wallace,
who has been with them during their
campaign in the Philippines.
They return In line health and spirits,
and will remain in camp at the Presidio
until Thursday, when half of the com
mand will ro to Fort Meyer, Va., and
the others to Fort Ethan Allen, Ver

remark regarding the race of which he
is a member: "We New Englanders are
fine specimens of humanity â when we
are transplanted."
"The choosing of the path is the
marking point of the wrecks to be
found in the cities of the country. Note
those who have taken the pleasures of
sin as their path and you will also
mark the wrecks of humanity.
"Moses did not forget the teachings
of his mother. Remember the precept
to honor thy father and thy mother.
Look at the children who have been
given every advantage by their parents
and who grow up ashamed of them.
The most despicable of all in this world
is the child who accepts the toil of his
father or mother and in time of pros
perity is ashamed of the honest hands
that gave all for their children." â¢
The speaker then paid a tribute to
the late President McKinley and told
how he had treated .his mother with
every kindness and consideration and
how he had placed her close to him
when he was sworn into office as the
chief magistrate of the nation, and had
kissed her in the presence of thousands
at the Inauguration ceremony in Wash
ington.
Continuing Rev. Mr. Larkin said:
"Men to be successful must toil. It
Is no use waiting for the opportunity to
come along. It Is easy enough for men
to say they will work hard when they
see great success ahead of them. Suc
cess in life comes to those who have
faith in God and in character. To do
right, to be good and true, will bring
success, despite privations and misfor
tunes. .
"We must be faithful to God and
leave the results to Him. even if the
way "be tangled. If we have faith real
success will reward our efforts. Forget
not that the pleasures of sin- lead to
death/while the pleasures of right will
lead to the everlasting life."

LIFE'S TURNING POINT.
"The temptations that surround those
who are born rich are many, and those
who are born rich and avoid tempta
tions are few. On the other hand,
there are thousands of men and women
who have toiled for a living who are
the exceptions to the rule that gov
erns those born rich.
"Moses had the opportunity of be*
coming the successor of thÂ« great Pha
roah, Rameses II, because he was
brought up as a Prince in the palace
of the Egyptian ruler. But Moses re
slated temptation. He threw aside the
possibility of leading a life of ease and
threw his lot in with his own people.
"He went through hardships and pri
vations in order to help his own race
and lead them ' from bondage. This
showed his real greatness and success.
"People often say of a reformer that
he is wasting his . time and that he
cannot accomplish any good. This
might have been sajd ot Moses. But
Moses realized that the truth was the
truth and right was right, and that
they would, with God's help, prevail
despite obstacles.
"Moses for a long time might have
felt that he was wasting his time and
efforts, fpr years passed ere he suc
ceeded In his mission. He selected the
path he was to follow and followed it
until success came to him.
"So it is with all men and "women.
The time comes when, we have to
choose between a life of toll and sacri
fice and one of idleness and the pleas
ures of sin. The pleasure of sin is for a
season, and, like the wages of sin, is
death.
TEST OF REAIi GREATNESS.
"Moses passed through great adver
sity and there is no teacher of more
value than the one of adversity. There
are many men who do not know how
to use money wisely, but there are
thousands who do and they are the
ones who have had to work for and
save money.
"The real success in life is that of
character and purpose. The great law
giver and statesman, Moses, is an ex
ample of real success. History was
born when he led Israel out of Egypt,
and the leaders of the Athenians and
of Greece fade into insignificance.
"The laws of Moses are the basis of
all laws. He received divine inspira
tion and the world has never been able
to add to his laws. He is associated
with the founder of Christianity and
like him was well trained in his youth.
"His mother was his trainer and Mo
ses was taught the religion of his peo
ple by his mother. Many men owe
greatness to their mothers. The oppor
tunity of motherhood to train men to
become great in the world is not fully
appreciated.
"Moses received part of his education
in the great library and university of
the city of Thebes, but he also received
the most valuable part of his education
from his mother.
TELLS OF LITE OF MOSES.
"How many people are willing to be
less successful in getting things in or
der to take time to think? Most peo
ple take time to think when they are
not making money.
"Many people are scheming to be
come rich and prosperous, honestly if
they can and dishonestly if they must,
All the world applauded Schwab until
he was found out and now the people
are doing something else.
"It has been stated that Napoleon
was possible in France because France
was filled with little Napoleons.
Schwab is possible in America because
the country is niled with little
Schwabs.
Rev. F. M. Larkin, pastor of Grace
Methodist Church, Twenty-flrst and
Capp streets, delivered his second ad
dress on "Successful Men" last even
ing *at his church before a large con
gregation.
The speaker dealt with his subject
in a forceful manner and quoted a re
cent newspaper editorial dealing with
"Mr. Schwab is the famous president of
the steel trust, He declared that thou
sands of people were toiling and plan
ning (without realizing that they were
worshiping at the shrine of success.
"To some people," said the speaker,
"Mr. Schwab is the famous prsident of
the steel trust, while to others he is
the infamous head of that organiza
tion. It is claimed that Schwab's suc
cess was simply that' of a schemer
among confidence men; he sold proper
ty worth seven millions for thirty mil
lions and thus became rich.

Opta, a girl graduate, is about to
marry a. title- and taboos the Shake
spearean idea that uneasy lies the head
that, wears a crown. A magic spell
is cast over her by Clie, goddess of his
tory- While in this profound state she
is made the auditor of the troubles that
befell the crowned female heads of an
cient and medieval history. Among the
well-known characters represented
were: Constance. Margaret d'AnJou,
Anne of Warwick, Elizabeth Woodville.
Slary Tudor. Mary Queen of Scots,
Elizabeth of England and Marie An
toinette. Opta sees the folly of her
intentions and. departs from the idea
with general satisfaction.
The whole plot was ably worked out
by the young actresses,

A pleasant programme was rendered

PBEMMINARY HEARING
IN LAND FRAUD CASES
Assistant Attorney General Heney
Returns From Portland, Where
He Represented Prosecution.
Francis J. Heney, Assistant Attorney
General of the United States, arrived
In this city yesterday from Portland,
where he has for the last week of
ficiated as prosecuting attorney in the
land fraud cases pending in that city.
The cases at present before the court
are the first dealing with a series of
extensive land frauds, and though up
to the present time there have been
no actual decisions rendered, the pre
liminary hearings have caused consid
erable speculation as to what these de
cisions will be.
The demurrers to indictments have
been argued and Judge Bellinger said
he would be able to decide them' by
Wednesday of this week. The indict
ments will be sustained and the cases
will be tried early in December in
Portland.
The defendants are Horace G. Mc-
Kinley, S. A- D. Peuter. M. L. Watson,
Gus Huff and Marie Ware.
Miss Ware is at present holding the
position of United States Commission
er, having succeeded her fathed to that
position some months past.
The land under discussion is situated
a few miles south of Bohemia, near
Cottage Grove, Or., and it is alleged
that Miss Ware, who is a great friend
of Peuter, forged signatures to several
deeds, after which the property was
sold to Clyde Lloyd.
Peuter is an old timer, with quite a
record, and is supposed to have backed
the scheme financially. ;i !>Â»-
Hurley Is Not Positive.
J. T. Hurley, a grocer at Webster and
Hayes streets, who was held up In his
store by two masked robbers on the
night of November 4 and relieved of
about $125, took a look in the City
Prison yeserday at Ernest L. Good and
Lester Good, the two men suspected of
holding up the conductor and gripman
of a Hayes-street car on Friday night.
Hurley eaid the men in. general appear
ance answered the description of the
two footpads who robbed him; and al
! though he was "morally certain they
were the men, he would not positively
. swear to It. Detectives Dinan and
i Wren are still working on the case of
I the car. hold-up.

MEETS DEATIT. IN BAY.
Unidentified Man Falls From Wliarf
and Is Drowned.
An unidentified man fell into the bay
yesterday afternoon at the foot of Mis
sion street and was drowned. Whether
he lost his batlance and fell overboard,
or whether it was a direct case of sui
cide is not known. If it was a case of
suicide, man took an unusual time
and place for the act, as the dock was
crowded with people at the time. Men,
women and children rushed to the res
cue and threw boards, empty crates
and gang planks into the water near
the unfortunate man. I
Long ropes were procured, but the
strong ebbing tide carried the drowning
man toward the ferry slip. From the
ferry-boat Oakland a rowboat put out.
The man in the water was seized, but
died as he was hauled on board the
boat. He was about 70 years of age
and poorly but. neatly clad. Nothing
was found to give a clew to his iden
tity. ' He had a silver watch, a pair of
spectacles' and several lottery tickets,
but no money.

Tyndall Lectures on Success.
A large audience attended the psy
chological lecture on "The Elements of
Success," by Dr. Alex.^ J. Mclvor-
Tyndall at Steinway .Hall last night.
Dr. .Tyndall treated the subject of suc
cess from the standpoint of psychology,
and spoke of the two kinds of success
that we see manifested on the ma
terial plane. Â¦ The demonstrations that
foHowed were particularly convincing,
and many of them were startling
enough to be; regarded as magic. The
naming of a word and page in a closed
book, and the successful naming of
the numbers on a bank : note In the
pocket; of a' member of the â¢ committee'
were i experiments that 'aroused Â« great
enthusiasm and applause. . Next Sun
day evening; Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall will
again;talk;ph the subject of "Thought
Transference and Telepathy.":
Senator Platt laa great boss in politics,
but his enemies may now see hla feathers
faU " â
Snailham had his encounter in a
south of Market street saloon. He re
pented the love speeches uttered by a
hanger-on of the place and informed
the latter that the subject of his con
versation was already "won." A fight
ensued and Snailham hit his man so
hard that he was forced to go to the
hospital to have his hand treated.
The aftermath of the telephone girls'
ball on Saturday night was hardly a
happy occasion for R. W. Burton, an
Iron worker, and Thomas Snailham. an
erstwhile prize fighter. Both wound up
at the Emergency Hospital yesterday
morning, Burton to be treated for
bruises inflicted by a gang of jilted
swains and Snailham for a broken
finger, resulting from a beating he ad
ministered to a youth . who dared ex
press his affections for a cay "hello"
girL The trouble in both instances
started at the telephone girls' balL
Burton was picked up at the corner
of Gough and Fulton Btreets, where he
had lain for some time in an uncon
scious condition. According to his story
he was attacked by three men who be
came jealous of his attentions to one
of the fair attendants at the telephone
girls' ball. After giving Burton a sound
thrashing the men ran away, leaving
their victim to recover as best he
could.
FIGHT OVEB "HELLO" GIBI/S.
Two Men Have Sad Experiences as
the Result of Ball.
Hughes, who is a ticket agent for the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company,
had been attending the telephone girls'
ball at the Pavilion on Saturday night.
On Sunday morning at 6 o'clock, the
revelries of the occasion having come to
an end, Hughes started to go home.
Ab he was walking toward City Hall
avenue he noticed that he was being
followed by four or five men. As he
turned the corner into the avenue one
of the men struck him a powerful blow
on the face, which stunned him mo
mentarily, and before he could regain
his senses the whole gang jumped on
him and gave him a terrific beating,
They hit him on the head and felled
him to the sidewalk, where they left
him unconscious. In this condition he
was found by passersby and conveyed
to the Emergency Hospital, where Dr.
Armistead dressed his wounds, which
were of a serious but not dangerous
character. When he regained conscious^
ness he stated he had been robbed of
bis hat, a new overcoat, a diamond
ccarfpln and a purse containing $14.
Later in the day he recovered suffi
ciently to be removed to his rÂ£&id*nce,
330 Lexington avenue.
Henry G. Hughes was severely beaten
and robbed at an early hour yesterday
morning in front of the City Hall, and
is laid up from the effects of the in
juries he received.
The officials of the company at the
car house did all in their power to keep
the facts of the collision a secret. They
stated that no one had been hurt and
even went so far as to say that ; the
wagon was not wrecked.
Patrolman McHugh of the Mission
Street Police Station was near the
scene when the collision occurred. He
called up the ambulances from the two
hospitals named and had the patients
removed. McHugh reported the mat
ter to the station, but no arrests were
made.
John Parker of 980 China avenue,
driver of ,the wrecked wagon, had a
miraculous escape from death. Ac
cording to his story he was returning
from town and about 6:45 o'clock was
rounding the turn near College Hill
when the car struck him. He was
pitched several feet into the air, but
luckily escaped injury. His horse was
also uninjured, but the wagon was
smashed into splinters.
The car was in charge of Motorman
F. E. McCall and Conductor J. B. Hay.
McCall states that he did not see the
wagon till he rounded the turn. As
soon as he perceived the danger he ap
plied the brakes, but before the car
could be brought to a standstill the
collision occurred.
As electric car No." 1005 of the Mis
sion street line was rounding a sharp
curve at College Hill, near the Ingleside
track, on its way to town late yester
day afternoon, it collided with a* ped
dler's wagon, smashine- the vehicle to
splinters and injuring three of the pas
sengers on the car. ,The car, which 'is
one of the largest on the line, hit the
wagon with such force that the pas
sengers were thrown violently about
and a panic ensued. Luckily there
were only a few persons on thecar at
the. time, otherwise the accident might
have proved a fatal one.
The injured are Evan Jackson of 15
Stanley; place, a special policeman em
ployed by the Southern Pacific; M.
Ciarie, a laborer employed a^ Golden
Gate Park, and J. H. Lord, a carpen
ter, of 3662 Sixteenth street. Jackson
suffered a fracture of one of the bones
of his right leg besides internal in
juries which may prove serious. Clarle
was Jpadly bruised on the body, while
Lord received a severe shaking up and
may be suffering from internal injuries.
Jackson and Ciarie- were taken to the
Railroad Hospital and Lord to St.
Luke's.
Captain George Washington Ruthers,
United States army, whose elopement,
secret marriage and legal separation
from' his young and pretty bride are in
cidents of his life that have been crowd
ed together into a very short space
of time- and have furnished interesting
reading matter to his many friends. Is
at the Occidental Hotel. But a_few
months ago he departed for the .rnn
ippines, a happy husband and \vitn
mind filled with plans for his future
married life. Yesterday he returned on
the transport Logan, legally shorn of a
husband's responsibilities and loo 1 â¢
a bit dejected in spirit as he entered tne
hotel and affixed his signature on the
register, the pages of which, only a
brief period back, bore the name oi
'â¢Captain Ruthers and wife."
Captain Ruthers' elopement to ban
Jose with Miss Gladys Dorsey, daugh
ter of Attorney John Webster Dorsey
and Mattie BrinkerhofT Dorsey.the well
known miniature painter, was quite an
interesting affair, at least to the friends
of the young couple, as well as dis
tressing to the young woman's parents,
who, it seems, were not advised of her
matrimonial intentions until home 'time
after the marriage had been quietly cel
ebrated. Meanwhile Captain Ruthers
hud departed for the Philiplpnes and
his military associates there were look
ing forward to the time when his young
bride would join him, when the unex
pected news came to them that Mrs.
Ruthers had already taken step3 to have
her marriage annulled. Her ground for
action was that at the time of her
marriage she had not attained her ma
jority.
Mrs. Ruthers' suit for annulment
was filed in April. The captain,
unable to journey here, was rep
resented in court by Attorney ' Spill
man, who announced the determi
nation of his client to fight his wife's
suit. Having clearly established her
claim, however, Judge Hftbbard, on
September 18, granted the young wife's
prayer and Gladys Dorsey returned to
the home of her mother, while a letter
conveyed to Captain Rutners'the news
of his loss. â¢ \
At the time that the captain and
Miss Dorsey planned their elopement
her mother and father were plaintiff
and defendant In a divorce suit in this
city.
The officers of the union are making
every effort to ascertain the identity
of the suicide and hope by a thorough
search of the records of the organiza
tion tc learn whose body it was that
lay for sc many months the prey of
weather and decomposition until all
traces of what he once was were wiped
away.
At first it was supposed that the dead
man was John P. Bell, formerly secre
tary of the Pacific Coast Marine Fire
men's Union, who was last seen on
May 30. After his disappearance it
was discovered that he was short $1700 #
in His Hccounts. Since the day when
he went out ol the lives of his wife,
mother and comrades not the slightest
word has been received from him.
No one knows whether he is alive or
dead. His wife, distracted with uncer
tainty, went to the Morgue yesterday
under the escort of Detective Tom Cole
man to see if she could Identify the
remains as those of her husband. From
the description of the clothing and the
contents of the pockets she immediately
became assured that -the body was not
that of her husband. When he left
home he had no overcoat and the um
brella was not his. Neither did the
clothing correspond to that worn by
him when "he disappeared. His mother,
when seen ot hei home at Ninth and
Mission streets, was equally positive
that the body could not be that of her
son.
The grewsome find was made hy
John Landini of 1207 Stanyan street
and George Prosek of 1215 Stanyan
street. They had gone to the forest to
pick mushrooms and midway between
the Affiliated Colleges and the Alms
house they came across the headless
trunk, lying at the base of a little
knoll. Above dangled a light rope with
a noose at the end. Further search
disclosed the head, some twelve feet
away from the body. They ran from
the shadows of the forest and tele
phoned to the Coroner's office. Deputy
Coroner Brown went at once to the
scene and took charge of the body.
CLOTHING BEARS NO MARKS.
Alongside of the tree from which
dangled the rope was found a heavy
chinchilla overcoat. The body was
dressed In a dark brown coat of cheap
material, fustian jacket, dark striped
trousers and gray waistcoat. As far
as could be ascertained the underwear
was of rough material.
In the pockets of the coat were found
an empty pocketbook, a memorandum
book without .any trace of writing, a
copy of the constitution and by-laws of
the Pacific Coast Marine Firemen's
Union and a certificate of membership
in the union. Apparently the name of
the member and the date of his admis
sion, which had originally been written
in ink, had been erased with a knife.
Instead was scrawled across the face
of the certificate the pathetic message,
unsigned. "If you want to bury me,
I'm thankful to you." The handwrit
ing gave evidences of extreme nerv
ousness, as though the writer were ap
palled at the swift plunge Into eternity
he was about to make.
A close examination of the .erased
certificate failed to reveal the slightest
clew to the name. On the date line
could be deciphered the letter "J,"
which may have been January before
the erasure. Rain and wind had dealt
hardly with the clothing and no mark
could be deciphered on any of it^ Noth
ing but the bare bones of the skeleton
and* the grinning face of the skull re
mained to tell of one who found the
burden of life too heavy to bear and
chose the shadows of a forest and a
hangman's knot to solve the problem
of the herealter.
IS NOT BELL'S BODY.
Spectrally swaying from the limb of
a tree in Sutro forest the dead body of
an unidentified man hung until natural
decomposition parted the head and
trunk of the corpse. Then the trunk
rolled off In one direction and the head
in another. The looped rope, hanging
from the limb, alone gave mute evi
dence of the cause of the tragedy.
Whoever it was who gave himself up
to death deliberately months ago in the
dim shadows of the wood, he over
looked not the smallest detail that
would prevent his identity from be
coming known. In the clothing of the
dead man there was nothing by which
It could be learned what man had ten
anted the bundle of rags enwrapping
the grisly skeleton.
According to the stories told by the
two men in custody, Shaughneasy came
to their room, at 606 Howard street,
Â¦about 4 o'clock yesterday morning.
Abcrai 11 o'clock Doyle went out to
purchase some whisky and â¢ upon his
return endeavored to awake Shaugh
nessy, but without success. Dr. A. P.
Poaps was summoned and upon ex
amination found that Shaughnessy was
in a dangerous condition and advised
his removal to the hospital. The am
bulance was summoned, but the uncon
scious man. died before reaching the
hospital.
The Coroner's office was notified and
the body removed to the Morgue. The
body was identitled by two brothers of
the dead man, William and George
Shaughnessy, who stated that they had
last seen their brother alive at 9 o'clock
Saturday night in company with a
woman named Harper, in a lodging
house on Fourth street, below Bryant.
If the autopsy reveals the fact that
death was due to an overdose of mor
phine, the police, up to the present,
time, are at sea as to a motive for
murder. If the drug was not self ad
ministered. It has been learned that
Michael. Shaughnessy, a brother of the
dead man, who recently returned from
Alaska, may have given him some
money. Thfa would be sufficient induce
ment to many ex-convicts now sojourn
ing in the city to put him out of the
way by the use of a method with which
they are familiar.
Eight years ago a saloon-keeper on
Howard street named Hughes was ar
rested for battery upon Shaughnessy's
father. While Hughes jvas waiting out
side Judge Conlan's Courtroom in the
City Hall for the case to be called
Shaughnessy shot him, inflicting a seri
ous wound. Shaughnessy was arrested
on a charge of assault to murder and
was convicted by a jury in Judge Law
lor's Court. His defense was that
Hughes attacked his father with an
Icepick and he was justified In shooting
his victim. He was sentenced to eight
years' Imprisonment in San Quentln
and was released about one year ago.
John Shaughnessy, a well-known ex
convict, who came into prominence
during the legislative investigation of
the abuses of the stralghtjacket at the
State penitentiaries by reason of the
fact that both of his hands were per
manently crippled by the use of the in
strument oX torture, died yesterday
afternoon while en route to the Central
Emergency Hospital, under peculiar
circumstances, and the physicians say
that death was due from â¢ an overdose
of morphine. Detectives O'Dea and
Mulcahey. are investigating the case,
and as a result Oliver P. Danis, alias
"Black Pat." and Billy Doyle, ex-con
victs, are beine detained at the City
Prison on suspicion of having caused
Shaughnessy's death.
