Fort* Bragg" have formed themselves into
.a secret Â¦'â¢organization "known as* "The
Citizens* League of Font ' Bragg* No. -.1.
Incorporated." "
â¢TheÂ«|dea fop this league was obtained
from Indian'apolls. . where.- -in March .of
â¢this year.,*. -was' formed- the independent
Americjin. Mechanics'" Union,- : Incorpor
ated. " This Indiana organization has be
come' national- in its scope"and the Fort
Bragg!, league" has affiliated "with it.
.Branches'/of th'e. organization- have been
formed- in many j cities . of Â¦ the. middle
West-apd although "Fort Bragg is -the
first in' the far West, so -much inquiry
has been . received by- the local officers
from other points ' that there is little
doubt that all the larger cillea of the
â¢coast will- before long support leagues.
The Fort Brags league has availed it
self of the incorporation laws in order
that "it may have r a legal existence and
be in a position to protect its member*
as well as attack its adversaries, its
legal identity' giving it a standing: In
court that It would not have otherwise.
The objects of the league axe thus set
forth in the articles of incorporation on
file at Sacramento:
The purposes for which it iÂ» formed 'are to
encourage Industry. â¢ economy, honesty and
truthfulness among Its members; to maintain
amicable relations between employes and em
ployers of labor; to assist its individual mem
bers in obtaining the highest wagas, shortest
hours and best conditions consistent with the
general good of all concerned by an intelligent
application of energies; to promote all forms
of productive industry and general trade and
increase the â¢ employment of labor at good
wages: to prevent all unjust and unreasonable
discrimination against any of the members by
any person, combination or conspiracy 'to pre
vent such members from securing employment
in any branch of industry; to protect and de
fend its members against any and all attempts
by any person or combination of persons to
abridge the Inalienable rights of all mankind
to work for such wages as shall be mutually
satisfactory to the individual workman anÂ«l his
employer: to protect the Independent workmen
In their independence: to promote and encour
age an earnest co-operation with employers
and legitimate business methods; to oppose
strikes, lockouts, boycotts and blacklists, and
to compel labor unions to obey the laws.
The directors of the Fort Bragg league
are appointed, for one year. Those that
will act. for. the first year are: John-E.
Weller. Edward Banker, F. C. Jackson,
W. A McCornack. H. F. Milliken. H.
Holmes, Ira H. Carlisle. Frank Sundeltn,
Thomas Bourns, all of Fort Bragg, Men
docino County.
The league has already more than
three hundred members and of these not
a few were recruited from the ranks of
the unions. The organization 13 popular
with the citizens who have suffered from
the strike and is gamins in Â¦trengtb
every day. RMS ~

First to Everyman comes Fellowship
after he has felt, the awakening horror of
Death's message. Fellowship will surely
not desert Everyman, who has been so
long his friend. Fellowship,. by .the way
is not so well in the. picture as. the* rest
of the cast t "spelling a too modern note cot
A triumphant make-up Is that of Death,"
and a singularly convincing portrayal. He
Is a skeleton- marvelously mimicked, "with
.the red velvet .cap adding" a shudder .of
contrast, and a dry', rattling voice -.that hi
la admirable consonance with . the . part.
Not once .even* here, " nor ' elsewhere
throughout the play, w.as the perfection
of the atmosphere disturbed; ..Death re
ceived the- Lord's command, to summon
Everyman from his sins! and in a solemn
hush obeys the command, to the tune of
an actual shiver of sympathy in the audi
dlence. as t,he pretty roysterer, Jute ' v In
hand; appears to- answer the summqna.
In the actress' who interprets Every-r
man, the cast is singularly fortunate.. The
nameless .young woman has a delicately
ascetic profile, Â¦ a grace- of i carriage, a
purity of diction, a vocal beauty, a refined
intelllgence v that Insure the best for the
role. Particularly .admirable is the young
woman's facial expression. The progress
from- the gay^worldllng to the -sincere
penitent is most Impressively painted. As
Everyman, repentant, on his way to the
tomb, in his difficult processional through
the audience, the actress achieved a spirit
uality of expression almost inspired. In
all phases of the role, indeed, she shows
herself effective. " .
Neither audacious nor -irreverent does
this singular experiment* appear*. - "With
profound dignity the actor who under
takes the part arraigns trie. erring Every
man, "drowned In sin and cumbered with
riches," accusing him of having forgot
ten his -maker. He summons Death, who
answers- with a horn > and the ominous
beat. of a drum, and' appears then la an?
swer to tKe command. , â¢

. Dear : Eirsâ Your, letter in' answer to
â¢mine at hand syDme days ago. * You re-
Quested me to let you: hear ' f rom me
again in twenty days, s(r I write 5 to-day.
'"' JCow. .my dÂ«ar sirs, I am going to write
yoix a long letter;, and I want you to hear
what .1; have to sayl If thero ever "was a
grateful man on the face of the earth, it
is the author of; this letter.' You remem-
ber I : wrote you about my daughter hav--
ing Diabetes, and my only child; and she
is so dear to me arid my Wife. The phy-
Â«i dans' who. treated, her told us that all
hope had vanished: Now let me give, you
the names of the physicians. Here thÂ«*y
â¢ ere, good -physicians, â¢ too:. Dr. Zigler.
Mingo, O.; Dr. Sharp, Woodstock, O.. and
Dr. S. C. Moore, Urbana, O. . All of these
told us that'no man on earth could cure
her â that, the case was beyond the reach
of medical skilL But, thank God, the.
Great Master sent the raven. Let me tell
you who the raven was. He was a young
physician who. has been in. the practice
of medicine two years. He came- from
Columbus, O., this spring and is bonding
with me. I keep a small hotel in a lit-
tle town called Cable on the Panhandle
Railroad. This doctor Is a fine physician
and surgeon, and he would, call me in his
office an'd read to me from his books on
the malady of my dear child, and I saw
tha': the authors of the: medical works
gave the matter up. One day this doctor
was reading in a. Cincinnati paper aiid
discovered your cure. He said to me:
"You might try it. It will do no .harm,
and I am sure it will not do her much
good." Now this -was the raven that
brought the clad tidings. ";;;I;-
When my daughter, commenced. taking
It she was nothing but a physical wreck.
Her' mind was. gone, her eyesight was
poing, and the worst case on record.
Sugar was 13 per cent They said it
was the worst case they ever saw.
She has now taken four bottles, and' I
pot four more, and wnat do you think?
She spent two days at the fair and is
feeling real fine; Oh, may God bless
your medicine!
I will pen you again !n ten days. The
physicians claim here that the cure is
wonderful. One says: "If your daughter
is cured you ought to lecture on- It."
Yours fraternally,

"Did Mr. 'WTiite sjay anything to. yoii
about Kis relations | with any women?"
asked Aitken. . 'Â¦ \\ ' . Â¦
"Yes, sir. 'He said' he could; not get fid
of thenv without . causing- a scandal. That
was thie reason. h.e- gave me. why he.
wanted me tb gQ back to. New York,".
rcpUed Mrs. White. . :

KNEW NOTHING OF DIVORCE..
"Did you- come to San Francisco m.
18S4?" " "
"Yes. sir; I came here and stayed at
the Rosa House. Mr. White met me at
the Oakland, pier when the train came
in. "He remained with me for two weeks
and then compelled me ; to go back to
New York."
"Did he say anything about getting a
divorce from you?" '
"Never," answered the witness very
positively. ' 'â¢ ' i
The witness further testified she came,
to San Francisco In 1890, long after the
time White secured the divorce. She' said
she stayed at a boarding-house for four
weeks and White never told her that she
was no longer his wife. She told of num
erous visits to this city and the decep
tion practiced upon her. She said she
never knew she was divorced until four
years after White's death in the Baldwin
Hotel 1 fire. She gained this information
from Mr. Pierce. The witness told of
White's visit to New York in 1S95 or 1896
and his' stay in that city for four weeks.
She swore Â¦ that White told her to goto
her mother's houso and that he gave her
$1200 In the presence of a Mr. Morrisey,
a brother-in-law. ; She said the money
was used in fixing up the house. â¢
"When did he say he would Join you
In New York?" the witness was asked.

ADMISSION DAY
RECENTLY The -Call directed attention - to a
statement of Henry Watterson that tnVnext
Democratic national convention would be
controlled by moderate men holding a middle place
between Cleveland and Bryan, and that as a result
Bryan would bolt. The prediction was not looked,
upon as a part of the-serious politics of the time, but
was treated as a new evidence of Watterson' s' unfail
ing ability to be interesting even 'during the silly
season. It now appears, however, that it is the opin
ion: of a good 'mafi'y in Nebraska that the bolt may
take place if the Platte River. orator finds his Kan
sas' City platform swept away by a political cyclone.
In reviewing the canvass of his. party for a Presi
dential candidate, Watterson said: "The talk of
Cleveland "(or a fourth nomination and" a third elec
tion is too wild to be considered by sensible people.
As for Bryan, he will not carry a corporal's guard
with him. into the next convention, and when he
boltsâ as he will â there will be few or none to fol
low him."
Testimony- confirming that view of the probable
future of .Bryan comes from. Grand Island, Nebraska,
â¢where the State convention of the Populists has just
been held. A report says: ."According to the speech
before the"coiivention by M. F. Harrjngton, Â°a leader
among Nebraska. Populists and in the confidence. oL,
Bryan, if the Bryan following finds itself outnum-"
ber.ed in the Democratic national convention, it will
bolt and nominate a third ticket. Towne is favored
by BryaJi as the Head of this bolting contingent, ac
cording t.o the Harrington speech. Considerable in
terest is taken here in that speech./^ It seems to fore
shadow that the Bryan followers will, before resort- â¢
ing to -rash measures, go to the Democratic conven
tion in an effort* to control it. Tpwne, it is now
believed, will be a* delegate from New York City, and
will -ably second the efforts of the Bryanites. In
deed, it may be that he will be their leader on the
convention floor, for nobody supposes that Bryan
himself will be a delegate.".
Of course the statement jof a Populist orator ad
dressing a Populist cenvention is.- no o t any more re
liable" than' a statement of Colonel Watterson talk
ing to reporters in New York in the irresponsible,
freedom of a Kentuckian on o a vacation; o but trre. in
terest taken in* the speech by Nebraska politfcians
implies that it was something more than a mere
whoop in the woods. It is therefore quhe probable
that the extreme silver men will bolt Jhe Democratic
party next, year exactly as Senator .Teller and Tils
followers bolted the Republican party in 1896. -There
will then be once more three tickets in the field and
a return to so'meth.ing like the 'politics that pre
vailed inÂ«Â«he West 'in th,e old days before the fusion,
o^ the Denrocrats with Che Populists made- Bryan
a Presidential possibility. .Such a contest would be
interesting, for, while it would assure the victory of
the Republicans and putÂ«an end to any excitement on
t'hat score, it would provide a good straight out
fight between the radicals and the conservatives in
thjs ranks of the opposition and put an end. to the
confusion tjiat has prevailed for, the last eight years.

Miss McGrath" saw the blaze and aulet

stantly the pupils, numbering' nearly five
hundred, filed out of the school building
in fine order and without a -sound. No.
time was taken to secure hats "or coats
an.d the building was emptied- in exactly
one minute and a half without the slight
est accident. After the hre was under
control the pupils .went back to their

pened to disturb the routine of "school
duties. :. . Â¦. ; . _.[â¢'.
A double alarm was rung yesterday
'morning from box 154 for a fire in the
hay barn and stables of the Morton
Draylng Company on Bryant street, be
tween Sixth and Seventh. The blaze was
extinguished in ten minutes and the dam
age was nominal.
The pupils of the Starr King School,
which immediately adjoins the ' stables;
gave a sp.Ier.dld exhibition of a fire drill
while the fire was raging. The pupils of
the third grade were being drilled In the
hall by Miss McGrath, principal of the
school assisted by Miss o O'SulIivan and
Miss Humphreys, just as the flre started.
The Rev. Dr. George F. Mains, repre
senting the Methodist Book Concern In
Nev York City, la expected here to-day.
Although It 'is the custom ; of the book
publishing company to send an agent to
the West every year, the visit of Dr.
Mains Is a bit early this year, a fact
which Is attributed to the approaching
conference of the Methodists at PaclOc
Grove, which will convene on September
9. At this meeting it la expected that
the recent charges made against the Rev.
Dr. Hammond, head of the Chinese de
partment of the local church, will be
taken up and disposed of and it la re
garded as probable that Dr. Mains will
participate in the investigation, If one
is ordered. In discussing the matter yes
terday, one of the leading members of
the churc^h said:
. '"While the Hammond case is not a
new one to the California Conference,
the recent charges against Dr. Ham
mond make .It almost necessary that
the coming conference should take some
cognizance of them. If some person, well
q-ualifled to make formal charges against
Dr. Hammond, does so, it will become 'the
duty of the conference to appoint a com
mittee of triah In the absence of an ac
cuser the conference may appoint a com
mittee of investigation and proceed to
probe into the entire matter, in so far
as the charges affect Dr. Hammond. As
yet the doctor has not asked for an in
vestigation and I do not think he will,
but Â«it will be strange if the conference
does not take up the matter."
The conference at Pacific Grove will be
composed of all the preachers of the lo
cal clhurch and will be presided over by
Bishcp Earl Cranston.

OUR DUTY IN TURKEY.
It seems necessary that these things be said, in
view of the loose and inflammatory talk that is being
incited in regard to the Turkish situatio.n. It has
its origin in the habit of loose thinking. In one re-
I spect it may do much harm and be the means of
great, embarrassment. When the Christian clergy of
the United States cry ouf for slaughter and -demand
immediate wan to overthrow the' Turkish empire, it
is quhe natural that erery American Christian mis
sionary in the Sultjrn's 'dominions should â¢ be- sus
pected of interference in civil Affairs and of plotting
for the .overthrow qf the government. Among a
fanatical people, like the Mahometans, this is sure
to cause -bitterness and lead to reprisal in the form
of attack upon missionaries, their schools -and their
When it is remembered that we have
among u's, in the midst of our superior enlighten
ment, people who .make themselves objects of atten
tion .by ;tea ; ring down foreign flags and trampling
them' under foot, we should consider .an excess of
the same feeling among, a- people' who are made the
subject of heated '.denunciation. '
. The sincerity of a Christian is to be doubted when
Kis zeal ta.kes the form of crying for war and slaugh
ter for tjhe propagation' of the faith. The Christian
clergy niay. reconcile with their professions' if they
can, therr demand that the Turk be "wiped off the
face of the- earth," that "the -time has come for. his
Wholesale destruction'," and the other Remands, for
v/ar/bloodshed and. devastation. Those things would
.sound harsh if the reason given -for them were purely
.political, and their p.urpose were the acquisition of
"territory and the extension of. political power. . But
â¢when it: is claimed that all this shall be done in the
interest of. the Christian faith, and for the propaga
tion .of its methods and. practices, to the lay mind it
.appears in ihe forni of -advice that we proceed to do
.exactly what the -Turks are charged with. Hbing. If
it can be, proved to- be. in conformity with the com
mands: "Love your enÂ£nves," : "Love those that!hate
lyou," "Returji not evil for evil, but overcome evil
with good," and the other injunctions, intended to
â¢guide the eourse # of : the Christian, in the midst pf his
enemies, and in the- presence of those Who use him

jn. "conflict in Turkey, for the world's History furnishes
"proofs that' sjlchco'nflicis are the" most "relentless thatÂ°
%:an engage the ferocity of man.- " If one. wish tojknow
their full and awful import he needs bu.t to read- the
story of the long ..wars and persecutions that have
â¢raged between th~e different Christian sects, in which
a tfiousandfo.ia more professed Christians perished
Â¦miserably- under the bloody hands of their, fellow
beliÂ«vers than have been- sacrificed by the Turk and
all non-believers 'combined: ; Â¦
To demand that the Unifed States, as a govern
ment, shall embark in a religious' war is fantastic.
This .Government .is a" political institution, purely,
and'-has* nothing, whatever to 'do with anybody's re-*
ligion or lack of -it. We. protect our own people in
Turkey and elsewhere, equally, whether they be Jew
or Christian, "missionaries or merchants, and whether
they bie our Mahometan wards Â°of Sulu;- or those
who pray -to P.elee irr Hawaii, 'or "the red-skinned
brethren who gyrate in the. sun. dance and. "conjure"
rajri' by rattling pebbles m a dry Bladder. 'But, we
do it asÂ° a pplitical duty, enjoirued by the necessary
implications of the constitution, and as the price of
the loyal allegiance of all who arc under our flag.
The proposition that the United States shall lead
a Christian crusade to slaughter the Turk, or drive
him across the Hellespont, is inadmissible from any.
point of view. This riation is not a religious estab
lishment, nor is it, officially, a Christian nation. It
has no religious function whatever. It js neither
Jew nor Gentile, Christian nor non-Christian, and it
is no .part of its constitutional duty or power to. con
sider.the religious faith of foreign .revolutionists on
one side and a foreign government on the other.
The Turk fought his way into Europe as a result
of the inexpressible corruption, decay, debauchery
and decline of the Christian empire of the East,
that 'began with Justinian and progressed rapidly
under his pidus and predatory successors. The Chris
tian temples .became mosques, and the Turk, by
taking advantage of the weakness and wickedness of
Christendom, improved upon his foothold and ex
tended it. Now that Turkey is as bad as the Eastern
empire was under Justinian, pr.obably the time has
come for The fall of the Mahometan power. Circum
stances will take care of that.
THERE is a revolution in the Turkish empire.
It is probably caused by religious differences
and fanaticism. But it is a revolution so formid
able as to threaten, destruction of the Sultan's sov
ereignty. The duty, of the United States in the sit
uation is . the same as it would be in the presence
of disturbed conditions in any other country. Our
citizens who are there in business, or other pursuits,
must be protected and their treaty rights respected.
Our officials. must be free to come and go and the
flag over, their legations must be an inviolable shel
ter to all who seek it. Beyond that our Government
has no concern with what happens to the Ottoman
empire.

SOME ANSWERS
TO QUERIES BY
CALL READERS
California leads all the States in the acquisition
and preservation of forests, by her purchase of the
great tract in the Big Basin, and the State should
continue the good work by buying the Calaveras big
trees and converting Mount Tamalpais into a State
park.
cial purposes. ? These are now asking that the process
of harvesting :their timber that is ripe and should be
cut be put in charge of expert foresters who will
so direct the operation that the growing crop not
ready for the ax and saw may be preserved and the
forests made permanent and their production con
tinuous.
This brings in view a career for those whose tastes
lead them to training for the practice of scientific
forestry. The demand for such men now cannot be
supplied. Indeed, there are not enough experts in
forestry in the country to supply teachers- for the
schools of forestry and dendrology in which stu
dents may be trained. There is a school at Yale
founded by Mr. Pinchot's family, and there was one
at Cornell in charge of Dr. Fernow. The latter was
dismantled by refusal' of the last Legislature of New
York to make the appropriations needed for its sup
port. This was caused by Mr. Seward Webb, the
owner of large game preserves in the Adirondacks,
which he conceived to be in danger from the forestry
school. Of course the proper answer of New York
to Mr. Seward Webb would have been the acq'ui
sition of his forest game preserves by condemnation,
and the . turning of the land over to the forestry
school for administration. The legislators must an

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 1903.
General Luk Kin, the Chinese rebel leader. Js
meeting with marked success in the progress of his
bloody campaign.' Perhaps General Luk is making
bis ' victorious, way through the war fields on the
strength of his name and will awake some fine day
to find that there is nothing in a riame.
Tn a prize fight in ( -.'and the other day one of
the contestant plug uglies had his jaw broken. Is
it possible for a sympathetic public to imagine a
more fatal accident to a prize fighter? If it had
been an arm or a leg or even his bacfc he would
have suffered no evil consequences in plying his
trade. But to have his jaw broken! That is the
end. ..
The presentation of facts anr figures. before the
State Board of Equalization shows that California
has had a year of healthful growth and increase.
Every community displays prosperity and a com
plete ability to bear its burdens. There is no rea
son, therefore, that San Francisco should be asked
to carry more than her share, which already is
much in the financial : Obligations of California.
THE Government is paying more attention to the
forests of .this State and to a policy fpr their
proper preservation and utilization than is be
stowed upon the timber land of any other part of
the* country.. The reason for" this seems to be that
there is more willing and intelligent co-operation be
tween the" Government- and our people than exists
elsewhere. This is greatly due to the impression
made ' by Mr. Gifford Pinchot during his frequent
contacts- with Californians. -
It is desired" by the people of this State that the
entire control and administration of forests and
forest reserves be put in the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Bureau of Forestry in the Agricultural De
partment.. At present it is 'divided in- the most un
necessary and vexatious way between the Interior
Department, the War Department, the Geological
Survey and the Department of Agriculture. This
causes delay in the formation and operation of a
forest policy which the people will understand and
assist in administering.
Mr. Pinchot is the first scientific forester to secure
the willing co-operation of lumber men, timber land
owners and business men. interested in the economic
uses and profitable conversion of timber to commer-
There is reason to believe that pur diplomatic
representatives in South America will pursue a
systematic campaign to- increase our trade with
our erratic revolutionary southern neighbors.
While .this suggests itself as- a very commendable
scheme there is nothing in .it to swerve us from
conducting our trac'.3 relations' upon a strictly cash
â¢basis- Our experience will guide" us surely and
safely in this . jlicy.

is -whether he wants 4 1. .-;;

remote. Michael Casey's men may or

CHICAGO. Sept.' Lâ Continued good weather
in the Northwest, trgetlier with good- cables,
gave an easy start to the wheat market," De
cember opening %@%c lower at Sl%c. There
was a better feeling later, with k fair demand
from shorts, but free offerings by pit tfaders
kept prices down until the Government report
was received, when the market became firm.
There is little interest In the trading, which
was -the lightest experienced for several weeks
The close was at the top, 80%c for December'
a net gain of %Â©>%c.
The feature In the corn pit was the covering
in the September option by shorts on predic
tions of cold weather Wpst and the bullish
Government .bulletin, which "declared dry,
warm weather urgently needed. There was
but little corn in the market and that little was
quickly absorbed. December closed strong at
an advance of }s@%c at the -high point of the
day. 51 %c, having sold up with few break*)
from 00->i(S50%c.
Oats were quiet, but firm. The strength In
corn, with unfavorable crop reports, helped the
market and the close showed a gain Jn De
cember of %c at -fi^c, after ranging betweeen
3(>c and 36%Â©36%C.
Provisions were 'firm and at times showed
considerable strength. ' Hogs were steady and
there was fairly good support throughout the
list by brokers and packers. September pork
was 5c higher at $12 27%; September lard up
10c at fS 57%. with January at $7 05. Sep
tember ribs. 12%c higher at $7 55; January
closing at ffl C5.

Receipts of summer fruits continue rather
light and are steadily decreasing. The dally
receipts,, however, .are jtill sufficient to sat
isfy the demand. The local demand Was Â«re
tlve yesterday, particularly for-Bartlett Pears
and fine freestone -Pearties. Canning Pe'aches
and Plums were â¢ In limited supply and met
with Drompt sale at steady prices, with occa
sional sales of -.desirabla lots at a premium
over quoted rates. The. canners were also tn
the market .for Bartlett Pears, which were
scarce ant were off erine " $25Â«35 per ton for
choice lots, but were unable to procure any
great amount. Fancy -Apples sold well enough,
but the- market was heavily Â«tocked with
traehy fruit, which dragged at unsteady rates.
Plums In small .packages were also, dull, with:
supplies far in excess of tlie" demand." Good
Figs and Nectarines were in -fair request,
while Quinces and Pomegranates 'were hard
to dispose, of. Table Grapes were' In moderate
receipt and easy; owfng to the absence of de
mand for shipping. Wiri<$ Grapes continued
to drag at prevlo'us prices. Cantaloupes and
Nutmeg Melons were -firmer, receipts being un
usually light and the demand more active
owing to the warm, sunny weather. Water
melons, too, were in brisk demand, and al
thougjj supplies ' were plentiful, prices were
maintained. Receipts of Raspberries came to
hand too late for the regular mornlne trade
and had to be sold at sharply reduced prices.
The bulk of the offerings of Blackberries and
Malinda Strawberries were- poor and soft and
surplus stocks went to the' canners at 2c
and 2&c.per lb, respectively. Huckleberries
were well' cleaned up" and firmer.
Stocks of "Oranges were light and moved oft
fairly well. Lemons and Grape Fruit were In
feood demand oÂ«lng to the warm weather, and
choice Mexican Limes were scare* and firm at
higher prices. Bananas and Pineapples were
unchanged. The steamer Alameda. brought up

RIPLEY MAKES
A QUIET MOVE
Completes His Plans for
Yosemite Connec
tions at Oakdale.
Santa Fe to Build a Line From
Claus to End of Sierra
Railway.
The Santa Fe Company is quietly pre
paring to reach the Yosemite Valley by
way of Big Oak Flat and thereby place
Itself on an equal footing with the South
ern Pacific Company in the competition
for the valley traffic. It has been learned
that its egents have been at work for
nearly a year and have formed alliances
and combinations which will permit tha
achievement of this project at a compar
tlvely small expenditure of money.
A company composed of men in no way
identified with the Santa Fe road will- be
incorporated in a short time for the pur
pose of constructing a new line from Oak
dale, the southern terminus of the Sierra
Railway Company, where it meets the
Southern Pacific line to Claus. a small
station on the San Joaquin Valley road,
above Merced. With this small stretch of
track, less than thirty miles, the Santa
Fe's western system will be brought in
dliect connection with the Sierra Rail
way's main line and over the latter pas
sengers will be transported to the Yo
semite Valley by way of Big Oak Flat,
which is admitted to be one of the best
available routes Into the great scenic re
sort.
Great efforts have been made by the
Santa Fc officials to keep their plans a
stcret, but like the majority of railroad
undertakings this one was soon discov
ered. It has been known for several
weeks by the officials of the Southern
Pacific, who have already begun to throw
obstacles in the way of its accomplish
ment.
RIPLEY ON THE GROUND.
A year ago President Ripley and his as
sociates in the management of the Santa
Fe system foresaw the necessity of gain
ing a firmer foothold in the vicinity of
the Yosemite Park. Vice President Ken
na, the general solicitor of the road, and
Vice President Kendrick joined with' Vice
President Paul Morton in suggesting to
President Ripley the idea of negotiating
with Prince Poniatowski and the Crock
ers, who control the Sierra Railway, for
the purchase outright of that line and
connecting it with tne San Joaquin Val
ley road and it was with that purpose in
view that President Ripley on the occa
sion of his last trip to California quietly
slipped into the Yosemite Valley, coming
out on the Big Oak Flat side, where he
was met by'S.-D. Freshman, assistant
general manager and treasurer of the
Sierra Railway. Freshman; by an ap
pointment arranged between his brother
in-law. T. S. Bullock, the manager of that
road, and President Ripley, through Paul
Morton, who was then in this city, had
a special car in waiting for Ripley at
Jamestown and in It he piloted the head
of the Santa Fe Company over the entire
system of the Sierra Railway Company,
finally landing the president at Oakdale,
where he boarded the Southern Pacific
Company's train and came to this city.
BIDS FOR THE ROAD.
For several days thereafter Ripley and
the representatives of the Sierra Rail
way held conferences in this city, but
the negotiations for the sale of the road
were never effected. Although Ripley
was willing to make the bargain an invit
ing one to the owners of the road, it was
explained by them that they were not in
a position to sell, owing to traffic and
other entanglements with the Southern
Pacific, which were of a very binding
character.
When the Sierra Railway Company
first undertook the construction of its
road from Oakdale to Jamestown it seems
that C. P. Huntlngton, then president of
the Southern Pacific Company, con
ceived the idea that the Crockers and
Prince Ponlatowski were planning a dan
gerous opposition to his line in that sec
tion of the State and in his peculiarly
shrewd manner the famous railroad man
made an open threat that he would par
allel the new line with one of his own by
extending the branch line from Milton to
the terminal point contemplated by the
Crockers and Ponlatowski. As a result
of this threat the heads of the two road3
got together and entered into an under
standing in which it was agreed that the
Huntington corporation would let the in
fant â¢ corporation have the use of rolling
stock and otherwise foster the enterprise
provided Its projectors did not at
tempt .to Interfere with Southern Pacific
business or give aid to a rival corpora
tion.
OBSTACLES IN THE WAY.
Eventually the agreement between the
two roads broadened into a general traf
fic alliance and finally resulted in the
construction of the joint freight and pas
ser depot at Oakdale, which has since
Len used by both concerns There was
nothing in the agreement with Hunting
ton that would prevent the Sierra Rail
way from receiving traffic from another
road at another point on the line. In
fact at that time the proposition of tne
Santa Fe getting that far north was not
dreamed of.
Â¦When these facts were laid before
President Ripley at the conferences in
this city, he carefully weighed them and,
finally left the city for the East, after
promising to give the matters his full
consideration. Later Ripley sent a rep
resentative to the coast and the latter
quietly went over the entire ground lying
within that section of the State bounded
by the Santa Fe line, that of the Sierra
Railway and the National reservation.
Reports of the feasibility of various
plar.s for getting to the Yosemite by way
of Big Oak Flat were carefully consider
ed by President Ripley and his asso
ciates apd finally a scheme to buHd a
branch line from some point on the San
Joaquin Valley road to a convenient
point on the Sierra Railway resulted In
the selection of the route from Claus tt>
Oakdale. Claus is a small station in
Stanislaus County, on the Valley road,
about 28 mi'.es south of Stockton. The
lay of the land between it and Oakdale
is well adapted for railroad building pur
poses, a fact which the Santa Fe people
were quick to learn. 'â¢Â¦-*-:Â¦"
NEW COMPANY IS READY.
The officials had hardly selected, the
route before their agents were at work
getting the necessary men in Tuolumne
and Stanislaus Counties, that is; the
right kind of men to promote a railroad
enterprise, and they were not slow in find
ing them. As stated before, the company
is ready to organize and will probably
file Its papers in a few wee'ks. The rights
of way have already, been secured and
all that remains Is for the Santa Fe peo
ple to give the word and the initiatory
work on the proposed new line will be
inaugurated. ':.'Y:' :; Y -: ' Â¦Â¦ '-'Â¦-'
The new route and Its connections,
aside from the Yosemite Valley traffic
that is guaranteed it. furnishes the Santa
Fe Company an entrance Into a rich
mountain territory, which it will expend
a great deal of money to develop.
The fact that it was prevented from
buying the Sierra Railway Company's
property has not lessened the desire of
the Santa Fe te. acquire it in the least
and the report now is that the line is
destined .to eventually pass Into the con
trol of the transcontinental road. A meet
ing of the directors o. the Sierra Ka!l r
way Company Is to be held, in a few days,
when it iÂ« said that they will vote to
issue another big block of bonds for fur
ther improvements of the road and
rumor has It that the Santa Fe people
have given their assurance that they will
take the greater portion of these securi
ties. This story is common property
among the brokers about town and Is
construed as meaning that the larger line
has in view the absorption of the smaller
one.
"Whether or not it takes the Sierra
Railway, the Santa Fe project between
Claus and Oakdale will not be 'abandon
ed. Yesterday officials of the Southern
Pacific Company were carefully studying
maps of the country through which the
Santa Fe's contemplated road 't trt ex
tend, a fact that is 'suggestive of a pos
sible move on the part of the former
road to build an opposition line from
Oakdale or Milton to the Big Oak Flat.
