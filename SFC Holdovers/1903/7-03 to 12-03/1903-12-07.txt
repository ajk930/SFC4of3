Prince Otto of Windisch-Graetz, his
youthful and immensely wealthy wife,
Princess Elizabeth^ ' Marie, whom he
married only j a year ago, and a pretty
actress ofjthe opera at Prague are cen
tral figures in an extraordinary scandal
that is at this moment rending a half
dozen European courts.
"The Princess, who is a granddaughter
on her father's side of the Emperor of
Austria, and 'on '.her mother's side of
the King of -the. Belgians, is only 20
years old. The royal personage, who
renounced her, rights to the' throne of
Austria in order ; to marry as her .heart
dictated, has had a' harrow escape from
the stigma of a* murderess, for, she did
nothing less than \ shoot and seriously
.wound an actress with ' whom the

but he arrived too late to save Mrs.
Ganka's life.
She -died at 5 o'clock this morning,
and soon afterward the body was
wrapped in blankets ; by Ganka. and
taken to the home of Mrs. Woodruff.
Later they went to the theater and
then to the Saratoga Hotel. Mrs. Ganka
left the parlor -which; her husband, had
engaged and went to the ladies' dress
ing-room. Alarmed by her failure to
return, , Ganka went to seek hia wife.
He found her lying on the floor suffer
ing agonies from* the poison which she
had swallowed. A physician was called.
Both went to Ganka's home, at 334
Jackson boulevard, and while he was
changing his clothes It is believed Mrs.
Ganka purchased the poison at a near
by drug store. \
Peculiar circumstances in connection
with the death of the girl prompted the
arrest of Ganka early in the forenoon.
Priticism was aroused by the late noti
fication to the Coroner and the police.
Detectives from the central station ap
prehended Ganka. The disheartened
and frightened young man was. later
released at the instance of Bemis.
Ganka at the time of his marriage
was a shoe clerk in a local department
store. When 13 years oT age Miss Bemis
eloped with Ganka to St. Joseph. Mich.
Ganka himself was only 20 year* old.
and the affair caused a stir among Mrs.
Ganka's relatives and friends.
There is little doubt that the result- '*
ing unhappiness caused the girl to take
the poison which caused her death this
morning. Letters left by, Mrs. Ganka
bear out this theory.
Last July Ganka and his wife sepa
rated, and later Mrs. Ganka filed a bill
for divorce, alleging cruelty. * After a
visit to her grandmother last evening
Mrs. Ganka called her husband from
his place of employment on the pretext
that their baby wasjll. Then she told
him that nothing was the matter with
the baby, but that she had filed suit
for divorce and wanted to know if he
would contest the case. . Ganka said
that he would not. Then he asked his
wife to go to a theater. She agreed.

This was the homecoming of the

happiest, solution of a shattered ro
mance. Wrapped in blankets and borne
by the young husband and two hotel
employes, the body of the young wom
an was carried from a parlor in . the
Saratoga Hotel to a waiting cab in

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., -Dec 6.â Although
Asa Thomson, Receiver^ of .the Land
Office at La Grande, was acquitted by
the Jury, of the charge of soliciting
bribes, the Government is by no means
through with the case. In the at
tempt to' convict* Thomson- tÂ£e pros
ecution called many witnesses who tes
tified incidentally that they had made
false affidavits in proving up home
stead claims. So frequent and fla
grant was this testimony that . the
court protested informally aY having to
listen to it.
It now develops that special agents
of the Government' were carefully not
ing the evidence and an intimation
of their intention to prosecute the per
jurers and recover the land having
leaked out, the witnesses, are disap
pearing from public view with much
rapidity. Dallas O'Hara. Glen Sallng
and' Ray Burn, three of the offenders,
cannot now be found. Glen Sallng ad
mitted on the -witness stand that he
had sworn to an affidavit claiming that
he had lived for fourteen months on
his claim. 'Then he told the court that
he had never seen the property that
he filed upon. He did not know where
it was and as he expressed it, "It may
be a pile of rocks for all I know."
' ; It ia understood that a complete in
vestigation is to be made relative to
methods pursued by Eastern Oregon
people in. taking up public lands. From
the facts that were brought out during
the Thomson trial, the impression has
gone forth that no small amount of
land has been acquired through means
similar to those shown to have been
employed in this instance. It is inti
mated that the dragnet of Justice will
be thrown around persons more prom
inent than the witnesses in the recent
case. ' â¢ .

The Peking correspondent of the
Morning Post rays: "It is possible
that' the treaty between the United
States and China for the opening of
Moukden and Antung will be ratified
immediately, but I have good reason to
believe that the benefits of the treaty
to foreign trade will be nullified by
Russian influence."
The Dally Mail's correspondent In
Tokio says that, according to a dis
patch from Peking, the Chinese Gov
ernment contemplates the raising of an
army of 100,000 men to protect the
province of Chili In the event of hos
tilities. The Peking dispatch further
states that Hoo Wei Teh, the Chinese
Minister in St. Petersburg, has tele
graphed to Peking that Russia is dis
posed to pursue a peaceful policy.
The Daily Mail's Tientsin correspond
ent fays that 1000 Russians expelled
the Chinese officials from the treasury
at Moukden and installed themselves
in their places.

on the claim of the Japanese Steamship
Company for $75,000 damages against
the Progress for 6inking the Japanese
eteamer Takla Maru in collision on Oc
tober 29. The Russian court exoner
ated the Progress. The Russians claim
that the Japanese courts have no Juris
diction in the case, as the collision oc
curred on the high seas, and threaten
to enter action against the Japanese
Steamship Company and to seize the
company's mail steamer at Vladivo

LONDON. Dec, 7. â The Times* Toklo
correspondent says that, although the
Sei Kui Kay and progressive parties
have definitely agreed to attack the
foreign and financial policy of the Cab

fective when confronted by the firm re
solve of the Ministry not to alter its
policy and also because the parties hold
different views.
Comparing this statement with that
for September 15, 1902, Jt is* observed
that there has been an increase in
number of reporting associations of
441 and a net' Increase of $196,501,053 87
In aggregate resources.
, The specie holdings with the' banks
on ' September 9, 1903, amounted to
$397,556,168, and the deposit liabilities
amounted to $3,863,512,112, on which.le
gal reserve was held of $850,762,184, or
22.02 per cent. The loans and discounts
of national banks reached . their maxi
mum in the history of the, system on
September 9, 1903, when they aggrega
ted $3,481,446,772
Accompanying the Comptroller's re
port is a table giving a detailed state
ment of the resources and liabilities of
all the national banks of the United
â¢States, as shown by the 'five reports of
condition made in response to the call
of the Comptroller. * > ..
During the past year, or more our
banks have successfully stood the very
severe strain due to a great decline in
the market prices of all classes of se
curities and the natural reaction fol
lowing a period of great business ac
tivity and very general speculation, not
only In stocks and securities, but in
many commodities and products. There
have been, considering all the circum
stances, fewer bank failures .. than
might have been expected. Those
which have occurred have been due to
special or local causes or gross mis
management- and in some case most
flagrant dishonesty on the part of the
bank officials. As a rule the reports of
the bank examiners show the national
banks to own very few stocks and al
most none of a very speculative char
acter. The bank reports show total
loans by all the banks of $1,372,697,751
on collateral security. These loans are
mostly on good classes of stocks and
.bonds well margined, and as far as
they are concerned there is less cause
for concern than there has been at any
time for several years. The loans are
readjusted on a lower basis of prices
than before and are as a whole as am
ply or more amply margined than they
were on the higher prices. It is due to
the banks to say that the way they
have handled their business and met
this decline is an evidence of strength
and careful management.
That there has not been more
trouble with the banks and disturb
ance of business generally during- this
period of declining prices Is also a
great evidence of the confidence of our
people In all our money and currency.
If there had been- the slightest doubt as
to our monetary standard or as to any
of our currency in circulation we' might
have had a most severe and far-reach
ing crisis. That we have not only es
caped this, but that there has not been
greater disturbance of general business,
shows what progress and improve
ments there have been in all our bank
ing, financial and monetary affairs
since they were last subjected to se
rious strain of this kind.
In the Comptroller's report for 1902
a recommendation was made that the
national banks be allowed to issue a
portion of their notes uncovered by
the deposit of bonds. This seems the
most simple and practical, as well as
the safest way, to introduce some
elasticity into our bank note circula
tion and the same recommendation is
renewed.
This still further emphasizes the one
serious defect in our system that the
variation in the volume of our cur
rency, instead of responding to the de
mand for currency, depends on the
market price of bonds. Until our. bank
note circulation is made automatically
to respond to the demand for currency
for daily cash transactions, without
reference to the price of bonds, it will
never be entirely satisfactory or ef
ficient.
The most notable fact in regard to
the national bank circulation is the
great increase in Its volume, which
reached $421,222,489 on September 5.
1903, the largest amount which has
ever been in circulation. It is 55.43
per cent of the maximum possible cir
culation, which is higher than this
percentage has been since 1886. -This
increase in the volume of circulation
has been largely due to special efforts
on the part of the Treasury Depart
ment. It has been feared during the
past few months that when the de
mand came for currency to move the
crops this year it might produce more
than the usual disturbance In the
money market. That this demand has
been met with less disturbance and less
advance in rates of interest than for
several years past is doubtless due
largely, among other causes, to this
increase in bank note circulation.
It is further of interest to note that
Just as the circulation was reaching
its "maximum" and the "demand for
bonds had advanced their price, the
deposit of lawful money to retire cir
culation, which for some months has
been light, suddenly increased, and
during the latter half of September
applications were received taking ' up
the maximum of $3,000,000 per month
for the months of September, October,
November and December.
The national bank act does not suf
ficiently protect the rights of minority
stockholders on the question of exten
sion of expiring charters, as explained
in detail in the report for 1902, and
the Comptroller urges that action be
taken on this important matter for the
better protection of minority or dis
senting shareholders.
, WASHINGTON. Dec. 6. â In his an
nual report, prepared for transmission
to Congress, William B.- Ridgeley,
Comptroller of the j Currency, again
renews the , recommendations con
tained in his report for 1902 for legis
lation in regard to liquidation and con
solidation of national banks and exten
sion of corporate existence. The nec
essary method of effecting a consoli

Is inconvenient and cumbersome, and
in the interest of better and more ef

Of equal importance with the general
staff act in its relation to the general
military efficiency of the country is the
act to promote the efficiency of the
militia, approved January 21, 1903, sup
plemented by an appropriation of $2,
000,000 In the army appropriation act of
March 2, 1903. Congress declared the
National Guard organizations to, be the
organized militia, and provided for call
ing them Into the service of the United
States whenever required for the'eon
stitutional purposes of repelling inva
sion, suppressing insurrection and ex
ecuting the laws of the Union.
The act provides that the organiza
tion, armament and discipline of the
organized militia shall be the same as
that prescribed for the regular army.
It authorizes- participation by the or
ganized militia in Joint maneuvers, with
the regular army, and provid.es that in
such case the organized militia so par
ticipating shall receive the same pay,
subsistence and transportation as Is
provided by . law for the officers a,nd
men of the regular army, to be paid out
of the regular appropriations for the
supporf of the army. It provides for
furnishing aid , to separate State en T
campments of the militia by allowing
out of an annual appropriation of $1,-

CRUISER FLORA HOLDS
FAST, TO THE BOOKS
The general* plan contemplates that
every subject requiring Investigation
and study shall be worked out first by
the officers assigned to the appropriate
division and section of the staff, and,
when of sufficient importance, shall
then be considered by a genoral staff
council composed of the three general
officers of the corps and the heads of
the three divisions, and shall then be
acted upon by the chief or staff, or
laid before the Secretary of War by
him with his recommendation. It Is
gratifying to report that the new sys
tem of control has been accompanied
by most harmonious* effort, and 'cheer
ful good will on the part Of the mem
bers of the general staff, the chiefs of
all the War Department bureaus, and
the officers of the army at large.
Following the same line of policy
which led to the organization of the
general staff, the Secretaries of War
and the Navy entered into an arrange
ment, with the approval of the Presi
dent, for a joint Army and Navy Board.
The common understanding ond mu

this board to bring about, may be made

great public importance.

President, who, acting under Ihe di

retary of "War representing him, should
have supervision not only or all troops
of the line, but of the special staff and
supply departments which had there
tofore reported directly to the Secretary
of War; and it created for the assist

forty-four officers, who were relieved

CALI/ BUREAU, 1406 G j STREET,
N. W., WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. â The
annual report of Secretary of War
Root, Just made public, shows that on
October 15, 1903, the actual strength of
the regular arrriy was 3081 officers and
55.500 enlisted men, distributed as fol
lows :
On the 15th of /October, 1903, the
American troops in the Philippines con
sisted of 843 officers^ and 14,667. enlisted
men. General G<orge *\V. Davis, the
division commander until the 25th *of
July, has reported that the number can
be still further reduced, and Secretary
Root agrees with that opinion. - It is
not desirable,- however, to '. make any
further reduction until the construction
of barracks and quarters in the United
States has made further progress.
There are also ninety-nine officers and
4805 enlisted men of the Philippine
scouts. There is not at present much
occasion for the use of American troops
outside of the Moro country, but the
moral effect of their presence Is un
doubtedly salutary.

ALASKAN TELEGRAPH LINES.
Concerning Alaskan telegraph lines
the report says: : - -,
The Signal Corps has continued the. Work of
telgraphlc construction in Alaska with its
customary energy. The system provided for
by the act of Congress of May 26. 1000, has
now been completed. It consists of 1T40 miles
of telegraph line; of which 1486 are land and
254 ccble lines. It connects Fort St. Michael,
ond the south shore of Norton Sound with
Fort Davis mid Nome City on the north shore,
and running easterly from St. Michael to. the.
valley of the Yukon, passes up that Val
ley to . Fort Gibbon and . Rampftst, and
from Fort Gibbon passes up the valleys of
the Tanana ond Goodpasture rivers to Fort Eg- ;
bert and Eagle City; thence running southerly
across the" divide r between the Tanana
and the, Copper River. It runs' through
the Coupe r. River country to Valdez on
Prince William* Sound. A separate cable of
120 mll^JR connects Hkas-vvay at the head of
Lynn Canal with Halnes Mission and Juneau.
Under the' appropriation of March 2, , 1903,
for the construction and maintenance of a sub
marine cable for connecting the headquarters
Department of the Columbia with military
garrisons in Southeastern Alaska, the entire
Cable of about 1300 miles in length has been
manufactured in the United States and deliv
ered on the Pacific Coast. Two hundred and
ninety-two miles, 'connecting .Tunoau with
Sltka, have been laid and are In operation.
The remainder of thÂ« cable, sufficient to cover
the distance between Seattle and Sltka, esti
mated at 070 miles, is at Seattle ready to be
laid as soon as conditions of navigation permit.
As the cable was manufactured on the Atlan
tic Coast and its great weight practically pro
hibited transporation by rail, it was necessary
to aend it around Cape Horn. Only an un
fortunate delay in ' the commercial steamer
carrying part of the shipment prevented the
completion of the undertaking before the win
ter storms Interrupted the work.
With the completion of this work next
epring we shall have two separate , telegraph
systems, one In Northwestern Alaska of about
10iÂ»0 miles, and the other a cable system of
about 1400 miles, connecting all Important
points in Southeastern Alaska with the tele-'
graph system of the United States. | There
will romain a break between the, two systems
of about BC5 mile*, which should be closed, by'
a cable from Sitka to 'Valdez; ' ." * '. â¢ , Â¦

era to prove a statement made by a
stranger living in some far-away point
of the Union, but the Indorsement of
neighbors, friends and citizens . is the
best of proof; no better evidence. can be
had.
J. A. Kell, retired, of 605 Broadway,
Â¦ays: "For a year or more my back was
weak and ached continually, not severely
enough to lay me up. but It certainly was
very disagreeable. I knew the cause of
my trouble from the action and condition
of the kidney secretions, but what to do ,
to stop it was a mystery. I came to Cal-
ifornia in 1S53; the greater part of my
life has been spent In mining, an occu-
pation decidedly hard on the constitu-
tion, and when attacks of kidney com-
plaint affect a man it Is more difficult
than ordinary to remove. Doan's Kidney
Pills certainly stopped my backache. It
is now some seven or eight months since
I stopped the treatment, and at the pres-
ent time I have not a sign of anything
wrong with my kidneys."

crop shows splendid results.
Stories told by Bonier respecting his
movements on the day of the murder
conflict with those told by Mrs. Louis
Lindholm, his housekeeper, and rela
tives and neighbors of the old couple.
BUFFALO, N. Y., Dec. 6.â The coils
are tightening around Charles Bonier,
the aged suspect being held for the
murder of the Frehrs, the old couple
whose mutilated and decomposed bod
ies were found last week buried under
the barn of their home here.
"Even assuming," said Chief of De
tectives' Taylor to-day, "that Bonier
cannot be ( convicted of murdering the
Frehrs, we could, on indictments based
on his own confessions of three dif
ferent felonies, forgery, attempted brib
ery and impersonating another in
swearing to a legal paper, send him to
prison for the rest of his natural life."
Circumstances Point Strongly to Him
as the Slayer of the
Frehrs.

uated in that State, from Ramon Ala
zar, the consideration was $100,000

â¢The urgent duty of carrying out
measures of isolation and disinfection
the university has performed through
its agencies, the professor of hygiene
and the Students' Guild. Doing this
necessarily gives the matter publicity
beyond its due. as the cases are not nu
merous enough to form an epidemic or
to cause seriws alarm."
As to the rumor that the university
would be closed or a quarantine forced
Dr. Jordan said emphatically that
neither would be a result of the present
situation. In his statement Dr. Jordan
says:
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. 6â
The scare resulting from the finding of
several cases of diphtheria among stu
dents in the university seems to be
blowing over. There is a general feel
leg that the situation la not as serious
as was at first reported and that the
authorities have do&e everything to
hold the disease in check-
Two suspected cases were sent to the
detention hospital to-day. Two mem
bers of the class of 1905. room-mates in
Encina Dormitory, were found to be
suffering with ulcerated throats and to
have symptoms of diphtheria. They
ere George R. Stevens of Benlcia and
Kovrard H. Chandler of Se'.ma. Stev
er.s is the president of his class and
well known in the university. Whether
these men really have diphtheria or not
will taks several days for the doctors
to decide. Of the four men who have
been held within bounds, suspected of
having the disease, three have develop
ed new symptoms which tend to make
the diagnostician believe that genuine
diphtheria will result.
Both President Jordan and Dr. Snow
eald this afternoon that there was no
cause fcr widespread alarm as all of
the suspected sources of contagion
were under control and everything was
being dene to minimize the danger to
the students.
BpecltJ DUpaica to TaÂ» CalL
It will not be possible to pass the
general appropriation bills before the
recess is taken and some of the public
leaders hope to accomplish this. The
clerical work on the legislative and ex
ecutive appropriation bills has been ad
vanced to a point where their early
consideration by the committee can be
undertaken. It ls^ expected .that Hem
enway, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, will publish the work of his
committee as rapidly as possible. ' â¢
Pending reports from committees*, the
House will take up such matters as
may be brought before it for consid
eration by unanimous consent, but the
real . work will not begin until com
mittees have had time' to act on meas
ures referred to them. It is under
stood by the members of the House
that the President's message will be
sent to Congress to-morrow. Â¦ Its read
ing will be the principal event in the
House. It is expected that the Christ
mas recess will be taken about De
cember 22 and that on the assembling
after New Year the House will get to
work in deep earnest preparatory to as
early a final adjournment as possible.
The death of Representative Burke of
Pennsylvania will be announced to the
House, perhaps to-morrow, and the res
olution adopted providing for an ad
journment as a mark of respect.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â The Senate
to-morrow will pass so quietly from
the extraordinary session into the first
re&ular session of the Fif ty-e7ghth Con
gress that the change will scarcely .be
realized. In accordance with the terms
of Saturday's adjournment resolution
the hour of meeting will be 11:30 a. ~m..
when the usual morning business will
be transacted. At 12 o'clock Senator
Frye as president pro tem will an
nounce that, as the hour for convening
the regular session has arrived, the
special session shall stand adjourned.
The regular routine of business then
will be proceeded with as if .there had
been no interruption.
The Cuban reciprocity bill will be
taken up at the conclusion of the morn
ing hour, and it will continue to be the
regular business before the Senate to
the exclusion of all other matters, ex
cept those of a routine character, un
til December 18, when a vote will be
taken. A number of Senators have
prepared speeches in opposition to the
bill, but none of these will speak.
After Senator Cullom, who is in charge
of the measure, makes a statement in
support of it, whicfi he will do as soon
as possible, after the convening of the
regular session, either Senator Teller
or Morgan will follow in opposition, and
they in turn by other Senators who
will object to the bill. The understand
ing in the Senate is that the Presi
dent's message will be received Mon
day.
The House will convene in regular
session to-morrow. Much has been
gained by the special session and the
work of the regular session will bead
vanced fully two weeks, as ordinarily
it requires the time up to the adjourn
ment for the holiday recess to complete
the organization of the House. Now it
only remains for the committees, the
last of which was completed yester
day, to meet and organize, when the
House will be ready to proceed at once
with general legislative work.
Adjournment Will Be Fol
lowed by Convening of
Regular Assembly.

Biclory Has Prcvei That Dandruff Za
Caused ty a Germ.
Science is doing wonders these days in
medicir.e as well as In mechanics. Since
Adam lived, the human race* has been
troubled with dandruff, for which no hair
preparation has heretofore proved a suc-
cessful cure until Xewbro's Herpicide
was put on the market. It is a scientific
preparation that kills the germ that
makes dandruff or scurf by digging into
the scalp to get at the root of the hair,
where it saps the vitality, causing- itch-
ing scalp, fallir.e hair and finally bald-
ness. Without dandruff hair must grrow
. luxuriantly. It is the only destroyer of
dandruff. Sold by leading druggists.

Albert Titus, 14 years of age, living
with his mother at 1304 Lyon street,
was driving his cousin, Miss Lillian P.
Crommelin, in a buggy yesterday after
noon along Bush street when a colt
bounded from a yard near Scott street
and frightened the horse. Albert ' is
considered to be a good driver for his
age, but the animal became unmanage
able and bolted. At the corner of Bush
and Fillmore the horse dashed into Uie

kept by Lorenzo Adams and both Al
bert and Miss Crommelin were pitched
on the horse as it fell. They escaped
with bruises, but the ' buggy was

LONDON, Dec. 6.â With a stronger
belief that the Bank of England will
not find a necessity for raising Its rate
In the near future, the Stock Exchange
last week was swayed chiefly by the as
pects of the Russo-Japanese" crisis.
â¢ After the week had opened the report
received by the Associated Press from
Paris that a practical basis of agree
ment had been arrived at by. Russia
and- Japan, caused a revivalof hopes
for peace which was strongly reflected
In the advance in the price of Japanese
bonds. Russians., however; did not
show wide fluctuations.
The sale- of the warships Constitution
and LIbertad to England by Chile im
proved the price of Chilean bonds owing
to the belief that the amount received
for' the vessels may avert the necessity
for Chile: to raise a loan . abroad. The
market for American securities again
shared considerably in the general re
vival of business, the recovery being
materially .'assisted by the spurt in steel

far as he was concerned tha published
report that a compromise had been ef
fected whereby no ship subsidy bill
would be urged at this session, but
a commission of Investigation _x>n the
subject created instead, was erroneous.
He added:. * W^HSIO^f
"1 know of no such compromise or
agreement and I venture to] say that
nothing of the kind has been arranged.
A single Individual came to me Fri
day morning and handed me vhat pur
ported to be a bill for the creation of
a commission. I have not read it.' Â»I
merely glanced over It. I do not know
who agreed to it. or who drew it, or
anything connected with it beyond
what I have stated, and I am quite
sure that If any agreement, compromise
or arrangement had been made by any
body having authority or official rela
tion to Congress, I should have known
of It."

An , immense audience was In evi
dence to hear Dr. Alexander J. Mclvor-
Tyndall last night on "Proofs of Im
mortality." Dr. Mclvor-Tyndall has
been here for six months past, and the
interest he has awakened in the ab
struse problems of metaphysics has-de
veloped into a desire to know more of
the philosophy as well as the phenom
ena of the invisible forces of the hu
man mind. The lecture last night was
one of the most interesting of the many
interesting lectures given by the fa
mous student of psychology, and the
audience showed Its appreciation by the
closest attention to , every word. Dr.
Mclvor-Tyndall paid a high tribute to
the* work done by materialistic science,
but said that it is / to religious . faith
rather 1 than materialistic science that
we are indebted for our proofs of im
mortality. He gave it as hia opinion
that when the "twentieth century com
plexity ! of thought shall have become
concrete we will find that religious faith
and scientific proofs will unite oh the
question of immortality." The lecture
was followed by v some marvelously in
tricate and Interesting phenomena of
the mind and soul. Next Sunday even

his subject ."Our Common Birthright."

Guards on the dock at Fort Alcatraz

o'clock by loud cries for help coming,
apparently, from \he bay just south
east of the island. An alarm was
given at once, and the Government
steamer General McDowell was dis
patched to the scene from whence the
sounds came. ,
Several pleasure yachts which hap
pened to be in the vicinity also
hastened to give assistance, and a
thorough search was made of that en
tire locality. When the news reached
San Francisco a 'number of launches
were Bent to the scene, but nothing
could be f.und. The tide had Just
started to ebb at the time of the ac
currence, so if the persons wbo raised
the cry were at the mercy of the waves
they were carried In shore, -and have
not been taken out to sea.
The man In charge or the scow at
Blossom Rock heard no sound and saw
nothing. The night was clear and the
moon at its brightest, and there was a
complete absence of fog. The wind was
blowing strong from the west at the
time.

a. few hours.', illness. Yesterday morn
insv while preparing, for a ride with
his wife to* the park, he suddenly com
plained of a. severe pain in. his head.
He was assisted to his. bed and became
unconscious. Dr. - Hirschfelder, who
was summoned, pronounced the case of
his patient as hopeless, as- it was ap
parent that an artery of the brain had
been ruptured. ' .,
Dr. Gonzalez was' a native of Cali
fornia, 5& years of age, and is' survived
by his wife and a daughter by a for
mer .marriage. He was a man of con
siderable wealth and was the founder
of the town of Gonzales. In ' drawing
up the' incorporation papers, of . the lat
ter a mistake was made in the spoiling
of the name, which, however, the doc
tor never undertook to correct. Among

Dr. Gonzalez Passes Away.
The body was identified by P. F.
Foley and J. A. Davis, workmen em
ployed in the Southern Pacific shops
near by, and later by the dead man's
son-in-law, J. E. Cary, at the Morgue.
The dead body of Michael Walsh, an
aged man," "who lived at 200 Utah
street^ was found beside the Southern
Pacific tracks at Fifteenth and Â¦Harri
son streets last night. 1 The unfor
tunate man had evidently been killed
by a passing train.
The body was discovered at 7 o'clock
by A. Dayton, a plumber, living at
1704 Harrison street. Dayton 1 was
passing up the track with a lady friend
and noticed a dark object lying on the
ground beside the track. He said noth
ing for fear of frightening his compan
ion, but returned at "10 o'clock and
made sure that it was a dead man. He
notified Officer Weatherford of the
Mission station and the Morgue wagon
removed the body.
Foul play was at first suspected, but
when the man's right arm and back
were found to be broken this theory
was abandoned.
Walsh had evidently been killed by
the 6:30 p. m. outbound train, as he
was found lying by the track over
which that train passes. He was a
soap seller and leaves three daugh
ters, Mrs. J. E. Cary, Miss Mamie

A number of the leading real estate
men are endeavoring to perfect plans
for organizing a real estate associa
tion in this city. A meeting was hsld
last week in the offices of Woodward,
Watson & Co., at which a committee
consisting of J. T. Bell, A. H. Breed and
Harry Belden. presented an original
draft of a proposed constitution for the
government of the association. It was
proposed to give the new organization
the name of the Oakland Real Estate
Association. Further plans will be dis
cussed at a meeting to be held- next
Wednesday evening at the same place.
Following are statements from some
of the local real estate dealers:
Henry A. Dodge of the firm of S. M. Bode*
8c Son â Oakland la cominc to the attention of
outside manufacturers, , business men, buyers
and speculators as never before. In San Fran
cisco fortunes are constantly being: made by
buying and Belling business property. In Oak
land the constant growth of population and the
Increase cf business la produclne similar op
portunities of Investment, and many buyers
from San Francisco and eluewhere are observ
ing the fact and an increasing- number are
taking advantage of It with profit.
In past years Oakland's proximity to San
Francisco has been both a detriment and a
benefit. Now a very email, and I am clad to
see decreasing-, proportion of trading is done
Jn San Francisco by Oakland people, and Oak
landVa business enterm-ises ara multiplying:
and enlarging in a very gratifying way. That
many San Francisco merchants are realizing;
this is evidenced by the number of fine, stores
which they conduct In Oakland . as branch
stores without anything to Indicate that.they
are "branch" stores. Because of this increased
business property values are goinr up and
will continue to go up.
Itesidence property value* depend upon their
nearness to the center of business. ThereforÂ©
Oakland residence properties have a double
advantage In being near two bustneps centers.
San Francisco, the money center of California,
and Oakland, a city which experts believe to
offer golden opportunities for money-making.
With the new key route ferry line boat* in
operation Oakland is only twenty-flve minute*
in point of time from San Francisco, and as
there are seven round trips made by first-class
and rapid passenger boats each hour residence
properties "here are aa accessible to San Fran
cisco business men as are many of the resi
dence sections of San Francisco. These are
the reasons why Oakland is coming under the
favorable notice of so- many outsiders who
are ready and anxious to invest their money
La real estate where It will surely yield large
Numerous Oakland business men have very
wisely Invested In 8an Francisco real estate to
their advantage, but those same men are also
dealing successfully In Oakland realty In the
direct line of growth of our city.' The point
I wish to make is that Oakland real estate
offers a good opportunity to the wise man
and is worthy of the careful study and action
of men who see things In advance. Â¦
Lavroance Real Estate Companyâ There has
been 'but little change In realty conditions dur
ing the last week, but compared with this time
ait year the market Is far more active. We
have Inquiries every day for desirable home
sites in all parts of the city, especially In the
northern portion and in East Oakland.
From present indications It is only a ques
tion of a few years when there will be a large
number ofÂ» manufacturing plants located along
the water front. The opening up of the Orien
tal market will make It necessary to establish
all kinds of factories on the. Pacific Coast, and
from Its location and natural advantages as
well as from the crowded conditions In San
Francisco, Oakland is the city where most of
tbeÂ»Â« enterprises will locate.
There Is no doubt that the business center
of Oakland is rapidly expanding. One of the
largest printing establishments in the city Is
contemplating the erection of a three-story bus
iness block at Twelfth and Harrison streets
and we have had several sites as far west as
Jefferson street. â¢ Â¦ ' _
Oakland is awakening from a Rip van Win
kle sleep and the next five years will witness
greater progress in this city than did the last
twenty years. . - *
Frank J. Woodward of the firm of Woodward
& Watson â The conditions of the market . at
present are most favorable. Residence prop
erty in all parts of the city Is In great de
mand, but mose especially that located con- 1

The business district Is expanding very rap-
Idly north and west. The district bounded by
Fourteenth and Twentieth, and Broadway and
Jefferson street seems most favored at present,
although we have had a number of Inquiries
during the past month for business sites nearer
the business center. There is one thing, how
ever, which, if accomplished, will stimulate the
Oakland real estate market more than any
other one thing that I know of. - That is the
improvement of Oakland's principal thorough
fares. Some of the streets are In such a con
dition that they are a veritable black eye to
the city. -â¢-..â¢
People desiring to invest In real estate natur
ally prefer to be located on streets Â¦ which are
in good repair.
Conditions in the local realty market
have changed but little In the last
week, although there Is naturally a
slight depression, owing to the proxim
ity of the holiday season. Dealers re
port an advance of 5 to 10 per cent over
the prices of the same period last year,
with nearly double the number of In
quiries for all kinds of property. AH
the real estate men agree that houses
to rent are very scarce, and it is prac
tically impossible to secure stores In
desirable locations.

Stahlbohm evidently thought he was
still driving, for he was seated upright,
with blankets around his knees and the
remnants of the lines still outstretched
In his hands. When Engineer Bellinger
shook him out of his stupor he angrily
accused the trainmen of stealing his
cap and his horses, and had to be held
from fighting them. Stahlbohm was
uninjured.
HAMMOND. Ind., Dec. 6.â Farmer
Charles Stahlbohm, proprietor of a
roadhouse near this city, will not care
to duplicate the thrilling experience he
had last night while driving home from
Dyer, where he had been buying stock.
He had met too many friends in Dyer,
and as he with his team neared the
Monon Railway, fifteen miles south of
here, he did not notice a fast freight
train until it was upon him. The train
killed both horses and made kindling
wood of the wagon.
Stahlbohm fared miraculously. He
was thrown upon the engloe pilot, and
so tightly had he grasped his lines that
he still held parts of them, as well as
the whip, when the train pulled Into
Hammond. There he was found by the
engineer, who did not know of the col
lision.

LOUIS WORMSER
DIES SUDDENLY
IN NEW YORK
BOY SERIOUSLY WOUNDED.
Skelly, after the capture, took the
wounded boy to the Central Emerg
ency Hospital. The little fellow gave
the name of George King and his resi
dence'at 157 Clara street. He is em
ployed at the Postal Telegraph Com
pany and is 15 years of age.
Dr. Murphy, who examined the lad's
wound, found that the bullet from the
policeman's pistol had struck the boy
on the right side of the abdomen,' en
tered the abdominal cavity and found
exit above the pelvis. The surgeon
says that the wound . is dangerous . but
not necessarily fatal.
The boy's story is that he and a com
panion, Willie Sullivan ; of 149 Clara
street, on hearing a shot ran to the
scene of the trouble. He; had gone. but
a few feet when^he told his boy friend
that he had been shot and then fell to
the sidewalk.
Howard was taken to the hospital
a few minutes later to be treated for
a bullet- wound of the left leg. .For
a while he. exhibited a spirit of brav
ado and loudly proclaimed. his sorrow
for not "getting the: officer first."-
He readily admitted- that he <had
stood up the saloon single-handed and
said that It was. only Â¦ a piece of bad
luck .that he did not make good his
escape. . Howard said that the name
he gave was not his right â¢ one fand
hjnted quite strongly that his occupa
tion" was that of a" crook and that this
hold-up was not his first one. '
After awhilev he -seemed to realize
that he was talking too freely and ; he
refused to say anything further except
to express sympathy for the wounded
boy and to declare that he, was willing
to pay. the penalty for ; his crime. . f
Howard was taken to the Central po
lice station and V charged with robbery.
Skelly turned at once, only to be con
fronted by the prostrate man's threat
that he would shoot if his pursuer ap
proached nearer. To make good his
threat Howard pointed his revolver at
the officer, and before Skelly could
draw his weapon Howard was on his
feet and running toward the scene of
his crime. Howard dodged into a door
way and Skelly, knowing that it was
but temporary shelter for his man,
jumped into a doorway a few feet
away. Soon Howard sprang out and
made a bold attempt to escape. Skelly
called at him to halt, and upon How
ard's refusal fired at him. The bullet
took effect in the robber's left leg, but
he kept on running. Skelly fired an
other shot. The crowd that gathered
informed the officer that a boy. had
been seriously wounded by one of the
bullets.
Skelly picked up the youth who had
fallen to the sidewalk, and placing
him in the care of a bystander, con
tinued in pursuit of his game.
Policeman Tom Murphy, on turn
ing the corner of Fourth and Howard
streets, heard the shot, and ran to
the scene. As he turned the corner
he ran into the robber, and pointing
his pistol at his head, ordered him
to surrender. The robber gave up
Instantly, saying,. "Don't shoot; ' I'll
quit," and then sank to the sidewalk, a
bullet wound in his leg overcoming
him. Murphy handcuffed his
and took him to the South- Station.
During a running flght with the
crook the policeman fired two Â¦hots.
One of them took effect in the robber's
leg. Another, unfortunately, seriously
wounded George King, 15 years of age,
who was turning the corner of Fourth
and Howard fetreets as the fusillade
was going on.
At about 10:30 o'clock last night a
man, who afterward gave his name as
Harry Howard, entered Little's saloon
on the north side of Howard street, a
few doors below Fourth, and demanded
that the six men who were In the place
give up their coin. His demand was
emphasized by the flourish of a re
volver, and his tone and manner made
such an impression on the men that
they lost no time In complying.
Howard had his face covered with a
white handkerchief and as he accepted
the valuables from each of his victims
he bade them not to make a move upon
penalty' of death. After coolly reliev
ing the six men of their coin, amount
ing in all to a trifle more than 520, the
daring -desperado backed out of the
place after, again warning them to
make no outcry.
Before entering the saloon Howard
accosted a boy named George Schroeff
ell, who was standing in the doorway,
and, giving the lad ten cents, sent
him away.
Once on the street the robber took
to his heels and ran rapidly down How
ard street toward Third. He had "gone
but a few feet when he was met by
Officer Charles Skelly. Before the po
liceman could halt him, Skelly heard
a heavy jingle of coin In the man's
pockets and, realizing that something
was wrong, gave chase. He called upon
the man to stop, but the demand, only
put more speed to the fleeing thief.
Suddenly Howard fell and the police,
man, who was close behind him and
going at a rapid gait, passed him.
THREATENS TO SHOOT.
After holding up six men in a saloon
on Howard street, just below Fourth, a
deiperate, lone robber while trying to
make his escape was brought to earth
by a brave police officer and Is now
locked safely in the tanks at the City
Prison.

Fifty horses were burned to death
at midnight last night in a fierce fire
on Seventh street, between Bryant and
Brannan. Two stables and a ware
house were almost destroyed and a
tile 'warehouse was damaged. The
total loss Is In the neighborhood of
$50,000.
The flre started in the stable of
Charles Madison and soon the ware
house of the San" Francisco Com
pressed Hay Company and the stable
of Frank Munson & Co. were afire.
These three buildings were almost de
stroyed and* the tile warerooms of
Gladding, McBean & Co. were slightly
damaged.
The origin of the fire Is unknown,
but it is thought some one who was
Bleeping in the barn dropped a lighted
cigar or cigarette Btump in a pile 'of
hay. It took but a few moments for
the blaze to spread and when the va
rious flre companies arrived on the
scene three of the buildings were en
veloped in flames and smoke and the
fourth was threatened with destruc
tion.
The firemen at once^ turned their at
tention to rescuing the horses from the
stables of Munson & Co. and Charles
Madison. In all more than thirty ani
mals were taken out, but fifty per
ished.
The firemen did excellent work and
kept the fierce flames from spreading
to many adjoining dwellings. Several
hundred tons of hay belonging to Mun
son & Co., Madison and the Compressed
Hay Company was destroyed, but the
damage in the storehouse of Gladding,
McBean & Co. was Blight.
A year ago four large stables and
warehouses on the same site were
burned to the ground. Many horses
were lost at that time, and the flre is
supposed to have started in the same
way as that of last night.
AIÂ»EX. Arabia, Dec. 6.â Lieutenant
Commander Grabau, an Italian officer,
commanding an armed dhow, landed a
party of friendly natives at Darbe, So
mallland, Africa, and ordered the Ital
ian flag hoisted on the fort. The com
mandant of the fort refused to permit
the order to be carried out unless it
had the sanction of the Sultan.
Lieutenant Commander Grabau there
upon gave the commandant two hour3
in which to obey the order and, at the
expiration of that time, the command
ant not having complied, nred upon th9
fort. Tho fort replied with shell, kill
ing Grabau.
The dhow then put to Â«ea and was
picked up by nn Italian cruiser, which
landed the officer's bo<ly here.
The news that ' the 450 . Colombian
soldiers had threatened to attack Colon
and kill all Americans was'made known
by Senor Melendez at. about 12:30 on
Wednesday. The Nashville â¢ was at
once signaled' that K the presence of-
Captain Hubbard < was needed 1 on shore.'
Fifteen, minutes later 'he landed in
a small boat , and ;the, situation was
explained to him. His pians were
formed at once. No ; time was . to be
lost, for serious fighting could
be expected "in â¢ an . hour. ; Forty
men and two 'one-pounder guns from
the Nashville were as big a j force ;as
could be spared, and .were landed and
sent to the freight house of the Panama
Railroad.' This force was in command
of Lieutenant Commander Wiltsea.
All entrances' to ,the freight house,
were fortified by bales of cotton and
other available merchandise. One gun
was mounted to 'command the approach
at the rear of the * building, while the
other 1 was set upon a. fiat car at the
main entrance in front, to command
that side.
All this was done by 2 o'clock. But
the Colombians did not carry out their
threat. They cquld be seen in small
parties moving about the streets, but
the majority of them stayed in their
barracks. It was agreed between Cap
tain Hubbard and Colonel Torres on
Wednesday night that each should
withdraw his troops.
Althought the 450 troops from the
Cartagena were landed, they were un
able to obtain transportation to Pana
ma. Colonel Torres succeeded In get
ting the railway officials to have a
train made up to carry them to Pan
ama, but In the meantime . Captain
Hubbard, acting upon the obligation
of the United States to protect traffic
across the isthmus, gave orders that no
troops whatever should be moved over
the railroad. This deprived Colonel
Torres of all chance of going to the
relief of his leaders, who had preceded
the troops to Panama.
On Wednesday morning the news of
the arrest of 'Amaya and Tovar was
brought to Colon and then came in
formation that Governor Obaldia had
been made . a prisoner, and that the
revolution; had been successful. '
Proflro Melendez, then agent of the
Panama junta and later Governor of
Colon, approached Colonel .Torres and
tried to- negotiate with him for the
quiet withdrawal of the troops. His
efforts were futile.. The Colombians
would not agree, arid;-. shortly before
noon they 'threatened to attack Colon
and kill every "American '- here . unless
Generals Amaya and .Tovar, were liber
ated by 2 o'clock that. afternoon. This
at once put serious aspect upon the sit
uation. . r Â« â¢
Meantime the â¢ firm that generally
supplied .water to the government re
fused to furnish the^ captain of the Car
tagena, fresh water'f or his boilers un
less an old bill against the government
was paid, and the captain quietly sailed
away and never returned...
NASHVILLE LANDS MARINES.
COLON, Republic of Panama, Nov.
23. â There were two days at Colon
when a few Americans under the com
mand of Lieutenant Commander Wilt
sea, U. S. N., faced a desperate chance
and looked It calmly In the face. On
November 2 the United States gunboat
Nashville, Captain John Hubbard,
came into Colon. Her presence was
welcome on both sides of the Isthmus
to every, man concerned in the brew-
Ing secession movement, but the sur
face observer of affairs saw nothing to
make her coming necessary. Appar
ently there was no revolution and
traffic over the Panama railroad did
hot appear to be threatened.
The next morning (Tuesday) the Co
lombian gunboat -Cartagena unexpect
edly steamed Into Colon . with 450 Co
lombian troops on board. This news
was flashed over the wires to the other
side and the whole isthmus awakened.
At once there was nervous excitement
in Panama,: young men carried mes
sages hurriedly through the /streets;
secret consultations were held; wild
plans were discussed; some of the con
spirators were for acquitting, declar
ing there was no chance for success
with 450 Colombian soldiers in Colon,
and .that the opportunity had been
lost, while others Insisted on imme
diate action.
With the gunboat Cartagena came
two Colombian generals, Amaya and
Tovor, and Colonel Torres, all ignorant
of the headway of the secession move
ment. The arrival of the Cartagena
forced the hands of the secessionists
and those who advocated action finally
prevailed.

"Roomers in the house at once applied
oil and other remedies to the burned
body of Mrs. Pisani and a call was sent
for a doctor and ambulance from the
Central Emergency Hospital..
When the ambulance arrived Mrs. Pi
sani was conscious and she positively
refused to be removed to the hospital.
Shortly afterward Mrs. Dr. E. E. Mc-
Kay was summoned and everything
possible was done to alleviate the in
jured woman's sufferings. Medical aid,
however, was without avail, and Mrs.
Pisani died at 4 p. m. Her body was
removed to the Morgue.
A rumor was circulated that the
woman's husband had been heard
quarreling with her shortly before the
accident and Detective O'Day investi
gated the case and found there was ab
solutely no foundation for the rumor.
Mrs. â¢ William O'Brien, a lodger in
the house, who helped to put out the
burning clothing of Mrs. 'Pisani and to
minister Â»to the injured woman, in
formed Detective O'Day that. Mrs. Pi
sani had told her how the accident had
happened.
Pisani stated yesterday that his wife
was in the habit of. using oif*to start
fires and that he had repeatedly
warned her as to the danger of the
practice.
Mrs. John Pisani, 39 years of age,
wife of a teamster, who resided with
her husband in a lodging-house at HIS
Howard street, was fatally burned yes
terday as the result of lighting a fire
in a cooking stove with Illuminating
oil.
The unfortunate woman was about
to prepare the noonday meal, and in
order to make the wood fire burn read
ily, poured oil from a can on the al
ready lighted wood.
The oil blazed up and enveloped Mrs.
Pisani in flames. She was dressed in a
calico wrapper and apron and rushed
from her room to a porch, her cloth
ins being a mass of flames. Her hus
band, who was about to enter the room
when the accident took place, was
thrust aside by the frenzied wife.
Mrs. Pisani dashed screaming along
the porch and some of the roomers en
veloped her quickly, in a rug while her
husband threw a bucket of water over
her and extinguished her burning cloth
ing.

"WASHINGTON, Dee. 6.â Monsignor
O'Connell, rector of the Catholic Uni
versity, narrowly escaped death this
evening. An electric car struck a cab
in which he was seated, demolishing
the vehicle, hurling the horse back
ward, to the bottom of an open sewer
thirty feet deep and leaving the priest
unharmed on the brink of au excava
tion.
The accident occurred a few hundred
yards from the entrance gate of the
university. Mgr. O'Connell, after satis
fying himself that his driver was safe,
looked over the edge of the deep sewer.
"It's an act of merciful providence.
There is a God in Israel," he said, tear
fully and reverently. "I do not under
stand how I escaped with my life, or
why the disaster -was not an appalling
one. It will always be a mystery to
me, and nothing but the mercy of Al
mighty God saved me, protected my
driver and preserved the lire of a faith
ful horse."
Cabman Dan Callahan, who it was
thought was killed, escaped with a
sprained arm. Â¦ ,
When the brakemen got to McKee he
had been frightened into a reasonable
state of sobriety. He was plucked
from his perilous perch and sent to the
Receiving Hospital. Steward Borchert
examined his patient ana pronounced
him to be unharmed. After that the
police took charge of McKee.
In the midst of his efforts to dear
the rails McKee ran afoul of a freight
train's locomotive that was pulling and
puffing its way through the city. The
belated and beerladen wayfarer could
not dodg-e anything bigger than a peb
ble, and barely that. So the engine
struck McKee. Instead of grinding
him into mangled bits, this condescend
ing locomotive picked up the helpless
obstruction and laid him across the
cowcatcher, where McKee was held
during a run of several hundred feet.
A train hand discovered the pilot's pas
senger.
PickM up by the pilot and carried
two blocks, -while teetering on the edge
of the Insecure resting place, then es
caping without a scratch, was the ex
perience of Frank McKee, a laborer,
this morning in an encounter with a
Southern Pacific freight train at First
street and Broadway.
McKee had been enjoying himself
during the early part of the evening.
His dalliance over the beer that steams
and likewise cheers had put Frank a
bit to the wrong side- He had essayed
to find his way to lodgings at the lower
end of town, but during his peregrina
tions etumbled across the railroad
tracks along First street.

His Grace Archbishop Montgomery
administered confirmation to a large
number of boys and girls yesterday
afternoon at St. Patrick's Church; on
Mission street, between Third and

It was the existence of these condi
tions that called forth. In 1874. the
enactment of a law by the Legislature
called the "compulsory education
law," wherein "every child between
FIBST LAW A FAILUBE.
The greatest problem that confronts
the people to-day is not the Panama
affair, nor the tariff matter, nor any
of the politico-commercial questions
that conjure up special sessions of
Congress and call forth platfrom
platitudes and editorial eloquence, but
it is a matter that concerns the chil
dren of the toilers, those millions of
children that a few years hence will
be called upon to assum^the duties
of citizenship, and to whom will fall
the solution of such of our social and
economic problems as are solvable
with the means at hand. And that
these children may be properly
equipped to meet these conditions, it
is necessary that they secure such ed
ucation as â¢will render them at least
intelligent being*, capable of under
standing the rights and duties that
come with the accession to manhood
tnd womanhood. And since educa
tion makes for the development of
character, and character Is the key
stone of good citizenship, then the
only safeguard of our nation lies in
the proper education of our children.
Now, "Wherefore these platitudes?"
says the cheerful unobserver. "Didn't
we solve that problem long ago when
we established our public school sys
tem, under which every child who
wants it can obtain a free educa
tion?" Ah: therein lies the problem
â in the clause. "Who wants it?"
And the problem is enlarged by an
other clause, "Whose parents or
guardians permit him to take it."
Clearly, under the law. every child
has the right to acquire an education,
but what of the children who refuse
to accept the state's munificent of
fer and who prefer the liberties and
licenses of the street instead? And
what of those parents and gfcardians
who will not, or cannot, see to it
that their boys and girls accept the
education thus iirovided for them?
And what of that class of parents
who turn their progeny out to work
during the years that should be spent
In the schoolroom?
B7 Laura Bride Powers.
The new law calls for the appoint
ment of one attendance officer (truant
officer) for every 20.000 children, whose
duty it shall be to respond to calls
from the principals in his district, and
to visit the homes of such absentees as
the ages of S and 14 years shall
go to school for at least two-thirds of
the school year, twelve weeks of which
shall be consecutive," etc., and then
came the enumeration of the "excep
tions" that punctured the law so full
of holes as to render it Valueless. So
far as kno\yn no prosecution of parents
or guardians was ever obtained under
the law, although violations of the
spirit of the enactment were manifest
wherever boys and schools were con
tiguous. - ' ; " .
That flagrant violations of the law
existed in San Francisco was well
known to many men and women inter
ested in ttte rights of children, the re
sult of which was a combined effort to
ward the enactment of a new law upon
compulsory* education, and at the last
session of the Legislature such a meas
ure was adopted. Women from the Cal
ifornia Club and from the Settlement
districts went before the legislators and
explained the duty that the State owed
to itself, and urged that a . law be
framed without the flaws of its prede
cessor, and this is what they gave us,
briefly: Every parent or guardian hav
ing control of a child between the ages
of S and 14 shall send such child to
school at least during five months of
the year, eighteen weeks of which
must be consecutive, unless it be proved
to the Board of Education that the
child is ill. or the parents extremely
ill or poor, or that the parents need the
support of said child; failure to comply
with said regulations is punishable by
arrest on the charge of misdemeanor,
and on conviction a fine from 510 to J50
or imprisonment from five to twenty
five days, or both, may be imposed. So
says the law! And its "say" has really
proved of some benefit, although its
prosecution has not been as vigilant as
-its projectors had hoped. Too many
loopholes? Well, perhaps. '
Now, the women's clubs have under
taken the task of helping the educa
tional authorities In the work, notably
the California Club, the Settlement
clubs and the Associated Charities, and
these are now busily engaged In com
piling reports upon this all-Important
question, which Superintendent Lang
don and Mr. '^Woodward of the Board of
Education are anxiously awaiting.
As to the appointment of the new
"attendance officers," there seems to be
no immediate necessity for change in
the method now in progress, save, per
haps, the appointment of one or two
more to assist in the work. Mr. Wood
ward declares there are no funds
wherewith to pay "attendance officers"
at present, two police officers in citi
zens' clothes detailed by Chief Witt
man attending to the duties and seem
to perform those services very satisfac
torily. It is true they are not specially
"trained" to the work, but both are
men of kindly nature and seemingly
understand the duties. It was my priv
ilege to accompany Mr. Floyd upon his
rounds of "rounding up" derelicts in
the Latin quarter and noted the tact
and intelligence with which he handled
the little' tykes of the cul-de-sacs "that
thread Telegraph Hill. Here, by the
way, is the heaviest Vork to be done,
for here Is the law violated with the
connivance of full knowledge of the
parents.' Little chaps whose". business
Is wtyh books. are out selling limes or
matches, ducks, etc., with fathers
or often on their own account,- and, It
is a fact that many of -these*, fathers
own the houses in which ! they dwell
and make a good return of their day's
perambulations,, but "are afflicted with
the "get-rich-quick" fever and crave
the nickels the little chaps bring home.
But here in this: new Italy, where ba
bies grow like mushrooms and there's
ever room for one more, . e'en though
the roof tree consists of but two or three
cubbyholes, there Is the reign of simple
happiness and -radiant â¢ content. .No
jarring note of quarrel or â complaint
was "heard in our rounds, but a / soft
and smiling declination to comply .with
the officer's request that Mary be-sent
to school. "But -she's.- ray â¢ girl. ; She
must help\me wash, Slgnor," saysan
interpreter, voicing the protest of * a
smiling young mother with a lusty^ in
fant under one arm â¢ and a tiny tyke
at her skirt. Needed her'to help with
the. washing! Ah, me!
Little Mary had " begun her drudgery,
early in her tiny career, and yet there
was the overburdened mother. Well.the
officer, convinced the mother, who had
never heard "of the Rooseyeltlah j cru
sade that, -washing or no washing, Mary,
would ; have to- go : to school,"- and go
then: - So Mary, black eyed and pretty;
BEGIN DRUDGING EABLY.
As for San Francisco, there is no ap
parent ' reason, why. Superintendent
Langdon's recommendation to the
Board of Education, dated July 18.
should not be acted upon at the begin
ning of next term. And it is to this
end that th3 clubwomen are bestirring
themselves to assist in the work, which
assistance the School Board has gra
ciously consented to accept.
j During a recent address to the Cali
Â¦ fornla Club Miss Stebbins, the proba
! tlon officer of the Juvenile Court,, made
' the Interesting statement that in the
325 cases of boys and the twenty-five
girls that have come under her super
vision since May, the largest number
have come from homes of drunkard
parent?, one or both; the /econd larg
est, where the parents had been sep
i arated, and the breadwinning and the
homemaking devolved upon one parent,
and the third class, where a step-par
ent, usually a stepmother, had been
Introduced into the household. Here is
a negative tribute to the economic val
ue of a home â a home In Its true sense,
with its order, comfort and protecting
love â as the most potent factor in the
development of character. But what is
to be done for the children who showed
a lack of discrimination in their selec
tion "of parents? Are we justified to see
them wander at will into the byways
of idleness, ignorance and crime sim
ply because their natural' protectors
have failed to fulfill their obligations?
Clearly we as a progressive and intelli
gent people must put forth our best ef
forts for these unhappy children. firBt,
for the humanitarian reason of saving
these fellow beings from ruin, and sec
ond, for the selfish reason of saving
ourselves from them. Now, the new
law makes provision for these wards of
the people by enabling us to establish
"parental schools," such as are in suc
cessful operation in many Eastern
cities. These schools are of two types,
one the "Parental Day Schools." where
occasional truants>a.nd "mild" incorrig-
Ibles whose home Influences are healthy
may attend.^ The hours are longer than
those of the regular school, and the
hands are given much to do. Manual
training and military drill are inter
spersed with elementary school work,
and numerous cases are recorded where
exemplary boys have emerged from the
active course given in this ungraded
school. But, to be' sure, success de
pends largely upon the personal effi
ciency of the teacher. Then, for the
class whose homes are parodies on the
name, and where discord and vicious
conditions exist, there is the "Parental
Boarding School," where the children
are housed and maintained. In addition
to the training given in the "Parental
Day School." Juvenile criminals are
not received in either of these schools,
but are sent to the "Reform Schools,"
such as this State maintains at Whit
tier and lone. Boston, Chicago, New
York, Albany, Brooklyn and many oth
er. Eastern cities maintain both types
of parental schools, while a few have
as yet adopted the first class only.
directed, learning the cause of such ab
sence, or if truancy (which, by the way,
is not classed as a crime) has been per
petrated. Now, many a "lad neither
vicious nor incorrigible has "played
hookey," and so has his father before
him. But It is not that lad that the
law 1b made to reach. It's the fellow
that has defied authority at school,
either because his interest in school has
not been roused or because he -is idle
and rebellious and prefers to "loaf"
around the streets, parks or wharves
with his gang. Of this class there are
two species â one whose parents co-op
erate, to the best of their ability, with
the attendance officer and the teacher,
and the second species, whese parents
are. totally indifferent in the matter.
This is the class from which the thugs
and highwaymen are recruited. And it
is therefore this class with which we
are most concerned, and with which
the "compulsory education law" must
be made to reach. :t'A'l

THE annual report. of r Secretary of Agriculture Wil
son reviewing the production and exports of agri
cultural products shows that the favorable credit in
the balance of trade for the last" decade is due entirely to
the farmers. According to Secretary Wilson's report
balance of trade in favor of farm products during the
last fourteen years aggregated; $4,806,000,000. In;prod
ucts other than agricultural for .the same "term of /years
the balance of trade was adverse to this country to the
extent of. $865,090,000/ The increase of exports of farm
products for the last fifty years ending in 1901 he: shows
to have been from $147,000,006 to* $952,000,000. *
No more auspicious augury of the continued welfare of
the" country's trade interests could be found. The fact
that the favorable balance of trade of the nation depends
not upon the manufacture of, imported material -or : the
fabrication of home stuffs, but upon the actual producÂ«

A well known art critic in the East
has written the following trite review
of the work of a famous painter of the
impressionistic school:
"Camille Pissarro, the French painter,
who died recently in Paris at the age of
73. was a native of the French Antilles,
but went to France at an early age. He
was a favorite pupil of Corot, but about
thirty years ago he became one of the
leaders of the Impressionistic school.
Pissarro's early work was idealistic.
as was natural to one who learned of
Corot, but his later development would
have much amazed that soul of sim
plicity and poetic vision. With Monet
and Slsley he led the vagary of rest
lessness and discomfort, with nature
in theatrical poses, trees as tremu
lous as reeds, water on the verge of.
catching fire, buildings as " fragile as
dreams, and the earth a hysterical
phantasmagoria. Pissarro was neither
so able as Monet nor so Incoherent as
Slsley, but he made one note In -the
cacophony of so-called impressionism,"

I insist on a postponement until he can

The following Is told on the late
Judge Campbell when he was Police
Judge of this city. A prisoner was be
fore him for some petty crime, but had
no attorney. The prosecution, not
wishing to take undue advantage of the
prisoner, moved a postponement till he
could get a lawyer. Judge Campbell
said, "Oh, that's all right. This is a
small case. Let it go and I'll see that
the man's Â¦ interests are protected."
During the trial the court undertook
to examine the defendant as follows:

Speed la likely to be the great dis
covery of the twentieth century. In
deed, motion especially adapted to
transportation seems to be our great
est aim. We still remember the thrill
with which we heard of the sixty
mile an hour train. It was nothing
short of wonderful. The'n came
seventy miles and ninety miles. Early
this year a , mono-railroad between
Manchester and Liverpool. England,
put the record up to 110 miles an
hour. We had hardly become accus
tomed to this, hardly passed the
stage of regarding it as a freak,
when from Germany came the news
that on the Marienfeld-Zossen Mili
tary Road an efectric car made a speed
of over 125 miles an hour. The news
came with the statement that even
higher records were expected, an ex
pectation that was realized a few
days later In the highest record yet
obtained â 130 2-5 miles an hour.
Though this record stands at the
present time of writing, it is not at
all unlikely that before this appears
in print a new one may be estab
lished. The engineers of the above
road have declared 150 miles per
hcjur as their goal. In light of pre
vtious results tts consummation is
not incredible. â Current Literature.

In reviewing Consul General Mason's report Senator
Frye says: "Mr. Mason states that twenty years ago, on
the initiative of Prince Birmarck, then Chancellor of the
German empire, the imperial Government bound itself
to pay a subsidy of 4,400,000 marks ($1,047,500) a year
for fifteen years to the North German Lloyd Steamship
Company for a line to Australia and the Orient, com
posed of vessels 'to be built in German yards of German
material and manned throughout by German subjects.'
Our Consul General goes on to show how this truly
'extraordinary' subsidy, and the accompanying require
ment that the subsidized ships should be built in German
yards, so~ stimulated construction in the empire that
?both the North German Lloyd and the Hamburg-Ameri
can companies were enabled to order home ships like the
Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, Friedrich der Grosse, Koni
gin Luise,. Augusta Victoria, Furst Bismarck, Patricia
and Palatia: 'That they did this at all,' Consul General
Mason declares, 'was mainly due to the fact that they
were forced into it by an act of legislation.' And this
opinion that the celebrated German liners are thus the
direct fruit of state aid to German shipyards is con
firmed by. the_ specific statement of the report on steam
ship subsidies submitted to the Reichstag in" 1898 that 'all
experts assert that without the influence of the Govern
ment ocean mail service such a steamer as the Kaiser
Wilhelm der Grosse could not have been built.' And
this is equally true of Herr Ballin's great Deutschland."
The direct subsidies do not by any means constitute all
the aid given by the German .Government to German
shipping \lines. , Among other means of. promoting the
shipping industry of. the empire the Government has
given orders that all material used for shipbuilding in
German yards shall be carried by the state railroads at
bare cost of transportation. That of course means a
considerable bounty and is equivalent itself to a liberal
subsidy. ,
Havipg profited by such subsidies and other, govern
mental aids, the German shipping companies are now in
a position to compete with the British as carriers of the
world's commerce. They have carried the competition
so far that the British in their turn have had to ' grant
heavy. subsidies, such as that recently given to the Cunard
line. It is under such circumstances Herr/Ballin advises
us not to protect our ocean industries as we protect those
on land. " Doubtless the American people, will, perceive
the significance of the advice and know how to draw the
right conclusion from it. />.. " "
H ERR 'ALBERT BALLIN. director general of the
Hamburg- American Company, one of the largest
of German steamship corporations, recently
through the New York Herald made an earnest plea to
the American people to abstain from granting subsidies
to American shipping. The plea comes strangely from
an official of a company that has long received a very
large subsidy from his own Government^and whose pros
perity was virtually built up by governmental aid, but it
is not altogether unnatural. The fact is that Herr Bal
lin's company gets a large share of the American carry
ing trade, and would lose it were we to have a merchant
marine of our own. When those facts are taken into
consideration it will be seen that the plea of Herr Ballin
is nothing more than a suggestion to the American peo
ple that they leave their trade to foreign ship owners
and be content to pay the tribute, whjch of late years has
averaged about $200,000,000 a year.
Senator Frye, whose attention was called to the state
ment of the advice-giving director general, has re
sponded to it, citing the reports of Frank H. Mason,
our Consul General at Berlin, upon the means resorted
to by the Berlin Government to build up the German
merchant marine. These reports show clearly that the
great success the Germans have achieved of late in for
eign commerce is due almost wholly to the measures
adopted by Bismarck to provide liberal subsidies for
ships engaged in foreign trade. The example thus
worked out in practice is much more .worthy of American
attention than the advice of Herr Ballin that we do the
other thing. Â»

Out of the place he stormed. In five
minutes McKenzie was in communica

utes later Division Superintendent
Wilder had received orders. By the
following noon McKenzie had a res
taurant outfit in full commission oper
ating down in the railroad yards, and
500 men a day were eating there at fig
ures so far below the. rates charged

signs" disappeared like magic.
William McKenzle, superintendent of
the ferry and river boat service of the
Southern Pacific Company, tells a good
story of the way he outwitted some of
the West Oakland strike sympathizers
during the great American Railway
Union strike in '94. J ;.;':
At that time McKenzie was master
mechanic 'of the western division of
the Southern Pacific Company, withal
one of the railroad's most popular offi
cials. But the strike fever was at high
pitch and Oakland as the terminus of
the largest division on the system felt
the brunt of it. One day when the
battle was at Its height < McKenzle
sauntered into a big restaurant at the
"Point," where many of the striking
railroad men had boarded. Stepping
to a place at the long counter, McKen
zie called for his meal.
"You can't eat here." blandly an
nounced the proprietor, pointing to a
large sign that hung in the window.
"No scabs fed here," was the legend
that greeted the astonished McKenzie's
eyes.

According to advices from the Treas

at Philadelphia will cease to grind out
pennies for a time, there being now a
surplusage of this kind of currency In
the country. During the past five years
3,000,000,393 pennies have been shipped
from the Philadelphia Mint, which is
the onfy one that coins the one-cent
pieces, to various parts of the country.
Between July 1, 1902. and June 1, 1903,
89,600,000 cents were coined. If this
five-year output were collected In a
heap It would make a sizable stage
mountain at Iea3t. Placed side by side
In a straight line 3,000,000,000 pennies
would make a ribbon over 23,000 miles
long, and would come pretty near gird
ling the earth. Piled on top of one
another they would reach up toward
the stars for a distance that would
take a good many Eiffel towers to
equal, fdr it would be not less than
2400 miles â far out beyond the point
where the force of gravitation is sup
posed to be very active. Since, on the
ordinary basis of computation, there
are supposed to be about 29O,06o,0OO chil
dren in the world under ten years of
age. Uncle Sam would be able from
his present stock of pennies to give
each child on the earth ten copper
keepsakes and have enough left over
to fill a good-sized savings bank be

These two influences within
womankind fight for man, and either
or both is often stronger than her
pleasure in. her work, her love of
independence and all the reasons
combined which keep her single.
Then weiffh the balance yet more
with a man whom she admires, hon
ors and loves, and there is but one
reason why woman does not marry â
she cannot. Therefore, if man wishes
the data concerning- matrimony and
educated women to change he has
simply to make himself the man
whom a woman of mind, heart and*
character will deaire, and surely it
is better to be chosen as a fine type
of higher manhood than as the payer
of bills. . The man, not his money,
In the compliment such a woman
pays him when she ceases to be the
â¢woman who does not wish, to marry.
Let there be more men of that stamy
â¢ â¢
There are elways in Â¦womanly women
two motives for marriage strong with
in them, and it is often an actual pain
to act counter to them. First of all is
the desire for children. After a woman
has reached SO years, unless ehe is a
shallow creature, she regrets that she
does not know motherhood. Something
nays to her plainer than any person
can that in missing this highest glory
Â¦of womanhood ehe has lost more than
she can gain. There is an aching in her
heart which nothing Btills and for
which petting of animals and other
people's children is a poor substitute.
Then another inducement to the
self-supporting woman toward mat
rimony is the desire to belong to
somebody. It is not that she wants
a home . of her own â she has it as
the fruit of her labors and the in
dependence for which she pays the
price; it is not even for the sake of
man's society, for that, too, she has
If she is a woman of intelligence and
womanliness; she finds men enough
for companions; it is not that she
wants to be supported â quite the con
trary â probably she has earned her
own money so long and spent it so
freely that she would be somewhat
awkward about using any other per
son's. The influence that draws her
is simply the desire or the need to
have an owner of herself, some one
to whom she is of the greatest im
portance. Perhaps the instinct, is
merely a survival from the primitive
days when the woman without her
master and his club was an abnormal
product.
It is true that woman loves her free
dnm, perhaps the more that it is so
new to her. She realizes as no man
can the b!ef?sinps which have been hi3
for nges to work as he will and climb
where darinsr leads, and she longs to
work, too, and to climb, to make her
self something to the big world, and
even more to that little circle which is
her world. She loves the possibility of
this power so well that she will not
resign it for an unworthy claimant.
Women have so long been forgiving
to man's infidelities that it may be sur
prising to be told that they have kept
women from marrying, yet the state
ment is true. There 'are women who
have what is called instinctive virtue
and who have no comprehension and
can have none of the average man's
point of view. To such a one it Is mon-
Etrous that a man can be untrue to her
before marriage as after. She knows
no reason why he more than she should
seek illicit pleasures, and when she
learns that he has such a wave of dis
gust sweeps over her that it carries
him as far away from her as if he had
never lived. Such women are not so
rare as once they were, and in this is
the explanation of many a marriage
put off on the wedding eve itself. A
woman sometimes forgives because she
loves much, but she no more continues
to love in the same way than does the
man who forgives the woman who has
wronged him. As her sense of justice
and of personality develop In the com
ing years she will forgive less readily.
The law in many States so discrim
inates against woman that, it is an ar
gument agrainst marrying to those who
know anything about it. The man,
generous fellow, says at his wedding',
"With all my worldly poods I thee
endow," and the wife who believes it
finds to her surprise that so far from
being the recipient of all his worldly
poods he own? even the parments Khe
wears. The woman who sees her as
sistant's salary drawn by the worth
less husband with whom she will not
live, but who can live on her earn
ings, is not likely to think well of a
condition which permits the Injustice;
the who reads of a child willed away
from its mother for no better reason
than the malice of an angry husband
is likely to deliberate a little, for if na
ture teaches anything or proves any
thing, it is that the child is the moth
er's. When the law gives children to
their mothers it will do much to make
women wish to marry and to become
mothers. It may seen doubtful if these
points in the law would keep any
woman from marrying, but they have.
Many women will not marry because
they prefer to keep their individuality,
ae they cannot if they wed. They do
r.ot care, to change their entire scheme
of living to suit some man. They are
selfish? Perhaps, but at least they
make no one else the victim of their
fault.

"Of course the only kind of a mouth
piece to use with a meerchaum pipe Is
amber. The principal source of supply
of meerchaum is in the country border
ing the Black Sea; the principal source
of amber is on the shores of the Baltic
Sea, where the fossilized gum is dug
out, sometimes one hundred feet below
the surface. After heavy storms on the
Baltic, pieces of amber are cast ashore
by the waves, showing that the amber
vein extends under the water. The am
ber blocks are sawed into pieces suit
able for pipe stems by an extremely
thin saw. The blocks are sawed on a
taper and are four-sided. The beauti
ful translucent material' is worked up
into pipe stems by a 'bernsteindrech
sier," or amber worker, and the best of
them are in Germany.
"The amber pipe stems and mouth
pieces are made In a foot power lathe
and much skill is required to shape,
twist and drill the brittle material.
Amber will crack if a hole is bored
straight through In one direction. So
the amber turner bores a hole in from
one end and then finishes the. operation
by boring In from the other end. As
the boring is done without measuring
tools, .the workman must be an expert
to bring the two bores exactly together.
"Some amber mouthpieces are curved,'
and this is done after the amber, is
shaped and bored. The straight mouth
piece is put in hot oil until it loses its
stiffness and it then is bent to the re
quired curve. The long twisted amber
mouthpieces are not twisted In the
sense that the amber Is' twisted; the
spirals are filed to- shape by hand and
then polished. They look as I though
they had been twisted /rom end to end.
"The nam-tash, as the rough, un
treated blocks are called, Is white, with
a yellow tint, and so soft that it can be
easily scratched with the finger nail.
The red clay is removed and the meer
schaum dried before it is shipped to
Constantinople. In summer the blocks
are exposed to the sun for five or six
days, but In winter they are dtled for
eight "or ten days In a stove-heated
room. When dried the blocks are
rubbed with wax and each is carefully
wrapped in cotton and packed for ship
ment. Most of it finds its way to Vi
enna, but lately Americans have gone
to the mines to buy direct from the
miners, for the meerschaum is growing
in popularity in this country. The fin
est of the kidney-shaped chunks event
ually find their way to this country;
not in the rough, however, but in the
form of fine pipes. Almost 200 tons of
meerschaum Is mined in the Eski She
hier each year.
"The best merchaum pipes are made
In Vienna, and there ttfe pipe bowls,
after being turned or carved, are pol
ished and then boiled In wax or some
preparation of paraffin. The bowls
are again polished and then are ready
to be colored by the smoker. ,
â¢ â¢ â¢
"I was told that meerschaum had
been dug from the ground around Eski
Shehier for more than 1000 years and
that there was an inexhaustible sup
ply of the magnesium. In one district
over S000 mines or pits have been
opened and In another district the num
ber of holes in the ground from which
meerschaum has been taken run over
20,000. The meerschaum is found In
a layer of red clay all the way from
twenty-five to 180 feet beneath the sur
face. The Turks do not use any up-to
date machinery to dig the chunks of
meerschaum. They pick out a likely
spot and then a dozen or so begin dig
ging with pickaxes and shovels. They
keep diggingâ not a shaft, but a pitâ
until they reach the red clay. Then
they tunnel in, sometimes as far as a
quarter of a mile. They work night and
day extracting the blocks of meer
schaum. These blocks are scattered
through the red clay, the lumps rang
ing in size frojn pieces as big as a small
egg to chunks a foot cube. The lumps
are kidney shaped and when found are
covered with a thick envelope of the red
clay. They are carried out to^the pit,
lifted to the ground and stacked up
in the huts of the miners. They are
taken to E6ki Shehier every Friday,
where they are sold to agents who con
gregate in the town every week.
â¢ â¢ â¢
"That's right," cheerfully responded
the tobacconist, "they're all meer
schaum. You never knew before, did
you, that the bowl which you have
been trying to color for a year is only a
chunk of hydrated silicate of mag
nesium, a bit of sepiolite, a piece of
ecume de mer, a fragment of. seafoam?
You thought it was only meerschaum.
And you didn't knotv that your favor
ite meerschaum pipe came from the
bowels of the earth, dug 150 feet under
ground by a red-fezzed Turk in Asia
Minor. And you never would guess
that in Morocco the boys , with the
baggy trousers use meerschaum for
soap and that in Madrid they build
houses of the same stuff. I didn't,
either, until last summer when I was
in Constantinople and was told they
dug 'ham-tash' out of mines not far
away, and that If I went to a town
called Eski Shehier over in Asia Minor
any Friday I could buy the raw
meerschaum direct from the mines. I
had been selling meerschaum pipes for
years and had always believed that
the clay â as I thought It wasâ came
from Vienna, Since my visit to Eski
Shehier my respect and regard for the
meerschaum pipe have greatly in
creased.
Within the store a long showcase was
filled with polished, > carved cream-col
ored pipes, all of them beautiful speci
mens of the pipe carver's art. Some
were labeled "hydrated silicate of mag
nesium," others "seafoam," "ecume de
mer" and "sepiolite."
"Why, they are all meerschaum," ex
claimed the man whose curiosity, ex
cited by the window placard, had led
him into the store.
Christmas shoppers, keen-eyed for*
novelties, paused before the holly
wreathed placard, the center of attrac
tion in the window display of the to
bacco dealer, which reacT: "Hydrated
silicate of magnesium pipes â the new
fad."

'About Pipes.
The Christmas business of the country is reported fully
up to the volume of last year.
Provisions have kept up their slow decline at Western
packing centers, but during the past few days the Chi
cago market has been showing increasing strength, with
speculative activity growing and packers and operators
more confident of the future. The San Francisco "mar
ket, however, has become dull during the past wcek^, and
hams and bacon have been marked down in consequence.
Taking the country as a whole, while commodity'prices
have been steadily settling, some lines, such as cotton
and dairy products, have risen so sharply that Dun's
index number has actually increased to ofe.223, against
97.825 a month-ago. The sensational rise in cotton is
probably the cause of most of this increase.
This advance in cotton was the feature of the week.
At New York, New Orleans, Liverpool and the large
English manufacturing towns the excitement was intense.
The Government report, showing a decrease in the cot
ton output, sent prices soaring skyward and caused con
sternation in Lancashire, where it was regarded as a
public calamity. is a two-edged sword,
however, and while damaging the' mill opera
tors and their operatives in England is enriching ; the
American planter,' who is making more money now than
in many years. In consequence the South is sending in
rosy reports of activity and confidence in trade, with'
plenty of money in circulation and collections easy. It
is an ill wind that blows nobody good.
The railway earnings of the country are steadily fall
ing off. As far as reported in November they were only
4.86 per cent larger than difring the same time in 1902,
and when the increased cost of material and the higher
wages are considered it is doubtful whether there was any
real increase. The bank clearings for the week showed
a loss of 1 x.i per cent from last year, with the gains and
losses about evenly distributed among the leading cities.
The failures for the week were 331, against 204 in the
corresponding week last year. This latter item makes a
poor showing for business in 1903 compared with pre
ceding years, especially as the failures of late have been
running large in liabilities.
The New York stock market continues quiet and
harmless. Liquidation has apparently run its course and
there are signs that a portion of the public is gradually
returning to the speculative arena. Most of the im
provement is shown by the railroads, as the industrials
have been more or less weak and in disfavor. This is
attributed to the unpleasant developments in the steel
and shipbuilding_trusts, which gave the public an un
pleasant shock and did much to shatter confidence. There
is now a general inclination to thoroughly explore the
status of corporations before investing in them, and
until most of the great combinations have been thus in
vestigated not much new money will go into them. The
public has a good deal of money left, jn Spite of the heavy
shrinkage in values during the past year, and is ready
to invest it if it can be assured of a reasonable amount of
safety.
The money market has thus far been an agreeable
surprise, all around. Instead of the marked stringency
anticipated earlier in the season we are having a com
paratively easy market for this time of the year, with
gold flowing into the country from Europe and Austra
lia, not to mention Japan. This influx of gold has been
an excellent cure for the blues into which' the country
had been steadily .drifting and reports from New York
say that not only is the spirit of despondency and pes
simism disappearing, but the country is actually getting
optimistic again. This is an excellent illustration of , the
homely old admonition not to cross a bridge before you
get to it.
To summarize, the business of the country, while un
dergoing a great change from the recent boom to mod
erate and normal conditions, is in excellent condition at
bottom and is like a great ship promptly obeying its helm
in gusty weather. We are still all right and nobody has
any cause to be alarmed over the outlook. ;
Some 200,000 industrial employes have suffered a cut
in wages of 10 per cent or more and preparations are
being made to secure a similar reduction affecting 300,000
more by the 1st of January. In some other parts of the
country wages have been advanced, but the reductions
are more "numerous than the advances. It is trying to
the wage-earner' to have his wages reduced, especially
at this time of the year, but thus far no trouble has re
sulted from the cuts, as the wage-earners are said to
realize that with the gradual decline in prices for many
and in fact most commodities the returns of capital are
smaller and growing still smaller. The textile mills of
Philadelphia are running on half time, window glass fac
tories, are reporting competition by foreign importations
and the footwear factories of New England are turning
out less than for some time back. Winter weather, while
improving the jobbing and retail trade in holiday novel
ties and winter clothing, is cutting down building opera
tions and restricting the demand for lumber and struc
tural material. Against this, however, there are .increas
ing small orders for iron and steel products. Woolen
goods sales are falling 6hort of expectations and the silk
factories report business thus far this year below earlier
estimates. *
THE readjustment of trade conditions* to a more
normal basis than has prevailed for several years is
going on apace. Both capital and labor are receding
from high planes and adjusting themselves to new terms.
Mills are closing down and others which have been
closed are reopening. Thus a number of paper mills in
the State of New York which closed down a fortnight or
so ago have just resumed operations. In the iron and
steel trade conditions are- irregular and unsettled,
but reports to Bradstrect's say that the shutdowns more
than offset the resumptions.
"Did what?" said the Judge, stepping
behind his desk and touchlrfg a button
that summoned his ballff from the
courtroom.
"Ach," almost yelled the excited Ger
man, coming closer to the Judge and
shaking his dilapidated finger and head,
"I am broke all over. It Iss your
fauld. My vlfe to-day vas mat because
she did not vas get a divorce by your
court. She came by the house back,
and she say to me: 'I bet I get dot
separations to-morrow. I make der
grounds.' " ".Â¦ j
The title of official peacemaker given
to Judge Graham because of his habit
of refusing: to divorce couples with a
large family, unless it Is shown that it
is absolutely Impossible for them to get
along In peace, usually rests lightly
upon the Judge. fThere are times,
however, when he does not think so
much of it. â¢
A few days ago he was Just about to
leave Ms chambers, when a big, wild
eyed German rushed In; Hl3 head was
swathed with yard after yanl of band
age stuff, and Ms face was almost cov
ered with plasters of every size. Point
ing a shaking and badly scratched
finger at the Judge, he shouted: "You

strates that the potential strength of our trade is where
it should beâ in the , soil. With our financial prosperity
builded upon this rock we have naught to fear from the
combinations of trade which may be made against us
by any of our commercial rivals across the seas.
The complaint has been long and persistent that our
agrarian interests were being' swamped in these days
of steel kings and oil trusts. Figures .have been ad
vanced to show that whereas forty years ago the agricul
turists possessed 55 per cent of the wealth of this coun
try, they may now lay claim only to 21 per cent. But
does this prove anything? The foremost interests of
any new country are the simplest agriculture. Then
when men commence to devote the money they have
earned from the ground to the building of ships, the
laying of railroads, the digging of mines, does it not fol
low that though the percentage of agricultural wealth
over all other wealth will decline the actual amount of
such wealth must increase with the increasing market
due to the development of every branch of industry? It
is not the question then of what proportion of the wealth
of the country is held by the farmers, but whether or not
their wealth is increasing at an appropriate ratio in re
spect to that of the shipbuilder or the mine owner.
No interest in the country has a brighter outlook than
that of agriculture. It is only within the last twenty
years that farming has been conducted upon anything
like a scientific basis. Formerly the squatter on the
plains worked his land with no conception<pf the proper
rotation of crops or of the replenishment"" of the hidden
springs of production; now by the aid of agricultural col
leges in nearly every State in t% Union, by the co-opera
tion of the efficient Department of Agriculture at Wash
ington and the application of modern farm machinery,
the farmer is enabled to double his gains from the soil.
What with the new methods of farming and the miles
upon miles of land in our great West which needs only
the magic touch of water to burst into magnificent frui
tion Secretary Wilson's report bids . fair to remain the
keynote of American prosperity for years to come.

It was stated by one of the officials
of the Southern Pacific yesterday that
Harriman's stay In this city, which
was originally intended to be prolonged
over a week, had to be cut short owing
to pressing business in the East, and
that the president of the road has in
view another visit to the coast early
during the coming year.
Late Saturday Harriman held a long
conference with A. B. Hammond, the
lumber magnate, who made a hurried
trip down, from Portland to meet the
railroad president and. talk over their
joint Interests in the northern part of
California, and later Harriman and
President Markham of the Houston
and Texas road, who came north to
meet the former, were closeted togeth
er for some time.
President E. H. Harriman and Gen
eral Manager Julius Kruttschnitt of

PRESIDENT HARBIMAN
I*EAVES FOR THE EAST
The captain of detectives was in
formed of another burglary that oc
curred at 107*4 Fifth avenue. The tool
Bhop and residence of A. Watkins was
entered during the early morning
hours, but nothing of great value
was taken. Watkins lost a num
ber of tools, but property In the
living rooms was not disturbed. En
trance in this case was effected by
applying a "Jlmmle" to a side window.
The police in the Golden Gate Park
section have been notified to keep a
sharp lookout for burglars and to ar
rest all suspicious characters found in
the district.
Burglars departed from the usual
method of securing loot in a crime com
mitted early yesterday morning. They
broke into Marchi's fruit market at 1520
Page street and not content with tak
ing the contents of the telephone box as
it remained on the wall, took the entire
instrument and made their escape.
When the burglary was discovered
yesterday morning It was found that
the thieves had forced an entrance with
a "Jiinmie." Once in the place they
commenced operations on the cash
register. From this box they secured
nothing and turned their attention to
the telephone. Again aplying their
"jimmie" they cut the wires and broke
the instrument from the wall. This
they carried to a vacant lot nearby,
where they proceeded to smash the iron
box and Docket the smalls amount of
money that It contained. The matter
was reported to the police and yester
day afternoon patrolmen found the tel
ephone where it had been abandoned.
An unidentified man, evidently about
75 years of age, was struck and in
stantly killed last evening about 6:30
o'clock by an inbound car of the San
Mateo line of the United Railroads,
about midway between the Black Hawk
dairy and Burlingame, in San Mateo
County. The body was brought to this
city on the car and now reposes on a
slab at the Morgue.
H. R. Dietel, the motorman on the
car, says he saw the deceased about
100 feet away alongside* of the track
on his hands and knees as if he / had
fallen and was endeavoring to get to
his feet! Dietel immediately applied
the air brakes, but as the car was run
ning thirty miles an hour, the old man
was struck before it could be brought
to a stop. The man was struck on
the head by the front' step and died
Instantly from a fractured skull..
] , The body was placed on the front
platform and broughtjto this city with
all possible dispatch, as it was thought
that life was not entirely extinct.
When it was ascertained that death
had ensued the Coroner was notified
and Deputy Fenneli and Messenger
Frank Murphy met the car at Market
and Fifth streets and conveyed the
remains to the Morgue. There was
absolutely nothing in the pockets of
the deceased that would serve as a
means of identification. His injury
shows that death was instantaneous.
As the accident occurred in San
Mateo County, it is expected the Cor
oner of that county will make a de
mand upon Coroner Iceland for the re
mains.
When the nor United State* cruiser Taeoma
en h<r trial trip came to anchor In the harbor
of BtBtS Barbara the fair belles cf that city
tad anticipated a visit en board the vessel
and an iatj^cticn of Uncle Sam's tee acquisi
tion to his navy. They caine out in launches.
Sn beat? and tuts and â¢were prepared to gife
the ehlp and fcer officers a Tvarcn welcome to
their city, but Imagine their dismay when they
arrived alongside to see or-ly a rope ladder to
give them access to the shta's deck. They
locked In vain for the regulation ship stairway,
but it was rot there. The officers on board
th* Taroma looked chagrined and mortified
ar.d the girls looked unhappy. The Union Iron
Â¦VVcra* had foreoittn thus very Important ac
cessory.
The Ladies Disappointed.
The Relief had got under way
r^nd, aided by a strongrflood tide, was
hauling its tow along at a good rate
of speed. When off the ferry build
ing the rowboat was suddenly sucked
under the keel of the bark and the
two sailors disappeared with it.
Shouts of warning brought the tug
boat to a stop and the unfortunate
men were picked up far astern.
They were nearly exhausted when
hauled aboard the ship. The row
boat was dislodged from its position
under the ship with great difficulty.
The French bark Jules Gommes was
being towed by the tugboat Relief
from Union-street wharf to the Union
Iron Works when the accident oc
curred. A small Whitehall was tied to
the bow of the vessel. In it were
riding two of the sailors from the
bark who had been assisting in get
ting a line aboard the tug, and who
were to assist in making the large
Ehlp fast when it reached its destina
tion.
To be carried with a rowboat un
der the keel of a large ship, held
down beneath the surface of the
water for gome time and yet live to
tell the tile was the harrowing ex
perience of two French sailors yester
day afternoon.
The management announces that next
week's attraction, "The Bonnie Brier
Bush," win begin next Sunday night
and not at the matinee, as is the pres
ent custom.
The little actress .is a dainty parcel of
comedy and drama combined,. and the
Grand Opera-House is * certain to be
largely patronized during the week of
Miss Marie Heath and "For Mother's
Sake." v
' There was a mixture of laughter and
tears at the Grand Opera- House yes
terday afternoon and evening, and all
because Carrie-Ashley-Clarke's play,
"For Mother's Sake," was intensely,
emotional and happily humorous in
turns.
Miss Marie Heath, In a , well-drawn
character, won the hearts of the audi
ences on both occasions, and applause
came so strong at the end of each of
the four acts that the curtain had to
be raised again and again in response
to the demands.
"For Mother's Sake" is a wholesome,
bright, witty and amusing bit of play
wright's wcrk, dealing with scenes of
rural New England and a mining camp
in Colorado, and in both locations
there is found sentiment, heroism, filial
affection and self-denial.
Miss Heath,' while the very core of the
big nugget of fun that runs. through the
whole length of the play and reasona
bly arrests the sobs that come in sym
pathy to a heart-afflicted mother, is
not alone in the long list of good play
ers, but is surrounded with a company
of capable actors and , actresses who
keep the interest up to a keen edge.
Miss Heath, in the character of Joe
Pemberton, the son of a kindly mother
whose husband has been wrongfully
accused of a gross murder, determines
to right the wrong done his father, and
heroically succeeds in achieving his
purpose, to the delight of every, one.
.Francesca Redding Is the shining
star in "The Cattle Queen," a clever
sketch from the pen of Will M. Cressy.
Miss Redding has bright linos and she
creates great laughter by ner manner
of delivering them. The playlet 6cored
a big hit and will be enjoyed by patrons
of the popular playhouse.
Clarice Vance is the best singer of
ragtime melodies that has come to this
city in years. Her style is inimitable
and her negro dialect perfect. She is
strictly at home before the footlights
and renders popular melodies in a way
that brings down the house. "Bonner,"
the "writing horse." Is a handsome ani
mal and well trained. His â¢ master is
a trifle severe in his tafk to the audi
ence, otherwise the act is a good one.
Hines and Remington have returned
and are as popular as in the old days.
Mis3 Hlnes sclntilllates with bright ex
pressions, and her takeoffs oc "well
known vaudeville artists and people one
meets in every day life' are very good.
Agnes Mahr has danced herself into
favor and her work is always heartily
applauded. "A Very Bad Boy," pre
sented by Hal Godfrey and company,
can be seen a second time and enjoyed.
Godfrey Is a good actor and has clever
people supporting him. Joseph New
man has a number of new songs and
stories and "The Brittons" continue
their wonderful dancing. Â¦ r
Pauline Hall, looking slenderer than
ever and with her voice in perfect tune,
opened at the Orpheum yesterday, and
the receptions accorded her at each
performance attested to the great popu
larity of this eminent comic opera
prima donna. Despite Increasing years,
the fair Pauline retains her splendid
figure. She sang three songs and sang
them well. Her best song and the one
that brought theatergoers back to the
good old days of comic opera, was the
lullaby song fro'm "Ermlnie." She ren
dered the beautiful melody with great
expression and was recalled a number
of times.
The California offers a show worth
attending this .week. "Yon Yonson,"
old but always welcome, with Nelse B.
Erickson in the title role, drew a
packed house last night and gave en
tire satisfaction. A 6trong company
supported the presentation of the ,old
Swedish comedy drama, that excels
most of the plays in Its line. There was
a good quartet, and the specialties, in
troduced in the second and third acts,
were all entertaining. Thpugh suffering
from a severe cold Mr.* Erickson won
the house with dialect and comic songs,
and one in particular, a parody on
"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old
Town To-night," was accorded several
encores.
Erickson Is truly one of the best
Swedish characters on the stage, and
sustained his reputation at last night's
performance. He misses no opportu
nity to bring out all therw Is in the
part, and his interpretation of the un
sophisticated laborer is perfect. Madge
"Wood Is excellent in the role of Jennie
Morris, a vivacious heiress reduced to
the penury of a book agent, and Grace
Jennings, a victim of a plot and who
later becomes happy as the brother of
Yon, is acted by Lillian Rose, who has
an excellent personality on the stage.
John Holloway, the villain, Is done by
E. Guy Spangler, and Thomas O'Brien
impersonates Gerald Harcourt, the
English tourist.
Miss Maud Le Page takes the part of
Roly, Harcourt's nephew. She Is clever,
full of life and does a good song and
dance. Amos Jennings Is sustained by
James C. Mack, and Minnie Sharp ap
pears as Mrs. Laflln, a hotel proprie
tress. Harry Bond is on the pro
gramme, first as Vanderbilt Botts, a
real estate boomer, and in the last act
is appreciated as "Wendel Phillips, a
footman. E. H. Bender as Hankins,
the engineer of the mill, and Frank
McSorley, a station agent, make up the
balance of a capable cast. . \

VOLVED IX THE BIGGEST RACTNG SCANDAL IN RECENT
YEARS ON THE CALIFORNIA TURF.
The finals of the fourth class proved
a five-set affair, the outcome of which
was in doubt until the end. Skaggs
won the first set easily. Ihe second
and third went to Guerln and it seem
ed he would win. Skaggs won the
fourth set and evened up the score.
The fifth set was the closest and final
ly'.went to Skaggs after fourteen
games had been played. The score
was 6-3. 7-5. 4-6, 6-4, 8-6.
N On the California Club courts many
practice matches were played. â¢ The
best by far was a doubles between Joe
Tobin and Will Taylor and Frank Mit
chell and Sidney. Salisbury. Taylor at
one time was the greatest player on
the coast and held the championship
for several years. He has played but
little in the past few years, but. has
not gone back much. He and Tobin
beat Mitchell and Salisbury easily. . AH
three sets went to the ex-champions
and -the losers were able to get-only
three games in each.
Mitchell and Salisbury did not play
their best, the former being consider
ably off in his play. Taylor played his
old-time, careful, heady, game. ' He
uses little or no speed, but plays every
thing safe. Tobln was strong on over
head work, but his volleying was a lit
tle weak. The score in favor of Tobin
and Taylor was 6-3, 6-3, 6-3.
In singles Salisbury and Mitchell
played one set to determine who waa
responsible for their defeat. Salisbury
beat his first-class opponent, 6-4. '
The unfinished match between Mac-
Gavin and Allen was , not played, hut
will be completed either Saturday
afternoon or Sunday.
match was called. These two players
now have two uncompleted matches to
play. In one Allen leads and in the
other MacGavin has the advantage.
The semi-final match between Mac-
Gavin and George Baker was the
closest and most interesting of the day.
MacGavin broke several strings in his
racket during the second set and j it
almost cost him the match. In the
third set Baker led at 6-5 and 40-15,
but MacGavin pulled it out, 9-7. Pre
vious to this each had won a set quite
easily. The other two matches in this
class, were won by Allen. He beat H.
Russell and Charles Dunlap in the or
der named.
In the second class both . matches
were interesting. In the semi-finals
Stewart Gayness caused a surprise by
almost beating Ambrose. Gayness had
previously . played in the third class
and his excellent showing was unex
pected. The score was 6-2, 7-9, 8-6 in
favor of Ambrose."
In ! the finals Ambrose, after losing
the first set, worr the next three, the
third being a love set. The score was
2-6, 6-4, 6-0, 6-4. \
In the third class Brabant was much
too strong for young Gabriel. The
latter became discouraged after losing
the first two sets. Brabant has an ex
cellent style and has had considerable
experience. The score in his favor
was 6-2, 6-4, 6-3. ,

Relief dogs were sent out early in the
course, for it was apparent that Spe
cial, game as he was, could not score.
The ' winner, too, was in a bad state
and about all out. When the hare was
dispatched it was found necessary to
carry Special from the field and it is
likely the game hound will succumb to
the severe running.
Following are the day's results with
Judge Thomas Tlerney* a official scores:
There waa no stopping the taxes
yesterday at Ingleslde Coursing Park.
Hardly a greyhound was slipped that
was not run to a standstill. Only the
hounds that/ had been trained for stam
ina had a chance of getting anywhere
near the flying hares.
Laughing Water. G. Lacy Crawf ortl'B
St. Louis courser, won the stake, beat
ing Special in the deciding course with
out allowing him a point. The victory
was a hard-earned one for the Eastern
dog for, like others . in the stake, she
was forced to extend herself in nearly
every trial.
Special had had more than his share
of work and before the deciding course
was ended showed the effects of hard
trials, i

he was unable to overcome the score
made' by Bremer. The prizes for the
highest score of the year consist of a

and a gold medal from Philo Jacoby. *

of the year.
BREHM TROPHY FOR GEHRET
He Is High Man of the Year in the
California Schuetzen Club.
'.The eyent'of the day was the finals
of the first ' class. Allen and Mac-
Gavin were opposed to each other, but
did not Â¦ finish as good a match as was
expected. MacGavin at times was bril
liant, but played rather a careless
game, especially when he was ahead.
Allen played his usual careful game
and scored mostly on his opponent's
outs or nets.-, MacGavah took the first
set easily .'and had â¢ the . second well In
hand," leading/ at 4f 2 and 5-4. Allen
made a Â¦ good stand Â¦ and pulled it "> out,
7-5; v He ralso won' the third set with
little trouble. . In the fourth set Mac-
Gavin was playi ng his best ; and - win
ning everything, in sight -when! the
The . unexpected happened ; in the
second class. George Janes was a
strong favorite . and many thought he
would, have little difficulty winnlngT
Norman Ambrose proved too strong
for him in the finals and won three
sets out of four. A. H. Brabant, a re
cent arrival from New. Zealand, won
the third class handily from Harry
Gabriel. In future the winner should
play in the second class. The finals
of the fourth class proved the closest
match of the day and was won by C.
S. Skaggs. / . .
â¢ The final rounds of the different
classes furnished some good tennis
yesterday at the Golden Gate Park
courts. The second, third and fourth
classes were completed, but the first
class was not quite finished. As was
expected, Drummond, MacGavin and
Will Allen met in the finals. When
time was. called Allen had a lead of
one set, but MacGavin was ahead on
games In the fourth set MacGavin
won the fijst set, 6-2;. Allen the sec
ond, ,7-5, and the third, 6-3. In the

The ruling oft! the turf of Book

one topic of conversation yesterday
among horsemen. Of. course there
were many arguments^ both pro iind
congas to the justice of -the 'rulings.
Many who a- few days; ago were
decrying the inanition displayed by
the officials at Oakland track and ap-,
parently wanted one-half the jockeys
riding either lynched or transported,
suddenly suffered a change . of mind,
and now think an injury/ has been
done. However, this is an ' old story.
A rider is an idol while he: is putting
winners over the plate, but' when he
strikes' a losing, gait his 'former wor

altogether too fast to these young

BERKELEY, Dec. 6.â The association
football game at Idora Park this after
noon between the Hornets and the Oc
cidentals ended in a tie, each side scor
ing one Doint. The Occidentals scored
their single point in the first half. It
seemed the Occidentals were going to
win with this one point, but just before
the end of the second half the Hornets
by fierce playing managed to get the
ball into the net, thus making matters
even. The line-up of the teams was as
follows:
Tie Game at Idora Park.
NEW YORK, Dec. 6. â William C.
Whitney leads the list of winning own
ers on the American turf for the sea
son of 1903, which came to an end on
Saturday with the close of the Ben
nings meeting.
Despite many disappointments', the
cutting down of his best colt. Inflex
ible, which, in the opinion of many
good judges, wjould probably have won
the Futurity, and the comparatively
few times toward the end of the sea
son when "Eton blue, brown cap,"
were seen in public, Mr. Whitney's
racers won a trifle less than 5100,000,
the exact figures being $99,405. With
two high-priced jockeys retained by
Mr. Whitney and other matters in.pro
portion, the expenses of his liberally
managed establishment leave no mar
gin of profit, especially as forfeits are
large.
The list of owners whose horses
have won $10,000 or more include
fifty-five. They have won tn the ag
gregate more than $1,631,000. An
other million j or more has been dis
tributed among the remainder of the
turfmen, about 400 in number.
The leading trainers of the year as
shown by the statistics are A. J. Joy
ner, who trained the horses of J. B.
Haggin and of Sydney Paget, which
won more than" $163,000; John. W.
Rogers, who handled the horses, of
William C. Whitney, and the West
bury stable, whose combined winnings
are $136,135; James Rowe, who was
in charge of Messrs. James R. and
Foxhall P. Keene's racers, which earn
ed $92,596; Alexander & William
Shields, whose racers, in- conjunction
with those of E. R. Thomas, have won
.$121,000, some of which, however,
must be credited to those Who preced
ed the Messrs. Shields in control of
the Thomas horses, and R. -I. Miller,
trainer for the Hampton stable, whose
colt, Africander, was the chief three
year-old stake-winner of the year. The
latter stable's winnings were $82,875;
John J. Hyland's management of Au
gust Belmont's racers earned $69,415.
Special Dispatch to The Call
/ Two of the matches of the Associa
tion Football League yesterday were
somewhat hollow affairs, the Tbistles
beating the Pickwicks 9 to 0 on the
Presidio Athletic Grounds in the morn
ing, and the Vampires winning 3 goals
to 0 against the Albion Rovers in the
afternoon on the cricket ground at
Webster street, Alameda.
In tLe Thistle versus Pickwick match
the ball was kicked off at 11 o'clock.
In a few minutes Strang kicked the
first goal, for the Thistles. A little
later a corner kick was landed right
in front of the Pickwicks* goal. Dun
can jumped in the air and headed the
ball between the posts. T. Smith kick
ed the third goal for the Thistles, the
Pickwick goalkeeper making a weak at
tempt to save. Lydon headed a fourth
goal for the Thistles, and Smith put
the ball between. the posts for the fifth
score. A hard, sharp shot by Taylor
resulted in a sixth goal for the This
tles. Duncan, from a hot scrimmage
in' front of goal, kicked a fine goal, the
seventh. Strang scored: for the eighth
time and Lydon, with a good shot along
the ground, secured a ninth point. The
Thistles were awarded a penalty kick
for hands within the penalty line. Ly
don lifted the ball over the goalkeep
er's head, but it went above the bar.
For the losers Grade at center half
and Cowan at center forward, played!
the best game, but they got little sup
port from their teammates. A. Robin
son was referee. The teams were made

The home organization celebrated its
second anniversary at the Shell Mound
Park rifle ranges yesterday with an
award of annual prizes and a banquet.
Edward Lorenzen succeeded in putting
a bullet within .008 of an inch of the
center and carried off the kingship. J.
Cobby won the championship of the
club and the Captain Siebe medal.
Hermann Huber secured the honors in
the champion class without a struggle.
R. M. Tobin of the Whites scored the
first goal of the game. Tom Driscoll
tied the score almost immediately with
a brilliant shot from a hard angle. F.
J. Carolan sent the ball between the
posts for a second goal for the Reds
just before the close of the period.
Walter McCreery worked the ball out
of a scrimmage early in the second
period and ran it down the field for a
goal with but little assistance. This
made the score a tie again. The Reds
had the ball around their opponents'
goal for some time and nearly scored.
Tom Driscoll missed a goal by inches
early in the third period and Walter

tory of the business has there not
been times oi glutted markets and "red
Ink returns" from some of the dis
tributing points, and besides the ship
ments this year were greater than ever
before by several hundred carloads. -
With a proper selection and; careful
grading of the fruit and an expedited
scheduled freight service, and with pos
sible reductions in charges Indifferent
ways from time to time, I believe that
12,000 cars of deciduous fruit can be
marketed from California with as good
or better results in the future as ever
attained in the past, and the organi
zation and maintenance of the Califor
nia Fruit Distributors is a long step to
ward that consummation.
It is a long, stride In the direction of
intelligent and practical co-operation
in the handling of one of California's
chief products, with the consequent
benefit to the whole industry and to the
State. N^MffBfjfrfllmffcBfll^^
It is only because of the splendid
carrying qualities of the California
fruits and the intelligent packing and
preparing of same that they have
been able to maintain their present
position in the various markets,', and
there is no reason why the Industry
cannot and should not be maintained

seasons. )â¢ ".'}'.'-.'Â¦:Â¦Â¦':Â¦Â¦Â¦'/ :'...Â¦Â¦} '^
The past season, by discounting the

upon the probable arrivals in the sev

sults -tfere attained. There were no
gluts or comparative oversupplles In
any of the markets and the net returns
were fairly satisfactory. How much
better they would have been with bet
ter time can only be estimated. .
PLEASING BESULTS.
The most strenuous efforts will be
put forth by the California fruit
distributors to obtain such a service,
and until such a service is had it will
not be felt that the most vital neces
sity of the business is secured or the
next most necessary reform accom
plished. Other reforms and changes
will have to and will be made, but lit
tle more can be accomplished until
this stumbling block is out of the
way.

be put on sale. It must remain^ on
the track until Monday with constant
deterioration as regards- quality,' and
consequently value, and : on. Monday
other fruit would also be due, making
an undue and relatively improper of
fering. : y â¢'-â¢ r-'.
The allottments having all been
comparatively made, If the cars that
did not arrive there Friday for sale
should be diverted to other markets,
It would throw the other markets out
of balance and the whole scheme of
distribution upset. Thus everything
depends upon transportation, for on
perishable products It is a well-known
and undeniable fact that a day lost
Is never regained, to say nothing of
deterioration and consequent loss on
shipments when to long en route.
STBENT7OUS EXEBTTONS.
The most serious problem to be
solved now ia the one of transporta
tion. Little more can be done toward
svEtemizing or Increasing the volume
of shipments until this important
matter is worked out satisfactorily.
We must have a regular as well as
an expedited service to the end that
we can know positively, barring ac
cidents,-just where a car of fruit
would be at any' given time.
About 60 per cent of the shipments
are distributed through the auction
markets. No fruit is sold In these
markets on Saturday or Sunday. Ship
ments are made from California
on every day. including Saturday and
Sunday. Suppose, for instance. - that
a certain number of cars were sent
to Chicago to arrive on in
time for the last auction sale of the
TBANSPOBT ATION NEEDS.
The saving in expense of telegraph
ing, mail, etc., much more than pays
the total expense of the organization.
The first season the endeavor was made
to direct a part of the distribution from
the Chicago office, but it did not work
satisfactorily, and this year all of the
distribution was directed from the Sac
ramento office, and the efficacy and
wisdom of this action is so manifest
and proper that I apprehend no one
will question the expediency again or
agree to any other action in the fu
ture.
The distribution of fruit to the auc
tion markets is made with the utmost
care and long experience in the busi
ness is called upon to direct what fruit
should be sent to the different mar
kets and to apportion to each market
the relative proper amount of fruit to
keep them all on a comparative equal
ity, after taking into consideration the
difference in the cost of transportation
and refrigeration charges to the dif
ferent points.
Another great benefit of united action
is the exploitation and development of
new markets. Fruit was placed this
year in no less than twenty-eight dif
ferent cities that never before had re
ceived California fruit in car load lots,
and while not all of them may prove
to be advantageous points, the most of
them undoubtedly will.
curate information of all shipments
previously forwarded, as they make all
sales, diversions and apportionments,
but they receive telegraphic informa
tion daily from all thi leading centers
stating present condition, prospective
demands, amount and variety of local
supplies and all othe*- matters perti
nent and necessary to the most intelli
gent distribution of the fruit.
They immediately stopped all private
consignments to outside points and de
termined that all fruits not sent to the
East to be sold at auction should be
sold on what Is known as the "f. o. b.
California plan." 1. e., that a minimum
price for the product should be fixed in
California and a draught for the value
of the car be drawn on the bill of
lading and manifest payable before de
llvery, of the car, and that under no
circumstances would the price agreed
upon be reduced on any shipments,
whether, sold before going or sold en
route, on any shipment leaving Califor
nia on the same day; the idea being
that the shippers when sending their
fruit to outside points should know
jast exactly what they were going to
receive for their fruit and that dealers
if they bought the fruit would be in
terested in maintaining prices rather
than cutting them; further, that those
who purchased the fruit, as long as
they had to purchase, would know that
their competitors could not buy at a
lower price than that at which they
could purchase, as it was believed that
if buyers could be guaranteed against
a decline that the business would be en
ergized and stimulated and a greater
distribution of products in the outside
markets be had, all of which has
proven to be the case.
NEW TEBBITOBY.
This condition of affairs would shift
from one point to another and the gen
eral experience was that where a mar
ket on perishable fruits once reached
a low point, unless there was a great
subsequent scarcity of that product, it
was extremely difficult to again raise
the level of prices to a profitable basis.
The formation of the California Fruit
Distributors was not an easy matter.
Some firms, because of location or supe
rior packing f>n their part or better
carrying quality of their fruit, enjoyed
advantages not common to others.
Some of them believed that if they
could keep en with prevailing methods
for a short time they could force their
competitors out of business and they
then would have the field entirely to
themselves, while all the time they
would b* likely losing money for all
concerned.
The present, general plan of operation
of the California Fruit Distributors is
cs follows: They do not purchase or
own a pound of fruit themselves, but
simply act es a clearing-house for the
different growers, shippers and asso
ciations w orking through them who
make their own carload shipments.
When a car is loaded the bill of lading
is indorsed over to the California Fruit
Distributors and is sent, together with
manifest and all pertinent information
regarding contents thereof, to the com
pany's headquarter* In Sacramento.
The car is then disposed of for the ac
count of the party loading the same.
DEFINITE BUBPOSES.
Once the bill of lading and manifest
of contents of car are received, the
management aims to place the fruit In
the best possible market for that fruit,
taking into consideration the variety,
its degree of ripeness and general
quality, and using their knowledge of
the needs, requirements and local or do
mestic supplies of the different mar
kets, together with previous shipments
as a basis of action.
Not only have they complete and ac-

tro.^d shape and the sale on a car would
bring satisfactory figures, the parties

San Luis Obispo County, with head
quarters at San Luis Obispo, for the
purpose of engaging in the business of

been farming 400 to 600 acres of land.
He hopes soon to be farming in this

if; ;Â¦ printed in English, that a San
South Africa offers an inviting and
ever increasing field for the sale of can

and the Pacific Coast has contributed
to the quantities shipped there, yet it
is known that the majority of the
business in these commodities is
not done direct with the importers in
South Africa, b'ut in many cases
through â¢ English houses, with the re

and possibly lower prices to the local

factured articles,' the < United States Is
yet young in comparison -"with Eng-.
land and continental Europe, and
many of the methods of the older
countries of acquiring arid .keeping
foreign trade are worthy of emula
tion by many United States export
ers.
England and Germany hold the
larger share of the trade of South
America through the branch houses
.of, London, Liverpool and -'Hamburg
firms ' located at the principal ports
of that continent. . These - branch
houses know the trade requirements
of each country, -comply with 1 them;
grant liberal terms of credit and in
turn\, preserve 'the ; balance of -\ trade
with/ their home countries by export
ing to. them* the raw. products 'of South
America, some of -' which actually
reach the United States via European
ports/ .'.-,
MUST HA VE. GOODS.
The annual imports by China of can
dles of various sizes, colors and weights
are valued at $300,000, and the inhabit
ants of the Philippine Islands consume
each year importations of the same ar
ticle valued at $125,000. California pro
duces the raw materials of excellent
quality and at low cost reauired in
the manufacture of candles, yet our
manufacturers have not yet seen fit
to cater to this trade by providing new
appliances required in the production
of the size and quality of candles de
sired by the consumers in China and
the Philippines, but are content to leave
the field clear to the manufacturers in
England, Belgium, Germany and Spain.
The demand for foreign beer and
wine in China is increasing rapidly, and
last year the importations were valued
at $885,000, yet England, Germany and
France provided the greater part of
these articles and Japan provided a
large and Increasing quantity of beer,
while the United States contributed
but $100,000. in the value of these prod
ucts shipped to that country.
FIELD IN AFRICA.
abroad should stimulate California dai
rymen to renewed- activity and enlarge
operations to permit their sharing in
the trade of foreign markets contigu
ous to this port.

A SURE TEST
Of Whether Coffee Really Hurts or
Not.
Some folks drink coffee and suffer
Kday after day, but console themselves
by paying, "I don't believe it hurts me,
or at any rate I am not sure that it
does."
The sensible thing to do is to make
sure by leaving off coffee and using
Postum for a week or so. The trial
is pleasant and you may learn some-
thing worth more than money to you
in the way of health and strength.
An Intelligent woman, who valued
her health and comfort, made sure.
She says: "I have proved positively
that when I used coffee I had kidney
and bladder trouble, palpitation of the
heart, stomach trouble, insomnia and
my complexion was sallow and muddy,
but I got rid of all these troubles when
I quit coffee and took on Postum Food
Coffee. All my troubles disappeared
quickly, almost as if by magic and in
their place I became strong' and well.
"I soon learned to like Postum as
well as I ever liked coffee and I would
>not exchange my delicious cup of Pos-
;um for coffee and sickness for any-
thing in the world." Name given by
Postura.Co., Battle Creek. Mich.
Look in each package for a copy of
the famous little book, "The Boad to
Wellvilie."THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY/ DECEMBER. 7, 1903.

There were cries of "No, no!" when
this heresy was uttered, and although
Janes explained and reiterated that he
did not intend to belittle Nelson and his
deeds, but meant that the keynote
should be, "Down with yesterday, up
wixh to-day and to-morrow," the
members as a whole failed to grasp his
meaning and his speech was not entire
ly concluded.
The British Navy League -held a
meeting October 21 at which F. T. Janes,
the best all-around^ naval critic in
England, made some remarks that
rather staggered his hearers and were
not kindly received. Mr. Janes only.re
cently joined the league in order, as
he explained, to express his views on
what he considered its faults. He
thought the Navy League had too much
Nelson, and related a conversation he
had overheard aboard ship between
two bluejackets, one of them saying:
"What is this: 'England expects that
every man this day . will do his
duty* ?"
/ "That is what Nelson said."
"Oh, blow Nelson!" retorted the other
sailor. "We live to-day, not yesterday."

Commandants in British dockyards,
or, as they are designated,- admiral su
perintendents, are, allowed greater dis
cretion and responsibility than similar
officials in the United States navy
yards. There is a rule in British dock
yards which lays down that the annual
wages shall.be apportioned into fifty
two equal parts and expended exactly
each week, whether the yard has
much or little work to do, i,and this
rule, of course, militates Seriously
against the efficiency and output of .the
yard. Admiral Henderson of the Dev/
onpbrt dockyard, is evidently j a thor
ough business man and a wide-awake
administrator, for he has discarded this
absurd rule and spends the money with
due regard to the exigencies of the
service, which lately, enabled, him to
prepare for sea. six battle-ships and
cruisers in six weeks, well within the
specified limit of time and cost. The
proper distribution of expenditure; of. a
lump sum over a period of fifty-two
weeks involves some labor and requires
good judgment on the part of ; the ; of
ficial in charge, while an evenly dis
tributed outlay, for .each week, reduces
the superintendent's responsibility ma
terially. ">>i 'Â¦ ' v :

The Naval Board on the boilers of
the! Maine expresses, the opinion that
the Niclausse boilers are fully equal to
the work they are designed to do, and
see/ no reason why they should not
continue to do . this wqrk, provided
they are .given the care" necessary for
the efficiency of any water-tube boiler.
This and offter" boilers of the water
tube type, the board concludes, calls
for. more brain work, and at the same
time ; less physical effort, on the part
of the firemen, j
with such a trivial obstruction as the
handrail / of the submarine \ boat Is
somewhat difficult to believe, and
other more .reasonable explanations

SHIPS WITHOUT TORPEDOES.
In the designs made in 1^99-1900
of six battle-ships and six armored
cruisers provision was made for two
submerged torpedo-tubes and their
requisite complement and outfit for N
each ship, but when Chief Constructor
Hichborn was retired in 1901, having
reached , the age limit, his successor
caused the torpedo arrangement to be
eliminated. As a consequence these
twelve ships and four battle-ships and
armored \ cruisers subsequently de
signed are without torpedoes and
must 'depend solely upon their guns
for attack and defense. There Is not
an armored ship nor' protected cruiser
in any other navy that has not from
six to two torpedo-tubes, and while
expert opinion may differ as to the ad
visability ; of above-water tubes there
can be no question about the import
ance of submerged tubes. It appears,
however, that the Board of Construc
tion quite recently realized the notable
deficiency in our ships and- in the de
sign of the two 13,000-ton battle-ships
two submerged torpedo-tubes are pro
vided for, and it is further contem
plated to again introduce them in the
sixteen ships now under construction.
In - this* interval, Â¦ from the time the
contracts were let up to the present
time" new plans have been made as a
result of the removal of the torpedo
tubes, arid these,- together with such
work as the contractor may have per
formed, will again have to be changed,
involving great cost, loss of time and
confusion. It is such indefinite ac
tion on the part of the Navy Depart
ment, that causes much of the delay in
the completion of ships for which the
contractor is unjustly charged.

noon.
Lehmann and Edward Sellon, the
last named IS years of age and living
at 1641 Taylor street, hired a boat on
Saturday night to go duck hunting.
They rowed to near the Six Mile
House and Lehmann was putting out
the decoy when his shotgun, which
xras lying on the bottom of the boat,
was accidentally discharged, and the
contents lodged in his left leg' below
the knee, badly shattering the bones.
Sellon rowed the boat ashore, ran
to the milk ranch of Joseph Roberts,
Â¦which was close to the shore, and
notified him of the accident to his
boy friend. Roberts quickly hitched
a horse to a light wagon and drove
rapidly with the wounded boy and
his friend to the South San Francisco
Police Station. There the ' Southern
Police Station m-as informed by tele
phone of the accident and the patrol
wagon was sent to take the boy to the
Central Emergency Hospital.
The wounded boy had been suffer
ing great pain and loss of blood, and
when he reached the hospital he was
very weak. His parents were ap
prised of the accident, and later they
had him removed to the German Hos
pital, where he died yesterday after
noon and the Morgue officials were
notified. At the request of the boy's
father the body was sent to an under
taking establishment.
Carl Lrehraann. an electrical appren
tice, 17 years of age, who lived at
1437 Pine street, was accidentally
shot while in a boat near the Six
Mile House shortly after midnight
yesterday morning: ; and died at the
Germany Hospital yesterday after-
Many of ,the: small restaurants
will not close. T"he proprietors of the
various Italian restaurants .in the
downtown districts- all attended the
meeting and, while they are not mem
bers " of the association, still > they all
agreed to close, their places of business.
It is hard to say just how many res
taurants-will close their doors, as not
one-half of the owners Delons ; to the
association. Nevertheless, their sym
pathies are with the association, and 4n
all probability many of them- will not
open for business this morning. -V;
"He rang me up on Saturday and*
asked me about, the situation and I
told him how matters, stood. I also
added -that it was too late then to do
anything' in-the matter, as the agree
ment had been broken when the crew of
an Eddy-street restaurant had been
called; out. He; was to act at the ar
batrator, but he can do nothing now,
and the battle will have to be fought
out between the cooks and waiters arid
the assocfatlonl" ..'-/'.'
The cooks and waiters were all re
ticent regarding - the approaching
strike. At the headquarters : of each
union silence prevailed, and the heads
of the two unions > stated that they
would simply wait till some time in
thenear future before doing anything
to adiiist the difficulty.
Chairman Johnson of the Rtstaurant
keepers' Association said last night that
the Â¦ restaurant men intended to fight
the union to a finish now that the,
agreement was broken. "They have
broken faith," said Johnson, "and they
will have to stand the consequences.
We have done all-in our power to set
tle the difficulty, but without result, so
the" matter 'will have to take its course.
"I do^not know when we, will open up
for business again, but we will prob
ably decide that at a meeting . which
will be held this afternoon. I tried to
communicate with Mayor Schmitz
when the. trouble first arose last Fri
day, but was not successful.
' MAYOR IS HELPLESS.
FIGHT TO A: FINISH.
The various eating-houses through
out the ' city that belong to the Res
taurant-Keepers' Association did not
close last night, as it was ex
pected.they would, but when the hun
gry man tries to secure his breakfast
in one of them this morning; he will
be forced to turn away without appeas
ing his appetite" or else beg a "hand
out" from some kind housewife, for the
association decided yesterday _ after
noon that they would not open their
dining-rooms this morning. Â¦
-Â¦Just how many of the eating-houses
will close is not known, but it can
safely 'be said that more" than 100, and
possibly twice that will obey
the order of r the association. When
the restaurants do open up they, ?ill
do_ so as "open houses," or in other
words they will employ union or non
union help, as they see fit.
The restaurant men held a "> secret
session yesterday afternoon, which
lasted for two hours, and .when it came
to an end Chairman Johnson said the
members had agreed not to open this
morning.^ This will include the large
French restaurants, as they all belong
to the association, ; with the exception
of three, and the proprietors of . these
places have agreed to . take the same
stand as the association.
