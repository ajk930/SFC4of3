"His attention having been called to a

with Russia, Mr. Gogoro : Takahira, the
Japanese Minister, states that while there
is some disquiet due to the unsettled state
of affairs which has existed so long* in
the Far East, it seems that It has .been
aggravated more recently bythe unfound

WASHINGTON. Oct. 12.â Aside from
extensive military preparation by both
nations, the Japanese legation here is not
advised that either Russia or Japan has
as yet committed any act of- war. The
Japanese Minister Is being kept constant
ly advised by cablegrams from Tokio of
the situation, and, realizing Its gravity,
he is moving with great caution. The
negotiations between Russia and Japan,
according to his advices, are still in pro

settlement of the questions at issue. The

regarding recent developments and ru
mors of war over Manchuria. v .
As has often 'been pointed .out, the
United States has no cause of protest be
cause Russia has failed to keep her
pledges that she would evacuate Manchu
ria on October 8. . The interest 'of the
United States in Manchuria is covejed by,
the recent treaty between China' and this
country. If Manchuria becomes annexed
to Russia or continues under Russian con
trol the United States "will. Insist that the
provisions of the treaty be carried out,
especially as Russia assented to Its pro
visions previous to its being signed^ 'â¢
It is believed here thai an understand
ing exists between Germany and Russia
in regard to operations in Manchuria, and
that no protest nor even disapproval will
be expressed by Germany over any.course
Russia may pursue in China. France Is
apparently disinterested, and. Great Brit
ain is believed to be the only, country
that Is vitally interested and opposed to
the course of Russia in Manchuria. /
At the Russian embassy the officials are
not alarmed over the situation in the Far
East. The view held there is that neither
Russia* nor: Japan desires^ war,' .though
both may be making preparations to that
end, and that there is , really, no question
at issue which | cannot be solved without
recourse to arms, provided the negotiating
parties are 1 disposed ~; to use 'Â¦ diplomacy
rather than the sword. The embassy has
received no advices from St. Petersburg
in more than two weeks. ,V.
BERLIN, Oct. 12.â The relations between
Japan and Russia have reached a crisis,
according to the official view here. The
exact nature of the diplomatic exchanges
between the two governments that
brought about the present intensity ap
pears to be unknown at the legations of
the two countries here or at the German
legations in St. Petersburg and Tokio, al
though it is understood that Great Britain
is privy to Japan's movements.
BT. PETERSBURG. Oct. 12.âSignific

Official Messenger and the Journal de St.
Petersburg print the Berlin Lokal An

Ramapo ri\-er. after rising higher than
ever before, bo far as existing records
show, and sweeping away many Email

Observer A. W. Drinkwater of the Cur
rituck reached Norfolk to-day by the in
land route and reported the loss of the
schooners Mabel Rice and J. W. Holden
Thursday and Friday. The life-savers had
seen the Rice about 2 p. m. on Saturday,
with her crew In the rigging, but 6he
was then two miles out at sea and noth
ing could be done for her. At 4 o'clock
the life-Â«avcrs had succeeded in stretch
ing a line across the wreck and rescued
the captain and crew of seven men. It
is estimated that the cargo of lumber car
ried by the schooner Rice was worth more
than $50,000.
The three-masted schooner J. B. Holden
of Suffolk is ashore near False Cape, Va.,
and Is a total loss. Her" captain, W. O.
Cranmer of Suffolk, and her crew were
taken off by the life-savers. The Holden
was "heavily laden with lumber, and at
tempts to save at least a portion of the
cargo will be made.
NORFOLK, Va.. Oct. 12.â The first news
from the Carolina coast since the begin

the hepe that the treacherous shoals be
tween Currituck and Hatteras have not
claimed their quota of missing craft.
Two vessels are known to have been lost
on that stretch of the coast and further
reports are expected to bring news of
more wrecks, as at this time three
schooners are missing, with one barge.
CEEWS LOST WITH SCHOONERS.
Late Reports Add to Disasters on the
Virginia Coast.
Incoming steamers from European and
coastwise ports to-day reported extÂ«mely
etormy weather during the last three
days. The steamer City of Savannah, wiTn
fifty-four passengers, came into port with
*l heavy list caused by h^r cargo shifting.
Heavy seas broke over her bridge. The
forward ventilators were swept away in
the storm, deadlights were smashed in
and the water poured into the saloon.
TrafSc was resumed during the day on
all the railroad lines entering New York,
with the exception of the local service on
the main line of the Erie. The milk fnm
ine in the city was broken by the arrival
of the usual number of milk trains on
th* West Shore, New York Central, L-ack
uwar.na and othÂ«r roads.
To-rJght the water is reported to have
fallen four feet below the highest mark
and the only possible source of damage
would be the bursting of the great water
mains, which were undermined by the
flood. The distress continues great and
to-night fully 500 persons were still com
pelled to seek food and shelter in the ar
mory. No additional fatalities were re
ported throughout the day.
In Passalc the damage is estimated to
be at least equal to that in Paterson.
Many adjacent villages still were under
water to-day, but Â¦with the falling of tlie
waters all danger of a collapse of the
great Dundee dam was declared to be
past.
NEW YORK. Oct. 12.â With the reports
of receding floods received to-day from
all quarters, Paterson. Passaic and tSe
other water-swept towns of New Jersey

extent of the devastation.
In Paterscn alone the damage to prop

ing Into account the loss in wages to the
thousands who have been temporarily
deprived of occupation by shutting down
of factories.

"For his own part. Mr. Takahlra said,

70KI0, Oct. i3wâ 'Japan will unflinchingly uphold its Monroe doctrine," said a high - official of 'the
Mikado's Government to-day. When asked precisely what that doctrine meant the official said:
"Any infringement of the political or territorial integrity of . Korea by a foreign nval that involves
che ultimate destruction of our country cannot be tolerated. I do not think any Japanese statesman, cer
tainly none occupying a position of authority, ever affirmed, either openly or privately, that Japan is likely, to.
be called on to go to war to dispossess Russia of Manchuria. .To be sure we should be easier in our minds and
should entertain higher regard for Russian diplomatic probity if the St. Petersburg Government were to march
its troops out of China. Manchuria, however, is not necessarily a matter of life or death, as we can live and
grow without its passing back into the hands of China.
"With Korea it is different. That country must either remain independent or else become Japanese. For
that principle we fought China, and that principle we cannot relinquish, though the Muscovite forces us to war.
"Our people are eager to take any risk they deem necessary for the nation's honor and existence. - Happily
they cannot compel premature action. The prerogative of declaring war and making peace rests with the Em
peror, whose enlightened mind and cool judgment are, perhaps, Japan's most valuable possession.
"Moreover, his Majesty's advisers are not only men of conservative principle, but also men who are aware
of the vast potentialities of the Muscovite power. Hence war will come upon the hands of Japan only when
Russia, discarding diplomatic artifice, begins to throw considerable bodies of troops across Yalu River."

told the doctor* his mother was seriously

W.. WASHINGTON, Oct. 12âDe-Dite In
timations which have come from Post
office Department officials to the effect
that the investigation of the scandal has
been about completed, it is learned to
night that the President has given orders
for Fourth Assistant Postmaster General
Bristow and the inspectors to continue
their inquiry into every division where
there has been a chance for wrongdoing.
The President is not only determined that
the investigation shall be thorough, but
will take pains to let it be Known that
every branch of the postal service has
been cleaned. *
It Is announced that the order from
the White House to continue the probing
cannot be taken as an - indication' that
the President is dissatisfied with the work
already performed. This, he believes, has
been welUdone, but he wishes it to con
tinue to other, branches. Some criticism
has been made of the investigation be
cause thus far it has only achieved cer
tain results. While the administration
feels that the criticism is unfounded the
position now taken by the President will
put an end to all gossip of that character.
It may not be that , any. inore indict
ments will be reported, but . it . is said
that a continuation of the investigation
will expose many , methods i use'd by cer
tain employes which,' though not crim
inal, will result in wholesale discharges
from' the service. It is said that the at
tention of inspectors has Deen called to
a number of cases in the West which will
be 'investigated.
The new order from the White House
will -have '., the effect, It 18 believed, of
strengthening the administration and les
sening the chance of political cupital be
ing made of the postoffice case. It| is.
said the President remarked ;at a meet
ing T that the administration had the in
vestigation on its hands and should com
plete it bo that no other party could ever
find anything to do.

This change, the department: shows, Is
brought about largely by. the decrease of
mortality In . the - summer. Care 1$ ; the
greatest life-saver. -
An 'improved milk supply, the anti-toxin
treatment of diphtheria and other causes often
cited to account . for the decrease of infant
mortality are equally inadequate and the .. de
partment is disposed to attach more impor
tance to.- the education of mothers 'In tha
hygiene of the young. .The efforts of women's
clubs and. similar: organizations In this educa
tion , have been steadily growing Â¦ during Â¦ all
this period of decreasing infant mortality, and
It . is believed Â¦? this Is . the principal : factor Â¦ in
giving the ' baby a better chance for lfe.
In 1891 there were 8208 deaths of infants
less ; than 1 year of age. In 1902 there
were 0144 infant deaths. jlgft
CHICAGO, Oct. 12.â The death rate of
Chicago infants less than 1 year of age
has decreased 60.1 per" cent since 1891. The
death rate of persons of allages has de
creased 39.2 per cent in the eamc' twelve
years. The statements are made in the
weekly bulletin' of the Health Department.
Speaking of the causes favorable to pre
vention of infant mortality, the bulletin
says:

"The situation in Canada, where there
is a transcontinental line, Is different.
There it is a British Government war
measure to have a railroad, over whloh
troops can be rushed from dcean to ocean,
and there is no territory crossed by com
peting lines such as a transcontinental
line would go through here."
Stubbs says the aggregate expenditures
of all the companies will be greatly in
creased by appropriations for work now
under way, and is more than the total
estimated expenditures for the comple
tion of the Panama canal. Despite the
fact that more than $46,000,000 has been
spent in the past three years for new lo
omotives and cars, the volume of traffic
to-day Is greater than the facilities of the
Harrlman lines for handling it. This is
especially true of the Southern Paciflc.
The. Union Paciflc. is perhaps In the best
shape so far as equipment is concerned,
but it has no surplus of cars or engines.
The traffic and operating officials of the
Harriman system have been conferring
recently as to the methods to* be em
ployed to get the best results possible
from the vast expenditures which have
been made for, equipment. Having spent
so many millions in reducing grades and
curves, for engines of increased power
and cars of large capacity, Harriman ex
pects the traffic operating officials to
pull together, properly assort the traffic
and have It moved so far as possible In
full cars both ways, as well as in full
trainloads. A standard has been adopted
for all equipment to be used '.by the Har
riman lines, that there may be no trouble
or delay In the Interchange of cars with
through trains.
Talk of an Erle*Alton-UnIon Paciflc
deal, by . which a transcontinental line
would come Into being, was revived in
Wall street to-day, but the story met
with denials from men In a position to
know If anything of the sort were pend
ing. One man said that the establishment
of such a line would be neither wise 'nor
good for the railroad business. He added:
ment for the Harriman railroad
system, according to an official estimate
made by J. C. Stubbs, traffic director of
the system. The estimate shows that of
this amount $26,369,009 was expended on
the Union Pacific and $42,980,353 on the
Southern Pacific.

LONDON. Oct. 12.â Joseph Chamberlain
is now resting at Highbury, his residence
in Birmingham, and- is not engaged to
speak for another fortnight. ! He will util
ize the . interval to elaborate his scheme
and prepare a reply to the objections
raised by his opponents. Meanwhile the
fiscal campaign is being vigorously pur
sued In the country. Speeches wiM be de
livered daily, by political leaders, particu
larly of the Liberal party.
Chamberlain's reference to the tin plate
Industry has been strongly criticized, the
experts pointing out that though the trade
with the United States has decreased
.there Is a great" Increase In the number
of mills working Â¦ in Great Britain, and
the trade is flourishing. -.
Sir John J. Jenkins, formerly Liberal-
Unionist member of Parliament for Car
marthen and chairman of the Swansea
Metal Exchange, Bpeaklng for the Swan
sea harbor trust to-night, said that the
alarmist reports as to the condition of the
tin trade were unwarranted. The first
nine months of the present year, com
pared with two years ago, showed an. in
crease of. 18,000 tons. No tin plate bars
had been imported since early in 1901,
proving that Wales was able "to compete
satisfactorily with the world and was able
to supply^ bars at a rate which gave no
encouragement to American "dumping."
Sir Henry Fowler, Liberal, addressed a
big and enthusiastic meeting to-night in
; St. Andrew's Hall, Glasgow, where Cham
! berlain began his fiscal campaign. Lord
: Tweedmouth presided, and Sir Henry
Fowler read a cordial letter from Lord
Rosebery sympathizing with the objects
of the meeting.
Sir Henry Fowler delivered a strong
free trade speech, declaring that the
country was stronger to-day than ever
before financially. He ridiculed Chamber
lain's contention of declining trade, and
asserted that the colonies needed no bribe
to keep within the empire. He had no
tears to waste on the iron and tin plate
trades, he said. Where one door was shut
on a British industry another was opened.
The country was well able to hold its own
In the present commercial struggle.
Austen Chamberlain, the new Chancel
lor of the Kxchequer, replying to a vote
of congratulation at Acocks Green,
Worcestershire, 'of his parliamentary con-^
stituency to-night, said he regretted that"
the new issues had lost the Government
some valued supporters, and declared j
himself in harmony with Balfour's prc-j
gramme as outlined at Sheffield. There
was a great danger,, he said, in compla
cently assuming that Great Britain's fis
cal policy needed no revision. He declared
that it was against all the canons of
sound finance that the Income tax, the na
tion's first reserve in time of war, should
stand at 11 pence in time of peace.
The younger Chamberlain announced
that the Government would not dissolve
until the lessons of the South African
War Commission report had been applied
and the War Office reorganized.
.The foregoing -interesting announcement
confirms the general Impression that it is
the Government's intention to meet Par
liament and proceed with business, leav
ing the fiscal problem alone as far as any
attempt at legislation Is concerned. This
idea is shared by James Bryce, M. P.,
who at Tunbridge Wells to-night ex
pressed the belief that there would be no ;
general -election until Chamberlain was ,
ready. The Government, he said, seemed
to be divided between the fear of Cham
berlain and the fear of the electorate.
Lord Stanley, the new Postmaster Gen
eral, in a speech at Bplton. declared him
self in favor of Balfour's Sheffield pro
gramme, but opposed Chamberlain's food,
taxing project.
Ritchie, late Chancellor of the Ex
chequer, has written a letter in explana
tion of his recent speech. He says: â¢
* Mr. Chamberlain proposed the retention of
the shilling grain tax in order that it might be
remitted in favor of Canada. It was not to the
retention of the tax that I objected, had my
colleagues desired it, but to the introduction of
a fundamental change of fiscal policy Involved
by preferential treatment.
Â¦ May I add that when I spoke of possible dif
ficulties between the United States and Canada
I was proceeding to say that the United States
might punish Canada by refusing free entrance !
to her harbors of | Canadian wheat, for ship
ment to Great Britain, if Canadian wheat en-
Joyed preference In our markets, but there was
bo much lnterrustlon that I was unable to
complete my sentence. Doubtless It would
have been better to use the word "penalize"
than "punish," but "I think had my sentence
been completed It would not have been open to
the , objections which have been made to that
portion of my speech. , â¢
The secret of Burfs success lies in his
extraordinary working capacity and his
intimate practical knowledge of railroad
work. He is a capable railroad engineer
as well as a manager, as the immense
task of straightening out the once
crooked right of way of the Union Pacific
will testify to. He leaves nothing to sub
ordinates. Every detail of the business
raeses directly through his hands. HIS
highest officials are mere factotems. Burt
5s everything from general manager to
train dispatcher. Every employe knows
that nothing he does or fails to do es
capes the vigilant attention of the "old
man," and no excuse for failure will be
accepted.
A quarter of a century of loyal service
to the road cuts no figure with the presi r
dent. His dealings with employes are on
a basis that admits of no sentiment, but
dollars and cents. Never in the history
of Western railroading, the experts say,
has so much work been done at so little
expense to the stockholders as on the
Union Pacific during the last four yeara.
That such a policy should Inspire an
tagonism followed as a matter of course.
The recent bollermakers' strike is noth
ing more than a symptom of this senti
ment The men had no grievance that
could not be adjusted In five minutes,
but they wanted to injure Burt. On the
ether hand Burt welcomed the oppor
tunity to rid the road of a class of em
ployes who had grown old in the ser
vice of the road so as to fill the places
with young men.
Burt Is as unique in his personal tastes
as in his management of a railroad. He
takes little recreation. His only fad is
music. He has a fair tenor voice and is
a passable performer on the flute. His
most notable characteristic Is his devotion
to his pianola. He was the first person
in Omaha to own one. Two have beeit
worn out and a third is in ser Ice. Two
pianos have succumbed to his powerful
manipulation in the last four years. He
is fond of entertaining friends at pianola
concerts. He Is a gracious entertainer at
home, tut his 6ocial elde Is a mystery al
the Union Pacific headquarters. As presi
dent of the road he never was known to
pmlle. His greatest antipathy is for
newspapers. No reporter ever inter
viewed him twice.
Among the men whom the great rail
road development of the last few years
has brought to the front President Burt
is at once a unique and prominent fig
ure. Few men holding responsible posi
tions present more striking characteris
tics than this grim, unsmiling autocrat,
under whose masterful rule the biggest
railroad system of the West has been re
organized and made a gold mine for its
stockholders.
OMAHA, Oct. 12.â The rumor in railroad
circles that Mr. Harrlman is about to
extend the authority of President Burt
of the Union Pacific Railroad over the
Southern Pacific la In striking contrast to
those that prevailed when Harrlman first
obtained control of the Union Paciflc a
Tew years ago.
At that time it was no secret that Burt
was not on the Harriman calling list. It
v.as believed by those closest to the New
York magnate that he would lose no time
in cutting the string connecting Presi
dent Burt with the Union Pacific sys
tem. If Harriman had such an intention
hÂ«? was captivated before its execution by
the eplendid work done by President Burt
in reorganizing and improving the sys
tem. Harriman is not the sort of man to
allow personal inclinations to stand in the
way of business advantages.
80 11 occurred that while Harriman's
attitude was' chilly to the point of dis
courtesy; while he even went so far as
to neglect to notify the president of Ihe
l"nlon Pecif.e when he made a visit to
Omaha, he never found the man who
could do the required work better than
President Burt. ' So it came about that
President Burt remained and it is now
said by men close to the chief executive
or the Union Pacific that his authority
is to be extended and his prestige in
creased by the man who was at first be
lieved to be only too anxious to secure
his resignation.

Gibbons to-night gave out a translation
of the brief of Pope Pius X relative to

in which the Pope says:
The condition of the University of "Washing
ton has enlisted our- deepest sympathy and
concern. Inasmuch as the report recently sub
mitted by your eminence deposes that Its af
fairs are not altogether so encouraging- as we
could wish. It is meet that we should follow
the. example of our predecessor In the further
ance of noble projects, more specially such as
ara of great moment and hold out the promise
of large advantage. In this spirit we are
pleased to continue, and. as far as may be, to
Increase In the exercise of apostolic office tha
interest which we have ever cherished toward
this distinguished American foundation.
Wherefore we learn with genuine satisfac
tion that the Bishops urged, with the ap
proval of all others Interested in its welfare,
that a collection be taken up in all the
churches throughout the United States an
nually for ten years on the first Sunday of-Ad
vent or the first convenient Sunday thereafter
with a view of enhancing the dignity and en
larging the influence of this noble seat of
. le T I hi l 9 3^lan. the result of their Joint delibera

fore 'our earnest wish and prayer that all the
Bishops of the country. Â»Â» well as tho faithful
who have at heart the progress of learning and
religion, should labor strenuously for the good
of the university. "

It was the general opinion that tha re
ductions eo far made indicated no actual
falling off in business, but rather a step
on the part of the railroads to prepare
for a possible dull day in the future.
Asked if the coincident reduction of the
chop forces by the great railroads indi
cated action against organized labor, this
reply waa made:
"It will simplify the labor situation and
make it more easily handled."
A director of the- Southern Pacific said
to-day:
"Now that there are signs of a slacken
ing in business I see no reason why we
should not take advantage of the situa
tion we have created, and this means that
we can get along with fewer men."
In reducing their force of machinists,
it was explained by the railroad traffic
officials, the New York Central, the Erie,
the Pensylvania and the Southern Pa
cific were merely returning to the normal
demand for labor. Owing to the unpre
cedented improvements made by the great
railroads throughout the country this
class of labor had been Increased during
the last three years from 10 to 20 per cent
and reductions could now be made with
out Injury to the railroads.
SIMPLIFIES LABOR SITUATION.
"Every man. that is not absolutely
essential will have to seek Â¦wfcrk else
where. Our road is in very* good shape
and we can afford to lay off a great
many men."
roads, for economical- causes,
will lay off thousands of workmen. The
sudden desire 'for retrenchment, coming
as it does from many systems, would seem
to Indicate a preconcerted plan. It was
announced to-day that as a step toward
entrenchment and in a measure to recoup
losses from the flood, the Erie Railroad
officials have decided to cut down their
force. Many men are to be discharged
from the repair shops and from the main
tenance of way corps. An official of the
Erie said to-day:
NEW YORK, Oct. 12.â Reports
from various sections of the
country, from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, indicate that many rail-
BUFFALO. N. Y., Oct 12.â The order
to reduce the force of shopmen on the
Vanderbilt system has caused the dis
charge of about 500 employes at Buffalo
and Depew.
CLEVELAND, Oct. 12.â At the head
quarters of the Lake Shore Railroad here
to-day It was said that probably not more
than 400 'ben would be dismissed by the
company as a result of the order sent out
from New York on Saturday tc reduce
the force In all shops on the Vanderbilt
system wherever possible. One hundred
and llfty of the G90 men employed in the
Lake Shore shops at Collinwood were dis
charged to-day and an equal number
probably will be dismissed at Elkhart,
Ind.
President Newman has endeavored to
create a feeling of security among em
ployes and the present movement will be
carried out with the idea of doing as lit
tle injustice as possible. The fact re
mains, however, that the heads of de
partments here have received orders to
slash payrolls and a period of extreme
unrest prevails among employes in every
branch ol the Vanderbilt service.
A Philadelphia special to the â¢ World
says: "Early and large reductions in the
number of employes of the big railroad
systems of the, country are predicted t>y
officials of the Vanderbilt lines. When
asked whether the Pennsylvania Railroad
had materially reduced the number of
men on its payrolls or contemplated such
action General Manager Atterbury said:
'We have not reduced our force very
much and only as the exigencies of the
service have required.' No men have been
laid off yet by the Philadelphia nnd Read
ing Railroad, whose traffic continues'
heavy. When the curtailment comes It
Is likely to be In the shops and among
the track hands first."
Michigan Central and the' Lake Shore
railroads are on the "anxious seat" as
a result of the announcement of a policy
of retrenchment covering the entire Van
derbllt system. It was stated by Super
intendent Everett of the New York Cen
tral's Buffalo division that the reduction
was merely an annual economic action
made necessary by a slackening- of traf
fic. This statement is flatly contradicted
in other cuarters. It is asserted on high
authority that while a slight decrease in
freight transportation may be looked for
the real reason for the radical reduction
is found in a change of policy by the
Vanderbilt management.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 12.â Kyrle Bellew
presented his new play from Hornung's
story, "Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman."
for the first time in Washington at the
new National Theater to-night before a
large audience, including many notables
of the capital. Raffles, the gentleman

NEW YORK. Oct. 12.â The new 3Lyrtc
Theater on Forty-second street, between
Broadway and Seventh avenue, was
opened to the public to-night by Richard
Mansfield in the German play "Old Hei

The play was another triumph of Mans
field's productive ability, and was char
acterized by the extraordinary beauty of
detail that marks all of his s'. lge work.
The supporting company was excellent in
every particular.
PARIS. Oct. 12.â The reading of Paul
Hervieu's new play, entitled "Le De
dales." at the Comedle Francalse brought
about a reconciliation between the actor
Le Bargy and Jules Claretle, the director
of the Comedle Francaise. the former
apologizing for his recent insulting let
ter to M. Claretie. who thereupon with
drew M. Le Bargy's suspension from th*
council of the theater. M. Le Bargy will
appear in the new piece, the staging or
which will begin to-morrow.
The remedy for this, as I Â»ee it. is to real
ize that matrimony Is a state, not a contract,
and divorce must be stopped. Divorce strikes
at the virtue of our Â¦women, and this virtue
Is what preserves the state. Divorce Is the
one foul growth upon our soil and upon Its
riddance depends the fate of our future. .
If we are to choose between divorces and
polygamy, give us polygamy.
NEW YORK. Oct. 12.â In an address
before the Knights of Columbus, gathered
in Carnegie Hall to celebrate the anniver
sary of America's discovery^ W. Bourke
Cockran reviewed the march of civiliza
tion, and declared that the only blot to
be seen at the present day Is the divorce
practice. The great private fortunes he
considered to be of value to the nation,
while the labor problem,' he said, is only
a step in the march of progress. Said he:
There has been growth since the beginning
or the world; progress is the law of the uni
verse.^-and the nations who came before this
one, the men who lived and accomplished
things before Columbus were simply the links
In a chain which has not yet been completed.
When vÂ» e l:now that this work Is all for man
kind then we can understand that his was a
mission of commerce and of religion, and that
mission marked the dawn of .Justice.
The present condition of society here is full
of promise. AVe have the greatest fortunes
of the earth â greater than Rome ever dared
dream of â and. though philosophers say that
where wealth accumulates men decay. I see no
cause for despair. When a large fortune la
not gained by robbery, by fraud or by tho
manipulation of the laws, then it can be but
a boon to the nation. My neighbor's prosper
ity Increases my own and that of the earth.
Nor do modern fortunes tend to the In
crease of luxury. On the contrary, men be
come more self-denying. I see no sign of de
cay in the human race here. The labor ques
tion is In process of solution and every row
is a step toward this. A laborer cannot get
more pay than the value of his product, for
then the product ceases to be made. Nor
can he get much less, because of the element
of competition. The laborer of to-day Is not
a servant, but a partner of his employer, and
their good rests in a mutual understanding.
But the blot I see upon our civilization is
the Increasing number of divorces. In tho
ancient state the supreme Importance of life
was to Increase the Importance of the state.
To-day the end of life is the individual good.
But the Individual good lies In the prosperity
of the family and It Is at this that the di
vorce strikes. If not checked It will destroy
the family. â¢
LONDON, Oct. 12.â The Archbishop of
Canterbury has issued an appeal urgently
representing the necessity tor subscrip

It is reported that Colonel Karawanoff,
inspector of the frontier district of Bur

The Government here is taking the
strictest precautions to prevent insurgents
crossing the frontier. One band is re
ported to have been fired on by Bulga

to assist a crowd of fugitives who were
being pursued by the Turks. This inci

Government's correct Intention.

here. The physicians, however, are not
surprised at the large number of cases
to-day, and concur in the opinion that it
may be but the beginning of the end.

doned their sailboat at Asia, a small port
Jn Nejcros off Occidental, and had gone
to Guimbal, on the southeast coast of

MAN1I-A. Oct. 12.â Lieutenant Velas
quez with thirty men of the constabulary
were attacked recently by 500 head hunt
ers of Nueva Viscaya and lost two men,
after killing fifty-three and wounding a
large number of the head hunters. The
enemy were armed with rifles and bolos.

years' imprisonment by Judge Sweeny.
These men were captured in Bulucan and

the statement made to the pblice by their

naping the pretty young wife of a resident
Japanese. It is claimed by the 1 frightened
persons from the land of the Mikado that

nese-Japanese war and who was until re
cently in the employ of the family of the

were married here last Friday by Judge
Cone, and Saturday while he was at
work, he says, she left with two men.
Whether they forced her Â¦ to leave or
whether she left of her own accord he fa
unable to say. He was referred to an at

Two lovers with but a single girl made
rather a queer complication at the mar
riage license counter 'to-day, when Doth
secured a license to marry the object of
their affections. One is spending the
night in jail, while the other is on his
honeymoon.
According to Joseph Ferro, guardian of
Nora Duvall that was, Arthur Rei3 and
Joseph J. Gomez have been paying atten
tions to- his ward, with marriage as their
object. Rels was first on the field, but
left to go to Sacramento, and had been
away for some time when Gomez began
his suit. In a short time he succeeded in
gaining her promise of her heart and
band. But he had a brother who was
making objections . to the marriage, and
Rels, having learned of the state of af
fairs, came back and renewed his atten
tions'. Their marriage was agreed upon,
but news reached Gomez, and both men
appeared for licenses to-day.
When the girl was confronted with both
lovers, each armed with the necessary
papers, she decided to again change her
mind and chose Gomez. Reis took tho
matter Â»o to heart that he began to for
get his grief with long and deep pptations,
and falling into the arms of an unsym
pathetic policeman was taken to Jail.
Gomez and Miss Duvall were married and
are now on their honeymoon trlp^

THREATS MAKE
BOY A BANDIT
San Iuanci.sco has recently voted bonds In
the sum of ? 17,000.000 for Improvements. It
is now a rjuestion as to who is the moat ca
pable man to act as guardian of this vast
sum and to h3\e it Judiciously expended. We
art- situated afar from the scene of battle
and therefore can look upon the contest in an
Impartial and conservative manner. While
we have nothing to say against Lane or
bchmitz nHinR the bill under ordinary cir
cumstances, still we cannot view the election
of either for the best Interests of that city,
and if the voters choose to elect either they
will find out to their sorrow that they have
made a gn-at mistake, for they are not equal
to the occasion. Then we turn to the Re
publican oandidate. Henry J. Crocker. Is he
capable of filling the position satisfactorily?
la he honest? Is he a thorough business man?
Each of these questions can be answered In a
most emphatic manner In the affirmative â he
is. He possesses every qualification to bring
San Francisco up to a standard that will
compare favorably with any municipality In
the United States. Although a wealthy man.
tho sympathies of Mr. Crocker have always
been with tho toilers and all his acts In life
have been above reproach.
Mr. Crocker Is a man of large business ac
quaintance and of large business transactions;
he has managed successfully a large estate,
and Is an active executive officer of more
than one large business corporation. He is a
believer in the rights of labor and by his ac
tions In the conduct of his own affairs and
the affairs of the corporation under his con
trol he has made every employe from the high
est to the lowest an ardent and warm sup
porter of his candidacy. His conservatism and
success In financial circles have won him the
confidence of the capitalists of the city, and
his unostentatious giving to worthy charities
has endeared him to the poor. His training
in all the schools of life has equipped him to
fill the position in which the thinking people
of California's metropolis have asked him to
serve them. With the cautious labor vote
with him. with the thinking business man and
merchant on his side, the possibilities of the
election of any other candidate will dwindle
as the campaign progresses.
In fact, the energies and winning person
ality of Henry J. Crocker count In favor of
the whole ticket. In many respects he is an
Ideal candidate. There Is nothing haughty
and aristocratic In his demeanor. He Is sim
ply a plain, approachable buslneHs man, who
has the rare ability and the Inclination to
serve the people of the city In which he
dwells. When he addresses an audience of his
fellow workers In the cause of San Fran
cisco he does not puff on airs of condescension
and point to himself as the "great I am." He
Is Just the plain, everyday business man and
native son. Henry J. Crocker. His friends,
and they are legion, know that he is not a
professional politician or a chronic Job chaser.
He Is neither dummy nor tool; he Is In the pe
culiarly fortunate position of being a candi
date beyond reproach, representing both the
classes and the masses, whose experience and
sagacity compel confidence alike from Demo
crats and Republicans.
If the people of San Francisco desire a man
of undoubted probity, a man who Is conserva
tive In all matters whose administration would
reflect credit upon himself and the people
whom he represents, they will act wisely If
they go to the polls and ptamp an "X" oppo
site the name of Henry J. Crocker for Mayor.
Commendation for Henry J. Crocker,
Republican Candidate for Mayor.
The Nevada City Daily Transcript re
views the qualifications of the three can
didates for Mayor of San Francisco and
thus pronounces in favor of Henry J.
Crocker. It says:
The contest for llayor of San Francisco is
pttlns to be very exciting. The election Is
to take place very soon and there are three,
prominent men as candidates who are as-
Plrants for the honorâ Henry J. Crocker the
Republican nominee; Eugene E. Schmitz the

The Republican campaign committee
announces that the district meetings to
be held this week under the auspices of
the organization will be addressed by
Duncan E. McKinlay, Jud. C. Brusle,
Daniel A. Ryan, J. T. Nourse, A. Van
der Nalllen, A. P. Van Duser, Frank J.
Murphy, Andrew Branch. Carey Van
Fleet and others. Henry J. Crocker, the
Republican standard-bearer, will speak
to the voters in every district.
Louis S. Beedy, chairman of the Forty
first Assembly District Republican Club,
and H. O. Beatty, member of the execu
tive committee, called at Henry* J.
Crocker's headquarters, 224 Kearny street,
last evening and completed arrangements
for the Republican ratification meeting
at Steimke Hall next Friday evening.
A meeting of the executive committee
of the German - American Republican
Club was held last night at
Golden West Hotel. Colonel Rob
ert Wieneke presided and Carl \V.
Mueller acted as secretary. The mem
bers of the committee, which is com
posed of many of the most prominent
citizens, were all In favor of an ener
getic participation in the present cam
paign.
General Edward S. Salomon, who, with
C. B. Rode, Dr. Brune and a few
others, organized this club twenty-five
years .ago, was present, and all agreed
to make most extraordinary efforts In
behalf of Henry J. Crocker for Mayor,
General Salomon for District Attorney
and the entire Republican ticket.
After discussion, It was resolved to
hold, at an early date, the annual meet
ing of all the club members for the pur
pose of electing officers of the club, at
which time final preparations for a big
mass meeting, to be held at an early date,
will be made.
FOLLOWING VjANISHE'S.
Schmitz did have a small group of Re
publican sympathizers in the Forty-first,
but after Ruef openly declared himself
for Schmitz the following vanished. The
Republicans of the Forty-first have not
the slightest use for political grafters of
the Ruef species. The cry of "Save the
charter!" once fooled many Republicans
of the Forty-first and caused them to
vote for Phelan. Gavin McNab fancies
that the voters can be deceived again by
the same cry, but the election returns will
change his mind. The meeting next Fri
day night will be held in Steimke Hall on
Octavia street, near Union.
Next Saturday evening the Republicans
of the Thirty-third Assembly District will
meet and cheer the nominees of the ticket
at Silk's Hall, corner of Precita avenue
and Mission street.
The committee on vacancies will meet
at 16 Geary street this evening. There is
only one vacancy on the Republican
ticket and that was caused by Charles S.
Laumeister's action in declining to accept
the nomination for Assessor. He was per
suaded by his business associates to keep
out of politics for a few years at least.
There are* several vacancies on the
Union Labor ticket. Gavin McNab Is hav
ing a hard time in filling the vacancies
on the Democratic ticket.
REPUBLICAN MEETINGS.
Several Important meetings will take
place next Thursday evening. Voters of
the Thirty-fourth Assembly District will
assemble at Twin Peaks Hall, corner of
Seventeenth and Noe streets, to hear the
talk concerning new and greater San
Francisco. In the Thirtr-slxth Assem
bly District a big campaign meeting will
be held under Republican auspices at
Harmony Hall, on Mission street, between
Thirteenth and Fourteenth. Republicans
and other energetic citizens of the Thirty
eighth Assembly District will rally at
Mascot Hall, on Golden Gate avenue and
Buchanan street, next Thursday evening.
Friday night, in Henry Crocker's home
district, the Forty-first, there will be a
grand rally of his friends and neighbors.
The meeting will surely be large and en
thusiastic. All the Republican factions of
this important Republican district have
united and buried the hatchet. The
hatchet is burled so deep that not even
the hamlle is sticking out.
SUPPORT ALONG THE FRONT.
Along tho water front he is popular.
Young men fancy him on account of his
progressive, go ahead traits. Republicans
who are familiar with the political senti
ment along the front predict a rousing
vote for Crock'er.
The Republicans of the Twenty-eighth
and Twenty-ninth Assembly districts will
rally to-morrow night at Occidental Hall,
24Â£ Third street. Eloquent and persuasive
speakers will address the people.

hustler 'for votes. His wide range
of personal acquaintance counts largely
in his favor. In this respect he has a
decided advantage over Schmitz and Lane.
Crocker is not airy or conceited. While
he is affable, enterprising and self-re
liant, he Is not quite as versatile as
Schmitz nor as self-important as Lane.
Plain, straightforward business men and
worklngmen take a fancy to men of the
Crocker stamp. They come forward
frankly and give him pledges of support.
â¢The politicians in the Republican party
do not entertain the slightest doubt of
Crocker's election to the office of Mayor,
but they advise strongly against cessa
tion of work. The members of the Re
publican campaign committee are devis
ing plans for a vigorous and effective
canvass of the city. The preliminary
work Is very nearly completed. Several
important district meetings for the pres
ent week are announced.

SAN JOSE. Oct. 10.â The city of San
Jose must pay the John Stock Sons $800
for a lot of fire hose which the city has
been using since March, 1902. The hose
in question is 1000 feet of two and a half
inch material, and was furnished the city
at a time when it was without funds. An
agreement was made by the Board of Po
lice and Fire Commissioners, who ordered
the hose, that It would be paid for on and
after the following July. There was a
change in the x:ity administration in the
meantime, and the incoming board re
jected the bill.
The present commission claimed that it
could not legally pay the claim, as the
f ijnds of one quarter could not be used for
a past quarter.
Judge Leib, after hearing testimony to
day, gave judgment for the full JSOO to
the Stock Sons. He held that, as the
city had taken the hose without a con
tract, had used it and refused or neglect
ed to return it, the city was liable for its
value, just as a private person would be
liable for the conversion of another's
property to' his own use.
Accused of Trunk Thefts.
UKIAH. Oct. 12.â James B. Ward was
arrested at Wlllets to-day, brought to this

the Mark West Springs Hotel when It
was closed for the season. Several
trunks were then found to have been
broken open, and some valuable Jewelry
was missing. Ward is an old soldier, and
recently spent several days In Ukiah, rep
resenting himself as a secret service

zler.

MODESTO, Oct. 12.â Black Harry Carl
gher, who for over twenty years lived
the live of a recluse in a cabin between
Grayson and the Coast Range mountains,
committed suicide either Saturday night
or Sunday by taking strychnine. He had
been on a debauch for some time. Melan

SAUSALITO, Oct. 12,â They were
chums at school during childhood, for the
last ten years they were sweethearts and
lately were participants in a double mar
riage without .the knowledge of their
closest friends. This conveys some Idea
of the romantic marital affair of Mis3
Marion Harrison and Richard Sperry.
Not until to-day did the society folk of
Sausalito become aware that Miss Har
rison was married. Mrs. Sparry, mother
of Richard, was made cognizant of tho
fact several months ago, just prior to her
departure for the East. Miss Harrison
accompanied Mrs. Sperry on her .Eastern
trip, but up to that time her mother waa
not aware that she was Sirs. Sperry's
daughter-in-law. In fact not unxli after
a child was born and after MY*. Spertr^'a
return to Sausalito withoirt thfe your.jj
mother did the Harrisons learn that their
daughter was married.
The announcement at that time was aa
great a surprise to the Harrisons as it
was to Sausalito when made public to
day. Sperry and Miss Harrison grew up
together and were always chums. In
later years their fondness fcr each othpr
was apparent. Mr. and Mrs. Harrison
were particularly opposed to a match and
did everything to break off the affair.
When Mrs. Sperry proposed Uoing East
and taking Miss Harrison with her it was
supposed this was soon to cause an
estrangement between the young couple.
As a matter of fact, however, the two hud
been married several months prior to that
time.
Just before leaving the elder Mrs.
Sperry was told of the union. She soon
became reconciled, but knowing her son
to be under age doubted the validity of
the marriage and insisted upon another
ceremony. Accordingly Mr. Sperry ac
companied his mother and wife as far aa
Sacramento. A minister was in waiting
and the second marriage was performed
in the railroad car at midnight upon the
arrival of the overland train. The two
ladles proceeded East, while the groom
returned to Sausalito.
Mrs. Sperry and the bride Journeyed
through Canada and Eastern cities for
some time. On September IS a daughter
was born. Soon after that Mrs. Sperry
Sr. started West, leaving the young
mother in Baltimore. On her arrival hero
Mrs. Harrison was informed and she will
start East to-morrow night to join her
daughter.
Richard Sp#rry is the son of Mrs. C. E.
Sperry and the late James W. Sperry ot
the Sperry Flour Company. He is also u
near relative of the W. H. Crockers. Miss
Harrison is the daughter of J. H. Harri
son, the San Francisco coal broker. Mrs.
Sperry is a very beautiful girl of eighteen
years.

"As for the gentleman rrom Canada, if
he was a friend of the workinsman he
would be on this platform to-night trying
to get you to vote for this ticket in

talking for the opposition.''
William G. Burke, candidate for City
Attorney, announced in his speech that
the leader of Democracy, meaning Gavin
McNab, had tried to get him to withdraw

Union Labor ticket. Burke further said
that scores of Democrats had visited his
office trying to get him to resign, but he
would stand by the cause of labor. "I
have been offered places of lanre profit,"
he said, "with the further inducement
that I could practice my profession as
long as the Democracy was In power. I
told them that my honor was priceless
and told them to take back to their leader
the answer I gave them and that was 'I
stand for the organized labor of San
Francisco, for human liDerty and for

Mayor Schmitz, in the course of his
speech, took occasion to cliar?e the Bul
letin with deliberate lying. He said the
Bulletin in its columns state.l that he
had twenty newsboys arrested last week
because they misbehaved themrelves. In
answer to this he said:
Only last evening in the Bulletin there ap
peared an article that I had twenty newsboys
arrested because the little boys marched out
Market street to Fillmore to Bush. In order to
show their appreciation for me. I love the

VETERAN SHOWMAN DIES
AFTER MUCH SUFFERING
Colonel Boone, Confederate Soldier
and Famous Animal Trainer,
Joins Big Majority. '
Colonel E. Daniel Boone, Confederate
veteran, showman, and for the past two
years in charge of the Zoo at the Chutes,

In the revelations which have followed the gigantic
smash of the shipbuilding trust one fact asserts itself
pre-eminently. The organizers of the concern left
nbsolutely nothing undone to justify us in calling
them thieves of monumental assurance and manipu
lators princely in their conception of their chosen pro
fession.
Several of the Servian officers who conspired
against the murderers of King Alexander and Queen
Draga have been sent to prison for their bold pro
test against the policy of assassination. And still
Servia asks the world to accept it as a civilized,
Christian nation. It must exhibit something more
than the ethics of an Apache to be included within
the pale.,
The glint of British muskets was seen not long
since in Boston streets, but it was the glint of
friendly muskets upheld to the sun by the arms of
men who had crossed the seas to extend greetings of
comradeship and good will. Time works changes in
nations no less than in individuals, and the soldiers
of two nations who met then in fraternity cared little
what their great-grandfathers had done in the days of
strife gone by.
A MUNICIPAL campaign must in the very na
ture of things be nearly always a campaign
of personalities, since the personal qualifica
tions of the various candidates for the performance
cf the tutics of the offices to which they aspire arc
matters of serious concern, not to taxpayers only, nor
even to voters only, but to the whole community. In
weighing the merits of the rival aspirants for any of
nce it is never necessary to cast unjust aspersions
upon one for the purpose of advocating another, if
that ether have in himself any fitness for the place
and any worth that is deserving of honor. It is for
that reascr. that in this campaign the. Republican
press and Republican orators have had no unfair
word to say against their opponents. They have
tound iurncient argument in presenting to the people
the urgent ueedof a business administration, and the
undoubted qualifications of Henry J. Crocker for per
forming with genuine efficiency all the duties of the
Mayor's office.
The issue in that respect was clearly stated by
Samuel M. Shortridge in his letter read at the grand
ratification meeting on Saturday evening, in the
course of which he said: "I would attack no man's
character, I would impugn no man's motives; I would'
simply apply the Jeff ersonian test â integrity, capac
ity, fitness. Measuring candidates by that standard,
it will appear upon dispassionate reflection that the
city's great interests will be best guarded and ad
vanced by the election of Mr. Crocker. Friend of
all legitimate business enterprises and enemy of none,
looking toward the' steady and profitable employment

INTEGRITY, CAPACITY, FITNESS.
On a ranch near Pleasanton a few days ago two
Indian women fought a duel with knives. " The sub
ject of the discussion was a Mexican and the object
the possession of his affections. One of the ladies
is now .largely mince-meat and the other is in jail,
but both are probably happy in the reflection that
they so gallantly have made their sacrificial offering
to the god of love.
The trial of George Beavers, many times and va
riously indicted for alleged crimes against the national

need he may take one consolation to himself. If he
were convicted and sentenced on every charge

ering the life spans of half a dozen ordinary men,
would be unusual, unnatural and contrary to the prac
tice of a civilized nation.
Optimists still find hope for the Panama canal be
cause the lower house of the Colombian Congress
has not yet had an opportunity to vote upon the pro

increased circulation of cash among legislators of the
United States of Colombia.
At a recent Women's Congress., representative of

permitted the balance of opinion in a debate to de

question was not put to a vote. The fair debaters
preferred to reserve the privilege of revising their

PERSONAL MENTION.
The people have voted ample means to their gov
ernment, to be spent in accentuating the natural
charms of our location and in providing for the
health and happiness of our rapidly increasing popu
lation. The Republican party should take pride in
accepting and faithfully discharging a trust so im
portant. The ratification meeting indicates that it
feels its capacity and is confident of its power and
purpose. This feeling attracts to it the independent
vote of the city, and wins also many of the opposi
tion, who are tired of taking promises from their
leaders which are never kept.
THE great meeting on Saturday night to ratify
the Republican city ticket was significant of the
rousing of a proper civic spirit in the party.
Had the occasion been the ratification of a national
ticket, it could hardly have been more noticeable for
the greatness of its enthusiasm and the greatness of
the speeches, which uttered the purpose of the party
to assume the great trust of government.
For many years the city has been governed by
the opposition. It has reached power by making
many promises. How few of these have been ful
filled is shown by the interesting fact that two anti-
Republican candidates are now in the field, each
asking to be elected Mayor in order that he may
redeem pledges that were made seven years ago, but
still remain dishonored. In that time the city has
progressed greatly. Its advance has been pushed by
the private prosperity that in those years has come
to the whole country, and of which an abundant
share has fallen to San Francisco. That prosperity
began when the rational administration became Re
publican, and has increased year by year with the
party in continued power.
What change has come upon the face of the city
<lue to public administration has been pioneered and
forced by civic organizations, that reflect the general
prosperity. But little, indeed, has originated with
the city government, or in the efforts of those who
h&ve controlled it. Mr. Lane admits that the city is
Republican, so that there can be no doubt that the
party of the majority may take the government if it
will. In a high sense this admission puts the Re
publican party onÂ»trial. If it conclude itself fit to
govern San Francisco, it will do so. If it conclude
that another party may govern the city, it will per
mit it by voting another ticket or by not voting at
all.
It is seldom that an issue with cleaner edge is
presented to a party. The governing of the city is a
public duty. It should not be sought for the emolu
ments it carries, nor for pride of place and position.
The only justifiable motive for seeking it is to use
it well, in the interest of all the people.
We have had a long siege of opposition govern
ment, which has been impeached by those responsi
ble for it. The Republican party can surely do no
worse than it is charged the opposition has done.
It can so easily do better that every Republican
voter should have the pride to want to try. The next
two years will be important years in the history of
this city, and it is no campaign talk to say that upon
the character of the local government for that time
will depend important things in all the future of San
Francisco.
THE GREAT RATIFICATION
As a priest his early work was in the
territory along the Potomac River. In
May, 1S75, he was consecrated Bishop of
Wheeling. He ruled that diocese until
June 13, 1S03, when he was appointed co
adjutor to the Most Rev. Richard Peter
Kenlck of St. Louis. Upon the death of
that prelate he succeeded to the archbish
opric of St. Louis, on May 21, 1S35.
Sanitarium, where he has been a
patient for several weeks, the physicians
report that there are no hopes for his re
covery and that It Is evident he is suffer
ing no pain.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 12.â Because of the se
rious illness of Archbishop Kain he was
relieved of the active work of this arch
diocese several months ago by Bishop
Glennon of Kansas City, who was ap
pointed coadjutor.
Archbishop Kain is one of the most
widely known and most popular prelates
in the United States. Born In Martins
burg, Berkeley County, West Virginia,
on May 31, 1841, of Irish parentage, he re
ceived in early life the training which
made his work in the church such that
he forged to the front quickly. His pre
paratory education for the priesthood was
received in St. Charles Seminary, Ellicott,
Md., where he was graduated In 1S62. Hs
then entered St. Mary's College, at Bal
timore, which institution was the scene of
his higher studies. He was ordained a
priest by Archbishop Spaulding on July
2, 1868.
ALTIMORE, Oct. 12.â The condi
tion of Archbishop Kain Is still
unchanged. He became uncon-
scious yesterday. At St. Agnes
The chief feature of the grand reception was a ban
quet given in Symphony Hall, at which about 900
people sat down. Over that banquet the Boston
papers began raving for some days before it took
place, and it is probable they will never quit. It ap
pears the banquets of Lucullus were but side-table
lunches when compared to this great Symphonic
feast. The Boston Globe gives the figures thus:
Total cost of the banquet, $60,000; cost of serving
each individual, $75; time spent in preparing for it.
twelve months; time spent in arranging the light ef
fects, thirty days; miles .of wire used in lighting, 450;
number of people employed in serving the dinner,
Soo; number of waiters, 300; gallons of wine served,
400; number of cigars served in ?silver cases, 2500;
value of cigars, $800; number of electric glo"bes used
in decoration, 15.000.
What, more could anybody ask. New York and
Wall street may smash and Chicago may lose herself
in the mud of Cook County, but Boston will flourish
like eternal light, extending to every Honourable of
any part of the globe a perpetual welcome to halls
of Symphony, to floods of wine and feasts of electric
lights â for so far as we can learn from our Boston
exchanges there was no food on tit* tables, at least
there is no statement of the cost of it.
WHILE Chicago has been celebrating a cen
tennial of progress and of boom, while New.
York has been watching the various flur
ries in Wall street and giving amazed attention to
the disclosures concerning the inner workings of the
shipbuilding trust, Boston has been enjoying the
quiet and unostentatious way in which her Ancient
and Honorable Artillery Company has entertained
the Honourable Artillery Company of London. The
entertainment was strictly Bostonian, and very ex
clusive. The people of the neighboring cities were
invited to do no more than take notice of the ex
quisite courtesy shown by Boston in spelling the
title of their own artillery in the American fashion,
while carefully remembering on every occasion to
spell the title of the London company after the
British fashion â "Honourable."
The occasion was a glad one in Boston for many
reasons. Inthe first place, Chicago in her centennial
celebration ventured to get a number of boomers to
undertake an automobile ride of 150 miles round
about Chicago, the object being to show what a
matchless system of boulevards she has, or will have
when she gets them fixed up. The reports that went
back to Boston of the results of the Chicago ven
ture filled the Bostonian mind with a pleasure that
almost reached the point of glee; and one of the
leading papers of the city said of the adventurers:
"They had various experiences before they got back,
but the beauties of what they describe are quite won
derful. Chicago's ambition is very laudable, but be
fore her guests get stuck too deeply again in the
quagmires of Cook County, it might be well for her
to send a commission over to Boston to see what
this city has done in the line of establishing a metro
politan park system."
Feeling good over the superiority of her parks and
drives when compared with those of which Chicago
has boasted so much, Boston felt better still when
she compared her easy and secure wealth with the
bull-tossed and bear-squeezed so-called "securities"
of New York; therefore she resolved to make her re
ception of the Honourables of London an occasion
for showing the world that she has more money than
beans, and a capacity for spending it that is virtually
without a limit.
BOSTON'S BIG TIME
Report has it that King Peter of Servia has been
imprisoned in a Belgrade fortress by the assassins of
Alexander and Draga and is being forced to submit
affairs of state to their murderous dictation. King
Peter is evidently learning the bitter lesson that by
their deeds we know men and out of murder no good
can come.

"The language attributed to him is very
improbable and until I hear to ti con
trary and have some other guarantee for
believing that Mr. Aylesworth has so ex
pressed himself I shall believe that this
interview, like many others, was not an
expression of the views of Mr. Ayles
worth."
Sir Wilfrid Laurier replied that the
Government had taken no steps to ascer
tain whether the alleged interview had
taken place or not. He added:
"We assume that this interview had
not the character attributed to it. Mr.
Aylesworth is a counsel of very great
eminence and I would hesitate to believe,
and I think my honorable friend would
have equal hesitation, that Mr. Ayles
worth would have expressed any opinion
on a matter which is sub judlce and in
which he himself is one of the judges.
"It seems to me rather unusual and I
decline to believe that Mr. Aylesworth
could have used the language attributed
to him."
While nothing can be known definitely,
a very hopeful feeling prevails in Ameri
can circles. A significant reflex of tniÂ»
appears in to-day's Times. .Dealing with
the difficulties encountered in the selec
tion of a new British Embassador to the
United States and the irritation which he
would have to tace both in Canada and
the United States if the tribunal broke
up with a disagreement, the Times says:
"We rejoice to say that there is believed
to be something more than a possibility
that an award may be agreed upon, or
rather that seven questions may be so
answered as to end the matter."
The Commissioners adjourned for the
day without having reached a decision.
John W. Foster and the American
counsel of the Alaskan Boundary Com
mission entertained the arbitration com

OTTAWA, Ont., Oct. 12.â In Parliament
to-day Minister Borden asked if the
Prime Minister had taken any steps to
verify the accuracy of an alleged inter
view with Mr. Aylesworth, one of the
commissioners on the Alaskan boundary
question. Borden said the telegraphic re

with regard to his duties as commissioner

now the subject of political controversy

National Committee, in commenting on the course
of the Hearst papers as inciting to murder, and re
ferring to Hearst personally, said: "So long as men
prominent in public life, or in the walks of business,
or in the spheres of society, are willing to recognize
by social receptions, by newspaper subscriptions, the
influence which we all recognize as at the foundation,
of this sad development of public opinion, so long
as gentlemen in your position shall give your coun
tenance, either by social intercourse or otherwise, to
these enemies of mankind, to these traitors to human
ity, it is idle to deplore events like the murder of
President McKinley."
So, in near fields and far, the Examiner and its
associates have gleaned for a form of attack upon
men, that is peculiar in its chattering malice and its
appeal to violence. In frankness it must be admitted
that much of its grossest conduct in that respect has
been aimed at the men locally or nationally eminent
in its own party. If the best element in Democracy
should get control in localities and in the nation and
nominate a ticket representative of the party's for
mer virtues, it would be hard to find men for can
didates who have not been attacked by the Hearst
newspapers. Therefore the Examiner's resoft to the
' parallel is labor in vain in this community, where
the best men in its own political party know that
if they go before the public as candidates the Exam
iner parallel can be pulled on them.
TO hide its own humiliation and its surrender to
McNab and Lane, the Examiner is engaged in
aiming the deadly parallel at its contempor
aries. In that sort of sport the Examiner has no
monopoly, since no newspaper in the country is more
open to retaliation. All newspapers that have inde
pendent views occasionally find it necessary to criti
cize individuals and to disagree with party action.
When this is caused by a definite and inflexible view
of principle, or is based upon some passing issue that
is for the moment important, the act is justifiable
and needs no apology. But the Examiner's bolts of
its party, and its attacks upon members thereof, have
seldom had any better excuse than personal ma
lignity.
It pursued Stephen M. White with the keenest per
sonal rancor and smote him during the whole of his
illustrious public career. For a long time California
had a solitary Democratic Representative in Con
gress, the Hon. Marion de Vries. The Examiner
blacklisted him and tracked him ceaselessly with
venom and spite and the most pronounced hatred.
Yet he was a gentleman, a party man and an able
representative. When Wiley B. Tinnin, an eminent
Democrat, was serving as Surveyor of the Port, the
Examiner said of him: "It is an established fact
that Tinnin is a thief." Ex-Mayor Phelan is known
to be a backer of Lane. The Examiner hunted
Phelan throughout his last term as Mayor, and hardly
let a day go by without throwing mud at him and
his administration. It pursued School Director
Denman until two of its men got an admonitory
thrashing, and then quit through fear of more pun
ishment. It. attacked Lane before his nomination
for the Governorship and bolted him in the cam
paign.
To extend the history of its party bolts in this
State and of its virulent attacks on party leaders and
nominees would require a newspaper page. In na
tional matters it has pursued the same course. It
brought all of its resources of billingsgate and pub
licity to bear upon President Cleveland during his
last administration, and rotten-egged him into pri
vate life.
As late as March 31, 1898, William Randolph
Hearst said: "And McKinley â bar one girthy Prince
ton person who came to be no more, no less, than
a living breathing crime in breeches â is the most
despised and hated creature in the hemisphere. His
name is hooted, his figure burned in effigy." The
"girthy person" was Mr. Cleveland.
As we have said, in characterizing Hearst's attacks
on President Roosevelt, the abuse of public men by
his papers is intensely personal and has no relation
whatever to proper criticism. That it is an expres
sion of personal hatred merely is proved clearly by
its studied incitement to murderous attack upon its
objects. In one of these attacks upon McKinley
Hearst said: "It is foolish for an anarchist to aim
his blood and thunder at the old-fashioned little
kings and emperors when the real kings are so" near
at home." Thi? was said between the time of the
assassination of the King of Italy and the murder
of McKinley, The King's assassin had been appoint
ed to that duty by the anarchist circle of Paterson,
New Jersey, and had crossed the ocean to commit
the crime.

SAN JUAN, Porto Rico. Oct. 12.âGov

Ponce, where he attended a. banquet in
celebration of the extension of the Amer
ican railway In the Island. During the
Governor's absence the anti-American
Socialists and anarchists had a clash with
the police on the plaza of this city. Forty
arrests were made, and many prisoners
were to-day convicted and sentenced to
six months' Imprisonment, Including the
anarchist Conde. who was recently con
victed of insulting the American flag.
The clash was due to the Socialists,
who attacked the police. The latter or
dered the mob to disperse, and on meet-
Ing with a refusal they used their c.'ubs
freely.
Americans here are particularly in
censed at the carrying of black and red
flags and a craped American flag by a
mob yesterday as an incitement to disor
der. Conde delivered a very offensive
harangue, in which he approved of the
mob resorting to bloodshed if necessary.
The Americana demand the punishment
of all the dangerous Socialists and are
overwhelming Governor Hunt with assur
ances of support in a vigorous campaign
to- uphold law and order. They urged that
an immediate death blow be given to an

And did you ever read of Delaroo? He was an Indian. He was
more. He was the shadow incarnate of Maje Sampson. He was even
more than that, rje was the best railroad character that ever caught
the facile pen of Frank H. Spearman, who is himself the best writer of
American railroad stories in the world to-day. This is Delaroo as
Spearman knew him:
"As long as Maie would talk Delaroo would listen. That single
word was, in fact, the kev to Delaroo^ Delaroo was a listener: for that
reason nobody knew much about him."
And this in brief is one of the most tense moments in all Spear-
man's exciting narrative of Delaroo's career:
"What do I think of it?" muttered^ Neighbor, when the local operator
asked him for a report for Callahan. "I think there's two engines for
the scrap in sight â and the 26a. if we can ever find anything of her â and
about a million sheet) to pav for â " Neighbor paused to give an order
and survey the frightful scene.
"And Delaroo." repeated the operator. "He wants to know about
Delaroo â "
"Missing."
If you have been reading Spearman's new series of two-oage stories
you will not need even these extracts to keep you on a sharp lookout for
Delaroo in the next Sunday Call. Spearman's stories are the sort that
you never forget. They get a grip on your memory like the mysterious
fascination of railroading itself. Â¦,--;

Ambroise Thomas' "Mignon" was given
an artistic interpretation by the Tivoli
grand opera company last night. That
the beautiful lyric opera Is always a fa
\orite with San Franrisco music lovers
was clearly demonstrated by the plaudits
of the audience. The members of the
company to whose tender mercies the
vocal score was consigned were all more
or Ies3 equal to the difficulties which the
pioduction of "Mignon" entails, and bar
ring a slight unacquaintance with the
music in certain unimportant parts inci
dent to a iirst night's production tho
opera was admirably presented.
To Cloe Marchesini was intrusted the
title role, which is as different to the
character of Carmen, in which she has al
ready achieved success, as day is to night.
In Mignon all the pent-up sorrow of a
woman whose love for a. man seems
doomed to disappointment is given its
fullest expression, and to say that Mar
chesini sang and acted the part admirably
Is putting it mildly. Marchesini was, if
anything, too somber in her portrayal of
the love-lorn gypsy girl. Her voice de
pict* a depth of pathos that is realistic
in the extreme, and the tender passages
were given with an intuitive knowledge of
their vocal requirements.
Adelina Tromben's Fellna was the exact
antithesis of Marcheslni's Mignon. Trom
ben was at all times Joyful, and the
rhythmic quality of her voice is admir
ably suited to the Joyous strains -which
Thomas has evolved for the gay actress.
Tromben at all times shows the thorough
cultivation which her voice has under
gone, and especially Is this true of the
"staccato" numbers, In which she Is per

is the village church, with its towering"

:nsr the management of the Southern Cali
fornia State Hoppital for loose business
methods. Governor Pardee finds that the
charges of cruelty to the Insane inmates
brought against the phypicians and at
â¢â¢>ndants at the hospital are not sustained
by the evidence.
In a lengthy letter to the board of man
r.grrs to-day the Governor announced his
conclusions, based on the testimony ad
duced at the recent investigation into the
i.ffairs of the asylum. Governor Pardee

that It is the duty of *-very citizen to
impart at once any knowledge he may

ploye of the State. If any citizen have
Fuch knowlfde? and keeps it secret he
is. in the judgment of the Governor, a
party to the oJTonse and is as guilty as
the offending: official.
The Governor maintains that this prin
ciple applies even more stror.g'.y to an
employe of the Staf. Remarking that
In the present case the charges appear
to have orisinatPd with discharged em
ployes, the Governor says it too often
happens that an accuser makes no sound
until, his conscience suddenly aroused by
his threatened or actual discharge and
the stoppage of his pay. he makes dls
< losures which, it. true, ought to have
been made long before. The charges of
such persons are. in the judgment of the
Governor, entitled to little credence, ex
cept in the faco of corroborative evidence.
The Governor says that the evidence
does nrt Fhow cruelty was practiced upon
the Rev. Dr. Plannette, the mental con
dition of those testifying in this instance
being such as to render their testimony
of little value. He fails to discover proof
of the charge that painful vurprical ope
rations were performed without the ad
ministration of a general anesthetic.
The Governor says there is much evi
dence of loose methods in the conduct of
the business of the Institution. For in

Â£r*cis.l Diypatch to The Call
To generalize, it is fair to say that the
new people justified predictions to a
marked degree. Tho play was emotional.
Thoir work was good, with few excep
tions, from beginning to end. Miss Block
has thtJ gift of Mich mobile features that
she can express much in a look. She has
a line stage presence. Durkin probably
lias roles in which he can make a stronger
showing, but he was generally entirely
equal to the requirements imposed upon
him by his lines and by the situations.
Miss Starr bids fair to win a great name
as an emotional actress. She is pretty
and petite and has an air of spontaneity.
The support was good. The play was well
staged. The calls before the curtain
equaled the Alcazar's best and moÂ« en
thusiastic record.
There were'several scenes in which Miss
Block fairly earned the applause that she
received, which was abundant. She was
suggestive and emotional when she told
Donald of his worthlessness; pathetic
when condoling with the wife of Donald,
in her mean lodging; but the last act was
her best-
In the last act. which is finely staged,

Sir Richard generously declares that there
will be no wedding that day. He recog
nizes that the love of Donald and Lady
Bountiful is still strong and he will not
stand in their way.
Of course Lady Bountiful appears on
the stage at this interesting juncture.
Bhe has some lines here that were so full
of probability that they were very re
freshing. The sick wife confesses that
she has learned of the love that Donald
and Lady Bountiful entertained and that
the has been jealous, but that all that is
irone by. She also writes a letter to be
delivered to Donald by Lady Bountiful in
the event that she, the wife, should fail
to get well. Then there is an affecting
scene with the baby. Finally Lady Boun
tiful, putting around the neck of the baby
a chain with locket as a keepsake, goes
away, escorted by Sir Richard Philhter
(Kred J. Butler). whom she has now prom
ised to marry. This scene was managed
very nicely by Miss Block.
The culmination of this act is the death
of Donald's wife. Margaret. They were
to go across the sea to America to find
a fortune. Donald is bidden by his wife
to sit down and talk wltn the baby where
she can see him. This he is doing, tell
ing of the glowing future for them when
the wife, without warning and without
sound, dies suddenly. If Frances Starr
should never appear on the stage again
at the Alcazar, that scene would be suf
ficient to preserve her memory, for some
time there.
Then Donald and his bride are in a
cheap lodging in London and with them
the parents of the bride, the bankruptcy
of the Veales having brought about the
pinch of poverty. There is a baby In a
cradle, a sick wife, whose "coming down
stairs" after an il!ne?s of many weeks is
the motive- for a large part of one act.
Herein there are opportunities for excel
lent business and very ttw chances were
neglected in making this effective. There
are the favorite flowers of the sick wife
that are bought, out of scanty money and
all the touches that true affection could
suggest, in sharp contrast with the otter
geltishness of the father, which role, by
the way, was very cieverly done by
Mahcr.
"Lady Bountiful" has a story that runs
about like this. Lady P.uuntiful is pos
sessed of large wealth and a large heart.
Wifh these two advantages she Is in a
fair way to justify her name and this she
is discovered to b<* doing in the first act.
She is supporting a worthless uncle,
Roderick Hrron. who was impersonated
by John B. Maher, and also a cousin,
Donald Heron, represented in the flesh by
Jamf? Durkin. There is an aunt to Lady
Bountiful, who is disgusted with the
spectacle of the younger Heron idle and
the oldfr Heron complacently sponging on
hia niece and she causes disclosures to be
made.
As a result Donald Heron, after a scene
in which Lady Bountiful tells him plainly
that she has contempt for his uselessness,
goes out to earn an honest living. He
finds his way to the family !ind stable of
John Vcale (George Osbourne). There
Donald's father follows him and, for his
own selfish ends, gossips in such manner
as to bring about the unexpected 1 sequence
of the announcement of a matrimonial
engagement between Donald and the
daughter of Yeale. Miss Starr appears
as Margaret, the daughtf r. The announce
ment of this engagement take? place in
the presence of Lady Bountiful and her
friends. She is so much in love with
Donald that she faints when she is trying
to extend congratulations.
A play n*w to San Francisco, by Pinero,
and three new people served to focus the
dramatic interest of the first nighters
largely on the Alcazar 'ast evening. The
play was "Lady Bountiful." The new
people were James Durkln. leading iran;
Adele Block, with a New York reputation
to justify, and Franres Starr, a new In
genue. Witn thâ¬se peopl* and the others
in the cast the combination was the
strongest that has been seen in the Al
cazar for many a moon and possibly the
best ever in that house.
A Southern belle who Is attracting
much attention in the city is Miss Edith
Terry of Louisville, Ky., who is a guest
at the Occidental, chaperoned by Mrs.
West Hughes. Both ladles came to San
Francisco to attend the functions inci
dental to the Confederate convention.
Miss Terry is a splendid type of Titian
beauty, with all the verve that accom
panies that type. She has been hospi
tably entertained during her stay in this
city, and if she decides to remain through
the winter will probably hold a little
court all her own.
Mrs. Edward Deering issued cards to
forty ladies for Friday, the 9th inst., to
meet Mrs. Eugene Grace, the president
of the California Women's Whist League,
of which Mrs. Deering Is secretary. The
guest of honor has just returned from
an extended Eastern trip, and the ladles
present will profuse in their welcomes to
her. Euchre was played, and a jolly
party of ladies eagerly contested for a
number of handsome prizes, which were
won by the following named: Mrs. T. J.
Weldon first. Mrs. S. Braverman second,
Mrs. H. Cline booby, Mrs. R. E. Miller
consolation prize.
Mr. and Mrs. David Hirshler have Is
sued invitations for a muslcale on Wed
nesday next.
Mrs. Joseph Spear, wife of the Surveyor
of the Port, entertained a few friends at
luncheon yesterday.

The wedding of Miss Eleanor Glynn,
niece of Judge R. J. Tobin and Captain
John Mooney, will take place at high
noon Wednesday, the 21st, at St. Mary's
Cathedral. The Rev. Father Prender
gast, vicar'general, will perform the cere
mony, at which Dr. Pawlicki and Miss
Glynn will assist. The fair bride-to-be
will be given into the keeping of the
groom by her uncle, Judge Tobin, with
whom she has always made her home.
The trousseau of the bride Is said to be
rarely beautiful, her wedding gown being
a robe of exquisite Irish point. The
couple will reside at the Hotel Majestic
after their wedding trip.
The engagement of Miss Sadie Eliza
beth Rattigan to Paul Jerome Regan, son
of Mr. P. J. Regan, has been announced.
The bride-to-be is the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. J. Rattigan, and is a girl of
splendid physique and fine personality.
She was graduated from the Ursuline
Convent in Santa Rosa and has devoted
much time to music. The young people
will be married within a few months.
On last Saturday night Mr. and Mrs.
L,. J. Hanchett celebrated then- golden
wedding by giving a dinner at the home of
their son, Louis Edward Hanchett, 1911
Broderlck street.
The decorations were in tones of yel
low, fitly commemorative of the hour.
Telegrams were received during the day
ant} evening from scores of friends from
afar, and the gift of a beautiful ringâ an
ornament of rare workmanshipâ was re
ceived from Mrs. George Crocker, the
daughter, now in New York.
And still charity in the pleasant guise
of pleasure holds forth its beckoning hand
to us. This time it is the "household
shower" of . the splendid, plucky little
Alden Club i of the International Sun
shine Society. Now, there are scoffers
who laugh at the Sunshine Society and
call It sentimental and maudlin and other
unpleasant names, but if they could be
hold.'the lifting of heavy burdens by this
same little society they would become
wiser and better men. The tender solici
tude of this little band of maids for the
afflicted is manifested dally in hospitals
and In the homes of sorrow. Now they
ask for help and this is the manner of
the asking: A "household shower" is to
be held at the Sorosis Club on Saturday
afternoon. October 17, from 2 o'clock un
til 6. Everything in the line of household
goods will be on sale â at moderate prices,
and your change back! Such an oppor
tunity for the many couples threatening
matrimony, and for such an excellent
cause, too.
The arrangements for the Confederate
Daughters' ball on the 23d lnst. at the
Palace are going merrily on. The func
tion la distinguished by two features that
augur well for its successâ it formally in
augurates the winter season of gayety and
at the same time has for its object the
caring for the men who wore the gray.
As to the first feature the debutantes, the
belles and the dowagers are holding long
and solemn conclaves with thoughtful
gov/nmakers and it is a safe assumption
that stunning trappings will be evolved.
And where could a fellow expect to find
a gayer galaxy of beauty than among
the women of the sunny South? It is
whispered that the buds are expectant of
radiantly merry hours, and the belles â
well, Southern belles with their beauty
and buoyancy are ever merryâ likewise
those about them. . Then the inspiration
of giving a tithe to the gallant old men
who need It Is sufficient to breathe vital
ity into the stupidest kind of a .function.
So with this dual feature of pleasure
and charity the success of the Con
federacy ball is assured, and that there
will be hospital bedsâ and those a-plentyâ
for the poor old stranded veterans after
the proceeds of the ball' are garnered in
is no longer a matter of doubt. The fol
lowing ladies are lending their best ener
gies to making the affair the success it
promises: Mrs. Arthur W. Foster, Mrs.
William M. Gwin, Mrs. William F. Her
rln, Mrs. William B. Collier, Mrs. Selden
S. Wright, Mrs. Phoebe Hearst. Mrs.
Alfred Hunter Voorhies, Mrs. Wakefleld
Baker, Mrs. John Garber, Mrs. Eleanor
Martin. Mrs. Ynez Shorb* White, Mrs.
William L.. Dun! and Mrs. William B.

BANK EMBEZZLEMENT CASE
MAY FALL TO THE GROUND
Federal Court Rules Adversely to
Indictment Filed Against a
Former Judge.
LEAVENWORTH, Kans., Oct 12.â
Judge John F. Phillips in the United
States Circuit Court here to-day rendered
a decision holding In effect that none of
the nineteen counts in the first Indict
ment against former Judge William Mar
tindale, who was indicted by the Federal
Grand Jury on the alleged charge of mis
appropriating the funds of the defunct
First National Bank of Emporia, are
good. There is still another indictment
against Martindale in connection with the
handling of funds in several small bank
feeders to the First National Bank, of
Emporia.
The indictments against Judge Martin
dale, who was vice president of the con
cern, grew out of the failure of the First
National Bank in 189S, when President
Charles Cross, a noted cattle breeder,
committed suicide . after an investigation
that disclosed the fact that he had lost
the bank's money; in speculation. Al
though , Cross â¢ left a confession exonerat
ing Martindale the latter was indicted.

lieves She Was the Victim of

ble of Eldora, la., has been in Brooklyn

merchant of Brooklyn. She died Febru

ber of the Epworth Metnodist Church,

This list will be submitted to Stanford
before Satufday t as required by agree
ment. It ?s rumored on the California
campus that Stanford will protest at least
three menâ Captain Overall, Heltmuller
iind Forse, all of whom are accused of
playing professional baseball. But as each
of these men denies having played pro
fessional baseball, and the protest is so
far only a myth, there is nothing to do
but watt until Stanford peruses the list
and does something.
The training table for the varsity team
was established to-day at the Dining As
sociation. The following fifteen men were
selected by Coach Whipple for the first
assignment to the table: Captain Overall,
Stroud, Stow, Howard, Heltmuller,
Hudson, Demeritt. Whipple, Mini, More,
Rlsley, Muther, Belknap and Forse. This
number will be increased as the season
grows older.
California and Stanford will not trade
campuses this week as intended. Reliance
and California will meet Wednesday on
the Berkeley campus instead of at Stan
ford and the Fort Baker soldiers and
Stanford will play at Stanford instead of
at IJerkelev.
The freshmen will play against Belmont
to-morrow afternoon on the Berkeley
campus.. As Belmont always gathers a
good team together the contest is likely:
to be the most stubborn of the season.

BRIGHTON* BEACH, Oct. 12.â The en
tire infleld was filled with water from one

eandy soil of the track itself was bo sat
urated that Its cplor was a dark brown,
almost like chocolate. Near the rail it
was very sticky, and any horse forced to
run In that part of the track was reason
ably sure to be beaten.
Whether Astarita would have won th?
Ripple handicap if either Young Henry or
Ahumada had l>eÂ«n more fortunate at the
start is much to be doubted. Ahumada
ran a remarkably good race after being
practically left at the pest. The colt" was
never better in his life, and though he
FT'Owc-d much temper on his way to the
Ftarting post it seemed vrry hard that he
should receive such a bad start that the
whole aspect of the race was altered.

Special r>iEpatch to The Call
Willie See finally put one over in the !
six furlongs run, following. He handled !
the 4 to 1 chance, Marelio, with good '
Judgment, beating out the 8 to 5 favorite,
The Miller, by a neck. As everything in
the race was 4 or 5 to 1, it was difficult to
single out a second or third choice. i
Even money and take your pick,
Searcher or Cambaceres, 5 to 1 llomage
and 6 to 1 Invictus, the ticket showed on
the four starters in the mile and a six
teenth selection. Searcher was strung up
to do all sorts of things, but Powell on
Cambaceres led the good thing a dog's
life from the Jump, winning under half
pressure in 1:48. Homage showed.
Unquestionably the pyrotechnical win of
the fifth stanza, a 5^ scramble, by Estado
was one of the features. The gelding was
stanchly supported at 5 to 2, and beat
the other starters away. The farther
they went the more daylight showed be
tween Estado and his companions, until
he finally won by six telegraph poles. Be
hind h^n, ridden to his utmost capacity,
all sails set, Ike Tullett, with his hand on
the throttle and peeking out of the cab
window. Botany, the 6 to 5 favorite, fin
ished second, and Bicycle, on whom Kunz
pedaled hard with a punctured tire,
grabbed show honors. T'' :Â¦

dapper little bookie, John Mellin, fell the
last purse. . The route, seven furlongs.
Just suited the mare, and after a mild
drive, she downed Dollie Weithoff, the

Big Bill Knapp, who is here with the
Curl stable, made his first appearance at
the meeting on Sol Smith. Respirator,
which was on Saturday played down to
win a race from 25 to 6, took the scramble
from an uncanny assortment. Ridden by
Pico and 4^ to 1, the gelding easily dis
posed of Cherries and Billy Moore. Lee
Jackson rode the favorite, Loyal S., and
gathered nothing.
Duke sent the bunch away nicely, and
almost from the start the two favorites
showed in front. It resolved itself down
to a long drive, Frawley, astride Dr.
Rowell, earning: the decision over Ira
Powell, on Fox Lake," by the shortest of
noses. Potrero Grande, a brother to La
Goleta, had shown well jn his work, but
ran disappointingly. Miss May Bowdish
ran third. { .
Six running events were decided, and
as four first choices failed to report from
the firing line, it is needless to add, the
(syndicate) ring added to its exchequer.
Apparently the big bettors are still out on
their ranches, but the field book was at
tacked from all sides and riddled by the
dollar bettors, quitting losers.
There were ten starters for the Jona
than Club stake affive and a half fur
longs, worth $C30 to the winner. Dr. Row
ell and Fox Lake stood out In bold relief,
so the syndicators took the ram by the
horns and laid 6 to 5 on the Doctor, who
was coupled with his stable mate. May
Bowdish, and even money on the Chi
cago colt, who was coupled in the betting
with Sol Smith. Later on 8 to 5 was laid
about the latter pair. .
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 12.â The racing at
Agricultural Park this afternoon was lib
erally patronized, as it was "ladles' day,"
and the gate was placed at the pleasure
of the fair sex. The' one harness event
was called off for a lack of entries, which
caused a sigh of relief. The weather
was hot enough to cause blisters on the
grandstand roof shingles, and hundreds
of visitors registered at the refreshment
bureau. -

Special Dispatch to The CalL
The early morning handicap tourna
ment of the San v Franclsco Golf Club
against bogey, which began on Septem
ber 12, has been canceled. The condi
tions were that each competitor should
complete five rounrs of nine holes each,
match play, against bogey before 9
o'clock in the morning. Each competitor
received a handicap of strokes according
to his or her skill, the handicaps being
allotted by Robert Johnstone, the club
professional. Only five of the nine com
petitors who entered completed the five
rounds, Mrs. E. S. Miller and Miss Edith
Chcsebrough being prevented by the
rain, which fell on Friday morning, from
handing in* full returns. L. B. Edwards
won the prize offered for the event, being
three up against bogey in the five
rounds. The full details, with the num
ber 'of strokes given to each player, are
shown in tho table:
Jimmy Britt has been warned that he
has a hard game in the Italian, but Jimmy
is as confident as ever that he will win.
A large delegation will come from the in
terior to see the battle. A $10,00) house
is expected. There will be two good ten
round preliminaries between well-known
scrappers.
Modesty is one of Charley Seiger*B
worst fallings. The Italian lightweight
who is to battle twenty rounds with
Jimmy Britt next Friday night does very
little talking about himself. He allow3
his manager. Billy Roach, to handle that
part of the fighting game. As for himself,
he is there to wield his "mitts" and he
certainly knows how to do this to per
fection. Seiger is almost down to weight.
After eating a hearty lunch yesterday hÂ©
discarded his wearing apparel and stepped
on to the scales to satisfy the sporting
writers. The beam registered 136 pounds.
A smile of huge proportions crossed the
weather-beaten face of Roach and he
jubilantly said: "Well, I guess he'll be
down to weight all right, all right."
Seiger has until Friday night to make 133
pounds. He will certainly do this easily.
He says he will have no trouble doing so
and wants his admirers to believe him
when he says he will not be weakened.
He is a strong fellow. His muscular de
velopment is much better than Britt'a
and his determination to win is equal
to the local fighter's.
There was a big crowd at Seiger's train-
Ing quarters j at the ocean beach yester
day. Seiger boxed for the last time while
in training. His manager will not take
any chances of Seiger injuring his hand3.
He will keep him on the road and In the
gymnasium for the next three days.
.Seiger boxed with one, of his sparring
partners yesterday. He went two rounds
before a big crowd and when time was
called he did not take a long breath. He
is in superb condition. He says that had
he been in as good shape when he met
Gans he would have beaten the negro
champion.
Alec Greggains, manager of the San
Francisco Athletic Club, was over to see
Britt and reports that clever youth to be
in superb shape. Kddie Graney has been
selected to referee the contest. The bet
ting at the present time is 10 to 8, with
Britt favorite.
The sale of seats will open at Harry
Corbett's this morning. The attendance
will be very large, judging by the interest
taken in the fight. Even Britfs earnest
admirers want to see Jimmy tried out.
They think he is a champion and believe
that Seiger will make things interesting
for him. Seiger's twenty-round draw
with Rufe Turner and his splendid show
ing against Joe Gans prove he is a dan
gerous man.

Use of Drugs Shatters Reason.
CHICAGO, Oct. 12.â Mrs. ' Kate Mc-
Leary of this city, a writer of novels,
was adjudged insane -by a Jury to-day and
ordered placed in an asylum. The use of
drugs, to which she became addicted
through the administering of morphine
during a fever in 1S94, is said to have un
balanced her mind.
Criminals are generally scattered in branch
prisons â quartered in rude stockades without
proper sanitation, food or clothing. The aver
agÂ«r life of these . convicts is less than ten
years. Old and young are promiscuously
chained and herded together. - Even men and
women in some cases are not separated. Hard
ened i criminals and the boy convicted of his
first crime; the comparatively good,! the most
depraved, vile and abandoned , are chained
together. One warden of a State prison pro
tests in his report that "under. the present law
and customs i the penitentiary is tho school of
crime instead of- being a reformatory institu
tion." Of the boys under -18, nine-tenths of
them leave prisons much worse than when they
come In.

THE UF&*of3i
The most loathsome and repulsive of all N^lijfi/ _.â Tt rti ~â J iy
living things is the serpent, and the vilest and
most degrading of all human diseases is Contagious Blood Poison. The
serpent sinks its fangs into the flesh and almost instantly the poison passes
through the entire body. Contagious Blood Poison, beginning with, a little
ulcer, soon contaminates every drop of blood and spreads throughout the
whole system. Painful swellings appear in the groins, a red rash and
copper colored splotches break out on the body, the mouth, and throat
become ulcerated, and the hair and eye browsiall out ; but these symptoms
are mild compared to the wretchedness and suffering that come in the latter
stages of the disease when it attacks the bones and more vital parts of the
body. It is then that Contagious Blood Poison is seen in all its hideous-
ness. The deep eating abscesses and sickening ulcers and tumors show
the whole system is corrupted and poisoned, and unless relief comes soon
1 this serpent disease tightens its coils and crushes out the life. The only
antidote for the awful virus is S. S. S. It is nature's remedy, com-
S'_ posed entirely. of vegetable ingredients. S. S. S.
destroys every vestige of the poison, purifies the
V^^t blood and removes all danger of transmitting the
SÂ»3/ awful taint to others. Nothing else will do this.
Strong mineral remedies, like mercury and potash,
dry up the sores and drive in the disease, but do not cure permanently.
Send for our home treatment book and write us if in need of medical
advice or special inf onnation. This will cost you nothing.

Dennis Jordan, the well-known con
tractor, died last Sunday morning at
his residence, 633 Webster street, at the
age of 73 years, after an illness of a few
days.
The deceased was a familiar figure in
building circles. He laid the foundation
of the new City Hall and erected the bulk
of the main building, together with the
Hall of Records. He also built Branch
Jail No. 2, the shot tower, the Merchants'
Exchange, the old Starr King church and
other prominent buildings.
Dennis Jordan was particularly known
on account of his claims against the State
of California for work done at Folsom
prison. He claimed that a conspiracy
was formed to defraud him of. $00,000 and

Andre-w "Wallen Locks Wife Otrt of
Their Bedroom and Tarns
On Gas.
Andrew Wallen, formerly a saloon-keep
er at Commercial and Drumm streets,
was found dead from gas asphyrciatlon in
his room at 303 Minna street yesterday
morning. All indications point to deliber
ate ruicide. A canary bird in the same
room was also asphyxiated.
Mrs. Wallen, wife of the dead man,
etated that she had gone to a picnic with
C. A. Johnson and his wife Sunday, and
on ht-r return home she found the door to
her bedroom locked. Failing to arouse
her husband, she fpent the night with the
Johnsons, who live in the same house. At
7 o'clock the following morning she again
tried to sain admission to her room, but
the door was stiil locked. She says she
peeked through the keyhole and saw her
husband lying on the bed and his hands
were moving. Two hours later she again
tried the door, and then for the first time
noticed the odor of gas. She notified
Johnson, who assisted C. J. Tyler to crawl
through the transom. Wallen's life was
extinct. Both pas jets were turned on.
Deputy Coroner Fennell made an inves
tigation. Mrs. Wallc-n's statements were
corroborated by those in the house, and
the condition of the body showed that
death had resulted only a short time be
fore its discovers', tending to confirm her
t>tory of the time of death. As a matter
of precaution the police were notified, and
Detective Cody was detailed to inquire
Into the case. He reported that death
was undoubtedly due to suicide.
Walk n was 2S years of age and a native
'Â¦f Sweden. His wife dtnied that there
had been any trouble between them. It
was claimed by those living in the house
that he had frequently threatened to com
mit suicide and was generally of a mel
pncholy disposition.

ABOUND PEAKS
REPRESENTATIVE mining men
will assemble to-day at the Odd
Fellows' Cemetery in this city
_to pay the last token of respect
to John F. Parks, who died at the
Kennedy mine last Saturday. The remains
were brought here last evening, accompa
nied by Code Commissioner John F. Davis
and Fred W. Bradley, sons-in-law of the
deceased. The services will take place in
the chapel at the cemetery to-day at 11
o'clock.
John F. Parks was an exponent of the
mining industry in California. At the
time of his death he was the superintend
ent of the Kennedy mine. That position
he had occupied since February 1. 1S87.
Befqre he assumed the duties of that po
sitio'n he was the foreman of the Key
stone mine, where he was located many
years. In the long period represented by
these two engagements Mr. Parks was
one of the most conspicuous figures on
the mother lode. He had fine executive
ability, excellent judgment and a thor
ough acquaintance with the practical
problems that he was called upon con
stantly to solve. Upon his judgment
much reliance was placed by the Kennedy
Mining Company.
All mining men speak of Mr. Parks as
having been upright in all hl3 relations.
He was faithful to the interests of the
company. To all men he was fair. His
will was strong. His was a determined
personality. His friends were strongly
held to him by reason of his Qualities.
Mr. Parks crossed the plains to Califor
nia in the early days from Missouri. He
went soon to the mines of California,
Later he was the timberman for the
Ophir mine on the Comstock lode.- He
was called from Nevada to serve in Cali
fornia, his reputation having already been
established. He never went from the
mother lode for employment after begin
ning his work there.
At all times from the. date of Its organi
zation Mr. Parks was a prominent mem
ber of the California Miners' Association.
He was on the executive committee, rep
resenting Amador County, and was presi
dent of the Amador County branch of the
association. Two years ago he wa3 run
over by a street car while In this city to
attend the annual convention of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association. By this mis
hap he was disabled for some time. Later
he met with another accident. He had
been ailing several months. Last Decem
ber he caught a heavy cold, and this was
followed by pneumonia. Since then he
had not been well. He died of "miners'
consumption."
At one time Mr. Parks was a member
of the board of trustees of the State Min
ing Bureau by appointment of Governor
Budd. His other duties were too pressing
to permit him to attend to the trusteeship
and he resigned the place.
A widow and four children survive. The
daughters are Mrs. John P. Davis and
Mrs. F. W. Bradley. "The sons are J. F.
Parks Jr. and Samuel T. Parks. The last
named has been in Korea, where he has
been engaged in gold mining. Some time
ago he started for home, and is due soon
in this city, where a sad surprise awaits
him. The mother of John F. Parks sur
vives in Missouri at the advanced age of
90 years. ;

The judgment of the Circuit Court was
reversed and the prisoners ordered dis
charged.
" After, the men had been sent to the
penitentiary their attorneys applied last
July for a writ of habeas corpus to the
United States Circuit Court of Washing
ton. United . States District Judge de
Haven of this city was sitting temporarily
in the Washington court in Seattle and
denied the petition for the writ. The mat
tar was then taken to the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals.
Through thÂ© blunder of a Federal law
officer two men under sentence of im
prisonment in the penitentiary were re
leased yesterday by the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals. The prisoners
are Charles Mackey and J. Archie Mc-
Leod. They were convicted of having on
July 26, 1902, flred with a revolver and a
shotgun upon C. -T. Stranahan, superin
tendent of the Nez Perces Indian Reser
vation in Idaho' while Stranahan was
making a search for spirituous liquors
which had been unlawfully Introduced
into the reservation. The prisoners -were
prosecuted under section 6 of "an act to
further prevent smuggling and. for other
purposes."
Judge Gilbert in rendering the opinion
of the Court of Apoeala said: "It is as
clear as words can make it that the act
refers only to offenses committed againat
officers of the customs, their deputies and
persons assisting them in the execution
of their duties, and that it has no appli
cation to an act done in resistance of an
Indian agent in making searches or
seizures upon an Indian reservation."

ilrs. Florence Percy Matheson and Mrs.

On the suggestion of Sarah E. Reamer,
It was resolved to send a message of sym
pathy to the family ot the late Colonel
Richard Savage.
At the conclusion cf the serious busl
r.css cf the convention the members ad
jourr.ed for luncheon, and later assembled
tv:th their friends to enjoy the social pro
gramme, which was opened by Miss
I>;uise Grosset, who captivated her audi
ence with her extremely beautiful voice
end her fascinating singing of "Chanson
l'rover.cait 1 " and "Oh, That We Two
"Were Maying." "Miss Blanche Vilas fol
lowed with a reading from "Mrs. WIggs
cf the Cabbage Patch," and received well
merited applause. Mrs. Arristeene Schultz
contributed the song "Morning and Even
ing," and so superbly was it rendered that
Mrs. Schultz was complimented with
reusing applause, and in response to de
zncuids for another vocal contribution sang
the negro ditty "Phoebe" in pure and
j Â« rfect tone and with heart feeling.
MISS HOAG WATTES HIT.
The reading of "The Widow Doodles,"
l>y Miss Laurena Elizabeth Hoag, con
%-ulse-d everybody. It was so full of com
edy, so clean cut in action and so able a
j.icture of the disconsolate widow as to
entitle Miss Hoag to a foremost position
in the ranks of readers. The young lady
v/as vociferously encored, and for her
eecond number gave one of James Whit
ccrnb Riley's gems, and again the reader
von honors.
The programme terminated with a read
ir.g by Jack London entitled "Coronation
l>ay."
Miss Evelyn Sresovich 1 acted as accom
panist In a manner that won her not
elcne the thanks of the vocalists, but also
the appreciation of the association and its
puests.
The Pacific Coast Women's Press As
sociation held its annual convention yes
terday, when, besides the election of of
ficers for the ensuing year, a social, mu
sical and literary reception took place,
the programme of which was noted for its
exceptional excellence.
The election and business of the asso
ciation took up the whole of the morning,
the choice of efflcers resulting as follows:
Outside the two windows which give
light and air to the room is a ledge of
granite four inches wide and set at an
angle of 40 decrees from the wall. Six
feet away in an ansle of the wall is a
tin pipe running vertically from the roof
to the sidewalk to carry off rainwater.
It is doubtful whether this pipe would
bear the weight of a man. The theory
was advanced by Mr. North that the five
Chinese fishermen stepped out -upon the
window ledge and swung to the pipe with
the aid of an electric light wire that was
dangling from the room and then slid
down the pipe to the ground. But there
was not a scratch on the pipe- A sock
was found on the sidewalk near the
drain but whether it had been worn by
a Chinese or a white man only a sleuth
cculd determine.
The men were being detained pending
the examination of their right to be in
this country. They arrived from the
Alaska canneries on the steamer Queen.
It was the painful duty yesterday of
ChinesÂ© Inspector Charles Mehan to write
a report to his superior officer. Hart H.
North, United - States Immigrant Com
missioner, concerning the whys, hows and
wherefores of the escape of the third
batch cf Chinese prisoners durins the
month from, the custody of the Chinese
Bureau. It was likewise the painful duty
of United States Immigrant Commission
er North to write to his superior officer
In WaBhinffton, D. C, an account of the
hows and the whys and the wherefores
of thÂ© escape of the aforesaid missing
third batch within the month. The last
escapes were five in number. They were
locked in the Grand Jury Â« room on the
fourth floor of the Appraiser's building
last Saturday evening and W. Randolph,
a watchman In the service of the Chinese
Bureau, was placed on guard In thÂ© hall.
At ll:Â« p. m. Randolph was relieved
by Frederic J. Hooper, another watch
man. At 7 a. m. Captain M. S. Black
burn, in command of the watch, arrived.
They looked into the room and found it
empty. The door had been locked all
night and the transom over the door lead
ing to the fourth floor corridor was open
for ventilation.

CHICAGO. Oct. 12.â The sentiment in the
wheat pit was decidedly favorable to the bears
and the nrws in general had a depressing in
fluence. Torelgn markets did not respond to
the advance here Saturday and thiÂ« fact, to
fiether with the Government crop report Issued
Saturday, showing a larger yield than gener
ally expected, caused lower prices at the start.
December being down ',i<6Vic to V4@%c at
78 t /k@79c. Thf re was little disposition to buy,
and with outside market! more or Ie38 de
pressed the: market here showed signs of
demoralization with trading very spasmodic.
After selling at 7OV6c. December started down
ward and with the exception of slight rallies
at different times, the trend was toward a
lower level. December closed %c lower at
78Vi@78*Â»c.
Corn ruled weak along with wheat and
partly on the bearish crop report. December
closed lc lower at 44%@44%c
Oats declined with other grains with selling
by commission houses and local longs the main
features. December closed %c lower at 37 '4 c.
Smaller receipts of hogs and higher prices
at Ihe yards were factors In creating a firm
tone- in provisions, and although tho weakness
In corn had some effect, prices were well
maintained. Trading was quiet throughout the
day. The close was firm, with January pork
12Vic higher, lard was up 17',4c and ribs 5@
7>4c higher.

NEW YORK. Oct. 12.â The stock market
fpent a bad half day up to noon, Nit during
the latter part of the da>\ a little better spirit
fhowfii Itself and there was some recovery.
There was a veritable slaughter ff values
amonsc tlie industrials durine the morning and
it was very evident that the disfavor caused
by the developments last week in the United
States Shipbuilding receivership case Is etill
an active force In the market Industrial
stocks were sold at violent declines without
apparent discrimination, juat as they were
bought during the period- of prosperity In the
stock r<romouon pr<Â«cess. It is not to be sup
posed that all of the present sellers of these
securities, however, received their first en
lightenment from the shipbuilding muddle of
the processes employed in the promotion, un
derwriting and flotation of industrial stocks
during the last few years. Over-capitalization,
over-valuation or constituent companies and
market manipulation by the managers for in
sldr pwls have been flagrantly in evidence and
have l>een persistently pointed out from the
outset. Now it is evident that the speculative
public is paying exaggerated importance to
every sufgeotlon in this direction, while It
f.Â«emÂ« a warrantable presumption that the In
vesting class is in a state of disgust which
turns them from all consideration of the in
dustrial sticks. Promotion deals which have
been he'd ut'on a state of partial icnaumma
tion. with the hope of later completion, are
now regarded as hopeless failure*. 1 he throw
ing out of collateral for loans of some of
the securities in disfavor Is another case for
their sacrifice in the market at wlile declines,
and the prevailing ease of the monoy market
ani the growing confidence In Its continuance
do not avail to overcome the repugnance to
this collateral for loans.
The early stock market suffered additional
depression Jn response to London selling on
account of the acute Etaee reached in the dis
pute between Russia and Japan.
The prevailing state of mind over the mar
ket had Its rreateft effect upon the ITnited
Htatfs Steel btocks. and both touched new low
records to-day, the common selling at 17'j
and the preferred at 57H-
The bonds were somewhat better supported.
The list of losses in the industrial department
running from 2 to 12 points Is " too long to
recapitulate. A number of Inactive railroad
stocks also suffered severely. Reports of large
reductions in working force by the New York
Central and Southern Pacific had a strong
efleot on sentiment, following last week's reso
lution of the United States Steel Corporation
to reduce iÂ«Â« working force. With the com
pletion of the London selling better op|Â»ortunity
was given for the effect of the unexpectedly
favorable Government crop report cl Satur
day to assert Itself. The very sanguine view
expressed by railroad operating officials over
the outlook for traffic and their reports of the
large current traffic also helped the recovery.
The cloeinff vag about steady and elightly be
low the best.

If you get The .Call to helpâ let uÂ« have your ad to-day.NAPA. Oct. 12.â A runaway occurred
here yesterday In which Sirs. George
Moss, a prominent resident, was serious
ly Injured.. A doe jumpÂ«d out suddenly
on the street and frishtened the horse
of William Kelly. The. animal shied and
threw out Kelly, overturning the buggy.
Kelly was not badly hurt.
Out Third street the horse ran and Into
the Asylum road. It smashed Into tha
carriage In which Mrs. George Moss was
riding. Mrt. Moss was thrown out and
badly cut about the face and head.
The frantic animal kept up tha rapid
pace into the asylum grounds and around
to the barn. The buggy was badly dam
aged. The physicians are unable to tell
at present how seriously Mrs. Moss Is
Injured.
Trick Automobilingr.
Although trick autamobllists can, be
found la France and England, this coun
try claims tha lead. Tha accomplishment
is peculiarly well adapted to American
genius. Another reason for the su
premacy of Americans U the greater
lightness of the American machines.
taken as a class, and their extreme sen
sitiveness and delicacy of control. It is,
of course, possible to do more with a light
car than with a Ijeavy French racer. An
other condition leading to the develop
ment of trick chauffeurs In America Is tha
encouragement given by the manufactur
ers, who favor trials of skill because they
serve to exhibit machines and demon
strate to possible purchasers the lightness
and facility with which automobiles may
be controlled.
There are several tricks which may be
classed as favorites anior.gr chauffeurs.
They are all extremely difficult, but the
one which more nearly borders on thÂ«
marvelous U the watch trick. Only the
most expert chauffeurs attempt it, as the
cost of failure Is the cost of a watch. To
drive an automobile against an open
watch, to back It and expect to stop the
heavy machine just in time to spare the
watch, seems Impossible, but the feat has
often been performed â Leslie's Weekly.
John Eliot's Indian Bible, of 1665. was

ervation. Twq other copies of this Bible
are in existence, one In Connecticut, tha
other in Europe.

Wilson disagreed with Brandenstein and
pointed to a provision of the charter that
vests the power of appointing any city
official, not otherwise provided for, in the
hands of the Mayor.
As there was no quorum the committee
postponed consideration until to-morrow
at 4 d. m.
"The Dower to appoint a Poundmaster
lies with the Board of Supervisors," said
Brandenstein, "and the delegation of the
authority' to the Mayor is unwarranted
by â¢ the charter. . It is for the Supervi
sors to determine who shall be the Pound
master." "â¢ ' :-'â¢'â¢>!!/
The , Supervisors' joint Committee on
Finance and License lacked a quorum
yesterday when it began consideration of
the proposition to take the management
of the public pound out of the hands of
H. -O;' Irwin, the Mayor's appointee.
Chairman Brandenstein stated that the
Police Commission did not want to un
dertake the management of the pound
and that it would be necessary to con
sider the offer of the Pacific Humane
Society, which was willing to run the
pound free of cost to the city, and also
that of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, which agreed to run
the sound and turn all fees over to the
city if the board would appropriate $6000
yearly for Its maintenance. Brandenstein
plainly intimated that the board desired
to oust Irwin from the position of Pound
master.
The petitioner is apparently unaware of
the charter provision that requires a two
thirds affirmative vote before any public
utility can be acquired by the city. The
petition was referred to the Public Utili
ties Committee. - '-,

and Gentlemen: On behalf of the Grand
Lodge of California, Free and Accented Ma
Â«;nis. It is with treat pleasure that this Im
portant trust, requested of us to perform, is
accepted.
We would at this time thank you for- the
many courtesies and kindnesses extended to
us; vour hospitality is boundless and words
cannot express our appreciation.
We shall houe. as a great fraternity, that
this day's work may be one of mutual pleas
ure and profit to us all.
You. ae an integral part of our great and
glorious Golden State, matchless and peerless
as a sparkling gem In our nation's golden
coronet, are building up a great commonwealth,
end to-day is marked with an event which
will undoubtedly be long remembered.
In accepting the gift the recipient de
livered the following address:
GRAND MASTER SPEAKS.
We have assembled here to-day for the
purpose of laying the cornerstone of King
Solomon's Temple and although it will not
be as costly, will not be as spacious, will not
tie as dazzling In its splendor as King Solo
mon's Temsle of ancient Masonic history, yet
we have reason to believe that it Trill be more
enduring, more beneficial In Its results upon
the generation of men who will follow, here
after.
No barbarous force will ever raze the walls
of the temple which we here will build.
King Solomon's Lodge No. 260 for almost
a quarter of u century has been laying corner
stones of Individual character. To-day we
lay the cornerstone of what will be a fitting
testimonial for all time to the very best en
deavors cf its members, a lasting monument
to :i3|. <Â¦ ric'.r.al founders and a spacious and
comnSÂ«iious temnle to assist us In the erec
tion of the moral edifices of. its initiates.
And now, tnoct worshipful grand master, the
toundation having been well begun. It re
mains lor me to Invite you as most worshlD-
Tul grand master to proceed to the laying
cf this cornerstone, and for thai purpose I
present you with this Implement with which
to perform this work and request that you
retain It as a. souvenir of this important oc
casion.
The worshipful master then presented
to the grand master a beautiful silver
trowel with ivory handle. It was in
scribed as follower
"Presented to Most Worshipful Grand
Master Orrin S. Henderson at the laying
of the cornerstone of the Temple of King
Solomon Lodge No. 2C0. Free and Ac
cepted Masons, October 12, 1903."
On the reverse side was the insignia of
the order.
Worshipful Master William P. Filmer
made the opening address, which was as
follows :
Most worshipful grand master, officers and
members of the Grand Lodge, brethren and
friends: t\> read in the holy writings that
It was decreed in the wisdom and councils
of Deity aforetime lhat a house thould be
built, erected to God and dedicated to his
holy same.
Here all assembled upon a large tem
porary platform decked with flags, while
the band played "The Holy City." Ser
vices were conducted by the Grand Lodge
end began promptly at noon.
Rev. Jacob Nieto stepped slowly to the
middle of the platform and offered up a
prayer, which impressed every one most
profoundly by its beauty of diction and its
earnestness of endeavor.
GRAND LODGE OFFICIALS.
Promptly at 11 o'clock the stately pro
cession started from the Masonic Temple.
First came a platoon of police, followed
by four buglers of the United States army
from the Presidio. Then followed the drill
corps of the California Commandery,
which acted as escort to the officers of
the Grand Lodge. The members were all
clad in the rich velvet uniforms of the or
der and mounted on black chargers. Then
came the officers of the Grand Lodge in
carriages and last came the most wor
ehipful grand master, riding in an open
carriage drawn by four pure white horses.
As the cavalcade started the buglers
blew a royal fanfare and the procession
moved up Market street to Golden Gate
avenue, thence up Fillmore street to the
Western Addition Masonic Temple, where
It was Joined by the members of King
Solomon's Lodge, who. with Golden Gate
Commander}' No. 16, as escort, proceeded
to the site of the new temple.
The ceremonies were conducted by
Grand Master Orrin Staples Henderson.
The cornerstone of the new King Solo
mon Masonic Temple, to be erected on
FlUmore street, between Post and Sutter,
â¢was laid yesterday with ceremonies of
the most impressive order. The day was
perfect. A great crowd was in attend
ance, which included about BOO members
of the fraternity, besides several thou
sand lookers on. who filled all the avail
able street space within hearing or see
ing distance, while all the adjacent roofs
and windows were filled with people who
listened with rapt attention to the pro
ceedings.
The roadway of Alabama street, be
tween Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth,
was fully accepted.
The ordinance providing for the doing
of street work o'n Fourth avenue, be
tween Hugo and H streets, was passed to
print.
The petition of the United RaJ*oads for
permission to maintain an oil storage tank
of 2.520,000 gallons or 60.000 barrels capac
ity was referred to the Fire Committee.
The petition of the Laborers' Protective
Union for an Increase from $2 50 to J3 per
day In the wages of all laborers em
ployed by the city was referred to the-
Joint committee on Finance and Streets,
which will meet next Friiay at 2 p. m.
The amended ordinance exempt' ne em
ployes of the Fire Department and De
partment cf .electricity, the Fire Marshal,
the Underwriters' Fire Patrol, the ortlco
of the Pacific Telephone Compai.y and the
headquartirs of the Veteran Volunteer
Firemen's Association from the payment
of fees for the. installation and mainte
nance of tapper gongs to connect with
the Fire and Police Telegraph syatsrn waa
referred to the Joint Fire and Police Com
mittee.
A proposed ordinance providing for the
registration by the Chief of Police of per
sons engaged in the business of lock
smithing, for the issuance of licenses for
such business and making it unlawful for
any person not registered and licensed
as a locksmlO: to engage in the business
of locksmithlng was referred yesterday lo
the Joint Police and Judiciary Committee
by the Board of Supervisors.
The ordinance was Introduced by Super
visor Walsh at the request of the Master
Locksmiths 1 , Electricians' and General'
Repairers' Association and is approved
by Chief of Police Wittman. The associa
tion calls attention to the fact that al
leged irresponsible parties having no fixed
place' of business make a practice of tak
ing out the inner mechanism of locks and
also have in their possession skeleton
keys and Â¦' facilities for selling the same
to any. one who desires to use them for
unlawful, purposes. Also that records of
the Police Department show that by these
means vacan; houses are looted of ihe:r
plumbing and ga3 fixtures and rconu in
hotels and lodging-houses are robbed and
trunks opened.
The ordinance fixes the license at $2 50
per annum. : No license will be issued to
soliciting locksmiths and the ordinance
makes It unlawful for any hardware mer
chant to sell cut keys of any description
to any person but a licensed locksmith.
Action on the ordinance restricting tha
operation of any machine propelled by
electricity, gasoline, Â«team or ot!;er power
en any sidewalk or street, which is es
pecially aimed at the compressed air
housecleaning machines, was postponed
until November 9. This course was
agreeable to the supporters of the ordi
nance.
The following members of the Grand
Lodge of California took part in the cere
monies: '
O. S. Henderson, grand master: C. W. Nut
ting, deputy grand master; G. W.' Hunter,
senior grand warden : W. S. Moses. I Junior grand

Hartley, senior grand steward; Orel- M. Gold
aracf na, grand permilvant; Samuel D. Â¦ Mayer,
grand organist, and George P. Adams, grand
tyler.
The musical part of the programme was
In charge of Grand Organist Samuel D.
Mayer and was ably, carried out by the
King Solomon choir, , consisting of D.'.M.
Lawrence. R. >W.: Smith, A. Batkln and
L. A. Larscn. The hymns chosen were ap
propriate to the laying of the cornerstone:
'.'Great Architect of Earth and Heaven,""
"Thou Eternal, Thou ' Exalted," "Corn,
Wine and Oil" and "Behold, the Lord
Hath Laid."
MUSIC IS APPROPRIATE.
He closed with a grand peroration upon
the subject in question, which brought out
a great storm of applause.
All assembled then joined in a mighty
chorus, singing the doxology, and the
grand chaplain concluded the services by
offering the benediction.
He referred to the greatness of the lives
of Washington and Lincoln, to their
steadfastness of purpose, and said that in
every emergency In life they were suffi
cient. Theirs were characters that shone
with such brilliancy out into* the world
that their lights could never be dimmed
and could never Â¦ fade. Theirs were the
characters of menâ characters that we all
should try to emulate.'
Knowledge was to be sought for, - but
character waa higher than Intellect. Re
ferring to the temple, he said: "This is
not to be so beautiful as Solomon's tem
ple of old, but the teachings of the order
that possesses it â¢will live for centuries,
for they are the teachings that emanate
from character and manhood. Manhood
Is the truest test of greatness."
WASHINGTON AND LINCOLN.
Then followed the placing of the copper
box in the cornerstone, attended by the
usual formalities. It contained a record
of the proceedings of the Grand Lodge, F.
and A. M., in' Calif ornia in 1902; a copy of
the constitution of the Grand Lodge, F.
and-A.Â«M., of the same year; a copy of
Anderson's Manual, 1902; photographs of
officers of King Solomon's Lodge; a cop
perplate card containing the names of
the associate architects, Fred Burrage
"Wood, William Glen Copeland and Charles
Vincent Pierce; a Columbian half-dollar,
1903; United States coin donated by A.
Hagedon and other coins, list of names of
Grand Lodge officers, list of names of
King Solomon Lodge members, names of
board of directors of Western Addition
Masonic Hall Association, names of com
mittee of arrangements; copies of daily
papers of October 12, 1903â San Francisco
Call, San Francisco Chronicle and San
Francisco Examiner; copy of the Trestle
Board and copy of by-laws of King Solo
mon's Lodge. -
As soon as the stone bad been placed
in position the grand orator, E. H. Hart,
delivered an oration, choosing for his sub
ject "The Idea and Intents of the Ma
sonic Fraternity.'.' He began by paying a
glowing tribute to the men and women of
this State/ and took up the theme he had
chosen j for his discourse. Manliness, he
said, was the chief factor that built and
maintained the order.

We do not sigh. 'No more will bloom again!'
Nor cry. 'No other throat will sing that strain!'

The tender promise of the dawn we know.
Though dark the evening's wane.

Unto their goal by an appointed way.
Let us not vainly murmur and delay.

sion on this sphere. - â¢;
"Why turn we back to our lost yesterday.
With faltering feet and wistful, weeping eyes?

Smiles not as green 'to-morrow's' budding field
That before us lies?
It is understood that the plea of tem
porary insanity will be made in the courts
on behalf of the prisoner.
Sophie Jordan testified that her sister
had kept company with the prisoner for
about four years, their engagement hav
ing been broken about a year ago. The
estrangement between him and her sister
she ascribed to the thrlftles shablts of Dc
Labrousse, Marie not having confidence
1st his ability to support her properly.
Leroy Harvey and J. Gambarini, eye
witnesses of the shooting, which took
place on September 29 in front of the Jor
dan home at 1459 Sacramento street, re
peated the statements they made to the
police shortly after the murder. They saw
De Labrousse shoot Marie three times
and then. fire a bullet into his own head.
That was just after the girl had stepped
inside the garden gate.
Dr. Lulgi Domenlco Bacigalupi, autopsy
surgeon for the Coroner, testified as to
the location of the three wounds in the
dead girl's body. He said that any one
of them would have been fatal. The bul
lets found by him in the wounds were of
38-caliber and fitted the revolver used by
De Labrousse. _*:'.*Â¦"> -';
He was brought handcuffed Into the In
quest room by Detective Reynolds, and as
soon as his eyes fell upon Sophie Jordan*
a sister of his victim, he sank Into a
chair, exclaiming: In heart-broken accents,
"My God! Marie! Marie!" He presented a
wretched appearance with the shadow of
his grief dark upon him and the white
bandages around his head covering the
â¢wound that marked his effort at suicide.
After hearing the testimony in the mat
ter of the Inquest upon the body of Marie
Jordan the Coroner's jury yesterday ren
dered a verdict charging her rejected
suitor, Edward de Labrousse, with mur
der. The Inquest did not develop any
thing new except the remorse of the mur
derer.
